<HEAD>TO The most renowned, most formidable, and most tremendous KNIGHT, GIANT, and <HI>GRAND CALUMNIATOR-GENERAL,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Quilsylvania,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MOST DREADFUL SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to approach your IMMENSITY with the <HI>first Attempt</HI> of a young Genius, ambitious of distinguishing himself in that most noble and most honourable of all Arts—the ART OF CALUMNY.</P>
<P>THE Voice of Mankind would condemn me, were I, on this Occasion, to sollicit the Patronage of any other than "You, SIR, the great CALUM∣NIATOR of the Province, whose dire Delight was ever in the Carnage of Characters, and who, like some GIANT in Romance, sit viewing, with hor∣rid Pleasure, the mangled Limbs of murdered Reputations strow'd all around your Castle."</P>
<P>TO you, Sir, are we indebted for those Volumes of unparallel'd Obloquy and Slander, which have so largely contributed to the Happiness of this flou∣rishing Province.—Not that you deign'd to write yourself (tho' so highly capable) but that you gra∣ciously promoted Writing in others.</P>
<P>SPEAKING, Sir, is your <HI>Excellence!</HI> Your Mouth alone can utter more true genuine Detraction in one Hour, than all the <HI>learned</HI> Doctors of the College (assisted by the <HI>decent</HI> Mr. <HI>D-ve</HI> and the <HI>magna∣nimous</HI> Mr. <HI>D—n</HI>) can discharge from their calumniating Pens in a Fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010014_0003_0F7B98756D7AB728"/>LET a Man but dare to appear even <HI>in Defence</HI> of the Character of his Friend, his Relation, or himself; and, in an Instant, you besmear and cover him with such a thick Slime of Slander, that was it not for that powerful <HI>Menstruum</HI> called TRUTH, he would scarcely ever become so cleansed as to be known again by his former Acquaintance.</P>
<P>SUCH are the happy Effects of your Voyages to <HI>England</HI> in your youthful, and later Days! For such are the Advantages which have resulted to you from a close Attendance on the Lectures of those celebrated Mistresses of our Art, the —NAIADS <HI>of</HI> BILLINGSGATE!</P>
<P>I am fully sensible, Sir, that this Performance will, in Point of <HI>pure unadulterated Scurrility,</HI> fall far short of those excellent Pieces which your Patronage has lately been the Means of procuring for the Benefit of Society. Should it, however, be the happy Means of my obtaining your Pro∣tection and Encouragement, I cannot but flatter myself that I may, fired with Emulation, hereafter rival the <HI>Sentiment-Dresser-General</HI> himself!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Observations</HI> on Mr. H—s's <HI>Advertisement,</HI> tho' highly season'd with Scurrility, are yet vastly inferior in that Respect to the <HI>Answer</HI> to Mr. F—n's <HI>Remarks.</HI> For this Reason I chose the former for the Subject of my <HI>first Essay,</HI> hoping that if I should be so lucky as to succeed in imitating <HI>That,</HI> I might in Time rise to an Imitation of the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>UNPARDONABLE would it be, Sir, were I to pass over in Silence the Obligations you have con∣ferred on all <HI>British</HI> America, in so wisely and bravely <HI>daring</HI> the Ministry and Parliament to burthen us
<PB N="v" REF="010014_0003_0F7B98756D7AB728"/>
with Taxes. The good Effects of this <HI>Policy</HI> are now most sensibly felt, and must ever be held in grateful Remembrance.</P>
<P>NOR should I forget to mention, how much this Province is peculiarly beholden to you for the Intro∣duction of <HI>Clubs, Corruption</HI> and <HI>Perjury</HI> at our an∣nual <HI>Elections;</HI> than which nothing could have been better adapted for the Preservation of that valuable Part of our Privileges.</P>
<P>AS well might I omit to acknowledge the Services you have rendered this Country, in promoting the Cultivation of the <HI>fine Arts.</HI> The Public Spirit, and Liberality of the famous Society in England, are no ways comparable to what you have exerted and shown on this Account. The Art of <HI>Engraving,</HI> in particular, which was thought to be on its Decline among <HI>Britons,</HI> has, by your <HI>generous Bounty,</HI> and under your <HI>Auspices,</HI> been lately carried to a Height of Perfection unknown to the most able Masters, antient or modern.</P>
<P>SUFFER me likewise, Sir, to congratulate you and the Public, on your new-form'd Alliance with that SCUNK OF SCURRILITY <HI>D—d J—s D-ve!</HI> From an Union of such <HI>kindred Souls</HI> what Blessings may not be expected!</P>
<P>Our ART must flourish to its full Extent,</P>
<P>When <HI>D-ve</HI> shall <HI>write</HI> what <HI>Al—n</HI> shall <HI>invent!</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, such is your unbounded Benevolence of Soul, that, not contented with bestowing Favours on <HI>British</HI> America in general, you have even exten∣ded your Obligations to the declared Enemies of your King and Country!—generously supplying them in the Time of their Distress with <HI>Warlike Stores</HI> and <HI>Provisions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="010014_0004_0F7B9875B7B5CF70"/>NOR have you, Sir, been more attentive to that Pre∣cept of the Gospel, <HI>Love your Enemies,</HI> than you have to that Observation of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, <HI>Charity covers a Multitude of Sins:</HI> For tho' your <HI>Charities</HI> have in Reality bore no Proportion to what many others have performed, (your and their respective Estates considered) yet have you, by your Wisdom and Skill in <HI>spreading</HI> them abroad, so <HI>covered</HI> many of your Vices, that they are scarcely obser∣vable to any but Persons of nice Discernment and Pene∣tration.</P>
<P>HERE, Sir, were I to tread in the beaten Track of Dedicators, I should mention your great Knowledge in Law, Physick and Divinity, the Mathematics, Natural and Experimental Philosophy, and, above all, the pro∣found Science of <HI>Politics!</HI> Nor should I fail to express my Hopes that you would suffer yourself to be prevailed upon to oblige the World with the Publication of some of those excellent Treatises which your leisure Hours have produced on those Subjects.</P>
<P>THIS Flattery might perhaps be agreeable to some of the inferior Race of Mortals, who are apt to value them∣selves on the Reputation of possessing <HI>Useful Knowledge:</HI> But Beings of your Order, I am persuaded, would be far better pleased to hear themselves complimented on their great Skill in the NOBLE ART OF CALUMNY, than cele∣brated as Masters of every Branch of Erudition.</P>
<P>ALLOW me, Sir, tho' you are generally so obligingly condescending as to save others the Trouble of sounding your Praise, just to observe, That your Politeness is equal with your Wit—Your Merit equal with your Under∣standing —Your Love of Truth equal with your Love of Mr. <HI>Fr—n.</HI></P>
<P>I have the Honour to be, with the profoundest Respect,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is generally expected from an Author, that he should <HI>preface</HI> his Performance, in order to acquaint his Readers with the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Work they are about to enter upon, and his <HI>Motive</HI> for writing. These may be easily collected from the Title Page, and the fol∣lowing Prologue of <HI>Fielding</HI>'s, which I give the Reader as it is adapted to my Purpose, and as I doubt not but he will be far better pleased to have some good Poetry of that Author's, than any Thing I can furnish.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE to the <HI>Coffee-House Politician,</HI> or the JUSTICE <HI>caught in his own</HI> TRAP.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN ancient Greece, the infant Muse's School,</L>
<L>Where Vice first felt the Pen of Ridicule,</L>
<L>With honest Freedom and impartial Blows,</L>
<L>The Muse attack'd each Vice as it arose:</L>
<L>No Grandeur could the <HI>mighty Villain</HI> screen</L>
<L>From the just Satyr of the comic Scene:</L>
<L>No <HI>Titles</HI> could the daring Poet cool,</L>
<L>Nor save the great-<HI>great honourable Fool.</HI></L>
<L>They spar'd not even the Aggressor's <HI>Name,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>publick Villainy</HI> felt <HI>publick Shame.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long hath this gen'rous Method been disus'd,</L>
<L>For Vice hath grown <HI>too great</HI> to be abus'd;</L>
<L>By <HI>Pow'r defended</HI> from the piercing Dart,</L>
<L>It reigns and triumphs in the <HI>Judge</HI>'s Heart,</L>
<L>While <HI>Beaux,</HI> and <HI>Cits,</HI> and <HI>Squires,</HI> our Scenes afford,</L>
<L>Justice preserves the Rogues who wield her Sword;</L>
<L>All Satyr against her Tribunal's quash'd,</L>
<L>Nor lash the Bards, for fear of being lash'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the heroick Muse who sings to Night,</L>
<L>Through these neglected Tracks attempts her Flight:</L>
<L><HI>Vice</HI> cloath'd with <HI>Pow'r,</HI> she <HI>combats</HI> with her Pen,</L>
<L>And fearless, <HI>dares</HI> the LYON in his Den.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="viii" REF="010014_0005_0F7B98767193B238"/>
<L>Then only <HI>Reverence</HI> to <HI>Pow'r</HI> is due,</L>
<L>When <HI>publick Welfare</HI> is its <HI>only View:</HI></L>
<L>But when the Champions, whom the Publick arm</L>
<L>For <HI>their own Good</HI> with Pow'r, <HI>attempt their Harm,</HI></L>
<L>He sure must meet the general Applause,</L>
<L>Who <HI>'gainst</HI> those <HI>Traytors</HI> fights the <HI>publick Cause.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And while these Scenes the <HI>conscious Knave</HI> displease,</L>
<L>Who <HI>feels within</HI> the <HI>Criminal</HI> he sees,</L>
<L>The <HI>uncorrupt</HI> and <HI>good</HI> must <HI>smile,</HI> to find</L>
<L>No Mark for <HI>Satyr</HI> in his <HI>generous</HI> Mind.</L>

<P>As to any other <HI>Motive</HI> I had in writing, I can with Truth assure my Reader, that I should not have thought of putting Pen to Paper on this Subject, after perusing what Mr. <HI>H—</HI> published in Answer to <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Observations</HI> on his <HI>Advertisement,</HI> had I not been stimulated thereto by the Appearance of a <HI>Print</HI> published by the Pr—ry Party a few Days after, with a View of blackening the Reputations of some of the most valuable Men in the Community.</P>
<P>When I was credibly informed, that the chief Magistrate of <HI>Quilsylvania</HI> was principally instrumental in obtaining that extraordinary Production, and that he even gave the Author a considerable Sum of Money to enable him to bring his Perfor∣mance into the World, tho' that very Author was well known to have frequently lampoon'd him and his Adherents, I could not but promise myself, that should I likewise be able to succeed in lashing them severely, he might also think it proper to <HI>buy</HI> me over to his Party, and afford me that Encourage∣ment and Assistance which are so necessary to a young Author of slender Fortune.</P>
<P>When I first form'd the Resolution of attacking the Ch—f and his Party, it was my Purpose to endeavour to use the Weapons of delicate Satire and Ridicule; but upon considering the Nature of the <HI>Bodies</HI> I was about to assault, I was soon convinced that I might as well attempt to penetrate into the Heart of a Butcher's Block with a Razor.—Besides, as those incomparable Masters, whom I have taken for my Pattern; have so well succeeded by the Use of the <HI>Cleaver</HI> alone, it would be very imprudent in me were I to make my first Attempt with any other Weapon.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T seems then, that not one Man can be found among the whole Pr—ry Faction, who will appear openly, and acknowledge himself the Author of the <HI>Answer</HI> to Mr. <HI>F's Remarks,</HI> or even undertake to sup∣port the Facts therein alledged. From the Proofs they had repeatedly given of what, for the Sake of murdering Reputations, they <HI>could do,</HI> it was the general receiv'd Opinion, that there was nothing in their Power, which might have a Chance of contributing to that End, but what some of them <HI>would do.</HI> But we were it seems mistaken, and it is a Piece of Justice due to them that we should confess it to the Pub∣lick. Neither the great <HI>Gyant</HI> himself, nor even any of his Vassals of the Col—ge or Cor—n, are yet so lost to all Sense of Shame as publickly to avow a Performance of so vile and infamous a Nature. It is <HI>extraordinary,</HI> but as it is <HI>true,</HI> they ought to have Credit for so much <HI>unexpected Goodness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010014_0006_0F7B98773387C1D8"/>BUT how has the <HI>Goliath</HI> of the <HI>Philistines</HI> extricated himself from the <HI>Challenge</HI> of little <HI>David?</HI> Alas, in a manner very unbecoming so great a <HI>Gyant!</HI> When neither Threats or Entreaties could prevail on a single Son of Sedi∣tion to stand forth in his Behalf, and front the Danger, he meanly condescends to act the Part of a <HI>Quack-Doctor!</HI></P>
<P>BEHOLD, a <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI> or <HI>Merry-Andrew</HI> is provided! — He mounts the Stage, properly accoutred in his <HI>Mask</HI> and <HI>Fool</HI>'s-<HI>Cap;</HI> jumps—dances—capers—jingles his Bells— laughs—grins—and chatters like a Monkey—<HI>when he has climb'd so high as to show his naked Posteriors:</HI> Sometimes we see him lolling out his Tongue and making game at the gaping Multitude, and sometimes doing the like at the very worthy <HI>Doctor</HI> himself; who, poor Soul, being busily employed in dispensing the <HI>Papers</HI> and <HI>Pacquets</HI> of <HI>poisonous Drugs</HI> which he had <HI>got prepared</HI> for the Purpose, is not the least sensible of the ridiculous Figure he makes.</P>
<P>WITH your Leave, Gentle Reader, we will open one of these <HI>Papers,</HI> examine its Contents, and analyse the Composition.</P>
<P>WE find then, in the first Place, that <Q>Mr. H—s, for very substantial Reasons, is supposed <HI>not</HI> to be the Author of his Challenge.</Q> What those <HI>substantial Reasons</HI> may be, we are, however left to guess till we come to the last Paragraph, where it is intimated, that he is not <Q>capable of writing an Advertisement.</Q> Suppose this to be really the Case (which, by the Bye, no one the least acquainted with Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> will admit) pray, is it the less his Challenge on that Account? Does not his publishing it with his Name affixed, make it as much <HI>his Challenge</HI> as if he penn'd or indited every Syllable? Is not the famous, or rather <HI>infamous,</HI> Protest, considered as the <HI>Protest</HI> of Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> and the other Subscribers, tho' 'tis well known to be drawn up by the <HI>pitiful</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This conceited Coxcomb had the Impertinence, in speaking of Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> in the House, to say that he really "PITIED the <HI>poor Man!</HI>"</NOTE> Mr. <HI>D—n,</HI> revised, corrected and amended by the Rev. <HI>Sentiment-dresser-General</HI> of the
<PB N="11" REF="010014_0006_0F7B98773387C1D8"/>
Pr—ry Party? — And, after all, why is Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> to be supposed <HI>not capable</HI> of writing <HI>an Advertisement?</HI> Surely it cannot be said that any extraordinary Genius or Abilities are necessary for such a Purpose, since we have, in the very News-paper containing Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> Challenge, an Advertisement wrote by Messrs. <HI>Al—n</HI> and <HI>T—er.</HI> These respectable Gentlemen, it seems, being about to leave off their Business of <HI>Boiling</HI> and <HI>Baking,</HI> have advertised for Sale the <HI>Pots, Pans,</HI> and other <HI>Utensils</HI> belonging to their Trade.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As it is become so fashionable with the Pr—ry Faction, to estimate a Man's <HI>present</HI> Fitness for public Affairs, by what may have been his <HI>former</HI> Occupation, I would humbly recommend to those Dablers in Politics, the learned Doctors of the C—ge, to ascertain whether a <HI>Baker</HI> of <HI>Bread</HI> is not as likely to make a good Politician as a <HI>Baker</HI> of <HI>Sugar:</HI> And when their Hands are in, I wish they would likewise settle to which the Preference ought to be given in Point of <HI>"Rank"</HI>—Whether to the Man who furnishes us with a <HI>Necessary of Life,</HI> or he that procures us a <HI>Luxury?</HI> The Case is indeed intricate, and will require a deal of Consideration, but I trust those <HI>Sages</HI> are equal to the Task.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF therefore Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> is really not capable of wording an Advertisement, and is ambitious of acquiring that very profound Knowledge, he has now the happiest Oppor∣tunity that could possibly have offered. Let him resolve but to take Pattern by the learned Messrs. <HI>Al—n</HI> and <HI>Tu—er</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and he will find that he has little more to do than to provide himself with a large Quantity of WITHS to tye his Words and Sentences together: The rest will follow easy enough. For Example, <Q>TO BE SOLD, the Copper Boilers, Copper Coolers and Pans— <HI>with</HI> a large Number of Moulds and Drips—<HI>with</HI> every other Material ready for carrying on the Business;—toge∣ther <HI>with</HI> the Still-House—<HI>with</HI> the Worms and Tubs— <HI>with</HI> a large Shed,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>EVERY Author has his Admirers, and 'tis not impro∣bable but there may be, among Messrs. <HI>Al—n</HI> and <HI>T—r</HI>'s Readers, some who will fancy they see great Beauties in
<PB N="12" REF="010014_0007_0F7B9877F0A4B688"/>
their Performance; nor should it be wondered at, if some Academical Haberdashers of Nouns and Pronouns, should undertake to convince us, that so much Clearness and clas∣sical Elegance of Style, never before entered into a Com∣position of so trivial a Nature.</P>
<P>We are told, among other Things offered by Way of Excuse for the Author of the <HI>Answer</HI> not avowing his Performance, that <Q>the subscribing political Papers has not been a common Practice either here or in the Mother Country, nor would it be a convenient One.</Q> —What the common Practice in the Mother Country may be, with regard to political Papers, I can say nothing of my own Knowledge, as I never was there. But I look upon the Paper in question to be not so much a <HI>political</HI> as a <HI>per∣sonal</HI> Paper: Far the greatest Part of it consists of <HI>personal Reflections</HI> against Mr. <HI>F—n.</HI> Now, I am told by those who have resided in England, that it is very <HI>uncommon</HI> there to attack in Print a Person's <HI>private Character</HI> on account of any Difference in Sentiments about <HI>publick Affairs;</HI> and that <HI>Wilkes</HI> and <HI>Churchill</HI> are almost the only Dealers in that dirty Business who have appeared there for many Years. The first of these we find, has on that Account been outlawed by King, Lords, and Commons; and the second held in Detestation by every good Man throughout the King's Dominions. Nor can I find that the Practice was ever introduced into this Country, till the <HI>very Revd.</HI> Dr. <HI>S—h</HI> made his Appearance, and we all know what great <HI>Veneration</HI> and <HI>Esteem</HI> he has thereby acquired.—It is therefore not to be wondered at, if Persons of their Stamp should not think it <HI>convenient</HI> to be known to the Publick.</P>
<P>But <Q>the Cause of Liberty (we are told) would often be left to suffer, if her Advocates were obliged to expose their Names to the Clamor of Party or the Resentment of Power.</Q> In so glorious a Cause as that of <HI>Liberty,</HI> no Man ought to be afraid to stand forth. Those who have rendered it the greatest Services have ever been such
<PB N="13" REF="010014_0007_0F7B9877F0A4B688"/>
as most openly appeared in its Behalf. But why should our Author, of all Men, be afraid of the <Q><HI>Clamor of Party,</HI></Q> or the <HI>"Resentment of Power,"</HI> since, according to his <HI>own Account,</HI> <Q>five Sixths of the People of this Province who have seen his Answer have decided in its Favour,</Q> and since he is assured of having most of the Officers in the Executive Part of Government on his Side?—For they that hold Commissions must not <HI>dare,</HI> it seems, to act otherwise than as they are directed.</P>
<P>IT is said, however, that <Q>almost all Mr. <HI>F</HI>'s political Pieces have appeared without a Name, such as, his <HI>Preface</HI> to Mr. <HI>G—y</HI>'s Speech, his <HI>Cool Thoughts,</HI> his <HI>Narrative,</HI> his <HI>Historical Review,</HI> and many more, in which he has taken great Freedom with the Characters of others.</Q> But, to have shown that Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>'s Con∣duct was similar to our Author's, he should have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Instance of that Gentleman's having published an <HI>anonymous Answer</HI> to some Piece that had been published with the <HI>Writer's Name</HI> subscribed, and had therein attack∣ed the said Writer's <HI>private Character.</HI> As to the Pieces mentioned, they are very far from proving any Thing to the Point.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Preface</HI> is an anonymous Answer to Parson <HI>Pe—rs</HI>'s, Parson <HI>S—th</HI>'s, Parson <HI>Al—on</HI>'s, and Parson <HI>Ew—n</HI>'s anonymous Preface to what was <HI>called</HI> Mr. <HI>Dic—n</HI>'s Speech. Yet tho' he was greatly reflected upon in their Preface, he has but just named the first as it were, and of the second all that he has said, which is any Ways per∣sonal, is, "<HI>S—h</HI> that <HI>Poisoner</HI> of other Men's Characters." And, when 'tis considered how long Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> had patiently borne with that prostitute Writer's Attack on his Character, it is surprising he let him off so gently. The other two Rev. <HI>Assassins</HI> he has not so much as mentioned in any Thing he has <HI>yet</HI> wrote.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Cool Thoughts</HI> do not contain one single Thing relative to any Man's Character in the Province, but is a mere <HI>Answer</HI> to such <HI>Objections</HI> as had been made against a <HI>Royal Government.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010014_0008_0F7B9878DDDDDBD8"/>HIS <HI>Narrative</HI>—Is that too to be thrown in his Teeth! And can Pr—ry Partisans mention the Word NARRA∣TIVE without Confusion! Does that contain the minutest Reflection on any but those who have fix'd an indelible Stain on their Country, their Religion, on Humanity itself?—the horrid Murderers of innocent Men, Women, and Babes, who were at the very Time under their Protec∣tion! Was it not expressly wrote to spirit up the People to defend the G—r, who was insulted and threatened, and to strengthen the Powers of Government which were despised and trampled upon? Was it not highly approved of by the G—r, Mr. <HI>H—n,</HI> the At—y Gen—I, Mr. <HI>Pe—rs,</HI> and every Pr—ry Minion in the Province? Did not even the haughty Pr—r himself deign to praise it, and commend Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>'s Conduct on the Occasion to his Friends in <HI>England?</HI> Nay, did not the rancorous great <HI>Gyant</HI> for once check the Overflowing of his Gall, and vent a <HI>Grunt</HI> of Approbation? Did not his Letters from England greatly condemn the Conduct of the Rioters and their Abettors? And, after he return'd, did he not daily bellow out in the Coffee-House the Necessity there was, for the Honour of the Province, to bring those Murderers to Justice, till it was hinted to him that he had best be silent or he would endanger his Election? Did not the G—r in a manner throw himself upon Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> and his Friends for Protection; and did not they extricate him from all his Difficulties—<HI>even at the Risque of their Lives?</HI> Did not the G—r acknowledge himself under great Obligations to them on this Account? But — O shameful! —Was there not within two Days after a Union formed with those very Murderers, and their Abettors, against the very Persons who had shown themselves His H—r's Friends in the Time of Danger? And, lastly, was not this very extraordinary Conduct, and the afterwards insisting on the <HI>best</HI> of the Pr—ry's Land being tax'd <HI>no higher</HI> than the <HI>worst</HI> of the People's, the <HI>principal Causes</HI> of a Majority of the Freeholders, and their Representatives, determining on a

<HI>Change of Government?</HI> Let them deny any one of this String of Queries, <HI>if they dare.</HI> Should they be so hardy, another <HI>Narrative</HI> shall appear, that shall probe their Con∣sciences to the very Quick, even though they may be <HI>sear'd with a hot Iron.</HI></P>
<P>THERE remains then on the List, only, "His <HI>Historical Review</HI>" as it is called; but as I am well assured from good Authority, that he did not compile that Work, and as it is little more than a mete Relation of the publick Conduct of the several Branches of our Legislature, there is nothing farther necessary to be said on that Head.—And as to the "many more" of his political Pieces, which our Author has not named, he is defy'd to produce one wherein Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> begun an Attack on any Man's Reputation. If in any <Q>he has taken great Freedom with the Characters of others,</Q> it is only where he has been drove to it <HI>in his own Defence,</HI> and after he had pass'd by so many villainous Aspersions of his Character, as to induce his Calumniators to think they might continue to abuse him with Impunity.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>F—n</HI>'s Friends are next asked, <Q>Why they will insist upon a Practice so different from his own, and even make it a Condition on which alone they will make a <HI>Reply?</HI></Q> They do not, as appears from what is already said, insist upon any Practice <HI>different</HI> from his own; all they ask, and in which every honest Man will think them right, is▪ that his Adversaries will act in the <HI>same</HI> open Manner he has done, and subscribe their Names to their Performance.— Even his <HI>anonymous</HI> Pieces were so far from being disown'd by him, that he always, upon being ask'd, acknowledged he was the Author. But of all the Shoal of anonymous Prop—ry Papers which have appeared during our Contests, there cannot be found a Man that will own one of them; on the contrary, the greatest Care and Pains is taken to conceal the Names of their several Writers.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="010014_0009_0F7B98796EDF9E58"/>FROM whence they have gathered, that Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>'s Friends <Q>make it a <HI>Condition</HI> on which <HI>alone</HI> they will make a <HI>Reply,</HI></Q> I am at a Loss to guess. No Words in Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>'s Advertisement imply any thing of the kind. It is there said, that if they will <HI>avow</HI> their Performance, in <HI>such Case,</HI> there shall be a <HI>Reply</HI> published with the Writer's Name affixed. But surely this is not to be con∣strued to mean that, if they <HI>don't avow</HI> it, there will then be <HI>no</HI> Reply made, either <HI>anonymous</HI> or <HI>otherwise.</HI> If you really, Gentlemen, do imagine that this was the Intention of either Mr. <HI>H—s,</HI> or any other of Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>'s Friends, you flatter yourselves egregiously. They were determined, from the first, to <Q>detect and expose what was false in the Answer to the Remarks,</Q> but then they wanted also to <HI>detect</HI> and <HI>expose</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> of those <HI>Falsities,</HI> and thereby prevent his <HI>imposing</HI> on the Publick in future; which could not be done without he could be made to appear. For this Purpose, and to show his Regard for an absent Friend, Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> published his Challenge; but, to do you Justice, you have had the Address to discover the Plot, and have therefore prudently declined entering the Lists.</P>
<P>SINCE Matters are thus circumstanced, and you are determined, like your Brother Savages of the Ohio, to keep to your <HI>Bush-Fighting,</HI> we must engage you in the <HI>same Manner.</HI> A prudent Officer will always adapt his Operations to the <HI>Nature</HI> of his Enemy, and attack them <HI>in their own Way.</HI>— By this Conduct <HI>Boquet</HI> conquered; by the contrary <HI>Braddock</HI> was defeated.</P>
<P>AS to myself, I am but young and inexperienced in waging <HI>Wordy-War,</HI> this being the first Campaign I ever served; yet have I Spirit enough to attack the great <HI>Giant</HI> himself in his <HI>Castle,</HI> notwithstanding all his <HI>Blunderbusses.</HI> But shou'd I not succeed in my Attempt, there is a hardy Band of Veterans, all sure Marksmen, and long enured to Service, who intend soon to charge their <HI>Rifle-barrel'd Quills,</HI> and make one general Assault on the Giant and all his Adherents. A Body of light Infantry, all Volunteers

of undaunted Courage, have already entered into the Service, and have undertaken to skirmish with the Enemy's Flankers and advanced Guards, and occasionally attack some of their Out-Posts.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, setting aside the "blundering Simplicity" of our Author, who stiles Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> a "<HI>Welsh</HI> Squire," tho' he was born in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> I shall proceed to the next Sentence, which is indeed a curious One. It is there said, that Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> <Q>by calling for a Gentleman of Character to enter the Lists with him, is made to pay himself the Compliment of being a <HI>Gentleman of Charac∣ter,</HI> and to allow Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> to be the same, tho' the Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> had asserted the direct contrary.</Q> On this I would just observe, that if Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> did really call Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> a Gentleman of Character, he then certainly might call himself so, without incurring the Imputation of paying himself a Compliment. But as he really did <HI>not</HI> make use of that Appellation to Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> he stands totally clear of the Charge. His Words are, <Q>if Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> OR any Gentleman of Character.</Q> Here is a very plain Distinction made by him, and it is evident he could not intend to compliment Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> with that Title; for, if he had, he would have said, <Q>or any <HI>other</HI> Gentle∣man of Character, &amp;c.</Q> — The Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> likewise stands as clear of the Charge of having <Q><HI>asserted</HI> that Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> was <HI>not</HI> a Gentleman of Character,</Q> for he has <HI>asserted</HI> no such Thing. It must, however, be allowed, that he pointed out some Parts of Mr. <HI>A—n</HI>'s Conduct which prove he has not always acted up to the Character of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>WE are next told, <Q>that the greatest Part of the Charges in the <HI>Answer</HI> are taken from the <HI>Protest,</HI> which has been signed not only by Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> but nine other Gentlemen of <HI>undisputed</HI> Character, and therefore any further Signing would have been unnecessary.</Q> This also is a gross Misrepresentation; for scarce a Tenth Part of the Charges are taken from the <HI>Protest.</HI> A con∣siderable
<PB N="18" REF="010014_0010_0F7B987C40992320"/>
Number of them were not even then <HI>invented.</HI> Those contained in the <HI>Protest</HI> were fully refuted by the <HI>Remarks,</HI> not only to the Satisfaction of every Man of Candor, but even of some of the <HI>Protesters</HI> themselves. However, I shall leave that Matter to be properly repre∣sented in the <HI>Reply;</HI> and only just remark here, that I cannot see with what Propriety, Men, who have publickly asserted, what some of them knew at the Time to be <HI>absolutely false,</HI> and others of them <HI>knew nothing at all about,</HI> merely to blast the Reputation of a Fellow Citizen who never did one of them the least Injury, can be said to be Gentlemen of <HI>undisputed</HI> Character.</P>
<Q><L>Those Rogues, who understand Things least,</L>
<L>Are still the fiercest in Contest;</L>
<L>Unsight, unseen, espouse a Side</L>
<L>At Random, like a Prince's Bride,</L>
<L>To damn their Souls, and swear and lye for,</L>
<L>And at a Venture live and die for.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Butler.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>I have, however, so much Charity as to believe that several of the <HI>Protesters</HI> are now so ashamed of the scan∣dalous Part they have acted, that they would refuse to do the like again, even tho' directed by Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> and threaten'd with the Loss of their Commissions. It is but Justice too that I should mention my having heard that one of them has declared, "He almost wished his Hand had been cut off before he sign'd the Protest, but that he was prevailed upon to do it against his Judgment."</P>
<P>AND when Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> himself was interrogated concern∣ing the Reason of his Conduct on the Occasion. He an∣swered, that he was hurried into it, having scarce Time to read the Paper over; for that he received it while he was at Dinner at <HI>New Castle,</HI> with a Letter from Philadelphia, purporting, "That if he did not sign it first none of the rest would, and that there would likewise be Danger of some of <HI>their</HI> Country Members not joining them at a future Sessions, unless they could carry down with them some specious Reasons to justify their Conduct to their Constitu∣ents,
<PB N="19" REF="010014_0010_0F7B987C40992320"/>
which Purpose would be best answered by publishing the said Protest with their Names subscribed." But, un∣luckily for the Gentleman's Veracity, it has since come out, that he did read it over several Times, show'd it to Mr. <HI>C—w,</HI> and desired his Opinion of it. Mr. <HI>C—w</HI> read it accordingly, and advised Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> in Words to this Effect: "By no Means put your Name to it —it is a vey foolish Affair —can be of no Service to our Cause —and if you sign it you may depend that Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> will expose you in such a Manner as to make you repent it as long as you live." Sign it, however, he did, and gloried in it till the <HI>Remarks</HI> appeared. When they came out, he was in a terrible Tre∣pidation indeed. "Wha-wha-wha-What▪ (says he to one of his Acquaintance) can make Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> use me in this Manner —He-he-he seems angry! Bla-bla-bla-Bless me, I never dreamt he would have ta-ta-ta-taken it so ill, or I should not have signed it —I don't know that I ever spo-spo-spoke a disrespectful Word of him in my Life —I always thought him a Ma-ma-Man of Integrity and a Ma-ma-Man of Abilities, tho' I did not like his Po-po-po-Politicks."</P>
<P>HOW very little <HI>disrespectful</HI> he has talk'd of Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> let those testify who have had the <HI>Honour</HI> of being in his Company at any Time within the last seven Years. I can call on some of them who can vouch, that he has not only scandalously traduced that Gentleman's Character in Eng∣land and America, but even meanly attempted to blast the Reputation of his <HI>Son,</HI> because the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>himself</HI> dif∣fered in their <HI>Political Sentiments.</HI> Though the Son has neither directly or indirectly interfered in our Disputes since his Return from England, has treated all those of the Pr—ry Party, who have fallen in his Way, with as much Civility as he has done those of the other, yet has this venomous Slanderer continually aspersed his Character, and even had the <HI>Villainy</HI> to accuse him of a Transaction that every Man in the Government where he resides <HI>knows to be totally FALSE.</HI> Not contented, however, with thus vil∣lifying him in private, he has had the Baseness to employ
<PB N="20" REF="010014_0011_0F7B987D0F1E0E60"/>
those Miscreants <HI>S—th, Ew-n</HI> and <HI>D-ve,</HI> to give him a Spattering of their <HI>Hog Wash</HI> in almost all their execrable Performances! — But this is not the only Instance which can be produced of his carrying his Malice and Resentment to the Children of those who have occasionally disobliged him.</P>
<P>THAT he who is so link'd with the Prop—r, and has had, with his Brother-in-law, the almost sole Disposition of Offices in this Province for a considerable Number of Years, should be strenuous in opposing a King's Govern∣ment, is not to be wondered at; nor should we blame him greatly, or any others possess'd of Offices under the Pro—r, for their Struggle on this Occasion, provided they behaved decently; and did not, for the Sake of succeeding in their Schemes, attack the <HI>good Names</HI> of those who are of a different Opinion with themselves. This is what no Men, who deserve good Names, can always have such Command over themselves as not to resent; nor can it be thought to be wrong, by him who has any Feelings, if at some Time or other they take that Revenge which may be in their Power.</P>
<P>AS to Mr. <HI>F—n's</HI> POLITICS, which Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> has such an <HI>Aversion</HI> to, let the Messages on the Minutes of Assembly, and his other political Writings declare. They will there be found to be such as must do him Honour with all Lovers of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> as long as <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> are held in any Repute.</P>
<P>TO proceed, <Q>Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> ('tis said) knew he trod on safe Ground, by calling on Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> particularly in this Affair, as he well knew that Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> would not chuse to enter the Lists with <HI>such</HI> an Antagonist as <HI>had</HI> yet appeared.</Q> But, pray, Mr. Author, who was the Antagonist that Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> knew <HI>had</HI> appeared? How∣ever, as I conceive your Meaning, I shan't differ with you about Words. I should nevertheless, be glad to be informed why Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> is not a proper Antagonist for Mr. <HI>A—n.</HI></P>

<P>Some of our <HI>wiser</HI> and <HI>better</HI> Sort of People, since they have ac∣quired Offices and Property, are very apt to talk of <HI>Family;</HI> tho' the GRAND-DAM of HONOUR to some of our <HI>Honourables</HI> sold <HI>Pins</HI> in a Shed on <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> and their DAM of HONOUR was Daughter to the <HI>Apothecary</HI> in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet:</HI> And tho' the GRAND-DAM of HONOUR to another of our <HI>Honourables,</HI> was a <HI>Fish-Woman</HI> at <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> (from whence the Love of Fish, Oysters, Clams and Bawdry, have descended to her Posterity) and his DAM of HONOUR was a <HI>Wapping</HI> Landlady, who afterwards rose to be a <HI>Huckstering Salt-seller</HI> in <HI>Quilsylvania,</HI> where many now alive remem∣ber to have seen her sitting on a Bushel, in the open Street, <HI>selling Salt.</HI>—But it must, however, be acknowledged, that being ambitious of mending the Breed, he chose for a DAM to <HI>his</HI> BRATS, <HI>Marget</HI> the Daughter of a <HI>Convict</HI> Servant.</P>

Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> will therefore excuse my drawing the Parallel between them in this Instance.</P>
<P>IS it on Account of <HI>Fortune?</HI>— Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> is to be sure, by a lucky Concurrence of Circumstances, by Pr—ry Favour in Land Purchases, by illicit Trade, and by — what may be mentioned another Time, possessed of a large Estate.—As to Mr. <HI>H—s,</HI> his Father left him a handsome Fortune, to which he has made a considerable Addition by his <HI>honest</HI> Industry and good Management. It is true that his Estate is not so great as Mr. <HI>A—n</HI>'s, but it is neverthe∣less such as puts him upon a Footing with any Man in the Province.</P>
<P>IS it on Account of <HI>Rank?</HI>— Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> is a Member of Assembly brought in by <HI>Pr—ry Interest</HI> for an incon∣siderable distant County.— Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> is likewise a Member of Assembly; but brought in, for a Number of Years
<PB N="22" REF="010014_0012_0F7B987D8F1E7FA8"/>
past, by a considerable Majority of the most wealthy and independent Freeholders of the most wealthy County in the Province, without the least Sollicitation on his Part, and without <HI>Bribery, Corruption, Threats, Promises,</HI> or <HI>Per∣jury.</HI> — But is not Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> a <HI>C—f J—ce?</HI> True; but he is a <HI>Pr—ry C—f J—ce,</HI> during <HI>Pr—ry Will and Pleasure;</HI> and holds his Office on <HI>such Terms</HI> as make it much to be doubted, Whether there is more than <HI>one</HI> Man besides in the Province who would accept the Commission if it was vacant.</P>
<P>IS it on Account of <HI>Abilities?</HI>— Some of Mr. <HI>A—n</HI>'s Friends may perhaps say of him, as <HI>Sancho</HI> said of his Master <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> <Q>in <HI>Speeching</HI> and <HI>Understanding</HI> he knows a Point more than the Devil himself.</Q> It must be confessed, that when he shuts his Eyes, strains hard, and makes the Tobacco foam at his Mouth, he does sputter out some very extraordinary Sentiments indeed! But powerful as he is, even those very Friends acknowledge that he was no ways a Match for Mr. <HI>H—s,</HI> in the Debates at the last Sessions; on the contrary, that the latter answer∣ed and refuted every Thing that was advanced by the other, so that he could not succeed in any one Point he undertook to carry for the <HI>Pr—r,</HI> nor even make a single Convert to his Party.— Our Author, therefore, if he had understood his Business, would, instead of <HI>depreciating,</HI> have <HI>magnify'd</HI> Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>'s Abilities, that the <HI>Defeat</HI> his Patron and Em∣ployer suffered might appear the less <HI>disgraceful.</HI></P>
<P>IS it on Account of <HI>Loyalty?</HI>— Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> has ever since he has been in the Assembly, constantly promoted the King's Service, even when Pr—ry Power for Pr—ry Interest has opposed it: He has been generally one of the Commissioners appointed by G—r and Assembly for dis∣posing of the Money granted to the Crown: He has, in order to free us from <HI>Pr—ry</HI> Bondage openly appeared in Behalf of a <HI>Royal</HI> Government: His Majesty's Picture has a Place in his Parlour, and as the old Song has it,
<Q>He drinks the King's Health as oft as he dines.</Q>
<PB N="23" REF="010014_0012_0F7B987D8F1E7FA8" MS="y"/>
But for Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> he has openly opposed a King's Govern∣ment, has in Time of War supply'd the King's Enemies with Military Stores, told us repeatedly, <HI>That we should find the King's little Finger heavier than the Pr—r's whole Loins,</HI> and told us— something still worse of His Majesty, if possible, for which I must beg the Reader's Patience till the <HI>Reply</HI> appears: Instead of the King's Health, <HI>Success to the Minority</HI> (who oppose the King's Measures in Eng∣land) is his standing Toast; and, instead of the King's Picture, he has hung up the Portrait of JOHN WILKES!— the most vile Calumniator of Majesty that has ever yet appeared!—a Man so very abandoned and profligate, that the greatest Part of the very Minority whose Tool he was held him in Abhorrence!</P>
<P>If then Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> has no greater Advantages over Mr. <HI>H—s,</HI> in Point of <HI>Family, Fortune, Rank, Abilities,</HI> and <HI>Loyalty,</HI> than what are mentioned, I should be glad to be informed, on what Account it is that Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> will <Q>not enter the Lists with <HI>such</HI> an Antagonist.</Q> When the true Reason appears, I make no doubt but that it will be found neither more or less than this, That he was afraid of being as shamefully defeated in <HI>Writing</HI> as he had been before in <HI>Speaking.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author next tells us, <Q>that Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> neither was, nor could be <HI>supposed,</HI> the Author of a Performance in which so much is said to his own Advantage, and that his <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Sense</HI> would at least have prevented this.</Q> But as his possessing those two Qualities was not a Matter of <HI>publick Notoriety,</HI> the <HI>Supposition,</HI> if there was any such, is at least excuseable: And what makes it the more so is, that, among the numerous People to whom he harangued by the Hour, there are but few who will not acknowledge that his own Praise was the Subject of a considerable Part of his Discourse. In Truth, however, he was not, nor <HI>could not,</HI> for <HI>"very substantial Reasons"</HI> be supposed the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Remarks:</HI> But as he was <HI>known</HI> to have furnished most of the Materials for the "<HI>Calumny</HI>

Part," and to have sent the Piece when published, to all his Acquaintance abroad, recommending it as a very fine Performance, containing a <HI>just</HI> Account of Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>'s Conduct; it was but reasonable to imagine, that he would be either weak or wicked enough to own himself the Author, or at least undertake to justify the Contents. This too was the rather to be expected, as he had given us a recent Instance of his assuming to himself even what he had <HI>no hand in;</HI> namely, the <HI>Putting off the Stamp-Duty;</HI> as plainly appears by a Letter from Mr. <HI>Huske,</HI> Member of Parliament, which was <HI>signed with his Name,</HI> and <HI>published</HI> in all the News-Papers on the Continent except those of <HI>Quilsylvania;</HI> and why it was not publish'd there needs not to be explained. So far it seems was he from contributing thereto, that it was the <HI>"blundering Simplicity"</HI> of our <HI>Quilsylvanian "Squire,"</HI> which made the Ministry more determined in that Matter than they otherwise would have been. Such a Man as this had needs be, as our Author says, <Q>not so destitute of Friends as to be under a Necessity of advocating his own Cause:</Q> For where a Cause requires such a deal of advocating, it would be a cruel <HI>Necessity</HI> indeed if one so little capable was obliged to perform the Whole. The <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour of cleansing the <HI>Augean</HI> Stable was not an Undertaking of half such Difficulty.</P>
<P>WHEN these same <HI>Friends,</HI> or rather <HI>Creatures,</HI> will accomplish their <HI>Work</HI> 'tis hard to say; for tho' they have been a long while industriously employed in <HI>whitewashing</HI> their Cause; yet they think it still so <HI>very dirty,</HI> that they are asham'd to be <HI>known</HI> to have had any hand in the Busi∣ness.— It is, hovever, a little surprising that notwithstanding they labour so hard for their Employer, he should keep them so scanty both of Victuals and Money as to oblige them to give him such shrewd Hints of their wanting to have a little "Eating in the Case" even tho' it were but a few <HI>"Pies</HI> and <HI>Cakes."</HI> But lest he might suspect they only wanted Money to lay out on <HI>Betty Nic-be-ravished,</HI> a

celebrated Pummel-holder on the <HI>Germantown</HI> Road, they assure him in some very bad Rhime, that
<Q><L>Indeed they "had much rather eat</L>
<L>"Than spend their Money on a BET."</L></Q></P>
<P>—And they might have added, poor Souls! if the learned Doctors of the College had no material Objection to furnishing a good Rhime, and the <HI>pitiful</HI> Master <HI>D—n</HI> would promise not to take Offence;
<Q><L>We "Authors had much rather eat"</L>
<L>Than run the Risque of being <HI>beat.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>IT is diverting to hear one of these "<HI>poor</HI> Authors" (as they justly stile themselves when they speak of their <HI>Authorship</HI>) talk of the Danger of being "frighten'd out "of his WITS," and yet discover to his Readers that he has not even the <HI>Wit</HI> to know the Difference between leaving a Matter to <HI>Arbitration,</HI> and laying a <HI>Wager.</HI> Alas, poor Devil! <HI>even</HI> your Employer has <HI>Wit</HI> enough to know, and could have informed you, that every Man <HI>in his Wits,</HI> who has any Dispute with the Prop—rs about Property, chuses, tho' he may have the Law ever so clear of his Side, rather to leave the Matter to <HI>Arbitration,</HI> where he has "<HI>Half a Chance</HI> of a favourable Decree," than run the Risque of a Decision from a <HI>Pr—ry C—f-J—ce.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the true Reason for this <HI>Jack-Pudding</HI>'s terming Mr. <HI>H—s's</HI> Proposal a <HI>Wager,</HI> was, I imagine, that he might take that Opportunity of sneering at and ridiculing his <HI>Master,</HI> as he had done before in what he said about his "Modesty and Sense." This seems plain from his very Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>I have heard a <HI>noisy Fellow</HI> in a <HI>Coffee House,</HI> after every other Argument failed, offer <HI>(Reason</HI> or <HI>not Reason)</HI> to lay <HI>Two</HI> to <HI>One</HI> he was right.</Q> Now I appeal to every Frequenter of the Coffee-House, and even to those who sit in another House, whether our illustrious Chief has not been more distinguish'd for that Practice than any other Person they know, and whether the Description above quoted is not strictly applicable in all its Parts to his Worship's Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="010014_0014_0F7B987EB7D234F8"/>Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>'s Motives for proposing a <HI>Reference,</HI> were noble, generous, disinterested, and such as must ever do him Honour, with every Man whose good Opinion is valuable. They were to put a Stop to any further Alter∣cation with Regard to the Character of his absent Friend, <Q>and to prevent the Publick from being any longer imposed on by false Representations.</Q> He offered for that Pur∣pose to leave the Points in Dispute to the Decision of Gentlemen from any of the neighbouring Provinces, as they might be supposed the most unbiassed and impartial. And, that the Publick might receive some Benefit in whatever manner the Affair might issue, he further offered to pay <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> to the Provincial Hospital, for every Fact mentioned in the <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Remarks</HI> injurious to Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>'s Character, which should be proved to the Satisfaction of those Gentlemen; provided the opposite Party would pay <HI>Five Pounds</HI> for every Falshood, or gross Misrepresentation their said <HI>Answer</HI> should be proved to contain. This was acting openly, like a Man of Honour engaged in a Cause which his Conscience approved: He had no Inclinations to have his Friend's true Character concealed from the World: He desired, for the Sake of the Publick, that it might undergo a strict Scrutiny, and that if Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> was the wicked Man he had been repre∣sented, he might be recorded as such. This Proposal, however, was not accepted: But every Person must be convinced, that if the Party could have supported one Half of the Charges brought against Mr. <HI>F—n,</HI> they would not have omitted such an Opportunity of destroying his Reputation: For every one, the least conversant with our Affairs, knows that the Ruin of that Gentleman's Character is the grand Point they have in View, as they hope thereby to destroy the Confidence so long placed in him by the Publick— a Confidence that has so greatly contributed to baffle the repeated Attempts to render us Slaves to Pr—ry Will and Pleasure.— If what they have alledged against Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> be <HI>Truths,</HI> they are <HI>Truths of Importance</HI> to this
<PB REF="010014_0014_0F7B987EB7D234F8"/>
Country, especially at this Crisis; and no Man, if he had really the Good of his Country at Heart, would be ashamed or afraid to support them publickly. But how scandalous is the Part the Pr—ry Faction have acted on the Occasion! They even make the very <HI>Equity</HI> of the Proposal a Reason for not agreeing to it; <Q>for (say they) that would be securing Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> HALF A CHANCE of a favourable Decree!</Q>— Now can these Men expect to be deem'd <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> or as having the least <HI>Tincture of Honour,</HI> who will engage in a Cause they think so <HI>very bad,</HI> that they cannot trust it to <HI>impartial</HI> Persons, because there will then be <HI>half a Chance</HI> that it is not decided in their Favour? Nothing less, it seems, will satisfy them than does their Master, the Pr—r, who will not submit any Cause of his to Judges here, unless he can command the Determination of a Majority.— Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> had not any Objection to refer the Matter to Persons chosen in <HI>Quilsyl∣vania,</HI> but he imagined that it would be deemed fairest to leave it to those who might be supposed to be entirely dis∣interested, and unbiassed by Party. If, however, the <HI>Protesters</HI> are willing to leave it to Gentlemen of their own Province, mutually chosen, I dare say, he has not the least Objection, notwithstanding they say, <Q><HI>Five Sixths</HI> of the People of this Province who have seen the Answer to the Remarks <HI>seem</HI> already to have decided in its Favour.</Q></P>
<P>THAT Word <HI>seem</HI> is indeed cautiously chosen, but it cannot with Truth be applied to any but P—ry Minions; "five Sixths" of whom, it must be confessed do <HI>seem,</HI> and <HI>only seem,</HI> to "decide in its Favour"— because they <HI>dare not do otherwise:</HI> But even among them there is not a single Man to be found who thinks so favourably of it, as to <HI>show himself openly</HI> in its Behalf. As to <HI>other</HI> Readers of the <HI>Answer</HI> in this Province, there is not even one in Five hundred but what are so far from <HI>seeming</HI> to approve, that they <HI>publickly</HI> express their Abhorrence of it and its Authors, and think they ought, if possible, to be dragg'd into Light, and exposed to publick Scorn.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="010014_0015_0F7B987FA126ADD8"/>THOSE Words <HI>"Five Sixths"</HI> may likewise serve well enough to amuse the Pr—r who lives at a Distance, and make him believe that tho' they did not succeed in making a Change in the Assembly, (which the Party promised him they would, in order to enable him to carry all his Points, and save him from the Mortification of doing Justice to the People) yet that by their Writings and Influence they had brought over a great Majority of the Inhabitants to their Side. In this Manner they amused the G—r when he was at <HI>N-w-C—le,</HI> during the last Sitting of Assembly. Letters were daily sent him by Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> to let him know that Matters went on swimmingly in the House, that the Pr—ry Party there was encreasing apace, and that he had not the least doubt but he should have every Thing managed agreeable to his Wishes. [For who could withstand the Force of so much Eloquence!] But alas, when Matters came to be put to the Vote, he found that he was not even able to carry a single Point, or to make a single Convert; but on the contrary, some of the very Members whom the Pr—ry Party had got chosen, were ashamed to appear in such a Cause, and therefore joined the other Side. The Figure he made when he appeared before the G—r at <HI>N-w-C—le</HI> with the dismal News of his ill Success, was even more <HI>woeful</HI> than that of the <HI>Knight of the woeful Figure</HI> himself.— In the same ridiculous Light must he appear to the Pr—rs; for they are not quite so devoid of Under∣standing (whatever he may have reason to think of them) as to believe it possible that so great a Majority of the House would have ventured to have chosen Mr. <HI>F—n</HI> to represent the Province in <HI>England,</HI> after so much had been said and done to prevent it, if they were not assured of its being agreable to a great Majority of their Constituents.</P>
<P><Q>MR. <HI>H—s</HI> (proceeds our Author) tells us, or is made to tell us, that he could not <HI>observe</HI> a Ruffian attempting to stab his Friend <HI>in the Dark,</HI> without endeavouring to avert the Blow.</Q> On this I would beg Leave to remark, that tho' it may, perhaps be proper enough for the learned
<PB N="29" REF="010014_0015_0F7B987FA126ADD8"/>
<HI>Owls</HI> of the College to talk of <HI>observing</HI> in the <HI>Dark,</HI> as they have been of late so much employed in Works of <HI>Darkness,</HI> yet as Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> does not pretend to be one of those <HI>favourite Birds of Wisdom,</HI> so neither does he incline to deprive them of the Honour of their own <HI>dark Observa∣tions.</HI> In truth he has not made use of such an Expression: All that he is ambitious of, in conveying his Sentiments, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and speak <HI>plain English,</HI> unornamented even by <HI>Hibernian</HI> Tropes and Figures; notwithstanding what <HI>Butler</HI> alledges,
<Q><L>That he, who is but able to express</L>
<L>No Sense at all in several Languages,</L>
<L>Will pass for learneder, than he, that's known</L>
<L>To speak the strongest Reason in his own.</L></Q>
The Sentence to which the above Quotation from our Author alludes, is this: <Q>But as I am fully persuaded of the Truth of what he [Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>] asserted in the Remarks, <HI>That his Reputation is dearer to him than Life,</HI> I think it would be <HI>as inconsistent</HI> with the Esteem and Friendship I have long professed for him, were I to see his Character so insidiously and infamously attacked, without my appearing in his Behalf, <HI>as it would</HI> be for me to observe a Ruffian attempting to stab him <HI>in the Back,</HI> without my offering to avert the Blow.—</Q> "Now it may be curious to observe, how" our Author, by alter∣ing, transposing, and adding to the Words of the latter Part of this Sentence, without paying any Regard to their Connection with the former Part, has, as he thinks, fur∣nished himself with an Opportunity of displaying an infinite deal of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Humour.</HI> This indeed is no uncommon Practice with Men of heavy Intellects, who having no genuine Wit of their own, are obliged to <HI>study</HI> how to be <HI>witty.</HI> Thus have I observed some of your second Rate Punsters, who not being able to start a Pun off hand on Things as they occur in the Course of Conversation (with∣out which the best is scarcely tolerable) do therefore labour hard to force the Discourse to such Subjects as may pro∣perly
<PB N="30" REF="010014_0016_0F7B988082551F48"/>
introduce the Puns they had previously prepared in their Closets. And thus has our Author managed: Having furnished himself with a Quantity of Stuff which he took to be good sound <HI>Wit,</HI> and being determined to squirt it all at Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>'s Advertisement, he examines that care∣fully over in order to find some Spot proper for its Recep∣tion, but not being able to discover any, he falls immediately to work to make one; just as some <HI>Curs</HI> strive hard to scratch a Hole in which they may discharge their Excre∣ment.</P>
<P>SO much, by Way of <HI>Simile,</HI> in Complaisance to our Author, who seems very fond of the Business of <HI>Simile-making;</HI> and 'tis no Wonder that he should; for he has a most surprizing Skill in adapting them to his Subject. For Instance: After supposing Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> "to call out aloud to a <HI>mask'd Ruffian</HI> (whom he had observed to come <HI>behind</HI> his <HI>Friend</HI> and give him a <HI>sound Drubbing</HI>) that if the Villain would but <HI>show his Face,</HI> or <HI>tell his Name,</HI> he <HI>would grind him to Powder,</HI>" he tells us, that <Q><HI>just so</HI> the re∣nowned Don Quixote, <HI>meeting</HI> a few Merchants, cried out, Let the whole World stand still, and if the whole World will not confess, affirm, and swear, that the Em∣press <HI>Dulcinea</HI> (who by the Bye was only a common Trollop) is the most beautiful Damsel in the World, I challenge you all to Battle.</Q> Now as it may possibly happen, that some of my Readers may be as stupid as I was upon the first Reading of this Passage, and not comprehend the least Resemblance between Don Quixote's <HI>meeting</HI> a <HI>few Merchants</HI> Face to Face, and Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>'s <HI>observing</HI> a <HI>mask'd Ruffian</HI> to come <HI>behind</HI> his <HI>Friend, &amp;c.</HI> I shall endeavour to give them such Lights into this Matter as I have, by Dint of hard Study, or otherwise, been able to procure. I suppose then the <HI>"few Merchants"</HI> are in∣tended to allude to those of that Profession among the <HI>Pro∣testers,</HI> who, it must be acknowledged, did at first <HI>show their Faces,</HI> and <HI>tell their Names;</HI> but, as they afterwards put on their <HI>Visors,</HI> and acted a base, assassinating Part,
<PB N="31" REF="010014_0016_0F7B988082551F48"/>
they then became <HI>mask'd Ruffians,</HI> resembling the one Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> observed to come <HI>behind</HI> his Friend. But what Affinity there is between the DON's challenging the Mer∣chants <HI>to Battle</HI> if they <HI>did not confess</HI> that <HI>Dulcinea</HI> was the most beautiful Damsel in the World, and Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>'s threatning the <HI>mask'd Ruffian</HI> that if he <HI>did confess</HI> his <HI>own Name,</HI> or <HI>shew his Face,</HI> he would <HI>grind him to Powder,</HI> is what I have not yet been able to discover; and I am apprehensive, that if the <HI>"whole World was to stand still"</HI> till Doom's-day in the Afternoon, the <HI>whole World</HI> would not even then comprehend a Whit more of the Matter than myself. — I was also for a long Time puzzled to find the correspondent Part of the Simile belonging to <HI>"common Trollop,"</HI> when luckily for me, a worthy <HI>Friend</HI> suggested that it must certainly be "sound <HI>Drubbing;</HI>" for that our Author having some Time ago taken it into his Head to treat a virtuous young Woman at <HI>Frankford,</HI> as if she had been really a <HI>common Trollop,</HI> she snatch'd up a Broomstick and gave him such a terrible <HI>"sound Drubbing,"</HI> that he has not since been able to separate the Ideas. How this may be, I can't say, but I think the Solution ingenious, and that it has an Air of Probability.</P>
<P>BUT should our Author not have properly fitted the several Parts of his Simile, great Allowance ought to be made for a Man who has been so long <HI>observing</HI> in the <HI>Dark,</HI> that his very Understanding has become <HI>darken'd.</HI> On this Account I can readily excuse his saying, That <Q>as his Quarrel with Mr. <HI>H—s</HI>'s Friend was of a <HI>publick</HI> Nature, he would treat him <HI>accordingly;</HI></Q> which, to be sure, he has <HI>accordingly</HI> done by keeping himself <HI>private.</HI> The same Consideration too prompts me to readily pass over several of his <HI>Grammatical Errors</HI> without Censure, particularly where he tells us, that <Q>if any <HI>Person</HI> of Character who <HI>is</HI> known to be capable of writing an Advertisement, will, to save Trouble, mention what Part of the Answer stands in need of further Proof, THEY will find the Satisfaction THEY desire.</Q> Besides I do
<PB N="32" REF="010014_0017_0F7B9880F0C759B8"/>
not see any Reason why learned Doctors and Professors in a College should be compell'd to the Observance of Gram∣mar Rules: It is sufficient that they <HI>endeavour</HI> to teach them to others. Persons who are really <HI>"capable of writing an Advertisement"</HI> would merit our Censure, perhaps, were they not to write grammatically; but as our learned Doctors and Professors cannot, with any Propriety, be included among those, they are therefore very excuse∣able.</P>
<P>AS I profess myself to be a mere Imitator, I ought, according to the Example of our Author, in the Paragraph before me, give you a long String of <HI>Suppositions</HI> founded upon <HI>false</HI> Representations. But as I have not exhausted a Hundredth Part of the Stock of <HI>Truths</HI> I am possessed of against him and his Employers, I think I may be excused having Recourse to <HI>Falsities</HI> till the said Stock is nearly expended. The following <HI>Suppositions</HI> therefore, must be considered as having Truth for their Basis, and consequently so far deviating from those of our Author. <HI>Suppose</HI> then, that some "dreadful <HI>Giant</HI> or <HI>Knight</HI>" should, partly from the Malice and Envy of his Heart, and partly to oblige his Superior the great HABERDASHER of <HI>Grace-Church-Street,</HI> determine to destroy the <HI>Champion</HI> who guarded the <HI>Golden Fruit,</HI> called <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Privileges,</HI> belonging to the People of <HI>Quilsylvania,</HI> which the said <HI>Haberdasher</HI> wanted to get into his Possession. <HI>Suppose</HI> that the said <HI>Giant</HI> should for this Purpose take to his Assistance eight or nine of the most wicked and obedient of his Vassals and Atten∣dants, and attack the Champion openly in the Highway, hoping that by their united Strength they should totally overpower him. <HI>Suppose,</HI> however, that the Champion should prove too hard for them all, and not only <Q>heartily belabour the <HI>Knight</HI>'s Ribs,</Q> but also give his <HI>Vassals</HI> and <HI>Attendants</HI> a "sound Drubbing." <HI>Suppose</HI> then, that as they were afraid to venture to attack the Champion again, and yet were determined on his Destruction, that the <HI>Haberdasher</HI> might be gratified in his Desires, they should
<PB N="33" REF="010014_0017_0F7B9880F0C759B8"/>
hire a Number of <HI>Bravos</HI> to assassinate him. <HI>Suppose</HI> that those <HI>Bravos</HI> should likewise be afraid to engage the Cham∣pion <HI>face</HI> to <HI>face,</HI> and should therefore take an Opportunity of coming behind his Back, when he was so busily employed as not to have it in his Power to turn upon them again, and then fire upon him from some Bushes where they lay concealed. <HI>Suppose</HI> that a <HI>Friend</HI> of the Champion's, upon hearing the Report of their Guns, should come up to his Assistance; but not being able to discover where the Assas∣sins were hid, should call upon them to come forth, and that he would engage them in Behalf of his Friend. <HI>Suppose</HI> that instead of accepting this Challenge, they should continue in their <HI>Lurking-Places,</HI> and from thence also discharge a Volley at the Person who had acted so bravely and honourably. Must we not then necessarily <HI>suppose</HI> them to be a Set of <HI>mean-spirited, dastardly Wretches,</HI> who ought not only to be expelled the Community, but driven from the Face of the Earth?—"And now (as <HI>Bayes</HI> says in the <HI>Rehearsal</HI>) pray, Mr. Author, what becomes of YOUR <HI>Supposes?</HI>"</P>
<P>HAVING now done with our Author, and as I am not the least desirous of staying longer in his Company than is necessary for his Chastisement, I shall dismiss him with this Advice of <HI>Sancho</HI>'s, viz. <Q>Let every Man take Care how he <HI>speaks</HI> or <HI>writes</HI> of <HI>honest People,</HI> and not set down at a Venture the first Thing that comes into his <HI>Jolterhead.</HI></Q> —But perhaps he may look upon me as an Enemy, and not regard the Council, nor wholesome Cor∣rection, I have bestow'd upon him. Let me therefore recommend to his <HI>worthy Patron,</HI> if he has any Regard for <HI>his own</HI> Credit, to take his "blundering <HI>Squire</HI>" aside, and lecture him as the renowned <HI>Don Quixote</HI> did his <HI>Squire</HI> on a similar Occasion. <Q>Tell me, said the <HI>Knight,</HI> thou modern <HI>Buffoon,</HI> and ancient <HI>Blockhead!</HI> Was it thy Province to <HI>dishonour</HI> and <HI>affront</HI> a Person so <HI>worthy of Reverence and Respect.</HI> For the Love of God, <HI>Sancho,</HI> set a Guard upon thy <HI>Tongue,</HI> and behave so as that the
<PB N="34" REF="010014_0018_0F7B9881AF2ED798"/>
People may not discover by the <HI>Thread,</HI> the <HI>coarse Country Web</HI> of which thou art woven: Consider, <HI>Sinner as thou art,</HI> that the <HI>Master</HI> is respected <HI>in Proportion</HI> to the <HI>Discretion</HI> and <HI>Good-Breeding</HI> of his <HI>Servants;</HI> and <HI>this</HI> is <HI>one</HI> of the <HI>great Advantages</HI> which Noblemen have over People of inferior Rank: Dost thou not consider, thou <HI>Plague to thyself</HI> and <HI>Vexation to me!</HI> that if they perceive <HI>Thee</HI> to be a <HI>base bred Clown</HI> or <HI>blundering Fool,</HI> they will take <HI>me</HI> for some <HI>cheating Impostor</HI> or <HI>Knight of the Post:</HI> No, no, <HI>Sancho,</HI> shun and avoid those Inconveniencies; for, he who sets up for a <HI>Merry-Andrew,</HI> falls at the first Stumble into a <HI>disgraced Buffoon:</HI> Bridle thy <HI>Tongue,</HI> therefore, <HI>consider</HI> and <HI>ruminate</HI> well before the Words issue from thy Mouth.</Q></P>
<P>AND now, tremendous Sir! having thus exhorted your <HI>Squire,</HI> be pleased to accept of a little cordial Admonition for yourself: Part of which shall be another Extract from the History of <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> a Work I am vastly pleased to see quoted by your <HI>Squire,</HI> as it gives me an Opportunity (as I profess <HI>Imitation</HI>) of quoting it likewise. It is indeed a favourite Book with me, and I don't care how often in the Course of our Disputes I may be referred to a Work of such infinite Wit and Humour. It contains besides a vast Fund of serious Instruction, and I heartily advise you to endeavour to deserve the Character which <HI>Sancho</HI> has given of that renowned <HI>Knight;</HI> My <Q>Master (says he) has Nothing at all <HI>mischevious</HI> about him; on the contrary is <HI>as dull as a Beetle,</HI> and knows not what it is to <HI>harm</HI> Man, Woman, or Child, or to <HI>harbour the least Malice,</HI> but <HI>seeks to do good unto all Mankind:</HI> One of the Articles stipulated between us was that I might <HI>talk</HI> as much as I pleased, <HI>provided</HI> it was not <HI>Scandal</HI> against my Neighbour.</Q> —Perhaps, Sir, you may think there will be no great Obstacle to your acquiring the <HI>Beetle</HI> Part of the Character, as Nature has already been so very assistant, and therefore conclude, that it is not worth your while to attempt it, as no <HI>Merit</HI> would result to you should you
<PB N="35" REF="010014_0018_0F7B9881AF2ED798" MS="y"/>
succeed in a Point of so little Difficulty: But then you should likewise consider, that in attempting to deserve the other Parts of the Character, you will then have <HI>Nature</HI> to <HI>combat with;</HI> and, consequently, should Success attend your Endeavours, you will <HI>merit</HI> and <HI>obtain</HI> the Reward of a <HI>good Conscience!</HI> —and the <HI>sincere Applause</HI> of your <HI>Fellow-Citizens!</HI> Rewards (however <HI>light</HI> they may appear in your present Estimation) that would afford you more true heart-feeling Satisfaction, could you but once acquire them, than any you ever yet experienced! — or ever had any Idea of!</P>
<P>IT is, however, but equitable I should mention, that <HI>Sancho</HI> has grossly misrepresented his Master with regard to his <HI>Understanding;</HI> and indeed <HI>Squires</HI> are very apt to talk disrespectfully of their <HI>Knights</HI> behind their Backs, as is well known to be the Practice of the One you at present employ. The <HI>Don</HI> was really a Man of <HI>fine Sense</HI> and <HI>strict Honour,</HI> and, could you but imitate him in these Respects, you would find that whatever Follies and Extravagancies you might at Times commit, would only excite <HI>Laughter,</HI> or <HI>Pity,</HI> instead of that <HI>Ridicule</HI> and <HI>Contempt</HI> you now suffer.</P>
<P>BUT, to be "serious," for the "Subject will admit" of it. —Experience has, I hope, by this Time, taught you the Truth of <HI>Plautus</HI>'s Observation,
<Q><L>Est miserorum, ut malevolentes sint atque invideant bonis;</L>
<L>It is a miserable State to be malevolent and to envy good Men;</L></Q>
Therefore endeavour for the future to expel from your <HI>Heart</HI> the Seeds of <HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Malice,</HI> which produce you such frequent Crops of <HI>Bitterness:</HI> —Learn, if you can, that Golden Rule, <HI>Do unto others as you would they should do unto you:</HI> —Delight not in vilifying the good Name of your Neighbour:— Consider that no Enemy is so despica∣ble but he may if provoked do you an Injury:— Compel your calumniating Scriblers to desist from further Attempts to blast the <HI>Reputation▪</HI> of worthy Men merely because they oppose your Measures, or because they show they have Spirit enough to stand up in Behalf of their own Characters,
<PB N="36" REF="010014_0019_0F7B9882761DB2E0"/>
and those of their absent Friends, when attacked; for, you may depend that you will otherwise raise the Indignation of every honest Man in the Country, as no Man can say (if such Practices are not discouraged) but it may be his Turn next; and you may likewise depend that it cannot answer your Purpose of <HI>silencing</HI> your Opponents, but that, on the contrary, where your Scriblers succeed in <HI>writing one Man down,</HI> they will at least <HI>write Two up:</HI>— Remember <HI>Sancho's</HI> Proverbs, <HI>Like begets Like,</HI> and, <HI>He that plays at Bowls must expect to meet with Rubbers:</HI> Avoid <HI>Politicks</HI> altogether; for most certainly neither God nor Nature ever intended <HI>you</HI> for a <HI>Politician!</HI> No more let loose the <HI>Bloodhounds</HI> of Pr—ry Power to hunt, run down, worry, and tear to Pieces those who dare to oppose Oppres∣sion with Firmness:— Oblige that Pack of <HI>whiffling Curs,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Every <HI>Whiffler</HI> in a laced Coat, who frequents the Coffee-House, shall talk of the <HI>Constitution!</HI>"</P>

<Q><L>A Wit's a Feather, and a <HI>Chief</HI>'s a Rod,</L>
<L>An <HI>honest</HI> Man's the noblest Work of God;</L></Q>
and do not give Occasion for the learned Commentators of succeeding Times to suppose that the <HI>Chief</HI> the Author alluded to, must have been a certain Pr—ry C—f J—ce in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, if Habit has render'd Calumny necessary to your Existence, feed only on those private Family <HI>Peccadillos</HI> which it has been the Business of your Life to procure
<PB N="37" REF="010014_0019_0F7B9882761DB2E0"/>
from the Servants and Slaves throughout the City, and to <HI>dress</HI> up for the Entertainment of yourself and Acquain∣tance. If those are not sufficient to satisfy your and their Appetites, cement more closely the Union you have form'd with your new <HI>Associate</HI> D. J. D-ve: He will not only furnish you with that most agreable of all Foods to your Taste, but after it has found a Passage through your Body, (or <HI>leaky Vessel,</HI> as your Party calls it) he will greedily devour it, and, as soon as it is well digested, he will void it up for a Repast to the Pr—ry Faction: They will as eagerly swallow it as the other had done before, and, when it has gone through their several Concoctions, they will discharge it in your Presence, that you may once more regale on it, thus refined. — "Just so" (now for another Simile) acted the Man who kept a Number of Hogs: After he had dined plentifully, and Nature was ready to perform her Functions, he tied the Head of each of his Hogs to the Tail of another, except the foremost, an old Boar, which he tied to his own Tail: Matters being thus prepared, he fed the Boar with excrementitious Aliment, which, in due Time, pass'd through him, and so through them all, till at length it became again fitted for their <HI>Owner's Stomach.</HI></P>
<P>BEING now about to conclude, I must therefore give you a <HI>"Sketch"</HI> of the Character of the Hero of this Performance in Verse, extracted from some modern Author, in <HI>Imitation</HI> of my Masters in the Art of Scurrility, who attempted the same in the Conclusion of their <HI>Answer</HI> to Mr. <HI>F—n</HI>'s <HI>Remarks.</HI> But "that he may not call it either <HI>"maiming</HI> or <HI>murdering,</HI> I shall give it in the <HI>Drawing"</HI> of <HI>D—d J—s D-ve,</HI> to whom he sat for the Purpose, and to whom he gave a handsome Reward for the great Skill he had shewn in giving the Picture so strong a Resemblance to the Original.
