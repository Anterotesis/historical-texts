<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ACTS XXI. 13.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep, and to break my heart? for</HI> I AM READY <HI>not to be bound only, but also</HI> TO DIE <HI>at Jerusalem for the Name of the Lord Jesus.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE are the words of the Apostle <HI>Paul;</HI> the occasion of them was this: The Prophet <HI>Agabus</HI> had foretold that the Jews would bind him at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and deliver him to the Gentiles, which mov'd his friends to beseech him with tears not to go up. And we see here that this generous Person, who cou'd say of his own sufferings, <HI>None of these things move me,</HI> was scarce able to bear the Sym∣pathy of his friends; however, he rebukes them for urging him to spare himself: <HI>What mean ye to weep, and break my heart:</HI> — And with great firmness of Mind declares his Resolution to com∣ply with GOD's Will, whatever befell him.
<PB N="2" REF="002956_0004_0FE6A58751D4AAB0"/><HI>I am ready</HI> — upon which they also submit to the Will of GOD, 14. <HI>v.</HI> And when he would not be perswaded, we ceased, saying, <HI>the Will of the Lord be done.</HI> A most suitable Expression to flow from hearty Submission under the most dark Providences; for GOD is infinitely holy, just and good, and works all things according to the Coun∣sel of His own Will, in unerring Wisdom and spotless Holiness. Woe to him that strives with his Maker; but happy is he that resigns to him, saying, <HI>Let him doe what seemeth good unto him,</HI> and shall in the Conclusion find, that all GOD's Providences <HI>work together for his good.</HI> Let the same mind then be in us which was also in Christ Jesus, Mat. 26.39. <HI>O my Father — Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> But to return, The Words of my Text express the Apostles readiness to die, yea to suffer Martyrdom for the Name of Jesus. <HI>I am ready</HI> — <Q>I have my self in a Readiness as Souldiers for an Engagement.</Q>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">† Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> Which Heroick Example teacheth us that we should be ready to obey GOD at what time, or in what manner soever He shall <HI>Call</HI> us out of the World. And we have also the Command of our Lord and Saviour for this, who when He had pro∣phesied of the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in which vast numbers of the Jews perish'd, and of the last Judgment as is suppos'd, which will find us in the condition Death leaves us; said, Mat. 24.44. <HI>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as you think not, the son of man cometh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002956_0005_0FE6A5436ADE80A8"/>
Let us then Attend to this DOCTRINE.</P>
<P><HI>It is our Duty to Prepare, and to be always in a Readiness to Die.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are such Duties as these following, to be discharged by us, if we would be Ready to Die.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We must use the Means GOD affords us to make Ready for Death.</HI></P>
<P>GOD in His Word, threatned, <HI>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die,</HI> Gen. 2.17. and assureth us that it is <HI>appointed unto man once to die, and after that the Judgment,</HI> Heb. 9.27. Yea, that Man who is born of a Woman, is <HI>of few days,</HI> Job 14.1. We must then <HI>look into the Scriptures,</HI> and learn from them the procuring cause, the certainty, and consequence of Death. This plain truth must be receiv'd upon the Testi∣mony of GOD's Word, even when we do not feel the approaches of Death. And then, We must heedfully and religiously <HI>observe the Provi∣dences of GOD,</HI> which are a lively Comment up∣on His Word, and cry in our Ears, <HI>All Flesh is Grass</HI>—. Our Daily Experience must be im∣prov'd to Excite us to be also ready. When we see others taken away, and some very Suddenly, we should regard the operation of GOD's Hand, and receive Instruction. Again, We should be much in serious and <HI>close Meditation</HI> on this important Subject. We should consider the shortness of Life, the certainty of Death, the great uncertainty of the time when we must die,
<PB N="4" REF="002956_0006_0FE6A58B86330170"/>and the great Change Death will make upon us, when we must bid an eternal farewell to the business and enjoyments of this Life, yea to the means of Grace we now enjoy; and lanch forth into an amazing Eternity, to be fixt forever in perfect Happiness, or extreme Misery. And here, We must take pains to bring our Minds to a close Application to these truths, which are irksome to flesh and blood, and endeavour to muse till the fire burn, and our Hearts are suitably affected. Furthermore, under a deep sense of our inability, as of our selves, to improve the Means; we shou'd <HI>Ask of GOD His Holy Spirit</HI> to bless them to us, and <HI>Pray,</HI> as Psal. 39.4. <HI>Lord, make me to know mine End.</HI> And 90. 12. <HI>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our bearts unto wisdom.</HI> For unless we obtain this Divine Teaching, tho' the Deaths of others, especially when very sud∣den, may startle us, yet the impression will wear off without any saving effect. GOD may call once, yea twice, but we shall not hear &amp; answer his just expectation. Prov. 1.24. <HI>I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WE must seek after a saving Conversion to GOD, and not be at rest till we have closed with the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as offered to us in the Gospel.</HI> We must be brought out of a state of Nature, into a state of Grace, by the Al∣mighty Power of GOD, or we are not so much as habitually prepared for Death. We were all by Nature, and as Children of the first Adam,
<PB N="5" REF="002956_0007_0FE6A5459A455398"/><HI>Dead in trespasses in sins, and Children of Wrath.</HI> The <HI>Wages of Sin is Death,</HI> not only tempo∣ral but eternal Death. If we are therefore found under the guilt and dominion of Sin, when <HI>Death</HI> overtakes us, <HI>Hell</HI> follows. Certainly then, it most nearly concerns us to labour after a saving Conversion to GOD, and vital Union with our Lord Jesus Christ, in order to our being in a readi∣ness for Death. We must be born again, born from above, of the Spirit of GOD, or we cant en∣ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and therefore are not fit to die. There must be a saving change wrought on all the powers of our Souls; we must be turned from all Sin, unto GOD, or this great change will find us unprepar'd. We must by the Grace of GOD obey that word, Act. 3.19. <HI>Re∣pent and be Converted</HI> —. Unless we heartily grieve and mourn for our Sins as they are against GOD, turn from them with Godly Sorrow and Hatred, and return to GOD as our highest end and chief good; the valley of Death will lead to that place where is weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth for ever. We must also obey that Word of Christ, Joh. 14.1. — <HI>Ye believe in God, believe also in me:</HI> For unless we receive the Record GOD hath given of His Son in the Gospel, and "Rest upon Him alone for Salvation" with that Faith which also purifieth the heart, and works by love; the second Death will come after the first: we shall die in our Sins, and perish for ever. Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life: but the wrath of
<PB N="6" REF="002956_0008_0FE6A58B9E9DC8A8"/>God abideth on on him.</HI> And 11.25. <HI>Jesus said unto her, I am the Resurrection and the Life: be that believe thin me, though be were dead, yet shall be live.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We must labour diligently in finishing the Work GOD hath given us to do in this present Life.</HI> We have a Race to run, a Service to per∣form, before we accomplish as an hireling our day. There is the business of our General Cal∣ling, which must be engaged in and prosecuted with persevering diligence: We must work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling. <HI>For it is God which worketh in us, both to will and to do of his good pleasure,</HI> Phil. 2.12, 13. And there is the business of our Particular Calling, which must be attended in subordination to the other. And if we wou'd be ready, we must be <HI>not sloth∣ful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,</HI> Rom. 12.11. The slothful and unprofitable Ser∣vant, that hides his Lords Talents, may well be afraid of His coming to reckon with him. We must therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good and faithful Servants, im∣prove our Talents, and all our Advantages to the honour of GOD. Now these are various; there are the Powers of Soul and Body, Gifts &amp; Graces, Estate, Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And all must be diligently employ'd, that our Lord when He cometh may find us about His work, and so in a meetness, thro Grace, to enter into our Master's joy. Our Lord Himself said, <HI>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work,</HI> Joh. 9.4. And when about
<PB N="7" REF="002956_0009_0FE6A545B46F2FF0"/>to leave the World, he could appeal to his Father, and say, <HI>I have glorified thee on earth: I have fi∣nished the work thou gavest me to do,</HI> Joh. 17.4. And we must be followers of Him in our dili∣gent Care to glorifie GOD, by doing His Will on Earth, if we would be Ready for our departure. Indeed after all, we must confess we are unpro∣fitable Servants, yea that we have fallen short of our duty, and accordingly depend on the perfect and meritorious obedience of Christ for Pardon and acceptance with GOD. However, we must by a patient continuance in well-doing seek for Glory —. When we are wearied with constant labour in our Lord's Service, tho' not weary of it, we shall think with pleasure of the Rest which remains to the people of GOD in Heaven, and not need to be surpris'd when GOD calls us to give up our Account. Let us then obey that word, Eccl. 9.10. <HI>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest.</HI> O Christian! do you not yet stand compleat, as to your profeised subjection to Christ. <HI>Have you not shewn forth the Lords Death at his Table,</HI> and openly Seal'd the Co∣venant in obedience to that Command, <HI>Do this in Remembrance of Me.</HI> Or make haste to keep this Commandment, lest the reflection on so great an Omission make your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bed very uneasy to you. Have you signal advantages of serving GOD and your Generation; improve them with∣out delay. Are there any any <HI>Relative Duties</HI> you live in the neglect of, O repent and discharge
<PB N="8" REF="002956_0010_0FE6A58DA1554B70"/>them instantly. Have you greatly <HI>wronged</HI> your <HI>Neighbour</HI> by your ill carriage, by unfaithfulness and dishonesty; O seek to give him proper Sa∣tisfaction, make Restitution. Are there <HI>unhappy Differences</HI> where relative bonds oblige to especial Love and Endearment: seek to get them re∣moved, that you may die in love and peace Are there any <HI>Instructions</HI> or <HI>Warnings</HI> needful for your Children &amp; Servants, O delay them not. In a word, do your best that your Work may be done, and well done, that when Death comes you may have nothing to doe but to Die.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Live in the diligent Mortification of Sin, and groan daily for perfect deliverance from it.</HI> Sin is the Sting of Death, and the remains of it in GOD's own Children, are the cause of their inordinate fear of Death; this causeth the <HI>Na∣tural Reluctance</HI> there is in us to a dissolution to degenerate into a <HI>Criminal backwardness</HI> and un∣willingness to answer GOD, when He calls us out of this World. Here then, we must seek the destruction of our Lusts, die to Sin, and so pre∣pare for Death. We must wage an holy war with Sin, with our most beloved Lusts, cutting off the right hand, and plucking out the right eye. Col. 3.5. <HI>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupicence, and co∣vetousness, which is idolatry.</HI> For this end we must improve the Death of Christ. By Faith we must realize it that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, and lay<PB N="9" REF="002956_0011_0FE6A54E80416248"/>aside the sin which most easily besets us, by look∣ing unto Jesus. For this end we should walk in the Spirit, cherish its motions and follow his directions, who is the chief efficient in this work. Rom. 8.13. <HI>For if ye live after the flesh ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body ye shall live.</HI> In a word, the remains of sin in us should be our heavy burden under which we should groan for deliverence. Our Cry should be that, Rom. 7.24. <HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> Such a frame as this maintained in the Soul, would be an excellent means of re∣conciling us to Death; for at Death, and not till then, shall GOD's People be deliver'd from this worst of evils. Then their Warfare is accom∣plish'd, and they are presented faultless before GOD.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We must endeavour more and more to sit loose from this World, and to get our Hearts wean∣ed from Earthly Enjoyments.</HI> If we would be ready to Die, and leave this World, we must <HI>not be conform'd to it, Rom.</HI> 12.2. There are the Men, and Things of this World; there are its corrupt Customs, Fashions and Practices, from which we must separate. Our Saviour <HI>gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil World,</HI> Gal. 1.4. And we must improve the bitter Death and Sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ to crucifie our inordinate Af∣fections to it. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.14. <HI>By whom,</HI> i. e, a Cruci∣fied Saviour; or <HI>whereby,</HI> i. e. the Cross of Christ,
<PB N="10" REF="002956_0012_0FE6A58DB9CAC4F0"/><HI>the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World.</HI> This World contains those objects which Satan makes use of to draw forth the lusts of Men. <HI>The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the World,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.16. Now if we <HI>love the World,</HI> and the things of the World as our Portion, the <HI>love of the Father</HI> is not in us; and we are not prepared to leave it: We must then take care we do not walk according to the Course of this World, but Renounce it. We must rejoyce even in the lawful Enjoyments of this Life, as if we rejoyced not, and use this World as not abusing it, for the fashion of this World passeth away. We must not look upon this as our Resting Place, but confess <HI>we are strangers and pilgrims on the Earth,</HI> Heb. 11.13. We must behave our selves as those that are called out of this World, and do not depend on these things for our happiness. We should look upon this Life to be as a short passage to an endless Eternity, and sit loose from these things, that we may be ready to remove at short warning. And tho' it be true, we have here valuable Enjoyments, which we ought to acknowledge, to the honour of GOD who gives us these things richly to enjoy; yet we must realize it, that they are all <HI>uncertain,</HI> and not the good Part which can't be taken away; and accordingly we should maintain some kind of holy indifferency towards them, and in the tem∣per of our Minds a readiness to leave them. To be sure then we should not with Covetuous desires pursue the Riches, or other Enjoyments
<PB N="11" REF="002956_0013_0FE6A54E9AB766B8"/>of this World, and weary our selves for these Va∣nities; but rather moderate our desires towards these things, and be contented with GOD's allot∣ment; <HI>for we brought nothing into this World, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.7, 8. Moreover, we should manage our Worldly business with a great deal of Resig∣nation to the Will of GOD, and learn to say, <HI>If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that,</HI> James 4.15. When Mens heads are full of wordly projections, and their hearts are deeply rooted in the Earth, they must be as it were torn away from it by violence; but when their hearts are already weaned and taken off from worldly things, they will be in a good measure prepared to leave them, and go to GOD. But <HI>O how much do we need the especial Influences of GOD's Grace that it may be so!</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>We must live in the Exercise of Faith on in∣visible Realities, and set our Affections more on things above.</HI> There's a variety of Graces to be Exercised while attending this Duty; as a lively <HI>Hope</HI> of the Glory to be revealed to GOD's People: an holy <HI>Fear</HI> of the Judgments of GOD, which should Excite us to give diligence that we may be found of our Judge in Peace. But I shall especially instance in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> the vigorous Exercise of which upon proper objects is an excellent preparative for Death. Man is an empty Creature, and hath an inextingushable Thirst after happiness: and therefore while he is sitting loose from this World, he must look at heavenly things, and live by the Faith of the
<PB N="12" REF="002956_0014_0FE6A594A2BE64D8"/>Son of GOD. The World we pass into at Death is the <HI>Invisible World.</HI> We have no knowledge of it, but by Revelation from GOD, and there must be Faith to receive the Testimony of GOD so as to lean the weight of our Souls upon his un∣changible Truth, Faithfulness &amp; Goodness. We must have an intire dependance on that GOD who is the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. There must be Faith in exercise that we may commend our departing Spirits into the hands of GOD the Father, as our reconciled Father in Christ; Faith, to Commit our Souls into the hands of GOD the Son as our Redeemer.
<NOTE PLACE="foot">† <HI>See Dr.</HI> Owen, <HI>of dying daily, p.</HI> 182.</NOTE> And to trust in the Spirit of GOD to put the finishing hand to his work of Grace in us, that <Q>being made perfect in holiness we may pass into that Glory</Q> where nothing enters that defileth. There must be Faith to realize it, that our depart∣ed Spirits should be received to the Paradise of GOD, that when we are <HI>absent from the body,</HI> we shall be <HI>present with the Lord,</HI> and that being joyn'd with the Spirits of just men made perfect. We shall act and enjoy after a better manner then we can in this frail State. We must by Faith receive the <HI>Doctrine of the Resurrection</HI> as a certain truth; that the GOD of <HI>Abraham</HI> will raise his People to a Glorious and Blessed Immor∣tality; yea that when GOD our Saviour appears, <HI>He will change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself,</HI> Phil. 3.21. There is the
<PB N="13" REF="002956_0015_0FE6A54FEF010520"/>nearest Union between Soul and Body, and these most intimate companions cant part comfortably, unless we have a good assurance of their meeting again, to their great advantage. Again, There must be Faith in exercise to <HI>realize the fullness of joys,</HI> which GOD's people shall have with the Lord, in Heaven, where there will be the highest Employments for GOD, and the full Enjoyment of Him to all Eternity; yea, and the communion of the Saints in full perfection, as well as the happy Society of Blessed Angels. <HI>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,</HI> Heb 11.1. And we must live by it, looking not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; <HI>but the things which are not seen, are eternal.</HI> The <HI>ancient Worthies</HI> celebrated in the <HI>11th.</HI> to the <HI>Heb. Died in Faith,</HI> 13. <HI>v.</HI> And then your Faith must work by <HI>Love,</HI> Col. 3.2. <HI>Set your affections in things above, not on things on the earth.</HI> We must re∣turn to GOD as to the <HI>Rest</HI> of our Souls, and seek after intimate communion with him. <HI>Thirst for GOD,</HI> and say as, Psal. 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</HI> We should account the <HI>Son of GOD,</HI> who is GOD <HI>manifest in the Flesh,</HI> to be more <HI>excellent then ten thousands, and altogether lovely,</HI> and labour to come to this, to be willing to part with all that is dear to us in this World, when he shall call; that we may go to be with him, to behold his Glory in Heaven. Phil. 1.23. — <HI>Having a desire to depart, and
<PB N="14" REF="002956_0016_0FE6A594B9D07210"/>to be with Christ; which is far better:</HI> Such an heavenly frame as this, would enable us in a good measure to be willing to Die. <HI>Lord, increase our Faith!</HI> Our Souls cleave to the dust, <HI>O quicken and raise them up to Divine Things!</HI> Let our Conversation <HI>now</HI> be in Heaven!</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>We must seek after the Assurance of our In∣terest in CHRIST, and endeavour to keep our Evidence for Heaven clear.</HI> A Child of GOD may walk in darkness, and when GOD hides his face, no wonder if he is troubled, and the thoughts of Death terrify him. We should therefore give diligence to <HI>make our Calling,</HI> and so <HI>our Election sure,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. Our <HI>Election</HI> evident and certain <HI>to us</HI> by our effectual <HI>Calling;</HI> for <HI>whom GOD did Predestinate,</HI> He also <HI>Calls</HI> in time. All that believe, were ordained to eternal Life, and shall receive the end of their Faith, the Sal∣vation of their Souls GOD's People should then examine themselves, and <HI>try their Faith;</HI> Looking to GOD to shine upon His own Work in their Souls, <HI>and to give them his Spirit to wit∣ness with their Spirits, that they are the Children of GOD:</HI> And take heed they do not grieve the Spirit of GOD, whereby they are sealed to the day of Redemption, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.30. The <HI>joys of the Holy Ghost</HI> are the <HI>earnest</HI> and first fruits of the <HI>heavenly Canaan,</HI> and we should seek after them, that we may long for the <HI>full Harvest</HI> in Heaven. And be able to say, when resigning our Spirits at Death, 2 Tim. 1.12. — <HI>I know whom I have believed</HI> —.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="15" REF="002956_0017_0FE6A5500FB42828"/>
8. <HI>We must Wait and Watch for the Coming of our Lord.</HI> We should have our loins girded a∣bout, and lights burning, like unto them that wait for their Lord, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.35, 36. Expecting that He will come, and submissively waiting that we may answer when He Calls, and yield a ready Obedience. <HI>Job</HI> says, 14 14. <HI>If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come.</HI> Some under∣stand this change of <HI>Death;</HI> others of the <HI>Resur∣rection:</HI> Take it in the former sense, and then the next words, <HI>v.</HI> 15. intend that he would be in a readiness to answer and obey the sum∣mons, when GOD should call him out of this World. And while we are dutifully waiting our Lord's time, we must also <HI>Watch,</HI> by taking care to preserve a wakeful frame of Spirit. Mark 13.35—38. <HI>Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the Master of the house cometh; at even∣ing, or at midnight, — or in the morning, Lest coming suddenly, be find you sleeping.</HI> The Chil∣dren of GOD themselves should take heed, and beware of a drowzy frame of Spirit. Even the <HI>wise Virgins slumbred &amp; slept,</HI> Mat. 25.5. What need is there then that we gird up the loins of our minds; that we govern our sensitive appe∣tites, and beware lest our hearts being over∣charged with sensual pleasures, worldly cares or the like, we be heavy to sleep. Luke 21.34. <HI>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfetting &amp; drunken∣ness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</HI> We must take this care that
<PB N="16" REF="002956_0018_0FE6A598E8BD65C8"/>we be not <HI>surprized</HI> when our Lord shall come to call us hence by Death, no not, tho' his coming should be sudden, and the particular war∣ning given, very short: And therefore we ought to live every day, as not knowing but it may be our last; for we know not what a day may bring forth. But O how much easier is it to lay down Rules for our Preparing for Death, than it is duly to practise according to them; <HI>The LORD teach us the Divine skill of being always Ready to Die.</HI></P>
<P>I. might have considered the <HI>Obligations</HI> we are under to this important Duty; but I shall only say, That the right discharge of it, is most needful and useful in order to our <HI>Living to the Glory of GOD in this World,</HI> and <HI>to our prepa∣ring for the enjoyment of Him in the World to come.</HI> So that we must attend this Duty, or fall short of the Glory of GOD, miss of the chief End of our being, and live in vain.</P>
<P>USE, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>How great, and how much to be la∣mented is the Stupidity of the greater part of Man∣kind in this matter!</HI> That they are so thôtless about this great change of Death, so regardless of the consequences, and so very negligent in mak∣ing ready for it. The Providence of GOD makes this truth, <HI>Thou shalt surely Die,</HI> as plain and familiar almost as can be. Daily experience teacheth it: Yea, so wise are Men for this World, that they will scarce trust their Neighbour's life for a day, without taking some security of him, when any temporal Interest depends upon it:
<PB N="17" REF="002956_0019_0FE6A559AF8730C8"/>while at the same time they run all hazzards te∣specting their precious Souls, and walk at all adventures respecting their future State; pursuing this pasting World as their Portion. Psal 49.11 — 14. <HI>Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling∣places to all generations; — This their way is their folly; — Lake sheep they are laid in the grave</HI> —. Who regard not tho' one after another they are led to the slaughter. Thus Man is be∣come like the beasts that perish. O dreadful Stupidity! Practical Atheism! He knows bet∣ter, would he consider and shew himself a Man. Madness is in their heart while they live, and af∣ter that they go to the dead, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.3. Yet, alas! the best of us have great reason to bewail the remains of this evil Disposition in us: How foolish are we, and slow of heart to believe?</P>
<P>USE, II. <HI>Let us seriously Inquire, Whether we have set about this great Duty of Preparing for Death.</HI> Have we laid this to heart, That we must Die, and considered what is like to become of us after Death? Have we been quicken'd from a Realizing view of our Mortality to secure the favour of the Eternal GOD, and to make haste unto CHRIST in whom all GOD's People are made alive? Do we Watch for our Lords coming, and give diligence that we may be found of our Judge in Peace? In what condition should we be, if GOD shou'd now call us out of the World? Are we in some measure pre∣pared to attend that Work which can be done but
<PB N="18" REF="002956_0020_0FE6A5990612A830"/>once, and upon which, ETERNITY depends? Surely we should not be easy, till we get these Inquiries well resolved.</P>
<P>USE, III. Let us hear and obey the call our Lord gives us in His Word, and by His Provi∣dence, <HI>Be ye Ready also.</HI> We might have been a Warning to Others, who are gone to the Place of Silence; but the Lord of Life hath made them a Warning to us, and calls aloud to us; Particu∣larly, in the <HI>very Sudden Deaths</HI> of the last Week, to be Preparing for our own. Let us then to Day, Hear His Voice, and not harden our hearts, <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.7, 8. The distinguishing goodness of GOD to us should affect us, and lead us to Re∣pentance. Let us hear that Voice of the Lord, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.2, 3. Jesus said unto them, <HI>Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Ga∣lileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI> Hear ye then; <HI>Give Glory to the LORD your GOD before be cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness,</HI> Jer. 13.15, 16. GOD speaks to Old and Young, to the middle Aged, and the blooming Youth, to Consider, and Obey His Voice. However I wou'd in an espe∣cial manner direct the <HI>Exhortation</HI> where Provi∣dence seems to point it, <HI>To our Young People, and those that are in their full Strength, Prepare to follow.</HI> You may be tempted to put away the the evil Day, and to say, <HI>Soul, take thine ease,</HI> — To morrow shall be as this day; because
<PB N="19" REF="002956_0021_0FE6A559CAE3B458"/>your Constitution is unbroken, and you feel no symptoms of an approaching Dissolution. But let the Word and Providence of GOD repell this temptation which hath destroyed it's ten thousands. It's no strange thing for Persons to die in Youth: Yea, sometimes that cry is heard in a very sud∣den and surprising manner, <HI>The young Men are Dead,</HI> Job 1.19. Your Sun may set ere it be Noon, and the shadows of the Evening cover you before you reach the middle Age of Life. And will you run the dreadful hazard of eternal torments for the short uncertain pleasures of sin. O do it not! Eccl. 11.9. <HI>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> It is appointed unto you once to die, and after this the Judgment. Surely then you should now <HI>give glory to GOD in whose hands your breath is;</HI> you should now acquaint yourselves with him, you should now in the Morning begin to work out your Salvation, beseeching GOD to work in you to will and to do. <HI>O Young People,</HI> you are our <HI>Hopes</HI> and our <HI>Fears.</HI> The time of Youth hath been the day of Salvation to many, yea it is likely to most that have been Converted: And yet, there is great reason to be afraid of you, and jealous over you with a Godly jealousy. Such is the corruption of your Hearts, such the snares laid for you by Satan, and an evil World. Be perswaded then to make haste to your Al∣mighty and Compassionate Saviour, who said to
<PB N="20" REF="002956_0022_0FE6A5A0AB699A08"/>his Ancient covenant People, <HI>O Jerusalem, Jeru∣salem, how often would I have gathered thy child∣ren together even as a hen gethereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?</HI> Matt. 23.37. O let it not be said of you, you will not come to Him! but now fly to Him that you may find rest and protection under the shadow of His Wings, who is able to save to the uttermost. Heavenly Father make them willing in the day of thy power! Don't bid me go away for this time; for this is the fittest time, and it may be the only time ever you shall have. Now it may be, your Consciences are awakned, and the Spirit is striving with you. O don't resist Him; but cry to GOD now to turn you, that you may be turned; for He is your Covenant GOD. Now <HI>seek Christ early,</HI> earnestly, and <HI>you shall find him.</HI> But if you reject Him, and neglect His great Sal∣vation, it may be He who <HI>hath the Keys of hell and of death,</HI> will say to you, <HI>Thou fool! this Night thy Soul shall be required of thee.</HI> Whereas if you now hear and obey, your Souls shall live. I close this particular Exhortation, with those words, Prov. 1.23. <HI>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</HI></P>
<P>To inforce the general Exhortation, and further press it upon all of us, I wou'd say by way of <HI>Motive,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Your Life is Short and very Uncertain.</HI> What is your Life? it is even a Vapour that ap∣peareth for a little time, &amp; then vanisheth away,
<PB N="21" REF="002956_0023_0FE6A55B32B4A6E0"/><HI>James</HI> 4.14. You know not how soon, how suddenly your Lord may call. The living know that they shall die; but the day of Death and Judgment are a great secret: and why so? That we may be always ready.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Your Doom will be very dreadful if you are found unprepared at Death.</HI> GOD's own Children may be under darkness in that hour, for want of actual preparedness; But if you have taken no care to make ready, your surprise and terror will be inconceivable when Death shall seise upon you, and your despised Saviour shall stand afar oft from your help; yea, shall enter into Judgment with you, and send you to the Spirits in Prison to be reserved to the Judgment of the Great Day. Matt. 24.48. — 51. <HI>But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: The Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not ware of; And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>But if you make Ready, the day of your Death shall be better to you, then the day of your Birth.</HI> GOD will stand by you in the hour of Death, and will receive your Spirits, when the vital union between Soul and Body is dissolv'd, into the Arms of his Eternal Love and Mercy;
<PB N="22" REF="002956_0024_0FE6A5A0C6F8BAA0"/>the holy Angels shall guard your departed Spirits to the heavenly Paradise: And while your flesh rests in hope, your Souls shall wait in a joyful Expectation of the Redemption of your Bodies at the Great Day. Matt. 24.46, 47. <HI>Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh, shall find so doing Verily, I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</HI></P>
<P>USE, IV. <HI>Let this then comfort GOD</HI>'s <HI>People who are making ready for their LORD</HI>'s <HI>coming at Death.</HI> Be not afraid of this last E∣nemy, while you are preparing for the encounter, thô Nature calls him the King of Terrors. By Faith behold <HI>your Mighty Saviour Dying</HI> on the Cross, that he might take away Sin the sting of Death, and destroy him that had the power of Death, <HI>which is</HI> the Devil. Behold Him <HI>descen∣ding into the Grave,</HI> that this might be a bed of rest unto you; Behold him, <HI>Rising Victorious,</HI> and that as a Publick Person, and become the first fruits of them that slept. Behold Him in our Nature <HI>Ascending into Heaven,</HI> where He is gone to prepare a Place for you, that when the frail House of this earthly Tabernacle shall be dissol∣ved, you may have an House not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. And do not perplex your selves with disquieting thoughts about the Time or Circumstances of your Death; but cast all those cares and burdens on the LORD, and say with the Psalmist, Psal 23.4. <HI>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
<PB N="23" REF="002956_0025_0FE6A55B4F941538"/>will fear no evil: for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</HI> And be assur'd that neither Death nor Life — shall be able to separate you from the love of GOD which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. <HI>For you to live is Christ, and to die shall be gain.</HI> 1 Cor. 15.55, — 58. <HI>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thinks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, un∣moveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
