<HEAD>AN ATTESTATION, From the very Reverend Dr. <HI>Increase Mather.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT the Churches of NEW-ENG∣LAND have been originally of the CONGREGATIONAL Perswasion and Profession, is known to every one. Their <HI>Platform</HI> does expresly dislike and disclaim the Name of INDEPENDENT. The Reason why that Name has been imposed upon them, was, Because they maintained, that a <HI>Particular,</HI> and <HI>Organised</HI> Church, has <HI>entire Power</HI> within it self, to manage the Affairs of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST, and the holy <HI>Discipline</HI> belonging to it, without a <HI>Dependence</HI> on any superiour Power on Earth. They Revere <HI>Synods,</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical Councils,</HI> consisting of <HI>Elders,</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> sent as Messengers of the Churches, when want of <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>Light,</HI> shall call for their Advice; but they
<PB N="ii" REF="002775_0003_0FE63005CC97FBD8"/>Esteem not <HI>stated Councils,</HI> or <HI>Synods,</HI> with a <HI>Ju∣ridical Power</HI> to be of Divine Institution.</P>
<P>What the Arguments were, which did satisfy them, that the <HI>Congregational Way</HI> is the <HI>way of Truth;</HI> 'Tis to be seen in the Books Published by those eminent Servants of CHRIST, who first settled Churches, in these Parts of the World; especially such as Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s Treatise of, <HI>The Keys.</HI> There is a Book under the Name of that Great Man, called, <HI>The Way of the Chur∣ches,</HI> which was published by a <HI>Brownistical Au∣thor,</HI> without Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s Consent or Knowledge. But in a Discourse after that was published, he refers the Reader, who desires to know his Judg∣ment about <HI>Church Discipline,</HI> unto his Book of, <HI>The Keys,</HI> and not that of, <HI>The Way.</HI></P>
<P>Another of the most eminent Divines that ever <HI>New-England</HI> saw, was Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Hartford. The Survey of Church Discipline,</HI> drawn by him, is a most Acute, Accurate, Logical Composure; some look upon it as Irrefragable, Unanswerable. It had the Approbation of all the Ministers, that were then in that and the next Colony.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> also in his learned Answer in La∣tin to the Enquiries of <HI>Apoll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius</HI> (a Dutch Di∣vine) argues clearly and strenuously, in Defence of the <HI>Congregational Church Discipline:</HI> A Book whereof Dr. <HI>Hornbeck,</HI> the famous Professor in <HI>Leyden,</HI> expressed a singular Esteem.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="002775_0004_0FE63005D187ABC0"/>
I might have mentioned, what my Father has written, for the Defence of these Churches, in Answer to two famous Divines, Mr. <HI>Charles Herle,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Rutherford.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that for certain <HI>Modalities,</HI> there has been a <HI>Variety</HI> of Practice, in these Churches; as there was in the Primitive; But in <HI>Essentials,</HI> both of Doctrine, and of Discipline, they agree. The <HI>Eccentric</HI> are but few; nor are there so many late <HI>Innovations,</HI> as to deserve any notice to be taken of them.</P>
<P>We look upon <HI>Reforming Presbyterians,</HI> as our dear Brethren: Among whom we have in par∣ticular a most brotherly Affection, for those in <HI>Scotland.</HI> When any come from thence, furnish∣ed with Testimonies of their <HI>Good Conversation in CHRIST,</HI> they are as welcome to our Communi∣on, as any Members of our own Churches. When the Persons of Both Perswasions in <HI>London</HI> became <HI>united Brethren,</HI> the Tidings thereof were highly acceptable to the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> in which they are ever so.</P>
<P>In the Title Page of our, <HI>Platform of Discipline,</HI> which was agreed by the <HI>Elders,</HI> and <HI>Messengers</HI> of the Churches in the <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Cambridge;</HI> 1648. it is said to be, <HI>Gathered out of the Word of GOD.</HI> It appears by the <HI>Historical Relation</HI> here faithful∣ly given of what is <HI>Practised</HI> in the Churches ac∣cording to that <HI>Platform,</HI> that it agrees as with the <HI>Apostolical Time,</HI> so with the <HI>Practises</HI> of the Christians in the Age next unto the <HI>Apostles;</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="002775_0005_0FE630079CC8BE70"/>except in some <HI>Superstitions,</HI> which the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> never had among them.</P>
<P>The Churches here, were Planted <HI>a noble Vine.</HI> Indeed it was not with respect to the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that our Fathers came into this Wil∣derness. For they agree to the <HI>Doctrinal Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> (as fully as any, and more fully than many,) of the <HI>Conformists</HI> in that Church. But it was with Regard unto <HI>Church Order</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> that our pious Ancestors the <HI>Good old Puritan Nonconformists,</HI> transported them∣selves and their Families, over the vast Ocean to these goings down of the Sun. On which Ac∣count, a Degeneracy from the Principles of pure <HI>Scriptural Worship</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> in the Church, would be more Evil in the Children of <HI>New-England,</HI> than any other People in the World.</P>
<P>May what is here performed, (with an <HI>Erudi∣tion,</HI> as well as a <HI>Fidelity,</HI> which I hope, will Re∣commend the Work,) be blessed for their <HI>Direc∣tion</HI> and <HI>Establishment</HI> in the <HI>Good old Way,</HI> in which their Fathers have walked; The Writer of this <HI>Ratio Disciplinae</HI> will then have cause to re∣joyce in this his Labour.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Introduction.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOSE <HI>English Colonies</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> which are distinguished by the Name of NEW-ENGLAND, were formed upon the Glorious Design, of erect∣ing CHURCHES, wherein the <HI>Reformation</HI> should be carried on, unto farther Degrees of Scriptural and Primitive <HI>Purity;</HI> than would be allowed by the <HI>Times</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> not yet wholly recovered out of the <HI>Antichristian Apostacy.</HI></P>
<P>The Planting of these CHURCHES, (which, <HI>having obtained Help from GOD, continue unto this Day</HI>) was one of the MAGNALIA CHRISTI, in that Age th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has passed over us: The <HI>His∣tory</HI> whereof has in a large Volumn, of such a Title, been given to the World. There may be a Mis∣interpretation, if <HI>That</HI> should now be said; which has been often said, That as the <HI>Adversaries</HI> of
<PB N="2" REF="002775_0007_0FE6300ED70BCF90"/>this Country, (which has many more than <HI>Twice seven times Seven Golden Candlesticks</HI> illuminating of it,) have heretofore, even to a Proverb, sped as Ill, as those that Adversaried the Ancient <HI>Piccardines,</HI> thus it has been also observed, That Remarkable <HI>Blessings</HI> from GOD have recom∣pensed the <HI>Good Offices,</HI> that well disposed Persons have done unto it. Instead of making any such Observation, it is enough to say, There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those in other Parts of the World, who <HI>wish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell</HI> unto the Country, and have at Heart the Interests of it: A Country which one of the most celebrated Pens in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> could not mention, but in those Terms; <HI>A Place of as serious Piety as any I can hear of under Heaven.</HI> It is partly with an Eye to the Satisfaction of such <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Just</HI> Men that an Account of the <HI>Churches</HI> here, and what they <HI>are,</HI> and what they <HI>do,</HI> is now to be exhibited; And, no doubt, One Effect of it will be, that it may bespeak a Continuance of <HI>Good Offices,</HI> from such as are the Friends of <HI>Pure and Undefiled Religion.</HI> And the <HI>Best of Protestants</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> will Judge, how far a People, whom a Great Man in an English Parliament vouchsafed once to call, <HI>The Best of Protestants,</HI> be worthy to be look'd upon, as their UNITED BRETHREN.</P>
<P>With <HI>such,</HI> and with all that have reigning in them, the Generous and Catholick <HI>Spirit of Christianity</HI> (whereof One has given us this true Pourtraiture, <HI>C'est Esprit universel, qui ne connoist point toutes ces Distinctions Charnelles, Lesquelles divi∣sent aujourd hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tant des petits Esprits dans le Monde,</HI> (A <HI>Catholic Spirit</HI> which is above the <HI>carnal Distinc∣tions,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002775_0008_0FE6300EDB292BB8"/>that make such <HI>Divisions</HI> at this Day, a∣mong the <HI>Narrow Souls</HI> of the World] it will be far from any Prejudice, but, we are well assured, it will be very grateful unto them, to under∣stand, That the Differences between PRESBY∣TERIAN and CONGREGATIONAL, seem hardly to be known in this Country Tho' the <HI>Discipline</HI> Recommended by the SYNODS of these Churches, be that which we call CON∣GREGATIONAL, yet it is their Desire and Study, that a Good Man, who long since wrote an <HI>Unio Reformantium,</HI> should not be mistaken, when he said, <HI>The Congregational are a Choice, if not the Best part, of the Presbyterians.</HI> Reforming <HI>Presbyterians</HI> retiring sometimes from <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> hither, have been as heartily esteemed and embraced here, as any of the Pastors born and bred in the Land; and as the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have imposed nothing on them, that they could <HI>conscienciously</HI> have any Scruple of; (Especially not <HI>Re-Ordination:</HI>) thus they have not only conformed unto the <HI>Customs</HI> of the Churches, but have even made <HI>Conscience</HI> of doing so. Yea, Tho' the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> cannot admit of many things, which they reckon <HI>Deformities</HI> retained in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> according to its present <HI>Canonical Consti∣tution,</HI> yet they cannot see, why they may not claim to be <HI>Real,</HI> and even some of the <HI>Soundest</HI> Parts of the <HI>True Church of England,</HI> according to the Intention of the <HI>first Reformers.</HI> And therefore in an Address of the <HI>New-English</HI> Ministers, unto the Earl of <HI>Bellomont,</HI> when he was Governour of <HI>New-England,</HI> they not only asserted this People
<PB N="4" REF="002775_0009_0FE6300FE13E19F0"/>to be, <HI>A Nation of Nonconformists, which those in</HI> Scotland, <HI>justly look upon as their UNITED BRE∣THREN;</HI> but also declared, their <HI>Churches</HI> to be those wherein the <HI>Pure Doctrine in the famous</HI> Ar∣ticles <HI>of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>is owned and preached with all possible Purity, and the Primitive Discipline, which even the Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England <HI>wishes to see restored; is practised.</HI> They will with Satisfaction understand it, that not on∣ly those of the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Communion, are admitted into Communion in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> when they come with <HI>Testimo∣nials</HI> to ask for it; but they make only the <HI>Sub∣stantials of Religion,</HI> or that <HI>Vital Piety</HI> wherein <HI>all Good Men</HI> are united. the <HI>Terms of Communion</HI> among them, and they do with Delight see Godly <HI>Congregationals,</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> and <HI>Antipoedobaptists,</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI> all Members of the same Churches, and sitting together with∣out Offence about their <HI>lesser Differences,</HI> (in the same <HI>Holy Mountain</HI>) at the same <HI>Holy Table.</HI> And if it should <HI>now</HI> be said concerning them, to the <HI>Governours,</HI> that come over with the Royal Commission, to take the Charge of them, this will not be the <HI>First Time</HI> that it has been said;
<Q>While our Churches are not built on any <HI>Foun∣dation</HI> but the <HI>Maxims of the Everlasting Gospel,</HI> plainly Exhibited in the SACRED SCRIP∣TURES, and know no <HI>Terms of Communion,</HI> but the Indisputable Points of that <HI>solid Piety,</HI> wherein all Good Men are united, we assure our selves that Governours, who have no <HI>Par∣tiality</HI> for <HI>little Parties</HI> in Religion, will count them Worthy of their Protection, and will
<PB N="5" REF="002775_0010_0FE6300FE72D82B0"/>commend them to the <HI>Royal Favour</HI> upon all Occasions.</Q></P>
<P>There is no need of Reporting what is the <HI>Faith</HI> professed by the Churches in <HI>New-England;</HI> For every one knows, That they perfectly ad∣here to the CONFESSION OF FAITH, pub∣lished by the <HI>Assembly</HI> of Divines at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and afterwards renewed by the <HI>Synod</HI> at the <HI>Sa∣voy:</HI> And received by the Renowned <HI>Kirk</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> The <HI>Doctrinal Articles</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> also, are more universally held and preached in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> than in any Nation; and far more than in <HI>our own.</HI> I cannot learn, That among all the Pastors of Two Hundred Churches, there is <HI>one Arminian:</HI> much less an <HI>Arian,</HI> or a <HI>Gentilist.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Neo∣nomian</HI> and <HI>Antinomian</HI> Errors, about the great Point of, <HI>A Sinners Justification before GOD,</HI> which a while since bred such a Scandalous Contenti∣on among the <HI>Nonconformists</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> have not yet straggled over the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> to disturb this <HI>happy</HI> People.</P>
<Q>— <HI>Foelices nimium sua si bona norint!</HI></Q>
<P>It is well known, that the Points peculiar to the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> are those of their <HI>Church Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>And we shall therefore in the first Place, of∣fer a Sum of their PRINCIPLES.</P>
<P>We will proceed then to Describe the PRAC∣TICES in which they generally manage and
<PB N="6" REF="002775_0011_0FE63012152B28B0"/>uphold their <HI>Principles.</HI> And that the Story may be the less <HI>Insipid,</HI> we will take the leave to <HI>Salt</HI> it now and then with <HI>Interspersed Notes</HI> of what we find practised in other Churches; especially in the <HI>Primitive:</HI> [Wherein you will also Ex∣cuse the Complement unto <HI>Vossius</HI> and <HI>Henninius</HI> in leaving the little <HI>Greek</HI> we use without the Encumbrance of the Novel and needless <HI>Accents</HI> upon it: Yea, since we are in a Book of <HI>Primi∣tive Things,</HI> we will hope to be excused, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he want of <HI>Types</HI> in our Press, compel us to give what little <HI>Greek</HI> we use, in <HI>Capitals:</HI> For the writing of <HI>Greek</HI> otherwise than in <HI>Capitals,</HI> was introduced in later Ages, by the Monks of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who borrowed the smaller Letters now used, from the <HI>Coptic:</HI>] Which will be the more easily pardoned, when 'tis remembred that in our <HI>brief Remarks,</HI> we shall a little imitate what was done in the RATIO DISCIPLINAE FRA∣TRUM BOHEMORUM, written by that In∣comparable <HI>Comenius,</HI> who once had resolved upon coming over, at an Invitation to become the President of <HI>Harvard College</HI> in this Country, if he had not, by being invited unto <HI>Sueden,</HI> been diverted from it.</P>
<P>¶. For the PRINCIPLES of these <HI>Churches;</HI> they are declared in their, PLATFORM OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE; which has been so often published, and is in so many Hands, that there is no need of giving here a New <HI>Edition,</HI> or indeed any <HI>Abridgement</HI> of it. And there is the less need of such a Repetition, because their <HI>Principles</HI> will be all along sufficiently discover∣ed,
<PB N="7" REF="002775_0012_0FE630121A17B7D0"/>by their <HI>Proceedings,</HI> and the <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Cus∣toms</HI> obtaining among them, which are now go∣ing to be related. Let this only be here obser∣ved, and still Remembred; Those Reverend Persons of the <HI>Presbyterian Way,</HI> who published their <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> so many Years ago, do expres∣ly say, <HI>That they agreed with the Things of the great∣est Concernment in it; and that those things wherein they differed from it, were of lesser Consequence, where∣of their Debates were not</HI> Contentiones <HI>but</HI> Colla∣tiones.</P>
<P>But <HI>Besides,</HI> and indeed, <HI>Before,</HI> the <HI>Platform,</HI> there were several <HI>Treatises</HI> long ago published, wherein the <HI>Principles</HI> of these CHURCHES, were, as with Loud sounding Trumpets, pro∣claimed unto the World.</P>
<P>One of them was, the famous COTTON's Book of, <HI>The Keys;</HI> Which the celebrated <HI>Ru∣therford</HI> approv'd, as being <HI>sound</HI> in every thing; except (as <HI>he</HI> thought) that of not giving <HI>Autho∣rity</HI> quite enough to <HI>Synods.</HI> The Memorable <HI>Owen,</HI> attempting to write an Answer to that Book, was instead of <HI>Confuting</HI> it, so <HI>Conquered</HI> by it, that he came entirely into the Sentiments of it; and so liv'd, and so held, and so wrote, all the rest of his Days.</P>
<P>Another of them was, the <HI>Responsio</HI> to a <HI>Sylloge Quaestionum</HI> sent hither from <HI>Zeland;</HI> which Ans∣wer was written in <HI>Latin</HI> by the famous NOR∣TON, at the <HI>Unanimous Desire and Order</HI> of the Ministers then shining in the Country. What
<PB N="8" REF="002775_0013_0FE6301782B515B0"/>Satisfaction it gave, may be gathered, from the Attestations of Dr. <HI>Goodwyn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> Mr. <HI>Symp∣son</HI> unto it; Yea, and from the Respectful men∣tion, with which Dr. <HI>Hornbeck</HI> magnifies the <HI>Rea∣son</HI> and <HI>Candour</HI> of the Author, even in those Points, wherein he dissents from him. Dr. <HI>Ful∣ler</HI> also in his <HI>Church-History</HI> has these Words up∣on it; <HI>Of all the Authors I have perused concerning these Opinions, none to me was more Informative, than</HI> Mr. John Norton, <HI>One of no less Learning, than Modesty, in his Answer to</HI> Apollonius, <HI>Pastor of the Church in</HI> Middleburgh.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church-State</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> even in these Exhibitions of it, is, <HI>by reason of Strength</HI> now come to more than <HI>Fourscore Years;</HI> But the <HI>Strength</HI> holds; it is to be hoped, that it will not be <HI>soon cut off;</HI> or indeed ever <HI>fly away.</HI></P>
<P>Some have, suddenly enough, pronounced the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> as too little <HI>agreed</HI> among themselves in the Affairs of their <HI>Ecclesi∣astical Policy.</HI></P>
<P>But certainly, there is a <HI>General Agreement</HI> a∣mong them in these Articles.</P>
<P>First. A People resolving to adhere unto the Maxims of the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> and live unto GOD according to all the Rules of Incontestible PIETY, and appearing in a competent and a convenient <HI>Number,</HI> to form an <HI>Assembly</HI> for the Worship of GOD our SAVIOUR, in all His Institutions, may <HI>Associate</HI> for that Purpose;
<PB N="9" REF="002775_0014_0FE63017870B1DA8"/>and (if their Assembling will be no evident Pre∣judice unto the <HI>Kingdom of GOD,</HI> and <HI>Welfare of Men,</HI> in <HI>Societies</HI> already formed for that Purpose, whereof they ought to be the Members,) they have a <HI>Right</HI> so to do.</P>
<P>Secondly. A Body of such People, so <HI>Associat∣ing,</HI> are an <HI>Instituted Church,</HI> and have all the <HI>Rights</HI> of a <HI>particular Church</HI> belonging unto them; A <HI>Spiritual Corporation,</HI> which has Power to ob∣serve the <HI>Appointments</HI> of our SAVIOUR, and <HI>Elect</HI> what <HI>Officers</HI> He has appointed for them, and <HI>Censure</HI> such <HI>Offenders</HI> as may prove <HI>Roots of Bitterness</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Pastors</HI> that such a Church has chosen to <HI>Watch for their Souls,</HI> qualified for their Work, and Accepting the Charge, have a <HI>Power</HI> to manage the <HI>Public Sacrifices</HI> of the Gospel in their Flocks, and particularly to administer the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of the New Testament unto the pro∣per Subjects of them.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Every <HI>Church</HI> thus <HI>formed as a People for the Praise of GOD,</HI> ought, in Things of <HI>common Coneern,</HI> which will affect the <HI>Tranquillity,</HI> or de∣mand the <HI>Acknowledgement,</HI> of <HI>other Churches,</HI> bound up in the <HI>Faith and Order of the Gospel</HI> with them, to pay a great Regard unto their <HI>Advice,</HI> and ask for it on recurring Occasions.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The <HI>Sacred Scriptures</HI> are the <HI>sufficient Rule</HI> for <HI>Belief,</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> among the People of GOD; And a <HI>Brotherly Fellowship</HI> is
<PB N="10" REF="002775_0015_0FE6301D7B90BBC8"/>to be maintained with <HI>all Good Men,</HI> in the Things wherein we apprehend them to follow these <HI>Di∣vine Directions.</HI></P>
<P>At the same time they are for extending <HI>In∣dulgence</HI> further than they can <HI>Communion,</HI> and are for an <HI>Indulgence</HI> of <HI>Civil Rights</HI> in the <HI>State</HI> unto all that approve themselves Faithful <HI>Subjects,</HI> and Honest <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and such Inoffensive Livers, that <HI>Humane Society</HI> cannot complain of Distur∣bance from them</P>
<P>True ELEUTHERIANS will consider, how far any <HI>further Agreement</HI> may be Necessary: And whether those unreasonable Sons of <HI>Procrustes,</HI> the Narrow-soul'd and Imperious Bigots for <HI>Unifor∣mity,</HI> will do <HI>Religion</HI> any real Service, by the pressing of it.</P>
<P>Behold, The <HI>Puritanismus Novanglicanus!</HI></P>
<P>¶. Such a <HI>Foundation</HI> being laid, the <HI>Superstruc∣ture</HI> is now waited for. It will be seen in the PRACTICES of the <HI>Churches,</HI> which are now going to be related.</P>
<P>[Let it be remembred; The <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Province, are all <HI>Christianized;</HI> ex∣cept the Eastern Salvages, which have been <HI>An∣tichristianized</HI> by the Popish Missionaries. Among our <HI>Christianized Indians,</HI> there are not only many <HI>Worshipping Assemblies;</HI> but also a Number of <HI>Ga∣thered Churches</HI> walking in the <HI>Faith and Order of the Gospel:</HI> And these endeavour in all Points all possible Conformity to the <HI>English Churches</HI> of the Country in their Administrations.]</P>

XVIII. 20. <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</HI> And hence <HI>Tertullian</HI> encourageth himself to say, <HI>Ubi tres, Ecclesia est, licet Laici.</HI> Nevertheless, because it has been apprehended, that a Rule of <HI>Church-Discipline</HI> in the <HI>Eighteenth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Matthew,</HI> cannot be well reduced in∣to Practice, by any Number under <HI>Seven,</HI> and for more Reasons that might be rendred, <HI>Seven</HI> is the least Number that has been allowed among us, as capable to form a <HI>Church State</HI> for the En∣joyment of all <HI>special Ordinances;</HI> But usually there is a larger Number expected.</P>
<P>§. 2. The MEN who by mutual Conferences with one another, are come to a good Under∣standing and Resolution for the <HI>Gathering of a Church,</HI> are usually such as are already the <HI>Mem∣bers</HI> of other Churches; and obtain an Allow∣ance from the said Churches, for them to bear a part in this Action; which Allowance is usually signified in a <HI>Written Instrument</HI> If any of them are not so, they give to these Brethren such an Account of their Qualifications for the Work now before them, and they are so satisfied in their <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Behaviour,</HI> that they admit them into their Number.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002775_0018_0FE6301F46D55FD8"/>
§. 3. In <HI>former Times,</HI> a Church of Brethren has been sometimes <HI>Gathered,</HI> without any One in their Number yet Elected or Expected by them, for their <HI>Pastor.</HI> And the <HI>Gathering of a Church</HI> has been the sole Work of the Day, with∣out the <HI>Ordination</HI> of a <HI>Pastor.</HI> The Work has been carried on with admirable Solemnity, and left an Everlasting Impression on the Multitude of Spectators: A Work full of <HI>Hol Glory.</HI> But in <HI>later Times,</HI> a <HI>Church</HI> is rarely Gathered, with∣out a <HI>Candidate of the Ministry,</HI> being one of the Number for the intended Coalition; who has been for some while a <HI>Preacher</HI> unto them; And on the Day of their <HI>Gathering,</HI> his <HI>Ordination</HI> is also solemnized.</P>
<P>§. 4. The Persons who are engaging and combining for the weighty Undertaking of <HI>Ga∣thering a Church,</HI> set a part a Day to be spent by them together in <HI>Prayer with Fasting,</HI> that they may prepare for what is before them, and confess their Dependence on Heaven for Favours which they own themselves unworthy of, and obtain the Blessing of GOD; [On which Day, they privately together <HI>Sign</HI> their <HI>Covenant.</HI>] Some∣times more than one such Day; Sometimes in a <HI>Public Assembly,</HI> where the Neighbouring Pastors come to instruct and assist them. They think it proper to make a very <HI>Great Preparation</HI> for an Undertaking the most Holy, and Awful, and Heavenly, that can be on this side Heaven engag∣ed in.</P>
<P>§. 5. In time convenient the <HI>Good Men of this Intention,</HI> (who from first to last, privately wait upon <HI>Pastors</HI> in the Neighbourhood for their Di∣rection)
<PB N="4" REF="002775_0019_0FE630261E18AA88"/>send <HI>Letters</HI> unto the Pastors and Chur∣ches of the Neighbouring Towns, (what number they Judge convenient) wherein they report what they intend, on a Day therein specified; and request that the <HI>Pastors</HI> with other <HI>Messengers</HI> or <HI>Delegates</HI> of the said Churches will please then to Countenance their Proceedings, at the Place also specified. The <HI>Pastors</HI> Read these <HI>Letters,</HI> to their <HI>Churches,</HI> and the <HI>Delegates</HI> or <HI>Messengers</HI> to accompany them, unto this Transaction (up∣on the Nomination of the <HI>Pastors,</HI> with <HI>Liberty</HI> then allowed for the <HI>Brethren,</HI> to nominate any more if they see Cause) are by some <HI>Vote</HI> ap∣proved and appointed for it.</P>
<P>§. 6. The <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Messengers</HI> from the Churches of the Vicinity, convening at the Time and Place assigned, and chusing their <HI>Mo∣derator,</HI> the Candidates of the <HI>New Church</HI> appear before them, and present unto them a, <HI>Confession of their Faith,</HI> and therewithal the <HI>Covenant</HI> or <HI>Engagement,</HI> in which they recognize their Obli∣gations, to <HI>serve</HI> the Great GOD their Saviour, and to <HI>walk</HI> with one another, in the <HI>Faith and Order of the Gospel.</HI> They produce also the <HI>Testi∣monials</HI> of the Allowance which the Churches whereto they formerly belonged, have given them to Transfer their more immediate Relation unto the Society now to be gathered. In the former times, the Brethren on this Occasion also exhibited, either Orally or in Writing, some ac∣count of each Mans Conversion from his unre∣generate State unto serious Piety; or, <HI>The Rea∣son of the Hope which is in him,</HI> that a Saving Work of Regeneration has passed upon him.
<PB N="5" REF="002775_0020_0FE630262230E630"/>This is for sundry Reasons not <HI>now</HI> so much in∣sisted on.</P>
<P>§. 7. A vast Assembly of Christians from the Vicinity usually come together on such an Oc∣casion; and fill the <HI>Meeting House.</HI> But Care is taken to leave some vacant Seats in the <HI>Meeting-House,</HI> for the <HI>Council;</HI> who now walk together unto it, First, the <HI>Past<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs,</HI> and then the <HI>other De∣legates</HI> of whatever Quality. The <HI>Associated Bre∣thren</HI> likewise take a Place together, which is left empty for them.</P>
<P>A MEETING HOUSE is the Term that is most commonly used by the <HI>New English</HI> Christi∣ans; Tho' as long ago as <HI>Eusebius,</HI> yea, and as <HI>Tertullian,</HI> the Term of <HI>A Church</HI> was used for it. And every Town for the most part, can say with <HI>Tertullian, Nostrae Columbae Domus Simpiex;</HI> They have modest and handsome Houses for the Wor∣ship of GOD; not set off with Gaudy, Pompous, Theatrical Fineries, but suited unto the Simplici∣ty of Christian Worship. <HI>Holiness of Places</HI> is however no more believed among them, than it was in the Days of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lemens Alexandrinus,</HI> who says,
ΠΑΣ ΤΟΠΟΣ ΙΕΡΟΣ — <HI>Every Place is in truth holy, where we receive the Knowledge of GOD;</HI> or in the yet earlier Days of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> who says,
ΕΝ ΠΑΝΤΙ ΤΟΠΩ ΤΗΣ ΙΗΣ — <HI>In every part of the Earth, GOD has promised that He will accept our Sacrifices.</HI></P>
<P>§. 8. Ardent PRAYERS are then poured out, pertinent unto the Solemn Action then before them; wherein the <HI>Glories</HI> of the Great GOD, and our Saviour are confessed, and His <HI>Blessings</HI> on His Churches, are implored, especially on <HI>That</HI> which is now gathering.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002775_0021_0FE63027D9BCAB38"/>
A SERMON agreeable unto the Action is then also preached; unto which a <HI>Prayer</HI> is added.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prayers</HI> are usually made by several Mi∣nisters, which either the <HI>Council,</HI> or at least the <HI>Moderator</HI> of the Council calls the reunto.</P>
<P>After this the <HI>Moderator</HI> signifies unto the As∣sembly, That there are then present a Number of Christian Brethren [whose <HI>Names</HI> he recites out of a List before him, and at the reciting whereof they immediately stand up, in Token of their Disposition to proceed,] Intending with the Help and Leave of our Glorious LORD, immediately to <HI>gather themselves into a Church</HI> be∣fore Him. And he offers unto the <HI>Assembly,</HI> a <HI>Liberty</HI> to make any <HI>Objection,</HI> if they have any to make, against any one <HI>Person</HI> or <HI>Matter</HI> in the Present Proceedings.</P>
<P>Upon a Convenient Pause, no Man object∣ing the <HI>Moderator</HI> turns himself to the <HI>Council,</HI> and proposes to <HI>Them,</HI> that if they do <HI>approve</HI> of the Brethren proceeding unto the Action that is now before them, and Consent hereupon to re∣ceive them and regard them as a CHURCH of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, their <HI>Silence</HI> will be taken to signify it.</P>
<P>Hereupon the <HI>Moderator</HI> in very solemn Terms, does call upon the <HI>Brethren,</HI> that with <HI>Hands (and Hearts!)</HI> lifted up to Heaven, they now <HI>attend</HI> and <HI>consent</HI> unto the COVENANT of GOD, which is now to be read before them. So <HI>He</HI> reads, [while <HI>They</HI> keep their Hands lifted up to Heaven: Or at least lift them up at his Di∣rection at the End of the Reading:] The main

<P>We declare our serious Belief of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> as contained in the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> and with such a View thereof as the <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> in our Churches has exhibited; hear∣tily resolving to conform our Lives unto the <HI>Rules</HI> of that Holy Religion as long as we live in the World.</P>
<P>We give up our selves unto the Lord JEHO∣VAH, who is the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and <HI>avouch Him this Day to be our GOD,</HI> our <HI>Father,</HI> our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and our <HI>Leader,</HI> and receive Him as our <HI>Portion</HI> forever.</P>

<P>This done, the <HI>Moderator</HI> makes a <HI>Speech,</HI> wherein he declares unto the <HI>Brethren,</HI> their Ac∣ceptance into the Number of the Churches, and mightily <HI>exhorts</HI> and <HI>charges</HI> them in the Name of the most Glorious LORD, that they endeavour now in all things, to <HI>live</HI> according to the <HI>Pro∣fession</HI> which they have thus made, not only be∣fore <HI>Men,</HI> but in the Presence of the Great GOD, and of His <HI>Holy Angels;</HI> and he invites the whole Assembly to give Thanks unto GOD, for the Blessings of the Gospel, which they are led now to take Notice of.</P>
<P>§. 9. In <HI>former times,</HI> it was no rare thing for the Publick Solemnities of a <HI>whole Day,</HI> to be as∣signed unto that one Action, of <HI>Gathering</HI> a CHURCH, and to defer unto <HI>another Day</HI> the Action of <HI>Ordaining</HI> a <HI>Pastor</HI> to the Church: But in <HI>later times</HI> these <HI>two Actions</HI> are generally car∣ried on <HI>together;</HI> that is to say, on the same Day that the <HI>Church</HI> is <HI>Gathered,</HI> the <HI>Pastor</HI> of the Church is also <HI>Ordained.</HI> Sometimes on these Occasions, the Action of <HI>gathering</HI> the Church has been managed more <HI>privately</HI> in the Presence of the <HI>Delegates</HI> from the Neighbourhood: and contenting themselves with such a private and previous Management of <HI>that,</HI> they have then gone to the <HI>Meeting-House</HI> more <HI>publickly,</HI> in a great Assembly to carry on that other Action of
<PB N="10" REF="002775_0025_0FE6302EDD614550"/><HI>Ordaining</HI> the <HI>Pastor</HI> of the Church. But many Good Men rather chuse and wish, that this <HI>great Action,</HI> may be done in as <HI>publick</HI> a Manner as may be; For 'tis indeed one of the greatest Things that can be done among the Children of Men; 'Tis a Glorious Homage paid unto the <HI>Son of GOD,</HI> and a Testimony born to His Reli∣gion; 'Tis rarely performed when in the Hands of a wise <HI>Moderator,</HI> without <HI>Floods of Tears</HI> in the affected Spectators, and lasting <HI>Impressions of Piety</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>§. 10. The CHURCH-COVENANT thus used in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> is by In∣telligent and Considerate Persons, looked upon as no other than the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> more par∣ticularly applied unto the <HI>Duties</HI> and <HI>Concerns</HI> of <HI>particular Churches. Particular Churches</HI> are in their Apprehension an <HI>Institution</HI> of our Lord Redeem∣er; and there are <HI>particular Duties,</HI> which the Members of these Churches owe unto their <HI>El∣ders,</HI> and unto one another. The <HI>Church-Covenant</HI> is but an <HI>Acknowledgement</HI> of the Obligations to <HI>these Duties</HI> lying on the Members of the Church∣es. No Body denies that GOD commands Men to <HI>acknowledge</HI> their Obligations to the <HI>Du∣ties</HI> of their several Relations: But then it ap∣pears very plain, that the more <HI>explicit</HI> they are in such a Transaction, on such an Occasion as that of <HI>Gathering a Church,</HI> 'tis the <HI>Better</HI> on all Accounts; And the <HI>Great King whose Name is Venerable,</HI> is always to be served with <HI>our Best.</HI> It is an Ancient Maxim not peculiar to the Per∣sons of the <HI>Congregational</HI> Way, <HI>Foederata Conjunctio constituit Ecclesiam.</HI> And indeed, it seems beyond
<PB N="11" REF="002775_0026_0FE6302EE15C3110"/>all Contradiction, That where Men do not, <HI>Im∣plicitly</HI> at least, Agree, and Engage to Worship our Saviour together, according to His Laws, they cannot be esteemed, a <HI>Church.</HI> But then, if an <HI>Implicit Covenant</HI> be of such Importance to the Being of a <HI>Particular Church,</HI> 'tis argued, sure∣ly an <HI>Explicit Covenant</HI> is Expedient, Profitable, Desireable. Without something of this Nature, 'tis asked, How can there be such a <HI>Joining</HI> and <HI>Cleaving</HI> together, as there was Exemplified for Christian Churches, in that which was the <HI>Mo∣ther of them all!</HI> Acts II. 42.</P>
<P>Antiquity is no Stranger to this Notion. 'Tis <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Description of a Church, <HI>Corpus sumus, de Conscientia Religionis, et Disciplinae Unitate, et Spei Foedere:</HI> Which is as much as to say, <HI>A Body United for the Conscientious Observation of the Duties of Religion, by an Agreement in Discipline, and a CO∣VENANT of Hope for Eternal Blessedness.</HI> The same <HI>Tertullian,</HI> in his <HI>Apology,</HI> says, that the Christians then Assembled, <HI>Ad Confoederandam Disciplinam;</HI> which intimates, that they had a <HI>Discipline,</HI> and a COVENANT for the <HI>Disci∣pline.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> the Governour of <HI>Bithynia</HI> relates, in his Letter to the Emperor [which our <HI>Tertullian</HI> also refers to,] That some <HI>Renegado Christians,</HI> being Examined about the secret, but sacred <HI>Conventi∣cles</HI> of the Faithful in those Primitive Times, confessed no worse of them than this; That they entred into a COVENANT,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ne Furta, ne Latrocinia, ne Adulteria committerent, ne Fidem fallerent, ne depositum abnegarent.</NOTE> To <HI>do no dis∣honest Thing</HI> in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002775_0027_0FE6303491960F58"/>
In the Apology of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> who lived within a few Years of the Apostles themselves, we find the Christians who were admitted into <HI>Church-Fellowship,</HI> agreeing in a <HI>Resolution to con∣form in all Things to the Word of GOD:</HI> Which seems to be as truly a <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> as any in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>And these Churches hope that they shall not hear that Reproached as a <HI>New Invention,</HI> which was practised in the <HI>Second</HI> and <HI>Third</HI> Centuries.</P>
<P>The famous Dr. <HI>Hornbeck,</HI> a Professor in the University of <HI>Leyden,</HI> who wrote in Defence of the <HI>Presbyterian Church-Government,</HI> has published his Approbation of what the <HI>New-English</HI> Divines <HI>Cotton,</HI> and <HI>Mather,</HI> and <HI>Norton,</HI> wrote in Defence of their <HI>Explicit Church-Government.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Zepperus</HI> writes it as the Manner and Or∣der of the Churches in <HI>Holland; That when any Persons are admitted unto the Lord's Table there, they make a publick Profession of their Faith before all the Church; and likewise COVENANT, that they will continue in that Faith, and lead their Lives accord∣ingly.</HI></P>
<P>Several <HI>Synods</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> have required <HI>Personal Covenanting</HI> with GOD, and the Church; and the Incomparable <HI>Voetius</HI> highly applauds their doing so.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Episcopal Way</HI> complains of the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> That they would not admit a Man to the <HI>Lord's Table</HI> without a <HI>Pro∣mise</HI> (or COVENANT) of continuing in the <HI>Faith.</HI> 'Tis no more indeed, than what we find provided by their <HI>National Synods;</HI> That none
<PB N="13" REF="002775_0028_0FE6303496DF6860"/>were admitted as Members of the <HI>Reformed Chur∣ches</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> without a publick entring into a COVENANT of GOD, with <HI>Submission to Dis∣cipline.</HI></P>
<P>The very learned <HI>Parker</HI> gives this Account of the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> (whereto Persecuti∣on had exiled him) <HI>That when any Person seeks for Admission into Church Communion, his Name is published in the Congregation, that if any one hath ought to object against the Person propounded, he should acquaint the Elders therewith. If nothing is brought against him, he is admitted, but not without a Solemn COVENANT with GOD, and the Church: And to the Church he promises to walk as becomes that holy Fellowship: That he will submit unto the Discipline of the Church; and that he will watch over the Bre∣thren of that Communion, according to the Command of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> appear well satisfied with the Words of the famous <HI>Bax∣ter. I conclude, That whatever some particular Per∣sons may be guilty of, there is no real Difference be∣tween the Presbyterians and Independents, in the Point of Church-Covenant. — GOD forbid, That any Faithful Minister of CHRIST, should fight against that which is profitable to the Well-being of a Church, meerly because the Church without it may have a Be∣ing. Then must we plead for Hunger and Want, and Calamitous Diseases, that leave us but the Being of Men. Nature and the Scripture Praecedents in the Old Testament, and the Doctrine of the Apostles, and the Ancient Practice of the Churches, do satisfy us of the Usefulness of holy Covenants, prudently, seriously, and seasonably made.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002775_0029_0FE6303656D955B0"/>
If the Church thus formed, have proceeded (as they usually do) unto a Good Agreement about a Person to be their <HI>Pastor,</HI> the <HI>Ordination</HI> of this their <HI>Pastor</HI> is also consummated, at this Time, in the Assembly, immediately upon their <HI>Confoederation.</HI> The Methods of it are to be fetch∣ed out of the ensuing Article.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE II. The <HI>Ordaining</HI> of a PASTOR.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. WHEN a Church wants a PASTOR, they do first, by <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting,</HI> humbly supplicate our <HI>Ascended</HI> Redeemer, who <HI>giveth such Gifts unto Men,</HI> that He would give unto them, <HI>A Pastor, after His own Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Then (except the Providence of Heaven have otherwise laid <HI>Prospects</HI> of <HI>Supplies</HI> before them,) upon Consultation with the <HI>Christian Inhabitants</HI> of the Town, ask Information from the <HI>Ministers</HI> in their Vicinity, or from the Governours of the <HI>College,</HI> What <HI>Young Men,</HI> may be most like∣ly to be serviceable unto them. And being thus, or otherwise informed, the <HI>Committee</HI> whom the Church usually have to act on their behalf, in such an Affair, invite one or more of these <HI>Can∣didates,</HI> to preach a few <HI>Sermons</HI> among them.</P>
<P>Hereupon they hope for an Opportunity, to observe, whether any of these <HI>Candidates</HI> answer
<PB N="15" REF="002775_0030_0FE630365AF98480"/>the <HI>Character</HI> which a famous Council at <HI>Carthage</HI> required in one to be ordained; Before all things, <HI>to have a good natural Wit, to be apt to teach, to be moderate in his Conversation, to be sober in his Life, to be diligent, humble, affable, full of Compassi∣on; to be learned, to be instructed in the Law of the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, to interpret the Word of GOD soberly and pru∣dently, and to be able in a clear and plain Manner to explain the Doctrines of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>One Reason why the <HI>Churches</HI> have been here∣tofore less <HI>Explicit</HI> and <HI>Accurate,</HI> than otherwise they might have been, in a <HI>Solemn Examination</HI> of those whom they <HI>Elect</HI> and <HI>Ordain</HI> for their <HI>Pastors,</HI> has been, because they never <HI>Elect</HI> any but such as are already admitted as <HI>Communicants</HI> at the <HI>Holy Table</HI> in the <HI>Churches.</HI> And the <HI>Chur∣ches</HI> admit none, but such as give them full Satis∣faction of their being <HI>Sound in the Faith,</HI> and <HI>Per∣sons of a godly Life.</HI></P>
<P>§. 2. If there be a <HI>Candidate,</HI> for which they take a singular Liking, perhaps, they Renew their Invitation unto him, to preach the Word of GOD among them, in a more <HI>Constant Way,</HI> for some Time convenient. Or, However in Time convenient, the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church meet and pass a Vote of this Importance;</P>
<P><HI>That they will make an orderly Proceedure, with all convenient Expedition, to chuse and call</HI> Mr. A. B. <HI>unto the Pastoral Care over them; Now, upon Trial being satisfied of his Ability, and Fidelity, for the Dis∣charge of that Office unto them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> after this, have a Meeting with the other Inhabitants of their Neighbourhood, who are not yet arrived unto the State of <HI>Com∣municants;</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002775_0031_0FE6303C59518970"/>When they do <HI>all</HI> together put it unto the <HI>Vote, Whether they have no Objection against the Choice of</HI> Mr. A. B. <HI>to be the Minister of the Place; but shall concur to support him in the Exercise of his Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>Except the <HI>Major-Part</HI> of the Inhabitants (in∣clusive of the <HI>Communicants</HI>) do agree to this lat∣ter <HI>Vote,</HI> the <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> does not in the <HI>Law,</HI> make the <HI>whole</HI> Taxable in the Mainten∣ance of the Minister which the <HI>Church</HI> doth chuse.</P>
<P>In Case of a Difference between the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> on this Occasion, the <HI>Law</HI> provides the Remedy of a <HI>Council,</HI> from three Neighbour Churches, to decide, <HI>Whether the In∣habitants ought to acquiesce in the Choice, wherein the Church has gone before them.</HI></P>
<P>§ 3. Tho' the <HI>Law</HI> of the Place, about the <HI>Chusing and Settling of a Minister,</HI> (which has had the <HI>Royal Sanction</HI>) be a very wholesome Law, and have much of the <HI>Gospel</HI> in it, yet there grows too much upon the <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> who are not yet come into the <HI>Communion</HI> of the Churches, a Disposition to supersede it, and over-rule it; Many People would not allow the <HI>Church</HI> any Priviledge to go before them, in the Choice of a <HI>Pastor.</HI> The Clamour is, <HI>We must maintain him!</HI></P>
<P>Some of our Divines having been on such an Occasion consulted withal, have exhibited their Sentiments in these Conclusions.</P>
<Q><P>A Body of Christians <HI>Associated</HI> for all the Ordinances of the Gospel, are a CHURCH of our Glorious LORD, which have among
<PB N="17" REF="002775_0032_0FE6303C5D7E2008"/>other precious Priviledges, a RIGHT from HIM, <HI>To chuse their own Pastors.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Churches</HI> which have recovered the Ex∣ercise of this RIGHT <HI>from the Oppression of Man,</HI> under which many <HI>Churches of the Reformation</HI> are to this Day groaning, ought to <HI>keep the Precepts,</HI> and the Favours of the Lord, and not easily part with what He has given them.</P>
<P>To introduce a <HI>Practice</HI> in the <HI>Choice of a Pastor</HI> which being followed, may soon bring a <HI>Pastor</HI> to be chosen for a <HI>Church,</HI> which <HI>few,</HI> yea, <HI>none</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> have ever Voted for, would be to <HI>Betray</HI> and even <HI>Destroy</HI> a most Valuable RIGHT, that such a Society has a Claim unto, and many <HI>Evil Consequences</HI> are to be expected from it.</P>
<P>Nevertheless a CHURCH in the Exercise of its RIGHT, ought in all possible Ways consistent therewithal, to consult the <HI>Edificati∣on</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of their Neighbours; espe∣cially of those on whose <HI>Assistance,</HI> to carry on their Affairs, they may have much Depen∣dence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> ought so to manage their <HI>Choice</HI> that if the Neighbours have any just <HI>Dissatis∣faction,</HI> all the Respect required by <HI>Scripture, Reason,</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> may be paid unto it.</P></Q>
<P>To express the <HI>Condescention,</HI> in the close of these Conclusions, the Churches, do sometimes, by their <HI>Vote,</HI> make a <HI>Nomination of Three or Four</HI> Candidates; For every One of which the Ma∣jority of the Brethren have so Voted, that whom∣soever of these the <HI>Choice</HI> falls upon, it may still be said, <HI>The Church has Chosen him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002775_0033_0FE6303E4BBE4960"/>
And then they bring this <HI>Nomination</HI> unto the other Inhabitants, to join with them, in a <HI>Vote</HI> that shall determine, which of them shall be the Man.</P>
<P>But what must be the Age of the <HI>Candidate?</HI></P>
<P>Without any Information from the Gentlemen who have (like <HI>Bartholomaeus Agricola</HI>) written, <HI>De Aetate ineuntium Officia;</HI> We know, not only what was the <HI>Age</HI> of Admission to the Exercise the <HI>Priesthood</HI> under the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law; but also, how critical the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were about it; <HI>Alexan∣der ab Alexandro</HI> sets the Age, when One would think it fitter to <HI>lay down</HI> than to <HI>take up</HI> an Office; And we have <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Exclamation; <HI>Quae major Contumelia est, quam venire in Sacerdotium imberbem Adolescentulum?</HI> Nevertheless, in these Days of the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> there is <HI>nothing certain</HI> defined about the Number of Years, which a Minister of the Gospel, must have passed before he be or∣dained. Some <HI>Councils</HI> have set a <HI>Number of Years</HI> for it; But the learned <HI>Reizius</HI> passes a Censure on them, as having done <HI>Incautelously;</HI> and he brings the Instance of <HI>Timothy,</HI> who while he was but a <HI>Young Man,</HI> so discharged the <HI>Evangelical Ministry,</HI> as to be no dishonour to it: And the Words of <HI>Bullinger</HI> have their Weight in them; <HI>Hominem Ingenia, non a Vetustate, ut Vina, aestimanda sunt; sed ab ipsa probitate et Eruditione.</HI> Accordingly the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> con∣sider not so much the <HI>Age,</HI> as the <HI>Worth</HI> of a Candidate for an <HI>Ordination</HI> in them. And their Glorious Lord often blesses them with <HI>Elihu</HI>'s; They often see very <HI>Young Ministers,</HI> who give
<PB N="19" REF="002775_0034_0FE6303E4FF363A8"/>them Occasion to think on the Jewish Maxim, <HI>Sapiens appellatur Senex, etiamsi Diebus sit Exiguus.</HI></P>
<P>§. 4. Now they proceed unto a <HI>Salary,</HI> to be offered unto the <HI>Minister,</HI> whom they have cho∣sen. [To which there is usually added some∣what also, which they call, <HI>A Settlement,</HI> in order to some Subsistence of his Family, in Case he dy among them.] This no doubt, will be <HI>mo∣derate</HI> enough: But such as they may think will suffice a <HI>Divine</HI> of that Order, which <HI>Erasmus</HI> has described in his Preface to his <HI>New Testament. Is mihi THEOLOGUS est, qui non Syllogismis Arte contortis, sed Affectu, sed ipso Vultu atque Oculis, sed ipsa Vita doceat, aspernandas esse opes Christiano, non esse fidendum hujus Mundi Praesidiis, sed totum opor∣tere pendere de Caelo.</HI></P>
<P>There have too frequently all along been <HI>cul∣pable Proceedings,</HI> and a <HI>Withholding of more than is meet,</HI> in the Churches under the Dispensation of the <HI>New Testament;</HI> relating to this Affair: And they that have <HI>abhorred Idols,</HI> have yet <HI>committed Sacriledge.</HI> Besides more early Reservations of the <HI>Church-Stock,</HI> only ΤΟΙΣ ΔΕΟΜΕΝΟΙΣ, <HI>Chrysostom</HI> tells us, that in <HI>Elections,</HI> those of the Competi∣tors that had <HI>Estates of their own</HI> carried it, be∣cause the Churches would save the Charges of maintaining them. Yea, some <HI>Councils</HI> ex∣presly, and sinfully enough, provided, That <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> tho' learned Men, should subsist them∣selves on some honest <HI>Imployment,</HI> with a <HI>Proviso,</HI> which 'tis a Wonder how any Wise Men could propose it, <HI>That it be no Prejudice to their Office.</HI> And how <HI>strait handed</HI> this way many Professors
<PB N="20" REF="002775_0035_0FE63043C5E0FD58"/>of Religion in the <HI>Churches of the Reformation</HI> have been, hath been known and felt, and thousands of times complained of.</P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have <HI>not so learn∣ed CHRIST.</HI> They make the most publick Re∣cognitions, of their <HI>Obligations</HI> to that plain and just Law of CHRIST, <HI>They which preach the Gos∣pel, should live of the Gospel.</HI> And a Decree of a National Synod of the Reformed Churches in <HI>France,</HI> has been considered among them; which ran in those Terms;
<Q>All the Churches shall be desired to shun Ingratitude unto their Minis∣ters, a Sin too rife among us; and take speci∣al Care, that they be more respected and their Labours better rewarded: Not to enrich and fatten them, but to give them a becoming and sufficient Maintenance.</Q></P>
<P>In some Churches, the Salary of the Minister is raised by a <HI>Voluntary Contribution;</HI> especially in populous Places, and where many Strangers re∣sort; But in others, a <HI>Tax</HI> is levied for it; there being too much Truth in <HI>Luther</HI>'s Words
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r profecto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> misere viverent Evangelii Minis∣tri, si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ex libera Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ali Contributione o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent sustentandi.</NOTE>. <HI>The Mi∣nisters of the Gospel would have a poor Time of it, if they must rely on a free Contribution of the People for their Maintenance.</HI> In those (which are <HI>almost all</HI>) Parts of the Country, where the Stipend of the Minister is raised by a <HI>Tax</HI> upon the People, the Case is thus. The <HI>Laws</HI> of the Province, having had the <HI>Royal Approbation</HI> to ratify them; they are, <HI>The Kings Laws.</HI> By these Laws, it is Enacted, <HI>That</HI> there shall be a <HI>Public Worship</HI> of
<PB N="21" REF="002775_0036_0FE63043CA2FE518"/>GOD in every Plantation; That the Person Elected by the <HI>Majority</HI> of the Inhabitants to be so, shall be looked upon as, <HI>The Minister of the Place:</HI> That the <HI>Salary</HI> for him, which they shall agree upon, shall be levied by a Rate upon all the Inhabitants. In Consequence of this, the <HI>Minister</HI> thus Chosen by the People, is (not only CHRIST's, but also) in Reality, <HI>The Kings Mi∣nister.</HI> And the <HI>Salary</HI> raised for him, is raised in the <HI>Kings</HI> Name, and is the <HI>Kings</HI> Allowance unto him. If the most of the Inhabitants in a Plantation, are <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> they will have a <HI>Minister</HI> of their own Perswasion. And the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI> if there be any, in the Place, must pay their Proportion of the <HI>Tax,</HI> for the Support of this <HI>Legal Minister.</HI> In a few of the Towns, a few of the People, in Hope, of being released from the Tax for the <HI>Legal Minister,</HI> sometimes profess themselves <HI>Episcopalians.</HI> But when they plead This for their Exemption, their Neigh∣bours tell them, <HI>They know in their Conscience, they do not as they would be done unto.</HI> And if a Governour, go by his Arbitrary Power, to super∣sede the Execution of the Law, and require the <HI>Justices</HI> and <HI>Constables</HI> to leave the <HI>Episcopalians</HI> out of the Tax, the People wonder, he is not aware, that he is all this while, forbidding, <HI>That the King should have his Dues paid unto him;</HI> and forbidding the <HI>Kings Minister</HI> to receive what the <HI>King</HI> has given him. However, the <HI>generous Condescensions</HI> that have been sometimes made in this Matter, are such, that the People of <HI>New-England</HI> have therein Exemplarily, <HI>adorned the Doctrine of GOD their SAVIOUR,</HI> and have done
<PB N="22" REF="002775_0037_0FE630464F70E180"/>what has not been ordinarily exemplified among <HI>any other</HI> People. Sometimes the <HI>Quakers</HI> also, have given some Occasion for Uneasiness. But, Where <HI>Quakerism</HI> is troublesome, some Towns are so wise to involve the Salary of the Ministry in a <HI>general Rate</HI> for all <HI>Town Charges,</HI> and so the Cavils of those, who would else refuse to pay the Rate for the <HI>Ministry,</HI> are obviated.</P>
<P>How many of our Ministers, do yet generously spend very much upon their <HI>own Estates:</HI> And how unfairly and untruly, some of them have of∣ten been defrauded of their Dues; and how pa∣tiently and holily they have encountred their <HI>Temptations,</HI> has been <HI>known</HI> unto their Glorious LORD.</P>
<P>§. 5. Things being thus prepared, the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> do by a renewed Vote, now de∣clare, <HI>That they make Choice of</HI> Mr. A. B. <HI>to be their Pastor;</HI> and appoint certain Persons to wait upon him, with a Report of this their Vote, and consult with him about a Day for his <HI>Ordina∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>In these Proceedings there is a Seasonable Care taken, That if he were a Member of some <HI>other Church,</HI> he have his <HI>Dismission,</HI> (his Relation declared to be transferred,) unto that which now have their Eye upon him, to be their <HI>Pas∣tor;</HI> that as near as may be, according to the Primitive Direction, They may <HI>chuse from among themselves.</HI></P>
<P>§. 6. The <HI>Day</HI> for his <HI>Ordination</HI> being agreed upon, the Brethren agree with him; what <HI>Churches</HI> they will desire to be present at the in∣tended Solemnity. <HI>Letters</HI> are then addressed un∣to
<PB N="23" REF="002775_0038_0FE6304653972300"/>each of these Churches;
<Q><HI>Informing</HI> them, that they have made Choice of such a Person for their <HI>Pastor;</HI> and <HI>Requesting</HI> them, that they would by their <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Messengers,</HI> afford their Presence and Countenance, and Assis∣tence, unto his Ordination; [<HI>At the Time and Place now specified:</HI>] and concluding with such Expressions of holy Affection and Charity as would be dictated by our holy Religion, on such an Occasion.</Q> The Letters are <HI>Subscribed</HI> by such of the Church, as are judged most suitable to do it, <HI>In the Name of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Brethren</HI> use to make Choice of some Neighbouring <HI>Pastors,</HI> (among those whom they have sent unto,) to perform the IMPOSITION OF HANDS in the designed <HI>Ordination;</HI> And <HI>One</HI> among them to make the <HI>Prayers,</HI> and give the <HI>Charges</HI> in that Action: Unto which <HI>One</HI> at least, they privately some Days aforehand, signi∣fy what they have thus <HI>Voted,</HI> that so he may <HI>prepare</HI> to answer their Expectations. And in all those Points, they have a private Conference and Concurrence with the Person that is to be <HI>ordained.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes the Church leaves it unto the Mi∣nisters of the <HI>Council,</HI> at their coming together on this Occasion, to determine, Who of their Number shall take part in the <HI>Imposition of Hands,</HI> at the <HI>Ordination.</HI></P>
<P>§. 7. When the <HI>Council</HI> of the Neighbouring <HI>Pastors,</HI> and the <HI>Messengers</HI> whom the Churches address'd unto, have chosen to accompany them, do come together, unto the House assigned
<PB N="24" REF="002775_0039_0FE6304BC7EE78C8"/>them, and formed themselves into a <HI>Council</HI> with the Choice of their <HI>Moderator,</HI> [where the <HI>Dea∣cons</HI> of that Church are now attending upon them,] the Church send some of their principal Brethren, to inform them, that they have desired such a Reverend Person (unto whom accord∣ingly they now apply themselves,) to manage the Votes, and give the Charge in the Ordination to which they are now approaching: And what Reverend Persons they have desired for to join with him in the <HI>Imposition of Hands.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> then (if they have no <HI>Objection</HI> to make against the Intentions of the Day,) appoint one of their Number to give <HI>the Fellowship of the Churches,</HI> in their Name, unto the Person that shall be ordained.</P>
<P>Thus we find in the <HI>Primitive Times;</HI> A <HI>Pastor</HI> elected by the <HI>People, was ordained,</HI> (as <HI>Eusebius</HI> expresses it,) <HI>With the common Consent of the Bishops in the Vicinity.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> then walk in order, with the Per∣son to be <HI>ordained,</HI> unto the <HI>Publick Assembly:</HI> which is usually a very thronged one: But with some Seats left appropriated; some for the <HI>Council</HI> now convened; some for the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church whose <HI>Vote</HI> is anon to be called for. For as <HI>Jerom</HI> of old, <HI>Requiritur in Sacerdote ordinando, etiam Populi praesentia.</HI> And <HI>Cyprian</HI> would have the <HI>Pastor Established in the Presence of all the People, who have narrowly observed his Conversation.</HI></P>
<P>§. 8. The Day is (or should be!) kept a <HI>Sa∣cred Fast</HI> unto the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002775_0040_0FE6304BCDB56258"/>
In former times, on the longer Days, it was no unusual Thing, to have <HI>Two</HI> public Meetings, both a <HI>Forenoon,</HI> and an <HI>Afternoon</HI> Service, on this Occasion.</P>
<P>The Custom has been, that among the other Exercises of the Day, the Person expecting his <HI>Ordination,</HI> does by <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> before the Assembly, give some Discovery, that he un∣derstands the <HI>Work,</HI> to which he is now to be <HI>Separated.</HI> Several of these, have been afterwards published, by which it may be seen, how <HI>compa∣rable to fine Gold,</HI> have been the <HI>Nazarites.</HI></P>
<P>Of later Times, 'tis grown Customary, if there be time for it, for some <HI>Elder Divine</HI> also to give a Sermon proper for the solemn Occasion; and for some such to make some of the Supplicati∣ons.</P>
<P>Yea, Sometimes the Person to be Ordained has of late been excused from Offering any Ser∣mon at all on this Day; it being (by some) thought more decent for some Elder <HI>Divine,</HI> to deliver such Things as are most proper for the Day.</P>
<P>When these are over, The MODERATOR, mentioning the Reason of their being thus as∣sembled; First, applies himself unto the <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Messengers</HI> of the Churches there present, and signifies unto them,
<Q>That if they have any <HI>Objection</HI> to make against the <HI>Ordination</HI> which is now otherwise to be proceeded in, they have now an Opportunity to offer it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>None</HI> being offered; (after a due Pause) he then applies himself to the whole <HI>Congregation,</HI> and particularly to those who propose to sit un∣der
<PB N="26" REF="002775_0041_0FE6304E8C9A41E0"/>the Ministry now to be established, with an Intimation,
<Q>That if any of the People know any thing, either in the <HI>Doctrines</HI> or the <HI>Morals</HI> of the Person, who now stands a Candidate for an <HI>Ordination,</HI> that may be a just <HI>Objection</HI> a∣against him, they have now a Liberty to tender it.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing being tendered, he now applies him∣self unto the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the CHURCH, who have called the Assembly thus together, desiring them, <HI>That, if they abide by their Choice of</HI> Mr. A. B. <HI>to be their Pastor, and will according to the Word of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, submit unto him as their Overseer, and One who is to Watch for their Souls, they would signify it by lifting up their Hands.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis very certain, That the <HI>Right</HI> of a <HI>Church,</HI> To <HI>Chuse its own Pastor,</HI> was Recognized and Ex∣ercised, in all the Times of <HI>Primitive Christianity;</HI> Yea, 'twas one of the Last things that the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> ravished from the <HI>People of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Liberty</HI> in this Matter, with which our <HI>Ascended</HI> REDEEMER has enfranchised and enriched His Churches, appears to have been so conced∣ed by His Apostles, that when we read, [Act. XIV. 23.] <HI>They ordained them Elders in every Church;</HI> it is evident from the known use of the XEIPOTONIA which was used in it, that the Text is to be read, <HI>They had by the Suffrages of the People, created them Elders in every Church.</HI> The Apostles only <HI>Praesided,</HI> and the People under their Conduct <HI>Elected.</HI> The taking away of this <HI>Priviledge</HI> from the <HI>People,</HI> is by <HI>Calvin</HI> justly cal∣led, <HI>Impia Ecclesiae Spoliatio;</HI> A <HI>Spoil impiously</HI> com∣mitted on the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD. Yea, Our <HI>Eng∣lish
<PB N="27" REF="002775_0042_0FE6304E90966DF0"/>Bibles</HI> themselves, until they had undergone <HI>Episcopal Correction,</HI> at this Text, put in the Words, <HI>By Election;</HI> and the Margin had this Note; <HI>The Apostles did not thrust Pastors into the Church, thro' a Lordly Superiority, but chose and placed them by the Voice of the Congregation.</HI> All <HI>Antiquity</HI> confesses the Part which the <HI>People</HI> had in the Choice of their <HI>Pastors.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Constantine,</HI> writing to those of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> could say to them, That it was <HI>in their Power,</HI> to make Choice of what <HI>Pastor</HI> they pleased; and it freely depended on <HI>Their Judgment.</HI> And the Council of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> speaking of the Church at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> could say, <HI>That such a Bishop should be given them, as should be elected by the Consent of those whom he was to feed.</HI> Yea, this Right was most notoriously claimed by the, <HI>Plebs obsequens Praeceptis Dominicis, et Deum metuens,</HI> the godly People, in the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prianic</HI> Age; It was then Incontestibly allowed, <HI>Plebs ipsa maxime h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beat Potestatem, vel eligendi dignos Sacer∣dotes, vel indignos recusandi!</HI> The Power of <HI>Elect∣ing</HI> and of <HI>Rejecting</HI> their <HI>Pastors,</HI> let the <HI>People</HI> have it.</P>
<P>We all know, what <HI>Confessions</HI> of this Matter, the <HI>Protestants</HI> in defending the <HI>Reformation,</HI> find themselves compelled unto.</P>
<P>But, no Wonder! When Father <HI>Paul</HI> himself, in his Treatise, <HI>Of Beneficiary Matters,</HI> expresly says;
<Q>Pope <HI>Leo</HI> shews amply, that the <HI>Ordina∣tion of a Bishop</HI> could not be Lawful or Valid, which was not <HI>Requir'd</HI> by the People, and <HI>Ap∣prov'd</HI> by them; which is <HI>said by all the Saints of those Times;</HI> and St. <HI>Gregory</HI> thought <HI>Constance</HI> could not be consecrated <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Milain,</HI> be∣ing
<PB N="28" REF="002775_0043_0FE63053AD8405F8"/><HI>Elected</HI> by the <HI>Clergy,</HI> without the Consent of the <HI>Citizens,</HI> who by reason of Persecution retired to <HI>Genoa;</HI> and he prevailed, that they should be first sent unto, to know their Will; A Thing worthy to be noted in <HI>our Days,</HI> where that <HI>Election</HI> is declared to be Illegitimate and Null, in which the People have any Share.</Q> Thus, (a, <HI>Rara Avis in Terris!</HI>) An Honest <HI>Ro∣manist.</HI> Even in <HI>Rome</HI> itself, the <HI>People Elected</HI> their Bishop, until the <HI>Twelfth Century.</HI> And a Council in the middle of the <HI>Seventh Century,</HI> makes the <HI>Ordination</HI> of a Bishop to be Void, where he is not <HI>Elected</HI> by the <HI>People</HI> No wonder, that <HI>Protestants,</HI> and especially <HI>New-English</HI> Ones, lay so much Stress on the <HI>Choice</HI> which a <HI>Church</HI> makes of a <HI>Pastor.</HI> Even <HI>Bzovius</HI> the Jesuite, gives diverse Reasons, why the <HI>Popular Election of Ministers</HI> continued for many Ages, and even to the Days of <HI>Charlemaign;</HI> One is, That <HI>Pastor</HI> and <HI>People</HI> may have a <HI>Due Love</HI> to one another. Yea, Upon quoting an Order of a Council at <HI>Rome, Ab omni Ecclesia eligatur consecrandus Episcopus,</HI> and an Order of another Council at <HI>Clermont, Episcopus omnium conscendat Electione,</HI> a Learned and Worthy Presbyterian (Mr. <HI>Lauder</HI>) of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> carries his Remark so far, as to say,
<Q>Hence it is evident, That Persons are <HI>Constituted</HI> or made <HI>Bishops,</HI> by the <HI>Election</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> and not by <HI>Ordination</HI> which is performed by the <HI>Bishops.</HI></Q></P>
<P>§. 9 Their <HI>Suffrage</HI> being then given the <HI>Moderator</HI> turns to the Person, whose <HI>Ordination</HI> is now carrying on; signifying,
<Q>That since he observes the <HI>Call</HI> unto the <HI>Ministry of the Gospel,</HI> and
<PB N="29" REF="002775_0044_0FE63053B4491DD8"/>unto the <HI>Pastoral Charge of the Flock</HI> in this Place, which has been given him, it remains for him to declare his Acceptance of it!</Q> The <HI>Expectant</HI> (whom in the French Reformed Chur∣ches they called, The <HI>Proposan,</HI>) hereupon turns himself to the Assembly with a Declaration of this Importance;
<Q>That with an humble Reli∣ance on the Glorious Head of the Church, for His Gracious Assistances, he does accept of the Work, and Charge to which he is invit∣ed; Requesting the Prayers of all Good Men that he may obtain the <HI>Mercy to be found Faith∣ful</HI> unto the Lord, and unto His People.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Moderator</HI> now goes on to say, that such and such Persons having been desired to join in the Solemn <HI>Imposition of Hands,</HI> on the Person who is now to be set apart, for the special Ser∣vice of the Sanctuary, they shall proceed unto it.</P>
<P><HI>Dioscorus</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> was ordain∣ed by no more than <HI>Two</HI> Persons; nevertheless, the Council of <HI>Calcedon</HI> owned him, and fre∣quently termed him, <HI>The most Reverend.</HI> The <HI>odd Ordination</HI> of <HI>Evagrius,</HI> we say nothing of.</P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> have not yet limited any <HI>Number,</HI> as necessary to this Action; though rarely fewer than <HI>Three,</HI> have been em∣ployed on this Occasion.</P>
<P>They then laying <HI>their Hands</HI> on <HI>his Head,</HI> He who was chosen to that Service, makes an ar∣dent <HI>Prayer</HI> unto the Glorious GOD; particular∣ly, <HI>Acknowledging</HI> the Glories of the enthroned
<PB N="30" REF="002775_0045_0FE63055B7218A68"/>JESUS, and the Great Things done for and in the Church, by that <HI>Prophet,</HI> and <HI>Priest,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>King</HI> thereof; and Petitioning the Lord now to accept that Servant of His which is here set apart for the special Service of His Gospel and Kingdom in the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prayer</HI> being finished, he proceeds, (Their <HI>Hands</HI> continuing still imposed) with a Speech unto the Person under their <HI>Ordination,</HI> which is a most solemn and awful <HI>Charge</HI> unto him faith∣fully to attend the Duties of his Ministry: In some such Terms as these.</P>
<P><Q>Whereas <HI>You,</HI> on whom, we now, to declare so much, do Impose our Hands, are called un∣to the Work of the <HI>Evangelic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Ministry</HI> in the Church of the Living GOD, and unto the Office of a <HI>Pastor</HI> in the <HI>Particular Church</HI> of the Lord, with which we are now assembled; we do now introduce you into that awful Station. We therefore charge you, before the Great GOD, and our SAVIOUR the Glorious <HI>Head of the CHURCH, That</HI> you <HI>take heed unto the Mi∣nistry which you have Received from the Lord,</HI> plainly, and faithfully, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atchfully to <HI>fulfil it,</HI> and as one that must <HI>give up an Account un∣to Him; That</HI> you <HI>feed the whole Flock</HI> whereof you are now <HI>made an Overseer;</HI> and therein study to shew yourself <HI>approved of GOD,</HI> and a <HI>Workman that needs not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; That</HI> you <HI>Pray without Ceasing,</HI> and <HI>give yourself to Reading and Meditation, and Preach the Word, Instruct, Reprove, Exhort, with all the Long Suffering</HI> that becomes a Servant of GOD; <HI>That</HI> you admi∣nister the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of the New Covenant,
<PB N="31" REF="002775_0046_0FE63055BB2DDF30"/>as a <HI>Wise and Good Steward</HI> of those heavenly Mysteries; <HI>That</HI> you impartially dispense the <HI>Discipline,</HI> with which the <HI>House of the Lord</HI> is to be ordered, and His Kingdom expressed and maintained, making a Difference between the <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>profane:</HI> And, <HI>That</HI> you be an <HI>Exam∣ple of the Believers,</HI> in your whole <HI>Conversation,</HI> with all <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> endeavouring to exhibit the <HI>Graces</HI> of that Lord unto whose pe∣culiar Service you are now devoted. And, <HI>If you keep this Charge,</HI> We declare unto you, That the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> will give you a Place among His <HI>Elect Angels,</HI> who doubtless, do now stand by as <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the solemn <HI>Action,</HI> wherein we are now engaged; Witnesses to the <HI>Bonds</HI> and <HI>Vows</HI> of GOD, which you have now with all possible Solemnity taken upon you; yea, We declare unto you, that if you do this, when the Lord JESUS CHRIST shall appear, <HI>you shall appear with Him in Glory;</HI> He who is the <HI>Chief Shepherd,</HI> will then give you a <HI>Crown of Glory,</HI> that shall <HI>never fade away.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Hereupon in another <HI>Prayer</HI> (Their <HI>Hands</HI> remaining still imposed) he proceeds to recom∣mend the Person thus <HI>ordained,</HI> unto the Mercies of the Glorious LORD; Beseeching the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Almighty, to possess him, and migh∣tily improve him, and assist him, and succeed him; and make him <HI>Faithful unto the Death;</HI> and be also gracious unto the <HI>Flock</HI> which is now committed unto him.</P>
<P>This being done (and the <HI>new Pastor</HI> having received <HI>Prayers by the Hand,</HI> as the Phrase for it was among the Ancients;) The <HI>Moderator</HI> de∣clares
<PB N="32" REF="002775_0047_0FE6305CCA366528"/>unto the <HI>Church,</HI> that this Person is now their <HI>Pastor;</HI> Advising and Exhorting them to <HI>acknowledge him as one set over them in the Lord, and esteem him very highly in Love for the sake of his Work,</HI> while he Labours among them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moderator</HI> then signifies to the Assembly that a certain Minister then present, is chosen by the <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Messengers</HI> of the Churches, to give in their Name, unto the Person thus or∣dained, <HI>The Right Hand of their Fellowship.</HI></P>
<P>It was required in the <HI>Ecclesiastical Discipline of the Protestants in</HI> France; <HI>The Prayer being ended and the new Pastor standing up, Two Deputies of the Synod or Colloque, shall in the Presence of all the People give him, THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOW∣SHIP.</HI> So 'tis in the Discipline of their <HI>New-English</HI> Brethren.</P>
<P>The Minister now steps forth, and before the whole Assembly, having spoken what he thinks fit about the <HI>Evangelical Affairs</HI> of the Churches, he applies himself unto the <HI>newly Ordained Person;</HI> Telling him in the Name of the Churches, What they <HI>Wish,</HI> and what they <HI>Hope</HI> concerning him; and that in Token of their acknowledging him, as a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel regularly <HI>ordained,</HI> and of their Satisfaction in the Proceedings of the Church, which have thus invited him unto the Exercise of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> he does now give him the <HI>Right Hand of Fellowship:</HI> (and so he gives him his <HI>Right Hand:</HI>) Even as <HI>James,</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> of old, unto <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas;</HI> own∣ing a <HI>Fellowship</HI> in the Service of the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002775_0048_0FE6305CCE24F0F0"/>
The Speeches on these Occasions, are now u∣sually <HI>Concise</HI> and <HI>Short.</HI> But formerly, they were sometimes <HI>Ample</HI> and <HI>Copious.</HI> Yea, several such Speeches have been preserved in our Printed Monuments.</P>
<P>That this Action may be illustrated, here shall be one Instance given of such more <HI>extended Speeches;</HI> and the rather because of some Illustra∣tions upon the Affairs of the Churches contain∣ed in it.</P>
<Q><P>The Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> tho' in their <HI>Congregational</HI> Constitution, they do the most nearly of any answer the <HI>Primitive,</HI> (which are now proved for to have been such beyond all Contestation,) yet from the very Begin∣ning have renounced the Name of <HI>Independent;</HI> and have justly and wisely declared against such an <HI>Independency,</HI> as would leave them <HI>Un∣related</HI> to each other, and <HI>Unconcerned</HI> in each others Interests. Every <HI>particular Church</HI> is to consider it self as a part of the <HI>Catholic,</HI> and owes a Duty to the <HI>whole Visible Church</HI> of our Lord in the World. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Churche therefore are <HI>Consociated</HI> for <HI>mutual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>munion,</HI> and <HI>mutual Assistence,</HI> and have so much <HI>Dependence</HI> on one another, that in Things of a more <HI>General Im∣portance,</HI> and in such Things as may Affect the Vicinity, they abhor to <HI>Act alone.</HI> Upon that Passage in the Epistle to the Romans, <HI>The Churches of Christ salute you,</HI> I remember, that not only our great <HI>Calvin</HI> observes, The Holy Spirit would <HI>mutuo Amoris nexu devincire,</HI> bind the Churches of the Lord fast to one another in the Bonds of Love: But also <HI>Grotius</HI> himself
<PB N="34" REF="002775_0049_0FE630BE34AC0628"/>has this Note, <HI>The Communion to be maintained between particular Churches, is here intimated and animated.</HI></P>
<P>One special and singular <HI>Occasion</HI> for this <HI>Com∣munion of Churches,</HI> is when a <HI>Pastor</HI> is ordained in any of them; one for whom the Acknow∣ledgements, due to such an one, are expected from <HI>All the Churches</HI> in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of this Intention, the <HI>Delegates</HI> of the <HI>Neighbouring Churches</HI> which were ad∣dressed for their Countenance to the present Action, have commanded the unworthiest of their Number, in their Name, to express their <HI>Fellowship,</HI> with this Church of the Lord, on the acceptable Occasion that is now before us.</P>
<P>It is not enough to bear me out in the Ac∣tion which I am now called unto, That there is the same Action done, among our Brethren in the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> They are Scriptural Precepts or Patterns, from which we are to fetch our <HI>Warrant</HI> for what we do. And, O Churches of the Lord, Your <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Safe∣ty</HI> will be in keeping forever close to such a <HI>Warrant</HI> in all your Administrations! 'Tis in the sacred <HI>Scriptures</HI> that we find the Ministers of GOD, giving the <HI>Right Hand of Fellowship</HI> to one another, owning their <HI>Fellowship</HI> in the Ser∣vice of our Saviour, when they <HI>perceived the Grace that was given to them.</HI></P>
<P>In the Name of the Churches who have done me the Honour, to employ me in expres∣sing their Sentiments on the present Occasion, I now declare, That we have an abundant Sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="35" REF="002775_0050_0FE6305DD1E72140"/>in the <HI>Choice</HI> which this Church has made of the Pastor whom we have now seen ordained; And that we shall be ready to <HI>Assist</HI> and <HI>Strengthen</HI> this Holy Flock of the Lord, and this their <HI>Shepherd,</HI> unto the best of our Capacity, on all Occasions. I declare that we <HI>Ace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt</HI> the Person thus ordained, as one <HI>regularly brought into the Pastoral Character;</HI> one that has the Legitimate <HI>Vocation</HI> and <HI>Investiture</HI> of a <HI>Minister of the Gospel.</HI> And since the Scriptures of the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> have so evidently assert∣ed, the Validity of an <HI>Ordination by the Hands of the Presbytery,</HI> and informed us of no <HI>Order</HI> in the Church <HI>superiour</HI> to it; since the <HI>Catalogus Testium Veritatis,</HI> as I may call it, or the Testi∣mony of the Faithful in all Ages, has afforded such a <HI>Cloud of Witnesses</HI> unto the Truth of this Assertion; and since I cannot understand, that there are any Churches in the whole Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> I say, I know not of any Protestant and Reformed Churches in all the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> which do not subsist upon an <HI>Ordina∣tion,</HI> from an <HI>Order not superiour unto that of our Pastors;</HI> I know not why we should be so <HI>Un∣wise,</HI> not to say, <HI>profane,</HI> as to confess the least shadow of a <HI>Reason,</HI> Why the <HI>Validity of our Or∣dination</HI> should be questioned.</P>
<P>But then, I am to declare what we <HI>Desire</HI> for, and what we <HI>Expect</HI> from the Person, whose <HI>Ordination</HI> to the Evangelical Ministry has been thus far proceeded in.</P>
<P>Syr, 'Tis our Hope, that you will in the Discharge of your Ministry, study to <HI>Approve yourself a Workman that need not be ashamed;</HI> Be
<PB N="36" REF="002775_0051_0FE6305DD6C78330"/>an <HI>hard Student</HI> at home, and a <HI>good Steward</HI> abroad; that you will have such a <HI>Delight</HI> in your Work, as an excellent Person once unjust∣ly silenced from his Work, had for his, when he could say, <HI>No King ever swayed a Royal Scep∣ter with such Pleasure, as I have in Preaching the Gospel of my Glorious Lord:</HI> But then, That you will carry on your Work in such a Holy, De∣vout, <HI>Experimental</HI> Manner, as has been obser∣ved of several famous Ministers of whom 'tis recorded, <HI>That they never durst Preach any Sermon unto others, until they had first sensibly got some good by it themselves.</HI> May you, <HI>Syr,</HI> particularly receive your <HI>Burdens</HI> (as the <HI>Camels</HI> do) upon your Knees; you keep always in the <HI>Praying Posture</HI> that you may be carried thro' them. 'Tis our <HI>Hope,</HI> that in your <HI>Ministry,</HI> yea, and in your whole <HI>Behaviour,</HI> you will have your Eye upon a Glorious CHRIST continually, and be a <HI>Star</HI> always leading your Neighbours unto Him. You will observe the Description once given of one, for whom a Preferment was Designed, <HI>Nihil ardet, nihil appetit, nihil somniat praeter JESUM CHRISTUM:</HI> To <HI>know,</HI> and <HI>serve,</HI> and <HI>Resemble</HI> a precious CHRIST will be the Top of your Ambition. 'Tis our <HI>Hope,</HI> That you will extend your <HI>Pastoral Cares</HI> with most engaging <HI>Adaptations,</HI> to every part of your Flock, but very particularly the <HI>Young People</HI> in it; Instruct them, Advise them, lay the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges of GOD upon them, and with ir∣resistible Importunity perswade 'em to <HI>Early Piety;</HI> Be earnest with them, and never satis∣fied until you see them come to <HI>Religion in earnest,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="002775_0052_0FE63065DF7DD808"/>I will add but one Word more, The Churches of the Neighbourhood <HI>Hope</HI> it of you, <HI>That you will be Faithful to their True and Best Interests:</HI> That is to say, That you do your part for the preserving them, upon the <HI>Glorious Foundations</HI> of <HI>Conformity to the Laws of our Saviour,</HI> which was the professed End of these Plantations. A New Meeting-House erected by a Church of our Brethren on the other side of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> had those Words engraven on the Walls of it; <HI>Built not for a Faction, nor a Party, but for pro∣moting Faith and Repentance, in Communion with all that Love our Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity.</HI> It is the Glory our Churches, that this noble Motto belongs to them, <HI>Not for a Faction or a Party, but for promoting Faith and Repentance, in Communion with all the true Lovers of our Saviour.</HI> And the Sentence of a Worthy Man, who walked in <HI>our Way,</HI> expresses the Spirit which our Christians generally make Profession of; <HI>I will be one with every one, that is one with Christ.</HI> Such the <HI>Terms of their Communion,</HI> that we see godly <HI>Presbyterians, Independents, Episcopa∣lians, Antipaedobaptists,</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI> all in the sweet <HI>Harmony</HI> of <HI>Piety,</HI> sitting together at the same <HI>Table of the Lord</HI> in them. Nevertheless they think it <HI>their</HI> Duty, and <HI>your</HI>'s too, Syr, to be <HI>stedfast</HI> in that <HI>scriptural Purity,</HI> wherein we shall express our Loyalty and Chastity to the Glorious LORD who is our <HI>Lawgiver;</HI> and who continues His Favour to them that Love Him, and keep the <HI>Second</HI> with the Rest of His <HI>Commandments.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="002775_0053_0FE630BE39F693C8"/>
In Token hereof, I now give you, Syr, <HI>The Right Hand of our Fellowship;</HI> — And at the same time when we take you into <HI>ours,</HI> we carry you to him who <HI>holds the Stars in His Right Hand; There</HI> we put you; <HI>There</HI> we leave you; <HI>There</HI> we hope you will find a <HI>Crown of Life</HI> laid up for you, which the Lord at His appearing will give to them that <HI>Serve</HI> Him.</P>
<P>In the famous and holy Churches of <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> the <HI>Minister</HI> at his <HI>Ordination,</HI> had no soon∣er given his <HI>Oath</HI> unto GOD and the Church, to persevere in the Duties of his Ministry, but the <HI>Ordainer</HI> called for the Seventeenth <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>John</HI> to be read, saying, <HI>That your Faith of Help from Heaven may be confirmed, hear your Eter∣nal High Priest thus praying for you!</HI> And as the Historian says, <HI>Raro absque Lachrymis auditur.</HI> Syr, Let the Seventeenth <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> be now your Consolation, and let the Assurances it gives you fill you with Tears of Joy.</P>
<P>It was an Article given in the Charge to Ministers in ancient Ordinations, <HI>Think on Eter∣nity, Think on Eternity!</HI> Be faithful, Syr, and then know that you have before you an happy <HI>Eternity.</HI> When your Great Master shall bring you to walk with <HI>those who stand by,</HI> even the <HI>Elect Angels</HI> who stand by as <HI>Witnesses</HI> of what is done this Day, and of the Charge which you have this Day received, you will not repent of your Laborious and Assiduous Endeavours to serve His Kingdom in the World: You shall receive sufficient and Eternal Recompences.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="002775_0054_0FE63065E37535A0"/>
But our <HI>Fellowship</HI> is extended, and must ac∣cordingly be expressed, unto the <HI>Flock,</HI> which now see <HI>ordained</HI> for them the <HI>Pastor</HI> which they have <HI>Elected.</HI></P>
<P>You see, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> the Person to whom you are now to pay the <HI>Respect</HI> that is due un∣to your <HI>Pastor;</HI> and we hope his Conduct will be such as to deserve it. What that Respect is, you need no other Monitor to inform you, after you have read, 1 Thes. V. 12, 13. <HI>We be∣seech you, Brethren, to know them which labour a∣mong you, and are over you in the Lord, and admo∣nish you; &amp; to esteem them very highly in Love, for the sake of the Work they do.</HI> Yea, The common Rules of Reason, and of Conscience, will soon lead you to your <HI>Duty,</HI> if you will but hearken to the <HI>Dictates.</HI> This <HI>Pastor</HI> is yours; His <HI>Time</HI> is yours; his <HI>Strength</HI> is yours; his <HI>Talents</HI> are yours; his very <HI>Life</HI> it self is yours. He must <HI>Live</HI> with you, and if his Master call him, he must <HI>Dy</HI> for you. Do you now consider, Syrs, what you owe to <HI>him!</HI> Won't you <HI>Love</HI> him, and <HI>Prize</HI> him, and <HI>Pray</HI> for him, and <HI>Support</HI> him? He will meet with <HI>Temptations</HI> enow from other Quarters; I beseech you, let there be nothing in <HI>your Carriage</HI> towards him, that shall add unto his <HI>Temptations,</HI> and grievously discourage him. You will in this Matter find a sweet <HI>Reciprocation of Benefits.</HI> The more <HI>Good</HI> you <HI>Get</HI> by him, the more you will <HI>Do</HI> for him. And the more you <HI>Do</HI> for him, the more <HI>Good</HI> you will <HI>Get</HI> by him. Yea, GOD will <HI>reward</HI> your Kindness to him with such <HI>Spiritual Blessings▪</HI> of <HI>Souls thriving</HI> under his Ministry, as will carry
<PB N="40" REF="002775_0055_0FE63066E82008A0"/>rich Compensations with them. Syrs, This is he, from whose Ministry you look to be pre∣pared and ripened for the Heavenly World, and see your <HI>Children</HI> brought thither after you; And Oh! the Satisfactions with which you will meet each other in that Glorious World; when you shall say, <HI>Great GOD, I bless thee that ever I saw the Face and heard the Voice of this thy Ser∣vant;</HI> And he shall say; <HI>My GOD, I bless thee for all the Good, which thou didst employ me to do for these thy Chosen Ones!</HI> A Satisfaction and a Consolation, beyond what any Tongue may declare, or any Heart conceive! —</P></Q>
<P>All this is done, as the Reporter of the like Usages among the more ancient Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> expresses it, <HI>Spectante et plerunque illacry∣mante populo;</HI> before a <HI>Bochim</HI> of well-affected Christians.</P>
<P>A Pertinent <HI>Psalm</HI> (such as the XXIII; or part of the LXVIII; or part of the CXXXII.) is now sung; appointed by the <HI>new Pastor;</HI> who then pronounces the usual <HI>Blessing</HI> with which the Assembly is dismissed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> with other Strangers of Note re∣tire, according to a Direction then given; where (to use the Words of the <HI>Bohemian Discipline</HI>) <HI>Coenatur modeste, cum Timore Domini, piis et amicu Colloquiis.</HI></P>
<P>For these things the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> have no <HI>Forms</HI> among them; and being well established in the <HI>Things</HI> they find the less want of any <HI>Forms.</HI> They are instructed &amp; united in the <HI>Substance,</HI> and their not being tied unto
<PB N="41" REF="002775_0056_0FE63066EC0E32C0"/><HI>Forms,</HI> does but give them the <HI>Delight</HI> of the more <HI>Variety,</HI> in Expressions and in Circumstan∣ces. They may say, as <HI>Comenius</HI> of the Rites in the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Churches

<P>§. 10. In some Churches of the Reformation, (bordering upon <HI>Suitzerland</HI>) the People, after the public Performances of a Candidate have recommended him to them, Chuse him for their Pastor; Whereupon the Minister only preaches an <HI>Ina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guration-Sermon,</HI> and so without any further Ceremonies of <HI>Ordination,</HI> goes on with the Ex∣ercise of his Ministry.

<P>§. 11.

<P>§. 1. A <HI>Church</HI> is thus furnished with a <HI>Pastor;</HI> And sometimes with <HI>more than one;</HI> In which Case, One of them formerly was dis∣tinguished by the Name of a <HI>Teacher:</HI> Tho' in regard of their <HI>Work,</HI> and their <HI>Power,</HI> among these
<PB N="43" REF="002775_0058_0FE6306CC9ACD650"/>Churches, it has been so much <HI>Distinctio sine Dif∣ferentia,</HI> that more lately the Distinction is less regarded. And their being mentioned so <HI>together,</HI> as they are in the sacred Oracles (Eph. IV. 12.) is pleaded for little short of an <HI>Identity</HI> between them. Let us now see, how he endeavours to <HI>irradiate</HI> the House of GOD, when he is thus fixed in the <HI>Golden Candlestick.</HI></P>
<P>Every LORD's DAY, the Congregation meets <HI>twice;</HI> and so hath both a <HI>Morning</HI> and an <HI>Evening Sacrifice.</HI> These are as <HI>Tertullian</HI> says of the like in his Time, <HI>Dominica Solennia, The Lord's Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Solemnities.</HI></P>
<P>§ 2. As these Churches, have the Incontesti∣ble Judgment and Practice of the Primitive; (di∣rected by the Spirit of GOD who calls the <HI>first Day of the Jewish Week,</HI> Rev. I 10. <HI>The LORD's Day,</HI>) harmonizing with them in their <HI>Sabbatiz∣ing</HI> on the <HI>Lord▪s Day;</HI> and may say that which <HI>Dimysius</HI> of <HI>Corinth</HI> wrote unto the Church of <HI>Rome, This Day being the Lord's Day, we keep it Holy.</HI> And as their Judgment and Practice is ac∣cording to that in <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria; A true Christian according to the Commands of the Gospel, observes the</HI> Lord's Day, <HI>by casting out all evil Tho'ts, and entertaining all good Ones, glorifying the Resur∣rection of the Lord on that Day.</HI> So they keep up the Term of, <HI>The LORD's Day:</HI> and look upon it as an abuse to call it, <HI>Sunday:</HI> Though the Day being the <HI>Christian Sabbath,</HI> it is as frequently called, <HI>The Sabbath,</HI> and, <HI>The Sabbath Day,</HI> among them. There is an unhappy Passage in the <HI>Rhe∣mish</HI> and <HI>Romish</HI> Annotations upon the New Tes∣tament, concerning the Protestants; <HI>While they
<PB N="44" REF="002775_0059_0FE6306F370330E0"/>say,</HI> Ministers, <HI>let us say,</HI> Priests; <HI>when they call it a</HI> Communion Table, <HI>let us call it an</HI> Altar; <HI>Let us keep our Old Words, and we shall keep our Old Things.</HI> But then, these <HI>Rhemish</HI> Annotators themselves, condemn the Name of <HI>Sunday</HI> as <HI>Heathenish.</HI> The Churches are sensible, That the <HI>Pagans</HI> first called this Day by the Name of <HI>Sun∣day,</HI> and that it was a stroke of their <HI>Idolatry</HI> to call it so; it was to express the Dedication of the Day unto the oldest and brightest <HI>Idol</HI> in the World. Though they let the <HI>Planetary Names</HI> for the other Days stand in their present Indiffer∣ency, (however no better a Man then <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> complains of <HI>that!</HI>) nevertheless, they in∣cline to think, that the <HI>Third</HI> Commandment as well as the <HI>Fourth,</HI> obliges them to allow unto the <HI>Lord's Day</HI> the Name which <HI>He</HI> has himself chal∣lenged for it. They are not ashamed of Con∣fessing their LORD, or of Confessing that this <HI>Day</HI> belongs to him. 'Tis true, some of the Ancients, as both <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> and <HI>Tertullian,</HI> do sometimes in their <HI>Apologies,</HI> call the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Sunday:</HI> But there is this to be <HI>Apologized</HI> for them, That they directed their <HI>Apologies</HI> unto the <HI>Pagans,</HI> who would not have readily understood another Name. And then that the Churches may not be thought <HI>more nice than wise</HI> in this Matter, they can quote from the great <HI>Ambrose</HI> a Passage of that Import, <HI>The Day which is called</HI> The Lord's Day, <HI>in the Church, is called</HI> Sunday <HI>by the Men of the World.</HI> And then the greater <HI>Austin</HI> hath shown them, That the <HI>Manichees</HI> in those Days, rather than the <HI>Christians,</HI> called the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> by the Name of
<PB N="45" REF="002775_0060_0FE6306F3B042B68"/><HI>Sunday:</HI> But adds, <HI>for our Parts we call it the</HI> Lord's Day, <HI>because on it, we Reverence not the Sun, but the Resurrection of the Lord.</HI> And they find him elsewhere very earnest for the <HI>Heathen Name</HI> to be laid aside; saying, <HI>'Tis a manner of speaking that becomes not a Christian Mouth.</HI> They remem∣ber also, that <HI>Philastrius</HI> would have the Use of that Name with Christians reckoned little short of <HI>Heretical.</HI></P>
<P>§. 3. The <HI>Hours</HI> taken for the two Meetings on the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> are such as they Judge may most suit their Edification. Where any Number of the <HI>People</HI> have their living very remote from the <HI>Meeting-House,</HI> the Time of Intermission be∣tween the two Meetings is usually shortned for their sake; and they stay <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI> it. But how do they spend this Time? The more faithful and watchful <HI>Pastors,</HI> are put upon using their best Contrivances, that their Employments may be most agreeable, and most serviceable to the Interests of <HI>Holness.</HI> It has been proposed, That <HI>Repetitions</HI> of, or <HI>Conferences</HI> on, the <HI>Word of Christ</HI> may be some of the Employments.</P>
<P>§. 4. The <HI>Pastor</HI> (after the <HI>Bills</HI> which any of the Neighbours put up, desiring a Remembrance in the publick <HI>Prayers</HI> or <HI>Praises,</HI> on their special Occasions, have been Read) begins with PRAYER.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Man</HI> whom <HI>Chrysostom</HI> counted it his Happiness to hear <HI>Praying</HI> before Sermon with pertinent <HI>Petitions</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> did <HI>say nothing</HI> (as he says) <HI>before these Prayers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002775_0061_0FE630767A24A4C0"/>
<HI>Basil</HI> tells, The <HI>President,</HI> going up to <HI>Teach in the Pulpit,</HI> first made sure of <HI>Prayers, That by the Grace of Christ, the Good Spirit might mercifully direct their Minds in the Way of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>The Martyr <HI>Cyprian</HI> made <HI>Prayers</HI> for himself and his Auditors, as well as <HI>brought Words which he fetched from the Fountains of the Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>The holy <HI>Austin</HI> advised all <HI>Doctors</HI> to <HI>pray,</HI> be∣fore <HI>they gave their Tongue the Liberty to preach.</HI> And he practiced accordingly.</P>
<P>Thus, 'tis <HI>Prayer</HI> that begins the publick Ex∣ercises in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>They have no LITURGY <HI>composed</HI> for them; and much less have they any <HI>imposed</HI> on them. The <HI>Pastors</HI> reckon, that the Representation of their Peoples Condition in <HI>Prayers,</HI> with fit <HI>Ex∣pressions of their own chusing,</HI> is a necessary <HI>Gift</HI> and <HI>Work</HI> of the Evangelical Ministry. They seek the <HI>Gift;</HI> They do the <HI>Work;</HI> and with a great <HI>Variety</HI> (ordinarily) every <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> they pre∣sent before the Lord, the Condition of their Congregations in their <HI>Adapted Supplications.</HI> In these their Supplications, when they have ac∣knowledged the Glorious <HI>Perfections</HI> of the Infi∣nite GOD, and mentioned the <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> which the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> invites them to take notice of, and which perhaps the <HI>Subject</HI> they are anon to handle does lay before their more particular Notice, they pass on to <HI>Intercession and giving of Thanks for all Men; For Kings and for all in Authority,</HI> and for others, and every thing, <HI>as the Matter may require.</HI> It seems evident unto them, That the <HI>Praying in</HI> (or <HI>by) the Holy Spirit,</HI> men∣tioned in the sacred Oracles, was not meerly a Gift
<PB N="47" REF="002775_0062_0FE63076829F5748"/><HI>Miraculous</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> or a thing to cease in after Ages; Because the Apostle exhorts <HI>All Christians</HI> to exercise it; which how could they do, if they had it <HI>not?</HI> Or, if they <HI>all</HI> might have it, how was it <HI>Miraculous</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary?</HI> Our Pastors by <HI>blowing up the Flame</HI> of the <HI>Gift,</HI> at∣tain to such Measures of it, that their Flocks apprehend a <HI>Liturgy</HI> would be a sensible Injury unto them.

<Q>There may be too great a Re∣straint put upon Men, whom GOD and Na∣ture hath distinguished by blessing them with an Happy Talent, and giving them not only good Sense, but a powerful Utterance too, has enabled them to gush out upon the Attentive Auditory, with a mighty Stream of Devout and Unaffected Eloquence. When a Man so qualified, endued with Learning too, and a∣bove all adorned with a good Life, breaks out into a Warm and Well-delivered <HI>Prayer</HI> before his Sermon, it has the Appearance of a <HI>Divine Rapture;</HI> He raises and leads the Hearts of the Assembly, in another manner than the most Composed, or best Studied <HI>Form of set Words</HI> can ever do; and the <HI>Pray wee's</HI> who serve up all their Sermons with the same Gar∣nishing, would look like so many <HI>Statues,</HI> or

<P>The Churches count it good Sense and very Reasonable, That the Ministers of the Gospel who submit their Capacities and Abilities to a due <HI>Trial,</HI> should enjoy the <HI>Liberty,</HI> which was confessedly left us by our Saviour, and His A∣postles; who never provided any <HI>Prayer Book</HI> but the <HI>Bible</HI> for us. They believe, that our Saviour and His Apostles knew the Necessities of His Churches; and they are afraid of any <HI>Inventi∣ons,</HI> that may carry in them the least Reproach upon His Infinite <HI>Wisdom.</HI> They believe, That our Enthroned JESUS, has promised unto or∣dinary Officers in His Churches, <HI>until the End of the World,</HI> a Continuance of sufficient <HI>Gifts,</HI> to discharge their Offices. They believe, That if there be found a <HI>Decay of Gifts</HI> in the Churches, the Remedy must be for Christians to return unto Him, who has chastised their <HI>Slothfulness,</HI> their <HI>Carnality,</HI> their <HI>Apostacy,</HI> with a withdraw of His <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> from them; and not by find∣ing out an <HI>unhappy Expedient,</HI> that should rather confirm them in the lamentable Condition, into which they are fallen. <HI>Reader,</HI> This is the <HI>New English Puritanism!</HI> And as far as they can learn, they have the Practice of the <HI>Primitive Churches</HI> to countenance them in it.

<P>Indeed, We are not ignorant, That the <HI>Pagans</HI> of old <HI>prayed by a Form.</HI> In their publick Prayers, they had a <HI>Monitor,</HI> who did <HI>praeire Preces de scrip∣to.

ΕΚ ΒΙΒΑΟΥ <HI>out of a Book.

But we have we been told that the Primitive <HI>Christians</HI> did not <HI>pray so.</HI> For this they will not insist on <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s famous Passage of their praying <HI>sine Monitore, quia de Pectore;</HI> tho' even from thence, Bp. <HI>Bilson</HI> concludes, <HI>That free Prayer was then used;</HI> and Bp. <HI>Hall</HI> concludes, <HI>That the Mode of Praying was not then under any superiour Injunction:</HI> They can give up this <HI>Tertullianic</HI> Passage, and find <HI>A∣pology</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="002775_0066_0FE630799710C900"/>enough to plead for them in others of the Ancients: Particularly, in <HI>Origen,</HI> who relates, That both in the <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Churches, which divided the whole <HI>Evangelized World</HI> be∣tween them, they prayed every one
ΩΣ ΑΥΝΑΤΑΙ, <HI>as he was able.</HI> Arch Bishop <HI>Usher</HI> has given us Assurance, That the <HI>Irish</HI> Churches for Eleven Hundred Years, and the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Scotish,</HI> if not so long, yet long after <HI>Austin,</HI> the Monk, retain∣ed such a <HI>Liberty</HI> herein, as was of old enjoyed in all Quarters of the World. Nor did the old <HI>Hebrews</HI> know any such Thing as a <HI>stated Form of Prayer;</HI> In these Churches 'tis thought so, be∣cause of certain Words which those among them who have consulted R. <HI>Bechai,</HI> do from him quote unto them, <HI>Thou mayest do well to know</HI> (saith the Rabbi) <HI>that from the Times of</HI> Moses <HI>our Master, to the Times of the</HI> Great Sanhedrim, <HI>there was no usual and equal form of Prayer in Israel; because every one made his Prayer for himself, accord∣ing to his own Knowledge, and Wisdom, and Utter∣ance.</HI> Indeed at this Day, they have a <HI>Liturgy:</HI> but they have a <HI>Tradition</HI> that the Christians have theirs from <HI>Armillus:</HI> that is to say, — Every one knows, <HI>Who?</HI></P>
<P>Conformable then to the Best Antiquity are the Churches of <HI>New-English</HI> Nonconformists. The most likely way to bring such a <HI>Novelty</HI> as a <HI>Liturgy</HI> into request among them, would be; for the <HI>Churches</HI> first of all to sink into so bad, a State, as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> complains they began to be in his Time, <HI>Like Houses burnt down, by having taken Fire, with all the Pillars that have supported them;</HI> Or, for their <HI>Pastors</HI> first of all to degene∣rate
<PB N="52" REF="002775_0067_0FE6307D70C78C80"/>into the Barbarous Darkness of those Ages, when the <HI>Bishops</HI> assembled in <HI>Councils</HI> were so <HI>Illiterate,</HI> many of them, that they must get ano∣ther to subscribe their Names for them, with this Confession annexed, <HI>Propterea quod Literas ig∣norem,</HI> and when they ordained (as did <HI>Eusebius</HI> of <HI>Pelusium</HI>) ΑΠΑΙΔΕΥΣΙΑΣ ΘΡΕΜΜΑΤΑ ΚΑΙ ΔΑΙ ΜΟΝΑΣ ΑΛΑΣΤΟΡΑΣ.</P>
<P>§. 5. The former and larger <HI>Prayer</HI> of the Pas∣tor being finished, then (as <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells us how in his Time, <HI>Psalmi canuntur</HI>) a PSALM usually succeeds. In some the Assembly being furnished with <HI>Psalm-Books,</HI> they sing without the stop of Reading between every Line.</P>
<P>But ordinarily the <HI>Psalm</HI> is read line after line, by him whom the Pastor desires to do that Ser∣vice; and the People generally sing in such <HI>grave Tunes,</HI> as are most usual in the Churches of our Nation. <HI>Basil</HI> thus mentions the order in the Primitive Churches. First <HI>Praying,</HI> and then <HI>Singing.</HI></P>
<P>It is manifest from <HI>Tertullian,</HI> that in the Pri∣mitive Churches, the Christians used not only <HI>Hymns</HI> collected out of the sacred Scripture, but such as were conceived and composed by them∣selves; <HI>Ut quisque de Scriptura, vel de proprio Inge∣nio potest, provocatur in medium Deo canere. Socrates</HI> mentions the <HI>Psalms</HI> written by <HI>Chrysostom;</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> the <HI>Psalms</HI> written by <HI>Nepos.</HI> Nor was it otherwise in the <HI>Bohemian</HI> Churches, of the later Ages, where they were provided with a <HI>Cantional,</HI> of above Seven Hundred and Forty
<PB N="53" REF="002775_0068_0FE6307D764B1410"/><HI>sacred Songs,</HI> besides the <HI>Davidical Psalms.</HI> But the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> admit not into their Publick Services, any other than the <HI>Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, of the Old and New Tes∣tament, faithfully translated into English Metre.</HI> No, not so much as the, <HI>Te Deum;</HI> An Hymn which indeed is not mentioned by any Author more Ancient than the <HI>Rules</HI> which old <HI>Benet</HI> wrote for his <HI>Monks,</HI> about the middle of the Sixth Century. Nor, <HI>The Song of the Three Children,</HI> an Hymn everywhere unmentioned until the Fourth Council of <HI>Toledo,</HI> in the Seventh. In this thing they agree to the Act of the <HI>Laodicean</HI> Synod, <HI>That no private Psalms be used in the Church.</HI> And they almost confine themselves unto the Limita∣tions enjoined by the first Synod of <HI>Bracara, Let nothing be Sung in the Church, but the Psalms of the Old Testament</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Extra Psalmos Veteris Testamenti, nihil poetice compositum in Ecclesia Psallatur.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And if <HI>Austin</HI> cou'd blame the <HI>Donatists,</HI> for leaving of the <HI>Psalms</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> and singing <HI>Hymns</HI> of their own Invention, 'tis a Point wherein the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have not been hither∣to blameable. The <HI>private</HI> Companies &amp; Families of the faithful among them, indeed have some∣times employed what <HI>Versified Portions of Scripture</HI> and other devout <HI>Hymns</HI> they find for their Edi∣fication.</P>
<P>But when they <HI>Bless GOD in their Congregations,</HI> they keep to such <HI>Psalms,</HI> as a <HI>Theodoret</HI> mentions as preferrible in the Judgment of several of the Ancients, above <HI>any others:</HI> That is to say, Those
<PB N="54" REF="002775_0069_0FE63083A2EE7588"/>in our <HI>sacred Psalter,</HI> and some other Poetical Pa∣ragraphs, of the <HI>sacred Scriptures</HI> Versified.</P>
<P>The first Planters of <HI>New-England,</HI> were not long without a <HI>Version</HI> of the <HI>Davidical Psalms,</HI> and of several other <HI>Songs</HI> in both Testaments, made by the united Endeavours of several Persons. In this Version, the <HI>Poetry</HI> may indeed want refin∣ing; yet the nearness &amp; closeness of the <HI>Translation</HI> unto the <HI>Original,</HI> may make some amends for o∣ther Defects. These holy <HI>Psalms</HI> by some Congrega∣tions are sung over in <HI>Order</HI> as they ly; (at least in the <HI>Psalmody</HI> for one part of the Day;) And in others, are sung, as the Minister singles them out, for to accommodate the <HI>Subjects</HI> and the <HI>De∣signs</HI> before him. How many may make <HI>Austin</HI>'s Reflection; <HI>Quantum flevimus in Hymnis suaviso∣nantis Ecclesiae!</HI></P>
<P>Their Way of <HI>Singing</HI> is not with such BOAI ATAKTOI, <HI>disorderly Clamours,</HI> as were condemned by the old Council of <HI>Trullo:</HI> But in such <HI>Grave Tunes,</HI> as are most used in our Nation; and it may be hoped, not without some Sense of that which <HI>Zonaras</HI> gives as the Reason of the <HI>Trullan</HI> Condemnation, <HI>The Singing of Psalms is a Suppli∣cating of GOD himself, wherein by humble Prayer we beg the Pardon of our Sins.</HI> Their <HI>Psalmody</HI> is nei∣ther set off with the <HI>Delicacies,</HI> which <HI>Austin</HI> complained of, nor is it rendred unseemly by the <HI>Exorbitances</HI> we find rebuked by <HI>Chrysostom.</HI> It has been commended by Strangers a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> generally <HI>not worse</HI> than what is in many other parts of the World; but rather as being usually according

ΕΜΜΕΛΩΣ ΚΑΙ ΣΥΜΦΟΝΩΣ <HI>Melodiously</HI> and <HI>Agreeably.</HI> However, of later Times they have considerably Recovered it, and Reformed, and Refined it, from some Indecen∣cies, that by length of Time had begun to grow upon it. And more than a <HI>Score</HI> of Tunes are heard <HI>Regularly Sung</HI> in their Assemblies.</P>
<P>§. 6. The SERMON follows. The <HI>Pastor</HI> proceeds to the Service which <HI>Athanasius</HI> tells <HI>Draconicus,</HI> the People expected from him, when they elected him to his Bishoprick: Even, <HI>To bring Meat out of the Doctrine of the Scriptures.</HI> The Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> though they use not the Ceremony (which was frequently used of old) of putting the <HI>Bible</HI> on the Heads of their Ministers in their <HI>Ordinations,</HI> yet they ex∣pect the <HI>Heads,</HI> and <HI>Hearts,</HI> and <HI>Lips</HI> of their Mi∣nisters to be employed in opening the <HI>Bible</HI> unto them. They approve so far of the Ancient <HI>Ca∣nons,</HI> (whereof <HI>Herald</HI> of <HI>Tours</HI> made a Capitula∣ry) <HI>That Ministers should preach to all the Faithful, the Doctrines of Faith; the Incarnation of JESUS CHRIST, His Death, and Resurrection, and Ascention; The Gift of the Holy Spirit, and the Remission of Sins.</HI> They reckon with <HI>Gregory</HI> (him who has been called, <HI>The Great) That for a Bishop to abstain from Preaching is a filthy shame, and a wicked thing, and a Token of Death.</HI> And they are of <HI>Jerem</HI>'s Mind, <HI>That no Testimony of his Virtues can profit him, if he be not able to teach the People committed to him.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, bespeaking Attention, he reads a <HI>Text,</HI> longer or shorter, as he pleases, from the <HI>sacred Scriptures,</HI> and then makes a <HI>Sermon</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="002775_0071_0FE630869BF856E0"/>(which the Ancients called a <HI>Treatise</HI>) thereup∣on; or, to speak in the Style of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI>
<Q>After the Writings of the Prophets and Apos∣tles, the Minister makes an Oration, wherein he instructs the People, and exhorts them to the Imitation of such excellent Things.</Q> Or, in the Style of <HI>Origen.</HI>
<Q>What is read being Ex∣plained, he excites the People to Piety towards the Blessed GOD, and other Virtues, the in∣separable Companions of Piety.</Q></P>
<P>In doing this necessary part of his Office, be∣ing <HI>bound</HI> (as <HI>Hilary</HI> well says) <HI>to serve the Church in Preaching the Gospel,</HI> he gives himself a Liberty, either to Preach over the <HI>Body of Divinity</HI> in or∣der, (a Practice of unknown Advantage to the <HI>Preacher,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> To preach over certain <HI>paragraphs of the Bible;</HI> Or, To handle such <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Cases,</HI> as he may judge most necessary; Or, To accommodate himself unto <HI>special Occasions,</HI> that should have such a No∣tice taken of them; and particularly the <HI>Sacra∣mental.</HI> Nor are the Pastors of <HI>New-England</HI> al∣together insensible of what is well observed by our Doctor <HI>Owen;</HI>
<Q>That the Work of the Mi∣nistry is not by any means more evacuated, and rendred ineffectual, than when Ministers have not a certain Design to deal with their Hearers according to what they are perswaded, that their Spiritual State requires. A general Preaching at Random, without a special Scope, directed by such a Perswasion, turns the whole Work, for the most part, both in Preachers, and Hearers, into a useless Formality.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="002775_0072_0FE63086A0050580"/>
The <HI>Tractators</HI> (as the <HI>Preachers</HI> were called) in the <HI>Primitive Churches,</HI> did often use to <HI>sit</HI> in their Exercises. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> we find still doing so; Tho' <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> rebukes the Heighth and Pride of the Thrones in which the more superci∣lious Bishops of those Times (and such as the Council of <HI>Antioch</HI> did rebuke <HI>Samosatenus</HI> for) did Seat themselves. But in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> the Pastors do <HI>stand</HI> when they Preach; and (otherwise than in the Churches of the <HI>French</HI> Protestants) They <HI>stand unco vered.</HI></P>
<P>The Length of a <HI>Sermon</HI> among them, is very much like the Length of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tractate</HI> among the Ancients. <HI>Jerom</HI> admo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>shed <HI>Austin,</HI>
<Q>That he should not be too long least the Sermon being too long dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, should not be well com∣prehended. <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> remarked 'That Satiety in a Sermon was no less an Enemy to the Ear, than too much meat to the Body.</Q> <HI>Basil</HI> would therefore
<Q>End his Morning Sermon the sooner, least he should make his Hearers dull against the Evening Assembly.</Q> And <HI>Chry∣sostom</HI> compared the People to <HI>Infants,</HI> which were to have their Meat by <HI>little and little</HI> instil∣led into them; for which Cause, he says,
<Q>Care was taken that the Teachers should neither weary themselves, nor the Hearers, with a Multitude of Words.</Q> Accordingly they gene∣rally limited themselves unto <HI>about an Hour.</HI> Wherefore both <HI>Basil</HI> and <HI>Austin</HI> we find some∣times declining to speak, <HI>What they could not finish in the space of an Hour.</HI> And <HI>Chrysostom</HI> re∣proved those who thought much to give unto the Lord, One or Two <HI>Hours,</HI> out of an <HI>Hundred
<PB N="58" REF="002775_0073_0FE6308D0838F718"/>and Sixty Eight,</HI> of which a <HI>Week</HI> is <HI>composed.</HI> Ne∣vertheless they did not so <HI>limit</HI> themselves unto an <HI>Hour,</HI> but that if they saw Occasion, they would enlarge beyond it, and plead (as <HI>Austin</HI> did) the Exemple of <HI>Paul</HI> Preaching till Mid∣night, for their Preaching a good way into the <HI>second Hour.</HI> Much hereabouts the Sermons of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>But then the Ancients often took a Liberty for one thing, which would be in these Churches (if ever <HI>allowed</HI> upon some extraordinary <HI>Emer∣gencies</HI> unto Persons of extraordinary <HI>Abilities,</HI>) but rarely <HI>approved;</HI> They commonly Preached <HI>Ex tempore:</HI> Thus both <HI>Jerom</HI> and <HI>Ruffin</HI> agree concerning many Homilies of <HI>Origen, Has Ex tempore in Ecclesia peroravit;</HI> and, <HI>In auditorio Ecclesiae Ex tempore, non tam Explanation is quam Edi∣ficationis intentione perorata sunt.</HI> And all that we have now of <HI>Cyril</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> are, as <HI>Vossius</HI> observes, <HI>Catecheses</HI> ΣΧΕΔΙΑΣΘΕΙΣΑΣ, <HI>extemporales.</HI> Thus we find some of them, like <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> Preaching from the Psalm which happened to be sung before the Sermon. And <HI>Flavianus</HI> advised <HI>Chrysostom, To use an extemporary faculty in preaching.</HI> In Compliance with which Advice, <HI>Georgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Alexandrinus</HI> writing his Life, tells us, that the People saw him sometimes ΑΥΤΟΣΧΕΔΩΣ, <HI>Ex Tempore</HI> preaching unto them. And tho' <HI>Atticus</HI> had not the like Accomplishments of his Predecessor <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> yet <HI>Socrates</HI> tells us, that by <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> he also attained unto the Faculty of delivering himself <HI>ex Tempore</HI> unto his Auditory. <HI>Jerom,</HI> 'tis true, was no constant Preacher, but several of his Discourses now in
<PB N="59" REF="002775_0074_0FE6308D0E531D40"/>our Hands, were as himself tells us, <HI>Ex temporales Dictationes,</HI> taken in <HI>short Hand;</HI> And his Inter∣pretation of the Three Books of <HI>Solomon,</HI> was <HI>Tridui Opus</HI> dispatched in <HI>three Days</HI> time. <HI>Augus∣tin</HI> likewise, as <HI>Erasmus</HI> observes, used <HI>Extempora∣li Dictione,</HI> in his Preaching; and he judges this Father more excellent in his <HI>Extemporal Discourses</HI> than in his <HI>Elaborate;</HI> as if he had been what the Historian says of <HI>Tiberius, Ex tempore quam a Cura praestantior. Firmus</HI> the Manichee was con∣verted by one of those Discourses, and the World had not now enjoyed them, if they had not been taken, <HI>Per notarios ex Ore Loquentis.</HI> A Faculty of Preaching with <HI>little Study,</HI> has been by too many it may be endeavoured in the Churches of <HI>New-England;</HI> and there have been diverse Temptations leading to it. But <HI>well studied Sermons</HI> are those which among Judi∣cious Christians in these Churches find the best Acceptance, and are the best esteemed: The Churches do not ordinarily reckon it a Com∣mendation for their Ministers, <HI>e Manicis Concio∣nem excutere.</HI> If they hear of Ministers boasting that they have been in their Studies, only a few Hours on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> or so, they reckon that such Persons rather <HI>Glory in their shame. Sudden Sermons,</HI> they may sometimes admire from their accomplished Ministers, when the <HI>suddenness</HI> has not been a <HI>chosen Circumstance;</HI> But as one of old, when it was objected against his publick Speeches (in Matters of less Moment than the <HI>Salvation of Souls) That they were studied,</HI> replied,
<Q>I should blush at the Incivility of treating so great and wise a People, with any thing but what shall
<PB N="60" REF="002775_0075_0FE6308EDC545D78"/>be <HI>studied</HI>

<P>However as the Ancients did not content themselves on the <HI>Lord's Days</HI> without <HI>preaching twice,</HI> which diverse Passages in the <HI>Homilies</HI> of others besides <HI>Basil,</HI> do demonstrate, no more do the Pastors of these Churches; who, as 'twas said of <HI>Basil,</HI> by their Sermons,
<Q>Bring first Morning Food, and then Evening Joy to their Hearers: And as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> speaks, 'Being wearied with the Labours of the Forenoon-Service, reserve the Rest until the After∣noon.</Q> Indeed, they do not, as diverse of the Ancients, preach <HI>every Day. Austin</HI> sometimes did it; <HI>Cyprian</HI> sometimes did it; <HI>Alexander,</HI> as <HI>Nicephorus</HI> affirms, did it. And so did <HI>Calvin</HI> a∣mong the Moderns. Neither the Pastors nor the People, in the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> can attend so frequent Opportunities of Publick Preaching. Nevertheless, the frequency of Opportunities to Preach, has been very Great unto some <HI>New-English</HI> Divines. There have been of them able to speak in Terms like those of <HI>Chrysestom,</HI>
<Q>I have spoken to Day, and Yes∣terday, and the Day before yesterday, and shall speak To-morrow.</Q> They have preached no less than <HI>five Days</HI> together; yea, more than <HI>twice five Days</HI> together, and more than <HI>once</HI> on some of those Days, and unto <HI>Great Au∣ditories.</HI> And it has been thought by some, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="61" REF="002775_0076_0FE6308EE0496180"/>Preaching <HI>often</HI> has but the better disposed them unto <HI>often</HI> Preaching; As an Oven lately heated, needs less Fuel to heat it over again.</P>
<P>It is well known, how the Custom of <HI>Preaching with Notes</HI> came to be taken up in our <HI>Nation.</HI> It was very little <HI>Practiced</HI> or <HI>Approved</HI> in <HI>This Country,</HI> till of later Years: But it is now be∣come extremely Fashionable: And no doubt some Sermons are the better <HI>Composed</HI> for it, tho' it will require good Management if they be not the less <HI>Affecting.</HI> Indeed, it is no new Thing, for as eloquent Speakers as <HI>Augustus</HI> him∣self, (who began the Custom) to have Minutes of their Speeches before them: And <HI>Cicero</HI> him∣self did sometimes, <HI>De Scripto dicere.</HI> Yea, <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us, <HI>Orationes, et nostri quidam, et Graeci Lectita∣verunt.</HI> There are Ministers in the Country, who still <HI>Preach without Notes</HI> before them; and their Performances are justly and greatly esteem∣ed. But, — <HI>Apparent Rari</HI> — And many Mi∣nisters who have their Notes before them, yet speak with so much Vigour and Fervour, that their Hearers do not think themselves <HI>unspoken</HI> to. The Severity of some <HI>Foreign Churches</HI> utterly <HI>For∣bidding all preaching with Notes,</HI> is not exercised in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> And yet it seems to be <HI>generally wished,</HI> That the Preachers would keep to such a <HI>middle Way</HI> in it, as not thereby to lose or blunt, the Vivacity of their Delivery; but, as it has been sometimes express'd, <HI>Cast</HI> their Eye upon the <HI>Quiver,</HI> for the Arrow to be fetch∣ed from thence, and yet not keep it entirely <HI>fixed</HI> on the <HI>Quiver,</HI> all the while the Arrow is deliver∣ing.</P>

§. 7. The <HI>Sermon</HI> being finished, the Pastor makes a <HI>shorter Prayer,</HI> wherein he recommends the Sermon, and the principal Documents of it, unto the Operations of the Holy Spirit for the effectual Applications thereof unto the Hearts of the People.</P>
<P>Then, (at least in the <HI>Afternoon</HI>) there is a∣nother Psalm sung.</P>
<P>In some of the Congregations, they have also on the Afternoon of the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> before the latter <HI>Psalm,</HI> a COLLECTION, according to the Apostolical Direction, 1 Cor. XVI. 2. <HI>Upon the first Day of the Week, let every one of you, lay by him in Store, as GOD has prospered him.</HI> The Pri∣mitive Churches also did it, in the Days of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> and of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> as the Writings of those, and others in that Age, assure us. And the <HI>Ec∣clesiastical Expences</HI> of the Churches, are defrayed, or at least, assisted, out of these <HI>Contributions.</HI></P>
<P>§. 8. In the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> it would be thought a <HI>Disorderly thing,</HI> if in the Time of the publick Service, any Gentleman should get a Minister, to carry on a <HI>private Ser∣vice</HI> in his Family, or with any of the Neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P>It may be added, That tho' the <HI>Communicants</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> are not con∣stantly tied unto their own Pastors, yet if they should not Ordinarily hear them, when they are able to do it, the Omission would be thought a <HI>Disorder.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, That Custom of Persons falling to their <HI>Private Prayers</HI> at their first coming into
<PB N="63" REF="002775_0078_0FE63097A601D7D8"/>the Assembly, in the time of <HI>publick Worship,</HI> is in these Churches, neither practiced, nor ap∣proved. So far as it openly proclaims a <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>singular</HI> Devotion, it is condemned as a <HI>Pharisaical Ostentation.</HI> So far as the <HI>Holiness of Places</HI> is the Ground therein gone upon, the <HI>Principle</HI> is disowned. So far as it interferes with <HI>other Ordinances</HI> then managing, it is accounted such a Diversion as puts a <HI>Disrespect</HI> upon them. It is reckoned a <HI>Vanity,</HI> that a Christian cannot have his Devout Ejaculations, without signaliz∣ing them unto the Notice of his Neighbours. And they Concur with what our <HI>Clarkson</HI> and other Divines have offered; <HI>That this is against the Apostles Rule for the Regulation of publick Assem∣blies,</HI> in 1 Cor. XIV. 40. <HI>Let all things be done de∣cently and in order.</HI></P>
<P>§. 9. These are the more <HI>stated Exercises</HI> of e∣very <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> (and the <HI>Lectures</HI> on the <HI>Week Days</HI> imitate them) in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> When these are dispatched, the Pastor dismisses the Congregation with pronouncing a <HI>Benediction;</HI> wishing, <HI>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Love of GOD, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit to be with them all.</HI> 'Tis often prae∣fixed with a, <HI>Blessed are all they that hear the Word of GOD and keep it.</HI> Sometimes there is also spe∣cified the <HI>Obedience of Faith,</HI> unto the <HI>main Doc∣trine</HI> insisted on in the foregoing Sermon.</P>
<P>§. 10. It has been enquired by many excellent Persons; <HI>Whether the publick Reading of the whole Scripture in order, to our Congregations without preach∣ing
<PB N="64" REF="002775_0079_0FE63098AAAEC5E8"/>thereon, be not an Ordinance, the Omission whereof is culpable among us?</HI> It must be confessed, That the Practice has not been so generally taken up, as many have wished for. And that the thing may be fairly represented, Those who have hi∣therto continued in the Omission have pleaded;
<Q><HI>That</HI> they could not at present see either <HI>Precept</HI> or <HI>Pattern</HI> for the <HI>Reading of the Scriptures</HI> in our <HI>Churches,</HI> without <HI>Exposition</HI> upon it;</Q> nor does it seem to belong unto the Work of a <HI>Pastor:</HI>
<Q><HI>That,</HI> in every Sermon duely composed, a con∣siderable Portion of the <HI>Scripture</HI> is <HI>read,</HI> with the Advantage of its being reserred unto its <HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Use</HI> in Divinity: <HI>That,</HI> for those who are <HI>Gifted that way</HI> to go over greater or lesser <HI>Paragraphs of Scripture,</HI> with <HI>Expository Lectures</HI> upon them, is a thing much to be desired: but the <HI>Gifts</HI> of some Persons may be more profitably employed in <HI>another Way</HI> handling the Word of GOD: <HI>That,</HI> there are <HI>some Chap∣ters</HI> of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> which perhaps may not be so proper to be <HI>read publickly</HI> in our Congrega∣tions; And finally, <HI>That</HI> we should be wary, how we introduce into the Congregations an Exercise which may at all invite <HI>private Christi∣ans,</HI> to neglect any of their Duties in their <HI>private Families;</HI> whereof that of <HI>Reading the Scriptures</HI> is one.</Q></P>
<P>On the other side, There is no Name held in greater Veneration, than that of the Memorable JOHN COTTON, in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> which yet will not build on any <HI>Foun∣dation</HI> but that of the APOSTLES. This emi∣nent
<PB N="65" REF="002775_0080_0FE63098AE94BA78"/>Person, in a Book about <HI>Singing of Psalms,</HI> Printed in the Year, 1647. over and over again, does insist upon it, <HI>That the very Reading of the Scriptures, tends to Edification, as being an Ordinance of GOD; and the Expounding and Applying of them by the Spiritual Gifts of Ministers, is another Ordi∣nance.</HI> He does insist upon it, <HI>The very Reading of them is an Ordinance of GOD; and no Ordinance of GOD is empty, and beggarly and destitute of the Spirit: which is the Vanity of Mens Traditions, and may not be imputed to any of GOD's Ordinances.</HI> Deut. XXXI. 11, 12, 13. XXVII. 14. to 26.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Custom of <HI>Reading the Scrip∣ture</HI> without <HI>Explication</HI> and <HI>Exhortation</HI> upon it, is practised in many of our Churches. They look upon such an <HI>Exercise of Piety,</HI> to be an <HI>Or∣dinance</HI> of GOD, and a proper Expression of the <HI>Respect</HI> which we owe unto His <HI>Lively Oracles;</HI> In our <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> also, <HI>The Reading of the Scriptures</HI> is distinctly mentioned, with, <HI>Preaching and Hearing the Word of GOD,</HI> as parts of <HI>Religious Worship;</HI> And they think, they cannot without it, vindicate our Churches from the Imputation, which some who differ from them will cast upon them for the Omission of it.</P>
<P>It is also true, That in many of the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> the Work of Reading is not assigned unto the Pastors; They as well as the Primi∣tive, have other, to be the Readers. But none of our <HI>Pastors</HI> think themselves too considerable, to be the <HI>Readers</HI> of the <HI>Letters</HI> which our Glo∣rious LORD, has in His Bible sent unto His <HI>Creatures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="002775_0081_0FE6309A82238FC8"/>
The Churches which yet omit this Exercise, do speak of it still with a becoming <HI>Reverence;</HI> but many seem to wish, that it may have an <HI>Ex∣position</HI> or <HI>Application</HI> still attending of it. They have been informed by <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> That in the <HI>Christian</HI> Assemblies of the Primitive Times, <HI>Interpretation</HI> usually followed upon <HI>Reading the Scriptures.</HI> In <HI>Origen</HI>'s Time, we find the Ser∣mons were <HI>Explanations of the</HI> ΑΝΑΓΝΩΣΜΑΤΑ, or, the <HI>Readings.</HI> Tho' in <HI>Cyprian's</HI> Time, There was a <HI>Reader</HI> distinct from the <HI>Presbyter,</HI> yet from the Name of <HI>Doctor Audientium</HI> then put upon him, some learned Men conclude, that even <HI>he</HI> did more than barely <HI>Read.</HI> Tho' in <HI>Austin</HI>'s Time, they commonly had <HI>Three Lections,</HI> yet we find the Minister still <HI>Preached</HI> upon them: for which Cause we find some Sermons of his be∣ginning. <HI>Tres has Lectiones quas audivistis.</HI> A va∣luable Presbyterian, Mr. <HI>Boyse</HI> has let fall this Passage;
<Q>For laying aside the <HI>Exposition</HI> of what is <HI>Read,</HI> I would Recommend the excellent Words of <HI>Austin,</HI> (on 1 Johan.) where speak∣ing of the Scripture, he says, <HI>Quare legitur, si silebitur; aut quare auditur, si non exponitur?</HI></Q> And those of <HI>Bernard, (Temp.</HI> 55.)
<Q><HI>Non tradit Mater parvulo Nucem integram, sed frangit eam et Nucle∣um porrigit.</HI></Q> The Scriptures of both Testa∣ments do likewise furnish us with Intimations of something that looked that Way, in the Jewish Assemblies, (Neh. VIII. 8. Luk. IV. 16, 12. Acts XIII. 15. and XV 21.) The <HI>Pentateuch</HI> was di∣vided into fifty four <HI>Parashoth,</HI> or <HI>Sections,</HI> which they Dead over in the Synagogue every Year; and when <HI>Antiochus</HI> forbad the Reading of the
<PB N="67" REF="002775_0082_0FE6309A863CDCE0"/><HI>Law,</HI> they Read the like <HI>Sections</HI> of the <HI>Prophets;</HI> After which it became Customary to <HI>Read both</HI> together. But <HI>Philo</HI> tells us, when one of the <HI>Elders,</HI> does <HI>Read the Law,</HI> ΚΑΘ' ΕΚΑΣΤΟΝ ΕΞΗΓΕΙΤΑΙ, <HI>He expounds it severally.</HI> Yea, as long ago as the <HI>Babylonish Captivity,</HI> this was unquestiona∣bly one Exercise in the <HI>Holy Convocation</HI> every <HI>Sabbath-Day,</HI> that the <HI>Levites</HI> were to <HI>teach the People the</HI> (Meaning of the) <HI>Law,</HI> as well as <HI>put Incense upon the Altar,</HI> and they were to <HI>instruct Is∣rael in the Word of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Gemara</HI> has an Observation, <HI>That Reading was no Ministry.</HI> But indeed the <HI>Interpretation</HI> which after the Captivity, they insisted on, seems to be chiefly intended, for the rendring of the <HI>Scripture</HI> in the <HI>Language</HI> then <HI>Vulgarly</HI> used among them; However not only so.</P>
<P>The Result of these Considerations is, that in many Churches, the <HI>Reading of Chapters</HI> in Course, with a short <HI>Prayer</HI> for a Blessing on it, is one of the Publick <HI>Exercises;</HI> nor is any Of∣fence taken in others at them for doing so. 'Tis also by very many of the <HI>Pastors</HI> wished, that more of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> were <HI>publickly Read,</HI> with all due due Solemnity in their Assembly: Yea, the Practice obtains more and more; the most of the <HI>Pastors</HI> appear disposed for it. Be sure, To put the Term of <HI>dumb Reading,</HI> on the Read∣ing of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> without an <HI>Expository Operati∣on</HI> of the Reader upon it, is esteemed improper and indecent. If there be not a perfect <HI>Harmony</HI> in the Churches about the <HI>Manner</HI> of performing this Duty, however there is a perfect <HI>Charity;</HI> It
<PB N="68" REF="002775_0083_0FE6309EE0A7F088"/>breeds no Differences. Yea, That the <HI>Scriptures be publickly Read,</HI> in some sense, it may be said, <HI>They are all Agreed.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV. The Administration of the <HI>Sacred Baptism.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§. 1. IN the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> as well as in all other well ordered Churches, the <HI>Pastors</HI> or <HI>Teachers,</HI> (and they only) admi∣nister the <HI>Seals</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> unto those who do upon the Preaching of the Gospel ac∣cept thereof; And the <HI>Lord's Day</HI> is the usual Time for their discharging this Part of their <HI>Stewardship.</HI> So in the Days of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> we read, <HI>Non nisi in Ecclesia praepositis licuit bapti∣zare.</HI></P>
<P>§. 2. The Principle which the Churches do generally go upon, has been thus declared.
<Q>The Laws by which our SAVIOUR will have His Kingdom to be governed, are administred in the <HI>Corporations</HI> thereof. <HI>Particular Churches</HI> of Believers, associating to Worship our SAVI∣OUR in all His Ordinances, when furnished with <HI>Pastors,</HI> are such <HI>Corporations.</HI> But the Great KING has many <HI>Subjects</HI> in His <HI>Visible
<PB N="69" REF="002775_0084_0FE6309EE60E37D0"/>Kingdom,</HI> who are not yet <HI>constituent Members</HI> of the <HI>Corporations.</HI> They who openly profess the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and make Choice of the True GOD, for <HI>Their GOD,</HI> and submit unto the Laws of His Kingdom, and have nothing in their <HI>Conversation</HI> that may give a notorious Contradiction to this <HI>Profession;</HI> These are to be owned as, <HI>The People of GOD.</HI> We durst not say, There is no Difference between <HI>These</HI> and <HI>Pagans.</HI> We cannot but own <HI>These,</HI> for <HI>Subjects</HI> in the <HI>Visible Kingdom</HI> of our Glorious LORD. We cannot answer it unto GOD, or His Peo∣ple, to deny unto These, and unto the Off∣spring of these, the <HI>Baptism,</HI> with which the <HI>Subjects</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are to be Distin∣guished and Acknowledged.</Q></P>
<P>There appears a <HI>Lively Emblem</HI> of this Mat∣ter in the Constitution of the <HI>English Govern∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>But it has been said, — <HI>The Offspring of These.</HI> — The First Planters of <HI>New-England,</HI> having their Eye very much upon the Welfare of their <HI>Offspring,</HI> it can't be wondred at, if the Churches are for having their <HI>Offspring</HI> brought with them into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of their GOD. They find the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> under the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> ex∣tended unto the <HI>Offspring</HI> of the Faithful: And they have not yet seen any Scripture in the <HI>New</HI> to cut them off, or shut them out. No; But the Infants of the Faithful are there called, <HI>Holy Ones;</HI> And they think, <HI>Holy Ones</HI> ought to be <HI>Baptised,</HI> and come under a <HI>Baptismal Consecration.</HI> They do not know, That our Gracious GOD ever
<PB N="70" REF="002775_0085_0FE630A2FAE5AEB8"/>took a People into His <HI>Covenant,</HI> but He took their <HI>Offspring</HI> with them.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>The BAPTISM of the Lord, is administred in the Churches, not only unto those who <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>publickly</HI> give their Consent unto the <HI>Cove∣nant of Grace,</HI> but also to the <HI>Infants</HI> of such <HI>Vi∣sible Believers.</HI> They do not think, that in thus practising of <HI>Infant Baptism,</HI> they can be charged with departing from the Practise of the <HI>Primitive Churches. Origen</HI> expresly says, <HI>Parvuli baptizan∣tur in Remissionem Peccatorum; Little Children</HI> are <HI>baptized;</HI> Even such as he supposes to be, <HI>under three or four Years old.</HI> The Testimonies of <HI>Irenae∣us</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> for <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> are well known. And it is well known that an <HI>Affrican</HI> Council whereat Threescore and Six Bishops were pre∣sent, A. C. 254. Considering the Case, Whe∣ther <HI>Infants</HI> might be <HI>baptised,</HI> before the second or third, or eighth Day, determined the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Infants</HI> to be performed as soon as it was pos∣sible to be expected: <HI>Baptism</HI> they would have observed, <HI>Magis circa Infantes ipsos et Recens Natos,</HI> rather for <HI>new born Infants</HI> than for any.</P>
<P>§. 3. But <HI>Baptism</HI> is here, after this Manner fought for.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adult</HI> Person, first applying himself to the Pastor, the Pastor examines the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and the <HI>Belief</HI> of the Person, and obtains also, a Testimony of his <HI>Good Conversation,</HI> and there∣with perceives the Dispositions of <HI>a Saving Faith,</HI> at least <HI>hopefully begun</HI> in him.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="002775_0086_0FE630A303569D40"/>
The Person is then publickly <HI>propounded</HI> by the Pastor in the Congregation; <HI>As having offered his Desires to be received into the Covenant, and under the Government of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>A Week or two after this, if no <HI>Scandal</HI> be ob∣jected, the Pastor publickly mentions it in the Congregation; <HI>That such a one is to draw near, and receive what he has desired and sought for.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon he tenders unto the Person, the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> in Terms of This Importance.</P>
<P><Q>You, Professing a serious Belief of the Chris∣tian Religion, as it is contained in the sacred Scriptures, and usually embraced by the Faith∣ful in this Place, (and explained in our well-known Catechism;) do give up your self to GOD, in our Lord JESUS CHRIST; Re∣solving, with His Help, to conform your Life to the Rules of that Holy Religion, as long as you Live, and Repenting of all things wherein you have transgressed those Rules of Holiness. You give up your self unto the LORD JEHOVAH, who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and receive Him, as your GOD and Portion. You give up your self unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is the Lord Jehovah, and Rely upon Him as the Head of His People in the Covenant of Grace; and as your Prophet, and Priest, and King for ever. You submit to the Laws of His King∣dom, as they are administred among this His People: And will herewith be at Pains to ob∣tain that further Preparation of the Sanctuary, which may embolden your further Approaches

<Q>Bap∣tism should not be administred any where, but in a publick Church Assembly

<P>§. 5 At the <HI>Baptism</HI> the <HI>Pastor</HI> begins with a short <HI>Prayer,</HI> consisting of Passages properly in∣troductory to the Action before him; and par∣ticularly supplicating for Assistance and Accep∣tance, in that solemn <HI>Dedication to GOD,</HI> which the Person to be <HI>baptised</HI> is now passing under.</P>
<P>It is a little surprizing to read the <HI>Liberty</HI> which many of the Ancients took, in celebrat∣ing this <HI>First Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>New Testament.</HI> Some used the Form, <HI>I baptise thee;</HI> Others, <HI>Be thou baptised;</HI> Others, <HI>This Person, or, Servant of Christ, is baptised.</HI> The <HI>Latin</HI> Churches would use the Term, <HI>Tingo,</HI> as well as <HI>Baptizo.</HI> Some used the Form, ΕΙΣΟΝΟΜΑ, others, Ε<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ΝΟΜΑΤΟΣ. With <HI>Tertullian</HI> it was, <HI>In Nomen;</HI> With <HI>Cyprian</HI> it was <HI>In Nomine;</HI> And with some, <HI>The Name,</HI> was quite left out, and it was, <HI>Into the Fa∣ther, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</HI> Yea, some
<PB N="75" REF="002775_0090_0FE630AD2A5FE298"/>were so faulty, that they did, not expresly <HI>Name,</HI> every Person in the <HI>Trinity:</HI> but only the Name of <HI>Christ,</HI> or of <HI>the Lord Jesus,</HI> or of <HI>the Lord. Basil</HI> defended this, by the Plea which <HI>Irenaeus</HI> had used before him, in the Defence of it; That the Name of <HI>One</HI> is <HI>an Acknowledgement of the whole.</HI> Agreeably whereto <HI>Theophylact</HI> affirms, <HI>That he who is baptised into the Name of JESUS CHRIST, is baptised into the Trinity; for the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are not parted.</HI> And <HI>Ambrose</HI> affirms, <HI>Qui unum dixit, Trinitatem signavit.</HI> Others there were, who tho' they ex∣pressed the <HI>Three Persons</HI> of the Godhead in the Words of our Saviour, yet enlarged upon them. It seems by <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> that such Words as these were sometimes used; <HI>In the Name of the Father of all things, and of our Lord God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, this Washing with Water is performed.</HI> And sometimes the latter Clauses were thus varied; <HI>In the Name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pi∣late, and in the Name of the Holy Spirit who by the Prophets foretold all Things, concerning Jesus, he that is to be illuminited is baptised.</HI> Briefly, they tho't a, ΤΑΥΤΟΝ ΠΡΟΣΔΙΑΝΟΙΑΝ <HI>a Conformity in Sense,</HI> to be sufficient; without confining themselves to the Words mentioned (I say <HI>mentioned,</HI> because Mr <HI>Gillespy</HI> will not let me say, <HI>prescribed,</HI>) by our Saviour.</P>
<P>But in the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> such a <HI>Liberty</HI> is neither practised nor approved. In their <HI>Baptisms,</HI> the <HI>Pastors,</HI> pouring of <HI>Water</HI> with his <HI>Hand,</HI> on the <HI>Face</HI> of the Person before him, confines himself to the Words of the Institution.
<PB N="76" REF="002775_0091_0FE630AEEBFB3378"/>Prefacing the <HI>Christian Name</HI> of the Person, [or saying, <HI>This Person</HI> (or <HI>Infant</HI>) <HI>whose Name is,</HI> [so or so,] <HI>I Baptise,</HI> or, [especially if it be an Adult Person, <HI>I baptise thee,</HI>] <HI>in</HI> [or, <HI>into</HI>] <HI>the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the <HI>Pastor</HI> annexes another short <HI>Prayer,</HI> wherein he commends the <HI>Infants,</HI> (if they be such) with their <HI>Parents,</HI> or the <HI>Persons baptised,</HI> unto the Mercies of GOD, in the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> now sealed unto them. He prays for the Mercies of the <HI>Covenant;</HI> particularly, that Application of the <HI>Blood of Sprinkling,</HI> and that Effusion of the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> and that Portion in the <HI>Resurrection of the Just,</HI> whereof <HI>Baptism</HI> is to the Faithful, <HI>a Token for Good:</HI> And such a part in the <HI>Heavenly City,</HI> as God has prepared for them to whom He will be <HI>their GOD.</HI> He subjoins Petitions, that <HI>they,</HI> (and <HI>all</HI>) may as they grow up, remember also the <HI>Duties</HI> of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> And the Petitions on this Occasion put up for the <HI>Young People</HI> of the Flock, that they may be mindful of their <HI>Baptismal Engage∣ments,</HI> and become shining Examples of <HI>Early Piety,</HI> are sometimes very flaming and Patheti∣cal.</P>
<P>Some few, instead of this latter Prayer, do give the <HI>Parents</HI> a brief <HI>Admonition</HI> to bring up their Chil∣dren in the <HI>Narture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> Be sure, if an <HI>Adult</HI> Person be <HI>baptised,</HI> an <HI>Admo∣nition,</HI> has been sometimes, thought very agreea∣bly to accompany the <HI>latter Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>§. 6. The Rite of <HI>Dipping</HI> or <HI>Plunging</HI> is not now used in the <HI>Baptisms</HI> of any Churches, ex∣cept
<PB N="77" REF="002775_0092_0FE62FFC89712510"/>some of the <HI>Antipaed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>baptist</HI> Way: Though some have used the <HI>Dipping</HI> of the <HI>Face.</HI> They apprehend, that the Lord has required no more for the External Rite of <HI>Baptism,</HI> than a <HI>Sacred Washing</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and that the <HI>Degree</HI> of this Washing is lest unto the Discretion and Conveni∣ency of His People. In <HI>Hot Countrys</HI> it might well enough be by <HI>Dipping;</HI> In <HI>Cold</HI> ones <HI>Affusion,</HI> or <HI>Aspersion</HI> may be enough; <HI>Dipping</HI> they fear would hardly keep in good Terms with the <HI>Sixth Commandment,</HI> in hazarding the Life of some Disciples; or the <HI>Third,</HI> in expecting of Miracles to keep them alive. The Proof of a <HI>Total Dipping</HI> in the scriptural Examples of <HI>Bap∣tism,</HI> does not appear so plain and full, that they should lay the <HI>whole Stress</HI> of the Sacrament up∣on it. What we read of our Saviour at His <HI>Baptism,</HI> is only, that <HI>He went up from the Water.</HI> There must be a <HI>Descent</HI> unto the side of a <HI>River;</HI> And like <HI>Solomon</HI> crowned by the side of a <HI>River,</HI> our Lord might there have the <HI>Water</HI> poured up∣on Him, without a compleat <HI>Immersion.</HI> All that can be proved of what passed between the <HI>Evan∣gelist</HI> and the <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> for the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the lat∣ter, is that they came to the <HI>Bank</HI> of a Brook, which both <HI>Jerom</HI> and <HI>Sandys</HI> represent as a ve∣ry unlikely one for an <HI>Immersion</HI> to be performed there. Indeed, the <HI>Baptisms</HI> of <HI>John</HI> did require <HI>much Water;</HI> For, while the Rites of <HI>Purification</HI> were continued among the <HI>Jews</HI> it would have been thought a Scandal for <HI>one Vessel of Water</HI> to have served successively for the <HI>baptizing</HI> of di∣verse Persons. If it were so, there were occa∣sion
<PB N="78" REF="002775_0093_0FE630B677311AC8"/>of <HI>much Water</HI> to supply, tho' but a <HI>Basin</HI> for a Person. And indeed it looks not very proba∣ble, that <HI>John</HI> stood so many <HI>whole Days</HI> toge∣ther in the <HI>Water,</HI> as he must have done, if he <HI>dipped</HI> all that he <HI>baptized</HI> in the few Months of his Ministry, which were doubtless many <HI>Thou∣sands.</HI> Yea, there are some Examples of <HI>Baptism,</HI> where the probability seems rather on the <HI>other side;</HI> that there was not an <HI>Immersion</HI> in it. Es∣pecially when we read of <HI>whole Housholds baptised</HI> in the <HI>Depth of the Night,</HI> and at a <HI>private House,</HI> where 'tis not so easy to suppose a <HI>Depth of Water</HI> for the Action. It is well known, that the <HI>Bene∣fits</HI> sealed by <HI>Baptism</HI> are set forth by <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> [1 Per. 1. 1. Isai. 1. 11. 15. Ezek. XXXVI. 25.] Now, if the thing <HI>signified,</HI> be a <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> what need the Sign be any more than a <HI>Sprinkling?</HI> And whereas there is a <HI>Baptism of the Holy Spirit,</HI> we do not read of Men's being <HI>dipped</HI> into the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> but of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> being <HI>poured</HI> up∣on them. The Word <HI>Baptize</HI> may signifie any Washing whatsoever. The <HI>Washing</HI> of no more than the <HI>Hands</HI> is called the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the <HI>Man.</HI> [Luk. XI. 38. Mar. VII. 4.] And why should not the Washing of the <HI>Face</HI> be so? Yea, we read, Heb. IX. 10. of <HI>Diverse Baptisms.</HI> And we are certain, a very great part of them were no more than <HI>Sprinklings.</HI> And indeed, none but <HI>Sprinklings</HI> are expresly mentioned in that Con∣text. Such a Mistake it is, to say, that a <HI>Sprink∣ling</HI> is not called <HI>Baptism</HI> in the holy Language. The Holy Spirit expresly calls it so. It refers especially to Numb. VIII. 7. <HI>Thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them; Sprinkle Water of Purify∣ing
<PB N="79" REF="002775_0094_0FE630B67B239660"/>upon them.</HI> Indeed, we read of being, <HI>Buri∣ed with Christ in Baptism unto Death.</HI> But it is not so much our <HI>Baptism</HI> as our <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tification,</HI> that is to resemble the <HI>Burial</HI> of our Saviour. We are by <HI>Baptism</HI> obliged unto a Conformity unto the <HI>Death</HI> of our <HI>Buried</HI> JESUS, and unto His <HI>Rising</HI> again; unto His <HI>Death,</HI> by our <HI>Dying</HI> to Sin; unto His <HI>Rising</HI> again in our <HI>Living</HI> to GOD. Our <HI>Baptism</HI> is not so much that <HI>Burial,</HI> as the Seal of our <HI>Obligation</HI> to it. <HI>Baptism</HI> is also a Sa∣crament that seals the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Faithful from their <HI>Graves,</HI> wherein we are first <HI>buried,</HI> as Christ was, and then <HI>raised</HI> like Him. Here is nothing to Intimate that in <HI>Baptism</HI> our Bodies must be all under <HI>Water.</HI> When a Man is buried he does not walk into the <HI>Grave</HI> himself, nor is he in the least active to put a Leg or a Foot in∣to the Earth. Yea, our Mode of <HI>Baptism</HI> seems more like to a <HI>Burial,</HI> than that of <HI>Plunging;</HI> For the throwing of <HI>Water</HI> on the Person is more like to the throwing of <HI>Earth</HI> upon the Dead. Some have apprehended a little Weight in this Consideration. Among the <HI>Antip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edebaptist</HI> Bre∣thren, the Person to be <HI>Baptised</HI> goes into the Water himself, to a considerable Depth, so that the Administrator does not <HI>baptize</HI> all that Part of the Body which the Person to be <HI>baptised</HI> car∣ried into the <HI>Water</HI> himself. Now no Man does <HI>baptise</HI> himself; No Action of the Person to be <HI>baptised,</HI> is any Part of the <HI>Baptism.</HI> It follows, that the <HI>Washing</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> but <HI>in Part,</HI> may be sufficient for the sacred <HI>Baptism.</HI> And, if the <HI>Washing</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> but <HI>in Part,</HI> may be sufficient for the <HI>sacred Baptism,</HI> then the Washing of the
<PB N="80" REF="002775_0095_0FE630B870915980"/><HI>Face,</HI> that Nobler and Proper <HI>Part,</HI> may be suf∣ficient.</P>
<P>It is true; <HI>Baptism</HI> was often administred in the Primitive Churches by <HI>Dipping;</HI> Yet it was not seldom administred by <HI>Sprinkling;</HI> And <HI>Cypri∣an</HI> particularly argues very much for the Suffici∣ency and Validity of such a <HI>Baptism.</HI></P>
<P>It may be added, There having been some Insinuations made unto the World, as if the <HI>Streets</HI> here were crouded with <HI>Unbaptized People,</HI> because the Churches have not such <HI>Terms of Ini∣tiation</HI> here, as are practised in <HI>other</HI> Protestant Churches, 'tis to be now declared, that this is a most unaccountable <HI>Calumny;</HI> for 'tis well known there is not one Person in all the Country free from a scandalous and notorious disqualifying <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety,</HI> but what may repair to some Hundred Ministers in these Colonies and be Baptised.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE V. The Administration of the <HI>Holy Supper.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§. 1. THE SUPPER of the Lord is not usu∣ally administred in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> but unto such as appear somewhat <HI>Confirmed</HI> in the Dispositions and Resolutions of
<PB N="81" REF="002775_0096_0FE630B874A52858"/>Christianity. They consider, That the Chur∣ches of our Lord in all Ages, and the <HI>greatest Lights</HI> in the Churches both Ancient and Mo∣dern (except such as have admitted <HI>Infants</HI> to the <HI>Eucharist</HI>) have concurred in this Principle, That <HI>Baptism</HI> is of <HI>larger Extent,</HI> than the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord, and that many within the <HI>Visible Church</HI> may have the <HI>former</HI> for their <HI>Children,</HI> while they <HI>Themselves</HI> yet want some <HI>Actual Fitness</HI> for the <HI>latter.</HI> It appears that the <HI>Baptised</HI> of old were <HI>Confirmed,</HI> before they might partake of the <HI>Holy Supper;</HI> and none was a ΤΕΛΕΙΟΣ, or <HI>Person in full Communion</HI> among some of the Primitive Churches, until he had given some <HI>Evidence</HI> of his being <HI>Sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</HI> Indeed it might not be altogether <HI>as it should be,</HI> but so <HI>it was,</HI> if we be not much mistaken in our <HI>Church History;</HI> it was no rare thing that not All, it may be not <HI>Half,</HI> it may be not one Third of them who made a <HI>Profession of the Truth,</HI> and attended upon the Preaching of the Gospel (many of whom also underwent <HI>Martyrdom</HI> itself) were ad∣mitted as <HI>compleat Members</HI> of the Church, into all Parts of its Communion; And there were sometimes but little <HI>Churches</HI> in Places that had <HI>many Christians</HI> in them.</P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> will not be censured for a <HI>Novelty</HI> of their Discipline, in their Endeavour to have their <HI>Communion</HI> as it was in <HI>Justin Martyr</HI>'s Time, when the <HI>Supper</HI> was admi∣nistred unto no Man, but one that was <HI>bapti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed,</HI> and one who Believed the <HI>Doctrines of Christianity,</HI> &amp; ΒΙΟΥΝΤΙ ΩΣ Ο ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ ΠΑΡΕΔΩΚΕΝ.
<PB N="82" REF="002775_0097_0FE630BA05597220"/><HI>One who lived according to the Laws of our SA∣VIOUR.</HI></P>
<P>Since the <HI>Reformation,</HI> 'tis well known, that the most eminent Reformers, not only in their <HI>Doctrine</HI> asserted, but also in their <HI>Practice</HI> at∣tempted, a <HI>stricter Selection</HI> of those that should be admitted unto the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> when they have been <HI>larger</HI> in the point of <HI>Baptism;</HI> and they went upon this Principle, That <HI>not all the baptised Christians, but such as might be reputed able and careful to Examine themselves, and discern the Lord's Body, are to be received unto the Supper of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>It would fill many Pages, to recite the many Passages, in the Writings of the <HI>Reformers,</HI> which countenance the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> in their Way of a <HI>stricter Selection.</HI> Two shall super∣sede all the Rest; The One shall be of a <HI>Luther∣an.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Gerhard,</HI> who says,
<Q>That not all Chris∣tians are to be admitted to the Holy Supper, but according to '<HI>Paul</HI>'s Rule, they that Exa∣mine themselves, discern the Lord's Body and shew forth the Lord's Death: All those there∣fore are excluded, who either will not, or can∣not Examine themselves.</Q> The other shall be of a <HI>Calvinist; Beza</HI> 'tis, who says,
<Q>That no one is to be admitted unto the Lord's Supper, ex∣cept he has one way or other, so given an Ac∣count of his Faith, as that the Pastor may pro∣bably gather, not only that he was born in the Church, but that he is indeed a Christian.</Q> And there are many Passages in the <HI>Confessions</HI> of the Protestant Churches abroad, which de∣clare for a <HI>special Selection</HI> of those whom they
<PB N="83" REF="002775_0098_0FE630AEEFD9A628"/>admit unto the <HI>Table of the Lord.</HI> The Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> have hitherto been thus per∣swaded; And as the famous <HI>Ursinus</HI> and <HI>Paraeus</HI> have taught them to make this Distinction; <HI>Great is the Difference between Baptism and the Supper; For Baptism is a Sacrament of Entrance, and Reception in∣to the Church; but the Supper is a Sacrament of con∣tinuance in the Church, or a Confirmation of the Re∣ception made before; And Regeneration by the Holy Spirit and Faith, or an Inclination unto Faith and Repentance sufficeth unto Baptism; but in the Supper, it required that they shew forth the Lord's Death, and Examine themselves, whether they have Faith and Re∣pentance;</HI> Thus a famous Divine of their own, Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> has thus expressed their Sense;
<Q>Baptism is the Entrance into Christ's Family; There is much more to be looked at, to make a Person capable of the Supper of the Lord; A Man must be able to Examine himself; He must not only have Grace, but growth of Grace, — so much — as to search his own Heart; and he must be able to Discern the Lord's Body.</Q> If it should be imagined, That I do the part of an <HI>Advocate,</HI> rather than of an <HI>Historian,</HI> in this Paragraph, Satisfaction may be had from Reading the <HI>Fourth</HI> of the <HI>Seven</HI> fa∣mous <HI>Propositions,</HI> concluded by a Synod of our Churches;
<Q>Adult Persons are not therefore to be admitted into full Communion, meerly be∣cause they are and continue Members, [<HI>being Baptised in their Infancy</HI>] without such further Qualifications as the Word of GOD requireth thereunto.</Q> And from Reading the large De∣fence thereof composed by Mr. <HI>Richard Mother</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="002775_0099_0FE63187EC6E5038"/>and Mr. <HI>Jonathan Mitchel,</HI> and approved by no small Assembly of the <HI>New English</HI> Ministers.</P>
<P>And yet, it must be acknowledged, that a great Part of our Pastors, even of those who can <HI>Baptise</HI> upon the Qualifications of the <HI>Synod,</HI> own, they can't see why any Adult Person should be received into the Covenant of GOD and of Grace, to obtain <HI>Baptism</HI> for themselves or theirs, of whom they cannot say, <HI>They</HI> shall immediate∣ly be welcome to the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, if they desire it; and that it must be owing unto their <HI>own declining</HI> an immediate Approach unto the Holy and Aweful Table, if it be denied unto them. All turns upon a <HI>Visible Conversion to serious PIETY.</HI></P>
<P>§. 2. Accordingly, the Usages of these <HI>Ameri∣can</HI> Churches, may be truly reported in the Words used by <HI>Origen</HI> concerning the Primitive;
<Q>After those that are converted, make such Pro∣ficiency that they appear to be sanctified by the Divine Word, and unto the utmost of their Power live in a better Manner, then at length we call them to our Mysteries.</Q> Or in those Words with which that Father Vindicates those Churches from the Reproaches of <HI>Celsus,</HI> about the Qualification of their Communicants; <HI>The Christians do</HI>
ΠΡΟΒΑΣΑΝΙΖΕΙΝ ΤΑΣΨΥΧΑΣ <HI>exquisite∣ly search the Souls of their Hearers, in order to their Admission to full Communion.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there is a <HI>Variety</HI> both of <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> upon this Matter; However it produces no trouble∣some <HI>Variance</HI> or <HI>Contention</HI> among them.</P>

Some eminent <HI>Pastors</HI> (and some of their Churches) are of the Apprehension;
<Q>That the <HI>Terms of Communion</HI> are an Ordinance of Christ, and must have a Word of <HI>Institution</HI> to Warrant them. And according to the Gospel, <HI>Ortho∣doxy</HI> in the <HI>Profession</HI> of the Truths of the Chris∣tian Religion, under which is comprized a <HI>Knowledge</HI> of these Truths, and this attended with a <HI>Conversation that becomes the Gospel of Christ,</HI> is that which is the Ground of reputing them to be <HI>Believers,</HI> and Receiving them into our <HI>Fellowship;</HI> and whatsoever more is requir∣ed as a <HI>Test,</HI> is <HI>Supra Statutum.</HI> Yet there are some things, which though not regularly <HI>Re∣quired,</HI> may without Sin be Complied withal.</Q></P>
<P>Others apprehend, That nothing short of a Probable and Credible Profession of a <HI>Justifying Faith,</HI> qualifies for the <HI>Eucharist;</HI> where the Be∣nefits of <HI>that Faith</HI> are sealed unto us: And, That in many a Man, of a <HI>Conversation</HI> free from Vice in the Opinion of the Neighbours, a good <HI>Examination</HI> may render it not <HI>probable</HI> and <HI>credi∣ble</HI> unto a <HI>Rational Charity,</HI> that he has yet attain∣ed unto a <HI>Justifying Faith.</HI> And, that therefore the <HI>Candidates</HI> of the Communion should be <HI>Ex∣amined,</HI> not only about their <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and their <HI>Belief,</HI> and a <HI>Conversation</HI> free from Scandal, but also about their <HI>Experimental Piety.</HI> Because it appears unto them the Law of Christ, That <HI>Com∣municants</HI> at the Table of the Lord, should be such as can and will <HI>Examine themselves;</HI> The Pastors thus perswaded, that they may do the part of <HI>Porters</HI> to the House of GOD, <HI>Examine</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="002775_0101_0FE5F4B9605A3230"/>those that seek Admission into the <HI>Particular Chur∣ches,</HI> and would so have the <HI>Holy Table</HI> always free to them, <HI>Whether they have Examined them∣selves; and what they find or hope upon their Self-Ex∣amination?</HI> Indeed the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the Chur∣ches hath (in their <HI>Platform</HI>) Charirably provi∣ded, <HI>That the weakest Measure of Faith is to be accepted, in those that Desire to be admitted into the Church; such Charity and Tenderness is to be used, as the weakest Christian if sincere, may not be excluded, or discouraged: Severity of Examination is to be a∣voided.</HI> According to this, that many of those who in their <HI>Adult Age,</HI> are admitted unto <HI>Bap∣tism,</HI> do not presently also come unto the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> it seems owing rather to their <HI>own chusing</HI> to stay till they are more satisfied in their <HI>Qua∣lifications,</HI> than from the Churches refusing to admit them, should they desire it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Pastor</HI> now demands a serious and sen∣sible Answer to some such <HI>Questions</HI> as these.</P>
<Q><P>What Education had you in your Younger Years? And (if Religious) what Effect had this Education?</P>
<P>Have you been thoroughly awakened ever to see the Miserable Condition, which by your Departure from GOD, you are fallen into?</P>
<P>And, What has been your Course, where your Flight, for Help under these Awaken∣ings?</P>
<P>What are the Blessings for which you re∣pair to your Admirable SAVIOUR?</P>
<P>Which Way do you hope to be Justified be∣fore the Glorious GOD?</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="002775_0102_0FE630C348B896F8"/>
What is the Sanctity, the Purity, the Piety, which will always be the Character, of the Justified Believer? And what is it You Desire and Resolve, concerning a Life of Piety?</P>
<P>Is every Sin Grievous and Odious to you? And is there no known Sin wherein you in∣dulge your self?</P>
<P>Do you in a Course of Obedience unto GOD, endeavour to express a Respect unto all His Commandments?</P>
<P>Can you Remember any special Word of GOD, by which you have been sensibly quick∣ened in Living to Him?</P>
<P>At the Table of the Lord, whereto you would now make your Approaches, what are the Outward Elements and Actions used there? And what is it that they signify?</P>
<P>What are the Preparations and the Disposi∣tions, that you would come to the Table of the Lord withal.</P>
<P>What are the Considerations that now move you to ask an Admission to the Table of the Lord?</P></Q>
<P>In the Renowned Churches of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> there was before every Celebration of the Communi∣on, an <HI>Examen Conscientiarum,</HI> wherein the Pastor examined the People, <HI>How they profited by the Means of Grace?</HI> And it is credibly Affirmed, That <HI>Luther,</HI> when he saw the Discipline of those Churches declared,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Confitebatur dolorem suum, quod ab ipsis reflorescen∣tis Evangelii primordiis, quosvis absque Discrimine ad Coenam Dominicam admisisset, quodque Disciplinam Fra∣trum Disciplinae similem apud suos non Constituisser.</NOTE> He was very sorry that the other
<PB N="88" REF="002775_0103_0FE630C34DC77740"/>Churches of the <HI>Reformation</HI> had been so Remiss in Admissions to the Communion. But in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> the Pastors do, only <HI>once</HI> for all, <HI>Examine</HI> the Spirits of the People, with pertinent <HI>Questions,</HI> before they Grant them an Admission into the <HI>State of Communicants.</HI> And herein they have not been very far from the Opinion of <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> who explaining, <HI>Holy Things for Holy Men;</HI> (A Sentence often made Use of in the Primitive Churches) has these Words,
<Q>If any one be not Holy, let him have no Access. And freedom from Wickedness does not make one Holy, but the Presence of the Spirit, and plenty of Good Works. I would have them not only free from Dirt, but also to be White, and Fair, and Beautiful.</Q></P>
<P>In very many of the Churches, the <HI>Answers</HI> of the <HI>Examined Person</HI> to some such <HI>Questions</HI> as those, are taken in Writing by the <HI>Pastor</HI> from the Mouth of the Person; [or a Brief <HI>Relation</HI> of the Desires to <HI>live unto GOD</HI> which are now working in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Heart, and of the <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Ways</HI> wherewith such Desires have been enkind∣led in him;] or else 'tis brought ready written, by the Candidate of the Communion; and unto it there is added, either a <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> of the Persons own composing, or a briefer Intima∣tion of what publickly received <HI>Confession</HI> or <HI>Ca∣techism,</HI> he chuses to acknowledge as containing the <HI>Principles of Religion,</HI> he would adhere unto. This Instrument the <HI>Pastor</HI> communicates unto <HI>Church,</HI> on some Convenient Opportunities: But sometimes he reports to the Brethren the <HI>Minutes</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="002775_0104_0FE630C6A370FB98"/>of the Satisfaction he has received from the Per∣son, who is now offered unto the Communion, without the Formality of an <HI>Address</HI> in the Name of the Person unto them, only saying, <HI>On my Inquiry he informs me</HI> so and so. 'Tis thus especially, when some Godly <HI>Scotchmen,</HI> who have scrupled the Modes of the <HI>New English Relations,</HI> have asked an Admission to the Communion. The Circumstances of <HI>Time,</HI> and <HI>Place,</HI> and <HI>Pub∣lickness</HI> for these Matters, in the several Chur∣ches are very Various; and left unto their own <HI>Discretion.</HI> And there is now generally a great <HI>Relaxation</HI> of several <HI>Severities,</HI> in the Modes of these Matters, formerly required in some of the Churches. For indeed, on this Occasion one may use the Words of the Roman Historian, <HI>No∣cuit antiquus Rigor, et Nimia Severitas, cui jam non pares sumus.</HI></P>
<P>§. 3. The Apprehension that appears to govern the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> is, That be a <HI>Church-State</HI> never so specious, it will be but a <HI>Dead Carcase</HI> in the Eyes of the Everliving GOD, yea, the Holy One will say, <HI>Bury it out of my Sight,</HI> if there be not real and vital <HI>Piety</HI> animat∣ing of it. The Church is not the <HI>King's Daugh∣ter,</HI> nor is there any true <HI>Glory</HI> belonging to her, if she be not <HI>all Glorious within,</HI> by an heavenly <HI>Piety</HI> Disposing and Adorning of her; The <HI>Piety,</HI> which lies in <HI>living</HI> to GOD, and <HI>by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</HI> and paying the constant Homage of our Souls unto Him, and <HI>Loving our Neigh∣bour,</HI> and expressing that <HI>Love</HI> to the Life, in a continual Endeavour to <HI>do as we would be done unto.</HI> As this is the truest and only <HI>Wisdom,</HI> so
<PB N="90" REF="002775_0105_0FE630C6A76791F8"/>'tis the truest and only <HI>Basis</HI> for an <HI>Union</HI> in the Churches of GOD. Accordingly 'tis the Design of these Churches, to make the <HI>Terms of Commu∣nion</HI> run as Parallel as may be with the <HI>Terms of Salvation;</HI> and exclude none from their sacred Fellowship, who <HI>have truely their Fellowship with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ;</HI> and re∣ceive all that our SAVIOUR will <HI>Receive unto the Glory of GOD.</HI> If any of the Churches insist on any little <HI>Modalities</HI> in their <HI>Admissions,</HI> they are all with an Eye the necessary Qualifications of the most <HI>Substantial PIETY;</HI> and it is to be hoped, they will be <HI>softened</HI> and <HI>ordered,</HI> and on Occasions <HI>Varied</HI> accordingly.</P>
<P>A Charitable Consideration of nothing but PIETY in admitting to Evangelical Priviledges, is a Glory that the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> would lay claim unto; Churches of which one of their Pastors once gave this Account unto his Correspondents in the <HI>Lower Saxony; Quod se nul∣lis Communionis Conditionibus, nisiquae sint et Uni∣onis cum Christo, Aeternaeque Salutis Conditiones, as∣tringant. Cunctos ad Dei Gloriam a Christo admissos, ad sacram cum ipsis Eucharistiam, et ad omnia Eccle∣siastica Privilegia fatentur admittendos. Calvinistae sunt qui Lutherranos; Presbyteriani qui Episcopales; Poedobaptistae qui Antipaedobaptistas, modo sincera in illis Pietas resplendeat, et si manifesto Deum timeant, Justi∣tiamque operentur, benignissime amplexantur.</HI></P>
<P>§. 4. Before the Persons who have thus pri∣vately addressed the <HI>Pastor</HI> for Admission into the Church, are publickly admitted, he propounds their <HI>Names</HI> unto the Congregation, with an
<PB N="91" REF="002775_0106_0FE630CC5839D7E0"/>Intimation of what they have desired. He takes his Time to <HI>Read</HI> or <HI>Tell</HI> unto the <HI>Church,</HI> (and sometimes as many of the <HI>mixed Assembly</HI> as please, are allowed also to stay,) what he judges proper of the <HI>Examination,</HI> which has been taken of their Pi∣ous <HI>Dispositions</HI> or <HI>Experiences;</HI> Adding, that he has received an Incouraging Testimony of their Con∣versation.</P>
<P>The Candidates of the Communion, at the proper time for it, standing forth, now the Pastor calls upon the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church, to signify their Consent unto the Admission of these Per∣sons unto their Communion, by <HI>lifting up their Hands;</HI> [For in all these Points, their <HI>Church-Go∣vernment</HI> is not unlike the Government reported by <HI>Plato</HI> to have been sometimes in <HI>Athens,</HI> which <HI>Grotius</HI> also tells us was the Government of the Primitive Churches; ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ ΜΕΤΑ ΕΥΔΟΚΙΑΣ ΤΟΥ ΠΛΗΘΟΥΣ. <HI>An Aristocracy order∣ing all things with the good liking of the People.</HI></P>
<P>This being signified, the <HI>Pastor</HI> then applies himself unto the <HI>Candidates,</HI> after some such Man∣ner of this.</P>
<P><HI>In the Fear of GOD, you are now to attend unto His most Gracious COVENANT; and may you by the Help of His Grace, give a most hearty Consent un∣to it.</HI></P>
<P><Q>You do now sincerely and very solemnly give up your selves unto the Glorious GOD, who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and receive Him as your GOD and Portion; Desiring to live unto Him. You do give up your selves unto the Lord JESUS
<PB N="92" REF="002775_0107_0FE630CC5C1721B0"/>CHRIST, who is GOD manifest in Flesh, as unto the Head of His Chosen People, and receive Him as made of GOD unto you, Wis∣dom, and Righteousness, and Holiness, and Re∣demption. You do likewise give your selves unto this Church of His; engaging with His Help, in the Communion thereof, to attend upon the Ordinances of the Gospel, while your Opportunities to be thereby Edified in your most Holy Faith shall here be continued unto you.</Q></P>
<P><HI>They</HI> by a proper Action shewing their Con∣sent hereunto; he adds;</P>
<P><Q>We then the Church of our SAVIOUR in this Place, do receive you into our sacred Fel∣lowship, and promise that by His Assistence, we will treat you with such Affection and Watch∣fulness, as your sacred Relation unto us now calleth for. This we do, imploring of our Lord, that both we and you, may obtain Mer∣cy to be faithful in His Covenant, and Glorify Him with the Holiness that becomes his House forever.</Q></P>
<P>A brief <HI>Prayer,</HI> wherein <HI>Thanks</HI> are given for the Gospel and the Success of it, and a <HI>Blessing</HI> is implored on the Church, and on those who now ask to be added thereto, and on others that may ask to be added, has been thought proper on these Occasions: Either at the Time of their <HI>Admission;</HI> or at the Time when their <HI>Qualifica∣tions</HI> for it, are exhibited.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> having thus propounded the <HI>Cove∣nant</HI> unto the Candidates, oftentimes makes a short Monitory Speech unto them; and perhaps
<PB N="93" REF="002775_0108_0FE630CD63BDC3D8"/>recommends to them a Passage of the <HI>Divine Oracles,</HI> which he would have them all their Days to think upon.</P>
<P>The Persons are after this reputed <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church, capable of <HI>Occasional Communion</HI> with any other also, wherever they may see Oc∣casion to desire it.</P>
<P>And they who from the State of <HI>Disciples,</HI> thus pass into the State of <HI>Brethren,</HI> are the only Per∣sons for whose <HI>formal Votes,</HI> the Pastors do call in managing any Part of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>I know not whether it will do the Part of an Effectual <HI>Apology,</HI> for the strictness of these Do∣ings in the Churches of <HI>New-England:</HI> But I will here observe, That it has been a Proposal made by some Conformable Divines, in the <HI>Church of England;</HI>
<Q>Would it not very much conduce unto the Glory of GOD, and the Edi∣fication of the People in their most Holy Faith, if every Person Baptised into the Christian Faith should be obliged, when he comes unto Years Discretion, to appear in the Public Congrega∣tion, there to make a Confession of his Faith, and recognize his Primitive Engagement; and that the Minister should recommend the Per∣son unto the Grace of GOD, that he may be established, and persevere, and continue for ever?</Q> Yea, there have lately been in the City of <HI>London,</HI> many <HI>Religious Societies,</HI> living in Con∣formity to the Rites of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> whereof the Relater says;
<Q>It is required of such as join to them, that they give the Socie∣ty a solemn Account of their Sense of Spiritual Things, with the real Motives, which lead them
<PB N="94" REF="002775_0109_0FE630CD688C6EA0"/>to this Undertaking, and what they seriously Purpose as to their future Life. This is many times done in Writing, — penned with such an honest, affectionate, and undisguised Style, with such pious and sensible Expressions, and in so modest and humble a Manner, that they would mightily affect any pious Person to read them, and move him to break forth into Pa∣thetic Praises to GOD, who has given such Grace to Young Men in so degenerate an Age.</Q> These <HI>Religious Societies</HI> have strict <HI>Orders</HI> among them, relating to a holy Life, and an <HI>Exemplary strictness</HI> of Conversation; To which every Mem∣ber, after Mature Deliberation subscribes his <HI>Name,</HI> with his Resolutions to live up unto them. The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> will not certainly be blamed <HI>After this!</HI></P>
<P>§. 5. We are not Insensible, That in the Fourth and Fifth Ages of the <HI>Primitive Christianity,</HI> it was counted an heinous Crime, to publish the <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Rites</HI> used in the <HI>Sacraments;</HI> Yea, they counted it a sort of <HI>Sacriledge,</HI> and worthy, <HI>Prolixiori Anathemate.</HI> Nor did they think, as <HI>Basil</HI> intimates, That they could be called <HI>Mys∣teries,</HI> if they were <HI>Exposed unto common and vulgar Notice.</HI> None of the
ΑΜΥΗΤΟΙ might be present at these <HI>Devotions;</HI> They secluded the <HI>Catechu∣mens</HI> from them; They declined all Recital of them in their <HI>Sermons</HI> to a Promiscuous Auditory, cutting off with such an <HI>Aposiopesis,</HI> as, <HI>nerunt Fi∣deles.</HI> To <HI>write</HI> them, was reckoned unlawful, They were <HI>Mysteria Chartis non Committenda;</HI> They were ΑΡΡΗΤΑ, and ΑΓΡΑΦΑ, Never∣theless,
<PB N="95" REF="002775_0110_0FE630D479A67410"/>I would now pass on, boldly and freely to describe the ΕΣΩΤΕΡΙΚΑ, the most <HI>Sacred,</HI> and most <HI>Secret,</HI> of the Transactions in the <HI>Chur∣ches</HI> of <HI>New-England;</HI> Believing that the Christi∣ans of old in their great <HI>Reservations,</HI> too much accommodated themselves unto the <HI>Pagans;</HI> a∣mong whom (as <HI>Justin</HI> tells us) <HI>Mysteria enunci∣asse,</HI> was a grievous <HI>Crime;</HI> and some tell us of those who <HI>died</HI> for it.</P>
<P>The Churches, like the <HI>Primitive,</HI> have no Times universally stated for their Celebration of the <HI>Eucharist.</HI> Some have it once in <HI>Four</HI> Weeks, some in <HI>Six,</HI> some in <HI>Eight,</HI> and some, the <HI>first Lord's Day</HI> in every <HI>Kalender</HI> Month; and some the <HI>last:</HI> Some in the close of the <HI>Afternoon:</HI> but most in the close of the <HI>Forenoon.</HI> And the <HI>Pastors</HI> likewise reserve to themselves a Liberty of <HI>Altering</HI> the Times as they judge fit upon Emergencies.</P>
<P>The Churches do generally see no Necessity of taking the <HI>Evening</HI> for the <HI>only Time</HI> of Cele∣brating the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> For though it be called by the Name of ΔΕΙΠΝΟΝ, 'tis well known, that in the Ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Authors, as Ancient as <HI>Homer</HI> him∣self, the Word is used for a <HI>Dinner,</HI> for a <HI>Break∣fast,</HI> for any <HI>Eating,</HI> as well as for a <HI>Supper.</HI> And <HI>Coena,</HI> which is the Term that Answers it in <HI>La∣tin,</HI> signifies any <HI>Eating in Common.</HI> Yea, the English Word <HI>Supper</HI> does not necessarily imply <HI>Night-Eating;</HI> The <HI>last Meal</HI> in the Day is a <HI>Supper,</HI> though it be several Hours before <HI>Night;</HI> and the Word being derived from SOPPE (which is <HI>Bread</HI> that is dipped in some <HI>Liquid thing</HI>) the <HI>Diet</HI> rather than the <HI>Season</HI> of Eating, is therein
<PB N="96" REF="002775_0111_0FE630D4CD6E9940"/>intimated. Wherefore the Churches do generally count themselves obliged no more to the <HI>Time</HI> of <HI>Night</HI> for the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> than to the <HI>Place</HI> of an <HI>Upper Chamber</HI> for it, or the Number <HI>Twelve</HI> of the <HI>Communicants.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, though <HI>Tertullian</HI> mentions the Celebra∣tion of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as being <HI>Tempore Victus,</HI> or at <HI>Supper-time;</HI> From which time of their As∣sembling, the Heathen probably took Occasion to accuse them of putting out their <HI>Lights,</HI> and then doing unknown Deeds of <HI>Darkness;</HI> yet the same <HI>Tertullian</HI> mentions the Celebration of the Sacrament also <HI>Antelucanis Caetibus,</HI> or in the <HI>Morning</HI> before break of Day; and the Pagan <HI>Pliny</HI> confirms the Report. <HI>Cyprian</HI> likewise mentions the Administration of it, both in the <HI>Evening</HI> and the <HI>Morning.</HI> It seems every Church then did, in this Matter, what best suited their own particular Circumstances.</P>
<P>When the LORD's SUPPER is to be admi∣nistred, the <HI>Pastor</HI> gives Notice of it a Week be∣fore hand. And when the <HI>Lord's Day</HI> for it ar∣rives, he usually accomodates the solemn Occasi∣on before him, with a Sermon upon some agree∣able <HI>Doctrine of the Gospel.</HI> In most Places there are held <HI>private Meetings</HI> of the Christians, on some Day of the Week, <HI>Preparatory</HI> to the Com∣munion; and it is a frequent thing for the Pastor to be present at some or other of them; or else perhaps to hold a <HI>Publick Lecture.</HI> But now on the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> the Ordinary Exercises being fi∣nished, the Rest of the Assembly are dismissed, except any devout Persons, who stay scattered
<PB N="97" REF="002775_0112_0FE630D68EA76B48"/>here and there, at some Distance from the Com∣municants, to be <HI>Spectators</HI> of the <HI>Mysteries.</HI> The <HI>Communicants</HI> now seating themselves together in the Body of the Meeting House, the <HI>Pastor</HI> de∣scends from the <HI>Pulpit</HI> unto the <HI>Table,</HI> which now stands furnished with the <HI>Sacramental Elements,</HI> before the <HI>Seat,</HI> usually designed for the <HI>Deacons,</HI> in the Sight of all the <HI>Communicants,</HI> and the <HI>Deacons</HI> do stand waiting before it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> having first mentioned the <HI>Names</HI> of the Persons (if there be any such) belonging to <HI>other Churches,</HI> who request a Part in the pre∣sent Communion, he then addresses himself with all possible Solemnity, unto the Celebration.</P>
<P>In some Churches, there is first, as there was in some of the Primitive, a <HI>Solita Praedicatio,</HI> or a <HI>Speech</HI> only unto the Communicants, to prepare them for the Action: But this is not in all.</P>
<P>With a short Passage equivalent unto the <HI>Sur∣sum Corda</HI> of the Ancients, [which, by the Way, confutes <HI>Transubstantiation</HI>] he bespeaks their At∣tention. But then, either he reads the whole Paragraph, Luk. XXII. 19, 20. Or, 1 Cor. XI. 23, 24, 25, 26. Or else, Makes the Recitation by Parcels. First, he says, <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST in the Night wherein he was betrayed, took BREAD.</HI> Upon so saying he touches with his <HI>Hand</HI> the <HI>Loaves</HI> of <HI>Bread</HI> in the <HI>Dishes,</HI> (or takes the <HI>Dishes</HI> towards him) now before him, unco∣vered, where they were aforehand fitted, easily to be <HI>broken</HI> in Pieces.</P>
<P>He adds; And HE BLESSED it;—where∣upon the <HI>Communicants</HI> now standing up, he now poureth out a <HI>Prayer</HI> before the Lord, filled with
<PB N="98" REF="002775_0113_0FE5F4B6ADD12040"/>the Acknowledgements of the <HI>Evangelical Truths,</HI> which this Institution invites us to think upon; and Supplications for the Divine <HI>Blessing,</HI> upon that Part of the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> now before them, and upon themselves in the Receiving of it. I may describe the <HI>Prayer</HI> in the Words of <HI>Justin Martyr;</HI>
<Q>The Minister gives Praise and Glory to the Lord of all, thro' the Son and the Holy Spirit; and in a large Manner renders particu∣lar Thanks for the present Mercies; who when he has ended his Prayers and Praises, the People say, <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Prayer</HI> being finished, the Communicants again sit down, and the <HI>Pastor</HI> says, <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST having Blessed the Bread, He BROKE it.</HI> Whereupon he proceeds to the <HI>Breaking of the Bread,</HI> in the View of the Com∣municants, who for the most Part are silently left unto their own <HI>Meditations,</HI> during this Acti∣on; though some of the Pastors Excite and As∣sist the <HI>Meditations</HI> of the People, by now and then uttering a <HI>Sentence</HI> of the sacred Scriptures, or of their own Pathetic Thoughts, unto them.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is all <HI>Broken</HI> into convenient Parcels, he says to this Effect: <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, having broken the Bread, He GAVE IT unto His Disciples, saying, This is my Body which is broken for you, take it, and eat of it, and do it in Remembrance of me. Wherefore in the Name of that Glorious Lord, I now invite you, to TAKE, and EAT hereof; and to do it in Remembrance of Him.</HI> So, He himself <HI>Takes</HI> and <HI>Eats</HI> of this <HI>Bread:</HI> But as he <HI>takes</HI> it himself, he <HI>gives</HI> the Dishes unto the
<PB N="99" REF="002775_0114_0FE630D692802520"/><HI>Deacons,</HI> by whose Help they are handed about among the <HI>Communicants,</HI> until they do all, <HI>sitting</HI> in a Devout Manner [In the Primitive Times, <HI>Reader,</HI> we are very certain, they did not use to do it, <HI>Kneeling!</HI>] <HI>Take</HI> and <HI>Eat</HI> thereof. In <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Time and Place the <HI>Communicants</HI> did not receive the Elements, <HI>De aliorum Manu quam Praesidentium:</HI> But in the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> they do as in <HI>Justin Martyr</HI>'s; ΔΙΑΚΟΝΟΙ ΔΙΔΟ∣ΑΣΙΝ.
<Q>The Deacons give the Consecrated Bread and Wine to those that are present.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Deacons</HI> returning with the Remainders, the <HI>Pastor</HI> stands up, and Enquires, <HI>Whether any to whom that Bread of the Lord, and of Life, should have been given, have not received it?</HI> If a <HI>Sign</HI> of any such be given, 'tis carried unto them. And when all are served, the <HI>Deacons</HI> do then sit down and partake of their Portion also.</P>
<P>And here one Remark more may be inserted. In the Primitive Churches, the <HI>Deacons</HI> did most∣ly with their own Hands give the <HI>Bread</HI> unto each of the <HI>Communicants.</HI> Only in the Church of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> I find it insinuated by <HI>Clemens A∣lexandrinus,</HI> that each of the <HI>Communicants</HI> there took the <HI>Bread</HI> himself out of the Plate when it was consecrated. And the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> are in <HI>This,</HI> like that of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> then <HI>rising, takes</HI> a <HI>Cup</HI> of the <HI>Wine</HI> that is now in the <HI>Flagons</HI> and the <HI>Tankards</HI> on the Holy Table; and says, <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST after the same Manner TOOK THE CUP;</HI> adding — <HI>And He GAVE THANKS.</HI></P>

The Communicants thereupon again standing up; he pours out a Prayer, of the like Impor∣tance, the like Tendency, with the former. In∣deed, in the Primitive Churches, there was usu∣ally but <HI>one long Prayer</HI> before the Distribution of the <HI>Elements;</HI> which also were both of 'em <HI>at once</HI> consecrated. But in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> so far as I am informed, the Pastor makes <HI>Two Prayers,</HI> a first before the Distribution of the <HI>Bread,</HI> and then a second before the Distri∣bution of the <HI>Wine</HI> in the <HI>Eucharist.</HI></P>
<P>Then filling out the <HI>Wine</HI> from the <HI>Flagons</HI> in∣to the <HI>Cups,</HI> [Though the <HI>Pouring out of the Wine</HI> is not properly one of the <HI>Sacramental Actions,</HI> and if there stand any <HI>Tankards</HI> on the <HI>Table</HI> ready filled, it is accordingly omitted <HI>there;</HI>] he pro∣ceeds to speak unto this Effect, <HI>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST hereupon GAVE the CUP to His Disciples, saying, This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood, which is shed for you and for many for the Remission of Sins; TAKE it, and all you DRINK of it, and do it in Remembrance of me. Wherefore in the Name of that most Gracious Lord, I invite you to TAKE and DRINK hereof, and to do it in Remembrance of Him.</HI> So he himself <HI>Takes</HI> and <HI>Drinks</HI> of the <HI>Wine,</HI> and the <HI>Deacons</HI> do Dispense and Disperse the <HI>Cups</HI> among the <HI>Communicants;</HI> who still using the Table Posture of <HI>sitting,</HI> do in a devout Manner <HI>Take</HI> and <HI>Drink</HI> thereof. The <HI>Deacons</HI> return with their emptied Cups unto the <HI>Pastor,</HI> who a∣gain fills them, till there be no more Occasion. And when all seem to be served he inquires, <HI>Whether any to whom that Cup of the Lord, and of Blessing, hen belonged, had been omitted in the Dispensa∣tion?</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="002775_0116_0FE630DC00F22060"/>— The <HI>Deacons</HI> then sit down and par∣take as before.</P>
<P>A <HI>Psalm</HI> chose (and in some Places read) by the <HI>Pastor,</HI> is hereupon <HI>Sung</HI> by the <HI>Communicants.</HI> This in the Primitive Churches was usually done <HI>before the last Prayer.</HI> Some of ours do it <HI>after.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> now (as <HI>Tertullian</HI> says, <HI>Oratio Con∣vivium dirimit</HI>) passes on to a <HI>third Prayer;</HI> con∣sisting of the most Raised <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> to GOD, and <HI>Assurance</HI> of the Blessings in the <HI>New Cove∣nant,</HI> sealed by this Ordinance. And as <HI>Chrysos∣tom</HI> tells us, one had need have the ΠΑΡΡΗΣΙΑ, the <HI>Confidence,</HI> the <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Enlargements</HI> of a <HI>Moses</HI> or <HI>Elias,</HI> to <HI>Pray</HI> as they did use to do in the Primitive Times at the <HI>Eucharist;</HI> It may now be said, That some of the <HI>Pastors</HI> often pray with very much of the Spirit of a <HI>Moses,</HI> or an <HI>Elias,</HI> on these <HI>Eucharistical</HI> Occasions. Or, the same Account may be given of them, that <HI>Na∣zianzen</HI> gives of the Prayers made by his Vene∣rable Father in the Celebrating of the <HI>Eucharist; They have been made,</HI> ΠΑΡΑ ΤΟΥ ΑΓΙΟΥ ΠΝΕΥΜΑΤΟΣ, <HI>by the Holy Spirit of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Many of the Churches, every time the <HI>Eucha∣rist</HI> is administred, but some once a Quarter, some once a Year, have what <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> calls in the Primitive Churches, ΤΑ ΣΥΛΛΕΛΟΜΕΝΑ, and what <HI>Tertullian</HI> calls <HI>Deposita Pietatis;</HI> their <HI>Contributions,</HI> wherein they gather Money to re∣lieve the <HI>Poor,</HI> as well as to defray the Charges of <HI>Eucharist.</HI> What was gathered in the Primi∣tive Churches was committed unto the <HI>Pastors,</HI> to relieve <HI>Widows,</HI> and <HI>Orphans,</HI> and <HI>Prisoners,</HI> and <HI>Strangers,</HI> and in a Word, <HI>All that were in Want.</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="002775_0117_0FE630DE81B875D0"/>In the <HI>New-English</HI> it is committed unto the <HI>Deacons.</HI></P>
<P>This done, the <HI>Pastor</HI> pronouncing a <HI>Blessing</HI> dis∣misses the Assembly.</P>
<P>§. 6. It being a main Scope of the <HI>Lord's Sup∣per</HI> to be a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Seal</HI> of that Mystery, <HI>The Communion of Saints;</HI> wherein, as many <HI>Grains</HI> make but one <HI>Loaf</HI> of <HI>Bread,</HI> and many <HI>Drops</HI> make but one <HI>Cup</HI> of <HI>Wine,</HI> so, many <HI>Saints</HI> make but <HI>one Church;</HI> The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> judge it not so proper for one or two, by a <HI>Bed side,</HI> or the like, to celebrate this Ordinance: But chuse rather to say, with <HI>Cyprian, Sacramenti Veritatem Fraternitate omni presente celebramus;</HI> The <HI>whole Fraternity</HI> come together for it. And in laying aside the <HI>private Celebration</HI> of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> they have not only the Writings of such Reform∣ers, as <HI>Musculus,</HI> and <HI>Bullinger,</HI> and <HI>Beza,</HI> and <HI>Danaeus,</HI> and <HI>Aretius,</HI> and other Great Names, but also the Custom of the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>Scotch,</HI> and the purest Churches of the Reformati∣on, to encourage them. Nor yet would they have reckoned <HI>this</HI> enough, if the <HI>Scriptures</HI> had not Intimated, that there must be a <HI>Synaxis,</HI> an <HI>Assembly,</HI> of a Church <HI>coming together</HI> for the Pur∣pose; and enow to be called, <HI>Many.</HI> Wherefore the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> agree to the Advice of the Excellent <HI>Alting;</HI>
<Q>Let the Well often Appoach unto the Supper of the Lord, and let the Sick recall to mind what they formerly en∣joyed in such Approaches: Contenting them∣selves with a Spiritual Communion; according to that of <HI>Austin,</HI> CREDE ET MANDUCASTI.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE VI. The <HI>Pastoral Care</HI> Exercised in the more PRIVATE SERVICES of it.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. A Pastor being one that is to <HI>watch for the Souls</HI> of his Flock, <HI>as one that is to give an Account,</HI> there are <HI>Private</HI> as well as <HI>Pub∣lick</HI> Services expected from him; whereof the <HI>first</HI> and not the <HI>least,</HI> is that of CATECHIS∣ING.</P>
<P>The Work of a <HI>Catechist</HI> was often a <HI>Distinct Office,</HI> in the <HI>Primitive Churches:</HI> But it is rec∣koned incumbent for the most Part upon every <HI>Pastor</HI> in the <HI>New English:</HI> And there is much <HI>Variety</HI> used in the Discharge of it.</P>
<P>Formerly, There were several Divines in these Churches (it were easy to reckon more than a <HI>Decemvirate</HI> of them) who, like <HI>Cyril,</HI> and some others of the Fathers, composed and published <HI>Catechisms</HI> of their own, which were designed more peculiarly for the Edification of the parti∣cular People, with whom they were <HI>travail∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>There is not above one or two of those, used at this Day. That which is most so, is the <HI>Milk
<PB N="104" REF="002775_0119_0FE630E566B98B30"/>for Babes,</HI> which many of our Children have their Instruction begun withal. But the <HI>Catechism</HI> which now generally obtains is that of the <HI>Assem∣bly of Divines,</HI> (prepared originally by a <HI>Trium∣virate</HI> never to be forgotten, Dr. <HI>Arrowsmith,</HI> Dr. <HI>Tuckney,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newcomen,</HI>) whereof the gene∣ral Opinion, is, <HI>That no Man's Reproach can lessen, and no Man's Applause can heighten, the Reputation that belongs unto it.</HI> Albeit there are those also, who even in this find some <HI>Deficiencies,</HI> and some <HI>Redundancies.</HI></P>
<P>By some of the <HI>Pastors,</HI> the Work of <HI>Catechising,</HI> and the Task of a <HI>Pantaenus,</HI> or an <HI>Origen,</HI> has been done, with a special Aim and Hope to at∣tend the Great and Good <HI>Preservative of the Chur∣ches,</HI> which has of old been known by the Name of, CONFIRMATION; That is to say, when the <HI>Children Baptised</HI> in the Churches come to be of Age, the Pastors do send for them, and <HI>Examine</HI> them discreetly and faithfully, concerning their <HI>Improvement</HI> in <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD, and <HI>Resolutions</HI> for a Life of PIETY, and <HI>Inclina∣tions</HI> to the Remembring and Renewing of their <HI>Baptismal Covenant.</HI> Those in whom there are found the Agreeable Symptoms of a <HI>Regenerate Mind,</HI> are advised immediately to apply them∣selves for a CONFIRMATION of their <HI>Church-Membership,</HI> in a <HI>full Communion</HI> with the Church∣es. Those who are found of a more discourag∣ing and undesireable Character, have suitable <HI>Admonitions</HI> bestowed upon them; Until they have hearkened whereunto, they may not ex∣pect the <HI>Priviledges</HI> of <HI>Adult Members</HI> in the
<PB N="105" REF="002775_0120_0FE630E56AA4D308"/>Churches of the Lord. But other <HI>Pastors</HI> have yet their own <HI>Methods.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Pastors</HI> do on the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> in the <HI>Afternoons,</HI> before the Sermon, make the Young People publickly to Answer the <HI>Cate∣chism.</HI></P>
<P>Others of the <HI>Pastors</HI> do on some <HI>Week-Days,</HI> publickly hear their Young People answer to the <HI>Catechism.</HI> And then they make a short <HI>Ser∣mon,</HI> upon one of the <HI>Questions.</HI> Or, perhaps upon some Text, for the Animation of <HI>Early Piety.</HI></P>
<P>There are yet others who send for the Young People to their Houses, <HI>numbring</HI> and <HI>sorting</HI> of them as they think fit; and then, when they have Answered the <HI>Catechism,</HI> there are Pasto∣ral and Personal <HI>Admonitions</HI> given unto them, <HI>to Remember their CREATOR in the Days of their Youth.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Pastors</HI> chuse to do this Part of their Office after the <HI>Pauline</HI> way, <HI>To teach from House to House.</HI> And perhaps <HI>no way more signifi∣cant!</HI> The Pastor may send aforehand unto such <HI>Families</HI> as he intends, an Intimation <HI>that</HI> he intends at such a Time to Visit them: And coming to the <HI>Families,</HI> he assays with as decent and as pungent Addresses as he is able, to treat each Person particularly about their Everlasting Interests. And unto the <HI>Young People,</HI> he puts Questions of the <HI>Catechism,</HI> from the Answers whereof he makes as lively Applications unto them as he can, for the Engaging of them in the Service of the Lord. No doubt, he seldom
<PB N="106" REF="002775_0121_0FE630E66F08B1F8"/>leaves a <HI>Family,</HI> without many Tears falling from Souls, <HI>desirous to Fear the Name of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Pastors</HI> do sometimes Imitate the Ex∣ample of <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> of whom we find,
<Q>That he would Inculcate Things on his People, with private Communications. And of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who would Go to every one that was committed to his Care, and Exhort them, according to the Ministry of the Lord, and of His Gospel:</Q> And of <HI>Austin,</HI> whose <HI>Private Labours</HI> to instruct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Flock are celebrated by <HI>Posidonius.</HI> They are sensible of what is Urged by <HI>Prosper,</HI>
<Q>That <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> are called <HI>Watchmen,</HI> because they should Watch the Actions of all Men, and with an Aim of Religious Curiosity spy out, how every one liveth, with his Household in his House: What good Men they approve, they are to Confirm, by Honouring them; whom they observe to be Vicious, they are to Amend, by Reproving them.</Q></P>
<P>§. 2. The VISITATION OF THE SICK, (and so, of the <HI>Afflicted</HI>) is a Work for which there are <HI>particular Officers,</HI> Men of Piety, and Gravity, and Experience, appointed in some Churches of the <HI>Reformation.</HI> And others as well as the Great <HI>Voetius,</HI> make a fair Apology for it.</P>
<P>But in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> that Work is incumbent on the <HI>Pastors,</HI> and account∣ed no little Part of the <HI>Pastoral Care.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>other Afflictions</HI> (as the Loss of <HI>Desireable Relatives,</HI> or singular <HI>Temptations,</HI> and <HI>Exercises</HI>) the <HI>Pastors</HI> do <HI>Visit</HI> their People, and suit their
<PB N="107" REF="002775_0122_0FE630E673038E18"/>Discourses unto the Occasions; and perhaps put suitable <HI>Books of Piety</HI> into their Hands. And then they usually <HI>Pray</HI> with them, that they may carry it well under their <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and that the Holy Ends thereof, may be obtained upon them. Thus particularly they <HI>make the Heart of the Widow to sing</HI> with the <HI>Joys</HI> of Piety.</P>
<P>But the SICK are a special and frequent Ob∣ject of the <HI>Pastoral Care.</HI> The Pastors, when the <HI>Sick Person</HI> sends for them (and often with∣out their sending, and though they forget their Duty, to <HI>call for the Elders</HI>) have a very <HI>serious,</HI> and sometimes a very <HI>difficult</HI> Work to do. If the <HI>Sick</HI> be capable of <HI>Receiving Instruction,</HI> the <HI>Pastors</HI> now set before him, in lively Terms, the <HI>Miserable State</HI> which by <HI>Sin,</HI> both <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Actual</HI> he is fallen into: and seeing him affected with a Sense of his <HI>Misery,</HI> they then as livelily propose to him the <HI>Remedy</HI> in a Great SAVIOUR provided for him. In the <HI>Directories</HI> prepared many Ages ago, for the <HI>Visitation of the Sick,</HI> it was directed that the <HI>Sick</HI> Person should say, <HI>O my GOD, I now place the Death of my Lord JESUS CHRIST between Thee and my Sins:</HI> Thus our Pas∣tors do assist the <HI>Sick</HI> Person, all they can, to place his <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> and the <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, for Deliverance from <HI>Eternal Death,</HI> as well as <HI>Temporal.</HI> They Tender the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> to him in the seve∣ral Articles of it, and obtain his <HI>Explicit Consent</HI> unto them all. They repeat the <HI>Calls of the Gos∣pel</HI> to him, and they obtain such Answers there∣unto, as to make it hopeful that they are become <HI>Effectual.</HI> They set before him the <HI>very great
<PB N="108" REF="002775_0123_0FE630ED5DACB5D0"/>and precious Promises of GOD</HI> unto returning Sin∣ners, and especially such Words of a Merciful SAVIOUR as that [worth a Thousand Worlds!] <HI>Himthat cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> They go through a <HI>Process of Repentance</HI> with him; Urging him to look upon the <HI>Sins</HI> of his <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> with a due <HI>Contrition</HI> for them; to make the Flight of a Distressed Soul unto the <HI>Open Fountain</HI> for the <HI>Forgiveness</HI> of them; and there∣withal to resign up his Mind unto the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> that he may be made a <HI>new Creature,</HI> and be brought into the <HI>Life of GOD.</HI> And that <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> may have its <HI>perfect Work</HI> (if they appre∣hend Occasion for it) they <HI>exhort</HI> him, That if he have <HI>wronged</HI> any Neighbour either in his <HI>Es∣tate</HI> or his <HI>Esteem,</HI> he would now make him all possible <HI>Reparation;</HI> Or, That if he has had any <HI>Companions in Impicty,</HI> he would now give his faithful <HI>Warnings</HI> and <HI>Rebukes</HI> unto them. If the Patient has been of <HI>Conspicuous Piety,</HI> they com∣fort him with the best Views they can give him of the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> of which he is now upon the Borders, and of the <HI>Rest which remains for the People of GOD.</HI> Finally, A Profound <HI>Resigna∣tion to the Will of GOD,</HI> is recommended as what He is <HI>well pleased withal.</HI></P>
<P>When these things are done, as far as there is Opportunity for them, the <HI>Pastors</HI> proceed unto their <HI>Prayers,</HI> wherein such Purposes as these are Considered and Prosecuted.</P>
<P>The Glorious GOD, who is the <HI>Father of Mercies,</HI> and our most Merciful Father in our Lord JESUS CHRIST, is acknowledged as
<PB N="109" REF="002775_0124_0FE630ED63DCE880"/>commanding us to <HI>Love one another,</HI> and with a Spirit of Love to <HI>Pray for one another.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD our <HI>Maker,</HI> is ac∣knowledged as ordering the Condition of the Sick Person, and as <HI>performing the Thing that is ap∣pointed for us,</HI> in all Occurrences.</P>
<P>GOD is adored as <HI>Wounding,</HI> and as <HI>Healing,</HI> as <HI>Killing,</HI> and as <HI>Quickening,</HI> and as the <HI>Sovereign</HI> GOD before whom we are as the <HI>Clay before the Potter.</HI></P>
<P>— Adored as a <HI>Righteous</HI> GOD, unto whose <HI>Justice</HI> we have by our Sins sorfeited our <HI>Lives,</HI> and all the Comforts of them.</P>
<P>— Adored as a <HI>Gracious</HI> GOD, and one <HI>ready to pardon;</HI> and having in the Mediation of the Great SAVIOUR provided an admirable Way sor His <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> to reach unto us.</P>
<P>The Application of this <HI>Mercy,</HI> with the <HI>Blood</HI> in which it flows down, unto the Soul of the Sick Person, is then implored. And it is there∣fore asked, that he may with a <HI>Repenting Soul,</HI> bewail all the <HI>Errors</HI> of his <HI>Life;</HI> all his Forget∣fulness of GOD, and of the <HI>Errand</HI> which GOD sent him into the World upon; all his Violati∣ons of the Divine <HI>Laws,</HI> and of his own <HI>Vows;</HI> all his <HI>Neglect</HI> of the <HI>Great Salvation;</HI> all his <HI>Misimprovements</HI> under Means of Good; all his <HI>Misbehaviours</HI> in all <HI>Conditions,</HI> and all <HI>Relations,</HI> and all <HI>Employments;</HI> and above all that he may lay to <HI>Heart</HI> the <HI>Fountain of Sin</HI> in his <HI>Heart,</HI> which he brought into the World with him.</P>
<P>It is hereupon asked, That with a lively <HI>Faith,</HI> he may be helped from above to make the
<PB N="110" REF="002775_0125_0FE630EF1DB22C40"/><HI>Flight</HI> of a Distressed Soul, unto the <HI>Blood</HI> which <HI>Cleanses from all Sin,</HI> and plead the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of our Great SAVIOUR for His Atonement, and make the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Great SAVIOUR his only Plea for his Acceptance with GOD. But that he may be <HI>made willing</HI> at the same Time to submit unto the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> and all His <HI>Gra∣tious Operations;</HI> and that he may accordingly have the Experience thereof, quickening him to <HI>Turn</HI> and <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD; and that the <HI>Sancti∣fying Work</HI> of the Holy Spirit upon his Mind, may prove a Real, Thorough, Saving Work, and an <HI>Hope that will not make ashamed;</HI> and that the present Circumstances of the Sick Person may contribute unto it.</P>
<P>It is then prayed, That his <HI>Health</HI> may be re∣stored, and his <HI>Life</HI> prolonged; and that he may come out of his present Illness as <HI>Gold out of the Fire.</HI> But that if he must now be called out of this World, he may go away with all pos∣sible <HI>Resignation</HI> to the Will of GOD, and <HI>finish well,</HI> and go chearfully through the <HI>Valley of the Shadow of Death,</HI> and be <HI>presented Faultless before the presence of His Glory with Exceeding Joy.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon suitable Mercies are also asked for the <HI>Relatives.</HI></P>
<P>And it is asked for the <HI>By standers,</HI> that all may be duely affected with a Sense of our <HI>Frailty,</HI> and speedily get into good Terms with Heaven, and leave <HI>nothing undone,</HI> that Men will wish to have done, when the Dying Hour comes upon them.</P>
<P>If they be <HI>Sick Children</HI> that are prayed with∣al, Pains are taken, in the first Place, to dispose
<PB N="111" REF="002775_0126_0FE630EF21C30548"/>the Minds of the <HI>Parents</HI> unto the Holy <HI>Resigna∣tion</HI> with which they are to offer the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> now called for. And then the Prayer takes Notice of certain peculiar and adapted Arti∣cles.</P>
<P>It owns the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD, without which not a <HI>Bird of the Air falls to the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>It bewails the sad Effects of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> ap∣pearing in the Miseries that attend us, even from our most <HI>Early Infancy.</HI></P>
<P>It prays for the <HI>Recovery</HI> of the Child: But that if the Child be to Die, it may yet have a Soul sprinkled with the <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Lumb of GOD,</HI> and <HI>bound up in the Bundle of Life.</HI></P>
<P>It puts the Child into the Hands of the Great SAVIOUR, that <HI>good Shepherd,</HI> who hath said, <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me.</HI></P>
<P>It intreats for the <HI>Parents,</HI> the Graces proper for the Occasion, especially the <HI>Repentance</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> thus <HI>brought unto Remembrance;</HI> and a sensible Im∣provement in all <HI>Piety;</HI> with a Part in a Glori∣ous CHRIST, which will abundantly make up all their Losses.</P>
<P>§. 3. Though the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> have with other Churches of the Reformation, sufficiently renounced the <HI>Popish</HI> Notion of the <HI>seven Sacraments;</HI> nor have they any <HI>Spiritual Courts</HI> for the Trial of <HI>Matrimonial Causes;</HI> yet the Cele∣bration of a MARRIAGE in them, is now ge∣nerally performed by their <HI>Pastors.</HI> For many Years after the first Settlement of these Colonies, a <HI>Marriage</HI> was ever celebrated by the <HI>Civil Ma∣gistrate;</HI> who not only gave the <HI>Marriage Cove∣nant</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="002775_0127_0FE630F56C31CFF0"/>unto the Parties, but also made the <HI>Prayers</HI> proper for the Occasion: However, if a <HI>Minis∣ter</HI> were present, he was desired usually, to make at least one of the <HI>Prayers.</HI> And the <HI>Justices</HI> have by Law to this Day, the Power to do it. But now the general <HI>Practise</HI> and <HI>Custom</HI> is for the <HI>Pastors</HI> to do it, tho' their <HI>Power</HI> be limited by the Law unto the Towns in which they en∣joy the constant Exercise of their Ministry. Be∣cause the <HI>Prayers</HI> of <HI>Benediction</HI> on the <HI>Marriage</HI> are most proper to be made by the <HI>Pastors,</HI> the People generally request and expect their <HI>Pastors</HI> also to give the <HI>Covenant</HI> of their <HI>Marriage</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>In former Times our <HI>People,</HI> in Conformity to the Usages in the Ancient Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> and what have been continued in some Churches of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> maintained a Solemnity, called a <HI>Contraction,</HI> a little before the Consummation of a <HI>Marriage</HI> was allowed of. A <HI>Pastor</HI> was usually imployed, and a <HI>Sermon</HI> also preached on this Oc∣casion. But these Ancient <HI>Sponsalia,</HI> are now wholly laid aside.</P>
<P>The <HI>Weddings</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> are for the most part celebrated with less of <HI>public Appearance</HI> than they are in some other Countrys; by which 'tis thought that many <HI>Inconveniencies</HI> are <HI>avoided.</HI></P>
<P>It has been a Case handled by Divines, <HI>An Nuptiarum Celebratio conveniat Diebus Dominicis?</HI> The Celebration of <HI>Weddings</HI> on the <HI>Lord's Days</HI> was represented unto the Renowned Synod of <HI>Dert,</HI> among the <HI>Grievances,</HI> which the lesser Sy∣nods of <HI>Holland</HI> complained of. And such Di∣vines
<PB N="113" REF="002775_0128_0FE630F570168048"/>as the famous <HI>Walaeus,</HI> and <HI>Zepperus,</HI> and <HI>Voetius,</HI> and an Army more, have made just and strong Remonstrances against them. The Churches of <HI>New England</HI> wholly decline them. [However the Appearing of the <HI>Bridegroom</HI> and <HI>Bride,</HI> in the Condition of Persons <HI>uewly Married,</HI> in the publick Assembly on the next <HI>Lord's Day</HI> after their <HI>Marriage,</HI> is a Thing usually looked for.] And a <HI>Wedding</HI> on a Day directed by the Govern∣ment for a <HI>FAST</HI> would be (from the Second Chapter of <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> and the Sixteenth Verse) as much disallowed of.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Wedding</HI> Arrives, the <HI>Bridegroom</HI> with the <HI>Bride,</HI> having some Attendents, present themselves before the <HI>Pastor,</HI> and give him the <HI>Certificate</HI> of their <HI>Lawful Publication,</HI> with which the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own-Clerk</HI> must furnish them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> begins with a <HI>Prayer</HI> which turns upon such Articles as these.</P>
<P>The Glorious GOD is acknowledged as the Giver of every <HI>Good Gift;</HI> The Extent of His <HI>Providence,</HI> and a <HI>Providence</HI> too under the Ma∣nagement of our <HI>Mediator</HI> JESUS, is consider∣ed; —</P>
<P>In all the Good that is done for us the Sovereign <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of our GOD is confessed; And our SAVIOUR by His Blood purchasing for us the <HI>Blessings of Goodness,</HI> whereof our Sins have made a Forfeiture.</P>
<P>It is desired, That our Blessings may prove <HI>Blessings indeed</HI> unto us, and assist us in the Service of GOD.</P>
<P>The Goodness of GOD in appointing the <HI>Mar∣ried State</HI> is adored; — and His <HI>Providence</HI> in
<PB N="114" REF="002775_0129_0FE630F7453E58A0"/>chusing the <HI>Relatives</HI> which He therein gives to each other, is admired.</P>
<P>A <HI>Dependence</HI> on the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR, for our <HI>Welfare</HI> in the <HI>Married</HI> (as well as in every other) <HI>State</HI> is expressed.</P>
<P>For the ensuring of such a <HI>Welfare</HI> there is an Eye had unto the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> wherein <HI>our Maker is our Husband,</HI> and our SAVIOUR is wil∣ling to <HI>Espouse</HI> us unto Himself in <HI>Faithfulness for ever.</HI> The marvellous Condescention of the Glo∣rious LORD in the Proposal of such an <HI>Espousal,</HI> is wondred at; The <HI>Enmity</HI> of our <HI>Carnal Minds</HI> against this Blessedness is deprecated; And pro∣per Expressions of a <HI>Consent</HI> unto the Gracious <HI>Proposal,</HI> are then endeavoured.</P>
<P>That Promise of the Covenant, for <HI>all Things to Work together for Good</HI> is now laid hold upon; and it is asked, That as our <HI>Sorrows</HI> may make us Wiser and Better, so our <HI>Comforts</HI> may quicken us to Glorify our GOD, in a Life of Obedience unto Him.</P>
<P>It is more particularly asked, on the behalf of the Persons who are now entring into the <HI>Cove∣nant</HI> of the <HI>Married State,</HI> That they may now first <HI>give themselves unto the Lord,</HI> and have the <HI>Pardon</HI> of all their Sins through the Blood of the <HI>Great Sacrifice,</HI> and that so the Blessing of GOD may be upon them in their now <HI>giving themselves to each other,</HI> according to His Institution.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prayer</HI> being finished, he now says to the Couple before him;</P>
<P><Q>You are now to attend unto a Covenant of GOD; the Covenant of your Marriage before Him. —</Q></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="002775_0130_0FE630F7490FCF18"/>
<Q>Give therefore your Hands, with your Hearts, unto one another. —</Q></P>
<P>This being done, he addresses the <HI>Man,</HI> to this Effect: —
<Q>The Person whom you now take by the Hand, you take to be your Wedded Wise; Depending on the Grace of Heaven, you promise to Love her, to Honour her, to Support her; and to treat her in that Relation, as it becomes a Professor of the Glorious Gospel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, so long as you live both together in this World. This Pro∣mise you make as in the Presence of GOD, and before these Witnesses —</Q></P>
<P>And then, the <HI>Woman:</HI> —
<Q>The Person whom you now take by the Hand, you take to be your Wedded Husband: With Dependence on the Grace of Heaven, you promise to Love him, to Honour him, to Obey him, and to Treat him with a Behaviour, that may Answer and Adorn the Doctrine of GOD your SAVI∣OUR, so long as you both live together in this World. This Promise you make as in the Presence of the Great GOD, and before these Witnesses.</Q></P>
<P>A <HI>Consent</HI> unto this <HI>Covenant,</HI> being some way signified, he adds, —</P>
<P><Q>I then declare you to be Married, according to the Laws of GOD, and of this Province. And what GOD has joined, Man may not se∣parate.</Q></P>
<P>In former Ages there was, and still in other Places, there is, much Stress laid upon the <HI>Wed∣ding Ring.</HI> In the <HI>Roman Ritual,</HI> there is a Form of <HI>Benediction</HI> used by the Priest upon it. The
<PB N="116" REF="002775_0131_0FE630FEADF8EFA8"/>Religious Consecration of this <HI>Annulus pronubus,</HI> is described by <HI>Pignorius.</HI> But passing by what <HI>Gorlaeus</HI> in his <HI>Dactylotheca,</HI> and others have Re∣marked upon the Matter, we shall only say, that in the <HI>Weddings</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> the <HI>Ring</HI> makes none of the <HI>Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> now proceeds unto another <HI>Prayer;</HI> wherein, — The <HI>Honour</HI> which GOD has put up∣on <HI>Marriage</HI> by His Instituting of it in <HI>Paradise,</HI> and the Presence and Favour of our Great SA∣VIOUR once Working a <HI>Miracle</HI> at it, is con∣sidered. — The Grace to carry it well in all <HI>Re∣lations</HI> is asked for; and particularly for the Per∣sons now <HI>Married, — That</HI> their <HI>Behaviour</HI> to∣wards each other may be full of that <HI>Goodness,</HI> which may be a lively and lovely Emblem, of of what passes between the Lord JESUS CHRIST and His Church; — <HI>That</HI> they may be such <HI>Bles∣sings</HI> to each other, as that they may have Cause every Day to give Thanks unto GOD for giving them to one another; <HI>That</HI> all the Blessings of the <HI>Married State</HI> which are to be desired and ex∣pected, may be bestowed upon them; — Above all. <HI>That</HI> they may be blessed with <HI>Spiritual Blessings;</HI> &amp; their <HI>Family</HI> may prove a <HI>Religious Fami∣ly;</HI> and an House wherein the Religion of GOD our SAVIOUR shall be carried on with <HI>Continu∣al Sacrifices; That</HI> our Lord would help them to <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss the Time of their Sojourning here</HI> in the <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD, and prepare them for their <HI>parting Time,</HI> and for all the <HI>Troubles</HI> of this present Evil World, and at length give them a Portion in that better World, where they <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y not, nor are given in Marriage,</HI> but are <HI>wholy for the Lord; — That</HI> the

<HEAD>PROPOSALS; for the Preservation of Re∣ligion in the Churches, by a due TRIAL of them that stand CANDIDATES OF THE MINISTRY.</HEAD>
<P>It is a thing of Great Consequence to the Safety and Welfare of our Churches, and the Interests of our Holy Religion are not a little concerned in it, That the <HI>Candidates of the E∣vangelical Ministry</HI> from time to time arising a∣mong us, should still be offered unto the Accep∣tance of the Churches, under the Advantage of their having undergone a due TRIAL of their <HI>Qualifications,</HI> for so solemn, and sacred a Service. And it hath long been the Wish of prudent Men, who wish well to the Interests Religion, That none of our Christian <HI>Congrega∣tions</HI> may countenance any, who shall set up for publick Preachers of the Gospel, until they can produce a <HI>Testimonial</HI> of their having been duely proved and approved, as <HI>Qualified</HI> for so Weighty an Undertaking.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">I. It is proposed, that every <HI>Candidate of the Ministry,</HI> be furnished with a TESTIMONIAL, under the Hands of at least <HI>Four</HI> or <HI>Five settled Pastors</HI> in our Churches, of his having been <HI>Tried</HI> upon the EXPECTED ARTICLES, and of his being upon <HI>Trial</HI> found competently <HI>Qualified,</HI> for the Encouragements of a <HI>publick
<PB N="119" REF="002775_0134_0FE630FFBB312ED8"/>Preacher</HI> among the Congregations of GOD in the Land. And that none presume to enter up∣on a <HI>Course</HI> of treating any of our Congregati∣ons, with their <HI>Sermons,</HI> until they have ap∣plied themselves unto such a Number of our <HI>Pastors,</HI> for such a <HI>Testimonial.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. It is proposed, That the EXPECTED ARTICLES on which the <HI>Candidates of the Ministry</HI> shall be <HI>Tried,</HI> shall be these:</P>
<P N="1">1. He shall be one of a <HI>Blameless Life;</HI> and therefore one that hath actually joined unto a <HI>particular Church,</HI> for Communion in all <HI>special Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He shall give the <HI>Triers</HI> an Account of the <HI>Principles,</HI> that act him, in his Desire to Preach the Gospel; which may satisfy their Judicious Charity, that he is acted by the <HI>Evan∣gelical Principles</HI> of Love to CHRIST and Souls, in his Intentions.</P>
<P N="3">3. He shall be <HI>tried,</HI> how far he is acquaint∣ed with the <HI>Three learned Languages,</HI> and with the <HI>Sciences</HI> commonly taught in the <HI>Academical Education:</HI> And so much Acquaintance there∣withal shall be required, as may be judged ab∣solutely needful for the Services whereto he he is designed.</P>
<P N="4">4. Before <HI>Three</HI> of the <HI>Triers</HI> at least, he shall Preach a <HI>Probationary Sermon,</HI> on a Text, at a <HI>Time,</HI> and in a <HI>Place,</HI> which <HI>they</HI> shall appoint; and they shall upon Hearing pronounce his Abi∣lities for <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Praying</HI> to be such as give them Satisfaction.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="120" REF="002775_0135_0FE63106BA362920"/>
5. He shall be examined, What Authors in <HI>Theology</HI> he has read; and he shall particularly make it evident, That he has considerately read, <HI>Ames</HI> his <HI>Medulla Theologiae:</HI> [Or, some other generally allowed <HI>Body of Divi∣nity.</HI>]</P>
<P N="6">6. His Abilities to <HI>Refute Errors</HI> are to be tried, by putting such Instances unto him, as the <HI>Triers</HI> may judge most convenient.</P>
<P N="7">7. He shall declare to the <HI>Triers</HI> his Adhe∣rence unto, <HI>the Confession of Faith,</HI> agreed by the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> and <HI>the Assembly of Divines</HI> at <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III.

<P N="4">IV. It is proposed, That if any <HI>Congregations</HI> be so unadvised, as to invite unto <HI>publick Preach∣ing</HI> any <HI>Candidate of the Ministry,</HI> who has avoid∣ed the <HI>Trial</HI> aforesaid, the <HI>Pastors</HI> of the Churches in the Neighbourhood, shall not only refuse to concur in the <HI>Ordination</HI> of a Person who has so <HI>shunned the Light,</HI> but also write unto the said <HI>Congregations</HI> a suitable <HI>Admonition</HI> for the <HI>Dis∣der,</HI> by which they thus expose themselves to the <HI>Devices of Satan.</HI></P>

V.

<HEAD>ARTICLE VII. The other Ecclesiastical OFFI∣CERS for the Assistence of the PASTORS.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1.

<P><PB N="122" REF="002775_0137_0FE63107C6CA3C48"/>
There has been much thought about the Of∣fice of those called, RULING-ELDERS, to as∣sist the <HI>Pastors,</HI> in the Inspection and Govern∣ment of the <HI>Churches.</HI></P>
<P>We may not altogether give that Report about the <HI>New English,</HI> which Deacon <HI>Hilary,</HI> a Writer of the IVth Century gives about the Primitive Churches. <HI>Ecclesia, ut Synagoga, Seniores habuit, quorum sine Consilio, nihil agebatur in Ecclesia, quod, qua Negligentia obsoleverit, nescio; nisi forte Docto∣rum Desidia, aut magu Superbia, dum soli volunt ali∣quid videri.</HI> But this may be reported, That be∣cause the <HI>Office</HI> has not been well <HI>understood,</HI> (and these <HI>Elders</HI> have not been considered as given to the <HI>Pastors</HI> meerly for <HI>Helps,</HI> as the <HI>Levites</HI> were to the <HI>Priests</HI> of old) nor have those <HI>few Churches</HI> that have maintained it, conformed unto what is practised (of a <HI>Biennial,</HI> or <HI>Triennial</HI> Choice, and this in a good <HI>Number</HI> too,) in the other <HI>Churches</HI> of the <HI>Reformation;</HI> it is now generally laid aside. There are <HI>few Churches,</HI> but what are, as many of the <HI>Primitive,</HI> at their first planting were, in the Condition mentioned by <HI>Tertullian; Ubi Ecclesiastici Ordinis non est Consessus, Sacerdos est ibi solus.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Platform</HI> asserts, an Office of <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> distinct from the <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>Pastor</HI> and <HI>Teacher;</HI> how∣ever, not <HI>so called,</HI> for to exclude the <HI>Pastor</HI> and <HI>Teacher</HI> from <HI>Ruling.</HI> But then it assigns a <HI>Work</HI> unto these, which it has happened sometimes, the Men whom the Churches have chosen, (and rarely have above <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two</HI> at a Time, and these <HI>for Life,</HI> been chosen in a Church) have been uncapable of managing, any otherwise than
<PB N="123" REF="002775_0138_0FE63107CA90E908"/>too clumsily, and so as hardly to preserve the <HI>Dig∣nity</HI> of the Administrations they have pretended to.</P>
<P>An Assembly of our <HI>Pastors,</HI> once published this as their Judgment;
<Q>That <HI>Ruling Elders</HI> are appointed for the Assistence of their <HI>Pastors,</HI> in the <HI>Government</HI> of their Churches, and the In∣spection of the Flocks. And though these Of∣ficers may not be furnished with all those <HI>At∣tainments</HI> which are necessary to a <HI>Pastor,</HI> yet if they are so accomplished, as that they may be <HI>Helps</HI> to their <HI>Pastor,</HI> in the Management of their <HI>Church Rule,</HI> they may be chosen thereun∣to with much Benefit and Advantage to the People of GOD. But, Whereas 'tis the Busi∣ness of a <HI>Ruling Elder,</HI> to assist his <HI>Pastor,</HI> in <HI>Vi∣siting</HI> the Distressed; <HI>Instructing</HI> the Ignorant; <HI>Reducing</HI> of the Erroneous; <HI>Comforting</HI> the Afflic∣ted; <HI>Rebuking</HI> the Unruly; <HI>Discovering</HI> the State of the whole Flock; Exercising the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the Gospel upon Offenders; and promoting the Desireable <HI>Growth</HI> of the Church; 'tis ne∣cessa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y that he be a Person of a Wisdom, Cou∣rage, Leisure, &amp; Exemplary Holiness &amp; Gravity, agreeable to such Employments.</Q></P>
<P>One is at a Loss about certain Passages in Antiquity. If the Five or Six Brethren, whom <HI>Clemens</HI> with his Church, sent with his Excellent Letter unto the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> were not such <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> yet <HI>Firmillian,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Caesa∣rea,</HI> in the Third Century, seems to join the <HI>Se∣niors</HI> (or, Elders) with the <HI>Pastors,</HI> and says, That at certain times, they <HI>met for to settle and or∣der
<PB N="124" REF="002775_0139_0FE6310987F18220"/>Matters committed unto their Care.</HI> And about fifty Years after, <HI>Mensurius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Carthage;</HI> having occasion to travel, committed some Trea∣sures of the Church unto certain <HI>Elders,</HI> who af∣terward proving Wicked Men. began the Schism of the <HI>Donatists.</HI> And in the Acts of the Justifi∣cation of <HI>Caecilian,</HI> which are more Ancient than the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> we read of <HI>Elders</HI> distinct from the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Priests. Austin</HI> also several times makes mention of <HI>Elders</HI> distinct from the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Churches: Particularly he does it in the Inscription of his CXXXVII. Epistle. Yea, in his XIX. Sermon on the Words of our Lord, [The <HI>Third</HI> in the <HI>Appendix</HI> of Tom. 10] he declares the Duty of their Employments. The Council of <HI>Carthage,</HI> A. C. 407. diverse times mentions these <HI>Elders,</HI> as defending the <HI>Rights</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> against the <HI>Bishops.</HI> Yea, we find them not Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inct in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> at the End of the <HI>Sixth Century.</HI></P>
<P>That which has almost extinguished them in this Country within the half of <HI>One Century,</HI> has been, the prevailing of such Sentiments as these, in very many of the <HI>Pastors.</HI></P>
<P>The only Scripture that seems plainly to assert that Office, is 1 Tim. V. 17. <HI>Let the Elders that Rule well be counted worthy of double Honour, especial∣ly they who labour in Word and Doctrine.</HI> But per∣haps upon mature Consideration, it will be found, That in the <HI>Primitive Churches,</HI> there were <HI>Pastors</HI> in two different Circumstances of Employment. First, there were <HI>Elders</HI> who in a more <HI>constant Way</HI> carried on the Duties of the <HI>Evangelical Ministry,</HI> with the gathered Churches of the
<PB N="125" REF="002775_0140_0FE631098C7EBEE8"/><HI>ful,</HI> and therein did <HI>preside Well.</HI> But at the same time it was necessary to <HI>Labour</HI> for the Conver∣sion of <HI>Infidels,</HI> of whom it could not be expected, that many of them would come unto the Assem∣blies of the Faithful. Wherefore to convert these, and spread the <HI>Nets of Salvation</HI> in the most like∣ly Places for them, which was then very much <HI>the Work of the Day,</HI> there were those who did <HI>La∣bour with Travelling</HI> (which the Word here used may import) for the <HI>Word and Dectrine,</HI> among the <HI>Infidels:</HI> And every ones sees why such <HI>La∣bourers</HI> as these are judged to be <HI>Worthy</HI> of a <HI>pecu∣liar Honour.</HI> As the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the Scriptures, are evidently the same, so it appears not, that there were any <HI>Presbyters</HI> known in the Scripture, who were not such as both <HI>Preached the Gospel,</HI> and administred the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of it. The <HI>Ruling Elders</HI> in the Churches of the <HI>Refor∣mation,</HI> seem to be akin to a sort of <HI>Elders</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were not Ordained (they say) by <HI>laying on of Hands,</HI> but only were Venerable for their Age, Discretion, and Gravity; and were called <HI>Zikne Hashuk,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Elders of the Street,</HI> or <HI>Vulgar Elders.</HI> Great Men, who yet are Zealous Maintainers of that <HI>Order</HI> which goes by the Name of RULING ELDERS [or, <HI>Seni∣ors,</HI>] in the Reformed Churches, are well aware of <HI>this.</HI> And therefore still to preserve this <HI>Use∣ful Order,</HI> they take the Method, which One, who may justly be called an <HI>Eagle Eyed</HI> as well as an <HI>Excellent</HI> Writer in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> has at length pitched upon. The <HI>Cyprianus Isotimus</HI> of that <HI>Marvellous Man,</HI> has these Passages.
<Q><PB N="126" REF="002775_0141_0FE6310F35C32F00"/>
Those <HI>Elders</HI> are the Representatives of the <HI>Sa∣cra Plebs</HI> or the Church, as she is opposed to, or distinguished from <HI>Church Officers</HI> properly so called; <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Deacons:</HI> And therefore they are not in a strict Sense <HI>Church-Officers.</HI> — The Church <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and the <HI>ne∣cessary means</HI> to preserve them, must stand on the same Foundation. And accordingly <HI>Blon∣del</HI> judges, 'tis most probable that in the Time of the Apostles, not the <HI>whole Multitude,</HI> but their <HI>Seniors,</HI> did convene for their Affairs. He believes, that the Protestant Churches of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> in their set∣ting up of <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> did introduce into the Church, a Practice truly <HI>Apostolic.</HI> — I can't indeed, during the III first Centuries, find ex∣press mention of these <HI>Seniors,</HI> or <HI>Ruling Elders.</HI> — Yet I am perswaded, that there were <HI>Lay-Seniors,</HI> that shared in the Management of Ec∣clesiastical Affairs, represented the People, and preserved their Liberties. The Writers of the 4th. and 5th. Ages, either expresly affirm it, or clearly suppose it. <HI>Ambrose</HI> or <HI>Hilary</HI> particular∣ly, and <HI>Optatus.</HI> — My Hypothesis disjoins these <HI>Elders</HI> from the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and makes them the Representatives of the <HI>People,</HI> and <HI>Guardians</HI> of their Liberties. Accordingly in the <HI>Acts of Purgation</HI> of <HI>Caecilian,</HI> which are Elder than the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> — we diverse times read of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and the <HI>Elders</HI> of the People. This is yielded by Bishop <HI>Whitgift,</HI> who says, <HI>I know, that in the 'Primitive Church, they had in every Church certain</HI> Seniors, <HI>to whom the Government of the Congregation was committed.</HI> And <HI>Saravia,</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="002775_0142_0FE6310F397F0650"/>who assents to <HI>Hilary</HI>'s Saying, <HI>That the Church had Elders,</HI> or Seniors, <HI>without whose Council no∣thing was done;</HI> and adds, <HI>Adjunguntur Pastoribus Ecclesiae tanquam Adsessores et Consiliari ut videant ne forte Potestate Ecclesiastica Pastores abutantur.</HI> The English <HI>Church Wardens,</HI> in <HI>Voetius</HI>'s Mind, are the Vestiges and Rubbish of those Ruling <HI>Seniors.</HI> This most necessary Ordinance, has in all well reformed Churches been carefully observed; and on the other hand most eagerly impugned by the <HI>Papists;</HI> as <HI>Schultingius</HI> and o∣thers cited by the most learned <HI>Voetius. Nor</HI> (they are the Words of the same excellent Per∣son) <HI>is this a Wonder, since nothing is more opposite unto the Papal Monarchy, and Antichristian Tyranny, than is the Institution of RULING ELDERS. Vo∣etius</HI> make the <HI>Elders</HI> a kind of <HI>Ephori,</HI> that is <HI>Preservers</HI> of the Churches Liberties, and <HI>In∣spectors</HI> over the Pastors. I'll shut up all (says Mr. <HI>Jameson</HI>) with the Words of the Learned and Venerable <HI>Beza;</HI> 'Tis the Churches great Concern for the keeping out of Tyranny, that some <HI>chosen out of the People,</HI> know what is done in the Consistories, and Ecclesiastical Jurisdic∣tion. As Anciently at <HI>Rome</HI> it was provided for the Restraining the Power of the Senate, that the <HI>Tribunes of the People</HI> should be present at it, and have Power of withstanding by a <HI>Negative Voice,</HI> the Senates Decrees.</Q></P>
<P>Some of our Churches do yet continue to <HI>Elect,</HI> and (with <HI>Imposition of Hands</HI>) to <HI>Ordain</HI> One or Two, or Three <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> and apprehend they find their Account in it, and good Services
<PB N="128" REF="002775_0143_0FE63115CFDE5CD8"/>done to the Interests of Piety. And these we will present with the Exhortation, which <HI>Poly∣carp</HI> gave to the <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the Church at <HI>Phi∣lippi.</HI>
<Q>Let the Elders be Tender and Merciful; Compassionate towards all; Reducing those that are in Error; Visiting all that are Weak; not Negligent of the Widow nor the Orphan, and him that is poor; but ever providing what is honest in the sight of GOD and Men; Ab∣staining from all Wrath, Respect of Persons, and Unrighteous Judgment; being far from Covetousness; not hastily believing a Report of any Man; not rigid in Judgment; Knowing that we are all Faulty and Obnoxious to Judg∣ment.</Q></P>
<P>They will also think of what <HI>Origen,</HI> in the third Century, declared then to be used in the Churches;
<Q>Persons established to take Notice of the Life and Conversation of those, who embrace the Christian Religion, and when they committed any Evil Actions, to expel them out of the Congregations; and receive with great Affection, those that lived well, and make them better from Day to Day.</Q></P>
<P>§. 2. The Office of DEACONS, to assist and relieve the <HI>Pastors,</HI> in all the <HI>Temporal Affairs</HI> of the Church, is in the <HI>New English</HI> Churches re∣tained, as was in the <HI>Primitive;</HI> where we find them <HI>Serving Tables;</HI> being as <HI>Ignatius</HI> (if it were <HI>he</HI>) expresses it. ΒΡΟΜΑΤΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΠΟΤΩΝ ΔΙΑΚΟΝΟΙ: The <HI>Deacons of Meats and Cups;</HI> that is to say, Those who prepared the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> for the
<PB N="129" REF="002775_0144_0FE63115D423C6E8"/><HI>Eucharist:</HI> and the Dispensers, as <HI>Origen</HI> expresses it, of the ΤΑ ΤΑΣ ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑΣ ΧΡΗΜΑΤΑ, <HI>Churches Money;</HI> (which ought to be) with the Advice of the <HI>Pastors.</HI></P>
<P>These are they who in the <HI>New English</HI> Chur∣ches, as well as in the <HI>Primitive,</HI> do as they did in <HI>Justin Martyr</HI>'s Time, <HI>deliver the Sacramental Bread and Wine unto the Communicants:</HI> (in which Action they sometimes call for Assistence from some other Brethren.) Herewithal they stand engaged, what they can, to free the Minister from all <HI>secular</HI> Disturbances and Avocations. For indeed, among the Churches in this Coun∣try <HI>Sacerdos in Foro,</HI> undergoes the <HI>Scourge of the Tongue,</HI> as being little better than <HI>Mercator in Tem∣plo.</HI> And yet it must be confessed that <HI>secular Digressions</HI> from their <HI>Sacred Imployments,</HI> have been too often forced upon their <HI>Ministers,</HI> by the In∣gratitude and Parsimony of the People, who have not always done their Duty to put their <HI>Ministers</HI> in the Condition mentioned by <HI>Cyprian,</HI> when he says, <HI>Qui in Ecclesia Domini Ordinatione Clerica promoventur, in nullo, ab Administratione Di∣vina avocentur, nec Molestiis et Negotiis Secularibus alligentur.</HI> But our People should hear the <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> and <HI>Martyr</HI> speaking in plain English. Says he,
<Q>Those who are promoted to Clerical Ordi∣nations should not be hindred in their Divine Administrations or encumbred with secular Concerns and Affairs; but, as Levites, receiv∣ing Subscriptions from the Brethren, depart not from the Altar and Sacrifices, but Night and Day attend upon Spiritual and Heavenly Administrations.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="002775_0145_0FE63117A4903AC0"/>
We return to our <HI>Deacons.</HI> They are, as he that goes under the Name of <HI>Ignatius</HI> calls them; ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑΣ ΘΕΟΥ ΥΠΕΡΗΤΑΙ, <HI>The Servants of the Church of GOD;</HI> and they are constituted as <HI>Eu∣sebius</HI> terms it, for the
ΥΠΕΡΗΣΙΑ ΤΟΥ ΚΟΙΝΟΥ <HI>Ser∣vice of the Publick.</HI> And if the
ΒΑΘΜΟΣ ΚΑΛΟΣ which we render <HI>a good Degree,</HI> assigned unto faithful <HI>Deacons</HI> by the Apostle, mean, as 'tis by some Critics imagined, <HI>A Seat of some Emi∣nency in the Church Assemblies,</HI> the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> always have such a <HI>Seat,</HI> still a lit∣tle below the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> facing the Congregation.</P>
<P>But it is after this Manner that they are In∣troduced into it. The <HI>Pastor</HI> desires the <HI>Brethren,</HI> to chuse a fit Number of Persons, <HI>from among themselves,</HI> for the Office of <HI>Deacons</HI> among them. And some little while after this Desire has been signified, the <HI>Brethren</HI> bring in their <HI>Votes,</HI> by Pa∣pers, which have written on them the Names of the Persons, which each Man would have to be chosen, according to the Number first agreed up∣on.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> hereupon calls upon some of the chief Brethren to count the <HI>Votes;</HI> and from the the Report which they give him, he then de∣clares whom they find the Major <HI>Vote</HI> fallen upon. If they be any of them (which <HI>rarely</HI> if <HI>ever</HI> hap∣pens) Persons against whom <HI>he</HI> hath an Objec∣tion that cannot easily be removed, he advises them to <HI>another Choice.</HI> But if he hath nothing to object, he applies himself unto the Persons chosen, with this Request, That they would so far ac∣cept the <HI>Call</HI> of the Church, as to do the <HI>Work</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="002775_0146_0FE63117A8516D28"/>expected from the <HI>Deacons,</HI> until such Time, as the Church may proceed, unto the full Observa∣tion of the Apostolical Direction, <HI>Let the Deacons first be proved; then let them use the Office of a Deacon.</HI></P>
<P>It has been observed, That because in our Translation, it is enumerated among the Qualifi∣cations of a <HI>Deacon.</HI> [1 Tim. III. 2.] <HI>Even so must their Wives be grave, not Slanderers, sober, faithful in all things:</HI> And the <HI>French</HI> Churches therefore make it an Article of their Discipline,
<Q>That as much as possible may be avoided, there should not be elected Elders and Deacons of the Church, those which had Wives contrary to the true Religion</Q>: When <HI>Deacons</HI> are chosen in the Churches, 'tis often enquired, Whether their <HI>Wives</HI> are qualified as has been directed? But this has been from a common Mistake about the Meaning of the Text; which does not say a Word about the <HI>Deacons Wife,</HI> any more than the <HI>Pastors,</HI> but only says, <HI>Let the Women</HI> [ΓΥΝΑΙΚΕΣ] <HI>be Grave.</HI> — Which <HI>Women</HI> are the <HI>Deaconesses;</HI> Officers not hitherto employed in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Deacons Elect,</HI> when they have in a Lauda∣ble Behaviour, for some time given Demonstra∣tion of their <HI>Ability,</HI> and <HI>Fidelity,</HI> do in some of the Churches become <HI>Deacons Ordained</HI> with <HI>Im∣position of Hands.</HI> Though in many of these Churches, This <HI>Rite</HI> of their Confirmation, is fallen into such a Desuetude, as it is in other Churches of the <HI>Reformation.</HI> One Reason for this Omission, has been because in many of our Churches, the <HI>Deacons</HI> do little other Work, than
<PB N="132" REF="002775_0147_0FE6311E4678EBE0"/>provide the <HI>Elements</HI> for the <HI>Eucharist;</HI> and a <HI>so∣lemn Ordination</HI> to nothing but <HI>this,</HI> appears hard∣ly a Congruity. But when an <HI>Ordination</HI> is in∣tended, some <HI>Lord's Day</HI> (or <HI>Fast Day</HI>) being be∣fore signified by the Pastor for the Purpose, when the Day arrives the Pastor makes the <HI>Consumma∣tion</HI> of this Affair, to be among the other Exer∣cises of the Day. He declares, that by the Chur∣ches <HI>Designation,</HI> such and such Persons are now to be <HI>confirmed</HI> in the Office of <HI>Deacons,</HI> if there now appear nothing to obstruct it. He there∣fore proposes unto the Brethren of the Church, [suppose <HI>Two</HI> to be now concerned:] <HI>That if they do still maintain and will now renew, their Choice of the Two Beloved Brethren,</HI> A. B. and C. D. <HI>to the Office of</HI> Deacons <HI>in the Church, their uplifted Hands may signify it.</HI> This being done, he ad∣dresses himself unto the Persons chosen; desiring them to intimate their Acceptance of the <HI>Churches Choice;</HI> which they successively do, with modest Expressions of their <HI>Willingness</HI> and <HI>Readiness,</HI> to do the Church all possible Service, and their Sense of their own being <HI>unable</HI> as well as <HI>unworthy</HI> to serve the Flock of our Glorious LORD, but re∣questing therefore the <HI>Prayers</HI> of all the Faithful for them, that they may faithfully discharge eve∣ry Trust that shall be reposed in them.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Pastor,</HI> taking the most convenient <HI>Place</HI> that he can find in the Assembly for it, calls them to him, and laying his <HI>Two Hands</HI> on the <HI>Heads</HI> of the <HI>Two Persons</HI> (if there be <HI>so many,</HI> and when there is but <HI>one Pasio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> there can be <HI>no more</HI> Ordained in <HI>One Action,</HI>) he first makes a
<PB N="133" REF="002775_0148_0FE6311E4BCB68C0"/>short <HI>Prayer;</HI> Acknowledging the Glorie of a Great SAVIOUR, and His <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> in His Churches, and His <HI>Favours</HI> to that particular Church; and petition∣ing for His Countenance to the <HI>Present Action.</HI> He then with his <HI>Hands</HI> yet imposed, applies himself to them with a <HI>Charge</HI> to this Purpose.</P>
<P><Q>Whereas You, upon whom these Hands are now imposed, have been chosen to the Office of Deacons in this Church of the Lord, I do now in the Name of that Glorious Lord, and on the behalf of this People, solemnly set you apart unto the Discharge of that Office; And before the Great GOD our SAVIOUR, and before His Elect Angels, I do solemnly charge you, to do all the Work of your Office, with all good Integrity: In the Doing whereof, you are to be Grave, not Double-tongue'd, not gi∣ven to much Wine, not greedy of filthy Lucre: You are to hold the Mystery of Faith in a Pure Conscience, and to be blameless in well using the Office of a Deacon: You are to rule your own Houses well, and so to behave your selves that you may have great Boldness in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ; Unto whose Grace you are now to be recommended.</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon in another short <HI>Prayer,</HI> with his <HI>Hands</HI> yet imposed, he recommends them to the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD, and Petitions, and Pronounces the <HI>Blessing</HI> of Heaven upon them.</P>
<P>Thus it is that the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> are <HI>Organized.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE VIII. The DISCIPLINE with which the Churches are kept in their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Order.</HI></HEAD>
<P>§. 1. THE Question has been considered in the Churches of <HI>New-England, Whe∣ther the Pastor of a Church may not occasionally dis∣pense the Seals of the Covenant in another Church, up∣on the Peoples Desiring of it?</HI></P>
<P>And it has been very publickly and practical∣ly answered, <HI>That they may.</HI></P>
<P>As a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel, or one solemnly set apart for Evangelical Administrations, does retain his Character, when preaching in other Congregations, besides that which is his <HI>immedi∣ate Charge:</HI> The Words of Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> are certain∣ly to be allowed of;
<Q>Altho' we have no Con∣cern in the Figment of an <HI>Indelible Character accompanying Sacred Orders,</HI> yet we do not think, that the <HI>Pastoral Office</HI> is such a Thing as a Man must leave behind him every time he goeth from Home: For my own part, if I did not think my self bound to <HI>preach as a Minister Authorized</HI> in all Places, and on all Occasions,
<PB N="135" REF="002775_0150_0FE6311F5591FCE8"/>when I am called thereunto, I think, I should never Preach any more in this World: —</Q> So, 'tis no where scrupled, that a Pastor of a Church, may administer the <HI>Special</HI> and <HI>Sealing</HI> Ordinances, to the Members of another Church, coming to occasional Communion with him in his own; and if they should <HI>All</HI> of them (even their <HI>whole Church</HI>) so com to him, he will not refuse them. Certainly then, he may as well go to that <HI>other Church,</HI> and administer the Sacred Or∣dinances to them in the <HI>Place</HI> where they assem∣ble, if it be desired from him: It appears not, why the <HI>Presence of his own Flock</HI> should be neces∣sary to Legitimate such an Administration? Why, any more than the <HI>Presence of the whole Flock</HI> to which any particular Member belongs, to whom he occasionally administers the <HI>Seals,</HI> when he comes to him in a <HI>Transient</HI> Way for it? The <HI>Consent</HI> and <HI>Request</HI> of the Persons concerned, <HI>Pro hac Vice,</HI> sufficiently enables him. The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> herein differ from the <HI>Rigid Separatists,</HI> your <HI>Canne</HI> and Company; and it is expresly provided in their <HI>Platform,</HI> That <HI>Churches may lend a Minister to supply the Place of an Absent or a Sick Minister of another Church for a needful Season.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the more famous Divines, at the first Settlement of these Churches, publickly declared, themselves, for the Affirmative of the Question. And long after them, Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> gave it under his Hand, with an, <HI>Ita sentio, ita sensi;</HI>
<Q>That every true Minister, actually such to his own Church, is <HI>Medium Applicabile,</HI> an Instrument
<PB N="136" REF="002775_0151_0FE631234B9EE638"/>that may apply to any Ministerial Act out of his own Church, in any other Church, if he be there unto called by them.</Q> Yea, when <HI>Po∣lycarp,</HI> a Scholar of the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> and one Ordained (as <HI>Jerom,</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> and others testify) by the Apostles themselves, came from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> for the Composing of some Differences, <HI>Anicetus</HI> the Pastor of the Church there, to express his Love and Honour for him, requested him to administer the <HI>Eucharist</HI> unto the Church, where he now appeared but as a Traveller; and, <HI>he did it.</HI> Now, <HI>Irenaeus</HI> assures us, <HI>Polycarp</HI> always taught the Churches to <HI>Ob∣serve those things which he learned from the Apostles themselves, and nothing else.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, In these Churches, not only does a <HI>Pastor</HI> coming occasionally to an Assembly, administer the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the Lord, unto any <HI>Infant</HI> of the Flock that may be brought for it, if their own Pastor be out of the Way; But al∣so, upon the <HI>Desire</HI> of a <HI>Destitute Flock</HI> for it, it is allowed that a <HI>Neighbouring Pastor</HI> may go and administer the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord unto them. Only, the Practise is the less frequent, because the Churches would not encourage a <HI>Destitute Flock,</HI> in any thing that may abate their Sense of the Necessity lying upon them, to make as much haste as they can, out of their <HI>Inorganic,</HI> and <HI>Un∣comfortable,</HI> Circumstances.</P>
<P>§. 2. When the <HI>Communicants</HI> in these Chur∣ches have Occasion for to <HI>Travel,</HI> the Pastors give them LETTERS OF RECOMMENDA∣TION
<PB N="137" REF="002775_0152_0FE631234F852500"/>(perhaps not unlike the <HI>Pacific Letters</HI> without which the Primitive Churches would not receive <HI>travelling Strangers,</HI>) Or, Testimonials of this Importance? <HI>That — the Bearer hereof having been admitted into the Fellowship of the Church</HI> [in the Place mentioned] <HI>and behaved himself inoffensively therein, is upon that Account recommended unto Communion in special Ordinances, with any Chur∣ches of our LORD, walking in the Faith and Order of the Gospel, wherefoever he may have Opportunity in the Travels now before him, to desire it.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed we find, it was a Decree of a <HI>Carthagi∣nian</HI> Council,
<Q>That no one should communi∣cate in another Church, without a Letter from the Bishop of his own Church.</Q> The Chur∣ches of <HI>New-England</HI> require it not, from such as are otherwise known sufficiently, but where Persons cannot be well known without it.</P>
<P>They also admit unto <HI>Occasional Communion,</HI> those who have any <HI>living Testimonies</HI> of their having been Communicants in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> or any Reforming Churches in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> or elsewhere, tho' they should happen to be not furnished with <HI>written Credentials.</HI></P>
<P>But when a Brother in a Church alters and removes his Habitation, and intends an <HI>Abode</HI> with the Church, whereto he would be <HI>Recom∣mended;</HI> or, for weighty Reasons finds it neces∣sary to consult his own <HI>Edification,</HI> in changing a <HI>Society;</HI> he applies himself unto his own Pastor for LETTERS OF DISMISSION, or for some <HI>Authentic Signification</HI> of the Church, whereto he has hitherto belonged, allowing a <HI>Translation</HI> of
<PB N="138" REF="002775_0153_0FE631252E9BA400"/>his more <HI>immediate Relation,</HI> unto the Church he would more constantly sit down withal. The <HI>Literae Dimissoriae</HI> mentioned by some old Coun∣cils, as peculiar to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> are directed for the <HI>Brethren.</HI> Too many removing without some such <HI>Instrument,</HI> consigning the <HI>Church Watch</HI> up∣on the Remover, from one Church to another; This <HI>Omission</HI> has been an Occasion of some <HI>Dis∣orders,</HI> and caused some Difficulty in the Executi∣on of their <HI>Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>And hence it comes to pass that sometimes a Person does for many Years enjoy a <HI>constant Communion</HI> with a Church at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, and yet remains uncapable of <HI>Acting</HI> and <HI>Voting</HI> with the Church as a Member of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church Covenant</HI> being but the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> applied unto the special Purposes of a <HI>Church State,</HI> and it being a <HI>Duty</HI> of that <HI>Covenant,</HI> for a Man to join himself with some <HI>Christian Society,</HI> in observing the Laws of our SAVIOUR, where he does in his own <HI>private Judgment of Discretion</HI> think that he can best pursue and attain the <HI>Ends</HI> of that <HI>Covenant;</HI> a Man joining to any one <HI>par∣ticular Church,</HI> does in effect <HI>confess</HI> thus much, with a <HI>Choice</HI> thereupon of that <HI>Christian Society,</HI> whereto he now becomes related, as answer∣ing that Character.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when a Person judges that he can with more <HI>Edification,</HI> enjoy the Blessings of the <HI>New Covenant</HI> in <HI>another Society,</HI> than that with which he has hitherto walked, except the Socie∣ty have any <HI>just Exception</HI> against his <HI>Judging</HI> so, he does well to ask a <HI>Dismission,</HI> and they of whom he does ask it, ought then to <HI>give</HI> it. If
<PB N="139" REF="002775_0154_0FE63125325A2300"/>they <HI>Refuse</HI> it, a <HI>Council</HI> of Neighbour Churches applied unto, may <HI>order</HI> it.</P>
<P>But now, the <HI>Pastor</HI> having first asked and gained the Consent of the <HI>Church</HI> unto it, he writes to the <HI>other Church,</HI> something of this Im∣portance;
<Q>That [such an One] having for allowable Reasons requested a Dismission from this Church to that, it is hereby Testifyed on on his behalf, that he has been for some time, a Communicant with them in all special Ordi∣nances, and by a good Conversation in CHRIST, approved himself worthy of it. But now in answer to his Just Request, they Dis∣miss him to the more immediate Fellowship of them with whom he is now to Reside; En∣treating them to receive him into their Fel∣lowship, and extend that Love and Care unto him which is directed in the Rules of the Gos∣pel. So with Wishes and Prayers for their Pros∣perity, the Pastor <HI>Subscribes,</HI> with the Consent of the Brethren.</Q></P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> are encourag∣ed in such Usages, by the Discipline of the <HI>French Protestants,</HI> whereof it was an Article,
<Q>That when any one for his necessary Affairs was forced to Travel, Recommendatory Letters to the next Church, were to be Asked and Granted.</Q> And the Synod of <HI>Sardis,</HI> A. C. 347. Established the the Use of such <HI>Letters</HI> in the Churches of those Early Days. In the <HI>Primitive Churches</HI> they were called, <HI>Literae Communicatoriae. Tertullian</HI> calls them, <HI>Literas Pacis:</HI> And the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches called them, <HI>Systatic Epistles.</HI> That fa∣mous Dutchman, <HI>Hornbeck,</HI> does commend the
<PB N="140" REF="002775_0155_0FE6312C3449DD40"/>Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> for the Use of such <HI>Letters.</HI> And unto that Question, <HI>Whether such Letters are not requisite in the Translation of Members from one Church unto another?</HI> the Incomparable <HI>Voetius</HI> answers, <HI>Ita habet ordo Ecclesiasticus, et lau∣dabili more obtinet in Ecclesiis Belgicis. Church Order</HI> does require them; and the <HI>Dutch Churches</HI> do observe them.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as many <HI>Church-Members,</HI> when they have Removed unto other Churches, without a Prospect of a <HI>Return,</HI> have been too Negligent in seeking for an Explicit and Orderly <HI>Transla∣tion,</HI> it is a Practice taken up, That the Churches Desire and Entrust their <HI>Pastors</HI> to send unto such Persons the <HI>Dismission</HI> which they should have asked for, and oblige them therewith to join themselves in the most regular Manner to the Churches, with which they have now a fixed A∣bode; and let them know, it will be an Offence, if they do, without a very valid Reason, delay to do it.</P>
<P>He that has these <HI>Letters of Dismission,</HI> is yet <HI>Actually a Member</HI> of the Church that gives them, until he be actually joined unto another; capa∣ble of a <HI>Voting</HI> with it, and liable to the <HI>Censures</HI> of it. But being thus furnished with <HI>Letters,</HI> like those written of old, on the behalf of <HI>Apollos</HI> to the Disciples of <HI>Achaia, Exhorting them to receive him;</HI> or like these written for <HI>Marcus</HI> to the <HI>Co∣lossians;</HI> or, like those for <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be</HI> to the <HI>Remans;</HI> he carries them to the <HI>Pastor</HI> of the Church where he now resides; and the <HI>Pastor</HI> propounds to the Church the Desire of this Person: Whereupon, if no Objection occur, he <HI>reads</HI> unto the Church
<PB N="141" REF="002775_0156_0FE6312C385A0A68"/>the <HI>Letters of Dismission,</HI> and puts them upon signi∣fying their Willingness to receive the Person thus <HI>dismissed</HI> unto their Communion, by <HI>lifting up their Hands.</HI> This being done, he repeats unto the Person, the <HI>Substance</HI> of the <HI>Church-Covenant,</HI> and upon his Consent thereunto, he declares the <HI>Pro∣mise</HI> of the Church to acknowledge him with all Christian Regards in their <HI>Sacred Fellowship.</HI></P>
<P>They that have gone yet no further than the <HI>Covenant of Baptism,</HI> for themselves and theirs, up∣on a Removal are to carry some <HI>Certificate</HI> from their <HI>Pastor</HI> unto him under whose Ministry they are now to reside; which qualifies them to de∣mand <HI>Baptism</HI> for their Children, which may be there born unto them: and also entitles the Church there, to proceed with <HI>Rebukes</HI> upon them in Case of their falling into any <HI>Scanda∣lous Offences.</HI></P>
<P>§. 3. <HI>In the Primitive Church there was a Godly Discipline, that such Persons as were notorious Sinners, were put to open Penance in this World, that their Souls may be saved in the Day of the Lord, and that others admonished by their Exemple, might be more a∣fraid to offend.</HI> Now as the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> were at first planted, partly on the De∣sign of Obtaining and Maintaining the Exercise of such a <HI>Discipline;</HI> A Design for which they ap∣prehended, they had a sufficient <HI>Warrant</HI> of our SAVIOUR; So this <HI>Discipline</HI> has been hitherto more or less exercised.</P>
<P>If one under the <HI>Covenant</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the Church, fall into a <HI>Scandalous Transgressun</HI> a∣gainst
<PB N="142" REF="002775_0157_0FE6312E284236A0"/>the Laws of our Holy Redeemer, and the Transgression be <HI>at once,</HI> and <HI>at first</HI> a Matter of <HI>publick Fame,</HI> the <HI>Pastor</HI> upon the <HI>Cry,</HI> reckons it his Duty to <HI>Enquire</HI> into it, and bring it imme∣diately under an <HI>Ecclesiastical Cognizance.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Primitive Churches,</HI> we find not only <HI>Schism, Idolatry, Heresy, Covetousness, Gluttony, Drunkenness, Fornication,</HI> and <HI>Adultery,</HI> expresly a∣mong <HI>Censurable Evils,</HI> [Quaere, How did they convict any Man of <HI>Covetousness;</HI> a Fault which ordinarily no Man ever thinks himself guilty of!] but also as <HI>Origen</HI> writes, <HI>All other Sins whatsoever. Cyprian</HI> therefore tells us, That not only, <HI>Gravis∣sima et extrema Delicta,</HI> Grosser Offences, but also, <HI>Minora Delicta,</HI> lesser ones, were <HI>Censured</HI> among them. The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have no express and agreed <HI>Catalogue</HI> of the <HI>Crimes,</HI> that shall expose to <HI>Censures,</HI> except what is in the <HI>Bible</HI> it self: But the Rule which they profess, is, That an <HI>Ecclesiastical Animadversion</HI> belongs to such <HI>plain Trespasses</HI> against the Rules of a <HI>Godly,</HI> and a <HI>Sober,</HI> and a <HI>Righteous</HI> Life, as we may <HI>just∣ly Judge,</HI> that a Person under our Measures of <HI>Illumination</HI> cannot <HI>obstinately persist in,</HI> without forfeiting an Interest in the <HI>Kingdom of GOD.</HI> Such <HI>Opinions,</HI> and such <HI>Practices,</HI> as it may be our Duty to believe Consistent with true PIETY, the <HI>Censures</HI> of the Churches do not animadvert upon. The Evangelical <HI>Church State,</HI> being in some sort the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> endeavour to make theirs a <HI>Visi∣ble Sermon</HI> to the World, upon the Requisites of Mens being received into <HI>Heaven</HI> at the last. As in their <HI>Admissions</HI> they study Practically to
<PB N="143" REF="002775_0158_0FE6312E2BFFF250"/>declare, <HI>Who shall abide in the Tabernacle of the Lord, and who shall dwell in his holy Hill;</HI> So in their <HI>Exclusions,</HI> 'tis their study Practically to de∣clare, <HI>What crooked Ways they are, which will pro∣cure Men to be led forth with the Workers of Iniquity;</HI> to declare, <HI>Who are those Workers of Deceit, which our Lord will not have to dwell in His House.</HI> They have been willing to make <HI>Origen</HI>'s Declaration,
<Q>We use our utmost Endeavour, that our Assem∣blies may be composed of Wise and Good Men.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, while no body questions, Whether pro∣fane <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Cursing,</HI> evident <HI>Sabbath-break∣ing, Drunkenness, Fighting, Fornication</HI> and all Scan∣dalous <HI>Unchastities, Cheating, Stealing,</HI> an Aban∣donment unto <HI>Idleness, Lying,</HI> unrighteous <HI>Defa∣mations,</HI> and such <HI>Heresies</HI> as manifestly overturn the Foundations of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> and of all PIETY, are <HI>Censurable Evils;</HI> the Churches have sometimes had some Difficulties, about <HI>Pre∣cocious Nativites.</HI> But if a Child evidently come to the <HI>Growth</HI> which <HI>Nine Months,</HI> are ordinarily al∣lowed for, be born within about <HI>Seven Months</HI> after Marriage, it is ordinarily expected, that the Fault of an <HI>Unlawful Congress</HI> be publickly and penitently acknowledged; except the sus∣pected Persons offer a Purgation by an <HI>Oath,</HI> or a Declaration that shall be equivalent, for their Innocency. But the <HI>Birth</HI> may be so Pre∣mature, that no such <HI>Purgation</HI> may be admitted of.</P>
<P>But a <HI>scandalous Offence</HI> against <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> arising, 'tis thus proceeded with.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="002775_0159_0FE6313354DE77E0"/>
The <HI>Pastor</HI> sends for the <HI>Delinquent,</HI> and usually he desires a few of the <HI>chief Brethren</HI> to be with him in the Action; and enquiring into the <HI>Me∣rit of the Cause,</HI> he finds one of these to be neces∣sary. Either the <HI>Delinquent</HI> manifesteth himself so sensible of his <HI>Miscarriage,</HI> that only a <HI>Publick Acknowledgement</HI> before the whole Church is to be expected from him; or else there is yet manifest that <HI>hardness of Heart,</HI> that bespeaks for him a <HI>pub∣lick Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>When 'tis judged that a public ACKNOW∣LEDGEMENT, may make the <HI>Plaister</HI> for the <HI>Wounds</HI> which the Transgressor has given to Reli∣gion as <HI>broad as the Sore,</HI> he is put either upon <HI>Writ∣ing</HI> of his <HI>Acknowledgement,</HI> (which is most usual) or upon <HI>speaking</HI> of it, as 'tis foreseen will be most for Edification. And then in some Congrega∣tion of the Faithful, either the <HI>Church alone</HI> (which is thought most Adviseable where the Neighbourhood is very Populous, and full of Strangers) or the <HI>Rest</HI> of the Neighbourhood staying with the <HI>Church</HI> (which is the Custom in most Places;) the <HI>Pastor</HI> gives the <HI>Church</HI> a true Report of the <HI>Scandal,</HI> and adds his Hope of the Man's having Repenced of it; who now appears before them, to testify it with a <HI>Confession</HI> proper to the Occasion, which is then exhibited. Thus, there was an <HI>Exomologesis</HI> enjoined on the <HI>Penitents</HI> in the Primitive Churches; and there was that whereof <HI>Tertullian</HI> so expresses himself, <HI>Satisfactio Confessione disponitur, Confessione Poenitentia nascitur.</HI> This being done, the <HI>Pastor</HI> puts it un∣to the Vote of their uplisted Hands, <HI>Whether they
<PB N="145" REF="002775_0160_0FE6313358C8C1D0"/>accept the Satisfaction which has been thus offered by the Repenting Brother before them, and are willing to restore him to their Favour and Fellowship?</HI> Which being signified, the <HI>Paster</HI> then makes a loving and faithful Speech unto the <HI>Restored Person;</HI> mag∣nifying the Mercy of GOD unto the <HI>Penitent,</HI> and therewith directing and exciting of him to improve what has now occurred, for his more <HI>circumspect Walk</HI> all the Remainder of his <HI>Pilgri∣mage;</HI> And then unto <HI>the rest</HI> of the Assembly, to take notice what those Evils are which they now see must be <HI>repented</HI> of, and <HI>Watch</HI> and <HI>Pray</HI> that they may not fall into them.</P>
<P>Where 'tis judged that a publick ADMONI∣TION is needful, the <HI>Pastor</HI> warns the <HI>Offender</HI> to give his Attendance upon the Church at the Time that he prefixes unto him; and in some <HI>Congregation</HI> of the Faithful, as before, he lays be∣fore the <HI>Church,</HI> a short, plain, full Narrative of the <HI>Offence,</HI> which the Brother now before him has fallen into; with the <HI>Testimonies</HI> of <HI>it,</HI> and of the <HI>Unsuccessfulness</HI> which hath hitherto been up∣on the Means to bring him unto a due Remorse for it; Wherefore he also now calls upon the Person, to offer any further <HI>Tokens</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> if there be with him any to be offered.</P>
<P>Thus, among these Churches, as well as among the Churches in <HI>Origen</HI>'s Time, the Delinquent must appear, <HI>Before the whole Church.</HI></P>
<P>If the Person do out of <HI>Contempt</HI> refuse to make his <HI>Appearance,</HI> the Pastor moves the Church to concur (after some further Exercise of <HI>Patience,</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="002775_0161_0FE6313526ED2238"/>if in their Lenity they think it necessary) unto his <HI>Excommunication.</HI></P>
<P>If he do now appear, and give such Expressions of <HI>Repentance,</HI> that the <HI>Pastor</HI> with the <HI>Brethren</HI> conclude his Heart come to the Frame it should be in, and the Honour of the Gospel sufficiently vindicated, they do then by a <HI>Vote</HI> signify their Acceptance of him; Whereupon the <HI>Pastor</HI> makes a <HI>Speech</HI> unto him, and unto the rest of the Assembly, proper for the Occasion.</P>
<P>But if his <HI>Repentance,</HI> upon its being weighed in the Ballance, <HI>be found Wanting,</HI> the <HI>Pastor</HI> pro∣pounds it unto the <HI>Brethren,</HI> that they may pro∣ceed unto a more solemn <HI>Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>In the sad Cases of <HI>Censures,</HI> it has been tho't an <HI>Indecency,</HI> to ask for the Vote of <HI>Uplifted Hands:</HI> But the <HI>Pastor</HI> chuses to tell the <HI>Brethren,</HI> that if no Objection be made against the <HI>Proceeding,</HI> he shall <HI>take their Silence for a loud Expression of their Concurrence.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon, either at this Time or at some o∣ther appointed by the <HI>Pastor,</HI> the Offender stands forth in the <HI>Christian Assembly;</HI> and the <HI>Pastor</HI> distinctly sets before him his <HI>Faults,</HI> with the se∣veral <HI>Rules</HI> in the Gospel, which have in his <HI>Faults</HI> been violated, concluding with Terms of this Importance.</P>
<P><Q>Wherefore in the Name of the most Glorious GOD our SAVIOUR, (which Name you have Dishonoured by Sinning against him;) and with the Concurrence of this His People (a People that long to see you recovered out of the Sinful Distemper now upon you;) I AD∣MONISH you, to Repent of the Scandals
<PB N="147" REF="002775_0162_0FE631352C8114E8"/>which we have seen proved against you, as well as of the more secret Faults, by which you may have provoked the Holy One to leave you to what is more openly Scandalous. I ADMO∣NISH you, to repair unto the Blood of the Redeemer, that you may be cleansed from all your Sins, in that Fountain set open for Sin and for Uncleanness. I ADMONISH you, to cry mightily unto the Spirit of the Lord, for that new and soft Heart, that shall incline you, not only to confess your Sin with unfeigned Sorrow, but also to forsake it with Eternal De∣testation. I signify unto you, that as there is Grace enough in our Great SAVIOUR for you, if you return to him, so upon such a Re∣turn, this Flock of his will make you some Re∣presentation of His Grace, by renewing the Marks of their Favour to you. But I signify unto you, that until we see good Symptoms of a Penitent Heart upon you, We SUSPEND you from the Priviledges of our Sacred Fellow∣ship; and if you continue Impenitent, we must proceed unto a further Declaration of that Cen∣sure, which will be a Terrible Representation of your Banishment from the Kingdom of GOD. GOD forbid that it should come to this! That it may not come to this, we will now pour out our most affectionate Supplica∣tions for you.</Q></P>
<P>So the Pastor makes a pathetical <HI>Prayer</HI> for the recovering of the fallen Sinner, and a <HI>Blessing</HI> upon the <HI>Censure</HI> now applied unto him, and upon the <HI>Warning</HI> which the whole Assembly has therein Received.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="002775_0163_0FE6313C747C62D8"/>
Perhaps he thinks it also proper to make a short Speech unto the Assembly, directing a <HI>Right Improvement</HI> of the whole Transaction.</P>
<P>If the Person by some late <HI>Removal</HI> reside at so considerable a Distance from the Church, that he cannot well attend, then, upon a full Proof of the <HI>Scandal</HI> against him, the Church agrees to send unto him an <HI>Admonition</HI> in a <HI>Letter,</HI> which the <HI>Pastor</HI> forms and signs accordingly.</P>
<P>When a Person has thus received an <HI>Admoniti∣on</HI> for a <HI>Scandal,</HI> the <HI>Private Christians</HI> who dwell near him, reckon it their Duty, by <HI>Visiting</HI> of him, and by <HI>Discoursing</HI> with him, to prosecute the <HI>good Effects</HI> thereof upon him.</P>
<P>Where a <HI>Scandalous Transgression</HI> is known only to <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two,</HI> the Proceedings of the Persons that know it, are the same, that they are in the Case of a <HI>Personal Injury:</HI> The Steps directed in the XVIII. Ch. of <HI>Mathew.</HI> He that knows the Offence, first of all <HI>himself</HI> goes to the Offender, and seriously endeavours to bring him to <HI>Repen∣tance.</HI> If the Offender be <HI>Obstinate,</HI> he then (hav∣ing <HI>Proof</HI> to convict him) takes one or two <HI>Bre∣thren</HI> with him, and renews his Endeavours that the Man may come to Repentance. If this be ineffectual, <HI>They</HI> carry the Complaint unto the <HI>Pastor,</HI> who pursues the Designs of <HI>Humiliation</HI> on the Soul of the Offender. If the Man does now <HI>Relent,</HI> and the Offence be still in a sure Way to be <HI>kept private,</HI> the Satisfaction thus <HI>privately given,</HI> is taken up withal. But if either the Man continue <HI>Impenitent,</HI> or the Matter have so taken Air, as to be a Matter of <HI>common Fame,</HI> and the
<PB N="149" REF="002775_0164_0FE6313C78284050"/><HI>Talk of the People,</HI> then it falls into the Course, that such a Matter is to be treated withal.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Repentance</HI> of a Person duely <HI>admo∣nished</HI> has been a competent Measure of Time waited for, and no <HI>Fruits of Repentance</HI> are found upon him, the Church passes on to that HIGH∣EST CENSURE, which is by <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Alex∣andria</HI> called, <HI>A Driving away from the Church;</HI> By <HI>Tertullian, An Abjection and a Depulsion from the Church;</HI> By <HI>Cyprian, A Separation from the Church, and an Ejection out of it.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, in some <HI>Atrocious Crimes,</HI> wherein the most <HI>severe Testimonies</HI> against the things, whereof the Holy Son of GOD has declared, <HI>I hate them,</HI> ap∣pear necessary to rescue the Church from <HI>His Wrath,</HI> and from an <HI>evil Report</HI> in the World, and to break the <HI>Heart of Stone</HI> in the Criminal, the Churches do sometimes proceed, <HI>ipso Facto,</HI> to an <HI>Excommunication.</HI></P>
<P>But in these Churches, the Difference between the <HI>Lesser Excommunication</HI> and the <HI>Greater Excom∣munication,</HI> has appeared so very little, that the <HI>Suspension</HI> laid upon an Offender, at his <HI>Admonition</HI> is often stopped at, without going any further. The Order, <HI>Put away the wicked Person,</HI> is therein complied withal.</P>
<P>But there are <HI>Degrees of Solemnity</HI> in <HI>putting a∣way</HI> such an one; and the Sentence called, <HI>An EXCOMMUNICATION,</HI> is to be more formally pronounced upon the just Occasions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> never proceeds unto it, without the Concurrence of the <HI>Brethren;</HI> And we know that in <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Age, the Offenders pleaded their Cause, <HI>Apud universam Plebem;</HI> and an <HI>Excommu∣nication</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="002775_0165_0FE6313D82BA0F20"/>was ordered, <HI>Secundum Plebis divina Suffra∣gia.</HI></P>
<P>In parallelling this Way of <HI>New-England,</HI> we will for Brevity, only take Advantage of a Quo∣tation from an Eminent <HI>Scotch Presbyterian,</HI> even the Pious and the Learned <HI>Rutherford,</HI> whose Words are these.
<Q>Grave <HI>Beza, Calvin, Bucer, Bullinger, Melancthon, Bucan, Paraeus, Rivetus, Si∣brandus, Junius, Trelcatius;</HI> The Fathers, <HI>Cyprian, Jerom, Augustin, Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Ambrose, Theodoret, Theophylact,</HI> require all things to be done <HI>Consentiente Plebe,</HI> with the <HI>Peoples Consent.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Pastor</HI> ordering the Offender to attend at the <HI>Time appointed,</HI> he then gives him an Oppor∣tunity to express his <HI>Repentance:</HI> Which if the <HI>Pastor</HI> perceives not now done unto Satisfaction, he does with a proper Zeal propose unto the <HI>Brethren,</HI> Whether any one of them can <HI>Object</HI> a∣gainst their proceeding unto the <HI>Censure</HI> of an <HI>Excommunication</HI> upon the <HI>Incorrigible Offender;</HI> — But if they Concur thereunto, he shall take their <HI>Silence</HI> for a full Intimation of their <HI>Consent</HI> unto so sad an Action. Hereupon the <HI>Pastor</HI> (either now goes on unto the Action, or) signi∣fies unto the <HI>Offender,</HI> that he must on such a Day give his Attendence, and hear then what the <HI>Church</HI> has to say unto him. If he refuse to at∣tend on the Day specified, the <HI>Censure</HI> is pro∣nounced upon him, for his adding of such a <HI>Con∣tumacy</HI> unto his former <HI>Iniquity.</HI> But if he do at∣tend, the Pastor having recited a <HI>summary Account</HI> of the Case, in the hearing of the Congregation, once more gives the Offender a Liberty to speak
<PB N="151" REF="002775_0166_0FE6313D87A11C18"/>what he can, for the Prevention of that <HI>Sentence,</HI> which is else waiting for him. If what he says be not a sufficient <HI>Arrest</HI> of the <HI>Judgment,</HI> then, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> elegantly describes this awful Acti∣on, <HI>Judicatur magno cum pondere, ut apud certos de Dei Conspectu, summumque futuri Judicii Praejudici∣um est.</HI> The <HI>Pastor</HI> once again, takes the Con∣currence of the <HI>Brethren,</HI> as he did before; and then proceeds with all possible Seriousness, Gra∣vity, Majesty, Compassion, and Solemnity, unto the <HI>Censure.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Primitive Times,</HI> we find that he who pas∣sed the <HI>formal Sentence</HI> on the Criminal, first begun with <HI>Exhortations;</HI> that is to say, He <HI>exhorted</HI> the Faithful with all Diligent Fear and Care, to avoid the Sins which had brought the Offender before them, into such a deplorable Condition. Then followed sharp <HI>Reprehensions</HI> to the <HI>Offender</HI> himself, rebuking him for his foul Enormities; as being provoking to GOD, provoking to good Men, and pernicious to his own Soul; And in the close of all, the <HI>Divine Censure</HI> was pronounced. Much <HI>such</HI> is the Method of <HI>Excommunication</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>In the Churches formerly, There was little scruple made, of using in <HI>Excommunications,</HI> the Form of, <HI>Delivering up the Offender to Satan, for the Destruction of the Flesh, that the Spirit may be sa∣ved in the Day of the Lord Jesus:</HI> By which they meant, That the Offender, now being declared and censured, as one visibly belonging to the <HI>Kingdom of Satan,</HI> 'twas hoped such a Conviction of his miserable State would hence arise unto his
<PB N="152" REF="002775_0167_0FE63142C1E1C7F0"/>Mind, That his <HI>Corruption</HI> would be thereby mor∣tifyed, and <HI>Salvation</HI> furthered.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Pastors</HI> in some of the Churches, have now espoused another Notion of the <HI>Traditio Satanae</HI> mentioned by the Apostle to the <HI>Corinthi∣aus,</HI> as being a <HI>Prerogative Apostolical</HI> and <HI>Extraor∣dinary.</HI> The Sovereign GOD sometimes gave to His <HI>Prophets</HI> the Power of inflicting <HI>Diseases,</HI> or <HI>Distresses,</HI> on the Bodies of ungodly Men, and of pronouncing upon them those <HI>Bodily Mischiefs,</HI> whereof he has made <HI>Satan</HI> or the <HI>Angel of Death,</HI> to be the Executioner; Of such a Power, <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI> in the <HI>Old</HI> Testament, and <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> in the <HI>New,</HI> have given us Tremendous Ex∣amples. And this Power may seem to have been that <HI>Virga Apostolica</HI> whereof the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. IV. 21. <HI>Shall I come unto you with a Rod?</HI> On which the Author of the Ancient Commen∣tary falsely ascribed unto <HI>Jerom</HI> has this true Gloss, <HI>Quali Virga? Quali</HI> Petrus <HI>venit ad</HI> Ana∣niam <HI>et</HI> Sapphiram, <HI>et</HI> Paulus <HI>ad</HI> Magum; such a <HI>Rod</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> used on <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> and such as <HI>Paul</HI> used on <HI>Elymas</HI> the Sorcerer. And what <HI>Paul</HI> did on <HI>Hymenaeus</HI> and <HI>Philetus</HI> may be a further Instance of it. When the Apostle de∣creed <HI>the Destruction of the Flesh,</HI> unto the Offender whom he <HI>delivered unto Satan,</HI> the Opposition of <HI>the Spirit</HI> in the next Clause makes it evident that <HI>the Body</HI> is intended; He decreed then, that the <HI>Body</HI> of Offender should be left unto <HI>Satanical</HI> Im∣pressions and Afflictions, by the Terrors where∣of his poor <HI>Soul</HI> might be awakened unto a <HI>Saving Repentance. Chrysostom</HI> accordingly, who under∣stood <HI>Greek,</HI> expounds the
ΟΛΕΘΡΟΝ ΣΑΡΚΟΣ as
<PB N="153" REF="002775_0168_0FE63142C5E32808"/>exemplified in the Vexations of <HI>Job;</HI> and adds, <HI>That he may Scourge him with an evil Ulcer, or some other Disease. Ambrose</HI> in like sort expounds it thus; <HI>Nempe sicut Dominus in Animam Sancti</HI> Job <HI>Potestatem non dedit, sed in Carnem ejus permisit Li∣centiam, ita his traditur Satanae. Jerom</HI> thus ex∣pounds it, <HI>Praecepit eum tradi Paenitentiae in Interi∣tum et Vexationem Carnis, per Jejunia et Egrotationes, ut Spiritus Salvus fiat.</HI> Thus <HI>Pacianus</HI> also, in one of his Epistles to <HI>Sempronianus,</HI> by this <HI>Destruction of the Flesh,</HI> understands, <HI>Carnis Angustias, et Detri∣menta Membrorum.</HI> There seems a plain Distincti∣on to be made, [1 Cor. V. 5.13.] The <HI>Censure</HI> upon the Incestuous <HI>Corinthian</HI> is directed by the Apostle in these Words, <HI>Put away from your selves that wicked Person;</HI> The <HI>ordinary Ministry</HI> of the Church was to do this, with the <HI>Consent of the Brethren.</HI> But now the Apostle without staying for their <HI>Consent,</HI> by his <HI>own Authority</HI> says, <HI>I have decreed in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to deliver such an one to Satan.</HI> In which Decree of his, he demands of them to rest Satisfied, when they should be <HI>gathered together.</HI> Hence the Pri∣mitive Churches did abstain from this <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> when they darted the <HI>Thunder∣bolt</HI> with never so many other terrible Circum∣stances. Nothing perhaps would be more terri∣ble, than the <HI>Excommunication,</HI> wherewith <HI>Andro∣nicus,</HI> the Praefect of <HI>Ptolema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> was <HI>Anathematized</HI> by <HI>Synesius,</HI> for his Cruelties and Blasphemies. The Terms were; <HI>Let no Temple of GOD be open unto</HI> Andronicus, <HI>and his Accomplices: Let every Ho∣ly Place be shut upon them. We admonish every Per∣son, whether publick or private, that they neither Lodge
<PB N="154" REF="002775_0169_0FE6314559505CA8"/>with them, nor Eat with them. And especially, let the Ministers of GOD, neither speak to them while they Live, nor be at their Funeral when they Dye.</HI> Of any <HI>Delivering to Satan,</HI> there was ΟΥΔΕ ΓΡΥ. And for this Cause, the renowned <HI>National Synod</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> Protestant Churches met at <HI>Alez,</HI> forbad this <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> to be used among them.</P>
<P>Wherefore the <HI>Pastor,</HI> when he comes to pass the Sentence of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> does make as convincing a <HI>Speech</HI> as he can to the <HI>Offendor,</HI> set∣ting before him the heinous Nature of his <HI>Offence,</HI> and of his <HI>Impenitency</HI> under it. And at the same time, he calls upon all the People to take notice of the <HI>Holiness</HI> which the Church must and will manifest, in their <HI>not bearing with those that are Evil,</HI> and of the transcendent <HI>Holiness</HI> in the Glo∣rious <HI>Head of the Church,</HI> whereof he will have every Church to be sensible. He then concludes with something of this Importance.</P>
<P>—<HI>And now, In the Name of the Glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST, and with the Concurrence of his faithful People now assembled, I do declare you to be CUT OFF, (your Sin hath procured such an Excision for you!) from the Priviledges and Expectations of such as are in Covenant with the Churches of GOD. I declare you to belong visibly to the sinful and woful Kingdom of Satan, the Ruler of the Darkness of this World. I declare you to be a Person, from whom the Followers of our Holy Lord are to withdraw, as from one that walks Disorderly. And this just Sentence is now passed upon you, as a Representation of a Sentence much more dreadful, to be passed upon you, in the Day when the Lord JESUS CHRIST shall come to judge
<PB N="155" REF="002775_0170_0FE631455CFB28B0"/>the World: —Except it be prevented by a seasona∣ble Repentance; which may our Gracious GOD of his Infinite Mercy bestow upon you!</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, Let us pour out our Prayers on this Mourn∣ful Occasion!</HI>— Which the <HI>Fastor</HI> proceeds to do accordingly.</P>
<P>If the Offender have refused his Attendence, the <HI>Excommunication</HI> yet goes on, in Terms proper for one that is <HI>out of hearing,</HI> and <HI>will not hear.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes the Circumstances of the <HI>Offender</HI> are so difficult, that before the Church proceeds to this <HI>Extremity,</HI> they send unto some of the Neighbouring Churches, that from their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legates</HI> meeting in a <HI>Council</HI> for this Purpose, they may receive that <HI>Advice,</HI> which may put their Pro∣ceedings beyond all <HI>Contestation.</HI> And in this the Practice of <HI>New-England,</HI> is not very far different from that of the primitive Times, when it was a Custome, for the Decision of more difficult Points, to desire the <HI>Bishops</HI> of the neighbouring Churches, to come over and assist with their Pre∣sence, to free the <HI>Censures</HI> from the Imputation of <HI>Unrighteousness</HI> or <HI>Partiality.</HI> Thus when a nice Affair was to be determined at <HI>Rome,</HI> on <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s Desire,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Adfuerunt Episcopi Quinque, ut firmato Consilio, quid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Personam eorum observari deberet, consensu ommium Statucre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur;</HI></NOTE> five Bishops assisted, that so what they did might be Indisputable.</P>
<P>§ 3. When a Person has been <HI>Excommunicated,</HI> the Faithful do continue unto him, the general Offices of <HI>Humanity;</HI> nor does he suffer for it any <HI>civil Penalties:</HI> Only this, that such an one is
<PB N="156" REF="002775_0171_0FE6314DCB14FD88"/>rarely chosen by the People to any <HI>publick Em∣ployments.</HI> But yet they withold from him, their <HI>Familiarity;</HI> and act according to the Apostolical Rule of, <HI>Avoiding them;</HI> which in <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s time, was thus understood, <HI>Contumaces et Deum non timen∣tes, et ab Ecclesia in totum recedentes, nemo comitetur.</HI></P>
<P>The Way to get a <HI>Censure</HI> taken off, is by an Exemplary REPENTANCE, and such as may be Satisfactory to the Sentiments of Reasonable Piety.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Repentance,</HI> the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> require not all the Ceremonies mentioned by <HI>Tertullian, A lying in Sackcloth and Ashes, having a squalid Body and a dejected Soul; Fasting, Praying, Weeping, Groaning, and Roaring Night and Day, and throwing themselves at the Feet of the Elders, and kneeling before the Faithful, begging their Prayers and their Pardon;</HI> But yet they require the Essence and Substance of what is mentioned in the Let∣ters of the Ministers to <HI>Cyprian;</HI>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IX. Of COUNCILS upon Emergencies.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. THE Case may be so that a Person may be oppressed by unjust <HI>Passion</HI> and <HI>Prejudice,</HI> and have a <HI>Censure</HI> unjustly passed upon him. In this Case, the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> have a <HI>Remedy</HI> for <HI>Oppression,</HI> that is to say, A COUNCIL; the Methods whereof are now to be declared.</P>
<P>Tho' the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have been called <HI>Independents,</HI> they have not yet arrived un∣to the Degree of <HI>Independency,</HI> which was challen∣ged in the Days of <HI>Austin; Habet omnis Episcopus pro licentiâ Potestatis et Libertatis suae Arbitrium pro∣prium; Judicari ab alio non potest, quomodo nec ipse Judicure; sed expectemus universi Judicium Christi, qui solus habet de actu nostro Judicandi potestatem.</HI></P>
<P>The Person aggrieved applies himself to the <HI>Pastor,</HI> and by him to the <HI>Church,</HI> with humble <HI>Remonstrances</HI> of the Hardships which he appre∣hends used upon him; desiring them to <HI>Review</HI> his Case: And if this don't obtain, then to ac∣commodate him in calling a <HI>Council</HI> of Neigh∣bour Churches, (chosen with mutual Satisfacti∣on,) to judge of the Proceedings.</P>
<P>If <HI>they</HI> refuse to do it, <HI>he</HI> may do it without <HI>them:</HI> Only still informing <HI>them</HI> what he does.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="002775_0174_0FE6314ED8FB37C8"/>
He writes <HI>Letters,</HI> to what Churches in the Neighbourhood he pleases; briefly declaring, That he apprehends himself to suffer by an Ad∣ministration that needs to be more thoroughly enquired into; and entreating the <HI>Pastors,</HI> with the <HI>Delegates</HI> of the Churches to whom he now makes his Address, to come to the <HI>Place,</HI> and at the <HI>Time,</HI> that are specified in the Letters, and consider the <HI>Case,</HI> whereof a full Representation shall then and there be laid before them; and give their <HI>Advice,</HI> which he hopes will be with all Sincerity and Humility hearkened to.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Church</HI> think it adviseable for them to have their Share in chusing and calling the <HI>Coun∣cil,</HI> the Letters then go in <HI>their</HI> Name, (signed by the <HI>Pastor</HI>) and are of the like Importance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pastors</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> (to whom an ag∣grieved Person has (under the neglect of the Church to do any thing for the Relief of his Distress) made his <HI>Complaints,</HI> do not rashly at once read his Letters to their Churches: But having informed themselves as throughly as they can of the Case, they signify unto the <HI>Pastor</HI> of the Church complained of, what they have re∣ceived, and ask <HI>him</HI> to let them know whether the <HI>Difficulty</HI> cannot be removed, without their coming to them as a <HI>Council;</HI> or whether they have any <HI>just Objection</HI> to make against their com∣ing to them. For the management of these <HI>Pre∣liminaries,</HI> the <HI>Pastors</HI> either have an <HI>Interview,</HI> or else by <HI>Messengers</HI> hold such a Communication with one another, as is needful to their Concur∣rence in the Action.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="002775_0175_0FE6315613CAE118"/>
If after all, the <HI>Pastors</HI> are apprehensive that their further Proceeding may be necessary, they proceed then to read their <HI>Letters</HI> to the <HI>Churches;</HI> who thereupon chuse their <HI>Delegates</HI> for a <HI>Council.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Chusing</HI> of the <HI>Delegates,</HI> the <HI>Pastor</HI> usually <HI>Nominates</HI> the Persons whom he would com∣mend unto the Choice of the Church, and then says unto the Church, <HI>If there are any others, whom you will please to nominate on this Occasion, you have and know your Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>When 'tis only an <HI>Aggrieved Party,</HI> that has addressed for a <HI>Council,</HI> the <HI>Pastors</HI> do by the Let∣ters to the <HI>Pastor</HI> of the Church complained of, signify <HI>Where</HI> and <HI>When</HI> their coming is to be looked for.</P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> coming or the Spot, first chuse their <HI>Moderator,</HI> and use <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other necessary <HI>Prae∣liminaries;</HI> Whereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey proceed unto as <HI>publick an Hearing</HI> as they they can have, [name∣ly in the <HI>Meeting-House,</HI>] of the things that are to come under their Examination; The <HI>Modera∣tor</HI> ever beginning with <HI>Solemn Supplications.</HI></P>
<P>Retiring then to the Place of their more <HI>pri∣vate Entertainment,</HI> they there consider over again, all that has been laid before them. Every Mem∣ber of the <HI>Council</HI> may with leave of the <HI>Modera∣tor</HI> declare their Sentiments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Result</HI> is drawn up in a proper <HI>Instrument;</HI> wherein they first <HI>Report</HI> what they <HI>find,</HI> and then <HI>Advise</HI> what they would have to be done; usual∣ly fortifying their <HI>Advice</HI> with pertinent Passages of the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> annexed unto each of the Articles.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="002775_0176_0FE63156177C9E78"/>
If they find, that the Person hath not suffered such <HI>Injury</HI> as he pretends unto, he comes off as unhappily as <HI>Faelicissimus</HI> did; who after he was <HI>Excommunicated</HI> in his own Congregation, made as an <HI>Injured Person,</HI> his <HI>Appeal</HI> to a <HI>Synod;</HI> but <HI>the Synod Ratified and Confirmed the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tence of Ex∣communication against him.</HI></P>
<P>If they find the Person to have suffered <HI>Palpa∣ble Injury,</HI> they endeavour to convince the <HI>Church</HI> of it, and advise them to restore the Injured Per∣son unto his former Station.</P>
<P>They Order that if the Church do refuse this, (or; do refuse to give the <HI>Council</HI> an Account of the Matter; A thing that perhaps <HI>never happened!</HI>) the Person be admitted into some other Church of the Neighbourhood, and so unto Communion with them all.</P>
<P>The Church persisting in their <HI>Irregularity,</HI> they run the hazard of a Proceeding which ne∣ver was (<HI>above once!</HI>) come into; That is, that the <HI>Council</HI> communicating the <HI>true State of the Case</HI> unto the Churches that sent them, and ob∣taining from them a Ratification of their Judg∣ment, they do by a Solemn Act, <HI>Withdraw Com∣munion</HI> from <HI>that Church,</HI> or from as many in it, as will go on to abett and maintain the <HI>Unjust Censure</HI> which has been passed in it. But, <HI>Bles∣sed be the Glorious Head of the Church!</HI> The <HI>Inter∣position</HI> of His Holy SPIRIT working on the Minds of His People, while they are in <HI>His Way</HI> thus waiting on Him, still obtains the Ends which they aim at, and prevents any such dread∣ful Extremities.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="002775_0177_0FE631571BED98E0"/>
'Tis no rare thing for a <HI>Temper</HI> to be found on these Occasions.</P>
<P>Oftentimes an <HI>aggrieved Party</HI> applying to One or Two, wiser Ministers in the Neighbourhood, they do by their private and prudent Methods, bring Matters to such an <HI>Issue,</HI> as to supersede the necessity of a <HI>Council.</HI></P>
<P>It has been thought, an <HI>aggrieved Party</HI> is allow∣ed by the <HI>New-English Platform,</HI> to apply unto <HI>one single Church</HI> in the Vicinity; who by their <HI>Delegates</HI> may, after due Preliminaries, come to the Church complained of, and ask for some Ac∣count of their Proceedings. And if they cannot <HI>put into</HI> Joint, what was <HI>out of it,</HI> this Church which had been applied unto, may then pray a competent Number of <HI>other Churches,</HI> to unite their <HI>Delegates</HI> with them, in a <HI>larger Council,</HI> to use further Endeavours for the Rectifying of what is out of Order. And then! — Something of <HI>this Way</HI> has been sometimes practised.</P>
<P>§. 2. But what shall be done when the <HI>Pastor</HI> himself becomes an <HI>Offendor?</HI> A Deplorable Case this! And yet what sometimes has happen∣ed.</P>
<P>In the Days of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> there were <HI>Martialis</HI> and <HI>Basilides,</HI> two <HI>Spanish Bishops,</HI> deposed by their Churches, for Apostacy and Idolatry; and <HI>Foe∣lix</HI> and <HI>Sabinus</HI> were chosen by their Churches in their Stead. After this <HI>Deposition,</HI> the two Bi∣shops claimed the Exercise of their Authority; But the People denied it unto them: And when the <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> hereupon A. C. 258. con∣vened in a <HI>Synod,</HI> whereof <HI>Cyprian</HI> was the Pre∣sident,
<PB N="163" REF="002775_0178_0FE631571FB6BA88"/>the Action of the Churches was approved and commended, and this <HI>Doctrine</HI> asserted, That they had not acted irregularly since <HI>the People had the chief Power of chusing worthy Bishops, and of re∣fusing those that are Unworthy.</HI></P>
<P>If the Reader will go somewhat higher into <HI>Antiquity,</HI> he may from the <HI>Archives</HI> thereof take down that famous <HI>Epistle</HI> of <HI>Clemens Romanus</HI> to the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church in <HI>Corinth,</HI> which in <HI>Eusebius</HI> is deservedly called, ΜΕΓΑΛΗ ΚΑΙ ΘΑΥΜΑ∣ΣΙΑ, and, ΙΚΑΝΩΤΑΤΗ ΓΡΑΦΗ, A <HI>great,</HI> a <HI>wonder∣ful,</HI> a <HI>powerful</HI> Writing, and one which, he says, was <HI>publickly read in some of the Churches:</HI> And which <HI>Irenaeus</HI> also most justly calls, <HI>Potentissimas Literas.</HI> In all <HI>Antiquity,</HI> after the Writings of their <HI>Apostles</HI> (which indeed make an Honoura∣ble Mention of this our <HI>Clemens,</HI> Phil. IV. 3.) there is not so exact a Representation of the <HI>Or∣der</HI> observed in the <HI>first Christian Churches,</HI> as there is in this <HI>Epistle.</HI> Now this <HI>Epistle</HI> being written to the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> from that at <HI>Rome,</HI> on the Occasion of a <HI>Sinful Excess</HI> which they had committed in the <HI>Deposition of their Elders,</HI> there is not one Word said, as if the <HI>Brethren had assumed a Liberty</HI> to themselves, which they had no claim unto; but they are severely reproved, because they had <HI>Abused</HI> their <HI>Liberty,</HI> in hearkening unto the Suggestions of Two or Three <HI>discontented Persons,</HI> against <HI>Elders</HI> who had <HI>presided Laudably</HI> among them, and who had ne∣ver deserved thus to be dealt withal.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> consider, that as their <HI>Pastors</HI> are not <HI>Ordained</HI> without a <HI>Council,</HI> so neither are they
<PB N="164" REF="002775_0179_0FE6315BFB76AFD0"/>without a <HI>Council</HI> to be <HI>deposed.</HI> Nor do they think, that <HI>ordinarily</HI> a <HI>Church-Meeting</HI> may be regularly held, without the Consent of their <HI>Pas∣tors.</HI> They are not altogether ignorant, that in the <HI>Primitive Times,</HI> where Churches were <HI>associ∣ated,</HI> and their Circumstances would allow of it, they did not by <HI>themselves alone,</HI> exert those <HI>Pow∣ers,</HI> which in Cases of <HI>Necessity,</HI> they might assert as belonging to them. The Churches to prevent the Mischiefs of <HI>Giddiness</HI> and <HI>Faction,</HI> and render all their <HI>Actions unquestionable,</HI> would have their Complaints against <HI>Scandalous Pastors</HI> heard by a <HI>Synod,</HI> without the Concurrence whereof ordina∣rily such Pastors come not under a <HI>Deposition.</HI> Thus we find <HI>Paulus Samosatenus,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Antioch,</HI> was deposed by a <HI>Synod,</HI> held in that Place. And we find <HI>Privatus</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Lambese,</HI> was <HI>No∣naginta Episcoporum Sententia condemnatus.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore when a <HI>Pastor</HI> has fallen into <HI>Scandal,</HI> the Brethren that are acquainted with it, proceed, as they would with another <HI>Brother</HI> in such Cases; only with such <HI>special Terms</HI> of <HI>Respect</HI> (and Repetition of <HI>Address</HI>) as the Rela∣tion of a <HI>Father</HI> may call for.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Scandal</HI> be gone so far that a <HI>publick Sa∣tisfaction</HI> is become necessary, the <HI>Dissatisfied Bre∣thren</HI> apply themselves to him, and request him to appoint a <HI>Church-Meeting,</HI> for the hearing and the healing of the Matter.</P>
<P>If <HI>he</HI> comply, and have his Heart at the <HI>Church-Meeting,</HI> touched with a due Remorse; he offers them his <HI>Acknowledgement;</HI> which if they judge it necessary, they demand that he <HI>Repeat</HI> it, yet more public<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly on a <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> in the Congre∣gation.
<PB N="165" REF="002775_0180_0FE6315C03F19520"/>And he then modestly puts it unto the <HI>Vote,</HI> Whether they have received <HI>Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>But if he be so <HI>self-willed,</HI> that he will not ap∣point a <HI>Church-Meeting,</HI> the <HI>Dissatisfied Brethren,</HI> do set apart some time together to call upon the Glorious GOD for His Direction and Compassi∣on, in the <HI>Grievous Case</HI> now come upon them, and privately advise with some of the <HI>Pastors</HI> in the Neighbourhood; Whereupon they write Letters unto some of the Neighbouring Chur∣ches, wherein they signify, that some unhappy <HI>Offences</HI> have arisen among them, for the manag∣ing and composing whereof, the help of a <HI>Coun∣cil</HI> appears to be necessary; for which Cause they humbly pray, that the Churches would ex∣press their Love and Care for them and send their <HI>Pastors</HI> and other <HI>Delegates</HI> (at the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> intimated) effectually to advise them what may be their Duty on so sad an Occasion.</P>
<P>Or, if at the <HI>Church-Meeting,</HI> he and they can∣not agree; nay, tho' he should hook in the <HI>Major part</HI> unto a <HI>Palliation</HI> of the Matters, and there be no more than two or Three that re∣main still aggrieved; the <HI>Dissatisfied Brethren</HI> make a Tender to join with him in calling of a <HI>Council:</HI> which if he refuse, then these do it without him: Only they still give Notice unto <HI>him</HI> (and his <HI>Party</HI> if he have any,) what they do.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Council</HI> arrives, they first more pri∣vately form themselves into <HI>Order,</HI> by chusing a <HI>Moderator,</HI> and speaking with all Persons concern∣ed so far as they count it needful, by way of <HI>Preparation</HI> for their Business. Then they pass
<PB N="166" REF="002775_0181_0FE6315E8DDDF510"/>to the <HI>Meeting-House;</HI> where being first conve∣niently <HI>seated,</HI> all Persons that will may see and hear all that is done. Prayers are made; the <HI>Offendor</HI> is called for; the <HI>Dissatisfied Brethren</HI> pro∣duce their <HI>Grievances,</HI> with their <HI>Evidences;</HI> and all that can be said on both sides is considered.</P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> then <HI>retire</HI> to their more private Consultation; where they draw up their <HI>final Judgment;</HI> Returning anon to the <HI>publick Assem∣bly,</HI> for the Publication of it.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Offendor</HI> do now come unto them with sufficient Expressions of <HI>Repentance,</HI> they direct a Satisfactory <HI>Repetition</HI> thereof <HI>Now</HI> in the public Assembly, (and if need be, on some following <HI>Lord's Day</HI> also;) and they advise the <HI>Dissatisfied Brethren</HI> to restore their just Regards unto him.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Offendor</HI> be <HI>obstinate,</HI> they then <HI>sharply re∣buke</HI> him; and in a <HI>Written Instrument,</HI> signed by the <HI>Moderator,</HI> and <HI>all the Council,</HI> (or by him, <HI>In the Name of the Council</HI> —) they pronounce him <HI>Unworthy of the Sacred Ministry,</HI> and advise the Church (after due Waiting) to <HI>supply</HI> his Place with a more worthy Person; and also to pro∣ceed unto an <HI>Excommunication,</HI> if he continue in his Impenitency.</P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> returning to the public Assembly, there, after seasonable Speeches made by the <HI>Moderator,</HI> (and others of the <HI>Council,</HI> if they please) the <HI>Result</HI> of the <HI>Council</HI> is read, and then delivered unto one of the <HI>Brethren,</HI> at whose In∣vitation they are here together. And pertinent <HI>Prayers</HI> are added for the Close of all.</P>
<P>If aster all, the Church must come unto that Extremity of an <HI>Excommunication</HI> upon this <HI>Of∣fendor,</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="002775_0182_0FE6315E919A1698"/>they chuse a Grave Pastor of <HI>Another Church,</HI> (unless they have one of <HI>their own</HI>) to come on some <HI>Lord's Day</HI> among them, and go through with it, according to the <HI>General Methods</HI> of such a <HI>Censure.</HI></P>
<P>On the Mention of this, it may be added, That <HI>Churches</HI> remaining Vacant after the Death of their <HI>Pastors,</HI> upon <HI>Difficulties</HI> and <HI>Emergencies</HI> arising among themselves, and Affairs which need a greater Wisdom than their own to manage them, they apply themselves unto some <HI>conside∣rable Minister</HI> in their Vicinity: Entreating him to afford his <HI>Presence</HI> at their <HI>Church-Meeting,</HI> and manage their <HI>Votes,</HI> and regulate all their Pro∣ceedings.</P>
<P>§. 3. The <HI>Translation</HI> of a PASTOR, is a Thing more seldom Occurring, and more hard∣ly Obtained, in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> than in many other of the <HI>Reformed Churches.</HI> The <HI>Relation</HI> between a <HI>Pastor,</HI> and his <HI>People,</HI> is what the Christians throughout the Country, appear generally to think not very easy to be dissolved; and the <HI>Removal of a Minister</HI> is ac∣complished here, with more Difficulty than it is in many other Places. More than Once or Twice there have been published some <HI>Determi∣nations,</HI> which express the General Apprehension in the Churches upon the Matter, to this Pur∣pose;
<Q>A <HI>Pastor</HI> settled in the Service of a Peo∣ple, is to be so sensible of his <HI>Designation</HI> by the SPIRIT and Providence of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for that <HI>Service,</HI> and of the <HI>Account</HI> that he must give unto GOD, about his Beha∣viour in it, that his <HI>Removal</HI> must not be rashly
<PB N="168" REF="002775_0183_0FE63165EE8CC750"/>attempted, but with much Consideration, Con∣sultation, Supplication, and sincere Desire to follow the Conduct of Heaven in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>And,</HI> That the <HI>Will</HI> of our LORD about the <HI>Removal</HI> of any <HI>Pastor</HI> from his <HI>People</HI> may be understood, it is requisite, that the Minister do not entirely <HI>Assume to himself</HI> the Judgment of his own Call to Remove; but a great Regard must be had unto the Direction of the Churches in the Neighbourhood. <HI>And;</HI> If much of <HI>Scan∣dal,</HI> will certainly ensue upon the <HI>Removal</HI> of a a <HI>Pastor</HI> from his <HI>People, That</HI> should weigh down against many Circumstances that would rather invite it.</Q> Upon such Views, it has been judg'd requisite; <HI>First,</HI> That the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the Removal be laid before <HI>Authentic Judges,</HI> and by these be pronounced such, that the <HI>Removal</HI> thereupon may be justly and wisely proceeded in. And, Where it can be obtained, a <HI>Council</HI> of Churches ought therefore to be convened; As there was for the <HI>Ordaining.</HI> And, <HI>Then;</HI> That the <HI>Reasons</HI> be found such as are consistent with the <HI>Solemn Vow,</HI> which the Person who takes the Charge of a Church, makes unto our Glorious LORD, for the faithful Discharge of his Ministry; and the <HI>Labour,</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> of one sensible that his Works are known unto the Lord; and the servent <HI>Love</HI> that such an one should bear to his <HI>Flock; hav∣ing them in his Heart for to Live and to Die with them.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes, but <HI>Rarely,</HI> a <HI>Pastor</HI> and a <HI>People</HI> have with <HI>Mutual Agreement</HI> more <HI>privately</HI> parted with one another; — and <HI>no further Words have been made about it!</HI></P>
<PB N="169" REF="002775_0184_0FE63165F2328278"/>
<P>It is very Edifying to see, That whereas many <HI>Congregations</HI> in the World, would count it A <HI>De∣liverance</HI> (And, <HI>It would be so!</HI>) to have their <HI>Ministers</HI> taken from them, the <HI>Ministers</HI> of this Country <HI>have been,</HI> and <HI>still are,</HI> generally so Es∣teemed and Beloved by their People, that if there were any Motion towards the Calling one of them away, there would be a grievous Commo∣tion among the People upon it; — even as if <HI>Robbers of Churches</HI> were assaulting them.</P>
<P>Indeed, if there be but <HI>One Pastor</HI> in a Church, be <HI>He</HI> never so <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>It</HI> never so <HI>Small,</HI> no Body durst scarce whisper a Word of his <HI>Remo∣val</HI> to another, tho' it might carry with it never such an <HI>Enlargement</HI> of his Opportunities to be Serviceable. And some have thought the <HI>public Benefit,</HI> and <HI>common Interest</HI> of the Churches in ge∣neral has not been so well consulted in this <HI>per∣petual Confinement</HI> of Grown and Bright Abilities.</P>
<P>When a Church has been enriched with <HI>Two</HI> Worthy <HI>Pastors,</HI> another Church that has been <HI>as a City set upon an Hill,</HI> and a Seat of great Impor∣tance, has applied unto them, to obtain one of their <HI>Pastors</HI> from them. And their <HI>Desire</HI> has, tho' not without Difficulty, and <HI>Councils</HI> called and acting on the Occasion, been <HI>accomplished.</HI></P>
<P>In this Case, the <HI>Church</HI> whereto the Released <HI>Pastor</HI> is Invited, sends unto the Neighbouring Churches, to Visit them with their <HI>Pastors</HI> and other <HI>Delegates,</HI> for his <HI>Instalment,</HI> as they do for an ordinary <HI>Ordination.</HI> The <HI>Instalment</HI> is carried on, with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Circumstances and Solemnities of an <HI>Ordination;</HI> only that Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, <HI>the Imposition of
<PB N="170" REF="002775_0185_0FE63166F5C6DC68"/>Hands,</HI> is now omitted; But a <HI>Charge</HI> is given by the <HI>Moderator,</HI> for the <HI>faithful Discharge</HI> of his Ministry in <HI>This Place;</HI> and suitable <HI>Prayers</HI> ac∣company it; Unto which is added, <HI>The Right Hand of Fellowship,</HI> from the Churches.</P>
<P>When the Government of the <HI>Colleges</HI> hath been Vacant, <HI>Pastors</HI> of <HI>Churches</HI> have been chosen to it. But upon the Churches refusing to dis∣miss them, all Parties have been so tender of the Claim which the Churches have to the <HI>Gifts</HI> which their SAVIOUR has bestowed upon them, that the Prosecution of the Matter has been desisted from.</P>
<P>And <HI>yet,</HI> When the <HI>Necessity</HI> has been Great, and all due <HI>Preliminaries</HI> of Councils have been observed, and all due <HI>Reparations</HI> unto the Flock have been offered, and the <HI>Pastor</HI> has been Wil∣ling to answer the Call, but the People have still denied his Dismission; it has been in such a Case declared,
<Q>If a Church addressed for the Grant of their <HI>Pastor</HI> for such a <HI>General Good,</HI> after all due Means, do out of a Principle which does not honour the Gospel, refuse to do <HI>their</HI> plain <HI>Duty,</HI> the <HI>Pastor</HI> who knows <HI>His,</HI> may <HI>do it;</HI> and with much Peace of Mind, Obey the Call of GOD which he has received; and the Chur∣ches throughout the Land will Own him, and Thank him, and Pray for the Blessing of GOD upon him.</Q></P>
<P>§. 4. The <HI>Councils</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> rarely meet with <HI>Contradictions</HI> from the Churches, whose Cases have been laid before them. One Method of Prudence used for the
<PB N="171" REF="002775_0186_0FE5F4B027BCA350"/>Prevention of such Things has been this; That the <HI>Councils</HI> having exhibited their <HI>Decisions,</HI> do not presently <HI>Dissolve,</HI> but <HI>Adjourn</HI> themselves for some Time [certain or uncertain] to see, Whe∣ther their <HI>Advice</HI> be attended or no. The <HI>New English Councils</HI> have been generally so regularly composed, and in so good a Temper, that there has been in them very little Occasion for the old Complaint, <HI>Omne Concilium parit Bellum;</HI> or for such a Story as that of <HI>Curcellaeus, Experientiam docere nullas unquam Controversias de Religione inter Christiancs exortas, Auctoritate Synodali foeliciter ter∣minatas fuisse.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless, there have been formerly some Cases wherein it has been sound necessary to call <HI>New Councils,</HI> for further Deliberations upon Things, which the <HI>First</HI> had not sufficiently and successfully determined.</P>
<P>There are many <HI>Circumstantials</HI> in <HI>Church-Order,</HI> wherein the Churches do leave one another so <HI>Free,</HI> that the <HI>Councils</HI> never find it worth the while to infringe that <HI>Freedom;</HI> and they see no Inconvenience in that <HI>Indulgence,</HI> which the old <HI>Affricon</HI> Synod in their Letter to the more im∣posing <HI>Stephen</HI> pleaded for;
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scimus quosdam, quod semel imbiberint, nolle depo∣nere, nec Propositum suum facile mutant: Sed salvo inter Collegas Pacis et Concordiae Vincul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, quaedam propris, quae apud se semel sunt usurpata, retinere; Qua in re, nec nos Vim cuiquam sacimus, aut Legem damus; cum habear in Ecclesiae Administratione Voluntatis suae Arbi∣trium Liberum, unusquisqve Praep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>situs, Rationem Actus sai Domino redditurus.</NOTE> That <HI>Pastors</HI> may without Offence to their Neighbours, or any

<P>Nevertheless, it is <HI>Believed,</HI> and sometimes has been <HI>practised,</HI> That when any one <HI>Particular Church,</HI> commits a <HI>notorious Error</HI> in its Proceed∣ings, the <HI>Churches</HI> in the Neighbourhood, upon the <HI>Noise</HI> and <HI>Proof</HI> of it may write <HI>Letters of Admoni∣tion</HI> unto the <HI>Erring Church;</HI> not unlike those of old written from the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> unto the Church of <HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' it has never yet been among the <HI>Practises,</HI> yet it is one of the <HI>Principles</HI> in these Churches, That the <HI>Neighbouring Churches,</HI> upon the Motion of their <HI>Pastors,</HI> may without any Call from the <HI>Church,</HI> (or from any in the <HI>Church</HI>) where <HI>gross Mischiefs</HI> do notoriously happen, upon the justly believed Report of those Mischiefs, meet in a <HI>Council</HI> to take a Course about them.</P>
<P>They never had yet any <HI>General</HI> SYNODS <HI>of all the</HI> Churches in a <HI>Colony,</HI> but such as were convened upon a Motion from the <HI>Civil Ma∣gistrate,</HI> upon Matters wherein <HI>all the Churches</HI> were concerned; and this has been <HI>four Times</HI> done in the <HI>Massachusett-Colony.</HI> Nevertheless, they suppose a <HI>Liberty</HI> to meet in <HI>Synods,</HI> with∣out the Direction of the <HI>Civil Magistrate.</HI> Why not, <HI>they say,</HI> as well as the <HI>Primitive Churches</HI> be∣fore the Days of <HI>Constantine?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Synods</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> know no <HI>Weapons,</HI> but what are purely <HI>Spiritual.</HI> They pretend un∣to no <HI>Juridical Power;</HI> nor any significancy, but what is meerly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive</HI> and <HI>Suasory.</HI> They are nothing but some Wise and Good Men meeting
<PB N="173" REF="002775_0188_0FE6316D9ED2AFA0"/>together to advise the Churches how to observe the Rules of the most Inoffensive <HI>Piety.</HI> When they have done all, the Churches are at Liberty, to judge how far their Advice is to be followed. They have no <HI>Secular Arm</HI> to enforce any <HI>Canons;</HI> They ask none; They want none. And they cannot believe, that any Protestant <HI>Secular Arm</HI> would upon a due Information any more Forbid their Meeting, than they would any of the <HI>Reli∣gious Assemblies</HI> upheld in the Country. No body forbids the <HI>General Synods</HI> [or, Conventions] of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> [or the o∣ther <HI>American</HI> Provinces.] Nay, The <HI>Quakers</HI> themselves hold their <HI>General Meetings</HI> without any Commands of <HI>Governours</HI> for the Dispersing of them.</P>
<P>The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> cannot easily have their Sense better express'd, than in the Terms, of the famous <HI>Festus Hommius,</HI> who tho' he pleads for the <HI>Political Binding Power of Synodi∣cal Decrees,</HI> as far as a <HI>Protestant</HI> can do so, yet af∣ter all <HI>shows himself a MAN,</HI> in these Reasonable Words.

For the Churches have not bound their Consciences to the Judgment of those whom they send to the <HI>Synod;</HI> nor have they given them an <HI>Absolute Power</HI> of Decreeing what they List, in their Names: But their Consciences are always tied only to the <HI>Word of GOD;</HI> whereto if they find the Acts and Decrees of their Mes∣sengers conformed, then at length the Churches ought to establish and approve them.</Q></P>
<P>To forbid the <HI>Synods</HI> of Churches, which ne∣ver pretended unto any more than This!—Or, to declare, that the Meeting of such <HI>Synods,</HI> for no∣thing but the Reviving and Preserving of Real PIETY, won't be for the Safety, of — <HI>GOD knows what!</HI> — Unaccountable! However, Since the Provisions which the <HI>General Synods</HI> of the Churches have already made for them are what they are, it is thought by some, that the Publication of this RATIO DISCIPLINAE, may somewhat Supersede all Occasion for any more <HI>General Synods:</HI> They may do well enough without them.</P>
<P>When a <HI>Council</HI> meets. their first Work is, to chuse a <HI>Moderator;</HI> who, like <HI>Cyprian</HI> the <HI>Modera∣tor</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="002775_0190_0FE6316F5FA1E298"/>of the Council at <HI>Carthage;</HI> like <HI>Palmas</HI> the Prolocutor of the Synod in <HI>France;</HI> counts it his Duty from his <HI>Chair,</HI> to see all things calmly <HI>debated,</HI> and fairly <HI>concluded,</HI> and <HI>sum up</HI> all things, that have been deliberated, and call for the <HI>Votes</HI> of the Assembly, and begin and finish all with <HI>Supplications</HI> to Heaven. And sometimes like <HI>The∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>philus</HI> and <HI>Narcissus,</HI> in a Synod of <HI>Pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stine,</HI> there have been <HI>Two Moderators.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' it has been strongly pleaded, that no <HI>Officers</HI> of the Churches have a Right upon <HI>that Score,</HI> to appear as their <HI>Delegates,</HI> but that the Churches may chuse whom they please, for their <HI>Delegates,</HI> and the <HI>Delegates</HI> have all of them an <HI>equal Power</HI> in the <HI>Synod</HI> for which they are cho∣sen: Yet the Churches do <HI>in Fact</HI> proceed no otherwise, than as if their Pastors were <HI>Ex Officio</HI> the Members of the Councils for which their Churches were sent unto. And in the <HI>Choice</HI> of <HI>Delegates</HI> for <HI>Councils,</HI> (as well as in the <HI>Call</HI> for them) still the Terms run, <HI>For Elders and Messen∣gers.</HI></P>
<P>But then on the other hand, the <HI>Pastors</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> ordinarily go to no proper <HI>Councils,</HI> without some other <HI>Delegates,</HI> chosen from among the <HI>Brethren,</HI> to accompany them. And once, when in a <HI>General Synod</HI> of the Churches, there were some Churches who thought it enough that they sent only their <HI>Pastors</HI> unto it, the <HI>Synod</HI> as∣serted, that it was the Duty of the Churches, to have sent <HI>other Messengers</HI> with them; and Let∣ters were for that Purpose immediately issued out unto <HI>these Churches.</HI> They knew that in the Primitive Times, in <HI>Synods,</HI> there were present
<PB N="176" REF="002775_0191_0FE63177FB559728"/>besides the <HI>Church-Officers,</HI>

<P>§. 5. How often <HI>Provincial Synods</HI> were held in <HI>Firmilian</HI>'s Time, is evident from that Report of his, <HI>Per singulos Annos in unum conveniunt.</HI> The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> can have no such thing reported of them. They have no <HI>Provincial Sy∣nods;</HI> and their <HI>Occasional Synods,</HI> on special Emer∣gencies, and of smaller Dimensions, are but as the <HI>Occasions</HI> happen for them. The Thing a∣mong them that is the nearest thereunto, is a <HI>Ge∣neral Convention</HI> of Ministers, (which perhaps are not above half) belonging to the <HI>Province,</HI> at the Time of the <HI>Anniversary Solemnity,</HI> when the <HI>Ge∣neral Assembly</HI> of the Province meets, on the last <HI>Wednesday</HI> in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> to elect their <HI>Counsellors</HI> for the Year ensuing. <HI>Then</HI> the <HI>Minis∣ters,</HI> chusing a <HI>Moderator,</HI> do propose Matters of public Importance, referring to the Interest of Religion in the Churches; and tho' they assume no <HI>Decisive</HI> Power, yet the Advice which they
<PB N="177" REF="002775_0192_0FE6317803C51A68"/>give to the People of GOD, has proved of great Use unto the Country.</P>
<P>There is now taken up the Custom, for (<HI>Con∣cio ad Clerum,</HI>) a Sermon to be Preached unto the Convention of Ministers, on the Day after the <HI>Election,</HI> by one of their Number, chosen to it by their <HI>Votes,</HI> at their Meeting in the preceed∣ing Year.</P>
<P>At this <HI>Convention,</HI> Every Pastor that meets with singular Difficulties, has Opportunity to bring them under Consideration. But the Ques∣tion most usually now considered, is of this Im∣portance, <HI>What may be further proposed, for the pre∣serving and promoting of true PIETY in the Land?</HI></P>
<P>Excellent Things have been here Concerted and Concluded, for, <HI>The Propagation of Religi∣on;</HI> and <HI>Collections</HI> produced for that Purpose in all the Churches.</P>
<P>And Motions have been hence made unto the <HI>General Assembly</HI> for such <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> as the <HI>Morals</HI> of the People have called for.</P>
<P>[The <HI>Governour</HI> of the Province, and such Counsellors as dwell in the City of <HI>Boston,</HI> together with the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the Town, &amp; the Speaker of their <HI>House;</HI> are invited also to dine with the <HI>Ministers,</HI> at the Table, which the <HI>Deacons</HI> of the united Churches in <HI>Boston</HI> provide for them, the Day after the <HI>Election:</HI> Some small Resemblance of what is called, <HI>The Feast of</HI> Moses <HI>and</HI> Aaron, in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI>]</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Boston,</HI> <DATE>1. d. IV. m. 1704.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>To Serve the Great Intentions of Religion, which is lamentably decaying in the Country: It is proposed,</P>
<P N="1">I. That the <HI>Pastors</HI> of the Churches do <HI>per∣sonally Discourse</HI> with the <HI>Young People</HI> in their Flocks, and with all possible Prudence and Goodness endeavour to win their Consent unto the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> in all the Glorious Arti∣cles of it.</P>
<P N="2">II. That unto this Purpose, the <HI>Pastors</HI> do take up that Laborious, but engaging Practice, of making their <HI>Personal Visits</HI> unto all the Fa∣milies that belong unto their Congregations.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the <HI>Pastors</HI> in this Way of Proceed∣ing, bring on their People as far as they can, publickly, and solemnly to Recognize the <HI>Co∣venant</HI> of GOD, and come into such a Degree of the <HI>Church-State,</HI> as they shall be willing to take their Station in: But not to leave off, till they shall be qualified for, and perswaded to, Communion with the Church in <HI>all</HI> special Or∣dinances.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That for such as have submitted unto the <HI>Government</HI> of CHRIST in any of His Churches, no <HI>Pastors</HI> of any other Churches, any way go to shelter them under their Wing, from the <HI>Discipline</HI> of those, from whom they have not been fairly recommended.</P>
<P>V. That they who have not actually Recog∣nized their Subjection to the <HI>Discipline</HI> of CHRIST it. His Church, yet should, either
<PB N="179" REF="002775_0194_0FE63179C756C0F0"/>upon their <HI>obstinate Refusal</HI> of such a Subjection, or their falling into other <HI>Scandals,</HI> be faithful∣ly treated with proper <HI>Admonitions:</HI> About the Method and Manner of managing which <HI>Ad∣monitions,</HI> the <HI>Pastors</HI> with their several Chur∣ches, will be left unto the Exercise of their own Discretion.</P>
<P>VI. It is desired and intended, if the Lord please, That at the <HI>General Convention</HI> of the Ministers, there may be given in by each of the <HI>Pastors</HI> present, An Account of their <HI>Pro∣gress</HI> and <HI>Success</HI> in that holy Undertaking, which has been proposed: That so, the Lord may have the <HI>Glory of His Grace,</HI> and the <HI>Con∣dition of Religion</HI> may be the better known and and served among us.</P>
<P>VII. As a Subserviency to those Good and Great Intentions, it is proposed, That the <HI>Asso∣ciations</HI> of the Ministers in the several Parts of Country may be strengthened; And the seve∣ral <HI>Associations</HI> may be <HI>Letters</HI> hold more free Communications with one another.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>§. 6. It has been proposed, That the Ministers of the Country should form themselves into ASSOCIATIONS that may meet at proper Times to consider such things as may properly ly before them; relating to their own Faithful∣ness towards each other, and the common Inte∣rests of the Churches; And that each of the ASSOCIATIONS have a <HI>Moderator</HI> for a certain time, who shall continue till another be chosen; and who may call them together upon Emer∣gencies.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="002775_0195_0FE6318180D7D5E8"/>
In these ASSOCIATIONS, it has been pro∣posed, <HI>That,</HI> with due Supplications to Heaven, <HI>Questions</HI> and <HI>Cases</HI> of Importanee, either provid∣ed by <HI>themselves,</HI> or by <HI>others</HI> presented unto them, should be upon due Deliberation answer∣ed.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> Advice be taken by the <HI>Associated Pastors</HI> from time to time, e'r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they proceed unto any <HI>Actions</HI> in their Particular Churches which may be likely to produce any <HI>Embroilments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That</HI> the <HI>Associated Pastors</HI> do carefully and lo∣vingly treat each other with that <HI>Watchfulness,</HI> which may be of universal Advantage; And if any Minister be accused unto the <HI>Association</HI> whereto he belongs, of any thing Scandalous, the Matter shall be there examined; And if the <HI>As∣sociated Pastors</HI> find just Occasion for it, they shall direct the calling of a <HI>Council,</HI> who are to proceed against the Offendor.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> these <HI>Associated Pastors</HI> be together ad∣dressed unto and advised withal, when bereaved Churches in their Vicinity need their Direction, for a present Supply of a Vacancy, and to have Recommended unto them such <HI>Candidates</HI> as the Churches may in due time come to make their <HI>Election</HI> from.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> the several <HI>Associations</HI> maintain a due <HI>Correspondence</HI> with one another, that so the <HI>State of Religion</HI> may be the better known and served in the Churches; Yea, if it can be accomplish∣ed, that they may by their <HI>Delegates</HI> meet all to∣gether once in a Year, to concert Matters of a <HI>common Concern</HI> to all the Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="002775_0196_0FE63181846F9AD8"/>
And finally, <HI>That</HI> the Ministers disposed thus to <HI>Associate,</HI> endeavour in the most Efficacious Manner they can, to prevail with such Ministers as unreasonably neglect such Meetings with their Brethren in proper <HI>Associations;</HI> that they would not expose themselves to the Inconveniencies that such Neglects cannot but be attended with∣al.</P>
<P>These <HI>Proposals</HI> have not yet been in all regards <HI>universally</HI> complied withal. Nevertheless, the Country is full of <HI>Associations,</HI> formed by the <HI>Pas∣tors</HI> in their several Vicinities, for the Prosecution of <HI>Evangelical Purposes.</HI></P>
<P>Various are the Methods used in the several <HI>Associations</HI> (according to their own Discretion,) for the modelling of their <HI>Exercises,</HI> and the pur∣suing of their <HI>Intentions.</HI></P>
<P>They sometimes keep <HI>Days of Prayer</HI> together, and procure such <HI>Days</HI> to be kept by the Flocks under their Charge.</P>
<P>They consider CASES that are laid before them; and sometimes their <HI>Answers</HI> to Impor∣tant <HI>Cases</HI> have been published unto the World.</P>
<P>At the Time of their Meeting when it is not very frequent, (which it cannot well be when Towns are far distant from one another) some∣times the People of the Town where they meet, are entertained with a <HI>Lecture</HI> from them.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, <HI>It a confabulantur ut qui fciant Dominum audire.</HI> And the Good Things done by them <HI>cannot be numbred.</HI></P>
<P>§. 7. In a Treatise entituled, <HI>The first Principles of</HI> New-England, there is published an Instru∣ment
<PB N="182" REF="002775_0197_0FE6318288F51B28"/>of the famous Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> pressing,
<Q>That the <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Churches, would meet together in convenient Numbers, at <HI>Set Times,</HI> (which may be left unto the Wisdom of each Society of Churches,) and thus to enjoy and practise <HI>Church-Communion.</HI></Q> And there are added many Directions elaborated by him for the most edifying Management of such <HI>stated Councils.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>John Owen</HI> also in his Treatise of a <HI>Gospel Church,</HI> commends a <HI>constant Actual Communion</HI> of the Churches within the Limits of the same Su∣pream Civil Government, in <HI>Councils.</HI> And he adds,
<Q>I cannot see how it can be any Abridg∣ment of the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>particular Churches,</HI> or in∣terfere with any other of their Rights, which they hold by Divine Institution, if through more <HI>constant Lesser Synods</HI> for Advice, there be a Communication of their mutual Concerns, unto those that are <HI>Greater,</HI> until if Occasion require, and it be expedient, there be a <HI>General Assembly</HI> of them all, to advise about any thing wherein they are, <HI>all concerned.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Under the Influence of such Thoughts, it be∣gan to be <HI>proposed,</HI> That the <HI>Associated Pastors</HI> of every Vicinity, with a proper Number of <HI>other Delegates</HI> (chosen once a Year at least) from their several Churches, might be formed into <HI>stated Councils;</HI> to consult and advise upon such Affairs as might be proper Matter for the Con∣sideration of an <HI>Ecclesiastical Council.</HI></P>
<P>The Opinion of Mr. <HI>John Norton</HI> being much received, That SYNODS are so necessary, <HI>ut Ec∣clesia salutari hoc Remedio non posset carere, sine insig∣ni
<PB N="183" REF="002775_0198_0FE631828C9A93E8"/>Veritatis, Pietatis, et Concordiae Detrimento;</HI> It was esteemed a Dictate of common Sense, that it would be for the Interest of <HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Piety,</HI> to have the <HI>Remedy</HI> always in <HI>Readiness;</HI> and put the Churches into such <HI>Order</HI> that they may go most regularly and reasonably to work, in the Application thereof.</P>
<P>It was also considered, That when <HI>Councils</HI> are called by <HI>Litigant Parties</HI> in Churches, upon E∣mergencies, it had been hitherto in the <HI>Liberty</HI> of each <HI>Party,</HI> to Chuse and Call their own <HI>Council,</HI> where they pleased; which left Room for much <HI>Partiality</HI> to operate, and <HI>One Council</HI> to succeed and oppose <HI>another,</HI> with an <HI>Endless Confusion,</HI> more proper for a <HI>Babel,</HI> than a <HI>City of GOD.</HI> Thro' the Gracious and Watchful Providence of GOD their SAVIOUR, the Churches had not <HI>in Fact</HI> seen much of this <HI>Confusion;</HI> and it may be the <HI>Prudent</HI> Servants of GOD had it more <HI>in Fear</HI> than there was a Real need of. Neverthe∣less, 'twas thought that <HI>Prudence</HI> called for a more effectual Provision.</P>
<P>Accordingly, <HI>Stated Councils</HI> being proposed, the Meeting whereof <HI>once in a Year</HI> was judged little enough; it was now also further proposed, That the <HI>Association</HI> whereto the <HI>Pastors</HI> of such a <HI>Council</HI> belonged, may direct when there should be judged an Occasion for this <HI>Council,</HI> (or <HI>what Part</HI> of it they should think enough) to convene upon an Emergency. And, that the <HI>Determina∣tions</HI> of the <HI>Councils</HI> thus provided for the Neces∣sities of the Churches, were to be looked upon as <HI>Decisive;</HI> except aggrieved Churches or Per∣sons have Weighty Reasons to the <HI>contrary.</HI> But,
<PB N="184" REF="002775_0199_0FE631EDF09B2938"/>that in <HI>such Cases</HI> there should be a <HI>further Hear∣ing;</HI> And that the <HI>Council</HI> for that <HI>further Hearing</HI> should consist of <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> more for Number than the former; and such as might be directed and convened by the Ministers of any <HI>Association,</HI> that should be near to <HI>that,</HI> whereto those of the <HI>former Council</HI> belonged; unto which the <HI>Aggrieved</HI> were accordingly to apply themselves, and in this Way to expect a <HI>final Issue.</HI></P>
<P>Such <HI>Proposals</HI> as these found in one of the <HI>New-English</HI> Colonies a more general Reception (and even a Countenance from the Civil Go∣vernment) than in the Rest. In the other, there were some very considerable Persons among the <HI>Ministers,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Brethren,</HI> who thought the <HI>Liberties</HI> of <HI>particular Churches</HI> to be in danger of being too much <HI>limited</HI> and <HI>infring∣ed</HI> in them. And in a Deference to these Good Men, the <HI>Proposals</HI> were never prosecuted, be∣yond the Bounds of <HI>meer Proposals.</HI> Accordingly the Churches go on in the <HI>Methods</HI> of which an Account was given, before the Introducing of these <HI>Proposals.</HI> And <HI>Humane Prudence</HI> being ob∣liged thus to keep the Stops where it is, the SPIRIT of our SAVIOUR, so descends with His Operations, that <HI>Councils</HI> rarely miss of their de∣sired Efficacy.</P>
<P>There was indeed a Satyr, Printed against these <HI>written Proposals,</HI> and against the Servants of GOD that made them. Nevertheless, those <HI>Followers of the Lamb,</HI> remembring the Maxim of, <HI>Not Answering,</HI> used the Conduct which the University of <HI>Helmstadt</HI> lately prescribed un∣der
<PB N="185" REF="002775_0200_0FE63189CFB1FD78"/>some Abuses put upon them; <HI>Visum est non alio Remedio quam generoso Silentio et pio Contemptu, utendum nobis esse.</HI></P>
<P>§. 7. An Account of the more <HI>General Customs</HI> used in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> has been thus Exhibited. But it must be said, they have also such <HI>Varieties</HI> of lesser Circumstances, that one may with Pleasure say, what <HI>Socrates</HI> reports about the <HI>Various Rites</HI> in the Primitive Churches; <HI>To reckon them all up, would be Difficult, yea, Impos∣sible.</HI></P>
<P>It is possible, that in some Churches, the Tran∣factions may be managed <HI>less</HI> Beautifully than we have described; and in others when the Beauty of the Proceeding may be more equal, yet they may a <HI>little vary</HI> from our Description. However we have kept <HI>very near the Matter,</HI> and with all possible Veracity.</P>
<P>And indeed notable is the Demonstration, which their <HI>happy Experience</HI> gives them, of the <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Madness,</HI> in those <HI>Ecclesiastical Politicians,</HI> who will with a <HI>Phaetontic Fury</HI> set the World on Fire, to impose and inforce their admired <HI>U∣niformity,</HI> in little <HI>Ceremonies</HI> which the <HI>Worst Peo∣ple</HI> can conform to, as well as the <HI>Best</HI> in the World. Their <HI>Experience</HI> proves what <HI>Gregory</HI> long since confessed, <HI>In una Fide nihil officit Sanctae Ecclesiae diversa Consuetudo;</HI> and what <HI>Irenaeus</HI> long before him observed; <HI>A Diversity</HI> [ΔΙΑΦΟΝΙΑ] <HI>in lesser Matters, commends a Church preserving</HI> [ΟΜΟ∣ΝΟΙΑΝ] <HI>the Unity of the Faith.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE X. Special CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. BEsides the more <HI>General</HI> CUSTOMS <HI>of</HI> the Churches, there are a few more <HI>Special</HI> CUSTOMS <HI>in</HI> the Churches, whereof a Brief Recitation may be expected.</P>
<P>We will begin with the DAYS observed a∣mong them.</P>
<P>He that shall read the judicious Discourse of <HI>Soerates</HI> (written above Twelve Hundred Years ago) in the <HI>Twenty First</HI> Chapter of his <HI>Fifth</HI> Book, about HOLY DAYS, will see very much of what is believed in the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land;</HI> Namely (and briefly,) <HI>That the Apostles have set the Churches free from the Yoke of Bondage thereunto.</HI> They are far from reviling that excel∣lent Person as an <HI>Heretic</HI> (which <HI>Bellarmine</HI> did) for Complaining there, <HI>That they who contended for Holy Days, despised the Commandments of GOD.</HI> But they are content themselves to be <HI>Hereticated,</HI> by the popishly affected, for holding, as the <HI>Waldenses</HI> did, more than Five Hundred Years a∣go, <HI>That Constrained and Prefixed Fasts, bound to Days, and all the Rabblement of Rites and Ceremonies, brought in by Man, ought to be abolished.</HI> It was <HI>Luther</HI>'s Desire near Two Hundred Years ago,
<PB N="187" REF="002775_0202_0FE6318F871CE858"/><HI>That there were no other Festival Days amongst Christians, but only the LORD's DAY.</HI> And it was <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Desire at the same Time, <HI>That inasmuch as Christ our Judge, has released us from stated Festi∣val Days, we may not obey any Morsal, that shall go to oblige us thereunto.</HI> According to this <HI>Desire</HI> is the <HI>Practice</HI> of these <HI>American</HI> Churches. And if King <HI>James</HI> once could boast of the Purity in the Church of <HI>Scotland, That not so much as</HI> Easter <HI>or</HI> Christmas <HI>was observed in it;</HI> Even such a Boast may be humbly made about the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> Nor do these Churches hither∣to discover any <HI>Tendencies</HI> towards a Compliance with that which was one of the earliest <HI>Aposta∣cies</HI> and <HI>Superstitions</HI> in the Primitive Times, (and as Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> calls it, <HI>The first Weapon wherewith the Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>play'd his Prizes against other Churches</HI>) that is, an <HI>imposed</HI> HOLY DAY. But they rather Censure it as a very unadvised Speech in Dr. <HI>Hammond; That when the Festivals are turn∣ed out of the Church, it will not be in the Power of Weekly Sermons, on the Heads of Religion, to keep up the Knowledge of CHRIST in Men's Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>The Churches make a Difference between <HI>Taking a Time</HI> to <HI>Do</HI> a <HI>Sacred Work;</HI> and the <HI>Do∣ing</HI> a <HI>Work</HI> to <HI>keep</HI> a <HI>Sacred Time.</HI> To esteem any <HI>Good Work</HI> the <HI>better</HI> for its being done on such or such a Return of a <HI>Time,</HI> which GOD has not in His Word set apart for it, is to make the <HI>Time</HI> itself a <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>Worship;</HI> and they judge it an unwarrantable thing, for Men so to <HI>impose</HI> upon Heaven, with their own <HI>Inventions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="002775_0203_0FE6318F8ABE4268"/>
The Churches look upon Solemn HUMILI∣ATIONS and THANKSGIVINGS, as <HI>Moral Duties,</HI> to be observed <HI>Pro Causis et Temporibus:</HI> And therefore they regard the <HI>Directions of Divine Providence,</HI> in laying before them the <HI>fresh Occasi∣ens</HI> thereof; which could not so well be done, if they were made <HI>perpetual.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the Year the GOVER∣NOUR with the Advice of the <HI>Council,</HI> (&amp; some∣times also at the Motion of the Representatives) publishes a <HI>Proclamation</HI> directing such a Day, as he with <HI>them</HI> thinks fit, for Solemn <HI>Humiliations,</HI> with <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fasting,</HI> to obtain a <HI>Blessing</HI> on the Affairs of the Year ensuing.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Conclusion,</HI> the GOVERNOUR, upon the Advice and Motion aforesaid, publishes a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> specifying a Day for Solemn <HI>Thanks∣givings,</HI> on the Account of <HI>Mercies</HI> received in the foregoing Year.</P>
<P>The Ministers read these <HI>Proclamations</HI> in their Congregations, on some LORD's DAY before the Days thus called for; and often with agree∣able <HI>Speeches</HI> prepare their People for the <HI>Duties</HI> of them.</P>
<P>In these <HI>Proclamations</HI> there is inserted a Clause, <HI>Inhibiting all Servile Labour</HI> on the <HI>Days</HI> appoint∣ed; and the <HI>Days</HI> are accordingly observed, with a strict Application to the <HI>Proper Duties</HI> of them; yea, observed as <HI>Extraordinary Sabbaths.</HI> Not on∣ly the Days of <HI>Humiliation</HI> are so, but the Days of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> also: It may be, there are no <HI>Days of Thanksgiving</HI> any where on the Face of the Earth, kept in so <HI>Religious,</HI> and <HI>Sabbatizing</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="002775_0204_0FE631914544EC38"/>a Manner, as they are in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> There are no such Ringing of <HI>Bells,</HI> and making of <HI>Bonfires,</HI> and other <HI>Frolicks,</HI> as there are on such Occasions in some of our <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Churches. And may they be forever pre∣served from such Profanations!</P>
<P>As other <HI>extraordinary Occasions</HI> do occur, at any other time of the Year, the <HI>Civil Authority</HI> takes a like Notice of them.</P>
<P>And it is a very frequent thing, for particular <HI>Pastors</HI> with their <HI>Churches,</HI> to keep <HI>Solemn Days</HI> in their own Congregations, as they see Occasi∣ons for them; without any Direction from the <HI>Civil Authority.</HI> So <HI>Cyprian</HI> in a Time of Calami∣ty; <HI>Ad placandum atque exorandum Dominum,</HI> saith he, <HI>Non Voce sola, sed et Jejuniis et Lacrymis, et om∣ni genere Deprecationis ingemiscamus.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, Sometimes the <HI>Pastors</HI> in a <HI>Vicinity</HI> agree to keep the <HI>Wheel</HI> of their Devotions in a <HI>conti∣nual Motion,</HI> by such <HI>Days</HI> kept <HI>successively</HI> in their several Congregations; wherein they enjoy much <HI>Communion</HI> with and <HI>Assistence</HI> from one a∣nother. Thus <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells, That in the Pri∣mitive Times, the <HI>Bishops</HI> did <HI>ordain Fasts for the Churches,</HI> ex aliqua Solicitudinis Ecclesiasticae Causa, <HI>according as the Troublesome Circumstances of the Church called for it.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes one particular Church, and some∣times a Number of Consociated Churches in a Neighbourhood successively, have set apart whole <HI>Days of Prayer,</HI> on this peculiar Intention; To pray for a <HI>Successful Ministry;</HI> and more particu∣larly, to obtain it, that the <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> would infuse a <HI>Principle of Piety,</HI> into the Hearts of the
<PB N="190" REF="002775_0205_0FE63191499C3480"/><HI>Rising Generation,</HI> and by a mighty Effect of His Gospel upon them, render their Children a <HI>Pious Generation.</HI> A marvellous Efficacy of the Gospel in a <HI>Conversion</HI> of <HI>Young People</HI> unto serious Reli∣gion, and an <HI>Addition</HI> unto the Churches of <HI>them that shall be saved,</HI> have been observed among the <HI>Consequences</HI> of such an Action.</P>
<P>When <HI>Beloved Pastors</HI> have been taken <HI>Sick,</HI> their Churches, Visited and Affisted by the Neigh∣bouring Pastors, have kept their <HI>Days of Prayer</HI> for them: And it has been rarely known, that such <HI>Pastors</HI> have not been remarkably Recover∣ed. Solemn and public <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> have some∣times followed.</P>
<P>Some Churches blessed with excellent <HI>Pastors,</HI> have kept their <HI>Days of Thanksgiving</HI> for their E∣vangelical Enjoyments; [Assisted with Neigh∣bouring Pastors, on these Occasions.] It has been very agreeable, to see with what Ingenuity the Humble and Modest Pastors have behaved themselves, when such <HI>Roses</HI> have been cast upon them. One by whom <HI>Cambridge</HI> was once illu∣minated, on such a Day, Preached on, 2 Cor. XII. 11. <HI>I am Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>When Days of <HI>Humiliation</HI> or of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> have been observed, it has been a frequent thing, for <HI>Collections</HI> of Money for <HI>Pious Uses</HI> to be made in the Assemblies; That so it might be said, <HI>Thy Prayers and thy Alms are come up for a Memorial be∣fore GOD.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Zeal</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Spirit of the Gospel,</HI> operating in the Churches, has disposed them to make several noble Efforts, for the <HI>Propagation of</HI> (not <HI>Party,</HI> but <HI>Pure and Undefiled) Religion,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="002775_0206_0FE631954714BA98"/>and the <HI>Gospellizing</HI> of Plantations which have been the <HI>Unwatered Places of the Wicked One.</HI> Ge∣nerous <HI>Collections</HI> have been made in the <HI>Churches,</HI> to support the Expences of sending <HI>Missionaries</HI> to such Places, and building <HI>Meeting-Houses</HI> in them. And the Gentlemen who <HI>Devise Liberal Things,</HI> have also more privately advanced Sums of Money on such Occasions and Intentions. <HI>Associated Pastors</HI> have been at the Head of these Actions; And the <HI>Success</HI> has not been Contemp∣tible; tho' the Invisible <HI>Rulers of the Darkness of this World,</HI> have sensibly enough done their Part for the Clogging of such Undertakings.</P>
<P>There has been offered unto the Churches, A <HI>Proposal,</HI> for an EVANGELICAL TREASURY, to be Raised by <HI>Collections</HI> on the Days of <HI>Suppli∣cation,</HI> and of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> (which are kept eve∣ry Year) in the <HI>Congregations</HI> of the Country; and lodged in the Hands of <HI>Trustees,</HI> who are to lay it out still with the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI> of the Churches to which it belongs. The <HI>Princi∣pal Intention</HI> of it, <HI>The Propagation of Religion;</HI> es∣pecially when Good is to be done in <HI>Ungospellized Places;</HI> But also, For any <HI>Pious Uses,</HI> which any <HI>particular Church</HI> may see Cause to pursue, within their own Vicinity. The <HI>Proposal,</HI> is in the <HI>United Churches</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI> begun to be Prosecuted and Executed.</P>
<P>§. 2. 'Tis usual among us, for Christians to uphold PRIVATE MEETINGS, wherein they do with various Exercises <HI>Edify one another;</HI> and it is not easy to reckon up the <HI>Varieties</HI> used in them. 'Tis observed, That the <HI>Power of Godliness</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="002775_0207_0FE631954B724858"/>ordinarily prevails in a Place, as the PRIVATE MEETINGS are duly kept up and carried on.</P>
<P>Sometimes a <HI>Dozen Families</HI> more or less, agree to meet in a <HI>Course,</HI> at one anothers Houses, on a <HI>Day,</HI> and at an <HI>Hour,</HI> agreed on, once a <HI>Fortnight</HI> or once a <HI>Month,</HI> as they shall please. And the <HI>Families</HI> unto whose <HI>Turn</HI> it falls to entertain the Rest, sometimes takes that Opportunity, to invite others of their Neighbours unto the Religious Entertainments of their Houses.</P>
<P>They sometimes have the Company of a <HI>Mi∣nister,</HI> who spends an Hour or Two in a <HI>Prayer</HI> and a <HI>Sermon</HI> with them. And the <HI>Candidates</HI> of the Ministry sometimes do at these Meetings perform some of their first <HI>Probationary Exercises.</HI></P>
<P>Otherwise, One of the <HI>Brethren</HI> makes a <HI>Pray∣er;</HI> and one reads a <HI>Sermon,</HI> either Printed in a Book, or taken by the <HI>Pen of a ready Writer</HI> in the public Assemblies: And they close the Ex∣ercise with <HI>Singing</HI> of <HI>Psalms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bucer</HI> indeed affirms, that <HI>Lay Men</HI> were ad∣mitted sometimes to Interpret the Holy Scrip∣tures, in the Primitive Churches; tho' they per∣formed it mostly when the <HI>Rectors</HI> of the Churches were Present. There was a Custom of this Na∣ture in the <HI>Jewish Synagogues;</HI> And <HI>Grotius</HI> tells us, The Custom contiuned for a while in the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> that <HI>unordained Persons</HI> were ad∣mitted sometimes to <HI>Expound the Scriptures</HI> in pub∣lic among them. <HI>Eus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bius</HI> proves by the Exemple of <HI>Origen</HI> &amp; others, <HI>That it was not Unusual for Lay Men to Preach.</HI> And in the <HI>Constitutions,</HI> that go under the Name of <HI>Clemens,</HI> 'tis conceded, <HI>A Laick may be a Teacher.</HI> At the <HI>Private Meetings</HI> in some
<PB N="193" REF="002775_0208_0FE6319A9AA7AF48"/>former Years, the <HI>Private Brethren</HI> would some∣times <HI>Preach themselves.</HI> But that Practice is now generally laid aside, throughout all <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>At some of these <HI>Meetings</HI> the Method has been for a Question of <HI>Practical Divinity</HI> to be propos∣ed unto the Company, for some <HI>certain Persons,</HI> prepared for that Purpose, to give what Answer they please unto it.</P>
<P>The Ministers have o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en found a great Ad∣vantage unto their <HI>Labours,</HI> and unto their <HI>Chur∣ches,</HI> by giving Encouragements unto RELIGI∣OUS SOCIETIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE; which meet especially on the <HI>Lord's Day Even∣ings.</HI> It has been in many Places, the Practise of Pious <HI>Young Men,</HI> to spend an Evening, Two Hours together; when they repeat a <HI>Sermon,</HI> and they take their Turns to <HI>pray,</HI> one before, a∣nother after, the Repetition. <HI>Psalms</HI> are sung. They <HI>promise</HI> to walk orderly; and <HI>subscribe</HI> their Names to the Promise. If any of the <HI>Listed Com∣pany</HI> do any <HI>Scandalous Thing,</HI> they first <HI>Admonish</HI> him, and upon Impenitency they <HI>Blot</HI> him out of the <HI>List.</HI> All that join unto their Number, they carry unto their <HI>Pastor,</HI> for him to <HI>Instruct,</HI> and <HI>Caution,</HI> and <HI>Approve</HI> the Person, before they ad∣mit him. These <HI>Nurseries of Early Piety,</HI> have been attended with Marvellous and Precious Con∣sequences. The <HI>Ministers</HI> have sometimes En∣couraged them with their Visits, &amp; Prayers, and Sermons.</P>
<P><HI>Holy Women</HI> by themselves, both <HI>Elder &amp; Younger,</HI> in smaller Numbers, with all possible Privacy and Modesty, have here and there their <HI>Meetings</HI> for <HI>Social Devotions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="002775_0209_0FE6319A9E58B510"/>
Yea, the very <HI>Negro</HI>'s in a Town, have their <HI>Constant Meetings,</HI> for Exercises of Piety; where∣in they <HI>pray</HI> by their Turns, &amp; read a <HI>Sermon,</HI> and sing a <HI>Psalm,</HI> and hear one another say the <HI>Cate∣chism;</HI> &amp; upon Miscarriages in any of their Com∣pany, Employ severe &amp; proper <HI>Censures.</HI> The <HI>Ministers</HI> do not think much to Visit them once a Quarter, &amp; Pray with them, &amp; Preach to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Private Meetings</HI> of the Faithful do upon Emergencies often spend <HI>whole Days</HI> together, in <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord; and some∣times in <HI>Thanksgivings.</HI> And it is no little Ser∣vice or Comfort unto their Faithful <HI>Pastors</HI> to have such Flocks as will in this Way repair unto Heaven for them in all their Difficulties.</P>
<P>§. 3. Such <HI>Customs</HI> have these <HI>Churches of GOD.</HI> But still there are those <HI>agreeable Varieties</HI> among the Churches in all such <HI>Modalities,</HI> that they find not the least Inconvenience in following <HI>Austin</HI>'s Counsel, who in diverse of his <HI>Epistles</HI> permits, <HI>Any Church to differ from others in Ceremonies, and in manner of Government, provided they agree with them, in the Unity of the Faith.</HI> And it is with them as that great Lawyer <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>frey</HI> reports of the Primi∣tive Churches; <HI>It was not one Discipline, but one Faith, which United them.</HI></P>
<P>The People of GOD, whose <HI>Customs</HI> have this Relation given of them, have not the Vanity to think, that their <HI>Works are perfect before GOD,</HI> or, that in their <HI>Discipline</HI> they <HI>perfectly Answer</HI> the Rules for the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Church State,</HI> left unto us by our A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended SAVIOUR. And yet the <HI>Es∣sentials &amp; Substantials</HI> of the <HI>Discipline</HI> in these Churches, doubtless are so <HI>Defensible</HI> by the <HI>Sacred
<PB N="195" REF="002775_0210_0FE631A0B27A39D8"/>Scripture,</HI> and so conformable to the <HI>Primitive Pat∣tern,</HI> and so evidently subservient unto the Grand Intention of the <HI>Church Staté,</HI> even the PIETY <HI>wherein all Good Men are United,</HI> that they do well to think, that it would be a most foolish &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottish Thing to desert them. If the Churches have their <HI>Deficiencies,</HI> in any Points, that want either to be <HI>Corrected,</HI> or to be <HI>Improved,</HI> it is no more than what is to be Expected, until the <HI>Antichristi∣an Apostacy</HI> be expired. Nor must it be conceal∣ed, that the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> are not without sad <HI>Instances</HI> of some, and some <HI>Tendencies</HI> to more, <HI>Apostacy.</HI> 'Tis possible that some Good Men abroad, would upon the Sight of the Ac∣count that has been given of the <HI>Discipline</HI> obser∣ved in these Churches, be ready to say as <HI>Vergeri∣us</HI> did when he read the <HI>Discipline</HI> observed in the Churches of <HI>Bohemia; I would to GOD, I were among you!</HI> But he must not be called, A <HI>Calum∣niator,</HI> who informs them, That they will not find <HI>New England</HI> a <HI>New Jerusalem.</HI> Tho' the Body of the People are a <HI>Sober, Honest, Industrious,</HI> &amp; well disposed sort of Men; Unexceptionably <HI>Loyal</HI> to the <HI>British</HI> Sceptre; &amp; <HI>Hospitable</HI> to <HI>Strangers</HI> (who yet often treat them with a strange Indignity and Ingratitude, and such as would never be endured without the greatest <HI>Resentments</HI> in any other Country!) and the common People are better ac∣quainted with <HI>Religion,</HI> than in any other Country upon the Face of the Earth; Yea, some <HI>whole Towns</HI> have not so much as <HI>One Family</HI> in them, which does not maintain a <HI>Religions Worship</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR, or so much as <HI>One Person</HI> that is known to <HI>walk disorderly;</HI> Nevertheless
<PB N="196" REF="002775_0211_0FE631A0B6206A30"/>there is found among them, too much Cause to complain of a Gradual and a Growing <HI>Apostacy</HI> from the <HI>Religious Disposition</HI> that signalized the <HI>first Planters</HI> of the <HI>New-English</HI> Colonies. The <HI>Spirit of this World</HI> has too far brought a <HI>Death</HI> up∣on the Spirit &amp; <HI>Power of Godliness;</HI> and a Christi∣an full of lively <HI>Piety, &amp; Charity, &amp; Self-Denial,</HI> and universal <HI>Holiness &amp; Fruitfulness,</HI> is not so frequent a Sight, or at least not in so much <HI>Proportion</HI> to them that have only <HI>a Name to live,</HI> as once it was among them. 'Tis feared by some wise Men, that the Natural Consequence of this <HI>Degeneracy,</HI> will be this, That many of the <HI>Rising Generation</HI> will grow weary of their <HI>Church-State,</HI> (as they say 'tis in <HI>Scotland;</HI>) yea, some of their <HI>Seers</HI> have not been without melancholy Apprehensions, lest <HI>New England</HI> have now done the most that it was intended for; and least our Glorious Lord <HI>Come quickly,</HI> in various Ways, to <HI>remove His Golden Candlesticks</HI> from a Place which has been in a more than ordinary Measure illuminated with them. ΑΠΙΗ Η ΠΕΙΡΗ ΤΟΥ ΛΟΓΟΥ! Let us <HI>hope for better things!</HI> What the famous Rabbi in the <HI>Prike Avoth</HI> said, <HI>A Church set up for GOD, shall be Established;</HI> it may be hoped, will be fulfilled in these Chur∣ches, which were most certainly formed <HI>For GOD, and His CHRIST.</HI> It may be hoped that this <HI>A∣merican Wilderness</HI> will not speedily be a <HI>Desert</HI> for∣saken of Good Men, which <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> tells us, was the Condition of his unhappy Neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P>§. 4. But if the <HI>New English</HI> Churches may have any <HI>Deficiencies,</HI> they will not be Easily or Presently convinced, that <HI>one of them</HI> is their want
<PB N="197" REF="002775_0212_0FE631A1C02E7A70"/>of a <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy.</HI> The <HI>Domination</HI> of <HI>One</HI> Clergyman, as one in a <HI>Superiour Order,</HI> above those who should be the <HI>Pastors</HI> of <HI>particular Con∣gregations,</HI> (but now become his <HI>Curates,</HI>) Exer∣cising an Authority over a Number of such <HI>Cu∣rates,</HI> &amp; their <HI>Congregations,</HI> who are thereby de∣prived of the <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>manage within themselves</HI> the <HI>Discipline</HI> with which the House of GOD is to be regulated; This is an <HI>Invention</HI> which the Chur∣ches of <HI>New-England</HI> will probably continue Strangers to. Since they find a <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> ven∣tures to say,
<Q>I believe on the strictest Enquiry, <HI>Medina</HI>'s Judgment with be found True; That <HI>Jerom, Austin, Ambrose, Sedulius, Primasius, Chry∣sostom, Theodoret,</HI> were all of <HI>Aerius</HI>'s Judgment, as to the <HI>Identity</HI> of both Name &amp; Order, of <HI>Bi∣shops &amp; Presbyters,</HI> in the Primitive Churches:</Q> They think, they have Company which they need not be ashamed of. And they hope, that the <HI>Validity of their Ministry</HI> will not be contested, for the want of what they call, <HI>Episcopal Ordina∣tion.</HI> And that much less the <HI>Profane &amp; Senseless</HI> Whimsey of an <HI>Uninterrupted Line of Succession</HI> will be urged on their Ministry. And that this will be least of all urged by them who pretend a Suc∣cession from <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk, of whom it has been proved that what <HI>Ordination</HI> he had, was null &amp; void by the Canons of all the <HI>First General Councils.</HI> But, We cannot more agreeably express their Sentiments, than in the Words of One who was well acquainted with them.</P>

<PB N="201" REF="002775_0216_0FE631AAA10B9C28"/>in vain to take off this Man from us. Yea, our <HI>Juel</HI> delivers not only his own <HI>private Opi∣nion,</HI> but also the Sense of <HI>The Church of England,</HI> in the <HI>Apology</HI> for it, when he recites the Opi∣nion of <HI>Jerom,</HI> and adds, <HI>This is the Thing that we Defend.</HI> At the same time he quotes <HI>Eras∣mus,</HI> who speaking of <HI>Jerom</HI>'s Time, says, <HI>Id tem∣poris idem erat Episcopus, Sacerdos et Presbyter.</HI> And unto this Testimony of <HI>Jerom,</HI> our <HI>Juel</HI> adds that of <HI>Austin;</HI> That the Office of a <HI>Bishop</HI> is above the Office of a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> not by Authority of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> but after the Names of <HI>Honour</HI> which the <HI>Custom</HI> of the Church has now obtained. It gives a notable Strength to the <HI>Doubts</HI> raised in the Minds of Millions in our Nation, concern∣ing the <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy,</HI> when they find the Church of <HI>England</HI> it self denying a <HI>Divine Right</HI> unto it; &amp; they are certain that the <HI>Divine Right</HI> thereof was never publickly owned, till King <HI>James</HI> came to be King of <HI>England,</HI> who upon the Enchantments of a well known <HI>Prelate,</HI> first yielded unto <HI>That,</HI> which his Predecessors would never have endured. And yet that very Gentleman, with his Brethren, would not <HI>Re∣ordain</HI> the <HI>Scottish Presbyters,</HI> when they were to be made <HI>Prelates:</HI> His Conscience compelling him to give that Reason for it; <HI>For to doubt of the Validity of</HI> Presbyterian Ordination, <HI>was to doubt whether there was any Lawful Vocation in most of the Reformed Churches.</HI> Without going back as far as the more early Days, of King <HI>Elfrick,</HI> when the <HI>Church of England</HI> plainly denied <HI>Bi∣shops &amp; Presbyters</HI> to be <HI>distinct Orders,</HI> they find, that in the Dawn of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> by such
<PB N="202" REF="002775_0217_0FE631AAA4987FF0"/>Witnesses of our Lord as <HI>Tindal, &amp; Lambert,</HI> and <HI>Barnes,</HI> and, how many more of our glorious Martyrs? — this Position was vigorously advan∣ced, That the <HI>Apostles following the Rule of CHRIST</HI> ordained in His Congregation only those <HI>Two</HI> Officers, A <HI>Bishop</HI> which is the same with a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Deacon.</HI> And it prevailed so far, that <HI>Cranmer</HI> himself, the <HI>Primate of all England,</HI> Embraced it. Yea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it was not long before it was owned by public Authority; and in, <HI>The necessa∣ry Erudition of a Christian Man,</HI> a Book then pub∣lished by Authority, as the <HI>Doctrine of the Church of England,</HI> it is in Express Terms affirmed, <HI>That of these Two Orders only</HI> [Presbyters &amp; Deacons] <HI>the Scripture makes Express mention.</HI> The Decla∣ration about the <HI>Institution of Bishops &amp; Priests,</HI> then also subscribed by the Lord <HI>Cromwel,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Archbishops</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> &amp; <HI>York,</HI> &amp; other <HI>Bishops</HI> and Civilians, denied any Superiority of a <HI>Bishop</HI> above a <HI>Presbyter</HI> to be found in the <HI>New-Testa∣ment,</HI> and allowed unto a <HI>Presbyter</HI> the Power of <HI>Ordination &amp; Excommunication.</HI> In the very first Year of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the VIth's Reign, there was an <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> which as <HI>Heylin</HI> complains, forced the <HI>Episcopal Order</HI> from their strong hold of <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> &amp; made them no other than the <HI>Kings Ministers only. Poinet</HI> then writing a∣gainst <HI>Gardiner,</HI> shews, that the <HI>Reformers</HI> in those Days were willing, even to lay aside the Name of <HI>Bishop,</HI> &amp; say <HI>Elder</HI> instead of it. And <HI>Cran∣mer</HI> in his Resolutions to the King's Questions, approved by other <HI>Bishops,</HI> has these Words, <HI>The Bishops &amp; Priests were not two distinct Things, but both one Office in the Beginning of Christ's Religion:</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="002775_0218_0FE631AFD15053C8"/>And he further makes it Manifest, That the Great <HI>Reformers</HI> owned not <HI>Episcopacy</HI> as a <HI>dis∣tinct Order</HI> from <HI>Presbytery,</HI> to be of <HI>Divine Right;</HI> but only as a <HI>prudent Constitution</HI> of the <HI>Magis∣trate,</HI> for the better Governing of the Church. <HI>Beaton</HI> also, a famous Refugee in Q. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time, in his Catechism, dedicated unto both Archbi∣shops, puts the Question, <HI>What difference is there between a Bishop &amp; a Presbyter?</HI> And answers, <HI>None at all; Their Office is the same, their Authority and Power is one.</HI> It is most certain, That upon the Revival of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> at Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s coming to the Crown, the most acknowledged and celebrated Writers of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> still made the very same Concession. Yea, Archbishop <HI>Whitgift,</HI> himself speaking of the Go∣vernment of the Church of <HI>England</HI> by Bishops, in his Time, says, <HI>It is well known, that the Man∣ner &amp; Form of Government, used in the Apostles Time, &amp; expressed in the Scripture, is not now obser∣ved.</HI> There are those to be found, even among the <HI>Prelates</HI> themselves, who have told but a <HI>sad Story,</HI> and yet given a just &amp; fair Account, How and Why the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of <HI>Prelacy</HI> came to be first asserted; which is almost unaccountably become the <HI>Topping Doctrine</HI> of our Days. Be it how it will, certainly Men that are not far gone with the <HI>Spirit of a Party,</HI> will not go beyond the Temper of Dr. <HI>Ward,</HI> who in his <HI>Determinations,</HI> when he speaks of the Difference between the <HI>Few</HI> Churches that have <HI>Prelates,</HI> and the <HI>many more</HI> Churches that have <HI>None,</HI> says, It ought to be tolerated, <HI>Absque Fraternae Unitatis Laesione.</HI> Most certainly they who consider, that even in
<PB N="204" REF="002775_0219_0FE631AFD53A3C10"/>the Popish Times, the <HI>English Parliaments</HI> took upon them to create <HI>new Bishopricks;</HI> and that <HI>Giraldus Cambrensis</HI> assures us, there were no less than <HI>Threescore Bishopricks</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> when the Island was not yet wholly Christianized; would not think that an <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> would Un∣christianize the Island by making above <HI>Nine Thousand Bishopricks,</HI> where there are now no more than <HI>Six &amp; Twenty.</HI> — All the World knows that <HI>all the Churches of the Reformation,</HI> on the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> subsist upon a <HI>Presby∣terian Ordination.</HI> And the <HI>Superintendents</HI> in the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches, make not the Pretensions of our <HI>Prelates.</HI> But when the <HI>Papists</HI> of late Years as well as formerly, have been trying to make <HI>Disturbances</HI> among them, with Clamours like what have been made elsewhere, That they have no <HI>True Ministers,</HI> &amp; so not <HI>Sacraments,</HI> be∣cause they want <HI>Episcopal Ordination,</HI> [As <HI>Osian∣der</HI> the Chancellour of the University of <HI>Tubin∣gen,</HI> particularly complains, in his Treatises of Casuistical Divinity published A. C. 1680. <HI>The Popish Doctors suppose that Presbyters cannot be Or∣dained but by a Bishop, &amp; for this very Reason, they deny the Truth of the Lutheran Ministry:</HI>] their most Learned <HI>Historians &amp; Advocates,</HI> in their Answers, confess that their <HI>Lutheran Ministers</HI> have none but a <HI>Presbyterian Ordination:</HI> But then prove the Cavils of the <HI>Papists</HI> on that Score to be <HI>Unreasonable.</HI> No longer ago than the be∣ginning of the present Century, <HI>Joachim Hilde∣brand,</HI> in his Treatise, concerning <HI>the Hierarchy of the Church,</HI> has this Passage; <Q>The <HI>Great Ques∣tion</HI> between us &amp; the Papists is, Whether in the
<PB N="205" REF="002775_0220_0FE631B261344A38"/>Days of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> there was one Order of <HI>Bishops</HI> &amp; another of <HI>Presbyters? The Protestant Churches hold the Negative, &amp; the Papists the Affir∣mative.</HI></Q> The Consequence upon the whole is, That notwithstanding the Charge of <HI>Schism,</HI> so ignorantly &amp; injuriously laid elswhere, there can be nothing more <HI>Schismatical,</HI> than to make a <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy</HI> a <HI>Term of Communion</HI> in the Churches of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>Having reported the <HI>Practices</HI> used in the Chur∣ches of <HI>New-England,</HI> it might be thought not a∣miss to add this Report of their <HI>Sentiments,</HI> upon an Article with which the Interests of Religion in the World have been very much affected. They do not ask to be under any <HI>Episcopal Jurisdiction,</HI> but that of Him who is the Great <HI>Shepherd &amp; Bi∣shop of Souls.</HI> This they know, That there are ma∣ny Parishes in <HI>England,</HI> which by <HI>Law</HI> are <HI>Exemp∣ted</HI> from <HI>Episcopal Jurisdiction;</HI> And as this is a very plain Demonstration, that the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>England</HI> looks on <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy</HI> as a meer <HI>Hu∣mane Constitution,</HI> so, the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> may certainly with as much Reason, as any in the Realm of <HI>England,</HI> expect such an <HI>Exemption</HI> to be allowed &amp; preserv'd unto them. 'Twill be thought enough to them, if the <HI>Great Shepherd of the Sheep</HI> keep the <HI>Flocks in the Wilderness</HI> under His gracious <HI>Inspection, &amp; lead them in the Paths of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>No more is now called for.</P>
<P>In Exhibiting unto the Churches in the <HI>other Hemisphere,</HI> the Relation of what is practised in these Regions of <HI>America,</HI> that Article of our Creed,
<PB N="206" REF="002775_0221_0FE631B264CBE430"/><HI>The Communion of Saints,</HI> has been considered. But how far this Relation may Recommend the Chur∣ches of <HI>New-England</HI> unto the Affection &amp; Fellow∣ship of those on the Eastern side of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> 'tis what waits for the Experiment. Certainly, The worst they can look for, is to be <HI>Charitably Pitied, and Instructed in their Weaknesses!</HI></P>
<P>It will doubtless <HI>Hearten</HI> them, when they are told, That an Illustrious Minister of State, than whom, for Uncommon Erudition, as well as the other Accomplishments that may brighten a Man of Honour, our Nation has not [and perhaps ne∣ver had!] a Greater; having had the State of this Country truly laid before him, he condescended so far as to write in these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bliging Terms unto One of the <HI>New-English</HI> Divines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon it; <HI>The Ac∣count of the State of your Country was very Acceptable to me; And wherein I can serve either It or You, I shall be always Ready. It is great Matter of Joy, that the Christian Religion and Learning, do make such con∣siderable Advances in those Parts of the World; and indeed, wherever the Christian Religion is proposed in its Native Plainness, and Simplicity, it is most likely to succeed.</HI></P>
<P>After so Important a Smile upon them, they cannot but perswade themselves, that none but the <HI>Unreasonable Men that have no Faith,</HI> will go to <HI>dis∣turb</HI> them, in the <HI>Peaceable Enjoyment</HI> of that <HI>Evan∣gelical Church-State,</HI> for the sake of which they made a <HI>Peaceable Secession</HI> into what was then, a <HI>Great and a Terrible Wilderness.</HI> Yea, They <HI>Comfort</HI> them∣selves in some Expectation, that if their <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> be not any where else presently Con∣form'd unto, yet so far as <HI>Reason</HI> comes to prevail
<PB N="207" REF="002775_0222_0FE631BB6893D140"/>and Govern, the <HI>Principles</HI> which they profess to act upon, will be every were more &amp; more es∣poused in the World. They are Principles that will bear the <HI>Test,</HI> and the more they are <HI>Tried,</HI> the more they will <HI>come forth as Gold.</HI></P>
<P>And if <HI>none else</HI> be edifyed by it, yet this <HI>Pub∣lication</HI> of their <HI>Principles &amp; Practices</HI> will certainly prove <HI>their own Confirmation,</HI> in the Ways of <HI>Scrip∣tural Purity,</HI> wherein they have hitherto proceed∣ed &amp; prospered. The more they <HI>Scan</HI> what they <HI>Do,</HI> the more they will <HI>Hold fast what they have,</HI> and <HI>let no Man take away their Crown.</HI> When GOD has blessed the Ministry in these Churches for se∣veral Generations, with a <HI>Success of the Gospel,</HI> that was hardly ever exceeded on the Face of the Earth, it will be an intolerable thing unto them, to hear Foolish &amp; Romish Bigots tell them, They have no True <HI>Ministers &amp; Sacraments</HI> among them. And however a <HI>Few,</HI> on certain <HI>Temptations</HI> may now &amp; then Desert the Holy Ways wherein the <HI>Religion of the Second Commandment</HI> has been main∣tained among them, it will be strange, if the Cha∣racter of the <HI>Deserters,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Lights</HI> which lead them, should not prove a powerful Antidote, a∣gainst any great Accession to the <HI>Apostacy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Motto</HI> of the Churches will be, STANT RELIGIONE PARENTUM; And with a per∣petual &amp; inviolate Adherence to their Glorious LORD, and the Directions of His WORD, they will forever say, <HI>He is my GOD, and I will prepare Him an Habitation, my Fathers GOD, and I will Ex∣alt Him.</HI></P>
