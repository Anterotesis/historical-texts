<HEAD>The Preface,</HEAD>
<P>IN Managing Controversies in Religion, there be two usual Artifices that frequently prove traps to catch the Injudicious Mul∣titude, and sway more with unthinking Men than a Demonstration; one is to insinuate that the impleaded Opinion is contra∣ry to Purity and Holiness; a way to corrupt the Churches and usher in degeneracy: hereby many men of tender Consciences are startled, as if there were a Snake in the Grass; the o∣ther is a magnifying of such Authors, as do discountenance, or seem to discountenance that Opinion, as if they were but one degree be∣neath the Apostles, <HI>they have mens Persons in Ad∣miration because of Advantage,</HI> which proves like a Charm to many Readers, being ready to swallow all with an implicit Faith. How far Mr. <HI>M.</HI> hath acted his part in these two Me∣thods, is obvious to any that observe: the lat∣ter of them especially is his proper Element. But these are but flourishes, that may raise mens Spirits, but convey no light into their Under∣standings: they may serve to garnish &amp; adorn either Truth or Errour, but strengthen neither of them. Let him but prove his Doctrine to be true, and we will believe it to be a preser∣vative
<PB REF="001433_0004_0FB2F013F00D3948"/>of the Purity of the Church; let him but confirm his Doctrine from Divine Autho∣rity, and we will receive it, whether his Au∣thors, do deserve their high Character or not.</P>
<P>It is no offence to me that Mr. <HI>M.</HI> has under∣taken to answer me; if he could have proved my Assertion to be a mistake, it would have been a kindness to me. I heartily desire to be led into the knowledge of the Truth; and would be as forward as any to bear a testimo∣ny against that doctrine, could I be convinced of any error in it. But I hope his insufficiency to accomplish his design, will prove an advan∣tage to the cause of God, and be a means fur∣ther to Establish such as were wavering: his Arguments though propounded in a plausible manner, and set off with fair glosses, are too weak to bear a touch, and will appear upon Examination to have in them more of Orna∣ment than of Evidence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> all along intermingles Passionate Lamentations with his Arguments; if his Argu∣ments had been stronger, they would have been a Vindication of those complaints; and he had done his business effectually, if there had been more reason and less affection in his Book. Those Lamentations serve to swell the Book, and make it more in bulk, but not in weight.</P>
<P>It is my endeavour to keep my heart as far from prejudice and bias as I can, that I may be prepared to give entertainment to the Truth: which is indeed worthy of entertainment, how∣ever our interests be crossed thereby, we are
<PB REF="001433_0005_0FB2F0162FF48128"/>directed to buy the Truth though sometimes it costs us dear. On the one hand, I consider that it would be a doleful thing to Propagate an Errour, and lay a Foundation of the Cor∣ruption of the Land; to spread and diffuse Poison that may have a malignant influence from Generation to Generation, it were better to make Retractation upon Retractation, than to be obstinate in such a way. On the other hand, I consider that it is a Service to God and his People, to clear up a Truth that has not been received, whereby a door is opened for the revival of Religion, and light held forth to deliver the People of God from such mistakes, as are a means to turn many away from fearing the Lord, and it would be very blame-worthy to suffer my self to be basled, with trivial Arguments, great Words &amp; angry Faces; it will quit cost to suffer reproach in the cause of God. I shall not trouble my self to answer reflections or to retort them, but to apply my self to remove such things as are offered to darken the Truth, accounting that the Vindication of the Truth is a Vindication of my self.</P>
<P>He seems to intimate as if I pretended to be a Prophet. I am far from pretending to any Prophetical Revelations; I am no <HI>Enthusiast:</HI> I neither pretend to Revelations my self, nor depend on the Sentiments of other men, as if they were Oracles: but this I profess before the World, that God has taught me the Doctrine that I have laid down; partly by giving me a great
<PB REF="001433_0006_0FB2F019EA0EEFF0"/>discovery of his Wisdom, in bringing Nations into a Church Estate, and in that way com∣municating Saving Grace to his Elect; part∣ly by opening my Eyes to understand the Scriptures, whereby I am abundantly satisfyed that it is the cause of God that I have pleaded, and accordingly, I am bound in Spirit to pur∣sue it, and am contented to Sacrifice my own Name for his sake, knowing that though my Assertion be Offensive to some beloved Bre∣thren, yet it is acceptable to God and Jesus Christ, and pleasing to Angels and Saints in Heaven.</P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="book">
<HEAD>The First BOOK. <HI>The Question Stated, and Mr.</HI> Mather's <HI>Arguments answered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Laws of disputation do require a fair &amp; exact Sta∣ting of the controversy, that nothing be made mat∣ter of dispute, that is not plainly affirmed, or by genuine conse∣quence deduced from the Assertions of the adversary: when men do otherwise, they are guilty of casting unjust imputations, on those whom they oppose, they labour in vain, abuse their Readers, and manifest an affectation of vain glory, from a victory,
<PB N="2" REF="001433_0008_0FB2F02195D16F18"/>where there was no contest. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has greatly failed in this particular. He says, p. 3. <HI>The Question is whether God requires Unsanctified Persons, while such, to come to his Table, and consequently whether the Church may admit into their holy Communion in special Or∣dinance such as are not in the judgment of ra∣tional Charity true Believers.</HI></P>
<P>The first of these Questions is not fair∣ly laid down, my Position is, That Sancti∣fying Grace is not necessary to the lawful attending the Ordinance of the Lords Supper. He says the Question is, <HI>Whether God requires Unsanctifyed Persons, while such, to come to his Table.</HI> Insinuating as if I did affirm, that God required all Unsanctify∣ed Persons to come to his Table. We use to say in disputations, <HI>Adde Signum.</HI> He should have added the sign, and either said some unsanctifyed persons, which I own, or all unsanctifyed persons which (as he knows) I utterly deny.</P>
<P>He adds, that consequently, <HI>the Questi∣on is, whether the Church may admit to their holy Communion in special Ordinances, such as are net in the judgment of rational Charity true Believers.</HI> But I have no controversy with him upon that account. My business was to answer a case of Conscience, and direct
<PB N="3" REF="001433_0009_0FB2F023455F32C8"/>those that might have Scruples about Par∣ticipation of the Lords-Supper, because they had not a work of Saving Conversion, not at all to direct the Churches, to ad∣mit any that were not to rational Charity true Believers; so that he blots a great deal of Paper to no Purpose, beats the air, and fights against a shadow of his own making.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>Mr.</HI> Mather's <HI>first Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ASsertions that are contrary to many Scrip∣tures, ought not to be received by the Churches; but the impleaded Assertions are contrary to many Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>The first Scripture alledged is Matt. 22.11, 12. <HI>And when the King come in to see the Guest, he saw there a man that had not on a wedding Garment; &amp; he saith unto him, friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wed∣ding Garment? And he was speechless.</HI> He says upon it, <HI>That it is evident, that they who come to the Lords Table without a Wedding Garment are Guests more hold than welcome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The thing to be enquired into is. What is this Feast that the guests were in∣vited to? Mr. <HI>M.</HI> supposes it to be the Lords Supper: that is easier a great deal then to prove it. It is abundantly manifest that Christ Jesus, and Pardon &amp; Salvation are
<PB N="4" REF="001433_0010_0FB2F0246A0D7508"/>the Feast, that they were invited to, &amp; not the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: the Messengers of God are sent to invite men to this Feast: and I think he will not say, that the great errand of the Ministry is to invite men to the Lords Supper: be∣sides this is a Feast that the Jews were in∣vited to from Generation to Generation, long before the Lords-Supper was Institu∣ted. The Jews were those <HI>that were bid∣den:</HI> v. 3. <HI>He sent forth his Servants to those that were bidden, to the Wedding, and they would not come:</HI> One set of Servants af∣ter another were sent unto them: <HI>v.</HI> 4. <HI>Again he sent other Servants:</HI> First he sent the Prophets and then the Apostles, after this the Gentiles were invited to the same Feast, <HI>v.</HI> 9. <HI>Go ye into the high ways, &amp; as many as ye shall find, bid unto the Marriage.</HI> Besides this man that had not the Wedding Garment was not suffered to partake of this Feast, but such persons are suffered to par∣take of the Lords Supper; besides this per∣son that was objected against for not having a Wedding Garment, was a Reprobate, <HI>v.</HI> 14. <HI>Many are called, but few are chosen:</HI> but Mr. <HI>M.</HI> dont think that every one that ven∣tures to partake of the Lords Supper with∣out Grace, is a Reprobate. By this it does appear that here is a representation of the
<PB N="5" REF="001433_0011_0FB2F0284B5FF8D8"/>Day of Judgment, and that such Persons as come for Salvation without a Wedding Garment shall be rejected in that day. So that here being nothing spoken about the Lords Supper, all arguing from this Scrip∣ture falls to the ground. <HI>See Pools Anot. in Locum.</HI></P>
<P>Another Scripture that he urges is, 1 Cor. 11.27, 29. <HI>Whosoever shall, eat this bread &amp; drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body &amp; blood of the Lord. He that eats &amp; drinks unworthily eats &amp; drinks Damnation,</HI> (or Judgment) <HI>to himself:</HI> Hence he argues, <HI>That if the unworthiness of a particular act in respect of the manner of do∣ing it, may make a man guilty: how much more the unworthiness of his person.</HI> This is as if he should argue that an unworthy manner of Hearing, makes a man guilty, therefore much more the unworthiness of his per∣son, &amp; therefore graceless persons should refrain from hearing.</P>
<P>But this Scripture being a stumbling-block to many, it is meet it should be more fully considered. Mind therefore.</P>
<P N="1">1. It doth not follow that if they eat &amp; drink Judgment to themselves that they should forbear. Natural men Sin when they Pray, when they Hear, so they did
<PB N="6" REF="001433_0012_0FB2F029C51BDC80"/>of old when they offered Sacrifice; and they expose themselves to the Judgment of God; but it dont follow that they must forbear.</P>
<P N="2">2. That true Believers may eat &amp; drink unworthily. The Apostle doth not speak of unworthy Communicants, but unwor∣ty Communicating. He supposes the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> to consist of such as were Believers, yet he supposeth that some of them did eat &amp; drink unworthily: <HI>v.</HI> 30. He says, <HI>For this cause many among you are weak &amp; sickly:</HI> yet it doth not follow that they must forbear.</P>
<P N="3">3. Natural men may eat &amp; drink with∣out that unworthiness or unmeetness that the Apostle speaks of (1) Because the A∣postle doth express this unworthiness to lye in not discerning the Lords body. <HI>v.</HI> 29. <HI>He that eateth &amp; drinketh unworthily, eateth &amp; drinketh Damnation to himself: not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>scerning the Lords body.</HI> That is, not dis∣ferencing that bread from common bread. (1) Because the worthiness or unworthi∣ness here intended is that which may be known before hand. Therefore he advi∣ses them, <HI>to Examine themselves, v.</HI> 28. But no man can tell by any previous Examina∣tion whether he shall eat &amp; drink in saith
<PB N="7" REF="001433_0013_0FB2F02B4F342A88"/>or not. A Godly man if he find the Ex∣ercise of faith the night before, or that Morning, may yet in his attending on the Lords-Supper be left unto a Spirit of un∣belief; and a Natural man if he finds the Night before that he never had faith, may yet partake in faith. I knew one recom∣mended to our Communion from another Church, as an eminent Saint, who was af∣terwards fully convinced of being in a State of Nature, and at the Sacrament wought on, &amp; enabled to believe in Christ. (3) Because the Apostle speaks these words, not to restrain any of the Church of <HI>Co∣rinth</HI> from coming to the Lords-Supper, but to direct them to come in a right man∣ner, not in that rude &amp; unchristian way that they were wont to come: which he had told them of; <HI>v.</HI> 20, 21.</P>
<P>The Reverend Author adds, that the Apostles words, 1 Cor. 11.28. <HI>Let a man Ex∣amine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, &amp; drink of that cup: are contrary to my new doctrine.</HI> Two things he insists upon from this Scripture: the first is, that the Exami∣nation here required is, whether he has grace in his Soul; and would prove it thus. <HI>Saith he, Doth not the Apostle himself plainly tell us, what he means by this self-Examination:</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001433_0014_0FB2F02DAAB067E0"/>2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your selves whether you be in the faith, prove your own selves, know you not your own selves, how that Christ is in you, except you be reprobates; that is persons nor ap∣proved.</HI> But what force is there in this Argument, doth it follow, because by self Examination, in one place he intends their Examining whether they be in a State of grace, that therefore when ever he speaks of Self Examination, the thing to be Exami∣ned is the truth of grace: it is granted on all hands, that the truth of grace is to be Examined, but this doth not prove that that is the thing called for and intended, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.28. Yea it is most evident, that this is not the Examination that they are stirred up unto: if we look to the forego∣ing verses where he blames them for Com∣municating in a rude manner, or if we look to the <HI>subsequent words,</HI> where he finds fault with those that don't discern the <HI>Lords body,</HI> it plainly appears that the Examination he called for is, whether they understood the nature of the Ordinance, that so they may solemly consider what they have to do when they wait upon God in it. The thing to be Examined is not the worthiness of their persons, but the worthiness of their participation. A second thing that he in∣sists upon, tho' not in this Book, yet in a∣nother
<PB N="9" REF="001433_0015_0FB2F02F42854F38"/>that he put forth some years since, upon the like occasion, is, that the Greek word rendred <HI>Examine,</HI> does import an <HI>Examination to Approbation:</HI> surely he is too critical therein, for though the Word does sometimes import so, yet not always: the same word is used, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. &amp; rendred <HI>Prove:</HI> where the Apostle said <HI>Prove your own selves.</HI> For that was not the duty of all of them to prove themselves to Appro∣bation. It was in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> as in other Churches, some were sincere, and some were hypocrites, and it is as much the duty of hypocrites to discover their hypocrisy, as of Saints to discover their Sincerity: it is their duty to Exa∣amine themselves to disapprobation. Be∣sides if Communicants must Examine their saith to approbation, I would inquire whether by that approbation, he means Assurance or a probable hope. If he in∣tends Assurance, then none but those that have Assurance may come to the Lords∣Table. If he intends a probable hope: then such persons may come as are not sincere, and then Sanctifying grace is not necessary in order to a lawful attending the Lords-Supper.</P>
<P>A third Scripture that he brings to make good his Argument is, Ezek. 44.7, 9. <HI>You
<PB N="10" REF="001433_0016_0FB2F03125845AD8"/>have brought into my Sanctuary strangers, un∣circumcised in heart, &amp; uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my Sanctuary to pallute it, even my house: when you offer my Bread, the Fat, and the Blood, and they have broken my Covenant. — Thus saith the Lord, no stranger uncir∣cumcised in beart, shall enter into my Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>I Answer, 1. That this Scripture has no particular reference to the Lords-Sup∣per. If he had blamed them for suffering such persons as were uncircumcised in heart and flesh to come to the Passover, which was a Sacrament of confirmation as the Lords Supper is, he might have pleaded that it had a particular reference to the Lords Supper, but the fault was that they brought strangers into the Sanctuary: but the Passover was eaten in their own houses.</P>
<P N="2">2. The fault is charged on the Priests, that they brought in such as were uncir∣cumcised in flesh &amp; in heart: therefore it must necessarily be understood of such as were visibly uncircumcised in heart; for the Priests were not to blame for letting in such as were visibly circumcised in heart, though not really so: for they were bound by Gods Ordinance to do it. Yea Mr. <HI>M.</HI> goes a great deal further than I
<PB N="11" REF="001433_0017_0FB2F038F64032E8"/>dare go, for he says, That Adulterers, Thieves, Liars, Slanderers &amp; Perjured Per∣sons might celebrate the Passover, <HI>p.</HI> 75, 76. How to reconcile such practices with heart circumcision is quite beyond me.</P>
<P>Here our Reverend Author informs us, <HI>That the Jewish Masters tell us, that their Fa∣thers were very strict in admitting of Proselytes, they say they admitted no Proselytes in Davids time, least they should join themselves to his Peo∣ple out of fear; nor in Solomons time, least they should come because of the great Prosperity that Israel then had.</HI></P>
<P>To which I may Answer in the Apostles words, 1 Tim. 1.4. <HI>Neither give beed to fa∣bles.</HI> If it were really so it was utterly cross to the institution of God: <HI>Exod.</HI> 12.47, 48. but undoubtedly the thing is utterly false: <HI>David</HI> mentions the Prose∣lytes in his time, as a great body of People: Psal. 115.12, 13. <HI>He will bless the house of Is∣rael, he will bless the house of Aaron, be will bless them that fear the Lord.</HI> By them that fear the Lord, we are to understand the Proselytes. So Psal. 135.19, 20. <HI>Bless the Lord O house of Israel, bless the Lord O house of Aaron, bless the Lord O house of Levi: Ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.</HI> Proselytes in the Old Testament are called <HI>Fearers of
<PB N="12" REF="001433_0018_0FB2F03C03032610"/>God,</HI> in the New-Testament, they are cal∣led <HI>Worshippers of God:</HI> Act. 16.14. And Solomon in his Prayer, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8.41, 42. Saith, That <HI>the stranger shall come from afar Country, for Gods Name sake, hearing of his Great Name, and his Strong Hand.</HI></P>
<P>The next Scripture that he urges is, <HI>Lev.</HI> 7.20. <HI>The soul that eats of the flesh of the Sa∣crifice of Peace-offerings that partain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his People. To which he adds, That such as were unclean might not eat the Passover: and saith, Doth not this ty∣pifie, that they who are unclean, either in course of Life, or in State should not come to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lords Supper.</HI> He doth not ask me, for he knows that I affirm, that the Ordinances of the Old Testament, were not Types of the Ordinances of the New Testament.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I stand to my former Answer: notwithstanding any thing he saith to the contrary: he brings Dr. <HI>Whitaker</HI> &amp; Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> against my Assertion; but indeed there has been such variety of Opinions in the World, that men may bring humane authority, yea the Testimony of deserving men for almost any mistake. The word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is equivocal: so <HI>Adam</HI> is said to be <HI>a Figure or Type, the word is, of him that was to come.</HI> So we read, Act. 7.43. <HI>They took
<PB N="13" REF="001433_0019_0FB2F03ED4F1E0A0"/>up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the Star of your God Remphan, figures or types which you made.</HI> So 1 Cor. 10, 11. <HI>All things are said to happen to them for Ensamples or Types:</HI> but a Type properly is some instituted resem∣blance of some Gospel Truth; and the Ordinances of the Jewish Church were not instituted to be resemblances of the Or∣dinances of the New-Testament: they did not instruct the Church of the Jews in Gos∣pel Ordinances. Was Circumcision institu∣ted to instruct the Church of the Jews for a∣bove <HI>two thousand</HI> years, that <HI>Baptism</HI> should be appointed in the Christian Church, and that it must be administred with such and such circumstances? The like I may say of the Passover and the Sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> neither were they instituted to teach us Gospel Ordinances; we may receive some Edification from them: but we are under better Ordinances, &amp; a more glorious dis∣pensation. Those Ordinances were ap∣pointed of old to teach the Ancient Church, the way of Salvation by Christ. Col. 2.17. <HI>They were a shadow of good things to come, but the body is of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Baptismus saccessit circumcisioni, caena Domi∣nica Paschati. Non tamen successerunt ut cor∣pus umbra, signatum signo, sed ut ritas novi, ritibus veteribus, ut figurae clariores, de re

<P>The Rd. Author saith, That <HI>I pretend that unclean persons were not allowed to come to the Passover, to signifie that those who are spiritually unclean shall be excluded out of hea∣ven. But he objects, That</HI> Erastus <HI>the most corrupt writer about Church discipline said so long before me.</HI> But what then, <HI>E'rastus</HI> did not always lye. Mr. <HI>Gillespy,</HI> one of his Oracles, owns the thing, when he saith, That shutting out of Heaven is not the only thing thereby signifyed, tho' the rea∣son that he gives to shew that it is not the only thing signifyed thereby is very frivo∣lous, for similitudes are not wont to run on all four.</P>
<P>He concludes this Chapter with telling us, <HI>That the light of nature dictates, that un∣holy Persons should not meddle with holy things.</HI> Then it seems to be contrary to the light of nature that Unregenerate men should be Circumcised, come to the Passover, Sacrifice, Pray, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<PB N="15" REF="001433_0021_0FB2F041EC832440"/>
<HEAD>Mr. Mather's <HI>Second Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THey that are not duly qualifyed to be Members of particular Gospel Churche, are not fit to be admitted to the Lords Supper, but Unsanctifyed persons are not fit to be admit∣ted Members in particular Churches.</HI></P>
<P>The major is granted. There is no need to take notice of his discourse upon it, because it is a digression, and concerns not the matter in controversy.</P>
<P>But the minor is utterly denyed: Some Unsanctifyed persons are fit to be admit∣ted Members in particular Churches, they that are fit matter for Church Membership, are to be admitted: but visible Saints tho' they are hypocrites, are fit matter for Church Membership: they that are to be admitted according to the Ordinance of God are fit to be admitted. Such as must be admitted or else God will be greatly offended, are fit to be admitted: Such as being admitted may not be cast out, are fit to be admitted. But thus it is with vi∣sible Saints: though they have not a tho∣row work of Conversion; such persons as God himself did admit into the Church of Israel, are fit to be admitted into Gos∣pel
<PB N="16" REF="001433_0022_0FB2F0467B96A380"/>Churches: such persons as the Apo∣stles did admit into Gospel Churches are fit to be admitted into them, but they ad∣mitted many that had not a thorow work of Regeneration. Indeed by the rule that God has given for admissions, if it be care∣fully attended, more Unconverted persons will be admitted than Converted. <HI>Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>saith, let Ministers use as much dili∣gence &amp; vigilancy as well they may, yet such is the dimness of discerning in humane frailty, and such is the subtilty of many hypocrites, that it may be Ninety nine hypocrites may creep into the Church to one simple sheep of Christ.</HI> Hol. of Ch. M. p. 67. and Preached it in <HI>Boston, That it would be well if at the day of judgment ten men in a Church were saved.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> that he may strengthen his Opinion heaps up many Scriptures to show, that Church Members should be visible Saints; he has no need to trouble himself to prove that which I never deny'd, all the titles that are given them don't make them more, and I never desired to make them less than visible Saints, the members of the Christian Church are visible Saints, &amp; the members of the Jewish Church were visible Saints, as they are called, <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.7. So <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.3. <HI>Yea he loved the people, all his Saint's are in thy hand.</HI> It was needless for him
<PB N="17" REF="001433_0023_0FB2F047B13EC7F0"/>to prove it, &amp; unfair by taking so much pains to prove it, to leave a jealousy upon some ignorant people, as if I did deny it.</P>
<P><HI>He saith, Hypocrites were brought in una∣wars, and that they crept in unawares:</HI> but neither of these places that he refers to do intimate that all hypocrites do come in unaware: that <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.4. Speaks of some Jews that pretended themselves to be Christians but were not, but came in upon a wicked design. Surely he does not think so hardly of all that fall short of a work of Regeneration. Those words <HI>Jude</HI> 4. are spoken of heretical persons: if they did take any in, that they feared had not Saving Faith, yet surely none that they judged to be Heriticks. He con∣tends with me for saying, that Saints by Calling are to be accepted of the Church, whether they be Converted or no: speaks of it as a <HI>Strange expression and a contradiction in adjecto:</HI> but what need is there of so much anger. Visible Saints are Saints by Calling. The Members of the Church of Corinth, <HI>were called to be Saints,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.2. There is an external Call and an external Answer, as well as an in∣ternal Call and an internal Answer: If visible Saints may be Saints by Calling,
<PB N="18" REF="001433_0024_0FB2F04973A4C788"/>and visible Saints may be Unconverted, then some that are Saints by Calling may be Unconverted.</P>
<P>He saith, That when their hypocrisy is discovered by any fundamental Error in judgment, or scandal, or in Conversation, they ought to be cast out of the Church. But he mistakes the matter very much: the discovery of their hypocrisy is not the reason of their being cast out: When men are cast out of the Church we don't know that they are hypocrites or not: the reason of their rejection is because they are ob∣stinate in Scandal. And Godly men are to be rejected in that case, as well as hypocrites.</P>
<P><HI>He saith, That Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>argues, that such as are destructive to the State of the Church, are not fit Materials for the building of the Church. And adds, That this is true of hypo∣crites.</HI> Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> position is good, but Mr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s addition will not stand: For hypocrites so long as they carry well, are not destructive to the State of the Church: but on the contrary do great Service to the Church, they help to maintain the Church and Ordinances of God, they do desend the Church, they do incourage the Church, they are Serviceable by their gifts, by their
<PB N="19" REF="001433_0025_0FB2F04AB8CAECD8"/>authority, by their prudence &amp; zeal, by their Estates; and it would be exceeding difficult for the Church to subsist without them. When he saith that they are de∣structive to the State of the Church, does it not reflect on the Wisdom of God in binding and commanding his Church to admit such Members? That constitution of the Church that God has appointed, is such as makes for the safety and well be∣ing of the Church: and God has appoin∣ted that visible Saints shall be accepted as Members of the Church, though they be not Regenerate; and the Apostles them∣selves accepted such.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. Mather's <HI>Third Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>IF men meddle with that which they have no right unto, they have not a divine allow∣ance for their doing so: But when Unsanctify∣ed Persons come, they meddle with that, which they have no right unto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The minor is denyed. In the prosecution of it there is a great deal of confusedness and obscurity: Sometimes he speaks of them that are Unregenerate and have no right before God, though they have before men: sometimes he speaks
<PB N="20" REF="001433_0026_0FB2F04CEAF84E20"/>of them to whom we cannot in charita∣ble judgment say. The blood of Christ has obtained for you the remission of your Sins: and of giving the Sacrament to those who are not so far as men can judge in a Regenerate Estate: and he saith, that this is to set the Lords Seal to a blank. But I will labour to answer the intent of this argument, so far as I am able to reach it.</P>
<P>That which I am to shew is, That some Unsanctifyed men have a right before God to the Lords Supper. Surely the Children of Israel had a right before God to the Passover; when God commanded them to celebrate it; and they had a right to Circumcision, when God commanded <HI>Joshua</HI> to circumcise them. And those that are the Covenant People of God have a right <HI>to keep the Covenant;</HI> we are com∣manded <HI>to teach such as are baptised to observe all things that Christ hath commanded,</HI> Mat. 28.19, 20. The second Command requires men to observe and keep pure &amp; intire all such Religious Worship &amp; Ordinances as God requireth in his word.</P>
<P>If I may gather up what he aims at, I would reduce it to these two heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Unregenerate men are not in Covenant with God. This is a great
<PB N="21" REF="001433_0027_0FB2F0585A51A3F0"/>mistake, tho' Unregenerate men are not in the internal, they have not performed any act of Saving Faith, which is the con∣dition of the Covenant, and God is not bound to give Saving Blessings of the Co∣venant to them: yet they are in the ex∣ternal Covenant. <HI>Moses saith, the Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb,</HI> Deut. 5.2. And when he renews his Covenant, he is said to <HI>betroth them to himself,</HI> Hos. 2.19, 20. And therefore the Adoption is said to belong to them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.4. They are his People, his Sons &amp; Daughters, his Spouse, and he becomes their God, he makes pro∣mises unto them upon condition of Obe∣dience, and they promise Obedience un∣to him. Hence they become capable of breaking Covenant; they have <HI>broken the everlasting Covenant,</HI> Isai. 24.5. <HI>Neither were they stedfast in his Covenant,</HI> Psal. 78.37.</P>
<P N="2">2. That because they have no right to the blessings of the New Covenant, there∣fore they have no right to the Seal. That the Sacrament may not be given to them because their Sins are not pardoned: they have no right to Salvation, therefore not to the Seal of Salvation, if the Seal be given to them, it is the setting of the Lords Seal to a blank: Sealing a Pardon to those
<PB N="22" REF="001433_0028_0FB2F05B2AF35898"/>whom the Lord hath not pardoned.</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>To this I make answer in three particulars,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That tho' Unregenerate men have no right to pardon of Sin &amp; Salvation, yet they may have a right before God unto the Seals of the Covenant; they had a right to Circumcision: <HI>Josh.</HI> 5.2. yet that was a Seal of the righteousness of Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11. So they had right to the Passo∣ver, and so they have to Baptism. It is unreasonable to think that all Baptised Children are Regenerate: and so they may have a right to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Unregenerate men may have in conjunction with other, a right to some of the blessings of the Covenant. The Sacra∣ments are Seals of the whole Covenant, not only those promises that are made to particular Believers, but the promises of outward prosperity that are made to the visible Church: &amp; men that are Unrege∣nerate in Conjunction with others, have a right as part of the body Corporate to those blessings, and may receive the Seal thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Sacraments do not Seal up Pardon and Salvation to all that re∣ceive them, but they are Seals to the truth
<PB N="23" REF="001433_0029_0FB2F05CC1DFACE0"/>of the Covenant. It doth not Seal mens having of faith, neither doth it Seal the Salvation of the Communicants; they mi∣serably deceive themselves, if they under∣stand it so: but it is a Seal to the Covenant. God offers Pardon and Salvation through faith in Christ, men are ready to doubt of the truth of this; but God Seals this Co∣venant in the Sacraments. This is that which is intended when it is said, That Circumcision was a <HI>Seal of the Righteousness of Faith,</HI> Rom. 4.11. Whether we understand by the righteousness of faith, Faith it self, which is our Evangelical righteousness, or the righteousness of Christ, which is <HI>Faith</HI> apprehended by <HI>Christ,</HI> it comes to one &amp; the same: and circumcision Seals the effi∣cacy of this unto Salvation; that the pro∣mise that he has made shall in this way be fulfilled: and this is a great incourage∣ment to draw forth the Exercise of Faith.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>Mr. Mather's <HI>Fourth Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>IF the Sacrament were a Converting Ordi∣nance, and that therefore Unregenerate Per∣sons should come to it in order to their being Con∣verted, there would doubtless be some promise or some example recorded in the Scripture of person<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="24" REF="001433_0030_0FB2F05E2EC89BB8"/>so Converted for the encouragement of others. But there is neither Promise nor Example.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Both parts of this argument are to be denyed. And there is very little said for the proof of either.</P>
<P N="1">1. I deny the Consequence. It may be a Converting Ordinance, though there be neither promise nor example. I may ar∣gue as well, that if there be no promise in the word of the Edification of Saints an∣nexed to it, nor any Example of Saints edifyed thereby, then it is no Ordinance for the Edification of Saints. Yea I may as well argue that there is no promise of converting Grace, annexed to circumcisi∣on, nor any Example of Persons Conver∣ted by it, therefore that was no Ordinance for Conversion. But there be other things that do shew it to be a converting Ordi∣nance, as the command given to the Church, which doth consist partly of men Converted, partly of men Unconverted, to attend this Ordinance. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25. <HI>This do in remembrance of me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. I deny the Minor also. There be general promises that do reach the case: Prov. 8.34. <HI>Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors:</HI> This being one of the
<PB N="25" REF="001433_0031_0FB2F060A6EE00E0"/>ways of Gods appointment, this promise is an encouragement to wait upon God in this way. Mat. 28.20. <HI>Teaching them to ob∣serve all things that I have commanded, &amp; lo I am with you alway even to the end of the world;</HI> this is one of Christ commands. Rom. 10.14. <HI>Faith comes by hearing.</HI> In this Ordinance the Gospel is proclamed; and Pardon is offered to Sinners by Jesus Christ: Psal. 19.7. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soul.</HI> This is one of Gods laws.</P>
<P>This Ordinance has a proper tendency in its own nature to Convert men. Here∣in men may learn the necessity &amp; suffici∣ency of the Death of Christ in order to Pardon. Here is an affecting offer of Christ crucifyed; here is a Sealing of the Covenant, that if men come to Christ, they shall be Saved, which is a great means to convince of safety in coming to Christ.</P>
<P>All Ordinances are for the Saving good of those that they are to be administred unto. This Ordinance is according to Institution to be applyed to visible Saints, though Unconverted, therefore it is for their Saving good, and consequently for their Conversion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="argument">
<PB N="26" REF="001433_0032_0FB2F061EA32CF88"/>
<HEAD>Mr. Mather's <HI>Fifth Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Argument is thus presaced, That <HI>it is a clear confutation of what</HI> Mr. S. <HI>affirms:</HI> we will see it. <HI>If the Lords Supper be a converting Ordinance than prophane Per∣sons ought to be admitted to partake of it: but such are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</HI> He saith Mr. S. <HI>himself confesseth thus much.</HI> And it is very true, I wish I could say, that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> did confess, that prophane Per∣sons might not be admitted to the Passover.</P>
<P>I utterly deny his Consequence. His reason for it is, <HI>That we may not withold from the prophanest person in the world, that which is appointed to be the means of his Con∣version.</HI> But his consequence is as strong as a rope of Sand: May we not as well argue that if Baptism be a Converting Or∣dinance, we should Baptize the <HI>Indians,</HI> and other Heathens, as <HI>John Hircanus</HI> did compel the <HI>Edomites</HI> to be circumcised.</P>
<P>My answer was and is, that the Lords Supper is a Converting Ordinance, only for Church Members and not for other men. He hath three objections against my answer. One is, <HI>that it is an odd one.</HI> I hope it is not criminal to give an odd
<PB N="27" REF="001433_0033_0FB2F063A0900F40"/>answer, and if so, let it go for an odd one. The second is, <HI>that it is new of mine own invention.</HI> It is no sufficient ground to reject his notions because they are other mens, or to reject mine because they are my own: it is for God to reveal his mind to any whom he pleases: but the main objection is, <HI>That I do not prove it.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now further vindicate that an∣swer, that it is for the Conversion of or∣derly Church Members, by laying down three Propositions, which Mr. <HI>M.</HI> himself will own.</P>
<P N="1">1. The efficacy of the Lords Supper does depend upon the blessing of God. What ever tendency Ordinances have in their own nature to be Serviceable to men, yet they will not prevail any further than God doth bless them. <HI>The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God,</HI> 2 Cor. 10.4. It is God that teaches men to profit, and makes them profitable and serviceable to mens Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is reason to hope for adivine blessing on the Lords Supper, when it is administred to those that it ought to be administred unto. Gods blessing is to be expected in Gods way: if men act ac∣cording to their own humours &amp; phansies,
<PB N="28" REF="001433_0034_0FB2F0666B1F46B0"/>and don't keep in a way of Obedience, it is presumption to expect Gods blessing. Mat. 15.9. <HI>In vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men:</HI> but when they are admitted to the Lords Sup∣per that God would have to be admitted, there is ground to hope that he will make it profitable.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is Gods will that such as are in the judgment of rational Charity Be∣lievers, be admitted to the Lords Supper, tho' they be Unregenerate: God allows his Church to accept of such Unregenerate men as carry themselves so, that there is reason to look upon them to be Saints, he would not have his Church to admit those that are prophane, that would be a great offence to him; but the Apostles did receive those that were to Charity Be∣lievers, and Churches now ought to re∣ceive such, what-ever they be in reality. From these things it is most apparent that the Lords Supper may be looked on a Converting Ordinance, for Church Mem∣bers that carry orderly, yet not for pro∣phane Persons.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Mather</HI> argues that if the Lords Sup∣per be a converting Ordinance, then it should be administred to prophane. Per∣sons,
<PB N="29" REF="001433_0035_0FB2F06E2092D630"/>may he not with as good reason ar∣gue, that if it be an Ordinance for the strengthning of Grace, it should be admi∣nistred to such Godly men as have fallen into Scandalous transgressions, for they need to have their Grace strengthened.</P>
<P>I had said in my Sermon, that the Lords Supper was a converting Ordinance, only to such Church Members as walked or∣derly, when any carry scandalously there are other Ordinances, <HI>viz.</HI> Censures for their Conversion, in case they be Uncon∣verted. Mr. M. <HI>in answer to this saith,</HI> Disputatur non concessis, <HI>he takes it for granted that the person is not Converted: &amp; so runs out into a long discourse that the incestu∣ous Corinthian might be a godly man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I take it for granted that some Persons censured may be Unconverted, not that all of them are, nor that the <HI>Co∣rinthian</HI> was: and his discourse is wholly impertinent, and altho' he glories in the conclusion of the Chapter, that my new devised distinction is neither Solid nor Scriptural, yet his answer has nothing of an answer in it, as equal judges when they compare things together will readily determine.</P>

<PB N="30" REF="001433_0036_0FB2F07132024EA0"/>
<HEAD>Mr. Mather's <HI>Sixth Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>THat Opinion which is contrary to the Pre∣fession and Practice of the Churches in the Primitive &amp; Purest times of Christianity, and to the judgment of the most eminent Refor∣mers in these latter Ages, and which agress with Papists, and a looser sort of Protestants; ought not to be received among the Churches in</HI> New-England. <HI>But all this is true of</HI> Mr. Stoddard's <HI>Opinion now impleaded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Though this Argument be a three sold cord; yet it is easily broken to pieces. He don't count it a demonstration. It consists of three parts: I shall consider them severally.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He faith that this Opinion is contrary to the Profession &amp; Practice of the Primitive Churches.</HI> This he labours to prove from <HI>Justin Martyr, Origin, Tertullian, Cyprian:</HI> and he faith, <HI>That for about four or five hun∣dred years of the Christian Aera, there was great strictness in admitting to Sacraments.</HI> The like is asserted by him in an Epistle to Mr <HI>Quick;</HI> and he grants that there was too much rigidity among them. And here he faith, That <HI>Chamior, Chemnitius, &amp; Ger∣hard,</HI> commend the strictness of the Pri∣mitive times.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="001433_0037_0FB2F0732EB89DF8"/>
<HI>I Answer,</HI> Here is a great deal of sha∣dow and little substance. The practice in the Primitive Church about the time of <HI>Austin,</HI> was full of Vanity &amp; Superstition. They took in their Members at <HI>Easter</HI> time, or <HI>Pentecost,</HI> they required <HI>Susceptores</HI> or god fathers, though the persons were men grown, they used to Exorcise them, they made them to renounce the Devil as if he were present. When they entered in∣to the Portel of the house of Baptism, they were ordered standing toward the West, with their hand stretched out as if Satan were present, to renounce him, saying, I renounce thee Satan and all thy works, and all thy pomps: sometimes they add∣ed, and his Worship and his Angels, and his Inventions, and all under him. And after-ward they made a Profession, reci∣ting the Creed by heart; which is called a pronouncing of the true Faith, <HI>Praeclara f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ducia,</HI> or else answering to Questions. It was their manner also to use the sign of the Cross, as is evident from <HI>Chamier in his</HI> 15. &amp; 16. ch. <HI>de Baptismo.</HI> This practice of theirs is such a piece of Pageantry, as is more fit for the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to imitate, than these Churches. I admire we should be directed to follow the pattern of these
<PB N="32" REF="001433_0038_0FB2F074B5B6A028"/>ancient Churches under a notion of strict∣ness and purity.</P>
<P>In his other Book made upon the like occasion against me, <HI>viz.</HI> his Epistle to Mr. <HI>Quick, Alcuinus</HI> is brought in saying, <HI>Fiunt scutinia, ut saepius explorentur, an post re∣nunciationem Satanae, Sacra verba datae fidei, radicibus corde defixerint. Scrutinies were made, that they might be often Examined, to see whether the Sacred words of the Faith, which they professed, were throughly fixed in their hearts.</HI> A <HI>New-England</HI> man reading this, would be ready to think, that our practice were but the reviving of the practice of the Primitive Church, but if we search what this Scrutiny was, we may gather it part∣ly from the words of <HI>Austin, ipsis diebus, quibus catechezantur, exorcizantur, scrutantur:</HI> and the words of <HI>Leo</HI> both reported by <HI>Chamier</HI> in the same place, <HI>In Baptizandis electis, qui secundum Apostolicam regulam, &amp; exorcismis scrutandi, &amp; jejuniis Sanctificandi, &amp; frequentibus sunt praedicationibus imbuendi.</HI> By this it appears that this Scrutiny was made by <HI>Exorcisms,</HI> not by inquiring into the works of Gods Spirit on their hearts, but by adjuring of them to Speak true; tho' there was another way of Exorcising in use at this time, <HI>viz.</HI> an adjuring of the
<PB N="33" REF="001433_0039_0FB2F076272291E8"/>Devil to forsake them, by this Examinati∣on, it may easily be perceived, how we may be led into notable mistakes by the quotations of ancient Authors.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He faith this Opinion is contrary to the judgment of the most eminent Reformers in these latter Ages.</HI> Some are mentioned by him.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. That the generality of the Refor∣med Churches are larger than I desire to be, in their practices, and the practice of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is every whit as large.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the judgment of particular Di∣vines: I say,</P>
<P N="1">1. That some of them intend no more, than that those who are admitted to the Lords Supper, be to the judgment of Cha∣rity Believers; as is obvious to those that are conversant in their Books; and I am of the same judgment with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some of these Divines have been guil∣ty of great mistakes in other things, and it is not piacular to suspect them in this. If they be out of the way in this particu∣lar, that adds but one error more to those which they have published.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many Divines have abundance of work before them, and have not opportu∣nity to search narrowly into the points of controversy; but take some things for
<PB N="34" REF="001433_0040_0FB2F07968F250A8"/>granted, from their Education, and are zealous in them without accurate and im∣partial Examination.</P>
<P N="4">4. Many Divines both ancient &amp; modern are strangly to seek about the Doctrine of Regeneration, which might easily lead them into this mistake.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Davenant,</HI> &amp; Dr. <HI>Ward, in vind. gr. Sacramentalis,</HI> teach, 1. <HI>That Sacraments do always give Grace as moral instrumental can∣ses to those that don't put a bar in the way.</HI> 2. <HI>Consequently that by Baptism, Grace or Re∣generation is conveyed to all Infants Elected or not Elected, which Regeneration they call Bap∣tismal, and the first Grace.</HI> 3. <HI>The first Effect of this Grace is the Remission of Original Sin, by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ: upon which depends the inhabitation of the Holy∣Ghost; the first Regeneration, Justification, Adoption.</HI> 4. <HI>By this Grace is bestowed upon Infants a State of Salvation while they are in the condition of Infancy, but not when Adult.</HI> 5. <HI>That this first Grace and Baptismal Regene∣ration, has not an infallible connexion with Salvation, because in their Adult age a bar may be put to the second Regeneration.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Burges de Bapt. Regeneratione Elect. In∣fant:</HI> distinguishes Regeneration into ini∣tial, which he calls <HI>Seminal</HI> &amp; <HI>Potential,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="001433_0041_0FB2F07B8E149D40"/>which consists in a participation of the Spirit of Christ, which is the principle of Spiritual life; and actual Regeneration, which consists in a spiritual Essence, pro∣duced in a Christian by the renewing Spi∣rit, that initial Regeneration he makes to be after Baptism, and binds it up to that as the cause, <HI>sine qua non,</HI> or moral instru∣ment, upon which it follows; to prove this he brings not only the Fathers, and the authority of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but also <HI>Calvin, Chamier, Buc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, Musculus, Junius, Zanchy, Vossius, Jewel, Whitaker, Ames</HI> and <HI>Davenant.</HI></P>
<P>Many Reformed Divines hold the Essi∣cacy of Baptism to consist in Sealing Re∣generation, which was produced before Baptism.</P>
<P><HI>Voetius</HI> faith, <HI>That Elect Infants that have foederal Holiness, have at the same time the in∣ternal Grace of Regeneration;</HI> and instances in <HI>Paul, Manasseh,</HI> and the Thief on the Cross, who, he faith, <HI>were Regenerate from their Infancy.</HI> This Regeneration in Infan∣cy is a spiritual quality or faculty in the mind &amp; will, out of which as out of a cer∣tain Seed and material power, actual dis∣positions &amp; habits by the impression &amp; in∣fusion of the Holy Ghost are in time raised. <HI>Dest.

<P><PB N="36" REF="001433_0042_0FB2F07DA65E9608"/>
Some Divines don't distinguish between Regenerate men, and Professours of good Conversation. Whereas it is evident that men may be very conscientious, &amp; have considerable operations of the Spirit of God upon their hearts, that are not Saving∣ly Converted. Indeed the World has had but little distinct understanding about the work of Conversion, until some latter Di∣vines at <HI>Boston: Norton, Hooker, Shephard,</HI> &amp; some others have held forth light; there was great darkness about the way of Conversion. By this discourse it may ap∣pear how little dependance, we can have on the judgments of Learned and good men; and in our reading must carefully distinguish between the chaff &amp; the wheat.</P>
<P N="5">5. Many Divines are of the same opini∣on with my self. I mentioned <HI>Wendeline</HI> in my Sermon; and whereas Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> faith, there is one Calvinist of my mind, he may see if he have the Book by him, that <HI>Wendeline</HI> doth not only affirm, <HI>That the Sacraments of confirmation may organically begin Faith:</HI> but adds, <HI>That this is the Ortho∣dox Opinion, he Means, the Opinion of the Cal∣vinists.</HI> Exer. 81. pag. 1311. &amp; 12. Mr. <HI>Blake</HI> has written at large also for this, and has answered Mr. <HI>Gillespy</HI>'s twenty arguments.

<P N="3">3. <HI>He saith, This Opinien agrees with Pa∣pists and a looser sort of Protestants.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He would have argued better if he had said that my Opinion was worse than the opinion of the Papists: for accor∣ding to his principles that would have been true: but as he frames his argument, it is a great mistake, tho' he is to be somewhat excused, because I think he hath received this notion by an implicite Faith from Mr.

And he saith, that <HI>Brockmond,</HI> a bitter Lutheran, mentions it as a <HI>Calvinian</HI> error, that Sa∣craments are not instituted to be means of conferring Grace. But what of all this, doth it follow from hence, that they hold that the Lords Supper is a converting Or∣dinance. They never teach that the first Grace is communicated by the Lords Sup∣per, but suppose that to be wrought by Baptism, before ever Persons partake of the Lords Supper. The Council of <HI>Trent</HI> does require a proving of themselves be∣fore they come to the Lords Supper; and they curse those that say, That <HI>Faith alone is sufficient preparation for the Lords Supper. Hist. Conc. Tri. p.</HI> 274, 275.

<HEAD>Mr. Mather's <HI>Seventh Argument.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>IF it be impossible for Unregenerate Persons whilst such, to be worthy Communicints at the Lords Table, then they have no command or allowance from God to be there whilst in their Sins. But it is impossible for them to be worthy Communicants.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I deny the minor.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we take communicating worthily in the Apostles sense, 1 Cor. 11.29. <HI>For discerning the Lords body,</HI> it is not impossible for them to communicate worthily; they may understand the nature of the Ordi∣nance very well, and be able to instruct others in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we take communicating worthily in his sense, for exercising Faith &amp; other Graces, at the time of participation, it is not impossible for those that came to the Ordinance in an Unregenerate condition to partake worthily. God may give them Grace at that time. Mr. <HI>Timson</HI> who was bred up under Mr. <HI>Robert Bolton,</HI> and wrote two Books judiciously upon this Subject, to the good acceptance of many Godly and Learned men, received the first im∣pression of Gods Grace at this Ordinance.
<PB N="40" REF="001433_0046_0FB2F08B39332C58"/>As Mr. <HI>John Humphry</HI> gives the Account. And indeed all men when they come to the Lords Supper, depend upon the help of God for communicating in Faith; if God don't assist Godly men, it is impossible for them to do it; and if God do not change the hearts of natural men, it is impossible for them to do it. But one and the other must ly in Gods way and so wait upon him for his Grace.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> blames me for saying, That it is not to be imagined, that all that were Baptized by <HI>John</HI> were Regenerate; or judged by him to be so: and saith, I do not confirm my Assertion with any rea∣son. <HI>p.</HI> 65. I shall give him a reason now: that they were not all Regenerate appears from, Joh. 5.35. <HI>John was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoyce in his light.</HI> That <HI>John</HI> did not think them to be so, appears because, he knew that many were called and few were chosen: and that <HI>the Kingdom of God is like a net, that was cast into the Sea and gathered of every kind,</HI> as Christ teaches us, <HI>Math.</HI> 13.47.</P>
<P>He takes notice, that I say, <HI>If Unregene∣rate persons might not be Baptized, the Pharisees would not have been blamed for neglecting
<PB N="41" REF="001433_0047_0FB2F08CD497DDA8"/>Baptism. And saith, that</HI> Mr. S. <HI>implies that John would have Baptized them, but that they refused to be Baptized by him. Whereas the truth is other-wise, they would have been Bap∣tized but John refused to Baptize them.</HI> And he brings several Authors to confirm it. <HI>p.</HI> 66, 67.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> What they say is no ways con∣tradictory to what I say. It is very pro∣per to say, that <HI>John</HI> would have Baptized them, if he were willing to do it upon such conditions as they were able to per∣form: he required of them to bring forth fruits meet for repentance, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.8. that is to behave themselves as Saints; this they might have done, tho' Unregenerate. And it is very proper to say, that they re∣fused to be Baptized, because they did refuse it upon those terms that <HI>John</HI> propo∣sed. He that has a mind to a Commodi∣ty, but will not go to the price of it, doth refuse it. If they had renounced their Errors and Superstitions and reformed their lives, <HI>John</HI> would not have refused them, tho' there had been no Saving change in their hearts, but their neglect∣ing those things, was a refusing of Bap∣tism.</P>

<HEAD>The Second BOOK. <HI>The Arguments of</HI> Mr. Vines, Mr. Bax∣ter, <HI>and</HI> Mr. Charnock, <HI>Answered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. Vine's <HI>first Argument. No Effects can be ascribed to this Sacrament of the Supper, that fall not under the signification of it: One thing is not signifyed and another wrought. But the Conversion of a Sinner is not signifyed by this Sacrament of the Supper.</HI></P>
<P>I premise, that this Argument is as strong against the Passover, being a con∣verting Ordinance, whereas we know that by institution that was to be attended by Unconverted men.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I deny the minor. Eating &amp; Drink∣ing at the Sacrament does signify feeding upon Christ; when men do act faith up∣on Christ, they are said to feed upon the body &amp; blood of Christ. Joh. 6.53, 54. <HI>Ex∣cept ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, &amp; drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoso eat∣eth my flesh &amp; drinketh my blood hath eternal life. And the first act of faith or feeding on Christ, which is actual Conversion is signifyed as well <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after acts of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="43" REF="001433_0049_0FB2F08FE10717E8"/>
2. Argument, <HI>That Sacrament that by the institution of it presupposeth those that reep the benefits of it to be Converts, is no Conventing Ordinance: But this Sacrament of the Supper presupposeth by the Institution, those that reap the benefits of it to be Converts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I deny the minor. The Sacra∣ment by the Institution of it supposes them to be such as the Church is bound to ad∣mit. <HI>viz.</HI> Visible Saints. If God have ap∣pointed his Church to admit visible Saints, whether they be real Saints or not; we cannot say that they are by Institution supposed to be real Saints: Men may sup∣pose what they will, but by Institution they are supposed to be visible Saints.</P>
<P N="3">3. Argument, <HI>The word is the only Instru∣ment to beget Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If he intends the Preaching of the Word, both parts will fall under con∣demnation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Consequence is denyed. Be∣cause there is the Preaching the word in the Lords Supper: there the Gospel is Published, that Christs blood is shed for the remission of Sins: there is an offer of Christ cruci∣fyed: Christ may be Preached, though there is not a discourse of an hour upon a Text.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="44" REF="001433_0050_0FB2F0981E014E10"/>
2. The minor is denyed. Miracles are a means to beget faith. 1 Cor. 14.22. <HI>Tongues are for a sign to them that believe not.</HI> Prayer is a means, Joh. 4.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. <HI>Thou wouldest have asked him and he would have given thee liv∣ing waters.</HI> So is Meditation, Psal. 45.10. <HI>Hearken O daughter, and consider, for sake thine own People, and thy Fathers house.</HI> So Cir∣cumcision, the Passover and Baptism.</P>
<P>Mr. Baxter's <HI>Arguments follow.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Arg. <HI>If no man is commanded or war∣ranted to receive the Sacrament without the Profession of true Faith, then not without faith it self: But no man is warranted to receive the Sacrament, without the Profession of true faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. If he means that no man is war∣ranted to receive the Sacrament, unless he affirms that he has Saving Faith. I de∣ny the minor: For then no man might come, but he that has Assurance. And a great many gracious men must be ex∣cluded from the Sacrament.</P>
<P N="2">2. If he means that no man is warran∣ted to receive the Sacrament, unless he professes real faith. I deny the Conse∣quence: He would prove his consequence, <HI>because no man is bound to make a false: Profes∣sion.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Answer it is the duty of a man that is rationally convinced of the truth
<PB N="45" REF="001433_0051_0FB2F09B61114D30"/>of the Gospel to affirm that he believes it, tho' he doth not believe it with a Saving faith. They were blamed for not doing of it: Joh. 12.42, 43. <HI>Among the chief Ru∣lers many believed on him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the Synagogue, for they loved the praise of men more then the praise of God.</HI> When such profess faith, they make a true Profession, they profess that which they do indeed believe, though their profession be not graciously sincere, &amp; men are bound to speak the truth, though they only do it with a moral, and not with a gracious sincerity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Arg. <HI>If no Commandments that are pro∣duced in the Scripture will warrant men to re∣ceive the Sacrament without Saving faith, then no man may receive the Sacrament with∣out Saving Faith: but none are produced in the Scripture.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The minor is denyed. He proves it two ways. 1. <HI>They were not Commanded to be circumcised, whether they did consent to the Covenant or not. Ans.</HI> That is a great mistake, Children were not capable to con∣sent. 2. <HI>The Parent confessed an hearty con∣sent to the Covenant, and an hearty consent to it, is Faith. Ans.</HI> If an hearty consent to
<PB N="46" REF="001433_0052_0FB2F09F69472F38"/>the Covenant be saith, yet the profession of an hearty consent to it, is not faith.</P>
<P>In the next place he reherses a popular discourse of Mr. <HI>Charnocks;</HI> wherein there is such a loose way of arguing, that it is hardly worth the while to put Pen to Pa∣per to answer the arguments.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Charnocks</HI> arguments are of two sorts; the first sort are to prove that Un∣regenerate Persons may not come to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="1">1. Arg. <HI>The Lords Supper is Childrens bread. Ans.</HI> If so then it does belong to the visible People of God, whether they be Regenerate or no. Deut. 14.1. <HI>Ye were the Children of the Lord your God.</HI> Isa. 1.2. <HI>I have brought up Children.</HI> Jer. 3.14. <HI>Turn O backsliding Children.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Arg. <HI>For Unregenerate Persons to come to the Lords Supper is a mocking of God.</HI> Ans. It is no more a mocking of God than for such Persons to pray; by this argument they may not Pray.</P>
<P N="3">3. Arg. <HI>An Unregenerate man is not in Covenant with God, because he has no faith, which is the condition of the Covenant, therefore has no right to the Seal of the Covenant.</HI> Answ. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. By this argument <HI>Ishmael</HI> had no right to the Seal of the Covenant, nor many
<PB N="47" REF="001433_0053_0FB2F0A0ECBC9B30"/>of those that God commanded to be cir∣cumcised, <HI>Josn.</HI> 5.2. 2. That many Un∣regenerate men are in external Covenant. Deut. 5.2 <HI>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in </HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> therefore they have a right to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Covenant. 3. Ma∣ny Unregenerate men have a right to the offer of the internal Covenant, and so they may have a right to the Seal of it, which does Seal the truth of the Covenant, and also Seals the Spiritual and Eternal bles∣sings of the Covenant, not absolutely, but conditionally.</P>
<P N="4">4. Arg. <HI>An Unregenerate man is dead: what has a dead man to do with a feast?</HI> Ans. Those that are Spiritually dead are called upon to believe, which is a feeding upon Christ. So that they have to do with a Feast.</P>
<P N="5">5. Arg. <HI>The Sacrament is an Ordinance of inward Communion with Christ.</HI> Ans. So was the Passover, yet Unregenerate men might partake of that; and Unregenerate men when they come to the Lords Supper are capable of believing, and so having com∣munion with Christ.</P>
<P N="6">6. Arg. <HI>Freemen only have a right to the Priviledges of the city: and true Christians to the Priviledges of the Church.</HI> Ans. The
<PB N="48" REF="001433_0054_0FB2F0A34E829D68"/>Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and other Gentile Churches, <HI>Were fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the Household of God,</HI> Eph. 2.19. When he saith fellow citizens with the Saints; he means fellow citizens with the Jaws: but neither all the professing Gen∣tiles, nor all the Jews were Regenerate men.</P>
<P>The second sort of Arguments are to prove, that the Lords Supper is not a Con∣verting Ordinance.</P>
<P N="1">1. Arg. <HI>Baptism is not a Converting Ordi∣nance, much less this of the Supper.</HI> Ans. Bap∣tism is a Converting Ordinance two ways. 1. God gives Grace to the Children in this way. Some in their Infancy: thus we hope for some that dye in Childhood; some afterward. 2. The consideration of their being Baptised, is a means to help for∣ward their Conversion, by convincing, a∣wakning and incouraging of them. He would prove, that <HI>Baptism is not a Conver∣ting Ordinance, because Circumcision was to Abraham a Seal of the Righteousness of faith, which he had when he was Uncircumcised,</HI> Rom. 4.11. But tho' Abraham had faith before he was Circumcised, yet it don't follow that <HI>Ishmael</HI> had, that all his Male Servants had; and others in future times.</P>
<P N="2">2. Arg. <HI>Bread &amp; Wine are not to enloven
<PB N="49" REF="001433_0055_0FB2F0A5A1C98D28"/>a Dead man, but to nourish a living man, Christ is offered here as Spiritual food, and spiritual food supposeth a new birth.</HI> Ans. The con∣sequence is to be denyed: for these three reasons. 1. Because this Argument lyes as strong against the Passover's being a Converting Ordinance as the Lords Sup∣per. 2. Because Christ being offered as spiritual food, is a special incouragement unto the first act of faith, which is actual Conversion, if Christ offers to nourish us up to eternal life, that draws us to accept of him. 3. The Lords Supper represents Christ as the bread of Life, as he is; and then it is a Converting Ordinance. The reason is, because he is not only, a life supporting, strengthning, nourishing and increasing bread, but a life giving bread. Joh. 6.48.53. <HI>I am that bread of life, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</HI> And life is given in Conversion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Arg. <HI>Pre-examination implies that it is no Converting Ordinance.</HI> Ans. It implies no such thing, because this Examination is about discerning the nature of the Or∣dinance: about <HI>discerning the Lords body,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.29.</P>
<P N="4">4. Arg. <HI>The nature of Excommunication
<PB N="50" REF="001433_0056_0FB2F0A6EED326F0"/>shews it to be no Converting Ordinance. If it were a Converting Ordinance, the Incestuous Corinthian, should rather have been kept in the Church then cast out.</HI> Ans. 1. Though it be a Converting Ordinance, yet only to orderly Members; the censures are for the Conversion of disorderly ones, in case they be Unconverted. 2. The Argu∣ment is as strong against its being a streng∣thing Ordinance. The Corinthian if he were a godly man, as Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> suppo∣ses, had then need to be kept in the Church that his Grace might be strengthned.</P>

<HEAD>The Third BOOK. <HI>Arguments to prove that Sanctifying Grace is not necessary, in order to a lawful partaking of the Lords Supper, with a Vindication of them from the Exceptions of</HI> Mr. Mather.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ARgument. <HI>If Unsanctifyed Persons might lawfully come to the Passover, then they may lawfully partake of the Lords Supper: But they might lawfully come to the Passover.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="001433_0057_0FB2F0A8931D4B98"/>
This is evident, because the whole Con∣gregation of Israel were to keep it, and such Strangers among them as did subject themselves to Circumcision, <HI>Exod.</HI> 12.47, 48. And God threatens such Persons as neglect it, except they were Unclean or in a Jour∣ney. <HI>The man that is clean and not in a jour∣ney, &amp; forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the same Soul shall be cut off from his People,</HI> Numb. 19.13. The want of Sanctification never was alledged by any man, as a reason for forbearing the Passover. Unsanctify∣ed Jews did sin when they attended the Passover, because they did it not in a gra∣cious manner: so they did when they at∣tended any other duty of Worship, but the attending of this Ordinance was no Sin, nor ever charged on them as Sin in the Scripture: it would have been a great transgression if they had neglected it. There were many times, when there were very few godly men among them. Psal. 12.1. <HI>Help Lord for the godly man ceaseth, the faithful fail, from among the children of men.</HI> Isai 53.1. <HI>Who birth believed our report &amp; to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed.</HI> Yet the Passover was to be attended by the whole Congregation of Israel: there was no restriction laid upon them in <HI>Hezekiah's</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="001433_0058_0FB2F0AC25071870"/>time, or <HI>Josiah's</HI> time, and their practice is spoken of as matter of commendation.</P>
<P>The consequence is likewise good. If the want of Sanctification, did not make it unlawful for men to come to the Pass∣over: Then it don't make it unlawful for men to come to the Lords Supper. The Passover is a Sacrament as well as the Lords Supper, therefore <HI>Christ is called our Passo∣ver,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.7. <HI>Christ our Passover is Sacrifi∣ced or us.</HI> In the Passover Christ is re∣presented, and it is as well as Circumci∣sion a Seal of the righteousness of faith. If it be unlawful for Unsanctifyed persons to partake of the Lords Supper, because that is a sign of Christ Crucifyed, it would on the same account have been unlawful to have partook of the Passover, for that likewise was a sign of Christ Crucifyed. If it were unlawful, because it is an holy Ordinance; then they might not have come to the Passover, for that was an holy Ordinance also. If it be unlawful because therein Saints have communion with Christ, it would upon the same account have been unlawful to have come to the Passover; for Saints therein had commu∣nion with Christ. If it were unlawful, because the Sacrament of the Lords Sup∣per
<PB N="53" REF="001433_0059_0FB2F0B2458C9BC8"/>is a Sacrament of confirmation, then it would have been unlawful to have per∣took of the Passover, on the same account: the Passover &amp; the Lords Supper are like figures, one of Christ to come, the other of Christ already come: and when Christ abolished one, he instituted the other in the room thereof. It seems to me that many Persons do make an idol of the Lords Supper; crying it up above all Ordinances both of the Old &amp; New Testament, as if it were as peculiar to Saints as heavenly glory, and to be attend∣ed with more reverence than all other Or∣dinances. It may be this is some of the relicks of Popish Idolatry, in making the Bread &amp; Wine to be the natural Body &amp; Blood of Christ. They do by the Lords Supper as some men do by the Name of Jesus, they bow to that, but not to the Name of Christ, or God, or the Holy Ghost. So these Persons have a greater reverence for this than any other holy Ordinance. It concerns them to see that there be no Superstition in it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> makes three exceptions a∣gainst this Argument.</P>
<P N="1">1. Exception. <HI>That the Church of the Jews was National: &amp; the Church now is Congre∣gational:</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="001433_0060_0FB2F0B5885938E8"/>and he depends on Dr. <HI>Goodwin</HI> to make it good.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> There is no opposition between the Churches being National &amp; yet Congre∣gational. The whole Nation may be a National Church, and the several Congre∣gations may be Congregational Churches, as the several Synagogues of the Jews were.</P>
<P>The reason why we have no account of any National Church among the Gentiles, is because there was no Nation Converted to the Christian saith, during that time; which we have the History of, in the New Testament: there were a few in one City and a few in another that did receive the Christian faith: but the bulk of the several Nations lay in their heathenism.</P>
<P>At the Jews were a National Church of old, so when they return, they will be a National Church again, and as they will be a National Church, so Gentile Nations that profess the true Religion, are Natio∣nal Churches. His objection that then there must be an High Priest is frivolous. If he had argued that then there must be a National Church Government, he had argued right; because Israel was a Natio∣nal Church they had an Ecclesiastical <HI>Sane∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rim,</HI> but they had an High-Priest on a∣nother
<PB N="55" REF="001433_0061_0FB2F0B6B7DE4EA0"/>account, <HI>viz</HI> to typify Christ as the High-Priest of our Profession.</P>
<P>A Nation that is in Covenant with God is a National Church, a Nation that are in Covenant with God are the People of God, bound jointly and severally to keep Covenant with him. God is one party in the Covenant, and they are the other, and being bound together to keep Covenant, the whole must have power over the parts, to rectify all Mal-administrations, and to see the Covenant kept: it need not seem strange to any to hear of a National Church in the time of the New-Testament, consi∣dering how it was foretold by Isaiah: <HI>Isai.</HI> 19.24, 25. <HI>In that day Israel shall be the third with Egypt, and with Assyria, whom the, Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, blessed be Egypt my People, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.</HI> And how it was fore∣told by Christ: <HI>Matt.</HI> 13.33. <HI>The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of Meal till the whole was leavened.</HI> Though few entertain the Gospel at first, yet the whole Country in a while are brought to entertain it. What is a National Church but a Professing Na∣tion jointly bound to keep Covenant with God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="56" REF="001433_0062_0FB2F0B8E8EA6550"/>
2. Exception. <HI>Though Gospel mysteries were typifyed by the Possover, yet it was insti∣tuted in special, to be a commemoration of the deliverance out of Egypt, and so the whole Na∣tion were to partake of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> If when he saith, it was in special to be a commemoration of the deliverance out of Egypt, he intends no more. 1. Then this, that beside its typifying Gospel myste∣ries, it had a particular respect to the de∣liverance out of Egypt; there is no force at all in the exception, if it had some res∣pect to that, that hindred not the Sacred∣ness of the Ordinance, neither could it be a reason why Unsanctifyed persons should come to that Ordinance, more than to any now in the time of the New-Testa∣ment; the respect is had to the deliverance out of Egypt, does not destroy the respect it had to the Redemption by Christ: its being a Memorial of the deliverance from Egypt, don't hinder it from being a Seal of the righteousness of faith, nor make it fit to be attended by such as may not at∣tend the Lords Supper. 2. If when he saith, it was in special to be a commemo∣ration of the deliverance from Egypt, he means that it was especially, or principal∣ly instituted for that end, to be a Memo∣rial
<PB N="57" REF="001433_0063_0FB2F0BB2D73F4B0"/>of that deliverance from Egypt; surely he did not Write those words in cold blood: the deliverance out of Egypt was a great Mercy, but small in compari∣son of the deliverance by Christ: if the great thing was to be a Memorial of the deliverance from Egypt, why was there not such another Ordinance instituted, when they were delivered from Babylon; if that were the great thing why was it abo∣lished after Christs suffering? can it enter into any mans heart, to think that the ty∣pifying the Redemption by Christ was only a thing by the by in this institution? is that deliverance from Egpyt the prin∣cipal thing intended in the preface to the ten Commandments? <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. Exception. <HI>That Scandalous Persons might come to the Passover but not to the Lords Supper.</HI> He saith, <HI>Adulterers, Thieves, Liars, Slanderers, Perjured persons, might come to the Passover, and I must admit such Scandalous persons to the Lords Supper, or let go my argu∣ment from the Passover.</HI></P>
<P>And he teaches me what to answer, <HI>viz. That more positive fruits of Regeneration are required in the Church Members of the New Testament than the Old.</HI> But I dare not give that answer, because of the absurdity of it:
<PB N="58" REF="001433_0064_0FB2F0BD842BBBD8"/>for the persons, that he speaks of wanted the Negative fruits of Regeneration, and were not able to say, as the Pharisee: Luk. 18.11. <HI>God I thank thee I am not as other men are Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers, or even as this Publican.</HI></P>
<P>But this I answer, that he does greatly reproach the Church of Israel: he pre∣tends to endeavour the purity of Gospel Churches, but obtrudes that upon us which is crude and indigested, as if all sorts of vile persons might according to divine Institu∣tion, live in communion with the Jewish Church: as if the Church of Israel were like Babylon a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. I know there were great corruptions many times among them, but surely visible Saints were always <HI>de jure,</HI> the matter of Church Members: So Israel are often called: Deut. 33.3. <HI>All his Saints are in his hands:</HI> So David calls them: Psal. 111.1. <HI>I will praise thee in the Assembly of the Upright and in the Congregation.</HI> And he teaches us, <HI>That holiness becomes Gods House for ever,</HI> Psal. 93.5. And not only as Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> saith, in the time of the New Testament.</P>
<P>God appointed in the Church of Israel a way for the removal of Scandals. For,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="59" REF="001433_0065_0FB2F0BEF299DF68"/>
1. Men were required in case of Sin to offer up their Sacrifices: as is abundant∣ly evident from the Law of Moses. Lev. 6.6, 7. <HI>He shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, and the Priest shall make attonement for him before the Lord, and it shall be forgiven him.</HI> This offering of Sacrifice was to be attended with confession. Lev. 5.5. <HI>He shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing, &amp; he shall bring his trespass-offering unto the Lord for his sin.</HI> Numb. 5.6, 7. <HI>When a man or wo∣man commit any sin, that men commit, then they shall confess their sin that they have done.</HI> Hereby the Scandal was removed: there were to be visible signs of Repentance, as now are required among us.</P>
<P N="2">2. In case of obstinacy they had their way to purge the Church: they had their Ecclesiastical censures, according to di∣vine Institution. Which as Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> calls them, were an authoritative Exclusion of them, from the Society of the Church and the Members of it. The Jews do distin∣guish these censures into three degree, the first they call <HI>Niddui,</HI> the second <HI>Cherem,</HI> the third <HI>Shammatha.</HI> The Jews in Christs time did agree, that if any <HI>confessed Christ, they would put him out of the Synagogue,</HI> Joh. 9.22. This was executed on the blind man,
<PB N="60" REF="001433_0066_0FB2F0C143FBE1D8"/><HI>v</HI> 24. And it is very probable that when it is said in the Old Testament, that ob∣stinate offenders shall be cut off from a∣mong their People, that this is at least sometimes intended by it.</P>
<P N="3">3. When Persons were under the second censure, which they call <HI>Cherem,</HI> they were not to eat the Passover, they did allow them that were under the first to come in∣to the Temple, though at a distinct gate, which they called the gate of Mour∣ners, but in the second they were exclu∣ded: they agreed in Ezra's time, <HI>That those that did not assemble within three days, should be separated from the Congregation,</HI> Ezra 10.8. Then they were looked on as Heathens, according to that, Math. 18.17. <HI>If he neg∣lect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a Publican:</HI> which was no new rule appropriated to the Gospel Church, which was not in being, when Christ spake these words, but Christ did herein revive an old rule that had been always in force.</P>
<P N="2">2. Argument. <HI>If no Unsanctifyed Person may come to the Lords Supper, than no man may come, but be that knows himself to be Sanctifyed: But persons may come, that do not know themselves to be Sanctifyed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="001433_0067_0FB2F0C36ADA69C8"/>
The minor is granted. Mr. <HI>M.</HI> grants that there is no necessity of Assurance: and that if Persons search and have a pro∣bable hope that they are Converted, they may come. <HI>p.</HI> 84.</P>
<P>The consequence is plain: because up∣on that supposition, That Sanctifyed per∣sons only must come; he that don't know his Sanctification, doth not know that he hath any right to come: and so he can∣not eat in faith, and therefore Sins in com∣ing. Thus the Apostle determines the case about eating of flesh: that those that doubted whether God allowed them to do it and yet did it, were guilty: Rom. 14.23. <HI>He that doubteth is damned if he eat: be∣cause he eateth not of faith, for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</HI> He that doth not know that he is Sanctifyed, doth not by that doctrine know that he hath any right to come: he is ignorant that he hath any warrant to come: if he comes, he comes upon his peril of eating and drinking damnation to himself: if he comes he takes a liberty to do that, that he doth not know, that God gives him a liberty to do: it is horrible presumption for him to come; if all un∣sanctifyed persons are forbidden, then he doth not know but that it is forbidden
<PB N="62" REF="001433_0068_0FB2F0CF4F064C58"/>fruit to him, and that he rebels in coming: he that doth that, which he doth not know he may lawfully do, will not be ac∣cepted in it: Conscience may say to him, What right have you to it, Who gave you leave, What Warrant have you to do it? If Churches are to censure only Scanda∣lous persons, then they must know they are Scandalous before they do censure them; it is not enough for them to say they don't know but that they are, or they think that they are. If a man has a liberty to Sell only his own Horse, and not another mans, then he must know it to be his own and not another mans; and it is not enough for him to say, He did not know but it was his own, or he thought it was his own. If a Minister has a liber∣ty to Preach nothing but the truth, then he must know it to be the truth before he Preaches it; it is not enough for him to say, he did not know but it was, or that he hoped it was. Thus it is in this case. If only Sanctification gives him a real right to the Lords Supper, then nothing short of the knowledge of Sanctification can give him a known right to it: until he knows his Sanctification he is ignorant of his right: if Sanctification only gives him a
<PB N="63" REF="001433_0069_0FB2F0D3173928F0"/>right, then if he doth not know his San∣ctification, he doth not know, that he hath a right. Probable hopes wont Warrant him to come: for they don't give him a right, it is only Sanctification doth that, neither do they evidence that he hath a right.</P>
<P>But though the truth of this Argument be as evident as the light of the Sun at Noon day, yet it would be strange if Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> should have no answer to give. <HI>He tells us if after serious Examination, be can∣not but hope there is a good work begun in his Soul, be ought to come, though his hopes be not Assurance.</HI></P>
<P>But I say, he ought not to come unless he has a right to come; ought he to come if he have this hope, whether he be Re∣generate or not? he may have these hopes, and yet be unsanctifyed, then it is not San∣ctification that gives him the right but the hopes of it: he ought to come, Mr. <HI>M.</HI> saith: yet he ought to stay away because he is unsanctifyed: he is charged to come because of his hopes, and condemned for coming because he is unsanctifyed.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> labours to give relief to Wounded Consciences by a comparison, he tells, <HI>If a Jew after he had searched for
<PB N="64" REF="001433_0070_0FB2F0D4057AC560"/>leaven in the house, found none, be was to eat the Passover; so if Christians after self Exa∣mination, cannot find that they are in a state of Hypocrisy, which is leaven, they ought to come to the Lords Table.</HI> Here is a shadow with∣out substance, a comparison without a similitude. The Jew searches for leaven, he finds bread and is at a loss whether it be leavened or no; may he eat the Passo∣ver without removing that bread; so the Christian searches his heart, and finds a great deal of hypocrisy, but is at a loss whether it be reigning hypocrisy or no: ought he in this case to run the venture and come to the Lords Table?</P>
<P>The case with these men that don't know their Saint-ship, is like the case of the Priests that could not find their Re∣gister, Ezra 2.62, 63. <HI>They were put from the Priest-bood as Polluted, that they should not eat of the holy things, till there stood up a Priest with Urim and Thummim.</HI> So these that cannot find their Saint-ship must forbear eating at the Lords Table, till they can make it out, if it be Sanctification that gives a right to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P>There is a strange inconsistency in his doctrine, sometimes he teaches that Re∣generation gives the right to come, and
<PB N="65" REF="001433_0071_0FB2F0D6DD96C0B8"/>that unsanctifyed persons may not come; sometimes that if they hope after Exami∣nation that they are godly, then they may come. But if it be grace only that gives them a right, then preponderating hopes of Grace will not give them a right; be∣sides if an hope that they are godly gives them a right, then that which is very sin∣ful will give them a right: for such are the hopes of many men, founded in Pride and Ignorance: <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleansed from their filthiness,</HI> Prov. 30.12. Again, if a probable hope gives men a right, then when ever they have a preponderating fear that they are not godly, they must forbear, and so neglect the means of their consolation. Again, if a preponderating hope gives them a right: then some have a right to the Lords Supper, that are worse than some that know themselves to be Unconverted: some conceited senceless men nourish such an hope: and some that are very near to the Kingdom of God, be∣ing humbled and prepared for Christ know themselves to the Unconverted.</P>
<P N="3">3. Argument. <HI>Those that are Members of the Church and neither ignorant nor scandalous may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, but some
<PB N="66" REF="001433_0072_0FB2F0D80EF90200"/>Unsanctifred persons are Members of the Church and neither ignorant nor scandalous.</HI></P>
<P>The major doth appear, from the in∣stitution of Christ, this is his command to his Church. When Christ instituted the Supper, he appointed it to be an Ordi∣nance for Disciples to the end of the World, when he said, <HI>This do in remembrance of me,</HI> Luk. 22.19. It doth not only in∣tend the duty of the Apostles at that time, but that they and their successours should attend that Service in all Generations. Therefore this command is inforced on the Church of Corinth by the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.24, 25. This is one special way wherein the Church doth give a testimony unto Christ, celebrate the Memory of his death, and shew it forth: <HI>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye shew forth the Lords death till he come.</HI></P>
<P>This is also evident from the practice of the Apostles, and primitive Church, those that were added to the Church continu∣ed in this practice. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.42. So the <HI>Disciples came together on the Lords day to break bread,</HI> Acts 20.7. This was the man∣ner also of the Church of Corinth: there were not a Number of them that neglected, because unsanctifyed, but they all partook.
<PB N="67" REF="001433_0073_0FB2F0DCB3CFA048"/>1 Cor. 10 17. <HI>We being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread:</HI> 1 Cor. 12.13. <HI>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is also evident. That some Unsanctifyed men are Members of the Church. The foolish Virgins did belong unto the Kingdom of God, as well as the wise, Mat. 25.1, 2. <HI>The Kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten Virgins which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom, and five of them were wise, and five were fool∣ish.</HI> Multitudes that are in fellowship with Churches are destitute of Saving Grace. Among the many that are called sew are chosen, <HI>Math.</HI> 20.16. Our Reve∣rend Author does acknowledge this, but he faith, <HI>They are not duly qualifyed to be Members of Churches.</HI> But this is utterly in∣consistent with what he faith in other pla∣ces. For he doth again &amp; again acknow∣ledge that the Churches ought to admit those that are Saints to rational Charity, though they be Unregenerate; and like∣wise he doth acknowledge, that if after <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Examination, a person cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that there is a good Work begun in
<PB N="68" REF="001433_0074_0FB2F0DDA94B2EA8"/>his Soul, he ought to come. And by these two rules many that are destitute of Grace ought to be admitted into Churches, God does appoint them to come and God does appoint Churches to accept of them; so that according to divine institution they are Members of Churches, and qualifyed according to Gods Ordinance for it.</P>
<P>For the further clearing that some Un∣sanctifyed persons are Members of the Church. Let it be considered, that many of these persons were born in the Church, and therefore Baptized in their Infancy, and have been all their days bred up in the Church, and never gave any just occasi∣on to be cast out of the Church: so that they have their standing there, and are regular Members of the Church.</P>
<P>I foresee that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> will object a∣gainst this, from his digression, <HI>p.</HI> 20, 21. <HI>viz.</HI> That these persons do belong to the visi∣ble Catholick, but not to any particular instituted Church, and he has Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> for his voucher.</P>
<P>But this will not bear Examination; it is as if he should say, That the Children of the Town, were Members of Mankind, and Members of the Common Wealth, but not Members of the Town where they
<PB N="69" REF="001433_0075_0FB2F0E008DFA6F8"/>dwell: Is it agreable to reason to think that the Church stands in relation to them, and is bound to see to their Education, and that they stand in no relation to the Church? How unreasonable is it to think, that a Multitude of men should be reckoned of the Common Wealth of Isra∣el, and have some Priviledges for them∣selves and Children, and yet be under no Ecclesiastical Government? is not this quite contrary to the practice of these Churches, who have been wont to call many to account for their Misdemenours, who were the Children of the Church?</P>
<P>What do these men want to make them Members of particular Churches? he will say, <HI>They want to be in Covenant with parti∣cular Churches;</HI> but there is neither Pre∣cept nor PRecedent for it in the Scripture. He faith in another Book, That I call the Church a body corporate; but there is no forming of a body corporate without a Covenant; but therein he lies under a great mistake; bodies corporate may be made by Law, and they may be made by Charter.</P>
<P>There is a covenant indeed between God and every professing Nation. God brought his people of old into a Church
<PB N="70" REF="001433_0076_0FB2F0E16E26E548"/>Estate by making a covenant with them, which covenant was several times renew∣ed, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.10-13. And all Proselytes a∣mong the Jews were to take hold of this covenant: <HI>Isai.</HI> 56.4. But there is no necessity of any covenant between the Members of a particular Congregation among themselves, though God makes Promises to a National Church, it does not follow, that the Members of a Congre∣gation must make Promises among them∣selves. There was a covenant between God and the Church of Israel: but the Members of each Synagogue did not make a covenant between themselves: Parti∣cular Churches may be bounded either by civil Authority, or Ecclesiastical, or by Argument: and it is ordinarily the duty of every one that is a Member of the Ca∣tholick Church, to carry on the Worship of God in conjunction with the particular Church where he dwells: and he is bound by his profession of Religion so to do, and the Church likewise doth stand bound to accept of him, if he carries well.</P>
<P N="4">4. Argument <HI>If the Lords Supper be in∣stituted for Conversion of Sinners as well as for the Edification of Saints, then Sanctifying Grace is not necessary to mens attending of it: But it as Instituted for the Conversion of Sinners: not
<PB N="71" REF="001433_0077_0FB2F0E354F985A8"/>for the Conversion of Heathens to the Christian Religion, but for the Saving Conversion of Professing men.</HI></P>
<P>The minor which is only in question, may be confirmed by these considerations.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Ordinance has a proper ten∣dency to promote mens Conversion. Con∣version taken largly, as it comprehends preparatory Work, consists of three parts, &amp; this Ordinance is serviceable to them all.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Conviction.</HI> Men must be convinced of the anger of God because of their Sins, and the necessity of being at Peace with him: and this Ordinance is a means to settle this conviction on the heart: for here is a discovery of the terrible anger of God for sin, by the inflicting of the curse upon Christ, when sin was but imputed unto him; a man may well reason thus, <HI>If this be done to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Humiliation.</HI> Or the bringing of the Sinner off from his own Righteousness: for in this Ordinance God teaches men, the necessity of Christs righteousness, that their own is but husks, and will not nou∣rish them up unto eternal Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Faith.</HI> Christ is here offered to men, and the call makes way for the answer of
<PB N="72" REF="001433_0078_0FB2F0E707BC4920"/>the Soul; here is an affecting represen∣tation of the dying love of Christ, which serves to remove many discouragements, and of the accursed death of Christ, where∣in the Sinner may see Satisfaction made for sin. In this Ordinance the truth of the covenant is Sealed, which is a great means to beget in the Soul a perswasion of the cruth of it. And if the man be but convinced of these things he is gained: those that understand any thing of the working of Gods Spirit on the heart, must be sensible that it hath a great tendency to advance Conversion; &amp; why has God given it such a tendency to promote Conversion, if it were not appointed for that end.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some that are Unsanctifyed ought to offer themselves to communion in the Lords Supper, and that on a double account; <HI>1st.</HI> Because they are in cove∣nant with God, and therefore being nei∣ther ignorant nor of bad conversation, the Seal of the covenant doth belong to them. Many of them were born in covenant and have actually renewed the covenant, and therefore ought to tender themselves to communion, they ought to receive Gods confirmation of his covenant, and to use
<PB N="73" REF="001433_0079_0FB2F0E9C934DF60"/>the means to stir them up to keep cove∣nant. <HI>2ly.</HI> Because it is a scandal if they do not, and the Church may call them to an account for their neglect. It is a visible contempt cast upon the Ordinance, it is a denyal of the Gospel, and a refusal to shew forth the death of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Church by the Ordinance of God is bound to admit many Unconverted persons to the Lords-Supper, they are Ecclesiastically qualifyed having know∣ledge and a good conversation; they are Saints to a judgment of Charity, walking orderly; and therefore the Church is to accept them into their communion; the Church is to act upon what is visible, so that according to the Ordinance of God they are to be received to communion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Lords Supper is for the Spiritual good of all that are regularly to be admit∣ted thereunto. All Ordinances attended according to institution, are for that end, that the Spirit may be Saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, and so this Ordinance. This is the Work of the Ministry in all their administrations, by all means to save some. This Ordinance may have a contrary ef∣fect, &amp; be an occasion of the ruin of softie: but the direct end of it is Salvation, and
<PB N="74" REF="001433_0080_0FB2F0ED52801D50"/>so the direct end of it is Conversion, when the Subject that it is administred unto stands in need of Conversion: there is no reason to confine the benefit of it unto Saints.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> argues, That <HI>Faith comes by Hearing,</HI> Rom. 14. Why does he not argue that the Subsequent acts of faith come by hearing as well as the first, and that there∣fore the Lords Supper is not for the strengthning of Faith. Put indeed there is Hearing, as well as Seeing, and Touch∣ing and Smelling and Tasting, in the Sa∣crament of the Supper, there is a gracious offer of Christ, and all his benefits, which has a proper tendency to beget faith.</P>
<P N="5">5. Argument. <HI>If the Lords Supper be only for Converted men, then God would have given some certain rule in the attending of which it might be restrained to Converted men: but he hath given no such rule in attending of which it may be restrained to Converted men.</HI></P>
<P>The major is evident, because if it be appointed only for Converted men, and no rule given whereby it may be restrain∣ed to them, then his Law would be im∣practicable. The law would be a meer snare, and men would be under a necessi∣ty to prophane his Ordinance: it is a re∣flection
<PB N="75" REF="001433_0081_0FB2F0EFA6C1DC18"/>on the Wisdom and Holiness of God to impute such a thing to him. God don't bind his Church to impossibilities, if he had made any such Ordinance, he would give gifts to his Church to distinguish Sincere men from Hypocrites, whereby the Ordinance might have been attended.</P>
<P>The minor is also evident: He has given no such rule to his Church, where∣by it may be restrained to converted Men. This appears because by the rule, that they are to go by, they are allowed to give the Lords Supper to many Unconverted men: for all visible Signs are common to men converted and unconverted. If they go by profession of the truth, that is com∣mon to both; if by a good Conversation, that is common to both; if by zeal in Re∣ligion, that is common to both; if by suf∣fering in the cause of God, that is common to both; if by knowledge, that is common to both; if by a relation of Experiences, that is common to both.</P>
<P>Obj <HI>There is a certain rule given whereby godly men may knew their godliness, &amp; that they are Warranted to come to the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> will not stand by that rule: for he saith, <HI>That if after serious self Examination, a man cannot but hope that
<PB N="76" REF="001433_0082_0FB2F0F150230EC8"/>he is a godly man, he may come though be hath not Assurance:</HI> And if he goes by Mr. <HI>Ma∣ther's</HI> rule, that will not restrain the Sa∣crament to converted men. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> pretends to give a solution of this argu∣ment, by propounding another Objection for me to answer. He saith, <HI>That I main∣tain that only Orthodox Christians may come to the Lords Supper;</HI> and then there must be a certain rule to know the inward Sen∣timents of mens hearts: but he mistakes the matter very much; I only hold that men must be Orthodox in their Profession. Churches are to judge concerning visible Saint-ship, when they go higher they go beyond their Sphere.</P>
<P>He saith, <HI>why should we not believe that men that give us an account of their Con∣version, and whose Conversations are outwardly blameless and holy, are really according as they seem to be.</HI> I will give him a reason, and that is because it may be false; Ma∣ny persons that have given a fair account and carried well in the eye of the World for several years, have not proved well at last: and God obliges no man to believe that which may be false.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="77" REF="001433_0083_0FB2F0F2B4E74238"/>
6. Argument. <HI>If Unsanctifyed men may attend all other Ordinances or Duties of Wor∣ship, then they may lawfully attend the Lords Supper: But they may attend all other Ordi∣nances or Duties of Worship.</HI></P>
<P>The minor will be generally acknow∣ledged: And indeed there was not any duty of Worship required since the foun∣dation of the World, that they might not attend. But Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> doth object: he grants that an Unconverted man may Preach: for he may have great gifts which he may and ought to improve to the glory of God, and the good of men. But he thinks he may not administer the Lords Supper; he saith, <HI>The argument from Natural to Instituted Worship will not hold.</HI> But he strangly forgets himself; might not the Priests of old though unregenerate attend other duties of their Office as well as Preach the word; Sacrificing was In∣stituted Worship as well as administring the Lords Supper, so was offering of In∣cense: but where were they forbidden to do those Services, in case they were Unrege∣nerate? the blessing of administrations in the house of God doth not depend upon the Piety of the Minister. The Officia∣ting
<PB N="78" REF="001433_0084_0FB2F0F491C2E000"/>as Priests of old did depend upon Na∣tural Generation, and not upon Regene∣ration: Unregeneracy did not give them a discharge from the work of their Office.</P>
<P>The consequence may be made evi∣dent from hence, because there can be no reason assigned, why Unsanctifyed persons may attend all other duties of Worship and not the Lords Supper. If there be the like reason for them to for∣bear other duties of Worship as to forbear this, and the like reason to attend this act of Worship as others, then the lawful∣ness of attending them, shews the lawful∣ness of attending this: if it were made out to be Gods pleasure that it should be so that is reason enough: but there is no reason can be assigned for such a dis∣ference.</P>
<P>Particularly: It can be no reason for Unregenerate men to forbear the Lords Supper because it is an holy Ordinance: For all the Ordinances of God are holy. Circumcision was so, and the Passover, so is Baptism: these Ordinances were ap∣pointed for the advancing of Holiness, there was Religion in them, they were to be attended in an holy manner, and it was great Wickedness to use them in a
<PB N="79" REF="001433_0085_0FB2F0F8346F5AE8"/>prophane way; they were designed for the honour of God, yet that was no suffi∣cient reason for Unregenerate men to forbear attending of them: and therefore that can be no sufficient reason to forbear attending the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lords Supper being a Sacra∣ment or Seal of the Covenant can be no reason. Two of Mr. <HI>Gillespy</HI>'s arguments are built upon that foundation; but if that arguing were good, Unregenerate persons must be forbidden all Sacraments. <HI>Circumcision was a Seal of the Righteousness of faith, Rom.</HI> 4.11. Yet God command∣ed <HI>Joshua</HI> at <HI>Gilgal</HI> to Circumcise all the Males who were born in the Wilderness: who were several hundred thousands, <HI>Josh.</HI> 5.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. Its being a Sacrament of confirma∣tion can be no sufficient reason. For the Passover was so as well as the Lords Sup∣per; Circumcision was the initiating Sa∣crament to the Jews, and the Passover the Sacrament of confirmation: but Unrege∣nerate men might lawfully celebrate the Passover, when God first appointed it, multitudes of them were Unregenerate, as appears by their carriage in the Wilder∣ness. As this Sacrament does represent
<PB N="80" REF="001433_0086_0FB2F0FA278BCF50"/>Christ as food for the Soul, so did the Pass∣over: As in this Ordinance, Saints have communion with Christ, so they had in the Passover.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is no sufficient reason,</HI> because the Minister is to say at the administration of the Lords Supper, That <HI>this is Christs body which is given for you,</HI> and <HI>this is his blood which is shed for you:</HI> according to the Pattern: <HI>Luke</HI> 22.19,20. For these words may be spoken to Unregenerate men. As Ministers often do in their Sermons, when they call on Sinners to come to Christ, and when they reprove for sin, and urge them to duties of Obedience: those expressions do not intend that Christ did dye designedly for them, but that his death and satisfaction is offered to them, and shall be made over to them if they accept of Him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Gods not allowing Scandalous per∣sons to come to this Ordinance is no rea∣son. Some Scandalous persons indeed may be far better than Unregenerate per∣sons, yet there may be great reason for the former to be prohibited and not the latter: Scandalous persons are forbidden, partly to bring them in that way to a sight of their evil practices, partly for the
<PB N="81" REF="001433_0087_0FB2F0FDD6680DB0"/>Vindication of Gods Name, which has been dishonoured by them.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Apostles commanding men to Examine themselves as a preparation for coming to the Lords Supper, can be no rea∣son. If he had said, Let men Examine them∣selves &amp; so let them fast, we should not have thought that to be a sufficient reason for Unregenerate men to abstain from fast∣ing. And if he had said, That he that Prays unworthily, and Hears the word un∣worthily, exposes himself to Damnation or Judgment, we should not have looked upon that a sufficient reason for Unrege∣nerate men to refrain from Praying, and Hearing of the Word.</P>
<P>Were I a Papist, and did I believe the doctrine of Transubstantiation, that the Bread and Wine were the natural body and blood of Christ, I might think that to be a sufficient reason for Unregenerate mens not coming to the Lords Supper, &amp; though I do not imagine any such ap∣prehensions in those Brethren that differ from me, yet I doubt that opinion has laid the foundation of their doctrine, and likewise of recieving the Sacrament knee∣ling.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="82" REF="001433_0088_0FB2F1002EE1FBD0"/>
7. Argument. <HI>They that are in external Covenant with God, and neither Ignerant nor Scandalous may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, but some Unsanctifyed persons are in external Covenant with God.</HI></P>
<P>The minor cannot be denyed. God made a Covenant with the whole People of Israel: <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.2. They and their Posterity after them were the Covenant People of God: God stood in relation to them as their God, they stood in relation to him as his People. And so the Profes∣sing People of God now are in Covenant with him, and so are their Children, and therefore they are baptized.</P>
<P>The consequence is evident from hence. Because it is lawful for them to keep the external Covenant: as they have a natu∣ral so they have a legal power to keep the external Covenant. The attending of the Lords Supper is one of the external duties of the Covenant: Circumcision is said <HI>to be the Covenant:</HI> Gen. 17.10. <HI>This is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee, every man Child among you, shall be circumcised.</HI> And <HI>v.</HI> 14. The neglect of this is called, <HI>A break∣ing of the Covenant.</HI> So the Lords Supper
<PB N="83" REF="001433_0089_0FB2F101AF55FB20"/>is part of the Covenant, and a token of the Covenant: and if any Professing People do neglect it, be it under what notion it will, it will be a grievous breach of Covenant.</P>
<P>If God does command them to attend Covenant duties, then he don't forbid them; God does not require and prohi∣bit the same thing, there is a consistency in Gods commands: He does not lay a tye upon mens Consciences to come, and lay a tye upon their Consciences to for∣bear; God makes them promise to keep his Covenant; and will he make it criminal to attend those duties of the Covenant, which he has made them promise to keep? they cannot keep the Covenant if they don't come to the Lords Supper, therefore it must be lawful for them to come.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>It is a Covenant duty but it must not be attended by Unqualifyed Persons; though it be a Covenant duty, yet not for Ignorant Per∣sons, nor Scandalous Persons, nor Unsanctifyed Persons: if Persons be not duly qualified it is no immediate duty for them; the Ignorant must get knowledge, Scandalous persons must repent of their transgressions, and Natural men must get into a Converted condition, and so come to the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="001433_0090_0FB2F1033683E308"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> It is very reasonable to say that God requires Ignorant persons to come, and yet for bids them to come before they have knowledge; and that he requires Scandalous persons to come, and yet for∣bids their coming until they have made Satisfaction: because they are able to qualify themselves, they may truly be said to have liberty and legal power to come, because they have a natural power to qualify themselves; it is their duty to amend their fauls and so to come.</P>
<P>But it is unreasonable to say that natu∣ral men are commanded to come, and yet that they are forbidden to come till they are Sanctifyed: for their Sanctifica∣tion is a thing out of their power: the vi∣sible people of God are able to keep the external Covenant: It cannot be said to be lawful for them to keep the external Covenant, if it doth depend upon their Conversion which is indeed out of their power. But indeed there is no part of the external Covenant, that is beyond mens natural power, or their legal power.</P>
<P N="8">8. Argument. <HI>Either some Unsanctifyed Persons may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, or it is not lawful for them to carry themselves
<PB N="85" REF="001433_0091_0FB2F105A52BEE20"/>as Saints: But it is not unlawful for them to carry themselves as Soints.</HI></P>
<P>The minor doth appear: Because Pro∣fessors are commanded to carry as be∣cometh Saints: Phil. 1.27. <HI>Let your con∣versation be as becometh the Gospel of Christ.</HI> 2 Tim. 2.19. <HI>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</HI> Such as make a Profession of the Gospel, ought not to carry so as to give men occasion to sear that they are not Saints: they may not live in such a way as is unlawful for Saints to live in, in such a way as is contra∣ry to the Spirits of Saints: it is unlawful for them to bring a reproach upon their Profession; to live in such a way as is in∣consistent with the living exercise of Grace.</P>
<P>The truth of the disjunction doth ap∣pear; because when Professors do neg∣lect the Lords Supper, they do not carry themselves as Saints; for they do neglect that Ordinance that Saints are bound to attend; and they neglect that Ordinance that the Souls of Saints do crave, they do visibly deny the Gospel, they withold their Testimony from Jesus Christ, and do not shew forth the Lords death. This neglect of theirs is an unholy carriage, not
<PB N="86" REF="001433_0092_0FB2F106F4E04528"/>according to their Profession; they carry like visible Unbelievers they are called visible Saints &amp; challenge Baptism for their Children as visible Saints, and yet in this particular they carry themselves as Unbe∣lieves, and not as visible Saints.</P>
<P N="9">9. Argument. <HI>If Sanctifying Grace be necessary unto the lawful attending of the Lords Supper, then none but those that have a Saving work of Conversion, may attend it: but that is not true doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is evident from hence: That doctrine that has a direct tendency to discourage many godly Men from doing their duty, and the means of their com∣fort, and to make their attending of their duty to be a torment to them, is not ac∣cording to the Scripture. For one great design in the Scripture is to encourage godly men to do their duty: but this doctrine has quite another tendency.</P>
<P>There be many godly men, that are not assured of their Conversion: but are exercised with many fears about their Sincerity: though Grace be visible, yet several Persons that have it do not cer∣tainly know it. Grace may be so coun∣terfeited, and false hearts may go so far
<PB N="87" REF="001433_0093_0FB2F10AA08BF478"/>in Religion, that many godly men are held down with great Suspicions that they are not godly, especially at times. Hence godly men are advised <HI>to give all diligence to make their Calling &amp; Election sure,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. And this doctrine has two bad effects upon them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It makes them neglect the Lords Supper.</HI> It is their duty to attend it: it is one of the holy appointments of Jesus Christ; and we owe this Service to Christ to shew forth his Death, and give our testi∣mony before the world, to the vertue of his blood, which is an honour and glory to him; and this Service is of great con∣sequence to our selves to draw forth the actings of faith, to strengthen our com∣fort and to quicken us in a way of Obe∣dience: but several as choice Persons for godliness as any, so far as men can judge, have been so discouraged by this doctrine, that they have neglected the Lords Sup∣per; and continued at least for some time in the Omission of this Ordinance.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It makes some of them to attend it with guilt and torment.</HI> They have been urged to attend it by a fear least they should of∣fend God, and by the perswasions of men, and by considering that it would be an
<PB N="88" REF="001433_0094_0FB2F10B67FBBF90"/>occasion of reproach: and an offence to the Church, if they should not do it. Yet because of this doctrine, they have been far from Satisfaction in what they have been doing: Conscience has forbid∣den them, threatned them and condemn∣ed them for doing of it; they have set upon thorns, and had a great deal of fear and disquietment of Spirit: hereby they have been hindred from attending of it in an holy manner; Conscience has for∣bidden them to meddle with it, their thoughts has been taken up at the time, not about the virtue of Christs Death, but about their own dreadful venture in com∣ing thither: the fears of their hypocrisy have been increased by their daring to participate; that that should have been a means to comfort them, has proved an occasion of torment to them.</P>
<P>If these persons be told that this Ordi∣nance be only for Converted persons, yet if they after Serious Examination have hopes that they are Converted, they may and ought to come; That will not satis∣fy their tender Consciences: they will say, <HI>We may have such hopes and yet not be Converted: the hopes of Multitudes of men are delusions, and if our hopes should be such,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="001433_0095_0FB2F113E5C76EB8"/><HI>they will not warrant us to come, we don't find in the Scriptures, that God gives allow∣ance to men because they have hopes; we can't find that God saith we should come, if we have such hopes:</HI> the men say: <HI>We don't know but that we eat and drink Damnation to our selves: the thing that is required is Conversion, not hopes of Conversion. If God should demand of us, What makes us so bold to come, He will not accept of that for an answer, That we hoped we were Converted, if we be not indeed so, we prophane Gods Or∣dinance, and eat forbidden fruit.</HI> Fears that they are not Converted is a stronger ar∣gument to make them stay away, than hopes that they are Converted is to make them come: Tender Consciences will not be bafled with such answers.</P>
<P N="10">10. Argument. <HI>They who do convey to their Children a right to the Sacrament of Baptism, have a right themselves to the Lords Supper, provided they carry inoffensively: But some Unsanctifyed persons do convey unto their Children a right to the Sacrament of Baptism.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is evident from these two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Children of some Unsanctifyed
<PB N="90" REF="001433_0096_0FB2F115FA769550"/>persons have a right to Baptism.</HI> For the Children of all visible Believers have a right to Baptism, and among them, there be several Unsanctifyed Persons: and it has been determined by a <HI>Synod</HI> in <HI>New∣England, That the Children of those who are born in the Church, and understand the Prin∣ciples of Religion, and own the Covenant, are to be Baptized.</HI> And the generality of the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> do prac∣tice accordingly.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Parents though Unsanctifyed, do convey this right unto their Children.</HI> The Children have a right to Baptism, because they are the Children of visible Believers: the Children are Ecclesiastically holy be∣cause one at least of their Parents are vi∣sible Believers: 1 Cor. 7.14. <HI>The unbe∣lieving Husband is Sanctifyed by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is Sanctifyed by the Hus∣band, else were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</HI></P>
<P>The consequence is evident, because this shews that they are in Covanant with God. If they were not in Covenant with God, their Children would not be in Covenant, neither would they have any right to Baptism; but they are in Covenant, God has made Promises to
<PB N="91" REF="001433_0097_0FB2F11854EE0840"/>them, and they are under Covenant in∣gagements to him; and because they are in Covenant, and inoffensive in their Conversation, the Seal of the Covenant does belong to them.</P>
<P N="11">11. Argument. <HI>If the Invisible Church Catholick is not the prime and principal Sub∣ject of the Seal of the Covenant, then some Unsanctifyed persons may lawfully partake of the Lords-Supper: But the Invisible Church Catholick is not the prime and principal Subject, of the Seals of the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>The minor is laid down as a conclusi∣on by Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> in his Survey: <HI>p.</HI> 41. which he proves by several argu∣ments against Mr. <HI>Ruterford.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly he argues, Such as were graceless and without any interest in Christ, and so none of his invisible Mem∣bers, have Gods command to injoyn, and his word to warrant them, to receive the Seals; as <HI>Ishmael, Esau,</HI> and all the Males were injoyned to be Circumcised. All the Families of the Jews were command∣ed to eat the Passover, many whereof were without all question, not invisible and believing Members of Christ. He
<PB N="92" REF="001433_0098_0FB2F119CA95ABC8"/>adds, That the visible Church is the Olive spoken of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.17. The Seals are part of that fulness that appertains there∣unto: and therefore the visible Church is the prime subject of them. And he brings in Mr. <HI>Ruterford</HI> confessing that if any after they are received, shall be found Unregenerate, they are not to be cast out for that. And saith upon it. Then I suppose you will not deny them the Seals. <HI>p.</HI> 43.</P>
<P>I mention this Testimony of Mr. <HI>Hook∣ers,</HI> to shew how injuriously Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> deals with me, when he calls my Opinion, a new, upstart and singular Opinion; and the vanity of his admiration, That a Minister of <HI>New-England,</HI> should Publish such doctrine; whereas its no other than what has been Printed by one of the Pillars of the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> Sixty years before.</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> spoken half so much in the Vindication of Mr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s Opi∣nion, in probability he would have spent good part of a Page in an Encomium of him, and in urging the irrefragableness of his discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="001433_0099_0FB2F11CB5FBEA70"/>
Before I conclude, I shall take notice of two failings further in Mr. <HI>Mather's</HI> Book; one is, That he recites some sen∣tences of mine, where I Paraphrase on and illustrate my Position about the Lords∣Supper: as if they were the arguments that I brought to prove my Opinion; and then saith, Is not all this weak ar∣guing. <HI>p.</HI> 76. He has now my arguments, and his liberty to shew the weakness of them.</P>
<P>The other is, That he saith, My doctrine hath been condemned by an whole Synod of Elders and Messengers of Churches: who met in <HI>Boston</HI> in the year 1679.</P>
<P>The words of the Synod are these, <HI>It is requisite that Persons be not admitted un∣to Communion in the Lords Supper, without making a Personal and Publick Profession of their Faith and Repentance, either Orally or in some other way, to the just Satisfaction of the Church, and that therefore both Elders and Churches be duely watchful and circum∣spect in this matter.</HI></P>
<P>I shall give the World an Account how the matter was acted. Some of the Elders in the Synod had drawn up a Con∣clusion,
<PB N="94" REF="001433_0100_0FB2FBD5074C0EA8"/>That persons should make a Re∣lation of the work of Gods Spirit upon their hearts, in order to coming into full Communion. Some others of the Elders objected against it, and after some dis∣course it was agreed to have a dispute on that question, Whether those Professors of Religion as are of good Conversation, are not to be admitted to full Communi∣on, provided that they are able to Exa∣mine themselves, and discern the Lords body. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> held the Negative; I laboured to make good the Affirmative: The result was, That they blotted out that clause of Making a Relation of the work of Gods Spirit, and put in the room of it, <HI>The Making a Profession of their Faith and Repentance;</HI> and so I Voted with the Rest, and am of the same judgment still; yet this Vote is mentioned as condem∣ning my Opinion.</P>
<P>What can we suppose to be the reason, that Divines in reckoning up those bene∣fits that flow from Effectual Calling, take no notice of a right to the Lords Supper, they reckon Justification, Adoption, San∣ctification, Peace of Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost, Assurance of Gods Love, &amp;c.
<PB N="95" REF="001433_0101_0FB2FBD676DF4D60"/>But I meet with none that reckon a right to the Lords-Supper among those bene∣fits: I can give no other reason than this, That it is not accounted of by them a peculiar Priviledge of those that are Ef∣fectually Called; but the Priviledge of visible Believers: neither would Pastors of Churches satisfy their Consciences, to forbear warning of such as were convin∣ced that they were in a Natural Estate, to refrain coming to the Lords Supper, if they did judge it to be a Sinful and Dan∣gerous thing for them to come.</P>
<P>If these things which I have Written be impartially considered, it will appear that Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has not proved any mistake in the Sermon, that he has shew∣ed so much zeal against; indeed Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has in a manner given the case. (1.) By owning that the Church ought to receive Unregenerate men, provided they are Godly to rational Charity. (2.) That it is the duty of persons to come to the Lords-Supper, if after Exa∣mination they cannot but hope, that there is a good work begun in them.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="001433_0102_0FB2FBDA300A3F90"/>
I will conclude this defence, of my Self, and my Sermon against which Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has Written, with my assurance of my Brethren in the Ministry, and all good Men, That I differ from none of them in a strict Opinion of the Straight∣ness of the Gate, and Narrowness of the Way that leads to Life; nor of the Ne∣cessity of Sincere Repentance, true Faith and Obedience, to all the Command∣ments of the Gospel, in all such as Expect Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, of which the Participation in the Sacraments of the New-Testament of themselves, give no Assurance, as is evident from our Saviours answer at the Great Day to such as challenge, <HI>to have Eaten and Drank in his Presence;</HI> yet am well assured, they are the Ordinances and path of Life, in which every Christian ought to walk; and I dare not my self, as one of the Stewards in Gods House, refuse his Bread to such as regularly demand it, upon the Tearms mentioned in this small Tract, in which I am well confirmed by the Practice of so many Protestant Churches; nor am I at all Startled by
<PB N="97" REF="001433_0103_0FB2FBDBC8FAE3A0"/>any mans Opinion to the contrary. All Protestants agree that there is no Infa∣libility at <HI>Rome;</HI> and I know no body pretends to any else since the Apostles days; nor do I fear the Athenian accusa∣tion of Novelty any more than the great Apostle, and because we must all answer for our selves to our Great Master, I am contented, and hope I live dayly in a Preparation for that Account. In the mean time, I will carry it as I ought to all good men of another Opinion, least I be found beginning to beat my Fellow-Servant, when my Lord shall come; being well assured, That if a strict discipline be maintained in the Churches of Christ, all Unworthy Com∣municants will be far more easily con∣vinced and reformed, than if I should re∣fuse them what is their just due, and thereby Scandalize them, to their Offence, and it may be to their Ruin.</P>
<P>The first Reformers of the Church from Popery proceeded well, but we stayed not with <HI>Luther,</HI> since which the Protestant Churches have gone further; and I hope <HI>New-England,</HI> has done something more
<PB N="98" REF="001433_0104_0FB2FBDDF1A1A488"/>than most: but I should be very vain to think there must be nothing left for us of this Generation, and am very fearful least the Neglect of a good Government of all Gods People, born within the Pale of the Church, should bring these Churches to a great defection; the means to prevent which, is not to deny them their right at the Lords Table, but to give them that, and a good and strict Watch over their Lives and Manners, together with it; which I Pray to God may be never wanting in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
