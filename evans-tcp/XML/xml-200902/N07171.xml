<L>With light-wing'd FANCY thro' th'Elysian Way:</L>
<L>Whether it chance to please the youthful Queen,</L>
<L>With airy Step to grace the rural Scene;</L>
<L N="5">Or softly languish thro' the breezy Grove,</L>
<L>In all the dying tenderness of Love;</L>
<L>Or, <HI>Moon-light</HI> wandring by the Surf-beat Shoar,</L>

<L N="10">And dip her Plumage in the dewy Skies;</L>
<L>Once more propitious to my Pray'r attend!</L>
<L>Once more, CELESTIAL MUSE! thy Influence lend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FAIR SCIENCE softning, with reforming Hand,</L>
<L>The native Rudeness of a barbarous Land;</L>
<L N="15">Her radiant Throne, uprais'd by Pow'r divine;</L>
<L>Her numerous Sons low bending at her Shrine</L>
<L>I sing—Oh could my artless Numbers seem</L>
<L>To flow inspir'd, and equal to my Theme!</L>

<L>YE Friends of <HI>Learning</HI> patronize my Song,</L>
<L N="20">To <HI>You</HI> the tributary Strains belong.</L>
<L>But chiefly THOU, beneath whose gentle Sway</L>
<L>The Muse delights to swell the pleasing Lay;</L>
<L>Glad <HI>Science</HI> THEE shall her MAECENAS hail,</L>
<L><HI>Wisdom</HI> shall smile, and heav'nly <HI>Truth</HI> prevail.</L>

<L N="25">IN yonder Dome—it boasts no pompous Name,</L>
<L>Yet not the less shall swell the Page of Fame—</L>
<L>In yonder Dome, with modest Beauty crown'd,</L>
<L>Whose sober Walls it's ample Area bound,</L>
<L>Bright <HI>Sicence</HI> dwells—how honour'd the Retreat</L>
<L N="30">Where <HI>Science</HI> deigns to fix her fav'rite Seat!</L>
<L>High from her Throne she beams celestial Day,</L>
<L>And distant Lands confess th'enliv'ning Ray:</L>
<L>The <HI>Graces</HI> ever in her Presence stand,</L>
<L>And <HI>Virtue</HI> blooms beneath her nursing Hand.</L>
</LG>

<L>By just Expression, and becoming Ease—</L>
<L>Delightful Task! with early Care to teach,</L>
<L>His lisping Tongue, Propriety of Speech—</L>
<L>See on the Stage the little Hero stands</L>
<L N="40">With Eyes uplifted, and extended Hands:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="009141_0007_1030F702C0D85EA0"/>Or from his Lips <HI>Pope</HI>'s liquid Numbers flow</L>
<L>In Streams mellifluous—see the conscious Glow</L>
<L>Burns on his Cheek; perhaps the Strains inspire</L>
<L>The infant Raptures of poetic Fire;</L>
<L N="45">Perhaps 'tis Modesty, with native Grace</L>
<L>Bids rising Blushes tinge his youthful Face:</L>
<L>Or now the <HI>Force</HI> of Eloquence he tries,</L>
<L>And <HI>Attic</HI> Lightnings kindle in his Eyes;</L>
<L>Methinks I see the deep-touch'd Senate glow,</L>
<L N="50">Whilst mimic Thunders threaten from his Brow:</L>
<L>Or now his infant Tongue, in borrow'd Lays,</L>
<L>Swells the <HI>smooth</HI> Tribute of his MAKER'S Praise;</L>
<L>See all the Ardor of the <HI>Saint</HI> exprest,</L>
<L>As if the Numbers fir'd his little Breast.</L>
<L N="55">What Joy to hear, what Rapture to behold</L>
<L>The graceful Bard—so young and yet so bold</L>
<L>In <HI>Virtue</HI>'s Cause—bright <HI>Truth</HI> shall soon inspire</L>
<L>The lively Ardors of a <HI>real</HI> Fire.</L>

<L N="95">To REASON's Eye there shall the Cause appear</L>
<L>Why various Seasons form the changing Year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SPRING first, in Mantle green, and Garlands gay,</L>
<L>Sweet-smelling as she passes, leads the Way;</L>
<L>With breezy Call awakes each rural Sound,</L>
<L N="100">And fills with Music, Woods and Valleys round.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Summer</HI> comes light-clad in glowing Red,</L>
<L>Whilst the thick Foliage nods around her Head;</L>
<L>With lavish Bounty from her Lap she pours</L>
<L>Luxuriant Gifts of Herbage, Fruit and Flowers.</L>
<L N="105">In yellow Garb, see <HI>Autumn</HI> next appear,</L>

<L>And paints with various Hue the fading Groves.</L>
<L>Then boist'rous <HI>Winter</HI> howls along the Plain,</L>
<L N="110">Affrighted Vegetation shrinks again</L>
<L>Back into Earth—Woods, Hills and Valleys stand</L>
<L>Stripp'd of their Pride by his relentless Hand;</L>
<L>In icy Bonds he holds the Water's Fall,</L>
<L>And in his snowy Mantle wraps them all.</L>

<L>His Searches now pursue a nobler Plan;</L>
<L>Now comes that grand Enquiry—WHAT IS MAN?</L>
<L>How form'd? By whom?—Thence shall he learn to know</L>
