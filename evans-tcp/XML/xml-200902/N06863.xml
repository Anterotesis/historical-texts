<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the Liberty of recom∣mending to your Patronage the following Discourse, the Design of which is to record the Military Fame and Character of the late illustrious General WOLFE.</P>
<P>I WILLINGLY undertook the Task, unbiassed and unasked; pre∣suming, tho' my Abilities were far unequal to it, (for an ACHILLES should be described by an HOMER, and an ALEXANDER painted by an APELLES) that it would meet with a favourable Reception, both from the Novelty of the Composition, rarely attempted among us, and the Ex∣cèllence of the Object it celebrates.</P>
<P>AN Address to none but you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> seemed proper on this
<PB N="iv" REF="008702_0003_102FBA1ADC69B650"/>Occasion; because, as it is your Country that gave Birth to, and nursed the Hero, it was but just you should, on that Account, share in the Elogiums, which are due to his Merit; and even pride your∣selves, that, with the general Ap∣plause of the Nation, you can again add to your List of <HI>Kentish Worthies,</HI> in Church and State, in the Army and Navy, the Name of a <HI>Man of Kent,</HI> who is the Glory of the present Age, and will be the Admiration of the future.</P>
<P>Go on, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and prosper. May you never want a Race of Heroes; and may every Man a∣mong you, in the Support and De∣fence of his Country, prove himself a TRUE MAN OF KENT, which is the hearty Wish of,</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF General <HI>James Wolfe,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>E</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xviii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>sent out his Arrows, and scatter∣ed them; and he shot out Lightning, and discomfited them.</HI> These are the Words of <HI>David,</HI> acknowledging, in the Jubilation of a Heart full of Gratitude, the Power of God; when He, the Lord, his Strength and Buckler, the Horn of his Salvation, and high Tower, delivered him from the Hand of all his Enemies, and from the Hand of <HI>Saul.</HI></P>
<P>THE same great and mighty God, <HI>glorious</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. xv. 7.</NOTE> <HI>in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders,</HI> has lately manifested his Power and stretched-out Arm, in Defence of this Nation; his Munificence has showered down upon us all the Blessings of Peace, whilst his Justice makes other Nations feel all the Calamities of War; he has crowned our Arms with signal Successes both by Sea and Land; the
<PB N="6" REF="008702_0005_102FBA259D77CAF0"/>Haughtiness of our inveterate Foes has been co∣vered by him with Shame and Confusion; and if, regardless of his Chastisements, they persist in wick∣ed Designs, in perfidious Dealings, in violent Mea∣sures, he will surely level all their aspiring Thoughts with the Dust, and crush into Abortion their de∣structive Machinations.</P>
<P>WE have always, and now more especially, just Reason to let Praises and Thanksgivings dwell on our Lips, and in our Minds, for the singular Mercies it has pleased God to shew us. Let us therefore raise the Voice of Exultation, let us sound the Trumpet of Praise, let us pay the Tribute of Thanks to the Most High. This our Felicity, next to, and under the Direction of his all-gracious providential Care, we are indebted for to his Ma∣jesty's wise Councils, which the Event has proved to have been planned with a judicious Forecast, and executed with a no less noble than vigor∣ous Spirit. It was these wise Councils that made Choice of General JAMES WOLFE for the Conquest of <HI>Quebec,</HI> the Capital of the <HI>French</HI> Empire in <HI>North-America.</HI> He did not hesitate to obey his Orders, or cavil with his Instructions; his Country called him forth; he went, fought the Enemy, and died crowned with Victory.</P>
<P>HERE, what a Scene, mingled with Glory and Pity, Joy and Sorrow, Triumph and Mourning, presents itself to View!</P>
<P>How glorious was it for a small Body of Troops, amidst a Multiplicity of Obstacles, almost unsur∣mountable, to defeat so numerous an Enemy; and
<PB N="7" REF="008702_0006_102FBA27278DC738"/>yet we pity that Bravery, that Ardour, that Incen∣tive to Honour, that Sense of Duty, that Love of the Country in the noble Commander; because, as the moving Spring to animate others with Motion, as the powerful Example begun and shewn in himself to lead on to Conquest, he was thereby prompted to hazard and lose a Life so precious to his Country!</P>
<P>HARK! what Shouts of Joy rend the Sky whilst <HI>Britons</HI> cry VICTORY! The neighbouring Moun∣tains send back the Sound! <HI>Quebec</HI> hears it, chilled with Horrors; the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations stand astonish∣ed: But alas! this Joy, so full of Confusion for the Enemy; so sweet a Source of Pleasure for <HI>Britons,</HI> is soon marred with Bitterness. <HI>Britons</HI> see, with Sorrow painted on their down-cast Faces, their General breathing his last; they count over, with Regret, his honourable Wounds; and while they bathe them with their Tears, they cannot help thinking, that, that Victory must be inestima∣ble, which required for its Purchase the Blood of so great and so good a General.</P>
<P>Lo! Triumphs were not wanting, to declare the Importance of our Conquest. They were not, indeed, those Triumphs that dazzle the Sight, by the Splendor of an external solemn Pomp; but they were Triumphs in the Heart of every true <HI>Briton,</HI> and every sincere Wisher to the Welfare of his Country. Our <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies had long experienced all the Inconveniences of a more than troublesome Neighbourhood; they were delivered up, by an encroaching and rapacious Enemy, to the Incursions and Depredations of the
<PB N="8" REF="008702_0007_102FBA2E77584A08"/>most barbarous Savages: Let us draw a Veil over the Treatment they received, over the uncommon Cruelties exercised upon them; Humanity cannot stand the Shock of a bare Representation! What must be their Thoughts when the welcome News came to them of the Conquest of <HI>Quebec?</HI> All their Fears were dissipated; the certain Hopes of future Peace and Security smiled upon them; every Breast glowed with Triumph. <HI>Britain,</HI> a fond Parent, felt the warm Emotions of the dear Chil∣dren she had nurtured and educated with so much Care. How deeply was she, some Time ago, afflicted to learn their Distress? She rode on the rapid Wings of Tenderness to their Relief; her potent Arm raised them up; it bade them follow to the Revenge of Battle; and now she exults with them in Triumph. O great and glorious Triumph, how magnificent wouldst thou have been, were the Triumphs of mortal Man, pure, unsullied, and unmixed! Thy Brightness is ob∣scured, thy Beauties fade, they Gaiety grows sullen, when the Reflection starts upon us, dismal and doleful Reflection! proclaiming aloud, that WOLFE is dead; WOLFE! that valiant Captain, whose auspicious Conduct is the Cause of all our Tri∣umph. Then, O then, the Eye is seen to mourn; the Countenance in vain recals its Sprightliness; nay, the whole Body, to shew it sympathizes with the sincere Regret of the Mind, would willingly clothe itself with a Garb expressive of Sorrow!</P>
<P>BUT cease, ye unavailing Tears! Cease to flow! Ye flow without Reason! WOLFE is not dead. He now enjoys a Life of Immortality. His Me∣mory will be for ever dear to <HI>Britons.</HI> Heaven,
<PB N="9" REF="008702_0008_102FBA3006146580"/>summing up his heroic Virtues, judged them to be ripe for the Fruition of eternal Happiness. Yes, O Divine Being, Author of all good Gifts! <HI>He</HI>
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxi. ver. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>asked Life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even Length of Days for ever and ever: His Glory is great in thy Salvation, Honour and Majesty hast thou laid upon him.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the ineffable Rewards that await Vir∣tue; such General JAMES WOLFE is now in the quiet and undisturbed Possession of; he now sits exalted above the Reach of impotent Envy, which cannot detract from his Merit; and this his Merit will appear in the most conspicuous and amiable Light, after passing in Review the principal Ac∣tions of his Life.</P>
<P>JAMES WOLFE has a just Claim to very honour∣able Progenitors. He was the Son of Colonel EDWARD WOLFE, and was born at <HI>Westerham,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> where he was baptised <HI>January</HI> the 11th, 1726. It is said of him, that, even in his earliest Youth, he had by Words and Actions exhibited several Specimens of what he was one Day likely to be: So true it is, that the natural Disposition will work its Way, and shew itself in the Display of ingenious Contrivances, when the Application of Art and Precepts, where it is wanting, will have little or no Effect. His illustrious Parents, who could easily discern in him the Dawn of great Hopes, were assiduous to im∣prove it into the Maturity of strong, bright, and vivid Rays. Every Thing in young WOLFE con∣tributed to second their Intentions; he not only
<PB N="10" REF="008702_0009_102FBA338EB2FC38"/>performed whatever he was enjoined with all the Alacrity of Inclination, but even his Performance was admirable; and the more so, as it far exceed∣ed his Years. Happy Genius! destined by such evident Marks to be the Support and Ornament of your Country.</P>
<P>THESE were only the Rudiments and Essays of tender Childhood: The Flower was still in the Bud; it only glistened bedecked with the Pearls of Morning Dew. But, when once its native ge∣nial Warmth began to transmit the generous Sap, it opened, it blowed, into all the Charms of Adolescency. Now we behold young WOLFE, not insensibly, but, by a brisk and lively Progress, learning and practising all the Duties, and all the Virtues, that spread their Lustre on a well-instituted Life. His Apprehension was exceeding quick and clear, penetrating almost in a Moment into the deepest Recesses of whatever was necessary for him to know: His Judgment, acute and solid, readily determined him in the Choice of what was best; and his Memory, easy and retentive, laid up for his Use, as in a faithful Repository, all his precious Acquisitions. Society, as in a Mirrour, could con∣template in him all the Perfections that tend to in∣hance its Benefit. His Friendships were the more sincere and constant, as being cemented on the Groundwork of Reason; yet not so restrained to the Sweets of particular Attachments, as ever to exclude a more extensive Spirit of Benevolence, which glow∣ed in him, to promote the universal Good of Man∣kind. Hence he was polite, affable, gentle, free, and unreserved in his Conversation; no stiff, sullen, for∣bidding, haughty, boisterous Airs ruffled the Sere∣nity
<PB N="11" REF="008702_0010_102FBA3513C20B60"/>of his Countenance; and, as his Graces were truly engaging, actuated by Honour, replete with Candour, devoid of Affectation, so none ever refused him the kindest Wishes of their Hearts.</P>
<P>BESIDES these social Virtues, and many others which might be enumerated, he possessed, even in those Years, that Purity and Integrity of Mind, which made him on all Occasions adhere strictly to the Dictates of Justice, and withal inspired him with such a deep Sense of Religion, that the good Christian did not seem so much added to, as to crown and complete the Uniformity of his Conduct. And, indeed, it was this Sense of Religion that im∣parted Spirit and Motion; nay, I may say, covered with the Shield of Intrepidity, and fitted the Wings of Impetuosity to, the Courage which afterwards appeared in his military Character. He was tho∣roughly convinced within himself, that he who is regardless of his Duty to God, will be but a super∣ficial Observer of his Duty to his Country and Prince. The Officer whose Vigour of Mind and Body is emasculated by Voluptuousness, whose Ap∣petites relish nothing but Immoralities, cannot look at an Enemy in the Face: He either flies, betray∣ing the dastardly Spirit of a Coward; or, over∣whelmed by all the Horrors of conscious Guilt, kneels, deprecating the Vengeance of the uplift∣ed Arm ready to strike the fatal Blow: Where∣as the Christian Soldier, who complies with his Duty, not by Necessity, but by Choice; not through the servile Fear of Reproach, but for the Welfare and Glory of his Country, is not abashed to meet his Foe; he is seized with no Horrors of Conscience to make him grovel in Timidity; his Mind is e∣rect,
<PB N="12" REF="008702_0011_102FBA3697E87008"/>steady, and active; no Difficulties can ob∣struct his victorious Sword, nor no Dangers deter him from executing the Purpose of his Soul.</P>
<P>ALL the Actions of WOLFE expressed this Pour∣trait of the Christian Soldier, from the very Time he embraced the Profession of Arms, which was so early as when he was but just able to bear them. Eager to receive Instruction, punctual to obey Command, assiduous to form himself and others to all the Exactness of military Discipline, he soon merited the Esteem of his Equals, and was ho∣noured with the Commendations of his Superiors. How wonderfully does Praise operate on an ingen∣uous Mind! It is its Sting, its Spur, its Fire; it rouses, it pushes on, it inflames the whole Man to atchieve the most gallant Exploits: Yet WOLFE, though sensible of it, was far from being puffed up with vain Pride: Praise may flatter others with the Thoughts of Self-sufficiency, with an over Confi∣dence in their Abilities; but in him its Effects were only predominant to the Out-doing of him∣self in still greater and more spirited Acts.</P>
<P>DURING the last War he was present at almost every Engagement, in which he bore no inconsi∣derable Part, signalising his Courage by vigorous Attacks upon the Enemy, and frequently his Con∣duct, in a very masterly Manner, amidst Dangers and Difficulties. No Wonder, then, if his military Genius was singled out, as one that promised to appear eminently distinguished in the first Rank. But, whilst it was thus rising apace, admired and applauded by all, Peace lulled to Rest the Horrors of War, and cut short his fond Hopes of gathering fresh Laurels.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008702_0012_102FBA3E10A4E128"/>
IT happens but too often, upon the Declaration of a Peace, that both the Officer and Soldier, to wear down the disagreeable Impression of the many Fatigues and Hardships they underwent in the Service of the War, greedily catch at the A∣musement of every Relaxation, or rather the Bait of every Pleasure that presents itself. This In∣chantment, so sweet and ravishing in the Taste it affords, is fraught with a sure though slow Poison. The Desires are stimulated to a further Indulgence, and at length Habit so rivets the Chains of soft Dalliance, that the martial Hero, encompassed by them, is surprized, when called upon to exert his former Valour, that he cannot possibly find him∣self. Not so with WOLFE. Recreation and Plea∣sure never so prevailed over him as to make him forget what he owed to himself and to his Country. All the Nerves of his warlike Disposition were kept firmly braced; and, studious to improve the important Lessons he had already learned into a lasting Advantage, he wisely made the Ease and Leisure of Peace instrumental to the cultivating of the Arts of War.</P>
<P>AND who but he could so properly make War his Study? Who but he discovered the mighty Genius for it? The more we take a View of this Genius, the more we shall be enamoured of it: No Quality was wanting to it, which seemed requisite to form and magnify the Hero. Ancient and modern Discipline were equally known to him: He united the most shining Talents of the best Masters in the Science of War in his own Person; fully persuaded, that it is not Speculation, which may be vain and idle, but Contrivance, Industry, and Application that complete the Warrior.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008702_0013_102FBA4193D85E38"/>
OF this I call you to be the Witnesses, ye six Battalions, that fought so gloriously in the Plains of <HI>Minden!</HI> All the <HI>French</HI> Cavalry felt your Shock, striking down and ravaging like a Thunder-bolt. It was not a wild Force, rushing forth with preci∣pitate Rashness, and often spending itself in the Impetuosity of its Efforts, that broke and routed the Enemy's Squadrons; it was the Regularity and Exactness of Discipline WOLFE himself infused in∣to one of these Battalions, when he governed it as Lieutenant-Colonel. By the Instinct of his Capa∣city it leads the Way in that Field of Fame; the rest speed after the great Example: Inclination calls them to it, and Death is dealt from every Blow of the invincible Legion!</P>
<P>THIS is thy Victory, here are thy Trophies, O WOLFE! I say again it was the Instinct of thy Capacity that conquered in the Plains of <HI>Minden:</HI> Thy Spirit, thy Elevation, Presence of Mind, and Judgment were present at the Battle: They guid∣ed the Work thy Hands had fashioned; and this Work overthrew the Enemy, with great Slaugh∣ter. All <HI>Europe</HI> heard of it and was amazed! <HI>Britain</HI> knew thee, her Son, to be the Author of it, and therefore she now records the Glory of this Day in her Annals to thy immortal Honour!</P>
<P>WHEN, at the Breaking-out of the present War, the great Minister, who now sits at the Helm of Affairs, was making strenuous Efforts to cut off the Hydra-Head of Faction, and to awake the na∣tional Spirit from the ungrateful Slumbers it was laid in, WOLFE, fresh with manly Life, appeared upon the Stage of Action, to put in Practice, for
<PB N="15" REF="008702_0014_102FBA4535B41BA0"/>his Country's Service, the profound Study we have seen him make in Peace of the Arts of War. The Minister's discerning Eye pointed him out to be a powerful Aid to those, who, in Right of Se∣niority, claimed the Command, for executing his Designs against <HI>Rochfort;</HI> though the ill Success of that Affair gave us afterwards Reason to wish the Claim had been founded on the Right of un∣disputed Merit, influenced and biassed by the un∣feigned Love of the Country. However pure and upright the Patriot Minister's Intentions were, it may be said, that, his Administration being then in its Infancy, and not so thoroughly established, Feuds, Animosities, and Jealousies had not yet subsided; and that there remained a Deal of the old Leaven, to corrupt the Mass of the new, yet true System of Policy, if it was not purged off by due Circumspection. Time alone, and a true Es∣timate of our real Interest, can produce these de∣sirable Effects; and it is therefore we shall leave the well-projected Attack of <HI>Rochfort</HI> in the Ob∣scurity it has been involved in, observing only, to the
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">What is here asserted may be seen authenticated by our best Accounts.</NOTE> Honour of our young Hero, who was Quar∣ter-Master-General upon this Expedition, that he, with other Officers, whilst our Fleet remained in the Bay of <HI>Basque,</HI> the Weather being at the same Time very favourable for a Descent, went on Shore one Night, and walked two Miles up the Country without Interruption. Every Part of the Beach was found by him and his Company to be firm and dry; no Encampment, no Troops, no Batteries upon it. All, upon their Return to the Fleet, pressed the landing of the Troops with great
<PB N="16" REF="008702_0015_102FBA4CF93D6588"/>Warmth; and, to the very last, there did not ap∣pear to be any great Body of Men near the Shore, though something looked like an Encampment.</P>
<P>As it was practicable to land; as no sufficient Body of the Enemy's Troops or Batteries were dis∣covered to prevent it; as there was no Difference in the Situation of <HI>Rochfort,</HI> contrary to the Intel∣ligence given at Court; the Failure of the Expe∣dition seemed to be chiefly grounded on not taking or attacking Fort <HI>Fouras.</HI> This was certified by the brave WOLFE; who took the Liberty, as he says himself, of suggesting his Opinion to Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Hawke,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Mordaunt,</HI> That he did not doubt but a Ship of War might batter Fort <HI>Fouras,</HI> and that a Body of Troops might be land∣ed at the same Time, and attack it with Success: He took the Liberty also to mention, as he only had seen the Fort, that, if Sir <HI>Edward Hawke</HI> thought proper to make a Diversion near <HI>Rochelle</HI> at the same Time, it might engage the Attention of the <HI>French,</HI> and give an Opportunity of making a Descent between: He further hinted his Opi∣nion, as to sending the Bomb-Ketches out, not knowing but Bombs might be thrown into <HI>Rochelle;</HI> and he mentioned another Circumstance, in regard to sending for the Pilot of the <HI>Magnanime,</HI> who would inform Sir <HI>Edward</HI> if there was Depth of Water sufficient to carry a Ship up to <HI>Fouras;</HI> adding, from the indifferent Opinion he had of the Fort, a forty or fifty Gun Ship might at least an∣noy the Fort, so as to give an Opportunity of landing.</P>
<P>HERE were Dispositions worthy the most ex∣perienced General; Dispositions which in all Pro∣would
<PB N="17" REF="008702_0016_102FBA50A31D6910"/>have been attended with Success in the Ex∣ecution, if they had been hearkened unto with a real Intention of doing effectual Service. The ge∣nerous Heart of WOLFE could not help testifying its Regret for such a Stagnation in Resolution, which appeared but too sensibly: And, as he sin∣cerely wished well to his Country, what indignant Emotions must have filled his Breast, to see an expensive and formidable Armament serve only the Purposes of a vain Parade! Well may Com∣plaints and Murmurings be heard from most Quar∣ters; not against the Minister nor the Admiral; for their Glory, far from being eclipsed, rose su∣perior to all Envy: The Minister had still a WOLFE who was willing and able to wipe away the Na∣tion's Disgrace; and this he did, when the brave <HI>Amherst</HI> suffered him, uncontrouled, to exert his Talents for the Taking of <HI>Louisbourg.</HI></P>
<P>ON
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>London Gazette</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 18, 1758.</NOTE> the 2d of <HI>June,</HI> 1758, when our Fleet, with about a Third of their Complement of Troops, anchored in <HI>Gabarus</HI> Bay, the gallant WOLFE, then a Brigadier-General, in Conjunction with General <HI>Amherst,</HI> the Commander in Chief, and Brigadier-General <HI>Lawrence,</HI> reconnoitred the Shore as near as they could; and made a Disposition for landing in three Places the next Morning, in Case the rest of the Troops arrived. The Weather continuing very bad, and the Swell of the Sea high, the Landing could not possibly take Place till the 8th; at which Time Brigadier-General WOLFE was the first that rowed into the Shore with his Detachment. The Enemy did not throw away a Shot, till his Boats were near in Shore,
<PB N="18" REF="008702_0017_102FBA545FF65B98"/>and then directed the whole Fire of their Cannon and Musquetry upon them. Notwithstanding their Fire, and the Violence of the Surf, which made it almost impracticable to find a Place for getting a Boat on Shore, Brigadier WOLFE pursu∣ed his Point; and, landing just at the Left of the Cove, took Post, attacked the Enemy, and forced them to retreat. Several Boats overset, several were shattered to Pieces, and all the Men jumped into the Water, to follow their intrepid Leader.</P>
<P>MANY were the Services whereby he afterwards signalised himself during this Siege; and particu∣larly, when, on Intelligence received that the Ene∣my had destroyed the grand Battery, and called in their Out-posts, he was detached with 1200 Men, four Companies of Grenadiers, three Companies of Rangers, and some light Infantry, round the north-east Harbour to the Light-House Point, to silence the Island Battery, and at the same Time to attempt to destroy the Ships in the Harbour. He took Possession of the Light-House Point, with all the Posts on that Side the Harbour, which the Enemy had abandoned, with several Cannon; and, when a large Party of them had crept out one Morning, to get some old Palisades and Wood, he pushed them in with a brisk Fire; and, taking Posts on the Hills, from whence it was intended to try to demolish the Shipping, he marched forward on the Right, and forced the Enemy back to <HI>Cape Noire,</HI> with a smart Fire. After this, a great Cannonading continuing from the Town and Shipping on our Batteries, he was making an ad∣vanced Work on the Right, thrown up at 650
<PB N="19" REF="008702_0018_102FBA579F57F8B8"/>Yards from the Covered-Way, with an Intention of erecting a Battery to destroy the Defences of the Place. The next Thing he did, was to push on a Corps, and take Possession of the Hills in the Front of the Barasoy, where he made a Lodg∣ment: And, lastly, a few Days before the Town capitulated, his Batteries contributed greatly to burn three of the Enemy's Ships. In short, it is incredible what extraordinary Feats he performed in this Siege; and all of them the genuine Effects of his distinguished Abilities, his Conduct and In∣trepidity; which rendered him a Terror to the E∣nemy, and not without just Reason the Safeguard and Ornament of his Country.</P>
<P>ON his Return home, what Encomiums were passed upon him by all Degrees of Men! But he, modest and discreet, ascribed all the Glory to the prudent Management of him under whom he fought. It was a sufficient Satisfaction to himself that his Country had been faithfully served, and that he had done what he thought only his Duty. Unparalleled Moderation in the Manner of accepting the Tribute of Praise! Yet it is by these and the like humble Sentiments that exalted Merit appears in the Bloom of never-fading Beauty. Pride, and Arrogance, and Self-conceit will make but a Con∣temptible Figure; and, notwithstanding all En∣deavours to impose by a glaring Outside, cannot help shewing the ridiculous Deformity.</P>
<P>WOLFE then deserved, as the Restorer of the Reputation of the <HI>British</HI> Arms; as the Conquer∣or of <HI>Cape Breton</HI> with the noble <HI>Amherst;</HI> to ride with him in the triumphal Car of Fame.
<PB N="20" REF="008702_0019_102FBA592363EBD8"/><HI>Amherst</HI> does not refuse to acknowledge him the Partner of his Glory: Even without Jealousy he felicitates him that others think as well of him as of himself; and, to declare how eminently he stands in his Esteem, he generously recommends him to his Country, as worthy of the highest military Command. This Recommendation, tho' powerful, and highly valued by the grateful WOLFE, did not however carry that Force and Energy with it as his own Actions. They spoke aloud what he was and what he would be; and, though silent himself, uninfluenced by Ambition, which he was never known to court through the Mediation of the Great; intirely passive in the Disposal that might be made of his Abilities, he was called upon, as the useful Man in the Exi∣gencies of the State, to command the important Expedition against <HI>Quebec.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is something secret in Nature, not to be defined or expressed by Words, which, on consi∣dering certain Objects, rouses the Passions from the Indolency of Indifference, to make them im∣bibe the Delicacies of Refinement, and elates the Soul with a full Prospect of Grandeur, Magnifi∣cence, Excellence, and Delight. Such is the Cosideration of WOLFE's Spirit in the conducting of this Enterprise; it is an Object that quickens the dull Lethargy of the Passions into the liveliest Transports; we cannot withold our Admiration of it; the Soul sometimes quietly and joyfully rests in its Contemplation; sometimes she is winged into Extasies; for she finds in it both Grandeur and Delight: Not Grandeur and Delight contracted within a narrow Compass, as in a
<PB N="21" REF="008702_0020_102FBA5F9540CFA8"/>Meadow variegated with Flowers, and receiving an additional Beauty from a purling Brook, taught to water the tender Grass; but Grandeur and Delight, vast and extensive, as in the unbounded Prospect of Hills and Vales, inumbrated with tall Cedars, and watered by an expanded River.</P>
<P>FEW or none ever before rose to WOLFE's great Reputation in War, till they had first obtained and firmly established it by repeated Victories and Commands. He, in some Measure, as an unpre∣cedented Example, building upon the Foundation of scarce any other Advantages than the Expectati∣on he had raised of himself, at once gained such an Ascendant in the Love of his Fellow-subjects, the Confidence of the Soldiery, the Esteem of the Officers, the Respect of the Government, the Fa∣vour of the Court, that all, with undisguised u∣nanimous Suffrages, placed him in the Summit of this Command. We shall now see how he behav∣ed himself in it, how he proved himself worthy of it; as otherwise a General must have little Reason to value himself upon the most shining Success.</P>
<P>WHEN
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Gazette of <HI>October</HI> 16, 1759.</NOTE> General WOLFE appeared before <HI>Que∣bec,</HI> in the River of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> with his Troops, he found the Obstacles to his intended Operations much greater than he had Reason to expect, or could foresee, and chiefly from the na∣tural Strength of the Country, which the Enemy seemed wisely to depend upon. To complete their Security, Succours of all Kinds had been thrown into <HI>Quebec,</HI> and a numerous Body of re∣gular
<PB N="22" REF="008702_0021_102FBA62B31CE660"/>Troops, joined to the Troops of the Colony, filled up with every <HI>Canadian</HI> that was able to bear Arms, besides several Nations of Savages, had taken the Field in a very advantageous Situ∣ation.</P>
<P>WHAT was the Prospect of reducing a Place which was every Way so well prepared for a vi∣gorous Defence? General WOLFE could not flat∣ter himself that he was able to effect it; yet, with his little Army, whose Courage and Resolution he could depend upon, he hoped, if an Opportunity offered of attacking that of the Enemy, however superior and formidable, he should disconcert their Measures by dispersing them, and so as to facilitate with Success an Attack upon the Town.</P>
<P>THE Enemy were encamped along the Shore, and intrenched in every accessible Part. On his Landing upon the Isle of <HI>Orleans,</HI> he found it ab∣solutely necessary both to possess himself of, and to fortify, the Point of <HI>Levi,</HI> and the Westermost Point of the Isle; because, from either the one or the other, the Enemy might make it impossible for any Ship to lie in the Bason of <HI>Quebec,</HI> or even within two Miles of it. This Service being per∣formed with little Loss, he ordered Batteries of Cannon and Mortars to be erected with great Dispatch on the Point of <HI>Levi,</HI> to bombard the Town and Magazines, and to injure the Works and Batteries. The Enemy, perceiving these Works in great Forwardness, passed the River to attack and destroy them; but, falling into Confusion, they fired upon one another, and went back; and the Effect of this Artillery was so great though a∣cross
<PB N="23" REF="008702_0022_102FBA6631134738"/>the River, that the Upper Town was consi∣derably damaged, and the Lower intirely destroy∣ed.</P>
<P>THE Variety of his other Dispositions, Strata∣gems, and masterly Strokes of Generalship, are still so recent in every one's Memory, that a Detail of them is unnecessary; and it will be sufficient to say, that, to draw the Enemy from their Situation, and bring them to an Action, he at last formed and ex∣ecuted that great Plan of conveying his Troops a∣bove the Town, after leaving the Points of <HI>Levi</HI> and <HI>Orleans</HI> in a proper State of Defence. He was but just then recovered from a dangerous Fit of Illness, yet his bodily Strength, as if not in the least impaired, was so refreshed by the Vigour of his Mind, that he was present in Person, active, dili∣gent, and indefatigable, wherever any Thing was to be done or ordered for taking an Advantage of the Enemy. Thus fulfilling, in his whole Man∣ner, the Character of <HI>Caesar;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nil actum reputans si quid supresset agendum.</HI></P>
<P>AND now the Enemy being obliged to quit their Post, collected the whole of their Forces, and ad∣vanced to give Battle, which they could not avoid. General WOLFE, in the mean Time, put his little Army in extreme good Order, and displayed his Ranks so as to strike a Terror into the Enemy by the Appearance of a far greater Number than he really had. Cool, provident, and prepared in this Manner for all Events, his Troops shewing, at the same Time, a Countenance mixed with Alacrity and Steadiness, he received the Enemy's first Shcok,
<PB N="24" REF="008702_0023_102FBA6C8242ACA0"/>which, as it is customary with them, was very brisk and animated. But this their Vivacity, from a little Check, is soon relaxed into the Debility of unresisting Languor; the Man degenerates into Woman, and can only exert a like impotent Strug∣gle. WOLFE prudently reserved his Fire till he was within forty Yards, and then it was so well continued, and with so good Effect, that the Ene∣my every where gave Way. In this Onset, a Musquet-Ball pierced through, and shattered the Bone of his Wrist; but, regardless of such a pain∣ful and desperate Wound, he immediately wrapped it up, and, quite unconcerned, followed the impe∣tuous Blow he had just struck, giving the Enemy no Time to recover from the Consternation and Confusion he had thrown them into. Then it was, in the Midst of the Havock he was making, thin∣ning and mowing down their Ranks, that, a se∣cond Ball passing through his Body, he fell at the Head of his brave Grenadiers, as they were darting, like Lightning, to assail with their Bayonets.</P>
<P>OH! WOLFE; what a melancholly Fall was this for thy Country, yet, glorious and honoura∣ble to thee, and still more glorious and honourable by the Circumstances that attended it! When faint and breathless, through the Effusion of thy Blood, thou wast, by the Mournful Ministry of a few Soldiers, carried off from that Scene of Victory, ready to proclaim thee the Conqueror of <HI>Canada,</HI> thou didst, still intent upon the Event, raise thy drooping Head, and check the mighty Conflicts of thy Soul, hastening to sever herself from thy Body: This thou didst with new Life and Mo∣tion, when the Shout of, <HI>They run,</HI> sounded in
<PB N="25" REF="008702_0024_102FBA6ED545D4D0"/>thy Ears. Thou didst ask, with all the Eagerness of strong Perturbation, <HI>Who run?</HI> and receiving the joyous Answer, that the Enemy were routed, with a complete and decisive Overthrow, thou didst reply, in tender Emotions for thy Country's Success, <HI>Then, I thank God, I die contented.</HI> Peace and Composure, with these Words, sealed thy Eye∣lids, and thy Head gently reclining, willingly re∣signed thy mortal Life.</P>
<P>IF we search the Records of History for a Death like that of WOLFE, shall we find one, in all Re∣spects, so Noble? Many have fought for their Coun∣try, and died in its Defence, perhaps with Sentiments of Magnanimity equal to his, and with as undaunt∣ed a Resolution to submit to the Laws of Fatality; but how few, under his Circumstances, have gra∣ced Death with such attractive Charms, that what commonly is abhorred as an Evil, seems pleasing, welcome, and desirable? We praise then, we mag∣nify such a Death; we exult within ourselves, that we can produce such an Example to awake Imita∣tion upon a like Occasion; and we even say, that so to die, is not to die in Effect, is not to be ex∣tinct and forgotten, but to live in the Memory of future Ages, till that Duration comes when Time shall be no more.</P>
<P>WOLFE has acquired that Life of lasting Me∣mory; none envy it him; <HI>He flourishes like the Balm-tree, and shall be exalted as the Cedar of Le∣banon;</HI> every grateful <HI>Briton</HI> has already raised a Monument to him in his Breast; and Marble shall be taught, under the Hands of the Artist, to pay him its Homage, by all the emblematical Il∣lustrations of Heroism it is capable of expressing:
<PB N="26" REF="008702_0025_102FBA705A2CCA58"/>But what shall we further say, and what shall we feel, whilst, with admiring Eyes, we survey the Apparatus of this condign Pomp, whilst the magnificent Objects convey to us an Idea of the Excellence they represent? We shall say, <HI>It is</HI> WOLFE <HI>that has deserved all this:</HI> We can say no more; we feel the rest; we feel the bright Effigies of his Glory making our Bosoms to pant, but its Beauties are not to be told; neither can we describe its Height and Depth; the Imagination wanders in a Maze, and cannot figure out the exact Mea∣surement.</P>
<P>IF we place this Death of WOLFE in another Point of View, looking back to the Cause for which he died, a Cause no other than the Love of serving his Country; we shall have Reason to lament that Ardour which exposed him so much to the Perils of War, and set open against him the greedy Jaws of Mortality before his Time; we shall imbibe a little Tincture of Jealousy against the Monuments and Trophies, destined as if too soon to perpetuate his Memory; we shall accuse as a little too hasty the putting him in Possession of such an Accumu∣lation of Glory. Just Regret! just Jealousy; just Complaint! His Country has suffered by his Loss; she now is thoroughly sensible of it; she wishes his Life had been protracted into a full Length of Days; and she sighs, apprehensive of not finding a Man like him to fight her Battles.</P>
<P>HENCE is the Source of Tears for WOLFE's Death, which refuses to be intirely dried up; and hence the plaintive Voice of Grief, which has been beard from all Parts of the <HI>British</HI> Realms. It
<PB N="27" REF="008702_0026_102FBA760A843708"/>will still be renewed with the deepest Concern, whenever we approach that hallowed Ground where his precious Remains are deposited, or visit the Monuments consecrated to his Memory. Thither we shall come inspired with a reverential Awe for the Place! for the Virtues that guard its Precincts, with Frowns and stern Looks, bid the Prophane stand aloof. The pure in Heart and Well-wishers to their Country will come, and mourning in the Silence of their Hearts, will sometimes start with Surprise, and speak within themselves; "Then WOLFE is dead?—Surely he is gone too soon!— Propitious Heaven lent him only for a Day!— Death found him too fine a Victim!—And is he then dead? He who was the Author of so much Happiness to us! He who was the Son of Honour, truly brave, truly noble, friendly and candid, gentle and beneficent, great and glorious!"</P>
<P>BEHOLD, the Soldier comes! He whose Hands WOLFE had taught and fitted to battle, and whose Soul he had filled with Courage and Perseverance: He mourns his Loss in him, the best of Officers, because with him his chief Happiness is vanished. WOLFE had always a Fellow-feeling for him; his Treatment of him was always humane; and he never let his Services pass unrewarded. What Af∣fection, what Gratitude, what Willingness, what Confidence, what Ardour, must not Manners so conciliating in the General, excite and cherish in the Soldier!</P>
<P>AND thou, lovely
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Miss <HI>L—th—r.</HI></NOTE> Maid! will come: Thou, to whom Choice, guided by Reason pointed out WOLFE as the deserving Object of thy Affections. The innate Worth of his manly Soul kindled in
<PB N="28" REF="008702_0027_102FBA79547A89D8"/>thee the tenderest Sentiments. He gave and thou didst catch the Flame: Conscious Love cannot sinother its Fires; the Glow bursts out, and each Heart burns alike, and each Heart collects its Heat into the warmest Wishes for completing a lasting Union. The Decorum of Life and Virgin-Modesty post∣pone the happy Day. In the mean Time, his Country's Cause calls WOLFE away. Love may bid him decline its Support; may paint with Hor∣rors to him the Aspect of War; but he, mindful of the Dictates of Honour, and, above all, of the Duty he owes to his Country, removes, without Reluctance, from his Sight the Blandishments of Love, and all the alluring Sweets of domestic Ease and Felicity; and, though he fondly may desire to embrace and enjoy them, for the Sake of her, and with her, who generously makes a Tender of them; yet they ought not, in his Opinion, to take Place of the Pleasure that will arise from the Con∣sciousness of having done well in the Service and for the Love of our Country. The Way to these Pleasures is beset with Hardships, Difficulties, and Dangers; to the other smooth, easy, and secure: Yet it seemed not so eligible to WOLFE, who knew the inestimable Value of the pure Satisfaction of the Mind, and, at the same Time, did not slight the Gratification of Sense, if it was in his Circumstan∣ces immediately consistent with his Honour. Thou also, illustrious Maid, Mirrour of thy Sex! thou couldest not delight in the Man in whose Honour thy discerning Eye did perceive the least Stain. Thou wast as tender of WOLFE's Honour as he could be himself: He flew with thy Approbation and good Wishes to the Field of Glory, and fanci∣ed himself sufficiently happy, if he could at his
<PB N="29" REF="008702_0028_102F7547876E38C0"/>Return lay at thy Feet his Harvest of Laurels. Alas! thou art too sensible how he was prevented; thy Sorrows need not be renewed; for the dear Image of his Virtues is so often present to thy Mind, that every Time thou wouldest gladly drop a Tear into his Urn.</P>
<P>EVEN so, as <HI>Britons</HI> now their WOLFE, the <HI>Jews</HI> formerly lamented their <HI>Judas Maccabeus. They</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Maccab. c. ix. ver. 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>bewailed him, and all</HI> Israel <HI>made great Lamentati∣ons for him, and mourned many Days, saying, how is the valiant Man fallen that delivered</HI> Israel! Just was the Cause of their Lamentation; for the <HI>fought</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. iii. ver. 3, 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>with Chearfulness the Battle of</HI> Israel. <HI>He got his People great Honour, and put on a Breast-plate as a Giant, and girt his war like Harness about him, and he made Battles, protecting the Host with his Sword. In his Acts he was like a Lion, and like a Lion's Whelp roaring for his Prey: For he pursued the Wicked, and burnt up those that vexed his People. Where∣fore the Wicked shrunk for Fear of him, and all the Workers of Iniquity were troubled, because Salvation prospered in his Hand. His Memorial is blessed for ever.</HI> Cannot we say, after a close Examination of the Features of this Pourtrait, but that WOLFE ex∣hibits a very striking Resemblance of them? His moral Character shewed the <HI>Judas Maccabeus</HI> in him; his military Character is only clouded by the Number of <HI>Judas</HI>'s signal Victories; but his Exit was as glorious.</P>
<P>EPAMINONDAS, the great <HI>Theban</HI> Captain, (whom WOLFE also resembles, as dying, like him, victorious over his Enemy) being asked, which of his Friends he loved best; answered, that they
<PB N="30" REF="008702_0029_102FBA7F6A4482C8"/>must all die before he could be positive in deciding the Degree they held in his Esteem. The same Thought has been adopted and improved by o∣thers, but by all with the Intention of inculcating, that none can be deemed truly good and happy before they die, Death alone being the Test of their Actions, so far as it points out, by a just Measure, the Depravity and Rectitude discoverable in them. If <HI>Britons</HI> were now asked the Question, which of their Generals they love best; they would answer, without Hesitation, WOLFE; because the Conduct of his whole Life was invariably the same, great and good, and Death authenticated and ratified this Greatness and Goodness, by affixing her Seal to it with an indelible Impression. Other Generals, re∣nowned in History for being great Masters in the Art of War, appear in a very contemptible Light, when divested of the external Pageantry that obscures the Deformity of their Actions in private Life: They are then the mere Man, and not the Hero. The Success of their Enter∣prizes, however obtrusive of the Ideas of Pomp and Grandeur on weak Minds, cannot ex∣tenuate the pernicious Effects of their Ambition, or Avarice, or Lust, or Cruelties, or Oppression. To gratify these inordinate Passions, they waded through a Sea of Blood; they led Armies in∣to a Field of Slaughter; they taught them the Way and Manner of butchering one another; and, in the End, instead of fighting the Bat∣tles of their Country in Support of its own Inde∣pendency, or the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, they proved the merciless Destroyers of God's Creatures, and the Violaters of the most sacred Laws of human Society. Death often seized upon them
<PB N="31" REF="008702_0030_102FBA820B7BE548"/>in the Midst of their Havock and Outrages, and transmitted them, as they deserved, deeply branded with the Ignominy of their enormous Guilt, to the Horror and Detestation of Posterity. Not so with WOLFE: Without Ambition, Avarice, or any other Vice, his Talents were employed in Defence of the Independence of his Country, with which the Rights and Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> are intimately con∣nected: As another <HI>Judas Maccabeus, be fought with Chearfulness its Battle; his People by it got great Honour; be burnt up those that vexed his Peo∣ple; Salvation prospered in his Hand, and his Me∣morial is blessed for ever.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT GOD! just and terrible in thy Judg∣ments, with what an humbling Blow to Humanity hast thou struck us, by the Death of our beloved General JAMES WOLFE! But, Lord, if thou dost unsheath thy Sword, it is not to destroy, but to mend; it is not to blast our Hopes, but to make them spring with a fuller Bloom; it is not to crush us under the Weight of thy Vengeance, but to teach us to rise superior to all Disasters. Thou hast in JAMES WOLFE set an Example to our Generals and Officers, that, by faithfully copying after it, they may learn to relinquish voluptuous Ease, des∣pise Dangers and Difficulties, and, when necessary, fall gloriously, like him, for their Country. Stung and quickened by noble Emulation, behold they make ready to run for the Prize in the same Course of Glory. It is PITT, who, with thy divine Provi∣dence, was appointed the tutely Genius of this Nation, that leads the Way with Precept. Thy Wisdom has replenished him with the good Gifts of deliberating maturely, judging soundly, counselling securely,
<PB N="32" REF="008702_0031_102FBA850B3EF3B8"/>ordaining exactly, and executing effectually. He has introduced the Blessings of Harmony and good Understanding between our Commanders both by Sea and Land; they now no longer obstruct the Nation's Welfare by Contradictions, Dissensions, and Disobedience. Oh! may the Blessing conti∣nue! And may we never want a PITT, under the auspicious Influence of his Majesty, to find for us another WOLFE; whose Loss, though we are sincerely afflicted for it, thy all-gracious Care, O God, has abundantly compensated, by preserving to us his Like in <HI>Amherst, Monckton, Townshend, Hawke,</HI> and <HI>Saunders!</HI></P>

<P>Stop, Passenger! And here view whatever is Grand and Noble, Summed up in the Character of JAMES WOLFE.</P>
<LG>
<L>His Mind being adorned with all heroic Virtues,</L>
<L>Both by the Precept and Example of his illustrious Father,</L>
<L>Colonel EDWARD WOLFE;</L>
<L>He, early in Life, as the Choice of his natural Disposition,</L>
<L>Embraced the Prosession of Arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With indefatigable Industry forming the Military Man,</L>
<L>He shewed himself</L>
<L>Gallant in Action, intrepid in Danger, circumspect in Difficulties;</L>
<L>And being soon singled out as a true Genius for the Art of War,</L>
<L>With the Approbation and Applause</L>
<L>Of the great Officers he served under,</L>
<L>Was honoured, in a constant Succession,</L>
<L>With the most distinguished Posts in the Army.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His innate Courage, his Regularity and Exactness of Discipline,</L>
<L>Shone conspicuous in the Corps he had himself trained up,</L>
<L>When animating five others by its Example in the Plains of <HI>Minden,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>French</HI> Cavalry, by the Impetuosity of their Efforts,</L>
<L>Were broken, routed, and discomfited.</L>
<L>Posterity! believe it:</L>
<L>the Annals of all <HI>Europe</HI> attest the Fact.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His martial Ardour and Capacity,</L>
<L>Restrained by superiour Command at <HI>Rochfort,</HI></L>
<L>Were signal in the Overthrow of <HI>Louisbourg.</HI></L>
<L>You may stile him, with <HI>Amherst,</HI> the CONQUEROR of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI></L>
<L>The Brave do not envy the Brave;</L>
<L>He let him act according to the generous Purpose of his Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now thought worthy of a Command in Chief;</L>
<L>QUEBEC,</L>
<L>The Capital of the <HI>French</HI> Empire in <HI>North-Amercia,</HI></L>
<L>Is made the Object of the important Conquest,</L>
<L>Expected from his great Abilities.</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="008702_0035_102FBA902FDF62E8"/>
Art had conspired with Nature</L>
<L>To render the Place impregnable:</L>
<L>But he, undaunted amidst such a Scene of Difficulties,</L>
<L>Climbs over Rocks and Precipices,</L>
<L>Lays the Lower Town in Ashes,</L>
<L>Draws out the numerous Force of CANADA against him,</L>
<L>And with less than five thousand Men</L>
<L>But stout, vigorous, and ardent for Battle,</L>
<L>Routs and defeats them with great Slaughter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>VICTORY, alas!</L>
<L>Had scarce dawned upon him with triumphant Rays of Light,</L>
<L>Ready to salute him,</L>
<L>The CONQUEROR of <HI>Canada,</HI></L>
<L>When he fell gloriously,</L>
<L>Covered with honourable Wounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Britons!</HI> rejoice and mourn:</L>
<L>Rejoice that your Arms have prospered</L>
<L>Under the Conduct of so great a General;</L>
<L>But mourn for the Loss</L>
<L>Of so good a Man,</L>
<L>Whose Morals, a Copy of Gospel-Purity,</L>
<L>Taught him to die contented for his Country.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To perpetuate his Memory,</L>
