<HEAD>A Recommendation From several of the <HI>Elder Pastors</HI> in the COUNTREY.</HEAD>
<P>HAving had a View of a Book entituled, <HI>AGRICOLA,</HI> Or, <HI>The Religious Husbandman,</HI> and being sensible, that it is a Book wherein the Main Intentions of <HI>Piety</HI> are ser∣ved with much Accommodation; we earnestly recommend it unto a Countrey greatly and mostly subsist∣ing upon <HI>Husbandry;</HI> and heartily wish, that no Family in the Countrey may be without a Book, wherein the best of Purposes are so well provided for.</P>

<HEAD>A Recommendation, From the United Pastors in <HI>Boston.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>TO Spiritualize the common Actions of Life, and make a religious Improvement of world∣ly Affairs, is an</HI> holy <HI>and</HI> happy Art: <HI>A</HI> Walk with God <HI>very much lies in</HI> this, <HI>and is greatly assisted by it: This is a part of that</HI> Spiritual∣mindedness <HI>which is</HI> Life <HI>and</HI> Peace. <HI>Were Christians better skill'd in this, their worldly Business might be a</HI> Help, <HI>rather than a Hin∣drance to them in their way to Heaven. Now no worldly Calling is more capable of a spiritual Improvement than that of the</HI> Husbandman: <HI>And as it is a Calling which necessarily takes up so great a part of the Sons of Men, to teach them the</HI> spiritual Use <HI>of it must needs be a noble and blessed Design. This is the Design of the present</HI> Tract; <HI>wherein the main Intentions of</HI> PIETY <HI>are serv'd with an excellent Accommodation, in the Business and Language of</HI> Husbandry. <HI>So our Saviour fetch'd several of the</HI> Parables <HI>where∣in he instructed his Auditors, from the</HI> Calling of the Husbandman. <HI>And tis to be hop'd such a Book as this, (which instructs the Husbandman how to</HI> dress his Soul, <HI>while he</HI> dresses his Ground, <HI>and to make sure of his being receiv'd to a</HI> Crown <HI>in Heaven, when he is taken from the</HI> Plow <HI>on Earth) will meet with a</HI> general Acceptance <HI>in a Country the Business of which is mostly</HI> Husbandry, <HI>and which has been famous for</HI> religious Husbandmen.</P>
<P><PB REF="002905_0004_0FE6912CF2FDE0F8"/>
<HI>Indeed this Design has been excellently serv'd in the Labours of those Servants of GOD,</HI> Flavel <HI>and</HI> Steel: <HI>But their</HI> Treatises <HI>are not common among</HI> us: <HI>Neither is it to be suppos'd that they have gather'd in</HI> all the Sheaves <HI>of this plenti∣ful Harvest. Or if we are in this treated with the same things, 'tis in a</HI> different Method, <HI>and with that</HI> Fervour <HI>and</HI> Pungency <HI>which is so peculiar to the Author.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Concerning the</HI> very Reverend Author, <HI>we heartily pray that GOD would still continue him long to Labour in his</HI> Harvest, <HI>and crown all his</HI> laborious <HI>and</HI> excellent Essays <HI>to serve the Kingdom of GOD, with the desired Success. And concerning</HI> this Essay <HI>in particular, (while we recommend it to</HI> all the Families in the Coun∣try) <HI>we can't but with Fervency wish,</HI> GOD SPEED THE PLOW.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Call from <HI>Heaven,</HI> which every Man upon <HI>Earth</HI> is deeply concerned in. It is introduced so, <HI>Thus saith the Lord unto the Man,</HI> in the singular Number; Be∣cause every single <HI>Man</HI> is to look on himself as ad∣dressed in it. Unto every <HI>Man</HI> whatever, it may now be said, <HI>O Earth, Earth, Earth, Hear the Word of the Lord.</HI> There is a <HI>Plow</HI> ordered for thee; a <HI>Plow,</HI> the penetrations whereof thou must submit unto.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002905_0007_0FE691A017F50A98"/>
When the Illustrious and Immortal Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI> passed by One at the <HI>Plow,</HI> for whom GOD intended uncommon Favours, the Prophet put up∣on him the <HI>Melota,</HI> which he wore upon his <HI>Head;</HI> and Lo, the <HI>Influences of Heaven</HI> accompanied it, so that he left the <HI>Plow,</HI> and he could let nothing hinder his becoming a <HI>Man of GOD,</HI> and a fol∣lower of the best Man in the world.</P>
<P>It seems, to be at the <HI>Plow,</HI> is to be where the <HI>Influences of Heaven</HI> may find us. Oh! That what passes from the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Speaker</HI> may be accom∣companied with <HI>Influences of Heaven</HI> on the <HI>Heart</HI> of the <HI>Hearer.</HI> But what? <HI>Leave the Plow,</HI> upon it! GOD forbid. The Sermon, may find us at the <HI>Plow;</HI> But whether so or no, the design of the Sermon will be, to bring us all to the <HI>Plow,</HI> yea, to keep us at it all our Days.</P>
<P>The Glorious GOD calls a sinful People to REPENTANCE: REPENTANCE, without which 'tis impossible a Sinner should be prepared for the <HI>Blessings of Goodness.</HI> Of this <HI>Repentance,</HI> we have a notable Description, in that very Ex∣pressive and Instructive Metaphor; <HI>Break up your fallow Ground.</HI> Now, certainly tis the <HI>Plow</HI> in its <HI>Work,</HI> that is thus to <HI>Break up the fallow Ground.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Plow,</HI> that grand Instrument of <HI>Husbandry;</HI> which we may celebrate, as, <HI>The Ancient,</HI> and, <HI>The Honourable! The staff of Bread</HI> must sail us, and we must soon fall down into the <HI>Earth,</HI> if the <HI>Plow</HI> wherewith we sollicit the <HI>Earth</HI> for our <HI>Bread,</HI> were <HI>taken away.</HI> Doubeless, its Antiquity is higher than the Days of <HI>Tubal-Cain.</HI> And how much it Rivals the very <HI>Seeptre</HI> may be pondered, when we re∣member; <HI>The profit of the Earth is for all; the King himself is also served by the Field.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002905_0008_0FE691A292927C70"/>
The <HI>Plow</HI> which is now called for, is, That which brings a <HI>Repenting Sinner,</HI> to what we must all come to, that we may find mercy with GOD. The <HI>Breaking up of the fallow Ground,</HI> with the <HI>Plow, is,</HI> The bringing of the Sinner to that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which is necessary for him.</P>
<P>And the DOCTRINE of GOD our SAVI∣OUR, the <HI>entrance</HI> of which now to <HI>give light unto</HI> us is This.</P>
<P>'Tis in the way of REPENTING, that they who have <HI>sinned,</HI> may look to be saved from the evil Effects of their <HI>Sin;</HI> And there must be seen <HI>the PLOW breaking up our Fallow Ground,</HI> in this REPENTANCE.</P>
<P>In the sacred <HI>Prophecies,</HI> with which the <HI>Scrip∣ture of Truth</HI> has been, as a <HI>Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning in a Dark plnce</HI> unto us, the Times that are to be <HI>longed</HI> for, [The <HI>Souls under the Altar</HI> cry out, for them, <HI>How long!</HI>] even the Times, when the <HI>promised King∣dom of GOD</HI> shall arrive, and the <HI>Times</HI> which <HI>ac∣cording to his Promise we look for;</HI> This is given as the Character of them; Isa. II. 4. <HI>They shall beat their Swords into Plow-shares.</HI> My Brethren, There will be a praelibation of those glorious Times in it, if the <HI>Plow-shares</HI> may now so come into their ope∣ration, as to <HI>break up our fallow Ground,</HI> and pro∣duce the <HI>Repentance</HI> in us, which will never be <HI>Re∣pented</HI> of.</P>
<P>In the Prosecution of this Intention, let us En∣quire, first; What is the <HI>fallow Ground,</HI> which in the work of <HI>Repentance</HI> requires the <HI>Plow</HI> to be em∣ploy'd upon it?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002905_0009_0FE691A2AF169C78"/>
Verily, 'Tis the <HI>Heart</HI> of Man. O Man, 'tis thy <HI>Heart,</HI> and my <HI>Heart,</HI> that is the <HI>fallow Ground.</HI> Whenever thou seest any <HI>Ground</HI> lying <HI>fallow,</HI> thou mayst say. <HI>I now see a Soyl which my sinful Heart may be sadly compar'd unto.</HI> And, Oh! what will become of us, if the <HI>Plow-share</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> do not go deep into it!</P>
<P>REPENTANCE will bring us to make these Acknowledgments; and we shall make them with the bitterness of <HI>Wormwood</HI> and of <HI>Gall,</HI> and with a <HI>Soul humbled in us.</HI></P>
<P>First; A <HI>Repenting</HI> Sinner will acknowledge This; <HI>My Heart is a very barren Soyl. Fallow Ground</HI> has growing upon it, none of those <HI>good things</HI> which we set a value on. It has enough of those things which are <HI>good for nothing,</HI> or, perhaps worse than so. Our <HI>Heart</HI> is this <HI>fallow Ground.</HI> It is an <HI>Heart</HI> that is destitute of good Principles; and good <HI>Ends,</HI> and good <HI>Frames,</HI> and good <HI>Thoughts,</HI> are not now the <HI>natural Growth</HI> of the Soyl. Our Nature being wofully corrupted by our fall from GOD, our complaint must be That; Rom. VII. 18. <HI>I know, that in me, (that is, in my Flesh,) there dwelleth no good thing. O Wretched Heart that thou art;</HI> How empty of all that is <HI>Good!</HI> It must come from an Hand which takes <HI>pains</HI> for thy <HI>good,</HI> if any <HI>good</HI> be found in thee. But for the Reverse thereof, enough of <HI>that!</HI> The <HI>Thorns</HI> &amp; the <HI>Thistles</HI> of the <HI>cursed Ground</HI> are not such unhappy things as what our <HI>Heart</HI> is over grown withal. What <HI>natural∣ly grows</HI> in our <HI>Heart,</HI> &amp; appears without our taking any <HI>pains</HI> to bring it forward, is, what will be yield∣ed, by an <HI>Heart fully set in us to do evil.</HI> What can be imagined, but what is <HI>Evil</HI> enough in an <HI>Heart,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002905_0010_0FE691A9A2E97C18"/>whereof every Imagination is <HI>Evil continually?</HI> What will be the <HI>growth</HI> of a <HI>carnal Mind</HI> that is full of <HI>Enmity against GOD;</HI> and of an <HI>Heart,</HI> that is <HI>desperately wicked?</HI> The <HI>growth</HI> of such a <HI>Soyl</HI> has been told us, by Him who <HI>searches the Heart;</HI> Mat. XV. 19. <HI>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fornications, Thefts, False Wit∣ness, Blasphemies; The Things which difile a Man.</HI> What <HI>Thorns,</HI> what <HI>Hen-bane,</HI> and <HI>Hemlock!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; A Repenting Sinner will acknow∣ledge This; <HI>My Heart is a very harden'd Soyl. Fal∣low Ground</HI> is become <HI>hard;</HI> by lying long undis∣turbed, its parts come to stick very close to one another. Perhaps, 'tis the more <HI>hard</HI> for being often trod upon. Our <HI>Heart</HI> is this <HI>fallow Ground.</HI> The <HI>Truths</HI> of GOD which are the <HI>Seeds of Life,</HI> the <HI>Rays</HI> that are shot from the <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which <HI>drops as the Rain,</HI> will not enter into so tough a Soyl. Our <HI>Heart</HI> will resist all good Admonitions; and <HI>Essays to do good,</HI> signify nothing, because of what we read of; Rom. II. 5. <HI>Thy hardness and impenitent Heart.</HI> Our <HI>Heart</HI> will remain as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad as it was; and will receive no Be∣nefit from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>means of good,</HI> that are used upon us. It has been so long under the Feet of <HI>Satan,</HI> that now it will deny entrance to all that is good: No Counsels, no Warnings, nothing at all, will <HI>enter into the Fool.</HI> In a <HI>Turn</HI> to GOD, this is usually one of the first things, that is complained of: <HI>An hard Heart! An hard Heart! An Heart which there is no moving of!</HI> That moan is heard; Isa LXIII. 17. <HI>Our Heart hardened from thy Fear.</HI> Oh! For∣lorn <HI>Heart!</HI> How <HI>shut up,</HI> against GOD, and CHRIST, and all the good that he offers to do unto it!</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002905_0011_0FE691A9C224EF58"/>
Let us Enquire, Secondly; What are those ope∣rations of <HI>Repentance,</HI> in which the <HI>Plow</HI> is to <HI>break up</HI> this <HI>fallow Ground?</HI></P>
<P>You take it for granted, The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, accompanied with the Influences of the Holy SPIRIT, is the <HI>Plow</HI> with which this work of GOD is carried on. And now,</P>
<P>First; In a true <HI>Repentance,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> is <HI>broken,</HI> with a <HI>sense</HI> and <HI>grief</HI> of the <HI>Sins,</HI> which the great GOD has been offended at. There is a <HI>compuncti∣on</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and a <HI>contrition</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> in that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which therefore, O Transgressor, thou art so lothe to come unto, Of <HI>Penitents</HI> we read, Act. II. 37. <HI>They are pierced in their Heart.</HI> And of <HI>Penitents</HI> we read, Psal. XXXIV. 18. <HI>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken Heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite Spirit.</HI> We are advised; <HI>By sorrow of Heart, the Spirit is broken.</HI> The <HI>Earth</HI> is not more <HI>broken</HI> by the <HI>Plow</HI> tearing of it, than the <HI>Heart</HI> of a <HI>Repenting</HI> one, is <HI>broken</HI> with the <HI>sorrow</HI> of <HI>Repen∣tance.</HI> There is a <HI>godly sorrow working of</HI> and in <HI>Repentance.</HI> The <HI>Repenting</HI> one makes a <HI>sorrowful Reflection,</HI> on what he has done in sinning against the glorious GOD. With an <HI>Heart-breaking</HI> Re∣gret, and Remorse, and <HI>sorrow,</HI> he thinks;
<Q><HI>I have sinned, and I have done very foolishly.</HI> But, Oh! What have I done, when I have sinned! I have <HI>deny'd the GOD that is above,</HI> and set my self and my <HI>Idols above</HI> him. I have trampled on the <HI>Au∣thority</HI> of my <HI>Maker;</HI> defied his <HI>Power,</HI> derided his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> despised his <HI>Goodness,</HI> disputed his <HI>Faithfulness;</HI> and opposed his <HI>Holiness.</HI> I have slighted the SON of GOD, and scorned all his gracious <HI>Tenders.</HI> I have vexed the SPIRIT of
<PB N="7" REF="002905_0012_0FE691AB465F2A20"/>GOD, and stifled all his gracious <HI>Motions.</HI> I have disobliged the <HI>Angels,</HI> and gratified the <HI>De∣vils.</HI> I have <HI>wronged</HI> my own Soul, and <HI>ruin'd</HI> all my Interests. I have refused <HI>eternal Pleasures,</HI> and incurr'd <HI>eternal Torments;</HI> all for a meer <HI>sha∣dow</HI> of a <HI>delight,</HI> which is but for a Moment. Oh! What <HI>madness</HI> has possessed me!</Q> Such sentiments as these enter with the wounding force of a <HI>Plow-share</HI> into the <HI>Heart</HI> of a <HI>Repenting</HI> one. He feels that anguish from them, that makes him cry out, <HI>My Heart is broken, O GOD, my Heart is broken. My wounded Spirit; Oh! I cannot bear it!</HI> This, O thou that hast <HI>gone on in thy Trespasses,</HI> This is what the <HI>Plow</HI> must bring thee to; Psal LI. 17. <HI>The Sacrifices of GOD, a broken Spirit; a broken and a contrite Heart.</HI> And let not this be forgotten; One conspicuous and perpetual <HI>mark</HI> of the <HI>broken Heart,</HI> will be This; The <HI>Heart</HI> is, like the <HI>Earth</HI> yielding to the <HI>Plow</HI> and what follows upon it, made willing to comply with the <HI>whole Will</HI> of GOD: Willing to come into whatever <HI>shape</HI> GOD would have it brought into; willing to be any thing, do any thing, take any thing, that GOD shall order for it. The <HI>Repenting</HI> one, lyes at the Foot of the glorious GOD, and says, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. In a true <HI>Repentance,</HI> the <HI>Heart</HI> is left no longer under the <HI>Dominion</HI> of the <HI>Lusts,</HI> that were the <HI>Weeds</HI> of the Soul. There is the <HI>Lust</HI> of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and the <HI>Lust</HI> of the <HI>Eye,</HI> and the <HI>Pride of Life,</HI> which engross the Soul, and bind the powers of it fast, in opposition unto GOD. These <HI>Weeds</HI> which cover the face of the Earth, in our <HI>Heart,</HI> and hinder our being filled with the <HI>Fruits of Righ∣teousness,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002905_0013_0FE691AB64294748"/>are extirpated in that <HI>Repentance</HI> which brings us unto GOD. What the <HI>Penitent</HI> comes to is that; Rom. VI. 16. <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you. Penitents</HI> have the experience of such a Deliverance, as that; Psal. CXVI. 16. <HI>Truly, O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant; Thou hast loosed my Bonds.</HI> The <HI>desires of the Flesh and of the Mind,</HI> and the <HI>diverse Lusts,</HI> which are the <HI>Root of bitterness</HI> in the Soul, the intention of <HI>Repentance</HI> is to disturb them; and anon the <HI>Heart</HI> of the <HI>Repent∣ing</HI> one becomes dispossessed of them. These poi∣sonous <HI>Weeds of Death</HI> are disturbed, yea, they are destroyed by the <HI>Plow,</HI> in the <HI>Heart</HI> of such as are by <HI>Repentance</HI> brought home unto GOD. No <HI>Lust</HI> can live quietly in a <HI>Repenting</HI> Soul. Every <HI>Lust</HI> comes under a <HI>Mortification</HI> in the <HI>Heart</HI> of such an one. The <HI>Plow share</HI> does a notable Execution upon the <HI>Weods;</HI> and the Voice of the <HI>Repenting</HI> one is that; Hos. XIV. 8. <HI>What have I any more to do with Idols?</HI> The <HI>Repenting</HI> one comes to Re∣nounce the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and say, <HI>I will never do what I judge to be a Sin, that my Flesh may have its pleasures.</HI> He comes to Renounce the <HI>World,</HI> and say, <HI>I will never do what I judge to be a Sin, that. I may gain the Riches of the World.</HI> He Renounces the <HI>Devil;</HI> and rejects and repels the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the <HI>wicked</HI> one. The Language of <HI>Repentance</HI> is, <HI>O take away all Ini∣quity.</HI> Whatever dispositions to Sin, a <HI>Repenting</HI> one finds in his Heart, tho' they have never such a deep <HI>rooting</HI> there, yet the <HI>Heart</HI> under the <HI>Plow,</HI> is become desirous to be delivered from them all: It says, <HI>Lord, let my Heart be cleared of all those abo∣minable weeds, which cleave to an evil Heart of Unbe∣lief, departing from the living GOD. Oh! do thou tear
<PB N="9" REF="002905_0014_0FE691B2CF8B10A0"/>them to pieces, and let there be none to deliver them.</HI></P>
<P>¶ You have seen how the <HI>Plow breaks up the fal∣low Ground,</HI> in the work of <HI>Repentance;</HI> But it must now be demanded, that you immediately feel the <HI>Plow</HI> operating on you.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>GOD speed the Plow,</HI> when the <HI>good work of his Grace,</HI> is making its way into your <HI>Hearts,</HI> in those Admonitions of PIETY, which are now brought unto you from him.</P>
<P>We read, Prov. XXI. 4. <HI>The plowing of the wick∣ed is Sin.</HI> All his employment is nothing but <HI>Sin.</HI> Even what he does in his <HI>lawful Calling</HI> being de∣signed only for <HI>himself,</HI> 'tis no better than <HI>Sin.</HI> He looks no higher than <HI>Earth,</HI> in what he does, and so he does nothing but <HI>Sin;</HI> Yea, Even <HI>wearies himself to commit Iniquity.</HI> But now, Another sort of <HI>plowing</HI> is exhorted to; The <HI>plowing</HI> which is to be used, in the <HI>confessing</HI> and <HI>forsaking</HI> of all <HI>wick∣edness,</HI> and in <HI>Repenting of Sin.</HI> In order to this;</P>
<P N="1">I. You must apprehend well, the mighty and awful <HI>Importance</HI> of that REPENTANCE, which must be found in all the sinful Children of Men, that would not <HI>perish in their Sins. Lo, GOD hath sent forth his Voice, and that a mighty Voice,</HI> unto all that sin against him; And, <HI>There is no Man that sinneth not.</HI> Yea, he has uttered it more than once; Luk. XIII. 3, 5. <HI>Except ye Repent, ye shall perish:</HI> And again, <HI>Except ye Repent, ye shall perish.</HI> 'Tis indeed, what the <HI>Conscience</HI> of every Man does preach unto him. <HI>Conscience,</HI> Do thou now lend thy Hand unto the <HI>Plow.</HI> And, Oh! let the <HI>Heart</HI> now under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, feel these <HI>Questions,</HI> pass like so many <HI>Plow-shares</HI> into it.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002905_0015_0FE691B2EB003978"/>
Question. I. Don't you really think, that you have been guilty of enough to be <HI>Repented</HI> of? A <HI>Mind</HI> so disaffected unto the glorious GOD! A <HI>Life</HI> so full of Rebellion against him! And not enough to be <HI>Repented</HI> of! Surely, The best of us all have cause enough to come unto That; Job. XLII. 6. <HI>I abhor my self, and I repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P>Question. II. If you now come unto <HI>Repentance,</HI> can you doubt whether a merciful GOD will re∣ceive you; or whether you shall not be the <HI>Blessed</HI> ones, whose <HI>Transgression is forgiven, and Sin covered?</HI> What? When you have that Assurance from the Mouth of the glorious One; Isa. LV. 7. <HI>Return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy; and unto our GOD, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI></P>
<P>Question. III. Can you <HI>suppose,</HI> that if you de∣cline the <HI>Repentance</HI> that you are called unto, you can look for any other than a <HI>fiery Indignation to devour</HI> you? Or, that a Righteous GOD will not be <HI>Terrible in his doings</HI> to them, who lift them∣selves among his Adversaries? What? When you are warned; Psal. LXVIII. 21. <HI>GOD shall wound the Head of his Enemies, and the hairy Scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his Trespasses.</HI></P>
<P>Question. IV. If you <HI>dy</HI> before you come unto <HI>Repentance,</HI> will it not be forever <HI>too late</HI> for you; or can you suppose, that your cry, <HI>Lord, have mer∣cy upon me;</HI> will avail any thing, or be any other than all <HI>too late,</HI> when the Pit hath shut its mouth upon you, and you are lodged among <HI>Devils</HI> in the <HI>place of Torment?</HI> What? When you are so taught; Isa. XXXVIII. 18. <HI>They that go down to the Pit, cannot hope for thy Truth.</HI></P>

Question. V. What is the plain <HI>Language</HI> of the <HI>Procrastination,</HI> wherewith you put off <HI>Repen∣tance?</HI> Don't you <HI>plainly say,</HI> That <HI>Sin</HI> has nothing to be dreaded in it? That GOD is not worthy of your <HI>Love;</HI> and his <HI>Threatnings</HI> are nothing to be regarded? That His CHRIST has nothing that is <HI>precious</HI> to bestow upon you; and you can do well enough without him? And, <HI>What shall be given to thee, what shall be done to thee, O Tongue</HI> that can speak such things as these? What <HI>sharp Arrows</HI> of the Almighty One; what <HI>Coals</HI> more ardent and more lasting, than those of <HI>Juniper?</HI> It may be said, as in Psal. XXXVI. 1. <HI>What says the Transgression of the Wicked?</HI></P>
<P>O Souls thus Expostulated withal; what, what <HI>Impression</HI> does the <HI>Plow</HI> make upon you?</P>
<P N="2">II. 'Tis to be vehemently insisted on; It can by no means be dispensed with: You must pre∣sently endeavour to go thro' such a PROCESS OF REPENTANCE, as <HI>lays hold on Eternal Life</HI> You have it <HI>Reveled from Heaven</HI> unto you, Act. XXII. 30. <HI>GOD now commands Men every where to Repent.</HI> And the <HI>Wrath of GOD is Reveled from Heaven</HI> against you, till this be done. What you have now to do, is with a <HI>Change of Mind,</HI> from the <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> you have had, while you have <HI>walked in the Vanity of your Mind,</HI> Seriously and Regularly to do the Actions of a <HI>Repenting</HI> Soul. Retire; And own your selves <HI>Unable</HI> to Return unto GOD, and <HI>Unworthy</HI> that He should Enable you; but implore the Help of <HI>Sovereign Grace</HI> on this Grand Occasion. Then, Call over, Confess, Bewail, your <HI>Transgressions</HI> on what is <HI>Forbidden,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002905_0017_0FE691B462C40A28"/>and what is <HI>Required</HI> in the <HI>Commandments;</HI> Em∣ploying the Explanation of the <HI>Commandments,</HI> which you have in the <HI>Catechism,</HI> for this purpose: But above all, mourn over that <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which is the <HI>Fountain</HI> of all your <HI>Transgressions;</HI> and an <HI>Heart</HI> that is the <HI>Mother of Abominations.</HI> Hereupon, Shew and Plead the <HI>Blood</HI> of your SAVIOUR, that you may be <HI>cleanfed from all Sin;</HI> Pray, Beg, Weep, for the <HI>Pardon</HI> of all your Sin: Do this, till you have a comfortable Perswasion from Above, raised in you, <HI>That you are pardoned.</HI> Now, Give up your selves to GOD, with hearty <HI>Desires,</HI> that having done with Iniquity, you may <HI>not offend a∣ny more;</HI> and hearty <HI>Resolves,</HI> That in the <HI>Strength</HI> of CHRIST <HI>living in you,</HI> you will <HI>walk in Holiness and Righteousness before Him,</HI> all the remaining time of your <HI>Pilgrimage.</HI> But let it always be remembred, A <HI>Repentance</HI> without a CHRIST, is but a <HI>Repentance</HI> for a <HI>Devil,</HI> rather than a <HI>Chri∣stian;</HI> there is nothing to be got by it. In the whole <HI>Process of Repentance,</HI> you must keep up an Encouraging <HI>Hope</HI> of <HI>Mercy,</HI> thro' a CHRIST appearing for you. You must behold a CHRIST as having made <HI>Expiation</HI> for the Sins of those those who come unto GOD in His Name to be Forgiven. You must behold a CHRIST as rea∣dy to Assist you in <HI>cleansing your selves from all Fil∣thiness of the Flesh and of the Spirit, and carrying on Holiness to Perfection in the Fear of GOD.</HI> This plain <HI>Process of Repentance,</HI> 'tis what your <HI>Salvation</HI> from the <HI>Evil which pursueth Sinners</HI> depends upon. Till you have pass'd thro' it, you <HI>walk in Dark∣ness, not knowing whither you are going.</HI> Nay, you rather do <HI>know,</HI> that you are <HI>going</HI> down to <HI>Black∣ness of Darkness</HI> for ever.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="13" REF="002905_0018_0FE691BC1565B8E0"/>
III. But What? Is <HI>once</HI> enough? No, There must be a <HI>Repetition</HI> of the <HI>Process.</HI> The <HI>Fallow Ground</HI> will not be thoroughly <HI>broke up,</HI> and <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> will not <HI>have its perfect work,</HI> except the <HI>Plow</HI> do over and over again go over it. A <HI>Re∣penting</HI> Soul must say, as in Psal. LI. 3. <HI>I acknow∣ledge my Transgressions, and my Sins is ever before me.</HI> The Aims of <HI>Repentance</HI> are to be <HI>ever</HI> within us; and the Exercise thereof is <HI>never</HI> to be laid aside. There will be no Method so sure as this, to assure us, That <HI>we have the Repentance never to be repented of.</HI> Let us <HI>Repent</HI> over and over again. The <HI>process of Repentance</HI> must be transacted over and over again. More especially, When any <HI>Calamitous thing</HI> befalls us, now let us, <HI>in the day of Adversity consider, To what special Expressions of Repentance am I now to be Awakened?</HI> And how often do we hear things pressed in <HI>Sermons,</HI> whereof we should make this <HI>Use;</HI> To <HI>Repent</HI> more particularly of <HI>miscarriages,</HI> which we are minded of? Yea, <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> is to be with us, a <HI>Daily Exercise of Godli∣ness.</HI> In our <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Evening</HI> Sacrifices, every Day, there is to be a <HI>Repentance</HI> exercised; and this with some <HI>Recollection</HI> of what we can find amiss in our <HI>past Behaviour.</HI> And as often in the Day, as we are convinced of any <HI>Misbehaviour,</HI> we should with a fresh act of <HI>Repentance look unto Him whom we have pierced,</HI> and <HI>mourn</HI> for what has been <HI>Amiss.</HI> 'Tis with the <HI>spirit of Repentance,</HI> that we are to carry on the whole course of our <HI>Walk with GOD.</HI> The proud <HI>spirit of Quakerism</HI> which has done with <HI>Repentance,</HI> and in its <HI>Assem∣blies,</HI> is never heard with <HI>Repentance</HI> praying for, <HI>The Pardon of Sin;</HI> It cannot but be detestable to
<PB N="14" REF="002905_0019_0FE6912E17D662F0"/>the Children of GOD. There needs no more to make every sober Christian say, <HI>To such Assemblies, O my Soul, be not thou United.</HI> REPENTANCE TO THE LAST, is a Motto for one who <HI>walks</HI> with GOD. The Curtains of our <HI>Death bed</HI> must be hung with <HI>Penitentials.</HI> Our Eyes must be filled with the <HI>Tears of Repentance,</HI> when the cold Hand of Death, is closing of them. Syrs, Here is a <HI>Plow,</HI> that is never to stand still. 'Tis to be going in <HI>all seasons</HI> of the Year; Yea, And <HI>even in the Winter it shall be so!</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. You must not think much of it, if you find <HI>Repentance</HI> to be a <HI>Laborious</HI> thing. If you will do any thing at <HI>plowing,</HI> you must not be they whose <HI>Hands refuse to labour.</HI> The <HI>Sluggard</HI> will do no∣thing in <HI>Repentance,</HI> that will avail any thing. What a miserable Soul, will be the <HI>Field of the Slothful?</HI> O Soul <HI>void</HI> of <HI>understanding! Lo, 'Tis all grown over with Thorns; Nettles cover the Face thereof; and the Stone wall thereof is broken down.</HI> We read, 2. Tim. II. 6. <HI>The Husbandman laboureth.</HI> If the Life of <HI>Husbandry</HI> be <HI>Laborious,</HI> a Life of <HI>Repentance</HI> is no less <HI>Laborious.</HI> GOD will be a <HI>Rewarder</HI> to none but those who <HI>diligently seek Him.</HI> The Business of <HI>Repentance</HI> is to <HI>seek Him.</HI> A <HI>Diligence</HI> must be found in the performances with which we manage it. It is with <HI>all our Might</HI> that we are to do <HI>what our Hand finds to do.</HI> We are to <HI>Toyl</HI> at it, yea, to <HI>Sweat</HI> at it. It is to the <HI>Repent∣ing Beleever,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Laborious Husbandman,</HI> that it has been said, <HI>In the sweat of thy Face thou shalt carry on, what thou hast to do.</HI> Things very tedious, very tiresome, to Flesh and Blood, are to be encountred in a life of <HI>Repentance. O Repenting</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="002905_0020_0FE6912E34B4D410"/>Soul, Thou shalt often be <HI>weary in well doing;</HI> I trust; Never <HI>weary of it.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. But won't you look for <HI>weeping,</HI> as well as <HI>working?</HI> Yes; look for This; That the Glori∣ous GOD will make many <HI>sad Things</HI> to be found among the <HI>Things appointed for you.</HI> This will be, that so the work of <HI>Repentance</HI> may be the more powerfully and effectually carryed on. There will be <HI>Need</HI> that you should be ever now and then in <HI>Heaviness;</HI> without it, the work of <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> cannot well be carried on. Of the <HI>Husband∣men</HI> we read; Psal. CXXVI. 6. <HI>Each one of those in going forth, does mostly weeping go; He carries forth the precious seed, a little to be sown.</HI> He meets with many things, which makes him follow the <HI>Plow</HI> with an <HI>heavy Heart.</HI> You must not think always to do nothing <HI>Sing</HI> at the <HI>Plow. O Repenting</HI> ones, Never <HI>Dream,</HI> That you shall <HI>pass the time of your sojourning</HI> here without <HI>Affliction;</HI> Or, That your <HI>few Days</HI> here, will not be <HI>full of Troubles!</HI> A <HI>Dream</HI> in which there would be <HI>diverse vanities.</HI> What? When your Heavenly Father has told you. <HI>If ye be without Chastisement, then are ye Bastards and not Sons!</HI> This world, what is it but a <HI>Valley of Bacah?</HI> That is to say, of <HI>weeping.</HI> Truly, All your <HI>plowing</HI> will be in the <HI>Valley of Bacah.</HI> Has not your <HI>Faithful</HI> Redeemer <HI>forewarned</HI> you of it? And because of his <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> he willfulfil it. O Disciples of a <HI>Crucified</HI> Lord; look for the <HI>Cress.</HI> The <HI>Plow</HI> and the <HI>Cross</HI> will go together. The things that will call for your <HI>Tears, Lord, how ma∣ny are they? How are the things multiplied, which will trouble you!</HI> Tho' the <HI>ways of Repentance</HI> are on many accounts <HI>ways of pleasantness,</HI> yet there will
<PB N="16" REF="002905_0021_0FE691BC3039F668"/>be some <HI>Troublesome things</HI> in the ways. Tho' you will <HI>sing in the ways of the Lord;</HI> and the worst of them are sweeter than the <HI>Hard ways of the Trans∣gressor;</HI> Yet you must also <HI>weep in the ways.</HI> Ex∣pect many <HI>Troublesome things,</HI> and when they ar∣rive, be able to say, <HI>That which I was afraid of, is come unto me.</HI> And yet, be not <HI>afraid with any a∣mazment!</HI> After the Ground is <HI>plowed,</HI> the <HI>Har∣row</HI> is drawn over it, that so the <HI>work</HI> may be per∣fect, and the Face of the Soyl so Levelled, as to be fit for what is to be cast upon it. When we have <HI>Repented</HI> of our <HI>Errors,</HI> there will be the <HI>Har∣row</HI> of <HI>Affliction</HI> of drawn over us. Yea, our <HI>Af∣fliction</HI> must come after another upon us. Tis all, that so <HI>Repentance</HI> may hvve have its <HI>perfect work.</HI> It must be expected, and it should not be <HI>unwel∣come</HI> to us; That our Faithful Redeemer do by much <HI>Affliction</HI> carry on the <HI>good work</HI> of <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> after he has <HI>began</HI> it upon us. <HI>Harrowed</HI> with much <HI>Affliction,</HI> O penitent Beleever say, <HI>Blessed be my Redeemer who will this way bring me to be what I should be!</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. Nevertheless, hold on, hold out, O RE∣PENTANCE; The <HI>Harvest</HI> will richly repay thee; <HI>Heaven will make amends for all. Repentance</HI> is nothing, if <HI>Perseverance</HI> do not <HI>Crown</HI> it. There is a dreadful Denunciation; Luk. IX. 62. <HI>No Man having put his hand to the Plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of GOD.</HI> Oh! Take heed of all <HI>Backslidings</HI> from good <HI>Beginnings</HI> in <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI> And therefore take a due Notice of the least <HI>Beginnings,</HI> that may lead on to such <HI>Back∣slidings.</HI> Let the <HI>Apostates Doon,</HI> cause you to trem∣ble at all Degrees or Symptoms of <HI>Apostasy;</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="002905_0022_0FE691BD96AD5BE0"/>Tremble at <HI>ending in the Flesh,</HI> after you have <HI>be∣gun in the Spirit.</HI> Hear the tremendous Doom; <HI>If any Man draw back, my Soul shall have no pleasure in him.</HI> Now, that you may <HI>not be wearied nor faint in your Minds,</HI> and that no Temptation to desert the <HI>Plow</HI> may move you; O commit your selves into the hands of a SAVIOUR, who is <HI>able to keep you from falling;</HI> and rely upon Him, to be <HI>kept by His almighty Power, thro' Faith unto Salvation.</HI> But then, Think on the <HI>Harvest</HI> that is a coming; An <HI>Harvest,</HI> wherein <HI>every good thing that a Man has done, the same shall he receive of the Lord.</HI> Indeed unto them to whom it may be said, <HI>Ye have plowed Wickedness,</HI> there will be a proportionable <HI>Reaping</HI> Time; They shall <HI>Reap</HI> what their <HI>Iniquity</HI> will bring them to; <HI>Wo to the wicked; for the Reward of his Hands will be given him.</HI> On the other side; <HI>Plow</HI> in and by <HI>Repen∣tance,</HI> and look for what will be <HI>Reaped</HI> from it. We read; <HI>He that ploweth should plow in hope.</HI> Go on <HI>Repenting,</HI> and keep the <HI>Plow</HI> always going: But still do it, in <HI>hope</HI> of a Time coming, where∣in, <HI>Thy Work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord. Hope</HI> for something infinitely better than what has been in any Country called, <HI>Plow-Money;</HI> Yea, infi∣nitely better than <HI>our Land yielding its Increase</HI> unto us.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Finally; The Work of the <HI>Plow</HI> is in the <HI>Earth;</HI> In the Motions of it, he who drives the <HI>Plow,</HI> must often look down upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> into the <HI>Earth.</HI> And that the Work of <HI>Repentance</HI> may be carried on, it will be of great Advantage un∣to us, to look down unto the <HI>Earth,</HI> whither, O Man, <HI>Thou art going! Thou art art going!</HI> Look
<PB N="18" REF="002905_0023_0FE691BDB60CAF68"/>unto the <HI>Earth,</HI> O ye <HI>Sons of Earthly Man,</HI> and you will see, what will have loud Exciters, and strong Incentives, to <HI>Repentance</HI> in it.</P>
<P>Beholding of the <HI>Earth,</HI> which the <HI>Plow</HI> digs into, Think; <HI>I was fetch'd out of the Earth by the Great GOD, who formed all things.</HI> How much may this Meditation do, To <HI>Humble</HI> you, and <HI>Abase</HI> you, and lay you in the <HI>Dust</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> and cause you to count your selves no better than a poor Clod of animated <HI>Earth,</HI> before the GOD of Heaven, who is the <HI>Lord GOD Omnipotent?</HI></P>
<P>Again; Beholding of the <HI>Earth</HI> which the <HI>Plow</HI> goes into, Think; <HI>In the Earth I have my Grave waiting for me, where I know not how soon I may be lodged.</HI> How much may this Meditation Quick∣en you, to <HI>Make haste</HI> in that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which must be dispatch'd before you <HI>sleep in the Dust,</HI> or else nothing on <HI>Earth</HI> can keep you from an <HI>Hell</HI> for ever to be trembled at.</P>
<P>My Friend, Smell to the <HI>Earth.</HI> 'Tis a very <HI>wholesome Scent.</HI> It will contribute to the Work of <HI>Repentance</HI> wonderfully.</P>
<P>Thus you see the <HI>Plow</HI> in it Opetations. And upon the whole, what shall I say unto you?</P>
<P>A King of <HI>England,</HI> was doubtless well pleased with the Town, where the People presented them∣selves with some hundreds of <HI>Plows</HI> before him. Among all those <HI>Plows,</HI> there was none compa∣rable unto <HI>This;</HI> nor can there be a more accept∣able Present unto the Glorious One, who is <HI>King over all the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>It has been counted a memorable Thing; That among the old <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mans,</HI> they sometimes fetch'd a Man from the <HI>Plow,</HI> and one that was owner
<PB N="19" REF="002905_0024_0FE691C2D7B41D80"/>of no more than <HI>Four Acres</HI> neither, and set him at the head of the Commonwealth. Christian, Keep at this <HI>Plow,</HI> and GOD will one Day <HI>Raise thee out of the Dust, and fetch thee out if the Dunghil, and set thee with Princes, even with the Princes of His People.</HI></P>
<P>I have done. The <HI>Plow</HI> has done its Work, and the <HI>Fallow-Ground</HI> is well <HI>broken</HI> up, if the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD finds now a <HI>free passage</HI> into your Hearts. And, Oh! May your Hearts be now so <HI>opened,</HI> by the Lord, that in whatever <HI>Word</HI> He comes unto you, your <HI>consenting Hearts</HI> may say, <HI>Welcome art thou, O Lord, and welcome is every Word of thine, unto me!</HI></P>
<P>We read of it, as a very Improper Thing; Amos V. 12. <HI>Will one plow upon a Rock?</HI> Sinful Soul, Tho' thy <HI>Heart</HI> be like a <HI>Rock,</HI> Yet, Oh! Let not the <HI>Obduration</HI> continue, and let not all the Exhortations to <HI>Repentance,</HI> be but a <HI>plowing upon a Rock.</HI> But let thy <HI>Relenting Heart,</HI> at least come so far, as to beg it of thy Exalted SAVI∣OUR; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, whose Office it is; Do thou give me both Repentance and Remission of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>I did indeed say, <HI>I have done.</HI> But I know not how to part with my <HI>Plow-man,</HI> until I have ta∣ken a little Notice of something in his Hand, by which the Creatures which draw his <HI>Plow</HI> for him, are Exagitated. He carries a GOAD in his Hand.</P>
<P>We read of a Champion, Judg. III. 31. <HI>He slew six hundred Men with an Ox-Goad.</HI> We may guess a little at the shape of that <HI>Ox-Goad,</HI> and how fit a Tool it was for such an Execution, from what is related by Modern Travellers concerning the <HI>Hus∣bandry</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="002905_0025_0FE69133DC6472A8"/>in those parts of the World. They tell us, That in <HI>plowing</HI> the <HI>Husbandmen</HI> use <HI>Goads</HI> of an extraordinary size. They are <HI>eight Foot</HI> long, and at the upper end, <HI>six Inches</HI> in Circumference. They are armed at the lesser end, with a sharp Nail, for the driving of the <HI>Oxen;</HI> and at the other end, with a small Spade, or Paddle of <HI>Iron,</HI> strong and massy for cleansing of the <HI>Plow,</HI> from the clay that encumbers it in working. In such a <HI>Goad,</HI> behold, a better Weapon than a <HI>Sword,</HI> for a <HI>Shamgar</HI> to employ upon his <HI>Philistines.</HI></P>
<P>All that I shall observe upon it is; There are so many <HI>Goads,</HI> in the <HI>lively Oracles</HI> of GOD, for our <HI>Excitation</HI> and <HI>Instigation</HI> to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and a life of PIETY. We read, Eccl. XII. 11. <HI>The words of the Wise are as Goads.</HI> And such are the <HI>Words</HI> of our GOD by which we are to be <HI>Quick∣ened.</HI> Alas, why do we no more find them so! How stupid a thing art thou, O Man, if thou dost not feel such <HI>pungencies?</HI> But then, the dealings of GOD with thee in his <HI>Providence,</HI> what are these also, but so many <HI>stimulations</HI> to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and a Life of PIETY? If they move thee not, O dull Soul, and if thou do not conform unto them, there is that Voice from Heaven, unto thee on them, Act. IX. 5. <HI>It is hard for thee, to kick against the Goads.</HI> Oh! do not by thy Dilatory proceedings in the <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> provoke him to multiply the <HI>uneasy strokes</HI> of his <HI>Goads</HI> upon thee.</P>

<P>In the admirable Sermons of Him that <HI>spoke so as never Man spake,</HI> which the Gospel, has, as the <HI>Golden Pot</HI> once did the <HI>Manna,</HI> reserved for us, there are about Five or Six and twenty <HI>Parables;</HI> Wherein he condescends unto a way of Teaching, which was much used among the <HI>Syrians,</HI> and which tends to bring the Darkest and Rudest Minds, into an Acquaintance with the <HI>Mysteries of Religion.</HI></P>

<P>And the DOCTRINE, which is now to fall from his Hand [For it is he that <HI>Ministers the Seed unto the Sower!</HI>] as the <HI>Seed</HI> upon the <HI>Field</HI> before him, [O! may it prove as a <HI>Field, which the Lord has Blessed!</HI>] it shall be This;</P>
<P>The WORD of GOD, in the Promulgation of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> is a <HI>Seed</HI> which finds in the <HI>Heart</HI> of Man a very <HI>different Soyl</HI> when it is cast up∣on it; A <HI>Soyl</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> has very <HI>vari∣ous,</HI> Bad and Good Effects upon.</P>
<P>We are enriched with a GOSPEL, which is by our SAVIOUR in his explaining of his own <HI>Pa∣rable,</HI> called, <HI>The Word of the Kingdom.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Word</HI> which Proclaimes a Glorious CHRIST, as the <HI>King upon the Holy Hill of Zion,</HI> who is <HI>Lord of All,</HI> and <HI>has all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Word</HI> which brings the <HI>Law</HI> of this great <HI>King</HI> unto us, and promises unto them that Follow and Obey him, the Glories of an Heavenly <HI>Kingdom,</HI> at his <HI>Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>Of this <HI>Word,</HI> whereof, O <HI>Blessed People</HI> that we are, we hear the <HI>Joyful Sound,</HI> some considerable things are to be now declared unto us.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="002905_0029_0FE691CAB6CB7358"/>
I. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD falling on the Heart of Man, is like a <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Corn,</HI> which the Earth has from the Husbandman <HI>cast</HI> and <HI>sown</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>You need not be told, That the Man who hears the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, and indeed every Man on the Face of the <HI>Darth,</HI> may be compared unto the <HI>Earth.</HI> You are sufficiently apprised of it, That the <HI>Body</HI> of Man, came out of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and again goes into it. The devout <HI>Job,</HI> sitting on the <HI>Earth,</HI> call'd it, His <HI>Mother;</HI> And sitting in his <HI>Mothers</HI> Lap, he confessed; Job I. 21. <HI>Naked came I out of my Moehers Womb, and naked shall I re∣turn thither.</HI> This <HI>Mother</HI> of Man, may well be allow'd a <HI>Figure</HI> of Man. Let it not offend thee, <HI>O proud Man,</HI> if the Term of, <HI>A Clod of Earth,</HI> be put upon thee.</P>
<P>But what I am to tell you, is, On what Ac∣counts, the <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Corn</HI> (or of any <HI>Plant</HI>) resembles the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> that is preached unto them, who <HI>dwell on the Earth.</HI> The Accounts are ma∣ny.</P>
<P>Is there a sort of <HI>Life</HI> in the <HI>Seed</HI> of a <HI>Plant?</HI> Our SAVIOUR, the <HI>Prince of Life,</HI> has told ns; Joh. VI. 63. <HI>The Words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are Life.</HI> O the fair and sweet Things, which pullulate from these <HI>Lively Oracles!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Seed</HI> must be <HI>sown,</HI> or the <HI>Fruit</HI> will be none: If it be kept in the <HI>Granary,</HI> it will never <HI>Fructify.</HI> It is the <HI>speaking</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> that is the casting of the <HI>Seed.</HI> We read, 1 Thess. II. 16. It must be <HI>spoken</HI> to Men, that they may be <HI>saved.</HI> There is ordinarily no <HI>saving</HI> the Souls of Men, but in the way of the <HI>Institution,</HI> the <HI>speaking</HI> and
<PB N="25" REF="002905_0030_0FE6913407AC8DC8"/><HI>preaching</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> unto them. They that are not in the way of it, are not in the ordinary way to be <HI>saved.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Seed</HI> brings forth a <HI>Grain</HI> like it self; The <HI>Fruit</HI> is <HI>after its kind.</HI> What the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD produces, is what is <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>Word.</HI> It is a <HI>Good Word;</HI> and it will <HI>do</HI> us this <HI>Good,</HI> it will make us <HI>Good;</HI> and make us love to <HI>do Good.</HI> It is a <HI>clean Word,</HI> and it will make us to <HI>cleanse our Way.</HI> It is a <HI>Word of Wisdom,</HI> and it will make us <HI>wise unto Salvation.</HI> Yea, 2 Cor. III. 18. We are <HI>changed</HI> by it, <HI>into the same Image from Glory to Glory.</HI></P>
<P>A little <HI>Seed</HI> will go a great way: A few <HI>Sow∣ers</HI> may soon cover an huge Tract of Land. Who can say, how much a few Hands may do in spreading the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD? A <HI>Paul</HI> did it for Thousands of Miles: From <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> was near Three Thousand Miles. What a few Men did, as we find in Col. I. 6. <HI>It brought forth Fruit in all the World.</HI> Yea, One Sermon has con∣verted Thousands. And Hundreds of Thousands have been brought into the Life of GOD, by one little Book; such as <HI>Arndts,</HI> of <HI>True Christianity.</HI> What a <HI>Dispersion</HI> of Truth, has been made by Two such small <HI>Catechisms;</HI> as that of <HI>Heidelbergh,</HI> and that of our <HI>Assembly?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Labour</HI> of the <HI>Sower</HI> will have no <HI>Success,</HI> without the <HI>Blessing</HI> of the Lord, upon the <HI>Seed.</HI> It is <HI>Thou, O Lord, that preparest the Corn.</HI> The <HI>Hus∣bandman</HI> is an <HI>Atheist,</HI> if he do not Think so, and own it. The Ministry of the <HI>Word,</HI> will be Un∣successful, except it <HI>receive a Blessing from GOD.</HI> We are informed; 1 Cor. III. 7. <HI>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but GOD
<PB N="26" REF="002905_0031_0FE691CAD63A8570"/>that giveth the Increase.</HI> The <HI>Success</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> proceeds not from him that brings it, or from the skill with which he brings it; but from the SPI∣RIT of GOD working in it. Let <HI>Isaac sow his Land,</HI> and if the <HI>Lord Bless him,</HI> he will <HI>receive an hundred fold.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; The <HI>Seed</HI> will not presently spring up, at the <HI>first sowing</HI> of it; No, <HI>Behold, the Husband∣man waits for the precious Fruit of the Earth.</HI> Nor does the Ministry of the <HI>Word,</HI> presently see all the Effect that it is to see. The <HI>Word</HI> may ly for some while under Clods, in many an unconcerned Soul. GOD by some occurence in his Providence, may bring to Remembrance a <HI>Word</HI> heard some while ago, and then it operates. Yea, it may so fall out, as in Joh. IV. 37. <HI>That saying is true, One soweth and another reapeth.</HI> Oh! Let <HI>Parents</HI> be often dropping some <HI>Word of GOD</HI> upon their <HI>Children; In the Morning sow thy Seed; and in the Evening slack not thy Hand;</HI> A long while hence, it may be, af∣ter thou shalt thy self be <HI>sleeping in the Dust,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> that seems to have been left <HI>there,</HI> shall have its Efficacy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seed</HI> you see; But, who the <HI>Sower?</HI> Be sure, The <HI>owner</HI> of the <HI>Seed,</HI> is the principal <HI>sower</HI> of the <HI>Seed.</HI> It is the <HI>Word</HI> of CHRIST; and it is He that <HI>sows</HI> it. The <HI>second Adam</HI> is the <HI>Blessed Husbandman,</HI> who <HI>Tills the Ground,</HI> and <HI>sows</HI> the <HI>Field which the Lord has blessed.</HI> But then he has his <HI>Ministers,</HI> who do the part of <HI>Sowers</HI> under Him. These are they who may say, as in 1. Cor. IX. 11. <HI>We have sown unto you spiritual Things.</HI></P>
<P>May our GOD Help us, That we may bring you none but the <HI>pure Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word;</HI> Pick and
<PB N="27" REF="002905_0032_0FE691CD32E1C1C0"/>Cleanse the <HI>Seed</HI> in our <HI>Studies;</HI> and not bring you the <HI>Chaff</HI> or <HI>Husks</HI> of our own <HI>Brains;</HI> or the per∣nicious <HI>Darnel</HI> of unscriptural <HI>Error.</HI></P>
<P>May we bring you also the <HI>whole Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word;</HI> And so honestly dispose of the <HI>Seed</HI> com∣mitted unto us, that we may balk no <HI>Truth,</HI> but be able to say, <HI>I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Counsel of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But may we still see to it, that we <HI>Preach</HI> and <HI>Sowe</HI> to the Advantage of our <HI>Master:</HI> And all we do be aimed at this; That we may see you <HI>Glorifying</HI> of our Lord, and <HI>Glorified</HI> with him.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>Brethren, Pray for us.</HI></P>
<P>The rather, in as much as our Calling is no <HI>easy Calling.</HI> The <HI>Sweat</HI> of the <HI>Brain,</HI> not more easy than the <HI>Sweat</HI> of the <HI>Brow.</HI> The Calling of an <HI>Husbandman</HI> is a <HI>painful Calling.</HI> That Man is not worthy the Name of a <HI>Minister,</HI> who takes not as much pains as an <HI>Husbandman.</HI> Our Name, is Mat. IX. 38. that of, <HI>Labourers.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you see the <HI>Sower</HI> with the <HI>Field.</HI> But I know not how to dismiss this matter, without some <HI>Reflection</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>Confess, O People that have the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD offered unto you, how <HI>Necessary</HI> it is, that this Word should be dispensed unto you. It is threat∣ned as a very dismal Desolation; Jer. I. 20. <HI>I will cut off the Sower.</HI> In what a deplorable Condition were you, if the <HI>sowing</HI> should utterly fail? If you should have no <HI>Preaching,</HI> you would have no <HI>sowing;</HI> and if <HI>This</HI> fail, you soon fall under the Terriblest <HI>Famine</HI> in the world; Even That; Amos. VIII. 11. <HI>Not a Famine of Bread, but of hearing the words of the Lord.</HI> What, what will be∣come of your <HI>starved</HI> Souls, if the <HI>Bread of Life</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002905_0033_0FE691CD533BEF58"/>should be deny'd you? The <HI>Bread of Life</HI> will be gone, when there are none to <HI>sowe</HI> the <HI>Seed of Life.</HI> A Country without the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD and CHRIST and <HI>Salvation</HI> in it, is a rueful Country: 'Tis all <HI>Winter</HI> there, They see no <HI>Seed time;</HI> They are <HI>Destroy'd for the lack of Knowledge.</HI> Oh! <HI>If the Gospel be hid from us, we are a lost People!</HI> But ours is not such a <HI>Country.</HI> Our GOD has <HI>given his Word</HI> unto us; <HI>Praise the Lord!</HI> And give to his <HI>Word,</HI> a <HI>Fruitful Entertainment.</HI></P>
<P>We read of a Time when, and a Place where, a <HI>Cab of Doves Dung</HI> was rated at <HI>Five pieces of Sil∣ver.</HI> What we render <HI>Doves Dung,</HI> I suppose, may mean rather the <HI>Offals,</HI> or the <HI>Refuse,</HI> of the <HI>Corn,</HI> which they commonly gave to their <HI>Pigeons;</HI> That <HI>Coarse Grain,</HI> which was the vile <HI>Remains</HI> and <HI>Sweepings</HI> of the <HI>Floor.</HI> Surely, 'Tis a better sort of <HI>Seed,</HI> that is generally cast upon the Fields in this Country; 'Tis the <HI>finest of the Wheat;</HI> where is there what exceeds it?</P>
<P>But then, <HI>Receive</HI> it Readily. <HI>Retain</HI> it Faith∣fully. <HI>Improve</HI> it Suitably. In all the <HI>Fruits of the Spirit,</HI> make suitable Returns to Heaven for it. It was once a sad Complaint; <HI>Master, Didst not thou sowe good Seed? Whence then are these Tares?</HI> Oh! Let there not be cause of this Complaint; <HI>Lord, A good Seed has been cast upon us: But whence then, this Profaneness, this Intemperance, this Dishonesty? Whence these Abominable Impieties and Iniquities?</HI> GOD forbid, that such <HI>Briars</HI> and <HI>Thorns</HI> ever should be found in a <HI>Soyl,</HI> that a good <HI>Seed</HI> has been <HI>sown</HI> upon!</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Heart</HI> of Man under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, proves a very <HI>Different Soyl</HI> to the <HI>Seed</HI> that is cast
<PB N="29" REF="002905_0034_0FE691D3A8DC8E58"/>upon it: Various are the <HI>Effects</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD has upon them that hear it. For the Illustration and Confirmation of this Observation, our SAVIOUR has described the <HI>Hearers</HI> of his <HI>Word,</HI> and the <HI>Effects</HI> of it on them that <HI>Hear</HI> it, under the Figure of no less than <HI>Four Soyls:</HI> Whereof <HI>Three</HI> disappoint the <HI>Husbandman,</HI> but the <HI>Fourth</HI> proves as he would have it. And indeed, among them that hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, it is well if <HI>One in Three</HI> entertain it as they ought to do. There is an <HI>High-way Ground,</HI> and a <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> and a <HI>Thorny Ground,</HI> and at last a <HI>Good Ground,</HI> which the <HI>Seed</HI> is cast upon. Each of these will now call for a Successive Contemplation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The <HI>High-way Ground.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are informed, First, That some who hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, prove like an <HI>High-way Ground,</HI> when the <HI>Seed</HI> is cast upon it: An <HI>High-way Ground,</HI> which being much <HI>Troden</HI> on, the <HI>Fowls of Heaven</HI> do <HI>steal away the Seed</HI> that falls upon it. In the Land of <HI>Judaea,</HI> their <HI>Corn-fields</HI> usually had <HI>High-ways</HI> thorough them; and this is what the Discourse of our SAVIOUR is Allusive to. Our SAVIOUR has thus explained it; <HI>These are they by the High-way; where the Word is sown, but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the Word that was sown in their Hearts.</HI> When he elsewhere says of this Hearer, <HI>He hears the Word, and understandeth it not,</HI> the Greek Word ra∣ther imports an <HI>Unattentive</HI> Hearer, than the sim∣ply <HI>Ignorant:</HI> Or one whose Heart will not <HI>go with</HI> what he hears. It is a <HI>Carless Hearer</HI> of the
<PB N="30" REF="002905_0035_0FE691D3C81BD9F8"/><HI>Word,</HI> whose <HI>Guise</HI> and whose <HI>Fate,</HI> is to be now set before us. O my Hearers, let it not at this very Instant have an unhappy Commentary a∣mong ourselves; But, I beseech you, <HI>Carefully,</HI> and with <HI>Earnest Heed,</HI> give Ear to this Admoni∣tion of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>The Devils, like the Fowls of the Air, come and catch the Word of GOD our SAVIOUR, from those Hearers, whose Hearts are like the HIGH-WAY GROUND, where that good Seed of the Word is trod under Foot.</HI></P>
<P>We have now such Instructions as these, to be thankful for.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Devils,</HI> which fly about this <HI>Air,</HI> under the command of a <HI>Prince</HI> and a <HI>wicked One,</HI> who is called SATAN, are very fitly Resembled unto the <HI>Fowls of the Air.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Cursed Spirits,</HI> are called, Psal. XCI. 3. <HI>Fowlers:</HI> Because they Ensnare, and they De∣stroy the poor Children of Men, as the Children of Men themselves, do the silly <HI>Birds,</HI> which they have a design upon. A seasonable and profitable <HI>Meditation</HI> for any of you, when you are upon that <HI>Recreation.</HI> But then, they are <HI>Fowls</HI> too. The <HI>Fowls</HI> and the <HI>Devils</HI> have indeed their lodging in the same Element. The <HI>Devils</HI> are, Eph II. 2. <HI>The Power,</HI> or Army, <HI>of the Air.</HI> And, Eph. VI. 12. <HI>Spiritual Wickednesses</HI> in those <HI>High Places.</HI> Here these <HI>Unclean Birds</HI> will be Neasted, until our Lord JESUS CHRIST shall descend with flaming Fire, to make this <HI>Air</HI> become the Seat for that <HI>City of
<PB N="31" REF="002905_0036_0FE691D53945F8D8"/>GOD,</HI> where his <HI>Raised Saints</HI> will be gathered un∣to him.</P>
<P>Can we tell the Number of the <HI>Fowls?</HI> There are more than Five Hundred species of them; The Individuals are Thousands, and Myriads, and Millions; How Numberless? But the Num∣ber of the <HI>Devils,</HI> may, for ought we know, ex∣ceed that of the <HI>Fowls.</HI> It seems, that a Demon who molested one poor Man in the Gospel, had no less than a <HI>Legion</HI> at hand under his Ordering, like so many <HI>French Dragoons,</HI> to seize him and vex him.</P>
<P>What can emulate the <HI>Swiftness</HI> of the <HI>Fowls?</HI> Yea, but the <HI>Eagles hastening to the Prey</HI> are not so <HI>swift,</HI> as those <HI>Fowls</HI> of a stronger Wing, the <HI>De∣vils,</HI> when coming down to prey upon us. The <HI>Devils</HI> will convey themselves from one side of the Earth to the other, doubtless, as fast as the Earth it self can whirl about upon its <HI>Axis.</HI> Or as our Lord saw the <HI>Devils</HI> falling like the <HI>Lightening,</HI> why mayn't we suppose 'em flying like the very <HI>Lightning?</HI></P>
<P>Finally; The most <HI>mischievous Fowls,</HI> are there∣in an Emblem of the <HI>Devils,</HI> who delight in <HI>Mis∣chief.</HI> What are the <HI>Devils</HI> but <HI>Birds of prey?</HI> The Bible calls them, <HI>Foul Spirits,</HI> and, <HI>filthy and hate∣ful Birds.</HI> When we read, Mat. XIII. 19. of, The <HI>Wicked One catcheth away, what is sown in the Heart,</HI> there is a Greek word used, which implies, that the <HI>wicked One</HI> is an horrid <HI>Harpye</HI> to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>But, O ye <HI>Souls in peril;</HI> since you have such perillous <HI>Fowls of the Air</HI> continually fluttering a∣bout you; Hearken, Hearken to the kind Calls of
<PB N="32" REF="002905_0037_0FE691D55BC4DF18"/>your SAVIOUR; Hear the kind <HI>Cloques</HI> of such a gracious Protector; Mat. XXIII. 37. <HI>How often would I have gathered thy Children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Hen gather∣eth her Chickens under her Wings!</HI> Oh! Get under this protection, by the flights of a lively Faith unto it!</P>
<P N="2">II. Wherever the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is dispensed, there the <HI>Devils</HI> will immediately come to <HI>steal</HI> the good <HI>Seed</HI> of that <HI>Word,</HI> from the Hearts which it is cast upon.</P>
<P>Be advised of this, O worshippers of GOD; That in whatever <HI>Exercise of Religion</HI> you are en∣gaged, the <HI>Devils</HI> will with some <HI>Temptation</HI> there immediately fall upon you. Even in the <HI>House</HI> of GOD, and where the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is dispensed, we must look to meet with <HI>Devils;</HI> and when the <HI>Sons of GOD</HI> come to <HI>present themselves before the Lord, Satan will also come among them.</HI> You are to <HI>Watch</HI> against your never-weary, never-sleeping <HI>Adversary,</HI> not only in your <HI>Business,</HI> and in your <HI>Travelling,</HI> and in your friendly <HI>Conversations,</HI> but in your <HI>Devotions</HI> too.</P>
<P>Be yet more particularly advised of it; That the <HI>Devils</HI> are very particularly desirous, to hinder that good <HI>Seed,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, from taking <HI>Root</HI> in your Hearts. The <HI>Word of the Kingdom,</HI> tends to rescue the Souls of Men from the <HI>power of Darkness,</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom of Satan,</HI> and so to <HI>Translate</HI> them into the <HI>Kingdom of the Son</HI> of GOD. It is the Word of a SAVIOUR: It is the <HI>Gospel of our Salvation.</HI> The <HI>Devils</HI> are grievously distur∣bed at the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD; It gives 'em a fright∣ful <HI>Alarum;</HI> They are afraid lest it prove the
<PB N="33" REF="002905_0038_0FE691360BC0F4F8"/><HI>Power of GOD unto the Salvation</HI> of them that sit under it; They suspect the losing of some Slave or other from their <HI>Empire,</HI> by the verticordious Power of it. They surmise, the <HI>Prey</HI> will be <HI>taken from the Mighty,</HI> and the <HI>Lawful Captive be deliver∣ed.</HI> The <HI>Salvation</HI> of <HI>Sinners,</HI> is a <HI>Vexation</HI> of <HI>Devils.</HI> Their <HI>Malice</HI> cannot bear it, that while they are <HI>Damned,</HI> any of Mankind should be <HI>Saved.</HI> Our <HI>Heaven</HI> adds Oyl to the Flame of the <HI>Hell,</HI> from whence the <HI>Smoke of their Torment ascends for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>And then, finally, Be advised of This; There are many <HI>ways,</HI> by which the <HI>Devils</HI> do <HI>catch up</HI> the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> when your Hearts have it falling upon them.</P>
<P>What these <HI>Destroyers</HI> of Souls, and <HI>Hinderers</HI> of all that is Good, would be at, is, To spoil our <HI>At∣tention</HI> to the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD and SAVIOUR But how is it, that the <HI>Enemy does This!</HI></P>
<P>They do it, by injecting of Impertinent and Unseasonable <HI>Thoughts</HI> of <HI>other Things</HI> into our Hearts, when we should be <HI>Thinking</HI> on the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD. What is the <HI>way of the Serpent on the Rock</HI> in this, and how 'tis that the <HI>Devils</HI> convey Thoughts into our Minds; This is a <HI>Thing too wonderful</HI> for me; 'tis <HI>what I know not.</HI> But the <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> is what I <HI>know,</HI> and am certain of. The <HI>Devils</HI> are <HI>Wandring Spirits,</HI> and they have a Faculty to throw <HI>Wandring Thoughts</HI> into our <HI>Spi∣rits.</HI> When the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is cast upon us, it may be some <HI>Filthy Thoughts,</HI> or some <HI>Angry Thoughts,</HI> or, at least, some <HI>worldly Thoughts,</HI> will then be cast in, and carry away our Minds from what they should be upon. Our GOD may say
<PB N="34" REF="002905_0039_0FE691362868BDE8"/>of us; Ezek. XXXIII. 31. <HI>They sit before thee as my People, they hear thy Words, but their Heart goeth af∣ter their Covetousness.</HI> While our GOD is tendering his <HI>Word</HI> unto us, the <HI>Devils</HI> throw in the <HI>Images</HI> of a <HI>Bargain,</HI> or a <HI>Journey,</HI> and some contrivance for our <HI>worldly Advantage,</HI> or, perhaps, what is yet more <HI>Base</HI> than so: And while we think on these things, the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> is picked away most unaccountably. If the Messenger of GOD, should suddenly ask of some, <HI>What was the last Seed of the word cast upon you?</HI> They must with Confu∣sion own, <HI>I did not Regard what it was.</HI> Thus the <HI>Devils</HI> have snatched it away. <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> make the <HI>Word</HI> of our SAVIOUR to be <HI>in vain</HI> dispen∣sed unto us. O my Hearers, <HI>What are you Thinking on?</HI> If upon Recollection you find, that your Thoughts are at any time gone away from the <HI>word,</HI> whereof you should be more diligent Hear∣ers, think with Horror upon it; <HI>Some Devil is now at work upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Agaid, They do it, by <HI>prejudicing</HI> our Hearts against the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD, or the Dispensers of it. Sometimes, the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>word</HI> itself is not liked. Either the <HI>Proud Men</HI> say to the Pro∣phet, <HI>Thou speakest Falsly.</HI> Or, something in the <HI>manner</HI> of speaking it, is not pleasing. But oftner, 'Tis the <HI>Seeds-Man,</HI> that is not liked. The <HI>Devils</HI> would fain have the <HI>Feet</HI> of them who <HI>Preach the Gospel of Peace,</HI> to be not <HI>Beautiful:</HI> but have <HI>wrong steps</HI> charged upon them, to fill our Minds with <HI>Prejudices</HI> against them. Not only would the <HI>De∣vils</HI> bring the Hearers, to that <HI>Contempt</HI> of those who come unto them, <HI>What is it this Babler says?</HI> But also that <HI>Hatred</HI> of them; 1 King. XXII. 8.
<PB N="35" REF="002905_0040_0FE6913D45D8AC70"/><HI>I hate him.</HI> It is a potent Engine, that the <HI>Devils</HI> have, to take away the <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> from our <HI>Hearts,</HI> when they have made our Hearts to dislike the <HI>Hands</HI> which throw it upon us. 'Tis done sometimes by more <HI>Immediate Suggestions,</HI> which fill the <HI>Hearts</HI> of Men with <HI>Grudges</HI> against those Dis∣pensers of the <HI>Word,</HI> from whom they might o∣therwise have the greatest Benefit.

These <HI>Black birds of Hell,</HI> do mightily prevent the <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> from getting well into the <HI>Hearts</HI> of the poisoned People.

<P>Once more; They do it by making us <HI>Drowsy</HI> and <HI>Sleepy,</HI> when the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD should have the Respects of a wakeful Attention paid unto it. When the best Preacher in the World, was casting the <HI>Seed,</HI> we find one; A&amp;. XX. 9. <HI>Fallen into a deep Sleep.</HI> Who <HI>Rocqued</HI> the <HI>Cradle,</HI> I pray?

But the <HI>Devils</HI> have chea∣ted us thereof, by laying us fast <HI>Asleep,</HI> at the time that they were uttered. Oh! That we were more on our Guard! There may indeed be some <HI>Fee∣bleness</HI> and <HI>Heaviness</HI> of <HI>Constitution,</HI> which may sometimes betray very Godly People into this Miscarriage. The <HI>Spirit</HI> would be <HI>willing</HI> to have it otherwise, and groans under the <HI>Distempered Flesh</HI> which indisposes us. We have a compassionate SAVIOUR, who in this case <HI>pitties</HI> us. At the same time we should not Pardon and Indulge our selves; or show any <HI>Pity</HI> to our own <HI>Irregularity.</HI> But when People can set themselves to <HI>Sleep</HI> in the <HI>Dreadful place,</HI> which <HI>is the House of GOD and the Gate of Heaven;</HI> and make a Trade of <HI>long Naps,</HI> when they are in the <HI>special Presence</HI> of a GOD that <HI>will be sanctified in all them who draw near unto Him;</HI> how poorly is the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> exercised in them! Or can they think, that the great GOD will hold them <HI>Guiltless,</HI> who so <HI>take his Name in Vain?</HI> Awake, my Friends, Awake; And let us Charitably jog, and pull, and <HI>waken</HI> one another; The <HI>Philistines</HI> of Hell are upon you! A <HI>Satanic Opium</HI> is administred unto you, by those Fiends of Darkness; who have a Plot upon you, to deprive you of a <HI>Word,</HI> that might <HI>Save your Souls.</HI> Alas, How many in our Congregations, very sinfully and foolishly snore away their <HI>Sabbaths!</HI> And might, if they were not fast <HI>Asleep,</HI> often hear their SAVIOUR upbraiding of them, <HI>What?</HI>

<P N="3">III. An <HI>Highway Ground</HI> are the <HI>Hearts</HI> of those, who permit the <HI>Devils</HI> to steal the good <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> from them, in their Hearing of it. An Elegant Similitude! For,</P>
<P>The <HI>Seed</HI> that falls on the <HI>Highway,</HI> does not <HI>sink</HI> into the <HI>Earth,</HI> but ly on the top of it. There are Hearers of the <HI>Word,</HI> who are too unmindful of our SAVIOUR's Direction; Luk, IX. 44. <HI>Let these sayings sink down into you.</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> has no more than a <HI>Superficiary Touch</HI> upon them. It may inform their <HI>Heads,</HI> but their <HI>Hearts</HI> are not reach∣ed by it, not moved by it, not changed by it.</P>
<P>Again; The <HI>Seed</HI> that falls on the <HI>Highway,</HI> is not <HI>look'd after.</HI> There are Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> who don't <HI>look after</HI> what has fallen upon them, to see what comes of it; but it is with them accor∣ding to That; Jam. I. 23, 24. <HI>He is an Hearer of the Word, and not a Doer; He goes his way, and straightway forgets.</HI> They do not <HI>Ruminate</HI> on the <HI>Word</HI> they have heard; their <HI>Hearts</HI> don't recall any thing of it; but they carry toward it, as if they had never been concerned with it.</P>
<P>Moreover; <HI>High-ways</HI> are <HI>common Roads;</HI> They are ways that ly <HI>common</HI> and <HI>open</HI> and <HI>obvious</HI> for every Passenger. The <HI>Hearts</HI> of many that hear the <HI>Word,</HI> are not as <HI>Gardens enclosed;</HI> but they are
<PB N="38" REF="002905_0043_0FE691D94C300A78"/>the Walk of <HI>Satan;</HI> the Print of his <HI>Cloven Foot</HI> is to be seen upon them: Nothing, tho' ever so Evil, is kept out of them. For this Cause, the Denomination of the <HI>Gentiies,</HI> who in Matth. XXII. 10. are called, <HI>The High-Way,</HI> may be put upon them.</P>
<P>Lastly; In the <HI>Highways</HI> the <HI>Seed</HI> that is cast by <HI>Hand</HI> is cast under the <HI>Foot;</HI> It is Trampled on. Verily, There are Hearers of the <HI>Word,</HI> of whom we read; Heb. X. 29. <HI>They have trodden under Foot the Son of GFD.</HI> Be sure then, they <HI>Tread un∣der Foot</HI> His <HI>Word;</HI> They <HI>Trample</HI> on the <HI>Command∣ments,</HI> the <HI>Promises,</HI> the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of it. There may this Account be given of them; <HI>They Despise His Word, until the Wrath of the Lord arise against them, and there is no Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot go off this <HI>Highway Ground,</HI> without making at least these Two Remarks upon it.</P>
<P>First. Under whose Malignant Influence, do you think, must they be, that frequently and needlessly <HI>Absent</HI> themselves from the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR, when they might enjoy the Dispensations of it? If it be <HI>Satan</HI> that <HI>steals</HI> the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> from the <HI>Way</HI> on which it falls, doubtless, it must be <HI>Satan,</HI> who <HI>steals</HI> Peo∣ple from the <HI>Way</HI> of the <HI>Seed.</HI> He who does <HI>Catch</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> from us, is he who does <HI>Keep</HI> us from the <HI>Word.</HI> The Jews gave this as a Defini∣tion of a <HI>Bad Neighbour,</HI> Tis, <HI>One who don't come to the Synagogue.</HI> If there be such a <HI>Bad Neighbour</HI> in the Town, we see, what is the <HI>Bad Spirit</HI> that makes him so. It is noted of <HI>Origen,</HI> That in his Vigorous Homilies, he Reproved no Crime so much, as that of <HI>Absence from the Holy Assemblies.</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="002905_0044_0FE6913F6ABED348"/>This Crime I now Reprove, with telling you, whom you serve and please in the committing of it; The <HI>Devils!</HI></P>
<P>It may be, the most Criminal are at this time, <HI>out of Hearing.</HI> Wherefore, let such as wish well to them, carry them home something from the place where they should have been. Ask them to read that awful Scripture; Joh. VIII. 47 <HI>He that is of GOD, hears the Words of GOD; you there∣fore hear them not, because you are not of GOD.</HI> If they plead, They have not <HI>Cloathes</HI> fine enough; Ask them, whether they had not better come with <HI>mean Cloathes,</HI> where they may have the <HI>Garments of Salvation</HI> put upon their Souls, than remain <HI>Wretched, and Miserable, and Poor, and Blind, and Naked,</HI> as they are? Ask them, Whether they must not shortly be shrowded in a <HI>Winding-Sheet,</HI> and their <HI>Naked Souls</HI> will not then wish, that a pretence of <HI>Mean Cloathes</HI> had not kept them a∣mong them that <HI>Hate Instruction.</HI> If they profane∣ly tell you, <HI>They Read a Chapter in</HI> Job: Turn them to Job. XXIII. 12. <HI>I have esteemed the Words of His Mouth more than my Necessary Food.</HI> Ask them, Whether <HI>they</HI> can say so; and what they think will be the portion of them, who can't say so?</P>
<P>Secondly. What is to be done, for our Defence from the <HI>Fowls of the Air?</HI> What, that the Infae∣licity of the <HI>Highway Ground,</HI> may not be ours, in our <HI>Hearing</HI> the Word of our GOD?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>These two Things to be done.</HEAD>
<P>The First; In our <HI>Hearing</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> Oh! let us check the <HI>Roving</HI> of our Mind. Whatever
<PB N="40" REF="002905_0045_0FE691DCCD87F188"/><HI>Improper Thoughts</HI> would press in upon us, chase them away; There is the <HI>Devil</HI> in them! Deal with them as our Patriarch once; Gen. XV. 11. <HI>When the Fowls came down, upon the</HI> Sacrifices, <HI>A∣bram drove them away.</HI> If <HI>Improper Thoughts</HI> go to intrude, or bespeak an Admission, Repel 'em, Re∣fuse 'em, Rebuke 'em; Say, <HI>I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?</HI></P>
<P>The Second; Let our <HI>Hearing</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> be filled with our <HI>Praying</HI> to our Lord. Oh! let such <HI>Echo</HI>'s pass from us; Psal. XXVII. 8. <HI>Seek my Face; My Heart said upon it, Thy Face Lord, I will seek.</HI> Upon the <HI>Mysteries</HI> unfolded, say, <HI>Lord, I accept this, as a Faithful Saying.</HI> Upon <HI>Follies</HI> condem∣ned, say, <HI>Lord, let thy warned Servant be kept from this Folly!</HI> Upon <HI>Duties</HI> propounded, say, <HI>Lord, Help me to do this Duty.</HI> Upon the <HI>Blessings</HI> of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> let your Heart say, <HI>Lord, let this be my portion.</HI> Upon the <HI>Curses</HI> of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> let your Heart say, <HI>Lord, I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> This one PROPOSAL, should be more to you, than a <HI>Golden Wedge of Ophir.</HI> You secure the <HI>Seed</HI> from the <HI>Fowls of the Air,</HI> if it be complied withal.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The <HI>Stony Ground.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are informed, Secondly, That some who hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, prove like a <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> when the <HI>Seed</HI> is cast upon it: A <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> on which if the <HI>Seed</HI> has any Effect, yet it has no lasting ones. Our SAVIOUR thus gives us to <HI>understand the Parable, and the Interpretation; The Words of the wise, and His Dark Sayings,</HI> are by
<PB N="41" REF="002905_0046_0FE6912CD57C1388"/>Himself thus Interpreted. <HI>These are they which are sown,</HI> (that is to say, They that receive the <HI>Seed</HI>) on <HI>Stony Ground, who when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness: And have no Root in themselves, and so endure but for a time; Af∣terward, when Affliction or Persecution ariseth for the words sake, immediately they are offended.</HI> The Suc∣cess of the Gospel <HI>sown</HI> upon Hearts that are like the <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> is, you see, first, very <HI>commend∣able</HI> and comfortable; then, very <HI>miserable</HI> and la∣mentable.</P>
<P>The Admonition to be now prosecuted, is This.</P>
<P><HI>In some Hearers of the word, whose Heart is like the Stony Ground, that Good Seed of the Word may be Re∣ceived with some seeming Faith and Joy; But in a Time of Temptation, they and their Faith and their Joy, do quickly and sadly wither away.</HI></P>
<P>In the Prosecution of it, let these <HI>Instructions</HI> find some Entertainment with you.</P>
<P N="1">I. A <HI>Stony Ground</HI> is that which a <HI>sinful Heart,</HI> may be too justly compared unto. Inheed, the <HI>Heart</HI> of every Man, in his Fallen and Corrupt Nature, is as <HI>hard</HI> as a <HI>Stone; Hard</HI> like the <HI>Ne∣ther Milstone.</HI> And many do by <HI>Custome</HI> add unto that <HI>hardness of Heart,</HI> which is by <HI>Nature</HI> in them. 'Tis called, Ezek. XI. 19. A <HI>Stony Heart.</HI> In a <HI>Stone</HI> there is a close Fastning, and Knitting, and Combining of the parts together, whereby it is made strong to resist, whatever would from with∣out act upon it. Such a <HI>Stone</HI> is this <HI>Heart</HI> of ours, &amp; so does it <HI>Resist,</HI> the Essays of Heaven to work up∣on it. Our GOD may say of us; as in Zech.
<PB N="42" REF="002905_0047_0FE6913F8BB87D00"/>VII. 12. <HI>They made their Hearts hard as an Ada∣mant-Stone, lest they should hear the Law.</HI> No <HI>Stone</HI> can be more <HI>Insensible;</HI> No <HI>Stone</HI> can be more <HI>In∣flexible,</HI> than this wretched <HI>Heart</HI> of ours under all the means of Good that are employ'd upon it. And as we read, Prov. XXVII. 3. <HI>A Stone is Hea∣vy:</HI> Even such also is this <HI>Heart</HI> of ours; There is no <HI>moving</HI> of it. It is as addicted unto the <HI>Earth,</HI> as the <HI>Heavy Stone,</HI> which by its <HI>weight</HI> will de∣scend unto the <HI>Earth.</HI> It will <HI>mind Earthly Things;</HI> and not easily be <HI>moved</HI> from the wickedness of tending to the <HI>Earth</HI> as the <HI>Center</HI> of it. Be sure, a <HI>Stone</HI> is no good Soyl to <HI>Sow</HI> upon. But is our <HI>unfruitful Heart</HI> any better? Tho' the <HI>good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> falls upon it, there is little <HI>good Fruit</HI> commonly obtained of it.</P>
<P>Oh! That we did every one more <HI>know</HI> this <HI>Plague of our own Heart! Feel</HI> thy <HI>Stony Heart,</HI> O serious Penitent. Thy <HI>Feeling</HI> of it, and thy <HI>Groan∣ing</HI> bitterly and grievously under it; <HI>Alas, my hard Heart! My hard Heart!</HI> This would be the first Symptom of the <HI>Hardness</HI> going off. That horri∣ble Disease of the <HI>Stone</HI> in the <HI>Wheel broken at the Cistern,</HI> would not be a greater matter of Horror to us, than the <HI>Stone</HI> in our <HI>Heart,</HI> if the very Es∣sence of the <HI>Stone</HI> did not ly in our not <HI>Feeling</HI> of what we have cause to be most concern'd about.</P>
<P N="2">II. Some Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> whose <HI>Hearts</HI> are like <HI>Stones</HI> under it, yet may with some <HI>Faith</HI> and some <HI>Joy</HI> seem to Receive the <HI>good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> that falls upon them. This is as much as to say, That there are some Dissemblers, (we may call them, <HI>shining Stones</HI>) among the Hearers of the
<PB N="43" REF="002905_0048_0FE6914450816338"/><HI>Word,</HI> who may go a great way in the <HI>Religion</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> calleth for, and yet perish after all. There is not a more lawful Meditation for a Christian to affect himself withal, than This; How far a Man may go in Christianity, and yet after all be found among the False-hearted Hear∣ers of the <HI>Word.</HI> There is no <HI>Grace,</HI> but what may have a <HI>Counterfeit.</HI> A <HI>Stony Heart,</HI> is a <HI>Cheat∣ing</HI> one; 'Tis <HI>Deceitful above all things.</HI> Others, and even ourselves too, may be <HI>deceived</HI> by it. It will out do, even the Spirit that is called, <HI>The De∣ceiver of the Nations.</HI></P>
<P>First; There is a <HI>Faith</HI> which <HI>False-hearted</HI> Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> may pretend unto. We read, Luk. VIII. 13. <HI>For a while they believe.</HI> A True <HI>Justifying Faith</HI> will be for more than <HI>a while;</HI> By its <HI>Uniting</HI> the Beleever to his Redeemer, it brings him into those Hands, from whence nothing ever can pull him away. The meer <HI>Stony Ground</HI> has not this <HI>Faith</HI> growing in it. But there is a <HI>Tem∣porary Faith</HI> may look like a <HI>Justifying Faith;</HI> and meer <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> may have a <HI>Weed,</HI> that shall seem this <HI>Herb of Grace.</HI> A <HI>False-Hearted</HI> Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> may yield some <HI>Assent</HI> unto the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Word:</HI> Which indeed the very <HI>Devils</HI> do, with <HI>Trembling</HI> at it. Yea, he may profess to yield some <HI>Consent</HI> unto it. Every <HI>Baptised</HI> Person is a <HI>Profess'd Servant</HI> of GOD. But, alas, how many under the <HI>Livery</HI> of CHRIST in their <HI>Baptism,</HI> have their Souls <HI>Unbaptised,</HI> Unpurified, Unsanc∣tified. Indeed, if a Man give a Real and Hearty <HI>Consent</HI> unto the <HI>Methods of Grace</HI> in our Salvation by a Glorious CHRIST, such a Man shall be un∣doubtedly Saved and Happy. But a <HI>sincere Consent</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="002905_0049_0FE691446D2864F0"/>is one thing, and a <HI>profess'd Consent</HI> is another. Some do <HI>Profess</HI> to <HI>Consent</HI> unto the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, and yet continue in the <HI>Gall of Bitterness and Bond of Iniquity.</HI> Behold, A Tragical Example; Act. VIII. 13 <HI>Simon himself believed also.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; There is also a <HI>Joy</HI> which <HI>False-hear∣ted</HI> Hearers of the <HI>Word</HI> may attain unto. We read, Mat. XIII. 20. Such an one, <HI>Hears the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it.</HI> There is the <HI>Joy</HI> of a distressed Soul finding in an Alsuffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent CHRIST the Relief of its Distresses; a <HI>Joy</HI> ac∣companied with a bitter and pungent <HI>Grief,</HI> in a <HI>sense</HI> of Sin, as the worst Evil in the World: This is a <HI>Joy</HI> which the meer <HI>Stony Ground</HI> is a stranger to; A <HI>stranger</HI> to <HI>Regeneration</HI> does not <HI>intermeddle</HI> with it. But there is a <HI>Flashy Joy,</HI> which may look very like that <HI>Sacred Joy.</HI> A <HI>False-hearted</HI> Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> may have some <HI>Delight</HI> in the Exercise of <HI>Hearing</HI> itself; may <HI>love to Hear</HI> such a Man. The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had some such atten∣ding on his Ministry. Yea, he may have some <HI>Delight</HI> in some doing of something of what he hears. <HI>John Baptist</HI> had some Followers that were none of the best; of whom it is reported; Joh. V. 35. <HI>Ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his Light.</HI> Many may find it for their Secular Advantage to comply with some things, which they <HI>hear</HI> in the Word of GOD. There are <HI>Loaves!</HI> Thus, at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> very many People were <HI>glad</HI> of that <HI>Word</HI> which decried the Abominations of <HI>Popery.</HI> The Gentry became enriched with <HI>Ab∣bey-lands,</HI> and the Peasants were delivered from the Tyranny of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and were taught how to come at the <HI>Pardon</HI> of their Sins, without being
<PB N="45" REF="002905_0050_0FE69146A1FCAB18"/><HI>Priest-ridden</HI> into cruel <HI>Penances</HI> for it. But accor∣ding to the Ancient Prophecy, <HI>many,</HI> yea, the most, <HI>Cleave to the</HI> Reformation <HI>only with Flatteries;</HI> Their Hearts don't like the Maxims, which it must live upon!</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> that <HI>seem to Re∣joice</HI> it, will meet with a <HI>Time of Temptation,</HI> to <HI>try</HI> whether they have <HI>indeed received</HI> it. We read, Luk. VIII. 13. <HI>A Time of Temptation comes upon them.</HI> When the <HI>Seed</HI> has been <HI>sown</HI> upon the Ground, the <HI>Sun</HI> will be up, and fall with <HI>scorching Beams,</HI> upon it. A fit Emblem of the <HI>Temptation,</HI> which they that <HI>Hear,</HI> and seem to <HI>like,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, must look to meet withal.</P>
<P>First, There will be the more general <HI>Tempta∣tion</HI> of <HI>Adversity,</HI> to try the <HI>sincerity</HI> and <HI>perseverance</HI> of them that seem to Receive the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. We read, Mat. IV. 17. <HI>Affliction ariseth.</HI> Many may have the Vanity to expect little <HI>Affliction,</HI> when their <HI>ways</HI> are <HI>once directed for keeping the sta∣tutes of GOD.</HI> O vain Dream! When our SAVI∣OUR has expressly forewarned us, <HI>In the world ye shall have Tribulation!</HI> But, by <HI>Adversity,</HI> there will be a <HI>Trial</HI> made of us, whether we really Re∣ceive the <HI>word</HI> of GOD as we say, we do. <HI>Self-denial</HI> is what the <HI>word</HI> of GOD in the first place, indispensably calls for; Tis, the <HI>First Lesson</HI> of the <HI>word.</HI> When <HI>Adversity</HI> comes, it lays the <HI>Cross</HI> on us. It is now <HI>Tried,</HI> how we can bear it, and whe∣ther we can patiently <HI>deny</HI> our selves of every thing at the Call and for the sake of, our Lord. If under <HI>Adversity</HI> we suitably, quietly, fruitfully bear the <HI>Cross,</HI> and forego what we must part
<PB N="46" REF="002905_0051_0FE69146C399A950"/>withal; then we have Received the <HI>word</HI> of GOD aright. But if under <HI>Adversity,</HI> we grow weary of serving our Lord, and of waiting on Him, and of sitting under His Discipline; then the <HI>word</HI> of GOD was never well received in our Souls. Oh! that being <HI>Tried we may come forth as Gold;</HI> And by <HI>Learning the statutes</HI> of GOD from it, and be∣coming more f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m in our Adhering, and more full in our Conforming unto them for it, we may find it <HI>Good for us that we have been afflicted.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; There will be the more special <HI>Temp∣tation</HI> of <HI>Persecution,</HI> to try our <HI>sincerity</HI> and <HI>perseve∣rance.</HI> We read, Mat. XIII. 21. <HI>Persecution ariseth because of the Word. Cain</HI>'s Club walks about, unto this very Day; and we have a fair praemonition; <HI>All that will live Godlily in CHRIST JESUS shall suffer Persecution.</HI> Until the second Coming of our great GOD and SAVIOUR, the World will ne∣ver see a Day, wherein a Man may be an <HI>Holy Man,</HI> and suffer nothing for being so. For, <HI>Satan</HI> will not be <HI>Bound,</HI> until the second Coming of the Lord. And until <HI>Satan</HI> be <HI>Bound,</HI> we cannot ima∣gine, that he will cease to give Trouble unto all that <HI>Love the Lord JESUS CHRIST in sincerity.</HI> The <HI>Third Chapter</HI> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> will never cease to operate, until we come to the <HI>Twentieth Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Revelation.</HI> Where the <HI>Persecution</HI> of the <HI>Hand</HI> is Restrained, and wicked Men have not their Tools to work withal, yet the <HI>Persecution</HI> of the <HI>Tongue,</HI> and the Methods to express much <HI>Unkind∣ness,</HI> much <HI>Aversion,</HI> will never fail. But as in the Days of <HI>Ishmael,</HI> even <HI>so it is now.</HI> The genuine Children of GOD, must be <HI>hated,</HI> and <HI>mocked,</HI> and <HI>wronged,</HI> by the <HI>Children of the wicked one.</HI> By this

If we can't bear to be Vilified and Ridiculed, for being strictly Consciencious, we have not yet Received the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. If we had rather commit a <HI>Sin</HI> against the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, than incur a <HI>Scoff</HI> on the score of our keep∣ing the <HI>Word,</HI> Ah! Woful Soul, Thou hast never yet Received it.

<P N="4">IV. <HI>False-hearted</HI> Hearers of the <HI>Word,</HI> will wretchedly <HI>wither,</HI> when <HI>Temptation scorches</HI> them. Not having the <HI>Root</HI> and the <HI>Sap</HI> of a good Prin∣ciple in them, to feed that PIETY which they seem to have, they <HI>wither,</HI> they <HI>wither!</HI> Yea, <HI>while they are yet in their Greenness, and not cut down, they wither before any other Herb: So are the Paths of all that forget GOD, and the Hypocrites hope shall perish.</HI></P>
<P>If it be enquired; What is the <HI>withering</HI> where∣to the Corn of the <HI>Stony Ground</HI> is obnoxious? It must be Answered; It is the <HI>Apostasy</HI> of these <HI>False hearted</HI> ones, thro' prejudice at the <HI>Right ways of the Lord.</HI> In Two of the Evangelists we read, <HI>They are Offended;</HI> In the Third we read, <HI>They fall away.</HI> Tis no rare thing, for <HI>Hypocrites</HI> to prove <HI>Apostates.</HI> Our SAVIOUR had some Disciples,
<PB N="48" REF="002905_0053_0FE6914CF8008088"/>who <HI>went away,</HI> and <HI>walked no more with Him.</HI> The Primitive Churches, had those who <HI>went out from them,</HI> not being truly <HI>of them.</HI> All Ages have Ex∣amples of it.</P>
<P>These <HI>False-hearted</HI> ones often come to a <HI>wither∣ing,</HI> even in their very <HI>Profession.</HI> They Renounce the <HI>Orthodox Faith,</HI> with which they once flourish∣ed in the Field of the Church. Or, if not so, yet instead of standing up for GOD, and CHRIST, and Holiness, they become Formal, Carnal, Insi∣pid Creatures, and <HI>cast off the thing that is Good.</HI></P>
<P>They come to a <HI>withering</HI> in their <HI>Affection.</HI> They <HI>leave their first Love:</HI> Their <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>De∣votions,</HI> to the <HI>Appointments,</HI> to the <HI>Ministers</HI> of GOD, all vanishes; and all their old <HI>Zeal</HI> is ex∣tinguished.</P>
<P>Yea, they come to a <HI>withering</HI> of the <HI>Gifts</HI> that once adorned them. They can't <HI>pray</HI> and <HI>speak</HI> as once they could. Their Parts are so <HI>withered,</HI> that every one may plainly see, <HI>The Man is not what once he was.</HI></P>
<P>And at last it comes to that; Job XXVII. 8. <HI>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when GOD shall take away his Soul?</HI> All the <HI>Seed</HI> cast on the <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> and all the <HI>show</HI> of Good issuing from it, comes to nothing.</P>
<P>Some Reflection must be made upon these things. Tho' the <HI>Stony Ground</HI> yields no <HI>Fruit</HI> unto the <HI>Husbandman,</HI> let us reap some <HI>Fruit</HI> from the <HI>Stony Ground</HI> before we leave it.</P>
<P>Beware, Beware, O my Hearers, that what Im∣pression of <HI>Religion</HI> may have been made upon you, do not <HI>wither</HI> in <HI>Apostasy.</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD has doubtless raised some good <HI>Motions,</HI> &amp; some good
<PB N="49" REF="002905_0054_0FE69150CFF776A0"/><HI>Practices</HI> in many of you.

And tho' it be <HI>Stony Ground</HI> that I have to deal withal, yet we will see what the Mighty <HI>Hammer that breaks the Rocks to pieces,</HI> will do upon it.</P>
<P>First; Tho' you are never such a <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> Yet, Oh! be prevailed withal to beg it of a Gra∣cious GOD, that He would mercifully take away from you the <HI>Heart of Stone.</HI> Is it the <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> that yields nothing but <HI>withering Fruit?</HI> Yet, Oh! Let so much <HI>Fruit</HI> be found upon the most Obsti∣nately <HI>Stony Ground</HI> among you. Go to a Glorious CHRIST, with doleful Complaints about that <HI>hard Heart</HI> of thine; and plead with the Lord His Promise; Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. XXXVI. 26. <HI>I will take away the stony Heart.</HI> Beg it of Him; <HI>Oh! Be it unto me ac∣cording to thy Word!</HI> It may be, He will do this Thing, when thou dost intreat Him to do it for thee. And when this Thing is done, Then, then, thou wilt have a <HI>Fruitful Soul. All things</HI> will then <HI>work together for thy Good.</HI> But, if thy <HI>Heart</HI> must and will remain a <HI>Stone,</HI> GOD will one Day <HI>break</HI> thee in the <HI>place of Dragons!</HI> But then,</P>
<P>Secondly, Be concerned, O you that have the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> falling on you, that it may come to have a good and a deep <HI>Root</HI> within you.
<PB N="50" REF="002905_0055_0FE69150F5883170"/>The <HI>Fruit</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> in the <HI>Stony Ground</HI> perishes, because <HI>he has not Root in himself.</HI> What is the <HI>Root?</HI> It is the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD implanted in the Soul. This is, <HI>The Root of the Matter;</HI> This, <HI>the Root of the Righteous.</HI> May you be <HI>Rooted in the Love of GOD,</HI> then all will be well. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD has taken <HI>Root,</HI> when it gives a Change and a Turn, and a <HI>Godward Biass</HI> to the Soul. But, how to come at this! Assuredly, 'tis obtain'd, yea, 'tis begun, in looking to GOD for it. Oh! <HI>Ask</HI> it of a GOD, who <HI>gives this Wisdom</HI> to them that <HI>Ask</HI> it. And importunately make that supplicati∣on; Psal. CXIX. 80. <HI>Let my Heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</HI> — Be awakened, O Gospellized ones, to <HI>seek it carefully and with Tears,</HI> and Beg it, <HI>O Glorious GOD of all Grace, put thy Fear into me, and fill my Heart with thy Love, and quicken me to live unto thee. Lord, I cannot, I will not let thee go except thou Bless me!</HI> This must be done by one that would not <HI>fail of the Grace of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; I know not how to give over <HI>plowing</HI> on the <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> until I have gained thus far upon my Hearers; Bring your selves to a <HI>Trial,</HI> whether you have under the <HI>good Word</HI> of GOD, ever yet arrived unto that <HI>good Work</HI> of GOD, which is beyond what any meer <HI>Stony Ground</HI> has had the Experience of: Come to a <HI>Trial,</HI> whether the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD has ever yet produced that <HI>Work</HI> in you, which will endure the <HI>Trial;</HI> and which being <HI>Tried</HI> will never <HI>fall away.</HI></P>
<P>If you do not see it with a <HI>Full Assurance</HI> that you are come to this <HI>work,</HI> yea, Oh! that you may <HI>Now</HI> come to it! <HI>Now</HI> in the <HI>Hearing</HI> of it!
<PB N="51" REF="002905_0056_0FE69157B7EEE8A0"/>You will do so, if your <HI>Hearts</HI> fall in with the <HI>work,</HI> and <HI>Now</HI> come into the <HI>Acts</HI> which will demon∣strate it.</P>
<P>For your Help in this weighty Case, and that I may assist the Intentions of a SELF-EXAMI∣NATION, I will offer you a brief Model for it, which is Transcribed from the VITALIA, of one <HI>Travelling to Zion,</HI> with <HI>his Face thitherward,</HI> lothe to mistake his <HI>way to the City</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>It is This;</P>
<Q><P>Am I one who shall <HI>ascend into the Hill of the Lord, and stand in His Holy place?</HI></P>
<P>Most certainly, I am in a state of Safety for Eternity, and the <HI>Good Work</HI> of GOD is begun upon me, if I can thus declare before Him.</P>
<P>O my <HI>Glorious GOD,</HI> My LOVE unto Thee, such as it is, disposes me, to a Chusing of it, and a Closing with it, as my Highest End and Wish and Satisfaction, <HI>To be and to do what thou mayst with Delight look down upon.</HI> If I may be a <HI>grate∣ful Spectacle</HI> unto Thee, and an Object wherein Thou mayst be <HI>Gratified</HI> with the Beholding of what Thou hast brought me to, I ask for no more; <HI>This is all my Salvation and all my Desire.</HI> The Thoughts of this <HI>Felicity,</HI> fill me with a <HI>Joy unspeakaqle and full of Glory;</HI> They do so, tho' I should lay aside the Views of <HI>Gains to my self</HI> in the Contemplation. For this Cause, I would for ever Abhor and Avoid the <HI>Sin</HI> which I know to be <HI>Displeasing</HI> unto Thee; And in a perpetual <HI>Respect unto all they Commandments,</HI> I would seek the <HI>Things that please</HI> Thee. Yea, I am in a continual Struggle, to be pleased with whatever shall be pleasing unto Thee, and have my <HI>Will</HI> swallowed up in Thine.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="002905_0057_0FE69157DCF5F890"/>
In order to <HI>This,</HI> and that the Blessed GOD may have <HI>Delight</HI> in me, I do by FAITH make my Flight unto a Glorious CHRIST, and Beg and Hope to be <HI>found him Him.</HI> Distress'd with a Sense of the Condition, which my Fall from GOD in the <HI>First Adam,</HI> has brought me into, I fly to my JESUS, as to the <HI>Second Adam,</HI> in whom GOD has bidden me to look for a <HI>Plente∣ous Redemption;</HI> and I desire to be comprehend∣ed in that <HI>Covenant</HI> which my SAVIOUR has made with His Eternal FATHER, on the be∣half of His Chosen People. O my GOD, I pre∣sent before Thee, the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of thy JESUS, that so <HI>Expiation</HI> being thereby made for my Of∣fences, Thou mayst for the sake <HI>Thereof</HI> be Re∣conciled unto me. I present before Thee, the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of thy JESUS, as my only Plea, that He to whom I am United, having fulfilled thy Law, I may for the sake <HI>Thereof</HI> be Justified before thee. And I Consent, and I Entreat, and with a comfortable Perswasion I expect, That my SAVIOUR should with His Good SPIRIT so take Possession of me, as to <HI>Live</HI> and <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Work</HI> in me, and be in me a <HI>Principle</HI> for Living unto GOD, and bring me to be all that an <HI>Holy Redeemer</HI> would have me to be.</P>
<P>And now, with a serious REPENTANCE, I Confess and Bewail the many <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> wherein I have <HI>denied the GOD that is Above;</HI> and especially the <HI>Fountain of Sin</HI> with me, in an <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>desperately Wicked.</HI> And, my GOD, I heartily give Thanks unto Thee, for all the <HI>Bitter</HI> Dispensations of thy Providence, which <HI>Embitter</HI> my <HI>Sin</HI> unto me. Yea, That my <HI>Re∣pentance</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="002905_0058_0FE69159E1572418"/>may be carried on unto its <HI>perfect Work,</HI> I heartily submit unto all the Methods, tho' <HI>for the present,</HI> they shou'd be <HI>not Joyous but Grievous</HI> ones, that thy <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> may take for to accomplish it.</P></Q>
<P>Having said thus much, at present I need say no more, to find out what <HI>Ground</HI> I am <HI>sowing</HI> up∣on. You cease to be <HI>Stony Ground,</HI> from the Mo∣ment that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD enters thus far into you. Oh! That <HI>This</HI> may be the Moment! Oh!

<HEAD>The <HI>Thorny Ground.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are informed, Thirdly; That some who hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, prove like a <HI>Thorny Ground,</HI> when the <HI>Seed</HI> is cast upon it: A <HI>Thorny Ground,</HI> in which the <HI>Seed</HI> is <HI>choked</HI> at such a rate, as to de∣feat the Effects that are proposed for it. Our SAVIOUR thus Interprets this Article of the Pa∣rable; <HI>These are they which are sown,</HI> (or, do receive the Seed) <HI>among Thorns; such as hear the Word, and the Cares of this World and the Deceitfulness of Riches, and the Lusts of other things entring in choke the Word, and it becometh unfruitful.</HI> The Sin of our Father <HI>Adam</HI> has brought that Malediction on the <HI>Earth</HI> out of which he was taken; <HI>Thorns it shall bring forth unto thee.</HI> So, <HI>Spinas ac Tribulos, Maledictum parturit Arvum.</HI> And indeed, there is now no part of old <HI>Adam</HI>'s World, which has not <HI>Thorns</HI> enough to render it uneasy to us. But the worst sort of <HI>Thorns</HI> are those whereof the second <HI>Adam</HI> has now advised us: And whereof, let us now take this Admonition.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="002905_0059_0FE6915A0250A6C0"/>
<HI>The Things of this World, and the Lusts of Men after these Things, are those Thorns, which do often Choak and Kill and Spoil the Efficacy which that Seed of Grace, the Word of GOD should have upon them.</HI></P>
<P>We read, Prov. XXVI 9. <HI>At a Thorn goes up in∣to the Hand of a Drunkard so is a Parable in the Mouth of Fools.</HI> They had no <HI>Needles,</HI> but used <HI>Thorns</HI> in∣stead of <HI>Needles.</HI> A <HI>Drunken</HI> Man going to use a <HI>Needle,</HI> he misapplied it; he sticks the <HI>Needle</HI> into his <HI>Hand</HI> instead of the <HI>Cloth;</HI> he wounds himself with the <HI>Needle</HI> instead of doing what should be done. 'Tis to be hoped, we shall not now so misapply what we read of the <HI>Thorns</HI> in the <HI>Parable,</HI> that it will be a <HI>Parable in the Hand of Fools.</HI></P>
<P>Let us use it as GOD shall Assist us.</P>
<P>And, here, first, It is Remarkable: How con∣trary the <HI>World</HI> and the <HI>Word</HI> are to one another! <HI>How Readest thou?</HI> — Jam. IV. 4. <HI>The Friend∣ship of this World is Enmity to GOD. The World,</HI> since the Fall of Man, is very much under the Management and Government of, <HI>Our Adversary the Devil.</HI> And the depraved <HI>Heart</HI> of Man since the Fall, is very much indisposed for making such a right use of <HI>This World,</HI> as may be for the Ho∣nour of GOD. Nor has GOD laid up our <HI>Chief Happiness,</HI> in the Enjoyment of <HI>This World.</HI> No, 'Tis another and a better <HI>World,</HI> wherein alone we may hope to be <HI>Happy.</HI> Now the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR, is to prepare us for <HI>That World;</HI> And therefore it is to Turn us, and Wean us, and Alienate us from <HI>this present Evil World.</HI> Hence it
<PB N="55" REF="002905_0060_0FE6915E71E33D80"/>comes to pass, that the <HI>World</HI> and the <HI>Word,</HI> are forever clashing with one another; And, <HI>If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</HI> If this <HI>World</HI> have our <HI>Hearts,</HI> 'tis very cer∣tain the <HI>Word</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f GOD cannot have them. If the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD prevail upon us, 'tis very certain, our contempt of this <HI>World</HI> will be proportionably prevalent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Behold, the grand <HI>Choak-word,</HI> where∣by the Efficacy of the <HI>Word</HI> upon the Souls of Men is forever damnified. <HI>My Hearers,</HI> let these Thoughts be awful to you.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Lusts</HI> of Men after the Things of <HI>This World,</HI> are like <HI>Thorns</HI> to the Souls of Men, that suffer themselves to be <HI>overgrown</HI> with such En∣cumbrances upon them. An <HI>Heart</HI> full of <HI>Lusts,</HI> is a <HI>Ground</HI> full of <HI>Thorns.</HI> Those which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD calls, <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> are <HI>woful Thorns</HI> to the Minds of Men, that are under the Enchantments of them.</P>
<P>First; <HI>Thorns</HI> do <HI>grow of themselves</HI> where they <HI>grow.</HI> 'Tis here said, <HI>The Thorns sprung up!</HI> 'Tis not said, That any one <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wed</HI> these <HI>Thorns.</HI> And <HI>worldly Lusts;</HI> They are of a <HI>Spontaneous Growth</HI> in our <HI>Hearts.</HI> Won't they arise of <HI>themselves,</HI> Ap∣pear of <HI>themselves,</HI> Flou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh of <HI>themselves,</HI> in us? Yes, verily; They are <HI>Natural</HI> to us. We find; Gen. VI 5 <HI>Every imagination of the Thoughts of the Heart of Man, is only Evil continually.</HI> Our <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> are not the Fruits of meer <HI>Imitation.</HI> But are in us, as Rapacity is in a <HI>Wolf,</HI> which is born Rapacious, and will devour a <HI>Sheep,</HI> tho' he has never seen one devoured before. They would quickly show themselves, tho' there were no sin∣ful
<PB N="56" REF="002905_0061_0FE691DF651E8488"/><HI>Examples,</HI> or <HI>Instructions</HI> to <HI>show</HI> us the way of them. There is no need of pains for the <HI>Teaching</HI> of Children to be wicked. They will soon enough be <HI>self-taught,</HI> for the <HI>Drinking in of Iniquity like unto Water.</HI></P>
<P>Again; What are the <HI>Thorns</HI> on the <HI>Earth,</HI> but the Fruits of the <HI>Curse.</HI> Possibly, there would have been <HI>Thorns,</HI> if Man had not finned: They may be <HI>serviceable</HI> to us. But the <HI>super-abounding</HI> of <HI>Thorns,</HI> This is most certainly from the Wrath∣ful <HI>Curse</HI> of GOD, which Mans Hunger after For∣bidden Fruit has brought upon him. It is a Threatening upon a <HI>Vineyard</HI> in ill Terms with Heaven, <HI>There shall come up Briars and Thorns in it.</HI> But, Oh! What a <HI>Curse</HI> from GOD, is there upon us, in the <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> which our Hearts are pos∣sess'd withal! I tell you truly, a Man cannot be more <HI>Cursed,</HI> and more <HI>Damned,</HI> than by being ut∣terly given up unto them; and under such a dis∣pensation as That; Psal. LXXXI. 12. <HI>I gave them up unto the Lusts of their own Heart.</HI> A Soul over∣spred and overwhelm'd with the <HI>Thorns</HI> of <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> is in a dismal Case: And the Soul has the <HI>Thunder</HI> of GOD <HI>cursing</HI> of it, unto an Extremity, when it is under the power of them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>Thorns</HI> in the <HI>Field,</HI> are they <HI>profitable?</HI> No, they are <HI>pernicious,</HI> if thy are <HI>prevailing</HI> there. Can you <HI>Feed</HI> on <HI>Thorns;</HI> or <HI>Build</HI> with <HI>Thorns;</HI> or, will <HI>Thorns</HI> be a lasting <HI>Fuel</HI> for you? No, you call them, as the Bible does, <HI>Grieving Thorns.</HI> And <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> I pray, what are they good for? It is demanded, Rom. VI. 21. <HI>What Fruit have ye of those things?</HI> Oh! Be sensible, that <HI>Sin</HI> is good for nothing in the World. Its <HI>works</HI> are <HI>unfruitful
<PB N="57" REF="002905_0062_0FE6915E94CEACE8"/>works of Darkness. Good!</HI> Nay, <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> are forever <HI>mischievous</HI> Things. They are justly styled, <HI>Foolish and Hurtful Lusts.</HI> They <HI>War against our Souls.</HI> Yea, O Man, If thou hadst not a <HI>Dead Soul</HI> within thee, the <HI>Desires of thy Flesh and of thy Mind</HI> there, would give thee as much Fiery Torment and Anguish as if so many <HI>Thorns</HI> were stuck into thee.</P>
<P>Fourthly; When the <HI>Thorns</HI> cover our <HI>Fields,</HI> 'tis our <HI>Sloth</HI> which is to be blamed for suffering of it. The Man dwells, <HI>At the sign of the Sluggards Field,</HI> who indulges them. <HI>I went by the Field of the Slothful, and lo, It was all overgrown with Thorns.</HI> And, What shall be said of the <HI>Heart</HI> which has <HI>Worldly Lusts</HI> permitted and prevailing in it? That <HI>Heart</HI> is, <HI>The Field of the slothful.</HI> When the <HI>Israel∣ites</HI> allowed and savoured the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> and thro' <HI>Idleness</HI> forbore the Extirpation of them, GOD said unto them; J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh. XXIII. 13. <HI>Know for a cer∣tainty, They shall be Thorns in your Eyes.</HI> This you may <HI>Know for a certainty;</HI> Men might, with the Blessing of GOD, very much Extirpate <HI>Worldly Lusts</HI> out of their Souls; Tis from their own <HI>sloth∣fulness in the Business</HI> of <HI>Mortification,</HI> that these Things that should appear as <HI>Thorns in their Eyes,</HI> are so swarming in them.</P>
<P>Filthly. In <HI>Thorns</HI> we see <HI>Disappointments</HI> to <HI>Ex∣pectations.</HI> Tis a Proverb for those that are. <HI>Dis∣appointed, They Reap Thorns.</HI> The World is full of <HI>Disappointments;</HI> There are <HI>Disappointments</HI> that vex us, in all the Concerns, all the Affairs, and all the <HI>Expectations</HI> of <HI>This World.</HI> Whence are these <HI>Disappointments?</HI> They are our <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> which procure them unto us. Tis <HI>They,</HI> which
<PB N="58" REF="002905_0063_0FE69161DE22AD08"/>upon a <HI>Recollection</HI> brings us to that; Eccl. I. 2. <HI>Vanity of Vanities, Vanity of Vanities, All is Vanity.</HI> Our <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> impose upon us, what our SA∣VIOUR calls, <HI>The deceitfulness of Riches.</HI> They promise us a notable <HI>Harvest</HI> of Satisfaction, from this and that Undertaking or Fruition. But they <HI>Deceive</HI> us; To our <HI>Vexation,</HI> we are <HI>Disappointed</HI> of the promised <HI>Satisfaction;</HI> The Things from which we hoped it, are <HI>Things that satisfy not;</HI> There are <HI>Thorns</HI> in the <HI>Harvest;</HI> They make up the <HI>Harvest.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly; <HI>Thorns</HI> are an <HI>Obstruction</HI> to <HI>Fruitfulness;</HI> The Soil that is filled with them, <HI>yields no Fruit:</HI> The <HI>Thorns</HI> do suck out the Moisture, which the more desirable <HI>Seed</HI> called for. You are aware who said, <HI>Sow not among Thorns.</HI> Our <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> do us this Damage; They render our <HI>Hearts</HI> a Soyl, which the Good <HI>Seed</HI> of the Gospel, is <HI>un∣fruitfully</HI> cast upon. Our <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> engross that <HI>Consideration,</HI> which the Gospel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST should be entertained withal. It is di∣rected; 1 Pet. II. 1, 2. <HI>Lay them aside, and desire the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</HI> If we do not <HI>lay them aside,</HI> or are not willing to be delivered from them, the <HI>Word</HI> will have no <HI>growth</HI> in our Souls.</P>
<P>O you that <HI>serve diverse Lusts;</HI> How can you bear to have such <HI>Thorns</HI> continually harassing of you? Methinks, we should be as uneasy as they that <HI>sit upon Thorns,</HI> or as they that lie down on a <HI>Bed of Thorns,</HI> till we are delivered from the <HI>Lusts</HI> of <HI>Indwelling Sin.</HI> O <HI>wretched ones that we are; who shall deliver us?</HI></P>

II.

The Opportunities for <HI>Hearing,</HI> especially at the <HI>Lectures,</HI> which are set up, that they may not go too many Days together without the <HI>Bread,</HI> which <HI>strengthens the Heart of Man,</HI> these are shamefully neglected, because like <HI>Martha,</HI> we are <HI>careful and troubled about may things.</HI> Or, These Things hin∣der People from <HI>Heeding</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, when they <HI>Hear</HI> it. GOD may say of them, <HI>They sit be∣fore thee as my People, and they hear thy words; but their Heart goeth after their Covetousness.</HI> Or, These Things hinder People from <HI>Doing</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, tho' they <HI>Heed</HI> it. So, <HI>They ihat will be Rich, fall into Temptation, and are drowned in Perdition.</HI> But, where is the Fault of all this? It is not in the <HI>Things</HI> themselves: The Things of <HI>This World</HI> are <HI>Good Things,</HI> when they be not abused. No; The Fault is in those <HI>Lusts,</HI> by which our Hearts are Inordinately carried out after these Things. Our SAVIOUR having rank'd the <HI>Thorns</HI> into Three Classes, <HI>The Cares of this World,</HI> and <HI>The Deceitful∣ness of Riches,</HI> and, <HI>The Lusts of other Things,</HI> I find an Invitation to rank my Hearers, into Three Orders, and bring the Solemn Warnings of GOD unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="002905_0065_0FE6916802271A08"/>
First. There are <HI>Worldly Lusts,</HI> more peculiar to <HI>Poor People,</HI> which hinder the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD from having a good Effect, especially upon that fort of People. The <HI>Cares</HI> that lie upon the Hearts of these, are like <HI>Thorns</HI> painfully <HI>piercing</HI> of them; and these <HI>Cares</HI> confound them. There is a <HI>Pru∣dent Care</HI> about the Things of this World, which is a <HI>Lawful Care.</HI> But then, there is an <HI>Excessive,</HI> a <HI>Distracting,</HI> an <HI>Unlawful Care, How to Live,</HI> by which the <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>poor People</HI> especially, are em∣bittered, and their Souls endangered. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD obliges Men to a <HI>Great Care</HI> on that <HI>Great Point, What shall I do to be saved?</HI> But the <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>This World,</HI> confines their Thoughts unto that o∣ther Question; Matth. VI. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>31. <HI>What shall we Eat? Or what shall we Drink? Or wherewithal shall we be Cloathed?</HI> Ah, How desperately is the Conversion and Salvation of multitudes in the World, hindred by their <HI>Care, How to live in the World?</HI> Many a <HI>sleight</HI> is put upon the <HI>Word;</HI> and as he of old said, <HI>I have married a Wife, and I cannot come:</HI> So they have this to say for it; <HI>I am a poor Man, and I have a Wife and so many small Children to Maintain; and therefore I cannot use the Care that I would use for the welfare of my Soul.</HI> When the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is <HI>Preached,</HI> the <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>This World</HI> will not let them spare <HI>Two Hours</HI> in <HI>six Days</HI> to take a step in∣to the House of GOD. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD lies by <HI>Unread,</HI> because the <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>This World</HI> makes them say, <HI>I am not at Leisure.</HI> The <HI>First and Great Commandment</HI> of the Gospel, is; To <HI>Believe</HI> on a Glorious CHRIST, and carry a distressed Soul unto him, with a Recognition of all his <HI>Offices.</HI> Now, if many an one should be asked; <HI>Hast thou
<PB N="61" REF="002905_0066_0FE691681D0D6C78"/>taken Care to get thy Soul under the Wings of thy SA∣VIOUR?</HI> The Answer must be, <HI>No.</HI> And the <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>This World,</HI> is the Thing that has hindred it. This <HI>Care</HI> keeps People from going thro' such a <HI>Process of Repentance,</HI> as one would think every one that has any Thoughts of <HI>Death,</HI> must immediately come into: The <HI>Care</HI> of living in <HI>This World,</HI> so takes them up, and so takes them off, that from Day to Day they leave undone, what every <HI>Dy∣ing Man</HI> in his Wits would immediately do. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD calls Men to uphold <HI>secret Commu∣nion</HI> with GOD, in a <HI>Religious Retirement;</HI> and have a Morning and Evening <HI>Sacrifice</HI> also with their Families. But what keeps them from the doing of the Things that are of so much conse∣quence for the good of their Souls? 'Tis the <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>This World.</HI> For, say they, <HI>We are so poor that we can't spare the Time from our Business for the Exercises of Religion.</HI> Yea, The <HI>Care of This World</HI> causes <HI>Poor People</HI> to do those things, which are <HI>Forbidden</HI> in the Word of GOD, and for <HI>which the wrath of GOD comes on the Children of Disobedience.</HI> You read of such a thing as That; Prov. XXX. 9. <HI>To be poor, and steal,</HI> and then <HI>to take the Name of GOD in Vain.</HI> Men will <HI>Cheat,</HI> and <HI>Ly,</HI> and <HI>Steal,</HI> and <HI>Forswear</HI> themselves, and Profane the <HI>Lords-day;</HI> because the <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>This World</HI> makes them afraid of coming to want, if they do not by such courses releeve themselves. In fine, How should this <HI>carking Care</HI> do any other than <HI>Choak</HI> the <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word?</HI> It <HI>Choaks</HI> the very <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> and all the Faculties of the <HI>Careful</HI> Ones. Yea, some have <HI>Choaked</HI> themselves <HI>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally,</HI> for fear of <HI>starving,</HI> and <HI>chosen strangling rather than life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="002905_0067_0FE691DF87844160"/>
Secondly. There are <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> more pecu∣liar to <HI>Rich People,</HI> which hinder the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD from having a good Effect, especially upon that sort of People. The <HI>Riches</HI> which fill the Hearts of these, tho' they afford no better nor longer Enjoyments than the <HI>Crackling of Thorns under a Pot;</HI> yet these <HI>Riches</HI> are most Bewitching Things unto them. Awful, Awful is the Warning, which the Lord who has the <HI>Keys of Heaven</HI> in his Hand, has given unto us; Mat. XIX. 23. <HI>Verily, I say unto you, That a Rich Man shall hardly Enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Even so; A <HI>Rich Man</HI> will <HI>hardly</HI> be affected with the Miseries of an <HI>Unrege∣nerate</HI> Soul, of which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, is a <HI>Roll filled with Lamentation and Mourning, and Wo.</HI> A <HI>Rich Man</HI> will <HI>hardly</HI> Abstain from those <HI>Liberties,</HI> of which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD requires our <HI>Flesh</HI> to bear some Abridgments and Abatements. A <HI>Rich Man</HI> will <HI>bardly</HI> make it his <HI>Main Aims</HI> to lay up a <HI>Treasure in Heaven,</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD en∣joyns upon every one that would come to Heaven. Our Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> never Preach'd more unsuccess∣fully, than when he had an Auditory of <HI>Rich Folks,</HI> to Preach the <HI>Word</HI> unto. <HI>Rich Folks</HI> have many <HI>Employments,</HI> many <HI>Diversions;</HI> If the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD come unto them they say like that <HI>Unhappy</HI> Man, <HI>I will hear thee at a more convenient season. Rich Folks</HI> have <HI>High Spirits;</HI> They are too ready to <HI>despise</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, when it is brought unto them; like <HI>Pharaoh</HI> who said, <HI>Who is the Lord, that I should obey his Voice? Rich Folks</HI> have much of a <HI>Temporal Happiness</HI> in their hands. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD urges them, to nothing so much, as to seek after a <HI>Eternal Happiness.</HI> 'Tis to little purpose;
<PB N="63" REF="002905_0068_0FE691693A5D73B8"/>They have already what is <HI>Temporal:</HI> This they think may be <HI>sufficient;</HI> They taste the sweet of it; they know no better. Nor will a Rich <HI>Nabal</HI> ea∣sily be so <HI>Humble,</HI> so <HI>Thankful,</HI> so <HI>Bountiful,</HI> as the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD commands them to be, who are <HI>the Rich in this World.</HI> There is one thing in the Condition of many <HI>Rich Men</HI> which cannot be with sufficient Horror thought upon <HI>Great E∣states,</HI> like to <HI>great Rivers,</HI> often are swelled by Muddy Streams running into them. Some of the <HI>Wealth</HI> is <HI>Ill gotten Wealth. Dishonest Gain</HI> has in∣creased it. <HI>Unfair</HI> and <HI>unjust</HI> Things have been done in the amassing of it. A <HI>Restitution</HI> is now requisite; A <HI>Restitution</HI> as far as the Robber is able; either to the <HI>wronged parties,</HI> or if they can't be found, in <HI>Deodands:</HI> Without This, their Sin re∣mains <HI>unrepented</HI> of, and GOD will be a <HI>Revenger. Zacheus</HI> comes to <HI>Restitution,</HI> and THEN <HI>Salvation comes to him.</HI> Now, How <HI>hardly</HI> is a <HI>Rich Man</HI> brought unto This! He'l sooner <HI>Dy</HI> than be brought unto it. I have said enough. How of∣ten is that <HI>Word</HI> of GOD fulfilled, Eccl. V. 13. <HI>Riches kept for the owners thereof to their Hurt.</HI> Sure∣ly, The <HI>Riches</HI> which <HI>keep</HI> the <HI>owners</HI> from getting and from doing that <HI>Good,</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is intended and adapted for, are <HI>kept</HI> for the <HI>Hurt</HI> of the owners. In short; <HI>Riches</HI> do <HI>Choak</HI> the <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word.</HI> How? Because they <HI>Cheat</HI> the People that are fascinated with them. 'Tis from what we are here told of, <HI>The Deceitfulness of Riches. Riches</HI> tell us, That they will <HI>Defend</HI> us from all Inconveniencies. But they <HI>Deceive</HI> us; They signify nothing to deliver those that have them, in <HI>the Day of the wrath of the Lord.</HI> They
<PB N="64" REF="002905_0069_0FE6916961E9C728"/>find, that <HI>in the midst of their sufficiency they are in straits</HI> They are driven to dispute the common Translation of the Text, <HI>Money answers all things;</HI> and on further search into it, see, that it is only a Caution against <HI>Luxury,</HI> with a Remembrance, that <HI>Money must pay for all. Riches</HI> tells us, That they will <HI>stay</HI> with us. But they <HI>Deceive</HI> us; They are usually put into the <HI>Bag with Holes,</HI> which the Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> speaks of. They <HI>take to themselves Wings,</HI> and <HI>flee away towards Heaven;</HI> T'were well if the <HI>Hearts</HI> which we sett upon them did so. Tho' we are forewarn'd, that these <HI>Riches</HI> will <HI>Cheat</HI> us, yet we believe the <HI>Cheat:</HI> And our <HI>Believing</HI> of the <HI>Cheat,</HI> is the <HI>undoing</HI> of our Soul, and the <HI>De∣feating</HI> of all the <HI>Good,</HI> that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD would, if <HI>That</HI> were Believed as it should be, do unto us. One thing more, 'Tis a Thing which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD exceedingly demands of us: and it is a <HI>Frame</HI> which Heaven exceedingly ap∣proves in the Children of Men; yea, They who have it not, are the <HI>Covetous</HI> whom the <HI>Lord Abhors:</HI> A continual <HI>Dependence</HI> on GOD, and on His Fa∣therly, Favourable, Perpetual <HI>Providence.</HI> There is a Venom in <HI>Riches,</HI> disposing our depraved Hearts, to cast off their <HI>Dependence</HI> on GOD, and betray them into a vile Imagination, as if, at least, for the supply of their more common wants, <HI>They can do well enough without Him.</HI> If they that have their Hearts Insatiably set upon the heaping up of <HI>Riches,</HI> would search their own Hearts, they would find This lying at the Bottom of their <HI>Eager pur∣suit;</HI> A secret Inclination to be Released from their <HI>Dependence</HI> on the <HI>living</HI> GOD, and have a <HI>Dunghil</HI> GOD of their own, at their own Com∣mand,
<PB N="65" REF="002905_0070_0FE6917036CB4090"/>their own Dispose; [This, the <HI>Nonsense</HI> of the Cursed <HI>Idolatry!</HI>] to <HI>supply their wants from Riches,</HI> which they count their <HI>Glory,</HI> by the <HI>Mam∣mon</HI> which they <HI>trust in.</HI> O <HI>Hearts departing from the living GOD!</HI> The GOD who <HI>searches</HI> you, e∣ven with <HI>Candles,</HI> he sees what you would be <HI>settled</HI> on. How wretchedly is his <HI>Word</HI> lost upon you!</P>
<P>Thirdly; There are many <HI>Lusts</HI> incident unto all sorts of People, thro' which it is that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD comes to be without a good Effect upon them: Even those which our SAVIOUR calls, <HI>The Lusts of other things.</HI> But, what <HI>Lusts</HI> are these? There are the <HI>Lusts</HI> of <HI>Pleasures</HI> that hinder Men from hearkening to the <HI>pleasant Word</HI> of GOD; A <HI>Word sweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-Comb.</HI> We read in Luk. VIII. 14. of being, <HI>Choked with the pleasures of this Life, and bringing of no Fruit unto perfection.</HI> The ways recommended in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, are <HI>pleasant ways.</HI> But the <HI>Pleasures</HI> of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> do prejudice and indispose Men, to those <HI>Narrow ways. Hearts</HI> that are <HI>fat as Grease</HI> with the <HI>Pleasures of sense,</HI> will be utterly <HI>senseless</HI> of every thing that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD brings unto them. An <HI>Herod,</HI> will <HI>fear</HI> a <HI>Righteous</HI> and an <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly</HI> Evan∣gelist; and <HI>keep a watchful Eye over him,</HI> and <HI>having heard him he</HI> will be <HI>much perplexed, tho' he heard him peaceably,</HI> [This is the Account given of him, in a Translation that some have chosen of it:] Thus it will be, while he has an <HI>Herodias</HI> to en∣tangle him. Again; There are the <HI>Lusts</HI> of <HI>Ho∣nours,</HI> that hinder Men from <HI>Honouring</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, as they ought to do. Hence our Lord said; Joh. V. 44. <HI>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another, and seek not the Honour that
<PB N="66" REF="002905_0071_0FE69170561624F0"/>cometh from GOD only?</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD calls for all possible <HI>Honours</HI> to be paid unto the <HI>Son</HI> of GOD; Yea, That <HI>we Honour the Son as we Honour the Father.</HI> But it exacts many things from us, which according to our Carnal Notions of the matter, we fancy our <HI>Honours</HI> may be impaired by our Submission to. This <HI>Pride</HI> makes Men <HI>ashamed</HI> of <HI>Confessing</HI> a CHRIST <HI>before Men</HI> as the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD bids us to do. It <HI>hardens</HI> our Hearts: and makes us like those <HI>Proud Men</HI> who told the Pro∣phet, That <HI>they would not hearken to him.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; The Apostle has decided it; Jam. IV. 1. <HI>Whence come Wars and Fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your Lusts?</HI> There are the <HI>Lusts</HI> of <HI>Contention</HI> often getting Head among them that hear the Word of GOD: But then, The <HI>Contentions</HI> will <HI>not obey the Truth.</HI> No, but upon the <HI>Envying and Strife</HI> among them, there follows <HI>Confusion and every Evil work.</HI> Very fitly indeed may thes <HI>Lusts</HI> be called, <HI>Thorns:</HI> For, by these <HI>Lusts</HI> People keep shamefully <HI>Tearing</HI> and <HI>Scratching</HI> one another. Now, 'tis astonishing to to think, how much the <HI>Success of the Gospel</HI> is hin∣dred, where a <HI>Spirit of Contention</HI> is got among a People. <HI>Satan</HI> knows what he does, when he throws in <HI>Bones of Contention</HI> among a People, which embroil them, and enrage them. Instead of getting the <HI>Good</HI> that should be gotten by the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, their Thought and their Time, is taken up in doing of <HI>Hurt</HI> unto one another. The <HI>House</HI> of GOD becomes as an <HI>House haunted with Evil Spirits.</HI> GOD withdraws from his <HI>House;</HI> yea, <HI>Abhors the Sanctuarp,</HI> and goes far from it.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="002905_0072_0FE6917197043A28"/>
The <HI>Grieved Spirit</HI> of GOD grievously witholds His Influences from His Ordinances there. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is meerly thrown away, among such a <HI>Thorny People.</HI> Indeed, Our SAVIOUR once appeared in a <HI>Thorn-Bush.</HI> But, When a Church once becomes a <HI>Thorn-Bush,</HI> embarassed with <HI>Contention,</HI> our Lord JESUS CHRIST will grant little appearance of himself, to bless his <HI>Word</HI> for the good of the People there. Oh! That every <HI>Church,</HI> would <HI>Mark them that cause Division<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and put <HI>Marks of Dislike</HI> upon them, and be afraid, of <HI>Dancing after their Pipe,</HI> and of being led into a <HI>Cave</HI> to be trembled at. If a <HI>Contention</HI> should be going to go to <HI>Begin,</HI> Oh! let it be <HI>left off</HI> before 'tis <HI>Begun.</HI> With <HI>Prudence,</HI> with <HI>Patience,</HI> with <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> may the <HI>Sons of Wisdom,</HI> always crush the <HI>First Beginnings</HI> of <HI>Contention:</HI> the very <HI>Eggs</HI> of a <HI>Cockatrice:</HI> Take away the <HI>Fuel,</HI> as the <HI>Fire</HI> is just going to be kindled. Behold the <HI>out-breakings</HI> of <HI>Contention,</HI> with as much Terror, as if that Voice were to be heard, from Heaven upon it; <HI>Never any good Fruit be any more found among that unhappy People!</HI></P>
<P>But I may not leave this <HI>Thorny Ground</HI> without some Essays of Cultivation upon it. There are two Essays to be made.</P>
<P N="1">I. 'Tis Time for us to <HI>Examine</HI> ourselves whe∣ther our <HI>Heart</HI> have not the <HI>Lusts</HI> of a <HI>worldly Heart,</HI> reigning in it, and rendring it as a <HI>Barren So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> before the Lord. It is too, too Evident, That the <HI>good Word</HI> of our GOD and SAVIOUR, misses of doing much of that <HI>Good,</HI> that should be done among us. As the Prophet of old com∣plain'd,
<PB N="68" REF="002905_0073_0FE69171B551C3D8"/><HI>Lord, who hath Believed?</HI> The complaint may be renew'd at this Day.
<Q><HI>Lord, How few</HI> do, <HI>Turn</HI> and <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD and <HI>Cleanse their ways</HI> by <HI>taking Heed according to his Word? How few</HI> do prize a precious CHRIST, and lay hold on the <HI>Salvation,</HI> which is <HI>prepared before the Face of all People,</HI> in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD? <HI>How few</HI> do Behave themselves as the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD has di∣rected them; and as <HI>Believing</HI> the <HI>Eye</HI> of GOD always upon them, to see how <HI>Circumspectly</HI> they <HI>Walk,</HI> and how much they seek to be <HI>Blessings</HI> unto all about them; and as <HI>Believing,</HI> the aw∣ful Things of a <HI>Future State,</HI> whereof GOD has <HI>given Assurance unto all Men? Lord,</HI> who is there that <HI>strives to enter the straight Gate,</HI> and <HI>lay hold on Eternal Life?</HI></Q> Now, what is the Cause of this? Whence does it come to pass, that the Dispensations of the Gospel, are so deplorably unsuccessful among us? <HI>Is there not a Cause?</HI> Doubtless, The <HI>Thorns</HI> of a <HI>worldly Heart</HI> are the Things that <HI>Choak</HI> the Blessed <HI>Seed of Life</HI> in our Souls. Here, Here is that <HI>Mother-Sin,</HI> which may indeed be called, <HI>A Mother of Abominations.</HI> 'Tis hinted in that passage; Psal. CXIX. 36. <HI>Incline my Heart unto thy Testimonies, and not unto Covetous∣ness.</HI> 'Tis because we have an <HI>Heart</HI> so much <HI>In∣clined</HI> unto <HI>Covetousness,</HI> and full of <HI>Covetous Inclina∣tions</HI> to Propound a Faelicity in the Fruition of <HI>This World,</HI> that our <HI>Heart</HI> is no more <HI>Inclined</HI> unto Compliances with the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. Examine yourselves, <HI>O unfruitful Hearers,</HI> Examine your∣selves, how far the Characters of a <HI>worldly Heart</HI> are to be found upon you; And, <HI>because</HI> when GOD hath <HI>sown much,</HI> there is but <HI>little brought in,
<PB N="69" REF="002905_0074_0FE6917729C5C190"/>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your ways.</HI> Ex∣amine, with the more of sollicitude, because I now lay my Finger on the <HI>principal sore</HI> of a Country that is <HI>full of putrifying sores.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is from Heaven arraigning us upon that Indictment, That <HI>not having the Fear of GOD be∣fore our Eyes, we set up this World for our GOD; and for our chusing of a New GOD, we have War in our Gates.</HI> Methinks, we may hear our SAVIOUR from Heaven sighing over us, in such Terms as those; 2. Tim. IV. 10. They have <HI>Forsaken me, having loved this present World.</HI> From a <HI>worldly Heart</HI> it is, that the <HI>Gospel</HI> is not valued, not fol∣lowed, not obeyed, and kept close unto; And the <HI>Institutions</HI> of the Gospel, are not esteemed and observed. From a <HI>worldly Heart</HI> it is, that a∣bundance of Criminal Things, directly contrary to the Gospel of GOD, and Reproachful to the Profession of the Gospel, are done among us. From a <HI>worldly Heart</HI> it is, that after People have sat under the most Charming Dispensations of the Gospel, for many years together, they are no more moved, than the <HI>Deaf Adder,</HI> by the Voice of the <HI>Charmer,</HI> but they <HI>go on still in their Trespasses.</HI> Yet more particularly, <HI>My Son, Be thou Admonished of</HI> these Two Things.</P>
<P>First; If the <HI>World</HI> have <HI>most of our Heart,</HI> it is a sign that the <HI>Thorns</HI> of <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> have over∣grown our <HI>Heart.</HI> Now, 'tis very plain, <HI>This World</HI> has <HI>most of your Heart,</HI> if you can Indulge yourselves in any <HI>known</HI> Sin for the sake of the <HI>World,</HI> or if you will venture upon any Thing that you take to be an <HI>Ungodly</HI> or <HI>Dishonest</HI> Thing, to

<P>Secondly. Many an one has a Soul undone, by the <HI>Thorns</HI> of the <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> that little suspects his own must undoing Circumstances. Deluded and Enslaved Soul, If the <HI>Bramble</HI> reign over thee, a <HI>Fire</HI> shall <HI>come out of the Bramble,</HI> and shall <HI>devour</HI> thee, tho' thou appear ever so much as one a∣mong the <HI>Cedars of Lebanon.</HI> Verily, a <HI>worldly Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will as infallibly keep a Man out from the <HI>Kingdom of GOD,</HI> as any grosser and more scanda∣lous Wickedness. For we are taught, <HI>Idolaters shall not inherit the Kingdom of GOD;</HI> And we are also taught, <HI>A Covetous Man is an Idolater.</HI> But now, <HI>Here</HI> is the Danger. <HI>Worldliness</HI> is a <HI>close</HI> kind of a Sin.

If a Man should fall into <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> or <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> or, <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> his Conscience would fly in his Face. But a Man may have a Soul <HI>choaking</HI> with <HI>worldliness,</HI> and perish among the <HI>worldly-minded Enemies</HI> of GOD, while he little imagines, what he <HI>is,</HI> and what he <HI>acts,</HI> and whi∣ther he's a going. How many even <HI>great Professors</HI> do so! The worst that shall be said of a Man, is. That <HI>he is a good Husband.</HI> But this <HI>good Husband</HI> is one who sells a Soul for a <HI>Song;</HI> one who squan∣ders away <HI>Substantial</HI> and <HI>Eternal Glories</HI> for a lit∣tle shining bit of <HI>Clay;</HI> One who barters away GOD and CHRIST and Heaven, for a little of the <HI>Dust of the Earth,</HI> and the <HI>Serpents Food.</HI> Ah, wretched <HI>Husbandry!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. But then, 'tis Time to hearken unto the <HI>Debortation;</HI> 1. Joh. II. 15. <HI>Love not the World, nei∣ther the things that are in the World.</HI> Let not the <HI>Lusts of this World,</HI> hinder you from a <HI>Fruitful Hear∣ing</HI> of that <HI>Word,</HI> which will <HI>save your Souls,</HI> if it be heard as it ought to be.</P>
<P>I will fetch a few strokes of my <HI>Weeding-Hook,</HI> at the <HI>Lusts</HI> which threaten to <HI>Choak</HI> all Good in your Souls. Yea, Oh! That you could <HI>Quench them as the Fire of Thorns!</HI> But, <HI>In the Name of the Lord,</HI> I will try to <HI>destroy them.</HI></P>
<P>First. Remember This; It can't be <HI>long,</HI> that you shall enjoy the Things of <HI>This World,</HI> after which your <HI>worldly Lusts</HI> do crave and rave and carry you out Importunately. This Brand is to be set upon these Things; 1 Cor. VII. 29. <HI>This I say, The Time for them is but short.</HI> We know to
<PB N="72" REF="002905_0077_0FE691E1D69D17D0"/>whom they were in a <HI>Temptation</HI> all shown, <HI>In a Moment of Time.</HI> If you had them all, <HI>In a Moment of Time,</HI> the <HI>Show</HI> will be over. And, <HI>Eye your Pot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can feel the Thorns,</HI> in so little a while, all the <HI>Light</HI> which these <HI>Thorns</HI> can yield you, 'tis, <HI>All Vanish∣ed! All</HI> come to <HI>nothing!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Remember This; While you Con∣form to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD your SAVIOUR, you shall be sure to possess the Things of <HI>This World,</HI> so far as you have any occasion for them. You have His never-failing Engagement for it; Matth. VI. 33. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of GOD and His Righ∣teousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</HI> Yield <HI>Obedience,</HI> and cast off all <HI>Diffidence,</HI> and make the <HI>Experiment: Prove me now, saith the Lord.</HI> See whether you have not such a <HI>Competency</HI> of these Things, that you will have cause to, <HI>be content with such things as you have.</HI> The rather, because you will have less <HI>Thorns</HI> in them, than what o∣thers have: Your <HI>Little</HI> will be <HI>better</HI> to you, than the <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>many wicked,</HI> who have but multipli∣ed <HI>Thorns</HI> unto themselves in all that they have gotten.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Remember This; If the <HI>Thorns</HI> of <HI>this World,</HI> render you <HI>Children of Disobedience</HI> under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD your SAVIOUR, you will at last suffer Destruction like <HI>Thorns,</HI> in the <HI>Fire</HI> of His Indignation. It is a Marvellous Word, 2 Sam. XXIII. 67. <HI>They shall be all of them as Thorns thrust away; and they shall be utterly burut with Fire id the Sabbath:</HI> So 'tis to be rendred: That is to say, At the coming of the Lord, in <HI>Flaming Fire,</HI> to bring on the Great <HI>Sabbatism,</HI> that <HI>remains for the People of GOD.</HI> Oh! Let not your <HI>Hearts</HI> be
<PB N="73" REF="002905_0078_0FE691E1F4585078"/>full of <HI>Thorns,</HI> in the <HI>Sabbath</HI> which is now vouch∣safed unto us; lest in that <HI>Sabbath</HI> you must have an Expectation of a <HI>Fiery Indignation</HI> to <HI>devour</HI> you. If the <HI>Earth</HI> bear <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Briars,</HI> it is <HI>Re∣jected and nigh unto Cursing,</HI> and the <HI>End</HI> of the Wicked ones, who are themselves but <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Briars,</HI> will be, <HI>To be Burned.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>What shall we do to be saved,</HI> from the <HI>Thorns,</HI> and from the <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> of the <HI>Thorns?</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Prayer,</HI> our <HI>Prayer,</HI> unto our GOD; and with an Eye unto a SAVIOUR, who once wore a <HI>Crown of Thorns</HI> for us; This is the First Thing that is called for. Beg it of Him, That for the sake of <HI>those Thorns,</HI> you may be delivered from these <HI>Thorns.</HI> Cry to Him; <HI>Lord, Save me from the Lusts of a worldly Heart! Lord, Let not the Things of this World, hinder the good Effects of thy Word upon us!</HI></P>
<P>But more particularly pray, That the <HI>Thorns</HI> of <HI>Affliction,</HI> by which <HI>this World</HI> is Embittered, may be <HI>sanctified,</HI> for our being thereby made more Conformable to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. Our GOD is <HI>Teaching us by the Thorns of the Wilderness,</HI> what it is to <HI>Sin</HI> against Him. The Language of these <HI>Thorns</HI> is, <HI>Know and see, that it is an evil Thing, and a bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy GOD.</HI> Let these <HI>Thorns</HI> awaken us to mourn for our <HI>Sin;</HI> and, let it <HI>reach to our Heart,</HI> when we feel what our <HI>Way</HI> and our <HI>Doings</HI> have <HI>procured</HI> unto us. By our Distresses and our Confinements, our GOD is <HI>Hedging up our way with Thorns.</HI> Let us not be <HI>Angry</HI> at the <HI>Hedge,</HI> but even <HI>Thankful</HI> for it; And <HI>prick'd</HI> by the <HI>Thorns,</HI> let <HI>All the Fruit be, to take a∣way our Sin,</HI> and bring us to say, <HI>I will not offend any more.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="002905_0079_0FE69179D180CA08"/>
Being so much among the <HI>Thorns,</HI> Oh! May we be as <HI>Lillies among the Thorns,</HI> in regard of our PIETY flourishing in the midst of our Calamities. Whatever <HI>Sad Thing</HI> befalls us, let us be inquisi∣tive, <HI>What is the Voice of the Glorious GGD unto me, from that Thorn in the Flesh, which He gives unto me?</HI></P>
<P>And Finally; What can we now do so Rea∣sonably, as long for the <HI>Second Adam</HI>'s World, which will have no <HI>Thorns</HI> to incommode it! <HI>Come, Lord JESUS, come quickly!</HI></P>
<P>¶ We have seen Three sorts of <HI>Bad Ground</HI> all <HI>sown</HI> with that <HI>Good Seed,</HI> which we have in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR dispensed unto us. But must <HI>All Ground</HI> prove no better than so? <HI>GOD forbid!</HI> No, It may be a Consolation unto the Faithful Servants of GOD, That wherever He sends His <HI>Good Word,</HI> He intends that some <HI>Good</HI> shall be done by it. Wherever the Gospel comes, 'tis probable, there will be some <HI>Good Ef∣fects</HI> of it, upon some or other of them that hear it. And if there must be some <HI>Good Ground</HI> where the Gospel comes, I hope, that some of it will be found here this Day. <HI>Grant it, O our Good GOD, that it may be so!</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The <HI>Good Ground.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We are informed, Lastly; That some who hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, prove a <HI>Good Ground,</HI> when the <HI>Seed</HI> is cast upon it. And as there were <HI>Three Spe∣cies</HI> of the <HI>Bad Ground,</HI> so there are <HI>Three Degrees</HI> of the <HI>Good.</HI> All the <HI>Good Ground,</HI> has this Report
<PB N="75" REF="002905_0080_0FE6917FDF771978"/>given of it; <HI>They hear the Word, and receive it, and bring forth Fruit.</HI> But then the <HI>Fruit</HI> of some is more than the <HI>Fruit</HI> of others; Our SAVIOUR thus proportions it; <HI>Some Thirty-fold, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Sixty, and some an Hundred.</HI></P>
<P>And this is the <HI>Admonition,</HI> from it, which, I hope, will find many <HI>Fruitful Hearers</HI> among you.</P>
<P><HI>The Good Hearers of the Gospel, tho' they are not all a∣like Fruitful, yet they all bring forth some good Fruit; Yea, they both Increase and Persist in their do∣ing so.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a <HI>Bread of Propositions,</HI> that is now to be set. before you on the <HI>Table</HI> in the House of our GOD. The <HI>Bread</HI> made, of the <HI>Corn</HI> in the <HI>Good Ground,</HI> is to be Exhibited in the ensuing <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. There are some <HI>Good Hearers,</HI> among those whom the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the Gospel falls upon. It would be sad indeed if it should not be so! These <HI>Good Hearers</HI> are they of whom our SAVIOUR says, Luk. VIII. 15. They have a <HI>Good Heart</HI> in the <HI>Hearing</HI> of it. It were to be <HI>wished,</HI> that <HI>All</HI> the <HI>Ground,</HI> which has the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD cast up∣on it, were <HI>Good Ground.</HI> But this is a Thing more to be <HI>wished</HI> for, than to be <HI>hoped</HI> for. However, some of the <HI>Ground</HI> is <HI>Good.</HI> And, <HI>How comes this to pass?</HI> Truly, The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SAVI∣OUR, falls not upon any <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>Good</HI> before the <HI>Word</HI> first falls upon it. There is no <HI>Good Heart</HI> in any Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> until the <HI>Word</HI> itself makes it so. <HI>Wo</HI> would be unto us, we should be Damned unto <HI>Eternal</HI> Wickedness and Barren∣ness;
<PB N="76" REF="002905_0081_0FE6917FFA588DD0"/>if the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD should never <HI>do Good</HI> unto us, until we bring a <HI>Good Heart</HI> unto it. Every Man has in him, <HI>An Evil Heart of Unbelief depart∣ing from the living GOD;</HI> And no Man can give unto himself a <HI>Better Heart;</HI> Such and none but such, an <HI>Heart</HI> it is, that we do <HI>at first</HI> bring unto the <HI>Good Word</HI> of our GOD. We read, Mic. II. 7. <HI>Do not my Words do good unto him that walks up∣rightly?</HI> If the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD should never <HI>do Good</HI> unto any, until they do <HI>walk uprightly,</HI> it would never <HI>do Good</HI> unto any at all! But it <HI>first of all</HI> does this <HI>Good</HI> unto us; It makes us <HI>upright,</HI> thro' a <HI>Change</HI> of <HI>Heart</HI> produced in us; and it Inclines us and Excites us to <HI>walk uprightly;</HI> And <HI>Then</HI> fol∣lows all the other <HI>Good,</HI> which is received from it by them that <HI>walk uprightly.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if we Enquire, What are the Characters of a <HI>Good Heart</HI> under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD our SA∣VIOUR, Behold, our SAVIOUR himself will soon satisfy that Enquiry.</P>
<P>First. A <HI>Good Heart</HI> hearing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, hears it with <HI>Understanding.</HI> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Mat. XIII. 23. <HI>He that received Seed into the good Ground, is he that heareth the Word, and understandeth it.</HI> When the Disciples of our Lord, heard his <HI>Word</HI> with a <HI>Good Heart, He said unto them, Have ye understood all those things? They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.</HI> We are truly told; Prov. XIX. 2. <HI>That the Soul be without Knowledge, it is not good.</HI> Be sure, It is not a <HI>good Heart,</HI> that is <HI>without the Knowledge</HI> of those Things, which <HI>to know, is Life Eternal.</HI> When you hear, <HI>who</HI> your SAVIOUR is; What are your <HI>Wants</HI> of Him; What He <HI>has done</HI> for us; What He <HI>will do</HI> for us; And, what
<PB N="77" REF="002905_0082_0FE6918166E250B0"/>He will have <HI>to be done</HI> by us; Then, as <HI>Philip</HI> asked the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Treasurer, <HI>Understandest thou what thou Readest?</HI> Thus we are to ask ourselves, <HI>Do I understand what I hear?</HI> If we don't <HI>understand</HI> something of those points, our <HI>Ignorance</HI> will prove <HI>the Mother of Destruction</HI> unto us. Yea, Being a <HI>People of no understanding,</HI> He that <HI>made us will not have Mercy on us.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly; A <HI>Good Heart</HI> hearing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, hears it with <HI>Affection.</HI> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Mat. IV. 20. <HI>They Hear the Word and Receive it.</HI> We then hear the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD with a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> when we give a good <HI>Reception</HI> to it. A good <HI>Reception</HI> to it, implies a good <HI>Affection</HI> to it. It is the mark of a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> when the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is a <HI>Good Word</HI> unto it. Such a <HI>Good Heart</HI> will say; Isa. XXXIX. 8. <HI>Good is the Word of the Lord.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Desire</HI> of such an <HI>Heart</HI> (which is <HI>only good</HI>) runs out in such Terms as those, <HI>Lord, Thou art Good, and thou dost Good; O Teach me thy Statutes.</HI> A <HI>Good Heart,</HI> hearing the <HI>Commandments</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> says, <HI>This Word is very pure, and therefore, O Lord, thy Servant loveth it.</HI> Hearing the <HI>Promises</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> it says, <HI>I rejoyce in these Testimonies more than in all Riches.</HI> Hearing the <HI>Threatenings</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> it says, <HI>Lord, I am afraid of these Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>More than this; Thirdly. A <HI>Good Heart</HI> hear∣ing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, hears it with <HI>Retention.</HI> So our SAVIOUR explains it; Luk. VIII. 15. <HI>Hav∣ing heard the Word, they keep it.</HI> It is a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> in which the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, is <HI>kept,</HI> as it forever deserves to be; and laid up, as the <HI>Book of the Law</HI> was in the <HI>Ark</HI> of old. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD must
<PB N="78" REF="002905_0083_0FE691E9C02F39D8"/>be laid up, as an Invaluable <HI>Treasure</HI> there. A Man of a <HI>good Heart,</HI> may say, with Him; Psal. CXIX. 11. <HI>I have hid thy word in my Heart.</HI> In a <HI>good Heart,</HI> the <HI>Memory</HI> becomes a <HI>Store-house</HI> for the <HI>word</HI> of GOD. The <HI>Evangelized</HI> Soul, says, <HI>I will not forget thy word;</HI> and it <HI>gives earnest heed un∣to the things which it hears, lest at any time it may let them slip;</HI> and lose them, in their <HI>leaking</HI> from it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, and Finally. What is a <HI>good Heart,</HI> but an <HI>honest Heart?</HI> So tis explained; Luk. VIII. 15. <HI>An honest and a good Heart.</HI> The Term <HI>Honest,</HI> is as much as to say, <HI>Beautiful.</HI> There is a <HI>Beauty</HI> in <HI>Religion;</HI> and particularly those <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> wherein we deal Justly, Kindly, and Fairly with our Neighbours; These have a <HI>Beauty</HI> in them. An <HI>Heart</HI> sincerely Religious, is an <HI>Honest,</HI> that is to say, a <HI>Beautiful Heart.</HI> The Glorious GOD <HI>looks down from Heaven, and beholds from the habita∣tion of his Holiness and of his Glory,</HI> and with Delight He sees His own <HI>Beautiful Image</HI> upon it. But most particularly, Tis an <HI>Heart</HI> loth to wrong or hurt any Man in the World, and an <HI>Heart</HI> set upon do∣ing all the Good that ever he can, to all that are about us. This is a <HI>Good Heart,</HI> and there is that <HI>Beauty</HI> in such an <HI>Heart,</HI> that all the World will a∣gree to call <HI>Good.</HI> We are to have such an <HI>Heart</HI> as this, in <HI>hearing</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> of our GOD.</P>
<P>But, <HI>What shall I do to get such an Heart?</HI> The Answer is, Come to the <HI>Word</HI> For such an <HI>Heart,</HI> when you cannot come <HI>with</HI> it. And therewithal, come to the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> who is the Giv∣er of such an <HI>Heart.</HI> Christian, Address thy SA∣VIOUR, with such a Petition as That; Psal. LI. 10.
<PB N="79" REF="002905_0084_0FE691818768F518"/><HI>Create in me a clean Heart, O GOD.</HI> Thy SA∣VIOUR demands, <HI>Give me thy Heart.</HI> Bring it unto Him, and beg of Him, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, My Heart is a Blind Heart, and a Base Heart, and an Heart that is desperately wicked; But such an Heart as it is, I humbly lay it before thee. Oh! Do thou take it, and make a good Heart of it, and then I shall in an acceptable manner give my Heart unto thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. All the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the Gospel, are <HI>Fruit∣ful</HI> ones. There will be upon every <HI>Good Hearer</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> those Laudable Things, wherein it may be said, He <HI>bears Fruit.</HI> If a Man sit under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, and bring forth no <HI>Fruit</HI> of it, what sort of a <HI>Ground</HI> is that Man? We are told, Heb. VI. 8. <HI>It is Rejected, nigh unto Cursing.</HI></P>
<P>The Question here to be thought upon, is; <HI>What is that Fruit, by which the Good Hearers of the Gospel, are distinguished?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fruit,</HI> in general, is, The <HI>Good Effect</HI> of the Gos∣pel upon us. Of some we read, Col. I. 6. <HI>The Word of the Truth of the Gospel brings forth Fruit in them.</HI> This is, when we Glorify GOD our SA∣VIOUR, with such a <HI>Faith,</HI> and such a <HI>Repentance,</HI> and such a <HI>Purity,</HI> as the Gospel does oblige us to. A <HI>Good Hearer</HI> of the Gospel, brings forth such <HI>Fruit</HI> as This; That the <HI>Gospel of the Grace of God</HI> effectually <HI>teaches</HI> him to <HI>deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and live Godlily, and Soberly, and Righ∣teously in this present world.</HI></P>
<P>O our Hearers; <HI>Hearken and Behold!</HI> The <HI>Good Fruit,</HI> expected from the <HI>Good Seed,</HI> which in your hearing the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD there is cast upon you, must be seen in such Things as these.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="002905_0085_0FE6918866100C90"/>
There must be this <HI>Good Fruit</HI> of what you <HI>hear;</HI> That you must carry your perishing Souls unto your Mighty and Only SAVIOUR, Beseeching of Him, and Relying on Him, to <HI>Reconcile</HI> you unto GOD: Consenting, That He should by His infinite <HI>Merit</HI> bring you into <HI>Peace</HI> with GOD, and by His Almighty <HI>Spirit</HI> work in you that which is <HI>well pleasing in the sight of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>There must be this <HI>Good Fruit</HI> of what you <HI>hear;</HI> That every Thing which appears to the <HI>Light of GOD</HI> within you, an Evil Thing, must be Abomi∣nable to you: You must <HI>Abhor</HI> it, <HI>Avoid</HI> it, wish and seek to be delivered from it: Count a Deli∣verance from it, preferrible to all the Comforta∣ble Things of this World.</P>
<P>There must be this <HI>Good Fruit</HI> of what you <HI>hear;</HI> That it must be your main Intention to Render and Procure <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> to GOD; and the <HI>Service</HI> of GOD must be the chief <HI>End</HI> of your <HI>Actions,</HI> the chief <HI>Sweet</HI> of your <HI>Enjoyments.</HI> You must behave yourselves as having the <HI>Eye</HI> of GOD always upon you: <HI>Do Justice,</HI> and <HI>love Mercy,</HI> and <HI>walk humbly with your GOD:</HI> Abound in <HI>Devoti∣ons</HI> to GOD, and in <HI>Benignities</HI> to Men. Every Day <HI>be in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long;</HI> Every where <HI>do as you would be done unto.</HI></P>
<P>Here is <HI>Good Fruit.</HI> O Soul having such <HI>Fruit</HI> as this found upon thee, <HI>Come near</HI> unto thy SA∣VIOUR, and receive a <HI>Blessing</HI> from Him; and hear Him saying, <HI>See, the Smell of this fruitful Soul, is as the Smell of a Field which the Lord hath bles∣sed.</HI></P>
<P>Syrs, You can't be owned as <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the Gospel, if you are not the <HI>Better</HI> for it; more <HI>Ac∣quainted</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="002905_0086_0FE691E9DB807760"/>with GOD by it; more <HI>Conformed</HI> to CHRIST by it; made the more <HI>meet for the In∣heritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Tho' all the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the Gospel, must be <HI>Really Fruitful,</HI> yet they are not <HI>Equally</HI> so. We read, <HI>They bring forth, some Thirty fold, some Sixty, some an Hundred.</HI> Our SAVIOUR made His Allusion to the <HI>Grain</HI> then most usual in that Countrey. For tho' <HI>Wheat,</HI> which is the <HI>Best Grain,</HI> and affords the <HI>Best Bread,</HI> for the Sons of Men, and which by an observable Providence of GOD, grows in almost all Climates! Will, one Bushel of it, sometimes yield, One <HI>hundred and Fif∣ty;</HI> yet, I suppose, the ordinary Increase is not above an <HI>Hundred.</HI> Indeed, of our <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> one Grain will produce above a <HI>Thousand;</HI> and of <HI>Guiny-Corn,</HI> one Grain has been known to produce <HI>Ten Thousand;</HI> but in <HI>Wheat</HI> it is not so. And in this, every <HI>Soil</HI> is not alike <HI>Fertile;</HI> does not yield <HI>alike.</HI> I take notice, that in one Evangelist, there is no mention of the <HI>Thirty fold,</HI> and the <HI>Sixty fold</HI> produce. It is only said, Luk. VIII. 8. <HI>The Good Ground bare Fruit an Hundred fold.</HI> This may be to note, That tho' this <HI>Uttermost Fruitfulness,</HI> be not the <HI>Attainment,</HI> yet it is the <HI>Endeavour</HI> of every Godly Man: And our Good GOD makes a gra∣cious Construction of the <HI>Endeavour,</HI> and <HI>Accepts the willing Mind.</HI> The <HI>Endeavour</HI> of every Godly Man, in Hearing the <HI>Word,</HI> is to bring forth as much <HI>Fruit,</HI> as the most <HI>Fruitful Saint</HI> that ever lived. He does not <HI>stint</HI> himself, as to the <HI>Fruit</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> upon him. He can say of the <HI>utter∣most Fruitfulness;</HI> as in Phil. III. 14. <HI>I press toward
<PB N="82" REF="002905_0087_0FE691EB98AE3108"/>the Mark.</HI> Yea, But this, even the <HI>Hundred fold,</HI> is not the <HI>Attainment</HI> of every Godly Man. There is as much Difference between the <HI>Fruits</HI> found in the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> as between <HI>Thirty</HI> and an <HI>Hundred.</HI> Some good Men are not one Third part so <HI>Fruitful</HI> as others are. As we read, 1 Cor. XV. 41. <HI>One Star differs from another Star in Glory:</HI> So, <HI>One Saint</HI> also differs from <HI>another Saint</HI> in <HI>Glory.</HI> 'Tis our <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> that is our <HI>Glory.</HI> Our <HI>David</HI> has many <HI>Worthies;</HI> But there is a <HI>First Three,</HI> which all do not come up unto.</P>
<P>Indeed, the <HI>Good Seed</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> is not <HI>Alike</HI> dispensed among the People of GOD. The <HI>Or∣dinances</HI> in some Churches, are administred with more <HI>Light,</HI> and with more <HI>Warmth,</HI> and with more Heavenly Operations than they are in others. It may be Expected, that the <HI>Fruit</HI> will be propor∣tionable. And yet, among those who enjoy the same Administrations, all the truly <HI>Pious</HI> do not bear <HI>Fruit</HI> in a like proportion; and are not of e∣qual <HI>Piety.</HI></P>
<P>First. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD it self, assures and assigns a <HI>Difference,</HI> among them that are the <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word.</HI> Thus we find several Clas∣ses in the <HI>School</HI> of our SAVIOUR. We find, 1. Joh. II. 13. <HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Young Men,</HI> and <HI>little Children;</HI> We find, 1. Cor. III. 1. Some that are <HI>Spiritual;</HI> others that are <HI>Carnal,</HI> and <HI>Babes in Christ.</HI> We find, Rom. XV. 1. Some that are <HI>Strong;</HI> others that are <HI>Weak,</HI> and have their <HI>Infirmities.</HI> Hence we find, that some <HI>Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> are <HI>perfect</HI> ones, in comparison of others that yet are not in a state of Wickedness. We read, Jam. III. 2. <HI>If any Man offend not in Word, the same is a perfect
<PB N="83" REF="002905_0088_0FE691EBB56D75B0"/>Man.</HI> It means not, that he is <HI>Absolutely perfect,</HI> but that he is in the <HI>Highest Form</HI> of Christianity. The Man who rarely, if ever, lets fall a <HI>Word,</HI> that another Man may have cause to blame him for, is this <HI>perfect Man.</HI> Yea, we find some that are <HI>None-such</HI> ones; and are so applauded, <HI>Many have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</HI> So we read of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2. King. XVIII. 5. <HI>There was none like him.</HI> So we read of <HI>Josiah,</HI> 2. King. XXIII. <HI>Like unto him there was none.</HI> So we read of <HI>Timothy;</HI> Phil. II. 20. <HI>No Man like-minded.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, In the <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> all the <HI>Really Fruitful,</HI> are not <HI>equally</HI> so. No; We read, Heb. V. 12. Of some, that may be <HI>Teachers;</HI> and of o∣thers, that need one to <HI>Teach</HI> them the <HI>first Princi∣ples</HI> of the <HI>Oracles of GOD:</HI> Of some that are <HI>of full age,</HI> and have <HI>strong Meat belonging</HI> unto them; and of others that <HI>use Milk,</HI> and are <HI>unskilful in the Word of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Fruits</HI> of a True <HI>Faith;</HI> some can have it said of them, <HI>I have not found so great Faith, no not in Israel.</HI> To others it may be said, <HI>O ye of little Faith.</HI> In the <HI>Fruits</HI> of a True <HI>Love,</HI> some can have it said of them, <HI>They have loved much.</HI> To others it may be said, <HI>Thou hast not the First Love.</HI> In points of <HI>Holy Living,</HI> it may be said of some, <HI>They do that which is Right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David;</HI> nor like a Man wholly <HI>after the Heart of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Some <HI>Good Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> are designed of Heaven to be prepared by the <HI>Word,</HI> for Greater, Higher, Nobler <HI>Services</HI> than others are. Of one that was to have a <HI>Charge over Jeru∣salem,</HI> we read, Neh. VII. 2. <HI>He was a faithful
<PB N="84" REF="002905_0089_0FE69188856D2130"/>Man, and feared GOD above many.</HI> GOD intends these and those for <HI>singular Services;</HI> and so he will make them <HI>Fruitful Men above many,</HI> and such as his <HI>Word</HI> shall bring to more of his <HI>Fear,</HI> than ma∣ny are brought unto. There are some, who are like <HI>Paul,</HI> to do more for GOD in a way of <HI>Active Obedience,</HI> than others. There are some, who are like <HI>Job,</HI> to do more than others for GOD in a way of <HI>Passive</HI> Obedience. Now, such as the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD shall do but little good upon, these will not be furnished for what he will have some be call'd unto. There must be some who shall <HI>Excell</HI> in <HI>Fruitfulness,</HI> because of some <HI>Excellent Work,</HI> which GOD has intended for them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. All the truiy <HI>Fruitful Hearers</HI> of the Gospel, will <HI>Increase</HI> in their <HI>Fruitfulness.</HI> Concerning the <HI>Fruit</HI> on the <HI>Good Ground,</HI> we read, Mar. IV. 8. <HI>It sprang up, and Increased.</HI> That <HI>Obedience</HI> to GOD, which his <HI>Word</HI> brings any Person to, will certain∣ly be a <HI>growing Obedience,</HI> and they that are in it will <HI>Wax stronger and stronger.</HI> If there be no <HI>Growth</HI> in our PIETY, we may suspect the <HI>Truth</HI> of our PIETY. We find, Joh. XV. 2. <HI>That which bears Fruit,</HI> must and will <HI>bring forth more Fruit.</HI> When we first begin to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto GOD, there is as the Apostle said unto some of old, <HI>Something lacking in it.</HI> But our GOD will have it Proceed, and Improve, and <HI>Increase</HI> to fur∣ther Degrees; It shall see an <HI>Increasing of GOD.</HI> A <HI>Sincere</HI> and <HI>New-born</HI> and <HI>Living</HI> Child of GOD, will be a <HI>Growing</HI> one. Of the <HI>Faithful</HI> and the <HI>Fruitful,</HI> we read, Hos. XIV. 5. <HI>He shall grow as the Lilly;</HI> of which they say, It <HI>grows</HI> as long as it
<PB N="85" REF="002905_0090_0FE69189A5E9C3C8"/><HI>lives.</HI> If we be <HI>Rooted</HI> in Him, who is our GOD and our Life, His Interest will be continually <HI>Growing</HI> in us.</P>
<P>O Hearer of the <HI>Word,</HI> come under a <HI>Trial</HI> that is now to be passed upon thee.</P>
<P>If thou art a <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> thou wilt be upon the <HI>Increase</HI> in thy <HI>Fruitfulness.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, will <HI>Increase</HI> in his <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with the Glorious CHRIST, who is the very <HI>Sum</HI> of all the <HI>Word.</HI> It is requi∣red, 2. Pet. III. 18. <HI>Grow in the Grace and Know∣ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> He sees more and more <HI>Glory</HI> in a lovely JESUS; <HI>How great his Goodness and his Beauty!</HI> He has more and more sense of the <HI>Miseries,</HI> which without a CHRIST he lies exposed unto: And he becomes more and more sensible of the <HI>Alsufficiency</HI> in a CHRIST for the Relief of all his <HI>Miseries.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> will <HI>Increase</HI> in his <HI>Ability</HI> to Repel <HI>Temptations</HI> to Sin against the <HI>Word.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> can't so <HI>easily</HI> prevail upon him, as once he could. He can more <HI>easily</HI> Deny him∣self of those <HI>Pleasures</HI> and <HI>Profits</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> with which the <HI>Devil</HI> allures Men into Folly. The Variety of <HI>Conditions</HI> thro' which he passes; he more <HI>easily</HI> bears them, and more <HI>easily</HI> avoids the Errors incident unto them, He is less enchanted with <HI>Prosperity:</HI> It proves not such a <HI>Dalilah,</HI> to lay him asleep in sinful stupefactions. He is less disturbed with <HI>Adversity:</HI> He gains in the <HI>strength</HI> which keeps him from <HI>Fainting</HI> in the <HI>Day</HI> of it.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, will <HI>Increase</HI> in his awful Resentments of the <HI>Everlasting Invisibles,</HI> whereof we are advised in the <HI>Word.</HI> He becomes
<PB N="86" REF="002905_0091_0FE69189C62DECA8"/>more Awed by the Apprehension of <HI>GOD knowing the way that he takes.</HI> He becomes more afraid of <HI>Grieving the Holy SPIRIT of GOD,</HI> by any Miscar∣riages. He becomes more lothe to disoblige the <HI>Good Angels,</HI> and gratify the <HI>Evil</HI> ones, by any Misbehaviours. He is more Swayed by the Hopes of the great Recompence, in the <HI>spiritual Blessings</HI> of the <HI>Heavenly places;</HI> and he is more affected with <HI>the Terror of the Lord;</HI> a <HI>Destruction from GOD</HI> is more of a <HI>Terror</HI> unto him.</P>
<P>Finally. A <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, will <HI>Increase</HI> in the <HI>Conformity</HI> of his whole <HI>Conversation</HI> to the <HI>Word.</HI> He becomes more full of <HI>Meditati∣ons</HI> on <HI>Things pertaining to the Kingdom of GOD:</HI> More frequent, and more fervent in <HI>Supplications</HI> to the <HI>Throne of Grace.</HI> He becomes a greater <HI>Sa∣crificer;</HI> and more abounding in the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> which <HI>GOD is well-pleased withal.</HI> He makes notable Ad∣vances, in a <HI>Cleansing from all Filthiness of the Flesh and of the Spirit;</HI> and carrying on <HI>Holiness</HI> towards <HI>Perfection in the fear of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Sanctification</HI> of his <HI>whole,</HI> ever. <HI>Spirit, and Soul, and Body,</HI> is carried on, thro' <HI>the presence of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Hearken, <HI>O Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word:</HI> A <HI>Non-profi∣ciency</HI> under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD; Oh! 'Twould be a Black Token of <HI>Death</HI> upon you!</P>
<P N="5">V. We cannot be <HI>Fruitful Hearers</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> except we also <HI>persist</HI> in our <HI>Fruitfulness.</HI> Of the Hearers who are <HI>Good Ground,</HI> we read; Luk. VIII. 15. <HI>They bring forth Fruit with Patience.</HI></P>
<P>But, what is intended in this <HI>Patience?</HI></P>
<P>First; There is no <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, but what shall be <HI>Tried</HI> by some <HI>Affliction,</HI> whether he will continue to bring forth <HI>Fruit,</HI> or no; And
<PB N="87" REF="002905_0092_0FE691F30AC6F8E0"/>be <HI>Tried</HI> what <HI>Fruit</HI> it is, that he does bring forth unto GOD. There is no Disciple of the Lord who died on the <HI>Cross,</HI> but what has a <HI>Cross</HI> pro∣vided for him. The first <HI>Maxim</HI> that our Lord lays down for every Disciple, is, Mat. XVI. 24. <HI>Let him deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me. Patience</HI> is a Vertue disposing us to Love, and Serve, and Obey, our SAVIOUR under the <HI>Cross.</HI> There is no <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> without some <HI>Affliction:</HI> Indeed, with the Chosen of GOD, the more <HI>Af∣fliction,</HI> the more <HI>Fruitfulness.</HI> The Name of the Believer, is <HI>Ephraim;</HI> Inasmuch as GOD makes him <HI>Fruitful in the Land of his Affliction.</HI> Where∣fore, we are to <HI>Run with Patience,</HI> thro' all that is <HI>before us.</HI> Look for it, O Believer; Look for <HI>Af∣fliction</HI> to try thy <HI>Patience.</HI> And let this be taken, as one Intimation here doubtless given by our SA∣VIOUR; A Man may not be esteemed a <HI>Fruitful</HI> Man, until he be a <HI>Patient</HI> one. You must be People <HI>of Sorrows and acquainted with Griefs:</HI> You must meet with <HI>Bereavements,</HI> meet with <HI>Injuries,</HI> meet with <HI>Reproaches:</HI> As being under a <HI>Crucifixi∣on,</HI> you must suffer one Dolorous <HI>Pang</HI> after ano∣ther, and suffer such a <HI>Succession</HI> of them, that one shall no sooner be a little over, but another will come on; until the <HI>Mercystroke</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> open an Outgate for you. Now, How do you <HI>Bear</HI> these Things? If you Bear them with <HI>Patience,</HI> then you <HI>Bear Fruit with Patience.</HI> Man, If thou hast a <HI>Froward</HI> Soul, thou hast not a <HI>Fruitful</HI> one!</P>
<P>Secondly. Nor was any one ever a <HI>Fruitful Hearer</HI> of the Word, but such as did continue to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto the end. As we are told, Psal. XCII. 11. <HI>They shall still bring forth Fruit in
<PB N="88" REF="002905_0093_0FE69191C550A820"/>old Age.</HI> Even so, <HI>They shall still bring forth Fruit until the very Period of their Lives.</HI> The <HI>Harvest</HI> of that <HI>Fruit</HI> which we are to yield, will not come, until the World to come. With <HI>Patience</HI> then, we must hold on, and hold out, yielding <HI>Fruit</HI> as long as we are in this World. <HI>Perseverance; Perseve∣rance!</HI> This is that <HI>Patience,</HI> with which we are to <HI>bring forth Fruit</HI> unto GOD. An <HI>Apostate</HI> Sinner, was always an <HI>Unfruitful</HI> Sinner. The <HI>Good Fruits</HI> of such an one, were never any other than meer <HI>Shows</HI> of Good. Soul, Hast thou Begun to be <HI>Fruitful?</HI> O Tremble at a <HI>Degeneracy</HI> from hopeful Beginnings. If thy <HI>Goodness</HI> be what soon <HI>passeth away,</HI> the Glorious GOD, as in a Deliberation what Vengeance to take upon it, says, <HI>What shall I do unto thee? What shall I do unto thee?</HI> It is a Terrible Thing that He will <HI>do unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>And now, We are come to, <HI>The Conclusion of the Matter.</HI></P>
<P>You are now determined, What is the <HI>Good Soil,</HI> and that which alone may look for <HI>Good,</HI> and will come to <HI>Good,</HI> and which <HI>brings forth Fruits meet</HI> for the Cultivation used upon it, and <HI>receiveth Blessing from GOD.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Desirable Thing</HI> whereto you are now to be Exhorted, is This; Oh! Become sollicitous, that you may under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, be as the <HI>Good Ground, Fruitful</HI> from the <HI>Seed</HI> cast upon it; Become Importunate for the <HI>Good Heart</HI> which may make you and prove you to be such <HI>Good Ground</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>In the prosecution of this EXHORTATION, there are three <HI>Counsils</HI> from GOD, yea, <HI>Charges,</HI> to be in the Name of GGD, earnestly press'd up∣on you.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="002905_0094_0FE69191E025BC80"/>
First. <HI>Examine</HI> your selves, O all you that are our <HI>Hearers,</HI> Examine your selves, what <HI>Fruit</HI> the Gospel has had with you; What <HI>Fruit</HI> you have heard the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD withal. The GOD of Heaven, who does require <HI>Fruit</HI> from the <HI>Soil,</HI> and the <HI>Soul,</HI> on which He has bestowed the <HI>Seed</HI> of His <HI>Word,</HI> He does also Enquire, what is the <HI>Fruit</HI> of all His Tillage. He says; Luk. XIII. 7. <HI>Behold, I come, seeking Fruit.</HI> But now, Enquire of thy self, O Hearer of the Gospel; Enquire Se∣riously, Thoroughly, Impartially; <HI>What Fruit has the Word of GOD my SAVIOUR produced in me; and what am I the Better, under and after my Enjoyment of the Glorious Gospel?</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> wherein the <HI>Wrath of GOD has been Revealed from Heaven, against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of Men,</HI> Enquire, whether the <HI>Fruit</HI> of it has been seen, in your being Reclaimed from all <HI>Ungodliness</HI> and <HI>Unrigh∣teousness.</HI> The <HI>Word,</HI> which <HI>Converts the Soul,</HI> and <HI>makes wise the Simple,</HI> and <HI>Rejoices the Heart,</HI> and <HI>Enlightens the Eyes,</HI> Enquire, whether the <HI>Fruit</HI> of it has been seen, in your having a <HI>Soul Converted,</HI> and <HI>made Wise,</HI> and <HI>Rejoiced,</HI> and <HI>Enlightened</HI> by it.</P>
<P>There are especially <HI>Four Questions</HI> which I ve∣hemently urge you to Retire and ponder on.</P>
<P>Quest. I <HI>Have I ever yet had Experience of a Re∣generation from the Word of Truth? And has the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, by His Word so Quickned me for Living to Him, and given such a New Biass to me, as to make a New Creature of me?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. II. <HI>Is there no Evil which the Word of GOD has rebuked me for, yet left unreformed with me?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="002905_0095_0FE691F342FB8CC0"/>
Quest. III. <HI>Is there no Duty which the Word of GOD has convinced me of, yet left unperformed with me?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. IV. <HI>Have I left nothing undone, which is necessary to be done, that my dying Hour may not be fearfully uneasy to me?</HI></P>
<P>The Answers to these <HI>Questions</HI> will soon dis∣cover, how Defective you may still be in your <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> under the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD. I beseech you to take these important <HI>Questions</HI> into a just Consideration.</P>
<P>Secondly. You must become <HI>United</HI> unto your SAVIOUR, by <HI>Believing</HI> on Him, that so the Gospel may have its <HI>Fruit</HI> with you; and that so you may not be numbred among them, of whom it shall be said, <HI>The Word preached does not profit them.</HI> The very First and Main <HI>Fruit</HI> of the Gos∣pel to be demanded of you, is This; Give your selves up to your SAVIOUR, and be willing to be <HI>found in Him.</HI> This is the First Thing to be proposed and pursued in order to all further <HI>Fruit∣fulness.</HI> Remember, That you never will be <HI>Fruitful,</HI> until you are first united unto your SA∣VIOUR, by Repairing to Him for all Good, and by Believing on Him, who tells us, Joh: XV. 5. <HI>Without me, you can do nothing.</HI> The <HI>Good Works,</HI> which are the <HI>Fruits of Righteousness,</HI> commanded of GOD; Remember this; They are not Things to be done by an <HI>Unrenewed Mind,</HI> and a Soul not yet <HI>United</HI> unto our SAVIOUR. Tis <HI>Faith</HI> which is to do all these <HI>Good Works,</HI> and yield all these <HI>Good Fruits.</HI> It must be the <HI>Obedience of Faith,</HI> which does them all, yields them all. The <HI>First Thing</HI> to be propounded with you, is, To fly unto
<PB N="92" REF="002905_0096_0FE6919358ECAD20"/>a Glorious CHRIST, and beg of him to make you <HI>his own,</HI> and comply with all his <HI>Offers of Grace:</HI> More particularly, Ask of him, Trust in him, that by Him <HI>living in you,</HI> you may <HI>be made perfect in e∣very good work.</HI> Christian, Thy SAVIOUR says unto thee, <HI>From me is thy Fruit found.</HI> Let it be the <HI>Echo</HI> from thy Soul unto him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, by thee acting in me, let me be made a Soyl fruitful unto GOD.</HI> I wish the People of GOD were aware of it; The want of such <HI>Divinity,</HI> in our Sermons, has proved almost the loss of <HI>Christianity</HI> under them.</P>
<P>Thirdly; Be <HI>Prayerful</HI> that you may be <HI>Fruitful.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Prayer</HI> it self is no little part of the <HI>Fruit</HI> that is called for. <HI>Prayerless</HI> ones, besure are <HI>Fruit∣less</HI> ones. There appear no <HI>Fruits</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> until that sprouts up; Act. IX. 11. <HI>Behold, He prays.</HI> This, This is to be one special Article of our <HI>Prayer; My GOD, Bestow thou the Blessings of a fruitful Soul upon me.</HI></P>
<P>But then, more particularly, <HI>Pray</HI> over the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, wherewith you are <HI>Highly favoured</HI> of the Lord. Before your <HI>Hearing</HI> of it, make that <HI>Prayer, Lord, Let thy Word find my Heart prepared for it.</HI> After your <HI>Hearing</HI> of it, Think, <HI>What fresh matter of Prayer have I now been minded of?</HI> In <HI>Hearing,</HI> turn all you <HI>Hear</HI> into <HI>Prayer,</HI> as much as ever you can: Send up your Wishes tied unto the <HI>Arrows</HI> of <HI>Ejaculatory Prayer;</HI> send them up to Hea∣ven as thick as you can. <HI>Fruitful, Fruitful</HI> will that <HI>Earth</HI> be, which in this way obtains the <HI>Sweet In∣fluences</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> upon it.—</P>
<P>But I may not forget one Advice more to be introduced before I leave you.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="002905_0097_0FE691F4948E4888"/>
Our COMPANY will be a Thing of more than a little Consequence to our PIETY. Our <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> in all the <HI>Good Works</HI> of PIETY, will very much depend on the <HI>Company</HI> with which we chuse to be most <HI>Familiar.</HI> A Grand Maxim of Wisdom, and of the best <HI>Husbandry,</HI> is, <HI>Forsake the Foolish and live.</HI> We have read of one whose <HI>Field</HI> was in a Bad Condition, He got it by being <HI>A∣mongst</HI> those who were not as they should be.</P>
<P>For the Inculcation of this <HI>Caution,</HI> I will set before you <HI>Two Laws,</HI> which the <HI>Holy One of Israel</HI> gave to His People concerning the <HI>Ancient Hus∣bandry.</HI></P>
<P>One Law was; Deut. XXII. 10. <HI>Thou shalt not Plow with an Ox and an Ass together.</HI> The Con∣junction of Animals that are of so unequal a <HI>Na∣ture</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> was doubtless a <HI>Magical Rite,</HI> invented by the Devil to be used by Men, in Token of their Dependence on him for <HI>Fruitful Fields.</HI> There can be no Reason but <HI>Magic</HI> found for such an improper <HI>Conjugation. Homer,</HI> and all the World, have decried the Nonsense and Folly and <HI>Madness</HI> of it; and it was look'd upon as e∣nough to proclaim <HI>Ulysses</HI> a <HI>Madman.</HI> But the Devil singularly delights in <HI>Confusion,</HI> and in all Contradiction to the <HI>GOD of Order.</HI> The <HI>Ox</HI> was a Sacrifice to the <HI>Dii Superi;</HI> the <HI>Ass,</HI> a Sacrifice to the <HI>Dii Inferi.</HI> Both sorts of Deities were <HI>Sa∣cramentally</HI> called upon, when these were in the <HI>Yoke together.</HI></P>
<P>But, was there nothing else designed in forbid∣ding this <HI>Diabolical Sacrament?</HI> The Jews in their <HI>Baal-Hatturin</HI> tell us, There was this thing Mys∣tically taught us in it, <HI>That the Righteous and the
<PB N="93" REF="002905_0098_0FE691938316D520"/>Wicked should avoid Commerce with one another.</HI> Yea, <HI>Bochart</HI> is of the Opinion, that our Apostle did allude unto this very <HI>Law,</HI> when he forbids our being <HI>unequally yoked with Unbelievers.</HI> Christian, It will marvellously creeple thee, to be <HI>yoked</HI> with <HI>Unbelievers,</HI> and with such as indeed will <HI>Draw a∣nother way</HI> than what thy Soul tends unto.</P>
<P>Another Law was; Lev. XIX 19. <HI>Thou shalt not sow thy Field, with a mingled Seed.</HI> No doubt, the Original of this Injunction was this; There was, as <HI>Maimonides</HI> tells us, a Superstition of the <HI>Zabians,</HI> to sow <HI>Barley</HI> and <HI>Raisins</HI> together, that they might procure to their <HI>Fields,</HI> a singular Pros∣perity and Felicity. Our <HI>Selden</HI> finds among the Old <HI>Athenians,</HI> what a little resembles it. The old <HI>Idolaters</HI> joined a <HI>Male</HI> God, and a <HI>Female</HI> in their Acknowledgements. And <HI>Varro</HI> writing, <HI>De Re Rustica,</HI> directs this, to obtain a Success for their Tillage. Thus the vain <HI>Idolaters,</HI> looking on the god of the <HI>Vine,</HI> as a <HI>Male,</HI> and the god of the <HI>Grain</HI> as a <HI>Female;</HI> they would by the Rice of a <HI>Mixed Seed</HI> unite them, that so they might have a <HI>lucky Vintage.</HI></P>
<P>But, Methinks, I see a further Intent in this <HI>Law.</HI> There have been <HI>Two Seeds</HI> in the World, ever since the <HI>Third Chapter</HI> of <HI>Genesis; Two Seeds</HI> very different from one another. Syrs, These <HI>Two Seeds</HI> will never do well together. Let them them keep at a due Distance from one another. The <HI>Work of GOD</HI> in your Souls will not thrive, if you do not <HI>save your selves from the untoward Ge∣neration.</HI> As for them who are evidently a <HI>Seed of Evil doers, and Children that are Corrupters,</HI> the Voice from Heaven to you is; <HI>Come out from a∣mong
<PB N="94" REF="002905_0099_0FE6929D728EA468"/>them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and I will receive you; yea, I will be a Father unto you; and ye shall be my Sons and my Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; Methinks, The <HI>Husbandry</HI> of <HI>Ashes,</HI> may here agreeably enough have some Notice taken of it.</P>
<P>When we read; Psal. CXLVII. 16. <HI>He scatters the Hoar-frost like Ashes,</HI> it seems Allusive to what was done by the ancient <HI>Husbandmen.</HI> We often find it in Books of <HI>Agriculture,</HI> a Receit for En∣riching of <HI>Ground</HI> that has been spent, or worn out. There is a <HI>Salt</HI> in <HI>Plants,</HI> which is their pro∣per Aliment or Nutriment; and the more of that <HI>Salt</HI> there is in any thing, the better <HI>Dung</HI> it will yield for the producing of a <HI>fruitful Soil.</HI> Now that <HI>Salt</HI> remains in the <HI>Ashes</HI> of the <HI>Plants,</HI> after the <HI>Fire</HI> has done its part upon them. We see our <HI>Husbandmen,</HI> ever now and then burning little Heaps of Rubbish here and there on their <HI>New∣plough'd Ground. Virgil</HI> speaks of such a Practice diverse times in his <HI>Georgicks.</HI> In all probability the <HI>Hsbandmen</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> did so too. They scatter∣ed <HI>Ashes</HI> here and there on their <HI>Fields;</HI> or per∣haps, they cast <HI>Ashes</HI> on their <HI>Dunghills,</HI> where, be∣ing diluted by the <HI>Rains,</HI> the <HI>Salt</HI> very deeply im∣pregnated them; and rendred them fitter to be spread afterwards upon the Earth.</P>
<P>But now, What I would be at, is, To employ the <HI>Husbandry of Ashes,</HI> for the producing of a <HI>fruitful Soul.</HI> And it is to be managed by seri∣ous and frequent <HI>Meditations</HI> on Two <HI>Heaps of Ashes</HI> which we are all deeply concerned in. Such <HI>Meditations</HI> are the most <HI>Fertilizing</HI> Things that
<PB N="95" REF="002905_0100_0FE64697CEB434B8"/>can be imagined; It will be a <HI>fruitful Soyl,</HI> that shall be impregnated with them.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Meditate,</HI> O Dying Man, on the <HI>Ashes,</HI> which thy <HI>Grave</HI> will shortly reduce thee to: <HI>Dust and Ashes!</HI> Often take a View of thy <HI>Flesh</HI> as <HI>Inci∣nerated</HI> in the <HI>Grave.</HI> And Think, <HI>What will all this World be to me, when I am laid up in the dusty Cham∣bers of the House appointed for all the Living!</HI> Think; <HI>What have I to do, that I may with Courage and Com∣fort go down unto the Chambers?</HI> The <HI>Fruits</HI> of such Thoughts will be Wonderful!</P>
<P>Secondiy. <HI>Meditate</HI> very much on the <HI>Ashes</HI> which will cover the Face of the Earth, when the <HI>Flames</HI> that are now quickly to be looked for, have done their part upon it. If the <HI>coming of the Son of Man in the Clouds of Heaven,</HI> which cannot mean any other than His <HI>Personal</HI> and <HI>Visible</HI> Coming, must be at and for the Destruction of the <HI>Roman</HI> (Papal) Monarchy, which must be given up to <HI>Burning Flames!</HI> If the <HI>Second coming</HI> of our Lord, which will be in <HI>Flaming Fire,</HI> must be at and for the Perdition of the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> who has now run thro' his Period of <HI>Twelve hundred and sixty Years;</HI> If the promised Felicities for the Church upon <HI>Earth,</HI> take not place before the <HI>New Earth;</HI> And, if the <HI>New Earth</HI> arrive not before, but must be brought in by, the <HI>Conflagration</HI> which will make a dreadful Havock <HI>on the Earth, and the Works</HI> that are in it; Then, we know not how soon the <HI>Earth</HI> must undergo the tremendous Revolution, which the XXIV. Chapter of <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s Prophecies, and a thou∣sand other Inspired Oracles, have described and foretold unto us. Were this awful Matter so Re∣alized, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be, what <HI>Fruits</HI> would there
<PB N="96" REF="002905_0101_0FE6927A13763938"/>be of it; and <HI>what manner of Persons would it ren∣der us, in all holy Conversation and Godliness!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Consider what I say;</HI> And the Lord <HI>give you Un∣derstanding.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Pluviaria. The RAIN waited for.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Isa. V. 6.</BIBL>
<P><HI>I will command the Clouds, that they Rain no Rain upon it.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Most awful Judgment of GOD! If we take it <HI>Figuratively</HI> or <HI>Literally,</HI> tis a most awful Judgment of GOD.</P>
<P>At a <HI>Vintage</HI> of old, their Usage was to have Songs of Mirth and Joy; In the <HI>Vineyards</HI> there would be Singing, with glad Shouts and Accla∣mations. But behold here, a Song over the Vine∣yard of GOD, which is <HI>Carmen Lugubre;</HI> a very Mournful one, and fitted for Sighs and Lamenta∣tions. The Church of GOD is very fitly com∣pared unto a <HI>Vineyard.</HI> His Church among the Jews, was now become a <HI>Degenerate Vineyard.</HI> The <HI>Impieties</HI> abounding in that Church, were <HI>Sowre Grapes,</HI> which very poorly answered the Divine
<PB N="99" REF="002905_0104_0FE6927A2FF2A498"/>Cultivation, that had been employed upon the <HI>Vinerard.</HI> The Glorious GOD is introduced, as expressing His just Resentments upon the <HI>Ill Fruits</HI> found in a People that had been so richly Culti∣vated. One of the Punishments threatned unto the <HI>Unfruitful Vineyard,</HI> is in this Article; <HI>I will command the Clouds, that they Rain no Rain upon it.</HI> The Interpretation of the <HI>Parable,</HI> and of this Ar∣ticle in it, which I find in the Writings of the <HI>Ancients,</HI> when I <HI>seek Understanding from them,</HI> is to this purpose;
<Q>It was accomplished, when GOD sent away His <HI>Apostles</HI> from the Unbeliev∣ing and the Disobedient <HI>Jews,</HI> unto the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> when the Offers of the Gospel were no longer dispensed as they had been unto that Rejected People, but the saving Instructions and Influ∣ences of Heaven, were witheld from them; which they have now been for many Ages.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> which is now to <HI>distill as the Rain</HI> upon us, will be This.</P>
<P><HI>When the Glorious GOD commands His Clouds to shed no RAINS upon a People, tis a terrible Judg∣ment, and that whereof such a forsaken and un∣happy People should be very sensible.</HI></P>
<P>¶ Tis first in the <HI>Figurative Sense</HI> of it, that we will take the <HI>Terrible Judgment</HI> into our serious Consideration. Tis in the witholding <HI>Evangelical Blessings</HI> from a Land, that GOD <HI>commands</HI> the <HI>Clouds,</HI> to distil <HI>no Rains</HI> upon it. This is now to be considered as a Judgment of a very sad Impor∣tance: O our dear People, not yet visited with it, I hope, you will apprehend it so, and accor∣dingly deprecate it!</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="100" REF="002905_0105_0FE646A3C8A97FB0"/>
I. We will enquire, first; <HI>When</HI> may a People have it said of them, That GOD <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to distil <HI>no Rain</HI> upon them?</P>
<P>In general; Tis when a People have not the <HI>Ministry of the Gospel,</HI> to bring them home unto GOD.</P>
<P>By the Rain here spoken of, tis agreed among Expositors, That <HI>Coelestis Doctrina,</HI> or, Heavenly Instructions are intended. It is well known, That in the Hebrew Language, both the <HI>Raining</HI> of Heaven, and the <HI>Teaching</HI> of Heaven, are expres∣sed in Terms that come from the same Root. Even the Margin of the Bible in our Translation, gives us a notable intimation of This; at Joel II. 23. <HI>He hath given you the former Rain.</HI> In your Margin tis, <HI>A Teacher of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>In the Sacred Scriptures, we find the <HI>Teachers of Truth,</HI> resembled unto the <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven. To these there may be applied that Word, Isa. LX. 8. <HI>Who are these, that fly as a Cloud?</HI> No wonder then, that the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, which is taught by these, is resembled unto <HI>Rain.</HI> These are they who may say, Deut. XXXII. 2. <HI>My Speech shall distil as the small Rain upon the tender Herb, and as the Showers upon the Grass.</HI> Now,</P>
<P>First; When the Glorious GOD bestows not Able and Faithful Ministers of His Gospel on a People, then He <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to distil <HI>no Rain</HI> upon them. The more Useful <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, are sometimes <HI>taken away</HI> from a Peo∣ple. Perhaps <HI>Persecution</HI> Banishes them, or Silen∣ces them; The <HI>Tail of the Dragon</HI> strikes them down from Heaven. Or, the ordinary Course of
<PB N="101" REF="002905_0106_0FE646A3D9DC0A78"/><HI>Mortality</HI> takes them off, without Successors com∣ing on. The <HI>Teachers</HI> are no more to be <HI>seen,</HI> be∣cause of their being <HI>removed</HI> into the <HI>Dark Corner</HI> of the Grave. The <HI>Clouds</HI> that should have <HI>Rain∣ed</HI> the <HI>Word of Life</HI> upon a People, are blown out of <HI>the</HI> World, when they have no <HI>Ministers,</HI> to be the Dispensers of the Gospel unto them. Yea, a People may have pretended <HI>Ministers,</HI> and yet have this <HI>Curse</HI> upon them. They may have <HI>Men in Black,</HI> that yet shall be <HI>no Divines,</HI> nor any better than so many <HI>Chemarims</HI> unto them: Or, Men that <HI>wear Garments only to deceive:</HI> And, Men that being the <HI>Corruption of the Best Thing,</HI> are <HI>the worst Thing</HI> that can be; Mankind has a <HI>Transcendent Pest</HI> in such <HI>Dissemblers</HI> and <HI>Stage players.</HI> Of such we read, Jude 12. <HI>They are Clouds without Water.</HI> A People may have, <HI>Ignorant,</HI> or <HI>Erroneous,</HI> or <HI>Vi∣cious Ministers;</HI> and such as distil no <HI>Rains</HI> of Hea∣ven on the Souls of the People, but rather instil <HI>Poison</HI> into them. There are <HI>Ministers</HI> who are meer <HI>Good-for-nothings:</HI> Their chief Talent lies at making of <HI>Christless Christians.</HI> If they should over∣come Sloth so far as to do something like <HI>Preach∣ing</HI> an hundred times in a Year, there is not one right <HI>Gospel Sermon</HI> among all their Harangues. They are such Bunglers at <HI>Praying,</HI> that it would shamefully expose them, to put them upon it. Their <HI>Conversations</HI> are so Mean, so Vain, so Licentious, that the <HI>Blind lead the Blind,</HI> when the People are so left of GOD, as to follow them: <HI>Unsavoury Salt, fit only to be trodden under Foot of Men!</HI> Ah, Miserable People! GOD witholds <HI>Clouds</HI> of Hea∣venly <HI>Rain,</HI> from such a People. Nay, He <HI>Rains Brimstone on their Habitations.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="002905_0107_0FE6927B921A71F8"/>
More than so, Secondly; When a People that sit under <HI>Good Ministers,</HI> do <HI>get no Good</HI> by them; then GOD <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to distil no <HI>Rain</HI> upon them. The Holy SPIRIT of GOD giving <HI>Efficacy</HI> to His Word, is likened aptly enough un∣to the <HI>Rain.</HI> It may be said of Him therein, as Hos. VI. 3. <HI>He shall come unto us as the Rain; as the latter and former Rain unto the Earth.</HI> People may have <HI>Ministers</HI> that shall be Fat <HI>Clouds,</HI> and full of <HI>Rain.</HI> But, if GOD leave this People, without any <HI>Impressions of Grace</HI> from His Holy SPIRIT, by His <HI>Word</HI> in the Mouth of such <HI>Ministers,</HI> here is a People not <HI>Rained</HI> upon. A People may have Excellent <HI>Ministers;</HI> such as are truly <HI>Men of GOD,</HI> and, <HI>Able Ministers of the New-Testament:</HI> And yet, the People may <HI>go on still in their Trespasses.</HI> The <HI>Ministers</HI> may be, <HI>Burning and Shining Lights;</HI> And yet, the People remain <HI>in Darkness,</HI> and never <HI>know the things of their Peace.</HI> The <HI>Ministers</HI> may be <HI>Good Men,</HI> and zealous for GOD; And yet, the People not by their Means <HI>turned unto the Lord.</HI> All the Pains taken by the <HI>Ministers</HI> with the Peo∣ple, are lost upon them. The People continue the <HI>Children of Unperswadeableness,</HI> tho' the <HI>Ministers</HI> do all they can for the <HI>perswading</HI> of them to <HI>Be∣lieve</HI> on CHRIST, and <HI>Repent</HI> of Sin, and lead <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Sober</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> Lives. The Holy SPIRIT of GOD, affords not His <HI>Efficacy</HI> to make all Effectual. The cursed Mountains of <HI>Gilboa,</HI> are not left so much without <HI>Rain,</HI> as the Souls of such a People.</P>
<P N="2">II. We will Enquire, next; What will be the <HI>Consequence</HI> of such a <HI>Judgment;</HI> and what there
<PB N="103" REF="002905_0108_0FE646AB44EAE170"/>is, that should make it appear <HI>Terrible</HI> unto us?</P>
<P>First. When the <HI>Clouds</HI> distil no <HI>Rains</HI> on the Souls of Men, the <HI>worst Famine</HI> that can be, will follow upon it. There will follow that <HI>Famine;</HI> Amos VIII. 11. <HI>Not a Famine of Bread, nor a Thirst for Water; but of hearing the Words of the Lord. A Bodily Famine</HI> is a Judgment, than which there is none more dreaded among the Children of Men. The King of <HI>Israel</HI> had cause enough to put the Denomination of, <HI>The Evil,</HI> upon it. When the Glorious GOD is going to <HI>spend His Arrows</HI> on a sinful World, He comes to an Extremity in this; <HI>I will send the evil Arrows of Famine upon them.</HI> O Dismal Case! Wherein the Torture is Intolera∣ble! Men devour their own Flesh; Women de∣vour the Infants at their Breasts; A lingring Tor∣ment brings a fierce Rage, and a slow Death, upon the Miferables! How pathetically is it set forth; and how Lamentably! Lam. IV. 9. <HI>They that be slain with the Sword are better of it, than they that be slain with Hunger; for these pine away strick∣en through for want of the fruits of the Field.</HI> But now, they that are <HI>slain with a Famine of Bread and a Thirst for Water,</HI> are <HI>better of it, than they that are slain</HI> with a <HI>Famine of hearing the Words of the Lord.</HI> For these <HI>pine away in their Sins;</HI> They are <HI>stricken through for want of the Fruits</HI> that are to bring and keep their Souls in Life; They go down to Eternal Burnings; Weeping and Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth, in a <HI>Destruction from GOD,</HI> is what they are eternally damn'd unto.</P>
<P>Secondly. To enjoy the <HI>Clouds</HI> which distil <HI>Rains</HI> on our Souls, tis an <HI>High Favour</HI> of Heaven. Then tis a <HI>Sore Judgment</HI> of Heaven, to be depri∣ved
<PB N="104" REF="002905_0109_0FE646AB5337E430"/>of such Enjoyments. If People should under∣go many <HI>Difficulties,</HI> yet the <HI>Clouds</HI> distilling <HI>Rains</HI> on their Souls, would make amends for their dif∣ficult Circumstances. Thus we read; Isa. XXX. 20. <HI>Tho' the Lord give you the Bread of Adversity, and the Water of Affliction, yet thine Eyes shall see thy Teachers.</HI> But, Ah, Abandoned People! If your <HI>Eyes</HI> can see no <HI>Teachers,</HI> you are worse of it, than any scarcity of <HI>Bread</HI> or of <HI>Water</HI> can render you. They are a <HI>Blessed People,</HI> who have the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, with the <HI>Ordinances of Heaven</HI> which it leads them to. An <HI>Undone People</HI> then they that have none of these things. When this <HI>Good Part</HI> is <HI>taken away,</HI> the <HI>Best Thing</HI> a People can have, is <HI>taken away.</HI> They have then the <HI>worst Thing</HI> that can be befalling of them. The People are <HI>lifted up to Heaven</HI> that are made partakers of such Heavenly Priviledges, as the <HI>Clouds</HI> distilling <HI>Rains</HI> on their Souls. Tis then a meer <HI>Hell upon Earth,</HI> to be de∣stitute of them. In the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD Men <HI>Eat the Food of Angels.</HI> When this <HI>Food</HI> is denied them, they are condemn'd and confin'd unto the <HI>Serpents Food,</HI> and have their Souls <HI>filled</HI> with nothing but what leaves them forever <HI>Empty;</HI> nothing but the <HI>Dust of the Earth.</HI> We read, Psal. LXXIX. 15. <HI>Blessed is the People that know the Joyful Sound.</HI> But then, Oh! the <HI>Curses</HI> that are poured out upon a People, who know nothing of the <HI>Joyful Sound!</HI> All the <HI>Curses</HI> that ever Mount <HI>Ebal</HI> roar'd withal, and enough to make a very <HI>Dreadful Sound!</HI> He was a Man of Right Sentiments, who said, <HI>I have esteemed the Words of thy Mouth more than my necessary Food.</HI> Then, if the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD be taken away, tis as bad as if our <HI>necessary Food</HI> were taken away.
<PB N="105" REF="002905_0110_0FE6927BAFB10F88"/><HI>Wandring Souls,</HI> Tis by the <HI>Perfect Law</HI> of GOD, that you are to be <HI>Converted. Simple Souls,</HI> Tis by the <HI>Sure Testimony</HI> of GOD, that you are to be <HI>made Wise. Dejected Hearts,</HI> Tis by the <HI>Right Statutes</HI> of GOD, that you are to be <HI>Rejoiced. Ig∣norant Minds,</HI> Tis by the <HI>pure Commandment</HI> of GOD, that you are to be <HI>Enlightened.</HI> What a <HI>Wretched∣ness</HI> to be deprived of all this <HI>Blessedness!</HI> What a <HI>Wrath unto the uttermost!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Tis a <HI>Judgment</HI> that <HI>goes not alone.</HI> If the <HI>Clouds</HI> distil no <HI>Rains</HI> on the Souls of the Peo∣ple, GOD has taken away the <HI>Signs</HI> of His <HI>Graci∣ous Presence</HI> from among them; They may be∣moan themselves, <HI>We see not our Signs,</HI> when there is <HI>no more any Prophet</HI> among them. The Lord Himself comes, where the <HI>Showers of His Word</HI> come. Hence, when the <HI>Showers</HI> of the Gospel are departed from a People, the Lord Himself is <HI>departed</HI> from them. <HI>This is the Burden from the Lord,</HI> upon them, <HI>I will even forsake you, saith the Lord.</HI> But, Oh! What a <HI>Word</HI> is That! Hos. IX. 12. <HI>Wo to them when I depart from them!</HI> And now, What ensues? All manner of <HI>Evil;</HI> And this Account of it, <HI>The Lord is not with us, and therefore all this is befallen us.</HI> A People so forsaken of GOD, must needs grow an <HI>Ungodly People. Satan</HI> has his <HI>Throne</HI> among them. From that <HI>Throne of Iniquity</HI> there issue out most venemous Operations. The People are all of them <HI>Captives</HI> to the <HI>Powers of Darkness,</HI> and the <HI>Prey of the Terrible Ones.</HI> GOD now <HI>makes Darkness,</HI> and <HI>it is Night,</HI> and the <HI>Beasts</HI> of the Pit <HI>creep forth,</HI> and the old Lions roar after their <HI>Prey,</HI> and the famished People become a <HI>Prey</HI> unto them. Their Character is That; <HI>Foolish,
<PB N="106" REF="002905_0111_0FE646AE9CC1E870"/>Disobedient, Deceived, serving diverse Lusts and Plea∣ures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another.</HI> O Rueful Condition! What <HI>Suburbs of Hell</HI> are we falling into! The People destitute of the <HI>Desirable Showers,</HI> are as <HI>Unloving</HI> as they are <HI>Ungodly,</HI> and are a <HI>continual Dropping</HI> to one another. The People make themselves to one another like the <HI>Bitter Waters,</HI> which the <HI>Star</HI> call∣ed <HI>Wormwood,</HI> fell into; and become Grievous <HI>Judgments</HI> upon one another. At the same time, they <HI>Ripen</HI> for all the <HI>Judgments</HI> of GOD, and <HI>Open</HI> the Floodgates for them, and have no Me∣thods of escaping them. Tis with them accor∣ding to that Report, 2 Chron. XV. 3, 5, 6. <HI>They were without a Teaching Priest, and without Law; And in those times, there was no Peace, for GOD vex∣ed them with all Adversity.</HI> Ah, Forlorn People; <HI>Sitting in Darkness, and in the Region of the sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dow of Death;</HI></P>
<P>But from these Things, let us make some In∣ferences.</P>
<P N="1">I. A People that have the <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven dis∣tilling Evangelical <HI>Rains</HI> upon them, should be Thankful to Him, who <HI>Covers the Heavens with Clouds, and who prepareth Rain for the Earth.</HI> It is the Glorious GOD, who <HI>Commands</HI> His <HI>Clouds,</HI> to distil His <HI>Rains</HI> upon them, O our Evangelized People; It is He, who <HI>by watering wearies the thick Cloud,</HI> and causes the <HI>Rain to come for His Land, and in Mercy.</HI> On such an Occasion a People are so called upon; <HI>Praise ye the Lord.</HI> I call to Mind a Passage; Psal. LXXXIV. 6. <HI>The Rain fills the Pools.</HI> My little Skill in Philology, finds, many Hebrew Words are so significant, that without any Danget
<PB N="107" REF="002905_0112_0FE646AEAF6842D0"/>or Damage, we may suppose a further Sense in them, than what is at first obvious. This Passage particularly may be read thus, <HI>The Teacher is filled with Blessings.</HI> O People Travelling to <HI>Zion,</HI> You often meet with such a Thing: A <HI>Teacher</HI> that is <HI>full of Blessings;</HI> A <HI>Cloud</HI> from and by which, the Blessed GOD <HI>Showers</HI> down a <HI>Poure</HI> of Blessings upon you. Is there a Countrey any where under the Cope of Heaven at this Day, <HI>Richer</HI> on this regard, than this <HI>poor</HI> Countrey? Behold, Thy Dense <HI>Clouds,</HI> O People <HI>known</HI> above the most of the <HI>Families of the Earth,</HI> Charg'd <HI>Clouds,</HI> from whence much of a Glorious CHRIST comes down, <HI>like Rain upon the mown Grass,</HI> like <HI>Showers that water the Earth.</HI> Yea, we read, Job XXXVII. II. Of, <HI>Bright Clouds;</HI> that is to say, <HI>Clouds</HI> that have <HI>Rainbows</HI> in them. There are <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Work of GOD in our Churches, which are such <HI>Bright Clouds;</HI> Young Men of growing <HI>Abi∣lities,</HI> and of settled <HI>Resolutions,</HI> to do all the Good that ever they can. These carry <HI>Rainbows</HI> with them, and comfortable <HI>Tokens,</HI> that our Churches will not as yet be overwhelmed in a General De∣solation. O Churches that so <HI>find Life and ob∣tain Favour of the Lord;</HI> Give Thanks, give Thanks to our Ascended JESUS, who <HI>gives these Gifts unto Men,</HI> and at the same time, <HI>sends a plentiful Rain,</HI> by which He <HI>confirms His weary Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> mentions among those which they call, <HI>The Fortunate Islands,</HI> one that is called, <HI>Pluviaria,</HI> because of the agreeable <HI>Rains</HI> which it is bless'd withal. Our Land may on the best Accounts be called, <HI>Pluviaria;</HI> None more happily <HI>Rained</HI> up∣on!</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="002905_0113_0FE69283A11DE3D8"/>
It becomes us now to do what may be done, that the <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven distilling Evangelical <HI>Rains,</HI> may be always afforded unto us; and that we may never suffer a <HI>Famine of the Gospel,</HI> from the <HI>Clouds</HI> desisting to <HI>Rain</HI> upon us. The <HI>Three Years and an half</HI> in which it <HI>Rained not</HI> in the Days of <HI>Elias,</HI> were a Type of the <HI>Twelve Hundred and sixty Years,</HI> which make <HI>Three Years and an half</HI> of <HI>Prophetical Days,</HI> that the Romish Antichrist is to famish the Nations. This Period being upon its Expiration, We may be in more hopes than ever, that if due Means be used, we shall obtain the <HI>Rains</HI> that are to be wished for. It is to be ho∣ped, that when our <HI>Elders give up the Ghost,</HI> our People shall yet know where to <HI>seek the Meat,</HI> that should <HI>relieve their Souls.</HI> In order to this;</P>
<P>First; The <HI>Clouds</HI> that bring the <HI>Rains,</HI> are to be fairly dealt withal. Indeed, if the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel are Men of no <HI>Merits.</HI> I am not aware of any <HI>Respects</HI> due to them. If they be <HI>Foolish</HI> and <HI>Selfish</HI> and <HI>Slothful</HI> Men, I know not why they should be Respected above other Men. If they are no better than <HI>Idol Shepherds,</HI> O Churches of GOD, Get rid of them as fast as you can. If they no∣toriously Miscarry, let not their <HI>Coat</HI> be a Shelter for their Miscarriages: It aggravates 'em! Well, But if Ministers have the True <HI>Spirit of the Gospel</HI> in them, and keep within the <HI>Commissions</HI> and the <HI>Directions</HI> of it, then in Abuses offered unto them, it may in some sort be said, <HI>Ambassadors</HI> are abu∣sed. GOD will call home His Injured <HI>Ambassa∣dors,</HI> and there come none after them, like those that went before them. Yea, It comes to that; 2 Chron. XXXVI. 16, <HI>They mocked the Messengers
<PB N="109" REF="002905_0114_0FE646B7C05C6C28"/>of GOD, and misused His Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord arose against His People, so far that there was no Remedy.</HI> Sometimes a People are blessed with <HI>Ministers</HI> who are Heavenly and Luminous <HI>Clouds</HI> over the Assemblies of <HI>Zion: Ministers</HI> that are <HI>the Beauty</HI> and the <HI>Defence</HI> of the Churches; <HI>Mi∣nisters</HI> that are conspicuously full of <HI>Knowledge</HI> and of <HI>Goodness.</HI> They discharge all their <HI>Offices,</HI> with great <HI>Capacity,</HI> with great <HI>Activity,</HI> with great <HI>Fidelity.</HI> They study to <HI>do Good,</HI> and they do abundance of <HI>Good.</HI> They are <HI>Tender Fathers</HI> to their Flocks; <HI>Praying</HI> for them, <HI>Watching</HI> for them, glad of all Opportunities to be useful unto them; Scattering their <HI>Alms</HI> and their other Kind∣nesses, like the Showers of Heaven among them. Of such <HI>Ministers,</HI> I was going to say, <HI>Make much of them.</HI> Without recalling that Word, I will say, <HI>Make Nothing of them.</HI> One of the Best among them said, 2 Cor. XII. 11. <HI>I am Nothing.</HI> If they are what they should be, you cannot more oblige them, than to see you looking thro' the <HI>Clouds,</HI> up to the <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> who makes them to be all that they are. They will count, that you ne∣ver carry it so well towards them, as when you take them to be <HI>Nothing</HI> but what their Glorious LORD makes them to be; and ascribe unto their LORD, the whole <HI>Glory</HI> of all the Good you find in them, and from them. Nevertheless, I may not leave unquoted those Words of our Apostle, 1 Thess. V. 12. <HI>We beseech you, Brethren, to know thens who Labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you, and esteem them very highly in Love for the sake of their Work.</HI> Yea, Let the <HI>Conscience</HI> in the Breast of the People, now do the part of
<PB N="110" REF="002905_0115_0FE646B7CEEA3CC0"/>a <HI>Preacher;</HI> And, O <HI>Conscience,</HI> Do thou Declare! —Is it not pity that such Benign <HI>Clouds</HI> of Hea∣ven should be misused? <HI>Pity,</HI> they should have their Spirits broken with Oppressive Necessities? <HI>Pity,</HI> they should be Reproached and Slandered, and insulted with many Indignities? <HI>Pity,</HI> that any <HI>prevailing Party</HI> should load them with such Expressions of Aversion for them, as may compel them to mourn before the Lord; <HI>A Bad-spirited People have killed me; have hastened my Death upon me!</HI> The GOD of <HI>Zacharias</HI> may <HI>look upon</HI> such Things, and not only <HI>take away</HI> the Blessings, but also say, <HI>Let no more such Clouds distil my Rains upon such a People!</HI></P>
<P>But inasmuch as there is very much <HI>Sacriledge</HI> committed in the Countrey, and many well de∣serving <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, do not receive a proper and a decent <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntainance,</HI> but suffer griev∣ous <HI>Afflictions</HI> and <HI>Oppressions,</HI> and scandalous <HI>De∣fraudations;</HI> I think it not unseasonable here to employ a Minute or two of <HI>Remarks</HI> upon it. I would not have taken so much Notice of this Matter, if I had not really thought the Cause of PIETY in the Countrey considerably concerned in it.</P>
<P>The Glorious GOD in <HI>Strange Ways,</HI> even <HI>fram∣ing Evil, and devising</HI> one <HI>Device</HI> after another <HI>against</HI> us, obliges the Countrey to <HI>Vast Expences,</HI> which amount unto much more than as much a∣gain as a <HI>Liberal Maintainance of the Ministry</HI> thro'∣out the Land would call for; And if we were so <HI>Wife,</HI> as to <HI>observe these Things,</HI> and would <HI>wise∣ly consider of His Doings,</HI> and <HI>consider our ways,</HI> we should Think, Whether a <HI>Righteous GOD</HI> be not
<PB N="111" REF="002905_0116_0FE646B900BAD420"/>in these Things punishing us for <HI>Witholding more than is meet,</HI> in this notorious Article.</P>
<P>But while the Countrey is under the <HI>Scourges</HI> of GOD, I will <HI>Read</HI> something of the <HI>Law</HI> unto you; and set <HI>Cmscience</HI> to work with and on such <HI>Questions</HI> as these.</P>
<P>Q. I. If you Read the <HI>First</HI> Epistle to the <HI>Corin∣thians,</HI> the <HI>Ninth</HI> Chapter, from the <HI>Fourth</HI> Verse to the <HI>Fourteenth,</HI> don't you find an Inspired Apo∣stle of our Lord, with six or seven Unanswerable Arguments, proving This, which he makes the Conclusion of all: <HI>The Lord hath Ordained, that they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel?</HI> And is it not then incontestibly Evident, That if you do not your part, that your <HI>Ministers</HI> may <HI>live</HI> well, and have a <HI>Food convenient</HI> for them, you Sin against the <HI>Ordinance</HI> of that Glorious LORD, whose Name you have been <HI>Baptised</HI> into?</P>
<P>Q. II While you do not <HI>Communicate</HI> what may be Needful for the Support of your <HI>Teachers,</HI> how can you stand before that plain Command of GOD your SAVIOUR; Gal. VI. 6. <HI>Let him that is taught in the Word, Communicate unto him who teacheth, in all good Things?</HI> Or, will <HI>GOD be mock∣ed,</HI> when you plead, <HI>That you can't afford the ex∣pences herein called</HI> for, when GOD knows, you ex∣pend much more in less useful ways, which might much better be spared?</P>
<P>Q. III. When our Lord <HI>sent forth</HI> His <HI>Ministers,</HI> did not He direct them to expect a <HI>Maintainance</HI> from them to whom He sent them; Declaring, Matth. X. 10. <HI>The Workman is worthy of his Meat:</HI> And, Luk. X. 7. <HI>The Labourer is worthy of his Wa∣ges?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="002905_0117_0FE646B90F1DDF80"/>
Q. IV. What an ample Provision of <HI>Temporal-Enjoyments,</HI> did the <HI>Holy One of Israel</HI> make, under the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Paedagogy, for the Tribe that were set apart for <HI>Spiritual Services;</HI> therewithal saying, Mal. III. 9, 10. <HI>Ye are cursed with a Curse, for ye have robbed me: Let there be Meat in my House, and prove me now herewith, if I do not pour you out a Blessing?</HI> And, if <HI>Moses</HI> took so much care for <HI>his Ministers,</HI> can you <HI>dream,</HI> that our Blessed JESUS, the <HI>Son over His House,</HI> takes no care for His?</P>
<P>Yea, Tho' your Ministers have a <HI>Ten times bet∣ter Office</HI> than the <HI>Ancient Levites,</HI> yet would they not in much less than a <HI>Quarter part</HI> of what was allow'd unto the <HI>Levites,</HI> reckon a very <HI>competent Allowance</HI> made unto them?</P>
<P>Q. V. Did not our Father <HI>Abraham</HI> owe and pay a <HI>Tenth</HI> unto <HI>Melchizedek?</HI> And is not our Glorious CHRIST an <HI>High-Priest,</HI> who has the Rights of <HI>Melchizedek</HI> belonging to Him? How will ye prove your selves the Genuine Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> if you devote not a <HI>Tenth part</HI> of your Income to the true <HI>Melchizedek?</HI> And will not less than <HI>One Half</HI> of this <HI>Tenth,</HI> ordinarily be much more than your <HI>Ministers</HI> would be comfor∣tably supply'd and content withal?</P>
<P>Q. VI. Can it be Reasonable, that your <HI>Mini∣sters</HI> Labourously spend all their <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> in doing the <HI>Best Good</HI> that can be done for you and yours; and neglect <HI>Advantages</HI> to Enrich themselves in the ways of other Business; And that you should at the same time expose them to <HI>Straits,</HI> and <HI>Wants,</HI> and let the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk under dis∣tressing <HI>Difficulties,</HI> and the various <HI>Temptations</HI> which a pinching <HI>Poverty</HI> must lay them open to?</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="002905_0118_0FE69283C2930308"/>
Q. VII. When a Laborious Minister of our Lord, received the Money which a Good Spirited People gathered for him, did he not assure them; Phil. IV. 18 <HI>It was a Sacrifice, acceptable, well-plea∣sing to GOD?</HI> Upon an Impartial Observation, may it not be found, that those Persons, and those Places, which <HI>do Best</HI> for the <HI>Maintainance</HI> of the <HI>Evangelical Ministry</HI> among them, <HI>Thrive most,</HI> un∣der a very sensible Benediction of GOD? If there could be Collected into an <HI>History</HI> the Nota∣bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Experiences, which here and there <HI>Particular Christians</HI> have had, of GOD smiling on their Af∣fairs, with a Conspicuous and Surprising <HI>Blessing,</HI> from the time that they have set themselves to en∣courage his Meritorious <HI>Ministers,</HI> would not the astonishing <HI>History</HI> be enough to convince an <HI>A∣theist,</HI> and bring a <HI>Churl</HI> to be <HI>Bountiful?</HI></P>
<P>Seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>UESTIONS,—If duely Thought upon, certainly our <HI>Levites</HI> would have their <HI>Por∣tion</HI> more duly <HI>given</HI> to them!</P>
<P>In thus <HI>Contending</HI> for them, I will take occasi∣on for a <HI>Parenthesis</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew Husbandry.</HI></P>
<P>[It was forbidden Deut. XXV. 4. To <HI>Muzzle an Ox treading out the Corn.</HI> They (as well as other Nations) used <HI>Oxen</HI> in <HI>treading out their Corn,</HI> ei∣their with their <HI>Feet</HI> barely, or their <HI>Feet</HI> shod with <HI>Brass</HI> or <HI>Iron,</HI> or with drawing over the Corn, an <HI>Heavy Cart,</HI> or Wooden Sled, with Iron Teeth or Nails next the Ground. While the <HI>Oxen</HI> were at this Work, they sometimes <HI>muzzled</HI> them, or daubed their Mouths, with Dung, or put <HI>Sharps</HI> into their Mouths, or hung an Instrument about their Necks that hindred them from stouping, or kept them from any <HI>Drink,</HI> or covered the <HI>Corn</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="002905_0119_0FE691F4B11811C8"/>with Skins. These things are prohibited. The Intention of the Prohibition, is, That we should make much, even of the <HI>Brute Creatures</HI> that serve us. But it intends also, That we must learn to be <HI>Kind</HI> as well as <HI>Just</HI> unto all that are employ'd for our Good. Now this Law is <HI>Twice</HI> quoted in New Testament; and it is both Times for this purpose, To shew, that it is the <HI>Duty</HI> of a People, to give their Ministers a <HI>Comfortable Maintainance.</HI>]</P>
<P>I hope, I have said enough. I may now go on to say,</P>
<P>Secondly. When the <HI>Clouds</HI> distil <HI>Rains,</HI> the <HI>Fruits</HI> ought to be answerable. Shall I tell you, who the People are, that are in hazard of having the <HI>Clouds commanded,</HI> that they should convey no <HI>Rains</HI> unto them? Tis the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> that brings forth no <HI>Fruits,</HI> but <HI>Sowre Grapss.</HI> The <HI>Sowre Grapes</HI> of <HI>Ungodliness</HI> and <HI>Unrighteousness,</HI> abounding a∣mong a People that have the Gospel, these pro∣cure the Salutiferous <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Rains</HI> to be with∣held from them. We are so warned of GOD; Heb. VI. 7, 8. <HI>The Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, and bears Thorns and Briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</HI> People hear the Word of GOD from time to time; and they get no Good by it; They are nothing the better for what they hear; The Word is not Embraced, not Obeyed, not Complied withal. If People won't <HI>Hearken</HI> to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, they shall not have the <HI>Hearing</HI> of it. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is preached among a a People; But, Few <HI>Sinners</HI> are <HI>Converted from the Error of their ways.</HI> And, if any are Converted, they show but very <HI>Dull Marks</HI> of their Conversi∣on;
<PB N="115" REF="002905_0120_0FE691FC1BCA0380"/>they continue Barren and Lifeless Christians; there is little <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> among them; they make little Improvement in <HI>Piety.</HI> Alas, What will this <HI>Unfruitfulness</HI> bring them to? As our Lord said unto His Apostle; Act. XXII. 18. <HI>Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy Testimony concerning me.</HI> Thus does the Great GOD now say to the <HI>Clouds,</HI> which distil His <HI>Rains</HI> with so little profit upon the Peo∣ple; <HI>Make haste, and come away from a People that hates to be Reformed. O my Word, Thou shalt stay no longer, where they will not receive thy Testimony.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven distilling Evangelical <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, we should not be satisfied without the <HI>Heavenly Influences</HI> coming with and in the <HI>Rains</HI> upon our Souls. It is one of the <HI>Precious Promises;</HI> Isa. LV. 10, 11. <HI>As the Rain cometh down from Heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth,—so shall my Word be, that goeth forth out of my Mouth.</HI> Oh! that we may feel <HI>this Word</HI> fulfilled unto us! Our Gospellized People; The <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven have long been showring down the <HI>Rains</HI> of the Gospel upon you. But, Oh! What the <HI>Influences</HI> of the <HI>Glorious Gospel!</HI> What the <HI>Dispositions</HI> which it has brought you to!</P>
<P>I will describe to you, a Soul that feels the <HI>In∣fluences</HI> of the <HI>Heavenly Showers</HI> upon it. Examine what <HI>Experiences</HI> you have had of such <HI>Influences.</HI></P>
<P>Tis a Soul <HI>happily Rained</HI> upon, that is come heartily to say; <HI>Great GOD, Thou shalt be my GOD and my Portion, and if I may live unto thee, I have all my Desire!</HI> Heartily to say; <HI>O my Lovely SAVI∣OUR,
<PB N="116" REF="002905_0121_0FE691FC3723B130"/>I Repair to thee, and Rely on thee, that thou mayst bring me to GOD, and save me to the uttermost!</HI> Heartily to say, <HI>Vile Sin, I will for ever hate thee, and shun thee, and seek the Death of thee, and be glad of every thing that helps to kill thee!</HI> Heartily to say, <HI>Vain World, I will expect nothing from thee; and I will not be uneasy, tho' thy Pleasures and Riches and Honours be denied unto me!</HI> Heartily to say, <HI>I wish well un∣to every one; Oh! that I may do Good unto all: Fain would I he a Blessing in all Relations!</HI> Are these the Dispositions of thy Soul? O Soul, on which the <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven have distilled the <HI>Showers of Bles∣sing,</HI> To thee there belongs that Word; Isa. LVIII. 11. <HI>The Lord shall satisfy thy Soul in Drought; and thou shalt be like a watered Garden.</HI></P>
<P>But the EXHORTATION, shall at length come to us, in that Abridgment which <HI>Hosea,</HI> that long lived Minister has given us, not only by his own Sermons, for about fourscore Years toge∣ther, but also of all the Sermons preached by all the Prophets that were sent unto the Ancient People of GOD. You thus have it, Hos. X. 12. <HI>Tis time to seek the Lord, until He come and Rain Righteousness upon you.</HI> Behold what now falls from the opened <HI>Bottles of Heaven</HI> upon you.</P>
<P>O you that have the <HI>Clouds</HI> of Heaven over you; Be assured of this; Your Great SAVIOUR will come with a Blessed <HI>Rain of Righteousness,</HI> upon them that <HI>Seasonably seek</HI> for such a Blessed∣ness.</P>
<P>The Thing to be <HI>sought</HI> for, is; That we may, by the <HI>Faith</HI> of it, come to have the perfect and peerless <HI>Righteousness</HI> of what our SAVIOUR did in conformity to the <HI>Law</HI> which is the <HI>Rule</HI> of
<PB N="117" REF="002905_0122_0FE691FDA32CA768"/><HI>Righteousness,</HI> as our <HI>Surety,</HI> may be imputed un∣to us for the <HI>Justification of Life:</HI> And then, that our SAVIOUR would <HI>Sanctify</HI> us, as well as <HI>Justi∣fy</HI> us, and <HI>lead us in the Paths of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>We are now to apprehend, That when our SAVIOUR communicates of Himself and His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> in His <HI>Word,</HI> unto our Souls, there is in the <HI>Word</HI> it self, a sweet <HI>Rain</HI> from Heaven falling upon us. We shall soon make the Simili∣tude very apparent. For, Does the <HI>Rain</HI> make the Earth <HI>Fruitful?</HI> O our Gospellized People, We hope, we hope, you can say, That you find the <HI>Word</HI> of your SAVIOUR do so. The <HI>Rain,</HI> Does it <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Refresh</HI> the Earth? Doubtless, many of you can bring in this Testimony for the <HI>Word</HI> of your SAVIOUR, <HI>Lord, By this thou hast Quickened me!</HI> But then, The <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which our SAVIOUR has to bestow upon them, who attend upon His <HI>Word</HI> for it, This also may be compared unto the <HI>Rain,</HI> and the Comparison is a very Apt one. Shall we say? None but GOD can give the <HI>Rain.</HI> We are so taught of GOD; Jer. XIV. 22. <HI>Can the Heavens give Showers? Art not thou He, O Lord our GOD? Therefore we will wait upon thee, for thou hast made all these things.</HI> All <HI>Other Causes</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Rain,</HI> are but <HI>Second Causes.</HI> This is very sure; None but GOD can give <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> unto us. Tis, <HI>The Righteousness of GOD.</HI> If our SAVIOUR had not been GOD as well as Man, He could never have <HI>brought in</HI> for us, that <HI>Everlasting Righteousness,</HI> wherein we may appear before GOD. And none but an Almighty GOD could ever do for us, those Things, which are done when <HI>Righteousness</HI> is convey'd unto us. Tru∣ly,
<PB N="118" REF="002905_0123_0FE691FDC41228F8"/>'tis a Constellation of <HI>Miracles!</HI> When a <HI>Sinner</HI> is made <HI>Righteous,</HI> the <HI>Blind</HI> sees, the <HI>Lame</HI> walks, the <HI>Dead</HI> comes to Life; <HI>Stone</HI> is turn'd into <HI>Flesh;</HI> a <HI>Wolf</HI> is chang'd into a <HI>Lamb.</HI> The Holy SPIRIT, who does these things,— <HI>O Lord, Thou art Great, and thou doest wondrous Things, and thou art GOD a∣lone.</HI> Again; The <HI>Necessity</HI> of the <HI>Rain;</HI> How feelingly is This confessed with us? A <HI>Drought</HI> soon brings us to those Ejulations; Joel I. 19, 20. <HI>O Lord,— The Fire hath devoured the Pastures of the Wilderness, and the Flame has burnt all the Trees of the Field: The Beasts of the Field cry also unto thee.</HI> But then, the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>Righteousness</HI> is nothing short of That. Soul, <HI>Necessity</HI> is laid upon thee, to ob∣tain the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of thy SAVIOUR, and <HI>wo unto thee if thou do it not.</HI> There is a <HI>Fire</HI> that will <HI>devour</HI> thee, and a <HI>Flame</HI> that will <HI>burn</HI> thee up, if thou be a Stranger to it. Once more; The <HI>Ex∣cellency</HI> of the <HI>Rain;</HI> Who once ever disputed this? 'Tis elegantly descanted on; Psal. LXV. 9, 10, 11. <HI>Thou visitest the Earth, and waterest it; thou greatly enrichest it with the River of GOD, which is full of Water;— Thou makest it soft with Showers; Thou crownest the Year with thy Goodness, and thy Pathes drop Fatness.</HI> But the <HI>Excellency</HI> of <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> is yet more to be accounted of. Soul, Pos∣sessing the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of thy SAVIOUR, thou hast what makes thee <HI>more Excellent than thy Neigh∣bour.</HI> GOD visits thee; thou art <HI>greatly Enriched with the River of GOD.</HI> He <HI>Crowns</HI> thee with His <HI>Goodness,</HI> and His <HI>Pathes drop Fatness</HI> upon thee.</P>
<P>In fine; What remains is This. O you that <HI>follow after Righteousness.</HI> PRAYER, PRAYER, to GOD your SAVIOUR for it; This is the
<PB N="119" REF="002905_0124_0FE6920437092C20"/>Grand Method of your <HI>seeking</HI> for a <HI>Rain of Righ∣teousness.</HI> The Cry of a perishing Sinner, and a Soul gasping like the parched Earth;— <HI>O my GOD and my SAVIOUR, Let thy Righteousness be Rained upon me from above!</HI>— May that Cry go up this Day from every one of us all; and pierce the <HI>Clouds,</HI> reach the <HI>Heavens!</HI> No one ever <HI>comes into the Righteousness of GOD,</HI> but here is the First of his Motions towards it, <HI>Behold, He prays.</HI> Of the genuine Christian we read, Psal. XXIV. 5, 6. <HI>He shall receive Righteousness from the GOD of hu Salvation; This is the Generation of them that seek Him.</HI> Christian, When thy SAVIOUR is going to make thee <HI>Righteous,</HI> He will bring thee into the <HI>Generation of them that seek Him.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, but Remember, This is to be done in the <HI>Proper Time</HI> for it; even, when, <HI>It is Time to seek the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, Every Day we are to take our <HI>Time</HI> for <HI>the seeking</HI> of GOD. <HI>Every Day</HI> 'tis to be done in fit <HI>Retrements; Every Day</HI> 'tis to be done with our <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mesticks.</HI> A <HI>Black Day</HI> 'tis, wherein GOD has not been sought unto. But then, The <HI>Lords-day;</HI> This, be sure, is a most <HI>proper Time</HI> for this Work. 'Tis the <HI>Day of Rain.</HI> The <HI>Clouds</HI> which drop down <HI>Righteousness,</HI> are on that Day hovering o∣ver the <HI>Assemblies of Zion.</HI> Tis <HI>Now,</HI> that the SPIRIT of GOD sollicits us;
<Q>Take This <HI>Time,</HI> O Soul <HI>far from Righteousness.</HI> Be not <HI>Stout-heart∣ed.</HI> Fall down before thy SAVIOUR. Humbly look to Him, and beg of Him; for a <HI>Rain of Righ∣teousness</HI> upon thee.</Q> Verily, Millions of Souls, have on This Day, found a <HI>Rain of Righteousness</HI> on them, from a SAVIOUR <HI>sought</HI> unto!</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="002905_0125_0FE692045872F110"/>
There is yet one thing more to be said. The <HI>present Time</HI> is of all the most <HI>proper Time.</HI> We must be so perswaded; 2 Cor. VI. 2. <HI>Behold, Now is the Acceptable Time.</HI> Languishing Soul, Thy SAVI∣OUR stands ready with His <HI>Righteousness.</HI> He makes a Tender of His <HI>Righteousness.</HI> He says, <HI>Ask and it shall be given thee.</HI> Thou hast no Assurance of any but the <HI>present Time,</HI> to accept the Tender: 'Tis thy <HI>only Time.</HI> Alas, What Multitudes fall short of <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> because they let slip their <HI>only Time.</HI> Losing the <HI>present Time,</HI> they lose <HI>all their Time,</HI> and lose their Souls. They would not seasonably <HI>Worship the King, the Lord of Hosts;</HI> Even <HI>upon them there shall be no Rain; This shall be their Punishment, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI></P>
<P>Was it possible for me to say this, without an∣nexing a most solemn Admonition unto our <HI>Young People?</HI> Children, Be you admonished of This. The <HI>Time of Youth,</HI> is the most <HI>proper Time</HI> in the World, for you to seek unto your SAVIOUR, for a <HI>Rain</HI> of His <HI>Righteousness</HI> upon you. You will never see such another Time. You Read, [For, I hope, you every Day Read in the Book, which tells you of him, even, the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> which are <HI>able to make Children wise unto Salvation!</HI>] of one, of whom it is related, <HI>While he was yet Young, he began to seek after GOD.</HI> GOD brought that <HI>Young Man</HI> into His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and made him one of the <HI>Best Men</HI> in the World. I advise you to think on those two Passages, in the <HI>Holy Scrip∣tures.</HI> First, a pious Father laid that Charge up∣on a Son; 1 Chron. XXVIII. 9. <HI>My Son, serve the GOD of thy Father; If thou seek Him, He will be found of thee.</HI> The Devout Son kept in his Mind
<PB N="121" REF="002905_0126_0FE692064C0E1328"/>that Charge of his Father. Anon, with an Eye to it, he wrote that strain of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> Prov. VIII. 17 <HI>They that seek me early, shall find me.</HI></P>
<P>My Son, Mind the Charge GOD now laid up∣on thee.</P>
<P>¶ But we will now take into our consideration, the <HI>Terrible Judgment</HI> in the <HI>Literal sense</HI> of it. And what is now to be observed, is; That when the Glorious GOD <HI>commands</HI> the <HI>Natural Clouds</HI> to <HI>Distil no Rains</HI> upon a Land, His Judgment upon the Land should have a serious Notice taken of it.</P>
<P>It is what these <HI>Remarks</HI> are to be made upon.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Clouds</HI> are <HI>Created</HI> by GOD, and when they distil <HI>Rains,</HI> 'tis because they are <HI>commanded</HI> by Him to do it. The <HI>Philosophy</HI> of the <HI>Clouds</HI> and their distilled <HI>Rains,</HI> is not here to be enlarged up∣on. Tis enough to say, The <HI>Philosopher</HI> will tell you, That a <HI>Cloud</HI> is a Collection of little, but concave, <HI>Globules,</HI> which therefore ascend unto that Heighth, wherein they are of <HI>equal Weight</HI> with the <HI>Air;</HI> where they remain suspended, un∣til by a Motion in the <HI>Air,</HI> they are Broken, and so come down in drops, that make our <HI>Mists</HI> or <HI>Showers.</HI> But it is the <HI>Religion</HI> of these <HI>Watry Me∣teors,</HI> with which we are now to be entertained. <HI>Reason</HI> tells us, That there is a GOD of Infinite <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> who is the <HI>Creator</HI> of the World. These parts of the World then must needs be the <HI>Creatures</HI> of that Glorious GOD. But let us hear what <HI>Scripture</HI> teaches us concern∣ing it.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="002905_0127_0FE6920667CE8570"/>
The <HI>Book</HI> of GOD and of <HI>Truth,</HI> has taught us, That the <HI>Clouds</HI> are the <HI>Creatures</HI> of GOD. So we read; Joh. XXVI. 8. <HI>He bindeth up the Waters in His Thick Clouds, and the Cloud is not rent under them.</HI> So we read; Job XXXVII. 15. <HI>GOD causes the Light of His Cloud to shine.</HI> The <HI>Clouds</HI> are there∣fore called, The <HI>Chariots</HI> of GOD, and, The <HI>Chambers</HI> of GOD; and, The <HI>Treasures</HI> of GOD; and the <HI>Stories</HI> which are <HI>built</HI> by GOD. Of our GOD we read; Psal. CXLVII. 8. <HI>GOD covers the Heavens with Clouds; and prepareth Rain for the Earth.</HI> The Pagans called their <HI>Jupiter,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Nubicoga;</HI> He that <HI>Orders the Clouds.</HI> We challenge the Name for our JEHOVAH; Of whom we read, <HI>He commands the Clouds from A∣bove.</HI></P>
<P>And then, This Book of His, has taught us, That the <HI>Rains</HI> too are the <HI>Creatures</HI> of GOD. So we read; Job V. 10. <HI>GOD giveth Rain upon the Earth, and sendeth Waters upon the Field.</HI> So we read; Job XXXVI. 27, 28. <HI>GOD maketh small the drops of Water, they pour down Rain according to the Vapour thereof: Which the Clouds do drop, and distil upon Man abundantly.</HI> We are accordingly informed, That GOD is the <HI>Father of the Rain;</HI> and, That GOD <HI>makes a Decree for the Rain.</HI> When the <HI>Rain</HI> falls, there cometh to pass that thing; Psal. LXV. 9, 10. Lord, <HI>Thou visitest the Earth, and waterest it; Thou waterest the Ridges thereof abundantly, Thou settlest the Furrows thereef: Thou makest it soft with Show∣ers.</HI> We forget the <HI>Original</HI> of the <HI>Rain,</HI> if we don't look above the Region, from which it falls upon us; and if we are Strangers to those Terms; <HI>Lord, It is Thou that causest the Rain to fall upon thy
<PB N="123" REF="002905_0128_0FE6920C9607A218"/>Land.</HI> We ought then <HI>Religiously</HI> to acknowledge the <HI>Providence</HI> of the Glorious GOD, in His dis∣posing of the <HI>Clouds</HI> and of the <HI>Rains.</HI> Behold the Distribution of the <HI>Clouds</HI> and of the <HI>Rains,</HI> in such agreeable <HI>Proportions,</HI> as to answer the <HI>Neces∣sities</HI> of the World, and say, <HI>What a sensible Pro∣vidence of the Glorious GOD!</HI> Man, Dost thou know the <HI>Ballancings of the Clouds?</HI> They are the <HI>Won∣drous Works</HI> of a GOD who is <HI>perfect in Knowledge.</HI> Behold the <HI>gentle</HI> and <HI>softly</HI> way, in which the <HI>Clouds</HI> do drop down the <HI>Rains;</HI> not in <HI>destructive Torrents!</HI> And again say, <HI>What a sensible Providence of a Glorious GOD!</HI> It is our GOD who does <HI>make small the drops of Water, and pours down Rain accor∣ding to the Vapour thereof.</HI> He that owns not the Hand of GOD in the <HI>Clouds</HI> and the <HI>Rains,</HI> de∣serves to be struck with something else, that the <HI>Clouds</HI> are sometimes charged withal; deserves to see the <HI>Clouds</HI> darting down upon him their <HI>Thun∣derbolts!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. When GOD <HI>commands</HI> the <HI>Clouds,</HI> to distil no <HI>Rains,</HI> it is a <HI>Judgment,</HI> that Men should be affected withal. A long want of <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Rains,</HI> or, the promising Appearance of <HI>Clouds</HI> from time to time going over without <HI>Rain;</HI> This is a very affecting <HI>Judgment</HI> of Heaven upon a sinful World. A DROUGHT is a sore <HI>Judgment</HI> of GOD!</P>
<P>It is a <HI>Judgment</HI> that is often threatned among the Effects of the Divine Displeasure: A <HI>Judgment</HI> of great Note among the Threatnings of GOD. Thus you read, Lev. XXVI. 19. <HI>I will punish you, and I will make your Heavens as Iron, and your Earth at Brass.</HI> Thus you read; Deut. XI. 17. <HI>The Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="124" REF="002905_0129_0FE692852E06C2B8"/>Wrath kindled against you, and He shut up the Heaven that there be no Rain.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, a <HI>Drought</HI> is a Plague, wherein a check is given to the <HI>Ordinary Course of Nature.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Hand</HI> of GOD that gives the Check; the Hand of an angry GOD. The <HI>Burning Anger</HI> of GOD is discovered in it. The <HI>Lord GOD calls to contend by Fire,</HI> in the <HI>Judgment.</HI> There is the <HI>Indignation of GOD,</HI> proclaim'd against a Land, when the <HI>Land</HI> is <HI>not Rain'd upon.</HI> The Great GOD was offended; And then came this <HI>Judgment;</HI> Hag. I. 11. <HI>I called for a Drought upon the Land, and upon that which the Ground bringeth forth, and upon Men, and upon Cattel.</HI></P>
<P>But that in which a <HI>Drought</HI> proves a fearful Plague, is, The <HI>Consequence</HI> of it. A <HI>Scarcity</HI> fol∣lows: Yea, the <HI>Famine;</HI> Than which, what is there more to be trembled at? Perhaps <HI>Drink</HI> for Man and Beast, may grow scarce, by a <HI>Drought</HI> going on to Extremity. Be sure, <HI>Food</HI> will do so. Thus we read; Jer. XIV. 3, 4. <HI>Their Nobles have sent their little ones to the Waters, they came to the Pits, they found no Water; they returned with their Vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded; and cover∣ed their Heads: Because the Ground is chapt, for there was no Rain in the Earth, the Plowmen were ashamed.</HI> Thus we read; Amos IV. 7, 8. <HI>I have witholden the Rain from you, when there were yet three months to the Harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one City, and I caused it not to rain upon another City: One piece was rained upon; and the piece whereupon it rained not, withered.— So two or three Cities wandred unto one City to drink Water; but they were not satisfied.</HI> The <HI>Vegetable World</HI> cannot subsist, except the <HI>Showers</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="002905_0130_0FE692854DDED7A0"/>of Heaven saturate it. The <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven are needful, as a moist Vehicle, to carry along with them that <HI>Nourishment</HI> which the <HI>Plants</HI> do subsist upon. All <HI>Plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> must languish and wither, if they have not these <HI>Waters</HI> to bring into them the <HI>Sap,</HI> which they owe their Growth unto. But, if the <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>getables</HI> of the World be destroy'd, the <HI>Animals</HI> will soon be so too. The <HI>Fruits</HI> of the Earth, depend on the <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven. All <HI>Ani∣mals</HI> do live on the <HI>Fruits</HI> of the Earth, or on those <HI>Animals</HI> which do live on these <HI>Fruits.</HI> We read; Job XXXVIII 26, 27. He <HI>causes it to rain on the Earth,—to satisfy the desolate and waste Ground, and to cause the Bud of the tend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b to spring forth.</HI> Hence, when a <HI>Drought</HI> is parching our Fields, there is this awful Voice of GOD unto us in it; <HI>I will not feed you saith the Lord!</HI> But, the <HI>Famine!</HI> A <HI>Judgment</HI> which all Faces may <HI>gather Paleness</HI> at the very Mention of! To die of the <HI>Famine:</HI> How <HI>Grievous</HI> a <HI>Death!</HI> I will show you how it looks; Lam. V. 10 <HI>Our Skin was black like an Oven, be∣cause of the terrible F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>!</HI></P>
<P>But let us make a sew brief <HI>Inferences,</HI> from what has been thus Remark'd unto us.</P>
<P>First. When the <HI>Clouds</HI> do distil <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, our <HI>Thankful Praises</HI> to the Glorious GOD are called for. My Brethren, Let our <HI>Praises</HI> go up in a greater Plenty than any <HI>Vapours,</HI> to the <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> who now opens and empties the <HI>Bot∣tles of Heaven</HI> upon us. We read; Act XIV. 17. <HI>He left not Himself without a Witness, in that He did us Good, and gave us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seasons filling our Hearts with Food and Gladness.</HI> The <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven then bespeak from us
<PB N="126" REF="002905_0131_0FE6920CB0CC4388"/>these Thankful Confessions; <HI>Great GOD; Thou art a good GOD! Oh! How much ought we to love and serve the GOD, who does good unto us, in giving us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seasons!</HI> Verily, The <HI>Showers</HI> are worse thrown away, than those that fall upon the <HI>Rocks,</HI> if they produce not such Consequences from us.</P>
<P>But, Secondly. When the <HI>Clouds</HI> refuse to dis∣til <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, the Glorious GOD requires the Dispositions of <HI>Repentance</HI> from us. It is GOD who <HI>commands the Clouds</HI> to distil no <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, when we undergo such a Calamity. It be∣comes us now, with <HI>Repenting Minds,</HI> humbly to enquire, <HI>what Controversy the Holy One may have with us, in such a Calamity?</HI> And, <HI>what Iniquity it may be, that such a Punishment is inflicted for?</HI> 'Tis true; No People under the <HI>New Testament</HI> are under such a <HI>Covenant</HI> for <HI>External Prosperity,</HI> upon Obe∣dience to the Laws of GOD, as the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Na∣tion were, under the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Dispensation. The Blessed GOD has not promised unto any People now, That if they will not scandalously <HI>Break His Covenant,</HI> they shall see no <HI>Unfruitful Seasons.</HI> Peo∣ple may have the <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven, and other such Blessings denied unto them, and be <HI>brought low thro' Oppression Affliction and Sorrow;</HI> And yet be able to say, <HI>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy Covenant.</HI> We see it, at this very Day. The Peo∣ple that have least of all paid <HI>respect unto the Cove∣nant</HI> of GOD, yet have not the fewest <HI>Showers</HI> of Heaven upon them. Nevertheless, when <HI>Showers</HI> are witheld, it is <HI>frequently,</HI> it is <HI>commonly,</HI> a <HI>Pu∣nishment</HI> upon a <HI>Land,</HI> for having <HI>sinned grievously</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="002905_0132_0FE6920E32BF8808"/>when <HI>Water-springs are turned into Dry-ground,</HI> and <HI>a Fruitful Land into Barrenness,</HI> it is usually, for <HI>the Wickedness of those that dwell therein.</HI> 'Tis, as we read; Deut. XXVIII. 15, 23, 24. <HI>If thou wilt not hearken unto the Voice of the Lord thy GOD, Thy Hea∣ven that is over thy head shall be Brass, and the Earth that is under thee shall be Iron; The Lord shall make the Rain of thy Land Powder and Dust.</HI> Wherefore, under such <HI>Fiery Rebukes</HI> of our GOD, we should Loathe and Judge our selves for our <HI>Miscarriages.</HI> Of these, there is especially <HI>One,</HI> that is a very <HI>Comprehensive One;</HI> That is to say, Our <HI>Unfruitful∣ness,</HI> our <HI>Unfruitfulness!</HI> How <HI>Pertinently,</HI> but how <HI>Penitently,</HI> may this <HI>Reflection</HI> be made on this Oc∣casion! <HI>Lord, We bring forth little good Fruit of the Cultivations which thou dost employ upon us. How fitly, how justly, how wisely, are an Unfruitful People pu∣nished with Unfruitful Seasons!</HI> Methinks, I over∣hear the <HI>Angel of the Waters</HI> making his Acclama∣tions; <HI>Thou art Righteous, O Lord, because thou hast judged so!</HI> It becomes us to <HI>find out</HI> our <HI>Miscarria∣ges;</HI> to <HI>Bewail</HI> them, to <HI>Reform</HI> them; and Re∣pair unto the great <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of our SAVIOUR for the Pardon of them. Syrs, Our <HI>Main Work</HI> at such a time, is, To seek <HI>Reconciliation</HI> with GOD. Oh! For Good Terms with the Great KING, from whose Countrey it is, that <HI>our Countrey is nourished!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. When we would have the <HI>Clouds</HI> to distil <HI>Rains</HI> upon us, what shall we do, what can we do, but look up to the Glorious GOD for the <HI>supply</HI> of what is wanting unto us? Both the <HI>Former Rain</HI> and the <HI>Latter Rain</HI> is that for which our Glorious GOD is to be look'd unto: The
<PB N="128" REF="002905_0133_0FE6920E572308E0"/><HI>Former Rain,</HI> to soften the Ground before the <HI>Sow∣ing</HI> of the <HI>Seed;</HI> The <HI>Matter Rain,</HI> by which the Corn in the Blade is brought on to <HI>Earing</HI> and <HI>Harvest.</HI> We have a Promise to plead for it, Isa. XXX. 23. <HI>He shall give the Rain of</HI> [or, for] <HI>thy Seed, that thou shalt sow the Ground withal, and Bread of the Increase of the Earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous.</HI> Our GOD can <HI>command the Clouds,</HI> to distil what <HI>Rains</HI> He pleases upon us. Our Main concern is with a GOD, who <HI>commands Delive∣rances.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Direction which our GOD has gi∣ven us; Zech. X. 1. <HI>Ask ye of the Lord Rain in the time of the latter Rain; so the Lord shall make bright Clouds, and give them Showers of Rain, to every one Grass in the Field.</HI> And in pursuance of this Di∣rection, there is a Notable Thing, which I am to mind you of. In the <HI>Covenant</HI> which our Graci∣ous GOD, after the Flood, made with our Patri∣arch <HI>Noah,</HI> who was <HI>to Comfort us concerning our Toil, and the Work of our Hands, because of the Ground which the Lord had cursed;</HI> there is a Promise of <HI>Regular Seasons,</HI> [Perhaps better than what were before the <HI>Flood;</HI>] wherein <HI>Seasonable Rains</HI> are comprehended. It may be partly with relation to that <HI>Covenant,</HI> that we read; Psal. XXXVI. 5. <HI>Thy Mercy, O Lord, is in the Heavens; they Faithful∣ness reacheth to the CLOUDS.</HI> When we want <HI>Rain,</HI> we should do well in our Supplications to plead that COVENANT of our GOD. It may be, if it were more in Use with us, to plead that CO∣VENANT, the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of our GOD, would bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the CLOUDS more display'd before us. My Friends, Our Invitations and our Excitations, to
<PB N="129" REF="002905_0134_0FE69213FA4F0080"/>our <HI>Supplications,</HI> are Numberless. Among these, we have what is very cogent and pungent, when it pleases the Holy One, to send a severe <HI>Drought</HI> upon us. How Wicked, and how Woful, are the <HI>Prayerless,</HI> at such a Time, when <HI>our GOD</HI> exhi∣bits Himself as a <HI>Consuming Fire</HI> unto us! <HI>O Prayer∣less ones,</HI> what a Share have you in procuring the Desolation, whibh we are in danger of, while you will do nothing for the preventing of it? Our Business at such a Time, is, To <HI>look above the Clouds,</HI> unto a Merciful GOD, who <HI>Numbers the Clouds in Wisdom,</HI> and who can <HI>stay the Bottles of Heaven.</HI> Of this GOD, we are told; He is One, whose <HI>Faithfulness reacheth to the Clouds.</HI> It may be, a GOD of such <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> will deal with us, according to the <HI>Word on which he has caused us to hope;</HI> Even, that Word; <HI>If I shut up Heaven, that there be no Rain, and my People humble themselves, and pray and seek my Face, and turn from their wicked Ways, Then will I hear from Heaven, and heal their Land.</HI> We must come this Day to that Resolution; Jer. XIV. 22. <HI>Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles, that can cause Rain? Or can the Heavens give Showers? Art not thou He, O Lord our GOD? Therefore we will wait upon thee: For thou hast made all these things.</HI> It was demanded of old, <HI>Canst thou lift up thy Voice to the Clouds, that abundance of Waters may cover thee?</HI> No; Let us <HI>Lift up our Voice</HI> to the GOD, who <HI>commands</HI> the <HI>Clouds.</HI> 'Tis He alone who can <HI>send abundance of Waters</HI> from thence upon us. He will not so <HI>hide Himself in a Cloud,</HI> that our <HI>Prayer shall not pass through</HI> it, and come unto Him.</P>
<P>I have done, The <HI>Sermon</HI> of this Day, comes to you as one of the <HI>Clouds,</HI> from whence the <HI>Rains</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="002905_0135_0FE692141990D490"/>of Heaven have been distilling upon you. But, <HI>Clouds distilling of Rains</HI> often bring <HI>Thunder</HI> with them. The <HI>Showers</HI> of this Day shall go off in <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightning.</HI> We shall conclude with a COROLLARY, that shall carry <HI>Lightning</HI> and <HI>Thunder</HI> in it.</P>
<P>Surely, The <HI>Wicked</HI> that shall be turned <HI>into Hell,</HI> and <HI>all they that forget GOD,</HI> must see very direful Circumstances. Miserable they, on whom GOD <HI>Commands the Clouds</HI> to distil no <HI>Rains.</HI> But, Oh! how miserable they, who go down to the <HI>Fires</HI> that <HI>Burn in the Foundations of the Mountains!</HI> My Neighbours, If any of you <HI>Dy in your Sins,</HI> you go to a place, where GOD <HI>Commands the Clouds</HI> to distil no <HI>Rains</HI> upon the Miserables. Alas, your Lot must be in such an horrid Land as That; Isa. XXXIV. 9, 10. <HI>The Streams thereof shall be turn∣ed into Pitch, and the Dust thereof into Brimstone, and the Land thereof shall become burning Pitch; It shall not be quenched Night nor Day, the Smoke thereof shall go up forever.</HI> In that place, GOD from His <HI>Clouds,</HI> being <HI>Terrible from his Holy places,</HI> only sends down <HI>Hail stones and Coals of Fire,</HI> and burning Thunder∣bolts. In that place, the <HI>Tormented</HI> in vain wish for a <HI>Drop of Water</HI> to cool their Anguish. There, the <HI>Wicked</HI> are made <HI>as a Fiery Oven,</HI> by the <HI>Hot Anger of GOD;</HI> And the <HI>Smoke of their Torment as∣cends forever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! Be <HI>perswaded,</HI> Immediately to get into the <HI>Peace of GOD;</HI> Immediately to <HI>flee from the Wrath to come;</HI> Immediately to lay hold on the JESUS, who <HI>delivers</HI> from it. Be <HI>perswaded, Knowing the Terror of the Lord!</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>

<P><HI>OF whom speaks the</HI> Psalmist <HI>This?</HI> Those whom the SPIRIT of GOD calls, <HI>Evil Doers,</HI> and, <HI>Workers of Iniquity,</HI> are more distinguishingly and immediately referr'd unto. But it is the <HI>Com∣mon Lot of Mankind,</HI> wherein such have their Share, that is thus described unto us. Even <HI>Good Livers, They also who do no Iniquity,</HI> have <HI>their</HI> Share in it. But it is mentioned on this Occasion. Be∣sides and beyond the more <HI>Private Interpretation</HI> of the <HI>Psalm,</HI> we are to apprehend the <HI>Song of Zion</HI> before us, as consisting of proper Instructions for the <HI>Holy People</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> who holds <HI>Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity</HI> to be a <HI>Mark</HI> of the <HI>True Church.</HI> We find here foretold the Ruin of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> in a

<P>All that we shall here consider, is, The <HI>Common Lot of Mankind;</HI> For This is but what <HI>Mankind</HI> in general is to look for.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE with which we are now to be <HI>Instructed,</HI> but Oh! that as much <HI>Affected!</HI>— is This.</P>

<PB N="135" REF="002905_0140_0FE6921CB6ACDF38"/>firmly <HI>rooted</HI> there.

LXXXIX. 48. <HI>What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is he that liveth, and shall not see Death?</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="002905_0141_0FE6928DE0E6BEA8"/>'Tis in the Quality of a <HI>Mower,</HI> with an I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resistible <HI>Sithe</HI> in his Hand, that the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> appears unto him. 'Tis he, who may truly challenge the Title of, <HI>The Catholic King.</HI> And as <HI>David</HI> once dealt with the <HI>Geshurites, He smote the Land, and left neither Man nor Woman alive;</HI> so does this <HI>Mower</HI> deal with all Mankind; He <HI>smites the Land;</HI> He carries his <HI>Mortal Sithe</HI> over the Face of it. He <HI>cuts down</HI> all before him, until not one spire of <HI>Grass</HI> is left standing in the Field. The <HI>Matter,</HI> and the <HI>Reason</HI> of the Matter, has by the Holy SPIRIT of GOD been thus declared unto us; Rom. V. 12. <HI>By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have sinned. Sin, Sin,</HI> put the <HI>Sithe</HI> in∣to the Hand of the <HI>Mower;</HI> and has given the <HI>Edge</HI> unto the <HI>Sithe:</HI> Hence, 'tis now come to pass, <HI>Death</HI> as one may say, like <HI>Caesar,</HI> taxes <HI>all the World,</HI> and will not spare even <HI>Caesar</HI> himself.

In a very little while, they will be all <HI>cut down as the Grass;</HI> Not one of them left standing in the World. We read; Eccl.

Sorry Leaf of <HI>Grass;</HI> No Corner of the <HI>Field</HI> thou standest in, will be <HI>a priviledged Place</HI> where the <HI>Arrest of Death</HI> cannot come upon thee; and where the <HI>Sithe</HI> can∣not reach thee!

<P>But as we read, <HI>As many as came to the place where Aschel fell down and died, stood still,</HI> so coming to such a vast Heap of <HI>Mown Grass,</HI> and seeing so

That we were come once to Realize this thing; <HI>I am one of those whom the Sithe of Death will cut down as the Grass.</HI> This is a very strange thing! The most <HI>Mysterious Point</HI> in all the <HI>Glorious Gospel of the Blessed GOD,</HI> has not more cause, than this Truth which lies every Day before our Eyes, to complain, <HI>Lord, who hath believed it!</HI> Tho' we see that Word every Day fulfilled before our Eves; Heb.

If the <HI>Sithe</HI> find you unprepared, and strike
<PB N="141" REF="002905_0146_0FE6922796BD51D0"/>you, while you are yet in your Sins. your Doom will be That; Psal.

<P N="4">IV. When the Children of Men who are the <HI>Children of Death,</HI> are <HI>taken away with a stroke,</HI> and the Mortal <HI>Sithe cuts us down as the Grass,</HI> 'tis not without something of a <HI>Violence,</HI> that the <HI>stroke</HI> does what it comes for.

First, The <HI>Death</HI> which we call <HI>Vi∣olent,</HI> as it is opposed unto <HI>Natural;</HI> This is no rare thing among the <HI>Prisoners of the Earth.</HI> 'Tis no rare thing to Dy by <HI>Casualties,</HI> or to Dy by <HI>Adversaries.</HI> To Dy like them on whom the <HI>Tow∣er of Siloam</HI> fell, or to Dy like them whose <HI>Blood Pilate sacrificed</HI> Sometimes the <HI>Sithe</HI> strikes with a <HI>Damage</HI> that happens <HI>Accidentally.</HI> Sometimes with a <HI>Mischief</HI> that is done <HI>Intentionally.</HI> We read of some whom the <HI>Sithe</HI> handles at that rate, Job.

Death</HI> appears as our <HI>Enemy;</HI> An <HI>Enemy,</HI> that robs us of all our worldly Possessions; An <HI>E∣nemy</HI> that makes painful Assaults without ceasing upon us; An <HI>Enemy,</HI> which nothing but our <HI>Hearts-Blood</HI> will satisfy. <HI>Thou hast found us, O our Enemy?</HI></P>
<P>This Proposition also shall not be dismissed, without a Pertinent and Important <HI>Admonition.</HI> Can we tell of no way so far to cure our <HI>Aversion</HI> for <HI>Death,</HI> as to take away the <HI>Violence</HI> of the <HI>stroke,</HI> which the <HI>Sithe</HI> must give unto us? Yes; It may be so, that tho' our <HI>Death</HI> come ever so <HI>Violently,</HI> yet it may come <HI>Acceptably,</HI> and we may bear the <HI>Cutting</HI> as indeed an Acceptable kindness of GOD unto us.

The <HI>Death</HI> of People may be <HI>sud∣den,</HI> in this regard, that it <HI>surprizes</HI> them, even when they fancied, <HI>Goods laid up for many Years,</HI> and could perhaps impiously say of a Thing they <HI>thought nothing</HI> of, <HI>I thought no more of it than of my dying Day:</HI> They are <HI>surprized,</HI> with the <HI>Bow-string</HI> served upon them.

It is not to be said, That a Man should <HI>Live every Day, as if he knew it were to be the Day of his Death;</HI> But this must be said, We should <HI>Live every Day, as not knowing, but that it may be the Day of our Death.</HI> It was propounded among the <HI>Remarkables</HI> of the Christian Life; 2. Cor. VI. 9. <HI>As Dying, and behold we live.</HI> How <HI>Re∣markably</HI> would it befriend and bespeak and strengthen a <HI>Religious Life;</HI> and how <HI>Remarkably</HI> would the Horrors of a <HI>sudden Death</HI> be taken off; if we <HI>lived</HI> always <HI>as Dying,</HI> and as having a <HI>sudden stroke</HI> of the <HI>Sithe</HI> impending over us! When we <HI>Pray,</HI> Think, <HI>I may die suddenly, and this may be the last Time of my calling upon GOD.</HI> When we <HI>Hear,</HI> Think, <HI>I may die suddenly, and this may be the last Sermon that ever I spall be instructed from.</HI> When the <HI>Sabbath</HI> arrives, Think, <HI>I may die suddenly, and be gone before another Sabbath.</HI> And, when we Con∣verse with our <HI>Friends,</HI> Think, <HI>I may die suddenly, and this may be my last Conversation with them.</HI> Christian, So <HI>Number thy Days,</HI> as to look for no Number of Days. This will apply thy <HI>Heart unto Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>¶ And now, upon the whole; There are some <HI>Lessons of PIETY,</HI> which, Oh! that they may come upon us, with as much <HI>Efficacy,</HI> as they will with <HI>Pertinency!</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Beware, O standers in the way of <HI>Unavoid∣able Death,</HI> Beware of those Things that may <HI>Hasten</HI> the Stroke of <HI>Death,</HI> and bring the <HI>Sithe</HI> be∣fore
<PB N="147" REF="002905_0152_0FE6922F9A1F7830"/>the Time upon you. <HI>Death</HI> will come fast enough. It will <HI>soon cut you down as the Grass.</HI> The <HI>Sithe,</HI> and what follows unto the Ungodly, <HI>It slum∣bers not.</HI> But some Crimes will bring it on <HI>sooner</HI> than the <HI>Course of Nature</HI> would ripen for it. We read, Eccl VII 17. <HI>Be not overmuch Wicked: Why shouldest thou die before thy Time? Exceeding Sin,</HI> This will bring on <HI>Untimely Death. O Undutiful</HI> Children and Servants; Do you Reform; and no longer persist in your Disobedient and Refractory and Rebellious Behaviour; Or else look that the <HI>Fifth Commandment</HI> will bring on <HI>Anticipations</HI> of the <HI>Sithe</HI> upon you; and forbid your <HI>Days</HI> being <HI>Long in the Land.</HI> Let the Malignant <HI>Revilers</HI> of Good Men, and of them that are Innocent and Industrious Instruments of Good in the World, <HI>Consider their Ways.</HI> Methinks, The <HI>Twelfth</HI> and <HI>Thirteenth</HI> Verses of the <HI>Thirty fourth Psalm,</HI> should stand like a <HI>Flaming Sword</HI> in their way, and make them <HI>stand in Awe, and not Sin,</HI> in that way any more. Let all that use <HI>Dishonesty</HI> in their Dealings, also <HI>Consider their Ways.</HI> While they <HI>make haste to be Rich,</HI> the Thing which is to strip them of all their Ill-gotten <HI>Riches,</HI> does also <HI>make haste:</HI> And, <HI>He who gets Riches, but not by Right, leaves them in the midst of his Days, and at his end shall be a Fool.</HI> Rash Sinner, Do not by thy <HI>Sin</HI> call for the <HI>Sithe;</HI> and quicken the Pace of the <HI>Mower,</HI> that is upon his way unto thee.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Do presently,</HI> what you would certainly do, if you were sure to <HI>Die presently;</HI> and leave no∣thing undone, which under the Stroke of the <HI>Sithe</HI> you will <HI>wish to have done.</HI> O Vain <HI>Mortal,</HI> for
<PB N="148" REF="002905_0153_0FE6929583867358"/>whom <HI>here is no abiding;</HI> What if the <HI>Dead War∣rant</HI> could be shown thee? <HI>This Year thou shalt die;</HI> Or, <HI>A Month shall devour thee.</HI> Wouldest thou not <HI>presently</HI> go thro' a <HI>Process of Repentance;</HI> Wherein thou wilt <HI>pass from Death to Life? Present∣ly,</HI> Confess and Bewail thy Sins, and plead the <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Great Sacrifice</HI> for thy <HI>Pardon? Pre∣sently</HI> give thy self up unto the Lord, and lay hold on the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, and send up vehe∣ment Petitions to the Glorious One to bestow a <HI>New Heart</HI> upon thee, and be in <HI>Agonies</HI> until thou feel a <HI>New Biass</HI> on thy Soul, and the <HI>Love of GOD</HI> planted in thee, as a <HI>Root,</HI> that shall prove a <HI>Tree of Life</HI> unto thee in the <HI>Paradise</HI> above! Then, Let all this be done accordingly; be done immediately! The Advance of the <HI>Sithe</HI> requires that it be done, without any more ado. The Maxim is, <HI>To make Hay while the Sun shines.</HI> While thou hast the Benefit of the Sun shining on thee in a <HI>Day of Grace,</HI> Oh! <HI>Do with thy Might, what thy Hand finds to do. The Thoughts of a Dying Man,</HI> Oh! Come into them. They are the wisest Thoughts that can inspire or direct the <HI>Living.</HI> Our Lord cured the <HI>Blindness</HI> of a Man with putting of <HI>Clay</HI> upon his Eyes. If the <HI>Clay</HI> to which our <HI>Death</HI> will shortly reduce us, were du∣ly applied unto our <HI>Eyes,</HI> what a <HI>True Sight</HI> of Things would it help us to! It was the Wish; Deut. XXXII. 29. <HI>Oh! That they were Wise; that they would Consider their latter End,</HI> There are ma∣ny points of <HI>Prudence:</HI> But, <HI>This I say, Brethren;</HI> The most Finished and Exalted <HI>Prudence</HI> in the World, is, For a Man to <HI>consider</HI> what <HI>Judgment</HI> he will pass upon every thing at his <HI>latter End;</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="002905_0154_0FE69231089CB258"/>how he will Judge of every Thing when he feels the <HI>Sithe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntting him down;</HI> And <HI>consider,</HI> what those things are, the doing whereof will at his <HI>latter End</HI> give the most <HI>Comfortable</HI> or the most <HI>Lamentable</HI> Reflections unto him: And <HI>order his Conversation aright;</HI> Even with a Behaviour which the <HI>Sentiments of a Man</HI> under the <HI>Sithe,</HI> would justi∣fy. O Man going <HI>down to the Dead;</HI> Suppose thy self a Dying, thy Blood boiling, thy Breath fail∣ing, thy Throat rattling, and the <HI>Decretory Hour</HI> come upon thee; <HI>Consider</HI> upon it; <HI>What, what should I wish to have done, at such a critical Time as this?</HI> Regulate thy self in every thing, by what thy <HI>Conscience</HI> will now bring as a <HI>Message from GOD</HI> unto thee.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let us fall before the <HI>Sithe</HI> of the <HI>Destroyer,</HI> with a <HI>livel Faith</HI> of <HI>Rising again,</HI> by the power of a <HI>Redeemer: Dy</HI> Believing and Expecting a <HI>Re∣surrection from the Dead</HI> Of the Patriarchs taken off by the <HI>Sithe,</HI> we read, <HI>All these died in Faith.</HI> Of wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Of a <HI>Good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate after Death;</HI> and of a <HI>Resurrection from the Dead.</HI> We have a <HI>Sure Foun∣dation</HI> of this <HI>Lively Hope,</HI> in the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our Blessed JESUS from the Dead. Our JESUS declared, That an <HI>Hour</HI> shall come, <HI>when He will make all who are in their Graves to hear His Voice and come forth.</HI> As an incontestible Token for this, He foretold His own <HI>Resurrection from the Dead,</HI> on the Third Day after His <HI>Crucifixion.</HI> He did <HI>Rise</HI> as He said He would; And his <HI>Resurrection</HI> has as <HI>Infallible Proofs</HI> as any <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> that ever was in the World. Upon this, an <HI>Austin</HI> would cry out, <HI>Cur desperabo! — Why, why
<PB N="150" REF="002905_0155_0FE6923124237AE8"/>should I despair of his doing on me what he did on him∣self, and for me?</HI> No; This <HI>Deliverer of Souls,</HI> has done enough to satisfy us, of his being a <HI>true Wit∣ness,</HI> in all that he has Reveled concerning a <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> to a <HI>Life of Immortality</HI> for his followers. He has now sufficiently assured us, That he <HI>will Raise and Change ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vile Bodies, by the working of his migh∣ty Power, which can subdue all things unto him.</HI></P>
<P>It looks Melancholy, to see such Heaps of <HI>Grass, cut down</HI> by the <HI>Sithe</HI> of <HI>Death.</HI> But, <HI>Rejoice not o∣ver me, O my Enemy; For tho' I fall, I shall arise.</HI> The coming of our SAVIOUR is thus foretold; Psal. LXXII. 6. <HI>He shall come down like Rain upon the Mown Grass.</HI> This <HI>Rain, O Mown Grass,</HI> will fetch thee to <HI>Life</HI> again. Yea, The quickening SPIRIT of GOD, shall come <HI>like the Dew of Herbs,</HI> upon thee, to <HI>Revive</HI> thee, O Beleever, at that Voice of thy SAVIOUR, <HI>Awake, and Sing, ye who dwell in the Dust.</HI> But in that <HI>Revival,</HI> O what an astonishing <HI>Change</HI> will pass upon thee? In what <HI>Glory,</HI> How Luminous, How Vigorous, How Incorruptible, will thou be <HI>Raised? O Comfort your selves</HI> and one another, <HI>with such words.</HI> Particu∣larly, At <HI>Funerals,</HI> let this be, <HI>The Consolation.</HI> In the mean time, O thou Candidate of Heaven; <HI>Go thy way till the End be.</HI> For, <HI>thou shalt stand in thy Lot at the End;</HI> But in the mean time, <HI>thou shalt Rest;</HI> and be in a <HI>Coelestial Garden of Eden,</HI> where, no Evil shall annoy thee; but thou shalt be <HI>Com∣forted,</HI> with <HI>Visions</HI> and <HI>Enjoyments</HI> of GOD; and be in those <HI>Courts of the Lord,</HI> where <HI>One day will be better than a Thousand</HI> of the best here below.</P>
<P>Come then; Be <HI>Dead</HI> before you <HI>die.</HI> Being <HI>Dead with CHRIST,</HI> and <HI>Crucified unto the World,</HI> and

<P><HI>A Tree—that bringeth forth its Fruit in its Season.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>O <HI>What the Blessings of the Man who is not walking in the Counsel of the Men that are set for Impiety!</HI> The Man <HI>who stands not in the way of sinful Wanderers!</HI> The Man <HI>who sits not in the seat of scornful Cavillers!</HI> The <HI>Blessings</HI> of this God∣ly Man are declared unto us, under the Metaphor of, <HI>A Fruitful Tree.</HI> Wherein there may be some Remembradce of, and some Allusion to, a Passage in the Benediction which the Patriarch bestowed upon <HI>Joseph; A Fruitful Bough by a Well;</HI> of whom we read, <HI>The Lord made all that he did to prosper.</HI> No doubt, here may be a Prophecy of what our Glorious Lord will do for His People, when He
<PB N="154" REF="002905_0159_0FE6923546090F28"/>comes in His Kingdom, after the Fall of <HI>Anti-christ,</HI> when His People shall be the <HI>Branch of His Planting, the Work of His Hands, that He may be Glo∣rified.</HI> But the <HI>Blessings</HI> of every Godly Man, are to be considered in it. And it is purticularly considerable, That his <HI>Blessings</HI> are as much in his <HI>Godliness</HI> it self, as in any Article whatsoever. <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> is <HI>Godliness.</HI> Tis among the singular <HI>Blessings</HI> of a <HI>Godly</HI> Man; That he shall be a <HI>Fruit∣ful</HI> Man; He shall bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto GOD; He shall be a <HI>Tree,</HI> whereof it may be said, [For so it shall be readd,] <HI>Whatsoever it does bear, shall prosper very well.</HI> The <HI>Fruit</HI> shall not be lost.</P>
<P>But in the Text now before us, Behold, An ex∣cellent Property of the <HI>Fruit,</HI> which will be found with the Godly Man. It will be <HI>Seasonable Fruit.</HI> He will <HI>bring forth Fruit in the Season thereof.</HI> We read, Eccl. III. 11. <HI>GOD hath made every thing beautiful in the Season thereof.</HI> Come now, and be∣hold a <HI>Tree</HI> which GOD has made <HI>Beautiful in its Goodness; Its Top is among the Thick Boughs; All the Trees in the Garden of God may envy it.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Fruit</HI> I am now to bring forth, I hope, not <HI>unseasonably</HI> for your Entertainment, and Edifica∣tion, will be This.</P>
<P><HI>The Fruits of PIETY brought forth in the season there∣of, are the Endeavour and the Character of a Godly Man; Yea, in such seasonable Fruits there very much lies the Blessedness of Real Godliness.</HI></P>
<P>The first Thing that I am to do, is to tell you, what are the <HI>Fruits</HI> that are to be found in the <HI>En∣deavour</HI> and the <HI>Character</HI> of a Godly Man. But
<PB N="155" REF="002905_0160_0FE692384C4090F0"/>have I not already said, <HI>The Fruits of PIETY?</HI> You are to be told in one Word, The <HI>Acts</HI> of PIETY are the <HI>Fruits</HI> to be expected from us. When the Glorious One says, Luk. XIII. 7. <HI>I come seeking Fruit:</HI> The Things which He <HI>seeks</HI> are the <HI>Acts</HI> of PIETY, wherewith GOD is to be <HI>acknow∣ledged in all our ways.</HI> When we are directed, <HI>Exercise thy self unto Piety,</HI> tis a Direction unto <HI>Fruitfulness.</HI> To yield <HI>Obedience</HI> unto GOD, is to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto Him. There are <HI>Fruits</HI> in all <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Obedience</HI> to that <HI>Rule,</HI> which GOD has given us, That we may <HI>Glorify</HI> Him, and <HI>Enjoy</HI> Him for ever. It is prescribed unto us, Prov. XXIII. 17 <HI>Be thou in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long.</HI> This will be to <HI>bring forth Fruits unto the Lord, all the Day long.</HI> The <HI>Fruits</HI> required of us, are all those Points, wherein the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is to be exercised. The <HI>Acts</HI> wherein we <HI>live</HI> unto GOD, and mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it our Design to serve and please Him; are the <HI>Fruits</HI> required of us. The <HI>Acts</HI> wherein we prove that we <HI>Love the Lord our GOD with all our Hearts,</HI> and <HI>Love our Neighbours as our∣selves;</HI> are the <HI>Fruits</HI> required of us. The <HI>Acts</HI> wherein we render <HI>Glory to GOD in the highest,</HI> and express <HI>Good Will towards Men,</HI> are the <HI>Fruits</HI> which our GOD has required of us.</P>
<P>But the main Thing that I am to do, is, To Enquire what are the <HI>Seasons</HI> for our <HI>Fruits,</HI> and what are the <HI>Fruits,</HI> with which the several <HI>Seasons</HI> are to be accommodated. I hope, it will be a <HI>Word in Season.</HI> And how <HI>Good</HI> will such a <HI>Word</HI> be, if it be well-hearken'd to?</P>
<P>We read, Eccl. III. 1. <HI>To every thing there is a Season, and a Time to every purpose under Heaven.</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="002905_0161_0FE692386A1210B8"/>Truly, To every <HI>Fruit</HI> there is a <HI>Season;</HI> and a <HI>Time</HI> for every thing that is to be done in our way to <HI>Heaven,</HI> and in pursuance of our <HI>Purpose</HI> to come to <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. There are the <HI>Fruits</HI> of PIETY, for which we have a <HI>Season</HI> every Day, at the Hour of our <HI>Daily Sacrifices.</HI> The <HI>Devotions</HI> wherein we hear GOD speak to us, and GOD hears us also speak to Him; The <HI>Devotions</HI> wherein we <HI>Read</HI> the Word of GOD, and seek the Face of GOD, and <HI>Commune with our own Hearts;</HI> What are these, but so many <HI>Fruits of Piety?</HI> First, there is the <HI>Re∣ligion of the Closet;</HI> So prescribed, Mat. VI. 6. <HI>En∣ter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy Door, Pray to thy Father who is in secret.</HI> And then, there is the <HI>Religion of the Houshold;</HI> So prescribed, Col. IV. 2. <HI>Masters, continue in Prayer, and Watch in the same with Thansgiving, Together with</HI> such as be∣long unto you. Now these <HI>Fruits of Piety,</HI> in every <HI>Morning,</HI> and in every <HI>Evening,</HI> we are to find a <HI>Season</HI> for them. The People of GOD had of old their <HI>Morning Sacrifices,</HI> and their <HI>Evening Sacrifices.</HI> Our <HI>Devotion</HI> are <HI>Spiritual Sacrifices accep∣table to GOD by JESUS CHRIST.</HI> In these <HI>Devo∣tions,</HI> doing the part of <HI>Priests</HI> unto GOD, we are to have both our <HI>Morning Sacrifices,</HI> and our <HI>Even∣ing Sacrifices.</HI> In the <HI>Morning,</HI> there is a <HI>Season</HI> for us to Retire, and Feed upon some <HI>Truths</HI> wholesome to be taken, as we may say, next our Hearts; and then do like him who said, <HI>My Voice thou shalt hear in the Morning, O Lord; In the Morning I will direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up.</HI> In the <HI>Morning</HI> there is a <HI>Season</HI> for us,
<PB N="157" REF="002905_0162_0FE6923EAD5E8C38"/>to call our <HI>Domesticks</HI> together, and after we have also fed them with something from the <HI>Word of Truth,</HI> hereupon to do like him, of whom it is said, <HI>He feared GOD with all his House, and prayed unto GOD always.</HI> In the <HI>Evening</HI> there is a <HI>Season</HI> to Repeat such Devotions; and Renew our Visits unto Heaven. Yea, Some will oftener in a Day than so, find a <HI>Season</HI> for Addresses to Heaven, with some of these <HI>Devotions.</HI> He did so, who could say; Psal. XV. 17. <HI>Evening, Morning, and Noon will I pray and cry aloud.</HI> But in the <HI>Evening,</HI> for the close of all, and that we may <HI>lie down in Peace, and sleep,</HI> and be assured of <HI>dwelling in safety,</HI> have we not a <HI>Season</HI> to Reflect on the <HI>Favours</HI> we have received in the Day, and be Thankful for them? A <HI>Season,</HI> to Reflect on the <HI>Errors</HI> we have committed in the Day, and be humbled for them? A <HI>Season</HI> to Resign our selves and our All, into the Hands of our SAVIOUR, and by some Act or other, put it out of Doubt, that we are in good Terms with Heaven, and in safety for Eternity?</P>
<P>But as an Appendix to our Account of the <HI>Daily Devotions,</HI> wherewith we are to <HI>bring forth Fruit in the Season</HI> thereof; Let the <HI>Table</HI> be brought in. It must not be forgotten, That when we sit down at the <HI>Table,</HI> Now is a <HI>Season</HI> to confess that the Glorious GOD is the giver of our <HI>Daily Bread,</HI> and that we <HI>live not by Bread alone,</HI> but by the <HI>Blessing</HI> of GOD upon it. Now is a <HI>Season</HI> for us to <HI>eat and drink for the Glory of GOD,</HI> intending thereby to fit our selves for the Work which He has assigned us; and Govern our selves by the <HI>Rules of Temperance</HI> which GOD has given us.
<PB N="158" REF="002905_0163_0FE6923EF69217C0"/>Now is a <HI>Season</HI> to think on the <HI>Food which endures to everlasting Life,</HI> and to <HI>feed</HI> those that are about us, with a <HI>Communication</HI> that may <HI>Edify</HI> them.</P>
<P N="2">II. There are the <HI>Fruits</HI> of Piety, for which we have a <HI>Season,</HI> as often as any <HI>Ordinances</HI> of <HI>Public Worship</HI> are to be attended on. We read, Psal. XCII. 13. <HI>They that are planted in the House of the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts of our GOD; They shall bring forth Fruit.</HI> Verily, as often as we come into the <HI>House of the Lord,</HI> we have a <HI>Season</HI> to <HI>bring forth Fruit</HI> unto our GOD. Yea, We should still come hither with such <HI>Ends</HI> moving of us to come, that our very coming it self should be to <HI>bring forth Fruit</HI> unto our GOD. We have our precious Liberties, to do that thing, <HI>I will bless the Lord in the Congregations.</HI> We have especially <HI>One Day</HI> in a Week, allow'd us for this purpose. With an Eye to the <HI>Fruits of Piety,</HI> which we have now and here a Season for, our Dispositions are to be those; <HI>My Soul does flame with Thirst for GOD, ev'n for the Living GOD: When shall I come, and when appear before the Face of GOD?</HI> And those, <HI>Lord, Better than a Thousand is One Day within thy Courts; I on the Threshold chuse to keep in the House of my GOD, rather than have my Dwelling in the Tents of Wickedness.</HI> When the <HI>Prayers</HI> are made in the House of GOD, Now is a <HI>Season</HI> to accompany the <HI>Confessions</HI> and <HI>Petitions</HI> that are offer'd up un∣to GOD, with a Soul attentively coming into them, and charitably bespeaking for all the People, a share in the Kindnesses of <HI>Our Father in the Heavens.</HI> When the <HI>Psalms</HI> are sung in the House of GOD, Now is a <HI>Season,</HI> to form some
<PB N="159" REF="002905_0164_0FE692404F25BF20"/>Holy <HI>Note,</HI> and some Holy <HI>Wish,</HI> from every Verse, and with <HI>Grace in our Hearts,</HI> make a <HI>Me∣lody to the Lord.</HI> When the <HI>Sermons</HI> are preached in the House of GOD, Now is a <HI>Season</HI> to <HI>Receive the Truth in the love of it,</HI> and make the <HI>Echo's</HI> of a Consenting Soul unto all that passes in them; and send up numberless <HI>Ejaculations</HI> unto Heaven; those Ejaculations, <HI>Lord, I own it;</HI> or, <HI>Lord I ask it!</HI> in the Hearing of what is brought from thence unto us. The <HI>Baptism</HI> of the Lord administred in the House of our GOD affords us a <HI>Season,</HI> over again to Lament our own <HI>Original Sin,</HI> and im∣plore a Deliverance from it by the Blood and Power of our Great REDEEMER; and over∣again <HI>lay hold of the Covenant of GOD</HI> for our selves and ours; and also to wish well unto the increa∣sing Families of the Neighbourhood. But then, When our SAVIOUR sets the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD as <HI>Olive-Plants</HI> about His <HI>Table,</HI> Oh! what a <HI>Sea∣son</HI> have we there to bring forth <HI>all manner of plea∣sant Fruits unto the Beloved of our Souls!</HI> Now is a <HI>Season</HI> to Admire and Embrace a CHRIST <HI>evi∣dently set forth as Crucified before our Eyes;</HI> and be Ravished in the <HI>sweet Meditation,</HI> wherewith Man may now <HI>eat the Food of Angels.</HI> Now is a <HI>Season,</HI> to make all the Sallies of a <HI>Repenting</HI> and a <HI>Believ∣ing</HI> Soul, and a Soul making an Oblation of it self unto GOD in the Flames of Love: O <HI>Spiknard,</HI> Now send out thy pleasant Smell! Now is a <HI>Sea∣son,</HI> to strengthen and confirm the <HI>Resolutions</HI> of an <HI>Heart fixed</HI> for the Ways of GOD. Yea, Now is a <HI>Season</HI> to take the Comforts of all the <HI>very great and precious Promises,</HI> which are now <HI>sealed</HI> unto us, and <HI>Rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of GOD,</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="002905_0165_0FE6924072C06A98"/>which we shall see when our Blessed JESUS brings us to <HI>sit in the Heavenly Places with Him.</HI> I will add this one thing more; If <HI>on the First Day of the Week,</HI> there be <HI>Gatherings,</HI> of what <HI>every one has laid by him in store,</HI> out of what GOD has <HI>prospered</HI> him withal; Now is a <HI>Season</HI> for us to bring the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> which <HI>GOD is well-pleased</HI> with∣al. Now say, <HI>Gracious GOD, Wilt thou accept this little Quitrent, which confesses, that I owe my All un∣to thee!</HI> Even the Widows <HI>Two Mites</HI> are <HI>Good Fruits</HI> unto GOD. But, when I said, <HI>We have one Day in a Week,</HI> thus to <HI>draw near</HI> unto the GOD, whom it is <HI>good for us to draw near</HI> unto, I did not say All, that might be said. For we have our <HI>Lectures</HI> too; In which we have a <HI>Season</HI> for those <HI>Fruits,</HI> that our GOD looks to find in the <HI>Fields of Zion.</HI> What <HI>Fruits</HI> may we both taste, and yield, if we made a due Resort unto those <HI>Assemblies</HI> of GOD?

<P N="3">III. There are <HI>Fruits</HI> of PIETY, for which we have a <HI>Season,</HI> very often when we come into a∣ny <HI>Company.</HI> The <HI>Tongue</HI> of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> is com∣pared unto a <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> because of the <HI>Fruits</HI> which it brings forth unto them that are about him. And thus we read; Prov. XII. 14. <HI>A Man shall be satisfied with Good, by the Fruit if his Mouth.</HI> Be sure, <HI>Fruitless Visits</HI> are Things which will be avoided by the <HI>Wise</HI> Men, who take the <HI>way that is Above.</HI> When we are upon the <HI>Visiting</HI> Account,
<PB N="161" REF="002905_0166_0FE692479176D728"/>shall not we do well to think, <HI>What Fruit, even what Good, may this Visit afford a Season for?</HI> The <HI>Visiters</HI> that are so kind as to come unto us, may awaken the like Thoughts in our Minds. If the <HI>Company</HI> which we come into, be <HI>Superiour</HI> to us, Now is a <HI>Season</HI> for us to <HI>get Good</HI> by them. We may, by <HI>Questions</HI> prudently proposed, put them upon bringing forth <HI>Fruit,</HI> for our Instruction. But if we are more on the level with our <HI>Company,</HI> we have more commonly, Now a <HI>Season</HI> to <HI>do Good</HI> unto them. Let us now shun the <HI>Raw Fruits</HI> of Impertinences; the <HI>Sowre Fruits</HI> of Controversies; the <HI>Stinking Fruits</HI> of an Obscaene and <HI>Rotten Com∣munication.</HI> Our <HI>Conferences</HI> ought always to have a Tendency to something that is <HI>Good.</HI> Now is a <HI>Season,</HI> as for the <HI>Dispatch</HI> of the Affairs which we come upon, so for them that <HI>Fear the Lord</HI> so to <HI>speak unto one another,</HI> that they need not be asha∣med, if their Talk be found <HI>written</HI> in a <HI>Book of Remembrance</HI> before the Lord. Christians, When you are together, do Good unto one another; <HI>In∣form</HI> one another; <HI>Quicken</HI> one another; <HI>Comfort</HI> one another. Do your Best, that you may be the Better for one another. Now and then propose it, <HI>What Good may be done before we part?</HI> Oh! what <HI>Fruit</HI> would be brought forth <HI>in the Season</HI> thereof, if Good Men when they come together, would more see to it, that their <HI>coming together</HI> may be <HI>for the Better and not for the Worse!</HI> But I know, what I say will have little Notice taken of it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. There are <HI>Fruits</HI> of PIETY, for which we have a <HI>Season,</HI> when the Business of our <HI>Temporal Calling</HI> is in its Prosecution. Every <HI>Israelite</HI> must
<PB N="162" REF="002905_0167_0FE69247AC1971A8"/>be able to make a suitable Reply, to the Interroga∣tory once put unto the Sons of <HI>Israel; What is your Occupation?</HI> It is directed, 1. Thess. IV. 11. <HI>Study to do your own Business.</HI> Indeed This Thing it self, is to bring forth <HI>Fruit in the Season</HI> thereof: When a Man minds and plies his <HI>own Business</HI> in the <HI>Sea∣son thereof.</HI> The <HI>Business</HI> of the <HI>Personal Calling,</HI> wherein a Man deserves well of <HI>Humane Society,</HI> and accordingly demands upon it; This is part of the <HI>Fruit,</HI> that should be found upon us. For which cause every Man that is employ'd in any <HI>Business</HI> which is of use to <HI>Humane Society,</HI> may challenge what that Maxim of Religion has or∣dered for him; <HI>Honour all Men.</HI> The very <HI>Wheel∣barrow</HI> is to be with Respect look'd upon. But then, O Christian, Wilt thou not bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto GOD as well as unto <HI>Man,</HI> in the <HI>Business</HI> of thy <HI>Personal Calling?</HI> And wilt thou not be at work for <HI>Heaven,</HI> in what thou hast to do upon <HI>Earth?</HI> How Nobly, how Bravely, how Plea∣santly, and with what <HI>Songs in the House of thy Pil∣grimage</HI> will the work proceed, if it may be so! Truly, Now 'tis a <HI>Season</HI> for thee, to bring a <HI>Right Principle</HI> into its Operation, and think, <HI>Because GOD my SAVIOUR has ordered this Business for me, Therefore 'tis that I will now Cheerfully do what my Hand finds to do. I will Obey GOD my SAVIOUR, and be emply'd as a Servant of His, in what my Hand finds to do.</HI> But then, all the <HI>Industry,</HI> all the <HI>Ho∣nesty,</HI> all the <HI>Alacrity,</HI> in carrying on thy <HI>Business,</HI> from this <HI>Right Principle,</HI> which thou hast now a <HI>Season</HI> for; This also will be a <HI>Fruit</HI> well resent∣ed with GOD. And canst thou not Now like∣wise find a <HI>Season,</HI> to have thy Mind filled with
<PB N="163" REF="002905_0168_0FE6929D58062580"/>the <HI>Precious Thoughts</HI> of GOD, until it may be said, <HI>How great is the Sum of them?</HI> Certainly, The less thy <HI>Business</HI> does require of <HI>Intense Thoughts</HI> upon it, and where the <HI>Hand</HI> is more engaged than the <HI>Brain,</HI> and the <HI>Hand</HI> also goes on with a Repetition of the same Thing a thousand times over, Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> to multiply the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of one whose <HI>Conversation is in Heaven.</HI> The Skill of making <HI>Occasional Reflections,</HI> on Visible and Various <HI>Occurrences;</HI> Oh! the lovely <HI>Fruits,</HI> which it would help the Christian to abound withal! What <HI>Life and Peace</HI> would such such a <HI>Spiritually-minded</HI> Christian be bless'd withal! It may be yet further said, That they who in the <HI>Shop</HI> spend very much Time in <HI>waiting</HI> for Customers, it may be, more than in <HI>tending</HI> upon them; These have Now a <HI>Season</HI> for very much <HI>Reading</HI> of such Things, as may fill the <HI>Chambers of their Souls with precious and pleasant Riches.</HI> My Friends, <HI>Consider what I say,</HI> and GOD give you <HI>Understanding.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. There are <HI>Fruits</HI> of PIETY, for which we have a <HI>Season,</HI> when our GOD bestows <HI>Comforta∣ble Things</HI> upon us. There are <HI>Cultivations</HI> by our GOD upon us, in all His <HI>Dispensations</HI> towards us. There are particularly so, when He dispenses un∣to us, any Agreeable Things, and we have His <HI>Light shining on our Tabernacles.</HI> The Glorious GOD now makes a Demand of <HI>Agreeable Fruits</HI> from the Chil∣dren of Men, when He <HI>makes an Hedge about them,</HI> and <HI>blesses the Works of their Hands,</HI> and their <HI>Sub∣stance is increased in the Land.</HI> His <HI>Wrath</HI> fell upon one for this; 2 Chron. XXXII. 25. <HI>He rendred not again according to the Benefit that was done unto him.</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="002905_0169_0FE69248DE1A67D8"/>Syrs, Are you in <HI>Prosperity?</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you to <HI>serve the Lord with Gladness of Heart, in the Abundance of all things which He has given you:</HI> A <HI>Season</HI> for you to maintain a most Intimate Com∣munion with GOD; and for you to <HI>Do Good</HI> in a most plentiful and copious Manner to all that are about you. Yea, Upon every Article of <HI>Prospe∣rity,</HI> which your Lives are sweetened withal; Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you, to <HI>Give Thanks unto the Lord,</HI> who is <HI>Good,</HI> and whose <HI>Mercy endureth for ever.</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you to be Inquisitive, <HI>What shall I render to the Lord for all His Benefits?</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you, to be full of Projecti∣ons, How you may bring others to share with you in all the <HI>Blessings of Goodness.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. There are <HI>Fruits</HI> of PIETY, for which we have a <HI>Season,</HI> when our GOD inflicts <HI>Calamitous Things</HI> upon us. There are some Strokes in <HI>learn∣ing the Statutes of GOD,</HI> which are to be the pe∣culiar care of them, who would be able to say, <HI>Tis good for me that I am afflicted:</HI> Things peculi∣arly calculated for a <HI>Day of Adversity.</HI> When we are <HI>Chastened</HI> of GOD what are the Things to be look'd for? Those Things; Heb. XII. 11 <HI>The peaceable Fruits of Righteousness.</HI> O you that have an <HI>Heart stouping with Heaviness;</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you, to <HI>pour out your Souls unto the Lord,</HI> that so you may be <HI>no more sad.</HI> You have been so taught of GOD; <HI>Is any among you Afflicted? Let him pray.</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you, To <HI>Search and to Try your Ways, and to Turn unto the Lord;</HI> and not be <HI>Fools bray'd in a Mortar.</HI> You are to find out the <HI>Errand</HI> which your Troubles come upon, and see that it be well comply'd withal; <HI>Reform</HI> what
<PB N="165" REF="002905_0170_0FE64697BA968900"/>your <HI>Affliction</HI> comes to Rebuke you for; <HI>Perform</HI> what your <HI>Affliction</HI> comes to Excite you to; And say, <HI>I have born Chistisement; I will not offend any more.</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for <HI>Patience</HI> to have its <HI>perfect Work;</HI> And when <HI>Killing Things</HI> befall you, 'tis the <HI>Season</HI> for you to make a mighty Progress in <HI>Dying</HI> unto Creatures; in patiently submitting to be <HI>stript</HI> of every Thing, and have a CHRIST the only Thing lest Alive unto you, and find in a CHRIST alone every Thing that you have a Re∣lish for. But what shall we do, if there be the Hand or Tongue of <HI>Man,</HI> in what we suffer? If <HI>Men</HI> rise up against us, Revile us, Injure us; Yea, <HI>Floods of Ungodly Men</HI> keep Dashing and Roaring upon us? Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for us, with <HI>Meekness of Wisdom,</HI> to take the True Way of dealing with, and shaking off, a <HI>Viper.</HI> If <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Iniquity are prevailing against us,</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for us to use the best Methods, that our <HI>Transgressions</HI> may be <HI>purged away.</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for us to be but the more <HI>zealous of Good Works,</HI> and to be <HI>Barked</HI> into a greater Speed in <HI>Runnig the way</HI> before us. Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for us, Generously to Forgive Injuries, and <HI>Overcome Evil with Good.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. There are <HI>Fruits</HI> of PIETY, which every <HI>Age</HI> of Life, gives a Distinguishing <HI>Season</HI> for. Most certainly, The Lively Oracles of GOD, so distinctly calling on, <HI>Fathers,</HI> and <HI>Young Men,</HI> and <HI>Little Children;</HI> so distinctly calling on <HI>Young Men</HI> and <HI>Maidens, Old Men</HI> and <HI>Children;</HI> These inti∣mate, that every Age is a <HI>Season</HI> for some <HI>Fruit</HI> unto GOD.</P>
<P>More particularly. Are there not <HI>Fruits</HI> which <HI>Old People</HI> have a singular <HI>Season</HI> for; and are most
<PB N="166" REF="002905_0171_0FE6929ED6340D30"/>singularly obliged unto? No doubt of it! We read of some; Psal. XCII. 14. <HI>They shall bring forth Fruit in Old Age.</HI> My Neighbours, Has GOD brought you to be so stricken in Years, that you may say, <HI>Now I am Old and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay-headed;</HI> Ve∣rily, Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you to get and keep your <HI>Evidences for Heaven</HI> so clear, that you may be ready upon the first Call, to go away Tri∣umphing, and receive the <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> not at all terrified at his Approaches, but saying, <HI>O Messen∣ger of Heaven, Thou art welcome to me!</HI> Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you to set an excellent <HI>Pattern</HI> of Serious Gravity; of a Soul weaned from a <HI>World,</HI> which you have upon a long Trial, found so fill'd with <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation;</HI> of an entire and profound Submission to the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD in all Events; And with such a <HI>Pattern</HI> of all Goodness, to be full of <HI>Savoury Discourses,</HI> and continually dropping wholsome Admonitions on those that may be reached by them. Now tis a <HI>Season</HI> for you, to sit loose from all things here below, and have your Thoughts and Hopes and Joys exceedingly ap∣plied unto the <HI>Everlasting Habitations</HI> which you are quickly to be <HI>received</HI> into. And above all, Get a Soul as full of a CHRIST as ever you can: Gather a <HI>Double Fortion</HI> of that <HI>Manna,</HI> now your <HI>Sabbath</HI> is coming on! O Thou <HI>Hoary Head,</HI> thus <HI>found in the way of Righteousness:</HI> Thou art a <HI>Tree,</HI> which we will keep with us as long as ever we can. Thy Fall shall be only to Transplant thee into the <HI>Paradise</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>But then, Oh! That <HI>Young People</HI> would be more concerned for the <HI>Fruits</HI> which ought in this their most proper <HI>Season</HI> to be sound upon
<PB N="167" REF="002905_0172_0FE6924900602160"/>them! <HI>Children,</HI> Don't you hear your GOD say∣ing Mic. VII. 1. <HI>My Soul has desired the First Ripe Fruits?</HI> The <HI>Fruits of Righteousness</HI> which are grate∣ful to GOD from <HI>All People,</HI> are more eminently so from <HI>Young People.</HI> Oh! Be not so <HI>Unrighteous</HI> as to withold them. You are in that <HI>Season</HI> where∣of it may Emphatically be said, <HI>Behold, Now is the Acceptable Time.</HI> Now if Ever; Now is the <HI>Sea∣son,</HI> for you to <HI>Cleanse your Ways;</HI> Let the <HI>Young Man</HI> do so. He'l do it, if he <HI>take heed, according to the Word.</HI> Now is the <HI>Season</HI> for you to <HI>Remember your Creator;</HI> Tis to be done <HI>in Youth, before the Evil Days come.</HI> Now is the <HI>Season</HI> for you, to <HI>know the Holy Scriptures,</HI> that you may be <HI>made wise unto Salvation;</HI> and <HI>seek</HI> that <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which will be <HI>found</HI> by the <HI>early seekers</HI> of it. Now is the <HI>Sea∣son</HI> for you to make a Recognition of the <HI>Bonds</HI> which were in your <HI>Baptism</HI> laid upon you; and <HI>from this Time say</HI> unto GOD, <HI>Thou art my Father, and my Saviour, and the Guide of my Youth.</HI> Now is the <HI>Season</HI> for you to be <HI>Espoused</HI> unto your SA∣VIOUR; and upon His Astonishing Proposal to make you <HI>His own,</HI> Heartily to answer, <HI>Lord, I am Thine, save me!</HI> You, You are They, to whom your SAVIOUR says, <HI>O my Dove, Let me hear thy Voice; for sweet is thy Voice unto me.</HI> Will you Now, even in the <HI>Season</HI> of it, Let Him <HI>Hear the Voice of your Supplications?</HI> And therein that <HI>Voice, Lord, I am sorry for my Sin!</HI> That <HI>Voice, Lord, In the shadow of thy Wings I make my Refuge!</HI> That <HI>Voice; Lord, Thou art my Portion, I have said, That I will keep thy Word.</HI> Child, As young a <HI>Tree</HI> as thou art, such <HI>Fruits</HI> may and should be found up∣on thee; Oh! That they may be so! This, This
<PB N="168" REF="002905_0173_0FE6929EF3F9BD88"/>is the fittest <HI>Season</HI> for them. Such <HI>Rathe-ripes,</HI> what a <HI>Price</HI> would be set upon them!</P>
<P>Yea, But who can Reckon up, all the <HI>Fruits,</HI> which, O <HI>Fruitful</HI> Christian, thou mayst find a <HI>Season</HI> for?</P>
<P>Scarce can I forbear making this Observation, That all the <HI>Four Seasons</HI> of the <HI>Year,</HI> may be made so many <HI>Seasons,</HI> for those <HI>Desires</HI> of PIETY to be pursued, that shall be most elegantly adapted un∣to them. Very particularly; There are what may be called, <HI>Supplicationes Hyemales,</HI> or <HI>Winter Desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> which the Accidents of the <HI>Winter</HI> make a <HI>Season</HI> to insist upon. Can we see the <HI>Sun</HI> at such a Distance from us? And shall it not now be a <HI>Season</HI> to pray, <HI>Lord, let not my Soul, nor the World, languish in a Distance from my SAVIOUR?</HI> Can we see the <HI>Snow?</HI> And shall it not now be a <HI>Season</HI> for us to pray; <HI>Lord, let the Blood of my SAVIOUR make my Guilty and Stained Soul, whiter than the Snow?</HI> Can we see the <HI>Ice?</HI> And shall it not now be a <HI>Season</HI> for us to pray; <HI>Lord, Keep me from Falls into Sin; And, Let not my Activities for thy Service be frozen up?</HI> Can we see our <HI>Double Garments?</HI> And shall it not now be a <HI>Season</HI> for us to pray; <HI>Lord, Clothe me with the Garments of Righteousness and Salvation?</HI> Can we see our <HI>Fuel</HI> that warms us? And shall it not now be a <HI>Season</HI> for us to pray; <HI>Lord, make me Fervent in spirit for thy Service; But O save me from the Fiery Indignation which is to devour thy Adversaries?</HI> Can we feel the <HI>Cold,</HI> which <HI>who can stand</HI> before? And shall it not now affect us to think; <HI>Who can stand before the Wrath of the Lord Almighty?</HI> Can we see the <HI>Fruitless Face of the Earth?</HI> And shall it not now
<PB N="169" REF="002905_0174_0FE6924EC3D3C450"/>be a <HI>Season</HI> for us to Hope; <HI>Lord, Tho' my Life he too much without Good Fruits, yet thou canst bring me to be Fruitful in Good Works; And tho' the Face of the World at this Day be horribly Barren and Wretched, yet I will Hope in thee to give it one Day a better Face, and bring on a Better Time.</HI></P>
<P>Christians, other <HI>Trees</HI> bring not forth <HI>Fruit</HI> in the <HI>Winter.</HI> 'Tis not a <HI>Season</HI> for it. We may be most <HI>Fruitful</HI> in the <HI>Winter.</HI> Some <HI>Fruit</HI> is then best in Season.</P>
<P>But then, for the Other Three <HI>Seasons</HI> of the Year, why may we not be awakened also, by the Circumstances of the <HI>Seasons,</HI> to form <HI>Supplicati∣ons,</HI> which may be <HI>seasonably</HI> insisted on?</P>

<P><PB N="171" REF="002905_0176_0FE692A474560E58"/>
The First is This. Make it your Ambition to <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD, as <HI>Explicitly</HI> as may be, in all your <HI>Actions,</HI> and all your <HI>Enjoyments.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A <HI>Day of Patience</HI> for <HI>one Year more</HI> is then obtained for a <HI>Barren Fig-tree.</HI> After the utmost Hazard of Destruction, for a <HI>Barrenness</HI> of <HI>Three Years,</HI> an Intercession is made, for <HI>one year more,</HI> to be allow'd. It was begg'd, <HI>Lord, Let it a∣lone this Year also:</HI> that so a further Cultivation might be employ'd for the Cure of the offensive <HI>Barrenness.</HI> But, Behold the Consequence to be expected of the Grant thus made for <HI>Thu Year also.</HI> A Thing highly worthy to be deeply considered by us; To be so at all times; But very particu∣larly so, on a Day, when we see the <HI>first Day</HI> of a <HI>New Year</HI> granted unto us.</P>
<P>The <HI>whole World</HI> had been very <HI>Barren</HI> of good Men, and of good Things, for no less than <HI>Three</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="002905_0178_0FE69251A895A9E8"/>Thousands of Years. In the <HI>Fourth,</HI> our SAVI∣OUR made Intercession for Mankind, which had hitherto stood as a <HI>Barren Fig tree.</HI> Upon this In∣tercession the Great GOD staid unto the End of the <HI>Fourth.</HI> But then our SAVIOUR Himself was brought forth, and the Effusions of the Holy SPIRIT upon Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kind, then produced those other <HI>Fruits,</HI> for which the World stands unto his Day.</P>
<P>In making this Observation, I do not say, That I have made an Exposition of the Parable now before us. But I will observe, That our SAVI∣OUR being thus brought forth, we have here set before us, in a Parable, some of the precious <HI>Fruits,</HI> which the Church of GOD has found, in Him and from Him, who is indeed the <HI>Tree of Life.</HI> Our Lord had newly warned the Jews, That if they did not <HI>Repent,</HI> they must <HI>perish.</HI> Now, since it might be Enquired, How and why they must <HI>perish,</HI> we have here in a Parable, an Answer to that Enquiry. The Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> in his well∣known Song had compared the <HI>Land</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> unto a <HI>Vineyard.</HI> Our SAVIOUR, not without some Allusion to that S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> here com∣pares the <HI>Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> unto a <HI>Barren Fig∣tree</HI> in that <HI>Vineyard.</HI> It is here foretold, That GOD would by a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man Axe</HI> cut down the Tree, for its U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fruitfulness. However, <HI>there is Hope of the Tree; tho' it be cut down, it shall sprout again, and the Tender Branches thereof will not cease.</HI> 'Twil do so at the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> But the Comparison may be carried on, unto more of par∣ticularity. O Man, <HI>Thou art the Tree</HI> Every Person under the Means of Grace may be compa∣red unto a <HI>Fig-tree.</HI> The Flight which our Fallen
<PB N="174" REF="002905_0179_0FE69258AC4EF8C8"/>Parents presently made unto a <HI>Fig-tree</HI> for their Cover and Relief, has added unto our Claim for the Resemblance. Every Person who does not improve in PIETY under the Means of Grace, may be compared unto a <HI>Barren Fig-tree.</HI> But the Danger of such <HI>unfruitfulness!</HI> The Doom of <HI>Cutting down</HI> is passed upon the <HI>Barren Fig-tree,</HI> after an Expectation excended for <HI>Three Years</HI> to see <HI>Fruit</HI> upon it. And Intercession is made, for <HI>One Year more</HI> of Expectation. The Consequence of what shall be found upon the Expectation to be still kept for <HI>This Year also,</HI> is here declared unto us. And an awful DOCTRINE shall introduce yet a fuller Declaration of it.</P>
<Q><HI>When the too-unfruitful Children of Men, have one Year more of the Divine Patience obtained for them, it is of the last Consequence, what Fruit shall in This Year be found upon them.</HI></Q>
<P>Let us, my Brethren, <HI>begin the Year,</HI> with some Admonitions of PIETY, which may be of use to us <HI>every Day of the Year,</HI> or, every Day that the <HI>GOD of our Life</HI> shall please to allow us in the Year.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Good Fruit</HI> is to be expected from all that have the means of growing Wiser and Better, employ'd upon them: A <HI>Good Fruit</HI> of such means. The Voice of GOD, Oh! Voice more than any Thunder to be trembled at! — is this, <HI>Behold, I come seeking for Fruit!</HI> People whom GOD places under the means of becoming what they should be, ought to be a <HI>Fruitful People.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="002905_0180_0FE69258EE032108"/>
But what is the <HI>Fruit</HI> that is to be looked for? PIETY does in one Word, express the <HI>Fruit</HI> which GOD expects from us all. PIETY and a <HI>Growth</HI> in PIETY. The <HI>Fruit</HI> looked for, is found in the Progress of a <HI>Soul Returning to GOD.</HI> GOD our Maker, has imprinted on our Soul, a <HI>Tendency</HI> for a <HI>Return</HI> to Him: In His Gospel, He does direct and Assist this <HI>Natural Tendency.</HI> We do in the ways of Sin <HI>Depart</HI> from Him, unto <HI>Creatures.</HI> We <HI>Return</HI> to GOD in the PIETY, which Remem∣bers our Obligations to our GOD that made us, and Endeavours to find That in <HI>Him,</HI> which we vainly sought in <HI>Creatures.</HI> Just so much Progress as we make in this <HI>Return to GOD,</HI> just so much <HI>Fruit</HI> is to be found upon us. To <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD; This is to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto Him. Every Act of that <HI>Life,</HI> which lies in seeking and serving, and pleasing of GOD, is part of the <HI>Fruit</HI> which is required from us. Or, to use another Term for it: <HI>Good Fruit</HI> is found in every Religious Com∣pliance with the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD. <HI>All manner of precious Fruits are laid up for the Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved of our Souls,</HI> in those Demands, Mic VI. 8. <HI>To Do Justice, and love Mercy, and walk Humbly with thy GOD.</HI> And, Tit. II. 12. <HI>To live soberly, and Righteously, and God∣lily in this present World.</HI> Every <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD in the Soul, 'tis a <HI>Good Fruit.</HI> Such Things are cal∣led, Gal. V. 22. <HI>The Fruits of the Spirit.</HI> Every stroke in the work of <HI>Grace,</HI> produced by the Holy Spirit of GOD, in the chosen People of GOD, is a <HI>Good Fruit</HI> in the Soul. He that becom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a <HI>Gra∣cious</HI> Christian, becomes a <HI>Fruitful</HI> Christian. An <HI>Holy</HI> Christian has his <HI>Fruit unto Holiness.</HI> And all <HI>Gracious Actions</HI> are so many <HI>Fruits</HI> of a Christian
<PB N="176" REF="002905_0181_0FE692A493C77A00"/>that has the <HI>Root of the Matter</HI> in him. They are called, Phil I. 11. <HI>The Fruits of Righteousness.</HI> There are <HI>Good Fruits,</HI> in those which are called, <HI>The right Thoughts of the Righteous.</HI> There are <HI>Good Fruits</HI> in those <HI>Words,</HI> which make the <HI>Tongue of the Righte∣ous as a Tree of Life.</HI> The <HI>Good Works</HI> of the Righ∣teous, are <HI>Good Fruits.</HI> There are <HI>Fruits</HI> in our <HI>Devotions; Fruits</HI> in our <HI>Benignities; Good Fruits</HI> in all those good Things, wherein we render <HI>Glory to GOD in the Highest,</HI> and express <HI>Good Will to∣wards Men.</HI></P>
<P>Will you hear the <HI>Good Fruit</HI> expected from you? My Hearers, Give Attention to the Demands of Heaven upon you. 'Tis demanded, That you Repent of <HI>Sin,</HI> and Believe on CHRIST, and give yourselves up unto GOD. It is demanded, That you place your <HI>Love,</HI> and your <HI>Hope,</HI> and your <HI>Joy,</HI> in the Great GOD, and <HI>walk with Him,</HI> and have <HI>your Eye,</HI> continually unto Him and be mind∣ful of <HI>Hu Eye</HI> upon you. It is demanded, That you be <HI>Diligent</HI> in your Callings, and <HI>Ingenuous</HI> in your Dealings, and <HI>Useful</HI> unto your Neighbours.</P>
<P>It is demanded, That you carry it well in your several <HI>Relations,</HI> and so treat your several <HI>Rela∣tives</HI> as to <HI>Adorn the Doctrine of GOD your SAVI∣OUR.</HI> It is demanded, That you pay suitable <HI>Acknowledgements</HI> unto GOD under His various <HI>Dispensations</HI> unto you: And, finally, That you place not your <HI>Happiness</HI> in <HI>This World,</HI> but in the Enjoyments of that <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> where GOD shall be <HI>All in All.</HI> Verily, you are <HI>unfruitful,</HI> if such Things as these be not found upon you. Be sure; An Unregenerate Sinner is a <HI>Dead</HI> Thing; a <HI>Tree</HI> that has no <HI>Good Fruits</HI> at all upon it. A
<PB N="177" REF="002905_0182_0FE692A6E9D78470"/>Christian too, in whom the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD is not very Conspicuous, and who does <HI>Little Good;</HI> a <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eble</HI> Christian, tis pity he should have the Ho∣nour to be called, A <HI>Fruitful</HI> One.</P>
<P N="2">II. While Men continue <HI>Unfruitful</HI> there is from the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atience</HI> of an Offended GOD, obtained for them, <HI>One Year</HI> after another, with an Opportu∣nity for <HI>Good Fruits</HI> to be found upon them. Yea, After <HI>Three Years</HI> of looking for <HI>Good Fruit,</HI> there is often <HI>One Year</HI> more obtained, that it may be seen, what <HI>Good Fruit</HI> may be found upon us.</P>
<P>One Thing to be Remarked is, That the <HI>Bar∣ren Tree,</HI> is an <HI>Offence</HI> unto the Glorious GOD. Of an <HI>Unfruitful</HI> Thing, we read, Heb. VI. 8. <HI>It is nigh unto cursing.</HI> Alas, The <HI>Unfruitful</HI> have the <HI>Wrath of GOD abiding</HI> on them. The <HI>Unfruitful</HI> are they with whom <HI>GOD is Angry every Day. Un∣fruitfulness</HI> is the Grand Crime, for <HI>which the Wrath of GOD comes on the Children of Disobedience.</HI> Even so provoking a Sight unto Heaven is a <HI>Barren Tree,</HI> that it is a Wonder the Fate of the <HI>Tree</HI> in the Vision of the Chaldean Emperour comes not upon it; A Wonder, that an <HI>Holy Watcher</HI> coming down from Heaven do not <HI>cry aloud,</HI> and say, <HI>Hew down the Tree.</HI> But yet it is Remark∣able, That the <HI>Patience</HI> of the Glorious GOD bears <HI>One Year after another,</HI> with the <HI>Barren Tree.</HI> So is that Word fulfilled; Isa. XXX. 18. <HI>The Lord waits that He may be Gracious.</HI> The <HI>Ax</HI> is indeed lifted up The <HI>Barren Tree</HI> is ready for the stroke of the <HI>Ax.</HI> But there is obtained a Liberty for the <HI>Barren Tree,</HI> to stand yet <HI>One Year more.</HI> And how is it obtained? A Seasonable <HI>Intercession</HI> comes in
<PB N="178" REF="002905_0183_0FE6925A4B2A90F8"/>to obtain it; <HI>Lord, Let it alone this One Year also.</HI> So <HI>One Year more</HI> is added unto the <HI>Day of Pati∣ence.</HI> The Enquiry may be; Whose <HI>Intercession</HI> is it, that prevails on this Occasion? Be sure, No <HI>Intercession</HI> can signify any thing for a Sinner, without That of our SAVIOUR. 'Tis our SA∣VIOUR, who is our <HI>Intercessor.</HI> Tis He, of whom we are told, Heb. VII. 25. <HI>He ever lives to make Intercession for us.</HI> And indeed, an <HI>Authoritative Intercession</HI> can be made by none but Him. The <HI>Day of Patience</HI> indulged unto <HI>Reprobates,</HI> even This, is owing to our SAVIOUR. Our SAVIOUR <HI>Intercedes,</HI> that GOD may be Glorified, by length∣ening out the <HI>Day of Patience,</HI> to those who after all will be <HI>Children of Wrath.</HI> The <HI>Pity,</HI> the <HI>Pity,</HI> in the Heart of the Blessed JESUS, for them, does move Him to <HI>Intercede</HI> for a <HI>Day of Patience</HI> to them. And then, for the <HI>Elect</HI> of GOD; The <HI>Day of Patience</HI> proves a <HI>Day of Salvation</HI> for them. Tis as we read, 2 Pet. III. 15. <HI>The Longsuffering of our Lord is Salvation.</HI> The Elect of GOD are for a while, and some of them for a long while, <HI>Bar∣ren Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> There must come a <HI>Year,</HI> wherein they shall Begin to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto GOD. With respect unto this <HI>Year,</HI> there is the <HI>Intercession</HI> of their SAVIOUR for them: <HI>Let them stand this Year also.</HI> A Sinner that by long <HI>Barrenness</HI> has exposed himself to <HI>Destruction,</HI> is by the <HI>Intercession</HI> of our SAVIOUR, preserved from it. The <HI>Inter∣cession</HI> by'nd by arrives to these Terms, <HI>This Year also!</HI> For, <HI>This Year,</HI> The <HI>Sinner</HI> will be <HI>converted from the Error of his way. This Year,</HI> the old Sinner will be a <HI>New Creature;</HI> will become a Servant of GOD, and a Blessing in the World. Therefore,
<PB N="179" REF="002905_0184_0FE6925A66EF0E68"/>Therefore it is, that the <HI>Tree</HI> stands, <HI>This Year al∣so.</HI> And the <HI>Charitative Intercession</HI> of them that wish well unto the <HI>Tree;</HI> the <HI>Charitative Intercession</HI> of some whose <HI>Effactual Fervent Prayers will avail much;</HI> the <HI>Charitative Intercession</HI> of Pastors, and of Parents, and of Godly Friends; This may also Contribute unto this <HI>Day of Patience.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Success</HI> of the <HI>Means</HI> used with the <HI>Unfruitful,</HI> while the <HI>Patience</HI> of GOD, is waiting <HI>One Year after another,</HI> to see <HI>Good Fruits</HI> upon them; This is <HI>Uncertain;</HI> To us, it is but <HI>Uncertain.</HI> Let the <HI>Barren Tree</HI> have <HI>One Year more,</HI> obtained for it, it is to us for the present not certain, whether <HI>it will bear Fruit,</HI> or whether <HI>Not.</HI> This <HI>Uncertainty</HI> indeed, is not with the Glorious GOD. For, <HI>The Lord knows who are His.</HI> He Infallibly <HI>Foreknows,</HI> how Men will be at the end of the Years. And His purposes are Unchangeable. But the <HI>Success</HI> of the Gospel, and of all the Labour used about a <HI>Barren Tree,</HI> it is with <HI>us,</HI> that it labours under an <HI>Uncertainty.</HI> When the Gospel comes any where, GOD sends it, because He has a People there. Some of His <HI>Elect</HI> are there. And as we read, Act. XIII. 48. <HI>As many as were ordained unto Eter∣nal Life, Believed.</HI> Thus; None of the <HI>Elect</HI> shall continue always in their <HI>Barrenness:</HI> A <HI>cutting down</HI> shall be none of their Portion. But then, There are <HI>Many Called,</HI> who are not <HI>Chosen.</HI> And because they live <HI>Both Together,</HI> the Gospel, with the Offers of a SAVIOUR, and the <HI>Means</HI> of coming to <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> are granted unto <HI>Both Together.</HI> In the mean time, Tis not for us to discern <HI>which is which.</HI> This is among
<PB N="180" REF="002905_0185_0FE692612C439E88"/>the <HI>Secret Things</HI> which <HI>belong unto the Lord.</HI> Men cannot convert unto GOD whom they please. The <HI>New Birth,</HI> is, J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. I. 13. <HI>Not of the Will of Man.</HI> The <HI>Success</HI> of the Gospel, depends on the <HI>Will of GOD;</HI> A Sovereign GOD, who <HI>will have Mercy on whom He will have Mercy.</HI> Is any <HI>Fruit</HI> ever found upon any Soul? <HI>From me is thy Fruit found, saith the Lord.</HI> Should there be so much as one <HI>Barren Tree</HI> among our Children, if it were in <HI>our power</HI> to convert them unto GOD? So much as one <HI>Barren Tree</HI> in this Assembly of <HI>Zion,</HI> if it were in <HI>our power</HI> to give <HI>Success</HI> unto our Minis∣try? <HI>Ah! Lord, If it were in our power, they should all bring forth Fruit unto thee!</HI> But, we must hold on endeavouring for the Conversion of all about us, <HI>Uncertain</HI> about the <HI>Success</HI> of our Endeavours. 'Tis uncertain to us, whether it will remain a <HI>Bar∣ren Tree,</HI> or no. It may be, <HI>Fruit</HI> may <HI>This Year</HI> begin to be found upon it. It may be, its <HI>Un∣fruitfulness</HI> may render it ripe for <HI>cutting down.</HI> We must hold on faithfully <HI>doing</HI> what we have to do; and commend unto GOD our <HI>Pains</HI> with our <HI>Prayers;</HI> leaving the <HI>Success</HI> of all with Him alone.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If before the <HI>Year</HI> of <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Proba∣tion</HI> expires, People become <HI>Fruitful</HI> unto GOD, <HI>It is well;</HI> All shall be <HI>well.</HI> The <HI>Barren Tree</HI> hav∣<HI>one Year more</HI> obtained for it, <HI>If it bear Fruit, it is well.</HI> Be sure, with the changed Sinner himself, it will be <HI>well.</HI> The <HI>Quickened</HI> Sinner becomes a <HI>Pardoned</HI> one. None of his former <HI>Unfruitfulness,</HI> nor of the <HI>Bad Fruits</HI> found upon him in his <HI>Un∣fruitful Days,</HI> will be charged upon him; He will
<PB N="181" REF="002905_0186_0FE692614C2F6A50"/>have the <HI>Pardon</HI> of them all! It shall be accor∣ding to That; Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k.

XII 1. <HI>O Lord, I will praise thee; For tho' thou wast angry with me, thine Anger is turned away, and thou dost Comfort me.</HI> The Glorious GOD in His <HI>Promises</HI> now <HI>speaks comfortably</HI> to him. The <HI>very treat and precious Promises</HI> in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD now belong unto him. All the Blessings purcha∣sed by the <HI>Blood of the Son of GOD</HI> now belong un∣to him. The <HI>Fruit</HI> which he brings forth unto GOD, what is it but a <HI>Fruit</HI> of the <HI>Everlasting Love</HI> in the Heart of the Glorious GOD unto him? In every <HI>Right Thing,</HI> which GOD enables the <HI>Fruit∣ful Soul</HI> to do for him, He says unto that Soul, <HI>Behold, A roof of my Everlasting Love unto thee; Behold, a Sign that I will have thee to stand one Day among the Plants of Righteousness in my Garden, by which I will be Glorified</HI> Yea, And it shall be <HI>well</HI> also for them who wished well unto the <HI>Tree;</HI> and especially to them who have done any thing for the <HI>Tree;</HI> When they see the <HI>Fruit</HI> which they have wished for. The <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD themselves, The <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD among whom there is <HI>Joy o∣ver a Sinner that Repenteth!</HI> Even those <HI>Birds of Paradise,</HI> will come and hover with Delight about the <HI>Fruitful Tree,</HI> and sit in the Boughs of it, and
<PB N="182" REF="002905_0187_0FE69262AC73BAF0"/><HI>Sing together,</HI> and <HI>Shout for Joy.</HI> My Friend, so <HI>well will</HI> it be, from the Moment of thy becoming <HI>Fruitful</HI> unto GOD.</P>
<P N="5">V. When the <HI>Year</HI> of <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Probation</HI> is expir'd, the <HI>Barren Tree</HI> no longer to be born with∣al, has a <HI>Destruction</HI> appoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for it: A <HI>Destructi∣on from GOD,</HI> which, O M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, should be a <HI>Terror</HI> to thee. If Now, <HI>it bear not Fruit, After That,</HI> a <HI>Cutting down</HI> shall be order'd for it.</P>
<P>You must be, first, warned of this; That the <HI>Barren Tree</HI> shall not be <HI>always born withal.</HI> The Glorious GOD will not <HI>always</HI> bear with it. The <HI>Patience</HI> of Heaven may stay a great while; But anon the <HI>Leaden Feet</HI> will come with <HI>Iron Hands.</HI> Of one, who had a <HI>space to Repent,</HI> and <HI>Repented not,</HI> we find anon it comes to That; Rev. II. 12. <HI>A great Tribulation. Barrenness</HI> under the Hus∣bandry of GOD; shall I say, 'Tis a <HI>Sin?</HI> Yea, 'tis a Complication of <HI>all Sins.</HI> And this un∣der the Aggravation of sinning against Instruc∣tion, against Conviction; of <HI>Rebelling against the Light.</HI> Can the Glorious GOD see a <HI>Disappoint∣ment</HI> of His <HI>Husbandry,</HI> without an Infinite <HI>Indig∣nation</HI> against it? A <HI>Fiery Indignation</HI> that shall <HI>devour a Tree</HI> so obnoxious unto Him? Ah! <HI>Bar∣ren Tree;</HI> What a Contempt all the while dost thou cast upon the <HI>Patience</HI> of God? Thus to <HI>De∣spise the Riches of His Goodness and Forbearance, and Long suffering!</HI> Thus to <HI>Turn His Grace into Wan∣tonness!</HI> GOD is greatly provoked at the Disho∣nour thus done unto Him. His <HI>Honour</HI> is in His <HI>Patience,</HI> how abominably, how unaccountably trampled on! He Resents the Disparagement. Yea, The <HI>Barren Tree</HI> will <HI>wax worse and worse.
<PB N="183" REF="002905_0188_0FE692A70BAA7EF8"/>Evil Men</HI> shall do so. They are the <HI>worse</HI> for the <HI>Patience</HI> of GOD. All tends to nourish and aug∣ment their <HI>Corruption.</HI> This adds to the <HI>Provoca∣tion.</HI> Anon, they grow <HI>Hopeless.</HI> Their Case is Desperate. They are Irrecoverable. To no purpose is any further <HI>Patience.</HI> To what purpose, <HI>one Year more?</HI> The <HI>Wrath of the Lord arises, and there is no Remedy.</HI> So, <HI>Abused Patience</HI> is turned into <HI>Fury.</HI> As a patient <HI>Creditor,</HI> long baffled, and bantered, and play'd upon, at length takes the Law upon the <HI>Debtor;</HI> becomes Inexorable: Thus the affronted <HI>Patience</HI> of GOD, will no longer divest the <HI>Law</HI> from taking its Course, on the <HI>Unfruitful Sinner.</HI> The Law is, <HI>Cut down the Barren Tree. O Unfruitful</HI> ones, Awake out of your security. <HI>GOD limits a certain Day, saying, To Day if you will hear His Voice.</HI> The <HI>Patience</HI> will come to an End, if your <HI>Barrenness</HI> don't come to an End. And, Oh! presume not, <HI>The Vision is for many Days to come.</HI> It may come to an End, sooner than you are aware of. It may come to an End, when you flatter yourselves, <HI>To Morrow shall be as this Day, and much more Abundant.</HI> It may come to an End, with such a Writ as that upon you, <HI>This Night thy Soul shall be required of thee.</HI> But, Oh! What will your Condition be, when the <HI>Day of Patience</HI> is come unto an End?</P>
<P>You must be, in the next place, warned of this; <HI>Destruction, Destruction</HI> comes, the <HI>Year</HI> of <HI>Destruction</HI> is come, on the <HI>Barren Tree,</HI> when the <HI>Patience</HI> of Heaven will not allow <HI>One Year more</HI> unto it.

III 19. <HI>Their End is Destruction</HI> The <HI>Barren Soul</HI> will find it self as much under the Aversion and Abhorrence of GOD, as a <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rren Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is to the Disappointed owner. <HI>How shall I Pardon thee?

<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>Methink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the very <HI>Day,</HI> may very agreeably invite you to Think upon them: The <HI>Intercession</HI> made a Year ago, <HI>Lord, Let it alone this Year also,</HI> has obtained it for us, That we are <HI>this Day</HI> en∣tring upon a <HI>New Year.</HI> I am not sure of obtain∣ing <HI>one Year more;</HI> or that, if the <HI>Fruit</HI> required from us, be brought forth any time within <HI>one Year more,</HI> it will be <HI>well;</HI> or that the <HI>Barren Tree,</HI> if it will persist obstinately so, shall not be <HI>Cut down</HI> before one Month of this <HI>Year</HI> be out. I will there∣fore insist upon some Lessons of PIETY, which on this very <HI>First Day of the Year,</HI> should be hear∣kened to. My Hearers, you run tremendous Hazards, if the Things be not <HI>Immediately</HI> hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken∣ed to. I am very sensible, That <HI>New-Years Day</HI> has too often been a Day of <HI>Paganizing Superstitions.</HI> I am also sensible, That it would be a Criminal Thing to alienate the <HI>Lords Day</HI> from the Intenti∣on of <HI>Sabbatizing</HI> to the Lord, in a Commemora∣tion
<PB N="186" REF="002905_0191_0FE6926AB84AA8E8"/>of our SAVIUUR's <HI>Resurrection from the Dead.</HI> And yet I will address you with some Lessons of PIETY, which will be but the more <HI>Beautiful</HI> for the <HI>Season</HI> in which I bring them to you. There shall be the more of Cogency and Pungency in them, for their coming unto you on a <HI>New Years Day.</HI> I will make as a Bright a <HI>Beginning of the Year</HI> for you as I can; and as one who <HI>knows not what</HI> a Year, no, nor what a <HI>Day may bring forth.</HI></P>
<P>First, O Be very Thankful, very Thankful, for This, that you have had <HI>one Year more,</HI> added unto the many <HI>Years,</HI> wherein the Glorious GOD has come <HI>looking fur Fruit</HI> upon you. How Thank∣fully may you <HI>this Day</HI> say, as in Act. XXVI. 22. <HI>Having obtained Help from GOD, I continue to this Day. This Day</HI> Consider, <HI>How many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars have I seen, since I came into the World.</HI> Consider, <HI>How many Younger than I, have been laid in the Grave, since I came into the World?</HI> Consider, <HI>How often have I been very near unto Death my self since I came into the World?</HI> Add this Consideration; <HI>How much have I provoked an Holy and Righteous GOD by my Unfruitfulness, to have cut me down, many, many Years ago?</HI> Then fall down before the Lord, with all possible <HI>Thankfulness.</HI> Yea, with surprized and a∣mazed Souls, and even swallowed up with Admi∣ration at it, Cry out, <HI>O my GOD, I am astonished at thy Patience! Oh, Let me make a Right use of it! Oh! Let it be found, that thou in Love to my Soul hast kept me so many Years from going down into the Pit of Cor∣ruption.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Confess it, Bewail it, that the Glori∣ous GOD should so many <HI>Years</HI> come <HI>looking for Fruit,</HI> and find so little of what he has looked for;
<PB N="187" REF="002905_0192_0FE6926AD836CAA0"/>and seek and get the <HI>Pardon</HI> of it. Oh! Let it not be said <HI>This Day,</HI> as in Jer. VIII. 6. <HI>I hearkened and heard; No Man Repented, saying, What have I done? This Day</HI> examine your selves. You will upon Examination find, That you have brought forth little of that <HI>Fruit</HI> which you should have had. You will find, That very much evil <HI>Fruit</HI> has been found upon you. Oh! The <HI>Humiliations</HI> which you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by your <HI>Unfruitfulness</HI> call'd unto! Cry out, <HI>Lord, I abhor my self, and I Repent in Dust and Ashes!</HI> Cry out, <HI>Lord, such a Barren Tree de∣serves to be turned into Dust and Ashes.</HI> Weep to the Lord for the Pardon of this <HI>Unfruitfulness.</HI> Plead the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the <HI>Fruitful</HI> JESUS, who yet was <HI>Cut off.</HI> Let This be your only Plea for your <HI>Par∣don.</HI> The <HI>Cross</HI> is to be pleaded, that the <HI>Barren Tree</HI> may be <HI>pardoned.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. That you may be <HI>spared this Year also,</HI> yea, as not knowing whether you shall be so, or no, Begin the <HI>Year</HI> with such <HI>Dispositions,</HI> and such <HI>Resolutions,</HI> that some <HI>Good Fruit</HI> may even <HI>This Day</HI> be found upon you. Your <HI>Good Fruit</HI> must not be put off, as what may <HI>one Year more</HI> be staid for. I do vehemently <HI>This Day</HI> press for such Things as these.</P>
<P>First; O all you Unconverted ones, <HI>This Day, This Day,</HI> Turn to GOD; and Resign yourselves up to the Conduct of your SAVIOUR. Too long, Ah, too long, O miserable ones, you have been under the Condemnation of a <HI>Total Barren∣ness.</HI> 'Tis high Time for you, to come unto That; Psal. CXIX. 59, 60. <HI>I thought on my Ways, and I turned my Feet unto thy Testimonies. I made Haste and I delay'd not to keep thy Commandments.</HI> Oh!
<PB N="188" REF="002905_0193_0FE6926BFA06E778"/><HI>Make Haste,</HI> and Think not of <HI>Delaying</HI> your Turn to GOD, for <HI>one Year more.</HI> 'Tis enjoined upon you, <HI>Immediately</HI> to give up your selves unto GOD, with <HI>Sorrows</HI> for your Wandring after <HI>Idols,</HI> and with <HI>Desires</HI> that you may <HI>not offend any more. Im∣mediately</HI> Receive your SAVIOUR in all His <HI>Offi∣ces,</HI> with all His <HI>Benefits. Immediately</HI> Resolve up∣on a Life of PIETY; and say, <HI>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. If any of you are Conscious, of your having hitherto omitted any thing that should have been some of the <HI>Good Fruit</HI> upon you, <HI>This Day</HI> put yourselves into a way that the <HI>Year</HI> may not roll on much further, before you are come unto it. Of This <HI>Good Fruit,</HI> let that Complaint be heard no longer; Jer. XIII. 27. <HI>When shall it once be?</HI> This I press on those, that have not yet set up the <HI>Worship</HI> of GOD in their <HI>Families.</HI> And this I press on those who have not yet come into the sacred Fellowship at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. Yea, I urge for This; That we do every one of us <HI>This Day,</HI> study somewhat upon that Question; <HI>In what points may I become yet more Fruitful unto GOD?</HI> Indeed I can tell no better way to be <HI>spared this Year also.</HI> It has been an old saying; <HI>Fructus Liberat Arborem.</HI> If the <HI>Tree</HI> would <HI>stand,</HI> let it <HI>bear.</HI> O <HI>Bearing Tree,</HI> If thou fall <HI>This Year,</HI> it shall be only to Translate thee into the <HI>Eden</HI> that is above.</P>
<P>There are Two or Three Meditations, which I intreat you in the Evening of <HI>This Day,</HI> to give some Entertainment to. <HI>Muse, till the Fire burns.</HI></P>
<P>First, Think This; <HI>Who knows, which are the Trees among us, that are to be cut down this Year?</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="002905_0194_0FE6926C21F9E040"/>It was of old said unto one; Jer. XXVIII. 16. <HI>This Year shalt thou die.</HI> Doubtless, There are some in the Auditory, who are <HI>This Year to die.</HI> Every Year it has been so. And, <HI>Lord, Is it I?</HI> So may every one say. No one knows, whose Lot it will be; whether it mayn't be <HI>his own, To die this Year.</HI></P>
<P>Again; Think This; <HI>If I am cut down before I begin to bring forth Fruit unto GOD, what will be∣come of me?</HI> Tis a terrible Word; Matth. VII. 19. <HI>Every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewn down, and cast into the Fire.</HI> O Tremble, Tremble, at the View of the Formidable <HI>Fire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Look down into the <HI>Devouring Fire, and the Even∣lasting Burnings!</HI> and say, <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my Soul!</HI></P>
<P>Finally; Think This; <HI>Tho' I should not be cut down, yet if I do not bring forth good Fruit, I may be as bad as cut down.</HI> I will fay unto you, what will be <HI>as Bad! As Bad</HI> as a <HI>cutting down</HI> will be that Sentence from the Mouth of GOD; Matth. XXI. 19. <HI>Let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.</HI> To be <HI>Judicially</HI> given up unto Eternal Blindness, and Hardness, and Ungodliness; O! Tis a fear∣ful Thing. Beware, Beware, lest this come up∣on you. Deprecate it wonderfully.</P>
<P>And now Retire; If you presently <HI>bring forth Fruit,</HI> Even, <HI>This Day;</HI> for a <HI>To Morrow</HI> must not be talk'd of; <HI>Tis well!</HI> But, <HI>if not,</HI>— Then <HI>Af∣ter That!</HI>—who can say, what is to follow? Oh! Consider of it.</P>
<P>I have done. I know not what sort of a <HI>New Year</HI> others may wish you. But I wish you a <HI>Pious New Year;</HI> A <HI>New Year</HI> filled with the <HI>Fruits</HI> of
<PB N="190" REF="002905_0195_0FE69272B39926F8"/>PIETY; <HI>Full of Goodness,</HI> and filled with all the <HI>Blessings of Goodness.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Gaudentius. The Joyful HARVEST.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Gal. VI. 9.</BIBL>
<P><HI>In due Season we shall Reap, if we Faint not.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Joy of Harvest</HI> is now before us! Here is an <HI>Husbandry,</HI> that never will, never can, miss of a Glorious <HI>Harvest!</HI> The <HI>Husbandry</HI> pro∣secuted in the Fields of <HI>Nature,</HI> often misses of the <HI>Harvest</HI> expected by the <HI>Husbandman.</HI> Our Apo∣stasy from GOD, has brought a <HI>Curse</HI> upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> and a <HI>Failing</HI> of the <HI>Harvest</HI> which we have Laboured for. After much <HI>Labour,</HI> the Issue often is That; Joel I. 11, 12. <HI>Be ye ashamed, O ye Hus∣bandmen; Because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Harvest of the Field is perished. Joy is withered away from the Sons of Men.</HI> But in the <HI>Husbandry</HI> of PIETY, a Blessed and a Joyful <HI>Harvest</HI> is never missed of. We are advssed from Heaven of it; It shall have a <HI>Sure Reward.</HI> The <HI>Reward</HI> of PIETY is the <HI>Harvest</HI> of it. Of this, the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has here given us this Assurance; <HI>Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due season we shall Reap, if we faint not.</HI> It seems,
<PB N="193" REF="002905_0198_0FE6927444CD3B98"/>The <HI>Work</HI> of PIETY may not be without its <HI>Wearisome Difficulties:</HI> Things which our <HI>Carnal Minds</HI> may dispose us to be too soon weary of. But, Hold on, Hold out, O <HI>Unwearied</HI> PIETY. There will be an <HI>Harvest,</HI> wherein thou shalt <HI>Reap,</HI> what will be a <HI>Great Reward,</HI> yea, a <HI>Full Reward</HI> of all: The Oracles of our GOD have expresly called it so. But it is a <HI>Season</HI> that must be waited for.</P>
<P>Our Apostle is exhorting of the Faithful to shake off, yea, <HI>cut off.</HI> (with a just <HI>Excommunica∣tion</HI>) the <HI>False Teachers</HI> from whom they suffered more than a little <HI>Trouble.</HI> But at the same time, he exhorts them to advance a <HI>Liberal Maintainance</HI> for the Orthodox, Diligent, Vigilant <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel. He would have them to beware, lest they <HI>mocked GOD</HI> in their <HI>Parsimony</HI> on this Occa∣sion; but asserts unto them, that their <HI>Liberality</HI> in this Matter, would not fail of a <HI>Recompence.</HI> There would be a Desireable <HI>Harvest</HI> of it. But it is asserted in such Terms, as to extend unto the whole Work of PIETY. And now, having that Commission; Isa. III. 10. <HI>Say ye to the Righteous, that it shall be well; For they shall eat the Fruit of their Doings:</HI> I will now <HI>execute</HI> it, <HI>saying</HI> what I am thus led unto. What I have to say, is in this <HI>Admonition</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>Difficulties</HI> the Work of PIETY may be encumbred withal, yet, <HI>Thy Work shall be Rewarded, saith the Lord:</HI> There will be a <HI>Joyful Harvest</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The Work of PIETY is, that <HI>Whole Duty of Man,</HI> which has been summ'd up in that Wedge
<PB N="194" REF="002905_0199_0FE648E839A94E88"/>of Gold; Eccl. XII. 13. <HI>Fear GOD, and keep H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commandments;</HI> A Mass of Gold, capable of being Beaten out, into how large Dimensions! <HI>Exceed∣ing Broad.</HI></P>
<P>Of this <HI>Work,</HI> it is ordered by the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of a Sovereign GOD, that it shall be attended with <HI>Difficulties;</HI> even such as may render a <HI>Toilsome Husbandry</HI> a Resemblance of it. That which cre∣ates the <HI>Difficulties</HI> of this Work, is principally the <HI>Self-denial,</HI> which our <HI>Carnal Mind,</HI> makes neces∣sary to be exercised, in our doing of it. Our <HI>Flesh</HI> must be cross'd, and our <HI>Appetites</HI> must be morti∣fied; yea, there are <HI>Enemies</HI> to be Encountred, that are not easily to be Conquered; or else the Work of PIETY can't be carried on.</P>
<P>But, GOD will <HI>not forget this Work and Labour of Love.</HI> O PATIENCE, Do thou persist, even to <HI>Long-suffering,</HI> in the work of PIETY; There will be a <HI>Joyful Harvest</HI> of it. Things must pro∣ceed according unto that Word; Jam. V. 7. <HI>Be Patient, Brethren;— Behold, The Husbandman waiteth for the precious Fruits of the Earth, and hath long Patience for it, until he receive the Early and Lat∣ter Rain. Be ye also Patient.</HI> —</P>
<P>We have Two Enquiries before us. The first is, <HI>What will be the Harvest of PIETY? What the Reward that shall be Reap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of it?</HI> The second is; <HI>When will be the due Season for it? When the Reaping Time?</HI> The Answer to both Enquiries, may best join them together. And it shall be given in Two Propositions. In general, We are taught, 1. Tim. IV. 8. <HI>Godliness has the Promise both of the Life which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w is, and of that which is to come.</HI> In this <HI>Promise,</HI> there is laid up the <HI>Harvest</HI> of <HI>Godliness;</HI> and what
<PB N="195" REF="002905_0200_0FE6492593FF5E98"/>shall in the <HI>due Season</HI> be <HI>Reaped</HI> of it. More par∣ticularly.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>The first Proposition.</HEAD>
<P>Even in <HI>this present Life, Laborious</HI> PIETY will see some <HI>Good Reward of its Labour:</HI> In the midst of the <HI>Sufferings of this present Time,</HI> we shall <HI>Reap</HI> some <HI>Harvest</HI> of our PIETY! Before we Dy, we may see some <HI>First Fruits;</HI> and our PIETY may have some <HI>Consequences,</HI> which may be some <HI>Com∣pensations</HI> to us, for all the <HI>Difficulties</HI> which have distressed it. In the Work of PIETY we may have those things done for us, which may be a sort of <HI>Roasting Ears</HI> to entertain us, by way of <HI>Earnest</HI> and <HI>Essay,</HI> towards the Fulfilment of that Word; Eph. VI. 8 <HI>Whatsoever Good Thing any Man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord.</HI> More particu∣larly.</P>
<P>First. If we lose any <HI>Temporal Enjoyments,</HI> in and for the work of PIETY, we shall even in This World, <HI>Reap</HI> an <HI>Harvest</HI> of <HI>Spiritual Enjoy∣ments,</HI> wherein our Work will be <HI>Well-Rewarded.</HI> The <HI>Spiritual Enjoyments,</HI> of a Soul improving in PIETY; <HI>growing in the Grace and Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</HI> JESUS CHRIST; having the <HI>Unsearchable Riches of CHRIST,</HI> more sensibly com∣municated unto it; The <HI>Spiritual Enjoyments</HI> of GOD bringing Home His <HI>Electing,</HI> and <HI>Redeeming,</HI> and <HI>Pardoning Love,</HI> in the precious Tokens there∣of unto the Soul; The <HI>Spiritual Enjoyments</HI> of a SAVIOUR saying to the Soul, <HI>I am thy Salvation:</HI> These will be enough to make a <HI>Rich Amends,</HI> for all that can be undergone in the Work of PIETY. Soul, Thou are <HI>yet in thy Sins,</HI> if thou art not per∣swaded
<PB N="196" REF="002905_0201_0FE6475FB5E103B8"/>so; Yet Unregenerate, if these Things, are not better to thee, than the <HI>Merchandise of Sil∣ver, and the Gain of the finest Gold!</HI> Now, Hearken to some <HI>Remarkable</HI> Things.</P>
<P>It is observable; The People of GOD are put unto Considerable <HI>Expenses,</HI> that the <HI>Ordinances of Heaven</HI> may be supported in the Churches of the Lord. In these <HI>Expences</HI> there is, what our Inspir∣ed Apostle here calls, <HI>A sowing to the Spirit.</HI> There follows, <HI>Of the Spirit a Reaping of Life Everlasting.</HI> This will be some <HI>Harvest</HI> of it. The <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Godly Man, who is <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Bountiful</HI> in these <HI>Expenses,</HI> will be most likely to profit under the <HI>Means of Grace;</HI> most likely to flourish with such <HI>Fruits of the Spirit,</HI> as will bring on <HI>Everlasting Life.</HI> The Good of the <HI>Word;</HI> verily, 'Tis more to be valued than the Good of the <HI>World.</HI> GOD will bless thee with a <HI>Profitable Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>An Observation akin to This, may be made; The more <HI>Pains</HI> any Take, and the more <HI>Travel</HI> or <HI>Hardship,</HI> they pass through, that they may wait upon GOD in His Institutions; The more does our Gracious GOD often grant unto such Devout Souls, of <HI>Communion</HI> with Himself in them. They are well-paid for their <HI>Pains,</HI> in what of GOD they meet withal. There will be an Immediate <HI>Harvest!</HI> The <HI>Rain</HI> with which they have been Weather beaten, is requited in the <HI>Rain</HI> of the Heavenly <HI>Doctrine,</HI> falling sweetly on their Souls. The <HI>Cold</HI> which has pinched them, is requited in the <HI>Heavenly Warmth,</HI> with which they find their Souls invigorated. Or, If they leave any <HI>Pleasant Company,</HI> for the sake of secret Interviews with Heaven, they meet with such <HI>Pleasures</HI> in the
<PB N="197" REF="002905_0202_0FE6476D29095348"/>Company of GOD, that they can testify, <HI>An Hour in the Closet is better than a thousand elsewhere.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover; Christian, under Afflictions from the Hand of GOD, <HI>Let Patience have its perfect Work.</HI> There will be this <HI>Harvest</HI> of it; The <HI>Consolations of GOD,</HI> which are <HI>not small,</HI> shall fill <HI>thy</HI> Contented Mind. With much <HI>Submission</HI> bear the Death of thy <HI>Off-spring;</HI> Thy GOD will have this <HI>Mourners Cordial</HI> ready for thee; <HI>I give my Son unto thee! Thou art one of my Children! It is now known that thou fearest GOD!</HI> With much Submis∣sion bear the Spoil of thy <HI>Estate;</HI> Thy GOD will revive thee, with such an invaluable Recruit as this; <HI>I have laid up for thee a Portion which no Spoil∣er can meddle withal.</HI> Submit cheerfully to Bodily <HI>Sicknesses</HI> and <HI>Illnesses;</HI> Thou shalt have in the <HI>Health of thy Soul,</HI> that which will make it up.</P>
<P>Again; Under <HI>Injuries</HI> from the Hand of Man; Take no <HI>Personal Revenge;</HI> Be <HI>Full of Goodness;</HI> and even <HI>overcome Evil with Good:</HI> Seek not that which <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> may call <HI>Satisfaction.</HI> There will be this <HI>Harvest</HI> of it. Upon thy readily <HI>For∣giving</HI> the <HI>Wrongs</HI> which others have done unto thee, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sealing</HI> SPIRIT of GOD will power∣fully say unto thee, <HI>Be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</HI> The <HI>Tranquility</HI> of Soul, which thou shalt enjoy in the sense of thy own <HI>Pardon</HI> from GOD, while thou dost generously <HI>Pardon</HI> the Worm that has wronged thee; This, This will be the truest <HI>Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; A Furious and Fiery Assault of <HI>Temp∣tations,</HI> 'tis no easy thing to Resist it. To gratify a <HI>Temptation,</HI> appears the most agreeable thing in the World unto a Man, who has the <HI>Blinding
<PB N="198" REF="002905_0203_0FE6476D414E2AE0"/>Force</HI> of it upon him. There is no little <HI>Difficulty,</HI> in saying, <HI>How shall I do this Wickedness, and Sin a∣gainst GOD?</HI> But now, the <HI>Harvest</HI> will be this. There is a marvellous <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> of Soul, wherewith a <HI>Victory</HI> over <HI>Temptation</HI> uses to be ac∣companied. O <HI>Blessed Overcomer,</HI> thou shalt find a thousand times more Delight in <HI>Conquering</HI> of a Temptation, than thou couldest have had in <HI>Con∣senting</HI> to it. Thus is there accomplished, that Word concerning the <HI>Maxims</HI> of PIETY; Psal. XIX. 11. <HI>In keeping them there is great Reward.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, Secondly; The Work of PIETY may <HI>Reap</HI> some <HI>Harvest,</HI> even in the <HI>Temporal Enjoy∣ments</HI> of this World. In the Work of PIETY, we are called often to part with such Things, as ap∣pear, and we count <HI>our Interest:</HI> But the Work is often <HI>Rewarded</HI> in those very Things. Our GOD will not suffer us to be <HI>Losers,</HI> in <HI>those very Points</HI> wherein we offer to be so.</P>
<P>Another Catalogue of <HI>Remarkable Things,</HI> is now to be hearken'd to.</P>
<P>Behold, The <HI>Harvest!</HI> O <HI>Well-doer, Trust</HI> thy GOD in the way of <HI>Well-doing:</HI> Thou shalt be no <HI>loser</HI> by thy <HI>Trust in GOD.</HI> A wondrous Thing fell out, in the Land of <HI>Israel!</HI> The <HI>Israelites</HI> must go up <HI>Thrice</HI> a Year unto the <HI>stated Festivals.</HI> They ran a great <HI>Venture</HI> in what they did. They left their <HI>Families</HI> exposed unto the Enemies that sur∣rounded them. Who should now protect their <HI>Families?</HI> They had a Glorious Protector. GOD undertook their Protection; and said, Exod. XXXIV. 24. <HI>No Man shall desire thy Land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy GOD.</HI> They were to <HI>Trust</HI> GOD with all they had; and
<PB N="199" REF="002905_0204_0FE6476EB4AE2908"/>GOD <HI>kept</HI> all they had. When we have plain <HI>Duty</HI> lying before us, let us do our <HI>Duty,</HI> and let us <HI>trust</HI> GOD with the <HI>Event</HI> of it. The <HI>Event</HI> will be far better than if we had <HI>shunn'd</HI> the <HI>Duty,</HI> because we <HI>fear'd</HI> the <HI>Event.</HI> The <HI>GOD of Truth</HI> loves to be <HI>relied</HI> upon. We never fare so well, as in the way of <HI>Reliance</HI> upon GOD. The <HI>Faith∣ful Reprover</HI> afterwards finds more <HI>Favour</HI> than the <HI>Fawning Flatterer.</HI> Sacrifice thy <HI>Friends,</HI> O Man of GOD, in thy <HI>Testimonies</HI> against Miscarriages. GOD will multiply thy <HI>Friends.</HI> It may be, He will make the Rebuked and Censured <HI>Offenders</HI> themselves to become thy <HI>Friends.</HI> Eminent <HI>Con∣fessors</HI> of the Lord, often run desperate Risques in and for their brave <HI>Confessions.</HI> But how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trangely have the <HI>Witnesses</HI> of GOD been often provided for! Turned out of their Livings, the <HI>Sixth</HI> Chap∣ter of <HI>Matthew</HI> has made Provision for them; They have lived upon it.</P>
<P>Behold, The <HI>Harvest!</HI> Be very <HI>Bountiful,</HI> O thou <HI>Deviser of Good,</HI> in thy Oblations for <HI>Pious Uses;</HI> Thou shalt lose nothing, but be Enriched by thy <HI>Bounties.</HI> To <HI>lay out</HI> will be to <HI>lay up.</HI> What a <HI>Judas</HI> calls, <HI>A Waste,</HI> thou shalt find far from so. We are so instructed; Eccl. XI. 1. <HI>Cast thy Bread-Corn on the moist Ground; for thou shalt find it after many Days;</HI> Or, In a multitude of Days. For, <HI>Blessed is he that considers the Poor, the Lord spall preserve him, and keep him alive.</HI> No <HI>Usury</HI> com∣parable to that of <HI>Lending to the Lord.</HI> GOD <HI>Re∣pays</HI> them who do it, with unaccountable <HI>Additions</HI> to their Possessions. While Men <HI>do Good</HI> and <HI>Com∣municate,</HI> they find, that they <HI>Scatter</HI> and yet <HI>In∣crease.</HI> They find that while they <HI>Honour the Lord
<PB N="200" REF="002905_0205_0FE647A956ABECB0"/>with their Substance,</HI> their <HI>Barns are filled with Plen∣ty.</HI> O Atheistical <HI>Pharisees, Deride</HI> not these <HI>Faith∣ful Sayings</HI> of GOD!</P>
<P>Behold, The <HI>Harvest!</HI> With much <HI>Long-suffer∣ing</HI> put up and pass by <HI>Abuses,</HI> O Servant of the Lord; Thou shalt suffer no <HI>Loss,</HI> but be very much a <HI>Gainer,</HI> by thy <HI>Long-Suffering.</HI> We read, 2 Tim. II. 24. <HI>The Servant of the Lord must not strive, but be Gentle unto all Men, Patient.</HI> The less any Man <HI>strives</HI> for himself, the more the Great GOD will do for him. Let one that apprehends himself much Abused, keep down angry Resent∣ments of the Abuses; and only set himself to get as much <HI>Good</HI> as he can by the <HI>Evil</HI> that is intend∣ed him, and the <HI>Indignities</HI> wherewith he is insul∣ted, and study all possible Conformity to a Lovely JESUS, who <HI>when He was Reviled, Reviled not a∣gain; but committed His Cause to Him who judges Righteously.</HI> One would imagine, a Man should get but little, by such a <HI>Lamblike Tameness.</HI> No; But GOD will espouse his Cause; GOD will find a Time to <HI>bring forth his Righteousness as the Light.</HI> GOD will at some time or other, <HI>show him a Token for Good,</HI> that <HI>they which hate him shall see and be ashamed.</HI> Our SAVIOUR said unto His <HI>Philadelphian</HI> Servant, <HI>I will make them to know that I have loved thee.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, The <HI>Harvest!</HI> Carry it well in thy se∣veral <HI>Relations,</HI> O Child of GOD; Thy <HI>Good Car∣riage</HI> is what thou wilt be no loser by. We read, 1 Pet. II. 19. <HI>This is Thank-worthy;</HI> GOD will <HI>Bless</HI> you for it: And anon, <HI>Men</HI> will also <HI>Thank</HI> you. We are not <HI>Really Good,</HI> if we are not <HI>Rela∣tively Good.</HI> But they who <HI>Deal well</HI> with their
<PB N="201" REF="002905_0206_0FE648EB265C1568"/>several <HI>Relatives</HI> GOD often causes others to <HI>Deal well</HI> with them. Especially, <HI>Children, Honour your Parents.</HI> A Conspicuous <HI>Recompence</HI> is very com∣monly dispensed, unto those who treat their <HI>Pa∣rents</HI> as they ought to do; and <HI>help</HI> them with a due Alacrity, when it shall be called for. The <HI>Jews</HI> have a Saying, <HI>An Aged Mother is a Mine of Gold in a Family.</HI> Let none that would be own'd <HI>Christians,</HI> imagine otherwise. But in all <HI>Relati∣ons</HI> whatsoever; Suppose any should not carry it well to <HI>us,</HI> yet let us carry it well to <HI>Them;</HI> As a <HI>Paul</HI> did unto a People that very much mal-treat∣ed him. O thou <HI>Follower of the Good One;</HI> Thou shalt find the <HI>GOD of Patience,</HI> to be the <HI>GOD of Consolation.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, The <HI>Harvest!</HI> O <HI>Candid</HI> Soul, Don't <HI>Repine,</HI> but <HI>Rejoice,</HI> at the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of other Peo∣ple: Thou shalt be no loser by thy <HI>Candour.</HI> We read, Jam. IV. 5. <HI>The Spirit who dwells in us, vehemently wishes against Envy.</HI> They who from the Dispositions of the Holy SPIRIT in them, keep under their <HI>Envy</HI> at the Mercy of GOD unto other Men, &amp; are full of <HI>Good Wishes</HI> to them, find GOD showing of <HI>Mercy</HI> unto them, it may be, more than unto other Men. Their <HI>Good Wishes</HI> do return into their own <HI>Bosoms</HI> at the last. Be Glad, when thou seest thy Neighbour <HI>Prosperous.</HI> This Ingenuity will make all the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of thy Neighbour to become <HI>Thy own.</HI> It will also be∣speak an Accession to thy own <HI>Prosperity.</HI> GOD will say; <HI>Art thou glad of my Goodness to thy Neigh∣bour? Thou shalt have more cause of Gladness: I will be as Good unto thee, as ever I have been unto thy Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="002905_0207_0FE648EB46BAFA08"/>
As an Appendix to This; Take pleasure in <HI>Speaking well</HI> of other People. With pleasure lay hold on all Opportunities, to Mention and cele∣brate what is <HI>Laudable</HI> in them. See whether it now does not fall out unto thee, according to that Word; <HI>With what Measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you again.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, The <HI>Harvest!</HI> Be willing to ly <HI>Low,</HI> lay thy self <HI>Low,</HI> O <HI>Humble</HI> Soul; Thou shalt be no loser by thy <HI>Humility.</HI> Oh! The charming Invitation to <HI>Lowliness!</HI> Luk. XVIII. 14. <HI>He that Humbleth himself shall be Exalted.</HI> So then, Let us ly much in the <HI>Dust</HI> before the Lord. Let us do all we can to <HI>Glorifie GOD;</HI> But let us be willing to be <HI>Little,</HI> to be <HI>Nothing</HI> after all. Be even afraid, left Men do unduly <HI>Magnify</HI> us, and render unto us the Respect which is due to GOD alone. Be not at all Disturbed, tho' never so much <HI>Despised and Rejected of Men.</HI> I dare not <HI>Say,</HI> and we should hardly care to <HI>Think,</HI> what will be the Issue of Continual, Real, Sincere <HI>Self-Annihilation.</HI> It may too much interfere with the proposed <HI>Self-An∣nihilation!</HI> But <HI>This</HI> may be told; <HI>Before Honour is Humility. Self-Abasement, Self-Abasement,</HI> is the way to be made, how <HI>serviceable.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, the <HI>Harvest!</HI> Under all <HI>Adversity</HI> be full of <HI>Resignation,</HI> O Thou <HI>Afflicted, and tossed with Tempest:</HI> Thou shalt lose Nothing by thy <HI>Resign∣ing</HI> of every thing. To <HI>Resign</HI> every thing is the Best way, to <HI>Preserve</HI> what we have, or to <HI>Restore</HI> what is taken away. One who had lost many <HI>Ta∣lents</HI> of Silver, and <HI>Order</HI> given him to bear it qui∣etly; had that <HI>comfort</HI> came with the Order; 2. Chron. XXV. 9. <HI>The Lord is able to give thee much
<PB N="203" REF="002905_0208_0FE648F00C7FD440"/>more than This.</HI> When there is any thing taken from thee, compose thy Mind, and say, <HI>Lord, I will not open my Mouth, because thou dost it.</HI> Who can tell, but the Lord may <HI>Give thee much more than all</HI> that is taken? My Friend, If one Loss come upon thee after another, sit down before the Lord, and let the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD give Law to Thine: and say, <HI>The Lord hath given; the Lord hath taken away; Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> I can tell of one who did so: And I can tell how it ended. <HI>The Lord blessed the latter End of Job more than his Begin∣ning.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; Behold, the <HI>Harvest!</HI> Be first and most concerned for <HI>Spiritual Blessings,</HI> O <HI>Spiritually∣minded</HI> one; Thou shalt be the more secure of <HI>Temporal Blessings.</HI> Thou hast the never-failing Word of thy SAVIOUR for it: Mat. VI. 33. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of GOD, and His Righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</HI> Be most solli∣citous in thy <HI>Labour</HI> for the <HI>Eternal Food</HI> that thy Soul may not <HI>Perish;</HI> 'Tis the way to make sure also of the <HI>Meat that perishes. First</HI> and <HI>Most</HI> seek a Cure for the <HI>Maladies</HI> of thy Soul: 'Twill ope∣rate well towards the Cure of thy <HI>Bodily Maladies.</HI> Be most sollicitous to be <HI>at Peace</HI> with Heaven; so thy <HI>Enemies</HI> will be <HI>at Peace</HI> with thee. Let the <HI>Lords-day</HI> be entirely devoted unto the Lord; Things will go on the better all the <HI>Week ensuing.</HI> Let the Lord have the <HI>Morning</HI> of every day; All Things will go the better for it <HI>all the day.</HI> There will be smiles of GOD upon you, O you <HI>Diligent seekers of GOD,</HI> wherein you will find him a <HI>Rewar∣der: Smiles</HI> which you will wonder at, and say up∣on them; <HI>This I have had, O Lord, because I have kept thy Precepts!</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Second Proposition.</HEAD>
<P>'Twill be in the <HI>Life to come,</HI> that <HI>Laborious</HI> PIE∣TY will receive its <HI>Full Recompence of Reward:</HI> In our Arrival to THAT will be the <HI>Due Season,</HI> for the <HI>Reaping</HI> that is to <HI>Reward</HI> our <HI>Labour;</HI> In <HI>a∣nother World,</HI> our PIETY will <HI>Reap</HI> an <HI>Harvest,</HI> which <HI>Eye has not seen, Ear has not heard, nor has it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive.</HI> After <HI>Death</HI> we shall find such an <HI>Harvest,</HI> as will Abundantly Infinitely, Eternally, Compensate for all the <HI>Diffi∣culties</HI> of the preceeding <HI>Husbandry.</HI> Yea, O Be∣leever.

<PB N="205" REF="002905_0210_0FE647AD3AA55DE0"/>he does bring back his Sheaves.</HI> The Christian hav∣ing done the part, not only of a <HI>Working</HI> but also of a <HI>Weeping Husbandman,</HI> in a Life of PIETY, shall anon see a plenteous, yea, a <HI>Joyful Harvest,</HI> of all his pious Obedience. But <HI>when,</HI> when will be the <HI>Harvest?</HI> It is answered, Mat. XIII. 39. <HI>The Har∣vest is the End of the World.</HI> Indeed, we shall have some <HI>Hansel</HI> of our <HI>Harvest,</HI> in what shall be done for our <HI>Spirits</HI> at their Departure from our <HI>Bodies;</HI> which will be to us, in some sort, <HI>the End of the World.</HI> Our <HI>Spirits</HI> will at our Expiration, be <HI>com∣forted</HI> in the <HI>Paradise</HI> of GOD: So <HI>comforted,</HI> as to be <HI>Well-Rewarded,</HI> if we should <HI>Reap</HI> no more of all our <HI>Labour</HI> in the <HI>Husbandry</HI> of PIETY.

<PB N="206" REF="002905_0211_0FE648F0228E0DD8"/>Thou shalt thy self be thrown under the <HI>Clods of the Valley;</HI> thrown without a <HI>Metaphor,</HI> even where thou hast thrown the <HI>Seed</HI> of thy Expecta∣tion.

<P>Our <HI>Judgment</HI> of PIETY! Surely, we must not Judge of some things in it, from the <HI>present Aspect</HI> of them. The <HI>Work</HI> of PIETY has in it, the <HI>Toil</HI> of <HI>Husbandry;</HI> Yea, such Things as may bring us into the Hazard of being <HI>Weary of well do∣ing.</HI> But now, Judge of Things from the <HI>Harvest</HI> of them. He that sees only the <HI>Toil</HI> of the <HI>Hus∣bandman,</HI> sees what looks very Discouraging.

It looks very Disconsolately! Well; But <HI>wait</HI> a while. Some while hence you will see this poor Man enriched with a <HI>Joyful Harvest.</HI> The <HI>Appointed Weeks of Harvest</HI> are coming on. These <HI>Fill his Barns.</HI> Then!

XXVI. 10. <HI>He was a lover of Husbandry.</HI> Yea, the Subject of <HI>Husbandry</HI> has been adorned, if I am not misinformed, by the Writings and Labours of more than <HI>Twenty Kings.</HI> But here is that more Noble <HI>Husbandry,</HI> which the Glorious KING of Heaven will with Delight look down upon: And an <HI>Husbandry,</HI> which it would be no Diminution for <HI>Kings</HI> to be <HI>served</HI> from. Such <HI>Husbandry</HI> will somewhat praelibate and emulate the Tillage of that <HI>Paradise</HI> wherein the Saints that shall be <HI>caught up to meet the Lord,</HI> that they may escape the Flames of the Burning World, shall afterwards come down <HI>changed</HI> and <HI>sinless,</HI> and in a <HI>New Earth wherein shall dwell Righteousness,</HI> they shall <HI>plant Fields,</HI> and <HI>eat the Fruit of them;</HI> and the <HI>Blessed Ones</HI> who <HI>see GOD,</HI> shall also <HI>Inherit the Earth.</HI></P>

<P>READER, It was proposed, that this Book might have been rendred a yet more Compleat FAMILY-BOOK, by serv∣ing more Explicitly the Interests of PIETY in Two Instances, with Two Supplements. I. <HI>Family Religion Excited and Assisted.</HI> II. <HI>A Monitor for Communicants.</HI> But because it was found, that these would swell the Book beyond what was at first intended, they are laid aside; And they are to be had by them∣selves, in Two Single Sheets, at the Book∣sellers.</P>
