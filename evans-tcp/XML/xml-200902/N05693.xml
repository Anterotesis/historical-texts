<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Proceedings at two Conferences begun to be held at <HI>Fal∣mouth</HI> in <HI>Casco-Bay,</HI> in the County of <HI>York,</HI> within the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in NEW-ENGLAND, on the Twenty-Eighth Day of <HI>June</HI> 1754, between His EXCELLENCY <HI>WILLIAM SHIRLEY,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Captain-General, Go∣vernor and Commander in Chief, in and over the Province a∣foresaid, and the CHIEFS of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians; and on the Fifth Day of <HI>July</HI> following, between his said EXCELLEN∣CY, and the CHIEFS of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians.</HEAD>
<P>ON Saturday the 21st of <HI>June,</HI> in the Forenoon, the Governor attended by several Members of His Majesty's Council for the said Province, the Speaker, and se∣veral Members of the House of Representatives, with divers other Gentlemen; and accompany'd by the Honorable Col. <HI>Paul Mascarene,</HI> Commissioner from the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> embark'd on board the Ship <HI>Burryeau</HI> for <HI>Casco-Bay;</HI> and on passing Castle <HI>William</HI> was join'd by the Province Sloop <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> having on board Major-General <HI>Winslow,</HI> and other Officers of the Forces rais'd for his Majesty's Service in the intended Expedition upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> and eight Transport Vessels, on Board of which were 500 of the said Forces; the remaining 300, which were not then ready, being ordered to embark and follow in a few Days.</P>
<P>On Wednesday the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> in the Forenoon, the Governor came to an Anchor in the Harbour at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> where he found the Province Sloop and Transports had ar∣riv'd the Day before, and the Forces encamp'd on <HI>Bang</HI>'s Island; that the Honorable <HI>Daniel Warner, Peter Gilman</HI> and <HI>Clement March,</HI> <ABBR>Esqrs</ABBR> Commissioners from the Go∣vernment of <HI>New Hampshire</HI> were come to meet him, and that the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians had waited there some Days for his Arrival.</P>
<P>Upon going on Shoar the Governor was inform'd by Capt. <HI>Lithgow,</HI> the Commander of <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort, that a Party of the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians, which he suppos'd to be then within the distance of 7 or 8 Miles of it, had, in Answer to his Excellency's Letter of Notification to the Indians, to meet him at the Interview, declar'd, that they should not come, because they had not yet wip'd away the Blood of the two Indians belonging to their Tribe, which had been kill'd the last Year within the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire.</HI></P>
<P>The same Day, in the Afternoon, the Governor receiv'd a Letter from Capt. <HI>Bradbury,</HI> dated at St. <HI>George</HI>'s the 18th of <HI>June,</HI> inclosing one from Father <HI>Gounon,</HI> the <HI>Jesuit</HI> of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe of Indians to Father <HI>Audran</HI> the <HI>Jesuit</HI> of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Tribe, dated at <HI>Penobscot</HI> the 4th of <HI>June</HI> 1754, which he had intercepted by Means of the In∣dian, to whom the Carriage of it was intrusted; and informing his Excellency, that the same Indian had told him, <Q>That he had lately had the Carriage of another Letter from <HI>Canada</HI> committed to him, which he lost upon the Road; that it was a bad one, tho' he would not undertake to say fully what the Contents of it were; but that he certainly
<PB N="4" REF="007222_0003_102B3FC1EDF5AFA0"/>knew that the <HI>French</HI> Indians, in great Numbers, were determin'd to come over [from <HI>Canada</HI>] to this Side of the Country, when the Corn should be fit to gather, and fall upon the <HI>English.</HI></Q>—Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> also inform'd his Excellency in the same Letter, "That he was almost sure, the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians would not meet him at <HI>Falmouth.</HI>" (As they had likewise declared to his Excellency, in a Letter wrote to him by them in behalf of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians, as well as themselves, before he left <HI>Boston,</HI>) <Q>tho' he [Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI>] thought the <HI>French</HI> would find it difficult to perswade the <HI>Pe∣nobscots</HI> to break with the <HI>English,</HI> unless they should be forc'd into it by great Num∣bers of <HI>French</HI> Indians from <HI>Canada.</HI></Q></P>
<P>On the Day following the Governor receiv'd a Letter from <HI>James Bane,</HI> dated in <HI>June;</HI> in which he inform'd him, <Q>That the Chief Man's Son of <HI>Passam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quody</HI> had told Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> and himself at St. <HI>Georges,</HI> that the Indians of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Tribe had sent two Belts of Wampum to the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> to get them to join <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ca∣nada</HI> Indians and themselves against the <HI>English;</HI> and that there was absolutely a Number of <HI>Canada</HI> Indians, then at <HI>Penobscot,</HI> on that Business; but that they had not determin'd what to do as yet.</Q></P>

From the insolent Behaviour of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians in general towards the In∣habitants of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, and at <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort, it was apprehended for some Weeks before the Interview, that they were upon the point of breaking out into open Hostilities; so that their Arrival at <HI>Falmouth</HI> to meet his Excellency was contrary to Expectation, and seems owing to the Accident of their Prielt's having left them 20 Days before, to go to <HI>Canada,</HI> against the Advice of the Jesuit of the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> and the mis-carriage of that Jesuit's Letter before-mention'd to him.</P>
<P>Besides the before-mention'd Information given to the Governor by Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> concerning the Refusal of the <HI>Arsseguntacook</HI> Indians to be present at the Interview (which in his Excellency's Conference soon after with the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians was con∣firm'd by them,) Governor <HI>Wentworth</HI> had acquainted him a few Weeks before he set out for <HI>Falmouth,</HI> that some of those Indians had then lately carried off a whole Family Captive, and plunder'd two Houses within the Province of <HI>New Hampshire;</HI> so that there was no Foundation to expect that they would send any of their Tribe to the Treaty.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians, with whom it appears from their Jesuit's Letter to the Jesuit of the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> as well as from their own to the Governor, how active and successful that Priest had been in perswading them not to meet his Excellency at <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI> but to insist upon his coming to treat with them at <HI>St. George</HI>'s River; tho' there seem'd very little, if any, grounds to expect, <HI>they</HI> would be induced to come to <HI>Falmouth;</HI> yet as it had been determined in Council before his Excellency left <HI>Boston,</HI> that it would be below the Dignity of his Majesty's Governor, and the Honour of the Pro∣vince, for his Excellency to submit, in case of that Tribe's peremptory Refusal to meet him at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> which Place he had appointed for the Interview, to go to them at <HI>St. George</HI>'s; and at the same Time his Excellency look'd upon it to be a Point of considerable Consequence for facilitating the several Parts of the Service, he was en∣gaged in upon <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, to have a friendly Conference with them at this Con∣juncture; he determined to use his utmost Efforts to bring them to meet him at <HI>Fol∣mouth,</HI> and accordingly forthwith dispatch'd a Sloop to <HI>St. George</HI>'s for that Purpose, with his Orders to Capt. <HI>Bradbury,</HI> contain'd in the following Letter;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Would have you let the Chiefs of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians know, that in compliance with their and the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Tribe's repeated Request in their Letter dated from <HI>Richmond</HI> the last Winter; wherein they press'd me to come early this Summer in Person to treat with them upon the Matters therein mention'd, I am come to this Place, as soon as the public Affairs of the Province, and <HI>their</HI> Hunting Season would permit me, to meet them; and tell them, that I bring with me a sincere Dispo∣sition to renew and strengthen the antient Friendship, which hath from Time to Time subsisted between this Government and their Tribe.</P>
<P>I would likewise have you let them know, that I have thought very much upon what they wrote to me in their last Letter from St. <HI>George's,</HI> concerning their Expecta∣tion, that I would come thither to treat with them, and that River's being the usual Place of Conference between the Governors of this Province, and their Tribe; and you must tell them from me, that they are greatly mistaken in that Matter: Neither Gover∣nor <HI>Shutt,</HI> nor Governor <HI>Dummer,</HI> nor Governor <HI>Belcher</HI> ever met them at St. <HI>George</HI>'s; they (the Indians) came from St. <HI>George</HI>'s to <HI>Arrowsick</HI> Island in 1717, to meet the first of those Governors, and always either to <HI>Boston</HI> or <HI>Falmouth</HI> to treat with the other two: It is true that I appointed my first Interview and Conference with them in 1742, to be held at St. <HI>George</HI>'s; but the Reason of my choosing that Place then, was, because I was desirous of visiting the most remote Settlements in that Part of the Province, at my first taking the Administration of the Government upon me; and if I <HI>had</HI> come to St. <HI>George</HI>'s at that Time upon <HI>their Request,</HI> yet even that would be a strong Reason why they should now come to meet me at <HI>Falmouth;</HI> where Col. <HI>Mascarene</HI> hath accompany'd me, as a Commissioner from the Government of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and three Commissioners from the Government of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> to have an Interview likewise with them, on the Part of those Provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007222_0006_102B3FC702F90068"/>
Upon the whole, I would have you acquaint them, that <HI>I sully expeil</HI> them to come to me to this Place; that I have sent a Sloop to bring them thither, and <HI>English</HI> Colours for them to make use of upon this Occasion; and order'd you to attend and conduct them; that if they persist in their Refusal to do it, after I am come so far to brighten the Covenant Chain with them, and so early in the Year to gratify them; I shall look upon it as a great Affront to the <HI>English</HI> Governments, and a sure Mark that they are indifferent whether they preserve our antient Amity and Kindness for them or not.</P>
<P>I particularly observe, what they write to me at the End of their Letter; in which they say, "That they write in behalf of the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> as well as themselves." This must be
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Expression usd by them in their Letter to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> <HI>crooked Talk;</HI> the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians came here some Days before my Arrival, to treat with me at this Place; the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians therefore had no Power from them to write to me on their behalf in that Manner: This is I say <HI>crooked palk;</HI> it doth not resemble that Truth of Heart, which the <HI>Penobscots</HI> ever profess'd to have; but must proceed from some bad Counsel given to them, in order to create a Mitun∣derstanding between the <HI>English</HI> and them; and to destroy the Peace and Friendship between us.</P>
<P>Upon this Occasion I would have you remind them of their Priest's Letter to me, which I communicated to them the last Summer; in which he endeavour'd to diswade me from sending Commissioners the last Year, to distribute the Presents from this Go∣vernment to them; and of the Proofs I then sent them of his Artifices to raise Jealousies among them, in order to break off our Friendship: And I would have you assure them, that I have lately receiv'd undoubted Proofs of the same Priest's acting at this Time the like treacherous Part to them, and using his utmost Endeavours to engage them in Acts of Hostility against us.</P>
<P>And I would have you further tell them, That if this Government had not a great Regard for them, and a real Desire to continue their antient Friendship and Kindness to them, I should not have been so earnest in my Endeavours to perpetuate Peace and Amity between us; but the Success of that must depend upon their Meeting me here; and their Refusal to do it will be look'd upon by me, as an high Affront and a full Proof that they are determin'd to break off Friendship, with us.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am Sir, Your Friend and Servant, W. SHIRLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>At the same Time; as the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians were the original Proprietors of the Lands upon <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, and the only Indians now interested in them, and there was Reason to expect that the Presence of the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> who would probably come fully instincted by their Priest to use their utmost Influence over the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> in opposition to the intended March to the Head of <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> &amp;c. the erecting a Fort higher up the River than <HI>Richmond,</HI> and making further the Settlements upon it, would embarrass the Conference with the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> upon those Points; the Governor determin'd with the Advice of His Majesty's Council, to have a seperate Conference with the last mention'd Indians, and dispatch them away from <HI>Falmouth</HI> (if possible) before the Arrival of the <HI>Penobscots</HI> there.</P>
<P>The Delay likewise, which the Governor's staying for the Arrival of the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> before he treated with the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians, would have occasion'd to the Proceed∣ing of the Troops, whose Presence at <HI>Casco,</HI> during the Conference with those Indians, it was apprehended would contribute to make them acquiesce in the March of the Forces thro' their Country, building the intended Forts up the River <HI>Kennebeck</HI> above <HI>Richmond,</HI> and making other Settlements upon it, was another Motive for hastening on the Con∣ference with that Tribe.</P>
<P>Accordingly his Excellency receiv'd a Visit from the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> the same Day at his Lodgings; and appointed the Day following, being Friday the 28th of <HI>June</HI> to speak with them in publick.</P>

<P><HI>Friends and Brethren of the</HI> Norridgwalk <HI>Tribe,</HI></P>
<P>'THrough the Protection of the Divine Providence I am arrived safe at this Place, after a tedious and rough Passage; and I hope I now see you and your Wives and Children in good Health.</P>
<P>'Before I imbark'd, I sent Orders that upon your Arrival here you should have every Thing provided, necessary for your Refreshment; and I hope your Entertain∣ment hath been to your Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'In the last Winter I receiv'd a Letter from your Tribe, the <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and <HI>Arsse∣gunticook</HI> Indians, pressing me to come to <HI>Richmond,</HI> early this Summer, to treat with you and them, instead of sending Commissioners to you at the usual Time; and in Compliance with your Request, I am now come in Person as soon as the publick Business of my Government, and your Hunting Season would admit, to renew the Covenant with you.</P>
<P>'The Honourable Colonel <HI>Mascarene,</HI> who is appointed a Commissioner in behalf of the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia;</HI> and the three Honourable Gentlemen on my left Hand, who are Commissioners from the Province of <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> [<HI>New-Hampshire</HI>] are come here likewise to join with me in brightning the Chain.</P>
<P>'I was in Hopes to have found the <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians here at my Arrival, that I might have saluted you all together; but as I am desirous of taking as early an Opportunity, as may be, of greeting <HI>your</HI> Tribe, and having a Friendly Con∣ference with you, I am determin'd not to wait for their coming; but to speak with you to Morrow, at 10 O'Clock in the Forenoon, and shall order a great Gun to be fir'd as a Signal for you to come on Shore, where you shall find an Officer ready to Conduct you to the Place of Conference.'</P>
<P>Then the Governor ask'd them, whether all their Chief Men of the Tribe were present; and whether any <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians were with them.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Job,</HI> in the Name of the Indians, addrefs'd the Governour as follows,</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'What your Excellency says is very good.</P>
<P>'There are some of the <HI>Penobscots</HI> with us.</P>
<P>'<HI>Passaguéant</HI> is not well; but will be here to Morrow, God willing: God hath brought us here; and we are glad to see you in good Health: <HI>Passagueant</HI> and <HI>Quenoiis</HI> knew of our coming here, and join with us in saluting You. Our young Men rejoice to see your Excellency: We want nothing but Peace. — God knows our Hearts, that they are good: When Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> inform'd us you was coming, we left our Corn and other Business to meet you: All our young Men and Women are desirous that Peace should continue.</P>
<P>'We should be glad of some Tobacco and Paint — Our young Men are always de∣sirous of painting themselves according to our Fashion at these Meetings.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007222_0008_102B3FCCC1E62520"/>
'Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> told us, we should want for nothing: We want some Ammuni∣tion to kill Game with, as our living is wholly on fresh Meat.'</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR:</SPEAKER>
<P>Your young Men shall be supply'd with Ammunition and Paint; and I will order more Rum, and some fresh Beef for your Refreshment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Job:</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We thank your Excellency for your Kindness to us.</P>

<P>How many are there of your Tribe now at <HI>Falmouth?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Job:</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Forty-two; Men, Women and Children.</P>

<P>Twenty-seven.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>Are any of the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Job:</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>How many of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians are with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Job:</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There are Eight of that Tribe here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>Do these <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians intend to remain with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Job:</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, they design to return to <HI>Penobscot,</HI> as soon as the Treaty is over: They will open their Hearts and speak to your Excellency freely. — We desire you would order five Gallons of Rum a Day to be distributed among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't grudge you that Quantity of Rum; but am concern'd least it should over-heat your young Men, and make them quarrel one with another; and as we are met here on weighty Affairs, I would have you consider coolly of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Job:</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We will take care that our young Men keep themselves sober: We desire no more than two Gallons of Rum, and one Gallon of Mellasses for our Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have it.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then his Excellency the Governour drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health, and Prof∣perity to the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> and that Peace might continue between them, and the English Colonies.— Which Healths were pledg'd by all the Indians present.</P>
<P>Then the Indians withdrew.</P>

<P>THE Governour, the Commissioners aforenamed, and other Gentlemen, being affembled in the Meeting-House at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> (the Town-House being found in∣convenient the Day before,) and attended there by the Indians; After the usual Salu∣tations,</P>

Then his Excellency spoke to them as follows;</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'I Hope I meet you all in good Health this Morning: I gave Orders since I saw you here Yesterday, that every Thing, which you and your Squaws then desir'd of me, should be provided for you as soon as possible.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'In your Letter to me from <HI>Richmond,</HI> the last Winter you say thus;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have a long Time wanted that which is good, viz. <HI>Peace:</HI> We also want that which is good; and we want to see you the next Spring; and when we hear each other talk, we will both endeavour to do that, which is right be∣tween us.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>'You have well spoken, <HI>Brethren,</HI> in what you have said; and I am now come to talk with you upon it; and to do what is necessary for settling our Peace upon a lasting Foundation.</P>
<P>'The <HI>French</HI> have of late built Forts in several Places upon this Continent, within the Territories of King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> which hath greatly disturb'd our Peace in those Par's; and I am inform'd, that they either have, or design soon to erect one on the River <HI>Ken∣nebeck,</HI> or the Carrying-Place called <HI>Wa-non-du-wa wan-nock,</HI> near the Head of it, which is within the Limits of this Government: If they should be suffer'd to do that, <HI>Brethren,</HI> it would soon destroy your and our Peace upon this River. I have there∣fore brought with me a strong Body of Soldiers to march up to the Head of it, and over the Carrying-Place, in order to discover whether the <HI>French</HI> have made any Settlements, or built any Forts there, or not; and in case they have, or are attempting to do it, I shall summon them in a peaceable Manner to retire, and if they shall refuse to depart out of the <HI>English</HI> Territories, I will drive them off by Force.</P>
<P>'Further, <HI>Brethren,</HI> In order to hinder the <HI>French</HI> from making Incroachments upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> it is my Intention to build a strong House upon it, higher up than <HI>Richmond;</HI> and a large Magazine to lodge our Stores at, in our Way thither: And as this strong House will be nearer your Head-Quarters at <HI>Norridgwalk,</HI> than that at <HI>Rich∣mond</HI> is, I design to remove the Truck Trade from <HI>Richmond</HI> to that Place; so that then you will have less Way to come for your necessary Supplies than you now have: And in case we should have a War with the <HI>French,</HI> (which we shall use all Means in our Power to prevent, and I hope will not happen) this strong House will be a Place of Shelter and Protection to you, as well as to the <HI>English,</HI> against their Hostilities.</P>
<P>'You will judge, <HI>Brethren,</HI> how well dispos'd my Heart is towards you in this Mat∣ter, by my hiding from you nothing, which I have in it; and I hope you think what I say is right.</P>
<P>'You moreover say, <HI>Brethren,</HI> in your Letter to me, that you <Q>like well Gover∣nour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, and what was then done; and that Governour <HI>Dummer</HI> then set the Bounds between the <HI>English</HI> and you.</Q></P>
<P>'You may be assur'd, That We shall on our Part, inviolably observe Governour <HI>Dummer's</HI> Treaty; and that the <HI>English</HI> shall not in making Settlements pass the Bounds, which are there set between you and them: And we expect that you likewise shall on your Part keep that Treaty.</P>
<P>'By <HI>that</HI> it is agreed, <Q>That the <HI>English</HI> shall and may peaceably and quietly enter upon, improve and forever enjoy, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and singular their Rights of Land, and former <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, Properties and Possessions, within the Eastern Parts of this Province; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with all Hands, Mets, Shoars, Beaches and Fisheries within the same; without any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or Claim by you or any other Indians; and be in no ways molested, interrupted, or disturbed therein.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007222_0010_102B3FD04C838978"/>
'<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Hand, <Q>That you and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Indians, within this Province, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and their natural Descendants, shall respectively hold and enjoy all your and their Lands, Liberties and Properties, not by you or them con∣veyed, or sold to, or possessed, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any of the English Subjects:</Q> Also, <Q>The Privilege of Hunting, Fishing and Fowling as formerly.</Q></P>
<P>'Now, in pursuance of this Treaty, <HI>Brethren,</HI> I pronate you in the Name of the English Governments, that none of his Majesty's Subjects within them, shall be allowed to make Settlements upon any Lands above <HI>Richmond,</HI> for which they cannot produce good and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Deeds of Conveyance, either from you or your Ancestors: And for the better Prelervation of your Rights and Privileges of Hunting, Fishing and Fowling, whole and intire to your selves, a Law had been lately pass'd by the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> whereby all his Majesty's Subjects within it are prohibited, under severe Penalties, from trespassing upon you: On the other Hand, <HI>We expect that the</HI> English <HI>shall have Liberty to make settlements wherever they shall think proper, on any Lands which they have fairly purchased of your Ancestors, without any Molestation or Hindrance from You, or any other</HI> Indian <HI>Tribe.</HI></P>
<P>'But I must observe to you, with regard to the Extent of the Limits of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Territories upon this Continent; that you are not concern'd in any Disputes which may arise on that Point: This is a Matter which lies wholly between Us and the <HI>French;</HI> and we do not desire you, as the <HI>French</HI> do, to expose your Lives in any of our Quarrels with them: All, that we expect, is, That you leave us to decide our Disputes, and consult your own Safety by remaining Neutral.</P>
<P>'I have now <HI>talk'd with you</HI> upon the principal Matters, which are mention'd in your Letter to me; and shall not proceed further in the Conference, until I have receiv'd your Answer to what I have said upon them.</P>
<P>'Before you give it, I would have you maturely consider and deliberate upon every Thing, which I have now spoke; for which purpose, least any Article of it should escape your Memory, I shall commit what I have said to the Interpreter in Writing; and he, when you are retir'd and deliberating upon it, shall distinctly interpret every Paragraph of it to you again, and I shall expect you to meet me here with your Answer ready to be deliver'd on Monday Morning next, at 10 O'Clock, when you shall have the same Sig∣nal made for you to come on Shoar, as you had to Day.</P>
<P>'I shall say nothing further to you at present than that these are weighty Matters, which nearly concern the Welfare of your Tribe, and I hope your Answer to me upon them will be a wise one, and such as will promote <HI>that</HI> by securing our Friendship and Kindness to you.'</P>
<P><HI>Qumois,</HI> in behalf of the Indians, addressing himself to the Governour, said,—I would speak to your Excellency.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'We thank you for your kind Speech to us, and for opening your Heart so freely to us; we see your Heart is good.'</P>
<P>Then the Governour drank the same Healthy that he did the Day before—which were pledg'd by the Indians.</P>

<HEAD>MONDAY <HI>July</HI> 1. 1754.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT as before.</P>
<P>AFter Salutations, Mr. <HI>Ezekiel Price</HI> was sworn to make true Entries of what should pass between the Governour and the Indians at this Con-ference; as also that the Entries already made by him in it were just and true, according to the best of his Knowledge and Skill.</P>
<P>Then his Excellency ask'd the Indians, if they had consider'd what he had said to them on Saturday, and were ready to give him their Answer to it.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Job,</HI> holding in his Hand the Governour's Letter to the Indians in the last Win∣ter, spoke in their Name, as follows;</P>
<P>'Here is the Letter which your Excellency wrote; it is a good Letter, we like it well,—all our Brethren the Indians like it well.</P>
<P>'We have carefully consider'd what you said to us on Saturday.</P>
<P><HI>'As to the strong House, you intend to build on the River</HI> Kennebeck, <HI>we cannot consent to it's being built; it is our Land, and we get our Living by Hunting:</HI> Rich∣mond <HI>Fort on the River belongs to King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>and we are content it should re∣main, as it stands; but we can't consent to the Building of any other Fort, or making any new Settlements on that River.</HI></P>
<P>'Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty is lik'd by all the Indians; and we all desire to stand by that, and submit to it's Rules.</P>
<P>'We want nothing but Peace; but we can't agree that you should go any further up the River.</P>
<P>'We are here in behalf of the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> and all the Indians; they know of our coming, and it is the same, as if they all were present.</P>
<P>'When you see us, it is the same Thing as if you see all the Tribes of Indians.</P>
<P>'We tell you our Heart.—If you should send your Army up <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, you will not see a <HI>Frenchman;</HI> there is none upon the River, nor near it.—GOD knows what I speak is true; I speak from my Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'Your Brethren of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Tribe, and some of the <HI>Penobscots</HI> are met here; we are come for Good.—This Wampum is a Token of the Sincerity of our Hearts, holding three Strings of Wampum in his Hand, which he gave the Governour.</P>
<P>'If we agree to that which is Good, all the Indians will stand by it.'</P>
<P>GOV'R: 'You say the Indians now present are here in behalf of the <HI>Penobscots</HI> to treat with me; and, that the <HI>Penobscots</HI> will stand by what is now agreed to; and that it is the same Thing as if their Tribe was present.</P>
<P>'I have lately receiv'd two Letters from St. <HI>George</HI>'s; one sent from the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians before I came from <HI>Boston,</HI> and the other since I arriv'd at <HI>Casco.</HI></P>
<P>'In the first of these Letters the <HI>Penobscots</HI> told me, they expected I would come to St. <HI>George</HI>'s; and that they could not come to <HI>Falmouth</HI> to treat with me.</P>
<P>'The <HI>Penobscots</HI> also sent me Word, since I came here, that they would not treat with me, unless I came to St. <HI>George</HI>'s.—And by a Letter I have in my Hand, I am satisfied they receiv'd this Advice from their Priest.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007222_0012_102B3FD40410FC30"/>
'I can't but think therefore that you are mistaken, when you tell me that any Indi∣ans now present are authorized to appear in behalf of the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> and to act for them; since that Tribe hath declar'd to the contrary.'—</P>
<P>The Governour made here a short Pause, expecting an Answer from the Indians; but they seeming a little confounded, and making none, he proceeded;</P>
<P>'I now look upon my self as treating with your Tribe only.</P>
<P>'I regard your Tribe as much as I do the <HI>Pencbscots;</HI> and there is no Occasion for their being present, or consulted upon the principal Points of this Conference.</P>
<P>'You say you stand by Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty; so do we.—Most of the Indians who were concern'd in making of it, are dead: Governour <HI>Dummer</HI> was then the Governour of this Province; but now I am the Governour of it.</P>
<P>'It was therefore necessary, that that Treaty should be committed to Writing, that Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Successors, and the present Generation of Indians might know what was then agreed upon in it.</P>
<P>'You well know the Mark of <HI>Wenemouet, Loron, Edger-Emet,</HI> and the others of the principal Indians, who made and sign'd that Treaty; and as they are dead, their Marks must now speak for them.—'</P>
<P>His Excellency then produc'd the original Treaty made with Governour <HI>Dummer</HI> to the Indians, who after having perus'd the Marks of the Indian Chiefs, which sign'd it, observ'd to his Excellency that none of the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> had sign'd the Treaty.</P>
<P><HI>Governour</HI> SHIRLEY,</P>
<P>'You told me just now, That you appear'd for the <HI>Penobscots:</HI> That was the Case with the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians at the Time of making Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty; they were delegated by the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> St. <HI>Francois,</HI> St. <HI>Johns,</HI> and other Tribes of Indi∣ans, to represent them at that Conference, and conclude a Treaty on their behalf with the English: — Besides, Your Tribe hath at every Treaty since that Time, as well as the present Conference declar'd, That they <HI>lik'd it well, and will stand by it; and submit to it's Rules.</HI> Particularly, When I met you at St. <HI>George's,</HI> thirteen Years ago, <HI>Loron</HI> who was your Speaker at that Interview, and Col. <HI>Lewis,</HI> and all the other Indians then present, produc'd the Counterpart of this Treaty to me; and insisted upon it as what was binding between us. And at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> in 1749, your Tribe, the St. <HI>Francois, Pe∣nobscots</HI> and <HI>Weeweenocks,</HI> all sign'd the Treaty then concluded: And by that Treaty you made the same Agreement with the English, which your Predecessors made with them in Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty.'</P>
<P>[Then his Excellency produc'd to them the Treaty made and concluded at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in 1749,] and proceeded thus;</P>
<P>'This Treaty, (<HI>viz</HI> of 1749,) was ratify'd by your Tribe the last Year; and the Year before; and several of you now present then sign'd your Marks to it.'</P>
<P>[Then his Excellency caus'd the afore-recited Paragraph in Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, concerning the Agreement that the English should have and enjoy all their former Rights and Possessions in the Lands, which had been sold and conveyed to them by the Indians, to be read over again;] and spoke to them as follows;</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'I must now observe to you, That above One Hundred Years ago, the English purchas'd of your Fathers all the Lands lying on the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> as high up as <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sserunsike:</HI> That in Consequence of that Purchase they took Possession of and made Settlements upon them; and (at the Desire of the Indians) antiently built at <HI>Taconnet</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="007222_0013_102B3FD64C587DF0"/>Falls a Trading-House, where a greater Trade was carned on, than there is now in all the English Truck-Houses together; as you have in the Conference of last Year acknow∣ledg'd: And there are still to be seen at <HI>Cushnock</HI> and <HI>Taconnet</HI> old Ruins of Houses, which plainly prove that there were Houses formerly built there by the English.</P>
<P>'At the Treaty made by the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> and other Eastern Indians with Gover∣nour <HI>Shute</HI> in 1717, it was agreed, <Q>That the English should settle the Lands where their Predecessors had done". And by Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty in 1726, That the English should settle upon, and forever peaceably enjoy all their Rights of Land and former Possessions within the Eastern Parts of this Province, and whatever had been sold and conveyed to them by the Indians.</Q>— If the Indians had not been con∣vinc'd at the Time of making those Treaties, that the Lands formerly possessed and settled by the English, and which had been purchased by them of the Indians, were fair∣ly fold to them, they would not have entred into those Agreements.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'As to building the intended strong House and Magazine higher up <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River than <HI>Richmond,</HI> I must remind you of what pass'd between us on the second Day of this Conference; in which I open'd my Heart to you: I told you, that the only Motive of my doing it was to keep the <HI>French</HI> from coming into the River, and to pro∣tect all the Lands upon it, <HI>Your</HI> Lands as well as those of the <HI>English,</HI> against them; This is what all Princes do within their own Dominiens, without asking Leave of those who inhabit the Lands there: The building of Forts don't take away the private Pro∣perty of the Subjects in their Lands: And as by Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty (which you say <HI>is Right, and you like well, and will stand by;</HI>) and by the Treaty of Peace in 1749, your Tribe and the other Indian Tribes who were Parties to them have <HI>sub∣mitted to be ruled and governed by the King of</HI> Great-Britain'<HI>s Laws, and desired to have the Benefit of the same.</HI></P>
<P>[Here that Paragraph was read to them out of both those Treaties.]</P>
<P>'King <HI>GEORGE</HI> hath an undoubted Right by vertue of those Treaties, as well as by the established Law of Nations, to build Forts upon your Lands in the Eastern Parts of this Government, as well as those of the <HI>English:</HI> Your Tribe and the <HI>English</HI> are made Brethren by those Treaties, and King <HI>GEORGE</HI> is our common Father; and this <HI>Fort</HI> is to be built for the Protection of all his Children, the <HI>Indians</HI> as well as the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'I would put you in Mind of what happen'd in Times past; About 30 or 40 Years ago, the <HI>French</HI> stirr'd up your's and the neighbouring Indian Tribes, when they were at Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> to make War with them—The Indians during the Continuance of it committed Ravages in our Borders, and kill'd several of our People; But what Fruits did the Tribe of <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> reap, by the Mischief which they then join'd in doing to the <HI>English;</HI> they had several of their young Men cut off, and the <HI>English</HI> at last, being highly provok'd by their Hostilities, sell upon the old Town of <HI>Norridgwalk,</HI> destroy'd many of the Tribe, and drove them all off from their Lands, which by Right of Conduest in War (a Title held to be good by all the Indian Tribes in general among themselves,) the <HI>English</HI> became Masters of, and it was intirely ow∣ing to <HI>their</HI> Kindness to <HI>your</HI> Tribe, that you were restor'd to those Lands by Governor <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, and suffer'd to return and live in Peace upon your present Possessions.</P>
<P>'This Instance, <HI>Brethren,</HI> of the Calamity which going to War with the <HI>English</HI> brought upon your Tribe in that Day, and of the Kindness which they then shew'd to you, in permitting you to return and live again upon your Lands, after your Tribe had forfeited all Pretensions to their Friendship by being guilty of a Breach of the most solemn Engagements, should now be well consider'd by you: And it ought to be a Warning to your never to suffer yourselves to be seduced again by the <HI>French,</HI> to enter, into War with the <HI>English,</HI> which if it should ever happen, must sooner or later end in the Destruction of the small Remnant of your Tribe.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007222_0014_102B3FD853D39790"/>
'It will be much wiser for you to live in Peace, and enjoy your Lands, under the Pro∣tection of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>'And as a Token of the Sincerity of my Heart, in what I have said to you, I deliver you this Belt of Wampum. Gave a Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>'I have another Article, <HI>Brethren,</HI> to speak with you upon.</P>
<P>'By Governor <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty it is agreed, That <Q>if any Conttoverfies or Diffe∣rences should at any Time after happen to arise, between any of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> for any real or supposed Wrong, or Injury done on either Side, no private Revenge shall be taken for the same, but proper Application made to his Majesty's Government upon the Place, for Remedy or Redress thereof, in a due Course of Justice.</Q></P>
<P>'This was ratified by the Treaty of Peace made in 1749, and the <HI>Norridgwalks, Penobscots, Arssegunticooks,</HI> and <HI>Weeweenocks</HI> thereby engag'd further <Q>That if any In∣dians should at any Time commit any Acts of Hostility against the <HI>English,</HI> they would join their young Men with the <HI>English,</HI> in reducing such <HI>Indians</HI> to Reason.</Q></P>
<P>'Now, <HI>Brethren,</HI> It hath unfortunately happen'd that two Indians of the <HI>Arssegunti∣cook</HI> Tribe were kill'd the last Year, by two <HI>Englishmen</HI> in the Government of <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> for several Injuries and Insults which these Indians had been guilty of within it: The Cir∣cumstances of which I shall relate to you. In <HI>April</HI> 1752, two Indians of that Tribe named <HI>Sabatis</HI> and <HI>Christi,</HI> came to <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the aforesaid Province, where they were friendly entertain'd above a Month; but at their going off they stole two Negroes, which they bound and carried over <HI>Merrimack</HI> River, where one of them made his Escape and return'd to his Master; but the other was carried to <HI>Canada,</HI> and sold to a <HI>French</HI> Officer at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> at which Place he still remains; or was seen very lately.</P>
<P>'In <HI>May</HI> following a Party of ten or twelve <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians met with four <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Men, at a Branch of <HI>Contoocook</HI> River, within the Government of <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> shot one of them dead upon the Spot, captivated and carried two of them to <HI>Canada,</HI> where they were detain'd some Months, and until they were ransom'd; the other with Difficulty making his Escape: All which was done in Time of Peace.</P>
<P>'In 1753, the aforenamed <HI>Sabatis</HI> came again to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where being reproached by the Wife of the Man, from whom he and his Companion had the Year before stolen the Negro, which they had sold in <HI>Canada,</HI> he together with another Indian then in Company, was guilty of great Outrages to her; and it was by these and other Injuries and Insults committed by them there, that the two <HI>English</HI> Men were provok'd to kill them soon after; but the Government of <HI>Piscataqua</HI> disapproving the Action (as is well known from their Proceedings against the Persons, who were suppos'd to be guilty of it) have disclaim'd the private Revenge, which the two <HI>English</HI> Men in their Province took of the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians, for the Injuries and Insults which the <HI>English</HI> had re∣ceiv'd from them, and us'd Endeavours to bring to Punishment the Offenders, who were guilty of a Breach of the said Treaties: And you see, Brethren, that that Government have now sent three Commissioners to meet the <HI>Arssegunticooks</HI> here, in order to have Injuries on both Sides redress'd in a Course of Justice, and an amicable Manner.</P>
<P>'The <HI>Arssegunticooks</HI> ought to have acted the like Part, and met us here, especially as since they knew of the killing of those two Indians, they renewed the Treaty of Peace made with the Governments of <HI>Piscataqua</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts</HI> in 1749, by signing a Ratification of it at <HI>Richmond</HI> in the Fall of the Year, and accepted Part of the Presents which the Govern∣ment of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> made to the Indians upon that Occasion; and join'd the last Winter with your Tribe and the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> in pressing me to meet them in these Parts early this Summer: But instead of doing this, they have within the last seven Weeks captivated an <HI>English</HI> Man, with his Wife and three Children in the Province of <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and plunder'd his House, as they did at the same Time the House of ano∣ther <HI>English</HI> Man in the Neighbourhood, which happen'd fortunately to have left it a Day or two before the Indians came: And they declare that they will take further Revenge upon the <HI>English;</HI> for which Purpose they have a Party out now near <HI>Richmond,</HI> waiting for an Opportunity to do it.</P>

<HEAD>TUESDAY <HI>July</HI> 2. 1754.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT as before.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>'I Have caus'd Instruments of Ratification of the Treaties of Peace made by your Tribe, and the other Eastern <HI>Indians</HI> with Governour <HI>Dummer</HI> in 1726; and with the Commissioners from this Government, and that of <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> in 1749, to be prepared for us to sign, as was propos'd between us Yesterday.— But before we pro∣ceed to do this, I must call upon you to open your whole Hearts to me with the same Sincerity that I have us'd in diselosing what is in mine to you.</P>
<P>'You will not think much of my being so solicitous to know whether I can now depend upon your pacifick Professions, if you recollect your Behaviour towards us soon after your signing the Treaty of 1749.— About nine or ten Months after that, your Tribe join'd with some of the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> and <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians in captivating seven∣teen of the People of this Government; <HI>viz.</HI> thirteen from <HI>Swan-Island,</HI> one from <HI>Richmond,</HI> two from <HI>Sheepscot,</HI> and one from <HI>Brunswick;</HI> as also in killing a great Num∣ber of our Cattle: The Reason given by you for the doing of this Mischief was, that it was done to satisfy you for two <HI>Indians,</HI> which happen'd to be kill'd by some <HI>English:</HI> After which you declar'd to us, That the <HI>Indian</HI> Blood was then wip'd away—And that the <HI>English</HI> might go safely about their Business; for that it was Peace between all the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>'The <HI>English</HI> thinking you sincere in this Declaration left their Garrisons, and return'd to their Dwelling-Houses; but notwithstanding your Declarations, when the <HI>English</HI> were off their Guard, some of the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians soon after captivated three Boys at <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> kill'd some Cattle, and burnt and plunder'd several Houses; and soon after that kill'd a Man coming from <HI>North Yarmouth;</HI> A short Time after this, six Men were captivated, and one Man kill'd at the <HI>New-Meadows,</HI> together with nineteen Cattle, as was also a considerable Number of Cattle at <HI>Richmond</HI> about the same Time; and in doing this last mention'd Mischief, <HI>your</HI> Tribe was principally con∣cern'd, being assisted only by a few <HI>Canada</HI> Indians in some Part of it; other Part of it being done by your Tribe alone: And we are certain that these Accounts are true, because we have receiv'd them from some of your own Tribe.</P>

'What can you say in Justification of your selves for this Behaviour?</P>
</SP>
<P>[ After a short Pause without Answer from the Indians,] the Governour proceeded,</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>'I have been inform'd since my Arrival here, That a Letter has been sent from the <HI>Canada</HI> Indians to the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> acquainting them that they intended to pass over to our Eastern Frontiers, when the Corn should be ripe, and tall upon the <HI>Engish</HI> Settle∣ments there.</P>
<P>'I now require of you to inform me, what you know concerning this Matter?</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>Job</HI> beginning to speak to the Governour; <HI>Quenois,</HI> who sat next to him, turn'd towards him, and said in a low Voice, — <HI>Besure you tell no more Lies;</HI> — <HI>If you do, the Governour will certainly find you out:</HI> — Upon which Col. <HI>Job,</HI> after expostu∣lating with <HI>Quenois</HI> in two or three Words, proceeded thus;</P>

<P>'We will speak the Truth from our Hearts, and hide nothing from you.</P>
<P>'We heard that there was such a Letter sent from <HI>Canada</HI> to the <HI>Penobscots;</HI> and we told Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> what the <HI>Canada</HI> Indians and the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians intended to do.— They say they are coming to satisfy themselves for the Loss of the two Men belonging to the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Tribe.'</P>

<P>The <HI>Canada</HI> Indians and the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians are all the same. It is very likely that those Indians, who intend to do this Mischief, will come first to <HI>Norridgwalk,</HI> and we will then do our utmost to hinder them from doing any more Mischief.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'<HI>Brethren,</HI> I must further acquaint you, That I receiv'd a Letter from St. <HI>George</HI>'s a few Days ago, wherein I am inform'd, That your Tribe had sent two Bel's of Wampum to the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians, inviting them to join with <HI>you</HI> and the <HI>Canada</HI> Indians against the <HI>English:</HI> Is this true?'</P>

<SPEAKER>Col. <HI>Job:</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We never had any Thing but Good in our Hearts: That Letter is a Lye: <HI>The Canada Indians might send Wampum;</HI> but we never did, and we desire you would not think we over had it in our Hearts to do it.</P>

<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'Notwithstanding the Mischief you have done us since the last Treaty of Peace; if you are determin'd to live peaceably with us for the future, and are desirous of continu∣ing in Friendship with us, we will still receive you as Friends and Brethren, and sign the Ratisications of the before-mention'd Treaties of Peace: But if your Hearts are not Right towards us, I would not have you sign them; because if after that, you should commit any Acts of Hostility against us, you may depend upon it, we shall never trust you again.</P>
<P>'And I would have you well consider, that if you should provoke us to be your Enemies by your Violation of this Peace, the Consequence must in the End be the utter Destruction of the small Part of your Tribe which still remains.</P>
<P>'I hope you rightly understand what I have told you more than once in this Confe∣rence, it was my Intention to do, and the <HI>English</HI> expected from you: I shall repeat it once more, before we proceed to sign the Ratification: I told you, I should send a strong Body of Soldiers to march up <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, as high as the Head of it, and over the Carrying-Place, which is between that and the River <HI>Chaudiere;</HI> and cause
<PB N="19" REF="007222_0018_102B3FDFB9A8E510"/>a strong House to be erected, and a large Magazine for Stores in the Way to it; that the <HI>English</HI> had fairly purchas'd Lands of your Ancestors, as high up that River as <HI>Wes∣serunsick,</HI> and made Settlements there; and that we expected they should be at Liberty to make Settlements again as high as their Fathers have purchas'd of your Ancestors, when∣ever they shall think proper, without being molested by you or any other Tribe of Indians.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'We will open our Hearts and speak freely.</P>
<P>'We came here for that which is Good; and hope what we shall now do will end in Good.</P>
<P>'The <HI>English</HI> shall be welcome to renew their Settlements as high up the River as they have beretofore settled Lands, and purchased any from our Tribe; and we are content that they shall peaceably enjoy them.</P>
<P>'We have consider'd of what your Excellency told us concerning building a Fort and Magazine upon <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River; and are content you should build them where you please, and promise not to molest or disturb you in doing it.</P>
<P>'We should be glad to know on what Part of the River you propose to build the Fort and Magazine.'</P>

<P>I have given Orders to the Commander of the Troops, which I have sent up that River, to search for the most convenient Place in it to set the Fort upon; and un∣til I hear from him, I am not able to inform you concerning this Matter.— But I believe it will not be higher up the River than <HI>Taconnet</HI> Falls.</P>

<P>'I have one Word more to say to you before we part; and I wou'd have you well consider it: —</P>
<P>'If you live in Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> your Tribe may increase and multiply; but if you should be unfortunately led into a War with us, your whole Tribe will in the End probably be destroy'd, and not a Man of it left to enjoy any of your Lands.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="007222_0021_102B2381649B6238"/>
'You well know that the Number of your Tribe does not now consist of more than one third Part, it did of before the War with us in 1723 and 1724.</P>
<P>'I give you this Advice in the Sincerity of my Heart; and out of the Brotherly Kindness, which the <HI>English</HI> bear to you: I have now done.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Passagueant,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'It makes my Heart glad to hear you speak in this peaceable manner: I hope a strong Peace is now setled between us.'</P>
</SP>
<P>Then his Excellency drank the usual Healths; which were pledg'd by the Indians; And after shaking Hands the Indians withdrew.</P>
<P>The Indians having desir'd, his Excellency would allow all their young Men and Squas to entertain him with a Dance in the Afternoon, his Excellency consented, and was present at it with the Commissioners and other Gentlemen.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> After the Conference was ended, three of the Indian young Men came to the Governour and desir'd they might be carried to <HI>Boston;</HI> which was accordingly done: Also Capt. <HI>Lovel,</HI> one of their chief Men, desir'd leave of the Governour to send two young Sons of his for Education to <HI>Boston:</HI> Which his Excellency encourag'd him to do.</P>
<P>AS soon as the Conference was finished, his Excellency order'd the Troops to be im∣bark'd, and proceed directly to <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River: Accordingly they sail'd out of the Harbour for that Place on Thursday the Fourth of <HI>July;</HI> as did the Indians likewise on the same Day by his Excellency's Orders.</P>
<P>THE Contents of the Letter herein before inserted from the Governour to Capt. <HI>Bradbury,</HI> dated the 27th of <HI>June,</HI> having been communicated to the <HI>Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bscot</HI> Indians, they immediately delegated Thirteen of their Chiefs to at∣tend his Excellency at <HI>Falmouth;</HI> who imbark'd at St. <HI>George</HI>'s on board the Sloop which was sent for them, and arriv'd at <HI>Falmouth</HI> on Friday the Fifth of <HI>July</HI> in the Forenoon.</P>
<P>THE principal Matters, for which the Expedition was concerted, being settled with the <HI>Norridgwalks, viz.</HI> The marching a Body of Troops through their Country, — the erecting of Forts higher up the River <HI>Kenneb<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck</HI> than that at <HI>Richmond;</HI> — and, the making new <HI>English</HI> Settlements upon it; — The Way seem'd now clear for an In∣terview with the <HI>Penobscots.</HI></P>
<P>There was now no colourable Pretence for the <HI>Penobscots</HI> to make Objections to the Proceedings of the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> had they been ever so strongly dispos'd to oppose them, after the Acquiescence of the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians, who were the sole Proprietors of that Part of the River and Country in question, which had not been sold by them to the English: His Excellency therefore determined to speak with the <HI>Penobscots</HI> on the Day of their Arrival; and accordingly order'd the Delegates to be conducted to him in the Afternoon, to the before-mention'd Place of Conference with the <HI>Norridgwalks.</HI> And, after the usual Salutations,</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Joseph <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> was sworn to interpret truly, what should pass between his Ex∣cellency and the Indians of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe, and Mr. <HI>Ezekiel Price</HI> was sworn to make true Entries of what should pass between his Excellency the Governour and the Indians at this Conference.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007222_0022_102B3FE8F74867A0"/>
Then the Governour spoke to the <HI>Indians,</HI> as follows,</P>
<P><HI>Friends and Brethren of the</HI> Penobscot <HI>Tribe.</HI></P>
<P>'I Hope I meet you in good Health; and that you left your Squas and Papooses and the rest of our Brethron at St. <HI>George's</HI> well.</P>
<P>'In the last Winter I receiv'd a Letter from your Tribe, the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> and <HI>Arss<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gunticooks,</HI> pressing me to come to the Eastern Parts early this Summer in Person, instead of sending Commissioners to you at the usual Time: And in Compliance with your Re∣quest, I am now come here to renew the Covenant between us.'</P>
<P>'The Honourable Colonel <HI>Mascarene,</HI> who is appointed a Commissioner in behalf of the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia;</HI> and the three Honourable Gentlemen on my left Hand, who are appointed Commissioners from <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> are come here likewise to join with me in brightning the Chain.'</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'Upon my Arrival at this Place, I found the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> in whose Name you wrote to me before I left <HI>Boston;</HI> that they expected I should come to St. <HI>George</HI>'s to treat with you and them, and that they could not come to meet me at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> had waited for me here some Days: And I was sorry that I did not find Delegates from your Tribe here likewise, after having come so far to meet you at your own Desire; but have been oblig'd to send another Letter, and wait for you nine Days.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'The Endeavours of your Priest to prevent my sending Commissioners to treat with you the last Fall, and to distribute the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI>'s Presents to you, and raise Jealousies and a Misunderstanding between us then, (of all which I ap∣pris'd you in my Letter by those Commissioners,) leave me no Room to doubt now to whom I am to Impute your late ill Behaviour: But as I am perswaded that it proceeded from his bad Counsel, and not from the genuine Sentiments of your own Hearts, and find by your coming here, that you have consider'd better of the Matter; I shall pass it over, in hopes that you will not offer this Government the like Affront for the future.'</P>
<P>Here the Governour declar'd to them his Intention of sending a Body of Soldiers to the Head of <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, and across the Carrying-Place between that and the River <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diere;</HI> and building Forts upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> in the same Manner that be did to the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians: <HI>And proceeded thus,</HI></P>
<P>'I have communicated all this to our Brethren the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> who are the only Proprietors of all the Lands upon <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, which have not been conveyed and sold by them to the <HI>English;</HI> and they are so well satisfied with the Sincerity of our In∣tentions, and the Uprightness of our Hearts towards them in building this Magazine and strong House upon that River, that they have assur'd me at my late Conference with them, that the <HI>English</HI> are welcome to build Forts upon it, where they please.</P>
<P>'Tho' I well know, <HI>Brethren,</HI> that your Tribe never pretended to own any Lands upon the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> yet as a Proof that I would hide nothing from you, which I have in my Heart to do; I have acquainted you likewise with my Design.'</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'I have been inform'd that a large Number of the <HI>French</HI> Indians will be sent from <HI>Canada</HI> to commit Hostilities against us in the Time of Indian Harvest; and that the <HI>French</HI> have promised to build Forts at <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and the Head of the River St. <HI>Francois,</HI> for the Protection of those <HI>Indians,</HI> who shall be concern'd in it.'</P>
<P>'I have also been inform'd since my Arrival here, that the <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> have sent two Belts of Wampum to your Tribe, desiring that you would join <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the <HI>Canada</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="007222_0023_102B3FEA87B7B928"/>Indians against the <HI>English;</HI> and that there was a Number of <HI>Canada</HI> Indians now at <HI>Penobscot</HI> consulting upon that Matter: Likewise that the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians had sent you a Belt of Wampum to invite you to join with them in falling upon the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>'Also that you have lately sent a Letter to the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> pretending that the <HI>English</HI> are going to take your Lands from you, and desiring the <HI>French</HI> to assist you against them.'</P>
<P>'As I have open'd my Heart to <HI>you,</HI> so I expect that you will not hide from me what you know concerning these Matters.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'In the Letter, which you sent me the last Winter, you express your Satisfaction in Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, and promise to abide by it; and to show you, the <HI>English</HI> Governments are determin'd to stand by it too, we are ready to ratify and confirm it, together with the Treaty of Peace made at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in <HI>Casce Bay,</HI> in 1749: But before we proceed to do that, I think it necessary to hear what you say in Answer to what I have been inform'd of, concerning the Designs of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> their making or erecting Settlements or Forts at <HI>Kennebeck, Penobscot,</HI> or elsewhere within the <HI>English</HI> Territories: And as the Matters I have laid before you require your serious Considera∣tion, I shall wait until to Morrow Morning for your Answer.'</P>
<P><HI>Ausong,</HI> (in behalf of the Indians of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe) addressing himself to his Excellency, said,</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'We, who are present, are fully authoriz'd to represent the Tribe of <HI>Penobscots</HI> at this Conference; and in their Name salute your Excellency, and the Gentlemen, who are with you.'</P>
<P>'We will consider of what your Excellency has now said to us; and, when we meet you in the Morning, will speak to you upon it.'</P>
<P>His Excellency then drank King <HI>GEORGE's</HI> Health; and that Peace mignt con∣tinue between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Penobscots,</HI> which Healths the Indians pledg'd and withdrew.</P>

<HEAD>SATURDAY <HI>July</HI> 6. 1754.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, His Excellency the GOVERNOUR, the Commissioners, &amp;c. and the Indians.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'I Am now ready to hear your Answer to what I said to you Yesterday.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Ausong,</HI> (in Behalf of the Indians of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe,) addressing the Gover∣nour, spoke as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'WE rejoice that we have an Opportunity of seeing you in good Health.</P>
<P>'What your Excellency told us Yesterday concerning the Designs of the <HI>French,</HI> is intirely new to us; — We knew nothing of these Things before.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="007222_0024_102B3FECE7FED0B8"/>
'What we know we will reveal to your Excellency, and open our Hearts freely to you.</P>
<P>'We heard, a Belt of Wampum was sent to the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians; but never heard that any was sent to our Tribe.</P>
<P>'The French have not built, neither are they building any Fort near us, as you have been inform'd: Some of our Tribe went to <HI>Canada</HI> the last Spring, where they were told it was all Peace between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> advised them to keep Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> and do no Mischief.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>'Our Hearts are fix'd on Peace—As we are Friends and Brethren, we desire a clear Path may be kept open between us.</P>
<P>'As you have open'd your Hearts to us, so we will speak freely and inform you of all we know.</P>
<P>'We represent all the Indians as far as <HI>Passamaquody.</HI>'</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'You say some of your Tribe went to <HI>Canada</HI> this Spring, and that they told you it was all Peace, and advis'd you to keep Peace with the <HI>English</HI>—How then came your Priest to tell you it was War, and endeavour to perswade you to fall on the <HI>English?</HI>'</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Here the Indians seem'd to be in a general Surprize at what the Governour said:</HI></P>
<P>After which he proceeded,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'Are you certain, that no Letter was sent from your Tribe to the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> in the Month of <HI>June</HI> last?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ausong:</SPEAKER>
<P>'We can't write ourselves; we gave no orders to the Priest or any other Person to write such a Letter for us, neither do we know of any such Letter's being sent.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'As you say, you know of no such Letter, I believe You; but I must inform you that I have in my Hand the Copy of a Letter, which your Priest wrote in your Name to the Governour of <HI>Canada;</HI> telling him that the <HI>English</HI> had a Design to take your. Lands from you, and desiring you may be assisted from <HI>Canada;</HI> and this Copy is of your Priest's own Hand Writing.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ausong:</SPEAKER>
<P>'I assure your Excellency as I did before, we know nothing concerning this Letter.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'I mention this that you may perceive the Artifices, which your Priest uses, to stir up War between you and us.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ausong:</SPEAKER>
<P>'I am a Man, my Heart is good, and what I now say is true.</P>
<P>'When we were at <HI>Boston,</HI> you told us if any thing bad was like to happen, it should be discover'd to us.</P>
<P>'If the Hatchet was like to be taken up, we would inform you of it—It is our full In∣tention to keep the Path between us open and clear.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'I shall always heartily join with you in keeping the Path free and open.</P>
<P>'The <HI>Norridgwalks</HI> have ratify'd the two Treaties before-mention'd, and if you are ready to do the same; I have Instruments of Ratification prepar'd.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="007222_0025_102B3FEF39E307E0"/>
<SPEAKER>Ausong:</SPEAKER>
<P>'We have always stood by Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, and will never depart from it; and are now willing to Ratify it.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'When you met me at St. <HI>George's</HI> about thirteen Years ago, you brought with you a Counter-part of Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty—What is become of it?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians:</SPEAKER>
<P>'It is lost.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ausong:</SPEAKER>
<P>'I have already told you, the <HI>French</HI> are not building any Forts on our Lands; — You may depend upon it, that what we have said is true.</P>
<P>We are not willing that either the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>English</HI> should build any Forts or make any Settlements upon our River; and we have declar'd to the <HI>French</HI> that they never shall incroach on our Lands.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'If the <HI>French</HI> should ever attempt to make any Incroachments on your Lands, give us Notice of it; and we will come to your Assistance, and help you to drive them off: Your Lands are within King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Territories, and under his Protection.'</P>
</SP>
<P>Then his Excellency order'd the Ratifications of the Treaty made by Lieut. Gover∣nour <HI>Dummer,</HI> and that concluded in 1749, with the Eastern Indians, to be distinctly read and interpreted to the <HI>Penobscots:</HI> Which being done; the Governour ask'd them if they were ready to sign them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians:</SPEAKER>
<P>We are ready.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the same were interchangeably sign'd.</P>
<P><HI>His Excellency then acquainted the Indians of the Law pass'd by this Government forbidding the English to bunt on their Lands; and told them that be would endeavour that every Person who offended against that Act should be punished; and assur'd them that Justice should be done them respecting their Trade in the same Manner as he did to the</HI> Norridgwalks: And then proceeded thus,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'I would speak to you concerning the Behaviour of the <HI>Arssegunticooks.</HI></P>
<P>'By the two Treaties before-mention'd it is agreed, That <Q>if any real or supposed Wrong should happen to be done by the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI> to either Party, no private Revenge should be taken, but Application made to the King's Government to have the same redress'd in a Course of Justice: And it is further engag'd by the Indians; That if any of your Tribes of Indians should break these Treaties, you would join your young Men with ours, and reduce such Indians to Reason.</Q></P>
<P>'The <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians were present the last Year at the Ratification of those Treaties, agreed to them, and receiv'd the Governments Presents.'</P>
<P>Here his Excellency related the Behaviour of the <HI>Arssegunticooks,</HI> in the same Man∣ner as he did to the <HI>Norridgwalk</HI> Indians: <HI>And proceeded,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>'Here are present three Honourable Gentlemen commission'd from the Government of <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> who are come to meet the <HI>Arssegunticook</HI> Indians, in order to have the Mischiefs committed on both Sides amicably redress'd, and to wipe off the Blood that has been spilt; but those <HI>Indians</HI> will not come to meet them.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="007222_0026_102B3FF15B60E170"/>
'Thus you see how these <HI>Indians</HI> have behav'd towards the <HI>English;</HI> and notwithstand∣ing they sign'd the Ratifications of the Treaties afore-mention'd the last Year, and receiv'd the Governments Presents, and join'd with you in desiring me to meet them early this Year to treat with them; yet they refuse to come to meet me: And a Party of that Tribe is now lurking in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who declare they will have further Satisfaction for the Blood of the two Indians kill'd by the English, the Year before last.</P>
<P>Wherefore, to prevent any more Bloodshed, I must now call upon you to join <HI>your</HI> young Men with <HI>ours</HI> in reducing these Indians to Reason.'</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians:</SPEAKER>
<P>'What you say is Right.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'Will you join your young Men with ours; and oblige these Indians to submit to Reason?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians:</SPEAKER>
<P>'We don't like the Behaviour of the <HI>Arssegunticooks;</HI> we will use our utmost Endeavours to prevent these Indians doing any more Mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ausong:</SPEAKER>
<P>'Soon after my return Home I intend to set out for <HI>Canada;</HI> and will then speak to these Indians and perswade them to live in Peace with the English.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOV'R:</SPEAKER>
<P>'I shall depend upon your preventing them from doing any further Mischief; if you do not, I must insist upon your joining your young Men with ours, to reduce them to Reason.</P>
<P>'I have now done speaking.'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ausong:</SPEAKER>
<P>'We thank your Excellency for your kind Treatment of us: It is a great Satisfaction that you have open'd your Heart so freely to us: It will be very grateful to all our Tribe; and we shall endeavour still more and more to keep the Covenant between us inviolable, and preserve the Friendship of the English.'</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the Governour made them the same Offer in Behalf of the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> that he did to the <HI>Norridgwalks,</HI> for maintaining and educating any of their Children which they should send to <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>He acquainted them also, That he should order Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> to give each of the Delegates a Present of the Value of <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> old Tenor, out of the Truck House at St. <HI>George</HI>'s upon their Return thither: As did the Commissioners from the Provin∣ces of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> That they had desir'd Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> to make them a Present of <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> old Tenor a-peice on Behalf of each of their respective Provinces.</P>
<P>The Governour then assur'd them that the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> would make their whole Tribe the annual Present in the Fall, which had been promis'd them upon their maintaining Peace and Friendship with the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>After which the <HI>Indians</HI> desir'd leave to entertain the Governour, and Commissioners and other Gentlemen with a Dance in the Afternoon, which they did.</P>
<P>The Dance being ended, one of the Delegates ask'd the Governour to permit him to bring his Son next Spring to <HI>Boston,</HI> and leave him there for Education: And the Day following two more of them desir'd his Excellency to send them to <HI>Boston</HI> for some Time, all which the Governour granted.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 7th of <HI>July,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> came in Procession from on Board their Sloop to the Meeting-House, and attended Divine Service Morning and Afternoon.</P>
<P>And on Monday the 8th of <HI>July,</HI> set sail to return to St. <HI>George</HI>'s River.</P>
