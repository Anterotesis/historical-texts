<HEAD>TO THE <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT the best People may soon <HI>de∣generate,</HI> is a Truth abundantly evi∣dent from the Cautions, Threat∣nings, and Histories of the Word of GOD, without appealing to the Ex∣perience of all Ages. And that <HI>this People</HI> have sadly done so, cannot but be own'd by every one who knows any thing of <HI>New-England's first Ways,</HI> and has his Mind at all exercis'd to dis∣cern things of this Nature. It is also as evident that GOD hath been <HI>restifying</HI> against our Aposta∣cy, &amp; punishing us therefore, in a <HI>Series</HI> of various &amp; very awful Judgments. Our <HI>first</HI> days, as they were our <HI>best</HI> in respect of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, so also of Prospe∣rity. Our Fathers indeed met with their Trials in their day; their GOD did prove and chatted them: But still He was remarkably present with them; the Hand of his Mercy, and the Arm of his Power, were often made bare, for their Delive∣rance; and <HI>his Salvation was openly shewed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sight of the Heath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. They trusted in him, and were
<PB N="ii" REF="002530_0003_0FDB5DD5972D3658"/>not confounded; they cried to him, &amp; were delivered. He answered them by terrible things in Righteous∣ness</HI> upon their Enemies. They have told us what GOD did for them in their day, in the time of old; and we should speak of it to our Gene∣ration, and to those that shall come after us, that our Fathers GOD may be exalted.</P>
<P>BUT as there has been a visible Alteration in our Carriage to him of later Years, so there has been a signal Change in the Course of his Providence towards us; which may cause us to take up this mournful Lamentation, <HI>Oh that it were with us as in</HI> Years <HI>past, as in the days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God preserved us: When the Candle</HI> of his Providence <HI>shined upon our heads, and by his light we walked thro' darkness!</HI> For tho' there are not wanting many Instances of the underserved Favour of GOD to us, and some gracious An∣swers of Prayer (particularly in the late remar∣kable Successes against the Enemy, and in the return of fruitful Seasons, after a threatning Drought) which it would he a criminal Ingra∣titude and Stupidity in us not to take a thankfull Notice of; yet it must be said. We have not such <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> Appearances of GOD with aim for us, as our Fathers had; and the Tokens of his Displeasure are to be read in deep and fiery Characters: It must be a sleepy, or rather dead Eye, that does not see them, and a hard heart that is not affected with them.</P>
<P>NOW that which GOD expects of us is, That we be HUMBLED, that we FEAR,
<PB N="iii" REF="002530_0004_0FDB5DD71466DEB0"/>and turn our feet to <HI>walk in his Law, and is his St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes, which he has set before us, and before our Fathers. This</HI> is the Call of the present day: Highly reasonable in it self, and of the last Consequence to us: For it is the only likely Way to obtain the Removal of the Judgments, under which we are languishing, and the Return of GOD's Favour to us in which our whole Happiness is bound up. This the Nature of the Duty, the Commands and Promises of GOD in his Word, and the Experiences of the People of GOD do abundantly prove.</P>
<P>AND <HI>this</HI> is what we are call'd to in the fol∣lowing <HI>Discourse;</HI> wherein the Nature of this Duty is plainly and fully described, and, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Motive to it, the fatal Consequence of our In∣corrigibleness under Divine Judgments is awfully represented. The <HI>Lecture Day</HI> before that on which it was deliver'd, was turn'd into a day of solemn <HI>Fasting &amp; Prayer,</HI> particularly on account of the War, and the Drought which was then prevailing: And the Author well Judg'd it pro∣per to follow that day with such a Discourse as this. And I desire heartily to bless GOD who led his Servant into such a Subject, and assisted his Preparations on it; gave the Sermon such Acceptance and Influence in the Delivery, and has inclin'd him to publish it.</P>
<P>IT comes abroad (at the Desire of some pious and well-dispos'd Persons who heard it) just as it was preach'd; without transcribing or altering much: only he has (as he was desir'd) inlarg'd
<PB N="iv" REF="002530_0005_0FDB5DDA7B70F6F8"/>the first <HI>Proposition</HI> under the first <HI>Doctrine,</HI> by adding what he deliver'd some time ago from the same Text on a Fast-day; which has swell'd the Discourse something beyond the Dimensions of a single Sermou. And tho' I know it was not the design of my <HI>dear and worthy Brother,</HI> in asking me to preface this his Sermon, that I should give any <HI>Encomium</HI> of him or his Perfor∣mance, which, (as he does not need it from any one, so) it would not be decent for me to go about; yet I will take the Liberty to say, that as the Subject is important, and very seasonable for this People at this day, so it is handled in such a manner as evidently shews the Breathings of a pious Spirit, and a hearty Concern for the great Interest of this People; and, I think, it cannot fail of being highly acceptable to every true Lover of Religion, and sincere Friend of our <HI>Zien.</HI> And as to my putting a Preface to it, (which some perhaps may think needs an Ex∣cuse) I shall only say, That this my Brother and I, are not only united in the Bonds of Friend∣ship and Intimacy, but in carrying on <HI>alternately</HI> the last Turn in the <HI>Thursday-Lecture:</HI> This made me think with him there would be but a Propriety and Harmony in it, if I submitted to the Desires of Him, and the Publishers, to ac∣company it to the Press with my humble and earn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Prayers to the GOD of all Grace, that He would make these seasonable and pungent Words, <HI>as G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ads, and as Nails fastned by the Masters of Assemb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and given by that one Shep∣herd the Lord Jesus;</HI> that they may stimulate all that shall read them, to the great and neces∣sary
<PB N="v" REF="002530_0006_0FDB5DDB99FEF3F8"/>work of Humiliation and Reformation, which is so loudly called for. For if after all we remain an unhumbled and an unreformed People, what can be expected, but that we should come at last with Horrour to subscribe to the Truth and Dreadfulness of this awful Threat∣ning, <HI>Behold I will set my Face against you for evi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>!</HI> But if we <HI>humble</HI> our selves, and <HI>Fear, and walk in God's Law, Then</HI> may we hope that GOD will <HI>cause his Face to shine upon us, and save us:</HI> That he will <HI>visit us with his Fa∣vour, and make us glad according to the days wherein he has afflicted us, and the Years wherein we have seen evil:</HI> That <HI>we should call, and He would answer us:</HI> That he would be <HI>our Arm every Morning; would arise as a strong Man after new wine, plead our Cause for us, go forth with our Armys, bring us forth out of Darkness into light, set our feet upon a Rock, and put a new Song in our Mouth, even Praises to our God:</HI> That we should <HI>possess this good Land which the Lord gave to our Fathers, and leave it,</HI> with the Advanta∣ges we enjoy in it, Civil and Religious, <HI>as an Inheritance to our Children after us for ever.</HI> To this I would put my humble, and fervent <HI>A MEN.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JER. XLIV. 10, 11.</BIBL>
<P><HI>They are not humbled even unto this day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law, nor in my Statutes, that I set before you &amp; before your Fathers, Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, Be∣hold, I will set my Face against you for Evil</HI>—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">J</SEG>EREMIAH was called early to be a Teacher in <HI>Israel,</HI> an inspired Prophet: And he continu'd long, even from the Days of good <HI>Josiah,</HI> through all the succeeding wicked Reigns, down to the <HI>Jews</HI> Captivity, and for some time after this. He is commonly styled the <HI>weeping</HI> Prophet. He was a mournful Spectator of the Sins and Sorrows of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, then the
<PB N="2" REF="002530_0009_0FDB5DE41B133E70"/>only professing People of God. In his Book of Prophecies we have many melancholy Chapters concerning them; besides the Book of Lamen∣tations, which was (as one calls it) his Elegy upon <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s Funeral. He was sent to warn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acksliding <HI>Israel</HI> of the desolating Judgments, that were coming on them, except they Repent∣ed: And he liv'd to see a great part of his sad Predictions accomplish'd upon them: for the Peo∣ple turned not at his Reproof. As became a faithful Prophet, a Lover of <HI>Zion,</HI> and one jea∣lous for the Lord, he set himself to bear Testi∣mony against the growing Degeneracies of that unhappy Day, and to reform the Corruptions of the Times. How painful were his Endeavours! How fervent his Applications to Conscience! How impartial his Rebukes! How loud and plain his Warnings? How pathetic and moving his Exhortations! A wise, and zealous &amp; powerful Preacher he was. And yet (O how sorrowful the Thought) it seems he had but very <HI>little Success</HI> in his Ministry. He liv'd among a Peo∣ple that <HI>hated to be Reform'd,</HI> and that <HI>would not be heal'd.</HI> Nevertheless the Prophet, in preach∣ing the Word, was <HI>instant in season and out of season; rebuk'd, reprov'd, exhorted with all Long-suffering, and Doctrine.</HI> After <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was made desolate, and the Body of the Nation were carry'd Captive to <HI>Babylon,</HI> He remain'd Prophesying to the small Remnant, that were suffer'd to abide still in the Land. And when this ungrateful wicked Remnant deserted their own Land, and compe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to go down with them into <HI>Egypt;</HI> He still attended the
<PB N="3" REF="002530_0010_0FDB5DE560008CF8"/>Duties of a Prophet, and did the best Services he could for his Countrymen there.</P>
<P>THIS forty fourth Chapter of his Book, out of which I have taken my Text, begins with an awakning Sermon, which <HI>Jeremiah</HI> preach'd to the Jews in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Wherein the Prophet first reminds them of those desolating Judgments, that were brought upon <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and upon themselves. Then he observes to them the procuring Cause of their Miseries, <HI>viz.</HI> Their own Wickedness. In the next place, he puts them in mind of the Warnings they had had, and the Pains that God had taken with them to bring them to Repen∣tance; upbraids them with their former Obsti∣nacy in their own Land, and with the fatal Con∣sequents of it; upbraids them with their conti∣nu'd Impenitency and repeated Idolatries now in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and expostulates with them upon the Un∣reasonableness and Madness of their Conduct; and finally threa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens them with a total De∣struction, for their incurable Stubborness and Impenitence.</P>
<P>MY Text takes in part of the two last Heads. And in it we have a Charge and a Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatning.</P>
<P>First, HERE is a Charge upon the Jews. <HI>They are not humbled, even unto this Day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law.</HI> &amp;c. They were not humbled for their Sins, is they ought to have been, and as God expected; nor afraid of his Judgments; neither did they turn from their evil ways unto God's Test<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>monies, notwithstanding all the Methods used with them to that end. This is the Charge advanc'd against them, the Complaint sighed over them,</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002530_0011_0FDB5DEA22AF16E0"/>
THEN a Threatning follows. <HI>Therefore, thus sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will set my face against you for Evil.</HI> They had set their faces to go into the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> in a daring Contradiction to the revealed Will of GOD, and had hardn'd their faces against GOD, in ways of Rebellion and Wickedness: and therefore GOD will also set his face against Them, in ways of Judgment, to punish them for all their Iniquities.</P>
<P>WHAT may be further needful for the Ex∣planation of the words, may be given in speak∣ing to the Doctrines that I design to treat upon, which are these. (1.) GOD expects it of a Peo∣ple under his Judgments, that they <HI>humble them∣selves,</HI> and <HI>fear,</HI> and <HI>walk in his Law.</HI> (2.) It is sometimes the sad Case of a People under Divine Rebukes that they <HI>continue,</HI> notwith∣standing all, <HI>unhumbled,</HI> and <HI>unreformed.</HI> (3.) GOD <HI>observes their Conduct</HI> under his Judgments, and <HI>marks</HI> against them all their Obstinacy and Im∣penitency. (4.) When a People are finally irre∣clamable, GOD <HI>will set his Face against Them for Evil.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>GOD expects it of a People under his corrective Hand, that they humble themselves, and fear, and turn their Feet unto His Testi∣monies, to walk in his Law.</HI></P>
<P>HERE are Three comprehensive Articles of Duty, which might all be profitably expatiated upon.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002530_0012_0FDB5DEB5AF3B438"/>
PROP. I. <HI>A People under GOD's Judgment's should</HI> humble <HI>Themselves.</HI> The Complaint in our Text, <HI>They have not humbled themselves,</HI> sheweth GOD's Expectation of it from them; and this must be founded upon the strongest Rea∣sons, and the Demands of his own Law. The Call of GOD to an afflicted People runs in such Language as that, Jam. 4.9, 10. <HI>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your Laughter be turned to Mourning, and your Joy to Heaviness. Humble your selves in the sight of God.</HI> It is expresly <HI>required</HI> by many Divine Precepts, that we hum∣ble our selves under GOD's Judgments; which speaks it our indispensable Duty. And then the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> of things bespeak it at out hands. The Calamities we are groaning under, do loudly preach to us of the Power of GOD, of his Holiness and Justice, his Displeasure at us for our Sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are so many grounds and motives of Humiliation. Hence it is but <HI>our reasonable Service,</HI> and a just Comportment with our State and Circumstances. Moreover this will be our <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Interest.</HI> If we are truly humbled, it will dispose us to seek to GOD, and to engage in a saving, thorow, and lasting work of Reformation; and so give ground to hope for, and prepare us to receive the Salva∣tions, which GOD has promis'd to a reforming and repenting People. <HI>GOD will not forget the humble;</HI> the Poor of the Flock shall trust in Him: They shall trust in Him, and <HI>ly down in in Safety.</HI> They shall <HI>rejoice</HI> in the Holy One of Israel, and shall <HI>tread down the Haughty under their feet.</HI> When once a People are brought to
<PB N="6" REF="002530_0013_0FDB5DECEEC9F378"/>humble themselves under GOD's Judgments, it bodes Deliverance, and presages the return of good Times. According to that of the Apostle, 1 Pet. 5.5, 6, 7. <HI>Be clothed with humility: for GOD resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of GOD, that he may exalt you in due time: Casting all your care upon him, for be careth for you.</HI></P>
<P>BUT here the Inquiry arises, <HI>What is that hum∣bling themselves,</HI> which GOD expects from a Peo∣ple under the Rebukes of his Providence. To which I answer, it implies something inward, in the Heart, and somthing external, in the Life.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be consider'd as <HI>internal,</HI> in the Heart; and so it implies many gracious Dispo∣sitions and Actings of Soul. And indeed it is this inward Humiliation, that is principally in∣tended. For GOD looks at the <HI>Heart</HI> chiefly. The Sacrifices of GOD
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 51.17.</NOTE> are a <HI>broken Spirit,</HI> and a <HI>contrite Heart.</HI> To this Man will I look, saith the Lord
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 66.2.</NOTE>, even to him that is <HI>Poor,</HI> &amp; <HI>of a con∣trite Spirit.</HI> The Lord seeth not as Man seeth
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.7.</NOTE>: for Man looketh on the <HI>outward Aspearance,</HI> but the Lord looketh on <HI>the Heart.</HI> And if we be not of a humble <HI>Spirit,</HI> we do not truly humble our selves <HI>in the sight of GOD.</HI> To humble our selves outwardly, and in the fight of <HI>Men</HI> only, will not suffice: we must humble ourselves in the sight of GOD also. The Heart must be humbled: and this includes a variety of religious Frames, &amp; devout Affections; which I shall en∣deavour to sum up in the following heads.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002530_0014_0FDB5DEE53F1AAC8"/>
First, IT implys, as the foundation of it, a deep <HI>Conviction of Guilt,</HI> the fruit of a thorow Self-examination, and impartial Self-judging. Un∣der the Judgments of GOD, it becomes a People to judge themselves. We shou'd search our Hearts, and try our Ways, to find out the pro∣voking Evils, that are the unhappy Grounds of GOD's Controversy with us. GOD expects to hear us inquiring every one, (as in Jer. 8.6.) <HI>What have I done?</HI> We must be very accurate, impar∣tial, and thôrôw in this Inquiry; willing to know the worst of our selves, the most of our guilt. And wherein we have done Iniquity, our <HI>Hearts</HI> must <HI>condemn us,</HI> our Consciences <HI>accuse</HI> us, charge upon us our Sins, and read our Doom to us from the Law of GOD.</P>
<P>IN the next place, being thus convinced and condemn'd in our selves, there must be a deep <HI>Self-abasement, Shame,</HI> &amp; <HI>Remorse</HI> of Conscience, an holy <HI>Indignation</HI> at our selves, and a humble <HI>Submission</HI> to the Will of GOD.</P>
<P>THERE must be a godly <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Self-abase∣ment,</HI> under the sense of our guilt and vileness. As becomes self-condemned Malefactors, we must be filled with Shame, and Confusion, at the re∣membrance of our Faults. When we remember our evil ways, and our doings that have not been good, we must <HI>loath our selves in our own sight</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exo.</HI> 36.31, 32.</NOTE> for our Iniquities, and for our Abominations: and be <HI>ashamed, yea, even confounded</HI> for our own ways. We must not rest in the visible Signs and outward Expressions of shame: but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>inner
<PB N="8" REF="002530_0015_0FDB5DF2F4C268A0"/>Man</HI> must be sutably affected and abash'd; the <HI>Heart</HI> blush; Pride <HI>within</HI> be mortify'd, &amp; every self-exalting Thought subdu'd. Knowing every man the plague of his own Heart, we must be vile in our own eyes, and as <HI>Job</HI> when he said
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Job</HI> 42, 6.</NOTE> <HI>I abbor my self, and repent in dust and ashes.</HI> As <HI>Asaph,</HI> when he said
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 73.22.</NOTE>, <HI>So foolish was I, &amp; ignorant; I was as a Beast before GOD.</HI> And like <HI>Ezra,</HI> when he fell down on his knees, and said
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezr.</HI> 9.5, 6.</NOTE>, <HI>O my GOD, I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my face to Thee, my GOD; for our Iniquities are increased over our head, and our Trespass is grown up unto the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, there must also be a godly <HI>Sor∣row,</HI> and <HI>Remorse</HI> of Conscience; a spirit of holy Mourning, and true Contrition of Heart. This is required. Jer. 2.19. <HI>Know and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy GOD.</HI> And (as it follows, Chap. 6.26.) <HI>Make thee Mourning, as for an only son, most bit∣ter Lamentation.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> after the denial of his Lord, is an Instance of this; of whom it is said, Mat. 26.75. <HI>He went out, and wept bitterly.</HI> And now the Call of GOD to us, to every one of us, is in the words of our Saviour (Luk. 10.37.) <HI>Go, and do thou likewise.</HI> It was prophesy'd of some, Ezek. 7.16. <HI>They shall be like Doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his Iniquity.</HI> The Apostle gives that Charac∣ter of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> (2 Epist. 7.9, &amp;c) <HI>Ye sor∣rowed to Repentance; ye sorrowed after a godly sort. For godly sorrow worketh Repentance unto Salvation
<PB N="9" REF="002530_0016_0FDB5DF458BF3868"/>not to be repented of.</HI> Such penitent Mourners must <HI>we</HI> be, if we wou'd approve our selves truly humbled. Our Sorrow must be inward and un∣feign'd. We must be pricked at the Heart; our Spirits wounded; our Souls melted into peniten∣tial Tears. Joel 2.12, 13. <HI>Now saith the Lord, Turn ye even to Me with all your Heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rent your Heart &amp; not your Garments.</HI> We must afflict our Souls: our Hearts must be rent and broke with a mighty sense of Sin, and as 'twere ground to pieces with a prevaling Sorrow: espe∣cially at a time when we are bewailing not only our own personal Sins, but also the Sins of others and of the Land, our Hearts must indeed be <HI>full.</HI> A great &amp; deep Sorrow becomes us, proportiona∣ble to the grounds and occasions of grief that are before us, and which are (alas) at this day how very plentiful! Very numerous, and great! Yet the mournful Penitent must keep his Resent∣ments and Passions within due Bounds; remem∣bring the Apostle's Caution, 2 Cor. 2.7. <HI>Lest per∣haps such a one should be swallowed up with over∣much Sorrow.</HI> — And as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sorrow must be hearty and deep, so it must be <HI>universal</HI> and <HI>impartial.</HI> Indeed if it have the former Quali∣fications, it will have the latter. We must mourn after this godly sort for <HI>all</HI> our Sins: We must not flatter any favorite Vices in our selves. While we pretend to humble our selves for one Sin, (a Sin, which perhaps thrô satiety, or some evil effects felt, is become grievous and irksome to us) we must not rejoice in another, that is more agreeable to our Humour, or appears
<PB N="10" REF="002530_0017_0FDB5DF91DC6F490"/>to be more for our worldly Advantage; as it may be the manner of some is. No, but we must repent of <HI>all</HI> our Sins, without any excepti∣on. Our Hearts must be broken for, and broken off from our most beloved Lusts. — And as there must be no Partiality, with reference to our own Sins, so neither as to the Sins of <HI>Others.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Each (says one) must mourn the Sins common to all; and the gross Trespasses of each sort must be bewailed by every sort.</Q> Ezek. 9.5. <HI>Set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</HI> We must bewail all the Sins of our Fa∣milys; all the Sins of the Town and Land we live in, and of the Nation we belong to. No consideration of Interest may bias us to tenderness in any point, to spare any particular Sin, and except it out of our Lamentations. No pretend∣ed Reverence to our Fore-fathers, or to the Cha∣racters of our Rulers or Ministers; no regard to the Interest of any sort of Men, or to the Fashi∣on &amp; Custom of the multitude, nor fondness for a Party, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ought to have any Influence in the matter. We must not <HI>cover</HI> the Sins of others, any more than our own. No sinister Views, no private Affections, or the like, may lessen our Re∣sentment of their Miscarriages, or dispose us to palliate, and excuse, or extenuate them. Hear in what strains the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> bewails the publick Guilt. Dan. 9, 7, 8. <HI>O Lord, Righteous∣ness belongeth unto Thee: but unto us Confusion of face, as at this day! to the Men of Judah, and to the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel that are near, and that are afar off: to our Kings,
<PB N="11" REF="002530_0018_0FDB5DFB2ACDB7C8"/>to our Princes, and to our Fathers; because we have sinned against Thee.</HI></P>
<P>AND now in consequence of this Shame and Sorrow for Sin, there must be an holy <HI>Indignati∣on</HI> at ourselves. We must conceive a Displea∣sure at our selves, like the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Penitents, in whom the Apostle commends this Self Indig∣nation as a fruit and argument of their godly Sorrow. 2 Cor. 7.11. <HI>Behold, this self-same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of your selves; yea, what Indignation; — yea, what Revenge!</HI> If we are truly penitent, our Hearts will be hot within us, in resentment of our Follies: a holy, Anger at our selves will kindle in our Breasts, and Conscience will stir up it self to scourge and smite us.</P>
<P>FURTHER MORE, where there is a true Hu∣miliation under GOD's Hand, there will be a chearful <HI>Submission</HI> to his Will in all the afflictive Dispensations that befall us. This is made one sign and character of a due Humiliation, Lev. 26.41. <HI>If then their uncircumcised Hearts be humb∣led, and they then accept of the Punishment of their Iniquity; then will I remember my Covenant with Ja∣cob. &amp;c.</HI> So Lam. 3.27, &amp;c. <HI>It is good for a Man, that he hear the yoke in his youth. He sitteth alone, and keepeth silence, because he hath born it upon him. He putteth his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be Hope.</HI> Ezek. 16.63. <HI>That thou may∣est remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more; because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou bast done, saith the Lord.</HI> We must never open our mouths
<PB N="12" REF="002530_0019_0FDB5DFCDA51D2D0"/>in any way of Murmuring or Complaint. We must not stout and brave it against GOD; nor exalt our selves against the Lord, and despise his Chastnings, and strive with our Maker; as they did, of whom we read, Isa. 9.9, 10. They <HI>say in the pride and stoutness of heart. The Bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars.</HI> Far from us be such a Spirit and Carriage. The Temper &amp; Conduct of holy <HI>Job</HI> becomes us in all our Afflictions, who said (Chap. 40.4.) <HI>Behold, I am vile! What shall I answer Thee? I will lay my hand upon my Mouth.</HI> So the Psalmist said (Psal. 39.9) <HI>I was dumb; I opened not my mouth: because Thou didst it.</HI></P>
<P>AND as there must be a meek &amp; patient Sub∣mission to GOD under all his dealings with us; so where there is this, there will (and ought to) be <HI>a thankful Notice</HI> taken of the <HI>Mercies</HI> mixed with Divine Judgments and a due sense of our own Unworthiness. That will be the humble disposition and Language of our Souls, Ezr. 9.13 <HI>After all that is come upon us, for our evil Deeds, Thou our God hast punished us less than our Iniquities deserve.</HI> And (Gen. 32.10.) <HI>I am not worthy of the least of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou bast shewed unto thy servant.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, there will also be the exercise of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> in GOD, through Jesus Christ, for the Pardon of Sin, the removal of the Grounds of GOD's Controversy with us, and putting a happy Period unto it. The humble Centurion had great Faith, Mat. 8.8. <HI>Lord, I am not wor∣thy that thou shouldest come under my Roof: but
<PB N="13" REF="002530_0020_0FDB5E01163B73B8"/>speak the Word only, and my Servant shall be heal∣ed.</HI> So had holy <HI>Job,</HI> who said, (Chap. 13.15, 16.) <HI>Though He stay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before Him. He also shall be my Salvation: for an Hypocrite shall not come before Him.</HI> We read of some who said, Ezr. 10.2. <HI>We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the People of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</HI> We must not mourn, in any case, as they that have no Hope: thô perplexed, yet not be in Despair. It is good that a Man should both hope and qui∣etly wait for the Salvation of GOD. Trust in the Lord at all times, O ye People, pour out your Hearts before Him: GOD is a Refuge for us, through Jesus Christ. Fly for refuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before you. Isa. 50.10. <HI>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obey∣eth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, &amp; stay upon his God.</HI> Thus said the Church of old, Isa. 26.8. <HI>In the way of thy Judgments, O Lord, have we waited for Thee.</HI> So the Prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> in the Church's Name, Chap. 7.7, 8, 9. <HI>Therefore I will look unto the Lord: I will wait for the God of my Salvation: my God will hear me. Re∣joyce not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will hear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he ylead my cause, and execute Judgment for me: I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will bring me forth to the sight, and I shall be∣bold his righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002530_0021_0FDB5E0295ABCE48"/>
THUS I have mention'd some of those <HI>inward Affections</HI> and Graces which are imply'd in the Humiliation requir'd. We must thus put on humbleness of <HI>Mind. Our Souls</HI> must be humbled within us. Unless we have such gracious Tem∣pers reigning in us, it may be complained of us, as of him of old (Dan. 5.22, 23.) <HI>Thou hast not humbled thy HEART: And the GOD, in whose bands thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.</HI></P>
<P>But further,</P>
<P N="2">2. IT implys something <HI>External, in the Life, and Actions:</HI> Outward Expressions agr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealde to our inward Impressions.</P>
<P>THUS, It implys proper Acts of <HI>Mortification</HI> and <HI>Self denial.</HI> There must be a kind of pious Self-revenge, and Self-affliction for Sin. We must inflict proper Severities upon our selves, in a way of just Correction for our follies. I do not here mean any such absurd Discipline, as the <HI>Popish</HI> Penances, the going on a Pilgrimage, the macerating our Flesh unreasonably, the mutila∣ting, wounding, or whipping of our Bodys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet I mean a treating our Bodys (the Instru∣ments of Sin) with something of Austerity, as well as an afflicting our Souls by a more spiritual and rational Discipline. We must labour to cru∣cify the Flesh, to mortify the Members that are upon the Earth, that the Body of Sin may be destroy'd, that hence forth we may not serve Sin. We must endeavour to pluck out the right eye, and to cut off the right hand; must deny our selves, and take up our Cross; abridge our selves of many lawful Gratifications, as well as of
<PB N="15" REF="002530_0022_0FDB5E076BE1A098"/>all sinful Extravagances. The Apostle commends such a Conduct in the <HI>Corinithians</HI> (among other things) as a fruit and argument of their true Repentance. Forecited 2 Cor. 7.11. <HI>Behold, this self-same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what Carefulness it wrought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you; yea, what In∣dignation; yea, what Zeal; yea, what Revenge!</HI> They took a holy Revenge on themselves for their Sins, by agreeable acts of Discipline. So shou'd we on our selves by solemn Fastings and Watchings, and by a daily course of Abstinence, Self denials, and Mortifications. In a time of public Judgments, if a People wou'd humble themselves aright, it becomes them to observe many solemn Days of Fasting and Humiliation. That is the Call of GOD to them, Joel 1.14. <HI>Sanctisy ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your GOD, and cry unto the Lord.</HI> And as it follows in the next Chapter, <HI>Turn to the Lord with all your Heart, and with Fasting, &amp; with Weeping, and with Mourning.</HI> Thus <HI>Josiah</HI> humbled himself, 2 Chron. 34.27. <HI>Thine Heart was tender, and thou didst humble thy self before GOD, and didst rend thy clothes and weep be∣fore me.</HI> So we read of <HI>Ninevites,</HI> (Jon. 3.5, 6.) <HI>So the people of Nineveh believed GOD, and pro∣claimed a fast, and put on sackloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackloth, and sat in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes.</HI> And besides these extraordinary Mortifications, there should be more common and continued Self-denials, in
<PB N="16" REF="002530_0023_0FDB5E0A209650D0"/>general practice among such a People. In the day of Trouble we thou'd deny our selves in the use of many lawful Liberties; retrench our un∣necestary expences; and lay aside our Gallan∣try; cloth our selves with Humility, and be modest and lowly in our whole Appearance. Surely it very ill becomes a <HI>Poor</HI> and an <HI>Afflicted</HI> People to affect Gaiery &amp; Pomp in their Apparel, Luxury at their Tables, Mirth and Jollity, and great Delicacy of Living, or the like. Hear how the Prophet complains of and rebukes this in GOD's People of old, Isa. 22.12, 13. <HI>In that day did the Lord GOD of Hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dness, and to girding with sackcloth: and behold, joy &amp; gladness slay∣ing oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drink∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine.</HI> Against all such we have that solemn <HI>Wo</HI> denounc'd, (Amos 6.) <HI>Wo to them that are at ease in Zion, — that lie upon Beds of Ivory, &amp; stretch themsetues upon their Couches, and eat the. Lambs out of the Flock, and the Calves out of the Stall; that chant to the sound of the Viol; that drink Wine in Bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief Oyntments: but they are not grieved for the Affliction of Joseph.</HI></P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, the Humiliation requir'd implies a due <HI>Confession</HI> of our Sins to GOD. There must be a most hearty Confession of Sin, in all the Instances, and in all the Aggravations of it; an open and ingenuous and full Acknow∣ledgement of our Offenses unto GOD. This is every where in Scripture represented as the Duty of an afflicted People, and the Property of self∣judging Penitents. Lev. 26.40, 41. <HI>If they shall
<PB N="17" REF="002530_0024_0FDB5E0BECE74CE0"/>confess their Iniquity, and the Iniquity of their Fa∣thers; if then their uncircumcised Hearts be hun∣bled, — Then will I remember my Coveno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> &amp;c. Thus <HI>Ezra confessed,</HI> weeping, and casting him∣self down before the house of God
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezra</HI> 10.1.</NOTE>. So <HI>Daniel</HI> made <HI>confession of his sin, and of the sin of his peo∣ple,</HI> when he set himself to seek by Prayer with Fasting, for the holy Mountain of his God
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan</HI> 9.20.</NOTE>. So we read of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neb.</HI> 9.2.</NOTE>, when they assembled themselves with Fasting, <HI>they stood and confessed their Sins, and the Iniquities of their Fa∣thers.</HI> Thus shou'd <HI>we</HI> confess our Sins to God, and shou'd do it with the deepest Humility and Incurvation of Mind.</P>
<P>AGAIN, There must be an express <HI>Justifying</HI> of GOD's Providence in all that befals us. Thus we read of some, 2 Chron. 12 6. <HI>They humbled themselves, and said, The Lord is rightecus.</HI> We must acknowledge to GOD our utter Unworthi∣ness of the least Mercy at his Hands, and sub∣scribe to the Justice of his Proceedings with us, in any Punishments already inflicted, or that he may see meet to bring upon us. That must be our humble Language, (in the Words of some of GOD's People of old,
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Isel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Neh</HI> 9.33. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra</HI> 9.15. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.7.</NOTE>) <HI>If Thou, Lord, shouldest mark Iniquities, O Lord, who should stand! Thou art just in all that is brought upon us: for Thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: O Lord God of Israel, Thou art rightcous: behold, we are before Thee in our Trespasses; for we cannot stand before Thee, because of this. O Lord, Righteousness be∣longeth
<PB N="18" REF="002530_0025_0FDB5E0D18266F20"/>unto Thee; but unto us Confusion of Faces, as at this day.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, there must be much &amp; servent <HI>Prayer.</HI> This is the natural Effect of a due Hu∣miliation. Thus we read of <HI>Manasseb,</HI> 2 Chron. 33.12. <HI>When he was in affliction, be besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his Fathers.</HI> So the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psal. 35.13. <HI>I humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer re∣turned into mine own bosom.</HI> When we humble our selves to GOD, we shou'd <HI>seek his Face;</HI> de∣precate the Continuance of his His Frowns, and intreat the Return of his Favours. We must seek Reconciliation with GOD; casting our selves down at his feet, and from the Dust crying to him for pardoning Mercy, and Deliverance. That is the Direction given us, Hos. 14.2. <HI>Take with you Words, and turn to the Lord, and say unto Him, Take away all Iniquity, and receive us graci∣ously.</HI> We must pray as the Church of old did,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isai.</HI> 33.2.63.15.64.5. <HI>&amp;c. Deut.</HI> 9.26, <HI>&amp;c. Jer.</HI> 14.7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>O Lord, be gracious unto us; we have waited for Thee: be Thou our Arm every morning, our Salva∣tion also in the time of trouble. Look down from Heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy Holi∣ness and of thy Glory: where is thy Zeal and thy Strength, the sounding of thy Bowels, and of thy Mercies towards us? Are they restrained? Behold, Thou art wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th: for we have sinned. But now, O Lord, Thou art our Father: we are the Clay, and Thou our Potter, and we are all the work of thine Hand. Be not wroth very sore, neither remember iniquity
<PB N="19" REF="002530_0026_0FDB5E1124FCF6B0"/>for ever. O Lord God, destroy not thy People, and thine Inberitance. Look not unto the stubborness of this People, nor to their Wickedness, nor to their Sin. O Lord, though our Iniquities testisy against us, do Thou it for Thy Name sake. O the Hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Why should∣est Thou be as a Stranger in the Land? Why shouldest Thou be as a Man astonied; as a mighty Man that cannot save? Yet Thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and we are called by Thy Name: Leave us not. Host Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath Thy Soul loathed Zion? Why hast Thou switten us, and there is no Healing for us? We acknowledge, O Lord, our Wickedness. But do not abbor us, for Thy Names sake, do not disgrace the Throne of Thy Glory. Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles that can</HI> save us! <HI>Art not Thou He O Lord our God? Therefore we will wait upon Thee</HI> —. In such strains as these (the most devout &amp; fervent) did the Prophets &amp; People of GOD in old time call upon GOD in their days of Trouble. And these Prayers were put on Record for the Use and Imitation of succeeding Ages. Jam. 5.10 &amp; 13. <HI>Take, my Brethren, the Prophets, for an Example —. Is any among you afflicted? Let him Pray.</HI> Psal. 50.15. <HI>Call upon Me in the day of Trouble; I will de∣liver</HI> —. When we humble our selves to GOD, we must call upon Him: and we may do it with a holy Confidence, in the Name of CHRIST. We must improve the Mediator in all our Addresses to Heaven, and bring Him in the arms of our Faith; holding Him up as the expiatory Sacri∣fice, and pleading the Atonement of His Blood, which is sufficient both for the Priesthood &amp; for
<PB N="20" REF="002530_0027_0FDB5E12B9AFD280"/>the Congregation. <HI>Let us therefore come boldly un∣to the Thron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Grace,</HI> that we may obtain Mer∣cy, and find Grace to help in time of need. (<HI>Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 16.) And let us continue in Prayer. Isai. 62.6, 7. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence; And give Him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</HI></P>
<P>IN fine, The Humiliation requir'd, implys a fincere <HI>Consecration of our selves to God,</HI> &amp; solemn <HI>Vows</HI> of <HI>Reformation</HI> &amp; Obedience for the future. Surely it is meet to be said unto God, <HI>I will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end any more: if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more,</HI> (Job 34.31, 32.) That is the genuine Language of an <HI>Ephraim</HI> bemoaning himself,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hos.</HI> 14.8.</NOTE>, <HI>What have I any more to do with Idols!</HI> That is the proper Language of backsliding Children humbling themselves
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 3.22. <HI>Isai.</HI> 26.13.33.22. <HI>Psal</HI> 80 18.</NOTE>, <HI>Behold, we come unto Thee: for Thou art the Lord our God. O Lord my God, other lords besides Thee have bad dominion over us: but by Thee only will we make mention of thy Name. For the Lord is our Judge, The Lord is our Law∣giver, The Lord is our King. — We will not go back from Thee: quicken us, and we will call upon Thy Name.</HI> Thus the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be a resolute renouncing of Sin, and dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng our selves to GOD. We must cast away e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry Idol of Jealously; and al∣low of no Competitor with GOD, nor seek to any other Saviour, nor own any other Lord. We must yield our selves to GOD, and joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant. Thus we read how the People of <HI>Judah</HI> in <HI>Asa</HI>'s time, when humbling themselves for their Sins, <HI>They entred
<PB N="21" REF="002530_0028_0FDB5E13EB381A28"/>into a Covenant to Jeek the Lord God of their Fa∣thers, with all their Heart &amp; with all their Soul; and they sware unto the Lord; and all Judah rejoy∣ced at the Oath; for they had sworn with all their beart, and sought Him with their whole desire,</HI> (2 Chron. 15.12 —.) So in <HI>Nebemiah</HI>'s time, we read, that the People, and the Priests, and the Nobles <HI>entred into a Curse, and into an Oath,</HI> to walk in GOD's Law, and to observe all the Com∣mandments of the Lord their God, <HI>Neb.</HI> 10.29.</P>
<P>THUS I have confider'd the Nature &amp; Manner of a People's <HI>humbling</HI> themselves, under the Judg∣ments of GOD; which was the first Thing. I shall be shorter in speaking to the other two Ar∣ticles. Pass we now to the next.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>A People under Divine Judgments should Fear.</HI> They shou'd fear GOD, and tremble at his <HI>Judgments,</HI> and be afraid of Sin, the procu∣ring Cause. Sometimes <HI>Fear</HI> is put for Religious Worship, and sometimes for the whole of Reli∣gion. But as it stands in the Text, I think it is to be taken for that <HI>Passion</HI> of the mind, called <HI>Fear.</HI> There shou'd be a holy <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> and <HI>his Wrath;</HI> a Trembling at his Judgments, and a follicitous Care to obtain his Favour. We read, Psal. 65.8. <HI>They that dwell in the uttermost Parts, are afraid at thy T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kens.</HI> The Psalmist said, <HI>My flesh trembleth for Fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments,</HI> (Psal. 119.120.) So the Prophet, (Hab. 3.16.) <HI>When I heard, my Belly trembled: I trem∣bled in my self, that I might rest in the day of Trou∣ble.</HI> <Q>We shou'd stand trembling before GOD under the apprehension of present &amp; impending
<PB N="22" REF="002530_0029_0FDB5E158A5EBD48"/>Dispensations of his Wrath: but more especial∣ly under the sense of whatsoever provoking evils have kindled the Lord's Displeasure, and made Him threaten a Departure from us.</Q> Ezra 9.4. <HI>Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the Transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the Evening-sacrifice.</HI> So, Chap. 10.9. <HI>All the People sat in the Street of the House of God,</HI> trembling <HI>because of this matter.</HI> The Apostle mentions this as one thing in his Description of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> Repentance; fore∣mention'd, 2 Cor. 7.11. <HI>Behold, this self same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, What carefulness it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of your selves,</HI> (that is, What concern &amp; endeavour to get ac∣quitted from the guilt of Sin, and to escape the Judgments of GOD) <HI>Tea, what Indignation</HI> at your selves; <HI>yea, what Fear,</HI> what an awe of GOD, what a Reverence of his Majesty, and Dread of his Wrath! Such a Fear is one Cause &amp; Fruit of Humiliation. In the Prophet's description of the true Penitent, these two Characters are joyned, <HI>Isai.</HI> 66.2. To this Man will I look (saith the Lord) even to Him that is <HI>poor and of a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my Word.</HI> If there be in us a humbling Sense of our Provocations, there will be also an awaken'd sense &amp; trembling Ap∣prehension of the dreadful Wrath of GOD hang∣ing over our guilty Heads. Moreover there will be a Fear of <HI>Sin;</HI> a Caution &amp; Self-jealousy; a Distrust of our own Hearts, a sense of their Trea∣chery, and a dread of turning again unto Folly; of relapsing into those Sins, which have been the occasion of so much forrow &amp; anguish to us.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002530_0030_0FDB5E158C364820"/>
SUCH a Fear there ought to be in us at all times, and particularly under the Divine Judge∣ments. Isai. 8.13. <HI>Sanctify the Lord of Hosts Him∣self, and let Him he your Fear, and let Him be your Dread.</HI> Where there is a due Humiliation, there will be this godly Fear: and where there is such a Humiliation &amp; Fear, there will be the last thing in the Text, as the Effect thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> Reforma∣tion &amp; Obedience. But this brings me to the other Proposition.</P>
<P>PROP. III. A People under the Divine Judg∣ments, should <HI>turn their Feet unto God's Testimo∣nies, to walk in His Law.</HI> In the day of Adverfity we shou'd consider: Confider GOD, and be afraid: consider our selves, and be abased: consider our ways, and repent: consider GOD's Statutes, and turn our feet unto His Testimonies: consider our professed Humiliation, and bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance; for saking the Sins we pretend a shame and sorrow for: consider the Vows we make in the time of our Distress, and set our selves daily to perform them: consider the Calls of Providence, and hear the Rod, and turn at GOD's Reproof; who chastens us for our Profit, that we may be made Partakers of His Holiness, and who expects that we be reformed by these Things. If we are indeed humbled, this will be one speedy and visible Effect. Where there is a broken Heart, there will be a reformed Life.
<Q>Reformation and Obedience (faith an Ex∣positor
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Poul's</HI> Annot.</NOTE> on the Place) are the first fruits of true Humiliation. GOD accounteth those not
<PB N="24" REF="002530_0031_0FDB5E1AE8024388"/>humbled, but <HI>herdned,</HI> who are not reform'd, and become obedient to His Will; let their pretended Attrition, or Contrition be in out∣ward appearance what it will.</Q> This is the <HI>Repentance</HI> GOD calls for, even a thorow and universal Change of Heart and Life. This is the <HI>Fast,</HI> which He hath chosen
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 58.6.</NOTE>, to loose the bands of Wickedness, — to turn from our evil ways, to make our Doings good, and to walk in His Law. The <HI>Fear</HI> of the Lord is to depart from Evil: and this is the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, that we keep His Commandments. — Deut. 10.12. <HI>And now Israel, What doth the Lord thy GOD require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy GOD, to walk in all his ways, and to love Him, and to serve the Lord thy GOD with all thy heart, and with all thy soul?</HI> So Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk hum∣bly with thy GOD?</HI> This is what GOD calls us to by his Judgments: and the Promise of Salvation is suspended on this Condition, 2 Chro. 7.14. <HI>If my People which are called by my Name, shall</HI> humble <HI>themselves, and pray &amp; seek my Face,</HI> and turn from their wicked Ways; <HI>then I will hear from Heaven, &amp; will forgive their Sin, and will beal their Land.</HI></P>
<P>WE see then what is the Duty and Business of the <HI>present Day.</HI> We in this Place &amp; Land are an afflicted People, groaning under a variety of awful Judgments. And from the Premisses, we may learn what Tempers and Deportments
<PB N="25" REF="002530_0032_0FDB5E1C1C7C6B60"/>do become our Condition. Surely it becomes us to be a <HI>self-humbling,</HI> a <HI>trembling,</HI> and a <HI>reforming</HI> People. O that we may be found such! Let us every one personally humble our selves, and fear, &amp; reform and be obedient. And then in our several places lay out our selves to promote such a Disposition and Conduct in all about us. This wou'd be a sure Token for Good, and afford the most defirable Prognostick of a happy Change of Times approaching. Blessed be GOD, the GOD of all grace, that there are found among us a number of such as tremble at his Word, and at his Judgments, Men of a humble and contrire Spirit, Men of Prayer, and Men of a holy Con∣versation. These surely are the Strength and Security, the Riches and Beauty of the Land. The Lord add to them daily, and make them a thousand times so many more as they are! The Lord revive his work! <HI>Help, Lord, for the Faith∣ful fail!</HI>— Tis to be fear'd such Persons are but thin sown among us, and the number continual∣ly lessening: and that this People in general have the Complaint in our Text too deservedly lying against them, — <HI>Ye have not humbled your selves, even to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day,</HI> neither have ye feared, nor walked in GOD's Law. — But this leads me to another Observation from the Text.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>IT is sometimes the sad Case of a of Divine Judgments; but remain secure, un∣humbled, and unreform'd notwithstanding all.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Jews</HI> in our Text had met with a long Train of very desolating Judgments; but yet all was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little to make them weary of
<PB N="26" REF="002530_0033_0FDB5E1DA42547D8"/>Sin, and willing to turn to GOD. They <HI>wou'd not</HI> be reform'd by these things, but did still go on in their Trespasses, and walk contrary to GOD. And this is the sad State and Case of many <HI>others</HI> in the World, besides the Jews. It is often the just Character and Reproach of a people now, as well as then, that they do not humble themselves, and fear and walk in GOD's Law, altho' he visits their Iniquities upon them, and brings them low by one Judgment after ano∣ther. Judgments rather harden, than melt them. All the methods of Discipline are lost upon them. They will not receive Correction. They will not be instructed; they will not hear the Rod; but stop their Ears, &amp; refuse to return.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES they are <HI>Stupid</HI> under the Tokens of GOD's Displeasure, and remain <HI>in∣sensible</HI> under all the means us'd to awaken them out of their spiritual Slun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Epiraim</HI> is a Cake not turned: strangers have de∣voured his strength, and he knoweth it not; Yea, gray Hairs are sprinkled upon h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet <HI>he knoweth it not.</HI> The Stork in the Heavens knoweth her appointed Times: but <HI>Israel doth not know the Judgment of the Lord.</HI> GOD pour∣eth on them the fory of his Anger, and the strength of Battel; and it setteth them on fire round about, yet they <HI>know it not;</HI> and it burn∣eth them, yet they <HI>lay it not to Heart.</HI> His Hand is lifted up, but they <HI>will not see.</HI> They are a foolish People, and without understanding, which have eyes, and <HI>see not;</HI> which have ears, and <HI>hear not.</HI> A revolting and rebellious Heart have they, even a Heart of <HI>Stone,</HI> that will not relent
<PB N="27" REF="002530_0034_0FDB5E2248070208"/>and they harden their faces as a Rock. Are they ashamed, when they commit Abomination? Nay, <HI>they are not at all ashamed, neither can they blush.</HI> They are <HI>Brass &amp; iron,</HI> Yea, as the very <HI>Adam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt.</HI></P>
<P>OP if they be not thus altogether insensible, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey are <HI>unsubdu'd</HI> and <HI>inflexible,</HI> very <HI>re∣solute,</HI> and <HI>mad on their L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts,</HI> even as the un∣tam'd Horse, or unbroken Mule, that hath no Understanding. They reject the Counfil of GOD against themselves; and say in the Pride of their hearts, like those (in our Context) who said unto <HI>Jeremiah, As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not beark∣en unto Thee: but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our mouth.</HI> Or they say in their Despair, <HI>There is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>MANY times they proudly <HI>assert their own Innocence,</HI> against all the Convictions offer'd them: They will not see and own their Ini∣quity. They call Evil Good, and Good Evil, and put Darkness for Light, and Light for Dark∣ness: or deny the Charge of Guilt, and stand upon their own Vindication. Thus our Lord reproved the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> Luk. 16.15. <HI>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justifie your selves before men; but GOD knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of GOD.</HI> Many times it is the unhappy Case of a People, that every particular Person shifts off the Blame from him∣self, and imputes the Cause of Divine Judgments to the Sins of others, and so looks on himself as unconcern'd in the Calls to Repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002530_0035_0FDB5E239AD6D1B0"/>
MANY times they <HI>Scoff</HI> at <HI>GOD's Messen∣gers,</HI> and laugh at their solemn Rebukes and Warni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and turn all into Banter and Ridi∣cule. We read of <HI>Scornful Men</HI> that ruled in Jerusalem, who made Lies their refuge. So we r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad of the <HI>Jews,</HI> They <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocked the Messengers of GOD, &amp; despised his Words.</HI> And again we read, <HI>They laughed them to scorn, &amp; mecked them.</HI> Thus the Pharisees <HI>derided</HI> our Saviour's Counfils and Admonitions: and so the Athenians <HI>mecked,</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> rebuk'd their Superstition, and warn'd them of a future Judgment.</P>
<P>MANY times they <HI>murmur</HI> at the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD, and are <HI>enrag'd</HI> at their <HI>Reprovers,</HI> and can't beat the Means that are us'd to bring them to Repentance. Under the Divine Chastnings they charge GOD foolishly, and complain as if his ways were not equal. Their Hearts rise against GOD, and are hot within them. They rage and fret themselves, as Bullocks unac∣customed to the Yoke. And they hate him that rebuketh in the gate. They can't endure to be told of their Sins. They spurn at Reproofs, and fly in the face of such as deal plainly withthem, and abbor him that speaketh uprightly. They are a rebellious People, lying Children. Chil∣dren that will not hear the Law of the Lord: which say to the Seers, see not; and to the Pro∣phets, Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y not unto us right things, speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to us smooth things, Prophesy Deceits: Leave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your present Course of preaching: Trouble us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o more with harsh Rebukes, and terrible T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nings. — Many times this is the Lan∣guage of Sinner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. They would fain stop the
<PB N="29" REF="002530_0036_0FDB5E252FB800E0"/>mouths of their faithful Monitors, and put out the Eyes of their watchful Seers. They love Darkness rather than Light, because their Deeds are evil. Their Hearts are fully set in them to do Evil, and they go on frowardly in the ways of their own Eyes. And if any one stand in their way, to check them in their wild Career, they take it heinously. They say to their Re∣provers, <HI>Get you out of the way,</HI> and let us alone. Sometimes they banter, and scorn, and deride them. Sometimes they brow-beat, and hector, and revile them, They lift their Horn on high, and speak with a stiff Neck. They swell and rage, they huff and threaten. <HI>Amaziah</HI> is an In∣stance of this; who being reproved by a Pro∣phet, it came to pass as he talked with him, that the King said unto him, <HI>Art thou made of the King's Counsel? Forbear; Why shouldest thou be smitten?</HI> (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 25.16.) And sometimes they proceed to Persecution and Violence. Thus wicked <HI>Ahab</HI> took <HI>Micaiah,</HI> (who had prophesy'd Evil of him) and put him in Prison, there to be fed with Bread of Affliction, and with water of Affliction. And good <HI>Asa</HI> himself was once wroth with <HI>Hanani</HI> the Seer, for reproving him, and he put him in a Prison-house; for he was in a Rage with him, because of this thing. And thus the <HI>Jews</HI> devised Devices against <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and smote him with the Tongue, and digged a Pit for his Soul, and hid Snares for his Feet.</P>
<P>THESE are some of the <HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Fruits</HI> of an unhumbled Spirit &amp; rebellious Heart: which are too often visible among a People under Di∣vine
<PB N="30" REF="002530_0037_0FDB5E269ABD17C0"/>Judgments. Sometimes such evil and ma∣lignant Tempers reign among them, and are al∣most epidemical. This shows the greatest Con∣tumacy &amp; Incorrigibleness. Where this is the Case, they are truly &amp; emphatically a stiffnecked Generation, a crooked and perverse Nation.</P>
<P>BUT this is not <HI>always</HI> the Case even where a People may be said to be unhumbled. Some∣times there may not appear such a proud, passi∣onate, impatient, inflexible Spirit among a Peo∣ple under Divine Judgments, and yet they may be unsubdu'd and impenitent. Sometimes Sin∣ners are pretty patient of Reproofs from <HI>men:</HI> they do not mock, or rage, and brave it as others do, but give their Ear modestly and calmly: yet they go on still in their own way. Some∣they patiently bear <HI>Divine</HI> Rebukes. Under Afflictive Providences they are quiet and silent, and seemingly penitent: but still nothing is re∣formed. Or it may be some Reformation is pro∣duced, and Humiliation pretended; yet not∣withstanding it may be truly said of them, <HI>They are not humbled, neither have they feared.</HI> They may be said to humble themselves, in no better sense, than it is affirmed of <HI>Ahab,</HI> who fasted, &amp; lay in sackloth, &amp; went softly; and yet <HI>the Statutes of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri were kept still,</HI> and none of the Sins forsaken, for which all that mourning was pretended. In their Affliction, they per∣haps keep days of Fasting and Prayer, and call solemn Assemblies, to seek GOD, and to hum∣ble themselves in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t: but still they are not humbled. They do not fast aright; they don't fast to GOD, even unto Him. GOD is
<PB N="31" REF="002530_0038_0FDB5E2AB1C950C8"/>near in their mouth, but far from their Reins. They inquire with a false Heart, and all their Humiliations are but Pageantty and Pretence. They make a specious shew (it may be) of Self-abasement, of Mortification, and Devotion, but the Reality is wanting. They put on a demure Countenance, disfigure their Faces, and hang down their heads as a Bulruth (for a day,) they lie down in their shame, and spread Sackloth and Ashes under them: They have a Flow of Affections, and cover the Alta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Tears, and pour out their Prayers with a seem∣ing Ardour, causing their voice to be heard on high. They make heavy Complaints of the Wickedness of the Times, and make very plen∣tiful Confessions of their own Sins, together with very solemn Protestations of Repentance: they plight their Vows to GOD, and make Re∣solutions of Amendment for time to come. They ask of Him the Ordinance of Justice as a Nation that loved Righteousness, and forsook not the Ordinance of their GOD. —. And yet after all, there is nothing but the thin shadow of a Fast; nothing but the empty Appearance of Humiliati∣on; nothing but the bare Promise of Reformation. Their profuse Tears dry up, and all their seeming Devotion soon expires, as a vapour: They for∣get their Vows, and turn from the holy Com∣mandment. Sin revives; unmortify<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Lusts awake in them; by which they are enticed and overcome. Thus it happens to them according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his own Vomit again; and, The Sow that was wash∣ed, to her wallowing in the Mire. So the
<PB N="32" REF="002530_0039_0FDB5E2D574D2620"/>Apostle complains of some among the Primiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christians, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.22. And thus GOD oft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> complain'd of the <HI>Jews</HI> of old.

<P>NOW, is this sometimes the Case of a Peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under GOD's Judgments? Let it then put upon <HI>Inquiring</HI> into our Case.

It is an Inquiry of vast Concernment to us: and therefore we shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in good carnest examine our selves.

<P>But thus much for the second Note.</P>
<P>DOCT. III. GOD observes <HI>a People's Conduct under his Judgments, and</HI> marks <HI>against them all their Obstinacy and Stubb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rness.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is imply'd in the Complaint, which he makes in our Text, — <HI>They have not humbled themselves, neither have they feared,</HI> &amp;c. And this Note may be confirm'd from another passage in the Prophecy. Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 8.6. <HI>I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his Wickedness.</HI> So, Job 32.27. <HI>GOD looketh up∣on Men,</HI> (when they have done amiss, and are under his Chast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) to hear, <HI>if any say, I have finned.</HI> He diligen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y observes all Mankind, and their several Carring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, especially in Affliction &amp; Distress. His Eyes run to and fro, in the Earth, beholding the Evil and the Good. His Eyes are open on all the ways of Man. He compasses our Path; He trys our Hearts, and weighs our Actions. He observes Men's Conduct at all times, in all places, and under all his dealings with them. Particularly, he observes how they carry it under his <HI>Rod;</HI> what their Tempers and De∣portments are; whether they are duly humbled
<PB N="34" REF="002530_0041_0FDB5E30A112C430"/>for their Sins; whether they are afraid of his Judgments; whether they turn from their evil Doings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He takes notice if they neglect these things. If they are impenitent, obstinate, and irreclaimable, he marks it against them. He critically observes this Misconduct in a People in general, and in every Person in particular. His Eye is upon every one of whatever Rank, Age, or Condition; taking an exact notice of their Thoughts, Words, and Actions under his Afflicting Hand, &amp; noting all down in His Book of Remembrance.</P>
<P>NOW this <HI>O servation</HI> is in order to <HI>Judgment</HI> upon their Conduct, and the suting GOD's fur∣ther Dispensations to their Case. For He does not act therein as a careless, indifferent Specta∣tor of Human Affairs, but as the Lord &amp; Judge of the World. Hence we read, Jer. 17.10. <HI>I the Lord search the Heart, I try the Reins, even to give to every man according to his ways, and accord∣ing to the fruit of his doings.</HI> The Lord is a GOD of Judgment. He is righteous in all his ways, and all his Works are done in Wisdom. He concerts the best methods for managing his Pro∣vidential Government, and be ordinarily observes a Rule in his Dispensations towards a People. Infinite Wisdom and Justice proportions the Pu∣nishment to the Provocation, so that commonly a People's Sufferings are greater or lesser accord∣ing to the kind and degree of their Sins. Now in order to this, a right Judgment must be pas∣sed on Men: and to this an accurate Inspecti∣on of them is necessary. Hence GOD is repre∣sented as taking the most critical observation of
<PB N="35" REF="002530_0042_0FDB5E31D3CB17C8"/>us. His Eyes behold and His Eye-lids try the Children of Men.</P>
<P>AND is it thus! <HI>How watchful then shou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be over ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves at all times?</HI> Particularly in a day of <HI>Adversity,</HI> how ought we to consider our ways, to ponder the path of our Feet, and take heed to our selves; giving diligence lest any man fail of the grace of GOD; walking cir∣cumspectly, not as Fools, but as Wise; redeem∣ing the time, because the days are evil: laying to heart the Judgments of GOD, and studying to improve them to our Repentance and Refor∣mation; afraid of further Judgments, unto which Impenitency will expose us!</P>
<P>BUT this leads me to the last Observation from the Text, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. IV. <HI>WHEN a People are finally obstinate and irr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clamable, GOD will set his face against them for Evil.</HI></P>
<P>SO stands the Threatning in our Text. They are not humbled, even to this day: <HI>Therefore saith the Lord, Behold, I will set my face against you for Evil.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. GOD will <HI>set His Face against them.</HI> It imply's Resentment and Displeasure in the su∣perlative degree. GOD will turn away his Favour from such a People, and His Jealousy will burn against them. His Soul will depart from them. His Soul will lothe them, neither will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spare, neither will he repent. He that made them, will have no Mercy upon them; and he that form'd them, will shew them no
<PB N="36" REF="002530_0043_0FDB13A5EE98E4E0"/>Favour. He will cast them off; cast them out of his Sight; cast them away from his Presence. He will withdraw his directing and protecting Presence, and no more be their Guide or Guard: his sanctifying Presence, and will take away his holy Spirit from them: his Symbolical Presence (in the end) and will take away his Kingdom from among them, remove their Candlestick out of its place, and put out their Light in obscure Darkness.</P>
<P>HE will l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th their Persons, and turn to be their Adversary. He will reject all their pre∣tended Services, and cast them back as filth in their faces. Their New moons &amp; their Sabbaths his Soul will have: and when they spread forth their hands, He will hide his Eyes from them, Yea, when they make many Prayers. He will not hear. When they fast, He will not re∣gard them, and when they offer an Oblation, He will not accept them; for he remembreth their Iniquity, that they loved to wander, and would not return from their ways; They refused to hearken, and pulled away the Shoul∣der, and stopped their Ears that they should not hear. Yea, they made their hearts as an Ada∣mant-Stone, lest they shou'd hear the Law: there∣fore it is now come to pass, that as GOD cried, and they would not hear; so when they cry, He will not hear. He will cover himself with a Cloud, that their Prayer should not pass thorow. He will not regard their Affliction, but in anger will shut up his tender mercies, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e favourable no more. Nay, He will laugh at their Calamity, and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k when their Fear cometh.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="002530_0044_0FDB5E371F15BF98"/>
2. HE will set his Face against them <HI>for Evil.</HI> He will not only withdraw his Favour from them, but will pour out his Indignation upon them. He will not only reject their Prayers, and deny them an Answer of <HI>Peace:</HI> but will answer them in <HI>terrible things</HI> by Righteousness. His Heart is turned from them, &amp; his Presence gone, which is the Safety and Happiness, the Strength and Glory of a People. His Face is set against them, and Wo to them that are in such a Case. Who knoweth the power of his Anger? It is a fear∣ful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD. When GOD is angry with a People, &amp; cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth his Fury to rest on them, all manner of Evils will break in upon them, as a Flood, or as a consuming Fire. When GOD sets his face against a People, &amp; forsakes them, Iniquity will abound more and more, until Wrath comes upon them to the uttermost. Their misery will be great upon them; and the very Blessings that may be spared to them for a while, will be turn'd into Curses, and become a Snare to them.</P>
<P>IF a People are finally impenitent, GOD <HI>will</HI> thus set his face against them for Evil. He may bear long with them, but he will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear al∣ways. He is a GOD gracious, and longsuffering: but if his Patience be abus'd, and his Grace turned into wantonness, it will kindle his Anger,' &amp; he will punish at last. If a professing People forsake the Lord, then he will turn, and will do them Hurt, after that he has done them Good; and if they finally forsake GOD, He will be angry with them till he consume them ut∣terly.</P>

THAT GOD <HI>will</HI> thus set his Face against a People for Evil, if they are obstinately impeni∣tent, <HI>appears</HI> from the many awful <HI>Threatnings</HI> in the Word of Truth. Thus 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, be will be sound of you; but if ye for∣sake him, be will forsake you.</HI> How plain and peremptory and solemn are those Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in the Twenty sixth Chapter of <HI>Leviti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> where GOD says to his People, —
<Q>It ye will not hearken unto me, but will break my Covenant, <HI>I also will do this unto you,</HI> I will appoint over you Terror, Consumption, and the burning Ague: and <HI>I will set my Face against you</HI> and ye shall be slain before your Enemies. And if ye will not yet for all this hearken to me, then will I punish you <HI>seven times more</HI> for your Sins: and I will break the Pride of your Power; and I will make your Heaven as Iron, and your Earth as Brass, and your Land shall not yield her Increase. And if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring <HI>seven times m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> Plagues up∣on you, according to your Sins, and will send wild Beasts among you, which shall rob you of your Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me, then <HI>will I also walk contrary unto you,</HI> and will punish you <HI>yet</HI> seven times for your Sins, and I will bring the Sword up∣on you, that shall avenge the Quarrel of my Covenant: I will send the Pestilence among you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me,
<PB N="39" REF="002530_0046_0FDB5E3D77C06A48"/>then <HI>I also will walk contrary</HI> unto you in <HI>Fury;</HI> and I, even I, will chastise you <HI>seven times</HI> for your Sins. And <HI>my Soul shall abbor you,</HI> and I will make your Cities wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and bring your Sanctuaries into Desolation, and I will not smell the Savour of your sweet Odours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Thus GOD threaten'd the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation of old. And in like manner he threaten'd <HI>Israel's</HI> evil <HI>Neighbours,</HI> the Heathen Nations bordering upon <HI>Judea,</HI> as in Jer. 12.17. <HI>If they will not diligently learn the Ways of my People to swear by my Name, I will utterly pluck up, and destroy that Nation, saith the Lord.</HI> And it seems to be a standing Law of his Providential Government, that, Jer. 18.9, 10. <HI>At what time I shall speak concerning a Nation, or a Kingdom, to build and to plant it: If it do Evil in my sight, that it obey not my Voice, then I will repent of the Good wherewith I said I would benefit them.</HI> And a like Text we have relating to Gospel-times, Isa. 60.12. <HI>The Nation and King∣dom that Will not serve Thee</HI> [or will not submit to Christ's Sceptre] <HI>shall be utterly wasted.</HI> — Now GOD is <HI>true,</HI> that hath thus threatned. <HI>Hath He said it, and will He not do it?</HI> Yea surely; tho' the Sentence be not speedily execu∣ted, yet it shall not always be delay'd. Tho' He be slow to Anger, yet He will be true to His Threatnings, and not one Iota of them shall fail.</P>
<P>WE may confirm this Argument from the many known <HI>Examples</HI> of Divine Vengeance. There have been sad and lamentable Instances of a People's being ruin'd by their Iniquity, and Provoking GOD to Anger, till He has set his
<PB N="40" REF="002530_0047_0FDB5E3E98BF1158"/>face against them to destroy them. Many Citys and Countries, that were once lifted up to Heaven, have long since been bro't into Desola∣tion for their Sins. Great <HI>Babylon,</HI> which in its day, was the wonder of the World, the glory of Kingdoms, has long since been totally and ir∣recoverably destroy'd, as when GOD over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rew Sodom &amp; Gomorrha. So <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that was the Beauty of <HI>Jadea</HI> &amp; the Joy of the whole Earth, The place which GOD once chose for his Ha∣bitation, where he had his Temple; and whi∣ther the Tribes went up, the Tribes of the Lord unto the Testimony of <HI>Israel;</HI> where were set Thrones of Judgment, the Thrones of the House of <HI>David;</HI> within whose walls were Peace, and Prosperity in all her Palaces; a Place (if any ever in the world) lift up to Heaven; yet even this place is long ago sunk down to Hell, laid desolate, bury'd and lost. The Jewish Nation, for crucifying the Lord of Glory, were rejected of GOD from being any more his People, and their City, and Land made an utter Desolation. And the like Fate has befallen many places fince, that in the early ages of Christianity were flourishing &amp; populous. Many famous <HI>Churches,</HI> that were once the beauty and glory of the <HI>Christian</HI> World, are long since for their Apostasy and Impenitence, reduced to Shame and Ruin; become the Habitations of Cruelty, the Seats of Barbarity, &amp; Idolatry, &amp; are pin'd away in their Iniquitys. — Now these <HI>Examples</HI> do read loud Lectures to us upon our <HI>Text,</HI> and afford clear Conviction of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rine before us. And we may expect that GOD will <HI>deal alike</HI> with <HI>others</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="002530_0048_0FDB5E454A112600"/>that are <HI>alike guilty.</HI> For GOD seems to have one Rule of dealing with a professing People, and the Measures of Providence are usually the same. Indeed, He reserves a Sovereign Liberty to Him∣self, as to the Circumstances of his Dispensations, in which there is often a Variety. Some have gentler discipline than others; some have a lon∣ger space to repent, than others, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> However, in the general, there is one stated Rule, according to which GOD in his Providence impartially pro∣ceeds, especially with a professing People. Hence He sends backsliding <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to self-ruin'd <HI>Shi∣loh,</HI> to view his Judgments there upon his rebel∣lious People; and puts them in mind of the Ruin of the <HI>Ten Tribes:</HI> that by comparing Cases, they might draw proper Conclusions for their own In∣struction and Conviction. As we have it, Jer. 7.12—15. <HI>Go ye unto my place, which was in</HI> Shiloh, <HI>where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my people Israel. And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, — Therefore will I do unto</HI> you— <HI>as I have done to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</HI>—All these Judgments <HI>hap∣pen'd to them for Ensamples:</HI> And the Record of them was made for <HI>our Learning and Admonition,</HI> upon whom the Ends of the World are come. As one saith, <Q>GOD writes his severe Truths with the <HI>Blood</HI> of his disobedient Subjects, and makes their ruinous Heaps to proclaim Knowledge and Counsil to the rest of the World. <HI>Sodom's</HI> Ashes, <HI>Shiloh's</HI> Fire, <HI>Jerusalem's</HI> Desolation, are Uses of Instruction &amp; Warning to all the Inhabi∣tants
<PB N="42" REF="002530_0049_0FDB5E4639EA6E68"/>of the Earth.</Q> <HI>They</HI> fell by their Iniquity, and such as tread in their wicked steps, may expect to fall by the like Judgments. <Q>For GOD is uniform, and of a piece with Himself in his ju∣dicial Proceedings. 'Tis a Rule of Justice, <HI>Ut Parium par sit Ratio;</HI></Q> That the equally guilty shou'd be punish'd alike. Luk. 13.3. <HI>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, as to the <HI>Reasons</HI> and Foundations of GOD's judicial proceedings with any People, especially a professing People, they seem to be very clear &amp; obvious. The <HI>Honour</HI> of his own Name calls for such a Conduct towards an impe∣nitent People. His Glory is especially concern'd in the matter; the Glory of his Holiness, and of his Faithfulness, and Wisdom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He seems bound in Honour to those Attributes, to witness against the Apostacys of his People, by inflicting Judgments upon them. Otherwise His Name will peculiarly suffer by their Wickedness and Impenitence. Hence He tells Israel of old, Amos 3.2. <HI>You only have I known of all the Families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your ini∣quities.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, The Honour of Divine <HI>Justice</HI> re∣quires the punishing a sinful People, and destroy∣ing them, if finally impenitent. Will not the Judge of all the Earth do right? Is there any Iniquity with GOD? Will he not render to every Man according to his Work? And to every Peo∣ple according to the fruit of their Doings? Verily He will render a Reward to the Proud. There is no Unrighteousness in Him. As He is oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in Justice, He will not let a rebellious People goun∣punish'd.
<PB N="43" REF="002530_0050_0FDB5E4796A65AE8"/>Indeed as to <HI>Individuals</HI> or particular Persons, there may possibly be some Exceptions, during the present State: Some Sinners may have almost all their Punishment reserv'd to the future World: But if we consider Men as united in <HI>Society,</HI> and making up distinct Provinces, Kingdoms and Nations, we shall find the Con∣duct of God's Providence towards them is vastly different in this particular. <HI>National Guilts in∣fer National Judgments.</HI> God exercises a Go∣vernment over Men, as they coalesce into distinct Communities Psal. 22.28. <HI>For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the governour among the nati∣ons.</HI> And his Government is infinitely wise, and good, and just, and holy. He governs them by Law and Rule: And He judges them according to their doings. Now methinks, we must have very odd notions of Things, if we imagine that human <HI>Societies,</HI> as such, have any reference to the future State, or can be judged in another World. Hence, if ever God punish them, it must be in the present State. Divine Justice seems more concern'd then to punish <HI>Nations,</HI> than <HI>Per∣sons,</HI> in the Life that now is.</P>
<P>GOD <HI>can</HI> punish whole Nations as easily as particular Persons. He has National Judgments; Punishments of a publick Aspect and general Con∣cern. And if a People fin, they lay themselves open to such Judgments. And if they are finally impenitent, Divine Justice calls a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oud for their utter Destruction. When a People are obstinate and irreclamable, after a long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of Trial and much waiting upon them, God represents him∣self as weary with repenting, and oblig'd to pro∣ceed
<PB N="44" REF="002530_0051_0FDB5F1993A64600"/>to their Destruction. Jer. 15.5, 6. <HI>For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee: I am weary with repenting.</HI>—He may <HI>very justly</HI> do so. For exceeding aggravated is the Provocation that such a People offer unto God; very great the Affronts they put upon Him. It is the highest Instance of <HI>Stubborness</HI> and Rebellion against God, to be incorrigible, and unhumbled, under very humbling Dispensations, and not afraid of the Consequence. It is in effect a <HI>bidding Defiance</HI> to God, a challenging his Vengeance to do it's ut∣most. 'Tis the highest <HI>Insolence</HI> and Contempt of God, and must needs be extremely provoking to Him. He may well therefore set his Face against such a Rebellious People. Shall not God visit such a Nation as this?</P>
<P>MOREOVER, It <HI>defeats the Design</HI> of Provi∣dence, in afflictive Dispensations. The great End ordinarily is to bring a People to Repentance: and for this purpose, Divine Judgments are or∣dinarily for a long while temper'd with much Mercy, that by the Goodness of God we may be led to Repentance. It his method to try a Peo∣ple by less and lighter Judgments at first; and if these are ineffectual, he brings greater and hea∣vier. And if after all they will walk contrary to God, and will not be reformed by these Things, but defeat his gracious Design by a persevering Impenitence; how reasonably, how justly may his abused Patience turn into flaming Indignation?
<PB N="45" REF="002530_0052_0FDB5E4D199679E0"/>His Anger may well burn against them, and his Fury be pour'd out like Fire, to consume them ut∣terly! <HI>When a People have out-stood all the Me∣thods of Reformation, they are completely ripe for Ruin.</HI> They have fill'd up the measure of their Iniquity: they have provoked GOD to the last de∣gree. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should he not set his Face against them for Evil, to cut them off, and to make an utter End Shall not my Soul be avenged on such a Nation as this, saith the Lord. Behold I am against Thee; I will make thee vile, and will Set thee as a Gazing-Stock. I am weary with repenting. I will surely destroy thee; neither will I repent any more, nor shall mine Eye spare Thee, faith the Lord.</P>
<P>BUT now to <HI>apply</HI> this Doctrine in a few Hims.</P>
<P>USE 1. <HI>THIS affords a sad</HI> Progn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stick <HI>to a People that have</HI> long <HI>continu'd</HI> Impenitent <HI>under a Course of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ictive Dispensations.</HI></P>
<P>IT tells us, They are like to have the blessed GOD set his Face against them. If they are re∣solv'd upon Sinning, He is resolv'd upon Punish∣ing. GOD is jealous, and the Lord revengeth: the Lord will take Vengeance on his Adversaries, and He reserveth Wrath for his Enemies. Tho' He be slow to Anger; yet He will not at all acquit the Wicked. How miserable then are a People, secure and stupid under many Judgments, like to be in the Issue! They must expect the Con∣tinuance and Aggravation of their Calamities. There's no prospect of any Period to their Trou∣bles; unless GOD is pleas'd to have done striving with them: and that is the most
<PB N="46" REF="002530_0053_0FDB5E4E5A2EC628"/>formidable Judgment in the World. Indeed sometimes Sovereign Divine Grace is exalted and triumphs in the Conversion of a Person or a Peo∣ple, after they have long stood it out against all means. Isai. 57.17, 18. <HI>I was wroth &amp; smote him; I hid me and was wroth: and be went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him.</HI> But this is an extraordinary Case. If we consider the common Course of Providence, and the constant Tenour of the Covenant, They both (with united voices) read Lectures of Ter∣ror, and speak sadly, to such a People. From hence <HI>We</HI> may learn, <HI>What we have to fear,</HI> if we do not repent, and turn to GOD. We have sin∣ned: and GOD hath a Controversy with us: Tho' hitherto he has dealt very tenderly &amp; com∣passionately with us; in wrath remembring Mer∣cy. But if we go on still in our Trespasses, we must expect GOD will heap on us more severe and heavy Judgments, than ever yet we have felt. We may expect fearful Tragedies to be acted on the Stage, before GOD has performed His work, whether it be of Mercy or of Vengeance.</P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>WHAT has been said may help to ac∣count for those dark Appearances of Providence, wherein GOD seems to be setting his Face a∣gainst this People, at this day.</HI></P>
<P>WE are fallen by our Iniquity: GOD has visi∣ted our Sins upon us from time to time, by Scar∣city, by epidemical Sicknesses, by War in our Borders, Piracies at Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By various Judgments we have many times been brought low. And how are our common Calamities grown &amp; aggravated
<PB N="47" REF="002530_0054_0FDB5E4FD735B238"/>at this day! It is in many respects a time of <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Trouble. It is particularly a day of <HI>Battel &amp; War,</HI> wherein we are frequently made to bleed by the Sword of the Wilderness: and a scorching season, wherein GOD is with-holding the <HI>Rain</HI> of Hea∣ven, and making the Rain of our Land powder and dust. Our distress &amp; perplexity is great on these accounts, and others. And GOD seems to be threatning us with greater Calamities. The pre∣sent Aspects of Providence upon us in our most important Interests, how frowning are they! Above all the too sensible Withdraw of the Spirit of GOD from among us, affords the most awful Symptom, that GOD is setting his Face against us.</P>
<P>AND what is the ground of all? Why, <HI>because we are not humbled, even to this day.</HI> The People turneth not to Him that smiteth them: and therefore his Anger is not turned away, but his Hand is stretched out still; notwithstanding the many days of Humiliation we have solemnized. I desire to lay my hand on my own Breast in the first place: but suffer me to say, Doubtless we have <HI>in general</HI> too much reason to condemn our selves, as the faulty Causes of our own Distresses: It is because we are still unreform'd, that GOD will not put an End to his Controversy with us.</P>
<P>USE 3. <HI>LET us see &amp; admire the Patience of GOD towards us in this Land.</HI></P>
<P>O the Riches of the Patience, &amp; Forbearance of GOD; who, tho' He has not suffer'd us to go unpunisht, yet has <HI>debated with us in measure,</HI> and <HI>stay'd his Rough Wind</HI> in the day of the East Wind.
<PB N="48" REF="002530_0055_0FDB5E54C754E078"/>A great many Mercies have been mingled with his Judgments. He hath not rewarded us accor∣ding to our Iniquities. He hath not in anger shut up his Bowels, but is long-suffering to us∣ward, not willing that we should perish, but that all should come to Repentance. Indeed He is awfully contending with us by various Judg∣ments, avenging the Quarrel of his violated Co∣venant; and is making progress in his Contro∣versy with us: yet He takes but very slow Steps, and makes many Pauses, giving us a <HI>Space to re∣pent,</HI> and <HI>waiting to be gracious.</HI> Surely He is a GOD slow to Anger, long-suffering, and abundant in Goodness &amp; Mercy. Surely it is of the Lord's Mercy, that we are not consumed. O let us re∣alize the Divine Lenity &amp; Forbearance towards us, and give to GOD the Glory of his infinite Patience.</P>
<P>USE 4. WHAT has been said <HI>warns us to beware of continu'd Impenitency, and calls upon us to humble our selves in the sight of GOD,</HI> lest He be provoked to abandon us utterly.</P>
<P>RETURN thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not cause my Anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep Anger for ever. Turn, O backsliding Children! Circumcise your Hearts to the Lord, lest my Fury come forth like Fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the Evil of your Doings, saith the Lord. Be ye not stiff-necked, but yield your selves unto GOD, that the Fierce∣ness of his Wrath may turn away from you. He will not turn away his Face, if ye return unto
<PB N="49" REF="002530_0056_0FDB5E5755404308"/>Him. He will not hide Himself for ever. O Je∣rusalem, wash thine Heart from Wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. <HI>How long shall thy vain Thoughts lodge within thee? How long wilt thou refuse to humble thy self before me,</HI> saith the Lord. How long will this People provoke Me? Do they provoke Me to Anger, saith the Lord! Do they not provoke themselves <HI>to the Confusion of their own Faces!</HI> Do ye provoke the Lord to Jealousy! Are ye stronger than He! O foolish People, and unwise! Shall Briars and Thorns be set in array against devouring Fire! Verily He is a jealous GOD, with whom we have to do, and He is a strong Lord. Who knoweth the power of his Wrath? Who can stand before Him, when once He is angry? Why then should we incense him yet more, by a persevering Im∣penitency! He is jealous for <HI>his great Name,</HI> which is <HI>pecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iarly</HI> concern'd in <HI>our</HI> Conduct, and in the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner of His Dealings with <HI>us.</HI> And He will have <HI>Honour</HI> from us, in our <HI>Repentance,</HI> or in our <HI>Ruin.</HI> He has been for many Years witnessing against our Apostasies, and trying of us, by more mild Exercises of his Rod. But if we continue unhumbled, we must expect more severe and terrible Dispensations of his Wrath. O why then should we any longer harden our Hearts! Have we not smarted enough already! Why should we oblige Him to inflict heavier Judgments upon us! O let us not be so egre∣giously foolish! Remember, Divine Cor∣rections are ordinarily <HI>Progressive,</HI> and do com∣monly rise in proportion to a Peoples Guilt.
<PB N="50" REF="002530_0057_0FDB5E58F92597C8"/>And should we not tremble then to think of go∣ing on still in our Provocations▪ Verily GOD hath not yet done with us. He hath not shot all his Arrows yet: the worst are still behind: and <HI>there seems to be a sharp and terrible one at this day upon the String!</HI></P>
<P>O let us then fall down at GOD's feet, and humble our selves, and cry mightily to Him, and turn every one from his evil way. Who can tell if GOD will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we perish not! O let us not dare GOD, and force him to take more rigorous Methods with us. It is high time for us to awake out of our carnal Sleep; to look about us, and see if there is any way to escape, that we be not consumed. O let us make Hast, and not delay; but as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts. Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my Soul de∣part from Thee; lest I make thee desolate, a Land not inhabited. Who is He that will love Life, and see good Days? Let him eschew Evil, and do Good. For the Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his Ears are open unto their Prayers: but <HI>the Face of the LORD is against them that do Evil.</HI></P>
