<Q>— And be that winneth Souls is Wise.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE great Creator, and Former of all Things, was pleased at first to distinguish his Goodness to Man be∣yond all other Creatures upon Earth, in making and forming a Soul with∣in him, endowed with such noble Powers and Faculties as gave him a Rank among Beings but little lower than that of Angels; in giving him Dominion over the Creatures of the lower World, and crowning him with Glory and Honour; and that more especially by giving him that Knowledge, Rectitude, and Purity of Nature, by which he came to be in the Image and after the Likeness of GOD himself.—Moreover GOD planted a Garden, and placed him in it, where he might en∣tertain himself in the most delightful Manner, re∣galing every Sense with the most delicious Fruits of
<PB N="2" REF="004111_0004_1003B5AF4FCBCED8"/>
divine Bounty, and entertaining his Soul with the most pleasing Contemplations upon the wonderful Works of GOD, and the sweetest Intercourse and Communion with him. And to crown all there was a Tree of Life, of which, if he had maintained his In∣nocence, he might have eaten and lived forever.</P>
<P>But the Devil that subtle Serpent, envious of the Happiness of Man, and desirous to betray him into the same Condemnation and Misery with himself, did, by his cunning and false Suggestions, draw him into Sin, whereby he at once undid himself, defaced the Image and forfeited the Favour of his GOD; was turned out of Paradise, debar'd the Tree of Life, and exposed to Death and Ruin forever.</P>
<P>And this would have been the inevitable Fate of humane Nature, had not GOD of his infinite Mercy interposed for our Salvation and Recovery, by pro∣viding and sending One mighty to Save, and so com∣ing upon new Terms in a gracious Covenant, revea∣led and propounded to us in his Gospel.</P>
<P>And now altho' the Covenant that GOD has esta∣blished with Men in the Blood of his own Son, is full of Grace, and every thing in it may be looked upon as meer Grace; yet alass! such Corruption, Stupidity, and Madness is there in the Hearts of Men, since the primitive Apostacy, that there is nothing more difficult than to perswade Men to forsake their Sins, which lead down to the Chambers of Death and Destruction, and to comply with the most graci∣ous and reasonable Terms of Salvation.</P>
<P>The Devil (as it should seem) found no great Difficulty in seducing and perswading our first Parents to sin: And so to destroy themselves at first, but now it requires the utmost Skill and Wisdom to perswade Men to turn from their evil Ways and live. And all of it will be insufficient unless GOD sets in
<PB N="3" REF="004111_0005_1003D368C9CEE8F8"/>
with his almighty Grace. I say unless GOD sets in with his Grace; for although it be the Spirit of GOD that wins and gains a Soul over to himself, <HI>working in him both to will and to do of his good pleasure,</HI> yet it is, at least for the most Part, by setting in, concur∣ring, and co-operating with the outward Means that he has appointed for that End, such as his Word and Ordinances, especially the Ministry thereof, by a certain Order of Men, that he has all along employed for that Service. I mean the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gos∣pel, whose great Business it is to shew Men the Way to Salvation, and to perswade them to come into it.</P>
<P>And although one would think <HI>this</HI> the easiest Thing in Nature, and that the bare proposing the Thing to rational Creatures would be sufficient, yet daily Experience sadly convinces of the contrary, and that there is no Affair that Men are called to be concerned in, that requires greater Skill or Wisdom in the Management of it; and this is what the wise Man intimates to us in my Text, <HI>And be that winneth Souls is Wise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He that winneth,</HI> or taketh <HI>Souls</HI> with that Skill and Industry as a Fowler taketh a Bird, for so (as Ex∣positors observe) the Word imports. But although it be the same Word, yet here is the difference, both in the Design and in the Event of the thing. The Fowler uses his Art to deceive the innocent Bird, to decoy and draw her into a Snare, when she knows not that it is for her Life: Whereas the winning, or taking Souls, is the using an innocent and honest Art to undeceive Men, to perswade a guilty Soul out of the Snare of the Devil, and a State of Sin and Death, into a State of Pardon, and Grace, and eternal Life; and so if they are taken or caught, it is not with Guile or to their Hurt, to their Death and Destruction, like the Bird, but to Salvation and Happiness Ac∣cordingly
<PB N="4" REF="004111_0006_1003D36DB19D2C00"/>
a Soul thus taken is <HI>won,</HI> is gained, is saved. And now says the Preacher he that thus takes, and wins, and gains Souls is <HI>Wise.</HI> That is either,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1 st. It is a Point of Wisdom to employ our Time and Strength in winning Souls.</HI> It is a great and noble Design to win <HI>Souls,</HI> to gain and save precious and immortal <HI>Souls.</HI> There is nothing in which Men can lay out their Time, their Skill, and all their Powers to better Purpose, than in winning lost Souls, rescu∣ing them out of the Hands of Satan their grand Ad∣versary, and in bringing them over to Christ, and into the Way of Salvation and Happiness. It is the best Work that Men can set themselves about; and consequently he is a wise Man, that diligently, and in good earnest, lays himself out herein. Or,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> If we read the Text as some do, <HI>viz. be that is wise winneth Souls,</HI> then by being wise we may un∣derstand, <HI>being spiritually wise, or truly religious,</HI> and so make the Meaning of it to be, that he that is truly religious winneth Souls. And it is an undoub∣ted Truth that a Man of eminent Piety and Religion, does a great deal towards winning and perswading others over to the Love and Practice of it. And thus some make the latter Part of the Verse to corre∣spond with the former; <HI>the Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life:</HI> That is, the Fruits of Righteousness, which the righteous Man produces in his Life and Conversation, is like a Tree of Life to himself, as it nourishes and preserves his spiritual, and secures his e∣ternal Life: And it is a Tree of Life to others, as it greatly contributes to the Support and Nourishment of a spiritual Life in them, animating and encoura∣ging them to the Imitation of them in all the Fruits of Righteousness. <HI>And be that is wise winneth Souls,</HI> that is, He that is thus righteous or spiritually wise, wins upon others and gains them over to the Love and Practice of the same things.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004111_0007_1003D373696A99A0"/>But then, <HI>3dly. He that winneth Souls is wise,</HI> may be understood thus; He that winneth Souls shews him∣self to be wise, for he must needs be wise that can win and gain Souls; it requires a great deal of Wisdom to do it. They that would win Souls need Wisdom to know how to deal with them, and there is nothing in which their Wisdom appears more conspicuous.</P>
<P>And here, although I may take Notice of the two foregoing Senses of the Text as they fall in my Way, yet, I shall, upon this Occasion, more especially in∣sist upon the last. Accordingly this is the Doctrine for our present Meditation, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That it requires a great deal of Skill and Wisdom to win Souls.</HI></P>
<P>And for the illustrating and confirming this Doc∣trine I shall endeavour to shew,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I.<HI>What we are to understand by winning Souls.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II.<HI>That Souls must be won, wrought upon, and gained over to Christ; and not compelled or forced against their Wills.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III.<HI>That altho' GOD, by his almighty Spirit, wins Souls, yet that it is every Man's Duty to use his Endeavours to win one another over to Christ; and that he commits it to some as their special and pe∣culiar Business, even the Ministers of the Gospel.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV.<HI>Sbew that this is an Affair that requires a great deal of Wisdom and Skill in the Management of it.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. I am to shew <HI>what we are to understand by win∣ning Souls;</HI> about which my Text speaks, and which requires so much Wisdom to accomplish.</P>
<P>And here I would answer in one Word, <HI>That it is an effectual perswading Men to forsake their Sins, and come over to the Faith, the Love, and the Practice of Christianity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004111_0008_1003D376E5F3F910"/>Man by Sin had gone off from GOD, and gone over to the Side of the Devil and of his own Lusts, to the Love and Trust, the Worship and Service of the Creature, instead of the Creator of all Things. And by this we have lost and destroyed ourselves. So that the winning of a Soul is the perswading the Man out of this State of Sin and Misery, and per∣swading him over to GOD, and Christ, and Holi∣ness. It is a prevailing with Men to repent of all their Sins, to renounce their beloved Lusts, to turn to GOD, to believe in Christ with all their Hearts, to accept of him as their Prince and Saviour, and to live as his Grace teaches them, even up to the Prin∣ciples and the Precepts of Christianity, ordering their Conversation as becometh the Gospel of Christ.</P>
<P>Now, I say, the winning of Souls is a <HI>perswading</HI> Men to this, and not forcing them to it contrary to their Wills; it is a presenting Arguments proper to move and perswade them to it. As the Bird that is taken (to which the Word refers) is by the Skill and Cunning of the Fowler drawn and allured, and not forced to the Snare; the Bird is not hunted and driven to the Place where it is taken, but goes freely and of its own accord, the skilful Fowler having be∣forehand laid the alluring Bait, which the Bird no sooner discovers but hastens to it. Thus the winning of Souls is by presenting proper Arguments, and per∣swading them in a rational Way to come to Christ, and submit unto his Gospel, not deceiving them as the Fowler does the Bird, but rather by undeceiving them, not to destroy but to save Men.</P>
<P>And when a Soul is thus effectually perswaded, then it is won, then it is gained, then it is saved from its lost and perishing State, and brought into a State of Grace, &amp; Favour, &amp; Life; a spiritual Life here, and in the Way to eternal Life hereafter. And oh! hap∣py,
<PB N="7" REF="004111_0009_1003D37A2CFE99B8"/>
forever happy, the Soul that is thus won &amp; taken! Of such an one it may be said, <HI>he was dead but is alive, he was lost and is found,</HI> Luke 15. 32.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed now to show <HI>that Souls must be thuswon, and gained over to Chirst, and not compelled or forced against their Wills.</HI></P>
<P>We must remember they are Souls we are treati<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of, rational Souls, intellectual Beings, free moral A∣gents; and consequently their being won so as to come over to Christ, must be a rational and voluntary Act: for there is no such thing as a Soul's being won and gained over to Christ but where there is a free and full Consent of the Will, which is incompatible with Force or Compulsion.</P>
<P>The Body indeed, or the outward Man, may be forced into the visible Kingdom of Christ; <HI>that</HI> can be forced to be present in christian Assemblies, and at the publick Worship; and some, who are not for allowing to others the same Liberty they would un∣der the like Circumstances think reasonable for them∣selves; have put external Force upon Men in Mat∣ters of Religion; but it has been, and I believe it always will be found, to little Purpose to use any out∣ward Force for driving Men into the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>Indeed our Saviour bids his Servants <HI>go to the high Ways, &amp; to the Hedges, and compel them to come in that his House may he filled,</HI> Luke 14. 23. But what Com∣pulsion can we suppose Christ to mean here but a rational Compulsion, informing the Understnding, directing the Judgment, perswading the Will, and exciting the Affections of the Soul towards Christ and his Gospel? And GOD himself is represented as drawing Men, and not forcing them to Christ. <HI>No Man can come to me</HI> (says Christ) <HI>except the Fa∣ther which hath sent me draw him,</HI> John 6.44. And how does he draw us unto Christ? Why, <HI>with the Cords</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004111_0010_1003D37BF46D0540"/>
<HI>of a Man, and with the Bands of Love,</HI> Hos. 11.4. With Cords proper to draw <HI>Men,</HI> rational Beings withal. And what are they but Arguments and Mo∣tives proper to work upon our rational Nature, upon the intellectual and moral Faculties of the humane Soul? <HI>In the Day of GOD's Power they are made wil∣ling,</HI> Psal. 110.3. Although the divine Power is ex∣erted upon them, yet it is their own free Act and Deed; they act as freely in their coming over to Christ, as in any Action whatsoever.</P>
<P>The Force of humane Laws, of common Custom, of worldly Prospects or Fears, compel many Men to the external Profession of Christ and his Gospel, and so to a visible Appearance on the Side of Reli∣gion; and they who look only at the outward Ap∣pearance, may and ought charitably to judge they are won over to Christ and his Kingdom; but He whose Prerogative it is to <HI>search the Heart and try the Reins of the Children of Men,</HI> knows the contrary.</P>
<P>In short, Christ's Kingdom is a spiritual Kingdom, that is set up in the Souls of Men; and if he don't reign in Men's Hearts, he will by no Means look upon them as won over to him, nor can they be said to be gained or saved. And now Christ don't force himself upon Men whether they will or no He knocks indeed at the Doors of Men's Hearts by his Word, Ordinances, Providences, and by his Spirit; and he calls and waits for Entrance: but he will have Men to open the everlasting Doors of their Souls in order to his coming in. So that we must freely open our Souls unto him, and heartily receive him, and then and not till then, is the Soul won; for as to any external Compulsion, or Motives from any ex∣ternal Views, it signifieth nothing; the Soul may, notwithstanding all such outward Appearance, be on the Devil's side, and in a lost &amp; undone Estate.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="004111_0011_1003D37E66E3FA78"/>III. <HI>I come new to shew, That although GOD by his almighty Grace wins Souls over to Christ, yet he makes it every Man's Duty to be using Endeavours to win one another over to him; and this he com∣mits to some as their special and peculiar Business,</HI> viz. <HI>the Ministers of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Here I must briefly say these things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>1st. It is GOD by his almighty Spirit and Grace that wins Souls to Christ.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2dly. Notwithstanding this he expects that we should all be endeavouring to win one another over to Christ.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>3dly. He commits this to the Ministers of the Gospel as their special and peculiar Business.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1"><HI>1st. It is GOD, by his almighty Spirit and Grace, that wins Souls over to Christ.</HI></P>
<P>That is, Whenever any are effectually perswaded to repent of their Sins, to believe in Christ, and o∣bey his Gospel, it must be ascribed to the Agency and Influence of the divine Spirit. For although the Spirit of GOD don't work forcibly or compulsively, so as to offer any Violence to our rational Nature, or to any of our natural Powers and Faculties, yet he works powerfully and effectually upon them, in a Way that we know not how; much less can we describe it. <HI>For as the Wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but cannot tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit,</HI> John 3.8. All we can say is, That some how or other the Spirit works in and upon our Spi∣rits, and wins us over to Christ in a Way suited to our Nature, and although this Work goes on in such a natural Way that we can't discern it to be any thing but a rational Act of our own, yet when we perceive the powerful Effect we may conclude the Spirit of GOD has been at Work.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004111_0012_1003D3841C56CA90"/>The Way of the divine Spirit is to convince Men of Sin, to bring their Sins so to Remembrance, and to give them such a lively Sense hereof, as to excite unfeigned Sorrow, and at length to produce a Re∣pentance unto Salvation. He opens also Men's Eyes, to behold the wondrous Things out of GOD's Law and Gospel, to see the Glory of Christ, the a∣miableness of Religion, and the Beauty of Holiness, whereby the Soul is perswaded to believe in Christ, and come into the Love and Practice of Christianity, which is the same with the winning of the Soul.</P>
<P>And now that this Work of Conversion, or winning the Soul to GOD, is by the divine Agency and In∣fluence, is abundantly evident from the Oracles of GOD, there we find GOD assuming it as his Prero∣gative <HI>to give a new Heart, and to put within us a right Spirit,</HI> Ezek. 36. 26. And the being Born a∣gain, which, is the same thing, is expresly said to be <HI>not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh, nor of the Will of Men, but of GOD,</HI> John 1.13. And our coming to Christ is expresly declared to be by the divine Influence, and that it can't be without it; <HI>No Man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him,</HI> John 6.44. In a Word, although we are <HI>to work out our Salvation with Fear &amp; Trembling, yet it is GOD that works in us both to Will and to Do of his good Pleasure,</HI> Phil. 2.12, 13. And <HI>such as are saved, it is by Grace, thro' Faith, and that not of ourselves, but it is the Gift of GOD,</HI> Eph. 2.8.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly. Notwithstanding</HI> this, <HI>we should all be endea∣vouring to win one anther over to Christ.</HI></P>
<P>For although it be GOD that converts, and wins the Soul; yet he does it in and by the Use of Means. And he makes great use of those who are converted, to gain others also over to Christ: And he makes it the Duty of all, to be doing what they can in this
<PB N="11" REF="004111_0013_1003D388146004C8"/>
Matter, nay the very Principle wrought in the Soul that is <HI>won,</HI> will prompt him unto it. He that is converted must endeavour to convert and strengthen his Brethren.</P>
<P>All those Commandments in the Word of GOD, of instructing and counselling, of exhorting and ad∣monishing one another, are so many Injunctions upon us to be doing what we can to perswade others o∣ver to Christ, for they all have a direct Tendency that Way. In a Word, these two great Command∣ments of <HI>loving the Lord our GOD with all our Heart,</HI> &amp;c. and of <HI>loving our Neighbour as ourselves,</HI> plainly oblige this. For how can we express our Concern for the Honour of GOD and Christ, so much as by endeavouring to gain others over to Christ's Kingdom, whereby they may with us glorify our Father which is in Heaven? And how can we so fully shew our Love to our Neighbour, as by en∣deavouring all we can to <HI>convert him from the Error of his Ways,</HI> and thereby <HI>to save his Soul from Death?</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly. GOD commits this Work of winning Souls to the Ministers of the Gospel, as their special and peculiar Business.</HI></P>
<P>Although it be the Duty of every Man, according to his Opportunities and Abilities, to endeavour the Conversion and Salvation of others; yet as it is a Bu∣siness so difficult, and of such vast Importance to Men and so apt to be neglected, when it is left indif∣ferently to all, that GOD in great Wisdom and Kindness to Men, has provided an Order of Men, that should devote themselves to this Service; that should study to acomplish themselves for it, and then give themselves wholly to it. I mean the Ministers of the Gospel, for this is the grand Design of their Office, to win and gain Souls over to Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004111_0014_1003B5B12B8F65D0"/>To them is <HI>committed the Ministry of Reconciliation, that they</HI> might in <HI>Christ's Name and Stead, intreat and beseech Men to be reconciled unto GOD,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.18, 20. Their Business is <HI>to shew Men the Way to Salvation,</HI> and perswade Men to come into it. They are sent <HI>to open Men's Eyes, to turn them from Dark∣ness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD, that they may receive Forgiveness of Sins, and Inheri∣tance among them that are sanctified,</HI> Acts 26. 18. They are the Souls of Men that are committed to the Care and Charge of Ministers, and their Business is, <HI>to watch for Souls as those that must give an Ac∣count,</HI> to watch all Opportunities to win and gain them, <HI>that so they may do it with Joy and not with Grief,</HI> Heb. 13. 17. And we find that their Care must be, not only <HI>to save their own Souls,</HI> but the <HI>Souls of them that hear them,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.16.</P>
<P>Moreover that <HI>this</HI> is the grand Business of Minis∣ters, may be argued from every Branch in the mi∣nisterial Office, for it has a plain direct Tendency to this. Thus the preaching of the Gospel, which is a principal Part of the Minister's Work, What is this for, but to beget Men, through the Gospel, unto Christ? To open and confirm the great Doctrines of the Gospel, to explain the great Duties of Christi∣anity, and urge a Compliance with them, from the Arguments and Motives which the Gospel affords; that so they might get into Christ, and be saved from all Condemnation, and might obtain the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal Life.</P>
<P>Again, what is the Design of their baptising ac∣cording to the Institution of Christ, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, but to set Christ's Mark upon them, to seal them with his Seal, to initiate them into his Church and Covenant, to put them in the Way of his Grace, and
<PB N="13" REF="004111_0015_1003D38A7A9D2468"/>
so in the way of Salvation? For altho' Baptism of it self don't save, as an outward Ceremony or <HI>putting away of the filth of the Flesh;</HI> yet it will <HI>where there is the Answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.21.</P>
<P>Again, What is the Design of their administring the holy Sacrament of the Supper, but that by such a lively Remembrance of Christ &amp; of his dying Love, our Souls may be filled with love and thankfulness unto him; may be led to Repentance by such an Instance of amazing Love and Goodness, and may be encouraged to believe in him and obey his Gospel, that so we may partake of the saving Benefits of his Death? What is it for, but to encourage &amp; strengthen those holy Souls that have gone over to Christ, to nourish and refresh them in Grace, Holiness and Com∣fort, unto eternal Life?</P>
<P>Finally, What is the design of all the faithful Reproofs, the publick and solemn Censures of the Church dispensed by the Ministers of Christ, but to reduce and recover Backsliders &amp; Revolters, to bring back straying and perishing Souls to Christ? For when such Admonitions take place, and answer the End, <HI>a Brother is gained,</HI> as our Saviour says, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. 15.</P>
<P>And now from these Hints, and many more that might be given, it is abundantly evident, that the winning or gaining Souls is committed to Ministers, as their special and peculiar business.</P>
<P>I proceed to the last Thing proposed, which I had chiefly in view, and shall in large most upon, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>That in winning Souls there requires a great deal of Skill and Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And he that winneth Souls is wise:</HI> It shews him to be a wise Man that winneth Souls, for it is a Bu∣siness
<PB N="14" REF="004111_0016_1003B5B34C5AF2D8"/>
that requires a great deal of Skill and Wisdom in the Management of it to any Purpose.</P>
<P>What I propose here is,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st.<HI>To prove the Point, and make it evident that there is a great deal of Skill and Wisdom requisite in winning Souls.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 dly. <HI>To describe that Wisdom, which will accomplish for, and that must be exercised in this important Business.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> I am <HI>to prove the Point, and shew that there is a great deal of Skill and Wisdom requisite in win∣ning Souls.</HI></P>
<P>And the Truth of <HI>this</HI> will plainly appear only by considering, 1st. <HI>What it is that the soul is to be won from.</HI> 2 dly. <HI>What it is to be won or gained over to.</HI> And, 3 dly. <HI>What subtle and powerful Opposers we have to deal with in this Matter.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1st.</HI> Let us consider, <HI>What it is that the Soul is to be won from;</HI> and this will give us some View of the Difficulties of it, and so of the Wisdom needful to accomplish it.</P>
<P>And now, in general, it is a winning Men over from their corrupt Nature, from their beloved Lusts and from those evil Practices that they have been long accustomed unto; it is a perswading Men to change the very Temper of their Minds, and to alter the whole Course of Life. The winning a Soul is the perswading a Man from those Apprehensions and Inclinations that are natural to him since the Fall; it is a perswading him to renounce and abandon all his spiritual, and fleshly, and worldly Lusts, such as Pride, Malice, Envy, Discontent, Unbelief, Cove∣teousness, Sensuality, and the like, which are natural to the unregenerate Soul, and so dear to him, that it seems as easy to prevail with him to cut off a right Hand, or to pluck out a right Eye, as to part with them. Moreover, he is perswaded to change his

Course of Life, to forsake the Pleasures of Sin, and the evil Ways that he has been long accustomed un∣to; which seems as difficult for him to do as for the <HI>Ethiopean to change his Skin, and the Leopard his Spot.</HI> He is perswaded to break off from the Love and al∣lowed Practice of any known Sin, to <HI>hate every evil and false Way,</HI> and not suffer any one <HI>Sin to have the Dominion over him:</HI> He is perswaded to <HI>depart from his own Iniquity, and to lay aside every Weight, and the Sin that most easily besets him,</HI> And now, let any Man judge, Whether it won't require very high Degrees of Wisdom and Skill, to perswade and win Men over to all this.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> Let us consider, <HI>What the Soul is won over to;</HI> which will be a further Proof of the Point.</P>
<P>And, in general, It is to those Things, that are quite contrary to the carnal and corrupt Apprehen∣sions and Inclinations of Nature. He that wins a Soul, perswades the Man that was wont to say unto GOD, <HI>Depart from me, for I desire not the Knowledge of thy Ways</HI> Job 21.14. now to say, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on Earth that I desire besides thee,</HI> Psa. 73. 25. And from answering like proud <HI>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his Voice?</HI> Exod. 5.2. He is perswaded to that gracious Language of Soul, <HI>Whatsoever the Lord my GOD shall say unto me, that will I do,</HI> Deut 5.27. And from saying with respect to Religion &amp; religious Duties, <HI>Behold, What a Weariness is it? And When will the Sabbath be over? To love GOD's Law, and to rejoice in the Way of his Testimonies, as much as in all Riches; to delight in drawing near to GOD, and esteeming a Day in his Courts better than a Thousand.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, The winning of a Soul, is a per∣swading the Man to a Life of Faith in a crucified Saviour, <HI>Which to the Jews was a stumbling Block, and to the Greeks Foolishness.</HI> And to venture his
<PB N="16" REF="004111_0018_1003D391894FFCC8"/>
Soul, and the eternal Concerns thereof, with Him, as one able to save to the uttermost. It is a perswading the Soul to live no more by Sight and Sense, but by Faith; to be looking, not to Things seen, which are temporal, but to Things unseen, and eternal; all which meets with great Opposition from our Pride, Carrnality, and an evil Heart of Unbelief.</P>
<P>Again, The Soul that is won, is perswaded <HI>to deny himself, to take up his Cross, and follow the Lamb whi∣thersoever he goes,</HI> Matth. 16.24. and patiently en∣dure the utmost Hardships and Difficulties, that he may be called unto for the sake of Christ, which carnal self Love, Ease, and Sloth, will very much oppose.</P>
<P>Finally, He is perswaded to those Things, which corrupt Nature does directly rise up against; such as forgiving Injuries, loving Enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And now, What short of the utmost Wisdom and Skill must it be, to perswade Men to this?</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> But then, let us consider, <HI>What subtle and powerful Opposers we have to deal with in this Matter.</HI></P>
<P>And here we don't <HI>wrestle</HI> against corrupt Nature, against <HI>Flesh and Blood only, but against Principalities, a∣gainst Powers, against the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, against spiritual Wickednesses in high Places,</HI> Eph. 6.12. The Devil, that old Serpent, with his Subtilty and Malice, stole Man away from GOD at first, and he, with all his cursed Legions, is using all their Skill and Policy, to prevent our returning to GOD again. And, Oh! the innumerable Wiles, and subtle Devices of those ghostly Adversaries, to keep their hold of us, and hinder us from returning to GOD, and to our Happiness; which Ministers must be aware of, to obviate and answer, if they would win and recover Souls out of their Hands. And what a Multitude of Ways, must the natural Subtil∣ty
<PB N="17" REF="004111_0019_1003B5B6E0846AC8"/>
and long Experience of those malicious Spirits have found out, to keep Men under strong Delusions, and prevent their harkening to the Voice of the Charmer, altho' he charms never so wisely?</P>
<P>But then, Besides the subtle Insinuations of Satan, there are the continual Inticements, and earnest So∣licitations of Sinners, the bewitching Examples of the Wicked, the aluring Baits of the World, such as the Riches, the Honours, &amp; the Pleasures of it: The Sophistry and Cunning of Infidels, the peculiar Difficulties of some Men's Tempers, their Circum∣stances, their Employments, their Education, and their Customs; which all conspire to oppose and hin∣der Men from returning to GOD, and to their Happiness.</P>
<P>And now, When we lay all these Things together, and at the same Time consider, how corrupt Nature is on the same Side, and prejudiced in favour of e∣very Argument or Pretence that Way, that has the least Degree of Plausibleness in it, and we shall see that it needs even the Skill of Angels, to know how to manage with Men, so as to win them over to Christ; and consequently, that the wisest of Men must needs be sometimes posed and nonplus'd, so as not to know what to do with Sinners, or what Methods to take to gain them, and if it was not for the Supply of Wisdom and Grace, from the Fountain hereof, they would easily be outwitted, and over∣matched by those spiritual Wickednesses in high Places.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>I proceed now to give some Account of that Wis∣dom and skill, that is necessary for the winning souls.</HI></P>
<P>As for Wisdom in general, it consists in proposing some good End, and in projecting; and pursuing the most proper Methods for accomplishing the same
<PB N="18" REF="004111_0020_1003D393E846F960"/>
And the higher the End proposed, and the more difficult to accomplish it, the more Conspicuous is the Wisdom in attaining the End.</P>
<P>And now, As to the winning Souls, What nobler End can we propose? What can we aim at better, than to gain Souls over to Christ, to rescue them out of the Hands of Satan, and deliver them out of the dreadful Bondage they are in to Sin and Death, and bring them into the glorious Liberties of the Sons of GOD? This is the way to bring Glory to GOD and Christ, to save Souls, precious and immortal Souls, from future everlasting Wrath &amp; Misery, &amp; bring them into a State of eternal Life and Happiness. So that the Skill and Wisdom here to be described, is <HI>that</HI> which consists in taking the best, and the most likely Methods to win Souls.</P>
<P>And, Here I shall hint at several Points of Wis∣dom, which seems highly convenient, if not absolute∣ly necessary, for those whose Business it is to win Souls, if they would carry it on to any good Purpose.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>It is highly requisite that such be well acquainted with the Religion they are to win Souls over to; and well skilled in the Arguments, proper to be made use of to perswade them to it.</HI></P>
<P>This seems to be the Foundation of all the after Acts of Wisdom that Men are to exercise in this Matter, and without this it is impossible to manage the Affair with any Wisdom. It is highly requisite in order to our managing any Affair after a proper Manner, that we undersand the Business we are going about, or, ten to one, we shall commit some fatal Mistake.</P>
<P>So he that undertakes to win Souls, if he be wise, and would not miscarry in his Designs, will take Care before hand to understand his Business, that is the Nature and the Importance of it, and what is the
<PB N="19" REF="004111_0021_1003D3535760CD60"/>
most likely Way to manage it to good Effect. He must understand the present wretched and miserable State of Souls by reason of Sin, must be acquainted with the glorious Remedy that is provided for poor perishing Souls, and what they must be brought over to, in order to their being saved; and he must be furnished with those Arguments that are most proper to work upon such sinful stupid Souls, most likely to awaken them, and to perswade them out of their wretched State.</P>
<P>And as those Things are most surely and clearly revealed in the holy Scriptures, so it must needs be a point of Wisdom for every one that is designing this Business, to get well acquainted with them. <HI>They are given by Inspiration of GOD, and are profitable, for Doc∣trine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness; that the Man of GOD may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good Works,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16. And no Work do they so particularly furnish Men for, as this of winning Souls. They give us an Ac∣count of the primitive Apostacy of Man, and of the deplorable State that we are brought into by re∣ason thereof: They reveal Jesus Christ, the glorious Re∣medy provided for a perishing World; which Things the World would have remained ignorant of to this very Day, if it had not been for those sacred Wri∣tings: They shew us the Path of Life: They lead us to Christ: They tell us what we must believe, and what we must do to be saved. And they present the most moving Arguments to win our Souls; Ar∣guments to work upon our Judgments, our Wills, our Affections, our Hopes, our Fears, and upon e∣very Power of the Soul. And so in short, <HI>they are able to make us wise unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Jesus Christ,</HI> 2 Tim 3.15. So that it is abso∣lutely necessary to a Man's being qualified to win
<PB N="20" REF="004111_0022_1003D39DEFF728D8"/>
Souls, That he be well acquainted with the holy Scrip∣tures, &amp; that not barely with the Words of Scripture, &amp; to have the Bible so in our Memories as to be able to say a great Part of it by Rote, &amp; quote Chapter &amp; Verse: But such as undertake the Business of winning Souls, should understand the true Sense &amp; Meaning of the Scrip∣tures in general; I say in general, because it is not to be supposed, That Ministers should be able to understand every Part of Scripture; for if one of the Apostles could say, with respect to the Epistles of another, that there were in them <HI>some Things hard to be understood,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.16. it will be no Wonder if there should be many Things in their Writings beyond us to understand: and it shews a Want of Modesty, as well as Judgment, for any to pretend to a full Understanding of every Part of Scripture, or to think it necessary that every Part be understood by us; it is sufficient for us, that the necessary Points are so clearly revealed, as that with diligent Study, comparing one Part of Scripture with another, we may come to the Knowledge of them: And this every Minister should labour after.</P>
<P>And, In order to this, some Acquaintance with the Languages that the Scriptures were originally written in, and with the expository Notes of learned Men upon the Scriptures, with ecclesiastical History, and many other Parts of Learning, is very convenient, and needful to a Man's being <HI>an able Minister of the new Testament, and a workman that need not to be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, Such as would be well accomplished to win Souls, should be able to distinguish between Truth and Error; between necessary and unnecessary Points; between the weightier and the less weighty Matters of the Law and Gospel; between Fundamentals and Circumstantials; between the Form and the Power of Godliness.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004111_0023_1003D3A136222B58"/>It is necessary that such be able to open and con∣firm the great Doctrines of the Gospel against Infi∣dels, and for the Conviction of Gain-sayers; to ex∣plain the Duties of Christianity; and furnished with proper Arguments to press them upon the Consci∣ences of Men, silencing their Cavils, answering their Objections and Excuses, removing Stones of stum∣bling, or Rocks of Offence, out of the Way.</P>
<P>Thus a Man that devotes himself to the Service of Christ and of Souls, must be a <HI>ready Scribe, well in∣structed to the Kingdom of GOD,</HI> Matth. 13.32. He must be furnished with all the Weapons that the Gos∣pel affords, which are not <HI>carnal, but mighty through GOD, for the pulling down of strong Holds, casting down Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth it∣self against the Knowledge of GOD, and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 10.4, 5.</P>
<P N="2">2 dly. <HI>It is highly proper that such be won over to Christ themselves, who are employed in winning o∣thers over to him.</HI></P>
<P>If this be not absolutely necessary, and if we should grant it possible for a Man to be the Means of con∣verting others by his Ministry, and yet he <HI>himself be a Castaway;</HI> yet as to humane Appearance, and the natural Tendency of Things, there is but little Probability that such an one would do much towards the winning others over to Christ, that has never been won over to him himself.</P>
<P>How can that Man urge the great Arguments of the Gospel with Fervency and Force, that has never been moved by them himself? Nay, with what Force can a Man urge and perswade others to forsake their Sins, and believe in Christ, and obey his Gos∣pel, when he don't feel the Arguments to have any Effect upon his own Soul?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004111_0024_1003B5B872CA8C58"/>But now, on the other Hand, How will such a Man urge this and the other Duty, when he him∣self has felt the Force of those very Arguments that he uses with others? Who can set forth the Excellency and Amiableness of Religion, like those who have tasted the Pleasures of it, and that can testify from their own Experience, that <HI>the Ways of Religion are ways of Pleasantness &amp; the Paths thereof Peace?</HI> Who so likely to pitch upon the best Arguments to per∣swade Men to be religious, as they, who have found by Experience, what have been the most forcible upon themselves?</P>
<P>And then again, Who so likely to be diligent and faithful in pursuing this grand Design of the Mi∣nistry, even that of winning Souls, like those who are won over to the Love and Service of Christ, and are filled accordingly with a Zeal for his Honour, and with a compassionate Concern for the Souls of Men? And, Oh! With how much greater Pleasure will such pursue the Business that will be so much to the Glory of Christ and the Good of Souls, than one who <HI>careth for none of these Things?</HI> In a Word, Who so likely to lay themselves out in this Service, as they who have their very Hearts and Souls enga∣ged in this Matter? Which is the Case of every Mi∣nister that is himself thoroughly and effectually won over to Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3 dly. <HI>There is a great deal of Wisdom and Skill to be used in the direct Application to the Souls of Men, in order to win and gain them over to Christ.</HI></P>
<P>As these previous Accomplishments are very use∣ful and necessary, so, if we would win Souls, we must, in our Ministrations and Applications to them, ma∣nage with particular Skill and Wisdom. And as there are publick and general, and, upon Occasion, private and personal Applications to be made to the
<PB N="23" REF="004111_0025_1003D3A48B2D4078"/>
Souls of Men; so in both these, Ministers must ma∣nage with great Prudence, if they would answer the End proposed. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>In their publick Ministrations, they must manage with great Wisdom, if they would win Souls.</HI></P>
<P>Ministers must know how to behave themselves in the House of GOD, which is the Church of the li∣ving GOD. All the Ministrations of GOD's House must be managed so as to have a direct Tendency to this grand End of their Ministry.</P>
<P>Thus, As Ministers are employed to be the Mouth of the People to GOD in the publick Prayers; so these must be carried on in such a Manner as will best Answer the End of that great Duty of Prayer. They must so order their Speech and their Beha∣viour in Prayer, as will be most likely to command the Attention, excite the Reverence, and raise the Devotion of the People. They must wisely accom∣modate their Confessions to the Sins, their Petitions and Intercessions to the Wants, their Thanksgivings to the Mercies of the People; and should mention nothing in Prayer but what the Assembly that hear may and ought to join with them in.</P>
<P>And then, as to Preaching, which is a principal Part of the publick Service, there is great Wisdom requisite in the managing of it, so as that the Word might prove a Savour of Life unto Life unto them that hear it. And now, as in <HI>preaching,</HI> Ministers are to <HI>Teach, Exhort,</HI> and <HI>Rebuke;</HI> so in all these the Preacher must manage with great Discretion.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>Ministers must</HI> TEACH <HI>the People with Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, In teaching the Doctrines and Duties of the Gospel, Ministers must take care that they don't mistake the Doctrines and Commandments of Men, for the Doctrines and Commandments of Men, for the Doctrines and Commandments of GOD our Saviour. And here, although Ministers may not
<PB N="24" REF="004111_0026_1003D3A6FA73A750"/>
shun to declare the whole Counsel of GOD, so far as it is made known unto them; yet they must distinguish and insist chiefly upon the most necessary and im∣portant Points of Christianity.</P>
<P>And, Here I would take the Opportunity to say, That as for the <HI>sublime mysterious Doctrines of the Gospel,</HI> they should always be treated with great Re∣verence and Caution; and in those Articles, if Mi∣nisters would be wise, they wont pretend <HI>to be wise above what is written.</HI> But the deeper and darker the Point is, the more closely must they adhere to the written Oracles of GOD; to which <HI>they will do well</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>to take heed, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark Place,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.19. And, I cannot but think this has been the Fault on all Sides, that they have departed, some more and some less, from the written Word, in their discoursing upon, and undertaking to explain the Mysteries of the Gos∣pel; and each Party has been more fond of suppor∣ting his own particular Terms, and Manner of Ex∣pression, than to sit down contented with the Doc∣trines, as the Holy Ghost has delivered them unto us; by which Means, instead of winning Souls over to Christ, they only win them over to a particular Par∣ty; which very Thing has divided the christian World into innumerable Sects. Whereas, if Mi∣nisters, and other Christians, had, in all their Discour∣ses upon mysterious Points, laid aside humane Expli∣cations and adhered to the Word, as a <HI>Lamp unto their Feet, and a Light their Paths,</HI> Psal. 119.105. those unhappy Divisions might have been in a great Measure prevented.</P>
<P>The <HI>Essence</HI> of GOD, <HI>the Manner of the divine sub∣sistence,</HI> the <HI>Decrees</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Manner of his Operation upon his Creatures,</HI> especially upon <HI>moral
<PB N="25" REF="004111_0027_1003B5BA63C00DC8"/>
Agents,</HI> are some of the <HI>deep Things of GOD, which the Spirit of GOD alone can search out,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.10.</P>
<P>And therefore, The Minister that is so wise as to know himself, will have such a modest humble Sense of his own Weakness and Ignorance about these Things, as to take up contented with the Words of the Holy Ghost, believing that they set these Things in the truest and best Light, and go so far as we are capable of understanding, or, as is necessary for us to understand; and that most, if not all, humane At∣tempts to explain those Points, have rather darkned than enlightned them; being Words <HI>without Know∣ledge, which darken Counsel,</HI> Job. 38.2.</P>
<P>So, that if the Preacher be wise, when he speaks of those Things, he will chuse rather to speak of them <HI>in the Words which the Holy Ghost teacheth, com∣paring spiritual Things with spiritual;</HI> than in the <HI>Words which Man's Wisdom teacheth,</HI> agreable to the Apostles own Practice, as he tells us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.13.</P>
<P>But, to proceed, We are told, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.9. that <HI>because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the Peo∣ple Knowledge:</HI> Or, as it is in the Margin of some Bi∣bles, <HI>the more wise the Preacher was, he still taught the Peo∣ple Knowledge.</HI> So that he is the wise Preacher that endeavours to be Instructive in his preaching. He is the <HI>Pastor after GOD's own Heart, that feeds the People with Knowledge and Understanding,</HI> Jer. 3.15. that don't turn the People off with unintelligible Terms, dark Phrases, and obscure Reasonings; but will, as the Apostles says they did, <HI>use great Plainnss of Speech,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.12. I don't mean by this, that Men should use bald Expressions, and homely Simi∣litudes; but such Expressions as will best serve to con∣vey the clearest Ideas of the Point they are discour∣sing, in the most agreeable Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004111_0028_1003D3AF1F1FB278"/><HI>Lastly</HI> under this Head, The Preacher that is wise will endeavour <HI>to make full Proof of h
is Ministry.</HI> 2 Tim 4.5. For, as it is when the Word is <HI>mixed with Faith,</HI> that it becomes profitable to the Souls of Men; so it is highly proper that the Preacher should present them with proper Arguments, as a Foundation for their Faith, even such Proofs as the Nature of the Subject will afford, and such as the People may per∣cieve the Force of.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> But then, As Ministers <HI>are to give Attendance to</HI> EXHORTATION, as well as Doctrine, so there is a particular Skill and Wisdom requisite in managing <HI>this,</HI> so as to win Souls.</P>
<P>This is that Part of preaching which is directed immediately to the Consciences of Men, perswading and urging them to that Faith, and Love, and Ho∣liness, which will be Salvation unto them. And now here it is requisite that Ministers should be skil∣led in all the Arts of Perswasion; and that they be Master of all those Arguments that are apt to strike the Minds and Consciences of Men; and of that Rhetorick too, which will strike the Passions; for as the whole Soul is to be won, so there ought to be a moving Address to all the Powers and Faculties, to every Passion and Affection the Soul.</P>
<P>The Preacher that was wise sought to find out <HI>acceptable Words,</HI> Eccl. 12.10 <HI>Words of Delight,</HI> as in the Margin: Words that delight and please the Soul, which wou'd wonderfully allure and attract it. And we all find by Experience, that the Soul is charmed and captivated by the pungent and pathetick Strains of the Preacher, that has wisely ordered his Speech for that Purpose.</P>
<P>He therefore, that is wise, will seek out such ac∣ceptable Words; which, by the Way, teaches how far they are from managing this Matter with Wis∣dom,
<PB N="27" REF="004111_0029_1003D3B913CF6170"/>
who, instead of seeking out acceptable Words, seek out no Words at all before-hand, but turn the People off with extemporaneous Discourses, and con∣sequently with those Words that come uppermost, and those delivered in a confused, hesitating, and hobling Manner, which creates an Uneasiness rather than Pleasure in the Hearers, and so will be very unlikely to win upon them.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> As Ministers are to REBUKE, as well as Exhort, in their preaching; so it requires as much Wisdom to manage it properly, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to answer the End of winning Souls, as any Part of the Sermon.</P>
<P>Ministers are <HI>to cry aloud, &amp; not to spare; to shew to the House of</HI> Jacob <HI>their Transgressions; and to</HI> Israel <HI>their Sins.</HI> But to do this in a Manner that will an∣swer the Design, requires peculiar Skill. The Mi∣nister must be faithful, but not too severe, in publick Reproofs. So plain, as that every one that is guilty may easily apply it to himself; and yet not so particu∣lar as publickly to expose Men's Characters, where the Crimes are private. He must duly expose the Sirs and Vices of the People, setting them forth in the clearest Colours, representing their evil Nature, and warning them of the fatal Consequences of Sin: But yet, this must be done in a Way that will convince and soften, and melt Men down into Repentance, rather than irritate, and so harden them in their Sins. It must be managed so as will best serve to excite within Men a just Sense and Hatred of their Sins; and at the same time, an higher Esteem and Love for the wise Reprover. And, <HI>as an Ear Ring of Gold, and an Ornament of fine Gold; so is a wise Re∣pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver, upon an obedient Ear,</HI> Prov. 25.12. And thus much for the Wisdom of the Preacher.</P>
<P>And as for the other Ministrations of GOD's House: I must but just hint at the Wisdom that is
<PB N="28" REF="004111_0030_1003D3C0964E48F0"/>
requisite to the Management of <HI>these</HI> so as will best answer the gracious Institutions of them.</P>
<P>Thus, as to the administring BAPTISM and the LORD'S SUPPER, Ministers must instruct in the Nature and Design of these holy Ordinances; must give due Invitation and Encouragement to Persons to at∣tend upon them, and at the same Time, warning them of the Danger of coming in a prophane, care∣less, and unworthy Manner; and they must wisely distinguish between the clean and the unclean, the fit and the unfit Subjects of these Ordinances.</P>
<P>And then, In the Administration of these Ordinances, Ministers must behave with that Gravity, with that Seriousness, and with that Devotion, as may serve to excite and influence the Devotion of others, where∣by the Design of these sacred Institutions will best be answered. And here, in particular, as the Design of the <HI>holy Supper</HI> is to give Men a lively Remembrance of the dying Love of our dear Redeemer, so this sacred Festival should be so celebrated, and all the Parts of the Institution so managed, as may serve to excite the most lively and affecting Remembrance of Him.</P>
<P>And then, As to the CENSURES of the Church, dis∣penced by the Ministers of Christ, (such as publick Admonitions, Suspensions, and Excommunications) I would say, that as this Authority was not given <HI>for Destruction,</HI> but for <HI>Edification;</HI> so Ministers must endeavour to manage it in such a Manner as will be most likely to answer this End, <HI>viz.</HI> That in such <HI>a Destruction of the Flesh, the Spirit might be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus,</HI> 1 Cor 5.5. Furthermore, Al∣tho' we must be faithful to our straying Brethren, yet we must deal and let them see that we deal tenderly with them: Altho' we may nor neglect them, yet we may not be too hasty or severe in our publick
<PB N="29" REF="004111_0031_1003D3C81BAAB3E0"/>
Censures of them. But we must <HI>exhort and rebuke with all long suffering.</HI> And there we must take Care that nothing of this Nature be done <HI>by Partiality;</HI> and yet a <HI>Difference</HI> is to be made, according to the Na∣ture and Aggravations of the Offence. Let there be no ecclesiastical Prosecutions <HI>thro' Strife, vain Glory,</HI> or any private Pique or Revenge, <HI>but in lowliness of Mind,</HI> Phil. 2.3. In a Word, Every Admonition and Censure of the Church, must be managed with such a Spirit of Meekness, Love, and Tenderness, as may soften and melt the Offender into Repentance. And thus much for the Wisdom requisite in the pub∣lick Ministrations of GOD's House.</P>
<P>I shall briefly Consider,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> The Wisdom needful for Ministers <HI>in their private Application to Souls.</HI></P>
<P>There is often times Occasion for Ministers to apply themselves privately and personally to Men. Such as are under Convictions and Concern about their spiritual State, will repair to their spiritual Guides for Counsel and Comfort: And others that are stupid and careless about their Souls, it is no Ways improper for Ministers to go to them; and doubtless pastoral Visits, if they be managed wisely, may be of great Advantage. And since it is the Minister's Business and Calling to <HI>win Souls,</HI> it seems very proper that what Time they can spare from their Studies and pub∣lick Labours, and other necessary Avocations, they should devote to the Service of particular Souls.</P>
<P>But now here is a great deal of Wisdom necessary to manage such private Conferences &amp; Conversation to good Advantage. Here Ministers must consider the particular Tempers, Circumstances, and Cond∣itions of Men that they converse with, applying Counsels, Comforts, Cautions, Warnings, and Re∣proofs, as they see the Persons need, and that will
<PB N="30" REF="004111_0032_1003D3CEB66BAO18"/>
be likely to do them good. We must consider whe∣ther Men's Tempers be quick and hasty, proud and haughty; whether they be humble and meek; whe∣ther they be self-conceited and spiritually proud; whether they be dejected or discouraged; and must address ourselves to them accordingly. Moreover we must consider what particular Sins they are addicted to; and must faithfully, but in the most friendly Manner, warn and admonish them thereof. We must find out the particular Difficulties and Objections in their Way of coming to Christ, wisely adjusting our Counsels and Arguments to the Circumstances and Capacities of Persons.</P>
<P>Moreover Ministers, if they would be wise, must watch for favourable Opportunities to perswade Men over to Christ; such as times of Sickness and Dan∣ger, times of Sorrow and Mourning; so also, when they have experienced remarkable Preservations and Deliverances. In a Word, as there are <HI>favourable Opportunities, happy Junctures,</HI> for speaking to Per∣sons of their spiritual Concerns, so Ministers should watch for them, and by no Means let them slip. But I must hasten to another general Instance of Wis∣dom necessary in Ministers, in order to their winning Souls, and that is,</P>
<P N="3">3 dly. <HI>Their being very</HI> EXEMPLARY <HI>in their Lives and Conversations.</HI></P>
<P>This is a main Point, without which, all the rest will signify little: For if a Man prays and preaches, and discourses at all times, as it were, with the Tongue of Angels, yet, to what Purpose will it all be, if he contradicts it by his own Practice? And I know nothing that brings a greater Reproach upon Reli∣gion, and that so effectually frustrates the grand De∣sign of the Ministry, as the corrupt Practices and un∣exemplary Behaviour of those who have worn that
<PB N="31" REF="004111_0033_1003D3D89601BA60"/>
sacred Character. For how is it possible that a People should be perswaded and wrought upon by the pre∣aching of those whom they see are not at all wrought upon by their own Arguments, and openly reject their own Counsels and Warnings? And truly, what can look so absurd as to hear Ministers crying down this and the other Sin on the Sabbath, and yet live in the allowed Practice of them, all the Week af∣ter? How reproachful must it needs be to Ministers, and what a Discredit to Religion, for them to teach one thing and practice the quite contrary? <HI>Thou that Preachest a Man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayest a Man should not commit Adultery, dost thou commit Adultery? Thou that abborrest Idols, dost thou commit Sacrilege?</HI> Rom. 2 21 22.</P>
<P>Our blessed Lord wisely considered the great Ad∣vantage of a good Example; and so exhibited a most perfect Pattern to the World in his own Life, and gives it in express Charge to his Disciples, <HI>to let their Lights so shine before Men, that others might see their good Works, and glorify their Father which is in Heaven,</HI> Mat. 5.16. And agreable to this the A∣postle Charges his Son <HI>Timothy,</HI> saying, <HI>Let no Man despite thy Youth, but be thou an Example to the Belie∣vers, in word, in Conversation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.12. Observe here the Way that the Apostle advises young <HI>Tim thy</HI> to take that he might not be despised, was to be Exemplary in the Spirit and Temper of his Mind, and in the whole Conduct and Behaviour of himself; and there is no other Way that will save Ministers from Con∣tempt; nor any Way so likely for them to win upon the Souls of others. What is there that will give such Force to their exhortations, and that will re∣commend Religion to the Esteem the Love and Practice of others, as to see all the Vertues and
<PB N="32" REF="004111_0034_1003D3DE50AA6F08"/>
Graces of it exemplisied in the Minister's own Life? When does Religion appear so amiable, as when we see it drawn to the Life in a Man's Temper and Be∣haviour?</P>
<P><HI>Wisdom,</HI> that is Religion, <HI>makes a Man's Face to shine.</HI> And how glorious does a Minister shine a∣mong a People, when his Life and Conversation is but a Transcript of his Preaching? Verily it is not easy to conceive how such a Man would win upon a People. Therefore this is a grand Point for Mi∣nisters to take Care of in their first setting out, as the Way to save them from Contempt, to honour their Character, and to <HI>adorn the Doctrine of GOD their Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>But here, with respect to a Minister's <HI>Conversation,</HI> there is Wisdom and Prudence to be exercised: For as Ministers may not be <HI>light and vain</HI> in their Con∣versation, so they must avoid the other Extreme of <HI>a m rose affected Gravity;</HI> for this disassects People to Religion, as much as too great Levity. Nor are Ministers to be superciliously brow-beating every thing in Company that promotes an innocent and civil Mirth. On the other Hand, They must take heed that they don't countenance, much less promote <HI>that</HI> which is <HI>filthy</HI> or <HI>prophane.</HI></P>
<P>Ministers may be pleasant in Company, as well as other Men, so long as they observe proper Seasons, and keep within the Bounds of Civility and Christi∣anity. There is a Time to <HI>Laugh,</HI> as well as a Time to <HI>Mourn;</HI> and Religion is not to be represented in such gloomy Colours, as to forbid every Thing that excites a civil Mirth; for this would discourage, ra∣ther than allure Men to Religion.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Ministers would do well to consider their Age and standing in the World: And, as el∣der Ministers, according to the natural Tendency
<PB N="33" REF="004111_0035_1003D3E9300DD1A0"/>
of Age, should lay aside the Gaiety and Mirth that is natural to Youth; so young Ministers, although they should be of a grave Behaviour, yet should not pretend to assume, in all Respects, the Gravity of old Age, least it should be suspected to be mere Affecta∣tion, which would prevent its answering any good End.</P>
<P N="4">4 thly. <HI>Another Point of Wisdom necessary to the win∣ning Souls, is DILIGENCE.</HI></P>
<P>The Business of winning Souls requires a close and constant Application: And he that deals with a slack Hand in this Matter, will do but little to the Purpose. Ministers, whose Business it is to win Souls, should endeavour that no one Soul committed to their Charge should perish thro' their Neglect. And con∣sidering the great Number of Souls, the various Circumstances and Conditions of them, and the vast variety of Means that must be used with them, the Minister will find that he must be very industri∣ous, or some of them will suffer.</P>
<P>It becomes Ministers, as much as any Men in the World, to be so wise as to <HI>redeem the Time;</HI> to watch and improve all Opportunities for doing Good to the Souls of Men. If we consider the whole Circle of a Minister's Work, both in his private Studies, his private Conferences, &amp; in his publick Administrations, and it is impossible for him to be faithful unless he be diligent.</P>
<P>Ministers, young Ministers especially, must give diligent Attendance to reading and study, that they may grow in Knowledge, and in all ministerial Ac∣complishments, that their profiting may appear to all, and in all things They should also be diligent to know the State of their Flocks, that they may be able to give to every one their Portion in due Season: And should be laying hold of every Opportunity of doing Good to them, by instructing them, by inculcating
<PB N="34" REF="004111_0036_1003D3EC3A703098"/>
their Duty upon them, by warning, counselling and comforting of them, as there is Occasion.</P>
<P>In a Word, There must be <HI>Line upon Line, Line upon Line; Precept upon Precept, Precept upon Precept; here a little, and there a little,</HI> dropping continually from Ministers for the Good of Souls. And so, in short, their main Study must be how to win Souls, This must take up their Thoughts when at home, or when they are abroad, when they rise up and when they lay down, when they are riding or wal∣king by the Way; for as this is the Business they are devoted unto, so, if they be wise they will make a Business of it, and give themselves <HI>wholly</HI> to these Things, and willingly spend and be spent in this im∣portant Service.</P>
<P N="5">5 thly, Another Instance of Wisdom in winning Souls is to be <HI>very prayerful.</HI></P>
<P>For, considering there is so much Skill and Wisdom necessary to win Souls, and that this cometh forth from the Lord of Hosts that is <HI>wonderful in Counsel;</HI> and considering further, that after all our Wisdom, it is GOD who by his Spirit and Grace wins the Soul over to Christ; any Minister that is wise will see that he has such a Dependance upon GOD, both for Assistance and Success in his Ministry, that he wont pretend to go on in it, without earnest seeking to GOD for Help and Grace to he vouchsased unto him, unto those that hear him.</P>
<P>When a Minister seriously considers the arduous and important Business that he is engaging in, he will be ready to cry with the Apostle, 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 216 <HI>And who is sufficent for these Things?</HI> and will hum∣bly and earnestly cry unto GOD for Wisdom and Grace that may be sufficient for him. He will take Encouragement from those gracious Words, Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack</HI> WISDOM, <HI>let him ask of GOD, who
<PB N="35" REF="004111_0037_1003D3FB247FE328"/>
giveth to all Men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him;</HI> and will accordingly cry after Wisdom, and lift up his Voice for Understanding, that he may know how to go in and out before the People he is set over in the Lord; how to manage their various Tempers, and deal with their Souls so as to win and save them. He will pray for Direc∣tion and Assistance in his Studies, and in every Ser∣mon that he composes, that he may be led into Truth, that he may be kept from Errors, and that such things may be dictated to his Mind as shall be seasonable and profitable to the Souls of those that hear him, and to his own Soul; and that he may be assisted and directed in all his Administrations.</P>
<P>But then, being sensible also that his Learning, his Wisdom, and Skill, will signify nothing, without the setting in of divine Grace upon the Souls of Men, this is what he will be much in Prayer to God for, that the divine Spirit may go forth with all the Means that he is using for the winning Souls; acknowledging with the Apostle, 1 Cor. 3.7. <HI>That neither is he that planteth any thing, neither be that watereth, but God that giveth the Increase.</HI></P>
<P>So that Ministers if they would be wise must be Men of <HI>Prayer.</HI> And as the high Priest of old was to bear the Names of the Children of Israel upon his Heart in the Breast Plate of Judgment, when he went into the holy Place before the Lord, (<HI>Exod.</HI> 28. 29.) so Ministers should bear their People upon their Hearts when they appear before God in Prayers, and should be far from thinking it lost time that is spent, in spread∣ing the Cases of their People before GOD, commend∣ing them to his Mercy and Grace. GOD is my Wit∣ness (says the Apostle) whom I serve with my Spirit in the Gospel of his Son, <HI>that without</HI> CEASING <HI>I make Mention of you</HI> ALWAYS <HI>in my</HI> PRAYERS, Rom. 1.9.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="004111_0038_1003D4060CB96A70"/>But it is high Time that I proceed to the APPLI∣CATION AND IMPROVEMENT of these Things. And here, although the foregoing Heads would afford us many useful Inferences, yet I shall only hint at a few which the present Occasion calls for.</P>
<P N="1">I. Is it the special Business of Ministers to win Souls; How should this <HI>recommend the Office, and those who are faithful in it, to the Esteem, Honour, and Love of the People?</HI></P>
<P>What Office is there more glorious and more en∣dearing than this of winning Souls? This was the great Errand Christ came into the World upon, even to seek and save lost Souls. And as the Thought of this should endear Christ unto us, so should it Gospel-Ministers, who (under him) come upon the same Design. What more high, noble, and generous Im∣ployment, than to show Men the Way to Salvation, and perswade Men into it? And how welcome should such be to a People, that come to save their Souls from Death, to gain them over to Christ to Heaven and Happiness? Is not the Soul exceeding precious, of more Worth than all the World? And is it not of infinitely greater Importance to every Man to save his Soul than gain the World? How thankful then should we be, that Christ has appointed an Or∣der of Men for this very Purpose; and how should every one, that is faithful in this Office, be welcome to our very Souls? And how insensible are they of the preciousness of their own Souls, and of their lost and perishing State, who undervalue the Mi∣nistry as a needless Office, and despise Ministers?</P>
<P>Indeed as for such as disparage their Office by their unskilfulness, unfaithfulness, and corrupt Prac∣tices; I have nothing to say for them. But I would say, it is Pity the Ministry in general should be blamed, should be undervalued, upon the Account of such.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="004111_0039_1003D40FDD525CE8"/>And those holy Souls who have been won thro' the Ministry of the Word, will honour and love those that have been the Instruments of their Conversion; yea, and every faithful Minister of Christ, saying as in Rom. 10. 15. <HI>How beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Gospel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Is there a great deal of Wisdom requisite to the winning Souls? Hence <HI>this Business ought to be com∣mitted only to wise Men.</HI></P>
<P>For, to what Purpose will it be to commit the Care of Souls to such as are unskilfull in the Word of Righteousness, or that would be unfaithful in the Work? These would disparage the Office, frustrate the Design of their holy Calling, and so would deceive and destroy, rather than gain and save Men's Souls.</P>
<P>And surely, Considering the Importance of the Bu∣sinss, that it relates to Men's Souls, the future and eternal Salvation of them, it must needs be highly incumbent upon all that are concerned in chusing and putting Men into the Ministry, to act with the grea∣test Care.</P>
<P>Here let me say, a People should be very careful in the Choice of one to whom they commit the Care of their Souls, and of the Souls of their Chil∣dren. They should not proceed suddenly in such a weighty Affair; should get the best Advice they can, and should be well satisfied of a Man's Wisdom and Skill in the Art of winning Souls, before they make Choice of him. This Art of winning Souls is the grand ministerial Gift, and should be <HI>earnestly cove∣ted</HI> by a People.</P>
<P>And then, As to those who have the Power of in∣troducing and investing any with that sacred Office, they ought not <HI>to lay Hands suddenly on any Man,</HI> but should be well satisfied of his having a good Fa∣culty
<PB N="38" REF="004111_0040_1003D4172C890428"/>
at winning Souls; that he be well furnished with Knowledge to direct and guide Men to Christ, and with Arguments to perswade, and be able to use them in such a Manner as would convince the Judgment, and move the Passions, conveying (like the Sun) Light and Heat at the same Time; and that he be disposed to lay himself out, and employ all his Skill for this grand Design.</P>
<P>The Apostle's Charge to <HI>Timothy,</HI> was to commit this Work to <HI>faithful</HI> Men, that shoud be <HI>able</HI> to teach others, 2 Tim. 2.2. And who those faithful Men are, and the particular Qualifications necessary for those that are to be brought into the ministerial Office, we have laid down by the same Apostle as a Directory to his Son <HI>Timothy, 1st</HI> Epistle <HI>3d</HI> Chapter at the Beginning.</P>
<P N="3">III. We learn what is the peculiar Accomplishment those should be seeking after, that are devoted to the Work of the Ministry, namely, <HI>the Art of winning Souls.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Art that every Candidate for the Mi∣nistry should be learning, and that every Minister should be perfecting himself in continually.</P>
<P>We should learn the Art of explaining Doc∣trines and Duties, and of urging Faith and Prac∣tice, with the most moving Arguments. We must get acquainted with the Structure of humane Na∣ture, and with the several Ways of working upon the various Powers and Faculties of our Constitution. We must learn how to inlighten and convince the Understanding and Judgment, how to perswade the Will, and strike the Passions, yea, and the Senses too. We must learn to know Men, and what kind of Address will best suit them, and so must know how to accommodate ourselves, and all our Instructions and Exhortations, to the several Tempers and Ca∣pacities of Men. And lastly, We must learn the Art of
<PB N="39" REF="004111_0041_1003D41DA32B18F8"/>
living well ourselves; whereby we shall represent Religion in the most amiable Light, and recommend it most effectually to others.</P>
<P>And now, DEAR SIR,</P>
<P>Since this is the very Business you are entring upon and engaging in, even to WIN SOULS to Christ, and save them from Death, and since this is the Time for your <HI>publick and solemn Introduction into this sacred Office, by Prayer, and the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</HI> I must say a few things to you.</P>
<P>And first of all, I hope that you yourself are won and gained over to Christ. For with what Face, or with what Prospect of Success, can any undertake to perswade others over to Christ and to his Gospel, with such Arguments as he himself has never felt the Force of?</P>
<P>I trust you are perswaded of the Truth, and convinced of the Reasonableness of, and actually in love with, that Religion which you are to recommend to the Faith, the Love, and Practice of others; and that you can set forth the Excellencies of it from your own happy Experience: and with what Advan∣tages will you urge &amp; perswade this People to be reli∣gious, if you can let them know from your own Ex∣perience, that the <HI>Ways of Religion are Ways of Plea∣santness, and all her Paths Peace.</HI></P>
<P>You are about to have a great Trust committed to you; even that which is more valuable than any Thing in this lower World. <HI>Not the Estates of Men:</HI> for as our Master did not, much less should his Mini∣sters, undertake to be Judges, and Dividers among the People: And therefore the less you meddle with these Things the better. Nor are the Bodies of Men to be committed to your Care: they must when dis∣eased be left to the Physician, under GOD the great Physician of all. But they are the Souls of Men, precious Souls, immortal Souls, one of which is worth
<PB N="40" REF="004111_0042_1003D425DD3E1968"/>
a World, that is to be committed to your Charge: And you are to watch for them as one that must give an Account. They are to be committed to you as a Worker together with GOD, to win them over to Christ, to deliver them out of their lost and perishing State, and perswade them to be happy. A glorious Work indeed! What an high and honourable Call∣ing is this, to have to do with Men's Souls, and be the Instrument of their Salvation? The Angels think it their Honour to <HI>Minister unto them who shall be Heirs of Salvation,</HI> Heb. 1.14. In what an humble and adoring Manner should you then say to GOD, <HI>who am I, and what is my Fathers House that thou hast brought me hither unto?</HI> 2 Sam. 7.18.</P>
<P>But then, Consider the Difficulty as well as Dig∣nity of the Office; it is to win Souls, corrupt and wicked Souls, from their corrupt and sinful State, and from all the corrupt Practices they have been accustomed unto: and what more difficult than to change Men's Natures, and turn them from their evil Customs? Moreover; You may depend upon having the Devil with all his cursed Legions, corrupt Nature with all its wicked and unreasonable Lusts, the Men of the World with all their enticing Arts, the Things of the World and all the corrupt Customs and Practices of it opposing you, with all their Subtilty and Power. And how do you think you shall be able to rescue poor Souls out of the Hands of so many subtle and powerful Adversaries as these? Surely the Thought of this might well dis∣courage you from the Undertaking, were it not for the Assurance that HE, who is with you, is stronger than all those that be against you. But oh! the Knowledge, the Skill, the Wisdom you will need continually to manage with Success in the Affair! This Art of winning Souls is the most difficult to be learnt
<PB N="41" REF="004111_0043_1003D436972DBB28"/>
of any, it requires more Understanding, and Prudence, and Patience, and Meekness, and Humility, and Self-denial to manage it to good, Purpose, than any other Calling. You must therefore be repairing continually to the Fountain <HI>and Father of Lights;</HI> from whom every good Gift and every perfect Gift descends. And altho' we trust you are in some good Measure qualified herefor; yet let me tell you, it is an Art that you may be growing in as long as you live; and as in other so in this divine Art, <HI>Ob∣servation &amp; Experience</HI> will give you great Advantage.</P>
<P>Wherefore now set yourself to the Business with all your Might, that you may grow more and more perfect in this excellent Art, and may be instrumen∣tal in winning and saving those Souls in your Flock that you see are perishing. And, that you may dis∣charge your Office faithfully, and in the most likely Manner to be successful, let me leave two or three Words of Counsel with you.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>Always distinguish between winning, over to</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and to a particular</HI> PARTY. Don't think that the bringing Men over to a particular Opinion, as to some doctrinal or disciplinary Points; or to a particular Side in a Controversy, and a Quarrel, is the winning them over to Christ: for Men's being on the wrong or the right Side in controversial Points, don't determine which Side they are on, with respect to Christ and the Salvation of their Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Use no other Arts in perswading over to Christ than those that <HI>the Gospel will bear you out in, which are fair and honest, just and true. Don't speak wickedly for GOD, nor talk deceitfully for him,</HI> Job. 13.7. Take Pattern by the Apostles, who say, <HI>We are not as many who corrupt the Word, or deal deceit∣fully with the Word, but as of Sincerity, but as of GOD,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor. 2.17. <HI>Seeing we have received this Ministry as
<PB N="42" REF="004111_0044_1003D44663B83DC8"/>
we have obtained Mercy we faint not, but have re∣nounced the hidden Things of Dishonesty, not walking in Craftiness, not handling the Word of GOD deceitfully, but by Manifestation of the Truth, commending ourselves to every Man's Conscience, in the Sight of GOD,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.2. You may not use any flattering Dissimulations or Deceits, to win Men over to Christ: This would be to <HI>Steal</HI> Men's Hearts (as <HI>Absalom</HI> did the Hearts of the Men of <HI>Israel</HI>) rather than fairly win them. The Cause of Christ requires no dissembling about it, and Honesty will always be found to be the best Po∣licy. Indeed it is frequently mentioned as an Ar∣gument to justify some kind of Guile and Deceit in winning and perswading Men to Christ, that the A∣postle <HI>Paul</HI> says of the <HI>Corinthians, That he being crafty caught them with Guile,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.16. But they mistake the Apostle, for he therein only tells them what evil Surmises and Suggestions there were among them concerning him, and that it was their Suggestion among themselves that he had caught them with Guile; that is they insinuate, that altho' he did not Burden them by calling for any Money from them, yet, that he was crafty, and set others to take Money of them for his Use; but this he ut∣terly denies in the two following Verses. So that this Text don't give the least Countenance to the using any Guile or Deceit in winning Souls; for the Apostle denies that ever he did so, and mentions it only as a bare Surmise of others.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, and lastly. <HI>See that you have an impartial Re∣gard to the Souls of all committed to your Charge.</HI> Don't let any Soul suffer thro' Cowardice or Contempt. Don't neglect the Souls of the Rich and Great thro' fear of offending; but remember that if they loose their Souls, their worldly Riches will by no Means answer in Exchange for them: therefore in a friendly
<PB N="43" REF="004111_0045_1003D44EA49FC350"/>
faithful Manner, endeavour that they may not have all their good Things in this Life. And don't let the Poor be despised and sink below your particular Watch and Care; but remember that their Souls are equally precious with the Souls of others, and endea∣vour that those who are poor in this Word may be rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>And now, What shall I say unto you, to put you upon the utmost Faithfulness and Diligence in this Business? You know the Worth of Souls, you know the inestimable Price that has been paid for their Ransom, and that such corruptible Things as Silver and Gold could not redeem them. You know also that if they perish thro' your Neglect, their Blood will be required at your Hand: Whereas if you are but the Means of winning, converting, and saving them, what a Joy and Crown of Rejoycing would they be to you? What a Comfort will they be to you in this World? For if you win their Souls over to Christ, you will gain a great Share of their Af∣fections to yourself; so that you need not to be con∣cerned to secure the Affections and Kindnesses of your People, any other Way than by winning them o∣ver to Christ; for such will think nothing too much to do, according to their Ability, for the honourable and comfortable Support of him that GOD has made the Instrument hereof.</P>
<P>But then, What a Glory will such Souls be to you hereafter? How will they love and thank you, and how will they praise GOD and Christ for you, throughout Eternity? Verily, Every such Soul shall be like so many Pearls and precious Diamonds, set in that unfading Crown of Glory, which you shall receive when the chief Shepherd shall appear: <HI>For they that be Wise shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteousness as the Stars forever and ever,</HI> Dan. 12.3.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="004111_0046_1003D45B00C0CF60"/>I shall conclude with a brief Address to the <HI>Church and Congregation,</HI> at whose Desire, and upon whose Account, we are met together at this Time. You have been seeking and praying to the GOD of the Spirits of all Flesh, to set a Man over the Congrega∣tion, that may go in before you, and go out before you in spiritual Things. And now <HI>behold the</HI> MAN; The <HI>Man</HI> whom, we trust, the Lord hath chosen for you. He is coming among you (we trust) not to seek yours but you; not to get your worldly Riches, but to gain your precious Souls. With what Esteem then, and hearty Affection, should you receive him?</P>
<P>Surely, Since he comes to seek and win your Souls, you ought to open them unto him, and let him into them, that is, into the Affections of them; yea, and into the Circumstances of them, so far as is necessary for his working and winning upon them.</P>
<P>I charitably hope that many of you, according to your Profession, are already won over to Christ; and then his Business, as to you, will be to strengthen your Faith, your Love, and Obedience to Christ, and cause you to grow in Grace, and to abound more and more in the Fruits of Righteousness; even to build them up in Faith, Holiness, and Comfort unto Salvation.</P>
<P>And as for those of you that are yet in your Sins, and have not as yet been perswaded over to Christ, see that you be won by his Counsels &amp; his good Conversa∣tion in Christ. Don't harden your Hearts against the moving Arguments that he shall offer unto you: For I beseech you, what is it that he will endeavour to win you over to, but to Christ and Happiness? Will be perswade you to any thing that will be for your Hurt, or that which will be for your greatest Good; even for your Peace, Honour and Comfort here, and for your Glory and Happiness hereafter? Wherefore
<PB N="45" REF="004111_0047_1003D466284EB9C0"/>
don't let him have any Reason to complain that he labours in vain, and spends his Strength for nought; take heed of every thing that shall grieve him, or that shall discourage him in his Work.</P>
<P>He is <HI>young and tender,</HI> and ye had need do all ye can to strengthen his Hands and encourage his Heart, by living in Love, and Peace with him, and one with another. Beware of Discord among your selves, or with your Minister.</P>
<P>Let the sore Contentions that have been of late among you, and which have rent you to pieces, be a perpetual Warning to you, to guard against the beginning of Strife, and to leave off Contention be∣fore it be meddled with.</P>
<P>And here let me say, That altho' your Contenti∣ons have been so sharp as to put you and your Bre∣thren asunder, yet ye must by no Means loose all your Charity and Affection for them. You must exercise a forgiving Spirit towards them, as you hope that they would exercise the same towards you, and as you hope that GOD will forgive you. For those Divisions there had need be great searchings of Heart on all Sides, and every one ought to be jealous and fearful least he has done amiss in those Days and Years of Temptation.</P>
<P>And here I would say for all, (because I don't intend to meddle with those thorny Points) that the more humble and jealous you are of yourselves, the more charitable, meek, and condescending to∣wards your Neighbours, and the more careful you are that no Injustice be done them, the more evident it will be that you are won over to Christ, for this is the Spirit of Christ and of his Gospel. <HI>Put on therefore, as the Elect of GOD, holy and beloved, Bowels of Mercy, Kindness, Humbleness of Mind, Meekness, Long-suffering, forbearing one another, and
<PB N="46" REF="004111_0048_1003D46E3AE06728"/>
forgiving one another: If any Man has a Quarrel a∣gainst any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye; and above all things put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectness; and let the Peace of GOD rule in your Hearts, to the which also ye are called in one Body and be ye thankful,</HI> Col. 3.12, —15. <HI>And now the GOD of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everlasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work, to do his Will; working in you that which is well pleasing in his Sight, thro' Jesus Christ, to whom be Glory forever and ever,</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Right Hand of FELLOWSHIP.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the thrusting forth Labourers into His Har∣vest, is to be ascribed to the Care, Grace, and Faithfulness of the Lord Jesus Christ, the so∣vereign Head of the Church; so there is a wonderful Wisdom, Goodness and Conde∣scention discovered in the Order and Manner wherein this is done by Him: He having vested his Churches with a gracious Liberty of chusing, from amongst those, whom the Head of Influences, has raised up, qualified, and disposed to that sacred Employment, such, as upon their sincere and ardent Addresses to Him for Direction, and the Exercise of their own best Judgment and Discretion, they shall think most likely to promote the great Ends of GOD's Glory, and the Good of precious Souls, in the midst of them.</P>
<P>That the Churches of Christ are by Him vested with this Liberty, and indulg'd this Privilege, is evident from their Usage in the primitive Times of Christianity; and may be fairly argued even from the sacred Scriptures themselves: and particularly from <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. which Text rendered in our Translation, <HI>And when they had ordained them Elders in every City,</HI> is rendered by Rev <HI>Beza, Quum{que} ipsis per suffragia cr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssent per singulas Ecclesias Presbyteros</HI> i. e. When they had by the Susstages or Votes of the People created them Elders in every Church. And that this Trans∣lation is just, has been allow'd and pleaded by many, the best Expositors, who have understood and well considered the Import of the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, used in the Text.</P>
<P>And however this Priviledge or Liberty of electing their own Pastors, has on occasion of the Abuse of it by the Churches themselves, or the assuming Disposition of those who have had the Ascendency over them, or both, been ta∣ken away from many of the Churches of our Lord Jesus Christ; the taking away whereof is, by Rev. <HI>Calvin,</HI> stiled
<PB N="50" REF="004111_0052_1003D48FDA8DCA60"/>
<HI>Impia Ecclesiae spoliatio</HI> (an ungodly robbing the Church) Yet the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> have hitherto enjoyed the quiet Possesion of it. And may it please GOD to di∣rect and enable them always so to use the same, as that they may not, by a sinful Inconsideration, Rashness, Partiality, and factious Behaviour, provoke our compassionate Re∣deemer to suffer them to be divested of it.</P>
<P>It is too notorious to be dissembled that in the Elections of Pastors in some of our Churches and Congregations, there has been a lamentable Loose given to Men's Hu∣mours, Lusts, and Passions; than which there can scarce be named a more awful Evidence of the Decay of vital Piety, or a more pregnant Symptom of the Withdrawings of the gracious Presence of Christ from His People. Yet, never∣theless (and to GOD's Praise be it spoken!) we have had from time to time many Instances, wherein, making the necessary Abatements for humane Frailty, this Transaction has been proceeded to and managed in our Churches, with a Seriousness and Order, agreable to the Importance of the Matter, and becoming a People so much indulg'd and highly favoured of the Lord</P>
<P>And it is Matter of Rejoycing to us, that we have beheld so much of the Fruits of the Spirit of Christ, in that Order, Peace, and Unanimity, with which you, our honoured and dear Brethren in Christ, have proceeded in your Choice of the worthy Person now set over you in the Lord</P>
<P>And having seen you now renewedly signify your De∣sires of him for your Pastor, and heard him, with an express Dependence upon Christ the glorious Head of Influences, complying with your Desires herein, and devoting himself to the evangelical Ministry; yea further, having seen him in a solemn Manner seperated or ordained to the pastoral Office, by Prayer and laying on of the Hands of the Pres∣bytery. — There can remain no imaginable Ground, whereupon to withhold from him, those Acknowledgments, Wishes Hopes and Promises, which have been wont to be express'd by the Eldership, unto such as from time to time it hath pleased our ascended Lord to add unto their Number.</P>
<P>Which therefore, being thereto deputed, (tho' unworthy of a standing amongst them) I shall now, in the Name of the Eldership, express, by giving you, Reverend and Dear SIR, <HI>The Right Hand of our Fellowship;</HI> hereby testifying
<PB N="51" REF="004111_0053_1003D49CB7A6DF38"/>
our Gratitude to the great Head of the Church, our Lord Jesus Christ, for those ministerial Gifts and Graces we per∣ceive to be in you; Our sincere Wishes, that they may con∣tinued, increased and multiplied upon you; and our Hopes, that you will so employ them all, as to approve yourself a <HI>Workman that need not be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>We would also hereby be understood to express our Sa∣tisfaction in your call to the Gospel Ministry, and to own and assert the Validity and Fulness of your Ordination to that sacred Office. And that thereupon we own you as a Bishop, Elder, or Pastor, in the Church of Christ, specially in this Part of it, over which, as we trust, the Holy Ghost hath now made you an Overseer; and that with hearty Love and Affection, we receive you into the Fellowship of our Ministry, and as our Equal in Point of Office.</P>
<P>Assuring you, That, as GOD shall enable and need re∣quire, we shall readily give you the Assistance of our Prayers and Advice from time to time, and shall always re∣joyce to see the Work of the Lord prospering in your Hands.</P>
<P>And now, Reverend and Dear Brother, suffer me to ob∣serve to you, That we take your thus receiving the Right Hand of our Fellowship, as expressive on your Part of the same Acknowledgments, Wishes, Hopes and Promises, to∣wards us. And may it please GOD to help you and us, to bear in Mind these mutual and endearing Engagements, for the strengthening our holy Fellowship, and not suffer them to pass away as Words of Course or an empty Formality.</P>
<P>Verily, SIR, from our own Experience we can assure you, the Work you are engaged in is a laborious &amp; difficult Work: A Work wherein you must expect to meet with great Opposition: A Work therefore in order to the due Discharge whereof you must arm yourself with Patience and Resolution, always relying upon Christ, in whom all ful∣ness dwells, and remembring that you watch for Men's Souls as one that must give an Account.</P>
<P>And may it please our glorious Redeemer, always to af∣ford his promised Presence with you, and to cause his Grace to be sufficient for you! May you be wise to win Souls, and instrumental of turning many unto Righteousness, who may be your Hope, your Joy and Crown of Rejoycing, in the Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His Coming.</P>
