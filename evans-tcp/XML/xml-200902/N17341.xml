<L>THE women all tell me I am false to my lass,</L>
<L>That I quit my poor Chloe, and stick to my glass!</L>
<L>But to you men of reason, my reason I'll own,</L>
<L>And if you don't like 'em, why let them alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Altho' I have left her, the truth I'll declare,</L>
<L>I believe she was good, and I am sure she was fair;</L>
<L>But such goodness and charms in a bumper I see,</L>
<L>That makes it as good and as charming as she.</L>
</LG>

<L>My Chloe had dimples and smiles I must own;</L>
<L>But tho' she could smile, yet in truth she could frown;</L>
<L>But tell me, ye lovers of liquor divine,</L>
<L>Did you e'er see a frown in a bumper of wine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her lilies and roses were just in their prime,</L>

<L>But wine, from its age such a benefit flows,</L>
<L>That I like it the better the older it grows.</L>

<L>They tell me in time that my love will be cloy'd.</L>
<L>And that beauty is insipid when once 'tis enjoy'd;</L>
<L>But in wine, I both time and enjoyment defy,</L>
<L>For the longer I drink the more thirsty am I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps like their sex ever false to their word,</L>
<L>She had left me to get an estate or a lord:</L>
<L>But my bottle regardless of titles or pelf,</L>
<L>Will stand by me when I can't stand by myself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She too might have poison'd the joys of my life</L>
<L>With nurses and children, and squalling and strife:</L>
<L>But my wine neither nurses nor babes can me bring,</L>
<L>For a big-belly'd bottle's a mighty fine thing.</L>

<HEAD>THE SORROWS OF CHARLOTTE ON THE DEATH OF WERTER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Werter first fair Charlotte saw,</L>
<L>What strange emotions seiz'd his breast,</L>
<L>And rob'd him too for e'er of rest,</L>
<L>By force of love's despotic law:</L>
<L>Then oft he'd seek the willow grove,</L>
<L>And as he'd thro' the coverts rove,</L>
<L>Oh how he'd sigh, he'd sigh for guilty love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then back return with eager pace,</L>
<L>And Charlotte, Charlotte, mournful cry,</L>
<L>The while he would so sadly sigh,</L>
<L>That tears would trickle down his face:</L>
<L>And when she saw him thus in woe.</L>
<L>She'd sweetly whisper soft and low,</L>
<L>Oh how I grieve, I grieve to see you so!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His fatal passion oft she'd chide,</L>
<L>That both their sad misfortunes wrought,</L>
<L>When fate the doleful tidings brought,</L>
<L>For love of Charlotte, Werter dy'd:</L>
<L>Oh how she cry'd in bitter woe,</L>
<L>How could you, Werter, pain me so,</L>
<L>Oh how I grieve the world thy death must know!</L>

<L>The merry dance, the cheerful song,</L>

<L>IF love's a sweet passion, how can it torment?</L>
<L>If bitter, O tell me whence comes my content?</L>
<L>Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain,</L>
<L>Or grieve at my fate, since I know 'tis in vain?</L>

<L>That at once it both wounds me and tickles my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I grasp her hand gently, look languishing down.</L>
<L>And by passionate silence I make my love known:</L>
<L>But, oh! how I'm blest when so kind she does prove,</L>
<L>By some willing mistake to discover her love:</L>
<L>When, in striving to hide, she reveals all her flame,</L>

<L>YE sluggards, who murder your life time in sleep,</L>
<L>Awake and pursue the fleet hare;</L>
<L>From life say what joy, say what pleasure you reap,</L>
<L>That e'er could with hunting compare.</L>
<L>When Phoebus begins to enlighten the morn,</L>
<L>The huntsman unkennels his hounds,</L>
<L>Enraptur'd we glow at the sound of the horn,</L>
<L>Whilst the woods the sweet echo resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The courtier, the lawyer, the priest, has his view,</L>
<L>Nay, every profession the same;</L>
<L>But sportsmen, ye mortals, no pleasure pursue,</L>
<L>But such as accrue from the game.</L>
<L>While drunkards are pleas'd in the joys of the cup,</L>
<L>And turn into day every night,</L>
<L>At the break of each morn the huntsman is up,</L>
<L>And bounds o'er the lands with delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then quickly, my lads, to the forest repair,</L>
<L>O'er dales and o'er valleys let's fly;</L>
<L>For who can, ye gods, feel a moment of care,</L>
<L>When pursuing the hounds in full cry.</L>
<L>Thus each morning, each day, in raptures we pass,</L>
<L>And desire no comfort to share,</L>
<L>But at night to refresh with the bottle and glass,</L>
<L>And feed on the spoil of the hare.</L>
