AND WHEREAS, the Great and General Court or Assembly of the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> aforesaid, have elected and appointed you to represent and appear for the said Province, at the Convention aforesaid, for the Purposes above-mentioned. As also, for entering into Articles of Union and Confederation, with the aforesaid Government, for the general Defence of His Majesty's Subjects and Interests in <HI>North-America,</HI> as well in Times of Peace as War.</P>

<P><Q>THEREFORE in Pursuance of the said Act of Assembly, you the said <HI>William Pitkin, Roger Wolcot,</HI> jun. and <HI>Elisha Williams,</HI> <ABBR>Esqrs</ABBR> are commissioned, authorized, and impowered, in Behalf of His Majesty's Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to meet the Commissioners appointed by His Majesty's other Governments in <HI>America,</HI> at <HI>Albany,</HI> on the 14th of <HI>June</HI> next; and in Concert with such Commissioners, from His Majesty's other Governments, as shall meet there, to consult proper Measures for the general Defence and Safety of His Majesty's Subjects in said Governments, and the <HI>Indians</HI> in his Alliance, against the <HI>French,</HI> and their <HI>Indians:</HI> And to use and pursue proper Measures in Pursuance of your Instructions from the said General Assembly, relating the Matter aforesaid.</Q></P>
<P>PARAGRAPH in the Commission given by the Honorable <HI>Horatio Sharpe,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieutenant Governor of the Province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> to their Commissioners.</P>
<P><Q>AND WHEREAS, I have had Intimation, that the Commissioners from the several neighbouring Colonies, will receive In∣structions from their respective Governments, to concert Measures with the Commissioners from the other Provinces, for the better securing these <HI>Indians</HI> for the future, in our Alliance, and prevent∣ing their being alienated from our Interest, by the Artifices or Insinuations of our Enemies, as well as for the more easy Defence of His Majesty's Dominions on this Continent. You shall, if any Propositions of that Nature are made by the Commissioners, in Behalf of their respective Governments, let them know, that this Province is also disposed to contribute to the Execution of any general Scheme to promote such desirable Ends.</Q></P>
<P>PARAGRAPH of a Letter from the Earl of <HI>Holdernesse,</HI> one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State; dated at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 28th of <HI>August,</HI> 1753, directed to the Governor and Company of <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI></P>
<P><Q>AND WHEREAS, it may be greatly conducive to His Majesty's Service, that all his Provinces in <HI>America,</HI> should be aiding and assisting each other, in Case of any Invasion: I have it particularly
<PB N="3" REF="007433_0003_102D85FDE7794D08"/>in Charge from His Majesty, to acquaint you, That it His Royal Will and Pleasure, that you should keep up an exact Correspon∣dence with all His Majesty's Governors on the Continent.</Q></P>
<P>Two Paragraphs of a Letter from the Right Honorable the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations; dated at <HI>White∣hall,</HI> the 18th of <HI>September,</HI> 1753. directed to Sir <HI>Danvers Osborne,</HI> Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> and laid before the Commissioners at <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P><Q>WHEN we consider of how great Consequence the Friend∣ship and Alliance of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> is, to all His Majesty's Colonies and Plantations in <HI>America</HI> in general, as well as to <HI>New-York</HI> in particular: When we consider, that this Friendship and Alliance is only to be gained and preserved by making Pre∣sents to them at proper Times, and upon proper Occasions; and by an inviolable Observance of all our Engagements with them: And when we recollect the Attempts which have been lately made, to withdraw them from the <HI>British</HI> Interest, we cannot but be greatly concerned and surprized, that the Province of <HI>New-York</HI> should have been so inattentive to the general Interest of His Majesty's Subjects in <HI>America,</HI> as well as to their own par∣ticular Security, as to have given Occasion to the Complaints made by the <HI>Indians;</HI> but we are still more surprized, at the Manner in which these Complaints were received, the dissatis∣factory Answers given to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and at their being suffered to depart (tho' the Assembly was then sitting) without any Measures taken to bring them to Temper, or to redress their Complaints. — 'And this leads us to recommend one Thing more to your Attention, and that is, to take Care, that all the Provinces be (if practicable) comprised in one General Treaty, to be made in His Majesty's Name; it appearing to us, that the Practice of each Province making a separate Treaty for itself, in its own Name, is very improper, and may be attended with great Inconveniency to His Majesty's Subjects.</Q></P>
<P>PARAGRAPH of a Letter from Sir <HI>Thomas Robinson,</HI> one of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State; dated <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 5th of <HI>July,</HI> 1754. directed to the Governor and Company of <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI></P>
<P><Q>ALTHOUGH you have neglected to give any Answer to the Earl of <HI>Holdernesse</HI>'s Letter of the 28th of <HI>August</HI> last, yet as I cannot doubt of your Receipt of that Letter, wherein the King's Orders were signified to you, not only to act vi∣gorously in Defence of your Government, but to be likewise aiding and assisting His Majesty's other Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> to repel any hostile Attempts made against them; I am now, by the King's express Command, to enforce to you the said Di∣rections, in the strongest Manner, and to acquaint you, that His Majesty expects your immediate Observance of them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007433_0004_102D85FFA28C3D00"/>
Two Paragraphs of a Letter from the same Sir <HI>Thomas Robin∣son;</HI> dated at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> the 26th of <HI>October,</HI> 1754. directed to the Governor and Company of <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI></P>
<P><Q>AND cannot fail to excite you to exert yourself, and those under your Care, to take the most vigorous Steps to repel your common Danger, and to shew that the King's Orders which were sent you last Year by the Earl of <HI>Holdernesse,</HI> and were re∣newed to you in my Letter of the 5th of <HI>July,</HI> have at last roused that Emulation and Spirit that every Man owes at this Time to His Majesty, the Public, and himself. — But with Regard to such other Articles which are of a more general Con∣cern, It is His Majesty's Pleasure, That the same should be sup∣plyed by a common Fund, to be established for the Benefit of all the Colonies collectively, in <HI>North-America:</HI> For which Pur∣pose, you will use your utmost Endeavours, to induce the Assem∣bly of your Province, to raise forthwith as large a Sum as can be afforded, as their Contribution to this common Fund, to be em∣ployed provisionally, for the general Service of <HI>North-America,</HI> (particularly for paying the Charge of levying the Troops to make up the Complement of the Regiments above-mentioned) until such Time as a Plan of general Union of His Majesty's Northern Colonies, for their common Defence, can be perfected.</Q></P>

<HEAD>At a MEETING, &amp;c. on Tuesday, 9th <HI>July,</HI> 1754.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, The Hon. the Lieutenant GOVERNOR of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the Four GENTLEMEN of the Council of <HI>New-York:</HI> And all the COMMISSIONERS, except Mr. FRANKLIN, absent by his Appointment in the Morning.</P>
<P>THE Draught of the Representation, &amp;c. was read and con∣sidered, Paragraph by Paragraph, some Amendments made, and the whole was agreed to, and ordered to be minuted as follows.</P>
<P>THAT His Majesty's Title to the Northern Continent of <HI>America,</HI> appears to be sounded on the Discovery thereof first made, and the Possession thereof first taken in 1497, under a Commission from <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth of <HI>England,</HI> to <HI>Sebastian Cabot.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> have possessed themselves of several Parts of this Continent, which by Treaties, have been ceded and con∣firmed to them: That the Rights of the <HI>English</HI> to the whole Sea Coast, from <HI>Georgia</HI> on the South, to the River St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> on the North, excepting the Island of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> in the Bay of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> remains plain and indisputable.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007433_0005_102D860189646F28"/>
That all the Lands or Countries Westward from the <HI>Atlantic Ocean</HI> to the <HI>South Sea,</HI> between 48 and 34 Degrees of North Latitude, were expressly included in the Grant of King <HI>James</HI> the First, to divers of his Subjects, so long since, as the Year 1606, and afterwards confirmed in 1620; and under this Grant, the Colony of <HI>Virginia</HI> claims an Extent as far West as to the <HI>South Sea;</HI> and the antient Colonies of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> and <HI>Con∣necticut,</HI> were by their respective Charters, made to extend to the said <HI>South Sea;</HI> so that not only the Right to the Sea Coast, but to all the Inland Countries, from Sea to Sea, have at all Times been asserted by the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>That the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> or <HI>Accadia,</HI> hath known and determinate Bounds, by the original Grant from King <HI>James</HI> the First; and that there is abundant Evidence of the same, and of the Knowledge which the <HI>French</HI> had of these Bounds, while they were in Possession of it; and that these Bounds being thus known, the said Province by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> according to its antient Limits, was ceded to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and remained in Possession thereof, until the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> by which it was confirmed; but by said Treaty it is stipulated, That the Bounds of the said Province shall be determined by Com∣missioners, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the Country of the <HI>Five Cantons</HI> of the <HI>Iroquoise,</HI> is expressly acknowledged to be under the Do∣minion of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That the Lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> formerly called Lake <HI>Iroquoise,</HI> and the Country Southward of it, as far as the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Set∣tlements, the Lake <HI>Ontario, Erie,</HI> and all the Countries adjacent, have by all antient Authors, <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> been allowed to belong to the <HI>Five Cantons</HI> or <HI>Nations;</HI> and the whole of those Countries, long before the said Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> were by the said <HI>Nations,</HI> put under the Protection of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> there is a Reserve to the <HI>French,</HI> a Liberty of frequenting the Countries of the <HI>Five Na∣tions,</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> in Friendship with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the Sake of Commerce; as there is also to the <HI>English,</HI> a Liberty of frequenting the Countries of those in Friendship with <HI>France,</HI> for the same Purpose.</P>
<P>That after the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> built several Fortresses in the Country of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and a very strong one at a Place called <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> to the South of the Lake <HI>Champlain.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> Court have evidently, since the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> made this Northern Continent more than ever, the Object of its Attention.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> have most unjustly taken Possession of a Part of the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia;</HI> and in the River St. <HI>John's,</HI> and other Parts of said Province, they have built strong For∣tresses; and from this River they will have, during the Winter
<PB N="6" REF="007433_0006_102D71D9DA9FA0C8"/>and Spring Season, a much easier Communication between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> than they have heretofore had, and will be furnished with a Harbour more commodiously situated for the Annoying the <HI>British</HI> Colonies by Privateers and Men of War, than <HI>Louis∣bourg</HI> itself.</P>
<P>That they have taken Possession of, and begun a Settlement at the Head of the River <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> within the Bounds of the Province of <HI>Main,</HI> the most convenient Situation for affording Support, and a safe Retreat, to the <HI>Eastern Indians,</HI> in any of their Attempts upon the Governments of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>That is appears by the Information of the Natives, the <HI>French</HI> have been making Preparations for another Settlement, at a Place called <HI>Cobass,</HI> on <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, near the Head thereof, where 'tis but about ten Miles distant from a Branch of <HI>Merri∣mack</HI> River; and from whence, there is a very near and easy Communication with the <HI>Abnekais Indians,</HI> who are settled on the River St. <HI>Francois,</HI> about forty Miles from the River St. <HI>Law∣rence;</HI> and it is certain, the Inhabitants of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> in which Province this <HI>Cohass</HI> is supposed to lie, have been inter∣rupted and impeded by the <HI>French Indians,</HI> from making any Settlement there.</P>
<P>That since the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have in∣creased the Number of their Forts in the Country of the great Lakes, and on the Rivers which run into the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> and are securing a Communication between the two Colonies of <HI>Louisiana</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> and at the same Time, putting themselves into a Capacity of annoying the Southern <HI>British</HI> Colonies, and pre∣venting any further Settlements of His Majesty's Dominions.</P>
<P>That they have been gradually increasing their Troops in <HI>America,</HI> transporting them in their Ships of War, which return to <HI>France</HI> with a bare Complement of Men, leaving the rest in their Colonies; and by this Means, they are less observed by the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> than they would be, if Transports as usual heretofore, were provided for this Purpose.</P>
<P>That they have taken Prisoners diverse of His Majesty's Sub∣jects, trading in the Country of the <HI>Iroquoise,</HI> and other inland Parts, and plundered such Prisoners of several Thousand Pounds Sterling; and they are continually exciting the <HI>Indians</HI> to destroy or make Prisoners the Inhabitants of the Frontiers of the <HI>British</HI> Colonies; which Prisoners are carried to <HI>Canada,</HI> and a Price equal to what Slaves are sold in the Plantations, is demanded for their Redemption and Release.</P>
<P>That they are continually drawing off the <HI>Indians</HI> from the <HI>British</HI> Interest, and have lately perswaded one Half of the <HI>Onon∣dago</HI> Tribe, with many from the other Nations along with them, to remove to a Place called <HI>Oswegachie,</HI> on the River <HI>Cadaracqui,</HI> where they have built them a Church and Fort; and many of the <HI>Senecas,</HI> the most numerous Nation, appear to be wavering, and rather inclined to the <HI>French.</HI> And it is a melancholy Consi∣deration, that not more than 150 Men of all the several Nations,
<PB N="7" REF="007433_0007_102D86039A3B35C0"/>have attended this Treaty, altho' they had Notice, that all the Governments would be here by their Commissioners, and that a large Present would be given.</P>
<P>That it is the evident Design of the <HI>French</HI> to surround the <HI>British</HI> Colonies, to fortify themselves on the Back thereof, to take and keep Possession of the Heads of all the important Rivers, to draw over the <HI>Indians</HI> to their Interest, and with the Help of such <HI>Indians,</HI> added to such Forces as are already arrived, and may be hereafter sent from <HI>Europe,</HI> to be in a Capacity of making a general Attack upon the several Governments; and if at the same Time, a strong Naval Force be sent from <HI>France,</HI> there is the utmost Danger, that the whole Continent will be subjected to that Crown: And that the Danger of such a Naval Force is not meerly imaginary, may be argued from past Experience. For had it not been by the most extraordinary Interposition of Heaven, every Sea Port Town on the Continent, in the Year 1746, might have been ravaged and destroyed, by the Squadron under the Command of the Duke <HI>D'Anville,</HI> notwithstanding the then de∣clining State of the <HI>French,</HI> and the very flourishing State of the <HI>British</HI> Navy, and the further Advantage accruing to the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> from the Possession of <HI>Cape-Breton.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> find by Experience, they are able to make greater and more secure Advantages upon their Neighbours, in Peace than in War. What they unjustly possessed themselves of, after the Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> they now pretend they have a Right to hold, by Virtue of the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> until the true Boundary between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> be settled by Com∣missioners; but their Conquests made during War, they have been obliged to restore.</P>
<P>That the <HI>French</HI> Affairs relative to this Continent, are under one Direction, and constantly regarded by the Crown and Mini∣stry, who are not insensible how great a Stride they would make towards an Universal Monarchy, if the <HI>British</HI> Colonies were added to their Dominions, and consequently the whole Trade of <HI>North-America</HI> engrossed by them.</P>
<P>That the said Colonies being in a divided, disunited State, there has never been any joint Exertion of their Force, or Coun∣cil, to repel or defeat the Measures of the <HI>French;</HI> and particular Colonies are unable and unwilling to maintain the Cause of the whole.</P>
<P>That there has been a very great Neglect of the Affairs of the <HI>Iroquoise,</HI> as they are commonly called, <HI>the Indians of the Six Nations,</HI> and their Friendship and Alliance has been improved to private Purposes, for the Sake of the Trade with them, and the Purchase or Acquisition of their Lands, more than the Public Services.</P>
<P>That they are supplyed with Rum by the Traders, in vast and almost incredible Quantities; the Laws of the Colonies now in Force, being insufficient to restrain the Supply. And the <HI>Indians</HI> of every Nation, are frequently drunk, and abused in their Trade,
<PB N="8" REF="007433_0008_102D860590D41EE8"/>and their Affection thereby alienated from the <HI>English;</HI> they often wound and murder one another in their Liquor, and to avoid Revenge, fly to the <HI>French;</HI> and perhaps more have been lost by these Means, than by the <HI>French</HI> Artifice.</P>
<P>That Purchases of Land from the <HI>Indians</HI> by private Persons, for small trifling Considerations, have been the Cause of great Uneasiness and Discontents; and if the <HI>Indians</HI> are not in fact imposed on and injured, yet they are apt to think they have been; and indeed, they appear not fit to be entrusted at Large, with the Sale of their own Lands: And the Laws of some of the Colonies, which make such Sales void, unless the Allowance of the Government be first obtained, seem to be well founded.</P>
<P>That the Granting or Patenting vast Tracts of Land to pri∣vate Persons or Companies, without Conditions of speedy Set∣tlements, has tended to prevent the Strengthening the Frontiers of the particular Colony where such Tracts lie, and been Preju∣dicial to the rest.</P>
<P>That it seems absolutely necessary, that speedy and effectual Measures be taken, to secure the Colonies from the Slavery they are threatned with; that any farther Advances of the <HI>French</HI> should be prevented; and the Encroachments already made, removed.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance or Friendship with the <HI>English,</HI> be constantly regarded under some wise Direction or Superintend∣ancy. That Endeavours be used for the Recovery of those <HI>In∣dians</HI> who are lately gone over to the <HI>French,</HI> and for securing those that remain. That some discreet Person or Persons be appointed to reside constantly among each Nation of <HI>Indians;</HI> such Person to have no Concern in Trade, and duly to commu∣nicate all Advices to the Superintendants.</P>
<P>That the Trade with the said <HI>Indians</HI> be well regulated, and made subservient to the Public Interest, more than to private Gain.</P>
<P>That there be Forts built for the Security of each Nation, and the better carrying on the Trade with them. That warlike Vessels be provided, sufficient to maintain His Majesty's Right to a free Navigation on the several Lakes.</P>
<P>That all future Purchases of Lands from the <HI>Indians</HI> be void, unless made by the Government where such Lands lie, and from the <HI>Indians</HI> in a Body, in their public Councils. That the Pa∣tentees or Possessors of large unsettled Territories, be enjoined to cause them to be settled in a reasonable Time, on Pain of For∣feiture.</P>
<P>That the Complaints of the <HI>Indians,</HI> relative to any Grants or Possessions of their Lands, fraudulently obtained, be inquired into, and all Injuries redressed.</P>
<P>That the Bounds of those Colonies which extend to the <HI>South Seas,</HI> be contracted and limited by the <HI>Alleghenny</HI> or <HI>Apalachian</HI> Mountains; and that Measures be taken, for settling from time to time, Colonies of His Majesty's Protestant Subjects, Westward
<PB N="9" REF="007433_0009_102D8607A80C9FE0"/>of said Mountains, in convenient Cantons, to he assigned for that Purpose. And finally, that there be an Union of His Majesty's several Governments on the Continent, that so their Councils, Treasure, and Strength, may be imployed in due Proportion, against their common Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>ALL which is submitted.</HI></P>

<P>Who shall meet for the first Time at the City of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> being called by the President General, as soon as conveniently may be, after his Appointment.</P>
<P>That there shall be a new Election of Members for the Grand Council every three Years; and on the Death or Resignation of any Member, his Place shall be supplyed by a new Choice, at the next Sitting of the Assembly of the Colony he represented.</P>
<P>That after the first three Years, when the Proportion of Money arising out of each Colony to the General Treasury, can be known, the Number of Members to be chosen for each Co∣lony, shall from time to time, in all ensuing Elections, be regu∣lated by that Proportion (yet so as that the Number to be chosen by any one Province, be not more than seven, nor less than two).</P>
<P>That the Grand Council shall meet once in every Year, and oftener if Occasion require, at such Time and Place as they shall adjourn to at the last preceding Meeting, of as they shall be called to meet at, by the President General on any Emergency; he having first obtained in writing, the Consent of seven of the Members to such Call, and sent due and timely Notice to the whole.</P>
<P>That the Grand Council have Power to chuse their Speaker, and shall neither be dissolved, prorogued, nor continue sitting longer than six Weeks at one time, without their own Consent, or the special Command of the Crown.</P>
<P>That the Members of the Grand Council shall be allowed for their Service, <HI>Ten Shillings Sterling per Diem,</HI> during their Session and Journey to and from the Place of Meeting, twenty Miles to be reckoned a Day's Journey.</P>
<P>That the Assent of the President General be requisite to all Acts of the Grand Council; and that it be his Office and Duty to cause them to be carried into Execution.</P>
<P>That the President General, with the Advice of the Grand Council, hold or direct all <HI>Indian</HI> Treaties, in which the general Interest or Welfare of the Colonies may be concerned; and to
<PB N="11" REF="007433_0011_102D860C1CA75B90"/>make Peace or declare War with <HI>Indian</HI> Nations. That they make such Laws as they judge necessary for regulating all <HI>Indian</HI> Trade. That they make all Purchases from <HI>Indians</HI> for the Crown, of the Lands now not within the Bounds of particular Colonies, or that shall not be within their Bounds, when some of them are reduced to more convenient Dimensions. That they make new Settlements on such Purchases, by granting Lands in the King's Name, reserving a Quit-Rent to the Crown for the Use of the General Treasury.</P>
<P>That they make Laws for regulating and governing such new Settlements, 'till the Crown shall think fit to form them into particular Government.</P>
<P>That they may raise and pay Soldiers, and build Forts for the Defence of any of the Colonies, and equip Vessels of force to guard the Coast, and protect the Trade on the Ocean, Lakes, or great Rivers; but they shall not impress Men in any Colony, without the Consent of its Legislature.</P>
<P>That for those Purposes, they have Power to make Laws, and lay and levy such general Duties, Imposts, or Taxes, as to themselves appear most equal and just, considering the Ability and other Circumstances of the Inhabitants in the several Colo∣nies, and such as may be collected with the least Inconvenience to the People; rather discouraging Luxury, than loading Industry with unnecessary Burthens.</P>
<P>That they may appoint a general Treasurer and a particular Treasurer in each Government, when necessary; and from time to time, may order the Sums in the Treasuries of each Govern∣ment, into the General Treasury, or draw on them for special Payments, as they find most convenient; yet no Money to issue, but by joint Orders of the President General and Grand Council, except where Sums have been appropriated to particular Pur∣poses, and the President General is previously impowered by an Act, to draw for such Sums.</P>

<P>That the Laws made by them for the Purposes aforesaid, shall not be repugnant, but as near as may be agreable, to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and shall be transmitted to the King in Council, for Approbation, as soon as may be, after their passing; and if not disapproved within three Years after Presentation, to remain in Force.</P>
<P>That in Case of the Death of the President General, the Speaker of the Grand Council for the Time being, shall succeed, and be vested with the same Power and Authorities, and continue 'till the King's Pleasure be known.</P>
<P>That all Military Commission Officers, whether for Land or Sea Service, to act under this General Constitution, be nominated
<PB N="12" REF="007433_0012_102D860E21AA35B8"/>by the President General, but the Approbation of the Grand Council is to be obtained, before they receive their Commissions. And all Civil Officers are to be nominated by the Grand Coun∣cil, and to receive the President General's Approbation, before they officiate. But in Case of Vacancy, by Death or Removal of any Officer, Civil or Military, under this Constitution, the Governor of the Provinces in which such Vacancy happens, may appoint, 'till the Pleasure of the President General and Grand Council can be known.</P>
<P>That the particular Military as well as Civil Establishments in each Colony, remain in their present State, this General Consti∣tution notwithstanding; and that of sudden Emergencies, any Colony may defend itself, and lay the Accounts of Expence thence arisen, before the President General and Grand Council, who may allow and order Payment of the same, as far as they judge such Accounts just and reasonable.</P>
<P><HI>After</HI> DEBATE <HI>on the foregoing PLAN:</HI></P>
<P><HI>RESOLVED,</HI> That the Cmmissioners from the several Go∣vernments, be desired to lay the same before their respective Constituents, for their Consideration; and that the Secretary to this Board, transmit a Copy thereof, with this Vote thereon, to the Governor of each of the Colonies, which have not sent their Commissioners to this Congress.</P>
<P>ORDERED, That all His Majesty's Governments on this Con∣tinent, may have Liberty from time to time, to take Copies of the Proceedings of this Congress, or any Parts thereof, paying for the same; and that no other Copies be delivered by the Secretary.</P>

<P>THUS having seen Abstracts of the Authorities given the Commissioners who were at <HI>Albany,</HI> and of those Letters from the Crown, which occasioned such Authorities to be given; together with the State of the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and the proposed Plan of Union, formed in Consequence of the whole: From and impartial View thereof, let every Man judge, Whether it was not the Intent of all the Colonies who sent Commissioners, that they should form some <HI>General Scheme</HI> or <HI>Plan,</HI> for the Safety and Defence of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, and the <HI>Indians</HI> in their Alliance? Look into the Commission from Governor <HI>Greene:</HI> and after full Powers are given to do every Thing relative to the <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with us, What mean these following Words? <Q>And also, <HI>what else may be necessary</HI> to prohibit the <HI>French,</HI> and their Allies the <HI>Indians,</HI> from encroaching on the Lands within the Dominions of His Majesty. And in general, as far as the Abilities of this Government will permit, <HI>to act in Conjunction</HI> with the said Commissioners, in every Thing ne∣cessary for the Good of His Majesty's Subjects in these Parts. And to answer as far as we can, the Designs of His Majesty's Instructions to this Colony, communicated to us by the Earl of <HI>Holdernesse.</HI></Q> Surely such Words as these, have some Meaning;
<PB N="13" REF="007433_0013_102D8610519E8F20"/>and if the Commissoners were so unhappy as quite to mistake their Meaning, let those penetrating Wits who think so, shew to the World, how they are to be understood. But if those Authorities were too extensive, let them be blamed who gave such Authori∣ties, and not those who executed them in the most sparing Man∣ner possible. And will any Man believe, such exact Likeness in Substance, should be in the Authorities given by every Govern∣ment to their Commissioners, without having any Conference together about it, if the Directions from the Crown had not pointed it out to them in so plain a Manner, that they all understood them alike? And is it not as plain, from the Letters since received from the Secretaries of State, that they all understood them in the Sense the King intended them?</P>
<P>Altho' all this were allowed, yet some may say, If you had Powers given you to enter into some such General Scheme, you ought not to have consented to one so hurtful and destructive of our Liberties as this is! Whether the Plan formed at <HI>Albany,</HI> be a good one, or a bad one, I shall not undertake to determin; yet let it be considered, that the <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Commissioners were but two of the whole Number, and therefore were far from being able to govern or form Things as they might think best; neither did they ever pretend they could not be mistaken; and Errors of Judgment will always be forgiven by Men of Candor.</P>
<P>And now let us examin what the Commissioners did relating to this Plan, and we shall find, they did no more than form it, and agree to lay it before the General Assemblies of the Colonies from whence they came, for their Consideration. They did not, as is falsly asserted, order it to be sent Home. They did not establish it as an Act or Ordinance of the Board of Commissioners, as they all might have done, by the Authorities given them. They did not leave it in the Power of any one to obtain a Copy of it, and send it Home; but strictly forbid their Secretary to give any Copy, except to the Colonies. Nor did they ever agree to any Thing more, than to carry it to their respective Governments, and lay it before their Constituents. And agreable to the Resolve of the Board of Commissioners, those from <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> did lay this Plan, with all other their Proceedings at <HI>Albany,</HI> before the Ge∣neral Assembly, at their Session in <HI>August</HI> last, for their Consider∣ation. Was this criminal! Was this betraying their Trust! Or was there any Thing more in this, than their Duty! Even Envy and Ignorance joined together, cannot say there was! And those who have been bold enough to Assert, That any Thing more relating to this Plan of Union was done, suffered to be done, or connived at, by the Commissioners, are hereby publicly called upon, to prove their Assertions, or confess their Falshood.</P>
<P>Once more, let us hold up this so much talked of, <HI>Plan of Union,</HI> and view it in another Light: And here, to do my Ad∣versaries all the Justice they can possibly desire, I will, for Argu∣ment-sake, confess it to be as bad as they represent it to be. Viewing it in this Light, it must be sound contrary to, and sub∣versive of our happy Constitution, and all those valuable Privileges
<PB N="14" REF="007433_0014_102DAE9F54787A80" MS="y"/>we enjoy under it. This destructive Plan was laid before the General Assembly, for their Consideration, in the Month of <HI>August</HI> last: This gave an Opportunity to those Patriots belonging to the Council, who now say so much against this Plan, to have exerted themselves in Defence of our Liberties, so much in Dan∣ger, and prevented the dismal Effects so much seared. Well! What have these Champions for Liberty, done in this Matter? Have they not let it lie before the Assembly between six and seven Months, without taking it once under Consideration? Or, Have they ever rejected it? or so much as once in all this Time, moved to have one Word wrote Home, to prevent its taking Place? Was it bad, as they say 'tis, then certainly 'twas their Duty to have done all in their Power to prevent its taking Effect. All Men must confess, the Plan was either good or bad; if 'twas good, Why do they blame it? if 'twas bad, Why have they done Nothing about it?</P>
<P>Now, let every sober-minded Man determin, Whether these Men can be real Friends to the Colony, who placed in the fore∣most Offices, and intrusted with its Safety, could let a Thing so dangerous to its Interest, lie unobserved by the General Assembly, near seven Months, 'till perhaps it may be too late to prevent it? And then to serve a private Party Turn, suddenly to roar out, <HI>The Colony is in Danger!</HI> All who have Eyes, will see thro' such thin Disguses, and be assured, that the Designs of these Men, are only to blast the Reputation of one of the <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Com∣missioners, who at present may seem to stand in their Way; and not to do the Colony any Service; for if that had been the Case, they would have told us these Things sooner.</P>
<P>What could the Commissioners for <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> have done more? or what could they have done less than they did, relative to this Plan? It was not in their Power to procure a better; and whe∣ther it was good or bad, it was equally their Duty to lay it be∣fore the Assembly who sent them: They did so, and did no more; and every Member of both Houses of Assembly can bear Witness, I have never used the least Endeavour to induce them to accede to it. If it is bad, as some are pleas'd to represent it, Must not every Man say. They who have suffered it to lie thus long, are the very Men who have betrayed their Trust, and the Interest of the Colony?</P>
<P>Real want of Merit, occasions these Men's Endeavour to rise upon the Ruin of their neighbour's Reputation. But can the Faults of my Neighbour, make me fit for an Office? And can the valuable Privileges of this Colony be safe in those Hands, where every Thing else seems to be neglected, but what will serve their private Purposes? As I am a Candidate for an Office, I sincerely desire all Men may put their Country's Interest in the first Place, and give their Votes only where they think 'tis most safe; and assure themselves, such a Conduct will perfectly please the Colony's, and their Friend,</P>
