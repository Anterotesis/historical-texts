<P>THE Deplorable State OF <HI>New-England,</HI> By Reason of a <HI>Covetous</HI> and <HI>Treacherous GOVERNOUR,</HI> AND <HI>Pusillanimous</HI> COUNSELLORS WITH A VINDICATION of the Honourable <HI>Mr. HIGGINSON,</HI> Mr. <HI>MASON,</HI> and several other Gentlemen, from the Scanda∣lous and Wicked <HI>Accusation</HI> of the VOTES ordered by Them to be Published in their <HI>BOTSON</HI> New Letter.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IF the <HI>New-England Councellors</HI> (as well as their Governour) are publickly expo∣sed in a Land a Thousand Leagues distant from them, they have no reason to com∣plain of bard Dealing, <HI>Lex Talionis</HI> re∣quires that it should be so; for it is nothing but what they themselves have done, by Gentlemen who are on several Accounts superior to them. We wish they may be sensible of the great Hurt their Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is like to suffer by their Means. They have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>uraged their Friends from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appearing aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in their Behalf, when if they should, they, to please their Governour, will in Print, <HI>brand</HI> them for <HI>Scand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lous and Wicked Ac∣cusers.</HI></P>
<P>Their Fault is the more aggravated, in that after they saw an <HI>Invoice</HI> which mentions an Hundred Thousand Nails, sent to the <HI>Queen's</HI> Enemies at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> allowed by the Gover∣nour under his own Hand, they caused their abu∣sive <HI>Vote</HI> to be printed. Only we Hear that their <HI>Secretary,</HI> who is a Prudent Man, and one of their <HI>Counsellours,</HI> was against the Publica∣tion of their Scandalous <HI>Vote.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="002214_0003_0FDACEED52E474D0"/>
But we likewise hear, that some of them moved that several Affidavits, which had been laid before <HI>Her Majesty</HI> in <HI>Council,</HI> and were after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Printed here in <HI>London,</HI> might be burnt, because they Complained of their Governour's Notorious Briberies, and other Male Administrations. Pro∣bably the same Persons will make the like <HI>Propo∣sal</HI> again, if a New Governour does not <HI>Nega∣tive</HI> them out of his <HI>Council,</HI> which we suppose he will, unless the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the <HI>Pro∣vince</HI> (as in Duty they are Bound) shall save him the Trouble.</P>
<P>The Reader may depend upon it, that as to <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> there is nothing in this <HI>Narra∣tive</HI> but Exact <HI>Truth;</HI> what is therein Related, is not only affirmed by Gentlemen worthy of Credit lately come from <HI>Boston,</HI> but by Letters from as Eminent Persons as any in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>The Deplorable</HI> STATE OF New-England.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION. I.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Late <HI>Votes</HI> passed in the General Assem∣bly at <HI>Boston,</HI> and Printed in the <HI>Boston</HI> News-Letter, Cause us to Reflect with some Wonder on the <HI>Deplorable State of the Plantations.</HI></P>
<P>They that are sent over as <HI>Governours</HI> thither, appear as Persons of Suitable <HI>Abilities,</HI> and approved <HI>Loyalty.</HI> They are in Favour with some Ministers of <HI>State,</HI> who Recommend them to the King or Queen for the Time be∣ing; and are in Fee with their <HI>Clarks,</HI> by whose Means their Business is done the more Effectually. When they arrive with their Commissions, they Express themselves in Obliging Terms; and the Ravish'd People, who are quite Giddy with Joy, if they have Governours, which they may hope, will not <HI>Cut their Throats,</HI> make them Noble Presents, and send home an <HI>Address of Thanks</HI> for such Admirable Governours.</P>
<P>Their Next Work is, by all possible Artifices, to get into all <HI>Offices</HI> about the Country, such as are, or they know, will be, meer <HI>Creatures</HI> to them; or at least, su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as are not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnished either with <HI>Courage</HI> or <HI>Conduct.</HI> to make any <HI>Complaints</HI> Home against them, in Case of any Male-Administration.</P>
<P>After this, let the Governour do what he will, either
<PB N="2" REF="002214_0005_0FDACEF05E058430"/>there will be no Body <HI>Strong</HI> enough to Repair unto the Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with due Remonstrances; or if any Body <HI>do,</HI> the <HI>Governour</HI> has many Ways to molest him and his, and to Defeat all his Undertakings. Yea, 'tis Ten Thousand to One, but at the very Time, when an oppressed Person is Solliciting his own, and an oppressed People's Cause, the Governour may have so modell'd the <HI>General Assem∣bly,</HI> that they shall pass wretched <HI>Votes</HI> to his Advantage, and <HI>Kiss the Hand,</HI> which all the open Eyes in the Coun∣try see Stabbing of them.</P>
<P>One would have thought, the People of <HI>N. England</HI> should have been Sensible of their Good Fortune in it; that when they are betrayed in Miserable Circumstances by an Hungry Governour, who has been willing to Enrich himself and his Family, on the Ruines of his Country, some Gentlemen of Note, have interposed with Humble <HI>Addresses</HI> to her Majesty on their Behalf. They have no <HI>Agent</HI> here, but what is entirely in the Interest of their Governour. When the whole House of Representatives sent over hither, an Address to the Queen, relating to matter of the greatest Importance, the <HI>Agent</HI> whom they had I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy'd and Rewarded with some Hundreds of Pounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fused to Present the Address, because it would not suit with the Governour's Interest, and wrote them word, <HI>That no Address. must be presented, except Signed by the Governour.</HI> And yet after this, the same Gentle∣man could present <HI>Adresses</HI> for the continuance of the Governour which were signed by <HI>Private Hands,</HI> and pro∣cured by <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> little to the Honour of those Concerned. Some Gentlemen here, knowing the Opress'd and Betray'd Condition of that poor People, have Ad∣dress'd on their Behalf; and have said nothing in their Address, but what they had the Oaths of several Good Men, to support the Truth of what was Asserted: But, lo! to their Surprize, they find themselves in the <HI>Boston News Letter</HI> Exposed, as having been the Authors of <HI>Seandalous and wicked Accusations!</HI> The <HI>Counsellors</HI> of <HI>N. England,</HI> have done as much as lies in them for ever to discourage all Gentlemen here from appearing for the
<PB N="3" REF="002214_0006_0FDACEF2231BB778"/>Country, let never such Difficult Circumstances be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon it; but we will pity them, as Trapann'd into they <HI>know not what themselves!</HI> However, if they will allow no body here to speak for their <HI>Country,</HI> they can't forbid us to Speak for <HI>Ourselves,</HI> which they have now made but too Necessary for us.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>New-England</HI> Inform us, That the Great and only Reason, why some of the Council there will <HI>strmly Believe</HI> more Charitably of their Governour <HI>Dud∣ley,</HI> than many others do, is, <HI>Because his Family and In∣terest is there, and therefore 'tis unreasonable to Believe, that he would do any thing that should hurt the Country.</HI></P>
<P>But, Was not his <HI>Family and Interest</HI> there in Sir <HI>Ed∣mund Andross</HI>'s time? And yet a Book Published here, by the Agents of <HI>New-England,</HI> after the Revolution, Intituled, <HI>The Revolution in</HI> New-England <HI>Justified,</HI> has given the World a sad Story of what a Colonel <HI>Dudley</HI> may do towards the Ruining a Country which has his <HI>Family and Interests</HI> in it. Read that History and you will find, that after Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> had been an Agent for the Country, he tack'd about, and join'd with the Instru∣ments that overthrew their <HI>Charter,</HI> and accepted an Ille∣gal and Arbitrary Commission from King <HI>James,</HI> by which he held the Government, until the Arrival of Sir <HI>Edmund Andross,</HI> and then was, as <HI>President</HI> of the Council, and <HI>Chief Judge</HI> of the Territory, a <HI>Chief Tool</HI> of all the ensuing barbarous and infamous Administration. They governed without an <HI>Assembly,</HI> when the Laws were proposed in the Council, tho' the <HI>major Part</HI> of the Coun∣cil should happen to dissent, yet if the <HI>Governour</HI> was positive, there was a <HI>President</HI> at the Board, by whose Allowance the Laws were immediately <HI>Engrossed, Pub∣lished,</HI> and <HI>Executed:</HI> And Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> did not contra∣dict it when some of the Principal Gentlemen in the Country were told at the Council Board, <HI>You have no more Privileges left you but this, that you are not Bought and Sold for Slaves.</HI> By the Sequel we shall see not this neither. A <HI>Juncto,</HI> (wherein how often this Chief Judge, was of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> is now forgotten) made a
<PB N="4" REF="002214_0007_0FDACEF355F41248"/>World of Laws, which Pillaged that poor People Despe∣rately. They Levied a Tax on the whole People with∣out any Assembly; and when the Principal Persons, and some others in <HI>Ips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> on that Occasion, with all possible Modesty moved, that the King should be Humbly Petiti∣on'd for the Liberty of an Assembly, they were Commit∣ted to Prison for an <HI>High Misdemeanour,</HI> and were Denied an <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> &amp; Drag'd many Miles out of their own County to Answer it at a Court in <HI>Boston,</HI> where <HI>Jurors</HI> were pickt for the Turn, that were neither <HI>Free-holders,</HI> nor so much as <HI>Inhabitants.</HI> They were all Fined severe∣ly, and laid under great Bonds for their <HI>Good Behaviour;</HI> besides which, the Hungry Officers Extorted Fees of near Two Hundred Pounds, where they would not have risen to Ten Pounds, had any Law of <HI>England,</HI> or Justice been Observed. The Townsmen of many other Places were served in the like Fashion; and our Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> was a Principal Actor in all this Wickedness. It was now denyed that any Man was owner of a Foot of Land in all the Colony. Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> gave it as his Judgment un∣der his Hand. <HI>Writs of Intrusion</HI> were presently served upon the Chief Gentlemen in the Country, to Compel them, and others by the Terror of their Example, to take <HI>Patents</HI> for the Lands which they had quietly possessed for Fifty or Sixty Years together. For these <HI>Patents</HI> there were such Exorbitant Prices demanded, that Fifty Pounds would not purchase for its owner, an Estate not worth Two Hundred; nor could all the Money and Moveables in the Territory, have defrayed the Charges of Pattenting the Lands.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Harpies</HI> were at any Time a little out of Money, they Invented Pretences to Imprison the Best Men in the Country, and tho' there Appeared not the least Informa∣tion of any Crime against them, yet they were put unto intollerable Expences, and the Benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was denied unto them. Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> knows this, and we suppose he has not forgotten either Colo∣nell <HI>Saltonstal,</HI> or Major <HI>Appleton.</HI> Pickt <HI>Juries</HI> were commonly used, for the Trouble of Honest and Worthy
<PB N="5" REF="002214_0008_0FDACEF4D2E3B180"/>Men, and they were hurried out of their own Counties to be tryed, where Juries for their Turn were not likely to be found there. Judge <HI>Dudley</HI> knows this; and we suppose he remembers the famous Mr. <HI>Morton.</HI></P>
<P>In short, all things were going to Wreck, but yet Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> was like to enrich himself and his Family in the general Ship-wreck. There lies the Mystery!</P>
<P>These things, and many more such things, are asserted in the Book aforesaid, not only by the Oaths of many honest Gentlemen, but also by a Declaratian Signed by the Honourable Hands of Judge <HI>Stoughton,</HI> and Major General <HI>Winthrop,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Shrimpton,</HI> and other Members of the Council.</P>
<P>The World has heard how narrowly Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> escaped a <HI>De-Witting</HI> for these his Follies, from the inraged Peo∣ple in the <HI>Revolution.</HI> Being then sent over a Prisouer to <HI>England,</HI> he with the rest, were here set at Liberty. He returned, with a Commission for the Place of <HI>Chief Judge</HI> in the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> where his first Work, after his Arrival was, to Condemn to Death, the Lieu∣tenant Governour of the Province, and another Gentle∣man, for not surrendring the Government before Governour <HI>Slaughter</HI> arriv'd with his Commission. The Condemnation and Execution of these two Gentlemen, was a Bloody Business: It was afterwards Examined in Parliament, where Colonel <HI>Dudley</HI> underwent a Confusion which will never be worn off; and Mr. <HI>Constantine Phips,</HI> Pro∣secuted the Matter with so much Demonstration, that Eminent Persons in both Houses, declared it, <HI>A Barbarous Murder;</HI> King, Lords, and Commons, did as good as de∣clare it so, and by an <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> Revoked the <HI>Attainder</HI> of the Murdered Gentlemen. On this Occa∣sion, Judge <HI>Stoughton,</HI> (who was yet always known to be as Partial to Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> and his Interest, as any Man in <HI>New England</HI>) said to some of his Friends, what he had formerly been heard to say unto others, <HI>Alas, to get a little Money, he would make his own Father hold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p his hand at the Bar.</HI> There, Gentlemen, you have again the <HI>Key</HI> to explain the Matter; which because you
<PB N="6" REF="002214_0009_0FDACEF65385BDE0"/>cant see thro', you <HI>Firmly Believe</HI> as you do!</P>
<P>After many Years Absence from his Family, my Lord <HI>Bellamont,</HI> the Governour of <HI>New England</HI> Dies. Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> by many fair Promises, both to Gentlemen here, and at his own Home, obtains Recommendations for a Succession in the Government. He had not been long in the Government, before the following MEMORIAL was sent over to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="memorial">
<HEAD><HI>A MEMORIAL</HI> On the Behalf of the Province of the <HI>Massachu∣sett</HI>'s Bay, in <HI>NEW-ENGLAND;</HI> Relating to the Administration of their pre∣sent Governour, Collonel <HI>Dudley.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. ONE Principal Grievance, which Comprehends many under it, is, The Course of <HI>Bribery,</HI> which runs thro' the Governours Administration, whereby the Queen's Government is greatly Exposed in a Country where <HI>Bribery</HI> has rarely, if ever before this, been known to be Practised. The Governour having brought in his Son to be Attorney General, this Corruption is the more effectually carried on between them, unto the great Oppression of the People.</P>
<P>Only two Instances, among many, shall be reported in this Memorial.</P>
<P N="1">1. Certain People having purchased Land at a New Plantation called <HI>Nashoba,</HI> and wanting a Confirmation of their Title, by an Act of the General Assembly, as is Usual in such Cases) they could not have the Go∣vernour's Assent unto the Act, without a <HI>Bribe</HI> of a Thousand Acres of the best Land, and in the Center of the Plantation, and to the Ruin of the rest.</P>
<P N="2">2. Also, a Tract of Land at <HI>Nipmuck,</HI> belonging to
<PB N="7" REF="002214_0010_0FDACEF7D2CEF4E8"/>Nine or Ten Partners, when both Houses in the General Assembly had passed the <HI>Bill,</HI> to Allow their Title, (as was Requisite by an Old Law of the Country) the Go∣vernour would not Sign the Act, until he had a Bribe of Twenty Pounds, and one whole Share of the Land, which was valued at One Hundred and Fifty Pounds more.</P>
<P>But, if a <HI>Commission of Enquiry</HI> could be Obtained, there would be such Practices of this Nature Discovered as are hardly to be P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrallel'd.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Governour, meerly to gratify his own Arbi∣trary Will and Pleasure did for some while Refuse to fill up the necessary Number of Judges; by which Means, the <HI>Courts</HI> dropt, and the <HI>Course of Justice</HI> was Obstructed; and the oppressed People were Defeated in their Suits, to the Damage of many Hundreds of Pounds.</P>
<P N="3">III. There have been odd <HI>Collusions</HI> with the Pirates of <HI>Quelch's</HI> Company, of which one Instance is, That there was extorted the Sum of about Thirty Pounds from some of the Crue, for Liberty to walk at certain times in the Prison Yard; and this Liberty having been allow'd for Two or Three Days unto them, they were again confined to their former wretched Circumstances.</P>
<P N="4">IV. An Army of Volunteers went out, and did Good Service upon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy at <HI>Acady.</HI> They were encouraged by an Act of the Governour and General Assembly, which promised the Soldiers a cer∣tain Share of the Plunder. When the Soldiers returned, some Officers, without their Consent or Knowledge, and before the Division of the Plunder, made the Governour a considerable Present out of it; whereupon he so managed the Matter with the said Officers, as to cheat and cut on the Soldiers of near one Half that the Act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Assem∣bly had promised them! When the House of Repre∣sentatives applied themselves to the Governour on this Occasion, they could get nothing from him. <HI>By this means, no more Volunteers are like to appear in her Majesty's Service.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002214_0011_0FDACEF95A480AE8"/>
The Governour's manner is, to trample on the Assembly with gross Indignities; and such as they have never received from former Governours. Nor can they have any Redress of Grievances, tho' many have been from time to time represented.</P>
<P>And when Bills for the Payment of the just Debts of the Province, are presented to him to be signed, he has declared, he would not sign them, except he were himself gratified with Sums demanded of them.</P>
<P>On these, and many more such Accounts, it is humbly conceived that it would be much for her Majesty's In terest, if a more acceptable Governour were placed over that Province.</P>
</DIV1>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>This was the <HI>Memorial,</HI> but because there was no Body to prosecute it, it fell to the Ground.</P>
<P>Much about the same time, there came to Light a little more of Col. <HI>Dudley</HI>'s Designs upon the <HI>New Charter</HI> of the Province. It seems, he was as willing to do the same Kindness for this, that he did for the <HI>Old One;</HI> and that he was at this very time doing for the Colony of <HI>Connecticut;</HI> which, if it were accomplished, would lay the Country open to an Innundation of Ca∣lamities. His Son <HI>Paul,</HI> (the great Instrument of his Oppressions) writes over to his Friend in <HI>London,</HI> a Letter, wherein are these following Words.</P>

<P>BY Letters from <HI>New-England,</HI> we are informed how Matters past in the last Sessions of their General Assembly, which was in <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November</HI> 1707. One would have imagined, that the <HI>Mast-Fleet,</HI> which brings us our Letters of Intelligence, had been the <HI>Gousolidager,</HI> coming back with Intelligence from the <HI>World in the Moon:</HI> For such things could never have happen'd but among a People very <HI>Lunatick</HI> — And.
<PB N="10" REF="002214_0013_0FDACEFC52F4FF30"/>First let us begin, as in good Manners bound, with the <HI>Upper House.</HI></P>
<P>Their Governour <HI>Dudley,</HI> produced to the Council, the Copy of an Address to the Queen's Majesty, signed by above Twenty Gentlemen in <HI>London,</HI> in which, out of the Respect to a Country for which they were more generously concerned, than some that were under greater Obligations, they Petitioned for <HI>Dudley's</HI> Removal from his Government; alledging, among other weighty Reasons, <HI>That he had Countenanc'd a private Trade &amp; Correspondence with Her Majesty's Enemies, the</HI> French, <HI>and the</HI> Indians <HI>which are in their Interests.</HI> He required his Counsellors <HI>immediately</HI> to clear him from these Imputations. He came upon them with his Demand, on the <HI>Saturday</HI> next, when they were, (as they usually then are) in the Hurry of breaking up. 'Tis the time when the Governour commonly makes any thing to pass, that either House must be either <HI>Trick'd</HI> or <HI>Tir'd</HI> into. Three or Four of the Council, particularly <HI>Brown, Sewall,</HI> and <HI>Pain,</HI> pray'd, That since the thing was both New and Weighty, it might be put off till <HI>Monday.</HI> The Governour, with a boisterous Fury required them to do it <HI>immediately;</HI> and they did it <HI>immediately:</HI> At once they rushed into a <HI>Vote,</HI> wherein they say,</P>

<P>The Council being Brow-beaten into such a Vote, one of that Board, namely, Mr. <HI>Samuel Sewall,</HI> who is also a <HI>Judge</HI> of the Superiour Court; but a Person of unspotted Integrity, thought himself bound in Conscience to exhi∣bit a Remonstrance against this Rash Vote: His Relation
<PB N="11" REF="002214_0014_0FDACEFDD76B73F0"/>as a Brother in Law to the Governour, did not get the Upper-hand of his Conscience; but he Presented his Remonstrance to the Board, and had it enter'd on <HI>File;</HI> from whence one of our Correspondents has obiained a Copy. 'Tis as follows.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>THE Reasons of my withdrawing my Vote, from what was Passed in Council upon <HI>Saturday, Nov.</HI> the first, relating to an <HI>Address</HI> offer'd to her Majesty, Sign'd, <HI>Nath. Higginson,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">I. Because my Motion, for leaving the Consideration of it till the <HI>Monday</HI> following, was not admitted; and it was enter'd upon, and pass'd about Noon, in a very short time; being a Matter of great Concernment to our Liege Lady, Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> to the Province, to his Excellency our Governour, and to the Council and Representatives.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Governour's <HI>Personal Interest</HI> was much in it, and therefore I humbly conceive, the Vote ought to have been Debated and Framed by the Members of the Council apart by themselves, in the Absence of the Governour.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Words [<HI>firmly Believe,</HI>] and [<HI>always Ap∣parent,</HI>] were never pleasing to me. And <HI>now,</HI> I do not <HI>firmly Believe,</HI> that the Governour did no way allow Mr. <HI>Borland,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Vetch,</HI> their Trading Voyage to Her Majesty's Enemies the <HI>French.</HI></P>

<P>IV. I have been Acquainted with Mr. <HI>Nathanael Higginson</HI> these Fourty Years; and I cannot judge, the offering this Address to Her Majesty, to be in him a <HI>Scandalous and Wicked Accusation,</HI> unless I know his Inducements.

</LETTER>
<P>Tho' this Gentleman has thus recalled his Vote, (and another Gentleman present in the Council, never had a Vote put to him) and he insisted on it, as we are informed, that it would be a <HI>Direct Falsehood in Matter of Fact.</HI> Now to call this <HI>an Unanimous Vote,</HI> yet we find it was after this ordered to be printed in the <HI>Boston News Letter,</HI> with a PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. We cannot conceive how the Council could order a Direct Falsehood to be Printed, if their Souls were their own. Or, if they would so misrepresent Judge <HI>Sewall</HI> and Col. <HI>Higginson,</HI> (Brother to Mr. <HI>Nathanael Higgin∣son</HI>) it may be they did also misrepresent themselves, in saying, <HI>they firmly Believe,</HI> when it is strange if they do <HI>really Believe</HI> it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002214_0016_0FDACF00D3863310"/>
Notwithstanding their News-Letter says, their Vote was passed <HI>Unanimously,</HI> Worthy Gentlemen in <HI>New Eng∣land</HI> have given us such a Character of their <HI>Winthrop,</HI> their <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> their <HI>Foster,</HI> and some others of them, as that we cannot <HI>Firmly Believe,</HI> that they ever consented to have the Hon Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> so stigmatized in the <HI>Boston</HI> Infamous News Letter. Nor is it to be imagined that they are all so <HI>Parado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical,</HI> as we hear some of them are; for you cannot with a Beetle beat it into some of them, but that if a Vote obtain a <HI>Majority,</HI> it is to be called an <HI>Unanimous Vote.</HI> We have been told, and we thought so by hearing those talk who came from thence) that they Speak as good <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Boston,</HI> as they do in <HI>London:</HI> But we perceive, in the <HI>Council Chamber</HI> there, they begin to forget the <HI>English Tongue,</HI> and they have lost the Sense of the Word <HI>Unanimous.</HI></P>
<P>One may guess at the Politick Reason, which drew too many of them into that undeliberate, inconfiderate Vote aforesaid; by what one of them (a principal Stick∣ler for <HI>Majority</HI> being <HI>Unanimity</HI>) utter'd in a Barber's Shop, with so much Openness, that the Noise of it has reach'd over hither to <HI>London,</HI> That it was best for us, <HI>to keep this Governour, (tho' he had done very Bad things) for he had sufficiently spunged upon the People, and had now got Money enough; he was now satisfyed.</HI> [No, Sir, by your Leave, 'tis the Thirst of a Dropsy!] <HI>And had pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately promis'd the Council, he would do so no more. Where∣as, if another Governour come, he will come hungry, and we must be squeezed over again.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Gentlemen of the Council caused their Vote to run in some softer Terms; as, That they were sorry such Eminent Persons, as Mr. <HI>Higginson;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ma∣son,</HI> &amp;c. had been imposed upon by such Informations, as produced their <HI>Address</HI> to Her Majesty. This had been somewhat like <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> tho' not like <HI>Councellers:</HI> For some of them own, they had never seen any of the <HI>Affidavits</HI> made before the Queen and Council, nor any of those other things a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to be produced, when they passed their Hasty Vote. But for them now to run upon these
<PB N="14" REF="002214_0017_0FDACF0252973F30"/>Eminent Persons, with a Clamour of <HI>Scandalous and Wicked Accusations;</HI> yea, Publickly to Stigmatize them in their Infamous News Letter, as being <HI>Scandalous and Wicked Accusers!</HI> Truly therein they have not Honoured themselves. The <HI>Higginson</HI> they vilify, is a Person every way much Superior to the Best of them: The Ho∣nour and Figure he has obtained by his good Conduct in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> will not be impaired by any Affronts from the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> The <HI>Mason</HI> whom they throw Dirt upon, was a Member of their Council, before a great part of them were so; and served their Agents with no small Assistances.</P>
<P>'Tis unintelligible! Why will the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Coun∣sellors permit themselves to be made the Tools of their Governour's particular Desigus? Why will Councellors that are chosen by the People, be less concerned for, less faithful to the People, than the Counsellors in the other Plantations, who are not by the Choice of the People brought unto the Board; where yet we see, they often prove Thorns in the Sides of Evil Governours? Will you give your Friends at a Thousand Leagues distance from you, leave to advise you? We make no doubt, there are wise and good Men at your Board. We make no doubt, you are often over-voted by some of your Brethren, coming from your Country Towns, who are not over∣stockt with more than One of those Qualities. But where is your Courage? In Truth, 'tis ths least of your Talents; you must get a little more of it. You should be ready to say before the Governour's Face, what you talk so freely behind his Back, that the Report of it reaches over the <HI>Atlantick.</HI></P>
<P>You know, That when the Governour will have any thing pass among you, all your humble Intreaties to have a few Hours Time to think upon it, signify nothing; he will have it go <HI>Just Now,</HI> and you <HI>let it go.</HI> So you are ever now and then push'd into you know not what your selves, and you durst not Lisp your Dissatis∣faction. You know, that when Officers are to be Elected, the Governour must issue out a Notification for a <HI>Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ral Council,</HI> to come together at the Day; but <HI>on</HI> the
<PB N="15" REF="002214_0018_0FDACF03D5F70818"/>Day the thing is rarely done; 'tis put off two or three Days till you are dispersed, and a <HI>Nick of Time</HI> is taken, in which Elections are carried on, which we hear, much disoblige the Publick; and Justices are created which have brought the Queen's Commissions under such Dis∣paragement, that we hear many of the best Gentlemen among you, scorn to accept of them.</P>
<P>You know that things are managed with Tricks. Frauds and Juggles, without Numbers; and yet, you durst not Open your Mouths. You cannot but know, That your Governour ever now and then, will violently assert a thing, and you assent to it: Anon, in the very same Sessions of the Court, he will as violently assert a thing Diametrically Opposite unto it, (as the Service of some ill Cause may drive him to) and you durst not say, that you don't Assent to <HI>that</HI> also.</P>
<P>We understand that your former Governour, the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Bellamont,</HI> did not use to Treat you so; and was it for this, that you offered such an Indignity unto that Noble Person, as to vote, <HI>The Taking off his Speech from the File,</HI> as soon as Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udley</HI> (being one of <HI>Tory</HI> Principles, which my Lord was not) at his first coming moved you to it, and made you the Tools of his Malice against the Earl of <HI>Bellamont,</HI> for sticking so close to him in the Parliament, upon the <HI>BARBAROUS MURDER</HI> (as he would always call it) of <HI>Leister</HI> and <HI>Milburn?</HI> Your Governour with a Torrent of Language, and Mix∣ture of <HI>Coaksing</HI> and <HI>Bouncing,</HI> and Coundent Assertions of Things (True or False, 'tis all one, yon can't Disprove them) has been <HI>too many</HI> for you. We advise you to Unite more together, a sufficient Number of you, and present strong Remonstrances on such Occasions, if the Successor (which we are satisfied he will not,) should go on in the late Methods. And we advise you, That you would not be so monstrously afraid of the Governour's putting his <HI>Negative</HI> upon you, the last <HI>Wednesday</HI> of <HI>May.</HI> Should you be Negativ'd out of the Council, for your Fidelity to your Country, it would be a much greater Honour to you than to be there, and no great
<PB N="16" REF="002214_0019_0FDACF05540C5EB8"/>Honour to them that are left behind: But you are already chosen, and sworn to serve till others are chosen; if the Representatives are not satisfyed in the Reasons of the Governour's Negative, they will declare, That they will not proceed unto another Choice. We would beg their Pardon, that they presume to give them this Advice. Then do you pluck up your Spirits: Nothing but an Act of the Assembly can remove a chosen Counsellor. You may appear, and assert your Seat at the Council Board. And you may do it with such apparent Eviden∣ces of being acted by nothing but a Zeal for the Publick, that you may do it without any Dishonourable Charge of being Immodest, or Intruders. Without consulting the Stars, we can foretell to ye, That if you resolve to keep always in the obsequious Strain, you'll at last rowse the Representatives both to remove several of you, and to dispute several Powers which you pretend unto; and especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that of being able to <HI>Sit by your selves</HI> in the Time of the General Assembly; and by your Vote (with∣out the Governour's) to hamper the People with a Third Negative, (besides the Queen's and the Gover∣nour's) which your Agent here says, <HI>Your Charter never intended for you.</HI></P>

<P>WE have seen how the <HI>Blanching</HI> Business went on in the <HI>Council;</HI> Shall we now see how it Pro∣ceeded among the Representatives? We have been told a very odd thing, That the Counsellors will sometimes <HI>Outwardly</HI> Comply with a V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which they <HI>Inwardly</HI> approve not, in hopes that it will never be Carried in the Lower House. But, if this were an Honest, yet it is no Prudent Experiment: There is more than a <HI>little</HI> Danger in it. The Story of the Upper House, has the Truth of it enough confirm'd by Judge <HI>Sewall</HI>'s Instru∣ment of Revocation, if we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had the more Ample
<PB N="17" REF="002214_0020_0FDAC8D913CB42C0"/>Relation, both from Packets and Passengers newly arrived here. For the Story of the Lower House, we have it with a Confirmation (if it be possible) more Authen∣tick. For here are come over Letters from a great Part of the House, unto that Honourable Friend of <HI>New-England,</HI> and of all Good Men, Sir <HI>Henry Asbhurst;</HI> one signed by Seven, and afterwards another signed by about Thrice that Number; both to the same Effect. By these we understand how Notoriously the World is imposed upon.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November</HI> the Plot begun to operate. A Message was brought by sundry <HI>Counsellors,</HI> from their Board, to incite the House, that they would con∣cur with <HI>Their Vote</HI> for the Governour's Vindication. But the House for diverse Days declined to meddle with it; and then the like Message was brought again to the House, by a greater Number of <HI>Counsellors.</HI> The House being thus at length drawn in, to consider this Dirty Matter, there appeared Mr. <HI>John Nelson,</HI> who having sent unto <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> one Hogshe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of Dry Goods, a Parcel of <HI>Iron Pots</HI> and <HI>Scythes,</HI> &amp;c. by a Flag of Truce, whereof Capt. <HI>Rouse</HI> was Commander, now declared. That he had the Governour's Allowance for it, and Capt. <HI>Rouse</HI> being examined, made the same Declara∣tion.</P>
<P>But this was a Trifle to the next: The Gentlemen aforesaid, we believe had no Traiterous Design of sup∣plying the Queen's Enemies. But, when the Fort at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> had no dry Lodgings for the Soldiers; nothing but few Thatch'd things, that also rendered it more combustible to the Fire of the Besiegers; Now, to sup∣ply the <HI>Fort</HI> with Nails to Shingle and Board their <HI>Barecks!</HI> There appeared Mr <HI>Samuel Baker,</HI> who pro∣duced unto the House the Original Invoice, of things which he Ship'd for the Governour and the Commissary at <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> with an Allowance for them, under Governour <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dley's</HI> own Hand.

<P>These things were Ship'd on Board a <HI>French</HI> Vessel, called, <HI>A Flag of Truce (Anglice,</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI>) Capt. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chafeau</HI> Commander. It was done at the very time, when the Governour and Assembly, were Fining <HI>Vetck</HI> and Company, for a Trade as little Criminal; and when an Act of the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Province had made it <HI>Capital.</HI> Some of the Council would feign have perswaded the House, that there was a <HI>Cypher</HI> (their own <HI>Name-sake</HI> In the <HI>Council,</HI>) added unto the 8, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2, of the Nails. But <HI>Baker's</HI> Confession had spoilt that idle Whim. The Governour's Friends, his Majors, Captains, Justices, and Feather-Caps in the House, and the <HI>meaner Slaves of the Trencher,</HI> used all imaginable Artifices to Vindicate him: And yet, when it came to a Vote on <HI>November</HI> the Ninteenth, <HI>Whether, after strict Enquiry, the House could clear his Excellency of Managing, or Countenancing a Private Trade with the</HI> French <HI>and</HI> In∣dian <HI>Enemies,</HI> The Vote passed in the Negative, with a very great Majority. About Forty Five Members, more than Two to One, Voted, That they could not clear him. He had, according to the New <HI>Massachuset</HI> Sense of the Word, <HI>An Unanimous Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>On the Day following, there was a long Conference of Two Hours, held between the Two House, and chiests manag'd by the Governour. At this Conference there occur'd several pretty little Things, which might be
<PB N="19" REF="002214_0022_0FDACF09D5A6E478"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at the Coffee-House, but se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e worthy to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a more a more serious Narrative. We'll menti∣on only two of them,</P>
<P>A Counsellor who had been a mighty decrier of the Governour while he was under his Negative, upon his Re-admission, becomes an Espouser of his Interest. This Gentleman greatly Exposed himself, by saying to the Assembly, <HI>There is no Trade but there is some Returns: I pray, What Return were there? How can you say, this was a Trade carried on?</HI> This became a <HI>By-word</HI> in the Town. They say, the Merchants of <HI>Boston</HI> often to their Sorrow, <HI>Trade without Returns:</HI> And we could wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, that every body here in <HI>London,</HI> who has Traded for <HI>Boston,</HI> could say, <HI>There had always been Returns.</HI></P>
<P>Again, The Governour in his Flourishes, tells the Assembly, <HI>To support the Queens Enemies with an Unlaw∣ful Trade, is to fond them your Beef and your Pork, and not such things as are in this Invoyce.</HI> An Unlucky Old Man in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (they say from a Town call'd <HI>Woburn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Reply'd, <HI>'Tis very True, an't like your Excellency, and your</HI> Butter, <HI>and your</HI> May-krill!—Which gave such a Sting, That the Assembly saw, that if he be an <HI>Happy Man who catches a</HI> Mackrel, yet an <HI>Unhappy Man may be catched with a Mackrel.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day after this Conference, and after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Go∣vernour's Violent Protestations of his own <HI>Innocence,</HI> (as the Letters of the Representatives assure us) the following Vote was again Press'd upon the House, <HI>That we firmly Believe, and are of Opinion, that the Allegations in the Address</HI> (to which the Council referr'd) <HI>of the Governour's Trading, or allowing a Trade with Her Majesty</HI>'s <HI>Enemies the</HI> French, <HI>and the</HI> Indians <HI>in their Interests, it a Scandalous and Wicked Accusation.</HI> Still the Vore passed as formerly, in the <HI>Negative.</HI> The Squeamish Represen∣tatives, it seems, had not such Stomachs of <HI>Ostriches,</HI> as to Digest an <HI>Hundred Thousand Iron Nails</HI> at once; not would they Believe (no, tho' Counsellors told them so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) that <HI>Nails</HI> were not Iron, The Governour's Friends were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at their Wit's Ends;—And in Humble wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="20" REF="002214_0023_0FDACF0B6C4D7DE0"/>besought the House, That they would confine their Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> unto the Particular Trade of <HI>Vetch, Borland</HI> and <HI>Law∣son.</HI> And it was urged, that <HI>Borland</HI> and <HI>Lawson</HI> had cleared the Governour; (the Sham of the <HI>Grateful</HI> Merchants you shall hear anon.) Hereupon the Flexible Honest Men, perfectly Worried, and Wearied our of their Lives, by Three Weeks Alterations, did so many go over, as to make a sort of a Vote of it. But the Conclusion of their Letters to Sir <HI>Henry Ashburst,</HI> (a Gentleman whom <HI>New England</HI> can never sufficiently Requite) is, <HI>Your self, and all Persons may Judge; how far the Vote of this House doth extend to the Vindicating his Excellency from being a Countenancer of Trade with the Queen's Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>We have already intimated, how the Governour comes to have so many Friends in the House; that are so set upon doing him Justice, right or wrong. Besides the Caresses of the Table, which are enough to dazzle an Honest Countryman, who thinks every Body Means what he Speaks; the Influence which Preferments and Commissions have upon little Men, is innexpressible. It must needs be a Mortal Sin, to disoblidge a Governour, that has enabled a Man to command a <HI>whole Country Town,</HI> and to strut among his Neighbours, with the Illustrious Titles of, <HI>Our Major,</HI> and <HI>The Captain,</HI> or <HI>His Worship.</HI> Such magnificent Grandeurs make many to stagger Egre∣giously! If it be but proposed in the Assembly, that any Mismanagements of the Governour be Enquired into, we are informed, that some of those Officers have been so insolent, as to move, <HI>That he who made the Proposal should be set in the Pillory.</HI> We perceive, the well-affected part of the Assembly take much Notice of this. And it seems, there was in this Assembly, one Occasion Odder than the rest, to take Notice of it.</P>
<P>There was a Pepresentative of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> who formerly failing in with the Interests of the Country, so provoked Col. <HI>Dudley,</HI> that in a Printed Pamphlet, published by him, (or the Person who wrote for him, so as to make it He) he reproached the Country, That such a Figure
<PB N="21" REF="002214_0024_0FDACF0CD6DC3FC8"/>should be made in the Assembly, by one who was then a practising <HI>Sow-Gelder.</HI> This practising <HI>Sow-Gelder,</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> calls him) was a Member of this Assembly, and unto the Surprize of the whole House, tack'd about, and went over to Col. <HI>Dudley's</HI> Interests; tho' 'tis not many Months ago, that we have (now in <HI>London</HI>) his Hand with others, unto an Honest Letter to that Ho∣nourable Person, Sir <HI>Henry Ashburst,</HI> to sollicit his Endea∣vours to deliver the Country from a Plot against the Charter, and all the Courts of Justice in it, with a Sham Court of Chancery, (or rather of Bribery) which Gov. <HI>Dudley</HI> was then pursuing. We are told, he has (for we know not what Reasons) a Number in the House▪ who resign themselves up to him, for him to do almost what he will with them; they follow <HI>his</HI> Dictates. The main things that have been carried in the late Assembly at <HI>Boston,</HI> otherwise than they should have been, are owing to his Dexterous Operations. Every Body said, <HI>This Man has in his Eye a</HI> Bribe, <HI>as the Re∣ward of his Apostacy.</HI> He'll certainly be made a <HI>Justice,</HI> as soon as his Drudgery in gaining the <HI>Vote</HI> aforesaid, is over! It came to pass;—As soon as the <HI>Sham Vote,</HI> which has abused the World in your Foolish News Letter yonder, was Gained, the Governour draws the Council in, to Consent, unto their own Immortal Honour, that this Gentleman <HI>Sow-Gelder</HI> should be made a <HI>Justice of the Peace!</HI> Fy Gentlemen, What d'ye do? — And so the <HI>Worshipful</HI> of the County of <HI>Essex,</HI> have the practising <HI>Sow-Gelder</HI> aforesaid, (it was Mr. <HI>Dudley</HI> who taught us to call him so!) sit on the Bench with them. Whether the <HI>Cattel</HI> are in less Danger, or the <HI>People</HI> in more, since this Promotion, we who are Strangers to the Man, except by hearsay, know not; we suppose there never was a <HI>Sow-Gelder</HI> made a Justice, except in <HI>New-England,</HI> and that not till <HI>Dudley</HI> was their Governour.</P>
<P>But, it were good Advice for the People of <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eng∣land,</HI> in chusing Representatives, to beware of chusing any, who have their Obligations to their Governours,
<PB N="22" REF="002214_0025_0FDACF0EDF4D1790"/>for their Preferments and Employments. The fewer you have in your Assemblies under such Temptations, the more Faithfully are your Affairs like to be carried on. You will Pardon Strangers, if their Good Will to you, make them so far Medlers, as to offer you their Opinion.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE House of Representatives then <HI>Firmly Believe, and are of Opinion,</HI> That their Governour was not Concerned in Trading with <HI>Vetch, Borland,</HI> and <HI>Lawson.</HI> Others do Firmly Believe the contrary. Because, divers Traders have own'd, and said before many Witnesses, that their Governour did know, and allow of what they did; <HI>Vetch</HI> doth himself Confess it, in his Petition to the Queen. And when one of them swears in the Governour's Vindication, he only means, that the Gov. was not concern'd as a Merchant or Partner with them. He Ship'd nothing; there was nothing Ship'd on his Account. All this is nothing to the Purpose. And tho' Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> should be Clear of having any thing to do with these Three Grateful Merchants, yet there is another who is able to make discoveries.</P>
<P>In the same Condemnation with the Three aforesaid, there was at this Time, under Imprisonment, by Vertue of the Sentence which the <HI>General Assembly</HI> had illegally, (and it now appears Oppressively) passed upon him, for a part in an unlawful Trade, one Captain <HI>Rouse.</HI> The last General Assembly growing sensible of his Con∣dition, Voted his being let out upon Bail, that he might enjoy his Liberty. But for a Reason, which he will tell in due Time, the Vote was in a great Measure Eluded.</P>
<P>It is Reported by some now in <HI>London.</HI> That the Assembly's Vote to set <HI>Rouse</HI> at Liberty, was made very Insignificant, by the means of one said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be a <HI>Tory</HI> Judge, one <HI>Leveret.</HI> And they say that <HI>Dudley</HI> has made that
<PB N="23" REF="002214_0026_0FDACF0FD37D1708"/><HI>Tory</HI> Lawyer to be President of their <HI>Colledge.</HI> No Que∣stion but the Lawyer will bring up Hopeful Young Divines, to be sent hither for my Lord of <HI>London</HI> to Ordain them. We hear that they have sung the <HI>Gloria Patri</HI> in their Colledge-Hall already, and that several of their Clergy stood up at it. An Auspicious beginning under their Lawyer President, who, we also hear, was Chosen a Lieutenant of their Artillery Company at <HI>Boston,</HI> the last Summer. Such Reports as these, make their Friends here, think that the People in <HI>New-England</HI> are running Mad.</P>
<P>But to proceed with Capt. <HI>Rouse.</HI> Several of his Let∣ters are come to <HI>London,</HI> by which we Understand,
<Q>That he having been sent unto <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> on a Service for the Publick, in which he did Good Service, retur∣ned Home under a Languishing Sickness. A way being by this first Voyage open'd for a Private Trade between <HI>Port-Royal</HI> and <HI>Boston,</HI> he was Invited into a new Tra∣ding Voyage; being told, <HI>He had Eaten the Sowre, he should now eat the Sweet.</HI> Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> told him, <HI>His main Business was to Steer clear of the Officers of the Custom-House.</HI> And the matter was proposed so Ad∣vantageously, that <HI>some Body</HI> pressed him to make the Governour a Present of an Hundred Pounds, for the Liberty and Advantage which was to be allow'd him. Because he lay Sick, he <HI>had</HI> nothing, and <HI>saw</HI> nothing aboard, but what had been Ship'd by others Concerned in the Voyage. He went and made the best of his Goods; and for <HI>this,</HI> and nothing but <HI>this,</HI> he under∣went a Fine of <HI>Twelve Hundred Pounds.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Divers Persons, and especially a certain Lady, came to him several times in the Prison, before his Tryal; and this as from the Governour, to perswade him and the rest, to Petition the Assembly to take the <HI>Tryal</HI> into their own Hands; (which the Governour had himself pro∣posed unto the Assembly) with many fair Promises, that in a Week's time, or very quickly, the Governour would so manage the Assembly, as to bring them abroad again, without any further Trouble. Continual Communica∣tions
<PB N="24" REF="002214_0027_0FDACF1152C14500"/>passed between <HI>Roxbury</HI> and the Prison; and those good Offices were done, for which <HI>Paul Dudley,</HI> the Governour's Son, received of <HI>Borland</HI> and <HI>Lawson</HI> (as they have affirmed) at one time, a Present of <HI>Eighteen Pounds.</HI> They came with frequent Messages, to keep Captain <HI>Rouse</HI> in a good, pliant, silent Humour, and prevent his telling of Tales. Just before his Trial, a Messenger came from the Governour to him, to Desire him, <HI>That if the Governour should say any Sharp Things to him, he would not Retort any thing, or Misconstrue it; for he might assure himself he was his hearty Friend.</HI> He would carry on the General Assembly as far as was Convenient, but then, at last, bring off the Matter, and prevent their doing any Harm. Capt. <HI>Rouse</HI> according∣ly kept Counsel; the Tryal went on, and the Fine anon, proves as we told ye, <HI>Twelve Hundred Pounds.</HI> The Governour's Son, could not demand of <HI>Rouse,</HI> as he did of <HI>Cauphin,</HI> a Present of Twenty Pounds to the Gover∣nour, for bringing his Fine so low.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this, Capt. <HI>Rouse</HI> is frequently Sollicited to make the Governour a Present of <HI>Five or Six Hundred Pounds;</HI> with Assurances, that the Governour would find a way for his Liberty, tho' he were now Imprison'd by an Act of the Assembly. He still Refused it; resol∣ving to wait for Her Majesty's Dissallowance of that Illegal Act. He wrote Letters to the Governour, In∣treating him to procure a Mittigation of his Hard Cir∣cumstances, because he had done nothing, but with Countenance from his <HI>Excellency.</HI> The Governour told the Messenger, that <HI>Rouse</HI> must Write another Sort of Letter to him; which the Messenger Explained, with telling him, that he must Write, <HI>That the Governour had no Concern with what was done.</HI> But this he would never do. We hear that he continues Waiting for an Opportunity, to bring more fully to Light, many other things, besides those that have been Mentioned.</Q></P>
<P>These being the main Strokes of what Captain <HI>Rouse</HI> has thought sit as yet to Declare of his Case; we don't Wonder that the Practising <HI>Sow-Gelder</HI> thought fit to
<PB N="25" REF="002214_0028_0FDACF12D42A1C00"/>Castrate the Vindicating Vote of <HI>Rouse</HI>'s Name: But we may well Wonder, that the House would be drawn into a Vote, that was design'd for a Blind, and a Sham, to Impose on People at a Distance; and yet, at such a Distance as we are, we can see through it! At the same time, the Counsellors and Representavies, even the most Ancient <HI>Blanchers</HI> among them, would (as we are assured) freely say to the Expostulators of their Conduct, which they every where met withal, <HI>That if the Governour had put them upon clearing him from gross Briberies and Cor∣ruptions, they could not have cleared him.</HI> Well, but why dont they search into those things? For they have a Tendency to Debauch and Ruine the Country, and make it a vile, and a Forlorn Country. We are told, their An∣swer is, 'Tis <HI>too Big a Thing</HI> for them to Manage: They Wish the Queen would grant a <HI>Commission of Enquiry.</HI> And People have been afraid to tell what they know; for the Governour and his Son, between them, have (thought they) Numberless Ways to come up with 'em, and, it may be, they will Press their Sons to the <HI>Castle,</HI> or elsewhere; from whence they shall be sold unto Merchant Ships, and sent out of the Country. Or, they may short∣ly have some Cause in Court, where the Queen's Attor∣ney (the Governour's Son) Reigns <HI>Lord and King;</HI> and will take Effectual Care that the Cause go against them. Others go on, <HI>That these are little things; they do so in</HI> England; <HI>such things must be born with!</HI> Which is in∣deed, a Cruel Reproach to the Queens Government. And lastly, the Sharpest of all will tell ye, <HI>Oh! the Governour is our Father; we must not be such Sons of</HI> Cham, <HI>as to uncover the nakedness of our Father.</HI> And thus until the New Governour arrive, who being a Man of Integrity, will Honour himself by a Strict Enquiry into such things, there is like to be no Distinct Account brought in to Infor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the World.</P>
<P>What wicked <HI>Bribes,</HI> by a Juggling Management be∣tween the Governour and his Son, [for, as we Told you before, <HI>You must go to my Son!</HI>] are Extorted on all the Occasions in the World!</P>

<P>We don't wonder to see the <HI>Addresses</HI> for such a Gover∣nour's Continuance, come over hither, sign'd by his <HI>Commission Officers.</HI> They are but Addresses for their own Continuance. The Royal Wisdom is not so to be Im∣pos'd on. But we can't but smile to see the <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gy</HI> of <HI>New England</HI> so easily drawn in to Sign <HI>Addresses</HI> of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. We are glad, that we can't see the Hands of the most eminent Ministers to these <HI>Addresses.</HI> By which we gather, that the Governour has sent his Emissaries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and there into Country Towns, and surprizes their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ministers alone, and so many Arts of Insinuation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that they have not Presence of Mind enough, to refuse a <HI>Subscription</HI> unto any thing that is offered
<PB N="27" REF="002214_0030_0FDACF1610E77808"/>them. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see the Ministers of <HI>Boston,</HI> nor th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judicious Minist of <HI>Ronbury,</HI> your Governours's Past<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to any of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which you have been wheedled into, not at all to your Credit here.</P>
<P>Certainly, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese Honest Gentlemen come to see the Practices of their Governour discovered, they will with Grief and Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne reflect upon the Addresses, by which they have too far made themselves <HI>Parties</HI> to such a Governour. Some of them will consider, Whether they had not best follow the Noble Pattern which their Judge <HI>Sewall</HI> has given them Gentlemen, Such things as by common Fame, you know to be in the Conduct of your Governour, are not things which must needs render <HI>a Man acceptable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and to all Good Men.</HI>—That Expression were fitter for Pens of <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> than of <HI>New-England</HI> Ministers. You ought, with some Re∣morse to make a Retractation of such a Passage as that, which we hear (by Letters, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we have not seen it) is in one of your <HI>Addresses.</HI> We hope you Teach your People better things!</P>
<P>You are generally, so fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as we hear, Good, Pious, Faithful Men, and Blessings to your People. But if we may be worthy to advise you, we think, you would do well to resolve, that you will never Sign <HI>Addresses</HI> of this Nature, till you have had Opportunity in some <HI>Conven∣tion</HI> (if you have such Things, for we are Strangers to your Methods) to Discourse with one another, how far it may be Convenient.</P>
<P>We have heard, that of old Time, there were some <HI>Oxen,</HI> who had the Wisdom to Resolve, that they would no, one of them, have any Talk with <HI>Monsieur</HI> the <HI>Lyon,</HI> apart: Allow us to tell you, if you go on Signing such <HI>Addresses,</HI> you will strangely undermine your own Au∣thority among your People, and Sacrifice your own Reputation to your Governours. You'll tempt them to say, <HI>That you'll set your Hands to any thing.</HI> Your Pre∣decessors would not have done as you have done. And, what a <HI>Sword</HI> do such <HI>Addresses</HI> put into your Resolute Governours Hands? He may now Oppress you, or any
<PB N="28" REF="002214_0031_0FDACF17545FFCF8"/>of yours, to the last Degree, and you have Tied your yourselves up from ever Complaining of him. Were not GOD merciful to you in removing such a Governour, you had <HI>Inslaved</HI> your Country before you are aware of it. If you'll permit such as are no <HI>Clergy-men</HI> to address you with Stories out of old <HI>Councils,</HI> we could tell you, That the First Council of <HI>Orleans,</HI> A. C. 52. made a strange Decree, <HI>That if a Bishop Ordain a Slave, to be a Priest, knowing him to be a Slave, he shall pay double the Price of him to his Master.</HI> We know not well, what sort of a World it was when this Decree was made. All that we move you to, Gentlemen, is, That at your next General Council, you would make a Decree, <HI>That none of you shall be Slaves, or do any thing that shall fasten the Fetters of Slavery upon your People.</HI> We believe, that if you had known your <HI>Addresses</HI> would ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come too late, (as some of them have) and exposed you to be Laughed at, you would have had more Wit, than to have done as you have. We suppose you have heard what befell the Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> for permitting his Servant to take a Bribe, and what was lately done to Sir <HI>J. T.</HI> because he did like your Governour, take a Bribe to promote the passing a Bill. Certainly, if you had known your Governour had been guilty of such Briberies, and other Male-Administrations, as not only Christian, but Heathen Princes have punish'd with the greatest Severity, you would not have signed your <HI>Ignorant Addresses.</HI></P>
<P>Before we we proceed to give an Account of the late Shameful Expedition of the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> against <HI>Port Royal,</HI> we shall take some farther Notice of what Gen∣tlemen worthy of Credit do assure us. One writes, that a Gentleman in <HI>New-England,</HI> when he first heard, that Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> had obtained a Commission to be Governour there, said, <HI>That he could not believe, that a Man who had been a Traytor to his Country; and an Apostate from the Religion in which he had been Educated, and had Murder'd two Men at</HI> New-York, <HI>better, and more Righteous than himself, would prove a good Governour.</HI></P>
<P>Another Letter says, That the Misery of that People
<PB N="29" REF="002214_0032_0FDACF18D375DF60"/>of late, has been in their <HI>Councellors,</HI> as well (tho' not so much) as in their Governour. The Priviledges which they enjoy by their present <HI>Charter,</HI> are Great and Singu∣lar: For, no Man, but such as the People shall nominate by their Representatives, can be of the Governour's Coun∣cil. Nor, may there be any <HI>Judge,</HI> or <HI>Justice of the Peace,</HI> but what the Council thus chosen by the Representatives of the People shall Consent unto. So that they may, and ought to be <HI>Shields</HI> unto the People, by keeping ill Men from being in Places of Power. Yet we hear, that their Governour has made a Number of very unfit Men to be their <HI>Justices;</HI> and this with the Consent of his Council, without which he could make none. So that it seems, these Great Priviledges signify but very little, thro' the Busillanimity, and Unfaithfulness of their Go∣vernour's <HI>Counsellors,</HI> who will, too many of them, consent to almost any thing that he would have them. Witness, besides the things already mentioned, among other innu∣merable Instances, so many of them consenting to have a Fort built at <HI>Pemaquid,</HI> and a stated Salary settled upon the Governour, and other Officers, by which they had like to have enslaved their Country at once.</P>
<P>The Representatives are also to be blamed, in that they do not <HI>Change their Counsellors.</HI> We know that they want Men fit for Government. Nevertheless, we doubt not but in the large Province of <HI>Massachusett's,</HI> there may be found an Hundred Men, as fit for Counsellors, as <HI>S. S.</HI> or <HI>J. C.</HI> or <HI>P. T.</HI> [we deal more tenderly with them, in giving but the First Letters of their Names, than they have dealt with the Honourable <HI>Nathanael Higginson,</HI> whom they have, by Name at large vilified, as a <HI>Scanda∣lous and Wicked Accuser.</HI>] And others, who by their Obsequiousness to <HI>Dudley</HI> have justly forfeited the Love of the People.</P>
<P>Had their Representative the Wisdom frequently to Change their Counsellors, it would make them more Careful to study the Interest of their People, and not that so they may please their Governour, and Stigmatize better Men than themselves, in their <HI>Boston</HI> News Letter, only because they <HI>Slandered</HI> Dudley <HI>in a Matter of Truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="002214_0033_0FDACF1A62B7D140"/>
We are also advised from <HI>New England,</HI> That <HI>Dudley</HI> has Exposed himself to the whole Colony of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> They Dislike him there more Universally than in the <HI>Massachuset's.</HI> For he is not in a Capacity to <HI>Bribe</HI> Men there with his Commissions, Civil or Military. But he has joined a Hellish Malice with the worst of Men, and greatest Enemies of the <HI>Charter</HI> belonging to that Colony, in seeking to disturb them in the quiet Possession of their Lands. A Commission was obtained, in which <HI>Dudley</HI> was Chief, but others, who pretended to have a Right to great Tracts of Land, were put into the <HI>Commission,</HI> with Power to be Judges of their own <HI>Pretensions;</HI> the like to this has been seldom known. But when that Honourable Gentleman, who has Condescended to be their Agent, discovered the Fraud of this Affair before the Queen in <HI>Council,</HI> Praying that Her Majesty would pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some Re∣markable <HI>Discountenance</HI> on said <HI>Dudley,</HI> that <HI>Commission</HI> was soon Vacated, to his no little Confusion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<P>THAT Honourable Person before-mentioned, who is here Appearing on the Behalf of one of the <HI>New-English</HI> Colonies, which Col. <HI>Dudley</HI> has been seeking to Enslave, saw cause to Conclude his Petition, with a Com∣plaint against him in these Terms; <HI>Your Majesty's Name and Authority is abused to serve some</HI> Dark Designs <HI>of his own.</HI> It seems he has been used to <HI>Dark Designs;</HI> but if ever <HI>Dark Designs</HI> were to be suspected, it has been in the Business of that Late Expedition to <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> an Expedition, that besides the everlasting Disgrace of it, has entirely Ruined the Country, and made it highly Necessary for another Governour to be sent thither, to rescue that poor People, if it be possible, from Extirpa∣tion. We have pretty <HI>Broad Hints</HI> of an <HI>Unlawful Trade</HI> carried on with the Fort at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> And besides the things already mentioned, it is well known, that
<PB N="31" REF="002214_0034_0FDACF1BD57A13D0"/><HI>Flags of Truce</HI> passed between <HI>Port-Royal</HI> and <HI>Boston,</HI> the Officers of the Custom-House at <HI>Boston,</HI> were Obstructed from going aboard those Flags of Truce, that so the Trade carried on with the Enemy, might be Concealed. And when Goods have been Siezed on Board the Flags of Truce, they have been again taken out of the Hands of the Officers. But we must now proceed to a Sadder Story. The Short of the Story is this. But the <HI>Dark Designs</HI> must be left for another Judgment.</P>
<P>When the War first broke out, the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> especially the Trading part of the Country, and those that were more immediately concern'd in the Fishery, were very Uneasy to see <HI>Port Royal,</HI> which was then of no considerable Strength, advancing into a Capacity of Distressing, if not ruining the Province. It is so near, and so seated, as to have all immaginable Advantage to Anni∣mate, and Supply the <HI>Indians,</HI> by <HI>Land;</HI> and by <HI>Sea,</HI> with <HI>Privateers,</HI> to Destroy their Fishery, and Ruin all their other Trade, by intercepting, and taking their Vessels, both Outward and Inward Bound. Their <HI>Fort</HI> was but an <HI>Embryo,</HI> and it was thought they might have been easily Suppressed.</P>
<P>The <HI>New-Englanders</HI> understood by a <HI>Port-Royaller</HI> fal∣ing into their Hands, that at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> they had not yet Heard of the War broken out. Whereupon Gover∣nour <HI>Dudley</HI> was earnestly Sollicited, and his Leave In∣treated by some, to go and Destroy that Nest of <HI>Hornets,</HI> which was like to be so grievous a growing Plague to the Country; with Offers to raise Volunteers sufficient for that Purpose; But the Proposal was rejected; which made People suspect some <HI>Dark Designs,</HI> and that <HI>Port-Royal</HI> was reserved for some special Advantages not Obvious to the Vulgar.</P>
<P>Afterwards, when the Governour could no longer with∣stand the Cry of the Country, Col. <HI>Church</HI> was allow'd to go. The Assembly procured a Mortar Piece, and pro∣vided Bombs, and other things convenient, and had some Eye upon the Fort, which was then finish'd. Yet the said <HI>Church</HI> not only had the Taking of the <HI>Fort</HI> left out
<PB N="32" REF="002214_0035_0FDACF1D53539DD8"/>of his Orders, but was positively <HI>Forbidden</HI> to Meddle∣with it. And he hath since affirm'd to many Gentlemen, that he could with all the Ease imaginable have Taken the Fort, but that he had been so strictly and menacingly <HI>Forbidden</HI> to meddle with it, that he durst not; but only ravaged the Naked Country. <HI>Church</HI>'s Soldiers were all <HI>Volunteers,</HI> and an <HI>Ast of the Assembly</HI> had promised them a certain Share of the Plunder: But the Chief Commanders first made a large Present out of it to the Governour; and then <HI>Hs,</HI> joyning with them, cut off the Army of Half that the <HI>Publick Faith</HI> had Engaged them; which it was feared, would have proved a lasting Discouragement to all <HI>Volunteers</HI> for the Service of the Crown and the Country: And the House of Representatives Remonstrated unto the Governour, this among other Grievances; but were rejected with Obstinate Contempt.</P>
<P>The Reason pretended by the Governour, for prohibiting <HI>Church's</HI> meddling with the Fort, was, <HI>That he had laid the Matter before the Queen, and had yet received no Orders about it.</HI> Tho' the same Objection still continued, yet the People being extreamly desirous that a Period might be put to their Miseries from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and a way open'd for the Deliverance of so many Scores of poor <HI>English</HI> Captives, likely to Languish for ever in the <HI>Indian Wigwams,</HI> moved for another Expedition above a Year ago. The Governour now gives a Commission for Taking the Fort; but whether with any <HI>Dark Designs,</HI> we are yet <HI>in the Dark.</HI> After the Instructions were drawn up, there was a Clause Tack'd at the End of them, which gave the Army leave to come off when they would, if they should imagine, they could not presently Finish their Business to their Minds. It was the Tacking this unobserved Clause at last, that confounded all, and brought on a Story, which all the Letters from <HI>New-England</HI> we have yet seen, say, <HI>They Blush to Write it.</HI> And that is the Reason why we can give but a Short Account of it. In short, there was an Army of as likely Men as can be imagined, the best part of Two Thousand of them; and as well provided with Ammunition, Provision, and all things
<PB N="33" REF="002214_0036_0FDACF1ED2870EA8"/>Necessary, as a Willing Country could afford. But, when it comes to Execution, quite Contrary to the best Advice of them who knew the Place, the landed several Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> off the Fort, when they might have Landed close by, and probably at once have taken it. However, Land they did; and Drove the Enemy before them, and Chased them into the Fort with much Courage, and all the Encouragement that could be. The Men, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them Justice, Fought like Men, and would have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any thing in the World. — But, lo, the Issue! The <HI>Deptford</HI>-Man of War, which was <HI>Commodore</HI> of the Fleet, had Express Orders from the Governour, <HI>That he should not Expose the Queen's Ship.</HI> Which Orders he afterwards Exposed in the <HI>Coffee-Houses.</HI> An Engineer was fetch'd from <HI>New-York,</HI> where the People from the beginning foretold what would be the Conclusion.</P>
<P>The Governour's Youngest Son, <HI>William Dudley,</HI> was there too, in the Quality of a Secretary of War; and tho' he were little more than a <HI>Boy,</HI> yet he was a <HI>Son,</HI> and the Army soon Cry'd out of being <HI>Boy-ridden.</HI> The General, a Man of no Con∣duct, having Signaliz'd something of a <HI>Belluine</HI> Courage in some <HI>Indian</HI> Encounters, the <HI>Mob</HI> ('tis said) was set upon having him to be a Commander. They landed as we said; but then they ne∣ver made a <HI>Formal Demand</HI> of the Fort; they never carried a∣shore a <HI>Mortar</HI> or a <HI>Field Piece;</HI> they never threw up a <HI>Shovel∣ful</HI> of Earth. The Business was so managed, between certain Persons, that altho' at a <HI>Council of War,</HI> one Day it was Voted. That the <HI>Fort</HI> should be attack'd, it was by'nd by, Unvoted again. The Engineer had wrought upon sundry Captains, to make 'em Believe, <HI>That the taking of the Fort was Impracticable.</HI> They most of them gave it under their Hands to their Wise General, <HI>That it was their Opinion, it was best for them to Draw off.</HI> The Soldiers began also to be Dispirited, for some had Blabb'd among them a Secret, which, when it came to be known, made them out of their Witts. Tho' it was known and Pub∣lished here in <HI>London,</HI> before the Fleet was Returned from <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> The General Assembly had Agreed and Engaged, That if the Fort were taken, it should immediately be Demo∣lished; and without this Assurance the Army would never have proceeded. But <HI>some Body</HI> now, Indiscreetly let'em Under∣stand, that the Governour had some <HI>Dark Designs,</HI> to put a Trick upon them, and had given him Orders not to demolish the Fort: Whereupon the Inraged Army said, <HI>They had now nothing to do, but Fight themselves into a Prison!</HI> They were mostly Good Livers at Home, and could not bear the Thoughts on't, that half the
<PB N="34" REF="002214_0037_0FDACF2052829238"/>Army, (no Man knowing whether it might not be his own share) should be Confined there one long Winter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remote Garrison, and perhaps, Two Winters after that; or until they should Buy themselves a Release upon as hard Terms, as the poor Country Soldiers have, to get out of the Castle at <HI>Boston.</HI> Well: A Packet is Dispatch'd unto the Governour of <HI>Boston,</HI> to Signify their Opinion, and to Pray his Excellency's further Pleasure. But in three or Four Days after the sailing of the Packet, and before it was Possible for them to hear from <HI>Boston,</HI> they drew off in great Confusion, and Weigh'd Anchor, and came away. But as they were in the midst of their Dispersion, there came Or∣ders to stop as many of them, as were together at <HI>Casco-Bay.</HI> From thence they sent three Persons to acquaint the Governour with the Miserable Affair; whereof one was the <HI>Engineer</HI> afore∣said. They had a very melancholly, and almost a tumultuous Reception by the People; and when they were, at their first Land∣ing upbraided with Cowardice, their Answer still was, <HI>That the Fault was at Home; and they had gone as far as their Orders would bear them out;</HI> with sundry such Reflections, which bore hard upon the Government. The Council were informed of this Discourse; But there was no Notice taken of it. And tho' they were Chidden by the Governour, in the Council Chamber, yet we understand, they were Hugg'd and Caress'd by him below Stairs, to the great Scandal of the People. The People were now in a mighty Ferment. It was the Universal Opinion, that if the Army had only staid, and Play'd at <HI>Coits</HI> in their Camp (far enough from the Fort) at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> the Fort would have been within a few Days surrendred to them. The Soldiers with∣in were Mutinous to the last Degree; Deserters daily came over. Provisions would have grown Scanty in a little Time. [Tho' the Lodgings of their Men were not now thatch'd; (the Reason why we told you before) yet a red-hot Bullet or two slung into the Fort, might have set them all on Fire.] Ten thousand things might have happened. But, like Men afraid of having the Fort fall into their Hands, they ran back to <HI>New-England</HI> as fast as their <HI>Canyas</HI> Sails could carry them.</P>
<P>The Good <HI>Women</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> could not forbear their Out-cries, when they met in the Streets, on this Occasion. Says one of them, <HI>Why, our Cowards imagined the Fort at</HI> Port-Royal <HI>would fall before them, like the Walls of</HI> Jericho. Another Answers, <HI>Why did not the Block heads then stay out Seven Days to see? What a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd the Traitors to come away in Five Days Time after they got there?</HI> The Cry of the People must be Satisfved. Another Ship of War was fitted our, and Recruits of Soldiers were sent unto the Fleer, which now lay at <HI>Casco Bay.</HI> Which after Tedious and Ex∣pensive Delays of many Weeks, set Sail from thence again to <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t-Royal,</HI> but with the greatest Aversion that ever was in the
<PB N="35" REF="002214_0038_0FDACF222829CCA0"/>Hearts of Men; and not until they had been further weaken<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by many and numerous Desertions. While they were on the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Voyage to <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> a Man of War arrived from <HI>Portugal;</HI> the brave Commander (a <HI>New Englander</HI>) was ready to venture his Ship and Life too on this Occasion; and chearfully com∣plied with Orders which were with some ado obtained, for him to go to Port-Royal after them. Our Fleet arriving there a Second Time, found that in the time of their withdraw to <HI>Casco,</HI> the <HI>Port-Royallers</HI> had much Recruited themselves; and had Taken and carried in some <HI>English</HI> Vessels, laden with Provisi∣on; and had also Dispatch'd away their Galley for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, after a little Skirmish on the opposite Shore, and some Follies not to be mention'd, away they come for <HI>Boston,</HI> without Orders, and before Capt. <HI>Paddon</HI> could have Opportu∣nity to come up with them. So that the Second Expedition was as Bad, or Worse than the First. After the Expedition was thus Shamefully Finish'd, there was another Difficult <HI>Card</HI> to Play; that was, to <HI>Satisfy the General Assembly,</HI> which was then quickly to sit. The Way pitch'd upon was, to make a Pretended <HI>Court-Martial,</HI> to Enquire into the Cause of the Mismanage∣ments at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> This Court was the Ridicule of Town and Country. No Body was Try'd at it, or so much as Accused. All was carried on in <HI>Hugger-Mugger.</HI> We can Hear of Nothing done; but the Presenting of the Secretary of War, <HI>Will. Dudley,</HI> with all the Plunder that was taken, and amounted to between One and Two Hundred Pounds, and then leave to go Home! It is plain, the General was not to be Impeached there; 'tis well, if it has not Ruined the Governour, as well as the Distressed Country, yet we hear the Governour, before the Sitting of the said Court, gave him an Order for an Advantagious Post at the <HI>East∣ward,</HI> to Build a Fort at <HI>Saco,</HI> because he would not Take one at <HI>Port-Royal;</HI> as High and rich a Post, as he was ever capable of.</P>
<P>And so much for <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> until the <HI>Dark Designs</HI> come into further Light. And then it will be known whether Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> when he saw the Country was Violently set upon going, and so Interrupting his Trade with the <HI>French,</HI> had not a Secret De∣sign, that the Fort at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> should have been made (as the Fort at <HI>Pemaquid</HI> would have been) a Convenient Place for the <HI>Fur-Trade</HI> with the <HI>Indians,</HI> whereby himself, and some Friends of his here, in <HI>Britain,</HI> would have got no little Riches. In the mean time, under his Admirable Conduct, an Impoverish'd Country has, (as we are credibly informed) been put to above Two and Twenty Thousand Pounds Charge, only to be Laughed at by their Enemies, and Pitied by their Friends.</P>

To the <HI>QUEEN</HI>'s most Excellent Majesty.</P>
<P>The Humble Petitition of Your Majesty's most <HI>Loyal</HI> Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inhabitants in your Majesty's Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> or T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ding thither. Sheweth,</P>
<P><HI>THAT Collonel</HI> Joseph Dudley, <HI>whose Arbitrary and Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nical Proceedings had Exposed him to the just</HI> Resentments <HI>of his Country-men, before the Happy</HI> Revolution, <HI>hath been never∣theless so Fortunate, as to obtain the Government of the</HI> Massa∣chusett's <HI>Colony in</HI> New-England.</P>
<P><HI>That your</HI> Petitioners <HI>are certainly Informed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of diverse Grie∣vous Corruptions and Oppressions, and unjust and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtial Practices of the said.</HI> Dudley, <HI>on which they might Ground many Complaints against him, but they are so sensible of the imminent Danger which Threatens</HI> Your Majesty's <HI>Subjects in that and the Neighbouring Colonies, thro' his Male Administrations, that they at this time Beg Leave Humbly and Singly to represent to your Majesty,</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the said</HI> Dudley <HI>hath Countenanced a private Trade and Correspondence with</HI> Your Majesty's <HI>Enemies, the</HI> French <HI>at</HI> Cana∣da, <HI>and the</HI> Indians <HI>which are in their Interest, Furnishing them with Ammunition and Provision.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Persons managing the said Correspondence, pretended a Voyage to</HI> Newfoundland, <HI>and being accused of</HI> High-Treason <HI>by the</HI> General Assembly <HI>of</HI> New-England, <HI>the said Governour by his Interest and Power, delayed their Prosecution, till the Ammu∣tion with which he had furnished the Enemy was used by them, to the</HI> Destruction <HI>of</HI> Your Majesty's <HI>good Subjects, and that Colony, thereby put to</HI> Three and Thirty Thousand Pounds Charge.</P>
<P><HI>That many of the</HI> best, <HI>and most</HI> prudent <HI>Members of the Lower House of</HI> Representatives, <HI>being tired with his</HI> Delays, <HI>and necessi∣tated to go home and defend their</HI> Plantations <HI>from the Enemy, he prevailed with those that remained, who were scarce a House, that the Accusations against his Agents, should be changed from</HI> Treason <HI>to</HI> Misdemeanour; <HI>and they being</HI> Convicted, <HI>he laboured to Mitigate their Fines. All which was so Apparent to the People of</HI> New-England, <HI>that they threatned to pull down his House.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he had the Confidence nevertheless to apply to the</HI> General Assembly <HI>for an Address to</HI> Your Majesty <HI>in his Favour, but his Application was received with a General Murmur and Con∣tempt, and nothing done therein.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And altho' he hath since Endeavoured to obtain</HI> Your Majesty's Good Opinion <HI>by Collecting a Number of Names of Persons under his command and Influence to give him a</HI> Character,</P>
