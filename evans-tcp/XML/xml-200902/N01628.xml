<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>WHat I briefly offer in the following Pages, I was moved to by the Reverend Mr. <HI>George Corwin,</HI> late Minister of <HI>Salem.</HI> He liv'd greatly and justly beloved and desired, and I think died as much lamented. He was an Able, Faithful, Laborious Minister of the Gospel; and a lover of Souls, and I believe is now gone to his Everlasting Rest. When he was last in Town a few Months ago; he desired me to write some short thing, to show that <HI>Persons should seek Baptism for themselves &amp; Children; &amp; that Baptiz'd Persons when grown up, should renew their Covenant with God.</HI> He desir'd (if I Remember right) that what should be written might be <HI>adapted to the Capacity of the meanest;</HI> and might be <HI>Short</HI> also, that so it might be the more <HI>easily bought, and charitably distributed,</HI> where it might probably do good. If he had not died so soon, I believe I should scarce have begun to write so soon as I have. But quickly after I heard of his Death, this motion reviv'd in my mind, and put me up∣on fulfilling (in some poor measure) the will of the dead. I have here made a brief Essay
<PB REF="001934_0004_0FBA1E7104D69238"/>without looking into any Author, but only con∣sulting the Bible. Indeed long before his motion, I had written a <HI>Dialogue</HI> about the <HI>Lord's Sup∣per,</HI> (tho' 'tis not publish'd) and another a∣bout <HI>Baptism,</HI> tho' 'tis not yet finished, each of them much larger than this. Let what is here offer'd, he compar'd with the Scripture, try'd by that; if in any thing it disagrees thereto let it so far be rejected: But if it agrees with Scripture, and is yet disregarded by any, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such their neglect, they must answer to God the Judge of all. So far as this brief Essay, an∣swers the desire of the worthy Mr. <HI>Corwin;</HI> I say, so far, <HI>tho' he be dead, he yet speaks</HI> in it. Let those who were once under his Faithful Ministry, <HI>Remember how they have heard;</HI> and live agreeably to the truths of God which he Inculcated on them. Indeed all under the Gos∣pel, should believe it and obey it; if what is here offered shall be Instrumental of quickning any thereto, let God have all the Glory; and the un∣worthy Author be remembred in their Prayers.</P>

<HEAD>The Bonds of Baptism.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD><HI>Proposition, I.</HI> Those under the Gospel, ought to seek Baptism for themselves and for their Children.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THEY should seek it for <HI>them∣selves.</HI> For the illustrating and proving of this truth, let the following particulars be considered, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Since the Fall and Apos∣tasie of the First Man Adam, all Mankind na∣turally are Sinners, the Children of the Devil, and liable to eternal Wrath and Misery. Sin is</HI> a breach or <HI>Transgression of God's Law.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.4. Through the deceitful Temp∣lations of the Devil, our <HI>First Parents</HI> Sinned,
<PB N="2" REF="001934_0006_0FBA1E74D4F8D9C8"/>(and so deserved Death) in eating the forbidden Fruit. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.3. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.4, 6, 13. Hence the <HI>Devil</HI> is called a <HI>mur∣therer from the beginning.</HI> Joh. 8.44. The <HI>First Adam</HI> was considered as a publick Per∣son, a common Covenant—head to all his Posterity; and therefore all his Posterity were Involved in his Sin and Guilt. <HI>By one Man</HI> (that is the first <HI>Adam</HI>) <HI>Sin enter∣ed into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have Sinned—by one Man's disobedience many were made Sinners,</HI> Rom. 5.12, 19. <HI>In A∣dam all die,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.22. Thus all Men Sin∣ned in <HI>Adam;</HI> as coming from him, they are Sinful and Guilty. And so considered meerly as Sinful, they are the <HI>Children of the Devil. Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will do.</HI> Joh. 8. 44. <HI>In this the Children of God</HI> (by regenera∣tion and adoption) <HI>are manifest, and the Children of the Devil; whosoever doth not Right∣cousness, is not of God,</HI> &amp;c. Natural unrege∣nerate Men, they do not work Righteous∣ness, they cannot do the things that please God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7, 8. Therefore they are the <HI>Children of the Devil,</HI> they Imitate him, o∣bey him, follow him. <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.8. And Men considered <HI>as Sinners,</HI> are <HI>Children of Wrath by Nature.</HI> Eph. 2.3. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. <HI>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI> Gal. 3.10. Sin
<PB N="3" REF="001934_0007_0FBA1E7C76AB02A8"/>deserves, <HI>Everlasting Fire—Everlasting Pun∣ishment.</HI> Mat 25.41, 46. What has been thus briefly described, is the State and con∣dition of all Men naturally since the Fall of <HI>Adam.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>God has sent his only begotten Son the Lord Jesus Christ, into the World to destroy the works of the Devil; to Save men from Sin and Misery, to make them holy and happy.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.8. <HI>For this cause the Son of God was mani∣fested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil.</HI> Mat. 1.21.—<HI>Thou shalt call his Name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their Sins.</HI> Tit. 2.14. <HI>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniqui∣ty and purafie us to himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI> 1 Thes. 1.10.— <HI>Jesus which delivered us from wrath to come.</HI> Gal. 3.13. <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law,—being made a Curse for us,</HI> Eph. 1.4. <HI>He hath chosen us in hint, before the foundation of the World that we should be holy, and without blame before him in Love.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>God so loved the World, that the gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever be∣heveth in him, should not perish but should have everlasting Life.</HI> Christ came into the World, led an Holy Life. (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.22.) Died an accursed Death (<HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13.) that he might <HI>Save Sinners</HI> (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18) might destroy him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.14. Therefore the Scope of the Gospel is, <HI>to open Men's Eyes, turn them from Darkness to light,
<PB N="4" REF="001934_0008_0FBA1E804201AFE8"/>from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgivnes of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are Sanctified by Faith that is in Christ.</HI> Act. 26.18. Christ came into the World, to purchase Salvation for sin∣fulmen, to turn rebel men from Sin and Satan unto God, that they might be recon∣cil'd to God, love him, live to him, and be eternally happy in his Favour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>The Lord Jesus Christ is the only Saviour of Sinners.</HI> As he come to Save Sinners. (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15.) So, <HI>neither is there Salvati∣on in any other, for there is none other Name giv∣en under Heaven among Men, whereby we must be Saved.</HI> Acts 4.12. There's <HI>no remisson</HI> of Sin) <HI>without Shedding of Blood</HI> (Heb. 9.22.) <HI>not the Blood of Bulls and Goats</HI> (Heb. 10.4.) but the <HI>Blood of Jesus</HI> (1 Joh. 1.7.1 Pet. 1.19.) Who is that <HI>Lamb of God which takes away the Sin of the World.</HI> Joh. 1.29. Christ then is the only Saviour of Sin∣ners, and he is an <HI>Allsufficient</HI> one too. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25.—<HI>He is able also to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him. Whoso∣ever believeth in him, shall not perish, but shall have everlasting Life.</HI> Joh. 3.16.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>No Men can be Saved, without true Re∣pentance of Sin and Faith in Christ Jesus.</HI> I mean this, of those grown to years of Un∣derstanding, and not of such as die in In∣fancy. Many Children of professing Pa∣rents, Children of the Covenant die in In∣fancy. As such Infants are capable of be∣ing, sharers in the Sin and Guilt of the first
<PB N="5" REF="001934_0009_0FBA1E818DC037C8"/>Adam, and so becoming liable to Death; so they are as capable of having righteousness and grace from Jesus Christ the second A∣dam, and of being Saved by him. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.14. — 19.1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22.45. — 49. But as for those under the Gospel, grown to years of Understanding; they must re∣pent of Sin, if they would be Saved by Christ. They must be convinc'd of <HI>Sin.</HI> (<HI>Joh.</HI> 16.8.) <HI>Guilt.</HI> (Rom. 3.19.) <HI>Wrath.</HI> (Mat. 3.7.) They must have their hearts <HI>rent and broken</HI> for Sin. (<HI>Joel.</HI> 2.13. <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.17.) must <HI>mourn</HI> for it. (<HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10.) be <HI>sorry</HI> for it (<HI>Psal.</HI> 38.18.) <HI>Be asha∣med and confounded for their own Sinful wayes,</HI> and <HI>loath</HI> themselves for them. (<HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.31, 32.) and with such a Soul abhorrence of Sin, they must <HI>turn from all their Trans∣gressions that so Iniquity may not be their Ruin.</HI> Ezek. 18.30. Such <HI>Repentanee</HI> there must be in Persons, if they would be pardoned and Saved. <HI>Repent — for the Remission of Sins — Repent — that your Sins may be blotted out.</HI> Acts 2.38. &amp; 3.19. Christ is exalted, <HI>to give Repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of Sins.</HI> Acts 5.31. <HI>Except ye Re∣pent ye shall likewise perish.</HI> Luke 13.5. And together with this <HI>Repentance,</HI> this Soul-loathing of, and turning from Sin; there must be true <HI>Faith in Jesus Christ;</HI> even such <HI>Faith as purifies the heart.</HI> Acts 15.9. The great things Inculcated in the Gospel, are <HI>Repentace towards God, and Faith towards <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord Jesus Christ</HI> Acts 20, 21. The one of
<PB N="6" REF="001934_0010_0FBA1E830B520688"/>these is never seperated from the other, they alwayes go together. Faith in Christ is ne∣cessary in order to pardon and Salvation. <HI>He that believeth not, as condemned aheady.</HI> Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth not, shall be damned.</HI> Mark 16.16. But on the other hand, <HI>who∣soever believeth in him</HI> (that is, in Christ) <HI>shall have remission of sins; and Everlasting Life.</HI> Acts 10.43. Joh. 3.16. He therefore that with his heart, with his very Soul, mourns for his Sins, hates, loaths, turns from them; and together herewith, trust∣eth in the righteousness of Christ for Justi∣fication before God; I say, he is <HI>Justified freely by grace through the Redemption that is in Jesus.</HI> Rom. 3.21. — 25. Eph. 1.7. Rom. 5.1. and 8.1. The Soul which thus penitently trusteth in Christ, <HI>receives</HI> Christ. (<HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12.) receives him as <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Saviour</HI> (Acts 5.31.) and so yields up himself to serve Christ; <HI>to glorifie him with his Body and spirit.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.20. True faith <HI>works by love</HI> (Gal. 5.6.) puts the Soul upon obeying God. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.8. <HI>Faith without works is dead.</HI> Jam 2.26.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>It's the will God, that those who turn from Sin and Satan to Christ to live to him and be sa∣ved by him; should be known and distinguished among Men, by some outward Instituted marks, signs, or badges of their belonging to Christ.</HI> Christ was promised as the Saviour of Sin∣ners, long before he came into the World. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. As it is nothing but Christ's blood, that can <HI>Cleanse from Sin,</HI> and <HI>purge
<PB N="7" REF="001934_0011_0FBA1E8481272E68"/>the Conscience from dead Works.</HI> (1 Joh. 1.7. Heb. 9.14.) So God very early after <HI>A∣dam's</HI> Apostasie, Instituted <HI>Sacrifices</HI> to be <HI>Types, shadows, prefigurations</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> who as a <HI>sacrificed Lamb</HI> was to take away the Sin of the World. <HI>Job.</HI> 1.29. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.2.1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18, 19. Hence Christ is called, <HI>the Lamb <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the foundation of the World.</HI> Rev. 13.8. He was in types and prefigurations, slain from the foundation of the World. The Sins of Old Testament believers, were pardoned by vertue of Christs Blood that was to be shed, and that was typified by Sacrifices; the Prophets preached <HI>Remission of sins, through Faith in him.</HI> Acts 10.43. God Instituted <HI>Sacrifices</HI> as <HI>types of Christ;</HI> else <HI>Abel</HI> could not have offered his excel∣lent Sacrifice <HI>by Faith.</HI> Heb. 21.4. There∣fore of old <HI>sacrificing</HI> was <HI>Instituted by God,</HI> as an <HI>outward sign, badge, token,</HI> or <HI>action;</HI> whereby those who renounced the Devil and his works, and gave up themselves to be the Lord's Covenant Servants, trust∣ing in his mercy through the promised Messiah (or Christ) for Salvation, were <HI>known and distinguished from the rest of Man∣kind.</HI> Hence that in Psal. 50.5. <HI>Gather my Saints together unto me, those that have made a Covenant with me by sacrifice.</HI> After a while. God appointed <HI>another</HI> visible sign and <HI>seal of the Covenant,</HI> between Him and <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his <HI>seed,</HI> even <HI>Circum∣cision</HI> God himself calls this <HI>a token of the Covenant.</HI> Gen. 17.11. And it was
<PB N="8" REF="001934_0012_0FBA1E8B5DA16B30"/>the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> the Covenant which Justified a Person through Faith in Christ, who was then to come, that <HI>Circumcision</HI> was <HI>a token</HI> of. Rom. 4.11. <HI>He received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the Righteousness of Faith.</HI> About four hundred Years af∣ter this, God appointed yet <HI>another sign and seal of the Covenant,</HI> between him and his peculiar People; and that was the <HI>Passover,</HI> to be celebrated <HI>once every Year,</HI> Exod. chap. 12. The Israelites who had their Door-posts sprinkled with the Blood of the Paschal Lamb, were preserved; while the Plague destroyed the first born of the Aegyptians. And this <HI>Passover</HI> was a <HI>Type of Christ,</HI> who afterwards was <HI>Sa∣crificed for us.</HI> 1 Cor. 5.7.
<P>Thus in all past ages of the World it has been, and still is, the will of God, that those of the Apostate race of <HI>Adam,</HI> who renounce the Devil and his works, and give up themselves to Christ the Son of God, to be his Covenant People and Servants, and to trust in him for Salva∣tion; I say, it has been (and still is) the will of God, that such should be known and distinguish'd from the rest of Mankind, by some divinely <HI>Instituted badge, sign</HI> or <HI>token of the Covenant</HI> between him and them. Christ's Subjects should not be ashamed of him before men, but should wear his Livery; and by the <HI>In∣stituted signs, tokens</HI> or <HI>badges</HI> of the Cove∣nant,
<PB N="9" REF="001934_0013_0FBA1E8CCEDE1F30"/>openly profess and declare their re∣nouncing the Devil and his works, and their consecrating themselves to the Lord, to serve him as their Prince and Savi∣our, and to trust in his favour for their compleat happiness.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Under the New Testament, Baptism and the Lord's Supper are signs and seals of the Covenant of Grace.</HI> The latter of these, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Lord's supper,</HI> I shall not discourse of at present; but the former, <HI>viz. Baptism,</HI> is what the Proposition I undertook to prove, obliges me to bring under further consideration.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Baptism</HI> is a sign and seal of the Cove∣nant of Grace, of Persons being conse∣created to Jesus Christ, and Interested in his saving benefits. It signifies, their Communion with Christ in the benefits of his Death and Resurrection, in their dying to Sin and living to Righteousness. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.4—6. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.11—13. Christ's Blood is the purchasing, procu∣ring, meritorious cause of Pardon or Remission of Sins. 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 1.7. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.7. on our part, true Repentance of Sin and Faith in Christ Jesus (as was hinted be∣fore) are necessary in order to our be∣ing Pardoned. <HI>Acts</HI> 3.19. <HI>Job.</HI> 3.18. <HI>Acts</HI> 10.43. Now this Pardoning vertue of the Blood of Christ, is Signified, Re∣presented, Sealed in the holy Ordinance of <HI>Baptism.</HI> Acts 2.38. <HI>Be Baptized every
<PB N="10" REF="001934_0014_0FBA1E8E433A7250"/>one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the Remission of Sins,</HI> Acts 22.16. <HI>Arise and be Baptized, and wash away thy Sins.</HI> Bap∣tism then is a sign and seal of the Cove∣nant of Grace, when a grown Person receives Baptism, the Covenant is sealed between God and him. He professeth Repentance of Sin, trusting in Christ for Salvation, and that he will live to Christ and obey him as long as he lives. By receiving Baptism, he doth devote and consecrate, bind, ingage and oblige him∣self; to live unto, and obey God the Father, God the Son, and God the Ho∣ly Ghost, as long as he lives. And if he is sincere in this profession, if he doth heartily Repent of his Sins, and trust in Christ as offer'd in the Gospel for Sal∣vation; then Baptism is a seal on God's part, that God doth and will Pardon his Sins, and Save him for ever. <HI>Even Bap∣tism doth also now save us.</HI> 1 Pet. 3.21. Baptism obliges the Person that receives it, to die unto Sin and live unto Righte∣ousness; <HI>to answer a good Conscience towards God.</HI> 1 Pet. 3.21. It signifies a <HI>Sanctify∣ing and Cleansing.</HI> Eph. 5.26. <HI>As many of you as have been Baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</HI> Baptism is a sign, token or badge of the Christian Religion; those who receive it, are thereby and therefore obliged to live as becomes Christians; inasmuch as their names are given up to Christ, they should <HI>depart from all Iniquity,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.19.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001934_0015_0FBA1E9183EFB890"/>
I think these things show, that those who live under the Gospel, who Injoy the Revelations of God's will in his writ∣ten Word, the Holy Bible, should seek after <HI>Baptism for themselves.</HI> God in his holy Word, most plainly commands them to <HI>Repent and turn from their Sins.</HI> Acts 17.30. Ezek. 18.30. He commands them <HI>to believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.23. This is the <HI>Work</HI> God requires of them. <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.29. It's most absolutely Indispensibly necessary for Persons thus to Believe and Repent; for if they neglect it, they must certain∣ly perish for ever. <HI>Luke</HI> 13.5. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. And those who do penitently be∣lieve in Christ, should be <HI>Baptized,</HI> as a sign and seal of their consecration to him, and of their being Pardoned and Saved by him.</P>
<P>It is Christ's Command, that those who are his Disciples, Subjects, Servants should be Baptized, He said to his Apostles, Mat. 28 19, 20. <HI>Teach all Nations, Bap∣tizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son, and of Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have Com∣manded you; and to, I am with you alwayes to the End of the World. Teach</HI> them, the word signisies <HI>to Disciple,</HI> or <HI>make Disciples;</HI> 'tis as if he had said, <HI>Disciple all Nations Baptising them.</HI> Here's a plain command of Christ, that those who become his <HI>Dis∣ciples
<PB N="12" REF="001934_0016_0FBA1E93985556F0"/>Subjects, Servants,</HI> who penitently turn to him, trust in him, give themselves to him, <HI>should be Baptized.</HI> And Baptism was to be administred not only by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> but also by <HI>ordinary Ministers of the Gospel</HI> successively; because this work is to be done even <HI>to the end of the World.</HI></P>
<P>And as this was the <HI>Command</HI> of Christ, so it was <HI>obeyed.</HI> The New Testament History Informs us, that upon Persons <HI>believing in Jesus Christ,</HI> they were <HI>Bap∣tized.</HI> Thus <HI>three Thousand</HI> were <HI>Baptized</HI> in one Day, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41. Those at <HI>Sa∣maria</HI> that believed, were <HI>Baptized both Men and Women;</HI> and afterward the <HI>Eunuch</HI> also, (Acts 8.12.36—38.) and <HI>Paul,</HI> (Acts 9.18.) and <HI>Cornelius</HI> and those <HI>with him,</HI> (Acts 10.48.) <HI>Lydia</HI> and her <HI>Houshold;</HI> the <HI>Jaylor</HI> and all <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> (Acts 16. 14, 15.31, 33.) the <HI>Corinthians</HI> also, and those at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> (Acts 18.8. &amp; 19. 1.5.) the <HI>Romans,</HI> (Rom. 6.3.) and <HI>Galatians,</HI> Gal. 3.27. This Indeed was the practice, to <HI>Baptize</HI> the <HI>Disciples of Christ,</HI> and thus it ought to be to the end of the World.</P>
<P>You therefore that are come to Years of Understanding, and have been ac∣quainted with the Gospel; if you serious∣ly consider these things, you can't but know that you are Indispensably obli∣ged to Repent of Sin, and Believe in
<PB N="13" REF="001934_0017_0FBA1E97843D6B30"/>Christ Jesus, to receive him, trust in him, submit to him as Prince and Savi∣our. God's Authority, and your own welfare and Salvation, oblige you thus to do. As coming from sallen Apos∣tate Adam, you are naturally Sinful and Guilty, Children of the Devil, Children of Wrath, liable to eternal burnings in Hell; and there's no getting out of this State, but by penitently believing in Jesus Christ. All are under the pow∣er and guilt of Sin, and tyranny of Sa∣tan, till Ingrafted into Christ. Every Individual Person, <HI>is a Child of God or of the Devil,</HI> (1 Joh. 3.10.) Either with <HI>Christ,</HI> or <HI>against him,</HI> (Luke 11.23.) Either serving the Devil and going to Hell, or submitting to Christ and go∣ing to Heaven.

<ITEM>1. <HI>God's Covenant with Abraham, did ex∣tend to his seed as well as to himself.</HI> God said to him, Gen. 17.7. <HI>I will establish my Covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their Generations, for an Everlasting Covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</HI> And so <HI>A∣braham's Infant seed</HI> (that were capable of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Males</HI>) were to receive <HI>Circumcision</HI> the <HI>token</HI> (or <HI>seal,</HI> Rom. 4.11.) <HI>of the Covenant when they were eight Dayes Old.</HI> ver. 10, 11, 12.</ITEM>

<PB N="18" REF="001934_0022_0FBA1EAFD0E2E040"/>Spiritual saving Blessings, and Covenant duties. <HI>Abraham—received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of Faith, which he bad being yet uncircumcised, that be might be the Father of all them that believe, 'tho they be not circumcised— to the end the promise might be sine to all the seed, not to that only which is of the Law; but to that also which is of the Faith of Abraham, who is the Father of us all; as it is written I have made thee a Father of many Nations.</HI> Rom. 4.9.11.16, 17. <HI>They which are of Faith; the same are the Children of Abraham. And the Scripture foreseeing that God would Justify the heathen through Faith; Preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, in thee shall all Na∣tions be Blessed. So then, they which be of Faith, are Blessed with Faithful Abraham— that the Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ—And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise,</HI> Gal. 3. 7, 8, 9.14.29. These things plainly prove, that believing Gentiles are in the same Covenant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> as to <HI>Spiri∣tual Blessings,</HI> and are therefore said to be <HI>his Children, blessed with him;</HI> nay the last verse mentioned Intimates, <HI>that we are not Christ's,</HI> not united to him, nor Interest∣ed in him, unless we are <HI>Abraham's seed,</HI> that is his <HI>Spiritual seed.</HI> And since be∣lieving Gentiles are in the same Cove∣nant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> it follows.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. <HI>They ought to have the Initiating or first Seal of God's Covenant,</HI> viz. <HI>Baptism applyed to them.</HI> Infants of Professors, are now as capable of being in God's Covenant, and of receiving the Initiating Seal of it, as they were in <HI>Abraham's</HI> time. Now un∣der the New Testament, as to Spiritual Covenant Duties and Blessings; there's no difference between <HI>believing Jews, and Greeks, bond</HI> and <HI>free, Male</HI> and <HI>Female,</HI> Gal. 3.28. And yet when the Apostle urg'd the <HI>Jews to Repent and be Baptized;</HI> he added, <HI>for the promise is to you and to your Children,</HI> Act 2. 38, 39. If they repented and believed in Chirst, as thereby the Covenant promise (that God would be a God to them) would belong <HI>to them,</HI> so it would also to their <HI>Children;</HI> and therefore <HI>Baptism</HI> the Seal of the Covenant, ought to be applyed to them and their Children too. <HI>Baptism</HI> is now the
<PB N="20" REF="001934_0024_0FBA1EB5EDF35610"/>first or Initiating Seal of the Covenant, as <HI>Circumcision</HI> of old was; therefore as <HI>A∣braham</HI> of Old was to apply Circumcision to his Infant seed that were capable of it; so believing Gentiles are obliged to get <HI>Baptism</HI> applyed to their <HI>Infant seed</HI> that are capable of it, even their Male and Fe∣male Children. It seems <HI>Moses</HI> had like to have <HI>lost his Life, for neglecting to apply the seal of God's Covenant to his Child,</HI> Exod. 4.24. —26.

Of such is the Kingdom of God, of Heaven. God has taken such, as well as their professing Parents, into Covenant with himself; he has engag'd to be a <HI>God to them</HI> (Gen. 17. 7.) which comprehends in it, <HI>His preparing for them an Heavenly City,</HI> (Heb. 11.16.) and granting to them <HI>a glorious Resurrection</HI> hereafter, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.31, 32.1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.23. 42, 43, 44.

And the reason why Children should be thus instructed in the truths and ways of God, is, that they might <HI>hope in God, keep his Commandments;</HI> and might Teach and Instruct their Children after them so to do, and so successively from one Generation to another.

I think these things (which might easi∣ly have been enlarged on) may suffice to show; that such as in their minority were given up in Covenant to God, when they grow up, should know, obey, serve and worship the Lord God of their Fathers. They are comprehended in the same Cove∣nant with their Fathers, and, as they grow up and become capable of understanding, of acting rationally and deliberately, they should personally own the God of their Fa∣thers to be their God, and engage by the help of his Grace that they'l walk in all his ways, as long as they live. Jer. 50. 5—<HI>Come and let us Join our selves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant that shall not be forgotten.</HI> God's Covenant takes in <HI>Chil∣dren, little ones,</HI> as well as <HI>Parents.</HI> Deut. 29.10, 11, 12. <HI>Moses</HI> said to Israel in the <HI>Fortieth Year</HI> after they came out of Aegypt (<HI>Deut.</HI> 1.3.) when all except <HI>two Men</HI> were dead, that were numbred at <HI>Sinai,</HI> (Num. 26.64, 65.) <HI>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb.

He said to God. Psal. 119 106. <HI>I have sworn and I will perform it; that I will keep thy Righteous Judgements.</HI> Go thou and do likewise. Dost thou <HI>avouch the Lord to be thy God?</HI> then see what this obliges thee to, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26.17. Thou art a <HI>Baptiz'd Dis∣ciple</HI> of Christ, and therefore shouldst <HI>observe all things what soever he commands thee.</HI> Mat. 28.19, 20. Therefore (among other things) thou shouldst heartily and seriously come to the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> about which Christ has said, <HI>Luke</HI> 22.19. <HI>This do in Remembrance of
<PB N="30" REF="001934_0034_0FBA1EC98F45AEE8"/>me.</HI> Don't neglect this command of Christ, nor Indeed any other; show thy <HI>Love and Friendship to him,</HI> in <HI>doing what soever he Com∣mands.</HI> Joh. 15.14 and 14.15. It's in vain to profess him to be <HI>thy Lord;</HI> if thou dost not <HI>obey</HI> him, Luke 6.46. Mat. 7.21— 23. If thou wilt not <HI>obey</HI> Christ, don't ex∣pect to be Saved by him. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.9. If thou wilt not have him to <HI>Reign over thee,</HI> he'll <HI>slay thee,</HI> Luke 19.27. If thou wilt not come under his <HI>easy yoke</HI> (Mat. 11.30) Thou shalt be broken by his <HI>Iron Rod,</HI> Psal. 2.9. <HI>Cursed be the Man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant:</HI> viz. <HI>to obey God's voice,</HI> and <HI>do his Commands,</HI> Jer. 11, 3, 4.</P>
<P>It is surely a very provoking thing God, that so many in <HI>New-England</HI> neglect, <HI>Baptism</HI> for themselves and Children; and also neglect the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> Doubtless God has a controversy with the Land, be∣cause his holy Gospel is no more obeyed. I know, that a meer external attending on Ordinances, won't please God nor profit our Souls; God forbid that any should trust in it. But we should hearti∣ly Repent of Sin, Believe in the Lord Jesus, receive the Seals of his Covenant as he requires; and yield sincere, uni∣versal, unwearied Obedience to his Com∣mands, <HI>Our hearts should be right with God, and siedfast in his covenant.</HI> Psal. 78.37. <HI>The pare in heart shall see God,
<PB N="31" REF="001934_0035_0FBA1ECB56753CB0"/>without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord</HI> Mat. 5.8. Heb. 12.14. That what is thus briefly written, may quicken the Readers of it to their Duty, is the hearty Prayer of the Unworthy Author.</P>
