<HEAD>PROPOSALS Touching the Accomplishment OF PROPHESIES.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst all the Ornaments wherewith the Chaste Mother is enriched, there is none more constantly worn, or more adorning than that of the Peremptory desire of her Husband's Presence. This causes her to record the time of his departure, keep an exact reckoning of his absence; and with frequent Calculations and Enquiries, to long and look out for the appointed Season of his Expected Return. And to every Message, Letter, Bill of Exchange or Lading, the close of her dutyful Answer is,</P>
<P>—Attamen IPSE veni.</P>
<P>This Conjugal Love is Honourable in it self; and CHRIST has ennobled it, by speaking to his Church, in Phrases taken from it; <HI>My Sister! My Spouse!</HI> And we see the Churche's disposition after the Receipt of her last Letter, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 17, 20. And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come! — <HI>Amen. Even so,</HI> Come LORD JESUS!</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Anno,</HI> One Thousand Seven Hundred and Eleven, more than Sixteen Hundred Years are rolld away since CHRIST said and Writ, <HI>Surely I come Quickly.</HI> Therefore an earnest Looking out for the Time, and Place of His Appearance, must needs be very seasonable, very beautifull. And might we take it for granted that the Antichristian Plantation spoken of, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11. 45. intended their <HI>American</HI> Plantation; it would cast a great Light upon the Apocalyptical Scenes: because the Time of this Plantation is cer∣tainly
<PB N="2" REF="001647_0003_0FB3EC5069670790"/>known. The Fables that have been Written of former Plan∣tations, will give little disturbance; seeing the Godly and Learned <HI>Witsius</HI> hath said, <HI>Neque</HI> Hornij <HI>Conjecturam cassa nuce emerim.</HI> Exercit. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. p. 450. Thes. 28. Indeed, except <HI>Horn<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> had given better Words of Command for the Reduction of his <HI>Phoniden</HI> Colonies; none will be forward to chuse him for their Leader. Lib. 2. p. 129. Suppose that hidden Age afforded Unparalleld Instances of Obe∣dience; Yet how came the Net-Cattel, the Horses, the Swine by their Annihilation? To remove them from off <HI>America</HI> is hu∣manely impossible. Of these and many other Animals there was neither Name, nor Thing when the Spaniards arrived; Neither was there the use of Iron.</P>
<P><HI>Yet be shall come to his end</HI> ] Notwithstanding the great benefit accruing to Antichrist by these Plantations; yet he shall come to his end. Or, <HI>and</HI> he shall come to his end. His planting of these Tabernacles was to be a Signal, whereby the Lovers of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> might certainly know that <HI>Babylon</HI>'s downfall was near. <HI>In Media bac Plantatione aliquid sinistri accidet huic hertulane. — Subito exorietur tempestas, quae naufragium adferet huic nauclere,</HI> Alsted. de Mille annis. p. 203.</P>
<P>The Vulgar reads, <HI>Et veniet usque ad Summitatem ejus</HI>] When Antichrist should clamber up to the top of his imperial Tyranny, by extending it over the New World also; then he was to come to his End.</P>
<P>To make sure work with Antichrist, our <HI>English</HI> Translation Printed at <HI>London,</HI> 1540. expresses this End, by <HI>Death.</HI> "for he shall come to his <HI>Death.</HI> And pertinent Places of the <HI>Revelation</HI> are noted in the Margin. Antichrist is so to end, as never to begin again: No remnant of Life, no Resurrection belongs to his Death.</P>
<P>If we consider the <HI>Time</HI> of this Plantation in the New World, and the <HI>Decay</HI> of Antichrist; the Accommodation may seem fair. GOD appeared remarkably, when He raised up <HI>Nicolaum de Lyra.</HI> This Christian <HI>Jew</HI> by his learned Commentaries on the whole Bible, did very much in clearing away the Rubbish, and beginning to lay the Foundations of the <HI>New Jerusalem.</HI> This noble Work began more generally to be communicated in the year 1485. when it was Printed in a fair Character at <HI>Nuremberg.</HI> About the
<PB N="3" REF="001647_0004_0FB3EC51E9513D70"/>same time <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> was wholly taken up in Supplica∣ting Princes to afford him their Assistance in his Attempt to dis∣cover a New World. This was at last effected by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> October the Eleventh, One Thousand four Hundred Ninety and Two: and the Plantation vigorously carried on in the Years following. In the beginning of the next Century, <HI>Anno</HI> 1517. the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Reformation sprung up like the <HI>Palm</HI> Tree. The great Value <HI>Luther</HI> had for <HI>Lyra</HI> may be seen in his own Words; <HI>Ego</HI> Lyram <HI>ideo amo, et inter optimos pono, quod ubique diligenter re∣tinet, et persequitur historiam: Quanquam authoritate patrum se vinci paticur, et non nunquam eorum exemplo deflectit a proprietate sententiae, ad ineptas allegorias,</HI> Gen. 2. fol. 21. — <HI>Saepe dixi qualis Theo∣logia esset, cum ego primum hoc genus studij ingrederer. Literam di∣cebant occidere: igitur oderam ego, prae omnibus interpretibus,</HI> Lyram, <HI>quod tam diligenter literalem sententiam persequeretur. Sed nunc, hanc ipsam ob Commendationem, Omnibus fere Scripturae interpretibus eum antepono.</HI> Gen. 9. fol. 118. And <HI>Sixtus Senensis,</HI> and Dr. <HI>John Raynolds,</HI> give <HI>Lyra</HI> a very good Character.</P>
<P><HI>And none shall be able to help him.</HI>] When the Sixth Vial comes to be poured out, the Word at <HI>Rome</HI> will be,</P>
<P>— Acheronta movebo.</P>
<P>But as Heaven <HI>will</HI> not; so Hell <HI>cannot</HI> help her. When <HI>Henry</HI> the Eigth Writ a Book against <HI>Luther;</HI> Antichrist expected some considerable Help from that Quarter, and for joy thereof, gave him the Title of <HI>Defender of the Faith.</HI> In this, like <HI>Balaam,</HI> or <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> the Pontiff unawares Prophesied of the great Things that Prince and his Successors were to accomplish in abrogating the Papal Power, and Supporting the Reformation.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Daniel,</HI> 12. 7. <HI>The Scattering the Power of the holy People</HI> there mentioned, may design the same Thing that is termed <HI>Slaying the Witnesses,</HI> in the Eleventh of the <HI>Revelation.</HI> In Mr. <HI>Mede</HI>'s account, The <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Daniel</HI> is <HI>Apocalypsis Contracta:</HI> 'Tis probable the Slain Witnesses are to be found in this part of it; I know not of a more convenient Situtation. The Witnesses are clothed with Civil, and Ecclesiastical Authority: When this is taken away from them, they are slain. The <HI>Jews</HI> have no Authority: <HI>Lo∣Ammi</HI> is their proper Name. That which is not, can't be taken
<PB N="4" REF="001647_0005_0FB3EC53894CD430"/>away. Where there are neither Sheep, nor Shepherd; the She∣pherd cannot be smitten, nor the Sheep of the Flock scattered abroad. When the Witnesses are slain, then <HI>Dimiel</HI>'s People shall be delivered; <HI>All Israel shall be Saved.</HI> And this Receiving the <HI>Jews</HI> into Favour again, shall be Life from the dead to the <HI>Gentile</HI> Christians. <HI>Oecolam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dius,</HI> Dr. <HI>John Mayer</HI> Dr. <HI>Thomas Goadwin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Samuel Petto</HI> expound <HI>Dan.</HI> 12. 7. as a Prophesie of the Slaying of the Witnesses; and the Exposition seems genuine.</P>
<P>To pass to the New Testament, I have for several years sup∣posed that something of a Local consideration is couched in the Parable of the Sower recorded <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. <HI>Mark,</HI> 4. and <HI>Luke,</HI> 8. The Parable comprehends the whole Series of Gospel Administra∣tion continued to the end of the World: and that not only un∣der a general Notion, as there are all these sorts of Ground every where, and at all times: but also with notable distinguishing Chronological, and Chorographical Characters, respecting the Four Fields into which the World is parted.</P>
<P>At first the Gospel was Preached in <HI>Asia,</HI> where this precious. Seed was quickly troden down and devoured; the Government setting themselves with all Earnestness against it; and the body of the People, by a fatal Mistake, willfully chasing away the Seeds∣Men from them.</P>
<P>In <HI>Africa,</HI> the numerous flourishing Churches were quickly scorch'd and dryed up by the Vehement Heat of Persecution; not unlike the Grass in Summer, in that burning Clime. For then the Trees only dare shew their heads; as <HI>Austin</HI> observes.</P>
<P>In <HI>Europe,</HI> 'tis too well known how it was choaked with Worldly Hypocritical Interests. Tho' it continued growing there; yet these Thorns rendred it, comparatively, Unfruitfull.</P>
<P>Why may we not, without being Envied, or derided, hope that the <HI>Americans</HI> shall be made the good Ground that shall once at last prove Especially, and Wonderfully fruitfull? 'Tis to be noted that the same order of the several sorts of Ground is observed by all the Three Evangelists. This Parable marches in the Front of
<PB N="5" REF="001647_0006_0FB3EC54E9C603F8"/>all the Parables; and a mention of the Mysteries of the Kingdom, is annex'd to it in every Place of its Recital. I think [Mysteries] appears not else-where in the Gospels. In <HI>Mark,</HI> it is ushered in with a note of Attention, <HI>Hearken!</HI> And in <HI>Matthew, Mark,</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> it hath for a Conclusion that Solemn Epiphonema, <HI>He that hath Ears to hear, let him bear.</HI> Our Saviour's going into a Ship to Preach, might intimate to his Country-men, that if they re∣fused to entertain his Doctrine; He would embark, and carry his despised Gospel to far-distant Regions. Indeed He has made great use of Ships in Propagating the Christian Religion. <HI>Paul</HI> was carried in a Ship to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he had the advantage of Sowing the Truth all over the Empire. This is the only way whereby <HI>Islands</HI> are Gospellised; and whereby, in a peculiar man∣ner, the Kingdoms of the New World become the Kingdoms of our LORD, and of His CHRIST. 'Tis a great Encouragement to Ministers in these later Ages, to be diligent in Sowing, be∣cause we have reason to believe that the Evening Seed will more abundantly prosper, in <HI>Asis, Africa, Europe,</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Whether this be granted, or no; I am sure it is well for the Aboriginal Natives of <HI>America,</HI> that the Apostle, whose Emblem is the <HI>Eagle,</HI> whose Character is <HI>Love;</HI> was instructed to begin his Gospel with the Recognition of his Master's Title to the New World. For, if <HI>all</HI> Things were made by Him; and with∣out Him was not <HI>any thing</HI> made that was made: Then <HI>America</HI> was made by Him, with all its Inhabitants in all their Sorrow∣ful Circumstances. This that we call the New World, was made by Him, tho' it knew Him not. And when he Visits those that dwell in it. He comes to his Own. Oh that they would at last Receive Him! and that they might have Power given them to become the Sons of GOD, to believe in His Name! There is a fair Possibility of their being made the happy Subjects of this Royal Privilege and Authority: for all Saints are <HI>born not of blood, nor of the Will of the flesh, nor of the Will of Min; but of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>There is another portion of Scripture written by the same Apostle; the Tenth Chapter of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> which I now pass unto.</P>
<P>Altho' most Expositors take the Angel therein mentioned, to be CHRIST, the great Angel of the Covenant; yet, amongst
<PB N="6" REF="001647_0007_0FB3EC5668F978B0"/>them that I have before me, <HI>Lyranus, John Bale, John Fox, Ribera, John Mayer, Cluverus,</HI> are otherwise minded. I shall content my self with mentioning a few words of <HI>Bale,</HI> his Paraphrase on this Chapter, fol. 139, 140. <HI>In the midst of this most Vengeable time, wherein the Antichrists and Hypo∣crites most fiercly stirreth about them to vex all the World with their fiery blasts, their filthy smoke and their stinking Brimstone, to restore again their pleasant Euphrates: The Lord hath sent to the comfort of his, certain peculiar and chosen learned Men, most constantly to defend his Verity: and them this present Revelation compareth to a strong Angel. This Angel was cloathed with a Cloud, betokening these godly Supporters of the Lord's Truth to be compassed with many hard Showers, and troublous Crosses of opprobrious Rebukes, Scorns, Slanders, Lies, and open Blasphemies. And this Cloud hideth from the World all that is in them spiritual and godly, like as it did in Christ; that to many they seem not that they are indeed.</HI>—</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Samuel Petto</HI> in his <HI>Revelation Unvaild,</HI> speaks thus, <HI>I am perswaded that most of the Vials are poured out before the Witnesses Re∣surrection.</HI> p. 93. <HI>Aaron,</HI> and <HI>Peter had their falls, their blemishes: so many pourers out of Vials, for the hardening of their Enemies, and humbling of themselves; which here I intimate once for all.</HI> p. 102.</P>
<P>To this may be added all other Evils of Affliction where-with they are made black, and as our Proverb is, are under a Cloud. Yet this Darkness is irradiated with the brightness and solace of the concomitant Rain-bow. And tho' the Storm increase and grow never so Violent; yet this Angel persists with Courage and Constancy to Proclaim the certain approach of a Fair Day.</P>
<P><HI>N.</HI> 2. <HI>And he set his Right foot upon the Sea; and his Left foot on the Earth.</HI> I humbly conceive that in the Words there is a Distri∣bution of the whole habitable Earth into the New and Old World; as if it had been said, He set his Right foot upon <HI>America;</HI> and his Left foot, on <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> If we respect the quantity, the Distribution is not very unequal: for <HI>Brerewood</HI> makes the Proportion between the New and Old World, to be as Seven
<PB N="7" REF="001647_0008_0FB3EC57EA5D0FF0"/>is to Fifteen. And <HI>America</HI> is more distinguished and separated by the Sea, from <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> than they are from each other. And in the Maps, <HI>America</HI> only and the adjacent Oceans are placed in the Right Hemisphere. In the Opinion of the Ancients, the Sea it self occupied all that space.</P>
<P>And he set his <HI>Right</HI> foot upon the <HI>Sea,</HI> but the <HI>Left</HI> upon the <HI>Earth</HI>] <HI>Id est, ad praedicandum trans Mare, et in universo orbe terrarum</HI> To Preach beyond Sea, and all the World over. Augustin, Tom. 9. Hom. 7. Col. 673. <HI>Pareus</HI> makes no question but this strong Angel is the same as <HI>Michael</HI> standing upon the Waters, and Swearing by the Living God, <HI>Daniel,</HI> 12. 7. From whence this part of the Vision seems to be taken. — Therefore this Angel is either CHRIST himself, or to be sure, an Angel representing the Person of CHRIST.</P>
<P>To <HI>Set the Foot</HI> any where, is to challenge Possession and Domi∣nion.

<P><HI>Upon the Sea</HI>] That is Maritim Provinces and Islands. <HI>Pareus,</HI> Col. 420, &amp; 425.</P>
<P><HI>Right Foot</HI>] In Military Exercises the Right foot is the foot of Motion, and Enterprise. It was infinitely profitable for the New World to be Entered upon, and Seised for CHRIST: Yet such was the indisposition and Averseness of its Inhabitants; that it behoved this strong Angel to put forth his Strength, and to Set the best foot foremost.</P>
<P>If this Interpretation prove true, there will be this Advantage by it, the Chronology of Expositions on the Revelation will be thereby Rectified. The Time of this Mighty Angel, his Setting his Right Foot on the <HI>Sea,</HI> cannot probably be earlier than the Year of our Lord GOD, One Thousand Four Hundred Ninety and Two, when <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> by his Discovery of it, brought the New World into Acquaintance with the Old.</P>
<P><HI>Lyranus</HI> makes this strong Angel to be <HI>Justin</HI> the Emperour,
<PB N="8" REF="001647_0009_0FB3EC59686C5BB0"/>whose Reign began in the Year 518. By his Imperial Power he subdued the Arrians, and restored. Orthodox Christians to their Liberty. This seams to be much out of Time. And indeed, the appearance of this Angel, the Slaughter of the Witnesses, the Drying up of Euphrates, and the Conversion of the Jews may fall in very close together. It is matter of strong Consolation to the Two Witnesses, in the prospect they have of their ap∣proaching Death, that they cannot be held long under the Power of it; and that their Death shall usher in so great and glorious a Birth. This quick and sudden Birth of the Hebrews, will make the Witnesses to forget their Sorrows; and animate them to lay by their Sack cloth, and joyfully to undertake a most illustrious Reiteration of their Prophesie.</P>
<P>And he Set his Right foot upon the Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ] <HI>Haec admirabilis statis Augeli non caret Mysterio,</HI> saith Learned <HI>Cluverus.</HI> This is mentioned three times in this short Chapter, which must be notably Significant and Characteristical. <HI>Justus Heurnius,</HI> supposeth that the Churches Planted in those Regions termed <HI>Sea,</HI> shall Excel in Glory: as the Right Foot in common acceptation excels the Left. But I had rather <HI>Heurnius</HI> should speak for himself.</P>

<P>Let not the Old World, let not Europe, let not England, let not Hampshire, let not any Shire be grieved that the Angel takes possession of the New World with his Right Foot: but rather rejoice that he keeps possession of the Old, with his Left. It would not be well taken, if <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> in their Rubbish and Ruine should envy <HI>Europe</HI> the many Ages wherein the <HI>Europeans</HI> have almost alone enjoyed the Gospel. Parents, and Tutors are freest from the torment of Envy. <HI>Europe</HI> is <HI>Columbina</HI>'s Nurse; The Noble <HI>Isabella</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> first laid her to the Brest. The <HI>English</HI> Nation have done Worthily in Settleing a considerable Revenue towards defraying part of the Charge of her Younger Sister's Schooling. Let not <HI>Europe</HI> Envy any Preferment Spoken of for her Younger Sister. T'would be most Honourable and Profitable for <HI>Europe</HI> to <HI>Strip!</HI> and Run! Run with so much Regularity, Strength, and Nimbleness, as if it were possible, to Out run <HI>Columbina!</HI></P>

<P>As to the Two Witnesses, Godly Learned Men seem to have a propensity to give their own Country the Honour of them. No less a Man than Dr. <HI>Thomas Goodwin</HI> puts in his claim for <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Only in the Witnesses of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> both the Light and Heat of Religion have been kept up and increased; and among them only hath the Profession of the Power of Godliness been con∣tinued, with difference from the Croud of Common Professors. And (according to what appears in view) more of such true Witnesses now in these last days (wherein this Slaughter is to fall out) are to be found in it, and belonging unto it, than in all the Reformed Churches besides; and that according to the Testimony which they of those Churches (who in these times of Scattering have come hither for Refuge) have, and do give. And surely, the Place of this Killing the Witnesses,
<PB N="10" REF="001647_0011_0FB3EC5C864B38A8"/>must be where most Witnesses are. And so, that Kingdom may be design'd more than any other; as in which also more eminently are found those last sort of Champions for the Beast, who receive only <HI>the Number of his Name;</HI> who yet shall be the chief Executioners of this last Slaughter.—</P>
<BIBL><HI>Goodwin,</HI> Rev. fol. 164, 165.</BIBL></Q>
<P>An anonymous French Divine, said to be Mr. <HI>Phillipot,</HI> who writ in the Year 1685. finds the Witnesses in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Peter Jurieu</HI> Expresses himself thus; <Q><HI>The bodies of the two Witnesses shall lye in the Street of the Great City.</HI> 'Tis to be observed, that in the Text, 'tis not <HI>in the Streets,</HI> in the Plural, as the <HI>French</HI> Translation reads: 'Tis <HI>in the Street,</HI> in the Singular. And I cannot hinder my self from believing, that this hath a particular regard to <HI>France,</HI> which at this day is certainly the most eminent Country which belongs to the <HI>Popish</HI> Kingdom. — And I believe, that 'tis particularly in <HI>France</HI> that the <HI>Witnesses must remain Dead,</HI> i. e. that the Profession of the <HI>True Religion</HI> must be utterly abolisht. This is already done by the Revocation of the <HI>Edict of Nantes,</HI> and by the enormous Cruelties of the <HI>Souldiers,</HI> who have been let loose upon the <HI>Protestants,</HI> of whatsoever Sex, Quality, and Condition.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Accompl. of Prophecies,</HI> p. 247, 248.</BIBL> But it must be Consider'd, The <HI>Bad</HI> must be taken with the <HI>Good.</HI> They that have the Credit of having the <HI>Witnesses,</HI> must brook the Discredit of having the <HI>Slayers of the Witnesses:</HI> For where JESUS is, there <HI>Judas</HI> must also be; that he may be Nigh, and betray with a Kiss!</P>
<P>Rev. 11. 8. <HI>The great City</HI>] I enquire whether this can be con∣veniently Understood of <HI>Rome</HI> it self, or of the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Ju∣risdiction? It seems probable, that seeing the Beast is to slay the Witnesses, they must be, and must be slain within the compass of the Beast's Jurisdiction; if they were out of it, they would not be within reach. But if the Great City so graphically described, prove to be some more peculiar and limited Jurisdiction; the In∣digitation of the Holy Ghost will appear with much more Par∣ticularity and Distinction; Persons will be directed which way to look, that they may behold this sad Spectacle. Now, may not the
<PB N="11" REF="001647_0012_0FB3EC5DF4A66C90"/>Jurisdiction of GREAT BRITAIN be this Great City? Ever since the Acts of the Parliaments which made the Union, this Juris∣diction has been Great both in <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Thing;</HI> Great in the Islands, which are the Seat of the Empire, at Home; and Great in the Islands and Continent of its Plantations, abroad. If the Elaborat Calculations of my Learned Country man Sir <HI>William Petry</HI> be Credited, <HI>LONDON,</HI> the Metropolis, is not only a Great City; but it excels in Greatness, if compar'd with <HI>Paris,</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI> And if the Regal Style in its Compleatness [GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, and IRELAND] be regarded; it will certainly be allow'd to be a Great Jurisdiction. This proposal being admitted, what is Spoken of this Great City in the 13th verse of this Chapter, will be more easily accounted for.</P>
<P>Revel. 16. 19. This <HI>Great City</HI> is generally taken to be the same that is spoken of, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11. 8. To me it seems to be mentioned as divers from great <HI>Babylon. And the Great City was divided into Three parts,</HI> [<HI>was made into three parts,</HI> as the Vulgar Latin, <HI>Stephanus,</HI> and the <HI>Rhemists</HI> Translate] <HI>and the Cities of the Nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the furceness of his Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>No Argument taken from these Words, for the Destruction of the <HI>Great City,</HI> can be cogent: they admit of a Favourable Interpreta∣tion. There are Three distinct Articles in the Verse; and to each of them a very distinct Event is assigned.</P>
<P><HI>Alcasar</HI> mentions some Expositors that take this great City, and Babylon, to be two distinct Cities. <Q>Nonnulli cum Areta <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> persuadent, non csse unam eandemque urbem; sed duas diversas, quae in versiculo assignantur. — Hanc juva<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conjecturam interpositio eorum verborum, <HI>Et civitates Gentium c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dount</HI> quae inter utramque partem sunt interjecta. Quare quod poste∣de Babylone subjungitur, non videtur connecti cum co, quod de civitate magna antecesserat. Hine fit, per civitatem magnam ab ijs in praesenti designati Ier<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solymam; quam dicu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sub mundi finem suturam esse maximam.</Q>
<BIBL>Alcasar, Rev. 16. 19. p <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</BIBL></P>
<P>As the Cities are divers, and not the same so the Dispensation
<PB N="12" REF="001647_0013_0FB3EC5F6B68D2D0"/>of Divine Providence towards them, is expressed with very re∣markable Diversity. And this Hypothesis affords help for Salving the Phaenomena of the Prophecy. However it be, To have spoken Partially for <HI>Great Britain,</HI> would have done it no good; and my self, a great deal of Hurt. I have endeavoured to speak <HI>Secundum allegata, et probata.</HI> And I most earnestly desire to be instructed, and reduced; if in any Expression I have made a deviation from the Truth. All the Grief I wish my dear Native Country, is that Recorded of the Faithful Disciples, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. XXVI. 22. (Take part of the Context together with it.)</P>
<P>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 22. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but wo unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</P>

<L>ONCE more! Our GOD, vouchsafe to Shine:</L>
<L>Tame Thou the Rigour of our Clime.</L>
<L>Make haste with thy Impartial Light,</L>
<L>And terminate this long dark Night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let the transplanted <HI>English</HI> Vine</L>
<L>Spread further still: still Call it Thine.</L>
<L>Prune it with Skill: for yield it can</L>
<L>More Fruit to Thee the Husbandman.</L>

<LG>
<L>Give the poor <HI>Indians</HI> Eyes to see</L>
<L>The Light of Life: and set them free;</L>
<L>That they Religion may profess,</L>
<L>Denying all Ungodliness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hard'ned <HI>Jews</HI> the Vail remove,</L>
<L>Let them their Martyr'd JESUS love;</L>
<L>And Homage unto Him afford,</L>
<L>Because He is their Rightfull LORD.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So false Religions shall decay,</L>
<L>And Darkness fly before bright Day</L>
<L>So Men shall GOD in CHRIST adore;</L>
<L>And worship Idols vain, no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Europa,</HI> with <HI>America;</HI></L>
<L>All Four, in Consort join'd, shall Sing</L>
<L>Now Songs of Praise to CHRIST our KING.</L>
