<HEAD>THE Negro Christianized.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a <HI>Golden Sentence,</HI> that has been sometimes quoted from <HI>Chrysostom;</HI> That <HI>for a man to know the Art of Alms, is more than for a man to be Crowned with the Dia∣dem of Kings: But to Convert one Soul unto God, is more than to pour cut Ten Thousand Talents into the Baskets of the Poor.</HI> Truly, to Raise a <HI>Soul,</HI> from a dark State of Ignorance and Wicked∣ness, to the Knowledge of GOD, and the Belief of CHRIST, and the prac∣tice of our Holy and Lovely RELI∣GION; 'Tis the noblest Work, that ever was undertaken among the Chil∣dren of men. An Opportunity to Endeavour the CONVERSION of a Soul, from a Life of <HI>Sin,</HI> which is in∣deed a woful <HI>Death,</HI> to Fear God, and Love CHRIST, and by a Religious Life to Escape the <HI>Paths of the Destroyer;</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001262_0003_0FB134FCE978E1E0"/>
it cannot but be Accptable to all that have themselves had in themselves Ex∣perience of such a <HI>Conversion.</HI> And such an Opportunity there is in your Hands, O all you that have any <HI>Ne∣groes</HI> in your Houses; an Opportu∣nity to try, Whether you may not be the Happy <HI>Instruments,</HI> of Converting, the <HI>Blackest</HI> Instances of <HI>Blindness</HI> and <HI>Baseness,</HI> into admirable <HI>Candidates</HI> of Eternal Blessedness. Let not this Op∣portunity be Lost; if you have any concern for <HI>Souls,</HI> your Own or O∣thers; but, make a Trial, Whether by your Means, the most <HI>Bruitish</HI> of Crea∣tures upon Earth may not come to be disposed, in some Degree, like the <HI>An∣gels</HI> of Heaven; and the <HI>Vassals</HI> of Sa∣tan, become the <HI>Children</HI> of God. Sup∣pose these Wretched <HI>Negroes,</HI> to be the Offspring of <HI>Cham</HI> (which yet is not so very certain,) yet let us make a Trial, Whether the CHRIST who <HI>dwelt in the Tents of Shem,</HI> have not some of His Chosen among them; Let us make a Trial, Whether they that have been Scorched and Blacken'd by the Sun of <HI>Africa,</HI> may not come to have
<PB N="3" REF="001262_0004_0FB134FE618475A8"/>
their Minds Healed by the more Benign <HI>Beams</HI> of the <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>It is come to pass by the <HI>Providence</HI> of God, without which there comes nothing to pass, that Poor <HI>Negroes</HI> are cast under your Government and Protection. You take them into your <HI>Families;</HI> you look on them as part of your <HI>Possessions;</HI> and you Expect from their Service, a Support, and perhaps an Increase, of your other <HI>Possessions.</HI> How agreeable would it be, if a Re∣ligious Master or Mistress thus atten∣ded, would now think with themselves! <HI>Who can tell but that this Poor Creature may belong to the Election of God! Who can tell, but that God may have sent this Poor Creature into my Hands, that so One of the Elect may by my means be Called; &amp; by my Instruction be made Wise unto Salva∣tion! The glorious God will put an un∣speakable Glory upon me, if it may be so!</HI> The Considerations that would move you, To Teach your <HI>Negroes</HI> the <HI>Truths</HI> of the Glorious Gospel, as far as you can, and bring them, if it may be, to Live according to those <HI>Truths,</HI> a <HI>Sober,</HI> and a <HI>Righteous,</HI> and a <HI>Godly</HI> Life: They
<PB N="4" REF="001262_0005_0FB1350025476560"/>
are <HI>Innumerable;</HI> And, if you would after a <HI>Reasonable</HI> manner consider, the Pleas which we have to make on the behalf of <HI>God,</HI> and of the <HI>Souls</HI> which He has made, one would wonder that they should not be <HI>Irresistible. Show your selves Men,</HI> and let <HI>Rational Argu∣ments</HI> have their Force upon you, to make you treat, not as <HI>Bruits</HI> but as <HI>Men,</HI> those <HI>Rational Creatures</HI> whom God has made your <HI>Servants.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P>First; The Great GOD <HI>Commands</HI> it, and <HI>Requires</HI> it of you; to do what you can that <HI>Your Servants,</HI> may also be <HI>His.</HI> It was an Admonition once given; Eph. 5.9. <HI>Masters, Know that your Master is in Heaven.</HI> You will con∣fess, That the God of Heaven is your <HI>Master.</HI> If your <HI>Negroes</HI> do not comply with your <HI>Commands,</HI> into what Anger, what Language, Perhaps into a mis∣becoming <HI>Fury,</HI> are you transported▪ But you are now to attend unto the <HI>Commands</HI> of your more Absolute <HI>Mas∣ter;</HI> and they are His <HI>Commands</HI> con∣cerning your <HI>Negroes</HI> too. What can be more Expressive; than those words
<PB N="5" REF="001262_0006_0FB135018BF61688"/>
of the Christian Law? Col. 4.1. <HI>Masters, give unto your Servants, that which is Just &amp; Equal, knowing that ye also have a Master in Heaven.</HI> Of what <HI>Servants</HI> is this Injunction to be understood? Verily, of <HI>Slaves.</HI> For <HI>Servants</HI> were generally such, at the time of Writ∣ing the New Testament Wherefore, <HI>Masters,</HI> As it is <HI>Just</HI> &amp; <HI>Equal,</HI> that your <HI>Servants</HI> be not <HI>Over-wrought,</HI> and that while they <HI>Work</HI> for you, you should <HI>Feed</HI> them, and <HI>Cloath</HI> them, and afford convenient <HI>Rest</HI> unto them, and make their Lives comfortable; So it is <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Equal,</HI> that you should Acquaint them, as far as you can, with the way to Salvation by JESUS CHRIST. You deny your <HI>Master in Heaven,</HI> if you do nothing to bring your <HI>Servants</HI> unto the Knowledge and Service of that glorious <HI>Master.</HI> One Table of the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> has this for the Sum of it; <HI>Thou shalt Love thy Neigh∣bour as thy self.</HI> Man, Thy <HI>Negro</HI> is thy <HI>Neighbour.</HI> T'were an Ignorance, un∣worthy of a <HI>Man,</HI> to imagine otherwise. Yea, if thou dost grant, <HI>That God hath made of one Blood, all Nations of men,</HI> he

is thy <HI>Brother</HI> too. Now canst thou <HI>Love</HI> thy <HI>Negro,</HI> and be willing to see him ly under the Rage of Sin, and the Wrath of God? Canst thou <HI>Love</HI> him, and yet refuse to do any thing, that his miserable Soul may be rescued from Eternal miseries? Oh! Let thy <HI>Love</HI> to that Poor <HI>Soul,</HI> appear in thy concern, to make it, if thou canst, as happy as thy own! We are Com∣manded, Gal. 6.10. <HI>As we have oppor∣tunity let us Do Good unto all men, especi∣ally unto them, who are of the Houshold of Faith.</HI> Certainly, we have <HI>Opportunity,</HI> to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto our <HI>Servants,</HI> who are of our <HI>own Houshold;</HI> certainly, we may do something to <HI>make them Good,</HI> and bring them to be of the <HI>Houshold of Faith.</HI> In a word, All the Commandments in the Bible, which bespeak our <HI>Charity</HI> to the <HI>Souls</HI> of others, and our <HI>Endeavour</HI> that the <HI>Souls</HI> of others may be delivered from the Snares of Death; every one of these do oblige us, to do what we can, for the <HI>Souls</HI> of our <HI>Negroes.</HI> They are more nearly <HI>Related</HI> unto us, than many others are; we are more fully <HI>capable</HI> to do for them, than for many others.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001262_0008_0FB13505611498F0"/>To deal yet more plainly with you; Secondly; With what Face can you call your selves <HI>Christians,</HI> if you do nothing that your <HI>Servants</HI> also may be∣come <HI>Christians?</HI> A <HI>Face</HI> that has been <HI>Baptized</HI> into the Name of the One GOD, in Three Persons, may Blush to continue unconcerned, Whether the Name of that God, be ever Known or no, in the very <HI>Families</HI> that belong unto them. Are they Worthy to be counted <HI>Christians,</HI> who are content tho' a part of their <HI>Families</HI> remain <HI>Heathen,</HI> who do <HI>not know God,</HI> nor <HI>call upon His Name?</HI> We read, 1 Tim. 5.8. <HI>If any provide not for his own, and especi∣ally those of his own house, he has denied the Faith, and is worse than an Infidel.</HI> And what is he, who does <HI>Provide</HI> no∣thing for the Souls of those whom God has made <HI>his own;</HI> that their Souls may be <HI>fed</HI> with the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> and <HI>cloath'd</HI> with the <HI>Garments of Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Heal'd</HI> of the Deadly Wounds which their Fall from God has brought up∣on them!

<HI>Infidels?</HI> Housholder, Call thy self any thing but a <HI>Christian?</HI> As for that <HI>Wor∣thy Name, — Nomen Depone,</HI> Do not pretend unto it; Thou art not <HI>Worthy</HI> of it. If thou wilt <HI>Name the Name of</HI> CHRIST, in denominating thy self a <HI>Christian,</HI> then <HI>Depart from this Iniquity,</HI> of leaving thy Servants, to continue the <HI>Servants of Iniquity.</HI> It will be found a Maxim that Fails not; That no man can Really and Heartily be of any <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> without some Desire to have that <HI>Religion</HI> Propagated. For a man to Profess a Religion, and care not a Straw, Whether any body besides him∣self be of it; certainly, That mans <HI>Profession</HI> is not worth a Straw; it can be no <HI>Sincere Profession.</HI> It is <HI>Natural</HI> for men, to promote their own Reli∣gion. Shall <HI>Christians</HI> fall short of <HI>Ma∣hometans,</HI> or of <HI>Idolaters?</HI> The Pagan <HI>Japonians,</HI> were too much in the right ont, when they concluded a certain Worldly Generation of <HI>Europaeans,</HI> to be no <HI>Christians;</HI> Because they decli∣ned <HI>the doing of any thing for the Propa∣gation of Christianity.</HI> The <HI>Christians</HI> who have no concern upon their

Minds to have <HI>Christianity Propagated,</HI> never can justify themselves. <HI>They say they are</HI> Christians, <HI>but they are not;</HI> What they are, we know not. All along the Pagans themselves, have made it the main Stroke in the Defi∣nition of, <HI>A Good Man;</HI> He is <HI>One who does all the Good that he can.</HI> The great∣est <HI>Good</HI> that we can do for any, is to bring them unto the fullest Acquain∣tance with <HI>Christianity.</HI> Will <HI>Christia∣nity</HI> allow him then to be, A <HI>Good Man,</HI> or, which is the same thing, <HI>A Christian,</HI> who refuses to do this <HI>Good,</HI> for the <HI>Servants</HI> that are under his influence? All genuine <HI>Christians</HI> are to be look'd on as the <HI>Children</HI> of the Faithful <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> who is therefore called, <HI>The Fa∣ther of the Faithful.</HI> Now of this our Father, did Heaven take it for granted; Gen. 18.19. <HI>I know him, that he will Command his Children, and his Houshold, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> He had some Hundreds of <HI>Servants</HI> be∣longing to his <HI>Houshold:</HI> He obtained, that the <HI>Slaves</HI> of his <HI>Houshold</HI> should <HI>Know</HI> the <HI>Way of the Lord;</HI> He, then <HI>Commanded,</HI> that they should <HI>Keep</HI> that

What shall we then see, but a vast company of <HI>Christian Housholders,</HI> filled with zealous contrivance and agony, to see their <HI>Houses</HI> become <HI>Christian Temples,</HI> and a glorious CHRIST wor∣shipped and obeyed by all their <HI>Hous∣holds!</HI> Yea, we read concerning some of the <HI>Primitive Christians,</HI> that with a <HI>Prodigie</HI> of <HI>Charity,</HI> they have bound themselves in the Quality of <HI>Servants,</HI> to Pagan <HI>Families,</HI> meerly that they might be in a way to <HI>Christianize</HI> the <HI>Families;</HI> And their successes were Wonderful.

about bringing to a sight of the <HI>Glory of God, in the Face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, the <HI>Folks of thy own House,</HI> upon whom thou art able to do a great deal more than upon the rest of the World? Art thou a <HI>Christian?</HI> Then thou dost <HI>Pray</HI> for thy <HI>Servants,</HI> that they may become the <HI>Servants</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the <HI>Children</HI> of God, and not <HI>fall short of entering into Rest.</HI> What! <HI>Pray</HI> for this; and yet never <HI>do</HI> any thing for it! It is impossible, or, such <HI>Praying,</HI> is but <HI>Mocking</HI> of God? Art thou a <HI>Christian?</HI> Then thou art apprehensive of a dreadful Danger, at∣tending the <HI>Souls</HI> of them who <HI>know not God and obey not His Gospel:</HI> Tis thy perswasion, <HI>That if our Gospel be hid, it is hid from them that are left;</HI> and the <HI>Ungospelized Souls</HI> are in danger of an Eternal <HI>Banishment</HI> from the <HI>Favour</HI> and the <HI>City</HI> of God. Can a <HI>Christian</HI> see his own <HI>Servants</HI> in this condition, and not be sollicitous to have them saved out of it? No; When such <HI>Christians</HI> appear before the Glorious LORD, it will be in vain for them to plead, that they call'd him LORD, and own'd

If they did it why did they not bring their <HI>Servants</HI> under the Government of the LORD? <HI>Verily,</HI> He will say to such <HI>Christians, I knew you not?</HI> Suppose that Language were heard from the mouth of a Mas∣ter concerning a Servant; <HI>If I can have the Labour of the Slave, that's all I care for: Let his Soul go and be damn'd for all me!</HI> would not every Christian say, This were Language for the Mouth of a <HI>Devil,</HI> rather than for the Mouth of a <HI>Christian!</HI> Would not every Christian cry out, <HI>Let him not be call'd a Master, but a Monster that shall speak so!</HI> Con∣sider, Syrs, whether <HI>Deeds</HI> have not a Language in them, as well as <HI>Words;</HI> a plainer Language than <HI>Words.</HI></P>

A Generous Mind cannot but entertain such senti∣ments as these: <HI>Well, what shall I do, to make this poor creature happy? What shall I do, that this poor creature may have cause, to bless God forever, for falling into my Hands!</HI> The very <HI>First Thought</HI> which will arise in a Mind thus disposed, will form a Resolution, to get these poor <HI>Negroes</HI> well instructed in <HI>the things of their Everlasting Peace;</HI> It cannot be otherwise! The State of your <HI>Negroes</HI> in this World, must be low, and mean, and abject; a State of Servitude. No <HI>Great Things</HI> in this World, can be done for them. Something then, let there be done, towards their welfare in the <HI>World to Come.</HI> Even a Papist calls up∣on us; ['tis <HI>Acosta:</HI>] <HI>Barbaris pro liber∣tate erepta fidem Jesu Christi, et vitam hominibus dignam reddamus.</HI> In the mean time, tis a most horrid and cursed <HI>Con∣dition,</HI> wherein your <HI>Servants</HI> are lan∣guishing, until <HI>Christianity</HI> has made saving impressions upon them. <HI>A roar∣ing Lion who goes about seeking whom he

<P>The way is now cleared, for the work that is proposed: that excellent WORK, <HI>The Instruction of the</HI> Negroes <HI>in the Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>A CATECHISM shall be got ready for them; first a <HI>Shorter,</HI> then a <HI>Larger;</HI> Suited at to their poor Capacities.</P>

<P>In a Plantation of many <HI>Negroes,</HI> why should not a <HI>Teacher</HI> be hired on pur∣pose, to instil into them the principles of the <HI>Catechism?</HI></P>
<P>Or, if the <HI>Overseers</HI> are once <HI>Catechised</HI> themselves, they may soon do the Office of <HI>Catechisers</HI> unto those that are under them.</P>
<P>However, Tis fit for the <HI>Master</HI> also <HI>Personally</HI> to enquire into the progress which his <HI>Negroes</HI> make in <HI>Christianity,</HI> and not leave it <HI>Entierly</HI> to the manage∣ment of others.</P>
<P>There must be <HI>Time</HI> allow'd for the <HI>Work.</HI> And why not <HI>The Lords-Day?</HI> The precept of God con∣cerning the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> is very positive; <HI>Remember the SABBATH-DAY, to keep it Holy. Thou shalt not then do any work, thou nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter,

And it is to be desired, that the <HI>Negroes</HI> may not learn to say their <HI>Catechism</HI> only by rote, like <HI>Parrots;</HI> but that their In∣structors, may put unto them such o∣ther <HI>Questions</HI> relating to the points of the <HI>Catechism,</HI> that be their <HI>Answers,</HI> (at least of YES, or NO,) it may be per∣ceived, that they Know what they Say.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="001262_0032_0FB1353711EEF528"/>But it will be also needful and use∣ful, to uphold a more particular <HI>Con∣ference</HI> often with the <HI>Negroes;</HI> and in conferring with them, to inculcate on them such <HI>Admonitions of Piety;</HI> as may have a special tendency to <HI>Form</HI> &amp; <HI>Mould</HI> their Souls for the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Having told them, <HI>Who Made</HI> them, and <HI>Why</HI> He made them, and that they have <HI>Souls,</HI> which will be <HI>Wretched</HI> or <HI>Happy</HI> forever, according as they mind <HI>Religion;</HI> then tell them;</P>
<P><HI>That by their sin against God, they are fallen into a dreadful condition.</HI></P>

<P>Tell them; <HI>That JESUS CHRIST is a Saviour for them as well as others, and as willing to save them out of their dread∣ful condition, as any others.</HI></P>
<P>Show them, That JESUS CHRIST, who is both <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> in One Person, came, and Kept the <HI>Law</HI> of God, and then

<P>Tell them; <HI>That if they Serve God patiently and cheerfully in the Condition which he orders for them, their condition will very quickly be infinitely mended, in Eternal Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>Show them, That it is GOD who has caused them to be <HI>Servants;</HI> and that they Serve JESUS CHRIST, while they are at Work for their <HI>Masters,</HI> if they are <HI>Faithful</HI> and <HI>Honest Servants,</HI> and if they do cheerful∣ly what they do, because the Lord JESUS CHRIST has bid them to do it; and that, if they give themselves up to JESUS CHRIST, and keep always afraid of Sinning against Him, it won't be <HI>Long</HI> be∣fore they shall be in a most <HI>Glorious Conditi∣on;</HI> It can't be <HI>Long</HI> before they Dy, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!</HI> they shall <HI>Rest</HI> from all their Labours, and all their Troubles, and they shall be Companions of <HI>Angels</HI> in the Glories of a <HI>Paradise.</HI></P>
