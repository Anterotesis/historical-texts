</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the Year 1651, <HI>John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes</HI> and <HI>John Crandall,</HI> called Anabaptists, were proceeded against in <HI>Boston</HI> Colony for their Faith and Practice in Religion, by Imprisoning, Fining, and Whip∣ping; <HI>Obadiah Holmes</HI> was Whipt Thirty Lashes, several of his Friends being present, among the rest <HI>John Spur</HI> and <HI>John Hazel,</HI> who as they were attending the Prisoner back to the Prison) took him by the hand in the Market-Place, and praised GOD for his Courage and Constancy, for which they were fined each of them <HI>Forty Shillings,</HI> or to be Whipt; they refused to pay the Money, but some of their Friends doing it for them they were dismissed. Which may be seen in <HI>Daniel Neals</HI> History of <HI>New-England,</HI> Vol. I. Pag. 279, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The People call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> came to <HI>Boston</HI> about five Years after, and were also proceeded against, by Imprisoning, Fining and Whipping, but in a more barbarous and cruel Manner: But these Punishments proving insufficient to keep them out of their Government: They proceeded to make many Laws, annexing many and grievous Punishments, 'till it came to cutting off Ears and Banishment upon pain of Death, and put∣ting to Death: As it is partly Recorded in <HI>Daniel Neals</HI> History of <HI>New-England,</HI> Vol. I. but more fully in <HI>George Bishop</HI>'s History of <HI>New-England</HI> Judged.</P>
<P>The Law of Banishment on pain of Death, was in these Words, (<HI>D. Neals Hist</HI> Pag. 306.)
<Q><HI>This Court doth Order and Enact,</HI> That every Person or Persons of the accursed Sect of the Quakers, which is not an Inhabitant of, but is found within this Jurisdiction, shall be apprehended

<P>Four Quakers suffered Death by this Law as followeth,</P>
<P><HI>William Robinson, Marmaduke Stephenson</HI> and <HI>Mary Dyar,</HI> coming from <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> 1659, were apprehended and Bani∣shed on pain of Death.</P>
<P>When they were Sentenced to Banishment, a Handkerchief was put into <HI>William Robinson</HI>'s Mouth, to keep them from speaking for themselves; and when he yet attempted to speak the Court in a great Rage caused him to be carried down, and Twenty cruel Stripes to be given him with a threefold corded Whip with Knots on his naked Back. They were allowed till the fourth of <HI>September</HI> to depart the Jurisdiction, the two Men went into <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and the Woman to <HI>Rhode Island.</HI> But coming again to <HI>Boston,</HI> they were all Three apprehended about the middle of <HI>October,</HI> and were demanded why they came again into the Jurisdiction being Banished on pain of Death? To which they answered severally, and declared, the ground or cause of their coming was of the LORD, and in obedience to Him; the Governor said, he desired not their Death, and that they had Liberty to speak for themselves, why they should not be proceeded with as to the giving Sentence against

them; yet he bid the Jaylor, take them away; but the next Day, after their Worship was done being heated by their Priest, they brought them before the Court again and the Governour speaking faintly, as a Man whose Life was departing, said to this effect, "We have made many Laws, and endeavoured by several Ways to keep ye from us, and neither Whipping, nor Imprisoning; nor cutting off Ears, nor Banishment upon pain of Death, will keep ye from among us" and further said, "I desire not your Death," yet presently he said, "Give ear, and hearken to your Sentence ot Death," and then made a stop, whereupon <HI>William Robinson</HI> desired that he might be suffered to read a Paper amongst them, Which was a declaration of his call to <HI>Boston,</HI> and the Reason why they stayed in the Jurisdiction after Sentence of Banishment, which the Governor denyed, and said in a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> "You shall not read it, nor will the Court hear it read."—Then <HI>William Robinson</HI> laid it on the Table a∣mongst them, and it was handed to the Governor, who read it to him∣self, and after he had done said, "<HI>William Robinson,</HI> you need not keep such an adoe to have it read, for ye spake yesterday more than here is Written,"—<HI>William Robinson</HI> said nay, and desired again it might be read, that all the People might hear the Cause of their coming, and of their stay there, and wherefore they were put to Death, but it was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suffered to be read—And the Governor said to him. <HI>Hearken to your Sentence of Death. You shall be had from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution to be hanged on the Gallows <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you are Dead.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Marmaduke Stephenson,</HI> was call'd, and the Governor said to him, <HI>If you have any thing to say you may speak,</HI> who standing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and giving no Answer, the Governor pronounced the Sentence of Death against him, saying. <HI>You shall be had to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Gallows, and there be hanged till you are dead:</HI> Which being pro∣nounced, <HI>Marmaduke Stephenson</HI> said, Give ear, ye Magistrates, and all who are guilty, for this the LORD hath said concerning you, who will perform his Word upon you, That the same Day ye put his Servants to Death, shall the Day of your Visitation pass over your Heads, and you shall be cursed forevermore: The Mouth of the LORD of Hosts hath spoken it, therefore in Love to you all, I exhort you to take Warning, before it be too late, that so the Curse may be removed, for assuredly, if you put us to Death, you'll bring innocent Blood upon your own Heads, and swift Destruction will come upon you.—After he had spoken this he was had to Prison.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> was called, and the Governor said to her to this Effect,—<HI>Mary Dyar, You shall go to the Place from whence
<PB N="4" REF="008085_0004_102E26424C24B038"/>
you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and be hanged there until you are dead.</HI>—To which she replied, the Will of the LORD be done: The Governor said, <HI>Take her away Marshal:</HI> She answered, Yea, Joyfully shall I go.—They were all kept in Prison while the <HI>Twenty-seventh</HI> of the same Month; and after their Worship was done, their Drums were beat, and these Three were taken out of Prison, who parted from their Friends in Prison full of the Joy of the LORD, who had counted them worthy to suffer for his Name; and having embraced each other in fervency of Love, and gladness of Heart, and peace with GOD, like innocent Lambs:—The Captain with his band of Men lead them to the Place of Execution, and caused the Drums to beat when they attempted to speak, and placed them near the Drums for that purpose, that when they spake the People might not hear them, who in great Multitudes flocked about them; his Drums he would not cease Beating, though he was desired while they were speaking, which (<HI>George Bishop</HI> saith) <HI>was a barbarous Inhumanity never heard of before in the English Nation;</HI>—<HI>William Robinson</HI> went chearfully up the Ladder to the very top above the Gallows, and spake to the People, that they suffered not as evil doers, but as those who testified and manifested the Truth, and this was the Day of their Visitation, and therefore desired them to mind the Light that was in them, the Light of CHRIST of which he testi∣fied, and was now going to seal it with his Blood.—The Executioner put <HI>William Robinson</HI> to Death, and after him <HI>Marma∣duke Stephenson,</HI> who died both of them full of the joy of the LORD, and steadfast in Him. The Officers were so Barbarous that when their dead Bodies were cut down they fell to the Ground, with which the Skull of <HI>W. Robinson</HI> was broke, his Body being stiff'ere it was cut down, their Shirts were ripped off with a Knife, and their naked Bodies cast into a Hole of the Earth, which was digged without any covering; and when some Friends came, and desired their Bodies to be put in Cof∣fins, the Executioner suffered them to wrap them in Linnen, and to put them into the Hole again, but to take them away he suffered them not, saying, <HI>he was strictly charged to the contrary.</HI></P>
<P>Their Priest <HI>Wilson,</HI> made a Ballad of these Martyrs.</P>
<P>As the People returned from the Executions of these Martyrs, a Draw-Bridge rose up &amp; the one end of it fell upon many, &amp; some were hurt, especially a wicked Woman who reviled the Servants of the LORD at their death, whom it greatly bruised, and her flesh Rotted from her bones; and her stink was so noisom that People could hardly come at her; in which miserable Condition she died.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="008085_0005_102E264420E28888"/>Three also of Priest <HI>Wilson's</HI> Grand-Children died in a short Time after.</P>

<HEAD><HI>William Robinson</HI>'s Paper to the Court, before he was sentenced to death, concerning the Cause of their coming into those Parts, for which they were put to death, which the Governor in a great Fury said, <HI>should not be read, and that the Court would not hear it.</HI> Which was in these Words:</HEAD>
<P>ON the 8th Day of the 8th Month, 1659. in the after part of the Day, in Traveling betwixt <HI>Newport</HI> in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> and <HI>Daniel Gold</HI>'s House, with my dear Brother, <HI>Christopher Holder,</HI> The Word of the Lord came expresly to me, which did fill me immediately with Life and Power, and heavenly Love, by which he constrained me, and com∣manded me to pass to the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> my Life to lay down in his Will, for the accomplishing of his Service, that he had there to perform at the day appointed. To which heavenly Voice I presently yielded Obedience, not questioning the Lord how he would bring the Thing to pass, being I was a Child, and Obedience was demanded of me by the Lord, who filled me with living Strength and Power from his heavenly Presence, which at that Time did mightily overshadow me, and my Life at that Time did say, Amen, to what the Lord required of me, and had commanded me to do, and willingly was I given up from that Time, to this Day, the Will of the Lord to do and per∣form, whatever became of my Body: For, the Lord had said unto me. <HI>My Soul shall rest in everlasting Peace, and my Life shall enter into Rest, for being obedient to the God of my Life.</HI> I being a Child, and durst not question the Lord in the least, but rather willing to lay down my Life, than to bring Dishonor to the Lord: And as the Lord made me willing, dealing gently and kindly with me, as a tender Father by a faithful Child whom he dearly loves, so the Lord did deal with me in ministring his Life unto me, which gave and gives me Strength to perform what the Lord requires of me; and still as I did and do stand in Need, he ministred and ministreth more Strength, and Virtue, and heavenly Power and Wisdom, whereby I was and am made strong in God, not fearing what Man shall be suffered to do unto me: Being filled with heavenly Courage, which is Meekness and Innocency, for the Cause is the Lord's that we go in, and the Battle

is the Lord's; and thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the mighty and the terrible GOD, <HI>Not by Strength nor by Might, nor by Power of Man, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts, I will perform what my Mouth hath spoken, through my Servants whom I have chosen, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth.</HI> Friends, the God of my Lite, and the God of the whole Earth, did lay this Thing upon me, for which I now suffer Bonds near unto Death: He by his a mighty Power, and everlasting Love, constrained me, and laid this Thing upon me; and truly I could not deny the Lord, much less resist the Holy One of <HI>Israel.</HI> Therefore all who are ignorant of the Motion of the Lord in the inward Parts, be not hasty in judging in this Matter, lest ye speak evil of the Things ye know not: For, of a Truth, the Lord God of Heaven and Earth commanded me by his Spirit, and spake unto me by his Son, whom he hath made Heir of all Things, and in his Life I live, and in it I shall depart this Earthly Tabernacle, if unmerciful Men be suffered to take it from me. And, herein I rejoice, that the Lord is with me, the ancient of Days, the Life of the suffering Seed, for which I am freely given up, and singly do I stand in the Will of God; for to me to live is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and to die is Gain; and truly I have a great Desire and Will to die herein, knowing that the Lord is with me, whatever ignorant Men shall be able to say against me; for the Witness of the Spirit I have received, and the Presence of the Lord, and his heavenly Life doth accompany me, so that I can say in Truth, and from an upright Heart, <HI>Blessed be the Lord God of my Life, who hath counted me worthy, and called me hereunto, to bear my Testimony against ungodly and unrigh∣teous Men, who seek to take away the Life of the Righteous without a Cause, as the Rulers of</HI> Massachusetts-bay <HI>do intend, if the Lord stop them not from their intent.</HI> Oh! hear ye Rulers, and give Ear and listen all ye that have any Hand herein, to put the Innocent to Death: For, in tne Name, and Fear, and Dread of the Lord God, I here declare the Cause of my staying here among you, and con∣tinuing in the Jurisdiction after there was a Sentence of Banishment upon Death, as ye said, pronounced against me without a just Cause, as ye all know that we that were banished, committed nothing worthy of Banishment, nor of any Punishment, much less Banishment upon Death. And now ye Rulers, ye do intend to put me to Death, and my Companion, unto whom the Word of the Lord God came, saying, <HI>Go to Boston with thy Brother W.

Well, if ye do this Act, and put us to Death, Know this, and be it known unto you all, ye Rulers and People within this Jurisdiction, <HI>That whosoever hath a Hand herein, will be guilty of innocent Blood, And not only upon your Selves will ye bring innocent Blood, but upon the Town and the Inhabitants thereof, and every where within your Jurisdiction, that had the least Hand therein.</HI> Therefore be instructed, ye Rulers of this Land, and take Warning betimes, and learn Wisdom before it be hid from your Eyes.</P>

So, my dear Brethren and Sisters, my Love and Life feel in your own Hearts, for I am full unto you all in heavenly Love, and my Life is ever with you: The Lord forever keep us all, as we are now, to the Glory of his Name, <HI>Amen.</HI> This was I moved to write unto you all, my dear Brethren and Sisters, my fellow Prisoners, that have any Part, or do partake with me herein.

<HEAD><HI>Marmaduke Stephenson</HI>'s Paper of his Call to the Work and Service of the Lord. Given forth by him a little before he was put to Death, and after he had received his Sentence.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Beginning of the Year 1655, I was at the Plough in the East Parts of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> in <HI>Old-England,</HI> near the Place where
<PB N="9" REF="008085_0009_102E264B41120C40"/>
my out-ward Being was, and as I walked after the Plough, I was filled with the Love and Presence of the living God, which did ravish my Heart when I felt is: for it did increase and abound in me like a living Stream, so did the love and life of God run thorough me like precious Ointment, giving a pleasant Smell, which made me to stand still; and as I stood a little still with my Heart and Mind stayed on the Lord, the Word of the Lord came to me in a still small Voice, which I did hear perfectly, saying to me, in the secret of my Heart and Conscience,—<HI>I have Ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations.</HI>—And at the beginning of the Word of the Lord, I was put to a stand, being that I was but a Child for such a weighty Matter. So at the Time appointed, <HI>Barbados</HI> was set before me, until which I was required of the Lord to go, and leave my dear and loving Wife, and tender Children: For the Lord said unto me immediately by his Spirit, That he would be as a Husband to my Wife, and as a Father to my Children, and they should not want in my Absence, for he would provide for them when I was gone And I believed that the Lord would perform what he had spoken, because I was made willing to give up my self to his Work and Service, to leave all, and follow him, whose Presence and Life is with me, where I rest in Peace and Quietness of Spirit (with my dear Brother) under the shadow of his Wings, who hath made us willing to lay down our Lives for his own Name sake, if unmerciful Man be suffered to take them from us; and if they do, we know we shall have Peace and rest with the Lord for ever in his holy Habitation, when they shall have Torment Night and Day. So, in Obedience to the living God, I made preparation to pass to <HI>Barbados</HI> in the 4th Month. 1658. So, after some time, I had been on the said Island in the service of God, I heard that <HI>New-England</HI> had made a Law to put the Servants of the living God to Death, if they returned after they were sentenced away, which did come near me at that Time; and as I considered the Thing, and pondered it in my Heart immediately came the Word of the Lord unto me, saying, <HI>Thou knowest not but that thou mayest go thither</HI>—But I kept this Word in my Heart and did not declare it to any, until the Time appointed. So, after that, a Vessel was made ready for <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> which I passed in. So, after a little Time that I had been there, visi∣ting the Seed which the Lord hath blessed, the Word of the Lord came unto me saying. <HI>Go to Boston with thy Brother William Robinson.</HI>—And at his Command I was obedient, and gave up myself
<PB N="10" REF="008085_0010_102E264CD17D3BE0"/>

<P>WHereas I am by many charged with the Guiltiness of my own Blood; if you mean in my coming to <HI>Boston,</HI> I am therein clear, and justified by the Lord, in whose Will I came, who will require my Blood of you, be sure, who have made a Law to take away the Lives of the innocent servants of God, if they come among you, who are called by you, <HI>Cursed Quakers;</HI> although I say, and am a living Witness for them and the Lord, that he hath blessed them, and sent them unto you: Therefore be not found Fighters against God, but let my Counsel and Request be accepted with you, To repeal all such Laws, that the Truth and Servants of the Lord may have free Passage among you, and you be kept from shedding innocent Blood, which I know there are many among you would not do, if they knew it so to be: Nor can the Enemy that stirreth you up thus to destroy this holy Seed, in any Measure countervail the great Dam∣age that you will by thus doing procure: Therefore, seeing the Lord hath not hid it from me, it lyeth upon me, in Love to your Souls, thus to persuade you: I have no self-ends, the Lord knoweth, for if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two Years; and now it is like to encrease, even unto Death, for no evil Doing, but com∣ming among you.

<P><HI>WIlliam Leddra,</HI> having been several Times cruelly whipt, and en∣dures fore and long Imprisonments in <HI>Boston,</HI> was also sentenced unto Banishment upon Pain of Death; and he coming again to <HI>Boston</HI> to visit his Friends in Prison, was soon laid hold of and thrust into Prison and there kept Night and Day, locked in Chains, during a cold Winter, and in the first Month, 1660 1, being brought before the Court, was told, <HI>That he was found guilty, and that he was to die:</HI> William said, <HI>What evil have I done?</HI> they said, <HI>his own Con∣fession was as good as a thousand Witnesses:</HI> William demanded, <HI>What was that?</HI> They answered, <HI>That he owned those that were put to Death, and that he would not put off his Hatt in Court, and that he would say thee and thou:</HI> Then said William, <HI>You will put me to Death for speaking English, and for not putting off my Cloaths</HI> One replied, <HI>A man may speak Treason in English. Let us come to the Thing in Hand then</HI> answered William, <HI>Is it Treason to say Thee and Thou, to a single Person?</HI> To which none replied. But one demanded. <HI>Whe∣ther he would go for England?</HI> William answered, <HI>I have no Business there. Then,</HI> said one of them, pointing to the Gallows, <HI>you shall be hanged or he should go that Way.</HI> William replied, <HI>What will ye put me to Death, for breathing in the Air of your Jurisdiction i— And for what you have against me, I appeal to the Laws of England</HI> (said he) <HI>for my Trial, and if by them I am guilty, I refuse not to die</HI>—To this they would not agree; but sought to persuade him to recant of those errors, and to conform, and submit; to which he an∣swered,
<PB N="14" REF="008085_0014_102E2657C079C7C8"/>
<HI>What, to join with such Murderers as you are? then let every Man that meets me say,—Lo, this is the Man that hath forsaken the Goa of his Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>At the last. General Court he had Liberty given him to go for En∣gland, or to go out of that Jurisdiction; and promising so to do and come there no more, he might save his Life. He answered, <HI>I stand not in mine own Will, but in the Will of the Lord; if I may have my Freedom, I shall go, but to make you a Promise I cannot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Leddra</HI> was sentenced to Death, and returned to Prison in order to Execution; and on the 14th of the same Month, after their Lecture was ended, the Governor came, and a Guard of Soldiers to the Prison; and <HI>William</HI> having taken his Farewel of <HI>Wenlock Christi∣son,</HI> his Fellow Prisoner, and the rest of his Friends then in Bonds for the same Testimony, went forth to the Slaughter, willingly re∣signed up to the Will of the Lord, whom the Guard encompassed round, to prevent his Speech with Friends, or his speaking with any; which <HI>Edward Wharton</HI> perceiving, and how the Guard strove to pre∣vent his speaking with <HI>William,</HI> he said, <HI>Friends, what will you shew your selves worse than bloody Bonner's Brood? What, will you not let me come near my Friend, before you kill him? Chl</HI> said one, <HI>Edward, it will be your Turn next.</HI> The Captain said, <HI>If you speak a Word, I will stop your Mouth</HI> He was brought to the Gallows, and his Arms pinioned; where he took Leave of his Friend <HI>Edward Wharton</HI> as he was about to ascend the Ladder, to whom he said, <HI>All that will be Christ's Disciples, must take up the Cross.</HI> And standing where the Guard ordered him, with an exceeding fresh and lively Countenance, he spake to the People, and said, <HI>For bearing my Testimony for the Lord, against Deceivers, and the deceived, am I brought here to suffer.</HI></P>
<P>There was present one Thomas Wilkie, a Stranger, having heard in the Town, that William might go away if he would, and being moved with pity, believing he was Innocent; he cried aloud, begging that his Life might be spared, and also called, to William, to come down from the Gallows, saying, <HI>You may go away if you will;</HI> but the Captain said, <HI>It is no such Matter;</HI> and William looked upon him, and said, <HI>Friend, know that this Day I am willing to offer up my Life, for the witness of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>As they were putting the Halter about his Neck, he said, <HI>I commit my righteous Cause unto thee, O God.</HI> And as the Ladder was turning off, he cried, <HI>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>William Leddra being dead, his Body was cut down and E. Wharton,

and three Friends more, catched it in their Arms, and laid it on the Ground, until the Executioner had stripped it of the Cloaths, and they were suffered to lay it in a Coffin, and bury it where they thought mere, which it is like the Out-cry of the Country led unto, because of the Ex∣ecutioner's drawing the Bodies of William Robinson, and Marmaduke Stevenson, very barbarously by the Legs, into the Hole that was digged for them, after their Shirts were ripped off.</P>
<P>While William Leddra was suffering Death, Wenlock Christison was brought before the Judgment Seat, the Governor and Deputy-Governor being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present, they said to him, <HI>Except you will renounce your Reli∣gion, you shall surely die.</HI> Wenlock (being nothing affrighted) said, <HI>Nay, I shall not change my Religion, nor seek to save my Life; neither do I intend to deny my Master; but if I lose my Life for Christ's Sake, and the Preaching of the Gospel, I shall save it.</HI> And after a few more Words he was sent to Prison again, there to be kept till the next Court.— The Court being sitting in the 3d and 4th Months, 1661, a Spirit of Confusion was mingled amongst them, so that they were in a Manner broken;—the sense of the innocent Blood spilt, and the Consequences thereof being so weighty on some of them, that they could not consent to the putting of this Man to Death; insomuch that the Governor <HI>(John Endicot)</HI> was wrath, and went away from the Court discontented, and kept from it the Space of two Days, but he was prevailed with at length to come, they having assured him that if he would, they would proceed against Wenlock according to their Law: So, they being agreed, before the Judgment Seat Wenlock was brought; the Governor asked him, <HI>What he had to say for himself, why he might not Die? —I have done nothing worthy of Death,</HI> replied Wenlock, <HI>if I had, I refuse not to die. Thou art come in amongst us,</HI> said one, <HI>in Rebellion, which is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and ought to be punished</HI> — <HI>I came not in Rebellion,</HI> said Wenlock, <HI>but in Obedience to the God of Heaven, not in Contempt to any of you, but in Love to your Souls and Bodies, and that you shall know one Day, when you and all Men, shall give Account of the deeds done in the Body. Take heed,</HI> said he, <HI>for you cannot escape the righteous Judgments of God.</HI></P>
<P>Then said their Major-General Adderton, <HI>You pronounce Woes and Judgments, and those that are gone before you pronounced Woes and Judgments, but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon us yet. — Be not proud,</HI> replied Wenlock, <HI>neither let your Spirits be lifted up. God doth but wait till the Measure of your Iniquity be filled up and that you have run your ungodly Race, then will the Wrath of God come upon you to the uttermost: — And as for thy Part, it hangs over thy Head, and is near to be poured down upon then, and shall come as a Thief in the Night, suddenly, when thou thinkest not of it.</HI></P>

<P><HI>By what Law,</HI> said Wenlock, <HI>will ye put me to Death?</HI> They replied, <HI>We have a Law, and by our Law you are to die So laid the Jews of Christ,</HI> replied Wenlock; <HI>Who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you</HI> said he, <HI>to make that Law?</HI> One of them said, <HI>We have a Patent, and are Patentees, judge whether we have not Power to make Laws.</HI> Wenlock replied again. <HI>How, have you Power to make Laws repugnant to the Laws of England? Nay,</HI> said their Governor. <HI>Then,</HI> answered Wenlock, <HI>you are gone beyond your Bounds, and have forfeited your Patent, and this is more than you can answer.</HI> But they owning themselves the King's Subjects, Wenlock said, <HI>So am I, and for any Thing I know, am as good as you if not better</HI> and therefore, seeing they and he were Subjects to the King, he demanded to be tried by the Laws of his own Nation; and also said, <HI>I never heard nor read of any Law in England to hang Quakers.</HI> The Governor replied. <HI>There was a Law in England to hang Jesuits.</HI> Wenlock answered. <HI>If you put me to Death, it is not because I go under the Name of a Jesuit, but a Quaker, therefore,</HI> said he, <HI>I do appeal to the Laws of my own Nation.</HI> But the Court proceeded to try him, and he was brought in guilty; whereupon the Secretary said. <HI>Wenlock Christison, hold up your Hand. I will not</HI> said Wenlock; <HI>I am here, and can hear thee.</HI> Then he cried, <HI>Guilty, or not Guilty? I deny all Guilt,</HI> replied Wenlock, <HI>for my Conscience is clear in the Sight of God,</HI> The Governor answered, <HI>The Jury hath condemned thee.</HI> But he an∣swered, <HI>The Lord doth justify me; who art thou that condemnest?</HI> Then they voted as to the Sentence of Death, and were in a Manner confoun∣ded, for several could not vote him guilty of Death. Then said the Governor, <HI>I could find it in my Heart to go Home,</HI> being in a Rage, Wen∣lock cried. <HI>It were better for thee to be at Home than here, for thou art about a bloody Piece of Work</HI> Whereupon the Governor put the Court to vote again, which they did, notwithstanding there were some that would not consent. But the Governor stood up and said, <HI>You that will not consent, record it</HI> And like a Man drunk, he said, <HI>I thank God I am not afraid to give Judgment. Wenlock bristison, hearken to your Sentence, You must return to the Place from whence you came and from thence to the Place of Execution and there you must be hanged until you be dead, dead, dead</HI> Wenlock Christison called out and said, <HI>The Will of the Lord he done, in whose Will I came amongst you, and in his Council I stand, feeling

his eternal Power, that will uphold me until the last Gasp, I do not question it. Moreover</HI> he cried saying, <HI>known be it unto you all, that if you have Power to take my Life from me, that my Soul shall enter into ever∣lasting Rest and Peace with God, where you yourselves shall never come, and if you have Power to take my Life from me, the which I do Question; I do believe you shall never more take Quakers Lives from them (note my Words) do not think to weary out the living God, by taking away the Lives of his Servants. What do you gain by it? For the last Man that you put to Death, here are Five come in his Room: And if you have Power to take my Life from me, God can raise up the same Principle of Life, in Ten of his Servants, and send them among you, in my Room; that you may have Torment upon Torment, which is your Portion; for there is no Peace to the Wicked, saith my God.</HI> Then the Governor said, <HI>take him away to Prison.</HI>—Where he rested in Peace, and quietness of Spirit.—But within a Week after, came a Marshal, and Constable to him in the Prison, with an Order from the Court, for his, and other Friends enlargement; who said, <HI>they were ordered by the Court, to make them acquainted with their new Law.</HI>— Then <HI>Wenlock</HI> said, <HI>what means this? have you a new Law? Yes,</HI> said they, <HI>then you have deceived most People,</HI> said Wenlock; <HI>why said they? because,</HI> said Wen∣lock, <HI>they did think the Gallaws had been your last Weapon; have you got more yet? Yes</HI> said they, <HI>Read it,</HI> said he; which they did. Then said Wenlock, <HI>Your Magistrates said, your Law was a good and whole∣some Law made for the Peace and Safeguard of your Country: What, are your Hands now become Weak? the Power of God is over you all.</HI> Then the Prison Doors were set open, and Twenty seven more besides <HI>Wenlock,</HI> were turned forth; whereof two were stripped to the Waste, and made, fast to Carts-tails, and Whipped through the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> with Twenty cruel Stripes, on their naked Backs and Shoulders; so into the Wilderness they were driven, by Sword and Club men, out of that Jurisdiction. <HI>Glory, Glory be given to the Lord, over all</HI> saith my Soul, <HI>who never leaves nor forsakes the Righteous, but redeems his faithful Ones out of all their Trouble; Praise the Lord all his Saints who are upon the Rock of Ages; And the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against you,</HI> saith Wenlock Christison.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Wharton▪</HI> who was often cruelly Whipped, and Persecuted other Ways, was also taken from his own House in <HI>Salem,</HI> and carried to <HI>Boston,</HI> and after he had been kept close Prisoner almost a Year, was (the 11th of the 1st Month, 1660.) Banished on pain of Death, to depart the Jurisdiction in Ten Days. He replied, <HI>Friends,

I have Dealings with some People, it were good for me to have Time to make clear with all; and then, if you have Power to Murder me you may.</HI> The Governor said, <HI>If we give him an Hundred Days it is all one. Edward</HI> replied, <HI>I shall not go away; therefore be careful what you do.</HI>—And he afterwards wrote to them, signifying, where∣as they had banished him on Pain of Death, he was yet at home, at his House in <HI>Salem,</HI> and could not go away, and therefore inti∣mated to them to take off their wicked Sentence, from him, that he might go about his Occasions out of their Jurisdiction. <HI>John Cham∣berlain</HI> and <HI>Robert Harper,</HI> and others, were also banished on Pain of Death.</P>
<P>A Letter was sent from the King to the Rulers of <HI>New-England,</HI> dated the 9th Day of <HI>September,</HI> 1661, by which they were inquired to put no more Quakers to Death. But <HI>George Bishop</HI> gives Account in his Book, that they were continually whipped, imprisoned, and their Goods spoiled, in a wonderful, barbarous, and cruel Manner, expo∣sed to much Cold and Hardship in their Persecutions, sometimes their Food was kept from them in Prison, and none suffered to come at them, and not suffered to have Food for their Money, the Mini∣sters stirring up the Authority to persecute and drive them away; so that in about seven Years, they suffered more than one Hundred and Sixty Whippings, most of them very cruelly laid on; one of them, <HI>Anne Coleman,</HI> being whipt almost to Death. <HI>G. Bishop, pag,</HI> 430. —Of which I shall relate one Passage concerning <HI>Elisabeth Hocton,</HI> an ancient Woman, who came from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>New-England,</HI> and went about visiting in a godly Manner, and was many Times whipped, and cruelly used for her Pains.</P>
<P>She crying, <HI>Repentance,</HI> through Part of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> was by two Magistrates committed, whose Jailor thrust her into a noisome, stink∣ing Dungeon, where there was nothing to lye on, or sit on, and kept her there two Days and two Nights, without helping her to Bread or Water; and because <HI>Benanuel Bower,</HI> a tender hearted Friend, brought her a little Milk in this her great Distress, (wherein she had like to have perished) they cast him into Prison, for entertaining a Stranger, and fined him Five Pounds. After this cruel Usage, and her lying two Days and two Nights in this dismal Cell, she was had to Court, and ordered to be sent out of their Coasts towards <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> and to be Whipped at three Towns, ten Stripes at each, by the Way: So, at <HI>Cambrdige</HI> she was tied to the Whipping Post, and lashed with ten cruel Stripes, with a three-stringed Whip, with three

Knots at an End; and at <HI>Watertown</HI> she was laid on with ten Stripes more, of Rods of Willows; and at <HI>Dedham,</HI> in a cold frosty Morn∣ing they laid on her aged Limbs ten Lashes more, with exceeding Cru∣elty, at a Cart's Tail.</P>
<P>Her Skin and Flesh being thus torn and beaten with the afore∣said Extremities, they put her on Horse back, and carried her a weary Journey many Miles into the Wilderness, and towards Night left her there, where many Wolves and Bears, and wild Beasts used sometimes to set upon living Persons, and many deep Water's to pass through, and then, as themselves said, they thought they should see her no more.</P>
<P>But the Lord so preserved her through the Waters, many of which she passed through with the Peril of her Life, and all other the ex∣treme Inconveniencies of that her Condition, led her through, and up held her weak, bruised Body, and brought her the next Morning to Town called <HI>Reboboth,</HI> being neither weary nor faint, and then to <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> to Friends, where she was refreshed, and gave Glory to the Lord who had counted her worthy, and enabled her to suffer for his Name, beyond what her Age and Sex could otherwise reasonably have born.

<HEAD>Concerning the Difference between the former Quakers, that suffered Persecu∣tions, and these in this Day.</HEAD>
<P>IF we may know them by their Fruits, they were two Manner of People, the first often going to Meeting Houses, and bearing a godly Testimo∣ny after the Speaker had done, also teaching and exhorting at other public Places, for which they suffered much Persecution, which they took joyfully, being upheld by the Power of God. And these, only holding Meetings of their own in a formal way, as other Professors do, having a form of God∣liness and not the Power and Life thereof, as the suffering Quakers had; minding earthly Things, being adulterated and living in the Friendship of the World, which is Enmity with God. <HI>Jam</HI> 4.4. So these not having the Spirit as the first Quakers had, are no more to be compared with them, than a dead Tree may be compared to a living Tree.</P>
