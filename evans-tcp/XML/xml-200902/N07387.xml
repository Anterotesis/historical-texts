<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are Thousands in the World, of such a dull, stupid, morose, and sullen Turn of Mind, as to think every Thing that wears not the Face of De∣jection, dissolute; and who decry the most innocent Chearfulness as criminal.</P>
<P>As Liquors tinge the containing Vessel, the Severity of these Mens Complexion gives a Gloom to Religion, which is paint∣ed by them, as wearing a continual Frown, and with Features inflexible to any Sort of Chearfulness: And though the Reason of Things, the Methods of Providence, the Order of the World, and the Scriptures
<PB N="4" REF="009424_0004_0F743BCE324B4268"/>
themselves, are unitedly against this sour and surly Stoicism, yet such is the perverse Turn of Mind of these Men, that instead of lay∣ing hold with Rapture on such Methods as are offer'd for their better Information, they have as obstinately set themselves down to cavil at them, as if instead of the utmost Benefit, the highest Injury had been offer'd, and Outrage committed against them.</P>
<P>MANY, actuated by this perverse Turn of Mind, in other Respects of strong Abili∣ties, have been vainly and impiously tempt∣ed to murther their Time in traversing the Bible merely to pick out Texts and Portions of it in Support of their contracted No∣tions; when, after all, they have done No∣thing to their Purpose, but like the hungry peevish Viper in the Fable, broke their Teeth upon a File that mocked their idle Frenzy.</P>
<P>THIS fills the Minds of such as are con∣nected with them in Society, and who fall into the Snare, with unfavourable Senti∣ments towards their Fellow-Citizens; wrong Ideas of Persons and Things they are not acquainted with; and uncharitable Inter∣pretations of those Actions of which they
<PB N="5" REF="009424_0005_0F743BCEF1715D28"/>
are by no Means competent Judges: It in∣stils into their Minds the utmost Violence and Bitterness, and eradicates that Charity and Brotherly-love, which is the Ornament and Perfection of Religion, and the most indispensable Means for attaining the End of it.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE that excellent Writer, Arch∣bishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> observes, <Q>That it will be hard to determine how many Degrees of Innocency and Good-nature, or of Cold∣ness and Indifferency in Religion, are necessary to overbalance the Fury and Mischiefs of a blind Zeal.</Q></P>
<P>BISHOP <HI>Gibson</HI> also, speaking of the fatal Consequences of <HI>Bigotry,</HI> has this excellent Observation;—speaking of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he says, <Q>The more they failed in the inward Obedience of the Heart, and the Duties of moral Goodness and Righteousness, the greater Zeal they shew'd for the outward and ritual Parts of the Law.</Q></P>
<P>TRUE Devotion languishes, while the Mind is divided and taken up with Con∣troversies and Debates concerning Ceremo∣nies, which in themselves cannot be said to
<PB N="6" REF="009424_0006_0F743BCFCDA973A8"/>
be essential to Religion, but mostly prove prejudicial to it, by occasioning weak Minds to set too high a Value on them, and to mistake the Shadow for the Substance.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Expedients, therefore, can be found to allay these Animosities, which break us into different Factions and Interests, cannot but be useful to Religion in general, and highly tend to its Reputation and In∣crease among Men.</P>
<P>AND certain I am, that were the Clergy of all Denominations, obliged to preach up the Necessity of Brotherly-love, and prohi∣bited from using Invectives against those who differ from them in the ceremonial Forms of Devotion, the Face of Religion, through∣out the Land, would wear a different As∣pect; nor would Men have less Love for each other because of their Difference in the Modes of Worship: But while the Churches are daily pronouncing their horrid and blas∣phemous Anathemas against those of diffe∣rent Communities, the deluded Flock, who look on themselves as of the Houshold of GOD, are taught to regard and hate those of other Persuasions, as of the Houshold of the Devil.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009424_0007_0F743BD16C4F1038"/>THIS is a Fact of the greatest Notoriety; all Men know it, and none will deny it: Instead of multiplying these desirable Op∣portunities, where we may agree in Points of publick Worship, that are indifferent in themselves, we let the Spirit of Contention into those very Methods that are not only foreign to vital Religion, but should in their Nature dispose us to be Friends: This our Anger in our Devotion, is like Poison in Perfume, which taints the Spi∣rits, instead of chearing and refreshing them.</P>
<P>THIS unhappily being the Case, I shall not wonder if the Attempt I am making to∣wards introducing the Use of Instrumental Musick into the Worship of those Societies who have hitherto been taught to look up∣on such as unlawful, and unscriptural, should be attended with the same Opposition with the Promulgation of the Gospel itself, and the Promoter of it exposed to the same Bigotry and misguided Zeal. However, as every well-meant Attempt deserves Appro∣bation and Encouragement, I shall venture to lay my Thoughts on this Subject before the Publick; which, though they may be far short of the End propos'd, may yet per∣haps
<PB N="8" REF="009424_0008_0F743BD23A286998"/>
have the Merit of suggesting some Hints to others who may be Lovers of the divine Harmony I am contending for, and better qualified to make the Attempt.</P>
<P>HAVING thus briefly premised the fatal Tendency of a blind misguided Zeal, and shewed that it is not only destructive of So∣ciety, but a Bar to the Advancement of Re∣ligion in the World, I shall now proceed to note the Origin of Instrumental Musick; the <HI>Lawfulness of using such in divine Wor∣ship;</HI> and that it has been held <HI>so</HI> by <HI>the far greater Part</HI> of the Professors of Christianity in all Ages of the World, even down to the present Time.</P>
<P>As the Scriptures are universally acknow∣ledged to be given by the Inspiration of GOD, the most probable Way to strengthen my Argument, and remove the Prejudices of such as are dispos'd to cavil at the Institu∣tion I am recommending, will be to take my Measures of it occasionally, from those who were immediately directed and assisted in it by the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>AND first, with regard to the Origin of Vocal and Instrumental Musick, they were
<PB N="9" REF="009424_0009_0F743BD2AFE27410"/>
doubtless among the most early Inventions of the Sons of Men: <HI>Moses</HI> particularly tells us, <HI>Genesis</HI> iv. 21, that <HI>Jubal,</HI> long before the Flood, followed the making such musi∣cal Instruments as were then used in the Worship of GOD, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Harp</HI> and OR∣GAN, as a Trade: And with regard to Vo∣cal Musick, we are told, <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii, that when the ALMIGHTY had laid the Foun∣dations of the Earth, <Q>the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of GOD shouted for Joy.</Q></P>
<P>"IF, says a late Writer, we look back to the Records of Antiquity, we shall find that some of the oldest and most exalted Com∣positions of Men, are Songs of Praise and Extasy to their GREAT CREATOR.</P>
<P>THERE is something in <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Mu∣sick</HI> admirably suited to divine Subjects; and it is natural for the Soul, when struck with any Thing surprizingly <HI>great, good</HI> or <HI>new,</HI> to break forth, beyond the common Modes of Speech, into the most rapturous Turns of Expression; accompanied with correspondent Attitudes of Body and Modu∣lations of Voice. Even the untutored Sa∣vages around us, furnish striking Examples of this.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009424_0010_0F743BD4DBB3D3D0"/>HENCE it is, that <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Musick</HI> were originally confined to the immediate Praises of the DEITY; and that the best and wisest Men of all Ages, have had Recourse to di∣vine Hymns and spiritual Songs, in the Ef∣fusions of their Souls before the Almighty LORD of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>'ERE yet Temples were built, perhaps, or fixed Hours of Devotion set apart; when the Voice of Conscience could be heard, and the busy Scenes of Art had not yet seduced away the Attention of Man; the great Pro∣genitors of our Race, as they tended their Flocks on from Pasture to Pasture, no Doubt, often felt their Hearts rapt into this Kind of sacred Extasy, and poured them forth in un∣premeditated Strains before the LORD.— Whenever they received any signal Instance of Almighty Goodness; whenever any sur∣prizing Effect of Almighty Power struck their Sight, and kindled Admiration; that auspicious Moment, doubtless, they em∣braced and adored the invisible Hand from which the Whole proceeded; the Hand that formed the Earth, the Sun and Moon, which they beheld; that hung the Clouds in Air; that charged their Bosoms with Treasures, and bade them drop down in Fatness to rejoice Herb, and Beast, and Man.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="009424_0011_0F743BD599E03CB0"/>THESE sublime Exercises may be consi∣dered as the express Inspirations of GOD himself, being nothing else but the secret Agency of his Grace, through the Means of his Works, on the Hearts of Men, in these early Days of Simplicity."—</P>
<P>INDEED, Man could not behold the Beau∣ties of Nature, without Admiration;—every Thing within and without him, contribut∣ed to heighten this Joy into the most trans∣cendent Extasy; and a Sight of the won∣drous Objects of Creation, must inspire him to return Thanks to the great Author of his Being, in the most beautiful and pleasing Sounds his Mind could suggest! His Rap∣tures would have been but ill express'd, had he us'd the common Language;—something more sweet and harmonious; more lofty and sublime, was wanting to express the Ideas he had conceiv'd of his MAKER, and the Thanks he ow'd him for so many Blessings! And hence he ransack'd Nature for Expressions and har∣monious Sounds; he form'd to himself, as it were, a new Language, and adorn'd it with Numbers and Cadence!</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MILTON's Paradise Lost.</NOTE> Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men! thy Name</L>
<L>Shall be the copious Matter of my Song</L>
<L>Henceforth; and never shall my Harp thy Praise</L>
<L>Forget, nor from thy Father's Praise disjoin.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="12" REF="009424_0012_0F743BD5B4DACEB8"/>THIS was, doubtless, the Origin of Mu∣sick, and it has ever since been applied by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and after them by the Generality of the Professors of Christianity, to its pro∣per Object, the celebrating the Greatness of the Almighty, and the Magnificence of his Works; which the antient <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bards describ'd in the most pompous, the most majestick, and the most sublime Manner that is possible to be conceiv'd, on all pub∣lick Occasions!</P>
<P>BUT among all the Solemnities of this Nature, there is none in History so glori∣ous as that under the Reign of King <HI>Solo∣mon,</HI> at the Dedication of the Temple to the Worship of GOD:—We are told, by an unerring Mouth, that besides the great Of∣ficers of State, and Inhabitants of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> all the Elders and Heads of Tribes, with the whole Body of the People rang'd under them, from one End of the King∣dom to the other, were summon'd to assist on this solemn Occasion: When the Ark of the Covenant, containing the two Tables of the Law, was brought and deposited un∣der the Wings of the Cherubims, in the holy Place, the great Concert of Praise be∣gan:—It was enliven'd with an Hundred
<PB N="13" REF="009424_0013_0F743BD681F0BC10"/>
and Twenty <HI>Trumpets,</HI> assisted by a pro∣portionable Number of other Kinds of <HI>mu∣sical Instruments,</HI> (among which we may rest assur'd the <HI>well-ton'd</HI> ORGAN found a Place) and accompanied with a prodigious Number of Voices of all the Singers of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> who were particularly instructed and set apart for religious Performances of this Kind.</P>
<P>THE Business of this mighty Chorus was to extol their MAKER, and to excite the whole Nation, thus assembled, to the Praise of his never-ceasing Goodness and Mercy: <Q>As the Trumpets and Singers were as one, to make one Sound to be heard, in prais∣ing and thanking the Lord; and when they lift up their Voice with the Trum∣pets and Cymbals, and Instruments of Musick, they praised the Lord, saying, For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever:</Q>—On which the House was filled with a Cloud, which evidently de∣monstrated the DIVINE PRESENCE among them; insomuch that the Priests them∣selves, not being able to bear the <HI>Awful∣ness of the Solemnity,</HI> retir'd into the Court of the Temple.—In the mean While, the People, whose Hearts were gradually mov∣ed
<PB N="14" REF="009424_0014_0F743BD742B8A3D8"/>
by the Solemnity of the whole Proceed∣ing, having been melted by the <HI>all-conquer∣ing Strains of</HI> MUSICK, and aw'd by the Appearance of that Glory which fill'd the Temple, <Q>bowed themselves with their Faces to the Ground, and worshipped and praised the Lord!</Q></P>
<P>FROM hence, therefore, it appears, that it does not only betray a Want of Religion, but weak and childish Ignorance, not to see the <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of Instrumental Musick in our Acts of Devotion towards GOD; nor can it be unworthy the Regard and Notice of the highest Rank of Mankind, when view'd, as it really is, as a most sublime Acquisition!</P>
<P>AND certain it is, that among all the Studies that engage the Mind of Man, the best adapted to his Nature, and to a suitable Acknowledgement of the Greatness and Perfection of GOD, is <HI>that</HI> of <HI>Musick:</HI>— While other Creatures only hear Sounds, in such a Manner as conduce to the Purposes of Animal Life, Man is capable of discover∣ing their Proportions, and thereby qualified for the Perception and Pleasure of Harmony, which, properly speaking, cannot be as∣cribed
<PB N="15" REF="009424_0015_0F743BD7F6A768C8"/>
to any Ear but his own; and in him this Sense is, in a wonderful Manner, sub∣servient to the Use and Operation of his no∣blest Powers!</P>
<P>ON the Wings of this Faculty, we can fly in an Instant to the utmost Parts of the Earth; we can ascend on High!—Climb to Heaven!—And soar among the Stars!— We can travel on, in Idea, from World to World! From System to System!—till our Thoughts are quite lost and swallow'd in the Immensity of GOD's Works!—</P>
<P>THE best of Men, says a late Writer, have found their chief Comfort to consist in Exercises of this Kind; and those elevated Flights of the Soul to GOD, truly proclaim her divine Original, her capacious Powers, and glorious Destination for Eternity! They expand and strengthen her Faculties; im∣prove and exalt the Temper, and prepare her for the Harmony of Heaven!</P>
<P>LET dull phlegmatick Souls say what they will to the Contrary, Joy and Chear∣fulness are so far from being inconsistent with Religion, when rightly order'd, that we find them many Times allow'd and re∣commended
<PB N="16" REF="009424_0016_0F743BD919B7A610"/>
in Scripture: Thus, in the last Verse of the 32d Psalm, <HI>Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice:</HI> And in the 1st Verse of the next Psalm, <HI>Rejoice in the Lord, O ye Righteous:</HI>—So Psalm lxviii. 3, <HI>Let the Righteous be glad:—Nehemiah</HI> xii. 36, That they should praise the LORD <HI>with the musical Instruments of David the Man of God.</HI>—And that it might not be thought a Liberty pro∣per only for former Dispensations, the A∣postle does no less than three Times give this Admonition to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> <Q>Re∣joice in the Lord; rejoice always in the Lord; yea, I say rejoice.</Q>— Our Devo∣tion never soars higher, than when it is car∣ried on the Wings of Joy and Chearful∣ness: And as Joy is an excellent Institution of Devotion, so a constant Serenity and Chearfulness of Spirit, is a fit Disposition for our other Duties.</P>
<P>THE royal Psalmist <HI>David,</HI> whom it would be our greatest Perfection to imitate in the Ardency of a constant lively Devo∣tion, was among the most strenuous Promo∣ters of the divine Harmony I am contending for, in his Day:—What a pious Ardour;— what a Glow of Gratitude;— what exalted Conceptions of the Deity are every where
<PB N="17" REF="009424_0017_0F743BD985E650A0"/>
to be found in his inimitable Compositions! —How often does he call upon the Na∣tions in his Day, and us in them, to praise the LORD with the <HI>Organ!</HI>—His exalted Language is the Voice of Rapture; his Soul is kindled with divine Fervor; and it is impossible to read them without feeling Part of his Transports!— Him we seldom meet without a Psalm in his Mouth, or an Instrument in his Hand;—in whose Musick was such sweet, sacred and divine Power, that we are assur'd it had even the Efficacy of working such Miracles, as to drive the evil Spirit twice from tormenting <HI>Saul;</HI>—to compose his fluctuating Spirits; disperse the Gloom that hung over his Mind; and to restore that Monarch to the right Enjoy∣ment of his rational Faculties:—<Q>And it came to pass, when the evil Spirit was upon <HI>Saul,</HI> that <HI>David</HI> took an Harp and played with his Hand: So <HI>Saul</HI> was re∣freshed, and was well; and the evil Spi∣rit departed from him.</Q> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xvi. 23.</P>
<P>STUPID, therefore, beyond all Possibi∣lity of Excuse, must those groveling Souls be, who cannot hence learn the Lawfulness and divine Approbation of Instrumental Mu∣sick!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="009424_0018_0F743BDA4CB0C780"/>AN equal Instance of its amazing Effi∣cacy and Force, we have in the Prophet <HI>Elisha:</HI> His Spirits being ruffled and dis∣concerted; his Mind disorder'd, and under a State of Dejection, the <HI>Minstrel</HI> was called in, and calm'd him:—All the turbulent Pas∣sions which before made him the Terror of his Keepers, and a fit Inhabitant of a gloomy Cell, were in an Instant composed by the sweet Power of <HI>Musick!</HI></P>
<P>THE Mind of Man, even in Spirituals, acts with a corporal Dependence, and so is helped or hindred in its Operations, ac∣cording to the different Quality of external Objects that occur to the Senses: And it is well known, that an Impression left on the Heart by the <HI>Melody</HI> I am recommending, has tended to compose the wandering Mind much more effectually than a Sermon, or rational Discourse.</P>
<P>AN eminent Divine, within the Compass of my Memory, in his Discourse on the Subject I am contending for, told his Au∣dience there were but three Kinds of Be∣ings, that he knew of, whom GOD had en∣dow'd with Animal Sensation, who were not charm'd with the Harmony of Musick;
<PB N="19" REF="009424_0019_0F743BDAF387D560"/>
and they were the Devil, a Quaker, and an Ass: But surely had this Declaimer been sufficiently Master of his Subject, or had any Acquaintance with the World in our Day, he would have included, at least, two whole Societies of worshipping Christians in his Charge: For though indeed the <HI>Presby∣terians</HI> and <HI>Baptists</HI> hold Psalmody lawful, and an important Part of divine Worship, yet certain it is, that the miserable Manner in which this Part of their Worship is droll'd out, seems rather to imitate the Braying of Asses, than the divine Melody so often re∣commended in Scripture.</P>
<P>IT is no Pleasure to me to note this shame∣ful Defect in their Acts of Devotion towards GOD; nor is it from any Desire to expose either the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> or <HI>Baptists,</HI> that I have been thus unreserv'd;—my own Heart will acquit me of Envy or Ill-nature, since I <HI>reprove</HI> only to <HI>reform:</HI>—I profess my∣self to belong to the Former, and have been a Member of that Church from my Infan∣cy; but I could not otherwise do Justice to the Truth, and the Subject I am upon:— And, would to Heaven, that what may be offer'd on this Head, might gain their At∣tention. To them therefore, and to their serious Consideration, is this Address more immediately intended.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="009424_0020_0F743BDBE109DAF0"/>IT has, I confess, often afforded me Matter of Surprize, seeing they hold the Duty of praising GOD with the Voice of Melody as a very essential Part of publick Worship, that there has not been more Pains taken, at least, to instruct such of the rising Generation as have good Voices, in the Use of <HI>Psalmody;</HI> or, as it is well known that the <HI>Use of an Organ</HI> would not only <HI>hide all Defects of this Nature,</HI> but <HI>raise the Affec∣tions, illuminate and invigorate the Imagina∣tion, rouse and enliven all the Faculties of the Soul to Devotion, and assist the Voice;</HI> that for <HI>these,</HI> and <HI>other Benefits</HI> that would <HI>ac∣crue therefrom</HI> to the whole Assembly, in which all the Brilliancy of Thought, the Beauty of Description, the Elegance of Ex∣pression, come far short to enumerate, they do not admit the Use of such into their Acts of Devotion, seeing the <HI>whole Tenor of the Scripture</HI> is expressive of the Utility of <HI>no one human Invention more than this;</HI> and the <HI>far greater Part</HI> of Christians in <HI>all Ages,</HI> have not only view'd it in this Light, but have look'd upon an <HI>Organ</HI> as absolutely ne∣cessary for <HI>the Decency of publick Worship,</HI> as well as the Advantages above cited.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Calvinist Dutch,</HI> though they are universally acknowledged to be among
<PB N="21" REF="009424_0021_0F743BDC6E7EF440"/>
the best Singers of divine Musick in the known World, never think their publick Worship compleat without <HI>the Help of an Organ;</HI> many of them also, who are of Cir∣cumstances, keep the same Instrument in their Chambers for the Use of Family Wor∣ship:—We have ever confessed them sound in the Principles of Religion, and in this Respect have acknowledged them our Bre∣thren:—What a Pity it is then, that we should <HI>differ from them in this.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Church of England</HI> too, <Q>between whose doctrinal Articles, (as pious Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> very justly observes) and our <HI>Westminster Confession of Faith,</HI> there is the sweetest Harmony,</Q> has always, since the Reformation, been eminent for continuing and encouraging this noble In∣stitution: Nor can I at present recollect any one Society, among all the various Sects and Professions into which the World is divided, the <HI>Presbyterians, Baptists,</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> excepted, <HI>who do not approve of</HI> and <HI>use,</HI> as their Circumstances and Oppor∣tunies enable them, the Instrument I am recommending, in their publick Acts of Devotion.—And will the most bigotted a∣mong us be hardy enough to assert that we only are right in this Particular?—However
<PB N="22" REF="009424_0022_0F743BDE65387528"/>
this may be, I do contend, that a sad and sullen Humour, a morose and melancholy Disposition, either in the Worship of GOD or otherwise, is so far from being commend∣able, that at best it must be looked upon as an Infirmity and Weakness, in the best of those in whom it resides; and if purposely affected and cherish'd, may deserve a severe Censure.</P>
<P>I WOULD by no Means, however, be un∣derstood, in the Course of my Arguments on this Head, as though these external Things should be held as Parts of our De∣votion, or are by any Strength in them∣selves, consider'd abstractedly, direct Causes of it; all I contend is, that the Grace of GOD, for the most Part, is pleased, in Con∣descension to our Infirmities, to work upon our Passions by Means, and move us by Ways suited to our Nature, and to sanctify these inferior Helps to greater and higher Purposes.</P>
<P>NOR can I see the least Impropriety in the Institution I am recommending: In the first and most <HI>early Times of the Church,</HI> what Care did GOD manifest not only to have such Places erected to his Honour,
<PB N="23" REF="009424_0023_0F743BDF1C442520"/>
but <HI>decently</HI> ornamented? <HI>Jacob</HI> was admo∣nished by a Vision, as by a Message from Heaven, to build him an Altar, which was view'd by him ever after with the most profound Veneration! — <Q>How dreadful (says he) is this Place, for surely it is no other than the House of GOD!</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT Pretence to Spirituality and Humility, (says pious Mr. <HI>Gilb. Tennent</HI>) which is only a Covert to Covetousness, Indifference, or Party-prejudice in the Matters of Religion, is a mean and mon∣strous Evil, that should be abhorr'd by all Mankind!—Those severe Zealots <HI>who censure all Ornaments in Churches,</HI> though they do not neglect them in their Dress and private Houses,—surely, they herein act a very inconsistent Part, and consequently not only condemn the whole Body of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, but even pass Sentence upon GOD himself, <HI>who appointed Ornaments in his House by his Sovereign Authority,</HI> and complained by his Prophet of those covetous Misers who had <HI>cieled</HI> Houses of their own, but left <HI>his</HI> House <HI>desolate,</HI> i. e. <HI>Naked, and be∣reaved of proper Ornaments!</HI></Q>—</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="009424_0024_0F743BDF72827F08"/>WHAT an immense Profusion of Trea∣sure and Pains, as far excel all the Pomp of modern Times, must have been expend∣ed in decorating the Temple, and making and preparing various Sorts of Musical Instruments to be used in the Service of GOD at its Dedication; and in instructing such as had good Voices, and other suitable Qualifications, to accompany the same in this grand Chorus? No less than <HI>four Thou∣sand praised the Lord with the Instruments that I made</HI> (says David) <HI>to praise therewith;</HI> 1 Chron. xxiii. 5.—<HI>And David spake to the Chief of the Levites, to appoint their Brethren to be Singers to all the Instruments of Musick, and by sounding and lifting up their Voices with Joy;</HI> 1 Chron. xv. 16.—<HI>So the Num∣ber of them, with their Brethren, that were instructed in the Songs of the Lord, was two Hundred Eighty and Eight;</HI> 1 Chron. xxv. 7. <HI>—And David and all Israel played before the Lord with all their Might;</HI> 1 Chron. xiii. 8. <HI>—And all the Congregation worshipped, and the Singers sung, and the Instruments sounded with them; and the Glory of the Lord filled the whole House;</HI> 2 Chron. xxix. 28.</P>
<P>AND certain it is, that such Places are na∣turally apt to excite a greater Reverence and
<PB N="25" REF="009424_0025_0F743BE0349DC9A0"/>
Devotion, in the Discharge of Divine Ser∣vice, than Places of common Use: <HI>Here have I placed my Name,</HI> says GOD, <HI>and here will I dwell, for I have a Delight therein.—</HI> The Place properly reminds Men of their Business there, and strikes a Kind of Awe into their Thoughts when they reflect on that great and sacred Majesty they used to treat and converse with there.</P>
<P><Q>OH! how often has the very Tears gush'd out of mine Eyes, says pious St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> at hearing the sweet Hymns and Songs of God! How have I been ravished with the Praises and Harmony of the sweet-sounding Church, when those sweet Voices, accompanied with the Organ, have pierced mine Ears! Thy Truth, O LORD, hath then distilled into mine Heart, and from thence I felt my∣self inflamed with Piety and Devotion.</Q></P>
<P>AND is there any Man (whose Heart has not shook off all Sense of what is sacred) who finds himself no otherwise affected when he enters into the House of God, than when he enters into that of his own or his Neighbour's?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="009424_0026_0F743BE0EF88BF38"/>IT has ever been the unhappy Fate of Su∣perstition, that, by pretending to too much Religion, it has sapped the Foundation of all Religion; and, by being productive of such contracted Notions, that have no Being but in a blind misguided Zeal, it has levelled the divine Oracles of the most high GOD with the weak Opinions of frail Man. And sorry I am to observe, that the Clergy, whose Business it is to inform the Under∣standing, as well as mend the Hearts of their Hearers, are shamefully culpable in this Particular: And it is a Truth, which re∣dounds but little to their Reputation, either as Preachers of the Gospel or intelligent Be∣ings, that too many are led by them to be∣lieve, that if there is Salvation to be had out of the Pales of their own Church, it is ne∣vertheless criminal, in the highest Degree, even to enter the Doors of any other.</P>
<P>AND I am well aware, that the far great∣er Part of those who decry the Use of In∣strumental Musick in the Worship of GOD, have never had a single Opportunity even of being present at those Acts of Devotion in which the <HI>Organ</HI> is used, and of making the Experiment: And, because instrumental Jargon, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fiddle and Bagpipe, which
<PB N="27" REF="009424_0027_0F743BE1B18692D8"/>
they have all been bless'd in hearing, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THIS Remark is more immediately intended for the Country, where it is well known Bigotry and certain nar∣row-contracted Notions, in Matters of Religion, reign most predominant.</NOTE> (but which indeed have hardly any Resemblance at all of the Instrument I am contending for, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Organ</HI>) are used in those riot∣ous Assemblies that are calculated to excite carnal Mirth and Wantonness, they con∣clude, unheard, <HI>all Instrumental Musick</HI> must have a like Tendency to inflame the Passions to Sensuality.—With the same Force of Rea∣son, Persons who are blinded with Prejudice and Ignorance, may cavil at and decry the Utility of the most useful Creatures and In∣ventions that GOD has appointed for the Support and Conveniency of Man:—Be∣cause Food and Raiment are frequently per∣verted to Voluptuousness and Wantonness, is it criminal to use either?—Because the richest Genius, like the most fertile Soil, when misled by a wrong Bent of Education, shoots up into the rankest Weeds, and in∣stead of Vines and Olives, produces to its Possessor the most abundant Crop of Poi∣son; are we therefore to suffer our Minds to remain in the darkest Ignorance?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="009424_0028_0F743BE2BA5230E8"/>THIS most disingenious Way of arguing, which is really the Foundation of <HI>all that can be said</HI> against the Use of Instrumental Musick in the Worship of GOD, is so very ridiculous, that one would wonder with what Face or Colour of Reason the Profes∣sors of Christianity, who have been bless'd with the Light of the Gospel, and who, if properly informed, might know better, could make Use of it.</P>
<P>WERE not Advice thrown away on such, one would recommend it to them, laying Prejudice aside, to step into St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s in this City, or any other Church that has an Organ in it, and let them afterwards speak their Sentiments impartially:—They will find it impossible to be present at such Acts of Worship, without being elevated with their <HI>divine Melody,</HI> and feeling some Degree of that <HI>heavenly Enthusiasm</HI> which spreads it∣self through the whole Assembly; which is not only a strong Proof of the Propriety and Expediency of the Institution, but gives a pleasing Idea, that the Cause of Christiani∣ty in such Churches is not so desperate as the frantick Triumphs of the Vicious and Profane insinuate, or the Gloomy and De∣sponding are apt to believe.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="009424_0029_0F743BE36515CA28"/>I MENTION this Church in particular, as being the only <HI>English</HI> Congregation in the Province that has an Organ in it as yet, and as being a Church in which it will be con∣fess'd Vocal Musick is also brought to the greatest Perfection of any Society perhaps in the Province:—Indeed, the Public seem not to be insensible of these Advantages; for, though it is said to be the largest Building erected for the publick Worship of God on the Continent, such Multitudes flock thi∣ther, of <HI>all Denominations,</HI> as very frequently not to find Room.</P>
<P>IT would, I confess, be the highest In∣justice in me here (and it would be paying the Audience but a poor Compliment) to insinuate, but that the Certainty of hearing a <HI>spirited Discourse,</HI> deliver'd with <HI>a becom∣ing Warmth and Energy,</HI> and <HI>enforced with that Dignity and Solemnity becoming the sa∣cred Desk,</HI> has its proper Weight with the Multitude who flock thither; but I do con∣tend, that no House of Worship in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> was ever so crouded before, except when the inimitable <HI>Whitefield</HI> graced the same.</P>
<P>THE Members of the two <HI>episcopal Churches</HI> in this City, sensible of the Ad∣vantages
<PB N="30" REF="009424_0030_0F743BE425DEB7A8"/>
cited in the preceding Pages, and encouraged by the Certainty of being able to get Organs made here in <HI>as great Per∣fection</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI> and near <HI>one Half cheaper,</HI> have lately rais'd suitable Contri∣butions among themselves, with which to erect a very genteel one in their respective Churches; and many in the Country are fol∣lowing their laudable Example.</P>
<P>AND would to GOD, that, divested of eve∣ry Prejudice, this amiable Spirit of promo∣ting the <HI>decent Worship of</HI> GOD would dif∣fuse itself among the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and <HI>Bap∣tists</HI> also. — What a glorious Appearance would an ORGAN make in some of their Churches, especially in this and the neigh∣bouring Cities! Nor would one look out of Character in the meanest Building in the Country.—We should not by this deviate more from the Faith of <HI>true Presbyterianism,</HI> than those of our Brethren in <HI>Scotland, Ire∣land,</HI> and <HI>America</HI> do, who have Steeples with Bells to their Churches (where they are of Ability) which are not only used at stated Times for Worship, Times of public Rejoicing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but toll at the Death and Interment not only of their own Members, but Persons of any other Persuasion who re∣quest,
<PB N="31" REF="009424_0031_0F743BE4AF089A88"/>
and will go to the Expence of the same: The Generality of our Clergy also in the <HI>old Countries</HI> wear the same decent Badges of Distinction (<HI>viz.</HI> the Gown and Band) with the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> so that the introducing the Use of the <HI>Organ</HI> into our Acts of Worship, would not bring us one Jot nearer to <HI>Pope∣ry</HI> or <HI>Episcopacy</HI> than we were before, as some of our weak but well-meaning Pro∣fessors may be apt to imagine.</P>
<P>BESIDES the Advantages cited in the pre∣ceding Pages, such an Institution would have this good Tendency, that, instead of their Members loitering away the blessed Sabbath Day at Home, sequestering themselves from the rest of Mankind in unsocial Retirements, or <HI>crouding other Houses of Worship,</HI> it would induce them to croud <HI>their own:</HI> — And, till this is taken <HI>into Consideration,</HI> they have, I fear, very little Grounds to expect their Congregations will either thrive or in∣crease on their Hands.</P>
<P>INDEED, however it may affect some particular Societies, it must afford a sensible Pleasure to every generous Mind, not con∣fin'd to the <HI>narrow Principles of Party,</HI> to
<PB N="32" REF="009424_0032_0F743BE71797C3B0"/>
see such a laudable Spirit prevail, as at pre∣sent, for promoting so essential a Part of the publick Worship of GOD.—<Q>How can the most harden'd Sinner, says Bishop <HI>Beve∣ridge</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PRIVATE THOUGHTS.</NOTE>, who has made a Scorn of this <HI>noble Part</HI> of <HI>Devotion,</HI> but be softened and reclaimed, and have a Veneration for it, when he hears the Praises of our great CREATOR described in the most ex∣pressive <HI>Harmony?</HI> when it was his great and infinite Goodness to bestow and frame <HI>Musick</HI> for us to the very same End: And we are in <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> bound to praise him therewith, both in our <HI>publick</HI> and <HI>private Devotions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS is that which makes Heaven itself so pleasant a Place to those who dwell therein, because they are always praising GOD:—There the celestial Choirs pour forth their triumphant Hallelujahs to his adorable Name! They cast their Crowns at his Feet, saying, <Q>Worthy art thou, O LORD, to re∣ceive Glory, and Honour, and Power!—</Q> There the Cherubims and Seraphims conti∣nually do cry, "Holy, Holy LORD GOD of Sabbath!"—There the glorious Compa∣ny of the Apostles <HI>praise Him:</HI>—There the
<PB N="33" REF="009424_0033_0F743BE7E0130F40"/>
goodly Fellowship of the Prophets <HI>praise Him:</HI>—There the noble Army of the Mar∣tyrs <HI>praise Him:</HI>—There all the Spirits of just Men made perfect <HI>praise Him continually!</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the exalted Strain of Scripture Language in its Descriptions of Heaven, when it would awaken our Diligence and engage our Affections in the Pursuit of it.</P>
<P>BLESSED with such Prospects, we ought ever to maintain a deep Sense of our Ma∣ker's Bounty and Goodness, and to be con∣tinually acknowledging our Obligations with the utmost Gratitude, Sincerity, and Vene∣ration.—To be created with intelligent Pow∣ers and Understanding; to bear the Signa∣ture of GOD's Image; and be qualified for the Joys of a blessed Immortality, are Goods really inestimable, and Privileges above Price! As such, they demand suitable Sentiments, and our most solemn Thanksgiving.</P>
<P>THIS evidently appears to have been the happy Temper of the holy Psalmist, whose affectionate Acknowledgments of the Good∣ness and Bounty of GOD, in the chearful Celebration of his Praise, make up a consi∣derable Part of his divine and ravishing
<PB N="34" REF="009424_0034_0F743BE8731BFC00"/>
Songs:—How often do we find him exci∣ting and disposing himself and others to join Voice, Hand and Heart together, in this holy and delightful Employment!—Psalm xxxiii. 2, 3, <HI>Praise the Lord with the Harp; sing unto him with the Psaltery, and an Instru∣ment of ten Strings: Sing unto him a new Song, play skilfully with a loud Voice:</HI>—Psalm lxvi. 1, 8, <HI>Make a joyful Noise unto God, all ye Lands: Oh! bless our God, ye People, and make the Voice of his Praise to be heard:—</HI> Psalm lxxi. 22, <HI>I will also praise thee with the Psaltery, even thy Truth, O my God; un∣to thee will I sing with the Harp, O thou Ho∣ly One of Israel:</HI>—Psalm xcviii. 5, 6, <HI>Sing unto the Lord with the Harp; with the Harp and the Voice of a Psalm: With Trumpets and Sound of Cornet make a joyful Noise before the Lord the King:—</HI>Psalm cl. 4, <HI>Praise him with Organs:—</HI>1 Chron. xvi. 42, <HI>And with musical Instruments of God.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Powers of Vocal and Instru∣mental Musick thus unite in one joint Cho∣rus, he must certainly have a Heart not of Flesh, but of Marble, insusceptible of all tender Impressions, who can withstand their united Force.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="009424_0035_0F743BE944E38E70"/>I AM well aware, that many well-mean∣ing People have been led to decry the Use of the <HI>Organ</HI> in divine Worship, because the <HI>New Testament</HI> is not more expressive of its Utility: But I think it may be laid down as a fundamental Truth, that the <HI>only Reason</HI> why the Use of it is not more frequently in∣culcated in the <HI>New Testament</HI> is, that it was a Doctrine <HI>so well received</HI> by all Deno∣minations of Men, as to render <HI>any Thing</HI> on that Head <HI>intirely unnecessary:</HI> Thus, should any settled <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Divine in our Day presume to take up his own and his Hearers Time in proving the Lawfulness of Psalmody, as a Part of their publick Acts of Worship, would not the Hearers very justly infer the Preacher was drove to his last Shift for Subject-matter?—The Man, say they, may with the same Face engross our Time in proving that the Sun shines at Noon-day, or that it is dark at Twelve at Night.</P>
<P>IN the preceding Pages I have shewn, from the Authority of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> the divine Approbation of, and even Command for erecting the Temple for public Wor∣ship:—I have shewn what a Profusion of Cost and Pains was expended in furnishing it with decent Ornaments, and in erecting
<PB N="36" REF="009424_0036_0F743BE9FB560C58"/>
in it suitable Instruments of Musick, with which to assist in the Worship of GOD: And thus much I am warranted to assert from the <HI>New,</HI> that, as our LORD and his Apostles are often said to have made Use of this very Temple for the Performance of divine Service therein, it evidences, to a Demonstration, his continued Approba∣tion of the Place, and of the decent Orna∣ments with which it was decorated: Nor will any reasonable Man presume to say, that the costly and magnificent <HI>Organ,</HI> which had been erected therein for divine Worship from the most early Dedication of that sacred Edifice to the Service of GOD, had been pulled down on the Approach of the Saviour of the World, or was for ever after silent. Had this actually been the Case, it would have been too remarkable an Incident to have been passed over in Silence by the sacred Penmen: On the contrary, our Lord's Veneration for it rose so high, as to induce him to whip the Profaners of it hence; in which Act he brings a Quotation from the <HI>Old Testament</HI> to shew the original In∣tent of that sacred Edifice:—<Q>It is written, says he, <HI>Isaiah</HI> lvi. 7. and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> vii. 11. My House shall be called the House of Prayer, but ye have made it a Den of
<PB N="37" REF="009424_0037_0F743BEADD203128"/>
Thieves;</Q> but we have not the least Au∣thority from hence to infer that he attempt∣ed to pull down, deface, alter, or render useless any the most minute Article of its Contents: Nor do we find a single Text in the Whole of the <HI>New Testament</HI> disapprov∣ing or disallowing the Use of Instrumental Musick in the Worship of God; which plainly demonstrates, that such Things were not only continued in Use, but were ap∣prov'd of and allow'd as heretofore. And this seems so plainly to be the Case, that it might be esteemed a Reproach to human Reason to use more Arguments to evince its Utility, seeing the universal Reception it has met with from all thinking People, in all Ages of the World, and in all Places, manifestly evidences, that it is entirely suit∣able, proportionate, and agreeable to the general Conception and Reason of Man∣kind.</P>
<P>I DOUBT not but I shall be condemned by some of my Readers for having expres∣sed myself with too much Warmth on this Subject; and by others for having omitted saving many Things which the Authority of Holy Writ gives me a sufficient Warrant to have urg'd:—As to the first, the Instances
<PB N="38" REF="009424_0038_0F743BEC63980F80"/>
I daily see, or am creditably inform'd of, join'd to the Good-will I bear to Mankind in general, would not permit me to be more cool:—And as to the other, I thought it proper to leave the strongest Part of the Argument to the reverend Clergy, who can best handle it, and whose Province it is:— Certainly there is nothing more demands their present Care, or would testify their Zeal for the Well-being and Promotion of Religion in the World.</P>
<P>THE Worst, however, that can be said of this Attempt is, that it is the Overflow∣ing of a Heart sincere and ardent for the Happiness of Society in general, and of that of which I am a Member in particular.</P>
