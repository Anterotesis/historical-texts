<L>And wild as a kitten, and wild as a kitten,</L>
<L>Those eyes in your face—(O pity my case)</L>
<L>Poor Dermot hath smitten, poor Dermot hath smitten.</L>

<L>Or orange from Seville, or orange from Seville.</L>
<L>When dress'd in your boddice, you trip like a goddess,</L>
<L>So nimbly, so frisky; so nimbly, so frisky:</L>
<L>A kiss on your cheek, 'tis so soft and so sleek,</L>
<L>Would warm me like whisky, would warm me like whisky;</L>
</LG>

<L>I grunt and I pine, and fob like a swine,</L>
<L>Because you're so cruel, because you're so cruel:</L>
<L>No rest can I take, and asleep or awake</L>
<L>I dream of my jewel, I dream of my jewel.</L>
<L>Your hate then give over, nor Dermot your lover.</L>
<L>So cruelly handle, so cruelly handle!</L>

<L>IT was summer so softly the breezes were blowing,</L>
<L>And sweetly the nightingale sung from a tree,</L>
<L>At the foot of the rock, when the river was flowing,</L>
<L>I sat myself down on the banks of the Dee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Flow on, lovely Dee, flow on, thou sweet river,</L>
<L>Thy bank's purest streams shall be dear to me ever,</L>
<L>'Twas there I first gain'd the affection and favor</L>
<L>Of Jamie, the glory and pride of the Dee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now he's gone from me, and left me thus mourn∣ing,</L>
<L>To quell the proud Spaniards, so valient is he;</L>
<L>And yet there's no hope of his speedy returning,</L>
<L>To wander again on the banks of the Dee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He's gone, hapless youth, o'er the loud roaring billows,</L>
<L>The sweetest and kindest of all his brave fellows,</L>
<L>And has left me to mourn amongst these green willows,</L>
<L>The lonesomest maid on the banks of the Dee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But time and my prayers may perhaps yet restore him,</L>
<L>Blest peace may restore the dear shepherd to me;</L>
<L>And when he comes home, with such care I'll watch o'er him,</L>
<L>He never shall quit the sweet banks of the Dee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Dee then shall flow, all its beauties displaying,</L>
<L>The lambs on its banks shall again be seen playing,</L>
<L>Whilst I with my Jamie am carelessly straying,</L>

<HEAD>The Cobler.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A COBLER there was, and he liv'd in a stall,</L>
<L>Which serv'd him for parlour, for kitchen, and hall,</L>
<L>No coin in his pocket, nor care in his pate,</L>
<L>No ambition had he, nor duns at his gate:</L>
<L>Derry down, down, down, derry down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Contented he work'd, and he thought himself happy,</L>
<L>If at night he could purchase a jug of brown nappy:</L>
<L>How he'd laugh then, and whistle, and sing too most sweet!</L>
<L>Saying, just to a hair I have made both ends to meet:</L>
<L>Derry down, down, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But love, the disturber of high and of low,</L>
<L>That shoots at the peasant as well as the beau;</L>
<L>He shot the poor cobler quite through the heart,</L>
<L>I wish he had hit some more ignoble part:</L>
<L>Derry down, down, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It was from a cellar this archer play,</L>
<L>Where a buxom young damsel continually lay;</L>
<L>Her eyes shone so bright when she rose ev'ry day,</L>
<L>That she shot the poor cobler quite over the way:</L>
<L>Derry down, down, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He sung her love songs as he sat at his work,</L>
<L>But she was as hard as a Jew or a Turk;</L>
<L>Whenever he spake, she would flounce and would fleer,</L>
<L>Which put the poor cobler quite into despair,</L>
<L>Derry down, down, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He took up his awl that he had in the world,</L>
<L>And to make away with himself was resolv'd;</L>
<L>He pierc'd through his body instead of his sole,</L>
<L>So the cobler he died, and the bell it did toll.</L>
<L>Derry down, down, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, in good will, I advise as a friend,</L>
<L>All coblers take warning by this cobler's end:</L>
<L>Keep your hearts out of love, for we find by what's past,</L>
<L>That love brings us all to an end at the last.</L>
<L>Derry down, down, &amp;c.</L>

<L>Step gently down, you've nought to fear</L>

<L>My dad and mam are fast asleep,</L>

<L>LAST Valentine's day, when bright Phoebus shone clear,</L>
<L>I had not been hunting for more than a year:</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="031961_0059_0FEF68B3EB6E54F8"/>
I mounted black Sloven, o'er the road made him bound,</L>
<L>For I heard the hounds challenge, and horns sweetly sound,</L>
<L>Taleo taleo taleo taleo taleo taleo taleo.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hallo into cover, old Authony cries,</L>
<L>No sooner he spoke, but the fox, sir, he spies;</L>
<L>This being the signal, he then crack'd his whip;</L>
<L>Taleo was the word, and away we did leap.</L>
<L>Taleo, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then up rides Dick Dawson, who ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d not a pin,</L>
<L>He sprang at the drain, but his horse tumbled in.</L>
<L>And as he crept out, why he spi'd old Ren',</L>
<L>With his tongue hanging out, stealing home to his den.</L>
<L>Taleo, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our hounds and our horses were always as good</L>
<L>As ever broke covert, or dash'd thro' the wood;</L>
<L>Old Reynard runs hard, but must certainly die,</L>
<L>Have at you, old Tony, Dick Dawson did cry.</L>
<L>Taleo, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The hounds they had run twenty miles now or more,</L>
<L>Old Anthony fretted, he cursed too and swore,</L>
<L>But Reynard being spent soon must give up the ghost,</L>
<L>Which will heighten our joys when we come to each toast.</L>
<L>Talco, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The day's sport being over, the horns we will sound,</L>
<L>To the jolly fox-hunters let echo resound,</L>
<L>So fill up your glasses, and chearfully drink,</L>

<LG>
<L>'Twas early day, as poets say,</L>
<L>Just when the sun was rising,</L>

<L>Who won't let me alone, though I bid him depart;</L>
<L>Such questions he puts, since I answer him so,</L>
<L>That he makes me mean yes, thro' words are still no.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He ask'd, did I hate him, or think him too plain?</L>
<L>(Let me die if he is not a clever young swain.)</L>
<L>If he ventur'd a kiss, if I from him would go,</L>
<L>Then he press'd my young lips, while I blush'd, and said no.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He ask'd if my heart to another was gone?</L>
<L>If I'd have him to leave me, or cease to love on?</L>
<L>If I meant my life long to answer him so?</L>
<L>I faulter'd, and sigh'd, and reply'd to him, no.</L>

<P>Sung at the celebration of the Fourth of July, 1793, in Passyunk Township, by a Select Company.</P>
<P>Tune—Jeho Dobbin.</P>
<LG>
<L>WEST of th' old Atlantic, firm Liberty stands!</L>
<L>Hov'ring Fame just alighted, supported by bands</L>
<L>Of native free born, who still loudly sing,</L>
<L>"We'll defend our just rights against tyrant and king."</L>
<L>Chorus, <HI>Taral Laddey,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>George the Third she disowns, and his proud lordly cheats,</L>
<L>His murdering legions and half famish'd fleets,</L>
<L>Who flew thro' the Jersies, with fear quite dismay'd,</L>
<L>Altho' they much boasted that "fighting's their trade."</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our just rights to assert hath the Congress ost tried,</L>
<L>Whose wisdom and strength our opponents deride;</L>
<L>And still, madly, in rage, their weak thunders are hurl'd,</L>
<L>To bring us on our knees, and to bully the world.</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too haughty to quit, yet too weak to withstand,</L>
<L>They skulk to their ships and leave us the firm land,</L>
<L>In dread left they share, what Jack Burgoyne did feel,</L>
<L>And the game be quite lost, as poor Jack lost his deal.</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Jack, thinking of Cribbage, All Fours, or of Putt,</L>
<L>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dexterous hand he did shuffle and cut;</L>
<L>And when likely to lose (like a sharper they say)</L>
<L>Did attempt to reneague—I mean run-away.</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="98" REF="031961_0108_0FEF698CB2C711B8"/>
<L>But watched so closely, he could not play booty,</L>
<L>Yet, to cheat he sain would (for George 'twas his duty.)</L>
<L>A great bet depending on that single game.</L>
<L>Dominion and honor, destruction and shame.</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He examin'd with care his most critical hand,</L>
<L>At a loss (if 't were better) to beg or to stand;</L>
<L>His tricks reckoned up, for all sharpers can jangle,</L>
<L>Then kick'd up a dust for his favourite wrangle.</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas diamond cut diamond, spades were of no use,</L>
<L>But to dig up the way to surrender or truce,</L>
<L>For he dreaded the hand that dealt out such thumps,</L>
<L>As the hearts were run out, and clubs were then trumps.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>Chorus.</HEAD>
<L>Thus he met with the rubbers, as the game it turn'd out,</L>
<L>Poor Jack, altho' beat, made a terrible rout;</L>
<L>Complain'd he was cheated, yet, pompously talks,</L>
<L>Quit the game with a curse, while he rubb'd out the chalks.</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But see a cloud burst, and four Cherubs appear!</L>
<L>Loud trumpeting peace, while in blood to their ears,</L>
<L>With Bulls and with pardons, for us on submission,</L>
<L>To lull us and gull us, by their <HI>sham commission.</HI></L>
<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The haughty great George, then to peace is now prone,</L>
<L>A bully, when match'd, soon can alter his tone;</L>
<L>'Tis the act of a Briton to bluster and threaten,</L>
<L>Hang his tail like a puppy, when handsomely beaten.</L>
<L>Chorus.</L>

<L>May their counsels in wisdom and valour unite,</L>

<L>Chorus.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The great Doctor FRANKLIN the next glass must claim,</L>
<L>Whose electrical rod struck terror and shame;</L>
<L>Like Moses who caus'd Pharaoh's heart strings to grumble,</L>

<L>ON the cliffs of the <HI>Andes,</HI> where virtue once reign'd,</L>
<L>The voice of true freedom is heard;</L>
<L>There tyranny long has her empire sustain'd,</L>
<L>Over plains, where once worth was rever'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But tyranny soon may lament the sad yoke,</L>
<L>Which over these regions he cast;</L>
<L>His sceptre is shatter'd, his courage quite broke;</L>
<L>And at freedom now trembles at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The beams of humanity mildly have shone,</L>
<L>O'er countries which droop'd under rage;</L>
<L>They own the mild warmth of our more northern sun,</L>
<L>And dare in all conflicts engage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our states the first glorious example display'd,</L>
<L>Which soon ov'r the world shall be spread;</L>
<L>All shall share in our freedom, and shall share in our trade,</L>
<L>Whilst Columbians on tyranny tread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here let me mention, whilst tears stain each cheek.</L>
<L>The fate of the Spanish bold chief:</L>
<L>A new world determin'd o'er ocean to seek,</L>
<L>He wish'd to the natives relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His valor was great, and his conduct renown'd;</L>
<L>Humanity still was his aim;</L>
<L>Three ages the worth of <HI>Columbus</HI> refound,</L>
<L>By virtue aspiring to fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="134" REF="031961_0144_0FEF69EF73CD42D0"/>
<L>Both Spaniards and natives still wishing to bless,</L>
<L>Worth and commerce he still kept in view;</L>
<L>He thought—but the victim, alas! of distress,</L>
<L>Vile rancour he could not subdue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold him at length, quite bereft of support,</L>
<L>In chains, in a dungeon confin'd;</L>
<L>The martyr he died of a barbarous court;</L>
<L>But a moral has left for mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On ev'ry heart be that moral impress'd,</L>
<L>Ye patriots! ye heroes! attend;</L>
<L>And learn, that a courtier good faith ne'er express'd,</L>
<L>That a king can be never a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Belisarius,</HI> if ever <HI>Justinian</HI> could slight,</L>
<L>True reason such rule must disown;</L>
<L>And all should the praise of Columbus recite,</L>
<L>Whilst Philip disgrac'd a great throne.</L>

<HEAD>SONG, Sung at the Celebration of the Anniversary of the Liberty of the French, at Liverpool, in Eng∣land.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>UNFOLD, Father TIME, thy long records un∣fold,</L>
<L>Of noble atchievments accomplish'd of old;</L>
<L>When men, by the standard of Liberty led,</L>
<L>Undauntedly conquer'd, or cheerfully bled;</L>

<L>As spring to the field, or as dew to the flower,</L>

<L>Too long had oppression and terror entwin'd</L>

<L>France! we share in the rapture thy bosom that fills</L>

<L>Prouder wave thy green woods, and thine olive trees grow:</L>

<LG>
<L>WHEN our Fathers came o'e,</L>
<L>To this wilderness shore,</L>
<L>They all hazards and dangers despised;</L>
<L>For by tyrants oppress'd,</L>
<L>They came hither in quest,</L>
<L>Of Freedom, by the brave ever priz'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="161" REF="031961_0171_0FEF695F2D2F2F38"/>
<L>'Twas with labor and toil,</L>
<L>They improved the soil,</L>
<L>For the wilderness bloom'd like the rose;</L>
<L>And with plenty being crown'd,</L>
<L>To the nations around,</L>
<L>Terms of friendship and peace did propose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, lo! each savage tribe,</L>
<L>With perfidy ally'd!</L>
<L>Were strangers to peace, friendship, and truth;</L>
<L>For 'tis <HI>Scalps</HI> that they prize,</L>
<L>They are deaf to the cries,</L>
<L>Of the insant, the aged, or youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length they were quell'd,</L>
<L>And by valor compell'd,</L>
<L>With submission to sue for a peace;</L>
<L>Thus our fathers renown'd,</L>
<L>Were with victory crown'd,</L>
<L>And their offspring began to encrease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So with Liberty bless'd,</L>
<L>They departed to rest,</L>
<L>And the fruits of their toil left their sons;</L>
<L>Whose firm hearts, like their fires,</L>
<L>Love of Freedom inspires,</L>
<L>And the shackles of Slavery shun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For, behold British pride,</L>
<L>With oppression ally'd,</L>
<L>Soon disturb'd this our envied state:</L>
<L>First, with <HI>Stamps</HI> they oppress'd,</L>
<L>Which, though quickly redress'd,</L>
<L>They still cherish foul envy and hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the tale is too long,</L>
<L>It would burthen my song,</L>
<L>To relate how they threaten'd us all i</L>
<L>That unless we'd submit,</L>
<L>To the <HI>terms</HI> they thought fit,</L>
<L>Without mercy they on us would fall.</L>

<PB N="162" REF="031961_0172_0FEF6943CEABC0A8"/>
<L>That such threats were in vain,</L>
<L>Is well known to each swain,</L>
<L>Who rambles thro' the lawn or the grove;</L>

<L>Quickly beat the shamade,</L>

<L>Do you know what a king is? by Patrick I'll tell you—</L>

<L>At corruption and taxes they never repine;</L>

<L>Be contented with that—and no more of your rout,</L>
