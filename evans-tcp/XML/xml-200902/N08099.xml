<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends, Brethren and Sisters,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is in my Mind, by way of Introduction to the following EXTRACTS, to remind us of one of the principal Ends of our peculiar Call by the Spirit of God, from the Spirit of the World, to be a People seperate from the many religious Names, as well as their corrupt Nature; called of God, (to exhibit an Example of Righteousness to the World)

or would appear to them; <HI>to open the Eyes of the Blind,</HI> clos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the God of this World; <HI>to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God, that they might receive Forgiveness of Sins, and an Inheritance among them that are sanctified by Faith in Christ.</HI> Divine Wisdom farther designed we should be as <HI>the Salt of the Earth,</HI> to season Men by our savoury Conversation, and to be <HI>the Lights of the World,</HI> that others might be directed thereby in the living Way to the Kingdom of God; <HI>a City</HI> set in an eminent and conspicuous Situation, that could not be hid; in Dignity above all others, uniform, compact and consistent; at Unity with its Self; govern'd by Laws and Maxims founded in the Light and Truth, which instructs and requires the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Zion,</HI> the holy Hill of the Lord, to glorify God in whatsoever they put their Hands unto, that thereby others might be incited to believe in the Light through their Word, or the powerful Influ∣ence of their truly <HI>Christian</HI> Practice and Example, that at length these also might bring forth much Fruit to the Praise and Glory of God.</P>
<P>Was this then one great Purpose of our high and holy Calling, as a <HI>Christian</HI> Society in general, and the <HI>Ministry</HI> in particular? Most certainly yes. Then it is evident, that our Concern for temporal, spiritual, and eternal Things, is not to be limited to ourselves; no Man is born merely for himself, and no Man lives or dies to himself; but his Life and Death hath a Tendency to promote Good or Evil. Our Views were intended, by divine Wisdom, to be directed in the first Place, to the Honour of God; in the next, to our own Benefit, and the Good of our Brethren and fellow Creatures; and therefore the Apostle enjoins the <HI>Christian</HI> Converts, <HI>to do all Things to the Glory of God;</HI> and cautions them against <HI>seeking only their own Things,</HI> but bids every Man <HI>look also on the things of others;</HI> which he thus farther
<PB REF="010337_0004_0F7E8081E2FAE908"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>Let no Man seek his own,</HI> (altogether) <HI>but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man another's Wealth,</HI> Welfare, or Profit, in Temporals as well as spiritual Things. Here then is the religious Justice due first to God, and next, from one Member of the <HI>Christian</HI> Church to another, as well as to Mankind in general. And how much greater is this Obligation on <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Elders,</HI> to whom the Care, Instruction, exampling, feeding and Oversight of the Flock, Family or Church of Christ, is committed? In this Sense, every one is obliged to be his <HI>Brother's Keeper:</HI> An awful and momentous Charge indeed! How great then must be the Guilt we lie under, if we discharge not this sacred Trust committed to us by God himself? How cautiously then ought <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Elders, &amp;c,</HI> to walk in all godly Fear and Circumspection, as Ensamples to the Flock, not only in <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Doctrine,</HI> but in that which speaks the most effectu∣ally and convincing, in <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Conversation,</HI> or <HI>Practice,</HI> giving no just Occasion of Offence to <HI>Jew</HI> nor <HI>Gentile,</HI> nor to the Church of Christ, to speak Evil of Dignities, or the Dignity of our holy Pro∣fession? I say, it highly behoves <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>El∣ders</HI> to be <HI>blameless in all Things,</HI> walking conformably and consistent with the Doctrines of Christ and his Apostles, adorning the Gospel in all Things; other∣wise they are not properly qualified to example, exhort, counsel, caution, reprove and rebuke, with all Authority, the Backsliders, Gainsayers and Un∣faithful in the Church; for whom it hath long been the earnest Travil of my Soul, Night and Day, that they might come to witness Redemption from the Spirit of the World, by which they have been so long held in Bondage: And in a particular and espe∣cial Manner hath my Spirit in great Fervency been engaged, that the <HI>Ministry</HI> might be <HI>blameless;</HI> that those who have a Dispensation of the Gospel com∣mitted to them, might be preserved faithful in every
<PB N="5" REF="010337_0005_0F7E8082A6B9A2A0"/>
Branch of our <HI>Christian</HI> Testimony, kept by the Direction and Leading of the Spirit of Truth in the holy Way of Truth, and out of all Error; that they might act consistent with the Dignity of their high and holy Vocation, forbearing to do any Thing against the Truth, but every Thing for its Promotion and Honour, whether in eating, drink∣ing, cloathing, buying, selling, marrying, or given in Marriage, building Houses, and furnishing the same; that all and every Action of our Lives might glorify God, or at least, in all these Things that we be careful not to dishonour him. In such a Case, I am persuaded the Gospel Power would run and be glorified; Men would say, <HI>God is with us of a Truth;</HI> and the Uncircumcised in Heart and Ear would hear, if Practice and Example spoke more generally in those who think themselves more re∣formed than others; There would be now, as for∣merly, many taking hold of the Skirt of the true <HI>Jew,</HI> saying, <HI>Now we believe;</HI> not because we have heard the Doctrines of the Gospel preached by you, but the powerful Influence of your truly <HI>Christian</HI> Practice we cannot resist; we are now sensible you believe the Truths of the Gospel, for the Work's Sake which accompanies your Faith. In such a Case, the People would not retort as now they do, <HI>Such a one,</HI> say they, <HI>preached to himself this Day.</HI>—Another we hear crying, aye! <HI>So say, so do.</HI>—A Third, look at <HI>the Pride in their Families.</HI>—A Fourth, observe <HI>such and such. Grandeur.</HI>—A Fifth, look at <HI>their Love of the World, and earnest Pursuit of Riches.</HI>—With many more such like Retortions, which proceed from the Mouths of many of the Members of our own Society.</P>
<P>And here let us give a little Attention, and hear the World speak; for neither will they believe our Report: Says one, <HI>Now you</HI> Quakers <HI>have convinced us your Principles are right, you are leaving them</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="010337_0006_0F7E80835C2A6F18"/>
<HI>yourselves: Where's your Contempt of the World? How can you speak against the earnest Pursuit of Riches; for who more earnest to accumulate Wealth than your People? Where's the Self-denial you pretend to? Don't you gratify the Lust of the Eye, and Pride of Life, though plain, yet in rich and costly Silks, and the finest of Linen? Do you call this Self-denial?</HI> And then, <HI>what Time do you take to dress yourselves in your plain Nicety and Exactness? We are not half so long putting on our Finery.</HI> Again, one asked, <HI>How we could pray that the Vanities and Glories of the World, might be stained in the Eyes of the People,</HI> which she heard pray'd for in a Meeting, and when she came out made this Remark; <HI>You both make and sell these Vanities.</HI> Another said, <HI>We have no Scruple about those Things; but how you that have, and yet make and sell them, is a Wonder to us.</HI> Another, purchasing some vain Things, looked with Admiration on the plain Friend that could sell such Things. With many more such Observations on our Inconsistencies in other Things, too numerous to relate.</P>
<P>Observe, <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> how we are reproached now, not for <HI>reforming,</HI> but <HI>conforming</HI> to the World in many Respects; and though there has been so much Labour bestowed to convince the World of our <HI>Christian</HI> Principles, and what great Self-denial they lead to, we can't deny that they have abundant Reason to say as they do of many; <HI>They are contra∣dicting them themselves.</HI> And now, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> per∣mit me to say, while by Practice any of us thus do, whatever our Station be in the Church, whether pub∣lick or private, both Profession and Preaching will be vain; the People it is to be feared, will remain in Unbelief. And I farther add, I do not commu∣nicate these Things to you with any other View, than that of a long wished for Reformation in our poor declining Society; that those by whom Offences come, might no longer offend against the Light, the
<PB N="7" REF="010337_0007_0F7E8084178AE2D0"/>
sacred Rule we profess to walk by, which you know is no less than the <HI>Direction and Leading of the Spirit of God.</HI> And allow me further to say, which I do with Regret, that there should be any Cause for it, Many see and say, that this wished for Reforma∣tion must begin in MINISTERS, ELDERS, RULERS, and all such as appear outwardly in Plainness: The Sons of <HI>Levi,</HI> and others mention'd, must be purify'd: I mean, such of these who have contracted too much of the Dust of the Earth, and Spots of the World; for, in this Sense, the Head is <HI>partially</HI> sick, which is the Cause the Heart of the Faithful faints; and they are greatly straitned till the fiery Baptism is throughly accomplished in such who are but <HI>partially</HI> washed, or at least have been again defiled by turning to, and loving this present World: And on this Occasion the <HI>faithful Ministers</HI> are weeping as between the Porch and the Altar, saying, <HI>Spare the People, O Lord, who were called by thy Name;</HI> and are offering daily the Sacrifice for themselves as well as for the People, fervently petitioning the God of Knowledge to try and search them throughly, and if any Iniquity remain, by his, cleansing Power he would do it away: And that every one who profess the blessed pure Truth, may have not only their Feet, but their Head and Hands throughly purify'd, that they may walk in, Integrity and Equity before the People, as was said of the House of <HI>Levi, My Covenant, saith the Lord, was with him of Life and Peace, Iniquity was not found in his Lips, he walked with me in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from Iniquity:</HI> But when he departed out of the Way, be caused many to, stumble at the Law, which he had been, partial in, and so corrupted the Covenant.</P>
<P>And again, that we might be of <HI>upright Minds</HI> land <HI>sound Judgments,</HI> always remembring that we are to judge for God, and not for Man: that we may <HI>shut our Eyes from seeing of Evil,</HI> which, 'tis to
<PB N="8" REF="010337_0008_0F7E8084D4964380"/>
be feared, some pass by with too gentle, if any, Reproof of it; that we may <HI>stop our Ears from hear∣ing of Blood,</HI> listening to, or by any Means giving Way to the corrupt Reasoning and carnal Argu∣ments of libertine Spirits, who, though they are called of the People of Israel, were as of old, gathered together and combining with the Spirit of <HI>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> against the holy Child <HI>Jesus,</HI> crying out in Effect and Practice, <HI>Slay this Witness that rises up against us and our Deeds.</HI> I say, don't let us countenance this Disposition in any who are crucifying the Lord afresh, though never so near and dear to us; nor encourage those Things which put him to open Shame. And that we may also make our Hands from <HI>holding of Bribes,</HI> ever refusing to be bribed against the Truth, either from our own Hearts Lusts, or from Wives, Chil∣dren, Friends or Relations, remembring, in the Case of <HI>Idolatry</HI> under the Law, <HI>a Man was not to know his nearest of Kin, when acting for God's Honour:</HI> Then the <HI>Idolater</HI> was not spared; but under the more linient Dispensation of the Gospel, the <HI>Idol</HI> only is to be destroyed. And again, let us ever be on our Guard, that we are not bribed with the <HI>flattering Affections</HI> of the People; remembring 'tis not our own Honour, but the Honour of God we are con∣cerned for: And lastly, let us take Care, and keep a double Guard, that we are not bribed by <HI>Worldly Interests</HI> and <HI>Connexions in Trade;</HI> thus reasoning, <HI>If I use plain Dealing with such or such, I shall lose their Custom.</HI> And again, <HI>If I sell not such Merchandize as please the People, I shall have no Trade.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>dearly Beloved,</HI> my Heart's Desire and Prayer to God is, that he would enlighten, more and more, every Eye that may be blinded with the Love of the World, that they may see these Bribes, and refuse this Gain of Oppression, which ever did, and ever will oppress and choak the Seed of the Kingdom;
<PB N="9" REF="010337_0009_0F7E8085D08A7770"/>
but that all may walk righteously, and speak up∣rightly, saying, under any of these Temptations, <HI>How can I do this Thing</HI> (or suffer it in any in my Charge) <HI>which the Light and Truth condemns, and sin against my God, whose holy Spirit I profess to be guided by!</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> let me here say, that what I have written, and the Collection I have made from Friends Writings, will not I am certain hurt the Faithful, and may be of Service to the Unfaith∣ful, to whom I offer them in that Love which has no other View but the Glory of God, and the Edifica∣tion of all in the Love of God; and not for the Discouragement, much less the Destruction of any; but in that Charity which will never fail, is my earnest Petition put up to him who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, that the dispersed in <HI>Judah,</HI> and the scattered of <HI>Israel,</HI> may be by the great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls brought home to the Fold of Eternal Rest and Safety. But I would ever discern and make a Difference between the Precious and the Vile; between that among us that brings Glory to God, and that which manifestly dishonours him, and our own Pretensions. And though I am led to recom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Perusal of these Papers to those in the Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on above mentioned, yet I know of a Certainty; that there are a few Names left among us, who have retained their first Love, a faithful Remnant both of <HI>Ministers, Elders,</HI> and others, scattered up and down among the Tribes, with whom my Soul is nearly united in the Bond of true Affection and Sympathy, who are frequently mourning the Declension of the Church, and in the Words of a faithful Minister, <HI>Their Burden is my Burden, I weep with these that weep, am sorrowful with the Sorrowful; and as the Spirit of Christ is one in all, that which is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f to the Spirit of God in any, I am burdened with them, and do bear a Part of their</HI>

<HI>Grief:</HI> And these are sometimes discouraged, seeing the Rubbish is so mountainous, and the faithful Labourers so few, they are crying to the Lord, that he would be pleased to qualify and send forth more Labourers, to remove the Rubbish, in order to rebuild the Walls of our <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and once again set up her Gates on the old Foundation, Christ, his Apostles and Prophets, Jesus himself being the chief Corner-stone; which Foundation only stands sure and immovable; That if possible the latter House may excel in Beauty and Comliness the former; for though there can be no other Foundation for the Church of Christ to build on, yet as People keep a single Eye to God's Glory, a greater Degree of Light, in which new Things would be discovered, would shine forth in a greater Degree of Self-abase∣ment, and more perfect Self-denial, and so would our <HI>Zion</HI> yet become the Example, and then the Praise of the whole Earth, and remain an eternal Excellence to the Praise and Glory of God, who hath called us to Virtue, which as we come up in the Practice thereof, we shall be made Inheritors of that Peace and Glory which fadeth not away.

a Fast at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> that the Judgments of God might be removed, and there was among Friends different Minds about owning or not owning of it; but after a Time of deep Exercise, the Lord God by his eternal Word raised my Zeal, and I did in his Power smite against all such Mockeries; and then in the heavenly Revelation shewed me, that it was to be witnessed against by all that stood in the Testimony of God; and that those who would weaken the Spirits of any, in their Testi∣mony, it was shewed me plainly from the Lord, they would draw a Vail over themselves; and in a cowerdly underly Spirit, by the corrupted fallen Wisdom, would put the Candle, which God had lighted, under a Bushel, until at last it would be put out: So that we, like other Professors, at last would be led to yield to any Thing rather than suffer; and so then the Offence of the Cross might cease.</Q></P>

Where∣fore my Counsel is, that they learn the Tongues especially from <HI>Christians,</HI> without the Lies, Fa∣bles, Follies, Vanities, Whoredoms, Lusts, Pride, Revenge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Heathens;</HI> especially seeing, neither their Words nor Phrases are meet for <HI>Christians</HI> to take into their Mouths. And most necessary it is, that <HI>Christians</HI> should forget the Names of their Gods and Muses, and all their fabulous Inventions, and let them go to Satan from whence they came.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Light shining out of Darkness.</HI> <Q>The <HI>Christians</HI> in the primitive Times lived excluded from all Ho∣nours and Magistry, and did neglect those Studies necessary for civil Trusts and Employments; and because Sophisters and Philosophers were the prin∣cipal Enemies of <HI>Christianity,</HI> they were disgusted at all Philosophy, and severely censured all manner of florid and polite Learning: They condemned Tragedies and Comedies, and other poetical Wri∣tings, being the main Part of human Learning, and thinking they did not conduce to solid Know∣ledge, being full of Wantonness and Obscenity, as also Promptuaries of fabulous Idolatries. Hence it was, <HI>Tertullian</HI> thinks, Schoolmasters, and other Professors of Learning, to be guilty of a manifold Idolatry, whose Business it was to explain the Names, Genealogies, fabulous Acts and Elogies of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Gods. Generally the Believers in those Days harboured a very bad esteem for worldly Learning: Whence it is clear, secular Learning was endangered in those Times of the ancient <HI>Christians,</HI> who was so much the more provoked thereunto, because the <HI>Gentiles</HI> did con∣tinually
<PB N="15" REF="010337_0015_0F7E808AB4C9FA20"/>
upbraid them, That they were a Sort of <HI>Idiots</HI> and <HI>illiterate Persons;</HI> that their Teachers were rude and ignorant <HI>Combers</HI> of <HI>Wool, Coblers</HI> and <HI>Fullers.</HI> The <HI>Christians</HI> reply'd, That the Learning in which they did so pride themselves, was an useless Thing, no Ways advantageous to Salvation; nay, that it did estrange the wise Men of this World from the Ways of God, and was a great Occasion of their Ruin. Hence it was that <HI>Celsus</HI> upbraided them as a Communion of <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Slaves.</HI> The <HI>Gentiles</HI> also objected unto the <HI>Chris∣tians</HI> their rude Stile, harsh Language, calling them <HI>Rusticks</HI> and <HI>Clowns.</HI> Clemens enjoyned <HI>Chris∣tians</HI> to abstain from all Books of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> for what have you to do with strange Discourses, or Laws, or false Prophets, who seduce weak Men from the Truth? Bishops were also forbid to read <HI>Heathen</HI> Authors; out of the <HI>Bucolicks</HI> they sing Love Verses, they peruse <HI>Virgil,</HI> &amp;c. and what is a Sin of enforced Necessity in Children, becomes their Delight. If you say, <HI>there is not now any Danger of reading heathenish Books,</HI> you give but the same Reason <HI>Bellermin</HI> does, which is refuted by <HI>Lawrentius,</HI> since the Errors of the <HI>Heathen</HI> are not more manifest now than of old, nor Men more fixed and constant. <HI>Machivel</HI> says, the first Pro∣moters and Founders of <HI>Christianity</HI> were so assi∣duous and deligent in extirpating the Superstitions of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they commanded all Poets and Historians, which contained any Thing of that Nature, to be burn'd: They did not spare <HI>Plautus, Martial</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> and for the same Reason as they burn'd some of the <HI>Latin</HI> Authors, did they destroy the <HI>Greek,</HI> because they were lascivious. <HI>Bellonius,</HI> a great Traveller, says, when he came to Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> which is the greatest of any of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, he did not find there among reli∣gious Persons (no nor in all <HI>Greece</HI>) one Man that

was learned. In their Libraries they had several Manuscripts of Divinity, but no Poets, Historians or Philosophers. Yet thou art to understand, <HI>Reader,</HI> that the <HI>Greek</HI> Church is owned as a true <HI>Christian</HI> Church, and highly magnified by <HI>Pro∣testants;</HI> yet neither they, nor the <HI>Picards,</HI> or <HI>Wal∣denses,</HI> did value Learning: So far were they from esteeming it as a Prop of true Religion.</Q></P>
<P>Lawson's <HI>Works.</HI> <Q>Many Since the Apostles Days have borne Testimony against teaching <HI>Heathen</HI> Authors in <HI>Christian</HI> Schools; nay, a <HI>Heathen, Plato,</HI> blames the first Education of Youth as de∣structive, in Reading the feigned, Comical and tragical Inventions of Poets.—<HI>A. Sympson</HI> says, There is much precious Time spent in prophane Stories and lascivious Poems.—The. <HI>Romans</HI> brought in <HI>Heathen</HI> Poets and Comedies into Schools; which to the Shame and corrupting this Nation are yet continued: Though in the Days of Queen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Queen enjoin'd, that all School-masters should accustom their Scholars reverently to learn such Sen∣tences of Scripture, as should be most expedient to induce them to Godliness.</NOTE> <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Lords of her privy Coun∣cil sent Letters to her Commissioners in Causes Ecclesiastical, requiring them to write Letters to all the Bishops of this Realm, and require them to give Commandment, that in all Grammar and! Free-schools, <HI>Christopher Ocland</HI>'s Book should be taught in Place of some Heathen Poets; saying, The Youth of this Realm receive rather Infection in Manners, than Advancement in Virtue from the <HI>Heathen</HI> Poets taught in Schools.—Bishop <HI>Wilkins</HI> says, Men have neglected sound, savory and use∣ful Matter, the Quintessence of Learning, and have devoted themselves to an Excess of fine

<P><HI>"Socrates Scholasticus</HI> saith, That for <HI>Christians</HI> to imbibe the Learning of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> can no ways advantage their Religion, for it is not without Danger, because it teacheth Plurality of Gods.</P>
<P>"Abstain from all <HI>Heathen</HI> Books, says <HI>Clemens;</HI> for what is wanting in the Law of God, that thou should apply thy Mind to <HI>Heathen</HI> Fables? <HI>Clement</HI> adds, The Ancients deny'd these Things; but now through a Pretence of instructing Youth, the Knowledge of these Things is so incorporated in tender and simple Minds, as that the same can scarce by any Ways or Means be rid out of them.</P>

But you, call'd <HI>Christians,</HI> must befa in to have <HI>Heathen</HI> Books to teach your Children in your Schools, whereby the Children must learn the <HI>Heathen</HI> Words. What <HI>Christians!</HI> what <HI>Gospel-Professors!</HI> are not you to teach your Children the Gospel, as the <HI>Jews</HI> were to teach their Children the Law? and train them up in that, and break down all the <HI>Heathen</HI> Books? Must the <HI>Heathen</HI> help you? must you be Borrowers of the <HI>Hea∣thens?</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> were not to be Borrowers, and are you Borrowers of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Books? Did not the <HI>Christians</HI> burn Abundance of Books when they were converted? And are you gathering up <HI>Heathen</HI> Books since the Days of the Apostles, (in the Apostacy) as <HI>Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Terence, Plautes, Cicero,</HI> and others, which you extol in your Schools? If you will teach your Children other Tongues, translate the Scriptures into other Tongues to teach their Children, and make an End of all <HI>Heathenish</HI> Books which corrupt the Earth, and do not teach your Children the Way of the <HI>Heathen</HI> by teaching their Books: And, <HI>con∣tinues</HI> George Fox, we have drawn some few Ex∣amples forth of the School Books, to shew the Reader whether such Words are fit to be taught in Schools." <HI>See the latter End of the</HI> Battledoor.</P>

<P>Fox<HI>'s Acts and Monuments,</HI> pag. 23. <HI>where Bishop</HI> Ridley <HI>speaks after this Manner;</HI> "Conscience doth move me to fear, left the Lightness of my Family shall be laid to my Charge, for lack of more earnest and diligent Instruction which should have been done.—I bless God that he hath given me to see this Fault, and to lament it from the Bottom of my Heart. — I would that I esteem nothing available for me, which will not further the Glory of God; for whosoever wittingly neglecteth to clear his Conscience, can't have Peace with God.—Conscious of this, that we Pastors, many of us, are too cold, and bare too much with the wicked World so on every Side, and of every Sort, we provoke God's Anger."</P>

<P><HI>And it may not be amiss here to add,</HI> That it is a Duty incumbent on Parents, Tutors, Schoolmasters and Mistresses, carefully to watch the Passions and Dispositions of Youth, [and to provide some sober Person to attend them in their vacant Hours, to prevent any Sports which may have the evil Ten∣dency before mentioned] and as much as possible
<PB N="26" REF="010337_0026_0F7E809884B0AB18"/>
to correct or amend the evil Inclinations which may appear in any, by Methods suiting the Tempers of the Children; and as <HI>ceasing to do evil,</HI> is but one Part of the Injunction delivered by the Prophet in the Name of the Lord, it is indispensibly necessary they should be taught <HI>to do well:</HI> That they be carefully instructed in a Manner suitable to their Age and Capacities, in the Principles of our <HI>Christian</HI> Profession, as well as reading such Parts of the holy Scriptures and Friends Writings, as their Under∣standings might take in, when a little explained by the Instructor. And as proper Habits, as well as suitable Nurture, may have some good Influence on their future Life and Practice, it is but agreeable to our Profession, as well as to the repeated Advices of our Friends, to recommend to Parents, School-masters and Mistresses, that they spare a little Time in some seasonable Part of each Day, to sit with their Families in a religious Silence; if it were only to think on the Name of the Lord, it would be comely and of good Report; for it don't seem to, be so, when many are behind the formal Worship∣pers of this World in Family Acknowledgements of God, who is to be enquired of for Help and Asist∣ance, not only once a Week, but, as the <HI>Jews</HI> outward, so the <HI>Jew</HI> inward, is to offer the daily Sacrifice. Well, I say, if this be done by us in In∣tegrity and Uprightness of Heart, the Result of the Love of God, the Advantages arising from such a Practice will not only be certain but great, as the Prophet assures us; and when done in Simplicity, while we may be thus musing the Fire may kindle, and the warming Beams of God's Love may shed its, enlivening Influence on Elders and Youth; to whom our Memorials of God's Mercies might be produced. I am sensible, if we more generally lived in a due Sense of our Dependency on the Lord, and of his Benefits to our Souls and Bodies, past and present,

<P>IN the Feeling of that Love that hath visited our Hearts, do I desire to salute you: Since I had the Occasion to see some of your Faces, you have been often before me in that which desires the Prosperity of the good and holy Work of Truth, that our God in his Mercy hath begun in and amongst us, and honoured us to be as a first Fruits unto himself: Therein I feel this Concern increaseth, so that I could not safely forbear, but in Obedience to that which raised this Concern in my Heart, do I write unto you as followeth:</P>
<P>Since the Lord our God hath been pleased to take from among us many of our ancient Brethren and Sisters in the Truth, who had a great Concern on them for the going on of this Work in the Purity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, let us that are behind be carful of the Work of God in us, and amongst us; that we may stand up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Faithfulness of Heart in their Rooms, in this our Day of God's Love to us. O you Elders in the Truth, and Parents of Children, my Call is unto you; stand up in the Authority that God giveth you, in the Meekness and Wisdom of God, and in your Places acquit yourselves as becomes you, in Obedience to God, and therein answer your Duty towards your Youth. We know that God's Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> near, that giveth to know, and enableth us to answer our Duty in all Things, as we keep in Sub∣jection

our Minds to it; so let us all be careful in our Places to keep to the Power, that therein we may be good Examples to one another, laying aside, and keeping out of all [<HI>Superfluity</HI> or] Superfluous Things; for we know that in Mercy we were brought in at the right Door: And there was no less called for at our Hands, in our first Visitation of God's Love and Light, than to come out of all Superfluity. So in the same pure Way must we hold on, and have weighty Care to train up our Youth therein, to go on with us in it, that we and ours may be given up to the Lord, (who hath visited us in his Love) for we and ours are the Offering due to our God, and he requires it of us. O my <HI>dear Friends,</HI> let no less be our Offering to him <HI>than our All.</HI> This is the present Breathing of my Heart before him. For what is or can be our Children to us, but as they are in the Truth, that brings forth a sober and serious Conversation in it? Therein only can they be a Comfort to the upright in Heart. So let this Con∣cern be more and more weighty on us Parents, School-masters and School-mistresses. I feel it in my Heart in that which desireth I may be kept in the Concern myself, and in Obedience to that Power that raiseth this good and weighty Concern, <HI>my Call is unto you all</HI> who have the Occasion to be concern'd in this weighty Work of bringing up Youth; have a special Care that you answer your Duty in it, in the first Place to God, and next to the Youth you are con∣cerned with. I feel there is a great Matter of this Work lieth in your Hands, Parents, School-masters and School-mistresses: O you have Need to know and keep your Watch continually, in the pure Spring of Life and Wisdom, that you may know, and make a thorough Difference between the <HI>needful</HI> and the <HI>needless</HI> and superfluous Things, either in Meats, Drinks and <HI>Apparel; and in that which ye teach them for the Employment of their Hands.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="010337_0029_0F7E809A907BC9A0"/>
I charge you in the Sight of that Power that searches the Depths of our Hearts, <HI>that you neither teach, allow nor suffer the superfluous or vain Thing amongst you:</HI> For your Families ought to be as young Nurseries to the Lord, and then your Endeavours with them shall be known for Good, in the Fami∣lies they fall to be in.</P>
<P>And O you Youth! how shall I ease my Mind concerning you! for your Sakes, and on your Be∣half, am I often as one who hath her Hands upon her Loins, and as in Pain for your Sakes, that you may more and more come forth out of that which hinders you from serving God in your Generation in a sin∣cere Heart; for a Profession alone will not do, or serve. Therefore arise in Uprightness of Heart, and shake yourselves from that which hinders and disor∣ders the Mind as to its following God in Obedience: And, as wise Virgins in a chaste Mind to God, let us both Old and Young wait more and more to feel in his Virtue and Power our Light increased, and we, as Lamps, fill'd with the Oil of the Gospel; that therein we may know a putting on of the Wedding Garment of true Holiness, which will make us ac∣ceptable in the Sight of our God. And as the Mind comes weightily to be concern'd that it may be so with us, it will make it easy to us to part with all the superfluous Part, either in Food or Raiment, and in every step of our Conversation or Converse: Yea the superfluous Words also must be laid aside; for in the Resignation that is known in the silence of Mind before the Searcher of Hearts, is our Preservation witnessed. O that those of us, both Old and Young, that in Mercy are made sensible that it is so, may be in a weighty Care to hold on in the daily Practice and inward Enjoyment of it, and that therein we may bring forth the Godly Conversation, in which we may be serviceable to one another, and may recom∣mend the good Way of Truth to the Beholders of
<PB N="30" REF="010337_0030_0F7E809FE3B66CF0"/>
our Conversation in it, is the earnest Breathing of my Heart, who desires the Prosperity and going on of this blessed Work, both in the Particular and in the General, in which I desire to remain your Friend and Sister in the Truth,</P>

<HEAD>TESTIMONIES of FRIENDS against superfluous Needle-work, of various Colours and Figures, call'd Tent-work and Cut-works, laced Seams, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ANNE Whitehead,</HI> Wife of <HI>George Whitehead,</HI> one of the first convinced Women Friends at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and, if I mistake not, the first Woman that appear'd in publick Testimony for Truth; she no sooner had a sight of the Pearl of great Price, and found she must sell all for the Purchase of it, but she put away all that was delightful to her; and though her own Works, and highly priz'd by others, yet, lest there should be an Idol in them, they were all thrown into the Fire by her; yea, all that she thought would stop or hinder her walking in the narrow Way. She pray'd earnestly for Friends Children, that <HI>they might fear the Lord, and be pre∣served from the Spirit of Pride;</HI> which was the Sub∣stance of the last Testimony before her Death, on seeing some Friends Children come into Meeting dress'd in the Mode of the Times.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph Featherstone,</HI> on his Death-bed, desired his Wife to bring up his Children in the Nurture and
<PB N="31" REF="010337_0031_0F7E80A17A556D08"/>
Fear of the Lord, and educate them in the plain de∣cent Parts that belong to a Woman: but upon a needless Seam, or any Thing superfluous, no not to lift her Hand to do it; <HI>For that,</HI> said he, <HI>will bring Dishonour to the blessed Truth, and burden the single hearted, and draw the Minds of Youth after Vanity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth Ashbridge,</HI> of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> kept a School, and would not teach nor suffer Superfluity, as Cut∣works, laced Seams in Child-bed Linnen, only Marking and Plain-work; neither would she let Friends Children dress in the Fashions of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Anne Gerrard,</HI> a publick Friend at <HI>London,</HI> her Testimony against Superfluity: <HI>I adorn'd,</HI> says she, <HI>the Clothes of my first Child with Superfluity and fine Works;</HI> and shewing them to my Mother, she was griev'd, and said, Anne, <HI>this is the Finery, but not the Plainness of Friends.</HI> These Words of my Mo∣ther made such an Impression on my Mind, that I never had any more Superfluity on my Child-bed Linen.</P>
<P>A Friend on her Dying-bed, which was in Child-birth, call'd to have the Child-bed Basket remov'd: <HI>Take it away,</HI> said she, <HI>for there is Abundance of Su∣perfluity and needless Work in it, and though I did not do it, I caus'd it to be done, and now 'tis a Burden to my Mind.</HI></P>
<P>Friend <HI>H—</HI>'s Grandmother, a School-mistress, could not teach Works of divers Colours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but Plain work.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy Bradley</HI>'s Mother, on her Death-bed left a Charge, <HI>her Daughter should not learn fine Works, but Plain-work and Marking.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sarah Morris.</HI> Her Mother would not suffer her Children to learn fine Needle-works of various Colours, Lace-work nor Cut-works.</P>
<P>A certain Freind said, <HI>She once did a pretty deal of fine Needle-works of many Colours; but when Truth prevail'd in her Mind, she gave them away;</HI> and since
<PB N="32" REF="010337_0032_0F7E80A22315CFC0"/>
said, <HI>She wish'd she had not; for if she had them again, she believ'd she should burn them.</HI></P>
<P>I visited <HI>Edmondsbury</HI> Boarding-school, and testi∣fied against the Works taught in it, such as <HI>Tent∣stitch, Cut-works,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Esther Morris,</HI> in early Time of Friends, had a Concern to educate Children, and propos'd to Friends to teach their Daughters, because of the Danger of mixing with the Worlds Children in Schools: She succeeded, and taught only Plain-works, Marking, Knitting and Reading.</P>
<P><HI>Simeon Warner</HI> would not suffer his Grand-daugh∣ter to learn fine Needdle-works, as she told me.</P>
<P><HI>George Fox</HI> tells us, he had a Concern to advise setting up a Girls School; <HI>Children to be taught,</HI> says he, <HI>civil Things:</HI> That is, as some Minutes of Friends explain the Word <HI>(plain Things) and Things useful in the Creation;</HI> Journal, Vol. 2. pag. 105. The same Author warns against Pride in these Words; <HI>do not nourish the Lust of the Eye in your Families, for if you do, you nourish that which is not of God.</HI> Doctrinals, pag. 828.</P>
<P><HI>William Penn,</HI> speaking of Apparel and other external Things, says, <HI>A few plain, decent or comely Things, serve a</HI> Christian <HI>Life; 'tis Lust, Pride and Covetousness, thrust People on such Follies.</HI> No Cross <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—The same Author, speaking of modern Edu∣cation, says, <HI>The Minds of Youth are</HI> allur'd <HI>to visible Things that perish, and instead of remembring their Creator, are taken up with Toys and Fopperies.—If thou art clean and warm, 'tis sufficient; more-does but rob the Poor, and please the Wanton.</HI> Maxims, pag. 26. Again the same Author tells his Wife, in his Advice to her and his Children, <HI>I had rather,</HI> says he, <HI>have my Children homely than finely bred; be plain in Clothes, Furniture and Food.—Be clean, and then the Coarser the better; the rest is but Folly and a Snare.—Spare not Cost for my Children's Learning, but let it be useful

Learning, such as is consistent with Truth and Godliness. Let my Children be</HI> Husbandmen <HI>and</HI> Housewives. <HI>'Tis industrious, healthy and honest, and a good Exam∣ple, like</HI> Abraham <HI>and the holy Ancients that pleased God, and obtained a good Report, and diverts from being taken up with the vain Arts and Inventions of a luxurious World.—Rather keep a Person in the House than send them to Schools, unless they are very well re∣gulated, which is I fear hard to find.—Above all, take Care to preserve their native Innocence and Modesty, which in publick Schools, for a little they get is mostly lost, for in such Places the first evil Impressions are received.</HI></P>
<P>Charles Marshall's <HI>Epistle to Friends,</HI> pag. 12, 13. <HI>of his Works.</HI> Friends, it is upon me to leave this as the Counsel of the Lord upon all that have the Tuition of Children or Youth; that always in their Families they wait to feel the daily arising of God's Power, and in that to labour and keep down all Sin and Iniquity in your Families, and feel the Ability to reach the Witness of God in Children and Ser∣vants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that all may be kept sweet and clean in God's Fear, Dread and Awe, out of all needless Discourse, vain Words and foolish jesting. Let your Words be few, ministring Grace to the Hear∣ers.—And, <HI>Friends,</HI> 'tis likewise upon me to warn all to be careful, that neither you nor your Families run into Superfluities in Meat, Drink and Apparel, or into the proud offensive Garbs of the World; but in all Things let us keep our first Fear, Dread and Awe, that in none of these Things we may make Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the sinful Lusts thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Christian Barclay,</HI> Wife of <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> the <HI>Aplogist,</HI> whose Epistle is before annex'd to these Testimonies: <HI>I had a Concern,</HI> says she, <HI>to speak to a School-mistress, a Friend, of the Inconsistency of teach∣ing these Works, I have mentioned, in Friends Schools;</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="010337_0034_0F7E80A3DFE86D30"/>
and she signified, on her first teaching them, she was very uneasy in her Mind; but taking Counsel of one she prefer'd in Judgment, she was advis'd to continue to teach them. I don't at all know the Friend or Friends who thus counsel'd her, but it appears to me to be a Case parallel with that we read of, where the old Prophet turn'd the Younger out of the Way, and caused him to disobey the Lord.</P>
<P>I visited another Boarding-school, and spoke to the School-mistress on the same Subject; she allow'd it was not agreeable to Truth to teach these Things in Friends Schools; but alledged, their Parents would have them so taught. But ought not faithful Friends to make a stand against them, and thus query, <HI>How can I assist in making Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the sinful Lusts thereof?</HI> This faithful Testimony would have a Tendency to open the Eye which the God of this World hath blinded in Pa∣rents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I am inform'd, the Schools of some, called Friends, make for Sale Childbed Linen with laced Seams, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Value of five, six or seven Guineas a Suit. O that all would consider and see they are helping on the Excesses and Luxury of <HI>Babylon;</HI> consider, I say, and dread and fear her miserable Doom, left any Professor of the Truth of God partake with her in her Plagues; for the more delicately, costly and vainly she lives, the more will she be punish'd.</P>

<P>The Testimony, on her Death-bed, of a Woman Friend, who apparel'd herself in Plainness, and did not follow Fashions of the World; but loved nice, though plain Things.

<HI>Extract from</HI> A.

<P><HI>Origen,</HI> speaking of those Words, <HI>Silver and Gold I have none;</HI> said, "Behold the Riches of those who are Priests of Christ; but let us quickly apply these Things to ourselves, who are prohibited by the Law or Christ, (if we have any Regard there∣to) to have Possessions in the Country, and Houses in the City; no, not to multiply Coats nor Money; but if we have Food and Raiment let us be there∣with content." <HI>Dissertation on Tithes.</HI></P>
<P>Ambrose Rigg<HI>'s Life,</HI> pag. 236. "That Estate that is got, either with the rending, or Hazard of rending another's, is neither honestly got, nor can be blessed.—'Tis when the Enemy gets in, and works in his Mind, and he begins to think of a higher Trade, and finer House, and to live more at Ease and Pleasure in the World, and then con∣trives how he may borrow of this and the other; and when accomplished according to his Desire, then he begins to undertake great Things, and get into a fine House, and gather rich Furniture and Goods together, launching presently into the strong Torrent of a great Trade, and then make a great Shew beyond what really he is, which is Dishonesty; and if he accomplish his intended Purpose to raise himself in the World, 'tis with

<P><HI>Epistle from the General-meeting in</HI> Dublin, 1671. "As there was rather a going back by many into the dark Customs and never-settled Fashions, into the Liberty and Spirit of the World, both in Ap∣parel and superfluous adorning of Houses with those Things which at best do but feed the Lust of the Eye, and therefore must needs minister unto Vanity, and not adorn the Gospel of Christ; the Lord hath put it into our Hearts to write these Lines."</P>

<P>Ambrose Rigg<HI>'s Epistle to Friends.</HI> "Whereas the great and wise God having made Man accord∣ing to his good Pleasure, and hath bestowed a Quantity of Hair to keep them warm, some of one Colour and some of another, such a Colour as will satisfy an humble Mind; and if any hath not a sufficient Quantity, or through Sickness or Casualty loses his Hair, a suitable and modest Supply may be suitable, and no Offence to God
<PB N="41" REF="010337_0041_0F7E80A926D9C530"/>
and good Men; this Supply of Hair being used till natural Hair grow again, and then be well laid aside.—But if Pride, or without any just Occasion, do cut it off, because it is not fashionable or modish, or that it don't curl enough, or is not of such a Colour as they like; this is not right in the Sight of God, and an evident Token that divine Wisdom is slighted and undervalued, by those who are not contented with such Sort and Colour of Hair as he hath seen sit to bestow, as if they would alter the Work of Providence, and mend what God hath made.—I felt a Concern on my Spirit from the Lord to give a short Testi∣mony against this Excess, seeing, to my Sorrow, many both old and young run into unnecessary Wigs, and have found that it hath given Occa∣sion of Offence in divers Places."</P>
<P>And I here add, That Truth is one in all, and it calls to Humility and Self-denial in all, as appears by divers Testimonies formerly given forth against Pride, by several Members of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> And I find in the Articles of Visitation, when the Bishops visited their Diocesses, they were to enquire among other Things, <HI>Whether the Mini∣sters were sober, and examplary in their Hair?</HI> And one (call'd a dignify'd one) amongst them, writes thus: "There have been Books written about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lawfulness or Unlawfulness of Men's wearing long Hair, the Substance of which were too much to transcribe here.—That which seems commended to us as the Will of God in this Matter is, That Men and Women should so order their Hair, as to preserve the Distinction of Sexes, (as well as in their Clothes) that they should not wear it curled or tricked up about their Heads, as the Women; which speaks too much of an unmanly esseminate Temper; and much more, it was what became not <HI>Christians.</HI> And if this be forbidden Men, as
<PB N="42" REF="010337_0042_0F7E80A9A1374BC0"/>
to the Use of their own Hair, they stand concern'd to consider, whether it be lawful thus to adorn themselves with the Hair of other Men and Wo∣men."</P>
<P>And here let the Prophet and Apostles have place; and I would, <HI>Brethren,</HI> it might have place in your Hearts also.—And first, the Women's well-set Hair is produc'd by the Prophet as a Mark of their Pride; and among their Implements serving the Purposes of Pride, is enumerated the <HI>Crispin∣pins;</HI> which an old Translation says, were <HI>Pins to curl their Hair, or to keep it in that Form.</HI> And next, let us give Attention to the Apostle's Advice, which plainly amounts to a Prohibition; <HI>that</HI> Christian <HI>Women ought not to plait or broider their Hair;</HI> which the Bishop's Bible calls <HI>curling the Hair:</HI> Forbid, I say, as it was not becoming the Humility, Solidity and Gravity of Women professing Godliness, no more than wearing Gold and costly Array: And here we may observe Religion concern'd in these Things, tho' many deny it.—I might here enlarge on this Subject, but for Brevity's Sake I shall only recommend to you, <HI>Brethren,</HI> to consider and judge of this Matter yourselves; judge ye then: Does all this well-set and curled Hair you adorn yourselves with, become Men professing Godliness, yea, the highest Degree thereof, <HI>Perfection?</HI> Again, does the Hair of a Youth of seventeen Years answer the Appearance we should see in Seventy? And if Necessity is pleaded, why must Men have borrowed Hair so different from their natural Covering? which not only may differ in Colour, but in its lank, mean and unpleasant Form.—Well, is the Time come, or approaching, wherein the Children is to teach the Fathers? Instead of the Fathers, must we look to the Children, to be made Princes in all the Earth, to give Laws and Example to Mankind? O beloved <HI>Brethren,</HI> if any are out of your Places in this Matter, resume your

Dignity, be Princes in your own Hearts, by the Power of him by whom Kings reign: Search out the Law and the Testimony, which too many have violated, let us be governed strictly by it ourselves; then shall we every one of all Stations be qualified to execute the Laws of God in our Families, in Equity, Truth and Righteousness.</P>
<P><HI>Preface to</HI> William Crouch<HI>'s Works.</HI> pag. 12. "As to the Things of this World, he esteem'd them, as they are in themselves, perishing Enjoyments, and therefore placed not his Affections on them; he looked not on himself as a Proprietor, but a Steward of them; so he was a Benefactor to some of all Opinions, counting that Person his Neigh∣bour that stood in Need of his Bounty, declaring the Love of Money the Root of all Evil, say∣ing, Covetousness is a Sin, which wise Men in all Ages condemn, yet most Men have been more or less in Love with it. That Covetousness is a Sin, yea, a grievous Sin, who is there that denies it? But then the Distinctions about it, the Apolo∣gies and Excuse made for it are so many, and so subtilly contrived, that tho' no Sin is so general and apparent, yet there are very few among the vast Number of Delinquents, that will acknow∣ledge themselves guilty.—He made such a De∣tection of it, that notwithstanding all the Cunning of its Advocates and Abettors, and the various fair Colours they put upon it, 'tis still whatever it was, an odious Monster in the Sight of God and good Men, <HI>a complicated Evil, that carries in its Bowels the Seeds of all Iniquity." See his Treatise on the</HI> enormous Sin of Covetousness detected.—<HI>"We read not of any good Man,</HI> says he, <HI>in all the History of Scripture, or of the primitive Times, that was covetous, and it is a Shame that any that do now pretend to the</HI> Christian <HI>Religion should degene∣rate.</HI> He was clear himself in this Matter, as
<PB N="44" REF="010337_0044_0F7E80AB795FD9D8"/>
credible Persons, who knew him, unanimously agree, that his Treasure was in Heaven; the Treasures of the World he put no Value on them any further than to be his Servants for necessary Uses, and for charitable Acts towards others, for even Strangers in Distress went not empty handed from his Gate; he visited the Fatherless and Widow, and kept himself unspotted from the World; he did Justice towards all Men; 'tis one of the first Lessons Truth teaches her Disciples. Now as doing justly or righteously is a certain Proof of being born of God, so 'tis in vain for any Man to conceit he is so born, in whom the Fruits of Equity or Righteousness are not conspi∣cuous; and whosoever Acts as a new Creature, and feels a Necessity upon him to keep his Word, perform his lawful Contracts, pay his just Debts, and do to all Men as they would have them do to him.—This was the Rule this Friend walked by, and was blessed in his Deeds."</P>
<P>Rutty<HI>'s History of Friends in</HI> Ireland, <HI>pag.</HI> 199. "When the Fear of God prevailed in our Hearts, and we hated Pride and Covetousness, then were we ready to answer Christ Jesus our Captain, that called us to follow him in a spiritual Warfare, under the discipline of the daily Cross and Self-denial; then the Things of this World were of small Value to us, so that we might win Christ; and the goodliest Things of this World were of small Value, and were not near us, so that we might be near the Lord; and the Lord's Truth outballanced all the World, even the most glori∣ous Part of it.—Then great Trading was a Bur∣den, great Concerns a great Trouble; all need∣less Things, fine Houses, rich Furniture, and gaudy Apparel was an Eye-sore; our Eye being single to the Lord, and the Inshining of his Light in our Hearts, which gave us the Sight of the
<PB N="45" REF="010337_0045_0F7E80ABF04EAF18"/>
Knowledge of the Glory of God, which so affected our Minds, that it stained the Glory of all earthly Things, and they bore no Mastery with us, either in Dwelling, Eating, Drinking, Buying, Selling, Marrying, or giving in Marriage; the Lord was the Object of our Eye, and we were all humble and low before him, and Self of small Reputation; Ministers and Elders all in such Cases walking as good Examples, that the Flock might follow their Footsteps, as they follow'd Christ in the daily Cross; and this answer'd the Lord's Witness in all Consciences, and gave us great Credit among Men, till there came a Spirit among us, that began to look back into the World, and traded with the Credit which was not of their own purchasing; striving to be great in the Riches and Possessions of the World: And then great fair Buildings in City and Country, fine and fashionable Furniture, and Apparel equi∣valent, with dainty and voluptuous Provisions, rich Matches in Marriages, excessive customary uncomely smoaking Tobacco, under Colour of lawful and serviceable, far wide from the Foot∣steps of the Ministers and Elders the Lord raised up and sent forth in his Work and Service at the Beginning, and far short of the Example our Lord and Master Jesus Christ left us, when he was tempted in the Wilderness with the Offer of all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them, and he despised them; and <HI>Moses,</HI> that re∣fused to be called the Son of <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s Daughter, but rather chose Affliction with the Lord's People, having a Regard to the Recompence of Reward. And the holy Apostle writes to the Church of Christ, both Fathers, young Men and Children, and advises against the Love of the World, and the Fashions thereof: And it is working, as the old Leaven, at this very Time, to corrupt the
<PB N="46" REF="010337_0046_0F7E80AC9E8A4878"/>
Heritage of God, and to fill it with Briars, Thorns, Thistles and Tares, and the Grapes of the Earth, to make the Lord reject it, and lay it waste. But the Lord of our Mercies is lifting up the Standard of his Spirit against the Enemy in the Hearts of many, to stand in the Gap which this floating, high, worldly, libertine Spirit hath made, that is gone from the Footsteps of them that followed Christ as at first, and knew him to keep them within his Bounds; and not their own Will and Time to lay hold on Presen∣tations and Opportunities that may offer to get Riches, which many have had and refused for Truth's Sake, and the Lord hath accepted it as an Offering, and rewarded to their great Comfort, and the Praise of his great Name."</P>
<P>On the foregoing Page we may observe, that with the Declension so much lamented, came in a Desire of <HI>rich Matches in Marriages,</HI> which occasioned many Advices from Yearly and other Meetings, to Parents who have Children to dispose of in Marriage, not to make their first Care to obtain large Portions for their Children, and Settlements of Marriage; but rather careful that their Children be joined in Marriage with Persons of religious Inclinations, suitable Dispositions, Temper, Sobriety of Manners, and Diligence.—And is not this Advice necessary at this very Day to Ministers and Elders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> some of whom, it is to be feared, make their first Motive of their Change of Life, the Worldly Possession of the Party they address; tho' in many other Respects, as above mentioned, instead of being equally yoaked and Help-meets for their Furtherance in Religion, they become Snares, and perhaps cause them also to worship their strange Gods, as did the Wives of one of old, once greatly favoured of the Lord.</P>
<P>Rutty<HI>'s History of Friends,</HI> &amp;c. "After the Trou∣bles in <HI>Ireland,</HI> succeeded a Time of great Plenty;
<PB N="47" REF="010337_0047_0F7E80AD61DACF20"/>
and as the Time of great Losses had been experi∣enced, before the Time of great Riches came on, and many eagerly pursued them, which proved very injurious upon several Accounts, especially to Friends Children, who perceiving their Parents Fulness, rely'd on them, and grew conceited and finical, many giving way to Idleness, and many Parents indulging them, and gratifying the vain Mind that goes after the Fashions of the World; and for want of timely Care, some grew so hardy, that their Parents could not deal with them; and these Things added great Exercise to the Sincere, and great Endeavours were used to put a Stop to this eager Pursuit after the Things of this World.—And from many Men and Womens Meetings, Admonitions, Exhor∣tations and Warnings, were sent forth to the Body of Friends, to keep to the Limits of Truth. <HI>And further, continues the History,</HI> "This Concern of the Elders is no less a standing Evidence of their true Wisdom and Forecast, with Regard to the Preservation of succeeding Generations, which seems to be expressed in those Terms, <HI>Laying God's Heritage waste;</HI> and indeed, that great Desolation in respect to the Posterity of Friends, hath been the natural Tendency of this inordinate Pursuit of Riches and Grandeur in Parents, as hath been amply verify'd by the Observations of succeeding Times.—<HI>Not all the Persecutions,</HI> said a certain eminent Elder, <HI>not all the Apostates, nor all the open or private Enemies we have ever had, have done us, as a</HI> Christian <HI>Society, the Damage that</HI> Riches <HI>have done.</HI>—In Fact, we see scarce any Thing more frequent than this, that when the laborious and frugal Father has amass'd a great Estate, and left it to his Children, they grow too high to stoop to those Singularities, and Instances of Self-denial, wherein they have been educated; the <HI>Quakers</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="010337_0048_0F7E80AE19A9A420"/>
Religion becomes a Burden, and perhaps thrown off for that which is most in Fashion.—The Im∣portance of this Affair was such, that in the Year 1698, a Province Meeting was held, consisting both of Men and ancient concerned Women, in order to wait on the Lord for Counsel, concern∣ing the proper Bounds of getting and right using the lawful Things of this World; and they testify'd that the Glory of the Lord covered their Assembly, and their Hearts were melted in his Presence; and under this Influence, the Persons that constituted that Meeting did by unanimous Consent, one by one, offer themselves to be subject to the Province Meeting, or any Elders appointed by that Meeting, with Regard to their outward Callings, Holdings, Trading or Dealing among Men, <HI>If any Thing should be judged to exceed the Bounds of Moderation."</HI></P>
<P>This Evil of Covetousness is so dangerous, that our Lord redoubles his Caution against it; <HI>Take heed, and beware of Covetousness;</HI> an Evil, though frequently disguised under the Cloaks of Tem∣perance, Industry and Frugality, yet engrosses the Affections as much as the Lust of the Flesh, or other more infamous Sins, and as effectually ex∣cludes from the Kingdom of God.—And as this Sin of Covetousness is so frequently, justly, and ar∣dently condemned and testified against, as it is the <HI>Root of all Evil;</HI> and among many unlawful Means it puts People on to gain this End, is that of buying and selling uncustom'd Goods.—And among many Advices from Yearly-meetings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> let us hear and take this of 1719. <HI>"Dear Friends,</HI> as our Testi∣mony hath ever been and still is against defrauding the King of any of his Customs, Duties or Excise, buying Goods reasonably suspected to be run, ex∣porting Wool or other Goods prohibited by Law, or doing any other Thing whatsoever to the Injury of the King's Revenues, or of the common Good,
<PB N="49" REF="010337_0049_0F7E80AED227CBF0"/>
or to the Hurt of the fair Trader; if any of our Profession shall be known to be guilty of these or other such Crimes, we do earnestly advise the respective Monthly-meetings, to which such Of∣fenders belong, severely to reprehend and testify against them, and their unwarrantable, clandestine and unlawful Actions, and admonish them to make Restitution for the Wrong done the Govern∣ment and the holy Truth professed by us."</P>
<P>Another Evil which springs from this bitter Root of Covetousness, is trading upon other Men's Foun∣dations.—For a full Detection of this enormous Sin, <HI>see</HI> Ambrose Rigge<HI>'s brief and serious Warning to such as are concerned in Commerce and Trading,</HI> in his Works, pag. 233.</P>
<P>The same Author says, pag. 348, "Be not lifted up if the World's Riches increase, for 'tis not always a Sign of the Favour of God; and be not cast down when they are taken away, for 'tis not a Sign of his Displeasure."</P>
<P><HI>Dr.</HI> Rutty<HI>'s Hist. of Friends in</HI> Ireland, pag. 57. The Love of God and the Brethren, (though sup∣planted by the Love of this World, in a human, carnal and apostatized Ministry, who have made a Trade of the Gospel, and followed Jesus for the Loaves) is all the Support the true Ministry wants: And as Love begets Love, whatever outward Sup∣port may be needful will be freely administered, according to the primitive Pattern.—And though such a Ministry may not enjoy great Riches and Revenues, yet as these are Provocatives to Lux∣ury, and many other Evils, this will be no Loss to them as spiritual Men; but on the contrary, less Temptation administred in respect to the Cares and Pleasures of this Life; and they will be en∣abled to apply themselves to the Concerns of the other with less Distraction, and shine as living Ex∣amples of Piety among the People."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="010337_0050_0F7E80AF90B4B008"/>
To corroborate this Observation, let us take that Of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s to <HI>Timothy,—Having Food and Raiment, let us therewith be content. But they that will be rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare, and into many foolish and hurtful Lusts, which drown Men in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erdition and Destruction. For the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themselves through with many Sorrows. But thou, O Man of God, flee these Things, and follow after Righteousness, God∣liness, Faith, Love, Patience and Meekness.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Root of all Evil (the Love of Money) too much prevail'd among us as a Society, I find concern'd Friends in <HI>Ireland</HI> advising against Trades∣men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being concerned in Trading in the Time of the Half-year's Meeting, alledging, <HI>That it was a Cumber to the Minds of Friends, when they should be concerned about the Lord's Business, and gives Occa∣sion to judge Friends are covetous-minded.</HI> And may it not be observed with Sorrow now, as formerly, when too many are embarrassing themselves in Trade, and breaking in upon the Solemnity of these Times, which as I conceive were originally appointed for the Service of Truth only: And tho' I decry su∣perstitious Forms, appointed Times, and Observation of Days, after the Inventions of the carnal Mind, (in which I long had my Conversation, but now deny) yet, as a certain ancient Worthy observes, <HI>There are some Forms among us, as Time and Place to meet together,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>necessary to the very Being, and Well-being of a religious Society.</HI> The Apostles were in a Form, when they assembled at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where with one Accord they were assembled in one Place, waiting for the Promise of the Holy Ghost, which we find descended in a wonderful Manner upon them; and by the powerful Preaching of the Apo∣stles, the People were so baptized, that the same Day there was added to the Church three Thousand
<PB N="51" REF="010337_0051_0F7E80B1643CCB60"/>
Souls; and we may see, that the holy Spirit not only descended on them, but remained on them; for they continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and in Fellowship; and they were daily with one Accord in the Temple, and breaking of Bread from House to House, not with double Views, but in Singleness of Heart, minding one Business only; not trading from House to House, but praising God in their Visits for this Addition to the Church, not to their Estates: And by this pious Example they were brought into Favour with Men also, and pro∣bably was a Means that so many were adding daily to the Church of such as should be saved; and not without Reason we may believe, divers of these were sent by the Almighty, with his Offers of Salva∣tion, to others which should believe through their Word.</P>
<P>Rutty<HI>'s History of Friends in</HI> Ireland, pag. 477. "I can't banish from my Mind, that a Degree of that general Lukewarmness and Indolence which have overspread the Churches, may have also af∣fected some of the <HI>Ministry;</HI> for if Truth be as amiable now as ever, as undoubtedly it is, but these less zealous in propagating it, it may be fear'd that some other Beloved hath interposed and seized some of them, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>World, and the Cares thereof;</HI> and if with regard to every private <HI>Christian</HI> they are as Thorns that choak the good Seed, it must prove still more eminently so in publick Stations, who are concern'd to minister spiritual Things to others; who in an especial Manner ought <HI>to shun the Entanglements of the Affairs of this Life.</HI> Had there been no Danger of this Sort incident to the <HI>Ministry,</HI> that Query would have been unnecessary, <HI>viz.

Advices of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> had been needless, <HI>viz.

I heard a solemn and awful Truth utter'd in a Meeting of Ministers and Elders by an eminent Minister; <HI>Corruption never did overspread the Church, unless Ministers and Elders gave way.</HI> And no doubt it nearly concerns all in these Stations, to exercise a holy Jealousy over themselves, lest they should not be found standing in the Gap in these perilous Times, when Desolation seems to threaten us."</P>
<P><HI>Extract from the Lives of the primitive</HI> Christians <HI>from</HI> William Caton's <HI>Abridgement.</HI> "The Members of this <HI>Christian</HI> common Wealth looked mean and contemptible: Nothing about them was pompous, either in Clothes, Diet, or Habitation, or Houshold Stuff.—Such as were noble or learn'd, or of a genteel Extract, laid aside all their Pride, and all their swelling Titles, and forgot that they had been better born or educated than others; and became like their Brethren.—Plait∣ing, or curling of Hair, was a Thing both their Men and Women proscribed from their Care; they thought that Labour lost, which was em∣ployed about such Superfluities: They were jea∣lous of their serious Frame of Mind and Spirit, and therefore all such Dresses as served to infuse Vanity into their Minds, or damp their Zeal to Religion, they shunn'd, as they did Houses infected
<PB N="53" REF="010337_0053_0F7E80B2AC369A80"/>
by the Plague.—They minded no such Thing as Modes and Fashions, nor did any new Habit or Ornament, that came up, intice them to Imita∣tion.—Decency was their Rule, and Modesty the Standard of their Habit and Conversation.—They wore nothing about them that was costly or curi∣ous.—Their Study and Contrivance was, how to make them sit for the Marriage of the Lamb.—Their Garments was either Linen, Woolen, Furr or Sheepskins, and their Furniture mean and homely.—They were despised for their Meanness. and were looked upon as unsociable, People of pitiful Spirits, Strangers to the Art of Conversation, melancholy Wretches, Brethren of Worms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they matter'd not the World's Censures, and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umphed more in a good Conscience, than the others could do in all the Vanities and Glories of this present World.—The World's Contempt was their Glory; they did not mind being under∣valued by the vulgar Crowd, that they might with greater Earnestness long after a better Inhe∣ritance.—If any wanted Business, and had no Need to work for their Living, they worked for the Poor. Idleness they had an Aversion to. The great Men and Women would do something, that the Needy might be the better for. She that had been the greatest Lady, did not disdain to spin, sew and knit for her distressed Neighbours.—Like Bees, they were ever employed for the common Good.—The Love of the World was Death to these <HI>Christians;</HI> they thought it a certain Sign that they had no Portion in Christ, if they at∣tempted to serve God and Mammon.—<HI>To be in the World, and not of the World,</HI> was their <HI>Motto.</HI>—They seem'd to be prophane, because they did not worship the <HI>Heathen</HI> Gods; but were more devout to the true God.—Not a few left their great Dignities, high Places, and swelling Titles,
<PB N="54" REF="010337_0054_0F7E80B3517ADE68"/>
to become <HI>Christians,</HI> and chose to be low and contemptible in the World, that they might have no Impediment in their Way to Heaven.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Christians</HI> mainly insisted upon this, That the Arts of curious and costly Dresses were injurious to God, and a Disparagement to his Workmanship.—Says <HI>Tertullian,</HI> we are not to seek after Neatness and Finery beyond what is simple and sufficient, and what pleases God; against whom they offend, who are not satisfy'd with his Workmanship.—<HI>Chrysostom</HI> commends <HI>Olympias,</HI> a Woman of great Birth and Estate, for the incredible Modesty and Meanness of her Attire.—The <HI>Christians</HI> were so far from the Af∣fectation of Bravery in rich and costly Things, that they thought they never could seem mean enough.—<HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> says, The Gar∣ments we should wear ought to be mean and fru∣gal, and that is the best which is farthest from Art and Curiosity.—The Ancients censured Intem∣perance, but, says <HI>Clemens,</HI> not to be compared with a nice, curious Study of Finess.—They cry'd out not only against the Costliness of their Clothes, but the Arts to add greater Handsomness than God had bestow'd upon them.—But some of these Times pleaded Riches; to which <HI>Cyprian</HI> answers, They are truly rich who are rich towards God, and the World ought to be despised with its Pomps and Delights, which we renounced when we hap∣pily turn'd to God; and Riches are to be govern'd by just Measures. For the Apostle commands all Women, how rich soever, <HI>to adorn themselves in modest Apparel, not with costly Array;</HI> and shews a more excellent way to bestow their Estates, <HI>to relieve the Hungry and feed the Poor.</HI>—This was the best Art of improving Riches."</P>
<P>Rutty's <HI>Hishory of Friends in</HI> Ireland. "The fore∣going Page informs us, not only how the primitive
<PB N="55" REF="010337_0055_0F7E80B8A4C9B598"/>
<HI>Christians</HI> cloathed themselves, but how they fur∣nished their Houses, agreeable to the Simplicity and Moderation of our elder Brethren, with Regard to the Furniture of their Houses; concerning which I am sorry to have Occasion to observe, that not a few of the present Generation have deviated a much greater Length from the pri∣mitive Precept and Example, than they have in Respect to the Ornaments of their Persons, whose Conduct in Relation to these two Particulars is so little uniform, that it would seem to imply, than provided they would retrench a little of the modish Superfluities in cloathing their Bodies, they had received an Indulgence to run into an unbounded Profusion and Extravagance in the Furniture of their Houses." And with the same Parity of Rea∣son may it be here added, that provided they deny'd themselves of gay and gaudy Cloathing, they might indulge an extravagant Disposition in that that is plain and grave, as if the Pride lay in the Colour only, and not in the Quality of the Garment; ne∣glecting the Apostle's Prohibition of costly Array, as well as Gold and superfluous Ornaments: And also forgetting the many Changes of Raiment, or changeable Suits of Apparel, the sine Linen, the Glasses, and curious Things which we find in the Catalogue of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Womens Pride and Dainti∣ness. This minding of high Things, pursuing great Riches, and purchasing costly Things, don't seem at all consistent with the Lip Acknowledgment of many, and the great Expressions of Humility, de∣basing ourselves below the most abject of all Beings, as weak, short-sighted, imperfect, unworthy Crea∣tures; Worms and not Men; Vanity, and less than nothing. And to see the Costliness of Apparel, and Furniture in Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the impious Nicety and Curiosity, as <HI>William Penn</HI> justly stiles it, among some of the plainer Sort in the Society, is
<PB N="56" REF="010337_0056_0F7E80BA41C60A60"/>
most astonishing, and would almost induce one to think, that provided they consider'd themselves in this humble Situation in the Sight of God, the supream Being, they might be indulged in their imagined Superiority and Distinctions which their Riches have made between them and their fellow Creatures.</P>

Now <HI>the Light of the just Man's Path, which shines more and more to the perfect Day,</HI> made fur∣ther Discoveries unto him; for whereas aforetime he had gratified the vain Minds of Men and Women in the Fashions and Superfluities then in vogue, now he
<PB N="73" REF="010337_0073_0F7E80CCD339AD38"/>
found a Restriction laid upon him, and a conscientious Scruple in doing such like Things: Howbeit, for some Time, through Reasoning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> permitted his Servant or Servants that wrought with him to have some hand in the doing of it. He did not at the first renounce all those Superfluities, and the Profits that might seem to arise therefrom, but the Light shone brighter and brighter, and discovered Things further and further; and as he sat in a Meeting on a certain Day (<HI>the Power of the Lord seized him</HI>) he was so remarkably affected, that his Hands were drawn together, the Use of his Limbs taken from him, and he fell down on the Floor, where he laid for some Time, to the Admiration of the Spectators. After this <HI>Visitation,</HI> which he took to be a Dispen∣sation of the righteous Judgments of the Lord, for his being instrumental in setting on of Lace on Womens Apparel, and other Superfluities of the Times, which frequently occur'd in his Business, he was sweetly favoured with an immediate Succession pf refreshing Consolation, so that he could sing of Judgment and Mercy. From that Time he never <HI>durst</HI> set on any Lace, or other superfluous Orna∣ments, or gratify the proud Minds of Men and Women in the vain Fashions and changeable Modes of the Times, neither with his own Hands, nor the Hands of his Servants, what Disadvantage soever it might be unto him: But the Lord prospered what he put his Hand to; he was with his Servant, and is with all the Faithful that follow his Leadings and Drawings of the Light and Truth, even to the giving an hundred Fold in this World, and in the World to come Life everlasting.</P>
<P>Soon after this, he was sent for by a great Man to make some very fine Clothes; when he saw the Work was to be wrought with many Superfluities, which for Conscience-sake he durst not undertake, upon his Refusal they told him, he might let his
<PB N="74" REF="010337_0074_0F7E80CDB5D00810"/>
Man do them; but he said he durst neither permit his Man to do them, nor assist him; then they said they must employ another. He was willing to lose all rather than his Peace with the Lord: He freely turn'd his Back of all that worldly Interest: And Providence so favoured his conscientious Care, that he got plan Work enough, and his Wages increased; as he was faithful in a little, the Lord made greater Things manifest unto him, for in the Families in which he had been light, airy and wanton, he was now made to reprove Vanity, and bear a living Testimony to the everlasting God in Word, Doc∣trine, Life and Conversation; and it pleased the Lord to dispense to him a Gift or Talent in the free living Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ, which through his Blessing he improved to God's Honour and the Comfort of Souls. He recruited in the World and lived reputably among his Neighbours; but the Officers were very rigorous in the Execution of the Law upon him, and in the Year 1683 was several Times in Prison, but the Lord made way for him and all that faithfully follow him, let their Difficulties be what they may. He was zealous in Discipline to keep up that Hedge, and strict and conscientious in the Nurture and Education of his Children.</P>

the Lord hath manifested to me his Displeasure against my being concerned in making any <HI>figur'd and gaudy Stuffs,</HI> whose End and Service was chiefly to satisfy the vain and proud Minds of Men and Women, that live in Disobedience to God; and that those Things have their Rise and Beginning, and are invented by Man, whose Heart and Mind is gone astray from the Counsel of the Lord, and therefore by such as come to yield up unto him, and take Counsel of his holy Spirit, they are to be deny'd and turn'd from; and we are not to reason with Flesh and Blood about these Things, saying, <HI>If I leave this Way, I know not how I shall get such a Maintenance for my Family as I now can; and if the Lord would make, out a Way for me in other Things, I could willingly part with this.</HI> And so are prefering their present Prosperity in this short and transitory Life, before their Peace and eternal Comfort and Felicity with the Lord for ever: O, <HI>my Friends,</HI> it is better to have inward Peace with the Lord, and the Seal and Testimony of Faithfulness born Witness unto us, and in us, though we do suffer in the outward, than to enjoy outward Comfort for a little Season, and want inward Peace.—<HI>My Friends,</HI> it is the Lord hath given unto me, that those that are obedient unto him, and bear a faithful Testimony for his Truth, against that Spirit of Pride and Wickedness, that so much abounds in this our Age, they shall not want that which is necessary for their Support in the outward; and on the contrary, they that refuse to obey the Lord and answer his Requirings, and think by continuing in that which grieves his holy Spirit, to gather to∣gether and increase in Riches, the Lord is able to blast all their Increase when he pleases; therefore let all be persuaded to be faithful to the Lord, and turn their Hearts and Minds to seek him

<HEAD><HI>A Paper to Friends and others, against the Pomps of the World used by many Tradesmen in their Vocations, contrary to many of their Sureties, Promises and Vows; by</HI> George Fox. <HI>Doctrinals.</HI> pag. 834.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>STAND in the eternal Power of God, Witnesses for the eternal God against the Devil and his Works, and the World, and the Lusts and Pomps and Vanities thereof; which World the Devil
<PB N="77" REF="010337_0077_0F7E80CFE9632378"/>
is God of. Now there is a Saying by the God∣fathers, so called, that they do promise and vow, <HI>&amp;c. to forsake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of the wicked World, and all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh,</HI> and vow for Children <HI>that they will not follow nor be led by them, but forsake them all.</HI> And do we not see many run into them all, or many of the Lusts and Pomps and Vanities of the World? And are not such offended at such Trades∣men that cannot trim their Clothes and Apparel according to the Pomps, Lusts and Fashions of the World, which pass away? But such Trades∣men as stand Witnesses in the Power and Truth of God, and connot fulfil Peoples Minds in the Lusts and Vanities of the World, I say, they are offend∣ed at them.</P>
<P>"But did God make Man and Woman with these Pomps and Vanities, and Lusts, or how came they into them? No, God did not make them with these Lusts and Vanities; but when Man and Woman forsook the living God, and disobey'd him, and followed the Serpent Satan, the Devil, then he filled them with the Pomps, Lusts and Vanities of a Wicked World, which he is God of: So they fell from the Righteousness, Holiness and Image of God, and transgressing the Command of God, and following the Serpent, he hath filled them with Pride, Malice and Hatred, and with the Lusts and Vanities of the World.—And some are grieved and vexed if they cannot have such Vanities as others have, and think much at such who are in Pomp and Pride above them, and the Lust the Devil begets in them, in Man and Woman in the Fall.—So it had a Beginning in Man and Woman, and must there have an End, if ever they come to God.—So they that stand faithful Wit∣nesses for God against the Pride, Pomps and Vani∣ties of the World, they cannot please nor satisfy
<PB N="78" REF="010337_0078_0F7E80D094EBE560"/>
them, <HI>though it bring them much Gain.</HI> For the Apostle faith, <HI>the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and Pride of Life, is not of the Father;</HI> [mark, <HI>not of the Father]</HI> not of God the Father, the Creator of all, that takes Care of all, who is Lord of all.—If these Lusts be not of the Father, who are they of then, but of the Devil, the God of this World? So these Tradesmen that are God's Witnesses, cannot fulfil these Lusts of the Eye, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are of the Devil, whom Christ destroys and his Works; and are sealed and certain Wit∣nesses in God's eternal Power, <HI>against all which is not of the Father,</HI> but of the Devil. And they are also Witnesses for <HI>that which is of God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ,</HI> and for his Glory, and for his Honour and Praise.</P>
<P>"But they that are in the Pomps and Vanities of a wicked World, and Followers of the God of this World, and his Works, <HI>the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and Pride of Life,</HI> they hate and persecute them that stand Witnesses against such Things, and will hardly employ such who stand Witnesses against their Pride. So these Trades∣men can hardly get any Trading while they wit∣ness for God, the Father's Power and Truth, against those who are in the Pomps and Vanities which is not of the Father. But in so doing they know they keep clean Consciences to God, and know and are assured that his Blessing rest upon them, who will bless them with Blessings from above and beneath, as they are Witnesses for God, who hath his upper and nether Springs to refresh them, which enables them to stand faithful Witnesses for the living God their Father, to whom be Glory for ever, whose Glory is over all the Works of his Hands, who is worthy to be served, worship∣ped and honoured for evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

"And therefore 'tis good for all to wait patiently upon the Lord, for some of you do know, that when Truth first broke out in <HI>London,</HI> many Tradesmen could not take so much Money in their Shops as would buy them Bread, because they withstood the World's Ways, Words, Fashions and Customs; yet by their patient waiting on the Lord, in their good Life and Conversation, they came to answer the Truth in Peoples Consciences; so there arose a Belief in People, <HI>that</HI> Friends <HI>would not wrong them in any Thing;</HI> so at last the Lord did increase his Blessings both inwardly and outwardly upon his People: Therefore let none murmur nor complain, but wait in <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> upon the Lord, who is both. God of Heaven and Earth; all is the Lord's, who can fill you both with his spiritual and temporal Blessings; therefore all walk worthy of them in Truth and Righteousness, and that whatever ye do in Word or Deed, it may be done to the Praise and Glory of God.</P>
