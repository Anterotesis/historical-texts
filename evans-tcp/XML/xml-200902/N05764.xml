<L>YE sacred Nine, whose sweetly flowing strains,</L>
<L>So long have charm'd <HI>Britannia</HI>'s blissful plains▪</L>
<L>So long have given her tuneful sons to claim,</L>
<L>The foremast rank amidst the rolls of same;</L>
<L>That <HI>Grece</HI> herself, your whilome favorite shore.</L>
<L>Deserted, boasts your residence no more;</L>
<L>But yields the glory to that pleasing grove.</L>
<L>Where <HI>Waller</HI> warbl'd forth his slighted love:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Denham, Dryden, Pope,</HI> or <HI>Prior</HI> sung.</L>
<L>Or matchless <HI>Shakespear</HI> charm'd the list'ning throng:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Chaucer</HI> crst reform'd th' unpolish'd swains,</L>
<L>Or greater <HI>Milton</HI> breath'd diviner strains:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Avon</HI> flows, or gently winding Tweed.</L>
<L>Or <HI>Thames</HI> reflects the primrose painted mead.</L>
<L>And since no more by fam'd <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> spring,</L>
<L>But <HI>Cowper</HI>'s hill, or <HI>Windsor</HI> shades ye sing;</L>
<L>O let me thence your heav'nly aid implore,</L>
<L>To themes unsung by British Muse before</L>
<L>The sparkling charms of th' <HI>Antigonian</HI> fair</L>
<L>For Beauty still shou'd be the Muses care:</L>
<L>For this, forsake your lov'd retreats awhile,</L>
<L>And deign to visit our remoter Isle.</L>
<L>What tho' the soul-enliv'ning source of Day,</L>
<L>Illumes our plains with more intemp'rate ray;</L>
<L>Yet cooling breezes fan the sultry noon,</L>
<L>And yield delights beneath a torrid sun.</L>
<L>What tho' no streams meander thro' the plains,</L>
<L>To slake the sev'rish thirst of languid swains;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="007317_0003_102B574E52F99310"/>
Yet spring and summer join to charm us here,</L>
<L>And endless verdure crowns the blooming year.</L>
<L>Come then <HI>Aonian</HI> Maids, come tuneful choir,</L>
<L>And beam upon our Isle poetic fire.</L>
<L>Come <HI>Paphian</HI> goddess, queen of love's domain,</L>
<L>With all the subjects of thy gentle reign;</L>
<L>The comely Graces from th' <HI>Idalian</HI> grove,</L>
<L>And little blind, but potent god of love;</L>
<L><HI>Eros</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> join'd,</L>
<L>Nor leave the goddess of bright youth behind;</L>
<L>While wakeful fancy wantons in your train,</L>
<L>T' exalt my numbers, and improve my strain,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BEGIN the Song from that most pleasing night,</L>
<L>When late th' assembl'd charmers shone so bright.</L>
<L>The dazling ring, whose rosy smiles could move,</L>
<L>The frozen hermits icy breast to love;</L>
<L>And like the sun that gilds the <HI>Greenland</HI> sea,</L>
<L>Make horrors shine and ev'ry gloom look gay.</L>
<L>Hail beauty, hail! tho' earthly, yet Divine,</L>
<L>For what knee bows not to thy sacred shrine?</L>
<L>While meaner Monarchs, meaner rule maintain,</L>
<L>A vassal-world acknowledges thy reign.</L>
<L>The prince that shines beneath th' Imperial crown,</L>
<L>For thee wou'd lay the sacred sceptre down;</L>
<L>While suppliant crowds to him bow down the knee,</L>
<L>More suppliant far he bends his soul to thee.</L>
<L>The heroe tried in many a well-fought day,</L>
<L>With pride confesses thy superior sway,</L>
<L>And crowns and kingdoms, trophies to his arms.</L>
<L>Lays with his heart, a trophy to thy charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE humble peasant at thy pleasing smile,</L>
<L>Forgets the mis'rses of perpetual toil,</L>
<L>And pleas'd can burn beneath the scorching sun,</L>
<L>To taste thy favours when his work is done.</L>

<L>WHEN virtue dwells with thy angelic form,</L>
<L>To her smooth paths thou canst the sinner charm:</L>
<L>But when, alas! thou treadst the sinners road,</L>
<L>Thou canst delude the saint himself from God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE sullen <HI>Cynic</HI> who avoids thy arms,</L>
<L>Blasphemes because he merits not thy charms,</L>
<L>And flies with dire remorse thy soft abode,</L>
<L>As <HI>Atheists</HI> shun the arguments for God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE savage <HI>Indian,</HI> whose death-dealing bow</L>
<L>Is all his art, and all he seeks to know,</L>
<L>Amidst the clouds of ignorance can see</L>
<L>A Pow'r Divine, and likens it to thee.</L>

<LG>
<L>SUCH beauty is, and so divinely bright,</L>
<L>Did she display her heav'nly chaims that night.</L>
<L>In each accomplish'd, sweetly smiling fair,</L>

<L>So fair her form, and so sublime her parts,</L>
<L>That words would only injure her deserts:</L>
<L>For where so many heav'nly beauties shine,</L>
<L>Angels shou'd sing, and language be divine!</L>

<HEAD>Some Thoughts from <HI>Seneca;</HI> Against <HI>Rash Judgment</HI> and <HI>Anger,</HI>
Not to be inquisitive, and hearken to<HI> Tale-Bearers, </HI>who mind every Body's Business, to the neglect of their own, and endeavour to part the dearest Friends in the World.</HEAD>
<P>IT is good for every Man to fortify himself on his weak side: and if he loves his Peace, he must not be Inquisitive, and hearken to <HI>Tale-bearers;</HI> for the Man that is over-curi∣ous to hear, and see every thing, multiplies Trou∣bles to himself: For a Man does not feel, what he does not know. He that is listening after <HI>private Discourse,</HI> and what People <HI>say of him,</HI> shall never be at Peace. How many things that are Innocent in themselves, are made Injurious yet, by miscon∣struction? Wherefore some things we are to pause upon, others to laugh at, and others again to par∣don. Or if we cannot avoid the Sense of Indignities, let us however shun the open profession of it; which may be easily done as appears by many Ex∣amples of those, that have suppress'd their Anger, under the Awe of a greater Fear. It is a good Caution <HI>not to believe any thing till we are very cer∣tain of it,</HI> for many probable things prove false, and a short time will make Evidence of the un∣doubted Truth. We are prone to believe many Things which we are unwilling to hear, and so we
<PB N="2" REF="007317_0010_102B5761C2E38468"/>conclude, and take up a prejudice before we our judge. <HI>Never <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Friend unheard;</HI> or with∣out letting him know his Accuser or his Crime. 'Tis a common thing to say, <HI>Do not you tell that you had it from me, for if you do, I'le deny it, and never tell you any thing again.</HI> By which means, Friends are set together by the Ears, and the <HI>Infor∣mer</HI> slips his Neck out of the Collar. Admit no Stories upon these terms; for it is an unjust thing to <HI>Believe</HI> in private, and to be <HI>Angry</HI> openly. He that delivers himself up to Guess, and Conjecture, runs a great hazard; for there can be no Suspicion without some probable Grounds; so that without much Candor, and Simplicity, and making the best of every thing, there is no living in Society with Mankind. Some things that offend us we have by report; others we see, or hear. In the first Case, let us not be too Credulous; some People <HI>frame Stories that they may deceive us:</HI> Others, only tell what they hear, and are deceiv'd Themselves. Some make it their Sport to do ill Offices; others do them only to pick a Thank: There are some that would <HI>part the dearest Friends in the World;</HI> Others love to do Mischief, and stand aloof off, to see what comes on't. If it be a small matter, I would have witnesses, but if it be a greater, I would have it <HI>upon Oath,</HI> and allow time to the Accused, and Counsel too, and hear it over and over again.</P>
<P>IN those Cases where we ourselves are Witnesses, we should take into Consideration all the Circum∣stances. If a <HI>Child,</HI> 'twas <HI>Ignorance: If a Woman,</HI> a <HI>Mistake:</HI> If done by <HI>Command,</HI> a <HI>Necessity;</HI> If a <HI>Man</HI> be Injur'd, 'tis but <HI>Quid pro quo.</HI> If a <HI>Judge</HI> be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> what he does: If a <HI>Prince,</HI> I must <HI>Sub∣mit;</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="007317_0011_102B576349CCF4F8"/>either, if <HI>Guilty,</HI> to <HI>Justice,</HI> or if <HI>Innocent;</HI> to <HI>Fortune:</HI> If a <HI>Brute,</HI> I make myself one by <HI>Imitat∣ing</HI> it: if a <HI>Calamity,</HI> or <HI>Disease,</HI> my best Relief is <HI>Patience:</HI> If <HI>Providence,</HI> 'tis both <HI>Impious</HI> and <HI>Vain</HI> to be <HI>Angry</HI> at it: If a <HI>Good</HI> Man I'll make the <HI>Best</HI> on't; If a <HI>Bad,</HI> I'll never <HI>Wonder</HI> at it. Nor is it only by <HI>Tales,</HI> and <HI>Stories,</HI> that we are inflam'd, but <HI>Suspicions, Countenances;</HI> nay, a <HI>Look,</HI> or a <HI>Smile</HI> is enough to blow us up. In these Cases let us suspend our Displeasure, and plead the Cause of the Absent. <HI>Perhaps he is innocent;</HI> or <HI>if not, I have time to consider on't, and may take my Revenge at Leisure:</HI> but when it is once <HI>Executed,</HI> 'tis not to be <HI>Recall'd.</HI> A <HI>Jealous Head</HI> is apt to take that to himself which was never meant him. Let us therefore trust to nothing, but what we see: And chide our selves where we are over Credulous. By this Course we shall not be so easily impos'd upon; nor put to trouble ourselves about things not worth the while; as the Loytring of a Servant upon an Erand, the Tumbling of a Bed; or the Spilling of a Glass of Drink. 'Tis a Madness to be disorder'd at these Fooleries. We consider the thing done, and not the Doer of it. <HI>It may be he did it Unwil∣lingly; or by Chance. It was a trick put upon him, or he was forc'd to't. He did it for Reward per∣haps, not Hatred; nor of his own Accord; but he was egg'd on to't.</HI> Nay some regard must be had to the Age of the Person, or to Fortune; and we must consult Humanity, and Candor in the Case. One does me a <HI>Great Mischief</HI> at <HI>Unawares.</HI> A∣nother does me a very <HI>small</HI> one by <HI>Design:</HI> Or peradventure none at all, but intended me one. The Latter was more in Fault, but I'll be Angry
<PB N="4" REF="007317_0012_102B5765C3F93258"/>with neither. We must distinguish betwixt what a Man <HI>cannot</HI> do, and what he <HI>will</HI> not. <HI>'Tis true; he has once offended me, but, How often has he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me? He has offended me often, and in other kinds. And why should not I hear it as well now as I have done?</HI> Is he my <HI>Friend?</HI> why then <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against his will. Is he my Enemy? 'Tis no more then I look'd for.</HI> Let us give way to wise Men, and not squabble with Fools, and say thus to our selves, <HI>We have all of us our Errors;</HI> No Man is so Circum∣spect, so considerate, or so fearful of offending, but he has much to answer for. A Generous Prisoner cannot immediately comply with all the sordid, and Laborious Offices of a Slave. A Footman that is not breath'd, cannot keep pace with his Master's Horse: He that is over-watch'd, may be allow'd to be Drowzy. All these things are to be weigh'd before we give any Ear to the first Impulse. If it be my Duty to love my Country, I must be kind also to my Countrymen: If a Veneration be due to the Whole so is a Piety also to the Parts: And it is the Common Interest to preserve them. We are all Members of one Body, and it is as Natural to help one another, as for the hands to help the feet, or the eyes the hands. Without the Love, and Care of the Parts, the whole can never be pre∣serv'd, and we must spare one another, because we are born for Society, which cannot be maintain'd, without a Regard to Particulars. Let this be a Rule to us, never to deny a Pardon that does no Hurt either to the Giver, or Receiver. That may be well enough in <HI>One,</HI> which is Ill in <HI>Another;</HI> and therefore we are not to condemn any thing that is Common to a Nation: for Custom defends it. But
<PB N="5" REF="007317_0013_102B57685416C2E0"/>much more Pardonable are those things which are Common to Mankind.</P>
<P>IT is a kind of Spiteful Comfort, that whoever does me an Injury, may receive one, and that there is a Power over him that is above me. A Man should stand as firm against all Indignities, as a Rock does against the Waves. As it is some satis∣faction to a Man in a Mean Condition, that there is no Security in a more prosperous; And as the Loss of a Son in a Corner is born with more Patience, upon the sight of a Funeral carry'd out of a Palace; So are Injuries, and Contempts, the more tolerable from a meaner Person, when we consider, that the <HI>Greatest Men,</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> are not exempt. The wisest also of Mortals, have their failings, and no Man living is without the same Excuse. The dif∣ference is, that we do not all of us transgress the same way: but we are oblig'd in Humanity <HI>to bear one with another.</HI> We should, every one of us be∣think ourselves how remiss we have been in our Duties: How immodest in our Discourses; how Intemperate in our Cups; and why not as well how Extravagant we have been in our Passions. Let us clear our selves of this Evil, purge our minds, and utterly root out all those Vices, which, upon leaving the least string will grow again, and recover. We must Think of every thing, Expect every thing that we may not be Surpriz'd. It is a Shame, says <HI>Fabius,</HI> for a Commander to excuse himself, by say∣ing, <HI>I was not aware of it.</HI></P>

<PB N="6" REF="007317_0014_102B576A8091D7F0"/>an Injury simply <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of an Injury done which we have not deserv'd. Some are Naturally given to Anger; Others are provok'd to't by Occasion; The Anger of Women, and Children, is commonly sharp, but not lasting: Old Men are rather queru∣lous, and peevish. Hard Labour, Diseases, Anxiety of Thought, and whatsoever hurts the Body, or the Mind, disposes a Man to be Froward, but we must not add fire to fire.</P>
<P>HE that duly considers the subject Matter of all our Controversies, and Quarrels, will find them Low, and Mean, and not worth the Thought of a Gene∣rous Mind; but the greatest Noise of all is about <HI>Money.</HI> This is it, that sets Fathers and Children together by the Ears; Husbands and Wives; and makes way for Sword and Poison: This is that, tires out Courts of Justice; enrages Princes, and lays Cities in the Dust, to seek for Gold, and Silver in the Ruins of them. This is it, that finds work for the Judge, to determine, which side is least in the wrong; And whose is the more plausible Ava∣rice, the Plantiffs, or the Defendants: And what is it that we contend for all this while, but those Baubles that make us Cry, when we should Laugh? To see a Rich old Cuff, that has no Body to leave his Estate to, break his Heart for a handful of Dirt; And a Gouty Usurer, that has no other Use of his Fingers left him, but to Count withal; to see him I say, in the Extremity of his Fit, wrangling for the odd Money in his Interest:—If all that's precious in Nature were gather'd into one Mass, it were not worth the trouble of a Sober Mind. It were end∣less to run over all those ridiculous Passions that are mov'd about Meats, and Drinks, and the matter of
<PB N="7" REF="007317_0015_102B576D474878B0"/>our Luxury; Nay, about Words, Looks, Actions, Jealousies, Mistakes, which are all of them as Con∣temptible Fooleries as those very Baubles that Chil∣dren Scratch, and Cry for. There is nothing Great, or Serious in all that which we keep such a Clutter about; the Madness of it is, that we set too great a value upon Trifles. One Man flies out upon a Sa∣lute, a Letter, a Speech, a Question, a Gesture, a Wink, a Look. An Action moves one Man; A Word affects another: One Man is tender of his Family; another of his Person; One sets up for an Orator; Another for a Philosopher; This Man <HI>will</HI> not bear Pride, nor that Man Opposition. He that <HI>plays</HI> the Tyrant at Home, is as <HI>gentle</HI> as a Lamb Abroad. Some take Offence if a Man ask a Favour of them, and others, if he does not. Eve∣ry Man has his weak side; Let us <HI>learn</HI> which that is and take a care of it; for the same thing does not work upon <HI>all Men alike.</HI> We are moved <HI>like Beasts,</HI> at the <HI>Idle appearances</HI> of things; and the fiercer the Creature, the more is it <HI>startled.</HI> The sight of a <HI>Red Cloth</HI> enrages a <HI>Bull.</HI> A Shadow pro∣vokes the Asp; Nay, so <HI>unreasonable</HI> are some Men, that they take Moderate Benefits for Injuries; and <HI>Squabble</HI> about it, with their nearest <HI>Relations; They have done this and that for others,</HI> they cry; And <HI>they might have dealt better with us if they had plea∣sed.</HI> Very Good! And if it be less than we look'd for, it may be yet more than we deserve. Of <HI>all</HI> Unquiet humours, this is the worst, that <HI>will</HI> never suffer any Man to be happy, so long as he sees a happier Man than himself.</P>
<P>HOW Vain, and <HI>Idle</HI> are many of those things that make us stark Mad! A resty Horse, the over∣turning
<PB N="8" REF="007317_0016_102B576FC50DB380"/>of a Glass; the <HI>falling</HI> of a Key, the Drag∣ging of a Chair, a <HI>Jealousie,</HI> a <HI>Misconstruction.</HI> How <HI>shall</HI> that Man endure the <HI>Extremities</HI> of Hunger, and Thirst, that flies out into a rage <HI>only</HI> for the putting of a <HI>little</HI> too much Water in his Wine? What haste is there to <HI>lay</HI> a Servant by the <HI>Heels,</HI> or break a Leg or an Arm <HI>immediately</HI> for't, as if he were not to have the same power over him an hour after, that he has at that Instant.</P>
<P>When we are abroad we can bear <HI>well enough</HI> with <HI>foul</HI> ways, nasty Streets, noisom Ditches; but a spot upon a Dish at home, or an unswept Hearth, <HI>absolutely distracts us.</HI> And what's the Reason, but that we are Patient in the one <HI>Place,</HI> and <HI>phantasti∣cally</HI> Peevish in the other? Nothing makes us more Intemperate than Luxury, that shrinks at every stroke, and starts at every shadow. 'Tis Death to some to have another sit <HI>above</HI> them, as if a Body were <HI>ever</HI> the more, or <HI>the less honest for the Cushion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HOW ridiculous was that of</HI> Cyrus; <HI>who, in his design upon</HI> Babylon, <HI>found a River in his way that put a stop to his March: The current was strong, and carried away one of the Horses that be∣longed to his own Chariot: upon this he swore, that since it had obstructed his Passage, it should never hin∣der any Body's else: And presently set his whole Ar∣my to work upon't, which diverted it into a hundred and fourscore Channels, and laid it dry. In this Ig∣noble, and unprofitable employment, he lost his Time, and the Soldiers their Courage, and gave his Adver∣saries an opportunity of providing themselves, while he was waging War with a River, instead of an Enemy.</HI></P>
