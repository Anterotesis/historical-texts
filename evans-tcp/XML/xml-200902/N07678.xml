<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> Second Part of the <HI>Quakers ASSISTING,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have undertook ro Vindicate the Con∣duct of our worthy Citizens, I think there remains something more to advance, to Incomomise their Actions; and to shew to the World the darefull Consequences of the others Conduct. We must all allow, that we are Subor∣dinate to <HI>England;</HI> our Laws receive their Essence, i.e. Their very Life and Being from the <HI>English</HI> Laws; therefore I say, while we are thus situated, it is impossible to form Laws here Contrary to those Laws: And where our Legislative body to agree together, form an Edict, and publish it as such, it could have no more Weight or Force here, then a single Blank; because there is nothing to support it; yet we derive from the Essence of the <HI>English</HI> Laws, a Privelege to make such Acts, as may serve our Necessities or Occasions; but when they come upon Compotion with the Royal Laws, they must all nuckle into Subordination. I look upon this nearly a simelar Case with the <HI>Quakers</HI> and their Society Rules: Notwithstanding they are satyriz'd by a set of mean envious Lowliv'd Scriblers, I have Transcribed in the first Place a Law; that was made in Heaven, and given to <HI>Moses,</HI> by GOD him∣self; a Law that is binding (as I there observed) to all Nations of People; a Law that it is impossible
<PB N="3" REF="009807_0003_0F7A551FD1A935B0"/>
for Man to be exempt from; he must either submit in mercy, or in Judgment: I say, this Law is the most extensive and the most binding, for the good of Indiveduals, in civil Society, of any Law that ever was Publish'd on Earth; i.e. <HI>Whosoever shedeth Man's blood, by Man his blood shall be shed: If a Stranger or Sojourner live with thee, thou shalt love him as thy self.</HI> What can be more binding? Nay the Almighty has been so particularly carefull of his Creatures, that he has stampt the very Image of this Law in the Heart of every Man, and there it remains (until Men give themselves up to utter Distruction) that a Man cannot see his Neighbour in Danger of loosing that Life, which GOD hath de∣creed shall End in the Course of Nature, without making him all the help in his Power; no more than he can take it from him: But if an Omission of that sort should ever happen, what can be more convincing to the World, then that Person is, a party concern'd in the murder, or at least consents to that horrid Crime, which brings him in equally guilty: These are undeniable Facts, and now I come to consider, the several Denominations of People, respecting worship, as they have each of them Rules in their Society, suiting their Inclina∣tions to keep Matters in a good Decorum among their own Members, which is commendable: Yet when this universal Law calls for immediate sub∣mission; it's impossible the Society, Rules can in any sort interfear, the one is an act in civil Society, the other only rules in the Religious, the one is Instituted by Christians, the other has the Pre∣valance over both Christians and Heathens, throughout the World. The one is instituted by
<PB N="4" REF="009807_0004_0F7A5520B7CA9BA8"/>
the great Creator of the Universe, an Irrepealable Law to the End of Time, for the well-being of his Creator's; the other is instituted by (sometimes) well thinking Men, to keep their Members within the Bounds of good order: Then all those Rules, in each Religious Society, that are good, must be Consequents of this Royal Law, and have such a near Unity and Affinity with it, that they Contri∣bute mightily to the Propogation and Promulga∣tion of it, they are so incorporated with it, that its impossible to set them at Variance. How then can any Man be so wretchedly blind, as to sup∣pose, that any Society of people can form Rules to bar against divine Justice? well, that's what this <HI>Unmasker</HI> asserteth, when he saveth; the <HI>Quakers</HI> forsook their Principles in helping to save the Lives of their Neighbours: Then, I say, agreeable to the Import of his Arguments, or as he would fain have it, and if they had stood Neuter, according to his faint Opinion of their Principles, they would not only have bar'd against this Divine Law, but would have bid open Defiance to it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How∣ever I shall now undertake to shew the Reader, wherein this Writer has cleared the <HI>Quakers</HI> from all the heavy Charges, he himself has thrown upon them; i.e. He seemingly Evidenceth against them in a Chain of Satyrical invectives, without instan∣cing one single Fact: Nay, he proves no one Thing against them, wherein a standard by, can say, ill they have done; therefore I say, the whole Charge retorts upon himself, and he must un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it: there is none else to share with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Man seemingly Charges <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Justice, with a Breach
<PB N="5" REF="009807_0005_0F7A5521257A48B8"/>
of some one or more of the Laws, whereby he looks upon himself injured, the Court will require Facts produced, before they can give Judgment; and this Accuser not being able to produce any Thing, more than calumnious Accusations, with∣out <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ancing one single fact, whereby the De∣fendant hath broke any one Law, or even Trans∣gress'd the Rules of Morality, thes Defendant is im∣mediately discharged, and cleared of, and from, all the false seeming Accusations. (I ask what has clear'd him?) and answer, the Accusers own Evi∣dences, given before the Bench, which was upon a strict enquiry, no other but slanderous and un∣warantable Expressions, accompanied with bitter∣ness of Heart against his Neighbour; Not one single Fact proved; I look upon this to be a pa∣rallel Case with the <HI>Quakers</HI> and this Enemy to all good, who has been Stigmatizing that Society with being guilty of party Rage, publishing inflamatary Pamphlets, asserting many falshoods to swell the Current of prejudices, nearly a blasphemer of GOD, and a beliar of the Holy GHOST; but has proved not one of those Charges: Nay he has not pro∣duced one single position, that has weight enough in it self, to perswade me to forbare asserting, that they are all positive falshoods. Well, what fol∣lows? Why a shower of Rain, falling from the Clouds, must lite somewere. So must these Ac∣cusations, that have been uttered, by the Month of one of <HI>Baal</HI>'s priests: They cannot be lost, they must lite somewere; (I ask were?) He has intirely cleared the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and accused none else. I answer they must return to the Place from whence
<PB N="6" REF="009807_0006_0F7A5521F6952CD0"/>
they came; there is none other place for them; i.e. The Dog must lick up his own Vomit, and the Hog must still wallow in the Mire: And this is all I can find his long written Harrangue proveth, that he himself is, (and not the <HI>Quakers,</HI>) the promoter of party Rage, publisher of inflamatery pamphlets, asserting many falshoods, to swell the Current of prejudices, nearly a Blasfamer of GOD, and a be∣liar of the Holy GHOST. I think the D—l. acted in a very Rascally manner with this poor fellow; I quite pitty him; it was that Serpent set him to work, in the very beginning; dictated his whole writing, which indeed might seem some Ease or Help to him, for the present, because he had no more to do, then to write after him, and at that Time doubtless shewed a great deal of Love and Friendship to him; but behold! when his faithful Servants was like to be detected, and the Villan∣ous Scheme brought to Light, that old Serpent slipt (as the saying is) his Neck out of the Halter, and leaves the <HI>Unmasker</HI> a condemned Criminal to answer for the whole, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Well what remains, but to consider in speculation the Consequence of that Horrid Act? May not the Hand of Divine Justice afflict this Land of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> for the guilt∣less blood that was shed therein; I mean the blood of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that was spilt at <HI>Lancaster;</HI> as he did <HI>Israel</HI> with Famine or Pestilence, for the Transgression of <HI>Saul,</HI> in Slaying the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> who were in Al∣liance with them. We may read in the 21. Chap. of the second Book of <HI>Samuel, that there was a Famine over the Land of</HI> Judea, <HI>for three Years; and when</HI> David <HI>enquir'd of the Lord into the Cause</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="009807_0007_0F7A5522AB11D160"/>
<HI>of it,</HI> the Answer was, <HI>it is for</HI> Saul <HI>and his bloody House;</HI> because he slew the <HI>Gibeonites.</HI> The King then called the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> and queried of them what he should do for them? In doing of which he might appease the Wrath of divine Justice.) Their answer was <HI>the Man that consumed us and that devised against us; let seven Men of his Sons be deli∣vered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>in</HI> Gibeah <HI>of</HI> Saul: <HI>This being done, the Lord was pleased, to bless the Land again."</HI> Here we see that the Inanimate Earth must bear the Curse of GOD's Wrath, for a Time, untill the Blood of <HI>Saul</HI>'s nigh Relatives made the Aronement, for his Crime. Oh! my esteemed Citizens, if that should be the Case with us, how would you rejoice in secret, to feel the unspeakable Peace, that would arise in your Hearts, when Reflecting on that act of Justice, in obediance to the Royal Law; I mean the saving of the Lives of your Fellow-Creatures. I say, it must afford hearty Satisfaction, to know yourselves clear of the Blood of all Men, and that you, by your honest Endeavours, and the blessing of Heaven, hath protected and preserved the Lives of more than one hundred of your Neighbours. One other Instance I shall give; and that was on our own Continent, in <HI>Boston</HI> Government, where the <HI>Quakers</HI> were used in the most cruel Manner, that the Serpentine Nature in Man could invent, they bore cruel Whippings, cutting off their Ears, and several were murdered, and for no other rea∣son, then for their faithful obedience to CHRIST. And this was all acted by this <HI>Unmasker</HI>'s dear Brethren, <HI>viz.</HI> Envious, Malicious, Hard-hearted,
<PB N="8" REF="009807_0008_0F7A55236A5E3CB8"/>
<HI>Presbyterians.</HI> I don't remember ever reading, or bearing tell, that any one <HI>Quaker</HI> was ever put to Death, for his Religious Principles, but in <HI>Boston</HI> Government: beware, beware, my Country∣men, keepthe Reins of Government out of the Hands of <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> for I believe they never had it, but that one Time, since the building of <HI>Babel;</HI> and I pray, they never may have it more, until Time is swallowed up in Eternity. Well what follows? Why the Judgment of GOD upon their Land, as I have heard one of their Inhabitants say; that the Land about <HI>Boston</HI> was as agreeable too, and bore, as good Wheat, as any Part of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Colony: But since they had put the Quakers to Death, that same Ground has never brought fourth any Wheat to persection. This was in the Year 1659, and whether the Judgment will Terminate here, di∣vine Wisdom only knows. How convincing must these Citations be, to every solid thinking Man, that our worthy Citizens could have done no one Thing more pleasing to GOD, then their joining together, as one Man, in Vindicating his Righteous Law, with their Hands and Hearts, lifted up to implore a Blessing on their concentious Endeavours; for we see, by the above cited Instances, that there is no Attonement to be made for Willfull murder, but by sheding the blood of the Murderer; or the Earth must feel the weight of GOD's Wrath. Al∣thoug King <HI>Saul</HI> had been dead a Number of Years, yet infinite Wisdom, in his own Time, made the firtle Soil of Palastine become a dry and barren Land, for that one Man's cruel act; and that not parpi∣trated on a single <HI>Isrealite,</HI> but on Strangers or So∣journers,
<PB N="9" REF="009807_0009_0F7A5524317FFB58"/>
i. e. a Parallel Case with that at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> only with this odds, <HI>Saul,</HI> was King of <HI>Isreal,</HI> and had the Rule of Government in his Hands, and it is said, he did it in his Zeal; whereas those Rebels had no Power, but what they received from Lu∣cifer: nor no Zeal but to vindicate their Masters Cause: And as to the second Instance, History informs us, that the Judgments of GOD was evi∣dently manifested, on several of those wicked Men in being brought to stange and untimely Deaths▪ Their Governor, <HI>John Endicot,</HI> was visited with a loathsome Disease, in so much that he stunk alive, and so died with Rottenness: <HI>Richard Billingham,</HI> which succeeded <HI>Endicot,</HI> some Years after went Dis∣tracted, and so he died: General <HI>Aderton</HI> was Rid∣ing towards his own House, when his Horse took fright at a Cow, crossing the Way, and threw him down so violently, that he died, his Eyes being started out of his Head, his Brains out of his Nose, his Tongue out of his Mouth, and his blood out of his Ears, <HI>John Norton,</HI> the high Priest of that infer∣nal Clan had been at his Worship-House, in the Fore∣noon, and intended to go again in the Afternoon and as he was walking in his House, he fetched a great Groan, and leaned his Head against the Mantle-Tree of the Chimney, and was heard to say, the Hand or the Judgments of the LORD are upon me; these were his last Words, and died away Those were some of the Chief leaders of that cruel Tribe of inhuman Butchers, whose Catrastrophy I have given to my Readers; though but briefly. And I can find no more good Men among all the <HI>Boston Presbyterians,</HI> then the Angels found in <HI>So∣dom,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="009807_0010_0F7A55259907FD50"/>
when they were sent to Destroy it. They found but Righteous Lot; I can find but Righteous <HI>John Cotton</HI> whose Principles and Practice I am fond of publishing to the World: He was a <HI>Pres∣byterian,</HI> and I believe the best Preacher, as well as the best Man they had among them; he ever op∣posed Per<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tion, and gave his Reason for it in the following Words, <HI>viz.</HI> I remember how at our Departure from <HI>England,</HI> I preached on <HI>Acts</HI> the 4th v. 11. And shewed from that Text, that there was an inward Grace, which was to be minded, and that therefore, I will not give my Vote for Perse∣cuting the Asserters of that Doctrine? I don't see how the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> can be angry at me, for they may see how, impartially I deal, between them and the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and that it's really for want of Matter that I don't praise them more: Well, at last, those Persecutors had to give an Account at the Righteous Judgment Seat of Heaven, and there receive their Sentence, for that cursed Act, and the Land groans (if the word may be allowed) under the load of that Innocent Blood, to this Day; yet the same Principels, and Spirit, seems to Rule in that Society; at this Time, as did in their Brethren I have just been speaking of; (though I believe 'not' all; I believe there is good Men amongst them;) but oh! their Leaders, their Leaders, cause GOD's People to Err; (observe) the <HI>Prophet</HI> when speak∣ing of <HI>Israel,</HI> saveth the Leaders of my People cause them to Err; these I suppose to be the Priests, and their Adhearants, among the <HI>Pharisees;</HI> for they in common had the Rule in Church and State, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Prophet</HI> doth not say, those Leaders
<PB N="11" REF="009807_0011_0F7A552607533A98"/>
<HI>were GOD's People, o not that they were even his Crea∣tion; nay might we not suppose (did not Reason bar a∣gainst it) that those very Leaders, whom the Prophet speaks off, had tumbled out of another Region, into the World, and but interloped themselves amongst God's People, and their usurped Authority; and then En∣deavoured to work out all Sense of God, and godliness, that had taken Place in the Hearts of the People, by levening them into their own Principels, inculcating into their Minds Vice, Immorality, Hatred, Envy, evil-speaking bitterness of Heart, and a perpetual Hatred to the</HI> Seaduces <HI>and</HI> Essences, <HI>which were a better Peo∣ple then themselves: Here is the very Model of our</HI> Presbyterians; <HI>but I had lik'd to have call'd them</HI> Pha∣risees; <HI>and indeed I have but one Thing to object against it, and that is perhaps In<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght be puzzled to prove, to every Man's satisfaction, how those hateful Principles have been preserved, in such lively colour (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> display) for so many hundred Years; that as, from the Externation of the</HI> Pharisees, <HI>to the coming forth of the</HI> Presbyterians, <HI>However, I'll give you my opinion freely, which is, that they have been kept in a warm Clime, in the lower Regions, until</HI> Lecipher <HI>the</HI> Sechim <HI>of that World, and now Chief Ruler of their Society, by long and unwearied <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but at length found an openness of Heart in some of their Proginators, to receive those Principles as freely as the wide Ocean receiveth the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; nay there is no one Thing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, then that their Leaders, then Advocates, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> more then the Distruction of God's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> into their Minds.

to all other religious Societies, though far better then themselves; ot how can it be other∣wise? Don't we see every Week almost a fresh brand, spew'd out of the Mouth of old Crocus, on purpose to scourge the Quakers? But alaas! for them, they are whipping their own back∣sides; nay not contented without striping to the very Buff, and then lay on, Jehu like, by guess: I remember hearing People say, when I was a Boy, that guess work is best; when it hits right; then this must be right, and agreeable to Scripture Doctrine, where it is said, he that diggeth a Pit for another, shall fall into it himself.</P>
