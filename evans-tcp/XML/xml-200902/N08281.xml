<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>DR. JOHN LINING having prosecuted a course of <HI>statical experiments,</HI> for the space of one year at Charlestown, the authour of the following ESSAY, became, afterwards, so closely connected with him, both by mutual interest and friendship, as gave him an opportunity to be fully informed of all he desired to know, relating to the perspira∣tion and other natural discharges in each season. By those means, he hath been led to judge otherwise than <HI>Sanctorius</HI> did; and it is difficult to conceive on what grounds the <HI>latter</HI> founded his notions, with respect to the numerous ill consequences he imputes to an abatement of the perspiration alone; nor is it less surprising, that so many great men, should have so implicitly adopted his mistakes.</P>
<P>The authour hath supposed, that <HI>a spasmodical contraction of the arteries and other musculous mem∣branes, is the immediate cause of severish disorders,</HI> in whatever way this may be brought on; but
<PB N="iv" REF="010575_0005_0F80D15EE145E9F0"/>
should that term displease, another of the same meaning may be used in its stead; for all the symptoms in acute diseases show something of this sort, the severity or mildness of those distempers, for the most part keeping pace with the degree of that <HI>constriction,</HI> and the number of vessels it affects.</P>
<P>Having oftentimes been disappointed in his prac∣tice, though he followed the methods recommend∣ed by the best writers, so far as they were under∣stood by him, he undertook a journal of the weather and the diseases also that accompanied its changes, in the several seasons, and kept the same for many years in hopes of improvement. For however ne∣cessary it may be, to examine our patients with great exactness at all times, it is more particularly so during a pursuit of this sort, as well as to note every favourable and unfavourable circumstance. This soon discovered, that when certain symptoms occurred at the beginning of a fever, the complaint, generally, was mild and of short continuance; nor would the patient be seized with any inflammatory disease, though such did not fail to attack others, who sickened at the same time, but without the like propitious incidents. After carefully attending to this, in great numbers of cases, the hint was not slighted, for what happened of its own accord, and
<PB N="v" REF="010575_0006_0F80D15FA469DE70"/>
prevented such distempers, was brought on by art to remove them, after they were fixed.</P>
<P>Nothing was more wanted, than a safe, speedy, and, as far as the nature of things will permit, a certain method to remove fevers, within the first or second day: This surely would well deserve the name of a cure; but when they are allowed to run through the several stages, into which they would pass, were they left to their own courses, and the patients recover at last, all the merit that then can be pleaded is, that nothing improper had been done; and happy would it be, could this be said on all oc∣casions, for indeed there is much merit in it.</P>
<P>Were it granted, that inflammatory and other common fevers, may probably yield to the follow∣ing treatment, in warm but not in cold countries, the insinuation is more specious than true; for the human body is of the same construction every where, differing only in being more braced in one climate, and laxer in another. And, truly, the inhabitants of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> vary as much in those respects, during the winter and summer, as if they dwelt in climates the most opposite in temperature. Besides, the same distemper will be much alike in its symp∣toms
<PB N="vi" REF="010575_0007_0F80D160767EF550"/>
and events, and, therefore, must require the same management, or nearly so, in all places.</P>
<P>The authour hath practised in the way hereafter laid down, for many years, and with such success, that he is under no apprehensions of its failing often, provided his directions be but duly followed. And having dealt candidly in publishing it, in hopes it may be of some use to the people of this province, candour requires that it should not be judged of, by the fallacious rules either of prepossession or preju∣dice, but fair experiments only. He warns the reader however, that neither this nor any other me∣thod will at all times cure; for every one of the pro∣fession, must have found in the course of his prac∣tice, that somewhat of a hidden nature now and then occurs, even in the complaints he thought himself best acquainted with, which, in spite of his boasted sagacity, disappointed him. Whether this depended on certain singularities in the constitutions of individual persons, the nature of the distemper itself, or his own oversights, it might not be possible for him to discover; or even if he could, it might not then be in his power to remedy it.</P>
<P>It was deemed sufficient to point out the method, and mention the medicines to be used, without de∣termining their proportions, or when it may be pro∣per,
<PB N="vii" REF="010575_0008_0F80D16121F2AC80"/>
either to omit, or prefer any one of them to another; for every practitioner ought to know, how they should be adjusted to the different ages and constitutions of his patients.</P>
<P>At the end of this is another ESSAY on the <HI>Crises</HI> of Fevers, which is intended to confirm the reason∣ing contained in the former; by showing that a <HI>crisis</HI> could not happen, unless the fluids had first been too much accumulated, in or near the places, whence the discharges called <HI>critical</HI> proceed, in consequence of some hinderance to a free circulation in other parts.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> In which we propose to enquire, whether an abatement of the perspiration be, indeed, the cause of so many distempers as are commonly imputed to it.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH <HI>Sanctorius</HI> proved that our bodies per∣spire freely, he seemed to have no knowledge of their imbibing any thing from without, excepting <HI>air,</HI> and therefore was not aware, that his experiments dis∣covered no more, than the difference between the per∣spiration, and moisture we absorb through the pores of the skin and lungs; but exhalation and absorption so confound each other, as makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain the true sum of either. We may be assured, however, that the discharges from the
<PB N="10" REF="010575_0011_0F80D163656691D8"/>
lungs and outer surface, are greater than such trials show them to be; since no allowance is made for whatever we imbibe, which, past all doubts, must be very considerable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A negro man who had eaten or drank but little for some days before he was gibbetted at Charlestown in March 1759, and had nothing given him after∣ward, regularly voided a large quantity of urine early every morning; but he dis∣charged no more till about the same hour next day. The reason undoubtedly was, that so long as the sun was above the horizon and warmed the air, perspiration was freer, because the fluids were more determined towards the skin thereby; but as it became colder and more damp withal in the night, the outward surface was then constricted, and the humours, consequently, being repelled towards the <HI>viscera,</HI> urine was increased, the moisture absorbed furnishing matter for it.</NOTE>. When, therefore, that authour found his weight increased, he always charged it to so much of the perspiration being detained; and ascribed to such accidents almost every disease to which mankind is liable. But this could only be a supposititious inference, for it cannot be thought that he experienced all those ill consequences in himself; and to apply the result of ex∣periments, which concerned him alone, to whatever hap∣pened to others, in whom that, as well as all the other discharges, might have proceeded in a very different man∣ner, was stretching the conclusion rather too far. In∣deed, we owe much to <HI>Sanctorius,</HI> but, still, there is no need to admit his mistakes; for it is in part owing to this condescension, that I know not what <HI>attenuants</HI> and <HI>su∣dorificks</HI> have been introduced into the practice, in order to dissolve some notional viscidness of the fluids, and promote sweats in fevers; for on those two effects, the removal of most acute diseases is thought chiefly to depend, though one of them acts in direct contradiction to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010575_0012_0F80D1641FE68100"/>Some men of great reputation have likewise adopted <HI>Sanctorius</HI>'s assertion, that five-eighths of all our food and drink ought to pass by perspiration; but this rule can∣not hold in any country, where cold and warm seasons succeed each other, whatever may happen at times du∣ring the summer. Nor is it less an errour to maintain, that the daily sum of all the discharges, should equal the quantity of our diet and drink, to keep up the same weight of body, that we may enjoy health. For to answer that great end, those excretions must vary at different times of the year; and therefore, no fixed weight can be assigned for the standard of health; because that which would be most proper at one season, might be dangerous in the highest degree at another, as will ap∣pear in the course of this essay. It seems, indeed, that this great perspiration was meant as necessary, only, in the summer; for from the <HI>autumnal equinox</HI> to the <HI>winter solstice,</HI> himself informs us, that it scarcely exceeded one pound, or was about, one-fifth part of what it had been at another time: yet he does not complain of any dis∣orders from so remarkable a difference therein, for cer∣tainly this abatement happened by degrees; and in all likelihood it might have continued thus small through∣out the month of January and for a good part of Feb∣ruary. In general, as the weather is cooler and more changeable in the spring and autumn than in summer, perspiration not only must be less then, but more vari∣able also. How dangerous therefore, or at least trouble∣some and difficult must it be, to follow his rule for the preservation of health, by reducing the body in the spring to the weight it should be of in summer, and keeping it to that poise. But this reasoning would equally
<PB N="12" REF="010575_0013_0F80D1673325EEE0"/>
hold, for preserving the like weight of body in winter, as during a warm season, by promoting perspiration to the same quantity in the former period, that it ought to be in the latter. He, moreover, says, that they would enjoy the best health, and might attain extreme age, who keep their bodies from varying <HI>much</HI> in weight. Under what limitations <HI>much</HI> is to be understood here, I know not; but we are well assured, that the perspira∣tion ought to increase with the heat of the air; else, we could not live, much less enjoy health, during very warm weather <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Lining</HI> began to fall away in March, and by the end of September lost seventeen pounds weight, but he regained that and more, before the end of February following.</NOTE>. For as the fiery particles enter our bodies along with the watery ones, and, perhaps, some portion of the air itself, unless the fluids were at the same time constantly venting, according to the expansions they are made to undergo, and also to free us of this unnatural heat, such a general overfulness must soon ensue, as would distend the vessels, past all power of contracting them∣selves; instances of which happen almost every summer to some people in Carolina. This profuse perspiration is therefore absolutely necessary, during a sultry season, to preserve a balance, between the much relaxed vessels, and highly rarified fluids. Hence it appears, that our bodies are constantly discharging the heat they absorb from without; and so languid do the vital actions be∣come, that whilst we sweat freely as we ought to do, our natural heat is really less after the summer is far ad∣vanced, than in winter. In January 1752, when the mercury fell to the 18th division, it rose in a small ther∣mometer placed under my arm, to the 97th; but in July
<PB N="13" REF="010575_0014_0F80D168B280C988"/>
that same year, when the heat of the shaded air was marked by the 101st degree, it did not rise in the same situation, above the 95th. It was just now said, that we could not live when the weather is very warm, unless the perspiration increased in proportion as the fluids were ratified. Accordingly, I sometimes have been sent for to people who were expiring, in a manner, from being too long exposed to the intense heat of the sun, and others were already dead before I could reach them, though but a few doors from me. The first symptoms perceived on these occasions, are an universal languid∣ness and a faintish sort of drowsiness; presently such a tightness is felt round the breast as if it were strongly girded, so that the person can scarcely breathe; and then but slowly. Soon after he falls, as it were, into a pro∣found sleep; from which if he cannot be speedily roused, death quickly follows. In such cases, I commonly found the skin rather dry and very hot; the countenance full and flushed; all the outward veins very much distended; and on the breast, and other places, inflammations might be perceived, as in the <HI>scarlet fever,</HI> or a slight <HI>erysipelas,</HI> the whole body appearing enlarged and fuller than in health; but the redness we speak of in the skin, only happened a little while before the patient's death. The putrefaction in those who die after this manner, is always sudden and great; which makes it necessary to bury them in a few hours; nor does the heat their bodies acquired, abate so much after death as in other carcasses, for the time they lie uninterred. But these things by the bye—</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Lining</HI> (who was very exact) sometimes found himself heavier by several ounces, than he was a few
<PB N="14" REF="010575_0015_0F80D169741626F8"/>
hours before, though he perspired sensibly all the while, from several parts of his body, besides what passed from the lungs; hence it seems, that perspiration and absorp∣tion may both go on freely together: But he often times abated the perspiration designedly, without any perceive∣able injury, so that the matter detained, either was not so pernicious as is commonly thought, or his body must have been quickly freed of it by some other discharge. So earnest was he to know what might be the conse∣quence of checking this suddenly that he some times ex∣posed himself at once to the wind, when sweating profusely. But this curiosity was not always gratified without dis∣agreeable effects. In particular, at the beginning of July, having only an open thin linen waistcoat over his shirt, he sat from eleven to noon in a close room where the heat was marked by the 87th degree of Fahrenheit's ther∣mometer; and in that one hour perspiring eleven and an half ounces, he instantly removed into an open passage through which the wind blew briskly, the mercury fal∣ling there to 82; and in one hour and a quarter gained six and an half ounces, though he still sweated from some parts. The whole of this must surely be charged to ab∣sorption, and consisted either of the perspiration with which his linen was damped, or elementary water im∣bibed from the air, not more than 13 or 14 degrees colder than his blood, which of itself, was not likely to do much harm. However, let us even grant that some of the perspiration was detained here, yet the quantity thereof, together with whatever else was absorbed, did not occasion any great fulness or <HI>plethora;</HI> nor could a pu∣trescence ensue immediately. But such experiments were unsafe on another seere; and this we speak of, was pre∣sently
<PB N="15" REF="010575_0016_0F80D16A2F3645F0"/>
followed by gripings, and a painful weariness chiefly affecting the legs, knees and thighs; however those symptoms went off on his having some plentiful stools. Were not those effects owing to the sudden strong constrictions which the outward vessels and membranes were made to undergo, by the cooler air; the hinderance thence arising to the motion of the blood through those parts, from which it was repelled and made to accumulate in the abdominal viscera; where, happily, for him, the secretions were soon increased so as to vent off the redun∣dant humours? Let those who can judge of the laws that obtain in the animal oeconomy determine this question.—</P>
<P>Perspiration can never be stopped in a living body; and the reasons assigned for diseases from an abatement of it are, that not only a <HI>plethora</HI> is thereby brought on, but the humour itself is supposed so putrescent, as makes it in the highest degree dangerous, to have any part there∣of detained, even for a short time. Were it, indeed, true, that five-eighths of our food and drink ought to pass that way, and were it possible that this discharge could be suppressed for a number of days together, the appetite continuing good all the while, alarming overfulnesses undoubtedly would ensue, unless the other excretions increased according as the perspiration diminished. But we are well assured, that for much the greatest part of the year, the common quantity of this discharge falls far short of the above proportion in Carolina, where the climate is warmer than in Italy; <HI>Sanctorius</HI> himself found it so for three months, and he might have extended the time still farther, as already hath been said.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="010575_0017_0F80D16B29C6C360"/>That there ought to be somewhat of a regular pro∣ceeding in this discharge as requisite to health, no one can doubt; and we may say the same of all the other excretions, which should have certain proportions, to free the body in different ways, of such things as were <HI>acrid</HI> when first taken in; became so afterward; or having served the ends for which they were admitted, ought then to be expelled, to make way for fresh supplies. As to the quality of that humour which passes the pores of the skin, those who confide in the doctrine of <HI>Sanctorius,</HI> would do well to distinguish the notion of <HI>putrefaction</HI> from <HI>putres∣cence;</HI> for, some part of the milk only excepted, all ani∣mal fluids are <HI>putrescent</HI> under certain circumstances, though a tendency thereto can never happen, so long as they circulate regularly; for this implies a good con∣dition of the whole <HI>system.</HI> But, why this subtilest of all should be the most so, and of course disposed to infect the rest of the fluids immediately, more especially in a constitution, that, perhaps but an hour before, was in the best state, does not clearly appear. We know that the thin excrements may be again absorbed, without ill consequences, though they had been mixed with things that were nearly putrid in the intestines. Nor can it be with reason conceived, why the perspiration should be more liable to <HI>putrefaction</HI> than the <HI>urine,</HI> which though it consists rather of grosser and perhaps more corruptible parts than the insensible discharge, yet pro∣duces no bad effects when refunded into the blood. Of this any person may be presently convinced, by ex∣ercising so briskly, as make himself sweat for an hour or two; when little urine will remain to be voided, though the bladder had been so full before, as occasioned
<PB N="17" REF="010575_0018_0F80D16BA1A6A790"/>
a strong desire to empty it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When the urine is <HI>analized,</HI> it yields a <HI>tartarous</HI> salt, composed of an <HI>alkaline</HI> earth, and a small quantity of oil and an acid, which is found adhering to chamber-pots, that are not duly cleansed. 2dly, An <HI>ammoniacal</HI> salt, which is gene∣rated from a mixture of volatile with acid salts; so that, if a little <HI>alkaline</HI> salt or quicklime, be added to inspissated urine, a volatile urinous smell will im∣mediately ensue; as when those ingre∣dients are mixed with crude <HI>salt ammoniac,</HI> 3dly, A fixed salt, which is partly <HI>alkaline,</HI> and in part <HI>neutral,</HI> as common salt is. <HI>Vide</HI> opera Hoffmanni in folio, pag. 69.</P>
<P>We shall by and by enquire, whether the perspiration and urine be not nearly, if not quite the same, with this difference, however, that the insensible perspiration may not contain such gross <HI>saline, sul∣phureous</HI> and <HI>earthy</HI> parts as pass by urine. Whence then does the latter derive so de∣leterious a disposition, for all those con∣tents existed before in the fluids when the person was in health; and the like principles are also found in the other ex∣cretions, of the best regulated constitu∣tions? Neither will the supposal avail, that, as being a humour of the last <HI>con∣nection,</HI> it, for that reason, must be the most <HI>putrescent,</HI> for, even in this respect, it is only on a foot with the other natural discharges; which being severally secreted and excreted in the due order of time, must therefore be perfectly concocted. It ought, however, to be observed, that those contents of the urine only appeared in the above manner after they were concen∣trated, and perhaps heightened by the great heat used in such processes; but were much less active, when diffused throughout the circulating fluids.</P>
<P>I would further take notice, that per∣spiration is, perhaps, the only discharge that cannot be wholly stopped, as the urine and stools often times are for several days together, without very dangerous consequences; and both may be taken up again by the vessels, and circulate a new with the fluids, as already hath been said. In dropsies, be the patient's drink ever so plentiful, little urine will be ex∣creted in proportion; so that whatever ought to have passed that way, must in such cases be lodged in the <HI>cellular mem∣brane,</HI> or cavities of the body, together with the <HI>serous</HI> parts of the blood, where they may continue stagnated, for some months, without fatal effects. When, therefore, a patient recovers from a dropsy, nothing seems more plain, than that the humours which had lain so long in a state of rest, must first be absorbed, before they can either be expelled through any of the excreting organs, or assimilated again in the course of circulation, as the vessels recover strength. It is needless to say much of those <HI>extravasations</HI> that happen from contusions, in which the blood that had for many days been deprived of mo∣tion, is again dissolved and absorbed, with∣out any injury, though the contrary might be expected; for here as well as in a dropsy, some degree of <HI>putrefaction</HI> might be looked for. But as there are small and often times no evidences at all thereof on those and many other occa∣sions, I have thought <HI>that</HI> term was fre∣quently <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with in speaking of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P></NOTE>. Surely no man in his senses, will believe that the perspiration can possibly be so <HI>acrid</HI> or <HI>caustical,</HI> as the matter which gives the <HI>small-pox;</HI> but though inoculation informs us of the instant of time the fluids are infected, yet it commonly requires six or seven
<PB N="18" REF="010575_0019_0F80D16C6746AC18"/>
days, before they are so generally tainted thereby to pro∣duce a fever, in order to expel the <HI>morbifick</HI> cause: And the same, probably, may be said of other contagious diseases, though we cannot always ascertain the exact time, when the patients received the first seeds of these disorders. But if a person in health, happens to sicken presently after going out of a warm room into the open air, the mode is to impute the distemper to a check of the perspiration; whereas in truth, we ought to look for another cause for such sudden violent effects.</P>
<P>But were the matter we perspire really so disposed to putrefaction, it might with reason be expected, that having brought on a fever of many days, it would in that time become so putrid, (from the many circum∣stances which then concurred to make it so) that it would give better proofs thereof, than it commonly does. Yet we are seldom sensible of much acrimony in the fluids, as they pass so many fine irritable canals in their way to the skin, either before or during the <HI>critical sweat,</HI> though <HI>that</HI> is supposed to free the body of the <HI>morbifick</HI> cause, which, according to the <HI>Sanctorian doctrine,</HI> consists of somewhat very <HI>acrid,</HI> or destructive of health. To me it seems, that were the perspiration really so vicious in its own nature, as immediately to dispose the fluids to putrefaction, its acrimony, or whatever else such mis∣chievous properties are derived from, would be so heightened by a fever, that the <HI>sweats,</HI> so much wished for at those times, could not happen, because of the con∣strictions it might occasion on the fine exhaling vessels by irritation. Nor would the urinary organs be exempt from the like effects, so that the expultion of the <HI>febrifick matter</HI> would be prevented either way.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010575_0020_0F80D16D2C3C5740"/>The advantages arising from poultices and fomenta∣tions, and the spreading of contagious diseases, among other things, plainly prove, that we receive the steams which exhale from other bodies. It is also true that each individual person in a large company, may, without any present or future inconveniency, imbibe some of the perspiration which was discharged from a great number of people, of very different constitutions, even after it had been diffused in the most promiscuous manner, through the heated air of a room. But when any person sickens, after being in so crowded an assembly (where he sweated profusely), the reason commonly given is this plain, and not less true one, that he was injured by going out of a warm apartment into the cool damp air, heated as he then was.</P>
<P>But, there are fevers which attack, when no sensible abatement of the perspiration can be impeached; on the contrary, it proceeded freely, sometimes too profusely, before they came on, and continued plentiful, or with short interruptions only, throughout those diseases. And we likewise know, that this discharge is small, for several months together, at some seasons, with great advantage to many. On the whole, we have good grounds to be∣lieve, that neither this nor any of the other natural ex∣cretions, are limited to exact or stated rules, but vary not only in different people at the same time, but even in the same men daily, who yet enjoy health.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Lining</HI>'s tables shew, that when the urine was greatest, perspiration was always least, and the contrary. Hence it seems, that in countries where hot and cold
<PB N="20" REF="010575_0021_0F80D16DF98985D0"/>
weather succeed each other, the fluids are determined in a fuller stream toward the skin at one season, and are again more repelled into the <HI>viscera</HI> at another. For this reason, the discharges from within or through the out∣ward pores, must increase or diminish by turns, accord∣ing as the humours are more or less directed one way or the other. The difference therefore between the urine and perspiration, might not be great at the year's end, as Dr. <HI>Lining</HI> discovered, though the excess was in favour of the former, because the weather was uncommonly cool, during the twelve months he made his experiments.</P>
<P>As such a conformity appears in the quantity of those two discharges, the augmentation of one seems intended to make up for any defect in the other, which must of course happen on a change in the weather. They also are the best suited to answer the great end of becoming substitutes for each other, as being the most considerable of all the excretions. And though one may not increase exactly, in the same proportion as the other lessens, yet they seem to act reciprocally as counterpoises, when the weight of the fluids and strength of the vessels are pretty well adjusted.</P>
<P>To shew the truth of what hath been said, of the dif∣ference in those two discharges during hot and cold weather, let us take the <HI>medium</HI> of the perspiration for twenty-four hours in July, and compare this with its mean quantity for the same space of time in February, they will then respectively be as eighty-seven to thirty-seven: A plain proof how greatly the perspiring vessels were dilated, and how much more plentiful was the flow
<PB N="21" REF="010575_0022_0F80D16EA4264D90" MS="y"/>
of the fluids towards the outward arteries in the summer than in winter. Again, if the mean quantity of the urine for twenty-four hours in February, be compared with its medium also for the same time in July, they will be as seventy-eight to forty-four nearly. The difference therefore between the greatest perspiration in summer, and most urine in the winter, does not exceed nine ounces in twenty-four hours: But the difference be∣tween the smallest perspiration, and least urine in the most opposite seasons, was no more that seven ounces; an amazing correspondence! though to the unthinking part of mankind, those things pass unheeded, as if they bore no sort of proportion.</P>
<P>But a greater agreement still appears between those two secretions than results merely from such a conformity in their quantities, by which they seem intended to sup∣ply each others defects at different times of the year. And if they really do so, as is likely beyond a bare pro∣bability, it ought to follow, that the matter which passes both ways, should be nearly, if not quite the same; and that it is, an easy experiment will show. For, if a small quantity of the perspiration from the lungs, be collected by blowing in a clean wine glass, and some urine is made in another, (both being taken fasting, or before the hu∣mours have been diluted with fresh <HI>chyle</HI>), any person having an acute taste and smell, will at once pronounce that both are urine. Should a little salt of tartar be ad∣ded to each, a slightly volatile, but not disagreeable, smell will arise from both; and if they be permitted to stand for a day, without having any thing mingled with them, a more acrid taste and scent will then be perceived; the
<PB N="22" REF="010575_0023_0F80D16F68DA7730"/>
urine, however, being still most pungent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the general perspiration from the greatest part of the outer surface and the lunes, particular drains seem appoint∣ed to free the neighbouring parts, of some more highly saline and sulphureous matter. For what perspires from behind the ears, from the gums, arm-pits, groins and be∣tween the toes, hath a raneid offensive smell, which differs in each place. So that could the whole perspiration be col∣lected together, there is no room to doubt, it would make a mixture, full as acrimonious as the urine is.</NOTE>. Moreover, no∣thing seems more plain, than that those salts which pass with the urine in temperate seasons, are discharged through the skin when the weather is very warm; for black gloves which have been worn, in such a season, till they were wet with sweat, will be covered with a crust of white salt when dry; and our sweat also has the same saltish taste. What we then perspire, smells at first as fresh blood; but after some hours, it communicates a urinous scent and yellow colour to our linen: So that if those things do not amount to a full proof, they make it extremely probable, that the perspiration and urine, free the body in different ways of much the same sort of matter; and that what perspires from the outward sur∣face and lungs, is the same as urine in the kidneys. The pores of the skin are so many channels, intended to clear the external parts of whatever hath become useless and unfit to be detained there; the lungs and passages leading to them, perform the same office for the breast and neighbouring parts; the kidneys and intestines doing the like for the lower <HI>viscera;</HI> so that, according to their various situations, they severally contribute to the same great ends. And, though the chief excretions seem to go on without any established rules, in various climates, and in the inhabitants of the same country, at dif∣ferent seasons, or even in the same persons from day to
<PB N="23" REF="010575_0024_0F80D170E714E9D0"/>
day; some making more urine, whilst less passes by per∣spiration, the contrary being the habit of another, yet all of them may enjoy health, so the requisites of their se∣veral constitutions be but answered either way.</P>
<P>Were it indeed true, that a <HI>pletbora</HI> from an abate∣ment of the perspiration must of course happen, before inflammatory fevers can attack, it might be expected, that such disorders would be most common in the sum∣mer, because a much greater quantity thereof may be de∣tained in a short time, <HI>that discharge</HI> being then greatest, and the fibres very lax and irritable, which renders them susceptible of strong spasmodick contractions from slight∣er causes. It, however, falls out quite otherwise, for such diseases seldom appear with us at that season, but mostly in the winter and spring, when perspiration is little, and, consequently, less likely to produce the over∣fulness so much contended for. But at no time can such an addition be made to the circulating fluids thereby, in any equal number of hours, as by eating and drinking plentifully, and even intemperately, according to the daily custom of many, without much inconveniency, at least, for the present, though several pounds of fresh chyle, the produce, perhaps, of an ill judged mixture of meats and drinks, pass into their vessels oftener than once in the day. It may probably be said here, that the excretions are still going on, and therefore, whatever overfulness may happen from such excesses, are abate∣ing every moment. But is not this equally true on a diminution of the perspiration? for though the out∣ward pores may be occasionally straitened, yet that dis∣charge is still proceeding from the lungs, and it may be
<PB N="24" REF="010575_0025_0F80D1719EA48F08"/>
more plentifully, because a greater quantity of blood must circulate through that organ in all fevers, suppose∣ing no hemorrhage or any excessive increase of the ab∣dominal secretions happens in the mean time; besides that urine also is commonly augmented at such times; so that perspiration is the only discharge whose defects can be compensated by another channel. It hath been said, that no great plethora can happen from an interception of the perspiration; yet, for the sake of argument, let us even grant, that somewhat of an overfulness may at times ensue from that cause; but then might we not ex∣pect this would be removed, and that the fever it occa∣sioned ought to cease, after repeated bleedings, sweatings and the like evacuations so commonly made in such cases; more especially as the appetite fails for every thing, ex∣cept drink or thin nourishment, which soon passes off. Nevertheless the disease too often continues, though the patient is so emptied, that he can scarcely be known. Besides, nothing is so notorious, as that the body some∣times is exceedingly wasted by a fever of a few days, though no artificial evacuations had been made, and little passed by any of the sensible discharges; the patient also having all this while been well supplied with suitable diet. No way then remains to account for this great loss of substance, but by supposing the perspiration to have been vastly increased, from the lungs mostly, for the skin, tongue and throat, are at times dry and parched on those occasions.</P>
<P>Whether those things will be considered in the same light by others, I know not; but to me it seems, that whatever <HI>plethora</HI> may ensue, from a temporary and
<PB N="25" REF="010575_0026_0F80D1742E9AC558"/>
partial check of the perspiration (for partial it must be), cannot of itself so often bring on a fever, as already hath been said, if it can at all. For according to <HI>Sanctorius</HI> himself, were the whole of it detained, it would only make an addition of one pound to the fluids in twenty-four hours, from the autumnal equinox to the winter solstice; or of thirty-seven ounces in the space of one day and night in February, according to Dr. <HI>Lining;</HI> and supposing still, which yet can scarcely be, that the whole of this were matter that ought to have perspired, without any addition being made to it, by the moisture absorbed from the air. However, this is only mentioned in order to give the argument its full scope, but without admitting that an entire stop can possibly be put to the perspiration, so long as the humours circulate at all.</P>
<P>If a dangerous overfulness cannot well arise from a detention of the perspiration, in the common course of things, as little is its supposed proneness to putrefaction likely to bring on a violent disease so suddenly, as often∣times happens to people who, but a few hours before, were healthy and strong; for surely it is difficult to con∣ceive, how either the quantity or quality of that fluid which might occasionally be intercepted, could excite such distressing and hazardous effects in so small a time. I would ask those who maintain the doctrine we have been censuring, Whether it can fairly be imputed to an abatement of the perspiration, that a person on going out of a warm room into the cool moist air, or that the man who drinks cold water, or sits down on the damp ground when he is much heated with exercise, shall immediately shiver, and have a fever, pleurisy, or quinsy?
<PB N="26" REF="010575_0027_0F80D174C8A17130"/>
That one who plunges himself into the water whilst he is sweating freely, shall instantly become rigid, insen∣sible and die in a few hours? or that those who are ex∣posed to rain in the summer, or sleep only for a little while out of doors at night during that season, shall pre∣sently be cramped al over, and have a <HI>tetanus,</HI> or some other dangerous disease? Many instances in all those ways have I known, and such effects ought undoubtedly to be ascribed to some other cause, than a diminution of the perspiration alone: We also know for certain, that this discharge undergoes remarkable checks, for many hours together, without much inconveniency, as almost every man can recollect to have happened to himself on various occasions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the immediate cause of Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH it be not the lot of man to enjoy con∣stant health, many persons however are happily en∣dowed with such well constructed constitutions, that, for a number of years together, the vessels every where have proper strength, and continue so flexible withal, that the fluids they contain, can pass freely from the heart to all parts of the body, and return without any hinderance to that organ. Under circumstances like these, every part receives only its natural proportion of the blood; the several secretions and excretions will be made in regular order; and as no redundance can happen, so nothing will fall short, till the equality of action and re-action that subsisted between the solids and fluids is interrupted; and then the <HI>natural, vital and ani∣mal functions</HI> must be disordered in proportion. It therefore seems plain that when any man is attacked with a fever, in whom the constitution was so well disposed immediately before, the fault could not have been in the fluids; for they neither exceeded in quantity, nor erred in quality, but in the vessels alone, owing to some change in the condition of their coats; for, past all doubts, they are not now in the same state as before; and according to the alteration they have undergone, so must more or less of disorder ensue in the distribution of the blood, and consequently in all things that depend on its regular circulation.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="010575_0029_0F80D1763A6A1A00"/>I know but two ways, in which the equality of mutual action between the solids and fluids can be broken in upon, or, in other words, that a disease can happen; namely, when the vessels are so distended by an un∣natural rarefaction of the humours, that they cannot cir∣culate freely; but such an expansion seldom occasions a distemper in temperate climates; and must then be owing to too much heat, a close confined air, or such as does not gravitate sufficiently, whence sudden death sometimes ensues. Nor does any thing prevent the blood from being expanded by the natural heat of our bodies, so as to destroy us, but that this is checked and kept within bounds by the superiour spring of the ves∣sels. Disorders of this sort, however, not being the sub∣ject of our present inquiry, we shall pass to the other, which is by far the most common cause of diseases.</P>
<P>It is very singular, that almost every fever should be preceeded by a sense of coldness in some degree; and the greater this, and longer its continuance, the more dangerous for the most part is the disorder. This chil∣liness may come on suddenly; but, more frequently, the patient hath successive chills and flushings, perhaps, for some days; and in the mean time, an irksome sort of weariness is perceived, chiefly about the legs, knees and thighs, together with a listlessness of the other parts, and of the mind also; yet, all this while, the pulse, though somewhat hard, may not be much quickened. Those sensations of coldness, return oftener and continue longer, more especially if the person exposes himself to the wind; and the other symptoms likewise increase, till at last a strong shivering or <HI>horror</HI> comes on. At this
<PB N="29" REF="010575_0030_0F80D17A355EA4B8"/>
time the hands and feet are cold, the veins which lie immediately under the skin disappear, and the face to∣gether with all the other outward parts are pale, and, as it were, shrunk or contracted. An insatiable thirst at∣tends; a painful stiffness is felt in the joints and all the external muscles; but still most severely from the hips downwards. And as the fluids are now made to accu∣mulate in the internal and superiour parts, a sickness at the stomach, anxiety, quick-breathing, and head-ach en∣sue, with great heat about the <HI>epigastrium,</HI> breast and forehead, which, after some time, diffusses itself over the body and limbs, so proper care be taken. The pulse is confused, small, hard and very quick during the <HI>horror;</HI> but it becomes somewhat fuller, more soft and slow when the cold fit ceases: Yet it is common for the sick to be more or less chilly at times, throughout every acute disease, at all seasons, more especially on turning in bed, or when the clothes are lifted up, so as to admit the cool air to the skin.</P>
<P>If I judge rightly, the above symptoms clearly show, that the motion of the fluids is in some measure inter∣cepted in most, if not all, the outward vessels and mus∣cles; the small contracted pulse, points out some fault in the coats of the arteries, which are too much braced to per∣mit the blood either to enter or pass them freely; and the paleness of the face and shrinking of all the outward parts likewise make it evident, that the skin together with the contiguous membranes are spasmodically affected. It is no less worthy of observation, that this constriction took place in some degree, before any perceivable quickness happened in the pulse, and, likewise, that from the
<PB N="30" REF="010575_0031_0F80D17AD06B3388"/>
time it came on, even in the slightest manner, health was impaired in proportion. But the bad effects of it appeared still more clearly in time of the shivering; for the contraction having then not only become stronger but also more general, by communicating itself to a great number of vessels, and other membranous parts, whatever of order subsisted before, in the <HI>natural, vital, and animal oeconomy,</HI> was thereby confounded. If those things be true, as they certainly are, may we not safely conclude, that the immediate cause of feverish com∣plaints, is an unnatural constriction of the arteries in par∣ticular; and that the stronger this, and the greater num∣ber of vessels it affects, the more severe must be the distemper.</P>
<P>The outward branches of the <HI>descending aorta,</HI> are probably, most exposed to accidents of this sort, from cold or moist air, as being distributed through much the greatest part of the body, and conveying the blood to places most distant from the Heart, where its <HI>velocity and momentum are small;</HI> for which reason such constric∣tions may the easier be brought on them. And we ac∣cordingly find, that the heat fails first and most in the legs and feet; and the painful stiffness is also more per∣ceivable there than in other parts.</P>
<P>Whatever can give much pain or stimulate the nerves, so as to cause them to excite such constrictions, may bring on a fever. But we do not suppose all the arteries must be thus affected, to produce the disease, it being fully sufficient for this purpose, that so many of them should be so disordered, as will occasion an irregular
<PB N="31" REF="010575_0032_0F80D17B94AC1188"/>
distribution of the blood; and that they be kept in this state to continue the distemper. Nothing is more known, than that there are plain signs of great laxness in some vessels, whilst at the same time, others are apparently too much braced; witness the small hard pulse, and brown parched tongue in choleras and fevers with vo∣mitings, purgings, profuse sweats, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It will probably be admitted, that some degree of spasm, does, indeed, take place in time of the <HI>horror,</HI> but that this must be removed, before a general warmth can return, more especially ere the patient can sweat, or the urine become thick. But we are well assured, that distressing spasms of particular parts oftentimes happen, and yet only a hardness, without much quickness, will be perceived in the pulse, as is found in nervous and other colicks; the headaches, choakings, and some other complaints, common to hysterical and hypochon∣driacal people, in the biliary ducts during a jaundice, and even in the <HI>Tetanus</HI> itself, except during the general temporary contractions which are common to that cruel disease. So, in endeavouring to establish the above theory, it was no where insinuated, that the arteries must be so constricted, as wholly to prevent the fluids from passing; though this seems nearly the case sometimes in those of the extreme parts, during the severe <HI>horrors</HI> of <HI>quartan and tertian intermittents.</HI> But that is a state of such violence, as no constitutions can support for many hours together; and we accordingly find, that they who die of those diseases, never recover a proper warmth after the <HI>horrors</HI> attacked; either a <HI>mortal anxiety, lethargy, convulsions,</HI> or an <HI>apoplexy</HI> soon
<PB N="32" REF="010575_0033_0F80D17C25190648"/>
ensuing: Till the fatal stage of a fever, or probably just at the instant of death, this spasm may be strongest in time of the cold fit; but notwithstanding the force of it does abate (for abate it must) before the body can every where become warm, the action of the heart being now weakened, and its motions much hurried, by the precipitous return of the <HI>venous</HI> blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our most gracious Sovereign King GEORGE II. in all likelihood, could not have died so suddenly, from the burst∣ing of the right ventricle of the heart, (thin as all the vessels were said to be) unless a general forcible spasm of the coats of the arteries and other muscular membranes had preceeded, though no person happened to be present when the horror attacked. The cause of his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumber∣land's death, was more palpable; for he underwent two or three successive strong rigors or shiverings, whereby the fluids were so impetuously urged into the inter∣nal and superiour parts, that the vessels of the brain were made to give way to the violent irruption of the blood, that was thus forced upon them.</NOTE>, it neither can receive nor throw out such a quantity of that fluid, nor communicate such an <HI>impetus</HI> to it, as is ne∣cessary to dilate the constricted arteries fully; and they, in their turn, not only refuse a ready admittance, but a free passage also to the blood, as already hath been said. Besides, the coats of the arteries being rendered more elastick from the time the spasm came on, and still more so by the <HI>horror,</HI> they will maintain, the superiority they have already acquired over the feeble action of the heart, and the little resistance the fluids can make: The dis∣ease therefore will not only continue, but may even in∣crease, if the cause be not removed.</P>
<P>The same reasoning will hold exactly in those <HI>spasmo∣dical contractions,</HI> that arise from the irritation of some sort of <HI>acrimony</HI> lying in the stomach or intestines; and they also will continue till that be either corrected or ex∣pelled. As to the occasional sweats, and thick urine in
<PB N="33" REF="010575_0034_0F80D17CDE75FD28"/>
fevers, it hath been said, that the spasm needs not be very general to bring on and keep up those diseases; for a person may be dangerously ill, though only part of the system is thus affected; and even in the <HI>opisthotonos</HI> it∣self, some muscles commonly are capable of voluntary motions, whilst others are detained in an unvaried state of violent contraction. Nothing farther can be inferred from those sweats in fevers, than that the out∣ward vessels are not so strongly constricted, as wholly to intercept the fluids from passing to the exhaling canals; or that the spasm was at such times somewhat abated; the thick urine showing the same of the small <HI>emulgent arteries.</HI> But, though those unnatural contractions may abate in part, they cannot be said to have ceased, so long as the pulse is not soft, be it strong or weak, quick or slow, this hardness being a proof of too great springi∣ness in the arteries.</P>
<P>Having offered some reasons, which, at least, seem to favour my opinion of the immediate cause of fevers, it may not be amiss to point out a few of its most obvious effects; and those, with others not here mentioned, would be better understood, if the notion of some <HI>anatomists</HI> were true, that the several different orders of vessels, consist only of various arrangements of one and the same con∣tinued canal, which is every where full of fluids. Nay farther, all the flexible parts of our bodies, are, also in∣cluded in the above supposal; of which were we assured it might then be easy to account for the <HI>sympathy,</HI> that evidently takes place between one part of our bodies and another.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="010575_0035_0F80D17DA52A6B68"/>First, We observed, that from the time the spasm began, and whilst it was gaining on the vessels, the equality of reciprocal action, which subsisted before between them and the fluids, was interrupted, and health also declined in proportion to the force and extent of that contraction.</P>
<P>Secondly, As the blood was tumultuously pushed for∣wards in the viens at the time of the <HI>horror,</HI> because of the strong pressure that was then made on them, by the constriction of the skin and other <HI>muscular membranes,</HI> the coats of those vessels being likewise rendered more springy thereby, it is plain, that the heart ought either to have admitted and expelled more blood in the same time than it does in health, or performed its motions quicker. But the former not being possible, nor probable could it even receive so much, because its <HI>muscular fibres</HI> might be <HI>spasmodically affected</HI> in some degree, the latter una∣voidably happened.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Because the capacities of all the arteries, on which this spasm acts (1.), must be lessened in propor∣tion, so they can neither receive nor transmit their na∣tural quantities of the fluids, so long as they continue in that state: An overplus must therefore be admitted by others, over and above what they ought to contain, were the circulation every where free. And the stronger this check in any considerable number of vessels, the more must the blood be collected, and the greater its impetus in those that are more open and passable, as being but little or not at all affected with the spasm; un∣less where such overfulnesses happen, as disable the ar∣teries from contracting themselves properly.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="010575_0036_0F80D17E5F001C88"/>Fourthly, From this obstruction (1. 2. 3.) to the free and equal distribution of the fluids, some stop must be put to the succeeding blood; this again will be com∣municated to <HI>that</HI> which follows, and so on, till so much as cannot pass the consticted vessels, is made to recoil, by an inverted sort of circulation, on those that have not undergone any unnatural contractions, or on these that are least able to resist its weight and <HI>impulse.</HI> The over∣plus will, therefore, fall chiefly on such vessels as are na∣turally weak, or on those that are not supported by sur∣rounding muscles: And we accordingly find, that those of the <HI>viscera</HI> and <HI>brain,</HI> are always over-charged in fe∣vers, if nothing happens to vent the redundance, which else must ensue in them.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Under circumstances like those (4.) the the vessels that are thus too much distended, cannot clear themselves of this additional quantity of the blood, part∣ly, because they are so stretched thereby, that they have not the power to complete their <HI>systoles;</HI> but chiefly, for that the vessels in other parts, are not at present in con∣dition to receive their full proportions of the fluids.</P>
<P>Sixthly, When things have come to that pass (5.), supposing the spasm still gaining, and urging the fluids yet more into the internal and superiour parts, the pa∣tients strength being at the same time greatly spent, the blood will then be compelled to retire within a narrow compass; and, at last, being mostly collected in the brain, lungs, and large vessels near the heart, the small arteries in the outward and extreme parts shut themselves up; the arms and legs lose their heat, and the mus∣culous
<PB N="36" REF="010575_0037_0F80D182B5396978"/>
flesh feels hard. The aortas no longer receive the blood freely from the heart; this organ can admit but little from the <HI>vena cava</HI> and <HI>pulmonaris;</HI> the lungs also being already overfilled, receive only a small quan∣tity from the heart. But here let us stop! for to those who are much weakened, the last hour cannot now be far off. Nay, when the like symptoms happen to them, who enjoyed a good share of strength but an hour be∣fore, death must soon ensue, if they cannot be speedily relieved. They therefore who are cut off by acute dis∣eases, may with truth be said to die a violent death; for the actions of those organs on which life depends, are stopped and as it were overwhelmed by this excessive ac∣cumulation of the fluids in them, the vessels in other parts, being very generally closed at such times; so that the patients yield as <HI>victims</HI> to the vehemence of the symptoms, rather than because their bodies are drained of the resources of life. For in those distempers that prove mortal in a few days, enough of fluids often∣times remains to the last gasp to continue life, were the vessels but in condition to circulate them regularly. On the other hand, when any person sinks under a hemorr∣hage, cholera, purging, spitting, or other sudden or slow discharges, the body is in the end so deprived of its juices, that a sufficiency of them is not left to fill the remote small vessels; which, for want of the usual re∣sistance to their contractibleness, and because the <HI>pro∣jectile force</HI> of the heart is then very small, shut them∣selves up to their axes.</P>
<P>It is needless to recount more effects of this supposed unnatural constriction, for any others that can happen in
<PB N="37" REF="010575_0038_0F80D18350D73BC8"/>
the course of feverish diseases, may easily be understood from the same manner of reasoning. And though, hap∣pily, this spasm does not always produce fatal conse∣quences, yet, what we have related will appear in some degree in every fever, unless the symptoms be abated by some discharge or other, to prevent the overfulnesses that else must ensue, in the internal and superiour vessels.</P>
<P>Should those things be true, may not many symptoms which are daily seen in fevers, be easily accounted for, from the irregular distribution of the fluids, that hap∣pens in consequence of this <HI>spasmodick constriction of the arteries,</HI> whereby the blood is strongly repressed from some parts, and made to accummulate in others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hippocrates</HI> seemed clearly to be of the same opinion; for, in his chapter <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, he expresly says, <Q>Efficiunt [horr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e] ut in a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia loca parcior, in alia jus<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ò copiosior sanguis <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur; ex quo stas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, stagnationes, in partibus im∣becillioribus productre, graves et mul∣tas producunt aegritudines—Prohibe∣tur sanguinis cursus, at{que} alio quidem loco consistit, alio lentius penetrat, qua sanè inaequalitate transitus sangui∣nis per corpus facta, omni<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enae ir <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣qualitates per omne corpus contingunt. —Sanguis [praesentem horrorem me∣tuens] ab extremis corporis partibus, quae exsangues, et propter frigus pal∣pitant, decidit, et concurrit ad locos maxime calido<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; et ob sanguinis ibi collecti abundant am, suscitari calorem, ad extrema demum exeuntem.</Q></NOTE>? or, whether before a spasm attacks, the solids must have been over springy, and the blood too compact, else a <HI>pleurisy, inflammatory peripneumony, or a quinsy</HI> could not come on.</P>
<P>It will probably be objected, that in those complaints the blood is evidently inflamed, as appears from the yel∣low or pale tough skin, with which its surface is covered; the red part or grume being likewise larger and the se∣rum commonly less in quantity than in health. But setting aside the consideration, of the effect cold air may
<PB N="38" REF="010575_0039_0F80D18437C680E0"/>
have in contributing to those appearances, when that fluid is exposed to it in a state of rest, we will even al∣low the blood to be really more dense in inflammatory fevers; yet it is not less true, that it was by no means so, before its velocity had been unnaturally augmented, and it sustained a continued strong com∣pression, from the great force the arteries acquired, to∣gether with other consequences of those causes. But, let the constrictions be removed, so that a regular circula∣tion may follow, the fever with its painful symptoms will then cease, and, in a little time, no such <HI>viscidness</HI> will be seen, because the blood soon recovers its proper con∣sistence, after regaining a free and equal distribution throughout the system, and is no longer under the like restraints in passing the vessels.</P>
<P>It is commonly thought, that persons of strong full habits, are most liable to inflammatory distempers; but the effects of this spasm will be the same in weakly people, though no <HI>plethora</HI> took place before, provided the weather favours those disorders; and the like tough skin will also be seen on their blood, but not in so great a degree. I have often times known women seized with severe <HI>pleurisies, peripneumonies,</HI> or <HI>quinsies,</HI> after being much weakened by an abortion, or a flooding. The same complaints have likewise been brought on tender subjects by a <HI>colick;</HI> for the constrictions, that in this case arose at first in the stomach, from the irritation of an <HI>acid acrimony,</HI> being communicated by sympathy to the outward small vessels, a <HI>horror</HI> thence ensued; and whenever that happens, be the cause what it will, more or less of fever must ensue; the disease, most common∣ly
<PB N="39" REF="010575_0040_0F80D184695E2A08"/>
being of that sort which then prevails, no matter of whatever age or constitution the patient may be. Ac∣cordingly, we see the strongest men have intermittents, or fevers of the depressed kind in July and August; and on the other hand, puny persons and infants also, are liable to inflammatory disorders in the winter.</P>
<P>I will further observe, that acute distempers seldom continue with the same violence and intenseness of heat; for very commonly the patients have either sensible or obscure chillinesses at times; and then it may be justly concluded, that the spasm is still gaining and the disease increasing in consequence. At the time of those chilli∣nesses, the pulse is more quick, hard and small, and all the former symptoms are heightened; for such shiver∣ings truly are <HI>horrors,</HI> which not only aggravate the <HI>spasm</HI> that acted before, but make it extend to a greater number of vessels, whereby the disorder will at least be prolonged. Such occasional shiverings should therefore be prevented if possible, by keeping the patients pro∣perly covered, according to the weather, for every time the cold air hath access to their bodies, those <HI>horrors</HI> will more certainly come on, especially in the winter.</P>
<P>If I have not explained myself clearly on the nature of the <HI>spasm</HI> I meant to establish, let us suppose it were possible, to have all the vessels of the human body laid open to view; the heart at the same time propelling the blood throughout the system, and receiving it back again from the veins, as is regularly done in health, here, were a pressure made on any considerable number of arteries, so as to straiten them in an equal degree
<PB N="40" REF="010575_0041_0F80D18520EC7398"/>
with the <HI>morbifick constriction</HI> we suppose, the vessels in other places would be seen to swell; and the more nu∣merous those that are pressed, and greater the weight applied, the more would the fluids be made to retire thence and accumulate in others, where overfulnesses must ensue, in proportion to the check given to the progress of the blood through the confined vessels. All this is plain enough, and somewhat of the same sort as cer∣tainly happens, whenever the coats of the arteries are <HI>spasmodically</HI> affected.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the cure of common, continued, and inflammatory fevers.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE for a long time thought, that, among the variety of distempers to which we are liable, <HI>fevers,</HI> in particular, have been divided in too many classes; nor are the ways of treating them less diversified. It might have been meant by this shew of exactness, to leave us as little room as possible, to mistake one disease for another; but, in my opinion, that end had been better answered by fewer principles, so they were well defined. For experience hath convinced me, that it matters not much, under what forms several acute disor∣ders appear, or whatever may be the ages or constitutions of the patients (when no particular acrimony prevails), provided the complaints agree in some circumstances with others, that are commonly believed to be of very different natures; and for no reason that I can perceive, but because some symptoms fall more on one part than another. Hence the disease hath some name, which suits well enough in conversation; but it should not be thence inferred, that any material difference ought always to be made in the manner of curing it, more especially at its first onset. For if it be granted, that a <HI>spasmodick contraction of the arteries is the immediate cause of fevers,</HI> and that the symptoms which happen in the courses of those distempers, are owing as it were to an inverted or irregular circulation of the blood, what hath
<PB N="42" REF="010575_0043_0F80D186C7B1E110"/>
just now been said, will not appear so chimerical; more especially when it is applied to such feverish complaints as attack those, who but a few hours before were in health.</P>
<P>It would be needless, to give many instances of a me∣thod I have for many years used with success, to remove common continued, or inflammatory fevers, within the first or second day, when they were not attended with a purging, which happens but seldom in the latter sort. But for an example, let us suppose a strong man to be attacked with <HI>a pleurisy;</HI> yet, though this be as dange∣rous and distressing a malady, as almost any we are liable to, it will be removed in a few hours by purging and sweating, so the discharges be but plentiful, and the pa∣tient is properly taken care of. Nor will the reason, why this management should have so good effects, be a secret to those, who recollect what hath been said on the constrictions of the external vessels, and the overfulnesses they occasion within; which being only effects of the former, are more directly abated by purging, than any other evacuation that can be made; and therefore, whatever inflammation or obstruction might have ensued from the present distended condition of the internal ves∣sels, will be prevented by those means. For great re∣peated <HI>revulsions</HI> being thus made, as it were immediately from those parts, they will be relieved in proportion, of the overcharges they sustained, by every loose stool. And as the like effects extend to all those vessels, in which any degree of <HI>plethora</HI> took place, and even to the heart and lungs, each must then act with more power, so as not only to clear themselves of whatever
<PB N="43" REF="010575_0044_0F80D1875F87F1F8"/>
plenitude might still remain in them, but also by com∣municating a brisker impulse to the blood itself the small contracted arteries will thereby be dilated by de∣grees. Farther to insure the patient's sweating, hot bricks ought to be laid at a convenient distance from the feet and legs, to assist in taking off the unnatural contrac∣tions, that we supposed were strongest thereabouts, by the kindly warmth they give those parts. The effect of this treatment is such, that, after the person hath had some large stools, and sweated plentifully at the same time, the pulse, which began to soften and fill, on the secretions being freely promoted in the <HI>abdominal viscera,</HI> will soon become slow and natural, as a proof that the spasm is removed, and the blood circulated regularly; all that was required for the cure.</P>
<P>This is my common way of reasoning, on the good effects of purging and sweating, in the early stages of fevers, but whether I judge rightly or not, the advan∣tages of such treatment, have been confirmed to me by thousands of instances. To be diligent in observing, what the same disease constantly requires to remove it, in the most speedy and effectual manner, and perfect our judgments therein, with all the certainty that experience and the nature of things will allow, is, in my opinion, the only true way, to establish a rational theory and success∣ful practice; as both would then depend on such fixed principles as must abide the test. Whether I have suc∣ceeded either way, is left to others; but this I may be allowed, that the above theory seems to justify the prac∣tice as this does the former. For, past all doubts, had not the vessels within been too much filled, to increase
<PB N="44" REF="010575_0045_0F80D188AA12CC38"/>
the excretions directly from them, and promote so many plentiful stools, must have had consequences of the most dangerous nature; and, on the other hand, had not the outward parts been too much braced or con∣stricted, then, surely, to bring on profuse sweats by relaxing them still more, had been equally pernicious.</P>
<P>When I first began to use this method, some disappoint∣ments happened, from my not attending to that material circumstance of raising and keeping up a proper heat in the legs and feet, and guarding the other parts of the body from cold air, more especially during the winter; the necessity for which did not then occur, though it was altogether consistent with the notion of a <HI>spasmodick con∣striction:</HI> But, after care was taken that way, few patients missed of relief, unless they themselves or their attend∣ants, thought it unnecessary to comply with such seem∣ingly trisling injunctions.</P>
<P>That the patients may not be obliged to get up, a warm bed-pan must always be carefully conveyed to them under the bed-clothes; and their drink and nourish∣ment should be given either with a child's feeding-boat, or through the spout of a tea-pot, as they lie covered; besides, when the bricks cool, those should be removed and hot ones put in their places, so long as may be ne∣cessary. Though the fever, together with the painful symptoms, will undoubtedly be abated by those means, yet they may not cease on this first trial. In that case, the medicine must be repeated, and the discharges pro∣moted more briskly, unless the patient be already very weak; but he must be so, in an extreme degree, to deter
<PB N="45" REF="010575_0046_0F80D189226ED1C0"/>
us from attempting his relief at once by purging and sweating, rather than suffer an expectoration to come on in a <HI>pleurisy or peripneumony;</HI> for at best, <HI>that</HI> gives only a chance to recover.</P>
<P>I ought to observe, that it is not always necessary to re∣peat the laxative, though the symptoms be not wholly removed, so the most accute are abated; for it may then be sufficient, to make a decoction of poppy-heads and anniseeds with water; and when the liquor is press∣ed out, some essence of antimony and a little sugar being added, one common spoonful of this mixture must be given every half hour, or seldomer, according to the case, till the patient sweats freely, and the fever and pain cease. A dry tickling cough is sometimes trouble∣some for a few days after, the disease is pretty well over; to allay which, I add the inspissated juice of liquorice to the decoction of poppies, and a little of the best olive-oil dissolved with extract of gum arabick, is afterward mixed with the liquor, to be given as above.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the earlier this method is pursued, so much the better will it succeed; for if the breathing had been much obstructed for some days, by a severe pain in the side or breast, this, together with the spasm which then acts on the outward vessels, will cause the fluids to accummulate in the lungs; hence a dry cough must ensue from anxiety, at the beginning of those com∣plaints; but the secretions in that part being afterwards increased by degrees, the phlegm that then lies extra∣vasated in the <HI>bronchial vesicles,</HI> will also excite a cough, by its irritation, to expel itself; and thus both the cough
<PB N="46" REF="010575_0047_0F80D189C2984A98"/>
and spitting must continue till the overfulnesses that took place in the <HI>pulmonary</HI> vessels be removed, and the pro∣fuse secretions there cease in consequence. But those things would not have happened, had the complaint been abated within the first or second day; at least they could not be either dangerous or troublesome; and, in general, the same treatment answers very well at any time before the expectoration becomes free.</P>
<P>The patient's chamber ought not to be too close or warm, nor his bed stand very near a fire, that the air he breathes may not be hot and dry. His head and breast must be raised high; and though he should be carefully covered, the bed-clothes need not be more than he used in health, except from the waist downwards, for the sweat we would bring on, will be sufficiently pro∣moted by the hot bricks, and warm drink and nourish∣ment, which should be given often, but in small quan∣tities. For those purposes, weak sage tea sweetened a little with honey, meager broth made with lean meat of any sort, and thin strained gruel, will serve in lieu of every thing else.</P>
<P>This hint for purging, I borrowed from <HI>nature;</HI> for observing when inflammatory diseases were most com∣mon, that those patients who had loosenesses at the be∣ginning of fevers, seldom were liable to complaints of the sides, breast or parts above; and also, that the dis∣tempers were generally mild and short, even in the win∣ter; or, if a <HI>pleurisy, peripneumony</HI> or <HI>quinsy</HI> came on during the present illness, this did not happen till the purging ceased; and likewise, that if the belly be∣came
<PB N="47" REF="010575_0048_0F80D18A5E792D90"/>
freely loose, on the first days of pleurisies or pe∣ripneumonies, they commonly were abated thereby: It, therefore, seemed reasonable, that a <HI>diarrhea,</HI> promoted by art, would have good effects in such cases; which ac∣cordingly fell out, and with greater advantages than were expected; but, to confess a truth, at my first setting out in this way, I underwent some serious reflections, on straying so much from the common forms of practising. Repeated purging is recommended in inflammatory <HI>quinsies;</HI> but why so carefully forbidden in the first days of <HI>pleurisies</HI> and <HI>peripneumonies,</HI> I see no reason. If this caution proceeded from fear, either to delay or prevent the expectoration that of course is expected in those disorders, one with equal probability would apprehend the same, from the large repeated bleedings that are generally made.</P>
<P>What <HI>Boerhaave</HI> says in his 830th and 888th A∣phorism, is remarkably to the point; for speaking of a peripneumony and pleurisy, he tells us, <HI>'that a great dis∣charge of bile by stool,'</HI> is one of the ways in which a <HI>crisis</HI> happens in those disorders; and his reserve <HI>'if the pa∣tient be relieved thereby,'</HI> is as applicable to the other <HI>con∣coctions and excretions,</HI> by which he says those distempers are removed before the 4th day. How a suitable in∣crease of the <HI>abdominal secretions,</HI> may relieve the vessels in the <HI>thorax</HI> of their present overfulnesses, and thereby prevent an obstruction, which might end in an inflam∣mation, I easily perceive, but cannot so readily compre∣hend the meaning of the word <HI>concoction,</HI> so commonly used in speaking of fevers, without any erruption or ten∣dency
<PB N="48" REF="010575_0049_0F80D18D957EBB38"/>
to a suppuration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>concoction,</HI> I suppose authours mean such a change wrought on the <HI>mor∣bifick cause,</HI> as renders it either inactive and inert, or prepares it for being expel∣led the body by some outlet. But in simple continued, inflammatory, or other common fevers, to speak of <HI>morbifick mat∣ter</HI> and <HI>concoction,</HI> is more likely to lead us into a labyrinth, than satisfy our judge∣ments, more especially at the beginning of those diseases, when they attack them, who just before were in health. Indeed it is quite reasonable, to apply those terms to <HI>contagious disorders,</HI> and also to fevers that arise from inflammations tending to suppuration, for there a <HI>morbifick matter</HI> is evident; but I have known the great∣est part of a large company sicken in the spring or autumn, after spending several days together, on a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arty of pleasure as it was called. Yet though they all were alike exposed to the same weather by day as well as in the night, and partook of the same intemperate exercises and irre∣gularities, one person however was pre∣sently after confined by the gout or rheu∣matism; another had the quinsy; a third a dysentery, ague, purging, tooth-ach, and so on. Here then it is plain, that the same general remote causes acted equally on them all; but it is no less true, they had as various effects on their different constitutions; yet according to the common mode of speaking, each com∣plaint here had a <HI>morbifick cause</HI> proper to itself, the nature of which let those ex∣plain, who, on all occasions, adopt such reasoning, We say with propriety, that the eruption, when complete and benign, is a crisis to the first fever in the measles and small pox; whereas in some other acute disorders, there are certain <HI>exanthe∣matous</HI> appearances, which never fail to portend death to the patients. Can any thinking man assert, that in pleurisies, peripneumonies, catarrhal fevers, or pi∣tuitous asthmas, the body is really dis∣charged of the morbifick matter by spit∣ting, which only empties the vessels that were over charged? or when a fever, quinsy, tooth-ach, head-ach, or even the distempers just now mentioned, are re∣moved by purging and sweating dextrously used at their beginnings, that this hap∣pened by our thus expelling their <HI>morbifick causes;</HI> or when the constitution is much relaxed, both as to the solids and fluids, by an intermitting fever; can it be said, that the bark (which cures merely by its bracing qualities, without promoting any one sensible excretion) then acts by ex∣pelling a <HI>morbifick matter</HI> of any sort? I would be understood, that no distempe∣rature existed in the fluids, preceding the attacks of simple acute diseases, on those who just before were in health; though it cannot be denied that fevers may bring on somewhat of this sort, and then it is to be esteemed an effect rather that the cause of the disorder, notwithstanding to may require our attention to remove it.</NOTE>. Farther, if purging be disap∣proved at the beginning of the fevers we speak of, be∣cause a plentiful <HI>diarrhea</HI> lessens and even stops the spit∣tings in the second stages of them, the effect complained of, is a direct proof of the advantages of brisk purging, at the time we recommend. For nothing shews more clearly, how sudden and great a revulsion is thereby made from the parts affected, by the humours being so
<PB N="49" REF="010575_0050_0F80D18E52CEF100"/>
hastily carried off another way; whereas, when those complaints are thus far advanced, such a waste of the fluids should by no means be made; for they ought rather to be detained then, to assist in disc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing or dis∣solving whatever obstruction or inflammation hath hap∣pened in the lungs or elsewhere. The objections, there∣fore, to purging on the first days of those complaints, are so far from having any weight, that, on the con∣trary, they really serve to establish the usefulness of it, when the vessels within are only overcharged or ob∣structed in part, and before an inflammation hath come on.</P>
<P>I follow the same method at the beginning of every common fever, when the belly is not already loose enough; for at such times, it is by no means sufficient, that the patients have stools as in health (which yet hap∣pens but seldom in the first days of inflammatory diseases), because, however well this might suit, when all the <HI>na∣tural discharges</HI> proceed in due order and proportion, something more will be necessary, now, that this harmo∣ny is broken in upon. Nor will clysters fulfill the in∣tention, as much experience hath convinced me; not to mention, that, according to the foregoing theory, there are good reasons against the use of them.</P>
<P>The advantages of removing all fevers speedily, and in particular those of the sides and lungs, are too many and great to need many words. And it is needless to show, how preferable the above method is, to the com∣mon way of bleeding the patients not only largely at once, but also repeatedly, which yet often fails to re∣move
<PB N="50" REF="010575_0051_0F80D18EE9428FA0"/>
those complaints, probably, because some rules above laid down, are not observed, I mean, as to pro∣moting sweats after such evacuations; for, let the pa∣tients lose ever so much blood, enough of that fluid will still remain to renew the pain, so the spasm of the arte∣ries be permitted to continue. Nay, it may even be∣come stronger, and communicate itself to a greater number of vessels, the more the fluids are diminished, unless care be taken to prevent this; for the latter being the only antagonists, to the strong disposition the arteries have to contraction, when this is not properly resisted, they will close themselves in proportion. Granting, however, the disease to be cured by a great loss of blood, this happens precisely by emptying the vessels, though in a less direct manner than we propose, con∣sidering the nature and seat of the complaint, but with this difference, that it weakens the patient much more than purging and sweating. Supposing after all, that the distemper is not removed by bleeding, weakened as the patient already is, his recovery will then depend on ex∣pectoration alone, which must not only be plentiful, but of a good quality also. A dangerous condition surely! for however well suited this discharge may be, we have too many fatal instances to prove, that it may be easily suppressed by various accidents; besides many ill con∣sequence oftentimes ensue, from this manner of termi∣nating those diseases. For those reasons, an expectora∣tion should not be suffered to come on at all, if by any means they can be cured without it. But it is worthy of remark, that when recovery is effected even that way, it is really compleated at last, in the manner we propose at first, by emptying the internal vessels at once,
<PB N="51" REF="010575_0052_0F80D18FAF52A790"/>
which is gradually done by the spitting; but with much more hazard to the patient. One the whole, be the se∣verity of those distempers abated by whatever means, a sweat will nevertheless come on sooner or latter; when, and not before, the pulse becomes slow and natural, in evidence that the spasmodick constrictions of the arteries are then removed, as already hath been said.</P>
<P>In some countries, bleeding may perhaps be more necessary in inflammatory fevers, than I have generally found it in <HI>South-Carolina;</HI> yet, be this operation so needful or not here, it is no where more practised. Those who are of opinion, that they ought not to de∣part from a rule, which hath so long been as it were universally established, may order some blood to be taken away if they please, so the patient be strong; but I seldom do, unless the disorder had been of some days continuance, or the pain in the side so acute, to obstruct breathing greatly, and thus occasion the fluids to accumulate in a high degree in the lungs, be∣cause, for the most part, much bleeding weakens the sick rather than gives lasting relief. For though the pain abates sometimes, during the flow of blood from the vein, and may be easier for a small time after, it will surely return, so the spasm continues, when every thing remains still to be done, as if no blood had been lost. I therefore depend on purging and sweating, being mo∣rally certain of success that way, provided the dischar∣ges be plentiful, and things are properly conducted in other respects.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="010575_0053_0F80D19066413E50"/>By this method, women have been cured of <HI>pleurisies</HI> and <HI>peripneumonies</HI> in every stage of pregnancy, though inflammatory diseases are known to be full of danger to such subjects. One, in particular, being seized with an <HI>acute pleurisy</HI> in the eighth month after concep∣tion, was effectually relieved in less than twelve hours; and she was as speedily recovered of a relapse, brought on by her going into a wet room, on the third day after the first illness, though the latter attack was equally se∣vere with the former; and in the space of seven weeks she was delivered of a healthy child. Another of a middling constitution, who relapsed twice into the same distemper in the space of three weeks, was at each time so soon freed of it, that her strength was but little im∣paired, after having been thrice seized with the <HI>pleurisy</HI> within so short a time. But in truth, the patients sel∣dom are more weakened by that distemper, when treated in the above manner at the beginning of it, than com∣monly happens from any other smart fever, of equal continuance. May I be allowed to observe, that had those two women been managed in the most approved usual way, the chance to recover, would have been much against them. I do not confine this practice to our natives alone, but apply it to the strongest Europe∣ans, when attacked with those diseases, on their first landing here in the winter, and the success is alike in both.</P>
<P>I am not over anxious about the choice of medicines; but avoiding such as are very irritating, and as there still is a preference, I chiefly use <HI>manna, Epsom salt, elixir salutis, Kermes mineral</HI> rightly prepared, <HI>essence of anti∣mony,
<PB N="53" REF="010575_0054_0F80D19135830150"/>
salt of tartar, magnesia, &amp;c.</HI> which being variously combined, are made either in mixtures with water, or in powders, together with some drops of chemical oil, either of <HI>mint,</HI> or some other aromatick plant. But in what∣ever form they be administered, the ingredients ought to be so proportioned, that by giving a small dose of the composition every hour, the expected operation may be brought on, by the time the patient hath taken it four or five times; and whenever he begins to purge, the medicine ought to be discontinued, for more stools will follow, which, together with the sweat that soon comes on, often remove the disease at once, or leave us little more to do. Every thing however ought to be given warm for some days; and the patient should lie in bed at least forty-eight hours, having hot bricks near his feet, more especially during the winter, to prevent his catching cold, which would surely bring on a relapse; for the solids being still very <HI>irritable,</HI> a <HI>spasmodick constriction</HI> will now be more easily brought on, than if they had not so lately been affected that way. And for the like reason, he must afterwards expose himself by degrees to the open air; in the middle of the day for some time, and then only, when the weather is fair and warm; but if it be cold, he ought to be confined some days longer to bed, with hot bricks to his feet, in case he perceives himself chilly, or those parts have not a good warmth.</P>
<P>Though a tedious or dangerous spitting will be pre∣vented by those means, it must yet be confessed, that a small cough and pain in the side sometimes remain; but without any other marks of a fever, than some de∣gree of hardness in the pulse; and this will more cer∣tainly
<PB N="54" REF="010575_0055_0F80D191DDDF1070"/>
happen, if the disease continued some days, be∣fore relief was sought: Those symptoms, however, very commonly yield to such a decoction of poppies, as al∣ready hath been mentioned; but the person ought still to be carefully guarded against cold, and have all things given him warm. The side, likewise, should be cauti∣ously bathed with a mixture of brandy, spirit of sal am moniac and laudanum (or opium had better be dissolved in the brandy), the part being afterward cover∣ed with a flannel squeezed hot out of the same spirit, and a warm tile laid over all. Or a plaister of galba∣num, mixed with a litile opium and camphor, may be applied to the place.</P>
<P>I would remark here, how improbable the common opinion is, that too braced a state of the solids, and great compactness in the blood, should be such necessary circumstances to dispose us to <HI>inflammatory diseases,</HI> as we are told. For supposing a <HI>pleurisy</HI> removed, within the first twenty four hours from its attacking a strong man, no∣thing more frequently happens in this country, than to see it followed, in a day or two, by a <HI>quotidian</HI> or <HI>ter∣tian</HI> intermittent; though diseases of this sort, do not require such a constitution to favour their appearing, as those of a contrary character are thought to do. Nor do I scruple to give the bark to such patients, without regarding their having been so lately ill of an inflam∣matory distemper; but then I begin with the decoction, and add laxatives and diaphoreticks to it, for the first two three days.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="010575_0056_0F80D1965BF3D688"/>Every physician of the smallest attention, must have observed a remarkable difference in the forms of diseases, owing to the temporary changes our constitutions un∣dergo from the weather, in the several seasons of the year; and accordingly, the <HI>spasm</HI> we speak of must have various effects. Thus we see, that some of the excretions are at times much abated thereby, whilst others are not increas∣ed in proportion; and again, it promotes excessive dis∣charges, either by stool, urine, uterine or other he∣morrhages, according as the vessels in different places are disposed to vent the fluids, with which they happen to be overcharged. And when the resistance to their flowing towards any one part, hath once been lessened, by an increased discharge made from it, they will rush that way in a freer stream, so long as any degree of spasm continues on the arteries elsewhere. On some∣what of this nature, depends the difficulty we find in checking <HI>profuse sweats, diarrheas, catarrhal spittings,</HI> and other irregular <HI>excretions</HI> of long standing, though no remarkable fever attends; because the vessels whence they proceed, have become so dilated and weak, that their powers of contraction are lost; and therefore they can∣not detain their contents.</P>
<P>When the secretions within become unnaturally pro∣fuse in fevers, the same regard is due to the <HI>spasmodical condition</HI> of the outward vessels, as in the diseases we have more fully spoken of; by keeping the body duly co∣vered, and laying hot bricks near the knees, legs and feet, whilst the proper medicines are given to check those precipitous evacuations. But here, as well as in all other disorders, special regard should be had, to
<PB N="56" REF="010575_0057_0F80D196657E28E8"/>
whatever acrimony may have taken place in the first passages, or passed thence to the blood; whether it were an <HI>acid</HI> alone, or a mixture thereof with the <HI>bile,</HI> which, perhaps, might have brought on the disease, or con∣tinued it afterward. In general, the diaphoretick re∣gimen ought to be used here; and of the cordial brace∣ing kind too, when the patient is much weakened and emptied by a catarrhal spitting, <HI>cholera, bilious</HI> or <HI>serous</HI> purgings or vomitings. But as too bound a belly, is oftentimes the cause of the latter disorder, so it will not cease, till the guts are freed of all hard excrements; for whilst one pellet remains within, their <HI>peristatick mo∣tions</HI> will, as it were, be inverted from the part it lodges in, and of course the vomitings must continue. But maladies of this sort, not being the subject of our pre∣sent enquiry, we shall dismiss all farther considerations of them.</P>
<P>Should any one still doubt, that such <HI>spasmodical</HI> con∣strictions are in truth the cause of fevers, let him but observe what happens to the most weakened persons, when the fatal stages of diseases commence, and it will then clearly appear, how the same effects that arose (though in a smaller degree, because the patients were strong) at the time this <HI>spasm</HI> first attacked, do indeed introduce the scene, that concludes the <HI>tragedy</HI> in all per∣sons who die of any distemper. The certain approach of this mortal period, is announced in many of those who are carried off by acute disorders, by more or less of a <HI>horror</HI> or <HI>rigor.</HI> But, notwithstanding the same hap∣pens sometimes to them who have been worn out slowly by consumptions, purgings, or some other discharges of
<PB N="57" REF="010575_0058_0F80D19724542BC0"/>
long continuance; and in those also who are suddenly exhausted by <HI>choleras, hemorrhages,</HI> or otherwise, it for the most part manifests itself with equal assurance, by a gradual abatement of heat in the hands and feet. And as the vessels there shut themselves up still more, this gains on the limbs in proportion, so that they become cold and sometimes livid, the circulation being then at an end in those parts. And thus the progress of death on the body may be traced; the extreme parts being in∣sensible and inanimated, for many hours, perhaps, be∣fore life is extinguished in the brain and near the heart. On the other hand, the death of those is more sudden, in whom a strong <HI>horror</HI> or <HI>rigor</HI> happened, because of the general and violent contractions of the vessels, which repel the blood tumultuously, and as it were at once, in∣to the internal and superiour parts. And as the vessels within, have not strength to resist so impetuous a torrent of the fluids, as is then made on them; and seeing the spasm is likewise gaining fast on the arteries and other muscular membranes, the brain, lungs and heart are so quickly deluged and overwhelmed, that an end is soon put to the circulation of the blood. In the course of my practice, I have sometimes been present when this <HI>rigor</HI> attacked, and always observed, that according to the degree of it, death ensued sooner or later. Though some become immediately insensible, and cannot move any part from the moment the <HI>horror</HI> came on; others retained both their reason and speech for a short while, and complained either of a painful stiffness as if they were cramped, or a numbness of all the fleshy parts and joints, more especially of the arms, thighs and legs, in so much that they could not move them afterwards. On
<PB N="58" REF="010575_0059_0F80D197E93E3658"/>
the contrary, some cannot lie still at all, but toss them∣selves about in the most restless manner, so long as they are able, from the dreadful stifling, which is caused by the fluids being excessively accumulated in the lungs and large vessels near the heart: Breathing is then very short, redoubled and <HI>suspirious;</HI> and the patient perceives an intolerable heat about the breast, which seems to diffuse itself all over his body, so that he will not endure any covering, and calls out to be fanned, and to have every window set open, be the weather ever so rigorous, though at the same time, he is bathed with clammy sweats, and his legs and arms are cold as marble. The anxious restlessness we just now mentioned, was said to continue so long as the patient could move, or, as would seem, till the vessels of the brain became so distended and full, that they compress the origins of the nerves, and then an end is at once put to all further sensations. The brain being thus effectually surcharged, and the blood still continuing to be propelled that way, the like overfulnesses begin in the vessels of the <HI>cerebellum;</HI> and from that instant of time, breathing, which before was exceeding short, becomes very slow; and the person moves no more, but dies in the posture he lay when that happened. Inspiration is every moment performed at longer intervals now, and ceases as the last act of life, when those vessels are stretched and filled, beyond the power of exerting any farther contractions. Such <HI>rigors</HI> are indeed more common at the end of <HI>acute than chronical diseases;</HI> but I have sometimes seen people re∣cover of fevers, more especially from choleras, though the restlessness and anxiety we spoke of, seemed to indi∣cate that death was near. Yet, whether a distinguish∣able
<PB N="59" REF="010575_0060_0F80D198AF1567E0"/>
<HI>horror</HI> came on or not, no one ever survived this slow breathing, under the circumstances above described; it being a proof, that the organ whence the <HI>vital actions</HI> derive all their energy, is overpowered past a possibility of relief. For before that sort of breathing happened, such an overfulness must have been in the vessels of the brain, that they could receive no more; the whole of the fluids being at those times confined to few vessels.</P>
<P>In proportion to the progress of this fatal spasm on the arteries and other muscular membranes, and the re∣treat of the blood it occasions, from the outward into the internal and superiour parts, How speedily do the signs of death advance? How anxious is breathing, and how fluttering and small the pulse; and when it scarcely can, or, perhaps, cannot at all, be felt in the wrist, what a strong throbbing may be perceived in the <HI>carotids</HI> and about the <HI>epigastrium?</HI> How much are the vessels in the eyes distended (though they do not appear in health), which gives us reason to believe those of the brain are likewise in the same condition; and consequently this is ever a bad sign in acute diseases? Whence proceeds that pale <HI>ghastly countenance,</HI> called a <HI>Hippocratick face;</HI> and why does it portend death to those who are much weakened? And lastly, how it comes that the outward flesh should be hard and rigid at such times, if no un∣natural bracedness took place in the fibres, even of the muscles themselves; general convulsions destroy some; others have only convulsive twitchings all over; some again have been watchful or outrageously delirious; whilst those whose bodies have been drained of the vital fluids by degrees, are oftentimes sensible almost to the
<PB N="60" REF="010575_0061_0F80D19963ADC230"/>
last gasp. However, a peripneumony closes the scene in all who die of any disease.</P>
<P>I shall end this essay with some queries, which, in my opinion, cannot be so well explained in any other way, as by supposing the <HI>spasmodical constrictions we mentioned, to be the immediate cause of fevers,</HI> owing, probably, to some sort of <HI>irritation</HI> affecting the nerves in their courses towards, or after they are inserted in the blood vessels and other muscular membranes. And it is not unlikely, When a person hath been injured by cold or moist air, or a high wind acting on the lungs and outer surface of the body, that they produce the same effects by stimu∣lating too much, as a sharp humour is known to do, whilst it lies in the bowels or passes thence to the blood.</P>
<P>Q. Whether an abatement of the perspiration, be of itself so certain and common a cause of fevers, as is thought, seeing the most dangerous often times attack those suddenly; who were in health but an hour or two before; so that, neither the quantity nor quality of that humour which might then be detained, can, with reason, be accused of such distressing effects in so small a time?</P>
<P>Whether, before a fever can come on, the fluids must necessarily have contracted some sort of acrimony or viscidness, and of course, that the solids were either too much braced or relaxed? I would be understood, that according to the common way of speaking, one or the other of those conditions must have existed, before the <HI>morbifick cause</HI> began to act; or that those of themselves
<PB N="61" REF="010575_0062_0F80D19A75B494B8"/>
were sufficient to produce those effects? but those two questions have been already answered.</P>
<P>Why, in general, the more severe the <HI>horror</HI> and longer its continuance, so much the more dangerous is the suc∣ceeding disease? At first sight one would expect, that the stronger the <HI>rigor,</HI> the more powerful must be the cause that brought it on, and therefore, the greater would be the difficulty to remove the disorder that follows. Yet, though this rule most commonly holds, we have an exception to it in the violent shiverings, which some∣times precede tertian and quartan intermittents, the fits, in either case, often terminating in five or six hours; perhaps, because the solids are lax rather than very springy, and the blood not very compact, before those sorts of fevers can be formed at all; and therefore, the fibres relax sooner after a good warmth is regained; the plentiful sweat which follows putting an end to the fever for that time.</P>
<P>What is the reason why those who commonly have cold feet, are in a particular manner liable to disorders of the <HI>hypogastrium</HI> and parts above? This want of heat must be owing to a lurking <HI>spasm</HI> acting on the vessels there, which prevents the free motion of the blood; so much of it therefore as cannot circulate freely in those parts, must be received by others, over and above what they ought to contain, if a regular distribution of the fluids took place. This surplus will be admitted where∣ever any local weaknesses happen, so that the effects are extremely various. I never knew any person who was habitually liable to such a coldness of the legs and feet,
<PB N="62" REF="010575_0063_0F80D19AE3562480"/>
in whom an acid acrimony did not abound, at least in the first passages, which by its irritation there, or hav∣ing passed thence to the blood, may indeed be the cause of the partial spasm we speak of.</P>
<P>Why are vomitings and purgings so common in fe∣vers during the summer and autumn, and <HI>choleras,</HI> se∣rous or bilious diarrheas also should then be frequent? Because the solids are very lax at those times, and the blood much dissolved. The former therefore are ex∣ceedingly irritable and susceptible of <HI>spasms</HI> from slight causes; and, seeing every unnatural constriction of the outward parts, repels the fluids in some degree, they will now be immediately admitted by the vessels within; in which overfulnesses ensuing, their contents will be as readily allowed to escape, by an increase of some secre∣tion or other. The quantity of returning blood through the <HI>vena portarum</HI> to the liver, being augmented by a <HI>spasm,</HI> a profuse separation of the bile follows; which, passing into the <HI>duodenum,</HI> occasions vomitings, purg∣ings, or both; for the gall is of so pungent and sapona∣ceous a nature, that it will stimulate the stomach and guts strongly to expel itself; and those discharges will continue till the spasm ceases. However, this redun∣dance of the bile is oftentimes prevented, by increased secretions made from other organs, as the stomach, pan∣creas or intestines; and we accordingly find, that the vomitings sometimes are tasteless, and the stools pale and purely <HI>lymphatick</HI> or <HI>serous,</HI> smelling more like fresh blood than excrements.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="010575_0064_0F80D19BAE17B2A8"/>May not the surprisingly profuse discharges of urine, which hysterical and hypochondriacal persons sometimes void, immediately on the attacks of <HI>spasms,</HI> be easily ac∣counted for, from the answer to the preceeding query? And also, how those extraordinary secretions in the kid∣neys may divert greater evils, in the same manner, as if the overfulnesses of the vessels within, were abated by vomitings and purgings, as oftentimes happens, to such subjects; when spasms are brought on by sudden sur∣prizes or frights.</P>
<P>Does it not plainly appear from the foregoing theory, why, when the urine becomes clear in fevers, after have∣ing been thick or high coloured, or it had been limpid from the first, a <HI>delirium, stupor, convulsions, stifling an∣xieties,</HI> or an <HI>obstinaie watchfulness,</HI> may with reason be expected? For such urine shows, that the <HI>spasmodical constrictions</HI> have become more forcible, as well as gene∣ral, or that they were very strong from the beginning, and amongst others reached the emulgent arteries them∣selves. Therefore, as this sort of urine is generally made in small quantities during fevers, the fluids, for those and other reasons, must soon be dangerously collected in the internal and superiour parts, if this cannot be prevented.</P>
<P>How comes it to pass, that either too great a flow or stoppage of the <HI>lochia</HI> and <HI>menses</HI> may happen from a <HI>spasm?</HI> Answer, because of the present local laxness or constriction of the <HI>uterine</HI> and <HI>hypogastrick</HI> vessels, whilst the external ones are at the same time more or less <HI>spas∣modically</HI> affected.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="010575_0065_0F80D19C8539D078"/>Whence is it, that, at the approach of death, some persons have better spirits and are stronger for a little while, the pulse also being then fuller? It probably hap∣pens, from an increased and more general constriction of the arteries, wnich urges the fluids in a fuller stream towards the internal and superiour parts; whereby a momentary greater secretion of the animal spirits is made, as their last effort to maintain life. This is com∣monly called a lightening before death.</P>
<P>May not the painful stiffness that is perceived in the joints and musculous parts, more especially about the thighs and legs, before a fever, be more reasonably explained by supposing a spasmodical constriction of the arteries and other muscular membranes, perhaps of the fleshy fibres of the muscles themselves; the hinderance thence arising to the free motion of the blood, and it may be of the animal spirits also, rather than because the fluids are too viscid to allow a proper secretion of the spirits to be made, as some authors suppose? A plentiful sweat seldom fails to abate those symptoms, and sometimes removes them at once; whereas, they ought indeed to be increased thereby, had they been owing to too thick a consistence in the blood.</P>
<P>Do not the paleness and contraction of the face and all the outward parts, together with every other appearance in time of the <HI>horror,</HI> clearly show that the skin and the several parts having any immediate connexion with it, are then strongly constricted? And does not the small hard pulse make it equally plain, that the coats of the arteries likewise suffer in the same way; and that they
<PB N="65" REF="010575_0066_0F80D19D38D0C4F0"/>
continue thus disordered throughout the disease, so long as the pulse is hard, no matter whether it be small and quick, or strong and slow, as in <HI>comas, apoplexies,</HI> and some other disorders? And seeing so large a vessel as the <HI>carpal artery,</HI> undergoes so forcible a constriction at the first onset of a fever, may not the large trunks and even the muscular fibres of the heart itself, suffer like∣wise in the same manner at times, more especially when diseases draw near their mortal periods? This tightness in the pulse, is imputed by some, to too great a dense∣ness of the blood, which cannot be, for the same happens in some degree during the fevers of infants, <HI>anasarcous</HI> and other much relaxed or weakly people, in whom, surely, the fluids cannot with reason be accused of that fault.</P>
<P>Does not the great thirst that comes on before a <HI>horror</HI> attacks, and continues unquenchable in it, the dry hard crust likewise which presently covers the tongue, the mouth, throat and nostrils also being parched, make it very plain, that the excreting ducts of the <HI>salivary</HI> and <HI>mucous</HI> glands, are then strongly contracted; and the thin parts of those humours exhaling, what remains stopped in the extremities of the ducts thickens, and to∣gether with the <HI>epithelium,</HI> forms the above dry skin? Some authours inform us, that this thick crust arises from a general dissipation of the thin parts of the blood, or I know not what <HI>septick</HI> matter; but neither of those can be impeached for its cause, so early as it oftentimes is seen. And it is also true, that the thicker and drier it is, so much the greater commonly is the danger, that being a sign of general strong <HI>spasms.</HI> But whenever
<PB N="66" REF="010575_0067_0F80D19DEE9B51F8"/>
those <HI>unnatural constrictions</HI> are removed, this will soon disappear.</P>
<P>Are not the <HI>nausea,</HI> the distention and throbbing about the <HI>epigastrium,</HI> the pain in the loins and costiveness so common in fevers, owing to an overcharge in the internal vessels, and a <HI>spasm</HI> that then acts on them, which prevents such an increase of the secretions there, as might abate this fulness, rather than to any acrimony, (though now and then somewhat of that sort takes place in the first passages); a simple dryness of the intestines, which term has no precise meaning; or lastly, to the want of excrementitious matter in them, (though they frequently are much loaded therewith)? The pain in the loins, may in part arise from the <HI>mesenterick nerves</HI> being over-stretched, by the surcharged blood vessels, many of which are closely surrounded by twigs of those nerves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Vieussen: Willis: Winslow: <HI>passim.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Are not the precipitous purgings which sometimes happen towards the end of fevers, most commonly owing to an aggravation of the <HI>spasm</HI> that acted before, where∣by the fluids are still more repelled towards the internal parts. And because the spring of the vessels there was weakened, by the continued overfulnesses they al∣ready suffered, they will now yield the easier to this ad∣ditional weight of the fluids, and permit their contents to escape. Such purgings are commonly imputed to some unknown acrimony or putrefaction of the humours.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="010575_0068_0F80D19E9E22CC48"/>Do not sudden surprizes and frights, act immediately as <HI>spasms?</HI> The coldness, trembling, pale contracted countenance and shrinking of all the outward parts; the palpitations of the heart, anxiety, quick breathing, sobbing, weeping, and small confused frequent pulse; the involuntary passing of the urine and excrements, and rising of the hair on end, plainly prove, that the external surface is strongly constricted, and the fluids impetuously repelled thence by a spasm, or somewhat of this nature, call it what you will.</P>
<P>Whence are clammy sweats, and why do they presage so much danger, when the patient's strength is already spent? And the reason also, why a paleness of the face and shrinking of the features, should at such times, so certainly forebode death? Answer, because those are signs of very general and strong <HI>spasmodick contractions,</HI> not only of the arteries, but of the skin and other mus∣cular membranes likewise, whereby, whatever was con∣tained in the outward excreting canals is pressed out. The nose is now pinched; the lips, ears, temples and face are shriveled, cold and pale; all the outward parts being so forcibly braced, that even the flesh itself feels stiff and hard, as having lost its pliancy.</P>
<P>I may be thought tedious in mentioning those things, but the design was to show, how easily many symptoms which happen in diseases may be explained; and how a tolerable judgment may be formed, either of the pa∣tient's recovery or death, by comparing what hath been said here, together with the second and third chapters of this essay; in which a <HI>spasm</HI> was assigned for the im∣mediate
<PB N="68" REF="010575_0069_0F80D1A14AC654D0"/>
cause of acute distempers; that a very general communication of this constriction must happen, before they can prove mortal to the sick, and also that it must be removed, ere the patient can recover. I have already observed that <HI>Hippocrates</HI> had such a notion of fevers and their symptoms; but, though some moderns rea∣soned well on the effects of such unnatural contractions, yet, in my opinion, they did rot alter the method of cure so much for the better as might have been expect∣ed from their great abilities and long experience.</P>
<P>It hath been said, that when the patient is costive, I loosen the belly at the beginning of almost every fever, and do not suffer it to be long bound afterwards in any one acute disease, provided the nature of the complaint and condition of the sick, will at all permit his having two or three stools daily; experience having convinced me, that the present painful or dangerous symptoms may be mitigated, and others prevented thereby, so proper care be taken in other respects. In short I am bold enough to say, that whoever pursues this method of emptying the abdominal vessels sufficiently, and, in consequence, those of the other internal and superiour parts, in the first days of inflammatory and common continued fevers, under the management above laid down, will remove them sooner, and with less loss of strength to the patients, than by any other treatment hitherto proposed. For, in few words, to recover those who are ill of such disorders, nothing more seems wanting, than to abate whatever overfulnesses may have happened within, from an inverted circulation of the blood, caused by the <HI>spasmodical constrictions,</HI> that seem
<PB N="69" REF="010575_0070_0F80D1A1F9A43DA8"/>
to act chiefly and most strongly on the external vessels; and those contractions must also be removed, else the other end will not be answered.</P>
<P>I frequently mentioned the necessity, for laying hot bricks at a convenient distance from the feet and legs, in fevers; and truly I have found them of so great service, that I think they can scarcely be dispensed with, in very many acute and chronical complaints, more espe∣cially during the winter, unless those parts are inflamed. And I here declare, that they, alone, have given more immediate relief in <HI>hysterical and hypochondriacal spasms,</HI> than could have been reaped from the whole <HI>materia me∣dica of antispasmodicks</HI> without them; the suffocations or convulsions oftentimes abating presently, without the assistance of any thing else <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The justly celebrated <HI>Baron Van Savieten</HI> quotes from <HI>Trillerus,</HI> the case of a young man who had been twice plenti∣fully bled in a <HI>pleurisy,</HI> and with advan∣tage as was thought. But on the fifth day the symptoms were so violent, that the patient's life was in a manner despair∣ed of. His feet being put in warm water, a vein was opened in each, with a large orifice, but no blood issued, so cold were those parts. Scalding water, as would seem, was then poured on them, which made the veins bleed freely, and with so good effect, that the half dead patient was not only relieved, but recovered.— Vide <HI>Van Savieten comment, in Boerhaave</HI> Aph. Tom. III, pag. 39.</P>
<P>This <HI>noble and excellent physician</HI> speak∣ing here of the advantages of bleeding in a <HI>pleurisy,</HI> imputes the recovery of this patient to the quantity of blood that was then taken away; though the two former large bleedings, did not prevent his growing worse. And even here it is most probable, that the lasting good effects ascribed to that operation, were more owing to the hot water, which removed the spasmodick constriction that acted on those parts. This instance is exactly to the point; and clearly shows how neces∣sary it is to keep up a good warmth in the feet and legs in some acute diseases.</P></NOTE>. Putting the legs in warm water, is frequently practised on such and other occasions; but the good effects thereof generally cease with the immersion; for before those parts can be wiped dry, they may be again chilled, and the spasm renewed in consequence. Besides, without great care the pati∣ent's
<PB N="70" REF="010575_0071_0F80D1A266FBA510"/>
linen and bed clothes will be damped by the steams of the hot water; which, as things now are, must have bad effects. It is usual also, to wrap up the legs and feet in hot flannels; but those soon cool and require shifting often. Bottles filled with hot water have like∣wise been tecommended; but I have known them break or leak at the corks in the bed, much to the detriment of the patient; neither does rhe covering lie so close as over the bricks, which may be had almost every where, are soon made ready, and easily changed when they cool. They also are much to be preferred to stones, which are apt to split and fly in the fire; and I have seen this happen even after they were put in the bed.</P>
<P>Thus have I given my opinion on this subject, which if founded in reason, did not need the ornaments of eloquence, to recommend it to the ingenuous. But, if the theory be not rational, or what I reckon upon more, should not the practice stand the test, no flourishes of stile could protect them from that contempt, which whimsical propositions justly deserve, whatever specious arguments introduce them to the publick. Being con∣scious how little I can serve mankind, I ought by all means to be careful how I propagated a doctrine, which, if wrong, might be destructive in the highest degree; more especially as daily opportunities offer for trying it, and, of course, exposing me to censure, were it found fallacious.</P>
<P>The newness of the practice in <HI>pleurisies, peripneumo∣nies,</HI> and some other acute diseases, may cause it to ap∣pear in a suspicious light to those, who do not compre∣hend
<PB N="71" REF="010575_0072_0F80D1A327B18B78"/>
the principles on which it is established; or to those who are not accustomed to reason in the same way on the immediate cause of fevers, and the several symp∣toms that happen in consequence thereof. But what∣ever may be their sentiments on this head, I hope the method proposed above, will neither be condemned by implication nor prejudice, before it hath undergone some fair trials in the way I have directed; when, pro∣vided the medicines operate properly, and due care be otherwise taken, I have no doubts of its succeeding in general, the numberless instances of which, or rather its failing but seldom, unless from mismanagement have emboldened me to say any thing at all of it. I do not however pretend, to the knowledge of any method or remedy, which will remove any one distemper with abso∣lute certainty, being very sensible that the virtues of all medicines are only <HI>conditional</HI> or <HI>relative.</HI> Accordingly we now and then are mortified, by disappointments in the cure of those diseases, which we vainly believed were best understood by us, owing, perhaps, to some∣what of a hidden nature, a certain <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that sets bounds to our presumption: But whether the difficul∣ties arose from my own oversights, some peculiarities either in the constitutions of individuals, or the disorders themselves, which I could not discover, so it was, that I failed in some cases, when I thought myself almost sure of success.</P>

<P>The arteries are naturally so disposed to contraction, from the strength of their <HI>orbicular fibres,</HI> that were it not for the resistance made by our fluids, they would shut themselves up to their axes. A certain quantity of blood must therefore be necessary to keep those vessels duly di∣lated, and excite a proper <HI>diastole;</HI> but when too much of that fluid is lost, and the opposition to their contracti∣bleness is thus lessened, they will close themselves in pro∣portion; and the more, because the force of the heart is weakened both by this great loss of blood and the dis∣ease. We have a plain proof of this, from the fainting that happens when the vessels have been suddenly emptied by
<PB N="73" REF="010575_0074_0F80D1A4A1A0CF78"/>
a large orifice; for the quantity of returning blood to the heart being now so diminished, that enough thereof does not arrive at that organ, to promote a proper <HI>diastole</HI> that a forcible <HI>systole</HI> may follow. In this case, the feet and hands become cold, and the countenance pale and con∣tracted; all the outward parts shrink; and clammy sweats appear as the arteries collapse, for want of a suitable quantity and due <HI>impulse</HI> in the blood, to keep them fully distended; so that the skin, together with its contiguous vessels and membranes, plainly undergoes <HI>spasmodical con∣strictions</HI> at such times.</P>
<P>On some occasions, we are directed to take away blood <HI>ad animi deliquium;</HI> but to say the least, this is a very un∣certain rule, for supposing bleeding to be necessary, some persons may faint before a sufficient quantity hath been lost, and others may bleed too much, ere they fall into a <HI>syncope.</HI> But when a fainting happens, the vein ought to be bound up immediately, however small the dis∣charge might be, and the patient laid down, if he had been bled sitting up.</P>
<P>Repeated bleeding is also enjoined in some cases, till the blood appears florid and free of all <HI>siziness;</HI> but whatever show of reason may be in this, the injunction seems not much better founded, than the common ex∣pression <HI>of taking away all the bad blood, and leaving only what is good behind.</HI> For it may be truly asserted, that this point will not be attained, so the fever continues, before the vessels have been too much emptied, and the vital actions depressed in proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="010575_0075_0F80D1A56111F910" MS="y"/>The weakness brought on by an excessive loss of blood, is sudden and great, and its effects may be traced for a long time, by a paleness of the face, trembling, chilli∣ness, and want of heat in the extreme parts, great lan∣guidness of the vital and natural actions, and a slow re∣covery. On the whole, though the loss of some blood may be, occasionally, needful, or taking away a moderate quantity may do little harm in some cases, the abuse of that operation is certainly very hurtful for the present, as well as the time to come. Eight or ten ounces of blood, are as much as any man ought to lose in most disorders; for if farther evacuation be necessary, he that understands the foregoing theory, cannot be at a loss as to the way it should be made; the method above proposed having this great advantage, that though a patient may be much more emptied thereby than by bleeding, this, however, is done by degrees, and his strength is all the while sup∣ported with proper nourishment. The judicious <HI>Sydenham,</HI> seriously laments the necessity he thought there was, for bleeding so often in the rheumatism, because of the great weakness it brought on. He therefore changed <HI>that</HI> practice, and, after the third bleeding, depended on purging and anodynes, which answered equally as to the disease, far better surely for the patient; and the effects would have been as good after bleeding only once, or, perhaps, not at all, as much experience hath convinced me; more especially had he added <HI>sudorificks</HI> and <HI>alkalies</HI> to his other medicines.</P>
<P><HI>Vomits</HI> are thought by many, to be, as it were, in∣dispensibly needful, more especially in remitting and in∣termitting fevers; but, as might be expected, those
<PB N="75" REF="010575_0076_0F80D1A64F0903A8"/>
who make this a rule, oftentimes do much mischief; which is not charged as it ought to be, to their own te∣merity and want of judgment. All the bad effects of this headlong sort of practice, cannot be recounted here; but let us give a very common instance, in the cases of those who are stupid and drowsy in fevers, from too great a fulness in the vessels of the brain, the belly being at the same time bound.—Now, though the fevers may abate, according to the usual courses of those dis∣eases, yet a hard and too quick pulse, head-ach, sickness at the stomach, and general disorder, frequently remain, as evidences, not only of a lurking <HI>spasm,</HI> but likewise of too great an overcharge still remaining, in the in∣ternal and superiour vessels. To give an emetick, there∣fore, under circumstances like these, can scarcely fail in having pernicious effects; even <HI>convulsions,</HI> a <HI>dilirium</HI> or <HI>stupor</HI> sometimes ensuing immediately, or at the next re∣turn or increase of the fever. How those things should be, is so evident as not to need any explanation: Never∣theless when a patient discharges much <HI>mucus, acidity, green or yellow bile,</HI> in the fever, we ought to promote the vomitings with warm water drank plentifully, and thrown up again, till it returns clear and tasteless. <HI>Car∣duus or camomile tea</HI> is often used for this purpose, from a notion that they strengthen the stomach; but they lie so little a while there, that any effect they may have this way, does not deserve our regard at such times; besides, the bitterness of those infusions conceals other tastes, so that we cannot so well know when all the offending mat∣ter is discharged, as if water alone were used.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ESSAY II.</HI> Of the Crises of Common Continued, and Inflamma∣tory Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>IT will plainly appear from the foregoing <HI>Essay,</HI> how ill qualified the authour is for <HI>medical disputation,</HI> more especially, when the design was to oppose some notions, that have been long admitted for truths. But if there be reason to suspect, that certain opinions have been adopted, which were liable to objection, it can have no bad consequences to examine them, seeing those things will still remain as before, if they be not dis∣proved.</P>
<P>Various are the ways in which <HI>crises</HI> are said to be brought about; but however the symptoms might be moderated in fevers by a hemorrhage, or an increase of some excretion or other, I never saw an acute disease go clearly off, before a general sweat happened. This sort of perspiration, sometimes, is of so rank a nature, as to be offensive to the sick themselves, and their attendants
<PB N="78" REF="010575_0078_0F80D1AA059492D8"/>
also, owing, perhaps, to the great heat and rapid mo∣tion the fluids sustained, whereby their saline and sul∣phureous parts were not only multiplied, but rendered more volatile also; the urine and stools, likewise, ac∣quiring a more nauseous scent from the same causes.</P>
<P>When this sweat is coming on, the pulse becomes fuller and more soft, and the tongue moister, as signs of some abatement in the <HI>spasmodick</HI> condition of the solids, and that the hindrance to a more regular distribution of the fluids, is now giving way. And, as the perspira∣tion advances more, the pulse still softens, fills and be∣comes slower; whatever overfulnesses happened in the internal and superiour parts, together with the several symptoms which depended thereon, abating also by de∣grees. For as the outward vessels relax yet more, and continue to discharge themselves plentifully, those with∣in, being eased of their overload, by the humours now taking another course, recover their <HI>systole,</HI> and by little and little clear themselves of the surcharges they suffer∣ed; so that, provided things be but well managed now, a free circulation will soon ensue; or, in other words, the disease will cease, all the unnatural constrictions being then abated.</P>
<P>Before the pulse becomes softer and more full, it will be vain to look for the <HI>sedimentum album leve &amp; aequale,</HI> so much wished for in the urine during an acute disease; because the <HI>morbifick matter</HI> is thought to be discharged that way. But this sort of sediment, among others, is only a sign, that the vessels within are recovering their natural diameters, whether they had been too much di∣lated
<PB N="79" REF="010575_0079_0F80D1AA9F5BB1D8"/>
or contracted before; for more or less of such a settling, will always be seen in the urine of people in health: And why it should be more plentiful at the end of fevers, may be understood from the greater laxness of the solids, and dissolution of the fluids, of which both the full soft pulse and <HI>critical sweat</HI> are proofs. Be∣sides, from the vehemence of the circulation during a fever, more particles may be rubbed off the coats of the vessels than in health, and help to increase this sedi∣ment. Here I would be understood to mean, what hap∣pens at the termination of acute diseases; for though the blood be ever so <HI>sizy,</HI> when the compressing force of the vessels was exerted with its greatest power, yet, if the patient be bled some hours after the fever ceased, the <HI>serum</HI> will then be more in quantity than it was during the distemper, and the red part less. Indeed, the paleness and weakness which are seen after every fever, plainly enough show, that the solids are much relaxed and the blood thinned.</P>
<P>It must not be inferred from those loose hints, that I consider the inspection of the urine as unnecessary; on the contrary, I do not know any one of the internal secre∣tions, whence so good a judgment may be formed, of the condition of the parts within during fevers, as from <HI>that discharge.</HI> The urine is clear in acute diseases with <HI>convulsions, stupors,</HI> or <HI>delirium,</HI> more especially if the latter be of the outrageous sort; in <HI>manias, apoplexies, epilepsies,</HI> during the <HI>horrors</HI> of all fevers, as well as in <HI>hysterical, hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>asthmatick</HI> attacks, particu∣larly when the belly is bound, in consequence of a <HI>spa∣smodick constriction</HI> of the <HI>muscular fibres</HI> of the intestines,
<PB N="80" REF="010575_0080_0F80D1ABD5C33E48"/>
which prevents the secretions being made in them. But, when purgings happen in fevers, the urine is, commonly, thick or high coloured, and hath either a large sediment or cloud; for the urinary organs, then partake of the same laxness with the other internal parts.</P>
<P>Limpid urine, is justly esteemed an unfavourable sign in fevers, for it shews a very extensive strong spasm. But the mischief this portends, ought not to be imputed to the detention of any <HI>morbifick matter</HI> that should have passed that way, seeing the disease continued whilst the urine was very thick, but to the spasm having com∣municated itself to a greater number of vessels, and be∣coming stronger also, on those it possessed before, whereby the fluids are repelled into fewer vessels and a smaller compass. In this case, the most alarming conse∣quences are to be dreaded, from the overfulnesses and stagnations that must soon ensue in the internal and su∣periour parts. And we accordingly see, that either a <HI>dilirium, convulsions, comatous</HI> or <HI>lethargick stupors, mortal anxieties,</HI> &amp;c. infallibly succeed when such a change hap∣pens in the urine, unless they can be prevented; but this is seldom in our power, when patients, are much weakened.</P>
<P>Symptoms like those we have just now mentioned▪ are said to happen <HI>per metastasm,</HI> or from a translation of the <HI>morbifick matter</HI> to the brain or elsewhere. But that sort of reasoning explains nothing to me, who have some doubts of such matter existing in the fluids, more especially at the beginning of common continued, in∣flammatory or even intermitting fevers, when such
<PB N="81" REF="010575_0081_0F80D1AC21794278"/>
symptoms are frequently seen. However, I can easily comprehend how they may be brought on, by an aggra∣vation of the spasm; which, as it must take place before a fever can attack, so must it be removed ere the patient will recover, or become very general before a disease can prove mortal, as already hath been said.</P>
<P>When the urine is clear in fevers, it is commonly secret∣ed in small quantities; but hysterical and some other people, whose nerves are very sensible, oftentimes discharge aprofusion of urine, immediately after the attack of a <HI>spasm;</HI> which, past all doubts, prevents ill consequences in another way, that else would ensue, when the fluids are thus precipitously and impetuously repelled towards the viscera and brain. Again, it for the most part holds, that when the belly is loose in fevers, more espe∣cially during warm weather, the urine will be high co∣loured, or full of sediment; and so long as it continues so, there is not much danger either of <HI>stupors or convul∣sions,</HI> unless the patients sit up too long when they are very weak. At the time therefore, that the urine is clear in the first days of fevers, it is a rule with me to re∣move the stricture of the vessels within, and abate what∣ever overfulnesses have happened there, by promoting loose stools and sweatings likewise, in order to obviate the danger that would quickly follow, from the fluids being accumulated in the internal and superiour vessels. This, indeed, cannot be done, when the patient's strength is already spent by a lingering disease; but it may and ought to be attempted, at the beginning of common continued and inflammatory fevers, which oftentimes prove mortal on the third, fifth, or seventh day; for in
<PB N="82" REF="010575_0082_0F80D1ACE1A2CF30"/>
such cases, enough of fluids generally remain to the last breath to support life, were the vessels but in condition to circulate them. They therefore who fall by disorders of that sort, truly die a violent death, as we have al∣ready said. On the whole, though the examination of the urine be useful, as thence both the approach and completing of the <HI>crisis</HI> may be pretty well known, yet in my opinion, it cannot be affirmed with any degree of propriety, that the body is so commonly freed of the <HI>febrifick cause</HI> that way as is thought, if it be at all, un∣less the distemper arose from gravel in the passages; but we do not speak of such complaints.</P>
<P>A <HI>crisis</HI> is said to be brought about, by bleedings from the nose, <HI>uterus</HI> and <HI>hemorrhoidal veins;</HI> and like∣wise by a <HI>diarrhea,</HI> an <HI>expectoration,</HI> &amp;c. It cannot in∣deed be denied, that a well-timed suitable discharge made in either of those ways, will much abate the painful symptoms, by venting some part of the fluids, that were too much collected in the vessels within, and more so in some than others, which being thus eased of their over-fulnesses, will now contract themselves with greater power. And because the same effects extend to others, in some degree, and also to the heart and lungs, the blood must then he propelled with a greater <HI>impetus</HI> to∣wards the constricted vessels, and so dilate them gradu∣ally. Yet after all, the sweat we mentioned must still ensue, before a complete <HI>crisis</HI> can happen, no matter by whatever natural or artificial discharges, the overload, which took place in the vessels within, might be lessen∣ed. Does not what we have said of the humours being too much repelled from the outward to the internal parts
<PB N="83" REF="010575_0083_0F80D1ADF3EBFA18"/>
at such times, plainly appear among other things, from what happens to the strongest man at the first onset of an inflammatory fever? for the pulse is then so small, the patient likewise being in all respects so exceedingly weak and helpless, because the vital actions are as it were overpowered, that they who know not the reason, be∣lieve no blood ought to be taken away; but after that hath been done, the sick person perceives himself stronger, and the pulse also inlarges.</P>
<P>Fevers are said to cease, when the <HI>morbifick cause</HI> hap∣pen to be thrown on the glandulous or other parts; but, though it be easy to conceive how obstructions of this sort may be formed, yet in what manner they prove truly <HI>critical,</HI> those must declare to whom such instances have occurred. For myself, I always observed that some degree of feverishness still remained, till those tu∣mours were either discussed or suppurated; and even then the patient sweated at last before he recovered.</P>
<P>As to a <HI>critical diarrhea,</HI> it is just what we proposed to bring on early in the disease; and if the patient hath the good fortune to sweat, when that happens of its own own accord, the same salutary effects may probably en∣sue, as we find by promoting those discharges at the be∣ginning, in order to relieve the vessels within of the sur∣charges they sustained, and perhaps clearing the first pas∣sages of some sort of acrimony, that might either bring on or continue the spasm. But, whether this purging come on naturally, or was promoted by art, a general sweat must nevertheless follow, before the patient will be free of fever.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="010575_0084_0F80D1AE5DEE5698"/>Whether fevers can be removed in cold climates, without the sweat we mean, I will not dispute; but in <HI>South-Carolina</HI> they never have a crisis any other way; and how it can be otherwise elsewhere, does not appear from the laws of mutual action between the solids and fluids, or according to the foregoing theory. The dis∣charge may not, indeed, be so plentiful in cold countries as with us, in whom a laxer constitution commonly pre∣vails, for the greatest part of the year.</P>
<P>My opinion of those things is confirmed, by what authours have said of the different sorts of <HI>crises;</HI> for such increased excretions could not have been made, unless the fluids were either too much collected in, or too plentifully determined towards the places whence they proceed. For it is plain, that had they circulated freely and equally throughout the system as in health, nothing of that nature could have happened, because the secretions would not have exceeded any where, every part then receiving only its proper quantity of the fluids. Much less could a hemorrhage break out, except the vessels had first been so over-stretched, that their coats were made to give way to the additional weight and <HI>impulse</HI> of the blood. Neither could this have been, if the progress of the fluids had not been intercepted, in some degree, by some change made in the condition of the arteries in other parts. It then seems clear, that so much of the blood as could neither be received nor circulated by the vessels, which were <HI>spasmodically affected,</HI> must have been admitted by others, over and above what they ought to contain, had a re∣gular distribution of it taken place, as we have already
<PB N="85" REF="010575_0085_0F80D1B28CBB71F8"/>
mentioned. An expectoration could no more happen in a <HI>peripneumony</HI> than from a <HI>diarrhea,</HI> unless the fluids had first been unnaturally accumulated in the lungs, to augment the secretions there; and the extravasat∣ed humours acting as a stimulus, they excite a cough to expel themselves. Have we not evident proofs of too great distention in the vessels, at or near the place, whence a future <HI>hemorrhage</HI> or an augmented secretion is to proceed, for some time before this happens? Is not a bleeding from the nose, preceeded by a fulness and flushing of the face, throbbing of the <HI>carotid</HI> and <HI>tem∣poral arteries,</HI> buzzing or ringing in the ears, and a heaviness or pain in the eyes and forehead? How dif∣ficult is breathing, and what heat and oppression are perceived about the breast in <HI>peripneumonies,</HI> and in the <HI>peripneumonick stages of pleurisies,</HI> owing to the great weight of fluids, with which the lungs are charged? In the mortal stages of all diseases, how anxiously do the patients toss themselves about, and gasp in the quickest manner, because of the stifling from the fluids being mostly accumulated in the lungs and large vessels near the heart; the circulation being already at an end in the extreme parts? May it not be foretold that the menses will soon flow, when a heat, throbbing, heavi∣ness and pain are perceived about the loins, hips and <HI>hypogastrium?</HI> And, not to mention other things of the same sort, when the circulation begins to recover itself in the external small arteries, the <HI>critical sweat</HI> may be announced, by a more equal heat, a plumpness of all the outward parts, and softness of the skin, together with a fuller and less hard pulse, a moister tongue, and an abatement of the sickness, anxiety, &amp;c. all plain
<PB N="86" REF="010575_0086_0F80D1B323CF53F0"/>
proofs of what hath been repeatedly alledged, of a <HI>spasmodick constriction</HI> being the immediate cause of fevers, which the several symptoms we have last recounted, show is then giving way,</P>
