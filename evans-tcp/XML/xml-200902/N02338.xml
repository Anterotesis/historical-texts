<HEAD>MANUDUCTIO AD MINISTERIUM, OR, The ANGELS <HI>preparing to Sound</HI> the TRUMPETS.</HEAD>
<P>§. 1. INtending to give you some DIRECTI∣ONS for your Proceeding in the STU∣DIES, upon which you are Entring, that you may be prepared and furnish∣ed for the Work of the Evangelical MINISTRY, to which you are designed; I shall not consult the Method which any of the twice Twelve, <HI>Dissertationes de Studiis,</HI> (Collected by <HI>Elzivir</HI> in one little Volum.) have given you. But the Contemplation of DEATH shall be the FIRST Point of the <HI>Wisdom</HI> that my Advice must lead
<PB N="2" REF="002772_0014_0FE62E6681977C68"/>you to. In the FIRST Place, <HI>My Son,</HI> I advise you to consider yourself as a <HI>Dying Person,</HI> and one that must <HI>shortly put off this Earthly Tabernacle.</HI> I move you, I press you, To <HI>Remember how short your Time is,</HI> yea, though it should reach to the <HI>longest</HI> that is ordinarily known among the Chil∣dren of Men; and how much more <HI>short</HI> it may be made for ought you know, in the <HI>Early Anti∣cipations</HI> of Mortality. Do this, that you may do nothing like <HI>Living in Vain.</HI> Place yourself in the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of a <HI>Dying Person;</HI> your <HI>Breath</HI> failing, your <HI>Throat</HI> rattling, your <HI>Eyes</HI> with a dim Cloud, and your <HI>Hands</HI> with a damp Sweat upon them, and your Weeping Friends no longer able to retain you with them: And <HI>then</HI> enter∣tain such Sentiments of <HI>this World,</HI> and of the <HI>Work</HI> to be done in this World, that such a <HI>View</HI> must needs inspire you withal. Such a <HI>Numbring of your Days,</HI> I hope, will compel you to <HI>Apply your Heart unto Wisdom;</HI> and Instruct and Excite you to spend your little TIME in such Things, and so Industriously, as may be a Matter of <HI>Comforta∣ble Reflection</HI> at the End of your Days. The <HI>Ap∣prehension:</HI> of a <HI>Dying Person</HI> are usually so Wise, and so much have the <HI>Right Thoughts of the Righte∣ous</HI> in them, that the best Counsel which can be given you, is, <HI>Child, Make haste into them!</HI> It can∣not be <HI>too soon</HI> to come into them. They will have a mighty Tendency to make you Serious, Discreet, and Industrious, and every way well∣advised; and <HI>all that your best Friends would have you to be.</HI> You run the hazard of <HI>Dying without Wis∣dom,</HI> if you delay to come into them; and <HI>pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> far away</HI> that which by doing so you will make
<PB N="3" REF="002772_0014_0FE62E6681977C68"/>an <HI>Evil Day.</HI> It was not a Folly in some of the Ancients, to assign the <HI>Contemplation of Death,</HI> as the main Foundation, and main Exercise of their <HI>Philosophy;</HI> And the <HI>Young Man</HI> will arrive to <HI>more Understanding than the Ancients;</HI> who does practice upon it. I propose a, <HI>Vive memor Mortis,</HI> as what will be the <HI>Way</HI> to the truest <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and no little <HI>Part</HI> of it; and as what will contribute as much as possible for any thing to do, unto a <HI>Wise Conduct</HI> in all your Affairs. May the THOUGHTS OF A DYING MAN come into an <HI>Early</HI> and <HI>Lively</HI> Consideration with you, and regulate your Intentions, your Appetites, your Behaviours. My Proposal is, That you would set apart <HI>proper Times,</HI> [And be sure, The <HI>Present Time!</HI>] to think, <HI>What sort of Life shall I most approve when I come to Dye! In what Work shall I most wish to have lived, when I see that I am to Dye? What Method and Man∣ner of Living shall I apprehend the most Eligible, when my Dying Hour is come upon me?</HI> Behold, What will <HI>give to the Young Man Knowledge and Discretion!</HI></P>
<P>§ 2. The Apprehension of <HI>Approaching DEATH,</HI> One would think, should make you assoon as may be <HI>Begin to Live.</HI> But you do not <HI>Begin to Live,</HI> no, you are <HI>Dead while you Live,</HI> until you <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI> Methinks, I have already pre∣pared you to consider the Words which before I go any further, I shall transcribe for you, from a Treatise Entituled, <HI>The Angel of Bethesda,</HI> which is yet, [I may say, <HI>lying at the Pool,</HI>] un∣published. <Q>CHRISTIAN, Fill thy Life with most explicit <HI>Acknowledgements</HI> of the Glorious GOD, and Acts of <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him. Let even
<PB N="4" REF="002772_0015_0FE62E6687866C10"/>the whole Business of thy <HI>Temporal Calling</HI> be ex∣plicitly designed for an <HI>Obedience</HI> to GOD. At the same time, Fill thy Life with <HI>Good Offices</HI> to Mankind, and with <HI>Actions</HI> that shall be <HI>Blessings</HI> (and make the <HI>Doer</HI> a Rich One) unto thy Neighbours. This will be <HI>Living. — Caetera Mortis erunt.</HI> The Man who does the most of these things is the <HI>longest Liver.</HI> In <HI>Three Sevens</HI> of Years, One who lives at this rate may have a <HI>longer Life</HI> than a Drowsy and Thoughtless Wretch, that should get along to <HI>Nine Hundred and Sixty Nine.</HI> I may make the more free with the Number in my Expression on this Occasion, because the <HI>Jewish Rabbi</HI>'s venture to tell us, That the Time lost by <HI>Methusalah</HI> in Imperti∣nent Things, being defalked from his <HI>Nine Hun∣dred and Sixty Nine</HI> Years, he will have no more than <HI>Ten Years</HI> of <HI>True Life</HI> lest unto him. It is a Maxim of Truth, <HI>Non Annu sed Factis vivunt mortales.</HI> And, <HI>They have lived longest in the World, who have done the most Good in the World.</HI></Q> So my <HI>Angel.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>My Son,</HI> though I began with Re∣commending to you the <HI>Thoughts of a Death at Hand;</HI> yet, what I mean, is, to make a <HI>long Live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and in Order to it, a <HI>True Liver,</HI> of you.</P>
<P>The true <HI>END of Life</HI> must therefore assoon as may be, come to be stated and fixed with you, and the <HI>false Ways</HI> of Sin be no longer walked in. And what can this END be, but, The SERVICE OF THE GLORIOUS GOD? Or, as you have been taught from your Infancy, TO GLO∣RIFY GOD AND ENJOY HIM FOREVER. When you have considered the Matter with the
<PB N="5" REF="002772_0015_0FE62E6687866C10"/><HI>deepest Meditation,</HI> you can settle no where but <HI>here,</HI> and you can see nothing worthy to be the END of Living, but <HI>This. May my Life be such a continual Homage to the Glorious GOD, as He may, thro' His CHRIST look down with Delight upon.</HI> If you <HI>Terminate</HI> in any <HI>Inferiour End,</HI> and rise no Higher in your <HI>Aims,</HI> than to have your SELF accommodated with such Things as a <HI>Carnal Mind</HI> calls, <HI>comfortable Circumstances.</HI> Your <HI>Life,</HI> what is it but a <HI>perpetual Folly,</HI> on which you may cry out, <HI>O me nunquam sapientem!</HI> All your <HI>At∣chievements,</HI> though they should be never so <HI>pomp∣ous,</HI> are but <HI>empty Futilities.</HI> Nay, How little Higher do you <HI>Aim,</HI> than the <HI>Beasts that Perish?</HI> And how much will you deserve the Name of <HI>Brutish,</HI> which is the Denomination with which your <HI>Herd</HI> is branded in the Oracles of GOD? A little more Hair, and crawling upon all Four. — and, what the Difference! But, O <HI>Star</HI> fallen and choaked in the <HI>Dust, Arise and shine, and let thy Light come, and the Glory of the Lord be risen upon thee!</HI> It is brought about, and <HI>the True Light shines,</HI> when you come to make Choice of This, as the <HI>main Scope</HI> of your <HI>Living</HI> in the World; <HI>It shall be that the Glorious GOD may be gra∣tified, in beholding through His CHRIST the Homage which I pay unto Him; rendering and procuring Ac∣knowledgements to Him in all my Ways!</HI> And wise∣ly subordinate all your <HI>Actions,</HI> and all your <HI>En∣joyments</HI> unto it: <HI>Govern</HI> your <HI>Actions</HI> by it, and consider them, as <HI>Parts</HI> of that <HI>Homage; Relish</HI> your <HI>Enjoyments</HI> from it, and consider them as <HI>Helps</HI> for that <HI>Homage;</HI> and often have your <HI>Ex∣plicit Thoughts</HI> upon it. Come into those <HI>Right
<PB N="6" REF="002772_0016_0FE62E7157F489B0"/>Thoughts of the Righteous,</HI> with which the Ancients were illuminated, when they determined that, <HI>Uti Deo et frui Creaturis,</HI> does in short and at once express all the <HI>Disorder</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> that Mankind is thrown into. Having such a <HI>single Eye,</HI> your whole Conduct will be <HI>full of Light.</HI> But if you have none but some <HI>Inferiour End,</HI> in your <HI>Eye,</HI> you will have an <HI>Evil Eye;</HI> Your very <HI>Light</HI> will be <HI>Darkness;</HI> and how <HI>great your Darkness!</HI> From that Hour that you come into this <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> and thus <HI>dwell in GOD,</HI> it is inexpressible how Comfortably you will <HI>Walk with GOD,</HI> and have the Blessed GOD ever <HI>dwelling</HI> in you. The GOD who <HI>forms the Spirit of Man within him,</HI> has imprinted on your <HI>Spirit, a Tendency of Return unto Him.</HI> This <HI>Impression</HI> is wretchedly Suppressed, and Sinned away, in your Fall from GOD, and the <HI>Tendency</HI> wofully diverted and enfeebled. The Faculty, which we call, <HI>The Conscience,</HI> is the <HI>Tes∣timony</HI> of this <HI>Impression,</HI> and is, <HI>The Work of the Law written in the Heart.</HI> If it must continue un∣der its <HI>Depravations</HI> and <HI>Encumbrances,</HI> what re∣mains of it, will be only to inflict the Eternal Scourges, and Scorches of a <HI>Self condemning Mind</HI> upon you. Such a <HI>Recovery</HI> of it, as will restore the MOST HIGH, unto His <HI>Throne</HI> in your Soul, so that nothing shall be <HI>Above</HI> HIM there, nor shall there be any <HI>Denial</HI> of the GOD <HI>that is Above,</HI> but the INTENTION of a grateful HOMAGE unto the Glorious GOD, shall command your whole <HI>Conduct;</HI> THIS is the <HI>Highest Felicity</HI> that you can aspire unto. The very <HI>Top</HI> of what our Great REDEEMER has proposed for us, is; An UNION with GOD!</P>

Many things there are that pass for <HI>Wisdom</HI> among the <HI>Children of this World.</HI> But THIS is the GRAND POINT, whereof it may be assert∣ed, <HI>Here is WISDOM; Let him that hath Understand∣ing pass a Judgment upon it.</HI> The Syrname of old put upon our <HI>Gildas,</HI> belongs unto the <HI>Children</HI> of this <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and unto none but those. Until this Point be gained, nothing that is truly <HI>Wise,</HI> is to expected from you. But let your Accom∣plishments be what they will, you stand in the List of those, that must have it said of them, <HI>What Wisdom is there in them?</HI> Nay, since the <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> which a Man makes his <HI>last End,</HI> the same he makes his GOD, so many <HI>low</HI> and <HI>base,</HI> and <HI>wrong Ends,</HI> as those wherein you terminate, un∣til you thus <HI>live unto GOD,</HI> are your <HI>Gods;</HI> your <HI>Life</HI> is a course of Detestable and Abominable <HI>Idol∣atrics;</HI> your Portion will be among the <HI>Idolaters,</HI> who shall <HI>not inherit the Kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>It is with the utmost Importunity, that I press to have this Matter well settled with you. Yea, <HI>Entreat me not to leave you, nor to return from follow∣ing after you,</HI> until you are brought into this <HI>Way of Living,</HI> which distinguishes the <HI>Excellent of the Earth,</HI> from those who are but so many <HI>Carcases</HI> falling in the <HI>Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P>That you may not fall into the Hypocrisy of many Books, which wear the <HI>Motto</HI> of, <HI>Soli Deo Gloria,</HI> upon them, while the Author in reality never aim'd any higher than his own ad∣mired <HI>self,</HI> but as a truly learned Writer detects him, <HI>Scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itat sibi ipsi, ac Famae suae, interdum et Fami;</HI> Let me labour a little more to explain this most <HI>Rational Mystery of Godliness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002772_0017_0FE62E715D470E60"/>
GOD is <HI>Glorified,</HI> when His Infinite <HI>Perfection;</HI> are Beheld and Confess'd, with a suitable <HI>Venera∣tion;</HI> and His Glorious CHRIST is considered with the <HI>Regards</HI> which GOD has required for Him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Service</HI> of GOD lies in this <HI>Veneration;</HI> and in the <HI>Doing</HI> and <HI>Using</HI> of those things, that shall be <HI>Subservient</HI> unto it.</P>
<P>Hence, Whatever contributes unto the <HI>Welfare</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> and such a <HI>Relief</HI> of their Miseries, as may give the Children of Men better <HI>Opportu∣nities</HI> to <HI>Glorify</HI> Him, <HI>This</HI> also is to <HI>Glorify</HI> Him.</P>
<P>In <HI>Glorifying</HI> of GOD, there must be a, <HI>Legiti∣ma scoporum Subordinatio;</HI> and you are perpetually to <HI>discern,</HI> and to <HI>design,</HI> the <HI>Subordination.</HI></P>
<P>But see what Provision I shall make for you. I purpose anon to lead you into an Acquaintance with various <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Arts;</HI> but I can do no∣thing until you are acquainted first of all, with what I may call, much more justly than that which has been commonly called, <HI>The Universal Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, I will here lay before you, <HI>A Plan of Real and Regular Living,</HI> exhibited in an IN∣STRUMENT, in which One whose <HI>Purpose and Manner of Life</HI> has been <HI>known</HI> unto you, stated his <HI>Method of living unto GOD.</HI> It will be no <HI>Vanity</HI> to say, That if the <HI>Instrument</HI> could be shown in as many <HI>Languages,</HI> as <HI>Grotius,</HI> his, <HI>De Veritate,</HI> has ap∣peared in, or as many as paid their Obsequies unto <HI>Peireskius,</HI> yea, or as many as they say are spoken in the City of <HI>Cairo,</HI> it could meet with no <HI>consi∣derate Reader,</HI> that would not find something with∣in him, that would compel him to <HI>Justify</HI> it.</P>

Here you have, what may challenge the Title of, <HI>Jmre Binah,</HI> with you.</P>
<P><HI>Sic Vivitur.</HI></P>
<Q><P>With a <HI>single Eye,</HI> to keep up a Regular and Perpetual <HI>Aim</HI> at the RIGHT END, of all that I <HI>do,</HI> and of all that I <HI>have;</HI> This will be to <HI>walk in the Light</HI> continually. The GLORY of GOD is the only RIGHT END of all; and it will gloriously <HI>Lighten</HI> the Mind that has an <HI>Eye</HI> upon it. But the <HI>Lamb</HI> is to be at the same time, the <HI>Light</HI> of such a Soul, and a CHRIST is to be considered: GOD in that <HI>Lord of Glory,</HI> is to be the Object which my <HI>Eye</HI> must be for ever to, if I would not have my <HI>Foot in the Net</HI> of the <HI>Evil Ones.</HI></P>
<P>That I may truly <HI>Live,</HI> Oh! may the <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> and of His CHRIST, be thus <HI>manifested in me!</HI></P>
<P>Every thing which the <HI>Candle of the Lord</HI> con∣demns as an <HI>Evil Thing,;</HI> I would forever <HI>Abhor</HI> it, and <HI>Avoid</HI> it; Because it will incur that Re∣buke, <HI>By Sin thou dishonourest GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I apprehend every <HI>Act of Obedience</HI> to GOD, as a Thing which the Eye of that Infinite One does with Pleasure take Notice of.</P>
<P>That which procures any Act of <HI>my Obedience</HI> to be pleasing unto the Infinite GOD, is the <HI>Mediation</HI> of my SAVIOUR. HE has by <HI>His Obedience</HI> to GOD for me, made <HI>Expiation</HI> for the Defects of <HI>my Obedience,</HI> and bespoke a gracious Acceptance for it. This <HI>Obedience</HI> of <HI>His,</HI> I look upon, and lean upon, as the only <HI>Righteousness</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002772_0018_0FE62E82AB7C56E8"/>that <HI>Justifies</HI> me. But <HI>mine</HI> has in it a faint <HI>Re∣semblance</HI> of that perfect <HI>Obedience</HI> which my JESUS has yielded unto GOD for me; And it is an <HI>Obedience,</HI> which the SPIRIT of my JESUS, influencing and actuating of me, is the Worker of. Yea, 'Tis more immediately to a Glorious CHRIST, and GOD shining upon me in <HI>Him,</HI> that I may pay my <HI>Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>If I may in any Act of <HI>Obedience,</HI> or of <HI>Sub∣mission,</HI> to the Will of GOD, be a <HI>Grateful Spec∣tacle</HI> to HIM, or, if HE may take <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in what He helps me to <HI>Be,</HI> and to <HI>Do,</HI> before Him, This is the <HI>Highest Felicity</HI> I can wish for; the <HI>Top</HI> of my Ambition; the last END, the main and chief <HI>Scope,</HI> of my Life. <HI>Lord,</HI> Beyond This, there is nothing that I can <HI>Ask</HI> or <HI>Think.</HI></P>
<P>Prepared with such Sentiments, I proceed now thus to fix my Eye upon the RIGHT END of all that <HI>my Hand finds to do,</HI> or that GOD puts into it.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I attend on the DAILY SACRIFICES of the Closet and of the Houshold?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire now to pay that <HI>Homage</HI> to thee, which Thou wilt, for the sake of Thy CHRIST, look down with Delight upon.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I give Attendance on the PUBLIC EX∣ERCISES of Religion?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire to join with thy People, in paying to Thee those <HI>Acknowledgements,</HI> which thou art well-pleased withal.</P>
<P>I would also improve in <HI>Knowledge</HI> and in <HI>Goodness,</HI> and so in being what GOD would have
<PB N="11" REF="002772_0018_0FE62E82AB7C56E8"/>me to be, by conversing with such <HI>Truths</HI> as I now meet withal.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I set my self to READ THE SACRED SCRIPTURES?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire to pay a due Regard unto the <HI>Treasures</HI> with which thou graciously enter∣tainest me. Yea, I would <HI>hear,</HI> what GOD the Lord will <HI>speak</HI> unto me; and be taught what I may <HI>speak,</HI> and how <HI>live</HI> unto Him.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I, in the Way of my STUDIES, go to fill the Chambers of my Soul with all precious and plea∣sant Riches?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire to furnish my self with such Things, as may render me more <HI>Qualified</HI> for what <HI>Service</HI> thou mayst call me to.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I compose the DISCOURSES, which I Exhibit, either in the Press or in the Pulpit?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire to communicate unto others, what may <HI>Animate</HI> them, or <HI>Accomplish</HI> them, for <HI>Living unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Why do I make any of my VISITS to any of my Neighbours? Or, Countenance their Visits unto me?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire to let fall something in the <HI>Couference,</HI> that may be for the good of the <HI>Com∣pany;</HI> even, that more may be <HI>Known</HI> of thee, and <HI>Done</HI> for thee, from what passes in it.</P>
<P>And, When I propose to <HI>Ingratiate</HI> my self unto any People, by the Civilities of Conversa∣tion, it shall be, that I may gain thereby the better <HI>Advantages</HI> to prosecute <HI>Good Purposes</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>In Conversation, I would especially lay hold on all Advantages to introduce as much as I can of a lovely CHRIST into the View of all that I come near unto.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002772_0019_0FE62E82AFF47188"/>
My JOURNEYS must like my <HI>Visits,</HI> be for nothing, but that GOD may be served in them.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I EAT or DRINK?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire nothing but that I may be <HI>Strengthened</HI> for the <HI>Work,</HI> which thou hast as∣signed unto me.</P>
<P>What of the <HI>Table,</HI> may for Quality or Quan∣tity, indispose me for Thy <HI>Work,</HI> I will for <HI>that Cause</HI> avoid it.</P>
<P>And I will affect most, what I find most use∣ful to me for the <HI>Work</HI> before me. LORD, I would have my <HI>Appetites</HI> entirely Regulated from <HI>this</HI> Consideration.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I allow SLEEP to my Eyes, or SLUM∣BER to my Eyelids?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire to have my Spirits recruited for that <HI>Work,</HI> wherein, <HI>I delight to do thy Will, O my GOD.</HI></P>
<P>In using of REMEDIES for the Relief of any <HI>Maladies,</HI> I am to be acted from the same Con∣sideration; That what hinders me from com∣fortably proceeding in the <HI>Work of GOD,</HI> may be removed.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I TRIM, CLEANSE, ADORN my Body?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire to Recommend my self un∣to them, unto whom I would be <HI>Acceptable</HI> in my Endeavours to convey something of <HI>Thee</HI> unto them.</P>
<P><HI>Why do I suffer my self to be perswaded into any brief DIVERSIONS?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire, that by a little unbending of my <HI>Bowe,</HI> and Remitting the Intenseness of my <HI>Essays to do Good,</HI> I may the more harden it
<PB N="13" REF="002772_0019_0FE62E82AFF47188"/>into a <HI>Bowe of Steel;</HI> and Return with more Vi∣gour to the <HI>Work</HI> of my GOD.</P>
<P>But, I will <HI>Watch</HI> for all Opporunities, to car∣ry on <HI>Essays to do Good,</HI> in the midst of my <HI>Di∣versions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Why do I write any LETTERS?</HI></P>
<P>LORD, I desire now to <HI>do something</HI> that that thou wouldest have to be done. Here is a Business that GOD calls me to.</P>
<P>And, if I can interweave any mention of any Matters in and for which, I may bespeak <HI>Thee</HI> to be Adored, it shall be mentioned.</P>
<P>I will add this Article to this Point of my living unto GOD. The several <HI>Petitions</HI> which I carry to the Glorious GOD in my <HI>Supplications,</HI> I would very distinctly examine, <HI>What Aspect they have upon the Service of GOD?</HI> If I can see <HI>none,</HI> I will drop them and lay them aside. But the View of an <HI>Holy Aspect</HI> in them, and if the <HI>Voice of my Supplications</HI> truly be, <HI>Let GOD be glorified,</HI> that shall invigorate them.</P>
<P>But, Finally; <HI>What is it that gives me a RE∣LISH for the COMFORTABLE THINGS that are bestowed upon me?</HI> What are the Things which <HI>Delight my Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the <HI>Comforts</HI> which abate the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of my Pilgrimage?</P>
<P>LORD, <HI>Thou</HI> shalt be the <HI>Joy of my Joy.</HI></P>
<P>None of these Things are to be my <HI>Enjoyments;</HI> They are to be but <HI>Instruments.</HI></P>
<P>There are SENSUAL OBLECTATIONS, which I may lawfully <HI>Taste,</HI> but always <HI>Thankful∣ly,</HI> in Compliance with the <HI>Order,</HI> wherein the <HI>GOD of Nature</HI> has made them agreeable to the <HI>Senses.</HI> His <HI>Bounty</HI> is to be <HI>tasted</HI> in them; and
<PB N="14" REF="002772_0020_0FE62E84F45C5BA0"/>as being the Effects of <HI>That,</HI> they are to be <HI>De∣lectable.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sweet</HI> of my BODILY NOURISH∣MENTS, must lye, not in their being so much suited unto my <HI>Palate,</HI> as in the <HI>Support</HI> they bring me for the <HI>Service</HI> of my GOD.</P>
<P>This also is that which makes the REST <HI>of the labouring Man sweet unto him.</HI></P>
<P>How far are my POSSESSIONS, of <HI>Lands,</HI> or <HI>Goods,</HI> or <HI>Money,</HI> to be <HI>sweet</HI> unto me? No far∣ther than as they are <HI>Helps</HI> to me, in the <HI>Work of GOD.</HI> And they are never to be used by me, but when something that I may count a <HI>Work of GOD,</HI> is to be carried on. All my <HI>Expenses</HI> are to be, on <HI>something that GOD would have to be done:</HI> And so to <HI>spend,</HI> should be as pleasant unto me, as it can be, to <HI>Gain</HI> or <HI>Save.</HI></P>
<P>When I am a MARRIED MAN, I am doing my <HI>Duty to GOD,</HI> in conforming to the <HI>Ninth</HI> of <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> and the <HI>Ninth.</HI></P>
<P>My CHILDREN are Valuable, and very <HI>Re∣lishable</HI> Things. My <HI>Reason</HI> is; <HI>They are the Sub∣jects of thy Kingdom, O my GOD and SAVIOUR:</HI> And THOU hast made me <HI>Related</HI> unto Them, and they are by THEE <HI>committed</HI> unto me, as precious Things, in singular Circumstances, to be thro' my Cultivation and Erudition and In∣struction, more than any others, rendred such Servants unto Thee, as Thou mayst <HI>account for a Generation.</HI></P>
<P>My FRIENDS are some of my <HI>Good Things.</HI> That which makes them so, is the <HI>Good</HI> I may do <HI>to</HI> them, or I may do <HI>by</HI> them. And further, <HI>I would not know them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002772_0020_0FE62E84F45C5BA0"/>
LORD, The Things which DISCOVER THEE to me, shall <HI>therefore</HI> and <HI>so sar,</HI> be <HI>sweet;</HI> and the <HI>more Discovery</HI> they make of Thee, the <HI>sweeter</HI> they shall be, unto me.</P>
<P>What and where my <HI>Relish</HI> for BOOKS, which I may be hungry for? LORD, Because I shall <HI>see</HI> THEE, or <HI>serve</HI> THEE, the more for the Reading of them.</P>
<P>I do not meerly once for all, settle upon these RIGHT ENDS, for the <HI>Center of my Life,</HI> and the <HI>Consecration of my All</HI> unto my GOD and SAVIOUR, but I would <HI>often, often,</HI> even as of∣ten as I can, <HI>explicitly consider</HI> them. And if any Thing occur, wherein I cannot see these RIGHT ENDS answered, I would be loth to meddle with it.</P></Q>
<P>As an Epilogue unto this Instrument, I would subject the weighty Words, which a dear Brother of mine, a Professor in the <HI>Frederician</HI> University, who understands this <HI>Way of Living,</HI> has upon it. <HI>Omnia ita facienda sunt, respectu habito ad GLORI∣AM DEI; ut, etsi non semper Actus adsit hujus Inten∣tionis, omnia tamen fiant ex</HI> habitu <HI>et</HI> generali propo∣sito <HI>nunquam mutando. Sed tamen</HI> actualis Intentio, <HI>et crebra ejus</HI> Repetitio, <HI>plurimum prodest. Conscien∣ciam enim conservat tranquillam, animum{que} ob since∣ram Intentionem bene sibi conscium, reddit Laetum, et in Opere ipso Alacriorem ac circumspectiorem.</HI></P>
<P>§. 3. But you will not come to <HI>This,</HI> until the Glorious <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> give you a <HI>New Heart,</HI> and cause a <HI>Regenerating Work</HI> of His Grace to pass upon you, and by Sanctifying Impressions of
<PB N="16" REF="002772_0021_0FE62E852BA1D0A8"/>His Holy SPIRIT upon you, <HI>call you to His Glory by CHRIST JESUS.</HI> A <HI>Carnal Mind</HI> in you, full of <HI>Enmity</HI> against GOD, will have a perpetual <HI>Aversl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> for this <HI>Living to Him,</HI> till He shall by His Verticordious Influences, Heal the Distempers which you have contracted in and by your De∣parture from Him. Your <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD, must be accomplished, or else you will have no <HI>Heart,</HI> nor <HI>Skill,</HI> nor <HI>Strength,</HI> for that Life of PI∣ETY, which must be laid in the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all the Good, that is to be expected by you, or from you. Now that you may arrive to all the Bles∣sedness of a <HI>Sinner converted from the Error of his Way,</HI> and a <HI>Soul saved from Death,</HI> I will briefly de∣scribe to you that <HI>Process of Repentance</HI> which you must go thorough, and which every Man that <HI>lives,</HI> and <HI>knows</HI> that he shall, but not <HI>when</HI> he shall, <HI>see Death,</HI> is out of his Wits, if he do not immediately come into. For this Purpose, I need not alter the Direction that my <HI>Caelestinus</HI> has already given you; You have in <HI>unalterable Strains</HI> had the <HI>Sum of the Matter.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Take a <HI>proper season</HI> for it, and, <HI>My Son,</HI> the <HI>present season;</HI> I say, <HI>Immediately!</HI> Therein, First, <HI>Humbly</HI> and indeed, <HI>Lying in the Dust,</HI> own your self <HI>unable</HI> to do any thing effectually of your self in <HI>changing</HI> of your Heart, and bringing your Soul to be <HI>informed</HI> and <HI>affected</HI> as it ought to be. Say, <HI>O Glorious GOD, I justly perish, if I do not come unto thee; But if thou draw me not, I shall never come unto thee.</HI> Yea, and therewithal, Humbly own, That if ever GOD <HI>changes</HI> your Heart, and enable you to do any Good Thing, there must be Triumphs of <HI>Sovereign Grace</HI> over
<PB N="17" REF="002772_0021_0FE62E852BA1D0A8"/>the Basest and Blackest <HI>Unworthiness</HI> in it. Say, <HI>Lord, I am utterly Unworthy that thou, who alone hast the Words of Eternal Life, shouldest ever speak them unto me, and cause me to Live.</HI></P>
<P>Under such an <HI>Humiliation,</HI> go on, and lay be∣fore your self a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of Things <HI>Forbidden,</HI> and Things <HI>Required,</HI> in the <HI>Ten Commandments.</HI> Loath and Judge your self before the Lord, for the <HI>Innumerable Evils,</HI> which beholding your self in this <HI>Glass,</HI> you will see <HI>Encompassing</HI> of you. Let your Contempt of the Gospel, and your Neg∣lect of the JESUS, who would save you from these <HI>Innumerable Evils,</HI> be thrown as a yet more heavy Weight into the Scale. But then, Go back as far as your <HI>Original Sin,</HI> the Sin of the first hearkening to the <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> and the <HI>Venom</HI> derived from thence, which is the <HI>Original</HI> of all your <HI>Actual Sins;</HI> The <HI>Corrupt Fountain,</HI> which has run into the Streams of the Actual Enormi∣ties and Iniquities, with which your Life has been polluted. Own upon it; <HI>O Great GOD, Thou art Holy and Righteous in all the sad Things that have ever been inflicted on me, and hast punished me less than my Sins deserve. I deserve to be stript of all that may be at all Comfortable to me; I deserve to be scourged with sore Plagues and of long Continu∣ance; I deserve to be thrown into the Place of Dra∣gons, and be punished with the Devil and his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Behold the SON of GOD <HI>made Flesh</HI> in the Blessed JESUS, and profering to do the Part of a <HI>Mediator</HI> for you; yea, making Him∣self Responsible for the <HI>Debt</HI> of His People to the <HI>Law</HI> of their GOD. Behold Him undergo∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="002772_0022_0FE62E901EC08F00"/>the Punishment which was due to you for your Sin, and with Bloody Sufferings making a Sufficient <HI>Expiation</HI> that you may not be <HI>punished</HI> for it. Behold Him <HI>fulfilling all Righteousness,</HI> in <HI>doing alwaye the Things that please the Father;</HI> that so you may have a Lot among the <HI>Righteous.</HI> Admire the <HI>Free Grace</HI> of the Glorious GOD, which allows you to make this Plea, for your <HI>Justification. Plead</HI> it, that you may be <HI>Justified.</HI> Plead it, with a <HI>Comfortable Perswasion</HI> of your finding a <HI>Kind Reception</HI> with your SAVIOUR; Don't think, that you <HI>Honour,</HI> but that you <HI>Re∣proach</HI> your SAVIOUR, if you doubt your <HI>Kind Reception</HI> with Him.</P>
<P>At the same time, take up a <HI>full Purpose of Heart,</HI> that you will <HI>cleave unto the Lord.</HI> Let your <HI>Heart be fixed</HI> in a strong <HI>Purpose</HI> to <HI>deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts,</HI> and lead a <HI>Godly,</HI> and a <HI>Sober,</HI> and a <HI>Righteous</HI> Life. But Resign your self up unto your SAVIOUR, that HE may by His Holy SPIRIT <HI>make you perfect in e∣very good Work to do His Will, and work in you that which is well pleasing in the sight of GOD.</HI> Wholly Despair of doing any thing that is <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and Just and Good,</HI> any further than you have your SAVIOUR <HI>Strengthening</HI> of you.</P>
<P>Thus you have done, what you have to do, that you may <HI>lay hold on Eternal Life.</HI> If GOD be with you in this Action, your <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD is now accomplished.

<P>§. 4. Certainly, you will be brought now with∣out much Difficulty, to what I next proceed un∣to! Being thus brought into an <HI>Happy State</HI> of <HI>Reconciliation</HI> to GOD, you are <HI>prepared,</HI> yea, you cannot but be <HI>disposed,</HI> now to hearken unto such <HI>Subordinate Counsels</HI> as I am now to offer you: Whereof the First will be, That ESSAYS TO DO GOOD, may fill your Life, and be the very <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Business</HI> of it, and the principal <HI>Delight.</HI> The <HI>Motto</HI> which an English Lord has upon his Coat of Arms, is what I propose to your conti∣nual Ambition; UT PROSIM. And, <HI>My Son,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="002772_0023_0FE62E902379C980"/>My Advice to you, is, Begin betimes to take that Noble QUESTION into |Consideration, <HI>What Good may I be capable of doing in the World?</HI> Have stated and proper <HI>Times</HI> for it, and these as often as may be, to consider on the QUESTION; and keep a <HI>Record</HI> of your <HI>Purposes.</HI> First with an humble and mournful Sense of your own <HI>Barren∣ness,</HI> and sensible how much you want that <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which is to <HI>find out well-advised Inventions,</HI> Look up to GOD your SAVIOUR, that by Him (who is the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of GOD) <HI>living</HI> in you, and <HI>leading</HI> of you, you may obtain a fair View of the <HI>Op∣portunities to do Good,</HI> which He has put into your Hand, that they may not be <HI>a Price in the Hand of a Fool;</HI> and a clear View of the <HI>Methods</HI> to be ta∣ken that this Good may be prosecuted, and your <HI>Desire sweetly accomplished.</HI> Then proceed and Enquire.</P>
<P>Enquire; First, <HI>What shall I do for MY SELF, that I may MY SELF Improve in Knowledge and Goodness; and the Ends of those Means, which the Divine Cultivation employs upon me?</HI></P>
<P>Enquire, next; <HI>What shall I do for my several RELATIVES, my Kindred according to the Flesh; That I may prove a Blessing in each of my Relations?</HI> Take a Catalogue of them; and successively be∣stow <HI>distinct Thoughts</HI> upon them all.</P>
<P>Then go on to take some Cognisance of the several SOCIETIES to which you stand related; Especially the <HI>Church</HI> whereof you are a <HI>Member,</HI> [and the <HI>College,</HI> if you belong to <HI>That!</HI>] Yea, the <HI>Town,</HI> and the <HI>Land,</HI> whereof you are an Inhabitant.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002772_0024_0FE62E9281135460"/>
Think, <HI>What Good is to be proposed and promoted here!</HI> To what an Extent, <HI>O dear Son, and pleasant Child,</HI> may thy <HI>Projections</HI> carry thee!</P>
<P><HI>Particular Persons</HI> in your Neighbourhood may now also, be found out, as <HI>Objects</HI> that <HI>Good</HI> may be done unto; The <HI>Poor</HI> for to be relieved; The <HI>Sick</HI> for to be visited; The <HI>Sad</HI> for to be com∣forted; and those that are <HI>out of the Way,</HI> to be reclaimed from the <HI>Error of their Way.</HI> Many of those whom you have distinguished in thus doing of <HI>Good</HI> unto them, you will find prove <HI>Monsters of Ingratitude.</HI> But let not this dishearten you. GOD is now trying of you, <HI>Whether you will do Good for the pure sake of Good;</HI> And you will this way have <HI>Recompences</HI> ascertained unto you, in the <HI>Harvest,</HI> when, <HI>Whatsoever Good Thing any Man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But, because your own <HI>Capacities</HI> to <HI>Do Good</HI> may be greatly limited, you should also have a Time to think; <HI>What Good lying out of my Reach may I see others capable of doing more than I?</HI> And hereupon become an Humble Adviser unto them. Yea, I could wish, You would betimes make it a Rule for your Conduct; That you will as far as you can, always endeavour a <HI>Profitable Conver∣sation;</HI> and in every Company, think, whether you may not with Decency let fall some Word, which they may be the <HI>Wiser</HI> or the <HI>Better</HI> for; and every one go from you, <HI>Aut Doctior, aut Me∣lior,</HI> for you.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Opportunities to do Good,</HI> may at first be ve∣ry <HI>small,</HI> and under very narrow Limitations. Nevertheless I press you to <HI>begin Betimes,</HI> your
<PB N="23" REF="002772_0024_0FE62E9281135460"/><HI>Enquiries</HI> after them, and your <HI>Actions</HI> upon them; and expect, that tho' the <HI>Beginning</HI> be but <HI>small</HI> the <HI>latter End</HI> shall <HI>greatly increase.</HI> That Word, <HI>Habenti dabitur,</HI> will be Remarkably and Conspi∣cuously fulfilled unto you, by the all-governing <HI>Providence</HI> of Him, who has all <HI>Opportunities to do Good,</HI> entirely at His Disposal. Your <HI>Circles</HI> will grow wider and wider; and anon expand unto Dimensions beyond what you could at first have imagined. And, I hope, you will esteem your <HI>Opportunities,</HI> as your Incomparable <HI>Treasures.</HI> While others are hunting and grasping after the sordid <HI>Wealth</HI> of this World, which will presently be found all <HI>Vanity, Vanity!</HI> You will reckon your Advantages to promote the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Welfare</HI> of Men, as much more valuable <HI>Riches.</HI> You will be as Thankful to any One, who informs you of a Point wherein you may <HI>Do some Good,</HI> as if he had presented you with a Wedge of <HI>Gold:</HI> And your Maxim will be, <HI>Divi∣tiis abundet per me lieet, qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>squis voluerit; In Operi∣bus mea sit Abundantia.</HI></P>
<P>But then, you must n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be so weak as to ima∣gine, that this <HI>Way of Living</HI> will recommend you to the Favour of <HI>This World.</HI> A sedulous <HI>Doer of Good</HI> will certainly find himself more exposed than other Men, to be <HI>Ill-spoken</HI> of; greatly Ma∣ligned, Reviled, Slandered. Here, <HI>Patience</HI> must <HI>have its perfect Work.</HI> I may say, <HI>Here is the Patience of the Saints.</HI> Yea, I must say, <HI>Be very Courage∣ous.</HI></P>
<P>I will conclude this Matter with the Words of One who knew what he Wrote. <Q>Were a Man
<PB N="24" REF="002772_0025_0FE62E92870D5410"/>able to write in <HI>seven Languages:</HI> Could he con∣verse daily with the sweets of all the <HI>Liberal Sciences,</HI> that Polite Men ordinarily pretend unto; Did he entertain himself with all the Ancient and Mo∣dern Histories: And could he feast continually on the <HI>Curiosities,</HI> which all sorts of Learning may bring unto him; None of all this will afford the Ravishing Satisfaction; much less would any grosser Delights of the <HI>Senses</HI> do it: which he might find in relieving the Distresses of a poor, mean, miserable <HI>Neighbour;</HI> and which he might much more find in doing any <HI>Extensive Service</HI> for the Kingdom of our Great SAVIOUR in the World, or any Thing to redress the Miseries under which Mankind is generally Languishing.</Q></P>
<P>§ 5. You are now in the Pursuit of that <HI>Learn∣ing,</HI> and those <HI>Ingenuous</HI> and <HI>Mollifying Arts,</HI> which which may distinguish you from the more <HI>Un∣cultivated</HI> Part of Mankind, and may accomplish you to claim a Place among them, who are the <HI>Blessings</HI> and <HI>Beauties</HI> of their Generation. Con∣cerning <HI>This,</HI> what I do in the <HI>First</HI> Place Advise you to, is, To fix the END of all your <HI>Studies,</HI> and let <HI>This</HI> be what it ought to be. Let <HI>Vives</HI>'s Motto, <HI>Oculus ad Scopum,</HI> have its Influence upon you in your whole Course of all your <HI>Studies.</HI> If you Aim no Higher nor Better, than to render yourself <HI>Considerable,</HI> and make a Figure among your Fellow-Mortals, or, perhaps, to gain a <HI>com∣fortable Subsistence</HI> in the World, <HI>All</HI> you do is <HI>Wrong</HI> and <HI>Mean,</HI> and <HI>Vile,</HI> and the Holy GOD looks down with Abhorrence upon you. A <HI>Ber∣nard</HI> is not the only Christian, who has had a
<PB N="25" REF="002772_0025_0FE62E92870D5410"/>true <HI>Sight</HI> of the <HI>Vanity,</HI> with which the Studies of the most that seek after Knowledge, are carried on, and pronounced those the only <HI>Right Students, Qui ad hoc volunt Intelligere ut Benefaciant.</HI> I hope it would not be unintelligible unto you, if I should recommend unto your Emulation, a Flight of One, who tho' I find him in the <HI>Cursed</HI> City, herein spoke like <HI>One of ours; Lord, I had rather, could it be without Sin, that all should hate me, than that they should Love me for myself: If all the World hate me, I should have but what is mine; if they should Love me for myself, they would usurp what is Thine.</HI> But thus much I cannot but wish for; That you may <HI>betimes</HI> be inspired with Senti∣ments, by which the <HI>Idol</HI> that has more Votaries than that on the Plain of <HI>Dura,</HI> that is to say, SELF, may be dethroned with you. Be aware of it, that the most of People who shall Honour you, and Admire you, and Applaud you, will Termi∣nate in <HI>you,</HI> and look no further than the <HI>Worm</HI> they look next upon: GOD will not have <HI>His Praises</HI> in what is done for you, and by you. GOD, without whom, and Before whom, you are as <HI>nothing,</HI> will not be <HI>Remembred;</HI> And all will be <HI>as nothing,</HI> in <HI>Remembrances</HI> of none but <HI>Ashes.</HI> A <HI>Sacrilegious Idolatry</HI> will be committed! But a true Servant of GOD, will even deprecate it, as an <HI>Infelicity,</HI> to be made the Object of this <HI>Idolatry:</HI> And wish, <HI>Lord, Let those that Fear thee,</HI> [and will see Thee thro' me,] <HI>be those that shall turn unto me.</HI> The <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, must make you chuse rather to be left <HI>unregarded</HI> in the World, than to have those <HI>Regards</HI> paid unto you, wherein the Infinite GOD, the <HI>First</HI> and the <HI>Last,</HI> shall be
<PB N="26" REF="002772_0026_0FE62E9FA2304608"/>Robb'd of <HI>His Glory,</HI> which He will not <HI>give unto another.</HI> Yea, Be prepared for <HI>Obscurities,</HI> and for <HI>Indignities,</HI> and be Reconciled unto them upon this Account, <HI>I am now delivered from any Danger that the Robbers of GOD may make an Idol of me!</HI> But having thus forbidden you the <HI>Wrong</HI> ones, I will tell you, what is the RIGHT END unto which it were to be wished, that your Studies may be Consecrated.</P>
<P>When you are upon seeking an Acquaintance with any <HI>Languages;</HI> Let your <HI>Aims</HI> be these. <HI>I Desire to come at those Treasures, which these Tongues may be Keys unto; And this, that so I may be the bet∣ter furnished for that SERVICE OF GOD, which I may be called unto.</HI></P>
<P>When you are upon seeking an Acquaintance with any <HI>Sciences,</HI> Let your <HI>Aims</HI> be these; <HI>I De∣sire to gain those Illuminations which may be necessary for an Instrument of Good unto others; And this, that so I may be the better Qualified for that SERVICE OF GOD, which will require a Workman that need not be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>When you are upon <HI>Reading</HI> any <HI>Book,</HI> Let your <HI>Aims,</HI> for ever be of the same Importance.</P>
<P>To Strengthen my Advice, I will transcribe some Words of the Celebrated Lord Chief Jus∣tice <HI>Hale;</HI> who in his <HI>Account of the Good Steward,</HI> says, <Q>I carried along with me, in all my Studies, this <HI>Great Design,</HI> of improving them, and the Knowledge acquired by them, to the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD's Name, and the greater Discovery of His <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> and so transla∣ted my <HI>Secular Learning</HI> into an Improvement
<PB N="27" REF="002772_0026_0FE62E9FA2304608"/>of <HI>Divine Knowledge.</HI> And had I not practised this Design in my Acquists of <HI>Humane Learning,</HI> I had concluded my <HI>Time mispent;</HI> because I ever thought it unworthy of a Man that had an <HI>Everlasting Soul,</HI> to furnish it only with such <HI>Learning,</HI> as would either <HI>Dye with his Body,</HI> and so become un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seful for his Everlasting State, or that in the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Moment after Death</HI> would be attained with∣out Labour or Toll in this Life.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus fixed the RIGHT END of your Studies, Let the View of it make such an Impres∣sion upon you, as to produce a Marvellous <HI>Indus∣try</HI> in your Prosecution of it: And Quicken you to observe that Maxim, <HI>Do with thy Might, what thy Hand finds to do.</HI> Remember this; There ne∣ver was an <HI>Eminent,</HI> who was not an <HI>Industrious</HI> Man. You must be <HI>Diligent in your Business,</HI> if you would hope to <HI>stand</HI> in any Desireable Cir∣cumstances <HI>before</HI> that Great KING, unto whose Holy Service you are Dedicated.</P>
<P>That you may not suffer a Vile <HI>Impediment in your Studies,</HI> and <HI>Avocation</HI> from them, I do now particularly warn you against the senseless Folly of an Entanglement in any <HI>foolish Amour,</HI> while you are yet a Student at the College. 'Tis time enough, to think of <HI>Marriage,</HI> when your Con∣dition in other Circumstances as well as that of <HI>Age,</HI> will qualify you to make a <HI>Wise Choice,</HI> in a Point, which a very great <HI>Felicity,</HI> or a very great <HI>Calamity,</HI> for the rest of your Days, will turn upon.</P>
<P>§. 6. The <HI>Regulation of your Studies,</HI> is what I would now proceed unto. And for this, though
<PB N="28" REF="002772_0027_0FE62E9FA8D51448"/>the <HI>Regulae Studiorum,</HI> Written by <HI>Chytraeus,</HI> be a Book which I can heartily commend unto your Perusal, yet, it being Written an Hundred and Twenty Years ago, I shall not think the Per∣usal of <HI>That</HI> sufficient for a Student in <HI>our</HI> Days. I must further Accommodate you. And here, <HI>Humanity</HI> would complain of me, if I should for∣bear to tell you, That the LATIN Tongue, which is more known and used than any upon Earth, except the <HI>Arabic,</HI> is what you should for many Reasons labour to be Ready at; and Able not only to <HI>Write,</HI> but also to <HI>Speak</HI> in it, with <HI>Fluency</HI> as well as <HI>Purity;</HI> and confute the com∣mon Observation, that tho' <HI>Englishmen</HI> do often <HI>Write</HI> [call <HI>Spencer</HI> and <HI>Burnet,</HI> for <HI>Two Witnesses,</HI>] the best <HI>Latin</HI> in the World, yet they often <HI>Speak</HI> it but indifferently. For this Purpose you will do well frequently, both to employ your Pen, for composing <HI>Discourses</HI> or <HI>Epistles</HI> in it; and like∣wise to maintain frequent <HI>Conferences</HI> in it, with such as understand the <HI>Phrases</HI> and <HI>Beauties</HI> of it. Indeed, I know not a prettier Way, than this; Translate into <HI>English</HI> the Paragraphs of some Au∣thor who writes very good <HI>Latin</HI> [say, the <HI>Enchi∣ridion Precum</HI> of a <HI>Boehm;</HI>] and then again, Laying aside your Author, turn your own <HI>English</HI> into <HI>La∣tin;</HI> and so compare <HI>That</HI> with, and correct it from, your Authors. But at the same time, you should familiarize yourself with the <HI>Style</HI> of some Authors, whose <HI>Latin</HI> cannot but ever Charm you with its Elegancies. On this Occasion, I am as far from inviting you into the Gust of <HI>Linacre,</HI> as great a Critic as most we have had for the <HI>Latin Tongue,</HI> who, <HI>Ciceronis dictionem, nunquam probare po∣tuit,
<PB N="29" REF="002772_0027_0FE62E9FA8D51448"/>nec sine fastidio audire;</HI> As I am, from invit∣ing you into the <HI>Ciceronian</HI> Bigotry of a <HI>Bembo,</HI> or, to be as afraid as <HI>Longolius</HI> was of using the Word, <HI>Possibile.</HI> But yet I will presume upon so much of <HI>Paradox,</HI> as to offer you my Opinion, (tho' I know what Censure a <HI>Quintilian</HI> would pass upon me, for saying) That the <HI>Latin</HI> of an <HI>Erasmus,</HI> of a <HI>Calvin,</HI> or of a <HI>Witsius,</HI> is preferrible unto <HI>Ci∣cero</HI>'s; yea, to make up the Mess, I am content that poor <HI>Castellio</HI> too be introduced.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rome</HI> you must needs pass to <HI>Greece.</HI> And I cannot but wish you so much a GRECIAN, as not only to understand your <HI>Greek Testament,</HI> better than they do ordinarily at this Day in <HI>Athens,</HI> in which, of all Places, it seems they now speak the <HI>worst Greek</HI> that is any where spoken; but also, that you may at least be able to Read a <HI>Chrysostom</HI> of the <HI>Savilian</HI> Edition; and not enjoy the <HI>Fathers</HI> only in the <HI>Latin Translations,</HI> in which alone, the Roman Catholicks, (agreeably indeed unto the <HI>Name</HI> of their <HI>Church,</HI>) now generally chuse to publish them and peruse them. However, I can't encourage you, to throw away much Time, up∣on an Accurate Skill in the <HI>Greek Accents:</HI> But rather wholly to drop them, when your Quill comes to convey any <HI>Greek</HI> into your Pages. For, as the Writing of <HI>Greek</HI> otherwise than in <HI>Capitals,</HI> was introduced in later Ages by the Monks of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who borrowed the smaller Letters now used from the <HI>Copric;</HI> So, One shall hardly find any <HI>Accents</HI> on the <HI>Greek,</HI> in any Manuscripts written above Eight Ages ago: Nor was the Invention of the <HI>Accents,</HI> with which our <HI>Greek</HI> is now en∣cumbred,
<PB N="30" REF="002772_0028_0FE62EA0AFD6E320"/>of any other than a <HI>Musical</HI> Intention. And, <HI>Vossius,</HI> with <HI>Henninius</HI> after him, are not the only Gentlemen, who have declared earnestly a∣gainst pronouncing the <HI>Greek</HI> according to the <HI>Accents:</HI> I pray, how would a Verse of <HI>Homer</HI> sound, if it were so pronounced?</P>
<P>But for the HEBREW, I am importunate with you. And the more so, because 'tis one Remark∣able Instance of the <HI>Depraved Gust,</HI> into which we are of later Years degenerated, that the Know∣ledge of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is fallen under so much Dis∣repute, as to make a learned Man almost afraid of owning that he has any thing of it, lest it should bring him under the Suspicion of being an Odd, Starv'd, Lank sort of a thing, who had lived only on <HI>Hebrew Roots</HI> all his Days. What would an <HI>Amama,</HI> and the rest of the brave Men, who shone in the former Age, and had <HI>Souls like the Gates of a Temple,</HI> say, if they might Rise and see the <HI>Men of this Generation!</HI> 'Tis true, the Know∣ledge of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is, contrary to the old Max∣im, <HI>Difficilia quae Pulchra,</HI> with very little <HI>Difficul∣ty</HI> attain'd unto. Even our little Damsels, like <HI>Blaesilla,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Paula,</HI> (concerning the <HI>Mother</HI> of whom <HI>Jerom</HI> reports the same, that he does of the <HI>Daughter,</HI>) make nothing of coming at this Uncommon Ornament. And <HI>Cooper</HI> says, truly, that if Students would spend as much Time at it in a Morning or an Evening as they mispend on an unprofitable Pipe of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> they would in a few Days be Masters of it. It is also to be owned, that there appears nothing more impertinent, than a little <HI>Hebrician,</HI> Vapouring and Swaggering, as
<PB N="31" REF="002772_0028_0FE62EA0AFD6E320"/>if he had all the Learning in the World; and laying hold on all Occasions to throw out an <HI>He∣brew</HI> Clause or Word, for nothing but the Osten∣tation of his <HI>mighty Accomplishment.</HI> Nevertheless, the Knowledge of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> is to be valued and pursued, on this Design; 'Twill enable you to penetrate further into the <HI>deep Things</HI> which the <HI>Spirit of GOD</HI> has laid up in His Oracles, than you could possibly do, by seeing them only in some Translation. Tho' with much more Cause than the modest <HI>Melancthon,</HI> I may confess <HI>Me vix primis Labiis degustasse Hebraicas Literas,</HI> yet as <HI>he</HI> declared, what <HI>Hebrew</HI> he had helped him so much in his Judgment of the greatest Matters, he <HI>prefer'd it before all the Wealth of a Kingdom,</HI> so, <HI>I</HI> may hum∣bly declare, I scarce ever take an <HI>Hebrew Bible</HI> into my Hands, but I am gratefully surprized with something I never thought of; I ever have some <HI>new View,</HI> and see something I never saw be∣fore. So that I do not wonder at <HI>Luther</HI> for mak∣ing a <HI>serious Protestation,</HI> that what <HI>Knowledge</HI> he had of the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> was of more Use and more Price to him, than the greatest <HI>Heap of Gold</HI> that could be set before him.</P>
<P>Indeed, I cannot but wish, that a Knowledge of the SYRIAC may come in, as an <HI>Appendix</HI> to your Knowledge of the <HI>Hebrew:</HI> Not meerly be∣cause it was the <HI>Mother-Tongue</HI> unto the Writers of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> [which is the Reason that we have no Greek Word of the <HI>Dual Number</HI> in all the <HI>New Testament;</HI> For that Number is what the <HI>Syriac</HI> is a Stranger to:] But chiefly because the most Valuable and Serviceable Version that
<PB N="32" REF="002772_0029_0FE62EA0B54000F8"/>we have of the Divine Oracles, and what may be of most Authority in many Important Points to clear up the Sense of them, is the <HI>Syriac.</HI> And having once got the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> you'l find the <HI>Syriac</HI> easily come-at-able.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Living Tongues,</HI> 'tis a Matter of some Speculation, that almost all the <HI>Protestants</HI> in the World, speak the <HI>Teutonic</HI> and what is derived from it; almost all the <HI>Romanists</HI> are found in the Derivations from the <HI>Latin;</HI> the <HI>Greek Church</HI> is mostly in the <HI>Sclavonic.</HI> If you intend any Ser∣vice to the Kingdom of GOD abroad, you may here take your Choice. But if you have any Time in your <HI>Short Life</HI> to spare for the <HI>Living Tongues,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> will be sure in the first Place to <HI>Court</HI> you. And, tho' the Complement which the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have paid unto that Lan∣guage, has look'd like a paving of the Way, (which doubtless, the <HI>French Academy</HI> have had in their Eye) for the <HI>extending</HI> of a Covetous and Ambiti∣ous Monarchy, <HI>To what will never be accomplished;</HI> yet, for the sake of your Admission to the Read∣ing of many <HI>French Books</HI> that may be worth your Perusal, I do not forbid your Learning of it. This, the rather, for that albeit the <HI>English Tongue</HI> is ca∣pable of being made the most Expressive, and the most Copious in the World, and is in these Re∣gards much Superiour to the <HI>French;</HI> neverthe∣less, it may be observed, There is no Man who has the <HI>French Tongue,</HI> but ordinarily he speaks the neater <HI>English</HI> for it.</P>
<P>And yet, concerning the <HI>Languages</HI> in general; The <HI>Time</HI> allowed for them, should certainly be
<PB N="33" REF="002772_0029_0FE62EA0B54000F8"/>proportion'd unto the <HI>Use</HI> you are like to make of them▪ Dr. <HI>More</HI> governing himself in the Study of the <HI>Oriental Tongues</HI> by that Rule, pleasantly and modestly compared himself unto the Man who passed by a <HI>Garrison,</HI> with an <HI>Horse Shoe</HI> at his <HI>Girdle;</HI> which received and repelled the <HI>Bul∣let</HI> shot upon him: On which he observed, <HI>That a little Armour, if well placed, will be sufficient.</HI> I have known One who has been able to compose and publish Things in <HI>Seven Languages;</HI> and yet con∣fessed to his Friends, <HI>That he could never get the Time to furnish himself with much more than the Armour of his well placed Horse Shoe.</HI> But be sure, so much of the <HI>Armour</HI> as you cannot but foresee you may have Occasion for, — So much I insist upon. I am far from urging you to study so many Lan∣guages as the Epitaph of that Great and Good Physician <HI>Kirstenius,</HI> asribed unto him the Know∣ledge of.</P>
<P>§. 7. The <HI>Languages</HI> you will consider, but as <HI>Instruments</HI> to come at the <HI>Sciences,</HI> wherewith you would propose to go <HI>Skilfully</HI> about the Work which your GOD shall call you to. And esteem∣ing them as rather <HI>Helps</HI> to <HI>Exudition</HI> than any <HI>Parts</HI> of it, you will no more Value yourself as a <HI>Scholar</HI> for <HI>Them,</HI> than the Bare having of <HI>Tools</HI> would make one to boast himself an <HI>Artist.</HI></P>
<P>If you would make a short Work of all the <HI>Sci∣ences,</HI> and find out a <HI>North-West Passage</HI> to them, I cannot think of any One Author, that would answer every Intention so well as ALSTED.

<PB N="34" REF="002772_0030_0FE62EA5950B7768"/>made of his <HI>Concise Exhibitions,</HI> is to me, One of the Things that I can't but wonder at, and scarce know what to make of.</P>
<P>Instead of Squandering away your Time, on the RHETORIC, whereof no doubt, you tho't, your <HI>Dugard</HI> gave you enough at School; and up∣on all the <HI>Tropes</HI> and <HI>Schemes</HI> whereof a just Cen∣surer well observes, <HI>Possunt una at{que} altera Hora ita notari, ut corum Notitia per omnem Aetatem sufficiat;</HI> And the very Profession whereof usually is little more than to furnish out a <HI>Stage-Player;</HI> My Ad∣vice to you, is, That you observe the Flowres and Airs of such <HI>Writings,</HI> as are most in Reputation for their <HI>Elegancy.</HI> Yet I am willing that you should attentively Read over <HI>Smith,</HI> his, <HI>Mystery of Rhetoric Unveiled,</HI> that you may not be Ignorant of what <HI>Figures</HI> they pretend unto.</P>
<P>But I will take this Opportunity to tell you, That there is no where to be found any such <HI>Rhe∣toric,</HI> as there is in our <HI>Sacred Scriptures.</HI> Even a Pagan <HI>Longinus</HI> himself, will confess, The <HI>Sublime,</HI> shining in them. There can be nothing so <HI>Beau∣tiful,</HI> or so <HI>Affectuous</HI> as the <HI>Figures</HI> every where used in them. They are <HI>Life.</HI> All meer <HI>Humane Flourishes</HI> are but <HI>Chaff</HI> to the <HI>Wheat</HI> that is there. Yea, they are an <HI>Hammer that breaks the Rocks to Pieces.</HI> In them the <HI>GOD of Glory Thunders,</HI> yea, does it very <HI>marvellously!</HI> There is in them that <HI>Voice of the Lord</HI> which is <HI>full of Majesty.</HI> For the <HI>Pulpit-Oratory,</HI> which is what you have in View, there can be nothing more adviseable, than to be a Master of <HI>Scripture-Phrases,</HI> and employ them with an agreeable Ingenuity, on all fit Occasions.
<PB N="35" REF="002772_0030_0FE62EA5950B7768"/>I will add, I know not but a <HI>Lamy,</HI> in his <HI>L'Art de Parler,</HI> may give you some hints that may be not unuseful to you.</P>
<P>Nor can I encourage you to spend very much Time, in that which goes under the Name of LOGIC. If my excellent Friend <HI>Langius,</HI> in his Noble <HI>Medicina Mentis,</HI> [which I commend unto you, to be diligently perused, as an <HI>Introduction</HI> to all your Studies of the <HI>Sciences,</HI>] had not com∣pelled me to a Contempt of the <HI>Vulgar Logic,</HI> learnt in our Colleges, as a sort of meer <HI>Morology,</HI> yet a little serious Recollection would have brought me to it. What is there usually got by the <HI>Vulgar Logic,</HI> but only to be furnished with a Parcel of <HI>Terms,</HI> which instead of leading the Mind into the <HI>Truth,</HI> enables one rather to carry on <HI>Altercations,</HI> and <HI>Logomachies,</HI> by which the Force of <HI>Truth</HI> may be at Pleasure, and by some little <HI>Trick,</HI> evaded. The Power and Process of <HI>Reason</HI> is <HI>Natural</HI> to the Soul of Man; And those <HI>Masters of Reason,</HI> who argue the most <HI>Rationally,</HI> and make the most <HI>Rational Researches</HI> into the true State of Things, and who take the most <HI>Rea∣sonable Measures</HI> for their Conduct, and who in all things arrive to the most notable Discoveries, <HI>I</HI> pray, what sort of <HI>Logicians</HI> are they? Either they never once read a Page of any <HI>Burgesdicius,</HI> or else they have unlearnt and forgot all their <HI>Vulgar Logic. I</HI> am sure, they rarely trouble their Heads to recall the <HI>Old Rules</HI> which they have recited unto their Tutors. To exhibit in the pompous Form of an <HI>Art,</HI> what every One does by meer <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Custom,</HI> and fabricate it into such a
<PB N="36" REF="002772_0031_0FE62EA59ACED2D0"/>shape as that of the <HI>Vulgar Logic,</HI> and with such trifling Applications and Illustrations, as 'tis usu∣ally done, appears as impertinent, as if one should with much Formality teach the <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Eating</HI> or <HI>Drinking</HI> or <HI>Walking.</HI> And it might with equal Solemnity be shown, what Points of <HI>Regular Ma∣nagement</HI> are exemplified by the Boys playing at their Marbles. The most Valuable Thing in <HI>Lo∣gic,</HI> and the very Termination of it, is, <HI>The Doc∣trine of Syllogisms.</HI> And yet it is notorious, that as all <HI>Syllogizing</HI> is only to confirm you in a <HI>Truth</HI> which you are already the Owner of, so, no <HI>Lo∣gic</HI> has yet given us all the several Ways of <HI>Syllo∣gizing</HI> that may be run into; And it is as notori∣ous, that while an expanded <HI>Syllogizing</HI> is rec∣koned no other than an Indecency in ordinary <HI>Writing</HI> as well as <HI>Talking,</HI> our only <HI>Syllogizing</HI> is that which we call, <HI>An Enthymeme:</HI> Such a thing is evident, and <HI>therefore</HI> such a Thing to be infer∣red from it, is also evident. <HI>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them,</HI> go dip into your <HI>Logic.</HI> But count it enough, if you have gone through a <HI>Milton,</HI> or a <HI>Gutberleth,</HI> or a <HI>Watts.</HI> Indeed, some Treatises, that clear up the <HI>Maxims of Reason,</HI> and may Strengthen you and Sharpen you in the Use of it, you may do well to look into. The <HI>Ars Cogitendi,</HI> may pass for One of those: And tho' for some Reasons, I would be excused from Re∣commending an <HI>Essay of Humane Understanding,</HI> which is much in Vogue, yet I can approve your perusing of <HI>Oldfield,</HI> his <HI>Improvement of Reason.</HI> But for the <HI>Vulgar Logic,</HI> I must freely say, you lose Time, if you steer any otherwise in it, than, <HI>Touch and Go.</HI></P>

What I say of <HI>Logic,</HI> I say of <HI>Metaphysicks;</HI> which a learned Man too justly calls, <HI>Disciplinarum Omnium Excrementum,</HI> tho' she would set up for the <HI>Queen of Sciences.</HI> If you have got a <HI>Maccovi∣us,</HI> or a <HI>Jacchaeus</HI> into your Head, you have as much as I should care for: To which indeed some Acquaintance with a <HI>Castanaeus,</HI> or some such <HI>Fencer</HI> for <HI>Distinctions,</HI> may be added. But then to Weave any more <HI>Cobwebs</HI> in your Brains; to what Purpose is it? This however, is one of the <HI>Things,</HI> which I will <HI>Affirm constantly;</HI> That as a <HI>Suarez,</HI> than whom you cannot easily find a greater dealer in <HI>Metaphysicks,</HI> after all declared, The <HI>Hours</HI> which he took in Studying and Ex∣amining and Rectifying his <HI>own Heart,</HI> were of infinitely more Use and Worth to him than all his <HI>Metaphysical</HI> and Voluminous Lucubrations; you shall in like manner find, that you may easily employ your <HI>Hours</HI> to better Purpose, than in <HI>Metaphysical</HI> and Imaginary Disquisitions.</P>
<P>As for ETHICS, tho' such Things as the, <HI>Ethi∣ca Christiana</HI> of a <HI>Daneus,</HI> be among the <HI>Things which cannot be spoken against,</HI> yet of <HI>That</HI> whereon they employ the <HI>Plough</HI> so long in many Acade∣mies, I will venture to say, 'tis a <HI>Vile Thing;</HI> and no other than what honest <HI>Vockerodus</HI> has justly called it; <HI>Impietas in Artis formam redacta.</HI> It is all over a <HI>Sham;</HI> It presents you with a <HI>Mock-Happiness;</HI> It prescribes to you <HI>Mock Vertues</HI> for the coming at it: And it pretends to give you a Religion without a CHRIST, and a <HI>Life</HI> of PIE∣TY without a <HI>Living Principle;</HI> a <HI>Good Life</HI> with no other than <HI>Dead Works</HI> filling of it. It is not
<PB N="38" REF="002772_0032_0FE62EAE88EBD040"/>amiss for you, to know what this <HI>Paganism</HI> is; and therefore you may, if you please, bestow a short Reading upon a <HI>Golius,</HI> or a <HI>More:</HI> But be more of a <HI>Christian,</HI> than to look on the <HI>Enchiri∣dion</HI> of the Author last mentioned, as, <HI>Next the Bible, the best Book in the World.</HI> Study no other <HI>Ethics,</HI> but what is in the <HI>Bible;</HI> and consult such Books, as the, <HI>Verus Christianismus</HI> of an <HI>Arndt,</HI> whereby Hundreds of Thousands have been bro't into the Life of GOD.</P>
<P>So much <HI>Ethics</HI> as treats, <HI>De Decorc,</HI> and may instruct you in the, <HI>Rules of Behaviour,</HI> I bearrily commend unto you. And yet, even <HI>these</HI> are best learnt by a Wise Observation of what you see passes in the Conversation of Politer People: And by wisely considering how they are indeed all <HI>Embryo'd</HI> in that one Word, MODESTY; which Renders every one his <HI>Due,</HI> and assumes nothing <HI>undue</HI> to ones self: Or, comprized in that one Maxim, <HI>Do and Say nothing that may be justly offensive to the Company.</HI> The Truth is; The most exact and constant <HI>Rules of Behaviour,</HI> will be found <HI>Rules of Christianity:</HI> For which Cause it pleased our Glorious Redeemer more than once to give them. Every <HI>Christian</HI> as far as he keeps to his own <HI>Rules</HI> will be so far a <HI>Gentleman.</HI> And for this Cause, I again advise you to a Careful Study of them.</P>
<P>§. 8. POETRY, whereof we have now even an <HI>Antediluvian Piece</HI> in our Hands, has from the Beginning been in such Request, that I must needs recommend unto you some Acquaintance with it. Though some have had a Soul so <HI>Unmu∣sical,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="002772_0032_0FE62EAE88EBD040"/>that they have decried all <HI>Verse,</HI> as being but a meer <HI>Playing</HI> and <HI>Fiddling</HI> upon <HI>Words;</HI> All <HI>Versi∣fying,</HI> as if it were more <HI>Unnatural</HI> than if we should chuse <HI>Dancing</HI> instead of <HI>Walking;</HI> and <HI>Ryme,</HI> as if it were but a sort of <HI>Morisco Dancing</HI> with <HI>Bells:</HI> Yet I cannot wish you a Soul that shall be wholly <HI>Unpoetical.</HI> An Old <HI>Horace</HI> has left us an <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> which you may do well to bestow a Perusal on. And besides your <HI>Lyrick Hours,</HI> I wish you may so far understand an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> that the Beauties of an <HI>Homer</HI> and a <HI>Virgil</HI> may be discerned with you. As to the <HI>Moral</HI> Part of <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI> 'tis true, and let me not be counted a <HI>Zoilus</HI> for saying so, that by first exhibiting their <HI>Gods</HI> as no better than <HI>Rogues,</HI> he set open the Flood∣gates for a prodigious Inundation of Wickedness to break in upon the Nations, and was one of the <HI>greatest Apostles</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> ever had in the World. Among the rest that felt the Ill Impressions of this <HI>Universal Corrupter,</HI> (as Men of the best Sen∣timents have called him,) One was that over∣grown Robber, of execrable Memory, whom we celebrate under the Name of <HI>Alexander the Great;</HI> who by his continual Admiring and Studying of his <HI>Iliad,</HI> and by following that false Model of Heroic Virtue set before him in his <HI>Achilles,</HI> be∣came one of the worst of Men, and at length in∣flated with the Ridiculous Pride of being himself a <HI>Deity,</HI> exposed himself to all the Scorn that could belong unto a <HI>Lunatick.</HI> And hence, notwith∣standing the Veneration which this Idol has had, yet <HI>Plato</HI> banishes him our of a <HI>Common-Wealth,</HI> the Welfare whereof he was concerned for. Never∣theless, <HI>Custom</HI> or <HI>Conscience</HI> obliges him to bear
<PB N="40" REF="002772_0033_0FE62EAE8D9631F8"/>Testimonies unto many Points of <HI>Morality.</HI> And it is especially observable, That he commonly pro∣pounds <HI>Prayer</HI> to Heaven as a most necessary Pre∣face unto all Important Enterprizes; and when the Action comes on too suddenly for a more ex∣tended <HI>Supplication,</HI> he yet will not let it come on without an Ejaculation; and he never speaks of any <HI>Supplication</HI> but he brings in a Gracious Ans∣wer to it. I have seen a Travesteering <HI>High-Flyer,</HI> not much to our Dishonour, Scoff at <HI>Homer</HI> for this; as making his Actors to be like those whom the English call <HI>Dissenters.</HI> But then, we are so much led into the Knowledge of <HI>Antiqui∣ties,</HI> by reading of this <HI>Poet,</HI> and into so many Parts of the <HI>Recondite Learning,</HI> that notwithstand∣ing some little <HI>Nods</HI> in him, not a few Acute Pens besides the old Bishop of <HI>Thessalonica</HI>'s, have got a Reputation by regaling us with <HI>Annotations</HI> upon him. Yea, Tho' One can't but smile at the Fan∣cy of <HI>Croese,</HI> who tries with much Ostentation of Erudition, to show, That <HI>Homer</HI> has all along ten∣dred us in a Disguise and Fable, the <HI>History of the Old Testament,</HI> yet many Illustrations of the <HI>sacred Scriptures,</HI> I find are to be fetched from him; who indeed had probably read what was Extant of them in his Days; Particularly, Our <HI>Eighteenth Psalm</HI> is what he has evidently imitated. <HI>Virgil</HI> too, who so much lived upon him, as well as after him, is unaccountably mad upon his <HI>Fate,</HI> which he makes to be he knows not what himself, but Superiour to <HI>Gods</HI> as well as to <HI>Men,</HI> and thro' his whole Composures he so asserts the Doctrine of this Nonsensical Power, as is plainly inconsistent with all Virtue. And what <HI>fatal Mischief</HI> did
<PB N="41" REF="002772_0033_0FE62EAE8D9631F8"/><HI>Fascinator</HI> do to the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> when by Dei∣fying one Great Emperor, he taught the Succes∣sors to claim the Adoration of <HI>Gods,</HI> while they were perpetrating the Crimes of <HI>Devils?</HI> I will not be a <HI>Carbilius</HI> upon him; nor will I say any thing, how little the <HI>Married State</HI> owes unto One who writes as if he were a <HI>Woman hater:</HI> Nor what his Blunders are about his poor-spirited and inconsistent <HI>Hero,</HI> for which many have taxed him. Nevertheless, 'tis observed, That the Pagans had no <HI>Rules of Manners,</HI> that were more Laudable and Regular than what are to be found in him. And some have said, It is <HI>hardly possible seriously to Read his Works without being more disposed unto Good∣ness, as well as being agreeably entertained.</HI> Be sure, had <HI>Virgil</HI> wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before <HI>Plato,</HI> his Works had not been any of the <HI>Books prohibited.</HI> But then, This <HI>Poet</HI> also has abundance of Rare <HI>Antiquities</HI> for us: And such Things, as others besides a <HI>Servius,</HI> have imagined that they have instructed and obliged Mankind, by employing all their Days upon. Wherefore if his <HI>Aeneis,</HI> which tho' it were once near twenty times as big as he has left it, yet he has left it unfinished, may not appear so valuable to you, that you may think <HI>Twenty seven Verses</HI> of the Part that is the most finished in it, worth One and Twenty Hundred Pounds and odd Money, yet his <HI>Georgicks,</HI> which he put his last Hand unto, will furnish you with many things far from Des∣picable. But after all, when I said, I was willing that the <HI>Beauties</HI> of these <HI>Two Poets,</HI> might become <HI>Visible</HI> to your <HI>Visive Faculty</HI> in <HI>Poetry,</HI> I did not mean, that you should Judge nothing to be Ad∣mittable into an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> which is not Autho∣rised
<PB N="42" REF="002772_0034_0FE62EBAACCA4730"/>by their Example; but I perfectly concur with One who is inexpressibly more capable to be a Judge of such a Matter than I can be; That it is a <HI>false Critic</HI> who <HI>with a petulant Air, will insult Reason itself, if it presumes to oppose such Authority:</HI></P>
<P>I proceed now to say, That if (under the Gui∣dance of a <HI>Vida</HI>) you try your young Wings now and then to see what Flights you can make, at least for an <HI>Epigram,</HI> it may a little sharpen your <HI>Sense,</HI> and polish your <HI>Style,</HI> for more important Performances; For this Purpose you are now e∣ven overstock'd with <HI>Patterns,</HI> and — <HI>Poemata Passim.</HI> You may, like <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> all your Days, make a little <HI>Recreation</HI> of <HI>Poetry</HI> in the midst of your more painful Studies. Nevertheless, I can∣not but advise you, <HI>Withhold thy Throat from Thirst.</HI> Be not so set upon <HI>Poetry,</HI> as to be always poring on the <HI>Passionate</HI> and <HI>Measured</HI> Pages. Let not what should be <HI>Sauce</HI> rather than <HI>Food</HI> for you, En∣gross all your Application. Beware of a <HI>Bound∣less</HI> and <HI>Sickly</HI> Appetite, for the Reading of the <HI>Poems,</HI> which now the <HI>Rickety</HI> Nation swarms with∣al: And let not the <HI>Circaean</HI> Cup intoxicate you. But especially preserve the <HI>Chastity</HI> of your Soul from the Dangers you may incur, by a Conversa∣tion with <HI>Muses</HI> that are no better than <HI>Harlots:</HI> Among which are others besides <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Epistles, which for their Tendency to excite and foment Impure <HI>Flames,</HI> and cast <HI>Coals</HI> into your <HI>Bosom,</HI> deserve rather to be thrown into the <HI>Fire,</HI> than to be laid before the <HI>Eye</HI> which a <HI>Covenant</HI> should be <HI>made</HI> withal.

<P>[There has been a deal of a do about a STYLE; So much, that I must offer you my Sentiments upon it. There is a <HI>Way of Writing,</HI> wherein the Author endeavours, that the Reader may have <HI>something to the Purpose</HI> in every Paragraph. There is not only a <HI>Vigour</HI> sensible in every <HI>Sentence,</HI> but the Paragraph is embellished with <HI>Profitable Refer∣ences,</HI> even to something beyond what is <HI>directly spoken.</HI> Formal and Painful <HI>Quotations</HI> are not studied; yet all that could be learnt from them is insinuated. The Writer pretends not unto <HI>Read∣ing,</HI> yet he could not have writ as he does if he had not <HI>Read</HI> very much in his Time; and his Composures are not only a <HI>Cloth of Gold,</HI> but also stuck with as many <HI>Jewels,</HI> as the Gown of a Russian Embassador. This <HI>Way of Writing</HI> has been decried by many, and is at this Day more than ever so, for the same Reason, that in the old Story, the <HI>Grapes</HI> were decried, <HI>That they were not Ripe.</HI> A Lazy, Ignorant, Conceited Sett of Au∣thors, would perswade the whole Tribe, to lay a∣side that <HI>Way of Writing,</HI> for the same Reason that one would have perswaded his Brethren to part with the Encumbrance of their <HI>Busby Tails.</HI> But▪
however <HI>Fashion</HI> and <HI>Humour</HI> may prevail, they must not think that the Club at their <HI>Coffee-House</HI> is, <HI>All the World;</HI> but there will always be those, who will in this Case be governed by <HI>In∣disputable Reason:</HI> And who will think, that the

For indeed no Two of them have the same <HI>Style;</HI> and they are as intollerably Cross-grain'd and severe in their Censures upon one another, as they are upon the rest of Mankind. But while each of them, con∣ceitedly enough, sets up for the <HI>Standard of Perfec∣tion,</HI> we are entirely at a Loss which <HI>Fire</HI> to fol∣low. Nor can you easily find any one thing wherein they agree for their <HI>Style,</HI> except perhaps a perpetual Care to give us Jejune and Empty Pages, without such <HI>Touches of Erudition</HI> (to speak in the <HI>Style</HI> of an Ingenious Traveller) as may make the Discourses less <HI>Tedious,</HI> and more <HI>Enrich∣ing,</HI> to the Mind of him that peruses them. There is much Talk of a <HI>Florid Style,</HI> obtaining among the Pens, that are most in Vogue; but how often would it puzzle one, even with the best Glasses to find the <HI>Flowres!</HI> And if they were to be Chas∣tized
<PB N="46" REF="002772_0036_0FE62EBBC0F42400"/>for it, it would be with much what as much of Justice, as <HI>Jerom</HI> was, for being a <HI>Cic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ronian.</HI> Af∣ter all, Every Man will have his own <HI>Style,</HI> which will distinguish him as much as his <HI>Gate:</HI> And if you can attain to that which I have newly des∣cribed, but always writing so as to give an <HI>Easy Conveyance</HI> unto your <HI>Idea</HI>'s, I would not have you by any <HI>Scourging</HI> be driven out of your <HI>Gate,</HI> but if you must confess a <HI>Fault</HI> in it, make a Confessi∣on like that of the Lad, unto his Father while he was beating him for his <HI>Versifying.</HI></P>
<P>However, since every Man will have his own Style, I would pray, that we may learn to treat one another with mutual <HI>Civilities,</HI> and <HI>Condescen∣sions,</HI> and handsomely <HI>indulge</HI> one another in this, as <HI>Gentlemen</HI> do in other Matters.</P>
<P>I wonder what ails People, that they can't let <HI>Cicero</HI> write in the <HI>Style</HI> of <HI>Cicero,</HI> and <HI>Seneca</HI> write in the (much other!) <HI>Style</HI> of <HI>Seneca;</HI> and own that <HI>Both</HI> may please in their <HI>several Ways.</HI> — But I will freely tell you; what has made me consider the <HI>Humcurists</HI> that set up for <HI>Criticks upon Style,</HI> as the most <HI>Unregardable Set of Mortals</HI> in the World, is This! Far more Illustrious <HI>Criticks</HI> than any of those to whom I am now bidding Defi∣ance, and no less Men than your <HI>Erasmus</HI>'s, and your <HI>Grotius</HI>'s, have taxed the <HI>Greek Style</HI> of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> with I know not what <HI>Sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecisms</HI> and <HI>Barbarisms;</HI> And, how many <HI>learned Folks</HI> have Obsequiously run away with the Notion!

<P>Do it, with a <HI>Design</HI> to be led into those <HI>Views</HI> wherewith you will in Ways most Worthy of a <HI>Man</HI> effectually <HI>Show yourself a Man,</HI> and may with Unutterable Satisfaction answer the main END of your Being, which is, To Glorify GOD; and therein also Discharge the Office of a <HI>Priest</HI> for the Creation; which, how sweet a, <HI>Token for Good,</HI> must it be unto you!</P>
<P>When I said, <HI>Natural Phylosophy,</HI> you may be sure, I did not mean, the <HI>Peripatetic:</HI> For I hear∣tily subscribe to the Censure of <HI>Christianus Thomasius</HI> upon it; <HI>Omne Tempus pro Perdito judicandum, quod in Physicam Peripateticor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m impenditur; ita inepta et stulta ibi sunt Omnia.</HI> It is indeed amazing to see the Fate of the Writings which go under the Name of <HI>Aristotle.</HI> First falling into the hands of
<PB N="48" REF="002772_0037_0FE62EBBC575FAD0"/>those who could not <HI>Read</HI> them, and yet for the sake of the Famous Author were willing to <HI>keep</HI> them; they were for a long while hid <HI>under Ground,</HI> where many of them <HI>deserved</HI> a Lodging. And from this Place of Darkness the Torn or Worn Manuscripts were anon fetched out; and imperfectly and unfaithfully enough transcribed, and conveyed from <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> where <HI>Copies</HI> were in like Manner taken of them. The <HI>Sara∣cens</HI> by'nd by got them, and (the Concise and Broken Style a little suiting them) they spoke <HI>Arabic;</HI> and even in <HI>Africa</HI> there were many <HI>A∣ristotelean Schools</HI> erected. They were from thence brought over into <HI>Spain,</HI> and Exhibited with such <HI>Translations</HI> and <HI>Commentaries</HI> as it pleased the <HI>Ara∣bians</HI> to bestow upon them. When <HI>Learning</HI> re∣vived under <HI>Charlemaigne,</HI> all <HI>Europe</HI> turned <HI>Aristo∣telean;</HI> yea, in some <HI>Universities</HI> they swore Alle∣giance to him; and, O Monstrous! if I am not misinformed, they do in some <HI>Universities</HI> at this Day foolishly and profanely on their Knees con∣tinue to do so. With the <HI>Vile Person</HI> that made himself the Head of the Church at <HI>Rome,</HI> this Muddy-headed Pagan <HI>divided the Empire</HI> over the Christian World; but extended his Empire further than <HI>he,</HI> or ever any <HI>Tamerlane.</HI> For the very <HI>Jews</HI> themselves became his Vassals, with a Tra∣dition of his having some <HI>Relation</HI> to, or at least some <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with, their Fathers. And tho' <HI>Europe</HI> has, with fierce and long Struggles about it, begun to shake off the Shackles, he does to This Day, under the Name of <HI>Aplis,</HI> continue to Ty∣rannize over Humane Understanding in a great Part of the <HI>Oriental World.</HI> No Mortal else ever
<PB N="49" REF="002772_0037_0FE62EBBC575FAD0"/>had such a Prerogative to <HI>Govern Mankind,</HI> as this <HI>Philosopher;</HI> who after the prodigious Cartloads of Stuff, that has been Written to explain him [For within a few Centuries after <HI>Albertus Mag∣nus,</HI> there were Twelve Thousand Authors that wrote upon him; or followed him and defended him; and by a probable Computation, there have since been more than as many more!] he yet remains in many other Things besides his <HI>Entelechia</HI> sufficiently <HI>Unintelligible,</HI> and forever in almost all things <HI>Unprofitable. Avicen,</HI> after he had read his <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> Forty times over, and had them all by Heart, was forced after all, to lay them aside, in Despair of ever Understanding them. Have done then, with your <HI>Magirus,</HI> and your <HI>Eustachius,</HI> and your <HI>Heereboord;</HI> and the rest of the <HI>Jargon-Writers.</HI> Just so far as to <HI>see a little what they say,</HI> you may look into them; <HI>Whatsoever is more, cometh of Evil,</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> will <HI>Come</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Some Eminent Persons, besides a <HI>Sennertus</HI> and a <HI>Val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sius,</HI> tired with the <HI>Academical Futilities,</HI> have at length betaken themselves to the best School for <HI>Philosophy</HI> as well as for <HI>Theology.</HI> The <HI>Mosaic Philosophy</HI> in the Scheme that <HI>Comenius</HI> has given of it, is much admired and embraced in some Re∣forming Universities; and you will do well to bestow a deliberate Reading upon it. The, <HI>Phi∣losophia Vetus ac Vera,</HI> of the rare <HI>Dickinson,</HI> has given us a yet finer Piece of <HI>Mosaic Work,</HI> which must always be honourably spoken of. But, tho' it be true, that the <HI>Sacred Scriptures</HI> have a <HI>wondrous Philosophy</HI> in them, and a Memorable <HI>Dutchman</HI> has lately demonstrated, that, according to what every Day makes more and more Evident, the
<PB N="50" REF="002772_0038_0FE62ECAB2B54AF0"/><HI>Prophetic Spirit</HI> from whose <HI>Inspiration</HI> they are given to us, <HI>knew</HI> and <HI>own'd,</HI> the now most indis∣puted Things which occur in the Discoveries of our <HI>Modern Philosophy;</HI> yet it is now plain, the First Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> (as well as the rest of the <HI>Bible,</HI> which refers to the <HI>System of the World,</HI>) has not been well understood by most of the Gentlemen that have writ upon it. However, because of the Regard therein paid unto <HI>Moses,</HI> and the <HI>Tra∣duction of our Philosophy from the Holy Fountains,</HI> (tho' <HI>Plato</HI> be advanced with him) I do particularly approve your perusing of the, <HI>Philosophia generalis,</HI> written by our equally Modest and Learned <HI>Gale,</HI> so as to make yourself a Master of it. I cannot but confess, that the <HI>Hypotheses</HI> which the more Ingenious and Inquisitive <HI>Sons of the Wild Asses Colt,</HI> have hitherto mostly valued themselves up∣on, have been too justly called, <HI>Philosophical Ro∣mances,</HI> and it may be, what is now most in Vogue, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>non be refuted and refused like its Predeces∣sors. Nevertheless, I would have you take wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may appear least likely to prove <HI>Romantic:</HI> And therefore, as thorough an Insight as you can get into the <HI>Principles</HI> of our <HI>Perpetual Dictator,</HI> the Incomparable Sr. <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> is what I mighti∣ly commend unto you.</P>
<P>Be sure, The <HI>Experimental Philosophy</HI> is that, in which alone your Mind can be at all establish∣ed. For this Purpose, besides your more occasio∣nally Conversing with such things as, our <HI>Philo∣sophical Transactions,</HI> and several Communications of our Illustrious <HI>Boyl,</HI> and of <HI>Hook,</HI> and of <HI>Grew,</HI> and <HI>Cheyne,</HI> and <HI>Keil,</HI> and those also that have writ∣ten the <HI>Natural History</HI> of several Places, [and
<PB N="51" REF="002772_0038_0FE62ECAB2B54AF0"/>such Outlandish Writings as those of <HI>Bartholinus,</HI> and <HI>Borellus,</HI> and the <HI>German Ephemerides</HI>] I would Commend unto you, <HI>The Religious Philosopher,</HI> of the Admirable <HI>Nieuentyt;</HI> and what has been com∣municated by our Industrious <HI>Ray,</HI> and our Inge∣nuous <HI>Derham,</HI> who still nobly serve <HI>Religion</HI> as well as <HI>Philosophy.</HI> And whatever it might be for <HI>me</HI> to say so unto <HI>any One else,</HI> I hope, it will be no Indecency for me to say so unto <HI>you;</HI> That if you desire to see the largest Collection, I have yet seen of the <HI>Discoveries</HI> which the last Age has made in <HI>Philosophy,</HI> adapted unto the general Capa∣city of Readers; and short Essays upon every Article, to Show and Raise those Dispositions of PIETY, wherein the <HI>Works</HI> of the Holy and Bles∣sed GOD invite us to <HI>Live</HI> unto Him; together with the <HI>First Claim</HI> that I have ever yet seen so explicitly made on the behalf of a Glorious CHRIST, and the Consideration due to him in our <HI>Philosophy;</HI> you have this prepared for you in a Book Entituled, THE CHRISTIAN PHILO∣SOPHER.</P>
<P>Above all, I would have you see to it, that you be not, like some haughty, and short-sighted, and half-witted, <HI>Smatterers in Philosophy,</HI> seduced into the <HI>Folly</HI> of doubting the <HI>Existence</HI> or <HI>Provi∣dence</HI> of a Glorious GOD, by a Study, which, if well-pursued, would <HI>Compel you to come in</HI> to a <HI>Strong Faith,</HI> wherewith you would <HI>give Glory</HI> to Him, on all Occasions. I hope, every step of your Study, will give you more and more Satis∣faction, of what One of our Best Philosophers, the Author of, <HI>The Natural History of the Earth,</HI> ad∣heres unto; <HI>That as the World was at first Created,
<PB N="52" REF="002772_0039_0FE62ECAB76F6BE8"/>so it has been ever since preserved, by the Immediate Hand of GOD.</HI> You will see, That the Influences of one thing upon another in the <HI>Course of Nature</HI> are purely from the Omnipotent and Omnipresent GOD, actually forever at Work, according to His own <HI>Laws,</HI> and putting His <HI>Laws</HI> in Execu∣tion, and as the <HI>Universal Cause</HI> producing those Effects, whereof the <HI>Creatures</HI> are but what One may call, <HI>The Occasional Causes.</HI> You will also be often and quickly carried up into those <HI>Immechan∣ical Principles,</HI> from whence, <HI>The next step is into GOD!</HI> The <HI>Gravitation</HI> of Bodies is One of them; For which <HI>No Cause</HI> can be assigned, but the <HI>Will</HI> of the Glorious GOD, who is the <HI>First Cause</HI> of all. <HI>Child, See GOD in every Thing!</HI> Own Him, Fear Him, Love Him; Study <HI>Philosophy</HI> with a perpetual Intention to do so. Remember, GOD is to <HI>Spirits,</HI> what <HI>Center</HI> is to <HI>Bodies.</HI> And, A Mind that from the View of the Glorious GOD in his <HI>Works,</HI> is carried into Acknowledgements of a <HI>GOD infinitely Worthy to be Loved and Praised and Served and Relied upon,</HI> becomes a <HI>Temple</HI> filled with the <HI>Glory of the Lord.</HI> Visit for this Purpose the several Classes of the Creatures: <HI>Walk</HI> thro' the World; [and be so far a <HI>Peripatetic!</HI>] and in this generous Exercise, <HI>Fear GOD and give Glory unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>§ 10. The MATHEMATICKS will be, next unto <HI>Philosophy,</HI> a noble Study for you; The most Essential Parts whereof, you have in the <HI>Cursus Mathematious</HI> of an <HI>Ozanam</HI> so delivered unto you, that indeed you will hardly need any more. Tho' you are shaping for a <HI>Divine,</HI> yet I should not be sorry to see you as Exquisite a <HI>Mathematician</HI> as
<PB N="53" REF="002772_0039_0FE62ECAB76F6BE8"/>the Excellent <HI>Pitiscus,</HI> who, tho' he were a <HI>Divine,</HI> yet without a Tutor became such an <HI>High Attain∣er</HI> in this <HI>Real Learning,</HI> that <HI>Melchior Adam</HI> cries out, <HI>Illud Mirandum!</HI> upon it: And it caused the Noble <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> to say, <HI>Optarem plures ejus∣modi Concionatores reperiri: forte plus esset in iis Cir∣cumspecti et Solidi Judicii.</HI> I should not be sorry to see a <HI>Wallis,</HI> or a <HI>Wilkins,</HI> or a <HI>Barrow,</HI> revived in you, if your <HI>Genius</HI> lead you to it.</P>
<P>Besides the other Uses of ARITHMETIC and GEOMETRY, [wherein an <HI>Hill</HI> and an <HI>Euclid,</HI> or, <HI>The Young Mathematicians Guide</HI> of a <HI>Ward,</HI> in∣stead of Both, may singularly be commended for you,] you will find this Benefit by the Study of them; They will Necessitate and Habituate your Mind unto that <HI>Strong Attention,</HI> which will mar∣vellously Qualify you for more <HI>Important Services,</HI> and make a <HI>Strong Reasoner</HI> of you, and a very Regular and Cohaerent <HI>Speaker.</HI> They were dis∣tinguished by the Name of <HI>Mathesis,</HI> and made the <HI>First Learning</HI> in some Ancient Schools, for this very Reason. And you may be sure, I should reckon it a further Encouragement unto the Study, if the <HI>General Rule</HI> might hold without any <HI>Ex∣ception,</HI> That <HI>Great Mathematicians</HI> use to be Men of <HI>Good Morals;</HI> It seems that their Intense <HI>Appli∣cations</HI> and <HI>Speculations</HI> are inconsistent with <HI>De∣baucheries.</HI> While you are thus employed, Me∣thinks, it might be a pretty Diversion to go thro' some of <HI>Leybourn</HI>'s <HI>Mathematical Recreations.</HI></P>
<P>But you must also <HI>soar Upwards,</HI> to the Attain∣ments of ASTRONOMY. For though of <HI>later Ages,</HI> the Voluminous <HI>Tostatus</HI> whom they comple∣mented as having all the Learning in the World,
<PB N="54" REF="002772_0040_0FE5F49FC3E256C8"/>were no better an <HI>Astronomer,</HI> than <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> and <HI>Ambrose,</HI> and <HI>Theodoret,</HI> and <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> and <HI>Austin</HI> himself, who in the more <HI>Early Ages</HI> de∣claimed violently against the <HI>Spherical Figure</HI> of the Heavens; I should be loth you should thro' Igno∣rance in <HI>Astronomy,</HI> ever fall into what even a <HI>Jerom</HI> would call <HI>Stultiloquium in Ecclesia.</HI> Where∣fore, I cannot but advise you to be well instruc∣ted in the <HI>Astronomical Lectures,</HI> as of an Accurate <HI>Keill,</HI> so of the Acute <HI>Whiston;</HI> while we are Mourning, that he who so excellently serves us in <HI>Astronomy,</HI> should so unhappily hurt us in <HI>Divinity,</HI> and call into Question, (as a Dubious <HI>Problem</HI>) the Infinite and Eternal <HI>Godhead</HI> of Him FOR whom, as well as BY whom, the <HI>Sun</HI> and the <HI>Stars</HI> were created.</P>
<P>At the same time, I hope, there is no need of my saying any thing to disswade you from the Study of JUDICIAL ASTROLOGY: The most <HI>Injudicious</HI> Thing in the World: All Futility; All Impiety; All of a Piece with the ridiculous Whim of a <HI>Gaffarel,</HI> who maintains, That the <HI>Stars</HI> in the Heavens do stand ranged in the form of <HI>Hebrew Letters,</HI> and that it is possible to <HI>Read there</HI> whatever is to happen of Importance throughout the Universe. And yet perhaps, there may be some Need for me to Caution you against being <HI>Dismay'd at the Signs of the Heavens,</HI> or having any Superstitious Fancies upon <HI>Eclipses</HI> and the like Occurrences, or thinking that if there were a <HI>Con∣junction of all the Planets</HI> in <HI>Pisces,</HI> it would por∣tend that the World should be <HI>Drowned.</HI> Yea, I am willing that the <HI>Cometomancy</HI> which has hither∣to so much reigned, even in the most <HI>Honest
<PB N="55" REF="002772_0040_0FE5F49FC3E256C8"/>Minds,</HI> be laid aside with you; and that you be apprehensive of nothing <HI>Portentous</HI> in <HI>Blazing Stars,</HI> except it should be apprehended, that in their <HI>El∣liptic Motions</HI> they may make so near an Appulse unto this Globe as to bring some Confusion upon it. For my Part, I know not whether all our <HI>Worlds,</HI> and even the <HI>Sun</HI> it self, may not fare the better for them. Some, that know more than I, do think so. Indeed, if you perswade a World, here <HI>lying in Wickedness,</HI> there to see a <HI>Praesage,</HI> and to take a <HI>Warning,</HI> from the tremendous View of a <HI>World in a State of Punishment,</HI> I will say, <HI>Go on and Prosper.</HI></P>
<P>But I will now so far fetch you down from the <HI>Stars,</HI> and set you down on your Native Soyl, as to tell you, That there is nothing <HI>Mathematical</HI> to which I more advise you, than the easy Study of GEOGRAPHY. Perhaps the Scituation of <HI>Pa∣radise</HI> and of <HI>Palestine,</HI> and of the Places mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, may be what you would be willing to be first of all acquainted with. And for this, Let the Admirable <HI>Bochart</HI> be your princi∣pal Instructor. What has been chiefly taken from <HI>him,</HI> and from two or three more, in three or four <HI>Octavo</HI>'s under the Title of <HI>Sacred Geogra∣phy,</HI> [by one <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls,</HI>] may herein also be of some Use to you. The <HI>Pisgah Sight</HI> of a <HI>Fuller,</HI> will be read with a <HI>Pleasure</HI> equal to the <HI>Profit;</HI> and the <HI>Palestina Illustrata</HI> of a <HI>Reland,</HI> perhaps with a <HI>Profit</HI> greater than the <HI>Pleasure.</HI> But you will not give over, till more of the World, has come into your <HI>Knowledge,</HI> than the <HI>Decree</HI> of an <HI>Augustus</HI> could reach unto. Wherefore, after a <HI>Morden</HI> or a <HI>Gor∣don,</HI> [together with a <HI>Varenius,</HI>] has given you a
<PB N="56" REF="002772_0041_0FE62ECBC7A4E0F0"/>more Compendious View of the World, I say no thing of a Work Entituled, <HI>Geography Rectified,</HI> because 'tis not easy to find a Work that more wants to be <HI>Rectified;</HI> but what I say next, is, that the <HI>Atlas Geographus,</HI> will be a yet more instructive Guide for you, in your taking the Tour of the seve∣ral Regions in it. You may then, as your Inclinati∣ons may carry you, with <HI>Delight</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> make your Visits to particular Countrys and Citys, in the Descriptions given of them. And here, while I suppose, that what a <HI>Cambden</HI> has given you in his <HI>Britannia,</HI> will be no unacceptable Entertain∣ment for you, I cannot but notify it unto you, that, <HI>The English Empire in America,</HI> described by One <HI>Oldmixon,</HI> is the most foolish and faithless Performance in this Kind, that ever Mankind was abused withal. I am desirous, that you proceed and peruse many of the <HI>Travels</HI> that have been published; and (if you dare not venture upon a <HI>Purchas</HI>) by conversing with many more than what are exhibited in that Rich Collection which goes under the Name of, <HI>Itinerantium atque Navi∣gantium Bibliotheca,</HI> you may with little Expence or Hazard become a notable <HI>Traveller.</HI> In your thus <HI>Riding a Circuit,</HI> you will especially inform yourself about, <HI>The State of Religion,</HI> in the World: [And methinks, <HI>Pagets Christianography,</HI> and <HI>Brier∣wood's Enquiries,</HI> may particularly deserve a Read∣ing with you:] And you will have your Heart thereupon raised in Sentiments of <HI>Gratitude</HI> unto a <HI>Sovereign</HI> GOD, who has cast your Lot among a People whom <HI>He has known above</HI> most of <HI>the Fa∣milies of the Earth: Even so Righteous Father, for so it pleases thee!</HI> — and <HI>Compassion</HI> for a World over
<PB N="57" REF="002772_0041_0FE62ECBC7A4E0F0"/>so much of which the <HI>Powers of Darkness</HI> continue to Tyrannize: Disposed like an Owner of, <HI>Sellers New System of Geography,</HI> whom I found inserting with his Pen this Note at the End of it; <HI>Peccantis et Perditi tam vasti Mundi, miserere Deus!</HI> Yea, In fine, Let me tell you, This <HI>Easy Study</HI> will not on∣ly furnish you to maintain a <HI>Profitable Conversation,</HI> and a <HI>Communication that may minister Grace,</HI> and be ever Acceptable, to <HI>the Hearers:</HI> But if you prove a <HI>Man of Concern for the Kingdom of GOD</HI> in the World, it may bring you to form those <HI>Projec∣tions,</HI> by which, as <HI>little as you are in your own Eyes,</HI> whole Nations may anon come to fare the better for you.</P>
<P>For MUSIC, I know not what well to say. — Do as you please. If you <HI>Fancy</HI> it, I don't <HI>Forbid</HI> it. Only do not for the sake of it, Alienate your Time too much, from those that are more Impor∣tant Matters. It may be so, that you may serve your GOD the better, for the Refreshment of <HI>One that can play well on an Instrument.</HI> However, to accomplish yourself at <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> is a thing that will be of <HI>Daily Use</HI> to you. For I would not have a Day pass you without <HI>Singing,</HI> but so as at the same time to <HI>make a Melody in your Heart unto the Lord;</HI> Besides the Part you may bear, <HI>In Hymnis suavisonantis Ecclesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI></P>
<P>I will conclude this Article, with a Remark made by <HI>Perault,</HI> in his Account of <HI>Illustrious Men.</HI> Some Reproached <HI>Gassendus,</HI> for not knowing e∣nough certain parts of the <HI>Math maticks.</HI> Where∣upon he says; <Q>Whether he was actually <HI>Ignorant</HI> of what was most Abstruse in these Sciences, or whether he <HI>Neglected</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he could not but be the
<PB N="58" REF="002772_0042_0FE62ECDEA7AB9B0"/>more Commendable for it. There is something of <HI>Little,</HI> in tying ones self up too much to <HI>lit∣tle Things;</HI> and even of <HI>Imprudence</HI> too, to con∣sume therein a <HI>Time,</HI> which may be employed more usefully on other Knowledge.</Q></P>
<P>§. 11. If the Emperor <HI>Basil</HI> had not in his In∣structions to a <HI>Son,</HI> recommended unto him HIS∣TORY, as a <HI>Way of Travelling without Fatigue,</HI> yet you may be sure, My SON, I should have recom∣mended unto you an Acquaintance with HISTO∣RY, as one of the most Needful and Useful Accom∣plishments, for a Man that would serve GOD as you Propose to do. The Praises of that Me∣thod which they that <HI>handle the Pen of the Writer,</HI> have taken to <HI>stop the Flood of things,</HI> and give a <HI>Consistency</HI> and a <HI>Duration</HI> unto them, that <HI>Histori∣ans</HI> usually begin their Works withal, and the Flourishes about, <HI>Lux Veritatis, Vita Memoriae, Ma∣gistra Vitae,</HI> and I know not what, are as unneces∣sary on <HI>this</HI> Occasion, as they are on <HI>that</HI> whereon we commonly have them. And tho' perhaps we cannot meet with such <HI>Historians,</HI> as <HI>Le Moyne</HI> pleases to require, but such as he says, <HI>Will not appear until the Year when the Philosophers Stone shall be discovered;</HI> yet I would not have you discourag∣ed from Reading the <HI>Best we have.</HI> But for this Purpose, I shall be far from advising you to im∣pose on yourself, the tedious Task of Reading o∣ver the Hundreds of <HI>Histories,</HI> which <HI>Degory Whear,</HI> or the Frenchman who has more lately written, <HI>L'Histoire des Histoires,</HI> may obtrude upon you, ex∣cept you were to have the long Life of an <HI>Ante∣diluvian;</HI> and even <HI>then</HI> also, to Read them <HI>all</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="002772_0042_0FE62ECDEA7AB9B0"/>would be to spend much Time impertinently. Pehaps a Concise <HI>Body of Universal History,</HI> may be very properly laid in the Foundation of your <HI>His∣torical Studies.</HI> And tho' <HI>Hornius,</HI> his <HI>Arca Noae,</HI> be Admirable, and <HI>Sleidans</HI> little Book, <HI>De quatuor summis Imperiis,</HI> be far from Despicable; yet I can't presently think of a Better, than <HI>Matthias Prideaux,</HI> his <HI>Easy and Compendious Introduction for the Reading all sorts of Histories.</HI> Proceed then, to some Volumns of larger Dimensions; Among which I can tell of none that I could more hearti∣ly commend unto you, than <HI>Howel,</HI> his <HI>Institution of General History:</HI> And upon this, add, <HI>Pussendorf's Introduction.</HI> But I will here Betimes lay in for this; In Reading of all <HI>History,</HI> ever now and then make a convenient Pause; to think, <HI>What can I see of the Glorious GOD in these Occurrences?</HI> And always remember, <HI>The Providence of the Glori∣ous GOD in governing the World, is now under my Contemplation.</HI></P>
<P>Doubtless you will have a <HI>Desire,</HI> if you can find a <HI>Leisure,</HI> to Read some <HI>Histories</HI> of <HI>Particular Countrys.</HI> And here, as I know none better than <HI>Mezeray,</HI> for <HI>France; Mariana,</HI> for <HI>Spain; Grotius,</HI> for <HI>Holland; Knoles</HI> with <HI>Rycaut,</HI> for the <HI>Ottoman Empire; Ludolphus,</HI> for <HI>Abyssinia; Crull,</HI> for <HI>Russia;</HI> [there are several small <HI>Story-tellers</HI> for <HI>Persia,</HI> and <HI>Indoustan,</HI>] <HI>Martinius,</HI> and some other <HI>Jesuites</HI> [but you must Remember, they are <HI>Jesuites!</HI>] for <HI>China; Martyr,</HI> or <HI>Acosta,</HI> or <HI>Ogilby,</HI> for <HI>America; Bucha∣nan,</HI> for <HI>Scotland;</HI> and <HI>Cox</HI> for <HI>Ireland;</HI> So, I would prefer <HI>Baker,</HI> for <HI>England;</HI> especially, if you could come at an Edition that was printed before what they call, <HI>The Restauration. The Memorials of Eng∣lish
<PB N="60" REF="002772_0043_0FE62ECDF117A468"/>Affairs, from the supposed Expedition of</HI> Brute <HI>into the Island, until the coming of</HI> K. James, I. [Don't something in the Title sound a little <HI>oddly?</HI>] writ∣ten by <HI>Whitlock,</HI> or the little, <HI>Medulla Historiae An∣gelicanae,</HI> may also be to you a pretty Abstract of our <HI>English History.</HI></P>
<P>But the mention of <HI>English Affairs</HI> pushes me, even with some Anticipation, into the Caution which I am to give you, about Reading all our <HI>Common Histories,</HI> but none more than the <HI>English</HI> ones; That is, <HI>To believe with Discretion.</HI> Alas, The <HI>Vanity</HI> which attends Humane Affairs! As there are many Men and Things that are scarce mentioned in <HI>True History,</HI> which deserve a men∣tion more than some that are universally celebrat∣ed; What <HI>Hero</HI>'s are buried among those who liv∣ed before the Days of <HI>Agmemnon?</HI> And <HI>Walter Plettenberg</HI> is less known than a Turkish Pyrate: What has been <HI>ponderous</HI> has (as my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> expresses it) been <HI>sunk</HI> to the Bottom in the Stream of <HI>Time,</HI> while we have <HI>Straw</HI> and <HI>Stubble</HI> swimming a top: So, 'tis a thing, that may be too <HI>truly,</HI> but can't be too <HI>sadly,</HI> complained of; That the Instances wherein <HI>False History</HI> has been imposed upon the World, are what <HI>cannot be num∣bred. Historians</HI> have generally taken after their Father <HI>Herodotus:</HI> And even <HI>One of themselves, Vopiscus</HI> by Name, has expresly said of them, <HI>They are all them Lyars: This Witness is True!</HI> Tho' they have not all of them always been such Mercenary Villains as Bishop <HI>Jovius,</HI> or that scandalous Fel∣low, who more lately so hired himself out as an <HI>History Writer</HI> for the highest Bidder, that his Coun∣trymen, the <HI>Italians,</HI> fixed that Motto on him,
<PB N="61" REF="002772_0043_0FE62ECDF117A468"/><HI>Not according to the History but the Salary;</HI> yet One who <HI>gently</HI> enough Criticises on them, too <HI>Justly</HI> questions, <HI>Whether any Modern Historian</HI> has <HI>thought of any more than pleasing the Prince or Party for which he wrote.</HI> The <HI>Ancient</HI> are not much better than the <HI>Modern;</HI> Whereof we have a notorious and amazing Example in <HI>Josephus.</HI> It would be too long a Digression to relate his <HI>Vile Prevarications;</HI> which have compelled us to concur unto the Cen∣sure passed by our <HI>Gregory</HI> upon him; That being Ambitious to have his Work find Acceptance a∣mong the <HI>Heathen,</HI> he did so compose his <HI>History</HI> as to propose nothing that might appear Incredi∣ble to <HI>them,</HI> and not have some Congruity with what <HI>had been,</HI> and was likely again <HI>to be</HI> among them. Indeed all honest Men are scandalized, no less than <HI>Castrius,</HI> at the Pains he takes to make his Court unto the <HI>Roman Princes</HI> by his <HI>Heathen Judaism;</HI> wherein, as One says, he was more Im∣pious than the <HI>Philistines</HI> who placed the <HI>Ark</HI> by <HI>Dagon.</HI></P>
<P>What a fine Story are we like to have, of as Infamous a Reign as ever was in the World, and a <HI>Tyranny</HI> all made up of Treacheries, and Rob∣berries, and Cruelties that cannot be parallel'd, when it comes from Three Poets, each of them, with a Pension of Twelve Thousand Livres a Year, to give us a <HI>Panegyric</HI> instead of an <HI>History,</HI> and outdo a <HI>Paterculus</HI> blanching his <HI>Tiberius!</HI> How little many Representations of Matters in <HI>Histories</HI> are to be relied upon, methinks, it may be a little illustrated from the <HI>Two chief Command∣ers</HI> in a Memorable Battle of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> both of which, wrote the History of the Battle, without
<PB N="62" REF="002772_0044_0FE62ECFD38D10E0"/>the least mention made by the one of the other each assuming to himself the entire Honour of the Day. You will certainly say, <HI>Who can under∣stand his Errors?</HI> — When the Admirable <HI>Erasmus</HI> himself mistakes one Man for two, in writing of what was a great while ago; and three professed and eminent Historians give us a very wrong Ac∣count of the Gentleman who a much less while ago, founded the <HI>Charter-House,;</HI> and tho' no Writer of History ever were more Meritorious, than the Incomparable <HI>Thuanus,</HI> yet Learned Men have said of his Performance, that it contained, <HI>Multa falsissima et indigna.</HI> Yea, there are <HI>Histori∣ans,</HI> of whom one can scarce tell which to admire most, the <HI>Nature</HI> of their <HI>Lies,</HI> or their <HI>Manner</HI> of telling them; I mean, the <HI>Impudence</HI> with which they tell them. For Instance, it is pretty well, that <HI>Hozier</HI> the French King's Genealogift, has discovered no less than <HI>Four Thousand</HI> wrong Things in <HI>Varillas,</HI> the same King's Historian; And ano∣ther observes, every single Page in him, has almost as many Errors, as a Printers ordinary Table of <HI>Errata.</HI> But then, what an <HI>Impudent</HI> Fellow was <HI>Philanax Anglicus,</HI> when he accused <HI>Calvin</HI> of <HI>De∣licacy,</HI> and <HI>Epicureanism</HI> in his Way of Living; and quotes <HI>Florimond de Remond</HI> for a Witness of it; who, he says, has <HI>left us a lively Image of him.</HI> Whereas, if you consult this <HI>Florimond de Remond,</HI> the <HI>lively Image</HI> which he gives of <HI>Calvin,</HI> is, That <HI>from his Youth he macerated his Body with Fasting, and that hardly could be found a Man that equalled him for his Laboriousness.</HI> Be sure, the <HI>late Historians,</HI> that pretend unto an, <HI>History of England,</HI> for us, write with such flagrant <HI>Partialities,</HI> and are such evident
<PB N="63" REF="002772_0044_0FE62ECFD38D10E0"/><HI>Leasing-makers,</HI> and palm upon you so very wrong and base Exhibitions, especially of <HI>late Occurrences,</HI> that one may as well believe the <HI>True History</HI> of a <HI>Lucian,</HI> as yield any Credit unto them. If you must read them, yet as to things that passed in the former Century, I would hardly so much as look upon many of them. And among These, tho' several are bad enough, yet there is none that has done so Ill as an <HI>Eachard,</HI> (I mean, in his <HI>English,</HI> and not in his <HI>Roman</HI> History,) who should not be admitted into the Library of a Gentleman that has any Concern for <HI>Truth;</HI> except he'll assign him a Place on the same Shelf, with the <HI>Grand Cyrus,</HI> or, <HI>Cleopatra.</HI> A late <HI>Critical History of England,</HI> has done some Justice upon him. In∣deed the <HI>Historians</HI> never keep closer to the <HI>Way of Lying,</HI> than in the Relation they give of those <HI>Twenty Years,</HI> which passed after the Beginning of our <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> and afforded a very ample and fertile Field, for their Faculty to work upon. A∣mong these, the <HI>Romance</HI> that goes under the Ti∣tle of, <HI>The History of the Grand Rebellion,</HI> and is fa∣thered on the Earl of <HI>Charendon,</HI> I would have you more particularly treat with the Disregard that is proper for it. If you would come at all near to the <HI>Truth</HI> of what Concerns those Times, you must look for it, in <HI>Whitlock,</HI> his <HI>Memorials of Eng∣lish Affairs, from the Beginning of</HI> K. Charles I. <HI>to the Restoring</HI> of K. Charles II. And <HI>Rushworth</HI> his <HI>Collections.</HI> And yet even there, some of the greatest Persons and Actions have not always <HI>Full Justice</HI> done them. I do particularly Advertise you, That the <HI>Mighty Man,</HI> whom not only our King <HI>William</HI> (as <HI>Fleming</HI> reports) had a very
<PB N="64" REF="002772_0045_0FE62ECFD9F01F18"/>high Esteem for, but also his most bigotted and bitterest Enemies confess to have been a <HI>Matchless Hero,</HI> and (as even Sr. <HI>Roger Manly</HI> himself, as well as many more of his Bran, acknowledges) <HI>Not unworthy of the Supreme Heighth of Empire which he attain'd to,</HI> has never yet had his <HI>History</HI> fairly and fully given; and when you read it given (as they are now <HI>Approaching towards it</HI>) with the greatest <HI>Impartiality</HI> wherein you have hitherto seen it, you may bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is in your Mind, that the <HI>Principal Stroke</HI> in his Character, and the <HI>Principal Spring</HI> of his Con∣duct, is forever <HI>defectively</HI> Related.</P>
<P>As for such Abominable Pens, as what the <HI>A∣thenae Oxonienses</HI> of a <HI>Wood</HI> have been Excretions from, you cannot sufficiently Despise them &amp; Abhor them. And I will further tell you, That if in a∣ny <HI>History,</HI> you happen to find any Vindicating or Favourable Passages of old A Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> Let these be <HI>Shibboleth</HI> enough with you, to do the Office which the <HI>Rattle</HI> does for the <HI>Serpent,</HI> which our Country is no Stranger to. Yea, and when you Read, even such <HI>Consciencious Historians,</HI> as a <HI>Baxter,</HI> and a <HI>Burnet,</HI> you must make Allowances for some <HI>Hearsays,</HI> which led them into <HI>Mistakes;</HI> and for certain <HI>Prejudices,</HI> the Tincture whereof a little influenced their <HI>Views</HI> of what they were disaffected to.</P>
<P>Having thus armed you, for a Walk among the <HI>Woods</HI> of <HI>Civil History,</HI> I must now propose CHURCH-HISTORY, with a yet more <HI>earnest Wish,</HI> to have you well-acquainted with it. For, altho' <HI>Grotius</HI> observes, <HI>Qui legit Historiam Ecclesi∣asticam, quid legit, nisi Episcoporum Vitia?</HI> And o∣thers have been so Satyrical as to say, <HI>Ecclesiastical
<PB N="65" REF="002772_0045_0FE62ECFD9F01F18"/>History is nothing but many large Volumns, containing some few of the Squabbles of the Bishops, and Inferiour Clergy, with One another, and all the World.</HI> Never∣theless a Divine has a <HI>Blemish</HI> upon him, almost as Disqualifying as any of the <HI>Hundred and Forty</HI> which the Jews reckon to bring a <HI>Priest</HI> of theirs under Incapacities, if <HI>Church-History</HI> has not in∣structed him for the Business of the <HI>Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>Now, for a Regular System of <HI>Church-History,</HI> I know not that I can tender you a Better, than <HI>Spanheim,</HI> his <HI>Introductio ad Historiam et Antiquitates Sacras;</HI> To which, by all means add, <HI>Hornius,</HI> his <HI>Historia Ecclesiastica:</HI> And <HI>Usher,</HI> his, <HI>De Christiana∣rum Ecclesrarum Successione et Statu.</HI> If you would have what is <HI>English,</HI> and <HI>Easy,</HI> 'tis done to your Hand by a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Patrick Symp∣son,</HI> in his <HI>History of the Church.</HI> Somewhat larger than these, and never enough to be commended, is, <HI>Hottinger,</HI> his, <HI>Historia Ecclesiastica Novi Testa∣menti</HI> But then, I would have you, if you don't wholly <HI>Peruse,</HI> yet by all means <HI>Possess,</HI> and often <HI>Visit,</HI> the <HI>Ecclesiastical History</HI> of the <HI>Magdeburgensian Centuriators;</HI> Of which noble Work I will say, what <HI>Spanheim</HI> said before me; That it is, <HI>Biblio∣theca totius Christianae Antiquitatis. — incredibili cum Studio, Fide optima, Meth do utilissima, cong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sta.</HI></P>
<P>There have been also more <HI>particular Essays</HI> of <HI>Church History,</HI> which you may do well to find some time for Conversation with. Such more especially are what we have had from <HI>Eusebius,</HI> whom they call <HI>The Father of Church History;</HI> Together with, <HI>The Tripartite History,</HI> of <HI>Socrates,</HI> and <HI>Theodoret,</HI> and <HI>Sozomen,</HI> continued by <HI>Evagri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI>

<P>But <HI>Cicero</HI> is not the only Gentleman, who has been able to say, That in <HI>History</HI> they have espe∣cially studied the <HI>Pourtraiture of Wise Men, who have been before them, to imprint on themselves as far as might be, the Resemblance of them.</HI> I hope <HI>you</HI> will do so too; and read the <HI>Lives,</HI> especially of them <HI>who have done worthily in Israel:</HI> Not only on the Intention of rendring Praises to the Glorious GOD, who did such Things as you will see done <HI>For</HI> and <HI>By</HI> these notable Men, but also Intending in as many Points as may be, to <HI>Go and Do likewise.</HI> Be sure, that whatever you see <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Bright,</HI> in any Excellent Person, whose <HI>Life</HI> you have in your Hands, you <HI>look off</HI> to the Glo∣rious JESUS, as having in HIM all these Excel∣lencies after a Transcendent Manner, and as being the Author and Giver of them to the <HI>Distin∣guished Gloworm.</HI> And when you read of any imi∣table PIETY in any of them, think with your self; <HI>The Virtues of this Man, were first i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the JE∣SUS that called him into this marvellous Light, and from him it was derived unto this Believer.

And if you go into <HI>Cave,</HI> his, <HI>Lives of the Fathers,</HI> you will be well entertained there. The

In <HI>Witten,</HI> his <HI>Memoriae Renovatae,</HI> you may ever now and then find an Oration, which an Hour will not be unprofitably thrown away, that shall be afforded to. Indeed, <HI>Frehe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> his <HI>Thea∣trum,</HI> has in it such an <HI>Abbreviation of Lives,</HI> that his <HI>Pictures</HI> will give you almost as much Pleasure as his <HI>Accounts,</HI> of them that have been <HI>Men of Renown in the Congregation</HI> of the learned: Yet I can tell you of <HI>Theatres</HI> much less worthy to be gone unto. And tho' there hardly ever was a more Dull &amp; <HI>Lifeless</HI> Transcriber than our <HI>S.

Of the many <HI>Lives</HI> that have been published since those Col∣lections, there are so many, which you won't be either <HI>Weary</HI> or the <HI>Worse,</HI> for casting your Eye upon, that if I should go to tell you <HI>which,</HI> I shall tire you with too long a Catalogue. If I should enter upon it, I hope, I should steer clear, of <HI>Bel∣larmine</HI>'s Disingenuity, for which our <HI>Prideaux</HI> well taxes him, who in his Book, <HI>Of Ecclesiastical Wri∣ters,</HI> has not the Honesty to Name one of our Side; But I would encourage you to read the Life of a <HI>William Burkitt,</HI> as well as of a <HI>Philip Henry;</HI> and what you have in <HI>Fuller,</HI> his <HI>Worthies

But <HI>now,</HI> I have Rea∣son more than ever to say, Let that <HI>History</HI> be taken in among those, that (particularly for <HI>Vari∣ety</HI>) may have some Consideration with you.</P>
<P>In fine: 'Tis possible you may find a <HI>Church-History,</HI> wherein the Lives of Good Men may be the most significant Ingredients of the Composition. If you do, I wish you the Satisfaction of <HI>Time well spent</HI> in such harmless Company.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add, but that you must have the <HI>Clock of Time</HI> set right with you, by CHRO∣NOLOGY, if you would be an Understanding Traveller in <HI>History.</HI> For the <HI>Chronology</HI> of the Bible, I can refer you to none so well as to a <HI>Whiston,</HI> whose Decisive Searches do supersede all the Trouble of repairing to those who have writ before him. And for the <HI>Chronology</HI> of all Ages, our <HI>Tallents</HI> has by his <HI>Tables</HI> prepared such a <HI>Feast</HI> for you, that you will have little Need of repair∣ing to any other <HI>Quarter.</HI> An <HI>Usher,</HI> a <HI>Calvisius,</HI> a <HI>Baily,</HI> will enrich your Library; and it may be worth your while to have them at hand upon Oc∣casion. But for a <HI>Daily Recourse,</HI> you can have nothing at hand more Expeditious, or more Com∣prehensive, than the <HI>Thesaurus Chronologiae</HI> of the Gentleman, whose Name was very truly Anagram∣matized
<PB N="70" REF="002772_0048_0FE62EE19F05A680"/>into <HI>Sedulitas;</HI> in which Quality I wish you may make a <HI>Pattern</HI> of him.</P>
<P>That your Library may be furnished with a <HI>Magazine of History,</HI> to which you may continually go for every thing that your Mind may lead you to, the, <HI>Theatrum Humanae Vitae,</HI> of a <HI>Zuinger,</HI> in the last and large Edition, is one of the Best that I can advise you to. For <HI>Occasional Readings,</HI> you may do well to divert yourself with <HI>Camerarius</HI> his <HI>Horae Subcesivae;</HI> with <HI>Prideaux,</HI> his <HI>Connection;</HI> and with such Things as <HI>Wanly,</HI> his <HI>History of Man;</HI> and <HI>Cambdens Remains.</HI> I would have added, a <HI>Montfaucon</HI> his <HI>Antiquities Explained,</HI> if I could have told you, how to come at so costly a Col∣lection. But I may add, <HI>Lewis</HI>'s <HI>Hebrew, Ken∣net</HI>'s <HI>Roman,</HI> and <HI>Potter</HI>'s <HI>Greek Antiquities</HI> as wor∣thy your Having and Reading.</P>
<P>But for a yet more <HI>Immense Treasure</HI> of <HI>History</HI> and of all that belongs unto it, <HI>Hofman</HI> has a <HI>Lex∣icon</HI> for you in Four stately <HI>Folio</HI>'s, which alone may be called, <HI>A Library.</HI> The <HI>Great Historical Dictionary</HI> now appearing in English, has been growing from <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Time, thro' the Hands of <HI>Loyd,</HI> and <HI>Moreri,</HI> and others, till at last, an odd Man by hurting and mangling of it, and making some <HI>Additions</HI> (whereof many are none of the best,) unto it, has obtained that it must go un∣der the Name of <HI>Collier:</HI> A Fate quite the Re∣verse of what has befallen <HI>Calepine.</HI> It should with all its Faults be in your Library; But then, The <HI>Critical History</HI> of <HI>Bayle,</HI> if you can be enriched with it, will not only correct many of the Faults in that, but also be for you almost another <HI>Library.</HI> 'Tis a Work to be wondred at! Only guard a∣gainst

<P>And here it may be a proper Time for me to say; When you see such astonishing Effects of <HI>Erudition</HI> and <HI>Application,</HI> produced from the Sons of Men, as you will find in some that <HI>have been</HI> (and others that <HI>might be</HI>) mentioned, Let the Sight still produce from you some due <HI>Acknow∣ledgements</HI> of the Glorious GOD; <HI>My GOD, I a∣dore thy Power, thy Wisdom, thy Goodness, Conspicuous in these Wonderful Performances!</HI></P>
<P>But for the Close of all, I will give you this One Hint of a more general Importance. There are Books, which for the Grateful <HI>Stores of Learn∣ing</HI> amass'd in them, I can't but wish, that you would in the <HI>Parentheses</HI> of your Studies, often repair unto. Those which among these, I would more particularly single out for a Recommendation to you, are, the, <HI>De Veritate Religionis Christianae,</HI> of a <HI>Grotius:</HI> The <HI>Demonstratio Evangelica,</HI> of a <HI>Huetius;</HI> The <HI>Theologoumena,</HI> of an <HI>Owen;</HI> Every Thing of an admirable <HI>Hospinian;</HI> or <HI>Heidegger;</HI> The <HI>Apolo∣gy</HI> of an <HI>Hakewel;</HI> The <HI>Miscellanea,</HI> and <HI>Meletemata,</HI> of a <HI>Witsius; Parker</HI> on, <HI>The Cross: Basnage</HI> his History of the <HI>Jews:</HI> Adding, the <HI>Origines Sacrae</HI> of a <HI>Stillingfleet;</HI> the <HI>Court of the Gentiles,</HI> of a <HI>Gale;</HI> and the, <HI>Antiquitates Biblicae,</HI> of a <HI>Diete∣nious.</HI></P>
<P>§. 12. Even while you are yet in your <HI>Early <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth,</HI> and but in your Course towards the <HI>Fair Havens</HI> of <HI>Theology,</HI> at which I am now quickly to Land you, I would advise to Two Things,
<PB N="72" REF="002772_0049_0FE62EE1A3A3CF50"/>whereof you will certainly find an inexpressible and almost incredible Advantage.</P>
<P>One Thing that I advise you to, is This. Keep your QUOTIDIANA. I mean Have your <HI>Blank Books,</HI> in which <HI>Note</HI> with your Pen, for the most Part <HI>Every Day,</HI> [Let there be, <HI>Nulla Dies sine Li∣nea!</HI>] Some <HI>Notable Thing,</HI> which in Reading you have newly met withal. By this Action you will <HI>fix</HI> the <HI>Valuable Notion</HI> in your Mind: And in a few Years, you will have a <HI>Treasure,</HI> from whence as a <HI>Scribe instructed for the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> you may <HI>bring out Things New and Old,</HI> and have agree∣able <HI>Grains of Salt</HI> for all your Discourses. You will not for this, Use the <HI>Unequal Way,</HI> of entring the Riches, of your <HI>Quotidiana,</HI> in Pages with the <HI>Titles of a Common-Place</HI> at the Tops of them, whereof some will be soon <HI>Crammed,</HI> and others remain <HI>Empty,</HI> perhaps all your Days: But, <HI>Enter the Things as they come,</HI> with only affixing the <HI>Num∣ber</HI> to them: And have, at the End of the Books an <HI>Alphabetical Index,</HI> of the <HI>Matter,</HI> with the <HI>Num∣ber</HI> at which it is to be met withal. Here you will anon have an inexhaustible <HI>Magazine;</HI> and if you live to <HI>Old Age,</HI> you will find, that, like Old <HI>Photius,</HI> you have prepared an <HI>Hive</HI> then to live upon. I will not say, you will be quickly as rich as <HI>Craesus;</HI> for poor <HI>Craesus</HI> will have no Riches comparable to what you will have in your Col∣lections.</P>
<P>Another Thing that I advise you to, is This. Form a SODALITY. What I mean, is, Prevail with a Fit Number, [<HI>Six</HI> or <HI>Seven</HI> may be a Com∣petency, or Fewer, if you can't find so many,] of Sober, Ingenious, and Industrious Young Men,
<PB N="73" REF="002772_0049_0FE62EE1A3A3CF50"/>to Associate with you, and meet <HI>One Evening</HI> in a <HI>Week,</HI> for the spending of Two or Three Hours, in a <HI>Profitable Conversation.</HI> At this Interview, Let there be always a sort of <HI>Director,</HI> who shall pro∣pose this Question, (and see, that without need∣less Digressions and Excursions it be <HI>kept close</HI> un∣to,) <HI>What Remarkable and Memorable Matter has occurr'd in late Studies, that is thought now to be of∣fered?</HI> Let the Question be Articulated, and more particularly and successively turn upon these Ar∣ticles. I. What in <HI>Philology?</HI> II. What in <HI>Phi∣losophy?</HI> III. What in <HI>Geography,</HI> and the rest of the <HI>M thematicks?</HI> IV. What in <HI>History?</HI> V. What in <HI>Illustrations</HI> of the <HI>Sacred Scriptures;</HI> Or, <HI>Biblical Curiosities?</HI> Let each Person, in what Order they shall agree upon, give his Report as <HI>Concisely</HI> as may be. But it will not be expected, that each Person should be prepared, at <HI>every Time,</HI> with something on <HI>every Head:</HI> It is enough, that he bring in, for that <HI>Cell,</HI> which he happens to be best furnished for. All <HI>Altercations,</HI> and all <HI>Imper∣tinencies,</HI> are to be forever banished from those <HI>Communications</HI> of the <HI>Sodality.</HI> But how much could I wish, that you could gain one Quarter of an Hour in the close of all, to relate, <HI>What rare Flight or fine Stroke of the</HI> Christian Asceticks, <HI>has been met withal; and what for the Animation of Prac∣tical PIETY?</HI> Behold, a way to clench the <HI>Nails</HI> that have been struck into your Minds; and a Compendious and Charitable Course to come at the <HI>Wealth,</HI> which the <HI>Diligence</HI> of your Brethren has made them the Owners of; together with the <HI>generous Pleasure</HI> of making them the Partakers of yours. 'Twill have a Tendency also to quali∣fy
<PB N="74" REF="002772_0050_0FE62EECDB5596D0"/>you for <HI>Useful Conference</HI> in <HI>other Company;</HI> and make you a <HI>Speaker,</HI> whose <HI>Words</HI> may always be as the <HI>Choicest Silver,</HI> and as <HI>Fruits</HI> from the <HI>Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Life</HI> to such as you Converse withal. It was a Remark that <HI>Plato</HI> made a good while ago; <HI>That the true Manner of Teaching Sciences, is by Con∣versation.</HI> And, <HI>We never well understand a Truth, if we are not in a Condition on all Occasions to make it known unto such as are for the receiving of it.</HI></P>
<P>Because of its being somewhat <HI>Akin</HI> to <HI>This,</HI> and because we are just now entring upon the Study of DIVINITY, I will, tho' there may seem almost some <HI>Anticipation</HI> in it, here Transcribe a Passage from the PATERNA, of One whom it may be, you are not wholly a Stranger to; and who was himself but a very <HI>Young Man,</HI> when he was engaged in the Projection referr'd unto.</P>
<P><Q>I singled out a Number of <HI>Students,</HI> who had passed thro' their <HI>Cursus,</HI> in Philosophical and Academical Studies, and were just entring into the World. These Young Gentlemen met once a Week at my Study; where we carried on a Course of <HI>Disputation</HI> upon the Body of <HI>Divinity.</HI> In the several <HI>Common Place</HI> Heads of <HI>Divinity,</HI> where any notable <HI>Controversy</HI> had been manag∣ed in the Church of GOD, we had a <HI>Solemn Disputation</HI> on the <HI>Controverted Question.</HI> In this <HI>Disputation,</HI> I was always the <HI>Moderator,</HI> and still concluded with a Discourse, which by Argu∣ment established the <HI>Truth,</HI> defended by the <HI>Respondent.</HI> But, because upon every <HI>Head</HI> of <HI>Divinity</HI> there were Multitudes of <HI>Questions,</HI> not so worthy of a Solemn <HI>Disputation, These</HI> I labo∣riously gathered up, and giving them to the
<PB N="75" REF="002772_0050_0FE62EECDB5596D0"/><HI>Society,</HI> at some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Meetings, we came all pre∣pared, with <HI>Brief,</HI> but <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>Proved</HI> Answers to them; which we accordingly delivered in our Order. The <HI>Benefit</HI> of these Exercises, we found Unspeakable!</Q></P>
<P>§. 13. All this while I have been proposing to bring you on towards the <HI>Evangelical Ministry,</HI> and the Study of THEOLOGY for it and in it, after such a Manner, as to render you a <HI>Skilful Artist</HI> for the Work of your GOD.</P>
<P>Now, Surely it is not at all Congruous to Study <HI>Divinity</HI> upon any other than <HI>Divine</HI> Principles: But when you are in the Approaches of THEO∣LOGY, more particularly fixing your Purpose, to be [<HI>If the Lord will!</HI>] a MINISTER of the Gospel, it is necessary, that since you <HI>Desire a Good Work,</HI> it may be upon a <HI>Good End</HI> that you do it. Let such Noble Considerations as these, have their Influence upon you.</P>
<Q><P>A WORK I have now before me, wherein I am to be perpetually rendring <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> to the Glorious GOD, in <HI>Enquiries</HI> for, and <HI>Con∣fessions</HI> of, the <HI>Truths,</HI> of His Holy Religion; and procuring <HI>Acknowledgements</HI> to Him from others, by acquainting them with such <HI>Truths,</HI> and perswading them to that PIETY, which they are thereby to be led unto.</P>
<P>A WORK, whereof the Main and the Next Intention is, To restore the <HI>Throne of GOD</HI> in the Soul of Man, and bring the Sons of <HI>Death,</HI> into the <HI>Life of GOD,</HI> and into those Methods of PIETY, wherein they will <HI>Glorify GOD and Enjoy Him forever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="002772_0051_0FE62F5BA44DDE78"/>
A WORK, whereof the <HI>Grand Aim</HI> is to ex∣hibit the <HI>Glories</HI> of a Lovely REDEEMER, of whom, <HI>How Great is the Goodness and the Beauty!</HI> And fill up His <HI>Mystical Body</HI> by bringing in to Him, those whom His FATHER has given to Him; and whose coming under the <HI>Shadow of His Wings,</HI> was the <HI>Joy set before Him,</HI> to Com∣fort Him in His <HI>Travailing Agonies.</HI></P>
<P>A WORK, which is to <HI>turn</HI> the Children of Men <HI>from Darkness unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD,</HI> and Instruct, and Assist, and Animate the Children of GOD, in <HI>Chusing,</HI> and in <HI>Doing,</HI> the <HI>Things that please Him,</HI> and Raise <HI>Living Temples</HI> for GOD, and fill them with His <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, A WORK, which, if done with all <HI>Good Fidelity</HI> will in a <HI>Future State</HI> be followed with astonishing Recompences. — <HI>Thy Work shall be Rewarded, faith the Lord!</HI></P></Q>
<P>Unto this WORK, as a <HI>Work</HI> that indeed car∣ries its own <HI>Wages</HI> in it, and a <HI>Work</HI> which on these Illustrious Accounts, no other Calling may be compared unto, you will now bring yourself under a most Solemn DEDICATION. With an Heart marvellously set upon this <HI>Work</HI> of GOD, Humbly thus Declare unto Him. <HI>Glorious GOD, Owning myself utterly unworthy of such a Favour, I desire to Devote myself unto the Service of my SAVI∣OUR; and I entreat of Thee graciously to Accept of me. Sensible that I can do nothing, I Resign myself up unto thy Holy SPIRIT, O my GOD, and my SAVIOUR, that He may Possess me, and Furnish me, and Quicken me for Thy Service; and carry me thro' all that I may be called unto. And since all Opportunities to Serve
<PB N="77" REF="002772_0051_0FE62F5BA44DDE78"/>Thy Kingdom in the World are entirely at thy Dispose, I Rely upon thy Providence to find out Opportunitios for my doing of Good; Resolving with thy Help, to be sa∣tisfied with what I shall see the Thing appointed for me.</HI></P>
<P>Being brought under such a <HI>Consecration</HI> to GOD, <HI>Now</HI> proceed in your <HI>Preparation</HI> for the Service o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Sanctuary. In which, as you pass along, I cannot but wish, that the Admirable <HI>Wit∣sius,</HI> his Oration, <HI>De Vero Theologo,</HI> might be so con∣siderately Read by you, as to leave a deep Im∣pression upon you.</P>
<P>It is a Speech of <HI>Jacob Alting,</HI> with which I am Willing your Mind should be deeply tinctured; <HI>Majus est in Ecclesia aliquid dixisse, quod ad ejus Edi∣ficationim pertineat, quam summa inter Homines Gloria, et Potestate gavisum fuisse.</HI> And I will hereupon mind you of it, That One of the greatest Perso∣nages (an Archbishop and a Lord-keeper) in the English Nation once uttered this Memorable Speech; <HI>I have passed thro' many Places of Honour and Trust, both in Church and State, more than any of my Order in</HI> England, <HI>for Seventy Years before. But were I assured, that by my Preaching I had Converted but one Soul unto GOD, I should herein take more Com∣fort, than in all the Honours and Offices that have ever been bestowed upon me.</HI> You are entring upon a <HI>Work,</HI> that will keep you continually in the Way of this <HI>Incomparable Satisfaction;</HI> And, I hope, that you will <HI>Rejoyce in the Way</HI> of bearing <HI>Testimonies</HI> for GOD, <HI>more than in all Riches;</HI> and that the <HI>Saving,</HI> or Enlightening and Edifying of One Soul at any Time, will be a Matter of more <HI>Joy</HI> unto you, than if all the <HI>Wealth</HI> of <HI>Ophir</HI> should
<PB N="78" REF="002772_0052_0FE62EEF2A0460D0"/>flow in upon you. If such Men of Quality, as <HI>George</HI> the Prince of <HI>Anhal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Chan∣dieu</HI> who goes under the Hebrew Name of <HI>Sadeel,</HI> and the Noble <HI>John Alasco,</HI> (to say nothing of <HI>Titus,</HI> to whom they assign a Noble Extraction among the <HI>Cretians,</HI>) counted themselves gloriously <HI>Enriched</HI> in <HI>Opportunities</HI> to <HI>Preach the Unsearchable Riches of CHRIST;</HI> Yea, Or if the most Opulent Monarch that ever <HI>Israel</HI> had, even <HI>Solomon in all his Glory,</HI> has assumed the Title of, <HI>The Preacher;</HI> It was no Diminution unto their Quality, to be employed in a Work of this Importance. I will not say, You are <HI>taken in among the great Men of Achaia,</HI> but more than so, <HI>GOD raises the Poor out of the Dust, and sets you with the Princes of His People,</HI> when He thus employs you. It pleases me, when I read such a Passage as this drop from the Pen of, a <HI>Person of Quality,</HI> in his, <HI>View of the Soul.</HI> <Q>It is certainly, the <HI>Highest Dignity,</HI> if not the <HI>Great∣est Happiness,</HI> that Humane Nature is capable of, here in this Vale below, to have the Soul so far enlightened, as to become the Mirrour, or Con∣duit, or Conveyer of GOD's <HI>Truth</HI> to others.</Q></P>
<P>But then, <HI>Be Arm'd! Be Arm'd,</HI> as a <HI>Good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST,</HI> for an Employment, wherein Grievcus Discouragements, Heavy Difficulties, more than can be Numbred, are to be looked for; and Things to be <HI>endured,</HI> whereof 'tis well for you that you may say, <HI>I know not the Things that shall befal me!</HI></P>
<P>Be <HI>Armed,</HI> for a <HI>Warfare,</HI> wherein you will have <HI>Wonderful Temptations</HI> assaulting of you, re∣peated on you. I need not quote an <HI>Ecclesiasticus,</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="002772_0052_0FE62EEF2A0460D0"/>to tell you so. What Low, and Mean, and <HI>Streight</HI> Circumstances for this World, must you probably be confined unto? What Mischiess from the Un∣godly and Unrighteous Men that fill this World, will your Appearances for the <HI>Cause of GOD,</HI> pro∣bably bring upon you? In short, you will find yourself entred into a <HI>Wine-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> and I must give you <HI>Austin</HI>'s Advice, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>repara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad Pressuras:</HI> But let every One of your <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressures</HI> fetch <HI>Good Liquor</HI> from you. Yea, I will <HI>Fore-warn</HI> you of it, That if you move at all out of the Common Road with singular Activities, I believe, you will hardly ever be engaged in any <HI>special Service</HI> for the Kingdom of GOD, but you shall either just before it, or after it, meet with some <HI>special Trouble;</HI> Either in some shock upon your <HI>Health;</HI> Or, in some Storm of Groundless and Senseless <HI>Obloquies</HI> among the People; Or, (which is often, <HI>the Worst of all,</HI>) some horrid <HI>Colaphisations</HI> from the <HI>Wicked Spirits</HI> on your Mind, strangely filling you with <HI>Conster∣nations,</HI> and <HI>Confusions,</HI> which be they never so <HI>un∣reasonable,</HI> yet will be <HI>Intolerable.</HI> There may be some <HI>special Reven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Satan in these Molestations upon you, for the <HI>special Service</HI> to CHRIST, at which he is enrag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; But there is the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of our Faithful REDEEMER for <HI>Holy Ends</HI> permit∣ing and ordering of them; Especially to keep you in the Dust, &amp; in the midst of continual <HI>Anni∣bilations,</HI> that the <HI>Strength</HI> of your Glorious Lord, may be Conspicuous in the <HI>Weakness</HI> which you find yourself reduced unto. But now, in the <HI>Fore∣sight</HI> of all this, can you bravely Resolve; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Tho' I foresee that I shall be exposed unto many Things as uneasy as many Deaths, if I go on to
<PB N="80" REF="002772_0053_0FE62EEF3074B960"/>lay myself out for the Service of thy Kingdom, yet with thy Help, I will go on; I will do it unto the Uttermost. And I will cheerfully Rely upon Thee, to make me a Conqueror, and more than a Conqueror, over all. I Be∣lieve and I am sure, that the Issue will be Glorious!</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Son,</HI> The <HI>Spirit of Martyrdom</HI> is upon thee: Thou shalt be <HI>crowned</HI> among the <HI>Martyrs</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>§. 14. Can a Man be a Thorough <HI>Divine</HI> with∣out <HI>Reading</HI> the SACRED SCRIPTURES? No, Verily; Not so much as a Common <HI>Christian. Read</HI> them, <HI>Child;</HI> I say, <HI>Read</HI> them, with an Uncommon Assiduity. To <HI>Dig</HI> in these Rich Mines, make it your <HI>Daily Exercise.</HI> Hold on doing so, until you are, I will not say, <HI>Bonus Tex∣tuarius,</HI> but until you are, <HI>An Eloquent Man, and Mighty in the Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>To this Purpose, My Advice to you is, That it be your Practice, to <HI>Read</HI> the <HI>Sacred Scriptures</HI> in the <HI>Porismatic Way;</HI> Or, with a Labour to ob∣serve and educe, the <HI>Doctrines of Godliness,</HI> which this inexhaustible <HI>Store-House of Truth,</HI> will yield unto them that are seeking after it. Make a <HI>Pause</HI> upon every <HI>Verse,</HI> and see what <HI>Lessons of Piety</HI> are to be learnt from every <HI>Clause.</HI> Turn the <HI>Lessons</HI> into <HI>Prayers,</HI> and send up the <HI>Prayers</HI> unto the GOD, who is now Teaching of you: <HI>As Arrows from the Hand of a mighty Man,</HI> send them up with Lively <HI>Ejaculations</HI> unto the Heavens. What Ex∣ercise can be more Enlightening, more Sanctify∣ing, more Comfortable, than such an <HI>Intercourse,</HI> of GOD uttering His <HI>Voice,</HI> and, <HI>Lo, a mighty Voice!</HI> — unto you, and your Holy Returning of it, unto Him, in such <HI>Echo's of Devotion!</HI> I will
<PB N="81" REF="002772_0053_0FE62EEF3074B960"/>say this for your Encouragement. In your <HI>Search∣ing of the Scriptures,</HI> you will forever have <HI>some∣thing that is New</HI> to entertain you. They are a <HI>Treasury,</HI> which (beyond that at <HI>Venice</HI>) you can∣not reach to the <HI>Bottom</HI> of. <HI>Austin</HI> in his Epistle to <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lusius</HI> has not said a Thousandth Part of what may be said, about fetching still every Day <HI>fresh Entertainments</HI> and Advantages from them, after one has already Spent an Age in the Study of them. The Jews have <HI>Reason</HI> on their Side, when they say of the Scripture, <HI>Versa eam, et Versa eam, nam onmia sunt in ea.</HI></P>
<P>I will Refine yet a little further upon this <HI>Pro∣posal;</HI> And, <HI>I will shew you an Excellent Way,</HI> how in <HI>Reading</HI> of the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> you may make an Admirable and Effectual Application of the <HI>Leaves,</HI> which are <HI>for the Healing of the Nations;</HI> and have the inestimable Blessings of, <HI>An Healed S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul,</HI> conveyed unto you What I intend is my <HI>Speners</HI> Direction: <HI>Praemissis Plis Precibus, Affectum Scriptorum Sacrorum Devota Attentione observent, eumque Affectum assumere studeant.</HI> The <HI>Holy Men of GOD</HI> who wrote this astonishing BOOK, were <HI>moved by His Holy Spirit,</HI> in it, and for it; and the <HI>Spirit of Holiness</HI> at the Time of the Inspirati∣on made suitable <HI>Impressions</HI> on the <HI>Affections</HI> of His Faithful Servants. When the Holy SPIRIT with His <HI>Afflations,</HI> disposed them to write what we have in our Hands, He doubtless produced in their <HI>Hearts,</HI> those <HI>Motions of PIETY,</HI> which were agreeable and answerable to the <HI>Matter</HI> then flow∣ing from their Pens: They are very <HI>Legible,</HI> and an <HI>ordinary Capacity</HI> may discover them These <HI>Motions of PIETY,</HI> in the Soul; — <HI>By these Things
<PB N="82" REF="002772_0054_0FE62EFCC43CE278"/>Men live, and in all these Things is the Life of your Spirit.</HI> Now, Do you lay One Sentence, and then Another, and so a Third, of your <HI>Pible</HI> be∣fore you. Find out, which of these <HI>Affections</HI> is Obvious and Evident, in the <HI>Sentence</HI> under Con∣sideration. Try, Strive, Do your Best, that the same <HI>Affections</HI> may Stir, yea, Flame in your Soul. Be Restless, till you find your Soul Harmonizing and Symphonizing, with what the Holy SPIRIT of GOD raised in His <HI>Amannensis</HI> at the time of His Writing. Be not at Rest, until you find your <HI>Heart-strings quaver</HI> at the <HI>Touch</HI> upon the Heart of the Writer, as being brought into an <HI>Unison</HI> with it, and the <HI>Two Souls</HI> go up in a Flame to∣gether. Consider what <HI>Affections</HI> of PIETY are plainly discernible in the <HI>Word</HI> that is before you; and then, with a Soul turning unto the Lord, assay to utter the Language of the like <HI>Affections.</HI> E're you are aware, you will be <HI>caught up to Pa∣radise;</HI> you will <HI>mount up as with the Wings of Ea∣gles!</HI> I have had Opportunity elsewhere to say, <Q>If I <HI>constantly affirm</HI> this, That all the Commen∣tators in the World, are poor Things to interpret the Bible, in Comparison of an <HI>Illiterate Christi∣an,</HI> thus coming with a sanctified Soul, to make his <HI>Practical Commentary;</HI> I could quote a very great Person, who will not leave me alone, but will affirm, <HI>Commentarius sine hoc Adminiculo (pio Sacrorum Motuum scrutinio) Conscriptus, est Vere</HI> Commentarius, <HI>et Nomine, et Omine talis, id est,</HI> Commentis cerebri <HI>refertus.</HI> Among all the <HI>Hermeneutic Instruments</HI> for the opening of the Scriptures, We may say of This; <HI>There is none like it.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="002772_0054_0FE62EFCC43CE278"/>
The <HI>Commentaries</HI> of our <HI>Henry</HI> on the Bible, have out-done most that we have yet had, in this Regard: The SPIRIT which dictated the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> operating on the Mind of the Commen∣tator, in the Dispositions and Observations of <HI>Ex∣perimental Piety.</HI> The <HI>Erudition</HI> also appearing, without Affectation of <HI>Appearance,</HI> in them, is far from Contemptible. I wish you furnished with them. What is done by <HI>Pool</HI> and his Continua∣tors, is highly Valuable; and may be of Use, not only for <HI>Occasional Inspection,</HI> but also for <HI>Diurnal Meditation.</HI> How Happy should we have been, if an <HI>Hutcheson</HI> who has done so well on <HI>Job,</HI> and on the <HI>Smaller Prophets,</HI> and on <HI>John,</HI> had left us the like Operations on the rest of the Bible? Or, if a <HI>Caryl</HI> on <HI>Job,</HI> a <HI>Greenhil</HI> on <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> a <HI>Bur∣roughs</HI> on <HI>Hosea,</HI> an <HI>Owen</HI> on the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> a <HI>Man∣ton</HI> on <HI>James,</HI> and a <HI>Jenkins</HI> on <HI>Jude,</HI> were ac∣companied with others like them on the rest of Sacred <HI>Pandects?</HI></P>
<P>Being upon your <HI>Daily Exercise,</HI> I will add no more; But this I would advise you, Wherever you in <HI>any Reading</HI> meet with a curious <HI>Illustration</HI> of a Text, Prize it, Sieze it, Enter it in Papers where you may design a Lodging for such inesti∣mable Jewels. Like <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> have your <HI>Treasures for Precious Stones:</HI> And let these be such unto you. Get such an Amassment of them, that a∣mong them you may be like the King of <HI>Tyrus;</HI> and <HI>Walk up and down in the midst of the Stones of Fire,</HI> when you are upon the <HI>Holy Mountain of GOD.</HI> One of these may be worth an <HI>Ingot of Gold,</HI> and a whole Discourse may be rendred Ac∣ceptable, by having such a <HI>Jewel</HI> studded in it.</P>

§. 15.

<P>And here, Either a <HI>Wollebius,</HI> his, <HI>Manuductio ad Theologiam,</HI> or, an <HI>Amesius</HI> his, <HI>Medulla Theologiae,</HI> or, a <HI>Marckius,</HI> his, <HI>Compendium Theologiae;</HI> I would have you to get so into your <HI>Head</HI> [and, <HI>Heart!</HI>] as to be a perfect <HI>Master of the System.</HI></P>
<P>Go on then, to Read with a strong Attention, the, <HI>Synopsis Purioris Theologiae,</HI> of the <HI>Leyden</HI> Di∣vines. <HI>Usher</HI>'s <HI>Body of Divinity</HI> is Orthodox and Excellent; and is accommodated with the most agreeable Texts of <HI>Sacred Scripture</HI> upon every Article.

He has been called, <HI>Theologus Scripturarius,</HI> and every thing of <HI>his</HI> is Va∣luable: All that is done by that <HI>Hund,</HI> has much of <HI>Heaven</HI> in it. <HI>Tuckney,</HI> his <HI>Prelectiones,</HI> are an inestimable Treasure. So are those of <HI>Prideaux.</HI> The <HI>Works</HI> of an <HI>Hemingius</HI> deserve a greater Title than that of <HI>Opus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ula.</HI> The <HI>Loci Communes</HI> of <HI>Are∣tius,</HI> have <HI>uncommon</HI> Riches in them. <HI>Edwards,</HI> his <HI>Theologia Reformata,</HI> also will be no Contempti∣ble Treasure for you, on all Occasions. You might Wonder at me, if I should forget <HI>Calvin</HI>'s <HI>Institutions,</HI> to which the Concurrent Opinion of them that wished well to the Reformed Religion assigned a Preference before all the Writings that
<PB N="85" REF="002772_0055_0FE62EFCCB4AEE20"/>the Church of GOD has enjoyed since the <HI>Aposto∣lical;</HI> as the well known <HI>Distich</HI> has informed you. Some that have written on, <HI>The Creed,</HI> are highly Worthy of being your Instructors. Parti∣cularly, a <HI>Pearson,</HI> and a <HI>Witsius.</HI> But after all, there, is nothing that I can with so much Plero∣phorie Recommend unto you, as a <HI>Mastricht,</HI> his <HI>Theologia Theoretico practica.</HI> That a Minister of the Gospel may be <HI>Thoroughly furnished unto every Good Work,</HI> and in one or two <HI>Quarto</HI> Volumns enjoy a <HI>well furnished Library,</HI> I know not that the Sun has ever shone upon an Humane Composure that is equal to it: And I can heartily Subscribe unto the Commendation which <HI>Pontanus,</HI> in his <HI>Laudatio Funebris</HI> upon the Author, has given of it. <HI>De hoc Opere confidenter affirmo, quod eo Ordine sit digestum, tanto rerum pondere praegnans et tumidum, tanta et tam varia Eruditione refertum, ut nescio an in illo genere usquam Gentium exstet aliqnid magis accura∣tum et elaboratum.</HI> I hope, you will next unto the <HI>Sacred Scripture,</HI> make a <HI>Mastricht</HI> the <HI>Store-house</HI> to which you may resort continually.

<P>That you may have a general Insight into POLEMIC DIVINITY, and at once make a short Visit with Safety, to the Camp in the Valley of <HI>Elah,</HI> and see the <HI>Men of Israel fighting with the Philistines,</HI> you have much done for you in <HI>Pri∣deaux,</HI> his, <HI>Fasciculus:</HI> But there are two little <HI>Duo∣decimo's,</HI> which for this Purpose are worth more than Twelve times their Weight in Gold; These are the, <HI>Turris David,</HI> and the, <HI>Turris Babel,</HI> of the Wondrous <HI>Alsted.</HI> There is also a little Book in the English Tongue, <HI>Sinclare,</HI> his, <HI>Truths Victory over Error,</HI> which is worthy to be called, <HI>Enchiri∣dion Militis Christiani.</HI> I will say nothing of a lit∣tle Book published among ourselves under the Title of, <HI>Supplies from the Tower of David.</HI></P>
<P>As for more <HI>particular Controversies</HI> in Religion, I will not perplex you with a Tedious <HI>Catalogue</HI> of what has been <HI>best Written</HI> on the several Con∣troverted Points. You will not much trouble yourself with them, till the Providence of GOD call you to the Wars, and bring the Occasions for it.</P>
<P>However. that I may leave nothing untouched that you may look for, I will just say thus much. To encounter the <HI>Romanists,</HI> you will be admira∣bly furnished in the <HI>Panstratia</HI> of a <HI>Chamier,</HI> or the <HI>Synopsis Papismi</HI> of a <HI>Willet,</HI> or the very learned Works of a <HI>Jackson.</HI> To confute the <HI>Arians,</HI> I commend unto you, a <HI>Waterland,</HI> and a <HI>Guise,</HI> and a <HI>Pike.</HI> To confute the <HI>Socinians,</HI> I commend an <HI>Owen,</HI> an <HI>Abbady,</HI> and a <HI>Cloppenburg,</HI> and a <HI>Stilling,
<PB N="87" REF="002772_0056_0FE62EFE9112C210"/>fleet,</HI> and a <HI>Bisterfield.</HI> Upon the <HI>Quinquarticular Controversies,</HI> you'l see who's to Friend, in <HI>Prin,</HI> his <HI>Antiarminianism.</HI> To which, I would have you add, the <HI>Veritas Redux,</HI> of an <HI>Edwards.</HI> The <HI>Antipedo∣baptists</HI> have been confuted by such an Army of Writers, that except I should single out a <HI>Baxter,</HI> I can scarce tell whom to pitch upon for your Assistance. A little <HI>Conference</HI> Entituled, <HI>Baptistes,</HI> reprinted among us, will give you the Sum of the Matter. <HI>Faldo</HI> has done enough against the <HI>Quakers.</HI> For the <HI>Theologia Gubernetica,</HI> as 'tis cal∣led, I will only mention to you, The, <HI>Politia Ecclesiastica</HI> of a <HI>Parker;</HI> The <HI>Altare Damascenum</HI> of a <HI>Didoclavius;</HI> The <HI>Fresh Suit</HI> of a <HI>Gillespy;</HI> A <HI>Baxter,</HI> of <HI>Episcopacy;</HI> and a <HI>Pierce,</HI> his <HI>Vindication of the Dissenters;</HI> and an <HI>Owen,</HI> Of the <HI>Nature of the Gospel Church.</HI></P>
<P>But it is of the last Importance, that you be a GOOD CASUIST: And an <HI>Ames,</HI> in his <HI>Casus Conscientiae,</HI> an <HI>Alsted,</HI> in his <HI>Theologia Casuum,</HI> a <HI>Baxter</HI> in his <HI>Directory,</HI> and a <HI>Baldwin,</HI> in his Book, <HI>De Casibus Conscientiae,</HI> have done what will abun∣dantly Qualify you to pass a <HI>Judgment</HI> upon the <HI>Cases,</HI> that may ly before you, and well distin∣guish the <HI>Clean</HI> from the <HI>Unclean,</HI> in your Dis∣charge of your Ministry.</P>
<P>Abundance has been written, to recommend, <HI>The Study of the FATHERS:</HI> And it has been re∣commended by none more than some <HI>Neotericks</HI> and <HI>Innovators,</HI> who have had very <HI>Indirect Inten∣tions</HI> in it, and hoped that the <HI>Fathers</HI> might help them with some Traditions, where the <HI>Scriptures</HI> failed them. What Attempts have there been therefore to set the <HI>Epistles</HI> of <HI>Ignatius</HI> almost on
<PB N="88" REF="002772_0057_0FE62EFE979C0D58"/>the Level with the <HI>Epistles</HI> of our Inspired Apostles; while after all the learned Impertinencies, where∣with some would maintain the larger, and some the lesser Copies of those <HI>Epistles,</HI> and painful Disputations, on the Problem, <HI>How many of them are Genuine;</HI> They are all of them <HI>Impostures,</HI> and not worthy of any Notice with you. What ado has there been, to set up, <HI>The Apostolical Constitu∣tions</HI> as the most Valuable Part of the <HI>New Testa∣ment;</HI> when they are evidently despicable and detestable <HI>Forgeries;</HI> and the Collections of some Ignorant <HI>Arian</HI> in the Fifth Century? You may be sure, that in the <HI>Study of the Fathers,</HI> I shall at least advise you to so much Knowledge of them, as <HI>Daille</HI> in his Excellent Book of, <HI>The Use of the Fathers,</HI> will instruct you in. But, tho' the <HI>Fa∣thers</HI> had such <HI>Errors,</HI> that we may most sensibly Bless GOD, for His granting us the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> to be on all Accounts Better and Safer <HI>Guides</HI> unto us, and the <HI>Fathers</HI> themselves do times without Number urge us to take none but the <HI>Scriptures</HI> for our <HI>Guides,</HI> and their notorious <HI>Deficiences</HI> in several Points of Literature, laid them under <HI>Dis∣advantages</HI> enough to pall and spoil our Adorati∣on of them! Nevertheless, there are those Writings of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> which I would have you no Strang∣er to. If you bestow a Perusal upon, the Epistles of <HI>Clemens Romanus,</HI> and the <HI>Apologies</HI> of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> and of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and the Book of <HI>Origen</HI> against <HI>Celjus,</HI> you will do what I would have you to do. And I am willing you should look upon the <HI>Dialogue</HI> of <HI>Minutius Faelix</HI> as one of the most celebrated Monuments of Antiquity. But how can I perswade you to peruse all the Folio-Vo∣lumns,
<PB N="89" REF="002772_0057_0FE62EFE979C0D58"/>of both the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers? In∣deed. I look on <HI>Theodoret,</HI> as the best Expositor of the Bible among all the <HI>Fathers;</HI> and there are very Notable and Refined Expositions often occurring in him; Yet I shall direct you to do little more than <HI>Consult him upon Occasion.</HI> I value <HI>Chrysostom</HI> al∣most as much as much as they tell us <HI>Aquinas</HI> did: Yet I shall only wish you to attend upon him in some <HI>Select Homilies;</HI> and, <HI>Consult him upon Occasion.</HI> I am not so enamoured on <HI>Austin,</HI> as (like <HI>Jan∣senius</HI>) to Read over all his Works ten times, and his Book, <HI>De Gratia,</HI> thirty times; I shall count it enough, if you go thro' his, <HI>Confessions,</HI> and his <HI>Meditations,</HI> and his <HI>De Civitate Dei,</HI> and some Numbers of his <HI>Letters. Scultet</HI> in his, <HI>Medulla Theologiae Patrum,</HI> have given you such <HI>Abstracts</HI> of what has been written by many of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> as your Eye to good Purpose may dwell upon. But for a more agreeable and profitable <HI>Study of the Fathers,</HI> I shall propose, That you go thro' <HI>Dupin,</HI> his <HI>Ecclesiastical History:</HI> And where you find an Account of any <HI>Subject</HI> handled by any <HI>Father,</HI> which you have a particular Inclination to see what they say upon: <HI>Then</HI> turn to the Author, and seek for further Satisfaction.</P>
<P>§. 16. After all this <HI>Preparation for the Sanctuary,</HI> you are now coming to feed the Flocks on the <HI>High Mountains of Israel;</HI> Coming into an Em∣ployment among the People of GOD, in which, I wish you may prove like the <HI>Angel,</HI> in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> that <HI>came down from Heaven, and the Earth was ligh∣tened with his Glory.</HI> I am now going to bring you into the PULPIT: Which I hope, you
<PB N="90" REF="002772_0058_0FE62F0F99DFCF50"/>will ascend [as <HI>Luther,</HI> when he was much older than you, says, <HI>he still always did!</HI>] with a <HI>Trem∣bling Soul;</HI> and remembring that you are to stand, where, that which the Jewish Senator said unto the greatest Person among them, is what the Peo∣ple of GOD may say unto you; <HI>Non stas coram nobis, sed coram eo qui dixit,</HI> Fiat, <HI>et factus est Mundus.</HI></P>
<P>There is a <HI>Troop</HI> of Authors, and even an <HI>Host of GOD,</HI> who have written on, <HI>The Pastoral Care,</HI> from the Days of <HI>Gregory,</HI> down to the Days of <HI>Gilbert;</HI> Yea, and since these, every Year some to this very Day. I cannot set you so tedious a Task, as to Read a <HI>Tenth Part,</HI> of what has been offered on the <HI>Art,</HI> and the <HI>Gift,</HI> and the <HI>Method</HI> of PREACHING. If you Read, the <HI>Pastor E∣vangelicus,</HI> of a <HI>Bowles;</HI> Or, <HI>The Preacher,</HI> of an <HI>Edwards;</HI> you will do as much this Way, as I shall at present ask you to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>First Thing,</HI> which I have to demand of you, is, That you entertain the People of GOD, with none but <HI>Well-Studied Sermons;</HI> and employ none but <HI>well beaten Oil,</HI> for the <HI>Lamps</HI> of the <HI>Golden Candlestick:</HI> And be nothing like him, who was among the <HI>Jews</HI> called, <HI>The Plagiary Prophet,</HI> and whose Punishment was not an easy one. Heaven forbid, that you should be one of those <HI>Pitiful Parsons,</HI> to whom there has been that Ad∣vice given for the Discharge of their <HI>Pastoral Care;</HI> That <HI>they should use other Men's Sermons, rather than make any of their own: But in the Choice of these, use great Judgment, and not take an Author that is too much above themselves; for by that, Compared with
<PB N="91" REF="002772_0058_0FE62F0F99DFCF50"/>their ordinary Conversation, it will too evidently ap∣pear that they are not the Authors of their Sermons.</HI> Tis true; The Composures of them that have gone before you, may be <HI>of Use</HI> unto you, to sup∣ply you with <HI>Useful Hints</HI> for the Composing of your <HI>Sermons.</HI> And some have ingeniously assert∣ed it, <Q>That a Man of <HI>Mean Abilities,</HI> may come to fall very little short of the <HI>Ablest Preachers,</HI> if he so carefully <HI>Peruse</HI> their Sermons, as entirely to <HI>digest</HI> them, and then, laying them out of his <HI>View,</HI> proceed in his <HI>own Way,</HI> and in his <HI>own Style,</HI> to deliver them.</Q> Let <HI>that</HI> be as Men please; <HI>This</HI> I insist upon; That when you are to <HI>Preach,</HI> you should go directly from your Knees in your <HI>Study</HI> to the <HI>Pulpit;</HI> and when you are thus on your Knees in your <HI>Study,</HI> you should be∣wayl the <HI>Faulty Defects</HI> in your Life, which the <HI>Subject</HI> you are to treat upon should lead you to a pentient Confession of: Humbly bewayling it also, that your <HI>Sermon</HI> is no better fitted for the awful Service that is before you. Your <HI>Sermon</HI> must al∣so be such, that you may hope to have the <HI>Blood</HI> of your SAVIOUR sprinkled on it, and His <HI>Good</HI> SPIRIT breathing in it. A <HI>Sermon</HI> likewise it must be, that shall discover you to be a <HI>Workman;</HI> and be, like the <HI>Peace-Offerings</HI> of old, an Oblation, which, as the People of GOD have their share in it, so, 'tis presented unto the Glorious GOD Himself, the <HI>Great King, whose Name is Venerable.</HI> How such things as these, can be Compatible to <HI>stolen Sermons,</HI> or Concomitant with them, I can∣not imagine!</P>
<P>I pass on, to advise you, That when you be∣come a <HI>settled Prcacher</HI> the <HI>Subject</HI> of your <HI>Sermens</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="002772_0059_0FE62F0F9E83B8C8"/>may be so <HI>well chosen,</HI> as to do therein the part of a <HI>Prudent and Faithful Steward,</HI> who dispenses to every one their <HI>Food</HI> in the <HI>Season</HI> thereof; and a Vigilant <HI>Watchman,</HI> contriving such <HI>Words in Sea∣son,</HI> as will be <HI>fitly spoken.</HI> You may do well to go thro' the whole <HI>Body of Divinity,</HI> in a proper <HI>Method,</HI> and therein <HI>declare the whole Counsel of GOD.</HI> There are also some Rich <HI>Portions,</HI> and <HI>Paragraphs</HI> of the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> wherein the SPIRIT of GOD lays together an admirable Variety of im∣portant <HI>Subjects,</HI> which you may do well to han∣dle, in the <HI>Order</HI> wherein He has provided them for you. But still, notwithstanding the Connec∣tion of your Discourses, I would have you leave Room for <HI>Occasional Subjects;</HI> and have your <HI>Pa∣rentheses</HI> of <HI>Sermons</HI> on such Things, as you may apprehend the <HI>Necessities</HI> of the People may more immediately and importunately call for. So, be∣ing as a <HI>Thick Cloud</HI> that has <HI>Water bound up</HI> in it, you shall (as the Ancients expounded that Passage in <HI>Job</HI>) distil it in Drops, <HI>Juxta Exigentiam Audi∣torum.</HI> That you may be led from time to time unto such Subjects as may best answer the <HI>Designs</HI> with which your Ministry is to be carried on, you must have your <HI>Eyes ever towards the Lord,</HI> and with Solemn Supplications look up to Him, who <HI>Ministreth Seed to the Sower.</HI> But let me particu∣larly commend one piece of Discretion unto you; which is, That you may be so <HI>laid in Aforehand,</HI> as never to be at a Loss, what Subject your Stu∣dies are to proceed upon. From the Want of this Provision, how often have I known a <HI>Preach∣er</HI> spend almost as much Time in determining what Subject he should preach upon, as there
<PB N="93" REF="002772_0059_0FE62F0F9E83B8C8"/>need go for the making of a <HI>Sermon</HI> upon it! But I very much Object against your being <HI>too long up∣on a Subject:</HI> Which way of tedious Amplification, must needs leave much of the <HI>sacred Field</HI> un∣plough'd upon, that is too rich to ly always neg∣lected; and produce many Sermons as <HI>little to the Text,</HI> as I suspect many of that <HI>German Divine</HI>'s were, who undertook to go over the whole Book of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> and was no less than <HI>Twenty Years</HI> on the <HI>First Chapter</HI> of it.</P>
<P>And here, I cannot go any further, until I have given you my Sentiments upon something that calls for a great Consideration with you.</P>
<P>Among all the Subjects, with which you <HI>Feed</HI> the People of GOD, I beseech you, Let not the true <HI>Bread of Life</HI> be forgotten; but exhibit as much as you can of a Glorious CHRIST unto them: Yea, Let the <HI>Motto</HI> upon your whole Ministry, be, CHRIST IS ALL. It has been among the <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which I have seen in the Days of my Pilgrimage, that not only in some of the most celebrated <HI>Sermons,</HI> which we have seen published on the most Illustrious and Memo∣rable Occasions, a CHRIST is (not one <HI>Tenth Part</HI> so often mentioned, as He is only in the <HI>Ten</HI> first Verses of the First Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> I say) not so much as <HI>once</HI> mentioned; but also some of your Great Men have it related of them as an Instance of their <HI>Wisdom,</HI> that they gave it as their Advice unto Ministers, <HI>That they should not Preach much about the Person of CHRIST.</HI> I have thought; Would a Blessed PAUL have <HI>uttered</HI> such a Word! A PAUL, who said, <HI>I determined
<PB N="94" REF="002772_0060_0FE62F10A4C7BDB0"/>to know nothing among you, save JESUS CHRIST, and Him Crucified.</HI> It is reported by some Tra∣vellers, That in the <HI>Mah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>metan Moschs,</HI> there are sometimes <HI>whole Sermons</HI> on the Glories of a JE∣SUS. And shall they who call themselves <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> and would be honoured as <HI>Ministers of the Christian Religion,</HI> preach as if they were <HI>ashamed</HI> of making the <HI>Glories</HI> of a JESUS, the <HI>Subject</HI> of their <HI>Sermons;</HI> and so rarely introduce Him, as if it were an <HI>Indecent Stoup</HI> to speak of Him! GOD forbid! I make no Doubt of it, That the almost Epidemical Extinction of True <HI>Christianity,</HI> or what is little short of it, in the Nations that pro∣fess it, is very much owing to the inexcuseable <HI>Impiety</HI> of overlooking a Glorious CHRIST, so much in the <HI>Empty Harangues,</HI> which often pass for <HI>Sermons.</HI> Alas, That there should be so many <HI>Preachers,</HI> (I can't say of the <HI>Gospel!</HI>) to whom there might be commended as proper for them, the Treatise Entituled, <HI>Paraenesis ad Pseudo-Evange∣licos nostri Saeculi, de CHRISTO DEO ipsis IGNOTO!</HI> The Holy SPIRIT of GOD forever aims at no∣thing more, than what our SAVIOUR has de∣clared in that Word; <HI>He will Glorify me:</HI> And that Holy SPIRIT withdraws from the <HI>Ministry,</HI> which has in it little Concern to <HI>Glorify Him;</HI> and it is therefore an <HI>Unsuccessful Ministry.</HI> Let your <HI>Performance</HI> in the <HI>Pulpit</HI> be what it will, I must freely tell you, <HI>Non sapit mihi, nisi sonuerit ibi JE∣SUS.</HI> What I wish for and urge to, is This; That your <HI>Knowledge of the Mystery of CHRIST,</HI> may Conspicuously shine in your <HI>Sermons;</HI> and that it may be esteemed by you, as a Matchless <HI>Grace given</HI> you, if you may <HI>Preach the Unsearchable
<PB N="95" REF="002772_0060_0FE62F10A4C7BDB0"/>Riches of CHRIST</HI> unto the World. The <HI>Heavens do Praise that Wonder;</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> in the <HI>Heavens</HI> are swallowed up in the <HI>Praises</HI> of that <HI>Wondrous ONE!</HI> Be, like <HI>Them,</HI> never so much in your Ele∣ment, as when the <HI>Person,</HI> the <HI>Offices,</HI> the <HI>Benefits,</HI> the <HI>Example,</HI> the <HI>Abasement,</HI> and <HI>Advancement</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, are the <HI>Subjects</HI> of your <HI>Ser∣mons;</HI> yea, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckon that the <HI>Truth</HI> is not well dis∣cerned, nor the <HI>Word of Truth well divided,</HI> until you have <HI>the Truth as it is in JESUS;</HI> HE is that <HI>Light of GOD,</HI> in which you will <HI>See Light,</HI> and every <HI>Truth</HI> will be set in its <HI>True Light</HI> before you. In every <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>Treatises</HI> which you bring into the <HI>Assemblies of Zion,</HI> ponder upon This; What <HI>Aspect</HI> a Glorious CHRIST has upon the <HI>Truth</HI> now before you, and let your Hearers be made sensible of it. Yea, Whatever Point you are upon, Think, <HI>What is there in my SAVI∣OUR, which this Point leads me to think upon!</HI> If you Preach on the <HI>Evil of Sin,</HI> and the <HI>Misery</HI> of Man fallen by <HI>Sin,</HI> still carry your Hearers to their mighty and only SAVIOUR; When you Preach on the <HI>Duties</HI> of a <HI>Godly,</HI> and <HI>Sober,</HI> and <HI>Righteous Life,</HI> still carry your Hearers to their SAVIOUR, as not only affording a <HI>Pattern</HI> for all those things, but also as Offering to <HI>live,</HI> and act, and work in them, as a <HI>Principle of Life,</HI> by which alone they can live unto GOD. Let me tell you, to take the Way of <HI>Norris</HI> and Company, to come at the <HI>Love of GOD,</HI> without a CHRIST <HI>by the Law of the Spirit of Life in us making us free from the Law of Sin and of Death;</HI> Verily, 'Twill <HI>never do!</HI> A Mahometan <HI>Abubeker,</HI> in a <HI>Self taught Philosopher,</HI> has as high Flights of <HI>Divinity</HI> as many of these

<P>But then, I must herewithal advise you, That the Genuine <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> be all of them al∣ways with you, as the very <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> of your <HI>Sermons:</HI> They will be <HI>Putrified Things</HI> without them! Assert always the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>Turning,</HI> and <HI>Living</HI> unto GOD; and yet such an <HI>Impotency</HI> in the wounded and corrupt Faculties of Man, as renders a <HI>Supernatural</HI> and <HI>Regenerating</HI> Work of <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> necessary for it. Show People how to plead the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of our SAVIOUR, that they may be <HI>Forgiven,</HI> and how to lay hold on His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> that they may be <HI>Accepted</HI> with GOD. Show People how to Overcome,
<PB N="97" REF="002772_0061_0FE62F10A9ACF5E8"/>and Mortify, and Crucify their <HI>Evil Appetites,</HI> by repairing to the <HI>Cross</HI> of our SAVIOUR; and how to derive <HI>Strength</HI> from Him for the <HI>Doing,</HI> and the <HI>Bearing</HI> of all that they are called unto. Show the People of GOD, how to take the Comfort of their <HI>Eternal Election,</HI> and <HI>Special Redemption,</HI> and <HI>Ensured Perseverance;</HI> and at the same Time fetch mighty Incentives to <HI>Holiness,</HI> from those <HI>Hopes,</HI> which will forever Cause those that have them to <HI>purify themselves. Gospellize</HI> to them all the Com∣mandments of the <HI>Law,</HI> and show them how to obey upon the Principles of the <HI>Gospel:</HI> And how the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the Gospel are also so many <HI>Promi∣ses</HI> of it. With a strong Application Study the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> and let the Spirit of that <HI>Cove∣nant</HI> animate and regulate all your Performances, when you <HI>Bless the Lord in the Congregations.</HI> In these Truths there are the <HI>Articles,</HI> which the Church either <HI>stands</HI> or <HI>falls</HI> withal. They <HI>will be the Life</HI> of your Ministry: Nor can the <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> be maintained without them. The Loss of these <HI>Truths</HI> will render a Ministry Insipid and Unfruitful; and procure this Complaint a∣bout the <HI>Shepherds, The diseased ye have not streng∣thened, neither have ye brought again, that which was driven away.</HI></P>
<P>That you may be well versed in these <HI>Truths,</HI> it will be requisite, that your <HI>Main Reading</HI> may not be of such Books that have been much in Vogue, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce <HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Vital</HI> PIETY has been so much Banished out of the World, but are as Lame in these Points, as that which is [<HI>unjustly</HI> and <HI>unsafe∣ly</HI> enough] Entituled, <HI>The Whole Duty of Man.</HI> There is a <HI>Set of Books</HI> which of late Years have
<PB N="98" REF="002772_0062_0FE62F1F2C915128"/>brought in a <HI>Fashionable Divinity;</HI> with the Au∣thors whereof, I cannot but be in as Ill Terms, as <HI>Gildas</HI> was with his British Clergy, when with him a Man was, <HI>Non eximie Christianus,</HI> who did not call them rather the <HI>Betrayers,</HI> than the <HI>Mi∣nisters</HI> of the <HI>Gospel.</HI> I can by no means wish you to take your <HI>Divinity</HI> from them; or to be unac∣quainted with the Castigations, which GOD has raised up one of <HI>their Church</HI> [an <HI>Edwards,</HI> I mean,] to bestow upon them. In short, If a Book that pretends to describe the Way of a <HI>Sinners Reconcilia∣tion unto GOD,</HI> says nothing of, <HI>By the Obedience of One, many made Righteous:</HI> If a Book that pre∣tends to direct a <HI>Christian Life,</HI> says nothing of a <HI>Conversion to GOD,</HI> and of being <HI>Joined unto the Lord,</HI> thro' His <HI>One Spirit</HI> Quickening of us: And if a Book [that shall be written perhaps by One who hath subscribed our <HI>Thirty Nine Articles,</HI>] dresses up our Doctrine of <HI>Predestination</HI> in the Fallacious and Invidious Terms, and the <HI>Bearskins</HI> in which it is now commonly Exploded, and proclaims the Author did not <HI>Believe</HI> in his <HI>Heart,</HI> the <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Homilies,</HI> which his Prevaricating <HI>Hand</HI> made a Subscription to, [Or if it be a Book that shall any where spitefully link <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Ge∣neva</HI> together:] <HI>Hunc tu, studiose, caveto.</HI> I had as good plainly say, Let not <HI>Scott,</HI> and Company, be the <HI>Men of your Counsel.</HI></P>
<P>You may Expect, that I should more Positively say, What English <HI>Treatises of Practical Divinity,</HI> I would commend unto you. But here I am en∣cumbred as <HI>Hevelius</HI> was, when he would have so partitioned his accurate <HI>Selenography</HI> as to have
<PB N="99" REF="002772_0062_0FE62F1F2C915128"/>done Justice unto the Names of all the more Il∣lustrious <HI>Astronomers.</HI> Yea, so <HI>Great is the Army of them who have published the True Gospel,</HI> that I can∣not pretend unto the long List of them that have <HI>come to the Help of the Lord.</HI> However, there are a few that must be particularized for you. More particularly then, If you would see the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD and the <HI>Gospel</HI> in an Evangelical Exhibi∣tion of it, Let <HI>Strong</HI> on the <HI>Covenant</HI> (tho' under the Disadvantages of a Posthumous Work) be precious to you as the <HI>Golden Wedge of Ophir.</HI> If you would see <HI>Sound Doctrine,</HI> the Works of an <HI>Owen</HI> have it for you: And I am glad to see, how much esteemed they are in the North-British Universities. You have a <HI>Goodwin</HI> that will place you among the <HI>Children of Light,</HI> and will give you the very <HI>Marrow</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine which is accord∣ing to Godliness:</HI> He often soars like an <HI>Eagle;</HI> Perhaps, you would have been content, if some∣times a little more <HI>Concisely.</HI> Every thing of a <HI>Pol∣hil,</HI> is Evangelical and Valuable: Especially his, <HI>Speculum Theologiae in Christo.</HI> When your Heart and your Pen want the <HI>Holy Fire</HI> to be quickened with you, a <HI>Baxter</HI> will bring you a <HI>Coal from the Altar</HI> for it. Yea, to fetch a Metaphor from ano∣ther Element, he may be called, as you may re∣member who was of old, <HI>An Ocean of Divinity.</HI> To say of that very Great Man, <HI>That if he had not meddled in too many things, he would have been esteem∣ed one of the Learned Men of the Age,</HI> 'tis to speak a Thing which I don't well understand: For his <HI>meddling in so many Things,</HI> and writing more lear∣nedly upon the most of them (except his <HI>Exposi∣tions</HI>) than the most of them who have written
<PB N="100" REF="002772_0063_0FE62F1F30D98610"/>upon perhaps but one or two of the Things, to me renders him <HI>One of the most Learned of the Age.</HI> In a <HI>Charnock</HI> you will have <HI>Substantial Divinity,</HI> and of the Right sort. A <HI>Bates</HI> will treat you with <HI>Angels Food.</HI> An <HI>How</HI> will set <HI>Manly Religi∣on</HI> before you. In a <HI>Flavel,</HI> you will find the true Savour of Plain, Lively, Useful Preaching. What a <HI>Collings</HI> has written on <HI>Providence,</HI> is well per∣formed. And what a <HI>Ford</HI> has written on, <HI>The Spirit of Bondage and Adoption,</HI> is as fine as any thing I have seen for, <HI>the Experimental</HI> And, tho' a <HI>Doolittle</HI> may not pass for one of our <HI>Greatest Men,</HI> yet having in his Book on the <HI>Catechism,</HI> given us the <HI>Body of Divinity</HI> all in a Flame, I am willing that it should be, [what <HI>Zoroaster</HI> called his famous Book, <HI>Zundavesta,</HI> which, tho' written above two and twenty Hundred Years ago, we still have in our Hands,] a <HI>Fire Kindler</HI> for you, and put you in the Way after an Awakening Manner, to set <HI>Conscience</HI> about its Work, when you come to that <HI>Application,</HI> with which your <HI>Sermons</HI> are still to be enlivened. If you go further back, and e∣ven up to a <HI>Perkins,</HI> you will find in many Trea∣tises, that <HI>Good old Puritan Divinity,</HI> which the Ho∣nours of, <HI>The old Way,</HI> belong unto: And, <HI>No Man having drunk that old Wine,</HI> and such Books, as the <HI>Christians Daily Walk,</HI> of a <HI>Scudder, will</HI> much <HI>desire the new, but he will say, The old is Better.</HI> If we mean to go to Heaven, we shall not miss our Way by having <HI>Isaac Ambrose</HI> in our Compa∣ny. I say nothing of a <HI>Preston,</HI> and a <HI>Bolton,</HI> and a <HI>Capel,</HI> and a <HI>Fenner,</HI> and a <HI>Rogers,</HI> and a <HI>Sibbs,</HI> and an <HI>Hall:</HI> All highly Valuable. But I cannot for∣bear saying, the Writings of the <HI>Dyke</HI>'s, (both
<PB N="101" REF="002772_0063_0FE62F1F30D98610"/><HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI>) have a singular Flavour and Vigour in them. Every thing of an <HI>Arrowsmith,</HI> is admirable. A <HI>Gurnal</HI> will furnish you with a <HI>Magazine,</HI> of Good Things. Of an A. <HI>Burgess,</HI> I may say, <HI>He has written for thee Excellent Things.</HI> A <HI>Reinolds</HI> too must be taken into the List of them, who have written what none will Repentt he Reading of. His Preparations are <HI>Fat things full Marrow, Wines from the Lees well refined.</HI> And some things of a <HI>Burroughs,</HI> especially his, <HI>Moses's Choice,</HI> will not make you complain, that you have lost your Time in Conversing with them.</P>
<P>In fine; The Six Volumns of, <HI>The Morning Ex∣ercises,</HI> will give you such a <HI>Variety,</HI> both of <HI>Mat∣ters</HI> and of <HI>Talents,</HI> that I could wish you may not be without them.</P>
<P>I may not omit giving you the best Encourag∣ment I can, to allow unto a Box of <HI>North-British</HI> Authors, a standing in your Library, and often re∣sort unto it. The Jews have a Fancy, that when our Almighty Creator, bespangled the Heavens with the <HI>Stars of Light,</HI> He left a space near the <HI>Northern Pole,</HI> unfinished and unfurnished, that if any <HI>After-God</HI> should lay claim to Deity, a Chal∣lenge to fill up that space might Eternally con∣fute it. But in the <HI>Firmament</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> that <HI>Northern Part</HI> which belongs to <HI>Scotland,</HI> has been illuminated with <HI>Stars,</HI> even enough to make a <HI>Galaxy.</HI> And tho' the assiduous Employments of the <HI>Parish</HI> and the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> which are enough to take up all the Time of their <HI>Pastors,</HI> have prevent∣ed, [which, <HI>'tis a Pity!</HI>] the appearing of so ma∣ny <HI>Writers,</HI> among them, as might otherwise have
<PB N="102" REF="002772_0064_0FE62F216E816158"/>dispensed their <HI>sweet Influences</HI> to us; yet their Pens have not been Idle. Of these we have seve∣ral <HI>Commentators</HI> on the Sacred Scriptures: [A∣mong which, a <HI>Durham,</HI> — especially on the <HI>Com∣mandments!</HI> And a <HI>Weemse</HI> long before him has gi∣ven us a rich Amassment of <HI>Biblical Treasures,</HI> well worth your having.] We have several who have enriched us with Bodies of <HI>Theology;</HI> [Among which, a <HI>Scharpius.</HI>] We have several Champions for the <HI>Doctrines of Grace;</HI> [Among which, a <HI>Ru∣therford.</HI>] We have several <HI>Historians;</HI> [Among which, I will not say, a <HI>Spotswood,</HI> so much as a <HI>Calderwood:</HI> and very lately, a <HI>Woodrow.</HI>] We have several Defenders of the <HI>Gospel-Worship,</HI> and the <HI>Gospel Church-State;</HI> [Among which, a <HI>Gelaspy,</HI> a <HI>Lauder,</HI> a <HI>Willison,</HI> and a <HI>Jameson.</HI> The <HI>Eagle-Ey'd</HI> and <HI>Miraculous</HI> Man last mentioned, has also obliged us, with, <HI>Spicilegia Antiquitatum,</HI> which are invaluable, and preferrible to a <HI>Whole Vintage</HI> of many other Literators.] We have several <HI>Practical Tractators;</HI> [Among which, a <HI>Guthry,</HI> and a <HI>Clark,</HI> and that Wondrous Youth, whose <HI>Green Years</HI> could not withhold from him the Wisdom and Esteem, as he wore the <HI>Name,</HI> of, <HI>Gray!</HI>] It had been some <HI>Injustice</HI> as well as <HI>Ingratitude</HI> in me, to have left these unmentioned. And if a <HI>Burnet</HI> might not have been thought a little too much <HI>Anglified</HI> for it, he should also have had a mention among the Illustrious Pens of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>About the <HI>Way of Studying</HI> a Sermon, I exhort you, That all be with a Spirit of PIETY, and therefore very <HI>Prayerfully,</HI> carried on. 'Tis no more than what the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Intent</HI> of the Ser∣vice
<PB N="103" REF="002772_0064_0FE62F216E816158"/>highly calls for. First look up to Heaven, with Dependence upon a Glorious CHRIST, for His <HI>Influences</HI> and <HI>Assistences</HI> to carry you thro' what you have in Hand. Yea, Repeat the Invo∣cations, with fresh <HI>Elevations of your Eyes</HI> to Him from whom <HI>comes all your Help,</HI> whenever you Re∣turn, after any Intermission of your Study upon it: <HI>O my GOD and SAVIOUR, without Thee I can do nothing; Help me, Help me! Send forth thy Light and thy Truth unto me!</HI> This will be equivalent un∣to the Practice of such Devout Men, as a <HI>Bradford</HI> and a <HI>Cartwright,</HI> Of whom they report, <HI>They studied their Sermons on their Knees.</HI> And when you have dis∣patched a <HI>Paragraph</HI> of a Sermon, I wish it might be a frequent Practice with you, To make a <HI>Pause</HI> upon it; and <HI>get your Sermon by Heart,</HI> I mean, get your <HI>Heart suitably touched</HI> with what you have pre∣pared, before you go any further, and cast into the <HI>Mould</HI> of the <HI>Sanctifying Truths,</HI> by such <HI>Confes∣sions</HI> and such <HI>Petitions,</HI> as you may <HI>Dart</HI> up to Heaven upon them. At least, let this be done, in your <HI>Perusing</HI> of your <HI>Whole Sermon</HI> before your Preaching of it. Some celebrated Preachers have piously declared, <HI>They never durst preach a Sermon to others, till they have got some good by it themselves.</HI> To <HI>feel</HI> what you <HI>speak,</HI> how wondrously will it qualify you to be a <HI>Lively Speaker!</HI> 'Twill bring you to deserve the Title of a <HI>Rabbi Hadarsan.</HI></P>
<P>Be careful evermore to <HI>Preach Scripturally;</HI> and employ the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> if you would hope to do Execution. <HI>Pertinent Scriptures</HI> Demonstrat∣ing and Embellishing every Article, will well be∣come one, who would <HI>Speak as the Oracles of GOD.</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="002772_0065_0FE62F2172C39B00"/>For your Aid in this, I cannot but recommend un∣to your Use, <HI>Ravenellus,</HI> his <HI>Bibliotheca Sacra,</HI> as one of the most Useful Books in the World for a <HI>Preacher,</HI> that would at once have in one Regular, Orderly, Advantageous View, before him, the Sum of what the <HI>Scriptures</HI> have said on every Subject: A Work, that is moreover full of Ex∣positions and Illustrations. There is also a Book Entituled, <HI>A Common Place Book to the Holy Bible;</HI> worth being always at Hand with you.</P>
<P>It would be well, if you could likewise come to say with the Prophet, <HI>I have used Similitudes:</HI> And accustom yourself to find out <HI>Similitudes,</HI> where∣with you may cloath your Ideas, and make them sensible to the lowest and meanest Capacities, yea, to all <HI>Flesh.</HI> Thus to <HI>seek out Acceptable Words,</HI> would render you a most <HI>Profitable</HI> as well as <HI>Agree∣able Preacher.</HI> It would marvellously <HI>fasten the Nails,</HI> and be some Imitation of the <HI>Preaching,</HI> which He that <HI>spake so as never Man spake,</HI> has gi∣ven you a Pattern for.</P>
<P>In your Preaching that you may <HI>Save them that hear you,</HI> I wish you may with all possible Dexte∣rity spread <HI>the Nets of Salvation</HI> for them. And therefore often exhibit the <HI>Terms of Salvation,</HI> and the Proposals of the Gospel, in such a Manner, and so importunately solliciting their <HI>Consent</HI> unto them, that by the hearty Speaking <HI>One Word,</HI> in the <HI>Echo's of Devotion</HI> thereupon, they may be brought into them. Exhibit unto them, the <HI>De∣sires of PIETY,</HI> in such a Manner, that they must have their <HI>Hearts burn within</HI> them, &amp; they must be <HI>Hearts of Stone</HI> indeed, if they take not Fire immediately. When you also describe the <HI>Graces of the New
<PB N="105" REF="002772_0065_0FE62F2172C39B00"/>Creature,</HI> give the Description in the <HI>Language of PIETY,</HI> acting those <HI>Graces;</HI> wherein, if they come into a <HI>Consort</HI> with you, their Souls are gain∣ed unto GOD, at the very Moment of your In∣structing them. Oh! That you may be a <HI>Wise Winner of Souls!</HI> And while you are Preaching, may the Holy SPIRIT <HI>fall on them that hear the Word!</HI></P>
<P>For this Purpose I would have you usually Try, as much as with <HI>Good Judgment</HI> you can, to set the <HI>Truths</HI> on <HI>Fire,</HI> before you part with any <HI>Head</HI> that you are upon; and let them come <HI>Flaming</HI> out of your Hand with Excitations to some <HI>De∣votion</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> of Godliness, into the <HI>Hearts</HI> of those whom they are address'd unto. The <HI>Tongues</HI> with which the Holy SPIRIT made His Descent, on the first and best Preachers of the Gospel that ever were in the World, were <HI>Flames,</HI> and had the Appearance of an <HI>Heavenly Fire</HI> up∣on them.</P>
<P>'Tis Pity but a <HI>Well prepared</HI> Sermon should be a <HI>Well pronounced</HI> One. Wherefore, Avoid for∣ever, all <HI>Inanes sine Mente Sonos;</HI> and all <HI>Indecencies,</HI> every thing that is <HI>Ridiculous.</HI> Be sure to speak <HI>Deliberately.</HI> Strike the <HI>Accent</HI> always upon that <HI>Word</HI> in the Sentence which it properly belongs unto. A <HI>Tone</HI> that shall have no Regard unto This, is very <HI>Injudicious;</HI> and will make you talk too much in the <HI>Clouds.</HI> Don't <HI>Begin</HI> too High. Ever <HI>Conclude</HI> with Vigour. If you must have your <HI>Notes</HI> before you in your Preaching, and it be needful for you, <HI>De Scripto dicere,</HI> what even some of the most famous Ora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors both among the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and among the <HI>Romans</HI> did, [<HI>Pliny</HI> says,
<PB N="106" REF="002772_0066_0FE62F2E4A3F5E08"/><HI>Orationes, et nostri quidam et Greci Lectitaverunt</HI>] yet let there be with you a Distinction between the <HI>Neat using</HI> of <HI>Notes,</HI> and the <HI>dull Reading</HI> of them. Keep up the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Speaking,</HI> and put not off your <HI>Hearers</HI> with an heavy <HI>Reading</HI> to them. How can you demand of them to <HI>Re∣member much</HI> of what you bring to them; when you <HI>Remember nothing</HI> of it yourself? Besides, By <HI>Reading</HI> all you say, you will so cramp and stunt all Ability for <HI>Speaking,</HI> that you'l be unable to make an handsome <HI>Speech</HI> on any Occasion. What I therefore advise you to, is; Let your <HI>Notes</HI> be little other than a <HI>Quiver,</HI> on which you may cast your Eye now and then, to see what <HI>Arrow</HI> is to be next fetch'd from thence; and then, with your Eye as much as may be on them whom you speak to, Let it be shot away, with a <HI>Vivacity</HI> becoming <HI>One in Earnest,</HI> for to have the <HI>Truths</HI> well entertained with the Auditory.</P>
<P><HI>Optimus est Orator, qui dicendo, Animos Audientium, et d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cet, et delecta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, et permovet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finally;</HI> Let your <HI>Perorations</HI> [from which, <HI>Nos∣citur Orator</HI>] often be, lively <HI>Expostulations</HI> with the <HI>Conscience</HI> of the <HI>Hearer; Appeals</HI> made, and <HI>Questions</HI> put, unto the <HI>Conscience,</HI> and Consign∣ments of the Work over into the Hands of that flaming <HI>Preacher</HI> in the Bosom of the Hearer. In such <HI>Flames</HI> you may <HI>Do wondrously!</HI></P>
<P>§. 17. Upon the due Discharge of the <HI>Pastoral Duties,</HI> in which you must labour to <HI>know the State of your Flock,</HI> and lay hold on all Occasions to drop the <HI>Lessons of PIETY</HI> upon them; and, how to manage the <HI>Pastoral Visits</HI> with an admirable
<PB N="107" REF="002772_0066_0FE62F2E4A3F5E08"/><HI>Dexterity</HI> and <HI>Fidelity;</HI> and therein to be forever scattering <HI>Books</HI> among them, which may be last∣ing <HI>Monitors</HI> unto them, and a <HI>Salt</HI> for their Pre∣servation; Yea, and be scattering Alms, like the liberal <HI>Showers</HI> from above, upon the Indigent among them: I suppose, I need now do no more than give a short Hint unto you, <HI>That such Things are to be thought upon.</HI> All that I will now say to you upon this <HI>Pastoral Watchfulness</HI> is This; That when certain <HI>Shepherds</HI> were <HI>Keeping Watch over their Flocks, Lo, The Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the Glory of the Lord shone round about them!</HI></P>
<P>Among the Employments of a <HI>Vigilant Pastor,</HI> I cannot avoid saying of something, <HI>De Catechi∣zandis Rudibus;</HI> and putting you in mind, That Great Things may be done in the Way of <HI>Cate∣chizing.</HI> A Work this is, for which the <HI>Greatest</HI> Men in the Church of GOD, have not thought themselves <HI>too Great:</HI> And some Eminent Persons comingtowards a <HI>Superannuation</HI> for other Services, have by applying themselves almost wholly to <HI>This,</HI> continued very Serviceable to the last. In this Exercise, to break the <HI>Answer</HI> now and then into <HI>Smaller Questions,</HI> and so drop it into narrow∣mouthed Understandings; and thereupon to graft <HI>Exhortations,</HI> which may draw the <HI>Catechumens</HI> into the declared <HI>Resolutions</HI> of PIETY; and more particularly show them, the Blessings for which they are to make their <HI>Supplications,</HI> and gain a <HI>Promise</HI> from to do so: This is one of the Things, where an <HI>Abundance</HI> of <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Pru∣dence,</HI> may be demonstrated. Among the many Hundreds of <HI>Catechisms,</HI> which have made their
<PB N="108" REF="002772_0067_0FE62F2E4E924538"/>Way into the World, What is now most in Use, is, <HI>The Assemblies;</HI> which was composed by Dr. <HI>Tuck∣ney,</HI> Dr. <HI>Arrowsmith,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newcomen,</HI> and A∣dopted and Emitted by the most Venerable Con∣vention of <HI>Divines,</HI> that was ever seen in our Nation. But some have thought, that This, like all other <HI>Humane Composures,</HI> might be capable of some <HI>Amendment.</HI> And I could myself particular∣ly wish; That among the Articles of, <HI>The Misery of the Estate into which Man fell,</HI> there might be in∣serted, <HI>And enslaved unto the Powers of Darkness:</HI> And that among the Articles of, <HI>CHRIST Exe∣cuting the Office of a Priest,</HI> there might be this Clause inserted; <HI>In performing perfect Obedience to the Law of GOD, the Everlasting Rule of Righteous∣ness:</HI> And that among, <HI>The Benefits which in this Life do accompany Justification</HI> — there might be inserted, <HI>The Ministry of Good Angels for our Good, and Succour against the Temptations of the Devils.</HI> Tho' it is not for you to correct the Catechism, yet you may in your <HI>Catechising</HI> do Justice to these Important Articles. <HI>Up, and be Doing;</HI> and be thus, <HI>An Instructor of the Young;</HI> Yea, an <HI>Angel</HI> to the <HI>Little Ones.</HI></P>
<P>But no Good is to be any further expected from you, than it may be Reported of you, <HI>Behold, He PRAYS!</HI> You must, like the <HI>Camel,</HI> receive all your <HI>Burdens</HI> on your <HI>Knees:</HI> And your whole Work must be carried on, with a continual <HI>Pray∣ing</HI> over it.</P>
<P>For your <HI>Secret Prayers,</HI> I can bate you nothing of <HI>David</HI>'s, and of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Number, <HI>Three times in a Day:</HI> For your <HI>Pious Ejaculations,</HI> I have no∣thing against the Number, which they report of
<PB N="109" REF="002772_0067_0FE62F2E4E924538"/>the Apostle <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> [One <HI>Hundred</HI> in a Day!] Yea, Or that which they report of a Father whose Name was <HI>Paulus;</HI> [Three <HI>Hundred</HI> in a Day!] If you can attain so far to have your <HI>Eyes ever to∣wards the Lord.</HI> Excellent is the Counsel of <HI>Lans∣bergius,</HI> in his <HI>Enchiridion Militis Christiani,</HI> [And by the Way, <HI>Erasmus,</HI> his Golden Book of the <HI>same Title,</HI> I earnestly advise you to the Reading of!] <HI>Ex Omnibus quae vides, quaequae audis, disce orandi sumere Occasionem, mentemque ad Deum elevan∣di.</HI> Besides your <HI>stated Prayers</HI> for every Day, you will also have Numberless <HI>Errands to Heaven,</HI> which will oblige you frequently to make your <HI>Occasional Addresses</HI> thither upon Emergencies. But what in a very particular Manner I advise you to, is, Now and then to set a part WHOLE DAYS for Interviews with Heaven; and this with such <HI>Fasting</HI> as you may find you are able to bear, and may be for the Help of your <HI>Devotions.</HI> On such <HI>Days,</HI> go thro' a <HI>Process of Repentance,</HI> which can∣not be too often Repeated. Renew your <HI>Flights</HI> unto your SAVIOUR, that you may be more Quickened in the <HI>Life of GOD.</HI> Present the <HI>Sa∣crifices</HI> wherein you shall offer up your All unto Him, and embrace and enjoy a CHRIST instead of All. Carry to Him all your Concerns; and let all your <HI>Desire be before Him,</HI> and none of your <HI>Groaning be hid from Him.</HI> Let your Petitions for <HI>Others,</HI> and for all the <HI>Societies</HI> you belong unto, Ex∣press the true <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> in your <HI>Supplications,</HI> and be like those of the <HI>Man greatly Beloved.</HI> Soar up as high as you can towards an Union with GOD. Intermix all along, the Reading of proper Things, wherein GOD from the Holy
<PB N="110" REF="002772_0068_0FE62F30947C4B10"/>Oracle may <HI>Commune with you;</HI> and you may Assist and Inflame the Work wherein you are en∣gaged. Let the Minutes of Spaces between your <HI>Devotions,</HI> be filled with <HI>Reflections,</HI> that may have a Tendency to bring you into <HI>Abasements</HI> of your self, or into <HI>Adorations</HI> of your GOD; and from your Heart within you, Let them go up silently unto the Lord. Conclude all, with Holy <HI>Projec∣tions</HI> and <HI>Purposes,</HI> for further Improvements in a Careful, Fruitful, <HI>Humble Walk with GOD.</HI> But how much could I wish, That in this <HI>Religion of the Closet,</HI> you may know what it is to keep <HI>Days of Thanksgiving</HI> too? Such Days, you may fill with <HI>Contemplations</HI> on the <HI>Perfections</HI> of the Infi∣nite GOD, and the <HI>Glories</HI> of your Almighty RE∣DEEMER, and the <HI>wondrous Things</HI> which He has <HI>done;</HI> and the <HI>Ministry of His Angels:</HI> And with Enumerations of the <HI>Favours,</HI> which both on <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and on <HI>Temporal</HI> Accounts you have received from Him; Whereof you should make <HI>Explicit Acknowledgements</HI> unto your Powerful and Merciful Benefactor, and particularly see and own how <HI>Undeserved</HI> they have been, and how <HI>Distinguishing</HI> they have been, and how the contra∣ry Sufferings of CHRIST have purchased them. You will upon Trial find a <HI>Day of the Summer Sol∣stice</HI> too short for the <HI>Pleasa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Work</HI> now before you. Here you may intermix the <HI>Songs of the Re∣deemed;</HI> adding the <HI>Perusal</HI> of what you may find written for the Help of the Heavenward Salleys, wherein you are <HI>mounting up as with the Wings of Eagles.</HI> You will do well, to keep the <HI>Holy Fire</HI> alive all the Day, by making all the Objects which occur to you in the Intervals of your <HI>De∣votions,</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="002772_0068_0FE62F30947C4B10"/>but a Fuel that your <HI>Praises</HI> to GOD shall seize upon, and go up in <HI>short Motions</HI> of Soul un∣to Him. Conclude all, with an Ingenuous Medi∣tation on that Question, <HI>What shall I render to the Lord for all His Benefits?</HI> These Days will not only obtain marvellous <HI>Blessings</HI> for you, but also leave a Caelestial <HI>Flavour</HI> and <HI>Grandeur</HI> on your Mind, and infuse a becoming <HI>Discretion</HI> and <HI>Gra∣vity</HI> into all your Conversation.</P>
<P>One Consequent of these Things will be, what I am very sollicitous you should arrive unto, That is to say, An <HI>Ability</HI> to express yourself in <HI>Prayer</HI> to the Glorious GOD, and spread the <HI>Cases</HI> of the People before Him, on all Occasions: An <HI>Ability</HI> without which, I shall not Judge you Qua∣lified for an <HI>Ordination</HI> to the <HI>Pastoral Care</HI> of a Flock, among the Churches of GOD: But <HI>wor∣thy</HI> to have an ANAXIOS, cried out upon you.</P>
<P>In your doing This, you will have notable Op∣portunities to bring them into the Frames of PIE∣TY, which are to be wished for them.</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>Truths</HI> at any time you would most efficaciously <HI>Preach</HI> unto them, you may make them hear you <HI>Pray</HI> down these <HI>Truths</HI> into them, with a most surprizing and most subduing <HI>Efficacy.</HI></P>
<P>I can by no means approve of your Leaning on the <HI>Tool of a Foolish Shepherd,</HI> and your Living on the <HI>Lifeless Forms of any Liturgy.</HI> I cannot com∣mend any <HI>Liturgy</HI> to you, except that which <HI>Ba∣ronius,</HI> taxed good old <HI>Agobardus</HI> for keeping to. I can do no other than tell you so, after a <HI>Bellarmine</HI> himself has confessed, <Q>That <HI>in old times,</HI> there was <HI>no Form of Prayer prescribed,</HI> for all to be
<PB N="112" REF="002772_0069_0FE62F3098D99280"/>bound unto, but every One might <HI>make what Prayer</HI> he <HI>pleased,</HI> if but the <HI>Analogy of Faith</HI> were kept unto.</Q> And <HI>Chemnitius</HI> with a whole Army of <HI>Protestants,</HI> have irrefragably proved, That this Confession of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> is true; and, <HI>Apud Veteres Ordinem Celebrandi fuisse Arbitrarium.</HI> The Ancients all agree to it, That in the Earlier Days of Christianity, the Ministers <HI>prayed</HI> every where, <HI>As they were Able.</HI> Indeed, there was no General <HI>Imposition</HI> of any <HI>Service Beok,</HI> until the Emperor <HI>Charlemaigne</HI> at the Sollicitation of the Pope, introduced it, with <HI>Persecution;</HI> which was not until the Entrance of the <HI>Ninth Century,</HI> when all manner of Superstitious Usages were brought into the Temple of GOD. Some Judicious Men have complained of the French <HI>Liturgy</HI> composed by the Excellent <HI>Calvin,</HI> for not having sufficient Collects of <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> but being all <HI>Petition.</HI> And whereas these three Things, <HI>Confession,</HI> and <HI>Petition,</HI> and <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> belong to every <HI>complete Prayer,</HI> I have heard some enquire whether ac∣cording to this Rule, there can be readily found One <HI>complete Prayer,</HI> in another <HI>Liturgy,</HI> which I cannot commend unto you, for such a <HI>Model of Perfection,</HI> as its admirers have esteemed it. But waving here those many and weighty Exceptions against the <HI>English Common Prayer-Book,</HI> which will for∣ever cause Myriads of Considerate Christians to be dissatissied with it, I will only Quote some Words that I find falling from the Pen of an Eng∣lish Nobleman. <Q>There may be too great a Re∣straint, [<HI>he says</HI>] put upon Men, whom GOD hath distinguished by giving them not only good Sense, but a Powerful Utterance too. When
<PB N="113" REF="002772_0069_0FE62F3098D99280"/>a Man so Qualified, endued with Learning too, and above all, adorned with a <HI>Good Life,</HI> breaks out into a Warm and Well-delivered <HI>Prayer</HI> be∣fore his <HI>Sermon,</HI> it has the Appearance of a Di∣vine Rapture; He raises and leads the Hearts of the Assembly in another Manner, than the most composed or best studied <HI>Form of Set Words,</HI> can ever do: And the <HI>Pray Wee's,</HI> who serve up all their Sermons with the same Garnishing, would look like so many Statues, or Men of Straw in the Pulpit, compared with those who speak with such a Powerful Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al that Men are tempt∣ed at the Moment to believe, that Heaven itself has dictated these Words unto them.</Q> I cannot but think, that <HI>good Sense</HI> was that which <HI>dictated these Words</HI> unto the Marquess of <HI>Halifax.</HI> And I hope, your <HI>Prayers</HI> will be such as he has there∣in described unto you.</P>
<P>I am sorry, that I must, [But I <HI>must!</HI>] con∣clude my Advice for your <HI>Diligence</HI> in the Dis∣charge of the <HI>Pastoral Duties,</HI> with a <HI>Warning,</HI> That you must not wonder at it, if you find, that you serve many <HI>Ungrateful People,</HI> and may be many Ways Mal-treated by them, who are under the strongest Obligations to support you, and reduced unto the humbling and creepling Circumstances of a, <HI>Res Angusta Domi:</HI> Yea, be oppress'd with grievous <HI>Defraudations</HI> from them, whom GOD will many Ways punish for their <HI>Ingratitude.</HI> If it should be so, yet Remember, you are in the Ser∣vice of a Glorious LORD, who not only says, <HI>I know thy Service,</HI> but orders those Things to fall out, upon which He may with Infinite Pleasine also say, <HI>I know thy Patience.</HI> Be not now discou∣raged
<PB N="114" REF="002772_0070_0FE62F3CEF4E1798"/>from still devoting yourself to the public and private Labours of your <HI>Ministry: Be wholly in them;</HI> and therein Labour to <HI>Overcome Evil with Good.</HI> Suffer any thing, rather than in the Me∣thods of the <HI>Law,</HI> do that which will ruin the Suc∣cess of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and utterly extinguish the Hope of your doing any more <HI>Good</HI> by your Ministry among them. Cause them to <HI>feel,</HI> that you are <HI>travailing</HI> with Agony for the Eternal Salvation of them and theirs; and that the <HI>Gaining</HI> of one Soul to GOD by your Ministry, will be of more Account with you than any <HI>Gain</HI> of this World; than all the <HI>Wealth</HI> in the World. Be they never so <HI>Unjust,</HI> yet nobly hold on <HI>Raining the Blessed Showers</HI> of Heaven upon them! Thus with a <HI>Strong Faith</HI> which <HI>gives Glory to GOD</HI> go on with a Watchful, Painful, Faithful <HI>Ministry,</HI> keeping your Eye on the <HI>Sixth Chapter</HI> of <HI>Matthew,</HI> and Relying on your SAVIOUR for your Subsistence: And, <HI>Never Fear! Never Fear!</HI> He will with strange Interpositions of His Providence, yea, with Conspicuous &amp; Marvellous Operations of the <HI>Angelical Ministry,</HI> send in <HI>Seasonable Supplies</HI> for you; and often make the <HI>Season</HI> of them such as notably to add unto the <HI>Comfort</HI> of them.</P>
<P>— Yea, sooner than <HI>Starve,</HI> the <HI>Ravens</HI> will bring Food unto you. <HI>Regenvolscius</HI> relates it, in his, <HI>History of the Sclavonic Churches;</HI> <Q>It was a wretched Custom of the Papists, that when they had run One of the <HI>Holy People</HI> into Prison, they would there, by a progressive Substraction of all Subsistence from him, starve him to Death. <HI>Matthias Dolanscius</HI> was a Prisoner de∣signed for such Circumstances, in the City of
<PB N="115" REF="002772_0070_0FE62F3CEF4E1798"/><HI>Prague,</HI> — and at length all the Attempts of the Godly People, and of a gracious Matron a∣mong the rest, secretly to relieve him, had a total stop given to them. Now, One Day, when he was on the very point of <HI>Starving,</HI> he cast his Eye towards the Grate of the Prison, and saw a little Bird sitting there, with some∣thing in his Bill. His Curiosity leading him thither, the Bird flew away: but left a bit of Cloth, in which, when he took it up, he found a piece of Gold: And with this piece of Gold, he found Ways tolleraby to furnish himself with Bread, until the Death of the King: On and by which he obtained his full Deliverance.</Q></P>
<P>This I will say to you; Hold on, Hold on, Always at Work for a Glorious CHRIST; and rather than you should starve, <HI>Matthias Dolanscius</HI>'s Bird shall be sent unto you! And unto that Question, <HI>Lacked ye any thing?</HI> You shall be able to give a Comfortable Answer.</P>
<P>§. 18. Too Weighty are the Words of the pious <HI>Hen. Will. Ludolf,</HI> to be left untranscribed, when I am treating you, with the Things which I am desirous to have greatly considered with you. <Q>It a great unhappiness, that the greatest part of the Clergy of all Communions, do not perceive, that GOD is upon His Way to break down all the false Draughts and Schemes, which the An∣tichristian Spirit of <HI>Sectarism</HI> hath contrived in∣stead of <HI>Substantial Christianity,</HI> which is, <HI>The Re∣storing of the Image of GOD in the New Creature,</HI> or, <HI>The Kingdom and Life of GOD within us.</HI></Q> I press you to employ the <HI>deepest Meditation</HI> on this
<PB N="116" REF="002772_0071_0FE62F3CF40258A8"/>Important Matter. When the Lord GOD Omni∣potent comes to <HI>shake not the Earth only, but also Heaven,</HI> it is, That those <HI>Things that cannot be shak∣en may remain.</HI> What are those <HI>Things that cannot be shaken?</HI> But those MAXIMS of the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> wherein all <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Wise</HI> Men are <HI>United,</HI> and all Men become <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Wise,</HI> when they come into that <HI>Union</HI> with them: The MAX∣IMS, which the more they are <HI>studied,</HI> and the <HI>Wiser,</HI> and the <HI>Better,</HI> they are who study them, the more they will be approved of: The MAX∣IMS which are directly calculated for the Grand Intentions of, <HI>Glory to GOD in the Highest,</HI> and <HI>Peace on Earth from a Good Will in Men towards one another.</HI> 'Tis even the <HI>First born</HI> of my Wishes for you, That you may be one of those <HI>Angels,</HI> that shall <HI>fly through the midst of Heaven,</HI> with this <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> to <HI>preach</HI> it unto them who <HI>dwell on the Earth,</HI> and move all the People of GOD, tho' of <HI>different Perswasions</HI> in <HI>lesser Points,</HI> to embrace one another upon the <HI>Generous Max∣ims</HI> of it, and keep <HI>lesser Points</HI> in a due <HI>Subordina∣tion</HI> unto the <HI>Superiour Maxims,</HI> and manage their <HI>Differences</HI> upon those <HI>lesser Points</HI> with another Spirit, than what the <HI>Disputers of this World</HI> in the several <HI>Sects</HI> of Christians keep commonly <HI>Cut∣ting</HI> One another withal.</P>
<P>To assist you in the Discovering and Deter∣mining of these Everlasting MAXIMS, I will not meerly refer you to the Sentiments of a Judi∣cious <HI>Davenant,</HI> in his, <HI>Adhortatio ad Fraternam Communionem inter Evangelicas Ecclesias,</HI> or those of a Sharpsighted <HI>Baxter,</HI> who was a <HI>Pen in the Hand
<PB N="117" REF="002772_0071_0FE62F3CF40258A8"/>of GOD,</HI> when he wrote his <HI>Catholic Unity,</HI> and, <HI>The True and Only Way of Concord:</HI> Much less, will I prosecute the Proposal of our celebrated <HI>Usher,</HI> <Q>That if at this Day we take a Survey of the <HI>several Professions of Christianity,</HI> that have any large Spread in any Part of the World, and should put by the Points wherein they differ from One another, and gather into One Body the rest of the Articles, wherein they all <HI>general∣ly Agree;</HI> we should find, That in those <HI>Propo∣sitions,</HI> which without Controversy are so <HI>Uni∣versally received in the whole Christian World,</HI> so much <HI>Truth</HI> is contained, as, being joined with <HI>Holy Obedience,</HI> may be sufficient to bring a Man unto Everlasting Salvation. Neither have we Cause to doubt, but that as many as do <HI>Walk according to this Rule,</HI> (neither overthrowing that which they have built, by superinducing any <HI>Damnable Heresies,</HI> thereupon, nor otherwise Vitiating their <HI>Holy Faith</HI> with a lewd and <HI>wic∣ked Conversation) Peace shall be upon them.</HI></Q> I will rather exhibit the MAXIMS in such a Manner, as to make the best Provision, against that <HI>loath∣some</HI> thing, <HI>A Lifeless Religion;</HI> whereof an <HI>Irreli∣gious Life,</HI> will be the Natural Consequence. In short, I may as with a <HI>Burning Glass,</HI> [Oh! That with an <HI>Irresistible Heat</HI> from Heaven upon you!] Contract into a little Room, <HI>the Sum of the Mat∣ter,</HI> and the PIETY, which will be sound a <HI>Sure Foundation</HI> for an UNION among all Parties of true CHRISTIANS, however they may be De∣nominated or Distinguished. As our SAVIOUR, whom His FATHER <HI>heareth always,</HI> has prayed, for His People, that they <HI>all may be ONE,</HI> so, it is
<PB N="118" REF="002772_0072_0FE62F3EAEB20678"/>impossible, that all the Genuine People of GOD should not <HI>Unite</HI> with one another in much great∣er Things, than those in which it is possible for them to <HI>Dissent</HI> from one another. Such Things are those <HI>Graviore Evangelii,</HI> which to <HI>cut short the Work in Righteousness,</HI> I shall in these Three MAX∣IMS compendiously set before you.</P>
<Q><P N="1">I. The ONE most High GOD, who is the FATHER, and the SON, and the Holy SPI∣RIT, must be my GOD: And I must make it the <HI>main Intention</HI> of my Life to <HI>Serve</HI> and <HI>Please</HI> Him, in all Holy <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Submission</HI> to Him, Remembring that His Eye is always upon me; and be afraid of <HI>every Thing,</HI> which His <HI>Light</HI> in my Soul shall condemn as an <HI>Evil Thing.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. A Glorious CHRIST who is the Eter∣nal SON of GOD, Incarnate and Enthroned in the Blessed JESUS, is the REDEEMER, on whose great <HI>Sacrifice</HI> I must Rely for my <HI>Recon∣ciliation</HI> to GOD, looking to Him, at the same time, that I may live unto GOD by Him. <HI>Liv∣ing in me:</HI> And under His Conduct I am now to expect a Blessedness in a <HI>Future State,</HI> for my <HI>Immortal Soul;</HI> to which He will restore my <HI>Body,</HI> when He shall come to <HI>Judge the World.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Out of Respect unto GOD and His CHRIST, I must heartily <HI>Love my Neighbour,</HI> and forever do unto <HI>Other Men,</HI> as I must own it Reasonable for them to do unto <HI>myself.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Foundation of GOD</HI> is in these <HI>Holy Moun∣tains.</HI> While these Glorious MAXIMS are [as,
<PB N="119" REF="002772_0072_0FE62F3EAEB20678"/>why should they not be? I am sure much more Questionable Ones, are daily required for to be] subscribed unto, it is to be wished, that these <HI>Two</HI> [I can scarce call them. <HI>Two more</HI>] may in Sub∣serviency to the <HI>First Three,</HI> be also brought into the Subscription.</P>
<P><Q>I adhere to the Sacred SCRIPTURES, as the <HI>sufficient Rule,</HI> for <HI>Belief,</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> among the People of GOD, and I would maintain a <HI>Brotherly Fellowship</HI> with all Good Men, in the Things wherein I apprehend them to follow these <HI>Divine Directions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P><Q>I Declare for the just Liberties of <HI>Mankind,</HI> and of our Nations: And for a Christian En∣couragement in the <HI>Church</HI> for all that observe the Grand MAXIMS of PIETY, accompanied with a free <HI>Indulgence</HI> of <HI>Civil Rights</HI> in the <HI>State,</HI> unto all that approve themselves Faithful <HI>Subjects</HI> and Honest <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and such Inof∣fensive Livers, that <HI>Humane Society</HI> cannot com∣plain of Disturbance from them.</Q></P>
<P>I will not now suppose a <HI>Quinquarticular Con∣troversy,</HI> but rather propose a <HI>Ternarticular Period of all Controversies.</HI> And the very first Thing, that I offer upon it, is, That in these MAXIMS, <HI>of Godliness,</HI> which are all <HI>without Controversy,</HI> you behold all <HI>Controversies</HI> of Religion, as coming to an Amicable and a Comfortable Period. My Ad∣vice to you, is; That when you make some Fi∣gure in the Field of the <HI>Church-Militant,</HI> you be drawn as little as may be, into any <HI>Eristic Writ∣ings;</HI> wherein you shall be surprized unawares
<PB N="120" REF="002772_0073_0FE62F3EB35FCF48"/>into the Errors of <HI>Passion,</HI> and into the <HI>Follies</HI> of taking Pains to convince a few Readers that you have more <HI>Wit</HI> than your Antagonist. Every Man who pulls at the <HI>Polemic Saw,</HI> and manages any <HI>Controversy</HI> in Religion, always pretends a <HI>Zeal</HI> to uphold in the <HI>Issue</HI> of the Disputation, some certain Point of <HI>Practical</HI> PIETY, which is in these Indisputable MAXIMS declared for. If it were not from a <HI>zealous Concern</HI> which the Contenders have that the <HI>Practice of Piety,</HI> may not suffer in such a Point, they profess, that they would not <HI>contend so earnestly for the Faith.</HI> If they can't sincerely make this Profession, they are but <HI>Litigious,</HI> and <HI>Vexatious,</HI> and the <HI>Gladiators</HI> are to be hiss'd off the <HI>Theatre,</HI> by all that wish well to Christianity. Now, how commonly are <HI>both Parties</HI> well agreed, in the Point of PIETY, which the One says, can't be preserved but upon <HI>his Positions;</HI> and the other says, can't be preser∣ved if <HI>his</HI> be denied? Be sure, All the <HI>Truly Pi∣ous</HI> are so! But, if <HI>both Parties</HI> are agreed for that PIETY, which is the Main, and the Scope of all, how much Good may you do, if you can so Sy∣ringe the <HI>Odoriferous Water</HI> of the confessed MAX∣IMS upon them, that the <HI>Quarrelling Hives</HI> in the Loss of their Distinction may give over their Quarrels, and the Children of <HI>Jacob</HI> not <HI>fall out by the Way,</HI> or be so angry about the Way, <HI>seeing they are Brethren?</HI> Or, if the <HI>Brethren</HI> will yet <HI>fall out,</HI> and the <HI>Controversies</HI> must <HI>go on,</HI> and you are called forth to bear a Part in them, yet, <HI>My Son,</HI> continue to play these <HI>Engines,</HI> for the extinguish∣ing of the <HI>Fires;</HI> Govern your <HI>Mind,</HI> and your <HI>Pen,</HI> by the MAXIMS of PIETY; perswade
<PB N="121" REF="002772_0073_0FE62F3EB35FCF48"/>others what you can to do so too; and carry not on any but the <HI>Wars of the Lamb</HI> in your Contes∣tations. What I could most of all wish for is, That for your <HI>Defence</HI> of the <HI>Truth,</HI> which is always for PIETY, you do what you have to do, mostly in that <HI>Positive Way,</HI> of asserting, and evincing, and advancing the PIETY, which the <HI>Truth</HI> you would have to be defended, is to animate. <HI>Con∣science</HI> will quickly come in, with a Testimony on the behalf of that PIETY; and the Truth which appears necessary to support that PIETY, will easily be taken in, and not easily parted with. This is for the most part better than the <HI>Elenctic Way</HI> of sheltering the Truth from the Assaults which they that <HI>corrupt the Earth</HI> would make up∣on it: Instead of <HI>Swords,</HI> it is to employ <HI>Plough-Shares;</HI> Instead of <HI>Spears,</HI> it is to employ <HI>Pruning-Hooks;</HI> and the State and Work of <HI>Paradise</HI> is a little emulated and anticipated.</P>
<P>But, if the <HI>Elenctic Way</HI> become necessary to be taken, and if you must <HI>go down into the Battel,</HI> and smite the Enemies in the <HI>Valley of Salt,</HI> I a∣gain, and again say, <HI>Take heed unto your Spirit:</HI> Let the Designs of PIETY Regulate your whole Proceeding. Furnish no new Matter for the old Complaint of, — <HI>Sibi ferales plerique Christiani;</HI> and add nothing to the Instances of such Outrages, as the <HI>Jesuites</HI> have with Derision censured in the <HI>Controversal Writings</HI> of the mutual Firings between the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and the <HI>Calvinists.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Calvinists!</HI> — Inasmuch as I have thus unawares mentioned These, I will up∣on these make the <HI>Experiment,</HI> [whether with any
<PB N="122" REF="002772_0074_0FE62F48B5046EF8"/>better Success, than my dear <HI>Pitiscus</HI> did, I know not!] how far a <HI>Syneretism</HI> of PIETY will <HI>Unite</HI> the People of GOD, or <HI>Abate</HI> their <HI>Cursed Anger,</HI> and <HI>Cruel Wrath</HI> against One another in pursuing of <HI>Religious Controversies.</HI> The Sagacious Baron <HI>Pussendorf,</HI> while he despairs not of breaking down the <HI>Partition Wall</HI> between those two mighty Par∣ties of <HI>Protestants,</HI> in other Parts of it, yet it ap∣pears unto him little short of Desperate, when the Sublime and Obscure Doctrines of <HI>Predestina∣tion</HI> (wherein <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> themselves, were better agreed than their Followers,) come to be considered. However, even here also at last he takes Courage, and says, <HI>If ever there is to be a Better Condition of Mankind, and an Happier State of the World, it is not to be Expected, but from a serious and universal Practice of Christian PIETY.</HI> Let us then with a little Patience hear both Parties de∣clare themselves.</P>
<P>Say, Master <HI>Lutheran,</HI> What is the PIETY, for the maintaining whereof you so eagerly advance your <HI>Principles?</HI> His Answer is; <Q>I would not have the most <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Sin-hating</HI> Lord, Re∣proached as the <HI>Impeller</HI> of the <HI>Sin</HI> whereof he is the <HI>Revenger.</HI> I would not have our <HI>Merciful</HI> Father blasphemed, as dealing <HI>after an Illusory Manner</HI> with Men, when He invites them to His <HI>Mercy.</HI> I would not have any among the fallen Race of the <HI>First Adam,</HI> shut out from the just Hopes of <HI>Life</HI> in the <HI>Death</HI> of the <HI>Second A∣dam.</HI> I would not have <HI>Impenitent Unbeliever;</HI> cast upon GOD the <HI>Blame</HI> of their <HI>Impenitency;</HI> but the Wicked lay wholly <HI>on themselves</HI> the
<PB N="123" REF="002772_0074_0FE62F48B5046EF8"/>Fault of their own Destruction. I would have Men <HI>Work about their own Salvation,</HI> with a much Diligence and Vigilance, as if all turned upon their own <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> whether they shall be Saved or no.</Q> The pious <HI>Calvinist</HI> hears all this with Pleasure; and can say, <HI>My Brother, In all these Things my Heart is with you.</HI></P>
<P>But now, Master <HI>Calvinist,</HI> it is your Turn. Say, what is the PIETY, for the maintaining whereof you so eagerly Prefer your <HI>Principles?</HI> His Answer is; <Q>I would have our good GOD, forever adored, as the <HI>Original</HI> of all the <HI>Good,</HI> that we <HI>Have,</HI> or that we <HI>Do.</HI> If Men arrive to any Good <HI>Spiritual</HI> as well as <HI>Temporal,</HI> I would have our GOD praised for it; and I would have His <HI>Favours</HI> confessed as most <HI>Un∣merited</HI> by us in all our <HI>Praises.</HI> I would not ad∣mit the least Insinuation, as if the <HI>King Eternal,</HI> who is the <HI>Only Wise GOD,</HI> had not an Infallible <HI>Foreknowledge</HI> from all Eternity of whatever comes to pass in Time. I would have all that come unto <HI>Everlasting Life,</HI> to admire the <HI>Ever∣lasting Love</HI> of GOD unto them; and with Endless Admirations own, <HI>That their SAVIOUR has done more for them, than for others.</HI> I would have Men look up to GOD, with ardent <HI>Prayers</HI> for His Gracious, and Enlightening, and Sanc∣tifying Influences, and <HI>Pray</HI> unto Him as the <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> and the GOD who <HI>gives Re∣pentance,</HI> and Remember that <HI>Faith</HI> is the <HI>Gift of GOD.</HI> I would have Man to be very Humble, and humbly to Annihilate himself before the Glorious GOD, <HI>with whom there is terrible Majesty.</HI></Q>
<PB N="124" REF="002772_0075_0FE62F48B9BEA378"/>The pious <HI>Lutheran</HI> hears all this with Delight; and can say, <HI>My Brother, My Heart cannot but con∣cur with you, in such Things as these.</HI></P>
<P>At the same time, they both find that the seve∣ral <HI>Schemes,</HI> with which they would have this PI∣ETY served, are encumbred with <HI>Insuperable Diffi∣culties;</HI> and the <HI>Lutheran</HI> may have retorted upon him those very <HI>Difficulties</HI> which he thinks he sees the <HI>Calvinist</HI> overwhelmed withal. The old Law, <HI>Qui non vetat cum potest Jubet,</HI> Encumbers <HI>Armini∣us</HI> with as <HI>hard Consequences</HI> as he charges on <HI>Go∣marus. Maimonides</HI> will tell you, how much the <HI>Jewish</HI> World, and <HI>Cicero</HI> how much the <HI>Pagan,</HI> has been divided, in their Opinions, <HI>De Fato.</HI> Among the <HI>Papists,</HI> how do the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> and after these, the <HI>Jansenists,</HI> and their Opposites, keep <HI>in the dark, buffeting</HI> one another upon them? So that after all, Tis PIETY that must bring all to rights: and <HI>Melancthons</HI> Resolution; <HI>Officium agamus, et Disputationes de Predestinatione seponamus.</HI></P>
<P>The Experiment may be made on many other Doctrines, [Among which, I pray, take notice, you'l never find me mentioning the <HI>Damnable Heresies,</HI> of the <HI>Arian,</HI> and the <HI>Socinian!</HI>] wherein they that have the true <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD, and <HI>Love</HI> of CHRIST, may have their <HI>Differing Sentiments;</HI> — <HI>Incolumi semper Amicitia.</HI></P>
<P>Instead of my going on to do That, I rather pass now to say, That I would have you lay aside all Thoughts, of any <HI>Foundation</HI> for an <HI>Union</HI> a∣mong the Professors of Christianity, but what shall be in the <HI>Unity of the Spirit;</HI> or that Work of the Holy SPIRIT on the Hearts of Men, that
<PB N="125" REF="002772_0075_0FE62F48B9BEA378"/>inclines them to Glorify GOD with an <HI>Obedience</HI> to His Will revealed in His Word, and Glorify CHRIST with a <HI>Dependence</HI> on Him for all their Happiness; and <HI>Love their Neighbour as themselves. Other Foundation can no Man lay!</HI> All Attempts to build the <HI>Tower of Zion</HI> on any other Foundation, will come to nothing; You'l prosper no better in them, than they who go to build a <HI>Tower of Babel.</HI> But then, Let ALL that are by Visible PIETY qualified for it, find a due and a kind Reception with you. Let your <HI>Feet stand in a large Place,</HI> and, <HI>Add unto your Faith, Godliness, and unto your Godliness, Brotherly-kindness, and unto your Brotherly-kindness, Charity:</HI> And, Pay the Regards of <HI>Brethren in CHRIST,</HI> unto all those, who by owning and living the Everlasting MAXIMS of PIETY, may claim what the true Citizen of <HI>Zi∣on</HI> will yield unto <HI>them that Fear the Lord.</HI> Allow to, yea, Challenge for, this People, the <HI>Rights</HI> which belong unto them, and the <HI>Liberties</HI> with which the SON of GOD has <HI>made them free.</HI> The People, <HI>who Worship GOD in the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>who Rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS,</HI> and who <HI>have no Confidence in the Flesh,</HI> or, value not themselves up∣on a <HI>Religion</HI> which is nothing but <HI>Flesh,</HI> and ex∣teriour; THESE are the true <HI>People of GOD:</HI> The PEOPLE, which have the <HI>Promises</HI> in the Cove∣nant of GOD pertaining to them; and whereto the <HI>Kindnesses,</HI> or the <HI>Injuries</HI> that are done, are done unto their Glorious <HI>Head,</HI> in the Heavens. Be not such a <HI>Donatist,</HI> as to dream, that the <HI>Peo∣ple of GOD</HI> are no where to be found, but in <HI>One Party,</HI> which you have your greatest Esteem for. But, look for them, as to be found under various

<P>Challenge for this <HI>People,</HI> a Power to <HI>Associate,</HI> or form <HI>Assemblies</HI> for the Worship of GOD our SAVIOUR, according to the <HI>Directions</HI> which they apprehend his Gospel has given them. Chal∣lenge for the <HI>Societies</HI> of this People, the Power to elect their own <HI>Pastors;</HI> which was one of the <HI>Last Things</HI> lost in the Robberies which the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> committed on the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. Challenge for these <HI>particular Churches,</HI> the Rights of Sacred <HI>Corporations,</HI> that have all the Needful Power of <HI>Self-Preservation,</HI> and <HI>Self-Reformation:</HI> Yet obliged in Things of <HI>common Concern,</HI> so far to act in Conjunction with other Churches <HI>Walk∣ing in the Faith and Order of the Gospel,</HI> as to Con∣sult them, and be Directed and Restrained by them, on just Occasions.</P>
<P>For <HI>Communion</HI> in these Churches, and <HI>Admis∣sion</HI> to all the Priviledges and Advantages of the <HI>Evangelical Church-State,</HI> I would have you insist upon it, That no <HI>Terms</HI> be imposed, but such <HI>Ne∣cessary Things,</HI> as Heaven will require of all, who shall <HI>Ascend into the Hill of the Lord, and stand in His Holy Place.</HI> Be sure to stand by that <HI>Golden Rule, Receive ye one another, as CHRIST has received us unto the Glory of GOD;</HI> That is to say, Those of whom it is our Duty to <HI>Judge,</HI> that our SAVI∣OUR will <HI>Receive them to His Glory</HI> in the Heaven∣ly

Churches that will keep up <HI>Instruments of Separation,</HI> which will keep out those that have the Evident <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Claims</HI> of them that are <HI>One with CHRIST</HI> upon them, are in Reality but <HI>Combinations</HI> of Men, who under Pretence of <HI>Religion,</HI> are pursuing some <HI>Carnal In∣terests.</HI> Their <HI>Diana</HI> is very <HI>Visible!</HI> Tis a Com∣plicated <HI>Profanity</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> that these <HI>Churches</HI> are to stand indicted for. It is to be lamented, That more <HI>Churches</HI> than <HI>One</HI> have the Guilt of a very sinful <HI>Schism</HI> to be charged upon them, for their Chasing from their <HI>Communion,</HI> and the an∣nexed <HI>Encouragements</HI> and <HI>Emoluments,</HI> many of the <HI>Righteous Nation,</HI> which have the <HI>Gates of Heaven</HI> standing <HI>open</HI> for them: and yet such is the <HI>Mystery of Iniquity,</HI> that at the same time they make Out∣cries of <HI>Schism,</HI> against the Consciencious People,
<PB N="128" REF="002772_0077_0FE62F4BF65C0018"/>for keeping out, while they violently shut the Doors upon them. Yea, There has been <HI>One Church</HI> [Tho' <HI>I have never heard of but One!</HI>] which has punished and even destroyed Multi∣tudes of Godly Men, for not Conforming to things which the <HI>Imposers</HI> themselves have confessed <HI>Indifferent.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, I have said enough, to disengage you from all <HI>Schismatical Combinations,</HI> and Intimate the <HI>Catholic Spirit,</HI> which I would have to be ex∣ercised, in the whole Progress of your Ministry. <HI>Cath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licism without Popery,</HI> is the Title of an Essay, which therefore I particularly commend unto a Perusal with you.</P>
<P>Finally. As it must be the Grand Aim of your Ministry, to propagate the PIETY of the <HI>Ever∣lasting Gospel;</HI> And tho' vain Men may boast what they will of this or that being the <HI>Best con∣stituted Church in the World,</HI> and celebrate their own <HI>Admirable Constitution,</HI> yet that should be esteemed by you the <HI>Best constituted Church,</HI> in which the PIETY of the Grand <HI>Evangelical Maxims,</HI> is most Animated and Exhibited; and <HI>That</HI> the <HI>Best Con∣stitution,</HI> which is most calculated for the <HI>Cultiva∣tion</HI> of this Indisputable PIETY: So, I would have you go forth to it, under a strong Tincture of this Apprehension, <HI>That a Church which makes the Terms of Communion very different from the Terms of Salvation, and excludes from any Means of Salvati∣on, or from any due Expressions of Brotherly-kindness, those whom it is a Duty to acknowledge as Brethren in CHRIST, is guilty of an Iniquity, against which all Good Men ought to hear a Testimony.</HI></P>

There are Concurring with you, Hundreds of Thousands of Generous Minds, in which this Ap∣prehension lies now shut up as an <HI>Aurum Fulmi∣nans:</HI> But it will break forth more and more, <HI>As the Day approaches,</HI> and as Men improve in <HI>Manly Religion,</HI> in Explosions that will carry all before it: And the Mean, Little, Narrow Souls, that know no <HI>Religion,</HI> but that of a <HI>Party,</HI> and their <HI>Secular Interest,</HI> will become deserted Objects for the <HI>Disdain</HI> and <HI>Pity,</HI> of them who have taken the <HI>Way that is above them.</HI> I hope, You will do all you can, to <HI>strengthen your Brethren,</HI> as GOD shall give you, [<HI>And may He give you!</HI>] Opportunities.</P>
<P>To have done: My Concern to see you a <HI>Divine of the Right Stamp,</HI> will not permit me to conclude, without One little peece of <HI>Over-weight</HI> added unto the Advice that has been given you.</P>
<P>Having established your self in <HI>Sound Theology,</HI> by Reading such <HI>Systemes</HI> as I have already told you of; unto which, I cannot but now tell you, an admirable <HI>Turretine</HI> should be annexed, as one hardly to be equalled; Nor is, <HI>Cocceius de Faedere,</HI> to be omitted: [If I said nothing of <HI>P.

<P>§ 19 I have yet more to do; I may not leave you, till I leave a few RULES OF HEALTH with you; which I shall do with the utmost Bre∣vity.</P>
<P>Having first encouraged you to cultivate an in∣timate Acquaintance with some Wise and Good <HI>Physician,</HI> who may have the continual <HI>Inspection of your Health,</HI> in your Friendly Conversation with him, I will defend you with the ensuing Admo∣nitions.</P>
<P N="1">I. The most Acute Physicians, find themselves compelled, with our <HI>Cheyne,</HI> unto this General Direction. The <HI>Grand Secret</HI> and <HI>Sole Method</HI> for <HI>Long Life,</HI> and so for the <HI>Health</HI> which will be∣friend and sweeten it, is, To keep the <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Juices</HI> in a State of due <HI>Fluidity.</HI> And nothing will do this, but keeping much to a <HI>Spare, Lean, Fluid</HI> sort of a <HI>Diet.</HI> All who <HI>live long,</HI> and with∣out much <HI>Pain,</HI> and after such a Life at length <HI>Die easily,</HI> are such as Live <HI>Abstemiously.</HI></P>

II. <HI>Borellus</HI> has a Remark on many Students falling into a <HI>Consumption,</HI> That it often proceeds, <HI>A Fumo candelarum hausto in Musaeis undi{que} Clau∣sis.</HI></P>
<P>You will undergo the less of this Hazard, if you mind the Report of <HI>Manlius; Ego multos Periculosos Morbos et Miserias hujus Corpusculi mei Vito, hac unica Ratione, quod semper utor Diligentia, cito eundi cubitum.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Medicina Gymnastica</HI> has done Mira∣culous Things. <HI>Bodily Exercise profits;</HI> But no <HI>Exercise</HI> comparable to that of <HI>moderate Riding;</HI> whereof, the Reason why we find no more in the Prescriptions of the Ancients, (tho' <HI>Galen</HI> has a Chapter about it) for the Recovery of the Feeble, is because they were so simple as to <HI>Ride without Stirrups.</HI> The <HI>Saddle</HI> is the <HI>Seat of Health.</HI> As for the <HI>Games,</HI> which Exercise the <HI>Spirit</HI> and not the <HI>Body,</HI> particularly, the Noble and Ancient Game of <HI>Chess;</HI> These are by no Means proper for a <HI>Student.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. 'Tis an Observation of that Great Man, the Lord <HI>Verulam, Nihil magis conducit ad Sanita∣tem et Longaevitatem, quam Crebrae et Domesticae Pur∣gationes.</HI> A <HI>Family-Purge</HI> now and then taken, may be of Service to you. <HI>Pillulae Ruffi,</HI> especial∣ly when Chalybeated with adding about a third part of <HI>Sal Martis:</HI> Or else; A Bottle of <HI>Anniseed Water,</HI> with a <HI>Dram</HI> or two of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> steeped in it; These you may conveniently have always at hand for this Purpose.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Vander Heidan,</HI> has not related an hundredth part of the Vertues, in <HI>Cold Water.</HI> I tender you the Advice which the Aged Servant of GOD gave to his Valued Son, <HI>Drink not only Water; but
<PB N="132" REF="002772_0079_0FE62F5A8C8CC0D8"/>use a little Wine for thy Stomachs sake.</HI> And yet I would say, upon Drinking a Glass of Generous <HI>Wine,</HI> often take a Glass of <HI>Water.</HI> And if the <HI>Beer</HI> they bring you, be too <HI>Strong,</HI> dilute it with put∣ting a sufficient Quantity of <HI>Water</HI> into it. But never take <HI>Water,</HI> or any thing else, <HI>Cold,</HI> when you are <HI>Hot</HI> with Labour. There is <HI>Death in the Pot.</HI></P>
<P>When you have run the hazard of disturbing your <HI>Stomach,</HI> with Ingurgitations from a Full Table, a Draught of <HI>Cold Water,</HI> will do <HI>Good like a Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>Going to Bed, and Sweating from a large Draught of <HI>Cold Water,</HI> not only stops and cures a <HI>Cold,</HI> but also often extinguishes a <HI>Fever</HI> at the Beginning.</P>
<P>Daily to wash your Head and Mouth with <HI>Cold Water,</HI> is a Practice that cannot be too much commended; If it were only for saving you from the <HI>Toothache.</HI></P>
<P>For a Frequency in the Use of the <HI>Liquors,</HI> which they call <HI>Spirits,</HI> be as afraid of it, as you would be of a Familiarity with <HI>Evil Spirits.</HI></P>

Indeed, if less <HI>Flesh</HI> were eaten, and more of the <HI>Vegetable</HI> and <HI>Farinaceous</HI> Food were used, it were better.

VIII. <HI>Shall I smoke Tobacco?</HI> Answer; Be sure <HI>Not,</HI> if I can help it. Or let <HI>Alsted</HI> answer for me. <HI>Maximus Tabaci Abusus est, quotidiano ejus usu, se∣metipsos, et bonas Horas perdere, et ex cerebro, mentis nobilissima sede, caminum et cloacam efficere.</HI> In the Dutchy of <HI>Berguen,</HI> People may not <HI>Smoke,</HI> with∣out purchasing a <HI>License</HI> for it. If you were to purchase of me a <HI>License</HI> for it, I know not how high Terms I should hold you to. If you want an <HI>Hydragogue,</HI> there is one preferrible in chewing some such Thing as a bit of <HI>Mastich;</HI> which would also whiten your <HI>Teeth,</HI> and sweeten your <HI>Breath,</HI> which <HI>Tobacco</HI> poisons. If once you get into the way of <HI>Smoking,</HI> there will be extreme hazard, of your becoming a <HI>Slave</HI> to the <HI>Pipe;</HI> and ever <HI>Insatiably craving</HI> for it. People may think what they will; But such a <HI>Slavery,</HI> is much be∣low the Dignity of a <HI>Rational Creature;</HI> and much more of a <HI>Gracious Christian.</HI> I am sure, what the Great <HI>Voetius</HI> writes upon it, is very true; <HI>Minime convenit viris honest is et gravibus; nominatim Mini∣stris et Ministerii Candidatis.</HI> There can be no <HI>Apo∣logy</HI> for your taking up the <HI>slovenly Practice,</HI> and the Pains that must be taken to conquer the <HI>Poison,</HI> if you are not well advised and assured, <HI>That your Health requires it.</HI> But I shall only recite what you will find in Two very considerable Writers, that you may form the better Judgment upon it. The One of these Writers is <HI>Magnenus;</HI> who tho' he be a mighty Friend to the Use of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> yet acknowledges, <Q>That it is not easy to relate, what are the <HI>Damages,</HI> which the In∣ordinate and Immoderate Use of this <HI>Fume</HI> does bring with it; for besides the insatiable and
<PB N="134" REF="002772_0080_0FE62EECE18B8A28"/>greedy Lust of taking it, by its <HI>daily Use,</HI> the <HI>Memory</HI> is impaired, the <HI>Stomach</HI> violated, the <HI>Brain</HI> exiccated, and the <HI>Life</HI> shortened; and the <HI>Offspring</HI> damnified.</Q> Yea, he lays this down as an undoubted Assertion; <HI>That the frequent and fa∣miliar Use of it, can be good for no Man.</HI> The Other is our <HI>Gale,</HI> who from his own Experience taxes the Smoke of <HI>Tobacco</HI> with very <HI>Noxious Qualities:</HI> He says, <Q>He found it <HI>made</HI> more Humours than it brought away; and tho' it <HI>opened</HI> his Body for the present, it proved in that very thing a Pre∣judice afterwards; and Nature was but the more Sluggish and Feeble anon, for the <HI>Force</HI> in this way put upon it.</Q> He says, At last <HI>I came under a fixed Resolution to deliver my self from this Vassalage; And this I account not the least Deliverance of my Life.</HI> And yet, after all, I am not so <HI>Inflexibly sett,</HI> as utterly to deny you the Use of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> if you are sure of any <HI>Benefit</HI> from it. Only I insist up∣on it, That you be, [If I may use a <HI>Phrase,</HI> that if it may seem to trespass upon <HI>Good Sense,</HI> it shall yet have as much as the <HI>Thing</HI> I write against] <HI>Excessively Moderate</HI> in it. And if you are growing so Wise as to Retrench and Reform any <HI>Intempe∣rance</HI> in it, which you may have been unawares drawn into, do it not <HI>at Once,</HI> but <HI>by Degrees,</HI> lest by too quick a stop to an <HI>usual Discharge,</HI> your <HI>Health</HI> may be endangered. But, upon the whole; If you have hitherto escaped this <HI>Epidemical Con∣tagion,</HI> and are not yet a settled Inhabitant of the <HI>Terra del Fuogo,</HI> I cannot advise you in better Terms than those; <HI>It is Good for you to abide even as you are;</HI> And, <HI>If you may be kept free, chuse it ra∣ther.</HI> Yea, <HI>My Son, If</HI> Smokers <HI>entice thee, consent
<PB N="135" REF="002772_0080_0FE62EECE18B8A28"/>thou not.</HI> It is good Advice; and if you take it, you will one Day Thank him that gave it.</P>
<P>But if I am against your taking <HI>Tobacco</HI> in <HI>Smoke,</HI> you may be sure, I shall not approve your taking it in <HI>Snuff.</HI> How <HI>shameful</HI> a thing it is, for <HI>People of Reason</HI> to confess, that they can't live easily half an Hour together, without a <HI>Delight</HI> so Sensual, so Trivial, so very Contemptible, as that of <HI>Tickling their Olfactory Nerves</HI> a little? And even <HI>bury</HI> themselves alive, in <HI>pungent Grains of titilla∣ting Dust?</HI> A Learned Physician of the <HI>French</HI> Na∣tion, will tell you, how many Diseases of the <HI>Genus Nervosum,</HI> do issue out of that <HI>Pandora's Box,</HI> from whence the Pinch of <HI>Snuff</HI> is taken. A <HI>Quincy</HI> will tell you, how wretchedly it <HI>spoils the Appetite.</HI> And a <HI>Cheyne</HI> will tell you, how much the <HI>Eyes</HI> as well as the <HI>Stomach</HI> fare the worse for it. You may dream, that the Passage thro' the <HI>Os Cribri∣forme</HI> will not permit the <HI>Gross Powder</HI> of your <HI>Snuff</HI> to enter into your <HI>Brain;</HI> yet some very thin and fine Parts of it will find their way thither. And what Mischiefs must needs follow a <HI>Brain</HI> so poisoned? Nay, One would think, that the great <HI>Snuff-takers</HI> had their Brain already touch'd; or they could not be so obstinately and incurably at∣tach'd unto an <HI>Evil Habit,</HI> which their Folly has brought upon them. A very just Motto for the <HI>Snuff-box</HI> might be, A LEADER TO THE COFFIN. If it be offer'd you, <HI>Away with it!</HI> I say again, <HI>Away with it!</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. A Knight of my Acquaintance visiting the famous Dr. <HI>Lower,</HI> in his last Sickness, ask'd him for the best Advice he could give him, <HI>How to

The Doctor thereupon only repeted his Answer; <HI>Why, Didn't I tell you; Don't eat too much!</HI>— And, <HI>further said not.</HI> Sr. <HI>Theodore Mayern</HI> on his Death-bed gave this Advice to a Noble Friend, that ask'd his Counsil for the pro∣servation of of his Health. <HI>Be moderate in your Diet; Use much Exercise, and little Physic.</HI> I would have added, <HI>Guard against injurious Changes of the Wea∣ther; and especially be exposed unto the Night-Airs as little as may be.</HI></P>

<P>20. I have now no more to do; but only single out a Few RULES OF PRUDENCE, the Ob∣servation whereof may be your Preservation from very many Wrong Steps, in the Way you have
<PB N="137" REF="002772_0081_0FE62F5BA9835D78"/>now before you. It cost the <HI>Prussians,</HI> the Trou∣ble of a <HI>War,</HI> before they could oblige their Neigh∣bours, to call them no longer <HI>Brutos,</HI> which they did before the Tenth Century, but, <HI>Prusses,</HI> which signifies, it seems, <HI>A Prudent People.</HI> I wish it may cost you no more Trouble, than only a little <HI>Rea∣ding</HI> of, and <HI>Thinking</HI> on, certain <HI>Maxims of Pru∣dence</HI> to render you one of that People. I shall not say, how much it has <HI>cost</HI> me, and what a <HI>Dear-bought Experience</HI> it is, that has enabled me to recommend them.</P>
<P>I will first suppose, That you take that Course of PIETY, <HI>If any lack Wisdom, let him ask it of GOD:</HI> And, That you study the Book of <HI>The PROVERBS,</HI> which our Bible is enriched withal. I will also wish you to read, the Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> his <HI>Essays.</HI> And I will mind you, That one has lately written a Book, to show, <HI>That Wisdom lies in the not doing that which may any way prejudice Hu∣mane Society, of which we are a part, but on the con∣trary make all our Actions tend to the Benefit of it.</HI> Then, I will offer you such <HI>Hints</HI> as these.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Italian</HI> Maxims are no <HI>Imprudent</HI> ones. One must not <HI>Spend all he hath;</HI> nor <HI>Do all he can;</HI> nor <HI>Tell all he knows;</HI> nor <HI>Believe all he hears.</HI></P>
<P>And there is a Sentence of a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, wor∣thy to be remembred with you; which in plain <HI>English</HI> will tell you, <HI>No wise Man will be taken a second Time, in an Error he hath suffered for.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. It is a Lesson worth more than an Ingott of Gold, which one who <HI>saw many Things,</HI> has left, for what is to be uttered in Company; <HI>Bis prius ad Limam quam semel ad Linguam. Think</HI> be∣fore
<PB N="138" REF="002772_0082_0FE62F694AFA8048"/>you <HI>Speak; Think</HI> before <HI>whom</HI> you Speak; Think <HI>why</HI> as well as <HI>what</HI> you Speak. And Re∣member, <HI>In multiloquio Stultiloquium;</HI> And, <HI>Least said soonest mended.</HI></P>
<P>It is a very prudent Remark; If one observes these Three small Imperatives, <HI>Audi, Cerne, Tace,</HI> he will need no other Passport for Travelling o∣ver the World. You will have a good Note of Wisdom, with two <HI>Satellits</HI> to it, in my reciting to you the Observations of a very Discrete Man, who said; <HI>He had often got hurt by by eating too much; rarely, by eating too little; Often got hurt by wearing too few Cloaths; rarely, by wearing too many: Of∣ten got hurt by Speaking; rarely, by holding his Tongue.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. You find <HI>Homer</HI> assigning That as the Rea∣son, which made his <HI>Patroclus</HI> to be <HI>Universally Lamented</HI> at his Death, <HI>He knew how to be Good∣natured unto all Men.</HI> You may come to be almost <HI>Universally Beloved</HI> while you Live, if your <HI>Good Nature,</HI> [and <HI>Good Humour;</HI> what no Nation or Language but ours, has a proper Term for!] ap∣pear in continual Demonstrations, which will sa∣tisfy every one; That you shall <HI>Delight</HI> in doing all <HI>Good Offices</HI> which they can <HI>Desire</HI> of you; and, That if you see or hear any thing <HI>Disreputable</HI> in them, you will generously cast and keep a <HI>Mantle</HI> over it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I have heard one say, That there was a Gentleman in the <HI>Nineteenth Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Acts,</HI> to whom he was more endebted, than to any Man in the World. This was he, whom our Tran∣slation calls the <HI>Town-Clerk</HI> of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> whose Counsil it was, <HI>To do nothing Rashly.</HI> Upon any
<PB N="139" REF="002772_0082_0FE62F694AFA8048"/>Proposal of Consequence, it was an usual Speech with him, <HI>We'l first advise with the Town-Clerk of</HI> Ephesus. One in a fond Compliance with a Friend, forgetting the <HI>Town-Clerk,</HI> may do that <HI>in Haste,</HI> which he may <HI>Repent at Leisure;</HI> may do what may cost him several <HI>Hundreds</HI> of Pounds, besides Troubles which he would not have under∣gone for <HI>Thousands.</HI></P>

Let the Judges Motto be yours, <HI>Prudens qui Patiens.</HI> You will for ever find, <HI>The Wrath of Man works not the Righteousness of God.</HI> And, <HI>There is nothing done so well in a Passion, but what may be done better out of it.</HI> There is a Conspicuous <HI>Wisdom</HI> in <HI>Meekness.</HI> If you find your <HI>Spirit heated</HI> in Discourse at any Time, <HI>Now, Now,</HI> is a Time for the <HI>Bridle; I will take heed to my Ways, that I Sin not with my Tongue.</HI> There is Danger lest a <HI>Moses</HI> himself <HI>Speak unadvisedly with his Lips,</HI> when his <HI>Anger</HI> is moved. <HI>Suppress</HI> rather than <HI>Express</HI> too warm <HI>Resentments,</HI> whatever be the <HI>Provocati∣ons.</HI> There will be nothing lost by doing so. —<HI>Motos praestat componere fluctus.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. If you feel a <HI>Violent Impulse</HI> hurrying you into an eager pursuit of any Matter, be Jealous, be Afraid, lest you be <HI>led into Temptation.</HI> Examine it over and over again; and be upon a most sedate weigh∣ing of the Matter, well-assured, <HI>That it is what will not be Repented of.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Let it be as a <HI>Law of the Medes and Per∣sians</HI> with you, <HI>That you will never sacrifice any Hours of a short Life,</HI> in <HI>Contentions:</HI> Especially in <HI>Perso∣nal</HI> Contentions, and Quarrels and Squabbles, and <HI>Vitilitigations. Abundance</HI> of Sin will be unavoid∣ably committed in them; And, <HI>The Game will not
<PB N="140" REF="002772_0083_0FE62F694F857ED8"/>pay for the Candle. Remit</HI> rather of much <HI>Right,</HI> which you may have a Claim unto, than <HI>Contend</HI> for it. This is the meaning of, <HI>Let your Moderation be known unto all Men.</HI> In using an uncommon Lenity and Forbearance, and <HI>Condescension,</HI> under unfair Usages, you will find, <HI>The Lord u at hand;</HI> Ready in strange Ways to make you <HI>Reparation</HI> for the <HI>Wrongs</HI> that <HI>Men</HI> may have done you. Yea, Why may you not look on the <HI>Peace</HI> you purchase by it, as a sufficient <HI>Reparation?</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. Sometimes a <HI>Vindication</HI> may be necessa∣ry. In what Cases— <HI>Wisdom will be profitable to direct you.</HI> But, if it be at any Time <HI>whispered</HI> unto you, that any one has <HI>Despised</HI> you, <HI>Derided</HI> you, spoken <HI>Diminutively</HI> of you; the Best way, <HI>for the most part,</HI> is, For you to take no more No∣tice of it, than a greater Man [a <HI>Theodosius</HI>] would have done of such a Contempt cast upon him. Let them that have abused you, <HI>know nothing</HI> that you <HI>know any thing</HI> of the matter. For such is the <HI>Baseness</HI> of many People, that (measuring <HI>you</HI> by themselves) they will <HI>hate</HI> you, because you <HI>know</HI> that they have <HI>hurt</HI> you; and they will per∣sist in their <HI>Hatred,</HI> which they must Justify, be∣cause they imagine, that you <HI>can't Forgive</HI> them. Whereas, If you be <HI>Silent,</HI> and <HI>as one that hears not,</HI> GOD will probably Reward your <HI>Patient Silence,</HI> by making those very Persons anon prove some of the most cordial and useful Friends you have in the World.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Don't Use your <HI>Pen,</HI> and Lose your <HI>Time,</HI> in <HI>Eristic Writings,</HI> any more than unquestionable <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> makes to be absolutely Necessa∣ry. Writing upon a Point, and in the Way and
<PB N="141" REF="002772_0083_0FE62F694F857ED8"/>Strain of <HI>Controversy,</HI> will not only have a Ten∣dency to discompose the <HI>Peace</HI> of your Mind, but miserably Divert the <HI>Studies</HI> of a short Pilgrimage, from such things as would be much more Profi∣table for your self and others. Anon, the <HI>Grand Point</HI> of the <HI>Controversy</HI> will be, only <HI>Who has most Wit or Grace of the Two,</HI> you, or your Antagonist. <HI>A mighty Business!</HI> If <HI>Jerom</HI> were pleased in an Hectoring way to forewarn his Opponents, that he was, <HI>Cornuta Bestia;</HI> I hope <HI>you</HI> won't be so.</P>
<P N="10">X. If Calumnious <HI>Quills</HI> have publickly scratch'd you,— <HI>An Respondendum semper Calumniis?</HI> — No. Look as far back as Two Thousand Years ago, and you will find even a <HI>Plato</HI> giving a Pattern to a Christian, in his declining to take any Notice of the Invectives which a <HI>Xenophon</HI> had used upon him. — It may be, the <HI>Scribblers,</HI> are sorry <HI>Scoun∣drels,</HI> and such vile <HI>Children of Sheth,</HI> as it is be∣neath you to let them know that you have so much as read their Follies. — Or be they what they will, <HI>for the most part,</HI> the best way will be to, <HI>Shine on,</HI> Regardless of what the <HI>Batts</HI> and <HI>Owls</HI> may mutter against you. Or, if that Metaphor be too <HI>Sublime,</HI> let me say, At least <HI>As the Moon a∣mong the lesser Fires,</HI> keep a steddy Pace, <HI>Walking in your Brightness,</HI> notwithstanding the unregardable Allatrations of your Adversaries. If they perse∣cute you with <HI>Libels,</HI> 'tis a notable Hint, that <HI>Le Clero</HI> has given you. Instead of answering them, write such learned and useful <HI>Books,</HI> as will be of <HI>perpetual Service</HI> to Mankind. These will procure such a casting and lasting <HI>Testimony</HI> for you, that there will need no more to make a Man ill tho't of, than this; That he was a <HI>Thersites</HI> to <HI>you,</HI> and
<PB N="142" REF="002772_0084_0FE62F6A55B66920"/>one that wrote against you. These <HI>Books</HI> will be durable Monuments of your Valuable and Ho∣nourable Character, when the Libels of these poor <HI>Animalculicuncles</HI> will perish among the <HI>Wast-Paper,</HI> which the <HI>Haberdashers of small Wares</HI> have occasi∣on for.</P>
<P>And if any <HI>Preacher</HI> should be so impertinent as to have any Girds at you in the Pulpit, remember the Advice of the sweet-spirited <HI>Melancthon</HI> to <HI>Vitus Theodorus,</HI> when the hot-spirited <HI>Osiander</HI> had preached against him; <HI>I charge you, Don't Answer the Man; Hold your Peace; Go on in your Ministry as if you had heard nothing!</HI>— The Gentleman soon found his Account in hearkening to his <HI>Can∣did</HI> Adviser.</P>
<P>That what I am driving may stick, you shall have it in the Form of two old Rusty Nails; The One, <HI>Magnum Contumeliae Remedium Negligen∣tia;</HI> The other, <HI>Sile, et funestam dedisti Plagam.</HI></P>
<P>As wicked a Fellow as ever polluted a Pen, yet has this Passage worth transcribing from him, while his Name is not worth mentioning. <Q>The Malice of <HI>Ill Tongues</HI> cast upon a <HI>Good Man,</HI> is only like a Mouthful of <HI>Smoke,</HI> blown upon a <HI>Diamond,</HI> which tho' it clouds its Beauty for the present, yet it is easily rubb'd off, and the Gem restored with little Trouble to its Genuine Lustre.</Q> But an <HI>Honester Pagan</HI> than he, has told you, <HI>Perditi Hominis profligatique Maledictis, nullius Gloria dignitas{que} Violatur.</HI> Old <HI>Cicero</HI> tells you so.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Be <HI>Sociable.</HI> But throw away as little <HI>Time</HI> as ever you can, upon the <HI>Temporis Fures;</HI> especial∣ly
<PB N="143" REF="002772_0084_0FE62F6A55B66920"/>upon <HI>Impertinent Company.</HI> Keep <HI>Company;</HI> but let it be chiefly with such as are your <HI>Superiours;</HI> your <HI>Familiarity</HI> with whom, will be Reputable and Serviceable to you.</P>
<P N="12">XII. While you are yet in your <HI>Younger Years,</HI> be always furnished with a Stock of Weighty and Useful <HI>Questions.</HI> By wisely and humbly offering These, and with the Modesty of One desiring to be Instructed, you may commonly <HI>lead</HI> the Con∣versation, even with your Superiours, &amp; almost ne∣cessitate a <HI>Profitable Conversation.</HI> You may be, as R. <HI>Jeremy</HI> was called, <HI>The Master of the Questions.</HI> A <HI>Discretion</HI> in this point, is a distinguishing Thing. But whenever you are <HI>Arguing,</HI> ordinarily propose every Thing rather <HI>Socratically</HI> than <HI>Dogmatically.</HI> Be not <HI>Positive;</HI> much less <HI>Clamorous;</HI> least of all <HI>Furious.</HI> But keep up an Air of <HI>Modesty,</HI> and car∣ry on your Discourse, in the form of proper <HI>Ques∣tions;</HI> and as one willing to be <HI>instructed</HI> by him whom you are disputing with. 'Tis an <HI>Excellent Wisdom,</HI> this; To <HI>Argue Handsomely.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. Find out some very <HI>Wise,</HI> and some very <HI>Good</HI> Person, whom you may chuse to make, what we call, <HI>A Bosom Friend.</HI> But be very care∣ful of your <HI>Choice;</HI> For, <HI>A Faithful Friend, who can find?</HI> When you have such an One, ask his Ad∣vice in all Matters of Importance. Nevertheless, even here, keep your Stops, as to trusting him, with such <HI>Secrets</HI> as may put it into his Power to <HI>Hurt</HI> you. At least, rarely commit any <HI>Secrets</HI> to any Persons, but such as may have it as much
<PB N="144" REF="002772_0085_0FE62F6A59F20B48"/>for <HI>Their</HI> Interest as it is for <HI>Yours,</HI> to keep them <HI>so.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>Lay Hands suddenly on no Man!</HI> — There is in the <HI>Wisdom of the Ancients,</HI> a Caution against, <HI>Blessing a Friend with a loud Voice, Rising early in the Morning.</HI> There is a marvellous <HI>Wisdom</HI> as well as <HI>Goodness,</HI> in <HI>speaking Well</HI> of every One, as far as we can, on all Occasions, and even watch∣ing for all Occasions to do so. And <HI>Evil speak∣ing</HI> has an <HI>Indiscretion</HI> as well as <HI>Indecency</HI> in it; for the very <HI>Birds of the Air</HI> strangely <HI>report the Mat∣ter.</HI> But yet there is often a Want of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> in our being either too <HI>Copious,</HI> or too <HI>Early</HI> in our <HI>Commendations:</HI> Too <HI>High,</HI> or too <HI>Quick.</HI> You may sooner than you think for, see your <HI>Commen∣dations</HI> Consuted; and be obliged [as even <HI>Calvin</HI> once,] to Revoke your <HI>Dedications.</HI></P>
<Q>Qualem commendes etiam at{que} etiam aspice.</Q>
<P N="15">XV. Let no <HI>Man of Quality</HI> engage you, and attach you so far to his Interests, that you shall run the hazard of Abating the Success of your Ministry, and Abridging your Opportunities to <HI>Do Good unto many,</HI> upon <HI>his</HI> Account. You will find such Men, what the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD foretell you shall, when you <HI>put your Trust in them.</HI> They will soon fall out with you, if you don't keep Touch with them, in all their Designs; and when you cease to be their <HI>Tool,</HI> they will most <HI>Forget∣fully</HI> and <HI>Ungratefully</HI> abandon you. Nor will it be Wisdom in you, to go any further in appear∣ing
<PB N="145" REF="002772_0085_0FE62F6A59F20B48"/>for any <HI>Government, [As the World now goes!</HI>] than <HI>Duty</HI> calls you to it.— If you do,— I can tell, <HI>How you shall be Requited for it!</HI> If any <HI>Factions</HI> arising in the <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> sollicit your Imbarcation in them, keep close to the Business of your <HI>Ministry,</HI> and say, <HI>I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down; Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?</HI> To be a <HI>State-Martyr,</HI>— 'tis what I can't advise you to be ambitious of. I have nothing to say, for such a <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Martyrdom.</HI> Yet thus much I insist upon. Besure to keep forever Loyal and Faithful to the <HI>Protestant Line,</HI> for the British Scepter.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. <HI>Gain by every Thing!</HI> Let <HI>Reproaches</HI> make you consider, <HI>To what Excellent Vertue and Action, would He that has bidden this to befal me, thereby Awaken me?</HI> Yea, Let all <HI>Disasters</HI> make you consider, <HI>What Admonition does my GOD now send unto me?</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. If you have laid up an Inexhaustible Store of <HI>Stories,</HI> accommodated unto all the Pur∣poses of the <HI>Profitable</HI> and the <HI>Agreeable,</HI> and have the Skill of <HI>telling</HI> them <HI>Handsomely,</HI> and with a <HI>Deliberate, Expressive, Unstumbling Brevity,</HI> and pro∣duce them on many Occasions, you may not only <HI>Ingratiate</HI> yourself wherever you make your Appearance, but also obtain almost any <HI>Request</HI> that you shall make one of <HI>them</HI> a <HI>witty Introducti∣on</HI> to. The <HI>Precious Stones</HI> that every one sets a Value on, are called, <HI>Pleasant Stones.</HI> But let not your <HI>Pleasancy,</HI> degenerate into any unbecoming <HI>Levity.</HI> Forever so <HI>Regulate</HI> it, and so <HI>Moderate</HI> it, that it may <HI>Gracefully Terminate</HI> in the most <HI>Serious
<PB N="146" REF="002772_0086_0FE62F7394ADF5E8"/>Discourse,</HI> and if it may be, in the Inculcation and Insinuation of some <HI>serious Maxim,</HI> which may be <HI>Good for the Use of Edifying.</HI></P>
<P N="18">XVIII. In <HI>Publick Transactions,</HI> and especially when any thing is driving, about which the Peo∣ple of GOD may be divided in their Sentiments, let there be a continual <HI>Terror of GOD</HI> upon you, lest you unawares fall in with something that may be <HI>Inimical</HI> or <HI>Detrimental</HI> to the Kingdom of GOD: Continually suspicious, lest some <HI>Strata∣gem of Satan</HI> may draw you into something that may gratify that <HI>Great Adversary.</HI> For Example; Things may look very <HI>plausibly,</HI> and there may seem a laudable Regard paid unto <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> in them; and yet it may be a <HI>prosti∣tuted Charity,</HI> which going so far as to embrace those for <HI>Brethren in CHRIST,</HI> who are <HI>Enemies</HI> to Him, it may prove a <HI>Treachery</HI> to the <HI>most Glorious Cause in the World.</HI> And so, there was once in the <HI>Low Countrys,</HI> that press'd under the Name of <HI>Moderation,</HI> which others found and call'd, <HI>Mnr∣deration.</HI></P>
<P>Be very <HI>Thoughtful,</HI> and very <HI>Prayerful</HI> on such Occasions.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. It may not be amiss for you to have <HI>Two Heaps.</HI> An <HI>Heap</HI> of UNINTELLIGIBLES; and an <HI>Heap</HI> of INCURABLES. Ever now and then you will meet with something or other, that may pretty much distress your Thoughts; But the <HI>shortest Way</HI> with the Vexations will be, <HI>To
<PB N="147" REF="002772_0086_0FE62F7394ADF5E8"/>throw them into the Heap they belong to,</HI> and be no more distress'd about them.</P>
<P>You will meet with some <HI>Unaccountable</HI> and <HI>In∣comprehensible</HI> Things; particularly, in the <HI>Conduct</HI> of many People. Throw them into your <HI>Heap of Unintelligibles;</HI> leave them there. Trouble your Mind no further; <HI>Hope the Best,</HI> or <HI>Think no more</HI> about them.</P>
<P>You will meet with some <HI>Unperswadeable</HI> Peo∣ple; No Counsel, no Reason will do any Thing upon the <HI>Obstinates:</HI> Especially, as to the making of due <HI>Submissions</HI> upon Offences. Throw them into the <HI>Heap of Incureables.</HI> Leave them there. And so do you go on to <HI>do as well as you can,</HI> what you have to do. Let not the <HI>Crooked Things that can't be made streight,</HI> encumber you</P>
<P N="20">XX. 'Tis a Trespass on the <HI>Rules of Prudence,</HI> never to know, <HI>when to have done.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>I have done!</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Go thy Way,</HI> O thou SON <HI>Greatly Beloved;</HI> and Work <HI>in thy Lot</HI> Livelily, and Pray∣erfully, and Cheerfully to the <HI>End</HI> of thy <HI>Days;</HI> And <HI>Wait</HI> and Look for what the Glorious LORD will do for thee <HI>at the End of thy Days;</HI> in those <HI>Endless Joys,</HI> wherein thou shalt <HI>shine as the Bright∣ness of the Firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever.</HI></P>
