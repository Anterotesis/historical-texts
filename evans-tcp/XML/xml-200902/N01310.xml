<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in <HI>Compliance</HI> with the Desire of an Honourable Friend that I <HI>Wrote</HI> both, &amp; <HI>Preach'd</HI> One, of those ESSAYS which I now present unto his, and the Publick Acceptance. I did it from a perfect Concurrence I had with him, and ma∣ny other Good men, in the Opinion, That a∣mong the <HI>Engines of Piety,</HI> wherewith our Good God has accommodated us, the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is one too much neglected with the Professors of our Holy Religion. To Recover the <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> unto the Use of our <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Joy,</HI> and thus to teach the <HI>Praising</HI> Tribe, the <HI>Use of the Bow,</HI> I saw to be so sensible a Ser∣vice unto the <HI>Designs of Piety,</HI> that I could not but chearfully Embrace it. A very few Hours, and not many more, than the Modern Inspec∣tion finds <HI>Colours</HI> in the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> made me an▪ Owner of such <HI>Thoughts</HI> upon my <HI>bright Theme,</HI> that I began to imagine, I had honest Old <HI>Bernards</HI> Imprimatur for them; <HI>Si metu forte, aut Segnitie, aut minus discreta Humilitat, Verbum bonum, quod possit prodesse multis, inutili, imo et damnabili Ligas Silentio, certe maledictus eris, qui Frumenta abscondis in Populis.</HI> Accord∣ingly
<PB N="ii" REF="001559_0003_0FB3B0D3A47CBE78"/>
they are now offered unto the <HI>Children of the Covenant</HI> And One of the Things wanting in the <HI>Christian Asceticks</HI> is thus brought in to the Churches Treasury.</P>
<P>The Readers for whose Edification these <HI>Es∣sayes</HI> are chiefly Calculated, are for the most part Plain men, <HI>Dwelling in Tents.</HI> It would rather <HI>puzzle</HI> such Readers, than <HI>Instruct</HI> them, to give them a Lecture on the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> Nor does the Author profess himself to be so much of a <HI>Mathematician,</HI> as to do it with the Exactness, wherewith it ought to be done, or to be any more than a <HI>Well∣willer to such Mathematicks.</HI></P>
<P>A Famous Clergy-man of <HI>Spalato,</HI> in a Book <HI>De Radijs Visus et Lucis,</HI> Written before the Be∣ginning of the former Century, began <HI>Mathe∣matically</HI> to describe how the <HI>Interior Bow</HI> of the <HI>Iris,</HI> is made in Round Drops of <HI>Rain,</HI> by a Re∣fraction of the Suns Light, and One Reflection between them; and the <HI>Exterior,</HI> by Two Re∣fractions, and Two sorts of Reflections between them, in each Drop of Water.</P>
<P><HI>Descartes,</HI> (who don't use to betray his Tu∣tors,) took the Hints from <HI>Antonius De Dominis,</HI> and went on <HI>Mathematically,</HI> and with much Demonstration, to give us a Theory of the <HI>I∣ris,</HI> from the Laws of <HI>Refraction,</HI> which <HI>Lucid Rayes</HI> do suffer in passing thro' Diaphanous Bo∣dies. He clearly demonstrated the <HI>primary I∣ris,</HI> to be only, <HI>The Suns Image, reflected from the Concave Surfaces, of an Innumerable Quantity of
<PB N="iii" REF="001559_0004_0FB3B0D54DF63030"/>
small Sphaerical Drops of falling Rain, with this Necessary Circumstance, that those Rays which fell on the Objects, parallel to each other, should not after One Reflection, and Two Refractions,</HI> (viz. <HI>At going into the Drop and coming out again</HI>) <HI>be Dispersed, or made to diverge, but come back again also to the Eye, parallel to each other.</HI> The <HI>Secondary Iris</HI> he supposes <HI>produced by those Rays of the Sun, which fall more obliquely, but after the same manner as be∣fore, only in these there are Two Reflections before the Suns Rays refracted a second time, and tending towards his Eye, in a parallel Position, can get out from the Aqueous Globules.</HI></P>
<P>The Acute and Accurate Mr. <HI>Halley</HI> comes after the <HI>French</HI> Philosopher, and shows how the <HI>Cartesian</HI> Problems were more easily solved than the Author himself imagined, He shows how to determine the Angle, by which the <HI>I∣ris</HI> is distant from the opposite Point of the Sun, and the <HI>Ratio</HI> of the Refraction being given Geometrically, or, <HI>Vice Versa,</HI> the <HI>Iris</HI> being given, to determine the Refractive Pow∣er of the Liquor. And he goes on to Cul∣tivate the Subject, with the Ingenuity pro∣per to that accomplished Gentleman.</P>
<P>But then comes the Admirable Sir <HI>Isaac Newton;</HI> One whom I may venture to call The <HI>Perpetual Dictator</HI> of the Learned World in the <HI>Principles of Natural Philosophy;</HI> and the most Sagacious Reasoner upon the <HI>Laws of Na∣ture,</HI> that has yet Shone among Mankind; and which is the Crown of all, The most Vic∣torious
<PB N="iv" REF="001559_0005_0FB3B0D6E47A3220"/>
Assertor of an Infinite GOD, that hath appeared in the bright Army of them that have driven the baffled Herd of <HI>Atheists</HI> away from the Tents of Humanity. This Rare Person, in his Incomparable Treatise of <HI>Opticks,</HI> has yet further Explained the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the <HI>Rain∣bow;</HI> &amp; has not only shown how the <HI>Bow</HI> is made, but also how the COLOURS are form'd; How the Rays do strike the Senses, with the <HI>Colours,</HI> in the Order which is required by their Degrees of <HI>Refrangibility,</HI> in the Pro∣gress from the Inside of the <HI>Bow</HI> to the <HI>Outside;</HI> the <HI>Violet,</HI> the <HI>Indico,</HI> the <HI>Blue,</HI> the <HI>Green,</HI> the <HI>Yellow,</HI> the <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>Red.</HI></P>
<P>But if all my Countrymen could Read <HI>Ough∣treds</HI> Characters, or ken the Terms &amp; Rules of <HI>Trigonometry,</HI> with the Doctrine of <HI>Fluxions;</HI> yet my Printer could not easily accommodate us, with the <HI>Schemes</HI> that would be needful for <HI>Dilucidation.</HI> The very few that would be gra∣tified with such things, I leave to Consult the Authors themselves, &amp; shall proceed unto more <HI>Theological</HI> and <HI>Agreeable</HI> Contemplations.</P>

<P>The Lord shall make Bright Clouds.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Mind commonly forming of <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> &amp; filled with them on all Occasions is thereby really Ennobled and Enriched: And <HI>Thoughts</HI> do not more prove the <HI>Existence</HI> of it, than <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wise</HI> Ones will contribute unto its <HI>Felicity.</HI> Such a <HI>Mind</HI> makes a just claim, to the <HI>Dignity,</HI> which in REASON belongs unto it; and it <HI>has,</HI> yea, it <HI>makes,</HI> a sort of <HI>Heaven</HI> for it self, with an Holy Anticipation of the more Local Flight, it is e're long to take into the <HI>Heavenly World.</HI> It follows, that One of the best Kindnesses that can be done unto the Children of Men, is to <HI>Supply</HI> them with <HI>Good Thoughts:</HI> One of the Kindest Offices that we can do for our Neighbours, is to awaken in them the <HI>Thought</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001559_0009_0FB3B0DD6F5ABDE0"/>
of the <HI>Rational</HI> and <HI>Religious;</HI> and help them in <HI>Thinking</HI> on the Things wherein they are con∣cerned. <HI>Of Writing many Books</HI> for this End, our <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> long since advised, <HI>Let there be no End!</HI> Tho' the <HI>Study</HI> of Writing them should be <HI>never such a Weariness to the Flesh,</HI> yet we will not be <HI>Weary of Well-doing</HI> in this way, nor count it a <HI>Vanity,</HI> in this way to go on with Es∣sayes to cure <HI>Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>We are surrounded with the Preachers of Truth unto us; All the Elements are full of them: In all <HI>Creatures</HI> we have the Faithful <HI>Preachers;</HI> if we have but <HI>Ears to hear them.</HI> To put the <HI>Creatures</HI> unto such an Use, as that of being Led by them unto <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> and unto the due Acknowledgments of Their and Our Maker and Saviour; 'tis, to do some∣thing towards the <HI>Restitution of all Things,</HI> unto the Primitive and Paradisian State; yea, O <HI>Sons of God,</HI> it is a little to bring on the State, for <HI>which the whole Creation groaneth!</HI> Of our <HI>Duties,</HI> and of His <HI>Praises</HI> to whom we owe our Duties, I will say, <HI>Great is the Army that Publish∣eth them!</HI> And the Kingdom of METEORS has raised for us a particular Army of <HI>Monitors;</HI> among which there is none that makes a more Illustrious Figure, than <HI>One</HI> which I am go∣ing to rescue from the Neglect, with which it has been too much disregarded &amp; overlooked in a World, which owes more pious Regards unto it.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> Of this you Expect
<PB N="3" REF="001559_0010_0FB3B0DF0BC945E0"/>
not from me, any Attempts at <HI>Philology.</HI> To tell you, that the Hebrew Name for it is, <HI>Ketcheth;</HI> The Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as well as the Latin, <HI>Iris;</HI> the French, <HI>L'arc du Ciel;</HI> (or, the Bow of Hea∣ven;) and in like manner, the Italian <HI>L'arco del Cielo;</HI> and the Spanish, <HI>El arco del Cielo;</HI> (as al∣so, <HI>El arco de las nueues,</HI> or, The Bow of the Clouds:) and the <HI>German</HI> (more akin to ours) <HI>Ein Regenbogen;</HI> This would perhaps as little E∣dify you, as to tell you, that <HI>our Indians</HI> call it by some such Name, as <HI>Ukqumogquoanuh.</HI> I shall as little attempt the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of it; For, after I have given you the common Definition of it, <HI>Arcus Coelestis, qui fit ex Solis Luce, in Nubem varie compositam et temperatam, sed ex Diametro Soli ipsi incurrente ac incidente, pluvioso tempore;</HI> and should add more than as many more, as there be <HI>Colours in the Rainbow;</HI> and with the Modern Corrections of ancient Er∣rors, proceed unto the Differences between the <HI>Solar Iris,</HI> and the <HI>Lunar:</HI> and between the <HI>Iris</HI> and the <HI>Halo;</HI> so little progress have we yet made in real and certain <HI>Knowledge,</HI> that I should Leave you after all, with the Subject of my Discourse, <HI>but in the Clouds.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a <HI>Theological</HI> Consideration of this <HI>Meteor</HI> that is now proposed. <HI>The Gospel of the Rainbow,</HI> is the Theme I have undertaken very briefly to treat upon. I take the <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> to be intended, when we read of <HI>Bright Clouds.</HI> The Glorious One, directed His Peo∣ple to <HI>Ask Rain</HI> of Him; <HI>a moderate Rain</HI> in
<PB N="4" REF="001559_0011_0FB3B0E0953E9940"/>
the Time that should render it Seasonable and Serviceable. It is hereupon promised, <HI>So the Lord shall make Bright Clouds:</HI> that is to say, <HI>Clouds brightned with the Rainbow;</HI> and such as a <HI>Moderate Rain,</HI> uses to be distilled from. Compare <HI>Job</HI> XXVII. 11. We often enjoy this Favour of Heaven; but I am now to bring you the <HI>Gospel</HI> of it. And my Treatise must begin with a Complaint, That the <HI>Christian World</HI> have taken so little Notice of a <HI>Meteor,</HI> upon which the <HI>Great God that formed all things,</HI> has put such a Stamp of peculiar Excellency. It has pleased His Infinite Majesty, to Stamp a <HI>Sacramental Character</HI> upon it, and make it as a <HI>Sacrament</HI> of His <HI>Covenant</HI> with the Children of Men. We all know, that when the Patriarch <HI>Noah,</HI> with his Family, came out of the <HI>Ark,</HI> the Glorious GOD <HI>comforted</HI> him, and his Posterity, with such an Advice as this; Gen. IX. 13.— 17. <HI>I set my Bow in the Cloud, and it shall be for a To∣ken of a Covenant, between Me, and the Earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a Cloud over the Earth, that the Bow shall be seen in the Cloud; and I will Look upon it, that I may Remember the Ever∣lasting Covenant between God, and every living Crea∣ture of all Flesh that is upon the Earth. And God said unto</HI> Noah, <HI>This is the Token of the Covenant which I have Established between Me and all Flesh that is upon the Earth.</HI> I believe the Bishop of <HI>Milain</HI> is the only Author in the World, that e∣ver understood this <HI>Bow</HI> of any other than the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> Now, certainly after this, When∣ever
<PB N="5" REF="001559_0012_0FB3B0E2CFD7DCC8"/>
a <HI>Rainbow</HI> is Exhibited, there is a Sett of <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> with which it should al∣ways be Look'd upon. But God is not Glori∣fied upon the view of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> so Com∣monly, so Devoutly, and with such <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> as ought to be: nor does it gene∣rally put us upon such <HI>Reflections</HI> of Christianity, as might be expected from a People of our Il∣luminations in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of the Glorious Lord. I must not make a <HI>Fruitless Complaint;</HI> and therefore my Design is, now to fit some <HI>Arrows</HI> for the <HI>Bow</HI> of God, and make ready a <HI>Quiver</HI> of <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> Which are to be shot from that <HI>Bow</HI> into the Minds of the Faith∣ful, as often as it appears unto us.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>First Use</HI> that we unavoidably make of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> will be in a way of <HI>Admiration.</HI> Tis truly an <HI>Admirable</HI> Spectacle. The Spectator of it, is to be called forth in those Terms; Job XXXVII. 14. <HI>Stand still, Con∣sider the Wondrous Works of God.</HI> And this the more Emphatically, because the <HI>Rainbow</HI> appears in the very next words of <HI>Elihu;</HI> for the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is meant in those words, <HI>He causes the Light of His Cloud to shine.</HI> The Pagan Theology makes the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to be the <HI>Daughter</HI> of <HI>Thaumas</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] because of the <HI>Wonderment</HI> wherewith we behold it; It is to us, we would rather say, The <HI>Mother of Wonderment.</HI> But the <HI>Wonders</HI> which it raises in our Minds, ought to be tuned into <HI>Praises</HI> of the <HI>Great God,</HI> whose <HI>Strength is in the Clouds,</HI> &amp;
<PB N="6" REF="001559_0013_0FB3B0E461AF5638"/>
who displays His Power there. HE is to be Admired &amp; Adored, &amp; with Devout Souls, we are to Look through the <HI>Bright Clouds,</HI> &amp; shoot up our <HI>Hallelujahs. Glorious LORD, How Various and how Beauteous are thy Works! With what Wisdom and what Beau∣ty hast thou made them all!</HI> The Lesson is <HI>A∣pocryphal,</HI> but Agreeable, which was long since given by the Son of <HI>Sirach;</HI> [Eccles. XLIII. 11, 12.] <HI>Look upon the Rainbow, and praise Him that made it; very beautiful it is in the bright∣ness thereof; It compasses the Heaven above with a Glorious Circle, and the Hands of the most High have bended it.</HI></P>
<P>But we may not, we will not flop here. We will go on to such an <HI>Useful Contemplati∣on</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> as may render it a no∣ble <HI>Instrument of Piety,</HI> in our whole Conversation. I shall not Enquire <HI>into</HI> the old Opinion, that the Spots of <HI>Earth,</HI> where the <HI>Feet</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> strike, are made singularly <HI>Fruitful</HI> by the Influences or it. But I am sure, the <HI>Rainbow</HI> striking on our Minds, may produce many Sweet <HI>Fruits</HI> of Pious <HI>Meditation.</HI> When it pleases the Holy One to bring out His <HI>Rainbow</HI> un∣to our View, Let us Glorify Him, and <HI>Me∣ditate</HI> such things as these upon it.</P>

<HEAD>The First MEDITATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>What a Woful, what a Fearful Desolation, once came upon a Wicked World, whose Foundation was
<PB N="7" REF="001559_0014_0FB3B0E5AAA53C80"/>
overflown with a Flood!</HI> Inasmuch as it was the <HI>Flood</HI> which introduced the Consideration of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> the sight of it, may very suitably bring to Remembrance with us, that horrible <HI>Flood,</HI> in which as we have read, 2 Pet. II. 5. <HI>God spared not the Old World, bringing in the Flood upon the Ungodly.</HI> It has been well enough pro∣posed, <HI>Admoneat Iris horrendi illius Judicii, quod in Di uvio ostensum fuit. Mercer</HI> tells us, That the Religious Jews, in many Places, upon the Appearance of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> go forth, and fall down, and confess their Sins, and own themselves worthy to be Drowned with a <HI>Flood,</HI> for their Iniquities. To us, that are <HI>Christians,</HI> Our LORD says, <HI>What do you more than they?</HI></P>
<P>There is no room to doubt the Relation which the <HI>Mosaic Records</HI> have given us, of that astonishing Revolution, The FLOOD, wherein all Mankind, except the One Family of a Righ∣teous <HI>Noah,</HI> perished. It is a <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> whereof the Evidences are so many and so mighty, that they must <HI>Overwhelm</HI> all the Con∣tradiction of Infidelity, and, like the <HI>Flood</HI> it self, carry all before them. It was acknowledg∣ed by the most Ancient Writers among the Pa∣gans, quoted by <HI>Josephus,</HI> and by <HI>Eusebius,</HI> and by <HI>Cyril,</HI> and others. <HI>Plutarch</HI> also has the Sto∣ry of the <HI>Dove</HI> in the <HI>Flood</HI> sent out of the <HI>Ark.</HI> Tis demonstrated likewise by <HI>Kirker</HI> in his <HI>Arca Noae,</HI> that the <HI>Deucalion</HI> of Antiquity was our <HI>Noah.</HI> Yea, The Tradition of a General <HI>Flood,</HI> was every where Currant for Thousands of years

among all People; especially in the Countreys near the Place, where the <HI>Ark</HI> rested after the <HI>Flood.</HI> Even in the <HI>Coins</HI> used among them, es∣pecially those mentioned by <HI>Falconerius,</HI> there were Commemorations of it. <HI>Martinius</HI> re∣ports, that the <HI>Chinese</HI> have a Tradition of a <HI>Flood,</HI> in an History very agreeable to ours in the Book of <HI>Genesis. Acosta</HI> and <HI>Herrera</HI> find the like Tradition among the <HI>Indians</HI> of their Acquaintance in <HI>America; Corata</HI> found it a∣mong the <HI>Peruvians,</HI> and <HI>Gomara</HI> among the <HI>Mexicans.</HI> The insolent Attempts of <HI>Petrerius,</HI> and some others, to restrain the <HI>Flood</HI> unto <HI>Pa∣laestine,</HI> or to some few Countreys thereabouts, are not worthy of a Laborious Confutation. The Ruines and Reliques every where sound in the <HI>Subterraneous World,</HI> which could proceed from nothing but the <HI>Flood,</HI> (as our Accom∣plished and Victorious <HI>Woodward</HI> among the rest, &amp; beyond them all, has rendred incontestable,) abundantly confute the Impiety of those Men▪ and make it most evidently appear, that the <HI>Flood</HI> was nothing less than <HI>Universal.</HI> Among the rest, the Undisputed <HI>Skeleton</HI> of an <HI>Humane Bo∣dy,</HI> of about <HI>Seventy Foot Long,</HI> and his <HI>Teeth,</HI> some above <HI>Two Pounds,</HI> and others more than <HI>Four Pounds</HI> in Weight, lately dug up in our Neighbourhood at <HI>Albany,</HI> at such a Distance from the Sea, that it could be no <HI>Animal</HI> of the <HI>Sea:</HI> This can be no other, than a <HI>Lively Proof,</HI> brought from <HI>America.</HI> [How it came hither, <HI>Heaven knows!</HI>] to go into the Scale with many

of the same kind in the other Hemisphere, to con∣firm that passage of <HI>Moses, There were Giants in the Earth in those Dayes.</HI> In M. DC. LVI. years, there prevailed such a <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Wickedness</HI> in the World, that the Holy and Righteous God, by a <HI>Flood of Water,</HI> brought upon it, a most horrible Desolation. But, who can comprehend, who can imagine, the horror of the Desolation! Ma∣ny Refined Wits have Employ'd themselves, to frame <HI>Hypotheses,</HI> of the <HI>Methods of Nature,</HI> in which the <HI>Flood</HI> was brought about; until some of them fall into the Distemper, which Learned Men have wisely called an, <HI>Hypothesimania;</HI> and some of them have too much Excluded that Im∣mediate Interposition of the Almighty GOD, in a way transcending the usual course, and com∣mon Law, of <HI>Nature,</HI> which was doubtless made on this tremendous Occasion. The Fancies and Fictions which <HI>Burnet</HI> has offered us in his <HI>Theory,</HI> (proved by <HI>Ramazzini,</HI> to be no other, than what <HI>Patritius</HI> an <HI>Italian,</HI> Published as a part of the <HI>Abyssertian</HI> Philosophy, an hundred and fifty years ago,) have met with sharp castigations, from them, who have had at heart, the cause &amp; credit of the Sacred Scriptures. But, As of old, a <HI>Musician</HI> being asked, a Definition of the <HI>Soul,</HI> his answer was, Tis an <HI>Harmony!</HI> An answer that had a Tincture of his own Profession in it: So, I do not wonder, when I observe, what the Spe∣culations of Some Gentlemen on this Noble Subject, are tinged withal. A Professor of the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> brings in a <HI>Comet,</HI> as producing all

the hideous hurly burly of the <HI>Flood,</HI> by approach∣ing too near our Globe, in its Elliptick Motion. A Nation (of <HI>Whistons</HI>) that is not without its Probabilities: And agreeably to it, some Learned Men, foretel the Appearance of another <HI>Comet,</HI> [For old <HI>Seneca's</HI> Prediction about such Pre∣dictions is now accomplished!] which may bring our Globe, under the other Destruction, for which, we know, it is reserved. Nor am I with∣out Suspicions, That a <HI>Comet</HI> may be intended by the <HI>Vapour of Smoke,</HI> which is to bring on the <HI>Great and Notable Day of the Lord;</HI> which also is most Literally, <HI>A Star falling from Heaven:</HI> And some think, A World in a <HI>State of Punishment!</HI> A Professor of <HI>Chymistry,</HI> from what he had seen in the Effervescence between an <HI>Acid</HI> and an <HI>Alcali,</HI> concludes, that there are great <HI>Cavities</HI> in the Bowels of the Earth, full of <HI>Water;</HI> that <HI>Minerals</HI> are generated in these <HI>Cavities;</HI> that by the colluctation of several Salts meeting toge∣ther here, an Air was generated, which caused horrendous <HI>Earthquakes;</HI> that some of the Exha∣lation Escaping into our open Air, it produced vast <HI>Rains,</HI> with such Thunder and Lightning, as filled the Ungodly Men with a most con∣founding Amazement; and that by the Air still Enclosed under ground, the <HI>Water</HI> of the <HI>Abyss,</HI> raged and swelled, and broke out, &amp; overflow'd the highest Mountains. This (of <HI>St. Clairs</HI>) as probably conjectured as the other, I will pass over Mr. <HI>Delaprymes</HI> Imagination, That God broke the Foundations, Pillars, and Hollows, of the
<PB N="11" REF="001559_0018_0FB3B0EBDE06EB90"/>
Earth, which till then had stood above the Wa∣ter. The continual <HI>Rains</HI> help'd forward the Dissolution; the Earth yielded, and sunk down; it and all the wicked Burden of it, Subsided, and was absorb'd in the Sea, which now covers it; As this <HI>Old Earth</HI> fell in, our <HI>New Earth</HI> rose up; This was lifted up, to ballance the other; and as it Rose, the Waters rolled off, and left it at length to be what it is. This conjecture, seems liable to more objections than the former; and will have little but <HI>Plato's</HI> Tradition of the vast Island Swallow'd up in the <HI>Atlantick Ocean,</HI> to Support it. Our <HI>Warren</HI> takes the Account of the Flood given in the Sacred Scriptures, to be Sufficiently Ex∣plained, by Saying; That there were vast <HI>Ca∣verns,</HI> filled with <HI>Waters,</HI> in the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Moun∣tains. The Great GOD <HI>broke them open,</HI> and they came rolling down, and over-turning all that was in the way of the Mighty Inundation. At the same time, there fell prodigious <HI>Rains</HI> for Forty Dayes together. It was impossible for People to ascend these Mountains, when the Waters were issuing out from them, with such an impetuous Power &amp; Plenty: and the Loaden <HI>Clouds,</HI> hanging &amp; bagging about them, Empti∣ed themselves there, like pressed Spunges, and ran down in irresistible Torrents. Doubtless, the <HI>Air</HI> was full of <HI>Water-spouts,</HI> like the <HI>Exhydriae,</HI> which are at Sea sometimes met withal; and the Hills were full of <HI>Cataracts</HI> Poured out by the Vengeance of God. This Gentleman, finds e∣nough here to drown the World; and thinks
<PB N="12" REF="001559_0019_0FB3B0EE55E57030"/>
there is no Necessity of understanding the Bible, as if the <HI>Waters</HI> of the <HI>Flood,</HI> were <HI>Fifteen Cubits</HI> above the <HI>Tops</HI> of the <HI>Highest Mountains.</HI></P>
<P>There is an Excellent <HI>Ray,</HI> who will bring us yet more <HI>Light,</HI> concerning this wondrous Revoluti∣on. According to <HI>him,</HI> the <HI>Windows of Heaven</HI> were now <HI>Opened,</HI> by the Quantities of <HI>Water,</HI> descen∣ding from thence; all the <HI>Water</HI> Suspended in the <HI>Air</HI> descending on the <HI>Earth.</HI> The <HI>Fountains of the Great Deep</HI> were now also <HI>broken up,</HI> in that the <HI>Subterraneous Waters</HI> which communicate with the <HI>Sea,</HI> did thro' great Apertures rush out upon the World. But for the cause of all this, he Supposes, that the Glorious God, now changed the <HI>Center</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and set it nearer to the Middle of that <HI>Haemisphere,</HI> which was then prin∣cipally inhabited! Here-upon the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and <HI>Pacifick</HI> Oceans, must needs press upon the <HI>Subterraneous Abyss.</HI> By the Mediation thereof, they must force the Water upward, and compel it to run out at those <HI>Wide Mouthes,</HI> which the Indignation of God had made for it. The <HI>Water</HI> poured out from these direful Orifices, upon the Earth, must needs overflow it; until the Omni∣potent God restored the former Center of the World Finally; The Incomparable Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> judges the Universal <HI>Flood,</HI> cannot have better, and fairer Account given of it, than this, To Suppose the <HI>Center</HI> of <HI>Gravitation</HI> re∣moved for a Time, towards the Middle of the then inhabited Parts of the World: And a change of its Place, but the Two Thousandth

part of the <HI>Radius</HI> of this Globe, were enough to bury the <HI>Tops</HI> of the <HI>Highest Mountains</HI> under <HI>Wa∣ter.</HI> But we have notorious Proofs, in our <HI>Sub∣terraneous Occurrences,</HI> that the <HI>Flood</HI> reached unto <HI>America</HI> too. I add therefore, the same cause o∣perating a little further, would over-whelm <HI>this,</HI> as well as the other <HI>Haemisphere.</HI> After all, we may truly say, that there was a concurrence of <HI>many Causes,</HI> to bring on the Deluge. It is admi∣rable, that <HI>Seneca,</HI> treating of that <HI>Fatal Day,</HI> (which he dreamt of, as being still to come,) <HI>when a Deluge is to come;</HI> He joyns together <HI>many Causes</HI> for such a thing; but all concurring, <HI>Uno agmine ad Exitium humani generis.</HI> But he does it in such Terms, that the Acute <HI>Heidegger</HI> cryes out; <HI>Ora∣tio ita concepta est, ut de industria Explicare voluisse</HI> Mosen <HI>videri Posset.</HI> And <HI>Patrick</HI> after him; <HI>His Words are written, as if he had been directed to make a Commentary upon</HI> Moses.</P>

<P>What remains, is, That the view of the <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> calls us to look back upon the Desolation which the <HI>Flood</HI> once brought upon a <HI>Well-peopled</HI> World. <HI>Well-peopled,</HI> I may say; For considering the <HI>Longevity</HI> of the <HI>Antediluvians,</HI> it is not un∣likely, <HI>That more People Perished in the Flood, than there be now alive in the World.</HI> Suppose a Man to have Children, at sixty years of Age, and on∣ly in the next forty years to have Twenty Chil∣dren. Single out now the shortest Liver of any mentioned, Except <HI>Enoch,</HI> before the Flood; and from that one Stock of Seven hundred years, multiplying still by Twenty, you'l find the pro∣duce to be more than One thousand, three hun∣dred, and forty seven Millions; <HI>More People than are now Alive on the face of the Earth.</HI> And yet, I must also say, <HI>Ill-peopled.</HI> For it was, <HI>The World of the Ungodly.</HI> A World wherein, Gen. VI. 11, 12. <HI>The Earth was corrupt before God, and the Earth was
<PB N="15" REF="001559_0022_0FB3B0F325B73660"/>
filled with Violence. God Looked upon the Earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all Flesh had corrupted His way upon the Earth.</HI> Behold then, to what our <HI>Meditation</HI> shall carry us, on this occasion.</P>
<P><HI>O Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty. The Sin of Mankind once Provoked thee, to destroy a World of Men, with a dreadful Flood of thy Wrath; and with them, to destroy all the works of their Hands; to de∣stroy the Creatures also, which by their Sin were Per∣verted and Polluted unto other Purposes, than those for which thou hadst created them. I see, I see, Thou art of Purer Eyes, than to behold Evil, and thou canst not Look upon Iniquity. Oh! the Evil of Sin! Oh! what a Destroying Evil! My God, Affect me with deep Ap∣prehensions of that Monstrous Evil. Oh! let me not be one of the Fools, that shall make Light of such a Match∣less Evil. Make me most Particularly afraid of the Sins, which were most reigning among the Antediluvian Sinners; Afraid of that Intemperance, that Unchastity, that Oppression and Injustice, for which the Gene∣ration of Sinners before the Flood, are branded in thine Oracles. Oh! Do not leave me to do those abomina∣ble Things, which are hated by thy Soul, O my God!</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Second MEDITATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Great GOD, will not have this World, tho' a very Sinful one, to be drown'd any more; nor His Church in the World.</HI> This is the COVENANT, which our God has made with the <HI>Earth;</HI> and the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is the <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Seal</HI> to the <HI>Cove∣nant.</HI> We should thankfully <HI>Remember</HI> it, as often
<PB N="16" REF="001559_0023_0FB3B0F4F5EDC170"/>
as we see the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> and Say; <HI>Blessed be our Gracious and Merciful and Long-suffering Lord, who hath Swarn, that the Waters of Noah shall go over the Earth no more!</HI></P>
<P>Before I go any further, I Suppose, it will be Expected; that we a little Consider that noted Question.</P>
<P><HI>Whether there were any <HI>Rainbow</HI> before the Flood?</HI></P>
<P>I answer two things. First; There is nothing in <HI>Scripture,</HI> no, nor <HI>Nature</HI> neither, to assure us, that <HI>there was.</HI> We are not sure, that the Constitution of the <HI>Air,</HI> and of the <HI>Clouds,</HI> before the <HI>Flood,</HI> was the same, that it was afterwards. We are sure, that the <HI>Flood</HI> brought a Marvellous Alteration on the World; probably on the <HI>Air,</HI> as well as on the <HI>Earth.</HI> Doubtless the New Constitution of the <HI>Air,</HI> was that which had a Share in changing the Constitution of our <HI>Bodies,</HI> till there came on that <HI>Abbrevation</HI> of Humane Life, which we are now brought unto. Dr. <HI>Jackson</HI> argues, That if other <HI>Natural Causes</HI> de∣pend upon the <HI>Final,</HI> which we are taught in the <HI>Scriptural Philosophy,</HI> we may well think, that the <HI>Air</HI> before the <HI>Flood,</HI> had not the peculiar Dispo∣sition, which is required unto the Production of the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> which then had not such an <HI>End,</HI> as that for which it is now Employ'd by the Glorious God. It is now a <HI>Messenger,</HI> that Reports and Confirms unto the <HI>New World,</HI> the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, for the Preservation of it. If it had been a common appearance unto the <HI>Old
<PB N="17" REF="001559_0024_0FB3B0F9634BBC70"/>
World,</HI> it would scarce have appeared now with so Confirming and Comforting an Efficacy, to <HI>Noah</HI> and his timerous Posterity.</P>
<P>But then, Secondly; Tho' <HI>Aben Ezra</HI> thinks there was no <HI>Rainbow</HI> before the <HI>Flood,</HI> and many Christians also deny the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Ex∣istence of it; yet very many will say with my Learned <HI>Helvetian, Oppido falluntur;</HI> They are very much mistaken. The Army of them, who Engage on this side, will have no less than a Great <HI>Calvin,</HI> for a <HI>Standard-bearer.</HI> The Lord speaks not of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> as a <HI>New Thing;</HI> He seems to speak of it, as a Thing that had been already placed in the <HI>Clouds; I have set my Bow in the Cloud.</HI> He invites us rather to Look on the <HI>New Use</HI> which He assigns unto it. Sup∣pose a <HI>Rainbow</HI> before the <HI>Flood.</HI> Why, so 'tis in all our <HI>Sacramental Elements.</HI> The <HI>Water,</HI> the <HI>Bread,</HI> the <HI>Wine,</HI> that are used in our <HI>Sacra∣ments</HI> did Exist before; This is no prejudice to the <HI>Sacramental Importance,</HI> which they carry with them, after a <HI>Consecration</HI> from Heaven for that purpose on them. To this purpose <HI>Danae∣us</HI> in his <HI>Physice Christiana,</HI> says, To conclude from the <HI>Sacramental Importance</HI> of the <HI>Rain∣bow,</HI> that there was no such thing before the <HI>Flood,</HI> is no other, <HI>quam si quis Bov<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s ante Sacri∣ficia Lege Mos<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s praescripta, vel Aquam ante Baptis∣mum non fuis<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Colligat.</HI></P>
<P>I return to my <HI>Meditation</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rainbow</HI> is Expresly called. <HI>A Token of the Covenant.</HI> One would suspect, the Pagant
<PB N="18" REF="001559_0025_0FB3B0FAC0DDC188"/>
had some Notion of this; when they would have this Meteor to be, <HI>Internuncia Deorum,</HI> the <HI>Messenger of the Gods.</HI> With <HI>Homer</HI> 'tis, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as if one should say, <HI>An Angel of the Covenant.</HI> He represents <HI>Iris</HI> therefore, as being sent with a peremptory Command unto <HI>Neptune,</HI> that he should not aid the <HI>Graecians;</HI> doubtless, by the Swelling of the <HI>Waters.</HI> The Name <HI>Iris,</HI> per∣haps may be from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>i. e.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Or, from the Chaldee, <HI>Ir,</HI> an <HI>Angel.</HI></P>
<P>Some will have the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to be a <HI>To∣ken of the Covenant,</HI> which may be called, <HI>Que∣dammodo Naturale;</HI> inasmuch as it is only seen, when the <HI>Clouds</HI> are so thin, as to give no Ap∣prehensions of <HI>Showers</HI> enough to make another <HI>Flood. Valesius</HI> accordingly says, <HI>Qui enim possit, cum ne{que} Caelum totum Obductum nubibus sit ne{que} quae adsunt sunt valde densae?</HI> Thus <HI>Aquinas,</HI> and <HI>Ca∣jetan,</HI> and <HI>Cardan;</HI> Thus among the Hebrews, R. <HI>Levi Ben Gerson;</HI> who is also followed by <HI>Vossius.</HI> But some will hardly allow the Expres∣sion; because the <HI>Flood</HI> was not accomplished by meer <HI>Showers;</HI> but with some <HI>Supernatural Circumstances.</HI> The <HI>Rainbow</HI> they will have to be a <HI>Token of the Covenant</HI> purely by <HI>Instituti∣on.</HI> And with very much of Reason, if the Prognostications of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>Pluvius Vates,</HI> (as the <HI>Rainbow</HI> was of old called) be as Uncertain as <HI>Pliny</HI> would make them; <HI>Nam ne pluvios quidem, aut Serenos Dies, cum Fide porten∣dunt.</HI> And yet we can't but own there is in the <HI>Rainbow</HI> some sort of <HI>Analogy,</HI> with the <HI>Co∣venant,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001559_0026_0FB3B0FC4FC32030"/>
whereof it is Instituted for a <HI>Token;</HI> whereof one point is this; The <HI>Rainbow</HI> is <HI>Naturally</HI> a <HI>Token,</HI> that the <HI>Rains</HI> will not be <HI>Great,</HI> nor <HI>Long;</HI> and that <HI>Fair Weather</HI> is anon to be Look'd for. <HI>Bodin</HI> speaks the Sense of the usual Prognostications on the Appearance of the <HI><HI>Rainbow;</HI> Certissimum est Argumentum, Imbres fore Leviores.</HI> 'Tis therewithal a most a∣greeable and Symbolical <HI>Token,</HI> that the World shall not be any more so Destructively, as once it was, <HI>Rained</HI> upon. Look upon it according∣ly; and say upon it; <HI>Oh! the Patience of our God! Tho' the Earth deserve as much as ever, to be drown'd, for the Wickedness of Mankind upon it, yet thou sparest it, O Lord, and thou hast promised, that thou wilt still do so.</HI></P>
<P>But then, I propose, that our Thoughts go on to Consider, on <HI>whose,</HI> and on <HI>what</HI> Account the World comes to be so spared by the Lord.</P>
<P>When the Lord says unto <HI>Noah, With thee will I establish my Covenant,</HI> it is a Remark of <HI>Mun∣ster</HI> upon it; That this refers to the <HI>Covenant</HI> made at the Beginning, about the <HI>Promised Seed,</HI> that was to break the <HI>Old Serpents Head.</HI> This <HI>Covenant</HI> is now Renewed and Assured unto <HI>No∣ah;</HI> who now being satisfied, That the <HI>Messiah</HI> was to descend from him, he could no longer doubt, that God would have a <HI>Church</HI> continued among his Posterity. Accordingly, When we think on the <HI>Preservation</HI> of the World, promi∣sed with the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> it should be with such Thoughts as these; <HI>Tis for thy sake, O our
<PB N="20" REF="001559_0027_0FB3B0FDB76FF888"/>
Saviour, that such a Sinful World is preserved. O Just One, Thou art the Everlasting Foundation that the World stands upon! Oh! What shall we do for thee, and for thy Service, Thou Preserver of Men!</HI> The Name of <HI>Nazarene,</HI> signifies, <HI>A Preserver.</HI> Our JESUS of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> is our Glorious <HI>Na∣zarene.</HI></P>
<P>And then, as it is well remark'd by <HI>Hei∣degger;</HI> The CHURCH of God has a singu∣lar, a peculiar Concernment, in this <HI>Covenant</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> The <HI>Churches</HI> coming to <HI>Righteousness</HI> by the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and so the <HI>Inheri∣tance</HI> of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> lies Enwrapped in it. And that passage, <HI>Neither shall all Flesh be cut off,</HI> carries an Intimation, that God will be∣come the God of <HI>All Nations,</HI> and bring some of <HI>All Nations</HI> into His Kingdom. Indeed, the <HI>Preservation</HI> of all <HI>Creatures,</HI> is for the sake of the <HI>Church. All is yours!</HI> It was no mistake in <HI>Fe∣rus; Pactum cum Noe Prefiguravit Faedus Christi cum Ecclesia.</HI> But he might have said more than so. Indeed, The Signification of the <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> is to be so Summed up; <Q>That there shall not come another <HI>Universal Flood</HI> upon the World; but that God will preserve a <HI>Church</HI> in the World; and make it <HI>Righteous,</HI> &amp; bring it to <HI>Inherit the World;</HI> and all this, for the sake of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> whom we find afterwards ap∣pearing with a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about Him.</Q></P>
<P>Our Saviour has a <HI>People</HI> in the World; A <HI>People,</HI> that believe in Him; that follow His Conduct; that in the way of Obedience to
<PB N="21" REF="001559_0028_0FB3B0FF51D77970"/>
Him, Look for a Resurrection from the Dead, unto the Blessedness of a Better World. He will always have such a <HI>People.</HI> All the Pow∣ers of Darkness have been always carrying on a Design to Extinguish this <HI>People,</HI> and Leave no true <HI>Church</HI> of our Saviour in the World. This <HI>Catholick Church</HI> has been the Torment of the <HI>Devil,</HI> the Envy and Eye-sore of his <HI>Chil∣dren;</HI> both his Invisible and his Incarnate <HI>Le∣gions.</HI> Horrible <HI>Floods of the Ungodly</HI> have of∣ten threatned the Ruine of the <HI>Church; Floods</HI> of <HI>Corruptions; Floods</HI> of <HI>Haeresies; Floods</HI> of <HI>Per∣secutions.</HI> If our Great Saviour had not laid a strange Restraint upon them, there had not been Left any true <HI>Church</HI> upon Earth. <HI>If the Lord had not been on our side,</HI> may the Faith∣ful now say, <HI>If the Lord had not been on our side, the Waters had overwhelmed us, the Streams had gone over our Soul.</HI> There are marvellous Repetitions of that Observation; <HI>The Wrath of Hell does but Praise the Lord, and the Remainder of that Wrath does He Restrain!</HI> Hence, When the <HI>Church-state</HI> has been Deserted, Betrayed, Quite gone, in one place; and the <HI>Children of the Kingdom</HI> have Sinned it away, and Sin∣ned themselves into <HI>Outer Darkness,</HI> it has been produced immediately in another place; the <HI>Kingdom</HI> has been translated unto <HI>Other People,</HI> that have <HI>brought forth the Fruits thereof.</HI> This, This is the Voice of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> unto us, <HI>Be Encouraged, O People of God: Let things Look never so dismally, your Saviour will have a
<PB N="22" REF="001559_0029_0FB3B100A384D988"/>
Faithful People in the World: He will come down from the Machin of Heaven where you now see this Rainbow, and rescue His Church, when things come to an Extremity, and it Looks as if its Help were gone; and as if there were none shut up or left.</HI> Sirs, What can we now do, but return that Joyful Echo; <HI>Lord, I believe thy Promise for thy People; Oh! Let me be one of that Holy People.</HI></P>
<P>It may be Enquired, How far this Faith may be Exercised, with Relation to any <HI>Particular Church,</HI> which may have any <HI>Floods</HI> assaulting and hazarding of it; How far the <HI>Promise</HI> may be applied unto this or that <HI>Particular Church</HI> in the Dangers of it? It must be sadly confessed; Some <HI>Churches</HI> are utterly Drown'd in the <HI>Floods</HI> which the Divine Indignation pours in upon them. <HI>Every one</HI> of those that are men∣tioned in our Bible, alas, <HI>Every one</HI> of them have been so. All of those many Thousands that once were in <HI>Asia,</HI> and in <HI>Africa,</HI> have been so. Several Thousands in <HI>Europe,</HI> even in our Dayes have been so. But we may say, Never, until the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God has been grie∣vously neglected, shamefully despised in them. Let there be a Godly People in a <HI>Church,</HI> and let these Humbly plead with God, His <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI> and represent His <HI>Rainbow</HI> before Him, in the Distresses of that <HI>Church;</HI> and let the <HI>Du∣ties</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> then be Livelily Prosecuted there. <HI>Then!</HI> That Church will be that <HI>House,</HI> whereof we read, <HI>The Rain descends, the Floods come, and the Winds blow, and beat upon the House; and it falls not, for it is founded on a Rock.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Third MEDITATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A Glorious CHRIST! How can I Look to Hea∣ven at any Time, and especially NOW! without ra∣vishing Thoughts of Him and of His Glories!</HI> The <HI>Rainbow</HI> will many wayes put us in mind of our Admirable Saviour. He would not have appeared with a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about Him, as He did in the Visions both of <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and of <HI>John,</HI> if He did not intend that the <HI>Rainbow</HI> should Lead us to think of Him. Shall we say, That the <HI>Covenant</HI> on which our Eternal Safety depends, is made with our <HI>Saviour?</HI> Tis verily so; The Agreement is between God the Fa∣ther, and our <HI>Saviour.</HI> He is <HI>our Head;</HI> We are nothing but what we are <HI>in Him.</HI> Shall we go on to say, That all the <HI>Good</HI> Engaged unto us in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of our Safety, is owing to our <HI>Saviour?</HI> Tis verily so; Our <HI>Saviour</HI> is the <HI>Purchaser</HI> of it all; the <HI>Dispenser</HI> of it all. The <HI>Rainbow</HI> is the Proclamation of, A God <HI>Re∣conciled</HI> unto the Children of Men. <HI>Iris</HI> is re∣lated unto <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. 'Tis our JESUS that is the Author of the <HI>Reconciliation.</HI> We read, 2 Cor. V. 19. Of, <HI>God in CHRIST, Reconciling the World unto Himself.</HI> At the View of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> this were a very proper Acknowledgment; <HI>'Tis by thy Mediation, O our dear Saviour, that the Great GOD becomes Reconciled unto us!</HI></P>
<P>I will proceed; There are some, who would find in the <HI>Rainbow</HI> it self, some Intimations of
<PB N="24" REF="001559_0031_0FB3B104851D3440"/>
the <HI>Glories</HI> belonging to our <HI>Saviour.</HI> In the <HI>Sun</HI> begetting of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> some would read a little of that incomprehensible Mystery, <HI>The only begotten Son of God.</HI> In the <HI>Three Colours</HI> (for of old, they counted no more) of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> others would read, the <HI>Three Offi∣ces</HI> of our Great Redeemer. But these are <HI>Strains</HI> that I would not insist upon; and I would not Look upon the <HI>Clouds</HI> too fancifully. One would rather Consider the <HI>Sun,</HI> as an Em∣blem of our Saviour; that wonderful <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI> And here, tho' I am somewhat gratified, with a Good Thought, which I find in a Sermon, <HI>Of the Rainbow,</HI> Preached by Mr. <HI>Bourn,</HI> almost an hundred years ago; <Q>This <HI>Bow</HI> is in the <HI>Clouds;</HI> the further we are from it, the less beautiful, and glorious does it ap∣pear; and so, the further we are from Jesus Christ, by our Corruption, and our Continu∣ance and Impenitence in Sin, the less beauti∣ful, and glorious, and excellent will He ap∣pear unto us: But the nearer we approach to Him, in Faith and Holiness, the more Glori∣ous will He be to us, and the more Earnestly shall we Long to Enjoy Him.</Q> Yet I would rather chuse to turn it so; the <HI>Cloud,</HI> by Recei∣ving <HI>Beams</HI> from the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp; Reflecting of them, how Beautiful an Appearance is there now produced on it? <HI>Lord, Let the Beams of my Sa∣viour fall upon me. Let me receive His Knowledge; Let me reflect His Image; Let me be under His Im∣pressions; I cannot ask for a greater Glory!</HI> I re∣member
<PB N="25" REF="001559_0032_0FB3B105E7201918"/>
it was of old given as the Commen∣dation of a Famous and Useful man; Ecclesi∣ast. L. 7. <HI>He was as the Rainbows giving Light in</HI> the <HI>Bright Clouds.</HI> The way to arrive unto such a <HI>Glory</HI> is to get near, and keep near our Admi∣rable <HI>Saviour;</HI> to hold Communion with Him, and to be under His Influences. The more a CHRIST is Entertained by any man, the more <HI>Glorious</HI> is He!</P>
<P>But then, I will take Leave, to fetch from the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> an Instruction of the <HI>Humility,</HI> that such a man will be adorned withal. The most Learned man perhaps (I take him to have been so) that ever was in the world, was him∣self a bright Instance of his own Observation, in his, <HI>Theologia Naturalis.</HI> The <HI>Higher</HI> the <HI>Sun,</HI> the <HI>Lesser</HI> the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> So, <HI>Quo Altior est Sol Justitiae Deus in Cordibus nostris, Et quo plura in nos Confert Dona, eo minores esse debemus, Et <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de∣bemus Superbire.</HI> The <HI>Higher</HI> a Glorious CHRIST is with us, and in us, and the more He does for us, the <HI>Smaller</HI> must we be in our own Eyes; it will Humble us, and Abate our Pride most won∣derfully!</P>

<HEAD>The Fourth MEDITATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Tho' a Watery Flood that may drown the World, is no more to be fear'd, yet there is a Fiery Flood, for the depredations whereof a miserable World is grow∣ing horribly combustible.</HI> There is a Desolation to come on this Lower World, which the Wri∣tings
<PB N="26" REF="001559_0033_0FB3B1079949BD58"/>
of the Ancients mention under the Name of, <HI>Diluvium Ignis;</HI> a <HI>Fiery Flood.</HI> Some think, the Heathen themselves had some Notion of this, Lying under the <HI>Embers</HI> of their Fable, that made <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> (a Name that carries, <HI>Fire</HI> in it,) the Wife of their <HI>Deucalion.</HI> Tis well-known, that their Philosophers tell of, an, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or, <HI>Conflagration,</HI> which the World is one day to un∣dergo. The Oracles of the Sacred Scripture have positively declared it; 2 Pet. III. 7. <HI>The Heavens and Earth which are now, be reserved unto Fire, against the Day of Judgment, and Perdition of Ungodly Men.</HI> And some read it, in the very <HI>Colours</HI> of the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> as plainly Legible there as ever it could be upon <HI>Seths</HI> Pillars of old: The <HI>Watery</HI> Colour Leads them, to think on the <HI>Water</HI> which once destroy'd the World. The <HI>Grassy</HI> Colour Leads them, to think on the <HI>Day of Patience</HI> which God now allows unto the World, to bring forth <HI>Fruit</HI> unto Him: The <HI>Fi∣ery</HI> Colour Leads them to think, on that <HI>Fire</HI> which is e're long to consume the World. Be that as it will; It is most certain from our Pro∣phecies of a Divine Inspiration, (and there can be no <HI>Colour</HI> for the Infidelity that questions it,) That the World which was once <HI>Drowned,</HI> is e're long to be <HI>Burned. By Fire will the Lord plead with all Flesh, and the Slain of the Lord shall be many.</HI> 'Tis true, In the Circumstances of the <HI>Conflagration</HI> to be Expected, there are <HI>Some things hard to be understood.</HI> It seems that the De∣scent of our Saviour, at, and for the Destructi∣on
<PB N="27" REF="001559_0034_0FB3B108E3763B58"/>
of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and the Beginning of the Bles∣sed <HI>Millennium,</HI> will not be without a <HI>Conflagrati∣on.</HI> Then, <HI>Our God shall come, and a Fire shall de∣vour before Him, and it shall be very Tempestuous round about Him.</HI> Then a <HI>Fire shall go before the Lord, that shall burn up His Enemies round about, and Lightnings will Enlighten the World, and the Earth shall tremble, and the Hills melt like Wax, at the presence of the Lord.</HI> But it looks as if this <HI>Conflagration</HI> would be <HI>Partial</HI> &amp; <HI>Progressive.</HI> The first and main Effects of it, will be on the <HI>Itali∣an</HI> Territories. And a <HI>Total Consumption</HI> of the whole world is not as yet to be accomplished. The Things then to come on, are those where∣of we have those Acclamations; <HI>Let the Earth be Glad, Let the Field be Joyful, Let all the Trees of the Wood Rejoyce.</HI> A <HI>Total Consumption</HI> of them, could not be proposed as that wherein they might <HI>be Glad,</HI> and <HI>be Joyful,</HI> and <HI>Rejoyce.</HI> No; the <HI>Earnest expectation of the Creature, waiting for the manifestation of the Sons of God,</HI> is now to be accomplished. That for which the <HI>Whole Crea∣tion groaneth,</HI> even to be <HI>brought into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God,</HI> is now to be ac∣complished. The worst that can then be sup∣posed, is what <HI>Salonius</HI> of old, Express'd as the Sense of many more; <HI>Caelum et Terra transibunt per Meliorationem, non per Oblationem. Renovabun∣tur, non penitus distruentur. Tantum quippe ardebit Sursum, et Terra deorsum, quantum malitia hominum simul et Daemonum Coinquinare potuit.</HI> Yea, who can tell, but the <HI>Century</HI> is now begun, that
<PB N="28" REF="001559_0035_0FB3B10B723F53B8"/>
shall see this tremendous Revolution? I am sure, An Old Tradition, that the <HI>Rainbow</HI> shall cease to appear, forty years before the End of the World, is a poor security to be relied upon.</P>
<Q><L>Et quis nostrum non pavebit</L>
<L>Quando Judex apparebit?</L>
<L>Ante quem Ignis ardebit,</L>
<L>Peccatores qui delebit.</L></Q>
<P>But then, there seems to be a <HI>Consummation of all things,</HI> that must arrive, after a Number of Ages known to God alone. And, if there must come upon this World, a <HI>Substantial Destruction,</HI> it seems to be reserved until those <HI>Unknown Ages</HI> be rolled about, and the <HI>Great Day of Judgment</HI> has had <HI>Every Work</HI> brought into it.</P>
<P>There are many passages of this Impor∣tance, in the Writers of <HI>Primitive Christianity;</HI> That the World shall <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> suffer a Disso∣lution. In <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> in <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> in <HI>Lac∣tantius,</HI> there are many such passages. Tis e∣nough to recite the words of <HI>Hippolitus. Flu∣vius igneus Egrediens, cum furore, instar maris saevi, exuret Montes et Colles, et Mare delebit ac aethera ve∣lut Ceram inflammatione dissolvet.</HI> Yea, there are Praesages of this thing, in the Writing of Pa∣gan Antiquity. The <HI>Sibylline</HI> Oracles have it.</P>
<Q><L>Tunc ardens flavius Caelo manabit ab alto</L>
<L>Igneus, atque Locos consumet funditus omnes.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001559_0036_0FB3B10D02A14F30"/>And again,
<Q><L>Omnia Cessabunt, tellus Confracta peribit;</L>
<L>Sic pariter fontes, torrentes, fluminaque igni.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Justin</HI> quotes Verses of <HI>Sophocles,</HI> that foretel a <HI>Conflagration</HI> wherein <HI>All things will be utterly destroy'd, and neither Earth nor Sea, shall be found any where any more. Clemens Al.</HI> quotes Verses of <HI>Diphilus,</HI> that Sing the same Ditty. <HI>Ovid</HI> also tells us,
<Q><L>Esse quoque in fatis reminiscitur affore Tempus</L>
<L>Quo Mare, quo Tellus, correptaque Regia Caeli</L>
<L>Ardeat, et mundi moles operosa laboret.</L></Q></P>
<P>Yea, the Wicked <HI>Lucretius</HI> himself suspects,
<Q>Una Dies dabit Exitium.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, with the <HI>Stoicks</HI> it was a common Expectation.</P>
<P>I resume the proposal I was upon; Let the <HI>Rainbow</HI> bring to our Thoughts, the Cir∣cumstances of the Terrible Day, when <HI>all these things shall be dissolved.</HI> But at the same time, Oh! Let our Hearts be taken and weaned, from the Things of a World, which an hideous <HI>Fire</HI> shall one Day sieze upon. Let us not be bewitched with a World, that shall one Day be <HI>Burned.</HI> Think, and wish, at this rate. <HI>O my God, Let me have my Portion in those Durable Blessings, which the Last Fire can't reach unto; O my Saviour, I commit my self unto thee for my Safe∣ty in the Day when the Last Fire shall carry all before it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Fifth Article.</HEAD>
<P>Fifthly and Finally, I will present you with a whole <HI>Cluster</HI> of MEDITATIONS, which the <HI>Rainbow</HI> will very agreeably produce in a Serious Mind; and many of them, (which you will see when I mention them,) such as it has already produced, in the Pens of the Servants of God.</P>
<P>And here, first; I do not ask you, to fall into <HI>Basils</HI> Meditation; who, when he saw (for at that time of day, they would see <HI>no more,</HI>) the <HI>Rainbow</HI> appearing in <HI>Three Co∣lours,</HI> but <HI>One Bow,</HI> applied it unto the Doc∣trine of the <HI>Trinity; Three Persons,</HI> but <HI>One God.</HI> Christian, To Converse with the Great GOD, and very distinctly with each of the <HI>Three Persons</HI> in the God-head, is the very di∣stinguishing Spirit and Glory of Christianity. May this part of the Divine <HI>Asceticks</HI> be more Studied a more Practised! I confess, the <HI>Rainbow</HI> will do a Good Office, if it Excite such a Study and Practice; tho' this be not the Office it was firstly intended for.</P>
<P>Nor Secondly, was it intended for a Repre∣sentation of our Three Graces; <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Love.</HI> Yet I find some, drawn from the <HI>Three Colours</HI> which were all that Antiquity di∣stinguished in the <HI>Rainbow</HI> into a <HI>Tropological</HI> Meditation on the <HI>Three Graces.</HI> And it will do us no Hurt on this Occasion, to lift up our
<PB N="31" REF="001559_0038_0FB3B10FAB8BB868"/>
Hearts unto the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> with our Sup∣plications; <HI>Lord, Let me have an Holy Faith, and Hope, and Love, ever shining in my Soul!</HI></P>
<P>It has been on all hands agreed, That in the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> we have, the <HI>Mercy</HI> of our God, in Lively Colours Painted out unto us. And some will more Particularly have the <HI>Three Colours</HI> of <HI>Red,</HI> and <HI>Green,</HI> and <HI>Blue,</HI> in the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to intimate the sweet Mixture of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> accomplished by the <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> But it is a Prejudice to those <HI>Niceties,</HI> that the Co∣lours of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> are more than <HI>Three,</HI> This however, may, Thirdly, be a very Proper Meditation on the Sight of the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> It Proclames the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God unto a Sinful World. Yea, how <HI>Emblematically!</HI> It was noted by <HI>Am∣brose</HI> of old; That our God sayes, <HI>I will put my Bow in the Cloud.</HI> He sayes nothing of any <HI>Ar∣rows.</HI> Tis a <HI>Bow</HI> without <HI>Arrows.</HI> When we see this <HI>Bow,</HI> let us then call to mind the <HI>Mercy</HI> of our God; and with a Grateful Soul acknow∣ledge, Lam. III. 22. <HI>It is of the Lord's Mercies, that we are not Consumed; because His Compassions fail not.</HI> Indeed as the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is formed in a <HI>Cloud,</HI> (which <HI>Commenius</HI> observes,) <HI>a Luce in millies millenis diffluentu Nubis Guttulis div<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsimode reflexa:</HI> the <HI>Mercies</HI> of our God unto us, are far more than the <HI>Drops</HI> in that <HI>Cloud. Lord, How great is the Sum of them!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, holds out the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> like the <HI>Scepter</HI> of old, and invites the worst of men, to come in unto Him, with an Exercise of
<PB N="32" REF="001559_0039_0FB3B11125EAC1B0"/>
true Repentance. He sayes to the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> as in Jer. III. 12, 13. <HI>Go, and Proclaim these words, and say, Return, and I will not cause my Anger to fall upon you, for I am Merciful, saith the Lord: Only acknowledge thine Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>But then, there are two Circumstances of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> that carry much Admonition in them. And there also, are to be taken into your Meditation.</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Bow</HI> is only to be seen <HI>above the Earth.</HI> Accordingly, tis only in this Life, and while we are yet <HI>above the Earth,</HI> that we have our Opportunity to lay Hold on the <HI>Offered Mercy</HI> of God. <HI>Lord, They that go down into the Pit, cannot hope for thy Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Tho' the <HI>Bow</HI> has no <HI>Arrows</HI> upon it, yet the <HI>Impenitent</HI> will find, the Great GOD, has His <HI>Quiver full</HI> of them. The Great God has Treasures of Wrath, and fearful Reserves of Plagues for the <HI>Impenitent.</HI> He sayes, <HI>I will heap Mischiefs upon them, I will spend my Arrows upon them.</HI></P>
<P>I pass on, to take notice, in the Fourth place; of some <HI>Lessons</HI> which the <HI>Rainbow</HI> may give us, concerning the <HI>Covenant</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of our Saviour. Some of the most <HI>Judicious</HI> Men in the World, and such as have been the far∣thest from indulging and humouring a roving <HI>Fancy,</HI> have ye noted such Things as these. The <HI>Rainbow</HI> never fills a <HI>Circle,</HI> nor makes more than a <HI>Semicircle.</HI> The Kingdom of our Lord in His Church, has in this thing a Picture
<PB N="33" REF="001559_0040_0FB3B112A3565F18"/>
of it. It is part <HI>on Earth;</HI> part <HI>Above.</HI> Our Sa∣viour was <HI>on Earth</HI> when He Suffered for us, and began His Kingdom; He went up from <HI>Earth</HI> to <HI>Heaven;</HI> and will come down from <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth</HI> again. The <HI>Afflictions</HI> attending the Kingdom of our Lord in the World, and the <HI>Enemies</HI> not yet all wholly subdued, make the Condition of a <HI>Semicircle</HI> too agreeable unto it. The <HI>Circle</HI> will not be filled up, till the Kingdom shall be <HI>delivered up unto the Father,</HI> and <HI>God</HI> shall become <HI>All in All.</HI></P>
<P>And since the <HI>Rainbow</HI> is not a <HI>Perfect Circle,</HI> if <HI>Moreover the Servants</HI> of God are <HI>Warned</HI> from thence, of the <HI>Imperfection,</HI> which will at∣tend all <HI>Sublunary</HI> Things, we shall but go on to make an Improvement thereof, that some Wise Men have made before us. Look upon the <HI>Rainbow</HI> that wants <HI>Perfection,</HI> [its near∣ness to the <HI>Earth</HI> allows it not!] and say, <HI>I have Seen an End of all Perfection!</HI></P>
<P>But, Finally, Let our <HI>Meditation</HI> carry us over, to another World, that has <HI>it.</HI> The Ex∣cellent <HI>Alsted</HI> advises us, from the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to form a <HI>Meditation,</HI> of the <HI>Glory</HI> that shall be imparted by our Saviour, to our <HI>Bodies,</HI> at the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> After this manner he gives us the Noble Reflection. <HI>Si Deus per Solem in Nubibus Excitat tam Splendidum Meteorum, multo magis ipse tanquam <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Justitiae in Corpo∣ribus

nostris aliquando Progignet admirabilem Splen∣dorem.</HI> Our Saviour fetching up our <HI>Bodies</HI> into the <HI>Heavenly Places,</HI> will shine upon them, and communicate a <HI>Glory</HI> beyond that of the <HI>Rainbow</HI> to them; a <HI>Glory</HI> wherein, being <HI>Changed</HI> into the likeness of His <HI>Glorious Body,</HI> they shall <HI>Shine like the Brightness of the Firma∣ment;</HI> Yea, <HI>Shine like the Sun, in the Kingdom of our Father.</HI></P>

<HI>Roman Empire,</HI> down as Low as the conclusion of the <HI>Saracen</HI> Oppressions, and the <HI>Turkish</HI> Hosti∣lities; the very Period unto which we are now certainly arrived. Then there appears unto him, a <HI>Mighty Angel,</HI> in so Stately and so Splendid a Pomp, that many Interpreters can hardly allow Him to be any less a Person than our Great <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> Himself. He appears to Exhibit a <HI>New Scene</HI> of things Marvellous and very Amazing. And if <HI>this</HI> be the Period for the Appearance of such an Angel, I do a very <HI>Seasonable</HI> Thing this Day, in Showing Him among you. I dispute not, whether this <HI>Angel</HI> be our <HI>Saviour</HI> Himself, because He descends with a Glory too big and bright for any Creature; Or, whether He be a <HI>Created</HI> Angel; For, if He be <HI>so,</HI> yet He comes in the <HI>Name</HI> of our <HI>Saviour;</HI> and He comes with a Representation of that <HI>Glory,</HI> which belongs to none but our <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>The Design of the Descent made by this <HI>Migh∣ty Angel,</HI> is, to foretel, and bring on, a wonder∣ful <HI>Reformation</HI> of the World. If he appears in a <HI>Cloud,</HI> this must not be wondred at. There is a Super-celestial <HI>Cloud,</HI> which from the Begin∣ning has been Employ'd as a <HI>Symbol,</HI> and a <HI>Cover</HI> for the Majesty of our God, in His Appearance. Not only the <HI>Israelites,</HI> who were favoured some∣times with an actual view of something that be∣long'd unto that vast <HI>Cloud;</HI> but even the <HI>Pagans</HI> also, and their <HI>Poets,</HI> had some Tradition of it.</P>
<P>There is an Intimation in it, that there will be <HI>Unsearchable</HI> Circumstances, <HI>Unsearchable</HI> Dis∣pensations,
<PB N="39" REF="001559_0046_0FB3B11DE69B1650"/>
in His Appearances. And if thou wilt come unto us in <HI>Cloudy Times,</HI> O Glorious Lord, Thy will be done: Yet, <HI>Even so come unto us!</HI></P>
<P>The only Thing that we now Single out for consideration, is that <HI>Particular Glory</HI> of our Ap∣pearing Saviour; <HI>A Rainbow was upon his Head.</HI> The <HI>Rainbow</HI> is a well-known <HI>Meteor,</HI> often beheld, but not with Eyes Devout enough, among us in the <HI>Day of Rain.</HI> Perhaps, there is nothing in all the <HI>Meteorous Kingdom</HI> so very Beautiful. Such is the <HI>Beauty</HI> of the <HI>Meteor,</HI> that while the Heathen <HI>Mythology</HI> made it, <HI>The Daughter of Wonderment, Cicero</HI> makes it a matter of Wonderment that it was not Lifted in the Number of their Gods. Let those declaim on this <HI>Beauty,</HI> who can fetch a Text from the Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> that sayes, <HI>Look on the Rainbow, and Praise Him that made it; very Beautiful it is in the Bright∣ness thereof.</HI> That which it becomes us most of all to Ponder, is, That the Sovereign Creator of the World, has in His Wisdom Stamp'd a <HI>Sacramen∣tal Character</HI> on the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> He has Insti∣tuted the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> for a <HI>Sign,</HI> and <HI>Seal,</HI> of His <HI>Covenant</HI> with the World. All Christians are apprised of the Signification which the <HI>Ninth Chapter of Genesis,</HI> has left upon the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> for our perpetual Consolation; and as our As∣surance, that the World shall no more be <HI>Drown'd,</HI> as it was in the Days of <HI>Noah.</HI> Wherefore, our Saviour appearing to us, <HI>with a Rainbow,</HI> about His <HI>Head,</HI> Proposes to Preach this Joyful <HI>Doctrine</HI> unto us.</P>
<Q><PB N="40" REF="001559_0047_0FB3B120AD9C50B8"/>Our Glorious LORD, will Remember His Covenant with His People; Even in the most Cloudy Times, that are Passing over them.</Q>
<P>And this is the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which I am now to insist upon; I wish you had a more able <HI>Bar∣nabas,</HI> to insist upon it. My <HI>Doctrine,</HI> it may <HI>drop as the Rain;</HI> as the Sweet, and Small Rain from a <HI>Cloud,</HI> that has a <HI>Rainbow</HI> brightning of it. We may see <HI>Cloudy Times;</HI> Yea, we may appre∣hend such a <HI>Flood</HI> of Calamity, as will carry all before it; yet now, O People of God; You are a People in <HI>Covenant</HI> with Him; A Reliance on your <HI>Sacrificed Saviour,</HI> Secures your Title to His <HI>Covenant.</HI> O Now Look up to your dear Savi∣our. See, He appears to you, in your <HI>Cloudy Times,</HI> with a <HI>Rainbow about His Head.</HI> He de∣clares unto you, That He will <HI>Remember His Cove∣nant;</HI> He has not <HI>Forgotten to be Gracious.</HI> You shall not be <HI>Overwhelmed;</HI> The Evil Things, which threaten you, shall not be too hard for you. You shall, you shall be Gloriously Delivered.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> In the first Place, I will show the <HI>Rain∣bow about the Head of a Saviour,</HI> unto every <HI>Par∣ticular Believer</HI> on that Faithful Saviour. My Friend, Apply the Glorious <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to thy own <HI>Particular Condition;</HI> Thy Saviour invites thee to do so. I will venture to lay this down, as a <HI>Rule</HI> of Application. <Q>The <HI>Promises</HI> which belong to the whole Church of God, are the Portion of every <HI>Particular Believer,</HI> and he is
<PB N="41" REF="001559_0048_0FB3B12298E761A8"/>
welcome to make use of them, as far as ever he can find his own <HI>Case</HI> adapted in them.</Q> Ac∣cording to this <HI>Golden Rule</HI> of Faith, and of Fellowship, I now say; Believer; Dost thou not see <HI>Cloudy Times?</HI> I know, thou dost: There is no Believer, but what has his Times of <HI>Dark∣ness:</HI> No <HI>Child of Light,</HI> but what sometimes <HI>Walks in Darkness, and sees no Light.</HI> 'Tis often, often the Case of every Believer; Lam. III. 1, 2. <HI>I am the man that hath seen Affliction; He hath brought me into Darkness.</HI> He cannot understand the meaning of the Divine Dealings with him; he cannot see the Face of God favourably Shi∣ning on him; he cannot but fear a sad Issue of the Things which are breaking of him. His Temptations make it the <HI>Hour</HI> and <HI>Power of Darkness</HI> with him. He knows not what to do, nor what God intends to do. Perhaps it comes to that Extremity; <HI>Lord, Thou hast covered thy self with a Cloud, that my Prayer should not pass through.</HI> In so <HI>dark</HI> a Time, the afflicted Belie∣ver is afraid of a <HI>Flood</HI> that will totally over pow∣er him; that he shall <HI>perish in his Affliction.</HI></P>
<P>But now, <HI>Comfort ye, Comfort ye</HI> my Children, saith the Lord. Show my <HI>Rainbow</HI> unto them; Tell them, that I will be <HI>Ever mindful of my Covenant.</HI> The Children of God, may be sure, that in Remembrance of His Covenant with them, He will save them from the <HI>Floods,</HI> which threaten Destruction to them. Only, My Brethren, Be sure that you Remember one Direction; Psal. XXXII. 6. <HI>For this shall every

one that is Godly pray unto thee, in a Time, when thou mayst be found; Surely in the Floods of Great Waters, they shall not come nigh unto him.</HI> [One has thus given us the true sense of it. <HI>For this shall every Good man pray, when thou art to be found; And shall be safe in mighty Floods, when other men are drown'd.</HI>] I Will first of all show you, what the <HI>Comforts</HI> are, that May delight and support your Souls, and keep you from <HI>Sinking</HI> in the <HI>multitude of your Thoughts within you;</HI> The Com∣forts to be read in this <HI>Rainbow</HI> on the Head of your Lovely Saviour.</P>
<P>First. Have you a <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Adversity</HI> beating on you? Perhaps you may suffer a vast weight of <HI>Adversity;</HI> Troublesome Occurrences, Innu∣merable, Irresistble. The Roaring Billows of <HI>Adversity</HI> rolling in upon you, may make you cry out, <HI>Save me, O God, for the Waters are come in unto my Soul, I am come into deep Waters, where the Floods overflow me.</HI> Hear the Answer from the <HI>Rainbow.</HI> Ah, Thou <HI>afflicted and tossed with Tempest;</HI> Be thou <HI>Comforted:</HI> Thy Lord will step in and save thee. He will fulfil that Pro∣mise of His <HI>Covenant</HI> unto thee; Isa. XLIII. 2. <HI>When thou passest thro' the Waters, I will be with thee, they shall not overflow thee.</HI></P>
<P>Again; Does a <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Corruption</HI> rise in your Souls? Perhaps, the power of <HI>Corruption</HI> in you may be such, that you may think, <HI>I shall one day perish by the Hand of such or such a Sin! Lust</HI> may so prevail against <HI>Grace,</HI> that you can see no hope of <HI>Grace</HI> ever getting the Upper∣hand.
<PB N="43" REF="001559_0050_0FB3B1256A087F80"/>
O Soul, <HI>Mourning</HI> because of the <HI>Oppres∣sion</HI> of an <HI>Adversary that provoketh thee sore▪</HI> Mourn on, Mourn on; And then know, that the Spirit of God will <HI>dry up those cursed Waters.</HI> Tho' thy <HI>Grace</HI> be but a <HI>Spark,</HI> yet <HI>many Waters shall not quench it, neither the Floods drown it.</HI> Thy Saviour will fufil unto thee that promise of His Covenant; Rom. VI. 14. <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore; In the <HI>Assaults of Hell</HI> upon your Souls, does the <HI>Enemy come in like a Flood</HI> upon you? It may be the <HI>Powers of Darkness</HI> are pouring in upon you. Your Tempted Souls are exceedingly born down; disordered with hideous <HI>Injections;</HI> terrified at the <HI>Noise of the Water spouts.</HI> Yet, O Molested Christian; Thy Saviour, hath <HI>Set Bars</HI> to the Tempter; &amp; said, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and here shall thy proud Waves be staid.</HI> That promise of His <HI>Covenant</HI> shall be fulfilled unto thee, 1 Cor. X. 13. <HI>God is faithful who will not suffer you to be Tempted above what you are able.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; We read concerning <HI>The Floods of the Ungodly.</HI> Sometimes the Servants of God, are uneasy at the <HI>Power,</HI> the <HI>Number,</HI> the <HI>Malice</HI> of Men that are disaffected unto them. If they are Engaged in more notable <HI>Services</HI> for God, they may be Exposed unto the Rage of Wicked and Restless Men, which may make them afraid, left their <HI>Serviceableness</HI> be utterly Extinguished. There may be Times wherein <HI>Hell</HI> may be E∣vidently and Furiously broke Loose upon them. The foaming Waves of <HI>Hell,</HI> may dash, &amp; beat
<PB N="44" REF="001559_0051_0FB3B12731D66470"/>
against them, and make a Noise that reaches up to Heaven. Times when the <HI>Workers of Iniquity</HI> do as it were make an <HI>Insurrection,</HI> and <HI>bend their Bows to shoot their Arrows,</HI> even <HI>bitter words.</HI> How accommodated a <HI>Rainbow</HI> for such Times! What is the <HI>way, which, O Lord, thou knowest thy Servants use to take,</HI> in such Storms as these! They repair humbly, with Repentance, with Prayers, and with Tears, to their Compassionate <HI>Saviour.</HI> All their <HI>Opportunities</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> they put into His Gracious Hands. Lo then, <HI>then!</HI> they see the <HI>Rainbow</HI> about the Head of their Strong Friend in the Heavens concerned for them. He sends this Advice unto them, and the Promise is fulfill'd unto the surprize of all wise Observers; Isa XLI. 10, 11. <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; Behold, all they that were Incensed a∣gainst thee, shall be ashamed, and confounded.</HI> This, this was the Ancient Experience. <HI>The Floods of Ungodly men made me afraid. In my Distress I called upon the Lord, &amp; cried unto my God. He drew me out of the many wa∣ters; He delivered me from them which hated me!</HI></P>
<P>Finally; The Fate of <HI>Mankind,</HI> under the <HI>Law of Mortality,</HI> is thus described unto us; Psal. XC. 5. <HI>Thou carriest them away as with a Flood.</HI> Be∣liever, Thou also must in thy Fathers Time for it, be <HI>Carried away. Death,</HI> Death, is unavoida∣ble. But thy <HI>Head</HI> is always above <HI>Water;</HI> Thou shalt not always ly among <HI>the Dead.</HI> The Quickning Spirit of that <HI>Head</HI> will fetch out of the Grave, all that belong unto Him. When the <HI>Black Waters</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> have <HI>Compassed</HI> thee <HI>a∣bout,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="001559_0052_0FB3B12A2CB69820"/>
and the Depth <HI>has Clos'd</HI> thee <HI>round about,</HI> and thou art gone down <HI>to the Bottom of the Mountains;</HI> thou shalt not have cause to com∣plain, <HI>The Earth with its Bars is about me for ever!</HI> No, Thou wilt <HI>bring up our Life from Corruption,</HI> we know it, we know it, O Lord our God. Ah, Dying Believer; Thy Saviour who was once Dead, is Risen from the Dead. On the <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> about His Head, O Read what is written; <HI>Behold, I am alive, and I live for evermore. Because I live, thou shalt also live. Heaven,</HI> that high Seat of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> yea, an higher Heaven shall be the Seat of the <HI>Raised Believer</HI> too. The <HI>Risen Saviour</HI> will infallibly Raise the Believer. Child of God, Thy <HI>Sin</HI> has wash'd thee over-board. O <HI>cruel Wave!</HI> It layes thee in the <HI>Deeps.</HI> But the Hand of thy Kind Saviour will take thee up;— will pull thee up, and <HI>show wonders to the Dead;</HI>— Thou shalt <HI>Rise, and Praise Him!</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>A Marginal Note, will very agreeably come in, at the Bottom of this Page; and relate such a Passage as this.</P><P>Quickly after the Preaching of this Sermon, there died a Person of Shining Piety, a Christian of Uncommon Holi∣ness, Devotion, Patience, and Humility, Mrs. <HI>Abigail Whip∣po;</HI> Gloriously triumphing over the Sting of Death, &amp; the Fear of the King of Terrors. God marvellously blessed this Sermon, to produce and assist the Triumphs of a Soul, so sweetly winged for the Heavenly World. With Rapture she gave Thanks to Heaven, for these Consolations; Rap∣turously she cried out, <HI>O the dear Saviour, that I am now it see with a</HI> RAINBOW <HI>about His Head! I am sure He will Re∣member the Covenant, which He has helped me a Thousand times to lay hold upon! I am sure He will do me Good, according to His Co∣venant!</HI> I do with Pleasure, answer the Desire of some, to Preserve the Memory of such a Christian.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="001559_0053_0FB3B12B766A7B20"/>I will go on, and show you, Secondly; Some special <HI>Seasons,</HI> wherein you will do Excee∣ding well, to make use of these Comforts. And there are Especially <HI>Two</HI> such <HI>Seasons,</HI> that I will commend unto you. I shall sensibly Serve the cause of Piety, by commending of them.</P>
<P>First. On the Sight of the <HI>Natural <HI>Rainbow,</HI></HI> these comfortable Meditations on the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, and of Grace, will be very Seasonable. It is a real <HI>Fault</HI> in the People of God, that they can be Spectators of the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> with no more Proper, Holy, Heavenly Thoughts, pro∣duced in their Souls; A very Faulty <HI>Unthankful∣ness</HI> to our Great Saviour, who has placed it as His <HI>Bow</HI> in the <HI>Clouds,</HI> and said unto us, <HI>O my dear People, Do you Look upon that, as the Memorial of my Covenant!</HI> The <HI>Gospel of the Rainbow,</HI> is truly, One of the <HI>Desiderata,</HI> among the Sub∣jects that should be cultivated in the Church of God. At present, I will only say; The <HI>Covenant</HI> with our Father <HI>Noah,</HI> whereof we have the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> for an Obsignation, had such an Aspect upon the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that we may fairly be led by the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> to Remember the whole <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> in all the <HI>Very Great and Precious Promises</HI> of it. Concerning the <HI>Covenant</HI> which God has made with our Saviour, for the Redemp∣tion of His People; we read, Psal. LXXXIX 37. <HI>It shall be Established, as the Faithful Witness in Hea∣ven.</HI> By the <HI>Faithful Witness in Heaven,</HI> is meant, The <HI>Rainbow.</HI> Well then; when we have that <HI>Comely Work</HI> of God before our Eyes, Let us
<PB N="47" REF="001559_0054_0FB3B12D01FC1E20"/>
Entertain such Thoughts as these; <Q>May a Glo∣rious CHRIST be my <HI>Saviour,</HI> and my <HI>Surety,</HI> how Happy, how Happy, am I! My Sins will be cast into the <HI>Depths of the Sea;</HI> I shall not my self be cast thither for them. O my Soul, Be not thou <HI>cast down.</HI> Be not <HI>afraid of all thy Sorrows;</HI> Thy Lord will not leave thee to <HI>Sink</HI> in any of thy Sorrows. Tho' the <HI>Grave</HI> do Swallow me up, Oh! Let me not <HI>Fear to go down</HI> into the Grave; My Lord will <HI>Bring me up again!</HI> I see a <HI>Faithful Witness in Heaven,</HI> that puts me in Mind of an <HI>Established Covenant</HI> for such Blessings of Goodness.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly. When we see the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the Lord administred, these Meditations may be very Seasonably awakened. It is no small Advantage, to be minded of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which our God has made with our JESUS for us, and with us, in our JESUS. We are minded of this <HI>Covenant</HI> after an Excellent Manner, by the Administration of <HI>Baptism</HI> in our Congregations. God Sanctifies the Sight of this Administration, as well as the other <HI>Ordinances</HI> in the Assembles of <HI>Zion;</HI> and it is a Profane Folly to make light of a thing which God uses for an <HI>Instrument</HI> of so much Good unto the Souls of Men. As in any <HI>Sprink∣led Water,</HI> the <HI>Light</HI> easily causes a sort of a <HI>Rainbow,</HI> so in the <HI>Baptismal Water,</HI> we see the <HI>Rainbow</HI> about our Saviour; He there and thence calls to the Beholders; <HI>O my People, I will be ever mindful of my Covenant!</HI> Let our Glad Souls be Sensible of this. I mention it the
<PB N="48" REF="001559_0055_0FB3B12E6F821430"/>
rather, because I find, 1 Pet. III. 19. <HI>Baptism</HI> is made the Antitype of the <HI>Flood;</HI> unto which the <HI>Rainbow</HI> has Relation. The <HI>Old Man</HI> in us, is like the <HI>Old World;</HI> under a Curse. The <HI>Blood</HI> of our Saviour washing away the Guilt of our Sin; and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Saviour taking away the Life of our Sin; are both of 'em compared unto <HI>Waters.</HI> By these <HI>Waters,</HI> the <HI>Old Man</HI> is destroy'd in our Souls, as the <HI>Old World</HI> was by the Flood. The <HI>New Man,</HI> like <HI>Noah</HI> in the <HI>Ark,</HI> is by these Waters, <HI>Raised up,</HI> and brought nearer to God. In this Way tis, that the Blessings of the <HI>Covenant</HI> become our Portion. Sirs; When you see a Person <HI>Baptised</HI> in our Congregations; then think! <Q>O that Blessed <HI>Covenant!</HI> According to that, only my <HI>Sin</HI> shall be drowned; But I my self shall be <HI>Raised</HI> unto the nearest communi∣on with Heaven. Yea, a <HI>Resurrection from the Dead</HI> will be bestowed upon me!</Q></P>
<P>But thus I Leave every <HI>Particular Believer</HI> to his own Meditations, on his own share in the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> I am now to tell you, What a <HI>Messenger</HI> [Ex∣cuse and Indulge me if I make Reprisals of the Term, A <HI>Messenger</HI>] of Happy Tidings, the <HI><HI>Rain∣bow</HI> about the Head</HI> of the Saviour, is unto the <HI>Church in general,</HI> unto the whole <HI>Church of the Living God</HI> upon Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, for the <HI>Continuance of His Church in this World,</HI> and its Fruition of Bles∣sedness in a <HI>New World;</HI> this was included in
<PB N="49" REF="001559_0056_0FB3B12FE341D548"/>
the <HI>Covenant</HI> made with our Patriarch after the <HI>Flood.</HI> Our Holy God never gave the <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> for a Token, that He would preserve a World, only to be a Rendezvouz of <HI>Traitors</HI> &amp; <HI>Rebels:</HI> a Field for none but <HI>Wicked People</HI> to graze upon. The Preservation of the World, is, that so our Saviour may have an <HI>Elect Peo∣ple</HI> here Prepared for Him, and that anon there may come on a Revolution wherein the <HI>Whole Earth</HI> shall be filled with that People, and His Kingdom. You should Read this Glorious Thing written on the <HI>Rainbow</HI> with Capi∣tals! And hence this <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, is En∣grossed in those Terms; Isa. LIV. 9, 10. <HI>This is as the Waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn, that the Waters of Noah should no more go ever the Earth, so— my Kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my Peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</HI> We are fallen into <HI>Cloudy Times;</HI> and, The <HI>Floods have Lifted up, O Lord, the Floods have Lifted up their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; the Floods lift up their Waves.</HI> But we have a Lord with a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about His Head; and this our Lord is <HI>mightier than the mighty Waves of the Sea.</HI> You find me using some Expressions in the XCIII Psalm. <HI>I</HI> will go on, and give you a very Good Gloss on the last verse of that Psalm, which I find in a Late Version of it.</P>
<Q><L>Because thy Promises O Lord,</L>
<L>are very firm and sure;</L>
<L>Thy Beautiful and Holy Church</L>
<L>for ever shall endurs.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="50" REF="001559_0057_0FB3B132E09FAF40"/>O People of God, and you that have <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> coming into your Minds; Look up, Look up; see a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about the Head of your Sa∣viour; and hear that ravishing Voice come out of His Mouth; <HI>I will take a sufficient Care of my Church in the World. My Covenant for my Church, there shall be no breaking, no failing of it!</HI></P>
<P>And is not this the meaning of that Exibiti∣on? Rev. IV. 3. <HI>There was a <HI>Rainbow</HI> round about the Throne.</HI> Our JESUS is <HI>Enthroned</HI> in the Heavens; The Scepter of God is in His Hands; But He will so manage every thing, that His <HI>Covenant</HI> for the preservation of His Church in the World, shall be most punctually accomplished.</P>
<P>First. I will give you some <HI>Reasons</HI> why the <HI>Rainbow</HI> about the Head of our Saviour will not prove an <HI>Empty Show;</HI> but He will fulfil to His Church, the <HI>Covenant</HI> of His Mercy. Tis for such Reasons as these.</P>
<P>First. The Blessed God, is a most <HI>Faithful God:</HI> The <HI>God of Truth.</HI> Oh! Let our God <HI>be True,</HI> in our Praises of Him, and <HI>Every man a Lyar,</HI> that has the least Murmur of His being a∣ny other. In the midst of our deepest <HI>Lamen∣tations,</HI> we must own that thing; Lam. III. 23. <HI>Great is thy Faithfulness.</HI> He is the <HI>Unchangeable</HI> One. He makes a <HI>Covenant,</HI> and He <HI>Changes not;</HI> Therefore the Church to be preserved ac∣cording to His Covenant shall <HI>not be consumed.</HI> His Nature, and His Glory is that; Psal. III. 4, 5. <HI>The Lord is Gracious and full of Compassion; He will ever be mindful of His Covenant.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="001559_0058_0FB3B133AD1D5100"/>Again; Our Saviour with the <HI>Rainbow <HI>about His Head,</HI></HI> appears before His <HI>Father,</HI> as well as unto His <HI>People.</HI> The Eternal Father is the <HI>God of our JESUS,</HI> He is in <HI>Covenant</HI> with Him. Our JESUS, is the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> which is made for the People of God; it is made with Him. Our Saviour presents Himself before God, as the <HI>Mediator</HI> of the <HI>Covenant.</HI> He pleads the <HI>Cause</HI> of His Church; He pleads for its Preser∣vation. We are sure of that; Heb. IX. 24. <HI>He is gone into Heaven it self, now to appear in the pre∣sence of God for us.</HI> This <HI>Angel with the <HI>Rain∣bow,</HI></HI> if He who <HI>took not on Him the Nature of Angels,</HI> and He who is, <HI>Above all Angels,</HI> may be ever called, <HI>An Angel;</HI> He is the <HI>Angel of the Covenant;</HI> and I will add, He is the <HI>Angel of His Presence.</HI> In the <HI>Presence</HI> of the Eternal Father, He makes this Demand; <Q>O my Father, my Fa∣ther; The Church which I have dy'd for, it must, not be Lost; Oh! Let it Live Eternally!</Q></P>
<P>Lastly. The <HI>People</HI> of God, they Mind Him of His <HI>Covenant;</HI> they point Him to His own <HI>Rainbow.</HI> They are a <HI>Praying</HI> People. Be∣cause they see a <HI>Rainbow <HI>about the Throne</HI></HI> of Heaven, this Emboldens them to Approach the <HI>Throne;</HI> they come with Boldness unto it, as a <HI>Throne of Grace.</HI> They lay hold on all the <HI>Pro∣mises.</HI> The Cry of their Incessant <HI>Prayer</HI> to God is that; Jer. XIV. 21. <HI>O Remember, Break not thy Covenant with us.</HI> They are a People that also wait upon God in the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of His <HI>Cove∣nant.</HI> By attending on the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> they Ce∣lebrate
<PB N="52" REF="001559_0059_0FB3B135571BF078"/>
the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God; they sollicit for the performance of it. Yea, When they see those <HI>Commemorations of the Covenant</HI> in the Chur∣ches of the Lord, they Lift up their Hearts un∣to Him; <HI>O thou Great God, who keepest Covenant and Mercy; Remember thy Covenant of Mercy to thy People!</HI> And, I hope, the view of the <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> will now more than ever, have the like Improvement with them. The Glorious <HI>Hearer of Prayer</HI> will take notice of it.</P>
<P>I will proceed Secondly, to set before you, some <HI>Articles</HI> in the <HI>Covenant of Mercy</HI> to the Church, which are declared and confirmed un∣to us, by the <HI>Rainbow <HI>about the Head</HI></HI> of our Merciful Saviour. Be the <HI>Times</HI> never so <HI>Clou∣dy,</HI> and the <HI>Floods</HI> never so boisterous, never so mountainous, the Church of God, has the <HI>Ex∣pectations of the <HI>Rainbow</HI></HI> to Live upon.</P>
<P>They are such as these.</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Church cannot be drown'd.</HI> The Church of God may read that Motto on the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> Jer. XLVI. 28. <HI>I will not make a full end of thee.</HI> Our Saviour will always have a Church, yea, a <HI>Visible Church,</HI> in the World. Tho' it may fly for some Ages into the <HI>Valleys</HI> of <HI>Piemont,</HI> yet even there it shall be <HI>Visible.</HI> No <HI>Flood</HI> shall utterly swallow it up. A Number of People visibly Embracing the <HI>Truths,</HI> and obey∣ing the <HI>Laws</HI> of the only Saviour, will be always upon the Face of the Earth. We read, Psal. CXXV. 1 Of a <HI>Mount Zion, which cannot be re∣moved, but abideth for ever.</HI> I will not say, This
<PB N="53" REF="001559_0060_0FB3B136ABE13720"/>
was a Covenant for the Literal <HI>Mount Zion;</HI> for this has been Removed; the <HI>Hill</HI> was dug down, with a vast Labour of three years, in the Days of the <HI>Maccabaean Simeon.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> on certain Accounts of Policy, dug down their <HI>Zion</HI> with their own Hands. But, O <HI>Church</HI> of our Blessed JESUS, Thou art that <HI>Mount Zion.</HI> The most <HI>Ancient</HI> of all the Mountains, the most <HI>Lasting</HI> of all the Hills; Eternally Impregnable! No <HI>Flood</HI> can roll over the Top of the <HI>Holy Hill of Zion.</HI> There is a word in the BIBLE, which has been as an <HI>Ark</HI> for the Church of God, in the most <HI>Cloudy</HI> and Stormy Ages of it; That word, <HI>Mat.</HI> XVI. 18. <HI>I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</HI> I Incline to think, that our Saviour alludes to what occurred in the <HI>Flood</HI> which once <HI>Overthrew the Foundations of the Wicked.</HI> In that <HI>Flood,</HI> we read, <HI>The Fountains of the Great Deep were broken up;</HI> and, <HI>The Waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth; they prevailed, and the Mountains were covered.</HI> Yet the <HI>Family</HI> of the Just One perished not. Sirs, It will be so! Tho' the Bars of the Bottomless Pit should be <HI>broken up,</HI> and should pour out a <HI>Flood</HI> of Mis∣chiefs on the Church, yet there shall not issue out such a <HI>Flood</HI> from thence, as to drown the <HI>Family</HI> of our Saviour. The <HI>Flood</HI> shall not <HI>pre∣vail</HI> so far as to <HI>drown</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> in the World. Our Lord <HI>Sits King on the Floods,</HI> and sets Bounds to them; they shall not <HI>prevail</HI> to carry all be∣fore them. <HI>Had it not been for this Word,</HI> the Church had been <HI>drown'd</HI> in the Days of <HI>Dio∣clesian,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="001559_0061_0FB3B1382ADC7150"/>
when he set up his Pillars, with this In∣scription on them, <HI>Christiana Superstitione Deleta.</HI> Wretch, The Inscription on the <HI>Rainbow <HI>about the Head</HI></HI> of our Saviour, confounded thine! <HI>Had it not been for this Word,</HI> the Church had been drown'd by the <HI>Flood,</HI> which the <HI>Dragon cast out</HI> of his Mouth in the <HI>Arian</HI> Haeresies; when, <HI>The World Sigh'd, that it saw it self become al∣most entirely Arian. Had it not been for this Word,</HI> the Church had been drown'd in the <HI>Flood</HI> of the <HI>Romish Apostasy,</HI> at the Latter end of the <HI>Fifteenth Century;</HI> when there were left One Little Flock of <HI>Taborites</HI> in their <HI>Caves;</HI> and these poor <HI>Speculani</HI> sent four Agents to the several points of the Compass, to find, if it were possible, any pure Church in the World; and they all return'd with a Sorrow∣ful Report, That there was none to be met withal. Were it not for <HI>this Word,</HI> The Grand <HI>Assyrian</HI> of this Day would be Master of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and the Religion of Christ be every where Little better of it, than it is in his own Bloo∣dy Dominions. But O thou <HI>Monster of Base∣ness,</HI> The <HI>Daughter of Zion</HI> despises thee. And, O thou <HI>Troubler of the Nations,</HI> A Few Months more shall bring thee down to the <HI>Sides of the Pit,</HI> and it shall be said by them that Con∣sider thee, <HI>Is this the man that shook the King∣doms of the Earth!</HI></P>
<P>In short▪ The Church of our Saviour must <HI>Our live</HI> all the Attempts of Earth and Hell against it. The <HI>Story</HI> of the Church Surviv∣ing
<PB N="55" REF="001559_0062_0FB3B139DE51A478"/>
all the Attempts of its Adversaries in the former Ages, is a wonderful Story. The <HI>Threed</HI> of the Story shall never be broken off! Our JESUS will have <HI>Subjects,</HI> His <HI>Bible</HI> will have <HI>Students,</HI> His <HI>Spirit</HI> will have <HI>Temples,</HI> let all the Devils in Hell do what they can to defeat such In∣tentions of Heaven. The Saviour with the <HI>Rainbow <HI>about His Head,</HI></HI> will tread on the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Old Serpent;</HI> All the Plots in that <HI>Bruised Head,</HI> shall come to nothing!</P>
<P>Secondly. The most <HI>Cloudy Times</HI> that pass over the Church of God, have their <HI>Mixtures</HI> of Mercy, and of Moderation in them. There's a <HI>Rainbow;</HI> The <HI>Clouds</HI> of Wrath are not so thick, not so spread, but there is a <HI>Sun∣shine</HI> of Mercy with them. If the <HI>Floods</HI> rise high; yet not so high, that <HI>all</HI> shall be co∣vered; <HI>all</HI> overcome. It was a thing propo∣sed; Hab. III 2. <HI>O Lord, Revive thy Work in the midst of the years; In wrath remember Mer∣cy.</HI> His <HI>Church</HI> is His <HI>Work.</HI> In the midst of the Seventy Years assign'd for the Captivity of the <HI>Jews,</HI> they found a Remarkable sa∣vour from the Court of <HI>Babylon,</HI> in what was done to one who represented them there. This <HI>Revived</HI> them in the <HI>midst of the years;</HI> This was <HI>Mercy in the midst of Wrath▪</HI> Indeed things may go very bad, with the Church; yet never so <HI>Bad,</HI> but they might be <HI>Worse.</HI> O the amazing <HI>Supplies of Grace</HI> which are sent in unto the Church, under its greatest Languishments▪ There will be at least a <HI>bat∣tle
<PB N="56" REF="001559_0063_0FB3B13B23415078"/>
Reviving.</HI> What <HI>Ezra</HI> of old called, <HI>A Little Reviving to set up the House of our God.</HI> The Church will find that thing; Psalm LXXVIII. 38. <HI>He does not stir up all His wrath.</HI> The Church will find, the <HI>Saviour</HI> with His <HI>Rainbow,</HI> dealing according to that word; <HI>I am with thee, I will correct thee in measure.</HI> That word; <HI>He stays His Rough Wind, in the Day of the East Wind.</HI> The Calamities of the Church, have Glorious <HI>Mitigations.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Church</HI> can't be totally <HI>Drown∣ed:</HI> The <HI>World is;</HI> But the <HI>Flood of Wickedness,</HI> which overspreads the <HI>Whole World,</HI> is going off. We have a sad Account of this wretched World, 1 Joh. V. 19. <HI>The whole World lies in Wickedness.</HI> Alas, the <HI>Whole World</HI> is under that <HI>Flood,</HI> which we find before the <HI>Old Flood,</HI> and the Cause of it; we ought with unutterable Anguish, to make the Complaint, <HI>Behold, the Earth is corrupt before God, and all Flesh has corrupted his way upon the Earth.</HI> A <HI>Flood</HI> of wickedness, has laid Man∣kind <HI>groaning under the Waters.</HI> The <HI>Exceptions</HI> to the Epidemical, the Universal Wickedness of Mankind, are so very few, that we may still Complain, <HI>They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy!</HI> But, my Brethren; It shall <HI>not al∣ways be so.</HI> The Saviour of Mankind shows Himself unto us with a <HI><HI>Rainbow</HI> about His Head.</HI> It is to inform us, That the <HI>Flood of Wick∣edness</HI> in which the World is at this Day buri∣ed, shall one day be rolled off. Of the <HI>Angel</HI> coming down from Heaven with a <HI>Rainbow</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="001559_0064_0FB3B13DA62AB8B0"/>
<HI>on His Head,</HI> we read, <HI>He sets His Right Foot on the Sea, and His Left Foot on the Earth.</HI> Our Sa∣viour will come to take possession both of the <HI>Sea,</HI> and of the <HI>Earth.</HI> He will possess Himself of Mankind, both on the <HI>Sea,</HI> and on the <HI>Earth.</HI> He will assert His Dominion both on the <HI>Sea,</HI> and on the <HI>Earth.</HI> He will <HI>Chain</HI> up the <HI>De∣ceiver</HI> of the Nations. But, <HI>How Long, O Lord, Holy and True, How Long ere thou So come down unto us!</HI> There is a Day a coming in which, accor∣ding to the ancient Prophecies; Psal. XXII. 27. <HI>All the Ends of the World shall turn unto the Lord.</HI> And, Psal. LXXXVI. 9. <HI>All Nations whom thou hast made, shall come and Worship before thee, O Lord, and shall Glorify thy Name.</HI> Most certainly, There will come a Day when there shall be more <HI>Godly People,</HI> than there are now <HI>Wicked People</HI> in the World. I am certain, God will one day <HI>destroy them that Corrupt the Earth;</HI> We shall see an <HI>Earth</HI> wherein shall <HI>dwell Righteousness;</HI> it shall be filled with <HI>Righteous</HI> ones. The very first Time, that an <HI>Hallelujah</HI> occurs in the Sacred Scriptures, it is on this occasion; Psal. CIV. 35. <HI>Let the Sinners be consumed out of the Earth, and let the wicked be no more. Hallelujah.</HI> There will come a Time, when that <HI>Great Hallelujah</HI> shall be heard in the World!</P>
<P>Fourthly. Our Great Saviour, the <HI>Ruler</HI> of the World, aims at the <HI>Good of His Church,</HI> in all the <HI>Changes</HI> which He brings upon the World. This, is a very <HI>Turneable</HI> World; very <HI>Changeable.</HI> Others besides that King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Great <HI>Se∣sostrys,</HI> whom our Bible calls by the Name of <HI>Shi∣shak,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="001559_0065_0FB3B13FEC484DC0"/>
have seen a <HI>Wheel Turning about.</HI> Tis a most Elegant and Expressive <HI>Hieroglyphick,</HI> which our Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had of it, in his Vision of the <HI>Wheels.</HI> There is a Tradition, that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> invented his, from his Acquaintance with <HI>Eze∣kiels,</HI> who was his contemporary. He saw <HI>four Wheels.</HI> Will you give me leave to Say, That here is a <HI>Wheel</HI> for each of the <HI>Four Great Monar∣chies.</HI> The <HI>Last</HI> of them is now Turning apace. Our Immortal <HI>King</HI> is <HI>bringing the Wheel over that wicked Empire.</HI> Will you give me leave also to Say, That here is a <HI>Wheel</HI> for each of the <HI>Four Quarters</HI> of the World? Then besure <HI>America</HI> must be concerned in the Turning of the Last <HI>Wheel;</HI> and verily, we find it so to our Wonder∣ment. Well, but who has the Management of all these <HI>Wheels?</HI> Truly, Our Saviour with a <HI>Rain∣bow</HI> about Him? All the <HI>Angels</HI> in Heaven, who have their uncontroleable Influences on Humane affairs, are but the <HI>Officers</HI> of our Savi∣our; they Execute His Orders; they are the <HI>Ministers which do His Pleasure.</HI> We read how the <HI>Wheels</HI> are managed; Ezek. I. 26, 28. <HI>On the Throne, there was the Appearance of a MAN above upon it:</HI> [That MAN, tis our JESUS, tis our JESUS! We know, tis He!] It followes; <HI>As the Appearance of the Bow that is in the Cloud in the Day of Rain;</HI> [The RAINBOW!] <HI>So was the Appear∣ance of the Brightness round about.</HI> From our JE∣SUS on the Throne we are now so advertised; <Q>O my dear People, I remember my Covenant for you: And in all the Turns which I bring upon the World, I am fulfilling of it!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="001559_0066_0FB3B14132002008"/>This is HE, whom the <HI>Disciple that Jesus Loved,</HI> had His Allowance to Look upon!</P>
<P>But may <HI>We</HI> also at this Day, be allowed and advanced unto a View of that Glorious One! Yea, O People Highly favoured of the Lord; unto <HI>You</HI> does the Saviour with a <HI>Rainbow <HI>about His Head</HI></HI> give that Glorious Call; <Q>Behold me, Behold me, O my People; Behold, and Believe my Remembrance of my Covenant, in all the Cloudy Times that are passing over you.</Q></P>
<P>We are fallen into a Day, whereof we may say, what we read; Zech. I. 15. <HI>It is a Day of Trou∣ble and of Distress, a Day of Clouds and of Thick Dark∣ness.</HI> Yea, tis a Day wherein the People of God have their Fears, <HI>Lest the Waters overwhelm us, lest the Proud Waters go over our Soul.</HI> In the midst of these <HI>Clouds</HI> our Saviour appears to us, with a <HI>Rainbow <HI>about His Head.</HI></HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>first</HI> thing, with which I would ani∣mate my Brethren, is; That He is <HI>Our Head,</HI> and we may safely trust Him with <HI>Our All.</HI> On that Passage; Eccl. II. 14. <HI>A wise mans Eyes are in his head,</HI> I remember two of the Ancient <HI>Gregories,</HI> both a <HI>Greek</HI> one, and a <HI>Latin</HI> one, have a devout Gloss, which is rather an Allusion than an Exposition; Our Glorious <HI>Christ</HI> is our <HI>Head;</HI> and say they, in <HI>Him</HI> we have our <HI>Eyes.</HI> This I may very Rea∣sonably say; O <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord; Thy <HI>Eyes</HI> are in thy <HI>Head;</HI> Even in that <HI>Head</HI> which has the <HI>Rainbow</HI> about it. His <HI>Eyes</HI> will be on the <HI>Look-out</HI> for thy welfare: He will <HI>See</HI> to the fulfil∣ling of all that His <HI>Covenant</HI> has engaged for thee.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="001559_0067_0FB3B142B05EA8F0"/>What tho' there be dismal <HI>Clouds!</HI> The <HI>Clouds</HI> ga∣ther; Look very dismally; tis true. But, of thy Saviour, thou hast been told, <HI>Behold, He cometh with Clouds!</HI></P>
<P>I will go on to say; Tis a dreadful thing unto Good Men, to see such a <HI>Death</HI> upon all that is <HI>Good</HI> in the World. Every thing lies <HI>Dead: Zeal,</HI> tis Dead; <HI>Love,</HI> tis Cold &amp; Dead; The <HI>Life of Re∣ligion</HI> is gone. A <HI>Publick Spirit,</HI> its Dead; The <HI>Suc∣cess of the Gospel,</HI> seems Dead. <HI>Churches,</HI> Oh! how <HI>Cadaverous</HI> are they! What Putrefactions in them! O ye <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the Lord, you also, are either <HI>Dead,</HI> or at least have not got off your <HI>Grave-Cloathes.</HI> And yet, <HI>this</HI> may the rather be <HI>the Time</HI> for a Speedy Appearance of our Saviour. It was a Prediction; Mat. XXIV. 28. <HI>Wheresoever the Car∣case is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</HI> I take it for a Prediction of our Lords coming, with His Gospel, as the <HI>Lightning,</HI> to Ruine <HI>Antechrist,</HI> &amp; Reform His People. The Church at this Time; is to be like a <HI>Dead Carcase;</HI> partly so, by <HI>Sufferings:</HI> much more so, by <HI>Corruptions.</HI> Our Saviour will now come as a Glorious <HI>Eagle;</HI> so He did, when He brought His <HI>Dead People</HI> from <HI>Egypt</HI> of old. And, because He will use His <HI>Mighty Angels</HI> in what He is to do, marvel not, that you hear of <HI>Eagles,</HI> in the Plural Number for it.</P>
<P>And, yet; I judge it not amiss to acquaint you, That there is of late, within these few years, a most Surprizing <HI>Revival of Good Things</HI> in the World. Should I speak of but One <HI>Country;</HI> There are some strict observers of the Signs of the Times,
<PB N="61" REF="001559_0068_0FB3B1442723BAC8"/>
who have lately Published a <HI>Collection</HI> of Observa∣ble Things, wherein the Kingdom of God has been more sensibly opening it self in the Heart of <HI>Germany;</HI> Things of an Holy &amp; Hopeful Ten∣dency, to bring on a more ample Reign of <HI>Piety;</HI> The Collection contains no fewer than <HI>Fourscore and Four Articles.</HI> In many other places, there are some Excellent Things a doing. <HI>Essayes to do Good,</HI> begin to be in request. They grow more Fashionable, and Reputable. <HI>North-Britain</HI> will become a peculiar Seat, and Example of them. Among the rest, there is this to be observed; A <HI>Spirit of Association</HI> for Noble &amp; Pious Purposes, has of late begun Strangely to Visit the World; it be∣gins to do Wondrously. Some <HI>Societies</HI> perhaps are yet only laying <HI>Foundations,</HI> for purposes of a more Exact Regulation hereafter to be built upon. But as far off as in <HI>Switzerland</HI> they Prognosticate upon them; <Q>They annunciate a more Illustrious State of the Church of God, that is Expected, in the Conver∣sion of Jews &amp; Gentiles.</Q> These Things are the <HI>Rainbow <HI>of the Day!</HI></HI></P>
<P>In the next Place; I will freely confess to you, that there is not any One thing at this day a do∣ing, which I have my Eye more upon, than the <HI>Fate,</HI> &amp; I hope, the approaching <HI>Fall,</HI> of the <HI>Ottoman Empire.</HI> There is a Coincidence of more than as many things, to perswade us, That the <HI>Threchun∣dred &amp; ninety odd years</HI> allotted for the <HI>Turks</HI> to be the Plagues of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> Expired at the late Peace of <HI>Carlowitz.</HI> If that Empire should once fall, what a <HI>Jubilee</HI> would arrive to the poor
<PB N="62" REF="001559_0069_0FB3B1467580FDB0"/>
<HI>Greek Churches!</HI> Oh! Let us Pray more for them! Yea, the <HI>Jews</HI> as well as the <HI>Greeks</HI> would feel a quickening Energy upon it. Now, a mighty shake seems to be giving unto the <HI>Ottoman Empire.</HI> There are Millions of Oppressed Christians, who begin to see a <HI>Rainbow</HI> in that Thing, if God will please to give the Word. If it should be so, that the <HI>Ottoman Empire</HI> be falling, Then, Then, that <HI>Great Trumpet is going to be blown,</HI> which brings on the Kingdoms of this World, to be the <HI>Kingdoms of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I have one thing more to say. The Grandeur of <HI>Antichrist</HI> is plainly on a Decline. Yea, the <HI>Clouds</HI> of this day, are big with desolating <HI>Thunder-bolts,</HI> to be discharg'd upon him. The <HI>Twelve hundred &amp; Sixty years</HI> of the Papacy, could not commence much later than the year Four hundred &amp; fifty, or sixty. All Rational computations conspire to pro∣clame this; <HI>A Great &amp; Notable Day of the Lord is at hand;</HI> The Day is <HI>near, it is near, &amp; it hasteth greatly!</HI> The <HI>Papal Authority</HI> now Suffers a mar∣vellous Diminution; it is Irrecoverably diminish∣ed. Its <HI>Bulls</HI> roar very insignificately. Let it <HI>ful∣minate</HI> what it will, People do but <HI>Squib</HI> at it. The <HI>Spirit of Persecution,</HI> which where-ever tis found, is the <HI>Spirit of Antichrist,</HI> it is wondrous to see, how tis going out of the World; men grow Ashamed of it; They that would fain be at it, yet <HI>they</HI> also <HI>Occasionally</HI> acknowledge, That it is <HI>Contrary to the Spirit of Christianity.</HI> Some that have been most noto∣rious for it, Labour mightily to shift off the charge.</P>
<P>I greatly suspect, that we are fallen into the Pe∣riod,
<PB N="63" REF="001559_0070_0FB3B149577ABA18"/>
for the Effusion of the <HI>Vials,</HI> which brings the <HI>Last Plagues</HI> on the <HI>Papal Empire:</HI> It looks, as if the <HI>first</HI> of them, were newly dispensed; <HI>A Boyl on the Earth;</HI> A <HI>Pestilence</HI> on the <HI>Inland Parts</HI> of that Em∣pire. I tremble at the <HI>Second.</HI> — But they will all be <HI>Rainbowes of Hope,</HI> for the pure Wor∣shippers &amp; Followers of the Holy JESUS.</P>
<P>Finally; But must my poor NEW-ENGLAND, have no part in the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> about Him, that has hitherto been the <HI>Hope</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND, and the <HI>Saviour thereof in the Time of Trouble!</HI> Yea; And tho' there is no <HI>Particular Church,</HI> but what may be <HI>drown'd,</HI> yet I Suppose, tis not until it neglect the <HI>Rainbow,</HI> and by overgrown Im∣piety &amp; Impenitency forget the <HI>Everlasting Cove∣nant</HI> And, O poor Flocks in the Wilderness; will you do so? I confess, we are very criminal; and all out crimes have peculiar Aggravations. Yea, there are some very <HI>Base People</HI> among us; People who do things that <HI>Pagans</HI> would abhor to do; People who bring a Blemish on all the Country. But yet, first, the Body of the People, are a <HI>Sober, Honest, Well-instructed</HI> People. All <HI>Ci∣vil Travellers</HI> who do them Justice give them this Testimony. Then, there is also Scattered all over the Country, a Generation of Serious, Prayerful, Watchful <HI>Christians;</HI> many that make no Noise, are the Humble Favourites of Heaven; the <HI>Cha∣riots &amp; Horsemen of the Land,</HI> &amp; yet by their Mo∣desty almost <HI>Invisible.</HI> The <HI>Charities</HI> of these Christi∣ans, especially in this Town, they are going up as <HI>Memorials before God</HI> continually. There is like∣wise
<PB N="64" REF="001559_0071_0FB3B14A25216EA0"/>
a Set of <HI>Young Ministers,</HI> and Candidates for the Ministry, who are full of Goodness; Lovely Young Men; <HI>Sons of Zion, comparable to fine Gold; Nazarites, Purer than Snow, brighter</HI> than Pearl; <HI>their Polishing that of Sapphire.</HI> God grant the <HI>Rainbowes</HI> may Multiply! O Multiply our <HI>Tokens for Good.</HI></P>
<P>I will Conclude with Saying this thing▪ Me∣thinks, A <HI>Saviour with a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about His Head,</HI> should most movingly. Invite every Sinner to come in unto Him. I have read some-where, a Sorrowful Relation of a man who was a <HI>Drow∣ning,</HI> at the very Instant when he saw a <HI>Rainbow</HI> in the Sky before him; whereat he cryed out, <HI>Haec Iris, quid mihi proderit, si Ego peream.</HI> <Q>What Advan∣tage to me the <HI>Rainbow</HI> which secures the World from <HI>Drowning,</HI> if now I my self be <HI>Drow∣ned.</HI></Q> This I will say; O poor Sinner, what Ad∣vantage canst thou Expect from a <HI>Saviour with a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about His Head,</HI> if thou despise that Saviour, &amp; Provoke Him, to cast thee off! Where∣fore, Oh! Hearken to the Voice from the <HI>Cloud</HI> a∣bout the <HI>Glorious High Throne</HI> of our Saviour; <HI>Ah, Repenting Soul, I remember my Covenant of Mercy; I am ready to receive thee!</HI> Behold His <HI>Bow;</HI> there are no <HI>Arrows</HI> in it. But if any of you will <HI>go on still in your Trespasses,</HI> think on that word, Psal. VII. 11, 12, 13. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day; If he turn not, He has bent His Bow, &amp; made it ready; He ordains His Arrows against him.</HI> Verily, The <HI>Clouds</HI> about Him, will <HI>Pour down</HI> terrible <HI>Thunderbolts!</HI>—</P>
