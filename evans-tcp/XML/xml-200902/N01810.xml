<HEAD>A <HI>PREFACE</HI> Of the very Reverend Dr. <HI>Increase Mather.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN Mens <HI>Defaming</HI> their Neighbours (Es∣pecially such as have deserved better usage,) there is no Little Evil. Not only does our Saviour CHRIST instruct us <HI>to do as we would be done by,</HI> but the moral Philoso∣pher among the Gentiles, by the Light of Na∣ture, Says, <HI>Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne se∣ceris.</HI> Nevertheless, as Great an Evil as it is, many are guilty of it: And many of the Best and most Serviceable Men in the World, have been Exposed unto it. The Holy Prophets <HI>heard the Defaming of many.</HI> The Apostles of our Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST, being Defamed,</HI> yet Blessed those that were most Abusive to them. Nor was there ever any Man in the World mere <HI>Defamed,</HI> than He that has been
<PB N="ii" REF="002143_0004_0FBC22BAF930EE20"/>the <HI>SAVIOUR</HI> of it; who has taught His Disciples to <HI>Forgive their Enemies,</HI> to <HI>Bless those that Curse them,</HI> and to <HI>Do Good unto those that Hate them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>ESSAY</HI> now to be offered unto the Rea∣der was Printed at <HI>London</HI> Nine Years ago. But I never saw it until within these few Days; nor list I to Enquire after the Author. I find in it not only <HI>Erudition</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> but that which is a thousand times better, a Gospel Spirit of Real Piety: And that the Author (whoever he be) is a Person of Great Reading and Acquaintance with Learned Writers; and has made his Knowledge subservient unto his Religion. I have therefore advised the Re∣printing of it in <HI>Boston;</HI> Hoping that GOD will bless it, both for the <HI>Conviction</HI> of them who are concerned as <HI>Transgressors,</HI> and for the <HI>Confolation</HI> of them who may be concerned as <HI>Sufferers,</HI> by <HI>Defamations.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Occasion of the Ensuing ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT has been Earnestly wish'd by some, yea, it has been the</HI> first-born <HI>of their Wishes,</HI> That whatever special Temptation and Affliction befalls them, the Glorious Lord may have some Revenues of Glory; yea, and his People also some Revenues of Service from it. <HI>There are those who have seen their</HI> Desire <HI>in this Thing remarkably</HI> Accomplished; <HI>and it has been</HI> Sweet <HI>unto them; it has remarkably</HI> Sweetned <HI>the</HI> Bitter∣ness <HI>of all their</HI> Exercises. I would ye should understand, Brethren, that the Things which happen'd to me, have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel. <HI>But then, if we are at any time Exercised with Injurious</HI> De∣famations, <HI>why should not this</HI> Temptation <HI>and</HI> Affliction <HI>be improved as well as the Rest, and the</HI> Church <HI>of Christ, wherein the CASE occurs to</HI> all that will live Godlily, <HI>be Inte∣rested, (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we can attain to it) in the improve∣ment of it?</HI></P>
<PB N="iv" REF="002143_0006_0FBC22BD5D16A7C0"/>
<P><HI>It is a Pleasant Criticism of</HI> Cocceius, <HI>that the Church is Compared unto a</HI> Garden of Nutts; <HI>partly because Good Men must, like</HI> Nutts, <HI>be well</HI> knock'd <HI>and</HI> broken, <HI>before o∣thers can get that</HI> Good <HI>which is to be gotten out of them. If the Reader get any</HI> Good, <HI>by an</HI> ESSAY <HI>now put into his Hands, let him A∣dore the Faithfulness of the Glorious LORD, who Order'd a Servant of his, to be</HI> knock'd <HI>with some Calumnies and Reproaches; which awakened him, (instead of</HI> Answering <HI>and</HI> Confuting <HI>them, as 'tis Easy for him to do.) to set himself upon</HI> Strengthening his Bre∣thren <HI>with a Discourse on a CASE, wherein very many are concerned. It must be confess'd that he had also in this</HI> ESSAY, <HI>a very particu∣lar Eye to</HI> Another <HI>Servant of God, whose</HI> Watchfulness <HI>and</HI> Faithfulness <HI>and</HI> Industry, <HI>had not Excused him from</HI> unkind usage <HI>(which every wise Man looks for) in an</HI> Evil World. Plutarch <HI>wrote a Treatise,</HI> De Ca∣pienda ab hostibus utilitate; <HI>how</HI> to Profit by ones Enemies. <HI>But</HI> Plutarch <HI>was a Stran∣ger to such Maxims as this</HI> ESSAY <HI>is Compo∣sed of. And both the Author and his Friend, has great cause to take Satisfaction in the Di∣vine</HI> Providence, <HI>that has brought them forth, for the Service of the People to whom we owe our</HI> All.</P>
<P><HI>The Famous</HI> Dod, <HI>had been so greatly</HI> Defa∣med <HI>by an Officer of the</HI> College <HI>whereto he
<PB N="v" REF="002143_0007_0FBC22C05155A710"/>belonged, that his vexation upon it, threw him into a Fever. But God Sanctified it for so much</HI> Good <HI>unto him, that he sort for his</HI> De∣faming Accuser; <HI>and for the sake of the</HI> Good <HI>he had gained by him, heartily forgave him all the</HI> Wrong <HI>he had Suffer'd from him.</HI> Anon <HI>the Accuser himself saw and own'd his</HI> Error. <HI>If the Author of this</HI> ESSAY, <HI>may not only</HI> gain <HI>the</HI> Good <HI>propos'd in it; but also</HI> do <HI>the</HI> Good <HI>that is intended by writing of it; he will have Superabundant Reason to</HI> forgive <HI>those that have been abusive to him; yea, tho' instead of a smaller Number, and worthier of a better Name, their Name were</HI> Legion.</P>
<P><HI>Among other Assaults upon him, he has had first and last above a dozen</HI> Pamphlets <HI>Pub∣lished against him; unto any one of which, he never made the least Reply; except it were that which the University of</HI> Helmstadt <HI>lately made unto an Abuse put upon them,</HI> Vi∣sum est non alio Remedio quam generoso Silentio, &amp; pio contemptu, utendum nobis esse; (<HI>Silence and Contempt they thought the best</HI> Reply.) <HI>This</HI> un-replying Silence <HI>has not proceeded from the</HI> Weakness <HI>of his Cause, but from the</HI> Strength <HI>of it. For what loss of Time is it, [ill to be spared out of a</HI> Short Life!] <HI>to draw a</HI> Saw <HI>with a People who have no Rea∣son or Honour in them? Those</HI> Children of unreasonableness <HI>write nothing worthy of a</HI> Reasonable Man's <HI>Consideration. They them∣selves
<PB N="vi" REF="002143_0008_0FBC22C297BFBE10"/>arm the Considerate Reader with their own</HI> Refutation; <HI>To</HI> Recite <HI>what they say is to</HI> Refute <HI>it. The</HI> Men, <HI>and their</HI> Pens <HI>have been such, that still when his</HI> Adversary <HI>has</HI> written <HI>a Book; he might well</HI> take it upon his Shoulder, and bind it as a Crown <HI>unto him.</HI> The Invectives <HI>of such People, we have been taught by an</HI> Arch-Angel; <HI>how little</HI> Notice, <HI>and with what</HI> Patience, <HI>is to be taken of them. And sometimes there is occasion to think, how</HI> Maximus Tyrius <HI>resolves the Case;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Whether being Injured, we may make a Return or no? <HI>Says he;</HI>
<Q><HI>Tis not at all convenient, that an</HI> Ho∣nest <HI>Man should</HI> Wrastle a fall <HI>with one of another Character; for they were not brought up under the same</HI> Tutors, <HI>or unto the same</HI> Exercises, <HI>nor do they expect the same</HI> Success <HI>or</HI> Applause <HI>of what they do; so that,</HI> mise∣ret me ejus Pugnae, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> im∣par est congressus.</Q> <HI>All that he does is this. At the taking of</HI> Cadiz, Fort Philip, <HI>and all the</HI> Spanish <HI>Galleys fir'd on Sir</HI> Walter Ra∣leigh <HI>in the Van of the</HI> English <HI>Navy;</HI> Ra∣leigh <HI>scorned their Fire, and answered with a</HI> Flourish of Trumpets, <HI>without shooting a Gun, till he saw his Time, and then did notable Exe∣cution. He takes leave to say; he will not once Fire on any Libellers and Revilers. He wishes what is here exposed, may be as accep∣table a melody to good Men as a</HI> flourish of
<PB N="vii" REF="002143_0009_0FBC22C35DB875A0"/>Trumpets. <HI>There may come a Time for such things to be done, as may render the Adversa∣ries</HI> ashamed <HI>of their Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>veness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>One who is not the most unexceptionable Au∣thor in the World, tho' a mighty</HI> Clerk, <HI>a ve∣ry great Scholar and Writer, [Monsieur</HI> Le Clerc] <HI>has written a Discourse beyond all Exception, upon that Problem,</HI> An semper Respondendum Calumniis Theologorum; <HI>or whether the</HI> Calumnies <HI>of</HI> Divines, <HI>written against a Man, are always to be Answer'd by him. He wisely Answer's;</HI>
<Q><HI>No, by no means, 'tis perfect</HI> loss of Time. <HI>Do you go on writing of such</HI> Books <HI>as will be of last∣ing Benefit to Mankind. Those</HI> Books <HI>will be your sufficient and perpetual</HI> Vindicati∣on, <HI>The</HI> Sober <HI>part of Mankind, will be so far from regarding the</HI> Calumnies <HI>Published against you, they will but</HI> abhor the Pub∣lishers.</Q></P>
<P><HI>This agrees well with what</HI> Sarracius <HI>wrote unto</HI> Salmafius, <HI>when he</HI> threw away his Time <HI>in answering the many Books written against him:</HI> Non dubito quin te aculeate dicta angant, quietemque tuam perturbent, sed semel te oportet, claudere Aures omni∣bus illis maledictis, hominesque ulcisci, Compos<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ione operum, que te digna sint. <HI>A noble Revenge truly! To</HI> say nothing <HI>unto the Calumniaters: but to</HI> write something, <HI>that mankind shall be the better for.</HI></P>
<PB N="viii" REF="002143_0010_0FBC22C4DC5B3378"/>
<P><HI>If</HI> Divines <HI>writing against a Man (which none such ever did yet against the Author of this</HI> ESSAY, <HI>that he has been sensible of,) are so little to be Regarded, what then are Men who proclaim themselves little better then</HI> A∣theists, <HI>and the Prophane Pamphlets, by</HI> such Men <HI>darted against him?</HI> The Dirt of a STREET as little to be Regarded!</P>
<P><HI>Vertuous Men it seems have had that Opini∣on of a Paper which I have seen, dispers'd a∣mongst a People so instructed, and so disposed, that in a little more then one Weeks time, it was with very near an</HI> Universal Abhorrence, <HI>chased out of the World. It strangely</HI> disap∣peared <HI>at once, and hardly any one Man would so expose his own Reputation as to be known to countenance it. That</HI> Atheiftical Paper, <HI>had a Collection of gross and vile</HI> Fals∣hoods, <HI>wherein the Author of this</HI> ESSAY <HI>is</HI> Belyed, <HI>with an uncommon degree of</HI> Malig∣nity. <HI>He has been at a Loss, about a proper Conduct on this Occasion. On each of the Pas∣sages, (which traduce him in the Points where∣in if he ever did well, and as became an</HI> Honest Man <HI>in his Life, it was in those Points!) He might give the Answer, which honest</HI> Vale∣rius magnus, <HI>thought it enough to repeat on every Charge which his Adversary then falsly made upon him;</HI> Mentiris impudentissime: <HI>'Tis a</HI> most impudent <HI>Lye! But on the one side, had he consulted</HI> Flesh <HI>and</HI> Blood, <HI>the
<PB N="ix" REF="002143_0011_0FBC22C661B75518"/>Cry would have been,</HI> Nos haec Patiemur i∣nulti? <HI>An</HI> Aristotle <HI>would have told him,</HI> It is a Slavish thing, when we are used Con∣tumeliously to suffer it without making Re∣turns. <HI>An</HI> Isocrates <HI>would have told him,</HI> You must think it a Base thing to be out∣done by your Enemies in Ill turns, as by your Friends in Good ones. <HI>As</HI> Terence <HI>taught us at School that Evil Maxim:</HI> Vete∣rem serendo injuriam invitas Novam. <HI>And should he employ an Hundreth part of that</HI> Ar∣mour of Righteousness, both on the Right Hand, and on the Left, <HI>that is, both</HI> Defen∣sive <HI>and</HI> Offensive, <HI>wherewith he is furnished on this occasion, the poor men could not but</HI> repent <HI>of their having medled with him. On the o∣ther side,</HI> Christianity <HI>prescribes a world of</HI> Silence, <HI>and</HI> Patience, <HI>and</HI> Goodness, <HI>upon such Provocations; and we have an admirable Saviour and Pattern, who,</HI> as a Sheep before the Shearers is dumb, so he opened not his Mouth. <HI>He resolved therefore to treat that Libel with Silence, and as</HI> unworthy of an Answer; <HI>God rewarded his Resolution, and also supplied him with an</HI> Answer, <HI>in the</HI> Con∣science <HI>of every Man who had any real</HI> Vir∣tue <HI>or</HI> Honour <HI>in him. Indeed, if a Man were not altogether so richly</HI> favour'd <HI>of the Lord abroad, it were no little Favour to have that</HI> within <HI>which may comfort him, in the</HI> Testimony <HI>of his</HI> Conscience. <HI>It was a plea∣sant</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="002143_0012_0FBC22C805619428"/>Answer <HI>from an honest Man unto a passi∣onate Lord, after he had patiently heard him call him abundance of bad Names;</HI> Your Ho∣nour may speak as you please, but I believe not one Word of it; for I know my self to be an honest Man. <HI>However this was the course taken by him. He knew no person of the least Credibility in the World would ever assert such things to his</HI> Face, <HI>or in his</HI> Life; <HI>and should he but meerly mention the Names of those</HI> Blades <HI>who divulged the</HI> Libel, <HI>this alone would be (tho' his own sufficient Vindi∣cation,) yet such an exquisite piece of</HI> Re∣venge <HI>upon his</HI> Enemies, <HI>as is not agreeable with his</HI> Principles. <HI>Wherefore he remains wholly</HI> silent <HI>for the present. But lest, after his</HI> Death, <HI>any wicked Men should go on, to make Advantage of such things, as they have done by his Renowned Grand-Father before him, he leaves behind him such</HI> well-attested Instruments <HI>in Manuscript, as being produ∣ced, will forever</HI> bury <HI>in confusion all at∣tempts, to wound Religion by wounding a Ser∣vant of it. We may &amp; should speak upon some Wrongs; not for the revenging our selves, but for the suppressing of Lyes that may hurt our Usefulness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the mean time, he would be loath to come short of a</HI> Musonius (<HI>commended for it by</HI> Grotius) <HI>who protested, he would never</HI> Sue any Man <HI>upon an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, upon an</HI>
<PB N="xi" REF="002143_0013_0FBC22C979632980"/>Action of Defamation, <HI>or suffer another to do it on his behalf. He may go on in doing all the</HI> good Offices <HI>for his People that he can; he is</HI> invulnerable. <HI>Some Names are so</HI> Oil'd <HI>that no</HI> Ink <HI>will stick upon them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was the Counsel of</HI> Sadoletus <HI>to</HI> Erasmus, Te ita crebro, &amp; a tam multis peti, &amp; mi∣rum sane mihi, &amp; Permolestum est. Nec video, quae sit causa, nisi existimatio tua, quae in tam alto sita est loco, ut omnibus flatibus Invidiae, Proposita esse videatur; sed ego si isto loco essem, una semel defen∣sione in universum omnibus responderem, Hoc opere edito, Perenne mihi silentium susciperem, adversus malevolos; Querum insolentiam iniquasque Calumnias, cum Res ipsa, &amp; veritas, tum tua Excellens Fama, virtusque Refutaret. <HI>You see, he Counsels him to</HI> Answer once for all, <HI>and let</HI> one Book <HI>be a full and final Answer to all the</HI> Calumnies <HI>that should be cast upon him. 'Tis hoped that the Author of this</HI> ESSAY <HI>will have no need of any other Answer to</HI> Calumnies. <HI>This</HI> one Book <HI>is Answer enough; after</HI> this, <HI>he need never trouble himself about any more; he may go on in the</HI> better Work <HI>which his</HI> Hand finds to do, <HI>and</HI> not turn aside for any.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>I Remember, <HI>Castellio</HI> writing a little Trea∣tise, <HI>de Calumnia,</HI> he gives a mark by which to know <HI>Calumnious</HI> People; <HI>Si illum Libellum suum ferre nequirent,</HI> That is, if <HI>his little Book disturbed them.</HI> 'Tis possible, there may be some so <HI>Envious,</HI> that this <HI>lit∣tle Book</HI> will disturb them, tho' written with all possible modesty, and concealment of the Author. It will be a disturbance to them, that an Author whom they love not, should be thought an Honest Man in the main, or do any Good in the World. Certainly such Persons will approach near the Character of <HI>Calumniators.</HI> I will only say, I do not know many Distempers of the <HI>Body,</HI> but what a Good Man would rather chuse to suffer, than to be distempered with such a depra∣vation of <HI>Mind,</HI> as these <HI>People</HI> are under the Power of! <HI>Lord! deliver me from such unreasonableness!</HI></P>
<P>There is a well-known Sett of Men, con∣cerning whom the Author might with <HI>Job</HI> complain, <HI>They raise up against me the ways of their Destruction;</HI> that is to say, I am, as I may say, the Beaten Path of their perni∣cious Reproaches. But when that Just Man made it his complaint, <HI>I am a Brother to Dra∣gons,</HI>
<PB N="xiii" REF="002143_0015_0FBC22CC5C7BE690"/>he found his Account in the <HI>True way of shaking off a Viper.</HI> Had his Exemplary <HI>Patience</HI> been even better than it was, it would not have been the <HI>worse</HI> for him, when GOD <HI>blessed his latter end.</HI></P>
<P>How many <HI>Diseases</HI> has the Practice of all Ages cured with <HI>Vipers?</HI> Our Dispensa∣tories fetch noble Medicines from them. <HI>Italy</HI> saw a <HI>Leprosy</HI> cured, by the poor <HI>Le∣pers</HI> casually falling into a Cave, which was filled with the Breath of the <HI>Vipers</HI> rende∣vouzed there. I have my self made a fine Anodyne and Febrifuge, with the <HI>Gall of Rattle-Snakes.</HI> The main study of the Au∣thor is, To get his own Heart &amp; Life healed of all that he can find amiss in it; by the Exercise of PIETY, which the Sibilations of Slanderers, may excite him to.</P>
<P>And now, he calls to mind, what the Pa∣tient Servant of GOD said; <HI>Had my Ad∣versary written in a Book, surely I would hind it as a crown unto me.</HI> Honest Mr. <HI>Terry</HI> tells us; when an Eastern Emperor sends any Letters with commands unto a Gover∣nour, he rides forth with Attendents, to meet the Letters; he lights, and falls to the Earth, and so takes them from the Messenger, and <HI>lays them on his Head,</HI> and <HI>binds them fast;</HI> and then returning to the place of Publick Business, he reads the Letters, and he does what they come for. If it should be so,
<PB N="xiv" REF="002143_0016_0FBC22CFA394B420"/>that any <HI>Adversary write a Book,</HI> to expose him with Detrectations &amp; Scurrilities; he will consider it, as bringing <HI>Letters</HI> to him (<HI>howbeit</HI> the Libeller <HI>means not</HI> so!) from the Glorious King of Heaven; and he will find out, and follow and obey the Orders of Hea∣ven in such a dark way sent unto him. This will be all his <HI>Answer</HI> to them, GOD will make THIS a Sufficient and Eternal Con∣futation to them!</P>
<P>In this Country a Native anointing him∣self with the <HI>Fat</HI> of <HI>Snakes,</HI> becomes Invul∣nerable and Impenetrable to the <HI>Sting</HI> of <HI>Snakes;</HI> He can handle them securely; They'l coy'l about him, unable to do any Harm unto him. <HI>Reader,</HI> Thou hast hear, an <HI>Axungia Viperina</HI> prepared for thee.

<HEAD>THE True way of Shaking off a <HI>VIPER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is a CASE which all <HI>good Men,</HI> that ever were of any Con∣sideration in this <HI>Evil World,</HI> have had occasion to take into their own most serious Consideration. A CASE it is, whereto a <HI>right Answer</HI> cannot but be acceptable to all <HI>Good Men;</HI> cannot but be serviceable to exert and increase their <HI>good∣ness,</HI> and bring about the <HI>Glory</HI> of HIM that has adorned them with it.</P>
<P>The CASE is,</P>
<P><HI>What should Good Men do when they are E∣vil spoken of?</HI></P>
<P>Or, <HI>What should be the Conduct of a Christi∣an, when Defamations are ordered for him, to Exercise his Christianity?</HI></P>
<P>Upon this <HI>general Case of all Good Men,</HI> the FIRST thing that I would propose is this; Let the <HI>defamed Christian</HI> set himself imme∣diately
<PB N="2" REF="002143_0018_0FBC22D262E8E3C0"/>to <HI>Consider,</HI> what <HI>his carriage ought now to be.</HI> My Friend, Be more solicitous to <HI>do well</HI> under <HI>Defamations,</HI> and <HI>be</HI> the <HI>bet∣ter</HI> for them, than how to <HI>vindicate</HI> your self against them. Let this be the <HI>first care</HI> on this occasion. Immediately pour our your fervent Supplications before the glori∣ous GOD. <HI>Lord, Enable me now to glorify thee, Oh! leave me not to any Frowardness or Foolishness, that may dishonour thy Name, when my own has dishonour cast upon it.</HI> Immedi∣ately set your self to study, and contrive, <HI>What is that behaviour wherewith I must now endeavour to glorify God?</HI> Study and con∣trive, <HI>What shall I do, that I may in the Issue find that I have cause to bless the Name of God, for those very things, wherein mine seems to be Wounded?</HI> When a scurrilous Person once notoriously abused a very vertuous Person, the wronged and patient Servant of the Lord said, 2 Sam. 16.12. <HI>It may be the Lord will look upon mine affliction, and that the Lord will requite me Good for his Cursing this Day. Truly,</HI> if you do after this manner <HI>begin</HI> your encounter with <HI>Defamations,</HI> 'tis be∣yond any, <HI>it may be,</HI> that the Lord will <HI>Re∣quite you good</HI> for the <HI>Cursing</HI> of your Friend <HI>Shimei;</HI> He has <HI>already</HI> done you that <HI>good</HI> which abundantly makes amends for all the <HI>Cursing;</HI> you are most <HI>certainly</HI> in the way of coming at <HI>good</HI> that will surpass all Ima∣gination.
<PB N="3" REF="002143_0019_0FBC22D3E55A7C18"/><HI>Blessed, Blessed of the Lord</HI> art thou, Oh! thou <HI>Cursed</HI> of them that have <HI>Blessings far from them!</HI> Having proposed and premised this Blessed <HI>Introduction</HI> to all manner of good, I will proceed unto a more particular description of a <HI>defamed Christian pursuing the Honour of Christianity.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Acknowledge the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God, and not only <HI>this</HI> but the <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of the <HI>Sovereign</HI> GOD, in all the <HI>wrongs</HI> which the <HI>defamatory invectives</HI> of any Man, may offer you. If <HI>Dirt</HI> be cast upon you, my first Advice to you is, what was once given to the Prophet, <HI>Go down to the House of the Potter.</HI> Adore the uncon∣troulable <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God which may make you a <HI>Vessel of Dishonour,</HI> on a much worse account than that of being a little <HI>reproached,</HI> by some in whose <HI>Reproaches,</HI> perhaps a Man is really <HI>Honoured.</HI> With a most profound Adoration of the Divine <HI>So∣vereignty,</HI> confess, that if God single out <HI>you,</HI> to be made an Object of numberless <HI>Indig∣nities</HI> and <HI>Malignities,</HI> and satisfy himself, in beholding what is done to you, and <HI>by</HI> you under them, <HI>there is nothing to be mur∣mured at.</HI> For ever submit, yea, tho' the dispensations of <HI>Sovereignty</HI> be never so dark, mysterious, unsearchable; and with all possible submission, say; <HI>Lord, I am will∣ing to be whatever thou wilt have me to be; do
<PB N="4" REF="002143_0020_0FBC22D5ACA2FC98"/>what thou wilt with my Name; if thou wilt have it vilified, let it be so; only let thy Name for ever be glorified.</HI> I may tell you, this <HI>Re∣signation</HI> will have admirable consequences. It had so, when a Servant of God oppressed with a world of obloquies, thus resigned himself; 2 Sam. 15.26. <HI>If the Lord say, I have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him!</HI></P>
<P>To the confession of <HI>Divine Sovereignty,</HI> let there be added a confession of the <HI>Divine Righteousness.</HI> As you are a <HI>Creature,</HI> you must allow <HI>Sovereignty</HI> to lay you <HI>low.</HI> Be∣cause you are also a <HI>Sinner,</HI> you must not wonder, if <HI>Righteousness</HI> make you <HI>vile.</HI> Fol∣low the example of the brave Emperour <HI>Mauritius,</HI> who being strip'd of his <HI>Purple,</HI> and run down into the most abject and wretched Circumstances, lift up his Eyes to Heaven, and only said, <HI>O Lord, thou art Righteous, and Righteous are all thy Judg∣ments!</HI> It is most certain that there cannot be the least wag of a <HI>Tongue,</HI> or <HI>scratch</HI> of a <HI>Pen</HI> against you, but it is permitted by God. Of your most Calumnious Adversary, you may say as that Great Man did of his abu∣sive <HI>Shimei;</HI> 2 Sam. 16.11. <HI>The Lord hath bidden him!</HI> It will be but a due compliance with the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of God, for you to confess before him, <HI>That He is infinitely just, in the greatest Injustice that any reproachful
<PB N="5" REF="002143_0021_0FBC22D828D8A658"/>Man can offer you.</HI> You know so much amiss by your self, that if it were all known abroad in the World, they who now <HI>falsly speak</HI> what is <HI>ill</HI> of you, might very <HI>truly speak</HI> what is a great deal worse. Make your <HI>Defamations</HI> a provocation unto you, to humble your self deeply before God for the <HI>secret Sin,</HI> which by leaving you to be <HI>defamed,</HI> you may see, <HI>he sets in the light of his Face.</HI> Under the Law of Ceremonies, if he that had an <HI>Issue</HI> did <HI>spit</HI> upon another, the Person <HI>spat</HI> upon was thereby <HI>defiled:</HI> Sir, if an <HI>unclean Wretch</HI> have <HI>spit</HI> upon you, it becomes you to enquire, Whether you have not upon you some <HI>De∣filement</HI> that is to be washed off, and make a new flight to that which will <HI>cleanse from all Sin.</HI> Perhaps you are at a loss, <HI>What may be your more special Sins which are scourged by God, in the Reproaches which are cast upon you.</HI> My Friend, It were a very proper thing for you, upon the first blowing up of any <HI>Storm</HI> of Obloquies, presently to fall down before the Lord with this Petition; <HI>Lord, Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</HI> And then go on with an impartial <HI>in∣quiry,</HI> a Self-judging, a Self-loathing <HI>inquiry. Nisi essent peecata, non essent flagella.</HI> I am sure there will need no long Divination, to bring you unto this one sensible stroke of Repentance; <HI>Lord, I have not Honour'd thy Name as I ought to have done, and therefore
<PB N="6" REF="002143_0022_0FBC22DA60A237B0"/>thou art Righteous in all the dishonour that my Name labours under.</HI> Had we been more concerned for the <HI>Name</HI> of God, who can tell, but He would have been more concerned for <HI>ours?</HI> When you go on, it may be you will find, that you have not always been so tender of your Neighbours <HI>good Name,</HI> as you should have been, or so <HI>cautious</HI> of making right, fair, <HI>exact Representations,</HI> when he has been spoken of. At least, when you have heard a Neighbour with too much <HI>Truth,</HI> ill spo∣ken of, there has not been that <HI>grief</HI> in you, and that <HI>Leve which rejoyces not in Iniquity,</HI> as there should have been. The Injuries done to your <HI>Name,</HI> are it may be to <HI>Chasten</HI> you, for this too common miscarriage. <HI>Be∣hold therefore the Goodness &amp; Severity of God! Severity,</HI> in his not leaving such a most fre∣quent fault without <HI>Chastening.</HI> But <HI>Good∣ness,</HI> because <HI>you are Chastened of the Lord, that you should not be condemned with the World,</HI> and in another World. Or, 'tis possible you may have treated some very impious and vicious Persons with too much of <HI>Complai∣sance</HI> and <HI>Complement;</HI> tho' your design might be nothing under Heaven, but only to win upon them, that you might do them <HI>Good,</HI> and make them <HI>Good,</HI> and bring them to do <HI>Good;</HI> yet you may have indiscreetly sorgotten the <HI>last</HI> of the <HI>Proverbs</HI> of <HI>Solo∣mon.</HI> God may therefore correct this indis∣cretion
<PB N="7" REF="002143_0023_0FBC22DB626EA2E0"/>of yours, by making <HI>such Persons</HI> to be the <HI>Instruments</HI> of bringing very great <HI>Reproaches</HI> upon you. Briefly, Carry on the Scrutiny with all the accuracy imaginable, to discover the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of God in your most <HI>unrighteous Desamations.</HI> Upon the discovery, <HI>Repent</HI> of what has been amiss; abhor it; bewail it; weep to the Lord, that for the sake of that <HI>Blood,</HI> which <HI>clean∣ses from all Sin,</HI> you may have the Pardon of it. Oh! happy <HI>Reproaches</HI> which quicken us in the great work of <HI>Repentance!</HI> Be <HI>as meek as a Lamb,</HI> under the Injuries that are done you; let the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of God, shining therein, make you so. But fly to the <HI>Lamb of God:</HI> And verily when you have conversed with the <HI>Bleed of the Lamb,</HI> you will have <HI>white Robes</HI> upon you: <HI>White Robes,</HI> I say; You may desy <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> to be∣spatter them.</P>
<P>That which makes me the more to urge a great regard unto the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of God in your <HI>Defamations,</HI> is this; Even <HI>Persecu∣tions</HI> that come upon us for the <HI>Cause of</HI> GOD, yet oftentimes carry <HI>Castigations</HI> in them. Rarely do there come any violent <HI>Per∣secutions</HI> on the Churches of the Lord, until they have by their <HI>Formality,</HI> and <HI>Contention,</HI> and <HI>abounding Iniquity,</HI> ripened themselves for such Calamities. Old <HI>Cyprian</HI> will tell you so. The <HI>French Resugees</HI> at this day,
<PB N="8" REF="002143_0024_0FBC22DCDD87B910"/>may tell you so. And yet <HI>Persecutions</HI> do at last prove <HI>Priviledges</HI> to the People of God. Thus particular Servants of the Lord may be <HI>Persecuted,</HI> because Heaven has a Fa∣vour for them; they may be the <HI>Favourites</HI> of Heaven. Yet, Oh the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of our God! The <HI>sorrows</HI> brought on them in their <HI>Per∣secutions,</HI> may be also to bring them unto <HI>Repentance</HI> for some <HI>Errors</HI> which they have been guilty of. The most excellent, but <HI>Reproached</HI> Confessors of Christ, bearing the <HI>Reproach of Christ,</HI> may yet also bear, at the very same time, a <HI>Rebuke for Sin.</HI> When the admirable <HI>Paul</HI> underwent <HI>stoning,</HI> he was honoured in it; adorned by it; vastly enriched; every <HI>Stone</HI> thrown at him was, to him as good as a <HI>Pearl.</HI> Some think, that while he lay in a <HI>Swoon</HI> under those Outrages of his Enemies; <HI>Now</HI> was the time that he was <HI>caught up,</HI> and had one of his Raptures, either that into <HI>Paradise,</HI> or that into the <HI>Third Heaven.</HI> Yet, no doubt, this Martyr of the Lord, when he came to himself, soon made this reflection; <HI>Lord, When the Blood of thy Martyr</HI> Stephen <HI>was shed, I was also standing by.</HI> The share he had in <HI>stoning</HI> the Martyr <HI>Stephen,</HI> was now to be again <HI>repented</HI> of. And so was the <HI>Burning</HI> of the Martyr <HI>Lambart,</HI> when that good Man the Martyr <HI>Cranmer</HI> was going into the Fire. <HI>Consider what I say, and the
<PB N="9" REF="002143_0025_0FBC22DE5F8E00C0"/>Lord give you Understanding.</HI> For I may now put you in mind, that by being brought thus to see the <HI>Divine Righteousness,</HI> you will come to a most Experimental sight of the <HI>Divine Faithfulness</HI> in what has befallen you. One that had been very much <HI>Defa∣med,</HI> could say, Gen. 50.20. <HI>God meant it un∣to good.</HI> If you get so much good by your <HI>Desamations,</HI> as to discern the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of God in them, and obtain, what is <HI>Ill</HI> in you, to be <HI>forgiven</HI> and <HI>amended,</HI> it is plain, <HI>God has meant it unto good.</HI> You may go on with Praises, with Wonders, and say, <HI>Lord, In Faithfulness thou hast afflicted me!</HI> It will most certainly be so, if you now set your selves to improve in <HI>Piety,</HI> by means of the <HI>Defamations,</HI> which are by the Impi∣ous hurled at you. O Man of God, You may be awakened unto the <HI>doing</HI> of much <HI>good,</HI> by being <HI>evil spoken of.</HI> We say very truly, <HI>Malice is a good Insormer, tho' it be a had Judge.</HI> You may by <HI>malicious Desama∣tions</HI> be <HI>Informed</HI> of those Points in your Conduct, which may need a better guard upon them. You may be being <HI>Reproached,</HI> be advised of those things, which ought to be <HI>Reformed.</HI> It contributed mightily to the advancement of <HI>Temperance</HI> in the Bles∣sed <HI>Monica,</HI> that one reproachfully called her a <HI>Wine Bibber.</HI> It would be wisely done of you, under <HI>Defamations,</HI> to <HI>search and try
<PB N="10" REF="002143_0026_0FBC22E0DBCDA148"/>your ways.</HI> Particularly whether, tho' what your <HI>Enemies</HI> have said of you, be <HI>false,</HI> yet the holy Eyes of God have not seen in you some <HI>Fault akin</HI> to that which has been charg∣ed upon you. If you find it so, Oh! <HI>mourn</HI> for it, and <HI>turn</HI> to God. This is the <HI>Lan∣guage</HI> of Heaven, in the <HI>bad Language</HI> of the <HI>evil Tongue,</HI> in the <HI>Fire</HI> spit at you by a <HI>Tongue set on Fire by Hell.</HI> At least, you may find this, that you should grow more emi∣nent in those <HI>Graces,</HI> and in those <HI>Duties</HI> which are most contrary to the <HI>Charges</HI> of your Enemies upon you. They, 'tis true, <HI>abuse</HI> you, and yet at the same time they <HI>exhort</HI> you, they <HI>excite</HI> you. God by them calls upon you; <HI>My Child, You are not yet come to a due Eminency in those good things, which are just contrary, most contrary to the ill things, that are spoken of you. Oh! be quickened unto an eminency in all goodness, by the Evil spoken of you.</HI> A Great Man of <HI>Macedonia</HI> profes∣ed himself much obliged unto the Chief Men of <HI>Athens,</HI> That by their <HI>Abuses</HI> they taught him how to Speak and how to Live, better than he should have done without such Monitors. Perhaps you may have <HI>Ene∣mies,</HI> who being sensible that you have some <HI>Friends</HI> who think well of you, are so un∣easy at it, and so resolved upon rendering you unserviceable, that they will make ve∣nemous <HI>Insinuations</HI> of your being an <HI>Hypo∣crite,:</HI>

Why, <HI>the Sons of Zeruiah?</HI> He seems to intimate, You have more of your <HI>Mother</HI> than of your <HI>Father</HI> in you; you talk as if you were of the <HI>weaker Sex;</HI> if you had the Souls of <HI>Men</HI> in you, a few <HI>ill Words</HI> would not be such an intolerable grievance with you.</P>
<P>If you will hearken to me, you shall take <HI>little notice</HI> of the <HI>Affronts</HI> that are offered you: For the most part they are not worth your <HI>Notice.</HI> When the famous Doctor <HI>Sands</HI> was ignominiously carried on a lame Jade through the City of <HI>London,</HI> a base Woman in scorn threw a Stone at him, and hit him full on the Breast; he took no other <HI>notice</HI> of it, but only made this mild Answer, <HI>Wo∣man, I pray God forgive thee!</HI> This was <HI>notice</HI> enough. Commend me to the sweet spirited <HI>Melancthon. Osiander,</HI> an hot Man, had preached against <HI>Vitus Theodorus. Osiander</HI> made the Pulpit the Stage on which he acted and vented his disaffection to that Ser∣vant of God. <HI>What shall I now do,</HI> says <HI>Vitus Theodorus?</HI> I know what Passion would have done; Come up with him, and make the Pul∣pit a Cock-pit. No, says my dear <HI>Melancthon</HI> to him; <HI>I beg you for the love of God, &amp; I charge you, that you do not answer</HI> Osiander <HI>again: Hold your peace; go on in your Ministry; make as if you heard nothing.</HI> Anon <HI>Osiander</HI> found that he had lost himself among the
<PB N="19" REF="002143_0035_0FBC22F11D0D8FA0"/>People of God; and <HI>Vitus Theodorus</HI> was no loser by his Conduct. If it would not be too much of a <HI>Contradiction</HI> to the very De∣sign which I am upon; too much of an <HI>En∣couragement</HI> unto a Passion, the very least and first Ebullitions whereof I would have to be discountenanced; I would say, You cannot more certainly <HI>Revenge</HI> your selves upon your <HI>Defamers,</HI> than by a Resolution to take <HI>little Notice</HI> of them. You cannot more gratify them than by bestowing much <HI>notice</HI> upon their spiteful Folly, and being much discomposed at it. <HI>Hoc I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acus velit.</HI> Besure, it is for the most part a point of <HI>prudence</HI> to let the <HI>Tongue-Squibs</HI> go out of themselves. Do you <HI>forget them,</HI> and they will soon be <HI>forgotten</HI> by all the World; <HI>Irritation</HI> will do no good. <HI>Chrysippus</HI> being told that one <HI>privately</HI> reproached him, re∣ply'd, <HI>Say nothing; else he will go on to do it publickly too.</HI> But I throw aside this Consi∣deration, and in the room of it, I will bring in what the brave old Marquess of <HI>Argyle</HI> observed. <HI>Men would seem</HI> (says he) <HI>to be very Jealous of their Honour, when for Words spoken in prejudice or diminution of it, they commence Suits and Processes against the Spea∣kers of them; but there is nothing so below a generous Spirit, and which argues more weak∣ness of Mind, than that they connot contemn Words, that are vain and uttered in haste. I
<PB N="20" REF="002143_0036_0FBC22F2D89A3F90"/>can set my Approbation to this; that I never knew any Man that got Advantage by so doing:</HI> Thus that Noble Person. The Truth is, <HI>Omnis injuria est in sensu patientis.</HI> Let the <HI>Sun</HI> say nothing, but only <HI>shine on,</HI> when <HI>Owls</HI> or <HI>Snails</HI> complain of him. I still ad∣vise, take little notice of impertinent Sto∣ries; Be as a Great Man once among us, would often advise all wise Men to be, <HI>Tattle-Proof.</HI> Indeed Concience of the <HI>Ninth Com∣mandment,</HI> may oblige us to confute some sorts of Slanders with <HI>Vindications.</HI> When Religion is like to suffer by our Silence, or when many of our <HI>Godly Brethren,</HI> are in danger of taking up a false Character of us, if we be <HI>Silent;</HI> Then 'tis a time to <HI>speak.</HI> But for the most part we shall enjoy most <HI>Peace,</HI> by holding our <HI>Peace.</HI> Especially, if God has placed us in Circumstances of <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Service,</HI> that shall render our <HI>Esteem,</HI> as rough and strong as a <HI>File,</HI> to every little whiffling thing that shall go to grate upon it. 'Tis a <HI>Thread-bare</HI> saying, but never to be <HI>worn out;</HI> always of use to wise Men when <HI>others</HI> go to <HI>pick Holes in their Coats; Mag∣num Contumeliae Remedium Negligentia:</HI> The best way to <HI>Conquer</HI> many <HI>Contumelies,</HI> is to <HI>Contemn</HI> them. The best way to <HI>silence</HI> ma∣ny <HI>Contumelious</HI> People, is to <HI>despise</HI> them. It is a <HI>Maxim of Wisdom;</HI> Prov. 12.19. <HI>A lying Tongue is but for a Moment. Lyes</HI> are
<PB N="21" REF="002143_0037_0FBC22F5ACE99EA0"/>usually <HI>short liv'd</HI> things. Do you by your <HI>Piety,</HI> and <HI>Innocence,</HI> and <HI>Usefulness,</HI> take a∣way what must be necessary to support the <HI>credit</HI> of the <HI>Lyes,</HI> with all <HI>reasonable Men;</HI> and for the most part, you need not concern your self; the <HI>Lyes</HI> will be <HI>but for a mo∣ment;</HI> they will <HI>dye away of themselves;</HI> the only way to keep them <HI>alive,</HI> will be for you to keep up the <HI>Talk</HI> of them with Labo∣rious, Troublesome, Noisy <HI>Vindications.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> have a Proverb, <HI>Lyes have their Feet cut off;</HI> they can't stand long. To use the Anci∣ent Phrase, <HI>Tempus mendacio Lupus,</HI> a little <HI>Time</HI> will be <HI>Wolf</HI> enough to devour it. My Friend, All would have been dead long ago, if you had not unadvisedly commenced a <HI>Law-Suit</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>I will here take the Liberty to Transcribe another Passage which I have somewhere met withal.</P>
<P><Q>If I hear that any Person has done me If <HI>rong,</HI> in Word or Deed, I find, it is <HI>often</HI> (perhaps not <HI>always</HI>) the best way in the World, <HI>not to let them know that I have a∣ny knowledge of it.</HI> The best way is to <HI>for∣give</HI> and <HI>forget</HI> the Wrong, and bury it in <HI>silence.</HI> For besides the Consideration due to the <HI>internal Advantage,</HI> reap'd by such Christianity, there is this to be Consider'd; Such is the <HI>malignity</HI> in the most of Men, that they will <HI>hate</HI> you, only because you
<PB N="22" REF="002143_0038_0FBC22F7EC9888D0"/><HI>know</HI> they have <HI>wronged</HI> you. They will as far as they can, <HI>justify</HI> the <HI>Wrong</HI> they have done; and because their wicked Hearts imagine, that you must needs bear a <HI>Spite</HI> unto them, for the <HI>wrong</HI> you have receiv∣ed from them, they will bear a <HI>confirmed Spite</HI> unto you on that vile account. Whereas I have often found, that my <HI>con∣cocting</HI> with Patience and Silence, a <HI>slight</HI> or an <HI>hurt</HI> that has been offered me, has been <HI>followed</HI> (&amp; <HI>rewarded</HI> by God,) with this Consequence; that the <HI>very Persons</HI> who have <HI>wronged</HI> me, have afterwards been made Instruments of <HI>singular Service</HI> to me.</Q></P>
<P>I meet with a notable Passage among the <HI>Axiomate Philosophiae Christianae,</HI> written by <HI>Christopher Besoldus</HI> above an Hundred Years ago; <HI>Axioms</HI> whereof every one is more va∣luable then an <HI>Ingot of Gold.</HI> Says he;
<Q>They who take an <HI>Antidote,</HI> won't swell upon the <HI>bite</HI> of a <HI>Viper,</HI> provided the <HI>Antidote</HI> be <HI>good.</HI> We pretend that we have taken <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Mansuetude</HI> for our <HI>Antidote;</HI> if when we are <HI>bitten</HI> by <HI>maledicent People,</HI> we <HI>swell,</HI> and are in a <HI>feverish rage</HI> upon it, our <HI>Antidote</HI> was not <HI>good. Signum id est Humilitatem nostram, &amp; Mansuetudinem esse fucatam.</HI></Q> If there were no other Ar∣gument for your <HI>long suffering,</HI> methinks the <HI>loss of Time</HI> that unavoidably attends
<PB N="23" REF="002143_0039_0FBC22F9A36F1350"/>our Prosecution of every <HI>Calumny,</HI> were e∣nough to afright us from it. You have but a <HI>little Time</HI> to live; you have lost a great deal of <HI>Time</HI> already: You have abundance of <HI>Work</HI> to do for God in your own Heart and Life, and Family; perhaps, you have work to do for the Churches of the Lord; the <HI>Devil</HI> would feign make this <HI>Work lie by;</HI> he throws <HI>Calumnies</HI> in your way, to di∣vert you from your <HI>Work.</HI> Instead of serving the Lord and his People in the most signifi∣cant Methods, your <HI>Time</HI> is to go this way: To <HI>fend</HI> and <HI>prove,</HI> and at last gain this weighty Point; <HI>Such a vain Man has said something he should not have said.</HI> A weighty Point! Certainly, <HI>Discretion shall preserve thee, Understanding shall keep thee</HI> from this Folly. You had better say to the most of <HI>Ca∣lumnies; I can't spare the Time for you:</HI> Say, <HI>I am doing a great Work; why should the Work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?</HI></P>
<P>And now, after all the pains I have taken to disswade you from <HI>speaking</HI> on this occa∣sion, I will prrswade you to <HI>speak;</HI> and this, unto the best Purpose imaginable. I must set before you the Heavenly Counsel &amp; Command of our Saviour, Math. 5.44. <HI>Pray for them which use you despitefully.</HI> You must give me leave to press this with a very great importunity upon you; that whenever you understand that any Person has <HI>injuriously defamed</HI> you,
<PB N="24" REF="002143_0040_0FBC22FAE5F72590"/>and <HI>abused</HI> you, you make this very thing an <HI>occasion</HI> for you, to <HI>pray</HI> for that Person; <HI>Pray</HI> for him now by <HI>Name,</HI> if you never did so before; before you go to rest that Night, mention the very <HI>Name</HI> of that Person before the Lord, and <HI>let this Prayer be made without Lips of Deceit: Lord! Pardon that Person, and Bless him, and make him wise and good, and do him good!</HI> Be not able to rest until you have done so. When you have done <HI>this,</HI> Oh! the Peace, Oh! the Joy, which may now fill your Mind, in the <HI>assurance</HI> of your own <HI>Pardon</HI> from the Lord! The <HI>comforting Spirit</HI> of God, in the <HI>Grace</HI> now exercised by you, <HI>seals</HI> your <HI>Pardon.</HI> Receive his <HI>Testimony, Child be of good cheer, Thy Sins are forgiven thee!</HI> A blessing worth a Thousand Worlds: I am importunate with you to <HI>assure</HI> it in this <HI>excellent way.</HI></P>
<P>Upon such a Text as that; Psal. 92.11. <HI>Mine Eye shall see my Desire on my Enemies; mine Ears shall hear my Desire of the Wicked that rise up against me:</HI> I have heard one say, It gave some shock to his Thoughts; it com∣pell'd him to behold none but the great <HI>Mes∣siah</HI> speaking: When it came to be sung in the Assemblies of <HI>Zion,</HI> the Thoughts con∣stantly awakened in him were, <HI>Lord, My Desire is, that my Enemies may be pardoned, and come to have a share with me in the Bles∣sings of Goodness.</HI> This truly were to <HI>sing
<PB N="25" REF="002143_0041_0FBC22FC5EC67AA0"/>with melody in the Heart unto the Lord.</HI> Here∣upon I consulred the Original: I found, that this Word, <HI>my Desire,</HI> is not in the Origi∣nal: I wished that some other <HI>Word of sup∣ply</HI> might be brought into the Translation, instead of <HI>my Desire:</HI> Why may we not Read, <HI>What God shall do,</HI> or, <HI>what shall be done?</HI> Ac∣cordingly, <HI>Darby,</HI> in his version of Psalms, when that Clause comes, Psal. 54.7. <HI>Mine Eye hath seen its Desire on my Enemies;</HI> turns it so, <HI>Thou mak'st my Focs to fall before mine Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>One says very truly, <HI>'Tis an easy thing to forgive Injuries, when God has changed the Pro∣perties of them, and turn'd them into Blessings.</HI> I hope, you have got so much good by your <HI>Defamations,</HI> that you can <HI>bless God</HI> for them; then it will be no hard thing for you to wish a <HI>Blessing</HI> on the Author of them.</P>
<P>Nor shall your <HI>Generosity</HI> stop here. It is a part of the <HI>gracious Yoke</HI> which our Sa∣viour has laid upon us; Math. 5.44. <HI>Do good unto them that hate you.</HI> I think you should <HI>watch</HI> the next opportunity after an Injury, and particularly after an injurious <HI>Defamation,</HI> to do some kindness unto the Person that has Injured you; <HI>Do something wherein he may be the better for you.</HI> It was an ancient Maxim <HI>Disce diligere Inimicum, si∣vis cavere Inimicum.</HI> Sir, <HI>Love</HI> your <HI>Enemies,</HI> and you will bravely <HI>arm</HI> your self against
<PB N="26" REF="002143_0042_0FBC22FE19596910"/>your <HI>enemies.</HI> Never decline any <HI>Justice</HI> or <HI>Service,</HI> which may lye in your way to do for such a Person, because he has <HI>Defamed</HI> you; but let his ill-doings <HI>provoke</HI> you to <HI>Love and good Works; provoke</HI> you to invent some way of being <HI>useful</HI> to him, which else you had never thought upon. Your <HI>Discre∣tion</HI> may so manage the Circumstances of your Action, that the Man shall not be <HI>hard∣ned in Sin</HI> by what you do. It may be so managed, that you may find the sweet ac∣complishment of that Word, Rom. 12.20. <HI>If thine Enemy hunger, feed him; if be thirst give him Drink: For in so doing thou shalt heap Coals of Fire on his head.</HI> That is to say; thou shall <HI>melt</HI> him; effectually and throughly <HI>melt</HI> him. The Expression may seem to carry some <HI>Damage</HI> in it, but the <HI>Allu∣sion</HI> has not been commonly understood; it al∣ludes unto them who are concerned with the <HI>melting</HI> of <HI>Metals;</HI> the <HI>Metals</HI> which will not be <HI>melted</HI> by <HI>Fire</HI> put under them, are <HI>melted</HI> when <HI>Coals of Fire</HI> are <HI>beaped</HI> upon them; are laid over the <HI>Crucible.</HI> It may be by such a <HI>good Conduct</HI> of yours, you may <HI>overcome Evil with Good.</HI> You may bring your Adversaries to such a <HI>Renorse,</HI> that they shall bear this glorious Testimony for you; <HI>He is a good Man.</HI> Whether this be done or no, it is most certain you will, by such a <HI>Conduct</HI> exceedingly <HI>glorisy God:</HI> Your
<PB N="27" REF="002143_0043_0FBC22FF5E23E1A0"/>concern for such a <HI>Conduct,</HI> will exceedingly discover the <HI>Love of God</HI> flaming in your Soul: The Consolations of that <HI>Love</HI> will be wonderful! be wonderful!</P>
<P>I will now observe to you this one thing more. There are none that have so much occasion to endeavour a <HI>good carriage</HI> under <HI>Desamations,</HI> as a faithful MINISTER of the Gospel. Upon that Clause in the Fifth Pe∣tition of the <HI>Lord's Prayer, Forgive us, as we Forgive;</HI> says <HI>Luther, Mirabilis esthaec additio!</HI> The like Appendix might have been added unto the other Petitions; as before this, <HI>Give us this Day our daily Bread, as we dispense daily Bread unto those who are about us;</HI> and after this, <HI>Lead us not into Temptation, as we are loth to lead others into Temptation.</HI> Indeed we should look upon our selves as being so ob∣liged. But then our Saviour intimates unto us; that on our <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Forgiveness</HI> to∣wards our Neighbour, will depend all the other good Operations which are thus to be pursued. It is a World full of such Offen∣ces, that except we can <HI>forgive,</HI> we shall do very little <HI>good</HI> unto our Neighbours. But it is a Remark, as I remember, of a <HI>French</HI> Writer, that in this <HI>Platform of Prayer,</HI> the condition of a <HI>Minister</HI> is peculiarly accom∣modated. I will not go thro' all the Parti∣culars; 'tis enough to Note, The ungodly part of Mankind will multiply <HI>Injuries</HI> upon
<PB N="28" REF="002143_0044_0FBC230373B6A9A8"/>every <HI>Faithful Minister.</HI> His fulfilment of his Ministry, will expose him to the Envy and Malice of many People, and a Thousand Injuries. For such in a peculiar manner, is this Petition calculated; <HI>Forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors.</HI></P>
<P>It was the happy <HI>Rule</HI> of a <HI>Minister</HI> which I have somewhere found recited in these Terms.</P>
<P><Q>It is a <HI>Rule</HI> with me, rather to suffer and bury in silence, any manner of Inju∣ries and Abuses from <HI>absurd People</HI> in the Flock, than to manage any <HI>Contention</HI> with them, on any <HI>Occasion.</HI> Let the <HI>Matter</HI> or <HI>Issue</HI> be what it will, I shall generally gain more in regard of the Great Interest, by Remitting of my Right, than by <HI>pursuing</HI> of it.</Q></P>
<P>A <HI>Minister,</HI> above all other Men, should soar to <HI>Heaven,</HI> live in <HI>Heaven,</HI> keep near <HI>Heaven;</HI> and if he will do so, I tell you, what will be his Experience.</P>
<P>The Incomparable <HI>Newton</HI> has demon∣strated, That the <HI>weight</HI> of <HI>Bodies,</HI> or the force of their <HI>descent</HI> towards the <HI>Center,</HI> decreases, as their <HI>distance</HI> from the <HI>Center</HI> increases. A <HI>Ton</HI> weight on the surface of the Earth raised Heaven-wards unto the heighth of one semi-diameter of the Earth, from hence, would weigh but one Quarter of a <HI>Ton.</HI> At three semi-diameters from the
<PB N="29" REF="002143_0045_0FBC23049C8963B0"/>surface of the Earth, it would be as easy for a Man to carry a <HI>Ton,</HI> as here to carry little more than an Hundred Pounds. I know, the further you fly towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> the more (if I may use the <HI>Faulconers</HI> Word) you must <HI>Lesson.</HI> There is great Reason why it should be so! <HI>Desamations</HI> will be some of the things by which you must be <HI>lessen'd.</HI> It's true, <HI>Defamations</HI> are <HI>heavy</HI> Things, they are hard to carry; it is hard to carry well under them; some of them are a <HI>Ton</HI> weight. But my Friend, If you were as near <HI>Heaven</HI> as you ought to be, you would make <HI>light</HI> of them; you would bear them wonderfully.</P>
<P N="3">III. It may be some relief of your <HI>Disquiet∣ments</HI> under your <HI>Defamations,</HI> to consider what <HI>Company</HI> you have in your Affliction; to consider, how <HI>defamed</HI> and <HI>ill spoken of,</HI> the <HI>best of Men</HI> in the World have been before you. What you undergo has much <HI>Temptation</HI> in it; But Sir, no <HI>Temptation except what is common</HI> to the best of Men. <HI>This comfort for the miserable,</HI> seems to be recommended as no <HI>miserable comfort</HI> by our Saviour; Math. 5.11, 12. <HI>Blessed are you when Men shall Re∣vile you, and Persecute you, and shall say all manner of Evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for so per∣secuted they the Prophets which were before you.</HI> Well known is the Story of that <HI>Knight,</HI> who going to his Martyrdom, and seeing
<PB N="30" REF="002143_0046_0FBC23061E547EF0"/>himself, because of his Quality, excused from the <HI>Chain</HI> worn by the other Martyrs, he cry'd out, <HI>I Pray let me be a Knight of that Order;</HI> and ask'd that he might wear a <HI>Chain</HI> as well as they! There never was an useful Servant of God in the World without so many <HI>Defamations;</HI> that if you should be wholly without them, and <HI>all Men should speak well of you,</HI> you might well question, <HI>whether you are a Saint of their Order or no.</HI> The <HI>Enmity</HI> fixed at the beginning between the <HI>two Seeds,</HI> has ever since been operating in Defamations: The <HI>Third Chapter of Gene∣sis</HI> has predicted them; for all that will re∣nounce and oppose the Kingdom of <HI>Satan</HI> in the World; and such is the Influence of <HI>Satan,</HI> on the <HI>Tongues</HI> of his Children, that he continually procures the Prediction to be accomplished. <HI>Moses,</HI> the Writer of this, was a famous Instance of it; <HI>Moses,</HI> the greatest Man, [Let the Insolent <HI>Critick</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> say what he will!] that ever shone in the World for four Thousand Years together; An <HI>Angel in Flesh.</HI> How often did his own People <HI>Defame</HI> him in their <HI>Murmurings:</HI> The People that were under more Obligations unto <HI>Him,</HI> than unto any Man under Heaven! So impertinent, as to make a Story, that there was an <HI>Arabian Woman,</HI> unto whom he had hearkened more than he should have done. The Pagans did
<PB N="31" REF="002143_0047_0FBC2307A26BE3C0"/>their part also in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of him. He had once a <HI>Leprosy</HI> on his Hand most miraculously, most honourably circumstanced; the Ancient Historians hereupon spread a Story, that he was a <HI>Leper,</HI> and for this cause driven with his People out of <HI>Egypt.</HI> Yea, which is un∣accountable: The Accounts which the wicked <HI>Jews</HI> themselves, in their <HI>Talmuds,</HI> give both of <HI>Moses</HI> and of <HI>David,</HI> would render them the most <HI>scandalous</HI> Men that ever were in the World.</P>
<P><HI>The Time would fail me, to mention</HI> all the <HI>holy Prophets,</HI> who have joined in the Com∣plaint made by one of them; Jer. 20.10. <HI>I heard the Desaming of many.</HI> They have been <HI>Defamed</HI> as the <HI>Troublers of Israel,</HI> when they were the <HI>Chariots of Israel.</HI> They were <HI>Deserted</HI> and <HI>Defamed,</HI> until they have re∣tired unto the <HI>funiper-Tree.</HI></P>
<P>Under the <HI>New Testament;</HI> the matter has not been mended; the <HI>old Enmity</HI> has been carried on in the <HI>old way, which wicked Men have Trodden.</HI> The <HI>Apostles</HI> of our Sa∣viour, could appeal to all that knew them; <HI>Ye are Witnesses, how Holily, how Righteously, how Unblameably we have behaved our selves.</HI> But then, those Men of God were called unto this <HI>marvellous Proof</HI> of their being so. 2 Cor. 5.4, 8. <HI>Approving our selves as the Ministers of God, in much Patience, by Disho∣nour — by Evil Report.</HI> Above all, thou
<PB N="32" REF="002143_0048_0FBC23099A32C598"/>must not be forgotten, O <HI>Paul,</HI> who didst <HI>labour,</HI> (and in this way, <HI>suffer) more abun∣dantly then they all.</HI> Nor thy <HI>Thorn in the Flesh,</HI> — the strange Aversion which the <HI>Christianized Jews</HI> had unto him, on the score of his labour among the <HI>Gentiles:</HI> A Reproachful Aversion which could not be removed. The Gracious God, tho' <HI>besought thrice</HI> by his Prayerful and Faithful Servant, yet would not remove this <HI>Buffeting</HI> Incum∣brance, but have him content with the <HI>Fa∣vour</HI> which he had in other things bestow'd upon him. In the early Times, the <HI>Primi∣tive</HI> Christians, how <HI>defamed</HI> were they? Such vile <HI>Accusations</HI> were brought unto the <HI>Imperial Throne</HI> against them, that some of the best Emperors look'd on them as the worst of People; a <HI>Trajan</HI> himself became their Persecutor. The Church was long <HI>with Child,</HI> and in <HI>Travel,</HI> (full Two Hundred and Eigh∣ty Eight prophetical Days;) before the Re∣volution, when the <HI>Accuser of the Brethren,</HI> could be no more heard against her; yea, and after that <HI>Constantinian Revolution,</HI> it was astonishing to see, how professed <HI>Chris∣tians,</HI> but shamefully <HI>divided</HI> ones, persecu∣ted one another with <HI>Defamations:</HI> Especi∣ally the <HI>Arians</HI> against the <HI>Orthodox.</HI> The one Example of <HI>Athanasius</HI> may be enough; you may <HI>learn all</HI> from what was done to that <HI>one. Church History</HI> reports, that <HI>Caedes,
<PB N="33" REF="002143_0049_0FBC230A9B45F2E8"/>Adulteria, Furta, quicquid atrox confingi po∣terat, sancto viro objiciebantur.</HI> They accused him for <HI>Beating</HI> some other Ministers, and offering them horrid Outrages; and for <HI>Spoiling</HI> and <HI>Robbing</HI> of Churches. The <HI>A∣rians</HI> Compelled him to do some necessary Things for his own Defence, and then those <HI>unreasonable Men,</HI> complained of him for doing those Things. They accused him for <HI>Murdering</HI> a Man, and cutting off one of his Hands to serve certain magical Pur∣poses: tho' the Man anon appear'd alive, safe and sound, unto the confusion of the Accusers. They accused him of a Crimi∣nal <HI>Conversation with Women;</HI> tho' the Ac∣cusers were anon confounded by their Con∣fessions which the Wretches made, that they never saw any thing amiss by him, Sometimes their Accusations prevailed so far as to compel his retirement out of the Town. The <HI>chief Rulers</HI> were violently set against him. The corrupt <HI>Clergy</HI> hated him, and would have had him utterly Deposed. The Glorious CHRIST, whose Cause he Espoused, strangely Supported him, and Pre∣served him; Once by singing of <HI>Psalms,</HI> he so charmed the Soldiers who came to sieze him, they could not meddle with him. He had many <HI>Triumphs</HI> over his Adversaries: He often saw them reduced unto such Con∣fusion that they were afraid, they were asha∣med
<PB N="34" REF="002143_0050_0FBC230DF1B12930"/>of owning themselves to be <HI>his Adver∣saries.</HI> At last, he dyed peaceably and ho∣nourably in his own City, after he had been a Bishop for six and Forty Years. I will trouble Antiquity to spare us one Example more, from the many which it might afford unto us. <HI>Narcissus</HI> the serviceable and ad∣mirable Minister of <HI>Jesusalem;</HI> a Man of such a shining sanctity, the <HI>sore Eyes</HI> of en∣vious Men were offended at the brightness of it. Three of them accused him of <HI>Un∣chastity,</HI> and swore to it with dreadful Im∣precations; one wished that he might be <HI>burnt</HI> if he had not spoke the Truth; the second wished, that he might <HI>Rot</HI> alive; the third wished, that he might lose his <HI>Eye sight.</HI> Very few believed the Accusati∣on; yet this humble and modest Servant of God withdrew upon it. But the Vengeance of God soon followed the <HI>Accusers;</HI> the House of the first unaccountably took <HI>Fire,</HI> and he with all his Family were <HI>burnt</HI> to Ashes; the second fell into a disease, in which he did <HI>Rot</HI> and <HI>Die;</HI> the third saw this and was terrified, and owned the wick∣ed Combinations, and with the very <HI>Tears</HI> of his Repentance he <HI>wept his Eyes out. Nar∣cissus</HI> then returned and became a brighter Saint then ever he had been in his Life before. I mention this, because the Authors of <HI>Defa∣mations</HI> ought to be afraid of the <HI>Judgments</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="002143_0051_0FBC230F1B91F3F0"/>wherewith God may vindicate his <HI>wronged Children,</HI> who bear patiently all the Wrongs that are done unto them, and <HI>commit them∣selves to him that Judges Righteously.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, those great Men, who illumina∣ted the <HI>Primitive Churches,</HI> met with strange <HI>Absurdities</HI> in the dealings of their <HI>Adver∣saries</HI> with them. Their <HI>Adversaries</HI> let them see, how ready they were to catch at any thing that might look <HI>defamatory</HI> upon them. <HI>Jerom</HI> for Instance, had written some very <HI>applauding</HI> things concerning <HI>Origen;</HI> yet afterwards he wrote other things great∣ly <HI>condemning</HI> of him. <HI>Ruffin</HI> for this, rais∣ed an horrid Clamour against <HI>Jerem,</HI> as be∣ing a Man of <HI>no Truth</HI> in him; yea, <HI>Austin</HI> himself censured <HI>Jerom</HI> for Levity and In∣constancy. It was a mistake in <HI>them; Je∣rom</HI> defended himself with this fair Apo∣logy: <HI>I commend the Man for his Accomplish∣ments; But I always disliked his Principles. I highly valued his Abilities; but I did not there∣by tye my self up from disliking what is to be found amiss in him.</HI> A Man may be Reproach∣ed as <HI>Inconstant</HI> when he observes the Rule of the truest <HI>Constancy.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>object,</HI> and not <HI>he</HI> that <HI>Changes.</HI></P>
<P>Let us come down to the Time of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> we shall not find this <HI>way of wickedness</HI> then <HI>reformed.</HI> Good Men were still defamed wonderfully. What hideous
<PB N="36" REF="002143_0052_0FBC2310D2E05620"/><HI>Defamations</HI> of the most excellent Men in the World, are the Writings of such Men as <HI>Tympius,</HI> and <HI>Cochleus,</HI> and <HI>Genebrard</HI> stuff'd withal? To such a degree of <HI>Defam∣ing</HI> did the sottish Malice and Madness of their Adversaries carry them, that they printed Stories about the <HI>tragical Deaths</HI> of these Excellent Men, while the Men were yet living: But forced, it seems, by <HI>writing and printing</HI> of Answers, to prove that they were indeed <HI>Alive.</HI></P>
<P>None suffer'd more this way then the fa∣mous <HI>Luther,</HI> whereupon our <HI>Whitaker</HI> made that Remark; <HI>Pelix ille, quem Dominus eo honore dignatus est, ut Homines nequissimos suos haberet Inimicos.</HI> There is a sort of <HI>wicked Men</HI> whom it will be your <HI>happiness</HI> to have your <HI>Enemies;</HI> you are <HI>honour'd</HI> if you may enjoy their <HI>Enmity.</HI> What <HI>smutty Stories</HI> did they invent and foment concern∣ing the admirable <HI>Beza?</HI> I will not menti∣on the rest of the <HI>notoriously defamed Hero's;</HI> but only the Great, the Sweet, the dear <HI>Calvin</HI> must not be left unmentioned. <HI>France</HI> never saw a better Man; and yet how odi∣ous the Name of <HI>Calvin?</HI> The Witlings of the time (a knot of them at <HI>Bruxells</HI> par∣ticularly) laid their Wits together to write Athestical <HI>Pamphlets</HI> of <HI>Modest Inquiries</HI> up∣on him. The Title was, <HI>Calvino-mastix.</HI> They made their <HI>Satyrs</HI> as pugnent as they
<PB N="37" REF="002143_0053_0FBC23122123CB90"/>could; they indroduced the inraged <HI>Prince</HI> of the Bottomless Pit, as threatning to Plague the World with the most pestilenti∣al <HI>Monster</HI> he could procure for the punish∣ment of Mankind. This <HI>cursed Monster</HI> must be <HI>Calvin!</HI> They charged him as being guil∣ty of the <HI>Villanies</HI> and <HI>Forgeries</HI> which pro∣duced (as they said) his being <HI>burnt on the Shoulder</HI> for a Rogue. They <HI>Stigmatized</HI> him for one that in treating certain <HI>possessed People,</HI> had scandalously misbehav'd himself. When he was dead, what a hideous Cha∣racter did <HI>Bolsecus</HI> publish of him, which passes among the Adversaries of the refor∣med Religion, for <HI>a true History of the Life and Death</HI> of <HI>Mr. Calvin?</HI> It accuses him, as being a <HI>Drunkard,</HI> an <HI>Epicure,</HI> a <HI>Whore-mas∣ter,</HI> the worst of Men; That he pretended unto certain <HI>Supernatural Powers</HI> of Heaven; but was detected in his deceit: That he dyed eaten up with Lice (the Word <HI>Phthi∣sis</HI> they extended into <HI>Phthiriasis</HI>) blasphem∣ing of God, invoking of Devils, detesting his Work of <HI>Reformation,</HI> and cursing the Day that ever he put Pen to Paper. Yea, and in the <HI>English</HI> Nation it self, how odi∣ous the Name of <HI>Calvin?</HI> Tho' the true Friends of the <HI>Reformation</HI> have generally concur'd with Dr. <HI>Hoyl,</HI> when he said:
<Q>That great Instrument of Gods Glory, <HI>John Calvin,</HI> was a Man of whom I had
<PB N="38" REF="002143_0054_0FBC23139EE5FD08"/>almost said, as once it was of <HI>Moses, That there arose not a Prophet since like him</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> nor since the Apostles Days <HI>was be∣fore him.</HI> His Works the World may ad∣mire how they could be so <HI>many,</HI> being so <HI>good,</HI> and so <HI>good</HI> being so <HI>many;</HI></Q> Yet you will find a venemous Dr. <HI>Heylin,</HI> (a Son of the Church, who usually discover'd a <HI>Soul</HI> as <HI>Black</HI> as the Ink he wrote withal;) dress him up in <HI>Sambenito's;</HI> and at the best make but a <HI>Reverend Scribler</HI> of him.</P>
<P>I am very much mistaken, if the most <HI>Re∣formed</HI> Country in the World have no Sons of <HI>Bolseus</HI> in it. I will no longer believe some <HI>Defamations</HI> which I see published in some of the most received <HI>English Histories.</HI> No, nor some that have been rashly taken up from Tory Reporters, and Publish'd in the life of our <HI>Baxter</HI> himself, concern∣ing such Persons as our <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and our <HI>O∣wen;</HI> Servants of God, as unworthy to be exposed for taking <HI>wrong Steps</HI> as the <HI>Histo∣rian.</HI> And that holy Man, the <HI>Historian</HI> whom I now mention, might remember that he was himself accused of a criminal Familiary with a lew'd Woman, yea, and with killing a Man in cold Blood; tho' he was really a Man of as much <HI>Grace &amp; Worth</HI> as most that ever the Nation had. I will tell you why I will not readily believe such Stories. I have known ill Men to spread
<PB N="39" REF="002143_0055_0FBC23151B583E80"/>Stories (like themselves) of certain <HI>Cheats</HI> and <HI>Frauds</HI> as used by some Servants of God in <HI>Religious</HI> Matters; when I have certainly known that the Stories have been Lies, and vile Fictions of ill-minded Men: And, I can chearfully say, <HI>The Great God knows the Truth of this Declaration;</HI> Yea, I have seen the Remarkable Judgments of God on the Authors of them. But such Men as <HI>Good∣win &amp; Owen</HI> had done so much to pull down the Kingdom of the <HI>Devil</HI> in the World, that the <HI>Devil</HI> must, by <HI>Defamations,</HI> take an <HI>exemplary revenge</HI> upon them. And some <HI>Good Men</HI> were so <HI>ill affected</HI> unto their most valuable <HI>Brethren,</HI> as to let themselves be therewith imposed on. And I will take leave to transcribe a Passage from the excel∣lent <HI>Owen</HI> on this occasion. <HI>A Man may have the Blessing of God and the Curse of a professing People at the same time. Man's Condemnation, and God's Absolution do not seldom meet upon the same Persons, for the same things. If you do the Will of the Lord, pray think it not strange, if among Men, Curses be your Reward, and Detestation your Wages.</HI> I mention this Observation by the by, because you may live to have occasion for it.</P>
<P>The Glorious God has in this way, exer∣cised his most faithful Servants. It has been <HI>to humble them, and prove them, and do them good in the latter end:</HI> Of such <HI>Defa∣mations</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="002143_0056_0FBC2318B6801A48"/>I may say as <HI>Jerom</HI> concerning other Calamities:
<Q>They are <HI>Monitors</HI> put upon us, to <HI>Humble</HI> us, <HI>in similituainem Trium∣phantium,</HI> as when the Conquerors of old rode in <HI>Triumph,</HI> there was a Person placed behind them in the <HI>Triumphal Chariot,</HI> who as often as the Citizens made their <HI>Accla∣mations,</HI> whispered them in the Ear with an, <HI>Hominem te esse memento;</HI> Remember, Sir, you are but a Man.</Q> When the Ser∣vants of God have <HI>Triumphed</HI> with continual <HI>serviceableness,</HI> the Way of Heaven has been to clap <HI>Detracters</HI> upon them, from whom in the midst of the Acclamations which the obliged Churches of God have bestowed upon them, they have had the most wholesom <HI>Admonitions.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>Conformity</HI> to the ever blessed JESUS, whereto His <HI>Defamed</HI> Servants, <HI>do</HI> and <HI>may</HI> arrive, should be much in their Eye, under their <HI>Defamations.</HI> Looking after an Adequate notion of <HI>Honour,</HI> I finally deter∣mined upon this; All true <HI>Honour</HI> lies in a <HI>Conformity</HI> to the admirable JESUS. Where∣in a Man is <HI>Conformable</HI> to the admirable Saviour of the World, so far, and no farther he is an <HI>Honourable</HI> Man. Thence I infer, to be <HI>Defamed,</HI> may be to be <HI>Honoured:</HI> For I am sure the Saviour of Men was extremely <HI>Defamed</HI> among Men; <HI>Despised &amp; rejected of Men.</HI> It was foretold of him that he
<PB N="41" REF="002143_0057_0FBC231A0342F218"/>should be <HI>spoken against:</HI> And it was fulfil∣led unto extremity; there was not a Person in all the Land so <HI>spoken against.</HI> Indeed he had <HI>some</HI> that stood by him, yet they were but <HI>some;</HI> We read, Joh. 7.12. <HI>Some said, He is a Good Man: Others said, no, but he de∣ceiveth the People.</HI> In the Visions which the beloved <HI>John</HI> had of our Saviour, we see, Rev. 1.15. <HI>His feet like unto fine Brass, as if they burned in a Furnace.</HI> The Learned <HI>Grellot</HI> has a curious Thought upon it. Our Saviour passed through a <HI>burning Furnace</HI> of Afflictions, that so he might come to His <HI>Glory.</HI> Grievous <HI>Defamations</HI> were some of the <HI>scorches,</HI> that afflicted Him in that <HI>Fiery Furnace,</HI> and compelled him to cry out, Psal. 69.19, 20. <HI>Thou hast known my Reproach, and my Shame &amp; my Dishonour: Mine Ad∣versaries are all before thee; Reproach hath broken my Heart.</HI> He took a <HI>Friendly notice</HI> of some that had not the best of Reputation; but with no other intention than the chari∣table one of a <HI>Physitian,</HI> intending to recover his <HI>Patients.</HI> For this he was <HI>Defamed,</HI> as a <HI>Familiar Friend of Wicked People.</HI> He Com∣passionately provided a large quantity of <HI>Wine</HI> for the Neighbours at a Wedding-Feast: For this he was <HI>Defamed,</HI> as a <HI>Wine-Bibber.</HI> He did wonderful things to deliver poor People from the Hands and Hurts of <HI>Evil Spirits:</HI> He was requited with being <HI>Defamed</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="002143_0058_0FBC231B29DEEAF8"/>as one that carried on an unlawful Converse with <HI>Evil Spirits. No man heard his voice in the Streets:</HI> He fled from all the very Whis∣pers of a <HI>Temporal Kingdom;</HI> yet he was <HI>Defamed</HI> as one that <HI>moved Sedition.</HI> A <HI>Thief</HI> was prefer'd before him. His own <HI>Kindred</HI> had those among them, who maltreated Him; and call'd Him all that was bad. I find by Travellers, the Jews to this Day make this their great offence against Him. <HI>He went about doing of Good;</HI> yet a great part of Mankind conspired for to treat him as an <HI>Evil Doer.</HI> Tho' He could challenge all Men living to tax him with the least <HI>Ill thing,</HI> yet He was <HI>Numbred with Transgressors;</HI> He was Crucified between <HI>Two Robbers:</HI> From whence <HI>Hierocles,</HI> almost Three Hundred Years after, published and fomented a Tradition, that he was a <HI>Highway-Man,</HI> the Head of a des∣perate Crew of <HI>Banditti.</HI> Thus a <HI>Generation of Vipers,</HI> the most remarkable Set of the <HI>Seed of the Serpent</HI> that had been in any Ge∣neration, stung the <HI>Holy, Harmless, Undefiled</HI> JESUS! O Disciple; How, how canst thou propose any other sort of treatment, than what thy Glorious Lord met withal?</P>
<P>There never can be better Advice given to a <HI>Defamed</HI> Christian than that, Heb. 12.2, 3. <HI>Look unto JESUS, who for the Joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right Hand of the
<PB N="43" REF="002143_0059_0FBC231CA7738C60"/>Throne of God; consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself, least ye be wearied and faint in your Minds.</HI> Accord∣ingly in the <HI>Defamations</HI> that you suffer, you may very allowably examine, <HI>What conformity to the Sufferings of the Lord JESUS CHRIST may be discovered.</HI> Indeed we must with all the Contrition &amp; Confusion imagina∣ble, make the Acknowledgment of the pe∣nitent Sinner, who was <HI>Crucified</HI> with our Saviour; <HI>We suffer justly: We receive the due Reward of our Deeds. Our Lord never did any thing amiss.</HI> But this does not forbid us poor Sinners, to consider what there was in the Sorrows of our Saviour, to which any thing in our <HI>Sorrows</HI> may be <HI>conformable.</HI> It is an observable Passage, in Col. 1.24. <HI>I re∣joyce in my sufferings, and fill up the signatures of the Afflictions of Christ.</HI> The Greek word used there properly signifies the hollow Marks and Strokes of the <HI>Seal,</HI> which are filled up with <HI>Wax.</HI> In your <HI>Defamations</HI> you may without <HI>Immodesty,</HI> (but Oh! do it with a very <HI>trembling Modesty!</HI>) observe perhaps, the <HI>Signatures</HI> which may as the <HI>Wax</HI> under the <HI>Seal,</HI> answer something that befell CHRIST in his <HI>Afflictions.</HI> A brave Man once undergoing very batharous Indig∣nities as well as the loss or his Life on the Scaffold, chearfully said upon it; <HI>What a deal of do here is, to make a poor Sinner like
<PB N="44" REF="002143_0060_0FBC231E53354068"/>his Blessed Saviour?</HI> I make the more bold with this Matter, because Antiquity has told me, <HI>Contumelia sunt Christi insignia.</HI> This may be the glory of <HI>Defamations</HI> and <HI>Indignities.</HI> If you find yours to have any of this <HI>glory</HI> in them, Oh! count it a <HI>glory,</HI> and <HI>rejoyce</HI> in it, with <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>The great thing that remains, is your <HI>I∣mitation</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST under all the provoking <HI>Defamations</HI> that are heap'd up∣on you. Of him you read, 1 Pet. 2.21, 23. <HI>He has left us an Example that ye should fol∣low his steps; who when he was reviled, revil∣ed not again; when be suffer'd, he threatned not, but committed himself to him-that judges righteously.</HI></P>
<P>Are you in the Hands of the <HI>Shearers?</HI> Oh! that you could imitate that <HI>Lamb of God!</HI> His incomparable <HI>Meekness,</HI> and <HI>Pati∣ence,</HI> and <HI>Silence!</HI> His readiness to <HI>Forgive</HI> his most unreasonable Adversaries! When all manner of Evil was not only <HI>spoke</HI> of him, but also <HI>done</HI> to him, he expressed no undue Resentments; he did not let fall one outra∣gious or intemperate <HI>Word;</HI> he silently con∣cocted the <HI>Wrongs</HI> that were done unto him; he left to his Eternal Father, the <HI>Way</HI> and the <HI>Time</HI> of his just Vindication; He <HI>pray'd</HI> for his Persecutors; His obliging Prayer for them was, <HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="002143_0061_0FBC231FBA996760"/>
If you <HI>follow the steps</HI> of your suffering Sa∣viour, I will set before you the <HI>Consolations of God,</HI> which Oh! how can they be <HI>small</HI> unto you? There will infallibly belong to you those Great <HI>Consolations</HI> of God: 2 Tim. 2.12. <HI>If we suffer we shall also Reign with him.</HI> The <HI>Scars</HI> which your <HI>Defamations</HI> and o∣ther <HI>Calamities</HI> leave upon you, will be the <HI>Marks of the Lord Jesus</HI> born upon you: The <HI>Marks,</HI> which as often as you look up∣on, you may with a Triumphant Faith con∣clude; <HI>My Glorious LORD intends a part in the Glories of his heavenly Kingdom for me!</HI> My Friend, You will find the Joy of such Considerations to be inexpressible.</P>
<P>'Tis a Blessed thing to suffer <HI>like</HI> your Glorious LORD; but then if you suffer <HI>for</HI> him, or if the Cause of the malignity, which disposes ill Men readily to utter or to re∣ceive <HI>Defamations</HI> against you, be your known <HI>serviceableness</HI> to his Interests, and Churches, this is a vast addition to your Blessedness. Your <HI>Christ-like behaviour</HI> un∣der the Sufferings, will consummate the <HI>Tokens</HI> of a <HI>great Reward in Heaven</HI> reserved for you, and of your being one Day <HI>with him to behold his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir, is the <HI>consummating Point</HI> of your <HI>Conformity</HI> to your Saviour. <HI>First,</HI> You must be full of CHRIST: always <HI>thinking</HI> of him, acting for him; watching all occa∣sions
<PB N="46" REF="002143_0062_0FBC232310CDBA30"/>decently to make <HI>mention</HI> of his Glo∣ries; daily pleading of his <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> flying to his <HI>Righteousness;</HI> resigning to the Posses∣sion of his holy <HI>Spirit;</HI> admiring, studying, following, of his holy <HI>Pattern;</HI> perpetually rendring some <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> to him by your self, and bespeaking <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of him from others; this must be the very business of Your Life! <HI>Then,</HI> you must be as CHRIST was, full of <HI>Benevolence</HI> and <HI>Be∣neficence</HI> to Mankind; ever filled with <HI>Com∣passions</HI> towards the Miserable; ever doing to them all the <HI>Kindnesses</HI> imaginable: Par∣ticularly contributing to the <HI>Reconciliation</HI> of such as are at <HI>Variance;</HI> and seeking out <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>mean</HI> People, and with delight stooping to any kind Offices for them; and all this upon <HI>his account;</HI> continually <HI>con∣triving,</HI> how to be <HI>serviceable</HI> unto all that are about you; relishing of no Pleasure com∣parable to that of doing any <HI>Service</HI> where∣of you may be capable; thankful to any one that will but show you an Opportunity how to <HI>do Good,</HI> and not needing any Argu∣ments and Perswasives to lay hold upon it: Having imprinted on your Mind a deep apprehension of your being but a <HI>Steward</HI> of all your Possessions in this World; and in a discreet and faithful <HI>Stewardship,</HI> dispen∣sing all to just such uses as your Great Re∣deemer has prescribed for all.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="002143_0063_0FBC232481091B30"/>
When you have gained these two Points, you may be Tempted now to think, <HI>'Tis well; 'tis all!</HI> No, my Friend; it is not <HI>well,</HI> it is <HI>all</HI> spoilt, if there be not a <HI>Third</HI> super-added. It is this; If you thus glorify CHRIST, you must be greatly exposed unto the Envy and Hatred of a Malignant <HI>World;</HI> you must look to be as he was <HI>Despised and Rejected of Men. Satan</HI> Operating on the Minds of Men, will procure you a vast In∣cumbrance of <HI>Prejudice</HI> from the World. Men will have a strange Aversion for you: Yea, many that pass for <HI>Good Men</HI> will have so; and yet not be able to give any good Reason for their Aversion. Well, you must chearfully undergo all the <HI>Neglect,</HI> all the <HI>Contempt,</HI> all the <HI>Obloquies</HI> that shall be cast upon you. Your <HI>Love</HI> to a Glorious CHRIST, and your <HI>Hope</HI> of being <HI>lov'd</HI> by Him, and <HI>like</HI> to him, is to carry you chearfully through it all; yea, tho' you should be hat∣ed as the <HI>Off-scouring of all things.</HI> You must be willing that the <HI>Providence</HI> of God, and the <HI>Disesteem</HI> of Man, should make a very <HI>Nothing</HI> of you; and this not only from a Mind really, convinced that you are <HI>No∣thing,</HI> but also from the marvellous <HI>Exina∣nition</HI> of your glorious Christ, when he came into the World. Now, <HI>it is Finished!</HI></P>
<P>This is the Point of <HI>Conformity</HI> to your Blessed Saviour which I mightily press upon
<PB N="48" REF="002143_0064_0FBC23259F07A250"/>you; <HI>a Spirit Reconciled unto Humiliations;</HI> a <HI>Spirit</HI> that will not only <HI>submit</HI> to, but even <HI>delight</HI> in <HI>Humiliations;</HI> a Spirit not averse to <HI>Diminutions.</HI></P>
<P>And among the precious Discoveries of such a <HI>Spirit</HI> there is especially one, which you shall allow me to insist upon.</P>
<P>You know, that the beloved Apostle men∣tions <HI>Pride</HI> as the last part of the <HI>Old Man</HI> which dies within us. It's the <HI>Pride of Life;</HI> it Lives to the end of our <HI>Life;</HI> till we our selves do <HI>die.</HI> I have been inquisi∣tive, <HI>What is the last Essay of Pride?</HI> It is doubt∣less, for an <HI>humble</HI> Man to be willing to be <HI>thought humble;</HI> or, to be impatient, when <HI>Pride</HI> is charged upon him. This then is the Thing which I demand of you. Be al∣ways really, heartily, inwardly <HI>loathing your self;</HI> really esteem others <HI>Wiser</HI> and <HI>Better</HI> than your self; really shun <HI>Honours,</HI> be averse to them, afraid of them; never be uneasy at being <HI>over-looked</HI> by other Men; or if there be Three Hundred in <HI>Sparta</HI> Pre∣ferr'd before you. The very first <HI>Motions</HI> of a Design to make your self a <HI>Name,</HI> suppress them immediately. After all this, be not angry if you are still call'd a <HI>proud Man.</HI> It is the easiest thing imaginable for disaffected People to find something or other by which they will imagine to justify their passing such a <HI>Censure</HI> upon you. But
<PB N="49" REF="002143_0065_0FBC2327228A7FB0"/>now let not such a Censure produce the least <HI>impatience</HI> in you. I was not well sa∣tisfied with a very Good and Great Man, the Martyr <HI>Cyprian,</HI> for this thing; he had his Adversaries, whose principal Clamour against him was, that he was a <HI>Proud Man;</HI> he wanted <HI>Humility:</HI> Now the only Symptom of it that I know of was, that he took the pains to write a <HI>Letter,</HI> in his <HI>own Vindica∣tion</HI> against that foolish Calumny. His best Vindication, and the best Confutation of the Calumny, in my poor Opinion, would have been to have born it patiently, and have said <HI>nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P>I will mention to you one Circumstance of <HI>Conformity</HI> to your Blessed Saviour, which if it should occur in your Experience, I would not have you wonder at it. Our Saviour having had <HI>Heaven</HI> opened, with astonishing Testimonies of the Divine Fa∣vour to Him, at his <HI>Transfiguration</HI> in the Mount, he presently met with what was grievous to him; an <HI>horrid Spectacle</HI> of one possessed with a <HI>Devil,</HI> and something in the carriage of his own Disciples, which admi∣nistred Grief unto him. In Conformity to this, it has been the Observation made by some Servants of God, That just after they have been admitted unto a more than ordi∣nary <HI>Familiarity</HI> with Heaven, the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> presently entertains them with some
<PB N="50" REF="002143_0066_0FBC2328EFD8B7E0"/><HI>vexatious Object;</HI> something that proves very <HI>Troublesome</HI> and <HI>Abasing</HI> unto them; and most probably some <HI>Obloquy</HI> raised by the <HI>Devil</HI> against them! It may be, you have (especially on the whole <HI>Days</HI> which you have set apart for the <HI>Religion of the Closet</HI>) had an admission into <HI>Heaven,</HI> yea, into the <HI>most Holy Place</HI> of Heaven, by a lively Faith beholding JESUS in the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> concerned for you; you have been swallowed up with Raptures of <HI>Assurance,</HI> of what the Glorious One has done and will do for you. It has been with you a time of astonishing <HI>Irradiations</HI> from the Heavenly World! Now let it not surprize you, if you immediately have to do with People that have the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> in them. Oh! 'Tis an un-known Power that the <HI>Devil</HI> has over the Minds and the Tongues of <HI>Defamatory People!</HI> Nor let it be a surprize to you, if some from whom you might expect better things, be now left unto something that may grieve you wonderfully. <HI>Rejoyce, again I say, rejoyce,</HI> in this <HI>Conformity</HI> to your Saviour. <HI>Paul;</HI> If thou hast been in Heaven, expect a <HI>Messenger of Satan,</HI> (some <HI>Zedekiah</HI>) imme∣diately to <HI>Buffet</HI> thee.</P>
<P N="5">V. Let not your <HI>Defamations</HI> be the <HI>Discouragements</HI> of your <HI>Usefulness;</HI> by no means be discouraged from <HI>well-doing</HI> by being <HI>ill spoken</HI> of.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="002143_0067_0FBC232C478F8FE8"/>
Doubtless, one Design of Satan (the <HI>Prince of Defamers</HI>) in raising a storm of <HI>Defamations</HI> on you, is to overset your Disposition for the Service of God. But, Oh do not gra∣tify him! So, when the Prophet <HI>heard the defaming of many,</HI> he fell into that unhappy Pang, Jer. 20.9. <HI>Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his Name.</HI> I hope, Sir, you'l be better advised. If you had not been a <HI>Fruitful Tree,</HI> it may be, there had not been so many <HI>Stones</HI> and <HI>Sticks</HI> thrown at you. Now, my Friend, Bear not the fewer <HI>Good Fruits,</HI> because of what you have thus met withal. What a Tri∣umph was that? Rom. 8.37, 39. <HI>We are more than Conquerors,—DEPTH—shall not be able to separate us from the Love of God.</HI> Tho' you are brought into a <HI>Depth</HI> of Disgrace, and laid <HI>low</HI> by <HI>Defamation,</HI> yet, Oh! <HI>Love God,</HI> as much as ever, and <HI>Love</HI> the Service of God with a Flame that shall never be Extinguished. Let no <HI>Defa∣mations</HI> retund or flatten your brave <HI>Resolu∣tions,</HI> to do all the good that ever you can. <HI>Ignatius</HI> of old, said unto <HI>Polycary;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Stand steady like a beaten Anvil.</HI> Give me leave to address you with the like Advice. <HI>Bear</HI> all the Blows that are given you: And after all, <HI>Be</HI> what you were before; <HI>Be</HI> as firm in your Intentions and Endeavours to <HI>do Good</HI> as you were be∣fore.
<PB N="52" REF="002143_0068_0FBC232DD7544E28"/>Yea, <HI>Be</HI> much <HI>better</HI> than you were before; let nothing issue from you but bright <HI>Strictures</HI> of Piety and Patience, and <HI>sparkling</HI> Devotion and Usefulness. The Great God is by the <HI>Defamations</HI> which you are smitten withal, making a <HI>Tryal</HI> of your Sincerity and Fidelity; He is trying whe∣ther you will serve Him upon purer <HI>Princi∣ples</HI> than the <HI>Praise of Men.</HI> Oh! that you may be able to say, <HI>When I am Tryed, I shall come forth as Gold!</HI> It is a wonderful Speech of <HI>Plato, For the Tryal of true Virtue, 'tis necessary that a Good Man,</HI> [cum nihil injuste agat, famam sustineat maximae Injustitiae] <HI>should be Defamed as an Evil Doer, when he does all things well, justly and fairly; and that be should hold on immoveable under such Dis∣couragements.</HI></P>
<P>I will mention to you, Two very obser∣vable Experiments; things which I have often observed in the Course of my Pil∣grimage.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is a Passage which the Famous <HI>Baxter</HI> has in his <HI>Christian Directory: If you be famous for any Grace or Good Works, expect to be Defamed for the quite contrary; I have known some that have given away almost all they had to the Poor, and hardly kept Ne∣cessaries for themselves; yet these Persons have been accused of Covetousness, Unkind∣ness, Hard Dealing.</HI> 'Tis most certainly so.
<PB N="53" REF="002143_0069_0FBC232EA0A481A0"/><HI>Insani sapiens Nomen feret, AEquus Iniqui.</HI> If you decline a Thousand Opportunities to make your self a <HI>Name,</HI> and very patiently <HI>bear,</HI> and almost <HI>seek</HI> to be <HI>over-look'd,</HI> yet you shall be called, <HI>The proudest of Men.</HI> I you are always <HI>devising Liberal Things,</HI> and ever scorn <HI>little Things,</HI> yet you shall be Reproached as, <HI>a Man looking always for Gain</HI> If you contrive all the Methods imaginable not only to be Good, Loving, Tender in your several <HI>Relations,</HI> yet you shall be treated as a very <HI>unkind</HI> Person, and perhaps most <HI>unkindly</HI> by them that have the least Reason for it. Methought, I have often seen some resemblance of this Matter in a thing which I have seen befalling a <HI>Minister,</HI> when in the way of his Pastoral Duty, he visited Persons <HI>possessed with Evil Spirits;</HI> the Persons, tho' they knew every one else in the Room, yet thro' the unaccountable Operation of the <HI>Evil-Spirits</HI> on their Eyes, the Minister who was most likely to do them Good, still ap∣peared so dirty, so ugly, so <HI>disguis'd</HI> unto them, they could have no knowledge of him. So <HI>misrepresented</HI> shall Good Men often be to the Minds of People, when <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> are <HI>working on the unperswadable Children.</HI> Sir, If ever you find it so, remember that God is now <HI>Trying</HI> of you, whether you will grow in that <HI>Grace;</HI> hold on in that <HI>Good Work;</HI> for which you have hitherto
<PB N="54" REF="002143_0070_0FBC23304C884080"/>had so small Encouragements, in the <HI>Repre∣sentations</HI> of the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> 'Tis a Passage which I have somewhere else met withal, <HI>Tho' I have done good Offices for all Men whatsoever, as they have come in my way, yet a great part of them, whom I have distinguished by doing of something peculiar for them, have afterwards treated me most ungratefully, and abominably; have proved Prodigies of Ingratitude.</HI> Indeed, it is no rare thing, for <HI>Great Services,</HI> to be worse rewarded than <HI>Great Injuries;</HI> They that were lately your <HI>Dependents,</HI> will be shortly your <HI>Defamers.</HI> It is a Maxim of <HI>Seneca</HI> unmasked; <HI>Men bear a secret Hatred unto those who have most obliged them.</HI> Make your self a <HI>Scaffold</HI> for another to rise by; when he is up, he will kick you down if he can. The Prophecy is fulfill'd in Private as well as Publick Instances; <HI>Men shall be un∣thankful.</HI> The <HI>French Protestants</HI> must for this very cause be destroyed by their Tyrant, <HI>because</HI> they brought him to the Throne, and made him able to <HI>Destroy</HI> them. Sir, If <HI>you</HI> meet with such usage too, let it not at all dishearten you from doing unto <HI>Eight,</HI> those <HI>good Offices</HI> which you have done already to <HI>Seven:</HI> But learn to <HI>do Good for its own sake;</HI> do it, <HI>hoping for nothing again.</HI></P>
<P>O Blessed Improvement of <HI>Defamations!</HI> My Friend, Make it, and the issue will be
<PB N="55" REF="002143_0071_0FBC23327B5740F0"/>Glorious. Your Experience will be that, Gen. 49.23, 24. <HI>The Archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him, but his Bow abode in strength.</HI> You know not what <HI>good Arrows</HI> of Service may yet be sent from you among the People of God; perhaps the <HI>more</HI> for the Mischiefs which the <HI>Archers</HI> have attempted upon you. Don't sit down, and sink down under Discourage∣ments, as if your <HI>Opportunities to do Good</HI> would be utterly lost by the malice of your <HI>Defamers,</HI> with a Tempest of <HI>Defamations;</HI> don't say, <HI>I shall one Day perish</HI> by their Hands, on Tongues, or Pens. But say, <HI>O my Soul, Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him!</HI> God will wonderfully rescue your <HI>Opportunities;</HI> they are not at the Disposal of your malicious Enemies. And you know not what may happen to <HI>hamstring</HI> those <HI>Enemies,</HI> or to <HI>muzzel</HI> the <HI>Lions</HI> that you are thrown among. 'Tis very possible they that are now your <HI>Enemies</HI> may come to befriend you wonderfully, and your <HI>Defamers</HI> may prove the very Instruments of your <HI>Good;</HI> yea, of your <HI>doing</HI> more Good, and of that by which your <HI>Fame</HI> will be but advantaged and propagated. I have heard a Servant of God make this Observation, That he has been <HI>Dafamed</HI> and <HI>Abused</HI> by some, and he has out of Obedience to CHRIST, forborn to take notice of it: CHRIST has after∣wards
<PB N="56" REF="002143_0072_0FBC2333F9568B08"/>put it into the Hearts of those very Men signally to assist him in his most valued <HI>Serviceableness.</HI> Yea, If you duly <HI>humble your self under the mighty Hand of God,</HI> and Rage of Man, it would be no new thing, if anon you find the Accomplishment of that Pro∣mise, Zeph. 3.19. <HI>I will get you Praise and Fame in every Place where they have been put to shame.</HI> Or, while these Envious Men are wishing and striving, that you may <HI>come to nothing,</HI> they may do so themselves. <HI>Non ego sic cecidi, quamvis abjectus!</HI> It may be, they will become so <HI>contemptible</HI> and so <HI>miserable,</HI> that you shall have them Objects, not so much of your <HI>Indignation,</HI> as of your <HI>Com∣miseration.</HI> Their <HI>Esteem</HI> shall be very <HI>little,</HI> and the Divine Providence will order it, that they shall be the <HI>less Esteemed</HI> for their dis∣affection unto <HI>you.</HI> It may be, God will give you that room in the Hearts of his People, and such a Testimony in their Consciences and Sentiments, that <HI>Malignity</HI> towards <HI>you</HI> shall be reckon'd a Mark of an <HI>Ill Man</HI> by very many of them. The In∣toxicated Creatures find, that they have in Truth only done the part of a <HI>Viper</HI> in the Fable. Their own Viperous Tongues bleed by licking of the File; but the Ser∣vant of God is found <HI>Invulnerable.</HI> As you know, the Scripture gives it as a <HI>good mark,</HI> to be a <HI>Lover of Good Men;</HI> so when the
<PB N="57" REF="002143_0073_0FBC23367B081F20"/>Poet would Paint out his <HI>Thersites</HI> as a very sorry Wretch, this is the <HI>finishing stroke</HI> of his wretchedness; <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Adversary to the brave Ulysses.</HI> Yea, It is possible God may punish them, with reducing them to low and sad Circumstances, wherein they may need some of your <HI>assistances:</HI> They must fly for help to the very Man, whom they have Abused.; and, Sir, I assure my self that you will readily and heartily help them, and utterly forget all their Abuses, as if they had never been offer'd. The Go∣vernour <HI>Eutropius</HI> did but affront <HI>Chrysos∣tom</HI> for his faithful Rebukes of his <HI>Briberies</HI> and <HI>Oppressions;</HI> anon the Emperor strips <HI>Eutropius</HI> of his Offices, and he is like to fall a Sacrifice unto his Enemies. <HI>Eutropi∣us</HI> the flies to <HI>Chrysostom</HI> for Defence; and <HI>Chrysostom</HI> is the Man who most now defends him from his Enemies. Yea, it is possible that God may bring the fate of a <HI>Pashur</HI> up∣on him that <HI>smites</HI> the Servants of God; and the <HI>smitten Saint</HI> must be the Man, whom the dying and woful Sinner then begs to <HI>Pray</HI> for him; which you may be sure he cannot but do with all the Charity imagi∣nable. Some that have been more than or∣dinarily virulent, and violent, in uttering their Calumnies against Good Men, have hastened upon themselves that which is in∣curred by them who will not <HI>keep their
<PB N="58" REF="002143_0074_0FBC2337A7FB9C68"/>Tongues from Evil,</HI> but that which I know you would be very loth to see come upon the worst of your Calumniators. It was a <HI>strange provision</HI> among the old <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, of the XII Tables, <HI>Si quis carmen occentassit, qnod alteri flagitium parit, Capitale esto.</HI> The plain <HI>English</HI> of that old <HI>Latin</HI> is, <HI>That it was a Capital Thing to Publish a Reproach which procured Infamy to another Man.</HI> Our old <HI>Arnobius,</HI> having occasion to twit the defamatory <HI>Pagans</HI> with it, I find citing it with this Explanation; <HI>Carmen malum con∣scribere, quo Fama alterius Coinquinetur.</HI></P>
<P>The awful Hand of Heaven oftener exe∣cutes that <HI>strange Punishment</HI> than Men are well aware of. <HI>Vavasor Powel's</HI> Maxim was a very true one, <HI>The less a Good Man strives for himself, the more will the Great God strive for him.</HI> Unjust Enemies, who are <HI>false Witnesses, breathing out Cruelty,</HI> being with much Moderation and Resignation of Mind, put over into the Hands of the <HI>Living God,</HI> find it at last a <HI>fearful thing to fall into those Hands;</HI> there are <HI>Arrows</HI> on the <HI>bent Bow</HI> of Providence <HI>ordained against the Persecutors,</HI> (whose <HI>Teeth are Arrows, and their Tongue a sharp Sword;</HI>) None knows how soon the Holy God may let them fly; especially if their Persecutors carry on their Malignity with such unwearied and impetuous moles∣tation, that while <HI>they live,</HI> a diligent Ser∣vant
<PB N="59" REF="002143_0075_0FBC2339317145B8"/>of God can proceed little further in <HI>doing of Good</HI> in the World. At the same time, you don't know what God may do for <HI>you. Moses</HI> had not been so magnified by God, if <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Miriam</HI> had not abused him, and abased him. Something may fall out that shall more Signalize you, and magnify you among the People of God, than any thing that has ever yet befallen you.</P>
<P>GOD is to be adored in such things; but tho' I make the <HI>briefest Mention</HI> of them that is possible, I would not have mentioned them at all, if the things had not been of so <HI>frequent occurrence,</HI> as to be worth your Observation; and at the same time, I know you will desire concerning most of them, that they may not Occur in your own Expe∣rience. You had rather see God <HI>Saving</HI> of your <HI>Personal Enemies,</HI> then for your sake <HI>smiting</HI> of them; and, If you saw the up∣lifted Hand of God ready to discharge Thunder-bolts upon them, you would beg for them, <HI>Lord, spare them, spare them.</HI></P>
<P>I will rather Conclude with this Advice.</P>
<P>PRAYER, PRAYER, which has here∣tofore doubtless been the <HI>Breath of your Life,</HI> ought now more than ever to be so. The best Resolution that you can take up, is that of the Psalmist; <HI>The Mouth of the Wicked, and the Mouth of the Deceitful are o∣pened against me; they have Spoken against
<PB N="60" REF="002143_0076_0FBC233AAA53EC18"/>me with a Lying Tongue; but I give my self unto Prayer.</HI> If the <HI>Storm of Obloquy</HI> upon you be more than ordinary, it looks as if the Lord called you unto something more of <HI>Retirement; Sitting alone</HI> for a while, and <HI>keeping Silence,</HI> and putting your <HI>Mouth in the Dust;</HI> while you give your <HI>Cheek</HI> to him that <HI>Smites</HI> you, and you are <HI>filled full of Reproach.</HI> How many <HI>Psalms</HI> will you in this <HI>Retirement,</HI> and <HI>Religion of the Closet,</HI> find prepared for you, to Direct you, to Support you, to Supply your Supplications? especially, the <HI>Third,</HI> the <HI>Thirteenth,</HI> the <HI>Se∣venteenth,</HI> the <HI>Twenty-Seventh,</HI> the <HI>Thirty-First,</HI> the <HI>Thirty-Eighth,</HI> the <HI>Forty-First,</HI> the <HI>Fifty Fourth,</HI> the <HI>Fifty-Sixth,</HI> the <HI>Eighty-Sixth,</HI> the <HI>Ninety-First,</HI> the <HI>Hundred and Ninth,</HI> the <HI>Hundred and Thirty Eighth,</HI> the <HI>Hundred and Forty Second,</HI> the <HI>Hundred and Forty Third.</HI> The worst of <HI>Dragons</HI> have been Charmed by such <HI>Psalms</HI> as these. My Friend, The <HI>Foot-steps</HI> of God, even when he is <HI>treading</HI> on you, will <HI>drop Fatness</HI> into your Soul; if you are brought unto such Employments, and being made thus Fruitful (tho' in a Low <HI>Valley</HI>) you may <HI>shout &amp; also sing for Joy.</HI> Even when thrown into a <HI>Dung-Cart,</HI> you may be (as the Martyr in that case Express∣ed it,) as <HI>a sweet Odour unto God;</HI> yea, and unto his faithful People too. Be concerned thus to Glorify the Name of your Holy
<PB N="61" REF="002143_0077_0FBC233C4C3C4F18"/>LORD; and fear not; HE will take a suf∣ficient Care of <HI>your Name.</HI> And at the ve∣ry time when your <HI>Name</HI> is trod in the <HI>Dirt,</HI> among <HI>Men</HI> on Earth, it will, being <HI>written in Heaven,</HI> be precious among the <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven, to whom you and your <HI>bringing Forth fruit with Patience,</HI> are made a <HI>Spectacle,</HI> and where a <HI>Crown</HI> of Glory is ready wait∣ing for you. Having brought you <HI>thither,</HI> I cannot break off any where more agreeably but <HI>there,</HI> (whither, My Friend, all you present Sufferings are carrying of you!) <HI>There,</HI> I leave you.</P>

<P>THUS you have seen the <HI>True Way of Shaking off a Viper.</HI> When the <HI>Viper</HI> Coyled about the Hand of the Servant of Christ, (for <HI>Bochart</HI> will allow him to do no more; not consenting to the Christian <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Poets,</HI> who will have the <HI>Teeth</HI> of the <HI>Viper</HI> struck into him;) it was, as one wittily says, <HI>Non ut Laederet, sed ut Ornaret;</HI> not an <HI>Injury,</HI> but an <HI>Orna∣ment</HI> unto him.
