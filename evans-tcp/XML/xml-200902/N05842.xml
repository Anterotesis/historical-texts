<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are many who imagine, that unless their Performances are dedicated to some Great Person of the first Rank, they loose their Value, and are soon thrown aside as useless—yet at the same Time are so lavish of their Talents, that they think themselves hap∣py if they are indulged the Favour of being quite extravagant in stuffing the same with ful∣some Complements, but <HI>laughing in their Sleves,</HI> to use an old homely Saying, while they are en∣deavouring to <HI>ingraciate</HI> themselves into Favor with those they have <HI>no real Regard for.</HI></P>
<P>But the Author of the following Piece thinks himself arriv'd almost to the Pinnacle of Honour, that he can take the Liberty, and hopes to be in∣dulg'd the Favour, of addressing himself to a great Number of <HI>Freemen,</HI> (not forgetting the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who I heard was roused on this Occasi∣on, as well they might, some of whom came to see him afterwards, though he was condemn'd without Benefit of Clergy) in whose Veins there is yet a <HI>free Circulation</HI> of that noble Blood,

some of which was formerly spilt, to <HI>procure the Privileges</HI> we now enjoy under the best of Kings, and that without the least ECLIPSE, unless at some particular Times, when Pride and Ambition fires the Breasts of those who have had some <HI>little Share</HI> in the <HI>Honours of Govern∣ment;</HI> but quite mistaking the End and Design thereof, have run themselves into such <HI>wrong Notions</HI> by their intemperate Zeal, which has even vented itself upon some of those very in∣nocent Persons who gave them their Authority; which for want of Skill to conduct properly, or what is worse, such an high Opinion of them∣selves, that <HI>Reason</HI> for a while has been <HI>de∣thron'd,</HI> and the Imagination they have had of Power above all Law and Reason, has taken Place.—As I am now only speaking of what has been in Times past, I hope no one will think I am aiming at any Person's Conduct in the present Government of Affairs—No, Gen∣tlemen, this is only to put you upon your Guard; I have not the false Complaisance to Flatter those who I am well assured had rather have Truth deliver'd with Simplicity, than only the Appearance thereof in a pompous Stile; and therefore shall take the Liberty of subscribing my self your sincere Friend and humble Servant, while you continue stedfast, and do not give up your <HI>Birth-Rights.</HI>—</P>

<SALUTE>Candid Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is customary for Authors to apologize by Way of Preface to the World for their Writings; and surely those of a low Class I think, ought never to publish without one. In∣deed such great Men as <HI>Lock, Pope, Dryden, Shakespear, Milton,</HI> or <HI>Butler,</HI> need none to their Works, but common Scriblers should offer an Ex∣cuse for troubling the Public; which happens to fall to my Lot at this Time. I must acknowlege, I should have been glad had I remain'd in <HI>Obscu∣rity</HI> as I have done for many Years, and slid out of this <HI>noisy World unnoticed:</HI> But as there is an over-ruling Providence, and every Thing will in the End turn to the Advantage of Truth and Honesty; sometimes even in this Life, but most certainly will in the <HI>future.</HI>—So I desire to be resign'd, waiting for the Event.</P>
<P>But not to be too tedious, or raise the Expectati∣on of the Reader, with more in my Title and Pre∣face, than there is in the Book itself, shall only observe, That I doubt not the following Piece will be thought by many, if not all, who peruse it, to be
<PB N="4" REF="007418_0005_102D8347BA2BC8E0"/>
a <HI>new, remarkable, unprecedented Procedure,</HI> especially as it was done in the <HI>English</HI> Nation: Therefore shall submit this plain, honest Account of the whole Matter, to your better Judgment, who shall take the Pains to give it a reading; and doubt not all proper Allowance will be made, as it is the first Time the Author has taken the Freedom, or rather Courage, to venture without a Pilot, as he would not willingly have any one even <HI>suspected</HI> to be concern'd, lest it should be accounted a <HI>Libel,</HI> and upon that very <HI>SUSPICION,</HI> be thrown into a stinking Stone Goal, though never so innocent, and suffer in the <HI>same Manner</HI> as if he was the <HI>real Author:</HI> without Law, nay, contrary to Law, and in direct Opposition even to the poor dim Light of Nature, if I am not very much mistaken. And as I have experienc'd the same for another Person (and it may perhaps be the Lot of many more, unless divine Providence, in the Use of appointed Means, interpose) yet I would not wish my greatest Enemy to remain there so long, unless I was sure it was lawful to take away his Life, as it had like to have cost me mine—there∣fore would not publish this Affair, if I apprehended any other Person would be thought the Author be∣sides myself, or any ways accessory thereto; but I am well assur'd the plain unpolish'd Stile it ap∣pears in, will convince them to the contrary, and that it is only their bumble Servant,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS there has not any Occurrence for many Years happen'd, especially, in this Country, which has occasion'd <HI>more Speculation</HI> than a late Proceeding of the Lower House of Assembly against the Author of the following Piece, only upon <HI>Suspicion</HI> of his being concern'd in printing and pub∣lishing a Pamphlet entitled, <HI>The MOMSTER of MON∣STERS</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>There has not, says the Author of this Pamphlet, to my Know∣lege, been any</HI> Monster <HI>in this Town; nor any Thing like a</HI> Monster. <HI>There has nothing happened lately which could na∣turally give Occasion to such a</HI> Fiction; <HI>nor any Thing to which it can be justly apply'd in the Way of Allegorical Interpreta∣tion. And the Persons who shall attempt this, must be very</HI> simple, or ill-natur'd, <HI>for it is mercly a</HI> Work of Fancy and Imagination, <HI>of which there is neither Type nor Antitype. And having declar'd this, I think I may innocently let it see the Lights, as a very harmless, toothless Producton, wishing that all other</HI> Romancers <HI>and</HI> Storytellers <HI>had been as fair and ingenuous, to undeceive their Readers—Pag. 23.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Had Expresses been immediately dispatch'd the News could not have flew quicker to the most distant Parts of the Province, and the other Governments upon the Continent; and no Doubt will be the <HI>Wonder</HI> of our <HI>Mother Country,</HI> when they have a true Account of this notable Affair, which if the Reader will but have Patience a while, he will find it was an <HI>unheard of Attack upon the Liberty of an Englishman,</HI> than which scarcely any Thing is dearer, if he has but the
<PB N="8" REF="007418_0007_102D834BC14D30E0"/>
Spirit of a Man: And as my Antagonists in a few Months will become weak as other Men, and loose their Strength, as <HI>Sampson</HI> did when his Locks was shorne, no one can object, but that I shall be upon an Equality with them, so that what was done only by a <HI>pretended Power,</HI> (which is no very good Character, when Laws <HI>human</HI> and <HI>divine,</HI> as well as <HI>Reason,</HI> are set aside) will have a due Consi∣deration.</P>
<P>And though it may be thought by some, a Freedom not becoming a private Person, to complain of a <HI>real</HI> or <HI>sup∣posed Injury</HI> received by those in Authority, and especially of those who are look'd upon the <HI>Guardians of our Liberty,</HI> and the <HI>Fathers of the Country;</HI> yet when its done with a becoming Modesty, and proper Deference, surely every Man who is born free, and especially the <Q>English, who deserve the Liberties they enjoy; and are so much the more wor∣thy of them, as they have spared no Pains to preserve them, whose Breasts are all on Fire for Liberty:</Q> I say, when this is the Case, every Man, who has not <HI>justly forfeited it,</HI> will think he has a Right to vindicate himself, and have the <HI>same Satisfaction,</HI> in Proportion, as if the Injury had been done to any <HI>Gentleman of Fortune,</HI> or <HI>high Character in Life,</HI> as an unjust President establish'd or conniv'd at, may be of <HI>fatal Consequence</HI> to a free Constitation. To use the Words of One who speaking of the different Forms of Government in <HI>Europe,</HI> says, <Q>None of them appears so perfect as that of <HI>England:</HI> Here it is that we find united all the Quali∣fications necessary to make the <HI>People happy,</HI> and the <HI>Prince great,</HI> as long as he is <HI>just.</HI></Q> It was the Opinion of <HI>Solon,</HI> "That a State could not be happy, except the <HI>Magistrates were as Subject to the Laws, as private Persons were to the Magistrates.</HI> According to the Sentiments of this venera∣ble Sage, the Constitution of a Government should be so framed, as to keep an <HI>Equilibrium</HI> between the People and the Prince." As what I am now writing is only an Intro∣duction to something of an extraordinary Nature, hope I shall be excused, and not incur the Censure of being too <HI>verbose,</HI> as perhaps it might give too great a Shock to some Persons,
<PB N="9" REF="007418_0008_102D834D9EADBAB0"/>
and would scareely be credited, unless their Minds were pre∣pared to receive the Truth before hand, which it my Inten∣tion.</P>
<P>And as it is an acknowledged Truth, "That nothing is <HI>so dear</HI> to an <HI>honest Man,</HI> as his good Name, nor ought he to neglect the just Vindication of his Character, when it is <HI>in∣juriously</HI> attack'd by any;"—so this, I think, being my Case, I hope to make it appear to every honest, unprejudiced Person, that I have been most severely, cruelly, and unjustly treated; and that I have a Right from the Laws of GOD and Man to make my Complaint, without a <HI>partial Respect to Persons;</HI> and no one will have Reason to say, <HI>I speak Evil of Dignities,</HI> or of the <HI>Rulers of the People;</HI> for I am deter∣min'd to stick close to the Truth, and certainly that will <HI>pre∣vail</HI> with those who have any Regard for their own Freedom, or their Posterity—</P>
<P>And though I have had many Thoughts concerning the Publication of this Affair, I now think upon the whole, it is for the best; and therefore shall give the Publick the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth; for should this be overlook'd, our <HI>Children perhaps may pay Reverence to a grey-headed Error;</HI> therefore this ought not to be wink'd at, least it should take deeper Root;—but as a faithful Physi∣cion would act, it ought to be cut out, and thrown away as an <HI>eating Canker,</HI> which in a little Time would eat out the <HI>Vitals</HI> of that <HI>noble Principle of Liberty,</HI> for the Sake of which our <HI>pious Forefathers</HI> ventur'd their <HI>Lives,</HI> and all that was <HI>dear</HI> to them—</P>
<P>I would endeavour to use <HI>soft Words</HI> where the Subject will allow of it, so as not to <HI>stir up,</HI> but <HI>turn away</HI> Wrath; and <HI>smoother</HI> than <HI>Oyl,</HI> but at the same Time to <HI>cut like a Razor;</HI> to make it appear I am <HI>Serious,</HI> and in <HI>Earnest</HI>—And there∣fore shall conclude this introductive Part with an Extract from the Letters of <HI>Pliny</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vcl. 2 Book 7.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the 24th of <HI>October</HI> 1754, while at Dinner, I was apprehended by an Order from the <HI>Lower House of Assembly</HI> sign'd <HI>Thomas Hubbard</HI> Speaker, on Suspicion of publishing a Pamphlet, entitled THE MON∣STER OF MONSTERS;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Extract from the Votes of the House of Representatives</HI> October 24th, <HI>P.</HI> 63.
<P><HI>A Complaint being made to the House of a printed Pamphlet, entitled,</HI> The Monster of Monsters, <HI>as reflecting on sundry Members of this House; the said Pamphlet was laid on the Table, and having been read through;—</HI></P>
<P>Resolved, <HI>That the Pamphlet intitled,</HI> the Monster of Monsters, <HI>is a false, scandalous Libel reflecting upon the Pro∣ceedings of the House in general, and on many worthy Mem∣bers in particular, in Breach of the Privileges thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Ordered, <HI>That the said Pamphlet be burnt by the Hands of the common Hangman below the Court-House in King-Street</HI> Boston, <HI>and that the Messenger of the House see the same carried into Execution.</HI></P>
<P>Resolved, <HI>That the Messenger of the House do forthwith take into Custody</HI> Daniel Fowle <HI>of</HI> Boston, <HI>Printer, who they are informed was concerned in printing and publishing the said Pamphlet, and that the Speaker issue his Warrent for that purpose.</HI></P>
<P>Daniel Fowle <HI>was brought into the House, and examined, and then was recommitted to their Messenger by Order of the House.</HI></P>
<P>Joseph Russel <HI>Apprentice to</HI> Daniel Fowle, <HI>was brought into the House, and examined relating to said Pamphlet.</HI></P>
<P>Ordered, <HI>That</HI> Danial Fowle <HI>be committed to the Common Goal in the County of Suffolk; and that the Speaker issue his Warrent accordingly.</HI>—</P>
<P>Resolved, <HI>That the Messenger of the House do forthwith take into Custody</HI> Zechariah Fowle <HI>Printer and</HI> Royal Tyler, <HI>both of</HI> Boston, <HI>who they are informed were concerned in print∣ing and publishing the Pamphlet, intitled,</HI> The Monster of Monsters; <HI>and that the Speaker issue his Warrant for that Purpose</HI>—</P>
<P>Royal Tyler <HI>was brought before the House: Mr. Speaker examined him whether he had been concerned in printing and publishing said Pamphlet? Thereupon said</HI> Tyler <HI>moved for Council.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Which the House took into Consideration, and determin'd that it was not convenient to allow him Council; of which Mr. Speaker inform'd him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then Mr. Speaker again examined him relating to the said Pamphlet, and the only Answer he would make was,</HI> Nemo tenetu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Accusare; <HI>or, a Right of Silence was the Privilege of every Englishman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whereupon he was ordered to remain in the Custody of the House. Then the said</HI> Tyler <HI>moved he might be ad∣mitted to Bail; the Messenger of the House was ordered to withdraw with said</HI> Tyler.</P>
<P><HI>Then the Question was put, Whether the said Request of Mr.</HI> Tyler's <HI>is compatable with the Means the House are tak∣ing to discover the Authors of the said Pamphlet? It pass'd in the Negative.</HI></P></NOTE> and forthwith to make my Appearance before said House to answer to such Questions as should be ask'd me relating to the above Pamphlet;—But before I could be admitted, was confined in the Lobby about an Hour, then was by the Messenger called before the House;
<PB N="12" REF="007418_0011_102D8353D104F2E8"/>
and after my proper Complements before that <HI>Grand Assembly,</HI> was interrogated in the following Manner, by Mr. Speaker, viz. <HI>Do you knew any Thing of the Printing this?</HI>—Holding it out—Upon which I desired it in my own Hands; which was granted:—After looking over it seme Time, I said, it
<PB N="13" REF="007418_0012_102D83558E77F2F0"/>
was not of my printing, neither had I any such Letters in my Print-House:—After some considerable Pause, and the Gentlemen looking upon one another, I was ask'd, <HI>Whether I knew any thing relating to said Book?</HI>—I then desir'd the Opi∣nion of the House, Whether I must answer to that Question? But notwitstanding this reasonable Request, there was no Vote pass'd, that I could perceive, excepting three or four Gentle∣men said <HI>Yes, Yes,</HI> very earnestly: Upon which I inform'd them, I could not say, <HI>I had no Concern;</HI> for as I heard there was such a Pamphlet to sell, I had bought two Dozen, and sold them out of my Shop, and should not tho't any Harm if I had sold an hundred of them. This brought on tne follow∣ing <HI>Questions</HI> and <HI>Answers,</HI> viz. <HI>Who did you buy them of?</HI>—I reply'd, they were sent, I thought, by a young Man, but could not tell his Name.—<HI>Who did he live with?</HI> I then again desir'd the Opinion of the House, Whether I was oblig'd to tell who I bought of?—Three or four again rose up and said <HI>I must:</HI> Upon which I said, I believ'd the young Man liv'd with Mr. <HI>Royal Tyler.</HI> It was then demanded, <HI>Whether I had any Conversation with him about them?</HI> I reply'd, I be∣lieve I might in the same Manner as I had with many others, not that I imagin'd him the Author, or any other Person, for I never agreed with any Body about the Printing of it, neither was it ever offer'd to me. I was then ask'd, <HI>Whether any of my Hands assisted in the doing of it?</HI> I answer'd, I believe my Negro might, as sometimes he work'd for my Brother. I was then queried, <HI>Whether my Brother had any Help?</HI> I said, No. Then a Gentleman said, <HI>Somebody must help him, for one could not print alone:</HI> As this was what I never knew before, I reply'd, one could print, and I could do five hundred with my own Hands.—I was next question'd, <HI>Whether I ever saw any of it while printing?</HI> As I was determin'd to shew no Contempt of Authority, I acknowtedg'd I had seen some of it printing off, as Printers transiently go into one another's Houses.—<HI>Whose House was it?</HI>—I think it was my Bro∣ther's—<HI>What is his Name?</HI>—Zechariah—<HI>Where does he live?</HI> Down by Cross-Street.—One Gentleman stood up and said, <HI>sometime ago I said I bought but two Dozon,</HI> afterwards
<PB N="14" REF="007418_0013_102D83580D2A8778"/>
<HI>I bought a hundred;</HI> to which I reply'd, <HI>I would</HI> have bought a hundred if I could have sold them. Another then stood up and said, before I had Time to answer, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHEN YOU LIE: Upon which I said, Begging your Pardon, Sir, <HI>I know when I</HI> LIE, <HI>and what a Lie is as well as your self:</HI> to which there was no Reply.</P>
<P>They then concluded I was the Author, as I could bring no Body else—I desired I might have a little Time to consi∣der as the Book was publish'd several Months past, and per∣haps I might give more Light in the Affair; but instead of tel∣ling me to go to my Print-House to enquire who brought the Books there, I was <HI>lock'd up for three Hours in the upper Cham∣ber of the Court-House:</HI> Then was ordered down to make my Appearance before the Hon. House a second Time, and was further examined relating to this MONSTROUS BU∣SINESS, to know if I could say any thing more, or give any further Light; (I understood Mr. ROYAL TYLER had been sent for, and examin'd in my Absence) but as I had nothing to correct in my Answers before, told them I could not give any further Light.—Upon which one stood up and said, <HI>when I was in the House before, I said that I bought the Books of</HI> ROYAL TYLER;—Here I was suspicious they intended to get me to acknowledge I had them of him. Which was not true in Fact. I deny'd and said I believe his Boy left them at the Shop. Which I find also I am mistaken in. And after being oblig'd to repeat over great Part of what I had before said, was <HI>ordered again in the above Loft,</HI> where I was confin'd till between nine and ten o'Clock at Night, without Company or Prisoners Fare—From thence was ordered, <HI>Malefactor-like,</HI> attended with a Crowd of Spec∣tators, who were waiting at the Doors, to know the <HI>Event of the Monster,</HI> to his Majesty's Goal in <HI>Boston;</HI> as soon as I was <HI>guarded</HI> to the Prison-Keeper's House, many Friends came to see me, endeavouring to keep up my Spirits; but no one imagin'd what was to follow, nor I myself;—but every one concluded, as Security enough was offer'd, that I might have the best Chamber and Bed in the Prison-Keeper's House; a while after my nearest Friends withdrew, and wish'd me a

good Night. It being now between 11 and 12 at Night, we came to the Point in Hand, <HI>whether I must actually go into the Goal;</HI> I was told I must, and that into the <HI>Stone-one;</HI> this I said was <HI>cruel hard;</HI> but go I must and did; where I now am an Englishman, free born; having been for <HI>many Years entitled to the Privilege of voting for some of the Members of that very House,</HI> by whose Order I am now committed for no other Reason, but upon SUSPICION of printing and publishing the aforesaid Book entitled the MONSTER <HI>of</HI> MONSTERS;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This Affair was thought of so much Conseqnence to the Pub∣lick, that the 25th of</HI> October <HI>being the next Day,</HI>
<P>Resolved, <HI>That the House will now take under Conside∣ration the Affair of</HI> Daniel Fowle, <HI>now in his Majesty Goal.</HI></P>
<P>Resolved, <HI>That it appears to this House, that</HI> Daniel Fowle <HI>has been concerned in pnblishing a Scandalous Pamphlet, intitled,</HI> The Monster of Monsters; <HI>in which the House are greatly reflected on in Breach of their Privileges.</HI> Vot. <HI>p.</HI> 67.</P>
<P>October 26, <HI>The Messenger of the House inform'd the Speaker that</HI> Royal Tyler <HI>requested that he might appear be∣fore the House before they adjourned: He was accordingly admittod into the House, and represented, that his Family was in distressed Circumstances, and pray'd he might be admitted to Bail. Whereupon</HI> Mr. Speaker, <HI>by Order of the House, declared to him, he might return to his Family, provided he gave his Word of Honour to the House, he would be forth coming when by them required: which he accordingly did, and then withdrew.</HI> See Printed Votes of the House, P. 69.</P></NOTE>—but as I have heard of many Wonders in the World, this seems to be the WONDER of WONDERS; and I think from this Time I shall never more wonder at any Thing;—But per∣haps some may say, this is only a Whim, a Fancy of some Lunatick Person, who imagin'd this Thing while he was dreaming of MONSTERS. Can it be true in Fact! Is it possible under the <HI>English Constitution!</HI> Is it possible among a <HI>Free People!</HI> Especially is it any way likely among <HI>New-England Subjects!</HI> Search for a Parralel in all the <HI>English</HI> Records!

<P>Thus far I wrote in Goal the first Night: About 8 o'Clock in the Morning the Prison-Keeper came up into my dark Apartment and said he had Orders not to allow me Pen, Ink, or Paper, which he immediately took from me; and also said his Orders was, Not to let me see or speak with any Body; which perhaps some may think ought not to be <HI>told in</HI> Gath, and that I might have more MODESTY<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">And tho' it is generally thought by many that a Man must be so modest, as not to say any Thing in his own Favour, or justify his own Conduct, for fear it would seem like praising himself; yet as this is only a Modern Notion, I shall here insert the Opinion of the Ancients on this Head, in the Words of a celebrated Writer, who says, <Q>It is most cer∣tain that <HI>Modesty,</HI> according the Idea the Ancients had of it, did not (neither in the Truth of Things does it forbid a Man to speak well of (or justify) himself—<HI>Homer's Ulysses</HI> to borrow the Observation of a very polite and judicious Critick) calls himself the wisest of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> as his <HI>Achil∣les</HI> dees not scruple to represent himself the <HI>best and most valiant of them;</HI> and that too in a Council of all the Princes: I might mention <HI>Virgil</HI> in making <HI>Aeneas</HI> talk frequently of his Piety and Valour—<HI>Socrates</HI> in <HI>Plato, Cyrus, Caesar</HI> and the great Jewish Writers of his Life, &amp;c.—.</Q></NOTE> than to blaze it about, <HI>or publish it in the Streets of</HI> Askelon, &amp;c.</P>

to bring my Mind to my Condition, and <HI>thought</HI> more than I said, as there are no humane Laws against <HI>Think∣ing,</HI> though against <HI>Speaking.</HI> After <HI>Eleven at Night,</HI> when People were generally gone to Rest, I was by the Prison-Keeper and several others, conducted through several Apart∣ments, each of which was secured with Locks and Bolts; on each Door of about 70 Spickes, the Heads of which about two Inches diametor, I walk'd very slow, that I might ob∣serve as I went along; and could not help thinking of those Words, which appear'd very stricking to me, of <HI>walking through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death.</HI> Having got to my Apartment, without any broken Bones, it being an ugly stumbling Way to the Place, an extraordinary <HI>Compo∣sure of Mind ensued;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I would not have any imagine by this, that I was easy, and contented. No, far from that, but if there is any such Thing as a</HI> Hell upon Earth, <HI>I think this Place is the nearest Resem∣blance of any I can conceive of; all I mean by it is, that as I was Conscious I did not deserve this Treatment; but had the proper Exercise of my Reajon; and</HI> Innocence <HI>and a</HI> clear Conscience, <HI>will almost quench the Flame of the most dismal mal Place, to speak parabolically while</HI> Consciousness of Guilt, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Man in the most</HI> delightful Palace.</NOTE> I then fancy'd myself like one of the <HI>old Philosophers,</HI> the Account of whose Lives has been some Entertainment to me, but wish'd for <HI>Diogene's</HI> Tub or Hogshead, or something to keep out the Inclemency of the Weather, for it was a dark stormy Night, and rain'd prodi∣gious hard all next Day. I had no Bed to lodge on, but a Pillow and one Blanket. I walked about, and when tired sat down, and heard the Clock strick every Time from 12 till Eight. There is but one Window, and that without any Thing to keep off the Weather, as there is only several Iron Bars, no Winder-shut, which the <HI>Murderer was favour'd with.</HI> The Place <HI>stunk prodigiously,</HI> which oblig'd me to tye my Handkerchief over my Mouth and Nose, for fear of being <HI>suffocated;</HI> worse than the <HI>Smell of Brimstone.</HI> I heard no Noise for some considerable Time; <HI>all Nature seem'd to be</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="007418_0020_102D8364E77666D8"/>
<HI>dead;</HI> the first stiring of any Thing I could hear, was the Noise of Rats, which seem'd to be of a prodigious Size, and have Reason to think if I had been favour'd with a Club, I might have been the Death of some of them. As I was now depriv'd of all <HI>human Company,</HI> I wished for my little Dog <HI>Corriden,</HI> and was sorry I had not thought of him before, whose Company perhaps I might have been indulg'd. About two o'Clock I heard a most <HI>terrible Groan</HI> as of some human Person, which startled me a little, but had Resolution enough I thought, to encounter, had it been One from the other World; the <HI>Groan appear'd to be very long and piercing:</HI> In a few Minutes after, I spoke out with as strong a Voice as I could, <HI>Who's there!</HI> This seem'd to bring the <HI>Dead to Life;</HI> for I soon found I had roused the Prisoners in the other Apart∣ments, and was immediately answer'd by one who said his Name was <HI>Wyer, I suppose you have heard of me;</HI> he was to have been executed the Thursday following. I told him I was sorry for his Misfortune; and advised him to behave sutably under his Affliction; he thank'd me, and bid me a good Night; he was in the next Room; only a Plank Partition parted us. Soon after I was hail'd by one in the upper Loft, whose Name is <HI>Webb,</HI> to know if I had just come in, and de∣sired I would not take it amiss, as Prisoners were as kind to one another as the Place would allow of; I then told him between eleven and twelve. From that Time till eight the next Morning, I had no more Conversation with any Body; soon after I heard <HI>Wyer</HI> at Prayer, who seem'd to be very peni∣tent, then there was a general Muster of the Prisoners, and calling to one another, some for <HI>Tobacco;</HI> some for <HI>Rum, Sugar, Water,</HI> &amp;c. some <HI>Swearing, Crying</HI> and <HI>Praying;</HI> so that I was entertained with a Variety, which seem'd as though I had got into another World. As I found my Companions must be <HI>Murderers, Thieves, common Cheats,</HI> &amp;c. I imagin'd I might make a good Improvement by conversing with these notorious Sinners: And though it is said <HI>a Man may be known by his Company;</HI> yet I beg Leave to contradict that general prevailing Notion, and differ from some; I think there is an Advantage in being with all Sorts of Persons, if Prudence is
<PB N="22" REF="007418_0021_102D8366A3BA4168"/>
used and the Place does not stink too much. Had I not been here, I should not have known the Behaviour of a poor Melefactor bound in Chains; I should not have had so clear an Idea of that <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Resignation,</HI> which is so much talk'd of, and so little practised in the World. I than desired the Prison Keeper to remove me any where in the Prison, so I might get out of this Place, for I was <HI>almost suffocated with the Smell.</HI> He told me he could not, unless I went above with <HI>Webb;</HI> which I readily accepted of; and in about two Hours after was removed; which Place was <HI>pleasant</HI> in Comparison of the other. I indeavour'd now to make the best of my companion; and though I had heard a <HI>notorious Character of him,</HI> must say, he behaved to me with all the Civility of a good natur'd Man.</P>
<P>*¶* Is it not very unaccountable, as this Affair took up so much Time, and was carried on with <HI>so much Deliberation,</HI> that it was <HI>never</HI> sent up to the Honourable Board, to know if his <HI>Excellency</HI> and <HI>Honours,</HI> (who are two Branches of the Legislature) approved of it? Had this been done, as I think it should, with Submission to better Judgment; and had I been so happy as to have been favour'd with their Opinion, doubt not it would have met with but a <HI>very cool Reception,</HI> and finally thrown out, as not being for the <HI>Dignity of the General Assembly</HI> to take Notice of such an <HI>imaginary Crea∣ture;</HI> or if in their Wisdom should have thought otherwise, I cannot entertain the least Doubt but that the Law would have been the Rule for my Trial, and that it could never find Place in the Heart of a sincere and upright Christian of <HI>prosecuting it to Effect</HI> in the Manner it was done.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Prison-House, Saturday</HI> <DATE>October 26</DATE>. past 12 o'Clock, Forenoon.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I was ordered half a Hour ago by the Prison-Keeper to come out of the close Stone-Goal, into his Dwelling-House, I think it necessary imme∣diately to give some further Account of this <HI>extraordinary Affair,</HI> which is not mention'd fully in my first and second Papers.</P>
<P>I have been 48 <HI>Hours confin'd in a stinking close Stone-Goal,</HI> a particular Account of which I gave in my second Paper. It is now more than ever before a <HI>pleasant Thing for my Eyes to behold the Sun.</HI> I am now allow'd the Use of Pen, Ink, Paper, the Pleasure of seeing my Relations, and many Friends, whom before I knew nothing of. I seem to myself as <HI>one almost risen from the Dead,</HI> and though weak in Body, can perceive a Revival as I have the Liberty of <HI>breathing a freer Air.</HI> While I was in Tribulation, I am inform'd the <HI>People were in Doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</HI> And tho' I had not the Use of the Bible, I cannot re∣member, whether that in particular was forbid me.</P>
<P>But as I have had many Thoughts, some Parts of Scripture came fresh in my Mind, such as, "if this Counsel or this Work be of Men, it will come to Nought;" And that "there is no Wisdom nor Understanding, nor Counsel against the LORD." I was inform'd <HI>about Midnight,</HI> that the Jaylor had received a strict Charge to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> into Prison,</HI> and there to keep me safely, but no Orders to make my <HI>Feet fast in the Stocks.</HI> Afterwards the Keeper himself told <HI>this Saying to me,</HI> which I suppose came <HI>from the Magistrates,</HI> TO LET ME GO; and doubt not I might have departed in Peace: But St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words seem'd to be rivited into me, speaking of himself and
<PB N="24" REF="007418_0023_102D836B44BF58E8"/>
his Fellow-Sufferers, "They have beaten (<HI>or abused</HI>) us openly uncondemn'd (<HI>i.e. by the Law</HI>) being <HI>Romans,</HI> and have cast us into Prison; and now do they thrust us out pri∣vily? Nay, verily, but let them come themselves and fetch us out:" Perhaps their hard Hearts may relent, when they see the Situation we are in, as it is natural for <HI>the Eye to affect the Heart.</HI> So it is applicable in some Measure to my Case, as I was put into the <HI>inner Room</HI> in the Prison, and that at <HI>Midnight, uncondemn'd,</HI> i.e. by the Law; and I am an <HI>En∣glishman,</HI> free-born, not having forfeited my Liberty any more than the <HI>above Romans;</HI> and I now desire that the same Au∣thority that put me in, would by Virtue of that same Power take me out, and not thrust me out privily. I had heard that the Chief Magistrate, and some others, gave this good Advice; <HI>Take heed to yourselves, what ye intend to do as touching those Man.</HI> If any should say <HI>I am mad, or beside my self;</HI> it could not be wondered at considering the Treatment I have un∣justly received; but I can affirm with all seriousness in the Words of <HI>St. Paul, I am not mad, but speak forth the Words of Truth and Soberness.</HI> I only speak freely, and <HI>every Man of common Sense</HI> has this Right, and I think every Man is more or less concern'd in an Affair of this Nature, <HI>for this Thing was not done in a Corner,</HI> unless it was in a Corner of the Court-House. I did nothing that was worthy of Death or of Bonds, the <HI>former</HI> I was in great Danger of, the <HI>latter</HI> I actually experienced; when at the same Time I ought to have been set at Liberty. I have Reason to think twenty four Hours more would have put an End to my Life, for I had catch'd a prodigious Cold the first Night, as the Wind blew hard in upon me the whole Time; and had that been the Case, <HI>what Satisfaction</HI> could have been made to injur'd Innocence? Would it have been any Mitigation, because it was done by the Representatives of the People, or at least by a Number of them? No! the Crime would have been so much the more aggravated, as it cannot be supposed they were ignorant of what they were doing, though I have so much Charity as to think that <HI>forty Men of superior Sense then setting,</HI> would sooner have <HI>cut off</HI> their Hands than been
<PB N="25" REF="007418_0024_102D836D02219BC8"/>
guilty of such a <HI>base Action;</HI> but suppose most Votes carried it.</P>
<P>After I was deliver'd from this doleful, melancholly Stink∣ing Place, into Mr. <HI>Young's</HI> Dwelling House, I had a par∣ticular Account of the Doctor's attending my Wife, who on this Occasion, was thrown into <HI>Fainting Fits,</HI> and <HI>Hes∣terick Disorders,</HI> of which perhaps she may never recover so as to be the same Woman as before. Here is a further Ag∣gravation of this <HI>unprecedented Conduct</HI> of those who had no Right to put me there, as I hope I shall be able to prove—The whole Time she was <HI>forbid Admittance,</HI> who would willingly have kept with me: How then must this appear to a thinking Mind, that the dearer Part of a Man's Self must be as it were torn from him, which <HI>God had join'd together, and no Man had a Right to put asunder,</HI> excepting in some particular Cases, of which there can no Shadow of a Reason be pretended here. I could only hear while in Goal, the tender <HI>Cries of an aged Mother,</HI> for the Sight of her Son, the Intercession of Friends for a Relief, and the encouraging Words of some to keep up a good Heart; and the Pity of the poor Melefactor, who said, he thought I was worse off than himself. Soon after I had got into the Prison-Keeper's House, being weak in Body, and scarcely able to walk, my dear Companion, with Assistance, came in, whose <HI>Paleness and quivering Lips, with Trembling,</HI> was enough to move a Stoick. Here, I acknowlege, I want Words to paint this Scene in <HI>true and lively Colours;</HI> and as I imagine Language, were I capable, would only eclipse a true Idea of it, so I think nothing but a compleat Orator, a Master of Language, per∣fectly acquainted with human Nature, <HI>can draw it to its Life;</HI> therefore shall forbear.</P>
<P>The Day being now far spent, and my Friends taking their Leave, I retired to a Chamber, and went to Rest as soon as I could; having a tolerable Night's Refreshment, I awoke with considerable Strength of Body, heard two Ser∣mons preach'd to the poor Melefactor; as there was a Num∣ber of Persons came to see the Prisoner on this Occasion, there was Enquiry, <HI>how I came out.</HI> I also heard the House had sent for the <HI>Mittemus</HI> on Saturday, and that the Sheriff
<PB N="26" REF="007418_0025_102D836F2ABB3198"/>
would not give up the Orignal, for I was not under Bonds, nor any Body for me, that I should not depart the Prison-Yard; and the Doors and Gates being <HI>frequently open</HI> I had opportunity enough to go out, but being determin'd to show no Contempt of Authority, nor any other Orders, am now, on Monday, (October 28.) still confin'd waiting for the Pleasure of the Hon. House.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Having had my Trial before the Lower House, and</HI> suspected <HI>to be guilty, on Tuesday the fifth Day after Confinement, it was "Ordered,</HI> that <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> be brought to the Bar of the House, and Reprimanded by the Speaker, for his publish∣ing a Scandalous Libel, called, <HI>the Monster of Monsters,</HI> greatly reflecting upon the Honour of this House; and then be discharged, <HI>paying Costs.</HI>
<P>The said <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> was accordingly brought to the Bar of the House, and Reprimanded by the Speaker.</P>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That Mr. Speaker issue his Warrant to the Keeper of his Majesty's Goal, in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> to discharge the said <HI>Daniel Fowle</HI> upon his paying Cost. Which was issued by Mr. Speaker accordingly.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>This Affair, I understand, is the chief Topick of Conver∣sation in Town, and well it may be, for it is a new Thing in the Land. As I live under the Constitution of <HI>England,</HI> shall transcribe a few Thoughts out of that approved Piece, entitled the <HI>Spirit of Laws,</HI> Vol. 1. P. 216, and so on.—</P>
<P>"The Liberty of the Subject is a Tranquility of Mind, arising from the Opinion each Person hath of his Safety. In order to have this Liberty, it is requisite the Government be so constituted as <HI>one Man</HI> need not be <HI>afraid of another."</HI></P>
<P>When the Legislative and Executive Powers are <HI>united, in the same Person,</HI> or in the same <HI>Body of Magistrates,</HI> there can be <HI>no Liberty;</HI> because Apprehensions may arise, least the same Monarch or Senate should enact <HI>tyrannical Laws,</HI> to execute them in a tyrannical Manner."</P>
<P>"Again, There is <HI>no Liberty,</HI> if the <HI>Power of judging</HI> be not <HI>separated</HI> from the Legislative and Executive Powers. Were it join'd with the Legislative, the Life and Liberty of
<PB N="27" REF="007418_0026_102D837124929450"/>

<P>"There would be <HI>an End of every Thing,</HI> were the <HI>same Man,</HI> or the <HI>same Body,</HI> whether of the Nobles or of the People, to exercise those three Powers, that of <HI>enacting Laws,</HI> that of <HI>executing the Publick Resolutions,</HI> and that of <HI>judging the Crimes</HI> or Differences of Individuals."</P>

It may not be amiss here to transcribe some Passages of that excellent Book, entitled the <HI>English Liberties;</HI> or, The <HI>Free-born Subjects Inheritance:</HI> The Author, in his Preface says, "Let us then by perusing this Treatise deeply imprint in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Minds the Laws and Rights that from Age to Age have been deliver'd down to us from our Renown'd Fore-Fathers, and which they so dearly bought and vindicated to themselves at the Expence of so much Blood and Treasure: In a Word, Let them never perish in our Hands, but let us make our Lives happy in the Enjoyment of them, and piously transmit them to our Posterity; being fully convinc∣ed of this Truth, that when <HI>Liberty</HI> is once gone, even <HI>Life itself grows insipid,</HI> and loses all its Relish."</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MAGNA CHARTA, <HI>Pag. 22. Chap. 29. This excellent</HI> Charter <HI>was read at West-minster Hall in Presence of the Nobility and Bishops, with</HI> lighted Candles <HI>in their Hands, the King all the while laying his Hand on his Breast, and at last</HI> solemnnly <HI>Swearing faithfully and inviolably to observe all the Things therein contained, as he was a Man, a Christian, a Soldier, and a King. Then the Bishops extinguished their Can∣dles, throwing them on the Ground, crying,—Thus let him be extinguished and stink in Hell, who</HI> violates <HI>this Charter. It was thought to be so beneficial to the Subject, and a Law of so great equity, in Comparision of those which were formerly in Use, that King</HI> Henry, <HI>for the granting it, had the fifteenth Penny of all the moveable Goods both Temporal and Spiritual.</HI> Cham. <HI>Dict. It is called the</HI> GREAT CHARTER OF LIBERTIES.</NOTE>No Freeman shall <HI>be taken or imprisoned,</HI> or disseised of of his Freehold, or Liberties, or Free Customs, or be out∣lawed; or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed, nor will we pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no Man, we will not deny or defer to any Man, either Justice or Right.</P>
<P><HI>No Freeman shall be taken,</HI> &amp;c. These Words deserve to be written in Letters of Gold, and I have often wondered
<PB N="29" REF="007418_0028_102D837486B0EBD0"/>
that they are not inscribed in CAPITALS, in all our <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Judicature, Town-Halls</HI> and most <HI>publick Edifices;</HI> they be∣ing so essential to our English Freedom and Liberties, and because my <HI>Lord Coke</HI> in the second Part of his <HI>Institutes,</HI> has many excellent Observations on this Chapter; I shall recite his very Words;</P>
<P><HI>That no free Man shall be taken, or imprisoned, but by the Law of the Land,</HI> i. e. by the Common Law, or by the Statute Law, for the <HI>Liberty</HI> of a <HI>Man's Person</HI> is more dear to him than any Thing, and therefore if he be <HI>wronged</HI> in the Liberty, 'tis very reasonable be should be relieved.</P>
<P><HI>No Man shall disseised,</HI> i. e. put out of Seisin or be dispos∣sessed of his Freehold, i. e. of his <HI>Lands</HI> or <HI>Tenements,</HI> or <HI>Live∣lihood,</HI> or of his <HI>Liberties,</HI> or <HI>Free-Customs,</HI> which belong to him as his <HI>Birth-right,</HI> unless it be by Lawful Judgment, i. e. by a Verdict of his Equals, or Men of his own Condition, or by the <HI>Law of the Land,</HI> i. e. to speak once for all, <HI>by the due Course and Process of Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Man shall be taken,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. restrained of his Liberty, by Petition, or Suggestion, to the King or Council, unless it be by Indictment or Presentment, of good and lawful Men, living near the Place where such Deeds were done. The Warrant or <HI>Mittimus,</HI> containing a Lawful Cause, ought to have a Lawful Conclusion, &amp;c. and him safely to keep until he be delivered by Law, &amp;c. and <HI>not</HI> until the <HI>Party commit∣ting</HI> shall farther Order.</P>
<P>If any Man, by <HI>Colour of Authority</HI> where he hath not any in that <HI>particular Case,</HI> shall persume to arrest or imprison any Man, or cause him to be arrested or imprisoned, this is against this Act, and it is <HI>most hateful,</HI> when it is done by <HI>Countenance of Justice.</HI></P>
<P>There are three Things, which the Law of <HI>England</HI> (which is a Law of Mercy) principally regards and taketh Care of, viz. <HI>Life, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Estate.</HI> Next to a Man's Life, the nearest Thing that concerns him, is <HI>Freedom of his Person;</HI> for indeed what is Imprisonment, but a kind of <HI>civil Death?</HI> Therefore, faith <HI>Fortescus,</HI> the Laws of <HI>England</HI> do, in <HI>all Cases,</HI> favour Liberty."</P>

If the Impartial should think upon perusing the foregoing, that I have wrote with any unbecoming Passion or Prejudice, I am willing to acknowlege it. But at the same Time must observe, to use the Words of an excellent Writer, "All <HI>Anger</HI> or <HI>Resentment</HI> cannot be condemned, although there is little lovely in any Degree of it. An intire Insensibility of <HI>all injuries,</HI> of which there are but few Instances, would be a very inconvenient Disposition; exposing a Man to the Con∣turnelies and Petulance of others; nor consistent with his own Character."</P>
<P>Is it not very surprising, such a Vote should pass that House, when I declar'd the Book was not of my printing, neither had I any such Types to print with? If it be said it was put to Vote, and there was a Majority for my Committment, and Mr. Speaker was ordered to sign a Mittemus to put me into the Common Goal, I think he might with as much Propriety have sign'd my <HI>Death Warrant</HI> if order'd. If it then be said, Mr. Speaker was against this Proceeding, could he not in a genteel Manner have excused himself, and desired the House to appoint another for this Case, and considered if he did me Wrong, though by their Influence, or Order, it would not excuse him, unless they had an absolute Power to take away Life at Pleasure—[I here shall insert that Passage in the English Liberties, Pag. 3. "'Tis true the Law itself affirms, the King can do no Wrong; which proceeds not only from a Presumption, that so excellent a Person will do none, but also because he acts nothing but by Ministers, which (from the lowest to the highest) are answerable for their Doings; so that if a King in his Passion should command <HI>A</HI> to kill <HI>B,</HI> without Process of Law, <HI>A</HI> may yet be prosecuted by Indictment, or upon an Appeal, (where no Royal Pardon is allowable) and must for the same be executed, such Command notwith∣standing."] Would he in Fact have done it, had I been his Son in Law, though ordered by the whole General Assembly? No I dare say, he would not; and he certainly must know, or at least ought to know, in order to qualify him for that Office, I was not dealt with in a <HI>due Course and Process of Law;</HI> and that their Power did not extend, in such Cases to
<PB N="31" REF="007418_0030_102D83791ACA5E30"/>
any but their own Members. All I 'desir'd was a fair Trial at Common Law, which I doubt not is founded upon Rea∣son; and if I had been condemn'd, would have endeavoured to be calm and easy, and thrown them in the Heap of Mis∣fortunes Mankind are subject to.</P>
<P>If this was a just Method of Proceeding, why was not the other Printers sent for, and against whom Warrants were issued? It seems there was no Occasion for this; but if they could sacrifice an innocent Person, it might be a Terror to others. Is this just? Has it the Appearance of Justice! Nay, would any of them have carried the Affair to such a monstrous Heighth with a Relation or an Acquaintance? Would Mr. Speaker have sign'd that Mittimus had I been nearly allied to his Family? It is unaccountable, that a Gen∣tleman, who for several Years has had almost the unanimous Vote of this Town to represent them, should act thus, when he must know our Liberties Were <HI>touch'd to the Quick;</HI> (for I would not in the least imagine he could be IGNORANT) and that the plain <HI>English</HI> of establishing such a Precedent would be this: If I can be <HI>secure,</HI> or <HI>protected,</HI> I will do all in my Power to put every Man into the Stone Goal that shall pretend either directly or indirectly to find Fault with the Conduct of the House of Representatives, while I am Speaker, even if they <HI>barely suspected;</HI> and whatever they order, I will sign, and we will be Judges of <HI>Parallels</HI> and <HI>Innuendoes,</HI> though we should incur the Censure of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> who says, "There are a <HI>Sett of Creature</HI> Who have <HI>no Mercy on Pa∣per,</HI> and are ready to <HI>answer,</HI> even when they are <HI>absolute</HI> Strangers to the <HI>Subject."</HI></P>
<P>Strange! That Men who have had Liberty and Property continuallly sounding in their Ears from the Press and Pul∣pit; even from their Infancy, should be guilty of this unac∣countable Conduct? Is the Nature of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong</HI> al∣tered? Is this Glory departing from <HI>New-England</HI> which our Renowned Predecessors purchased with so much Blood and Treasure? We hope not. We have our Courts of Justice not yet overthrown: For we have the Grand Privilege of <HI>Trials,</HI> by our Country, that is by <HI>Juries;</HI> and I hope never to see
<PB N="32" REF="007418_0031_102D837B03E5F0A8"/>
the Day, when the People of this Country, will be so <HI>stupid</HI> as <HI>tamely</HI> to give up the Privilege they of Right enjoy; but always have a Godly Jealousy, when there is the least En∣croachment either in <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Religious</HI> Affairs, and more especially when the very <HI>Foundation</HI> is struck at; and act like Men; fear not stern Countenances, the Threats of a Prison, nor the rattling of Chains; but imitate the noble Courage of your Fathers, who are now sleeping quietly in the Dust, and fear'd none of these Things, as they knew they were acting in a just Cause; and have overcome, and no Doubt gain'd the Prize: For should you act an <HI>inglorious</HI> Part, and they, could rise out of their Graves, you would not be acknow∣leged as their Children, but the <HI>degenerate Plants</HI> of a strange Vine.</P>
<P>Now while we have Opportunity, let us consider, that as <HI>Life</HI> once lost, can never be recovered; so when <HI>Liberty</HI> is banish'd, or by bad Treatment, takes it Flight to another Climate, where it will be kindly receiv'd, it's almost as im∣possible to recover it again in its native Beauty, as it is for the <HI>Ethiopian to change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alhough I could inlarge, with Assistance, from the best Au∣thors, who wrote on the</HI> Original of Civil Government, The internal Structure of States, <HI>and the</HI> several Parts of the su∣preme Power, The Downfall of Tyranny &amp;c. <HI>and show where∣in the Author of the foregoing Piece has been treated contrary to, and in direct Violation of all the Laws of the</HI> English Nation; <HI>but must reserve these Thoughts, with an</HI> APPENDIX, <HI>for ano∣ther Opportunity.</HI></P>
