<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS mankind from one parent are divided into many fami∣lies, and as trading to sea is greatly increased within a few ages past; amidst this extended commerce how necessary is it that the profes∣sed followers of Christ keep sacred his holy name, and be employed about trade and traffick no far∣ther than justice and equity evi∣dently accompanies? that we may give no just cause of offence to any, however distant, or unable to plead their own cause; and may conti∣nually keep in view, the spreading of the true and saving knowledge of God, and his Son Jesus Christ, amongst our fellow creatures, which through his infinite love some feel to be more precious than any other treasure.</P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS ON THE TRUE HARMONY OF MANKIND; And how it is to be maintained.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> On serving the Lord in our outward Employments.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the humbling dispensations of the Father of mercies, I have felt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inward labour for the good of my fellow creatures, and a concern that the holy spirit, which alone can restore mankind to a state of true harmony, may with singleness of heart be waited for and followed.</P>
<P>I TRUST there are many under that vi∣sitation, which if faithfully attended to will make them quick of understanding in the
<PB N="4" REF="011948_0003_0F8788778E3FA4E0"/>
fear of the Lord, and qualify with firmness to be true patterns of the Christian life, who in living and walking may hold forth an in∣vitation to others, to come out of the entan∣glements of the spirit of this world.</P>
<P>AND that which I feel first to express is, a care for those who are in circumstances, which appear difficult, with respect to sup∣porting their families in a way answerable to pure wisdom, that they may not be dis∣couraged, but remember that in humbly obeying the leading of Christ, he owneth us as his friends, <HI>Ye are my friends if ye do what∣soever I command you;</HI> and to be a friend to Christ, is to be united to him, who hath all power in heaven and in earth; and though a woman may forget her sucking child, yet will he not forget his faithful ones.</P>
<P>THE condition of many who dwell in ci∣ties hath often affected me with a brotherly sympathy, attended with a desire that resig∣nation may be laboured for; and where the holy leader directeth to a country life or some change of employ, he may be faithfully followed; for under the refining hand of the Lord I have seen that the inhabitants of some cities are greatly increased through some branches of business which his holy spi∣rit doth not lead into, and that being entan∣gled in these things, tends to bring a cloud over the minds of people convinced of the leadings of this holy leader, and obstructs
<PB N="5" REF="011948_0003_0F8788778E3FA4E0"/>
the coming of the kingdom of Christ on earth as it is in heaven.</P>
<P>NOW if we indulge a desire to imitate our neighbours in those things which harmonise not with the true Christian walking, these entanglements may hold fast to us, and some, who in an awakening time, feel tender scruples, with respect to their manner of life, may look on the example of others more no∣ted in the church, who yet may not be re∣fined from every degree of dross; and by looking on these examples, and desiring to support their families in a way pleasant to the natural mind, there may be danger of the worldly wisdom gaining strength in them, and of their departure from that pure feeling of truth, which if faithfully attend∣ed to, would teach contentment in the di∣vine will, even in a very low estate.</P>
<P>ONE formerly speaking on the profita∣bleness of true humility saith, <Q>He that troubles not himself with anxious tho'ts for more than is necessary, lives little less than the life of Angels, whilst by a mind content with little, he imitates their want of nothing. Cave's prim. Christi. page 31.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT is not enough, says Tertullian, that a Christian be chaste and modest, but he must appear to be so: a virtue of which he should have so a great store, that it should flow from his mind upon his habit,
<PB N="6" REF="011948_0004_0F8788785CEA34D8"/>
and break from the retirements of his conscience, into the superficies of his life. Same book, page 43.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE garments we wear, says Clemens, ought to be mean and frugal—that is true simplicity of habit, which takes away what is vain and superfluous; that the best and most solid garment, which is the farthest from curiosity. Page 49.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the change from day to night, is by a motion so gradual as scarcely to be perceived, yet when night is come we be∣hold it very different from the day; and thus as people become wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight; customs rise up from the spirit of this world, and spread by little and little, till a departure from the simplicity that there is in Christ, becomes as distinguishable as light from darkness, to such who are crucified to the world.</P>
<P>OUR holy Shepherd, to encourage his flock in firmness and perseverance, reminds them of his love for them, <HI>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you; continue ye in my love;</HI> and in another place graciously points out the danger of departing therefrom, by going into unsuitable employments; this he represents in the similitude of offence from that useful active member, the hand; and to fix the instruction the deeper, names the right hand, <HI>If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee</HI>—If thou feelest of∣fence
<PB N="7" REF="011948_0004_0F8788785CEA34D8"/>
in thy employment, humbly follow him who leads into all truth, and is a strong and faithful friend to those who are resigned to him.</P>
<P>AGAIN, he points out those things which appearing pleasant to the natural mind, are not best for us, in the similitude of offence from the eye, <HI>If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out, and cast it from thee.</HI> To pluck out the eye, or cut off the hand, is attended with sharp pain; and how precious is the instructi∣on which our Redeemer thus opens to us, that we may not faint under the most pain∣ful trials, but put our trust in him, even in him who sent an Angel to feed Elijah in the wilderness; who fed a multitude with a few barley loaves, and is now as attentive to the wants of his people as ever.</P>
<P>THE prophet Isaiah, represents the un∣righteous doings of the Israelites toward the poor, as the fruits of an effeminate life, <HI>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them; what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, saith the Lord God.</HI> Then he men∣tions the haughtiness of the daughters of Sion, and enumerates many ornaments, as instances of their vanity, to uphold which, the poor were so hardly dealt with, that he sets forth their poverty, their leanness and in∣ability to help themselves, in the similitude of a man maimed by violence or <HI>beaten to</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="011948_0005_0F8788798AF98E18"/>
and forced to endure the painful operation of having his face gradually worn away in the manner of grinding.</P>
<P>AND I may here add, that at times, when I have felt true love open my heart towards my fellow creatures, and been engaged in weighty conversation in the cause of righ∣teousness, the instructions I have received un∣der these exercises, in regard to the true use of the outward gifts of God, have made deep and lasting impressions on my mind.</P>
<P>I HAVE here beheld, how the desire to provide wealth, and to uphold a delicate life hath grievously entangled many, and been like snares to their ofspring; and though some have been affected with a sense of their difficulties, and appeared desirous, at times, to be helped out of them; yet for want of abiding under the humbling power of truth, they have continued in these entangle∣ments; for in remaining comformable to this world, and giving way to a delicate life, this expensive way of living, in parents and in children, hath called for a large supply, and in answering this call <HI>the faces of the poor</HI> have been ground away, and made thin through hard dealing.</P>
<P>THERE is balm, there is a physician! and O what longings do I feel! that we may em∣brace the means appointed for our healing, know that removed which now ministers cause for the cries of many people to ascend
<PB N="9" REF="011948_0005_0F8788798AF98E18"/>
to heaven against their oppressors, and that we may see the true harmony restored.</P>
<P>BEHOLD <HI>how good and how pleasant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</HI> The na∣ture of this unity is thus opened by the apostle, <HI>If we walk in the light, as Christ is in the light, we shall have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Christ will cleanse us from all sin.</HI></P>
<P>THE land may be polluted with inno∣cent blood, which like the blood of Abel may cry to the Almighty; but those who <HI>walk in the light as Christ is in the light,</HI> they know the <HI>lamb of God, who taketh away sin.</HI></P>
<P>WALKING is a phrase frequently used in scripture, to represent our journey through life, and appears to comprehend the various affairs and transactions properly relating to our being in this world.</P>
<P>CHRIST being the light, dwells always in the light, and if our walking be thus, and in every affair and concern we faithfully fol∣low this divine leader; he preserves from giving just cause for any to quarrel with us; and where this foundation is laid and mutu∣ally kept to, by families conversant with each other, the way is open far these com∣forts in society, which our heavenly father intends as a part of our happiness in this world; and then we may experience the goodness, and pleasantness of dwelling to∣gether in unity; but where ways of living
<PB N="10" REF="011948_0006_0F87887A2C51AC30"/>
take place, which tend to oppression, and in the pursuit of wealth, people do that to others which they know would not be ac∣ceptable to themselves, either in exercising an absolute power over them, or otherwise laying on them unequitable burdens; here a fear lest that measure should be meeted to them, which they have measured to others, incites a care to support that by craft and cunning devices which stands not on the firm foundation of righteousnese: thus the harmony of society is broken, and from hence commotions and wars do frequently arise in the world.</P>
<P>COME <HI>out of Babylon my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI> Rev. xv. 3, 4. This Babel, or Babylon, was built in the spirit of self-ex∣altation; <HI>Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven, and let us make us a name.</HI> Gen. xi. 4. In departing from an humble trust in God, and following a self∣ish spirit, people have intentions to get the upperhand of their fellow creatures, pri∣vately meditate on means to obtain their ends, have a language in their hearts which is hard to understand. In Babel the lan∣guage is confounded.</P>
<P>THIS city is represented as a place of busi∣ness and those employed in it, as merchants of the earth: <HI>The merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delica∣cies.</HI> Rev. xviii. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011948_0006_0F87887A2C51AC30"/>AND it is remarkable in this call, that the language from the father of mercies is, my people, <HI>Come out of Babylon my people!</HI> Thus his tender mercies are toward us in an imperfect state; and as we faithfully at∣tend to the call, the path of righteousness is more and more opened; cravings, which have not their foundation in pure wisdom, more and more cease; and in an inward pu∣rity of heart, we experience a restoration of that which was lost at Babel, represented by the inspired prophet in the <HI>returning of a pure language.</HI> Zep. iii. 9.</P>
<P>HAPPY for them who humbly attend to the call, <HI>Come out of Babylon my people.</HI> For though in going forth we may meet with tryals, which for a time may be painful, yet as we bow in true humility, and continue in it, an evidence is felt that God only is wise; and that in weaning us from all that is selfish he prepares the way to a quiet habitation where all our desires are bounded by his wisdom. And an exercise of spirit attends me, that we who are convinced of the pure leadings of truth, may bow in the deepest reverence, and so watchfully regard this lea∣der, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> who are grievously entan∣gled in a wilderness of vain customs, may look upon us, and be instructed. And O that such who have plenty of this world's goods, may be faithful in that with which they are entrusted! and example others in the true christian walking.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="011948_0007_0F87887B9D6F8D90"/>OUR blessed Saviour, speaking on world∣ly greatness, compares himself to one wait∣ing and attending on a company at dinner: <HI>Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am amongst you as he that serveth.</HI> Luke xxii. 27.</P>
<P>THUS in a world greatly disordered, where men aspiring to outward greatness were wont to oppress others to support their designs, he who was of the highest descent, being the Son of God, and greater than any amongst the greatest families of men, by his example and doctrines foreclosed his followers from claiming any shew of outward greatness, from any supposed superiority in themselves, or derived from their ancestors.</P>
<P>HE who was greater than earthly Princes was not only meek and low of heart, but his outward appearance was plain and lowly, and free from every stain of the spirit of this world.</P>
<P>SUCH was the example of our blessed Re∣deemer, of whom the beloved disciple said, <HI>He that saith he abideth in him, ought also to walk even as he walked.</HI></P>
<P>JOHN BRADFORD, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>red martyr∣dom, under Queen Mary, wrote a letter to his friends out of prison, a short time before he was burnt, in which are these expressi∣ons; "Consider your dignity as children of God and temples of the Holy Ghost, <HI>and
<PB N="13" REF="011948_0007_0F87887B9D6F8D90"/>
members of Christ,</HI> be ashamed therefore to think, speak or do any thing unseemly, for God's children <HI>and the members of Christ.</HI> Fox, acts and mon. page 1177.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> On the Example of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>AS my mind hath been brought into a brotherly feeling with the poor, as to the things of this life, who are under tryals in regard to getting a living in a way an∣swerable to the purity of truth; a labour of heart hath attended me, that their way may not be made difficult through the love of mo∣ney in those who are tryed with plentiful estates, but that they with tenderness of heart may sympathize with them.</P>
<P>IT was the saying of our blessed Re∣deemer, <HI>Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</HI> There is a deep feeling of the way of purity, a way in which the wisdom of the world hath no part, but is opened by the spirit of truth, and is <HI>called the way of holiness;</HI> a way in which the traveller is employed in watching unto prayer; and the outward gain we get in this journey is considered as a trust com∣mitted to us, by HIM who formed and sup∣ports
<PB N="14" REF="011948_0008_0F87887C06742150"/>
the world; and is the rightful director of the use and application of the product of it.</P>
<P>NOW except the mind be preserved chaste, there is no safety for us; but in an estrange∣ment from true resignation, the spirit of the world casts up a way, in which gain is many times principally attended to, and in which there is a selfish application of outward trea∣sures.</P>
<P>HOW agreeable to the true harmony of so∣ciety, is that exhortation of the Apostle? <HI>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>A PERSON in outward prosperity may have the power of obtaining riches, but the same mind being in him which is in Christ Jesus, he may feel a tenderness of heart towards those of low degree; and instead of setting himself above them, may look upon it as an unmerited favour, that his way through life is more easy than the way of many others; may improve every opportunity of leading forth out of those customs which have en∣tangled the family; employ his time in look∣ing into the wants of the poor members, and hold forth such a perfect example of humi∣liation, that the pure witness may be reach∣ed in many minds; and the way opened for a harmonious walking together.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011948_0008_0F87887C06742150"/>JESUS CHRIST, in promoting the happi∣ness of others, was not deficient in looking for the helpless, who lay in obscurity, nor did he save any thing to render himself ho∣nourable amongst men, which might have been of more use to the weak members in his Father's family; of whose compas∣sion towards us I may now speak a little. He who was perfectly happy in himself, mov∣ed with infinite love, <HI>took not upon him the na∣ture of Angels,</HI> but our imperfect natures, and therein wrestled with the temptations which attend us in this life; and being the Son of HIM who is greater than earthly Princes, yet became a companion to poor, sincere heart∣ed men; and though he gave the clearest evidence that divine power attended him, yet the most unfavourable constructions were framed by a self righteous people; those miracles represented as the effect of a diabolical power, and endeavours used to render him hateful, as having his mission from the prince of darkness; nor did their en∣vy cease till they took him like a criminal and brought him to tryal. Though some may affect to carry the appearance of being unmoved at the apprehension of distress, our dear Redeemer, who was perfectly sin∣cere, having the same human nature which we have, and feeling, a little before he was apprehended, the weight of that work upon him, for which he came into the world, was
<PB N="16" REF="011948_0009_0F87887F18C54730"/>
<HI>sorrowful even unto death;</HI> here the human nature struggled to be excused from a cup so bitter; but his prayers centered in resignation, <HI>Not my will but thine be done.</HI> In this conflict, so great was his agony that <HI>sweat like drops of blood fell from him to the ground.</HI></P>
<P>BEHOLD now as foretold by the prophet, he is in a judicial manner <HI>numbered with the transgressors.</HI> Behold him as some poor man of no reputation, standing before the high priest and elders, and before Herod and Pi∣late, where witnesses appear against him, and he mindful of the most gracious design of his coming, declineth to plead in his own defence, <HI>but as a sheep that is dumb before his shearer,</HI> so under many accusations, revilings and buffetings remained silent. And tho' he signified to Peter that he had access to power sufficient to overthrow all their out∣ward forces; yet retaining a resignation to suffer for the sins of mankind, he exerted not that power, but permitted them to go on in their malicious designs, and pronounce him to be worthy of death, even him who was perfect in goodness; thus <HI>in his humilia∣tion his judgment was taken away,</HI> and he, like some vile criminal, <HI>led as a lamb to the slaugh∣ter.</HI> Under these heavy tryals (though poor unstable Pilate was convinced of his inno∣cence, yet) the people generally looked upon him as a deceiver, a blasphemer, and the ap∣proaching punishment as a just judgment
<PB N="17" REF="011948_0009_0F87887F18C54730"/>
upon him, <HI>They esteemed him smitten of God and afflicted.</HI> So great had been the surprize of his disciples, at his being taken by armed men, that they <HI>forsook him and fled;</HI> thus they hid their faces from him, he was de∣spised, and by their conduct it appeared as though <HI>they esteemed him not.</HI></P>
<P>BUT contrary to that opinion, of his being smitten of God and afflicted, it was for our sakes that <HI>he was put to grief; he was wound∣ed for our transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities;</HI> and under the weight of them ma∣nifesting the deepest compassion for the instru∣ments of his misery, laboured as their ad∣vocate, and in the deeps of affliction, with an unconquerable patience, cried out, <HI>Father forgive them, they know not what they do!</HI></P>
<P>NOW this mind being in us, which was in Christ Jesus, it removes from our hearts the desire of superiority, worldly honour or greatness; a deep attention is felt to the di∣vine counsellor, and an ardent engagement to promote, as far as we may be enabled, the happiness of mankind universally; this state, where every motion from a selfish spirit yieldeth to pure love, I may, with grati∣tude to the father of mercies acknowledge, is often opened before me as a pearl to dig after; attended with a living concern, that amongst the many nations and families on the earth, those who believe in the Messiah, that <HI>he was manifested to destroy the works of
<PB N="18" REF="011948_0010_0F8788802CF28FB0"/>
the Devil, and</HI> thus to <HI>take away the sins of the world,</HI> may experience the will of our heaven∣ly Father, <HI>may be done on earth as it is in Hea∣ven.</HI> Strong are the desires I often feel, that this holy profession may remain unpolluted, and the believers in Christ may so abide in the pure inward feeling of his spirit, that the wisdom from above may shine forth in their living, as a light by which others may be in∣strumentally helped on their way, in the true harmonious walking.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> On Merchandizing.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE the treasures of pure love are opened, and we obediently fol∣low him who is the light of life, the mind becomes chaste; and a care is felt, that the unction from the holy one may be our leader in every undertaking.</P>
<P>IN being crucified to the world, broken off from that friendship which is enmity with God, and dead to the customs and fashions which have not their foundation in the truth; the way is prepared to lowliness in outward living, and to a disentangle∣ment from those snares which attends the
<PB N="19" REF="011948_0010_0F8788802CF28FB0"/>
love of money; and where the faithful friends of Christ are so situated that mer∣chandize appears to be their duty, they feel a restraint from proceeding farther than he owns their proceeding; being convinced that <HI>we are not our own but are bought with a price, that none of us may live to ourselves, but to him who died for us.</HI> 2 Corin. v. 15. Thus they are taught, not only to keep to a moderate advance and uprightness in their dealings; but to consider the tendency of their pro∣ceeding; to do nothing which they know would operate against the cause of univer∣sal righteousness; and to keep continually in view the spreading of the peaceable king∣dom of Christ amongst mankind.</P>
<P>THE prophet Isaiah spake of the gathered church, in the similitude of a city, where many being employed were all preserved in purity; <HI>They shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou shalt be called sought out, a city not forsaken.</HI> lxiii. 10. And the apostle after mentioning the mystery of Christ's sufferings exhorts, <HI>Be ye holy in all manner of conversation.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 15. There is a conversation necessary in trade; and there is a conversation so foreign from the nature of Christ's kingdom, that it is repre∣sented in the similitude of one man pushing another with a warlike weapon, <HI>There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword.</HI> Prov. xii, 18. Now in all our concerns it is ne∣cessary
<PB N="20" REF="011948_0011_0F878881AF4F2138"/>
that the leading of the spirit of Christ be humbly waited for and faithfully follow∣ed, as the only means of being preserved chaste as an holy people, who <HI>in all things are circumspect.</HI> Exod. xxiii. 13, that no∣thing we do may carry the appearance of approbation of the works of wickedness, make the unrighteous more at ease in un∣righteousness, or occasion the injuries com∣mitted against the oppressed to be more lightly looked over.</P>
<P>WHERE morality is kept to, and support∣ed by the inhabitants of a country, there is a certain reproach attends those individuals amongst them, who manifestly deviate there∣from. Thus, if a person of good report, is charged with stealing goods out of an open shop in the day time, and on a public tryal found guilty, and the law in that case put in execution, he therein sustains a loss of repu∣tation; but if he be convicted a second and third time of the like offence, his good name would cease amongst such who knew these things. If his neighbour, reputed an ho∣nest man, being charged with buying goods of this thief, at a time when the purchaser knew they were stolen, and on a publick tryal is found guilty, this purchaser would meet with disesteem, but if he persisted in buying stolen goods, knowing them to be such, and was publickly convicted thereof a second and third time, he would no longer
<PB N="21" REF="011948_0011_0F878881AF4F2138"/>
be considered as an honest man by them who knew these things; nor would it appear of good report to be found in his company buying his traffick, till some evident tokens of sincere repentance appeared in him. But where iniquity is committed openly, and the authors of it are not brought to justice, nor put to shame, their hands grow strong. Thus the general corruption of the Jews shortly before their state was broke up by the Chaldeans, is described by their bold∣ness in impiety; for as their leaders were connected together in wickedness, they strengthened one another, and grew con∣fident, <HI>Were they ashamed when they had com∣mitted abominations? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.</HI> Jer. vi. 15, on which account the Lord thus expostu∣lates with them, <HI>What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee, when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</HI> Jer. xi. 15.</P>
<P>NOW the faithful friends of Christ, who hunger and thirst after righteousness, and in∣wardly breathe that his kingdom may come on earth as it is in heaven, he teacheth them to be quick of understanding in his fear, and to be very attentive to the means he may ap∣point for promoting pure righteousness in the earth; and as shame is due to those whose works manifestly operate against the gracious design of his sufferings for us, a care lives on
<PB N="22" REF="011948_0012_0F8788821144E218"/>
their minds that no wrong customs however supported may byass their judgments, but that they may humbly abide under the cross and be preserved in a conduct which may not contribute to strengthen the hands of the wicked in their wickedness, or to remove shame from those to whom it is justly due. The coming of that day is precious in which we experience the truth of this expression. <HI>The Lord our righteousness.</HI> Jer. xiii. 6, and feel him to be <HI>made unto us wisdom and sanctificati∣on.</HI></P>
<P>THE example of a righteous man is often looked at with attention. Where righteous men join in business their company gives en∣couragement to others; and as one grain of incense deliberately offered to the prince of this world, renders an offering to God in that state unacceptable; and from those esteemed leaders of the people may be injurious to the weak; it requires deep humility of heart, to follow him faithfully, who alone gives sound wisdom and the spirit of true discerning; and O how necessary it is, to consider the weight of a holy profession!</P>
<P>THE conduct of some formerly, gave occa∣sion of complaint against them, <HI>Thou hast de∣filed thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine ini∣quities, by the iniquity of thy traffick.</HI> Ezek. xxviii. 18, and in several places it is charged against Israel that they had polluted the holy name.</P>

in the similitude of being purged from that which is fuel for fire; and particu∣larly describes the outward fruits, brought forth by those who dwell in this inward holiness <HI>they walk righteously, and speak uprightly.</HI> By <HI>walking</HI> he represents the journey through life, as a righteous journey; and <HI>by speaking up∣rightly,</HI> seems to point at that which Moses appears to have had in view, when he thus express'd himself, <HI>Thou shalt not follow a multi∣tude to do evil, nor speak in a case to decline after many to wrest judgment.</HI> Exod. xxiii. 2.</P>
<P>HE goes on to shew their firmness in equity; representing them as persons superior to all the arts of getting money, which have not righteousness for their foundation; <HI>They de∣spise the gain of oppressions:</HI> and further shews how careful they are that no prospects of gain may induce them to become partial in judgment respecting an injury; <HI>They shake their hands from holding bribes.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, where any interest is so connec∣ted with shedding blood, that the cry of inno∣cent blood goes also with it; he points out their care to keep innocent blood from crying against them, in the similitude of a man stop∣ping his ears to prevent a sound from entering his head, <HI>They stop their ears from hearing blood;</HI> and where they know that wickedness is com∣mitted, he points out with care, that they do not by an unguarded friendship with the authors of it, appear like unconcerned look∣ers
<PB N="24" REF="011948_0013_0F87888310985E08"/>
on, but as people so deeply affected with sorrow, that they cannot endure to stand by and behold it; this he represents in the simi∣litude of a man <HI>shutting his eyes from seeing evil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHO amongst us shall dwell with devouring fire? Who amongst us shall dwell with everlast∣ing burnings? He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly. He that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from hold∣ing of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.</HI> Isa. 33.15.</P>
<P>HE proceeds in the spirit of prophecy to shew how the faithful being supported under temptations, would be preserved from that defilement that there is in the love of money; that as they who in a reverent waiting on God, feel their strength renewed, are said to <HI>mount upward;</HI> so here their preservation from the snare of unrighteous gain, is repre∣sented in the likeness of a man, borne up above all crafty, artful means of getting the advantage of another, <HI>They shall dwell on high;</HI> and points out the stability and firmness of their condition, <HI>His place of defence shall be the munition of rocks;</HI> and that under all the outward appearances of loss, in denying himself of gainful profits for righteousness sake, yet through the care of him who pro∣vides for the sparrows, he should have a supply answerable to his infinite wisdom, <HI>Bread shall
<PB N="25" REF="011948_0013_0F87888310985E08"/>
be given him, his waters shall be sure.</HI> And as our Saviour mentions the sight of God to be attainable by <HI>the pure in heart,</HI> so here the pro∣phet pointed out, how in true sanctification the understanding is opened, to behold the peaceable harmonious nature of his kingdom <HI>thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty:</HI> and that looking beyond all the afflictions which attend the righteous, to <HI>a habitation eternal in the heavens,</HI> they with an eye divinely open <HI>shall behold the land that is very far off.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He shall dwell on high, his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks, bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.</HI> Isa. xxxiii. 16.</P>
<P>I OFTEN remember, and to me the subject is awful, that the great Judge of all the earth doeth that which is right, and that he <HI>before whom the nations are as the drop of a bucket</HI> is <HI>no respecter of persons.</HI> Happy for them, who like the inspired prophet, <HI>in the way of his judgments wait for him.</HI> Isaiah xxvi. 8.</P>
<P>WHEN we feel him to sit as a refiner with fire, and know a resignedness wrought in us, to that which he appoints for us, his blessing in a very low estate, is found to be more pre∣cious than much outward treasure in those ways of life where the leadings of his spirit are not followed.</P>
<P>THE prophet in a sight of a divine work a∣mongst many people, declared in the name of the Lord, <HI>I will gather all nations and tongues,
<PB N="26" REF="011948_0014_0F878883905BF918"/>
and they shall come and see my glory.</HI> Isaiah lxvi. 18. And again, <HI>from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, my name shall be great amongst the gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure of∣fering.</HI> Malachi i. 11.</P>
<P>BEHOLD here how the prophets had an inward sense of the spreading of the kingdom of Christ; and how he was spoken of as one who should <HI>take the heathen for his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for his possession.</HI> Psal. ii. 8. That <HI>he was given for a light to the Gentiles; and for salvation to the ends of the earth.</HI> Isaiah xlix. 6.</P>
<P>WHEN we meditate on this divine work, as a work of ages; a work that the prophets felt long before Christ appeared visibly on earth, and remember the bitter agonies he endured when he <HI>poured out his soul unto death,</HI> that the heathen nations, as well as others, might come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved.</P>
<P>When we contemplate on this marvellous work, as that which <HI>the Angels desire to look in∣to.</HI> i. Pet. i. 12. And behold people amongst whom this light hath eminently broken forth, and who have received many favours from the bountiful hand of our heavenly Father; not only indifferent with respect to publish∣ing the glad tidings amongst the Gentiles, as yet sitting in darkness and entangled with
<PB N="27" REF="011948_0014_0F878883905BF918"/>
many superstitions; but aspiring after wealth and worldly honours, take hold of means to obtain their ends, tending to stir up wrath and indignation, and to beget an abhorrence in them to the name of christianity. When these things are weightily attended to, how mournful is the subject?</P>
<P>IT is worthy of remembrance, that peo∣ple in different ages, deeply baptised into the nature of that work for which Christ suffered, have joyfully offered up their liberty and lives for the promoting of it in the earth.</P>
<P>POLICARP, who was reputed a disciple of St. John, having attained to great age, was at length sentenced to die for his religion, and being brought to the fire, prayed nearly as follows, "Thou God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom I have received the knowledge of thee! O God of the angels and powers and of every living creature, and of all sorts of just men which live in thy pre∣sence. I thank thee! that thou hast graciously vouchsafed this day and this hour to allot me a portion among the number of martyrs, a∣mong the people of Christ, unto the resur∣rection of everlasting life; among whom I shall be received in thy sight, this day, as a fruitful and acceptable sacrifice, wherefore for all this, I praise thee, I bless thee, I glorify thee through the everlasting high Priest, Jesus Christ, thy well beloved

son; to whom, with thee and the holy Ghost, be all glory, world without end. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>BISHOP LATIMER, when sentence of death by fire, was pronounced against him, on ac∣count of his firmness in the cause of religion, he said, "I thank God most heartily! that he hath prolonged my life to this end; that I may, in this case glorify him by this kind of death." Fox Acts and mon. 936.</P>
<P>WILLIAM DEWSBERY, who had suffered much for his religion, in his last sickness, encouraging his friends to faithfulness, made mention, like good old Jacob, of the loving kindness of God to him in the course of his life, and that through the power of divine love, he for Christ's sake had joyfully enter∣ed prisons. See introduction to his works.</P>
<P>I MENTION these, as a few examples, out of many of the powerful operation of the spirit of Christ, where people are fully devot∣ed to it, and of the ardent longings in their minds for the spreading of his kingdom amongst mankind. Now to those, in the present age, who truly know Christ, and feel the nature of his peaceable government open∣ed in their understandings, how loud is that call wherewith we are called to faithfulness; that in following this pure light of life, <HI>we as workers together with him,</HI> may labour in that great work for which he was offered as a sacrifice on the cross; and that his peaceable doctrines may shine through us in their real har∣mony,
<PB N="29" REF="011948_0015_0F8788844948D4C0"/>
at a time when the name of Christiani∣ty is become hateful to many of the heathen.</P>
<P>WHEN Gehazi had obtained treasures, which the prophet under divine direction had refused, and was returned from the business; the prophet troubled at his conduct, queried if it was a time thus to prepare for a specious living.</P>
<P><HI>Is it a time to receive money and garments, men servants and maid servants, the leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to thee and to thy seed forever.</HI> ii. Kings, v. 26. And O that we may lay to heart the condi∣tion of the present time! and humbly follow his counsel, who alone is able to prepare the way for a true harmonious walking amongst mankind.</P>

<P>SUCH are the perfections of our heaven∣ly father, that in all the dispensations of his providence, it is our duty, <HI>in every thing, to give thanks.</HI> Though from the first settlement of this part of America, he hath not extended his judgments to the degree of famine, yet worms at times have come forth
<PB N="30" REF="011948_0016_0F87888513A294B0"/>
beyond numbring, and laid waste fields of grain and grass, where they have appeared: another kind, in great multitudes, working out of sight, in grass ground, have so eat the roots that the surface, being loosned from the soil beneath, might be taken off in great sheets.</P>
<P>These kind of devouring creatures appear∣ing seldom, and coming in such multitudes, their generation appears different from most other reptiles, and by the prophet were call'd <HI>God's army sent amongst the people.</HI> Joel ii. 25.</P>
<P>THERE have been tempests of hail, which have very much destroyed the grain where they extended. Through long drought in summer, grain in some places hath been less than half the usual quantity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When crops fail, I often feel a tender care that the case of poor tenants may be mercifully considered.</NOTE>; and in the continuance thereof, I have beheld with attention, from week to week, how dryness from the top of the earth, hath extended deeper and deeper, while the corn and plants have languished; and with reverence my mind hath been turned toward HIM, who being perfect in goodness, in wisdom and power, doeth all things right. And after long drought, when the sky hath grown dark with a collection of matter, and clouds like lakes of water hung over our heads, from whence the thirsty land hath been soaked; I have at

times, with awfulness, beheld the vehement operation of lightning, made sometimes to accompany these blessings, as a messenger from HIM who created all things, to remind us of our duty in a right use of those benefits, and give striking admonitions, that we do not misapply those gifts, in which an Al∣mighty power is exerted, in bestowing them upon us.</P>
<P>WHEN I have considered that many of our fellow creatures suffer much in some places, for want of the necessaries of life, whilst those who rule over them are too much given to luxury, and divers vanities; and behold the apparent deviation from pure wis∣dom amongst us, in the use of the outward gifts of God; those marks of famine have ap∣peared like humbling admonitions from him, that we might be instructed by gentle chas∣tisements, and might seriously consider our ways; remembring that the outward supply of life is a gift from our heavenly Father, and no more venture to use, or apply his gifts, in a way contrary to pure wisdom.</P>
<P>SHOULD we continue to reject those mer∣ciful admonitions, and use his gifts at home, contrary to the gracious design of the giver, or send them abroad in away of trade, which the spirit of truth doth not lead into; and should he whose eyes are upon all our ways, extend his chastisements so far as to reduce us to much greater distress than hath yet
<PB N="32" REF="011948_0017_0F878885C9ADE7C0"/>
been felt by these provinces; with what sorrow of heart might we meditate on that subject, <HI>Hast thou not procured this unto thy self, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way? Thine own wickedness shall cor∣rect thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee, know therefore, and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord of hosts.</HI> Jerem. ii. 17, 19.</P>
<P>MY mind hath often been affected with sorrow, in beholding a wrong application of the gifts of our heavenly Father; and those expressions concerning the defilement of the earth have been opened to my understanding, <HI>The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</HI> Gen. vi. 11. Again, Isaiah xxiv. 5. <HI>The earth also, is de∣filed under the inhabitants thereof.</HI></P>
<P>THE earth being the work of a divine power, may not as such be accounted unclean; but when violence is committed thereon, and the channel of righteousness so obstructed, that <HI>in our skirts are found the blood of the souls of poor innocents; not by a secret search, but upon all these</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a caution and warning to Great-Britain and her colonies, page 31.</NOTE>. Jerem. ii. 34.</P>
<P>WHEN blood shed unrighteously remains unattoned for, and the inhabitants are not effectually purged from it, when they do not wash their hands in innoceney, as was fi∣gured

in the law, in the case of one being found slain; but seek for gain arising from scenes of violence and oppression, here the land is polluted with blood. Deut. xxi. 6.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, when the earth is planted and tilled, and the fruits brought forth are applied to support unrighteous purposes; here the gracious design of infinite goodness, in these his gifts being perverted, the earth is defiled; and the complaint formerly uttered becomes applicable; <HI>Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins; thou hast wearied me with thine ini∣quities.</HI> Isaiah xliii. 24.</P>
