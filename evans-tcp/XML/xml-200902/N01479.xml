<P>IT is much to be desired; And how <HI>Sweet unto our Soul,</HI> would be the <HI>Desire Accomplished!</HI> That the TA∣BLE of the LORD, may be more <HI>Generally,</HI> and after the most <HI>worthy manner</HI> Approach'd unto. The <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, with His New-born Chil∣dren, like <HI>Olive-plants</HI> about it, verily, Tis an <HI>Excellent Sight.</HI> Worthy Ap∣proaches to the Table of the Lord, are <HI>Excellent Actions;</HI> and they have a Ten∣dency to make <HI>Excellent Christians.</HI> At the <HI>Table of the Lord,</HI> we do according to His Direction, Celebrate a very great <HI>Appointment</HI> and <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>New-Testament.</HI> There can be nothing more Plain and Positive, than that Order of our Saviour unto His Disciples; Luk. XXII. 19. <HI>This do in Remembrance of Me:</HI> Repeated by the Apostles of our Lord,
<PB N="4" REF="001759_0003_0FB7D255FA62F9C8"/>after He was <HI>Received up into Glory.</HI> [1 Cor. XI. 24, 25.] You need no Stronger proof, that some well known Seducers in our Days, are <HI>Lyars, and the Truth is not in them,</HI> in that they <HI>keep not,</HI> but Seduce others from keeping that In∣disputable Commandment of our <HI>Lord</HI> Jesus Christ. But, how justly does the Holy Lord, by permitting the <HI>Rising</HI> &amp; <HI>Hissing</HI> of such a Sect among them, Chastise His People, for neglecting the <HI>Ordinance</HI> which is decried and opposed by these <HI>Gainsayers!</HI> And, why, Oh! why, do so many that are far from the <HI>Heresies</HI> of that Sect, yet indulge them∣selves in the <HI>Miscarriage,</HI> which one of their most noted <HI>Heresies</HI> does lead unto!</P>
<P>Our People generally confess, That it is their <HI>Duty,</HI> to draw near unto the Lord in this Holy, and Famous Institu∣tion. And most certainly, if you did it in a <HI>Worthy manner,</HI> you would also find it unspeakably for your <HI>Interest.</HI> It would mightily confirm your <HI>Faith,</HI> yea, streng∣then your <HI>Sight,</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine of God your Saviour.</HI> It would <HI>Exercise</HI> the <HI>Gra∣ces</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001759_0004_0FB7D2588AD33D80"/>of God in your Hearts; and the <HI>Ex∣ercise</HI> would be a sensible <HI>Improvement</HI> of them. It would furnish you with <HI>Reme∣dies</HI> for all the <HI>Distempers</HI> in your Minds; your <HI>Distempered Souls</HI> would be strange∣ly relieved by the noble Medicines here dispensed unto us. It would <HI>Comfort</HI> you under your Temptations, and with <HI>Comfortable Seals</HI> thereof bring home the Everlasting <HI>Love</HI> of God unto you. It would admit you to intimate Interviews with <HI>Heaven,</HI> and advance you to <HI>Hea∣venly</HI> Satisfactions and Assurances; be a Sweet Emblem of your coming to Sit with your Saviour in His <HI>Heavenly Places.</HI> Oh! why will you Deny, to your selves, these <HI>Great Conselations of God?</HI></P>
<P>The common <HI>Apology</HI> made for this Omission is; <HI>I am afraid; I shall come Un∣worthily; and by doing so, I shall Eat and Drink Judgment unto my self.</HI> But verily, This will imply something that will hardly be capable of an <HI>Apology.</HI> Have you <HI>done,</HI> all that you <HI>can do,</HI> that you may not <HI>come Unworthily?</HI> If you have <HI>not,</HI> then you <HI>Stay away Unworthily.</HI> Tis
<PB N="6" REF="001759_0005_0FB7D2595A7EA760"/>a <HI>Sin</HI> to <HI>Come Unworthily.</HI> But, Syrs, tis a Sin to <HI>stay away Unworthily.</HI> Suppose you had that Message by an infallible Hand brought unto you; <HI>Set all things in Order, for thou hast not one Month more to Live in the World; A Month shall devour thee!</HI> What would be your Course in this case? Doubtless you would immediately Set apart a portion of <HI>Time</HI> for it;
<Q>And <HI>Confess</HI> and <HI>Bewail</HI> all your <HI>Sins,</HI> and fly to the Blood of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Saviour for the <HI>Pardon</HI> of them, &amp; earnestly de∣clare, that you Look upon <HI>every one</HI> of them, with all <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of Soul; and give up your selves unto God, with very serious <HI>Resolutions</HI> to <HI>Ac∣knowledge Him in all your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> And with unspeakable Agony beg the <HI>Spi∣rit of Grace</HI> to take Possession of you.</Q> Have you <HI>done thus?</HI> If you <HI>have</HI> done this, you may with an Encouraged Soul, come on unto the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. Tho' you are not <HI>fully Sure,</HI> of your <HI>Sincerity,</HI> yet you may come, and may <HI>Do it in Faith;</HI> Inasmuch as you have no Evidence remaining, to Pro∣clame and Pronounce a Predominant <HI>Hypocrisy:</HI> You have now no <HI>Evident
<PB N="7" REF="001759_0006_0FB7D25AD5590EB0"/>Bar</HI> to your doing of your <HI>Duty;</HI> and so you may and must go on with your <HI>Duty.</HI> But if all this be still <HI>Undone,</HI> why do you continue in such an un∣accountable <HI>Stupidity</HI> and <HI>Security!</HI> Why do you leave your Interior and Eternal State, at such desperate <HI>Uncer∣tainty?</HI> How can you bear thus to Sleep <HI>on the Top of a Mast in the Midst of the Sea?</HI> In Hourly Danger, forought you know, of a <HI>Damnation that Slumbereth not.</HI> Your <HI>First Work</HI> must be immedi∣ately to Do, what is to be done, by e∣very man, who expects to <HI>Dy,</HI> &amp; Pro∣pounds a <HI>Death</HI> without a <HI>Sting;</HI> To <HI>Lay hold on Everlasting Life,</HI> in the Me∣thods of a <HI>Repenting Faith</HI> immediately. Till This be done, you not only <HI>Live in your Sins,</HI> but also with a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Madness run the Extreme Hazard of <HI>Dying</HI> in them.</P>
<P>Sirs, The <HI>Embassadors of Peace</HI> have cause, for <HI>Weeping bitterly</HI> over you.
<Q>What? Have we been Labouring so many years, to bring our People Home unto their only Saviour; &amp; have all our pains been so ineffectual,
<PB N="8" REF="001759_0007_0FB7D25CFB1BA720"/>that not Half of our People have to this day come to those <HI>Dispositions of Piety,</HI> upon which they may venture to the Table of the Lord? Surely, <HI>We have Laboured in Vain, and Spent our Strength almost for Nought and in Vain;</HI> Or else we should see more of our People, with the Dispositions of a Regenerate Mind, accompanying of us, at the Holy Table!</Q></P>
<P>If this Consideration will make little Impression upon you, Oh! Look up to your only Saviour, and hear His Heart∣breaking Expostulations.
<Q>What? Have my People so little Regard unto the <HI>Remembrance</HI> of their <HI>Dying Saviour?</HI> Did I, when I was going to lay down My <HI>Life,</HI> on their behalf, ask them to keep <HI>Alive</HI> the Memory of what I have done for them, in a <HI>Sacramental Commemoration</HI> of it; and will they Forget My <HI>Last Will and Testament?</HI> Do I give them a Precious Opportu∣nity of <HI>Communion</HI> with Me, wherein <HI>One Hour is better than a thousand else∣where;</HI> and are they so intangled in the Lusts of this World, that they
<PB N="9" REF="001759_0008_0FB7D25DD9D42AD8"/>will not make Ready, to meet me, where I would <HI>Commune</HI> with them? Oh! Consider of it.</Q></P>
<P>But that which I should rather pro∣ceed unto, is; To Set before you, the <HI>Preparation,</HI> which you are to make, that you may not <HI>Come Unworthily</HI> unto the <HI>Table of the Lord.</HI> Having seen your selves <HI>Unable</HI> to do any thing, &amp; <HI>Unworthy</HI> that God should enable you, Lift up a cry to <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> that you may be enabled. <HI>O Thou from whom is the Preparation of the Heart in Man, Grant, Grant unto me, the Preparati∣on of thy Sanctuary!</HI></P>
<P>And now;</P>
<P>First; You are to Set before you, the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> in all the Proposals of it; and Express and Renew the Compliance of your Souls, with all that is Proposed.</P>
<P>The Demand of the Great GOD, is; <HI>Perishing Sinner, Shall I be thy God, and thy Portion? Wilt thou take me for thy Fa∣ther, thy Saviour, thy Leader? Shall it be thy chief Blessedness, to Enjoy me, and to be Employ'd for me? Art thou Willing and
<PB N="10" REF="001759_0009_0FB7D26526DA2EA8"/>Resolved, for ever to depend on my Jesus for every Good Thing and follow His Con∣duct unto the Blessedness He has purchased and Prepared for His People?</HI> Now let the Answer of your very Souls within you, be; <HI>Lord, I am Willing; Thou hast made me Willing!</HI> This 'tis to come into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God. Having <HI>Truly</HI> done this you may <HI>Safely</HI> come, &amp; <HI>Seal</HI> the <HI>Covenant;</HI> Come, and Ratify your <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Deed. This</HI> is your <HI>Business,</HI> at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. Your coming thi∣ther, must be on this very <HI>Account;</HI> it is for <HI>this</HI> that you are called unto it.</P>
<P>Secondly. You must behold a <HI>Sa∣crificed Saviour;</HI> the <HI>Lamb of God!</HI> and make a <HI>fresh Application</HI> to the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of your <HI>Saviour.</HI> Affect your selves with the view of your <HI>Sins,</HI> and of the <HI>Plagues</HI> to which you are Exposed by your <HI>Sins;</HI> and then, the Provision which God has made, in the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of your <HI>Saviour,</HI> that your Sins may be all Forgiven you. Own, you <HI>Need</HI> such a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> and Renounce all Hopes, but in <HI>That</HI> alone; and Admire the Favour of God that has provided such a <HI>Sacri∣fice</HI> for you, and allow'd you to <HI>Plead</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001759_0010_0FB7D2655E2EE208"/>it as your Atonement. Humbly Re∣monstrate; <HI>O Holy God, Thy Christ has been made a Sacrifice for my Sin. Infinite∣ly do I want such a Sacrifice. I despair of of all Help from any other. I present that most valuable Sacrifice before thee, and be∣seech thee for the sake thereof to be Recon∣ciled unto me.</HI> When you have Truly done this, you may Safely come, &amp; put in your <HI>Claim</HI> for a Part in the Great Sacrifice. This is done by coming to the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. It is to be the <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Language</HI> of your coming thither!</P>
<P>Thirdly. Tho' you may be discou∣raged by the <HI>Defects</HI> which may still attend the <HI>Work of Grace</HI> in your Souls, yet you must feel the working of Ho∣ly <HI>Desires</HI> in your Souls, to have that work effectually carried on. A <HI>Work of Grace,</HI> lies in a Principle, inclining the Soul, <Q>To Fear God, and Prize Christ, and Hate all Sin, and Sleight this World, and Do all the Good we can to all about us, and Look and Long for the Felicities of the Hea∣venly World.</Q> You must be heartily
<PB N="12" REF="001759_0011_0FB7D266D437B478"/>desirous, as to have a Real <HI>Experience</HI> of this <HI>Work,</HI> so to have it carried <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto <HI>Perfection.</HI> The <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord has been Spread, for the nourishment of this Glorious <HI>Work.</HI> The Person who is heartily <HI>Desirous,</HI> to have this Work nourished in him will be wel∣come to the <HI>Holy Table.</HI> The <HI>Good Things</HI> here, are for that <HI>Hungry</HI> and <HI>Thirsty</HI> Soul. Ah Soul above all things desirous to have the <HI>Image of God and His Christ</HI> brought unto <HI>Perfection</HI> in thee; Soul desirous to be cleansed from <HI>all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit,</HI> and brought unto <HI>Perfection of Holiness;</HI> The Great King will say, <HI>Welcome to my Ho∣ly Table; I have put a Wedding Garment on that Soul. The sense it has of its own Rags does bespeak a Wedding Garment for it.</HI></P>
<P>In these things, there lies that which we call, An <HI>Habitual Preparation</HI> for the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord. There is an <HI>Actual Preparation</HI> also to be <HI>Endeavoured.</HI> And in order to this, A <HI>Time</HI> is to be set a∣part for it, a little before your coming. You must not begrutch <HI>Time</HI> for such
<PB N="13" REF="001759_0012_0FB7D26BB712B588"/>a weighty and awful affair. Shake off your Secular Encumbrances, and com∣mand so much <HI>Time,</HI> as is requisite for the bringing of your Souls, into an <HI>Heavenly Temper.</HI></P>
<P>Now, In your <HI>Actual Preparation,</HI> One thing is to be this; You must ac∣tually go over again the Poincs of your <HI>Habitual Preparation. Actually</HI> On each of those <HI>Three Things</HI> over again; by which you will make it sure, That you have <HI>Really done</HI> them. No Proof like this; You best prove that you <HI>have done</HI> the <HI>Things that accempany Salvation,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Doing</HI> of them.</P>
<P>But then, another thing of great consequence to be now attended is, A <HI>Self-Examination.</HI> So tis required, 1 Cor. XI. 28. <HI>Let a man Examine him∣self, and so let him Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup.</HI> In the management of your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> First Implore the Help of God; <HI>Lord, Search me, Try me; see, and cause me to see, if there be a∣ny way of Wickedness in me, and let not a Deceived Heart cause me to Perish with a Eye in my Right Hand.</HI> Then take the
<PB N="14" REF="001759_0013_0FB7D26E86E03930"/><HI>Marks</HI> by which the <HI>Converts of Zion</HI> are to be distinguished; and <HI>Examine</HI> your selves, how far those <HI>Marks</HI> are to be found upon you. Put the <HI>Question</HI> to your selves, and let not your Hearts put you off, without a Satisfactory <HI>An∣swer</HI> to it.</P>
<P>Enquire;
<Q>Is a Glorious CHRIST most acceptable to me in all His <HI>Offi∣ces;</HI> and with all His <HI>Kindnesses;</HI> and would I fain have Him to be <HI>All</HI> that unto me, which He is unto all the <HI>Heirs of salvation?</HI> Do I rely on Him, as my <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and my <HI>Advo∣cate,</HI> before the Righteous God; and also my <HI>Leader</HI> in the <HI>Paths of Righte∣ousness?</HI> Do I see Him out shining all <HI>Creatures</HI> in all their <HI>Beauties;</HI> and is it the Grand wish of my Soul, to be <HI>Con∣formed</HI> unto Him? Does it unspeakably Please me to <HI>Resemble</HI> and <HI>Imitate</HI> Him, in all <HI>Vertuous Things?</HI> Yea, is it a Pleasure also unto me, to see my self in <HI>Sufferings</HI> made like unto Him?</Q></P>
<P>Enquire;
<Q>Do I Look upon <HI>Sin,</HI> as the <HI>Worst of Evils?</HI> Has the contempt
<PB N="15" REF="001759_0014_0FB7D26FEA5B9120"/>which <HI>my Sin</HI> has offered unto <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Great GOD, been the inexpressible Trouble of my Soul? Do I abhor e∣very thing, that I take to be a <HI>Sin?</HI> Am I afraid of Indulging so much as a <HI>Sinful Thought</HI> in my Mind? Have I chosen <HI>Affliction</HI> rather than <HI>Sin;</HI> when I must undergo <HI>that,</HI> for the Avoiding of <HI>Sin?</HI> And can I rejoyce in that <HI>Affliction,</HI> which I find Morti∣fies my <HI>Sin,</HI> and prevents and pre∣serves me from falling into <HI>Sin?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Enquire; <Q>Does the Infinite GOD, appear in every Thing Desirable to me; in every thing, worthy to be <HI>Lo∣ved,</HI> worthy to be <HI>Praised?</HI> Have I Placed my chief <HI>Happiness,</HI> in an <HI>Ac∣quaintance,</HI> and <HI>Fellowship</HI> with such a God; and in having His <HI>Favour;</HI> and in being used in <HI>Service</HI> for Him; and in being brought where He shall be <HI>All</HI> in <HI>All</HI> unto me? Is my <HI>Delight</HI> in those things that bring me near unto Him? And is it my Study to ad∣vance His <HI>Kingdom</HI> in the World?</Q></P>
<P>Enquire; <Q>Do I desire the Prosperity of my <HI>Neighbours?</HI> Am I glad when
<PB N="16" REF="001759_0015_0FB7D27158BF4420"/>things go <HI>well</HI> with them; Griev'd when they go <HI>Ill?</HI> Is it my Endea∣vour to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto them, who have <HI>Done Hurt</HI> unto me? And wherever I see in any of them the <HI>Piety,</HI> which intimates their being Related &amp; U∣nited unto my <HI>Saviour,</HI> does this ve∣ry sensibly Endear them to me? Do I <HI>Love</HI> them, as my <HI>Brethren;</HI> the <HI>Chil∣dren of my Father?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Enquire;
<Q>Have I Renounced the <HI>Idols,</HI> by following of which the Un∣godly are led into <HI>Perdition?</HI> Do I <HI>Deny</HI> my <HI>Flesh</HI> every thing, that God has <HI>Forbid?</HI> Am I unwilling to <HI>Offend God,</HI> that I may <HI>Get</HI> any <HI>Thing,</HI> or <HI>Please</HI> any <HI>Man,</HI> in this <HI>World?</HI> Is it my course to resist the <HI>Temptations</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> and reject them with De∣testation?</Q></P>
<P>These are the Things, after which your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> is to be Inquisi∣tive. But I make some Remarks upon the Performance of this Excercise.</P>
<P>First. Tho' you do not, upon your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> get beyond all Doubts and Fears, whether you have these
<PB N="17" REF="001759_0016_0FB7D27691F3CF58"/>things Really in you, yet you must not be by these <HI>Doubts</HI> and <HI>Fears</HI> hindred from going on, and coming to the <HI>Ta∣ble</HI> of the Lord. If you have any pre∣ponderating <HI>Hopes</HI> that you <HI>have</HI> these Things, or cannot fairly and justly Pronounce the <HI>Sentence,</HI> that you <HI>have them not;</HI> You may and should come. Come, as the Poor Woman, that came <HI>Trembling,</HI> to touch the Garment of our Saviour. Come and say, <HI>Lord, At thy Bidding I come. I durst not forbear, what thou hast bidden me to do.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. While you are in your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> to Silence your <HI>Doubts</HI> and <HI>Fears,</HI> whether you have done these things or no, the best way is, not only to <HI>Ask</HI> whether you <HI>have done</HI> such things, but now to <HI>Do them.</HI> It is now a Sweet Season to <HI>Do</HI> all that belongs to the <HI>New Creature;</HI> To <HI>Do it,</HI> over &amp; over again; The <HI>Doing</HI> of it, will render the <HI>Being</HI> of it Unquestio∣nable. Upon every Stroke say, <HI>Lord, Now I do this, if I never did it before!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. It is not only to be now Examined; <HI>Whether you have the Graces
<PB N="18" REF="001759_0017_0FB7D27A7258AC00"/>of a Regenerate Christian?</HI> But it must al∣so come into your Examination, <HI>What there is yet wanting in your Graces?</HI> You should Enquire, In what you are still <HI>Defective?</HI> And from thence Prepare some <HI>Errand,</HI> and some <HI>Request,</HI> which you will carry unto the Table of the Lord; in order to the Relief of those <HI>Defects,</HI> which are still found upon you. Sirs, The <HI>Church</HI> is an <HI>Hospital;</HI> Tis to something like the Pool of <HI>Bethesda</HI> that you are now approaching. Find out the <HI>Maladies</HI> of which you are to make your <HI>Complaint,</HI> in <HI>Expectation</HI> of here finding some <HI>Relief.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly. You cannot be insensible, That this your <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> must be accompanied with all other <HI>Devoti∣ons,</HI> that may be suitable for a Soul <HI>Pre∣paring to meet the Lord;</HI> with <HI>Contrition</HI> for Sin and <HI>Confession</HI> of it; with <HI>New Resolutions</HI> of a Better Life; with the <HI>Supplications</HI> of, One <HI>Striving to Enter into the Strait Gate;</HI> And with <HI>Reading</HI> the Word of God, and <HI>Books</HI> which may bring the <HI>Coals from the Altar</HI> to your Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="001759_0018_0FB7D27BD6D34AD0"/>
Having passed thro' this <HI>Preparation,</HI> I will now set before you, The <HI>Worthy Manner</HI> of coming unto the <HI>Table of the Lord.</HI> It shall be briefly recommended, in only Two Instructions; <HI>We will put upon you none other Burden.</HI></P>
<P>First. You must behold the <HI>Sacramen∣tal Elements,</HI> and the <HI>Sacramental Acti∣ons;</HI> and affect your Hearts with suita∣ble and Heart melting <HI>Meditations</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>When you see the <HI>Bread,</HI> your Thoughts must be on that <HI>Body which God Prepared</HI> for your Saviour, therein to make Himself a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and an <HI>Of∣fering.</HI> When you see the <HI>Wine,</HI> your Thoughts must be on that <HI>Blood of the Son of God, which cleanses from all Sin.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Taken</HI> by the Pas∣tor; and so anon, when the <HI>Wine</HI> is <HI>Ta∣ken,</HI> Your Thoughts must be on that Subject; <HI>I see, I see, how the Son of God has taken our Nature; How the Word was made Flesh!</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Blessed;</HI> Your Thoughts are to be: <HI>Thus was my Jesus Consecrated, and set apart for the Work of
<PB N="20" REF="001759_0019_0FB7D27E1C22F8F0"/>a Redeemer.</HI> And anon, when the <HI>Wine</HI> has <HI>Thanks given</HI> upon it; your Thoughts are to be: <HI>Oh! what Thanks, what Thanks do I owe for my Jesus!</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Broken;</HI> You are to think: <HI>Oh! what Griefs was my Jesus broken withal; when it pleased the Lord to bruise Him, and put Him to Griefs! And He was bruised for our Iniquities!</HI> And anon, when you see the <HI>Wine</HI> has been poured into the Cup; You are to think: <HI>Oh! how was the Blood of my Jesus poured out, when his Soul was made a Trespass-offering!</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Bread</HI> is <HI>Given;</HI> You are to think: O <HI>my God, Wilt thou give thy Jesus to me! Yea, God bath so Loved the World!</HI></P>
<P>When you <HI>Receive,</HI> the one first, and anon the other; it should be with such Thoughts as these; <HI>O my dear</HI> JESUS, <HI>I receive thee, I receive thee; No longer will I deny thee an Entrance into my Soul; at the Door whereof thou art now Knock∣ing; O my Lard, and my God!</HI></P>
<P>When you <HI>Eat</HI> the <HI>Bread,</HI> you are to Think, and wish; <HI>Oh! Let me be U∣nited
<PB N="21" REF="001759_0020_0FB7D282ADB52430"/>unto my Jesus, and Strengthened by Him.</HI> When you <HI>Drink the Wine,</HI> You are to Think, and wish; <HI>Oh! Let the Blood of my Jesus be applied unto me, as Purchasing Life Eternal for me! Oh! Let the Spirit of my Jesus Enter me, and Pos∣sess me, and Quicken me for ever-more.</HI></P>
<P>A Soul thus Engaged, is at a <HI>Feast of Fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well refined.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. You may find Intervening <HI>Spaces</HI> while you are about this <HI>Work of the Lord,</HI> for to prosecute many <HI>Special Designs</HI> of Godliness, which would here have their most Effectual Prosecution. There are Intervening <HI>Pauses,</HI> whereof tis pity a moment should be lost. Now, it were <HI>all Wisdom and Prudence in you,</HI> before your coming hither, to Shape some <HI>Holy Designs,</HI> which you will come upon. Besides what the <HI>Sermons</HI> Preached on these Occasions may Lead you to think upon; you may aforehand ponder, <HI>What remarkable Deficiency in my Christianity should I now seek to have repaired?</HI> Or, <HI>What is the Distemper in my Soul, that I will now go to the Lord
<PB N="22" REF="001759_0021_0FB7D28412182420"/>my Healer, for the Healing of?</HI> Or, <HI>What is the Temptation, with which I am now most in Danger to find the Temp∣ter too hard for me?</HI> At the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, Look upon your Saviour, as first <HI>Purchasing</HI> that Favour of God, which you are now pursuing of. De∣clare that you <HI>Receive</HI> what is before you, as a Yoken, that you <HI>Rely</HI> upon Him for that Favour. Then Look up∣on your Saviour as on the Throne at the Right Hand of God, Able and Willing from thence to dispense it un∣to you. So go on expressing the Reli∣ance of your Soul upon Him, for that <HI>Favour</HI> in all the parts of it; Say, all that you would have; until you can conclude, <HI>Lord, All my Desire is before thee, and my Groaning is not hid from thee.</HI></P>
<P>A TESTIMONY, <HI>address'd unto the People of</HI> New-England, <HI>from a Number of their Associated Pastors; Convened at</HI> Dedham, 4 <HI>d.</HI> III <HI>m.</HI> 1714.</P>
<P>FOrasmuch as by the Suggestions of the <HI>En∣vious Enemy</HI> of Mankind, (Whose Design is to prevent Men of the Enjoyment of the Spi∣ritual Influences &amp; Blessings especially Obtain∣able at the <HI>Holy Supper of the LORD</HI>) very many
<PB N="23" REF="001759_0022_0FB7D28B10993CB0"/>of the <HI>Children of the Covenant</HI> do <HI>contentedly Perse∣vere</HI> in a most Scandalous &amp; Criminal Neglect of that Holy Ordinance; most absurdly Justi∣fying their Delinquency therein by an Allega∣tion of their <HI>Unfitness</HI> and <HI>Unpreparedness</HI> for it, which <HI>itself</HI> is an <HI>heinous Iniquity:</HI> And foras∣much as by this Means the Spiritual &amp; Eternal Estates of Men are under no small Disadvan∣tages; &amp; the visible Covenant-People of GOD dreadfully exposed unto <HI>Unchurching &amp; Discove∣nanting</HI> Dispensations, under the Provoked Wrath of Heaven: Therefore we cannot but be Sensible, that 'tis our Duty to do all that we can (by the Help of our LORD JESUS CHRIST) for the Remedy &amp; Redress of this great Evil; And we do hereby most Solemnly bear our <HI>Te∣stimony</HI> against it; it being Diametrically Oppo∣site to the required Glorifying of <HI>God's Name,</HI> &amp; Advancement of His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> &amp; doing of His <HI>Will,</HI> which, (as our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> has Taught us) Men must have most at Heart on Earth, if they intend for <HI>Heaven.</HI> And forasmuch as, our Reverend and Worthy Brother, (whose <HI>Praise is in the Gospel throughout the Churches,</HI>) has, (according to the Wisdom given him of GOD) formed a Discourse, Intituled, <HI>A Monitor for Communicants,</HI> (which upon our Perusal this Day, we find, not only to be very Solid &amp; Or∣thodox, but also judiciously Adapted to the Re∣moval of the Objection above-mentioned, of Mens <HI>Unfitness for the Table of the LORD:</HI>) we cannot but think that the general Spreading of it thro' the Land, might be, (by the blessing of CHRIST) not a little Conducive to the Putting
<PB N="24" REF="001759_0023_0FB7D28C53B4C108"/>forward the desired Reformation of the afore∣said Neglect of the LORDS SUPPER. And we do earnestly Exhort all, (in the Bowels of Christ) into whose Hands the said Discourse may come, to Subject their Consciences and their whole Souls unto the Holy Word of GOD, and Will of CHRIST therein presented unto 'em; and in the Name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, We solemnly Charge such of Our People as are guilty of the Scandalous Neglect of the Sacred Supper of the LORD, to Endeavour to Repent and Reform, as they will Answer it to their Great Judge at the <HI>Last Day.</HI></P>
<P>Now, May the Precious Blood of CHRIST be Sprinkled upon them, and the Pardoning Mercy of our Heavenly FATHER be Dis∣pensed to them, and the Verticordious In∣fluences of the Eternal SPIRIT be vouch∣safed to their Souls, for their Salvation! And may That Choice Discourse be Bles∣sed to 'em for their Spiritual Good! <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
