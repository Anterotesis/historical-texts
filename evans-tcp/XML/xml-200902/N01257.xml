<HEAD>To my Vertuous and Honour'd FRIENDS the GENTLEWOMEN of <HI>Boston,</HI> Who have desir'd the Publishing of this SERMON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I DESIRE</HI> thankfully to Acknowledge the <HI>Favour</HI> of GOD to Me, in the kind <HI>Acceptance</HI> which this plain &amp; faithful <HI>Discourse</HI> has found with You; Praying Him to <HI>bless</HI> it indeed for much Spiritual and Everlasting Ad∣vantage to Your Selves and Others: that it may help to excite You unto, and assist you in such an Exemplary holy <HI>Conduct,</HI> as may be your present Comfort &amp; Honour, and may end at last in Your Eternal Peace &amp; Glory.</P>
<P><HI>I MUST</HI> confess that the <HI>Singularity</HI> and <HI>Nicety</HI> of the <HI>Subject,</HI> as well as its <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Dignity,</HI> gave me no little fears and <HI>Check</HI> in determining my Tho'ts there-unto; but I now the more readily Publish them, because Treatises of this Nature seem <HI>wanting</HI> among us.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="001497_0004_0FB37FE335B90958"/><HI>IT</HI> is a good Sign to see People pleas'd with the particular Direction of the Word to themselves, either in way of Doctrine, Re∣proof, Excitation or Warning: it gives Hopes that they will set themselves to <HI>Practice,</HI> which is the Crown and End of <HI>Hearing.</HI> Yet neither is it always thus; Practice does not alwayes follow Conviction &amp; Delight; As the <HI>Prophet</HI> was to <HI>Israel, a very lovely Song of One that had a plea∣sant Voice, and cou'd play well on an In∣strument; they show'd much love, they heard his Words, but they did 'em not.</HI> It is the Practice of these Truths that must Adorn &amp; Save You, render you Amiable and Heavenly, like the <HI>Kings Dau'ter, all Glo∣rious within.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IT</HI> must be confess'd to the Great Honour, of Your <HI>SEX,</HI> that more of the Life &amp; Power of Religion is with You, than with <HI>Us.</HI> When I have sometimes contemplated this, I have tho't that as it may be partly owing, under the Soverain Pleasure &amp; Election of GOD, to a natural <HI>Ten∣derness</HI> of Spirit &amp; Your <HI>Retiredness</HI> from the Cares &amp; Snares of the World; so more especially to Your <HI>Multiplied Sorrows,</HI> the Curse pronounc'd upon our first Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> turn'd into the greatest Blessing to Your Souls. Your frequent Returns in Your own Apprehension towards the <HI>Gates of Death,</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="001497_0005_0FB37FE4CA2B9788"/>
by which We all receive our <HI>Life,</HI> suitably lead You to a returning serious Tho'tfulness for your Souls and of Your Spiritual State; and that in a more sedate calm manner, &amp; with longer Continuance, (for divers Months together) and so with better Effect ordinarily, than Fits of Sickness are wont to have upon us; which do more surprise, &amp; terrify for the time, but are usually soon over and their Impressions vanish.</P>
<P><HI>A PECULIAR</HI> Regard is due to You, and indeed ever had, in the <HI>Labours</HI> of Your <HI>Pastors;</HI> among which I bring my <HI>Offering;</HI> for my <HI>Ability</HI> where-unto I freely confess my Self <HI>Indebted,</HI> after the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> to the Wise Conduct, De∣portment, and Religious Discourses, which with no little Admiration I have observ'd sometimes Habi∣tual to divers of our <HI>Gracious Mothers.</HI> So that I here return You but <HI>Your Own,</HI> what some of Your Selves have supply'd me with, and taught me. 'Tis a Pleasant way of <HI>Learning,</HI> and thus Good People do often Instruct their <HI>Teachers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I AM</HI> Sensible of the <HI>Advantage</HI> which the <HI>Discourse</HI> receives, from Your Reverence to the Me∣mory of that <HI>Excellent PERSON,</HI> Whose Death is the sad Occasion of it. The <HI>Town</HI> justly Mourns the Awful, Sudden &amp; repeated Breaches made in that <HI>Honourable Family:</HI> While at the same time, It is comforted in its Expectations from the <HI>Surviving BRANCHES,</HI> and in the Disposal which Providence has made of <HI>the Estate</HI> into such Hands, from Whom the <HI>Publick</HI> Promises it Self so good a Use of it.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="001497_0006_0FB37FE7354D7260"/><HI>INDEED,</HI> as Providence order'd it, which de∣termineth our Habitations, Mrs. <HI>Foster</HI> had the Early &amp; First Reverence of my Childhood; Her <HI>Multiply'd Bereavments</HI> &amp; <HI>Yearly returning Sorrows</HI> than making deep Impressions on the Nei'bourhood, whilst Her Exemplary Resignations greatly Edify'd it. Those dayes of <HI>Mourning</HI> have been since follow'd with a long Uninterupted Lease of <HI>Prosperity.</HI> So GOD often prepares Persons for their Temporal Comforts by many previous Trials; which is both a gracious Care to preserve them Humble and Mortify'd in their Affluence, and also a present Reward, as <HI>Job</HI> had, for past Patience.</P>
<P><HI>TO CONCLUDE,</HI> The <HI>Example</HI> is indeed very <HI>Great</HI> &amp; Worthy of Singular Remark, to the Glory of the Power of Divine Grace, when Persons are Preserved <HI>Humble, Grave, Devout, Boun∣tiful in the midst of Insnaring Riches:</HI> their <HI>Prayers</HI> and their <HI>Alms</HI> going up before GOD, yea remaining also with Men, for a lasting <HI>MEMORIAL.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LET THOSE</HI> that have Riches be Exhorted to an Emulous Imitation: And may the Grace and Consolations of GOD abound to our Aged, and the same Blessed Spirit of Holiness and Com∣fort be poured out on Younger Persons; Which is the Earnest Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>The DUTY and HONOUR OF <HI>Aged Women,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>TITUS. II. 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Aged Women likewise, that <HI>they be</HI> in Behaviour as becometh Holiness.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOLOMON tells us, that the <HI>Hoary Head is a Crown of Glory</HI> if it be found in the <HI>way of Righteousness.</HI> A <HI>double Honour</HI> has GOD put on that <HI>Venerable Head,</HI> and a double <HI>Reverence</HI> is due there-unto from all Be∣holders: the <HI>Ornament of Grace</HI> Superadded to the last and highest <HI>beauty of Nature;</HI> and so the nearest Approach on Earth to that <HI>Vision</HI> of the <HI>Son of Man,</HI> Who is also the <HI>Ancient of Dayes</HI> &amp; Father of Eternity, Rev. i. 14. <HI>His Head and his Hairs white
<PB N="2" REF="001497_0008_0FB37FEB69FCA458"/>
like wooll, as white as snow.</HI> HE, the <HI>Eter∣nal Purity</HI> and Holiness sometimes <HI>gildes</HI> the Grey Head with a beam and Raye of His own Glory, and the white hairs shine as the light; like some thread of the trans∣figur'd SAVIOURS Raiment, or a lock of <HI>Moses</HI> descending from the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>
<P>EVEN <HI>Nature</HI> teaches, what the <HI>Law</HI> of old so strictly enjoyned, Lev. xix. 32. <HI>To rise up before the hoary head, and to honour the face of the Old Man.</HI> But <HI>Grace</HI> teaches us to pay this Act of Reverence with dou∣ble love &amp; pleasure, where we can see a∣ny advanc'd in Holiness as well as Years, <HI>full of Grace as well as Dayes.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY now and then we see some of these beauteous <HI>Old Monuments of Time and free Grace</HI> taken down, or rather taken up from our heads like <HI>Elijahs,</HI> worn out with labours and fastings, or consum'd with Zeal; while Others of either <HI>Sex</HI> are waiting in the Temple, like <HI>Simeon</HI> &amp; <HI>Anna</HI> for their happy dismission also. They are <HI>waiting</HI> for the full <HI>Consolations</HI> in CHRIST; by the SPIRIT they come into the <HI>Temple;</HI> they embrace their <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> in the <HI>Arms</HI> of faith; they <HI>Speak</HI> of
<PB N="3" REF="001497_0009_0FB37FECD1642218"/>
Him to all that are <HI>Looking for Redemption,</HI> they Serve GOD with <HI>Fastings and Pray∣ers night and day,</HI> and are ready to Sing their <HI>Nunc dimittis, Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN Honour unto <HI>Such,</HI> both <HI>Living</HI> &amp; lately <HI>deceas'd,</HI> I have presum'd to fix at this time on these <HI>Words; The Aged Wo∣men also that they be in Behaviour as be∣cometh Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>TITUS was the Superior <HI>Pastor</HI> or <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Crete,</HI> left there by the <HI>Apostle,</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> to set in order the <HI>Churches.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> writes him here a very Solemn Charge and Directory; <Q><HI>Canons</HI> for the Church very sufficient, if men wou'd but <HI>Swear</HI> and pay a strict <HI>Canonical Obedience.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN this <HI>Chapter</HI> he is directed what to <HI>Speak</HI> and Preach; In General, <HI>Sound Doctrine;</HI> i. e. Wholesome, Solid, Substan∣tial, and necessary Truths, which contribute to the Souls health &amp; nourishment. Par∣ticularly, He is directed to teach <HI>Aged People,</HI> both Men &amp; Women, their Duty. The <HI>Aged Men,</HI> v. 1. <HI>that</HI> they <HI>be Sober, Grave, Temperate, Sound in Faith, in Cha∣rity,
<PB N="4" REF="001497_0010_0FB37FEE648EDF18"/>
in Patience.</HI> These are the great Or∣naments of <HI>Old Age,</HI> and greatly requisite for the Comfort, Honour and Safety of it.</P>
<P>NONE are exempt from the Instructions and Admonitions of the <HI>Word. Ministers</HI> must Preach to both Old &amp; Young. <HI>GOD</HI>'s <HI>School</HI> is (as <HI>One</HI> sayes) not only for the Initiating of the Youth, but also for the Edifying the Aged.</P>
<P>NOR is the <HI>Sex</HI> any Exemption from the Exhortations of the Word. We must up∣on occasion Preach to Women their pecu∣liar Duties. <HI>Timothy</HI> is bid to <HI>entreat the Elder Women as Mothers, &amp; the Younger as Sisters with all Purity.</HI> And so <HI>Titus</HI> must do <HI>likewise, — The Aged Women, that they be in Behaviour,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT will not therefore seem <HI>Indecent,</HI> nor I hope be Unacceptable, that I now be∣speak the <HI>Mothers in Israel,</HI> for their Di∣rection, Excitation, and Comfort in the holy Wayes of GOD. Let <HI>Them</HI> accept this <HI>Duty</HI> from the <HI>least of their Sons.</HI> I hope it looks respectful and reverential, while I use this <HI>Authority</HI> given us of GOD. And let Us all in Tho't and Word both, take heed to observe a strict Purity.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001497_0011_0FB382FA4EDB2960"/>THE Occasion of my present Address to You is obvious. Several Aged Women, and some of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mrs</HI> Foster, <HI>Mrs.</HI> Webster, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Eminence</HI> have lately gone from us. Let those who thro' Grace Sur∣vive, take heed to their <HI>Behaviour,</HI> that it be <HI>as becometh Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT is the <HI>Honour</HI> which the <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> from the Beginning does unto <HI>Good Women.</HI> The <HI>Records</HI> of their <HI>Graces</HI> and Devotions are Many and Eminent: Their <HI>Services</HI> to the Church and Interests of Religion signal and Illustrious: Their <HI>Zeal,</HI> Faith, Purity, Charity, Patience bright and conspicuous: Their <HI>Courage</HI> and Constancy at the <HI>Cross</HI> of Christ and at His <HI>Grave,</HI> out-did the very chiefest A∣postles: And peculiar were the <HI>Regards</HI> and Honours wherewith our LORD re∣warded their Piety &amp; Fidelity. Wherever he saw their <HI>Behaviour</HI> to be <HI>as became His Holiness,</HI> they were lovely in his Eyes, and dear to his Soul. HE accepted the Mi∣nistrations of <HI>Martha,</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Luk x. 41.</NOTE> but more the devout Attention of <HI>Mary;</HI> the flowing Penitence too of the <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">vii 38.</NOTE> <HI>fair Sinner</HI> at his

feet; <HI>She</HI> washt 'em with her <HI>Tears,</HI> nor did He forbid her to touch 'em, nor spurn'd her away. How graciously did He seek out the <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Joh. iv. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Samaritan</HI> at the <HI>Well,</HI> to wash her polluted Soul from the <HI>Spring of living Water,</HI> his Spirit and holy Breath! How did He Praise and Magnify the <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Luk. viii 47. Mat. xv. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Poor Womens Faith,</HI> who lay trembling at His feet! And how tenderly did He bespeak the <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Luk. xxiii. 27, 28.29.</NOTE> <HI>Weeping Dau'ters</HI> who follow'd Him to his Cross, while He disdain'd a look or a word to the impious <HI>Rout</HI> that hal'd Him along to it with Scoffs &amp; Flouts! And <HI>finally,</HI> when He was risen from the dead, as the holy Women were first at the <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Mat xx<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iii. 1, 2. Joh. xx 14, 15</NOTE> <HI>Sepulcher,</HI> so first he <HI>appear'd</HI> to them.</P>
<P>I WILL not proceed to Speak of the Mi∣nistrations of Holy Women to <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles;</HI> the Honours that <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xvii, 2 Kings iv.</NOTE> <HI>Elijah</HI> &amp; <HI>Elisha</HI> did 'em, and the Rank or <HI>Order</HI> which many suppose they even held in the <HI>Primitive Church;</HI> tho' the <HI>Learned</HI> know well how great a Current of <HI>Expositors</HI> in∣terpret my <HI>Text</HI> to this very sense, Scil,

the <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Deaconesses</HI> who therein Ministred.</P>
<P>TO return: The <HI>Text</HI> is not a Rule pe∣culiar only to <HI>Women,</HI> nor appropriate to the <HI>Aged; Men</HI> need the Exhortation at least as much, if not more, and <HI>Younger Women</HI> more than their Mothers. But as the Divine Providence leads me, &amp; my <HI>Text</HI> more especially confines me to the <HI>Aged Handmaids</HI> of the LORD; so eminently it is their Duty and Honour that they be in Behaviour as becometh Holiness.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Behaviour:</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> word is singu∣lar: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: of large sense, and well translated by the most general word, <HI>Be∣haviour.</HI> The whole outward deportment and carriage; the whole Life and all the Actions of it; Every thing that appertains to our Publick Appearance &amp; Conversation; Garb, Dress, Gate, Countenance, Speech, Silence, Gesture, in the <HI>Habit</HI> of them all, do fall under this <HI>Copious</HI> word, <HI>Behaviour.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCT.</HI> That it is Eminently the Duty and the Honour of Aged Women, that they be in Behaviour as becometh Holiness.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001497_0014_0FB38300D0090AA0"/>IN Speaking to these words, I shall first enquire more in General,</P>
<P N="1">I. What is that Christian Behaviour in∣cumbent on <HI>Us all,</HI> &amp; becoming Holiness?</P>
<P N="2">II. What peculiarly is becoming <HI>Women</HI> professing Holiness?</P>
<P N="3">III. What more Eminently becometh Holiness in <HI>Aged Women?</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Why are <HI>They</HI> Eminently obliged to such Behaviour?</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT <HI>is that Christian Behaviour in General which becometh Holiness?</HI> It is a <HI>Law</HI> to us all, Phil. i. 27. <HI>Only let your Con∣versation be as becometh the Gospel of Christ.</HI> The Gospel is the Rule of Holiness to us, in the holy Doctrines, Laws, Examples, and Motives of it. From these we may easily gather what the Behaviour is that becometh Holiness.</P>
<P>IT must be such as <HI>becomes the Holy Doctrines</HI> of Christianity: the Being and Holiness of GOD; the nature of Sin, the Redemption from it, the Mediation of CHRIST, the Covenant of Grace, the Im∣mortality of the Soul, the Eternal Judg∣ment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now what kind of Behaviour do these Doctrines imply to be pleasing to
<PB N="9" REF="001497_0015_0FB38301CF0B45C8"/>
GOD, honourary to Him, and necessary to our being for Ever blessed in Him? <HI>Truth</HI> like the Light, is both to Irradiate and Purify: 1 Pet. i. 22. <HI>Ye have Purifyed your souls in Obeying the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, Our Behaviour must be such as the <HI>Holy Laws</HI> of the Gospel do require. What is written there? <HI>how readest thou?</HI> So live and <HI>do;</HI> and thy Behaviour will be as becometh Holiness.</P>
<P>SO likewise, if it becomes the holy and <HI>glorious Example,</HI> which our <HI>Lord Je∣sus Christ</HI> has given us in his blessed Life. For here-unto are we called, to walk even as He walked, to be as He was in the World, to follow His Steps, who was Ho∣ly, harmless, undefiled, separate from Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat xi 29 1 Pet ii. 21. 1 Joh ii 6. Heb vii. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, Our Behaviour must be such as becomes the blessed <HI>Promises</HI> and holy <HI>Motives</HI> of the Gospel: the glorious <HI>Hopes</HI> which it wou'd beget us to: the di∣rect Influence whereof is <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor vii. 1. 2 Pet i. 4. 1 Joh iii 3.</NOTE> to put us upon Purifying our selves as GOD is Pure; to
<PB N="10" REF="001497_0016_0FB38305AF5AC998"/>
be cleansing our selves from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holiness in the fear of the LORD; and that by <HI>them</HI> we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature, having escap'd the Corruption that is in the World thro' Lust.</P>
<P>TO conclude, Our Behaviour must be such as becomes the <HI>fair Profession</HI> which we make, the <HI>Vows</HI> that we are bro't under, the <HI>Means</HI> and long <HI>Day</HI> of Grace which we enjoy. We must adorn our Profession, and walk worthy of the Vocation where∣with we are called, and consider what manner of Persons we ought to be, in all holy Conversation and Godliness under our peculiar Advantages &amp; Bonds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus ii. 10. Eph iv. 1. 2 Pet. iii. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS is the Behaviour that we profess, and which Christianity calls for and binds unto, as the <HI>genuine fruit</HI> of Internal Holi∣ness, and the only sufficient <HI>Test</HI> of it. By these holy Doctrines, Laws and Motives; by this Profession, bond and means of Ho∣liness, we must order our selves; Our looks, words, actions, garb, deportment; our friendships, visits, discourses and relative
<PB N="11" REF="001497_0017_0FB383070EA9EFD0"/>
Obligations; our eating and drinking▪ our business and dealings; our civil Mirth, recreations and diversions; at Home and Abroad; and then is <HI>our Behaviour such as becometh Holiness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. MORE particularly let us Enquire, <HI>What is the Behaviour becoming Holiness in Christian Women?</HI> There is that which is peculiarly obliging, decent and orna∣mental to them. As <HI>Nature,</HI> and <HI>Custom,</HI> the publick judgment of Nature and Na∣tions; so also the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> do com∣mand and commend to them, an Eminence in Modesty, reserve, purity, temperance, humility, truth, meekness, patience, cour∣tesie, affability, charity, goodness, mercy, compassion: Discretion, prudence, Piety and Devotion, guarding, influencing, and shining brightly forth in all.</P>
<P>IT is Your <HI>great Honour,</HI> that more is expected in your Behaviour, of all that is <HI>nicely</HI> Vertuous and Exemplary. How do we <HI>distinguish</HI> You by expecting of You, that whatsoever things are honest &amp; just, pure and lovely, of good report and praise,
<PB N="12" REF="001497_0018_0FB383094EAFB460"/>
that you do excel in all these things!</P>
<P>THE things that do not become Holi∣ness, or that are contrary there-unto, are doubly dishonourable &amp; guilty in You, by the Estimation of the World: for <HI>Instance,</HI> Lightness in Behaviour, sensual lusts, wan∣tonness and impurity, boldness and rude∣ness, in Look, Word or Gesture; drink∣ing, profaneness, malice, railing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How <HI>Odious</HI> are these things justly held in <HI>Wo∣men!</HI> More <HI>Scandalous,</HI> tho' not more <HI>Guilt</HI> before GOD, than in <HI>Men!</HI> Save as there may be the greater <HI>Rape</HI> committed on the Conscience of <HI>Decency,</HI> and the Reluctance of native <HI>Shame;</HI> strengthned by a vertu∣ous <HI>Education,</HI> and the Admonitions of the <HI>Holy Word.</HI></P>
<P>NOR is the <HI>Weakness of Sex</HI> any Indul∣gence really (whatever some may think or grant) for any Vanities of Apparel, pride, impotent Envies, Censoriousness, talkativeness, gadding, backbytings, or the like Evils; which look yet meaner &amp; viler in <HI>Men</HI> than in <HI>Women,</HI> and so seem an Ex∣ception from the <HI>Rule</HI> before laid down: for all <HI>these</HI> too do leave a <HI>Stain</HI> and dis∣honour
<PB N="13" REF="001497_0019_0FB3830B77A54510"/>
on the Persons that can <HI>Stoop</HI> to 'em, tho' there be not a <HI>Prostitution</HI> to things of grosser Turpitude.</P>
<P>LET Christian <HI>Women</HI> read from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Context.</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Pet. iii. 1, 2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> the Exemplary Behaviour, which is expected from them: Scil, <Q>That they adorn themselves in modest Apparel, with shamefac'dness &amp; sobriety; not with broider'd hair, or gold or pearls, or costly Arraye; (not affecting, nor ex∣cessive in, bodily Ornaments) but which becometh Women professing Godliness, with good Works: Not usurping autho∣rity, but learning in silence, with all sub∣jection: Continuing in faith, in charity, and holiness. Their Conversation is re∣quir'd to be chast, coupled with fear; their Adorning the hidden Man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, e∣ven the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of GOD of great price: for after this manner in old time, the Holy Women also who trusted in GOD adorned themselves.</Q> <HI>Finally,</HI> In our <HI>Context</HI> They are warn'd &amp; exhor∣ted,
<PB N="14" REF="001497_0020_0FB3830C4FC53758"/>
<Q>Not to be false Accusers, nor given to much wine; But to be sober, discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, tender, faithful &amp; affectionate in their domestick Relations; that the Word of GOD be not blasphemed.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is that <HI>Behaviour</HI> which the HO∣LY GHOST has prescribed unto <HI>Women</HI> as becoming Holiness in them. <Q>The <HI>Price</HI> of this <HI>rare Person</HI> is, as <HI>Solomon</HI> says above Rubies, She does every one Good and not Evil all the days of her life. She's diligent, charitable &amp; beneficent. She stretcheth out her hands to the poor, she reacheth forth her Arms to the needy.

<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="001497_0021_0FB3830DCF496038"/>III. I PASS now to the <HI>Third Enquiry,</HI> which is, <HI>What is more Eminently becoming Holiness in the Aged, and particularly in Aged Women? What is peculiarly requisite in their Behaviour?</HI></P>
<P>I ANSWER, 1. All that has been alrea∣dy said is to be supposed in <HI>Them</HI> in a <HI>Su∣perior degree,</HI> so as to be <HI>Examples &amp; Pat∣terns,</HI> teaching and <HI>living Rules,</HI> shining in all Gravity, Wisdom &amp; Heavenliness; that their Presence &amp; Words may always com∣mand Veneration, Awe &amp; respectful Atten∣tion from their <HI>Juniors,</HI> and powerfully commend the Wayes of Religion and Ver∣tue to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. MORE especially, <HI>the Aged should excel in the Spirit of Devotion, &amp; lead by their good Example in a devout, reverent &amp; early Attendance on the Publick Worship of GOD.</HI> As <HI>Myriam</HI> &amp; <HI>Deborah</HI> led the <HI>Dau'ters of Israel</HI> in the Praises of GOD: or as Aged <HI>Anna</HI> departed not from the <HI>Temple.</HI> In∣deed there are no greater <HI>Ornaments</HI> in our Congregations for Worship, than the <HI>gra∣cious Faces</HI> and deportment of such religi∣ous
<PB N="16" REF="001497_0022_0FB3830FC24538F8"/>
<HI>Matrons;</HI> to whom under the Influen∣ces of the HOLY SPIRIT the Beauty &amp; Solemnity of our <HI>Assemblies</HI> is not a little owing, and the Spirit of Devotion <HI>Propa∣gated</HI> to the rising Generations. But here our <HI>Defects</HI> oblige me to say more parti∣cularly,</P>
<P>THAT it is highly becoming Holiness in the <HI>Aged,</HI> that they let their <HI>Dau'ters</HI> see them at the <HI>Table of Christ,</HI> walking like <HI>Elizabeth in all the Commandments &amp; Ordi∣nances of the LORD blameless.</HI> What a Miss-behaviour, and unseemly thing is it, to see grave aged Persons leaving the House of GOD when <HI>that holy Ordinance</HI> comes on! judging themselves <HI>not yet</HI> meet for that holy Approach with the Faithful un∣to Christ! or confessing their Neglects of Preparation therefor <HI>unto this Day!</HI> And if they have been of grave &amp; laudable De∣portment before their <HI>Children</HI> &amp; Houshold, what a <HI>Stumbling</HI> is it to them! an <HI>Excuse</HI> for <HI>their</HI> staying away, esteem'd sufficient by too many! and too often an effectual <HI>Bar</HI> to them who are inclin'd to come! their <HI>Reverence</HI> to their Elders (surely one
<PB N="17" REF="001497_0023_0FB38310CEAC8BC8"/>
of the worst <HI>Abuses</HI> that ever was of a thing so good, or of anothers good life) restrain∣ing them from this plain piece of Duty and Obedience to GOD.</P>
<P>BUT besides these <HI>Publick Devotions</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> a high Spirit of Devotion shou'd govern the Aged in their <HI>more private Con∣versation;</HI> in their <HI>Families</HI> &amp; occasionally among their <HI>Friends.</HI> They shou'd let their <HI>Housholds</HI> see that they neglect not their <HI>Closets;</HI> tho' what passes there let be <HI>Secret</HI> with GOD. <HI>Religious Discourse</HI> must next Adorn the Aged Lips, and Edify the Fami∣ly and Visitors. The many <HI>Mercies of a past Life</HI> may suitably be often call'd to Mind; the <HI>Snares</HI> of an evil World warn'd against; the need and good of <HI>Afflictions</HI> be thankfully remembred; and <HI>Alsufficient Grace</HI> be frequently admir'd &amp; ador'd that carries the Children of GOD so well thro' <HI>them,</HI> &amp; Legions of worse but more <HI>smiling Temptations.</HI> The <HI>Aged Believer</HI> will be often looking back; <HI>now</HI> making his <HI>aba∣sing Reflections</HI> on an unprofitable Life past, (how <HI>little</HI> done for GOD, how little fruit bro't forth, how much <HI>time</HI> &amp; <HI>cost</HI> in effect lost, and how full of Sin:) <HI>then</HI> with a
<PB N="18" REF="001497_0024_0FB3831336189648"/>
<HI>brighter tho't</HI> and face Adoring the Grace that has been so long magnify'd to so un∣worthy a Creature: the <HI>Grace</HI> that has waited on him unto all Long-suffering! that has so freely succour'd, strengthen'd, preserv'd supply'd him hitherto! that has pity'd, pardon'd, restor'd him, and will fi∣nally Save him. The <HI>Aged</HI> in their pious and devout Reflections, shou'd be frequent∣ly leaving their Testimony behind them, with those that are rising after them in their places, of the Goodness of the wayes of Religion, whereof they have made a happy Experiment; and of the Faithfulness of GOD to them in all the Providences that have pass'd over them. Let 'em declare what GOD has done for their Souls, how <HI>Pleasant</HI> the wayes of Wisdom have been found by them, and what <HI>Peace</HI> in the End of those <HI>Paths. They</HI> may also say what they have <HI>Seen of Others,</HI> both the Righte∣ous and the Wicked: that they have been Young and now are Old, yet have they not seen the <HI>Righteous forsaken,</HI> nor his <HI>Seed;</HI> that on the other hand, they have seen the <HI>Wicked taking root,</HI> and spreading himself like a green Bay-tree, yet he passed
<PB N="19" REF="001497_0025_0FB383148EC1C178"/>
away and lo he was not; they have sought him and he cou'd not be found. From a full Conviction <HI>they</HI> may amply declaim on the <HI>vanity of this World,</HI> the Poverty of a Portion in it, and the Emptiness of those flattering Temptations, which so easily be∣guile &amp; bewitch us: <HI>Few &amp; Evil,</HI> at the best and longest, do they find the <HI>days of the years of their Pilgrimage.</HI> Finally, <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI> shou'd be the familiar subject of Aged Persons discourse. A <HI>natural</HI> En∣tertainment <HI>for</HI> them, and <HI>from</HI> them, who are so near <HI>it.</HI> The proper Effect of a dai∣ly <HI>Preparation,</HI> and the good Symptom of actual <HI>readiness.</HI></P>
<P>TO close this Head, Let me from the excellent Words of the <HI>Psalmist</HI> show the Aged, what the Devotional Reflections, Acknowledgments, Supplications and Re∣solutions are, which become them: Psalm. lxxi. 5.—14,—18. <HI>Thou art my Hope, O Lord GOD, thou art my Trust from my Youth. By thee have I been holden up from the Womb; Thou art He that took me out of my Mothers Bowels; my Praise shall be continually of thee. —Cast me not off in the time of Old Age, for∣sake me not when my Strength faileth.—But
<PB N="20" REF="001497_0026_0FB383178F57AC60"/>
I will hope continually, &amp; will yet Praise thee more &amp; more. My Mouth shall shew forth thy Righteousness, and thy Salvation all the day: for I know not the Numbers thereof. I will go in the Strength of the Lord GOD, I will make mention of thy Righteousness, even of thine only. O GOD, thou hast taught me from my Youth, and hitherto have I declar'd thy wondrous Works: Now also when I am old &amp; grey-headed, O GOD, forsake me not!</HI> Thus shou'd the Aged excel in the Spirit of high Devotion: to which <HI>Head</HI> I might also reduce this which follows,</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is highly becoming Holiness in Aged Persons, <HI>that they take all Occasions fitting, Privately to instruct, counsel, admo∣nish, countenance &amp; encourage Younger Peo∣ple, especially their Families, in the wayes of GOD.</HI> Their <HI>Years</HI> give 'em Authority, their <HI>Experiences</HI> may greatly accomplish them, their Wisdom and <HI>Discretion</HI> will di∣rect and <HI>Preserve</HI> them therein. <HI>I said, Dayes shou'd Speak, and Multitude of Years shou'd teach Wisdom:</HI> Scil, to Younger Peo∣ple, like <HI>my self,</HI> said wise <HI>Elihu</HI> before his <HI>Fathers.

Job. xii. 12. And one Eminent <HI>Use</HI> of it is to advise the Younger of small Experience.</P>
<P>THEREFORE sayes our <HI>Context,</HI> Let the Aged Women <HI>be Teachers of good things.</HI> Scil, let <HI>'em teach the Young Women, to be Sober, to love their Husbands, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, Obedient,</HI> &amp;c. Aged People shou'd in their respective Pla∣ces so far imitate the <HI>Apostle, Paul the Aged,</HI> as to be able to say of their <HI>Families,</HI> as he did to the <HI>Churches:</HI> 1 Thes. ii. 11, 12. <HI>As ye know how we Exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of You, as a Father doth his Children, that ye would walk worthy of God, who has called you unto his Kingdom &amp; Glory.</HI> Let the Aged be imparting Libe∣rally their Prayers, Blessings, Reproofs, and Spiritual Experiences among their Off∣spring: As long as they are in <HI>this Taber∣nacle,</HI> let 'em stir up those that are rising af∣ter 'em; knowing that they must <HI>shortly put it off,</HI> and that their time of Usefulness is just at its End. This is truly <HI>becoming Holiness</HI> in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. GRAVITY <HI>in Garb &amp; Deportment is highly becoming Holiness in Aged Women.</HI> It is a great <HI>Missbehaviour,</HI> and unbecoming
<PB N="22" REF="001497_0028_0FB3831A8EB9BEB0"/>
<HI>Age,</HI> to <HI>affect Youth;</HI> or indulge in it self the <HI>Modes, Liberties</HI> and Customs lawful and decent in Youth. Even the <HI>World</HI> wont allow this, and less will <HI>Religion.</HI> It brings a Persons <HI>Prudence,</HI> even where it does not her <HI>Grace</HI> into question. It les∣sens the <HI>Character,</HI> where it does not lose it. Gravity to the Aged shou'd be like Mo∣desty to the Young, never to be forfeited or trespass'd on. The <HI>Air</HI> of Youth in Age is a <HI>Cloud</HI> &amp; <HI>Slur,</HI> even where there is much Wisdom and many Graces, bright Devotion and many Excellencies conspicu∣ous. It is a <HI>Blemish,</HI> makes a <HI>but</HI> in the Character, and lessens Esteem. GOD and Nature never meant these <HI>Extremes of Life</HI> to meet: that it should be a <HI>Circle</HI> and at <HI>Seventy</HI> years the round shou'd be begun a∣gain. A Saint in Age shou'd show a Soul above the Vanities of this Life and the Pleasures of Sense, yea a Mind <HI>Mortify'd</HI> to them. As old <HI>Barzillai</HI> excus'd himself to his <HI>Prince,</HI> that his <HI>Age</HI> forbad him the pleasures of the <HI>Court:</HI> let young <HI>Chim∣ham</HI> take 'em, said he, <HI>for how long have I to live? let me return to the Grave of my Father.</HI> 2 Sam. xix. 34. One wou'd not
<PB N="23" REF="001497_0029_0FB3831C0EA920C8"/>
<HI>dress Airily,</HI> nor trip with levity, to one's <HI>Grave:</HI> No, but look toward it and meet it with all possible Gravity &amp; Awfulness. Elder People shou'd rather Wear their <HI>gray hairs</HI> as their <HI>Ornament,</HI> and (if I might say so) make 'em their <HI>Pride;</HI> for as <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> truly sayes, Prov. xx. 29. <HI>The Glory of Young Men is their strength, and the Beauty of the Old Man is the gray head.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THAT Aged Women may be in Be∣haviour as becometh Holiness, they <HI>must take heed to bear with Decency the Evils and Troubles that are Incident to Old Age, and strictly watch against the peculiar Infirmities &amp; Temptations, the common Dishonours of it.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Evils and Troubles</HI> are partly from <HI>within,</HI> as weaknesses, ails, pains, and distempers of various kinds under the decay of Nature; or, which are more try∣ing, from <HI>without,</HI> — neglects, disesteem, Insignificancy; or, which are yet worse, Ingratitude, Undutifulness, and Wrongs. To bear all these with temper, wisdom and resignation, from the views of another World, is <HI>noble Fortitude,</HI> Divine Faith, and heavenly Greatness of Spirit. <Q>The height of Passive Glory, <HI>as</HI> One <HI>calls it.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="001497_0030_0FB3831E0DAC36B0"/>TO this Exemplary Resignation and <HI>Trust</HI> in GOD,— to this Superiority over the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>dearest &amp; most obliged things in it,</HI> the <HI>desolate</HI> aged <HI>Widow</HI> is of∣ten called: And we sometimes see 'em <HI>act</HI> this last &amp; most difficult <HI>part</HI> of Life in a truly Divine &amp; <HI>Heroick</HI> manner: too Great and Wise <HI>to seem to see</HI> what they bitterly suffer; and only thereby driven the more to GOD, in Whom they may safely trust; and to Whom they may freely Weep and Pray. SHE is the Primitive <HI>Widow indeed: desolate she trusteth in GOD, and continueth in Supplications and Prayers night &amp; day.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 5.</P>
<P>BUT then again, there are <HI>the Peculiar Infirmities, and common Dishonours</HI> of old Age, which must be <HI>strictly watcht against.</HI> Such are discontent &amp; frowardness, seve∣rity and censoriousness; together with a contempt &amp; disdain, if not Envy, of the Advantages or Worth of Younger Persons: and <HI>finally,</HI> which one wou'd least suspect, Covetousness, anxious cares, and fears for to Morrow; <HI>distrust of Providence as well as Relatives.</HI> These are some of the Sins and <HI>Guilts</HI> of Age; they are contrary to the
<PB N="25" REF="001497_0031_0FB383206D46FCF8"/>
Spirit of <HI>Holiness.</HI> These <HI>Errors</HI> blemish your <HI>own</HI> Name, and dishonour <HI>Christs;</HI> they break your Peace, your Communion, your Walk with God; and so unfit You for the Meeting of Death with that comfort and calm which you shou'd desire and aim at. Therefore,</P>
<P>LET Aged People watch against <HI>Pe∣vishness</HI> of Spirit, and a readiness to <HI>Sus∣pect</HI> their friends of Unkindness and want of respect. Watch against a <HI>Timorous</HI> Spi∣rit &amp; distrust of Providence; fear of <HI>Want,</HI> and the natural Consequent thereof, <HI>Cove∣teousness.</HI> Let 'em watch against <HI>Severity</HI> and <HI>Censoriousness;</HI> a too <HI>rigid</HI> Expectati∣on from their Youngers, or too severe Judgments of their <HI>Innocent</HI> Liberties. Look not for your own <HI>grey hairs,</HI> on their <HI>green heads.</HI></P>
<P>WATCH also against the Evil Spirit of <HI>Envying</HI> those that are rising, their <HI>Gifts,</HI> their <HI>Applauses,</HI> and their time of <HI>Action &amp; Use;</HI> for every <HI>Generation</HI> will find some of their <HI>Own</HI> to magnifye, and to be serv'd by; nor can Grace endure that they be <HI>des∣pis'd &amp; crusht</HI> meerly because <HI>Juniors</HI> in Years; when often they Promise not to
<PB N="26" REF="001497_0032_0FB383214EA6E678"/>
be so either in Wisdom or Grace, if GOD spare 'em to be old, &amp; they keep with <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P>THESE, and such-like <HI>Temptations of Age,</HI> the advanced Believer must watch a∣gainst, if he wou'd be <HI>in Behaviour as be∣cometh Holiness.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. AND <HI>lastly,</HI> It is highly becoming Holiness in <HI>Aged Women,</HI> to see them of <HI>a Beneficent, compassionate, condescending, ob∣liging Spirit to their Poorer Nei'bours, es∣pecially in Sicknesses and under any Troubles. Then</HI> courteously to visit, assist, serve and help: to <HI>Wash the Saints feet</HI> if need were, and to be ready unto every Good Work. Much of <HI>Pure Religion and Undefiled before GOD,</HI> have we often seen in the Exemplary Humility, Courtesie, Charity, which gra∣cious <HI>Matrons</HI> of a Superior Rank, have readily shown in their <HI>Visits</HI> of this nature to their Nei'bours in their Affliction. Their <HI>leisure</HI> time is thus fill'd up with do∣ing Good: their Age is no time of <HI>Idle∣ness,</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">— Senes ut in Otia tuta recedant. <HI>Hor. Serm.</HI> Sat. Prim.</NOTE>. Their Knowledge and <HI>Experience</HI> is thus profitably communicated, both for the relief &amp; help of Soul &amp; Body, as oc∣casion offers. Their friendly Countenance
<PB N="27" REF="001497_0033_0FB38322CEE00390"/>
and <HI>Sympathies</HI> are relieving to the Af∣flicted, to whom pity shou'd be shown: But more the distribution of their <HI>Alms</HI> to∣gether with their courteous Words, if they are <HI>Rich</HI> and have where-with to <HI>give.</HI></P>
<P>TO say the truth; We scarce ever see the <HI>Apostles</HI> PRECEPTS to the <HI>Romans</HI> more brightly <HI>Exemplifyed,</HI> than in some of our <HI>Grave &amp; Good Mothers:</HI> Scil, <Q><HI>Love without dissimulation;</HI> the being kindly Affectioned; in Honour preferring o∣thers; shewing Mercy with chearfulness: Abhorring that which is evil; cleaving to that which is Good; fervent in Spirit, Patient in Tribulation, instant in Prayer: distributing to the necessity of <HI>Saints,</HI> given to Hospitality, rejoycing with them that rejoyce, and weeping with them that weep: not minding high things, but condescending to them of low degree. <HI>Rom.</HI> xii 9,—16.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is a glorious fruit of <HI>Age</HI> and growth <HI>in Grace.</HI> A <HI>Life</HI> worthy to be <HI>Prolonged,</HI> or even to be <HI>Restor'd,</HI> if it pleas'd GOD, like that of <HI>Tabitha</HI>'s: who was such a <HI>Woman, full of good Works &amp; Alms-deeds which she did;</HI> whom when she was
<PB N="28" REF="001497_0034_0FB383245BCE6498"/>
dead — how did her Nei'bours <HI>Praise</HI> and bless! and the needy <HI>Widows,</HI> whom she had reliev'd, <HI>stood weeping over her!</HI> but GOD at the Prayer of <HI>Peter</HI> gave them back the <HI>Blessing</HI> which they had Mourn'd themselves bereav'd of: <HI>He called the Saints and Widows and presented Her alive! Act.</HI> ix. 41.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Short;</HI> This beneficent Spirit (to use the Words of an Excellent <HI>Author</HI>) will make a Woman a <Q><HI>Mother to many when she ceases to bear,</HI> and tho' she no more <HI>increases one</HI> Family, she <HI>supports many.</HI></Q> Never may we write her <HI>Barren,</HI> who is so <HI>fruitful</HI> in good works! the <HI>Orphans</HI> are her Children, and their <HI>Loins</HI> bless her! in <HI>These— Sing O barren! thou that didst ne∣ver bear!</HI> GOD's Grace &amp; Spirit in thee is better than <HI>ten Sons.</HI> <Q>Certainly, the <HI>fertility</HI> of the <HI>Womb</HI> is not so valuable as this of the <HI>Bowels. Fruitfulness</HI> can be but a <HI>Happiness, Compassion</HI> is a <HI>Vertue.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THUS I have endeavour'd to show something of that <HI>Behaviour</HI> which becom∣eth Holiness in <HI>Aged</HI> People; more espe∣cially in aged <HI>Women.</HI> The last <HI>Enquiry</HI> is,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="29" REF="001497_0035_0FB38325D1363C18"/>IV. WHY <HI>are They Eminently obliged to be of such Behaviour?</HI></P>
<P>I ANSWER, 1. <HI>Because Improvement &amp; Excellence may well be expected in Age.</HI> The Aged have had time for Growth, &amp; a <HI>long</HI> day of Grace under <HI>Means</HI> &amp; Advan∣tages. Suffer me also to suppose of them, that they were wro't upon in their Younger dayes by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD, and that they are grown Old in the Service of <HI>Christ.</HI> More has been <HI>done</HI> for them than for O∣thers, more <HI>Pains</HI> taken with them, more have been their <HI>Opportunities;</HI> and in some proportion now more shou'd be the ripe fruits of Holiness brought forth by 'em, <HI>meet for the Hand</HI> that has so long manur'd, dress'd &amp; tender'd them. While we look on your <HI>hoary heads,</HI> we must needs sup∣pose and say, <HI>Behold,</HI> they <HI>are white already to the Harvest.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. BECAUSE <HI>of the Influence of Their Example.</HI> They give a <HI>Judgment for Vice</HI> or Vanity upon Experience, if they are vicious, light or frothy. Younger People are apt eno' to learn Evil of 'em, and they invite them to do so. <HI>Children</HI> are very
<PB N="30" REF="001497_0036_0FB383285E28D340"/>
<HI>nice Observers</HI> of the <HI>Liberties</HI> which their <HI>Parents</HI> &amp; <HI>Superiors</HI> give themselves, and prone to <HI>Imitate:</HI> Especially from the <HI>de∣fects</HI> of those whom they <HI>reverence</HI> as Peo∣ple of Vertue &amp; Religion, to take a <HI>Licence,</HI> and justify themselves therein. For, would so grave &amp; gracious &amp; strict a <HI>Person</HI> do so, say <HI>they,</HI> if there were any Evil in it?</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Temptations of the World are past with the Aged,</HI> &amp; therefore Holy Beha∣viour may be expected more especially of <HI>them.</HI> Shall they Sin on <HI>Stupidly</HI> without Temptation? and <HI>dream</HI> on in the wayes of Sin &amp; Sense without <HI>Enjoyment,</HI> without <HI>Tast,</HI> and <HI>desire failing?</HI> The World can no longer flatter them with its Promises &amp; <HI>Prospects</HI> of Pleasures, Profits &amp; <HI>Glories,</HI> as when they were Younger. Their blood is chill'd in their <HI>Veins,</HI> their <HI>Senses</HI> &amp; Re∣lishes decay'd. <HI>Can I discern between</HI> (Sensitive) <HI>good &amp; evil?</HI> said Aged <HI>Bar∣zillai, Can thy Servant tast what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the Voice of Singing men and Singing women?</HI></P>
<P>SENSUAL <HI>lusts,</HI> the <HI>flames of Youth,</HI> are quencht by the <HI>Ice of Age,</HI> or gone out for want of <HI>Ezel.</HI> In the Involuntary Mor∣tification
<PB N="31" REF="001497_0037_0FB3832990C23110"/>
of these, <HI>Nature</HI> may seem at last not only to cease its Reluctance against, but to come in to the Assistance of <HI>Grace.</HI> And now what manner of Exemplary Be∣haviour may we not expect from such, who are thus advanc'd by Years above the fatal Temptations of Youth and middle Age, <HI>the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life!</HI> who are <HI>past</HI> the World and its <HI>Snares</HI> by the very Testimony of their <HI>Senses.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. ELDER <HI>People are so near their End, so soon to dye,</HI> and to <HI>give up their great Account,</HI> that surely they above any shou'd be very careful about their Behaviour. Waiting for their <HI>Lord,</HI> getting into actual Readiness for their Summons hence; <HI>wise and wakeful,</HI> and <HI>trimming their Lamps.</HI> The <HI>Certainty</HI> of their near approach to <HI>Death,</HI> shou'd quicken them to more than ordinary Caution, Watchfulness and Dili∣gence. To <HI>be</HI> every day, as they wou'd have Death find &amp; not <HI>Surprise</HI> 'em. This was <HI>Barzillai</HI>'s Guard &amp; Motive; <HI>How long have I to live—?</HI> and what at <HI>this Age</HI> have I to do but to be Meditating my de∣scent to the <HI>Grave of my Father?</HI> let me <HI>retire</HI> then and spend the few remaining
<PB N="32" REF="001497_0038_0FB3832BA7453CE8"/>
dayes in the most fixt Preparations for a <HI>better World.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. ELDER <HI>People</HI> shou'd Eminently be in behaviour as becometh Holiness, as much as may be <HI>to repair the Omissions, de∣fects &amp; transgressions of a past Life.</HI> These are too many, and sad to reflect on, even where there has been the greater Circum∣spection, Industry and Labours. And the most <HI>faithful</HI> Servant will most sensibly confess his great Unprofitableness. The <HI>loss of past time</HI> and Opportunities lies <HI>heavy</HI> on a gracious heart. <HI>Omissions</HI> are a grie∣vous <HI>Article</HI> of guilt, in a gracious Saints <HI>Accompts.</HI> And his <HI>Inference</HI> is, <HI>Then</HI> let me redeem &amp; improve the few dayes to come, with so much the more Zeal! let me lose no more of this short Life! let me fill up the poor Remains with more and better Works! <HI>Knowing the Time, that now it is high-time, to awake out of Sleep.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. AND <HI>lastly, Elder</HI> People should Emi∣mently <HI>&amp;c. Because it is the way to arm themselves against the Disadvantages &amp; In∣firmities of Age, &amp; the natural Fears of Death.</HI></P>
<P>HOLINESS is the best defence &amp; pro∣tection of <HI>Age,</HI> under its natural Weak∣nesses,
<PB N="33" REF="001497_0039_0FB3832C8F195F28"/>
and Inevitable decayes. It carries People above <HI>Expectations</HI> from this World, and raises 'em in the desires and <HI>Hopes</HI> of a better. It Enables them to resign any further <HI>Pretensions</HI> here below, and with a <HI>Nobleness</HI> of Soul to leave these Inferior things to Others. It fortifies un∣to, and exercises it self in <HI>Patience</HI> before GOD, as to all present <HI>Trials.</HI> It claims and even <HI>forces Reverence</HI> from others, and <HI>covers a Multitude of faults</HI> to which Age is incident. It is <HI>Elijahs Mantle</HI> cast over his <HI>Passions,</HI> and the <HI>Translation</HI> of the <HI>Saint</HI> is expected and attended with the utmost Honours.</P>
<P>BUT then as to <HI>Death's Terrors</HI> no∣thing tends to prevent &amp; take away these like this <HI>Holy Behaviour. Blessed are those Servants whom the LORD when He cometh shall find so doing! and if He come in the second Watch, or come in the third Watch and find them so, Blessed are those Servants.</HI> Luk. xii. 38. Like <HI>Old Aaron</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Numb xx 26.</NOTE> <HI>unclothing</HI> himself in the <HI>Mount,</HI> there to <HI>die;</HI> so may we hope that the Aged waiting Be∣liever may be willing to be <HI>Unclothed:</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="001497_0040_0FB3832E0EC65558"/>
Or like the <HI>Apostle</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 6. 2 Cor. v. 2. Phil i. 23.</NOTE> <HI>ready to be Offer'd, groaning earnestly to be clothed upon, and having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</HI></P>
<P>IT now remains to make some brief IMPROVEMENT, and it shall be in these <HI>three</HI> USES.</P>
<P N="1">I. TO Admonish &amp; Awaken the <HI>Wick∣ed</HI> in Age.</P>
<P N="2">II. TO Quicken and Encourage Aged <HI>Saints</HI> in the Wayes of <HI>Holiness.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. TO Exhort <HI>Younger</HI> People to the <HI>Reverence</HI> of Aged Saints, and to <HI>Imitate</HI> them in all <HI>holy Behaviour</HI> betimes.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>first</HI> USE may be, <HI>to admonish and awaken the Wicked in Age.</HI> Whoever they be that are <HI>Old and Graceless,</HI> Old and <HI>Vicious.</HI></P>
<P>ENTREATING <HI>You as Fathers,</HI> yet let me lay before you the <HI>Rebukes</HI> of GOD. If <HI>Holiness</HI> be so becoming the <HI>Aged,</HI> then how Unseemly, how Aggravated, how Dangerous is your <HI>State of Sin?</HI> With what <HI>Blushes,</HI> with what <HI>Tears</HI> shou'd I
<PB N="35" REF="001497_0041_0FB3832F8F225038"/>
bespeak you, or <HI>You hear</HI> what has been already said? With what <HI>fear and trem∣bling</HI> shou'd you look <HI>back</HI> on a Life of Sin, not yet begun to be repented of? And with what <HI>Horror</HI> shou'd you look <HI>forward</HI> into a Miserable <HI>Eternity,</HI> if you die in this State? And yet every <HI>Night</HI> may you look that <HI>your Soul may be re∣quired!</HI></P>
<P>SURELY You shou'd <HI>Instantly</HI> bewail your <HI>long Aggravated Habits</HI> of Sin, and Contempts of the Gospel; and seek ear∣nestly to CHRIST, if you may be re∣newed once at length unto Repentance! if possibly you may be forgiven! if <HI>yet</HI> free Grace may be magnify'd toward You!</P>
<P>AH! What a <HI>Curse</HI> to ones <HI>Self,</HI> and what a <HI>Woe</HI> to the <HI>World,</HI> is a Life ad∣vanc'd in Vice, and spent in Ungodliness! <HI>The Sinner an hundred years Old is</HI> but the more <HI>Accursed.</HI> Isa. lxv. 20. The <HI>Re∣flections</HI> of this Person must needs be very bitter, and his <HI>Prospect</HI> before him pro∣portionably sad. His <HI>Bones</HI> are full of the Sins of his Youth, and his <HI>Conscience</HI> of the remembrance of their dire Guilts.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="001497_0042_0FB383310F55E358"/>WHAT a <HI>grim Face</HI> will <HI>Death</HI> have to Morrow to the old Impenitent Sinner! It <HI>Stares</HI> dreadfully upon him that is never so Young, but what <HI>Flames</HI> are in its Eyes as it seises the Aged, in Sin! What <HI>Legions</HI> of Guilts committed from the dayes of Youth &amp; upward, will come in Arraye! the <HI>black Guard</HI> and Train that attends the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> in that <HI>Execution!</HI> How many <HI>more,</HI> and much <HI>sorer lashes</HI> of Conscience, suppose ye, must he undergo, who from his Child∣hood has been <HI>trampling</HI> the Gospel, the <HI>Blood</HI> of CHRIST with His Authority under foot! <HI>Alwayes resisting,</HI> grieving, quenching, and doing <HI>despite</HI> to the SPI∣RIT <HI>of Grace!</HI> Had he dy'd thus in Youth he had been <HI>chastis'd</HI> with cruel <HI>whips,</HI> but now with what <HI>Scorpions!</HI></P>
<P>O THEN, <HI>My Fathers,</HI> Let me <HI>beseech you in the Bowels of Christ</HI> to bethink your selves as You are going off the <HI>Stage,</HI> of your wretched fearful <HI>State.</HI> If Death shou'd Serve its <HI>Arrest</HI> on you to day, where wou'd you be? What wou'd be∣come of your precious Souls? and whi∣ther wou'd you goe? <HI>Ask</HI> your selves—.
<PB N="37" REF="001497_0043_0FB38332D0729628"/>
Has your <HI>Behaviour</HI> been, or is it thro' Grace <HI>as becometh Holiness?</HI> And if not—, Can you hope to <HI>See GOD?</HI> Or can you bear to be rejected, Accursed of Him? With what <HI>Sorrow</HI> must you <HI>ly down</HI> at last, no <HI>new Birth</HI> having past upon you! How will you <HI>rise to Judgment</HI> with these <HI>Complicated</HI> Guilts upon you! Shou'd you <HI>go on</HI> in Sin with these <HI>trembling Knees!</HI> stooping, crouching, and at last sinking under the loads of Guilt! What a <HI>Shame</HI> are vicious Inclination, Inconsideration, and supine Forgetfulness of your Souls at your Years! And how Astonishing is the <HI>Hazard</HI> you stagger on in! Yet at last <HI>Remember, seek and submit to your long for∣gotten Saviour, and his Alsufficient Grace.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I must <HI>take leave; lost</HI> in this <HI>Maze</HI> of Misery, and willing to <HI>pass out</HI> of it, to a <HI>Second</HI> USE, more comfortable and pleasant; which is,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO <HI>Quicken and Encourage</HI> Aged Saints <HI>in the Wayes of</HI> Holiness. O how Becoming, how good and pleasant is it to see you here! to see your Devotion, to sit at your feet and hear your Wisdom!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="001497_0044_0FB3833658F2CB88"/>YOU do not Live <HI>Useless</HI> now you're Old: You do not <HI>cumber</HI> the Earth: No, but are its <HI>Ornaments and Blessing.</HI> You are the <HI>Salt,</HI> you are the <HI>Light</HI> of the World: without You it wou'd be <HI>Unsa∣voury</HI> and full of <HI>darkness.</HI></P>
<P>WE bless GOD, who has shown such Grace to Men! that any live to <HI>adorn the Doctrines of CHRIST</HI> to this length and degree. It is like that <HI>Infinite Bounty</HI> and gracious Care for our World, which has plac'd <HI>so many Bodies and Stars of light</HI> in the visible <HI>Heavens,</HI> that from Genera∣tion to Generation it may be <HI>Enlightned</HI> by their <HI>Beams,</HI> warm'd cherisht and <HI>En∣richt</HI> by their <HI>Influences.</HI></P>
<P>IF You are <HI>Old in Grace,</HI> then GOD has greatly Glorify'd Himself in and from You: the <HI>Power</HI> of his Grace, and the <HI>Riches</HI> of his Mercies have been <HI>Magnify'd</HI> toward You: the Immutability, Freeness and Sufficiency thereof. You have liv'd to the <HI>Edification</HI> of others: been Bene∣fiting the World, by your Example, Pray∣ers, Services &amp; good Works. The Good of your own <HI>Souls</HI> has been all the while abundantly consulted &amp; promoted: You
<PB N="39" REF="001497_0045_0FB383394F16C718"/>
have made rich Advances, we hope, and grown <HI>Strong</HI> in the Grace of the <HI>Lord Je∣sus.</HI> You may <HI>know more</HI> (its likely) than many of <HI>your Teachers</HI> of a life of <HI>Communion</HI> with GOD: and be arriv'd to some happy Measures of <HI>Assurance. Great</HI> also is your <HI>Reward</HI> in Heaven, after a <HI>long Service</HI> to your <HI>Saviour</HI> here on Earth: Not having been <HI>Weary</HI> of well doing, in <HI>due Season</HI> you shall <HI>Reap;</HI> and that not <HI>Sparingly,</HI> if you <HI>sow Plentifully.</HI> If you have been <HI>recover'd late</HI> from a Course of Sin, the more have you to admire, with deep abasement, of the <HI>Exceeding Power</HI> and riches of Soverain Mercy; and the more be quickned to the further working out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>BE <HI>Exhorted</HI> to hold on and <HI>Persevere</HI> in Holy Living; <HI>trusting</HI> in and casting your self upon that free Grace, which You have already so much Experienc'd. <HI>Pray</HI> for and <HI>Bless</HI> the <HI>Generations</HI> rising after You. <HI>Impart</HI> Your Spiritual Experien∣ces, Charges and Counsels among them. <HI>Freely You have received, freely Give.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="001497_0046_0FB3833AD1A401A8"/>AS to Your <HI>Selves,</HI>—Be neither weary of Life, nor <HI>afraid to die:</HI> but Live ex∣pecting your <HI>Change,</HI> and believe in GOD to carry You well thro' it. GOD has done for You more Already, than all that remains to be done, in order to Your hap∣py passing the <HI>Gulf</HI> of death. <HI>He</HI> that has kept You in Life, and shown You Grace; will not now at last <HI>leave</HI> You in Death. His <HI>Rod</HI> and his <HI>Staff</HI> have comforted You thus long, and what <HI>Evil</HI> can you now <HI>fear?</HI> will <HI>these</HI> be remov'd (think you) just as you are entring the <HI>Shadow</HI> of death? <HI>O thou of little Faith, wherefore dost thou doubt!</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude this <HI>Exhortation:</HI> Be thankful for Life, resigned as to Death, and let the <HI>last part</HI> be best <HI>Acted,</HI> if it may be; that You may pass off the <HI>Stage</HI> with Decency and Honour. As Nature grows past Worldly and <HI>Secular Action,</HI> remember You are the more at Liberty for, and call'd off unto, the Exercises of the <HI>Spiritual Life.</HI> As Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> exhorts the Aged, — <HI>"Cleave</HI> closer than Ever to <HI>Christ,</HI> being presently to be cast upon
<PB N="41" REF="001497_0047_0FB3833C4ED21528"/>
Him as your <HI>Saviour,</HI> and to appear be∣fore Him as Your <HI>Judge.</HI> As the Body <HI>withers,</HI> let your Souls <HI>retire</HI> to <HI>Him,</HI> as the <HI>Root</HI> of your Spiritual Life, which is <HI>hid with Christ in God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. LET the last USE be of Di∣rection and Exhortation to <HI>Younger People,</HI> to <HI>Reverence Holiness in their Elders,</HI> and to <HI>Imitate them therein betimes.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. HONOUR <HI>their Persons with double honour:</HI> paying both the <HI>Respect</HI> which is due to their <HI>Age,</HI> and also the <HI>Veneration</HI> due to the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD crowning them in it. <HI>Internal Esteem</HI> and Love, together with <HI>External</HI> respects, are due to them whom GOD has so <HI>Enobled</HI> in their Souls and dignify'd. Even <HI>Pharaoh</HI> paid a Re∣verence unto <HI>Jacobs</HI> venerable Face, and receiv'd a <HI>Blessing</HI> from his lips. Much more did <HI>Joseph</HI> hastily descend from his Princely <HI>Chariot,</HI> to bow down to his feet <HI>Solomon</HI> rose from his <HI>Throne</HI> to meet and bow himself before his <HI>Royal</HI> and Gracious <HI>Mother,</HI> who had so well <HI>taught</HI> &amp; charg'd
<PB N="42" REF="001497_0048_0FB3833F5187EA40"/>
Him, after She had <HI>born</HI> Him. The Form of Aged <HI>Samuel</HI> is hence represented (no matter by <HI>whom</HI>) as the <HI>Visage</HI> of the <HI>Gods:</HI> said the <HI>Woman</HI> to <HI>Saul, I saw Gods ascending, — An Old Man and cover'd with a Mantle, — and Saul stooped with his face to the ground and bowed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. LET <HI>Young People Imitate the Holy Behaviour of the Aged betimes.</HI> This is the only sure way to be <HI>like them</HI> in Ho∣liness, if you live to be <HI>Old.</HI> Lay a good foundation: <HI>begin early:</HI> 'tis hard to change hereafter. Vice <HI>roots</HI> and fixes it self by Indulgence in Youth: Custom in Sin <HI>hardens,</HI> and Age <HI>stupefyes.</HI> If we wou'd ever be <HI>Old in Grace,</HI> it must be found in us while we are <HI>Young:</HI> for <HI>One</HI> converted in Age is but a <HI>Young Saint;</HI> old in years but <HI>New born;</HI> Born again, tis true, but <HI>out of due time.</HI></P>
<P>TO <HI>Us</HI> who are Young GOD has ex∣hibited his Grace in <HI>those</HI> that are gone or going before us, to excite us to seek it <HI>Emulously</HI> for our <HI>selves,</HI> to be our <HI>Guide</HI> and <HI>Guard</HI> thro' life, and our <HI>Crown</HI> at the
<PB N="43" REF="001497_0049_0FB38342D8AE3108"/>
end of it, as it is <HI>theirs.</HI> So live we there∣fore now, treading in their steps wherein they have follow'd <HI>Christ,</HI> that <HI>We</HI> may be (by the same Grace of GOD) to the <HI>next Generations,</HI> shou'd we live, what <HI>These</HI> are to us; Our <HI>Glory and Joy,</HI> our defence and safety, the <HI>Ornament and Mu∣nition of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>LET us <HI>retain</HI> in Mind their Excellen∣cies, and <HI>bury</HI> their Infirmities; not taking our Judgment of them from their <HI>present Decayes,</HI> but their <HI>past Use</HI> and Services, and their abiding growing Devotion.</P>
<P>LET us <HI>Pray</HI> for them, how much soever our Superiors in Gifts and Graces; and return <HI>their cries</HI> to Heaven for us, in humble Requests for their final <HI>Perseverance.</HI> Let us desire and ask the <HI>Continuance</HI> of such <HI>ancient Blessings.</HI> Let the World ne∣ver be weary of these <HI>Monuments</HI> of the Presence of GOD in it, and His <HI>Image</HI> continued on it. Let us pray to the <HI>GOD of the Spirits of all flesh,</HI> that He wou'd take of <HI>His Spirit</HI> on His <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Aarons,</HI> and put it upon many Others; that there may be a <HI>Succession</HI> of Holy Saints in the
<PB N="44" REF="001497_0050_0FB383448EB41D48"/>
Generations to come, <HI>Joshuas</HI> and <HI>Calebs</HI> in future times, to sit in <HI>Moses Seat,</HI> and <HI>Shine</HI> in his Grace. Let us even <HI>bless our Elders,</HI> and ask for them a <HI>Growth</HI> in all Goodness unto their latest hour, and the <HI>Consolations</HI> of the SPIRIT of GOD to be increased to them; that like a <HI>Taper</HI> which has seem'd long a <HI>going out,</HI> giving its un∣certain <HI>broken flashes</HI> now and then, <HI>They</HI> may in their last Moments revive, and give the brightest light of all.</P>
<P>FINALLY, When GOD <HI>takes away His Aged Saints, let those that Survive weep for themselves in their Death.</HI> Tho' they die in a <HI>good Old Age,</HI> and as <HI>Corn full ripe</HI> are gather'd into the <HI>Garner;</HI> yet our <HI>Loss</HI> is great in their Infinite <HI>Gain:</HI> the loss of their Example, and Faith, and Prayers. Isai. iii. 1, 2. <HI>For behold, the Lord, the LORD of Hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem &amp; from Judah — the</HI> PRUDENT, <HI>and the</HI> ANCIENT.</P>
<P>IT <HI>is such a Bereavment of this Town,</HI> in the <HI>Decease</HI> of the Excellent Mrs. FOSTER, whose <HI>Mourning</HI> we wear <HI>to day,</HI> that has led me to these <HI>Meditations.</HI></P>

<P>A BRIGHTER and more <HI>Amiable</HI> Pat∣tern is scarce to be found in an Age, of High Devotion, Gravity, Prudence, Hu∣mility, Courtesie, Compassion, and Bene∣ficence.</P>
<P>I SHALL by no Means attempt Her <HI>Character,</HI> but I propound Her <HI>Life</HI> to You all that knew Her, as a much better <HI>Sermon</HI> on my <HI>Text,</HI> than I am able to bring You. And how much harder and more Excellent is it to <HI>Live</HI> these <HI>Rules</HI> than to <HI>Preach 'em!</HI></P>
