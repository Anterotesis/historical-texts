<P>THE LAW given at SINAI: A POEM.</P>

<HEAD>To the reverend Dr. LANGDON, President of Harvard College.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Hon<SUP>d</SUP> Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH but little apology, and perhaps with less modesty, I here expose to your perusal a short juvenile performance, <HI>"the law given at Sinai."</HI> I offer it to you, Sir, not only as knowing your attachment to the sublime original; but because there is none to whom I so much owe this tribute of gratitude.</P>
<Q><L>"Beneath the shade of whose paternal wing,</L>
<L>"I first presum'd to touch the trembling string."</L></Q>
<P>At this leisure hour, perhaps, the mathematician is drawing his angle, and the logician his conclusion; and if the muse can catch one sprig from Parnassus, I trust it may not be rejected. Whether this little sprig be genuine, I judge not.—If I have fail'd, my excuse for offering it shall be, that altho' I should have but one talent; and that talent be ever so small, yet would I "not hide it beneath the surface of the earth."—</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With much respect, from Your pupil, the Author.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>The LAW given at SINAI: A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THro' heaven's high courts the trump eternal roars—</L>
<L>Lift up your heads ye everlasting doors;</L>
<L>And wait the GOD of Gods!—Lo, at the sound,</L>
<L>Wide fly the portals, blazing all around.</L>
<L>And see he comes! adown the rending skies,</L>
<L>Borne on the whirlwind's rapid wing he flies,</L>
<L>Cherub and seraphim prepare his way,</L>
<L>Black thunder rolls and livid lightnings play.</L>
<L>Heav'n's radiant Bow his awful head arrays,</L>
<L>His face the sun's refulgent beam displays;</L>
<L><PB REF="015282_0004_0F9882A140181410"/>Beneath his feet th' avenging bolts are hurl'd,</L>
<L>Th' avenging bolts that shake a guilty world.—</L>
<L>Sounds but his dread command when down they fly,</L>
<L>The deep-mouth'd thunder rends the vaulted sky;</L>
<L>All nature trembles as they issue down,</L>
<L>Deep groans the earth, her utmost regions groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And lo on Sinai's top descends the GOD,</L>
<L>That wrapt in tempest, trembled as he trod.</L>
<L>Flame, smoak, and whirlwind cloath it's awful brow,</L>
<L>While Earthquake heaves the groaning base below.</L>
<L>Tremendous scene, oh how shall men withstand,</L>
<L>When GOD in thunder gives the world command!</L>
<L>And hark! the trumpet's intermitted sound</L>
<L>Roars from the mount and shakes all nature round.</L>
<L>I am the King of Kings, the Lord of all,</L>
<L>At whose dread shrine ev'n Gods in honor fall:</L>
<L>By whom creation rose, divinely fair,</L>
<L>Who form'd the stars, and launch'd them in the air:</L>
<L>Whose mighty nod the rough tumultuous sea,</L>
<L>The whirlwind's Sweep, and rending bolt obey.</L>
<L><PB REF="015282_0005_0F9882A1FACB8F38"/>I speak—and lo ten thousand thunders roll—</L>
<L>I breath—and lightning gleams from pole to pole.</L>
<L>Th' Almighty is my name—at my command</L>
<L>Thick darkness rose that veil'd the Memphian land.</L>
<L>Empower'd by me, your leader smote the main,</L>
<L>And call'd up plagues that poison'd all their plain;</L>
<L>That ev'n the earth and air, which gave them birth,</L>
<L>Conspir'd and smote them with enormous death.—</L>
<L>I spake the word, asunder Jordan rode,</L>
<L>That Israel o'er it's dry foundations trod.—</L>
<L>Egypt pursu'd, I bade the same dread wave</L>
<L>Roll back, and whelm their millions in a grave.</L>
<L>'Twas said—the raging elements combin'd,</L>
<L>The rushing tempest and the warring wind;</L>
<L>'Till own'd too late a God's superior pow'r,</L>
<L>They sunk in depths, and sunk to rise no more!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still wou'd ye have the assistance of that GOD</L>
<L>Continu'd thro' a life's perplexing road;</L>
<L>That when at last the heavens and earth expire,</L>
<L>And nature rolls in one devouring fire,</L>
<L><PB REF="015282_0006_0F9882A2BAD0EE38"/>Ye might in transport view th' advancing hour.</L>
<L>In transport hear the last dread thunders roar;</L>
<L>Then like the day emerging from the gloom,</L>
<L>Arise to flourish in eternal bloom—</L>
<L>With due respect, with holy awe receive</L>
<L>Those institutions which your God will give!—</L>
<L>For this he trod th' unhallow'd realms below,</L>
<L>In all the pomp the pow'rs of heaven could show.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No other GOD beside me shall ye own;</L>
<L>Nor brazen deity nor featur'd stone.</L>
<L>An awe more holy suits the King of heaven;</L>
<L>A name too sacred to be vainly given!</L>
<L>Th' advantage your's, but render God his due—</L>
<L>His deeds revere, his day of resting too:</L>
<L>That glorious day when all my works were done,</L>
<L>Worlds launch'd in air and light coelestial shone:</L>
<L>When all creation rising from the shade,</L>
<L>Her adamantine basis had been laid.</L>
<L>A work how vast!—full worthy to receive</L>
<L>Eternal reverence from the sons of Eve.—</L>
<L><PB REF="015282_0007_0F9882A37B8C2BD0"/>Your parents honor, and an awe be paid</L>
<L>To sage experience and the hoary head:</L>
<L>Then full of days, in hoary peace ye'll die,</L>
<L>With blessings crown'd and ripen'd for the sky.</L>
<L>And this observe—your hands withhold from blood,</L>
<L>Nor stain with gore the image of your God;</L>
<L>And this—to foul adult'ry ne'er be given—</L>
<L>A deed that hates the purest laws of heaven!</L>
<L>Rob not your neighbour, blush the wretch to lead</L>
<L>Thro' alien fields to beg his scanty bread.—</L>
<L>O covet not—his little portion save;</L>
<L>And be contented with what heaven gave.</L>
<L>Nor ah—the tongue, that curious work of God,</L>
<L>Abuse to cast his infamy abroad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus spake the Legislator of the sky—</L>
<L>And earth's long shores return the loud reply.</L>
<L>Peal push'd on peal, the doubling thunders roar,</L>
<L>Bellow the winds—the flamy lightnings glare—</L>
<L>Fear in a thousand forms the camp assails,</L>
<L>Nothing but shrieks and groans and death prevails.</L>
<L><PB REF="015282_0008_0F9882A43B8939E8"/>Short-sighted wretches that the storm behold,</L>
<L>And all the terrors that his throne infold;</L>
<L>But think not that its base on mercy lies,</L>
<L>Tho' all around it clouds eternal rise!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such shall the scene be at that dreadful time,</L>
<L>When the last trump shall sound his wrath sublime:</L>
<L>That potent trump which every head shall call</L>
<L>From each dark chamber of the bursting ball.</L>
<L>Then at the flames which in his nostrils glow,</L>
<L>The everlasting hills in streams shall flow—</L>
<L>Th' affrighted sun shall from yon arch retire,</L>
<L>Shook from his sphere, and help the gen'ral fire.—</L>
<L>Yon moon in blood! then every star shall fall,</L>
<L>In rude combustion o'er a flaming ball:</L>
<L>Creation sunk, and all God's thunder hurl'd</L>
<L>Down on the wrecks of each expiring world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But where's the muse?—behold the Almighty rise:</L>
<L>The whirlwind bears him up the flaming skies.</L>
<L><PB REF="015282_0009_0F9882A4FACBD970"/>Follow harmonious all the tuneful choir,</L>
<L>Sweet concert sweeping from the swelling lyre.</L>
<L>Such notes as at creation's birth they sung,</L>
<L>When heaven's broad arch with hallelujahs rung.</L>
<L>Hark—at the strain th' enraptur'd spheres rebound▪</L>
<L>And labouring Echo lengthens out the sound.</L>
<L>Lift up your heads coelestial gates they sing:</L>
<L>And see—they open to receive the king.</L>
<L>Th' expecting host their loudest accents raise—</L>
<L>Eternal God, how glorious are thy ways!</L>
<L>O for some great, some more than angel song,</L>
<L>To speak the praises which to Thee belong!</L>
<L>Imagination faints on this great scene;</L>
<L>Thought is too low, and majesty too mean:</L>
<L>So great thy condescention thus to own</L>
<L>Vile man, the meanest prostrate at thy throne!</L>
<L>May from his grateful altar ever rise</L>
<L>A glad perfume of incense to the skies.—</L>
