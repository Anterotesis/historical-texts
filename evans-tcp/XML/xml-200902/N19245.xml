<HEAD>AN ELEGY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>AWAKE, my muse, and seek great WESLEY fled!</L>
<L>This righteous man is number'd with the dead.</L>
<L>How sad and awful is the parting stroke,</L>
<L>Which hath the long subsisting union broke!</L>
<L>WESLEY is set, that bright that shining star,</L>
<L>Which oft conducted strangers from afar,</L>
<L>To come by faith, and taste their Saviour's grace,</L>
<L>And humbly bow their souls before his face.</L>
<L>How long he labour'd in the gospel field!</L>
<L>While hundred thousand souls his Mission seal'd:</L>
<L>Who heard the gospel from his willing tongue,</L>
<L>Upon his lips with fix'd attention hung:</L>
<L>Heard for their lives, and fled from wrath to come</L>
<L>And found in Jesu's arms a welcome home.</L>
<L>What regularity his life display'd!</L>
<L>By rule he liv'd; his mind on God was stay'd.</L>
<L>Jesus he lov'd, his Gospel he pursu'd,</L>
<L>And wish'd, like him, to be divinely good;</L>
<L>His temper cultivated in his breast,</L>
<L>He learnt of him, and found the promis'd rest;</L>
<L>Thought, spoke, and acted like his Lord divine,</L>
<L>And in the sight of men his light did shine.</L>
<L>His works of love, known only to the Lord,</L>
<L>Insure for him a rich, a large reward:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="025048_0003_0FCDAF57870C69B0"/>Ten thousand acts of gen'rous kindness shown,</L>
<L>Have gain'd him honour, glory, and renown.</L>
<L>Many have done great things, and are approv'd,</L>
<L>But he excell'd them all, for much he lov'd.</L>
<L>Long did he move in Wisdom's pleasant ways;</L>
<L>He lov'd and sought her in his youthful days:</L>
<L>And to his latest years advancing still</L>
<L>In that blest way that leads to Zion's hill,</L>
<L>He gain'd at last the bright, the glorious prize,</L>
<L>The tree of life, which grows in Paradise.</L>
<L>His life was dedicated to the Lord;</L>
<L>And more than sixty years he preach'd his word:</L>
<L>Some millions heard his ready tongue proclaim</L>
<L>The wonders of the great Redeemer's name.</L>
<L>The universal Saviour he confess'd,</L>
<L>And sought to bring mankind to taste his rest.</L>
<L>Proclaim'd abroad "He tasted death for all;"</L>
<L>And that his grace extensive, as the fall,</L>
<L>Is freely given to ev'ry willing mind,</L>
<L>Who seek their Saviour and their God to find:</L>
<L>That none were reprobated by decree,</L>
<L>But that God's saving grace for all is free.</L>
<L>He taught mankind their hopes of heaven to place</L>
<L>Upon the Saviour's merits, and his grace,</L>
<L>Proclaim'd Repentance, Faith, Hope, Joy, and Love:</L>
<L>Taught men the way that leads to God above:</L>
<L>Five words well understood will shew the way,</L>
<L>Repent, Believe, Hope, Love, <HI>and then</HI> Obey.</L>
<L>This was the glorious doctrine which he brought,</L>
<L>This to the human race he freely taught;</L>
<L>And this to many thousand souls was blest,</L>
<L>Brought weary wand'rers unto Christ for rest.</L>
<L>How vast, and, oh! how regular his plan,</L>
<L>For God's great glory, and the good of man!</L>
<L>How wide, and yet how pow'rful was his sphere!</L>
<L>He shed his influence far, as well as near.</L>
<L>His sermons and his num rous writings shin'd,</L>
<L>With heav'nly light, a blessing to mankind.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="025048_0004_0FCDAF59051FA928"/>His active soul flew swiftly to perform</L>
<L>His Father's will, his heart was always warm.</L>
<L>With God like Enoch he did spend his days:</L>
<L>Good works his business; preaching, pray'r and praise</L>
<L>These were his choicest pleasures ever high:</L>
<L>He wish'd in Jesu's cause to live and die.</L>
<L>The greatest ardour of his active mind</L>
<L>Was to proclaim the Gospel to mankind;</L>
<L>And make the Saviour's name and nature known</L>
<L>To all whom he had purchas'd for his own.</L>
<L>He joy'd to see the blood-bought human race</L>
<L>Partakers of the Saviour's love and grace:</L>
<L>He lov'd to see them walk in Wisdom's ways,</L>
<L>Hold fast the truth and joyful end their days.</L>
<L>He sought by every method in his pow'r</L>
<L>To spread the sacred Gospel more and more,</L>
<L>To turn the souls of men from death and sin,</L>
<L>And make them feel a Heav'n begun within.</L>
<L>He wish'd to see our Jesus rule and reign,</L>
<L>In every heart, that sin might all be slain:</L>
<L>That every soul might full salvation know,</L>
<L>And thus enjoy a Heav'n begun below.</L>
<L>How did he pray, and thirst, and pant, and long,</L>
<L>That Jesus might be prais'd by ev'ry tongue:</L>
<L>That all the world might taste redeeming love;</L>
<L>And be prepar'd for Heav'ns bright courts above.</L>
<L>And wheresoever he beheld a sign</L>
<L>That any heart was touch'd with pow'r divine,</L>
<L>It gave him joy beyond what harvest yields,</L>
<L>When plenteous crops are gathered from the fields</L>
<L>But hence my Muse: Come take a lofty flight,</L>
<L>Pursue this holy man to realms of light:</L>
<L>Behold him introduc'd to Heaven's high King?</L>
<L>Hark! how the Heav'nly arches loudly ring.</L>
<L>He comes, the faithful persevering man!</L>
<L>Whose life was govern'd by his Saviour's plan!</L>
<L>Who thought, spoke, acted, like his glorious Lord,</L>
<L>He comes to taste a part of his reward!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="025048_0005_0FCDAF5D00163B68"/>Behold his happy spirit swiftly rise!</L>
<L>To Heav'n he lifts his joyful wond'ring eyes!</L>
<L>Convey'd by angels swifter far than light,</L>
<L>The Heav'nly city soon appears in sight.</L>
<L>The shining gates of pearl are open'd wide,</L>
<L>And holy angels are his guard and guide.</L>
<L>How swift he marches on! fresh glory sees;</L>
<L>And traverses the sacred plain with ease.</L>
<L>But who is that stands waiting at the gate?</L>
<L>To bid him welcome in? What heav'nly state</L>
<L>Attends that glorious person? O 'tis he;</L>
<L>My Lord, the glorious man that dy'd for me;</L>
<L>He comes to welcome in his servant, John!</L>
<L>He takes him by the hand, and says, WELL DONE.</L>
<L>"Well done thou good and faithful servant, come,</L>
<L>"Partake of glory, Heav'n is now thy home.</L>
<L>"Thou shalt obtain the plaudit of thy God,</L>
<L>"And in his temple have thy fix'd abode.</L>
<L>"As thou hast faithfully his will obey'd,</L>
<L>"So shalt thou be a greater Ruler made:</L>
<L>"Far greater honour I'll on thee bestow</L>
<L>"Than ever was enjoy'd by kings below.</L>
<L>"Thy works of love were great, and not in vain,</L>
<L>"And from my hand thou shalt the prize obtain.</L>
<L>"With me thou shalt descend, and with me share</L>
<L>"The kingdom, sceptre, and a crown shall wear.</L>
<L>"Mean time, inherit now a glorious rest,</L>
<L>"And be with thousands of thy children blest."</L>
<L>As thus the Saviour spake, his servant bow'd</L>
<L>Adoring low before him; while aloud,</L>
<L>All heav'n resounded with the Saviour's praise,</L>
<L>Who takes such pleasure worms of earth to raise</L>
<L>To highest glories in the realms above;</L>
<L>He honours them who shew, that "God is love,"</L>
<L>But while my muse beholds this heav'nly scene,</L>
<L>Who can inform me what those triumphs mean?</L>
<L>Such crowds of shining spirits fly to meet,</L>
<L>This venerable man, and loudly greet,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="025048_0006_0FCDAF5E461DD390"/>And bid him welcome to the bliss divine:</L>
<L>Pray who are these, that in such glory shine?</L>
<L>These, says my kind instructor, are the bands</L>
<L>By him reclaim'd from sin, from Satan's hands,</L>
<L>Prepar'd for glory by his doctrine clear,</L>
<L>Went home before him, shout him welcome here.</L>
<L>See Fletcher, holy man, whose zeal and love,</L>
<L>Was so esteemed by all the hosts above;</L>
<L>Whose labour, faith, and patience to the last</L>
<L>Held out, till fears and dangers all were past.</L>
<L>See how he shines in glory ever bright,</L>
<L>And how he hails his friend to realms of light!</L>
<L>FLETCHER; that favourite of God and man,</L>
<L>How clearly he beheld Salvation's plan;</L>
<L>Saw through the parts, beheld the glorious whole;</L>
<L>Explor'd the gospel, with capacious soul!</L>
<L>Saw farther than he hath in words exprest,</L>
<L>But souls akin to his, can guess the rest.</L>
<L>His spirit, soul, and heart, were fill'd with love,</L>
<L>Love drew him on, and made him swiftly move.</L>
<L>While life immortal all his pow'rs inspir'd,</L>
<L>Sweetly he went to Christ as he desir'd.</L>
<L>His last day's labour in the house of God,</L>
<L>Push'd on his eager soul to its abode.</L>
<L>With what immortal pleasure did he rise</L>
<L>To join the happy millions in the skies!</L>
<L>Now he with rapture sees his ancient friend,</L>
<L>Come to possess those joys that never end.</L>
<L>His brother CHARLES, his fellow lab'rer dear,</L>
<L>With joy receives him, bids him welcome here.</L>
<L>He sweetly sang on earth, now sings above,</L>
<L>And shouts the Saviour's universal love.</L>
<L>How noble were his strains! how unconfin'd!</L>
<L>Vast was the scene which open'd to his mind!</L>
<L>His thoughts were boundless love, his voice was praise;</L>
<L>He liv'd to God, and joyful clos'd his days.</L>
<L>His sweet composures cannot be forgot,</L>
<L>His name, his memory shall never rot.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="025048_0007_0FCDAF5FC552DE88"/>Th' immortal God his numbers did inspire,</L>
<L>They glow'd with more than <HI>bare poetic</HI> fire.</L>
<L>The love of jesus was his darling theme,</L>
<L>Who shed his blood for all, dy'd to redeem</L>
<L>The race of men, without excepting one,</L>
<L>Who were by sin, and by the Fall undone.</L>
<L>Nor can I here omit that herald bright,</L>
<L>Who preach'd the Gospel with unrivall'd might;</L>
<L>WHITEFIELD, a name to many thousands dear;</L>
<L>Who sat with great delight his voice to hear,</L>
<L>Who like an Angel seem'd thro' heaven to fly,</L>
<L>Proclaiming, "Fear the God who made the sky,</L>
<L>"The earth and seas, and water fountains deep;</L>
<L>"Worship JEHOVAH, his commandments keep."</L>
<L>But Jesus was his most enliv'ning theme;</L>
<L>How shone his face whene'er he spoke of him?</L>
<L>So glorious were his talents, all confess'd</L>
<L>That as a speaker he excell'd the best.</L>
<L>No less than thirteen times he cross'd the main;</L>
<L>The love of Jesus did his soul constrain,</L>
<L>In Europe and America to preach,</L>
<L>That sinners he might call, warn, and beseech;</L>
<L>And pray them to be reconcil'd to God,</L>
<L>Through Jesus Christ, and his attoning blood.</L>
<L>How ardently he labour'd for mankind,</L>
<L>That peace and pardon they thro' Christ might find!</L>
<L>And spent his precious life in acts of love,</L>
<L>Till Jesus call'd his soul to dwell above.</L>
<L>There universal love fills all his sight,</L>
<L>He swims in the broad ocean with delight;</L>
<L>He sees what once he hardly dar'd to scan,</L>
<L>That God is loving unto every man.</L>
<L>His soul was fitted for the realms of day,</L>
<L>And holy tempers in his heart bore sway,</L>
<L>And therefore upward did his spirit rise,</L>
<L>To meet his glorious Lord in Paradise.</L>
<L>He knows his ancient friend and brother's face,</L>
<L>And bids him welcome to that blessed place:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="025048_0008_0FCDAF67DC9DCE40"/>Where all disputes are over, wranglings past.</L>
<L>But perfect peace and pleasures always last.</L>
<L>United now, each other they embrace,</L>
<L>Redeem'd alike by Jesus, sav'd through grace:</L>
<L>They view with pleasing eyes the num'rous train</L>
<L>Of blood-bought souls, for whom the Lamb was slain</L>
<L>Who first by them alarm'd, have sought and found.</L>
<L>Through Jesus Christ, free grace and love abound.</L>
<L>And having persever'd in holiness,</L>
<L>Have enter'd Heav'n, and glory now possess.</L>
<L>Hundreds of shining heralds, who proclaim'd</L>
<L>The Gospel, where the Saviour scarce was nam'd,</L>
<L>Who first invited home by WESLEY'S tongue,</L>
<L>Felt Jesu's pow'r, and join'd the happy throng:</L>
<L>Publish'd salvation to their fellow men,</L>
<L>Call'd and invited them, and call'd again:</L>
<L>At length their Saviour call'd their spirits home</L>
<L>To dwell with him, where troubles never come.</L>
<L>Now they rejoice, to see their leader rise,</L>
<L>And take possession of the heav'nly prize.</L>
<L>While hundred thousands' turn'd from sinful ways,</L>
<L>Liv'd holy lives, triumphing clos'd their days,</L>
<L>Now hail their first instructor to that shore</L>
<L>Where sin and sorrow, pain and death's no more.</L>
<L>Oh, what amazing pleasures now he feels,</L>
<L>To view such multitudes of heav'nly seals!</L>
<L>Souls that were giv'n him for his joyful crown,</L>
<L>Procure him from his Lord the best renown.</L>
<L>For whosoever winneth souls is wise,</L>
<L>(Souls are those treasures we should highly prize.)</L>
<L>And such as men to righteousness shall turn,</L>
<L>Shall shine like stars, those lamps of Heav'n that bur</L>
<L>Many hath WESLEY turn'd to righteousness,</L>
<L>And therefore, he this honour shall possess.</L>
<L>Nor him alone, for Christ, the living Lord,</L>
<L>Will give to all his faithful ones reward.</L>
<L>And we that labour in our little sphere,</L>
<L>If we are faithful in his service here,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="025048_0009_0FCDAF68CE8EAF40"/>Shall gain the plaudit of our Lord divine,</L>
<L>And in his heav'nly kingdom ever shine.</L>
<L>But as this man of God did honour him,</L>
<L>Who shed his blood, all sinners to redeem,</L>
<L>So Jesus gave him favour and success,</L>
<L>And wond rouily his ministry did bless.</L>
<L>Long did JEHOVAH lengthen out his time,</L>
<L>And long his faculties remain'd in prime:</L>
<L>His influence vast continu'd all his days,</L>
<L>And great designs fulfill'd to Jesu's praise,</L>
<L>He labour'd to the last with ardent pain,</L>
<L>And sought the wand ring souls of men to gain.</L>
<L>But just one week before his dying day,</L>
<L>With love and fervour he did preach and pray,</L>
<L>"Seek ye JEHOVAH while he may be found,</L>
<L>"Call on his name, while mercy doth abound;</L>
<L>"O put not off, until another day,</L>
<L>"Now while he's near at hand, arise and pray.</L>
<L>"Now let the wicked man forsake his crimes,</L>
<L>"And to our God JEHOVAH turn betimes.</L>
<L>"And let th' unrighteous man his thoughts forsake:</L>
<L>"His evil tempers, and to pray'r betake:</L>
<L>"Then God his grace and mercy will bestow,</L>
<L>"Their sins forgive, and save their souls from woe."</L>
<L>The point he labour'd long with earnestness,</L>
<L>And on his hearers did repentance press.</L>
<L>Thus nobly clos'd his public labours then,</L>
<L>Finish'd his work on earth. Now gone from men,</L>
<L>He walks with Jesus, sees him as he is,</L>
<L>High in salvation, and the Climes of Bliss.</L>
<L>In Heav'n is joy, fullness of joy in store,</L>
<L>At God's right hand are pleasures evermore.</L>
<L>And what from mortal eyes must be conceal'd,</L>
<L>Is to the heirs of glory there reveal'd.</L>
<L>Freedom from sin and sorrow, guilt and pain,</L>
<L>And ev'ry evil inclination slain;</L>
<L>Beholding Jesus Christ with open face,</L>
<L>Resting for ever in his lov'd embrace:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="025048_0010_0FCDAF6A463F4610"/>Being conform'd to him in perfect love;</L>
<L>And join'd to all the heav'nly hosts above;</L>
<L>Praising the name of God in loudest strains,</L>
<L>Adoring Christ, who high in glory reigns;</L>
<L>If this is Heav'n and this their blest employ,</L>
<L>Who dwell in Jesu's presence, sure 'tis joy,</L>
<L>Lord let us enter there when life is past,</L>
<L>And, taste those joys which shall for ever last.</L>
