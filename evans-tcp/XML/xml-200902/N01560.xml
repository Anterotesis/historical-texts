<HEAD>The EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Decay of Family Piety is an awful Symptom of the Dying State of Reli∣gion among a People: And if ever GOD shews Mercy to a Degenerate Land, He will pour out His Spirit upon Families, and thereby give a Glorious Resurrection to Religion in them.</P>
<P>THAT there is a Scandalous Negli∣gence in this Day of Apostacy, in all the vi∣tal Parts of that Service, which GOD re∣quires of Heads of Families with their Houses, is too notorious to be Denyed,
<PB N="ii" REF="001854_0004_0FB91CC0C2F76258"/>and too reproachful to Christianity, not to be Lamented, with the most sorrow∣ful Resentments of Soul, by all, that have the Glory of CHRIST, and the Prospe∣rity of Souls at Heart.</P>
<P>THIS flows not from Mens Ignorance of their Duty; but from their resolved obstinacy, and willfull Inconsideration, which hinders them from a just sense of their many Obligations hereto.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed some, who call themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> who pretend they see no Warrant or Obligation to <HI>Family-Prayer,</HI> which is a Principal part of that Service, we owe to GOD with our Hou∣ses: They therefore Demand an Express Precept for Divine Worship in their Fa∣milies: And with this they hope to justify their Criminal Neglect of this Duty. But assuredly whatever trifling Pleas any may make to silence the Cla∣mours of Conscience; yet few or none
<PB N="iii" REF="001854_0005_0FB91CC196B5D7C0"/>in their cool and serious Thoughts, can think them sufficient to acquit them from Guilt at the Bar of <HI>Conscience,</HI> much less at the Tribunal of CHRIST.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, since there are such, as seem to doubt of their Obligations to this Essential Part of Family-Religion; I shall Offer a few Hints, which may Awa∣ken and Assist their Powers of Thought and Reflection to a sight of the Equity and Reasonableness, the Expediency and Necessity of Family Worship.</P>
<P>HERE it may be Observed that the Obligation to this Duty, is Originally Founded in the Law and Light of <HI>Na∣ture;</HI> and not on Positive <HI>Institution:</HI> And by Consequence, the less need to require an Express Direction for it in <HI>Revelation.</HI> Yet we are not without plain Intimations of it in Scripture Ex∣amples and Precepts.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="001854_0006_0FB91CC563076840"/>
AGREEABLE hereto we find Solemn Acts of Worship attended in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fa∣mily; In <HI>Abraham</HI>'s House: for where∣ever we find him Pitching his Tent, there we see him <HI>Erecting an Altar</HI> of Worship: And there appear Evident Indications that this was <HI>Job</HI>'s, <HI>Joshua</HI>'s, and <HI>David</HI>'s Practise. And most proba∣bly, this was intended in <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s Cha∣racter; Act. 10.2. <HI>He feared GOD,</HI> i. e. Worshipped Him <HI>with all his House.</HI> In many Places of the New-Testament we have this Duty pointed at. We are Commanded to <HI>Pray with all Prayer,</HI> Eph. 6 18. Which certainly includes Family-Prayer. And when the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> had lay'd down the Duties of the several Members of a Family, he then Exhorts them <HI>as One to continue in Prayer,</HI> Col. 4.2. And <HI>to Pray together.</HI> verse 3. as that Place might be more justly ren∣dred. This sort of Prayer the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> seems to have his Eye upon, in that Admonition, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.7. But we need
<PB N="v" REF="001854_0007_0FB91CC6D859FE58"/>not insist on these; since this is an Act of Natural Worship, and not purely In∣stituted; and as such approves it self to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>son and Conscience of Men.</P>
<P>HENCE, all Nations, who were so just as to acknowledge a <HI>GOD</HI> and a <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> have conspired in the Practise hereof. The Heathen under the Con∣duct of the Light of Nature Erected their <HI>Family-Altars,</HI> and Offered Daily Sacri∣fices in their Houses.</P>
<P>AND if the Foundation of Divine Worship in General be considered, it will strongly Enforce the Practise of Family-Devotion. The Fundamental Reasons of Divine Worship flow from the Nature of GOD, and that state of absolute Depen∣dance, and necessary Subjection that Man stands in to such a Glorious Being. The Relation that reasonable Creatures stand in to the Blessed GOD, a Being of Infinite Excellency and Perfection, as He is their
<PB N="vi" REF="001854_0008_0FB91CC856785990"/>Creator, Preserver and Benefactor, their Owner, Lord and Lawgiver; does Infer an immutable Obligation to pay this Divine Homage and Worship. Now will not our Obligations, for the same Rea∣sons, be as strong to pay GOD the Tri∣bute of <HI>Family-Worship?</HI> Sure we are, That GOD is the Founder, Father, Be∣nefactor, and Owner of <HI>Families:</HI> By His Care and Providence our Houses are Built, our Families Subsist, Grow and Flourish. What then more just and rea∣sonable than to Worship Him as the GOD of our Families, and the Fountain of all their Blessings? And by Solemn Joynt-Prayer in our Houses religiously to ac∣knowledge His Propriety in, and Domi∣nion over us and our Houses; and our Dependance on and Subjection to Him. This certainly is one way to give GOD the Honour due to His Name. Family Prayer is on this account GOD's Right; and to with-hold it will be found Gross Injustice, and Black Ingratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="001854_0009_0FB91CCA9B296E20"/>
IT is acknowledged by all, that the more Publick the Honour we pay to GOD, the greater it is: Now <HI>Family-Worship</HI> is more Honourable to GOD on this account, than <HI>Solitary:</HI> And since we are bound to Worship GOD in the best manner we can, we must conclude our Family-Sacrifices must not be with∣held.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The Necessity and Reasona∣bleness of Family-Prayer will be Evident if we Consider, That this Religious Practise has a necessary and direct Ten∣dency to promote all other Holy, and Religious Intentions in a Family. Here∣by Heads of Families themselves are awed to a greater Circumspection and Care in their walk before their Houses: And it has a blessed Tendency to beget and cherish an awful Sense of GOD in the Hearts of the whole Family; and to Awaken them to a just concern for their Souls: This tends to give Life and Force to all the Solemn Counsels, Instructions
<PB N="viii" REF="001854_0010_0FB91CCEACE40120"/>and Admonitions given by Parents and Masters in the Name of GOD to those under their Charge. And in these respects Family-Worship must be accounted what is Good, and what the Lord requires of us.</P>
<P>IN a Word, I can't see what just claim a Family, as such a Society, has to the Character of a <HI>Christian</HI> or <HI>Religious</HI> Fa∣mily, if <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> and Worship be wholly neglected.</P>
<P>IF after all, any will indulge themselves in the neglect of this Duty; and please themselves that they are not under Ob∣ligation hereto: I would take Liberty to Leave Two or Three Enquiries with them to be resolved.</P>
<P>DO you really believe GOD is as well pleased with, and as much honoured by your Omission of Family-Prayer, as He would be by a Religious Performance of it?</P>
<P>DO you apprehend that you have done all in your power for the Good of the Souls of your Family; while you neglect to Pray with them?</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="001854_0011_0FB91CCFD6F096D0"/>
DARE you advise your Children, when they come to settle in Houses of their own, to follow your Example, and live in the Neg∣lect of Prayer in their Families?</P>
<P>IN a Word, Are you willing that Death should overtake you, while you live in the Omission of this part of Worship? Can you say, upon mature Deliberation, that you expect as much Peace and Com∣fort in a Dying Hour, from a Reflection on the <HI>Neglect,</HI> as on the Conscientious <HI>Discharge</HI> hereof? Let Conscience An∣swer: and be Obsequious to it's Voice. And then I doubt not this Neglected Duty would be Revived; and Family-Sacrifices daily offer'd to GOD, <HI>i. e.</HI> Morning and Evening: Thus was the daily Sacrifice under the Law offer'd Morning and Evening. And if daily Per∣sonal Wants and Mercies do Challenge daily Supplications and Thanksgivings from particular Persons: by a Parity of Reason, The Wants and Mercies of a
<PB N="x" REF="001854_0012_0FB91CD1567F2F90"/>Family, which are daily and continual, do require daily Addresses from them in Consort. And nothing can be more Come∣ly and Beautiful, nor more agreeable to the Ends of such a Duty, than for all the Members of a Family to Unite with one Mouth and Heart to <HI>shew forth the Lov∣ing Kindness of the LORD in the Morning: however that he, we Evening.</HI></P>
<P>AND nothing can be more Worthy the Thought and Care of CHRIST's Mini∣sters, who are called to Watch for Souls, and must give an Account of them, than with great Frequency, and all possible Importunity, to Inculcate this great Duty upon their Charge.</P>
<P>NOW this Principal part of Family-Religion, together with all other Acts and Instances thereof, is recommended to us in the following Solid, and Judicious Dis∣courses: which are every way adapted to Revive the Power of Godliness in our Houses.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="001854_0013_0FB91CD3D991A780" MS="y"/>
I design not an Encomium on the Re∣verend Author, or his Performances: His Modesty will not allow me to do him Justice. However I can't but say, that as the Subject of these Sermons are most Important and Weighty, so it is Treated with Perspicuity, Gravity, and due So∣lemnity, with that justness of Thought and Language; and the whole quickned with that holy Warmth and Spirit of Piety, that can't fail of an high Relish with every Serious and Judicious Reader.</P>
<P>AND, as I do heartily bless <HI>GOD,</HI> who directed the Thoughts of His Servant to this Subject, and assisted him in his Me∣ditations hereon; so cannot but joyn with him in Recommending the Serious Perusal of them to all Heads of Families; but more especially to those under our Joynt Pastoral Care: And do hope, by the Presence and Blessing of CHRIST with these Labours of my Reverend Bro∣ther, more of the Beauty of Holiness may
<PB N="xii" REF="001854_0014_0FB91CD51681D358"/>be seen, and more of the Gracious Presence of GOD enjoy'd in our Houses.</P>
<P>LET us therefore in Fidelity to the Trust GOD has committed to us; and which ere-long we must give an Account of before the Bar of CHRIST; and in Compassion to the Souls of our Children and Servants, which we have undertaken the Charge of, Let us, I say, Entertain and Practise the Counsels of Wisdom here gi∣ven us: Let us use our utmost Endeavours that we and our Houses may Serve the LORD with a perfect Heart and a willing Mind. In this way we may hope to be found of our Judge in Peace, and have our part in the Glories and Satisfactions of the Resurrection-World. For which holy Purposes the following Sermons are with Fervency Recommended to the In∣fluences of the Spirit of Grace.</P>

<HEAD>DESIRES That <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Resolution May be Revived.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOSHUA XXIV. 15.</BIBL>
<P>And if it seem Evil unto you to Serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will Serve; whether the gods which your Fa∣thers Served, that were on the other side of the Floud, or the god of the Amorites, in whose Land ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>well: But as for Me and My House, we will Serve the LORD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Book containeth in History of the Seventeen Years of the Rule of <HI>Joshua.</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Lighfoot</HI> Vol. 1 P. 39.</NOTE></P>
<P>It's uncertain who was the Pen∣man of this Part of Sacred Writ: Some Conjecture that <HI>Joshua</HI> Wrote it himself: however that be, we
<PB N="2" REF="001854_0016_0FB91CDA5924BCB0"/>know it was Written of him, and is a very notable and entertaining History of the wonderful Provi∣dences of GOD towards His People, and their E∣nemies, under his Administration. It acquaints us how GOD brought the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> into the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> with an high hand, and an out∣stretched arm, dividing the Waters of <HI>Jordan,</HI> delivering into their hands the Kings of the <HI>Ca∣naanites,</HI> their Lands, and Cities.</P>
<P><HI>JOSHUA</HI> was an eminent Type of CHRIST both in Name and Office. His Name bespeaks, him to be a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and is the same with <HI>Jesus</HI> only <HI>Joshua</HI> retains the <HI>Hebrew; Jesus</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> termination. Agreeably He is call'd <HI>Jesus</HI> by the Seventy; and also in the New-Testament. And indeed JESUS is the True JOSHUA, the <HI>Saviour</HI> of GOD's <HI>Israel;</HI> He is the <HI>Captain of our Salvation, and was given to be a Leader and Commander to the People,</HI> to Lead them to those glorious Mansions prepared for them in the <HI>Heavenly Canaan. Moses</HI> did not lead <HI>Israel</HI> into <HI>Canaan;</HI> for the Law made nothing Perfect; but <HI>Joshua</HI> did, and therein he was a Type of Christ, who hath His Name <HI>Jesus,</HI> because <HI>He Saves His People from their Sins;</HI> Subdues their Enemies for them, and conducts them to their Everlasting Rest.</P>
<P>BUT to return, In this Chapter wherein is our Text, we have an account of some of the Excel∣lent Things which <HI>Joshua</HI> did just before his Death. Great were the Pains which he took to Establish GOD's Ancient People in His true Faith and Worship.</P>
<P>FOR this End, (1) <HI>Joshua</HI> assembled all the Tribes at <HI>Sichem.</HI> (2) He put them in mind of
<PB N="3" REF="001854_0017_0FB91CDBD859F2A0"/>the wonderful Favours which GOD had shown to their Fathers, and themselves. (3) He im∣prov'd the Narrative which he had given of GOD's Wonderful and Miraculous Appearances for them, in a Word of Exhortation, and a solemn Charge, to Fear and Serve the LORD. (4) He call'd upon them to determine, and choose whom they would Serve; and makes a solemn Protestation for himself, and Family, that they would Serve the LORD. (5) He renew'd the Covenant of the LORD with the People, Wrote these Words in the Book of the Law, and set up a great Stone as a Me∣morial of this Covenant-Transaction, and as a Witness of their Engagements to be the LORD's.</P>
<P>THE Words of our Text contain the Call which <HI>Josua</HI> gives the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> to choose and determine whom they would Serve, and the reso∣lute Protestation which He makes for Himself, and Houshold, that they would Serve the LORD.</P>
<P>BEFORE I Name the DOCTRINE intended Principally to be insisted on, I shall mention se∣veral Doctrinal Observations from these Words, and as they stand related to the Context.</P>
<P>Obser. I. <HI>THEY that would Serve the LORD; must Renounce Obedience to Satan, the World, and their Lusts; and must Resolve to be for GOD, and for no other.</HI></P>
<P>Obser. II. <HI>IF we would Engage in the Service of GOD; We must do it Deliberately, and of Choice.</HI></P>
<P>Obser. III. <HI>THEY that would Fear, and Serve the LORD; they must do it in Sincerity, and in Truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001854_0018_0FB91CDE17F3A720"/>
Obser. IV. <HI>ALTHOUGH the Genernlity of a Professing People should forsake the LORD, and Serve other gods: Yet we should resolutely Adhere to Him, and continue Stedfast in His Service.</HI></P>
<P>Obser. I. <HI>THEY that would Serve the LORD; they must Renounce Obedience to Satan, the World, and their Lusts: and must Resolve to be for GOD, and for no other.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Saviour hath Assur'd us, that <HI>No man can Serve Two Masters:</HI> for either he will hate the One, and love the Other; or else he will hold to the One, and despise the Other, <HI>Ye cannot Serve GOD and Mammon,</HI> Mat. 6.24. We cannot Serve GOD and our Lusts; GOD, and this Sinful World: for they are Contrary, as Light and Darkness. The Truth of this doctrinal Proposition will ap∣pear, as Written with a Sun-beam, if we consider,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>WE Wave but ONE Supream LORD, the Eternal GOD.</HI> Indeed, it is inconsistent with the Nature of the Thing, and implys the greatest Contradiction, that there should be Two Supream Infinite Beings essentially distinct. GOD is One: Deut. 6.4. <HI>Hear, O Israel, The LORD our God is One LORD.</HI> He who is Omniscient tells us, that He knows not any besides Himself, <HI>Isai.</HI> 44.8. There are Three Persons in the Godhead, The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: But then these <HI>Three</HI> are Essentially <HI>One;</HI> One in the same Un∣divided Essence, and all the Essential Glories of it. Accordingly, the blessed GOD can brook no Ri∣val; He must be Lov'd with <HI>all</HI> the Heart; and nothing else must be lov'd at all, but in subor∣dination
<PB N="5" REF="001854_0019_0FB91CE09397BB58"/>to Him. He must be Obey'd without Limitation, and Served with all our Powers. And therefore if we would Serve the LORD; we must deny Obedience to <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> and our <HI>Lusts;</HI> and by the Grace of God, bring every proud Thought and Imagination, into Sub∣jection to His Will. If GOD Rule in our hearts, and be enthroned there; the government of Satan, and Lust, and the World, must be pulled down.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>THE Laws whereby the blessed GOD Governs His People, are directly contrary to the law of Sin, and the corrupt rules and maxims of a Sinful World.</HI> For the Law of GOD is holy; and the Command∣ment holy, and just, and good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12. And therefore while the Mind is under the govern∣ment, and influence of Sin, and Satan, who rules in the hearts of the Children of Disobedience; it's Enmity against GOD, is not subject to His Law, nor indeed can be. For it's impossible to live in Obedience to the Law of GOD, and the law of Sin, at the same time: for their Commands are Contrary; so that if we Obey One, in that very article we disobey the Other. Certainly then, if we would Serve the LORD; we must forsake Sin, and the World, and say with them: Isai. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.13. <HI>O LORD our God, other lords besides Thee have had dominion over us: bus by Thee Only will we make mention of thy Name.</HI> We must Acknowledge GOD alone for out Supream Lord; and make His Law the Rule of our Lives: we must not live in Sin, nor be conformed to this evil World; but be transformed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out Minds. Our Lusts must be Mortify'd by the Grace of GOD; or His King∣dom, which is Righteousness as well as Peace, and Joy, can't be set up, and flourish in our Souls.
<PB N="6" REF="001854_0020_0FB91CE1D6AE3E70"/>If we would <HI>joyn</HI> our selves to the LORD, we must be <HI>separated</HI> from our Lusts.</P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>LEARN what great Folly they are chargable with, who imagine that they can Serve GOD, and their Lusts too.</HI> This is a most absurd thing; and they that flatter themselves, as if they could Serve Two such Masters, are egregiously mistaken; and may well be call'd Unreasonable men. It's a most vain and monstrous attempt to go about to Reconcile the Service of the holy GOD, which is glorious <HI>Liberty and Freedom;</HI> with the <HI>Bondage</HI> of impure Lusts, and vile Affections. What can be more absurd than to suppose that Men may live in the gratification of their Lusts; and at the same time, <HI>Walk Worthy of the LORD, unto all Well-pleasing!</HI> You may a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well Unite Truth, and Fallhood; Heaven, and Hell, and make them One; as Serve GOD acceptably, and yet continue your Service and Slavery to Sin, and the World. <HI>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</HI> 1 John, 2.15. And yet 'tis to be fear'd, there are not a few who are guilty of this Folly. They can't bear to be divorced from their beloved Lusts; but hold fast their Iniquities, and refuse to let them go. There are not a few that set up an idol of Jealously in their hearts; prefer the Pleasures, or Profits, or Honours of this World before the blessed GOD; and yet presume that they are the Servants of the LORD, and upon good Terms with Him: now this is most Unreasonable and Contradictory. Such may cry Lord, Lord; but they will be rejected, and punish'd as Rebels against GOD, His Crown and Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001854_0021_0FB91CE41678BB38"/>
USE, II. <HI>LET us be Exhorted to Renounce Obedience to our Lusts; and to give up our selves to the LORD, to be for Him, and Him Only.</HI> He is our Rightful Lord and Soveraign. As for other lords that have had dominion over us; they are but Usurpers. O let us then forsake them, and return unto the Lord our GOD; let us no longer bow down to Idols which cannot Save us; let us no longer contince in the Drudgery of Sin and Satan. But let us now go to GOD, fall down at His Feet, and Cry to Him to pull down the strong Holds of Satan; and to set up His Kingdom in our hearts. Let us be earnest with Him to deliver us from the Cruel Tyranny of our Lusts, which seek the Ruine of our Immortal Souls; and that He would Vindicate us into the Liberty of the Sons of GOD, and make us the LORD's Freemen. If we Serve the LORD and have our Fruit unto Holiness, our End will be Life Everlasting.</P>
<P>Obser. II. <HI>IF we would Engage in the Service of GOD; we must do it Deliberately, and of Choice.</HI></P>
<P>WE must give our selves to the LORD, and choose Him for our LORD and Master. <HI>Choose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this day whom ye will Serve.</HI> Now this doth not suppose that it was a matter of Indifferency whether they would Serve the Living GOD, or their Idols. The meaning is not, that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Liberty, and might lawfully either chuse, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se the Service of GOD. Nor doth it suppose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is a matter about which we might hesitate; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we might delay, and put off, under a pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of taking Time to consider of it. No! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.
<PB N="8" REF="001854_0022_0FB91CE5965B0D90"/>As soon as ever CHRIST called <HI>James</HI> and <HI>John, They preseutly left the Ship and their Father, and followed Him,</HI> Mat. 4.21, 22. But it may intend that we must make Religion our Serious, intel∣ligent and Deliberate <HI>Choice;</HI> that we must Freely Resign up our selves to the LORD, and yield a full <HI>Cousent</HI> to the Terms of the Covenant. This must be our own <HI>Voluntary</HI> act and deed. GOD accepts of none in His Service, but <HI>Volun∣teers.</HI> Indeed He exercises a Soveraign Dominion over His Enemies, and makes them Serve His De∣signs, whether they will, or no. But He Accepts of the Service of none, but such as are His <HI>Wil∣ling People.</HI> If we would have GOD for <HI>Our GOD,</HI> and be acknowledged by Him, as <HI>His People;</HI> We must, by His Grace, Open the door of our Wills unto Him, that <HI>this King of Glory may Come in; We must yield our selves unto GOD, as those that are alive from the dead,</HI> Rom. 6.13. We must by a deliberate, and free Consent make Over our selves unto the LORD, and bind our selves unto Him in an Everlasting Covenant never to be broken; To be for Him, and for no other; To Love, Obey, and Serve Him for ever. It's true, GOD's Right, and Title to us; and our Obligation to Obey and Serve Him; do not depend upon any act of our Wills. For His Government over us is Natural, and Necessary; and we are indispensibly oblig'd to Obey His Commands, by the Law of our Crea∣tion. He <HI>Will</HI> be our Rightful LORD, whether we will, or no. However, if we would Serve the LORD in an Active Way, so as to be Own'd and rewarded as good and faithful Servants, through infinite rich Grace in CHRIST: We must from our own Judgment, make Choice of the LORD JEHOVAH for Our GOD, with a strong In∣clination, and steady bent of our Will towards

And this implies an Assent to the Terms of the Covenant; and an holy Resolution and un∣feigned Willingness to perform those Duties which GOD requires of us.

We must Choose Him also for our <HI>Portion</HI> and <HI>Inheritance;</HI> and say, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee?</HI> We must Choose the LORD for our <HI>Master,</HI> and freely bow our Necks to the Yoke of CHRIST.

And le∣gal Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours are made use of by GOD, to drive Men to CHRIST, to prepare the way for their Reception of Him.

Our Minds are naturally Darkened; our practical Judgment misguided, ha∣ving a wrong Biass upon it; our Will is Depra∣ved and Corrupted by Sin; so that there is an ut∣ter Impotency to will that which is Spiritually Good in a right manner; unless GOD do by His Spirit change our Hearts, and of Unwilling make us Willing. Let us then cry to GOD that for CHRIST's sake, He would savingly Enlighten our Understandings, Reform and Rectify our Judgments, and Conquer the Obstinacy and Perverseness of our Wills, and enable us to yield our selves to Him; O that we had, each of us, Grace to give up our selves to the LORD, and fully to consent to become His Servants, according to the Tenour of the New Covenant! GOD doth now graci∣ously Invite us to come unto Him, and offers to become <HI>Ours</HI> upon Gospel Terms. Let us then pre∣sent our selves unto GOD, and yield up our selves unto Him. O that we could say that we are heartily Willing to be the LORD's; O that this might be the Day of GOD's Power to our Souls for this end! Then it would be a joyful, and an happy Day indeed. But if we do now reject GOD and CHRIST, and refuse to make Choise of the LORD for our GOD: we can't tell whe∣ther we shall ever have such another Offer. GOD doth this Day set before us Life, and Death; Blessing, and Cursing: Let us then choose Life, that we may live. I conclude with those Words, Deut. 30.19, 20. <HI>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: That thou mayst love the LORD thy GOD, and that thou mayst obey his voice, and that thou mayst cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days.</HI></P>

<P N="5">V. 14. <HI>Now therefore, fear the Lord, and serve him in Sincerity, and in Truth</HI> — We must serve GOD with a true and a perfect Heart, and see that we be Upright before Him. (1.) They that would Serve the LORD, must yield True and Unfeigned Obedience to Him. Psal. 51.6. <HI>Behold, thou desirest Truth in the inward parts.</HI> GOD expects that we be <HI>Really</HI> and <HI>Truly</HI> that which we profess to be. We must not be faise and deceitful in our Pretences to Religion. We must see to it, that the <HI>Inward</HI> tem∣per and frame of our Spirit don't contradict and give the lie to our <HI>Outward</HI> deportment and be∣haviour. For Hypocrisy is an abomination to the LORD. (2.) We must Serve GOD with our <HI>Whole</HI> heart, in <HI>Integrity.</HI> If we would Serve the LORD, we must give up our Selves to Him <HI>Wholly</HI> and without Reserve, and Obey His Commands impartially. Unless we give up our Selves en∣tirely to the LORD, to Serve Him with all our Powers; Unless we have respect unto all His Com∣mandments; We are not Sincere. And GOD will not own us for His faithful Servants. John, 4.24. <HI>GOD is a Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and they that Worship Him, must worship in Spirit and in truth.</HI></P>

But the All seeing GOD cannot be thus impos'd upon. So that if we would Serve Him to any good Purpose, we must be Hearty and in Earnest, and not think to deceive GOD with a shew of Piety, and an External Form of Godliness. No, no, GOD will not be thus mocked. Eph. 6.5, 6. — <HI>in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ: Not with eye service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of GOD from the heart.</HI></P>
<P N="2">GOD is the <HI>True</HI> GOD; and all the preci∣ous Promises which He makes unto His People, are in <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Sincerity.</HI> Jer. 10.10. <HI>The LORD is the True GOD.</HI> Idols are lying vanities. The Creature many times promiseth more than it can perform, and so deceiveth our Expectation: But <HI>the Strength of Israel will not lie,</HI> 1 Sam. 15.29. All the Offers of Grace which He makes us, are <HI>True.</HI> Heb. 10.23. <HI>He is Faithful that promised.</HI> His Word is <HI>Truth,</HI> and sooner may Heaven and Earth pass away, than one jot or tittle of it fail. His Promises are <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen</HI> in CHRIST, who is the <HI>Truth.</HI> GOD will be so far from deceiving the Expectations of His People, that He will do for them <HI>exceeding abundantly above all that they ask or think,</HI> Eph. 3.20. Now, if we serve such a <HI>True</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> Master; certainly, it becomes us to be <HI>true</HI> and <HI>sincere</HI> in His Service. It is a base and vile thing to go about to deceive an honest Man, who is true and punctual to his Word: How much
<PB N="13" REF="001854_0027_0FB91CF01750DB58"/>more vile and abominable is it to deal treacherously with that GOD, who is the Essential and Eternal Truth? GOD is a Lover of Truth; and He hates Deceit and Falshood: we should therefore serve the LORD in Righteousness and true Holiness.</P>
<P N="3">GOD gives Himself to his People <HI>Wholly,</HI> i. e. for all those intents and purposes which are ne∣cessary to make them Compleatly happy. And therefore they should serve the LORD in Sincerity, and with a perfect heart. God gives Himself to his People as their Shield, and exceeding great Reward. All His Attributes are engaged in promoting their Welfare. His Wisdom is employ'd to counsel, guide and lead them; His Power, to protect and defend them; His Grace and Mercy, to pity, par∣don and save them. Certainly then, they are under the strongest Obligations to serve GOD Sincerely and in Integrity, with their whole heart, and all their Powers.</P>
<P>USE. LET us Pray to GOD to make us <HI>True</HI> and Sincere, to give us <HI>Truth in the inward parts.</HI> We should be earnest with GOD to search us, and try us, and see whether there be any wicked way in us, and to <HI>lead us in the way everlasting,</HI> Psal. 139.23, 24. Let us look to it that we be <HI>Israelites indeed, in whom there is no Guile;</HI> no prevailing iniquity, no governing Fraud and deceit. Let us Pray to GOD to <HI>Renew us in the spirit of our Mind, and to help us to put on the New Man.</HI> Let us take care that we be <HI>True,</HI> true to GOD, true to our Neighbour, true to our Profession.</P>

Obser. IV. <HI>THE Children of GOD must Resolve to Adhere to Him, and to Continue stedfast in His Service; although the generality of a Professing People should forsake Him.</HI></P>
<P>THUS <HI>Joshua, If it seem evil to you to Serve the LORD, choose ye — But as for Me and My House, we will Serve the LORD.</HI> We must not run with a Multitude to do evil; but must endeavour to stem the Tide, and swim against the Stream. The Apostle stood firm in the Cause of GOD, when <HI>no man stood with him, but all forsook him,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.16. It will be no sufficient Plea to say that the Cause of CHRIST was deserted by <HI>Many.</HI> No, there is more need for us to be Resolute, and Active, and Vigorous in His Service. When Iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxeth Cold; We must strive that our Zeal for GOD, and the fervour of our Spirit, be thereby invigorated and increased as by an holy Antiperistasis. The Consideration of this should inflame us with ardent desires to do much for GOD, and to abound in every good Work. This should the rather make us Resolve, that tho' Multitudes forsake CHRIST, yet will not we; and this not with carnal Confidence; but with humble Trust and Dependence on GOD. We must remember that there is no Authority in the Voice of the <HI>Many</HI> or the <HI>Mighty</HI> to legitimat Vice. Tho' hand join in hand the Sinner shall not go Unpunished. We must stick close to GOD and our Duty, tho' the whole World should rise up against us, and Per∣secute us for it. In a time of general Apostasie, GOD looks to see who will espouse His Cause and stand up for it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001854_0029_0FB91CF5579FCE48"/>
THIS is the way to testify our Fidelity to GOD, and to obtain distinguishing Marks of His favour. A Friend is tryed in a Day of Adversity; and so is a Man's Fidelity to GOD, in an hour of such Temptation. In this way we shall give a Seasonable Testimony for GOD, and set to our Seal to con∣firm the Truth of Religion. This also is the way to obtain the peculiar Marks of GOD's Favour: Ezek. 9.4, 5. <HI>The Lord said unto him, go through the midst of the City, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the Fore-heads of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. And to the others he said in mine hearing, go ye after him through the City, and smite,</HI> — They that distinguish themselves by their Fidelity in GOD's Service in times of abounding iniquity, will have encouraging grounds of hope that GOD will remember them in Mercy when He brings Evil upon a degenerate People, and take them into the secret Chambers of His Protection until the Indignation be over-past. Moreover, a few thus Spirited may be Instrumental to Reform a backsliding People, and to Save them from Ruine. Such will stand in the Gap, and may by the Grace of GOD, be employed to make up the breach, and to keep off impending Judgment from a People. Had there been Ten Righteous Persons found in <HI>Sodom,</HI> GOD would have spared the Place for their sake.</P>
<P>The Doctrine principally to be insisted on, is this,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>IT is our indispensible Duty to Resolve, in the strength of GOD's Grace, That we will Serve the LORD; And the Heads of Families should not only Serve GOD themselves, but also take care that their Houses joyn with them in Serving the LORD.</HI></P>

<P>PROP. II. <HI>THE Heads of Families should Serve the LORD themselves, and take can that their Houses joyn with them in Serving the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>IT is our indispensible Duty to Resolve, in the strength of GOD's Grace, that we will Serve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is fairly implyed in our Text. For here we have <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Resolution respecting himself, <HI>But as for me</HI> — It nearly concerns every One of us to say, <HI>I will Serve the LORD.</HI> We have not all of us the Charge of a Family committed to us; but we are all of us obliged to take up this holy Resolution for our Selves, that we will Serve the LORD. And unless we give up our Selves to the LORD, there will be little Probability that we shall labour to engage Others in His Service. Here then in the first Place, we may Consider this great Duty as incumbent upon each, and every One of us Per∣sonality.</P>
<P>First, WE are to Enquire, What's imply'd in Serving the LORD?</P>
<P>Secondly, WHAT Obligations we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly under to the Performance of this Duty? The First of these is very Large and Comprehensive, and includes all that Duty and Obedience which we owe to GOD. To Serve GOD implies that we Own and Acknow∣ledge Him for our Supream LORD and Master, that we yield Obedience to Him in all things. We must subject our Understanding, Will, and
<PB N="17" REF="001854_0031_0FB91CF857F9A260"/>Affections, and all our Powers unto GOD; to be Guided and Governed by Him. If we would be the Servants of GOD, we must no longer walk in the way of our own Heart, and sight of our own Eyes; but must conform to the Will of GOD reveal'd in His Holy Word, making the Law of GOD the Rule of our Lives and Actions. Rom. 6.16. <HI>His Servants you are to whom you Obey.</HI> In this manner we must Honour and Reverence GOD. Mal. 1.6. <HI>A Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Master,</HI> by Obedience. Serving the LORD intends, that we look to Him for Direction in our Work. Act. 9.6. <HI>LORD, what wilt thou have me to do!</HI> And then, it intends, that we do all with an Eye to GOD's Glory. Servants are Oblig'd to seek their Masters Profit in what they do. And if we would approve our selves the Faithful Servants of GOD, we must not seek our own Glory, but the Glory of GOD. Rom. 14.7, 8. <HI>For none of us liveth to himself, and no Man dreth to himself</HI> — We must Study how we may spend our Time, and lay out our selves so as shall be most for GOD's Honour, and for the Advancement of the Interest of His Kingdom. We must take cure to Engage with all our Heart and Strength in the more immediate Service of GOD; and see that we keep our Secular Affairs in a due Subordina∣tion. It might have been said, that our Obedience to GOD must be Free and Unconstrained, Sin∣cere and Universal, Constant and Uniform. But I have prevented my self in what has been al∣ready spoken under the foregoing Observations, and therefore shall proceed,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="001854_0032_0FB91CFA796ECDF8"/>
TO Consider the Obligations we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly under to <HI>Serve</HI> the Lord, and to shew what great Rea∣son we have to <HI>Resolve</HI> so to do.</P>
<P>(1.) <HI>GOD hath made us, and not we our selves;</HI> and hath laid us under the Strongest Obligations to Serve Him, in that He hath made us capable of a <HI>Reasonable,</HI> and a <HI>Religious</HI> Service.</P>
<P>THE Great GOD is the Author of our Be∣ing; He formed Man at first out of the Dust of the Earth, and breath'd into his Nostrils the Breath of Life. Rev. 4.11. <HI>Thou art worthy, O LORD, to receive Glory &amp; Honour &amp; Power: for Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.</HI> Now, as our Creator, GOD is our Lord Proprietor, and justly Challengeth an Abso∣lute Right and Title to our Persons, and all our Services. Rom. 11.36. <HI>Of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things.</HI> And certainly, seeing we are of the LORD as the Primary Efficient of our Being; we are under the strongest Bonds to Serve Him. There's no need of our Signing <HI>Indentures,</HI> in order to GOD's Claiming a Right to us, and our Services: for the Law of our <HI>Creation</HI> binds us in indissoluble Bonds to be the LORD's Servants. Psal. 95.6, 7. <HI>O come, let us worship &amp; how down; let us kneel before the LORD our MAKER. For He is Our GOD, and we are the Peo∣ple of His Pasture, and the Sheep of His Hand.</HI> GOD's Hand hath formed and fashion'd us; given us Life and Being: and therefore we must devote our selves unto Him. It is He that hath made us, and that hath made us Creatures capable of Knowing, Obeying, and Submitting to His Will.
<PB N="19" REF="001854_0033_0FB91CFB5644D610"/>As for the Inferiour Creatures, they are carried to their respective Ends by certain Instincts and Im∣pressions made on their Natures, without their understanding the Principles they act from, and without designing the Ends those Instincts lead to. But GOD teacheth us <HI>more than the beasts of the Earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of Heaven,</HI> Job 35.11. Men are <HI>Causes by Counsel,</HI> Free, Rational Agents, capable of understanding the Rule and Law according to which they are to act; of knowing that GOD who hath given them their Being, and of proposing to themselves an End in what they do. It is their Privilege and Honour that they are indued with such noble and exalted Powers as to be capable of an Intelligent and Ra∣tional Service, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ising GOD in an Active way, and of being employ'd in His more immediate Service. And this doth loudly Proclaim our In∣dispensible Duty to Serve the LORD with all our Powers, to do His Will and fulfil His Pleasure with Alacrity and Delight. If we transgress the Rule and Law GOD hath given us to act by, to <HI>us</HI> it is Sin; we are guilty of Rebelling against our So∣vereign LORD. Here then we see that we are oblig'd to Serve the LORD, inasmuch as. He is our Creator, and so our Owner, Act. 27.23. — <HI>Whose I am, and whom I serve.</HI> And also in that GOD hath made us thus capable of engaging in His more immediate Service.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>GOD doth continually Sustain us, and Uphold us in Life;</HI> and therefore we are obliged to Serve Him. <HI>Thou hast granted me life and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and thy Visitation hath Preserved my Spirit,</HI> Job. 10.12. His <HI>Sustentation</HI> is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as it were, a continued <HI>Creation.</HI> We have our Lives <HI>Renewed</HI> to us every Moment.
<PB N="20" REF="001854_0034_0FB91CFCD686B170"/>O then what Obligations are we under to Live to Him, and to Serve Him constantly, who is the <HI>GOD of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife, and the Length of our Days!</HI> Should we not Serve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD to whom we are beholden for every Breath we draw? Most certainly we should. It is impiously ungrateful, as well as very dangerous, to contemn the Authority, and disobey the Commands of that <HI>GOD in whose Hand our Breath is, and whose are all our ways,</HI> Dan. 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. O let us not spend the Life, which GOD con∣tinueth to us, in the Service of Satan and Lust, His avowed Enemies! Let us not Live to our <HI>selves,</HI> but to <HI>GOD,</HI> seeing He is the LORD of our Life, the Sustainer and Disposer of it! It is Just and Reasonable, that while <HI>His Everlasting Arms are underneath,</HI> to support us, and keep us from dropping into Nothing; that us Hands, and all the Powers of our Souls and Bodies, should be vigorously employ'd in His Service. We live upon GOD's Bounty, and are maintained at His Cost and Charge; O then let us Serve Him.</P>
<P>(3.) <HI>GOD gives us all the Talents which we have, capable of Improvement; and that for this End that they may be employ'd in His Service.</HI> Our Health and Strength; our Liberty, Estate, and all our Capaci∣ties, are the free Gift of GOD, and bestowed upon us for this End, that we may be capable of Serving GOD, and our Generation according to His Will. We are but <HI>Stewards</HI> of our Estates and all the Accommodations and Advantages which we enjoy. Now <HI>it is Required in Stewards, that every one be found Faithful;</HI> and take care to improve the Things they are intrusted with, in the Service of their LORD, upon His Account, and for the Advancement of His Interest. Here then
<PB N="21" REF="001854_0035_0FB91CFE58746040"/>we see what strong Bonds we are under to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the LORD with all the Talents which are com∣mitted to us. We have all of us some Talents deliver'd us by our LORD capable of being im∣prov'd in His Service. Indeed there is a great Variety in GOD's Dealing with Men upon this Account. He is Debtor to no Man; and accord∣ingly He manifests His Sovereignty in this matter. by giving to one <HI>Five Talents;</HI> to another, <HI>Two,</HI> and to another, <HI>One,</HI> as it pleaseth Him. But all are given to Men to profit withal, by being improved in the Service of their LORD and Master. A∣greeably, we read in the Parable of the Talents, <HI>As a Man travelling into a far Country, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his goods: and unto one he gave Five Talents, to another Two, — to every man according to his several ability, — Then he that had received the Five Talents, went and Traded with them,</HI> — Mat. 25.14. — It is therefore Sacrilegious Injustice to convert these to contrary uses, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> serve our Lusts with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>(4) <HI>GOD is our Saviour.</HI> And therefore we are oblig'd to Serve Him. GOD is the Saviour of <HI>All Men, especially of those that believe,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.10. GOD affords unto all, Temporal Preservations and Salvations, delivers them from many Troubles, and saves them from many Deaths. He offers Life, and Eternal Salvation to all that Live under the Gospel. And He is the Author of Eternal Salva∣tion to His Chosen People GOD saves His Peo∣ple from Sin and Death, and redeems their Souls out of all Adversity. The LORD JESUS CHRIST tho' He was in the Form of GOD, and though it not Robbery to be equal with GOD; yet H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> took upon Him the form of a Servant and be∣came
<PB N="22" REF="001854_0036_0FB91CFFD98D4E38"/>Obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cross, that so He might redeem His People from the Curse, and Purchase Grace, and Glory, and every Good Thing for them. O what Potent Obligations are they then under to Serve the LORD, who tho' the Heir and Lord of all, yet became a Servant, that He might Save them? He hath Bought them with His own Precious Blood, delivered them from the Slavery of Sin and Satan. O let these Ransomed of the LORD being delivered out of the hands of their Enemies, Serve their Glorious Redeemer and Saviour. For this End GOD rais'd up a Horn of Salvation in the House of His Servant <HI>David,</HI> that we being delivered from the hands of our Enemies, might Serve Him without fear, in Holiness and Righteousness before Him, all the days of our Life, <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.69, — 74, 75. And hath bought us when we had for∣feited our Lives into the Hands of revenging Justice. And therefore we are His, and under the strongest Obligations to Live to Him, and Serve Him with all our Powers. 1 Cor. 6.20. <HI>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify GOD in your Body, and in your Spirit, which are GOD's.</HI></P>
<P>(5.) <HI>BECAUSE it is Pleasant, and Honourable to Serve the LORD.</HI> The Slavery of Sin is most base and ignominious; but it is our Honour and Glory to Serve the LORD. It gives to the Head an Or∣nament of Grace, a Crown of Glory. It is ac∣counted a great Honour to stand before Princes, and to be taken into their Service: How much greater Honour is it to Serve that GOD, who is KING of Kings, and LORD of Lords? The Angels are GOD's Ministring Spirits, and look upon it as their highest Honour to bow before
<PB N="23" REF="001854_0037_0FB91D01574B64E8"/>His Throne, and fulfil His Pleasure. CHRIST assures us, Joh. 12.26 — <HI>If any man serve Me, him will my Father honour.</HI> Again, The service of Sin is a cruel Bondage; the yoke of Satan is an <HI>Iron</HI> yoke. He makes His Vassals to serve with <HI>Rigour.</HI> But the Yoke of CHRIST is <HI>Easy,</HI> and His Commands are <HI>not Grievous.</HI> A peaceful Se∣renity of Mind is to be enjoy'd in the Service of GOD. <HI>The ways of Wisdom are ways of Pleasantness, and all her paths are Peace,</HI> Prov. 3.17.</P>
<P>(6.) <HI>THE Service of GOD is always attended with a Glorious Recompence of Reward.</HI> They that Serve the LORD Faithfully, shall receive a Crown of Life and Glory, which fadeth not away; when they rest from their Labours, they shall enter in∣to their Masters Joy, and be for ever with the LORD, in whose Presence is fulness of Joy, at whose Right Hand are Pleasures for Evermore. Joh. 12.26. <HI>If any man serve Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there shall also my Servant be.</HI> Moreover it is a great Encouragement to us to Serve the LORD, in that He is both able and willing to afford us all needful Assistance. He's always present with us to direct and strengthen as, and help us to hold out to the End; so that <HI>our labour is not in vain in the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>HENCE we I carn, that the Service of GOD is a most Reasonable Service.</HI> Thus it is called, Rom. 12.1. — <HI>Which is your Reasonable Service.</HI> It is thus, not only because it must be perform'd <HI>Intelligently,</HI> in the Exercise of our Ra∣tional Powers: But also because there is the highest <HI>Reason</HI> for our Engaging in this Service. To Present our selves to GOD, to Consecrate and
<PB N="24" REF="001854_0038_0FB91D02D66A20F0"/>Dedicate all our Powers to Him; is the most Reasonable Thing in the World. It is the high∣est Prudence, a good Understanding have they that Serve the LORD. Such act like Men that understand themselves, the Relation they stand in to GOD, and their own truest Interest. This is most just and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quitable. To alienate our selves from GOD our Rightful LORD and Owner; is most unequal, unreasonable, and monstrous. They that do thus, break the Rules of right Rea∣son, and Violate the most Sacred Bonds: They are more vile than the Beasts that perish; more Brutish than the Ox and Ass. Remember this, and shew your selves Men, <HI>Isai.</HI> 46.8.</P>
<P>USE, II. <HI>LET what hath been said prevail with us to Resolve that we will Serve the LORD.</HI> Let One and All of us say, As for us we will Serve the LORD. And O that this Holy and Happy Reso∣lution were fixed and confirmed in each one of us! O that we might now be perswaded, to give up our selves to the LORD thro' CHRIST by the SPIRIT! We can't Serve a better Master, a more Gracious and Bountiful LORD. Why then are we so backward to Bind our selves? Why so un∣willing to give GOD His own? What! Are we unwilling? Have we the Face to say, that we will not be the LORD's? That we will not Serve the LORD our Maker, the LORD who is able to Destroy both Body and Soul in Hell, the LORD who alone can make us Happy? <HI>Be astonished O ye Heavens, and be horribly afraid</HI> at such Impiety, such Stupidity! GOD doth now invite you to List in His Service, and be∣seecheth you to Present your selves unto Him. Do not then reject so Reasonable a Request,
<PB N="25" REF="001854_0039_0FB91D06CED70AB0"/>which is back'd with the Divine Authority; but now, without delay, joyn your selves to the LORD. We had need be speedy in this Work; for we can't tell how soon our Day of Grace may be at an end. Let us then go to GOD this very Day, and be Earnest with Him to take Possession of us by His Spirit: Let us cry to Him to Sanctify us, that we may become <HI>Vessels of honour meet for our Masters use.</HI> Fall down before GOD, and Pray to Him, that for CHRIST's sake He would receive you into His Family and Service, and keep you Faithful to Him even to the Death. If we do thus devote our selves to GOD, and Resolve to be for Him and for no other; then will He advance us to the Dignity and Privi∣lege of Children, and we shall become Heirs; Heirs of GOD, and Joynt-Heirs with CHRIST. I Conclude with those Words, Mal. 3.16, 17. <HI>Then they that feared the LORD, spake often one to another, and the LORD bearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon His Name. And they shall be Mine, saith the LORD of Hosts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THE Heads of Families should Serve the LORD themselves, and take care that their Houses joyn with them in Serving the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER this Proposition we may Consider First, What is to be done by the Heads of Fa∣milies that their Houses may joyn with them in Serving the LORD. Secondly, Show the Ob∣ligations They are under thus to take care that
<PB N="26" REF="001854_0040_0FB91D08169EC198"/>their Houses joyn with them in Serving the LORD.</P>
<P>First. <HI>WHAT is to be done by the Heads of Fami∣lies that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Houses may joyn with them in Serving the LORD?</HI></P>
<P>WHAT are the Duties incumbent on such as have the Charge of Families? How should they use their Indeavours, that Religion and the Power of Godliness may be kept alive, maintained and encreased in their Houses? For Answer,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>THE Heads of Families should take care to In∣struct their Houses, and to Teach them the good Know∣tege of the LORD, His Mind &amp; Will.</HI> They should look to it that their Children and Servants be taught to know the LORD, and what it is He requires of them, that so they may Serve Him. Without Knowlege the Heart can't be good. Men are naturally alienated from the Life of Godliness, by reason of the ignorance and blindness of their Hearts. If Masters of Families would Serve the LORD themselves, and have their Houses joyn with them in this Excellent Service, they must diligently use the means of getting Knowlege themselves, and see to it that such as are com∣mitted to their Charge, be instructed in the Prin∣ciples and Mysteries of Religion. They should do what they can to teach them GOD's Statutes, and His Judgments, and take care that all need∣ful and proper helps be procured for this End. Adult Persons can't be the Disciples of CHRIST, and Serve GOD acceptably, unless they understand their Duty, and what the Service of the LORD is. For it is, as we have already heard, a <HI>Reaso∣nable</HI> Service. More particularly,</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001854_0041_0FB91D0996F889F8"/>
(1) <HI>THE Heads of Families should take care that their Children and Servants be taught to Read.</HI> The Sight is one of the Senses of Learning and Discipline. We obtain a great part of our Knowledge, and Acquaintance with things, by the help of our Eyes. And therefore if they have not opportunity and leisure themselves to teach them to Read, they should send them to School to be taught. It's a shame for Heads of Families to begrutch the Cost and Expence which they may be at in this Mat∣ter. We should take Pains with our Children and Servants, even the Meanest of them, and should be willing to Reward the Endeavours of others for their Instruction. And when they have Learned to Read, we should be ready to furnish them with Bibles, and Catechisms, and other good Books, according to their several Capacities, that they may see with their <HI>own</HI> Eyes the Great and Important Truths of Religion, and by Reading acquaint themselves with them.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>THEY should take care to Catechise their Children and Servants.</HI> This is a Great and Excellent Means of Instruction, especially for Younger Persons, and it would be both Honourable and Profitable for Persons of Riper Years to be Exercised and Improved in it. Certainly then Masters of Fami∣lies must take care that their Children and Ser∣vants Learn some good <HI>Catechism;</HI> they should see that they commit it to Memory, and also endeavour to make them understand it, that they may know the Meaning of what they Learn, and not Answer meerly by Rote, and like Par∣rots; but with Knowlege and Understanding. Now for this End we should studiously endeavour to suit
<PB N="28" REF="001854_0042_0FB91D0B1647DB80"/>and accommodate our selves to their Capacities. There must be <HI>Milk</HI> for Babes, who are <HI>unskilful in the Word of Righteousness;</HI> and <HI>Meat</HI> for those that are of Riper Years, and who <HI>by reason of use have their Senses more exercised to discern both good and evil.</HI> If we would feed Children with Knowlege and Understanding, there must be <HI>Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept,</HI> here a little, and there a little. We should endeavour that the tender Minds of our Young Ones may be season'd with the Know∣lege of GOD, and Religion; with matter for Good and Pious Thoughts; that by the Blessing of GOD the Imaginations of the thoughts of their Hearts may not be Evil. The Minds of Chil∣dren are in a great measure <HI>Tabula rasa,</HI> as clean white Paper. And we should use our Endeavours that the Laws of GOD may be written on their Hearts, and that the Truths of the Gospel may be impress'd on their Minds in their Early Years. Childhood and Youth are vanity. Their Corrupt Nature makes them very prone to receive hurtful Impressions from the Evil Examples which they see set before them, and the Wicked Prophane Speeches they hear. O be you careful to do what you can to infuse good Principles, the Saving and Purifying Truths of the Pure and Holy Law of GOD, as an Antidote against this Infection! In∣struct them in the Great Duties of Remembring their Creator in the Days of their Youth, of Hal∣lowing His Dreadful Name, of keeping the Sab∣bath Holy, of Honouring and Obeying their Pa∣rents, of Speaking the Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We are ob∣lig'd to do this, that if they are Tempted to the Vices which are contrary to these Duties, they may be able to say, they have been better Taught. GOD's Ancient People were expressly Commanded
<PB N="29" REF="001854_0043_0FB91D0C967CBE90"/>to teach their Children His Commandments: Deut. 6.6, 7. <HI>And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart. And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</HI> Now certainly the Mistresses of Families might be very Serviceable in this matter. You are very conversant with your Children, O endea∣vour to be frequently instilling into them some Divine Truth; to teach them their Duty, and to press upon them the performance of it! I might have said that as Parents should be careful to In∣struct and Catechise their Children and Servants; so they should also take Care that they attend the more Publick Opportunities of being Catechiz'd.</P>
<P>(3.) <HI>THEY should back and enforce their In∣structions with solemn Warnings and Exhortations.</HI> We should labour to make a close application of the Truths we teach them, unto their Consciences; that by the Grace of GOD, they may sink deep into their Hearts, and govern their Lives. As we should acquaint them with the Obligations they lye under to be the LORD's; so we should call upon them, earnestly to choose the LORD JEHOVAH for their GOD. As we should Ex∣plain to them the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; so we should Exhort them to give up themselves unto the LORD in that Covenant. As we must inform them of their Original Sin and Corruption; That they are by Nature <HI>Dead in trespasses and sins, and Chil∣dren of Wrath;</HI> So we must Warn them to <HI>fly the Wrath to come,</HI> and to make haste to <HI>lay hold of that Hope which is set before them.</HI> As we must Endeavour to Instruct them in the Knowlege of
<PB N="30" REF="001854_0044_0FB91D0F16BC1D38"/>our LORD JESUS CHRIST, His Person, and Offices: So we should call upon them to receive CHRIST as offer'd to them in the Gospel. Thus we should Instruct, Exhort, and Warn those un∣der our Care. And here let us remember, and seriously Consider, That those Servants who are in the lowest degree of Servitude, must not be neglected; They have Immortal Souls to Save or Lose, as well as others; They have the same Spi∣ritual Wants and Diseases, which others naturally labour of. And they are capable of being made <HI>Kings and Priests unto GOD,</HI> as well as others; and of becoming the adopted Children of GOD by Faith in CHRIST. <HI>Of a truth GOD is no Respecter of Persons; but in every Nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness is accepted with Him,</HI> Act. 10.34, 35. And thus we have Consider'd the first Particular, That the Heads of Families must take care to Teach their Houses the Knowledge of GOD, His Mind and Will. It's true, it's not in our power to give them Grace, GOD alone is able to shine into their hearts with the light of the glorious Gospel in the face of JESUS CHRIST, so as <HI>to turn them from darkness unto light; and from the power of Satan unto GOD.</HI> However, we are oblig'd to wait upon GOD in the use of these Means, if we would Serve GOD with our Houses.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>THE Heads of Families must take care that the Worship of GOD be kept up, and maintain'd in them.</HI> This they must do, if they would Serve the LORD in conjunction with their Houses. In this way they must use their Endeavours that their Houses may be <HI>Bethels,</HI> Houses of GOD, Houses devoted to His more immediate Service; That they be Temples Consecrated to the Worship of
<PB N="31" REF="001854_0045_0FB91D10594E0ED0"/>GOD. Every Family is a distinct Society, and as such, they ought to Worship GOD together, and the Heads of Families should lead herein.</P>
<P>(1.) <HI>IT is their Duty to Pray with their Families.</HI> They should offer up the Sacrifice of <HI>Prayer</HI> to GOD in their Families Morning and Evening. Their Prayer should be Set before the LORD <HI>as Incense, and the lifting up of their hands as the Evening Sacrifice,</HI> agreeable to that, <HI>Psal.</HI> 141.2. Our Houses must be Houses of <HI>Prayer,</HI> or we can't Serve GOD acceptably in them. This is one thing implyed in <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Resolution, that he would Worship GOD in his Family by <HI>Prayer,</HI> and that they should offer up their united Requests and Petitions at the Throne of Grace. The Scripture speaks of <HI>David</HI>'s blessing his Houshold, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6.20. It is said, <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>He blessed the People in the Name of the Lord of Hosts.</HI> And, v. 20. <HI>Then David returned to bless his Houshold.</HI> Men <HI>bless</HI> others, by <HI>Praying</HI> for GOD's Blessing upon them. And thus, it is pro∣bable, <HI>David</HI> blessed his Family, by <HI>Praying</HI> with, and for them. In the Morning and Infancy of the Church, Families were Churches; such was <HI>Adam</HI>'s, such <HI>Noah</HI>'s. There are Family-Wants; and therefore Masters of Families should together with their Houses, make known their Requests to GOD, for the Supply of them: There are Fa∣mily-Duties to be performed; and therefore they should join together with their Houses in Praying to GOD for Strength and Grace to do them Ac∣ceptably, to Discharge them to His Glory, and their own Comfort. They receive many Family-Mercies, and therefore it becomes them to join together in Blessing and Praising that GOD who is the Author of all our Mercies, <HI>the Father of Lights,
<PB N="32" REF="001854_0046_0FB91D11D63351B0"/>from whom cometh down every good and perfect giving.</HI> Furthermore, there are many Family-Sins, which should be Confess'd and Bewail'd; certainly then, it is the Duty of the Heads of Families to make known their Requests unto GOD, <HI>by Prayer and Supplication, with Thanksgiving.</HI> They must attend upon this Du∣ty Daily, engage in it with great Seriousness. They must look to it, that those who are under their Care and Inspection, give due Attendance at the Times for Prayer; and choose the most Convenient Seasons for the Discharge of this Duty. They should study so to order their Secular Affairs, that they may not interfere with, or crowd out this necessary Duty, but that they may have due and suitable Time for the Discharge of it. Fervent Prayer is an Excellent Mean to keep true Piety Alive and Flourishing; and it is a considerable and essential Part of that Homage which we owe to the Blessed GOD. And therefore, if this Du∣ty be neglected, we do not Serve the LORD with our Houses as we are bound to do.</P>
<P>(2.) <HI>THEY should Read the Scriptures with their Families.</HI> As we must <HI>Speak</HI> to GOD and hum∣bly call upon Him by Prayer, so we should at∣tentively <HI>Hear</HI> what GOD the LORD hath to say unto us. It's therefore very Proper to join with Prayer the Reading a Portion of the Word of GOD in the Family. This is a Part of Divine Worship, and it ought to be a Part of our Daily Worship in our Houses. We read, 2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by inspiration of GOD, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness.</HI> We have in these Oracles of GOD the Rules laid down according to which we must Walk, if we would
<PB N="33" REF="001854_0047_0FB91D13563EE2A0"/>have our Ways please the LORD, and Serve Him Acceptably. Here we are Taught what our Duty is, and to whom we must go for Strength to Perform it. I might here say, that if some Practical Exposition were made use of, it would be of good Advantage.</P>
<P>TO these Particulars it might be added, That the <HI>Singing of Psalms</HI> is a Pleasant and Profitable Exercise, which should be attended, where there's Ability to Perform it.</P>
<P>I shall here take occasion to say that the Heads of Families should Worship GOD in Secret; and they must call upon all under their Care to do so too, and allow them convenient time for Secret Duties. Each Member of the Family come to years of Discretion, must Worship GOD apart, as well as in conjunction with the Family. Our Saviour commands, Mat. 6.6. <HI>But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret,</HI> — It should be their care that such as are well-disposed in their Families, may not have just reason to complain that they are not allow'd time to Pray, and Read the Word of GOD in Secret. Our Servants are not so <HI>ours,</HI> but they are the LORD's still, and GOD expects that part of their time be daily devoted to His more immediate Service; so that if we refuse to grant convenient time for such Duties, we rob GOD of His due.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>HEADS of Families should take care that their Families do Sanctify the LORD's-Day, and keep it Holy.</HI> If they would have their Families Serve the LORD, they must do so. In the Fourth Com∣mandment
<PB N="34" REF="001854_0048_0FB91D14D86BCCF0"/>it is expresly said, Exod. 20.10. <HI>Thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daugh∣ter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattel, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.</HI> Masters of Families should see to it, that their Children and Servants Rest from their Worldly business, and Employment, on the LORD's-Day, and spend that Time in the Publick and Private Exercises of GOD's Worship; except so much as is to be taken up in the works of Necessity, and Mercy. They should see to it that their Houses be set in Order, and that their Secular and Worldly Bu∣siness be Seasonably laid aside; that so they and their Houses may keep the Sabbath as a Day of Holy <HI>Rest</HI> unto the LORD. Thus they must <HI>Re∣member</HI> the Sabbath Day, to keep it Holy. Very Solemn are the Precepts and Exhortations recorded, Jer. 17.20, 21, 22. <HI>Hear ye the word of the LORD, — Thus saith the LORD, Take heed to your selves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath-Day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem. Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath-Day, neither do ye any work; but hallow ye the Sabbath-Day.</HI> They must see that they do not <HI>Command</HI> or <HI>Allow</HI> their Servants to <HI>Work</HI> on the LORD's-Day. And it is their Duty also to use their Authority to Restrain them from <HI>Play</HI> and vanity; yea, from such <HI>Re∣creations</HI> as may be Lawful on other days. The governours of Families should take care that they with their Houses attend upon the Publick Worship of GOD on the LORD's-Day. As they should take care that they attend the Duties of Pri∣vate Worship in the Family: so they should provide that none under their Roof do needlesly absent them∣selves from the House of GOD, and forfake the Assembling of themselves together to Worship
<PB N="35" REF="001854_0049_0FB91D16F26A4000"/>GOD with the Congregation of His People. If Heads of Families allow their Children or Ser∣vants to tarry at home, when they ought to go to the Publick Assembly; they do not do what in them lyes to make their Housholds Serve the LORD. It is Scandalous for Children or Ser∣vants to be suffered to absent themselves from the Publick Worship of GOD, when Necessity doth not require it. And if such as have the Charge of Families would take up Joshua's Resolution, they must exert their Authority to oblige them to wait upon GOD in His House, and see that their behaviour there be decent and reverent; and not profane and ludicrous.</P>
<P>USE. <HI>THOSE of us that are Masters of Families have cause to be Humbled for our Defects and Short∣comings in this great Duty; that we have been no more careful to engage our Housholds in Serving the LORD.</HI> Who of us can say that we have not been wanting in this Matter? In many things all of us have offended, and fallen short of our Duty. We have not been so careful to walk in our Houses with a perfect Heart as we ought to have been; to dwell with our Families as Men of Knowlege. Our Lips have not preserved Knowledge, and communicated it so much as they ought to have done. We have not been so fervent and frequent in our Exhortations and Warnings as we ought to have been. And must we not confess that we have been remiss in maintaining Family-Worship, in the Life and Power of it. Alas, have we not been Formal and Indifferent in Praying in our Fa∣milies, and Reading the Word of GOD to them? Have we not been negligent in our Observation of the LORD's-Day? Have not the Cares, and
<PB N="36" REF="001854_0050_0FB91D17D6997238"/>Pleasures and Business of this World, in a great measure, shu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out Family-Religion? Certainly, the best of us have reason to be humbled before the LORD upon this Account, and to say as, Psal. 130.3. <HI>If thou LORD shouldst mark iniquities; O LORD, who shall stand?</HI> Let us then lye down in the Dust, and abase our selves before the LORD for our Family-Sins. Let us Cry to Him to Sprinkle our Houses with the Blood of the True Pascal Lamb, which taketh away the Sin of the World.</P>
<P>AND let us now be Exhorted to be active and diligent in Reforming what has been amiss; and to be more zealous in promoting the Exercise of Family-Religion for the future. Let us now Renew and Strengthen this holy Resolution, <HI>As for us, and our houses, We will Serve the LORD.</HI> Let us resolve with <HI>David</HI> in that Psalm, which as one observes, may be called the Housholder's Psalm, 101.2. <HI>I will behave my self wisely in a perfect way; O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk with∣in my house with a perfect heart.</HI> Let us endeavour to grow and abound more and more in Family-Religion. Let us now be more studious to get acquainted with GOD, His Mind and Will. And also be ready to take pains to instruct and teach our Families, our Children, and Servants. O let it be our Care that they may be Fed, not only with <HI>Bread,</HI> but also with Spiritual <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Understanding. It is Written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD.</HI> O let us not neglect the Souls, the Precious, the Immortal Souls of our Children, and Servants, and other Relatives; while we are careful to provide for their Bodies! O let
<PB N="37" REF="001854_0051_0FB91D1A133F98D8"/>us not be so Solicitous to lay up Estates for our Children, and to provide pleasant Accommodati∣ons for our Families; as to obtain the Ever∣lasting Mercies of the New Covenant, which in all things is well ordered and sure. Let us take care to offer up fervent Prayers for, and with our Families. Let our houses be more than ever Houses of Prayer. Then we may hope, that GOD who is the high and lofty One, that dwells in the high and holy Place; That GOD, whose especial Presence is the Glory and Blessedness of Heaven it self: I say that GOD will come down and dwell with us, and fill our houses with the Glory of His Spiritual Presence. O when will GOD thus come unto us! Then we might hope that GOD would create upon the dwelling Places in our Zion <HI>a Cloud and Smoke by day; and the Shining of a flaming Fire by Night;</HI> and that we and our houses should be the Saved and Blessed of the LORD.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>THE Heads of Families should take care to use that power and authority which GOD hath given them, to encourage true Piety; and to Suppress Vice in their Houses.</HI> Its Observed that Masters of Fa∣milies, in the Infancy of the World, before Fa∣milies Combined and Associated into larger Soci∣eties, were both Priests and Kings in their Houses. Such its supposed was <HI>Noah,</HI> such <HI>Abraham.</HI> Now though the Authority of Heads of Families is not in our Day in all respects Equal to what it was supposed to have been then; and Masters of Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lies must beware of wresting the Sword of Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce out of the Hand of the Magistrate, who bears it by Divine Appointment, and see that they do not Usurp more Authority than is allowed
<PB N="38" REF="001854_0052_0FB91D1AD6F3C738"/>them. Yet I say, It's most certain that GOD doth invest them with power and authority over their Families by an immutable, and unchangable Law: The Fifth Commandment expressly sayes, <HI>Thou shalt honour thy Father and thy Mother.</HI> Children are Commanded to Obey their Parents; Servants, their Masters: Eph. 6.1, &amp; 5. <HI>Children Obey your Parents in the Lord; for this is right.</HI> 5. v. <HI>Servants, be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ.</HI> The light and law of Nature taught the Heathen, that every <HI>Man should hear Rule in his own House.</HI> Now seeing GOD hath clothed Heads of Families with Power, they ought to improve their Power for the countenancing, and encouraging Religion and the Fear of GOD in their Houses. For as they derive their Authority from GOD; so they should employ it to His Honour and Glory. They should in their Fami∣lies, <HI>be a Terror to evil doers, and a Praise to them that do well.</HI> Thus they ought to back and en∣force their Instructions and Exhortations, by their Authority; and see that they maintain Family-Discipline in their Houses. GOD gives that Ho∣nourable Character and Encomium of <HI>Abraham:</HI> Gen. 18.19. <HI>For I know him, that he will command his Children and his Houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do Justice and Judge∣ment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.</HI></P>
<P>THEY should not only <HI>Teach</HI> and Instruct; but also <HI>Command</HI> their Houshold to Serve the LORD, as being Persons in Authority. Masters of Families should Charge those under their Care, their Children and Servants to keep the Com∣mandments.
<PB N="39" REF="001854_0053_0FB91D1D1D7ABCD8"/>To hallow GOD's Name, and to abstain from profane Cursing; To beware of calling wicked Names, and of speaking obscene and filthy Words. To abstain from Play, and Idleness on the Lords Day. To Keep good Or∣ders in the Family, by duely attending on Fa∣mily-Worship. They should also Command them to avoid Vicious and Profane Company, and to keep themselves from such Places where there is danger of their being corrupted in their Manners. We should as there is need of it, Command them to beware of every thing that hath a Tendency to De∣bauch them. Masters of Families should use their endeavours, that Evil Customs may not get Foot∣ing, and prevail among us. If instead of this, they Allow and Indulge their Children and Ser∣vants, or any under their Authority, in any thing wherein they serve the Devil and their L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s; if instead of Prohibiting them, they give them Leave to be cut at Unseasonable Hours, and that in Places of great Temptation, where they are in Danger of having their Lusts irritated and infla∣med; if they do thus, they are egregiously defective in their Duty; for it is our Duty as much as may be to prevent Sin. And therefore Masters of Families when they see their Children or Servants Tempted to Sin, and in Danger of running into any Excess; They should lay their Commands upon them to keep themselves from the accursed thing, which GOD's Soul hateth, and their Souls should abhor. When they see them in Danger, they should Authoritatively declare to them, that such and such things as are contrary to the Mind and Will of GOD, are also displeasing to them; and that if they do them, it must be upon their Peril.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="001854_0054_0FB91D1DDE6A6850"/>
AGAIN, Heads of Families should use their Authority to Reprove their Children and Servants for their Sins and Follies, and to Correct them, if need be. As they ought to Command them to abstain from Sin; so also to Reprove and Correct them for their Sins, as need requires. They have power to affix a Penalty as a Sanction to their Commands, and to put it in Execution, in case of Disobedience. In this way they ought to bear their Testimony against the iniquities of their Children and Servants, as the matter may require. <HI>Eli</HI> is articled against in the Word of GOD, and threatned for his negligence herein, 1 Sam. 3.13. <HI>For I have told him, that I will judge his House for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</HI> Heads of Families don't do what in them lies to restrain and suppress Vice in their Houses, if they are not careful to Chastise and Punish their Chil∣dren and Servants when found guilty. Its their Duty in this way to improve their Power for that GOD who hath given it them; and so to <HI>put away iniquity far from their Tabernacles.</HI> They must have no Fellowship with any unfruitful work of Darkness, which they see any in their Families chargeable with: but should Discountenance it, Reprove it, Frown upon it; that so if they have any that will not be subject to the Laws of GOD for Conscience sake, and a holy Fear of His Wrath; that yet they may by the Blessing of GOD, be restrained from the Open Violation of His Laws, for fear of present Punishment: Prov. 13.24. <HI>He that spareth his rod, hateth his son: but he that loveth him, chastneth him betimes.</HI> It's true, Heads of Families should beware of abusing their power; they should take heed to themselves that

They must not, by undue, Severities, <HI>Provoke, their Children to Wrath.</HI> They must <HI>forbear threatning</HI> their Servants after a Cruel Manner; and see that they be not Un∣merciful in punishing them. They should Study so to manage themselves in this Matter, as to give con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cing Evidence that it is the <HI>Glory of GOD,</HI> and the <HI>benefit</HI> of the offender that they aim at in their Reproofs and Corrections, and not the gratifying any exorbitant Passion.</P>
<P>AGAIN, They should use their Authority to compe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such to leave their Houses, as are irre∣claimably wicked, and refuse to subject themselves to Family-Government. Such as are Openly Vi∣cious and Disorderly, that are Sons of Belial, who shake off the Yoke from off their Necks; that obstinately refuse to hear the Counsels and Warn∣ings which are given them; and go on in their iniquity, in spite of Correction: They ought not to be suffered to dwell in our Houses, lest others be infected and poysoned with their evil Examples. <HI>David</HI> comes to that Resolution, in <HI>Isal.</HI> 101. which seems to treat chiefly of his Management of him∣self in his Family: Verse 4. <HI>A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person,</HI> Verse 7. <HI>He that worketh deceit, shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</HI> It becomes Heads of Families to use their Endeavours to get and employ such Servants as shall be ready and willing to joyn with them in Serving the LORD. <HI>Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall Serve me.</HI> And if their
<PB N="42" REF="001854_0056_0FB91D2197B8FF80"/>Servants, or others that sojourn with them, are open enemies to GOD and Religion, they should Purge their Houses of them. It is their Duty in this way to show their Hatred of Vice, when other means prove ineffectual.</P>
<P>AND then, as it is the Duty of Heads of Fa∣milies to use their Power to discountenance Vice; so also to encourage Virtue and true Piety in their Families. They must be a <HI>Praise</HI> and Incourage∣ment to them that do well; as well as a <HI>Terror</HI> to evil doers. Such as are Heads of Families should improve their Influence and Authority to countenance their Children and Servants, and all under their Roof in that which is Pious and Honest, and of good Report. <HI>GOD's Countenance beholds the Upright</HI> with delight and complacency; And they must be imitators of GOD herein; they should give such as fear the LORD, some peculiar marks and testimonies of their Favour: and shew them, that they are well pleased to see them take care to Serve GOD, and to walk worthy of the LORD. As they should endeavour to help such forward in the Service of GOD, by their Instructions; so also to use their Authority to protect and strengthen them in the Service of our common LORD; and not suffer any <HI>to harm them,</HI> to reproach or scoff at them, <HI>because they are followers of that which is good.</HI> Thus if Heads of Families would Serve the LORD with their Houses, they must use the Authority GOD hath given them, to incourage true Piety; and to suppress Vice; That so by the blessing of GOD, their Houses may be the Habitations of Righteous∣ness; and that wickedness may not dwell with them.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="43" REF="001854_0057_0FB91D23D7BE04A8"/>
<HI>HEADS of Families must take care that the Business which their Families are employed in, be Lawful; and should use their endeavours, that Holiness to the LORD, be written on their Houshold Affairs.</HI> If we would maintain the Fear and Service of GOD in our Houses; We must be careful that the Affairs and Worldly Business which our Families, Children and Servants are employed in, be lawfull and useful: Such, as in the diligent Attendance upon it, they may Serve their Generation according to the Will of GOD, and be blessings to the Communities and Societies they belong to.</P>
<P>ITS the Duty of Heads of Families to look to it that all under their care be employed in some <HI>Business;</HI> and that they be not suffered to spend their time in Idleness and Vanity. We must not let them be all the Day Idle: For <HI>Idleness</HI> is in it self a great Sin, and is the cause of many other ini∣quities. When Persons are Idle, Satan will find work for them to do. Certainly then, If we would Serve the LORD with our Houses, we must see that ours be employ'd in some Business, according to their several Capacities.</P>
<P>AND then we should see that their Business be <HI>Honest</HI> and <HI>Lawful.</HI> We must beware that we do not seek a Maintenance for our Selves, and Fami∣lies by unjust Practices. And we must not by our Influence, draw our Servants to joyn with us in any Unlawful way of dealing. If we do, our Houses will deserve rather to be called the <HI>Taberna∣cles of Robbers, than the Dwellings of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>AND the Heads of Families must endeavour that
<PB N="44" REF="001854_0058_0FB91D266CC09E88"/>their Secular Affairs be attended in a right <HI>Manner.</HI> As they should every Day Pray for a blessing on their lawful Business; so they should take care that it be Attended in such a <HI>Manner</HI> that they may reasonably look for a blessing upon it. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Callings which are in themselves lawful, may be greatly abused to the dishonour of GOD, and the differvice of Religion. Masters of Families should therefore Watch against the Temptations which they, or their Servants may be exposed to in their Par∣ticular Callings. They should take care to be just and honest in their dealing themselves: And as much as may be, look to it that their Servants be so too. In a word, they must Study to keep their Employments under such a Regulation, as that they may be Subservient to the Glory and Ho∣nour of GOD. Thus they should endeavour that Holiness be written on their Houshold Affairs, if they would Serve the LORD with their Houses.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>MASTERS of Families should use their endeavours that their Children and Servants who are come to Years of Discretion, may be brought to give up themselves to the LORD in his Covenant, and Publickly to pro∣fess their Subjection to Him.</HI> Masters ought to yield up themselves to the LORD, confess His Name, and openly profess their Subjection to Him. And they must endeavour to prepare those that are under their care for this Duty also. They should employ their care and diligence, that their Servants may become the Disciples of the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and that they may come regularly, to partake in the Privileges of the New Covenant. Masters of Families should be earnest with GOD for His Spirit and Grace to be poured out upon themselves; and wait upon Him in the diligent use
<PB N="45" REF="001854_0059_0FB91D27966B5588"/>of means, that they may obtain that Character which is given of <HI>Zacharias</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Luk. 1.6. <HI>And they were both Righteous before GOD, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the LORD blameless.</HI> They should likewise take care that their Children be seasonably offer'd to GOD in Baptism, the initiating Seal of the Covenant. And then, as they grow up to Years of Discretion, they should instruct them in the Nature, and Design of this Ordinance; and press upon them the Obligations which their being made partakers of this Privi∣lege laies them under to be the LORD's. Thus they should <HI>bring them up in the Nurture and Admo∣nition of the LORD.</HI> But we have already heard something concerning Family Instruction. They should call upon them to Renew their Covenant with GOD in a Solemn Manner, and by their own Publick consent to the Terms of the Cove∣nant of Grace, joyn themselves to the LORD, and to His Church and People; that so Dedi∣cating themselves to the LORD, they may be admitted Members in full Communion, as we commonly speak. And thus if they have any in their, Families under their care, that are Adult Persons, and have not enjoyed the Privilege of Baptism in their Infancy; they should give dili∣gence in the use of all proper Means, to prepare them for this Ordinance, looking to GOD for His Blessing on their Endeavours. In this manner they should Endeavour that they and their Hou∣ses may be the LORD's, truly Devoted and Dedicated to His Service, and visibly in Covenant with Him; that they may openly acknowlege the LORD JEHOVAH, FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST, for their GOD.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="46" REF="001854_0060_0FB91D2A0FD91160"/>
<HI>HEADS of Families must take care to set a good Example; and to walk in their Houses in the diligent and conscientious Attendance upon the Duties, which the LORD their GOD requires of them; whether Personal, or Relative.</HI> As they must Instruct their Families, and Charge them to keep the Com∣mandments of the LORD; so they should <HI>go before them,</HI> and <HI>Lead</HI> in the way of Rightecusness and Holiness; That they may be able to call upon their Children and Servants to <HI>follow them, as they follow CHRIST.</HI> Masters should be Watchful over themselves, and take care to <HI>Walk in their Houses with a perfect heart,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> resolves he would do, <HI>Psal.</HI> 101.2. Among the Methods of Instruction, the way of Teaching by good <HI>Ex∣ample,</HI> is justly esteemed very Excellent. And no doubt, hath been often found very successful. Indeed verbal Instructions and Admonitions with∣out this, will not be likely to avail. For how can we expect that GOD's Blessing should accom∣nany our Endeavours to Teach our Children and Servants to Know and Serve the LORD: if we our selves neglect to Serve Him, and yield Obe∣dience to His Commands? How can we hope that our Calls, and Exhortations, and Warnings, should have any prevailing force upon the minds of our Relatives, if they see that we disregard GOD's Commands our selves, and in our Practice declare that we reject them? <HI>Actions</HI> speak louder than <HI>Words.</HI> And therefore if we allow our selves in Wicked Courses; our Evil <HI>Exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> will be likely to do more to <HI>Corrupt</HI> our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>milies, than our Instructions and Exhortations will do to <HI>Reform</HI> them. Suppose Heads of Families should Instruct their Children and Servants, and call upon
<PB N="47" REF="001854_0061_0FB91D2B56EE77D8"/>them to Fear and Serve the LORD, and tell them the Obligations which they are under so to do. Sup∣pose they should call upon them to Secure an Interest in CHRIST, and acquaint them with the absolute Necessity they stand in of the Favour of GOD, and a Title to the Blessings of the New Covenant; yet if they were not at all concern'd themselves for an Interest in CHRIST and the Blessings of the Covenant; their Children and Ser∣vants would be ready to despise such Calls as coming from them. Suppose they should Pray, and Read the Scriptures in their Families; yet if their Lives give the Lie to their Requests, and Acknowledgments, manifested in their Prayers; if their Practice be a contradiction to the Rules of the Gospel, and opposite to them; this would be a great damp and discouragement to Family Religion; while they deny the Power of it, at the same time when they make some Essays to keep up the Form. Suppose they should Command their Children and Servants to keep good Hours, and to abstain from such Places and Company, as have a Tendency to Infect and Defile them; yet if they themselves stay out late at Taverns, or other Places of Temptation; this would breed great Disorder and Confusion in their Families, and be a dreadful Hinderance to the Business of Family Religion. Suppose they should Command their Children and Servants not to Swear and Curse; not to Prophane the LORD's-Day; not to Steal, and the like: yet if they allow them∣selves in these Abominations; what can be ex∣pected, but that their Houses should be the Dwel∣ling-Places of Iniquity, and that even the External Form of Religion should in a little time be wholly laid aside Certainly then, Masters of
<PB N="48" REF="001854_0062_0FB91D2D911BA768"/>Families must take care to set a Good and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Example; if they would Serve the LORD in and with their Families. They must be careful that the Rules and Laws of the Word of GOD be Copied out in their Conversation; and that their Instructions be exemplified in their Life and Practice.</P>
<P>TO Conclude, Let us Pray to GOD to pour out His Spirit from on High, to revive Family-Religion which seems to be under visible Decays and Languishments. Let us be Earnest with GOD <HI>to pour out His Spirit on our Seed, and His Blessing on our Offspring.</HI> Let us Sanctify our Houses by searching for the <HI>Old Leaven,</HI> and casting it out. If we Serve the LORD in our Families with In∣tegrity and Uprightness of Heart; if we Wor∣ship Him with Reverence and godly Fear; then GOD will choose our Houses for His Habitation, and Say; This is My Rest, here will I Dwell, for I have desired it.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>THE Second thing under this Proposition is, to Shew the Obligations which Masters of Families are under to take care that their Houses joyn with them in Serving the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>NOW it will appear that Heads of Families are under very strong Obligations to use their best Endeavours that Religion may grow and flourish in their Families, in that their Houses may be Devoted to the Fear and Service of GOD, If we Consider,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>THE Charge of Families is in a pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s manner committed to the Hends of them, by GOD.</HI> The
<PB N="49" REF="001854_0063_0FB91D2E561B87D8"/>Great GOD doth in a peculiar manner betrust Masters with the Care and Management of their Houses. He cloatheth them with their Authority; gives them the distinguishing advantages which they enjoy, to promote Religion; and accordingly He doth most justly Command them to look to it that their Houses Serve the LORD. Its the Will of GOD, That Masters of Families should diligent∣ly Instruct those that are under their Care, in the <HI>Good Knowlege of the LORD.</HI> That they should teach them to fear the LORD, and command them to keep His Statutes and His Judgments. And that they should be careful to maintain the Wor∣ship of GOD in their Houses. Indeed its the duty of all and every one in their several Places, and according to their several Capacities, to seek the advancement of true Piety in the Houses where they dwell. But then its peculiarly incum∣bent on Heads of Families. GOD hath set them over their Families for this end. GOD hath made them <HI>Overseers</HI> to inspect their Houses, and they <HI>must watch over them as they that must give account.</HI> GOD hath put you into this Relation, and it is with a Charge to improve it to His Glory, and Honour, and the Advancement of the Interests of His Kingdom. When GOD causeth your Houses to grow, and graclously giveth you Children, the Voice of His Providence to you is, Take these Children, and Educate them for Me; Teach them the Reverence and Obedience they owe to Me their Heavenly Father; That they may be Dutiful Children. When you have Servants, The Voice of GOD's Providence to you is, Take these Servants, and endeavour to teach them the Service which the LORD their GOD requires of them, the Mystery of their General, as well as
<PB N="50" REF="001854_0064_0FB91D2FD702F208"/>of their Particular Calling. Show them the Bonds and Obligations which they are under to Serve the LORD; and endeavour that they may be delivered from the Slavery of Satan, the Bon∣dage of their Lusts; and become the LORD's Freemen, the Faithful and Obedient Servants of our Common LORD and Master. This is the Voice of GOD's Providence, as well as of His Word. The Relation they stand in to their Fa∣milies, as it commands respect and Obedience from those under their Government: so it also lays them under peculiar Obligations to Honour GOD, by taking care that their Houses Serve Him. They are in a peculiar manner <HI>yours,</HI> and there∣fore you are under the greater Obligations to take care that they become the <HI>LORD</HI>'s.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>IF Masters take no care that their Houses may Serve the LORD; then the Iniquity of their Houses will be laid to their Charge; and they Them∣selves with their Families will be exposed to the Wrath and Curse of a Jealous GOD.</HI> We are guilty be∣fore GOD, and become Partakers with others in their Sins, when we do not according to the Relation we sustain, and the Power and Influence we have, seek to keep them from Iniquity, and do not bear a due Testimony against their Sins. <HI>If our Children or Servants make themselves vile, and we restrain them not;</HI> if we suffer them to go on in their evil ways, without Warning, Reproof and needful Correction; we become guilty before GOD; the gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and defilement of their, abo∣minations will cleave unto us. And we shall have reason to fear that Wrath will come down upon us, and our Houses. As it did upon <HI>Eli's</HI> House, 1. Sam. 3.11 <HI>to</HI> 14. <HI>And the LORD said to Samuel,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="001854_0065_0FB91D315690F658"/><HI>Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the Ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. In that day, I will perform against Eli, all things which I have spoken concerning his House: when I begin I will also make an end. For I have told him, that I will judge his House for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his Sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. And therefore I have Sworn unto the House of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's House shall not be purged with Sacrifice nor Offering for ever.</HI> If Masters do not take care to keep up the Wor∣ship of GOD in their Houses; to command their Children and Servants to keep GOD's Statutes; they may expect that the Curse of GOD will enter into their Houses, and sooner or later, consume them and their Families. We read of <HI>a Flying Roll,</HI> Zech. 5.1. And then its said, <HI>This is the Curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole Earth,</HI> ver. 3, 4. <HI>I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of Hosts, and it shall enter into the House of the Thief, and into the House of him that Sweareth falsely by my Name: and it shall remain in the midst of his House, and shall consume it, with the Timber thereof, and the Stones thereof.</HI> Now we rob GOD of His due all the while we take no care to Serve the LORD our selves, and to use our en∣deavours that our Houses may joyn with us in Serving the LORD. If we neglect to maintain the Worship of GOD in our Houses, we rob Him of the Offerings of Prayer and Praise, which are His due. We rob Him of His Glory while we indulge abominable Iniquities in our Houses. Now this is the way to have the Curse of GOD spoken of in this Text, lie upon us, and upon ours. Such as live like Hea∣then in their Houses, have reason to fear that
<PB N="52" REF="001854_0066_0FB91D32D6612810"/>Curse should fall upon them, Psal. 79.6. <HI>Pour out thy wrath upon the Heathen that have not know thee, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.</HI> Sometimes the Houses <HI>of the wicked are safe from fear, neither is the rod of GOD upon them,</HI> Job 21.9. They are carnally secure, and prosper upon Tem∣poral Accounts. But then this is one of the most dreadful Judgments, to be suffered to go on in Sin without the Checks and Restraints of GOD's Pro∣vidence. Spiritual Plagues are the worst of Plagues. Certainly then the Masters of Families are oblig'd to use their endeavours that their Houses may Serve the LORD, as they would hope to preserve them from the blasting Curse of a Jealous GOD. And then if Masters are neg∣ligent in their Duty, and do not bear Testimony against Sin in their Families; they will pull down an heavy load of Guilt on themselves, and day themselves open to the Righteous Displeasure and Fiery Indignation of GOD. If our Children or Servants perish through our Criminal negli∣gence; if we take no care for their Instruction in Righteousness; their Blood will be required at our Hands. And if we die without Repentance they will rise up in Judgment against us, in the Great and Terrible Day of the LORD, when we and they must stand before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST to give an account of the things done in the body, and to receive our final Sentence. And O how terrible will it be to have our Children accuse us then, and say, You were cruel to our Immortal Souls, and never had any true regard to our Spiritual Welfare: You were more care∣ful to teach us the vain Fashions, and evil Customs of the World; Than to instruct us in the Principles of Religion, and to use your endeavours that we
<PB N="53" REF="001854_0067_0FB91D3457AF1858"/>might be brought to the Saving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST: You were more Solicitous to have us adorned with those accomplishments which might recommend us to the esteem of the World; Than to have us adorned with the Graces of the Spirit, and with the Beauties and Glories of the inward Man; you allowed us to Serve divers Lusts and Pleasures; but never call'd upon us Seriously, to Serve the LORD our Maker. You were more con∣cern'd to get Estates for us, and that we should make a figure in the World; Than to obtain the Blessings of the New Covenant for us. O how shall we be able to lift up our heads at the Great Day, If our Children should accuse us after this manner! Alas! We shall not be able to stand in the Judgment, but shall call to the Rocks and Moun∣tains to fall on us, and hide us from the wrath of GOD and the Lamb. Certainly then, it neces∣sarily concerns Heads of Families to give diligence that their Children and Servants, and all under their Care may be brought to Acknowlege GOD as their GOD, and to Serve Him. We must en∣deavour by the Grace of GOD, to do our duty in this Matter, as we would hope to give up our account with joy, and not with grief.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>THIS is the way to obtain the gracious Presence of GOD with us in our Houses, and to have His Blessing upon us.</HI> If we take Care to Serve GOD in our Houses, then He will come down and be in the midst of us, to bless us. If we in this way open the doors of our Houses, and give the blessed GOD admittance? He will come in, and make His Abode with us. <HI>Lift up your heads O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in.</HI> CHRIST doth as it were knock
<PB N="54" REF="001854_0068_0FB91D35D99A5240"/>at our doors, and say, <HI>Open to Me!</HI> And shall we not bid Him welcome? Should not Heads of Fa∣milies make all needful Preparation for His Enter∣tainment, by Purging their Houses from Sin, and by maintaining the Worship of GOD in them. The Presence of the Glorious GOD will be an abundant Recompence for all the care and pains we can take to receive and entertain Him. We read, Rev. 22.12. <HI>And behold, I come quckly; and my Reward is with me.</HI> — This is true with respect to CHRIST's approaches to His People in this Life, when He manifests His Gracious Presence with them, and passeth before them in acts of especial Kindness and Favour. When He comes into our Hearts, or into our Houses to dwell with us: He will not come empty-handed; No, But He will bring Spiritual and Heavenly Blessings with Him; The Blessings of the Upper and the Nether Springs. If we and our Houses Serve the LORD, then will GOD Bless us, Delight in us, and Rejoyce over us to do us good. Prov. 3.33. <HI>The Curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</HI> Now its the Blessing of GOD that Buildeth the House, that Establisheth it, that Enricheth it. O how plea∣santly, how joyfully might we live, had we more of the Presence of GOD with us, and more of the Divine Blessing upon us? They will have light in their Dwellings, who have the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> dwelling with them. They shall see the want of no good thing, of nothing which Infi∣nite. Wisdom shall see needful and proper for them, who receive GOD into their Hearts and Houses; That GOD, <HI>from whom cometh down every good and perfect giving.</HI> O how comfortable, how desirable is it, to have that GOD keep House with us,
<PB N="55" REF="001854_0069_0FB91D375700C758"/>who is the GOD of Peace, the GOD of Order, the GOD of Love? This would sweeten the Troubles we meet with in the Flesh; lessen and lighten the Burthens and Difficulties of our wea∣risome Pilgrimage. GOD will protect and defend such Houses; and the secret of His Presence shall be as a Pavilion to them. Psal. 91.10. <HI>There shall no Evil befal thee, neither shall any Plague come nigh thy Dwelling.</HI> Nothing but what GOD will Over-rule for good; they shall have Health in their Habitations, if GOD seeth it best. However He will visit such as Serve Him, when in Sickness, and make their Beds for them in the time of their Languishing. He will Crown them with His Favour, and Command a Blessing on their Outward Enjoyments. 2 Sam. 6.11, 12. <HI>And the Ark of the Lord continued in the House of Obed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edom the Gittite, three Mouths: and the Lord blessed Obed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edom, and all his houshold. And it was told King David, saying, The Lord hath blessed the house of Obed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the Ark of God. So David went and brought up the Ark of God from the House of Obed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edom, into the City of David with gladness.</HI> He will Bless such Houses; and those whom GOD Blesseth, shall be Blessed indeed. O how much doth it concern Heads of Families then to devote themselves and Families to the Service of the Blessed GOD! How much is it their Interest to promote true Religion in their Houses!</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IT will appear, that Heads of Families are under strong Obligations to Serve the Lord with their Houses, if we consider the many Mercies which they and their Houses daily receive from GOD.</HI> GOD daily loads us with His Benefits. We are Indebted to Him for ma∣ny
<PB N="56" REF="001854_0070_0FB91D399646CDF8"/>Personal, and for many Family-Mercies; And shall we not Praise Him with our Families? Shall we not endeavour, that our Houses may be Devoted to the Honour of that GOD, who is our Benefactor? Are we and our Families Pre∣served in the Night-Watches by that GOD who is the Watchman of Israel, that never <HI>slumbreth nor sleepeth?</HI> Have we taken Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in Sleep, and not been Distressed with the Terrors of the Night? Certainly then, when we see the Faces of each other in Peace, it becomes us to join together in Praising the Name of the Lord for the Mercies of the Night. Doth GOD <HI>preserve our going out, and coming in,</HI> in the Day Time, when Man goeth forth to his Labour? Doth He make our Business to Prosper? Undoubtedly then, we are obliged to offer up the Evening Sacrifice of Praise, and to Bless the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Mercies and Preservations of the Day. Doth GOD Spread a Table for us Daily? Certainly then, it's our Duty, as to ask His Blessing upon the Food He gives us; so also to return Thanks to Him, and Praise His Name when we have Eaten and are full. And though it be not required that we should be very long in Craving a Blessing, or Returning Thanks; yet certainly it becomes us to do it with Reverence and with hearts devoutly affected with the Mercies of GOD; and not with a trifling Air, as if we were Praying to, or Blessing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Idol. Further∣more, Doth GOD from time to time preserve our Houses from Fire, and other Desolating Judgments; doth our Great Land-Lord who's is the Earth and the Fulness thereof, give us pleasant com∣fortable Dwellings, and not turn us out of Doors; Certainly this is a strong Obligation to engage us to Serve Him in, and with our Houses. Doth
<PB N="57" REF="001854_0071_0FB91D3B161FA2A0"/>GOD fill our Houses with good things, give us many Conveniencies and Desirable Accommodati∣ons; And shall we forget and despise this GOD? O base Ingratitude! Doth GOD give us Health and Peace, in our Habitations; are our Houses in a good measure, safe from fear: O then we should Serve the LORD with joy, alacrity and delight. The Mercies of GOD bestowed on our Families, are an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dearing, and a very strong Ob∣ligation upon us, to maintain the Worship of GOD, and to Serve the LORD in our Houses with diligence and constancy.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>THIS is the best way you can take to keep up and maintain your Authority in your Families.</HI> Thus to Honour GOD by Serving Him in your Fami∣lies, is the best way to secure to your selves Re∣spect and Obedience. If your Children and Servants see that you improve your Power for GOD; this will probably beget in them reverence and esteem. If Masters of Families are careful to Command their Houshold to fear the LORD, and keep His Commandments; This will give Force and Authority to those Commands which more immediately re∣spect themselves: For the Law of GOD doth re∣quire Children to obey their Parents; Servants, their Masters. The Word of GOD strongly en∣forceth Relative Duties as a Vital and Essential Part of pure Religion. And therefore the more we promote true Religion in our Houses; the more this flourisheth and grows: By so much the more will Heads of Families he likely to Maintain their Authority, and to receive those acknowledgements, that Duty &amp; Obedience in their Houses, which is owing to them. Their Piety will give them an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory. There's a Majesty in
<PB N="58" REF="001854_0072_0FB91D3D66EEDBA0"/>true Piety which commands Respect. But if Masters and Mistresses are Vicious and Profane themselves, and take no care to promote the Service of GOD in their Families; they may expect to be lightly esteemed. If they do thus dishonour GOD, He may be provok'd to <HI>pour Contempt</HI> upon them, and to lay their honour in the dust. 1 Sam. 2.30 — <HI>Them that honour Me, I will honour; and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.</HI> How often hath the Authority and Government of Heads of Families been forfeited and lost by not being improv'd for the Glory and Honour of GOD? And that Threatning hath been fulfilled. Isai. 24.2. <HI>And it shall be — as with the Servant, so with his Master; as with the Maid, so with her Mistress.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>TO promote Religion and the Service of GOD in our Families, will be most Comfortable and Advanta∣gious for Us and Ours.</HI> Heads of Families can't take a better course to promote the truest welfare of their Houses, than by taking Care to Serve the LORD in them. This will be both pleasant and profitable: For the more there is of Religion in the Family, the more comfort we shall be likely to have in our several Relations. The Word of GOD teacheth us how to discharge the Duties of our several Relations; and that's necessary in order to our Enjoying true Comfort in them.</P>
<P>THE more there is of true Religion in a Family, The more there will be of true Comfort and de∣light in the <HI>Conjugal Relation.</HI> If Husbands and Wives <HI>walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Law blameless,</HI> there will be a Mutual love and endearment between them; and the Commands of GOD respecting their Mutual Duties will not be grievous; but easy, pleasant, and delightful, as far as the Grace of GOD governs them. The more
<PB N="59" REF="001854_0073_0FB91D3F9793DF98"/>they <HI>dwell as heirs together of the Grace of Life;</HI> the more true Satisfaction will they enjoy: This will sweeten to them the Troubles they meet with, and make their burthens lighter, while each one doth his part, and bears his part, <HI>forbearing one another in love,</HI> in Obedience to GOD's Command∣ments.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The more careful Heads of Families are to Serve the LORD with their Houses, The more Comfort they will be likely to have in their <HI>Children.</HI> If we teach our Children the good know∣ledge of the LORD, and use our utmost endeavours that they may be made <HI>Wise to Salvation;</HI> then we may hope to have joy in them in this Life, and that which is to come. <HI>A wise Son maketh a glad Father,</HI> Prov. 15.20. The Love of Parents to their Children is a very Constant, and a very strong Passion. How greatly then must they rejoyce (if they understand their own interest, and the interest of their Children) <HI>To see their Children walking in the Truth.</HI> What a Satisfaction must it be to them to behold the Image of GOD shining in their Chil∣dren! And how great Blessings and Comforts will such Children be to their Parents! The more they fear GOD, and keep His Commandments; the more dutiful, the more helpful will they be; the more will they be the Staff and Solace of their Age. On the other hand, <HI>A foolish Son</HI> (and wickedness is the worst Folly) <HI>is a grief to his Father, and bit∣terness to her that bare him,</HI> Prov. 17 25. The more your Children love GOD, the more they obey His Commands; the more will they love one another, the closer will their Union be, which is their strength and glory. How pleasant is it both for Parents and Children, when they dwell together in Unity: Psal. 133.1, 2. <HI>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is, for
<PB N="60" REF="001854_0074_0FB91D4116810068"/>Brethren to dwell together in Unity. It's like the precious oyntment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments.</HI> Like a sweet perfume, it will afford delight, and chear the Spirits. Great Estates and. Possessions will not make your Children happy; No, No, If they have not the saving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST; If they do not choose GOD for their Portion: their Worldly enjoyments will be fuel for their Lusts; They will prove Snares and Temptations to them, estrange them from GOD, and so set them at a greater distance from true Blessedness; and plunge them into the deeper abyss of Misery.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The more Careful they are in this kind, the more likely will Masters of Families be to enjoy Comfort in <HI>their Servants.</HI> If our Servants become the Faithful Servants of GOD; they will then be Faithful and Diligent in Serving <HI>us.</HI> If Servants Fear the <HI>LORD,</HI> they will be Obedient to their <HI>Masters; Not with Eye-service as Men-plea∣sers, but as the Servants of Christ, doing the will of GOD from the Heart.</HI> Were Masters more careful to Teach their Servants to know the LORD, as well as to understand their Particular Trade; they would probably, not have so much reason to com∣plain of Unfaithful disobedient Servants, as now they have. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> writing to <HI>Philemon</HI> concerning his Servant <HI>Onesimus,</HI> whom he had be∣gotten in his bonds, says, Philemon 10, 11. verses. <HI>I beseech thee for my Son Onesimus whom I have begotten in my bonds: which in time past was to thee unprofita∣ble; but now profitable to thee, and to me.</HI></P>
<P>AND as Religion will be comfortable and bene∣ficial to the Heads of Families, and their Houses, In that it obligeth every One to the Duty of their
<PB N="61" REF="001854_0075_0FB91D429646CA10"/>respective Relations, and so tends to keep Peace in the Family, and to make the Members of it mu∣tual Blessings each to other <HI>while they live together:</HI> So also it wou'd afford strong consolation to Masters <HI>when the Relation between them and their Families, or any parts of them, shall be dissolved.</HI> We are Chil∣dren of Change, and many are the Changes which pass over us in this passing World. And in a little time Death will break the Bands whereby we are united, and Dissolve the Relations be∣tween Husbands and their Wives; Parents and their Children; Masters and their Servants. Now in hours of such Changes, it will be very Com∣fortable, if we can look back, and say, While we Lived together we took care to Serve the LORD together. This will be Comfortable to us, when our Children or Servants do remove from us, and become the Heads of distinct Families: This will be Comfortable to us, when our Chil∣dren or Servants shall be taken from us by Death. It is no new and uncommon thing for Parents that live to Old Age, to survive their Children. And they have the Sorrow many times of Bury∣ing Children that are grown up. Now it will afford them Light and Comfort in such a dark Hour, if they can say that they Devoted such Children unto GOD; That they Pray'd for them, and Pray'd with them; that they Educated them for GOD. This will be a Comfort to them when GOD calls for His Children which were given, or rather lent unto them. This will also be Com∣fortable to us when <HI>our own time to Die</HI> shall Ap∣proach; when the Hour shall draw nigh, in which we must be carried out of our Houses, to the silent Grave. O how Comfortable will it be, if, when the Voice of GOD's Providence says to us, as
<PB N="62" REF="001854_0076_0FB91D451F35A790"/>2 King. 20.1. <HI>Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live.</HI> I say, If then we can Appeal to GOD as <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> v. 3. <HI>I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.</HI> This will strengthen our Hearts when we come to bid an Eternal Farewel to our Houses; and the Places which now know us, shall know us no more. If we Serve GOD with our Houses in Sincerity, then we may in a Dy∣ing Hour Bless them in the Name of the LORD, with a well grounded hope that the Eternal JEHOVAH will continue to Dwell in our Fa∣milies, and delight to Bless them, when we are gathered to our Fathers. Then we may commit our near Relations unto GOD with an humble Confidence that He who is the EVERLASTING FATHER, will be <HI>the Father of our Fatherless Chil∣dren; the Husband of our Widows.</HI> Then we may leave our Children with GOD, hoping in Him that <HI>He will take them up,</HI> and take a Fatherly Care of them, when we are Dead and gone. If we can say, While we were with them in the World, we us'd our endeavours to keep them in the Fear and Service of GOD: we may then Pray in Faith that GOD would preserve them from <HI>the Evils,</HI> when we are not. In a Word, Thus to Serve GOD with our Houses, will be very Comfortable to us at the Great Day, when our Judge shall Demand of us, What have you done with, What have you done for your Chil∣dren and Servants which I gave you? O what Divine Pleasure and Satisfaction will it be, if we so Serve GOD here with our Houses, that we may come to Rejoyce together in the Day of CHRIST's Appearing. What a joyous Crown of
<PB N="63" REF="001854_0077_0FB91D465638E378"/>Glory will our Children be to us, if we shall be able in that Day to say, <HI>Lo here we are, and the Children Thou hast given us!</HI> But whatever the Event be; yet if we by the Grace of GOD, do our Duty in Sincerity, we shall give up our Account with Joy.</P>
<P>TO Conclude, Let us consider the many Obli∣gations we are under, to Serve the LORD with our Houses; how much it is both our Interest and Duty so to do. And then, resolve by the Help of GOD, That <HI>as for us and our Houses, we will Serve the Lord.</HI> Let us consider Seriously, that the Care and Charge of Families, is in a peculi∣ar manner committed to the Heads of them. O let us not then dare to Betray this Trust! Wo to us if we do. Let us awfully consider, that if we take no Care to Serve the LORD with our Houses, the Iniquity of our Houses will be laid to our Charge (as we have heard) and we, to∣gether with them, shall be expos'd to the Wrath and Curse of GOD. O that this Consideration might awaken us to Serve the Lord with <HI>Reverence and Godly Fear,</HI> in our Houses. O that we might be effectually perswaded by the Terrors of the LORD, to Serve GOD our selves, and to call up∣on our Children and Servants to join with us in this Excellent Service; to Warn and to Reprove them for their Sins, and use our Endeavours to Reclaim them, that so their Blood may not be re∣quired at our Hands, in the Great Day of Ac∣count. Let us Remember, that this is the way to engage the Presence of GOD with us, and to obtain His Blessing. And let Love to our selves, and our Children, quicken us in this way to seek after the Presence and Blessing of GOD, without
<PB N="64" REF="001854_0078_0FB91D4A165529C0"/>which our outward Enjoyments will be turned into Curses. Have we any regular Self-Love? Have we any true Affection to our Families? Have we any Bowels of Compassion Yearning to∣wards our Children, which are our selves multi∣plied? O then, let us show and manifest our Love, by using our utmost Endeavours to secure the Presence and Blessing of God, with our selves; with our Wives, who are our selves; with our Children; with our Servants. This will be the best and most evident Testimony of our hearty Love to them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Let us consider how Comfortable and Profitable it will be for us, and our Houses to Serve the LORD. And let us now seek after Comfort in our several Relations in this way. It may be we have been Extravagant in our Expectations, too ready to promise our selves great Pleasure and Satisfaction other ways, and upon other Accounts; but have been Disappointed (as Men generally are, when their Expectations from the Creature are Carnal and Sensual) and have found little else but Vanity, and Vexation of Spirit. Let us then Reflect on our Folly, and Repent of it. And now let us seek for Comfort, by Serving GOD our selves, and by taking care to Engage our Relations to join with us in Serving the LORD. In this we shall find solid Pleasure, durable Sa∣tisfaction. If we join together Heartily in Ser∣ving the LORD; we shall then have real Joy in our Relations, such Joy as Death it self shall not be able to Bereave us of. And now, <HI>O that we were Wise, and understood this;</HI> that we could con∣sider where our true Interest lies, and the Interest of our Families; that it might be well with us and ours for Ever.</P>

<HI>HEADS of Families <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e under Obligations to take Care, that they and their Houses Serve the LORD; Because this is the way to advance the Inte∣rest of Religion, in the Places where they dwell; and to make the Church of GOD in the Land, grow and flourish.</HI> Civil Societies consist of particular Fami∣lies combin'd and associated. And therefore if Masters would Reform their own Houses, this would be a good step towards a general Refor∣mation. Now every Man is under strong Obli∣gations to seek the Prosperity and Welfare of the Community which he belongs to. GOD Com∣manded His People of Old to Seek the Peace of the City whither He had caused them to be carried away Captives, and to Pray unto the LORD for it, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.7. Certainly then it becomes us to seek the Peace of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> of our <HI>Israel.</HI> No Man is born for himself alone, but also for his Country. And it should be every Ones ambition to be a Blessing to the Publick; and in nothing can we more truly promote the Publick W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l than by Endeavouring that tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Piety may flourish; That the Kingdom of CHRIST which is <HI>Righteousness, Peace, and Joy,</HI> may be set up and established. True Religion is the Glory, the Safety, the Hap∣piness of a People. Now though we are not all of us in Places of Publick Trust▪ Yet we may do excellent Service, and forward this good Work, by using the influence and authority we have in our Houses, for the honour of GOD, and the ad∣vancement of Religion. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Did Heads of Families take care to give their Children and Servants In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ustion, and to keep them under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good govern∣ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, this would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, encrease and strengthen the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of Religion in the Land. This would
<PB N="66" REF="001854_0080_0FB91D4D186A80E8"/>be an excellent Medium to Propagate the true Religion, and hand it down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Posterity. Cer∣tainly then Heads of Families are strongly oblig'd to teach their Children and Servants GOD's Sta∣tutes and His Judgments, and to Call upon them earnestly to Serve the LORD. This is the way to have our Children made the Blessings and Or∣naments of the Places where they dwell; and have them stand up for GOD, and maintain His Worship when we are dead and laid in our Graves. Whereas if Family-Instruction be neglected, if Fa∣mily-Discipline be not kept up, and that with a peculiar regard to the advancement of true Piety, and for the discountenancing of Vice: We shall have dreadful reason to fear that there will arise a Generation not knowing the LORD, and refu∣sing to Obey His Commandments. Undoubtedly then, Heads of Families are under Indispensible Obligations to Instruct their Children, and Com∣mand them to Serve the LORD. For in this way they will do excellent Service to the Publick, and lend a helping hand towards the building of GOD's Temple among us. If we would hope to have our Churches grow and encrease with the Increasings of GOD; we must keep up Family Religion, that so our Houses may be Nurseries of true Piety, wherein our Young Ones may grow up, thrive and flourish; and as they grow in Stature, increase in true Wisdom and Knowledge; that they may when grown up to Maturity; be as Trees of Righteousness Planted <HI>in the Courts of our GOD,</HI> that bring forth their fruit in due Season. And indeed, Heads of Families are in a peculiar manner oblig'd to this Duty from the Privileges which they and their Children are admitted to in the Churches of CHRIST. Our Children are
<PB N="67" REF="001854_0081_0FB91D50D65E68F0"/>generally Baptised. Now when Parents do enter into Covenant with GOD, and when they offer their Children to GOD in Baptism, they bring them∣selves under engagements to bring up their Children <HI>in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD;</HI> to Edu∣cate them for that GOD whose Name is call'd upon them, and to whom they are devoted when they receive this initiating Seal of the Covenant. When therefore we neglect this Duty, we are guilty of lying to the LORD, and are Perjured in His Covenant. O that we were awaken'd to consider the Vows of the LORD which are upon us, more Seriously, more Solemnly! It is to be feared, It is much to be feared, that many who seek this Privilege for their Children, looking upon it as an honorary Badge, which it is disgraceful to want: I say that many forget the peculiar bonds and obligations they are under to Serve the LORD themselves, and to take care that their Children be consecrated to His Service. And then, unless Heads of Families take care that such as are under their Government be Instructed; the Publick Dispensations of the Word and Ordinances will be likely to be lost upon them. If they are not taught the Principles and first Rudiments of the Christian Religion, nor acquainted with the Im∣portant Truths and Mysteries of it, it can't be expected that the Word Preached should profit them. For want of this, says One, <Q>When we speak never so plainly of the things pertaining to the kingdom of GOD, to the most we do but speak Parables.</Q> Unless our Children and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervants be Catechised at Home, the plainest Truths almost delivered from the Pulpit, will be dark sayings to them. Now it can't be supposed that these Truths, how weighty soever, should sink
<PB N="68" REF="001854_0082_0FB91D52565B86A8"/>deep into their Hearts, if they have not a place in their Understandings. We see then that the Growth and Prosperity of the Churches of CHRIST do very strongly oblige Heads of Families to teach such as are under their Care, to Fear and Serve the LORD. And if Heads of Families would seriously set about this good Work of Fa∣mily-Reformation, this would have an happy Ten∣dency, by the Blessing of GOD, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing on a General Reformation, and to promote true God∣liness in the Power of it.</P>

He betrusts him with a very considerable Talent; and in the voice of His Providence He gives him a solemn Charge to occupy with it and improve it to His Glory. Masters of Families are GOD's <HI>Servants,</HI> and they must not seek themselves, chiefly and ultimately; their own Honour, their own Pleasure or Profit. They must not think that all they have to do, is to command respect and obe∣dience to themselves, and to receive the Profits of the Labour of their Houshold; No, nor yet that they discharge all their Duty, if they are careful to teach their Servants skill in their Par∣ticular Calling, and to make them Masters of their Trade, and to provide sufficient proper Food, and Cloathing, and all suitable outward accommoda∣tions for them. These things must not be lest undone; 1 Tim. 5.8. <HI>But if any provide not for
<PB N="69" REF="001854_0083_0FB91D5498BD30E0"/>his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the Faith, and is worse than an Infidel.</HI> But then there are greater and weightier Matters incumbent on Masters of Families: They must take care, as we have heard, that their Houshold be fed with Divine Knowledge and Understand∣ing, and that they and their Houses Serve the LORD. Certainly then, the Care of a Family is a weighty Betrustment which Masters are con∣cern'd to discharge with Diligence and Fidelity in the Fear of GOD. It would be well if Heads of Families, and particularly if Young Beginners would seriously Consider of this, and Act accor∣dingly.</P>

Let not any therefore raise Ob∣jections, or frame Excuses, to Blind or Bribe their Consciences. Do not say that you are under such low Circumstances, and so hurried in your Worldly Business, that you can't spare time for Religious Duties; To Pray in your Families, and the like. This is a poor Excuse: What, are you so Cumbred about many things, as to neglect the One thing needful. Will this turn to your Account in the Day of the LORD? Is this to Consult the true Interest of your Houses? No, no, you and yours stand in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> need of the Favour and Gracious Presence of GOD, than of your Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and Rai∣ment. And then, it may be your Poverty is a just Judgment of GOD upon you, for your Rob∣bing Him of the Offerings of Prayer and Praise; and for refusing to Serve Him in your Families. Cry to GOD then for His Grace; Set up the Wor∣ship of GOD in your Families; and you will find that Time spent in His Service, is Redeemed Time. For this is the way, as you have heard, to obtain His Blessing on your Outward Affairs. Do not say, your Family Business is so great, that you have not time for Family Duties. This Plea will not Profit you in the Day of Wrath. <HI>For what is a man pro∣fited if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul?</HI> Mat. 16.26.</P>
<P>DO not say, you have not Ability to engage in the Duties of Family-Worship; particularly, to Pray with your Families: And so cast off Family Religion. But rather Cry importunately to GOD to teach you to Pray, and to help your Infirmities. Study the Holy Scriptures, and your own Hearts; Meditate on your manifold Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Consider your
<PB N="71" REF="001854_0085_0FB91D5857A2EF10"/>Wants, and the many Mercies you daily receive at the Hands of GOD. This will afford you Matter for Confessions, Petitions, and Thanks∣givings. And know it, GOD doth not look at the Elegancy and Neatness of your Expressions in Pray∣er; but at the Frame and Temper of your Hearts. Do not therefore live in the neglect of this Duty, because you cannot Discharge it so well as might be desired. Engage in it in Obedience to GOD; look to Him for Strength, and He will assist you. Be now perswaded to give up your selves to the LORD, and then take Care to maintain the Wor∣ship of GOD in your Families; and to use your Endeavours that your Houses may Serve the LORD. O do not put off this great and important Duty any longer. Let the Time past of your Lives su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e, that you have lived without GOD in your Houses. And now to Day, while it's called to Day, Resolve in the Strength of GOD's Grace, that you will set up Family Religion. Now Sanctify your Houses, and Consecrate them to the Service of GOD.</P>
<P>AND then, let such as have been Scandalously Remiss and Negligent in Serving the LORD with their Houses, receive the Reproof of our Text and Doctrine in Meekness of Wisdom. And for the future, engage in this Duty with Zeal, Constancy and Diligence. <HI>Be Zealous and Repent</HI> of your past Sloth and Negligence; and revive the Things which are ready to Die in your Families. And be not any longer Slothful in this Business; <HI>but fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord.</HI> Be Constant in your Family-Worship.

Well, you have Solid Matter of Comfort, in as much as your GOD Lives for ever, that GOD, who's Favour is better than Life; That GOD who is able to give you <HI>Beauty for ashes, the Oyl of Joy for Mourning;</HI> the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness: That GOD, who is <HI>All in all.</HI> The Presence of GOD, and the Covenant-Relation you stand in to Him, should be your Support under all the Calamities which fall upon your Houses. Thus <HI>David</HI> comforts himself, 2 Sam. 23.5. <HI>Although my house be not so with GOD; yet He hath made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure: for this is all my Salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</HI> Let the Righteous then, that <HI>Serve</HI> the LORD in their Houses, see that they Serve Him with <HI>Gladness</HI> and <HI>Chearful∣ness;</HI> And in this Manner recommend Family-Re∣ligion to Others, as Pleasant, Peaceful, and Joyful.</P>
<P><HI>USE. V.</HI> FROM what hath been said, <HI>We may Learn the Wretched and Miserable Condition of those Houses which cast off the Fear of GOD, and restrain Prayer.</HI> Contraries have contrary consequences. From the Comfort and Happiness of Religious Families, We may Infer the Misery of the Taber∣nacles of Iniquity, the deplorable State of those Houses wherein Satan is Served. The Houses of such as Serve the LORD, are happy in the gracious
<PB N="75" REF="001854_0089_0FB91D5FD7F9E4C8"/>Presence of GOD. But there's are Miserable; for GOD is far from them; and <HI>they that are far from Him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all perish.</HI> They are without GOD, and therefore destitute of <HI>all Good,</HI> Yea Satan hath his Seat in their Houses; This Evil One <HI>who goes a∣bout like a Roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour, As a Strong Man armed,</HI> he keeps their Houses. The Blessing of GOD is on the Habitation of the just; but His Curse is upon the wicked: Psal. 11.6. <HI>Upon the wicked he shall rain Snares, Fire and Brimstone, and an horrible Tempest: this shall be the portion of their Cup.</HI> Indeed sometimes the Houses of such Sinners <HI>are safe from fear, and the rod of GOD is not upon them. They send forth their little Ones like a flock, and their Children Dance; they take the Timbrel and Harp and rejoyce at the sound of the Organ,</HI> Job 21.9. <HI>to</HI> 12. But then <HI>How often is the Candle of the wicked put out; and how often cometh their destruction upon them, GOD distributeth Sorrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Anger.</HI> Their Outward enjoyments will be turned into Curses. <HI>Their Table shall become a Snare before them, that which should have been for their welfare, shall become a Trap.</HI> O that such as forget GOD, and refuse to Serve Him in their Houses, would consider this, and Repent and Reform be∣fore GOD pour out His Fury upon them, and make them utterly desolate!</P>
<P><HI>USE. VI.</HI> WHAT hath been said <HI>aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds us a loud call and Incitation to Serve the LORD with our Houses.</HI> Let us then receive the word of Ex∣hortation which our Text and Doctrine give us, and comply with it. Let us first give up our <HI>Selves</HI> to the LORD; and then take care to Con∣secrate our <HI>Houses</HI> to His Service. What hath been said under the Second Head concerning the Obli∣gations
<PB N="76" REF="001854_0090_0FB91D645691A620"/>which Heads of Families are under to Serve the LORD with their Houses, may be im∣proved as Motives to enforce this Duty. Give me leave to add One or Two Hints, by way of Counsel and Direction.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>HAVE an Eye to this in your first Settlement, and begin to Serve the LORD with your House, as soon as the Providence of GOD makes you the Head of a Fa∣mily.</HI> Let it be your Care and Endeavour to seek such to dwell with you, as will heartily joyn with you in Serving the LORD; and will counte∣nance True Religion in your Family. And when you are Settled in a Family, Let your first and chief Care be to Sanctify your House, and Con∣secrate it to be a Temple for the Blessed GOD to dwell in; to be an House of Prayer, where∣in He shall be Worshipped. Don't plead, that you are Afraid or Ashamed to be Priest to your Family in this regard, and to lead in the Worship of GOD: But break through the Discouragements which lye in your way, with Christian Courage and Resolution. Delays in this Matter are very Dangerous. The longer we neglect to Serve the LORD in our Houses, the more will our Temp∣tations to live without GOD in our Houses, grow and prevail upon us.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>LET us Watch against every Thing that would hinder us from Serving the LORD with our Houses.</HI> Guard against Contentions and Divisions; and see that you Prudently follow the Things which make for Peace. It can't be expected, that a Family should be united in Serving the LORD, while the House is Divided against it self. Take care then to improve your Influence and Authority to keep
<PB N="77" REF="001854_0091_0FB91D65D69CA2A0"/>Peace in your Houses; and beware of doing any Thing to Sow the Seeds of Discord and Contention.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Shun Wicked and Profane Company. If you choose the Open Enemies of GOD and Re∣ligion, for your Companions; If Persons of Pro∣fane Lives, and Dissolute Manners frequent your Houses with Freedom: This will put a Damp up∣on Family-Religion; and you and your Houses will be in eminent Danger of learning their ways. If therefore you would Serve the LORD with your Houses, you must say with him, Psal. 6.8. <HI>Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity.</HI> On the other Hand, You must seek the Fellowship and Acquaintance of such as Serve the LORD with their Houses, and will be ready to Encourage, Strengthen and Confirm you in this Excellent Service. It would be very Beautiful, very Profitable, if such Houses as are Housholds of Faith, would cultivate an In∣timate Acquaintance, and Endearing Friendship each with other. And that, among other Things, for this very End, that they might strengthen each other in Family-Piety, by their Amicable Union, and by their Communion in Offices of Kindness and Love.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>ENDEAVOUR so to Order your Secular Affairs, that they may not interfere with, or crowd out the Worship and Service of GOD.</HI> Every Thing is Beautiful in it's Season; and that Business which is done <HI>Sea∣sonably,</HI> is most likely to be <HI>well</HI> done. There is a Time when it's our Duty to be Worshipping GOD in Secret: There is a Time when it is our Duty to be Worshipping GOD in our Families: There is also a Time when it's our Duty to be Diligently Employ'd in our Particular Callings.
<PB N="78" REF="001854_0092_0FB91D675625FBA0"/>Now we must study so to Order our Affairs with Wisdom and Discretion, that Religious Duties may have their proper <HI>Time</HI> allow'd them, and be attended upon in the most convenient Season.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>STUDY to make the Exercises of Religion as Easy, Pleasant and Profitable as you can.</HI> Endeavour to draw your Children and Servants to joyn with you in Serving the LORD, by <HI>the Cords of a Man, and the Bands of Love.</HI> Countenance and Cherish what you see of Good in them; and let them see that you are <HI>Pleased,</HI> when they endeavour to <HI>Please</HI> and Serve the LORD. Let not your Instructi∣ons be Tedious, through the Length of them; but rather often Repeated and Inculcated. Let not your Discipline be excessively rigorous. Let your Family-Prayers be rather Fervent and Frequent, than very Long. Thus Endeavour to make your Religious Exercises as Easy, Pleasant and Profita∣ble as you can. It is true, GOD alone can give Persons a Spiritual Relish for Divine Things; However, we must employ our Care and Diligence, not to Prejudice them against the Ways of Godli∣ness. We must Labour, and be very Diligent in the Business of Religion: But should Prudently endeavour, not to make it unnecessarily Burdensome to our selves or others.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>POUR out your Souls to GOD in Secret Prayer, for a Blessing on your Endeavours to Maintain and Pro∣mote the Fear and Service of GOD in your Houses.</HI> GOD alone can Crown your Endeavours with the desired Success, and make them Effectual to set up, and Establish His Kingdom in your Houses. You can't teach your Children or Servants to Know GOD Savingly; you can't Write the Laws of GOD
<PB N="79" REF="001854_0093_0FB91D6B17CEE8E0"/>on their Hearts. Unless GOD pour out His Spi∣rit upon them, they will continue <HI>in the Gall of Bit∣terness, and Bond of Iniquity;</HI> for all what you are able to do. <HI>Abraham,</HI> who is Celebrated in Scrip∣ture for his Care, to Command his Houshold to keep GOD's Statutes, had a Mocking <HI>Ishmael</HI> in his Family. <HI>Isaac,</HI> a Profane <HI>Esau; David,</HI> the Man af∣ter GOD's own Heart, a Wicked <HI>Absalom.</HI> See then that you not only Pray <HI>with</HI> your Families; but also that you Pray to GOD in Secret <HI>for</HI> them; That GOD would make every One a Living Tem∣ple for Him to dwell in; that He would pour His Spirit on your Seed, and His Blessing on your Off∣spring. You can't teach Men the Saving Knowlege of the Mysteries of Godliness, as you may teach them your Particular Calling. The Blessing of GOD's Common Providence is sufficient for the latter; but the Influence of His Especial Grace is necessary to Effect the former. Take Care then to Wrestle with GOD in Secret Prayer as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, when he and his Houshold were greatly Distressed, for Fear of his Brother <HI>Esau.</HI> Then you may hope to Prevail with GOD to Command a Blessing on your Diligent En∣deavours to Serve the LORD with your Houses.</P>
<P>THUS we have in an imperfect manner, Con∣sidered some of the Duties which Masters of Fami∣lies must Carefully attend unto, if they would Serve the LORD with their Houses: As also some of the Obligations which they are under to Discharge these Duties; And have made some brief Applica∣tion. What Remains now, but that we Cry to GOD for His Holy Spirit, to make a Saving and Powerful Application of these Truths to our Souls; to put these Laws and Commands in our Inward Parts, and to Write them in our Hearts: That we
<PB N="80" REF="001854_0094_0FB91D6C97B64060"/>may be the <HI>Epistle of Christ, written not with Ink, but by the Spirit of the Living GOD.</HI> And that this Word of GOD may be in our Hearts, as Seed sown in good Ground, bringing forth Fruit to Life Eternal. Let us now each of us be prevailed with to give up our selves to the LORD, to Obey and Serve Him for Ever. And the LORD grant, that Heads of Families may be perswaded Seriously to Consider how much they are Obliged to Maintain and Pro∣mote the Service of GOD in their Houses! O that all were brought to Subscribe to <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Resolution and Engagement, and to say, one and another of us, <HI>As for me and my House, we will serve the LORD.</HI> If we be only the Hearers of the Word, it will be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>of Death unto Death,</HI> and Aggravate our Con∣demnation in the Day of Judgment. For our Savi∣our hath told us, Luk. 12.47. <HI>And that Servant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</HI> But if we be not only the Hearers, but also the Doers of the Word; we shall be blessed in our Deed. For if we walk before GOD with a perfect Heart, and Serve Him Faithfully in our Houses: Then GOD will dwell with us here; and we shall dwell with Him for ever. And when we shall leave our Houses on Earth, we <HI>shall have a Building of GOD an House not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</HI></P>
