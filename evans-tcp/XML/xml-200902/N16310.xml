<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES and GENTLEMEN.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been a subject of considerable regret, that a Collection of the best Modern Songs, not only the production of America, but likewise those of Bri∣tain has never before appeared on this continent.</P>
<P>To remedy which, the Editors have been at considerable labour in collecting from the most Esteem'd Song Books, publish'd in Europe, a compilation, suit∣able in some degree to this country.</P>
<P>To this collection the Fair Americans may safely have recourse, without the the start of a blush upon their cheeks, or offending the most rigid virtue; nor can the Gentlemen be more pleased by the particular attention shewn to the Ladies, than by the compliment we pay to their good sense, in avoiding all manner of in∣decent songs and <HI>double entendres.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020930_0003_0FB14BD86CE37868"/>Here will be found a number of origi∣nal Songs, the production of the American Muse: We are only sorry it has not been in our power to collect a greater number of these at the present time —But, providing the present volume meets with encouragement from the Public, the Edi∣tors have it in Contemplation to Publish a Second, when, they flatter themselves, they will be able to exhibit the most of the Principal Songs wrote in the United States.—However, if in this Col∣lection we have put a chearful and enter∣taining Companion into the hands of the Ladies and Gentlemen of America, we trust, on their part, they will encourage the rising arts of their native country, which will particularly oblige their very humble servants,</P>

<L>A Few years ago, in the days of my Grannum,</L>
<L>(A worthy good woman as ever broke bread)</L>
<L>What lectures she gave! in the morning began 'em,</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd till she laid herself down on her bed;</L>
<L>She never declin'd what she once undertook;</L>

<L>Persisted,</L>

<L>Said she, Child, whatever your fate is hereafter,</L>
<L>If married, if single, if old, or if young,</L>
<L>In madness, in sadness, in tears, or in laughter,</L>
<L>But follow my maxims, you cannot do wrong:</L>
<L>Each passion, each temper, I always could brook;</L>
<L>When scolded,</L>
<L>I moulded,</L>
<L>When heated,</L>
<L>Retreated,</L>
<L>And manag'd my matters, by hook or by crook.</L>

<LG>
<L>Ensnar'd by her counsels, I ventur'd to marry,</L>
<L>And fancy'd a wife, by my grandmother's rules,</L>
<L>Might be taught like a spaniel to fetch and to carry,</L>
<L>But soon I found out that we both had been fools:</L>

<L>AS Jockey was trudging the meadows so gay,</L>
<L>So blithe and so bonny his air,</L>
<L>He met a young lass who was going his way,</L>
<L>Her face all so clouded with care:</L>
<L>He ask'd her what made her so moping and sad?</L>
<L>'Twas pity if she were in pain:</L>
<L>She sign'd "I have lost the very best lad,</L>
<L>"And I never shall see him again!"</L>

<L>Is he gone to the wars for full many a year,</L>
<L>Quoth Jockey, who troubles you so?</L>
<L>Or else where on earth he can never appear,</L>

<L>"No, he's fled (she reply'd with another fond she,</L>
<L>"Tho' to me he was plighted for aye,</L>
<L>"O'er the mountains he's gone with another from me,</L>
<L>"And therefore I cannot be gay."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If that's all, quoth Jockey, your wailing give o'er,</L>
<L>He's a loon, who is not worth your pain;</L>
<L>Let him go, since he's chang'd, be you wretched no more,</L>
<L>Nor think of a false-hearted swain:</L>
<L>But take, if you will, for the lad of your heart,</L>
<L>Whom fortune has thrown in your way,</L>

<L>AS t'other day milking I sat in the vale,</L>
<L>Young Damon came up to address his soft tale,</L>
<L>So sudden, I started, and gave him a frown,</L>
<L>For he frighted my cow, and my milk was kick'd down.</L>

<L>I little thought now he'd his passion advance,</L>
<L>But pretty excuses made up the mischance:</L>
<L>He begg'd a kind kiss, which I gave him, I vow,</L>
<L>And I laid my own self, all the fault on the cow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many ways love can the bosom invade!</L>
<L>His bait prov'd too strong, alas! for a maid:</L>
<L>He hinted that wedlock was what he'd be at,</L>
<L>But I thought it was best to say nothing of that.</L>

<L>I flutter all over whene'er he comes nigh,</L>

<L>And on that night when all the crew</L>
<L>The mem'ry of their former lives</L>
<L>O'er flowing cans of flip renew,</L>
<L>And drink their sweethearts and their wives,</L>
<L>I'll heave a sigh, I'll heave a sigh</L>
<L>And think on thee;</L>
<L>And as the ship rolls thro' the sea,</L>
<L>The burden of my song shall be.</L>
<L>Blow high, &amp;c.</L>

<L>HOW happy's he, whoe'er he be</L>
<L>That in his life meets one true friend,</L>
<L>Who cordially does sympathise</L>
<L>In words, in action, heart and mind.</L>
<L>My kind respects do not neglect</L>
<L>Altho' my wealth or state be small</L>
<L>With a melting heart and a mournful eye</L>
<L>I beg the Lord be with you all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My loving friends, I kiss your hands,</L>
<L>For time invites me for to move;</L>
<L>On your poor servant lay commands,</L>
<L>Who is ambitious of your love.</L>
<L>He—whose pow'r and might, both day and night,</L>
<L>Governs the depths, makes rain to fall,</L>
<L>To sun and moon gives course of light,</L>
<L>Direct, protect, defend you all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I do protest, within my breast.</L>
<L>Your memory I'll not neglect;</L>
<L>On that record I'll lay arrest,</L>
<L>Hell's fury shall not alter it.</L>
<L>All I desire of earthly bliss,</L>
<L>Is to be freed from guilt or thrall;</L>
<L>I hope my God will grant me this:</L>
<L>Good night, and joy be with you all.</L>
