<HEAD>THE COMET.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>ESCEND, <HI>Urania,</HI> and inspire my verse,</L>
<L>I raise my song to sing your kindred stars;</L>
<L>I aim to rove where glitt'ring comets stray,</L>
<L>Trace the bright wand'rers thro' th' Ae∣therial way,</L>
<L>And all around th' Almighty's pow'r proclaim,</L>
<L>Where worlds can roll, or suns incessant flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See! heav'nly muse, view with attentive eyes,</L>
<L>The ruddy wonder of the ev'ning skies!</L>
<L>From star, to star, the burning ruin rolls,</L>
<L>Beams thro' the Aether, and alarms the poles:</L>
<L>Around the earth the wond'ring nations gaze,</L>
<L>On the dire terrors of the lengthen'd blaze,</L>
<L>While, trailing on, they dream its sparkling hair,</L>
<L>Shakes famine, earthquake, pestilence and war:</L>
<L>Illusions vain! remote from human things,</L>
<L>Where other planets roll in other rings</L>
<L>It travels vast; and all around proclaims</L>
<L>A world in chaos, or an earth in flames.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="3" REF="005353_0003_1017217BE6D4EEE8"/>
<L>So, thro' the Aether, swept the ancient earth,</L>
<L>Ere time, and form, and beauty first had birth,</L>
<L>Unshap'd and void, thro' space immense it roam'd,</L>
<L>Till spoke the GOD—and <HI>Eden</HI> instant bloom'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What ruin! what confusion might be hurl'd,</L>
<L>By such a ball, upon our guilty world?</L>
<L>Witness, ye waves, which in the deluge spread,</L>
<L>Whelm'd o'er the earth, and stretch'd the nations dead.</L>
<L>Down heav'n's high steep, wide-spread the steaming train</L>
<L>Rush'd on the fields, and pour'd the floods of rain;</L>
<L>The dark abyss, attracted into day,</L>
<L>Gush'd o'er the mountain-tops, and ror'd away;</L>
<L>The tost ark, tott'ring, thro' its fabrick shook,</L>
<L>Involv'd in clouds and darkness, foam and smoke,</L>
<L>By tempests plung'd along from steep to steep,</L>
<L>Bounds to the clouds, or dashes down the deep.</L>
<L>Ye angels! guard her thro' the stormy scene,</L>
<L>Till the gay rainbow arch the heav'ns serene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, O my muse, swift must the time come on,</L>
<L>When fresh inspir'd, and fervid from the sun,</L>
<L>The flagrant Stranger shapes a diff'rent path,</L>
<L>And from its annual orbit drags the earth.</L>
<L>Ye fancy, mortals! distant as ye are,</L>
<L>All calm and placid round the sailing star,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="005353_0004_1017217D82CD21F0"/>
In gentle rays serenely gleams the head,</L>
<L>And easy luster thro' the train is spread:</L>
<L>Ah, ye perceive not what loud tumult reigns</L>
<L>Thro' the hot regions of its wild domains;</L>
<L>What hideous thunder the wide Aether shocks,</L>
<L>Of tumbling mountains, and of crashing rocks:</L>
<L>Fierce seas of flame beat round the burning shores,</L>
<L>And ev'ry tempest raves, and every furnace rores.</L>
<L>To this devoted earth it marches on,</L>
<L>And midnight blazes with the glare of noon;</L>
<L>Big, and more big, it arches all the air,</L>
<L>A vault of fluid Brass the skies appear:</L>
<L>From their foundations, where they ancient stood,</L>
<L>Down rush the mountains in a flaming flood;</L>
<L>The min'rals pour their melted bowels out,</L>
<L>The rocks run down, the flying rivers spout;</L>
<L>The earth disolves thro' its disjointed frame,</L>
<L>Its clouds all lighten, and its <HI>Aetna's</HI> flame;</L>
<L>The sea exhales, and in long volumes hurl'd,</L>
<L>Follows the wand'ring globe from world to world;</L>
<L>Now at the sun it glows, now steers its flight</L>
<L>Thro' the cold desarts of eternal night,</L>
<L>Warns every creature thro' its trackless road,</L>
<L>The fate of sinners, and the wrath of GOD.</L>
