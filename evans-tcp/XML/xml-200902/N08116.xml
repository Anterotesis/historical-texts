<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following essay is the fruit of some solitary hours, penned and published with a sincere desire for the reformation of the se∣veral classes of mankind, who are immersed in vice and sensuality,— of the designing and knavish,—and the stability of every virtuous, and ingenious person.</P>
<P>The manner in which I have thrown my thoughts together, seemed to occur the most easy, and for some reasons appeared to me the most eligible.</P>
<P>I am not so vain as to imagine my performance is free from inac∣curacies; but such errors as have either escaped my notice, or are be∣yond my weak abilities to amend, I hope my <HI>Candid Reader</HI> will correct and excuse.</P>
<P>The person who ventures out on the public Stage as an author, be∣comes of course subject to the various criticisms of his observers; the keen invectives of satire, and the poisoned arrows of envy, are illibe∣rally dealt against his character and productions.—These I am pre∣pared to receive, with a contempt due to the efforts of malevolence; and, at the same time, shall not forget to pay a proper respect and deference to the criticisms of candour and ingenuity.</P>
<P>The poem before you, contains neither the Life nor Opinions of Tri∣stram Shandy, the Memoirs of a Gentleman of Pleasure, or the Amours of a Lady of Quality.—A piece, I must confess, not so well adapted to the genius of the present age; an age, in which subjects serious, important and interesting, can scarce obtain a hearing, are treated with indifference, and forgot, whilst their authors are ridi∣culed as fools, or pitied as enthusiasts.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010355_0003_0F7EA254C1B3C2B0"/>To treat of the Deity, his attributes, the relation we stand in to him, and the indispensable obligation of social and religious duties,— to excite considerations on the uncertainty of time, the certainty of death, and the awful approaching decision of infinite wisdom and pu∣rity, with a certain class of mankind, are deemed enthusiastic specu∣lations, and idle reveries;—the certain specimens of either ignorance, a heated zeal, or of incurable madness. A class, who▪ to avoid the extreme of superstition and fanaticism, have incautiously run into ano∣ther still more alarming and dangerous, from the borders of Implicit Faith to the confines of Infidelity, from a false heated zeal to the coldest indifference, and from the austerities of a penance to the most relaxed licentious indulgence. Be ours to walk in the happy medium of truth, and of right reason; the medium between the zeal-less and zealot, or indifference and presumption; and let the deluded of both extremes become the objects of our pity, and be remembered in our prayers.</P>
<P>You of every rank, degree, and circumstance in life, into whose hand this may fall, as rational and accountable beings, improve the few, fleeting moments of your continuance in this mode of existence, in matters of infinite consequence; consider seriously the important business of life, acquaint yourselves with the various branches of a Christian's duty, and discharge them with integrity.</P>
<P>Remember time is short; life altogether uncertain; and that death is inevitable. The time is approaching, when the sable mantle of af∣fliction will be cast over all the pomp of a court, the glitter of a ball, and the ludicrous scenes of a comedy. The period, the awful period is hastening, when from life will be exhausted all its balm, and from terrestrial objects their power of pleasing — when every enjoyment will become insipid, except the complacent notice of <HI>uncreated excellence,</HI> the testimony of a good <HI>conscience,</HI> and the assurance of a happy futurity. Devote then your days, should they be few or many, to the service of <HI>Him,</HI> who hath called us to glory and virtue. Let not the enchanting scene of illusive pleasures, the influence of bad example, or the incitement of the libertine, prevail on you to run with the heedless multitude to do evil; walk pensive with the few on the side of virtue, acquit yourselves as men, and as Christians, and the lot of your inheritance will be with the just;—for, <HI>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily there is a God who judgeth the earth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DESCANT on the TIMES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE clock strikes five—the fiery orb appears;</L>
<L>He seems t' emerge as from the briny deep,</L>
<L>Just gilds the hoary brow of yon high mount,</L>
<L>Darts lucid gleams throughout the atmosphere,</L>
<L>And bids depart the shadows of the night.</L>
<L>At his command they flee the firmament;</L>
<L>Then, for a moment, haunt the deep recess</L>
<L>Of arched valleys, groves, and leafy woods;</L>
<L>Now, higher risen, 'nihilates the gloom—</L>
<L>Drowns antient night in farthest western seas.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The flow'ry mead, the shrub, the quick-set hedge,</L>
<L>Spread o'er with Heaven's dew, in lustre vies</L>
<L>With orient gems; so christalline the drops:</L>
<L>No cloud is seen, throughout the wide expanse</L>
<L>Of Heaven's arched vault; the vapour dense</L>
<L>Ascending from the valleys, marshy swamps,</L>
<L>Sol's rays, obliquely glancing, dissipate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, let me labour up th' acclivity</L>
<L>Of yonder eminence, and there recline</L>
<L>Upon the verdant ridge, bask in the blaze</L>
<L>The genial heat inspire, and feel the glow</L>
<L>Of Sol's refulgent rays glide thro' my veins—</L>
<L>Correct the languor of my quiv'ring pulse,</L>
<L>Exhilerate my spirits, sinking, sunk</L>
<L>By cruel hectic, colliquative sweats.</L>
</LG>

<PB REF="010355_0004_0F7EA255692E0DA0"/>
<L>The steep now gain'd, the pleasing landscape opes—</L>
<L>A variegated scene's disclos'd to view,</L>
<L>Of hills, of dales, of woods, of smiling meads,</L>
<L>And interspers'd with riv'lets, meand'rous streams.</L>
<L>See, what large herds of cattle, spread around,</L>
<L>With bags distended by salubrious juice,</L>
<L>Lowing, impatient wait the loitering swain</L>
<L>To ease them of a full, <HI>spring,</HI> milky tide!</L>
<L>The feather'd species hop from spray to spray;</L>
<L>Or, perch'd on th' highest branch of lofty elms,</L>
<L>Or on the pliant hazel twig, adjust</L>
<L>Their variegated plumes in neat arrange,</L>
<L>And hail the morn with songs of gratitude.</L>
<L><HI>Th' aspiring lark, her matin anthem thrills</HI></L>
<L>High in the aerial space, beyond my ken,</L>
<L>Lost in the blaze of Sol's refulgent beams;</L>
<L>Not out of hearing, her melodious song,</L>
<L>Soft tun'd, more grateful than the violins,</L>
<L>Descending lights upon m' attentive ear;</L>
<L>The inspiration of her tuneful lay</L>
<L>My mind, so much depress'd beneath the load</L>
<L>Of complicate disease, exhilerates.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! how my soul's enraptur'd! what a scene,</L>
<L>Diversified around, now strikes my eye;</L>
<L>My ear, what melody—e'en nature seems</L>
<L>To raise my soul to thoughts refin'd, sublime,</L>
<L>Of the grand <HI>cause.</HI> But O! how weak the powers</L>
<L>Of human reason! the most enlarg'd ideas</L>
<L>Frail mortals form, or seraphs can attain,</L>
<L>Are infinitely short of God's perfections—</L>
<L><HI>His attributes!</HI> O what a vast profound!</L>
<L>Hark! Moses hints his power! proclaims his praise!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The world in chaos—without form, and void—</L>
<L>When darkness envelop'd the <HI>formless</HI> mass—</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="010355_0004_0F7EA255692E0DA0"/>Ere man, or beast, or fish, or reptile liv'd,</L>
<L>Th' Almighty <HI>fiat spoke;</HI> then, order sprang</L>
<L>From drear confusion; beauty, out of <HI>void.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Let there be light</HI>—in th' east the windows op'd—</L>
<L>The grand, primoeval day began to dawn;</L>
<L><HI>And there was light</HI>—he plac'd the firmament—</L>
<L>The atmosphere—impos'd on matter laws.</L>
<L>The sun, the moon, the starry myriads form'd,</L>
<L>Assign'd their spheres in wisdom consummate,</L>
<L>Describ'd their ample circuit, bade them whirl</L>
<L>With motion uniform, the round immense.</L>

<L>E'en legible to Reason's cloudy eye;</L>
<L>So plain, that we may even <HI>Run and Read</HI></L>
<L><HI>His power, his godhead; we're without excuse.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>O thou supreme, all-wise, sufficient God—</L>

<L>Th' azure, wide, immensurable space</L>
<L>Of aether; or, the grand display, beneath,</L>

<L>In humble admiration—<HI>What is man!</HI></L>
<L>Wilt thou regard him! wilt thou deign to stoop</L>
<L>To his infirmities—to notice man—</L>
<L>A humbling thought—thou hast, thou dost, thou wilt.</L>
<L>For MAN, Immanuel bled on Calvary!</L>
<L>For MAN, a bloody sweat bedew'd his brow!</L>
<L>For MAN, he cry'd, <HI>Lama Sabacthani!</HI></L>
<L>For MAN, he liv'd, he died!—what love is this!</L>
<L>Does man despise him! daring folly this!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="010355_0005_0F7EA255EFDD0188"/>And has he bled in vain! the <HI>question,</HI> this,</L>
<L>Our duty, int'rest, urge to ask ourselves—</L>
<L>Our all's at stake; be serious; let's enquire—</L>
<L>But oh! lamentable! so vain is man,</L>
<L>Hot in pursuit of riches, fame, or power,</L>
<L>Forgets the business which demands dispatch;</L>
<L>The most momentous business of his life;</L>
<L>On which unfading glory does depend,</L>
<L>Drops, in his thoughts, enduing substance, and</L>
<L>Hunts, fondly, Phantom's train; illusive joys:</L>
<L>Till, or affliction's school, the death-bed shews</L>
<L>His fatal error, by th' approach of woe.</L>
<L>What numbers are there—now, within the walls</L>
<L>Of yon great city, sunk below the brute,</L>
<L>(Nor can the learned Johnson coin a word</L>
<L>Too mean, expressive of nor man nor beast)</L>
<L>Inebriated with nectareous juice</L>
<L>Kind providence to man, to cheer him, gave,</L>
<L>Misus'd, has prov'd his bane, now snoring lays</L>

<L>At least a slumber's lesser aid I beg,</L>
<L>To sooth the pain of conscience, so acute.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, rising generation, deep immers'd</L>
<L>In bellowing waves of passion; mounted high</L>
<L>On folly's giddy heights, ideal joys,</L>
<L>Look down the precipice, the gulph of death,</L>
<L>And look beyond, look to the gulph beneath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, rising generation, leave the stage,</L>
<L>The club of lewdness; to the house descend</L>
<L>Of dying infidels: Behold the King</L>
<L>Of every terror sitting on their brow!</L>
<L>The friend may weep, but cannot help; in vain</L>
<L>He would allay the agony of soul;</L>
<L>Yet can't repress the inward heart-felt pang,</L>
<L>The complicated weight of death and sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, rising generation, now ascend,</L>
<L>And see the King of terrors wear a smile:</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="010355_0028_0F7EA26EAD205288"/>See how the good man meets the shock of death,</L>
<L>Welcomes the messenger, and bids adieu</L>
<L>To all his family around his bed,</L>
<L>Dries up their tears with, <HI>All is well with me.</HI></L>
<L>Take his example, smooth the rugged vale;</L>
<L>Death will be then a glorious path to life.</L>
<L>But when to smooth it? In the day of health:</L>
<L>'Tis our great business, 'tis our happiness;</L>
<L>Th' important work at peril left undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Consider then the end, the glorious end</L>
<L>Of your creation, and pursue the means;</L>
<L>Fill up the duty Heaven has assign'd,</L>
<L>Nor quit your post; an enemy is near:</L>
<L>'Tis youthful lusts that war against the soul,</L>
<L>Cloud reason's eye, and wound e'en while they please.</L>
<L>Let's then assert the dignity of man,</L>
<L>Nor meanly truckle to our appetites,</L>
<L>The impetus of grov'ling brute desire;</L>
<L>Assert our dignity, and reign as kings,</L>
<L>Intelligent, free spirits, cloathed with</L>
<L>An angel's nature, immortality,</L>
<L>Tho' for a moment cloathed with a worm's;</L>
<L>Offspring of Deity, the sons of God;</L>
<L>A higher title can man wish to wear?</L>
<L>A lower then shall man stoop to acquire?</L>
<L>Forfeit his glory, and relinquish man?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, rising generation, take the field,</L>
<L>Nor make delay; duty demands dispatch,</L>
<L>And int'rest urges too; they're both connect,</L>
<L>Man's duty and man's real happiness.</L>
<L>Make no delay, eternity's the prize;</L>
<L>Eternity of pure celestial joy.</L>
<L><HI>Be always ready,</HI> and be always safe.</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="010355_0028_0F7EA26EAD205288"/>Trust to the morrow? This a dreadful risque!</L>
<L>Morrow may be eternity to thee!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The day, the hour, the awful moment, when</L>
<L>Our frame shall fall, no prudence can foresee.</L>
<L>What folly then in man to trust to health,</L>
<L>To strength of nerves a moment may unstring!</L>
<L>A moment parts th' attenuated thread,</L>

<L>A dreary prison to th' immortal soul;</L>

<L>Nor riches, power, nor wisdom can exempt</L>
<L>E'en <HI>Alexanders</HI> from the debt of death.</L>

<LG>
<L>See, silent monitors, the ghastly corpse</L>
<L>Of nearest relative, or bosom friend,</L>
<L>Crush'd by some heavy apoplectic stroke,</L>
<L>Or by a febrile heat intense consum'd,</L>
<L>Or other engines death successful plays</L>
<L>Within the limits of these elements,</L>

<L><HI>Why weep for me?</HI> You weep for me in vain:</L>

<L>We hear the solemn language of the dead,</L>

<L>Say, Ah! he's gone! I knew him in life's bloom!</L>

<L>What! do we start at death? And are we shock'd?</L>
<L>Another truth, and yet more solemn still,</L>

<L>Or, thinking, hast prepar'd against the day,</L>

<L>Or should alarm before it does arrive?</L>

<L>From mortal eye secreted, here are wrote:</L>
<L>These read aloud, e'en infidels must hear,</L>
<L>And hearing, tremble at the dread report.</L>
<L>Not guilty, vain to plead; we're naked, bare;</L>
<L>Discriminating Justice sees our hearts;</L>
<L>One glance explores them; and the prisoner's face,</L>
