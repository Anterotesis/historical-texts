<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS a Piece of fashionable Modesty for an Author to speak meanly of his own Performance; and commonly looked upon as a meer complimental Formality, or an Artifice to gain Applause. Humility is an amiable Virtue in the Eyes of All; and Self-Discommendation, with a View to that Character, is an agree∣able Piece of Self-Denial, even to an ambitious Mind. But the critical and impartial Reader will soon discover so many Imperfec∣tions in the following Poems, that he can hardly suspect my Sinceri∣ty when I assure him, That it is not without Blushing and Diffi∣dence I yield to the Importunity of some of my Friends, to present them to public View. And as to those whose friendly Partiality may cover, or whose Want of Taste may render them insensible of these Imperfections; all Apology is needless.</P>
<P>Sundry of these Poems were fortuitous Productions, formed with∣out any previous Design, and upon no special Occasions. Some of them were intended only as private Memorials of some Meditati∣ons or Occurrences that appeared to me worthy to be retained; and I could think of no more agreeable Method to secure them from Oblivion. Others were written at the Impulse of some sprightly Thought, that perhaps was accidently suggested to my Mind, and allured me to pursue it. Others to improve a vacant Hour on Sa∣turday Evening after Study; and to give me a more lively Impres∣sion of the Subject of Discourse for the ensuing Day. Others as profitable Amusements, and Relaxations from severer Studies. And others to gratify a natural Poetic Taste, or (that I may not give it
<PB N="iv" REF="006834_0003_102A60405CF70230"/>too high a Name) a versifying Humour: And probably this was the origional Spring of my improving the other Occasion, in this Manner.</P>
<P>I was at length determined, tho' not without some remaining Diffidence, to select the following out of sundry others which will probably lie by we in perpetual Oblivion, and consent to their Pub∣lication; and my Reasons may be collected from what follows.</P>
<P>There is in almost all Mankind <HI>an innate Love of Harmony,</HI> which gives those Things that are conveyed to their Minds in a poetical Vehicle a peculiar Relish. This <HI>harmonious Turn of Mind</HI> is the Stamp of Heaven, the Image of the eternal Author of Or∣der; and 'tis He that teaches us to feel the Charms of Poetry:
<Q><L><HI>"From Harmony to Harmony we rise,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"To that superior Skill which turn'd the Spheres;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Gave Melody to</HI> Gabriel<HI>'s heav'nly Lyre,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And every moving Grace to</HI> Milton<HI>'s Song.</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Whatever facred Force in Music lies,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"The dying Strain that calms the wildest Care,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Or loftier Note that prompts to glorious Deeds,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Th' inspiring GOD dwells in the mystic Sound,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And charms and captivates the list'ning Soul,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Thro' all her soft Capacities of Joy.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Letters moral and entertaining, <HI>by that admirable female Wri∣ter, Mrs.</HI> E. Rowe, <HI>Vol. I.

<P>Something correspondent to this appears in the <HI>Order</HI> and Adjust∣ment of the <HI>inanimate Creation;</HI> and hence proceeds much of out Pleasure in the Contemplation of the Works of God.</P>

<P>And no doubt <HI>this,</HI> as well as the other Powers and natural Gusts of the human Mind, was given for valuable Purposes; and ought to be improven as an agreeable Avenue for the Introduction of Divine Things:</P>
<P>'Tis true, it is not equally vigorous in Persons of different Con∣stitutions and Education. It admits of Improvement, as well as the other Faculties of the Soul; and the Disparity will appear ac∣cording to the Strength of the innate Principle, and the Degrees of Cultivation:

<L><HI>"The Lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right."</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pope'<HI>s Essay on Criticism.</HI></NOTE></L></Q>
<P>Persons of a refined and judicious Taste are conscious of peculiar Sensations, when they meet with Entertainment suitable to them. They take but little Notice of those trifling Appendages of Poetry, which are the most agreeable to Persons of a coarse Relish; as the Jingling of Syllables, the Equality of Numbers, the ambiguous Punn, or witty Turn: But they are captivated with the lively Images of Fancy, the Grandeur of Ideas, the Flowers of Language, the Pomp of Style, and the proper Arangement of well-disposed Pe∣riods. Such Readers are imaginary <HI>Actors</HI> of all the Scenes of the Poet's Imagination; and a <HI>Genius</HI> that can write as well as
<PB N="vi" REF="006834_0005_102A60464B566B88"/><HI>they</HI> can read, has an entire Dominion over their Passions. So Dr. <HI>Evans</HI> addresses Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> on his Translation of <HI>Homer:</HI>
<Q><L><HI>"At Will the Master with our Passions plays,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Our Hopes, our Fears, our Joy, our Grief can raise;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Chases, retrieves, with Ease their Force controuls</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Thro' all the secret Windings of our Souls.</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Now we attack, and now we routed fly;</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And in thy Song by turns we live and die.—</HI></L>
<L><HI>"The direful Tumult of the Slaught'ring Fight</HI></L>
<L><HI>"So well you image, and record so right,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"My Fury kindles while the Verse I read,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And Fancy acts each bold heroic Deed."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Sublime Poetry is to such a Series of Transports; and flat and dull, is utterly intolerable; they sicken at the Sight: As nice Pa∣lates have a more lively Relish of an agreeable Dish, and a stronger Disgust to what is nauseous, than Persons of a coarser Taste. And as their Pleasure is more refined; so it is more rare; they are of∣fended where others are pleased, and nauseate what others relish. None but an <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> a <HI>Milton</HI> or <HI>Pope,</HI> can furnish them with proper Entertainment. And may there always be some exalted <HI>Genius</HI> to profit and please such delicate Minds, and refine them for celestial Pleasures, which alone can satisfy their sublime Aspi∣rations!—But I am convinced by a Consciousness of my Incapa∣city, that this does not belong to my Province. If any such should be so curious as to look into the following Poems, and receive them with but <HI>cold</HI> Approbation; I shall gratefully acknowledge it as an Instance of a generous Candour of Taste. Or if they lay them aside, I hope they will do it with that Disposition which we dis∣cover towards the over-officious Attempts of impotent Benevolence; or with that Calmness and Indifferency with which we reject Things that were not intended for our Entertainment or Molestation, but belong wholly to Others.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="006834_0006_102A604959A064F0"/>
But there are few among us of this Character; as there are but few that can write for their Entertainment. And to consult the Advantage of such only, is as unreasonable as if the <HI>English</HI> Legislature should tolerate none but silken Manufactures. The Ge∣nerality of Mankind have neither Opportunity nor perhaps Capacity for these Refinements; and yet are capable of a glorious Immorta∣lity, and the purer Joys of Paradise.—For the Sake of such I write; and to some of them my Essays will not be unacceptable. They may not accurately discern the fairest Charms of Poetry; yet they generally are pleased with the Consonance of final Syllables, pro∣portioned Numbers, &amp;c. So that they are more ready to receive and retain those Things which are conveyed into their Minds in this Form than in heavy and tiresome Prose: For (if the modern Taste will pardon a Citation out of that antiquated divine Wit, <HI>Herbert.</HI>)</P>
<Q><L><HI>"A Verse may hit him whom a Sermon flies,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And turn Delight into a Sacrifice."</HI></L></Q>
<P>On this Account I have frequently thought the Divine Art of Po∣etry might be made peculiarly subservient to the Interests of Religion and Virtue; and lamented the common Prostitution of the heavenly muse to the meanest and most wicked Purposes: 'Tis certainly a Sacrilege that Heaven will avenge; and which lascivious Wits will at last regret. Many of the Conquests of Vice have been owing to this Abuse. This has cloathed her in the most fallacious Charms; and given the Monster a <HI>Syren</HI>'s Voice, to enchant the Unthinking into Ruin. And if we can make Reprizals, and allure Men to the amiable Glories of Holiness, by the proper Use of that Art, which so successfully allured them to embrace even the horrid Charms of Sin; it will be a glorious Enterprize. And may Almighty Grace dispose those whom Nature has animated with this sacred Fire, to kindle it on the Divine Altar! There it glows with the brightest Lustre; and 'tis a Pity it should waste itself away in pestiserous Fumes in the Temple of Vice and Impiety.</P>
<P>There are thousands to attempt the Reformation of Mankind in other more common, and therefore less pleasing Ways; while there
<PB N="viii" REF="006834_0007_102A604B6CE9F878"/>are but few qualified to attempt it in this; and therefore those that are blest with the least Spark of poetic Fire ought not to suf∣focate it.</P>
<P>This is the more necessary, since among the numberless poetical Preductions obtruded on the present Age, there is not, in my Opi∣nion, a becoming Proportion of <HI>Sacred</HI> Poetry. Many indeed have done much Service to the World, and embalmed their Names to Posterity, by their valuable Performances of this Kind. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has given us a Specimen of his Genius for it in his <HI>Sacred Eclogue,</HI> intituled <HI>MESSIAH,</HI> and in sundry Parts of his <HI>Essay on Man.</HI> A very agreeable Spirit of Devotion breathes through Mr. <HI>Thom∣son</HI>'s <HI>Seasons,</HI> and the <HI>Night-Thoughts.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Commonly attributed to Dr.</HI> Young.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> has been of singular Service by his many Divine Composures; and I think Sir <HI>R. Blackmore</HI> may be here mentioned with Respect, notwithstanding the Insults of some superior Wits—Many others might be added to the List: But after all, (not to observe that some of these soar above the Populace) Any One that is versant in modern Poetry will find Reason to complain, that it is too commonly sunk to trivial, and sometimes prophane Subjects; and but seldom assumes those Glories with which it shines, when employ'd on Sacred Themes.—When shall the Divine Fires of Poetry and Devotion flame unitedly to Heaven, and diffuse celestial Fervour through the World!</P>
<P>I do not mean that the Muse should be <HI>wholly</HI> confin'd to <HI>sacred</HI> Things. 'Tis only for a <HI>Proportion</HI> I plead. She might recre∣ate herself in a thousand Excursions through the Credtions of Fan∣cy; but let her seasonably return to the more important Themes she left. War might still thunder in awful Numbers; and Kings and Horbes be immortaliz'd in Song. Wit may exert herself in the various Forms of Ridicule and Satyr, to expose Vice, or the lesser Foibles of Mankind; and the tender Passions may sigh their Sor∣rows, or breathe their Joys, in the most harmonious Lays.—But shall <HI>Mortals</HI> live forever in poetical Monuments, and <HI>THE KING OF KINGS</HI> be unsung? When even a <HI>Heathen</HI> could say,

<P>How are we charmed to see this pious Imprecation in that smooth, sublime Poet Mr. <HI>Thomson!—</HI> An Imprecation harm∣less to <HI>him;</HI> but full of vengeful Thunder, were it adopted by <HI>some.</HI></P>

But to return.—Of those valuable Tracts of sacred Verse which are extant, there are but very few in this Colony in the Hands of common People; and in such a Famine, perhaps these coarse Provisions may not be disagreeable.</P>
<P>I may add, as another Reason of this Publication, that there are but few perhaps of a public Character but what are of some Importance in the Circle of their Friends or Parishoners; who would therefore read their Writings with more Attention and Regard than those of Others that are much more valuable. As this favourable Prepossession furnishes such with particular Opportunities of doing Good in their respective Spheres; they should improve it for that Purpose. 'Tis under this Conviction, and with this grateful In∣tention, I permit this Publication; and may Divine Grace make it subservient for that Purpose!</P>
<P>Yet, that the Advantage may not be limited to my own Denomi∣nation, I have form'd these Poems upon the Footing of catholic Christianity; and avoided all the little angry Peculiarities of a Party: And indeed this was easy, even without explicitly designing it, while I was sitting peaceful in my Study, benevolent to all Man∣kind, wishing the richest Blessings to the Church of CHRIST in every Denomination, unruffled with the Irritations, and unmindful of the Bigotry and Party-Contests of the jangling World. I therefore promise myself None will incur the Character given by a celebrated Poet to partial Readers;

It may be expedient to premise these few Remarks to reflect Light on the Poems, and prepare the Reader for their Perusal.</P>
<P>They are a Collection of <HI>Miscellanies;</HI> not digested into Order according to the Nature of the Subjects: For I was apprehensive a confused Variety would be more entertaining.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Date</HI> of a Poem be generally an insignificant Circum∣stance to the Reader; yet I thought it expedient to annex <HI>That</HI> and the <HI>Text</HI> to the Title of the Poems connected with my public Dis∣courses; that they might be a Hint to my Hearers to help them to recollect the Discourses themselves; and when it is done in some other Cases, I think it needs no Apology.</P>
<P>I have generally used that <HI>Metre</HI> which is most familiar and plain to common Capacities: And where I have indulged myself to imitate the <HI>Heroic</HI> Numbers of <HI>Milton,</HI> or the noble <HI>Licence</HI> of <HI>Pindar</HI> (the last of which is perhaps most natural to me) it was for the most Part before I had any Intention of publishing them.</P>
<P>I have scrupulously avoided those <HI>Invocations of fabulous Deitles,</HI> so common in many of our modern Poets. Nor can the Veneration I have for sundry of those that embellish their Poems with them, convince me that it is an irrational Scrupuosity. I suppose they would not desire to be counted <HI>sincere</HI> in their Devotions; and I think <HI>hypocritical</HI> Devotion, even to a ficticious Deity, is odious. It seems at least an <HI>Affectation</HI> of Idolatry, without the least Temp∣tation. Who, that knew it not before, would suspect those Poets to be profest Christians, who begin, and end, and intermix their Poems with so many warm Petitions, or rapturous Ejaculations to <HI>Apollo,</HI> to <HI>Jove,</HI> to <HI>Venus,</HI> to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and the whole Rabble of Heathenish Gods? Especially when their Devotion to these seems to flame out more frequently than to the GOD that made the Heavens. The Ground of their Error, I conceive, is this, That they cannot imitate or equallize the Antients without adopting their superstitious, non∣sensical and impious Theology (for such that of the Poets generally was.) But (not to insist further on the <HI>moral</HI> Nature of it) does
<PB N="xii" REF="006834_0011_102A6059055C44C8"/>not the <HI>Beauly</HI> and <HI>Propriety</HI> of poetical Descriptions, and parti∣lulatly of Invocations, consist in their Correspondence to the Senti∣ments, Manners and Customs of those for whom we write? But sure, these are not now the same in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as in <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> when <HI>Homer,</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> wrote. The Observation of a noted Critic
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Guardian</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP>. 30.</NOTE> concerning the <HI>English Pastoral-Writers,</HI> is equally pertinent to this —<Q>Our Countryman (says he) have so good an Opinion of the Ancients, and think so modestly of themselves, that the Genera∣lity of Pastoral-Writers have—so servilely imitated the Man∣ner, and Customs of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> as makes them very ridiculous. In looking over some English Pastorals a few Days ago, I—reckoned up at least an hundred left∣handed Ravens, blasted Oaks, withering Meadows, and weeping Deities</Q>—The same Author
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">N<SUP>o</SUP>.</NOTE> blames Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> for borrowing his Names, in his <HI>English</HI> Pastorals, from <HI>Theacritus,</HI> and <HI>Virgil;</HI> and introducing <HI>Daplmis, Alexis</HI> and <HI>Thyrsis</HI> on <HI>British</HI> Plains.—But I humbly conceive, 'tis a greater Impropriety to in∣troduce <HI>foreign Deities</HI> into <HI>English Devotion,</HI> than <HI>foreign Shep∣herds</HI> into <HI>English Pastorals.</HI>—In <HI>Translations</HI> indeed, it is not only tolerable, but sometimes necessary; but in <HI>Original</HI> Poems, it appears to me a very offensive Impropriety.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Milton</HI>'s beautiful Hint at this Impropriety, Par. Lost. B. 7 at the Beginning; where he scruples the very Name of <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ania,</HI> but abso∣lutely renounces the Meaning.</NOTE></P>
<P>To conclude. Shall I seriously request my Reader to peruse these Poems as it becomes a <HI>Mortal?</HI> a <HI>Candidate</HI> for Eternity!— I would not maliciously rob any Man of the seasonable Pleasures of Imagination, or the moderate Gratification of a refined Taste; for no doubt the God that formed us with an innate Relish of these Plea∣sures, allows us to enjoy them: But we <HI>must be temperate in all Things;</HI> and we are in Danger of falling into luxurious Indul∣gences of this, as well as of other natural Apetites. These little De∣licacies do not charm Time to slack his Pace; and Oh!—What
<PB N="xiii" REF="006834_0012_102A605CE1AF2758.tif"/>solemn Scenes open at the Close of it! Scenes, too awful to be turned into Amusements! Ere long,
<Q><L><HI>"Our Souls must leave these Tenements of Clay,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"And to an unknown SOMEWHERE wing their Way."</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Norris!</HI></NOTE></L></Q> Ere long, we shall be advanced to Entertainments infinitely superior to these; or bunished from these and all other Joys. And these Things demand our most <HI>serious</HI> Thoughts.—To <HI>die in Song,</HI> is a plea∣sing Amusement; but Oh!—to <HI>die well in Reality!</HI>—'tis an important, an arduous Business! 'Tis easy for a sprightly Imagi∣nation to entertain itself with lively and moving Representations of the Exercises of a Christian in <HI>this</HI> World, and the substantial Re∣alities of the <HI>next;</HI> but actually to habituate ourselves to the one, and enter upon the other, is a more <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> Thing. To ascend to Heaven in <HI>poetical Flights,</HI> is much easier than to fix our Affections steadily there; and One may paint the Vanity of all Things below, in the most lively Colours; and in the mean Time place his supreme Happiness in them. How much more difficult to adopt the noble Declaration of the sweet Singer of <HI>Israel,</HI> with his Sincerity and Fervour; <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none upon Earth I desire besides Thee.—Thou art the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion forever!</HI></P>
<P>May we therefore make <HI>Religion</HI> our <HI>principal Business</HI> in this Infancy of our Existence! May our Hearts be attempered here, for the heavenly State! that when the solemn Hour of our Exit from these Regions of Mortality comes, we may join the celestial Chair, and spend a happy Eternity in singing the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Lamb!</HI> And may that sovereign GOD, who can <HI>perfect Praise to Himself from the feeble Hosannahs of Babes and Suck∣lings,</HI> make these rude Essays at least of some <HI>small</HI> Service for these important Ends!</P>

<L>MY GOD! the Wretch that does not love Thy Name</L>
<L>To Life and Being forfeits all his Claim,</L>
<L>And may he sink to nothing whence he came.</L>

<L>Oh! if my Heart does not to Thee aspire,</L>

<L>Let not my guilty Breath profane Thy Air,</L>
<L>Nor groaning Earth the monstrous Burden bear.</L>
<L>Let Clouds with Vengeance big, burst o'er my Head,</L>
<L>And Vollies of red Thunder strike me dead.</L>

The Sun convert his gentle Rays to Flames,</L>
<L>And blast the Miscreant with his vengeful Beams.</L>
<L>The whole Creation rise in Arms for Thee,</L>
<L>To vindicate the Rights of Thy Divinity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Vile Wretch! that dare refuse to love a GOD,</L>
<L>Who form'd me Man out of my native Clod;</L>
<L>Whose Breath the Faculty of Love inspir'd,</L>
<L>And with the heav'nly Spark my Bosom sir'd:</L>
<L>Whose uncreated Beauties charm the Sight</L>
<L>Of gazing Angels, in the Realms of Light:</L>
<L>Whose Glories, faintly copy'd, round me shine,</L>
<L>And mildly beam thro' all these Works of Thine,</L>
<L>Proclaiming Thee their Origin Divine:</L>
<L>Whose Grace, diffus'd around in thousand Rills,</L>
<L>Arrays a thousand Worlds in chearful Smiles:</L>
<L>Thou too, when Man to dreadful Ruin fell,</L>
<L>Helpless, unpity'd on the Brink of Hell;</L>
<L>When Justice frowning did the Prey demand,</L>
<L>And None could rescue from his vengeful Hand;</L>
<L>Thou, touch'd with Pity, did'st avert his Doom,</L>
<L>And gav'st Thy Son a Victim in his Room.</L>
<L>Nail'd to the Cross the bleeding Saviour hangs,</L>
<L>And courts my Love with Groans and dying Pangs.</L>
<L>Oh! I must love!—Or can the Groans and Blood</L>
<L>Of an incarnate Godhead be withstood!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet ah! in some dark Hours I hardly know</L>
<L>Whether I love my gracious GOD or no.</L>
<L>Gloomy Suspicions, twinging Jealousies,</L>
<L>And anxious Doubts in all their Horrors rise.</L>
<L>I hear the Whisperings of misgiving Fear,</L>
<L>"Thy Love is feign'd, thy Ardour insincere"</L>
<L><HI>Too true! too true!</HI> my trembling Soul replies,</L>
<L><HI>Else whence so often could this Languor rise?</HI></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="006834_0016_102A606A27BCC678"/>
<HI>Ah! these unruly Passions would not rove</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thus wildly, were they fix'd with sacred Love.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor would the Flame of pure Devotion die</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thus frequent, and my Pow'rs so stupid lie.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet methinks in some bright Moments too,</L>
<L>I feel the heav'nly Flame divinely glow.</L>
<L>To Thee so ardent all my Passions move,</L>
<L>That if I love Thee not, I know not what I love.</L>
<L>If I'm deceiv'd in this with empty Shew,</L>
<L>Then my Existence is uncertain too:</L>
<L>An universal Sceptic I commence,</L>
<L>Beneath the Glare of brightest Evidence,</L>
<L>In spite of Reason, and in spite of Sense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! if I love Thee not, as Fears suggest,</L>
<L>Why am I, in Thine Absence, thus distrest?</L>
<L>Whence this strange Tumult, this uneasy Pain,</L>
<L>'Til Thy sweet Smiles compose my Soul again?</L>
<L>Whence these wild Pantings of immense Desire?</L>
<L>Why should poor breathing Dust so high aspire?</L>
<L>I see my busy Fellow-Worms pursue</L>
<L>Created Bliss, and nothing nobler view;</L>
<L>Content they waste their Life, estrang'd from Thee,</L>
<L>In undisturb'd, serene Stupidity.</L>
<L>And why, like them, can't I contented play,</L>
<L>And eat, and drink, and sleep my Life away?</L>
<L>Whence this immense Ambition in my Mind,</L>
<L>That scorns all Joys but those of heavenly Kind?</L>
<L>Why should a Worm, an animated Clod;</L>
<L>Disdain all Bliss beneath a boundless GOD?</L>
<L>Oh! what but the attractive Force of Love,</L>
<L>Could raise my groveling Spirit thus above?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, Great OMNISCIENT! (for Thou know'st my Heart)</L>
<L>Can Nature ease my Soul, if Thou depart?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="006834_0017_102A606E22943BE0"/>
Can Riches, Pleasures, Honours, Empires, Crowns,</L>
<L>Or Friends, content me, when I feel Thy Frowns?</L>
<L>No! all Creation dwindles to a Toy,</L>
<L>And Heav'n itself could not excite my Joy.</L>
<L>The chearful Sun glares hateful to my Eyes,</L>
<L>And every blooming Beauty round me dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou great INVISIBLE! Thou dear UNKNOWN!</L>
<L>Why thus to Thee should my soft Passions run?</L>
<L>Thus thro' the Objects of my Senses break,</L>
<L>And Charms unknown and hidden Glories seek?</L>
<L>Deep in Recesses of approachless Light</L>
<L>Thou dwellest, far beyond my feeble Sight;</L>
<L>Yet drawn by some strange mystic Influence,</L>
<L>I love Thee more than all that strikes my Sense;</L>
<L>Than all my Ears have heard, or Eyes have seen,</L>
<L>Or lively Fancy's gayest Pow'rs can feign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! if Thy Love does not my Heart inflame,</L>
<L>Why do I thus delight in JESUS' Name?</L>
<L>His Name is Music to my ravish'd Ears,</L>
<L>Sweeter than that which charms the heav'nly Spheres:</L>
<L>A cheering Cordial to my fainting Breast;</L>
<L>My Hope, my Joy, my Peace, my Heav'n, my Rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I spring from Earth, and Heav'n is my Abode,</L>
<L>When I can say those charming Words, MY GOD;</L>
<L>MY GOD!—Infinite Joys lie in the Sound:</L>
<L>Be Thou but mine; and all the Sun goes round</L>
<L>Without reluctant Murm'ring I resign;</L>
<L>I have enough, if I can call Thee MINE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! if I love Thee not, why do I thus</L>
<L>Love the dear Mansion of Thy earthly House?</L>
<L>The sacred Morning shines with heav'nly Rays.</L>
<L>More bright, more charming than ten thousand Days,</L>
<L>That bids me visit that delightful Place.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="006834_0018_102A60700FB58BA0"/>
There would I dwell, and pass my Life away,</L>
<L>'Til Death convey me up to brighter Day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In all the Institutions of Thy Grace,</L>
<L>For Thee I look; and if Thou hide Thy Face,</L>
<L>The sacred Rites would dull and tiresome seem,</L>
<L>Did I not hope to find my GOD in them.</L>
<L>When at Thy Throne I bow my suppliant Knee,</L>
<L>Is Pray'r a stupid cold Formality!</L>
<L>Oh! can my Pray'rs content me without Thee?</L>
<L>No! these are but the Channels of thy Grace,</L>
<L>Transparent Glasses where I see Thy Face:</L>
<L>I thirst for living Water all in vain,</L>
<L>If Thou Thy gracious Influence restrain:</L>
<L>The radiant Glasses shew me nothing fair,</L>
<L>Unless I see Thy Charms reflected there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Peace, my restless and suspicious Heart;</L>
<L>And ye dire-boding Jealousies, depart.</L>
<L>I love my GOD, or else I nothing love;</L>
<L>And the pure Flame e'er long shall burn above,</L>
<L>And from its native El'ment ne'er remove.</L>

<HEAD>II. <HI>Early Piety recommended. (Sent originally in a Letter to two young Ladies.)</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE lovely Flow'rs, that just begin to bloom,</L>
<L>And raise our Hope of glorious Fruit to come;</L>
<L>That just begin to open all your Charms,</L>
<L>While vig'rous Youth your tender Bosoms warms:</L>
<L>Indulge a Muse, that's anxious for your Good,</L>
<L>Lest some rude Storm should blast the op'ning Bud;</L>
<L>Indulge the Muse, that would the Blossoms shield,</L>
<L>'Till they mature, and Fruit immortal yield,</L>
<L>And bloom forever gay in Heaven's fair azure Field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="006834_0019_102A60721ADB2328"/>
<L>Now you begin to tread Youth's slippery Path,</L>
<L>Where Thousands stumble, and sink down to Death.</L>
<L>Where'er you walk, 'tis all enchanted Ground,</L>
<L>And Snares in dang'rous Ambush lurk around.</L>
<L>The flattering World presents her fairest Charms,</L>
<L>And Vice would tempt you to her horrid Arms.</L>
<L>The Crowd of fashionable Sinners aim</L>
<L>To <HI>form you to the Mode,</HI> to walk with them;</L>
<L>Spread false enchanting Scenes before your Eyes,</L>
<L>And promise Bliss from empty Vanities:</L>
<L>While sanguine, forward Youth is still intent</L>
<L>To make the terrible Experiment;</L>
<L>And will not, 'til by dear Experience taught,</L>
<L>Indulge the true, tho' melancholy Tho't,</L>
<L><HI>That all beneath the Sun is Vanity and Nought.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The dang'rous Path of Youth my Feet have trod,</L>
<L>And lately left the smooth enchanting Road:</L>
<L>Now safe advanc'd to a more solid Age,</L>
<L>Let me conduct, you o'er the slippery Stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Trembling I wait th' Event of every Step,</L>
<L>And shudder left you make a fatal Slip.</L>
<L>O! cautious tread: Let Virtue be your Guard:</L>
<L>Virtue alone can keep you un-ensnar'd.</L>
<L>O! chuse your Maker for your early Friend,</L>
<L>And on His gracious Patronage depend:</L>
<L>He can obscure Temptation's brightest Charms,</L>
<L>And shelter feeble Youth from threatning Harms;</L>
<L>Steel the weak Breast with Grace invincible,</L>
<L>And baffle all the Stratagems of Hell.</L>
<L>O! heave the Sigh, waft up the weeping Pray'r</L>
<L>To HIM who loves that Harmony to hear:</L>
<L>He looks and smiles and sheds His richest Grace</L>
<L>On Virgin-Souls that early seek His Face.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="006834_0020_102A60750639DF40"/>
O! let not Earth your tender Hearts ensnare;</L>
<L>Give your first Love to THE ETERNAL FAIR.</L>
<L>'Twas HE, 'twas HE that form'd your mortal Frame,</L>
<L>Inspir'd the living Soul, that heav'nly Flame:</L>
<L>Taught senseless Dust to see and hear and move,</L>
<L>And kindled in the Breast the gentle Pow'r of Love:</L>
<L>But lately, from His all-creating Hand</L>
<L>You came, and sprung to Life at His Command;</L>
<L>'Til then, you lay in native Nothing's Shade;</L>
<L>And but for Him, had still remain'd unmade;</L>
<L>A FATHER's tender Name He bears to you;</L>
<L>And is not your first Love a Father's Due?</L>
<L>O! can your grateful Souls so soon forget</L>
<L>The gracious Pow'r from whence they came so late?</L>
<L>Should not your Bosoms with His Love be fir'd,</L>
<L>Whose Breath the tender Passions all inspir'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He too, when Man to deepest Ruin fell,</L>
<L>Helpless, forlorn on the dire Brink of Hell;</L>
<L>He, touch'd with Pity, and impell'd by Grace,</L>
<L>Sent his own Son to save a guilty Race,</L>
<L>And yield His sacred Soul a Ransom in their Place.</L>
<L>The Infant-GOD did soon begin for you</L>
<L>To bear the Vengeance to your Follies due.</L>
<L>For you the heav'nly Mansions He forsook,</L>
<L>And a vile Stable for His Chamber took.</L>
<L>His Robes of Light Divine aside he threw,</L>
<L>And wrap'd Himself in swaddling Cloaths for you.</L>
<L>Just as He enter'd on the Stage of Life,</L>
<L>He felt the painful circumcising Knife.</L>
<L>In His weak Mother's Arms the young Exile,</L>
<L>From <HI>Herod</HI>'s Rage fled to the Land of <HI>Nile.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE></L>

There rack'd and tortur'd your Redeemer hangs,</L>
<L>And courts your Love with Groans and dying Pangs.</L>
<L>See how He agonizes! see His Blood!</L>
<L>And say, Can such Allurements be withstood?</L>
<L>Oh no! you melt! you yield! I hear you say,</L>
<L>"See, JESUS! here we give our Hearts away!</L>

<L>Strip the gay Year of all her youthful Bloom,</L>
<L>And spread o'er all a cheerless sullen Gloom;</L>
<L>Snow, Rain and Frost commixt, and savage Storms</L>
<L>Ravage and bluster in a thousand Forms;</L>
<L>The smiling World with baleful Influence blast,</L>
<L>And turn these charming Scenes t' a rueful Waste.</L>

<L>Here see your mournful Fate, ye blooming FAIRS;</L>
<L>Stern Death nor Youth nor Strength nor Beauty spares.</L>

The Tyrant, senseless of the Pow'r of Charms,</L>
<L>Hurries the Beauty to reside with Worms;</L>
<L>Covers with mortal Pale the rosy Cheeks,</L>
<L>And dooms the Dust with Fellow-Dust to mix:</L>
<L>Hurries the Soul at once to Worlds unknown,</L>
<L>Doom'd by the Sentence of th' Eternal Throne</L>
<L>To shine with Angels, or with Friends to groan.</L>
<L>Then catch the fleeting Hour before 'tis past;</L>
<L>The present Now perhaps may be your last.</L>
<L>For barren Winter early lay up Store,</L>
<L>That joyful you may meet the fatal Hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Survey the Garden, where the fragrant Rose,</L>
<L>In all the Pride of youthful Beauty glows;</L>
<L>Go, pluck the tempting Flow'r, and pensive say,</L>
<L>"So cruel Death may cut me off to-day."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when the Sun withdraws his quick'ning Ray,</L>
<L>And Ev'ning Shades shut up the cheerful Day;</L>
<L>See! how the flow'ry Tribes their Beauties hide,</L>
<L>And fade and languish in their gayest Pride;</L>
<L>Shrivel their Leaves, and bend the drooping Head;</L>
<L>"So (let your Heart suggest) so I may fade,</L>
<L>"And sudden sink among the mould'ring Dead."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! may the Lustre of your Minds surpass</L>
<L>The with'ring Beauties of the fairest Face:</L>
<L>May every shining Virtue deck your Youth,</L>
<L>And ev'ry heav'nly Grace grow with your Growth;</L>
<L>Life's fleeting Moments glide delightful by,</L>
<L>With every Grace adorn'd, and every Joy;</L>
<L>Till Death, far distant, finding you mature</L>
<L>for Heav'n, convey you up to Joys more pure.</L>

<HEAD>XII. <HI>The universal Lamentation.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though I freely own, it requires a more exalted Muse than mine to manage this tender Subject with suitable Pathos and Energy; yet I hope None will censure the Matter and Scope of the Poem, as savour∣ing of fanatical Affectation.—That the human Soul, tho' the imme∣diate Progeny of the uncreated <HI>Paternal Mind,</HI> (as even a <HI>Heathen</HI> could stile Him) is now surprizingly alienated from its Divine Parent; indis∣posed for the exalted Purposes of its Existence; and under the Tyranny of ignoble Appetites, and criminal Passions; is a lamentable Truth we must assent to, unless we deny our own quickest and most deep-felt men∣tal Sensations.—And that Many indulge themselves in this Depravity, without any eager Aspiration for the Reparation of their noble Nature, now in Ruins; and make it the main Business of this mortal Life, to obey the groveling Dictates, and gratify the impetuous Lusts, of a dege∣nerate Soul; we are ungratefully constrained to believe, by the odious Scenes of Impiety and Prophaneness, that open round us, and impor∣tunately intrude upon our Observation, however willingly we would shun them.—And can there be any Thing so moving, any Thing so just an Object for manly Sorrow, as this? It cannot be justly looked upon as an Instance of effeminate Softness, for the most exalted and dispassionate Mind, to dissolve into the tenderest Sorrows, when it is our common Humanity that demands the sympathising Fear, and prompts the lamenting Groan. The Dignity of the human Soul,—the expensive and Endearing Measures a gracious GOD has been pleased to take for its Recovery,—the ineffable Glories forfeited, and the intole∣rable Miseries incurr'd, by an obstinate Continuance in Sin,—and a thousand other Considerations, render this Degeneracy peculiarly la∣mentable.—And may it not therefore be pertinently improven, as the Occasion for an <HI>Universal Lamentation?</HI> 'Tis natural for a Mind full of tender and vigorous Passions to fall into <HI>Prosopopaeia's,</HI> and to call the inanimate Creation to share its Sensations. Nothing is more common in Passions of Joy and Gratitude; both in sacred and prophane Wri∣ters. Of this the 148 <HI>Psalm,</HI> the Mattin-Song of our first Parents, ac∣cording to <HI>Milton, Thomson</HI>'s Hymn annext to the Seasons, and that surprizing <HI>Apostrophe</HI> in Isai. lxix. 13. are very noble Instances. Thus also the mournful Passions frequently vent themselves, upon various Occasions; and why may they not on this, the most Mournful of all? —St. <HI>Paul</HI> (Rom. viii. 19, 22.) forms a moving <HI>Prosopopaeia</HI> on the Subject of this Poem, with Energy of Language which no Translation can reach.—The whole Creation burfts into an united Groan, and labours with travailing Pangs, ever since Sin reduced it into Slavery, and subjected it to Vanity; and will continue to do so, 'til it partake of the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.—And this Instance, not to mention a Variety of others, is a sufficient Precedent to vindicate the Scope of this Poem.—'Tis certain, if Sin were more lamented, it would be less indulged and practised in the World. And if <HI>Cicero,</HI> con∣sidering the <HI>physical</HI> Evils of Life could say, <HI>(Hoec quidem Vita Mors est, quam lamentari possem.</HI> (Tusc. Disput. L. I.) "This Life is truly Death, which I could lament"; sure, when we survey the <HI>moral</HI> Evils that ruin the immortal Mind, we may breathe out <HI>Jeremiah</HI>'s passionate Wish, <HI>Oh that mike Head were Waters! and mine Eyes Fountains of Tears!</HI> (Jer. ix. 1.)</NOTE></HEAD>

My Heart would break, my Spirit faint away,</L>
<L>To see my <HI>Chara</HI> pallid lifeless Clay.</L>
<L>To hear the Clods with hollow murm'ring Sound</L>
<L>Fall on thy Coffin, would my Soul confound.</L>

<L>And when th' important, solemn Hour draws nigh,</L>
<L>When I must bow my fainting Head and die,</L>
<L>How could I face the Terrors, if thou wert not by?</L>

<HEAD>XXVII. <HI>On hearing of the Rev. Mr.</HI> Samuel Blair'<HI>s desperate Illness by common Fame, and Letter from Correspondents in</HI> Pennsylvania, June 9. 1751.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHAT melancholy News does distant Fame</L>
<L>To anxious Crowds and my shock'd Ears proclaim!</L>
<L>With what strange Panic is each Bosom struck,</L>
<L>As though some Pillar of the Heav'n's were broke!</L>
<L>Alas! is <HI>Blair,</HI> the great, unrival'd <HI>Blair,</HI></L>
<L>Most dear to All, but oh! to me more dear;</L>
<L>My Father! Tutor! Friend! each tender Name</L>
<L>That can the softest, warmest Passions claim!</L>
<L>My faithful Guide to Science and to Truth,</L>
<L>In the raw Years of unexperienced Youth:</L>
<L>Ah! is the heav'nly Man just on the Wing,</L>
<L>And to his native Skies about to spring?</L>
<L>About to leave us mourning here below,</L>
<L>And 'mong us share the Remnant of his Woe?</L>
<L>Ah! does he pine away in <HI>hectic Fire,</HI></L>
<L>Anhelant, panting, ready to expire?</L>
<L>Oh! cruel Fame! why didst thou haste thy Flight,</L>
<L>To bring the inauspicious News to Light?</L>
<L><PB N="132" REF="006834_0143_102A61D68246FA30"/>
Ah! cruel Correspondents! to reveal</L>
<L>The dismal Tidings Love would fain conceal.</L>
<L>Why did not Tears blot out th' Intelligence?</L>
<L>Or your sad Hands tremble to guide your Pens?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! had you not the dismal News divulg'd,</L>
<L>My Mind had still the pleasing Dream indulg'd;</L>
<L>Still seign'd my <HI>Blair</HI> with Health and Vigour blest,</L>
<L>With some grand Purpose labouring in his Breast;</L>
<L>In studious Thought pursuing Truth divine,</L>
<L>'Til the full Demonstration round him shine;</L>
<L>Or from the sacred Desk, proclaiming loud</L>
<L>His Master's Message to th' attentive Crowd;</L>
<L>While dubious Truth with bright Conviction glares,</L>
<L>And coward Error shrinks and disappears;</L>
<L>While Quick Remorse the hardy Sinner feels,</L>
<L>And <HI>Calvary</HI>'s Balm the bleeding Conscience heals.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now alas! the sweet Delusion's fled;</L>
<L>My <HI>Blair</HI> is dying, or perhaps is dead;</L>
<L>Or hast'ning to the calm celestial Shore,</L>
<L>Or safe arriv'd, and all the Dangers o'er.</L>
<L>Even now perhaps, releas'd from cumb'rous Clay,</L>
<L>His Soul expatiates in immortal Day;</L>
<L>Serenely basking in the Smiles of God,</L>
<L>With Fellow-Angels in their blest Abode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pardon, Blest Shade! the Ravings of my Love,</L>
<L>That would recall thee from the Bliss above;</L>
<L>Would wish thee down in these sad Realms again,</L>
<L>From Choirs of Angels to converse with Men;</L>
<L>Ungrateful Men, who broke thy Heart, and long</L>
<L>Withstood the strong Persuasion of thy Tongue;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Love, and Vanity pursu'd,</L>

<L><PB N="133" REF="006834_0144_102A61D925EB7560"/>
Oh! might'st thou from the Dead return again.</L>
<L>And that strange unknown World disclose to Men!</L>
<L>Apostles from the Dead sure could not preach in vain.</L>
<L>Superfluous Wish! What could'st thou teach us more,</L>
<L>Than thy divine Discourses did before?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if in mortal Climes be still thy Stay,</L>
<L>O! can our Pray'rs the fatal Hour delay?</L>
<L>Prevail with Heav'n to spare thy sacred Breath,</L>
<L>And snatch thee from th' impending Hand of Death?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, Saints, your Importunities renew;</L>
<L>Try what th' united Force of fervent Pray'r can do.</L>
<L>Believing Pray'r, eternal Truth has sworn,</L>
<L>Sha'n't pant in vain, but bring a rich Return:</L>
<L>'Twill gain this Blessing from propitious Heav'n;</L>
<L>Or greater, if a greater can be giv'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thou sovereign Arbiter of Life and Death,</L>
<L>"At whose almighty Nod we catch and yield our Breath;</L>
<L>"Whose <HI>fiat</HI> organiz'd our mortal Clay,</L>
<L>"And can repair it in its last Decay,</L>
<L>"And from the greedy Grave snatch the expected Prey:</L>
<L>"Oh! hear the bursting, deep, united Groan,</L>
<L>"That from ten thousand Hearts arises to Thy Throne;</L>
<L>"<HI>Restore our Prophet!</HI>—Best for him, 'tis true,</L>
<L>"To die; but oh! what shall poor <HI>Zion</HI> do?</L>
<L>"<HI>Zion</HI> whose Foes are many, Friends are few!</L>
<L>"See! how she languishes in plaintive Grief;</L>
<L>"By <HI>Blair</HI>'s Recovery only hopes Relief.</L>
<L>"Where shall the wounded, tortur'd Conscience find</L>
<L>"A healing Hand so skilful and so kind?</L>
<L>"Where heav'nly Truth so firm an Advocate?</L>
<L>"Or dubious Minds so certain Conduct get?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"<HI>Restore our Prophet,</HI> and his Health renew;</L>
<L>"For oh! we need him more than Heav'n can do.</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="006834_0145_102A61DAA8CF3C30"/>
"There Myriads of Thy Ministers of Flame</L>
<L>"Perform Thy Orders and adore Thy Name.</L>
<L>"But here, alas! how few prepar'd like <HI>Blair</HI></L>
<L>"Thy sacred Message to the World to bear?</L>
<L>"With equal Skill eternal Things to shew?</L>
<L>"And guide Thy Churches militant below?</L>
<L>"<HI>Restore our Prophet,</HI> Lord! and in his Stead</L>
<L>"Let worthless me be to the Skies convey'd.</L>
<L>"Thy earthly House such useless Lumber may</L>
<L>"Resign; but oh! snatch not our <HI>Blair</HI> away."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But even his Worth now bids us to despair,</L>
<L>And threatens the Denial of our Pray'r;</L>
<L>His Worth that makes his sacred Life so dear.</L>
<L>So great, so heav'nly, so divine a Mind</L>
<L>Demands Employment of a nobler Kind.</L>
<L>What Earth could teach, he learn'd, and now must rise</L>
<L>To a superior Class above the Skies.</L>
<L>Too much refin'd, in this dark World to bear</L>
<L>The humble Place of <HI>Zion</HI>'s Minister;</L>
<L>Heav'n calls him to sustain some nobler Function there:</L>
<L>With <HI>Gabriel</HI> to perform the Orders given,</L>
<L>And bear JEHOVAH's Errands thro' the Vast of Heav'n;</L>
<L>Prompt as th' angelic Armies to obey,</L>
<L>Fervent and bright and vigorous as they.</L>
<L>Heav'n kind to him, will not consent to hear,</L>
<L>Nor curse him with the Answer of our Pray'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! did my cruel Distance but allow,</L>
<L>I'd pay the last sad Offices I owe:</L>
<L>With tender Hand support thy fainting Head,</L>
<L>Wipe off thy mortal Sweat, and weep around thy Bed;</L>
<L>I'd view thee struggling in the Grasp of Death,</L>
<L>And share the Anguish of thy parting Breath;</L>
<L>Thy languishing <HI>Francisca</HI>'s Grief allay,</L>
<L>As drown'd in Tears, she hovers o'er thy Clay;</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="006834_0146_102A61DC368C3BC0"/>
Thy sacred Reliques to the Grave attend,</L>
<L>And cry, <HI>"There softly rest, my Father, Brother, Friend!"</HI></L>
<L>But ah! these Eyes shall see my <HI>Blair</HI> no more,</L>
<L>'Till my poor Pilgrimage, like his, is o'er,</L>
<L>And we both meet on the eternal Shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet though this cruel Distance lies between,</L>
<L>Officious Fancy paints the dismal Scene;</L>
<L>Even now the mournful Images arise,</L>
<L>And various shapes of Sorrow stalk before mine Eyes.</L>
<L>There lies my <HI>Blair,</HI> suffus'd with clammy Sweat,</L>
<L>Ghastly and pale; the Pulses cease to beat;</L>
<L>The Springs of Life relax; the purple Stream</L>
<L>Stagnates; his Eyes in misty Darkness swim;</L>
<L>A deadly Cold creeps on from every Part,</L>
<L>Benumbs his Limbs, and steals upon his Heart:</L>
<L>And see at length in a long deep-fetch'd Groan</L>
<L>The Soul's dismist, and flies to Worlds unknown.</L>
<L>Delug'd in Sorrow, there <HI>Francisca</HI> stands,</L>
<L>And twing'd with parting Anguish, wrings her Hands;</L>
<L>Like the poor widow'd Turtle, vents her Grief,</L>
<L>Her Tears indulges, and despairs Relief;</L>
<L>Surveys the World, but sees no Refuge there,</L>
<L>Her only Confidence in Heav'n and Pray'r.</L>
<L>Thy infant Train, whose little Tongues had scarce</L>
<L>Learn'd to pronounce thee <HI>Father,</HI> at thy Hearse,</L>
<L>Or round thy Bed, burst their full Hearts in Sighs,</L>
<L>While the big Tear sincere swells in their Eyes,</L>
<L>And their loud filial Griefs break out in piteous Cries.</L>
<L>Through thy once favour'd Flock the Sorrow spreads,</L>
<L>And desp'rate Grief a thousand Hearts invades:</L>
<L>Each fears lest 'twas his Guilt that did provoke</L>
<L>Incensed Heav'n to give the dreadful Stroke.</L>
<L>Now 'mong the Remnant of the sacred Train</L>
<L>They search for one to fill his Place in vain.</L>
<L><PB N="136" REF="006834_0147_102A61E3903EDFE0"/>
Compar'd with him, the most exalted Tongue,</L>
<L>But mangles Truth, and does the Subject Wrong.</L>
<L>From others heav'nly Truths insipid seem</L>
<L>To them whose Relish was refin'd by him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still farther spreads th' extensive Grief around</L>
<L>Each Bosom feels the Anguish of the Wound,</L>
<L>And bursting Groans from Breast to Breast rebound</L>
<L><HI>Zion</HI> her Loss through all her Temples wails,</L>
<L>And spreads the dismal Eccho round her Hills.</L>
<L>To this far Clime the mournful Sound shall roll,</L>
<L>And with fresh Anguish twinge my bleeding Soul.</L>
<L>His dear sad Mem'ry on my Heart shall rest,</L>
<L>While vital Breath inspires my heaving Breast;</L>
<L>Mix with my tender'st Thoughts, and often move</L>
<L>The doleful Anguish of bereaved Love,</L>
<L>'Till our Reunion heals the Wound Above.</L>
</LG>
<P>Since the Writing of this, I have received the melancholy News of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Blair</HI>'s triumphant and joyful Tran∣sition through the Valley of the Shadow of Death—<HI>My Father! my Father! the Chariots of</HI> Israel, <HI>and the Horse-Men thereof!</HI></P>
