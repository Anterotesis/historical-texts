<HEAD>The GOVERNOUR's Speech to the <HI>Assembly,</HI> at Philadelphia the 15 <HI>September</HI> 1701.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot be more concerned than I am at the frequency of your service in <HI>Assembly,</HI> since I am very sensible of the Trouble and <HI>Charge</HI> it Contracts upon the Country: But the Motives being considered, and that <HI>You</HI> must have met of Course in the next <HI>Month,</HI> I hope you will not think it a Hardship now. The reasons that has<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n your Sessions, is the Necessity I am under, through the Endeavours of the E∣nemies of the PROSPERITY of this <HI>Country,</HI> to go for ENGLAND; where taking Advantage of my Absence, some have attempted, by false or unrea∣sonable Charges, to <HI>undermine</HI> our <HI>Government,</HI> and thereby the true va∣lue of our <HI>Labours</HI> and <HI>Property, Government</HI> having been our first Encoura∣gement. I Confess I cannot think of such a <HI>Voyage</HI> without great Reluc∣tancy of mind, having promised my self the quietness of a <HI>Wilderness,</HI> and that I might stay so long at least with you, as to render every Body in∣tirely easie and safe: For my <HI>Heart</HI> is among you as well as my <HI>body,</HI> what ever some people may please to think: and no <HI>unkindness,</HI> or <HI>disappoint∣ment</HI> shall (with submission to God's <HI>Providence</HI>) ever be able to alter my <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Country,</HI> and Resolution to return and settle my Family and Posterity in it; but having reason to believe I can at this time best serve <HI>you</HI> and <HI>myself</HI> on that side of the Water, neither the rudeness of the season nor Tender Circumstances of my <HI>Family</HI> can over-rule my Inclinations to undertake it.</P>
<P>Think therefore, (since all men are <HI>Mortal</HI>) of some suitable Expedient and Provision for your Safety, as well in your <HI>Priviledges</HI> as <HI>Property,</HI> and you will find me ready to Comply with whatsoever may render us happy by a nearer Union of our Interests.</P>
<P>Review again your <HI>Laws,</HI> propose New ones that may better your Circumstances; and what you do, do it quickly, remembring that the <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI> sits the end of the next <HI>Month,</HI> and that the sooner I am there, the safer I hope we shall be here.</P>
<P>I must recommend to your Serious Thoughts &amp; Care the <HI>Kings</HI> Letter to me, for the Assistance of <HI>New-York,</HI> with <HI>Three-hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty pounds Sterling,</HI> as a Frontier <HI>Government,</HI> and therefore Exposed to a much greater expence in proportion to other <HI>Colonies;</HI> which I call'd the last <HI>Assembly</HI> to
<PB REF="001017_0002_0FAEEDE1598F9440"/>take into their Consideration, and they were pleased for the reasons then given, to refer to this</P>
<P>I am also to tell you the good News of the <HI>Governour</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> his happy Issue of his Conferences with the five Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> that he hath not only made Peace with them, for the <HI>Kings</HI> Subjects of that <HI>Colony,</HI> but (as I had by some Letters before <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m) for those of all other <HI>Governments</HI> under the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of <HI>England</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of <HI>America,</HI> as also the <HI>Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> within those Respective <HI>Colonies,</HI> which cer∣tainly Merits our Acknowledgements.</P>
<P>I have done, when I have told you, that Unanimity and Dispatch are the Life of Business, and that I desire and expect from you, for your own sakes, since it may so much Contribute to the Disappointment of those, that too long have sought the Ruine of our Young <HI>Country.</HI></P>

<P>WHe have this day in our Assembly, read thy speech delivered (Yesterday) in <HI>Council,</HI> and having duly considered the same cannot but be under a deep sense of sorrow for thy purpose of so speedily leaving us, and at the same time taking Notice of thy Paternal regard to us and our <HI>Posterity,</HI> the <HI>Freeholders</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> and <HI>Territories</HI> annexed, in thy Loving and Kind Expressions of being ready to Comply with what soever Expedient and Provisions we shall offer for our Safety as well in <HI>Priviledges</HI> as <HI>Property</HI> and what else may render us happy in a nearer Union of our Interests; Not doubting the performance of what thou hast been Pleased so Loving∣ly to promise, do in much Humility and as a token of our Gratitude, return unto them the unfeigned Thanks of this <HI>House.</HI></P>
