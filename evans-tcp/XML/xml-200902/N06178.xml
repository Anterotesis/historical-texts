<P>THE ANARCHY OF THE RANTERS, And other LIBERTINES; THE HIERARCHY OF THE ROMANISTS, AND OTHER Pretended CHURCHES, equally refused and re∣futed, in a two-fold <HI>Apology</HI> for the Church and People of God, called in Derision, <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SUCH</HI> is the Malignity of Man's Nature in his <HI>fallen State,</HI> and so averse is he from walk∣ing in the <HI>straight</HI> and <HI>even Path</HI> of <HI>TRUTH,</HI> that at every Turn he is inclinable to lean either to the Right-hand or to the Left; yea, such as by the Work of God's Grace in their Hearts, and powerful Operation of his Spirit, have obtained an Entrance in this Way, are daily molested, and set upon on all Hands; some striving to draw them the one Way, some she other: And if through the Power of God they be kept <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>stable,</HI> then are they ca∣luminated on both Sides; each likening or compar∣ing them to the Worst of their Enemies.</P>
<P>Those that are acquainted with the <HI>Holy Scrip∣tures,</HI> may observe this to be the Lot of the Saints in all Ages; but especially those, whose Place it hath been to <HI>reform</HI> and <HI>restore</HI> the Ruins of the House of God, when decayed, or any considerable Time have been liable to such Censures: Hence those that set about repairing of the Walls of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> were necessitated to work with the one Hand, and defend with the other.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="007840_0003_102DB56423330068"/>
Christ is accused of the <HI>Jews</HI> as a <HI>Samaritan;</HI> and by the <HI>Samaritans</HI> quarrelled for being a <HI>Jew.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> is whipped and imprisoned by the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and upbraided with being a <HI>Jew,</HI> and teaching their Customs; the same <HI>Paul</HI> is hawled, and ready to be killed by the <HI>Jews,</HI> for breaking the Law, and defiling the Temple with the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The like hath also befallen these <HI>faithful Witnesses</HI> and <HI>Messengers,</HI> whom God has raised up in this Day to witness for his Truth, which hath long been in a great Measure hid; but now is again revealed, and many brought to be Witnesses of it, who thereby are come to <HI>walk in the Light of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This People thus gathered, have not wanted those Trials, that usually accompany the Church of Christ, both on the Right-hand, and on the Left, each cha∣racterizing them in such Terms, as they have judged would prove most to their Disadvantage. From whence (as the Testimony of the false Witnesses against our Lord did not agree neither do these against us) some will have us to be <HI>foolish, mad Creatures;</HI> others to be <HI>deep, subtil Politicians;</HI> some to be <HI>illiterate, ignorant Fellows;</HI> others to be <HI>learned, cunning Jesuits,</HI> under a meer Vizard: Divers Professors will have us to be only <HI>Pensioners of the Pope,</HI> undoubtedly <HI>Papists;</HI> but the Papists abhor us as <HI>He∣reticks:</HI> Sometimes we are a <HI>dis∣orderly, confused Rabble,</HI> leav∣ing every one to do as they list, against all good <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Go∣vernment;</HI> at other Times we <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John Owen <HI>charges us with so much Igno∣rance, that tho' he writes against us in</HI> Latin, <HI>he fears we will not understand it. And</HI> Thomas Dansen <HI>about the same time accu∣ses us of being</HI> Jesuits, <HI>sent from abroad under this Vizard.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="v" REF="007840_0004_102DB535F16B0428"/>
are so much for Order, as we admit not Men to ex∣ercise the Liberty of their own Judgments. Thus are our Reputations tossed by the Envy of our Ad∣versaries; which yet cannot but have this Effect upon sober-minded People, as to see what MALICE works against us; and how these Men, by their contradictory Assertions concerning us, save us the Pains, while they <HI>refute one another.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, we have laboured to walk amidst these Extremities; and upon our appearing for the Truth, we have found Things <HI>good</HI> in themselves <HI>abused</HI> on both Hands: For such hath always been the Work of an <HI>Apostacy,</HI> to keep up the <HI>Shadow</HI> of certain <HI>Truths;</HI> that there-through they might shel∣ter other <HI>Evils.</HI> Thus the <HI>Jews</HI> made use of the Law and the Prophets to vindicate their <HI>Abuses;</HI> yea, and to crucify <HI>Christ:</HI> And how much many <HI>Christians</HI> abuse the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and the <HI>Traditions</HI> of the Apostles, to uphold Things quite contrary to them, will in the General be readily acknowledged by most.</P>
<P>But to descend more particularly; There be <HI>two Things</HI> especially, both of which in their primitive Use were appointed; and did very much contribute towards the Edification of the Church: The one is,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Power and Authority, which the Apostles had given them of Christ, for the gathering, building up, and govern∣ing of his Church; by Virtue of which Power and Authority they also wrote the Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The other is, <HI>That Privilege given to every Christian under the Gospel, to be led and guided by the Spirit of Christ, and to be taught thereof in all Things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="007840_0005_102DB567674A3E28"/>
Now, both these in the Primitive-Church wrought effectually towards the same End of <HI>Edification;</HI> and did (as in their Nature they may, and in their, Use they ought to do) in a good Harmony very well consist together: But by the Workings of Satan, and Perverseness of Men, they are made to fight against and destroy one another. For on the one Hand the <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> that resided in the Apostles, while it is annexed and entailed to an outward Or∣dination and Succession of Teachers, is made Use of to cloak and cover all Manner of Abuses, even the Height of <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Superstition.</HI> For by Vir∣tue of this Succession these Men claiming the like <HI>Infallibility,</HI> that was in the Apostles (though they be Strangers to any inward Work or Manifestation of the Spirit in their Hearts) will needs oblige all others to acquiesce and agree to their <HI>Conclusions,</HI> however different from, or contrary to, the Truths of the Gospel; and yet for any to call such Conclu∣sions in Question, or examine them, is no less than a <HI>heinous Heresy,</HI> deserving <HI>Death,</HI> &amp;c. Or while the Revelation of God's Mind is wholly bound up to these Things already delivered in the Scrip∣tures (as if God had spoke his <HI>last Words</HI> there to his People) we are put with our own <HI>natural Understandings</HI> to debate about the Meanings of them, and forced to interpret them, not as they plainly speak, but ac∣cording to the Analogy of a cer∣tain Faith made by Men, not so much contrived to answer the Scriptures, as the Scriptures are strained to vindicate it; which to doubt of, is also counted <HI>Heresy,</HI> deserving no less <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>So faith</HI> James Durham, <HI>a noted Man among the</HI> Presbyterians, <HI>in his Exposition up∣on the</HI> Revela∣tions.</NOTE>
<PB N="vii" REF="007840_0006_102DB537AA0942D0"/>
than Election out of our native Country, and to be robbed of the common Aid our Nativity entitles us to. And on this Hand, we may boldly say, both <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> have greatly gone aside.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, some are so great Pretenders to <HI>inward Motions</HI> and <HI>Revelations of the Spirit,</HI> that there are no Extravagancies so wild, which they will not cloak with them; and so much are they for every One's following their own Mind, as can admit of no <HI>Christian Fellowship</HI> and <HI>Community,</HI> nor of that good <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> which the Church of Christ never was, nor can be without. This gives an open Door to all <HI>Libertinism,</HI> and brings great Reproach to the Christian Faith. And on this Hand have foully fallen the <HI>German Ana∣baptists,</HI> so called, <HI>John of Leyden, Knipperdolling,</HI> &amp;c. (in Case these monstrous Things committed by them be such as they are related) and some more moderate of that Kind have been found among the People in <HI>England,</HI> called <HI>Ranters:</HI> As it is true, the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> have been branded with both of these Extreams; it is as true, it hath been and is their Work to avoid them; and to be found in that even and good Path of the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> where all were (no doubt) led and acted by the Holy Spirit; and might all have <HI>prophesied one by one;</HI> and yet there was a <HI>Subjection of the Prophets to the Spirits of the Prophets.</HI> There was an <HI>Authority</HI> some had in the Church, and yet it was for <HI>Edification,</HI> and not for <HI>Destruction:</HI> There was an <HI>Obedience in the Lord</HI> to such as were set over; and a being taught by such, and et a knowing of the <HI>inward Anointing,</HI> by which ach Individual was to be led into all Truth. The

Work and Testimony the Lord hath given us is, to restore this again, and to set both these in their right Place, without causing them to destroy one another. To manifest how this is accomplished, and accomplishing among us, is the Business of this Trea∣tise; which, I hope, will give some Satisfaction to Men of sober Judgments, and impartial and unpre∣judicate Spirits; and may be made useful in the good Hand of the Lord, to confirm and establish Friends against their present Opposers; which is mainly intended, and earnestly prayed for, by</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>The Introduction and Method of this Treatise.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The End of the Law and Beginning of the Gospel-Dispensation recited.</NOTE> AFTER that the Lord God in his own appointed Time had seen meet to put an End to the Dispensation of the Law, which was delivered to the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> by the Mini∣stry of <HI>Moses;</HI> through and by whom he did communicate unto them in the Wilderness from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> divers Commandments, Ordinances, Appointments and Observations, according as they are testified in the Writings of the Law; it pleased him to send his own Son the Lord Jesus Christ in the Fulness of Time; who ha∣ving perfectly fulfilled the Law, and the Righ∣teousness thereof, gave Witness to the Dispen∣sation of the Gospel. And having approved himself, and the Excellency of his Doctrine, by
<PB N="2" REF="007840_0009_102DB56B93FED5E0"/>
many great and wonderful Signs and Miracles, he sealed it with his Blood; and triumphing over Death (of which it was impossible for him to be held) he cherished and encouraged his despised Witnesses, who had believed in him, in that he appeared to them, after he was raised from the Dead; comforting them with the Hope and Assurance of the <HI>pouring forth of his Spirit,</HI> by which they were to be led and ordered in all Things; in and by which, he was to be with them to the End of the World, not suffering the Gates of Hell to prevail against them. By which Spirit come upon them, they being filled, were emboldned to preach the Gospel without Fear; and, in a short Time, Thousands were ad∣ded to the Church; and the Multitude of them that believed, were of one Heart, and of one Soul, and great Love and Zeal prevailed, and there was nothing lacking for a Season.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The divers Sorts of them that were cal∣led in the Apostles Days.</NOTE> But all that were caught in the Net, did not prove good and wholesome Fish; some were again to be cast into that Ocean, from whence they were drawn: Of those many that were called, all proved not chosen Ves∣sels, fit for the Master's Use; and of all that were brought into the great Supper and Marriage of the King's Son, there were that were found without the Wedding-Garment.—Some made a shew for a Season, and afterwards fell away; there were that drew back; there were that made Shipwreck of Faith, and of a good Conscience: There were not only such as did backslide themselves, but sought to draw
<PB N="3" REF="007840_0010_102DB5AEC42320B8"/>
others into the same Perdition with themselves, seeking to overturn their Faith also; yea, there were that brought in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them. And also of those Members that became not wholly cor∣rupt (for some were never again restored by Re∣pentance) there were that were weak, and sickly, and young; some were to be fed with Milk, and not with strong Meat; some were to be purged, when the old Leaven received any Place; and some to be cut off for a Season, to be shut out (as it were) of the Camp for a Time, until their Leprosy was healed, and then to be received in again.</P>
<P>Moreover, as to <HI>Outwards,</HI> there was the Care of the Poor, of the Widow, of the Fatherless, of the Strangers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore the Lord Jesus Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Order in the Church of God in the Outward.</NOTE> who is the Head of the Body, the Church (for the Church is the Body of Christ, and the Saints are the several Mem∣bers of that Body) knowing in his infinite Wis∣dom, what was needful for the good ordering and disposing all Things in their proper Place, and for preserving and keeping all Things in their right Station, did, in the Dispensation and Com∣munication of his Holy Spirit, minister unto every Member, a <HI>Measure of the same Spirit,</HI> yet diverse according to Operation, for the Edification of the Body; some Apostles, some Teachers, some Pastors, some Elders: There are old Men, there are young Men, there are Babes. For all are not Apostles, neither are all Elders, neither are all Babes; yet are all Members: And as such,
<PB N="4" REF="007840_0011_102DB56D1D487D90"/>
all have a Sense and Feeling of the Life of the Body, which, from the Head, flows unto all the Body, <HI>as the Ointment of</HI> Aaron<HI>'s Beard, unto the Skirts of his Garment:</HI> And every Member has its Place and Station in the Body, so long as it keeps in the Life of the Body; and all have need one of another; yet is no Member to assume another Place in the Body, than God has given it; nor yet to grudge or repine its follow Mem∣ber's Place; but to be content with its own: For the uncomely Parts are no less needful than the comely; and the less honourable than the more honourable; which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> holds forth in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. from Verse 13 to 30.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ground of Rents and Divisions.</NOTE> Now the Ground of all Schisms, Divisions or Rents in the Body is, when as any Member assumes ano∣ther Place than is allotted it; or being gone from the Life and Unity of the Body, and losing the Sense of it, lets in the Murmur∣er, the Eye that watches for Evil, and not in holy Care over its Fellow Members: And then, instead of coming down to <HI>Judgment in itself,</HI> will stand up and <HI>judge its Fellow Members,</HI> yea, the whole Body, or those whom God has set in a more honourable and eminent Place in the Body than itself. Such suffer not the Word of Ex∣hortation; and term the Reproofs of Instruc∣tion (which is the Way of Life) <HI>Imposition</HI> and <HI>Oppression,</HI> and are not aware how far they are in the Things they condemn others for; while they spare not to reprove and revile all their Fellow Members: Yet if they be but ad∣monished
<PB N="5" REF="007840_0012_102DB5B163EC55B8"/>
themselves, they cry out, as if their great Charter of Gospel Liberty were broken.</P>
<P>Now though such, and the Spirit by which they are acted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Subtilty of that Spi∣rit.</NOTE> be sufficient∣ly seen and felt by Thousands, whose Hearts God has so established, as they are out of Danger of being intangled in that Snare, and who have Power and Strength in themselves to judge that Spirit, even in its most subtil Appearances; yet there are, who can∣not so well withstand the Subtilty, and seeming Sincerity some such pretend to, though in Mea∣sure they have a Sight of them; and others, that cannot so rightly distinguish between the Preci∣ous and the Vile; and some there are that through Weakness, and want of true Discerning, may be deceived, and the Simplicity in them betrayed for a Season; as it is written, <HI>With fair Speeches and smooth Words, they deceive the Hearts of the Simple.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore having, according to my Measure, received an Opening in my Understanding as to these Things, from the Light of the Lord, and having been for some Time under the weighty Sense of them, I find at this Instant a Freedom to commit them to Writing, for the more uni∣versal Benefit and Edification of the Church of Christ.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heads treated of, <HI>viz.</HI></NOTE> for the more plain and clear Opening and Understanding of these Things, it is fit to sum up this Trea∣tise in these following general Heads, to be considered of:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="007840_0013_102DB5722570A7E0"/>I. First, <HI>From whence the Ground and Cause of this Controversy is, the Rise and Root of it?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Secondly, <HI>Whether there be now any Order and Government in the Church of Christ?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Thirdly, <HI>What is the Order and Government which we plead for? In what Cases, and how far it may extend? In whom the Power decisive is, and how it differeth? And is wholly another, than the oppressing and persecuting Principality of the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>and other Antichristian Assemblies.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>Concerning the Ground and Cause of this</HI> CON∣TROVERSY.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>first Dawning</HI> of the heavenly Day of the Lord described.</NOTE> WHEN as the Lord God by his mighty Power began to visit the Nations with the Dawn∣ing of his heavenly Day (for thus I write unto those that have received and believed the Truth) and that he sent forth his Instruments, whom he had fitted and prepared for his Work, having fashioned them not according to the Wisdom and Will of Man, but to his own heavenly Wisdom and Counsel, they went forth and preached the Gospel in the Evi∣dence and Demonstration of the Spirit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">And break∣ing forth.</NOTE> Not in the enticing Words of Man's Wisdom; but in Appear∣ance
<PB N="7" REF="007840_0014_102DB5B4F37CE0B0"/>
as Fools and Mad, to those that judged ac∣cording to Man. But their Words and Testi∣mony pierced through into the inner Man in the Heart, and reached to that of God in the Con∣science; whereby as many as were simple-hearted, and waited for the Redemption of their Souls, received them as the Messengers of the most high God; and their Words were unto them, not as the Words of Men, but as the Words of God; for in the receiving and embracing the Testimo∣ny of Truth through them, they felt their Souls eased, and the acceptable Day began to dawn in and upon them.</P>
<P>Now what Evidence brought these Men to make their Testimony to be received? Did they entice? Did they flatter? Did they daub up? Did they preach Liberty to the Flesh or Will of Man? Nay verily, they used no such Method: Their Words were as Thunder-Bolts, knocking down all that stood in their Way, and pouring down the Judgment of God upon the Head of the Trans∣gressor every where. Did they spare the zealous Professor more than the open Profane? Nay veri∣ly, they condemned equally the Hypocrisy of the one, as well as the Profanity of the other; yet wanted they not Regard to the tender Seed and Plant of God in either. Did they give way? Did they yield to the Wisdom of Man? To the De∣ceitfulness of the Serpent, that would reason Truth for themselves, saying, <HI>I must stay, until I be convinced of this, and that, and the other Thing; I see not yet this to be wrong, or the other Thing to be my Duty?</HI> How did they knock down this Man∣ner of Reasoning by the Spirit of God, which
<PB N="8" REF="007840_0015_102DB57551B17EC8"/>
wrought mightily in them, shewing and holding forth, that this is the Day of the Lord that is dawned; that all are invited to come; that none ought to tarry behind; that that which so pleadeth is the same Spirit which of old Time said in those that were invited, <HI>I cannot come yet, I must first marry a Wife; I must go prove my Yoke of Oxen; I must go visit my Possessions; let me first bury my dead Father.</HI> Did not the Lord through them testify and declare against these Things? And is there not a Cloud of Witnesses, who felt the Enemy thus reasoning to keep us in the Forms, Fellowships; false Worships, and foolish Fashions of this World? But we felt, as we were obedi∣ent, all these Things to be for Condemnation; and that, as we obeyed the pure Manifestation of the Light of Jesus in our Hearts, there was no He∣sitation. We might and should have parted with all those Things at the First; and what occasion∣ed such Scruples, was but that which drew back, through being unwilling to give pure Obedience to the Cross of Christ: For as many as gave Obe∣dience and believed in the Light, found no Oc∣casion of stumbling; but such as believed not were condemned already, because they believed not in him that appeared. Now the Boldness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Courage of the Mes∣sengers.</NOTE> and Courage, and Effica∣cy of these Messengers Testimony, wrought such Astonishment, Fear and Amazement in the Hearts of such as were ingenuous, that many began to be inwardly pricked, as in the Days of old, and the Foundations of many began to be shaken; and some that were asleep were awakened, and many that were dead and buried in the Graves of Sin,
<PB N="9" REF="007840_0016_102DB5B6E99F9808"/>
and Formality, and Superstition, and Idolatry of all Sorts, were alarmed; and many were brought in from the Hedges, and the High-Ways, and the Truth was received by Thousands with great Cheerfulness, and a Readiness of Mind: And the Feet of those were beheld to be beautiful upon the Mountains, that brought the glad Tidings of these good Things. And great Lowliness and Simplicity of Heart was upon such that were newly convinced of the Truth, and deep Humi∣liation of Spirit, and Subjection to the Power, both in themselves, and in those who were over them in the Lord, and had gathered them into the Truth.</P>
<P>But as it was in the Gatherings of old, so it also sell out in this Day; all kept not their first Love: As among those Thousands, which <HI>Moses</HI> led out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and carried through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> who had sung Praises to God upon the Banks of Salvation, many Carcases fell in the Wilder∣ness; some who murmured and longed to return again to the Flesh-Pots of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and some for opposing and contradicting the Servant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Opposition and—</NOTE> and Servants of the Lord, whom the Lord had made Use of to lead them out of Bondage, in saying, <HI>Ye take too much upon you; Hath the Lord indeed only spoken by</HI> Moses? <HI>Hath he not spoken also by us?</HI> And as among these Multitudes, which were gathered by the Apostles, there were many who continued not faithful to the End; some returned back a∣gain with the Sow to the Puddle, after they were washed: some embraced the present World; some again separated them∣selves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">—Separation entring.</NOTE> being sensual, and without the Spirit, <HI>despising Dominion, and
<PB N="10" REF="007840_0017_102DB576E322A4E8"/>
speaking Evil of Dignities;</HI> their Mouths speak∣ing great swelling Words, being puffed up, and not abiding in these Things, which they were taught of the Apostles: So it is to be lamented, that among these many Thousands, whom the Apostles and Evangelists whom God raised up in <HI>This</HI> Day (for the gathering of his Seed and Peo∣ple out of spiritual <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Babylon</HI> into his pure Light and Life) did bring forth and gather, there are that have fallen upon the Right-hand and the Left. Some are turned back again into <HI>Egypt,</HI> running into the same Excess of Lust and Riot, from whence they were once purified and redeemed: Some could not bear the Reproach of the Cross of Christ; and were by and anon offended in him: Some could not bear the Tri∣bulations, Sufferings and Persecutions, which came for the Truth's Sake; and the Seed in them was soon scorched with the Heat of the Day. And some not abiding in Subjection to the Truth in themselves, were not contented with that Place and Station in the Body, which God had placed them in; but became vainly puffed up in their fleshly Minds, intruding into those Things which they have not seen: And would needs be <HI>Innova∣tors,</HI> given to Change, and introducing new Doctrines and Practices, not only differing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovators causing Di∣visions.</NOTE> but contrary to what was already delivered in the Beginning; making Parties, causing Divisions and Rents, stumbling the Weak, and denying, de∣spising and reviling the Apostles and Messengers of Christ, the Elders of the Church, who loved not their Lives unto Death, but through much
<PB N="11" REF="007840_0018_102DB5B8A1197ED8"/>
Care, and Travel, and Watchings and Whippings and Bonds, and Beatings, in daily Jeopardy, gathered us by the mighty Power of God into the most precious Truth.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Church Or∣der and Go∣vernment granted.</NOTE> IN Answer to this <HI>Proposition,</HI> I meddle not at this time with those that deny any such thing as a Church of Christ; I have reserved their Plea to another Place. Neither need I to be at much Pains to prove the Affir∣mative, to wit, <HI>That there ought to be Government and Order in the Church of Christ,</HI> unto the Genera∣lity of our Opposers, both <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants;</HI> who readily confess and acknow∣ledge it, and have heretofore blamed us for want of it. Tho' now some of them, and that of the highest Pretenders, are become so unreasonable, as to accuse us for the Use of it; improving it, so far as they can, to our Disadvantage: For such is the Blindness of partial Envy, that whereas the supposed Want of it was once reckoned heretical, now the present Performance of it is counted criminal.</P>
<P>These, then, to whom, I come to prove this Thing, are such, who having cast off the Yoke of the Cross of Christ in themselves, refuse all <HI>Sub∣jection</HI> or <HI>Government:</HI> Denying that any such thing ought to be, as disagreeing with the Testi∣mony of Truth; Or those, who not being so wil∣ful and obstinate in their Minds, yet are fearful or scrupulous in the Matter, in respect of the dangerous Consequences, they may apprehend, such a Thing may draw after it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007840_0022_102DB5BF9D8C6460"/>
For the clearing then as well the Mistakes of the one, as answering the Cavils of the other, I judge the Truth of these following Assertions will sufficiently prove the Matter; which I shall make no great Difficulty to evidence.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">Reason I.</NOTE>First <HI>That Jesus Christ, the King and Head of the Church, did appoint and or∣dain, that there should be Order and Government in it.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">II.</NOTE>Secondly, <HI>That the Apostles and primitive Christians, when they were filled with the Holy Ghost, and immediately led by the Spirit of God, did practise and commend it.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE>Thirdly, <HI>That the same Occasion and Ne∣cessity now occurring, which gave them Op∣portunity to exercise that Authority, the Church of Christ hath the same Power now as ever, and are led by the same Spirit into the same Practices.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Abuse makes not void the true Use.</NOTE>As to the <HI>First,</HI> I know there are some, that the very Name of a Church, and the very Words, Order and Government, they are afraid of. Now this I suppose hath proceeded, because of the great Hy∣pocrisy, Deceit and Oppression, that hath been cloaked with the Pretence of these Things; but why should the Truth be neglected, because Hypocrites have pre∣tended to it? The right Institution of these Things, which have been appointed and ordained of God, must not, nor ought not to be despised, because cor∣rupt Men have abused and perverted them. I know not any thing that hath been more abu∣sed and perverted in the whole World, than the Name of a Christian; shall we then renounce that honourable Title, because so many Thou∣sands
<PB N="16" REF="007840_0023_102DB57E759A84D8"/>
of wicked Men, yea, Antichrists have falsly assume it to themselves? The Man of Sin hath taken upon him to sit in the Temple of God, as God; yet we must not therefore deny, <HI>that God is in this Temple.</HI> If the Synagogue of Satan assumed the Name of the Church of Christ, and hath termed her Oppression and Violence, the Power and Authority thereof; therefore must not the Church of Christ, and its Authority, be exercised, where it truly is according to his Mind? This I prefix to warn all to beware of stumbling at Things which are innocent in themselves; and that we may labour to hold the steady even Path of Truth, without running into either of the Ex∣treams. For that Jesus Christ did appoint Or∣der and Government to be in the Church, is very clear from his plain Words, <HI>Matt.</HI> 18.15, 16, 17, 18. Ver. 15.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Church Or∣der appoint∣ed by Christ, &amp; the Form thereof.</NOTE> <HI>More∣over, if thy Brother shall trespass a∣gainst thee, go tell him his Fault be∣tween thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Brother.</HI> Ver. 16. <HI>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses, every Word may be established.</HI> Ver. 17. <HI>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church: But if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen-Man, and a Publican.</HI> Ver. 18. <HI>Verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</HI> From which Scrip∣ture it doth manifestly and evidently fol∣low,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I.</NOTE> <HI>First,</HI> That Jesus Christ intended there

<NOTE PLACE="marg">II.</NOTE>should be a certain Order and Method in his Church, in the Procedure towards such as trans∣gress. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That he that refuseth to hear two, is become more guilty (as hard∣ned) than in refusing to hear him that first reproved alone. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That refusing to hear the Judgment of the Church, or whole As∣sembly, he doth thereby exclude himself, and shut out himself from being a Member; and is justly judged, by his Brethren, as an Heathen and a Publican.<NOTE PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IV.</NOTE> And <HI>lastly,</HI> that the Church, Gathering or Assembly of God's People, has Power to examine and call to Account such, as appearing to be among them, or owning the same Faith with them, do transgress; and in case of their refu∣sing to hear, or repent, to exclude them from their Fellowship: And that God hath a special Regard to the Judgment and Sense of his People thus orderly proceeding, so as to hold such bound in Heaven, whom they bind on Earth, and such loosed in Heaven, whom they loose on Earth. I am partly confident, that no rational Man will deny, but that these naturally follow from the a∣bove-mentioned Scripture; and if there should be any found so unreasonable as to deny it, I could prove it by necessary and unevitable Con∣sequences; which at present, as taking it for granted, I forbear to do. If it be reckoned so great a Crime to <HI>offend one of the little Ones,</HI> that it were better for him, than so do, that a <HI>Mill-stone were hanged about his Neck, and he were drowned in the Depth of the Sea;</HI> without Question, to offend and gainsay the whole Flock, must be

more criminal; and must draw after it a far deeper <HI>Judgment.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The End of Church-Order.</NOTE> Now if there were no Order nor Government in the Church, what should become of those that transgress? How should they be again restored? Would not this make all Reproving, all Instructing, all Caring for, and Watching over one another, void and null? Why should Christ have desired them to proceed after this Method? Why doth he place so much Weight upon the Judgment of the Church, as to make the refusing of hearing it, to draw so deep a Censure after it; which he will not have to fol∣low the refusing to hear one or two a-part, though the Matter be one and the same? And so, as to the substantial and intrinsick Truth of the Thing, there lies the same Obligation upon the Transgressor to hear that one, as well as all; for that one adviseth him to that which is right and good, as well as the whole; and they do but homologate or confirm that which that one hath already asserted: Yet Jesus Christ, who is the Author of Order, and not of Confusion, will not have a Brother cut off, or reputed a <HI>Publican,</HI> for refusing to hear one or two, but for refusing to hear the Church. And if it be objected, <HI>That the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>and all other false Churches, make use of this Scripture, and cover their Persecution, and Cruelty, and Oppression by it; and thou sayest no more than they say.</HI> I Answer; I suppose no Man will be so unreasonable as to affirm, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> abusing this Scripture, will<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection.</NOTE>

I am not now claiming Right to this Power, as due to us (that is reserved for another Place;) but this, I say, is that which I now aver to be manifest from the Scripture-Testimony, and to be in itself an unquestionable Truth, <HI>That Jesus Christ intended there should be Order and Government in his Church;</HI> which is the Thing at present in Hand to be proved; Which if it be so really true (as it cannot be de∣nied) then I hope it will also necessarily follow, that such, who really and truly are the Church of Christ, have Right to exercise this Order and Government.</P>

positive Conclusion. Sure some behoved to sub∣mit, else they should never have agreed. So those that were the Elders, gave a positive Judgment; and they were bold to say, <HI>That it pleased not only them, but the Holy Ghost.</HI> By all which it doth undeniably appear, that the Apostles, and primitive Saints, practised a Holy Order and Government among themselves: And I hope none will be so bold as to say, they did these Things without the Leadings of the Spirit of God, and his Power and Authority concurring, and going along with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apo∣stles Doctrine concerning Order in the Church.</NOTE> And that these Things were not only singular Practices; but that they held it doctrinally; that is to say, it was Doctrine which they preached; that there ought to be Order and Government in the Church, is mani∣fest from these following Testimonies, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.15, 16, 17.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor. 4.15, 16, 17.</NOTE> (15.) <HI>For though you have Ten Thousand Instructors in Christ; yet have ye not many Fathers: For in Christ Jesus, I have begotten you through the Gospel.</HI> (16.) <HI>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye Follow∣ers of me.</HI> (17.) <HI>For this Cause have I sent unto you</HI> Timotheus, <HI>who is my beloved Son, and faith∣ful in the Lord; who shall bring you into Remem∣brance of my Ways, which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every Church.</HI> Here the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> is very absolute: <HI>First,</HI> In that he desires them to be <HI>Followers</HI> of him. <HI>Secondly,</HI> In that he sends a Teacher, yea, a Minister, and eminent Bishop, or Overseer of the Church, for to put them in Mind of his <HI>Ways,</HI> which be in <HI>Christ,</HI>

<HI>as he taught in every Church.</HI> No doubt there were Apostates, and dissenting Spirits in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> that gave <HI>Paul</HI> occasion thus to write, as he testifies in the Beginning of the Chapter, how he was <HI>judged by some of them;</HI> he shews, how they were <HI>grown high;</HI> Verse 8. <HI>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as Kings without us,</HI> &amp;c.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The primi∣tive Christi∣ans Order practised in the Church.</NOTE> I might at length enlarge, if needful, upon these Passages, any of which is sufficient to prove the Matter in Hands but that what is said may satisfy such as are not wilfully blind and obsti∣nate. For there can be nothing more plain from these Testimonies, than that the <HI>antient Apostles and primitive Chri∣stians practised Order and Govern∣ment in the Church;</HI> that some did appoint and ordain certain Things; condemn and approve certain Practices, as well as Doctrines, by the Spirit of God: That there lay an Obligation in Point of Duty upon others to obey and submit: That this was no En∣croachment nor Imposition upon their Christian Liberty; nor any ways contradictory to their being inwardly and immediately led by the Spirit of God in their Hearts: And lastly, That such, as are in the true Feeling and Sense, will find it their Places to obey, and be one with the Church of Christ in such like Cases: And that it is such as have lost their Sense and Feeling of the Life of the Body, that dissent, and are disobedient, under the false Pretence of Liberty. So that thus it is sufficiently proved what I undertook in this Place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason III.</NOTE><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I judge there will need no great Arguments to prove the People of God may, and do well to exercise the like Government upon the very like Occasion.

We find (to our great Grief) that some walk disorderly; and some are puffed up, and strive to sow Di∣vision, labouring to stumble the Weak, and to cause Offences in the Church of Christ: What then is more suitable, and more Christian, than to follow the Foot-steps of the Flock, and to labour and travel for the Good of the Church, and for the removing all that is hurtful; even as the Holy Apostles, who walked with Jesus, did before us? If there be such that walk disor∣derly now, must not they be admonished, re∣buked and withdrawn from, as well as of old? Or is such to be the Condition of the Church in these latter Times, that all Iniquity must go unreproved? Must it be Heresy, or Oppression, to watch over one another in Love? To take Care for the Poor? To see that there be no corrupt, no defiled Members of the Body, and carefully and christianly deal with them, for re∣storing them, if possible; and for withdrawing from them; if incurable? I am perswaded, that there are none that look upon the Commands of Christ and his Apostles, the Practice and Experience of the primitive Church and Saints, as a sufficient

as a Temptation Man is incident to? We confess, indeed, we are against such as from the bare Let∣ter of the Scripture (though if it were season∣able now to debate it, we find but few to deal with, whose Practices are so exactly squared) seek to uphold <HI>Customs, Forms</HI> or <HI>Shadows,</HI> when the Use, for which they were appointed, is removed, or the Substance itself known and witnessed; as we have sufficiently elsewhere answered our Op∣posers in the Case of <HI>Water-baptism,</HI> and <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> &amp;c. So that the <HI>Objection,</HI> as to that, doth not hold; and the Difference is very wide, in respect of such Things: The very Nature and Substance of which can never be dispensed with by the People of God, so long as they are in this World; yea, without which they could not be his <HI>People.</HI> For the Doctrines, and fundamental Principles of the Christian Faith, we own and be∣lieve originally and principally, because they are the <HI>Truths</HI> of God; whereunto the Spirit of God in our Hearts hath constrained our Under∣standings to obey and submit. In the second Place, we are greatly confirmed, strengthened and comforted in the <HI>joint Testimony</HI> of our Brethren, the Apostles and Dis∣ciples of Christ, who by the Revela∣tion of the same Spirit in the Days of old believed, and have lest upon Record the same Truths; so we <HI>hav∣ing the same Spirit of Faith,</HI> accord∣ing as it is written, <HI>I believed, and therefore have I spoken;</HI> we also believe, and there∣fore we speak.

Things, have thereby in the Mercy of God re∣ceived Occasion to have them revealed in the <HI>Life:</HI> For we freely acknowledge (though often calumniated to the contrary) that <HI>whatsoever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning; that we through Patience and Com∣fort of the Scriptures may have Hope.</HI> So then I hope, if the Spirit of God lead me now unto that which is good, profitable, yea, and <HI>absolutely need∣ful,</HI> in order to the keeping my Conscience clear and void of Offence towards God and Man, none will be so unreasonable as to say, I ought not to do it, <HI>because it is according to the Scriptures.</HI> Nor do I think it will <HI>savour ill</HI> among any seri∣ous, solid Christians, for me to be the more con∣firmed and perswaded that I am led to this Thing by the Spirit, that I find it in myself <HI>good</HI> and <HI>useful;</HI> and that upon the like Occasions Christ <HI>commanded</HI> it, and the Apostles and primitive Christians practised and recommended it.</P>
<P>Now, seeing it is so that we can boldly say, with a good Conscience in the Sight of God, that the same Spirit, which leads us to believe the Doctrines and Principles of the Truth, and to hold and maintain them again, after the Apo∣stacy, in their primitive and antient Purity, as they were delivered by the Apostles of Christ in the Holy Scriptures; I say, that the same Spi∣rit doth now lead us into the like Holy Order and Government to be exercised among us, as it was among them, being now the like Occasion and Opportunity ministred to us; therefore, what can any christianly or rationally object against it?

Seeing as it is needful to use all Diligence to convince and perswade People of the Truth, and bring them to the Belief of it (which yet we cannot do, but as Truth moves and draws in their Hearts) it is also no less needful, when a People is gathered, to keep and preserve them in Unity and Love, as becomes the Church of Christ; and to be careful, as faith the Apostle, <HI>That all Things be done decently, and in order;</HI> and that all that is wrong be removed, according to the Method of the Gospel; and the Good cherished and en∣couraged.

<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>Of the</HI> Order <HI>and</HI> Government <HI>which we plead for.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT will be needful then, before I proceed to describe the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> to consider what is, or may be properly understood by the <HI>Church:</HI> For some (as I touch∣ed before) seem to be offended, or at least afraid of the very Word; because, <HI>The Power of the Church, the Order of the Church, the Judgment of the Church,</HI> and such like Pretences, have been the great Weapons wherewith Antichrist and the apostate Christians have been these many Genera∣tions persecuting the Woman, and warring against the Man-child. And, indeed, great Disputes have been among the <HI>learned Rabbies</HI> in the Apostacy concerning this <HI>Church</HI> what it is, or what may be so accounted; which I find not my Place at present to dive much in, but shall only give the true Sense of it, according to Truth, and the Scriptures plain Testimony.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Word <HI>CHURCH</HI> signifies pro∣perly.</NOTE> The Word <HI>CHURCH</HI> in itself, and as used in the Scriptures, is no other but a <HI>Gathering, Company,</HI> or <HI>Assembly of certain People, called or gathered together:</HI> For so the <HI>Greek</HI> Word signifies (which is that the Trauslators render <HI>Church</HI>) which Word is derived from the Verb <HI>Evoco, I call out of,</HI> from the Root <HI>Voco, I call.</HI> Now though the <HI>English</HI> Word <HI>Church</HI> be only taken in such a Sense, as People are <HI>gathered together upon a religious Account;</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="007840_0042_102DB5DA6BCC20B0"/>
yet the <HI>Greek</HI> Word, that is so rendered, is taken in general for every <HI>Gathering,</HI> or <HI>Meeting together of People:</HI> And therefore where it is said, <HI>The Town Clerk of the</HI> Ephesians <HI>dismissed the Tumult, that was gathered there together,</HI> the same <HI>Greek</HI> Word is used, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.41. <HI>he dismissed the Assembly</HI> (or the <HI>Church.</HI>)<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>dimisit Con∣cionem.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What a reli∣gious Church is.</NOTE> A <HI>Church</HI> then, in the Scripture-Phrase, is no other than a meeting or gathering of certain People, which (if it be taken in a religious Sense, as most commonly it is) are gathered together in the Belief of the same Principles, Doctrines and Points of Faith, whereby as a Body they become distinguished from others, and have a certain Relation among themselves; and a con∣junct Interest to the maintaining and propagating these Principles they judge to be right: And therefore have a certain Care and Oversight over one another, to prevent and remove all Occasions that may tend to break this their conjunct In∣terest, hinder the Propagation of it, or bring In∣famy, Contempt, or Contumely upon it; or give such as on the other Hand are, or may be banded together to undo them, just Occasion against them, to decry and defame them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How to di∣stinguish the true Church from the false.</NOTE> Now the Way to distinguish that <HI>Church, Gathering,</HI> or <HI>Assembly</HI> of People, whereof Christ truly is the Head, from such as falsly pretend thereto, is by considering the Principles and Grounds upon which they are gathered together, the Nature of that Hierarchy and Order they have among themselves, the Way and Method
<PB N="36" REF="007840_0043_102DB5990E56E9E8"/>
they take to uphold it, and the Bottom upon which it standeth; which will greatly contribute to clear all Mistakes.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as <HI>Sanctification</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> is the great and chief End among true Christians, which moves them to gather together; therefore the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> defines the Church in his Salutation to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.2. <HI>Unto the Church of God which is at</HI> Corinth, <HI>them that are sancti∣fied in Christ Jesus, called to be Saints.</HI> So the Church is such as are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be Saints.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church's Care over its Members, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> The Power and Authority, Or∣der and Government we speak of, is such, as a <HI>Church Meeting, Ga∣thering</HI> or <HI>Assembly</HI> claims towards those that have, or do declare themselves Mem∣bers, who own, believe and profess the same Doc∣trines and Principles of Faith with us, and go under the same Distinction and Denomination; whose Escapes, Faults and Errors, may by our Ad∣versaries justly be imputed to us, if not season∣ably and christianly reproved, reclaimed or con∣demned. For we are not so foolish, as to con∣cern ourselves with those who are not of us; far less, who stand in Opposition to us, so as to reprove, instruct, or reclaim them, as Fellow-Mem∣bers or Brethren: Yet, with a Respect to remove the general Reproach from the Christian Name, with a tender Regard to the Good of their im∣mortal Souls, for the Zeal we owe to God's Glo∣ry, and for the Exaltation and Propagation of his everlasting Truth and Gospel in the Earth, we have not been wanting, with the Hazard of
<PB N="37" REF="007840_0044_102DB5DCDC643FE0"/>
our Lives, to seek the scattered Ones, holding forth the living and sure Foundation, and invit∣ing and perswading all to obey the Gospel of Christ, and to take Notice of his Reproofs, as he makes himself manifest in and by his Light in their Hearts. So our Care and Travel is, and hath been towards those that are without, that we may bring them into the Fellowship of the Saints in Light; and towards those that are brought in, that they may not be led out again, or drawn aside, either to the Left-hand, or the Right, by the Workings and Temptations of the Enemy.</P>
<P>These Things being thus cleared and opened, we do positively affirm, That we being <HI>a People gathered together by the Power of God</HI> (which most, if not all of those, that arising among ourselves do oppose us herein, have acknowledged) into the Belief of certain Principles and Doctrines, and also certain Practices and Performances, by which we are come to be separated and distin∣guished from others, so as to meet apart, and also to suffer deeply for our joint Testimony; there are, and must of Necessity be, as in the ga∣thering of us, so in the preserving of us while gathered, Diversities of Gifts and Operations for the edi∣fying of the whole Body. Hence, saith the Apostle, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>Let the Elders, that rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour, especially they who labour in the Word and Doc∣trine:</HI> And this we suppose neither to be <HI>Popish,</HI> nor Anti-christian, let our Opposers say it, as oft as they can, without reckoning the Apostles such.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diversities of Gifts in the Church.</NOTE></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meetings a∣bout Business.</NOTE> <HI>Secondly,</HI> Forasmuch as all are not called in the same Station, some rich, some poor; some Servants, some Masters, some married, some unmarried; some Widows, and some Orphans, and so forth; it is not only convenient, but ab∣solutely needful, that there be cer∣tain Meetings at certain Places and Times, as may best suit the Conve∣niencies of such, who may be most particularly concerned, in them; where both those that are to take Care may assemble, and those who may need this Care, may come and make known their Necessities, and receive Help, whether by Counsel or Supply, according to their respective Needs. This doth not at all contradict the Principle of being led inwardly and immediately by the Spirit; else how came the Apostle in that Day of the powerful pour∣ing forth of the Spirit of God, to set apart Men for this Purpose? Sure, this was not to lead them from their inward Guide; yea, on the contrary, it is expresly said, <HI>Look ye out among you seven Men of honest Report, full of the Holy Ghost, and Wisdom, whom we may appoint over this Business.</HI> Sure, they were not to undertake a Business, being full of the Holy Ghost, which might import a Contradiction to their being led by it: So we see it is both fit and suitable to the Apostles Doctrine, to have <HI>Meetings about Business.</HI> Now if any should be so whimsical of conceited, as to scruple their being at set Places and Times, though these be nothing relative to the essential Parts, but only Circumstances, re∣lating <NOTE PLACE="marg">—established by the Apo∣stle.</NOTE>

to the Conveniency of our Persons (which we must have regard to, so long as we are cloth∣ed with Flesh and Blood: And such Notionists, as are against this godly Care, work far more in their vain Imaginations, than they reduce to Practice; being like unto such, of whom the Apostle <HI>James</HI> testified, who content themselves, with saying to the Naked, <HI>be cloathed; and to the Hungry, be fed;</HI> while they offer not, in the least, to minister to them those Things which are needful for cloathing and feeding of them.) Yet shall we not scruple to make it appear, that it is not without very good Ground that we both appoint Places and Times. And first, as to the <HI>Place,</HI> I say as before, it is with our Bodies we must meet, as well as with our Spirits; and so, of Necessity, we must convey our Bodies unto one Place, that we may speak and act in those Things we meet for: And that must be in some certain Place, where all must know where to find it; having herein a Regard to the Conveniencies and Occasions of such as meet. Were it fit, that those of the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> should go do their Business at <HI>An∣tioch,</HI> or the Church of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at <HI>Rome?</HI> Nay surely, God hath not given us our Reason to no Purpose; but that we should make use of it for his Glory, and the Good of our Bre∣thren; yet always in Subjection to his Power and Spirit. And therefore we have Respect to these Things in the appointing of our Meetings and do it not without a Regard to the Lord, but in a Sense of his Fear. And so the like as to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Convenient Places to meet in—</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">—And con∣venient set Times ap∣pointed.</NOTE> <HI>Times,</HI> which is no contradicting of the inward Leading of the Spirit. Else how came the Apostle to appoint a Time to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> in their Contri∣butions, desiring them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.2. <HI>To lay by them in Store Upon the first Day of the Week; yea,</HI> saith he not, <HI>that he gave the same Order to the Church of</HI> Galatia. I know not how any in Reason can quarrel about <HI>set Times</HI> for outward Business, it being done in a Subjection to God's Will, as all Things ought to be; or else how can such as so do, but quar∣rel with the Apostle for this Imposition (at that rate) upon the Churches of <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Galatia?</HI> We appoint no set Times for the Performance of the Worship of God, so as to appoint Men to preach and pray at such and such set Times; though we appoint Times to <HI>meet together in the Name of the Lord,</HI> that we may feel his Pre∣sence, and he may move in and through whom he pleaseth, without Limitation. Which Prac∣tice of <HI>Meeting together,</HI> we are greatly encouraged to by the Pro∣mise of Christ, and our own blessed Experience; and also we are severe∣ly prohibited to lay it aside by the Holy Apostle; and also, on the other Hand, by the sad Experience of such as by Negligence or Prejudice forsake the Assemblies of God's People; upon many of which is already fulfilled, and upon others daily fulfilling the Judgments threatened upon such Transgressors: Read <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. from Verse 23, to the End, where that Duty is so seriously exhorted to, and the Contempt of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for the Continu∣ance of our said Practices.</NOTE>
<PB N="41" REF="007840_0048_102DB5E18303D1F0"/>
it reckoned a wilful Sin, almost (if not altoge∣ther) unpardonable; yea, a <HI>treading under Foot the Son of God, and a doing Despight to the Spirit of Grace;</HI> which is fulfilled in our Day, and proves the lamentable Fruits of such as have so back slidden among us. And therefore having so much good and real Ground, for what we do herein, together with the Approbation and En∣couragement of Christ, and his Apostles, both by Command and Practice, we can (as that both the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Foundation and Cap-stone required) faithfully affirm in good Conscience, <HI>That God hath led us by his Spirit, both to appoint Places and Times, where we may see the Faces one of another; and to take Care one for another, pro∣voking one another to Love and good Works.</HI> And our Faith and Confidence herein cannot be stag∣gered by a meer Denial in our Opposers, which no Man of Conscience and Reason will say it ought; seeing the Thing itself hath such a so∣lid and real Cause and Foundation, so good and suitable a Pattern and Example, and that it is constantly confirmed to us, both by the Testimony of God's Spirit in our Hearts, and by the good Fruits and Effects which we daily reap thereby, as a Seal and Confirmation that God is well pleased therewith, and approveth us in it.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occasion of those Meetings a∣bout Busi∣ness.</NOTE> I Shall begin with that, which gave the first Rise for this <HI>Or∣der</HI> among the Apostles; and I do verily believe, might have been a∣mong the first Occasions that gave the like among us, and that is, <HI>The Care of the Poor; of Widows and Orphans.

For this then, as one main End, do we meet together, that Enquiry may be made, if there be any Poor of the Hou∣shold of Faith that need, that they may be sup∣plied; that the Widows may be taken Care of; that the Orphans and Fatherless may be bred up and educated. Who will be so Unchristian, as to reprove this good <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> and to say it is needless? But if any will thus object, <HI>May not the Spirit lead every one of you to give to them that need? What needs meeting about it, and such Formalities?</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P><PB N="43" REF="007840_0050_102DB5E30EFEAF20"/>
I answer, The Spirit of God leads us so to do; what can they say to the contrary? Nor is this a Practice any ways inconsistent with being in∣wardly and immediately led by the Spirit; for the Spirit of God doth now, as well as in the Days of old, lead his People into those Things which are orderly, and of a good Report; for he is the God of Order, and not of Confusion: And there∣fore the holy Apostles judged it no Inconsistency with their being led by the Spirit, to appoint <HI>Men full of the Holy Ghost, and of Wisdom, over the Business of the Poor.</HI> Now, if to be <HI>full of the Holy Ghost</HI> be a Qualification needful for this Employment; surely the Nature of their Employment was not to render this so needful a Qualification useless and ineffectual, as if they were not to be led by it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Exam∣ple of the Apostles.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover we see, though they were at that Time all filled with the Spirit, yet there was something wanting before this good Order was established. <HI>There was a Murmuring, that some Widows were neglected in the daily Ministration;</HI> and we must not suppose the Apostles went about to remedy this Evil, that was creeping into the Church, without the Counsel of God by his Spi∣rit, or that this Remedy they were led to, was stepping into Apostacy; neither can it be so said of us, we proceeding upon the like Occasion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contribu∣tions for the Poor.</NOTE> If then it be thus needful and suitable to the Gospel, to relieve the Necessities of the Poor, that as there was <HI>no Beggar to be among</HI> Israel <HI>of old,</HI> so far less now; must there not
<PB N="44" REF="007840_0051_102DB5A2CDFDA658"/>
be Meetings to appoint Contribution, in order to the performing these Things? Which is no other, but the giving of a general Intimation what the Needs are, that every one, as God moves their Hearts, and hath prospered them (without Imposition, Force or Limitation) may give towards these needful Uses. In which Case these Murmurers at our good Order in such Matters, may well think strange at the Apostle: How pressingly! how earnestly doth he reiterate his Desires and Provocations, so to speak, in this Respect to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.2. and the eighth and ninth Chapters of the second Epistle throughout!</P>
<P>Now, though he testifies to them elsewhere, That <HI>they are the Temples of the Holy Ghost, and that the Spirit of God dwells in them;</HI> yet ceaseth be not to intreat and exhort, yea, and to give them certain Orders in this Matter.</P>
<P>Besides all these Reasons, which are sufficient to convince any unprejudicate Man, the secret Approbation of God's Spirit accompanying us in this Thing, together with the Fruits and Effects of it; which Hundreds can witness to, whose Needs have been supplied, and themselves helped through divers Difficulties; and the Testimonies of some already, and of many more Orphans, and Fatherless Children, who have found no Want, neither of Father nor Mother, or other Rela∣tions, through the tender Love and Care of God's People, in putting them to Trades and Employments, and giving them all needful Education: Which will make it appear, e're <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fatherless Children put Apprentices.</NOTE>

Or if thro' the Workings and Temptations of him, whose Work is to beset the Faithful, and People of the Lord, and to en∣gender (so far as he can) Strife and Division among them, any should step aside, as to offer to wrong or prejudice his Neighbour; we do bold∣ly aver, as a People gathered together by the Lord unto the same Faith, and distinguished from all others by our Joint-Testimony and Sufferings, that we have Power and Authority to decide and re∣move these Things among ourselves, without go∣ing to others to seek Redress. And this in it∣self hath so much Reason, that I cannot tell if any, that are not wholly prejudicate or obstinate, can blame it. For if we be of one Mind concern∣ing Faith and Religion, and that it be our Joint-Interest to bring all others unto the same Truth with us, as supposing them to be wrong, what Confidence can we have to think of re∣claiming them, if the Truth we profess have

not Efficacy, as to reconcile us among ourselves in the Matters of this World: If we be forced to go out to others for Equity and Justice, be∣cause we cannot find it among ourselves, how can we expect to invite them to come among us, when such Virtues, as which still accompany the Truth, are necessarily supposed to be wanting? Should we affirm otherwise, it were to destroy the Truth and Faith we have been, and are, in the Lord's Hand, building up: And indeed the Spirit and Practice of such as oppose us herein, hath no less Tendency.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection.</NOTE> Moreover, besides the enforcing and intrin∣sick Reason of this Thing, we have the Concur∣rence, Approbation and Comfort of the Apostle's Testimony, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. <HI>Dare any of you, having a Matter against another, go to Law before the Unjust, and not before the Saints?</HI> If it be objected, <HI>Do you reckon all un∣just that are not of you?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Believers not to go to Law before the Unjust, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> I answer, Though the Apostle useth this Expression, I am per∣swaded he did not reckon all others unjust, that had not received then the Christian-Faith. There were, no doubt, moral and just Men among the <HI>Heathen;</HI> and therefore the same <HI>Paul</HI> commends the Nobility of <HI>Festus.</HI> He reckons them there <HI>Unjust</HI> in respect of the Saints, or comparatively with them, as such as are not come to the <HI>just Principle of God in them∣selves,</HI> to obey it, and follow it: And therefore though he accounts them, who are least esteemed in the Church, capable to decide such Matters;
<PB N="47" REF="007840_0054_102DB5E9C7D22AB0"/>
yet he supposeth it safer to submit to their Judg∣ment in such Cases, though it were by <HI>taking Wrong,</HI> or <HI>suffering Wrong,</HI> than to go before o∣thers, to the greater Reproach of the Truth. We hope, though many Occasions of this kind have fallen in among us, since we have been a People, none have had just Occasion to decline our Judg∣ment. And though some should suppose them∣selves to be wronged; yet if they should bring their Matter before others, we might say, as the Apostle saith in the fore-mentioned Chapter, Ver. 7. <HI>This were thereby a Fault in them,</HI> and would evidence a greater Care of some outward Concern, than of the Honour and Interest of Truth; and therefore such as have a tender Regard that way, would rather suffer what, to their Apprehen∣sions, may seem wrong. For in Matters wherein two Parties are opposite in the Case of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum.</HI> it is somewhat hard to please both; except where the Power of Truth, and the righte∣ous Judgment thereof reaching to that of God in the Conscience, hath brought to a true Acknowledgment him that hath been mista∣ken, or in the Wrong; which hath frequently fallen out among us, to the often refreshing and confirming our Souls in the certain Belief, that Christ was fulfilling his Promises among us, <HI>In restoring Judges, as at the first, and Counsellors, as in the Beginning.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Case of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum.</HI></NOTE></P>

his Brethren, and to go before the Unbelievers (for though I reckon them not such Unbelievers as the <HI>Heathen</HI> of old, because they profess a Faith in God and Christ; yet I may safely say, they are Unbelievers as to these Principles and Doctrines, which we know are the Truth of God; and in that Sense must be Unbelievers as to him, that so appealeth to them from his Brethren.) I say, such as so do, first commit a certain Hurt, and Evil, in staining the Honour and Reputation, of the Truth they profess, which ought to be dearer to us than our Lives. And even in that outward Matter, for which they thus do, they run a Hazard, not knowing whether Things shall carry, as they expect: If they lose, they have a double Prejudice; if they gain, it is a too dear Rate, even with the Hurt of <HI>Truth's</HI> Reputation, which their outward Advantage can∣not make up.

For as Truth and Righteousness prevails in the Earth, by our faithful witnessing and keeping to it, the Nations shall come to be eased and disburdened of that deceitful Tribe of <HI>Lawyers</HI> (as well as <HI>Priests</HI>) who by their many Tricks and endless Intricacies, have rendred Justice, in their Method, burden∣some to honest Men, and seek not so much to put an End, as to foment Controversies and Contentions, that they themselves may be still fed and upheld, and their Trade kept up.

We desire not to propagate Hurt, and defile Peoples Minds, with telling them such Things as tend not to edify; yet do we not so cover over, or smooth over any Wickedness, as not to deal roundly with the Persons guilty, and causing them to take away the Scandal in their Acknowledgment before all, to whole Knowledge in hath come: Yet judge we not ourselves obliged to <HI>tell that in</HI> Gath, <HI>or publish that in the Streets of</HI> Askelon, <HI>which make the Daughters of the Uncircumcised rejoice;</HI> or strengthen <HI>Atheists</HI> and <HI>Ranters</HI> in their Obdurateness, who feed more upon the Failings of the Saints, than to imitate their true Repentance.

<P>But before I proceed upon these, I affirm, and that according to Truth, that as the Church and Assembly of God's People may, and hath Power to decide by the Spirit of God in Matters fun∣damental and weighty (without which no De∣cision nor Decree in whatever Matters is avail∣able) so the same Church and Assembly also, in other Matters of less Moment, as to themselves (yet being needful and expedient with a Respect to the <HI>Cir∣cumstance</HI> of Time, Place and other Things that may fall in) may and hath Power by the same Spirit, and not otherwise, being acted, moved and assisted, and led by it thereto, to pronouce a positive Judg∣ment: Which, no Doubt, will be found obliga∣tory upon all such, who have a Sense and Feeling of the Mind of the Spirit, though rejected by such as are not watchful, and so are out of the Feeling and Unity of the Life.

For there is no greater Property of the Church of Christ, than pure Unity in the Spirit; that is, a consenting and oneness in Judgment, and Practices in Mat∣ters of Faith and Worship (which yet admits of different Measures, Growths and Motions, but never, contrary and contradictory Ones; and in these Diversities of Operations, yet still, by the same Spirit, the true liberty is exercised, as shall be declared hereafter:) Therefore prayeth Christ, <HI>That they all may be One, as he and the Father is One.</HI> To which Purpose also let these following Scriptures be examined:</P>

<P>1 Cor. 1.10. <HI>Now I beseech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no Divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same Mind, and in the same Judgment.</HI></P>

<P>And yet more remarkable is that of the. Apo∣stle <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> Chap. 3. Verse 15. <HI>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in any Thing ye be otherwise mind∣ed, God shall reveal even this unto you.</HI></P>

<P>Now, if it be an Evil to do any Thing out of Strife; then such Things that are seen so to be done, are they not to be avoided and forsaken?

<P>If any then should quarrel with his Brother for exercising that which belongeth to the Office of the Body Christ hath called him to, and would force him to exercise the same Office he doth, though he be not called to it; here is a Breach of Christian Liberty, and an imposing upon it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Breach of Liberty begets Jarrs and Schisms.</NOTE> Now all Schisms and Jarrs fall out in this two-fold Respect: Either when any Person or Persons assume another, or an higher Place in the Body, than God will have them to be in, and so exercise an Office; or go about to perform that, which they ought not to do; or when, as any truly exercising in their Place, which God hath given them, others rise up and judge them, and would draw them from it; both of which Cases have been, and may be supposed to fall out in the Church of Christ.

But besides the Forbearance of this Nature, which is most ordinary and universal (and for the Exercise whereof there is, and will still be a Need, so long as there is any Gathering or Church of Christ upon the Earth) there is a certain Liberty and Forbearance also, that is more particular, and has a Relation to the Circumstance of Times and Places, which will not hold universally; whereof we have the Example of the primitive Church, testified by the Scriptures in two or three Particulars. The first was, <HI>In suffering Circum∣cision to the</HI> Jews <HI>for a Time,</HI> and not only so, but also divers others of the legal and ceremo∣nial Purifications and Customs, as may appear, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.

So that we say, and that with a very good Ground, that it is no way inconsistent with this sound and unerring Principle to affirm, That the Judgment of a certain Person or Persons in certain Cases is infallible, or for a certain Person or Persons to give a positive Judgment, and pronounce it as ob∣ligatory upon others, because the Foundation and Ground thereof is, not because they are infallible, but because in these Things, and at that Time they were led by the infallible Spirit.

<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assert. 1.</NOTE> <HI>First,</HI> That there never will, nor can be wanting, in Case of Contro∣versy, the Spirit of God, to give Judgment through some or other in the Church of Christ, so long as any Assembly can properly, or in any tolerable Supposition be so termed.</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assert. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Secondly,</HI> That God hath ordinarily, in the communicating of his Will under his Gospel, employed such whom he had made use of in gathering of his Church, and in feeding and watching over them; though not excluding others.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assert. 1. Proved.</NOTE> For the <HI>First,</HI> to those that believe the Scripture, there will need no other Probation than that of <HI>Matt.</HI> 28.20. <HI>And lo, I am with you al∣way, even unto the End of the World.</HI> And Verse 18. <HI>And the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Infalli∣ble Spirit the Gates of Hell cannot pre∣vail against.</NOTE> Now if the Church of Christ were so destitute of the Spirit of God, that in Case of Difference there were not any found that, by the infallible Spirit, could give a certain Judg∣ment; would not then the Gates

of Hell prevail against it? For where Strife and Division is, and no effectual Way to put an End to it, there not only the Gates, but the Courts and inner Chambers of Darkness prevail; for where Envy and Strife is, there is Confusion, and every Evil Work.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The erring Church or People—</NOTE> But that there may be here no Ground of Mi∣stake or Supposition, that we were annexing <HI>In∣fallibility</HI> to certain Persons, or limiting the Church to such; I understand not by the Church, every particular Gathering or Assembly, circumscribed to any particular Country or City: For I will not refuse but divers of them, both apart and to∣gether, if not established in God's Power, may err. Nor yet do I lay the absolute Stress upon a general Assembly of Persons, as such, pick∣ed and chosen out of every one of those particular Churches; as if what the Gene∣rality or Plurality of those conclude upon, were necessarily to be supposed to be the infallible Judg∣ment of Truth: Though to such an Assembly of Persons truly stated (as they ought) in God's Power, he hath heretofore revealed his Will in such Cases; and yet may, as the most probable Way (which shall be spoken of hereafter:) Yet such, as a meer Assembly, is not conclusive, nor yet do I understand by the Church, every Ga∣thering or Assembly of People, who may hold sound and true Principles, or have a Form of Truth; for some may lose the Life and Power of Godli∣ness, who notwithstanding may re∣tain the Form or Notions of Things, but yet are to be <HI>turned away from,</HI> because in <NOTE PLACE="marg">—Having the Form of Truth.</NOTE>
<PB N="89" REF="007840_0096_102DB650B03B0FA8"/>
so far (as I observed before) as Sanctification, to wit, those that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, make the Church, and give the right Definition to it: Where that is wholly wanting, the Church of Christ ceaseth to be; and there remains nothing but a Shadow without Substance. Such Assem∣blies then are like the dead Body, when the Soul is departed, which is no more sit to be conversed with; because it corrupts, and proves noisome to the Living. But by the Church of Christ, I un∣derstand all those that truly and really have re∣ceived and hold the Truth, as it is in Jesus, and are in Measure sanctified, or sanctifying in and by the Power and Virtue thereof work∣ing in their inward Parts; and this may be made up of divers distinct <HI>Gatherings</HI> or Churches in several Countries or Nations: I say, so long as these, or any of them do retain that, which justly entitles them the Church or Churches of Christ (which they may be truly called) though there may fall out some Differences, Divisions or Schisms among them; as we may see there was no small Dis∣sention in the Church of <HI>Autioch,</HI> and yet it ceased not to be a Church, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.2. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Church.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The certain Judgment of Truth is ne∣ver wanting in the Church of Christ.</NOTE> <HI>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my Bre∣thren, that there are Contentions among you;</HI> and yet, Verse 2. he entitles them the Church of God, <HI>them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus:</HI> So long, I say, as they truly retain this Title of the Church of Christ, as being really such, there will never be wanting the certain Judgment of Truth. For which,
<PB N="90" REF="007840_0097_102DB65317BF3D28"/>
besides the positive Promise of Christ before-men∣tioned (which is not without Blasphemy to be called in Question, or doubted of) I shall add these Reasons. That seeing the Church of Christ is his Body, of which he is the Head, it were to make Christ negligent of his Body, who stiles himself the good Shepherd, and hath said, <HI>He will never leave nor forsake his own;</HI> or else (which is worse) it will infer a Possibility of <HI>Error,</HI> or <HI>Mistake</HI> in Christ, in whom, as the Head, are the Eyes of the Body, by which it is to be ruled in all Things. <HI>Next,</HI> We never find in alt the Scrip∣ture since the Gospel, that ever this was wanting; but that God still gave infallible Judgment by his Spirit in some of the Respects above-mentioned. If the Transactions and Controversies of the after Centuries be alledged, I will boldly affirm and prove, That there was never a true Judgment wanting, so long as the Nature and <HI>Essence</HI> of the true Church was retained: If any will needs affirm otherwise, let them shew me where, and I shall answer it. Though I deny not (that after the Mystery of <HI>Iniquity</HI> did begin to work, or had so wrought, first by intermixing, and afterward by altogether forsaking the Nature of Truth, re∣taining only the bare Name of the Church) but that there might be some scattered Ones, here and there one in a Nation, and now and then one in an Age, who, by the Power and Virtue of the Spirit of Life working in them, might be truly sanctified; yet these were but as Witnesses in Sackcloth, no ways sufficient to give these As∣semblies, in which they were engrossed, the Ap∣pellation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Witnesses in Sackcloth.</NOTE>
<PB N="91" REF="007840_0098_102DB6555EA35A70"/>
of the Church of Christ, coming no more under Observation by the Generality, nor having, as to them, any more Influence than some little or scarcely discernable Sparks of Fire in many great Heaps and Mountains of Ashes. And thus much to prove, that where there is any Ga∣thering or Assembly, which truly and properly may be called the Church of Christ, the <HI>infalli∣ble Judgment</HI> will never be wanting in Matters of Controversy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assertion 2 proved.</NOTE> Secondly, <HI>That ordinarily God hath, in the Communicating of his Will un∣der his Gospel, employed such whom he had made use of in gathering of his Church, and in feeding and watching over them, though not ex∣cluding others.</HI> For, as in a natural Body (to which the Church of Christ is compared) the more sub∣stantial and powerful Members do work most effectual; and their Help is most necessary to sup∣ply any Defect or Trouble in the Body: So also, if there be Diversities of Gifts in the Church (as is above proved) and some have a greater Measure, and some a lesser, those that have the greater are more capable to do Good, and to help the Body in its Need, than others that are weaker and less powerful. Since there are Strong and Weak, Babes and young Men, <HI>who have over∣come the evil One, and in whom the Word of God abid∣eth,</HI> such are more able, when the Enemy besets, to resist (having already overcome) than others who are but yet wrestling, and not Conquerors. Now, every Contro∣versy and Dissention in the Church Comes from the Besetments of the Enemy; yet if any of these strong <NOTE PLACE="marg">From the Be∣setments of the Enemy Dissentions arise.</NOTE>
<PB N="92" REF="007840_0099_102DB658525D9960"/>
or young Men, or powerful Members, go from their Station, it is not denied but that they are as weak as any; and it is pre-supposing their Faithfulness in their I lace that I thus affirm, and no otherwise. Nor vet do I limit the Lord to this Method: <HI>For in him are all the Treasures both of our Wisdom and Strength;</HI> and the weakest in his Hand are as strong as the strongest, who may now, as well as heretofore, kill a <HI>Goliah</HI> by the Hand of little <HI>David;</HI> yet we see the Lord doth ordinarily make use of the Strong to sup∣port the Weak: And indeed, when such as may be termed weak are so made use of, it alters the Nature of their Place, and constitutes them in a higher and more eminent Degree. For though it was little <HI>David,</HI> it was also he that was to be King of <HI>Israel.</HI> Though the Apostles were mean Men among the <HI>Jews,</HI> yet they were such as were to be the Apostles of the Lord of Glory; Instruments to gather the lost Sheep of the House of <HI>Israel,</HI> and to proclaim the acceptable Day of the Lord. And though <HI>Paul</HI> was once accounted the <HI>least of all the Saints, a Child born out of due Time;</HI> yet was he him who was to be the greatest Apostle of the <HI>Gentilès.</HI></P>
<P>Now then, let us consider whom the Lord makes use of in the Affairs of the primitive Church, and through whom he gave forth his infallible Judg∣ment. Did he not begin first by <HI>Peter?</HI> He was the first that spake in the first Meeting they had, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. and who first stood up after the pouring forth of the Spirit; and who first appeared be∣fore the Council of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and spake in Behalf of the Gospel of Christ: Though I am far from
<PB N="93" REF="007840_0100_102DB65AACDD2738"/>
calling him (as some do) the Prince of the Apo∣stles; yet I may safely say, he was one of the most <HI>antient</HI> and <HI>eminent,</HI> and to whom Christ, in a Manner somewhat more than ordinary, had recommended the Feeding of his Flock. We see also he was first made use of in preaching to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and what Weight his and <HI>James's</HI> Words had in the Contest about Circumcision towards the bringing the Matter to a Conclu∣sion, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. Yet that we may see Infallibility was not inseparably annexed to him, he was found blameable in a certain Matter, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.11. not∣withstanding his Sentence was positively received in many Particulars.</P>
<P>So also the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> argues from his ga∣thering of the Churches of <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Galatia,</HI> that they ought to be Followers of him, and positively concludes in divers Things. And up∣on this Supposition, exhorts the Churches (both he and <HI>Peter</HI>) in many Passages heretofore men∣tioned (which I will not, to avoid Repetition, again rehearse) <HI>to obey the Elders that watch for them; to hold such in Reputation, and to submit themselves to them that have addicted themselves to the Ministry of the Saints,</HI> Cor. 16.15, 16.</P>
<P>Also, we see how the Lord makes use of <HI>John,</HI> his beloved Disciple, to inform and reprove the <HI>Seven Churches of Asia;</HI> and no Doubt <HI>John</HI> (the rest, by the usual Computation, being at that time all removed) was then the most noted and fa∣mous Elder alive: And, indeed, I mind not where, under the Gospel, Christ hath used any other Method; but that he always, in revealing his Will, hath made use of such as he himself had be∣fore
<PB N="94" REF="007840_0101_102DB65CF23DF040"/>
appointed Elders and Officers in his Church; though it be far from us to limit the Lord, so as to exclude any from this Privilege; nor yet, on the other Hand, will the Possibility hereof be a sufficient Warrant to allow every obscure Mem∣ber to stand up and offer to rule, judge, and condemn the whole Body; nor yet is it without Cause that such an One's Message is jealoused and called in Question, unless it have very great Evidence, and be bottomed upon some very weighty and solid Cause and Foundation. And God doth so furnish those whom he raises up, in a singular Manner, of which (as I said) I mind no Instance in the <HI>New-Testament:</HI> And in the <HI>Old</HI> we see, though it was strange that little <HI>David</HI> should oppose himself to the great <HI>Goliah,</HI> yet he had, before that, killed both the Lion and the Bear, which was no less improbable; and which of all is most observable, was, before that Time, by the Appointment of God, and the Hand of the Prophet, anointed King of <HI>Israel.</HI> Com∣pare the 16th and 17th Chapters of the First of <HI>Samuel.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assertion 3 proved.</NOTE> Now, as to the Third, <HI>That any particular Persons,</HI> de Facto, <HI>or effectu∣ally giving out a positive Judgment, is no encroaching nor imposing upon their Brethrens Conscience,</HI> is necessarily included in what is said be∣fore; upon which, for further Probation, there will only need this short Reflection: That for any Member or Members, in Obedience to the Lord, to give forth a positive Judgment in the Church of Christ, is their proper Place and Of∣fice, they being called to it; and so for them to
<PB N="95" REF="007840_0102_102DB660374D8C08"/>
exercise that Place in the Body, which the Head moves them to, is not to usurp Authority over their Fellow Members. As, on the other Hand, to submit and obey (it being the Place of some so to do) is not a renouncing a being led by the Spirit, seeing the Spirit leads them so to do: And not to obey, in case the Judgment be ac∣cording to Truth, and the Spirit lead to it, is, no Doubt, both offensive and sinful. And that all this may be supposed in the Church of Christ without Absurdity, and so establish the above∣mentioned Propositions, will appear by a short Review of the former Passages.</P>
<P>If that <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> their giving a positive Judgment in the Case of Difference in divers Particulars, did not infer them to be <HI>Imposers,</HI> so neither will any so doing now, being led to it by the same Authority: Every one may easily make the Application. And, on the contrary, if for any to have stood up and resisted their Judg∣ment, pretending an Unclearness, or so, and thereby held up the Difference after their Sen∣tence, breaking the Peace and Unity of the Church (Things being con∣cluded with an <HI>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us</HI>) I say, if such would have given just Cause of Offence, and have been cut off, as <HI>Despisers of Dignities</HI> of old, will not the like Case, now occurring, hold the same Conclu∣sion? Now, whether those Popositions do not hold, upon the Principles before laid down and proved, I leave to every judicious and impartial Reader to judge. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 15.21.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="007840_0103_102DB6621B538390"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Submission and Obedi∣ence to the Judgment of Truth, the Spirit of God leads into.</NOTE> Moreover, we see how positive the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> is in many Particulars throughout all his Epistles, insomuch as he saith, 2 <HI>Thess. ult. v. 14, If any Man obey not our Word by this Epistle, note that Man, and have no Company with him, that he may be ashamed.</HI> And in many more Places, be∣fore mentioned, where he commands them both to obey him, and several others, who were appointed (no Doubt by the Spirit of God) to be Rulers among them; and yet, who will say, that either the Apostle did more than he ought, in commanding; or they less than they were obliged to, in submitting? And yet neither were to do any Thing contrary, or more than the Spirit of God in themselves led them to, or allowed them in. And if the Church of God bear any Parity or Proportion now in these Days with what it did of old (as I know no Reason why it should not) the same Things may now be supposed to take Effect that did then, and also be lawfully done upon the like Occasion, proceeding from the same Spirit, and established upon the same Basis and Foundation. And thus much, as to that Part, to shew <HI>in whom the Power of Decision is:</HI> Which being seriously and impartially considered, is suf∣ficient to clear us from the Tyranny, either of <HI>Popery,</HI> or any other of that Nature, with those that are not either wilfully blind, or very igno∣rant of <HI>Popish</HI> Principles, as the judicious Reader may observe. But seeing <HI>to mainfest that Dif∣ference</HI> was one of those Things proposed to be considered of, I shall now come to say something of it in its proper Place.</P>

<P>Now, if to deny every one of these Proposi∣tions, wherein all understanding Men know the Errors and Abuses of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church consist, be to be <HI>Popish;</HI> then indeed may we be supposed to be one with the <HI>Papists</HI> in this Matter, but not o∣therwise: So that the very mentioning of these Things is sufficient to shew the Difference betwixt us and them. But if any will needs plead our Agreement with them thus;</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection.</NOTE> <HI>The</HI> Papists <HI>affirm an</HI> Infallibility of Judgment <HI>in the Church of Christ, and so do you; therefore you are one with</HI> Papists.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer 1.</NOTE> I answer; That proves no more our Oneness in this Matter, than if it should be said, <HI>The</HI> Papists <HI>plead that God ought to be worshipped, and so do you; therefore ye agree:</HI> Not∣withstanding of the vast Differences as to that, which is not only known betwixt us and them, but betwixt them and all <HI>Protestants,</HI> who agree more with them in the Matter of Worship than we do.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer 2.</NOTE> Next again, <HI>Infallibillity</HI> in the Church (according as we hold it. and I have above defined it) no Man upon our Supposition (or <HI>Hypothesis</HI>) can de∣ny. For since we first assert, as a Principle, that no Gathering, no Church, nor Assembly of People, however true their Principles, or <NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Church is led by the Infal∣lible Spirit</NOTE>

exact their Form be, are to be accounted the Church of Christ, except the <HI>infallible Spirit</HI> lead and guide; what can be the Hazard to say, that in such a Church there is still an infallible Judgment? Indeed this is so far from <HI>Popery,</HI> that it resolves in a Proposition quite contradicto∣ry to them. The <HI>Romanists</HI> say, <HI>That the</HI> infal∣lible Spirit <HI>always accompanies the outward visi∣ble Professors, and is annexed to the</HI> eternal Succes∣sion <HI>of Bishops and Pastors, though ever so vicious, as to their Lives: Yea, though per∣fect</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">For some Popes have been known to deny, or at least to doubt the Truth of the Scriptures as to the History of Christ, and to call in Question the immortality of the Soul, and the Re∣surrection.</NOTE> Atheists <HI>and</HI> Infidels <HI>in their private Judgments, yet if outward∣ly professing the</HI> Catholick Faith, <HI>and</HI> Subjection to the Church, <HI>they must be Partakers of the</HI> infallible Spirit. We say the quite con∣trary: That where there is either Viciousness of Persons, of Unsound∣ness of Judgment in the particular Members, these cannot, by Virtue of any outward Call or Succession they have, or any Profession they make, or Authority they may pretend to, so much as claim an Interest in any Part of the Church of Christ, or the <HI>infallible Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The infallible Judgment where it is.</NOTE> So then, if we admit none to be Members of the Church but such as are led and guided by the Spirit, it will be no <HI>Popery,</HI> in the second Place, to affirm, that where there is a Company of People so gathered, who are not any longer to retain justly the Name of the Church of Christ than they are led and guided by his
<PB N="101" REF="007840_0108_102DB66D791B7DD8"/>
Spirit, or a Church so qualified and designed, there is still an <HI>infallible Judgment.</HI> So that this <HI>Infallibility</HI> is not annexed to the Persons, to the Succession, to the bare visible Profession (though true, which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is denied to be) or to any Society, because of its Profession; but singly, and alone to the true, real and effectual Work of <HI>Sanctification</HI> and <HI>Regeneration,</HI> the <HI>New Creature</HI> brought forth in the Heart: And this is the <HI>Spiritual Man,</HI> which the Apostles faith, <HI>judgeth all Things,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.15. To affirm there is an <HI>Infallibility</HI> here, cannot well be condemned by any; or whoso doth, mud needs say, the Spirit of God is <HI>fallible:</HI> For we place the <HI>Infallibility</HI> in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and in the <HI>Power,</HI> not in the <HI>Persons.</HI> And so these are the Degrees we ascend by; <Q>Because such and such Men are led by the Spi∣rit of God, and are obedient to the Grace in their Hearts, therefore are they Members and Officers in the Church of Christ. And because they are Members of the Church of Christ in the Respect before declared, therefore there is an <HI>infallible Judgment</HI> among them.</Q> We do not say, Because such Men profess the Christian Faith, and have received an outward Ordination, and so are by a lawful Succession formally esta∣blished Officers in the Church, when they meet together (according to certain Rules above de∣clared) there is an <HI>Infallibility</HI> annexed to their <HI>Conclusions,</HI> and they cannot but decide what is <HI>right;</HI> or rather, what they decide must needs be supposed to be <HI>right.</HI> Who seeth not here a vast Disproportion?</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Constitu∣tion of a Sy∣nod, or a ge∣neral Council among—</NOTE> Now we differ herein fundamentally; that is, as to the very Basis and Foundation upon which we build; and that not only from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> but also from the Generality of <HI>Protestants</HI> in this Matter. All <HI>Protestants</HI> do acknowledge a <HI>gene∣ral Council</HI> to be useful, yea ne∣cessary, in the Case of Division or Debate; let us consider the Basis upon which they proceed, and the Stress they lay upon it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>They decide by <HI>Plurality of Votes.</HI> And tho' they assume not an <HI>absolute Infallibility,</HI> in that they reckon it possible for them to err, yet do they reckon their Decisions obligatory upon their supposed Consonancy to the Scripture; and how∣ever do affirm, That the Civil Magistrate hath Power to constrain all to submit and obey; or else to punish them either by Death, Banishment, Imprisonment, Confiscation of Goods, or some other corporal Pain; even though such be per∣suaded, and offer to make appear, that the De∣cisions they refuse, are contrary to the Scrip∣tures.</P>

above declared, can be admitted to sit, vote, and give his Judgment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3. We differ from them both.</NOTE> Any that will be at the Pains to apply this to the Foundation I before laid of the <HI>Infallibility</HI> of Judgment, in that we may account only to be truly called the Church of Christ, will easily see the great Difference betwixt us, which I shall sum up in these Particulars:</P>

<P N="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Do we plead that Decision is to pass conclusive, because of the Plurality of <HI>Votes?</HI></P>
<P>And much more, which the Reader may ob∣serve from what is already mentioned; which that it may be all more obvious at one <HI>View,</HI> will appear somewhat clearly by this following Figure; which will give the Reader an Oppor∣tunity to recollect what lay heretofore more scat∣tered.</P>

where may be also included Marriages, and the Removing of all Scandals in Things undeniably wrong.

Which again (to sub-divide) may either be in Things fundamental, and of great Moment; or in Things of less Weight in themselves, yet pro∣ceeding from a wrong Spirit, and which in the natural and certain Consequence of them, tend to make Schisms, Divisions, Animosities, and in Sum, to break that Bond of Love and Unity that is so needful to be upheld and established in the Church of Christ.
