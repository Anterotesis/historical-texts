<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publication of this ESSAY, to Quicken <HI>Early Piety,</HI> after so many that have gone before it, needs no Apology; for it is not Possible to make too many. The <HI>Subject</HI> is Copious; the <HI>Object</HI> is Nume∣rous; the <HI>Occasions</HI> are Infinite.</P>
<P>The SERMON which is now laid before the Reader, has nothing <HI>Extraordi∣nary</HI> in the Composure of it. He has in∣deed here only the First, Rude, Untran∣scribed and so Unpolished Notes of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> Written and Preached by One, who is pretty tolerably Employ'd at Con∣stant, and Frequent Preaching. But the <HI>Importance</HI> of it is <HI>Extraordinary;</HI> and some∣times the less of <HI>Polishment,</HI> the more does
<PB REF="001564_0003_0FB3AF4906225BB8"/>
the Sovereign Grace of Heaven give Suc∣cess to our <HI>Plain Discourses.</HI> Before the <HI>Sermon</HI> is out, the Reader will see why &amp; whence it comes unto him; yea, surely he <HI>will Hear,</HI> when he finds, That <HI>One comes unto him from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>Instead of going to <HI>Tullies Offices,</HI> I will go to <HI>Ambrose</HI>'s for a brief Recital of the Ornaments with which we would Fain see our Young People Beautified▪ <HI>Honor Adoluscentum est, Timorem Dei habere; Parent thus deferre; Honorem habere seniori∣bus; Castitatem non aspernari; diligere Cle∣mentiam et Verecundiam quae Ornamenta sunt Juvenilis Aetatis.</HI> Oh! Let 'em Fear God, Honour their Parents and their Betters; Preserve Chastity, Clemency, and Modesty. This is all wee'll ask for.</P>

<P>IT is then an <HI>Angelical Service</HI> which I am upon. To bring the Messa∣ges of Heaven to <HI>Young Men,</HI> is an <HI>Angelical Service.</HI> It seems there is not an <HI>Angel</HI> in the Blessed Realms of Light, but what would rejoice to ar∣rive among you, on the Service &amp; the Er∣rand
<PB N="2" REF="001564_0005_0FB3AF4CF21365A0"/>
wherein the <HI>Chief of Sinners</HI> is now Engaged. If I keep close to my <HI>Instructi∣ons,</HI> and bring to you nothing but what is Propounded and Supported, from the <HI>Ora∣cles</HI> of God, which I shall Endeavour to do, you will hear nothing, but what will call for as much Regard, as if it were bro't by an <HI>Angel</HI> from Heaven. Sirs, What if you should this Day see, what the Belo∣ved <HI>John</HI> saw upon a <HI>Lords-Day</HI> of old; An <HI>Angel</HI> flying among you, with the <HI>Everlast∣ing Gospel</HI> to Preach unto you; and saying with a Loud Voice; <Q>O all People, and very Particularly O Young People, Fear God, and give Glory to Him!</Q> Certainly, You would hear with much Attention, with much Af∣fection, with a most awful Reverence. Behold, A very Sinful Man, but coming in the Name of the most Glorious LORD, brings to you, the <HI>Everlasting Gospel;</HI> He <HI>Runs</HI> to bring it, unto the <HI>Young People</HI> in the Neighbourhood. It is no other than what an <HI>Angel</HI> from Heaven, would be willing to bring among you; and it is as awfully to be Regarded!</P>
<P>Our Prophet <HI>Zechariah,</HI> was favoured with an Apparition of an <HI>Angel</HI> unto him; and the <HI>Angel</HI> in this Exhibition, gave him
<PB N="3" REF="001564_0006_0FB3AF4ED31D6308"/>
a Prospect of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> going to be laid out, and rebuilt, under the Influences of the God, who sets Bounds to our Habita∣tions. This <HI>Angel</HI> is met by another <HI>An∣gel,</HI> who brings him an Order from God, immediately to <HI>Run unto that Young Man, and speak unto him</HI> something that it would be very Profitable and very Comfortable for him to be acquainted withal.</P>
<P>In <HI>Imitation</HI> of that <HI>Good Angel;</HI> and who can be better imitated? — I will now <HI>Run</HI> and <HI>Speak</HI> unto those <HI>Young</HI> Persons whom I have now before me, some very Observable Things: And you will see anon, perhaps with some Surprize, my <HI>Text</HI> admirably supplying me, with all my Observations.</P>
<P>There is first a <HI>General Doctrine,</HI> which I shall bring unto you; and make it a most agreeable <HI>Preliminary</HI> &amp; <HI>Introduction,</HI> unto the more Particular <HI>Instructions,</HI> that are to Ensue upon it. And this is,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>The DOCTRINE.</HI> There are things of no small Importance, which the Great <HI>GOD</HI> orders to be spoken unto Young Persons; yea, to be Earnestly spoken unto them.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001564_0007_0FB3AF500689E788"/>There is not a <HI>Young Man</HI> among us, but the Great GOD has given Order, <HI>Speak to this Young Man.</HI> Yea, My Child, The Great GOD <HI>Himself</HI> speaks unto thee The <HI>Maxims of Piety</HI> are those Important Things, which the Great GOD Orders to be spoken, unto all the Children of Men. The Maxims are addressed in those very Terms; Psal. XLIX. 1. <HI>Hear this All ye People, give ear All ye Inhabitants of the World.</HI> But they that are <HI>Children in Age,</HI> are very Particularly to look on themselves, as con∣cerned in the Address of such Things. <HI>Young Persons</HI> must not look on themselves unconcerned in he <HI>Maxims of Piety;</HI> Those Things are of as much Importance unto <HI>Young Persons,</HI> as unto any in the World; The Voice of God which utters those Things, is as much Directed unto <HI>Young Persons</HI> as unto any in the World.</P>
<P>We will at once Enquire; <HI>How tis that the Great</HI> GOD <HI>Speaks unto Young Persons:</HI> and, <HI>What are the most Important Things that He would have to be Spoken unto them?</HI></P>
<P>Our Answer to these Complicated En∣quiries, is this.</P>
<P>First. There are Important Things, which the Great GOD speaks unto <HI>Young
<PB N="5" REF="001564_0008_0FB3AF516511A3A8"/>
Persons,</HI> in the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> the Light of <HI>Natural Reason,</HI> that which <HI>Enlightneth every Man that comes into the World.</HI> It is of all things, the most Evident; <HI>There is a Spirit in man, and the Inspiration of the Al∣mighty has given him an Ʋnderstanding,</HI> of much <HI>Duty</HI> which he owes to his Almighty Maker. The Rational Spirit of man, is apprized of, and furnished with, certain <HI>Principles,</HI> which are instamped thereon, by the <HI>God who forms the Spirit of man within him.</HI> The Inwrought, the Innate <HI>Princi∣ples,</HI> in the <HI>Rational Spirit</HI> of man, dispose him to acknowledge Things <HI>Good</HI> &amp; <HI>Evil,</HI> Things <HI>Right</HI> &amp; <HI>Wrong;</HI> as well as Things <HI>True</HI> &amp; <HI>False.</HI> Tho' he may not always make the <HI>Actual Acknowledgment,</HI> yet if the <HI>Light</HI> be brought unto him, or things be set in their due <HI>Light</HI> before him, he is quickly Compell'd unto it. We read, Prov. XX. 27. <HI>The Spirit of man is the Candle of the Lord.</HI> Young People, The Great GOD has Lighted His <HI>Candle</HI> in your Souls. You Know, and you cannot but Own, That <HI>there is a GOD,</HI> unto whom you owe all possible Homage and Obedi∣ence. You Know, and you cannot but Own, That you are base Wretches, if you
<PB N="6" REF="001564_0009_0FB3AF5546BD1130"/>
don't <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Obey,</HI> and <HI>Requite</HI> your <HI>Parents.</HI> You Know, and you cannot but Own, That in your Dealings with your Neighbours, you <HI>ought to do as you would be done unto.</HI> These Three things are as Plain, as that Three and Three make Six. If you do but behold, the <HI>Works</HI> of God, in the <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the World, these will Proclaim such Things unto you; God speaks unto you such Things as these by all the <HI>Works of His Hands.</HI> The <HI>Dictates</HI> of the <HI>Conscience</HI> within you, are awakened, are inferred, are confirmed, from all the <HI>Works</HI> of God about you. You may Rea∣sonably Gather many Lessons of Piety, from all the <HI>Works of God;</HI> yea, <HI>There is no Speech nor Language, where their Voice is not heard.</HI> Alas, if you <HI>Forget</HI> God, or if you <HI>Abuse</HI> one another, you <HI>Rebel against the Light,</HI> with which the God that <HI>Made</HI> you, and <HI>Form'd</HI> you, has accommodated you. God speaks unto you, and you stop your Ears a∣gainst the Voice, that should make the Pillars of Heaven to tremble. You have a <HI>Conscience</HI> which terribly Condemns you for your Wickedness. If you <HI>Go on</HI> still in doing Wickedly, you may Rationally Conclude, that the Great God speaks this
<PB N="7" REF="001564_0010_0FB3AF578FD74858"/>
also unto you; <HI>Rebel, He that Made thee will not have Mercy on thee, &amp; He that Form'd thee, will shew thee no Favour.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There are Important Things which the Great GOD speaks unto <HI>Young Persons,</HI> in the <HI>Spectacles,</HI> which they have before them, in the Dispensations of His Providence. There are Two sorts of <HI>Spectacles,</HI> wherewith Young Persons are continually Entertained by the Providence of God. One thing daily to be seen by <HI>Young Persons,</HI> is that; Prov XIII. 21. <HI>E∣vil pursueth Sinners.</HI> Children, You see such as are <HI>Wicked Overmuch, Dy before their Time.</HI> You see, Such as won't keep their <HI>Tongues from Evil,</HI> don't <HI>see Many Days,</HI> or <HI>much Good</HI> in their Days. You see Profane, Vitious, <HI>Debauched</HI> Children, soon Plung'd into woful Miseries. You see <HI>Ʋndutiful</HI> Children Cut off by the tre∣mendous Vengeance of God. You see Heaven Discharging its Thunderbolts on the Heads of them that will <HI>Go on still in their Trespasses.</HI> The Great God speaks to you in what you see. The Thundring Voice of God unto you, in such <HI>Spectacles,</HI> is, <HI>O take heed of all Impiety. O don't by work of Darkness, pull down upon your
<PB N="8" REF="001564_0011_0FB3AF59298885C8"/>
selves the Strange Punishments reserved in outer Darkness, for the Workers of Iniquity!</HI> Another thing daily to be seen by <HI>Young Persons,</HI> is that: Job XXXVI. 14. <HI>They Dy in Youth.</HI> Children, You see <HI>all Ages</HI> liable to the stroke of <HI>Death.</HI> You see <HI>Children Dy</HI> as well as <HI>Old Men;</HI> Ten times more Dy before Twenty than After Sixty. You see <HI>Children</HI> carried from the <HI>Cradle</HI> to the <HI>Sepulchre;</HI> and Graves in the Burying-place, that are shorter than the Youngest of you. You see <HI>Children Dy</HI> as well as they that are an <HI>Hundred years old; Infants</HI> Lock'd up in Coffins; and as they use to say, <HI>Skulls of all Sizes in Golgotha.</HI> You see, Some with whom the <HI>Sun goes down at Noon,</HI> and some with whom the <HI>Morning</HI> is turn'd into the <HI>Shadow of Death.</HI> The Great God speaks to you, in what you see. The Lively Voice of God unto you in such <HI>Spectacles,</HI> is; <HI>O don't vainly Promise a long Life unto your selves. O do not upon a vain Presumption of a long Life, put off your Pre∣parations for Death, and your laying hold on Eternal Life!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. There are Important Things, which the Great GOD speaks unto <HI>Young Persons,</HI> in His Glorious <HI>Gospel;</HI> that <HI>Grace</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001564_0012_0FB3AF5A6A770C48"/>
of His, which does <HI>bring Salvation;</HI> that <HI>Voice of Him that speaks from Heaven.</HI> Young Persons have the <HI>Bible</HI> in their Hands, the Book of God, and of Life; the <HI>Scripture given by Inspiration of God.</HI> It may be said of our Children, as 2 Tim III. 15. <HI>From a Child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto Salva∣tion.</HI> The Parents will be inexcusable, and more Uncompassionate unto their Off∣spring than <HI>Ostriches</HI> and <HI>Sea-monsters,</HI> and must not be called, <HI>Christian Parents,</HI> if they do not what they can, that their <HI>Children</HI> may have the <HI>Bible</HI> in their Hands, and in their Minds. Children, You have the Great GOD speaking to you in the <HI>Bible.</HI> When ever you look into the <HI>Bible,</HI> it should be with this <HI>Perswasion;</HI> you should often look into the Bible on this <HI>Intention; I will hear what God will speak unto me!</HI> The Voice of the Great God unto you in your <HI>Bible</HI> is that; Psal. XXXIV. 11. <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the Fear of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Bible</HI> is a <HI>Letter from Heaven</HI> as much unto <HI>you,</HI> as if your very Name, were in the Superscription of it. And that you may be the more sensible of God speaking unto you here,
<PB N="10" REF="001564_0013_0FB3AF5C0ED122F8"/>
you are here yet more distinguishingly call'd upon. So you are, Eccl XII. 1. <HI>Re∣member now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</HI> So you are, Psal. CXLVIII. 12, 13. <HI>Both young Men and Maidens, old Men &amp; Children. Let them Praise the Name of the Lord.</HI> So you are, in all the Scriptural Ex∣amples of <HI>Early Piety.</HI> But besides this; When the Word of God is Opened and Applied in the <HI>Sermons</HI> of His Ministers; <HI>young Persons</HI> make a part of our Audi∣tory. <HI>Young Persons</HI> are to take their Portion in all the <HI>Sermons</HI> of the Evange∣lical Ministry, wherein Wisdom says unto them, <HI>Ʋnto you, O Men, I Call, and my Voice is to the Sons of Men.</HI> Yea, the Prudent and Faithful <HI>Stewards</HI> in the House of God, will sometimes Carve out a <HI>Special Portion</HI> for the <HI>Young Persons</HI> in their Auditory. The Servants of God will be careful to avoid that Character of the Foolish Shep∣herd; Zach▪ XI. 16▪ <HI>Which shall not seek the young one.</HI> Children, When <HI>Sermons</HI> are Preaching, you have the Great GOD speaking to you in them. Instead of <HI>Sport∣ing,</HI> or <HI>Sleeping,</HI> or any Irreverent Carri∣age here, Oh, with what <HI>Reverence and Godly Fear</HI> ought you to behave your selves;
<PB N="11" REF="001564_0014_0FB3AF5D64F17560"/>
and think, <HI>How dreadful is this Place? Tis the House of God, and the Gate of Heaven! Tis not a weak Man, but the Great GOD, who is now speaking to me!</HI> It is the Great GOD, who tells you in our Sermons, That you need a <HI>Saviour;</HI> and that you will find the Lovely JESUS, a Mighty, a Rea∣dy, and an Only Saviour. It is the Great GOD who tells you, That you must Walk in His <HI>Fear,</HI> and in all <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> before Him. It is the Great GOD, who tells you, That <HI>He will bring every Work into Judgment, and Reward every man ac∣cording to His Work.</HI> You are Deaf to GOD, if you hear us not!</P>
<P>There is an <HI>Improvement,</HI> which the Great GOD has Ordered me to make of these things. There is this thing to be spoken, yea, to be <HI>Earnestly Spoken,</HI> unto the <HI>Young People</HI> in this Assembly of <HI>Zion: Oh! Take a due Notice of the Things, which the Great GOD Orders to be spoken to you;</HI> Children, Pay a due Respect unto those things! Methinks, I overhear the Holy One saying to me, <HI>Run, Speak to these Young People.</HI> To <HI>Run,</HI> is the Motion of one in <HI>Earnest.</HI> I must now be <HI>in Earnest</HI> with you. Children, That which I am <HI>Earnest∣ly</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001564_0015_0FB3AF6016C48D60"/>
to speak unto you, is this; GOD has been speaking to you; <HI>The Mighty</HI> GOD, <HI>even the</HI> LORD <HI>hath Spoken</HI> to you. Now, Oh! Mind what He speaks; Let the <HI>Voice of God</HI> have a due, and a deep Im∣pression upon you. What a Blessed Inter∣course was that between the Great GOD, and the Child <HI>Samuel!</HI> 1 Sam. III. 10. <HI>And the Lord came, &amp; stood &amp; called as at other times,</HI> Samuel, Samuel. <HI>Then</HI> Samuel <HI>an∣swered, Speak for thy Servant Heareth.</HI> O Young People, The Great GOD comes, &amp; stands, &amp; calls unto thee very many times over; <HI>Sinner, Sinner, Soul Perishing in thy Sin, O Forsake thy Sin, and Embrace thy Saviour!</HI> Under the Admonitions of God, O Children, Be able to answer; <HI>Lord, I hear what thou speakest; and I desire to be thy Servant. The Commands, the Comforts, the Reproofs of thy Word, Lord, Thy Servant would hearken to them.</HI></P>
<P>The Thing which I have to demand of you, is; That you cast no Scorn upon the <HI>Word of God;</HI> but that you Comply with the <HI>Voice of God</HI> speaking to you in His Word. The Demand is, That you <HI>Mind,</HI> and that you <HI>Do</HI> those things, which God shall speak unto you; and be <HI>ashamed</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001564_0016_0FB3AF61D317AA30"/>
of not having <HI>Respect unto all His Command∣ments. Child,</HI> He is thy <HI>Father,</HI> and He should be, Oh! Let thy Choice make Him, <HI>the Guide of thy Youth.</HI> We read of some Young People, 1 Joh. II. 14. <HI>Ye are Strong, and the Word of God abideth in you.</HI> Oh! Give a due Reception to the <HI>Word of God. Lodge</HI> it in your Understandings, your Me∣mories, your Affections. <HI>Hide</HI> it in your <HI>Hearts,</HI> with dispositions to be thereby Preserved and Rescued from your <HI>Sins.</HI></P>
<P>To Enforce this <HI>Early Piety</HI> on our Chil∣dren, I will <HI>Run,</HI> and <HI>Earnestly Speak</HI> these two things unto them. Yea, you shall pre∣sently see, that the Great GOD has Or∣dered me to speak these things.</P>
<P>The First Thing is, <HI>That the Great</HI> GOD <HI>will deal with you, as you deal with His Word.</HI> Children, <HI>Love</HI> the Word of God, and God will Place His <HI>Love</HI> upon you. <HI>Treasure</HI> up the Word of God, and God will make you His Peculiar <HI>Treasure. Con∣tain</HI> the Word of God, and your Portion from God shall be <HI>Shame and Everlasting Contempt.</HI> O that your <HI>Ears</HI> were open to this <HI>Discipline,</HI> and that such an <HI>Instruction</HI> as this from and for the Word of God were <HI>Sealed</HI> unto you. It speaks thus;
<PB N="14" REF="001564_0017_0FB3AF62C95E6C18"/>
<HI>Them that Honour me, the GOD that speaks in me will Honour; they who Despise me, shall be lightly Esteemed of the GOD who shines &amp; breathes in me.</HI></P>
<P>I remember a Remarkable Passage, 2 Tim. I. 12, 14. <HI>He is able to keep, that which I have committed unto Him.</HI> And, <HI>That good thing which was committed unto thee, do thou keep.</HI> The Jews mention Two <HI>Depositums</HI> of God; The <HI>Lamp</HI> within us, or, the <HI>Soul;</HI> And the <HI>Lamp</HI> without us, or, the <HI>Law;</HI> and they introduce the Great GOD speaking thus unto us; <HI>My Lamp which is my Law, is in thy Hand; and thy Lamp, which is thy Soul, is in Mine. If thou diligently keep My Lamp, I will keep thine; if thou put out, if thou tread on, My Lamp, I will deal so with thine.</HI> Our Apostle seems to have an Eye on both of these, <HI>Deposita.</HI> GOD will <HI>Re∣quire</HI> it, when His Word is Well-treated with Young People; will <HI>Revenge</HI> it, when His Word is ill-treated: <HI>Ye have done it unto me, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Thing is like unto it; in∣deed but a Continuation &amp; Amplification of it. It is, <HI>That the Great</HI> GOD <HI>will hear you, Speaking and Praying to Him, as you hear Him Speaking to you.</HI> Children, Be you
<PB N="15" REF="001564_0018_0FB3AF64307EEEA8"/>
never so <HI>Prayerless</HI> now, there will come a Time, when you will pour out your Prayer unto the Almighty. In the <HI>Trouble</HI> that will at some Time come upon you, you will <HI>Visit Him</HI> on your Knees, and <HI>Pour out a Prayer,</HI> when His <HI>Chastening</HI> shall be upon you, and drive you to it. Now, be ad∣vised. <HI>The Lord God hath Spoken this, and who can but Prophesy it?</HI> The Word of God comes to you, with such a Pathetical Warning as that wherewith <HI>Jotham</HI> once began his Parable; <HI>Hearken unto me, that God may hearken unto you!</HI> If you will hear the <HI>Counsels</HI> of God, God will hear your <HI>Prayers.</HI> It was a sweet Word, Joh: XV. 7. <HI>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</HI> When the Great GOD sees, That you set your selves <HI>to Do,</HI> what∣ever He shall <HI>Speak</HI> to you, and <HI>Ask</HI> of you, Lo, He says upon it; <HI>This is a dear Child; I will do for Him for above all that he can ask or think; yea, before he calls, I will answer, and whiles he is yet speaking, I will hear.</HI> But I am to step into Mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> for the other part of my Prophecy; If God Speak, and you Disregard what He Speaks, and if you <HI>turn away from Him that
<PB N="16" REF="001564_0019_0FB3AF65B0FA6420"/>
speaks from Heaven,</HI> and if you <HI>Reject the Counsels of God;</HI> Such, even such will be the <HI>Disregard</HI> that your <HI>Prayer</HI> to Him shall meet withal. Can any thing be more <HI>Dreadful,</HI> but can any thing be more <HI>Equal,</HI> than that Indignation of Heaven Zech. VI. 13. <HI>Therefore it is come to pass, that as He Cried, and they would not hear,; so they Cried, and I would not hear, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> Oh! Tremble before the terrible Threatning of God; and forget not that Young People are Peculiarly Threatned in it; Prov. I. 24, 25 28. <HI>Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my Counsel, and would none of my Reproof: Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me Early, but they shall not find me. Hear</HI> this, O all you Children of Unperswadeableness, that <HI>will not Hear.</HI> You will One Day lift up the Cries of a Distressed Soul unto the Lord; When the <HI>Griefs of Death</HI> compass you, and the <HI>Pains of Hell</HI> get hold on you, with what Agony of Soul, will you then Cry unto the Lord; <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver my Soul!</HI> But, O the Confusion which you are providing and bespeaking
<PB N="17" REF="001564_0020_0FB3AF677B6D16C8"/>
for your selves! O the <HI>Wrath</HI> which you are <HI>heaping up!</HI> When God speaks to you in His Wrath, what will it be but this? <HI>Wretch, Thou wouldest not hear me; I spake unto thee in thy Prosperity, and thou wouldst not hear; Now, I know thee not, O worker of Iniquity!</HI> Children, Consider these things, which at the Order of God, I have thus <HI>Run</HI> to speak unto you.</P>
<P>Having thus Employ'd and even with a <HI>Running Dispatch</HI> Apply'd a <HI>General Doctrine;</HI> I will proceed unto certain more Particu∣lar <HI>Instructions.</HI> Things, that God Or∣ders to be spoken unto you. And they shall be only such <HI>Instructions</HI> as the Ten∣dency and Intention of my <HI>Text</HI> shall give me a clear Commission to offer unto you.

<P><HI>Run, Speak to this Young Man.</HI> Who, and what was this <HI>Young Man?</HI> A <HI>Zecha∣riah,</HI> who, tho' a <HI>Young Man,</HI> yet was a <HI>Servant</HI> of God; yea, a <HI>Prophet</HI> of God,

One improved in Eminent Service for Him. A <HI>Young Man,</HI> and yet sent by God unto His People, to say unto them, <HI>Turn ye unto me, saith the Lord.</HI> It is very sure, he had himself then in his Youth turned unto the Lord. It is the Note of a North-British Expositor upon it, <HI>God may Employ Young Men to Serve Him.</HI> Upon the bare Proposal of the matter, Oh! How can any Young Man in the Congregation, forbear that Ex∣clamation; Isa. VI. 8. Lord, <HI>Here am I; Send me!</HI> Hard-hearted Youth, who can hear of Serving such a Lord, and not long to become a <HI>Servant</HI> of that Glorious One! There were <HI>Services</HI> to be done for God, among His People of Old; But, who were used in those Excellent Services? We read, Exod. XXIV. 5. <HI>He sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings unto the Lord.</HI> There are <HI>Young Persons,</HI> who come and Chearfully put their Necks under the Golden Yoke of a most Gracious Redeemer. There are <HI>Young Persons,</HI> who are Inclin'd, and have Begun, to <HI>Live unto God,</HI> &amp; make the Will of God, the Rule of their Lives; and Submit unto the Will of God in dis∣posing their whole Condition for them

Yea, sometimes a Young <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> is used by the God of Heaven, to speak for Him unto Multitudes; A Young <HI>Jo∣siah,</HI> to make whole Provinces and Nati∣ons the better for him.</P>
<P>My Hearers, Require not of me, a <HI>De∣monstration</HI> of this Assertion. I Require it of YOU, That <HI>You</HI> be your selves the <HI>De∣monstration</HI> of it.

O <HI>Servants</HI> of all sorts in the Neighbour∣hood; You have put off the <HI>Service</HI> of the most Glorious One <HI>too Long,</HI> if you are gone into any <HI>Service</HI> before you have come into <HI>His.</HI> They that are too <HI>Young</HI> for any other <HI>Indentures,</HI> are <HI>Old</HI> enough to mind this Grand Concern: They that count themselves of a Quality <HI>too High</HI> for any other <HI>Indentures,</HI> cannot be <HI>too Big</HI> for these. But what am I saying? The <HI>Inden∣tures</HI> are already <HI>Sealed.</HI> O all ye <HI>Baptised</HI> ones; Your <HI>Baptism</HI> was the <HI>Seal</HI> of your <HI>Indentures,</HI> wherein you were Bound unto the Service of your Incomparable Saviour. The Thing required of you, is, That you now <HI>Renew</HI> the Consent of your Souls, unto your <HI>Baptismal Covenant.</HI> Let it be done in those Terms; Psal. CXIX. 94. <HI>I am thine, Save me.</HI> Let it be done with such Wishes; <HI>Oh! That I may be a Vessel of Honour for God the Father, a Loyal Subject of God the Son, a Living Temple of God the Spirit, for evermore!</HI> A Young Ser∣vant of God could say, <HI>O Lord, Truly I am thy Servant,</HI> (and over again,) <HI>I am thy Servant; I am the Son of thy Handmaid.</HI> The <HI>Church,</HI> whereof you are the Children, is the <HI>Handmaid of the Lord.</HI> Once has it

<P><HI>Young People</HI> may be those <HI>Children of God,</HI> who even while they are yet in their Youth, may be singularly dear unto the <HI>Angels of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001564_0025_0FB3AF6F6852B548"/>We have here a <HI>Young Man,</HI> who had one <HI>Angel</HI> talking in a most familiar Con∣versation, with him, and at the same time another <HI>Angel</HI> hastening a point of Infor∣mation to him. The <HI>Angels</HI> of God have often <HI>appeared like Young Men;</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> of God have much oftner had Pleasure in <HI>Religious Young Men.</HI> We read Mat. XVIII. 10. Even <HI>Little Ones have their Angels.</HI> There are <HI>Little Ones,</HI> for whose Welfare the <HI>Angels</HI> of God are concerned; <HI>Little Ones</HI> they are for their <HI>Growth,</HI> and still in their <HI>Youth;</HI> but yet the <HI>Angels</HI> of God are with unspeakable Pleasure, <HI>Ministring Spi∣rits</HI> for them, and go forth to <HI>Minister for those young Heirs of Salvation. Young Per∣sons</HI> there are, who are become very agree∣able to the <HI>Angels</HI> of God; The <HI>Angels</HI> of God are their <HI>Friends,</HI> and gladly take the Charge of them, and become their <HI>Friendly Guardians;</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> of God gladly do Kind <HI>Offices</HI> for them, &amp; multiply their <HI>Kindnesses</HI> to them. Yea, they <HI>Run,</HI> and are upon the <HI>Wing,</HI> in a Benign Mi∣nistry for them. There are <HI>Young Persons,</HI> for whom the <HI>Angels</HI> of God rejoyce to fulfil that Promise; Psal. XCI. 11. <HI>He shall give His Angels charge over thee, to keep
<PB N="23" REF="001564_0026_0FB3AF72143FCAC8"/>
thee in all thy ways.</HI> And that Promise; Psal. XXXIV. 7. <HI>The Angel of the Lord en∣campeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.</HI> The Young Persons are, <HI>Deliciae Angelici Generis;</HI> the Favourites of Heaven, and the <HI>Darlings of the Angelical World.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh! Who are those Happy Chil∣dren? You shall have a brief <HI>Description</HI> of them.</P>
<P>First, A Thorough and an Early <HI>Conver∣sion</HI> to God; This will be necessary. We read, Luk XV. 10. <HI>There is Joy in the presence of the Angels of God, over one Sinner that Re∣penteth.</HI> A Young Person becoming a <HI>New Creature,</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> of God are the Joyful Spectators of it; The <HI>Morning Stars do sing together at it, and the Sons of God shout for Joy.</HI> O <HI>Enemies</HI> of God, which His <HI>Angels</HI> with Abhorrence look upon; Re∣pent of your <HI>Enmity;</HI> Become the <HI>Converts of Zion;</HI> Then those <HI>Angels</HI> will come to be Glad that they have such <HI>New-born Chil∣dren</HI> of God under their <HI>Tuition.</HI></P>
<P>I go on. You must betimes be the <HI>Lo∣vers</HI> of the Glorious JESUS. Nothing, Nothing must be so Precious to you, as the Glorious JESUS. The <HI>Angels</HI> of God
<PB N="24" REF="001564_0027_0FB3AF750E815930"/>
Love Him; and Love those who do so; There is this <HI>Favour for them who Love Him in Sincerity.</HI> Those <HI>winged Inhabitants</HI> of Heaven, are the <HI>Wings</HI> of your Saviour. Oh! Make your continual Flights unto <HI>Him;</HI> Then those <HI>Wings</HI> will with Alacri∣ty stretch out themselves unto you; Take you under their Protection. The intense Lovers of JESUS, are the <HI>Disciples whom</HI> JESUS <HI>Loves.</HI> Have you not been told of a <HI>Young Man</HI> who came under this De∣nomination? Child, If JESUS <HI>Love</HI> thee, His <HI>Angels</HI> will do so too!</P>
<P>Once more; They are <HI>Holy Angels.</HI> Children, Don't Vex them, with <HI>Ʋnholy Practices. Ʋnholiness</HI> will disoblige them wonderfully. Urged unto any Wicked∣ness, Oh! Refuse it, Avoid it, with Young <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Detestation, <HI>How shall I do this Wick∣edness, and Sin against God?</HI> You will <HI>Please God,</HI> if you <HI>Walk with Him;</HI> and this will be marvellously Pleasing unto His <HI>Angels</HI> too. The Holy <HI>Angels</HI> are Glad, when they see a <HI>Young Man Holy in all manner of Conversation.</HI></P>
<P>But, Lastly; Shall we not bring in <HI>Good∣ness</HI> too? The <HI>Angels</HI> of God are <HI>Good An∣gels.</HI> They are Glad, when they see <HI>Young
<PB N="25" REF="001564_0028_0FB3AF765ABB3360"/>
People Good.</HI> Children, Be full of <HI>Goodness.</HI> Do no <HI>Wrong,</HI> Do no <HI>Harm,</HI> to any one in the World. Make the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of others your own, and Promote it what you can; and Sympathise with them in their <HI>Ad∣versity.</HI> Wish well to every one, and Do all the <HI>Good</HI> that ever you can. The <HI>Good Angels</HI> are Yours, O <HI>Greatly Beloved Ones,</HI> if you come to this!</P>
<P>In fine; We read of a wondrous Thing befalling a Young Man; 2 King. VI. 17. <HI>And</HI> Elisha <HI>Prayed, and said, Lord, I Pray thee, open his Eyes, that he may see, and the Lord opened the Eyes of the young man, and he saw: and behold the Mountain was full of Horses, and Chariots of Fire round about</HI> E∣lisha.</P>
<P>I will only Pray, <HI>Lord, Open the Eyes of every</HI> Young Man <HI>among us, to see the things of his Everlasting Peace; Turn the</HI> Young Man <HI>from Darkness to Light, with a Sancti∣fying work of thy Spirit upon Him!</HI> Then O Young Man, thou mightest see Fiery Cha∣riots of <HI>Angels,</HI> with a most Heavenly Gladness attending on thee! Ah! the Folly, Ah! the Madness, in the Heart of the Young Man, if this <HI>Consolation of God</HI> be <HI>Small</HI> unto Him!</P>

<HEAD>The Third Instruction.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Young Persons</HI> may be Admitted and Advanced unto an <HI>Intimate Communion with Heaven;</HI> Heaven may hold a most Gracious and Intimate <HI>Communion</HI> with them.</P>
<P>He was a <HI>Young Man,</HI> who had <HI>Heaven</HI> Opened unto him; who had the <HI>Angels of Heaven</HI> made very sensible unto him; who had the Great <HI>GOD of Heaven</HI> favouring of him with marvellous Communications. A <HI>Young Man</HI> may Dy and go to <HI>Heaven;</HI> yea, a <HI>Young Man</HI> may go to <HI>Heaven</HI> be∣fore he <HI>Dies;</HI> be well acquainted with the <HI>Heavenly World.</HI> Heaven is accessible for Young People as well as others. There are Young People, who are no strangers to <HI>Communion</HI> with Heaven: Young People to whom the Great GOD Communicates Himself with most Entertaining, most A∣stonishing Condescensions.</P>
<P>The CASE which remains now to be insisted on, is this.</P>
<P><HI>What is Communion with Heaven; and in what methods may</HI> Young Persons <HI>arrive to that Communion?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001564_0030_0FB3AF7982AABD40"/><HI>Communion with God;</HI> It is a Thing much <HI>Talked</HI> of; less <HI>Ʋnderstood,</HI> much less <HI>Pursued,</HI> least of all <HI>Attained.</HI> Chil∣dren, I would have you betimes take up Right <HI>Notions</HI> of this Blessedness, and Right <HI>Methods</HI> of attaining it.</P>
<P>Briefly, <HI>Communion with God,</HI> lies in <HI>Re∣ceiving</HI> from God, and in <HI>Rendering</HI> to Him.</P>
<P>First. The Great GOD holds <HI>Communi∣on</HI> with Young Persons, in what they <HI>Re∣ceive</HI> from Him. He holds <HI>Communion</HI> with them, in <HI>Communicating</HI> to them: You shall see this go on by Two Steps, unto a very <HI>Special Intimacy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Young Persons come to <HI>Commu∣nion</HI> with God, in the <HI>Communications</HI> of His <HI>Holy Word</HI> unto them. When God <HI>makes known</HI> His Mind &amp; Will unto Young Persons, then He has <HI>Communion</HI> with them. When He had <HI>Communion</HI> with <HI>Moses,</HI> it was in that; Exod. XXV. 22. <HI>I will Com∣mune with thee;</HI> or, Confer with thee. When God <HI>Speaks</HI> to you, Children, then He has <HI>Communion</HI> with you. Part of His <HI>Communion</HI> with you, is, His <HI>Revealing</HI> of Himself unto you, and His Acquaint∣ing you with what He would have you
<PB N="28" REF="001564_0031_0FB3AF7CEEEF3688"/>
to <HI>Know</HI> and to <HI>Do,</HI> that so you may <HI>Glorify Him and Enjoy Him for ever.</HI> O Reader of the Sacred Oracles, and of what Opens them; O Hearer of the Discourses which Explain and Apply the Sacred Oracles; O Mind Consulting the Will of God, as Written in thy own Soul, and Proclamed by what He has done <HI>in Heaven and in Earth, in the Seas and in all deep Places;</HI> The Great GOD has <HI>Com∣munion</HI> with thee, in all the <HI>Light,</HI> which by these things He Conveys unto thee. And the more Full, the more Clear, the more Irradiating and Satisfactory the <HI>Light</HI> is, the more <HI>Communion</HI> the Great GOD has with thee in the Conveyance of it. But then,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Children, You shall come yet nearer than so. <HI>Young Persons</HI> are taken into <HI>Communion</HI> with God, by the <HI>Com∣munications</HI> of His <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> unto them. The Communion that God has with them, is that; 2 Cor. XIII. 14. <HI>The communion of the Holy Spirit.</HI> In the impressions of the Holy Spirit on Young Persons, God has <HI>Communion</HI> with them. Children, Sometimes the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, will make unto you, most grateful <HI>Discoveries.</HI> He
<PB N="29" REF="001564_0032_0FB3AF7F8A52C2E0"/>
will <HI>Open</HI> your Eyes to <HI>behold the wondrous Things in His Law;</HI> He will Unfold unto you the <HI>Mysteries of His Gospel;</HI> He will cause you to Discern the <HI>Things that are spiritually to be discerned.</HI> More than so; The <HI>Spirit</HI> of God will go on to Sanctify you; and Purify you, and impart a <HI>Prin∣ciple of Grace</HI> unto you, and <HI>Strengthen</HI> that <HI>Principle</HI> in you, and Revive the <HI>Image of God</HI> in your Souls, and make you more Conformable to the <HI>Image</HI> of His <HI>Jesus,</HI> and Enkindle the <HI>Life of God</HI> in you, and Quicken you in <HI>Living unto God.</HI> This is not all; The <HI>Spirit</HI> of God will <HI>Excite</HI> you to the Things that are Well-pleasing to Him; Will <HI>Incline</HI> you to the Things that Please Him; Will <HI>Inspire</HI> you with <HI>Purposes</HI> of Well-doing, With Contrivances to Do Good; Will Animate you to <HI>Ser∣vices,</HI> and put you upon Abounding in the <HI>Fruits of Righteousness.</HI> In fine; The <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, will bring Home the <HI>Love</HI> of God into your Hearts; Will assure you of His Everlasting <HI>Love;</HI> Will com∣fort you with His Encouraging <HI>Promises;</HI> Will <HI>Seal</HI> you to the <HI>Day of Redemption;</HI> Will fill you with His <HI>Great Consolations;</HI> Will abolish your <HI>Griefs,</HI> extiguish your
<PB N="30" REF="001564_0033_0FB3AF80AD19F1B8"/>
<HI>Fears,</HI> enliven your <HI>Hopes,</HI> and cause you to <HI>Rejoyce with Joy Ʋnspeakable and full of Glory.</HI> Now in all these things, the Great GOD has <HI>Communion</HI> with you. O Soul Panting after Communion with GOD, mistake not the matter. Do not confine the Communion unto any one of these Fruitions. Child, Thy God has Commu∣nion with thee, when He <HI>Awakens</HI> thee, when He <HI>Abases</HI> thee, when He brings <HI>Con∣tritions</HI> upon thee, as well as when He Ra∣vishes thee with His <HI>Consolations which are not Small.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Young Persons hold <HI>Commu∣nion</HI> with the Great GOD, in what they <HI>Render</HI> to Him. The <HI>Returns,</HI> which Young Persons make unto God by His Assistence, these are their Communion with Him. Children, Your God calls for your <HI>Heart;</HI> He says; Prov. XXIII. 26. <HI>My Son, Give me thy Heart.</HI> You hold Communion with Him, when you give Him your <HI>Heart;</HI> when your <HI>Heart</HI> is filled with suitable Thoughts of Him; when you place the Desire of your <HI>Heart,</HI> the Delight of your <HI>Heart,</HI> the Dependence of your <HI>Heart</HI> upon Him. To <HI>Pray</HI> unto God, is to <HI>Commons</HI> with Him; When
<PB N="31" REF="001564_0034_0FB3AF825CEAD118"/>
Young Persons Repair to the Great GOD with the Request of their <HI>Heart,</HI> then they hold Communion with Him. If their <HI>Heart</HI> be in the Request, then tis an <HI>Hearty,</HI> a <HI>Real,</HI> a <HI>Proper</HI> Communion. Young Persons have Communion with the Great GOD, in every Acknowledgment they make of Him. They have Communion with Him in all their Ways, when they <HI>Ac∣knowledge Him in all their Ways.</HI> Indeed, Young Persons have <HI>Communion</HI> with God, in all their <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him. When God <HI>Requires</HI> and they <HI>Obey,</HI> there is a most a∣miable Communion between Him and Them. In short, To be <HI>Sensible</HI> of God, is to have <HI>Communion</HI> with Him. Young Persons Converse with God, when they <HI>Think of</HI> Him: when they <HI>Set the Lord be∣fore them;</HI> when they are <HI>Sensible</HI> of Him Speaking to them, or Dealing with them.</P>
<P>This is that <HI>Communion with Heaven</HI> whereto Young People may be admitted.</P>
<P>And, in what Ways may they now Seek and Gain Admission to it?</P>
<P>Children; The First Thing which I must mind you of, and Charge you to be ever mindful of, is this: Don't forget the <HI>Mercy-Seat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="001564_0035_0FB3AF85C27CE2F8"/>In the Blessed JESUS, thro' whom God becomes <HI>Propitious</HI> to us, you have the <HI>Mercy-Seat,</HI> whereof <HI>that</HI> on the <HI>Ark</HI> of old, was a Figure. In Him you see GOD Sitting <HI>on the Throne of Grace!</HI> Remember then; <Q>Without a Glorious JESUS, what Oh! What, would the Holy GOD be unto me? What, but a Consuming <HI>Fire</HI> and Everlasting <HI>Burnings!</HI> Ah, How could Sinful Stubble Draw near unto Him! It is my Glorious JESUS, who Reconciles me to God. Without such a Reconciliation, certainly, He could have no <HI>Communion</HI> with me; none, but in Thunder and Lightning, to Destroy me among <HI>His Adversaries!</HI> It is my Glo∣rious JESUS, that makes all my <HI>Homage</HI> to God be what it is: All my <HI>Offerings,</HI> tis <HI>He</HI> that enables me to bring them all. Tis in <HI>His Name</HI> that I bring them all: Tis thro' <HI>Him</HI> that I have <HI>Access unto the Father.</HI> Tis on <HI>His</HI> Account that they find Acceptance with God; We are <HI>Ac∣cepted in that Beloved One.</HI> O my Dear JESUS, To <HI>Thee</HI> am I beholden for all my <HI>Communion</HI> with God. <HI>How Dear, how Dear,</HI> ought this Glorious JESUS to be unto me!</Q> Children, The more of
<PB N="33" REF="001564_0036_0FB3AF86A8B474B8"/>
CHRIST you have with you, the more you may Expect of <HI>Communion</HI> with GOD.</P>
<P>Secondly; Tis in the <HI>Wayes</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of His own <HI>Appointment,</HI> that God will hold that <HI>Communion</HI> with Young Persons, for which He has appointed them. There are,</P>
<P>First, Ordinances of a more <HI>Publick Ce∣lebration,</HI> wherein Young Persons may have <HI>Communion</HI> with God; Such Ordi∣nances as are Celebrated in the <HI>Assemblies of Zion.</HI> The <HI>End</HI> why the All-wise God, has Instituted these things, is not meerly, that there may be the <HI>Work done;</HI> Tis not meerly to impose a <HI>Task</HI> upon us; No, They are <HI>Wayes</HI> and <HI>Means;</HI> and His <HI>End</HI> in them, is, That He may <HI>hold Com∣munion</HI> with His People in them. [See, Psal. XXVII. 4. And, 2 Cor. III. 18.] Yea, and He has Engaged Himself to hold <HI>Communion</HI> with His People in them. He hath said; Mat. XVIII. 20. <HI>Where Two or Three are Gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</HI> Concern∣ing these <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Lord, I shall advise our Children, with this <HI>Nurture &amp; Admonition of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="001564_0037_0FB3AF882AF9FBD0"/><HI>First;</HI> You can't Reasonably Expect such <HI>Communion</HI> with God, in any other <HI>Wayes</HI> and <HI>Means,</HI> as you may in those which Himself has <HI>Appointed.</HI> It is true; Such is the <HI>Compassion</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> that He has had Respect unto the <HI>Sincere Designs</HI> of some Good Men, when they used <HI>Indirect</HI> Wayes and Means for Communion with Him. He has regarded their <HI>Sincerity,</HI> and overlook'd their <HI>Superstition,</HI> and Visited their Souls, in the use of <HI>Liturgies,</HI> and of <HI>Holidays,</HI> which yet He has not approved. But men have no ground for any such Ex∣pectation, That God should Own them, when they go to put upon Him <HI>their own</HI> Wayes and Means of <HI>Communion</HI> with Him; That God should Own and Bless <HI>Humane Inventions;</HI> That God should come to us in the <HI>Modes</HI> wherewith we go to Prescribe unto the <HI>Holy One of Israel.</HI> The <HI>Second Commandment</HI> binds us up, to such <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>Communion</HI> with Him, as He Himself hath appointed. Now in that Commandment there is that awful Clause; Exod. XX. 5. <HI>I am a Jealous God.</HI> The <HI>Jealousy</HI> of the Holy God will burn against your <HI>Will-worship.</HI> Your <HI>Sub∣stitutions</HI> of, I know not what, in the room
<PB N="35" REF="001564_0038_0FB3AF89A4DC14B8"/>
of the Divine <HI>Institutions,</HI> They will En∣kindle the <HI>Jealousy</HI> of the Holy God. They will Provoke the Holy One to say, <HI>Who has required these things at your Hands? They are Vain Oblations: They are an Abo∣mination to me; I cannot away with 'em!</HI> Children of GOD, and, O Children of NEW-ENGLAND, if you would have <HI>Communion</HI> with <HI>God as your Father,</HI> and with the <HI>God of your Fathers,</HI> keep close to the <HI>Ways</HI> &amp; <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>His Appointment.</HI> Have <HI>His Warrant</HI> for all you do in <HI>His Worship.</HI> Then will He <HI>Commune</HI> with you.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly;</HI> You should Prize and Use all Opportunities of coming to the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> and count it a <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing to be Banished from the Opportunities to Bless God in His Congregations. Children, To make a <HI>Small Matter</HI> serve you, as an Ex∣cuse for your Absence from the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> truly, this were a very <HI>Bad Symptom</HI> upon you. Oh! Deprive not your selves, of this <HI>Token for Good</HI> on your Souls; <HI>Lord, I have Loved the Habitation of thy House!</HI> When any Calamity keeps you from the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> reckon this as a Considerable Article of the Calamity; Psal.

Let it be a Sorrowful thing unto you, when you can't <HI>Go with the Multitude unto the House of God.</HI> Let it broach your <HI>Tears,</HI> to think; <HI>I am now Banished from Communion with God!</HI> This Lamentation should be accompanied with some Essay, to <HI>fetch Good out of Evil.</HI> Wherefore, when you are kept at Home, O Humble your selves before God at Home. Humbly <HI>Search and Try your Wayes;</HI> And Humbly Confess; <HI>Lord, I did not Prize and Ʋse my Oppor∣tunities for Communion with thee in thy Sanc∣tuary, as I should have done, when I had those Opportunities. O Pardon me for the sake of the Great Sacrifice.</HI> Then Rumi∣nate on what you have been in the <HI>Sanctu∣ary</HI> formerly Entertained withal; and Resolve, with the Help of God, that if ever you come to the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> again, it shall be more Holily, more Livelily, more Fruitfully than ever in your Lives be∣fore.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly;</HI> Come to the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> always upon the <HI>true Intention;</HI> always intending and propounding of <HI>Communion</HI> with God. When you come to the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> let it not

be from <HI>Custom,</HI> for <HI>Credit,</HI> or any infe∣riour Account. Be able to give the Ge∣nuine Answer to that Question; <HI>What went you out for?</HI> Let it be, <HI>For Communi∣on with God.</HI> In coming up to the <HI>Sanctu∣ary,</HI> Children, Let the Cry of your Souls be that; Psal. LXIII. 1, 2. <HI>O God, Thou art my God, Early will I seek thee; To see thy Power and thy Glory in the Sanctuary.</HI> These, These must be the Dispositions of your Souls. <HI>It is good for me to draw near to God, and I am now going to draw near unto Him. In Precious Interviews with God there is laid up the Life of my Soul; and I am going to those Interviews. God is willing to hold Communion with me, at the Wells of Salvation; and I am going with Joy to draw water out of those Wells of Salvation.</HI> Child, Go, and God be with thee.</P>
<P>But I may now pass on to say, There are also <HI>Devotions</HI> of a more <HI>Private Cha∣racter,</HI> which our God has <HI>Appointed.</HI> And in these also <HI>Young Persons</HI> may and should have <HI>Communion</HI> with Him.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Devotions</HI> of a greater Privacy, The <HI>Religion of the Closet,</HI> calls for the greatest Regards imagina∣ble. Children, <HI>Behold, This House is a

Witness,</HI> how many Scores, and Hundreds of Times, the Young People here have had this <HI>Religion</HI> Pressed upon them. Ve∣rily, You are left altogether <HI>without A∣pology,</HI> if this <HI>Religion</HI> remain still Dis∣regarded with any of you. But I have now a New, and a Fresh, Occasion for the Pressing of it.</P>
<P>There has newly Dyed among us, an Hopeful, and a Pious <HI>Young Man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="inline">[<HI>Mr.</HI> Peter Oliver.]</NOTE> One Well <HI>Beloved</HI> in the Vicinity; who, a few Hours before he Dyed, Ex∣pressed these Desires to me; with Repe∣tition, and Importunity he Expressed them. <Q>Sir, I Pray you to Exhort mightily the <HI>Young People</HI> of this Place, that they would spend much Time in <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> and be much in the <HI>Religion of the Closet.</HI> It is what I have, thro' the Grace of God, my self not been a Stranger to, and I now Enjoy the <HI>Benefit</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> of it.</Q> Behold, I am this Day fulfilling the <HI>Will of the Dead;</HI> and inviting you to <HI>Ever∣lasting Life.</HI> If a Spirit Cloathed in <HI>Gar∣ments of Light</HI> might come down unto yet, from the <HI>Paradise</HI> of God, or, if the <HI>Angel,</HI> who was Charged, <HI>Run, Speak to the Young
<PB N="39" REF="001564_0042_0FB3AF91E7D31950"/>
Man,</HI> were this Day to speak unto you, what <HI>Exhortation</HI> could he bring of more Importance than this? Children, Be pre∣vailed withal, to Delay no longer; to Dally no longer; to make no more Excuses; But <HI>Set upon the Exercise of Secret Prayer immediately.</HI> Begin this Day to Retire for <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> and uphold the Exer∣cise all your Dayes. Chuse a fit <HI>Retire∣ment,</HI> like <HI>Nathanael,</HI> under his <HI>Fig-tree;</HI> and make it your daily Exercise to pour out your Supplications unto the Lord. You can't be at a Loss what you shall say. The <HI>CXIXth.</HI> Psalm; the whole Book of <HI>Psalms;</HI> all the whole <HI>Bible;</HI> the whole State of your own <HI>Soul,</HI> and of all that you have any <HI>Relation</HI> to, will afford you Ma∣terials for your Supplications.</P>
<P>How much do those <HI>Young Men</HI> Consult their own Welfare, who can say with him; Psal. CXIX. 47▪ <HI>I prevented the Dawning of the Morning, and I Cried!</HI> Oh! that ours, would go alone every Day; and first Con∣sult the Word of God, and then turn it into <HI>Cries</HI> unto Him! First find out the Wants and Cares and Loads of their own <HI>Souls,</HI> and put them into <HI>Cries</HI> unto the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="001564_0043_0FB3AF93B6566680"/><HI>Young People</HI> of both Sexes, you are all Concerned. We read concerning the Chariot of <HI>Solomon;</HI> Cant. III. 10. <HI>It was Paved with Love by the Daughters of Je∣rusalem.</HI> The <HI>Carpet</HI> laid under his Feet in his Chariot, was it seems, wrought with <HI>Lovely Figures,</HI> by the Ingenuity of these Young Gentlewomen. Oh! that ours would by Weeping Supplications to their Saviour, Kneeling on the Floor of their <HI>Secret Chambers,</HI> as it were lay a Well-wrought <HI>Carpet</HI> of their <HI>Love</HI> unto Him!</P>
<P>I Expect it of you, that you Consider Two or Three Questions on this Occasion.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> I. Is it not the <HI>Positive Command</HI> of your Saviour? Mat. VI. 6. <HI>Enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy Door, Pray to thy Father which is in Secret.</HI> And can he Challenge the Name of a <HI>Christian,</HI> who tramples on such a <HI>Positive Com∣mand</HI> of our Saviour? Or, What will such an one do, <HI>when God riseth up; when He visits,</HI> what shall such an one <HI>answer Him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> II. Are not the <HI>Blessings</HI> to be
<PB N="41" REF="001564_0044_0FB3AF95D450E1C8"/>
Gained by <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> well worth all your Labours for the Gaining of them? <HI>Reconciliation</HI> with God, and all the <HI>Bles∣sings of Goodness,</HI> bestow'd by the Infinite GOD, in <HI>Both Worlds,</HI> on those to whom He is <HI>Reconciled;</HI> Are not such Things worth a little <HI>Praying</HI> for?</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> III. When you are come to the <HI>Time</HI> of your <HI>Death,</HI> and the <HI>End</HI> of your <HI>Time,</HI> will the Time that you have spent in <HI>Secret Prayer</HI> be then Repented of? In your Last Hours, will you not then Wish, <HI>Oh! That I had spent fewer Hours in other Things, but many more, many more, in Praying to God, and Preparing for E∣ternity?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> IV. If after such Solemn and Frequent and Various Warnings as you have had, you will still continue <HI>Prayer∣less,</HI> and <HI>Fearless,</HI> may you not be justly <HI>Afraid,</HI> that the Holy GOD may by His <HI>Judgments</HI> upon you fulfil that Word; <HI>He that being often Reproved, hardeneth his Neck, shall be suddenly Destroyed, and that without Remedy?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="001564_0045_0FB3AF9725084150"/>And now, as the Angel siad, <HI>Run, Speak to this Young Man;</HI> I will so invert it; <HI>Young Man, Run, Run into thy Closet,</HI> and there Speak, and Pray, and Weep unto thy Saviour. Take up that Purpose therewithal; Psal. CXIX. 32. Lord, <HI>I will Run the way of thy Commandments, when thou shalt Enlarge my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Children, I Demand your <HI>Immediate Compliance.</HI> Your Duty has been set be∣fore you: The Demand is, That you <HI>Run</HI> into it. The Terms of it are, <HI>To Day, lest any of you be hardened through the Deceitfulness of Sin.</HI></P>
<P>I remember a Passage in Deut. VII. 11. <HI>The Commandments which I Command thee This Day.</HI> And I remember the Gloss which the Jewish Rabbi's have upon it; <HI>Hodie ea sum facunda, non-cras;</HI> Tis, Be∣cause they are <HI>Things to be done To Day;</HI> they must not be put off till, <HI>To morrow.</HI> And indeed it was a common saying a∣mong the Jews, a <HI>Saying of the Fathers</HI> a∣mong them, relating to the Resolutions of Piety; <HI>Si non Nunc, Quando?</HI> That is, <HI>If not Now, When?</HI> Alas, If you will not <HI>Now,</HI> it may be fear'd, it may be fear'd, you <HI>Never</HI> will.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="001564_0046_0FB3AF98AEC874A8"/>Our Saviour mentions it, as His <HI>Glory</HI> and His <HI>Delight;</HI> Psal. XVIII. 44. <HI>As soon as they Hear of me, they shall Obey me.</HI> Oh! Deny not unto a Dear Saviour, this <HI>Glory</HI> and this <HI>Delight;</HI> But now, <HI>As soon as you have Heard,</HI> that He Expects your Secret Addresses to Him, and Se∣rious Endeavours after Communion with Him, Immediately <HI>Obey</HI> Him. And, Oh! Lift up that Cry unto Him, <HI>Draw me, O my Saviour, and I shall Run unto thee!</HI></P>

<LG>
<L>LO the Young Tribes of <HI>Adam</HI> rise,</L>
<L>And thro' all Nature rove,</L>
<L>Fulfil the Wishes of their Eyes,</L>
<L>And taste the Joys they Love.</L>

<L>They give a loose to wild Desires;</L>
