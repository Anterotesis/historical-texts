<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THe Occasion &amp; Intention of the <HI>ES∣SAY</HI> now before us, is to be declar'd. The Writer thought it One part of <HI>Pa∣storal</HI> Diligence &amp; Vigilance, to allow a Proportion of Seasonable Visits, unto Such of his Flock, as he was informed from time to time, were near their <HI>Lying in;</HI> and therein to Address them with such <HI>Admo∣nitions of Piety</HI> as were most suited unto their <HI>present Condition,</HI> &amp; such as their <HI>Pregnant Condition</HI> must Reasonably A∣waken them to hearken to. It was part of <HI>Timothies</HI> charge; <HI>To intreat such, with all Purity.</HI> He remembred, who they were whom <HI>David follow'd,</HI> when he was a <HI>Shepherd;</HI> &amp; whom the Glorious LORD will <HI>Gently Lead,</HI> when He <HI>feeds His Flock.</HI> He Pondered the Tenderness, which the Great GOD our Saviour, has Expres∣sed for <HI>Women with Child,</HI> in many o∣ther Passages of His Bible, besides the <HI>XXI</HI> Chapter of <HI>Exodus.</HI> He was in <HI>Pain,</HI> to think, that a <HI>Sudden Destruction,</HI> &amp; a fearful and endless One, should <HI>come as
<PB REF="001463_0003_0FB34B15E4EC06C0"/>
Travail upon a Woman with Child,</HI> up∣on any who <HI>draw near a Time of Travail.</HI> He found his Addresses Acceptable and Serviceable. At length, he resolved up∣on a further Method, of more Effectually coming at many, whom he cannot have Op∣portunities Personally to Speak unto. He reads, <HI>Exod. I. 21. The MIDWIVES <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eared God.</HI> It is to be hoped, They gene∣rally do so. He therefore Publishes this <HI>ESSAY,</HI> and furnishes the Pious <HI>Midwives</HI> with Some Numbers thereof, that they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end or Give, the Little BOOK, unto those, by whom they know an <HI>Hour of Travail and Trouble</HI> to be Expected. Certainly the <HI>Hand∣maids of the Lord,</HI> will receive this as a <HI>Messenger</HI> from HIM unto them! When the Holy <HI>ELIZABETH</HI> Retired for so many <HI>Months,</HI> into the <HI>Hilly Country,</HI> you may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stly conceive, that she was Employ'd in Ex∣ercises of the same Tenour and Tendency with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch as are here Prescribed. None but Filthy and Hard. <HI>Scoffers,</HI> will cast Contempt on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er of Prescriptions, that are so adapted unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the most <HI>Frequent,</HI> and yet One of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e most <HI>Solemn,</HI> Occasions in the World.</P>

<HEAD>THE Duties and the Supports OF One Expecting an Hour of <HI>Travail.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN Address is now to be made unto an <HI>Handmaid</HI> of the LORD, who <HI>Expect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> e're long the arrival of a Time, when her <HI>Loins</HI> will be <HI>filled with Pain, Pangs will take hold of her, the Pangs of a Woman, which travail∣eth.</HI> 'Tis <HI>New,</HI> Sure, if ever, a Time, wherein it may be Expected, that she will hearken to the Counsils of God▪ <HI>This,</HI> if any, is the Time, wherein the Methods and Motions of Divine Grace, will <HI>find her;</HI> And if ever you will <HI>hear the Voice of God</HI> at all, <HI>To Day you will hear His Voice.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="001463_0005_0FB34B1970A54EE0"/>The Hazards and Hardships under∣gone by the <HI>Travailing</HI> Daughters of <HI>Eve,</HI> make a Considerable Article of the <HI>Curse,</HI> which the <HI>Transgression</HI> where-into she was <HI>Deceived,</HI> has brought upon the mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erable World. But our Great Redee∣mer has procured this Grace from God, into the <HI>Daughters of Zion,</HI> that the <HI>Curse</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turn'd into a <HI>Blessing.</HI> The Approach of their <HI>Travails,</HI> proves to them an Oc∣casion and an Excitement for those Ex∣ercises of <HI>Piety,</HI> that Secure to them, and prepare them for, Eternal <HI>Blessedness;</HI> and they may Say, <HI>Tis Good for me that I have been Afflicted.</HI> Unto this it is very such owing, that tho' thro' the Evident providence of God watching over Hu∣mane Affairs, there is pretty near an equal Number of <HI>Males</HI> &amp; <HI>Females</HI> born, at the Number of the <HI>Males</HI> who are apparently <HI>Pious,</HI> and partakers of a <HI>New <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rth,</HI> is not so great as that of the <HI>Fe∣males.</HI> Indeed, it will argue a wonder∣ful Stupidity of Soul, and Obstinacy in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, if the Dangers and Sorrows where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you are now obnoxious, do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake you Serious, and cause you Seri∣ously
<PB N="3" REF="001463_0006_0FB34B1A62210B98"/>
to Consider on your Condition, and bring you to a Considerate, Sollici∣tous, Effectual Preparation for Eternity: if you are not now ready to hear the <HI>Admonitions of God your Saviour.</HI> You are now Addressed, with some Advice from Heaven, in hopes, that <HI>This is the Time,</HI> for you to be more than eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Made Wise unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>And the first thing, to be propounded unto you, is; That you do not indulge an indecent <HI>Impatience</HI> or <HI>Discontent,</HI> at the State, which you find ordered for you. It will be a very blameable Inde∣cency and Indiscretion in you, to be <HI>Dissatisfyed</HI> at your State of <HI>Pregnancy.</HI> Froward Pangs of <HI>Dissatisfaction,</HI> har∣boured, and humoured, in you, because you See that <HI>in Sorrow you are to bring forth Children,</HI> may displease Heaven, and bring yet more <HI>Sorrow</HI> upon you. It will indeed look too <HI>Unnatural</HI> in you, to complain of a State, whereinto the <HI>Laws of Nature</HI> established by God, have brought you. The will of the Great God, has been declared in these Terms, 1 Tim. V. 14. <HI>I will that the Younger Wo∣men,
<PB REF="001463_0007_0FB34B1C0902D6C8"/>
Marry, bear Children.</HI> When you find that a Conception has brought you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto <HI>Child-bearing</HI> circumstances, Let your Submission to the <HI>Will</HI> of God there∣in, be full of Satisfaction, and Resigna∣tion. Let this Thought now carry you Cheerfully thro' all the <HI>Uneasiness,</HI> which is now become Unavoidable: <HI>Great GOD; I am thine; And I am willing to be, all that thou wilt have me to be!</HI> Indeed, it is to be esteemed a <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, that One principal End of <HI>Marriage,</HI> is thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar in an <HI>Honourable way</HI> of being answe∣red with you. It was acknowledged as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Mercy, in the Old Time, by the Holy Wo∣men, who trusted in God.</HI> They Look'd on themselves as <HI>Mercifully Visited of God,</HI> when they had conceived. It was en∣tertained, as a Gracious <HI>Promise</HI> of God unto His People, <HI>That they should have an Offspring.</HI> It was esteemed, The <HI>taking away of a Reproach. Barrenness</HI> was Threa∣tened, and Bewayled, as a <HI>Calamity:</HI> A Punishment for a <HI>Michol.</HI> The Saints made it a frequent Petition in their Prayers, That <HI>God would bestow Children upon them.</HI> I shall Speak but in a Lan∣guage
<PB N="5" REF="001463_0008_0FB34B1D6454C800"/>
which your Sex of Old would have allow'd of, if I now tell you; <HI>That God has Look'd upon His Handmaid, and Re∣membred her, and not forgotten her, but given her to Conceive.</HI> For I must go on to tell you, That upon your giving up your self unto the Lord, Your Children become the <HI>Children of God. They are my Children,</HI> Saith your God: It is a <HI>Child of God,</HI> that you have now within you: What a Consolation! 'Tis a Subject and a Ser∣vant of a Glorious CHRIST, whose <HI>Bones</HI> are now <HI>growing in the Womb, of her that is with Child;</HI> It is, a <HI>Member</HI> of His Mystical Body, which is now <HI>Shaping in Secret,</HI> and <HI>Curiously to be wrought.</HI> An Ex∣cellent Gentlewoman, who had a Strong presage, which prov'd a True One, of her <HI>Dying</HI> by her Travail, yet you read in her <HI>Legacy</HI> Written for her unborn Child, her <HI>Desire of God, that she might be a Mother to One of His Children.</HI> I add, You are to bring forth a Creature of Excellent Faculties; and One from whom the Lord will have glory for Eter∣nal Ages. You don't know, what an Instrument of Good this Child may
<PB REF="001463_0009_0FB34B1F1FF10850"/>
prove in the World. As mean a <HI>Mother</HI> as you, has brought forth an <HI>Hero.</HI> Nor do you know, what a <HI>Possession,</HI> what an <HI>Enjoyment,</HI> this Child may prove unto <HI>You</HI> particularly. Who can foresee, how far, <HI>This Same shall comfort you!</HI> This is the first <HI>Lessen of Piety,</HI> to be urged upon you: Whatever <HI>Sickness</HI> you now labour under, be not <HI>Sick</HI> of your present State. Rebuke, Repress, Restrain, all Disquiet of Mind; <HI>Why art thou cast down, O my Soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God!</HI> It is all for the best. O <HI>Builder up</HI> of the Church of God in the World; Say, and Pray, <HI>O my God, Help me always to like the State, wherein thou performest the thing, that is appointed for me.</HI></P>
<P>But now, the <HI>Next</HI> thing to be pro∣pounded, is; That you hasten into a State of <HI>Safety</HI> for <HI>Eternity:</HI> Yea, This is the very <HI>First</HI> Thing that you have to do, upon your being Sensible of a <HI>Conception.</HI> For ought you know, your <HI>Death</HI> has entred into you, and you may have con∣ceived That which determines but about Nine Months more at the most, for you
<PB N="7" REF="001463_0010_0FB34B2064BCB960"/>
to Live in the World. <HI>Preparation for Death</HI> is that Most Reasonable and Most Seasonable thing to which you must now Apply your self. It will do you <HI>no Hurt.</HI> You will Dy not One Mi∣nute the Sooner for it. And being <HI>Fit to Dy,</HI> you will be but the more <HI>Fit to Live.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Daughter of Sorrows;</HI> Will you give a Great and Just Attention? <HI>Set your Heart</HI> unto these things; They are <HI>not Vain Things;</HI> Your Everlasting <HI>Life</HI> is concer∣ned in them.</P>
<P>You must in the first Place be very sensible, That Except you are <HI>Born again,</HI> it had been <HI>Good for you that you had never been born;</HI> Except you have Experience of a true <HI>Conversion</HI> to God, you unavoi∣dably <HI>Perish.</HI> The <HI>Sorrows</HI> of <HI>Child-birth,</HI> will be to you, but the <HI>Beginning of Sor∣rows,</HI> and of such as know no <HI>End.</HI> Think with your self, <HI>If the Pains of my Travail, which I hope, will be quickly over, were to last a thousand years, how wretched, Oh! how wretched were I! And yet, if my Peace be not made with the Holy God, I may fear to be more terribly dealt withal! Oh! Tis a

fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God!</HI> Some Women that have been in <HI>Horror of Conscience,</HI> have declared, that all the Anguish of bringing more than Seven Children into the World has been much more tolerable, than that hor∣rible Anguish of their Mind. How Intole∣rable then, Oh! how Insupportable, will be the Anguish, in the Conscience of a Sinner, banished from God, fearfully Scorched and Tortur'd with Impressions from the Wrath of God; and cast into a <HI>Place of Torments,</HI> into the <HI>Place of Dragons!</HI> Let the Thought of this, mightily Quick∣en and Hasten your <HI>Flight from the Wrath to come.</HI> In this Flight you must first, Acknowledge; <HI>O Holy Lord, I am not Able to Turn unto thee.</HI> You must also Acknow∣ledge; <HI>O Holy Lord, I am not Worthy, that thou shouldest help me to Turn.</HI> Without this <HI>Humiliation,</HI> you will never <HI>Turn.</HI> But then, go on with proper Acknow∣ledgments of <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> to beg of the Gracious Lord; <HI>O Glorious One, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned.</HI> Proceed now, and Ponder, on your Sinful and Woful circumstances before the Lord;
<PB N="9" REF="001463_0012_0FB34B24E09F93E8"/>
Ponder, and Confess; <HI>O Great God, I have Sinned, and Perverted that which is Right! I have Sinned, and I have done very foolishly!</HI> Examine your past Life; Reflect on all the Errors and Follies of your Life. Look back with Bitterness of Soul, upon every Sin, that you can charge your self with∣al; Every Violation of the <HI>Ten Command∣ments,</HI> on each of which you should make a Pause; Every Miscarriage, in every <HI>Condition,</HI> in every <HI>Relation,</HI> in every <HI>Em∣ployment.</HI> Be as much afraid of Leaving any Sin unconfessed, as you would be of having the <HI>After-birth left in you,</HI> after your Travail. And because you have not <HI>Ob∣served,</HI> and have not <HI>Remembred</HI> Thousands of your Sins, bewail this <HI>Inadvertency</HI> also, as not the least of your Sins. With Asto∣nishment cry out, <HI>O Holy God, I am a most Polluted Creature! My Life has been a very course of Sin. Innumerable Evils compass me about; My Sins, my Sins are Numberless. My Heart fails me, when I think upon them!</HI> At the same time, Go up as far as the <HI>Origi∣nal Sin,</HI> which is the <HI>Fountain</HI> of all your Sins. The Terrors of <HI>Child-bearing</HI> which are now upon you, do very properly lead

you to bewail your Share in the <HI>Sin of your First Parents;</HI> and to bewail with Bitter Tears, that <HI>Corrupt Nature,</HI> which by a Derivation from your <HI>Next Parents</HI> you brought into the World with you. Think, <HI>Lord, I was conceived in Sin; I was born a Leper; and my poor Child will be so too!</HI> But herewithal, you must very deeply affect your self, with the horrid and heinous Evil, which there is in every Sin. Afflict yourself, with it; <HI>What have I done? O Great God, How wickedly have I Deny'd thee, and Defy'd thee, and Despised the Blood of my Saviour, and Hearkened unto Sa∣tan before my Saviour, and chose Earth and Hell, before the Joyes of Heaven, as often as I have Sinned against thee! I have been a Fool that have made Light of Sin. This, This has been an heavy Aggravation of all my Sin.</HI> Go on then to an amazing View of the Deplorable State into which you are fal∣len by your Sin. Think with Amaze∣ment; <Q>Wo is unto me, that I have Sin∣ned! The Infinite God is angry with me; And who knows the Power of His Anger! The Devil demands me as his Captive; I am a Prey to the Terrible

one. Sin Tyrannizes over me; I am held in chains of Darkness. If I dy, as I am, what will become of me! Who can dwell in those Everlasting Burn∣ings, which will be the Doom of those who dy unpardoned! O Wretched one that I am; who shall deliver me!</Q> Being brought into the <HI>Contrition</HI> of this Distress; NOW, Behold the admirable SAVIOUR provided for you; The JE∣SUS, who is <HI>God Manifest in Flesh,</HI> God and Man in One Person: The <HI>Saviour,</HI> who is <HI>Able to Save you unto the Uttermost;</HI> the <HI>Saviour</HI> who bids you <HI>Look unto Him and be Saved.</HI> Oh! Take the Encourage∣ment of that Sweet Word, Joh. VI. 37. <HI>Him that comes unto me I will in no Wise cast out.</HI> Cry to Him, <HI>O my dear Saviour, Draw me to thee; Oh! make me thine, and Save me.</HI> Let no Apprehension of your own <HI>Vileness</HI> make you despair to find Accep∣tance with Him; Nor let any Good in your selves Embolden your Hope &amp; Plea, that you may be Accepted. Come un∣der no Recommendation, but that of your own dreadful <HI>Necessity,</HI> and <HI>Confusion,</HI> and the <HI>Triumphs of Grace,</HI> which arise from

Yield the consent of a Conquered Soul; <Q>O Spirit of the Holy One; I am willing, Oh! do thou make me willing, that thou come and Renew me in the Spi∣rit of my Mind; make me a New Creature; Produce the Holy &amp; Love∣ly Image of God upon me.

Tables;</HI> and pass a <HI>Judgment</HI> on your selves according to the Discoveries which that <HI>Glass</HI> will give you of your self. That word is of a Vast Importance; 1 Cor.

Think, as in Ezr. 9.13, 14. <HI>Seeing thou, O my God, hast given me such a Deliverance as this▪ Should▪ again break thy Commandments, wouldest thou not be Angry with me, till thou hast consume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

me?</HI> But then, Go on to think, <HI>What</HI> you will do, that you may maintain more Communion with God, in the <HI>Re∣ligion of the Closet:</HI> Think, <HI>What</HI> you will do, that you may be a greater Blessing in your Family, and to your several Re∣latives: Think, <HI>What</HI> you will do in A∣bating of your Superfluities, that you may Employ the more upon Pious Uses; Perhaps, to Clothe poor Widows, like another <HI>Darcas.</HI> Beg the Help of the Divine Grace, that you may Do such Things; and Glorify your Saviour, with a <HI>Reasonable Service.</HI></P>
<P>One of the First Things to be done, is to Give up your <HI>New-born Child</HI> unto the Lord, in His Holy <HI>Baptism.</HI> Thus rescue the Child, from the <HI>Great Red Dra∣gon,</HI> who is watching to Devour it. Let the <HI>Child</HI> be either <HI>Male</HI> or <HI>Female,</HI> this is a matter to be left entirely unto the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the Glorious GOD. Either of them, if it be a <HI>Perfect Child,</HI> brings ten Thousand Mercies with it. And, if it may be a <HI>Child</HI> of God the Father, a <HI>Sub∣ject</HI> of God the Son, a <HI>Temple</HI> of God the Spirit, think, <HI>This is enough; Lord, I have

brought One of thy Children into the World.</HI></P>
<P>As a Declaration of this Intention in you, Send the Child abroad, unto the Congregation of the Faithful, where it shall be <HI>Washed,</HI> and <HI>Blessed</HI> in the Name of the Glorious One, and laid under E∣verlasting <HI>Bonds</HI> to be the Lords. But at the same time, Look on your self as laid under <HI>Bonds,</HI> to bring up the Child for Him; and <HI>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>You will <HI>Suckle your Infant your Self</HI> if you can; Be not such an <HI>Ostrich</HI> as to Decline it, meerly because you would be One of the <HI>Careless Women, Living at Ease.</HI> Of such we read, They are <HI>Dead while they Live.</HI> But if you have the Calamity of <HI>Dry Breasts;</HI> or your Health will not permit you to <HI>Give Suck;</HI> Entertain it with Submission to the will of God; but as a <HI>Calamity.</HI></P>
<P>Finally; Being well Recovered, you will Rejoyce in your Fresh Opportunities to Repair unto the Worship of God in His <HI>Congregations.</HI> Thither you will now Repair with such Dispositions as those;

[Psal. CXVI. 16, 17, 18.] <HI>O Lord, Truly I am thy Handmaid, I am thy Handmaid; Thou hast Loosed my Bonds. I will offer to thee, the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord. I will pay my Vows unto the Lord, now in the Presence of all His People.</HI></P>
