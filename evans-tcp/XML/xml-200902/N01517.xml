<P>IN a tender <HI>Sympathy</HI> with You, as becomes my <HI>Pastoral Relation</HI> and that <HI>particular Friendship</HI> you favour me with on the best Accounts, I was naturally led into the following ME∣DITATION, upon the Death of your Ex∣cellent &amp; Gracious <HI>Consort.</HI> As GOD has bless'd you with many <HI>Lovely Children</HI> by Her, so few MOTHERS have better an∣swer'd the Character of <HI>Solomons rare &amp; In∣valuable Vertuous Woman,</HI> or more Merited <HI>that her Children should rise up &amp; call Her Blessed</HI> I know how dear her <HI>Memory</HI> will ever be unto you, nor <HI>need you Praise</HI> her to them that know her.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PROVERBS XXXI. 28.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Her Children arise up, and call her blessed; her Husband also, and he praiseth her.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS <HI>Chapter</HI> is an <HI>Appendix</HI> to the <HI>Proverbs of Solomon.</HI> They are the <HI>Words of King Lemuel, the Prophecy that his Mother taught him. Inter∣preters</HI> are generally of Opinion, that <HI>Le∣muel</HI> is no other than <HI>Solomon</HI> himself. At least, like <HI>Solomon,</HI> he was a Wise and Re∣ligious <HI>King,</HI> under the Inspiration and Di∣rection of GOD in what is here wrote.
<PB N="2" REF="001803_0006_0FB843DB19C2DD28"/>He had likewise a Religious and Wise <HI>Mo∣ther,</HI> who took great Care to Instruct and Charge Him from GOD; as <HI>Solomon</HI> was <HI>tender and Only-beloved in the sight of his Mother.</HI> The Gracious Mother of <HI>Lemuel</HI> was <HI>Inspir'd of GOD</HI> in these Admonitions which She gave to her <HI>Son;</HI> and so has the Honour to stand on Record here as a <HI>Pro∣phetess</HI> as well as a <HI>Princess.</HI> She first In∣structs the <HI>Prince</HI> her Son in <HI>his Duty,</HI> how to behave himself as becomes his high Place and <HI>Dignity;</HI> and then she Instructs her <HI>Dau'ters</HI> what they should be; more especi∣ally in the Relation of <HI>Wives.</HI> Or it may be she gave this <HI>Description</HI> of a VERTU∣OUS WOMAN to the <HI>Prince</HI> her Son, as a <HI>Direction to him in the Choice of a Wise.</HI></P>
<P>SO then a <HI>Wise Inspired WOMAN</HI> is our <HI>Teacher</HI> to Day, and her <HI>happy Son</HI> pre∣serves her Wise Sayings in <HI>Writing.</HI> Her <HI>Instructions</HI> will be the more Acceptable and Powerful I hope to her Sex, and we <HI>all</HI> must with equal Reverence hear the HOLY GHOST speaking to us, as when His In∣spirations rested on the <HI>Holy Men of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IN short, this <HI>Holy Mother,</HI>
<LIST>
<PB N="3" REF="001803_0007_0FB843DCDCB9C280"/>
<ITEM>1. DECLARES the <HI>Price and Rarity</HI> of the Vertuous Woman, whom she describes, <HI>v.</HI> 10.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. SHE gives her <HI>Character</HI> in many Par∣ticulars, in the following Verses; her Chastity and Modesty, Diligence and Fru∣gality, Discretion and Prudence, and in all her Piety and Conscientiousness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. SHE tells the <HI>Felicities of this Excel∣lent Person;</HI> what a <HI>Blessing</HI> she is to her <HI>Husband,</HI> what a <HI>Confidence</HI> he puts in her; how she does him <HI>Honour,</HI> and is <HI>Valued</HI> and Esteemed by him: And in particular in the Words of my <HI>Text,</HI> How her <HI>Children rise up and call her Blessed,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>IT is <HI>supposed</HI> here, that she have a <HI>Hus∣band,</HI> and have <HI>Children.</HI> It is a Gracious <HI>Wife</HI> &amp; a <HI>Mother in Israel,</HI> that is spoken of. For there may be the <HI>same</HI> Excellent Wo∣men in <HI>neither</HI> of these Relations, and equal∣ly is she then Accepted of GOD, and <HI>Vene∣rable</HI> among His People.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, It is <HI>supposed,</HI> that both the Husband and the Children be in some measure <HI>Good</HI> as she is. She will not else
<PB N="4" REF="001803_0008_0FB843DE2A889C60"/>be so <HI>Blessed</HI> in their Eyes; nor <HI>Praised</HI> by them for her Piety and Excellencies. Tho' indeed the <HI>Wicked</HI> are often forc'd to Praise and call them Blessed, whom they do not Imitate and learn of.</P>
<P>BUT let us suppose the <HI>best</HI> here; I mean that the <HI>whole Family</HI> be Wise and Vertu∣ous: Let us suppose the <HI>Vertuous Wife</HI> hap∣py in a <HI>Gracious and Wise Husband,</HI> that knows how to Prize and Praise her; and happy in Wise and Pious <HI>Children,</HI> who un∣derstand the Blessing they have, or have had, in such a <HI>Mother.</HI> And that <HI>they</HI> may the better do so, who are blessed with such a <HI>Relative,</HI> I will enlarge a little in opening the several <HI>Parts of the Text.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>HER Children rise up.</HI> And this may signify and import,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>THE Reverence that her Children bear to her, &amp; are ever ready to express in all their Carriage towards her, in all their Deportment and Behaviour in her Presence, in all their Words and Actions before her.</HI> They Ho∣nour her in their Hearts, and do her Honour
<PB N="5" REF="001803_0009_0FB843DFA6B56C80"/>always; such as her <HI>Superiour</HI> Relation to them, her <HI>Age,</HI> her <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Gravity,</HI> her <HI>Authority</HI> by Nature, her <HI>Benefits</HI> to them, and all her <HI>Persenal Excellencies</HI> do com∣mand from them. They do this from <HI>Incli∣nation</HI> and Love, and also from <HI>Principle</HI> and a sense of Duty. Even <HI>Nature</HI> teaches them, and the <HI>Law</HI> of God requires it of them, for it is the <HI>first Commandment with Promise, Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</HI> In Obe∣dience therefore unto GOD, Pious Chil∣dren will Reverence and <HI>rise up</HI> before their Parents, and it is <HI>the least external Act of Fi∣lial Respect,</HI> in the <HI>Letter</HI> of the <HI>Text,</HI> that Children can think due unto their Parents. They will <HI>rise up</HI> when their Parents come into the Room where they are, to <HI>bow down</HI> to them. They will <HI>rise up</HI> before them when they speak, to <HI>hear their Wisdom,</HI> to receive their <HI>Will,</HI> and in order to the doing what they require or direct. Especially Parents that are <HI>Exemplary</HI> for Wisdom, Pi∣ety, and the good Government of their Housholds, are <HI>worthy of double Honours. Solomon,</HI> tho' he were a <HI>King,</HI> yet when his
<PB N="6" REF="001803_0010_0FB843E137D6FF88"/><HI>Mother</HI> came into his Presence, <HI>he rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down upon his Throne, and caused a seat to be set for the Kings Mother, and she sat on his right hand,</HI> 1 Kings 2.19. Be we <HI>grown up,</HI> and <HI>grown Great,</HI> yet we are never <HI>too big</HI> to <HI>rise up</HI> and <HI>bow down</HI> to our <HI>Parents</HI> And not only do we at Mens Estate owe this unto our <HI>Fathers,</HI> if they are yet alive, but also to our <HI>Aged Mothers;</HI> remembring how they have <HI>born us</HI> in the Womb and from the Womb, their many <HI>Tender Cares</HI> for us, and <HI>Good Offices</HI> to us from our Infancy. He is a <HI>Foolish Son</HI> (says <HI>Solomon</HI>) <HI>that de∣spiseth his Mother:</HI> And in the Wisdom of GOD he charges us not to <HI>despise her when she is Old;</HI> which too many <HI>scornful and inso∣lent Young People</HI> are apt to do; they make light of what the <HI>Old Woman</HI> says, tho' she warns them in the Wisdom of GOD, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.22. We are bid to <HI>rise up before the hoary Head, &amp; to honour the Face of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man.</HI> Much more shou'd we do this to our <HI>Parents in their Age.</HI> But this is the <HI>first Sense,</HI> her Children rise up <HI>in Reverence in her Presence.</HI></ITEM>

2. <HI>HER Children rise,</HI> i. e. <HI>Grow up in her sight;</HI> say some. Her Reward, her Joy and her Crown She sees them as <HI>Olive Plants</HI> growing round her Table and her House. It may be she is so happy as to have her <HI>Quiver</HI> full of them; and they are rising up about her to be her <HI>Defence</HI> in times to come, as well as her <HI>present Ornament &amp; Guard,</HI> that she may <HI>speak even with the Enemy in the Gate,</HI> by them Fighting for her. Or it may be she sees her Childrens Children, and <HI>Peace upon Israel.</HI> Her Sons and her Sons Sons add to the Numbers of <HI>Israel</HI> and their Valiant Men, which are the Security and Safeguard of the Nation. Her Sons are as <HI>Plants grown up in their Touth, her Daughters as corner Stones, polished after the similitude of a Palace.</HI> <Q>Plants, not <HI>Weeds.</HI> Grown up, not <HI>Withered</HI> and <HI>Blasted,</HI> but likely to bring forth Fruit in their Day. Families are <HI>Connected</HI> also by the Daugh∣ters, as the parts of a <HI>fine Building</HI> are by the <HI>Corner Stones:</HI> And as the <HI>Polished Stones of a Palace,</HI> so are they in <HI>the Families united by them,</HI> when they are Graceful and Beauteous in Body &amp; Mind.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="8" REF="001803_0012_0FB843E65EA6B9B8"/>
3. <HI>HER Children rise up in her place, &amp; fill it after her Decease.</HI> The Excellent Mother <HI>Dies</HI> it may be as they are <HI>Growing up,</HI> but her Children, and especially her <HI>Daughters,</HI> partaking of her Excellent Spirit soon <HI>come to Shine</HI> as she once did. The Gracious Parent <HI>Revives</HI> in her Offspring; her <HI>Graces</HI> are seen in them, they tread in her <HI>Steps,</HI> exhibit her <HI>Vertues,</HI> as the <HI>Branches agree unto the Stock.</HI> They are Grave and Ver∣tuous, Meek and Humble, Benevolent and Courteous, Devout and Gracious, full of all Goodness; so as to <HI>bring the Deceased Mother to the Minds</HI> of them that knew her, and now see the Chaste Conversation of her Daughters. Children <HI>worthy</HI> of such a Pa∣rent, and worthy to bear her Name, and fill up her Place; <HI>whose Daughters they are so long as they do well;</HI> but if otherwise, no Bo∣dy would drink that they came of her, or ever belong'd to her. The <HI>Mother will ne∣ver Die,</HI> we say, so long as these live; they are the <HI>living Monument</HI> that bear the <HI>In∣scription</HI> of her Vertues and Praises: They <HI>Transcribe</HI> them in their own Lives.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="9" REF="001803_0013_0FB843E7E4077ED8"/>
4. <HI>HER Children rise up—,</HI> It notes, (says one and another of our <HI>Expositors</HI>) <HI>that they set themselves purposely &amp; industri∣ously to what follows;</HI> i. e. <HI>To Praise &amp; Bless her.</HI> They <HI>Seriously apply themselves</HI> to the Work of setting forth her Praises, and doing her Honour. So Men <HI>rise up,</HI> when they <HI>set</HI> themselves about any Work which they are <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Earnest upon.</HI> The Wise Children of Excellent Parents shou'd have their Hearts Intent and Earnest upon this, to do Honour to their Names, and shew forth their Vertues. This is a good and pleasant Work which they are always ready to <HI>rise up &amp; engage in.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>BUT so much for the <HI>first thing; Her Children rise up—.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. IT follows, <HI>And call her Blessed.</HI> They have been the constant <HI>Eye witnesses</HI> of her whole Carriage; they have seen her Exem∣plary life, her <HI>personal Excellencies,</HI> and hap∣pily experienced her <HI>Relative Goodness</HI> in a thousand Instances; and are under so many <HI>Obligations</HI> to call her Blessed.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001803_0014_0FB843E976BB6210"/>
<HI>THERE is a Generation indeed that cur∣seth their Father, &amp; doth not bless their Mo∣ther,</HI> Prov. 30.11. But it is not this <HI>sordid, graceless, profane</HI> and <HI>unnatural Crew,</HI> that I have now to do with; save only as they stand <HI>condemned</HI> &amp; <HI>detected</HI> by our <HI>Doctrine.</HI> And by the way Observe, that the Generation that <HI>do not bless their Mother,</HI> are little better, if not the very same, with them that <HI>curse their Father.</HI> Let none of us be of this <HI>Seed of the Serpent,</HI> this <HI>Generation of Vipers.</HI> How unlike they are the Vertuous Children of the Vertuous Woman in our Text? <HI>Her Children rise up &amp; call her Blessed.</HI></P>
<P>THAt is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>SUCH is the Inward Esteem, Affection &amp; Gratitude of their Souls towards her, that they inwardly &amp; secrely bless her in their hearts, as often as they see her or think of her.</HI> As often as they rise up in her Presence, this is the language of their hearts concerning her and toward her. O what a blessed Wo∣man is She <HI>in her Self!</HI> (says their Judici∣ous Esteem) What a blessing has She been <HI>to us!</HI> What a blessing in the <HI>World!</HI> How
<PB N="11" REF="001803_0015_0FB843EB06A8FC90"/>much are we and others <HI>the better</HI> for her! How happy her <HI>Family,</HI> how happy her <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Nei'bours</HI> in her! and how hap∣py She in her self in being what She is Were you <HI>within</HI> her gracious Children you would see and hear this in their retired tho'ts and real sentiments; <HI>Lord, what a Blessing have we in such a Parent!</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>WHEN ever they Speak of her, it is with high Reverence &amp; Honour.</HI> In so many <HI>Words</HI> they call her Blessed. They do not <HI>Name</HI> her but with the <HI>utmost respect.</HI> When they have occasion to commend her <HI>behind her back,</HI> then they utter their High Opinion and Esteem of her. They <HI>can't bear</HI> that any should Speak evil of her. It is to them as if one <HI>Spake against the Light,</HI> or threw dirt in their <HI>Eyes,</HI> and next to the Blaspheming God in their hearing. With the Mouth bless we God, and with the Mouth we bless Men; and some are so Excellent Persons that when the Eye sees'em and the Ear hears them, the Mouth must needs bless them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>THEIR whole Deportment before &amp; to∣ward Her speak the Sentiments of their hearts
<PB N="12" REF="001803_0016_0FB843ECED889208"/>concerning her.</HI> And this is more than <HI>all words.</HI> You may see it in their <HI>Eyes,</HI> which bear wit∣ness to her. There the Esteem of the Soul <HI>sits visible</HI> &amp; shines out. You may see by their whole Carriage and Behaviour what their <HI>Veneration</HI> is: with what delight they hear her Speak, with what Pleasure they re∣ceive her Will; how they listen to her Wis∣dom, how they submit reverently to her rebukes, with what Joy they see her smile on them. So when <HI>Job went to the Gate thro' the City, when he prepared his Seat in the Street, the young men-saw him &amp; hid them∣selves, the aged arose &amp; stood up; the Princes refrained Talking, &amp; the Nobles held their peace: Unto him they gave ear &amp; waited, &amp; kept silence at his counsel; if he laughed on'em they believed it not,</HI> &amp;c. That is to say, They did by every <HI>external sign</HI> Express the high Reverence which in their Souls they bare him. And this was indeed <HI>to bear wit∣ness to him,</HI> and more than in <HI>words</HI> to call him blessed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. HER Children rise up &amp; call her Bles∣sed, <HI>It may mean that they are Themselves her
<PB N="13" REF="001803_0017_0FB843EF0CC02518"/>best Praise &amp; Commendation.</HI> Their <HI>own</HI> Ver∣tues, and verrous Deeds praise their Pa∣rent. Their <HI>Good Manners,</HI> their good <HI>Breed∣ing,</HI> their Modesty and Humility, Sobriety, Charity &amp; Godliness; Their <HI>good Conversa∣tion in Christ,</HI> as becomes the Gospel; these declare the <HI>Pains she took in their Education,</HI> the <HI>Example</HI> she gave them, the <HI>Instructions</HI> and <HI>Charges</HI> they had from her, her <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Vows</HI> for them. See the blessed <HI>Fruit</HI> of her Fidelity, the <HI>Travel</HI> of her Soul for theirs, to see Christ formed in them! So when a <HI>Woman</HI> saw the Grace of God in our SAVIOUR, and heard his Divine Discour∣ses, <HI>she blessed the Womb that bare him, and the Paps that he had sucked.</HI> And blessed in∣deed the Womb and the Breasts are, where in a good Sense <HI>Partus sequitur ventrem,</HI> and the Excellent Children, do but exhibit the Vertues and Graces of a good Mother. <HI>Blessed the Mother</HI> that bears and brings up Children for Christ, and they live to Him as she has taught them. So the Graces of Children do sometimes call to our Minds the Graces of Parents even after their De∣cease;
<PB N="14" REF="001803_0018_0FB843F13664F8F8"/>2 Tim. 1.5. <HI>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned Faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy Grandmother Lois, and in thy Mother Eunice, and I am perswaded that in thee also.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>HER Children rise up &amp; bless God for her.</HI> In their <HI>Secret Devotions</HI> they do so daily, and in the <HI>Family Prayers,</HI> and often in a Day may they do so in their Secret <HI>Ejaculations,</HI> and the upliftings of their Soul to God, in Company or out of Company, in the Parents Presence and while she is Speaking, or otherwise. A Parent is to her Children <HI>what God makes her to be;</HI> and a Gracious Parent is a singular Gift and Blessing of God unto a Family of Children; wherefore to be sure every Gracious Child will Bless and Praise God for such a Parent; and <HI>in doing that they call her Blessed.</HI> What we bless God for, owning it to have been a Blessing to us, we do abundantly <HI>call Blessed.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>HER Children ever Pray for her; bless her, and ask the Blessings of Heaven on her.</HI> So she is ever Blessing her Children, <HI>in her
<PB N="15" REF="001803_0019_0FB843F313A9D428"/>Prayers for them;</HI> in which she has remem∣brance of them Day and Night, without ceasing. And thus <HI>Children may bless their Parents,</HI> and Inferiours their Superiors, by <HI>Praying</HI> for them, as well as <HI>Blessing God</HI> for them. For <HI>have we not all one Father? And has not one God created us?</HI> And are not <HI>all Souls</HI> alike His? The Souls of Pa∣rents and the Souls of Children? And as Parents can't do their Duty to their Chil∣dren without commending them to the Grace and Blessing of God in their Daily Prayers, as <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>David</HI> bless'd their Houses; So neither can Children <HI>render the Love and Reverence</HI> due to their Parents, without Praying for them Daily. For Pa∣rents do as much <HI>need</HI> God's Blessing on them as their Children do; and Children therefore <HI>ought</HI> to implore God's Blessing on their Father and Mother, as much as Pa∣rents ought to ask it for their Children. And that Child <HI>never will</HI> Devoutly and a∣right rise up and call his Parent Blessed, who <HI>does not Beg</HI> of God in Solemn Prayer, that HE would bless them: <HI>Whose Blessing it is that makes us Blessings.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="16" REF="001803_0020_0FB843F41D908310"/>
7. <HI>THE Memory of the Gracious Mother is Blessed with her Children after her Decease.</HI> They call her Blessed after she is <HI>Dead. The Memory of the Just is Blessed,</HI> Prov. 107. Especially ought it to be so to their <HI>Sur∣viving Relatives.</HI> Then they <HI>freely rise up and speak</HI> what they would not do so freely when their Relative was alive. As when <HI>Dorcas</HI> was laid out, they stood about her Weeping; <HI>telling her good Deeds,</HI> and re∣hearsing one Excellency and another that made her lov'd and desir'd in her Life. <Q>'Tis a Blessing to leave a blessed Name behind one. Blessings come upon the Head of the Just after they are laid in the Grave, out of Sight and out of Hearing.</Q> A blessed Parent thou wert to me, may the <HI>good Child</HI> devoutly say; a singular Blessing had I in Her; her Blessed Counsels and Instructions, her Blessed and Holy Walk with God, shall never be forgotten by me.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. And Lastly, <HI>HER Pious Children Com∣fort themselves that she is among the Blessed.</HI> And indeed <HI>on this side Death</HI> we must call no One Blessed. They that are Holy and

<P><HI>HER Husband also:</HI> It is supposed that he be a <HI>good One;</HI> No <HI>Morose</HI> Person; no <HI>Careless, Negligent</HI> and <HI>Inobservant</HI> Man.

<P><HI>HER Husband also &amp; he praiseth her.</HI> <Q>It is no <HI>Indecency</HI> at all, but a <HI>laudable In∣stance</HI> of Conjugal Love for Husbands and Wives to give one another their due Praises.</Q> But then they shou'd be very <HI>Discreet</HI> in it: <HI>Reserv'd, Cautious, Prudent;</HI> knowing <HI>when, where,</HI> to <HI>whom,</HI> and on what <HI>Occasion</HI> to do it. Wisdom is necessary to <HI>Direct</HI> and to <HI>Restrain.</HI> Wise Consorts will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Lusci∣ous &amp; Foolish</HI> in their Praises of one another; Not <HI>every where,</HI> in <HI>all</HI> Companies, on the most <HI>trivial</HI> Occasion, be telling of one ano∣thers Excellencies.

<P>A GOOD Wife shou'd be <HI>always spoken well of;</HI> that's the <HI>least</HI> that can be <HI>due</HI> to her. She ought to be <HI>convinced</HI> of her Husbands Esteem for her. In <HI>Private</HI> he may well and often declare it to her; Not to <HI>puff up:</HI> No, her Piety and Vertue, her Wisdom and Discretion, her Conduct and Fidelity, her Care and Diligence, her Humility and Mo∣desty are the <HI>Praise.</HI> w. 30. <HI>Favour is de∣ceitful &amp; Beauty is vain, but a Woman that feareth the Lord she shall he praised.</HI></P>
<P>ON some <HI>particular Occasions</HI> there may be <HI>special Reasons</HI> for Praise; and for some <HI>particular Excellency</HI> One Person may merit Praise, and Another for another. <HI>v.</HI> 31. <HI>Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own Works Praise her in the Gates.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>Decent continuance of his Mourning</HI> will be one way of Praising her.

<PB N="22" REF="001803_0026_0FB844022B23BB50"/>and Happiness does very much depend up∣on it, and our <HI>Everlasting Well-Being</HI> is very much promoted by it. What a Blessing is a good <HI>Consort,</HI> a good <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Mother,</HI> a good <HI>Child,</HI> and so a good <HI>Brother</HI> or <HI>Sister?</HI> Yea, a good <HI>Servant</HI> in a Family is an un∣speakable Benefit and Comfort; and so is a good <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Mistress</HI> unto.

How are our Worldly Cares <HI>eased,</HI> our Burdens <HI>lightned,</HI> our Lives <HI>sweetnea</HI> and made Pleasant by these <HI>Gifts</HI> of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>LET us be Excited &amp; Exhorted there∣fore to be very Good in our respective Relations; that we may be Blessings while we Live, &amp; that we may leave a blessed Name behind us when we Die.</HI> Let us so live together as Heirs of Grace as to constrain the Esteem, and en∣deared Affection of our dear Relatives, to be an <HI>Honour to them,</HI> as well as a <HI>Comfort,</HI> their <HI>Joy</HI> and their <HI>Crown;</HI> to leave a <HI>fra∣grant</HI> and <HI>precious Name</HI> behind us that may live with them that Survive, and have their Praises, as long as they shall continue after us.</P>

FOR Instance, What a Price shou'd a <HI>Mo∣ther</HI> put upon the Reverence of her Children, and the Praises of her Husband? How De∣sirable and truly Valuable is it for her to be a <HI>Crown</HI> to her Husband, and an <HI>Honour</HI> to her Posterity? If a Person be not desolate of all <HI>Greatness &amp; Goodness of Spirit,</HI> &amp; Sense of Honour and Reputation, this alone will appear a worthy and sufficient Motive to do Vertuously.</P>
<P>BUT not to confine my self to <HI>One Rela∣tion</HI> only,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>LET Parents be excited to Educate and Instruct well their Children; to give them good Examples, &amp; to treat them with Wisdom and Tenderness, so as to form them for Vertue (un∣der the Blessing of God) &amp; to command their Reverence &amp; Affection to the utmost.</HI> It is not to be expressed what Honours and Com∣forts they may then be to you; and this is the way to make them Honour you, to ren∣der you <HI>Dear &amp; Venerable to them</HI> for Ever. Prov. 20.7. <HI>Ajust Man walketh in his Integri∣ty, his Children are blessed after him.</HI> We shou'd every one of us be Emulous of that
<PB N="24" REF="001803_0028_0FB84408853C5500"/>Character, 1 Tim. 3.4. <HI>One that ruleth his own house well, having his Children in Sub∣jection with all Gravity.</HI> By this means <HI>Bath∣sheba</HI> commanded the high Reverence of her Son <HI>Solomon,</HI> and saw him excel in Wis∣dom under the peculiar Favour of God to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>LET Children be Exhorted to honour their Wise &amp; Gracious Parents, which is the first Commandment with Promise, that their Lives may be long and happy on the Earth.</HI> CHILDREN, Love your Parents, Reve∣rence, Obey and Learn of them now; that you may be an Honour and Comfort to them hereaster. Prov. 1.8. <HI>My Son, hear the Instruction of thy Father, &amp; forsake not the Law of thy Mother; for they shall be an Or∣nament of Grace unto thy Head, &amp; Chains a∣bout thy Neck.</HI> This is to be to their Parents what the Church is to Christ: <HI>My Dove, my Undefiled is but One, she is the only One of her Mother, the choice One of her that bare her; the Dau'ters saw her &amp; blessed her, the Queens &amp; the Concubines &amp; they praised her.</HI> There are <HI>ill</HI> Parents and <HI>ill</HI> Children. Parents like the <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Ahaziah, who was his Counsel∣ler
<PB N="25" REF="001803_0029_0FB84409A460BA98"/>to do wickedly;</HI> and Children that belong to <HI>Agurs wicked Crew,</HI> Prov. 30.11. <HI>There is a Generation that curseth their Father, &amp; doth not bless their Mother. Vicious Parents</HI> are a Dishonour to their Children, and no won∣der their Children <HI>left to themselves</HI> bring them to further Shame. But you that have <HI>Vertuous</HI> and <HI>Tender Parents,</HI> see that you <HI>Requite</HI> them by being Vertuous and Obedi∣ent to them, that you Reverence them in your Hearts, and live so as to Honour them in your Lives.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>LET the Wife see that she do her Duty to her Husband, that she may merit &amp; have the high Reward of his Esteem and just Praises.</HI> This <HI>seek,</HI> after the Honour that cometh from above, yea as a part thereof. It was the <HI>wise Persian Decree</HI> of old, <HI>That all Wives shall give to their Husbands Honour, both great &amp; small,</HI> Esth. 1.20. But we have a greater and more Immutable <HI>Law</HI> than that of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> even CHRIST's: <HI>Let the Wise see that she reverence her Hus∣band; Wives, submit your selves unto your own Husbands as unto the Lord.</HI> &amp;c. Our <HI>Wives</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001803_0030_0FB8440B45487E48"/>shou'd be Ambitious of that Character, 1 Tim. 3.11. <HI>Even so must their Wives be Grave, not Slanderers, Sober, Faithful in all things.</HI> This is the way for them to bear away the <HI>Blessing</HI> of their Children, and the <HI>Praises</HI> of their Husbands.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>LET the Husband be just unto his Ver∣tuous, Prudent and Faithful Wife, to Honour, Esteem and Praise her.</HI> An <HI>Excellent Wife</HI> deserves a <HI>singular Respect,</HI> and the most <HI>Ho∣nourable Treatment</HI> in the World. The Ex∣pressions of the Love of Christ to His Church in the Book of <HI>Canticles</HI> is the best Account how the Husband ought to regard her and treat her. And indeed this is the Rule which Christ has given to the Christian Husband: Eph. 5.25. <HI>Husbands, love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave him∣self for it; that he might Sanctifie it and pre∣sent it Glorious.</HI> What a <HI>Word</HI> is this? As the <HI>Holy Soul,</HI> and as the <HI>Purchased Church</HI> is <HI>Fair</HI> and <HI>Lovely</HI> in the Eyes of GOD, and <HI>Dignified</HI> by Him; so let the deserving Wife be Esteemed by her happy Spouse.</ITEM>

<ITEM>1. <HI>LET them that are happy in their Rela∣tives, in their Consorts or Children, in their Parents,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>be very thankful to GOD who has chosen so graciously for them, &amp; Serve Him with the more Alacrity &amp; Chearfulness, especi∣ally in the discharge of the Duties of their re∣spective Relations.</HI> If there be any <HI>Vertue,</HI> if there be any <HI>Praise,</HI> think of it in your <HI>Re∣latives,</HI> observe it, but do not <HI>ascribe</HI> it to them, nor love them <HI>only</HI> for it; but give God the <HI>Glory</HI> of it, receive <HI>from</HI> Him, im∣prove it <HI>for</HI> Him, and love <HI>Him</HI> the Giver. Every Creature is what God <HI>makes it,</HI> and what He makes it <HI>to us.</HI> He gave the <HI>Ex∣cellencies</HI> which thy dear Relation is Adoin'd with, and then He gave the Person <HI>to thee.</HI> So He form'd <HI>Eve</HI> for <HI>Adam,</HI> and gave to them their Gracious <HI>Abel</HI> and <HI>Seth.</HI> Hast

So again, <HI>Children are an Heritage of the Lord, &amp; the fruit of the Womb is his Reward,</HI> Psal. 117.3. <HI>They are the Chil∣dren which God hath graciously given thy Ser∣vant;</HI> said <HI>Jacob</HI> concerning his <HI>Sons.</HI> We should never look upon our good and plea∣sant Relations but our hearts should be full of <HI>holy Gratitude</HI> to God for them. And our Gratitude to God on this account should give us <HI>Alacrity &amp; Chearfulness</HI> in our whole Conversation. As our cares are <HI>lessened</HI> and our lives <HI>sweetned,</HI> so let our hearts be <HI>En∣larged &amp; list up in</HI> the way of our Duty. Eccl. 97, 8, 9, 10. <HI>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, &amp; drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy works. Let thy garments be always white, &amp; let thy head lack no oynt∣ment. Live joyfully with the Wife whom thou lovest, all the dayes of the life of thy vanity,
<PB N="29" REF="001803_0033_0FB8441125D42C70"/>which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, &amp; in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is no work, nor device, nor knowlege, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>LET us bear humbly &amp; improve fruit∣fully the want or the loss of such a Blessing as we have been Meditating.</HI> The <HI>Wife</HI> and the <HI>Mother</HI> which the <HI>Text</HI> speaks of does not fall to every ones Lot. Sometimes the Wise &amp; Vertuous themselves are <HI>ill-match'd</HI> and related. <HI>Solomon</HI> tells of the <HI>Contenti∣ons that are a continual dropping, &amp; of the angry &amp; brawling woman, whom one had better dwell in the wilderness than live with.</HI> If the Mother be <HI>leud, prophane, a scold, fierce, cruel;</HI> if she be <HI>foolish, fond, indulgent, ignorant, careless, lavish, negligent, idle, good for no∣thing:</HI> This <HI>is a Grief</HI> and must be <HI>born,</HI> heavily eno'. It is a <HI>living Sorrow,</HI> and a sore Rebuke from God, which calls to Hu∣miliation. Her Children <HI>cannot</HI> rise up and call her Blessed, nor is it <HI>lawful</HI> for the Hus∣band
<PB N="30" REF="001803_0034_0FB8441473E9C798"/>to Praise. Love and Duty must <HI>silent∣ly cover</HI> a multitude of Faults, and they must take up their <HI>Crass</HI> daily. And <HI>happy</HI> the Person in that case who has learnt this <HI>Lesson.</HI></ITEM>

<P>BUT then there are <HI>Others</HI> who have been Blessed with such <HI>Excellent Relatives</HI> whom they could not but Esteem and Praise, Re∣joyce in, and Bless God for; <HI>but God takes them away, they Dye,</HI> we are Bereaved and call'd to Mourning and Weeping under the Blow of Gods Hand, whereby He <HI>takes a∣way the desire of our Eyes with a Stroke.</HI> This also we must desire humbly to <HI>bear,</HI> fruitfully to <HI>improve,</HI> and get the Spiritual Good of.</P>
<P>How often are <HI>Pious Children</HI> thus Be∣reaved of their Parents, and <HI>bowed down hea∣vily, Mourning for their Mother?</HI> How of∣ten are <HI>Happy Consorts</HI> rent by Death from one anothers Arms, and the Surviver left among the most <HI>Afflicted &amp; Desolate.</HI> Here <HI>moderate</HI> your Mourning, and <HI>Resign</HI> to God what He gave and what He takes. <HI>Shall we receive Good from the Hand of the Lord? and shall we not receive Evil?
