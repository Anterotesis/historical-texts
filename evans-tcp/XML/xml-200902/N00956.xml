<P>THE Sins of the Prosessing People of God doe provoke Him to Anger; Men are wont to make many Pre∣tences

Thus it was with the People of <HI>Judah,</HI> they were at present in great Prosperity: <HI>Isa</HI> 2.7. <HI>Their Land is full of Silver and Gold, neither is there any end of their treasures, their Land is also full of Horses, neither is there any end of their Cha∣riots.</HI> But they carried themselves very bad∣ly: We have an Account in general, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> 8, 9 <HI>Their tongue and their doings are against the Lord to provoke the Eyes of his Glory, the show of their Countenance doth witness against them, and they declare their Sin as Sodom, and hide it not.</HI> In particular they were guilty of Idolatry, <HI>Chap</HI> 2 <HI>v.</HI> 8. <HI>Their Land is full of. Idols, they worship the work of their own bands:</HI> and of horrible Pride, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> 16. <HI>The Daughters of Sion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks, and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a ticking with their feet.</HI> And accordingly God is threatning of them with dreadful Judgments, <HI>v</HI> 1. with Famine and Drought, <HI>v.</HI> 2.3. with the Removal of Usefull men:</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001146_0005_0FB08EEDA1FB2860"/>
For the understanding of the words,</P>
<P>Consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. Who he would take away? <HI>A.</HI> In general, Usefull Men: such as in their seve∣ral Capacities were very Serviceable and Pro∣fitable to the Common-wealth; Men that were an honour to the Land, and capable to advance and promote the Wellfare of it. Some by reason of their injoyments, as the <HI>Mighty Men:</HI> some by reason of their qualifications, as the <HI>Prudent,</HI> the <HI>Artificer,</HI> and the <HI>Oratour:</HI> some by reason of their experi∣ence, as the <HI>Ancient:</HI> some by reason of the Offices and Stations that they were in, in the Common wealth, as the <HI>Judge,</HI> the <HI>Prophet,</HI> the <HI>Counsellor,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. How does he threaten to take them a∣way? <HI>A.</HI> As a Judgment on the Publick Society. There might be anger against some of them: some of them might be taken away in anger against themselves, as <HI>Saul: God took him away in his wrath, Hos.</HI> 13 11. Some of them may be taken away in mercy to themselves: <HI>they are taken away from the Evil to come, Isa.</HI> 57 1. But here it is threatned as a Publick Calamity; that which enfeebles the Common wealth, and exposes them to sorrow. God may take such away by Mor∣tality, in Battle, by Captivity: he does not
<PB N="4" REF="001146_0006_0FB08EF4C7A1EB20"/>say that he will take away all such, but many of them.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>There is many times a Great Frown in</HI> GODS <HI>taking away those that are Eminently Ʋsefull.</HI></Q>
<P>GOD has many ways to punish a disobe∣dient People; sometimes he punishes them by Wars, by Sicknesses, by Inundations, by Earthquakes, by Fires, by Blastings, by a Spi∣rit of Division; this is one among the rest, by the Death of Usefull men. There may be a great Frown in Gods taking away such Young men, as were hopefull to be men for Publick Service; as when he took away <HI>Je∣roboams</HI> Son: so especially when he takes a∣way such as were men of Service: this is not alwayes a Frown, for if God have no Controversy with his People, yet such must dye according to the course of Nature; but ordinarily it is a Frown: Usefull and Servi∣ceable men are a Publick Blessing; and it is a Publick Frown when God removes them: as God Frowns upon a People, when he takes a∣way their Health, their Peace, their Wealth;
<PB N="5" REF="001146_0007_0FB08EF76AF423B8"/>so he does likewise when he takes away those that were a means to preserve their spiritual and outward Prosperity: Men that are emi∣nently Usefull are the Pillars of the Church &amp; the Common-wealth, &amp; it is a great weak∣ning to the Society when such are removed. God smiles upon a People, when he raises up Serviceable men, and he Frowns upon them, when he snatches such away: many times it is a token of great anger when such men are removed, and they feel the bitter effects thereof many years after: when their Lives are lost, the Publick Society has a great loss: much of the Prosperity of a People is buried in the Graves of Useful men. <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> Death and <HI>Josiahs</HI> gave a deadly wound to the People of <HI>Judah,</HI> and was matter of great Mourning, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 35.25. <HI>Jeremiah Lamented for Josiah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 1. Because Usefull men are an Honour to the People. Usefull men are up∣on that Account Honourable. Their Use∣fulness does command Reputation: they de∣serve respect and a good report upon that account. 1 <HI>Sam</HI> 9 6. <HI>He is an honourable man.</HI> 2 King. 5.1. <HI>He was honourable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.</HI> And their honourableness does reflect
<PB N="6" REF="001146_0008_0FB08EF902D4C6F8"/>honour upon the People that they belong unto. As vile base men are a reproach and disgrace to the People that they belong unto, men are ashamed of them; so honou∣rable and usefull men are an honour to the place. It was an honour to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> that there were so many Worthies in the Land in the dayes of <HI>David.</HI> It is a commendation of a People in other Coun∣tries: Usefull men are an honour to all that are related to them. An Usefull man is an honour to his Parents, to his Children, to his Wife, to the place of his Nativity, to the place where he Lives: Honourable men make the place renowned where they dwell: it is an honour to a People to have choice men for Magistrates and for Ministers; it raises the Estimation of a People in the Eye of the World. <HI>Zech.</HI> 10.4. <HI>Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressour toge∣gether;</HI> that is, such as suppress and subdue their Enemies. <HI>Psal.</HI> 87.5. <HI>Of Sion it shall be said, this and that man was born in her.</HI> And when such men are removed the honour of a People is diminished; their Estimation and renown does decay and wither away: their honour will sink because the foundation of it is taken away; those that supported it
<PB N="7" REF="001146_0009_0FB08EFFDC955A30"/>are removed: So they lose much of that fame and respect that they had.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 2. Because such men have a great interest in the affection of others. Useful men discover Love: their qualifications are love∣ly, and their Service draws forth Love: the Consciences of other men doe give a testi∣mony unto them, and their hearts are Cap∣tivated thereby. Partly from the testimony of their Conscience, and partly from a sence of their own benefit, they have a Love to such men, and cannot but prize them; they love to see them, and love to converse with them. <HI>Job</HI> 29.11, 12. <HI>When the ear heard me then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me it gave witness unto me, because I delivered the poor that cryed, the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</HI> 1 Sam. 18.16. <HI>All Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</HI> And because they have an affection to them, it is an affliction to have them removed. If a man have a great affection to his Wife or his Child, it is the greater affliction to have them taken away. People are smitten with grief and sorrow at the Death of such Persons, their hearts are wounded, their joy is turned into sorrow, it makes them goe with heavy hearts.
<PB N="8" REF="001146_0010_0FB08F012D24FDD8"/>2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.17. <HI>And David Lamented with this Lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his Son.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 2. Because such men doe procure a great deal of Good and prevent a great deal of Calamity. They are profitable to the Societies that they did belong to. So was <HI>Jehoiada,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24.16. <HI>They buried him in the City of David among the Kings, because he had done good in Israel, both towards God, and towards his house:</HI> When such men are Dead People many times want their Service, and so are exposed to a great deal of Calamity, which by their presence might have been prevented.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some by their Justice do a great deal of good. They are careful to deliver them that are innocent. Many men would make a prey of others, and under pretences of Law devour the Estates of other men, but while those that are in Authority are men of Justice, they will give no countenance to such things. Job 29.15, 16, 17. <HI>I was Eyes to the blind, and Feet was I to the lame, I was a Father to the poor, and the cause that I knew not I searched out: and I brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the spoil out of his teeth.</HI> So
<PB N="9" REF="001146_0011_0FB08F02B8FD3BC0"/>did <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 8.15. <HI>David Entented Judgment and Justice to all his people:</HI> So <HI>Jo∣siah,</HI> Jer. 22.15. <HI>Did not thy Father do Judg∣ment and Justice.</HI> Such men will not be o∣ver-ruled by affection, bribed by mens Mo∣ney, or frighted with their greatness: <HI>Job</HI> 31.34. <HI>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of Families terrifie me, that I kept si∣lence and went not out of the door.</HI> But after such men are dead, sometimes instead of the Firr-tree comes up the thorn, and instead of the mirtle-tree comes up the briar; men get into Place of Power, that prevent Judgment, that incourage those that are wicked. <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.22, 23. <HI>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water, thy Princes are, rebellions, and companions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards, they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the Widow come unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Some also by their skill, wisdom and experience do a great deal of good. Some are well skilled in the Law and able to di∣rect in difficult cases; they are men of abi∣lity to discern between right and wrong, to see through cases that have intanglements and perplexity in them: This was that, that he prayed for, 1 King. 3.9. <HI>Give thy Ser∣vant
<PB N="10" REF="001146_0012_0FB08F0752881848"/>an understanding heart, to judge thy Peo∣ple, that I may discern between good and bad.</HI> They are men of prudence to find out pro∣per means to advance the publick good; to find out expedients in difficult cases, and to discern what is to be done, to advance Re∣ligion, to prevent miscarriages, to advance peace, and compose differences. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.32. <HI>Men that had understanding in the times to know what Israel ought to do:</HI> By their expe∣rience they are fitted to take right methods in doubtful cases. But many times when such men are dead, such may arise after them, as are ignorant and unskilful, rash and unexperienced men, who by their precipi∣tate counsels expose a Land to much mise∣ry: So the Young men that were bred with <HI>Rehoboam</HI> gave foolish counsel, and laid a foundation of lasting sorrow to <HI>Israel</HI> by their rashness, they opened a gap that let in a flood of misery: 1 <HI>King.</HI> 12.10, 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some by their valour. Leading men, that have been men of valour, have done mighty Service to their Country: they have been instruments under God to save it out of the hands of Enemies; and to inlarge the Dominions of the Country: Valour inables men to look dangers in the face; makes
<PB N="11" REF="001146_0013_0FB08F0DABCE7E28"/>them willing to run the hazard of their lives. <HI>Judg.</HI> 12.3. <HI>I put my life in my hand.</HI> They are instruments to free the Land from Servitude and Bondage: a valiant Leader animates Souldiers, his Courage begets Cou∣rage in others, and damps and discourages Enemies, such Leaders are a terror to Ene∣mies. <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.9. <HI>Judah is a lions whelp from the prey, my Son thou art gone up; he stooped down, be couched as a lien, and as an old lion, who shall rouse him up?</HI> In this way <HI>Barak</HI> and <HI>Gideon</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David</HI> did abun∣dance of good in their Generations, they vanquished the Enemies of <HI>Israel: From the blood of the Slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.22. But many times when such men are dead, for want of others of the same Spirit, people are harressed and brought under hatches.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some by their Examples also do much good. They are exemplary in Religion, diligently practising all the rules of it. So <HI>David</HI> was a diligent Worshipper of God; so was <HI>Job,</HI> Job 1.1. <HI>One that feared God;</HI> they are examples of sobriety, of humility, of peaceableness, of chastity and charity;
<PB N="12" REF="001146_0014_0FB08F0EB9EC4AF8"/>and hereby others are led on to carry them∣selves well, many will follow the examples of principal men, and out of a respect to them, comply with their wayes, and so get good habits: But sometimes when such men are dead, there arise others in their room, that give bad examples, don't much counte∣nance Religion, are pot companions, men of rude behaviour, tainted with corrupt practices, these examples will poison other men, and infect a Country, others will quickly learn such ways, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.12. <HI>If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his Servants are wick∣ed.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Some by their Honourableness also do abundance of good. They are men well respected, and upon that account capable to do abundance of Service; their proposals are much hearkened to by those that are in Supream Authority in the Country: If they make a motion for the good of the places where they live, they are readily hearken∣ed unto, their judgment and fidelity is relied on; they can do a man a kindness with their word. The Prophet enquires of the woman of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whether she would be spo∣ken for to the King or to the Captain of the Host,</HI> 2 <HI>King.</HI> 4 13. He could have done her a kindness in that way: They can have
<PB N="13" REF="001146_0015_0FB08F1036148738"/>access to those in Chief Authority, when others cannot; their word will be regarded, when the word of others will not. So be∣ing honourable, they bear much sway a∣mong the people: In many cases their judgment is a law, they can easily crush evil motions, and put a stop to corrupt and fact∣ious designs; they can perswade and draw people to that which is for their good: Others will be willing to please, will be fearful of displeasing, will have an high opinion of their judgment. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.36. <HI>Whatsoever the King did pleased the people;</HI> but many times when such are dead, others that come after have no such influence; their advice and proposals will not bear sway: others will slight them and thwart them: They that dared not to speak a word in the days of <HI>Solomon,</HI> grew trouble∣some after he was dead. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 12.3, 4.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE I.</HEAD>
<P>It is a great Mercy when God raises up Serviceable Men among his People. Some∣times it is otherwise among the People of God. <HI>Isa.</HI> 51.18. <HI>There is none to guide her among the Sons which she hath brought forth, neither is there any that taketh her by the hand,
<PB N="14" REF="001146_0016_0FB08F11DA644578"/>of all the Sons which she hath brought up.</HI> But it is a great Mercy when he raises up Ser∣viceable Men. <HI>Amos</HI> 2.11. <HI>I raised up of your Sons for Prophets, and of your Young men for Nazarites</HI> Isa 1.26. <HI>I will restore thy Judges as at the first, and thy Counsellors as at the be∣ginning.</HI> Jer. 3 15. <HI>I will give them Pastors after my own heart, that shall feed them with knowledge and understanding.</HI> This greatly helps forward the Welfare of a People: It is Gods work to raise up Serviceable men: He gives them their qualifications, natural and acquired; He gives them those enjoy∣ments that fit them for Publick place: He makes them Conscientious, Religious and Godly men, and he bestows actual advance∣ment on them; He makes them to find favour that they may be put in place. And when he does thus, he greatly favours a People, for this makes way for the outward Prosperity of a People, that they may live quietly and peaceably; and this makes way for their Spiritual Prosperity, that they may be a Religious, Godly and well carriaged People; it is a special means to make a People happy.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="001146_0017_0FB08F1AC630D6C0"/>
1. This contributes more to the welfare of a people, then for their Rulers to know their duty. If Rulers be not fitted to be Serviceable, all things will run to ruine tho' they know their duty; if they know they should be just, and give good examples, and seek the publick Welfare, yet they may lye in the woful neglect of it. Some mens know∣ledge does but make them more capable to do mischief; knowing men if they be not well disposed, will do abundantly more hurt than good; if they be like toads, it will be little advantage that they have got pearls in their heads; it had been well for a Coun∣try if some men had been born fools: <HI>Da∣vid</HI> was more afraid of <HI>Ahitophel</HI> then of others. 2 Sam. 15.31. <HI>O Lord, I pray thee, turn the Counsel of Ahitophel into foolish∣ness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This contributes a great deal more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Laws. It is a great part of the care of Rulers to make good Laws: Good Laws in Civil, and so in Criminal Cases, have their influence into the Welfare of a Country. That was one thing wherein the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were more happy than other people; they had good Laws prescri∣bed unto them. <HI>What Nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous, as
<PB N="16" REF="001146_0018_0FB08F1CECE09620"/>all this Law which I set before you this day.</HI> Deut 4.8. But good Laws will signifie little, if the men that are at Helm, be not fitted for Service. Laws are like a Sword, which if it be kept in a Scabbard will do no Execution The Children of <HI>Israel</HI> had very good Laws, Laws given them by God himself, yet many times were very misera∣ble. Laws are like Physick, which if it be not administred, or duly administred, does no service. Laws as written may do a lit∣tle good, but as Executed do far more: The Execution of the Law does rectify miscar∣riages past, and prevent miscarriages for the time to come. But good Laws will be as a nose of wax, as the Papists say of the Scripture, if <HI>Joel</HI> and <HI>Abiah</HI> have the ma∣nagement of them. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 8.3. <HI>They fol∣lowed after lucre, took bribes, and perverted judgment.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This will contribute more than Learn∣ed Education. Several Young ones in the Country have liberal Education, and are furnished with Learning, whereby they are more inabled to get skill in the Law, and to discover the fraud in false pleas: But this will not make the Country happy, if they have not a Spirit to do Service. Men of
<PB N="17" REF="001146_0019_0FB08F1E62E75D20"/>Learned Education through other unfitnesses may expose a People to great Calamity. Learned Education is an help both to Civi∣lity and Piety, but it cannot effect either. Some Learned men had need to Learn some∣what more, before ever they will do any great matter, in order to the happiness of the Land. The <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> had Learned Educations, yet helped forward the ruine of the <HI>Jews:</HI> Men that are brought up at the feet of <HI>Gemaliel,</HI> have need (as <HI>Paul</HI>) to see a light from Heaven.</P>

<P>Such men as are Usefull and Serviceable should not be despised. There is an evil Spirit prevailing in some, and they are ready under one pretence or another to despise Usefull men: as <HI>Michal</HI> despised <HI>David</HI> in her heart. There be many that honour them, yet there be others that un∣dervalue them. It is the Spirit of <HI>men of Belial to despise such,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.27. But if men be Serviceable men, they are great Blessings, and it is a Frown when God re∣moves them, and those men are blame worthy that do despise them, whatever notion they do it under.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="001146_0020_0FB08F1FE1C29FB8"/>
1. Some do it under a notion, that they have such and such Infirmities. But if we grant that they have, (though some men count those things faults and infirmities that are none;) yet they may not be despised. <HI>Humanum est Errare,</HI> where shall we find men without infirmities? If <HI>David</HI> acted rashly in the matter of <HI>Mephibosheth,</HI> must he be despised? If <HI>Asa</HI> did not take away the high places, must he be despised? If <HI>Jeho∣shaphat</HI> was overseen in joyning with <HI>Ahab,</HI> must he be despised? If <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> heart were lifted up when the Ambassadours came from <HI>Babylon,</HI> must he be despised? If it were a precipitate thing for <HI>Josiah</HI> to take the field against the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> must he be despised? Men at the best are but men compassed about with infirmities. God honours men though they have infirmities. 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 19 3. <HI>Nevertheless there are good things found in thee.</HI> God hears the Prayers of his People, though they have infirmities. <HI>James</HI> 5.17. <HI>Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he Prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth, by the space of three years and six months.</HI> Their infirmities are a dishonour unto them, but they are to be honoured notwithstanding
<PB N="19" REF="001146_0021_0FB08F281471A868"/>their infirmities: infirmities are blemishes, but yet <HI>They</HI> may be praise worthy for all them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some do it under a notion that we have plenty of men sit for choice Service. That we want rather Offices for men than men for Offices: the Country it full of able men. It is very fit that we should take notice of what there is of that nature with thankfulness: But indeed many things must meet together to make men meet for some Offices. He that may do God and his Country good Service, in a lower Station, may be altogether unfit for an higher Sta∣tion. The Country runs low enough in men. We have nothing to boast of but have cause to be humbled before God, that there be so few every way accomplished for Publick Service; it is a small matter in such a Country as this to make a Profession of Religion. Some that carry pretty well are not like them that went before them. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 14 3. <HI>He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not like David his Father.</HI> When the foundation of the Se∣cond Temple was laid, the young men re∣joyced, but the old men wept.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="20" REF="001146_0022_0FB08F29B227C478"/>
3. Some do it under a notion that they might have been more Serviceable. It is acknowledged that they do a pretty deal of Service; but men despise them because they had Opportunity and Advantage to have done more. But if the thing be true, yet they are to be honoured on the account of what they have done: if they had had more zeal and industry and of a Publick Spirit, it had been better: yet possibly they have been great blessings: if through mistake they did not rectify some abuses, if tempta∣tion did prevail with them, to be more in∣dulgent than they should, yet they are not to be despised. Where is the man that might not have done more good, than he has done?

<P N="4">4. Some do it under a notion that they were Ancient. They were grown old, and had less activity than before, that their Judgment and Memory began to fail them. But we find in Scripture the <HI>Ancient and the Honourable</HI> joyned together, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.15. An∣cient men are to be honoured on the account
<PB N="21" REF="001146_0023_0FB08F2B26882E78"/>of what they have done. <HI>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of Righteousness, Prov.</HI> 16.31. Ancient men are to be honoured upon the account of their Prudence and Experience; the <HI>Prudent and the Ancient</HI> are joyned together in the Text. <HI>Job</HI> 12.12. <HI>With the Ancient is Wisdom.</HI> The Ancient men that stood before <HI>Solomon,</HI> might be thought timerous and inclining to dotage by <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> but it would have been well for him, if he had followed their advice: They were fitter to give counsel than he was to receive it.</P>

<HEAD>USE. III. Of HUMILIATION.</HEAD>
<P>That God is removing Serviceable man from among us. We have cause to look upon this a great frown from God: beside several others that God has taken away in former times, He has more lately removed his Servant <HI>DANFORTH,</HI> and since that his Servant <HI>STOUGHTON,</HI> and now another Honourable man is taken away: a great man is fallen this is day in our <HI>Israel,</HI> and it becomes us to Mourn and La∣ment under this dispensation.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="001146_0024_0FB08F2E44BCB520"/>
1. <HI>Observe,</HI> That God has removed one that has been along while Serviceable. That has been improved about Publick Service for above <HI>Fifty Years:</HI> he has been Serviceable unto the Country in general, and in special among our selves. He hath had the princi∣pal management of our Military Affairs, and our Civil Affairs: and laboured much in the setling of most of our Plantations, has managed things with Industry, Prudence and Moderation. He hath been careful in time of War, and as there has been occasion, he has been a Peace Maker among us, and helpfull in composing of differences: he has discountenanced Rude and Vicious Per∣sons, bearing his Testimony against them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is to be feared that we shall feel the sorrowful effects of his removal a long while. Some times when Parents dye, Children don't at present so much feel the want of them, as they do afterwards. We may have occasion afterwards to remember with sor∣row that we had such an One among us: Though we have other Useful men, yet there may arise such Cases wherein there may be great need of his conduct and help. He was honourable and had great influence
<PB N="23" REF="001146_0025_0FB08F35F08D1B90"/>upon men in Authority abroad, and upon the People at home, and had more experi∣ence by far, than any other among us.</P>
<P N="3">3. This comes in Conjunction with other Sorrows. We are under an expectation of Trouble from Enemies; and are under the heavy Hand of God, in the Diseases that prevail in the Land. The Afflictions of our principal Town are very great, many Fami∣lies are Mourning over their Dead. God is pleading his Controversy with us in that Terrible Mortality, and in such a day as this, God has added this Affliction to ag∣gravate our Sorrow; if it had come alone, it had been heavy, but now we have one wave and billow upon another. Our Af∣flictions are like <HI>Jobs,</HI> one comes upon the neck of another. There was great anger before, but God sees cause to make this ad∣dition to it: Our Cup was bitter before, this makes it more bitter: if it had come in a time of Prosperity, it had been sad, but being in a time of Adversity, it is more sad. It is the manner of God many times to comfort his People in their Affliction, but he is adding to the grief of them that were wounded before.</P>

<HEAD><HI>USE IV.</HI> Of EXHORTATION</HEAD>
<P>To such of You as are in Power, or may upon this occasion be put in Power. Carry so that we may not have so much cause to lament this Dispensation. The more Serviceable you are in your Places, the less there will be of a Frown in the Removal of this Honourable Person. If you answer the expectation of God and man from you, that will wonderfully mo∣derate our grief. You commend him for being Serviceable, be you so too; you say he was a Father to the Country, be you so too; you are capable to do a great deal of Service, do so, and that will be like clear shining after rain.</P>
<P>Particularly I intreat you,</P>
<P N="1">1. That in all Causes that come before you, you would act in the fear of God. You must not act either with a preposterous zeal, or with a spirit of sinful indulgence. You must have a great care that you do not con∣demn the Righteous, or justify the Wicked;
<PB N="25" REF="001146_0027_0FB08F38D0BE1648"/>such proceedings are both of them alike a∣bominable unto God: in all Controversies between man and man, you must act im∣partially: you may not out of love, or pit∣ty, or anger be influenced in giving Judg∣ment: if you have a mind to befriend men, befriend them in other ways; but in Judg∣ment have no respect of persons; it is pro∣verbial, <HI>That a Friend in the Court is better than a penny in the Purse;</HI> but you must be friends to no man, any further than his Cause requireth; you must have a care that you do not countenance any malicious prosecutions, but act in the fear of God. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.6. <HI>He said to the Judges, take heed what you do, for you judge not for man, but for the Lord:</HI> v. 7. <HI>Let the fear of God be upon you; take heed and do it,</HI> v. 9. <HI>Thus shall you do in the fear of God faithfully, and with a perfect heart,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.5. <HI>He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</HI> You must so act, that when men hear what judgment you give, they may not do as those, <HI>Luk.</HI> 23.48. <HI>They Smote their breasts and returned;</HI> but as it was with the people, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 3.28. <HI>They feared the King, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="001146_0028_0FB08F41223468A0"/>
2. That you be good examples to the people. They who are to reclaim others from evil, should themselves carry well: if you be bad examples, you will draw on o∣thers to do the like; others will be hold from your example: Your practices will be presidential, and will be used as an argu∣ment either to justifie or excuse evil. With what face can you punish evil in others, and practise it your selves. Leading men should be sure to lead well. If you carry holily and regularly, you will bring good carriages into request: that will make men to love such carriages, that will make men to expect no favour if they carry <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Mi∣nisters must be Examples, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5 3 And so must Magistrates too; so was <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and <HI>Josiah,</HI> and others. Be Examples of Religion, be Examples of fair honest deal∣ing, of sobriety, of chastity, and peaceable∣ness, and all other vertuous carriages. Bad carriages in Rulers are a greater reproach than in other men, and of more pernicious consequence; Good men are grieved, and bad men are hardened thereby; though they do punish others for their miscarriages, they do more for the increase, then they do for the suppression of Sin; they are but
<PB N="27" REF="001146_0029_0FB08F432817F638"/>pretended friends to Holiness, for they are real enemies to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. That you do nothing to promote any man of vicious Conversation. The princi∣pal power of promoting men to place of Command lies with others; but you may have a considerable influence by informati∣on and request. But it is surely an ill Of∣fice to help forward the promotion of any vicious person, either to Military Offices, or to Civil Power. It is a great wrong to a∣ny people to have vicious men Set over them; the Setting up of vicious men in places of Power, opens a door to abun∣dance of iniquity; they will mightily in∣crease the Degeneracy of the Land. Let men learn to govern themselves, before they be set to govern others: Honour is not seemly for a fool. Such men have more need to be ruled than to rule. Such men have no need to be incouraged, but to be discountenanced; holy and well carriaged men are more like to do Service. If men have wit and understanding, yet they will do more hurt than good, if they be vici∣ous: their wit is an argument against their promotion, not for it; for the more wit∣ty,
<PB N="28" REF="001146_0030_0FB08F44DC0DE668"/>the more mischievous. Labour to promote holy men, Psal. 101.6. <HI>Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me, He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall Serve me.</HI></P>
