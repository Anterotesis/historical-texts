<HEAD>The PRINTER to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Manuscript Copy of this Translation of <HI>Cato's Moral Distichs,</HI> happened into my Hands some Time since, and being my self extreamly pleased with it, I thought it might be no less acceptable to the Publick; and there∣fore determined to print it as soon as I should have conve∣nient Leisure and Opportunity. It was done by a Gentle∣man amongst us (whose Name or Character I am strictly forbid to mention, tho' it might give some Advantage to my Edition) for the Use of his own Children; But in my Opinion, it is no unfit or unprofitable Entertainment for those of riper Years. For certainly, such excellent Pre∣cepts of Morality, contain'd in such short and easily-remem∣ber'd Sentences, may to Youth particularly be very service∣able in the Conduct of Life, since there can scarce happen any Affair of Importance to us, in which we may need Ad∣vice, but one or more of these Distichs suited to the Occa∣sion,
<PB N="iv" REF="003884_0003_10020D9DE6B01550"/>will seasonably occur to the Memory, if the Book has been read and studied with a proper Care and Attention.</P>
<P>When I obtained Leave to make this Publication, I pro∣cured also the following Account of the Author and his Work: for I thought something of the kind necessary to be prefix'd to it.</P>
<P>In most Places that I am acquainted with, so great is the present Corruption of Manners, that a Printer shall find much more Profit in such Things as flatter and encou∣rage Vice, than in such as tend to promote its contrary. It would be thought a Piece of Hypocrisy and pharisaical Ostentation in me, if I should say, that I print these <HI>Dis∣tichs</HI> more with a View to the Good of others than my own private Advantage: And indeed I cannot say it; for I con∣fess, I have so great Confidence in the common Virtue and Good Sense of the People of this and the neighbouring Pro∣vinces, that I expect to sell a very good Impression.</P>

<HEAD>Some ACCOUNT of the fol∣lowing Piece, and Conjectures concerning its AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the Original of these Moral Distichs, by being put into the Hands of Boys of the lower Forms at the Latin School, have been frequently considered as an Entertainment suitable only to such childish Years; yet great and able Judges have conceived a much more honourable Esteem of them. They have been commented on by divers Authors, but particularly by <HI>Erasmus:</HI> They were translated into Greek by <HI>Maximus Planudes,</HI> a native of <HI>Greece,</HI> and one of the most learned of his Age. But the great <HI>Joseph Scaliger,</HI> dissatisfyed with that Performance, gave another most elegant Version of them into the same Language, which has been divers times printed. And tho' a Critic in that Tongue, on viewing the Version, would not easily be induced to believe it could be better'd, yet it has been twice since attempted by two other several Hands, mentioned by <HI>Fabricius.</HI> So that at least four Greek Translations of them have appeared. Into the European Languages, as French, Italian, Dutch, there have been many Translations, and into each of them by several Hands. They have also been divers Times render'd into our own; but the Author of this never saw any of them, that by <HI>Charles Hoole,</HI> made in plain and low Lan∣guage for the Use of School-boys, only excepted; and therefore he knows not but they may have been much better done before: But as he intended them (as th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are here finished) solely for the Use of his own Children, with some of their Acquaintance, and never for publick View, he is no way solicitous what others may have perform'd, provided these as they are, will answer the End they were intended for. Those who find Fault with them may try to do better on any Score of them together, and then they will be more capable of judging, whether it is a very easy Task throughout the
<PB N="vi" REF="003884_0005_10020DA14743AA38"/>whole, to comprize the Sense of two Latin Hexameters in twenty Syllables in English, with a smooth Cadence, and tagg'd with a strong Rhime.</P>
<P>Of the Author of these <HI>Distichs</HI> there have been various Sentiments; they are call'd <HI>Cato's,</HI> but they could neither be the Work of the Censor, the elder of that Name, nor of the much greater Man the younger, call'd <HI>Uticensis</HI> from the Place of his Death: For in these Verses, <HI>Virgil, Macer, Ovid,</HI> and <HI>Lucan,</HI> are mention'd, none of whom wrote till after the Death of both these <HI>Cato's.</HI> The first of the Antients whose Works remain, that appears to have known them, is one <HI>Vindicianus</HI> a Physician, who in a Letter to the Emperor <HI>Valentinian</HI> the elder, about the Year 370, quotes one of these Lines: And in a Glossary printed at the end of the <HI>Autores L. Latinae,</HI> said to be <HI>Isidore</HI>'s, who died about the Year 630, the uncommon Word <HI>Officipedi</HI> is found, and <HI>Cato</HI> is expressly quoted for it as an Author; which Word [in another Declension] is met with in the 4th Book, Numb. 42 of these Distichs</P>
<P>Some have thought him a later Christian Writer; but for the Reasons given he could not be late, nor could he be a Christian; for no Christian would have been Author of that Distich, <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.</P>
<Q><L>Cum sis ipse nocens moritur cur Victima pro te?</L>
<L><HI>Stultitia est morte alterius sperare Salutem.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Since this is directly repugnant to the main Fundamental of the Chris∣tian Religion. <HI>Scaliger's</HI> Opinion, upon a due Consideration of the Stile (which is allow'd by all but <HI>Boxhornius</HI> to be correct and pure) and of all other Circumstances, seems to be the most just; which is, that he was an unconverted Gentile, and lived about the Times of <HI>Commodus</HI> or <HI>Severus;</HI> that is, towards the beginning of the third Century: To which may be added, that 'tis probable he might be inclin'd to the Doctrine of the <HI>Py∣thagoreans</HI> and <HI>Platonists,</HI> which was revived and came much into Repute a∣bout that Time. But whoever the Author was, notwithstanding they have a Fault very common with most of the Ancients, that is, that there is scarce any Order in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> divers Repetitions, as also that sometimes the Thought is either low or obscure, (which 'tis hoped is somewhat mended in the present Version) yet they have been very justly esteemed in all Ages past, since they were known; and in those to come may con∣tinue justly to deserve the same.</P>
