<P>AS there is great Variety in the inclinations of Men in general, so 'tis particularly remarkable in those who addict themselves to the Studies of Nature and Humane Lite∣rature: For some with great Eagerness enquire into the Ope∣rations of Nature, and the Natural Causes of Things; some endeavour to dig up Antiquities from the Dark, by searching out the Signification of Statues and Inscriptions of Antique Stones, and old and almost worn out Medals; and others pe∣ruse with unwearied Diligence the Histories both of Modern and Ancient Times, and not without good Cause: For Hi∣story is not unjustly called the Looking glass of humane Life; not only because it sheweth unto us Matters of Fact which are either commendable, or reproveable, and we behold therein that which is past, as if it were present; but also because from Things which have already happened we may learn what is best for us to do, and what we ought to avoid. And therefore great Benefit may be reaped from the Reading of Histories, besides the Pleasure which the Variety of Transactions affords to our Senses, when Matters are accompanied with singular Circumstances and unexpected Events.</P>
<P>NOW since the Reading of Historical Treatises was one of the most pleasant Diversions of my Youth, this drew me; when I attained to some Maturity of Age, to enquire after many Things that had happened in thy Kingdoms and Domi∣nions, which by many were almost forgotten. And having ga∣thered great Store of very remarkable Cases, which I thought worthy to be kept upon Record; and not buried in Oblivion, I was induced to compose an History, which for the rare Occur∣rences, and unusual Matter contained therein, I believe are not easily parallell'd.</P>
<P>AND after a long and difficult Labour, having at length finished the Work so far as to expose it to publick View; and then thinking to whom I should dedicate it, it presently came
<PB REF="003104_0003_0FEFF324B303F790"/>
into my Mind, that this could not be done more suitably to any than to the King of these Countries, which are the chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Theatre of this History; and the rather, because therein is de¦scribed the Rise of a People, who are no small Part of his faith∣ful Subjects: For so I may safely call them, since they never (how much soever wrong'd and oppress'd) offer'd any Resist∣ance to the Government: And when for Conscience sake they could not comply with what was required of them, by patient Suffering they shewed their Subjection and Obedience to the higher Power. Nay, when Opportunity was offer'd to revenge themselves; of their Enemies, even then they would not, but left it to the Lord; and thus at all Times they behaved them∣selves like a peaceable People.</P>
<P>AND since I have also had Occasion in this History to men∣tion some Illustrious Branches of thy Royal Family, to whom could I then with more Justice offer this Work, than to Thee, O King of <HI>Great Britain!</HI> Who, having already made thy self gloriously renowned by thy eminent Clemency bestowed even upon such who by their unnatural Rebellion had forfeited it, didst rather choose to establish thy Throne thereby, than by Severity, and thus effectually to observe this Lesson of the wisest of Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. xx. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Mercy and Truth preserve the King, and his Throne is upholden by Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this hath emboldened me, GREAT KING, to dedi∣cate this Work to Thee with due Regard, and in a Way of hum∣ble Address to approach thy Royal Presence. Be pleased there∣fore, according to thy wonted Goodness, to excuse this modest Freedom, and to know, that tho' it be offered by a Foreigner, yet it proceeds from him who heartily wisheth that God may Vouchsafe Thee long to reign in Peace and Tranquility over thy Subjects; and when removed hence from an earthly and pe∣rishing Diadem, to grant Thee an heavenly and incorruptible Crown of Glory.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a Labour of more them five and twenty Years, this History at length appears in publick View; to the compiling of which I was induced from the Consideration that the Rise and Encrease of that Religious Society, which in this Work I have given a circumstantial Ac∣count of, is indeed so rare and wonderful a Thing, that I think few will be met with in Modern Histories, which in the like Respect may be compared therewith; because the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called are become a great People, under such heavy Oppression as is herein after-mentioned; and that not by any human Power, or making Resistance, but meerly by an harmless Deportment, and the exercising of Patience; for the bearing of Arms, and the resisting of the Wicked by Fighting, they always have counted unlawful, and contrary to the Doctrine of our Saviour. Thus they who had no King, Prince nor Potentate to pro∣tect them, and who in the Beginning had not among themselves any Men of Renown or Literature; but relying on their Integrity, and trusting to God a∣lone, have at length triumphed over the Malice of their Opposers, by suffering, (which rose to that Degree, that it was at the Expence of the Lives of many of them) and under violent Oppression from High and Low, and the Opposition of Learned and Ʋnlearned.</P>
<P>ALL this having been searched after, and found out by assiduous Diligence it appeared so wonderful to me, that I resolved to give a Relation thereof, not∣withstanding the great Labour I soon perceived this Work required. To this may be added, that when I consider'd that several Authors, both <HI>Germans</HI> and others, had published Books and Accounts of this People, stuft with gross Ʋn∣truths, I was the more spurr'd on thereby to set down in due Order, for my Countrymens Sake, what I knew of the Matter; for it seems indeed to be of small Advantage, that when any Thing is well known to us, we keep that Know∣ledge only to our selves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scire tuam nihil e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, nisi te soire hoe s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iat alt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <HI>Pers. Sat.</HI> 1.</NOTE> without imparting it to others.</P>
<P>NOW how difficult soever I found this Labour, yet having made a Begin∣ning, I resolved to go on; and so I did, tho' often stopt by several Acci∣dents, and also other Work: For during this Labour, I have not only translated several bulky Books into <HI>Dutch,</HI> besides <HI>Kennet's Antiquities of Rome,</HI> but also composed several Treatises of Moment, and among these my <HI>Great Dictionary English and Low Dutch.</HI> And notwithstanding all these Impe∣diments, I continually resumed this Work by Intervals so often, that I have written it almost thrice to make it compleat: For doubting of some Things, and finding others defective, it made me write to <HI>England</HI> for better Information; which having gotten at length after much Pains and long Waiting, I was se∣veral Times obliged to lay aside Part of my former Description, and make a new one; which happen'd so often, that had I not been supported by an unweari∣ed Application, the Difficulty of the Labour, which hath been much greater in <HI>Holland</HI> than if I had composed the Work in <HI>England,</HI> would have made me give it over. But I went on, and so finish'd this History in that Form as it now appears.</P>
<P><PB REF="003104_0005_0FEFF32A272F43E8"/>AND I am not without Thoughts, that I was prepared to be instrumental for such a Work as this: For several remarkable Things I have made Ʋse of, I noted down before ever I thought of composing such a History; and even is my young Years, when I was in <HI>England,</HI> I copied out from Manuscripts seve∣ral Pieces and Letters, which are inserted in this History, it may be hardly to be found elsewhere.</P>
<P>AT the first Sight perhaps some will be ready to think that I might have superseded this Labour; since the learned World hath long ago seen a Book written in <HI>Latin</HI> by <HI>Gerard Croese,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Historia Quake∣riana.</HI> But be it known to the Reader, that tho' the Author got the chief Contents thereof from me, yet that Relation which he gives of the Rise and Progress of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> is very imperfect and defective; and that he presu∣med to relate Things of which he had no true Knowledge. I gave him indeed many Things in Writing; but not all I had collected; besides having since that Time written to my Acquaintance in <HI>England,</HI> I got Narratives of many re∣markable Occurrences given forth in Print there, and many Authentick Pieces in Manuscript. Now tho' this Collection was, as <HI>Ovid</HI> calleth the Chaos, <HI>Ru∣dis indigestaque Moles,</HI> [a rude and undigested Heap;] yet from thence, and from my own Collection of Matters known to me, I have compiled the greatest Part of this History: But as to the Life and Transactions of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who is largely treated of in this Work, I took them chiefly from his Journal: And the greatest Part of other Occurrences, or the Lives and Transactions of others, I have taken from the Works of deceased Authors, and out of Abun∣dance of small Books published in Print not long after the Things happened, and not contradicted by whatever I could learn.</P>
<P>THƲS I have endeavoured to assert nothing but what I had good Au∣thority for; which in regard of some Circumstances, would have been yet far more difficult after the Expiration of some Years: For now Time gave Op∣portunity to be informed of many Things, which some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancient People had yet Remembrance of, and which after their Decease perhaps should have been bu∣ried in Oblivion.</P>
<P>I CAN'T well omit here publickly to acknowledge the signal Kindness and Diligence of my well-beloved and much esteemed Friend <HI>Theodore Eccleston</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who hath furnished me with Abundance of Materials, not only very useful, but also absolutely necessary for the compiling of this Work: From him I had Intelligence on that Account, and have exchanged a Multitude of Letters. And thus by a long continued Correspondence I came to be acquainted with many Things and Circumstances, which after some Years might have been more difficult to obtain.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that I have described several Things well known to me, which few besides my self within these thirty or forty Years had better Know∣ledge of. I have also mentioned several remarkable Cases, which I noted down from the Mouths of credible Persons, who have been dead many Years ago; and thought not that at any Time I should have published them in Print. In the mean while I took Account of what seemed to me worthy to be left upon Record; and I collected a great Quantity of Books, wherein many Occurrences, mention∣ed in this <HI>History</HI> were related. Of such Kind of Relations and Accounts I have made Ʋse, without taking from thence all that was remarkable: For it hath not been for Want of Matter that this <HI>History</HI> hath not run out far her, since I could have made it thrice as big, if I had been minded so to do. But as I was unwilling to extend my Work any further than my Strength and Fealth in all Probability should permit, so I would not glut my Reader with many
<PB REF="003104_0006_0FEFF2E61D2DECC8"/>
Things of one and the same Nature; but have endeavoured by Variety of Matter, to quicken his Appetite; and therefore have intermixt the serious Part sometimes with a facetious Accident.</P>
<P>YET I have not thought my self bound to take Notice of every odd Case that may have happened among the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called: For there have conversed among them such, who acted some particular Things that were not approved of by those of that Society. And if any one swayed by human Passion commits any Excess, which is disapproved of by his Fellow-Members of the Church, such an Act may not be duly imputed to the People he makes Profession with. A∣mong such Particulars may be reckon'd the Case of one <HI>Hester Biddle,</HI> which <HI>Croese</HI> makes mention of, about the End of his History: For tho' it was told him from the Relation she gave of it at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> not with any Intention that he should publish it, yet this was a particular Case which she her self must be responsible for; since Experience hath taught that Imagination sometimes works so powerfully on the Mind, that one thinks himself obliged to do a Thing which were better left undone.</P>
<P>YET for all that it is true, that Men fearing God, may mistake, and thro' Ignorance do something, which others not without Reason might judge not com∣mendable. Also it may happen that some again from a godly Fear have act∣ed or omitted what others, no less pious, would not have scrupled. And tho' some among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the Beginning of their Rise, for Fear of trans∣gressing Christ's Command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. xxviii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Ma∣ster, even Christ,</HI> speaking to Persons in Authority, called them by the Name of <HI>Friend;</HI> yet others of the same Persuasion have not therefore thought them∣selves bound to refuse to Magistrates their distinguishing Titles of Magistracy. Nay, if any for some special Reason may not have given a full or direct An∣swer to a Query, yet others of the same Society have not look'd upon this as a Pattern to imitate. For the most eminent Valiants among this People in the Beginning were not Men of Note or Learning, tho' of great Courage, insomuch that their immoveable Stedfastness sometimes so exasperated their Enemies, that their Fear of doing or omitting any Thing which they judged would dis∣please God, often hath been stampt with the odious Denomination of Stubborn∣ness and Stiffneckedness; but they have born this patiently, believing that it was their Duty to persevere immoveably in minding their Christian Profession, and in frequenting their religious Assemblies. And that such a Stedfastness was the Duty of a Christian, seems also to have been the Judgment of the Authors of the <HI>Confession of Faith of the reformed Churches in the Ne∣therlands, Art. xxviii.</HI> where it is said, <HI>That it is the Office or Duty of all Believers, to separate themselves according to the Word of God from those that are not of the Church; and to joyn to this Congre∣gation, in what Place soever God hath placed them, tho' the Magi∣strates and Edicts of Princes were against it, and that Death, or any corporal Punishment was annex'd to it.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, there have been such among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who were exceeding bold in representing to their Enemies their evil Behaviour and Deportment: But this hath been a peculiar Talent of pious Men, of whom Examples was extant in the Books of Martyrs, <HI>viz.</HI> That some of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very plain Terms told their Persecutors of their Wickedness. Very remarkable in that Respect, is the Speech of <HI>John Molleus,</HI> who about the Year 1653, being Prisoner at <HI>Rome,</HI> without any Dissimulation, exposed to publick View the wicked Lives of the Cardinals and Bishops, who were ordered by the Pope to examime him. The like Boldness appears also in the Letter of <HI>Hans van Hoven∣dam,</HI> to the Magistrates of <HI>Ghem</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the
<PB REF="003104_0007_0FEFF32C9CD3EDB8"/>
<HI>Mirror of Martyrs of the Baptists.</HI> From whence it appears, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have not been the only People, who have told their Persecutors very boldly of their wicked Deportment and Cruelty.</P>
<P>IT can't be denied that there have been at Times, among the Society, some People of an odd Behaviour, who in Process of Time embraced strange Opinions and perverse Notions: But that's no new Thing; since this hath hap∣pened also among those of other Persuasions, tho' none of these would allow that this was the Consequence or Effect of their Doctrine. We find in Sacred Writ, that even in the Primitive Christian Church there were Apostates, either such as maintained strange Doctrine, as the <HI>Nicolaitanes,</HI> or such who finding the strait Way too narrow for them, left it, and like <HI>Demas,</HI> falling in Love again with the World, entred into the broad Way. And therefore it can now no more than then, be argued from thence, that the Exorbitances to which some launched out, were the Effects of the Doctrine they forsook.</P>
<P>SINCE in this History some Predictions are also mention'd, and that some byassed by Prejudice, will perhaps look upon them as frivolous, imagining that the <HI>Quakers</HI> pretend to have the Spirit of Prophecy; I'll answer to this, That tho' among Thousands of them there may have been One that prophetically foretold a Thing, which afterwards truly happened; yet others of that Society presumed to have that Gift, no more than to have that of being a Preacher: And all are not called to that Work. There must be Antecessors and Leaders in the religious Oeconomy, as well as in the Politick State: For if every one not qualified should assume the Office of Governing, Things would soon run into Confusion. Now tho' some have had this false Conceit, that to be able to pre∣dict future Things was a Quality the <HI>Quakers</HI> attributed to themselves, as pro∣ceeding from their Doctrine, that Christians ought to be led by the Spirit of God; yet this is a very sinister and preposterous Conceit: For what they say concerning the Leading and Guiding of the Spirit of God, is agreeable with the Doctrine of the Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. viii. 14.</NOTE> who saith, <HI>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</HI> And this was also the Doctrine of the first Reform∣ers. What must we think then of those who will not be led by this Spirit, but call this Doctrine by the odious Denomination of Enthusiasm? The same Apo∣stle tells us also,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> viii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>If any have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</HI> And he also saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xli. 7.</NOTE> <HI>The Manifestation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal.</HI> But from thence it doth in no wise follow, that the Spirit of Prophecy is given to every one; neither that altho' it might please God to reveal to One a Thing which was yet to come, such an One therefore was endued with a Prophetical Spirit, that he was able at any Time, to predict future Things.</P>
<P>IF this Position be true, then those of other Persuasions might also lay Claim to that Prerogative; because among them sometimes there have been pious Men, who predicted remarkable Things, which afterwards really happened; as amongst the rest, <HI>James Usher</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Armagh,</HI> and Primate of <HI>Ireland;</HI> who foretold the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> Forty Years before it came to pass; besides the intestine War and Miseries that befel <HI>England,</HI> and other Things that were fulfilled; which leads us not to reject as frivolous his Predic∣tion of the dreadful Persecution that would fall upon all the Protestant Churches by the <HI>Papists:</HI> For tho' one of his Friends once objected to him, That since <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> had already suffered so deeply, there was Reason to hope that the Judgments of God in respect of these Kingdoms might have been past; yet he replied to it, <HI>Fool not your selves with such Hopes; for I tell you, all you have yet seen hath been but the Beginning of Sorrows to what is yet to come upon the Protestant Churches of
<PB REF="003104_0008_0FEFF2E938519270"/>
Christ, who will ere long fall under a sharper Persecution than ever yet hath been upon them. And therefore look you be not found in the outward Court, but a Worshipper in the Temple before the Al∣tar: For Christ will measure all those that profess his Name, and call themselves his People; and the outward Worshippers he will leave out, to be trodden down by the</HI> Gentiles. <HI>The outward Court is the formal Christian, whose Religion lies in performing the Outside Du∣ties ot Christianity, without having an inward Life and Power of Faith and Love uniting them to Christ: And these God will leave to be trodden down, and swept away by the</HI> Gentiles. <HI>But the Worship∣pers within the Temple, and before the Altar, are those who do in∣deed worship God in Spirit and in Truth, whose Souls are made his Temples, and he is honoured and adored in the most inward Thoughts of their Hearts, and they sacrifice their Lusts and vile Affections, yea, and their own Wills to him: And these God will hide in the Hollow of his Hand, and under the Shadow of his Wings. And this shall be the great Difference between this last, and all the other pre∣ceeding Persecutions: For in the former, the most eminent and spiri∣tual Ministers and Christians did generally suffer most, and were most violently fallen upon; but in this last Persecution these shall be pre∣served by God as a Seed to partake of that Glory which shall imme∣diately follow, and come upon the Church, as soon as ever this Storm shall be over: For as it shall be the sharpest, so it shall be the shortest Persecution of them all, and shall only take away the gross Hypocrites and formal Professors; but the true Spiritual Believers shall be pre∣served till the Calamity be over-past.</HI></P>
<P>IF any now a-days should speak at this Rate, it's credible, that many who think themselves to be good Christians, would decry this as meer Enthusiasm. But the said Bishop is still in such great Repute with the Learned, and hath obtained such an high Esteem by his Writings, that his Words are likely to be of more Weight with many, than those of other pious Men. And therefore I was willing to renew them, and revive his Memory, if perhaps this might make form Impression upon the Minds of any: For this is a certain Truth, that no outward Performances will avail any, if they do not worship God in Spirit and in Truth; for such Worshippers God seeks, according to what our Saviour himself said:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. vii. 21, 22, 23.</NOTE> Besides, that <HI>Not every one that saith to</HI> him, <HI>Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> Nay, when many in that Day will say to him, <HI>Lord, Have we not prophesied in thy Name?</HI> He will say to them, <HI>I never knew you; Depart from me ye that work Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>AS the many singular Cases related in this History will afford no un∣pleasing Entertainment to curious Readers, so they will be found also instructive; for we shall not only meet with Instances of true Piety and Love to one's Neighbour, and of Saints triumphing on their Death-beds, and also with re∣markable Examples of Sinners truly penitent at the Hour of Death: but we may also find here Abundance of Proofs of a peaceable Behaviour: For the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, have not plotted against the Government, nor meddled with treasonable Practices or Rebellions: And how much soever they were op∣pressed, yet they always were quiet, and never made any Resistance, but with an harmless Patience they have born their most heavy Oppressions and Inju∣ries, and so it length overcame: For to be subject to Magistracy hath always been one of their Principles; and that they were really dutiful Subjects, they have shewed at all Times, by paying Obedience to the Higher Power, in all they could do with a good Conscience. And when any Thing was required of them, which from a reverential Respect to God they durst not do, or omit,
<PB REF="003104_0009_0FEFF32EF1AFBA00"/>
they have shewed their Obedience by suffering, without making any Resistance, or joining with others who were inclined thereto.</P>
<P>NOW tho' many have made it their Business to represent them in odious Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs, and to write great Ʋntruths concerning them, nay to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en Doctrines upon them which they never approved, and that not a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have contended against them with their Pens, yet among these, there have also been such, who' tho' they never joyn'd with, yet gaved a good Account and fa∣vourable Testimony concerning them; as may be seen in <HI>Richard Claridge</HI>'s Answer to a Book of <HI>Edward Cockson,</HI> pag. 266, <HI>&amp; seq.</HI> And at <HI>Amster∣dam</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> many Years ago a Learned Man published a Book called, <HI>Lucerna super Cande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abrum,</HI> wherein is very eminently defended the Doctrine of the <HI>Inward Light;</HI> and this Book was published in <HI>Dutch,</HI> and afterwards also into <HI>English</HI> with the Title of <HI>The Light upon the Candlestick;</HI> and since the Name of <HI>William Ames,</HI> a zealous Preacher among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> was placed upon the Title, many have believed him to be the Author of that Book, because his Doctrine of the Divine and Inward Light was so effectually asserted therein. That he approved the Contents of the Book I know; but I know also that it never proceeded from his Pen. And many Years afterwards it was published under the Name of one <HI>Peter Balling</HI> as the Author, tho' there were those who father'd it upon <HI>Adam Boreel,</HI> because it is found print∣ed in <HI>Latin</HI> among his <HI>Scripta Posthuma.</HI> And this Opinion it not altoge∣ther improbable; for among his Works are found also some other Writings, that contain several Positions asserted by the <HI>Quakers:</HI> Besides, he and some other of the Collegians, and among th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se also Dr. <HI>Galenus Abrahamson,</HI> were so effectually convinced of the Doctrine preached by <HI>William Ames,</HI> when he first came to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> that they approved of it; tho' after∣wards from a Misapprehension they opposed it. Now if we presuppose that <HI>Adam Boreel</HI> was the Author of the said <HI>Latin</HI> Book, <HI>Peter Balling</HI> might be the Translator thereof into <HI>Dutch;</HI> for that it was originally written in <HI>Latin,</HI> seems to me very probable.</P>
<P>BƲT however this be, it appears plainly, that the Author would not pub∣lickly be known, for the Title seemed designedly composed so, that the Readers should believe <HI>W. Ames</HI> to be the Author of it, <HI>viz. The Light on the Candlestick, serving for Illustration of the Principal Matters in the Book called,</HI> The Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, &amp;c. <HI>against</HI> Galenus Abrahamson, <HI>and his Assenters, treated of, and written by</HI> W. Ames. And this Name stood in Capital Letters underneath, in such a Manner as the Name of an Author is usually placed upon a Title tho' the Publisher meant no more, but that <HI>W. Ames</HI> was the Author of the Book called, <HI>The Mysteries of the Kingdom of God.</HI> And there was no Printer's Name added to it, but only, <HI>Printed for the Author,</HI> 1662.</P>
<P>NOW tho' I can't tell certainly who was the Author, yet I have thought fit, since the said Book is not easily to be got in <HI>Latin,</HI> to insert it in the Appendix of this History; from whence it may appear, as well as from the Writings of some others, that there have been such as either commended the <HI>Quakers,</HI> or defended their Doctrine, tho' they themselves never could resolve to joyn with them publickly.</P>
<P>BƲT notwithstanding all this, there have been others, who to render the Doctrine, the Deportment, and Carriage of the <HI>Quakers</HI> suspected and odious, have been ready to represent their honest Behaviour and religious Life as Pha∣risaical Righteousness; altho' Christ and his Apostles so earnestly recommended such a Life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 18.</NOTE> Pray what mean these Words of our Saviour, <HI>Be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perfect,

even as your Father in Heaven is perfect;</HI> but that we ought to endea∣vour to the utmost of our Power, to lead a vertuous and godly Life? When those that heard the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> preach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts ii. 37, 38.</NOTE> <HI>were</HI> thereby <HI>pricked in their Hearts, and said, Men and Brethren, what shall we do?</HI> He answered them, <HI>Repent;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts iii. 19.</NOTE> and at another Time, <HI>Repent ye, and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. xii. 2.</NOTE> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. i. 14, 15.</NOTE> agreeable to this, saith, <HI>As obedient Children, not fashioning your selves according to the former Lusts in your Ignorance: But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all Manner of Conversation.</HI> All which clearly implieth that a Christian ought to be very strict and careful in his Conversation; and of this Judgment were also the first Reformers. And that Archbishop <HI>Tillotson</HI> was also of the same M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, appears from many Passages that are to be found in his Sermons.</P>
<P>BƲT tho' the <HI>Quakers</HI> have endeavoured to make their Life and Con∣versation agree with their Christian Profession, yet this hath raised Envy, Grudge and Malice against them: And among the Clergy there have been such, who to render them odious, did not stick to represent them as disguised Papists, notwithstanding these were none of their meanest Enemies. For, after a due Reflection and Consideration, it hath seemed to me, that when King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second was on the Throne, the <HI>Romanists,</HI> and such among the <HI>Church of England</HI> as favoured them, were the cheif Promoters of Persecu∣tion. And these, to pursue their wicked Ends, would not proceed according to Law, in the Trials of imprisoned <HI>Quakers;</HI> but they continually strove to in∣troduce an arbitrary Power; and so, from Time to Time, they did not omit to prosecute the <HI>Quakers</HI> severely, thinking that when they were once suppressed, the other Dissenters must fall of Necessity, tho' they were not for Non-Resist∣ance. But Providence acted very remarkably; for when a Popish Prince af∣terwards would introduce Liberty of Conscience, the Eyes of the most moderate Maintainers of the <HI>Church of England</HI> came to be so opened, that in the Reign of King <HI>William III.</HI> they promoted a general Liberty of Conscience, by which the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> at length obtained Liberty to perform their publick Worship without Molestation.</P>
<P>THƲS far the Limits of this History are extended; and being arrived there, I did not think my self bound to enlarge any farther; what follows be∣ing no more than an Overplus.</P>
<P>I HAVE related nothing in this Work, but what I believed to be unque∣stionably true: For what seemed doubtful to me I rather choose to pass by, having never been of so credulous a Temper, as easily to take Things on Trust without due Examination: For we often see that high-soaring Imagina∣tions make People believe Things that are far from being true. But for all that, we ought not to reject as untrue every Thing that appears strange or unusual; since Experience convinceth us of the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> that sometimes we have seen a Thing, which if we had not beheld with our own Eyes, we could hardly have believed. Wherefore I would not reject as untrue what was extraordinary or unusual, when it was told me by credible Persons, or confirm∣ed by Eye-Witnesses. And therefore, tho' my Reader may meet with some very singular Occurrences, yet this is true, that I have endeavoured to the utmost to relate nothing, but what after a nice Enquiry seemed to me to be true, or at least very probable. And yet I have silently pass'd over some Cases which I did not question to be true, lest any might think me too credu∣lous.</P>
<P><PB REF="003104_0011_0FEFF3326886B1E0"/>AS to the Transactions of State-Affairs, I have taken them mostly from <HI>The History of the Rebellion and the Civil Wars in</HI> England, <HI>written by</HI> Edward <HI>Earl of</HI> Clarendon, and from the <HI>Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow:</HI> Yet some few Things relating to State-Affairs, that have not been mentioned by them, nor in any other publick History that I know of, I thought worthy to be delivered to Posterity by my Pen.</P>
<P>FOR my Stile, I know it is but indifferent: I do not pretend to Elegancy in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue; for being a Foreigner, and never having been in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> but about the Space of ten Months, and that near Fifty Years ago, it ought not to be expected that I should write <HI>English</HI> so well as <HI>Dutch,</HI> my Native Language. If therefore my Pen sometimes hath been guilty of a Belgicism, I beg Excuse of my Reader. And since my Absence hath hindred me from cor∣recting the Printer's Mistakes, either in Omissions or other Errors, such Faults I don't think my self responsible for, because I have been fain to trust the Oversight and Correction of my Work to others, who may have been more lia∣ble to let Errors escape, than my self should have been. This I hope will suf∣fice to excuse me with discreet Persons.</P>
<P>WHAT the Envious may judge of this Work I little care for, well knowing that the most eminent Authors have been exposed to Envy, and been obnoxious to the Censures of Pedantick Criticks. Whatever any may think, this I am well assured of, that my chief Scope hath been by the Relation of many unusual Oc∣currences, not only to delight my Reader, but also to lead him to Vertue. If I may be so happy as to have contributed thereto, I shall think my Pains well rewarded; and if not, I shall have at least this Satisfaction, that accord∣ing to my Ability I have endeavoured to be beneficial to others, and to ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> my Fellow-Mortals in that which is good: Which I can't but think to be well∣pleasing to God. And if I have performed any Thing that is good, the Ho∣nour and Glory thereof belongs to him, who is the Giver of all good Gifts; and it is from Him alone I have received all my Ability to do any good Thing. Thus concluding, I wish the Reader Discretion, and an impartial Judgment.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>RISE</HI> and <HI>PROGRESS</HI> OF <HI>The</HI> CHRISTIAN PEOPLE <HI>called</HI> QUAKERS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the marvelous Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> hath been small and of very little Esteem in its Beginning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1415</NOTE> and yet been ad∣vanc'd with remarkable Progress, will, I believe, be deny'd by none, that have read with Attention and a due Consideration the History of its first Rise; since God, the Beginner and Author of this glorious Work, proceeding by Steps and Degrees, hath used there∣in such singular Wisdom and Prudence, that, (every Circumstance du∣ly consider'd) instead of censuring any Part thereof, they will be ob∣lig'd to cry out <HI>Thou, O Lord, alone knowest the right Times and Seasons to open the Eyes of People, and to make them capable of thy Truth!</HI> For if we look to the first Beginnings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">J.Hus</NOTE> to go back no farther than <HI>John Hus,</HI> we shall find, that tho in many Things he was considerably enlightned, yet he remain'd still in several gross Errors; for altho' he had a clear Sight of the vain Doctrines of Purgatory, Praying to, and Wor∣shipping of Images, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nevertheless it is reported of him, that he fa∣vour'd the Invocation of Saints, the Seven Sacraments, Auricular Confession, and other Tenets of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and yet Chri∣stian Charity constrains us to believe (tho' we find Protestant Wri∣ters who deny him the Name of a Martyr) that by his Death, which he suffer d in the Flames at <HI>Constance</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> on the Sixth of the Month call'd <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1415, he hath been an acceptable Sacrifice unto God: And with what a sedate and well compos'd Mind he suffer'd Death, may be concluded from this, That he seeing a Country-Fellow very zealously carrying Wood to burn him, said, with a smiling Countenance, <HI>O holy Simplicity!</HI> and that after the Fire was kindled, he sang with Joy in the Flames, his Mind being firmly esta∣blish'd on God; for he had been faithful according to his Knowledge, and had not hid his Talent in the Earth, but improv'd it, having shewn himself a zealous Promoter of that small Illumination which God was pleas'd to grant him; it being, without Question, great enough in that grievous Night of Darkness, when Idolatry had so universally blinded Mankind, that morally speaking, it would have been impossible for them to have understood the Declaration of an entirely reform'd Re∣ligion; whereas it is evident that the most sober and discreet People of that Age were capable to understand the Doctrine and Sermons of that honest Man.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003104_0013_0FEFF3356D2ADDC0"/>To give a clearer Prospect into this Matter, let it be consider'd, that if a Man had been kept shut up a long Time in a dark Prison, where he could neither behold the Light of the Sun or Moon, and should have been let out on a sudden at clear Noon-Day, he would not only not be able to endure the bright Day-Light, but would also, if he strove to open his Eyes with Force, be endanger'd of losing, his Sight, and fal∣ling into a worse Condition than he was in before; whereas if he had been brought into the open Air at the Time of Twilight, he would by Degrees have learned to discern the Objects, and come to an Ability of beholding every Thing in a clear Day aright.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this, in the Reigns of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth and the bloody Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the principal Test in <HI>England</HI> was, Whether a Man owned the Corporal Presence of Christ in the Sacrament; and he who denied this, was to be burnt as an Heretick; also in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> 'twas enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bring a Man to the Stake, if he confessed that he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-baptized. Insomuch that it seems the Lord did raise in those Days zealous Men chiefly to testify against the Idolatry of the Host and the Error of Infan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Baptism, that so gradually he might break down the great Structure of humane Inventions.</P>
<P>Now how small foever the Beginnings of this great Work of Refor∣mation were, yet it encreas'd from time to time, and oftentimes singular Instances were seen of the Workings of the Power and Spirit of God.</P>
<P>In the Year 1513,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1513 J. Le Clerc.</NOTE> I find that one <HI>John Le Clerc</HI> of <HI>Meaux</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> being at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tz</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> was fill'd with such Zeal against Idolatry, that he broke to pieces the Images in a Chappel, which the next Day were to have been worshipped in a very solemn Manner. And being ta∣ken Prisoner for this Fact, and cruelly tortur'd to Death, he was so eminently strengthened, even to the Amazement of the Beholders, that in the Height of the Torments, being torn with red hot Pincers, he said from <HI>Psalm</HI> cxv. <HI>Their Idols are Silver and Gold, the Work of Mens Hands.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aymond a Vie.</NOTE> Not less was the Zeal of one <HI>Aymond a Vie,</HI> imprison'd in <HI>France,</HI> about the Year 1541,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1541</NOTE> because he had preach'd the Gospel un∣dauntedly; and tho' he had been advised to fly, yet he would not be persuaded thereto, but said with an heroick Mind, <HI>I would rather never have been born than commit such a base Act; for it is the Duty of a good Pastor not to fly from Danger but to stay in it, lest the Sheep be scattered.</HI> He was tortur'd cruelly to betray his Fellow-Believers; but no Torment, how cruel soever, could extort the Name of any from him; and he suffer'd Death valiantly for the Testimony of Jesus, feeling himself very powerfully strengthned by the Spirit of God, which work'd so gloriously in the Martyrs of those Times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merindol</NOTE> that those of <HI>Merindol</HI> in <HI>Provence</HI> said, <HI>The Holy Ghost is an infallible Teacher, by whose Inspiration all Christians receive the Knowledge of Truth: This Spirit dwells in them, he rege∣nerates them to a new Life, he slayeth the Old Man in them, and he makes them alive to every good Work, consolating them in Tribulations, and strength∣ening them in Adversities,</HI> &amp;c. And of the pious Professors at <HI>Meaux,</HI> I find mention'd in the Year 1546,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1546</NOTE> that tho' a great Number of Men and Women were led Prisoners by but a few, they yet made no Re∣sistance, but shew'd themselves harmless, not sad with Grief, but singing with Joy; nay, so powerfully God did work in <HI>Gabriel Beraudin,</HI> who was executed at <HI>Chambery</HI> in <HI>Savoy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1550</NOTE> in the Year 1550, that after his Tongue was cut off by the Hangman, he spoke intelligibly to the Peo∣ple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claude Mo∣rier.</NOTE> and celebrated God's Praise in a miraculous Manner. <HI>Claude Morier</HI> being burnt very cruelly at <HI>Lions</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> wrote whilst in his Prison, <HI>Let us pray our Heavenly Father continually, that he create in us a clean Heart, that he give us a new Heart, and that he guide our Will by the Leadings of

his Spirit.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Godfried de Hammelle.</NOTE> Very re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ble it is also, that <HI>Godfried de Hammelle</HI> a Year after that, being imprision'd at <HI>Tournay</HI> in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and being told that the Apostle in his Epistle to the <HI>Ephesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1551</NOTE> had call d Marriage a Sa∣crament, said in a Letter, <Q>That tho' at first this had puzzled him, yet the Lord had not long left him in this Difficulty, but put him in Mind by his Spirit, that the Word there was not <HI>Sacrament,</HI> but <HI>My∣stery.</HI></Q> For the Martyrs of those Times did not stick to profess with the primitive Christians, that the Children of God must be led by his Spirit. And so <HI>Peter Schryver,</HI> burnt at <HI>Lions,</HI> about the Year 1552,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1552 P.Schryver</NOTE> wrote from Prison, <Q>That he having heard God's pure Word preach'd, believ'd it,</Q> because the Spirit of God gave him a Testimony [or Evidence] of it in his Heart, and did so confirm it to him, that he "could not question it in the least." He also says in his Letter, <Q>That once having pray'd to God, he had been so refresh'd by the Vertue of his Spirit, and so strengthned, that tho' he sate in a dark nasty Place, yet he felt such a Consolation and Joy, that overcame all Sorrow and Anguish. Nay, said he, the least Comfort and Joy I feel now in my Bends, surpasseth all the Joys that ever I had in my Life; for now the Holy Ghost puts me in Mind of those gracious Promises that are made to those who suffer for his Name's-sake.</Q> And being ask'd how he knew that which he asserted, to be the pure Word of God? He answer'd, <HI>Because it did agree with the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apo∣stles, and that of Jesus Christ; and that the Holy Ghost gave him a certain Evidence thereof.</HI> Concerning the Indwelling of God s Spirit in Man, he also speaks very notably in his Letter to <HI>John Chambon,</HI> (whose won∣derful Conversion in Prison was an eminent Proof of the Truth of his Sayings) telling him, <HI>That his Heavenly Father was near him, and by his Spirit dwelt in his Heart.</HI> That this was also the Doctrine of <HI>John Cal∣vin,</HI> appears from his Letters to the said Man and his Fellow-Prisoners, where he saith: <Q>Don't doubt but God will, in those Things wherein he will use your Service, give you that Power, by which the Work in you being begun, will be perfected, for that he hath promised to do: And we have many Examples and Instances of that excellent Faith, by which we clearly know, that God never in any Thing hath fail∣ed those who have been led and guided by his Spirit. Trust firmly, Brethren, that when it is needful you will become so strong and sted∣fast, that you shall not faint under any Burden of Temptations, how great and heavy soever. — The Fight is now at hand, to which the Holy Ghost exhorts us, not only that we should go, but even that with all Alacrity of Mind we should run.</Q> Many other excellent Testimonies of eminent Men of those Times might be produc'd: And it also is very remarkable that <HI>Peter Bergier</HI> being Prisoner at <HI>Lions,</HI> in the Year 1553,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1553 P. Bergier</NOTE> and afterwards suffering Death, cry'd in the midst of the Flames, <HI>I see the Heavens open'd.</HI> Now that the Doctrine of <HI>being taught by the Spirit of God,</HI> was generally receiv'd by the Martyrs of those Times, we learn from many of their Writings. <HI>Denis Peloquin</HI> burnt in the said Year at <HI>Ville Franche,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Denis Pelo∣quin.</NOTE> said in his Confession, <HI>That it was the Holy Ghost that gave him Witness in his Conscience, that the Books of the Old and New Testament were the Holy Scripture. Lewis de Marsac,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lewis de Marsac.</NOTE> being about the same Time put to Death by Fire at <HI>Lions,</HI> said, when he was ask'd how he knew the Holy Scriptures to be the Gospel? <HI>God hath taught me so by his Spirit:</HI> And being also ask'd, Whether it was his incumbent Duty to read the Holy Scriptures, and who had instructed him concern∣ing them? He answer'd, <HI>That God by his Spirit had effected it, that he got some Knowledge thereof; and that without his Grace, and the enlightning of his Spirit, he could not comprehend and understand any Thing in the Gospel. John
<PB N="4" REF="003104_0015_0FEFF3391A189E48"/>
Calvin</HI> did also write to the aforesaid <HI>Peloquin and Marsac: God will cause that the Confession which you will make according to the Measure of the Spirit he has given you, will produce a greater Fruit of Edification than all others that might be sent you.</HI> And to <HI>Matthew Dymonet,</HI> Prisoner at <HI>Lyons,</HI> he wrote thus; <Q>Submit modestly to the Guidings of God's Spirit; answer with all Moderation and Discretion, keeping to the Rule of the Scriptures. I have believed, and therefore I will speak; but let not this hinder thee to speak freely and sincerely, being persuaded that he who pro∣mis'd to give us a Mouth, and such Wisdom as the Gainsayers can't withstand, will never forsake thee.</Q> More of the like Instances of the Operations of the Spirit of God in his Witnesses I could alledge, if I had so intended; but I give here only a slender Draught of the Since∣rity and the Principle of those that were but come to the Dawnings of the Reformation; for higher I can't esteem that Time, because the Eyes of the most zealous Men of those Days were yet so much cover'd with the Fogs which then were, and the Prejudice of the old Leaven, that they did not discern all Things in a full Clearness; for one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw the Error of one Thing, and the other of another; but humane Affection did work too strong, and thereby they judged one another, as is abun∣dantly mentioned in History.</P>
<P>If we rightly look into this, it seems very absurd to think that the Reformation (which in former Times had been pretty much advanced by some eminent Men; as <HI>Luther, Melancthon, Oecolompadius, Calvin, Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI> and others) then was brought to Perfection; for we perceive that even those Reformers themselves at first had not such a clear Sight into ma∣ny Things, as afterwards they got; which to demonstrate at large, I count unnecessary; since <HI>England</HI> being the chiefest Stage, on which the Things I intend to describe, have been transacted, I'll turn, my Face thi∣therward, to take a View cursorily of the Beginning and Process of the Reformation there. Passing by <HI>Wickliff</HI> and others, I begin with <HI>Thomas Cranmer;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Cranmer.</NOTE> who, because of his sincere and good Life, being advanced by King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth to the Archbishop's See of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> did all that was in his Power to reform the Errors crept into the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1536</NOTE> and therefore in the Year 1536, he exhorted the King, who much loved him, to proceed to a Reformation, and that nothing in Religion should be determined without clear Proofs from Scripture, and there∣fore he proposed that these Points, <Q>Whether there was a Purgatory? Whether deceased Saints ought to be invocated? and how Images were to be regarded;</Q> well needed to be enquired into; since it began to appear, that several Things were Errors, for which some People not long before had suffer'd Death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">T.Cromwel.</NOTE> Some Time after, <HI>Thomas Cromwel,</HI> a chief Minister of the Kingdom, and a great Friend of <HI>Cranmer,</HI> publish'd some Injunctions in the King's Name, wherein all Churchmen were re∣quir'd, no more to recommend to People, Images, Relicks, or Pilgri∣mages, but to teach them the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments in <HI>English.</HI> This was a great Step towards the Translation of the Bible into <HI>English,</HI> which being also further'd by <HI>Cranmer,</HI> the next Year came out in Print;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1537</NOTE> and by the King's Warrant, the Clergy were requir'd to set up Bibles it their Churches; so that now, all that could might read the Holy Scripture in their native Tongue. <HI>Cranmer</HI> not content with this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1539</NOTE> obtain'd in the Year 1539, a Permission for all People to have the Bible in their Houses; yet for all that, he still was an As∣sertor of the corporal Presence of Christ in the Host, until in the Year 1549,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1549 N.Ridley.</NOTE> in the Reign of King <HI>Edward VI.</HI> when the Times were more free, he was induc'd by <HI>Nicholas Ridley,</HI> a zealous Reformer, and afterwards a Martyr under Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> to enquire better into the Thing, and to discover
<PB N="5" REF="003104_0016_0FEFF2F36FC88F28"/>
cover the Absurdity of it; from whence he did not only oppose and sup∣pres that Superstition, but also many others; and it is likely, that if Opportunity had been given him, he would have reformed more Things. Nevertheless, it can't but be wondred at, that he who seems to have been a Man of a meek Temper, could give his Vote for the Burning of those whom he look'd upon to be Hereticks; as <HI>John Nicholson,</HI> alias <HI>Lambert,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. for denying of the corporal Presence of Christ in the Sacrament; and <HI>Joan Bocher</HI> and <HI>George Parr</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> VI. the first for denying that Christ had taken Flesh from the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the latter for not believing the Deity of Christ: From whence we may see what a wrong Zeal for Religion is able to effect: But without que∣stion he was become of another Mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1556</NOTE> when in the Year 1556, under the bloody Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> this was not only laid in his Dish, but he also was forc'd to undergo the same Lot of being burnt alive.</P>
<P>Now tho' after his Death the Bishops under Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> were content with the Reformation made by <HI>Cranmer,</HI> yet it pleased God in the Year 1568,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568</NOTE> to raise other Persons that testify'd publickly against many of the remaining Superstitions; and altho' <HI>Coleman, Burton, Hal∣lingham,</HI> and <HI>Benson,</HI> were imprison'd by the Queen's Order, yet they got many Followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puritans.</NOTE> and also the Name of Puritans. And notwithstanding the Archbishop, to prevent this, drew up some Articles of Faith, to be sign'd by all Clergymen, yet he met with great Opposition in this Under∣taking: For one <HI>Robert Brown,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Robt. Brown.</NOTE> a young Student of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> (from whom the Name of <HI>Brownists</HI> was afterwards borrowed) and <HI>Richard Harrison,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Harrison.</NOTE> a School-Master,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1583</NOTE> publish'd in the Year 1583 some Books, wherein they shew'd how much the Church of <HI>England</HI> was still infected with <HI>Romish</HI> Errors; which was of such Effect, that the Eyes of many People came thereby to be open'd; who so valiantly maintain'd that Doctrine which they believ'd to be the Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593 H.Barrow. J. Green∣wood, J. Pen∣ry.</NOTE> that some of the most zealous among them, viz. <HI>Henry Barrow, John Greenwood,</HI> and <HI>John Penry,</HI> about the Year 1593 were put to Death because of their Testimony, more (as may very well be believ'd) by the Instigation of the Clergy, than by the De∣sire of the Queen: For some time after it happen'd that she ask'd Dr. <HI>Raynolds</HI> his Opinion of those Men, especially <HI>Barrow</HI> and <HI>Greenwood:</HI> To which he answer'd, <HI>That it would not avail any Thing to shew his Judgment concerning them, seeing they were put to Death.</HI> But the Queen yet pres∣sing him farther, he said, <HI>That he was persuaded if they had liv'd, they would have been two as worthy Instruments for the Church of God, as had been rais'd up in that Age.</HI> At which the Queen sigh'd, and said no more. But afterwards riding by the Place where they were executed, and calling to Mind their Death, she demanded of the Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> that was present when they suffer'd, What End they made? And he answer'd, <HI>A very godly End; and they prayed for your Majesty and the State.</HI> Moreover one <HI>Philips,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philips.</NOTE> a famous Preacher, having seen <HI>Barrow</HI>'s Prepa∣ration for Death, said, Barrow, Barrow, <HI>my Soul be with thine.</HI></P>
<P>After the Death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when <HI>James</HI> I. had ascended the Throne, the Followers of those Men suffer'd much for their Sepa∣ration from the Church of <HI>England:</HI> But very remarkable it is, that even those of that Persuasion, of which many in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. went to <HI>New-England,</HI> to avoid the Persecution of the Bishops, after∣wards themselves turn'd cruel Persecutors of pious People, by inhumane Whippings, <HI>&amp;c</HI> and lastly by putting some to Death by the Hands of a Hangman: A clear Proof indeed, that those in whom such a Ground of Bitterness was left still, tho' it had not always brought forth the like abominable Fruits, were not come yet to a perfect Reformation; for tho' the Stem of humane Traditions and Institutions sometimes had been

shaken strongly, yet much of the Root was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Therefore it pleased God, who is used to enlighten Men gradually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make yet a clearer Discovery of his Truth, which in some Places already darted forth its Beams to Mankind, in a Time when many godly People were zealously seeking after a farther Manifestation of the Will of God, from a Sense that, notwithstanding all their outward Observations of religious Per∣formances, there still stood a Partition-Wall, whereby the Soul was hin∣dered from living in perfect Peace with its Creator. For in that Time there were in <HI>England</HI> many separate Societies, and amongst the rest also such as were called <HI>Seekers,</HI> who at first seemed to promise great Mat∣ters; but the Sequel shewed that their Foundation was not the Rock of Ages; and so divers of them soon lost their first Integrity. Now those People who began to take Heed to a divine Conviction in the Consci∣ence, and accordingly preach'd to others the Doctrine of an inward Light, wherewith Christ had enlightened Men, in the latter End of the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. began to encrease in Number, and they be∣came a separate Society among Men, and in Process of Time the Name of <HI>QƲAKERS</HI> was in Scorn imposed on them; and in most Coun∣tries of <HI>Europe</HI> they have been accused of many exorbitant. Absurdities, both in Life and Doctrine. I have design'd to describe impartially, and according to Truth, the first Beginnings and Rise, and also the Progress of that People, and to stretch out the Relation of their Increase and Transactions so far as my Time of Life and Leisure will permit.</P>
<P>I enter upon a W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which, consisting of many very singular Instances, in its Beginning appears hard and difficult, and in the Process often sad and dreadful. For among the manifold Adversities, we shall not only meet with bitter Revilings, scornful Mockings, rude Abuses, and bloody Blows from the fool-hardy Rabble, but also severe Persecutions, hard Imprisonments, grievous Banishments, unmerciful Spoil of Goods, cruel Whippings, Cutting off of Ears, Smotherings in Prisons, and also putting to Death by the Hands of an Hangman, by Order of the Magistrates: Afterwards some Quiet and Rest; then again severe Persecution, until the furious Promoters of it, at last wearied, desisted from their mischie∣vous Labour for a Time, more by being at their Wits-end, than out of Mercy. And among all these Vicissitudes, notable Instances have been seen of unfeigned Godliness, sincere Love, much True-heartedness, ex∣traordinary Meekness, singular Patience, ardent Zeal, undaunted Courage, and unshaken Stedfastness, even among the Female Sex, which tho' the weakest, yet in the hardest Attacks shew'd a more than manly Spirit; insomuch, that seldom any Age hath afforded Matter where more pow∣erful Examples to Vertue have been seen. The first I find that was thus immediately reach'd in his Mind, was a young Man call'd <HI>George Fox,</HI> born at <HI>Drayton</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">George Fox.</NOTE> in <HI>England,</HI> in the Month call'd <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1624, from Parents that were Members of the publick Church, or Church of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Drayton. 1624 Leicestersh.</NOTE> as appeareth to me from a Paper, in his Life∣time drawn up by his Order, at my Request, and sent me. His Father was <HI>Christopher Fox,</HI> a Weaver by Trade, an honest Man, and of such a vertuous Life, that his Neighbours were used to call him <HI>Righteous Christer.</HI> His Mother was <HI>Mary Lago,</HI> an upright Woman, and of the Stock of the Martyrs. This <HI>George Fox</HI> was even in his Minority en∣dued with a Gravity and Stayedness of Mind, that is seldom seen in Children; so that he seeing how old People carried themselves lightly and wantonly, had such an Aversion to it, that he would say within himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1641 <HI>Geo. Fox</HI>'s Journal, <HI>p.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>If ever I come to be a Man, surely I will not be so wanton.</HI></P>
<P>His Parents in the mean while endeavour'd to train him up, as they did their other Children, in the common Way of Worship, his Mother
<PB N="7" REF="003104_0018_0FEFF2F692097A38"/>
especially contributing thereto, as being eminent for Piety: But even from a Child he was seen to be of another Frame of Mind than his B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethren; for he was more religious, retired, still, and solid, and was also observing beyond his Age, as appeared from the Answers he gave, and the Questions he asked concerning religious Matters, to the Astonishment of those that heard him. His Mother seeing this extraordinary Temper and Godliness which so early did shine thro' him, so that he would not meddle with childish Plays, did not think it fit to trouble him about the Way of Worship, but carried herself indulgent towards him. Mean while he learned to read pretty well, and to write so much as would serve him af∣terwards to signify his Meaning to others. When he was come to eleven Years of Age, he endeavour'd to live a pure and righteous Life, and to be faithful in all Things, <HI>viz.</HI> inwardly to God, and outwardly to Man; since the Lord by his good Spirit had shewed him, that he was to keep his Word always, and that he ought not to commit Excess in eating or drinking. He thus growing up in Vertue, some of his Relations were for having him train'd up in the Schools, make a Priest of him; but others persuaded to the contrary; and so he was put to a Shoe-maker that dealt also in Wool and in Cattle. Being employ'd then by his Master, he took most Delight in Sheep, and was very skilful in what belong'd thereto, for it was an Imployment that very well suited his Mind; and his thus being a Shepherd, was, as an eminent Author saith, a just Emblem of his after Ministry and Service. He did acquit himself so diligently in his business, and minded it so well, that his Master was succesful in his Trade whilst <HI>George</HI> was with him. He often used in his Dealings the Word <HI>verily,</HI> and then he kept so strict to it, that People that knew him would, say, <HI>If</HI> George <HI>says</HI> verily, <HI>there is no altering him.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' my Design is not to give a Description of State-Affairs, yet I find it necessary to mention something of the chief temporal Occur∣rence in <HI>England,</HI> in as much as they may have Relation to the Affairs of the Church; lest my History might seem an incompleat Work. Tran∣siently therefore I will say, that in <HI>England</HI> about this Time appeared the Beginnings of a Civil War, in which Religion had some Share; for the Bishops began to introduce several Innovations, and caused not only Rails to be made about the Communion-Table, which now was called the High Altar; but those that approached it bowed thrice, and a Bow was made at the Pronouncing of the Name of <HI>Jesus.</HI> Thus Ceremonies increased from Time to Time; and those Preachers that were really religi∣ous, and spoke most to Edification, were slighted and set by; the Bishops, in their Visitations, minding chiefly to promote such Rites as favoured Popery. And this was not only done in <HI>England,</HI> but in <HI>Scotland</HI> also Endeavours were made to bring in Episcopacy. This caused a Ferment among the People, which when it came to an Insurrection, they gene∣rally believed that it was for Religion's-Sake, which made some cry in the open Streets, where there was any Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uence of People, <HI>To your Tent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, O Israel.</HI> And because the Parliament was of Opinion that King <HI>Charles</HI> I. encroach'd upon their Privileges, which they would not suffer; this so exasperated that Prince, that he brought together an Army and set up his Standard, first on the Castle of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> where it was blown down the same Evening, on the 25th of the Month call'd <HI>August</HI> in the Year 1642.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1642</NOTE> But before that Time, the King had taken Possession of some fortify'd Places, and the Parliament on the other hand had also got some in their Power. Some time after a Battle was sought between the Roy∣ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and the Parliament, near <HI>Edge-Hill in Warwickshire,</HI> where neither Party prevailed much. About this Time <HI>George Fox,</HI> who more and more endeavour'd to lead a godly Life, being come to the nineteenth

Year of his Age, it happen'd at a Fair, that a Cousin of his and ano∣ther coming to him, asked whether he would drink a Jugg of Beer with them? He being thirsty, said <HI>Yes,</HI> and went with them to an Inn: But after each had drank a Glass, they began to drink Healths, and said, that <HI>He that would not drink, should pay for all.</HI> This grieved <HI>George</HI> much, seeing that People who professed to be religious, beha∣ved themselves thus, and therefore he rose up to be gone; and put∣ting his Hand into his Pocket, he took a Groat, and laid it down upon the Table, saying, <HI>If it be so, I ll leave you;</HI> and so he went away; and when his Business was done, he returned home; but did not go to Bed, that Night, but prayed and cryed earnestly to the Lord; and it seemed to him that his Supplications were answered after this Manner, <HI>Thou seest how young People go together into Vanity, and old People into the Earth; therefore thou must forsake all, both Young and Old, and be as a Stranger to them.</HI> This, which he took to be a Divine Admoniti∣on, made such a powerful Impression on his Mind, that he resolved to break off all familiar Fellowship and Conversation with Young and Old, and even to leave his Relations, and to live a separate and retir'd Live.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1643</NOTE> On the ninth of <HI>September,</HI> in the Year 1643, he departed to <HI>Lutterworth,</HI> where he stay'd some Time, and from thence went to <HI>North∣ampton,</HI> where he also made some Stay, and then passed to <HI>Newport-Pagnel</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire;</HI> and after having stay'd a while there, he went to <HI>Barnet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1644</NOTE> whither he came in the Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h called <HI>June</HI> in the Year 1644.</P>
<P>Whilst he led thus a solitary Lite, he fasted often, and read the Holy Scriptures diligently, so that some Professors took Notice of him, and sought to be acquainted with him. But he soon perceiving they did not possess what they profess d, grew afraid of them, and shun'd their Com∣pany. In this time he fell into a strong Temptation, almost to Despair, and was in mighty Trouble, sometimes keeping himself retir'd in his Chamber, and often walking solitarily to want upon the Lord. In this State he saw how Christ had been tempted; but when he look'd to his own Condition, he wondered, and said, <HI>Was I ever so before.</HI> He began to think also that he had done amiss against his Relations, because he had forsaken them; and he called to Mind all his former Time, to consider whether he had wrong'd any. Thus Temptations grew more and more; and when Satan could not effect his Design upon him that Way, he laid Snares for him to draw him to commit some Sin, thereby to bring him to Despair. He was then about twenty Years of Age, and continu'd a long while in this Condition, and would fain have put it from him; which made him go to many a Priest to look for Comfort, but he did not find it from them. In this miserable State he went to <HI>London,</HI> in Hopes or finding some Relief among the great Professors of that City: But be∣ing come there, he saw them much darkned in their Understandings. He had an Uncle there, one <HI>Pickering,</HI> a <HI>Baptist,</HI> and those of that Per∣suasion were tender then; yet he could not resolve to impart his Mind to them, or join with them, because he saw all, Young and Old, where they were. And tho' some of the best would have had him staid there, yet he was fearful, and so return'd homewards; for having understood that his Parents and Relations were troubled at his Absence, he would rather go to them again l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st he should grieve them. Now when he was come into <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> his Relations would have had him marry'd; but he prudently told them, <HI>He was but a Lad, and must get Wisdom.</HI> Others would have had him in the Auxiliary B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd among the Forces of the Par∣liament, which being enter'd now into an intestine War with the King, had, with their Forces this Year, beaten not only the King's Army under Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> but also conquer'd the City of <HI>York.</HI> But to persuade
<PB N="9" REF="003104_0020_0FEFF2F8D48F9C60"/>
<HI>George</HI> to list himself a Soldier, was so against his Mind, that he refused i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> went to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ntry</HI> where he look a Chamber for a while at a Pro∣fessors House, where he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid some Time, there being many People in that Town who endeavour d to live religiously.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1645</NOTE> After some time he went into his own Country again, and was there about a Year, in great Sorrows and Trouble, walking many Nights by himself. Then <HI>Nathaniel Stevens,</HI> the Priest of <HI>Drayton,</HI> (the Town of <HI>George</HI>'s Birth) would often come to him, and <HI>George</HI> to the Priest; and when <HI>Stevens</HI> visited him he would sometimes bring another Priest along with him, and then <HI>George Fox</HI> would ask them Questions, and did reason with them. Once <HI>Stevens</HI> ask d him, <HI>Why Christ cry d out upon the Cross, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> And why he said, <HI>If it be possible let this Cup pass from me; yet not my Will, but thine be done?</HI> To this <HI>George Fox</HI> answer d thus; <Q>At that Time the Sins of all Mankind were upon Christ, and their Iniquities and Transgressions with which he was wounded, which he was to bear, and to be an Offering for them, as he was Man, but died not as he was God: And so, in that he died for all Men, and tasted Death for every Man, he was an Offering for the Sins of the whole World.</Q> When <HI>George Fox</HI> spoke this, he was in a Measure sensible of Christ's Sufferings, and what he went through. And his saying so, did so please the Priest, that he said, <HI>It was a very good full An∣swer, and such an one as he had not heard.</HI> He would also applaud and speak highly of <HI>George Fox</HI> to others, and what <HI>George</HI> said in Discourse to him, that he would preach of on the First Days of the Week: For which <HI>George</HI> did not like him. After some Time he went to an ancient Priest at <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>setter</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> and reasoned with him about the Ground of Despair and Temptations; but he being altogether ignorant of <HI>George</HI>'s Condition, bid him take Tobacco, and sing <HI>Psalms.</HI> But <HI>George</HI> signified that he was no Lover of Tobacco, and as for <HI>Psalms,</HI> he was not in a State to sing. Then the Priest bid him come again, and that then he would tell him many Things. But when <HI>George</HI> came, the Priest was angry and pettish, for <HI>George</HI>'s former Words had displeased him; and he was so indiscreet, that what <HI>George Fox</HI> had told him of his Sor∣rows and Griefs, he told again to his Servants, so that it got among the Milk-Lasses; which grieved him to have opened his Mind to such an one; and he saw they were all miserable Comforters. Then he heard of a Priest living about <HI>Tamworth,</HI> who was accounted an experienced Man, and therefore he went to him, but found him like an empty hollow Cask. Hearing afterwards of one Dr. <HI>Craddock</HI> of <HI>Coventry,</HI> he went to him also, and asked him whence Temptations and Despair did arise, and how Troubles came to be wrought in Man. The Priest, instead of answer∣ing, ask'd him, <HI>Who was Christ's Father and Mother?</HI> And <HI>George</HI> told him, Mary <HI>was his Mother, and he was supposed to be the Son of</HI> Joseph, <HI>but he was the Son of God.</HI> Now as they were walking together in Dr. <HI>Craddock</HI>'s Garden, it happen'd that <HI>George</HI> in turning, set his Foot on the Side of a Bed, which so disturbed that Teacher, as if his House had been on Fire, and thus all their Discourse was lost; and <HI>George Fox</HI> went away in Sorrow, worse than he was when he came, seeing he found none that could reach his Condition. After this he went to one <HI>Macham,</HI> a Priest of high Account; and he, no more skilful than the others, was for gi∣ving <HI>George</HI> some Physick and for bleeding him; but they could not get one Drop of Blood from him, either in the Arms or the Head, his Body being, as it were, dried up with Sorrows, Grief, and Trouble, which were so great upon him, that he could have wished never to have been born, to behold the Vanity and Wickedness of Men; or that he had been born blind, and so he might never have seen it; and deaf,
<PB N="10" REF="003104_0021_0FEFF340A27B6098"/>
that he might never have heard vain and wicked Words, or the Lord's Name blasphemed. And when the Time called <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mas</HI> came, while others were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easting and sporting themselves, he went from House to House, looking, for p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Widows, and giving them some Money. And when he was invi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to Marriages (as sometimes he was) he would go to none at all; but the, next Day, or soon after, he went and visited those that were newly married; and if they were poor, he gave them some Money; for he had wherewith both to keep himself from being chargeable to others, and to administer something to the needful.</P>
<P>Whilst the Mind of <HI>George Fox</HI> was thus in Trouble, the State of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> was also in a great Stir; for the Parliament was for turning out of Bishops, and introducing the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Directory; which however as yet could not well be effected, altho' <HI>William Laud,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> had been made to stoop to the Block; and the Power of the King by this Time was much weaken'd; for his Army was this Summer near <HI>Naseby,</HI> not far from <HI>Leicester,</HI> overcome by an Army of untrain d Bands, and about six Thousand Men, among which many great Officers were taken Prisoners, and his Cabinet, with abundance of Letters of great Moment, was seiz'd; insomuch, that tho' some Skirmishes were held, yet no decisive Battle was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought afterwards.</P>
<P>But since a circumstantial Description of these State-Affairs is not with∣in my Design, I ll return again to <HI>George Fox,</HI> who in the Beginning of the Year 1646,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1646</NOTE> as he was going to <HI>Coventry,</HI> and entring, towards the Gate, a Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ideration arose in him, how it was said, that <HI>All Christians are Believers,</HI> both Protestants and Papists: And it was opened to him, that if all were Believers, then they were all born of God, and passed from Death to Life, and that none were true Believers but such: And tho' others said they were Believers, yet they were not. At ano∣ther Time as he was walking in a Field on a First Day Morning, it was discover d unto his Understanding, that <HI>to be bred at</HI> Oxford, <HI>or</HI> Cambridge <HI>was not enough to make a Man to be a Minister of Christ.</HI> At this he won∣der d, because it was the common Belief of People; but for all that, he took this to be a divine Revelation, and he admir d the Goodness of the Lord, believing now the ordinary Ministers not to be such as they pre∣tended to be. This made him unwilling to go any more to Church, as it was called, to hear the Priest <HI>Stevens,</HI> believing that he could not pro∣fit thereby: And therefore instead of going there, he would get into the Orchard, or the Fields, by himself with his Bible, which he esteemed above all Books, seeking thus to be edified in Solitariness. At this his Relations were much troubled: But he told them, <HI>Did not</HI> John <HI>the Apo∣stle say to the Believers, that they needed no Man to teach them, but as the A∣nointing teacheth them?</HI> And tho' they knew this to be Scripture, and that it was true, yet it grieved them, because he would not go to hear the Priest with them, but separated himself from their Way of Worship: For he saw now, that a true Believer was another Thing than they looked upon it to be; and that being bred at the Universities did not qualify a Man to be a Minister of Christ. Thus he lived by himself, not joining with any; nay, not of the Dissenting People, but became a Stranger to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Sometime after it was opened in him, <HI>That God, who made the World, did not dwell in Temples made with Hands.</HI> And tho' this seemed at first strange to him, because both Priests and People used to call their Churches <HI>Dreadful Places, Holy Ground, and Temples of God,</HI> yet it was immediately shew'd him, that the Lord did not dwell in these Temples which Man had erected, but in People's Hearts, and that his People were the Temple he dwelt in. This was discover'd to him when he was walk∣ing
<PB N="11" REF="003104_0022_0FEFF2FB54CCFF38"/>
in the Fields to the House of one of his Relations. And when he came the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, it was told him, that <HI>Nathaniel Stevens,</HI> the Priest, had been there, and told them, he was afraid of <HI>Fox,</HI> for going after new Lights. This made him smile, because now he saw the true State of the Priests. But he said nothing of it to his Relations, who tho' they saw that some∣thing more was requir'd than the vulgar Way of Worship, yet they con∣tinu d therein, being grieved because he would not also go to hear the Priests. Only he told them there was an Anointing in Man, to reach him; and that the Lord would teach his People himself. He had great Open∣ings now concerning the Things written in the Revelations; and when he spake of them, the Priests and Professors would say, That was <HI>a sealed up Book.</HI> But to this he said, <Q>Christ could open the Seals; and that the Things contain d in that Book, very nearly concern'd us; since the Epistles of the Apostles were written to the Saints of those Times, but the Revelations to point at Things to come.</Q> In <HI>England</HI> in those Days were People of very odd Notions, and among the rest such as held, <HI>that Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n have no Souls.</HI> He lighting on some of these, could not for∣bear reproving them, since the Scripture, as he told them plainly, held forth the contrary; for the blessed <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> said, <HI>My Soul doth mag∣nify the Lord; and my Spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</HI> He also came among a People that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly d much on Dreams; but he told them, <Q>Ex∣cept they could distinguish between Dream and Dream, their Obser∣vations would be nothing but Confusion, since there were three Sorts of Dreams; for Multiplicity of Business sometimes caused Dreams; and there were Whisperings of Satan in the Night-Season; and there were also Speakings o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God to Man in Dreams.</Q> But because these People were more in Want of a clear Discerning, than of good Will, they at length came out of those Imaginations, and at last became Fellow-Believers with him; who' tho' he had great Openings in his Understand∣ing, yet great Trouble and Temptation many Times came upon him; so that when it was Day, he wish'd for Night, and when it was Night he wish'd for Day. Nevertheless, among all those Troubles, his Under∣standing was so opened, that he could say with <HI>David, Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night sheweth Knowledge;</HI> for even in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Troubles he had great Openings of many Places in Scripture.</P>
<P>As to State-Affairs, Things continu d in a distracted Condition; for the King, who after his Army had been beaten, was gone to the <HI>Scots,</HI> was by them delivered up to the <HI>English;</HI> to whom now he could no more prescribe Laws, but was fain to receive them. And the Church∣men were also at Variance; for the <HI>Independents</HI> (several of which sat also in Parliament) began to say, that between Episcopacy, (aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nst which they had fought conjunctly) and Presbytery, the Difference was only in the Name, and some few outward Circumstances, since People of a ten∣der Conscience might apprehend no less Oppression from the <HI>Presbyteri∣ans,</HI> than from the <HI>Episcopalians:</HI> And that this Fear was not vain or idle, Time afterwards hath shewn abundantly.</P>
<P>But let us return to <HI>George Fox,</HI> who in the Beginning of the Year 1647,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1647 Darbyshire.</NOTE> feeling some Drawings to go into <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> went thither, and meeting there with some Friendly People, had many Discourses with them. Then passing farther into the Peak-Country, he met with more such People, and also with some that were sway'd by empty and high Notions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham∣shire.</NOTE> And travelling into <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI> there he met with a ten∣der People, and among these one <HI>Elizabeth Hooton,</HI> of which Woman more will be said in the Sequel: With these he had some Meetings and Discourses. But his Troubles and Temptations still continu'd, and he fasted much, and walked often abroad in solitary Places, taking his
<PB N="12" REF="003104_0023_0FEFF3423B8FAA58"/>
Bible with him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1647</NOTE> and then sat in hollow Trees, and lonesome Places till Night came on; and frequently in the Night he walked mourn∣fully about, being surrounded with many Sorrows in the Times of these first Workings of the Lord in him.</P>
<P>During all this Time he never joined in Profession of Religion with any, but gave up himself to the disposing of the Lord, having so taken not only all evil Company, but also taken Leave of Father and Mother, and all other Relations; and so he travelled up and down as a Stranger on the Earth, which Way he felt his Heart inclin'd: And when he came into a Town, he took a Chamber to himself there, and carried sometimes a Month, sometimes more, sometimes less in a Place; for he was afraid of staying long in any Place, lest, being a tender young Man, he should be hurt by too familiar a Conversation with M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P>Now tho' it might seem not very agreeable with the Gravity of my Work, to mention what kind of Clothes he wore in these first Years of his Peregrination; yet I don t count it absurd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay here, that it is in∣deed true what a certain Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ger. Croes. <HI>Leather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></NOTE> <HI>viz. Gerrard Croes</HI> relates of him, that he was clothed with Leather; but not, as the said Author adds, because he could not, nor would not, forget his former Leather-Work; but it was partly for the Simplicity of that Dress, and also because such a Clothing was strong, and needed but little mending or repairing, which was commodious for him who had no steady Dwelling-Place, and every where in his travelling about fought to live in a lonely State: For keeping himself thus as a Stranger, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought heavenly Wisdom, and endeavour'd to get Knowledge of the Lord, and to be weaned from out∣ward Things to rely wholly on the Lord alone. Now tho' his Troubles were great, yet they were not so continual, but that he had some Inter∣missions, and was sometimes brought into such an heavenly Joy, that admiring the Love of God to his Soul, he would say with the <HI>Psalmist, Thou, Lord, makest a fruitful Field a barren Wilderness, and a barren Wilderness a fruitful Field.</HI> Now he regarded the Priests but little, because he clearly saw that to be trained up in the Universities, and to be instructed in Languages, liberal Arts, and the like Sciences, was not sufficient to make any one a Minister of the Gospel: But he look'd more after the Dissenting People: Yet as he had forsaken the Priests, so he left the sepa∣rate Preachers also, because he saw there was none among them all that could speak to his Condition. And when all his Hopes in them, and in all Men were gone, then he heard, according to what he relates himself, a Voice which said, <HI>There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy Condi∣tion.</HI> He having heard this, his Heart leapt for Joy; and it was shewed him why there was none upon the Earth that could speak to his Condi∣tion, namely, that he might give the Lord alone all the Glory, and that Jesus Christ might have the Pre-eminence. He then experimentally knowing that Christ enlightens Man, and gives him Grace, Faith, and Power, his Desires after the Lord, and his Zeal in the pure Knowledge of God grew stronger, so that he wished to encrease therein without the Help of any Man, Book, or Writing. Yet he was a diligent Reader of the Holy Scriptures, that speak at large of God and Christ, tho' he knew him not but by Revelation, as he, who had the Key, did open. Thus he enter'd into no Fellowship with any Society of People, because he saw no∣thing but Corruptions every where, which made him endeavour to keep Fellowship only with Christ; since in the greatest Temptations, when he almost despaired, it was shewed him, that Christ had been tempted by the same Devil; but that he had overcome him, and bruised his Head, and that therefore thro' the Power, Light, Grace, and Spirit of God, he himself might also overcome. Thus the Lord assisted him in the
<PB N="13" REF="003104_0024_0FEFF2FD27C90348"/>
deepest Miseries and Sorrows, and he found his Grace to be sufficient: Insomuch that, tho' he had yet some Desires after the Help of Men, his Thirst was chiefly after the Lord, the Creator of all, and his Son Jesus Chist; because nothing could give him any Comfort but the Lord by his Power; and he clearly saw that all the World, tho' he had possessed a King's State, would not have profited him. In this Condition his Understanding came more and more to be opened, so that he saw how Death in <HI>Adam</HI> had passed upon all Men; but that by Christ, who tasted Death for all Men, a Deliverance from it and an Entrance into God's Kingdom might be obtain'd. Nevertheless his Temptations continu'd, so that he began to question whether he might have sinned against the Ho∣ly Ghost. This brought great Perplexity and Trouble over him for ma∣ny Days; yet he still gave up himself to the Lord: And one Day, when he had been walking solitarily abroad, and was come home, he became exceeding sensible of the Love of God to him, so that he could not but admire it. In this Condition it was shew'd him, that all was to be done in and by Christ; that he conquers and destroys the Tempter, the Devil, and all his Works; and that all these Troubles and Temptations were good for him for the Trial of his Faith. The Effect of this was, that tho' at Times his Mind was much exercised, yet he was stayed by a secret Belief, and his Soul (by a firm Hope) which was to him as an Anchor, was kept unhurt in the disolute World, swimming above the raging Waves of Temptations. After this (as he relates himself) there did a pure Fire appear in him; and he saw that the Appearance ot Christ in the Heart was as a Refiner's Fire, and as the Fuller's Soap; and that a spiritual Discerning was given to him, by which he saw what it was that vail'd his Mind, and what it was that did open it: And that which could not abide in Patience, he found to be of the Flesh, that could not give up to the Will of God, nor yield up it self to die by the Cross, <HI>to wit,</HI> the Power of God. On the other hand, he perceived it was the Groans of the Spirit which did open his Understanding, and that in that Spirit there must be a waiting upon God to obtain Redemption.</P>
<P>About this Time he heard of a Woman in <HI>Lancashire</HI> that had fasted twenty two Days; and he went to see her; but coming there he saw that she was under a Temptation: And after he had spoken to her what he felt on his Mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duckenfield<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Manchester.</NOTE> he left her, and went to <HI>Duckenfield</HI> and <HI>Manchester,</HI> where he stay'd a while among the Professors he found there, and declared to them that Doctrine which now he firmly believed to be Truth; and some were convinced, so as to receive the inward divine Teaching of the Lord, and take that for their Rule. This, by what I can find, was the first Beginning of <HI>George Fox</HI>'s Preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F</HI>'s first Preaching.</NOTE> which, as I have been credibly informed, in those early Years chiefly consisted of some few, but power∣ful and piercing Words, to those whole Hearts were already in some mea∣sure prepared to be capable of receiving this Doctrine. And it seems to me that these People, and also <HI>Elizabeth Hooton,</HI> (already mention'd) have been the first who by such a mean or weak Preaching came to be his Fel∣low-Believers: Tho' there have been also some others who by the like immediate Way, as <HI>George Fox</HI> himself, have been convinced in their Minds, and came to see that they ought diligently to take Heed to the Teachings of the Grace of God that hath appeared to them. And thus it happened that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se unexpectedly and unawares came to meet with Fellow-Believers, which they were not acquainted with before, as will be more circumstantially related hereafter.</P>
<P>But to return again to <HI>George Fox:</HI> It set the Professors of those Times in a Rage, that some of their Adhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents hearkened to his Preaching; for they could not endure to hear Perfection spoke of, and of a holy and sin∣less
<PB N="14" REF="003104_0025_0FEFF34536E25E88"/>
Life, as a State that could be obtained here. Not long after he travelled to <HI>Broughton</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> and went there into a Meeting of the <HI>Baptists,</HI> where some People of other Notions also came. This gave him Occasion to preach the Doctrine of Truth among them, and that not in vain; for since he had great Openings in the Scriptures, and that a special Power of the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Workings began to spring in those Parts, several were so reach'd in their Minds, that they came to be con∣vinced, and were turned from Darkness to Light, partly by his Preach∣ing, and partly by reasoning with some. Yet he himself was still some∣times under great Temptations, without finding any to open his Condi∣tion to, but the Lord alone, unto whom he cried Night and Day for Help. Some time after he went back into <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI> and there it pleased the Lord to shew him, that the Natures of those Things which were hurtful without, were also within in the Minds of wicked Men; and that the Natures of Dogs, Swine, Vipers, and those of <HI>Cain Ishmael, I sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Pharaoh,</HI> &amp;c. were in the Hearts of many People. But since this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d grieve him, he cry'd to the Lord, saying, <HI>Why should I be thus, seeing I was never addicted to commit those Evils!</HI> And inwardly it was answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him, <HI>That it was needful he should have a Sense of all Conditions; how else should he speak to all Conditions?</HI> He also saw there was an Ocean of Dark∣ness and Death; but withal an infinite Ocean of Light and Love, which flowed over the Ocean of Darkness; in all which he perceived the infi∣nite Love of God. About that Time it happened that he walking in the Town of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> by the Steeple-house Side, it was inwardly told him, <HI>That which People trample upon must be thy Food;</HI> and at the saying of this, it was opened to him, that it was the Life of Christ People did trample upon; and that they fed one another with Words, without mind∣ing that thereby the Blood of the Son of God was trampled under Foot. And tho' it seemed at first strange to him, that he should feed on that which the high Professors trampled upon, yet it was clearly open∣ed to him how this could be.</P>
<P>Then many People came far and near to see him; and tho' he spoke sometimes, to open religious Matters to them, yet he was fearful of being drawn out by them. Now the Reason of People thus ftocking to him might proceed partly from this: There was one <HI>Brown,</HI> who up∣on his Death-Bed spoke by way of Prophecy many notable Things con∣cerning <HI>George Fox,</HI> and among the rest, <HI>that he should be made instrumen∣tal by the Lord to the Conversion of People.</HI> And of others that then were something in Shew, he said, <HI>That they should come to nothing.</HI> Which was fulfilled in Time, tho' this Man did not live to see it, for he was not raised from his Sickness But after he was buried, <HI>George Fox</HI> fell in∣to such a Condition, that he not only look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> like a dead Body, but unto many that came to see him he seemed as if he had been dead really: And many visited him for about fourteen Days Time, who wondered to see him so much alter'd in Countenance. But at length his Sorrows and Troubles began to wear off, and Tears of Joy dropped from him, so that he could have wept Night and Day with Tears of Joy in Bro∣kenness of Heart. And to give an Account of his Condition to those that are able to comprehend it, I'll give his own Words. <HI>I saw</HI> saith he, <HI>into that which was without End, and Things which cannot be uttered, and of the Greatness and Infiniteness of the Love of God, which cannot be express'd by Words: For I had been brought thro' the very Ocean of Darkness and Death, and thro' and over the Power of Satan, by the eternal glorius Power of Christ: Even thro' that Darkness, was I brought which covered all the World, and which chained down all, and shut up all in the Death. And the same eternal Power of God, which brought me thro' those Things, was that which afterwards
<PB N="15" REF="003104_0026_0FEFF301D338AB68"/>
shook the Nation, Priests, Professors, and People. Then could I say, I had been in Spiritual</HI> Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, <HI>and the Grave; but by the eter∣nal Power of God I was come out of it, and was brought over it, and the Power of it, into the Power of Christ. And I saw the Harvest white, and the Seed of God lying thick in the Ground, as ever did Wheat, that was sown outwardly, and none to gather it: And for this I mourned with Tears.</HI> Thus far <HI>George Fox</HI>'s own Words, of whom now a Report went abroad, <HI>That he was a young Man that had a Discerning Spirit:</HI> Whereupon many Professors, Priests, and People came to him, and his Ministry encreased; for he having received great Openings, spoke to them of the Things of God, and was heard with Attention by many, who going away, spread the Fame thereof. Then came the Tempter, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et upon him again, charging him that he had sinned against the Holy Ghost; but he could not tell in what; and then <HI>Paul</HI>'s Condition came before him, how after he had been taken up into the third Heavens, and seen Things not law∣ful to be uttered, a Messenger of Satan was sent to buffet him, that he might not exalt himself. Thus <HI>George Fox,</HI> by the Assistance of the Lord, got also over that Temptation. Now the 47th Year of that Cen∣tury drew to an End; and State-Affairs in <HI>England</HI> grew more and more clouded and intricate; for the King not thinking himself any longer safe at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> whither he had been brought from the Army, he withdrew to the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> whilst the Parliament still insisted on the Abrogation of Episcopacy, and would be Master of the Military For∣ces: Which the King not being willing to yield to, was now kept in closer Custody, and no more regarded as a Sovereign, to whom Obedi∣ence was due from the Parliament.</P>
<P>Under these intestine Troubles the Minds of many People came to be fitted to receive a nearer Way and Doctrine of Godliness; and it was in the Year 1648,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648</NOTE> that several Persons seeking the Lord were become Fellow-Believers, and entred into Society with <HI>George Fox;</HI> insomuch that they began to have great Meetings in <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham∣shire.</NOTE> which were visited by many. About that Time there was a Meeting of Priests and Professors at a Justice's House, and <HI>George Fox</HI> went among them, and heard them discourse concerning what the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>He had not known Sin but by the Law, which said, Thou shalt not lust.</HI> And since they held that to be spoken of the outward Law, <HI>George Fox</HI> told them, <Q><HI>Paul</HI> spoke that after he was convinc'd; for he had the outward Law before, and was bred up in it, when he was in the Lust of Per∣secution; but it was the Law of God in his Mind, which he served, and which the Law in his Members warred against.</Q> This Saying found so much Entrance, that those of the Priests and Professors that were most moderate, yielded, and consented, that it was not the out∣ward Law, but the Inward, that shewed the inward Lust, which the Apostle spake of. After this he went again to <HI>Mansfield,</HI> where was a great Meeting of Professors and other People; and being among them, and moved to pray, such an extraordinary Power appeared, and seized on the Hearts of some in so eminent a Manner, that even the House seem'd to be shaken: And after Prayer, some of the Auditory began to say, that This resembled that in the Days of the Apostles, when on the Day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> the House where they were met was shaken.</P>
<P>Not long after this, there was another great Meeting of Professors, where <HI>G. Fox</HI> came also; who hearing them discourse about the Blood of Christ, he cry'd out among them: <HI>Do ye not see the Blood of Christ? Ye must see it in your Hearts, to sprinkle your Hearts and Consciences from dead Works, to serve the living God.</HI> This was a Doctrine which startled these Professors, who would have the Blood of Christ only without them, not
<PB N="16" REF="003104_0027_0FEFF346DAE36858"/>
thinking that it was to be felt inwardly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648</NOTE> But a certain Captain, whose Name was <HI>Amos Stoddard,</HI> was so reached, that seeing how they endea∣vour'd to bear <HI>G. Fox</HI> down with many Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. Stoddard.</NOTE> he said, <HI>Let the Youth speak, hear the Youth speak;</HI> and coming afterwards to be more acquaint∣ed with <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he had Opportunity to be farther instructed in the Way of Godliness of which he came to be a faithful Follower. Some Time after <HI>G. Fox</HI> return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to <HI>Leicestershire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leicester-sh.</NOTE> his own Country, where several tender People came to be convinced by his Preaching. And passing thence into <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> he met with a great Company of Professors, who being come together in the Field, were praying and expounding the Scriptures. Here the Bible was given him, which he opened on the 5th of <HI>Matthew,</HI> where Christ expounded some Parts of the Law; from whence <HI>G. Fox</HI> took Occasion to open to them the inward and out∣ward State of Man. And that which he held forth getting some Ground, they fell into a fierce Contention among themselves, and so parted.</P>
<P>Then he heard of a great Meeting to be at <HI>Leicester</HI> for a Dispute, wherein those of several Persuations, as <HI>Presbyterians, Independents, Bap∣tists</HI> and <HI>Episcopalians</HI> were said to be all concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. This Meeting being appointed to be in the Steeple-house, he went thither, where Abun∣dance of People were met, some of those that spoke being in Pews, and the Priest in the Pulpit. At last after several Reasonings, a Woman started a Question, and asked, <HI>What that Birth was the Apostle</HI> Peter <HI>spoke of;</HI> viz. <HI>a being born again of incorruptible Seed, by the Word of God, that li∣veth and abideth for ever?</HI> The Priest, instead of answering this Questi∣on, said to her, <HI>I permit not a Woman to speak in the Church,</HI> tho' he had before given Liberty for any to speak. This kindled <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Zeal, so that he stept up and ask'd the Priest, <HI>Dost thou call this Place</HI> (the Steeple-house) <HI>a Church? Or dost thou call this mixt Multitude a Church?</HI> But the Priest not answering to this, asked <HI>What a Church was?</HI> And <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>The Church was the Pillar and Ground of Truth, made up of Li∣ving Stones, Living Members, a Spiritual Houshold, which Christ was the Head of: But he was not the Head of a mixt Multitude, or of an old House, made up of Lime, Stones, and Wood.</HI> This caused such a Stir, that the Priest came down out of his Pulpit, and others out of their Pews, where∣by the Dispute was marr'd. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to a great Inn, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e disputed with the Priests and Professors of all Sorts, maintaining what he had said, till they all went away; yet several were convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that Day, and among these the Woman who asked the Question aforesaid.</P>
<P>After this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham∣shire.</NOTE> <HI>G. Fox</HI> return'd again into <HI>Nottingamshire,</HI> and went into the Vale of <HI>Beavor,</HI> where he preach'd Repentance to the People: And he staying some Weeks there, and passing thro' several Towns, many were convinced of the Truth of his Doctrine. About that Time, as he was sitting by the Fire one Morning, a Cloud came over him, and a Temp∣tation beset him; and he sitting still, it was suggested, <HI>All Things come by Nature;</HI> and he was in a Manner quite clouded; but he continuing to sit still, the People of the House perceived nothing: At length a living Hope arose in him, and also a Voice, that said, <HI>There is a living God, who made all Things;</HI> and immediately the Cloud and Temptation vanished away, whereby his Heart was made glad, and he praised the Lord.</P>
<P>Not long after, he met with some People that had a mischievous No∣tion, <HI>That there was no God, but that all Things came by Nature.</HI> But he reasoning with them, so confounded them, that some were fain to confess that there was a living God. Then he saw that it was good for him to have been tried under such a Cloud. Now in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Parts he had great Meetings; and a divine Power working in that Country and thereabouts,
<PB N="17" REF="003104_0028_0FEFF3040E306A70"/>
many were gathered. Then coming into <HI>Darlyshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Darlyshire. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.ton. Mansfield.</NOTE> there was a great Meeting of his Friends at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> where many of them began to preach the Doctrine of Truth, who afterwards were moved to declare the Truth in other Places also. <HI>G. Fox</HI> coming about this Time to <HI>Mansfield,</HI> heard that in a Town about eight Miles off, there was to be a Sitting of Justi∣ces, to deliberate about hiring of Servants; and he, feeling a Constraint upon his Mind, went thither, and exhorted them, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to oppress the Ser∣vants in their Wages, but to do that which was right and just to them:</HI> And the Ser∣vants, many of which were come there, he admonished <HI>To do their Duty, and serve honestly:</HI> And they all received his Exhortation kindly. He felt himself also moved to go to several Courts and Steeple-houses at <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and other Places, warning them to leave on Oppression, Deceit and other Evils. And having heard at <HI>Mansfield</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one in the Country, who was a common Drankard and a noted Whore-master, and a Poet also, he went to him, and reproved him in an awful Manner for his evil Courses; which so struck him, that coming afterwards to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he told him, <HI>That he was so smitten when he spoke to him, that he had scarce any Strength left in him.</HI> And this Man was so thoroughly convinced, that he turned from his Wickedness, and became an honest sober Man, to the Astonishment of those that knew him before. Thus the Work of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Ministry went forward, and many were thereby turn'd from Darkness to Light; and divers Meetings of his Friends, who were much increased in Number since the Year 1646, were now set up in seve∣ral Places. Now <HI>G. Fox</HI> was come up to quite another State than for∣merly he had lived in; for he knew now not only a Renewing of the Heart, and a Restoration of the Mind, but the Virtues of the Crea∣tures were also open'd to him; so that he began to deliberate whether he should practise Physick for the Good of Mankind. But God had another Service for him; and it was shewed him that he was to enter into a Spiritual Labour; and also that those who continu'd faithful to the Lord, might attain to a State in which the sinful Inclination was sub∣du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Moreover the three great Professions in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> Phy∣sick, Divinity, (so called) and Law, were opened to him, whereby he saw that the Physicians wanting the Wisdom of God, by whicn the Creatures were made, knew not their Virtues: That the Lawyers gene∣ral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y were void of Equity and Justice, and so out of the Law of God, which went over the first Transgression, and over all Sin, and answered the Spirit of God that was oppressed in Man: And that the Priests, for the most Part, were out of the true Faith, which Christ is the Author of, and which purifies the Heart, and brings Man to have Access to God. So that these Physicians, Lawyers, and Priests, who pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended to cure the Body, to establish the Property of the People, and to cure the Soul, were all without the true Knowledge and Wisdom they ought to possess. Yet he felt there was a Divine Power, by which all might be reformed, if they would receive, and bow unto it. And he saw also, that tho' the Priests did err, yet they were not the greatest Deceivers spoken of in the Scriptures; but that these great Deceivers were such, who, as <HI>Cain,</HI> had heard the Voice of God, and who, as <HI>Corah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> and their Company, were come out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thro' the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and had praised God on the Banks of the Sea-shore; and who being come as far as <HI>Balaam,</HI> could speak the Word of the Lord, as having heard his Voice, and known his Spirit, so that they could see the Star of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the Goodliness of <HI>Israel</HI>'s Tents, which no Enchantment could pre∣vail against: These that could speak so much of their Divine Experi∣ence, and yet turn'd from the Spirit of God, and went into the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣saying, these he saw would be great Deceivers, far beyond the Priests.
<PB N="18" REF="003104_0029_0FEFF3491E026F20"/>
He saw also that People generally did read the Scriptures, without ha∣ving a true Sense of them; for some cry'd out much against <HI>Cain, Ish∣mael, Esau, Corah, Balaam, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> &amp;c. not regarding that the Nature of these was yet alive in themselves; whereby they always apply'd to o∣thers that Nature in which they themselves lived.</P>
<P>The Lord had also opened to him now, that <HI>Every Man was enlighten∣ed by the Divine Light of Christ;</HI> and he saw that they that believed in it, came out of Condemnation, and became the Children of the Light: But they that hated it, and did not believe in it, were condemn'd by it, tho' they made a Profession of Christ. All this he saw in the pure Openings of the Light. He also saw that God had afforded a Measure of his Spirit to all Men, and that thereby they could truly come to serve the Lord, and to worship him; and that his Grace, which brings Salvation, and had appeared to all Men, was able to bring them into the Favour of God.</P>
<P>And on a certain Time, as he was walking in the Fields, he under∣stood that it was said to him <HI>Thy Name is witten in the Lamb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Book of Life, which was before the Foundation of the World.</HI> This he took to be the Voice of the Lord, and believed it to be true. Then he felt himself powerfully moved to go abroad into the World, which was like a briery thorny Wilderness; and he found then that the World swelled against him, and made a Noise like the great raging Waves of the Sea. For when he came to proclaim the Day of the Lord amongst the Priests, Professors, Magistrates, and People, they were all like a disturbed Sea. Now he was sent to turn People from Darkness to the Light, that they might receive Christ Jesus; for he saw, that to as many as should re∣ceive him in his Light, he would give Power to become the Sons of God: And that therefore he was to turn People to the Grace of God, and to the Truth in the Heart; and that by this Grace they might be taught, and thereby obtain Salvation; since Christ had died for all Men, and was a Propitiation for all, having enlightned all Men with his Divine and Saving Light, and the Manifestation of the Spirit of God being given to every Man to profit withal. He now being sent thus to preach the Everlasting Gospel, did it with Gladness and endeavour'd to bring People off from their own Ways, to Christ, the new and living Way, and from their Churches, which Men had made and gathered, to the Church in God, the general Assembly written in Heaven, which Christ is the Head of; and from the World's Teachers, made by Men, to learn of Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and of whom the Father said <HI>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him;</HI> and off from the World's Wor∣ship, to the Spirit of God in the inward Parts, that in it they might worship the Father, who seeks such to worship him.</P>
<P>Now he found also that the Lord forbad him to put off his Hat to arry Men, high or low; and he was required to <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee</HI> every Man and Woman, without Distinction, and not to bid People <HI>Good Morrow</HI> or <HI>Good Evening;</HI> neither right he bow, or scrape with his Leg to any one. This was such an unusual Thing with People, that it made many of all Persuations and Professions rage against him; but by the Assistance of the Lord he was carry'd over all, and many came to be his Fellow-Believers, and turn'd God, in a little Time; altho' it is almost unspeakable what Rage and Fury arose, what Blows, Pinchings, Beatings, and Imprison∣ments they underwent, besides the Danger they were sometimes in of losing their Lives for these Matters: So indiscreet is Man in his natural State. For here it did not avail to say, <Q>That the Hat-Honour was an Honour from below, which the Lord would lay in the Dust, and stain it; that it was an Honour which the Proud look'd for, without seek∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="003104_0030_0FEFF305C9F03468"/>
the Honour which came from God alone; that it was an Ho∣nour invented by Men in the Fall, who therefore were offended if it were not given them; tho' they would be look'd upon as Church-Members, and good Christians; whereas Christ himself said, <HI>How can ye believe, who receive Honour of one another, and seek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</HI> That it was an Honour, which in Rela∣tion to the outward Ceremony, <HI>viz.</HI> the Putting off the Hat, was the same which was given to God; so that in the outward Sign of Reverence, no Distinction or Difference was made betwixt the Crea∣tor and the Creature: Nay, that the Saying of <HI>You</HI> to a single Per∣son went yet a Degree further; for not only Kings and Princes for∣merly among the <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> had not been offended at it when they were <HI>Thee'd</HI> and <HI>Thou'd,</HI> but Experience shew'd that this still was the Language wherewith God was daily spoken to, both in Religious Assemblies, and without,</Q> But all these Reasons found little Entrance with Priests, Magistrates, and others: Bitter Revi∣lings, ill Usage, and shameful Abuses, were now become the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are of those who, for Conscience-sake, could no longer follow the ordinary Custom: For tho' it was pretended that the Putting off of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at was but a small Thing, which none ought to scruple; yet it was a wonderful Thing to see what great Disturbance this pretended small Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter caused among People of all Sorts; so that even such that would be look'd upon as those that practised Humility and Meekness, soon shew'd what Spirit they were of, when this worldly Honour was de∣ny'd them. But all this serv'd to strengthen the Fellow-Believers more and more in their plain Carriage, and made them live up faithfully to the Convincement of their Conscience, without Respect of Persons.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Troubles of the Land continu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. We have left the King in the foregoing Year in the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> in Effect unking'd. Some time after the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> being then past fourteen Years of Age, and second Son to the King, was fled to <HI>Holland,</HI> disguised in Woman's Apparel; and his eldest Brother the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who two Years be∣fore was fled to <HI>France,</HI> came now to <HI>Helvoot-Sluce</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> and went from thence with some <HI>English</HI> Men of War, whose Commanders were for the King, to the <HI>Downs</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> with Intention to take the Ships coming from <HI>London.</HI> He also published, by the spreading of a Decla∣ration, that he came to release his Father. Now there was also a Nego∣ciation on Foot between the King and the Parliament, and there seem'd some Hopes of an Accommodation, had not the Army, the chiefest In∣strument of breaking down the Royal Power, opposed it, by calling for Justice against all those who had wrong'd the Country, none excepted. This broke off the Treaty, several suspected Members were turn'd out of the Parliament, and the King was carried to <HI>Windsor</HI> about the Time of <HI>Christmas;</HI> and it was resolv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d henceforth to send no more Deputations to him, or receive any from him; who now was no more named <HI>King;</HI> but only <HI>Charles Stuart:</HI> A very strange Turn of mundane Affairs, and a mighty Evidence of the fluctuating Inconstancy thereof. But Things made no Stand here, for it was concluded to bring him to a Trial; and the Parliament appointed General <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> and <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> Lieutenant General, with more than an Hundred other Persons, to be his Judges. These being formed into a Court of Justice, the King was con∣ducted from <HI>Windsor</HI> to St. <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and from thence brought before them in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> where he was arraigned as guilty of High-Treason, for having levied War against the Parliament and People of <HI>England.</HI> But he not owning that Court to be lawful, nor acknowledging their Au∣thority, said, <HI>I am not intrusted by the People, they are mine by Inheritance.</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="003104_0031_0FEFF34C458FE3A0"/>
And being unwilling to answer to the Charge, he was on the 27th of the Month call'd <HI>January</HI> sentenced to Death, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murder∣er, and a publick Enemy to the Common-wealth. But before this Sen∣tence was pronounced, the King desired that he might be permitted to make a Propostion to both Houses of Parliament in the painted Cham∣ber, designing, as was since said, to propose <HI>his own Resignation, and the Ad∣mission of his Son, the Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>to the Throne.</HI> But this Request was denied by the Court. Now tho' the said Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> considering his Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Danger, had apply'd himself to the States General of the United Provinces at the <HI>Hague</HI> for Assistance; and that these sent two Ambassadors to the Parliament, who coming to <HI>London</HI> on the same Day the fatal Sentence was pronounced, could not obtain Admission till next Day, to the Speakers of both Houses, and were afterwards with <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and other Commanders; and one of them had also his Audience in the Parliament to interceed with them for the King's Life; yet all proved in vain: For on the 30th of the foresaid Month, the King was brought on a Scaffold erected before the Banqueting-House, and his Head severed from his Body. The same Day the Parliament ordered a Declaration to be published, whereby it was declared Trea∣son to endeavour to promote the Prince of <HI>Wales, Charles Stuart,</HI> to be King of <HI>England,</HI> or any other single Person to be the chief Governour thereof. And then after having abolished the House of Pee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, they assumed to themselves the chief Government of the Nation, with the Title of, <HI>The Parliament of the Commonwealth of</HI> England.</P>
<P>No sooner the News of the King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Death was come into <HI>Scotland,</HI> but <HI>Charles,</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> was proclaimed at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> provided he should, before assuming the Royal Authority, give Satisfaction about some Matters concerning Religion. And tho this displeased the <HI>English,</HI> yet the <HI>Scots</HI> asserted that they might as well do so, as the <HI>English,</HI> who had done the same at the Death of the late King's Father, in the Year 1625.</P>
<P>Leaving now State-Affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1649</NOTE> Let's return to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who in the Year 1649 was much exercised to declare openly agninst all Sorts of Sins; and therefore he went not only to the Courts, crying for Justice, and ex∣horting the Judges and Justices to do Jusitce, but he warned also those that kept Publick-Houses for Entertainment, not to let People have more Drink, than what would do them good. He also testified against Wakes, May-games, Plays, and Shews, by which People were led into Vanity, and drawn off from the Fear of God; the Days that were set forth for Holy-days, being usually the Times wherein God was most dishonoured. When he came in Markets, he also declared against de∣ceitful Merchandizing, and warned all to deal justly, and to speak the Truth; and he testified against the Mountebanks playing Tricks on their Stages: And when Occasion offer'd, he warned the School-masters and School-mistresses to teach their Children to mind the Fear of the Lord; saying, that they themselves ought to be Examples and Patterns of Vertue to them. But very burdensome it was to him, when he heard the Bell ring to call People together to the Steeple-house; for it seemed to him just like a Market-Bell, to gather the People, that the Priest might set forth his Ware to Sale. Going once on a First-Day of the Week,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham.</NOTE> in the Morning, with some of his Friends to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> to have a Meeting there; and having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Top of a Hill the great Steeple-house of the Town, he felt it required of him to cry against that Idol-Temple and the Worshippers therein: Yet he said nothing of this to those that were with him, but went on with them to the Meeting, where after some Stay, he left them, and went away to
<PB N="21" REF="003104_0032_0FEFF3084F4C4280"/>
the Steeple-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1649</NOTE> where the Priest took for his Text these Words of the Apostle <HI>Peter: We have also a more sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take Heed, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in your Hearts.</HI> And he told the Peo∣ple that this was the Scripture, by which they were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y all Doc∣trines, Religions, and Opinions. <HI>G. Fox</HI> hearing this, felt such mighty Power and Godly Zeal working in him, that he was made to cry out, <HI>O no, it is not the Scripture, but it is the Holy Spirit, by which the Holy Men of God gave forth the Scriptures, whereby Opinions, Religions, and Judgments are to be try'd. That was it which led into all Truth, and gave the Know∣ledge thereof. For the Jews had the Scriptures, and yet resisted the Holy Ghost, and rejected Christ, the bright Morning-Star, and persecuted him and his Apostles; tho' they took upon them to try their Doctrine by the Scriptures; but they erred in Judgment, and did not try them aright, because they did it without the Holy Ghost.</HI> He thus speaking, the Officers came and took him away, and put him into a nasty stinking Prison. At Night he was brought before the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs of the Town; and they examining him, he told them, That the Lord had moved him to come there into the Steeple-house: And tho' the Mayor at first appeared peevish and fretful, yet he was allayed: However, after some Discourse <HI>G. Fox</HI> was sent back to Prison, But sometime after, the Head-Sheriff <HI>John Reckless</HI> sent for him to his House: And when <HI>G. Fox</HI> came in, the Sheriff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Wife met him in the Hall, and taking him by the Hand, said, <HI>Salvation is come to our House:</HI> For his Speech in the Stee∣ple-house had so amazed many, that they could not get the Sound of it out of their Ears; and not only this Woman was wrought upon, but also her Husband, Children, and Servants were much changed by the Power of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> thus coming to lodge at this Sheriff's House, had great Meet∣ings there, and some Persons of Quality in the World, came to them; and they were reach'd very eminently in their Minds by an invisible Power.<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Reckless</NOTE> <HI>Reckless</HI> being of this Number, sent for the other Sheriff, and for a Woman they traded with; and he told her in the Presence of the other Sheriff, that they had wronged her in their Dealings with her, and that therefore they ought to make her Restitution; to which <HI>Reckless</HI> exhorted the other Sheriff, being himself made sensible that this was an indispensable Duty: For a mighty Change was now wrought in him, and his Understanding came to be opened; so that on the next Market-Day, as he was walking with <HI>G. Fox</HI> in the Chamber, in his Slippers, he said, <HI>I must go into the Market, and preach Repentance to the People:</HI> And accordingly he went in his Slippers into the Market, and into several Streets, preaching Repentance. Some others also in the Town were moved to speak to the Mayor and Magistrates, and to the People, ex∣horting them to repent. But this the Magistrates could not endure; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Passion on <HI>G. Fox,</HI> they sent for him from the Sheriff's Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and committed him to the common Prison, where he was kept till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sizes came on, and then he was to have been brought before the Judge, but that the Sheriff's Man being somewhat long in fetching him, the Judge; was risen before <HI>G. Fox</HI> came to the Session-House; how∣ever, the Judge was a little displeased, having said, <HI>He would have admonished the Youth</HI> (meaning <HI>G. Fox) if he had been brought before him.</HI> So he was carried back again to Prison. In the mean while such a wonderful Power broke forth among his Friends, that many were asto∣nished at it, so that even several of the Priests were made tender, and some did confess to the Power of the Lord. Now tho' the People began to be very rude, yet the Governour of the Castle was so moderate, that
<PB N="22" REF="003104_0033_0FEFF34FAEE683F8"/>
he sent down Soldiers to disperse them. <HI>G. Fox</HI> having been kept Pri∣soner a pretty long Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1649 Mansfield-Woodhouse.</NOTE> was at length set at Liberty, and then tra∣velled as before, in the Work of the Lord. Coming to <HI>Mansfield Wood∣house,</HI> he found there a distracted Woman under a Doctor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Hand, being bound, and with her Hair loose; and the Doctor being about to let her Blood, could get no Blood from her; which made <HI>G. Fox</HI> desire to un∣bind her; and after this was done, he spoke to her, and bad her in the Name of the Lord, <HI>to be quiet and still.</HI> This proved of such Effect, that she became still; and her Mind coming to be settled, she mended, and afterwards received the Doctrine of Truth, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nued in it to her Death. Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was in this Place, he was moved to go to the Steeple-house, and declare there the Truth to the Priest and the People; which doing, the People fell upon him, and struck him down, almost smothering him, for he was cruelly beaten and bruised with their Hands, Bibles, and Sticks. Then they hal'd him out, who was hardly able to stand, and put him into the Stocks, where he sat some Hours: And they having brought Horse-Whips, threaten'd to whip him. After some Time they had him before the Magistrates, at a Knight's House; who seeing how ill he had been used, set him at Liberty, after much Threatning. But the rude Multitude stoned him out of the Town; and tho' he was scarce able to go, yet with much ado he got about a Mile from the Town, where he met with some People that gave him something to comfort him, because he was inwardly bruised. But it pleased the Lord soon to heal him again; and some People were that Day convinced of the Truth, which had been declared by him in the Steeple-house, at which he rejoyced.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leicester∣shire. Barrow.</NOTE> Now he went out of <HI>Nottingham-shire</HI> into <HI>Leicester∣shire,</HI> accompanied by several of his Friends; and coming to <HI>Barrow,</HI> he discoursed with some <HI>Baptists;</HI> and one of them saying, <HI>What was not of Faith, was Sin;</HI> He asked, <HI>What Faith was, and how it was wrought in Man?</HI> But they turning off from that, spoke of their <HI>Water-Baptism:</HI> Which gave Occasion to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and his Friends, to ask, <HI>Who baptized</HI> John <HI>the Baptist, and who baptized</HI> Peter, John, <HI>and the rest of the Apostles:</HI> But they were silent at those Questions. After some other Discourse, they parted. On the next First-Day of the Week, <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and those that were with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bagworth.</NOTE> came to <HI>Bagworth,</HI> and went to a Steeple-house; and after the Priest had done, they had some Service there by speaking to the People. Then passing from thence, he heard of a People that were in Prison in <HI>Coventry</HI> for Religion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coventry</NOTE> and as he was walking towards the Goal, the Word of the Lord (as he relates) came to him, saying, <HI>My Love was always to thee, and thou art in my Love.</HI> By this he was over∣come with a Sense of the Love of God, and much strengthned in his inward Man. But coming into the Goal, a great Power of Darkness struck at him; for insteed of meeting such as were imprison'd for Reli∣gion, he found them to be Blasphemers, who were come to that Degree, that they said, <HI>They were Gods;</HI> and this their wicked Opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> en∣deavoured to maintain by Scripture, misapplying what was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> when the Sheet was let down to him, viz. <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> san∣ctified, he should not call common or unclean:</HI> And the Words of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Apo∣stle <HI>Paul,</HI> concerning <HI>God's reconciling all Things to himself, Things in Hea∣ven, and Things on Earth, G. Fox,</HI> who was greatly grieved at this Pro∣faneness, told them that these Scriptures were nothing to their Purpose. And seeing they said, <HI>They were God,</HI> he asked them, <HI>If they knew whe∣ther it would rain to-morrow?</HI> And they saying, <HI>They could not tell;</HI> he told them, <HI>God could tell.</HI> He asked them also, <HI>If they thought they should be always in that Condition, or should change?</HI> And they answering, <HI>That they could not tell; G. Fox</HI> told them. <HI>That God could tell it, and that he
<PB N="23" REF="003104_0034_0FEFF30CFB84A608"/>
did not change.</HI> This confounded them, and brought them down for that Time; so after having reproved them for their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asphem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us Expressions, he went away. Not long after this, one of these Ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, whose Name was <HI>Joseph Salmon,</HI> gave forth a Book of Recantation, upon which they were set at Liberty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atherstone.</NOTE> From <HI>Coventry, G. fox</HI> went to <HI>Atherstone,</HI> where, going into the Chappel, he declared to the Priests and the People, <Q>That God was come to teach his People himself, and to bring them off from all their Man-made Teachers, to hear his Son.</Q> Ana <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' some few raged, yet they were generally pretty quie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and some were convinced.</P>
<P>After this Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Market-Bos∣worth.</NOTE> he went to <HI>Market-Bosworth,</HI> and coming into the publick Place of Worship, he found <HI>Nathaniel Stevens</HI> preaching, who, as hath been said already, was Priest of the Town where <HI>G. Fox</HI> was born; here <HI>G. Fox</HI> taking Occasion to speak, <HI>Stevens</HI> told the People, <HI>he was mad, and that they should not hear him;</HI> tho he had said before to one Colonel <HI>Pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy</HI> concerning him, <HI>That there was never such a Plant bred in</HI> England. The People now being stirred up by this Priest, fell upon <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Friends, and stoned them out of the Town. Nevertheless this wrought on the Minds of some others, so that they were made loving.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> now travelling on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Twy-Cross.</NOTE> came to <HI>Twy-Cross,</HI> where he spoke to the Excise-men, and warned them to take heed of oppressing the Poor. There being in that Town a great Man, that had long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am sick, and was given over by the Physicians, he went to visit him in his Chamber; and af∣ter having
spoken some Words to him, he was moved to pray by his Bed-side; and the Lord was entreated so that the sick Man was restored to Health. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> being come down, and speaking to some that were in a Room there, a Servant came with a naked Rapier in his Hand, and threatned to stab him; but he looking stedfastly on this Man, said, <HI>Alack for thee, poor Creature! What wilt thou do with thy carnal Weapon? It is no more to me than a Straw.</HI> This Servant being stop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thus, went away in a Rage, and his Master hearing of it, turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him out of his Ser∣vice, and was afterwards very loving to Friends; and when <HI>G. Fox</HI> came to that Town again, both he and his Wife came to see him. After this he went into <HI>Darbyshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Darby-shire. Chesterfield. Britland.</NOTE> where his Fellow-Believers encreased in godly Strength; and coming to <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> he found one <HI>Britland</HI> to be Priest there, who having been partly convinced of the Doctrine of Truth, had spoken much in Behalf of it, and saw beyond the common Sort of Priests. But when the Priest of that Town died, he got the Parsonage. <HI>G. Fox</HI> now speaking to him and the People, endeavour'd to bring them off from Man's Teaching, unto God's Teaching: And tho' the Priest was not able to gainsay, yet they had him before the Mayor, and threatned to send him to the House of Correction: But when it was late in the Night, the Officers and the Watchmen led him out of the Town.</P>
<P>Concerning State-Affairs it hath been said already, that <HI>Charles</HI> II. had been proclaimed King by the <HI>Scots;</HI> but he being still in <HI>Holland,</HI> they sent to him there, that he would subscribe the Covenant, and so abro∣gate Episcopacy in <HI>Scotland:</HI> It was also desired that he would put some Lords from him. But those that were sent, received only an Answer from the young King in general Terms, which made them return home again, where we will leave them, to see in the mean while how it went with <HI>G. Fox.</HI></P>
<P>He having been sent away, as hath been said, from <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> came to <HI>Darby</HI> in the year 1650,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Darby 1650</NOTE> and lay at a Doctor's House, whose Wife was convinced of the Truth he preached. Now it happened, as he was walking there in his Chamber, that the Bell rung; and he hearing it, asked the Woman of the House, <HI>What the Bell rung for?</HI> And she told him, There was to be a great Lecture there that Day; so that many
<PB N="24" REF="003104_0035_0FEFF3521797E2F0"/>
of the Officers of the Army, and Priests and Preachers were to be there, as also a Colonel that was a Preacher. Then he felt himself moved to go to that Congregation; and when the Service was done, he spoke to them what he believed the Lord required of him, and they were pretty quiet. But there came an Officer, who took him by the Hand, and said, that he, and the other two that were with him, must go before the Magistrates. He then coming about the first Hour in the Afternoon, before them, they asked him, <HI>Why he came thither?</HI> To which having answer'd, <HI>That God had moved him to it;</HI> he farther said, that <HI>God did not dwell in Temples made with Hands; and that all their Preaching, Baptism, and Sacrifices would never sanctify them; but that they ought to look unto Christ in them, and not unto Men; because it is Christ that sanctifies.</HI> They then running into many Words, he told them, <HI>They were not to dispute of God and Christ, but to obey him.</HI> But this Doctrine did so displease them, that they often put him in and out of the Room, and sometimes told him scoffingly, <HI>That he was taken up in Raptures.</HI> At last they asked him, <HI>Whether he was sanctified?</HI> And he answering, <HI>Yes,</HI> they then asked, <HI>If he had no Sin?</HI> To which he said, <HI>Christ my Saviour has taken away my Sin, and in him there is no Sin.</HI> Then he and his Friends were asked, <HI>How they knew that Christ did abide in them?</HI> And <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>By his Spirit, that he has given us.</HI> Then they temptingly asked, <HI>If any of them was Christ?</HI> But he answered, <HI>Nay, we are nothing, Christ is all.</HI> At length they also asked, <HI>If a Man steals, is it no Sin?</HI> To which he answered with the Words of Scrip∣ture, <HI>All Ʋnrighteousness is Sin.</HI> So when they had wearied themselves in examining him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>One</HI> Fret∣well.</NOTE> they committed him, and another Man, to the House of Correction in <HI>Darby</HI> for six Months, as Blasphemers, as appears by the following <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttimus.</HI></P>

<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> being thus, as hath been said lock'd up, the Priests bestirr'd themselves in their Pulpits to preach up Sin for Term of Life; and they endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to persuade People that it was an erroneous Doctrine, to assert a Possibility of being freed from Sin in this Life, as was held forth by the <HI>Quakers;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or this began now to be the Name whereby <HI>G.

<PB N="25" REF="003104_0036_0FEFF30F2E067498"/>
who sign'd the aforesaid <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and an <HI>Independent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1650</NOTE> hearing that <HI>G. Fox</HI> bad him, and those about him, <HI>Tremble at the Word of the Lord!</HI> took hold of this weighty Saying with such an airy Mind, that from thence he took Occasion to call him, and his Friends, scornfully, <HI>QƲA∣KERS.</HI> This new and unusual Denomination was taken up so eagerly, and spread so among the People, that not only the Priests there from that Time gave no other Name to the Professors of the Light, but sounded it so gladly abroad, that it soon ran over all <HI>England;</HI> and ma∣king no Stand there, it quickly reach'd to the neighbouring Countries, and adjacent Kingdoms, insomuch, that the said Professors of the Light, for Distinction's-Sake from other religious Societies, have been called every where by that <HI>English</HI> Name, which sounding very odd in the Ears of some foreign Nations, hath also given Occasion to many silly Stories.</P>
<P>Now because in those early Times, among the many Adherents of this Persuasion, were also some that having been People of a rude and disso∣lute Life, came so to be prick'd to the Heart, that they grew true Peni∣tents, with real Sorrow for their former Transgressions; it happen'd that not only they at Meetings did burst out into Tears, but also were affected with such a singular Commotion of the Mind, that some Shakings of their Bodies were perceived; some People naturally being more affected with the Passions of the Mind, than others; for even Anger doth trans∣port some Men so violently, that it makes them tremble; whereas o∣thers will quake with Fear: And what Wonder then, if some being struck with the Terrors of God did tremble? But this being seen by envious Men, they took Occasion from thence to tell, that these Pro∣fessors of the Light performed their Worship with Shaking; yet they themselves never asserted that Trembling of the Body was an essential Part of their Religion, but have occasionally said the contrary; tho' they did not deny themselves to be such as trembled before God; and they also did not stick to say, that all People ought to do so; however thereby not enjoining a bodily Shaking.</P>
<P>We have seen just now, how one <HI>Fretwell</HI> was committed with <HI>G. Fox</HI> to the House of Correction; but he not standing faithful in his Testimo∣ny, obtained, by Intercession of the Jailor, Leave of the Justice to go see his Mother, and so got his Liberty; and then a Report was spread, that he had said, <HI>That</HI> G. Fox <HI>had bewitched and deceived him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> was now become the Object of many People's Hatred; Magi∣strates, Priests, and Professors were all in a Rage against him; and the Jailor, to find something wherewithal to ensnare him, would sometimes ask him such silly Questions, as, <HI>Whether the Door was latch'd, or not?</HI> thinking thereby to draw some sudden unadvised Answer from him where∣by he might charge Sin upon him: But he was kept so watchful and cir∣cumspect, that they could get no Advantage of him. Not long after his Commitment, he was moved to write both to the Priests and Magistrates of <HI>Darby.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ger. Croese</NOTE> Now since <HI>Ger. Croese</HI> in the Beginning of his History repre∣sents <HI>G. Fox</HI> as one altogether unfit, not only to write legibly, but also to express his Mind clearly in Writing, and that therefore he always was oblig'd to employ others that could set down his Meaning intelligibly, it won't be besides the Purpose to say, that this is more than any ever will be able to prove. For tho' it can't be denied, that he was no elegant Writer, nor good Speller, yet it is true, that his Characters being tolera∣ble, his Writing was legible, and the Matter he treated was intelligible, tho' his Stile was not like that of a skilful Linguist. And albeit he em∣ploy'd others, because himself was no quick Writer, yet generally they were young Lads, who as they durst not have attempted to alter his Words and Phrases, so they would not have been skilful enough to re∣fine
<PB N="26" REF="003104_0037_0FEFF353B3CE67C8"/>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>O <HI>Friends,</HI> I was sent unto you to tell you, That if you had receiv∣ed the <HI>Gospel freely,</HI> you would minister it <HI>freely</HI> without Money or Price: But you make a <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Sale,</HI> of what the Prophets and the Apostles have spoken; and so you corrupt the <HI>Truth.</HI> And you are the Men, that <HI>lead silly Woman Captive,</HI> who are ever learning, and never able to come to the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Truth:</HI> you have a <HI>Form</HI> or Godliness; but you deny the <HI>Power.</HI> Now as <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres</HI> withstood <HI>Moses,</HI> so do you resist the <HI>Truth;</HI> being Men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the <HI>Faith.</HI> But you shall proceed no fur∣ther; for your <HI>Folly</HI> shall be made manifest to all Men, as theirs was.

<P>Now whilst <HI>G.

And if your Faith be true, it will give you Victory over Sin and the Devil, and purity your Hearts and Con∣sciences, (for the true Faith held in a pure Conscience) it will bring you to please God, and give you Access to him again.</Q> But such a Language as this they could not endure; for they said, <HI>They could not be∣lieve that any could be free from Sin on this Side the Grave.</HI> To which he answered, <HI>That then they might give over their Talking concerning the Scrip∣tures, which were the Words of Holy Men; whilst they themselves pleaded for Ʋnholiness.</HI> At another Time another Company of such Professors com∣ing, and they also pleading for Sin, he asked them, <HI>Whether they had Hope?</HI> To which they answered, <HI>Yes, God forbid but we should have Hope.</HI> Then he asked, <HI>What Hope is it you have? Is Christ in you, the Hope of your Glory? Doth it purify you, as he is pure?</HI> But they could not abide to hear of being made pure here; and therefore he bad them, <Q>Forbear talking of the Scriptures, which were the Holy Mens Words; for the Holy Men that writ the Scriptures (said he) pleaded for Holiness in Heart, Life, and Conversation here, but since you plead for Impurity and Sin, which is of the Devil, what have you to do with the Holy M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns Words?</Q></P>
<P>Now the Keeper of the Prison, who was also an high Professor, was much enrag'd against <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and spoke wickedly of him. But it pleased the Lord one Day to strike him so, that he was under great Anguish of Mind: And <HI>G. Fox</HI> walking in his Chamber, heard a doleful Noise, and standing still to hearken, he heard him say to his Wife: <HI>Wife, I have seen the Day of Judgment, and I saw George there, and was afraid of him, because I had done him so much Wrong, and spoken so much against him to the Ministers, and Professors, and to the Justices, and in Tavern, and Alehouses.</HI> After this, towards the Evening the Keeper came up into his Chamber, and said to him, <HI>I have been as a Lion against you; but now I come like a Lamb, and like the</HI> Jailor <HI>that came to</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Silas <HI>trembling.</HI> And he desired that he might lie with him? To which <HI>G.

G. Fox</HI> unwilling to deny his Desire, comply'd with it, and suffered him to lie with him. Then the Keeper told him all his Heart, and said, <HI>He believed what he had said of the true Faith and Hope, to be true:</HI> And he wondered that the other Man that was put into Prison with him, did not stand to it; for, said he, <HI>That Man was not right, but you are an honest Man.</HI> He also confessed, that at those Times when <HI>G. Fox</HI> had asked him to let him go and speak the Word
<PB N="30" REF="003104_0041_0FEFF35A22906F38"/>
of the Lord to the People, and at his Refusal had laid the Weight thereof upon him, that then he used to be under great Trouble, ama∣zed, and almost distracted for some Time. The next Morning the Keeper being risen, went to the Justices, and told them, <HI>That he and his House had been plagued for</HI> G. Fox's <HI>Sake:</HI> To which one of the Ju∣ces, <HI>viz. Bennet,</HI> said, <HI>That the Plagues were on them too, for keeping him.</HI> The Justices now to be rid of him, gave Leave <HI>That he should have Li∣berty to walk a Mile.</HI> But he perceiving their End, told the Jailor, <HI>If they would set down to him how far a Mile was, he might take the Liberty of walking it sometimes:</HI> For he believed, they thought he would go away; and the Jailor also told him afterwards, that this was their Intent. But he signified to him that he had no Mind to get his Liberty that Way — And so he remained Prisoner, and was visited by the Jailor's Sister, who was so affected with what he spoke to her, that the coming down, told her Brother, <HI>They were an innocent People, that did no Hurt to any, but Good to all;</HI> and she desired that he might be treated civilly.</P>
<P>Now, since by Reason of his Restraint he had not the Opportunity of travelling about to declare the Doctrine of Truth, he to discharge himself, wrote the following Paper, and sent it forth for the Opening of People's Understandings in the Way of Truth, and directing them to the true Teacher in themselves.</P>

Therefore stand in the <HI>Faith</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ (who is the <HI>Author</HI> of the true <HI>Faith)</HI> and mind him; for he will discover the <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>Lusts</HI> and evil <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and vain <HI>Ima∣ginations,</HI> and how they are begotten, conceived and bred; and then how they are brought forth, and how every evil Member doth work. He will discover every <HI>Principle</HI> from its own <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Root.</HI></P>
<P>So mind the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Anointing,</HI> which is in you, to be taught by it, which will discover all Workings in you: And as he teacheth you, so obey and forsake; else you will not grow up in the <HI>Faith,</HI> nor in the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> where the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is received.

And <HI>Mercy</HI> doth tri∣umph in <HI>Judgment:</HI> And <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> doth bear the <HI>Judgment</HI> of the <HI>World</HI> in Patience. That which cannot bear the World's <HI>Judgment,</HI> is not the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> for <HI>Love</HI> beareth all Things, and is above the <HI>World's Judgment;</HI> for the <HI>World's Judgment</HI> is but Foolishness.

And some Men have the Nature or <HI>Tall sturdy Oaks,</HI> to flourish and spread in Wisdom and Strength, who are strong in Evil, which must perish, and come to the Fire. Thus the <HI>Evil</HI> is but <HI>one in all,</HI> but worketh many Ways; and whatsoever a Man's or Woman's <HI>Nature</HI> is addicted to, that is <HI>Outward,</HI> the <HI>Evil One</HI> will fit him with that, and will please his Nature and Appetit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to keep his Mind in his Inventions, and in the <HI>Creatures</HI> from the <HI>Creator.</HI> O therefore let not the <HI>Mind</HI> go forth from God; for if it do, it will be stained, and venomed, and cor∣rupted: And if the <HI>Mind</HI> go forth from the Lord, it is hard to bring it in again.

<P>Here the King confessed openly that his Father's House was guilty of great Crimes, and plainly signified, that the Nation indeed had been wronged by his Father's Behaviour; and he seemed to promise Amend∣ment, if he came to be restor'd.

He also said, <HI>His Colonel</HI> (which I take to be <HI>Barton) was as blind as</HI> Nebuchadnezzar, <HI>to cast the Servant of the Lord into Prison.</HI> This so incens'd his Colonel, that, when at the <HI>Worcester</HI> Fight, the two Armies lying near one another, two from the King's Army challenged any two of the Parliament's Army to fight with them, the said Colonel made Choice of him and another to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣swer the Challenge: And when in the Encounter his Companion was slain, he drove both his Enemies within a Musket-shot of the Town, without firing a Pistol at them. Thus he return'd victorious; but then he saw the Deceit of the Officers, and how wonderfully the Lord had preserved him; and in Process of Time becoming sensible that fighting was unlawful for a true Chrstian, he laid down his Arms, henceforth to fight under the Banner of the Prince of Peace, by entering into the Spiritual Warfare.</P>
<P>Now the Time of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Commitment to the House of Correction being very near out, and there being many new Soldiers raised, the Com∣missioners would have made him Captain over them, and the Soldiers cry'd, <HI>They would have none but him.</HI> So the Keeper of the House of Cor∣rection was commanded to bring him up before the Commissioners and Soldier's in the Market-place; and there they proffer'd him that Prefer∣ment, (as they call'd it) asking him if he would not take up Arms for the Common-wealth, against <HI>Charles Stuart? G. Fox,</HI> never having been a Fighter, tho' it has appeared that he was bold and valiant, told them. <Q>That he could not do so, as well knowing from whence all Wars did arise, (<HI>viz.</HI> from the Lusts, according to the Doctrine of the Apostle <HI>James)</HI> and that he lived in the Virtue of that Life and Power, that took away the Occasion of all Wars.</Q> The Commissioners, to fawn upon him, said, <HI>They offered him the Office in Love and Kindness, because
<PB N="38" REF="003104_0049_0FEFF36429C7A5F0"/>
of his Vertue.</HI> But he not mattering those flattering Words, reply'd, <Q>If this be your Love and Kindness, I trample it under my Feet.</Q> This bold Answer presently shew'd how shallow their pretended Kindness was; for it so enraged them, that they said, <HI>Take him away</HI>Jailer,<HI>and put him into the Dungeon amongst the Rogues and Felons.</HI> Thus <HI>G. Fox</HI> was put into a lousy stinking Place, amongst thirty Felons, where he had no Bed, and was kept almost half a Year, unless that at Times he was suf∣fered to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k in the Garden, for they believed of him that he would not run away. He now being in this nasty Prison, it was said among the People, that he never should come out: But he, trusting in God, be∣lieved the contrary, it being shewed him from the Lord (according to what he relates) that he was not yet to be removed from that Place, there being a Service for him to do.</P>
<P>In the mean while it was noised abroad, that he was in <HI>Darby-Dungeon,</HI> and his Relations came again to see him, they being much troubled about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they thought it a great Shame to them, that he should lie thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Besides, it was a strange Thing to be imprison'd for Religion. But some judged him to be mad, because he maintained the Doctrine of <HI>Purity, Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Perfection.</HI> Among others that came to see him, there was also a Soldier from <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who said to him, <HI>Your Faith stands in a Man that died at</HI> Jerusalem; <HI>and there was never any such Thing.</HI> This so grieved <HI>G. Fox,</HI> that he said to him, <HI>How▪ did not Christ suffer without the Gates of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>by the Professing</HI> Jews, <HI>the Chief Priest, and</HI> Pilate? <HI>No,</HI> said the other, <HI>he did not suffer there outwardly.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>Whether there were not</HI> Jews, <HI>Chief Priests, and</HI> Pilate <HI>outwardly?</HI> This puzzled the Soldier a little, so that he could not deny it. Then he told him, <HI>As certainly as there was a Chief Priest, and</HI> Jews, <HI>and</HI> Pilate, <HI>so certainly Christ did suffer there outwardly under them.</HI> Yet this inconside∣rate Person also said, <HI>That never any of the Prophets, or Apostles, or Holy Men of God, suffered any Thing outwardly; but that all their Sufferings were inward.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> instanced to him many of the Prophets and Apo∣stles, how they suffered, and by whom they suffered, thereby to con∣found his silly Imaginations. Yet such was the Malice of some, that a Slander was raised among the People, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>denied Christ that suffered and died at</HI> Jerusalem. This, indeed, is a singular Evidence of the Credu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity of People, taking upon Trust any Story, how false so∣ever, when it relates to those that are become the Object ot vulgar Odium. Now as <HI>G. Fox</HI> was often visited by those that came out of Curiosity, it is not to be wondered, that sometimes he was contradicted by presump∣tuous and self-concei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Persons. Once there came to him some that pretended they were Triers of Spirits;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Triers of Spi∣rits.</NOTE> and these he asked, <HI>What was the first Step to Peace? And what it was by which a Man might see his Salva∣tion?</HI> But they being or an airy Mind, took this to be such a strange Question, that they did not stick to say, <HI>He was mad.</HI> Thus it appear∣ed, that these who pretended to try Spirits, did not know what Spi∣rit they themselves were of, and that they had not sufficient Know∣ledge to make a good Judgment of the Corporal Constitution, saying he was mad, who was in no wise out of his Senses.</P>
<P>In the Time of his Imprisonment he was much exercised in Mind about the Proceedings of the Magistrates, because Men were put to Death for stealing of Cattle, Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he was the more troubled about it, because this Practice was contrary to the Law of God in old Time. Wherefore he writ the following two Letters to the Judges.</P>
<P><Q>I AM moved to write unto you to take Heed of putting Men to <HI>Death</HI> for stealing <HI>Cattel,</HI> or <HI>Money,</HI> &amp;c. for the <HI>Theives</HI> in the old

T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me were to make <HI>Restitution;</HI> and if they had not wherewithal, they were to be <HI>sold</HI> for their <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> Mind the <HI>Laws</HI> of God in the <HI>Scrip∣tures,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> that gave them forth; and let them be your <HI>Rule</HI> in executing <HI>Judgment:</HI> And shew <HI>Mercy,</HI> that you may receive <HI>Mercy</HI> from God, the <HI>Judge</HI> of all. And take Heed of <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Rewards,</HI> and of <HI>Pride,</HI> for God doth forbid them, and they do blind the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the <HI>Wise.</HI> I do not write to give Liberty to Sin; God hath for∣bidden it: But that you should <HI>judge</HI> according to his <HI>Laws,</HI> and shew <HI>Mercy:</HI> For he delighteth in true <HI>Judgment,</HI> and in <HI>Mercy.</HI> I beseech you to mind these Things, and prize your <HI>Time,</HI> now you have it; and fear God, and serve him; for he is a <HI>consuming Fire.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The other Letter was thus;</P>
<P><Q>I AM moved to write unto you, that ye do true <HI>Justice</HI> to every Man, and see that none be oppressed, nor wronged; nor no <HI>Oaths</HI> imposed; for the Land mourneth because of <HI>Oaths,</HI> and <HI>Adulteries,</HI> and <HI>Sorceries,</HI> and <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. O consider, ye that be Men set in Authority: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and in <HI>Lowliness</HI> consider these Things. Shew <HI>Mercy</HI> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>less, and to the Widows, and to the Poor: And take Heed of <HI>Rewards,</HI> or <HI>Gifts,</HI> for they do blind the Eyes of the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: The Lord doth loath all such. Love <HI>Mercy</HI> and true <HI>Judgment, Justice,</HI> and Righteousness, for the Lord delighteth in such. Consider these Things in Time, and take Heed how ye do spend your Time: Now ye have Time, prize it, and shew <HI>Mercy,</HI> that ye may receive <HI>Mercy</HI> from the Lord: For he is coming to try all Things, and will plead with all Flesh, as by Fire.</Q></P>
<P>Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was in Prison among the Felons, it grieved him to hear their foul Language; and he often reproved them for their wicked Words, and evil Carriage towards each other; and People did admire that he was so preserv'd among this bad Company, without being de∣filed by their Conversation: But the Fear of God so prevailed in his Heart, that he could not be charged with any evil Word or Action all the Time he was there: Yet he perceived that it was dangerous to con∣verse with such a naughty Crew, and therefore he laid before the Judges what an hurtful Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng it was, that Prisoners should lie long in Jail, because they learned Wickedness one of another, in talking of their bad Deeds; and that therefore speedy Justice ought to be done.</P>
<P>Now whilst he was confined here, there was a young Woman in the Jail for robbing her Master of some Money; and she being to be tried for her Life, he wrote concerning her to the Judge and Jury, shewing them, how contrary it was to the Law of God of old, to put People to Death for Stealing; and that it was an incumbent Duty to shew Mer∣cy. But notwithstanding his Writing so, she was condemned to die, and a Grave was made for her. <HI>G. Fox</HI> having heard this, writ a few Words, containing, <Q>A Warning for all People to beware of Covetousness, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear the Lord, and prize their Time, while they have it; that so they might avoid Wickedness.</Q> And when the Woman, at the Time appointed, was carried forth to Execution, he gave this Writing to be read at the Gallows; but when she was upon the Ladder, with a Cloth over her Face, and ready to be turned off, she was reprieved, and was brought back again to Prison, where afterwards she came to be convin∣ced of the Truth, as held forth by <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and his Friends.</P>
<P>In the Jail there was also detained a wicked Man, who was said to be a Conjurer; this Man threatned <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and also the Jailor, <HI>That he would raise the Devil, and break the House down;</HI> so that he made the
<PB N="40" REF="003104_0051_0FEFF36A53DCA010"/>
Jailor afraid. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to him, and said, <HI>Come, let's see what thou canst do, and do thy worst: The Devil is raised high enough in thee al∣ready; but the Power of God chains him down.</HI> At this undaunted Speech the Fellow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unk away.</P>
<P>Now the Justices to get rid of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> resolved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> press him for a Soldier, seeing he would not voluntarily accept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mand; and <HI>Bennet</HI> sent Constables to give him Press-Money: But he told them, <HI>That he was brought off from outward War, and was dead to it.</HI> And tho' the Com∣missioners over and again profered him Money, yet he would not take it; at which they grew so angry, that he was committed close Priso∣ner. Hereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> wrote to the Justices, and those that were con∣cerned in his Commitment, the following Lines.</P>
<P><Q>YOU, who are without <HI>Christ,</HI> and yet use the Words, which he and his <HI>Saints</HI> have spoken, Consider, neither he nor his <HI>Apostles</HI> did ever <HI>Imprison</HI> any; but my <HI>Saviour</HI> is <HI>Merciful</HI> even to the <HI>Ʋnmer∣ciful</HI> and <HI>Rebellious.</HI> He doth bring out of <HI>Prison</HI> and <HI>Bondage:</HI> But <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> while the <HI>carnal Mind</HI> doth rule, do <HI>Oppress</HI> and <HI>Imprison.</HI> My Savi∣our saith, <HI>Love your Enemies, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you:</HI> For the <HI>Love</HI> or <HI>God</HI> doth not persecute any; but loveth all, where it dwelleth: <HI>He that hateth his Brother, is a Murderer.</HI> You profess to be <HI>Christians,</HI> and one of you a <HI>Minister of Jesus Christ;</HI> yet you have <HI>Imprisoned</HI> me, who am a <HI>Servant</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> The Apostles never <HI>Imprisoned</HI> any; but were Imprisoned themselves: Take heed of speaking of <HI>Christ</HI> in Words, and denying him in Life and Power. O <HI>Friends,</HI> the <HI>Imprisoning</HI> my Body is to satisfy your <HI>Wills;</HI> but take heed of giving Way to your <HI>Wills,</HI> for that will hurt you. If the <HI>Love</HI> of God had broken your Hearts, ye would not have <HI>Imprisoned</HI> me; but my <HI>Love</HI> is to you, as to all my Fellow-Creatures; and that you may <HI>weigh</HI> your selves, and see how you stand, is this written.</Q></P>
<P>About this Time he gave forth a Paper to those that were convin∣ced of the Truth, to shew them the Deceit of the World, and how the Priests had deceived the People, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>CHRIST was ever hated; and the Righteous for his Sake. Mind, who they were, that did ever hate them. He that was born after the <HI>Flesh,</HI> did persecute him that was born after the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and so it is now. And mind, who were the Chiefest against <HI>Christ;</HI> even the great <HI>Learned Men,</HI> the Heads of the People, Rulers and Teach∣ers, that did profess the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and looked for <HI>Christ.</HI> They looked for an outwardly-glorious <HI>Christ,</HI> to hold up their out∣ward Glory: But <HI>Christ</HI> spake against the Works of the World; and against the <HI>Priests,</HI> and <HI>Scribes,</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and their hypocritical Profession. He that is a Stranger to Christ, is an <HI>Hireling;</HI> but the Servants of Jesus Christ are <HI>Freemen.</HI> The <HI>false Teachers</HI> always laid Burdens upon the People: And the <HI>true Servants</HI> of the Lord did speak against them. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> did speak against <HI>Hirelings,</HI> and said, <HI>It was an horrible Thing;</HI> and said, <HI>What will ye do in the End ?</HI> for the <HI>People</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> were given to <HI>Covetousness. Paul</HI> did speak against such, as did make <HI>Gain</HI> upon the <HI>People;</HI> and exhorted the Saints to turn away from such as were <HI>Covetous Men</HI> and <HI>Proud Men,</HI> such as did love <HI>Pleasures</HI> more than God; such as had a <HI>Form</HI> of Godliness, but deni∣ed the <HI>Power</HI> thereof. For of this sort (said he) are they, that <HI>Creep into Houses, and lead Captive silly Women, who are ever learning, but never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth; Men of corrupt Minds, Reprobrate

concerning the Faith; and as</HI> Jannes <HI>and</HI> Jambres <HI>withstood</HI> Moses, <HI>so</HI> (saith he) <HI>do these Resist the Truth: but they shall proceed no further, for their Folly shall be made manifest unto all Men. Moses</HI> forlook <HI>Honours</HI> and <HI>Pleasures,</HI> which he might have enjoyed. The Apostle in his Time saw this <HI>Corruption</HI> entring, which now is spread over the World, of having a <HI>Form</HI> of Godliness, but denying the <HI>Power.</HI> Ask any of your <HI>Teachers,</HI> whether you may ever overcome your Corruptions or <HI>Sins?</HI> None of them doth believe That; but <HI>as long as Man is here, he must</HI> (they say) <HI>carry about with him the Body of Sin.</HI> Thus <HI>Pride</HI> is kept up, and that Honour and Mastership, which Christ de∣nied; and all Unrighteousness: Yet Multitudes of <HI>Teachers;</HI> Heaps of <HI>Teachers;</HI> the Golden Cup full of <HI>Abominations! Paul</HI> did not preach for <HI>Wages;</HI> but laboured with his Hands, that he might be an <HI>Ex∣ample</HI> to all them that follow him. O People, see who follows <HI>Paul!</HI> The Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> said, <HI>The Prophets prophesy falsely, and the Priests bear Rule by their Means;</HI> but now the <HI>Priests bear Rule</HI> by the <HI>Means</HI> they get from the <HI>People:</HI> Take away their <HI>Means,</HI> and they will bear <HI>Rule</HI> over you no longer. They are such as, the Apostle said, <HI>Intruded</HI> into those Things, which they never <HI>saw;</HI> being vainly puffed up with a fleshly Mind; and, as the Scriptures declare of some of old, <HI>They go in the Way of</HI> Cain, (who was a Murderer) <HI>and in the Way of</HI> Balaam, <HI>who coveted the Wages of Ʋnrighteousness.</HI> The Prophet <HI>Micah</HI> also cried against the <HI>Judges,</HI> that Judged for <HI>Reward;</HI> and the <HI>Priests,</HI> that taught for <HI>Hire;</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> that prophesied for <HI>Money;</HI> and yet <HI>leaned on the Lord,</HI> saying; <HI>Is not the Lord amongst us? Gifts</HI> do blind the Eyes of the Wise: And the <HI>Gift</HI> of God was never pur∣chased with <HI>Money:</HI> All the holy Servants of God did ever cry against <HI>Deceit:</HI> And where the Lord hath manifested his Love, they do loath it, and that Nature, which holdeth it up.</Q></P>
<P>He also wrote a serious Exhortation to the Magistrates of <HI>Darby,</HI> to consider whom they imprisoned:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Desire you to consider in Time, whom ye do <HI>Imprison:</HI> for the <HI>Ma∣gistrate</HI> is set for the Punishment of <HI>Evil Doers,</HI> and for the Praise o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them that <HI>do well.</HI> But when the Lord doth send his Messengers unto you, to warn you of the <HI>Woes</HI> that will come upon you, except you <HI>Repent;</HI> then you <HI>persecute</HI> them, and put them into <HI>Prison,</HI> and say, <HI>We have a Law, and by our Law we may do it.</HI> For you indeed Justifie your selves before <HI>Men;</HI> but God knoweth your Hearts: He will not be worshipped with your <HI>Forms</HI> and <HI>Professions,</HI> and <HI>Shews</HI> of Religion. Therefore Consider, ye that talk of God, how ye are subject to him; for they are his <HI>Children,</HI> that do his <HI>Will.</HI> What doth the Lord re∣quire of you, but <HI>to do Justice, to love and shew Mercy, to walk humbly</HI> with him, and to help the Widows and Fatherless to their Right? But instead thereof ye <HI>Oppress</HI> the <HI>Poor?</HI> Do not your <HI>Judges</HI> judge for <HI>Rewards,</HI> and your <HI>Priests</HI> Teach for <HI>Hire?</HI> The Time is coming, that he who seeth all Things, will discover all your Secrets. And know this assuredly, The Lord will deliver his Servants out of your Hands, and he will recompence all your <HI>unjust Dealings</HI> towards his People. I desire you to Consider of these Things, and <HI>search the Scriptures,</HI> and see, whether any of the <HI>People</HI> of God did ever <HI>Imprison</HI> any for <HI>Religion;</HI> but were themselves <HI>Imprisoned.</HI> I desire you to Consider, how it is written, that when the <HI>Church</HI> is met together, they may <HI>all Prophesy, one by one;</HI> that all may hear, and all may

<P>During his Imprisonment there; he was under a great Exercise and Travel in Spirit, because of the Wickedness of that Town; for tho' some were convinced there of the Doctrine of Truth, yet generally they were a hardened People. And he seeing the Visitation of God's Love pass away from them, he mourned, and wrote following Lamentation.</P>
<P><Q>O <HI>Darby!</HI> As the <HI>Waters</HI> run away, when the Flood-Gates are up; so doth the <HI>Visitation</HI> of God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Love</HI> pass away from thee, O <HI>Darby!</HI> Therefore look, where thou art, and how thou art grounded; and Consider, before thou art utterly <HI>forsaken.</HI> The Lord moved me <HI>Twice,</HI> before I came to Cry against the <HI>Deceits</HI> and <HI>Vanities</HI> that are in thee: and to warn all to look at the <HI>Lord,</HI> and not at <HI>Man.</HI> The <HI>Wo</HI> is against the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Pride,</HI> and the <HI>Wo</HI> is against <HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>vain</HI> Pleasures, and against them that make a <HI>Profession</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> in Words, and are high and lofty in Mind, and live in <HI>Oppression</HI> and <HI>Envy.</HI> O <HI>Darby!</HI> thy <HI>Profession</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> stinks before the Lord.

<P>After he had written this, he perceived that his imprisonment there would not continue long; for the Magistrates grew uneasy about him, and could not agree what to do with him: One while they would have sent him up to the Parliament, and another while they would have banish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him to <HI>Ireland.</HI> At first they called him a Deceiver, and a Blasphemer; and afterwards, when the Judgments of God be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el them, they said he was an honest, virtuous Man. But their well or ill-speaking was nothing to him; for the one did not lift him up; nor did the other cast him down. At length they turned him out of Jail about the Beginning of the Winter, in the Year 1651, after he had been Prisoner in <HI>Darby</HI> about a Yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, six Months whereof in the House of Correction, and the rest of the Time in the common Jail and Dungeon.

<PB N="43" REF="003104_0054_0FEFF373EC842DE0"/>
again, and from thence into <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> where having visited his Friends, he passed into <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and coming into <HI>Doncaster,</HI> and other Places, he preached Repentance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yorkshire.

Fox</HI> spoke to the Congregation, and said, that <HI>They ought to turn to Christ Jesus as their Teacher.</HI> This struck a Dread amongst the People, and the Mayor spoke to him; but none meddled with him. In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-house, about two Miles off, where, after the Priest had done, he spoke to him and the People, shewing them the Way of Life and Truth, and the Ground of Election and Reprobation. The Priest saying he could not dispute, <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <Q>He did not come to dispute, but to hold forth the Word of Truth, that they might all know the one Seed, to which the Promise was, both in the Male, and in the Female.</Q> Here his speaking did so please the Auditory, that he was desired to come again on another Day, and to preach there. But he directed them to their Teacher Christ Jesus, and so went away. The next Day he came to <HI>Crantsick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crantsick. Capt. Pursloe. Justice Ho∣tham.</NOTE> to Captain <HI>Pursloe</HI>'s, who accom∣panied him to Justice <HI>Hotham</HI>'s, and entring into Discourse with <HI>G. Fox,</HI> told him, <Q>He had known that Principle about ten Years, and was glad that the Lord did publish it abroad among the People.</Q> While <HI>G. Fox</HI> was there, there came a great Woman of <HI>Beverly</HI> to speak with the said Justice about some Business, who in Discourse said, <Q>That the last Sab∣bath-Day (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he called it) there was an Angel or Spirit came into the Church at <HI>Beverly,</HI> and spoke the wonderful Things of God, to the Astonishment of all that were there: And that when it had done, it passed away, they not knowing whence it came, nor whither it went; but it astonished all, both Priest and Professors, and the Magistrates of the Town.</Q> This Relation Justice <HI>Hotham</HI> gave him afterwards; and then <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, that it was he who had been that Day at <HI>Beverly</HI> Steeple-house, and had declar'd Truth there. The next first Day of the Week Captain <HI>Pursloe</HI> came to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and they both went to the Steeple-house, where <HI>G. Fox,</HI> when the Priest had done, spoke to both Priest and People, and directed them where they might find their Teacher, the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>viz.</HI> inwardly, in their Hearts; which was of such Effect, that some received that Doctrine of Truth, and continued in it. In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-house, about three Miles off, where one preached that bore the Title of <HI>Doctor:</HI> He took his Text from <HI>Isaiah</HI> LV. <HI>Every one that thirst∣eth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money, without Price. G. Fox</HI> staid till the Priest had done, and well knowing what kind of Teacher he was, he was kindled with such a Zeal, that he said, <HI>Come down thou Deceiver: Dost thou bid People come freely, and take of the Water of Life freely, and yet thou takest three Hundred Pounds a Year of them! May'st not thou blush with Shame! Did the Prophet</HI> Isaiah <HI>and Christ do so, who spake the Words, and gave them forth freely? Did not Christ say to his Ministers, whom he sent
<PB N="44" REF="003104_0055_0FEFF3774C54B148"/>
to preach, Freely ye have received, freely give?</HI> The Priest being amazed, hastened away, and so gave <HI>G. Fox</HI> as much Time as he could desire, to speak to the People; who then directed them to the Light, and the Grace of God, and to the Spirit of God in their inward Parts, to be taught and instructed thereby.</P>
<P>Having thus cleared himself amongst that People, he return'd to Justice <HI>Hotham</HI>'s House that Night, who embracing him, said, <HI>My House is your House;</HI> and also signified, <HI>that he was exceeding glad at the Work of the Lord, and that his Power was revealed.</HI></P>
<P>From thence <HI>G. Fox</HI> went thro' the Country, and came at Night to an Inn, where he bid the Woman of the House, if she had any Meat, to bring him some. But because he said <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to her, she look∣ed strangely on him. Then he asked her, if she had any Milk? and she said, <HI>No:</HI> He believing she spoke falsely, and seeing a Churn stand in the Room, would try her farther, and asked h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, <HI>If she had any Cream?</HI> But she denied that she had any. Then a little Boy playing about the Churn, put his Hands into it, and pulling it down, threw all the Cream on the Floor. Thus the Woman appeared to be a Lyar, and she being amazed, took up the Child, and whipt it sorely: But he reproved her for her Lying, and going out of the House, went away, and that Night lay in a
Stack of Hay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">York.</NOTE> in Rain and Snow. The next Day he came to <HI>York;</HI> and the first Day of the Week being come, he went to the Cathedral: When the Priest had done, he said, <HI>He had something from the Lord God to speak to the Priest and People.</HI> Then said a Professor, <HI>Say on quickly;</HI> for it was very cold Weather. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them, <HI>This was the Word of the Lord God unto them, that they lived in Words; but God Al∣mighty looked for Fruits among them.</HI> As soon as these Words were out of his Mouth, he was hurried out, and thrown down the Steps. But he got up again without Hurt, and went to his Lodging. Yet several of the People were so reach'd that they became convinced of the Truth.</P>
<P>He having now done his Service in <HI>York,</HI> went from thence, and came the next Day to <HI>Burraby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Burraby.</NOTE> and coming into a certain Meeting, where there was a Priest also, he had Occasion to declare the Truth, and many were convinced; and the Priest himself confessed to the Truth, tho' he came not to live up to it. The following Day <HI>G. Fox</HI> passed to <HI>Cleave∣land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cleaveland.</NOTE> where having a Meeting, some were convinced. The first Day of the next Week he went to the Steeple-house, and when the Priest had done, he directed the People to their Teacher w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hin, Christ Jesus, who had bought them. The Priest then coming to him, he had a little Dis∣course with him, and put him soon to Silence.</P>
<P>From thence he wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>Stath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stath.</NOTE> where he had great Meetings, and many received the Truth he preached; amongst whom was <HI>Philip Scarth</HI> a Priest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. Scarth.</NOTE> that afterwards came to be a Minister of the Gospel among those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who now began thereabout to encrease in Number, and had great Meetings. It happened here that a certain <HI>Scotch</HI> Priest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch Priest.</NOTE> walking with <HI>G. Fox,</HI> asked him many Questions concern∣ing the Light, and the Soul: to all which he answered fully: But after they parted, this <HI>Scotch</HI> Priest met <HI>Philip Scarth,</HI> and breaking his Cane against the Ground, said in Anger, <HI>If ever he met with</HI> G. Fox <HI>again, he would have his Life, or</HI> Fox <HI>should have his;</HI> adding, <HI>that he would give his Head, if</HI> G. Fox <HI>was not knockt down within a Month.</HI> Yet what is mar∣vellous, this same <HI>Scotch</HI> Priest, after some Years, came to be one or the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and afterwards <HI>G. Fox</HI> visited him at his House. Not much unlike to this, was, that a Woman of Note among the <HI>Inde∣pendents,</HI> being swayed by Prejudice against <HI>G Fox,</HI> said, <HI>She would wil∣lingly have gone to have seen him hang'd:</HI> But when she heard him preach,
<PB N="45" REF="003104_0056_0FEFF37A0D8891B0"/>
she was so reach'd, that the being convinced of the Truth he declared, came to be one of his Friends. Oftentimes he had Opportunity to speak with the Priests, who, when they heard of his coming, would hide them∣selves; for it was a dreadful Thing to them, when it was told them, <HI>The Man in Leather Breeches is come;</HI> for this was indeed his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess in those Days, not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of any Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, but because Leather Clothes being strong, it was not unsuitable for one that travelled so much as he did.</P>
<P>He now coming to <HI>Malton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Malton.</NOTE> had great Meetings; but it was thought such a strange Thing to preach in Houses, that many du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st not come there, for Fear of their Relations; and therefore he was much desired to come and preach in the Churches, as the Steeple-houses are commonly called:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Priest</HI> Boyes.</NOTE> Nay, one of the Priests himself, called <HI>Boyes,</HI> (who was so taken with him, that he called him Brother) did invite him to preach in his Steeple-house: But <HI>G. Fox</HI> had little Inclination to that, because both Priests and People called that Place of Worship, <HI>The House of God;</HI> where∣as the Apostle said to the <HI>Athenians, God dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands:</HI> And therefore he endeavoured to draw People o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f from them, and to make them sensible, that God and Christ ought to dwell in their Hearts, that so their Bodies might be made the Temples of God. Yet for that Time he went into the Steeple-house at <HI>Malton,</HI> where there were not above eleven Hearers, to whom the Priest was Preaching; but after it was known in the Town that <HI>G. Fox</HI> was there, it was soon filled with People. And when the Priest had done, he sent the other that had invited him thither, to bring him up into the Pulpit. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> sent him Word, <HI>That he needed not to go into the Pulpit.</HI> The Priest not satisfy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with this Refusal, sent again, desiring him to go up into it, for, said he, <HI>It is a better Plate to be seen of the People:</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> answered, <HI>That he could be seen and heard well enough where he was; and that he came not there to hold up such Places, nor their Maintenance and Trade.</HI> This created some Displeasure, and it was said, <HI>That false Prophets were to come in the last Times:</HI> But this Saying grieved many of the People, and some began to murmur at it▪ Whereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> stood up, and de∣siring all to be quiet, he st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt upon an high Seat; and since somewhat had been spoken of <HI>False Prophets,</HI> he declared to the Auditory, the Marks of those Prophets, and he shewed, That they were already come, and were out of the Steps of the true Prophets, and of Christ and his Apostles. He also directed the People to their inward Teacher, Christ Jesus, who would turn them from Darkness to Light: And ha∣ving opened divers Scriptures to them, he directed them to the Spirit of God in themselves, by which they might come to God, and also come to know who the false Prophets were. And having thus had a large Time to preach to the People, he went away without any Disturbance.</P>
<P>After some Time he came to <HI>Pickering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pickering.</NOTE> where the Justices held their Sessions in the Steeple-house; Justice <HI>Robinson</HI> being Chairman. At the same Time <HI>G. Fox</HI> had a Meeting in the School-house, where many Priests and Professors came, and asked several Questions, which were answered to their Satisfaction, so that many Persons, and amongst these, four chief Constables, were convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that Day; and Word was carried to Justice <HI>Robinson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Justice</HI> Ro∣binson.</NOTE> that his Priest, whom he loved more than all the others, was over thrown and convinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. After the Meeting was done, they went to an Inn, and the said Priest was very loving, and would have paid for <HI>G. Fox</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Dinner; but this he would not suffer by any Means. Then he offer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that he should have his Steeple-house to preach in; but he re∣fused, and told him and the People, <HI>That he came to bring them off from such Things to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rist.</HI> The next Morning he went with the four chief Constables to visit Justice <HI>Robinson,</HI> who meeting him at his Chamber-Door,
<PB N="46" REF="003104_0057_0FEFF37BACD1B1A0"/>
<HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>He could not honour him with Man's Honour:</HI> To which the Justice said, <HI>He did not look for it.</HI> Then he went into his Chamber, and spoke to him concerning the State of the False Prophets, and of the True; and also concerning Election and Reprobation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew∣ing that Reprobation stood in the First Birth, and Election in the Se∣cond; and what it was that the Promise of God was to, and what the Judgment of God was against. All this so pleased the said <HI>Robinson,</HI> that he not only confessed it to be Truth; but when another Justice that was present, made some little Opposition, he informed him; and at their Parting, he said to <HI>G. Fox, It was very well that he did exercise that Gift which God had given him.</HI> And he took the chief Constables aside, and would have given them some Money for <HI>G. Fox,</HI> saying, <HI>He would not have him to be at any Charge in their Country:</HI> But they told him, That they themselves could not get him to take any Money. <HI>G. Fox</HI> passing from thence, Priest <HI>Boyes</HI> went along with him. But the Year being now come to an End, let us take a short View how it stood with State-Affairs.</P>
<P>It hath been said already,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Transactions.</NOTE> that <HI>Charles</HI> the II. had been crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d King by the <HI>Scots;</HI> but having been beaten, with his Forces, by <HI>Cromwel,</HI> he marched afterwards with a new Army into <HI>England,</HI> and took <HI>Worcester</HI> without Opposition: Yet, in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> his Forces were so entirely routed by <HI>Cromwel,</HI> that King <HI>Charles,</HI> to prevent being taken Prisoner after the Battle, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself a whole Day in a ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low Oak; and afterwards, being clothed like a Servant, and called by Name of <HI>William,</HI> passed the Country, and thro' many Hazards escaped out of <HI>England,</HI> and arrived on the Coast of <HI>Normandy</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where we will leave him to return again to <HI>G. Fox;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Priest</HI> Boyes.</NOTE> who coming with Priest <HI>Boyes</HI> into a Town to bait, and hearing the Bells ring, asked what that was for: They told him, <HI>That it was for him to preach in the Steeple-house.</HI> Walking thither, he saw the People were gathered together in the Stee∣ple-house Yard. The Priest who accompanied him, would have had him to go into the Steeple-house: But he said, <HI>It was no Matter.</HI> This seemed strange to the People, that he would not go into that which they call'd <HI>the House of God.</HI> But he stood up in the Steeple-house Yard, and declared to them, <Q>That he came not to hold up their Idol-Temples, nor their Priests, nor their Tythes, nor their Jewish and Heathenish Ceremonies: That the Ground on which these their Temples stood, was no more Holy than any other Piece of Ground: That the Apo∣stles going into the <HI>Jews</HI> Synagogues and Temples, was to bring Peo∣ple off from that Temple, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from the Offerings and Tythes, and covetous Priests of that Time: That such who came to be converted, and believed in Christ, afterwards met together in Dwelling-houses: And that all who preach Christ, the Word of Life, ought to preach freely, as the Apostles did, and as Christ had commanded: And that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth had sent him to preach freely, and to bring People off from the outward Temples made with Hands, in which God dwelleth not; that so they might know their Bodies were to become the Temples of God and Christ. Moreover, that they ought to leave all their superstitious Ceremonies, Traditions, and Doctrines of Men; and not regard such Teachers of the World, that took Tythes, and great Wages, <HI>preaching for Hire, and divining for Money,</HI> whom God and Christ never sent, according to their own Confession, when they say, They never heard God's Voice. That therefore People ought to come to the Spirit and Grace of God in themselves, and to the Light of Jesus in their own Hearts; that so they might come to know Christ their free Teacher, to bring them Salvation, and to open the Scriptures to them.</Q> This Speech had
<PB N="47" REF="003104_0058_0FEFF37F961F6BF0"/>
such Effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1652</NOTE> that many then declared they were convinced of the Truth.</P>
<P>From this Place he went to another Town, and Priest <HI>Boyes</HI> went a∣long with him. Thither came several Professors, but h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sate silent for some Hours; which made them often ask the Priest, <HI>When will he begin? When will he speak?</HI> To which the Priest said, <HI>Wait:</HI> And told them, <HI>That the People waited upon Christ a long while before he spake.</HI> Now tho' <HI>G. Fox</HI> by Silence was to famish People from Words, yet at length he felt himself moved to speak, which he did so effectually, that many were reached, and there was a general Convincement amongst them.</P>
<P>From hence he passed on, the Priest continuing to go with him, as did several others. And as they went along, some People called to the Priest, and said, Mr. <HI>Boyes, We owe you some Money for Tythes, pray come and take it.</HI> But he throwing up his Hands, said, <HI>He had enough, and would have none of it; they might keep it; and he praised the Lord he had enough.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moors.</NOTE> At length they came to this Priest's Steeple-house in the <HI>Moors;</HI> and when they came into it, the Priest went before, and held open the Pulpit-Door: But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, he would not go into it. And this Steeple-house being very much painted, he told him, and the People, That the <HI>painted Beast had a painted House.</HI> Then he spoke to them con∣cerning the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of all those Houses, and their superstitious Ways; and he told them, <Q>That at the End of the Apostle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s going into the Temple and Synagogues, was not to hold them up, but to bring People to Christ the Substance; so the End of his Coming there was not to hold up these Temples, Priests, and Tythes, but to bring them off from all these Things to Christ the Substance. Moreover, he de∣clared to them what the true Worship was, which Christ had set up; and he distinguished Christ, the true Way, from all the false Ways, opening the Parables to them, and turning them from Darkness to the true Light, that by it they might see themselves and their Sins, and Christ their Saviour; that so believing in him, they might be saved from their Sins.</Q></P>
<P>After this he went to the House of one <HI>Birde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Birde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> where he had a great Meeting, and the Priest <HI>Boyes</HI> accompanied him still, leaving his Steeple-house. Then he returned towards <HI>Crantsick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crantsick.</NOTE> to Captain <HI>Pursloe</HI>'s and Ju∣stice <HI>Hotham</HI>'s, who received him kindly, being glad that Truth was spread, and so many had received it. And Justice <HI>Hotham</HI> said, <Q>If God had not raised up this Principle of Light and Life, which <HI>G. Fox</HI> preached, the Nation had been over-run with <HI>Ranterism,</HI> and all the Justices in the Nation could not have stopped it with all their Laws: Because (said he) they would have said as we said, and done as we commanded, and yet have kept their old Principle still: But this Principle or Truth overthrows their Principle, and the Root <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Ground thereof.</Q></P>
<P>Now tho' <HI>G. Fox</HI> found good Entertainment, yet he did not settle these, but kept in a continual Motion, going from one Place to another, to beget Souls unto God. I don't intend to relate all his Occurrences, but will give a short Hint only of some of the Chief.</P>
<P>Coming then towards Night into <HI>Patrington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Patrington.</NOTE> he walked thro' the Town, and meeting the Priest in the Street, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed both him and the People to <HI>repent, and turn to Lord:</HI> And People gathering about him, he declared to them the Word of Life, directing them to the inward Word, <HI>viz.</HI> the Light wherewith they were enlighten'd. And going afterwards to an Inn, for it was dark, he desired Lodging; but it was denied him: Then he asked for a little Meat, or Milk, offering to pay for it; But this also was refused him. Being thus put off; he
<PB N="48" REF="003104_0059_0FEFF381D2141CE0"/>
walked out of the Town, and some rude Fellows follo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, asked him, <HI>What News?</HI> To which his Answer was, <HI>Repent and fear the Lord.</HI> After he was gone a pretty Way out of the Town, he ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to another House, where he desired to have some Meat, Drink, and Lodging for his Mo∣ney; but they would not suffer him to stay there: Then he went to another House, but met with the like Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usal. By this Time it was grown so dark, that he could not see the High-way, but perceiving a Ditch, he got a little Water, and so refreshed himself. Then he got over the Ditch, and being weary, he sat down amongst the Furz-bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, till it grew Day; and tnen he got up, and passing on thro' the Fields, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man came after him with a Pike-sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, and went along with him to a Town, where he raised the People, with the Constable and chief Con∣stable, before the Sun was up. <HI>G. Fox,</HI> seeing the Multitude, warned them of the Day of the Lord that was coming upon all S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and Wick∣edness, and exhorted them to repent. But they laying hold on him, carried him back to <HI>Patrington,</HI> and guarded him with Halberds, Pikes, Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Being come to the said Town, all was in an Uproar; and the Priest and Constable consulting together what to do with him, he too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Opportunity to exhort the People to Repentance, and to preach the Word of Life to them. At last a discreet Man called him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto his House, where he got some Milk and Bread, not having eaten for some Days before. Then he was carried about nine Miles to a Ju∣stice; and when he was come near his House, there came a Man riding a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and asked him, <HI>Whether he was the Man that was apprehended? G. Fox</HI> asking him <HI>Why?</HI> The other said, <HI>For no Hurt.</HI> Then he told him, <HI>He was;</HI> and so the Man rode away to the Justice. Now the Men that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>It would be well, if the Justice was not drunk when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y came to him, because he used to be drunk early. G. Fox</HI> being now brought in before him, and not putting off his Hat, and saying <HI>Thou</HI> to him, the Justice asked the Man that rode thither before, <HI>Whether he was not mazed, or fond?</HI> But the Man said, <HI>No; It is his Principle so to behave himself.</HI> Now <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who was unwilling to let any Opportunity slip, without admonishing People to Vertue, warned the Justice to <HI>repent,</HI> and bid him <Q>Come to the Light which Christ had enlightned him with, that by it he might see all his evil Words and Actions, and so return to Christ Jesus whilst he had Time, and that he ought to prize that Time.</Q> <HI>Ay, Ay,</HI> said he, <HI>the Light that is spoken of in the Third of</HI> John. <HI>G. Fox</HI> desired him that he would mind it, and obey it; and laying his Hand upon, him, he was so brought down by the Lord's Power, that all the Watchmen stood amazed. Then he took <HI>G. Fox</HI> with him into a Parlour with the other Men, and desired to see what he had in his Pockets, of Letters, or Intelligence; for it seems they suspected him to be an Enemy to the Common-wealth. Then he pulled out his Linnen, and shewed that he had no Letters; which made the Justice say, <HI>He is not a Vagrant, by his Linnen;</HI> and set him at Liberty. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> went back, to <HI>Patrington</HI> again, with that Man who had rid before to the Justice, and who lived in that Town. Coming to his House, he desired <HI>G. Fox</HI> to go to Bed, or to <HI>lye doan upon it:</HI> Which he did, that they might say, they had seen him in a Bed, or upon a Bed; for there was a Report, that he would not lie on any Bed, raised doubtless, be∣cause about that Time he had lain often without Doors</P>
<P>When the First Day of the Week was come, he went to the Steeple-house, and declared the Doctrine of Truth to the Priest and People, without being mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested. Then presently after he had a great Meeting at that Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s House where he lay, and many were convinced that Day of the Truth he preached; and they were exceeding sorry that they
<PB N="49" REF="003104_0060_0FEFF384B6E9EC20"/>
had not given him Lodging when he was there before. From thence he travelled thro' the Country, warning People, both in Towns, and in Country-Villages, to <HI>repent,</HI> and turn to Christ Jesus their Teacher.</P>
<P>On a First Day of the Week he came to one Colonel <HI>Overton</HI>'s House,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.</HI> Overton.</NOTE> and had a great Meeting of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ef of the People of that Country; where he opened many Things out of the Scriptures, which they never heard before▪ Coming afterwards again to <HI>Patrington,</HI> he understood that a Taylor, and some wild Blades in that Town, had occasioned his being carried before the Justice: This Taylor came to ask him For∣giveness, fearing he would complain of him: The Constables also were afraid, lest he should trouble them: But he forgave them all, and ex∣horted them to turn to the Lord, and to amend their Lives. Now that which made them the more afraid, was, that he having been not long before in the Steeple-house at <HI>Oram,</HI> there came a Professor that gave him a Push on the Breast, and bid him, <HI>Get out of the Church.</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>Dost thou call the Steeple-house the Church? The Church is the People, whom God hath purchased with his Blood, and not the House.</HI> But Justice <HI>Hotham</HI> having heard of this Man's thus abusing <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Just.</HI> Ho∣tham.</NOTE> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t a Warrant, and bound the said Man over to the Sessions. So zealous was this Justice to keep the Peace, that he had asked <HI>G. Fox</HI> before, whether any People had abused him: But he esteeming it his Duty to forgive all, told him nothing of that Kind.</P>
<P>From <HI>Patrington</HI> he went to several great Mens Houses, warning them to repent. Some received him lovingly, and some slighted him. Passing thus thro' the Country, at Night he came to another Town, where he desired Lodging and Meat, offering to pay for it; but they would not lodge him, unless he went to a Constable to ask Leave, which they said was the Custom of Strangers. But he told them, <HI>That Custom was for suspected Persons, and not for such as he, who was an innocent Man.</HI> So after he had warned them to repent, and to mind the Day of their Visitation, and directed them to me Light of Christ, and Spirit of God, he passed away. As it grew dark, he spied an Hay-stack, and went and sat under it till Morning. The next Day he came to <HI>Hull,</HI> where he admonished the People to turn to Christ Jesus, that they might re∣ceive Salvation. And being very weary with travelling on Foot so far, he got that Night a Lodging there.</P>
<P>From thence he went to <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nottingham∣shire. Lincolnshire. Gainsbo∣rough.</NOTE> visiting his Friends there; and so passed into <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where he did the like. And coming to <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> where one of his Friends had been preaching in the Mar∣ket, he found the Town and People all in an Uproar; the more, be∣cause a certain Man had raised a false Accusation, reporting, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had said, <HI>He was Christ.</HI> Here going into the House of a friendly Man, the People rushed in after him, so that the House soon was f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣led; and amongst the rest was also this false Accuser, who said openly before all the People, <HI>That</HI> G. Fox <HI>said he was Christ; and that he had got Witnesses to prove the same. G. Fox</HI> kindled with Zeal, stept upon the Table, and said to the People, <HI>That Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates; and that it was Christ the eternal Power of God, that spoke in him at that Time unto them; not that he was Christ.</HI> This gave general Sa∣tisfaction, except to the false Accuser himself, to whom <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>That he was a</HI> Judas, <HI>and that</HI> Judas<HI>'s End should be his; and that</HI> That <HI>was the Word of the Lord thro' him</HI> [Fox] <HI>to him.</HI> The Minds of the People com∣ing thus to be quieted, they departed peaceably. But very remarkable it was, <HI>This</HI> Judas <HI>shortly after hanged himself, and a Stake was driven into his Grave.</HI> Now tho' this was a well known Thing in this Country, yet some Priests spread a Report, <HI>That a</HI> Quaker <HI>had hanged himself in</HI> Lin∣colnshire,
<PB N="50" REF="003104_0061_0FEFF386E980CD38"/>
<HI>and had a Stake driven thro' him.</HI> And tho' this was taken up∣on Trust by Hearsay, yet, out of meer Malice, a certain Priest gave out this Falshood in Print, as a true Matter. But this wicked Slander prevailed so little, that many People in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> were convinced of the Truth preached by <HI>G. Fox.</HI></P>
<P>After this he passed into <HI>Yorkshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yorkshire. Warnsworth.</NOTE> and coming to <HI>Warnsworth,</HI> went to the Steeple-house in the Forenoon, but found no Acceptance; and being th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out, he was sorely beaten with Staves, and Clods and Stones were thrown at him; yet he exhorted to repent and turn to Christ. In the Afternoon he went to another Steeple-house; but the Sermon was finished before he got thither; so he preached Repentance to the Peo∣ple that were not departed, and directed them to their inward Teacher, Christ Jesus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doncaster.</NOTE> From hence he came to <HI>Doncaster,</HI> where he had formerly preached in the Market; but now on the First Day of the Week he went into the Steeple-house; and after the Priest had done, he began to speak, but was hurried out, and haled before the Magistrates, who threatned him with Death, if ever he came thither again. But not∣withstanding all this, <HI>G. Fox</HI> bid them <HI>Mind the Light of Christ in them,</HI> saying, <HI>That God was come to teach his People himself, whether they would hear or not.</HI> After a while being put out with some of his Friends, that were with him, they were stoned by the rude Multitude. A certain Innkeeper, that was a Bailiff, seeing this, came and took them into his House, but one of the Stones, that were thrown, hit his Head, so that the Blood ran down his Face. The next First Day <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Tichhil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tichhil.</NOTE> where he went into the Steeple-house, and there found the Priest, and the Chief of the Parish in the Chancel, to whom he began to speak; but they immediately fell upon him, and the Clark struck him with his Bible so violently on the Face, that the Blood gushed out, and he bled exceedingly. Then the People thrust him out of the Steeple-House, and beating him, threw him down, and dragged him along the Street, so that he became besmeared with Blood and Dirt, and his Hat was taken away. When he was got up again, he spoke to the People, and shewed them how they dishonoured Christianity. Some Time after the Priest coming by, scossingly called <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Friends, <HI>Quakers.</HI> But he was spoken to, in such an Authority and Dread, that he fell a trembling; which made one of the People say, <HI>Look how the Priest trem∣bles and shakes, he is turned a</HI> Quaker <HI>also.</HI> Some moderate Justices now, hearing how <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Friends had been abused, came to examine the Business; and the <HI>Clark</HI> was afraid of having his Hand cut off, for striking him in the Church: But <HI>G. Fox,</HI> as a true Christian, forgave him, and would not appear against him.</P>
<P>Thus far <HI>G. Fox</HI> only hath been mentioned as a Preacher of Repen∣tance; but now some others of his Perswasion began also to preach publickly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Aldam. R. Farns∣worth. W. Dewsbu∣ry. Warnsworth.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Thomas Aldam, Richard Farnsworth,</HI> and, not long after, <HI>William Dewsbury.</HI> This made such a Stir, that the Priest of <HI>Warnsworth</HI> produced a Warrant from the Justices against <HI>G. Fox</HI> and <HI>Thomas Al∣dam.</HI> The Constable, who came with this Order which was to be ex∣ecuted in any Part of the West-Riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> took <HI>Tho. Aldam,</HI> and carried him to <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>G. Fox</HI> went with him twenty Miles; but tho' the Constable had a Warrant for him also, yet he meddled not with <HI>G. Fox,</HI> saying, <HI>He was loth to trouble Men that were Strangers; but Tho. Aldam was his Neighbour.</HI> About this Time <HI>Richard Farnsworth</HI> went into an eminent Steeple-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wakefield</NOTE> in, or about <HI>Wakefield;</HI> where he spoke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o powerfully, that the People were amazed. The Priest of that Place whose Name was <HI>Marshal,</HI> spread a slanderous Report, <HI>That</HI> G. Fox <HI>carried Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>les about with him, and made People drink thereof, which
<PB N="51" REF="003104_0062_0FEFF38B0F8F0C28"/>
made them follow him.</HI> And <HI>that he rid upon a great black Horse, and was seen in one Country upon that Horse, and in the same Hour in an other Country threescore Miles off.</HI> But these horrid Lies were so far from turn∣ing to the Priest's Advantage, that he preached many of his Hearers away from him; for it was well known, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had no Horse at that Time, but travelled on Foot. He coming now into a Steeple-house not far from <HI>Bradford,</HI> the Priest took his Text from <HI>Jer.</HI> V. 31. <HI>My People love to have it so;</HI> leaving out the foregoing Words, <HI>The Prophets prophesy falsely, and the Priests bear Rule by their Means. G. Fox</HI> unwilling to let this pass unregarded, shewed the People the Priest's unfair Deal∣ing, and directing them to Christ, the true inward Teacher, declared, That <HI>God was come to teach his People himself, and to bring them off from all the World's Teachers and Hirelings, that they might come to receive freely from him;</HI> concluding his Speech with a Warning of the Day of the Lord that was coming upon all Flesh. He passed from thence without much Opposition, and travelled now for some Time with <HI>Richard Farnsworth,</HI> with whom he once passed a Night in the open Field, on a Bed they made of Fern.</P>
<P>Then parting from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wentzer∣dale.</NOTE> he came to <HI>Wentzerdale,</HI> where he went into the Steeple-house; and after the Lecture, he spoke to the People much in the same Terms as he used to do on the like Occasions; and had not much Opposition there. Thus he went from Place to Place, and often met with strange Occurrences, some of which were more jocose than serious; others very rude, and even dangerous to his Life. But he trusted in God, really believing that he had sent him to preach Re∣pentance, and to exhort People to a true Conversion.</P>
<P>Thus travelling on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedburgh. <HI>Just.</HI> Benson.</NOTE> he came near <HI>Sedburgh;</HI> there he went to a Meet∣ing at Justice <HI>Benson</HI>'s, where a People met that were separated from the publick Worship; and by his Preaching, he gave such general Satisfac∣tion, that most of the Hearers were convinc'd of the Truth declared by him. Thus the Number of his Fellow-Believers increased so, that now they had Meetings by themselves, in many Places of the Country. About this Time there being a Fair at <HI>Sedburgh, G. Fox</HI> declared the Day of the Lord thro the Fair; and afterwards went into the Steeple-house-Yard, where Abundance of People came to him: Here he preached for several Hours, shewing, <Q>That the Lord was come to teach his People himself, and to bring them off from all the World's Ways, and Teachers, to Christ, the true Teacher, and the true Way to God. Moreover, he shewed the declining State of the modern Doctors and Teachers; and exhorted the People to come off from the Temples made with Hands, and wait to receive the Spirit of the Lord, that they might know themselves to be the Temples of God.</Q> None of the Priests, several of whom were there, spoke against what he had declared; but a Cap∣tain said, <HI>Why will you not go into the Church; for this is not a fit Place to preach in? G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>That he did not approve of their Church.</HI> Then stood up one <HI>Francis Howgil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">F. Howgil.</NOTE> who was a Preacher, and tho' he never had seen <HI>G. Fox</HI> before, yet he was so affected with him, that he answered the Captain, and soon put him to silence: For, said, <HI>Howgil, This Man speaks with Authority, and not as the Scribes.</HI> After this <HI>G. Fox</HI> opened to the People, <Q>That that Ground and House was not more holy than another Place; and that the House was not the Church, but the People, whom Christ was the Head of.</Q> Then the Priests coming to him, he warned them to repent; upon which one of them said, <HI>He was mad:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Capt.</HI> Ward. Firbank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chappel <HI>in</HI> Westmor∣land.</NOTE> But notwithstanding, his saying so, many were convinced there that Day; and amongst these, one Captain <HI>Ward.</HI> The next First Day <HI>G. Fox</HI> came to <HI>Firbank</HI> Chappel in <HI>Westmorland,</HI> where the foresaid <HI>Francis
<PB N="52" REF="003104_0063_0FEFF38D00462120"/>
Howgil,</HI> and one <HI>John Audland</HI> had been preaching in the Morning. The Chappel at that Time was so full of People, that many could not get in:<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Audland.</NOTE> And <HI>Howgil</HI> said afterwards, <HI>He thought</HI> G. Fox <HI>look'd into the Chappel, and his Spirit was ready to fail.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> did not look into it; however, <HI>Howgil</HI> had been so reach'd when he heard him preach in the Steeple-house-Yard at <HI>Sedburgh,</HI> that he was, as it were, check'd, and so quickly made an End of his Sermon; thinking as well as others, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> would preach there that Day, as indeed he did: For having re∣freshed himself at Noon with a little Water out of a Brook, he went and sate down on the Top of a Rock hard by the Chappel, intending to have a Meeting there. At this People wondered, because they look'd upon the Church (so called) as an holy Place, requisite for Worship. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them afterwards, <HI>That the Ground whereon he stood, was as good as that of the Steeple-house;</HI> besides, we find, that Christ himself did preach on a Mountain, and also at the Sea-Side. Now in the Afternoon the People gathered about him, with several of their Preach∣ers, and amongst these, <HI>F. Howgil,</HI> and <HI>J. Audland.</HI> To this Auditory, which was judged to consist of more than a thousand People, <HI>G. Fox</HI> began to preach, and spoke about the Space of three Hours, directing all <Q>To the Spirit of God in themselves, that so they might be turned from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan, which they had been under, unto God; by which they should become Children of the Light, and, by the Spirit of Truth, be led into all Truth, and so sensibly understand the Words of the Prophets, of Christ, and of the Apostles; and come to know Christ to be their Teacher to instruct them; their Counsellor to direct them, their Shepherd to feed them, their Bishop to oversee them, and their Prophet to open divine Mysteries to them; that so their Bodies might be pre∣pared, sanctify'd, and made fit Temples for God and Christ to dwell in. Moreover, he explained the Prophets, and the Figures, and Shadows, and directed his Hearers to Christ the Substance. He al∣so opened the Parables and Sayings of Christ, and shewed the Intent and Scope of the Apostles Writings, and Epistles to the Elect. Then he spoke also concerning the State of the Apostacy, that hath been since the Apostles Days; how the Priests had gotten the Scripture, without being in that Spirit which gave them forth; and how they were found in the Steps of the false Prophets, Scribes, and Pharisees of old, and were such as the true Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles cried against; insomuch, that none that were guided by the Spirit of God now, could own them.</Q> Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was thus preaching, many old People went into the Chappel, and looked out at the Windows, thinking it a strange Thing to see a Man preach on a Hill, and not in the Church (as they called it.) He perceiving this, said, <Q>That the Steeple-house, and the Ground whereon it stood, was no more holy than that Hill; and that those Temples, which they called the dreadful Houses of God, were not set up by the Command of God and Christ: nor their Priests instituted, as <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Priesthood was; nor their Tythes appointed by God, as those amongst the <HI>Jews</HI> were. But that Christ was come, who ended both the Temple, and its Worship, and the Priests and their Tythes; and that therefore all ought to hearken unto him; for he said, <HI>Learn of me;</HI> and God said of him, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</HI> In Conclusion, he said, That the Lord God had sent him to preach the Everlasting Gospel, and Word of Life amongst them; and to bring them off from all these Temples, Tythes, Priests, and Rudi∣ments of the World, which were gotten up since the Apostles Days,
<PB N="53" REF="003104_0064_0FEFF3900A8BB500"/>
and had been set up by such as had erred from the Spirit and Power the Apostles were in.</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> sent to preach the Gospel, and bring off from outward Tem∣ples, Tythes, Priests, Ru∣diments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The powerful Effect of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sermon.</NOTE> Thus preached <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and his Ministry was at that Time accompanied with such a convincing Power, and so reach∣ed the Hearts of the People, that many, and even all the Teachers of that Congregation, who were many, were convinced of that Truth which was declared to them.</P>
<P>After this Meeting was over, <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>John Audland</HI>'s, who, as well as <HI>Francis Howgil,</HI> and others, had been quite brought over by his effectual Preaching. And as these had been zealous Preachers amongst those of their former Persuasion, so it was not long before they became Publishers of that Doctrine, which now, by the Ministry of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> they had embraced;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In particular on <HI>J. Aud∣land,</HI> and <HI>F. Howgil.</HI></NOTE> and were so far from approving their former Ser∣vice, that they gave back the Money they received for their Preaching to the Parish of <HI>Colton</HI> in <HI>Lancashire;</HI> being now resolved to give free∣ly what they had received freely.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They became Publishers of the same Doc∣trine.</NOTE> And here I shall make some small Digression, in saying something concerning these two excellent Men.</P>
<P><HI>John Audland</HI> was a young Man, of a comely Countenance, and very lovely Qualities.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colton</HI> in <HI>Lancashire.</HI> Character of <HI>J. Audland.</HI></NOTE> When he was but seventeen or eighteen Years old, he was very religious, and a zealous Searcher of the Holy Scriptures and having a good Understanding, and strong Memory, he thereby gathered a large Treasure of Scripture-Learning, became an eminent Teacher a∣mongst the <HI>Independents,</HI> and had a very numerous Auditory. But when he heard <HI>G. Fox</HI> preach, he was thereby so reached to the Heart, that he began in Process of Time to see the Emptiness of his great Literal Knowledge, and that all his Righteousness was but as filthy Raggs. This brought him to a State of Mourning; for now he saw that all his Profession and Wisdom could not bring him to true Happiness. But the Lord, who doth <HI>not break the bruised Reed, nor quench the smoaking Flax,</HI> did pity him in this State of deep Humiliation, and bore him up again by his supporting Power; whereby in Time he came to be pre∣pared to that Service he was appointed to by God.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Francis Howgil;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And of <HI>F. Howgil.</HI></NOTE> he was also a religious Man, who having seen the Superstitions of the Episcopal Church, had left it, and applied himself to the <HI>Independents.</HI> But altho' he, who had been trained up in the University to be a Minister, became a Teacher amongst the <HI>Inde∣pendents,</HI> and was zealous in Vertue; yet he remained dissatisfy'd in him∣self, finding, that notwithstanding all his Fasting, Praying, and good Works, the Root of Sin still remained in him: And altho' the common Doctrine was, that Christ had taken the Guilt of Sin upon himself, yet this could not satisfy him; because his Conscience told him, <HI>His Servant thou art, whom thou obeyest.</HI> Thus encreasing in Understanding, it was re∣vealed to him, that the Lord, according to what the Prophets had fore∣told, would teach his People himself; and it seemed also to him, that this Time was near at Hand. Some while after it happened, as hath been said already, that he was present when <HI>G. Fox</HI> preach'd, and when he heard him say, That <HI>the Light of Christ in Man was the Way to Christ,</HI> he believed this to be the Word of Truth; and he saw how he had been ignorant of the Principle of true Religion. Submitting then to the Reproofs of this inward Light, he saw the Unfruitfulness of all his La∣bour; and Anguish and Sorrow seized on him; and Judgment went over all his former Actions: But he being given up, and resign'd in that State, saying with himself, <HI>Thou, O God, art just in all thy Judgments,</HI> it pleased the Lord in due Time to fill his Heart with Joy, and to make him a Minister of his Everlasting Word. But no sooner did he enter into that Service, but both Priests and Magistrates, of whom he for∣merly had been beloved, became his Enemies; and Envy was so kind∣led
<PB N="54" REF="003104_0065_0FEFF391A9D486D0"/>
against him, that he was lock'd up in a nasty Place, at <HI>Appleby</HI> in <HI>Westmorland,</HI> and was kept there Prisoner for some Time.</P>
<P>But let me now return to <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Appleby <HI>in</HI> Westmorland Kendal.</NOTE> who coming to <HI>Kendal,</HI> had a Meet∣ing there in the Town-Hall, where declaring the Word of Life, he shewed the People, <Q>How they might come to the saving Knowledge of Christ, and to have a right Understanding of the Holy Scripture; opening to them what it was that would lead them into the Way of Reconciliation with God.</Q> This was of such Effect, that seve∣ral became convinced of the Truth published by him; and others were so well affected to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Under-Bar∣row.</NOTE> that when he went to <HI>Ʋnder-Barrow,</HI> several Peo∣ple accompanied him, and he had great Reasonings with them, but especially with one <HI>Edward Burrough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Burrough.</NOTE> who, tho' of extraordinary Parts, and acquired Knowledge, was not able to withstand the efficacious Say∣ings of <HI>G. Fox.</HI> And because this <HI>Burrough</HI> became an eminent Man among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, being endued with Courage and Under∣standing, fit to overcome his Opposers, and to break even stony Hearts, I'll mention here a little of his Descent and Quality.</P>
<P>He was born in the Barony of <HI>Kendal</HI> in <HI>Westmorland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Chara∣cter.</NOTE> of Parents, who for their honest and vertuous Life, were in good Repute; he was well educated, and train'd up in such Learning as that Country did afford. His Knowledge and Understanding soon passed his Years; for being but a Boy, he had the Spirit of a Man, and in his Youth was endued with Wisdom above his Equals in Years: Moreover, he was very religious, conversing frequently with those that were in Esteem for their Piety and godly Life. Neither was he inclined to the ordinary Pleasures of Youth; but it was his Delight to be exercised in reading of the Holy Scripture, wherein he was well versed. By his Parents he was trained up in the Episcopal Worship; yet when but twelve Years of Age, he often went to the Meeting of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> because their Doctrine in many Things seemed to him to approach nearer to Truth, than that of the publick Church; wherefore he became a Follower of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> altho' he was reviled for it by his Acquaintance. But being come to the Age of about seventeen Years, and growing more and more sensible of his own Condition, he was often struck with Terror, and when he had been praying, he heard, as it were, a Voice, <HI>Thou art ignorant of God; thou knowest not where he is, nor what he is: To what Purpose is thy Prayer?</HI> This brought him under such a Concern, that he began to take diligent Heed to his Life, so that he abstained not on∣ly from all Vanities, but when Occasion offer'd, he reproved others for their vain Conversation and Wickedness; but because of this, he was derided, and looked upon scornfully by many; yet continued to live religiously, and felt sometimes sweet Refreshments to his Soul. But tho' he had the Truth in his Comprehension, yet he wanted the real and experimental Knowledge of it, and so became darkned again, lo∣sing what he once possessed: And being too ready to flatter himself, would say, <HI>Whom God loves once, he loves for ever.</HI> Now he grew weary of hearing any of the Priests, for he saw they did not possess what they spoke of to others; and sometimes he began to question his own Experiences. Being thus many Times put to a Stand, he seem'd al∣most to be at a Loss. In this Condition he heard <HI>G. Fox</HI> preach, and afterwards reasoned with him; and it pleased the Lord so to open his Understanding, that he perceived (as he relates himself) that he was in the prodigal State, above the Cross of Christ, and not in the pure Fear of the Lord. Being thus convinced, he entred into the Society of the despised <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' he was now rejected by his Relations, and by a blind Zeal, turn'd out of his Father's House. This he bore
<PB N="55" REF="003104_0066_0FEFF394147E79A8"/>
patiently, and continued faithful in the Doctrine he had embraced. And in Process of Time he so advanced in true Knowledge, that he became a very eminent Minister of the Gospel. But what Adversities did he not undergo! Reviling, Slandering, Buffeting, and Caning was often his Lot; Watching and Fasting were many Times his Portion; and Im∣prisonment, great Jeopardies, and Danger of Life, he was not unac∣quainted with. But nothing could make this Hero shrink: He always was laborious, and seldom had any Hours of Rest. In his Preaching he was very acceptable, and eloquent in his Speech, and had the Tongue (according to what an eminent Author relates, that knew him from his Youth) of a learned Orator, to declare himself to the Understandings and Consciences of all Men he met with. He was also a great Writer, and often would engage in Disputes with those of other Perswasions, sparing no Pains where he thought he could serve the Lord, and the Church. Thus much for this Time of <HI>E. Burrough.</HI></P>
<P>Let's return now to <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Under-Bar∣row.</NOTE> whom we left at <HI>Ʋnder-Barrow,</HI> where, with the Consent of the Inhabitants, he had a great Meeting in the Chappel, and many were convinced, and received the Truth preached by him. From thence he went to <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and having in some Places spoken in the Steeple-houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ulverstone. Swarthmore. <HI>Judge</HI> Fell.</NOTE> he came to <HI>Ʋlverstone,</HI> and so to <HI>Swarth∣more,</HI> to the House of <HI>Thomas Fell,</HI> a Judge in <HI>Wales,</HI> where many Priests frequently came. The Judge was at that Time abroad, employ'd in the Exercise of his Office; and his Wife <HI>Margaret</HI> was also gone abroad that Day. <HI>G. Fox</HI> in the mean while coming thither, met the Priest <HI>William Lampitt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Lampitt.</NOTE> who was a high Notionist, and rich in Words. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> soon perceiving that he was without the Possession of what he professed, opposed him boldly. Before it was Night <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> re∣turned home, and her Children told her, That <HI>Lampitt</HI> and <HI>Fox</HI> had dis∣agreed, which did somewhat trouble her, for the making much of the Priests, especially admired <HI>Lampitt.</HI> That same Night <HI>G. Fox</HI> had much Reasoning there, and declared the Truth to her and her Family. The next Day <HI>Lampitt</HI> came again, and <HI>G. Fox</HI> discoursed with him in the Pre∣sence of <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> who then began clearly to discern the Priest. The following Day being appointed for an Humiliation, <HI>Margaret</HI> went with her Children to the Steeple-house at <HI>Ʋlverstone,</HI> having asked <HI>G. Fox</HI> before to go with her: But he replying, That <HI>he must do as he was ordered by the Lord,</HI> left her, and walked into the Fields; and there he felt a strong Motion to go also to the Steeple-house. When he came there the People were singing, but what they sung was, according to his Opini∣on, altogether unsuitable to their States. After they had done, he stept up on a Form, and asked Leave to speak: The Priest consenting, <HI>G. Fox</HI> began thus: <HI>He is not a</HI> Jew <HI>that is one outwardly; neither is that Circumcisi∣on which is outward: But he is a</HI> Jew <HI>that is one inwardly; and that is Circum∣cision which is of the Heart.</HI> And so he went on, and said, <Q>That Christ was the Light of the World, and enlighteneth every Man that com∣eth into the World, and that by this Light they might be gathered to God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> standing up in her P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, wondered at this Doctrine, having never heard any such before. In the mean while <HI>G. Fox</HI> went on, and opening the Scriptures said, <Q>That they were the Prophet's Words, and Christ's, and the Apostle's Words; and that what they spoke, they enjoyed and possessed, and had it from the Lord.</Q> <HI>What have any to do,</HI> said he, <HI>with the Scriptures, if they come not to the Spirit that gave them forth? You will say,</HI> Christ <HI>saith this, and the Apostles say this; but what canst thou, O Man, say thy self concerning this? Art thou a Child of the Light? Dost thou walk in the Light? And what thou speakest, is it inwardly from God?</HI> He shewed also, <Q>That God was come
<PB N="56" REF="003104_0067_0FEFF39795674750"/>
to teach his People himself, by his Spirit, and to bring them off from their Churches, and Religions, and their Ways of Worship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> These his Words did so effectually reach the aforesaid <HI>Margaret,</HI> that she sate down in her Pew again, and weeping bitterly, cried in her Spirit to the Lord, <HI>We are all Thieves! We are all Thieves! We have taken the Scriptures in Words, and know nothing of them in our selves. G. Fox</HI> still going on, declared against the false Prophets, and said, <Q>That their Way of Worship was but talking of other Mens Words, and that they themselves were out of the Life and Spirit, which those were in who gave them forth.</Q> Then cried out a Justice of Peace, call'd <HI>John Sawrey, Take him away:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Sawrey.</NOTE> But <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> said to the Officers: <HI>Let him alone: Why may not he speak as well as any other?</HI> The Priest <HI>Lampitt,</HI> (it's like to please her) said also, <HI>Let him speak. G. Fox</HI> then speaking yet a while, was at length led out by the Constable, according to the Order of the said Justice <HI>Sawrey;</HI> and then he spoke to the People in the Grave-Yard. In the Evening he came again into the House of Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> where he took Occasion to speak to the Servants, and those of the Family, who most of them came so effectually to be convinced by him, that they embraced the Truth which he preached. Among these was also <HI>William Caton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Caton.</NOTE> of whom more hereafter. <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> in the mean while being come home, was so reached, that she scarce kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w what to do, her Husband being from home; for she clearly perceived what she had heard <HI>G. Fox</HI> preach, was Truth. The First Day after he went to <HI>Aldenham</HI>-Steeple-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aldenham.</NOTE> where, when the Priest had done, he spoke to the People, and admonished them to return to the Lord. From thence he went to <HI>Ram-side,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ram-side.</NOTE> where was a Chappel, in which one <HI>Thomas Lawson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Lawson.</NOTE> who was an eminent Priest, used to preach; who having some Notice of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s coming, preach'd in the Morning, and told his Peo∣ple that <HI>G. Fox</HI> was to come there in the Afternoon; by which Means very many People were gathered together. When he came, he saw there was no Place so convenient to speak to the People, as the Chap∣pel, and therefore he went into it. The Priest <HI>Lawson</HI> willing to give a full Opportunity to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> went not up into the Pulpit, but left all the Time to him. And <HI>G. Fox</HI> so powerfully declared the Doc∣trine of Truth, that many receiv'd it, and among those the Priest him∣self, who left off his preaching for Hire, and in Process of Time came to preach the Lord Jesus Christ, and his glorious Gospel freely; which however did not hinder him to exercise himself in the Knowledge of Herbs, wherein he came to be so experienc'd, that he was, as I have been told, one of the most skilful Herbalists in <HI>England;</HI> which gave Occasion to an eminent Botanist, who at first seem'd a little shy of him, when he perceiv'd his great Skill, to love him as a singular Friend. But this transiently.</P>
<P>Now I return again to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who having perform'd his Service about <HI>Ram-side,</HI> went somewhere else, and came also to <HI>Becliff,</HI> where he found some People that told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beclif.</NOTE> <HI>They could not dispute▪</HI> But he bid them <Q>to fear the Lord, and not to speak the Words of God in an airy Manner, but do the Things required. Moreover, that they ought to mind the Light of Christ, and take heed to his Spirit in their Hearts, whereby they would come to see their evil Thoughts, Words, and Actions; for this Light (he said) would shew them their Sins, and by following this Light, they should also see that their Saviour Christ Jesus saved them from Sin: And, he said, the first Step to Peace was to stand still in the Light, which shewed them their Sins and Transgressions; by which they should see they were in the Fall of the old <HI>Adam,</HI> in Darkness and Death, alienated from
<PB N="57" REF="003104_0068_0FEFF39A57C1E8C0"/>
the Covenant of the Promise, and without God in the World; and that Christ who died for them, was their Saviour and Redeemer, and their Way to God.</Q> After <HI>G. Fox</HI> had spoken thus, he went to a new built Chappel near <HI>Gleaston,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gleaston.</NOTE> wherein none had yet preached. Hither came a great many People, unto whom he preached, and many were convinced. From thence he returned to <HI>Swarthmore</HI> again: For <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> being full of Fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marg. Fell.</NOTE> and expecting her Husband's Return home, had desired <HI>G. Fox</HI> to come; since some of the great Ones of the Country being gone to meet her Husband, had inform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him, <HI>That a great Disaster had befallen his Family; and that the</HI> Quakers <HI>were Witches, and had turned them from their Religion; and that he must send them away, or all the Country would be undone.</HI> Without all Question this was a very sad Message to Judge <HI>Fell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Judge <HI>Fell.</HI></NOTE> for he came home greatly offended: And one may easily think what a Condition his Wife was in, being in Fear, that she should either displease her Husband, or offend God. At that Time <HI>Richard Farnsworth</HI> and <HI>James Naylor</HI> were at her House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Farns∣worth, <HI>and</HI> James Nay∣lor.</NOTE> and she desired them to speak to her Husband; which they did very moderately and wisely. And tho' at first he was displeased, yet after he had heard them speak, he was better satisfied. And they making as if they would go away, she desired them to stay, because she expected <HI>G. Fox</HI> that Evening; and she wished for an Opportunity, that both he and they might speak to her Husband, whereby he might satisfy himself farther about them. Dinner in the mean Time being ready, Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> and his Wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> sat down at Table, and whilst they were sitting, an extraordinary Power seizing on her, made such an Operation on her Mind, that he was struck with Amazement, and knew not what to think of it; but he was quiet and still; and the Children also were become so grave and modest, that they could not play on their Musick they were learning. At Night <HI>G. Fox</HI> came, and Judge <HI>Fell</HI> sitting in the Parlour, <HI>Margaret</HI> asked him, <HI>If</HI> G. Fox <HI>might come in;</HI> and he said, <HI>Yes. George</HI> then coming in without any Compliment, began to speak pre∣sently; at which the Family, as well as <HI>J. Naylor</HI> and <HI>R. Farnsworth</HI> en∣tered. He now speaking, <Q>declared what the Practice of Christ and the Apostles was in their Day; and shewed how the Apostacy came in since; and what was the Practice of the modern Priests in the Apo∣stacy.</Q> He also answer'd all the Objections of Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> and so thoroughly satisfy'd him by the Scriptures, that he was convinced in his Judgment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Justice</HI> Ro∣binson.</NOTE> and asked, <HI>If he was that</HI> George Fox <HI>whom Justice</HI> Robin∣son <HI>had spoken so much in Commendation of amongst many of the Parliament Men?</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> answered him, <HI>That he had been with the Justices</HI> Robinson <HI>and</HI> Hotham <HI>in</HI> Yorkshire; <HI>that they had been very civil and loving to him, and that they were convinced in their Judgments by the Spirit of God, that the Principle he bore Testimony to, was the Truth; and that they saw be∣yond the Priests of the Nation.</HI> All this so satisfied Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> that he was very quiet that Night, and went to Bed. The next Morning came <HI>Lampitt,</HI> the Priest of <HI>Ʋlverstone,</HI> and walking with the Judge into the Garden, spoke much to him there, to render the Doctrine of the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> odious to him, having also said to others, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> held strange Notions. But Judge <HI>Fell</HI> had seen the Night before so much, that the Priest got little Entrance upon him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Priest</HI> Lam∣pitt.</NOTE> And when <HI>Lampitt</HI> came into the House again, <HI>G. Fox</HI> spoke sharply to him, and asked him, <HI>When God spake to him, and called him to preach to the People?</HI> The Priest not liking such Questions, it was not long before he went away. Now whilst some were speaking how several in those Parts were convinced of the Truth now declared, and that they knew not where to get a Meeting-Place; Judge <HI>Fell</HI> hearing them, said of his own Accord, <HI>You may meet in my
<PB N="58" REF="003104_0069_0FEFF39C88771D40"/>
Hall if you will.</HI> So the next First Day there was at his House a Meet∣ing, and a large one indeed, being the first Meeting of the People cal∣led <HI>Quakers,</HI> that was at <HI>Swarthmore;</HI> and so it continued to be kept there until the Year 1690, when a new Meeting-house was built there. Judge <HI>Fell</HI> not being willing to appear in that Meeting, went that Day to the Steeple-house, and none with him but his Clerk and his Groom. Yet in Process of Time he came to be so well affected to the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, that tho' he did not enter publickly into their Society, yet he loved them, and several Years before his Death, he did not frequent the Steeple-house any more.</P>
<P>After <HI>G. Fox</HI> had stayed some Days at the House of Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> he went to <HI>Lancaster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lancaster.</NOTE> and there preached in the Market; and on the next First Day, he had a great Meeting in the Street, amongst the Soldiers, to whom he declared the Truth; and in the Afternoon went to the Steeple-House: But speaking there, and directing People to the Spirit of God, he was haled out, and stoned along the Street. And after having travelled about some Time, and preached in some Places, some∣times with rude Opposition, he returned to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> where dis∣coursing with several Priests at Judge <HI>Fell</HI>'s House, he asked them, <HI>Whe∣ther any of them ever heard the Voice of God or Christ, commanding them to go to any People, and declare the Word of the Lord to them?</HI> But none of them answered this with <HI>Yea:</HI> Yet one saying, <HI>I can speak of my Experience as much as you; G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>Experience was one Thing, but to go with a Message, and to have the Word of the Lord, as the Prophets and Apostles had, was quite another.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Taylor.</NOTE> An ancient Priest, whose Name was <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> did ingenuously confess before Judge <HI>Fell, That he had never heard the Voice of God, nor of Christ,</HI> but that he spoke his Experiences, and the Experiences of the Saints in former Ages. This very much confirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Judge <HI>Fell</HI> in the Persuasion he had already, that the Priests were not what they pretended to be: For he had thought, as the Generality of the People did then, That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were sent from God. At this Time the Saying of <HI>G. Fox</HI> wrought so close on the Mind of the said <HI>T. Tay∣lor,</HI> that he was convinced, and travelled with him into <HI>Westmorland;</HI> and coming into <HI>Crosland</HI> Steeple-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crosland.</NOTE> <HI>T. Taylor</HI>'s Mouth was opened, so that he declared amongst the People, how he had been before he was convinced; and like the good <HI>Scribe,</HI> brought forth Things new and old from his Treasury, to the People; and shewed them how the Priests were out of the Way.</P>
<P>Now a great Rage arose among the Priests, and they began as much as they could, to stir up to Persecution; for not only <HI>T. Taylor</HI> after some Time preach'd the Gospel freely, but several others, viz. <HI>John Audland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Audland, F. Howgil, J. Cam, E. Burrough, R. Hubber∣thorn. M. Halhead. Lancashire. Ulverstone.</NOTE> <HI>Francis Howgil, John Cam, Edward Burrough, Richard Hubberthorn, Miles Halhead,</HI> and others, appeared zealous Preachers among those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and often declared the Doctrine they professed in Stee∣ple-houses, and Markets, whereby the Number of their Friends began greatly to increase.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>G. Fox</HI> returned into <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and went to <HI>Ʋl∣verstone,</HI> where <HI>Lampitt</HI> before mentioned, was Priest. He now seeing how the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> did set up Meetings, and met in private Houses, said, <HI>They forsook the Temple, and went to</HI> Jeroboam's <HI>Calves-Houses;</HI> whereas formerly he had preached of a People, <HI>that would own the Teachings of God;</HI> and that <HI>Men and Women should come to declare the Gospel.</HI> Now it was told him, <Q>That the Old Mass-Houses, which were called Churches, were more like <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s Calves-houses; tho' Men strove to persuade People that such a Building was the House of God: Whereas Christ was the Head of the Church, and never was
<PB N="59" REF="003104_0070_0FEFF39E3A52A230"/>
called the Head of an old House; and that the Apostle speaking of Christ, said, <HI>Whose House we are,</HI> Heb. iii. 6.</Q> This Passage puts me in Mind, how some of the Parliament Soldiers, observing, over some of the Steeple-house-Doors, these Words of the Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> when God had appeared to him in a Dream, <HI>This is none other but the House of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven,</HI> could not endure to see this gross Conceit concerning those Buildings, but rased out the Words, <HI>of God,</HI> and, <HI>of Heaven;</HI> so that nothing was left, but, <HI>This is none other but the House;</HI> and <HI>This is the Gate:</HI> And certainly their Zeal was more reaso∣nable than the Conceit of those who think that in the Gospel-Days a building of Lime and Stone may be called, <HI>The House of God.</HI> It seems also a silly Conceit to call a Meeting-house, furnished with a Steeple, <HI>a Church,</HI> and to deny that Name to the Congregation-houses of <HI>Dissen∣ters,</HI> calling them, and them only, <HI>Meeting-Houses.</HI> But this Notion hath kept up the Esteem of those Mass-houses; and the Priests, that they might not lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e their Gain of Burials, have endeavour'd to keep People in the Belief, that the Ground of these Buildings was holy: And this gave Occasion to the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to call those Buildings, <HI>Steeple-houses.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Occasion of the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd <HI>Steeple-houses.</HI></NOTE> Now since a fantastical Man I have very well known in <HI>Holland,</HI> conversing there among the People of that Persuasion, under∣took to translate that Denomination into <HI>Dutch, Gespitste huyzen,</HI> it gave Occasion to some <HI>Latin</HI> Writers in <HI>Germany,</HI> to complain, That the <HI>Quakers</HI> scornfully called their Temples, <HI>Domus acuminatas.</HI> And tho' <HI>Croese</HI> also in his <HI>Historia Quakeriana</HI> concerning them, <HI>Templa cuncti Quakeri con∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eliose vocabant aedes pyramidatas,</HI> yet he knew better. But this Di∣gression has led me off from <HI>G. Fox,</HI> whom I left at <HI>Ʋlverstone,</HI> where he went to the Steeple-house, whilst Priest <HI>Lampit</HI> was preaching. And when <HI>G. Fox</HI> began to speak,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Just.</HI> Sawrey.</NOTE> <HI>John Sawrey</HI> the Justice came to him, and said, <HI>If he would speak according to the Scriptures; he should speak. G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>He should speak according to the Scriptures, and bring the Scriptures to prove what he had to say.</HI> But then <HI>Sawrey;</HI> contradicting himself, said, <HI>he should not speak,</HI> and incensing the People against him, they fell up∣on <HI>G. Fox,</HI> knock'd him down, kick'd him, and trampled upon him. At last <HI>Sawrey</HI> came, took him from the People, and led him out of the Steeple-house, bidding the Constables to whip him. Then he was dragg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out of the Town, and given up to the Rage of the rude Mul∣titude, who did so terribly beat him with Switches and Staves, that at length fainting, he fell down upon the wet Common; but recovering again, and being strengthned by an immediate Power, he stood up again, and stretching out his Arms, he said with a loud Voice, <HI>Strike again, here are my Arms, my Head, and my Cheeks.</HI> Then a Mason gave him such a heavy Blow over the Back of his Hand with his Rule, that it was much bruised, and his Arm so benumbed, that he could not draw it to him again, so that some of the People cried out, <HI>He has spoiled his Hand for ever.</HI> But he being preserved thro' the Love of God, stood still, and after a while, he felt such an extraordinary strengthning Pow∣er, that he instantly recover'd Strength in his Hand and Arm. This made the People fall out among themselves; and some said, <HI>If he would give them Money, they would secure him from the rest.</HI> But he, instead of doing so, shewed them their false Christianity, and told them, they were more like Jews and Heathens, than true Christians; and that their Fruits were an Evidence of the unprofitable Ministry of their Priests. Then he felt himself moved to return to <HI>Ʋlverstone,</HI> and went into the Market there▪ And as he went, a Soldier meeting him, said <HI>Sir, I see you are a Man, and I am ashamed and grieved that you should be thus abused.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>The Lord's Power was over all.</HI> And this he expe∣rienced
<PB N="60" REF="003104_0071_0FEFF3A31D7974B8"/>
also, when he walked thro' the People in the Market; for none of them had Power to touch him then, tho some of his Friends were abused. And he seeing the Soldier among them, with his naked Rapier, bid him, <HI>put up his Sword again if he would go along with him;</HI> for he was willing to draw him out of the Company, lest some Mischief should be done: And yet a few Days after, seven Men fell upon this Soldier, and beat him cruelly, because he had taken Part with <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and his Friends.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> now having perform'd his Service at <HI>Ʋlverstone,</HI> came again to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Swarthmore.</NOTE> where he found several of his Friends dressing their Wounds and Bruises receiv'd by the Hearers of Priest <HI>Lampitt.</HI> And now the Priests began to prophesy again, <HI>That within half a Year the</HI> Quakers <HI>should all be put down and gone.</HI> But they reckoned wrong; for it fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with those People, as with Trees, which grow best when most lopped. <HI>Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus, per damna, per cades, ab ipso ducit opes ani∣mumque ferro.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> keeping in continual Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Naylor. Walney-I∣sland.

Fox</HI> then zealously speaking to him, he was so struck, that he trembled with Fear, and went away. The next Morning <HI>G. Fox</HI> went over in a Boat to <HI>James Lancaster</HI>'s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Lancaster.</NOTE> and as soon as he came to Land, about forty Men with Staves, Clubs, and Fishing-Poles, fell upon him, beating and punching him, and endeavoured to thrust him backward into the Sea: But he pressing on, was knock'd down, and stunn'd. When he came to himself again, he saw <HI>James Lancaster</HI>'s Wife throwing Stones at his Face, and her Husband <HI>James</HI> was lying over him, to keep the Blows and the Stones from off him: For the People had persuaded this Woman, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had bewitch'd her Husband, and promis'd her to kill him when he came thither. But the Lord, by his invisible Power preserved him wonderfully, so that they could not take away his Life. At length he got up, but was soon beat down again into the Boat; which <HI>James Lancaster</HI> observing, came to him, and set him over the Water. Being come to the other Side, they saw how the wicked Crew was fallen upon <HI>James Naylor,</HI> with an horrible Cry, <HI>Kill him, kill him:</HI> For whilst they had been beat∣ing of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> they had not minded <HI>Naylor,</HI> who was walking up into a Field.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> being now come again to <HI>Cockan,</HI> met with no better Enter∣tainment, for the People came on with Pitchforks, Flails, and Staves, to keep him out of the Town, crying, <HI>Kill him, Knock him on the Head.</HI> But he was preserved alive; and after having been much abused, they drove him a pretty Way out of the Town, and left him. Then <HI>James Lancaster</HI> went back to look after <HI>James Naylor.</HI> In the mean while <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to a Ditch of Water, and washed himself from the Blood and Dirt: After which he walked about three Miles to the House of one <HI>Thomas Hutton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

When he was come to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> the Justices <HI>Sawrey</HI> and <HI>Thompson,</HI> gave forth a Warrant a∣gainst him; but Judge <HI>Fell</HI> coming home, made it ineffectual, and sent
<PB N="61" REF="003104_0072_0FEFF3A571BE8328"/>
out Warrants into the <HI>Isle of Walney,</HI> to apprehend all those riotous Per∣sons: Whereupon some of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Country. But what is re∣markable, <HI>James Lancaster</HI>'s Wife, who so wickedly behaved her self, repented so of her Evil, that she became afterwards one of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Friends.</P>
<P>Judge <HI>Fell</HI> now desired of <HI>G. Fox</HI> a Relation of what had befaln him: But he was backward, and said, <HI>That those People could not do otherwise in the Spirit they were; and that they manifested the Fruits of their Priests Ministry.</HI> Which made the Judge afterward say to his Wife: G. Fox <HI>spoke of the Thing as a Man that had not been concerned.</HI></P>
<P>The Occasion upon which a Warrant was issued out against him, was, a Design the Priests had laid to touch his Life; in Order to which, a Report was spread, that in a certain Meeting he had spoken Blasphemy; and they to maintain this Forgery, had suborned false Witnesses. The Time of the Sessions at <HI>Lancaster</HI> being come, <HI>G. Fox</HI> went thither with Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> who on the Way told him, <HI>That such a Matter had never been brought before him, and that he did not know what to do in the Case.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, When <HI>Paul</HI> was brought before the Rulers, and the <HI>Jews</HI> <Q>and Priests accused him of many false Things, he stood still all that while, till they had done; and when they had done, <HI>Felix</HI> the Go∣vernour beckoned to him to speak for himself. <HI>And so,</HI> said <HI>G. Fox, thou may'st do by me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> at the Sessions, there appeared about forty Priests against him;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Priest</HI> Mar∣shal.</NOTE> and these had chosen one <HI>Marshal,</HI> Priest of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> to be their Speaker; and the Witnesses they had provided, were a young Priest, and two Priest's Sons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A young Priest &amp; two Priests Sons false Wit∣nesses against <HI>G.

It seems you did not hear those Words spoken your self, tho' you have given it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon your Oath.</HI> There were several Persons in the Court, who declared that they had heard one of the two Priests Sons say, <HI>If he had Power, he would make</HI> George <HI>deny his Profession; and that he would take away his Life.</HI> The young Priest, who also was a Wit∣ness, confessed, that <HI>he should not have meddled with the Thing, had not another Priest sent for him, and set him on Work.</HI> After all the Accusati∣ons had been heard, several Men of Reputation in the Country affirm∣ed in Court, <HI>That no such Words, as had been sworn against</HI> G. Fox, <HI>were spoken by him at the Meeting;</HI> for most of the serious Men on that Side of the Country, that were then at the Sessions, had been at that Meet∣ing, wherein the Witnesses swore he spoke the aforesaid blasphemous Words. Colonel <HI>West,</HI> being a Justice of Peace, and then upon the Bench, was so well pleased with these Evidences, that he (having long been weak in Body) said, <HI>He blessed the Lord that had healed him that Day,</HI> adding, <HI>that he never saw so many sober People, and good Faces together in all his Life.</HI> And then turning himself to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> said, George, <HI>If thou hast any Thing to say to the People, thou may'st freely declare it.</HI> Then he began to speak; but Priest <HI>Marshal,</HI> the Orator for the other Priests, went away presently. Now that which <HI>G. Fox</HI> declared was, <Q>That the Holy Scriptures were given forth by the Spirit of God; and that all People must first come to the Spirit of God in themselves, by which they might know God and Christ, of whom the Prophets and Apostles learnt, and also know the Holy Scriptures: For as the Spirit of God was in them that gave forth the Scripture; so the
<PB N="62" REF="003104_0073_0FEFF3A84D0CBA90"/>
same Spirit of God must also be in those that come to know and un∣derstand the Scriptures: By which Spirit they might have Fellow∣ship with the Father, and with the Son, and with one another: And that without that Spirit, they could know neither God, nor Christ, nor the Scriptures, nor have right Fellowship with one ano∣ther.</Q> No sooner had he spoken these Words, but about half a Dozen Priests burst out into Passion, and one of them, whose Name was <HI>Jackus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest <HI>Jackus</HI> greatly con∣fus'd.</NOTE> said, <HI>That the Spirit and the Letter were inseparable:</HI> Which made <HI>G. Fox</HI> answer, <HI>Then every one that hath the Letter, hath the Spirit; and they might buy the Spirit with the Letter of the Scripture:</HI> To which Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> and Colonel <HI>West</HI> added, <HI>That according to that Position, they might carry the Spirit in their Pockets, as they did the Scriptures.</HI> The Ju∣stices also bid <HI>Jackus</HI> prove what he had said. But he finding himself caught, would have denied it: And the other Priests endeavour'd to disguise his Words with a pretended Meaning. But the Justices would admit no other Meaning, than the plain Sense of the Words. And seeing the Witnesses did not agree,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> cleared in open Sessi∣ons.</NOTE> and perceiving that they were set on by the Envy of the Priests, they discharged him: And after Judge <HI>Fell</HI> had spoken to the Justices <HI>Sawrey</HI> and <HI>Thompson,</HI> concerning the Warrant they had given forth against <HI>G. Fox,</HI> shewing that this tended to encourage such Riots as those in the <HI>Isle of Walney,</HI> he and Colonel <HI>West</HI> granted a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> to stop the Execution of the said Warrant.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> being thus cleared in open Sessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Per∣sons of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> convinced.</NOTE> many People rejoiced, and were that Day convinced of the Truth declared by him in the Court; and among these, one Justice <HI>Benson,</HI> and the Mayor of <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Briggs.</NOTE> whose Name was <HI>Ripan;</HI> also one <HI>Thomas Briggs,</HI> who had been very averse to, and an Opposer of the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called; and this same <HI>Briggs</HI> became afterwards a faithful Minister of the Gospel amongst them, and remained so to the End of his Days.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> stay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d yet some Days at <HI>Lancaster.</HI> But to relate all that he and his Friends met with, is not my Intention; for to set down at large all such Occurrences, would be a Work requiring more Leisure and Strength than can be expected of me: And therefore I intend on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to describe what I find most remarkable; tho' many notable Things have happened, of which I could not fully be informed in every Cir∣cumstance, as Name, Place, Time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But it is probable that this may give Occasion in <HI>England</HI> to some other Author after me, to make such Discoveries, that Posterity will wonder at it. For such Abuses as <HI>G. Fox</HI> met with, was the Share also of many others of his Friends, especially the Preachers, who this Year were no less than twenty five in Number; and almost in every Place where they came, they met with Opposition, and became as it were the Prey of the rude Multitude. But neither the Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, Buffeting, nor Stoning of the mad Rabble, nor the Jails or Whippings that befel them from the Magi∣strates, were able to stop the Progress of the Doctrine they preach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the People in Marke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and Streets, and also in Steeple-houses: And many even of those that had been en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag'd like Wolves, became afterwards like Lambs, and suffered patiently from others, what for∣merly they themselves in a blind Zeal had committed.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, by a firm and lasting Patience, have surmoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the greatest Difficulties, and are at length become a nume∣rous People, many not valuing their own Lives, when they met with any Opportunity, for the Service of God. And tho' their Enemies, on this Account, have charged them with Stubbornness and Obstinacy, yet they meekly resigned to what befel them, well knowing that thus to be accused hath been always the Lot of those who suffered for the
<PB N="63" REF="003104_0074_0FF07D257053C3E0"/>
Testimony of Truth. Neither could they be charged with Resistance, or making head against their Persecutors; for one Man did sometimes lead a great many of them to Prison, who never forsook their Religious Assemblies, how hot soever Persecution was. That this was also the Practice of the Primitive Christians, appears by what <HI>Cyprian</HI> (who died a Martyr) wrote to <HI>Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> viz. <HI>Nemo nostrum, quando apprehenditur, reluctatur: ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so adversus in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> violentiam vestram, quamvis nimius &amp; copi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus sit noster populus, ulc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>citur.</HI> And therefor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Reader think, that these that I have described, have been the greatest Sufferings of this harmless People; for I believe them to have been an hundred Times more than my Pen will be able to mention. But I take up again the Thread of my Relation.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> being acquitted by the Court, as nath been said, it made the Priests fret to hear it cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d about, That <HI>the Priests had lost the Day, and that the</HI> Quakers <HI>had kept the Field.</HI> To revenge this, they got some en∣vious Justices to join with them, who at the following Assizes at <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Judge <HI>Wind∣ham's</HI> Contest with Colonel <HI>West</HI> about <HI>G.

Fox;</HI> which so prevailed up∣on him, that he commanded Colonel <HI>West,</HI> who was Clerk of the As∣sizes, to issue forth a Warrant for apprehending him. But the said Co∣lonel telling the Judge of his Innocency, spoke boldly in his Defence. The Judge offended at this, commanded him again, <HI>either to write a Warrant, or to go off from his Seat.</HI> Then the Colonel told him in plain Terms, <HI>That he would not do it, but that he would offer up all his Estate, and his Body also for</HI> G Fox. Thus the Judge was stopt; and <HI>G. Fox</HI> coming that Night to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> heard of a Warrant to be given out against him, and therefore judged it better to shew himself openly, than to make his Adversaries seek him. So he went to the Chambers of Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> and Colonel <HI>West;</HI> and as soon as he came in, they smiled, and the Colonel said, <HI>What! are you come into the Dragon's Mouth?</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> was always undaunted, and did not use to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>linc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h in Danger. So he stay'd some Days in Town, and walked up and down there, without being meddled with, or questioned by any. Yet his Friends in the mean while did not suffer the less; for all Villany or Insolence that could be thought of, was not judged by some to be too bad to vex them. It was about this Time that <HI>Richard Hubberthorn,</HI> and several others were haled out of a Meeting by some wicked Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Hubber∣thorn.</NOTE> and carried some Di∣stance off into the Fields, where they bound them, and left them so in the Winter-Season.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> being now come again to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> wrote several Letters to the Magistrates and Priests who had raised Persecution thereabouts. That to Justice <HI>John Sawrey</HI> was very sharp, and after this Manner:</P>

<P>Sharp indeed was this Letter; but <HI>G. Fox</HI> thought himself moved thereto by the Lord: And it is remarkable that this Justice <HI>Sawrey,</HI> who was the first Persecutor in those Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first; Per∣secutor in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Parts afterwards drowned. <HI>Westmorland</HI> Just. <HI>Benson.</HI></NOTE> afterwards was drowned, and so died not a natural Death. To the Priest <HI>William Lampitt</HI> he writ also, and another Letter to others, to reprove them for their Wickedness. Some Time after he went to <HI>Westmorland,</HI> where Mischief was intended against him; but it was prevented by Justice <HI>Benson,</HI> and some conside∣rable
<PB N="65" REF="003104_0076_0FEFF3AD523B5BC0"/>
Men besides. Coming to <HI>Grayrigg,</HI> he had a Meeting there; where a Priest came to oppose, but was confounded; and there being many People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grayrigg.</NOTE> some of the Milk-Pails that stood upon the Side of the House, tumbled down, by Reason of the Croud; from which the Priest afterwards raised a Slander, <HI>That the Devil frighted him, and took away one Side of the House.</HI> And tho' this was a known Falshood, yet it was given out as true in publick Print.</P>
<P>Another Time this Priest came to another Meeting and fell to jang∣ling, saying first, That <HI>the Scriptures were the Word of God.</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, That <HI>they were the Words of God, but not Christ, who is the Word:</HI> And when he urged the Priest for Proof of what he had said, the Priest being at a Loss, was not long before he went away. Some Time after he coming again to a Meeting, and hearing that <HI>G. Fox</HI> di∣rected the People to Christ Jesus, the Priest taking out his Bible, said, <HI>It was the Word of God.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>It was the Words of God; but not God, the Word.</HI> The Priest however persisted in what he had said; and offer'd to prove before all the People, <HI>the Scriptures to be the Word of God.</HI> But this Quarrel tending to vain Logomachies, or Contests about Words, ended in Confusion; and many of the Priests Followers came to see the Vanity of his Assertions.</P>
<P>The Year being now come to an End,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Trans∣actions.</NOTE> and a War kindled between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. then in Exile, ask'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be receiv'd in their Navy, as a Volunteer, without any Command: But this was courteously refused by the States General. <HI>Oliver Crom∣wel,</HI> in the mean while, strove for the supreme Authority in <HI>England,</HI> the more, because he perceived how some of the Parliament, jealous of his increasing Greatness, endeavoured to cross him in his Design. This made him labour to get the Parliament dissolved: But they not going on so quickly as he would have them, to put a Period to their Sitting, he resolved arbitrarily to make an End of them. And entering the House in the Month called <HI>April,</HI> 1653, after having rudely inveighed against them, by telling them, That they had made a bad Use of their Authority, and that without their Dissolution the Realm would not be safe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oliver</HI> dis∣solves the Par∣liament.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He at length cried out, <HI>You are no Parliament:</HI> And then order∣ing some Musketeers to enter, he made the Members depart the House, and ordered the Doors to be shut; putting thus an End to this Assem∣bly, that had been sitting nigh thirteen Years.</P>
<P>But what is remarkable, <HI>G. Fox</HI> not long before being come to <HI>Swarth∣more,</HI> and hearing Judge <HI>Fell</HI> and Justice <HI>Benson</HI> discourse together con∣cerning the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>told by <HI>G. Fox.</HI></NOTE> he told them, <HI>That before that Day two Weeks the Parliament should be broken up, and the Speaker pluck'd out of his Chair.</HI> And thus it really happened: For at the breaking up of the Parlia∣ment, the Speaker being unwilling to come out of his Chair, said, <HI>That he would not come down unless he were forced:</HI> Which made General <HI>Harrison</HI> say to him, <HI>Sir, I will lend you my Hand;</HI> and thereupon taking him by the Hand, the Speaker came down. This agreed with what <HI>G. Fox</HI> had predicted. And a Fortnight after, Justice <HI>Benson</HI> told Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> That <HI>now he saw</HI> George <HI>was a true Prophet;</HI> since <HI>Oliver</HI> had by that Time dissolved the Parliament.</P>
<P>Now in <HI>Cumberland</HI> great Threatnings were spread, <HI>That if ever</HI> G. Fox <HI>came there again, they would take away his Life.</HI> He hearing this, went thither;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swartmore. <HI>Just.</HI> Pearson <HI>convinced.</HI></NOTE> but no Body did him any Harm. Returning then to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> where Justice <HI>Anthony Pearson</HI> was at that Time, he so effetually declared Truth, that this Justice was convinc'd, and not long after enter'd into the Society of the despised <HI>Quakers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bootle <HI>in</HI> Cumberland.</NOTE> <HI>G. Fox</HI> then going again into <HI>Cum∣berland,</HI> went to <HI>Bootle,</HI> and there found preaching in the Steeple-house,
<PB N="66" REF="003104_0077_0FEFF3B0A5AF2010"/>
a Priest from <HI>London,</HI> who gathered up all the Scriptures he could think of, that spake of <HI>False Prophets, Anti-Christs,</HI> and <HI>Deceivers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1663</NOTE> and made Application of them to the <HI>Quakers.</HI> But when he had done, <HI>George</HI> began to speak, and return'd all those Scripture Places on the Priest; who being displeas'd at this, said, <HI>That he must not speak there.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, That <HI>the Hour-glass being run, and he having done, the Time was free for him as well as for the Priest, who was himself but a Stranger there.</HI> He having said this, went on, and shewed who were the False Prophets, and what Marks the Scriptures gave of them; directing People to Christ their Teacher. When he had done, the Priest of the Place made a Speech to the People in the Steeple-house Yard, and said, <HI>This Man hath gotten all the honest Men and Women in</HI> Lancashire <HI>to him; and now he comes here to do the same.</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> returned, <HI>What wilt thou have left? And what have the Priests left them, but such as themselves? For if it be the Honest that receive the Truth, and are turned to Christ; then it must be the Dishonest that follow thee, and such as thou art.</HI> Some Words were also exchanged about Tythes; and <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them, <HI>That Christ had ended the Tything-Priestood, and had sent forth his Mini∣sters to give freely, as they had received freely.</HI></P>
<P>From thence he went to <HI>Cockermouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cocker∣mouth. J. Lancaster <HI>speaking un∣der a Tree.</HI></NOTE> near which Place he had ap∣pointed a Meeting; and coming thither, he found <HI>James Lancaster</HI> speaking under a Tree, which was so full of People, that it was in Dan∣ger of breaking. <HI>G. Fox</HI> now look'd about for a Place to stand upon, for the People lay spread up and down. But at length a Person came to him, and ask'd, <HI>If he would not go into the Church?</HI> He seeing no Place more convenient to speak to the People, told him, <HI>Yes.</HI> Whereupon the People rushed in on a sudden; so that he coming, (the House was so full of People) had much ado to get in. When they were settled, he stood up on a Seat, and preached about three Hours; and several Hundreds were that Day convinced of the Truth of his Doctrine.</P>
<P>From thence he went to other Places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brigham.</NOTE> and particularly to <HI>Brigham,</HI> where he preached in the Steeple-house with no less Success. After∣wards coming into a certain Place, and casting his Eye upon a Woman unknown to him, he told her that she had lived a lewd Life: To which she answer'd, <HI>That many could tell her of her outward Sins, but of her in∣ward, none could.</HI> Then he told her, <HI>Her Heart was not right before the Lord:</HI> And she was so reach'd, that afterwards she came to be convinc'd of God's Truth.</P>
<P>Then he came near <HI>Coldbeck,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coldbeck.</NOTE> to a Market-Town, where he had a Meeting at the Cross, and some received the Truth preached by him.</P>
<P>From thence he went to <HI>Carlisle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carlisle.</NOTE> where the Teacher of the <HI>Baptists,</HI> with most of his Hearers, came to the Abbey in which <HI>G. Fox</HI> had a Meeting. After the Meeting, the <HI>Baptist</HI> Teacher, who was a Notionist, and an airy Man, came to him, and ask'd, <HI>What must be damned?</HI> And he told him, <HI>That which spake in him was to be damned.</HI> And this stopt his Mouth. Then he opened to him the States of Election and Reproba∣tion, so that he said, <HI>He never heard the like in his Life;</HI> and came af∣terwards also to be convinced of the Truth. Then he went up to the Castle among the Soldiers, who by beating of the Drum called the Gar∣rison together. Amongst these he preached, <Q>Directing them to the Measure of the Spirit of Christ in themselves, by which they might be turned from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God: He warned them also to do no Violence to any Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> <HI>G. Fox</HI> having thus discharged himself, none opposed him, except the Serjeants, who afterwards came to be convinced. On the Market-day
<PB N="67" REF="003104_0078_0FEFF3B35FE859A8"/>
he went into the Market,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653</NOTE> tho' he had been threatned, that if he came there he would meet with rude Treatment. But he willing to obey God more than Man, shew'd himself undaunted, and going upon the Cross, he declared, <Q>That the Day of the Lord was coming upon all deceitful Ways and Doings, and deceitful Merchandize; and that they should put away all cozening and chea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and keep to <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Nay,</HI> and speak the Truth to one another.</Q></P>
<P>On the First Day following, he went into the Steeple-house, and after the Priest had done, he began to preach. Now the Priest going away, and the Magistrate desiring <HI>G. Fox</HI> to depart, he still went on, and told them, <HI>He came to speak the Word of Life and Salvation from the Lord amongst them.</HI> And he spoke so powerfully, that the People trembled and shook, and they thought the Steeple-house shook also; nay, some of them feared it would have fallen down on their Heads. Some Wo∣men in the mean while making a great Bustle, at length the rude People of the City rose, and came with Scaves and Stones into the Steeple-house. Whereupon the Governour sent some Musketeers to appease the Tumult; and these taking <HI>G. Fox</HI> by the Hand in a friendly Man∣ner, led him out. Then he came to the House of a Lieutenant, where he had a very quiet Meeting. The next Day the Justices and Magi∣strates sent for him to come before them in the Town-Hall. So he went thither, and had a long Discourse with them concerning Religion, and shew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them, that tho' they were great Professors (viz. <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Independents)</HI> yet they were without the Possession of what they professed. But after a long Examination, they committed him to Prison as a Blasphemer, an Heretick, and a Seducer. There he lay till the As∣sizes came on, and then all the Talk was, <HI>That he was to be hang'd:</HI> And the High Sheriff, <HI>Willfrey Lawson,</HI> was so eager to have his Life taken away,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sheriff</HI> Law∣son.</NOTE> that he said, <HI>He himself would guard</HI> G. Fox <HI>to Execution.</HI> This made such a Noise, that even great Ladies came to see him, as one that was to die. But tho' both Judge and Magistrates were contriving how they might put him to Death, yet the Judges Clark started a Question which puzzled them, and confounded their Councils, so that he was not brought to a Trial, as was expected▪ which however was contrary to Law. But such was their Envy against him, that the Jailor was ordered to put him among Thieves and Murderers, and some naugh∣ty Women; which wicked Crew was so lousy, that one Woman was almost eaten to Death with Lice: But what made the Prison the worse, there was no House of Office to it, and in this nasty Place, Men and Women were put together, against all Decency. Yet these Prisoners, how naught soever, were very loving to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and so hearkened to his whole∣some Counsel, that some of them became Converts. But the Under-Jailor did him all the Mischief he could. Once when he had been a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Grate to take in the Meat his Friends brought him, the Jailor fell a beating of him with a great Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gel, crying, <HI>Come out of the Window,</HI> tho' he was then far enough from it. But whilst the Jailor was thus beating him, he was so fill'd with Joy, that he began to sing, which made the other rage the more, so that he went and fetch'd a Fiddler, thinking thereby to vex him. But when this Fellow play'd, he sang a Hymn so loud, that with his Voice he drowned the Sound of the Fiddle, and thereby so confounded the Player, that he was fain to give over, and go his Ways.</P>
<P>Not long after, Justice <HI>Benson</HI>'s Wife felt her self moved to eat no Meat, but what she should eat with <HI>G. Fox</HI> at the Bars of the Dungeon-Window. Afterwards she herself was imprison'd at <HI>York,</HI> when she was big with Child, for having spoken, it's like, zealously to a Priest. And
<PB N="68" REF="003104_0079_0FEFF3B597685EE0"/>
when the Time of her Travel came,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Parnel</HI> vi∣siting <HI>G. Fox</HI> in <HI>Carlisle</HI> Dungeon, be∣comes a pow∣erful Mini∣ster of the Gospel.</NOTE> she was not suffer'd to go out, but was deliver'd of her Child in the Prison.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was in the Dungeon at <HI>Carlisle,</HI> there came to see him, one <HI>James Parnel,</HI> a little Lad of about sixteen Years of Age; and he was so effectually reach'd by the speaking of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> that he became convinc'd of the Truth of his Sayings; and notwithstanding his Youth, was by the Lord quickly made a powerful Minister of the Gospel, shew∣ing himself both with his Pen, and his Tongue, a zealous Promoter of Religion, altho' he underwent hard Sufferings on that Account, as will be mention'd hereafter. And so there were many others, who not sticking at any Adversities, came to be zealous Preachers of Repen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance. Among these was also <HI>Thomas Briggs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Brigg's</HI> Message of Repentance.</NOTE> already mention'd, who went thro' many Cities, Towns and Villages, with this Message: <HI>Repent, Repent, for the mighty terrible Day of the Lord God of Power is appearing, wherein no Worker of Iniquity shall stand before him, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; for he wills not he Death of a Sinner; and if ye repent, and turn to him, he will abundantly pardon.</HI> Sometimes he went into Markets and Steeple-houses, and was often cruelly abused. Once be∣ing in a Steeple-house at <HI>Warrington</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is cruelly abused at <HI>Warrinton</HI> in Lancashire.</NOTE> and speaking a few Words after the Priest had done, he was very violently knockt on his Head: After which, a Man taking hold of his Hair, smote him against a Stone, and pull'd off an Handful of it; which <HI>Thomas</HI> taking up from the Ground, mildly said, <HI>Not one Hair of my Head shall fall with∣out my Father's Permission.</HI> At another Time he speaking to a Priest in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> as he was going in his Journey, the Priest was much offended at him; and one of his Hearers, as it were in Revenge of this preten∣ded A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont, struck him on the Head, and knockt him down; but <HI>Thomas</HI> getting up again, and turning his Face to the Smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, he smote him on his Teeth, so that the Blood gush'd out exceedingly; which some of the Standers by could not but cry out against. But not long after, the Man that struck him thus, fell sick, and died, cry∣ing upon his Death-bed, <HI>Oh that I had not smitten the</HI> Quaker! This <HI>Thomas</HI> once going thro <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and calling the Inhabitants to Re∣pentance, was apprehended, and brought before several Justices, who profer'd him the Oath, under Pretence of his being a Jesuit. But he saying, He could not swear, because Christ had commanded, <HI>not to swear at all,</HI> was sent to Prison, where he was kept a Month. He also went up and down the Streets of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yarmouth.</NOTE> proclaiming <Q>The terrible Day of the Lord, that all might repent and fear Him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea.</Q> And being followed by a great Multitude of rude People; and turning about, he spoke so powerfully to them, and with such piercing Words, that they ran away for Fear. At length an Officer came and took hold of him; but leading him gently, he had Opportunity to continue preaching to the People, and to clear him∣self. And being brought before the Magistrates, they order'd him to be led out of the Town; which being done, <HI>Thomas</HI> came into the Town again by another Way, and having performed his Service there to his Satisfaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Lin</HI> a Ma∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff Dog set at him fawns upon him.</NOTE> he departed the Town. Being come to <HI>Lin,</HI> and warning People to repent, a great Mastiff Dog was set upon him; but the Dog coming near him, fawn'd upon him. Thus he went thro' many Places, passing sometimes five or six Towns in one Day; and tho' Swords were drawn against him, or Axes taken up to hew him down, yet he went on, and spoke so awfully, that even some, who did not sue his Face, were so reach'd by the Power that accompanied him, that they became Converts. Coming to <HI>Clayzons</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Stones cast upon him at <HI>Clayzons</HI> in <HI>Wales.</HI></NOTE> and many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing him attentively, the Constable stirr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d up the rude People, and cry'd, <HI>Kill him, kill him,</HI> as if<PB N="69" REF="003104_0080_0FEFF3B93A3D4570"/>
he had been a mad Dog; and they threw such g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Ston<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon him, that he admired they did not kill him; but he was preserved by such a mighty Power, that, according to his Relation, they were to him as a Nut, or a Bean. Many other rude Encounters he met with, but was preserved wonderfully in the greatest Dangers; which strengthened him not a little in the Belief, that God, who so miraculously sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him, did require this Service from him. He was also in <HI>America,</HI> and dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in a good old Age, after having labour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d about thirty Years in the Service o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Myles Halhead</HI> was also one of the first zealous Preachers among the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.

He was the first of those of his Persuasion that was imprison'd at <HI>Kendal.</HI> Once he went to <HI>Swarthmore</HI> to visit his Friends, and to assist at their Meeting: By the Way he met the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Justice <HI>Thomas Preston;</HI> and because he passed by her quietly, without the ordinary Way of Greeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Just▪ <HI>Preston's</HI> Wife's haugh∣ty and proud Carriage to him.</NOTE> she grew so offended, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he commanded her Man to go back and beat him; which he did: At which <HI>Myles</HI> be∣ing kindled with Zeal, said to her; <HI>O thou</HI> Jezabel! <HI>thou proud</HI> Jezabel! <HI>Can'st thou not permit and suffer the Servant of the Lord to pass by thee qui∣etly?</HI> She then held forth her Hands, as if she would have struck him, and spit in his Face, saying, <HI>I scorn to fall down at thy Words.</HI> This made <HI>Myles</HI> say again, <HI>Thou proud</HI> Jezabel <HI>thou that hardenest thy Heart, and brazenest thy Face against the Lord, and his Servant, the Lord will plead with thee in his own Time, and set in Order before thee the Things that thou hast done this Day to his Servant.</HI> And so he parted with her, and went to <HI>Swarthmore.</HI> About three Months after this he felt himself moved to go and speak to her; and when he came to <HI>Houlker-Hall,</HI> he asked for <HI>Thomas Preston</HI>'s Wife. She then coming to the Door, and <HI>Myles</HI> not knowing her, ask'd her, <HI>If she was the Woman of the House.</HI> To which she said, <HI>No; but if you would speak with Mistress</HI> Preston, <HI>I will entreat her to come to you.</HI> Then, she went in, and coming back with another Woman, said, <HI>Here is Mistress</HI> Preston. But then it was manifested to him, that she her self was the Woman. It is true, he had, as hath been said, some Time before, seen her on the Way, and spoken to her; but it may be she was then in so different a Dress, that by Reason thereof he did not now know her; yet firmly believing that it was she, he said, <HI>Woman, How darest thou lye before the Lord and his Servant? Thou art the Woman I came to speak to.</HI> And she being silent, not speaking a Word, he proceeded, <HI>Woman, hear what the Lord's Servant hath to say unto thee: O Woman, harden not thy Heart against thy Lord; for if thou dost he will cut thee off in his sore Displeasure; therefore take Warning in Time, and fear the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, that thou may'st end thy Days in Peace.</HI> Having said this, he went away, she, now proud soever, not doing him any Harm, being withheld, without knowing by what: But, notwithstanding that, she continu'd the same: For several Years after, when <HI>G. Fox</HI> was Prisoner at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> she came to him, and belch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out many railing Words, saying, amongst the rest; <HI>That his Tongue should be cut off, and he be hang'd.</HI> But some Time after the Lord cut her off, and she dy'd, as it was reported, in a miserable Con∣dition. But before I leave this Woman, I must also say; that about three Years after she had made her Man beat <HI>Myles,</HI> it happen'd that as he was riding from <HI>Swarthmore</HI> near to <HI>Houlker-Hall,</HI> he met with a Person who said to him, <HI>Friend, I have something to say unto you, which hath lain upon me this long Time. I am the Man that, about three Years ago, at the Command of my Mistress, did beat you very sore, for which I have been very much troubled, more than for any thing that ever I did in all my Life: For truly, Night and Day it hath been often in thy Heart, that I did not we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
<PB N="70" REF="003104_0081_0FEFF3BBDE054D80"/>
in beating an innocent Man, that never did me any Hurt or Harm. I pray you forgive me, and desire the Lord to forgive me, that I may be at Peace and quiet in my Mind.</HI> To this <HI>Myles</HI> answered, <HI>Truly Friend, from that Time to this Day, I never had any Thing in my Heart against thee, nor thy Mistress, but Love; the Lord forgive you both; I desire that it may never be laid to your Charge; for ye knew not what ye did.</HI> Here <HI>Myles</HI> stop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and so went his Ways. Many a notable Occurrence he had in his Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and therefore he is to appear yet more than once on the Course of this History.</P>
<P>Travelling once in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Laid for dead at <HI>Skipton</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></NOTE> he came to <HI>Skipton,</HI> where declaring the Word of Truth, he was so sorely abused and beaten, that he was said for dead; nevertheless, by the Lord's Power, he was healed of all his Bruises, and within three Hours, he was healthy and sound again, to the Astonishment of those that had so abused him, and to the con∣vincing of many that beheld him.</P>
<P>Then he went to <HI>Bradford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is persecuted in other Pla∣ces.</NOTE> Leeds,</HI> and <HI>Hallifax,</HI> where he also decla∣red the Doctrine of Truth amongst the People; but not without meet∣ing with great Persecution.</P>
<P>From thence he came to <HI>Doncaster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorely brui∣sed, and left for dead at <HI>Doncaster.</HI></NOTE> and there went on a First Day of the Week to a Steeple-house, where after the Worship was done, he spoke to the Priest and People: But they, instead or hearkening to what he said, fell upon him in a great Rage, and drove him out of the Town; and he being sorely bruised, they left him for dead. But before his going from home, he had been firmly perswaded, that the Lord would preserve him in all Dangers; and it happened so to him according to his Belief; for he got up again, and went to a Friend's House, where he laid himself down upon a Bed. But not long after, he felt a very strong Motion to go to a certain Chappel, and there to declare the Word of the Lord: Forthwith he felt also an inward As∣surance that if he gave up to do so, the Lord would heal him from his Bruises. Then he rose, as well as he could, and came down Stairs with great Difficulty, by taking hold of the Walls for a Stay; and going out, he began to mend by Degrees; and coming at length in∣to the Chappel, he spake as he was moved; and when he had cleared himself, he went back to the House from whence he came, and the Lord made him sound of all his Bruises.</P>
<P>From thence he went to <HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Travels thro' <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></NOTE> and there spoke to the Lord Mayor, and other Rulers of that City: And passing thro' <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> he went into several Steeple-houses to exhort the People: And tho' he met with great Hardships, yet he was supported by an invisible Hand. So being clear of that Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to his House at <HI>Un∣der-barrow</HI> in <HI>Westmor∣land</HI></NOTE> he returned to his House at <HI>Mountjoy</HI> in <HI>Ʋnder-barrow</HI> in the County of <HI>Westmorland.</HI> But his going thus often from home, was an exceeding great Cross to his Wife, who in the first Year of his Change, not being of his Perswasion, was very much troubled in her Mind, and would often say from Discontent, <HI>Would to God I had, married a Drunkard, then I might have found him at the Ale-house; but now I can't tell where to find my Husband.</HI> But after the Space of a Year, it pleased the Lord to visit her. She had a little Son of about five Years of Age, which Child the loved extraordinarily, insomuch, that she thought it was her only Delight and Comfort. But it happen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that this Darling dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and some Time after, she spoke thus to her Hus∣band;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A very re∣markable Oc∣currence.</NOTE> <HI>Truly Husband, I have something to tell thee: One Night, being in Bed, mourning and lamenting with Tears in my Eyes, I heard a Voice, saying,</HI> <Q>Why art thou so discontented concerning thy Husband: I have call'd and chosen him to my Work; my Right-hand shall uphold him; therefore be thou content, and pleased, that he serve me, and I will
<PB N="71" REF="003104_0082_0FEFF3BFEF3A2620"/>
bless thee, and thy Children for his Sake; and all Things shall pros∣per that thou shalt take in Hand. But if thou wilt not be content, but grudge, and murmur, and repine against me, and my Servant, whom I have chosen to do my Work, I will bring a greater Cross up∣on thee.</Q> <HI>These Words being fresh in my Mind both Night and Day; I often said within my self, What Cross can this be, that would be greater than the Want of my Husband? But for all this, I could not be content: All the Joy I had or could find, was in our little Boy, who would often, when he saw me weeping and mourning, take me about my Neck, and say,</HI> My dear Mo∣ther, pray be content, for my Father will come home in a little Time. <HI>This Child would often comfort me in this Manner; but for all that, I could not be content. Not long after it pleased the Lord to take from me this my only Son, my chiefest Joy. Then the Voice which I had heard, came into my Mind, and I perceiving that this was the Cross which the Lord would bring upon me, smote upon my Breast, and said within my self, that I was the very Cause why the Lord had taken away my little Son. A great Fear then seizing upon me, I said, O Lord my God! give me Power to be content to give up my Husband freely to do thy Will, lest, O Lord, thou take away from me all my Children. From that Time I never durst oppose thee, my Husband, any more in the Work of the Lord, for Fear that his Judgments might also fall upon me, and my Children.</HI> This served not a little to strengthen <HI>Myles</HI> and to encourage him. Some Time-after walking in his Garden, he felt a Motion to go to <HI>Stanly</HI> Chappel in <HI>Lancashire.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stanly <HI>Chap∣pel in</HI> Lanca∣shire.</NOTE> Now tho' he might expect to meet with rude Entertainment there, yet he consulted not with Flesh and Blood, but went to the aforesaid Chappel. Being come, he was not suffered to enter, but the Door was violently turned against him. Then he walked in the Yard till the Worship was done, and then the People that came out, (one may guess how edify'd) fell upon him with great Rage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Capt.</HI> Raw∣linson</NOTE> and one Captain <HI>William Rawlinson</HI> took hold of his Arms and Shoulders, and calling another Man to take him by the Feet and Legs, they threw him over the Wall; by which Fall he was exceedingly bruis∣ed, so that he had much to do to get home. By the Way it was inwardly said to him, <Q>That he must be content with what was befa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n him that Day, and that if he was faithful in what the Lord required of him, then he would heal him again.</Q> Being come home, he wait∣ed upon the Lord to know his Will. In this Resignedness, within six Days, he was moved to go to <HI>Windermore</HI> Steeple-house, and it was, as it were, said unto him, <Q>Fear not the Face of any Man, but speak the Word of the Lord freely; and then thou shalt be made sound again of all thy Bruises. So he went to the said Steeple-house, and having spoke to the Priest and the People the Word of the Lord, with∣out receiving any Harm, he was healed that Day of his sore Bruises.</Q></P>
<P>Sometime after by another Motion he came to <HI>Furneiss</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Furneiss <HI>in</HI> Lancashire. <HI>Capt.</HI> Sands-<HI>Priest</HI> Lam∣pitt.</NOTE> to the House of Captain <HI>Adam Sands,</HI> where he found a great Number of Professors gather'd, and Priest <HI>Lampitt</HI> preaching. But as soon as <HI>Myles</HI> enter'd, <HI>Lampitt</HI> was silent, which continuing a pretty while, Captain <HI>Sands</HI> said to him, <HI>Sir, What's the Matter? Are you not well?</HI> To which the Priest answer'd, <HI>I am well, but I shall speak no more as long as this dumb Devil is in the House. A dumb Devil,</HI> said the Captain, <HI>Where is he? This is he,</HI> said the Priest, pointing with his Hand, <HI>that standeth there.</HI> Then the Captain said, <HI>This Man is quiet, and saith nothing to you: I pray you,</HI> Sir, <HI>go on in the Name of the Lord; and if he trouble or molest you in my House, I will send him to</HI> Lancaster <HI>Castle.</HI> But the Priest said again, <HI>I shall not preach as long as this dumb Devil is in the House.</HI> Then the Captain said to one <HI>Camelford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Priest</HI> Camel∣ford.</NOTE> a Priest also, <HI>I pray you</HI> Sir, <HI>stand up, and exercise your Gift, and I will see that you be not disturbed.</HI> But this Priest
<PB N="72" REF="003104_0083_0FEFF3C19B6123D8"/>
answered as the other, <HI>I shall not speak as long as this dumb Devil is in the House.</HI> Then the People cry'd, <HI>Lord, rebuke thee Satan, Lord, rebuke thee, Satan: What Manner of Spirit is this that stops our Ministers Mouths?</HI> Then the Captain came to <HI>Myles,</HI> and taking him by the Hand, led him out of the House. In all that Time he had not spoke a Word, and saw now the Accomplishment of what he had been per∣suaded of before, <HI>viz.</HI> That an invisible Power would confound by him the Wisdom of the Priests, when he spoke never a Word. The said <HI>Camelford</HI> was one, who a good while before had stirred up the Rabble against <HI>G. Fox;</HI> and the other was that <HI>Lampitt,</HI> who has been mention'd already, and who had been so esteemed by <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> before she came to be acquainted with <HI>G. Fox.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after this Occurrence, <HI>Myles</HI> went to <HI>New-castle,</HI> and there said to the Mayor, Rulers, and Priests of that Town, <HI>That God's Anger was kindled against them, because they had shut the Kingdom of Heaven against Men, and would not enter themselves, nor suffer them that would.</HI> Be∣cause of this he was imprisoned: But the Mayor being much troubled, sent for the Sheriff, (for these two had committed <HI>Myles</HI> to Prison;) when come, he said to him, <HI>We have not done well in committing an innocent Man to Prison: Pray let us release him.</HI> The Sheriff consenting, <HI>Myles</HI> was set at Liberty. Then he declared the Word of the Lord in those Parts, and many were convinced of the Truth held forth by him. But now I part with this <HI>Myles Halhead,</HI> who hereafter is to be men∣tion'd again.</P>
<P>About this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secular Transactions.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> in the Summer, General <HI>Cromwel</HI> had called a new Parliament, consisting mostly (as hath been said by some) of Members of his own Choice; for it was a certain Number of Persons out of each County and City in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> nomi∣nated by the Council of Officers, and sent for to meet at <HI>Westminster:</HI> Into the Hands of these <HI>Cromwel</HI> delivered the Supreme Authority of the Nation, by an Instrument, or Commission, signed by himself and the Officers; but the Authority of this Meeting lasted scarce half a Year, as will be said in the Sequel. To this Parliament a Report was made, <HI>That at</HI> Carlisle <HI>a Person was imprisoned, who was to die for Religion.</HI> This was <HI>G. Fox,</HI> whom we have left thus long in the Dungcon at <HI>Carlisle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Fox <HI>in</HI> Carlisle <HI>Dun∣geon.</HI></NOTE> and now are returning to him again. The Parliament then caused a Letter to be sent down concerning him to the Sheriff, and other Magistrates: And <HI>G. Fox</HI> knowing how scandalously he had been belied about speaking blasphemous Words, gave forth a Paper, wherein he challenged all who found Fault with his Doctrine, to ap∣pear in publick; since he was ready to stand the Test of whatsoever he might have spoken. He also wrote a significant Letter to the Ju∣stices at <HI>Carlisle,</HI> wherein he shewed them plainly the Injustice of their Dealings, and the horrid Evil of Persecution, as having been always the Work of the false Church. Mention hath been made already of the Justices <HI>Benson</HI> and <HI>Anthony Pearson:</HI> These had desired, more than once, Leave to visit <HI>G. Fox</HI> in Prison; but this being denied them, they wrote a Letter to the Magistrates, Priests, and People, at <HI>Carlisle;</HI> where∣in they emphatically described the Wickedness of Persecution, and what would be the Reward of Persecutors; saying also, that these were worse than the Heathen, that put <HI>Paul</HI> into Prison; because none of his Friends or Acquaintance were hindred by them from coming to him. However, at length <HI>Pearson</HI> got an Opportunity to come with the Governour into the Dungeon where <HI>G. Fox</HI> was kept; and they found the Place so bad, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so noisom a Smell, that the Gover∣nour cried Shame of the Magistrates, for suffering the Jailor to treat

<HI>G. Fox</HI> after such a Manner; and calling the Jailors into the Dungeon, required them to find Sureties for their good Behaviour, and put the Under-Jailor, who had been very cruel to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> into the Dungeon with him. In the mean while, those who had imprisoned <HI>G. Fox,</HI> began to grow afraid, the rather it may be, because the Parliament took No∣tice of these Doings; and it was not long after, that he was released, and then coming to the House of one <HI>Thomas Bewly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

The <HI>Baptist,</HI> who went along with him, had his Sword taken from him, and was sorely beaten with it; yet this did not frighten or discourage him; and he not only left off the Wearing of a Sword; but also freely gave up the Inheritance of an Impropriation of Tythes. The same Day that this Preacher was thus attacked with his own Sword, being the First of the Week, several of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Friends, and among them <HI>William Dewsbury,</HI> went, one to this, and others to other Steeple-houses; and by such Means the Num∣ber of the said Friends increased; tho' <HI>Dewsbury</HI> at that Time was so violently beaten by the People, that he was almost kill'd; but the Lord's Power healed him again.

Widders <HI>reproves Priest</HI> Nic∣hols <HI>at</HI> Ack∣ton.</NOTE> that he went, the same Day in the Afternoon, seven Miles to <HI>Ackton</HI> Steeple-house, where he spoke to Priest <HI>Nichols,</HI> and calling him an <HI>Enemy of Christ,</HI> told him also, that <HI>the Hand of the Lord was against him.</HI> Then <HI>William Briscoe</HI> a Justice of <HI>Croston,</HI> commanded the Con∣stable to secure <HI>Robert;</HI> which he did, and carried him to the Priest's House, where being examined by the Justice, the Priest began to fawn upon him: Thereupon <HI>Robert</HI> told the Priest, That <HI>the Spirit of Persecu∣tion lodged in him.</HI> But the Priest said, <HI>No, he was not such a Man.</HI> Yet presently after he said to the Justice, <HI>that</HI> Robert <HI>had s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oln the Horse he came with,</HI> and <HI>that he could find in his Heart to be his Executioner with his own Hands;</HI> which made <HI>Robert</HI> say, <HI>Did not I say unto thee, that the Spirit of Persecution lodged in thee?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">For which Ju∣stice <HI>Briscoe</HI> gives a War∣rant to have him to <HI>Car∣lisle</HI> Jail.</NOTE> Then the aforesaid Justice wrote a Warrant to send <HI>Robert</HI> to <HI>Carlisle</HI> Jail; and after having given the Warrant to the Constable, he asked <HI>Robert, by what Authority or Power he came to seduce and bewitch People?

He also spoke to the People,
<PB N="74" REF="003104_0085_0FEFF3C779F9A8D8"/>
and to Justice <HI>Coats,</HI> bidding them to mind the Word of God in the Heart, which di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d between the Precious and the Vile. After having clear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself, he went to a Place where a few of his Friends were met together; but he had not been long there, when there came some Horse∣men and Foot, who took him away, and carried him to the said Justice; who examining him, said, <HI>He had broken the Law, by disturbing the Mini∣ster and the People, and that he might send him Prisoner to</HI> York-Castle. <HI>Robert</HI> answered, <HI>Send me to Jail thither, if thou darest; for I appeal to the Witness of God in thy Conscience.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">who kindly lets him go.</NOTE> But the Justice being a moderate Man, said, <HI>I neither dare nor will;</HI> and taking <HI>Robert</HI> by the Hand told him, he might take his own Time in going away.</P>
<P>To relate all the Occurrences of this <HI>Robert Widders,</HI> would be too prolix; therefore I'll only say, that as he was very zealous in speaking to the Priests, so he suffered very much in his Estate, because for Con∣science-sake he refused to pay them Tythes; and on that Account there was taken from him, at sundry Times, to the value of 143 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> besides what he suffered for Meetings, and for <HI>Sunday</HI> Shillings, so call'd, which also amounted to a considerable Sum. And this not only bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l him, but it was the Portion of many Hundreds, nay perhaps Thousands of those of his Perswasion: Wherefore I won't undertake to relate all that might be mention'd of this Kind; for that would be beyond my Reach. How∣ever, by this that hath been said, may be seen, by what Means the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> so called, grew so numerous in those early Times. As on one Hand, there were raised zealous Preachers; so on the other, there were Abundance of People in <HI>England,</HI> who having searched all Sects, could no where find Satisfaction for their hungry Souls. And these now un∣derstanding that God by his Light was so near in their Hearts, began to take Heed thereunto, and soon found, that this gave them far more Victory over the Corruption of their Minds, (under which they had long groaned) than all the self-will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Worships which they with some Zeal had performed many Years. And besides those that were thus pre∣pared to receive a farther Manifestation of the Way of Life, there were also many of a rude Life, who being prick'd to the Heart, and brought over by the Christian Patience of the despised <HI>Quakers,</HI> became as zea∣lous in doing Good, as formerly they had been in working Evil.</P>
<P>But perhaps some will think it was very indecent that they went so frequently to the Steeple-houses, and there spoke to the Priests: But whatsoever any may judge concerning this, it is certain that those Teach∣ers generally did not bring forth the Fruits of Godliness, as was well known to those who themselves had been Priests, and freely resigned their Ministry, thenceforth to follow Christ in the Way of his Cross; and these were none of the least zealous against that Society among whom they formerly had ministred with an upright Zeal. Yet they were not for using sharp Language against such Teachers, who, according to their Knowledge, feared God; but they levelled their Aim chiefly against those who were only rich in Words, without bringing forth true Chri∣stian Fruits, and Works of Justice. Hence it was, that one <HI>Thomas Curtis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Curtis</HI> writes to Priest <HI>Wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of <HI>Banbury</HI></NOTE> who was formerly a Captain in the Parliament Army, but after∣wards entred into the Society of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> wrote, in a Letter to <HI>Samuel Wells,</HI> Priest of <HI>Banbury,</HI> and a Persecutor of those of that Perswasion, amongst other Things, these Words; <HI>To thy Shame, remem∣ber I know thee scandalous: How often hast thou sate Evening after Evening at Cards, and sometimes whole Nights playing, and sometimes compelling me to play with thee for Money; yet then thou wast called of the World a Minister; and now art thou turn'd Persecutor,</HI> &amp;c. None therefore need think it strange, that those called <HI>Quakers</HI> did look upon such Teachers as Hirelings: And
<PB N="75" REF="003104_0086_0FEFF3CB40E83168"/>
that there were not a few of that Sort, appeared plainly when King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. was restored; for those who had formerly cry'd out against Episcopacy, and its Liturgy, as false and idolatrous, then be∣came Turncoats, and put on the Surplice, to keep in the Possession of their Livings and Benefices. But by so doing, these Hypocrites lost not a few of their Auditors; for this opened the Eyes of many, who began to enquire into the Doctrine of the despised <HI>Quakers,</HI> and saw that they had a more sure Foundation, and that this it was which made them stand unshaken against the Fury of Persecution.</P>
<P>Let us again take up the Thread of those Transactions which con∣cern <HI>G. Fox:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> tra∣vels in the North of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> Who now travelling thro' many Places in the North of <HI>England,</HI> had every where great Meetings; but now and then met with some Opposition; sometimes with Hands, and at other Times with the Tongue:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Darwent-wa∣ter.</NOTE> Among the rest, at <HI>Darwantwater</HI> in <HI>Northumberland;</HI> where in a Dispute recommending Perfection, he was contradicted; but to prove his Position, he said, <Q>That <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were perfect before they fell; and all that God made was perfect; and that the Imperfe∣ction came by the Devil and the Fall; but that Christ, who came to destroy the Devil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. v. 48. Joh. iv. 17. Ch. xv. 15. Ch. iv. 18.</NOTE> said, <HI>Be ye perfect.</HI></Q> To this one of the Pro∣fessors answer'd, That <HI>Job</HI> said, <HI>Shall mortal Man be more pure than his Maker? The Heavens are not clear in his Sight. God charged his An∣gels with Folly.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> shew'd him his Mistake, and told him, <Q>That it was not <HI>Job</HI> that said so, but one of those that contended against him.</Q> Then the Professors said, <HI>The outward Body was the Body of Death and Sin.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> replied, <Q>That <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had each of them an outward Body, before the Body of Death and Sin got into them; and that Men would have Bodies, when the Body of Sin and Death was put off again, and they were renewed into the Image of God again by Christ Jesus.</Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>G. Fox</HI> found almost every where Work, and passing to <HI>Hexam,</HI> he had a great Meeting there on the Top of a Hill. The Priest indeed had threatned, that he would come and oppose; but he came not.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> then travelling on, came into <HI>Cumberland,</HI> where he had a Meet∣ing of many Thousands of People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Langlands▪ Brigham.</NOTE> on a Hill near <HI>Langlands.</HI> Once he came into <HI>Brigham</HI> Steeple-house, before the Priest was there, and de∣clared the Truth to the People; but when the Priest came in, he began to oppose, but was wearied so, that at length he went away. There being now also several others who preached the Doctrine of the inward Light of God which convinceth Man of Sin, the Number of those Pro∣fessors of the Light increased greatly: And as it had been said at first, <HI>That they should be destroyed within a short Time;</HI> so now the Priests began to say, <HI>That they would eat out one another:</HI> For many of them, after Meetings, having a great Way to go, staid at their Friends Houses by the Way, and sometimes more than there were Beds to lodge in, so that some lay on the Hay-Mows. This made some of the publick Church grow afraid, that this Hospitality would cause Poverty, and that when these Friends had eaten out one another, they would come to be maintained by the Parishes, and so be chargeable to them. But it sell out quite otherwise, for these People wore the more blessed, and en∣creased, without falling into Want. This puts me mind of what one of the Daughters of Judge <HI>Thomas Fell</HI> once told me, <HI>viz.</HI> That her Father having been abroad, and coming home with his Servants, found the Shed so full of the Horses of strange Guests, (for <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife had cleared the Stable where they first stood, to make Room for her Husband's own Horses) that he said to his Wife, <HI>This was the Way to be eaten out, and that thus they themselves should soon be in Want of Hay.</HI> But
<PB N="76" REF="003104_0087_0FEFF3CD1F431CE0"/>
to this <HI>Margaret</HI> said in a Friendly Way, <HI>That she did not belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when the Year was at an End, they should have the less for that.</HI> And it so fell out; for this Year their Stock of Hay was such, that they sold a great Parcel of what they had in Abundance. Thus the Proverb was verify'd, That <HI>Charity doth not impoverish.</HI> The Truth of this was also experienced by those called <HI>Quakers;</HI> for tho' many People at first were shy, and would not deal with them, because of their Nonconfor∣mity with the vulgar Salutation, and their saying <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee</HI> to a single Person, instead of <HI>You,</HI> &amp;c. insomuch, that some that were Trades∣men, lost their Customers, and could hardly get Money enough to buy Bread: Yet this changed in Time, when People found by Experience they could better trust to the Words of these, than to that of those of their own Persuasion. Hence it was, that often when any came into a Town, and wanted something, they would ask, <HI>Where dwells a Draper, or Taylor, or Shoemaker,</HI> or any other Tradesman, <HI>that is a</HI> Quaker? But this so exasperated others, that they began to cry out, <HI>If we let these</HI> Quakers <HI>alone, they will take the Trade of the Nation out of our Hands.</HI> Now the Cause of their Trade's thus encreasing, was, because they were found upright in their Dealing; for Integrity did then shine out among them above many others: To this the true Fear of God led them, and to this they were exhorted from Time to Time. <HI>G. Fox</HI> also wrote a General Epistle to them, which was as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>To you all, <HI>Friends</HI> every where, scattered abroad.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the Measure of the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>God</HI> wait for <HI>Wisdom</HI> from <HI>God,</HI> even from him, from whence it comes. And all ye, who be <HI>Babes</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> Wait for the <HI>Living Food</HI> from the <HI>Living</HI> to be nourished up to Eternal Life, from the one Fountain, from whence Life comes; that orderly and in Order ye may all be guided and walk: Servants in your Places, Young-Men and Young-Women in your Places, and Rulers of Families, that every one, in your respective Places may adorn the Truth, every one in the Measure of it. With it let your Minds be kept up to the Lord Jesus, from whence it doth come; that a sweet Savour ye may be to <HI>God,</HI> and in Wisdom ye may all be ordered and ruled: that a Crown and a Glory ye may be one to another in the Lord. And that no Strife, nor Bitterness, nor Self-Will may appear amongst you; but with the Light, in which the Unity is, all <HI>That</HI> may be condemned. And that every one in particular may see to, and take Care of the ordering and ruling of their own Family; that in the Righteousness and Wisdom it may be governed, the Fear and Dread of the Lord in every one's Heart set, that the Secrets of the Lord every one may come to receive, that Stewards of his Grace you may come to be, to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ense it to every one as they have Need; and so in savouring and right-discerning you may all be kept: That nothing, that is contrary to the pure Life of God, may be brought forth in you, or among you; but all that is contrary to it, may by it be judged: So that in Light, in Life and Love, ye may all live; and all that is contrary to the Light, and Life, and Love, may be brought to Judgment, and by that Light condemned. And that no fruitless Trees be among you; but all cut down and condemned by the Light, and cast into the Fire; so that every one may bear and bring forth Fruit to God, and grow fruitful in his Knowledge, and in his Wisdom. And so that none may appear in Words beyond what they be in the Life, that gave forth the Words: Here none shall be as the untimely Figs; and none shall be of those Trees, whose

Fruit withers: Such go in <HI>Cain</HI>'s Way, from the Light; and by it are condemned. And that none amongst you boast your selves above your Measure; for if you do, out of God's Kingdom you are ex∣cluded; for in that Boasting Part gets up the Pride, and the Strife, which is contrary to the Light; which Light leads to the Kingdom of God, and gives every one of you an En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance thereinto, and an Understanding, to know the Things that belong to the Kingdom of God. And there the Light and Life of Man every one receives Him, who was, before the World was, by whom it was made; who is the Righteousness of God; and his Wisdom; to whom all Glory, Honour, Thanks and Praise belongs, who is God blessed for ever. Let no Image, nor Likeness be made; but in the <HI>Light wait,</HI> which will bring Condemnation on that Part, that would make the Images; for that prisons the Just. So to the Lust yeild not the Eye, nor the Flesh; for the Pride of Life stands in That, which keeps out of the Love of the Father; and upon which his Judgments and Wrath remains, where the Love of the World is sought after, and a Crown that is Mortal; in which Ground the Evil enters, which is cursed; which brings forth Briars and Thorns, where the Death reigns, and Tribulation and Anguish is upon every Soul, and the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tongue is heard: All which is by the Light condemned. And there the Earth is, which must be removed. By the Light it is seen, and by the Power it is removed, and out of its Place it is shaken; to which the Thunders utter their Voices, before the Mysteries of God be opened, and Jesus revealed. Therefore, all ye, whose Minds are turn∣ed to this Light (which brings Condemnation upon all those Things before-mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that are contrary to the Light) wait upon the Lord Jesus for the Crown, that is Immortal, and that fadeth not away.</P>

One of these was called <HI>John ap-John,</HI> and continuing faithful, became a Minister of the Gospel he had thus re∣ceived; but the other afterwards departed from his Convincement.</P>
<P>Let's now take a short View of State-Affairs in <HI>England.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Public Trans∣actions.</NOTE> We have seen already <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Power so great, that he ventur'd to dissolve the Long Parliament, and that he called another in its Room. But before the Year's End, this Parliament resign'd their Power into the Hands of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> from whom they had received it. Thus he, with his Council of Field-Officers, saw himself again in the Possession of the supreme Government: And it was not long before this Council declared: <Q>That henceforth the chief Rule of the Nation should be intrusted to a single Person, and that this Person should be <HI>OLIVER CROM∣WEL,</HI> Chief General of all the Forces in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> That his Title should be <HI>LORD PROTECTOR</HI> of the Commonwealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and all the Domi∣nions belonging thereunto: A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was to have a Council of twenty one Persons to assist him in the Government.</Q></P>
<P>This Matter being thus stated, the Commissioners of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat Seal, and the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> were requir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, on the 16th of <HI>December,</HI> to attend <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and his Council in <HI>Westminster-Hall.</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="003104_0089_0FEFF3D348CA61A8"/>
Being come thither, the Instrument of Government was read, whereby <HI>Cromwel</HI> was declared Protector, he standing all this while bare∣headed, and Major General <HI>Lambert</HI> kneeling, presented him with a Sword in the Scabbard, representing the Civil Sword; which <HI>Cromwel</HI> accepting, put off his own, to intimate thereby, that he would no longer rule by the Military Sword. The said Instrument, being writ on Parch∣ment, contained, <Q>That the Protector was to call a Parliament every three Years: That their first Meeting should be on the 13th of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> next ensuing: That it should not be permitted to dissolve a Parliament before it had sat five Months: That the Bills presented to him for his Consent, if he did not confirm them within twenty Days, should have the Force of Laws: That he was to have a Council, who were not to exceed the Number of Twenty one, and not to be under Thirteen: That forthwith after his Death, the Council was to chuse another Protector: That no Protector after him should be capable of being Chief General of the Army: And that it should be in the Power of the Protector to make War and Peace.</Q> Whilst this Instrument was reading, <HI>Cromwel</HI> held his Hand on the Bible, and after∣wards took the Oath, That he would perform all that was contain'd therein. This being done, he cover'd himself, all the others remain∣ing uncover'd. Then the Commissioners deliver'd the Seals to him, and the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> the Sword, all which he restored again, with an Exhortation to use them well. Afterward General <HI>Lambert</HI> carried the Sword before him to his Coach; in which he went to <HI>White-hall,</HI> where he was proclaimed Protector, which was done also in the City of <HI>London.</HI> Now he was attended like a Prince, and he created Knights, as Kings use to do. Thus <HI>Cromwel,</HI> by a singular, and very strange Turn of mundane Affairs, saw himself plac'd in the Palace, from whence he, and his Adherents had cast out King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS. The THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OLiver Cromwel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1654</NOTE> in the Beginning of the Year, 1654, seeing him∣self invested with the Supreme Authority of the Nation, re∣quir'd, both of the Soldiers and others, the Oath of Fidelity.

Among these was <HI>John Stubs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Stubs,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> learned Man, convinced by <HI>G.

But some of the Soldiers, who had been convin∣ced in their Judgment, not continuing stedfast, took the requir'd Oath, but not long outliv'd it; for marching afterwards into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and passing by a Garrison there, these thinking they had been Enemies, fir'd at them, whereby several were kill'd.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> now seeing the Churches of his Friends in the North settled, passed from <HI>Swarthmore</HI> (where he was about the Beginning of this Year) to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Synder-hill-green,</HI> where he had a great Meeting of some Thousands of People, among whom were many Persons of Note; and a general Convincement there was, so that a great Num∣ber enter'd into the Communion of those call'd <HI>Quakers;</HI> with whom about this Time was also united <HI>Ambrose Rigg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.

<P>We have seen the first Rise of these Christians, call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and how they encreased under the Oppression of Persecution, so that in most Places in those Parts, Meetings were set∣tled: It remains to relate how they spread farther.</P>
<P>There were how above sixty Ministers of the Word raised among them, and these went out in the Service of the Gospel, to turn People, where they could have an Opportunity, from Darkness to the Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. Of these <HI>Francis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> went to <HI>London; John Camm,</HI> and <HI>John A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and</HI> to <HI>Bristol; Richard Hubberthorn,</HI> and <HI>George Whitehead</HI> to <HI>Norwich; Thomas Holmes</HI> into <HI>Wales,</HI> and others other Ways. <HI>G.

But when <HI>F. Howgill,</HI> and <HI>E.

<P>At <HI>London</HI> there is a Custom in Summer-time, when the Evening ap∣proaches, and Tradesmen leave off working, that many lusty Fellows meet in the Fields to try their Skill and Strength in wrestling, where generally a Multitude of People stands gazing in a Round.

Burrough</HI> past by the Place where they were wrestling, and standing still among the Spectators, saw how a strong and dexterous Fellow had already thrown three others, and was waiting for a fourth Champion, if any du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st venture to enter the Lists. At length, none being bold enough to try, <HI>E. Burrough</HI> stept into the Ring, commonly made up of all Sorts of People: And having look'd upon the Wrestler with a serious Countenance, the Man was not a little surprized, instead of an airy Antagonist, to meet with a grave and awful young Man; and all stood as it were amazed at this Sight, eagerly expecting what would be the Issue of this Combat. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was quite another Fight <HI>E. Burrough</HI> aim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at. For having already sought against Spiritual Wickedness, that had once prevailed on him, and having overcome in Measure by the Grace of God, he now endeavour'd also to fight against it in others, and to turn them from the Evil of their Ways. With this Intention he began very seriously to speak to the Standers by, and that with such a heart-piercing Power, that he was heard by this mixt Multitude with no less Attention than Admiration; for his Speech tended to turn them from Darkness to the Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. To effect this, he labour'd with convincing Words, shewing, How God had not left himself without a Witness, but had given to Man a Measure of his Grace, and enlighten'd every one with the Light of Christ. Thus he preached zealously: And tho' many might look upon this as a Novelty, yet it was of such Effect, that some were convinced of the Truth; for he was a Breaker of stony Hearts, and therefore, by a certain Author, not unjustly called, <HI>A Son of Thunder;</HI> tho' he also omitted not in due Season to speak a Word of Con∣solation to those that were of a broken Heart, and of a contrite Spirit: But to thunder against Sin and Iniquity was his peculiar Talent; inso∣much, that once preaching very zealously in a Meeting, and perceiving there were some contrite Souls, that wanted spiritually refreshing Food, he was heard to intimate, That tho' his present Speaking was not Milk for Babes, yet he would remember such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and administer to them also; but now, <HI>He must thresh the Whore.</HI> And indeed he was one of
<PB N="81" REF="003104_0092_0FEFF3DB00F4C428"/>
those Valiants, whose Bow never turned back, nor Sword empty from the Slaughter of the Mighty: For the Lord blessed his powerful Mini∣stry with very glorious Success; nay, he was such an excellent Instru∣ment in the Hand of God, that even some mighty and em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Men were touched to the Heart by the Power of the Word of Life which he preached. And altho' Coals of Fire, as it were, came forth of his Mouth to the consuming of Briars and Thorns, and he passing thro' un∣beaten Paths, trampled upon wild Thistles, and luxuriant Tares; yet his wholesom Doctrine dropp'd as the Oil of Joy upon the Spirits of the Mourners in <HI>Sion.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">F. Howgill.</NOTE> Hence it was that <HI>Francis Howgill</HI> not unjustly said of him when deceas'd: <Q>Shall Days, or Months, or Years wear out thy Name, as tho' thou hadst had no Being? Oh nay: Shall not thy noble and valiant Acts, and mighty Works which thou hast wrought, thro' the Power of him that separated thee from the Womb, live in Generations to come? Oh yes! The Children that are yet un∣born shall have thee in their Mouths, and thy Works shall testify of thee in the Generations, who yet have no Being.</Q></P>
<P>The said <HI>Howgill,</HI> also an eminent and eloquent Man being now at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> went to Court, to utter what was in his Mind to <HI>Oliver Cromwel:</HI> And after having spoke to him, he thought it convenient to express himself farther in Writing, as he did by the following Letter.</P>

Wherefore thus saith the Lord, wilt thou limit me, and set Bounds to me, when, and where, and how, and by whom I shall declare my self, and publish my Name? then will I break thy Cord, and remove thy Stake, and exalt my self in thy Overthrow. Therefore this is the Word of the Lord to thee, whether thou wilt hear, or forbear; if thou take not away all those Laws which are made concerning Re∣ligion, whereby the People which are dear in mine Eyes are oppres∣sed, thou shalt not be established; but as thou hast trodden down my Enemies by my Power, so shalt thou be trodden down by my Power; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for my Gospel

</LETTER>
<P>How this was receiv'd, I am not acquainted; but this I have under∣stood, that some or <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Servants and among these one <HI>Theophilus Green,</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> afterwards Wife of <HI>John Stout,</HI> were so reach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by <HI>F. Howgill</HI>'s Discourse, that after some Time, they enter'd into the So∣ciety of the <HI>Quakers</HI> so call'd.</P>
<P>Now in the said Letter, or Speech, we find Notice taken of <HI>Laws made concerning Religion:</HI> These I do not look upon as made by the In∣duction of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> but such as were made in former Times, which he could have alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d if he would have done it, as afterwards many Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Laws were abrogated, under the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> as will be said in its proper Place. For I don't find that in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Time any Laws were made to constrain People to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equent the Worship of the publick or National Church. But notwithstanding the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, were imprison<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>using to swear, or for not paying Tythes, to maintain the Priests; and they were whipp'd like Vagabonds; for preaching in Markets, or in other publick Places; or they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined for not taking off their Hats before Magistrates; for this was called <HI>Contempt of the Magistracy;</HI> and when for Conscience Sake they refused to pay such a Fine, either the Spoiling of Goods, or Imprisonment be∣came their Share. And thus always a Cloak or Cover was found to persecute them; and Malice never wanted Pretences to vex them. And it also often happen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> and <HI>F. Howgill</HI> were opposed by the Chiefest of several Sects, whereby Disputes were raised, which many Times gave Occasion for some of the Hearers to embrace the Doctrine maitain'd by the said <HI>Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Howgill;</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their Enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first set∣tled Meeting in <HI>London</HI> at <HI>Sarah Saw∣y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI>Al∣dersgate-street.</HI></NOTE> that no Slanders were spared, and they sometimes branded them as Witches.

<P>The Number of the said People encreasing at <HI>London</HI> from Time to Time, several Meetings were now erected there, one of which was in the House of one — <HI>Bates,</HI> in <HI>Tower-Street;</HI> and another at <HI>Gerard Roberts</HI>'s, in <HI>Thomas Apostles,</HI> until the Church became so great, that a House known by the Name of the <HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> in <HI>Martins le Grand</HI> near <HI>Aldersgate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bull <HI>and</HI> Mouth <HI>in</HI> Martins le Grand <HI>hired for a Meeting-house.</HI></NOTE> was hired for a Meeting-house; and it being a Build∣ing that had belong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to some great Man, there was a large Hall in it that would hold many People, and so was very convenient for a Meeting-Place.</P>
<P>Abundance of Books were now spread against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as Seducers and fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Prophets; and these written by the Priests and Teachers of seve∣ral Sects: For they perceiving that many of their Hearers forsook them, left no Stone unturn'd to stop it. But the Event did not answer their Hope, since <HI>Burrough</HI> and <HI>Howgill</HI> did not suffer those Writings to go un∣answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, but clearly shewed the Malice and Absurdities of those Wri∣ters.</P>
<P>Leaving them busie with this Work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Audland <HI>and</HI> T.

<P>From thence they went to <HI>Plymouth</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Go from thence to <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> and <HI>London.</HI> Return to <HI>Bristol</HI> with <HI>J.

Here Persecu∣tion arises,</NOTE> and so to <HI>London,</HI> where they met with <HI>John Camm;</HI> but after some Stay there, <HI>John Aud∣land</HI> return'd to <HI>Bristol</HI> with <HI>John Camm,</HI> and found there a Door open'd for their Ministry. Among those that did receive their Testimony, were <HI>Josiah Cole, George Bishop, Charles Marshal,</HI> and <HI>Barbara Blaugdone,</HI> concern∣ing which Persons, more is to be said hereafter. It was not long ere <HI>F Howgill</HI> and <HI>E. Burrough,</HI> having gather'd a Church at <HI>London,</HI> came also to <HI>Bristol,</HI> where Persecution now began to appear with open Face: For the Magistrates commanded them to depart the City and the Liberties thereof; to which they answer'd, <HI>That they came not in the Will of Man; and that when He who moved them to come thither, did move them also to depart, they should obey. That if they were guilty of the Transgression of any Law, they were not unwilling to suffer by it: That they were free-born</HI> Englishmen, <HI>being free from the Transgression of any Law: And that if by Violence thy were put out of the City, they were ready to suffer, and would not resist.</HI> And so they departed out of the Presence of the Rulers. But now the Priests, especially one <HI>Ralph Farmer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thro' Instiga∣tion of the Priests.</NOTE> began to incite and enrage the People, and to set the City, as it were, on Fire. Hence it was that <HI>J. Camm</HI> and <HI>J. Audland,</HI> intend∣ing to have a Meeting at <HI>Brislington,</HI> about two Miles from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and passing over a Bridge, were assaulted by the Rabble of the City, and several Apprentices of <HI>Farmer's</HI> Parish, who having got Notice of their coming, were gathered there, and violently abused them with Beating, Kicking, and a continual Cry, <HI>Knock them down, kill them, or hang 'em presently:</HI> Thus they were driven back, and forced into the City again, narrowly escaping with their Lives. But the Tumult did not yet cease; for some of the Multitude were heard to say, <HI>That they should find Protection from the Ma∣gistrates, than those Strangers,</HI> viz. <HI>Camm</HI> and <HI>Audland.</HI> But the Officers of the Garrison thinking it unwarrantable to permit such a Tumult, since it was not without Reason be fear'd, that the <HI>Royalists,</HI> or Abettors of King <HI>Charles,</HI> might take hold of such an Opportunity, and raise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Insur∣rection, caus'd three of the Ringleaders to be seiz'd: But this made such
<PB N="84" REF="003104_0095_0FEFF3E366C17A70"/>
a Stir, that the next Day more than five hundred People, as it was thought, were gather<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d together in a seditious Manner, so that their Companions were see at Liberty. This made the tumultuous Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more bold and saw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, the rather because they saw that the Magistrates, hearing that <HI>J. Camm</HI> and <HI>J. Audland</HI> not only had kept a Meeting at <HI>Brislington,</HI> but also had visited some in their Houses at <HI>Bristol,</HI> had bid them to depart the Town. Now the riotous Multitude did not stick to rush violently into the Houses of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so call'd, at <HI>Bristol,</HI> under a Pretence of preventing treasonable Plottings. And when some in Zeal told the Priests, <HI>These were the Fruits of their Doctrine,</HI> they incited the People the more, and induced the Magistrates to imprison some of those call'd <HI>Quakers.</HI> This instigated the Rabble to that De∣gree, that now they thought they had full Liberty to use all Kind of insolence against the said People; beating, smiting, pushing, and often treading upon them till Blood was shed; for they were become a Prey to every malapert Fellow, as a People that were without the Protection of the Law. This often caus'd a Tumult in the Town; and some said (not without good Reason) that the Apprentices durst not have left their Work, had not their Masters given them Leave. And a certain Person inform'd the Mayor and Aldermen upon his Oath, <HI>That he had heard an Apprentice say, that they had Leave from their Masters, and were encouraged;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alderman <HI>Hellier</HI> is said to encou∣rage the Mob.</NOTE> <HI>for Alderman</HI> George Hellier <HI>had said, He would dye rather than any of the Apprentices should go to Prison.</HI> Now an Order of Sessions came forth, <HI>That the Constables do once in every Fortnight, make diligent Search within their several Wards, for all Strangers and suspicious Persons: And that all People be forewarned not to be present at any Tumult, or other unlawful As∣sembly, or gather into Companies or Multitudes in the Streets, on Pain of being punished according to Law.</HI> But this Order was to little Purpose, for the tumultuous Companies and Riots continu'd; and when once a Pro∣clamation was read in the Name of the Lord Protector, requiring eve∣ry one to depart, some of the Rioters were heard to say <HI>What do you tell us of a Protector? Tell us of King</HI> Charles. In the mean while the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, were kept in Prison, and it plainly appear'd, that the Order against unlawful Assemblies was levell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d against their Meetings: And tho' the Magistrates pretended that they must answer for it to the Protector, if they did let the <HI>Quakers</HI> alone without disturbing their Meetings, which, at that Time, for the most Part, were silent, and no∣thing was spoken but when, now and then, one of their Ministers from abroad visited them; yet this was not at all agreeable with the <HI>Protector</HI>'s <HI>Speech</HI> he made on the 12th of the Month call'd <HI>September,</HI> to the Parliament in the painted Chamber, where he spoke these Words:</P>
<P><HI>IS not Liberty of Conscience in Religion a Fundamental?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Protect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s Speech for Li∣berty of Con∣science.</NOTE> So long as there is Liberty for the Supreme Magistrate, to exercise his Conscience in erecting what Form of Church-Government he is satisfied he should set up, why should he not give it to others? Liberty of Conscience is a Natural Right, and he that would have it, ought to give it, having Liberty to settle what he likes for the Publick. Indeed That hath been the Vanity of our Contests: Every Sect saith, Give me Liberty: But give it him, and to his Power he will not yield it to any Body else. Where is our Ingenuity? Truly that is a Thing that ought to be very reciprocal. The Migistrate hath his Supremacy, and he may settle Religion ac∣cording to his Conscience: And I may say it to you, I can say it: All the Mo∣ney in the Nation would not have tempted Men to fight upon such an Account as they have engaged, if they had not had Hopes of Liberty, better than they had from</HI> Epis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opacy, <HI>or than would have been afforded them from</HI> Scottish Pres∣bytery,
<PB N="85" REF="003104_0096_0FEFF3E5B8839720"/>
<HI>or an <HI>English</HI> either, if it had made such Steps, or been as sharp and rigid as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned when it was first set up. Thus I say is a Fundamental, it ought to be so: It is for us and the Generations to come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cromwel</HI> spoke more in Confirmation hereof; and indeed he would have been a brave Man, if really he had performed what here he asserted with binding Arguments. But tho' now he seemed to disapprove the Behaviour of <HI>Presbytery,</HI> (for then he was for <HI>Independen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y)</HI> yet after some Time he courted the <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> and these fawning upon him from the Pulpit, as their Preserver, and the Restorer of in Church, he suffered the <HI>Quakers</HI> to be persecuted under his Government, tho' he pretended not to know it, when he might easily have stopt it. But by hearkening to the Flatteries of the Clergy, at length he lost his Credit, even with those who with him had fought for the common Li∣berty; and thus at last befell him after his Death, what he seemed to have imprecated on himself in the foregoing Speech, if he departed from allowing due Liberty: For he farther said. <HI>That many of the People had been necessitated to go into the vast howling Wilderness in</HI> New-England, <HI>for the Enjoyment of their Liberty; and that Liberty was a Fundamental of the Government;</HI> adding, <HI>that it had cost much Blood to have it so, and even the hazarding of all.</HI> And in the Conclusion he said, <HI>That he could sooner be willing to be rolled into his Grave, and buried with Infamy, than give his Consent to the wilful throwing away of that Government, so testified unto in the Fundamentals of it.</HI> Now, who knows not what infamy befel him af∣terwards, when in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d. 'tis said, his Corps was digg'd up, and buried near the Gallows, as may be farther menti∣on'd in its due Place?</P>
<P>But I return now to <HI>Bristol,</HI> where several were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt in Prison still, and no Liberty granted them; nay, they were even charged with what they utterly denied themselves to be guilty of: Among these, one <HI>John Worring</HI> was accused of having called the Priest, <HI>Samuel Grimes, a Devil:</HI> But <HI>Worring</HI> denied this, tho' he did not stick to say, <HI>He could prove somewhat like it by his own Words.</HI> And it being ask'd him, <HI>How?</HI> He answer'd, That <HI>the Priest had said at the Meeting, that in all Things he did, be sinned; and if in all Things, then at well in his Preaching, as in other Things; and he that sinneth, is of the Devil. If you will not believe me, be∣lieve Scriptures.</HI> It may be easily conjectur'd, that this Answer did not please the Priest's Followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Worring. Eliz. Mar∣shall,</HI> and o∣thers impri∣son'd.</NOTE> and therefore <HI>Worring</HI> and some others were kept in Prison, and among these also <HI>Elizabeth Marshall,</HI> who in the Steeple-house, after the Priest <HI>John Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wls</HI> had dismis'd the People, with what is call'd the <HI>Blessing,</HI> spoke to him, and said, <HI>This is the Word of the Lord to thee: I warn thee to repent, and to mind the Light of Christ in thy Conscience.</HI> And when the People, by Order of the Rulers then present, violently assaulted her, giving her many Blows with Staves and, Cudgels, she cry'd out, <HI>The mighty Day of the Lord is at Hand, wherein he will strike Terror on the Wicked.</HI> Some Time before she spoke also in the Steeple-house, to the Priest <HI>Ralph Farmer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest <HI>Far∣mer.</HI></NOTE> after he had ended his Sermon and Prayer, and said, This is the Word of the Lord to thee. <HI>Woe, woe, woe, from the Lord to them who take the Word of the Lord in their Mouths, and the Lord never sent them.</HI></P>

<P>Hereunto these Magistrates affixed their Seals; and that Alderman <HI>Sherman</HI> might be sure his Name was down, he wrote it twice. How frivolous this Pretence of <HI>Persons of the</HI> Franciscan <HI>Order</HI> was, even a Child might perceive; for the <HI>Quakers</HI> were by this Time so multiplied in the North of <HI>England,</HI> that they could no more be lookt upon as an unknown People. And as for <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and <HI>James Naylor,</HI> they had not yet been at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and therefore it seemed absurd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eek for them there. But it was thought expedient to brand the <HI>Quakers</HI> with odious Names,
<PB N="87" REF="003104_0098_0FEFF3EA78BA27E0"/>
that so under the Cloak thereof, they might be persecuted as Disturbers of the publick Peace:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Robertson</HI> and <HI>J. Cole</HI> committed to <HI>Newgate</HI> in <HI>Bristol,</HI> for attempting to speak in a Steeple-house.</NOTE> As appeared when one <HI>Thomas Robertson,</HI> and <HI>Josiah Cole</HI> being at <HI>Nicholas</HI> Steeple-house, and standing both still, without speaking a Word, until the Priest <HI>Hazzard</HI> had ended, and dismist the People, were very rudely treated; for <HI>Thomas</HI> then lifting up his Voice, was presently, even when the Word was yet in his Mouth, struck on the Head by many, as was also his Companion, tho' he did not attempt to speak. But <HI>Thomas,</HI> after being a little recovered of a heavy Blow, began to speak again, and said to the People, <HI>Tremble before the Lord, and the Word of his Holiness.</HI> But this so kindled their Anger, that they were both hurried out of the Steeple-house, and with great Rage driven to the Mayor's,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Hignel</HI> brought from his Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p and sent to Prison without a Mittimus, for being <HI>Quaker.</HI></NOTE> who commanded them both to <HI>Newgate</HI>-Prison. Not long after one <HI>Jeremy Hignel,</HI> being in his Shop attending his Calling, was sent for by the Mayor and Aldermen, to come before them; which he pre∣sently doing, the Mayor asked him, <HI>Whether he knew where he was?</HI> He answered, <HI>He did.</HI> Then the Mayor asked, <HI>where?</HI> He replied, <HI>In the Presence of the Lord. Are you not,</HI> said the Mayor, <HI>in the Presence of the Lords Justices?</HI> His Answer was, <HI>If you be the Lord's Justices, I am.</HI> Where∣upon one of the Aldermen said, without any more Words passing at that Time, <HI>We see what he is; take him away to</HI> Newgate. For since he did not take off his Hat, it was concluded he was a <HI>Quaker,</HI> and this was counted Cause enough to send him to Prison; and so he was immediately brought thither, where the Keeper received him without a Mittimus, and kept him close Prisoner nineteen Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Wastfield</HI> in like Man∣ner kept close Prisoner thir∣ty three Days, and not suf∣fer'd to see his dying Child.</NOTE> permitting none to come to him but his Wife. No better was the Treatment ot <HI>Daniel Wastfield</HI> who be∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for by the Mayor, appeared before him, and Alderman <HI>Vickris;</HI> Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Mayor said to him, Wastfield, <HI>come hither;</HI> And he thereupon drawing near, the Mayor asked him three several Times, <HI>What art thou?</HI> tho' he knew him well enough, having called him by his Name, as a∣bovesaid. <HI>Wastfield</HI> answered, <HI>I am a Man. But what's thy Name? said the</HI> Mayor. <HI>My Name</HI> is Daniel Wastfield, answered he. Then said the Mayor to one of his Officers, <HI>Take him and carry him to</HI> Newgate; further adding, <HI>That he came thither to contemn Justice:</HI> To which <HI>Wastfield</HI> replied, <HI>No, I came hither in Obedience to thy Order;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mayor's Word a Mit∣timus.</NOTE> for the Mayor had sent for him, as hath been said. Thus he was carried away without a Mittimus, the Mayor saying, his Word was a <HI>Mittimus;</HI> and he was kept a close Prisoner thir∣ty three Days, and none suffered to come to him but his Servants, not∣withstanding he was a Widower, and must now leave his House and Trade to their Management; and a Child of his died in the mean While and was buried, and he kept from seeing it.</P>
<P>The Rulers thus having begun Persecution, became from Time to Time more vigorous in it, insomuch, that several others were imprison∣ed, and among these,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C. Birkhea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and others sent to Prison, chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er at the Instigation of Priest <HI>Far∣mer.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Christopher Birkhead,</HI> who standing still in <HI>Nicholas</HI> Steeple-house, with his Hat on, and being asked by the <HI>Priest</HI> Ralph Far∣mer, <HI>What be stood there for;</HI> answered, <HI>I stand in Obedience to the righteous Law of God in my Conscience: I have neither offended the Law of God, nor of the Nation. A wonderful and horrible Thing is committed in the Land.</HI> More he would have spoken, but was stopt with beating and thrusting, and so carried to Prison. Now the Magistrates were not a little incited to Persecution by the said <HI>Farmer;</HI> and there being several that were very bold, they did not stick to write sharp Letters to him; and his indecent Carriage was also told him to his Face by Word of Mouth in the Steeple-house af∣ter Sermon; and those who did so, were sent to Prison. At length these Prisoners were brought to Trial; and since it could not be proved that they had transgressed any Law, some of the Rulers seemed inclined to set them at Liberty, if they would have declared, That <HI>they were sorry for</HI>

<HI>what they had done.</HI> Among them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> one <HI>William Ford,</HI> and nothing material being found against him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he was one of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M.

Yet he was asked, <HI>Whether he was sorry for what he had done?</HI> Which denying, as well as those who had reproved the Priests, he that was not guilty was sent to Prison again, as well as those that were pretended to be so. A∣mong these last was also <HI>Sarah Goldsmith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Goldsmith.</NOTE> who from a well meant Zeal to test<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y against Pride, having a Coat of Sackcloth, and her Hair discheveled with Earth or Dust strewed on her Head, had gone through the City without receiving any considerable Harm from the People, because some lookt upon her to be crack-brain'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tem.

How long the others were kept in Prison, I dont know certainly; however, it was a pretty long Time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Doings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommitted to Writing.</NOTE> for <HI>George Bishop</HI> and <HI>Dennis Hollis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> who formerly had been a Member of the Parliament, and three others, put all these Transactions in Writing at large, and sent it to the Magistrates, in Hopes that thereby they might see the Evil of Persecution; but this proving in Vain, they gave it out in Print five Months after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And after∣wards print∣ed.</NOTE> that so every one might know how the <HI>Bristolers</HI> treated their Inhabitants, which was to that Degree; that Authors said, <HI>Was such a tyrannical Iniquity and Cruelty ever heard of in this Nation? or would the Ministers under King</HI> Charles <HI>have ventured to do so? Was not</HI> Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford <HI>but a mean Transgressor in Comparison of these?</HI> And tho' Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> was beheaded, yet it could not be proved that the Epis∣copalians had persecuted so fiercely, as these pretended Assertors of Liber∣ty of Conscience had done, who being got into Possession of the Power, did oppress more than those they had driven out. This made the Perse∣cuted, some of which formerly had also fought for the common Liberty, the more in Earn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t aginst those that were now in Authority.</P>
<P>But I'll turn away from <HI>Bristol</HI> towards <HI>Norwich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Norwich R. Hubber∣thorn.</HI> and <HI>G. White∣head</HI> there. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his last im∣prison'd.</NOTE> whither <HI>Richard Hub∣berthorn</HI> and <HI>George Whitehead</HI> were gone. Here it happened that <HI>R. Hubber∣thorn</HI> having spoken something to a Priest in a Steeple-house-yard, and not having taken off his Hat before the Magistrates, was imprisoned in the Castle, where he was kept great Part of the following Year, and in the mean while wrote several Epistles of Exhortation to his Friends; and the Preaching of him and his Companion <HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> had such Effect, that a Meeting of their Friends was settled in that City.</P>
<P>But before I go on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Charac∣ter.</NOTE> it will be convenient to give some Account of the Quality of these two Persons. <HI>R. Hubberthorn</HI> was born in the North of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and descended from very honest Parents: His Father was a Yeoman of good Reputation among Men; and <HI>Richard</HI> was his only Son, and from a Youth inclined to Piety. Being come to Man's Estate he be∣came an Officer in the Parliament's Army, and from a Zeal for Godliness, preach'd sometimes to his Soldiers. But entring afterwards into the Soci∣ety of the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called, he left his Millitary Employment, and testi∣fied publickly against it; for he was now become a Soldier under another

Banner, <HI>viz</HI> that of Christ Jesus, Prince of Peace; not sighting as for∣merly with the outward Sword, but with the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. In hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he had an excellent Gift, and tho' not so loud in Voice as some other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet he was a Man of a quick Understanding, and very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ying in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaching.</P>
<P><HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> who whilst I write this, is yet alive, was train'd up to Learning, and tho but a Youth, instructed others in Literat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and con∣tinued in that Calling sometime after he came to be convinced of that Truth which was preached by the Professors of the Light; and he strove to bring up Children in the Fear of the Lord. But before this Change, he was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hearer of the World's Teachers, and usually frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Steeple-house at <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton</HI> in <HI>Westmoreland:</HI> Yet the Singing of <HI>David</HI>'s Psalms became so burthensom to him, that sometimes he could not join therewith; for he saw that <HI>David</HI>'s Conditions were not generally sutable to the States of a mixt Multitude; and he found himself to be short of what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. This Consideration brought him into such a Strait, that often he durst not sing those Psalms the Priests gave their Hearers to sing, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he should have told Lies unto God. Now also he began to see that the Priests Lives and Practices did not agree with their Doctrine; for they themselves spoke against Pride and Covetousness, and yet lived in them. This likewise made him go to hear some that were separated from the National Church, and got into a more specious Form of Godli∣ness: But he soon saw, that tho there was a Difference in the Ceremonial Part, and that these had a more true Form of Words than the Priests, yet they were such as ran before they were sent by God, speaking Peace to that Nature in him, wherein he felt no true Peace. And when he was about seventeen Years of Age, which was in the Year 1652, he first heard the Doctrine of Truth preach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by those that were reproachfully called <HI>Quakers;</HI> and their Testimony wrought so powerfully on his Mind, that he received it, and so enter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d into their Communion. Now he found that to grow up in the true Wisdom, and to become Wise in the living Knowledge of God, he must become a Fool to that Wisdom, wherein he had been feeding upon the Tree of Knowledge, having in that State no Right to the Tree of Life: And he continuing in Faithfulness, it plea∣sed the Lord to ordain him a Minister of the Gospel; in which Service he acquitted himself well, to the convincing of others, and the Edification of the Church.</P>
<P>But now leaving him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel Usage of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liz. Hea∣vens</HI> and <HI>Eliz. Fletcher</HI> at <HI>Oxford.</HI></NOTE> let's go and see what happened at <HI>Oxford</HI> in the Year 1654. At the latter End of the Month called <HI>June,</HI> there came two Women, named <HI>Elizabeth Heavens,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth Fletcher:</HI> These spoke in the Streets, to the People, and in the Colledge they exhorted the Scholars, who wickedly requiting their Zeal, violently pusht <HI>Elizabeth Fletcher</HI> a∣gainst a Grave-Stone, and then threw her into the Grave; and their Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> grew to that Pitch, that they tyed these two Women together, and drove them under the Pump; and after their being exceedingly wetted with pumping Water upon them, they threw them into a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Ditch, thro' which they dragged <HI>Elizabeth Fletcher,</HI> who was a young Woman; and so cruelly abused her, that she was in a painful Condition till her Death, which fell out not long after. Some short Time after this rude Encounter, she and her Companion, on a First-Day of the Week, went into the Stee∣ple-house at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and when the Priest had ended, they began to ad∣monish the People to Godliness: But two Justices there present, com∣manded them to be taken into Custody, and carried to the Prison call'd <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ardo,</HI> where none but Felons were used to be lodged. The Justices desiring the Magistrates to meet on this Account, the Mayor would not meddle with it; but said, <HI>Let those who have committed them, deal with

Well,</HI> said the Vice-Chancellor, <HI>you profane the Word of God, and I fear you know not God, tho you so much speak of him.</HI> Then the Women being made to withdraw, it was concluded that there was Matter enough for their Commitment and Punishment, and agreed that a Paper should be drawn up for their being whipped out of the City. When this was done, it was presented to the Mayor to set his Hand to it, but he refused, and said, <HI>He was not willing to do so.</HI> Then one of the Justices said, <Q>That it was the Priviledge of the City, that it any vag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant was taken within the Franchises and Liberties thereof, a Paper must be drawn up, that such a one, Mayor, had committed such and such Per∣sons; and that then it was to be sealed with the Office-Seal.</Q> But the Mayor refused this as well as the other. Which made some say, <HI>That if he would not, it should be done by them.</HI> And then it was agreed upon, <HI>That they should be whipped soundly;</HI> which was also performed the next Morning, tho' with much Unwillingness in the Executioner; and the Mayor had no Hand in it.</P>
<P>But leaving these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbara Blaugdon.</NOTE> I'll turn to another, one <HI>Barbara Blaugdon,</HI> of whom Mention hath already been made, that she was one of those that received the Truth by the Ministry of <HI>John Audland</HI> and <HI>John Camm.</HI> She was from her Youth inclined to Godliness, and her Employment was to in∣struct Children. But being enter'd into the Society of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> she became plain, both in Speech and Habit, and thereupon the Children she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aught, were taken from her; and going sometimes into Steeple-houses to bear Testimony against their Formalities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imprison'd at <HI>Bristol.</HI></NOTE> she was put in Prison, and kept there a Quarter of a Year at a Time.

Then <HI>Barbara</HI> went to <HI>Great-Torrington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Great-Torrington,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Priest's Importunity the Mayor sends her 20 Miles to <HI>Exe∣ter.</HI></NOTE> and going into the Steeple-house, spoke somewhat to the People by Way of Exhortation; but not having sufficient Oppor∣tunity to clear herself, went to her Lodging, and sat to writing.

To which she answered, <HI>That they would not suffer her to speak there, and that she knew no Law that could compel her to go thither twice in a Day; and that they all knew she was there in the Morning.</HI> Being thus unwilling to go, the next Day the Mayor sent for her; when come, she found him Moderate, and loth to send her to Prison: But the Priest being present, was very eager, and said, <HI>She ought to be whipt for a Vagabond.</HI> She then bid him <HI>prove where ever she askt any one for a Bit of Bread:</HI> But he said, <HI>She had broken the Law by speaking in their Church:</HI> And he so prest the Mayor, that at length he made him write a <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and send her to <HI>Exeter</HI> Prison, which was twenty Miles distant: There she remained for some Time, until the Assizes came, but was not brought forth to a Tryal. And after the Sessions were over, she was put to lodge one Night among a great Company of Gypsies, that were there in Prison; and the next Day the Sheriff came with a Beadle, who brought her into a Room, where he whipt her till the Blood ran down her Back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is there cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣elly whipt.</NOTE> and she never startled at a Blow; but sang aloud, and was made to rejoyce that she was counted worthy to suffer for the Name of the Lord; which made the Beadle say, <HI>Do ye sing?

Next Day she was brought before the Mayor, who discoursing much with her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And courte∣ously treated by the Mayor.</NOTE> had a Sence of what she spoke to him; and at last he set open two Doors, one right against the other, and said, <HI>He would give her her Choice, which she would go out at; whether she would go forth to Prison again, or go home.</HI> And she told him, <HI>that she would choose Liberty rather than Bonds.</HI> So she went homeward, and then he took his Horse and follow∣ed; and overtaking her, would have had her ride behind him,; but when any whom he knew, met them, he would slacken his Pace; and as soon as they were past, he came up again to her; which she perceiving, refused to ride behind him; yet he rode three or four Miles with her, and discoursed all the Way: And when they parted, she kneeled down and prayed for him, all which Time he was very serious, and afterwards
<PB N="92" REF="003104_0103_0FEFF3F137408FD0"/>grew very solid and sober: She writ once to him; but not long after, he dyed.</P>
<P>Being now come home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Basing-Stoke</HI> pro∣cures Liberty for two Friends.</NOTE> she was moved to go to <HI>Basing-Stoke</HI> to endea∣vour to obtain Liberty for two of her Friends, viz. <HI>Thomas Robinson</HI> and <HI>Ambrose Rigg,</HI> who were taken up at the first Meeting that their Friends had had there. But when she came thither, the Entrance of the Prison was denied her. And she having a Letter from <HI>John Camm</HI> to them, put it in at the Chink of the Door, and then she went to the Mayor to de∣sire their Liberty; He told her, <HI>That if he saw the Letter which she brought them, they should have their Liberty.</HI> She then said, <HI>He should see it;</HI> and so went and fetcht it; which he having read, told her, <HI>That she should have her Brethren out; but that he could not let them out presently.</HI> Yet it was not long before her Friends had their Liberty.</P>

<P>But I return to <HI>Myles Halhead,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.

<P>Being thus safely past the Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Visit <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI> and <HI>Leith,</HI></NOTE> they went to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and <HI>Leith,</HI> where they staid about ten Days.

to <HI>England.</HI> But before I leave <HI>Scotland,</HI> I may say, that as the first Meetings were kept at <HI>Drumbowy</HI> and <HI>Heads,</HI> so it was not long ere Meetings were settled also at <HI>Garshore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meetings set∣tled at <HI>Gar∣shore, Edin∣burgh,</HI> and <HI>Aberdeen.</HI></NOTE> at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and also at <HI>A∣berdeen.</HI> The first <HI>Scotch</HI> Preachers or those call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> I find to have been <HI>William Osburn, Richard R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Hamilton</HI> already men∣tion'd. Of the said <HI>Hamilton,</HI> I may mention a singular Instance. Af∣ter he and his Wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Preachers in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> with her and his Sister, had separated themselves from the Society of the <HI>Independents,</HI> it happen'd that <HI>Thomas Charters,</HI> a Teacher of that Sect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka∣ble Occur∣rence.</NOTE> at <HI>Kilbride,</HI> not far from <HI>Drumbowy,</HI> seeing that he could not draw <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and those of his Family back again, threat∣ned them with Excommunication, and appointed a Day for it, giving Notice thereof to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> some Days beforehand. <HI>Hamilton</HI> warned him to forbear, or else the Anger of God would seize on him. But he answered, <HI>It is but</HI> Alexander Hamilton <HI>that saith so.</HI> To which <HI>Hamilton</HI> return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Presence of many Witnesses, <HI>That it was not only he, but what he had said was of the Lord.</HI> But <HI>Charters</HI> persisting in what he intend∣ed, and walking two Days before the appointed Time in the Steeple-house-yard, where his Horse was feeding, stept to him to stroke him; but the Horse growing wanton, gave <HI>Charters</HI> such a violent Kick on his Side, that he dy'd about the same Hour which was appointed by him for the Excommunication. Whether this Case happen'd in the Year I now describe, I am not certain; but however, it was either in, or near it.</P>
<P>This Year <HI>Myles</HI> came to <HI>Berwick</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.

Whereupon the Recorder said, <HI>Sirs, As I understand by his own Words, if he cannot prove the Mayor of this Town a Persecutor, in my Judg∣ment he hath wrong'd him.</HI> To this <HI>Myles</HI> answered, <HI>If the Mayor of this Town of</HI> Berwick, <HI>dare say in the Presence of the Lord, whose Presence is here, that he is no Persecutor, but the persecuting Nature is slain in him, I will be willing to abide the Judgment of the Court.</HI> Then the Clerk of the Court said, <HI>Mr.</HI> Mayor, <HI>If you will say that you are no Persecutor, but the persecuting Nature is slain in you, he is willing to abide the Judgment of the Court.</HI> To this the Mayor answer'd, <HI>I know not what to do; I would I had never seen him: I pray you, let him go, and let us be no more troubled with him.</HI> Then <HI>Myles</HI> said, "That he would prove this Mayor of <HI>Berwick</HI> the greatest Persecutor in Town or Country." <HI>I was once</HI> (thus he went on) <HI>committed to Prison in this Town before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">for speaking the Word of the Lord in the Streets.</NOTE> by some of the Justices that are now in this Court; but thou, O Man, hast exceeded them all; then hast committed me, and kept me in close Prison for about ten Weeks, for speaking to thy own Person in thy own Shop. Now I make my Appeal to the Recorder of this Town of</HI> Berwick, <HI>as I am a free-born</HI> En∣glishman, <HI>whether my Imprisonment be Legal, according to the Law of this Nation, or not?</HI> Then the Recorder of the Town stood up, and said, <HI>It is not very Legal for any Minister of the Law, to imprison any Man in his own Cause.</HI> Then the Court cry'd, <HI>Take him away.</HI> The Chief Priest

of the Town then stood up, and desired the Court that he might ask <HI>Myles</HI> one Question?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another re∣markable Matter.</NOTE> To this <HI>Myles</HI> said, <HI>The Lord knows thy Heart, O Man, and at this present has revealed thy Thoughts to his Servant; and therefore now I know thy Heart also, thou High-Priest, and the Question thou wouldst ask me: And if thou wilt promise me before the Court, that if I tell thee the Question thou wouldst ask me, thou wilt deal plainly with me, I will not only tell thee thy Query, but I will answer it.</HI> Then the Priest said, <HI>He would:</HI> Then <HI>Myles</HI> pro∣ceeded, <HI>Thy Question is this; Thou wouldst know whether I own that Christ that died at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>or not?</HI> To this the Priest, wondering, said, <HI>Truly, that is the Question.</HI> Then <HI>Myles</HI> said, <HI>According to my Promise, I will answer it before this Court. In the Presence of the Lord God of Heaven, I own no other Christ than Him that died at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and made a good Confession before</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>to be the Light and Way that leads fallen Man out of Sin and Evil, up to God Eternal, blessed for evermore.</HI> More Questions were not asked him, but the Jailor was commanded to take him away.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is releas'd.</NOTE> Yet within a short Time the Court gave Order to release him. Then going to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> he returned to his Wife and Chil∣dren at <HI>Mount-joy,</HI> where we will leave him for some Time, and in the mean While return again to <HI>G.

To relate all his Occurrences there, would be beyond my Pale.</P>
<P>Passing then thro' the Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to <HI>Lin∣colnshire.</HI></NOTE> he went to <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and to the Meeting where he was, came the Sheriff of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> who made great Contention for a Time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sheriff convinced.</NOTE> but at length the Power of the Lord so reach'd him, that he was convinced of the Truth, as were several others also that did oppose.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was in this Country, the Church of his Friends in∣creased, and many received the Doctrine preached by him, and amongst these was one Sir <HI>Richard Wrey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Also Sir <HI>R.

<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> now went to <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> and the abovesaid Sheriff of <HI>Lincoln</HI> travelling with him, they came into <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI> and so into the <HI>Peak</HI>-Country, where having a Meeting at <HI>Thomas Hammersly</HI>'s, several <HI>Ranters</HI> came and opposed him; and when he reproved them for Swear∣ing, they said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the <HI>Peak</HI>-Country is op∣posed by <HI>Ran∣ters.</HI></NOTE> Abraham, Jacob, <HI>and</HI> Joseph <HI>swore.</HI> But tho' <HI>G. Fox</HI> did not deny this, yet he said, <HI>Christ,</HI> (<HI>who said, Before</HI> Abraham <HI>was,</HI> I am,) Swear not at all. <HI>And Christ ends the Prophets, as also the old Priest∣hood, and the Dispensation of</HI> Moses; <HI>and he reigns over the House of</HI> Jacob, <HI>and of</HI> Joseph, <HI>and saith,</HI> Swear not at all. <HI>And God when he bringeth in the First-begotten into the World, saith,</HI> Let all the Angels of God worship him, <HI>to wit,</HI> Christ Jesus, <HI>who saith,</HI> Swear not at all. <HI>And as for the Plea that Men make for Swearing to end their Strife,</HI> Christ, <HI>who says,</HI> Swear not at all, <HI>destroys the Devil and his Works, who is the Author of Strife; for that is one of his Works. And God said,</HI> This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. <HI>So the Son is to be heard, who forbids Swearing: And the Apostle</HI> James, <HI>who did hear the Son of God, and followed him, and preached him, forbids also all Oaths.</HI> Thus <HI>G.

G. Fox</HI> travelling on, came to <HI>Swanington</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> where there was a General Meeting, to which many of his Friends came from seve∣ral Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general Meeting at <HI>Swanington.</HI></NOTE> and among these, <HI>J.

<P>Then he went to <HI>Drayton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> at <HI>Drayton</HI> his Birth-Place; has a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Priest <HI>Stephens</HI> &amp;c. before many People.</NOTE> his Birth-place, to visit his Relations; where <HI>Nathaniel Stephens</HI> the Priest, having gotten another Priest, sent for him. <HI>G. Fox</HI> having been three Years abroad, knew nothing of their Design, but yet at last he went to the Steeple-house-yard, where the two Priests had gather'd Abundance of People; and they would have had him gone into the Steeple-house: But he asked them, <HI>What he should do there?</HI> And it was answer'd him, <HI>Mr.</HI> Stephens <HI>could not bear the Cold.</HI> At which <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>He may bear it as well as I.</HI> At last they went into a great Hall, <HI>R. Farnsworth</HI> being with him, where they enter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d into a Dispute with the Priests, concerning their Practice, how contrary it was to Christ and his Apostles. The Priests asked, <HI>Where Tythes were forbid∣den, or ended?</HI> Whereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> shewed them out of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Chap. vii. <Q>That not only Tythes, but the Priesthood, that took Tythes, was ended; and that the Law was ended and disanul∣led, by which the Priesthood was made, and Tythes were command∣ed to be paid.</Q> Moreover, he knowing <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Condition, laid open his Manner of Preaching, shewing, <Q>That he, like the rest of the Priests, did apply the Promises to the first Birth, which must die; whereas the Promises were to the Seed, not to many Seeds, but to the one Seed, Christ, who was one in Male and Female: For all were to be born again, before they could enter into the Kingdom of God.</Q> Then <HI>Stephens</HI> said, <HI>That he must not judge so.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>He that was spiritual, judged all Things. Stephens</HI> confessed, <HI>That this was a full Scripture: But Neighbours,</HI> said he, <HI>this is the Business;</HI> G. Fox <HI>is come to the Light of the Sun, and now he thinks to put out my Star-Light.</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> return'd, <HI>That he would not quench the least Measure of God in any, much less put out his Star-Light, if it were true Star-Light, Light from the Morning-Star: But that, if he had any Thing from Christ, or God, he ought to speak it freely, and not take Tythes from the People for Preaching; seeing Christ commanded his Ministers to give freely, as they had received freely.</HI> But <HI>Stephens</HI> said, <HI>He would not yield to that.</HI> This Dispute being broke off for that Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dispute resum'd by eight Priests.</NOTE> was ta∣ken up again, a Week after by eight Priests, in the Presence of many People: And when they saw that <HI>G. Fox</HI> remain'd unshaken, they fawningly said, <HI>What might he have been, if it had not been for the</HI> Quakers! Afterwards the Dispute was resumed in the Steeple-house-yard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And after∣wards a third Time in the Steeple-house-Yard.</NOTE> where <HI>G. Fox</HI> shew'd, by Abundance of Scriptures, that they who preached for Wages, were false Prophets, and Hirelings; and that such who would not preach without Wages, or Tythes, did not serve the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Bellies. This he treated on so largely, that a Professor said, George, <HI>What! wilt thou never have done?</HI> To this his Answer was, <HI>That he should have done shortly.</HI> And when he broke off, one of the Priests said, <HI>They would read the Scriptures he had quoted. With all my Heart,</HI> said he: <HI>Then they began to read</HI> Jer. xxiii. and when they had read a Verse or two, <HI>George</HI> said, <HI>Take Notice, People.</HI> But the Priests cry'd, <HI>Hold thy Tongue,</HI> George. He then bid them <HI>read the whole Chapter throughout:</HI> But they stopping, ask'd him a Que∣stion: And he told them, <HI>That if the Mattar he charged them with, was first granted, then he would answer their Question;</HI> for his Charge had been,
<PB N="96" REF="003104_0107_0FEFF3F63A09D960"/>
That <HI>they were false Prophets, and false Teachers,</HI> such as the true Pro∣phets, Christ, and his Apostles cried against. <HI>Nay,</HI> said a Professor to That: But he said, <HI>Yes; for you leaving the Matter, and going to another thing, seem to consent to the Proof of the former Charge.</HI> Now, their Que∣stion was, <HI>Seeing those false Prophets were adulterated, whether he did judge Priest</HI> Stephens <HI>an Adulterer.</HI> To this he answer'd, <HI>That he was adulterated from God in his Practice, like those false Prophets.</HI> Then they broke up the Meeting, and <HI>Stephens</HI> desir'd, that <HI>G. Fox,</HI> with his Father and Mother, might go aside with him, that he might speak to him in private. <HI>George,</HI> tho' his Relations yielded to it, was very loth to do so; yet that it might not be said he was disobedient to his Parents, he went: But many of the People being willing to hear, drew close to them. Then <HI>Stephens</HI> said, <HI>If he was out of the Way,</HI> George <HI>should pray for him; and if</HI> George <HI>was out of the Way, he would pray for him:</HI> Moreover, <HI>That he would give to</HI> George <HI>a Form of Words to pray by.</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> replied, <HI>It seems thou dost not know, whether thou art in the right Way, or no; but I know, that I am in the everlasting Way, Christ Jesus, which thou art out of: And thou wouldst give me a Form of Words to pray by, and yet thou deniest the</HI> Common Prayer-Book <HI>to pray by, as well as I. If thou wouldst have me pray for thee by a Form of Words, is not this to deny the Apostles Doctrine and Practice of praying by the Spirit, as it gave Words and Ʋtterance?</HI> Here, tho' some of the People fell a laughing, yet others that were grave and sober, were convinc'd of the Truth, and the Priests were greatly shaken; insomuch, that <HI>George</HI>'s Father, tho' he was a Hearer and Follower of the Priest, was so well satisfied, that, striking his Cane upon the Ground, he said, <HI>Truly I see, he that will but stand to the Truth, it will carry him out.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>G.

Here he enter'd into a long Dis∣course with them, about the Priests, and about Meetings; for at this Time there was a Noise of a Plot against <HI>Cromwel:</HI> And he spoke also much concerning the <HI>Light of Christ,</HI> which enlighteneth every Man, that cometh into the World. The Colonel hearing him speak thus, asked, <HI>Whether it was the Light of Christ that made</HI> Judas <HI>betray his Master, and afterwards led him to hang himself? G.

G. Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>For what? What have I done, or whom have I wronged from a Child? And who can accuse me of any Evil?</HI> Then the Colonel asked him, <HI>If he would go home, and stay there.</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> answered, <HI>That if he should promise him so, it would imply, that he was guilty of something to go home, and make his Home a Prison to himself: And if he went to Meetings, they would say, he broke their Order. But that he should go to Meetings, as the Lord should order him; and that therefore he could not submit to their Requirings:</HI> And having farther added, <HI>That he and his Friends were a peaceable People:</HI> The Colonel said, <HI>Well then, I will send you to morrow Morning by Six a-clock to my Lord</HI> Protector, <HI>by Captain</HI> Drury, <HI>one of his Life-Guard.</HI> The next Morning, about the appointed Time, he was delivered to Captain <HI>Drury.</HI> Then <HI>G.

Fox</HI> then having left Col. <HI>Hacker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who sends him Prisoner by Capt. <HI>Dru∣ry</HI> to the Pro∣tector at <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE> was carried Prisoner by Captain <HI>Drury</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> where the Captain went to give the Protector an Ac∣count of him; and coming again, he told <HI>G. Fox, The</HI> Protector <HI>did require, that he should promise, not to take up a carnal Sword or Weapon against him, or the Government, as it then was; and that he should write this in what Words he saw good, and set his Hand to it. G. Fox</HI> considering this, next Morning wrote a Paper to the Protector, by the Name of <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> wherein he did in the Presence of God, declare, <Q>That he denied the wearing or drawing of a carnal Sword, or any outward Weapon, against him, or any Man: And that he was sent of God to stand a Witness against all Violence, and against the Works of Darkness; and to turn People from Darkness to the Light, and to bring them from the Occasion of War and Fighting, to the peaceable Gospel; and from being Evil-doers which the Magistrate's Sword should be a Terror to.</Q> Having written this, he set his Name to it, and gave it to Captain <HI>Drury,</HI> who delivered it to <HI>O. Cromwel;</HI> And after some Time, returning to the Maremaid, near <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> where <HI>G. Fox</HI> was lodged, he carried him to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and brought him before the Protector, who was not yet dressed, it being pretty early in the Morning. <HI>G. Fox</HI> coming in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With whom he has a long Conference.</NOTE> said, <HI>Peace be in this House,</HI> and bid the Protector, <HI>Keep in the Fear of God, that he might receive Wis∣dom from him; that by it he might be ordered, and with it might order all Things under his Hands to God's Glory.</HI> He had also much Discourse with him concerning Religion, wherein <HI>Cromwel</HI> carried himself very moderately, but said, that <HI>G. Fox and his Friends, quarrelled with the Ministers,</HI> meaning his Teachers. <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>He did not quarrel with them; but they qua∣relled with him, and his Friends. But,</HI> thus (continued he) <HI>if we own the Pro∣phets, Christ, and the Apostles, we cannot uphold such Teachers, Prophets, and Shepherds, as the Prophets, Christ, and the Apostles declared against; but we must declare against them by the same Power and Spirit.</HI> Moreover, he shewed, <HI>That the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles Preached freely, and declared against them that did not declare freely, but preached for filthy Lucre, and divined for Money, or preached for Hire, being covetous and greedy, like the dumb Dogs, that could never have enough: And that they that had the same Spirit, which Christ, the Prophets, and the Apostles had, could not but declare against all such now, as they did then.</HI> He also said, <HI>That all Christendom</HI> (so called) <HI>had the Scriptures, but they wanted the Power and Spirit, which they had who gave them forth; and that was the Reason, they were not in Fellowship with the Son, nor with the Father, nor with the Scriptures, nor one with another.</HI> Whilst he was thus speaking, <HI>Cromwel</HI> several Times said, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was very good, and it was Truth. G. Fox</HI> had many more Words with him; but seeing People come in, he drew a little back: And as he was turning, <HI>Cromwel</HI> catch'd him by the Hand, and with Tears in his Eyes, said, <HI>Come again to my House; for if thou and I were but an Hour of a Day together, we should be nearer one to another; adding, that he wisht him no more Ill, than he did to

his own Soul.</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> returned, <HI>That if he did, he wronged his own Soul;</HI> and bid him, <HI>Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en to God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that he might stand in his Counsel, and obey it; and if he did so, that would keep him from Hardness of Heart;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with much Tender∣ness is dis∣charged.</NOTE> but if he did not hear God's Voice, his Heart would be hardened.</HI> This so reached the Protector, that he said, <HI>It was true.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> went out; and Captain <HI>Drury</HI> following, told him, <HI>That the Lord Protector said, He was at Liberty, and might go whither he would.</HI> Yet he was brought into a great Hall, where the Protector's Gentlemen were to dine: And he asked, <HI>What they did bring him thither for?</HI> They told him, <HI>It was by the Protector's Order, that he might dine with them.</HI> But <HI>George</HI> bid them tell the Protector, <HI>He would not eat a Bit of his Bread, nor drink a Sup of his Drink.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But refuses his Entertain∣ment.</NOTE> When <HI>Cromwel</HI> heard this, he said, <HI>Now I see there's a People risen, and come up, that I cannot win either with Gifts, Honours, Offices, or Places; but all other Sects and People, I can.</HI> But it was told him again, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>had forsook their own, and were not like to look for such Things from him.</HI></P>
<P>It was very remarkable, that Captain <HI>Drury,</HI> who, while <HI>G.

But he felt the Power of the Lord was upon him, and he tumbled off his Bed, and cried to the Lord, and said, He would never speak against the</HI> Quakers <HI>more,</HI> viz. <HI>such as trembled at the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>The particular Occurrences that befel <HI>G. Fox,</HI> when he was at Liberty in <HI>London,</HI> I pass by. He had great Meetings there, and the Throngs of People were such, that he could hardly get to and from the Meetings, because of the Croud. In the mean while the Number of his Friends increased exceedingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> writes against Pride, gawdy Appa∣rel, and Fa∣shions.</NOTE> and some belonging to <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Court were also convinced of the Truth preached by him. He wrote about that Time several Papers, one of which was against Pride, gawdy Apparel, and the World's Fashions.</P>
<P>I don't find, that about this Time there was at <HI>London</HI> any Persecu∣tion from the Magistrates, but in other Places there was: And it was in this Year that <HI>Anne,</HI> the Wife of <HI>John Audland,</HI> coming into a Steeple-house at <HI>Banbury</HI> said, after the Priest had ended, <HI>That those that were without the Doctrine of Christ, tho' they said,</HI> the Lord liveth, <HI>yet spoke falsely, ac∣cording to</HI> Jer. v. 2. Because of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne Aud∣land <HI>impri∣son'd.</HI></NOTE> she was imprison'd, as guilty of Blasphemy, and two Boys swore against her, that she had said, <HI>That the Lord did not live.</HI> Thus false Accusations prevail'd, and at this Rate Persecution was cloak'd.</P>
<P>The Year drew now to an End,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Trans∣actions.</NOTE> and <HI>Cromwel</HI> concluded a Peace with the united <HI>Netherlands;</HI> to get Things the more clear at home, it seems he endeavour'd to remove Troubles abroad. And there being a Rumor spread of a Plot, as hath been hinted already, to be the more assured of the Parliament, he caus'd a Guard to be set upon the Door of the House, to keep out those Members that refused to sign a Paper, where∣by they promised, <Q>To be faithful to the Lord Protector, and to make no Alteration in the Government, so as it was settled, on a sin∣gle Person, and a Parliament.</Q> But several of the Members would not sign this Paper, Saying, that it was a Violation of the Privileges of the Parliament, and a depriving them of their Liberty; and therefore they were kept out; but others who subscribed the said Paper, were

admitted. Yet this Assembly not acting to the Satisfaction of <HI>Crom∣wel,</HI> he dissolved them after a Session of five Months.</P>
<P>The young King <HI>Charles,</HI> who lived in Exile, had left <HI>France,</HI> and was come to <HI>Cologn</HI> on the <HI>Rome,</HI> where he stay'd for some Time.

Whilst <HI>G.

<P>It hath been said already, that he was one of the Family of Judge <HI>Fell:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Caton</HI> at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Compa∣nion to Judge <HI>Fell's</HI> Son.</NOTE> For when he was but about fourteen Years of Age, his Father pro∣cur'd Leave for him to dwell in the said Family; and his Behaviour was so pleasing, that he was allowed the Judge's Son as a Companion Night and Day; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at as he did, and went with him a Hunting, Shoot∣ing, and Fishing, partaking of the same Pleasure with him in every Thing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving in Ease and Plenty; so that he had Cause of Joy, that Providence had cast his Lot into such a noted Family; for not only Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> but also his Wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> and their Daughters, were well qua∣lified. <HI>W. Caton</HI> conversing with such choice Company, grew up in Pie∣ty, and was very Zealous in the performing of his private Devotions, stay∣ing often in the Bed-chamber, till the Judge's Son, his Bed-fellow, was gone down, that so he might the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eely in Prayer pour out his Heart before God. And having attained to the Age of fifteen Years, he was very diligent, when he had been at a Lecture, to write down the chief Heads thereof; for such of the Family that could make Repetitions of Sermons, and paraphrase thereupon, were held in Esteem. But <HI>W. Caton</HI> found that what he reaped thereby could not satisfy the Hunger and Thirst of his immortal Soul.</P>
<P>After he, and the Judge's Son, had for some Time learned <HI>Latin</HI> toge∣ther in the Family, where there was a Priest that instructed them, they were removed to a School at <HI>Hauxhead:</HI> But here he found Company which he disliked more than that in the Judge's Family.</P>
<P>It was in the Year 1652, about Mid-summer, that <HI>G. Fox,</HI> (as hath been said in its proper Place) first came to the House of Judge <HI>Fell</HI> at <HI>Swarthmore.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonders at <HI>G.

Caton,</HI> that in due Time he began to be subject to this inward Convincement, by which he came to be much restrained in his Carriage, and could not allow himself so great Liberty as he was won<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to do; for tho' he was no Ways extravagant, yet now he saw that a true Christian must be wean∣ed from all Vanity; and that the common Diversions of Youth displeased God. This he clearly perceiv'd, for the Witnes of God had awakened and reproved him of that which was contrary to true Gravity, and So∣briety of Mind. He had not yet left the School: But (tho' he was pretty
<PB N="100" REF="003104_0111_0FEFF3FB430A9C38"/>
much advanc'd in his Learning) the making of <HI>Latin</HI> Verses became a Burthen to him, because he could not give his Thoughts that Liberty for Invention a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers did; neither could he well any longer give to the Master of the School the Compliment of the Hat, as he was used to do: This I had from his own Mouth. One may easily guess that hereby he was brought into a Streight: But <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> seeing that he long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to be freed from the School, caus'd him to stay at home, where he was em∣ploy'd by h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Writing, and teaching her Children. And when he was about seventeen Years of Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">About 17, is more strength∣ened for Spiri∣tual Warfare; visits Places of publick Worship and Markets, where he warns to re∣pent; but is buffeted and beaten.</NOTE> he became more and more strengthen∣ed in the spiritual Warfare, and his Heart was fill'd with Joy, because of the Mercy and Loving Kindness of the Lord to him. Thus advan∣cing in Godliness, he was frequently moved to go to the Places of pub∣lick Worship, and also to Markets, to warn People to Repentance; but then beating and buffeting was his Share, and because of his Youth he was despised by many; yet he fainted not: And esteeming it his Duty now to labour in the Ministry of the Gospel, he desir'd to be discharg'd of his Service. Judge <HI>Fell</HI> was very unwilling to part with him; but <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife, tho' she could not well give him up before, yet be∣lieving that the Lord required his Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And entring on the Mini∣stry, leaves Judge <HI>Fell's</HI> Family, tho' not willing to part with him.

<P>About the End of the Year 1654, being eighteen Years of Age, he took his Leave of that Family, which was not done without mutual shedding of Tears at parting. He then went to visit his Friends in <HI>Lan∣cashire, Yorkshire, Darbyshire,</HI> and <HI>Warwickshire;</HI> from thence to <HI>Norwich</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and so to <HI>Willingborough</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> where he found an Opportunity to declare the Truth of God in the Steeple-house. Af∣ter that, he travelled to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> visiting his Friends there; and then returned to <HI>Norwich,</HI> where he visited his Friends in Prison, and had great Meetings in that City. Then he went to <HI>London,</HI> where he was very kindly received by those of the Houshold of Faith. And on a First-Day of the Week was at two Steeple-houses, at one of which he had large Liberty to speak, being indeed perswasive in Speech; and in the Afternoon at a Meeting of <HI>Dissenters</HI> from the publick Worship, he had Liberty to speak, and to publish Truth without Opposition or Con∣tradiction from any; and many were added to the Faith: For at that Time there were Twelve ministring Brethren, most of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of the North of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Travels with <HI>J.

became so affected with <HI>W. Caton</HI>'s Testimony, that he invited him and <HI>J. Stubs</HI> to his House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">who then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with them in Pro∣fess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and lets his House be their Meet∣ing-Place.</NOTE> where he entertain'd them; and not long after they had a Meeting there; and he heard the Testimony of his Guests with no less Satisfaction than <HI>Agrippa</HI> of old did the Speech of the Apo∣stle <HI>Paul,</HI> when he said to him, <HI>Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian:</HI> For <HI>Luke Howard</HI> was not yet come so far, that he could resolve to con∣form himself with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so call'd; but yet, such was his Love to them, that when the Mayor of the Town sent four Constables to his House, with an Order to deliver them up, that so they might be carried out of the Town, he refused to do so, relying on his Right as a Freeman of the Corporation; and the Doors being shut, kept the Constables out of his House, and told them from the Shop-Win∣dow, that the Mayor had no Lawful Authority to have these Men ha∣led out of his House, and sent out of the Town; there being no Hue-and-Cry come after them. They staid yet some Days in his House, and he became so strengthened by their Ministry, that he joined with them in Profession, and also gave up his House to be a Meeting-place for their Friends.</P>
<P>Then <HI>W. Caton</HI> and <HI>J. Stubs</HI> departed the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From <HI>Dover</HI> they proceed to <HI>Foulstone, Hide, Rum∣ney</HI> &amp; <HI>Lidd.</HI> Here by their Ministry, and that of <HI>A.

<P>After some Stay they went to <HI>Rumney,</HI> and also to <HI>Lidd.</HI> Here it was that <HI>Samuel Fisher,</HI> both by their Ministry, and by that of <HI>Ambrose Rigg,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Robinson,</HI> (who also now were gone forth in the Service of the Gospel) was convinced, and brought over to their Society. He was one trained up to Literature, and had studied diligently in the Uni∣versity; and tho' he was but young then, yet of a pious Conversation, disliked many Ceremonies and Customs usual in the Schools. When he had finished his Course there,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. Fisher's</HI> Character.</NOTE> he was ordain'd a Priest of the Church; and a certain great Man took him to be his Chaplain; and afterwards he got a Living at <HI>Lidd,</HI> worth about two hundred Pounds a Year. But after having been thus employ'd some Time, he came to see that Infant-Baptism was an humane Institution, and to preach for Wages unlawful. To this, may be added, that <HI>Luke Howard,</HI> some Time before he knew the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, not being satisfied concerning the singing of <HI>Da∣vid</HI>'s Psalms at the publick Worship, so troubled his Master that he had been Apprentice with, that he got <HI>Samuel Fisher,</HI> as a learned Minister, to come and discourse with him, and to try to convince him: And <HI>S. Fisher</HI> talking with him, <HI>L. Howard,</HI> told him, <HI>That God was a Spirit, and must be worshiped in Spirit and Truth, of all those that would worship him acceptably.</HI> And also, <Q>That it was contrary to Truth for a proud Man to sing, <HI>He was not puft in Mind, he had no scornful Eye, and he did not exercise himself in Things that were too high;</HI> when he lived in Pride, wherein God beheld him afar off. And farther, that it was very unbecoming for such an one to sing, <HI>Rivers of Tears run down mine Eyes, because other Men keep not thy Laws,</HI> when he never knew a true Sorrow and Repent∣ance for his own Sins.</Q> This Reason of <HI>Howard</HI>'s against the custo∣mary Singing in their Worship, had so much Influence upon <HI>S. Fisher,</HI> that from that Time he was stop'd from any more giving <HI>David</HI>'s Con∣ditions to the People to sing: And becoming in Time more and more uneasy to go on in acting what was burthensome to his Conscience, he re∣solved to desist from his Ministry, and so went to the Bishop, and deli∣ver'd up the Commission that he had received from him to preach: And tasting himself upon God's Providence, he took a Farm, and turned Grasier, by which Means he maintain'd his Wife and Children much better to his Content than before.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="003104_0113_0FEFF4009014AB30"/>Departing thus from the Episcopalian Church, he went over to the <HI>Baptists,</HI> and became a Zealous Teacher among them. It was about this Time that <HI>W. Caton</HI> and <HI>J. Stubs</HI> came to <HI>Lidd,</HI> whom <HI>S. Fisher</HI> received into his House, remembring that Scripture Exhortation, <HI>Be not forgetful to entertain Strangers, for many thereby have entertained Angels unawares. W. Caton</HI> now went to the Meeting of the <HI>Independents,</HI> and <HI>Stubs</HI> to that of the <HI>Bap∣tists,</HI> where <HI>Fisher</HI> then preached; and <HI>J. Stubs</HI> having got Opportunity to speak, declared Truth so plainly, than <HI>S. Fisher</HI> being very much affected with it, began to paraphrase upon it with Excellency of Speech. <HI>W. Caton</HI> and <HI>J. Stubs</HI> departing this Place, went to another Town in this County, but not long after returning to <HI>Lidd</HI> they found <HI>S. Fisher</HI> in Fel∣lowship with themselves; for it happened that his Fellow-Teacher <HI>George Hammond,</HI> in his Sermon, so violently inveighed against those cal∣led <HI>Quakers,</HI> that <HI>S. Fisher</HI> could not be satisfied until he stood up in the same Meeting, and bore a publick Testimony against the Revisings of <HI>Hammond,</HI> saying to him, <HI>Dear Brother, You are very dear and near to me, but the Truth is nearer and dearer: It is the everlasting Truth and Gospel which they hold forth:</HI> And speaking more Words to that Effect, he openly de∣fended the Doctrine of the reviled <HI>Quakers.</HI> This so vexed <HI>Hammond,</HI> that falling into a greater Rage, he said, <HI>Our Brother</HI> Fisher <HI>is also bewitch∣ed.</HI> But <HI>Fisher</HI> render'd not Reviling for Reviling, but continued witn Pa∣tience in the Faith.

Afterwards they were stripped, and their Necks and Arms put in the Stocks, and in that Condition were desperately whipped. A hard Encounter indeed! especially for such a young Man as <HI>W.

Afterwards Means were used to compel them to work; and it was told them, <HI>He that would not work, should not eat.</HI> But they were not free to consent thereto, because they esteem'd this Demand unjust, being not guilty of the Breach of any Law. Thus they were kept without Victuals for some Days; only a little Water once a Day was allowed them. In the mean while, the Malefactors that were there, would have given them of their Bread; yea, the Women of the House, being moved with Compassion, would have given them someting privately; but they were not free to accept of either. Now the Report of this Cruelty being spread in the Town, many began to be offended at it; so that an Officer was sent to make Re∣stitution of some of their Things, which had been taken from them, and then they bought Victuals with their own Money.

Caton</HI> spoke with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldness, and had pretty good Liberty to declare the Truth. But when he had done, he was taken hold of, and brought before the Magistrates, who order'd that he should be turned out of the Town; which was done. <HI>J. Stubs</HI> was that Day in a Meeting of the <HI>Baptists,</HI> and had some Service there. Not long after, <HI>W. Caton,</HI> who wandring up and down, could not well get any Lodging for his Money, return∣ed, and came into the Town again, the Guard suffering him very freely to pass; and then they both travelled to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they found Things somewhat out of Order, thro' the Unfaithfulness of some that were convinced of the Truth: But their Ministry was so effectual among them, that they were brought into better Order again; and so they edify'd the Church according to their Ability, the Meet∣ing being kept at the House of <HI>William Osburn,</HI> who had been a Lieu∣tenant Colonel, and afterwards became a zealous Minister among the Flock there. While <HI>W.

He also went to <HI>Dowglas,</HI> where his Service was no less, both in the Steeple-house and elsewhere: So that having cleared himself in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> he returned to <HI>England,</HI> and came again to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> where he was receiv'd as formerly, in very great Love.</P>

<PB N="105" REF="003104_0116_0FEFF4418EEB59E8"/>and rejected by his Relations.

About the Middle of the Summer he came to <HI>Colches∣ter,</HI> and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e preached the Gospel on a First-Day of the Week in a Steeple-house, after the Sermon; then in a great Meeting appointed on Purpose, and after that disputed with the Town-Lecturer, and another Priest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of <HI>J. Parnel.</HI> By whom <HI>Ste∣phen Crisp</HI> is convinced.</NOTE> in the <HI>French</HI> School, all in one Day; so that many were con∣vinced of the Truth preached by him; and among these also <HI>Stephen Crisp,</HI> of whom more will be said hereafter. <HI>J. Parnel</HI> spent that Week in the said Town, in Preaching, Exhorting, and Disputing, to the con∣vincing of many; tho' others were inraged, insomuch that his godly Zeal was often rewarded with Blows; as once coming out of <HI>Nicholas</HI> Steeple-house, he was struck by one with a great Staff, who said, <HI>There, take that for Christ's sake.</HI> To which he meekly answer'd, <HI>Friend, I do receive it for Jesus Christ's Sake.</HI> Many other grievous Affronts he bore, without shewing any Heat or Anger; so that he was a real Pattern of Patience and Meekness. Having labour'd in the Gospel about ten Days in <HI>Colchester,</HI> he went to <HI>Coggeshal,</HI> where a Fast was proclaim'd, to be held upon the 12th of the Month call'd <HI>July,</HI> to pray against the Errors of the People call'd <HI>Quakers. J. Parnel</HI> being come thither, went into the Steeple-house, where he stood still, till the Priest was coming out of the Pulpit. Now since this Priestmdash;<HI>Sammes,</HI> who was an <HI>Independent,</HI> had cried out fiercely against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as Deceivers, <HI>J. Parnel</HI> esteem'd it his Duty to say something to that; and the first Words he spoke were, <HI>This is the Order of the true Church, that all may speak one by one; and if any Thing be revealed to him that stands by, let the first hold his Peace.</HI> Then he spoke on in the Behalf of those call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Quakers:</HI> But the Priest interrupting him, ask'd, <HI>What he would object against him?</HI> To which <HI>J. Par∣nel</HI> answer'd, <HI>In that he reviled the People called</HI> Quakers, <HI>and said they were built upon a sandy Foundation, and so call'd them</HI> Shakers. <HI>But,</HI> said he, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll prove their Foundation not to be sandy, and thee to be a false Prophet.</HI> Af∣ter some more Words spoken by him, some accused him, <HI>That he owned no Church:</HI> To which he said, <HI>It was false.</HI> Then it was ask'd him, <HI>What Church he owned?</HI> And he answered, <HI>The Church in God.</HI> Then Priest <HI>Willis</HI> stood up, and said, <HI>He spoke nothing but Nonsense. Parnel</HI> bad him <HI>Name one Word which he had spoken that was Nonsense.</HI> At which <HI>Willis</HI> said, <HI>To say, The Church in God.</HI> Then <HI>Parnel</HI> took out his Bible, and read 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> i. 1. where the Apostle writes to <HI>the Church, which is in God the Fa∣ther.</HI> The Priest was now at a Loss, and <HI>Parnel</HI> told him, <HI>That he blasphem∣ed in saying, the Church in God was Nonsense.</HI> Then the Priest <HI>Stellum</HI> stood up, and accus'd <HI>Parnel</HI> with Lies and Slanders, and not suffering him to clear himself from those Accusations, he got up into the Pulpit, and began to pray: But <HI>Parnel</HI> not taking off his Hat, the Magistrates call'd to him, <HI>to put it off.</HI> To which he returned, <HI>Order the Priest to put off his Cap;</HI> and farther said, <HI>Before he should be subject to their Wills, he would ra∣ther pass out of the Meeting-place;</HI> and so went out. Not long after, Justice <HI>Dionysius Wakering</HI> followed him, and struck him with his Hand upon his Back, saying, <HI>He arrested him in the Name of the Lord Protector. Parnel</HI> not knowing him to be a Magistrate, ask'd him, <HI>Where his Writ</HI> was. <HI>Wake∣ring</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="003104_0117_0FEFF407731C32B0"/>said, <HI>He had one;</HI> but he shewed none. Then <HI>Parnel</HI> was hurried into a House, and some of his Friends engaged, that he should be forth-coming when their Worship was done. And accordingly he appeared where four Justices, and six or seven Priests were met together. Then Justice <HI>Wa∣kering</HI> pull'd his Hat off his Head, and threw it away; and they que∣stion'd him concerning many Things; all which he answer'd, with ma∣ny frivilous Questions ask'd to ensnare him. At last he was committed to the common Jail at <HI>Colchester,</HI> where none of his Friends were suffered to come to him. The Time of the Sessions at <HI>Chelmsford</HI> being come, he, with several Felons and Murderers was fastned to a Chain, and thus led about eighteen Miles thro' the Country, remaining chain'd both Night and Day. Being then brought into the Court before Judge <HI>Hills,</HI> the Jailor took off his Hat, and cast it upon the Floor. Then the Clerk read his Indictment, and asked him, <HI>If he was guilty?</HI> To which he said, That <HI>he denied all Guilt;</HI> and he called for his Accusers. The Judge then said, <HI>he might see them;</HI> and that he ought to say, <HI>Guilty or not Guilty.</HI> On which <HI>Parnel</HI> told him, <HI>He was not Guilty.</HI> Then a Jury of twelve Men was call'd; their Foreman was a Drunkard: Priest <HI>Willis</HI> was also call'd, who swore against him, and so did two Justices; one of their Men swearing, That <HI>they would speak nothing against him but the Truth.</HI> The Accusations were, <HI>That in a riotous Manner he did enter into the Parish Church at</HI> Great Coggeshall; <HI>that he there did stand up, and told the Minister,</HI> he blasphemed, <HI>and spoke falsly, using many other reproachful Words against him: And that he could not give a good Account where he was last settled, or of his Life and Conversation, appearing to be an idle Person.</HI> He was also accused <HI>with Contempt of the Magistracy and of the Ministry.</HI> To this he answer'd, <HI>That he no Ways in a riotous Manner enter'd the Steeple-house, but came thither quietly, and alone: For being followed by several Boys that would have come in after him, he bad them go in before, rather than to go in disorderly, whereby to occasion any Disturbance. That he had said to Priest</HI> Willis, He blasphemed, <HI>by saying,</HI> The Church in God was Non∣sense, <HI>he denied not; but did not own himself to be a Vagabond and idle Person. And he did not think it indecent, to call an unjust Judge,</HI> unrigh∣teous; <HI>a Persecutor,</HI> Persecutor; <HI>and a Deceiver,</HI> Deceiver. Thus <HI>Parnel</HI> pleaded his Cause. Yet the Judge said to the Jury, <HI>That if they did not find him Guilty, the Sin would lie upon their Heads;</HI> thus condemning the Prisoner before the Jury were entered into Deliberation. Then <HI>J. Parnel</HI> began to speak, to inform them concerning his Cause, but the Judge would not suffer him, tho' one of the Jury desired it. After Consultation, the Jury had nothing to lay to his Charge, but a Paper in which he had answered the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> tho' he had already owned this Paper to be his Writing. But in that they were at a Loss, because in the Indictment he was accused of a Riot: Yet the Judge and the Clerk strove to draw some Words from the Foreman, which the other Jury∣men did not consent to, and he himself was unwilling to answer fully to their Questions. Then <HI>J. Parnel</HI> was made to withdraw; and being call'd in again, the Judge fined him to the Value of about For∣ty Pounds, <HI>for Contempt of the Magistracy and Ministry;</HI> for he said, <HI>The</HI> Lord Protector <HI>had charged him to punish such Persons as should contemn ei∣ther Magistracy or Ministry.</HI> Hereupon <HI>J. Parnel</HI> was carried back again to the Prison, being an old ruinous Castle, built as 'tis reported, in the Time of the ancient <HI>Romans:</HI> Here he was to be kept until the Fine should be paid; and the Jailor was commanded, <HI>not to let any giddy-head∣ed People,</HI> (by which Denomination they meant his Friends) <HI>come at him.</HI> The Jailor was willing enough to comply with this Order, suffering none to come to him but such as abused him; and his Wife, who was a

wicked Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew, did not only let her Man to beat him, but several Times herself laid violent Hands on him and swore, <HI>She would have his Blood:</HI> She also set other Prisoners take away the Victuals brought to him by his Friends; and would not let him have a Trundle-Bed, which they would have brought him to lie on, so that he was forced to lie on the cold and damp Stones. Afterwards he was put into the Hole in the Wall, a Room much like to a Baker's Oven; for the Walls of that Building, which is indeed a direful Nest, are of an excessive Thickness, as I have seen my self, having been in the Hole where this pious young Man ended his Days, as will be said by-and-by. Being con∣fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the said Hole, which was, as I remember, about twelve Foot high from the Ground, and the Ladder too short by six Foot; he must climb up and down by a Rope on a broken Wall, which he was forced to do to fetch his Victuals, or for other Necessities, For tho his Friends would have given him a Cord and a Basket to draw up his Victuals in, yet such was the Malice of his Keepers, that they would not suffer this. Continuing in this moist Hole, his Limbs grew benumbed; and thus it once happened, that as he was climbing up the Ladder, with his Victu∣als in one Hand, and come to the Top thereof, catching at the Rope with his other, he missed the same, and fell down upon the Stones, where∣by he was exceedingly wounded in his Head, and his Body so bruised, that he was taken up for dead. Then they put him into a Hole under∣neath the other; for there were two Rows of such vaulted Holes in the Wall. This Hole was called the Oven, and so little, that some Ba∣kers Ovens have been bigger, tho' not so High. Here (the Door be∣ing shut) was scarcely any Air, there being no Window or Hole. And after he was a little recovered from his Fall, they would not suffer him to take the Air, tho' he was almost spent for want of Breath: And tho' some of his Friends, <HI>viz. William Talcot,</HI> and <HI>Edward Grant,</HI> did offer their Bond of 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the Justice, <HI>Henry Barrington,</HI> and another, whose Name was <HI>Thomas Shortland,</HI> to lie Body for Body, that <HI>Parnel</HI> might but have Liberty to come to <HI>W. Talcot</HI>'s House, and return, when reco∣ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; yet this was denied; nay, so immoveably were they set against him, that when it was desired that he might only walk a little sometimes in the Yard, they would not grant it by any Means: And once the Door of the Hole being open, and he coming forth, and walking in a narrow Yard between two high Walls, so incensed the Jailor, that he lock'd up the Hole, and shut him out in the Yard all Night, being in the coldest Time of the Winter. This hard Imprisonment did so weaken him, that after ten or eleven Months he fell sick, and died. At his De∣parture there were with him <HI>Thomas Shortland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Shortland</HI> and <HI>A. Lang∣ley</HI> are with <HI>J. Parnel</HI> at his Death in a Hole in <HI>Col∣chester-Cas∣tle.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Ann Langley:</HI> And it was one of these (that came often to him) who long after brought me into this Hole where he died. Several Things which are related here, I had from the Mouth of Eye-Witnesses, who lived in that Town. When Death approached, he said, <HI>Here I die innocently.</HI> A little after he was heard to say, <HI>Now I must go:</HI> And turning his Head to <HI>Thomas,</HI> he said, <HI>This Death must I die,</HI> Thomas <HI>I have seen great Things: Don't hold me, but let me go.</HI> Then he said again, <HI>Will you hold me?</HI> To which <HI>Ann</HI> an∣swer'd, <HI>No, dear Heart, we will not hold thee.</HI> He had often said, <HI>That one Hour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Sleep would cure him of all:</HI> And the last Words he was heard to say, were, <HI>Now I go;</HI> and then stretch'd out himself, and slept about an Hour, and breathed his last. Thus this valiant Soldier of the Lamb conquer'd thro' Sufferings: And so great was the Malice and Envy of his Persecutors, that to cover their Guilt and Shame they spread among the People, That by immoderate Fasting, and afterwards with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greedy Eating, he had shortned his Days. But this was a wicked
<PB N="108" REF="003104_0119_0FEFF409AD0B5F40"/>Lie; for tho' it be true that he had no Appetite to eat some Days before he fell sick, yet when he began to eat again, he took nothing but a little Milk, as was declared by credible Witnesses.

The Storm continuing, and it being a First-Day of the Week, she went upon the Deck, feeling her self moved to speak to the Seamen by way of Exhortation, and to pray for them; for their Priest, afraid like the rest, could not say any Thing among them. Having spoke what was upon her, she concluded with Prayer; and all the Ship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Crew was very quiet and sedate, saying, <HI>They were more beholden to her than to their Priest, because she prayed for them; and he for Fear could not open his Mouth to speak.</HI> At leng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they arrived safe at <HI>Dublin,</HI> without Damage, which indeed was strange, and made the Master say, That he was never in such a Storm without receiving any Loss. <HI>Barbara</HI> going a-shore, went to the House of the Deputy; but the People told her, <HI>There was for her no speaking with him; for she might know, that he had banisht two of her Friends out of the Nation the Day before.</HI> Then she met with the Secretary, and desired him <HI>to help her to speak with the Deputy.</HI> He answered, <HI>That he did not think he could.</HI> Then she told him, <HI>That if he would be so civil, as to go up and tell the Deputy, that there was a Woman below that would speak with him; if he refused, she was an∣swered.</HI> So the Secretary went up; and there came a Man to fetch her into the Withdrawing Room; and after she had been there a while, a Person came out of the Deputy's Chamber, and all that accompanied him, stood bare-headed (for they knew she never saw the Deputy) but she had a Sense it was a Priest, who shew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself covered to deceive her: And the Room being almost full of People, they ask'd her, <HI>Why she did not do her Message to their Lord.</HI> To which she answered, <HI>When

Farther, that the Enmity did not lie so much in himself, but he was stirred up to it by evil Magistrates, and bad Priests; and that God's People were as dear to him now, as ever; and they that touch'd them, touch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Apple of his Eye. In the mean while, in his Name, and by his Power, there was much Hurt done to the Peo∣ple of God, all over the Nation, and it would at last lie heavy upon him.

Then she went to <HI>Dublin,</HI> where coming into the Court of Justice, she spoke to the Judges; and exhorted them

to Righteousness. But this was taken so ill, that she was put into Pri∣son, where she lay upon S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raw on the Ground; and when it rained, the Wet and Filth of the House of Office ran in under her. Being ar∣raign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at the Bar, she was required to plead, <HI>Guilty or not Guilty.</HI> She answer'd, <HI>That there was no Guilt upon any one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Conscience for what was done in Obedience to the Lord God.</HI> But she not answering in that Form of Words they bid her, was sent back to Prison again, where she suffered much. In the mean while there happened a singular Instance, which I can't pass by with Silence.</P>
<P>At that Time there was in Prison an Innkeeper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Ac∣count of a Murder.</NOTE> with his Family, be∣ing accus'd of a Murder: Now the Brother of him that was either murder'd, or lost, could not enjoy some Land, except he could prove that his Brother was dead, and in Order thereto, he brought a Fellow into the Prison, who said, <HI>He would prove that the Man was killed at such an Inn, and buried under a Wall:</HI> And he accused the Inn-keeper and his Wife, and their Man and Maid, and a Smith to be guilty of this Mur∣der; they being already in Prison. <HI>Barbara</HI> having heard of this, found Means to go to this desperate Fellow; and ask'd him, <HI>How he could conceal this Murder so long, when he was, according to Law, as guilty of it as any of them, if what he said were-true.</HI> At this Question he trembled so exceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngly, that his Knees struck one against another, and he con∣fess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>That he never before saw the said People with his Eyes, nor ever was at the Place in his Life, nor knew any Thing of it, but only he was drawn in by the Man that was to have the Land, and was persuaded to witness the Fact.</HI> Other Prisoners heard this Confession also; and <HI>Barbara</HI> sent to the Deputy, desiring him to send down his Priest, that he might hear the said Con∣fession. The Priest came, and the Fellow confess'd the same to him as he had done to <HI>Barbara,</HI> and he once also confess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the same before the Judge. But afterwards he eat his Words; for the Man that had indu∣ced him, came every Day, and made him drink plentifully, and also caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Jailor to lock up <HI>Barbara,</HI> that she might not come to him. Then she wrote to the Inn-keeper, and his Wife and Man, and also to Judge <HI>Pepes,</HI> and told him, <HI>The Day of his Death did draw nigh, wherein he must give an Account of his Actions; and that therefore he ought to take Heed, that he did not condemn innocent People, having but one Witness, in whose Mouth so many Lies were found, the other all saying they were innocent.</HI> For all that, the Judge went on, and condemned all the Accused, and the Accuser also, as conscious to the Crime. Hereupon a Priest came to speak with the Maid that was condemned, and was in the same Prison with <HI>Barbara;</HI> but she would not see him, saying, <HI>Nay, he can do me no Good: I have done with Man for ever: But God, thou knowest that I am innocent of what they lay to my Charge.</HI> But however, they were all hang'd, and the Witness first, probably for Fear he should have made another Confes∣sion after he had seen the others hang'd.</P>
<P>Now some Friends of <HI>Barbara,</HI> viz. Sir <HI>William King,</HI> Colonel <HI>Fare,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Brown,</HI> hearing she was in Prison, came to see her, and afterward went to the afore-mentioned Judge, to get her released: But when they came to him, he told them, That <HI>he was afraid of his Life.</HI> At which they laughed, and said, <HI>They had known her from a Child, and there was no Harm in her at all.</HI> And being all very earnest to get her Liberty, they at last obtain'd it. Then she went to the Steeple-house, where this Judge was, and cleared her self of him. He being come home, went to Bed, and died that Night. The Noise of which sudden Death being spread, it made People say, <HI>that</HI> Barbara <HI>had been a true Prophetess unto him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="003104_0122_0FEFF44A19E7D218"/>She now went to <HI>Limrick,</HI> where she was put into Prison; but after a while being released,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comes to <HI>Lim∣rick,</HI> is impri∣son'd and re∣leas'd; and in her Return to <HI>England</HI> is robb'd by a Privateer.</NOTE> she took Shipping for <HI>England</HI> again; and at Sea was robbed of all that she had by a Privateer, who coming on Board, took the Master away, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he should pay them a Sum of Money for the Ship and Goods: But she came safe to <HI>England.</HI> She travelled at her own Charge, paying for what she had.</P>

<P>A chief Cause why he was imprisoned there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of his Imprison∣ment, and of <HI>T. Salthouse</HI> his Fellow-Traveller.</NOTE> was, that <HI>Thomas Salt∣house,</HI> with whom he travelled, (having heard that one <HI>George Brooks,</HI> a Priest belonging to the <HI>Nightingale</HI> Frigat, said, after the Declarations of <HI>M. Halhead</HI> and <HI>T. Salthouse</HI> at <HI>Plymouth, That it was the eternal Truth, which they had spoken,</HI> with many other Words in Vindication of what they said) told <HI>Brooks, That he had spoken many good Words and fair Speech∣es;</HI> but ask'd him, <HI>Whether he liv'd the Life of what he spoke?</HI> Farther, <HI>He that entereth not by the Door, but climbeth up some other Way, is, as Christ said, a Thief and a Robber.</HI> For <HI>T. Salthouse</HI> thought, and that not with∣out Reason, as will be shewn by-and-by, that he did not want the Praises of this Priest, that were not better than those of the Damsel possess'd with a Spirit of Divination, which she spoke concerning <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> viz. <HI>These Men are the Servants of the Most High God, which shew unto us the Way of Salvation.</HI> Now what <HI>T. Salthouse</HI> had spoken to the Priest, was call'd provoking Language; the rather, because when the Priest was speaking of the Trinity, <HI>T. Salthouse</HI> had ask'd him, <HI>Where that
<PB N="113" REF="003104_0124_0FEFF44CCAC94E88"/>
Word was to be found in the Scriptures?</HI> Saying farther, <HI>I know no such Scrip∣ture that speaks of the three Persons in the Trinity; but the Three that the Scripture speaks of, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and these Three are One.</HI> From hence <HI>T. Salthouse,</HI> and <HI>M. Halhead</HI> were accu∣sed as such that denied the <HI>Holy Three that are One.</HI> But because about this Accusation they were at a Loss in the Court, something else was thought of to ensnare them, <HI>viz.</HI> they were required to take the <HI>Oath of Abjuration of the Pope.</HI> This Oath the Mayor of <HI>Plymouth</HI> had al∣ready tender'd them, when they were first apprehended; and they re∣fusing to swear, were sent to <HI>Exeter</HI> Prison: And now being brought to Trial, and the said Oath required of them, they answered thus;</P>
<P><HI>In the presence of the Eternal God, and before all this People, we do deny with as much Detestation as any of you doth, the Pope, and his Supremacy, and the Purgatory, and all that is in the Form of the Oath mention'd, we declare freely against<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And we do not deny to swear, because of any Guilt that is up∣on us, but in Obedience to the Command of Christ, who saith,</HI> Swear not at all: <HI>And we will not come under the Condemnation of an Oath, for the Liberty of the outward Man.</HI></P>
<P>Thus refusing to swear, meerly not to trespass against the Command of our Saviour, they were sent back to Prison again, as such that clan∣destinely adher'd to the Pope: And Use hath been made of this Snare during the Space of many Years, to vex the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called. The next Day the Prisoners were brought again before the Bench, and were asked,</P>
<P><HI>Will ye confess that you wronged</HI> G. Brooks <HI>in calling him Thief, and be sorry for it, and make him Satisfaction?</HI></P>
<P>To this <HI>M. Halhead</HI> answered,</P>
<P><HI>One of us did not speak one Word to him, and therefore I deny to make him Satisfaction, or to be sorry for it: And what was spoken, was no such Thing; therefore we will not lie for our Liberty, nor confess that we are sorry for that which we never spoke.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Court fined them five Pounds a-piece;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are fined and sent to <HI>Bridewel.</HI></NOTE> and they were to go to the House of Correction till Payment, and to find Sureties for their good Behaviour: And for refusing to take the Oath, the Court threatned to send into the North to seize on their Estates. So they were returned to Prison; and what follows was entred as the Record of their Proceedings.</P>
<P>July 10. 1655. Thomas Salthouse; <HI>and</HI> Myles Halhead, <HI>for provoking Words against</HI> G.

<P>What is said here of refusing to be try'd by the Country, was a no∣torious Untruth; and as to finding Sureties, that seemed of little Mo∣ment; for tho' the giving of Security had been offer'd before when they were taken Prisoners, yet that was not accepted of; and the Mayor <HI>John Page,</HI> had the Boldness to assert, that they refused to give Security, as will appear by the Warrant by which he sent them to the common Jail in <HI>Exeter,</HI> whereof the following is a true Copy.</P>

<P>Now to what a Heighth of Confidence the aforesaid Mayor <HI>Page</HI> was come, in saying, That <HI>Thomas Salthouse</HI> and <HI>Myles Halhead</HI> had refused to give Bail, nay, that this was the Cause of their Confinement, may also appear from the following Letter he writ to General <HI>Disbrow,</HI> to ex∣cuse his Proceedings against them.</P>

<SALUTE>RIGHT HONOURABLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAptain <HI>Hatsell</HI> hath communicated to me what you wrote him in Reference to those two Men, <HI>Thomas Salthouse</HI> and <HI>Myles Halhead,</HI> of whom, and of their Imprisonment, your Honour had heard something from some Per∣sons of this Place, and receiv'd a Copy of a Letter which they sent me. By the inclosed Copies of their Examinations, your Honour will see some Part of the Cause of their Confinement, which was on their Refusal to give Bail for their Appearance the next general Sessions, to be held for the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> they being, as I conceive, Offenders within the late Ordinance of his Highness the <HI>Lord Protector,</HI> and Counsel, made against Duels, Challenges, and all Provo∣cations
<PB N="115" REF="003104_0126_0FEFF44E7B1BA720"/>
thereunto, and also his Highness's late Proclamation against <HI>Quakers;</HI> and they still refusing to give Bail for their Appearance as aforesaid, went from hence to the Jail at <HI>Exon</HI> on <HI>Tuesday</HI> last. Indeed, <HI>Sir,</HI> their Carriage here was not becoming Men, much less Christians; and besides their Contempt of Au∣thority, all the while they were in Prison, they never sought God by Prayer at any Time, nor desired a Blessing on any Creature they received, or gave Thanks for them. And these very Men were about two Months past taken up by Colonel <HI>Cupplefton,</HI> High Sheriff of our County, and after fourteen Days Restraint, were sent away by him for <HI>Taunton,</HI> from Tithing to Tithing, as by their own Examination; and they shew no Occasion they have to come to these Parts. They are by Profession <HI>Quakers,</HI> but Husbandmen by their Calling: One of them is a <HI>Lancashire</HI> Man, the other of <HI>Westmorland;</HI> and they left their Families, Relations, and Callings about three Months since, as they say, and do not work, nor employ themselves in their Calling, to procure themselves a Livelihood, but wander up and down in all Parts, to vent their wicked Opinions, and dis∣cover their irregular Practices in the Breach of Peace, and Disturbance of good People. Indeed, <HI>Sir,</HI> they hold many sad Opinions, destructive to the true Reli∣gion, and the Power of Godliness. I have hereby, according to my Duty, given your Honour an Account of what pass'd here in Reference to these Men. I could say much more in Reference to their Examination and Discourse with them; but I fear I have already trespassed upon your Honour's Patience in the Perusal of these Lines, and humbly desiring your Excuse for giving you this Trouble, do most thankfully acknowledge your Honour's continu'd Favours to this Place, for which we stand very much obliged, desiring your Honour still to re∣tain such an Opinion of us, as those that desire to do nothing unbecoming Chri∣stians, and Persons that desire the Welfare and Peace of this Common-wealth and Government, and shall ever labour to appear</P>

</LETTER>
<P>That General <HI>Disbrow</HI> was but little satisfied with this Letter, seems not improbable, because enquiring into the Matter, he let others have a Copy of it, so that <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Myles</HI> wrote an Answer to it; and it was also some Time after given out in publick Print at <HI>London,</HI> by <HI>Giles Calvert,</HI> with other Writings relating thereunto. Now as to what is said in this Letter of <HI>His Highness's Proclamation against</HI> Quakers, it was a gross Untruth; for in the Proclamation the <HI>Quakers</HI> were not named; but it was against the Disturbing of Christians in their Assemblies; and besides, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, judged that their publick Worship was permitted them by the 37th Article of the Instrument of Government, which said, <HI>That all that profess Faith in God by Jesus Christ, shall not be re∣strained from, but be protected in the Profession of the Faith, and Exercise of their Religion,</HI> &amp;c. As concerning <HI>their Contempt of Authority,</HI> the Mayor charged them with, it was nothing else, but that for Conscience-sake they could not take off their Hats to the Magistrates; neither did they give that Honour to any other but God alone. And as to what was said, <HI>That all the While they were in Prison, they never sought God by Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. This was no other Matter, than that they did not follow the Formal Way of Prayers; for they were indeed religious Men, who often prayed to God, and gave him Thanks, tho' they were represented in the Letter as very wicked Men, and Vagabonds that had left their Calling, and wander'd up and down the Country; altho' it was well known that they were honest Men, that travell'd on Horseback, and lying at the best inns
<PB N="116" REF="003104_0127_0FEFF415EE6797C8"/>
on the Road, and paying for what they received there. And therefore after they had got a Copy of the said Letter, they writ a large Letter to the Mayor <HI>Page,</HI> and shewed him his abominable Untruths, and told him, that <HI>they had been moved several Times in Prison, as well as out of Prison, to go to Prayers, and to give Thanks for the Blessings of God, which they received.</HI> And in the Conclusion of their Letter, they signified, <HI>That they would not render Railing for Railing; but</HI> (said they) <HI>in the Spirit of Love and Meekness we exhort you all to repent, and fear to offend the Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the <HI>provoking Words against</HI> George Brooks, for which they had been fined, it hath been said already what they were; but this <HI>Brooks</HI> was of a dissolute Life, and a debauch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Fellow, having for his Drunkenness not only been turned out of the Frigates in which he had served, but also once in the Ship <HI>Nightingale,</HI> ignominiously expos'd with a Quarter Can about his Neck, as appears by the following Testi∣monies.</P>

<P>From such Evidences as these it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. White∣head, Rich. Clayton, <HI>and</HI> J.

another to speak that stands by, when any Thing is revealed, but send him to Prison; whether this was not the setting up a persecuting Spirit, limiting the Spirit of God, and despising Prophecies, not daring to try all Things? Whether it was expedient to give to Scoffers, Scorners, Drunkards, Swearers, and Per∣secutors,</HI> David's <HI>Conditions to sing? And if such were set up that took Tythes, tho' the Apostle said that the Priesthood was changed, and the Law also,</HI> Heb. vii. <HI>Whether by the setting of such, they did not set up such as did not labour in the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neyard?</HI></P>
<P>This Paper being set up, People came to read it: <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> being there, and laying hold of this Opportunity, spoke a few Words to the People, and exhorted them <HI>to turn to the Lord from the Vanities and Wicked∣nesses they lived in.</HI> And when <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> and his Fellow-Travellers were passing away, there came a Constable who staid them, and carried them before <HI>Harbert Pelham</HI> Justice of Peace. He asking several vain Questi∣ons, and behaving himself rudely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are bad be∣fore Justice <HI>Pelham,</HI> who sends them to Justice <HI>Wal∣grave</HI> at <HI>Smalbridge,</HI> and comes thither also. <HI>Clayton</HI> is or∣dered to be whipt, and <HI>Whitehead</HI> and <HI>Harwood</HI> sent to Prison.</NOTE> <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> began to speak to him concerning his Rage: But <HI>Pelham</HI> said, <HI>He did not send for him to preach.</HI> And not being able to lay the Transgression of any Law to their Charge, he sent them, by the Constable, to <HI>Thomas Walgrave,</HI> Justice of Peace at <HI>Smalbridge</HI> in <HI>Suffolk.</HI> Being come into his House, <HI>Richard Clayton</HI> was first examined, of his Name, and Country, and where he had been. The same and some other frivolous Questions were asked of <HI>G. White∣head.</HI> Then <HI>Walgrave</HI> ask'd <HI>John Harwood, If he would answer him all the Questions that he should demand of him:</HI> But <HI>J. Harwood</HI> refused to be limi∣ted thus to his Will. Justice <HI>Pelham</HI> now being come thither also, <HI>J. Harwood</HI> told Justice <HI>Walgrave,</HI> that <HI>Pelham,</HI> who had before examined him, had his Examination in Writing. Then the two Justices con∣sulted together what to do in the Case? and not long after <HI>Thomas Wal∣grave</HI> asked <HI>G. Whitehead, if he would work at Hay?</HI> But he denied to be bound to such Task-Masters, as being in that Calling whereunto God had called him, and wherein he was chargeable to no Man. The Con∣clusion of their Consultation was, that they caused <HI>R. Clayton</HI> to be whipt, under Pretence of having fastned a seditious Paper to the Stee∣ple-house-Door; and the other two were imprisoned.</P>
<P>It was about this Time that <HI>William Dewsbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Dewsbu∣ry</HI> at <HI>Wel∣ling borough</HI> call'd to by Priest <HI>An∣drews,</HI> whom he visits at the Steeple-house, is kept in Prison half a Year, then brought to his Trial at <HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI> with other before Judge <HI>Atkins.</HI></NOTE> and several other of his Friends were put into Prison at <HI>Northampton.</HI> It happened that he being at <HI>Wellingborough,</HI> and going along the Streets, the Priest <HI>Thomas Andrews</HI> called to him in these Words, <HI>Give over deceiving the People, lest the Plagues of God fall on thee.</HI> To this <HI>Dewsbury</HI> returned, <HI>Dost thou say I deceive the People? Make it manifest wherein I deceive them.</HI> Then <HI>Andrews said, Thou say'st there is not any Original Sin.</HI> To this <HI>Dewsbury</HI> replied, <HI>Didst thou hear me say so?</HI> But the Priest unwilling to answer that Questi∣on, went away. Afterwards <HI>Dewsbury</HI> went into the Steeple-House in the said Town, and after the Sermon was done, he demanded of the Priest that he would prove there before the People, what he had open∣ly accused him of, <HI>viz. That he had said, there was no Original Sin.</HI> But the Priest would not answer, but fled away. There was also Informati∣on given, that <HI>Dewsbury</HI> had said, <HI>The Priests preach for Hire, and the Peo∣ple love to have it so: But what will ye do in the End thereof?</HI> But that this was really so, I don't find. <HI>Dewsbury</HI> then being committed to Pri∣son, and kept there above half a Year, was at last brought to his Tryal at <HI>Northampton,</HI> with other Prisoners, his Friends; and being set to the Bar, the Judge— <HI>Atkins</HI> said to the Jailor, <HI>Do you use to bring Prisoners before the Court in this Manner? You deserve to be fined ten Pounds, for bringing them before the Court cover'd.</HI> The Jailor answer∣ed, <HI>If you command me, I will take off their Hats.</HI> To which the Judge gave Command, and the Jailor's Man took them off. Then the Judge
<PB N="118" REF="003104_0129_0FEFF418409A5F88"/>
said to <HI>Dewsbury, What art thou here for?</HI> And <HI>Dewsbury</HI> answered, <HI>The Mittimus will express what I was committed for; but a Copy of it I am denied by the Keeper of the Jail.</HI> The next Query of the Judge was, <HI>What is thy Name?</HI> And the Answer was, <HI>Ʋnknown to the World. Let us hear,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>What that Name is that the World knows not. It is,</HI> quoth <HI>Dews∣bury, known in the Light, and none can know it, but he that hath it; but the Name, the World knows me by, is</HI> William Dewsbury. Then said the Judge, <HI>What countryman art thou?</HI> And <HI>Dewsbury</HI> answered, <HI>Of the Land</HI> Canaan. <HI>That's far off,</HI> replied the Judge. <HI>Nay,</HI> said Dewsbury; <HI>for all that dwell in God, are in the Holy City,</HI> New Jerusalem, which comes down from Heaven, <HI>where the Soul is in Rest, and enjoys the Love of God in Jesus Christ, in whom the Ʋnion is with the Father of Light.</HI> To this the Judge returned, <HI>That is true, but are you ashamed of your Country? Is it a Disparagement for you to be born in</HI> England? <HI>Nay,</HI> said Dewsbury, <HI>I am free to declare that my Natural Birth was in</HI> Yorkshire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Dewsbu∣ry</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t far from <HI>Hull</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nine Miles from</HI> York, <HI>towards</HI> Hull. Then the Judge said, <HI>You pretend to be extraordi∣nary Men, and to have an extraordinary Knowledge of God.</HI> To which, <HI>Dewsbury</HI> reply'd, <HI>We witness the Work of Regeneration to be an extraordi∣nary Work, wrought in us by the Spirit of God. But,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>the Apostles wrought with their Hands in their Callings. They had,</HI> answer'd Dewsbury, <HI>Callings in the World, some were Fishermen,</HI> Paul <HI>a Tent-ma∣ker; but when they were called to the Ministry of Christ, they left their Cal∣lings, to follow Christ, whither he led them by his Spirit to preach the Word: And I had a Calling in the World, as they had, and in it did abide, until the Father revealed his Son in me, and called me from my Calling I had in the World, to preach the eternal Word he had made known to me in the great Work of Regeneration. Why,</HI> queried the Judge, <HI>didst thou not abide in thy own Country, and teach People in them Parts? There I did stay,</HI> returned Dewsbury, <HI>until I was called from thence to go where I was led by the Spirit of the Lord;</HI> and as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons and Daughters of God; <HI>and they that have not the Spirit of Christ are none of his.</HI> To this the Judge said, <HI>You say well; for we must in Cha∣rity conclude, that every one in this Place hath the Spirit of God in him: But how do you know that you are guided by the Spirit of God? They that have the Spirt of God,</HI> replied Dewsbury, <HI>are known by their Fruits; and he that believeth in Jesus Christ, and is guided by his Spirit, hath the Witness in himself. That is true,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>yet notwithstanding, I see by your Carriage, that what my Brother</HI> Hale <HI>did at the last Assizes, in requiring Bond for your good Behaviour, he might justly do it; for you are against Magistrates and Ministers.</HI> But <HI>Dewsbury</HI> returned, <HI>Make that manifest wherein we are against them.</HI> Then said the Judge to the Clerk, <HI>Robert Guy, What have you against these Men?</HI> And he gave Relation of what <HI>Dews∣bury</HI> had said to the Priest <HI>Andrews</HI> in the Steeple-house. <HI>Dewsbury</HI> then giving an Account of the Matter of Fact, and how the Thing happened; and that it was not any Breach of the Law of the Nation; the Judge resumed, <HI>But in that you are found wandering in the Country, you break the Law; for there is an old Law, That if any did go from their Dwellings to travel in the Country without a Certificate from some Justice, they were to be taken as wandring Persons.</HI> To this, <HI>Dewsbury</HI> said, <HI>If there be any such Law, read it to us; and if there be such a Law, thou knowest in thy Conscience it is contrary to the Scripture; for the Apostles and Ministers of Christ went to and fro in the Country preaching the Word of eternal Life; and there were added to the Church daily such as should be saved; and the Number of the Saints and Brethren was daily encreased: And the Law that is in Force in this Nation, doth allow all that profess Faith in Jesus Christ, to have free Liberty to walk in the Faith, which is according to Scripture.</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="003104_0130_0FEFF454631C7EB0"/>
To this the Judge said, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had an eloquent Tongue, and thou art proud of it.</HI> Pride, <HI>I deny,</HI> replied <HI>Dewsbury, but the Truth I witness, which will judge Pride,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Judge, tho' he beha∣ved himself moderately, continues them in Pri∣son.</NOTE> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in it, <HI>until it be destroy'd.</HI> The Judge thou spoke to the other Prisoners; and tho' he behaved himself moderately, yet he could not resolve to set them at Liberty; but they were continued in Pri∣son, tho' they had been kept there above twenty nine Weeks. One of these Prisoners was <HI>John Huchin,</HI> whom they had nothing else to charge with, but that being come into the Steeple-house at <HI>Wellingborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Particularly <HI>J.

Another of the Prisoners was <HI>Michael Pattison,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Pattison.</NOTE> who having been in the same Steeple-house, and stood peaceably in Silence until the Priest <HI>Andrews</HI> had done, and the People were going away, said to him, <HI>Friend, canst thou witness this to be the Word of the Lord, that thou hast spoken here before the People?</HI> But this so of∣fended the Priest, that he commanded the Officers to take <HI>Michael</HI> away, which the Constable <HI>John Brown</HI> did.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And</HI> Thomas Goodyar.</NOTE> <HI>Thomas Goodyar,</HI> who also was one of the Prisoners, being come to <HI>Northampton</HI> to visit his Friends in Prison there, it was denied him by the Jailor; and he meeting the Mayor and some Aldermen in the Streets, spoke to them about Persecu∣tion; but one of the Aldermen struck off his Hat, and said, <HI>he would teach him better Manners, than to stand and talk before the Mayor with his Hat on.</HI> Then they required Sureties for his good Behaviour; and he told them, <HI>That he was bound to good Behaviour by the righteous Law of God:</HI> And refu∣sing to find Sureties, he was taken up in the Street, and sent to Prison without Mittimus, or farther Examination. But I won't detain my Reader any longer with these Prisoners; for if I should relate all Oc∣currences of this Nature that are come to my Knowledge, and un∣der what unreasonable Pretences, even such that were as yet not fully entred into the Communion of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> were committed to Prison, I must write much more than I might be able to do, tho' my Life should yet be lengthened considerably.</P>
<P>I find among my Papers of this Time the Names of about an hundred Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

<P>But passing by a Multitude of the like Cases, I return again to <HI>G.

Fox</HI> being thus set at Liberty, tra∣velled on to <HI>Lynn,</HI> from whence he went to <HI>Sutton,</HI> where he had a great Meeting, many People from other Places being come thither, and also the Mayor's Wife of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and many Hundreds were convinced of the Truth he preach'd. From thence he passed to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and tho' the Scholars were exceeding rude, yet he got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an inn. In the Dark of the Evening the Mayor of the Town came, and fetch'd him to his House, whither some friendly People were sent for, and he had a Meeting there. Next Morning he departed the Town, and re-returned to <HI>London,</HI> where he staid some Time. In this Year came out the Oath of Abjuration against King <HI>Charles,</HI> whereupon he wrote to the Protector,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writes to the Protector.</NOTE> acquainting him that many of his Friends, who could not swear for Conscience-sake, suffered much on this Account.</P>
<P>From <HI>London</HI> he went to <HI>Leicestershire;</HI> and coming to <HI>Whetstone,</HI> where formerly he had been taken by Colonel <HI>Hacker,</HI> he now had a great Meeting there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to <HI>Lei∣cestershire.</HI> Has a great Meeting at <HI>Whetstone,</HI> where Colonel <HI>Hacker's</HI> Wife, his Mar∣shal, and ma∣ny more are convinc'd.

Fox</HI>'s Ministry; who go∣ing from thence, and after having passed thro' many Places, came again to <HI>London,</HI> where meeting <HI>James Naylor,</HI> and casting his Eyes upon him, he was struck with a Fear concerning him, being, as it were, under a Sense of some great Disaster that was like to befal him.</P>
<P>In this Year <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> wrote a Letter to the Protector, wherein he told him, <HI>That the Lord's Controversy was against him, because he had not been faithful in God's Work; but that he had taken his Rest and Ease upon a lofty Mountain of Pride and Vain Glory, having set up himself to be worshipped, and exalting his own Horn, without giving Glory and Honour to God.</HI> Moreo∣ver, <HI>that he had not perform'd his Vows made to the Lord in the Day of Distress; and that now he suffered grievous Oppression, Cruelty, and Tyranny to be acted in his Name by unjust Imprisonments, and Persecution of the Lord's People. That therefore the Lord would bring his Judgments upon him, except be did re∣pent.</HI> How boldly soever <HI>Burrough</HI> wrote in this Letter to <HI>Cromwel,</HI> yet I do not find that he shewed himself angry because of it: But yet he heark∣ened too much to the Flatteries of those Teachers, who being now en∣tred into the Possessions of the <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> exalted him as their Idol, by their Applause: And he revering them as such who could strengthen his Authority with the People, winked at the grievous Persecution, by their Instigation carried on against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called.</P>
<P>In the mean While there were many Malecontents, who could not bear that <HI>Cromwel</HI> should force the Members of Parliament to consent to make no Change in the Government then establish'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Trans∣actions.</NOTE> and would not suffer any one to sit in the House, without having promised by Writing not to propose or give his Consent there to the Change of the said Go∣vernment. This gave Occasion, that even some of those who had been his eminent Friends, now did not stick to reprove him sharply: Among these was Lieutenant Colonel <HI>John Lilburn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some memo∣rable Passages concerning <HI>J. Lilburn.</HI></NOTE> who being an extraordinary bold Man, very stiff and inflexible, had more than once shew'd himself a publick Assertor of the People's Liberties and Freedoms; for which he had been prosecuted at Law, <HI>viz.</HI> once in the Year 1645, when he was
<PB N="121" REF="003104_0132_0FEFF456D755A5E8"/>
publick Assertor of the People's Liberties and Freedoms; for which he had been proscuted at Law, <HI>viz.</HI> once in the Year 1645, when he was imprisoned as guilty of Treason, but was discharged; and afterwards in the Year 1649, when having publish'd several Books, to expose to the Publick, the arbitrary Power he thought was exercised in the Government, he was confined in the Tower: And after having been Prisoner above seven Months, was impeach'd of High Treason: But he so vigorously de∣fended his Cause, that tho' strong Perswasions had been used to move the Jury to bring him in guilty, yet he so far prevailed, that at length he was set at Liberty again; tho' I find that once he was whipt for a Crime laid to his Charge, of which he gloried publickly. And when <HI>Cromwel</HI> had usurp'd the supreme Power, <HI>Lilburn</HI> made bold to charge him, both by Word of Mouth, and by Writing, with Falseness and Tyranny; and he went on at that Rate, that <HI>Cromwel,</HI> foreseeing that, it this Man con∣tinu'd thus to expose his Doings, he should not be able to maintain his Credit and Authority, ordered him to be taken into Custody and im∣peach'd of High Treason. When <HI>Lilburn,</HI> thus accused, appeared at the Bar, he behaved himself with that Undauntedness, and so defended his Cause, that, he seemed less to plead for his Life, than for the Freedom of his Country: And boldly answering what was objected to him, said, <Q>That what he had done, was not only no High Treason, but the Go∣vernment was such, that no High Treason could be committed against it; and that therefore all true <HI>Englishmen</HI> were obliged to oppose the Tyranny that was exercised.</Q> He also said, <Q>That having been once much in Favour with <HI>Cromwel,</HI> he might have attained to great Prefer∣ment, if he would have been quiet; but that he having thought this unlawful, it was now resolved to have his Life taken away; which he did not fear, because he asserted a good Cause.</Q> Thus vigorously <HI>Lilburn</HI> pleaded, and he defended his Cause with such strong Arguments, that the Jury brought him in <HI>not guilty,</HI> notwithstanding the Endeavours of the Judges to the contrary. Now, tho' according to Law he must have been set at Liberty, yet <HI>Cromwel</HI> would not consent to it, but kept him Prisoner; and because he indeed feared him, as one that would weaken his Government, he ordered him to be carried from one Prison to another, till at length he came to be confined in the Castle of <HI>Dover,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who while Prisoner in <HI>Dover-Castle</HI> comes to be acquainted with <HI>L. How∣ard,</HI> and is partly con∣vinc'd.</NOTE> in which Town liv'd <HI>Luke Howard,</HI> mentioned before; who thereby ha∣ving occasion to speak with <HI>Lilburn</HI> concerning Religion, gave him such convincing Reasons for his Profession, as prevailed upon <HI>Lilburn</HI> to receive the Truth, as he himself signified in a Letter he wrote to his Wife; who having visited him in Prison, afterwards wrote to him this following Exhortation:</P>

I hope God is doing a Work upon thee and me too, as shall make us study our selves more than we have done.</HI></P>
<P>These Words were so acceptable to <HI>Lilburn,</HI> that repeating them in his Letter to her, he answered thus, after many other Passages:</P>

<P>Whilst <HI>Lilburn</HI> was Prisoner here, <HI>Cromwel,</HI> as it seem'd, would have released him, if he would have signed a Declaration that he would ne∣ver draw a Sword against his Government. But <HI>Lilburn</HI> as yet not being fully convinced, that to refrain the Use of the carnal Sword, was the Duty of a true Christian, refused, thinking; that tho' <HI>G. Fox</HI> had signed such a Declaration, yet this did not become him, because he did not perfectly approve that Point of Self-denial. But however, continuing in Faithfulness to persevere in Respect of that Knowledge he had already attained to, he became, in Process of Time, such an Assertor of the true Christian Life, that in a Paper, which at his Desire was given out in Print, he express'd himself thus:</P>

<P>I have now the faithfull and true Witness, in my own Soul, that the Lord himself is become within me the Teacher of my Soul, and Enabler of me to walk in a Measure of his pure Ways and Paths; yea, and so clear a Teacher within me is he already become unto me, as that I with Confidence believe my inward Teacher shall never now more be removed into a Corner; but is, and shall be, as a continual Voice speaking in my Ears, <HI>This is the Way, walk in it:</HI> By which di∣vine Teaching I am now daily taught to die to Sin, and led up by it into living Power, to be raised up, and enabled to live in a pure Measure of Righteousness, and by which inward spiritual Teachings, I am, I say again, led up into Power in Christ, by which I particu∣larly can, and do hereby witness, that I am already dead, or cruci∣fied to the very Occasions, and real Grounds of all outward Wars, and carnal Sword-fightings, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eshly Bustlings and Contests; and that therefore considently I now believe, I shall never hereafter be an User of a temporal Sword more, nor a Joiner with those that so do.

<P>It sufficiently appears by this, that <HI>Lilburn</HI> did not think that this Declaration would procure his Liberty; and he guess'd not wrong; for before he was releas'd, <HI>Cromwel</HI> died. <HI>Lilburn</HI> being then discharged from his Confinement, continu'd stedfast to the Doctrine of the Truth he had embraced, and died at <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1660.

<P>And thus I conclude this Book with the Year 1655, in which Year there was a Plot of the Royalists against <HI>Cromwel;</HI> and in <HI>Nottingham∣shire,</HI> they had already surprised some Places; and towards the West the City of <HI>Salisbury.</HI> The young King <HI>(Charles)</HI> was now come from <HI>Cologne,</HI> into <HI>Zealand,</HI> to be the nearer if the Attempt succeeded.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHIRSTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1656</NOTE> The FOURTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>NEAR the Beginning of the Year 1656.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> goes to <HI>Surry, Chichester, Portsmouth,</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> where <HI>W. Baily a Bap∣tist</HI> is convin∣ced and comes to have a pub∣lick Testimony, Thence to <HI>Southampton</HI> and <HI>Dorches∣ter,</HI> where he discourses with the Bap∣tists about Water Bap∣tism, and many substan∣tial People are convinc'd.</NOTE> <HI>G. Fox</HI> went from <HI>London,</HI> to <HI>Surry, Chichester, Portsmouth,</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> where <HI>Wil∣liam Baily,</HI> a <HI>Baptist</HI> Teacher, and some others were convinced by <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Ministry, and entred into the Society of those called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> among whom <HI>Baily</HI> afterwards became an eminent Minister. From <HI>Pool, G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Southampton</HI> and <HI>Dorchester,</HI> where he desired of the <HI>Baptists</HI> to have their Meeting-House to meet in: But they re∣fusing, he sent them Word, <HI>That they might come to his Inn, if they pleased.</HI> Many of them came with their Teacher, and they fell into a Discourse about Water-Baptism. <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked them, <HI>Whether they could say they were sent of God to baptize People, as</HI> John <HI>was? And whether they had the same Spirit and Power, that the Apostles had?</HI> They said, <HI>They had not.</HI> Then he asked them, <HI>How many Powers then are? Whether there are any more, than the Power of God, and the Power of the Devil?</HI> And they said, <HI>There was not any other Power than those two.</HI> Then said <HI>G. Fox, If you have not the Power of God, that the Apostles had, then you act by the Power of the Devil.</HI> And his speaking was of such Effect, that many Substantial People were convinced that Night. Next Morning when he was passing away, the Baptists began to shake the Dust from off their Feet after him. <HI>What,</HI> said he, <HI>in the Power of Darkness! We who are in the Power of God, shake off the Dust of our Feet against you.</HI> Thus leaving <HI>Dorchester</HI> he came to <HI>Weymouth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Then to <HI>Wey∣mouth,</HI> where at a Priest's House many receive his Te∣stimony; and also a Captain remarkable for Laughter.</NOTE> where enquiring after the sober People, about Fourscore of them gathered together at a Priest's House; and most of them were turned to Christ Jesus, who had enlightened them with his divine Light, by which they were reproved of their Sins. There was at that Time a Captain of Horse in the Town, who rode about seven Miles out of Town with <HI>G. Fox:</HI> This Cap∣tain was of such a merry Temper, and so exceedingly given to Laugh∣ter, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> several Times spoke very seriously to him about it; but it was become so customary to him, that he would laugh al∣most at any Thing he saw. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> still admonish'd him to Gravi∣ty, and the Fear of the Lord; and of this he spoke to him again when they parted. The next Time <HI>G. Fox</HI> saw him, the Captain told him, <HI>That when he spoke to him at parting, the Power of the Lord so struck him, that before he got home, he was serious enough, and had left his Laughing.</HI> He indeed became a serious and good Man; and being convinced of the Truth, died in the real Profession thereof.</P>
<P>For Brevities-Sake I don't intend to mention all the Places <HI>G. Fox</HI> past thro',<NOTE PLACE="marg">Has good ser∣vice at Kings∣bridge.</NOTE> much less all his Occurrences. At <HI>Kingsbridge</HI> he had good Ser∣vice; and returning in the Evening to his Inn, and there being many People drinking, he was moved to go amongst them, and to direct them <Q>To the Light which Christ, the heavenly Man, had enlightened them withal; by which Light they might see all their evil Ways, Words.
<PB N="125" REF="003104_0136_0FEFF45BEAC28498"/>
and Deeds: and by the same Light they might also see Christ Jesus their Saviour.</Q> But this Discourse did not please the Inn-keeper, seeing it hindred his Guests from drinking: And hearing <HI>G. Fox</HI> speak so much of the Light, he snatcht away the Candle, and said, <HI>Come, here is Light for you, to go into your Chamber.</HI> The next Day <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cornwall;</HI> and travelling thro' the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to <HI>Mar∣ket-Jew</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where he meets with Trouble; and more in Com∣pany with <HI>E.

This Paper came accidentally to the Hands of <HI>Peter Ceely,</HI> a Major in the Army, and also a Justice of Peace at <HI>Ives,</HI> whither <HI>G. Fox</HI> came.

Fox</HI> was walking down to the Sea-side: But he hearing this, followed them, and came also into the Justice's House, where the aforesaid Paper being produced, it was asked him, <HI>Whether he would own it?</HI> and he said <HI>Yes.</HI> Then the Major tendered them the Oath of Abjuration. <HI>G.

But to proceed, <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Companions were taken into Custody, and with a Guard of Horse sent to Prison with this Mittimus.</P>

<P>By this Mittimus it appears under what odd Pretences the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, were committed to Prison; for such Reasons as are mentioned therein, might be found and pickt up at any Time.

Being come to <HI>Lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ston, Keat</HI> deliver'd the Prisoners to the Jailor. And tho' many were greatly enraged against them, and expected that these Prisoners, who <HI>Thou'd and Thee'd</HI> all, and did not put off their Hats to any Man, should at the Assizes be condemned to be hang'd, if they did not pay that Respect to the Bench; yet there were many friendly People, that out of several Parts of the Country came to visit them; for it was about nine Weeks from the Time of their Commitment to the Assizes; by Reason of which several got Opportunity to speak with them, which had that good Effect, that many were convinced of the Truth of the Doctrine held forth by them.</P>
<P>At the Time of the Assizes Abundance of People came from far and near to hear the Trial of the <HI>Quakers;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought into Court at the Assizes, are examined by Judge <HI>Glyn,</HI> with whom <HI>G.

Being brought into the Court, <HI>G. Fox,</HI> after all was quiet, said, <HI>Peace be amongst you.</HI> The Judge <HI>(Glyn,)</HI> who was then Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> said to the Jailor, <HI>What be these you have brought here into the Court? Prisoners, My Lord,</HI> said he, <HI>Why do not you put off your Hats?</HI> said the Judge to them. They saying nothing; <HI>Put off your Hats,</HI> said the Judge again: And they still continuing silent, the Judge said, <HI>The Court commands you to put off your Hats.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> began to speak, and said, <Q>Where did ever any Magistrate, King, or Judge, from <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Daniel,</HI> command any to put off their Hats, when they came before them in their Courts, either amongst the <HI>Jews,</HI> (the People of God) or amongst the Heathen? And if the Law of <HI>England</HI> doth command any such Thing, shew me that Law, either written or printed.</Q> The Judge then growing angry, said, <HI>I do not carry my Law-Books on my Back.</HI> But said G. Fox, <HI>Where is it printed in any Statute-Book, that I may read it?</HI> At this the judge said, <HI>Take him away, Prevaricator! I ll ferk him.</HI> Then the Prisoners were taken away, and put among the Thieves. But present∣ly after the Judge call'd to the Jailor, <HI>Bring them up again.</HI> This being done, <HI>Come,</HI> said he, <HI>Where had they Hats from</HI> Moses <HI>to</HI> Daniel? <HI>Come answer me; I have you fast now.</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> replied, <HI>Thou mayst read in the Third of</HI> Daniel, <HI>that the three Children were cast into the fiery Furnace, by</HI> Nebuchadnezzar's <HI>Command, with their Coats, their Hose, and their Hats on.</HI> This plain Instance stopt him; so that not having any Thing else to say, He cried again, <HI>Take them away Jailor.</HI> Accordingly they were taken away, and being thrust among the Thieves, they were kept there a great While, and at length carried again to Prison: But in the Afternoon they were brought up again into the Court. <HI>G. Fox</HI> seeing the Jurymen there, gave them a Paper which he had written against Swearing. This Pa∣per passing from the Jury to the Justices, they presented it to the Judge; and he bid the Clerk give <HI>G. Fox</HI> that Paper, and then asked him, <HI>Whether that seditious Paper was his?</HI> To which he said, <HI>If they would read it in open Court, that he might hear it, if it was his, he would own it, and stand by it.</HI> The Judge now would have <HI>G. Fox</HI> to have taken it, and look∣ed upon it in his own Hand. But he desired again, <HI>That it might be read, that all in the Court might hear it, and judge whether there was any Se∣dition in it, or no; for if there were, he was willing to suffer for it.</HI> At length the Clerk of the Assizes read it with an audible Voice; and when he had done, <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>It was his Paper, and he would own it; and so might they too, except they would deny the Scripture: For was it not Scripture Language, and the
<PB N="127" REF="003104_0138_0FEFF45F00D881C8"/>
Words and Commands of Christ and the Apostles, which all true Christians ought to obey?</HI> Then they let fall that Subject, and the Judge speaking again about the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Prisoners, bid the Jailor, <HI>take them off.</HI> Then they asked, <HI>What they had lain in Prison for these nine Weeks, seeing now nothing was objected against them, but what concerned their Hats? And;</HI> said G. Fox, <HI>as for Putting off our Hats, that was the Honour which God would lay in the</HI> Dust, <HI>tho' they made so much ado about it: The Honour which is of Men, and which Men seek one of another is the Mark of Ʋn∣believers:</HI> For how can ye believe, <HI>saith Christ,</HI> who receive Honour one of another, and seek not the Honour that cometh from God only? <HI>And Christ saith also,</HI> I receive not Honour from Men, <HI>and all true Christians should be of his Mind.</HI> Then the Judge made a Speech, <HI>How he represented the Lord</HI> Protector's <HI>Person; and how he had made him Lord Chief Justice of</HI> England, <HI>and sent him to come that Circuit; &amp;c.</HI> Thereupon the Prisoners desired him, <HI>That he would do them Ju∣stice for their false Imprisonment, which they had suffered nine Weeks.</HI> But instead thereof, an Indictment was read against them, but so full of Untruths, that <HI>G Fox</HI> thought it had been against some of the Thieves; for it contained, <HI>That they came by Force and Arms, and in an hostile Manner into the Court;</HI> whereas they were brought there as Prisoners; which made him say, <HI>It was all false.</HI> And still they cried for Justice for their false lmprisonment, being taken up in their Jour∣ney without Cause, by Major <HI>Ceely.</HI> Then this <HI>Peter Ceely,</HI> who as a Justice of Peace sat also on the Bench,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The foolish malice of Ma∣jor <HI>Ceely.</HI></NOTE> said to the Judge, <HI>May it please you,</HI> My Lord, <HI>This Man, (pointing to <HI>G. Fox</HI>) <HI>went aside with me; and told me how serviceable I might be for his Design; that he Could raise forty thousand Men at an Hour's Warning, and involve the Nation into Blood, and so bring in King</HI> Charles: <HI>and I would have aided him out of the Country, but he would not go. And if it please you,</HI> My Lord, <HI>I have a Witness to swear it.</HI> And so he called upon his Witness, who, without Question, was one that was brib'd. But the Judge perceiving this palpable Lie, was not forward to examine the Wit∣ness. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> desired the Judge, <HI>That he would be pleased to let his</HI> Mittimus <HI>be read, in which the pretended Crime was signified, for which he was committed to Prison.</HI> But the Judge said, <HI>It should not be read. G. Fox</HI> still insisting to have it read, said, <HI>It ought to be: For if I have done any Thing worthy of Death, or of Bonds; let all the Country know it.</HI> Seeing then they would not read it, he said to one of his Fellow. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soners, <HI>Thou hast a Copy of it, read it up. It shall not be read</HI> said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Judge, <HI>Jailor, take him away; I'll see whether he or I shall be Master.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> was taken away, and a While after called for again. He still cried to have the <HI>Mittimus</HI> read, and the People being eager to hear it, he bid his Fellow-Prisoner to read it up. Which being done, and read according to the Copy already mention'd, <HI>G. Fox</HI> said to the Judge and Justices, <HI>Thou that say'st, thou art Chief Justice of</HI> England, <HI>and you that be Justices, ye know, that if I had put in Sureties, I might have gone whether I pleased, and have carried on the Design, if I had had one, which Major</HI> Ceely <HI>hath charged me with. And if I had spoken those Words to him; which he hath here declared, then judge ye, whether Bail or Mainprize could have been taken in that Case.</HI> Then directing his Speech to Major <HI>Ceely,</HI> he said, When, or where did I take thee aside? Was not thy House full of rude People, and thou as rude as any of them at our Examination, so that I asked for a Constable, or other Officer to keep the People civil? But if thou art my Accuser, why sittest thou on the Bench? That is not a Place for thee to sit in; for Accusers do not use to sit with the Judges: Thou ought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="128" REF="003104_0139_0FEFF425DA31AC58"/>
est to come down, and stand by me, and look me in the Face. Besides, I would ask the Judge and Justices this Question, Whether or no Major</HI> Cee∣ly <HI>is not guilty of this Treason, which he charges against me, in conceal∣ing it so long as he hath done? Doth he understand his Place, either as a Soldier,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> charg'd with being in a Plot to raise 40000 Men to bring in King <HI>Charles.</HI></NOTE> or a Justice of the Peace? For he tells you here,</HI> <Q>That I went aside with him, and told him, what a Design I had in Hand, and how serviceable he might be for it: That I could raise forty thousand Men in an Hour's Time, and bring in King <HI>Charles,</HI> and involve the Nation in Blood. Moreover, that he would have aided me out of the Country, but I would not go; and therefore he committed me to Prison for want of Sureties for the good Behaviour, as the <HI>Mittimus</HI> declares.</Q> <HI>Now do not ye s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o plainly, that Major</HI> Ceely is guilty of this Plot and Treason that he talks of, and hath made himself a Party to it, by desiring me to go out of the Country, and demanding Bail of me; and not charging me with this pre∣tended Treason till now, nor discovering it? But I deny and abhor his Words, and am innocent of his devilish Design.</P>
<P>The Judge by this seeing clearly that <HI>Ceely,</HI> instead of ensnaring <HI>Fox,</HI> had ensnared himself, let fall that Business. But then <HI>Ceely</HI> got up again, and said to the Judge, <HI>If it please you,</HI> My Lord, <HI>to hear me: This Man struck me, and gave me such a Blow, as I never had in my Life. G. Fox</HI> smiling at this, said, <HI>Major</HI> Ceely, <HI>art thou a Justice of Peace, and a Major of a Troop of Horse, and tells the Judge here in the Face of the Court and Country, That I, who am a Prisoner, struck thee; and gave thee such a Blow, as thou never had'st the like in thy Life? What! Art thou not ashamed? Prithee, Major</HI> Ceely, <HI>where did I strike thee? And Who is thy Witness for that? Who was by?</HI> To this <HI>Ceely</HI> said, <HI>It was in the Castle-green,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Major <HI>Ceely</HI> calls Captain <HI>Bradden</HI> for Evidence, which he modestly re∣fuses.</NOTE> <HI>and that Captain</HI> Bradden <HI>was standing by, when</HI> G. Fox <HI>struck him.</HI> Who then desired the Judge to let him produce his Witness for That: And he called again upon <HI>Ceely, to come down from off the Bench;</HI> telling him, <HI>It was not fit that the Accuser should sit as Judge over the Accused. Ceely</HI> then said, <HI>Captain</HI> Bradden, <HI>was his Witness:</HI> Which made <HI>G. Fox</HI> say to Captain <HI>Bradden,</HI> who was present there, <HI>Didst thou see me give him such a Blow, and strike him, as he saith?</HI> Bradden made no Answer, but bowed his Head. <HI>G. Fox</HI> then desired him to <HI>speak up, if he knew any such Thing:</HI> But he only bowed his Head again. <HI>Nay,</HI> said G. Fox, <HI>Speak up, and let the Court and Country hear, and let not bowing of the Head serve the Turn. If I have done so, let the Law be inflicted on me?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prisoners at last fined 20 Marks a∣piece for not putting off their Hats, and re-com∣mitted.</NOTE> <HI>I fear not Sufferings, nor Death it self; for I am an innocent Man concerning all his Charge.</HI> But <HI>Bradden</HI> would not testify to it. And the Judge finding those Snares would not hold, cried, <HI>Take him away, Jailor;</HI> and fined the Prisoners twenty Marks a-piece, for not putting off their Hats, and to be kept in Prison till they paid the Fine: And so they were brought back to Jail again. At Night Captain <HI>Bradden</HI> came with seven or eight Justices to see them; and they being very civil, said, <HI>They did not believe that either the Judge, or any in the Court, be∣lieved those Charges with Major</HI> Ceely <HI>had charged upon</HI> G. Fox. And <HI>Bradden</HI> said, <HI>Major</HI> Ceely <HI>had an Intent to have taken away</HI> G. Fox's <HI>Life, if he could have got another Witness. But,</HI> said, G. Fox, <HI>Captain</HI> Bradden, <HI>Why didst not thou witness for me, or against me, seeing Major</HI> Ceely <HI>produced thee for a Witness, that thou sawest me strike him? And when I desired thee to speak either for me, or against me, according to what thou saw'st or knew'st, thou would'st not speak. Why,</HI> said he, <HI>when Major</HI> Ceely <HI>and I came by you, as you were walking in the</HI> Castle-green, <HI>he put off his Hat to you, and said,</HI> How do you, Mr. Fox? Your Servant, Sir. <HI>Then you said to him,</HI> <Q>Major <HI>Ceely,</HI> take heed of Hypocrisy, and of a rotten

Heart; for when came I to be thy Master, or thou my Servant?</Q> Do Servants use to cast their Masters into prison? <HI>This was the great Blow he meant that you gave him. G. Fox</HI> hearing this, called to Mind, that they walking by, <HI>Ceely</HI> had spoken the aforesaid Words, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he himself indeed made such an Answer as is mentioned; and he thought he said nothing amiss, since <HI>Ceely</HI> so openly had manifest∣ed his Hypocrisy and Rotten-heartedness, when he complained of this to the Judge in open Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Major <HI>Ceely</HI>'s wicked Shift.</NOTE> and would have made all believe, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> gave him a Stroke outwardly with his hand. A Report of this Trial being spread abroad, divers People, of whom some were of Account in the World, came far and near to see him and his Friends in Prison, which tended to the Convincement of some. Being settled in Prison upon such a Commitment, that they were not likely to be soon released, they forbore giving the Jailor seven Shillings a Week a-piece for themselves, and as much for their Horses, which he had in a Manner extorted from them: But upon this he grew so very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icked, that he turned them down into a nasty stinking Place, where they used to put Persons condemned for Witchcraft and Murder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Jailor's inhuman Be∣haviour to them.</NOTE> This Place was so noisome, that it was observed, few who went into it, did ever come out again in Health: For there was no House of Office in it, and the Excrements of the Prisoners, that from Time to Time had been put there, had not been carried out for many Years; so that it was all like Mire, and in some Places to the Top of the Shoes in Water and Piss; and the Jailor would not suffer them to cleanse it, nor let them have Beds or Straw to lie on. At Night some friendly People of the Town brought them a Candle, and a little Straw; of which they were about to burn a little to take away the Stink. The Thieves lay over their Heads, and the Head-Jailor in a Room by them over their Heads also. But it seems the Smoak went up into the Room where he lay, which put him into such a Rage, that he took the Pots of the Thieves Excrements, and poured them down thro' a Hole upon their Heads; whereby they were so bespattered, that it was loathsome to touch themselves, or one another: besides, the Stink so encreased, that by it, and the Smoak, they were almost in Danger of being suffocated. And all this could not satisfy the Rage of this cruel Jailor, but he railed against them so hideously, and called them by such horrible nick Names, that they never had heard the like before. In this Man∣ner they were forc'd to stand all Night, for they could not sit down, the Place being so filthy. Thus he kept them a great While, before he would let them c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it, or suffer them to have any Victuals brought in, but what they got thro' the Grate. And even this could not be done without Difficulty; for a Lass one Time having brought them a little Meat, he sued her in the Town-Court for breaking the Prison; perhaps, because she had a little bent an half-broken Bar of the Grate, to get a small Dish thro' it. That this Jailor was so desperately wicked, is not so much to be wondred at, since (as they were inform∣ed) he had been a Thief, and was on that Account burnt both in the Hand and on the Shoulder; and the Under-Jailor in like Man∣ner: Their Wives had also been burnt in the Hand. It was not at all strange then, that the Prisoners suffererd most grievously from such a wicked Crew: But it was more to be wondered at, that Colonel <HI>Bennet,</HI> a <HI>Baptist</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cher, having purchas'd the Jail and Lands belonging to the Castle, had there placed this Head Jailor. Twas much talk'd of, that Spirits haunted this Dungeon, and walk'd there, and that many had died in it; Some thinking to terrify the Prisoners therewith.

They also sent up a Relation of their Sufferings to the Protector; who thereupon sent down an Order to the Governor of <HI>Pendennis-Castle,</HI> to examine the Matter. On which Occasion <HI>Hugh Pe∣ters,</HI> one of the Protector's Chaplains, told him, <HI>They could not do</HI> George Fox <HI>a greater Service for the spreading of his Principles in</HI> Cornwal, <HI>than to imprison him there.</HI> This was not altogether untrue; for he was much visited, and many were turned from Darkness to the Light; notwith∣standing the Mayor of <HI>Lanceston</HI> was a fierce Persecutor, casting in Pri∣son all he could get;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mayor of <HI>Lanceston</HI> a fierce Perse∣cutor.</NOTE> and he did not stick to search substantial grave Women, as supposed, for Letters.

Many other Particulars (and among the rest that of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s striking Major <HI>Ceely</HI>) were also mentioned in this Letter. <HI>G. Fox</HI> him∣self wrote also several Papers, wherein the Odiousness of Persecution was plainly set forth. Among those that came to visit him was also <HI>Thomas Lower,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>T. Low∣er</HI> visits <HI>G.

But <HI>Cromwel</HI> said, <HI>He could not do it, for it was contrary to Law:</HI> And turning to those of his Council, <HI>Which of you</HI> (quoth he) <HI>would do so much for me, if I were in the same Condition?</HI> Thus <HI>G. Fox</HI> continu'd in Prison, and it was yet a good While before he and his Fellow-Prisoners were released. The Next Year the wicked Jailor received a Recompence of his Deeds; For he was turned out of his Place, and for some wicked Act was Cast into Jail himself; and there his Carriage was so unruly, that he

<P>About the same Time that <HI>G. Fox</HI> was released,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment call'd. <HI>S.

And after he had got the Conveniency of a Standing, he said, <HI>That he had a Word to speak from the Lord to the Protector, the Parliament and the People:</HI> And then he began thus:</P>
<P><Q>The Burden of the Word of the Lord God of Heaven and of Earth, as it came unto me on the 22d Day of the last Month, and as it now lieth upon me to declare it in his Name, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven unto thee <HI>Oliver Crom∣wel,</HI> Protector (so called) of these three Nations, <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and also to all you who are chosen out of the several Parts thereof to sit in Parliament this Day, to consider of such Things as concern the Commonwealth thereof; and likewise to the three Nations themselves, and all the People thereof whose Rulers and Re∣presentatives ye are: Which Word of the Lord, as ye do not deem your selves too high, or too great, or too good to be spoken to from the Lord, and as you will not fall under the Guilt of that Sin of say∣ing to the Seers, <HI>See not,</HI> and to the Prophets, <HI>Prophesy not, prophesy not unto us right Things, prophesy smooth Things, prophesy Deceits:</HI> I charge you all, in the Name of the living God; that without Interruption or Opposition, whether you like it, or like it not, you stand still and hear it; and when I have done, you may do with me as the Lord shall give you Leave, or leave me under the Power of your Hands to do; no Law of Equity condemning any Man before he be heard, especially when he speaks on so high an Account as from the God of Heaven himself, tho' to such as are no less than Gods un∣der him here on Earth.</Q></P>
<P>Scarce had he spoken thus much, but some cried, <HI>A Quaker! a Quaker! keep him down, he shall not speak:</HI> Yet the Protector and the Parliament-men were still and quiet. But some others, among whom two Justices of Peace, had not so much Patience; but <HI>Fisher,</HI> as he related afterwards, believed that the Protector and the Parliament-men would have given him Audience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is inter∣rupted.</NOTE> had not others set him at nought, some saying, <HI>The Pro∣tector had spoken long, and was very hot and weary; and that he</HI> [Fisher] <HI>might be ashamed to occasion his Stay any longer.</HI> Thus <HI>Fisher</HI> was interrupted, and the Protector and Parliament-men rising, went away; tho' <HI>Fisher</HI> did not question but the Protector would have heard him: For his Mode∣ration in hearing what was said, having been experienc'd before, <HI>Fisher</HI> was willing to acknowledge his Nobility as freely, as <HI>Paul</HI> took Notice of the like in <HI>Festus,</HI> whom he held most noble in that he would hear him, tho' he thought him mad.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He publishes his designed Speech, and some others be afterwards intended.</NOTE> <HI>Fisher</HI> being thus prohibited, pub∣lished his Speech in Print, so as he intended to have delivered it, tho' not one Syllable of it was written before. It was pretty long, and con∣tained a sharp Reproof to the Hypocrisy of those, who under a Shew of Godliness made long Prayers, kept Fasts, and nevertheless liv'd in Pride, Pomp, and Luxury, persecuting those who really were a pious

People. And to the Protector he said, <HI>That unless he took away the Wick∣ed from before him, and all flattering false Accusers, his Throne would never be established in Righteousness.</HI> In the Introduction plac'd before thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Speech, he saith, That before this Burden came upon him, he had prayed God that he might have been excused of this Message, think∣ing that a more unworthy one than himself could not have been singled out: But whatever he did, he could not be rid of it; and tho' he spent a whole Week with Fasting, Tears, and Supplication, yet during the Time of that Abstinence, he felt a daily Supply and Refreshmen to his Spirits, so that he fully resigned to do what he believed was required of him from the Lord; and he felt all Fears of the Frowns of Men re∣moved from him. Some other Speeches which he intended to have made to the Parliament, but was obstructed therein, he also published afterwards in Print.</P>
<P>In the latter Part of this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">H. Smith at Evesham.</NOTE> it happened that <HI>Humphrey Smith</HI> coming to <HI>Evesham</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> was disturbed in a Meeting by the Mayor <HI>Edward Young,</HI> who said, <HI>He would break the</HI> Quakers <HI>Meetings, or else his Bones should lie in the Dirt.</HI> Thus resolved, he came in the Month called <HI>October,</HI> on a First-Day of the Week in the Morning, into their Meeting in a House where <HI>H. Smith</HI> was; and several Persons, after be∣ing rudely abused,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is impri∣soned with o∣thers, and cruelly treat∣ed by the Mayor <HI>E. Young.</HI></NOTE> were haled out to Prison. In the Afternoon a Meeting being kept in the Street, some of the Company were by Order of the said Mayor put into the Stocks, and others, of which the afore∣said <HI>Smith</HI> was one, into a dark Dungeon: And tho' the Mayor then said, <HI>It was an unlawful Assembly; but if they would meet in Houses, he would not molest them;</HI> yet on the next First-Day of the Week, he seeing one going to a Meeting that was appointed in a House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cruelty.</NOTE> put him in Prison. <HI>H. Smith,</HI> and his Friends had some Bedding and Bed-cloaths sent them, but the Mayor caused it to be taken away from them; and when afterwards some Straw was brought them to lie upon, the Jailor would not suffer it; nay, when one came, and askt Liberty to fetch out their Dung from them, the Mayor denied it, and ordered him to be put in the Stocks. The Place where they were kept, was not 12 Foot Square, and the Hole to take in Air, was but four Inches wide, so that even by Day-light they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain to burn Candle, when they had it. Here they were kept above fourteen Weeks, with their own Dung in the same Room; so that one of them grew sick of the Stink; and yet the Jailor said, <HI>If they had been there for Theft or Murder, he could have let them have more Liberty than now he durst, because of the May∣or. James Wall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He hindred a Freeman's Wife of her Stand in the Market.</NOTE> one of the Prisoners, was a Freeman of the Town, and a Shop-keeper, and yet the Mayor forbad his Wife to stand in the Market-Place, which for many Years she had done.

Here they were kept about a Quarter of a Year, having nothing to lie on but some Straw. But this their Suffering had such Effect, that some of the Inhabitants seeing these unreasonable Dealings, began to enquire into the Doctrine held forth by the Suffer∣ers, and so came to be convinced of the Truth thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are re∣leased.

<P>From thence he went to the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A.

But there being an Opening at the Top of the Room, she could see People go along the Streets, and thus took Occasion from this Subterranean Cave, to preach to the Passengers with such Power and Efficacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There preach∣es from under Ground.</NOTE> that his Do∣ctrine entred into the Hearts of the Hearers, and stuck there.

And tho these were often hindred of having Meetings, yet it was impossible to stop up the Foun∣tain from whence their Words flowed. Thus it was also with <HI>A.

Under this Pretence, many who travelled to the Markets with their Goods, were seiz'd by the Way; for if it did but appear that such an one was a <HI>Quaker,</HI> which was presently seen by his not putting off his Hat, then there wanted no pretended Reason to clap him up in Prison.</P>

Ames</HI> found also some Recep∣tion among the <HI>Baptists</HI> there, who at first were pleased with him, but <HI>J. Stubs</HI> did not please them so well, as Dr. <HI>Galenus Abrahamson</HI> once told me, who compared <HI>Ames</HI> to a Musician that pray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a very melodi∣ous Tune, and <HI>Stubs</HI> to a Disturber of the harmonious Musick, tho' <HI>Ames</HI> afterwards for his great Zeal was found Fault with also. <HI>W. Caton</HI> now arrived at <HI>Dort,</HI> and from thence repaired to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where for Want of an Interpreter that understood <HI>English,</HI> he was fain to make Use of the <HI>Latin.</HI> But it grieved him exceedingly to meet with some unruly Spirits there, that having been in some Measure convinced by <HI>W Ames,</HI> ran out under the Denomination of <HI>Quakers,</HI> into Ex∣tremes, both in Words and Writings. Some of these Persons I know, and have seen also some of the Books they gave out in Print, in which, under a Pretence of Plainness, not one Capital Letter was to be found, even not to proper Names, nay, not to Names of Authors themselves. And since they ran out into several other Extravagancies, it was not much to be wondred, that the Magistrates clapt them up in <HI>Bedlam.</HI> The Ring-leader of these People was one <HI>Isaac Furnier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some extra∣vagant Peo∣ple disown'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <HI>Qua∣kers.</HI></NOTE> who formerly (as I have heard my Uncle tell, who had seen it himself) lived as another <HI>Diogenes,</HI> using at the Fire, instead of a Pair of Tongs, a split Stick; and now conversing among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, made it a Piece of Holiness to use the most blunt Language he could think of, how absurd and irregular soever. In fine, he so behaved himself, that the Orthodox <HI>Quakers</HI> could not resolve to keep Society with him any longer. He it was, as I have understood, who was the Author of that ridiculous Saying, <HI>My Spirit testifieth:</HI> Which, tho' not approved, nor used, by the true <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet hath been so spread among the People in the Low-Countries, that it hath been constantly credited, and is not yet quite disbelieved, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> use to say so of any Thing they intend to do; and that if any one, who ever it be, says so, they will give Credit to his Saying. The above-said Dr. <HI>Galenus</HI> hath told me, that this Man, coming to his Door, and finding the Doctor's Name writ on the Post of the Door (as is usual in <HI>Holland</HI>) did, with his Knife, scratch out the Letters <HI>Dr.</HI> signifying <HI>Doctor.</HI> On which the Doctor askt him, <HI>Why he did so?</HI> And his Answer was, <HI>Because the Spirit did testify so unto him.</HI> And being askt farther, <HI>If so be, that Spirit did move him to stab the Doctor with the Knife, whether he would follow that Motion.</HI> He answered, (if the Relation be true) as the Doctor affirmed to
<PB N="135" REF="003104_0146_0FEFF467A5374090"/>
me, <HI>Yes.</HI> But however it be, this is true, that this <HI>Furnier</HI> was a passi∣onate and giddy-headed Man, whom the true <HI>Quakers</HI> could not own, tho' he had translated many of their Books out of <HI>English</HI> into <HI>Dutch;</HI> and would also preach amongst them. But at length he left them, and turning Papist, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to a dissolute and debauch d Life.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>W. Caton;</HI> he coming to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>From</HI> Rotter∣dam, W.

Wherefore <HI>W.

But tho' thus hardly used, yet he felt his Strength increase, and so experienced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Mercies of God. It was in the Month called <HI>November,</HI> when he arrived at <HI>London,</HI> where he was kindly received by the Brethren: After some Stay there he went to <HI>Hampshire, Surrey, Suffex,</HI> and <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>Not long before this, <HI>G.

Afterwards being made willing, and going out with a Friend, not thinking then of a Jour∣ney, he was commanded to go into the West, not knowing what he was to do there; but when he came he had given him what to declare; and so he continu'd not knowing one Day what he was to do the next; and the Promise of God, that he would be with him, he found made good to him every Day. <HI>J.

He came to <HI>London</HI> towards the latter End of the Year 1654, or Beginning of 1655, and found there a Meeting of Friends, which had already been gather<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in that City by the Service of <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> and <HI>Francis Howgill,</HI> and there he preach'd in such an eminent Manner, that many admiring his great Gift, began to esteem him much above his Brethren, which as it brought him no Benefit, so it gave Occasion of some Difference in the Society;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>G.

<P>Now altho' several Persons of differene Perswasions being moved with Compassion towards <HI>Naylor,</HI> as a Man carried away by foolish Imagina∣tions, had offered Petitions to the Parliament on his Behalf, yet it was resolved not to read them till the Sentence was pronounced against him.</P>
<P>There lived then at <HI>London</HI> one <HI>Robert Rich</HI> a Merchant (a very bold Man) who wrote a Letter to the Parliament, wherein he shewed what was Blasphemy; and on the 15th or <HI>December</HI> several Copies thereof were deliver'd to particular Members; and in that which was given to the Speaker, these Words were written at the Bottom, <HI>If I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave Liberty of those that sit in Parliament, I do here attend at their Door, and am ready, out of the Scriptures of Truth, to shew, that not any Thing</HI> J. Naylor <HI>hath said or done, is Blasphemy,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Parliament, after Judgment was concluded, resolved that the Speaker should be authoriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to issue his Warrants to the Sheriffs of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> the Sheriff of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and Governour of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> to see the said Judgment put in Execution: But by some it was question<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, whether this was a sufficient Warrant, unless the Protector concurr'd in the Matter; but he seemed unwilling to meddle with it. The Thing being thus far agreed upon, <HI>J. Naylor</HI> was brought up to the Bar; when the Speaker Sir <HI>Thomas Widdrington</HI> was about to pronounce the afore∣mention'd Sentence, <HI>Naylor</HI> said, <HI>He did not know his Offence.</HI> To which the Speaker return'd, <HI>He should know his Offence by his Punishment.</HI> After Sentence was pronounced, tho' <HI>J. Naylor</HI> bore the same with great Pa∣tience, yet it seem'd he would have spoken something, but was denied Liberty; nevertheless was heard to say, with a compos'd Mind, <HI>I pray God he may not lay it to your Charge.</HI></P>
<P>The 18th of <HI>December, J. Naylor</HI> suffered Part of the Sentence; and after having stood full two Hours with his Head in the Pillory, was stript and whipt at a Cart's Tail, from <HI>Palace-Yard</HI> to the <HI>Old Exchange,</HI> and re∣ceiv'd three Hundred and Ten Stripes; and the Executioner should have given him one more (as he confess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the Sheriff) there being three Hundred and eleven Kennels, but his Foot s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipping, the Stroke fell upon his own Hand, which hurt him much. All this <HI>Naylor</HI> bore with so
<PB N="139" REF="003104_0150_0FEFF46EB694F620"/>
much Patience and Quietness, that it astonish'd many of the Beholders▪ tho' his Body was in a most pitiful Condition: He was also much hurt with Horses treading on his Feet, whereon the Print of the Nails were seen. <HI>R. Travers,</HI> a grave Person, who washed his wounds, in a Certificate which was presented to the Parliament, and afterward printed, says, <Q>There was not the Space of a Man's Nail free from Stripes and Blood from his Shoulders near to his Waste, his Right-Arm sorely stri∣ped, his Hands much hurt with Cords, that they bled, and were swelled. The Blood and Wounds of his Back did very little appear at first Sight, by Reason of Abundance of Dirt that covered them, till it was washed off.</Q> Nay, his Punishment was so severe, that some Judged his Sentence would have been more mild if it had been present Death: And it seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d indeed that there was a Party, who not being able to prevail so far in Parliament as to have him sentenced to Death, yet strove to the utmost of their Power to make him sink under the Weight of his Punishment; for the 20th of <HI>December</HI> was the Time appointed for Ex∣ecuting the other Part of his Sentence, <HI>viz.</HI> Boring thro' his Tongue, and stigmatizing in his Forehead; but by Reason of the most cruel Whipping, he was brought to such a low Ebb, that many Persons of Note, moved with Compassion, presented Petitions to the Parliament on his Behalf, who resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed him farther Punishment for one Week. During this Interval several Persons presented another Petition, in whicn are these Words: <Q>Your Moderation and Clemency in respiting the Punish∣ment of <HI>J. Naylor,</HI> in Consideration of his Illness of Body, hath re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reshed the Hearts of many Thousands in these Cities, altogether unconcern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in his Practice: Wherefore, we most humbly beg your Pardon that are constrained to appear before you in such a Suit, (not daring to do otherwise) that you would remit the Remaining Part of your Sentence against the said <HI>J. Naylor,</HI> leaving him to the Lord and to such Gospel Remedies as he hath sanctified; and we are persuaded you will find such a Course of Love and Forbearance more effectual to reclaim; and will leave a Zeal of your Love and Tenderness upon our Spirits,</Q></P>
<P><HI>And we shall pray,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Petition being presented at the Bar of the House, by about one Hundred Persons, on the Beha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the whole, was accordingly rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and debated by them; but not being, likely to produce the desired Effect, the Petitioners thought themselves in Duty and Conscience bound to address the Protector for remitting the remaining Part of the Sentence; who thereupon sent a Letter to the Parliament, which occasion'd some Debate in the House. But the Day for executing the remaining Part of the Sentence drawing near, the Petitioners made a second Address to the Protector. It was indeed very remarkable, that so many Inhabitants that were not of the Society of those call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Quakers,</HI> shew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d themselves so much concern'd in this Business; but to me it seems to have proceeded meerly from Compassion towards the Person of <HI>J. Naylor,</HI> whom they regarded as one that was rather fallen into Error thro' Inconsiderateness than to have been guilty of wilful Blasphemy, for then he would not have deserved so much Pity. But notwithstanding all these humble Petitions, the publick Preachers it seems prevailed so much with <HI>Crom∣wel,</HI> that he could not resolve to put a Stop to the intended Execution; for five of these Ministers, whom I find named thus, <HI>Caryl, Manton, Nye, Griffith,</HI> and <HI>Reynolds</HI> came on the 24th of <HI>December,</HI> by Order from the Parliament (as it was said) to <HI>Naylor,</HI> to speak with him concerning the Things for which he was detain'd, and would not permit either

Friend or other to be present in the Room, tho' a certain impartial or neutral Person desir'd it earnestly, but it was denied him; yet after the Conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

Who told him that he told those Ministers, <HI>That he saw they had an Intent to make him suffer (tho' innocent) as an Evil-doer, and therefore had denied any to be present that might be indifferent Judges betwixt them and him; and that therefore he should not say any Thing, unless what passed was wrote down, and a Copy thereof given him to keep, or left with the Jailor sign'd by them.</HI> This was by them consented to, and so they propounded several Questions unto him, and took his Answers in Writing: He far∣ther told, <HI>That they asked him if he was sorry for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Blasphemies that he was guilty of, and whether he did recant and renounce the same?</HI> To which his Answer was, <HI>What Blasphemies?

<P><PB N="141" REF="003104_0152_0FEFF4711136F798"/>By this it seems that <HI>Naylor,</HI> tho' still under some Cloud, yet was a little more clear in his Understading than before; but he was en∣countred by fierce Enemies, and therefore the Execution of his Sentence was not stopt, but perform'd on the 27th of <HI>December. Robert Rich,</HI> that forward Man, of whom something hath been mention'd already, was this Day at the Parliament-Door, from eight in the Morning till about eleven, crying variously to the Parliament-Men as they pass'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> To one whom he judg'd to be innocent, he said, <HI>He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God; for God is Love:</HI> And to another whom he thought to be swayed by Envy, he said, <HI>He that hates his Brother is a Manslayer, and he that hates his Brother is a Murderer.</HI> Some then thought that <HI>Naylor</HI> would not have suffered any farther Punishment, because many honourable Persons had attended the Parliament and the Protector on his Behalf: But <HI>Rich</HI> knowing how the Case stood, told the People, <HI>That the Innocent was going to suffer:</HI> And to some of the Parliament Men he cry'd, <HI>That he was clear from the Blood of all Men; and that he desired them to be so too.</HI> Then he went towards the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and got on the Pillory, held <HI>Naylor</HI> by the Hand while he was burned on the Forehead, and bored thro' the Tongue; and was not a little affected with <HI>Naylor</HI>'s Suffer∣ings, for he licked his Wounds, thereby as it seems to allay the Pain; and he led him by the Hand from off the Pillory. It was very re∣markable, that notwithstanding there might be many Thousands of People, yet they were very quiet, and few heard to revile him, or seen to throw any Thing at him: And when he was burning, the People both before and behind him, and on both Sides, with one Consent stood bare-headed, as seeming generally moved with Compass∣sion and Good-will towards him.</P>
<P>Many now rejoiced, seeing how some few among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as <HI>Rich,</HI> and the like Sort of People did side with <HI>Naylor,</HI> whilst the <HI>Quakers</HI> generally spoke against him and his Doings; for those who hop'd to see the Downfal ot them, signified not obscurely, That now Things went as they would have, since the <HI>Quakers</HI> (as they said) were divided among themselves.

This I judge to be written from the Imaginations, and a Fear struck me when I first saw it, and so I put it in my Pocket close, not intending any should see it; which they finding on one, spread it abroad, which the Simplicity of my Heart never owned. So this I deny also, that the Name of Christ Jesus was received instead of <HI>James Naylor;</HI> for that Name is to the Seed to all Generations; and he that hath the Son, hath the Name, which is Life and Power; the Salvation and the Ʋnction into which Name all the Children of Light are baptized. So the Name of Christ I confess before Men, which Name to me hath been a strong Tower in the Night and in the Day: And this is the Name of Christ Jesus, which I confess, the Son and the Lamb in the Seed where he speaks in Male and Female: But who hath not this in himself, hath not Life, neitheir can have by Idolizing my Person, or the Person of any Flesh, but in whom the Heir is born, and hath spoken, or doth speak; there must not be denied the mouth to speak by, who is Head over all, and in all his own, God blessed for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="003104_0154_0FEFF4735DAD61B0"/>And all those ranting wild Spirits, which then gathered about me in that Time of Darkness; and all their wild Actions and wicked words against the Honour of God, and his pure Spirit and People; I deny that bad Spirit, the Power and the Works thereof; and as far as I gave Advantage, thro' Want of Judgment, for that evil Spirit in any to arise, I take shame to my self justly; having formerly had Power over that Spirit, in Judgment and Discerning, wherever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was; which Darkness came over me thro' Want of Watchfulness and Obedience to the pure Eye of God, and diligently minding the Reproof of Life, which condemns the adulterous Spirit. So the Adversary got Advantage, who ceases not to seek to devour; and being taken captive from the true Light, I was walking in the Night where none can work, as a wandring Bird fit for a Prey. And if the Lord of all my Mercies had not rescu'd me, I had perished, for I was as one appointed to Death and Destruction, and there was none could deliver me. And this I confess, that God my be justified in his Judgment, and magnified in his Mercies without End, who did not forsake his Captive in the Night, even when his Spirit was daily provoked and grieved; but hath brought me forth to give Glory to his Name for ever. And it is in my Heart to confess to God, and before Men, my Folly and Offence in that Day: Yet were there many Things formed against me in that Day to take away my Life, and bring Scandal upon the Truth, of which I am not guilty at all; as that Accusation, as if I had committed Adultery with some of those Women who came with us from <HI>Exeter-Prison,</HI> and also those who were with me at <HI>Bristol</HI> the Night before I suffered there; of both which Accusations I am clear before God, who kept me in that Day both in Thought and Deed, as to all Women, as a Child, God is my Record. And this I mention in particular (hearing of some who still cease not to reproach therewith God's Truth and People) that the Mouth of Enmity might be shut from Evil-speaking, tho' this toucheth not my Conscience.</P>
<P>And that Report, as tho' I had raised <HI>Dorcas Erbury</HI> from the Dead car∣nally, this I deny also, and condemn that Testimony to be out of the Truth; tho' that Power that quickens the Dead, I deny not, which is the Word of eternal Life. And this I give forth, that it may go as far as the Offence against the Spirit of Truth hath gone abroad, that all Burdens may be taken off with the Truth, and the Truth cleared thereby, and the true Light, and all that walk therein, and the Deeds of Darkness be condemned; and that all that are in Darkness, may not act in the Night, but stay upon God, who dwells in the Light, who with the Workers of Iniquity hath no Fellowship; which had I done, when first Darkness came upon me, and not been led by others, I had not run against the Rock to be broken, which so long had born me, and of whom I had so largely drunk, and of which I now drink in Measure; to whom be the Glory of all, and to him must every Tongue confess, as Judge and Saviour, God over all, blessed for ever.</P>
<P><HI>The Author adding to this an Exhortation to the Reader, how to behave himself, if at any Time he came to be tempted to Sin; and also a Warning not to rely too much on Gifts, Wisdom, and Know∣ledge, concludes thus:</HI></P>
<P>This I have learned in the Deep, and in secret, when I was alone; and now declare openly in the Day of thy Mercy, O Lord; Glory to the Highest for ever∣more, who hath thus far set me free to praise his Righteousness and his Mercy; and to the eternal, invisible, pure God, over all, be Fear, Obedience, and Glory evermore. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

And after I was led out from them, the Lord God of my Life sent divers of his Servants with his Word after me, for my Return; all which was rejected; yea, the Provocati∣on of that Time of Temptation was exceeding great against the pure Love of God; yet he left me not; for after I had given my self under that Power, and Darkness was above, my Adversary so prevailed, that all Things were turned and perverted against my right Seeing or Ʋnderstanding; only a secret Hope and Faith I had in my God which I had served, that he would bring me thro' it, and to the End of it, and that I should again see the Day of my Redemption from under it all; and this quieted my Soul in my greatest Tribulation.</HI></P>
<P>The Author moreover seriously exhorting others who also might come to fall into great Temptation, concludes with these Words: <HI>He who hath saved my Soul from Death thus far, and lift my Feet up out of the Pit, even to him be immortal Glory for ever, and let every troubled Soul trust in him; for his Mercy endureth for ever.</HI></P>

<P>IT is in my Heart to praise thee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduction to <HI>J.

When I was as altogether helpless, when Tribulation and Anguish was upon me Day and Night, and the Earth without Foundation; when I went on the Way of Wrath,

and passed by the Gates of Hell; when all Comforts stood afar off, and he that is mine Enemy had Dominion; when I was cast into the Pit, and was as one appointed to Death; when I was between the Milstones, and as one crushed with the Weight of his Adversary; as a Father thou wast with me, and the Rock of thy Presence. When the Mouth of Lions roared against me, and Fear took Hold of my Soul in the Pit, then I called upon thee in the Night, and my Eyes were strong before thee daily, who answered me from thy Habitation, and delivered me from thy Dwelling-Place, saying, I will set thee above all thy Fears, and lift up thy Feet above the Head of Oppres∣sion. I believed and was strengthned, and thy Word was Salvation. Thou didst fight on my Part when I wrestled with Death; and when Darkness would have shut me up, then thy Light shone about me, and thy Banner was over my Head: When my Work was in the Furnace, and as I passed thro' the Fire by thee, I was not consumed, tho' the Flames ascended above my Head. When I beheld the dreadful Visions, and was amongst the fiery Spirits, thy Faith stayed me, else thro' Fear I had fallen. I saw thee, and believed, so the Enemy could not prevail.</P>
<P>When I look back into thy Works, I am astonished, and see no End of thy Praises: Glory, Glory to thee, saith my Soul, and let my Heart be ever filled with Thanksgiving. Whilst thy Works remain, they shall shew forth thy Power. Then didst thou lay the Founda∣tion of the Earth, and lead me under the Waters, and in the Deep didst thou shew me Wonders, and thy Forming of the World. By thy Hand thou led'st me in Safety, till thou shewedst me the Pillars of the Earth: Then did the Heavens shower down, they were covered with Darkness, and the Powers thereof were shaken, and thy Glory descended: Thou fillest the lower Parts of the Earth with Gladness, and the Springs of the Valleys were opened, and thy Showers descen∣ded abundantly. So the Earth was filled with Virtue. Thou makest thy Plant to spring, and the thirsty Soul become as a watered Garden: Then didst thou list me out of the Pit, and set me forth in the Sight of my Enemies. Thou proclaimedst Liberty to the Captive, and called mine Acquaintance near me: They to whom I had been a Wonder, looked upon me, and in thy Love I obtained Favour in those who had forsook me. Then did Gladness swallow up Sorrow, and I forsook all my Troubles; and I said, How good is it that Man be proved in the Night, that he may know his Folly, that every Mouth may become silent in thy Hand, until thou make Man known to himself, and have slain the Boaster, and shewed him the Vanity that vexeth thy Spirit,</P>

<P>This plainly appears to be a Poetical Piece; for the Author all along makes Use of Allegorical Sayings, to signify the great Anguish and Tri∣bulation he had been under.</P>
<P>The Hatred of his Enemies was the fiercer, because he had undis∣guisedly and clearly demonstrated their Duty to the Rulers and Preach∣ers, and Lawyers: For in a certain Book published by him in the Year 1653, to exhort Men to Repentance, he writes thus to the Rulers:</P>
<Q><P>O You Rulers of the People, who are set up to judge between a Man and his Neighbour, ought not you to judge for God, and not for Man? Ought not you to be Men fearing God, and hating Covetousness, not judging for Gifts and Re∣wards? Ought not you to countenance and encourage them that do well, and be
<PB N="146" REF="003104_0157_0FEFF4BA9E593DC8"/>
a Terror to them which do Evil? Justice is so. And he that is of God, and bears his Sword, turns the Edge of it against all Sin and Wickedness, Injustice and Oppression, and so sets up Jusitce and Judgment in the Gates, that the Poor may be deliver'd from him that is too mighty for him, and that the Cause of the Fatherless, Widow and Stranger may not fall; but hath an Ear open to the Cries of the Poor and Helpless, who hath but little Money, and few Friends; that a poor Man may not be afraid to appear in a good Cause, against the great∣est Oppressor in the Nation.</P>
<P>And ought not you to judge without Respect to Persons, or without seeking Res∣pect to your own Persons, Worship or Honour from Men, but only to advance Ju∣stice, Equity, and Righteousness, which is of God, that so you may be honour'd by the Lord? for true Humility is Honour, and he that honours the Lord, him will he honour; and such hath been honour'd in all Ages, tho' they never sought it from Men.</P></Q>
<P>This and much more he wrote to the Rulers. And to the Preachers thus:
<Q>And you who say, you are the Teachers of the Nation, How long will it be ere you look at your own Ways? Is not all Manner of Filthiness a∣mongst you, which you should lead the People out of? Is there not among you Drunkenness, Gluttony, Whoredom, and Sporting, Sitting down to eat and to drink, and rising up to play; Swearing, Lying, Backbiting, false Accusing, Railing, Slandering, Contention, Strife and Envy? Yea, are not the best of you given to Pride and Covetousness, which is Idolatry, Fulness of Bread, and Abundance of Idleness? Are not you Hirelings, and teach for the Fleece? Do not you contend for Money with your own Hearers, and sue them at Law for it; yea, altho' they cannot satisfy your Demand, without sinning against the Light in their own Conscience, and so sin against God? Are you not bitter, and Persecutors of any that come to discover your Lewdness, crying out to the Magistrate to uphold you in your beastly Ways, and to stop the Mouths of all those whom God hath sent to witness against you? And many more Works of this Nature are among you, which the pure All-seeing God hath shewed unto his People to be amongst you; and therefore it is that they come out from you, lest they partake with you of your Sins and Plagues. But are not you blind Leaders of the blind, when you neither see these to be the Works of Dark∣ness, nor those that follow you. Woe unto you that devour Souls for Money and Gain, the Day of your Account is at Hand. O repent, the Blood of Souls is upon you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Lawyers in the same Writing had a Stroke also, thus:
<Q>And you Lawyers, ought not you to plead the Cause of Equity between Man and Man for Equity Sake, without Respect to your selves or others, but only to Truth it self, that a just Cause may be owned in whomsoever it concerns? But is not the justest Cause sure to fall, if the Party have not Money to satisfy your De∣mands, which are many Times very unreasonable? And you who should instruct People in the Ways of Truth and Peace, do not you by your Wisdom teach them Lies and Strife? Do not you advise your Plantiffs, as you call them, to declare in Bills, Things that are not true, and make small Offences seem very great by false Glosses? For say you, <HI>We may declare what we will, and prove what we can;</HI> so that you, and they whom you act for, know before hand, that scarce one Thing of Ten can be proved, neither is true? Is this the Way to <HI>make up the Breach, and preserve Peace and Truth among People?</HI> O miserable Fall from God, when that Law which should before pre∣serve in Peace, is used to aggravate Offences beyond Truth, and so make Differences greater. And do not you delight to fish in troubled Waters; and
<PB N="147" REF="003104_0158_0FEFF47A59E161A8"/>
the greater Dissention amongst the People, the more is your Gain? Are not your Purses filled, and your Estates raised in the Ruins of the People? And are not those Laws which ought to be used to preserve People from Oppression, by abusing, made the Ʋndoing of whole Families, impoverishing Towns and Countries? The Law, as it is now used, is scarce serviceable for any other End but for the envious Man, who hath much Money to revenge himself of his poor Neighbours, which, may be, never did him Wrong? Is there any ap∣pearing for the Poor against the Rich, altho' his Cause be just, but by Deceit, Delays and Expences; the Remedy is worse than the Disease?</Q></P>
<P>Much more he wrote to the Lawyers, to stir 'em up to do Justice, and then addressed himself to the People in general, in these Words,</P>
<P><Q>And you People of the Nation, that have seen the Hand of God, against the Prince and People for these and the like Abominations, and you your selves are escaped, as Brands placked out of the Fire; have you at all turned to him who hath smitten you? Or are you better'd by Correction? Or have you made your Peace with the Al∣mighty? Altho' you have seen War, and the Sword reaching to the very Soul, are you not every one to your own Power, gathering Fuel to that Fire which hath been burning in the Land, and hath con∣sumed Thousands; which should have been as a Warning unto you who are escaped, to return to the Lord from the Evil of your Doings? But are not you still making the Breach wider between God and the Nation, as tho' you were le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for no other End, but to fill up the Measure of Iniquity that is yet behind, that the Just God may sweep the Land with the Besom of Destruction? O when will you cease to provoke the Lord by your Sins? Where is your Redeemer you have professed so long in Words and Forms? Can you witness him in your Works? And what hath he redeemed you from? For saith he, <HI>Why call you me Lord, and do not the Things which I say?</HI> Is he your Lord, and you Servants to all Manner of Filthi∣ness? And notwithstanding that you have seen his Wonders in the Nation, yet do not you exceed all that ever went before you, in Pride, Covetousness, Drunkenness, Swearing, Envying, Quarrelling, Backbiting, Slandering, false Accusing, Self-Love, and Deceit in all Manner of Merchandize and Trading; false Weights and Measures, Sayings, Protestings one towards another, in your Bargaining, speak∣ing Things that are not true, and hereby to over-reach your Bre∣thren, and get dishonest Gain. How many false Oaths, and idle Words are spent about every Bargain in your Markets, and open Streets, without blushing, or being ashamed? Yea, it is able to break the Hearts of any who know the Pure God, to know it, and hear it, for it is come to such a Height of Deceit, that none can trust his Brother; for Lying, Swearing, and Forswearing, it abounds in the Nation; and yet you will profess your selves to be the Members of Jesus Christ: And had Jesus Christ ever such a Body as this? Nay, all that are Members of him, are of one Heart, and one Soul. And you talk of a Communion of Saints; Had ever the Saints such a Communion as this, to defraud one another for Money; and pro∣fess a Redeemer, and are Servants to the Devil, and your own Lusts, in all the Motions and Temptations thereof, and are led cap∣tive at his Will? But what Redemption is this you witness, so long as Sin, the Partition-Wall, is between God and you, stands still whole in your Wills; you will be drunk, swear, lye, and commit Adultery, di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>semble, and satisfy your Lusts in all Things, and say, we
<PB N="148" REF="003104_0159_0FEFF4BE0E0A44D0"/>
are redeemed, yet commit all these Abominations, and live in them, under a Pretence of a Profession, and going to the Idols Temple once a Week: Did ever Jesus Christ redeem such a People, or dwell in such a People? Those whom he hath redeemed, he hath freed from the Servitude of Sin, by separating them from Sin, and recon∣ciling them to God, from whence they are fallen by Sin; for God and Sin cannot dwell in one. And to such he saith, <HI>Be ye holy, for I am holy:</HI> And as he is the <HI>Lamb of God who taketh away the Sins of the World:</HI> Now see, how is your Sins taken away, when the Kingdom, of Darkness doth wholly rule in you, and leads you into Works and Ways of Darkness? Are you reconciled to God, and have you Fel∣lowship with him? Are not you yet Strangers to him, and worship an unknown God? <HI>For he that commits Sin, hath not seen him, neither known him,</HI> and so worship they know not what, in formal and super∣stitious Worships.</Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>J. Naylor</HI> wrote: But I now break off, that I may not be te∣dious.</P>
<P>So zealous was he before his Fall, which was wholly of another Nature than the common Sins and Transgressions: For by the Wiles of Satan he accepted the idolatrous Honour that some Persons gave him, instead of which he ought to have reproved them: And thus was he so stupified in his Understanding, that he imagin'd the Bow∣ing and kneeling before him, was not done on Account of his Person, but for Christ: And with this false Opinion he blinded himself for a Time, till it pleas'd God to pity him, and to give him Light again, after he had suffer'd such an unheard of Punishment for his Trans∣gression, as is already related in this History. And because his Free∣dom of Speech against Unrighteousness of all Sorts, and his Preach∣ing ran very sharp upon all, several were angry with him, became his Enemies, and took Occasion from his Crime to revenge themselves fiercely upon him, by making him suffer a cruel Punishment, which was no Ways proportionable to his Transgression. But herein barba∣rous Cruelty plaid its Part so much, that the soberest Inhabitants did detest it, and therefore a Petition was presented to the Parliament, de∣siring a Discharge of Part of the Punishment, of which, the first Subscriber was Colonel <HI>Scroop,</HI> who was Governor of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>While he lay in the House of Correction, he wrote several Papers to manifest his Regret and Repentance for his Crime; some of which are already inserted in this History. Since is come to my Hand a Letter to his Friends, being written with his own Hand, to this Purport:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Heart is broken this Day for the Offence I have occasion'd to God's Truth and People, and especially to you, who in dear Love followed me, seeking me in Faithfulness to God; which I re∣jected, being bound wherein I could not come forth, till God's Hand brought me, to whose Love I now confess: And I beseech you, for∣give wherein I evilly requited your Love in that Day. God knows my Sorrow for it, since I see it, That ever I should offend That of God in any, or reject his Counsel; and now that Paper you have seen lies much upon me, and I greatly fear farther to offend, or do amiss, whereby the innocent Truth, or People of God should suffer, or that I should disobey therein.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="003104_0160_0FEFF47D98070040"/>Unless the Lord himself keep you from me, I beseech you let nothing else hinder your coming to me, that I might have your Help in the Lord: In the Mercies of Christ Jesus this I beg of you, as if it was your own Case, let me not be forgotten of you.</P>
<P>And I entreat you, speak to <HI>Henry Clarke,</HI> or whoever else I have most offended; and by the Power of God, and in the Spirit of Christ Jesus I am willing to confess the Offence, that God's Love may a∣rise in all Hearts, as before, if it be his Will, who only can re∣move what stands in the Way; and nothing thereof do I intend to cover: God is Witness herein.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>He wrote also several other Confessions of his Faults about this Time; in one of which, amongst others, I find these Words:</P>
<P><Q>And concerning you, the tender Plants of my Father who have suffered thro' me, or with me, in what the Lord hath suffered to be done with me, in this Time of great Trial and Temptation; the Almighty God of Love, who hath numbred every Sigh, and put every Tear in his Bottle, reward it a thousand Fold into your Bosoms, in the Day of your Need, when you shall come to be tri∣ed and tempted; and in the mean Time fulfil your Joy with his Love, which you seek after. The Lord knows, it was never in my Heart to cause you to mourn, whose Sufferings is my greatest Sorrow that ever yet came upon me; for you are innocent herein.</Q></P>
<P>When he had finish'd that Letter, and set his Name, he wrote as follows:</P>
<P><Q>I beseech you (all that can) to receive it, even as you would be received of the Lord; and for the rest, the Lord give me Patience to suffer, till he make up the Breach.</Q></P>
<P>While he was in <HI>Bridewel,</HI> he writ to the Parliament, who had punish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him as a Blasphemer, to let them know what his true Opi∣nion concerning Jesus Christ was.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>CHRIST Jesus, the <HI>Immanuel,</HI> (of whose Sufferings the Scrip∣tures declare) him alone I confess before Men; for whose Sake I have denied whatever was dear to me in this World, that I might win him, and be found in him, and not in my self, whose Life and Virtue I find daily manifest in my mortal Body (which is my eternal Joy and Hope of Glory) whom alone I seek to serve in Spirit, Soul, and Body, Night and Day, (according to the Measure of Grace working in me) that in me he may be glorified, whether by Life or Death; and for his Sake I suffer all Things, that he alone may have the Glory of my Change, whose Work a∣lone it is in me: Even to that eternal Spirit be Glory, and to the Lamb for ever. </P>
<P>But to ascribe this Name, Power, and Virtue to <HI>James Naylor,</HI> (or to that which had a Beginning, and must return to Dust) or for that to be exalted or worshipped, to me is great Idolatry, and with the Spirit of Christ Jesus in me it is condemned; which Spirit leads to Lowliness, Meekness, and Long-suffering.</P>
<P>So having an Opportunity given (with Readiness) I am willing in tho Fear of God the Father, (in Honour to Christ Jesus, and to take off all Offences from every simple Heart) this to declare to all the World, as the Truth of Christ is in me, without Guile or Deceit,

<P>And as touching the printing of that Paper (called <HI>J.

<P>Therefore, so far as it testifies against those unclean ranting Spirits, and all the Actions wherein the Holy Name of God hath been dishonoured, and his Spi∣rit grieved, so far I own it; but in that it is turned as tho' I denied the Lord Jesus Christ and his Truth, which hath called me out of the World, or his Peo∣ple whom he hath called into Light, in that I own it not; for in the Patience and Tribulation of Christ Jesus, and with those who have the Power this Day to testifie therein, against all the Evils of this present World, I am one in Heart and Soul to the utmost of my Strength, till the Coming of the Lord Jesus over all, and the Throne of Meekness and Truth to be set on the Top of Enmity and Deceit; in which Faith and Power I am given up to live or die, suffer or re∣joice, as God will, even so be it, without murmuring.</P>

<P>This is certain, that <HI>James Naylor</HI> came to very great Sorrow, and deep Humiliation of Mind; and therefore because God forgives the Transgressions of the Penitent, and blotteth them out, and remem∣breth them no more, so could <HI>James Naylor</HI>'s Friends do no other than forgive his Crime, and thus take back the lost Sheep into their Society.

<P>I say then, what is become of your spiritual Weapons? Have not your Teachers told People of the Strength of Truth, and the Pow∣er of Godliness? Have you lost both (may Wisdom say) and run you now to the Arm of Flesh, to get <HI>Errors stifled</HI> (as you call them) or else your Hope is lost, and your Faith fails you? Did ever any of Christ's Ministers leave their spiritual Weapons, to run to the Arm of Flesh, or a carnal Weapon to stop Seducers? I say, No; this they never did, but with spiritual Weapons they wrestled and overcame spiritual Wickedness, and with them cut down Heresies, Blasphemies, and false Worships, and cleared the Churches of Christ of them, and drove them down before them in the World: <HI>For none could resist the Spirit by which they spoke,</HI> of all the false Priests, and false Worshippers: But being put to the worst, they cried (as you do) to Rulers and Peo∣ple, <HI>Help us, or all will be over-run: For they that turn the World upside down are come hither;</HI> [Mind your Cry.] And then the rude Multi∣tude ran on Heaps upon them, and made Tumults often, and fell upon them with Staves and Fists, and assaulted the Houses that en∣tertain'd them, as you do, and so haled them before Rulers, who took their Part herein, and put them in Prison, and often whipp'd them, unless it were some that were so noble, as not to heed the Cry of the Multitude; but would hear their Cause, and give them Leave to speak, before they would sentence them that were accused. And this was the Nobility of Heathen Kings and Rulers; and do not you seek to make <HI>England</HI>'s Rulers worse than them; Beware lest Heathens rise up in the Day of Judgment against them who are cal∣led Christians, and condemn them.</P>
<P>And in this your Cry for Help, against so contemptible a People (as you count them) you (like silly Women) do but discover your Weakness and Worthlesness; and if God open the Eyes of King <HI>Charles,</HI> he will see it. What! Have you preached and wrestled your selves out of all Hope and Faith, that either you must have sudden Help from him, or all is lost and over-run? Surely it may be said, you have been bad Watchmen, and idle Shepherds, who have lost all, if sudden Help come not from another Hand. Now if any had come against you with carnal Weapons, then had you had some Excuse in crying to the Earthly Powers; but in that, nothing but Spirit comes against Spirit, and yet you have lost the Day. This doth clearly manifest, that the Power of God you have not in you, but have lost the Kingdom of the Most High, and so are become unreasonable Men, who would have two Weapons against one, and another to do your Work for you, and yet are unwilling to forgo your Wages; yea, this Advantage you have had divers Years, but have not pre∣vailed therewith.</P>

<P>And whereas you now say, <HI>That none but a Regal Authority can stifle;</HI> It's true, you have tried Parliaments and Protectors (as you called them) and Parliaments again; and to make them then work for you, your Priests used these Arguments to them, (to wit,) <HI>That in the late Wars they had exposed Lives, Liberties, Estates, and Relations, with all other personal Advantages, in maintaining the just Proceedings of Parliaments,</HI> and from them you then claimed our <HI>Stifling,</HI> as the Price of your <HI>Prayers, Purses, Hazards, Losses, Banishment</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> as may be read in the <HI>Westmorland</HI> Petition against us, which thou hast printed in Page 197, and 198. And was not this Power that which you then called the <HI>common Enemy,</HI> in the same Petition, <HI>p.</HI> 200, which you now cry to, and would put him upon that Work against us now, as Defender of your Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ah! faithless Generation have you been to God and Man, may you not be ashamed of this Work, to print it and send it to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and call him to defend it, and patronize it: How hath Envy bereaved you of your Reasonableness? Shall he who defends this, defend either Faith or Truth? But this is that you may cover your selves with your Shame and Envy, that both King and People, and Parliaments, may see what a Generation you are, that will run under any Power to get your bloody Ends; but indeed true to none; for if it was true, that you were so faith∣ful to that Parliament, with your Prayers, Purses, and Blood, as there you plead, then is your Faith but new, which now you would have defended; but if not true, then how great Deceivers, and how little to be trusted, or defended in your cruel Designs.</P>

<HEAD>In Answer to the BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>THE Day is come that the Scripture is fulfilled, which the Lord spoke by his Prophet, <HI>Isa. xliv.</HI> 25. That he will <HI>make the Diviners mad;</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="003104_0164_0FEFF48242675758"/>
and that <HI>the Prophets shall be ashamed, every one of his Vision,</HI> Zach. <HI>xiii. 4.</HI> The which doth now evidently appear, and their <HI>Folly is made ma∣nifest unto all</HI> that will see and behold it, according to 2 <HI>Tim. iii. 9.</HI> And is not this manifest Madness and Folly in them, called Orthodox and Divines, to present unto the King their Packet of Lies, which have been seven Years told over, and so long since disproved and confuted, as may be seen in a Book called, <HI>Saul's Errand to Damascus,</HI> &amp;c. printed in the Year 1653, and in several other Books since. It already hath been, and is now manifest unto all Men of sober Ʋnderstandings, that these Men, falsely called Orthodox and Divines, have had no Defence, either to vindicate themselves, or disprove the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> but this Refuge of Lies, which they first presented to the Par∣ment sitting in <HI>1652,</HI> and likewise to other Parliaments which have been since that Time, and to the two Protectors, and now to this present King is direct∣ed; and you presumptuously charge him to be the Patron to it, requiring him to defend those Lies which you falsely call the Faith. But this we know, ac∣cording as it is written, <HI>Prov. xxix. 12, 19.</HI> That <HI>if a Ruler hearken to Lies, all his Servants are wicked; but a wise King scattereth the Wicked, and bringeth the Wheel over them.</HI></P>
<P>These pretended Divines, are such as have bowed and crouched under eve∣ry Appearance of a Power, and by Flatteries seem to cleave unto them, that they might uphold, maintain, and satisfy their God, which is their Bellies: These were of them which said, that <HI>Oliver Cromwel was the Light of their Eyes, and the Breath of their Nostrils:</HI> So that now with Shame they might rather confess that they are blind, and dead (from the Light and Life of God) than to multiply Lies in their accustomed Manner as formerly. These also were of them that said, <HI>Oliver Cromwel was Moses, who had led them into a Sight of the good Land;</HI> and that <HI>Richard</HI> his Son was <HI>Joshua, which should lead them into the Pos∣session.</HI> But we with many more, do see that their Hope is false, and their Faith also proved vain, and they are not yet in the <HI>Land of Promise;</HI> for there no Liars come. And those former Rulers hearkening to their Lies, were deceived by them, which was the Cause of God's Judgments, and utter De∣struction coming upon them; which while they put into the Priests Mouths, they cried, <HI>Peace</HI> unto them, calling them <HI>Moses, Aaron,</HI> and <HI>Joshua;</HI> but when they ceased, and could not put into their Mouths, then they cried out, that <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI> were <HI>Tyrants</HI> and <HI>Oppressors:</HI> And so will they do unto the King now, who are seeking to cleave unto him by Flattery and Deceit; which if he deny to be the Patron and Defender of their Lies, will be apt to cry as much against him. So that he, or they, are blessed, whose Ears are not open to their Clamours, but whose Hearts are joined to the Truth, and who are led by the Spirit of God as their Instructor; for such shall discern Hypocrites, and false Hearted Men, under every Pretence of Flattery or Dissimulation; for the <HI>Folly</HI> of these begins to <HI>be manifest un∣to all Men,</HI> 2 Tim. <HI>iii. 9.</HI></P>
<P>Now as in Answer to the History, concerning <HI>John Toldervey,</HI> asserted by a Company of Priests, as <HI>Brooks, Cocking, Goodwin, Jenkins, Ja∣comb, Alderry, Tombs,</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> whom themselves say, that they have but perused a Part, as <HI>Page 99,</HI> and yet pretend to witness the whole; whose Witness is disproved and denied by the said <HI>John Toldervey,</HI> both by his own Book given forth from him, and by his Life and Conversati∣on, being now <HI>(since his Return from his Out-going)</HI> a living Wit∣ness, not against, but for the Way, Doctrine, Principle, and Practice, which the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> do live in, against those Lies published abroad concerning him.</P>
<P>And as for thy Charge thou hast against <HI>J. Naylor,</HI> thro' the everlast∣ing Mercy of my God, I have yet a Being among the Living, and Breath to answer for my self, tho' against the Intents of many cruel bloody Spi∣rits,
<PB N="154" REF="003104_0165_0FEFF4C5DA4F5230"/>
who pursued my Soul unto Death (as much as in them lay) in that Day of my Calamity, when my Adversary was above, and wherein I was made a Sign to a backsliding Generation, who then would not see nor hear what now is com∣ing upon them, but rejoiced against this Piece of Dust, and had little Pity to∣wards him that was fallen into their Hands; wherein God was just in giving me up for my Disobedience, for a little Moment, as a Father to correct; yet should not they have sought to aggravate Things against me, as thou dost; for it was a Day of deep Distress, and lay sore upon my Soul, and the merciful God saw it, who, tho' he was displeased for a Time, yet his Thoughts were not to cast off for ever <HI>(but extend Mercy)</HI> as it is at this Day, Glory be to his Name, from my delivered Soul, eternally.</P>
<P>And in that Day there were many Spirits flock'd about me, and some whom, while the Candle of the Lord shone upon my Head, I ever judged and kept out from me, who then got up and acted, and spoke several Things not in the Light and Truth of God, by which they, who sought Occasion against me, were then strengthened to afflict this Body; and he that watches for Evil, in thee and some others, makes Ʋse on still against God's Truth and innocent People; whose Mouths the God of my Mercy stop, and so finish the Trouble of my Heart as to that Thing, for my Soul hath long dwelt among Lions, even among them that are set on Fire, <HI>whose Teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their Tongues a sharp Sword, speaking mischievous Things to shed Blood.</HI></P>
<P>But O Man, or Men, whoever you be, whose Work it is to gather the Fail∣ings of God's People in the Time of Temptation, or Night of their Trial, and aggravate them, and add thereto the Wickedness and mischievous Lies of your own Hearts, as thou hast done in thy Book, and then come out with those against God's everlasting holy Truth, it to reproach; I say, you are set on work by an evil Spirit, and you do but shew your selves to be Enemies to God and his Children; and it is our Sorrow, that any of us should give such Spirits Occasion to blaspheme; and it hath been Trouble of Soul to all the People of God, that have ever loved Righteousness, when they have thus occasioned the Joy of the Wicked, or to feed the Man that watches for Iniquity, and feeds on Mischief: Yet know this, you that are of that Brood, God will not cast off his People; tho' he be sometimes provoked to correct them, even before their Adversaries,(which is a Sign to them) yet is his Anger but for a Moment, and his Favour shall <HI>return as Streams of Life;</HI> then shall the <HI>Food be taken out of the Mouth of the Viper, and the Prey from between the Teeth of the Devourers;</HI> and God will feed them with their own Vomit, and the Poison that hath long lain under their Tongues, shall be bitter in their own Bowels. Thus will God certainly <HI>plead with</HI> Zion<HI>'s Enemies, as he bends her Sons for himself, and God will make up her Breaches:</HI> And this hath my Soul seen, <HI>Jacob's Captivity restored, and the Diggers of the Pit are fal∣len therein;</HI> neither hath he smitten him as he smote them that smote him, nor is he slain according to the Slaughter of them that are slain by him; but this is all <HI>His Fruit to purge away his Sin.</HI></P>
<P>So he that had long watched for my faltering, then got Advantage against me; yet had I then Power to bear his utmost Envy, thro' <HI>Christ Jesus, whom I then confessed before Men,</HI> who then was my Support in all, and under all, and who is over all, blessed for ever of all who have proved him in the Depth.</P>
<P>But that which was, and is the Sorrow of my Heart, is the Advantage the Enemy then took against the Name of Christ, his Truth, and his despised Peo∣ple, in that Time of Temptation, which is that which thou art now pursuing with Hatred and Lies, as <HI>That I was suspected to have a Woman in Bed with me, the Night before I suffered at</HI> Bristol, when there were six or seven Persons in the Room that Night, and a Man (to wit) <HI>Robert Rich</HI> in Bed with me. But this, and several other false things thou hast written in thy Book, of which I am clear before the Lord, so they touch me not at all; nor shall I here mention them against thee in particular; but to God alone I look, in his
<PB N="155" REF="003104_0166_0FEFF484E71D9490"/>
Time to be cleared from all Offences in his Sight, who only knows my Heart in this Thing, in whose Presence I can say, that nothing is more odious and bur∣densome to my Soul, than that any of the Glory or Worship which belongs to God, or to Christ, should be given to Flesh and Blood, in my self, or others: And how it was with me at that Day, many talk of, but few know; so the Judg∣ment of such I bear; desiring that none in judging me, might have condemned themselves in God's Sight, whose <HI>Counsels are a great Deep, and the End of his Work past finding out,</HI> till he himself reveal them; but in the End he will be justified of all, and in all he doth, that all Flesh may be silent before him.</P>
<P>And however my self, or any others my be left to themselves, to be tried in the Night, yea, should any utterly fall, or whatever may be acted by any Man or Woman, that is not justifiable in God's Sight, yet in vain dost thou, or you, gather up Sin, or watch for Iniquity, to cast upon the Light which condemns it in every enlighten'd Conscience, and there will clear himself to be no Author nor Actor therein; and I know by the Spirit of Jesus, which I have received, and which worketh in me, that this is not his Work, nor his Seed, nor in him that loves his Enemies, thou art not; but the old <HI>Accuser of the Brethren</HI> it is that worketh strongly in thee; and in the Light which thou reproachest, art thou seen to be <HI>the Man that makes Lies, and carries Tales to shed Blood, Ezek. xxii. 9, 12.</HI></P>

And he, with the Prodigal, humbled himself for his Transgression, and besought God with true Contrition of Soul, to pardon his Of∣fences thro' Jesus Christ. God, I firmly believe, forgave him, for he pardons the truly Penitent. His People receiv'd him with great Joy, for that he who had gone astray from God, was now return'd to the Father's House, and for that he who had separated himself from them thro' his Iniquity, was now thro' Repentance and forsaking of it, retur∣ned into the Unity of the Faith, and their Holy Fellowship in the Gospel of Christ.

Fox</HI>'s Hair, and at last said to the People, <HI>Ye wise Men of</HI> Bristol, <HI>I strange at you, that ye will stand here, and hear a Man speak, and affirm that which he cannot make good.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> ask'd the People, <Q>Whether they ever heard him speak before, or ever saw him before? And he bid them take Notice what Kind of Man this <HI>Gwin</HI> was, who so impudently said, that <HI>he spake and affirm'd that which he could not make good;</HI> and yet neither <HI>Gwin</HI> nor they ever heard him, or saw him before; and that therefore it was a lying, envious, and mali∣cious Spirit that spoke in him.</Q> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> charging <HI>Gwin</HI> to be si∣lent, began to preach, which lasted some Hours, without being disturbed. After this Meeting <HI>G. Fox</HI> departed from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and passing thro' <HI>Wiltshire, Marlborough,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Passes to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and on the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad speaks to the Protector in his Coach.</NOTE> and other Places, he return'd to <HI>London;</HI> and when he came near <HI>Hide-Park,</HI> he saw the Protector coming in his Coach; where∣upon he rode up to his Coach-side, and some of his Life-guard would have put him away; but the Protector forbad them. Then riding by his Coach-side, he spoke to him about the Sufferings of his Friends in the Nation, and shewed him how contrary this Persecution was to Christ and his Apostles, and to Christianity. And when they were come to the Gate of <HI>James</HI>'s-<HI>Park, G. Fox</HI> left <HI>Cromwel,</HI> who at parting desir'd him to come to his House. The next Day <HI>Mary Sanders,</HI> one of <HI>Crom∣wel</HI>'s Wife's Maids,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M. Sanders,</HI> one of <HI>Crom∣wel's</HI> Wife's Maids.</NOTE> came to <HI>G.

<PB N="159" REF="003104_0170_0FEFF48A8664FE50"/>
To which she replied, <HI>That was good News indeed.</HI> Not long after, <HI>G.

Fox</HI> bid the Protector <HI>lay down his Crown at the Feet of Jesus.</HI> And as he was stand∣ing by the Table, <HI>Cromwel</HI> came and sat upon the Table's Side by him, and said, <HI>He would be as high as</HI> G.

At length he returned to <HI>London</HI> again, this Year being now come to an End.</P>
<P>In the Parliament which <HI>Cromwel</HI> had call'd, a Law was made, where∣by <HI>Charles Stuart</HI>'s Title of King was rejected, and the Year 1657 be∣ing come, Subsidies were granted to <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and there was a Contri∣vance under Hand to make him King, of which, tho' he expressed his Dislike, yet he seemed not altogether averse to it; for speaking once with General <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Desborough,</HI> he began to droll with them about the Word <HI>Monarch,</HI> and said, <HI>It was but a Feather in a Man's Cap; and therefore he wondred that Men would not please the Children, and per∣mit them to enjoy their Rattle.</HI> But they not obscurely signify'd to him, that this Business did displease them; and told him, <Q>That those who put him upon it, were no Enemies to <HI>Charles Stuart;</HI> and that if he accepted of it, he would infallibly draw Ruin upon himself.</Q> Now, tho' he would not openly oppose them, yet he did not stick to tell them, <HI>They were a Couple of scrupulous Fellows,</HI> and so left them. It is re∣lated also, that Major General <HI>Lambert</HI> told <HI>Cromwel, That if he accepted the Crown, he could not assure the Army to him.</HI> The Design thus miscar∣rying, and <HI>Cromwel</HI> having now seen that the Matter would not go so cleverly, he refused the Title of <HI>King;</HI> and the Parliament confirming him in his Title of <HI>Protector,</HI> it was agreed, that the Parliament hence∣forth should consist of a Lower House, and <HI>another</HI> House, and that the Protector should name a Successor in the Government. Now he was solemnly vested in his Authority, a Throne for that Purpose being e∣rected in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> and he being clothed in a Purple-Robe lined with Ermins, and the Scepter and Sword being presented him, took the Oath to rule faithfully. <HI>Cromwel</HI> having called a new Parliament, it consisted of two Houses, <HI>viz.</HI> a House of Commons, and <HI>another</HI> House, as they called it. And many excluded Members having taken Place again in the House of Commons, it was believed that more than an Hundred of the Members were Enemies to <HI>Cromwel;</HI> and the Autho∣rity of the Upper House began to be called in Question by some, because it was fill'd up with many of his Creatures, some of them of low Rank. And this Matter was so carried on in the House of Commons, that <HI>Cromwel</HI> dissolved the Parliament, and he also made Major Gene∣ral <HI>Lambert</HI> surrender his Commission.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Burrough</HI> who often writ to <HI>Cromwel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Edward Bur∣rough</HI>'s Let∣ter to <HI>Crom∣wel.</HI></NOTE> having heard of the De∣sign of making him King, wrote a Letter to him, wherein I find that after having told the Protector, That he had many Warnings from the Lord, he thus speaks to him;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="160" REF="003104_0171_0FEFF4CE460AD060"/>
<P>I as one that hath obtain'd Mercy from the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1657</NOTE> and unto whom his Word is committed, being moved of him, do hereby in his Pre∣sence, yet once more warn thee, that thou fear before him, and dili∣gently hearken to him, and seek him with all thy Heart, that thou may'st know his Will and Counsel concerning thee, and may'st do it, and find Favour in his Sight, and live. Now is the Day that his Hand is stretched forth unto thee, to make thee a Blessing, or to leave thee a Curse for ever; and the Days of thy Visitation are near an End, when God will no more call unto thee, nor hear thee, when in the Day of thy Trouble thou call'st to him.— And if thou rejectest the Counsel of the Lord, and followest the Desires of thine own Heart, and the Wills of Men, and wilt not have the Light of the World, Christ Jesus, only to rule thee, and to teach thee, which condemns all Evil, then shall Evil surely fall upon thee, if thou lovest not the Light in thee, which condemns it; and the Judgments of God, nor the Day of his last Visitation with Vengeance thou may'st not escape. Therefore consider, and mark my Words, and let this Counsel be ac∣ceptable unto thee; let it move thee to Meekness, to Humbleness, and to fear before the Lord, assuredly knowing that it is he that changeth Times and Things, and that bringeth down, and setteth up whomsoever he will; and how that thou wast raised from a low Estate, and set over all thine Enemies.— And in that Day when thou wast raised up, when the Fear of the Lord was before thy Face, and thy Heart was towards him, and thou wast but little in thine own Eyes, then was it well with thee, and the Lord blessed thee.— And it was not once thought concerning thee, that the Hands of the Ungodly would have been strengthned against the Righteous under thee, or that such grievous and cruel Burdens and Oppressions would ever have been laid upon the Just, and acted against them in thy Name, and under thy Dominion, as unrighteously have come to pass in these three Years: And this thy suffering of such Things is thy Transgression, and thou hast not requited the Lord well for his Goodness unto thee, nor ful∣filled his Will in suffering that to be done under thee, and in thy Name, which the Lord raised thee against, and to break down, hadst thou been faithful to the End.</P>
<P>Again, consider, and let it move on thy Heart, not to exalt thy self, nor to be high-minded, but to fear continually, knowing that thou standest not by thy self, but by another, and that he is able to abase thee, and give thee into the Will of thy Enemies whensoever he will; and how the Lord hath preserved thee sometimes wonderfully, and doth unto this Day, from the murderous Plots, and crafty Policy of evil Men, who seek thy Evil, and would rejoice in thy Fall, and in the Desolation of thy Family and Countries: How have they, and do they lay Snares for thy Feet, that thou mayst be cut off from amongst Men, and die unhappily, and be accounted accursed? And yet to this Day he hath preserved thee, and been near to keep thee, tho' thou hast hardly known it; and the Lord's End is Love to thee in all these Things, and yet a little longer to try thee, that thou mayst give him the Glory.</P>
<P>O that thy Heart were opened to see his Hand, that thou mightest live unto him, and die in him in Peace. And beware lest Hardness of Heart possess thee, if thou slight his Love, and so be shut up in Darkness, and given to the Desires of thine Enemies, and lest to the Counsels of treacherous Men, who may seek to exalt thee by Flattery, that they may the better cast thee down, and destroy thee, and blot out thy Name in Reproach, and make thy Posterity a People miserable. But
<PB N="161" REF="003104_0172_0FEFF48CF0A5F2F0"/>
now, O consider, and let it enter thy Heart, for thou hast not an∣swered the Lord, but been wanting to him for all this, and hast chosen thy own Way and Glory, rather than his, and not fulfilled his Counsel in raising thee; for the Bonds of Cruelty are not loosed by thee, and the Oppressed are not altogether set free; neither is Op∣pression taken off from the Back of the Poor, nor the Laws regulated, nor the Liberty of pure Consciences altogether allowed: But these Dominions are filled with cruel Oppressions, and the Poor groan every where under the heavy Hand of Injustice; the Needy are trodden down under Foot, and the Oppressed cry for Deliverance, and are ready to faint for true Justice and Judgment. The Proud exalt them∣selves against the Poor, and the High-minded and rebellious contemn the Meek of the Earth: The Horn of the Ungodly is exalted above the Lord's Heritage, and they that are departed from Iniquity are be∣come a Prey to Oppressors; and the cruel-hearted deal cruelly with the Innocent in these Nations.— Many are unjustly and wofully Suf∣ferers, because they cannot swear on this or that Occasion, tho' in all Cases they speak the Truth, and do obey Christ's Commands; even such are trodden upon, by unjust Fines charged upon them; and this is by the Corruptness of some that bear Rule under thee; who rule not for God as they ought, but turn the Sword of Justice.— Some suffer long and tedious Imprisonments, and others cruel Stripes and Abuses, and Danger of Life many Times, from wicked Men, for reproving Sin, and crying against the Abominations of the Times, (which the Scriptures also testify against) in Streets or other Places; some having been sent to Prison, taken on the Highway, and no Evil charged against them; and others committed, being taken out of peaceable Meetings, and whipp'd, and sent to Prison, without Trans∣gression of any Law, just or unjust, wholly thro' the Rage and Envy of the Devil, and such who have perverted Judgment and Justice; and some in Prisons have suffered superabundantly from the Hands of the cruel Jailors, and their Servants, by Beatings and Threatnings, and putting Irons on them, and not suffering any of their Friends to visit them with Necessaries! and some have died in the Prisons, whose Lives were not dear to them, whose Blood will be reckoned on Account against thee one Day.— Some have suffered hard Cru∣elties, because they could not respect Persons, and bow with Hat or Knee; and from these Cruelties canst thou not altogether be excused in the Sight of God, being brought forth in thy Name, and under thy Power. Consider, Friend, and be awakened to true Judgment, let the Lord search thy Heart, and lay these Things to Mind, that thou may'st be an Instrument to remove every Burthen, and may'st at last fulfil the Will of God.— O be awakened, be awakened, and seek the Lord's Glory, and not thine own, lest thou perish before the Lord and Men: Nay, if Men would give thee Honour, and high Titles, and Princely Thrones, take it not; for that which would exalt and honour thee in the World, would betray thee to the World, and cast thee down in the Sight of the World: And this is God's Word to thee! What! shall the whole Nation be perjured Men, and thou the Cause of it? and wilt thou transgress by Build∣ing again that which thou hast destroyed? Give Heed unto my Words, and understand my Speech; Be not exalted by Man, left Man betray thee.— Deal favourably and relieve the Oppressed; boast not thy self, tho' the Lord hath used thee in his Hand: But know, that when he will, he can cast thee, as a Rod, out of his Hand into the Fire; for in his Hand thou art; if thou wilt honour him, he will honour thee; otherwise he can, yea, and will confound thee
<PB N="162" REF="003104_0173_0FEFF4D0A4A21CE0"/>
and break thee, and make thee weak as Water before him. His Love thro' my Heart breathes unto thee; he would thy Happiness, if thou wilfully contemn it not by exalting thy self, and seeking thy own Glory, and hardning thy Heart against the Cry of the Poor. This I was moved in Bowels of Pity to lay before thee, who am thy Friend, not in Flattery, but in an upright Heart, who wishes well unto thee in the Lord.</P>

<P><HI>That which</HI> E. Burrough <HI>mentions in the Fore-Part of this Letter of the</HI> grievous Burdens and Oppressions laid upon the Just, <HI>seems chiefly to re∣gard the Tythes which the Priests extorted from the</HI> Quakers, <HI>so that many thereby were reduced to Poverty: And the Hainousness of this was was not unknown to</HI> Cromwel; <HI>for when he was about to give Bat∣tle to his Enemies near</HI> Dunbar <HI>in</HI> Scotland, <HI>he said in his Prayer to God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwel</HI> breaks his Promise made in Di∣stress at <HI>Dunbar</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> That if the Lord would be pleased to deliver him at that Time, he would take off that great Oppression of Tythes. <HI>But this Promise he never perform∣ed, but suffered himself to be swayed by the Flatteries of his Teach∣ers: And therefore it was not without great Cause that</HI> E. Burrough <HI>laid this grievous Oppression before him. A Copy of the said Letter, of which but a Part is inserted here to shun Prolixity, was given into the Hands of</HI> Oliver Cromwel, <HI>then Protector, in the third Month of this Year. In the next Month</HI> E. Burrough <HI>spoke with him about it and</HI> Cromwel <HI>told him in Effect,</HI> That all Persecution and Cruelty was against his Mind; <HI>and said,</HI> That he was not guilty of those Persecutions acted unjustly upon <HI>Burrough's</HI> Friends. <HI>This made</HI> E.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>consider what the Cause is, that what thou desirest not to be done is yet done: Is it not that thou mayest please Men? Making it appear thou art more willing to do the false Teachers of this Nation, and wicked Men, a Pleasure, than to own the People of God in relieving them, and easing them of their cru∣el Burthens and Oppressions laid upon them by unjust Men. For a Word of thy Mouth, or a Shew of thy Countenance in Dislike of these cruel and unjust Perse∣cutions, would bind the Hands of many blood-thirsty Men. Therefore consider: Thou canst not be cleared in the Sight of the Lord God from them, being acted under thee, and in thy Name: For there seems rather to be a Favouring of them in thee, by Forbearance of the Actors of Cruelty, by which their Hands are strength∣ened, than any Dislike shewed by thee, in bearing thy Witness, as thou oughtest to do, against them. For thou knowest of some in this City and else-where, whom we know to be just Men, who suffer Imprisonment and the Loss of their Liber∣ties, because for Conscience Sake they cannot swear; and many others in thi Na∣tion, suffering cruel Things upon the like or same Ground, even for well-doing, and not for Evil; which Oppression might be removed, and their unjust Suffe∣rings taken off by thee, by a Word from thy Mouth or Pen; and this makes that thou canst not be clear in the Sight of God in these Things; because not help∣ed by thee, who hast the Power to help it.</P>
<P>And as concerning the Light of Christ, at which thou stumblest, by which eve∣ry Man that cometh into the World is enlightened, in short, this I say, This Light to thee is given of God, and thou must own it to be thy only Teacher to receive by it from the Father, and to be guided by it in all Things, if ever thou inheritest God's Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of Christ is setting up by his own Power, and all must bow and become subject thereunto; he needeth none of thy Policy, nor the Strength of thy Arm to advance it: yet would he have thee not to prove thy self an open Enemy thereof, by doing or suffering to be done, Cruelty and Injustice against them whom the Lord is redeeming out of this World, into Subjection unto that Kingdom; lest thou be such a one, as will not enter thy self, nor suffer others to enter, and so Destruction come upon thee. Wherefore arise as out of Sleep, and
<PB N="163" REF="003104_0174_0FEFF490B4ABFE58"/>
slumber not in this World's Glory and Honour; be not overcome by the Plea∣sures of this World, nor the flattering Titles of Men: Wink not at the Cruelty and Oppression acted by some, who shelter under thee, and make thy Name a Cloak for Mischief against the Ʋpright.</P>
<P>Consider, I say, consider, and be thou changed in thy Mind and Heart; lest thou having forgotten God, and his many Deliverances, be shut up, and num∣bred for Destruction. I desire, the Lord may give thee a more perfect Ʋnder∣standing of his Ways and Judgments, and that the Crown immortal thou may'st strive for by Meekness and Righteousness, thro' relieving the Oppressed, and shewing Mercy to the Poor, and removing every Burden which lies upon the In∣nocent; and this is the Desire of him who is thy Friend, and would not have thee crown'd with Dishonour, thro' suffering the People of God to be oppressed in thy Name, which will be thy Overthrow absolutely, if thou removest it not by turning and easing the Oppressed.</P>

<P>This Letter was delivered to <HI>O. Cromwel</HI> in the Fourth Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writes again.</NOTE> and in the Month following <HI>E. Burrough</HI> wrote again to him: <Q>That the good Name PROTECTOR, by the great Oppression acted in his Name, was abused, and subverted; and that instead of Pro∣tection by it, great Injustice was acted under it, and covered with it. Besides, that several Justices of Peace, and other Officers in Trust under him, when they had owned the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> had been cast out of their Places, tho' they had not denied to serve him and the Common-wealth, neither had Unfaithfulness to their Trust been proved against them.</Q></P>
<P>In <HI>September, E.

And that he going on in oppressing thro' Tyranny, or suffering it, perhaps the Lord might raise up the wicked to be a Plague to Wickedness, and suffer the Oppressors to overthrow Oppressions. That there were others, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fifth Monarchy Men, who, tho' not so bad as the former, yet secretly murmured against him, and envyed him, not being Friends to his Government, some of them being cast out and rejected, with∣out just Cause, as they supposed.</Q> And as to us, <HI>how can we,</HI> said he <HI>mention thee in our Prayers to God, except it be to be delivered from thee, who are daily unjustly Sufferers by thee, or because of thee? Or how can we be Friends to that Government, under which we daily suffer such hard and cruel Things, as the Loss of our Liberty and Estates, and are in Danger of Life also?</HI></P>
<P>It was about the Beginning of this Year that <HI>Christopher Birkhead</HI> came to <HI>Zealand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C.

When he was asked, <HI>What his Name was?</HI> he answered, <HI>that his Name according to the Flesh was</HI> Christopher Birk∣head
<PB N="164" REF="003104_0175_0FEFF4D2DB87CA60"/>
Then it was ask'd him, <HI>whether he had yet another Name?</HI> And his Answer was, <HI>Yes, written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</HI> Being enquired, <HI>what that Name was?</HI> he made Answer, <HI>None knows it but him that hath it.</HI> To which was said, <HI>Why, if you have it, tell it us. No,</HI> replied he, <HI>read it, if ye have seen the Book of the Lamb opened: It is forbidden me to tell it.</HI> Then the <HI>English</HI> Teacher <HI>Spanke</HI> ask'd, <HI>Whether he had seen the Book of the Lamb opened?</HI> And he answered, <HI>yea.</HI> The next Question was, <HI>Whe∣ther he had opened it? No,</HI> said <HI>Birkhead, it was the Lamb that did it.</HI> Then <HI>Spanke</HI> asked, <HI>Whether his Name in the Book of the Lamb, was not Jesus? No,</HI> quoth <HI>Birkhead, that is the Name of the Lamb.</HI> More other Questions to ensnare him, <HI>Spanke</HI> put to him. And being examined by the Magistrates concerning the Place of his Abode, his Calling, or Trade, <HI>&amp;c. Spanke</HI> was asked what he had to say against him: Who then related what had happened in the Congregation. Concerning this, se∣veral Questions were asked of <HI>Birkhead;</HI> but since he understood not <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Tongue but imperfectly, he complain'd that he could not fully answer for himself so as he wished. He was asked also, <HI>Whether any Body else came along with him,</HI> and he was charged <HI>to speak the Truth.</HI> To which he said, <HI>that God did not permit him to lye.</HI> One of the Preachers then said, <HI>That all Men were Liars.</HI> To this, <HI>Birk∣head</HI> replied, <HI>that tho' all Man were Liars, yet he knew a Deliverance from Lying.</HI> Then <HI>Spanke</HI> bid him, <HI>not to add to the Scriptures.</HI> For <HI>Birkhead</HI> had accused him a little before, <HI>that he had added his Meaning to the Scriptures.</HI> And it being strongly asserted that all Men were Liars, <HI>Birkhead</HI> took Occasion from thence, to ask <HI>Spanke, Whether he was a Liar?</HI> who without any Hesitation answering, <HI>Yes, Birkhead</HI> bluntly told him, <HI>Then thou art of thy Father the Devil.</HI> Now the Matter of <HI>J. Naylor</HI> having caused strange Reports of the <HI>Quakers</HI> every where, and <HI>Birk∣head,</HI> for Want of the Language not being able to answer so plainly every Objection, his Offence without Question was aggravated the more; and the Conclusion was, that he was sentenced to be confined in the House of Correction. But after some Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sent to the House of Cor∣rection, but after releas'd. <HI>G.

Thatcher <HI>at</HI> Amster∣dam.</NOTE> and one <HI>Humble Thatcher</HI> coming with him (whom I could never learn to have been tru∣ly in Communion with the <HI>Quakers</HI>) it caused some Jealousie; for <HI>Ames,</HI> who formerly had been in Military Employment, was an extraor∣dinary bold Man; and about this Time it seems, a Paper was put on the Door of the <HI>English</HI> Meeting-house, tho' <HI>Ames</HI> declared he knew Nothing of it, or who was the Author. And about this Time also the strange Business of <HI>J. Naylor</HI> being noised abroad by a Book that was given out in Print at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and some other Pamphlets stuft with several Untruths, and abominable Lies, it was not to be wondred at, that the Magistrates fearing some Mischief, sent for <HI>Ames</HI> and <HI>Thatcher</HI> to appear before them, and commanded them to depart the Town within twenty four Hours. But they being perswaded of their own Innocency, did not obey this Command. The next Day appearing before the Magistrates, and not putting off their Hats, it seems they were look'd upon as such as did not own Magistrates; (for this the <HI>Quakers</HI> stood charged with in publick Print, and were compared to the tumultuous Crew of <HI>Anabaptists</HI> or Fifth Monarchy

From thence he travelled into <HI>Kent, Sussex,</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> and coming to <HI>Basingstoke,</HI> tho' the People were rude there, yet he had a quiet Meeting in the Place.

Fox</HI> asserted the contrary, and said that he had spoken of no other Light than <HI>John</HI> bore Witness unto, viz. <HI>The Word which was in the Beginning with God, and which Word was God; and that was the true Light, which en∣lighteneth every Man that cometh into the World. G.

Why,</HI> resumed <HI>G. Fox, Had not the Priest two Caps on his Head, a black one, and a white one? And if the Brim of the Hat, which was but to defend from the Weather, had been cut off, then my Friend would have had but one Cap. These are frivolous Things,</HI> said the Governor. <HI>Why then,</HI> said <HI>G. Fox, dost thou cast my Friend into Prison for such frivolous Things?</HI> Then the Governor asked him, <HI>Whether he owned Election and Reprobation. Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>And thou art in the Reprobation.</HI> This so incens'd the Gover∣nor, that he told <HI>G. Fox, He would send him to Prison, till he proved it. G. Fox,</HI> not at all at a Loss, said, <HI>I'll prove that quickly, if thou wilt but confess Truth:</HI> And then he asked him, <HI>Whether Wrath, Fury, and Rage, and Persecution were not Marks of Reprobation? For he that was born of the Flesh persecuted him that was born of the Spirit; and Christ and his Apostles never persecuted nor imprisoned any.</HI> This Speech of his so struck the Governor that he fairly confess'd <HI>That he had too much Wrath, Haste, and Passion in him.</HI> Which made <HI>G. Fox</HI> say, <HI>that</HI> Esau <HI>the first Birth was up in him, not</HI> Jacob <HI>the second Birth.</HI> By this the Man was so reach'd, that he confess'd to Truth, and inviting <HI>G.

After having staid there some Days, he went to some other Places in the North, and to <HI>Scotland;</HI> here travelling from Town to Town, he met with great Opposition from some Priests:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes into <HI>Scotland,</HI> has much Opposi∣tion.</NOTE> For in an Assembly they had drawn up several Articles or Curses, to be read in their Steeple-Houses, the first of which was, <HI>Cursed is he that saith, eve∣ry Man hath a Light within him sufficient to lead him to Salvation: And let all the People say Amen.</HI> An <HI>Independent</HI> Pastor preaching one Day against the <HI>Quakers</HI> and the Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Remark∣able Occur∣rence.</NOTE> and calling the Light natural, cursed it, and so fell down as dead in his Pulpit: The People carrying him out, and pouring Strong-Waters into him, it brought him to Life again; but he was mopish, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one of his Hearers said, he never recovered his Senses.

But Colonel <HI>Ashton,</HI> a Justice of Peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Col.

<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> now travelled almost over all <HI>Scotland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

He went also among the Highlanders, who were a mischievous People. Returning at length to <HI>Leith,</HI> the Inn-keeper told him that the Council had granted forth Warrants to apprehend him, because he was not gone out of the Nation after the seven Days were expired, that they had ordered him to depart in. Some others told him the same, to whom he said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Makes slight of Warrants to take him up.</NOTE> <HI>What do you tell me of their Warrants against me? If there were a Cart-load of them, I do not heed them; for the Lord's Power is over them all.</HI> From <HI>Leith,</HI> he went to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> again, and went to the Inn where he had lodged before, and no Man offered to meddle with him. <HI>Alexander Parker</HI> and <HI>Robert Widders</HI> being also there, he re∣solved to go with <HI>Parker</HI> to <HI>Johnston,</HI> out of which Town some Time before he had been led by Soldiers: And he came into <HI>Johnston</HI> just as they were drawing up the Bridges, the Officers and Soldiers never questioning him. And coming to Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI>'s House, from which he had been haled before, he found there many Officers, who lifting up their Hands, wondered that he came again: But he told them, <HI>The Lord God had sent him amongst them again.</HI> Then the <HI>Baptists</HI> sent him a Letter, by Way of Challenge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is challenged by the <HI>Bap∣tists</HI> at <HI>John∣ston.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That they would discourse with him the next Day.</HI> And he sent them Word, that he would meet them at a certain House, about half a Mile out of the Town, at such an Hour.

Day he went to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> where walking with a Friend or two of his, in the Steeple-house-yard, he met with one of the chief Men of the Town there, and spoke to one of his Friends, to tell him, <Q>That about the Ninth-Hour next Morning, there was to be a Meeting there, of the People of God called <HI>Quakers,</HI> of which they desired him to give Notice to the People of the Town.

Accordingly in the Morning many came, both Poor and Rich; and a Captain of Horse being quartered in the Town, came there with his Troopers also.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Has a Meet∣ing at <HI>Dun∣bar.</HI></NOTE> To this Company <HI>G.

<P>We have seen before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Severities a∣gainst the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>New-Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> that a Law was made there, to prevent the <HI>Quakers</HI> coming into that Country. The first I find that came after that, were <HI>Anne Burden,</HI> a Widow, whose Business was to gather up some Debts in the Country, that were due to her, and <HI>Mary Dyer</HI> from <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> who before her coming, knew nothing of what had been done there concerning the <HI>Quakers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

As for <HI>Anne Burden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their farther Cruelties to <HI>Ann Burden.</HI></NOTE> she was kept in Prison, tho' sick, about a Quarter of a Year. Whilst she was in this Restraint, some tender Hearted People had procured of her Debts to the Value of about thirty Pounds in Goods: And when she at length was to be sent away, she desired that she might have Liberty to pass to <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> because her Goods were not fit for <HI>England.</HI> Now how reasonable soever this Request was, yet a Master of a Ship was compelled to carry her to <HI>England,</HI> without her Goods, for which she came there, except to the Value of about six Shillings, which an honest Man sent her upon an old Account. And when the Master of the Ship asked what should pay for her Passage, the Rulers bid him take so much of her Goods as would answer it. But he was too honest to do so, being perswaded that she would not let him be a Loser, tho' he could not compel her to pay, since she went not of her own Will: Yet for all that, she paid him at <HI>London.</HI> After she was gone, when he that had the first Trust from her Husband, was to convey her Goods to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> these rapacious People stopp'd to the Value of six Pounds ten Shillings, for her Passage, for which they paid nothing, and seven Shillings for Boat-Hire to carry her on Ship-board, tho' the Master profered the Governor to carry her in his own Boat; but that was not allowed; she being sent with the Hang-man in a Boat that was press'd: Besides, they took to the Value of Fourteen Shillings for the Jailor, to whom she

<P>The next of the <HI>Quakers</HI> that came to <HI>Boston</HI> was <HI>Mary Clark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.

The Cords of these Whips were commonly as thick as a Man's little Finger, having each some Knots at the End; and the Stick was sometimes so long, that the Hangman made use of both his Hands, to strike the harder. The next that came were <HI>Christopher Holder</HI> and <HI>John Copeland,</HI> who had been banished before,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C. Holder</HI> and <HI>J.

Then they were lockt up in Pri∣son, and the Jailor kept them three Days without any Food, not gi∣ving them so much as a Draught of Water; and so close, that none might come to speak with them; lying on the Boards, without Bed or Straw.

unto them for all the World.</HI> But they continu'd to strive much with him, and would have him hold up one of his Fingers, as a Sign of owning them; and one bid him say, <HI>Christ is bad.</HI> But he answer∣ed, <HI>He knew him to be good, and he was his Servant.</HI> Then some grow∣ing angry, said, <HI>If he would not turn to their Religion, he should die.</HI> To which he replying, <HI>That he would rather die than turn unto them;</HI> it was answered, <HI>He should then die.</HI> And so by their Order, the Executioner haled him away to the Place where it was expected that he should have been burnt to Death with Camel's Dung. Here he was made to sit down upon the Ground, and was as a Sheep among the Wolves. Whilst he was thus sitting with a retired Mind, the <HI>Turks</HI> began to fall out among themselves, and whilst they were at odds, a grave ancient <HI>Turk,</HI> a Man of Note, came to him, and said, <HI>whether he would turn from his Religion, or not, he should not die.</HI> Then he was brought before the Priests again, who asked him, <HI>will you turn?</HI> And he answering, <HI>No,</HI> they recorded in a Book, <HI>That he was no</HI> Roman Catholick, <HI>but of ano∣ther Religion;</HI> for having denied to be such a <HI>Catholick,</HI> yet he had own∣ed that he was a Christian.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> being come now to be more sedate, the aforesaid ancient Man ordered his Servants to conduct <HI>Robinson</HI> to his House, where he was friendly entertained, and soon perceived that the Friars had thus plotted against him; for he went not into the Mosque of his own Accord, being led into it; but Heaven preserved him. After having been four or five Days in the House of the ancient <HI>Turk,</HI> there came a Guard of Horse∣men, hired by the Friars, to carry him to <HI>Gaza;</HI> for they had pre-in∣form'd the Basha of that Place against him: But <HI>Robinson</HI> being come thither, Things took another Turn than they expected; for the Basha being by some <HI>Turks</HI> made acquainted with the mischievous Design of the Friars, made them not only pay a considerable Fine, but command∣ed them also to convey <HI>Robinson</HI> safely to <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Now whilst he was at <HI>Gaza,</HI> he was visited by many <HI>Turks, Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Armenians;</HI> the lat∣ter of which having heard he was a Christian, and that he chose rather to die than to turn from his Religion, became very loving to him, as were the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> also shewed themselves moderate towards him. Then according to the fore-mentioned Order of the Basha, he was carried to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and there, by the Appointment of the Fri∣ars, brought into their Convent, where at first they seemingly shewed Love unto him, and one confessed▪ <HI>There was now an evident Sign, that he was a good Christian, for he was come thro' Persecution and Sufferings; and those Things which had been spoken in his Prejudice, were manifest to be untrue. Robinson</HI> told the Friar, <HI>It was he and his Brethren that had been the Cause of his Sufferings, and withstood his coming to</HI> Jerusalem. To which the other returned, <HI>That the</HI> English <HI>Friar had misinformed them by his Writing, which had caused them to do what they had done; and that therefore they desired he would now pass by those Things, seeing he was come thro' in such a miraculous Manner; for</HI> (continu'd the Friar) <HI>it was the Lord's Work, thus to carry him thro', and he might praise God he was preserved.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning there came a Friar to him, and asked, <HI>If he would become an obedient Child, and go to visit the holy Places, according to their Custom?</HI> He answered, <HI>No.</HI> Then the Friar said, <HI>Whereas others give great Sums of Money to see them, you shall see them for Nothing.</HI> But <HI>Ro∣binson</HI> replyed, <HI>I shall not visit them in your Manner, for in so Doing I should sin against God.</HI> This did not please the Friar, yet he said, <HI>They would honour him as much as ever they did any</HI> English-Man <HI>that came thither, if he would conform unto them.</HI> But <HI>Robinson</HI> continued immoveable, and said, <HI>He should not conform; and as to their Honour, he did not matter it.</HI> Then the Friar became angry, and said, <HI>They would make him an Exam∣ple
<PB N="172" REF="003104_0183_0FEFF4DD98DB0980"/>
to all</HI> Englishmen <HI>that came thither.</HI> To which <HI>Robinson,</HI> returned, <HI>I chuse rather your Dishonour than your Honour.</HI> The Friar seeing he could not prevail, went away in Anger, and within a short Time came a∣gain, and other Friars being present, one asked him, <HI>If he would visit their Church, and the holy Sepulchre, and</HI> Bethlehem, <HI>with the rest of the ho∣ly Places, as other Pilgrims did?</HI> But he told them, <HI>At present he had no Business to visit them; and in their Manner he should not visit them at all,</HI> viz. <HI>to worship them.</HI> Then one said to him, <HI>How can you be a Servant of God, and will not go to visit the Places where the holy Men of God dwelt?</HI> To which he returned, <HI>That they, under Pretence of doing Service to God, in visiting the Places where the holy Men dwelt, did oppose that Way, and re∣sist that Life, which the holy Men of God lived and walked in.</HI> Then one of the Friars said, <HI>What do you preach unto us for?</HI> To which he repli∣ed, <HI>That he would have them turn from those evil Practices they lived in, else the Wrath of the Almighty would be kindled against them.</HI> But they did not at all like such Discourse, and therefore said, <HI>If he would not go and visit the aforesaid Places, yet he must give twenty five Dollars, as was the Manner of those that visited them; for,</HI> said they, <HI>the</HI> Turks <HI>must be paid, whether he would visit them, or not; but if he would visit them, then they would pay it for him.</HI> To this he signified, that he could not submit to such unreasonable Terms. Then they brought him before a <HI>Turk</HI> in Authority in that Place, who asked him divers Questions, to which he soberly gave Answers; and they discoursing about the Worship of the <HI>Christians,</HI> the <HI>Turk</HI> asked also, <HI>What was the Ground of his coming to</HI> Jerusalem? To which he answered, <HI>That it was by the Command of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth he came thither; and that the great and tender Love of God was made manifest in visiting them; his compassionate Mercies being such, that he would gather them in this the Day of his gathering.</HI> This was the Message which <HI>Robinson</HI> believed he had from the Lord to declare unto them, whether they would hear, or forbear. And afterwards he wrote, that having thus cleared his Con∣science, he found great Peace with the Lord, and therefore he mag∣nified his glorious Name, who had gone along with him, and preser∣ved him in many Trials. For the Friars, who intended him Mis∣chief, were commanded by the <HI>Turks</HI> to carry him again safe and free of Charges, to <HI>Ramla.</HI> Here I leave him, because I don't find how he came home; but that he returned thither in Safety, appears to me from the Relation he afterwards published of his Travels.</P>
<P>The Year being come to an End,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox,</HI> with <HI>A. Pearson,</HI> visit some of the Alder∣men of <HI>New∣castle.</HI></NOTE> I return again to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> whom we left at Newcastle. Whilst he was there, he, with <HI>Anthony Pearson,</HI> visited some of the Aldermen; and among these one <HI>Ledger,</HI> who, as well as the Priests, had said, <HI>The Quakers would not come into any great Towns, but lived in the Fields like Butterflies. G. Fox</HI> desired to have a Meeting amongst them; but they would not yield to it.

But,</HI> said he, <HI>now we are come into your Town, you will not come to us? Who are the Butterflies now?</HI> Then <HI>Ledger</HI> began to plead for the Sabbath-Day; which made <HI>G.

<P>Travelling from thence, and passing thro' <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Bi∣shoprick,</HI> he came to <HI>Durham,</HI> where was a Man come down from <HI>London</HI> to set up a Colledge there, to make Ministers of Christ, as they said. <HI>G.

<HI>Hebrew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1658</NOTE> <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and the Seven Arts, was not the Way to make them Ministers of Christ; for the Languages began at <HI>Babel;</HI> and to the <HI>Greeks</HI> that spake <HI>Greek</HI> as their Mother-Tongue, the Preach∣ing of the Cross of Christ was Foolishness; and to the <HI>Jews</HI> that spake <HI>Hebrew</HI> as their Mother-Tongue, Christ was a Stumbling-Block. And as for the <HI>Romans</HI> who spake <HI>Latin,</HI> they persecuted the Christians; and <HI>Pilate,</HI> one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Governors, set <HI>Hebrew, Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> a-top of Christ when he crucified him. Thus the Languages, which began at <HI>Babel,</HI> had been set above Christ, the Word: And <HI>John</HI> the Divine, who preached the Word, that was in the Beginning, said, that the Beast and the Whore had Power over Tongues and Languages, and they were as Waters, and in the Mystery <HI>Babylon,</HI> for they began at <HI>Babel;</HI> and the Persecutors of Christ set them over him, when he was crucified by them.</Q> <HI>Dost thou think,</HI> said <HI>G. Fox,</HI> to the Man, <HI>to make Ministers of Christ by these natural confused Languages, which sprang from</HI> Babel, <HI>are admired in</HI> Babylon, <HI>and set a-top of Christ, the Life, by a Perse∣cutor?</HI> The Man puzzled a little by this, confess'd to many Things spoken by <HI>G. Fox.</HI> Then it was shewed him farther, <Q>That Christ made his Ministers himself, and gave Gifts unto them, and bid them pray to the Lord of the Harvest, to send forth Labourers: That <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> tho' unlearned and ignorant as to School-Learning, preached Christ the Word, which was in the Beginning before <HI>Babel</HI> was: And that <HI>Paul</HI> also was made an Apostle, not of Man, nor by Man, but by Jesus Christ, who is the same now, and so is his Gospel, as it was at that Day.</Q> This Discourse had such Effect upon the Man, that he became very loving; and having considered the Matter farther, he never set up his intended College.</P>
<P>From <HI>Durham G. Fox</HI> passed to <HI>Nottingham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to <HI>Not∣tingham.</HI></NOTE> where he gathered again a scattered People, that having about eight Years before been convinc'd of the Truth, had been led aside by one <HI>Rice Jones.</HI></P>
<P>From hence he went into <HI>Warwickshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to <HI>J.

He had advised them to state this
<PB N="174" REF="003104_0185_0FEFF4E0DC1E3E00"/>
Question, <HI>Whether the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>as it now stood, was not degenerated from the true Church which was in the primitive Times, from the Life and Do∣ctrine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> with two others meet him there.</NOTE> <HI>and from the Power and Spirit that those Believers were in?</HI> They ha∣ving stated the Question accordingly, the Jesuit affirmed, <HI>That the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>now was in the Virginity and Purity of the Primitive Church.</HI> By this Time, <HI>G. Fox</HI> being come in, the Jesuit was asked, <HI>Whether they had the Holy Ghost poured out upon them, as the Apostles had?</HI> And he said, <HI>No.</HI> Then said <HI>G. Fox, If ye have not the same Holy Ghost poured forth upon you, and the same Power and Spirit, that the Apostles had, then ye are degene∣rated from the Power and Spirit, which the Primitive Church was in.</HI> And he asked the Jesuit, <HI>What Scripture they had for setting up Cloisters for Nuns, Abbies and Monasteries for Men, and for their praying by Beads, and to Ima∣ges, and for making Crosses, for forbidding of Meats and Marriages, and for putting People to Death for Religion?</HI> If, said he, <HI>ye are in the Practice of the Primitive Church, in its Purity and Virginity, then let us see by Scripture where-ever they practised such Things?</HI> For it was agreed mutually, that both the <HI>Jesuit</HI> and the <HI>Quakers</HI> should make good by Scripture what they said. Then the <HI>Jesuit</HI> said, there was a <HI>written,</HI> and an <HI>unwritten Word.</HI> Which made <HI>G. Fox</HI> ask, <HI>What he called his unwritten Word?</HI> And he answer'd, <HI>The written Word is the Scriptures, and the unwritten Word is that which the Apostles spake by Word of Mouth, which are all those Traditions that we practise.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> bid him <HI>prove that by Scripture;</HI> and the Jesuit alledged the Words of the Apostle, 2 <HI>Thess. ii.</HI> 5. <HI>When I was with you, I told you these Things: That is,</HI> said he, <HI>I told you of Nunneries and Monasteries, of putting to Death for Religion, and of Praying by Beads and to Images,</HI> &amp;c. This he affirmed to be the <HI>unwritten Word</HI> of the Apostles, <HI>which they told then, and had since been continued by Tradition unto these Times.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> desired him <HI>to read that Scripture again, that he might see how he had perverted the Apostle's Words, since that which the Apostle said there he had told them before, was not an unwritten Word, but was written down there;</HI> namely, <HI>that the Man of Sin, the Son of Perdition, should be re∣vealed before that great and terrible Day of Christ, which he was writing of, should come. And therefore this was not telling them any of those things the</HI> Church of Rome <HI>practised. Besides, the Apostle, in the third Chapter of the said</HI> Epistle, <HI>told the Church of some disorderly Persons he heard were amongst them, Busy-bodies, who did not work at all; concerning whom he had command∣ded them</HI> by his unwritten Word, <HI>when he was among them, that if any would not work, neither should be eat; which now he commanded them again in his</HI> written Words in this Epistle, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> iii.</P>
<P>The Jesuit now finding no other Scriptural Proof for the Tradition of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> let that Point fall, and came to the Sacrament of the Altar; to prove the Reality of which, he began with the <HI>Pas∣chal Lamb,</HI> and the <HI>Shew Bread,</HI> and so came to the Words of Christ, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> and to what the Apostle writ to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> conclu∣ding from thence, <HI>that after the Priest had consecrated the Bread and Wine, it was immortal and divine, and that he who received it, received the whole Christ.</HI> To this <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>that the same Apostle told the</HI> Corinthians, <HI>after they had taken Bread and Wine in Remembrance of Christ's Death,</HI> that they were Reprobates if Christ was not in them. <HI>But that if the Bread they eat was Christ, he must of Necessity have been in them, after they had eaten it. Besides, if the Bread and Wine which the</HI> Corinthians <HI>ate and drunk, was Christ's Body, how then</HI> (continued he) <HI>hath Christ a Body in Heaven?</HI> And he also signified to him, <HI>that both the Disciples at the Supper, and the</HI> Corinthians <HI>afterwards, were to eat the Bread and drink the Wine</HI> in Remembrance of Christ, <HI>and</HI> to shew forth his Death till he came; <HI>which plainly prov'd, that the Bread and Wine which they took, was not his Body. For if it had been his real Body that they ate,</HI> then he had been
<PB N="175" REF="003104_0186_0FEFF49E7A480B40"/>
come, and was then <HI>there present; and it would have been improper to have done such a thing in Remembrance of him, if he had been then present with them; as he must have been, if that Bread and Wine, which they eat and drank, had been his real Body.</HI> And as to the Words of Christ; <HI>This is my Body,</HI> G. Fox told him, <HI>Christ calls himself a</HI> Vine, <HI>and a</HI> Door, <HI>and is called in Scripture, a</HI> Rock: <HI>Is Christ therefore an outward Rock, Door, or Vine? O,</HI> said the Jesuit, <HI>These Words are to be interpreted. So,</HI> said G. Fox, <HI>are those Words of Christ, This is my Body.</HI> And having thus stopt the Jesuit's Mouth, he made this Proposal; <HI>That seeing he said the Bread and Wine was immortal and divine, and the very Christ, and that whosoever received it, received the whole Christ; a Meeting might be appointed between some such</HI> Pa∣pists <HI>as the</HI> Pope <HI>and his</HI> Cardinals <HI>should appoint, and some of those called</HI> Quakers: <HI>And then,</HI> said he, <HI>let a Bottle of Wine, and a Loaf of Bread he brought, and divided each into two Parts, and let them consecrate which of those Parts they will; and then let the consecrated and unconsecrated Bread and Wine be set in a safe Place, with a sure Watch upon it; and let Trial then be made, whether the consecrated Bread and Wine will not lose its Goodness,</HI> viz. <HI>the Bread grow dry and mouldy, and the Wine turn dead and soure, as well and as soon as that which was unconsecrated; for by this Means the Truth of this Matter may be made manifest. And if the consecrated Bread and Wine change not, but retain their Savour and Goodness, this may be a Means to draw many to your Church. But if they change, decay, and lose their Goodness, then ought you to confess and forsake your Error, and shed no more Blood about it, as hath been done, especially in Queen</HI> Mary's <HI>Days.</HI> To this, the Jesuit made this Reply; <HI>Take a Piece of new Cloth, and cut it into two Pieces, and make two Garments of it, and put one of them upon King</HI> David's <HI>Back, and the other upon a Beggar's, and the one Garment shall wear away as well as the other. Is this,</HI> said G. Fox, <HI>thy Answer? Yes,</HI> said the Jesuit. <HI>Then,</HI> said G. Fox, <HI>By this the Company may all be satisfied, that your consecrated Bread and Wine is not Christ. Dost thou now say that the consecrated Bread and Wine, which you have told People was immortal and divine, and the real Body and Blood of Christ, will wear away, or decay as well as the other? Then I must tell thee, Christ remains the same to Day as Yesterday, and never decays; but is the Saints Heavenly Food in all Generations, thro' which they have Life.</HI> To this the Jesuit reply'd no more, but let the Thing fall; for he perceived that those which were present, saw his Error, and that he could not defend it. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>why the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>did persecute, and put People to Death for Religion?</HI> And he answered, <HI>It was not the Church did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the Magistrates. G. Fox</HI> asked, <HI>whether those Magistrates were not counted and called Believers and Christians? Yes,</HI> said he. <HI>Are they not Mem∣bers of your Church?</HI> asked <HI>G. Fox. Yes,</HI> said the Jesuit. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> left it to the People to judge, <HI>whether the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>did not persecute, and put People to Death for Religion.</HI> And thus they parted; the Jesuit's Subtilty being comprehended by the Simplicity of <HI>G.

<P>BE, still and cool in thy own Mind and Spirit from thy own Thoughts, and then thou wilt feel the Principle of God, to turn thy Mind to the Lord God, from whom Life comes; whereby thou may'st receive his Strength and Power to allay all blustering Storms and Tempests. That is it which works up into Patience, into Innocency, into Soberness, into Stilness, into Stayedness, into Quietness, up to God with his Power. Therefore mind, that is the Word of the Lord unto thee, that the Authority of God thou may'st feel and thy Faith in that, to work down that which troubles thee: For that is it which keeps Peace, and brings up the Witness in thee, which hath been transgressed, to feel after God with his Power and Life, who is a God of Order and Peace. When thou art in the Transgression of the Life of God in thy own particular, the Mind flies up in the Air, and the Creature is led into the Night, and Na∣ture goes out of its Course, and an old Garment goes on, and an uppermost Clothing, and thy Nature being led out of its Course, it comes to be all on a Fire, in the Transgression; and that defaceth the Glory of the first Body. Therefore be still a while from thy own Thoughts, searching, seeking, Desires, and Imaginations, and be stayed in the Principle of God in thee, that it may raise thy Mind up to God, and stay it upon God, and thou wilt find Strength from him, and find him to be a God at hand, a present Help in the Time of Trouble, and of Need. And thou being come to the Principle of God, which hath been transgressed, it will keep thee humble; and the Humble God will teach his Way, which is Peace, and such he doth exalt. Now as the Principle of God in thee hath been transgressed, come to it, that it may keep thy Mind down
<PB N="177" REF="003104_0188_0FEFF4A148AFA9D0"/>
low to the Lord God; and deny thy self, and from thy own Will, that is the earthly, thou must be kept: Then thou wilt feel the Power of God, which will bring Nature into its Course, and give thee to see the Glory of the first Body. And there the Wisdom of God will be received (which is Christ, by which all Things were made and created) to be thereby preserved and ordered to God's Glory. There thou wilt come to receive and feel the Phy∣sician of Value, who clothes People in their right Mind; whereby they may serve God, and do his Will. For all Distractions, Un∣ruliness, and Confusion is in the Transgression; which Transgression must be brought down, before the Principle of God, which hath been transgressed against, be lifted up; whereby the Mind may be season∣ed and stilled, and a right Understanding of the Lord may be recei∣ved; whereby his Blessings enter, and are felt, over all that is con∣trary, in the Power of the Lord God, which raiseth up the Principle of God within, and gives a Feeling after God, and in Time gives Dominion. Therefore keep in the Fear of the Lord God; that is the Word of the Lord God unto thee; for all these Things happen to thee for thy Good, and for the Good of those concerned for thee, to make you know your selves, and your own Weakness, and that ye may know the Lord's Strength and Power, and may trust in him. Therefore let the Time that is past be sufficient to every one, who in any Thing hath been lifted up in Transgression, out of the Pow∣er of the Lord: For he can bring down, and abase the mighty, and lay them in the Dust of the Earth. Therefore all keep low in his Fear, that thereby ye may receive the Secrets of God and his Wisdom, and may know the Shadow of the Almighty, and sit under it in all Tempests, Storms, and Heats. For God is a God at Hand, and the Most-High rules in the Children of Men. So then this is the Word of the Lord God unto you all, what the Light doth make manifest and discover, as Temptations, Distractions, Con∣fusions; do not look at the Temptation, Confusions, Corruptions, but at the Light which discovers them, and makes them manifest. And with the same Light you may feel over them, to receive Pow∣er to stand against them. The same Light which lets you see Sin and Transgression, will let you see the Covenant of God, which blots out your Sin and Transgression, which gives Victory and Dominion over it, and brings into Covenant with God. For looking down at Sin, and Corruption and Distraction, ye are swallowed up in it: But looking at the Light which discovers them, ye will see over them: That will give Victory, and ye will find Grace and Strength; and there is the first Step to Peace. That will bring Salvation, and by it ye may see to the Beginning, and the <HI>Glory that was with the Father before the World began;</HI> and so come to know the Seed of God, which is the Heir of the Promise of God, and of the World which hath no End, and which bruises the Head of the Serpent, who stops People from coming to God. That ye may feel the Power of an end∣less Life, the Power of God which is immortal, which brings the immortal Soul up to the immortal God, in whom it doth rejoice. So in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Name and Power of the Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty strengthen thee.</P>

much persecuted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G F.</HI> writes about Fasts to the Protector and chief Ma∣gistrates.</NOTE> there came forth a Declaration from the Protector to keep a Fast, and one also for a Collection for the Relief of distress'd Protestant Churches. On this Occasion, <HI>G. Fox,</HI> to shew what Kind of Fast it was, that God requires and accepts, wrote the following Paper.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="paper">
<HEAD>To the Heads and Governors of this Nation, who have put forth a <HI>Declaration</HI> for the keeping of a Day of Solemn <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Humiliation,</HI> for the Persecution <HI>(as you say)</HI> of divers Peo∣ple beyond the Seas, professing the reformed Religion, which, <HI>ye say,</HI> hath been transmitted unto them from their Ancestors.</HEAD>
<P>A Profession of the reformed Religion may be transmitted to Gene∣rations, and so holden by Tradition; and in that, wherein the Profession and Tradition is holden, is the Day of Humiliation kept; which stands in the Will of Man, which is not the Fast that the Lord requires, <HI>to bow down the Head like a Bulrush for a Day,</HI> and the Day following be in the same Condition as they were the Day be∣fore. To the Light of Christ Jesus in your Consciences do I speak, which testifieth for God every Day, and witnesseth against all Sin and Persecution; which Measure of God, if ye be guided by it, doth not limit God to a Day, but leads to the Fast which the Lord requires, which is, <HI>To loose the Bonds of Wickedness, to undo the heavy Burdens, to break every Yoke, and to let the Oppressed go free,</HI> Isa. lviii. 6, 7. This is the Fast the Lord requires; and this stands not in the Transmission of Times, nor in the Traditions of Men: But this stands in that which was before Times were, and which leads out of Time, and shall be, when Time shall be no more. And these that teach for Doctrine the Commandments of Men, are they that ever persecuted the Life and Power when it came. And where∣as ye mention a Decree or Edict, that was made against the said persecuted Protestants; all such Decrees or Edicts proceed from the Ground of the Pope's Religion and Supremacy, and therein stands his Tyranny and Cruelty, acted in that Will, which is in that Na∣ture, which exerciseth Lordship over one another, (as you may read, <HI>Mark</HI> x. 42. <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 25.) as all the Heathen do, and ever did; and in the Heathenish Nature is all the Tyranny and Persecution ex∣ercised, by them that are out of the Obedience to the Light of Christ Jesus in the Conscience, which is the Guider and Leader of all who are tender of that of God in the Conscience. But who are not led by this, know not what it is to suffer for Conscience sake. Now, whereas ye take into your Consideration the sad Persecution, Tyranny, and Cruelty exercised upon them, whom ye call your Protestant Brethren, and do contribute and administer to their Wants outwardly; this is good in its Place, and we own it, and see it good to administer to the Necessities of others, and to do good to all: And we who are Sufferers by a Law derived from the Pope, are willing to join, and to contribute with you to their outward <HI>Necessities. For the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness thereof;</HI> who is good to all and gra∣cious to all, and willing that all should be saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth. But in the mean Time, while ye are doing this, and taking Notice of others Cruelty, Tyranny, and Persecution, turn your Eye upon your selves, and see what ye are doing at home. To the Light of Christ Jesus in all your Consciences I speak, which cannot lie, nor cannot err, nor cannot bear false witness; but doth bear Witness for God, and cries for Equity, and Justice, and Righ∣teousness
<PB N="179" REF="003104_0190_0FEFF4A30D8F7750"/>
to be executed. See what ye are doing who profess the Scriptures which were given forth by the Saints in Light, who dwelt in the Light and in the Life of them. For them who do now witness the same Light, the same Life, and the same Power which gave forth the Scriptures, which ye in Words profess, them ye persecute, them ye hale out of your Synagogues and Markets; them ye beat, stock, and imprison. Now let that of God in your Consciences, which is just and righteous, and equal, examine and try, whether ye have any Example or Precedent to exercise this Per∣secution, which now many in this Nation suffer under, who are a People harmless and innocent, walking in Obedience towards God and Man: And tho' ye account the Way of Truth they walk in, Heresy; yet therein do they exercise themselves to have always a <HI>Conscience void of Offence towards God and Man,</HI> as ye may read the Saints of old did, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiv. 14, 15, 16. not wronging any Man, neither giving any just Cause of Offence; only being obedient to the Commands of the Lord, to declare, as they are moved by the Holy Ghost; and standing for the Testimony of a good Conscience, speak∣ing the Truth in Christ, their Consciences bearing them witness that they lie not: For this do they suffer under you, who in Words profess the same Thing for which they suffer. Now see if any Age or Ge∣neration did ever persecute as ye do: For ye profess Christ Jesus who reveals the Father, and persecute them that witness the Revelati∣on of the Father by Christ Jesus unto them. Ye profess Christ Jesus, who is the Light of the World, <HI>that enlightens every one that cometh into the World,</HI> and yet persecute them that bear witness and give Testimony to this Light. Ye profess that the Word is become Flesh, and yet per∣secute them that witness it so. Ye profess that whosoever confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is an Antichrist, and yet persecute them that do confess him come in the Flesh, and call them Antichrists and Deceivers. Ye profess that the Kingdom of Christ is come, and yet persecute them that witness it come. Ye profess Christ Jesus the Resurrection and the Life, and yet persecute them that wit∣ness him to be so. If ye say, <HI>How shall we know that these People who say they witness these Things, do so, or no?</HI> I answer, Turn your Minds to the Light which Christ Jesus hath enlightned you withal, which is one in all; and if ye walk in the Light, ye shall have the Light of Life, and then ye will know and see what ye have done, who have persecuted the Lord of Glory (in his People) in whom is Life, and the Life is the Light of Men. To no other Touchstone shall we turn you, but into your own Consciences, and there shall ye find the Truth of what we have declared unto you, and of what we bear Testimony to, according to the Holy Scriptures. And when the Books of Consciences are opened, and all judged out of them, then shall ye witness us to be of God, and our Testimony to be true; tho' now ye may stop your Ears, and harden your Hearts, while it is called to Day: But then ye shall know what ye have done, and whom ye have transgressed against; and then ye will see that no Persecutors in any Age or Generation that ever went before you, did ever transgress against that Light and Measure of God made manifest, in such Manner as ye have done. For tho' Christ and the Apostles were persecuted in their Times, the <HI>Jews,</HI> for the most Part of them, did not know that he was the Christ, when he came, notwithstanding that they had the Scriptures, which prophe∣sied of him; neither did they believe that he was risen again, when the Apostles preached his Resurrection. But ye say, <HI>Ye believe he is come;</HI> and ye say, <HI>Ye believe his Resurrection,</HI> and yet ye persecute
<PB N="180" REF="003104_0191_0FEFF4E7441F86D8"/>
those that witness him come in the Flesh, those that are buried with him in Baptism, those that are conformable to his Death, and know the Power of his Resurrection, those ye persecute, those ye hale before Magistrates, and suffer to be beaten in your Synagogues; those ye cause to be whipp'd and stock'd, and shamefully entreated, and into Prison cast, and kept, as many Jails in this Nation at this Day testify to your Faces. Therefore honestly consider what ye are doing, while ye are taking Notice of others Cruelties, lest ye over-look your own. There is some Difference in many Things be∣tween the Popish Religion, and that which ye call the Protestant; but in this Persecution of yours there is no Difference: For ye will confess, that the Foundation of your Religion is grounded upon the Scriptures; and yet now ye are persecuting them that be in the same Life which they were in who spake forth the Scriptures; your selves being the mean while under a Profession of the Words they spake; and this ye shall one Day witness. So ye have a Profession and Form, and persecute them that are in the Possession, Life, and Power. There∣fore know assuredly, that ye must come to Judgment; for he is made manifest to whom all Judgment is committed. Therefore to the Light of Christ Jesus in your Consciences, which searcheth and tri∣eth you, turn your Minds, and stand still, and wait there to receive the righteous Law, which is according to that of God in the Conscience which is now rising, and is bearing witness against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of Men; and they whom ye persecute, are manifest to God, and that of God in all Consciences shall bear Witness for us, that we are of God: And this ye shall one Day witness, whe∣ther ye will hear, or forbear. Our Rejoicing is in the Testimony of our Consciences, that in Simplicity, and godly Sincerity, (not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of God) we have had our Conver∣sation in the World, not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but in the Manifestation of the Truth; commending our selves to every Man's Conscience in the Sight of God: And if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: And for the witnessing the holding the Mystery of Faith in a pure Conscience, do we suffer, and are sub∣ject for Conscience-Sake. This is thank-worthy, if a Man for Conscience-sake endure Griefs and suffering wrongfully. And in this is our Joy and Rejoicing, having a good Conscience, that whereas we are evil spoken of, as Evil-doers, they may be ashamed, that falsely accuse our good Conversation in Christ; which is not only the putting a∣way of the Filth of the Flesh, but the Answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. And this we wit∣ness made manifest, (eternal Praises to the living God) and bear Te∣stimony to that which spake it in the Apostle in Life and Power. And therefore do we bear witness, and testify against those, who being got into a Form and Profession of it, do persecute the Life and Power. Therefore to the eternal Light of Christ Jesus, the Searcher and Trier of all Hearts, turn your Minds, and see what ye are doing, lest ye overturn your Foundation and Bottom whereon ye pretend to stand, while ye are professing the Scriptures, and persecuting the Life, Light, and Power which they were in who gave them forth. For the Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands, is now stri∣king at the Feet of the Image, the Profession which is set up, and stands in the Will of Man. Now is that made manifest unto which all must answer, and appear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ; that every one may receive the Thing done in his Body, accor∣ding to that he hath done, whether it be good, or bad. Know∣ing therefore the Terror of the Lord, we perswade Men; but we
<PB N="181" REF="003104_0192_0FEFF4A616492F58"/>
are made manifest unto God, and shall be made manifest in all your Consciences, which ye shall witness.</P>

<P>Divers Times when a Fast was proclaimed, <HI>G. Fox</HI> wrote on that Subject; and since commonly some Mischief was then contriv'd against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> no Wonder that he would say, that these Fasts were like to <HI>Jezabel</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Now many of his Friends being at this Time in Prisons and Dun∣geons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Friends offer to lie in Prison for their Bre∣thren, but are repulsed and threatned.</NOTE> several others of them went to the Parliament, and offered to lie in the same Prisons where their Brethren lay, that so those that were in Prison might not perish in stinking Dungeons, and their Per∣secutors bring innocent Blood thereby upon their own Heads. But this could not be obtained; for those of the Parliament sometimes threatned these compassionate Men that thus attended them, with Whipping, if they did not desist. And because the Parliament then sitting consisted mostly of such who pretending to be more religious than others, were indeed Persecutors of those who were truly religi∣ous, <HI>G.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>O Friends, do not cloak and cover your selves; there is a God that knoweth your Hearts, and that will uncover you. He seeth your Way; Woe be to him that covereth, but not with my Spirit saith the Lord. Do ye do contrary to the Law, and then put it from you? Mercy and true Judgment ye neglect. Look, what was spoken against such: My Saviour spake against such: <HI>I was sick and ye visited me not; I was hungry, and ye fed me not; I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in; I was in Prison, and ye visited me not.</HI> But they said, <HI>When saw we thee in Prison, and did not come to thee?

<P>O! remember this, every one of you, and come to the Witness of God in you, and be humble, and meek, and lowly, and let the Lord's Fear be in your Hearts, and be of a tender Spirit, having your Minds exercised in Purity, in Holiness, and in Righteousness; and exalt not your selves, nor be lifted up in your Hearts, in the Pride and Vain∣glories, and Honours of this World, lest the Lord cast you down, and make your Name and Posterity a Reproach, as he hath done many be∣fore you; and if you walk in the same Steps, and do the same Things, and become guilty of the same Abominations, and suffer the Chil∣dren and Servants of the Lord to be persecuted (as many are at this Day, some until Death) shall the Lord spare you? Nay, he will cause you to feel his Hand of Judgment, and bring you down with Sor∣row, and he will vex you in his Wrath, and smite you with his Rod more and more, till you learn his Fear, and depart from all your Iniquities; and the Lord will deface your Glory, and pull down your Crown; and he will make you know, that he is Lord, that doth whatsoever he will.</P>
<P>Wherefore humble your selves under the Hand of God, and search your own Hearts, and cast out the Abominations that vex the Spirit of the Lord; and suffer not the People of the Lord's precious Flock to be devour'd, and made a Prey to the Wicked; for because of this, the Rod of Affliction cometh upon you, and may suddenly break you to Pieces: But mind the Seed of God, in you, which is oppressed, and wait to know the Power of the Lord, which will re∣deem you out of Sin and Death, and reconcile you to God, and bring you into Fellowship with himself, to enjoy Peace and Rest for your Souls, that you may be made Heirs of the Inheritance of an endless Life; and this would make you truly honourable, and will be more Satisfaction to you, and Joy, and Content, and true Rejoicing, than all worldly Crowns and Worldly Glories, which will waste and consume away, and leave you miserable: And remember that you are now warned from the Lord God, by whom I am moved to write this unto you, in dear and tender Love to you all; and one Day you shall witness it.</P>

to Death, whose Sufferings cry for Vengeance, and the Lord heareth the Cry: <HI>Wherefore save your selves, and let the Innocent be delivered, and the cruel Bonds of Oppression broken, and the Exercise of a pure Conscience go free, without Persecution; and then the Lord will turn away his Anger, and cease to smite you with his Rod, which hath been upon you; and he will give you Peace, and make you blessed, if you come to be led by his Spirit into all Truth.</HI> And tho' these innocent Lambs of Christ suffer thus under this present Power, yet are they not Enemies to you, but are Friends to your Persons and Families, and pity you, and love you, and desire well for you in the Lord, that you may repent, and be healed, and even that your Hearts may be opened, to receive Refreshments to your Souls, and that you may be established in Righteousness and Truth over all your Enemies, and may not be confounded, nor your Posterity brought into Reproach, which is hastening upon you: And tho' our Love be despised, and we accounted hateful in your Sight, and looked upon with Derision, yet we bear all Things in Patience, truly desiring your Returning and Repentance, and not your Destruc∣tion: <HI>But if these doleful Sufferings of the Lord's poor Lambs be continued by this present Power, it will destroy you, and undo you, and break you, and confound you; and the Lord will not cease to smite you with his Rod of sharp Rebukes; and he will make you know, his People's Cause shall not be unpu∣nished.</HI> Oh, did you but know how Hundreds have, and do suffer! How the Bodies of some have been tortur'd by Stocks, and cruel Whippings! and how some lie sick in stinking Holes and Dungeons on the Ground, or a little Straw at best; Ten, or often more, in a Prison together, and sometimes their own Friends not suffer'd to come to visit them with Necessaries! Oh, did but your Eyes behold, or your Hearts perceive the Greatness of the Cruelty, which some of the Lord's dear Servants, and your faithful Friends undergo, it would make your Hearts ake, and your Spirits to tremble! And all this is done in the Name, and under the Authority of (Protector;) therefore how should the Lord but lay it to your Charge, and af∣flict him and his Family? <HI>He will make you know there is a God that can do whatsoever he will, and that Life and Death are in his Hands, and all Creatures are as Clay in the Hands of the Potter; and he rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and putteth down one, and setteth up another, according to his Pleasure:</HI> But if the Love of God be withholden from you, it is because of Disobedience to him, and your Transgression. Wherefore be obedient to him, and love his Ways and Judgments, that he may make you more happy with a Crown immortal, that never fades away. And remember once more the Lord hath war∣ned you, by a Friend unto you in the Lord.</P>

<P><HI>Cromwel</HI> was snatch'd away by Death at unawares; however the Day before his Decease, this Letter was delivered to his Relations. It was not but in the last Period of his Life that he named his Son <HI>Richard</HI> to be his Successor. And when Death look'd in his Face,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwel</HI> names his Son <HI>Richard</HI> his Successor.</NOTE> Re∣morse did not stay behind; for, according to what <HI>Ludlow</HI> relates, he seem'd above all, concern'd for the Reproaches (he said) Men would cast upon his Name, in trampling on his Ashes when dead. In this Temper of Mind he departed this Life about two in the Afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And dies.</NOTE> on the 3d of <HI>September,</HI> at the Age of about Fifty five Years. The News of his Death being brought to those who were met together to pray for him, one <HI>Sterry</HI> stood up, and said, <HI>This is good News; be∣cause

cause if he was of great Ʋse to the People of God when he was amongst us, now he will be much more so, being ascended to Heaven, there to intercede for us.</HI> O horrid Flattery!<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrid Flat∣tery of one <HI>Sterry.</HI></NOTE> Thus I call it, tho' he had been the great∣est Saint on Earth, which he came much short of, tho' he was once endued with some eminent Vertues. His dying Day was remarkable by a most grievous Tempest, not only in <HI>England,</HI> but also in the low Countries, where Trees were torn out of the Ground by the Violence of the Wind, and many Ships foundered. <Q>He was, saith <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> one of those Persons whom even his Enemies could not vilify,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Saying of <HI>Crom∣wel.</HI></NOTE> without praising him.</Q> And I have heard impartial Men say, that in the Beginning of his Atchievements, he was an excel∣lent Man; but being come to a high Station, he soon lost that Zeal for the publick Welfare, by which at first he seem'd to be animated.</P>
<P>The Body of the Deceased was laid in <HI>Somerset-House,</HI> in an A∣partment enlightned only with Wax Tapers, the Corps being richly adorn'd.</P>
<P>After his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His eldest Son <HI>Richard</HI> pro∣claimed.</NOTE> <HI>Richard,</HI> eldest Son to <HI>Oliver,</HI> was proclaimed Pro∣tector of the Common-wealth; to whom <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> wrote a Letter, superscribed to <HI>Richard Cromwel,</HI> chosen to be Protector and chief Ma∣gistrate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein he gave some Account of the most cruel Suffer∣ings of his Friends; and speaking of the Rulers, he saith thus:</P>
<P><HI>As for Magistracy, it was ordained of God to be a Dread, and Terror, and Limit to Evil-doers, and to be a Defence and Praise to all that do well; to condemn the guilty, and to justify the guiltless; but the Exercise thereof at this Day in these Nations is degenerated, and some that are in Authority are greatly corrupted, and regard not the just and pure Law of God, to judge only thereby; but oppress the Poor by Injustice, and subvert the good Laws of God and Men to a wrong End and Ʋse, abusing Authority, and turning the Sword against the Just, whereby true Judgment is turned backward, and the Innocent made unjustly to suffer for Righteousness-sake, thro' the Corruption of Men in Authority; and didst thou but know what we know in this Particular, it would pierce thy Heart: Why? It is frequent among some of the Judges and Magi∣strates,</HI> to commit a Man to Prison, and impose some great Fine upon him, and to cast him into a Dungeon, or Hole, among Thieves and Murderers, for a long Season, for no other Offence, or Breach of any Law, but because he cannot put off his Hat to them, and respect their Persons, by the Hat, or bowing the Knee: <HI>And many others that fear God, and for Conscience-sake cannot swear upon a Book by kissing it, and laying Hand upon it, because Christ saith,</HI> Swear not at all; <HI>tho' they deny not to speak and do the Truth in all Things, as in the Presence of God and all Men: And many others, that because they are moved to cry against Sin, and de∣clare against the Iniquities of the Times in Teachers, Rulers and People, that highly abound, perhaps in a Market, or Steeple-house, or Highway, or other Places, as they are moved of God: And many others, because for Conscience-sake they cannot pay Tythes, nor give Money and Wages to maintain a Priest, or false Teacher, that they receive no Profit by: or to maintain a Steeple-house, where the World worships in vain Traditions, and not in the Spirit and Power of God. And many have been taken out of peaceable Meetings, where they were waiting upon the Lord; and some out of their Inns and Friend's Houses; and many have been taken on the Way, travelling about their lawful Occasions; and some from their Callings and Labours; and for these Causes, thro' the Envy of wicked Men, and without any just Conviction of the Breach of any Law, or any lawful Trial or Examination, have Hundreds of just Men, being wholly innocent, been sent to Prison, and lain many Months, and some for Years, or whipt, or put in the Stocks, and grievously abused by cruel Executioners of wicked Mens Envy and Injustice; and upon such Grounds
<PB N="187" REF="003104_0198_0FEFF4ADB91071B8"/>
only, and for such Causes mentioned, and without the Transgression of any just Law, have and do at this Day many Hundreds of faithful Sub∣jects suffer hard and cruel Things, long and sore Imprisonment, and cruel and sharp Whipping, and Stocking, and unjust Banishment out of Towns and Cities; yea, Friend, it's hard to be expressed, and large to be declared, how many of the Lord's Servants do, and have suffered great Injustice in these Nations, thro' the Abuse of good Government, and Degeneration of Magistracy, from its per∣fect State and Place, whereunto it was ordained of God in the Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>This Remonstration, how powerful and large soever, had not it due Effect; but Persecution continued, without being stopt by him▪ For the Churchmen fawned upon him, calling him not only their <HI>Jo∣shua,</HI> but the Preachers of <HI>Suffolk</HI> said in their Address to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Suffolk</HI> Prea∣chers Address to <HI>Richard.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tho' our Sun is gone down, yet no Night ensued.</HI></P>
<P>About this Time was given forth a Paper, called, <HI>The Church-Faith;</HI> and <HI>G. Fox</HI> having got a Copy of it before it was published,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> An∣swers a Paper called <HI>Church-Faith.</HI></NOTE> writ an Answer to it; and when the Book of the <HI>Church-Faith</HI> appeared, his Answer was also in Print. This so incensed some of the Parliament-men, that one of them told <HI>G. Fox, They must have him to</HI> Smithfield. To which he answered, <HI>That he was over their Fires, and feared them not:</HI> And farther ask'd, <HI>Whether all People had been without a Faith these sixteen Hundred Years, that now the Priest must make them one? And since Christ Je∣sus was the Author of the Apostle's Faith, and of the Church's Faith in the pri∣mitive Times, and of the Martyrs Faith, should not all People look unto him to be the Author and Finisher of their Faith, and not unto the Priests?</HI> Nothing material was answered to this; for the Priests called <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Friends, <HI>House-Creepers,</HI> because they met together in Houses, and would not maintain the Priests Temples. One Major <HI>Wiggan,</HI> that was present when <HI>G. Fox</HI> discoursed with the Parliament-man, said, <HI>Christ had taken away the Guilt of Sin, but had left the Power of Sin remaining in us.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, that <HI>this was strange Doctrine; for Christ came to destroy the Devil and all his Works, and the Power of Sin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Confutes Ma∣jor <HI>Wiggan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>and so to cleanse Men from Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Now there was great Persecution, both by Imprisonment, and break∣ing up of Meetings; and many died in Prisons: For the Priests speak∣ing Evil of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> it did kindle the Insolency of the Rabble not a little, so that they did not stick to throw Squibs into the Meetings, to cast rotten Eggs on those that were met, to beat on Drums and Kettles, and so to make a hideous Noise, and to abuse People most grievously with Blows and violent Pushes.</P>
<P>One Day there being a Meeting appointed near <HI>London,</HI> they beat and abused about eighty Persons that came out of the City to meet there, tearing their Coats and Cloaks from off their Backs, and throw∣ing them into Ditches and Ponds. The next First-day of the Week after this, <HI>G. Fox,</HI> tho' at that Time very weak, went thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> preach∣es and shews rude People the Fruits of their Preach∣ers Doctrine.</NOTE> and preaching with the Bible in his Hand, he shewed the rude People their, and their Teachers Fruits, and how disagreeable these mad Actions were to the Doctrine contained in the holy Scriptures. Ma∣ny of his imprisoned Friends were now brought up to <HI>London</HI> to be tried by the Committee; where <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> being Chairman,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. Vane,</HI> all first refuses Friends Admittance, without put∣ting off their Hats, till pre∣vail'd on by others.</NOTE> would not suffer them to come in, except they would put off their Hats. But since many of them had been imprisoned upon <HI>Contempts,</HI> as the not putting off Hats before Magistrates was called, others signified, that it must not be expected that now they should comply; and so thro' the Mediation of some that perswaded <HI>Vane,</HI> they were at length admitted; where they so well defended their Cause, that several were set at Liberty.</P>

<P>There was at that Time great Discord among those that were at the Helm of Government; and <HI>G.

<P>How the Corps of <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> was laid in <HI>Somerset-House</HI> to be seen, hath been said already; but afterwards an Image of him ly∣ing there in State, was accompanied with Trumpeters, who sounded over the said Image. This Vanity so grieved <HI>G. Fox,</HI> that he writ the following Lines to the Authors thereof.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Oh Friends, what are ye doing! and what mean you to sound before an Image! Will not all sober People think ye are like mad People? <HI>Oh, how am I grieved with your Abominations!

<P>Sometime after this, the Funeral of <HI>O. Cromwel</HI> was solemnized with very great Pomp, not at all agreeable to that Condition he once was in; for the Time was, when he would have abhorred
<PB N="189" REF="003104_0200_0FEFF51D5D4CC350"/>
such an Idolatrous Honour as was now paid to his Image. On the Day of this pompous Funeral, which was the 23d of <HI>November,</HI> it happen'd that <HI>Edward Burrough</HI> came riding from <HI>Kingston</HI> into <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E.

As he enter'd at <HI>Charing-cross,</HI> he beheld a great Multitude of People thronging exceed∣ingly, the Streets being filled as far as he could see, and Abundance gazing at the Windows, and upon the Balconies, and House-tops. There were also Guards of Horse and Foot, that stop'd his Horse, and it was told him, that he might not pass that Way. Yet he did not know what was the Matter; but at length, he perceiv'd that <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Image, richly adorn'd, was to be carried that Way towards <HI>Westmin∣ster.</HI> The Consideration of this, was like an Arrow which pierced his Breast: And because of this Idolatry, he felt such a Fire kindled in him, that he was, as it were, filled with the Indignation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord, whose Fury ran thro' him, to cry, <HI>Plagues, Plagues, and Vengeance against the Authors of this Abomination.</HI> Nay, so ardent was his Zeal, that if he had been moved to it, and it had been possible to have done it, he could, (not at all minding his own Life) have ridden thro' the Guards, and Multitude, to have founded the Judgments of God against the Idola∣ters. And considering that all this sinful Idolatry was about the Fu∣neral of <HI>Oliver Cromwel: Alas for him,</HI> (said <HI>Burrough</HI> with himself) <HI>who was once a great Instrument in the Hand of the Lord, to break down many ido∣latrous Images! Did not the Lord once stir up his Heart against all such Things? And did not once his Children, Officers, Soldiers, and Army, pull down all the Images and Crosses, and all such-like Popish Stuff, where-ever they met with it? What grievous and abominable Work is this? Have they now made a costly Image of him? And are such as were once his Soldiers now guarding it, and watching over it, and his Children and Officers following it, and Multitudes of the Inhabitants of</HI> London <HI>wandering and gazing after an Image of him?

In the mean Time, the Deputy Go∣vernor <HI>Richard Bellingham</HI> did not stick to say to <HI>William</HI>'s Wife, that since he was poor, and could not pay five Shillings a Week for not coming to Church, they would continue him in Prison. Thus was ve∣rified that Saying of <HI>Solomon, Cruel are the Mercies of the Wicked. Bel∣lingham</HI> also endeavoured to persuade this Woman, that what her Hus∣band had done, was to be rid of her, and therefore advised her to dis∣own him. Now these Persecutors began to have abundance of Business; and taking a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay of Goods, and cruel Whippings became almost daily Work, which was performed without Regard of Age or Sex; all which to relate would exceed my Limits.</P>
<P>Two women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbarous Usage of two Women.</NOTE> named <HI>Sarah Gibbons,</HI> and <HI>Dorothy Waugh,</HI> being come to <HI>Boston,</HI> and having in the publick Meeting-place, after the Lecture was ended, spoken a few Words, were brought to the House of Cor∣rection, and three Days before their being whipt, and three Days after, were kept from Victuals, tho' they had offered to pay for them. And when <HI>Sarah</HI> afterwards ask'd the Governor <HI>John Endicot, Whether this was Justice or Equity?</HI> adding, <HI>That by this all might see that God was with them, that they were preserved without Food; and if they perished, their Blood would fall heavy on those that were the Occasion thereof.</HI> He answer'd, <HI>That he matter'd it not.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Girl whipt and a Woman who prays for her Presecu∣tors.</NOTE> <HI>Hored Gardner,</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Newport</HI> in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> came with her sucking Babe, and a Girl to carry it to <HI>Weymouth;</HI> from whence, for being a <HI>Quaker,</HI> she was hurried to <HI>Boston,</HI> where both she, and the Girl were whipped with a threefold knotted Whip. After whipping, the Woman kneeled down, and prayed the Lord <HI>to forgive those Persecutors:</HI> Which so reached a Woman that stood by, that she said, <HI>Surely she could not have done this, if it had not been by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But when should I have done, if I would describe all the Whippings inflicted on the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called, in those Parts! For now a Law was made, which furnished continual Work to the Persecutors there.

And whosoever should entertain them, knowing them to be so, should forfeit forty Shillings to the Country for every Hour's entertaining or Concealment, and be committed to Prison till the Forfeiture should be fully paid and satisfied. And farther, that all and every of those People that should arise among them there, should be dealt withal, and suffer the like Punishment as the Laws provided for those that came in,</HI> Viz. <HI>That for the first Offence, if a Male, one of his Ears should be cut off, and be kept at Work in the House of Correction, till he should be sent away on his own Charge. For the second, the other Ear, and be kept in the House of Cor∣rection as aforesaid.

And for the third, He or she should have their Tongues bored thro' with an hot Iron, and be kept in the House of Correction, close at Work, till they be sent away on their own Charge.</HI></P>
<P>In the latter Part of the Fifth Month, it came to pass, that <HI>William Brend</HI> and <HI>William Leddra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Men have a Confe∣rence with a Priest.</NOTE> having been at <HI>Salem,</HI> came to <HI>Newbury,</HI> where at the House of one <HI>Robert Adams</HI> they had a Conference with the

<P>Now altho' nothing could be objected against this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And are sent to the House of Correction, notwithstan∣ding Captain <HI>Gerish</HI>'s Pro∣mise to the contrary.

But they unwilling to submit thereto, the Jailor, who sought his Profit from the Work of his Prisoners, would not give them Victuals, tho' they offered to pay for them. But he told them, <HI>It was not their Money, but their Labour he desired.</HI> Thus he kept them five Days without Food, and then with a three-corded Whip gave them twenty Blows.

The next Morning he brought them to the Mill to work, but <HI>Brend</HI> refusing, the Jailor took a pitch'd Rope about an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch thick, and gave him twenty Blows over the Back and Arms, with as much Force as he could, so that the Rope untwisted; and then going away, he came again with another Rope that was thicker and stronger, and told <HI>Brend, that he would cause him to bow to the Law of the Country, and make him work. Brend</HI> judged this not only unreasonable in the highest Degree, since he had committed no Evil; but he was also altogether unable to work; for he wanted Strength for want of Food, having been kept five Days without eating, and whipt also, and now thus unmercifully beaten with a Rope. But this inhuman Jailor relented not, but began to beat anew with his pitch'd Rope, on this bruised Body, and foaming at his Mouth like a Mad-man, with Violence laid fourscore and seven∣teen Blows more on him, as other Prisoners who beheld it with Com∣passion, have told; and if his Strength, and his Rope had not failed him, he would have laid on more; he threatned also to give him the next Morning as many Blows more. But a higher Power, who sets Limits even to the raging Sea, and hath said, <HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther,</HI> also limited this butcherly Fellow, who was yet impudently stout enough to say his Morning-prayer. To what a most terrible Condition these Blows brought the Body of <HI>Brend,</HI> (who be∣cause of the great Heat of the Weather, had nothing but a Serge Cas∣sock upon his Shirt) may easily be conceived: His Back and Arms were bruised and black, and the Blood hanging as in Bags under his
<PB N="192" REF="003104_0203_0FEFD562F4989980"/>
Arms; and so into one was his Flesh beaten, that the Sign of a parti∣cular blow could not be seen; for all was become as a Jelly. His Bo∣dy being thus cruelly tortured, he lay down upon the Boards, so ex∣treamly weakened, that the natural Parts decaying, and Strength quite failing, his Body turned cold: There seemed as it were a Struggle be∣tween Life and Death, his Senses were stopped; and he had for some Time neither Seeing, Feeling, nor Hearing: Till at length a divine Power prevailing, Life broke thro' Death, and the Breath of the Lord was breathed into his Nostrils. Now the Noise of this Cruelty spread among the People in the Town, and caused such a Cry, that the Go∣vernor sent his Surgeon to the Prison to see what might be done: But the Surgeon found the Body of <HI>Brend</HI> in such a deplorable Condition, that, as one without Hopes, he said, <HI>His Flesh would rot off his Bones, ere the bruised Parts could be brought to digest.</HI> This so exasperated the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Magi∣strates seem to relent in their Cruelty.</NOTE> that the Rulers to prevent a Tumult, set up a Paper on their Meeting-house Door, and up and down the Streets, as it were, to shew their Dislike of this abominable, and most barbarous Cruelty; and said, the Jaylor should be dealt withal the next Court. But this Paper was soon taken down again upon the Instigation of the High-Priest <HI>John Norton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But are con∣firm'd therein by their Priests.</NOTE> (who having from the Beginning been a fierce Promoter of the Persecution,) now did not stick to say, <HI>W. Brend endeavour'd to beat our Gospel-Ordinance black and blue; if he then be beaten black and blue, it is but just upon him; and I will appear in his Behalf that did so.</HI> It is therefore not much to be wondered at, that these precise and bigotted Rulers, who would be look'd upon to be eminent for Piety, were so cruel in persecuting, since their chief Teacher thus wickedly encouraged them to it. In the mean while, it pleased God, even miraculously to heal <HI>W. Brend,</HI> and to keep him alive: But as if the Hearts of these Perse∣cutors were more hardened thereby, to shew themselves obedient Followers of their Teacher, they made an Order, that the Jailor, if the <HI>Quakers</HI> that were in his Custody refused to work, should whip them twice a Week, the first Time with Ten Lashes, the next Time with fifteen, and so at each Time with three more, till they would work. This was performed on Four Persons, two of which were <HI>Wil∣liam Leddra</HI> and <HI>John Rous,</HI> who may be mentioned hereafter. And to keep the passionate Jailor within due Bonds, forsooth, it was ordered that each Time he should warn two Constables to see the Execution. But how little Moderation was truly meant, and that this was more like a Jest, may appear in that the Jailor the first Time laid fifteen Lashes a piece on the said Persons, and so added five Stripes to the first Number of ten.</P>
<P>It happened about this Time that some of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> that lived there, being had before the Magistrates, it was demanded by one of them, <HI>How they might know a</HI> Quaker? to which <HI>Simon Broadstreet,</HI> one of the Magistrates, answered, <HI>Thou art one, for coming in with thy Hat on.</HI> Which made the other reply, <HI>It was a horrible Thing to make such cruel Laws, to whip and cut off Ears, and bore thro' the Tongue for not putting off the Hat:</HI> Then one of the Bench said, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>held forth Blasphemies at thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Meetings.</HI> To which one of the others desired, <HI>To make such a Thing appear, if it were so; that they might be convinced:</HI> And farther, <HI>that they should do well to send some to their Meetings, that they might hear, and give Account of what was done and spoken there; and not conclude of a Thing they knew not.</HI> But, said Ma∣jor General <HI>Denison, If ye meet together and say any Thing, we may con∣clude that ye speak Blasphemy.</HI> A very strange Syllogism indeed. No better to prove Persecution lawful was the Argument of <HI>Charles Chansey,</HI> chief Teacher at the University, who in a Sermon at <HI>Boston,</HI> argued
<PB N="193" REF="003104_0204_0FEFF5230861C468"/>
thus; <HI>Suppose you should catch six Wolves in a Trap, and ye cannot prove that they killed either Sheep or Lambs; and now ye have them, they will neither bark nor bite; yet they have the plain Marks of Wolves, and therefore ye knock them down.</HI> A base Expression thus to compare a Man to a Beast; for God said in plain Terms to <HI>Noah, Whoso sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed.</HI> But these Persecutors thought there was Stress enough in it, to call the <HI>Quakers</HI> Wolves; and to make one pass for a <HI>Quaker,</HI> they counted it a sufficient Proof, when they saw he did not put off his Hat to Men: Knock him down, 'tis a Wolf: And if the Hat was not found fault with, something else was thought on; for at <HI>Salem</HI> twelve Persons were fined forty Pounds nineteen Shillings for not coming to Church:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several fined.</NOTE> And of others much Money was extorted, be∣cause their Wives absented themselves from the publick Worship. <HI>William Marston</HI> of <HI>Hampton</HI> was fined Ten Pounds for two Books found in his House, <HI>viz. John Lilburn</HI>'s <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and <HI>W. Duesbury</HI>'s <HI>Mighty Day of the Lord.</HI> Thus these People did whatever they would, with∣out any Regard to the Laws in <HI>Old England:</HI> And when once some Pri∣soners appeal'd to it, the Governor <HI>John Endicot,</HI> and his Deputy <HI>Bel∣lingham</HI> cry'd, <HI>No Appeal to</HI> England! <HI>No Appeal to</HI> England! And they seem'd to fear nothing for what they did to the <HI>Quakers;</HI> according to what Major General <HI>Denison</HI> said in open Court; <HI>This Year you'll go and complain to the Parliament; the next Year they'll send some to see how Things go; and in the third Year the Government will be chang'd.</HI> Now they not at all caring for Old <HI>England,</HI> denied also the Prisoners their Re∣quest of being tried according to the Laws of that Realm, by a Jury. And the Rulers dealing thus arbitrarily,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial by a Ju∣ry refus'd.</NOTE> the Jailor of the House of Correction did the like; for when some of his Prisoners shewed them∣selves not unwilling to work, provided that their Families should have something of the Gain, he would not allow that, unless they paid him Eight Pence from every Twelve Pence Gain: And when they re∣fused this, the Whipping-post was his Refuge.</P>
<P>But to go on; In the foregoing Year, Mention was made of <HI>John Copeland</HI> and <HI>Christopher Holder:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Copeland</HI> and <HI>C. Hold∣er</HI> taken up.</NOTE> These coming in the Sixth Month to <HI>Dedham,</HI> lodged there one Night; but the next Day were taken up by a Constable, and carried to <HI>Boston,</HI> where being brought before the Go∣vernor, he said in a Rage, <HI>Ye shall be sure to have your Ears cut off.</HI> Not long after, <HI>John Rouse</HI> came again to <HI>Boston;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Also <HI>J. Rouse.</HI></NOTE> but was shortly after taken, and committed to Prison. On the Seventeenth of <HI>September,</HI> he with <HI>Holder</HI> and <HI>Copeland</HI> were brought before the Magistrates in the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All three brought be∣fore the Ma∣gistrates in <HI>Boston,</HI> and what pass'd there.</NOTE> where the Deputy Governor told them, <HI>That they in Contempt of the Ma∣gistrates and Ministers being come there again to seduce the People, might know that whatever befell them, whether the Loss of their Ears, or of their Lives, their Blood would be upon their own Heads.</HI> They denying this, and say∣ing, <HI>That the Lord had sent them thither,</HI> the Governor <HI>Endicot</HI> said, <HI>You are greater Enemies to us, than those that come openly; since under Pretence of Peace, you come to poyson the People.</HI> Being ask'd for Proof that the Lord had sent them, they replied, <HI>That it was some Kind of Proof the Lord had sent them; because they met with such an Entertainment as Christ had told his Disciples, would be meet to them, for his Name-sake,</HI> viz. <HI>Whipping,</HI> &amp;c. To this, Major General <HI>Denison</HI> said, <HI>Then when Malefactors are whipt, they suffer for Christ's Sake.</HI> Then <HI>John Rouse,</HI> whose Father was a Lieutenant Colonel in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> said, <HI>If we were Evil-doers, the Judg∣ments of God would be heavier upon us than that which we suffer by you.</HI> To which Major <HI>Denison</HI> replied, <HI>Mr.</HI> Rouse, <HI>(for so I may call you, having heard your Father is a Gentleman) what Judgment of God do you look for greater than is upon you, to be driven from your Father's House, and to run about here as a Vagabond, with a Company of Deceivers, except you look for a Hal∣ter?</HI>
<PB N="194" REF="003104_0205_0FEFD570022FC0E0"/>
To this <HI>Rouse</HI> said, <HI>I was not driven from my Father's House, but in Obedience to the Lord I left it; and when the Lord shall have cleared me of this Land, I shall return to it again.</HI> Then <HI>Endicot</HI> called to the Secretary to read the Law; who thereupon read this Clause in it, <HI>That if any that had suffered the Law, should presume to return again, they should have one of their Ears cut off.</HI> Some more Words were spoken, and among the rest <HI>Endicot</HI> said, <HI>The</HI> Quakers <HI>have nothing to prove their Commission by, but the Spirit within them, and that is the Devil.</HI> And when one of the Prisoners said, <HI>We have seen some of your Laws, that have many Scriptures in the Mar∣gent; but what Example have you in Scripture for cutting off Ears? Endicot</HI> asked, <HI>What Scripture is there for hanging?</HI> To which <HI>Denison</HI> said scoffing, <HI>Yes, they would be crucified.</HI> Then <HI>Endicot</HI> called the three Prisoners by Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentenced to have their right Ears cut off.</NOTE> and said in great Passion: <HI>It is the Sentence of the Court, that you three have each of you his right Ear cut off by the Hangman.</HI> Then they were carried to the Prison; and on the 16th of <HI>September,</HI> the Marshal's Deputy came thither, letting as many come in as he thought meet; and when the Doors were made fast, the said Marshal read the follow∣ing Order.</P>

<P>Then the Prisoners were brought into another Room; where <HI>John Rouse,</HI> said to the Marshal, <HI>We have appealed to the chief Magistrate of</HI> Eng∣land: To which he answer'd, <HI>He had nothing to do with that. Holder</HI> said, <HI>Such Execution as this should be done publickly, and not in private;</HI> for this was contrary to the Law of <HI>England.</HI> But Captain <HI>Oliver</HI> returned, <HI>We do it in private, to keep you from tattling.</HI> Then the Executioner took <HI>Holder,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sentence executed in private.</NOTE> and when he had turned aside his Hair, and was going to cut off his Ear, the Marshal turn'd his Back on him; which made <HI>Rouse</HI> say, <HI>Turn about and see it;</HI> for so was his Order. The Marshal then, tho' fill'd with Fear, turned, and said, <HI>Yes, yes, let us look on it. Rouse,</HI> who was more undaunted than his Persecutor, suffered the like, as well as the Third, and they said, <HI>Those that do it ignorantly, we desire from our Hearts the Lord to forgive them; but for them that do it malici∣ously, let our Blood be upon their Heads; and such shall know in the Day of Account, that every Drop of our Blood shall be as heavy upon them as a Mil∣stone.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And they are afterwards whipt again.</NOTE> Afterwards these Persons were whipt again; but this Practice becoming so common in <HI>New-England,</HI> as if it was but Play, I won't detain my Reader with it.</P>
<P>Persecution being now come to the Cutting off of Ears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persecution advances.</NOTE> did not stop there, but went higher, and rested not before it came to the taking away of Lives. But to compass that, proved very difficult; for there were many honest People who abhorr'd such a Cruelty.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J.

This gave Encouragement to the Magistrates, for since the Churchmen pushed on so wicked a Business, no Scruple was made to go on with this bloody Work: And the Court of Magistrates voted it to be put in Execution by a Country-Court, which three Magistrates made up, the Majority of which might hang at Pleasure, without Trial by a Jury; a Thing not heard of in <HI>Old England:</HI> But it served the Purpose

of <HI>Norton</HI> and his Fellow-Preachers. The Court where this Law was made, consisted of twenty five Persons; and when it was put to the Vote, it was carried in the Affirmative,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Law put to the Vote, and carried by one Voice only.</NOTE> the Speaker and Eleven being on the Negative, but Thirteen on the Affirmative, so that one Vote carried it. This so troubled one <HI>Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el,</HI> when he heard it, having thro' Illness been absent, that he got to the Court, and weeping for Grief, that his Absence should occasion such a Law to pass, said, <HI>If he had not been able to go, he would have crept upon his Knees, rather than that it should have passed.</HI> But what he said proved in vain; they had now pass'd the <HI>Rubicon,</HI> and what was eagerly desired, was obtained. Yet there was a great Difference in the Court, and the Twelve that had voted in the Negative, resolved to enter their Dissents to that Law; which the others seeing, and that so many Difficulties would weak∣en their Law, they admitted this Addition, <HI>to be try'd by a special Ju∣ry,</HI> tho' a standing Law of the Country contained, <HI>That none be sentenced to Death and Banishment, but by a special Jury, and a Court of Assistants;</HI> and such a Court consisted of seven Magistrates at the least. But it was now resolved to prosecute the <HI>Quakers</HI> to Death; and all this Tri∣al, when it came to it, was but whether they were <HI>Quakers;</HI> which they judged by their coming in covered; and that they had been ba∣nished out of the Country.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS. The FIFTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Fore-part of the Year, 1659, there was great Discord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1659</HI> Publick Af∣fairs.</NOTE> and several Factions among the People in <HI>England;</HI> for some adhered to the Protector <HI>Richard,</HI> and others to the chief Members of the Long Parliament; and the Royalists made also a Party. <HI>G. Fox</HI> being under a Concern lest some young or raw People, who sometimes came amongst his Friends, might be drawn into some of those several Inte∣rests, wrote an Epistle, warning such to be careful, and not at all to meddle with any Plotting, but to consider that their Warfare was a spiritual one, not at all wanting the Use of carnal Weapons.</P>
<P>About this Time <HI>William Caton</HI> came again into <HI>Holland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Caton</HI> at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and what pass'd there.</NOTE> and (finding at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> some malicious People, who endeavoured to bring his Fellow-Believers there into Trouble, and to stir up the Mob against them, that so the <HI>Magistrates</HI> might take Occasion to look upon the <HI>Quakers</HI> as Rioters,) advised those of that Persuasion to be circumspect, and to avoid as much as possibly they could, the impending Storm. In Order thereto, it was thought meet that their religious Meetings, which on the Week-Days were kept pretty late at Night, on the First-Days of the Week should not always be kept in one Place, but sometimes in this, and at other Times in another House: Sometimes a Meeting was kept in an Alley, at the Town-Wall near the Regulars-Gate, where seve∣ral <HI>English</HI> People dwelt, from whence it was called the <HI>English Alley,</HI> and has that Name still: Hither came very rude Company, committing great Insolence. The Time before that <HI>W. Caton</HI> was in <HI>Holland,</HI> he met with an extraordinary rude Encounter at the said Place, insomuch that he seemed in Danger of his Life; for some wicked People, not daring to do their utmost in the House where he was, push'd him out of Doors; but then a Woman pulled him into her House, where he was safe, tho' at first he knew not whether he was among Friends or Foes. I yet well remember this Fact, being at that Time with my Parents in the said disturbed Meeting. Now <HI>Caton</HI> being a discreet and judicious Person, and perceiving that some of his Friends there had more of a rash Zeal than true Wisdom, advised the most moderate of them often to change Meeting-places. In the Beginning, a Meeting was kept now and then in St. <HI>John-street,</HI> so called, and afterwards on <HI>Eland</HI>'s <HI>Graff,</HI> in an Alley at the House of one <HI>Richard Langham,</HI> and also on the <HI>Angelier's Graff,</HI> in the House of my Father; and some Time after in the <HI>English Alley</HI> abovesaid, and also without the Town, near the River <HI>Amstel,</HI> in <HI>Kuy∣pers Padt,</HI> or <HI>Cooper's-Lane;</HI> from whence the Meeting was removed in the Forepart of this Year (if my Memory doth not deceive me) into the <HI>Verwers Padt,</HI> or <HI>Dyers-Lane,</HI> which was then without the City-Free∣dom, and the Meeting-place was in a large Garret of a Tanner's House, where oftentimes came abundance of People, and among these, not a few of the rude Rabble. Here the Meeting was continu'd till the Year 1663, when that Place came into the Possession of another Owner.</P>

Ames</HI> at the Court of the <HI>Elector Palatine.</HI> Is kindly treated by the <HI>Elector.</HI></NOTE> after some Stay in <HI>Holland,</HI> return'd again to <HI>England.</HI> I think it was in this Year that <HI>William Ames</HI> went into <HI>Germany,</HI> where being come into the Palatinate, he went to <HI>Heidelburgh,</HI> and came to the Court of the Prince Elector, <HI>Charles Lod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wick,</HI> who treated him kindly, even at his own Table, and seemed not to take Offence at <HI>Ames</HI>'s Hat, which he kept on, tho' the Lords and others that were in the Company, stood bare-headed. The Baron of <HI>Helmont,</HI> who also was at that Court, was wont to tell afterwards, That <HI>Ames</HI> walking once with his Hat on, next to the Prince in his Garden, the Courtiers ask'd the Prince, Whether they should question <HI>Ames</HI> for this Incivility: But the Prince said, <HI>No, for I did expect that.</HI> At another Time the Prince made his Chaplain and <HI>Ames</HI> both dine with him, on Purpose, as it seems, that <HI>Ames,</HI> whom he knew to be a bold Man, might find Oc∣casion to reprove his Chaplain; for at Meat he suffered his Jester to come, who playing his Tricks, the Chaplain was silent: But <HI>Ames,</HI> who loved Gravity, and was averse to Jesting, took Occasion from thence to reprove such vain Actions; but chiefly he aimed at the Chaplain, whom because of his Silence at the lewd Behaviour of the Jester, he called, <HI>A dumb Dog;</HI> which seemed to please the Prince.</P>
<P>Now whilst <HI>William Ames</HI> was in the Palatinate, he got Acquaintance with the <HI>Baptists</HI> at <HI>Kriesheim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Krie∣sheim, Bap∣tists</HI> receive his Doctrine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d after set∣tle in <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI> be∣fore the Wars.</NOTE> a Town not far from <HI>Worms;</HI> and among those People he found such Entrance, that some Families receiving the Doctrine he preached, bore a publick Testimony for it there, and so continued till the Settlement of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> when they unanimously went thither, not as it seemed, without a singular Direction of Providence; for not long after, a War ensued in <HI>Germany,</HI> where the Palatinate was altogether laid waste by the <HI>French,</HI> and thousands of People were bereft of their Possessions, and reduced to Poverty.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Ames,</HI> when some in the Palatinate began to give an Ear to his Preaching, a Fine was settled against those that gave him Entertainment:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is favor'd by the <HI>Elector</HI> and his Sister.</NOTE> But the Prince Elector being informed hereof, took off that Fine; and tho' those of the Consistory did send for <HI>Ames,</HI> the Prince generously order'd them not to meddle with him. The Prince's Sister also behaved her self very kindly towards him, and received his Exhortations favourably.</P>
<P>A Year after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ames</HI> with <HI>J. Higgins</HI> again kindly received by the <HI>Elector.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ames</HI> came again into the Palatinate, with <HI>John Hig∣gins,</HI> and visiting the Prince Elector, he understood from the Captain of the Prince's Guard, that the Prince was glad of <HI>Ames</HI>'s Return thither. A while after, <HI>Higgins</HI> delivered to the Prince Elector a Book of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> with a Letter of <HI>Ames</HI> to the said Prince, who was so well pleas'd with it, that he bad <HI>Higgins</HI> to thank <HI>Ames</HI> on his Behalf, saying also that he took the Coming of <HI>Ames</HI> and <HI>Higgins</HI> to him and his Family very kindly, and really believed that what they spoke, was in Love to their Souls.</P>
<P>Several Years after this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And their Friends from <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> some others of <HI>Ames</HI>'s Friends from <HI>Eng∣land</HI> visited rhe aforesaid Prince Elector, and he always (to his Praise be it said) received them kindly. <HI>W.

Ames</HI> being at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> was confined there in <HI>Bedlam;</HI> which having made a great Noise, I'll give a brief Relation of it here. At <HI>Moordrecht,</HI> a Village near <HI>Gouda,</HI> liv'd at that Time one <HI>Martin Martinson,</HI> a Cooper by Trade; this Man approving the Doctrine preach'd by <HI>Ames</HI> at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and elsewhere,
<PB N="199" REF="003104_0210_0FEFF52AB46C0370"/>
began to assert it as Truth; and seeing now and then he with some of his sober Neighbours, kept a Meeting at his House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occasion thereof.</NOTE> this caused a great Stir in the Town, insomuch that sometimes he suffered rude Treatment from the People. <HI>Ames</HI> coming once there, and keeping a Meeting in <HI>Martin</HI>'s House, great Insolence was committed by the wicked Rabble. And going from thence to pass over the Water to <HI>Gouwerek,</HI> he was fol∣lowed by a Multitude of riotous People, both young and old, with a hi∣deous Cry of <HI>Quake, Quake, Quake!</HI> and was pelted with Stones and Clods, till he came to the Boat that carried him over. The Preacher of <HI>Gou∣werek</HI> hearing the Noise, came to the Boat, and ask'd, <HI>What the Matter was, why People made such a sad Noise?</HI> To which <HI>Ames</HI> answer'd, <HI>It seems the People are not taught better.</HI> To which the Preacher return'd, <HI>They are not used to make such ado against honest People; but I believe you to be a deceiving Wolf, that comes among the Sheep to seduce them, and that therefore they cry so. Prove this,</HI> reply'd <HI>Ames. I dont know you,</HI> said the Preach∣er. <HI>Learn then,</HI> return'd <HI>Ames, better Manners, than to call one thou know∣est not, a Wolf and a Deceiver.</HI> And so going his Way, shortly after he wrote from <HI>Rotterdam</HI> to <HI>Martin,</HI> and bad him go to the Preacher, and desire him to appoint a Time to prove <HI>that</HI> Ames <HI>was a deceiving Wolf.</HI> But to this, the Preacher shew'd himself backward; yet to be rid of <HI>Martin,</HI> he said at length, <HI>Come, I'll prove it presently.</HI> But <HI>Martin</HI> re∣ply'd, <HI>I am not come for that; but this must be done to</HI> Ames; and insist∣ing thereon, <HI>Well,</HI> said the Preacher, <HI>Let him come next</HI> Sunday <HI>before Noon, after Sermon; then I'll prove it publickly before all People.</HI></P>
<P>Of this <HI>Martin</HI> sent Word to <HI>Ames;</HI> but Things were managed so, that this Project of Proof was quash'd: For the Preacher of <HI>Gouwerek</HI> went to his Colleague at <HI>Moordrecht,</HI> and consulted with him what to do in the Case; and <HI>Ames</HI> being come to <HI>Moordrecht</HI> on the first Day of the Month called <HI>March,</HI> and the last of the Week, tho' it was late at Night, was seen and known by some, who committed much Vio∣lence upon the House of <HI>Martin,</HI> where <HI>Ames</HI> was entered. The next Day it was reported that some of the Sheriff's Men of <HI>Gouda</HI> were come to <HI>Gouwerek,</HI> to apprehend <HI>Ames</HI> when he came there; and at <HI>Moordrecht,</HI> the Dikegrave's Men came to the same Purpose; and so they took <HI>Ames</HI> Prisoner, and carried him to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where he was lock'd up in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> as a Madman. And a Week after, <HI>Martin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">As is also <HI>M. Martinson.</HI></NOTE> for having kept Meetings at his House, where not above eight Persons were come to∣gether, was also by the Dikegrave's Men taken Prisoner in his House, and carried to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where he was lock'd up with <HI>Ames.</HI> Who were the Instigators of this Business is plain enough, tho' I don't men∣tion them.</P>
<P>After <HI>Ames</HI> had been not much above three Weeks in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> the Under-Governor of the House, on the 27th of the Month about Night, came to him and <HI>Martin,</HI> and said, <HI>If I was in your Place, I would go out.</HI> Which made <HI>Ames</HI> ask, <HI>Whether he would suffer them to do so?</HI> To which he answered, <HI>That he should not hinder them.</HI> Then <HI>Ames return'd, I won't be reputed as one that broke Prison.</HI> To which the Deputy reply'd, <HI>Nay, why should you be reputed so? You may go out freely; all is unlock'd, and the Door will stand open for you: For the Governors are not minded that you should stay here.</HI> Then <HI>Ames</HI> said, <HI>Well, I intend to go out to Morrow.</HI> The next Day <HI>Martin</HI>'s Wife came to see her Husband; but the Deputy told her, that he had an Order in Writing from the Dikegrave, that ra∣ther than to let <HI>Martin</HI>'s Wife come to him, he might let him and <HI>Ames</HI> go out together. The Issue was, that they were both let out that Morning, it being the 28th of the Month. But they staid at <HI>Rot∣terdam,</HI> intending not to depart the Town before they had given No∣tice to the Dikegrave of their being let out; lest any Qccasion might
<PB N="200" REF="003104_0211_0FEFD57CECA00E98"/>
be given for saying that they had broken Prison. And it was not with∣out Reason they were so cautious: For the next Day in the Morn∣ing, the Deputy came to them, and said, <HI>I desire that you won't bring me into Trouble; for I am am an ancient Man, and the</HI> Dikegrave <HI>hath been with me, and ask'd for you:</HI> To which I answer'd, <HI>That you were gone out; but he took this very ill. I desire therefore that you would say, that you were gone out without my Knowledge.</HI> But this was not to be expected from <HI>Ames,</HI> whom I knew so well, that I truly believe he would rather have died, than to have spoken a Lie: For in such a Case he was without Question, of the same Mind as formerly <HI>Christian Languedol,</HI> Uncle of my Grandmother by the Mother's Side, who when at <HI>Ant∣werp,</HI> he, with other Martyrs, was led to the Stake to be burnt, cry'd out immediately, and with a valiant Mind, <HI>If we would once but have told a Lye, we might have escaped this.</HI> But to return to <HI>Ames,</HI> he told the Deputy, <HI>That he himself intended to go and speak with the</HI> Dikegrave, <HI>and if he was displeased at their going out, he might put them in again where they had been; for they would not have the Name of Prison-breakers.</HI> Then they both went to the <HI>Dikegrave,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Dis∣course with the <HI>Dike∣grave.</HI></NOTE> and told him after what Manner they were come out; saying also, that they would not have it said, that they broke out. <HI>That Name,</HI> said the Dikegrave, <HI>you would have had, if you had departed the Town; for the Deputy hath told me that you got out by breaking a Window.</HI> After some other Words were exchanged, he further said, <HI>I have nothing to object against your Life and Conversation, having heard no∣thing concerning you but a good Report; neither do I seek to persecute you. But would you be willing to return to</HI> Bedlam? <HI>Ames</HI> answer'd, <HI>Here we stand before thee, thou may'st do with us according to thy Pleasure. And if thou desirest us to return thither, we'll do so;</HI> The Dikegrave signifying, <HI>that this was his Desire,</HI> said, <HI>that they might go and walk in the Gallery then, till another Order came.</HI> And so he caused his Messenger to go along with them. Being come thither, they not long retained the Liberty to walk in the Gallery, but on the 31st of the Month they were lock'd up again, each in a Hole by himself. Now <HI>Ames</HI> acquainted the Deputy that he heard from the Dikegrave, <HI>that he had been informed by him, that they were got out by breaking a Window.</HI> But the Deputy denied to have said so. They were detained there yet some Time, and were pretty much visited, and this often by such as sought nothing but to scoff at them; and among these, a certain Clergyman did not stick to say to <HI>Ames, That he was a Deceiver, because he wore Pewter Buttons, to make People believe they were Silver ones.</HI> Whilst <HI>Ames</HI> was confined here, he wrote some Papers, which afterwards he gave out in Print, and among these, a Reply to an Answer of one <HI>Jacob Koelman,</HI> to 83 Queries given forth by the said <HI>Ames;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are set at Li∣berty.</NOTE> who now being set at Liberty, travell'd to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermany,</HI> as hath been said before, and from thence going back to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> native Country, after some Time he returned again into <HI>Holland.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did also <HI>William Caton.</HI></P>
<P>But now I turn again to <HI>England,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Account was published in Print of the Sufferings of the Peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>led <HI>Quakers,</HI> which being of∣fer'd to the Parliament, was deliv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Speaker, <HI>Thomas Bampfield.</HI> This contain'd a Relation of above one hundred and forty Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of Friends Suf∣ferings offer'd to the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> all distinguished by their Names, who for the keeping of Meetings, the refusing to swear, the not putting off their Hats, the not paying of Tithes, and their travelling up and down the Country, had been taken up and imprisoned, and many also been deprived of their Goods, and one and twenty of these died either by Sickness in Prison, or by violent Abuses; among whom was <HI>Richard Sale,</HI> near <HI>West-chester,</HI> who being Constable, had a Minister of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> brought to him, with a Pass as a Vagabond, whose Conversation so convinc'd the Con∣stable, that he gave him his Pass and Liberty. And because the said
<PB N="201" REF="003104_0212_0FEFF52D706144E8"/>
<HI>Sale</HI> judged both Priests and People to be exceedingly darken'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Sale</HI> a Constable used barbarously at <HI>West-chester.</HI></NOTE> he en∣tred upon an extraordinary Act, to shew them by a Sign that they wanted to be enlightned, <HI>viz.</HI> he came in the Day-time with a Lant∣horn and burning Candle into the Steeple-house during the Sermon. But this was resented to such a high Degree, that by Order of the Mayor he was put into Prison, and thrust into a Hole call'd <HI>Little-Ease,</HI> which was so strait, that it could not well receive his Body; but he was thrust in with such Violence, that his Body was bruised, and he spit Blood, and shortly after grew sick, and his Body swelling, occasi∣oned by the squeezing of it into the Hole, he died in great Pain. In the before-mentioned Account it was also said, that in the last six Years about two thousand Persons, for being <HI>Quakers,</HI> had suffered in their Body and Goods. To this was added a Paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mutual christion Love amongst Friends.</NOTE> signed by more than one hundred and sixty Persons, (several of whom I knew) whereby they offer'd to the Parliament to put themselves in the Stead of their Bre∣thren, who were confined either in Prisons, or Houses of Correction, or in Dungeons, some being fetter'd, and others lying sick only on a little Straw; wherefore they declared themselves ready to change Pla∣ces with them, out of true Love, that so they might go out, and not die by Hardship, as many had done already, to prevent which they were willing to take upon themselves the Sufferings of their Brethren, and lay down their Lives for them. Under their Names they added, <HI>If we had been of</HI> Esau<HI>'s Race, we should have fainted before this Time; and if we had been of</HI> Cain<HI>'s Progeny, we should have fought with his Weapons; but this never was, neither is it the Way of the Righteous and Chosen, of which we are from the Foundation of the World.</HI> It was in the Month called <HI>April,</HI> that this Paper was deliver'd to the Parliament; but I don't find that this Offer was accepted, or any Thing done for releasing the imprisoned.</P>
<P>About this Time also <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI> published a Paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka∣ble Prophecy of <HI>Edw. Bur∣roughs.</HI></NOTE> containing a very remarkable Prediction of what followed the next Year, when King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second was placed on the Throne. In it he saith, that as he was travelling in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> in the first Month, his Meditati∣ons being upon the Lord; and considering what unjust and woful Suf∣ferings had been inflicted upon the Lord's People within these few Years, a Cry went thro' him, <HI>The Lord will be avenged, the Lord will be avenged, upon his Enemies, and he will avenge the Cause of his People.</HI> This Cry stuck close upon him, and his Heart was even broken therewith, and his Spirit melted before the Lord, it being, as it were, said to him, <HI>Write unto the Rulers and yet once more warn them of that Recompence, and of that Indig∣nation, which is at Hand upon them, even a just Recompence for all their Deeds; and as they have done, even so shall it be done to them; as they have sought to destroy the Generation of the Righteous, even so shall they be destroyed from off the Face of the Earth; and as they have unjustly judged and condemned the In∣nocent, so shall they be condemned, and justly judged of the Lord; and as they have cast the Bodies of the poor Lambs of Christ into Prison, and been a Snare upon them, even so shall they be ensnared, and into Captivity shall they go. And as they have caused the Goods and Possessions of the Innocent to be spoiled, and made a Prey, even so in like Manner shall the Curse of the Lord spoil their Sub∣stance. And as they have done, so shall it be done unto them; and as they have met to others, so shall it be met to them again. And I saw a great Misery and Desolation nigh at Hand, even the Sword of the Lord; and that it should slay them; and I beheld it was made ready for the Slaughter; and in the Sense of these Things, a Sadness fell upon my Spirit, considering the Desolation and the Judgment that is at hand, to be executed upon the cruel Oppressors.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Wherefore all ye Rulers, and all ye that have trodden down the Heritage of God, and ye that have disregarded those many Warnings that ye have had; I say unto you all, in the Power of the Lord God,
<PB N="202" REF="003104_0213_0FEFD57F02C0AA88"/>
in his Dominion, and by his Spirit; this is once more a Warning to you from the Lord, and that these Things must surely come to pass, and be fulfilled in their Season, and no Man shall be able to deliver his Brother; but every Man shall bear his own Burthen, and drink his own Cup, prepared for him; and tho' it hath been counted a light Thing among you, and you have despised the Reproof, and gone on without Fear; yet in as much as the Lord hath spared you, and not speedily executed Judgment upon you, but rather waited for your Return; yet the Dealing of the Lord towards you, in sparing of you, you have not accepted; and therefore shall his Judgments be the greater upon you, For if you do now come to the Witness in your own Consciences, What Evil have this People done? Whose Ox have they taken, or what have they desired of you? Or what have they sought from you? Or wherein have they been a Burthen to you? Saving that they have reproved you for your Iniquities, and desired your Redemption? Would you but now at last come to con∣sider this, and confess the Truth in your Consciences; will not that tell you, that they have patiently suffered all Things that you have cruelly imposed upon them? And have not they walked peaceably to∣wards you, and humbly, meekly and justly among their Neighbours? And have they not been meek and innocent, even as Lambs, and as Sheep before the Shearers? and have they wrought Offences towards any? Have they sought the Overthrow of the Government, or have they sought Vengeance against their Enemies? Or what Injury have they done to any Man's Person or Estate, saving to Satan and his Kingdom? Have they not sought to reform and reclaim the Ungodly from their Ways? And have they not pitied and prayed for their E∣nemies? And have they not in all Things walked in good Conscience towards the Lord, and towards all Men? Yea, my Friends, in the Day of the Lord, when the Witness in your Consciences shall not be limited, but shall speak plainly, and when the impartial Judge shall appear upon his Throne, then shall you acknowledge these Things.
Wherefore I say unto you, receive the Judgment of the Lord, to purify you, otherwise the Judgment shall destroy you; and now come to be more wise, that some of you may be as a Brand pluck'd out of the Fire, and be reserved from being consumed; for the Visitation of the Lord is near an End, when his loving Kindness will be shut from you, and his Long-suffering turned into Fury; and he will make you know that we are his People, with whom you have thus dealt; yea, you shall suddenly know it; the Time is not long till he will crown his People in the Sight of his Enemies; he will crown them with Praise and with Righteousness, with Honour and Majesty, and he will keep them in Safety, even when Sorrow compasses you a∣bout; his Mercy and loving Kindness shall extend towards them, e∣ven when his Wrath and Judgments doth smite you, and confound you. O! what shall I say unto you; for the deep Sense thereof re∣mains upon my Heart; for when I consider, how that in all Ages the Lord did avenge his People's Cause, and when the Time of their Suffering was expired, he broke the Bonds of Iniquity, and set them free. Thus did he with his People <HI>Israel</HI> of old, and many Times it was his Way with his People, to bring them low by Suffering, and then to raise them up again in Glory; and he suffered their Ene∣mies for a Season to glory over them, that he might bring them down. And thus he did in <HI>England,</HI> in the Case between the Bishops and their Crew of Persecutors, and the poor People at that Day called <HI>Puritans:</HI> Did not he confound that persecuting Crew, and deliver his People? And is not he the same to effect the same Work at this very Day?
<PB N="203" REF="003104_0214_0FEFF52FA3D58DB0"/>
Yea, doubtless, and much more will he do, inasmuch as the Mani∣festation of Truth is more clear than it was in their Days; and in as much as the Rulers and People of this Nation have rejected a more clear Testimony, than either the <HI>Papists</HI> in Quoen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, or the Bishops and Prelates in their Days; even so much the more will the Lord execute his Vengeance with more Violence, in a more manifest Way; and all shall know, that it is he that doth it, and he will set his People free; for he hath regarded their Sufferings, and he hath said, it is enough; for he hath tried them, and found them faithful; and all this hath been suffered to prove them, and not to destroy them: And like as he hath preserved them in Patience and Peace thro' it all, even so will he give them Hearts to walk answerably to their Delive∣rance; and us they have abounded in Patience in their Suffering, so shall they abound in Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e everlasting in the Day of their Freedom, and the Earth shall be glad, and shall yield the Increase and Blessing; the Hea∣ven and Earth shall rejoice, and the Hearts of the Righteous shall leap for Joy, when the Lord hath broken the Yoke of the oppressed, and set his People free, inwardly and outwardly; and then shall they sing to the Lord over all their Enemies, who shall be tormented and vexed in the Lord's sore Displeasure; for their Reward cometh, and their Recompence shall be even as their Work, and he will give un∣to them Sorrow and Anguish, instead of Rejoicing.
But again when I considered the long Suffering, and Patience, and Forbearance of the Lord's innocent People under all their Sufferings; and when I looked at their Innocency, and at their Righteousness, and Spirit of Holiness with which the Lord had blessed them, my Heart was made glad in the Consideration of this; and the more was my Joy, the more I beheld their Innocency, and the Guiltlesness of their Cause, whereby the Unjustness of their Suffering did the more appear; and withal, when I looked and beheld their Increase under all their Sufferings, and how that the Lord had turned all these Things to their Good, and to the Overthrow of all their Enemies; how that by that Way, wherein their Enemies intended to destroy them from being a People, even thereby did the Lord most wonderfully increase them to be a great People; for thro' all have they grown in Life and Power, and in Strength, and in Number, and thro' it all have they been encouraged to follow the Lord with more Zeal and Boldness. Add in the Consideration of this I did rejoice, with magnifying the Lord for ever, that he had brought forth his Praise, even thro' the Wickedness of the Wicked, and he had increased his People, and exalted them thro' the Cruelty of all their Enemies; and that thro' all Opposition they were attain'd unto a happy Rest, and thro' all the Tempest of great Trials, they were arrived into the Harbour of Renown and great Glory: And wher I consider this, how that the Lord had given them Dominion, and brought their Life to reign over all their Enemies, these Things were a Joy unto me; and looking back into Ages, seeing there was nothing, nor any People for Generations, that had grown, and risen thro' all Opposi∣tion like unto these, wherefore it is a Sign and a Testimony that we are the Lord's, and that these Things are of him, and from him, and by him alone, that he might be praised for ever.
Again, when I do consider, how that the Lord hath raised his People, even out of the Dust; and them that were not a People, are become a People; and the Lord hath provoked Nations by them that were not a People within these few Years; and the Lord hath carried on this Work among his People, not by any Thing of Man, nor by the Arm of Flesh, but in pure Innoceney and Simplicity hath
<PB N="204" REF="003104_0215_0FEFF4F22C4511A0"/>
it been accomplished; not by the Wisdom of this World, nor by Men in Places of Honour, and of Power in the Nations; for all that has been wanting to them, and what they are, it is thro' the Oppo∣sition of all this; for they have had none of the great Men of the Earth on their Side to defend them, and establish them, but all have been against them, and even Oppression and Tyranny executed upon them, rather than any Approbation, or Justification from Men in outward Authority: So that truly it may be said, there hath been nothing of Man in this Work, but all of the Lord, by his own Pow∣er, and in a contrary Way to all the false Sects, and false Churches, hath the Beginning and carrying on of these Things been; for we know that all the false Sects in this Nation have risen, and been esta∣blished thro' the Countenance of Men in Place and Power, and upon Man, and the Wisdom of this World, and Authority of the Powers of the Earth, hath the Rise and Fall of all false Churches depended: And as the Powers of the Earth have sided with them, so have they been set up; and at the Displeasure of Authority, have been cast down. But as for this People, they are raised of the Lord, and established by him, even contrary to all Men; and they have given their Pow∣er only to God, and they cannot give their Power to any mortal Men, to stand or fall by any outward Authority, and to that they cannot seek; but to the Lord alone, who heareth their Cry, and will avenge their Cause.
Wherefore let all the Persecutors bow before the Lord, and let all the Saints walk humbly in his Sight, and let them continue in that innocent Life in which they have begun; and let them never forget the Mercies of the Lord, and what he hath brought to pass, who hath manifested great Things, and will do more and more to the con∣founding of all his Enemies, and to the Praise of his elect People. And all ye Saints upon the Earth, have ye the Lord in Respect continually, and turn you not unto Idols, but let the Lord be your Joy for evermore.</P>

<P>Not long after the publishing of this Paper, <HI>to wit,</HI> in the Month called <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Bur∣roughs <HI>and</HI> S.

and try them; and that he would hew down their idolatrous Ways, Worships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writes Que∣ries to the Friars and Nuns.</NOTE> and Works.</HI> The next Day <HI>Burroughs</HI> wrote some Queries to the Friars and Nuns in and about that Town, which were sent to them in <HI>Latin.</HI> The Introduction was thus:</P>
<P><HI>The mighty Day of the Lord is come and coming upon you, and all the World: Awake, awake, ye that sleep in the Earth, for the dreadful God is arising to plead with you, and to give unto all the World the Cup of his fierce Indig∣nation, because of your Idolatries, and Hypocrisies, and Abominations, which have corrupted the Earth, and are come up before him, and have provoked him; and the Cry of the Just, who hath been smitten and laid slain, is entred into the Ears of the Most High, and his Sword, which is the Word of his Mouth, is awakened to wound and slay all his Enemies. And the Day of your Visita∣tion is now come, wherein the Lord is searching you, and trying you, that he may recompence you: And this is the Word of the Lord to you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wherefore I am moved of the Lord to propound some few</HI> Queries <HI>to you, for the Trial of your Spirits and Ways; to which I demand your Answer, that all Things may be brought to Light and true Judgment, and that you may be judged justly, and by the Spirit of the Lord cleared, or condemned, according to your Deeds.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Queries</HI> were partly concerning the Orders of Friars and Nuns, whether any such were in the Church in the Apostles Days; and concern∣ing the Popish Worship and Ceremonies, demanding Proof of their Law∣fulness from the holy Scriptures. After the delivering of these <HI>Queries</HI> to the <HI>Capuchins, Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Fisher</HI> went also to the Friars of other Orders, and entred into Discourse with them: But their plain Speeches against their Idolatrous Rites and Ceremonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discourse with those of other Orders.</NOTE> found no Entrance. After some Stay in the Town, they going to the College of the Jesuits, got into Discourse with their chief Rector; and after a Conference of about three Hours, he grew weary, and pretending other Business,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And with the chief Rec∣tor of the Je∣suits.</NOTE> would stay no longer with them; and so they parted, asking him, <HI>Whether he would ad∣mit more Discourse at some other Time?</HI> But he refused it. <HI>Burroughs</HI> after∣wards wrote a Letter to him, which began thus:</P>

<P>But neither this <HI>Query,</HI> nor the others were answered. <HI>Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Fisher</HI> did also visit the Nuns; and speaking to them thro' a Grate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor this, nor others answe∣red.</NOTE> they asked, <HI>If they were of the Order of those called</HI> Quakers; and soon perceiv∣ing they were such, they said, <HI>They might not hear them,</HI> and so presently passed away; whereby <HI>Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Fisher</HI> were deprived of an Opportu∣nity to speak to them; only they witnessed against them. <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> wrote also some Propositions to the Jesuits, Priests, and Friars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propositions in <HI>Latin</HI> sent to the Jesuits.</NOTE> where∣in he particularly represented the Tyranny of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in true Colours; and these Propositions were sent to them in <HI>Latin.</HI> They stand yet some few Days in Town, and had divers Meetings among the <HI>English</HI> Soldiers: And <HI>Burroughs</HI> also wrote to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Have Meet∣ings among the <HI>English</HI> Soldiers.</NOTE> and bid them <HI>to be faithful to the Lord, and not to seek themselves in their Service, but the Honour of God:</HI> He also shewed them what their Duty was in their military Station; and not to give them too rough a Brush,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> writes to them</NOTE> but to meet them somewhat in their own Way; following therein the Example of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> when he spoke to the Soldiers, <HI>Luke</HI> iii. 14. told them, <HI>What do you know but the Lord may have some good Work for you

to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Advice to Soldiers and Officers.</NOTE> if you be faithful to him?</HI> And he also signified unto them, <Q>That since the Lord one Day would avenge the innocent Blood shed in the Pope's Dominions, and appear against <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> the Seat of the Whore, and the Kingdom of Antichrist, it seem'd not improbable to him, that the Lord would make Way thereto by the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</Q> <HI>It is,</HI> said he <HI>the Lord's Work, I know, to make Men truly religious; but yet he may work by you to break down the Bryars and Thorns, and the Rocks and Hills that have set themselves against the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. He also advised them, if ever such a Work fell to be their Lot, <HI>not to be ambitious nor vain-glorious; but to make it their Work to demand the Disannulling of the Popish Inquisition and cruel Laws.</HI> And the Officers he charged, <HI>not to be as Tyrants and Oppressors over the poor Soldiers, but to be loving and meek, and Examples of all Goodness unto them:</HI> To this he added, <HI>And having no Sin lying upon your Consciences, then ye shall face your Enemies with Courage, and not fear Death, but shall be ready to lay down your Lives in a good Cause.</HI> But left any might think he was for the Bearing of Arms, and not for Harmlesness or Non-resistance, he told them also, <HI>That the Lord had a more honourable Work to work after them,</HI> viz. <HI>to destroy the Kingdom of the Devil, and the Ground of Wars.</HI> And <HI>that there was a more honourable Victory to be waited for,</HI> to wit, <HI>the Victory over Sin,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Burroughs</HI> and <HI>Fisher</HI> being once sent for by the Governor <HI>Lockhart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beth sent for by Governor <HI>Lockhart</HI></NOTE> found many Officers with him; and after some friendly Discourse, they advised them to Moderation, and the Fear of God, and so parted from them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return to <HI>England</HI></NOTE> And after having performed their Service in the Town, they re∣turned to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>Burroughs</HI> gave the foresaid Queries out in Print, and wrote also a Paper to the Parliament, exhorting those that were Mem∣bers of that Assembly, to fear God, and not to oppress honest People, but to free them from Oppression and Tyranny; <HI>lest the Lord come sud∣denly upon them, and break them to Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>The Power of the Protector <HI>Richard Cromwel</HI> already declining,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of State</NOTE> he was prevailed upon by the Officers of the Army to dissolve this Par∣liament, which began to make Enquiry how the Subsidies were em∣ploy'd: And by the Direction of some of the chief Republicans, the Long Parliament was called again. This Parliament set up a <HI>Com∣mittee of Safety,</HI> for apprehending those that disturbed the Peace, and for making an Alteration among the military Officers, either by ca∣sheering them, or otherwise; and encreasing in Power, erected also a <HI>Council of State;</HI> and Word was sent to <HI>Richard Cromwel,</HI> who was now deprived of all Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Cromwel <HI>removes from</HI> Whitehall.</NOTE> to remove from <HI>Whitehall;</HI> which at length he did, the Parliament allowing him two thousand Pounds for the Char∣ges of Removing, and promising to pay his Debts contracted for the Publick: And his Brother <HI>Henry,</HI> who was Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> was called back by the Parliament. Thus these two Brothers were again reduced to the state of private Men.</P>
<P><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> now wrote a Letter to the Parliament, and seriously ex∣horted them therein, <Q>To desist from all Persecution for Religion, and to take away that which gave Occasion thereunto.</Q> About this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Booth</HI>'s In∣surrection.</NOTE> there was an Insurrection in <HI>Cheshire</HI> for King <HI>Charles,</HI> under Sir <HI>George Booth;</HI> who having received a Commission from that Prince, got such Numbers of Followers, that he seized the City of <HI>Chester.</HI> In the mean while the Parliament sent <HI>Edmond Ludlow</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be Command∣er in chief of the Army there, instead of <HI>Henry Cromwel;</HI> and General <HI>Lambert</HI> was sent with an Army against <HI>Booth.</HI> Now since some rash Peo∣ple that went under the Name of <HI>Quakers,</HI> were for taking up Arms under <HI>Lambert;</HI> and that the Committee of Safety offered great Places and Commands to some of that Persuasion, thereby to draw them off
<PB N="207" REF="003104_0218_0FEFF534309D7710"/>
from the Truth they professed, <HI>G. Fox</HI> wrote a Paper, wherein he shewed <Q>The Unlawfulness of Wars and Fightings, representing it as a Work not at all becoming the Followers of Christ:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G Fox</HI> writes a Paper of the Unlawfulness of Wars.</NOTE> And he ex∣horted his Friends not to join with those that took up Arms, but to fight only with Spiritual Weapons, which took away the Occa∣sion of the Carnal.</Q> This he also recommended in his Preaching, for an harmless and innossensive Life was that which he always assert∣ed and practised.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Booth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Booth</HI> is de feated, taken, and sent to the Tower.</NOTE> he was defeated, and endeavouring to make his Escape in Woman's Clothes, was discovered in an Inn, and taken into Custody; and being carried to <HI>London,</HI> by an Order of the Parliament, he was committed to the <HI>Tower.</HI> The Officers of the Army, of which <HI>George Fleetwood</HI> was now Commander in chief, were very busy to get the up∣perhand of the Parliament; which caused great Division and Di∣straction in the Nation; for it was well known, that if the supreme Power was offer'd up to the Army, they then could do what they would; and thus the Nation would be governed by the Sword. It was also fresh in Memory, that it was the Army by which <HI>Cromwel</HI> had been advanced so as to become Protector, and supreme Ruler of the Nation: And therefore many opposed the Design on foot.</P>
<P>About this Time, also the Military Officers moved the Taking off of the Burthen of Tithes, and to settle another Maintenance for the National Preachers. But being unwilling that the Parliament should be Masters of the Army, they complained of having been deceived by the Parliament; and Colonel <HI>Desborough</HI> said, <Q>That they had not per∣formed any part of the Promises they had made to the Army; that they had taken no Care to secure a Liberty to tender Consciences; and that their Intention was to remove the principal Officers, and place others in their Commands, who were of different Principles.</Q></P>
<P>Now the Council of Officers was for calling a new Parliament; but this met with no small Opposition. In this Bustle the Council of Of∣ficers began to insinuate with the Clergy, and they agreed with them, That their Maintenance by Tithes should not be taken away till ano∣ther Revenue as ample and certain should be settled upon them: That some Provision should be made for those who differed in Faith and Worship from the established Church; but that the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and some others, whose Principles they said tended to the Destruction of civil Society, should not be tolerated at all. In this distracted State of Affairs, when some were for, and others against the Parliament, so that it was hardly well known in whom the supreme Authority resi∣ded, <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI> writ and published in Print a large Speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E.

<P>MY Master is a high, and mighty, and powerful Prince, and very honourable; and Fear, Reverence, Respect, and Sub∣jection belongs to him alone, from you and all Mankind; he is wise, and understanding, and of great Strength, and his Dominion is from everlasting to everlasting, and he can do whatsoever he will in Hea∣ven

and Earth, for he rules with his Iron Rod over the World, and whatsoever he saith, it is done: for his Word is an everlasting Com∣mand: If he saith to a Man, <HI>Live,</HI> it is so; if he saith to a Man, <HI>Die,</HI> it cometh to pass; and if he give Peace to a Man or a Nation, none can make War; and if he make War with a Person, or in a Nation, no Man is able to make Peace: For why? He hath all Power in his Hand, and to him all Judgment and Authority is given; he is the Son of the living God, the everlasting Creator; he was, and is, and is to come; his Eye beholdeth all Things, and his Arm com∣passeth Heaven and Earth; and what his Purpose is, he hath always, and will ever bring it to pass: If he set up Rulers, they must rule; and if he pull them down, none can hinder: Whom he will, he ho∣noureth; and if it be his Pleasure, he bringeth Men to Shame: If he break a Nation down, none can build it up; and if he confound Powers and Authorities in the Kingdoms of Men, they all fall as withered Grass before him. Behold ye Men! He is so great and mighty, and of so great Authority, that whatsoever he saith, it is done; and whatsoever he willeth, it cometh to pass, and none is able to resist him, and over∣come his Power, when his Pleasure is to accomplish a Work: By him all Things are that be, and all Things live that have Life, and thro' him all Things move, and of his Fulness every Creature in Heaven and Earth receive. And this, my Master, is altogether honourable in Birth, and otherwise, and altogether mighty in all his Works; he is just and merciful, full of Goodness, Righteousness, and Truth; all Virtue dwells in him, and his Judgment and Mercy, his Authority and Meekness, and his Wrath and his Love, they are Com∣panions; and what are ye before him? Or how shall ye be able to resist him, or to turn backward what his Purpose is concerning you, and this Nation? For ye have no Being nor Breath without him. Behold ye Men! ye are verily as the Dust before the Wind, so are ye to him, soon blown away, and your Place not found; as the Grass before the Mower, so are ye before him, soon cut down, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hered, and your Beauty utterly extinguished; as a Potter's Vessel under an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Rod, even so are you to him, he can immediately bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you, never to be bound up; as a Drop to the Fountain, so are you to him, soon dried up; and made nothing: Wherefore ye Men, ye mortal Crea∣tures, ye ignorant Persons, Sons of a Transgressor, ye Dust and Ashes, for thus you are in Comparison of him, this mighty Prince, hearken to his Message, which cometh to you from him; hear and fear, and be not stout Hearted against the Lord God, that is about to speak unto you.
As for this little Island of <HI>England,</HI> wherein your present Place and Being is, it is an Island which the Lord hath shewed great Favour unto in Ages past, and in this present Time; and I must tell you, he hath a Purpose of Love towards it, and to honour it in the View of the World, tho' thro' great Tribulations; and he hath an Intent of great Good unto it; for he hath a Seed, a precious Seed in it, scattered abroad, and he hath a People that fear his Name, and have walked in his Ways, and he hath made them, and elected them, and what they are, it is by him; that he may dwell among them, and have the whole Government over them all; yea, he hath a speedy Purpose verily concerning this Nation, and he will purify it in Judgment, and refine its Inhabitants thro' the Fire of Tribulations, that it may be pleasant to him, and fit to do his Will: He hath a Purpose to work some great Thing in it, I must tell you, as he hath said unto me so to do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he will have his Name exalted and reverenced in this Island, and his Terror shall be sent out of it thro' the World, and his Branch

from it shall spread over the Earth; he doth purpose in his Season, to take it into his own Hand, and to sway the Government thereof with his own Scepter, and to set up Righteousness alone, and to overthrow all Oppressors and Oppressions; and the Kingdoms of this World must become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ.
True it is, such hath been the coming to pass of Time, and of Things, for many Ages by-past, that my Master hath been, as it were, banished from the Nation, and hath not been suffered to enjoy his Right, but hath been expelled, even, as it were, by the Force of Satan and Antichrist, who hath long usurp'd Authority over the In∣habitants of this Nation; and in my Master's Absence lamentable In∣justice, Cruelty, Unmercifulness, Tyranny and Oppression hath been exercised upon the Inhabitants, and the poor Creatures have been held in great Slavery by their Rulers, that have ruled by the Dra∣gon's Power, and been kept in great Blindness and Ignorance, and un∣der great Oppression both in Body and Spirit, by antichristian Tea∣chers, for this many Years, even while the great King hath been ab∣sent, and as it were gone into a far Country; even all this Time hath Antichrist and the Devil ruled and reigned, and have made and exe∣cuted Oppression and tyrannical Laws and Decrees, both in Church and State; and all the Nation hath been out of right Order, and laid waste and barren of good Fruit, and it hath been as a Wilderness by reason hereof; and Men that have ruled for many Years, have not ruled singly by my Master's Authority, but by another Power, tho' not without the Knowledge of my Lord, neither as tho' he had not Power to have done otherwise; but for his own Pleasure he hath suffered it thus to be, and let Men go on to rule and govern in their own Wills, and after their own Lusts; and People have walked wickedly towards him, and towards one another; and all this he hath suffered, not as if he gave Toleration for it; for his Messengers now and then, and his Witness in Peoples Consciences, have been reproving their un∣godly Ways, and he hath often shewed his Dislike by divers Ways and Tokens, and many Judgments, and strange Overturning, to the Way and Proceeding of both Rulers, Prophets, and Teachers of this Nation; but yet they have gone on against his Mind, and contrary to his Will, notwithstanding his Reproofs and Judgments: Not that he had not Power to have executed his Pleasure in Wrath upon them, and to have destroy'd them altogether, and have made the Nation a Heap, and as nothing long before this Day; for Power was in his Hand to have done it; but he hath been long-susfering, and of great Patience, and born all Things, and taken the Injustice, and Cruelty, and Wickedness, and Idolatry, and all Unrighteousness that hath a∣bounded in the Nation, upon himself, and suffered under it, and born it for its Season, while woful and lamentable Oppressions have been practised in civil State, even hellish Laws, and devilish Executors of them; merciless Tyrants have born the Scepter, and reigned for many Years over the Inhabitants, and in Church and State has been heinous Idolatry and superstitious Vanities committed in a high Nature and Measure, and even all Men, and States of Men, and Orders of Men of every Degree have been abominably corrupted in the Sight of my Lord, even from the <HI>Prince</HI> to the <HI>Beggar,</HI> even Rulers and Subjects, Teachers and People, Judges and Prophets, they have been corrupted both in Heart and Hand, and they have dealt falsely and wickedly to∣wards him, and towards one another, even to the great Displeasure and Vexation of him, and his blessed Spirit, and to the high Provoca∣tion of him to their own Destruction, if his Long-suffering had not pre∣vailed;

and all this while he hath lain as it were asleep, and at rest in him∣self; and he hath left Men to try them, what they will do, and he hath given them a Day; many Kings and Rulers he hath let them have a little Time, to see how they would use it; but they have abused it, and not ruled for him, nor accomplished his Work, nor fulfilled his Will, but acted even in Defiance of him, and of his Pow∣er, and to his great Dishonour.
Alack! I must be plain with you: My Lord hath been utterly ex∣iled, and greatly dishonoured, and highly provoked and vexed, by reason of such Proceedings, as have been in this Nation for these ma∣ny Years, thro' the Corruption of all Sorts of Men in Place and Pow∣er, who have not ruled for him, but for the Devil, to their own corrupted Ends; only he hath suffered Men to go on in their Course for a Season; some as it were appearing on the Stage for a Time, and suddenly cast down again for their Iniquities Sake; and his Hand hath been in all these Things, tho' very privately and secretly, not known and discerned by the Sons of Men, yet hath he ruled over the Kingdoms of Men, and pulled down one, and set up another. And to forbear the several Actings and Proceedings of many by-passed Ages, and to come to this Generation, and to speak of Things that have happened within these few Years, and of the Changing and over∣turning that hath happened in this Nation; such was the Cruelty, Tyranny, Oppression and Idolatry, both in Church and Civil State, that the People of this Nation were held under, in the Days of <HI>Pa∣pal Power;</HI> such, I say, was the exceeding Height of the Cruelty and Tyranny of that Time, that not any that feared or reverenced my Lord, in any Measure, could scarce live, or have a Being in the Na∣tion; even against every Man that did but incline towards him, and desire the Knowledge of his Ways, Hell's Mouth was opened a∣gainst them, and they were swallowed up, and many of their Lives taken from the Earth, by the Hellish Power that had in that Day usurped Authority in this Island; and when thus it was, then he looked down from Heaven, and his Bowels of Compassion were open∣ed, for the Sake of the oppressed People that desired after him, in so much that he broke and threw down the Power of their Oppres∣sors in some Measure, as it stood in Papal Authority; and when the Iniquity of that Power was filled up, he took Vengeance upon it; and I must tell you, it was he that brought it about, even the De∣stroying of that Power in this Nation, and freeing the Nation from it, tho' the Men that were Instruments in the Cause were not his Ser∣vants, otherwise than as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> served him; for he hath a secret Way to have a Service from the Wicked, and such is his Pow∣er, that he can turn the Wickedness of the Wicked to his Glory, and he can make a Rod to whip his Adversaries, and burn it when he hath done, and he hath often destroyed one Wickedness by another. Well, but to leave that, tho' he did in some Measure free the Na∣tion from much Tyranny and Cruelty, in the casting out <HI>Popish</HI> Au∣thority; yet alack! the Nation in a few Years was near as much vio∣lated by Injustice and Cruelty, under the succeeding Power, as ever it was once under the Papal Power; tho' before there had been some small Reformation and Change in outward Appearance, tho' little in Ground and Nature; yet Oppression, and Idolatry, and Superstition in Church and State, and all Prophaneness and Wickedness among People was grown so high, like as it had been under the <HI>Papal Pow∣er</HI> before; and all that desired after the Lord, and were weary of Ini∣quity, and of the then present Oppressions and Idolatries, were per∣secuted, and slain, and destroyed, and Injustice and Cruelty exercised
<PB N="211" REF="003104_0222_0FEFF539A5DFD4D0"/>
upon them, even almost to the rooting out of Righteousness, and to the grieving of the Lord's Spirit: Well then, because of the Cry of the People, and the Oppression of the Nation under that Authority, my Lord looked down again, and even for his Name's Sake, and for his Seed's Sake, he had Compassion on this Nation, to set it free, and to break off its Oppressions; and in a great Measure he did de∣liver the People of this Nation in many Things, and there was a Part of Reformation wrought, and much pretended and looked for; and all this came to pass thro' him, and my Lord did accomplish it, however the Instruments by which he wrought proved deceitful, and became Oppressors, as others before them: and tho' there was in this Nation a Day of great Troubles, and Wars, and Contention, and great Strife, and the wasting of much Blood, and earthly Treasure; and none of these Things I must tell you, fell without the ordering of my Master's Hand; yet so it was, and came to pass, that after this Nation was restored to Peace, tho' much Unrighteousness and Injustice was removed, yet there was much also left behind; and Men that he had used as Instruments in his Hand, in a good Work, and to whom he had given Wisdom and Understanding, and appear∣ed in much Mercy and in great Deliverance; yet they even turned to seek themselves, and became corrupted in the Spoils of their Enemies, and when Peace and Plenty abounded, the Lord was forgotten again; and then the Land fell under Oppressors, and began again to cry out for Freedom, even when other Horns of the first Beast sprang up, and went on each of them after his Follow; and tho' one Horn has striven to break another, yet after <HI>one</HI> hath been cast down, <HI>another hath rison, and made an Image to the first,</HI> and ruled and reigned by the same Spirit and Authority, derived from the Dragon's Power in Cru∣elty and Oppression, and made Laws, and executed them to the Dis∣honour of the Lord, and to the great Oppression of his People, and to the filling of this Island with Injustice and Cruelty, even from one <HI>Generation to another,</HI> until this Day: And thus up and down have Times and Seasons been altered, Powers and Authority changed and altered, Statutes, Laws and Decrees, changeable and alterable; <HI>for as the Iniquity of one Power was; filled up, that was cast down, and another had its Day, till the Measure thereof was also filled up, that it might partake of the same Judgments.</HI> And in all these Overturnings, Breakings-down and Overthrowings, the <HI>very Hand of my Lord hath been,</HI> tho' secretly, and not discerned, yet his Power hath brought about, and suffered all these Things to come to pass and who shall charge him with Injustice? Or, who shall say, <HI>What hast thou done!</HI> Or, <HI>Why hast thou done it?</HI> For, as I have said, he is a high and mighty Prince, and can do whatsoever he will; and he is the supream Power mad Au∣thority, <HI>which rules and reigns in, and over all the Kingdoms of Men.</HI> And what tho' he hath used wicked Men <HI>as an Instrument</HI> to accomplish his Work, and made the Wicked his Rod, and even brought it to pass, <HI>that one Wickedness should destroy another, and one Oppressor break down another, and the Kingdom of Antichrist confound it self;</HI> yet what of all these Things? All Flesh must be silent before him, and all People, and the whole Earth must be subject unto him; for the Government and Dominion over Heaven and Earth is his, and all Power and Do∣minion belongeth to him alone, and all Judgment is in his Hand, to bring to pass whatsoever he will, and by whomsoever as he pleas∣eth.
But now, my Friends, tho' I would not be tedious to you, yet I must I tell you the Truth, and faithfully deliver the Lord's Mes∣sage unto you; and as concerning this last <HI>Overturning,</HI> there was
<PB N="212" REF="003104_0223_0FEFF4FC014ADB38"/>
something of the Hand of my Lord in it; and he can, and will bring forth his own Work and Praise by it, and it shall be for the Good of all his People, that wait upon him, tho' there was much <HI>Ambition and corrupted Ends in the Instruments,</HI> and neither Part were perfectly single to the Lord in their Proceedings; but their Work was tainted with the false idolatrous Spirit of Self-Seeking: Yet notwithstanding, the Lord may bring forth his Government, and his pleasant Plant, thro' and beyond all this, even out of another Root, which yet ap∣pears not among either ot them; and Righteousness may arise in the Nation, contrary to both of them, out of another Stem, and he will set up his Kingdom; and in the mean Time, <HI>leave one Potsherd of the Earth to break another.</HI>
And as for you, that now sit on the <HI>Throne,</HI> and bear Rule, whether <HI>Committee of Safety,</HI> (so called) chiefly, tho' it is not without my Ma∣ster; for he hath the Knowledge of it at least; yet you are not the only Men of his Choice, truly called of him to the Place of Govern∣ment, neither is your Government the Government of the Lamb; nei∣ther must it be for ever established by him; its <HI>Foundation is not bles∣sed, nor can its Building be prosperous:</HI> For why? Alas, it is but another Horn of that Fourth Beast, that hath been made to rule over the <HI>World,</HI> and upon the Earth for many Generations, and it is but hitherto a very little refined from the last, and is of the last, even as the Eighth was of the Seventh, spoken of by that Servant, <HI>Rev. xvii.</HI> 11. and it may also make War with the Lamb and his Followers for a little Season, and it may have a small Measure of Injustice and Perse∣cution to bring forth in the Land, even till the Words of God be ful∣filled, and his Kingdom be fully come; the Way of which is but yet preparing by all these Overturnings:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is meant here, chiefly, the new Commit∣tee of Safety (so called.)</NOTE> And this your present Govern∣ment originally is leavened with the Spirit of the Old Dragon, that hath killed the Saints, and drunk their Blood, and how should the Lord establish it? Nay, your Kingdom may prove but small and lit∣tle, and <HI>full of Ʋproars and Troubles, and little Peace, and Satisfaction and Establishment in it to your selves, nor the People under you; but Confusion will attend it, and Fears will compass it about:</HI> Tho' this I must tell you, as you are Men, You have your Day of Trial <HI>what you will do,</HI> as ma∣ny others have had before you; and something you may and ought to do, if but to make the Whore (the false Church) more naked, and to scourge her more than some others have done; and indeed my Lord requires something more of you (as such) to do, than others before you could do; and you have a Price put into your Hands, which you may improve to the Lord's Honour, and to the Nations Good, and to your own Happiness; which, if you be faithful to the Lord, to do what he requires of you, and if you become meek and humble Men, and fear his Name, and deny your selves, and not seek your own Honours, nor any Earthly Advantage to your selves; if you do thus, then my Lord will shew Mercy to you, and you shall not suddenly fall before your Enemies, tho' many may rise up against you; but your Days shall be lengthened, and the Purpose of the Lord may be turned to your longer Continuance, and not to your sudden Destruction; and if you walk in this Way, and rule only for the Lord, then shall you be honoured as Men, if not as an Authority, and you and the Nation preserved in Peace, and the Force of the Wicked shall be turned backward, and you shall not suddenly fall. And the late sundry Overturnings in this Nation may be Examples to you, that you follow not the Steps of those that God hath cast out, lest you come to the same End of Confusion and Misery: For, as concerning

that Assembly of Men, that last sate on the Throne, something was done by them in their Day and Time, and in both their Assemblings, in some Things they served my Lord, and they were a Rod in his Hand to smite his Enemies; yet they were not faithful to the End, till all his Enemies were destroyed, but rather joined themselves to fight against the Lord and his People, and were hastening on towards the Way of Oppression and Persecution; and it was Time for the Lord to remove them, and to lay them aside as an empty Vessel, some∣time useful; and to break them as a Rod, sometime of Service to be a Scourge upon his Enemies: And when the Day of their Trial was over, which God gave unto them, being any longer (for present) un∣fit Instruments for his Hand, then he cast them into the Fire; and this his Purpose came to pass upon them: So that they and the whole Nation may be contented, and yield themselves subject to what he hath done concerning them; for they being entring into the very same Spirit of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> of <HI>Oppression</HI> and <HI>Persecution,</HI> which the Lord had once reproved thro' them, and cast out by them; then was a <HI>Rod</HI> raised up against them, even as they had been against others, and they were dealt withal as they had done to others; and this was in the Justice of my Lord's Hand: <HI>And what hath mortal Man to question his Proceedings?</HI> And tho' some of you (present Rulers) be look∣ed upon as <HI>great Traytors</HI> and <HI>Tyrants</HI> in your Dealing towards them, and doubtless the Men of that Part will seek Vengeance against you, even by <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Praying,</HI> and they will curse you in the Name of their <HI>God,</HI> and seek continually your <HI>Destruction,</HI> as such as have taken away Part of their <HI>Strength,</HI> and <HI>cast down their Idol;</HI> but alas! all this is nothing; for the Lord doth not account as Men: For these Things must needs thus come to pass, for the Furtherance of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> that it may arise thro' all; and if you were but faithful to what the Lord requires of you in your Proceedings, what you have done unto them should not be reck∣oned on Account against you, neither by God nor good Men. But and if you of the Army be always treacherous and disobedient to∣wards him, and abuse your Power, and disregard your Price, that God hath given you, and trifle away your Hour about Places of Honour, and such self-seeking Matters, and the Cause of God be neglected by you, and his People continued oppressed Sufferers under you, as they have long been;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka∣ble Prophecy.</NOTE> <HI>Even then shall you be cast aside with shameful Dis∣grace, and the heavy Hand of the Lord shall be upon you in Judgment, and you shall be smitten more than any before you; your Estates shall not be spa∣red from the Spoiler, nor your Souls from the Pit, nor your Persons from the Violence of Men, no, nor your Necks from the Axe: For if you be unfaithful, and continually treacherous to the Cause of God, then shall you be left to the Will of your Enemies, and they shall charge Treachery and Treason upon you, and your Persons and Estates shall be given for a Prey to your Enemies; and you shall not deliver your selves, neither will the Lord deliver you from the Execution of merciless Men; for my Lord shall leave the Cruel-hearted to plead with you.</HI>
Wherefore that you may be warned, I advise you to be faithful, let not the Cause of God fall, nor the Cause of his Enemies pros∣per before you; for there is no other Way whereby you can be pre∣served, nor no other Defence shall you ever find from the Wrath of the Lord, and from the Fury of your devouring Enemies, than your Faithfulness in God's Cause; and therefore relieve the Oppressed, and take off all Oppressions, break down all unjust Laws, and set all People free from unjust Burdens, and let all Oppression cease, both in Church and Civil State; and even all oppressive Laws, and unjust

Judges, and evil Men in Power, let all these be removed, and the Nation clean quitted and discharged even from all Men and Laws whatsoever, that have held under Oppression the Persons, Estates, and Consciences of the good People of this Land; and let the Nation be corrected, and all Orders and Places of Men, and Laws, and Decrees be purified; for this my Lord, the <HI>Great King</HI> requireth, and he will suddenly have it brought to pass in the Nation, if not by you, then contrary to you, and to your utter Destruction: And this is the very Substance of my Message to you, that my Master hath given me to say unto you; and on his Behalf I am come to claim of you my Ma∣ster's long lost Right; let him have his Right, from which he hath long been banished; I demand it of you, all ye whatsoever, that seem to bear Rule in the Nation; I charge you in his Name, let him have his Title and Prerogative, let him be Lord and King wholly in his own Kingdom, let him have the Exercise of his People's Consci∣ences by his own Spirit in all Things related to his Worship and Ser∣vice, and let him have the full Authority by his Spirit in all Things pertaining to Church, and Ministry, and Faith, and Religion; and let his Spirit have the alone Authority to perswade and disswade Peo∣ple from, or to such or such Ministry, Worship, and Practices of Religion; and <HI>let all forced Maintenance</HI> to Ministers, and Tithes be speedily taken away; and let all Laws and Decrees whatsoever, made and practised in the Days ot Antichrist, upon the Bodies, Estates, and Consciences of the People, in Oppression and Unjustness about Church, and Worship, and Religion, be utterly repealed, and made void, and never more be in Force in this Nation: But let my Lord be sole Ruler and Governor, and have the full Authority in his own Kingdom, in all Things whatsoever pertaining thereunto; and let no Man henceforth hereafter be intrusted with the Liberties of the Mem∣bers of Christ's Kingdom, as they are such, nor to judge over them in any Matters of Faith and Worship, but give that Right and Pri∣viledge wholly unto the Spirit of Jesus Christ; for unto him only it pertaineth, to be whole Judge, and to have full Power in his own Kingdom; and until you give him the Right, and deliver up unto him his own Kingdom, and the Exercise of People's Consciences in all Things about RELIGION, you shall never prosper, nor none that cometh after you, that shall in any measure abridge my Master of his proper RIGHT, from which he hath long been banished, as I have said; and till his Right be given him, in the Case aforesaid, <HI>He will dash one Man against another, and none shall ever be established,</HI> but Horn after Horn shall be broken, and one Power after another brought into Confusion.
And therefore, ye Men, do not strive with him in this Matter, but yield unto him the Exercise of your own Consciences by his Spi∣rit in you, and let him do so unto all others, even as ye hope to prosper, and upon the Penalty of his sore Displeasure upon you in this World, and in the World to come; and let just Men, and righ∣teous Men, and meek Men, and Men that have the Fear and Wisdom of God in them, without Acceptation of Birth, or otherwise; let such Men have the Power and Judgment committed to them, to de∣termine in Things between Man and Man.

not serve Places of Trust without so large Stipends; away with all these Things out of the Land, for they are heinous Oppressions unto Men, and great Abominations in the Sight of God, and the Land hath long groaned under the Weight and Burden of these Things, and the Earth is weary of them, and my Lord requires their utter Desolation, as being Iniquities fully ripe, and having the Guilt of so much Cruelty, Injustice, and Oppression lying upon the Nation be∣cause hereof, therefore this is the Lord's Season to destroy them, and remove them out of the Land; which if you be the Instruments in such a Work, it will be your greatest Crown, and your perpetual Honour; for the Lord's Purpose is one Way or other to cleanse the Land of all these and other Oppressions whatsoever, that the People of this Land may be a free People from all the heavy Yokes of Anti∣christ, which have long sorely pressed them down; and the Purpose of the Lord is to break the Yokes of Oppression and Tyranny from off the Necks of this People; and therefore it is that he overturneth, yea, <HI>and will overturn all Men and Authorities that shall oppose his Work, and none shall be able to stand before him;</HI> for the Presence of my Lord is more <HI>dreadful</HI> to a Nation, when he shews himself in Wrath, than any <HI>Multitude</HI> of armed Men; and Woe is unto you, if you be found opposing of him; and if you seek to stop his Work, <HI>you shall not cum∣ber the Earth very long, nor oppress the Nations many Days.</HI> Wherefore consider, <HI>Cursed will you be, if you be unfaithful in what you have to do on the Lord's Behalf; for your Hour passeth over that is allotted you, and will be suddenly expired, never to be recalled,</HI> and then you cannot work.</P>
<P>And whereas there is a great Cry about Ministry, <HI>For sending forth, and maintaining, and encouraging a godly Ministry,</HI> as you say.</P>
<P>Now to this I do answer on my Lord's Behalf, and I must <HI>tell you plainly;</HI> as for a true godly Ministry, <HI>truly called</HI> and <HI>sent</HI> of God, such a Ministry, and such Ministers, you can never be able to hinder; but the Lord <HI>will</HI> send them out, maintaining them and preserving them, whether you <HI>will</HI> or <HI>no;</HI> and while you are troubling your selves about such a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, you are but meddling with Things above your Line, and out of your Jurisdiction, while you act in such a Case; for it be∣longs to his Government to send out Ministers, whom, and as he will, and to maintain, and to defend them according to his own Pleasure, and all this without you; for such Ministers truly called thereunto, and sent of the Lord, will not seek to you to be sent forth, or main∣tained by you, they will not be beholden to you in such a Case; but even without you, and contrary to you, must they be sent out, and maintained: So that the Lord will have a Ministry in this Nation pure∣ly of his own, and not of Man, nor by Man, and such a Ministry you shall not be able to hinder.</P>
<P>And I must tell you plainly, As for these Men called Ministers, in this Nation, the Way of their setting up, and sending forth, and the Way of their Maintenance, and the Way of their Standing and De∣fence, and in every Particular of their being such, they are the great∣est and most woful Oppression in the Nation, even the most abomi∣nable and unjust Cruelties and Tyrannies are acted thro' them, as any 'other Thing in the Nation, and they are (as such aforesaid) the wo∣ful Cause of the Nation's groaning under merciless Dealing; and there is upon their Account the Guilt of <HI>Blood, Injustice,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> lying upon this Nation; their Iniquities, their Iniquities cry for Vengeance upon their own Heads; for they are <HI>full,</HI> they are <HI>full,</HI> and the Mea∣sure thereof is near finished, and God's eternal Vengeance is their next Reward from the eternal God.

them, and the righteous God is vexed thro' them, and they are the very Men of high Indignation and fierce Wrath, and all their Practi∣ces (as such) are the Fewel of his Anger, to be consumed by the Fire of his Jealousy; the Nation is weary, and its Inhabitants, and the Lord is weary because of these Men: And is this the Ministry cried up by you as <HI>godly</HI> and <HI>pious,</HI> &amp;c? Are these the Men that the Nati∣on must be forced to maintain in their <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Idolatry?</HI> Is this the Ministry that must be encouraged? Well, if these be the Men, and this the Ministry which must be established and encouraged by you, in so doing you shall never prosper, but thereby gain the Dis∣pleasure of the Almighty unto you, to bring a Curse upon all your Doings, even because hereof; for I must <HI>tell you,</HI> the Hand of my Lord is against them, and whosoever shall seek to defend them, <HI>shall not prosper in their Doings;</HI> because their <HI>Oppressions, Cruelties, Deceit,</HI> and <HI>Abominations</HI> are nigh <HI>finished and fulfilled:</HI> Wherefore take Heed unto your selves, for this is my Master's Advice unto you; <HI>Let this Mini∣stry alone, and join not your selves to</HI> Baal, <HI>lest you perish, neither take Part with Antichrist any longer, neither be ye Fighters against the Lamb and his Kingdom; but free the Nation, and let all its Inhabitants be freed from the cruel Tasks and Yokes of such Men, and such a Ministry as aforesaid; uphold it not against the Lord, for if you do, you shall never be established;</HI> and this is from the Mouth of my Lord unto you.</P>
<P>And last of all, My Master hath a People in this Nation, even a suffering People, that have born the Burden of the Cruelty and Inju∣stice, and Wickedness both of Rulers and Teachers, who have, as it were, trodden them down, and made them a very Prey to their de∣vouring Mouths; the very Cry of their Sufferings hath reached unto Heaven, and the very Sound thereof your Ears have heard; and this People are greatly <HI>beloved,</HI> and my Lord <HI>will assuredly honour them, and his Hand shall be continued to preserve them and defend them against all their Enemies whatsoever;</HI> and he doth reserve them to himself, and for a glorious Work that he hath to do by them; and he hath formed them for himself, and they cannot join with any of the Horns of the Great B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast, neither can a Place of Honour pervert them from their perfect Way; but my Lord, he compasseth them about on every Side, and hath kept them in the Midst of Trials, Reproaches and Sufferings, and covered them in the Heat, and in the Storm, <HI>till his Pleasure is to make further Ʋse of them;</HI> they are <HI>his,</HI> and not their <HI>own;</HI> and they must <HI>fulfil his Will,</HI> and none besides; and they lie at Rest in him, while Mountains are overturned, and while one Potsherd of the Earth breaks another; and this must be even till the appointed Time: And to say no more of them, tho' much more might be said, they are had in Remembrance before the Lord, to do with them even for his own Glory, and for this Nation's perpe∣tual Good; and to the Authority of the most High, thro' them, shall Kings of the Earth, and Nations of the World bow and trem∣ble; wherefore ye Men, touch them not, neither do ye afflict them, even as you hope to prosper; remember their Cause, and suffer it not always to be rejected, as it hath long been, but keep your selves free from the Injustice and Cruelty of them that have gone before you, who have been merciless, and Oppressors of that People, even till my Lord hath confounded them, and brought them into Confusion; for there is the Weight of Blood, of Tyranny and Oppression lying upon the Nation in that People's Cause, and my Lord will revenge them in his Season; and tho' they are not weary of their Sufferings, but are in the Patience which beareth all Things, yet the Nation can never be happy, nor its Government ever blessed,

while this People are held in Bondage; and their Sufferings are deeply considered of the Lord, and the Season thereof is expiring towards an End; and when this cometh to pass, then Woe unto the Kingdom of Antichrist, and to the Whore and false Prophet, even when their Strength is dried up, by which they have made War against the Lamb, and his Followers; yea, Woe unto them, great Fearfulness shall be upon all the World when the King of that People reigns upon the Earth, and the Time is at hand; blessed is the Man that waiteth for it, and blessed is he that is not offended in his Coming, but is prepared to re∣ceive him in his Appearing, which suddenly cometh upon all the World.</P>
<P>And thus I have told the Lord's present Message unto you, which I received from him, and thus far I am clear; and whether you ac∣cept it, or reject it, my Peace and Reward is for ever with him, who am a Subject of his Kingdom, and a Friend to this Nation, however otherwise judged by ignorant Men.</P>

It is true, you have made many Attempts to be revenged upon them, but you have not hitherto prospered; but could you be humbled, and come into the meek Spirit of the Lord, then might you prosper; but hitherto the Lord hath always defeated you, and bowed you down under a Peo∣ple as unworthy as others, but their Time will come to an End.

<P>This Order hath been answered effectually at large by <HI>G. Bishop,</HI> who shewed the Unreasonableness of this Work very plainly, from sa∣cred Writ, as from <HI>Amos</HI> ii. 6. where the Judgments of God are de∣nounced against those who <HI>Sold the Righteous for Silver, and the Poor for a Pair of Shoes;</HI> and from <HI>Levit.</HI> xxv. 42. where the making the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel Bond-men</HI> is expresly forbidden; this being not lawful, but in the Case of Theft, if the Thief had nothing to make Satisfac∣tion with. But to return to <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>Provided,</HI> there wanted nothing but the Execution of the said Order against them. Wherefore <HI>Ed∣mund Butter,</HI> one of the Treasurers, to get something of the Booty, sought out for Passage, to send them to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> for Sale; but none were willing to take or carry them: And a certain Master of a Ship, to put the Thing off, pretended, <HI>That thy would spoil all the Ship's Com∣pany.</HI> To which <HI>Butter</HI> returned, <HI>No, you need not fear that, for they are poor harmless Creatures, and will not hurt any Body. Will they not so,</HI> repli∣ed the Ship-master, <HI>And will you offer to make Slaves of such harmless Creatures?</HI> Thus <HI>Butter,</HI> maugre his wicked Intention, the Winter be∣ing at Hand, sent them home again to shift for themselves, till he could get a convenient Opportunity to send them away. It happened also in this Year, that a Girl, about eleven Years old, named <HI>Patience Scot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Girl 11 Tears sent to Prison.</NOTE> whose religious Mother had been cruelly whipt by these People, bore Witness against their wicked Persecution; which so incensed the Persecutors, that they sent her to Prison: And the Child having been examined, spoke so well to the Purpose, that she confounded her Enemies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answers no∣tably.</NOTE> some of which confest, that they had many Children, who had been well educated; and <HI>That it were well if they could say half so much for God, as she could for the Devil.</HI> But this Child not being of Years to be obnoxious to the Law, how wicked soever they were, it seems they could not resolve to proceed to Banishment, as they did with others.</P>
<P>All that hitherto I have said of the <HI>New-England</HI> Persecution, is but cursorily, and only a very small Part of those manifold Whippings that were inflicted there, besides the Extortions of Fines which were exorbi∣tant to a high Degree;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Maston</HI> fined unrea∣sonably.</NOTE> as may appear by what was done to <HI>William Maston</HI> at <HI>Hampton,</HI> who was fined ten Pounds for two Books found in his House, five Pounds for not frequenting their Church, and three Pounds, besides, as a Due to the Priest: and he not being free in Con∣science to pay this Fine, had taken from him what amounted to more than twenty Pounds. I find also that not long after this Time above a thousand Pounds was extorted from some only because they had separa∣ted themselves from the Persecuting Church:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exorbitant Sums levied by Distress.</NOTE> And it seems they were deemed such as were shut out from the Protection of the Law; inso∣much that <HI>Thomas Prince,</HI> Governour of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> did not stick to say, <HI>That in his Conscience the</HI> Quakers <HI>were such a People that deserved to be de∣stroyed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A barbarous Expression.</NOTE> they, their Wives, and Children, their Houses and Lands, without Pity or Mercy.</HI> I find also that one <HI>Humphry Norton at Newhaven,</HI> for being a <HI>Quaker,</HI> was whipt severely, and burnt in the Hand with the Letter <HI>H,</HI> to signify Heretick.</P>
<P>This Cruelty of the <HI>English,</HI> did also stir up the <HI>Dutch</HI> to Persecution: For without enquiring what kind of People the <HI>Quakers</HI> were, they seem'd ready to conclude them to be Men of pernicious Opinions, since those of their own Nation, who pretended to more Purity than other Protestants, did so severely persecute them.</P>

And making Enquiry after those that entertained him, he took into Custody two Women on that Occasion, one of which had two small Children, the one yet sucking at her Breast. Then they got a Cart and carried the Woman away in it, and <HI>Robert</HI> was fastened to the hinder Part of the Cart, pinioned, and so drawn thro' the Woods in the Night Season, whereby he was much torn and abused. And being come to <HI>New Amsterdam,</HI> now <HI>New York,</HI> he was loosed, and led, by the Rope with which he had been fastened to the Cart, to the Dungeon, being a filthy Place, full of Vermin; and the two Women were carried to another Place. Some Time after, he was examined, there being one Captain <HI>Willet,</HI> of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who had much incensed the Governour against him, who before had been mo∣derate. The Conclusion was, that a Sentence was read in <HI>Dutch to Robert,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His cruel and unrighteous Sentence, and Treatment.</NOTE> to this Effect, <HI>That he was to work two Years at the Wheel-barrow with a</HI> Negro, <HI>or pay or cause to be paid Six hundred Guilders.</HI> To this he attempted to make his Defence in a sober Way, but was not suffered to speak, and sent to the Dungeon again; where no <HI>English</HI> were suf∣fered to come to him. After some Days he was taken out, and pinion'd and being set with his Face towards the Court-chamber, his Hat was taken off, and another Sentence read to him in <HI>Dutch,</HI> which he did not understand: But that it displeased many of that Nation, did appear by the Shaking of their Heads. Then he was cast again into the Dun∣geon, where he was kept some Days. At length betimes in a Morn∣ing, he was haled out, and chained to a Wheel-barrow, and command∣ed to work: To which he answered, <HI>He was never brought up, nor used to such a Work.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its rigorous and barba∣rous Executi∣on.</NOTE> Upon which they made a Negro to take a pitch'd Rope, nigh four Inches about, and to beat him; who did so, till <HI>Robert</HI> fell down. Then they took him up again, and caused the Negro to beat him with the said Rope, until he fell down the second Time, and it was believed that he received about one Hundred Blows. Thus he was kept all that Day in the Heat of the Sun, chained to the Wheel-barrow; and his Body being much bruised and swelled with the Blows, and he kept without Food, grew very faint, and sate upon the Ground, with his Mind retired to the Lord, and resigned to his Will, whereby he felt himself supported. At Night he was lock'd up again in the Dungeon; and the next Morning he was chain'd again to the Wheel-barrow, and a Sentinel set over him, that none might come so much as to speak with him. On the third Day he was had forth, and chained in like Manner; and no Wonder that he still refused to work; for besides the Unreasonableness of requiring such a servile Work of him who had committed no Evil, he was not in a Condition to perform it, being made altogether unable by the cruel Blows given him. In this weak State he was brought before the Governour, who demanded him <HI>to work; otherwise,</HI> he said, <HI>He should be whipt every Day. Robert</HI> ask∣ed him, <HI>What Law he had broken? and called for his Accusers, that he might know his Transgression.</HI> But instead of an Answer, he was chained to the Wheel-barrow again, and threaten'd, that <HI>If he spoke to any one, he should be punished worse.</HI> Yet he did not forbear to speak to some that came to him, so as he saw meet, and thought convenient. Then seeing
<PB N="221" REF="003104_0232_0FEFF546591DAC18"/>
they could not keep him silent, they put him into the Dungeon again, and kept him close there several Days, and two Nights, one Day and a half of it, without Bread or Water. After this he was brought very early in the Morning into a private Room,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is hung up by up Hands and whipt.</NOTE> and stript to the Waste, and hung up by his Hands, and a great Leg of Wood tied to his Feet, so that he could not turn his Body, and then a strong Negro was set to whip him with Rods; who laid many Stripes upon him, which cut his Flesh ve∣ry much. Then he was let down again, and put into the Dungeon as be∣fore, and none suffered to come to him. Two Days after, he was had forth again, and hung up as before, and many more Stripes were laid upon him by another Negro. He almost fainting, and not knowing but his Life might be taken away, desired that some <HI>English</HI> might be suffered to come to him: Which was granted, and an <HI>English</HI> Woman came, and washed his Stripes, finding him brought so low, that she thought he would not live till the next Morning. And she telling this to her Husband, it made such an Impression upon him, that he went to the Fiscal, and prof∣fered him a fat Ox, to suffer <HI>Robert</HI> to be at his House until he was well again. But the Fiscal would not permit this, unless the whole Fine was paid. And tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were some, that would willingly have paid the Fine for him, yet he could not consent to it; but within three Days af∣ter he had thus been whipped, he was made whole and as strong as be∣fore, and was free to labour, that he might not be burthensome to any. Some others of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> (who came thither from the Plan∣tations in <HI>New England</HI> to enjoy Liberty of Conscience, and whose Names and Sufferings I pass by for Brevity's Sake) met also with hard Mea∣sure from the Governor, by the Instigation of the aforesaid Captain <HI>Willet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is dis∣miss'd with∣out paying a Fine, thro' In∣ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of the Governor's Sister</NOTE> Robert</HI> now, tho' guiltless, being kept like a Slave to hard Work, it raised Compassion in many, and the Governor's Sister, who was much affected with his Sufferings, became instrumental in obtaining his Li∣berty; for she so ply'd her Brother, that he at length set him free without paying one Penny, or any Body for him; by which the Go∣vernor shewed, that tho' he had been too easily wrought upon to com∣mit Evil, yet he was not come near to that Height of Malice, as the <HI>New England</HI> Persecutors,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New-Eng∣gland</HI> Perse∣cutors more cruel than the <HI>Dutch.</HI></NOTE> who increased in their Hard-heartedness, and became inur'd to Cruelty. Insomuch that if any one amongst them would not give his Vote for Persecution, he was counted unworthy to be a Magistrate; as appears by a Letter of one <HI>James Cudworth,</HI> written some Time before to one of his Friends in <HI>Old England,</HI> wherein I meet with these Words;</P>
<P><HI>As for the State and Condition of Things amongst us, it is sad: The Anti∣christian persecuting Spirit is very active, and that in the Powers of this World. He that will not whip and lash, persecute and punish Men that differ in Matters of Religion, must not sit on the Bench, nor sustain any Office in the Common∣wealth. Last Election, Mr.</HI> Hatherly <HI>and my self left the Bench, and my self was discharged of my Captainship, because I had entertained some of the</HI> Quakers <HI>at my House, that thereby I might be the better acquainted with their Principles. I thought it better to do so, than with the blind World to censure, condemn, rail at, and revile them, when they neither saw their Persons, nor knew any thing of their Principles. But the</HI> Quakers <HI>and my self cannot close in divers Things; and so I signified to the Court, I was no</HI> Quaker, <HI>but must give my, Testimony against sundry Things that they held, as I had Occasion and Opportunity. But withal I told them, That as I was no</HI> Quaker, <HI>so I would be no Persecutor.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the Se∣quel, <HI>New-England judged,</HI> Part <HI>1. p. 168.</HI></NOTE></P>

without any Ʋnwillingness. That this was the Cause why after Banishment, on Pain of Death, he slaid in their Jurisdiction.

This Paper being handed to <HI>Indicot,</HI> he read it to himse1f, and af∣ter he had done, said to <HI>Robinson, You need not keep such ado to have it read; for you spoke Yesterday more than here is written.</HI> Yet this was not so; for it contained a circumstantial Relation of the divine Operations on his Mind; <HI>and that he was not come there, in his own Will, but in Obedience to his Creator: And that travelling in</HI> Rhode-Island, <HI>on the 8th of the 8th Month, he had been moved thereto from the Lord, and therefore had submitted to his divine Pleasure without murmuring. W. Robinson</HI> desiring again that the Paper might he read, that so all that were present might hear it, it was denied him; and <HI>Indicot</HI> said, <HI>W.

thee a Prophet unto the Nations.</HI>— And at the hearing of the Word of the Lord, I was put to a Stand, being that I was but a Child for such a weighty Matter.

And I believed that the Lord would perform what he had spoken, because I was made willing to give up my self to his Work and Service, to leave all and follow him, whose Presence and Life is with me, where I rest in Peace and Quietness of Spirit (with my dear Brother) under the Shadow of his Wings, who hath made us willing to lay down our Lives for his own Name-sake, if unmerciful Men be suffered to take them from us; and if they do, we know we shall have Peace and Rest with the Lord for ever in his holy Habitation, when they shall have Torment Night and Day. So, in Obedience to the living God, I made Preparation to pass to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> in the 4th Month, 1658. So, after I had been some Time on the said Island in the Service of God, I heard that <HI>New-Eng∣gland</HI> had made a Law to put the Servants of the living God to Death, if they returned after they were sentenced away, which did come near me at that Time; and as I consider'd the Thing, and ponder'd it in my Heart, immediately came the Word of the Lord unto me, saying,— <HI>Thou knowest not but that thou may'st go thither.</HI>— But I kept this Word in my Heart, and did not declare it to any until the Time appointed. So after that, a Vessel was made ready for <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> which I passed in.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To the</HI> General Court <HI>in</HI> BOSTON.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS I am by many charged with the Guiltiness of my own Blood; if you mean in my coming to <HI>Boston,</HI> I am there∣in clear, and justified by the Lord, in whose Will I came, who will require my Blood of you, be sure, who have made a Law to take a∣way the Lives of the innocent Servants of God, if they come among you, who are called by you, <HI>Cursed Quakers;</HI> altho' I say, and am a living Witness for them and the Lord, that he hath blessed them, and sent them unto you; therefore be not found Fighters against God, but let my Counsel and Request be accepted with you, To repeal all such Laws, that the Truth and Servants of the Lord may have free Passage among you, and you be kept from shedding innocent Blood, which I know there are many among you would not do, if they knew

it so to be; nor can the Enemy that stirreth you up thus to destroy this holy Seed, in any Measure countervail the great Damage that you will, by thus doing, procure. Therefore seeing the Lord hath not hid it from me, it lieth upon me, in Love to your Souls, thus to perswade you. I have no Self-ends, the Lord knoweth; for if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren, and the Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two Years; and now it is like to encrease, even unto Death, for no evil Doing, but coming among you. Was ever the like Laws heard of among a People that pro∣fess Christ come in the Flesh? And have such no other Weapons but such Laws to fight against spiritual Wickedness withal, as you call it? Woe is me for you? Of whom take ye Counsel? Search with the Light of Christ in you, and it will shew you of whom, as it hath done me and many more, who have been disobedient and deceived, as now ye are: Which Light as you come into, and obeying what is made manifest to you therein, you will not repent that you were kept from shedding Blood, tho' it were by a Woman. It is not mine own Life I seek, (for I chuse rather to suffer with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of <HI>Egypt)</HI> but the Life of the Seed, which I know the Lord hath blessed, and therefore seeks the Enemy thus vehemently to destroy the Life thereof, as in all Ages he ever did. O hearken not unto him, I beseech you, for the Seed's-Sake, which is one in all, and is dear in the Sight of God, which they that touch, touch the Apple of his Eye, and cannot es∣cape his Wrath; whereof I having felt, cannot but persuade all Men that I have to do withal, especially you who name the Name of Christ, to depart from such Iniquity, as <HI>shedding Blood, even of the Saints of the Most High,</HI> Therefore let my Request have as much Ac∣ceptance with you, if you be Christians, as <HI>Esther's</HI> had with <HI>Ahasue∣rus,</HI> whose Relation is short of That that's between Christians; and my Request is the same that hers was: And he said not, that he had made a Law, and that it would be dishonourable for him to revoke it; but when he understood that those People were so prized by her, and so nearly concerned her, as in Truth these are to me, you may see what he did for her. Therefore I leave these Lines with you, appeal∣ing to the faithful and true Witness of God, which is one in all Con∣sciences, before whom we must all appear; with whom I shall eternal∣ly rest, in everlasting Joy and Peace, whether you will hear or for∣bear. With him is my Reward, with whom to live is my Joy, and to die is my Gain, tho' I had not had your Forty eight Hours Warn∣ing, for the Preparation of the Death of <HI>Mary Dyar.</HI></P>
<P>And know this also, that if thro' the Enmity you shall declare your selves worse than <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> and confirm your Law, tho' it were but by taking away the Life of one of us, that the Lord will overthrow both your Law and you, by his righteous Judgments and Plagues poured justly upon you, who now whilst ye are warned thereof, and tenderly sought unto, may avoid the one, by removing the other. If you neither hear, nor obey the Lord nor his Servants, yet will he send more of his Servants among you, so that your End shall be frustrated, that think to restrain them ye call <HI>cursed Quakers,</HI> from coming among you by any Thing you can do to them. Yea, verily, he hath a Seed here among you, for whom we have suffered all this while, and yet suffer; whom the Lord of the Harvest will send forth more Labourers to gather, out of the Mouths of the Devourers of all Sorts, into his Fold, where he will lead them into fresh Pastures, even the

Paths of Righteousness, for his Name's-sake. Oh, let none of you put this good Day far from you, which verily in the Light of the Lord I see approaching, even to many in and about <HI>Boston</HI> which is the bitterest and darkest professing Place, and so to continue so long as you have done, that ever I heard of. Let the Time past therefore suffice, for such a Profession as brings forth such Fruits as these Laws are. In Love and in the Spirit of Meekness, I again beseech you, for I have no Enmity to the Persons of any; but you shall know, that God will not be mocked; but what ye sow, that shall ye reap from him, that will render to every one according to the Deeds done in the Body, whether Good or Evil.

No Eye can see, no Ear can hear, no Tongue can utter, and no Heart can understood the sweet Incomes, or Influence, and the Refreshings of the Spirit of the Lord, which now I feel.</HI> Thus going along, <HI>W. Robinson</HI> said, <HI>This is your Hour, and the Power of Darkness.</HI> But presently the Drums were beaten; yet shortly after, the Drummers leaving off beating, <HI>Marmaduke Stevenson</HI> said, <HI>This is the Day of your Visitation, wherein the Lord hath visited you.</HI> More he spoke, but could not be understood, by reason of the Drums being beat∣en again. Yet they went on with great Chearfulness, as going to an everlasting Wedding-Feast, and rejoicing that the Lord had counted them worthy to suffer Death for his Name's Sake.

the Executioner being about turning him off, he said, <HI>I suffer for Christ in whom I live, and for whom I die.</HI> He being turned off, <HI>Marmaduke Ste∣venson</HI> stept up the Ladder, and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robinson's <HI>Last Words.

And <HI>Mary Dyar</HI>seeing now her Companions hanging dead before her, also stept up the Ladder; but after her Coats were tied about her Feet, the Halter put about her Neck, and her Face covered with a Handkerchief, which the Priest <HI>Wilson</HI> lent the Hangman, just as she was to be turned off, a Cry was heard, <HI>Stop, for she is reprieved.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary Dyar reprieved</NOTE> Her Feet then being loosed, they bad her come down.

The Magistrates now perceiving that the putting <HI>William Robinson</HI> and <HI>Marmaduke Stevenson</HI> to Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sent home∣wards and left at Liber∣ty</NOTE> caused great Discontent among the People, resolved to send away <HI>Mary Dyar,</HI> thereby to calm their Minds a little. And so she was put on Horseback, and by four Horse-Men conveyed fifteen Miles towards <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> where she was left with a Horse and a Man, to be conveyed the rest of the Way; which the soon sent back, and so repaired home.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her Charac∣ter</NOTE> By the Stile of her Letters, and her undaunted Carriage, it appears that she had indeed some ex∣traordinary Qualities, I find also, that she was of a comely and grave Countenance, of a good Family and Estate, and a Mother of several Children: But her Husband it seems was of another Perswasion.</P>
<P>Whilst I now leave her at Home,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Chamber∣lain</HI> and <HI>E. Wharton</HI> whipped, and the last also fined.</NOTE> I am to say, that one <HI>John Cham∣berlain,</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Boston,</HI> having seen the Execution of <HI>William Robinson,</HI> and <HI>M. Stevenson,</HI> was so reached by their pious Speeches, that he received the Doctrine of the Truth, for which they died: But his vi∣siting those in Prison, was so ill resented, that afterwards he was whipp'd several Times severely; as was also <HI>Edward Wharton,</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Salem,</HI> who having said, that <HI>the Guilt of</HI> Robinson's <HI>and</HI> Stevenson's <HI>Blood was so great and heavy that he was not able to bear it,</HI> was for this his pretended Sauciness, whipp'd with twenty Lashes and fined twen∣ty Pounds.</P>
<P>But before I quite leave the Persons that were hang'd, I must say, that being dead, their Countenance still look'd fresh (for the Terror of Death had not seized them.) But being cut down, they were very bar∣barously used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bodies of the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uted inhumanly used.</NOTE> none taking hold of their Bodies; which so fell down on the Ground, that thereby the Skull of <HI>W.

And when some of their Friends would have said their Bodies into Coffins, it was denied them. Neither would they suffer the Place where the Bodies were cast, to be senced with Pales, lest ravenous Beasts might prey upon them.</P>
<P>When the People returned from the Execution, many seemed sad, and heavy; and coming to the Draw-bridge, one End of it fell upon some, and several were hurt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Miserable End of a Wo∣man who re∣viled them at their Death</NOTE> especially a wicked Woman, who had reviled the said two Persons at their Death; but now she was so bruised, that her Flesh rotted from her Bones, which made such a noisome Stink that People could not endure to be with her: In which miserable Con∣dition the remained till she died. But the Magistrates, instead of tak∣ing Notice of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest <HI>Wilson</HI> make Bal∣lad on them</NOTE> grew more hardened; and Priest <HI>Wilson</HI> did not stick to make a Ballad on the Executed.</P>
<P>Now I return again to <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> who being come to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> went from thence to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> where she staid the most Part of the Winter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M.Dyar</HI> re∣turns to Boston.</NOTE> and then coming home again, she was moved to return to the bloody Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> whither she came, on the 21st of the Third Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sent for by the Court and examined.</NOTE> in the Year 1660, and on the 31st she was sent for by the Ge∣neral Court. Being come there, the Governor <HI>John Indicot</HI> said, <HI>Are you the same</HI> Mary Dyar <HI>that was here before?</HI> And it seems he was prepa∣ring an Evasion for her, there having been another of that Name re∣turned from <HI>Old England.</HI> But she was so far from disguising, that she answered undauntedly, <HI>I am the same</HI> Mary Dyar <HI>that was here the last General Court.</HI> Then <HI>Indicot</HI> said, <HI>You will own your self a</HI> Quaker, <HI>will you not?</HI> To which <HI>Mary Dyar, I own myself to be reproachfully called so.</HI> Then the Jailor (who would also say something) said, <HI>she is a Vagabond.</HI> And <HI>Indicot</HI> said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And is again sentenc'd to D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>b by in∣dicot</NOTE> <HI>The Sentence was pass'd upon her the last General Court, and now likewise: You must return to the Prison, and there remain until to Morrow at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from thence you must go to the Gallows, and there be hang'd

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL these Overturnings, and almost wonderful Changings were effected thro' the Justice of the Lord's Hand— You are now again at the Stern of Government, and on the Throne; and I dare not but say, it is of and by the Lord, and that he hath done it con∣trary to the Expectations of many; and what his End is in it, remains with him. But I am sure one Cause is, that you may execute Part of his Wrath upon that treacherous Generation of hypocritical and deceitful Men, some of the Army I mean.— I need not say to you, how that many of them were raised up from a low Estate; and instead of serving the Nation, became their Lords and Oppressors: They have abused the Lord's Mercy to them, and exalted themselves, and become as great Oppressors, and as grievous to the Nation, as ever they were that went before them; and some of them took the very Titles and Estates or their Enemie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and followed their evil Spi∣rit also, tho' the Lord was long-suffering to them, and gave them a <HI>Day,</HI> and put Opportunity into their Hands, wherein they might have done Good; but they also neglected to serve God and the Nation, to serve themselves; and because of the Ambition and Pride of some of them, the Lord suffered them to make this last Interruption upon you, which was great <HI>Treachery</HI> in Man's Account, that thereby their Measure might be filled up, and that he might give you Occasion against them, and suffer you to be filled with Indignation towards them, to break them to Pieces: And what you do to some of them, in casting them out, and afflicting them, you are but God's Executi∣oners therein; you are the Executioners of his Anger, in what you do to them; and who shall prevent you, or forbid you to go on? For they have long enough dissembled with this Nation, in profes∣sing more than others, and doing less; and their <HI>Downfal</HI> is now. And God hath looked upon you to be hard-hearted and cruel enough, and very fit Executioners of Vengeance upon such Men, as I have men∣tioned.</P>
<P>But now concerning you, and your present State, as you are in pre∣sent Place and Power, I have something to say to you; tho they are fallen, and you yet stand, and you have a little Time after them; but this I say, do not glory over their <HI>Fall,</HI> neither glory as tho' you should stand for ever; for they were not greater Sinners than you are, neither are you one whit more righteous than some of them; but you are as sure to fall, as they are fallen, with no less Measure of Dis∣honour and Affliction than is come upon them; and you are in your last Hour; and I dare not say, that God expects much more from you, than for the End aforesaid <HI>(viz) To be the Executioners of Justice upon Men as sinful as your selves:</HI> So do not glory over them that are fallen; but know that your Time also is but short, and your Fall may prove to your Destruction, and theirs may prove to make them hotter, and refine them: And if God hath chosen you to execute some Part of his Wrath upon them, for their <HI>Wickedness,</HI> he will doubtless find Instruments to execute his Wrath upon you, else he will do it with his own Hand; for he purposeth not to spare you; for your Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

as loud as any other People's and the <HI>Oppressions</HI> are as great under you, as under them whom you condemn. And I desire, if there be any good Men amongst you, that such who are wise may consider, and mind the Hand of the Lord in and thro' all these Things that are come to pass; for God is working as well as you, he is seeking to set up a Kingdom as well as you, and his Government and yours cannot stand together; and he will make you know that he is stronger, and his Government of more Force, and your Kingdom cannot stand in Place with his. Therefore, Oh that you would take hee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! Oh that you would be wise, if so be some of you may be spared! and be not too zealous in your Way, nor too furious in your Proceedings? <HI>do but to others at you intend to receive from others, and from the Lord;</HI> and go not beyond your Com∣mission; for a Permission at least you have had from God, even to scourge Hypocrites, and to be a Judgment upon that hypocritical seeming religious Generation of Men aforesaid, which have many a Time, as it were, mocked God, and pretended Love to him with their Lips, when their Hearts have yearned after Self-Honour, and Trea∣sures of this World: I say, your present Hour and Permission is for this End, but not to persecute the People of the Lord, nor to destroy God's Heritage; but if you shall extend your Power unto such a Work, and if you do persecute the innocent without Cause, and make War against the Lamb and his Followers, and make Laws, and execute them to the Oppression of the Saints of the most high, then you go beyond your Commission; for God hath not called you un∣to this, but to be Instruments in another Cause. And the Children of <HI>Zion</HI> they trust in the living God, and fear not the Terror of migh∣ty Men, neither can they be afraid at the Roaring of the Sea, nor at the present Threatning of the Heathen; for God is with them. And I say unto you, the Servant of the Lord hath ponder'd and consider'd all these proceedings, and viewed the present State of Things at this Day, and there is no Vision from God unto you of Peace and Com∣fort, nor of a happy and lasting Government, as you now stand. If any Prophet shall divine this unto you, he speaks what he hath not from the Lord, but the Vision of his own Heart, and he deceives you and himself; for you are not established upon a right Founda∣tion, neither are you acted by a right Spirit, which can truly govern for God; but the Spirit of Wrath and Fury is put into you, for the Work which you are called. And I know not how to warn you that you do not persecute the People of God: <HI>For why?</HI> It may be you must fill up your Measure of Wickedness thereby, that God may break you perpetually; yet the less will be your Judgment, if you do it not: But and if you do it, the Lord will take Occasion against you, to wound you, and you shall never be healed; and as you do afflict others, so and much more shall it be done unto you from the Lord. Wherefore consider what I have said; for this is the Vision of the Almighty unto you, that shall not go unfulsilled: And what you do, you must do it quickly; for your Time is short, and your Power will God subdue; and his Kingdom and Power will he speedi∣ly exalt over your Heads, and make you and the Nations know, that he is God, and that all Power is with him, and that he can do what∣soever he will; and it is his Right alone to reign, and his Childrens Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion to possess the Kingdom with him. Let the whole Earth, and all the Powers thereof, bow and tremble before him: Let not your Hearts be stout and rebellious against him; for he can grind you to Powder, and sink you into Confusion and Misery, as a Stone into the Sea.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter being printed, a Copy of it was given to each Parliament-Man, before <HI>Monk,</HI> with his Army, came into <HI>London:</HI> And how soon the Predictions contained therein, as well as those of <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> in the foregoing Year, came to be fulfilled, when many of the great Ones were hang'd and quarter'd, we shall see in the Sequel.</P>
<P>General <HI>Monk</HI> came now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General <HI>Monk</HI> pre∣tends to be true to the Parliament and Common-wealth, but serves the In∣terest of <HI>Cha. Stuart.</HI></NOTE> with Part of the Army he commanded, out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and made also great Alterations among the Officers, putting in such as were believed to be no Enemies to <HI>Charles Stuart;</HI> for whatsoever <HI>Monk</HI> said of his Resolution to be true and faith∣ful to the Parliament, and to promote the Interest of a Common-wealth, yet it appear'd 'ere long that he aimed at something else; which he could do the easier, because he wanted not Adherents in the Parliament; tho' he did not stick to say to <HI>Edmund Ludlow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Saying to <HI>Ludlow</HI> and to others. Excluded Members re∣turn: Sir <HI>G. Booth</HI> set at Liberty, and</NOTE> We must live and die for and with a Common-wealth:</HI> And to others he declared, <HI>That he would oppose to the utmost the setting up of</HI> Charles Stuart. In the mean while he so ordered it, that many Members of the Parliament, that had been long excluded as unqualified, took Session again in that Assembly; and these brought it about, that Sir <HI>George Booth,</HI> who was consined to the <HI>Tower,</HI> for having carried on a Design for <HI>Charles Stuart,</HI> was set at Li∣berty. Neither was the City of <HI>London</HI> in a Condition to oppose <HI>Monk;</HI> for he caused the Port-cullies, and Doors of the City-gates, and the Posts to be pulled down; and the Royalists were now become so bold, that they printed a List of the Names of the Judges that condemned King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st to Death; and some of them were secured, whilst others fled away. General <HI>Lambert</HI> was also sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and <HI>Monk,</HI> whose Authority now encreased, sent for the Lords, who until the Year 1648, had sate in Parliament, and bad them return to the House where they formerly used to sit.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="003104_0245_0FEFF5190BEAC030"/>In these Overturnings <HI>G. Fox</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> to wit, in the Time when they were breaking the City-Gates.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> writes to those in Power.</NOTE> He then wrote a Paper to those that were now sinking, and told them, <Q>That now the Prophe∣cies were fulfilling upon them, which had been spoken to them; and that they who used to call the <HI>Quakers</HI> Fanaticks, and Giddy-heads, now seemed themselves giddy, and Fugitives, or Wanderers.</Q></P>
<P>From <HI>London G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Sussex,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And from <HI>London</HI> goes into <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Dorset∣shire,</HI> has a great Meeting at <HI>Dorchester</HI> where he is suspected for a Jesuit; then passes into <HI>So∣mersetshire.</HI></NOTE> and from thence to <HI>Dorsetshire.</HI> At <HI>Dorchester</HI> he had a great Meeting in the Evening, at the Inn where he lodged, and there came many Soldiers who were pretty civil. But the Constables and Officers of the Town came also under Pretence to look for a Jesuit, whose Head, they said, was shaved. So they took off <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Hat, but not finding any bald Place on his Head, they went away with Shame. This was of good Service among the Soldiers and others, and it affected the People, who were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Then he passed into <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> where his Friends Meetings were often disturbed. One Time there came a wicked Man, who having a Bear's Skin on his Back, plaid ugly Pranks in the Meeting; and setting himself opposite to the Person that was preaching, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olled his Tongue out of his Mouth, and so made Sport for his wicked Followers, and caused great Disturbance in the Meeting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dreadful Judgment on a Scoffer.</NOTE> But as he went back from thence, an eminent Judgment overtook him; for there being a Bull-baiting in the Way, he staid to see; and coming within his Reach, the Bull push'd his Horn under the Man's Chin, into his Throat, and for∣ced his Tongue out of his Mouth, so that it hung out in the same Manner as before he lolled it out in Derision in the Meeting: And the Bull running his Horn into the Man's Head, swung him about in a most fearful Manner.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> travelling thro' <HI>Somersetshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">From <HI>Somer∣setshire G. Fox</HI> comes into <HI>Devon∣shire,</HI> so to the Land's End in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and writes a∣gainst the wic∣ked practice of making Spoil of Ship∣wrecks.</NOTE> came into <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and so went into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> till he came to the Land's End. Whilst he was in <HI>Corn∣wal,</HI> there were great Shipwrecks about the Land's End. Now it was the Custom of that Country, that at such Times both Rich and Poor went out to get as much of the Wreck as they could, not caring to save the People's Lives; and this Custom so prevailed, that in some Parts of the Country they called Shipwrecks, <HI>God's Grace.</HI> This grie∣ved <HI>G. Fox</HI> not a little, considering how far these professed Christians were below the Heathen at <HI>Melita,</HI> who courteously received <HI>Paul,</HI> and the others that had suffered Shipwreck with him, and made him a Fire. On this Consideration, he was moved to write a Paper to the Magistrates, Priests, and others, both high and low; in which he shew∣ed them <Q>The Wickedness of their Deeds, and reproved them for such greedy Actions, telling them how they were ready to fight with one another for the Spoil, and spend what they got in Taverns or Ale-houses, letting those that escaped drowning, go a begging up and down the Country. Therefore he seriously exhorted them, to do un∣to others, what they would have done to themselves.</Q></P>
<P>This Paper he sent to all the Parishes thereabouts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several emi∣nent People in <HI>Cornwal</HI> con∣vinced by <HI>G.

Having heard this he desired <HI>George Bishop, Thomas Gouldney, Thomas Speed,</HI> and <HI>Edward Pyot</HI> to go to the Mayor and Aldermen, and desire them to let his Friends have the Town-hall to meet in, provided it should not be on such Days when the Mayor and Aldermen had Bu∣siness to do in it; and that for this Use they would give Twenty Pounds a Year, to be distributed amongst the Poor. These four Persons were astonished at this Proposal, and said, <HI>The Mayor and Aldermen would think

them mad;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Counsel and Encourage∣ment were kept quiet a good while after.</NOTE> <HI>for the Mayor and Commander of the Soldiers had combined toge∣ther to make a Disturbance in their Meetings.</HI> But <HI>G. fox</HI> so encouraged them, that at last they consented to what he desired: Being come to the Mayor, he was moderate beyond Expectation; and when they had laid the Thing before him, he said, <HI>For his Part, he could consent to it; but he was but one.</HI> So they left him in a loving Frame of Mind; and coming back; <HI>G. Fox</HI> desired them to go also to the Colonel that com∣manded the Soldiers, and to acquaint him of their rude Carriage, and how they disturbed the Meetings. But the aforesaid four Persons were backward to go to him. Next Morning being the first Day of the Week, a Meeting was kept in an Orchard, where many People came; and after <HI>G. Fox</HI> had been preaching a pretty while, there came several rude Soldiers, some with drawn Swords, and some drunk, and among these one that had bound himself with an Oath, <HI>To cut down, and kill the Man that spoke.</HI> But when he came pressing in thro' the Crowd, and was within two Yards of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he stopp'd at those four Persons before mentioned, and fell a jangling with them; but at length his Sword was put up again. The next Day they went and spoke with the Colonel; and he having heard how mischievous his Soldiers had been, sent for them, and cut and slash'd some of them. When this was told <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he blamed those his Friends, thinking they might have prevented the cutting of the Soldiers, if they had gone to the Colonel when he would have had them. Yet this had such Effect, that the Meeting there was kept without Disturbance a good while after.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> then also had a general Meeting at <HI>Edward Pyot</HI>'s near <HI>Bristol,</HI> at which were several Thousands of People, and so many of <HI>Bristol,</HI> that some said, <HI>The City look'd naked:</HI> And all was quiet.</P>
<P>But in other Places about this Time Things were not so quiet; for the Soldiers under General <HI>Monk</HI>'s Command, were often very rude in disturbing of Meetings. But when Complaint was made to him, who was then at <HI>Westminster,</HI> he shewed that he would not countenance such Wickedness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. <HI>Monk</HI> gives out an Order against the Soldiers disturbing Friends Meetings.</NOTE> and did in that Respect better than several other Generals had done: for he gave forth the following Order:</P>

which is spread over the whole Kingdom, doth not awaken all Men to a De∣sire and Longing that those Wounds which have for so many Years together been kept bleeding, may be bound up, all we can say will be to no Purpose. However, after this long Silence, we have thought it our Duty to declare, how much we de∣sire to contribute thereunto: And that, as we can never give over the Hope in good Time to obtain the Possession of that Right which God and Nature hath made our Due, so we do make it our daily Suit to the Divine Providence, that he will, in Compassion to us and our Subjects, after so long Misery and Sufferings, remit and put us into a quiet and peaceable Possession of that our Right with as lit∣tle Blood and Damage to our People as is possible. Nor do we desire more to en∣joy what is ours, than that all our Subjects may enjoy what by Law is theirs, by a full and entire Administration of Justice throughout the Land, and by extending our Mercy where it is wanted and desired.</P>
<P>And to the End that the Fear of Punishment may not engage any, conscious to themselves of what is past, to a Perseverance in Guilt for the future, by opposing the Quiet and Happiness of their Country, in the Restoration both of King, Peers, and People to their just, ancient, and fundamental Rights: We do by these Pre∣sents declare, that we do grant a free and general Pardon, which we are ready upon Demand to pass under our great Seal of
<HI>England,</HI> to all our Subjects, of what Degree or Quality soever, who within forty Days after the publishing hereof, shall lay hold upon this our Grace and Favour, and shall by any publick Act de∣clare their doing so, and that they return to the Loyalty and Obedience of good Subjects, excepting only such Persons as shall hereafter be excepted by Parliament: those only excepted, let all our Subjects, how faulty soever, rely upon the Word of a King, solemnly given by this present Declaration, that no Crime whatsoever, committed against us, or our Royal Father, before the Publication of this, shall ever rise in Judgment, or be brought in Question against any of them, to the least Endamagement of them, either in their Lives, Liberties or Estates, or as far forth as lies in our Power, so much as to the Prejudice of their Reputations, by any Reproach or Term of Distinction from the rest of our best Subjects; we desiring and ordaining, that henceforward all Notes of Discord, Separation, and Difference of Parties, be utterly abolished among all our Subjects, whom we invite and con∣jure to a perfect Ʋnion among themselves, under our Protection, for the Reset∣tlement of our just Rights and theirs in a free Parliament, by which, upon the Word of a King, we will be advised.</P>
<P>And because the Passion and Ʋncharitableness of the Times have produced seve∣ral Opinions in Religion, by which Men are engaged in Parties and Animosities against each other, which, when they shall hereafter unite in a Freedom of Conver∣sation, will be composed or better understood: We do declare a Liberty to tender Consciences, and that no Man shall be disquieted or called in question for Differ∣ences of Opinion in Matter of Religion, which do not disturb the Peace of the King∣dom, and that we shall be ready to consent to such an Act of Parliament, as upon mature Deliberation shall be offered to us for the full granting that Indulgence.</P>
<P>And because in the continual Distractions of so many Years, and so many and great Revolutions, many Grants and Purchases of Estates have been made to, and by many Officers, Soldiers, and others, who are now possessed of the same, and who may be liable to Actions at Law upon several Titles, We are likewise wil∣ling that all such Differences, and all Things relating to such Grants, Sales, and Purchases shall be determined in Parliament, which can best provide for the just Satisfaction of all Men who are concerned.</P>
<P>And we do farther declare, that we will be ready to consent to any Act or Acts of Parliament to the Purposes aforesaid, and for the full Satisfaction of all Arrears due to the Officers and Soldiers of the Army under the Command of Ge∣neral <HI>Monk,</HI> and that they shall be received into our Service, upon as good Pay and Conditions as they now enjoy.</P>

The Original of this Declaration was sent to the House of Lords, and a Duplicate in a Letter to the House of Commons, and repeated and sent in a Letter to General <HI>Monk,</HI> the Council of State, and the Officers of the Army. Hereupon it was resolved by the Parliament to prepare an Answer; and both in the House of Lords, and in the House of Commons, It was voted to proclaim King <HI>Charles</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and in <HI>London,</HI> as lawful Sovereign of his Kingdoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is proclaimed King.</NOTE> which was done on the 8th of the Month called <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>Now the King, who by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was invited to return to <HI>Brus∣sels,</HI> and by the <HI>French</HI> to come to <HI>Calais,</HI> chose, at the pressing Invita∣tion of the States General of the United Provinces to go by <HI>Holland;</HI> and so he went with the Yachts of the States to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and from thence with Coaches to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where having staid some Days, he took Shipping at <HI>Schevelighen</HI> for <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And from <HI>Holland</HI> ar∣rives in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and comes to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> on the Anniversary of his Birth∣day.</NOTE> and made his Entry at <HI>London</HI> on the Anniversary of his Birth-Day. Thus we see <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, who not long after was crown'd, restored not by the Sword, but by the marvellous Hand of the Lord.</P>
<P>About this Time <HI>George Fox</HI> the Younger came to <HI>Harwich,</HI> where he was haled out of a Meeting, and imprisoned under a Pretence of having caused a Tumult. But to give to the Reader a true Sight of the Mat∣ter, I must go back a little.</P>
<P>About four Years before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Story at large of <HI>G.F.</HI> jun. being im∣prisoned at <HI>Harwich</HI> on pretence of a tumult.</NOTE> some of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> being come into the said Town, one of them spoke a few Words by way of Exhortation to the People that came from the Steeple-house; and passing on, he and those with him went to an Inn. The Mayor hearing thereof, sent to them, commanding that they should depart the Town, which they did after a short Space; but about Night they re∣turned and lodg'd as their Inn; and the next Day passed away peace∣ably. Not long after, the Woman that kept the Inn, was commanded to come before the Magistrates, who threatned to take away her Li∣cence, unless she promised to lodge no more such Persons. But how eager soever they were for keeping out the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet it proved ineffectual; for it seems some of those that had been spoken to in the Streets, were so reached, that they came to be obedient to the inward Teachings of the Lord they had been recommended to. And so a Way was made for Meetings there, whereby the Number of those of that Society began to increase. And because they could no longer comply with superstitious Burials, they bought a Piece of Ground to bury their Dead in, but met with great Opposition at their Burials; and once, when several came along to bury a Corps, it was by Force taken from them, and set by the Sea-side, where having lain above Ground Part of two Days and one Night, it was privately covered by some with small Stones.</P>
<P>In the Month called <HI>May, G. Fox</HI> the Younger came to <HI>Harwich,</HI> to preach the Truth there. The Mayor of the Town, whose Name was <HI>Miles Hubbard,</HI> having heard of this, stopt several that were going to the Meeting. The rude Multitude seeing it, grew insolent, and made a hideous Noise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fore the House where the Meeting was kept, and some were for pulling it down. <HI>G. Fox</HI> hearing the Noise, whilst he was preaching, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew very zealous, and with a mighty Power was made to say, <HI>Wo, wo unto the Rulers and Teachers of this Nation, who suffer such Ʋngodliness as this, and do not seek to suppress it.</HI> Some that heard him thus speaking, went and told the Magistrates of it, perhaps not in the self∣same Words as were uttered by him. The Officers then coming, the Mayor commanded the Constables to take the said <HI>G. Fox</HI> into Custody; who hearing this, said, <HI>If I have done any Thing worthy of Death or Bonds, I shall not refuse either; but I desire thee to shew rac what Law I have trans∣gressed;
<PB N="238" REF="003104_0249_0FEFF5A1E8427520"/>
which thou oughtest to do before thou sendest me to Prison, that I may know for what I am sent thither.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R, Grassing∣ham</HI> gees free∣ly with <HI>G.F</HI> to the Prison.</NOTE> But the Mayor told him, <HI>He should know that afterward;</HI> and so he was carried to Prison. <HI>Robert Grassingham,</HI> who was Shipwright of the Admiralty in that Port, being at the Meeting, out of which <HI>G. Fox</HI> was haled, in Love went freely along with him to Prison. This seemed to please the Mayor, who some Days before had been heard to say concerning <HI>Grassingham, If I could but get him out of the Town, I should know what Course to take with the other</HI> Quakers. Some time after <HI>G. Fox</HI> was imprisoned, a <HI>Mittimus</HI> was sent to the Goaler, in which the Prisoner was charged with <HI>causing a Tumult in that Borough, and disturbing the Peace thereof.</HI> This <HI>Mittimus</HI> was signed by <HI>Miles Hub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard Mayor, Anthony Woolward,</HI> and <HI>Daniel Smith;</HI> and these Magistrates sent Notice of what they had done to the Parliament, under a specious Pretence, that so they might not fall into Disgrace. The Parliament receiving this Information, issued forth the following Order.</P>

<P>Ordered, That the Thanks of this House be given to the Mayor and Magistrates of <HI>Harwich</HI> for their Care in this Business.</P>

<P>By this it appeared that the Magistrates of <HI>Harwich</HI> had special Friends in the Parliament. <HI>R. Grassingham</HI> being at Liberty, was gone to <HI>London;</HI> and when this Order came to <HI>Harwich, G. Fox</HI> was deliver∣ed to the Sheriff of <HI>Essex</HI> and his Men: These went with him to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and upon the Road they met <HI>Grassingham,</HI> who was coming from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Harwich,</HI> in Pursuance of an Order which he had received from the Commissioner of the Admiralty and Navy, for resitting one of the King's Frigots. But notwithstanding <HI>Grassingham</HI> shewed his Order to the Sheriff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are both committed to the Sergeant at Arms, and write to the House of Commons..</NOTE> yet he brought him back to <HI>London</HI> with <HI>Fox,</HI> and deliver∣ed them into the Custody of the Sergeant at Arms, attending the House, who committed them to <HI>Lambeth-House.</HI> They having been there about three Weeks, wrote a Letter to the House of Commons, wherein they gave some Account of the Manner of their Imprisonment, and desired, <Q>That they with their Accusers might be brought Face to Face before the Parliament, saying, That if any thing could be proved against them, worthy of Punishment, they should not re∣fuse it. But they thought it to be unjust and unreasonable, that only one should be haled out of a peaceable Meeting, and sent to Prison, without being examined, only for declaring against the cur∣sing and the Wickedness of the rude People, and against such as suf∣fered such Ungodliness, and did not seek to suppress it.</Q></P>
<P>This was the chief Contents of their Paper, which they inclosed in a Letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons in these Words:</P>

<P>Shortly after this Order was issued forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are yet a good while de∣tained for their Fees.</NOTE> the Sergeant at Arms sent his Clerk to demand Fees and Chamber-Rent of the Prisoners, asking fifty Pounds for Fees, and ten Shillings a Week for Chamber-Rent. But since no Evil was laid to their Charge, they could not resolve to satisfy this unreasonable Demand, yet offered to pay two Shillings and Sixpence a Week, tho' the Chamber where they had lain, was the highest Room in a lofty Tower, and all the Windows open, until they had gotten them glazed, without any Charge to the Sergeant. Mat∣ters standing thus, their Cause was referred to the King's Privy Coun∣cil. But it lasted yet a good while before they were released; for several Evasions were made use of to keep them in Custody.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was Prisoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorable Exhortations to K.<HI>Ch II.</HI> by <HI>G. F.</HI></NOTE> he wrote a little Book, which he call'd <HI>A Noble Salutation to King</HI> Charles Stuart. Wherein he shewed him how Matters had gone in <HI>England,</HI> viz. <Q>That his Father's Party scorn∣ed those that appeared in Arms against them because of their Mean∣ness for they were Tradesmen, Ploughmen, Servants, and the like; which contemptible Instruments God made use of to bring down the Loftiness of the others. But those of the Parliament Party growing from Time to Time successful and prevailing, got into the Possessions of those they conquered, and fell into the same Pride and Oppression which they had cried out against in others; and many of them be∣came greater Oppressors and Persecutors than the former had been.</Q> Moreover, the Author exhorted the King to obsreve the Hand of the Lord in restoring of him. <HI>Therefore,</HI> said he, <HI>let no Man deceive thee, by persuading thee that these Things are thus brought to pass, because the
<PB N="240" REF="003104_0251_0FEFF5A5AC6E0218"/>
Kingdom was thy own proper Right, and because it was witheld from thee con∣trary to all Right; or because that those called Royalists are much more righteous than those who are now fallen under Thee. For I plainly declare unto Thee, that this Kingdom, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth are properly the Lord's.—And this know, that it was the just Hand of God, in taking away tha Kingdom from thy Father and thee, and giving it unto others; and that also it is the just Hand of the Lord to take it again from them, and bring them under Thee; tho' I shall not say, but that some of them went beyond their Commission against thy Father, when they were brought as a Rod over you; and well will it be for Thee, if Thou becomest not guilty of the same Transgressions.</HI></P>
<P>The Author farther exhorts the King to consider,<Q>That his Station was not without Danger; because of the Changeableness of the Peo∣ple, a great Part of which were perfidious, since one while they had sworn for a King and Parliament; and shortly after they swore against a King, single Person, or House of Lords; and afterwards again they swore for a single Person. Some Time after, they cry'd up a Parlia∣ment again. And when <HI>0. Cromwel</HI> had turn d out the Parliament, and set up himself, then the Priests prayed for him, and asserted his Au∣thority to be just; and when he died, they fawned upon his Son <HI>Richard,</HI> and blasphemously termed his Father <HI>the Light of their Eyes, and the Breath of their Nostrils;</HI> and they told him,<HI>that God had left him to carry on that glorious Work which his Father had begun.</HI> Nay, some Priests compared <HI>Oliver</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> to <HI>Joshua, who should carry them into the promised Land.</HI> Thus they continually would flatter those that were at the Helm. For when <HI>George Booth</HI> made a Rising, and they thought there would be a Turn, then some of the Priests cryed out against the Parliament, and cursed such as would not go out against them. But when <HI>Booth</HI> was taken, then many began to petition the Parliament, and to excuse themselves, that they had no Hand in that Rising.</Q></P>
<P>Next the Author sets forth the Wickedness of the People, <Q>by ex∣cessive Drinking, and Drunkenness; thereby, as it were, to shew their Loyalty to the King: And he relates also, how having preached at <HI>Harwich,</HI> against the grievous Wickedness of the People, he was haled to Prison in the King's Name. Finally he exhorts the King to take Heed of seeking Revenge; and to shew Mercy.</Q></P>
<P>This Paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which were delivered to the King by <HI>R. H.</HI> and afterward printed. Divers Que∣ries proposed to the Qua∣kers, suppo∣sedly by the <HI>E.</HI> of <HI>C.</HI></NOTE> which was not a small one, for it took up several Sheets, was delivered in Writing by <HI>Richard Hubberthorn,</HI> into the King's Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and was not long after by the Author given forth in Print.</P>
<P>Now one of the most eminent Royalists drew up divers Queries to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> desiring them to answer to them, and to direct their An∣swer with this Superscription, <HI>Tradite hanc Amico Regis,</HI> that is, <HI>Deliver this to the King's Friend.</HI> For it was clearly seen, that several of their Predictions came to be fulfilled, of which those of <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI> were not the least. And therefore some (as it seems) thought that by the <HI>Quakers</HI> they might get some Knowledge whether any Stability of the King's Government was to be expected. By the Queries it appeared, that the Author of them was a Man of Understanding, and of some Moderation also; and tho' I don't know who he was, yet I am not with∣out Thoughts that <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> and High Chancellor, may have been the Penman thereof. The Tendency of these Queries chiefly was to know from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> <Q>What their Judgment was concerning the King's Right to the Crown; and whether they ever did foresee his Return; and also whether they could judge that his Reign or Government should be blessed or not. Moreover, whether he might justly forgive or avenge himself? And whether he might allow Liber∣ty of Conscience to all Sorts of People,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answered by</HI> E. Burroughs.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI> answered
<PB N="241" REF="003104_0252_0FEFF562475CF2E0"/>
these Queries, and published his Answer in Print. It was directed to the King and the Royalists. In it he shewed, <Q>That in some of their Writings it had been signified, that they had some Expectations of the King's Restoration. That the King's coming to the Throne was reasonable and equitable, because thro' the Purpose of the Lord. That his Reign and Government might be blessed, or not blessed, according to his Carriage. And that he might justly forgive his and his Fa∣ther's Enemies; for tho' he and his Father might have been injured; yet forasmuch as they had applyed to the Sword to determine their Controversy with the Nation, the Sword went against them; and by that whereby they thought to stand, they did fall; and who then should they blame for that which befel them, seeing the Sword which they themselves did chuse, destroyed them. However the Author signified, that this was not meant of the King's Death, that being quite another Case. And if such, who had destroyed Kingly Go∣vernment in Name and Title, and pretended to govern better, and did not make Reformation, but became Oppressors, having broke their Promises, came to be punished on that Account with Death, or other∣wise, such could not be said to suffer for a good Conscience, nor for Righteousness Sake; but it was because they were Oppressors; and suffering for that Cause could not be called Persecution.</Q> <HI>But none of us</HI> (thus ran <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI>'s Words) <HI>can suffer for that Cause, as not being guilty thereof. If we suffer in your Government, it is for the Name of Christ, because nothing can be charged against us in this Capacity as we now stand, and in this State unto which we are now gathered and changed, nor in any Matter of Action or Rebellion against the King, nor his Father; nor in any Thing concerning the Law and Worship of our God, and the Matters of his King∣dom, and our pure Consciences. And if any that are now amongst us, were any Way engaged in the Parliament Service in the Wars, it was not in Rebellion a∣gainst the King or his Father, or that we sought their Destruction, as Men; but upon sober and reasonable Principles, and not for corrupt Ends, nor to get Ho∣nour and Riches to our selves, as some others might do, who went into the War for self Ends, and continued in Action, after the Cause which was once engaged for was utterly lost. And that Principle, which some Time led some into Action to oppose Oppression, and seek after Reformation, that Principle is still justified, tho' we are now better informed than once we were. For tho' we do now more than ever oppose Oppression, and seek after Reformation, yet we do it not in that Way of outward warring and fighting with carnal Weapons and Swords; and you ought to put a Difference between such as some Time acted in the Wars against you, in and upon sober and reasonable Principles, and that did not make themselves rich and high in the World, thro' your Sufferings, and between such as have acted against you for Sef-Ends, and have insulted over you, and have made themselves great and rich in this World thro' your Afflictions and Sufferings.</HI> To the Query, <Q>Whether the great Afflictions sustained by the King divers Years, from Subjects of his own Nation, and the Guilt thereof, did lie upon all the Subjects in general? Or whether upon any, or some particu∣lar Sorts of People, who were such more than others?</Q> <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> made this Answer, <HI>So far as his Sufferings were unjust, the Guilt thereof doth not lie upon all the Subjects in general, but upon some more than others; and such are easy to be distinguished from others, if it be considered who they are that raised the War in this Nation, against the King, and who first preached and prayed up the War, and prosecuted it against the King's Father, and who cast out the Bi∣shops and Prelates from their Places, and took their Revenues and Benefices, and are become Men as corrupted, as covetous and self-seeking, as proud and ambitious, as unjust Persecutors, as even the Men were which they cast out: And who it is that hath gotten great Estates in the Nation, and worldly Honour, and raised themselves from nothing by the Wars, and by your Suffering; and
<PB N="242" REF="003104_0253_0FEFF5A930DA06F8"/>
who got the Estates and Titles of their Enemies, and pretended to free them from all Oppressions, but have not done it, but have continued the old Op∣pressions, and have been striving among themselves who should rule, and who should be great.mdash;And as for us, who are called</HI> Quakers, <HI>we are clear from the Guilt of all the King's Sufferings. We have not cast out others, and taken their Places of great B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nefices, neither have we made War with carnal Weapons against any, never since we were a People. Neither have we broken Oaths and Engagements, nor promised Freedom and Deliverance, and for Self-Ends and earthly Riches betrayed as others, have done. And in many Particulars it doth appear, that we are clear from his Sufferings, for we have been a suffer∣ing People as well as they, by the same Spirit which caused them to suffer, which hath been much more cruel, wicked, and unjust towards us, than it hath been to∣wards them, tho' our Persecution hath been in another Manner. But what they have done against us, we can freely forgive them, and would have you to follow the same Example. For if you could accuse them in many Things, so could we: But this is not a Time to accuse one another, but to forgive one another, and so to overcome your Enemies. When they had gotten the Victory, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did not reform, but became Oppressors, as well as others, and became cruel towards others, that would not say and do as they: And for this Cause the Lord hath brought them down, and may justly suffer others to deal with them as they have dealt with others. Yet notwithstanding I must still say, and it is my Judgment, that there was very great Oppression and Vexation under the Government of the late King, and Bishops under his Power, which the Lord was offended with, and ma∣ny good People oppressed by; for which Cause the Lord might and did justly raise up some to oppose, and strive against Oppressions and Injustice, and to press after Reformation in all Things. This Principle of Sincerity, which in some Things carried them on in opposing Oppressions, and pressing after Reformation, I can never deny, but acknowledge it; tho' many have lost it, and became Self-Seekers, for∣getting the Cause pretended to,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is but a small Part of the Queries and the Answers thereunto, which <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> concluded with a bold Exhortation to the King, to fear and reverence the Lord.</P>
<P>Now we return again to <HI>G. Fox</HI> the Elder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> sen. goes to <HI>Glo∣cester, Wor∣cester, Dray∣ton</HI> and <HI>York∣shire,</HI> and has a Meeting at <HI>Balby,</HI> where some Thou∣sands are pre∣sent. A Troop of Horse comes from <HI>York</HI> to disperse them, but the Capt. tho' a despe∣rate Man, gives them but little Di∣sturbance.</NOTE> whom we left about <HI>Bristol;</HI> from whence he past to <HI>Glocester, Worcester, Drayton,</HI> (the Place of his Nativity) and <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> In that Country, at that Time, a year∣ly Meeting was kept at <HI>Balby,</HI> in an Orchard, where some Thousands of People were met together. At <HI>York,</HI> about thirty Miles off, No∣tice being given of this Meeting, a Troop of Horse came from thence; and when <HI>G. Fox</HI> stood preaching in the Meeting on the Stool, two Trumpeters came riding up, sounding their Trumpets pretty near him: And then the Captain bid him, <HI>Come down, for he was come,</HI> he said,<HI>to disperse the Meeting. G. Fox,</HI> then speaking told him,<HI>He knew they were peaceable People:</HI> <Q>But if he did question that they met in an hostile Manner, he might make Search among them; and if he found ei∣ther Sword or Pistol about any there, such might suffer:</Q> But the Captain told <HI>G. Fox, He must see them dispersed, for he came all Night oh purpose to disperse them. G. Fox</HI> ask'd him, <Q>What Honour it would be to him to ride with Swords and Pistols amongst so many unarmed Men and Women; But if he would be still and quiet, the Meeting probably might not continue above two or three Hours: And when it was done, as they came peaceably, so they should part: For he might perceive, the Meeting was so large, that all the Country thereabouts could not entertain them, but that they intended to de∣part towards their Homes at Night.</Q> But the Captain said, <HI>He could, not stay so long. G. Fox</HI> desired then, that if he himself could not stay to see the Meeting ended, he would let a Dozen of his Soldiers stay. To this the Captain said, <HI>He would permit them an Hour's Time;</HI> so he
<PB N="243" REF="003104_0254_0FEFF56543C2D848"/>
left six Soldiers to stay there, and then went away with his Troop: He being gone, the Soldiers that were left, told those that were met together, <HI>They might stay till Night, if they would.</HI> This they were not for, but parted about three Hours after, without any Disturbance. But if the Soldiers had been of such a Temper as their Captain, per∣haps the Meeting should not have ended thus quietly: For he was a desperate Man, having once told <HI>G. Fox</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> That <HI>he would obey his Superior s Command; and if it were to crucify Christ,</HI> he would do it; or <HI>execute the great Turk's Commands against the Christians, if he were under him.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Skipton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> is at a general Meeting at <HI>Skipton,</HI> which when Officers came to disturb, and saw their Ac∣counts of Col∣lections, and Care for the Poor, they commend their Practice and kindly leave them.</NOTE> where there was a general Meeting concerning the Affairs of the Church. For many of his Friends suf∣fered much, and their Goods being taken from them, and some brought to Poverty, there was a Necessity to provide for them. This Meeting had stood several Years; for when the Justices and Captains came to break it up, and saw the Books and Accounts of Collections for Relief of the Poor, and how Care was taken that one County should help ano∣ther, and provide for the Poor, they commended such Practice, and pass'd away in Love. Sometimes there would come two Hundred poor People belonging to other Societies, and wait there till the Meeting was done; and then the Friends would send to the Bakers for Bread, and give every one of those poor People a Loaf, how many soever there were▪ For they were taught to <HI>do good unto all,</HI> tho' <HI>especially to the Houshold of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>From hence <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Lancaster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> is ta∣ken from <HI>M.

Next Morning he was carried to <HI>Lan∣caster,</HI> but exceedingly abused by the Way; and being come to Town was brought to the House of a Justice, whose Name was <HI>Hen∣ry Porter,</HI> and who had granted the Warrant against him. He ask'd <HI>Porter, For what, and by whose Order he sent forth his Warrant?</HI> And he complained to him of the Abuse of the Constables and other Officers: for they had set him upon a Horse behind the Saddle, so that he had nothing to hold by; and maliciously beating the Horse, made him kick and gallop, and throw off his Rider. But <HI>Porter</HI> would not take any Notice of that, and told <HI>G. Fox, he had an Order, but would not let him see it; for he would not reveal the King's Secrets.</HI> After many Words were exchanged, he was carried to <HI>Lancaster</HI> Prison. Being there a close Prisoner in the common Jail, he desired two of his Friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of which was <HI>Thomas Green,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T.

And that he, to∣gether with others of his fanatick Opinion had of late endeavoured to raise Insu∣rections in these Parts of the Country, and to embroil the whole Kingdom in Blood.

And if the Lord hath shewed thee Mercy, and forgiven thee, and thou dost not shew Mercy, and forgive, the Lord God will not hear thy Prayers, not them that pray for thee: And if thou do not stop Persecution, and Persecutors, and take away all Laws that do hold up Persecution about Religion; but if thou do persist in them, and uphold Persecution, that will make thee as blind as them that have gone before thee: For Perse∣cution hath always blinded those that have gone into it; and such, God by his Power overthrows, and doth his valiant Acts upon, and bringeth Salvation to his oppressed ones: And if thou dost bear the Sword in vain, and let Drunkenness, Oaths, Plays, May-games, (with Fidlers, Drums, Trumpets to play at them) with such like Abominations and Vanities be encouraged, or go unpunished; as set∣ting up of May-poles, with the Image of the Crown a top of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Nations will quickly turn like <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and be as bad as the old World, who grieved the Lord till he overthrew them: And so he will you, if these Things be not suddenly prevented. Hardly was there so much Wickedness at Liberty before now, as there is now at this Day; as tho' there was no Terror, nor Sword of Magistracy; which doth not grace a Government, nor is a Praise to them that do well. Our Prayers are for them that are in Au∣thority, that under them we may live a godly Life, in which we have Peace; and that we may not be brought into Ungodliness by them. So hear, and consider, and do good in thy Time, whilst thou hast Power; and be merciful, and forgive, that is the Way to overcome, and obtain the Kingdom of Christ.</P>

<P>The Sheriff of <HI>Lancaster</HI> still refused to remove <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is still de∣tained.</NOTE> unless he would become bound, and pay for the Sealing of the Writing, and the Charge of carrying him up. But this he would not. Then they consulting how to convey him; it was at first proposed to send a Party of Horse with him: But he told them, <HI>If he were such a Man as they had re∣presented him to be, they had need to send a Troop or two of Horse to guard him.</HI> But considering that this would be a great Charge to them, they concluded to send him up guarded only by the Jailor and some Bai∣liffs. On farther Consideration they found that this also would be very chargeable; and thereupon told him, <HI>If he would put in Bail, that he would be in</HI> London <HI>such a Day of the Term, he should have Leave to go up with some of his own Friends. G. Fox</HI> told them, <HI>He would neither put in any Bail, nor give any Money: But if they would let him go up with one or two of his Friends, he would go up, and be in</HI> London <HI>such a Day,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And at last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> permitted to come to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> in Com∣pany of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pear before the Judges.</NOTE> <HI>if the Lord did permit.</HI> So at last, when they saw they could not make him bow, the Sheriff consented, that he should go up with some of his Friends, without any other Engagement than his Word, <HI>To appear before the Judges at</HI> London <HI>such a Day of the Term, if the Lord did per∣mit.</HI> Whereupon they let him go out of Prison; and after some Stay, he went with <HI>Richard Hubberthorn</HI> and <HI>Robert Withers</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> whither
<PB N="246" REF="003104_0257_0FEFF5ADA33CD020"/>
he came on a Day that some of the Judges of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1st were hanged and quarter'd at <HI>Charing-Cross;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which he per∣forms accord∣ingly, being accompanied by — <HI>Marsh,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the King's Bedchamber, and is exa∣mined by the Judges.</NOTE> for now what <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> and others had plainly foretold, was fulfilling on them.</P>
<P>The next Morning <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and those with him, went to Judge <HI>Tho∣mas Mallet</HI>'s Chamber, who then was putting on his red Gown, to sit upon some more of the King's Judges, and therefore told him, <HI>He might come another Time. G. Fox</HI> did so, being accompanied by — <HI>Marsh,</HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the King's Bed-Chamber. When he came to the Judge's Cham∣ber, he found there also the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Foster,</HI> and delivered to them the Charge that was against him: But when they read those Words, <HI>That he and his Friends were embroiling the Nation in Blood,</HI> &amp;c. they struck their Hands on the Table: Whereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them That <HI>he was the Man whom that Charge was against; but that he was as in∣nocent of any such Thing, as a new born Child; and that he brought it up him∣self, and that some of his Friends came up with him, without any Guard.</HI> As yet the Judges had not minded <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Hat; but now seeing his Hat on, they said, <HI>Why did he stand with his Hat on?</HI> He told them, <HI>He did not stand so in any Contempt to them.</HI> Then they commanded one to take it off; and having called for the Marshal of the King's Bench, they said to him, <HI>You must take this Man and secure him, but you must let him have a Chamber, and not put him amongst the Prisoners.</HI> But the Marshal said, <HI>His House was so full, that he could not tell where to provide a Room for him, but amongst the Prisoners.</HI> Judge <HI>Foster</HI> then said to <HI>G. Fox, Will you appear to morrow about ten of the Clock at the King's Bench Bar in</HI> Westminster-Hall? <HI>Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>If the Lord give me Strength.</HI> Hereupon the said Judge said to the other Judge, <HI>If he say</HI> Yes, <HI>and promises it, you may take his Word.</HI> So he was dismiss'd for that Time, and the next Day appeared at the King's Bench Bar at the Hour appointed, being ac∣companied by <HI>Richard Hubberthorn, Robert Withers,</HI> and <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Marsh,</HI> before named. And being brought into the middle of the Court, he look'd about, and turning to the People, said, <HI>Peace be among you.</HI> Then the Charge against him was read, and coming to that Part which said, <HI>That he and his Friends were embroiling the Nation in Blood, and raising a new War, and that he was an Enemy to the King,</HI> &amp;c. those of the Bench listed up their Hands. He then stretching out his Arms, said, <HI>I am the Man whom that Charge is against; but I am as innocent as a Child concerning the Charge, and have never learned any War-postures. Do ye think, that if I and my Friends had been such Men as the Charge declares, that I would have brought it up my self against myself? Or that I should have been suffered to come up with only one or two my Friends with me? For had I been such a Man as this Charge sets forth, I had need to have been guarded up with a Troop or two of Horse: But the Sheriff and Magistrates of</HI> Lancashire <HI>had thought fit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t me and my Friends come up by our selves, almost two hundred Miles, without any Guard at all, which we may be sure they would not have done, if they had look∣ed upon me to be such a Man.</HI> Then the Judge asked him, <HI>Whether it should be filed, or what he would do with it?</HI> And he answer'd, <HI>Ye are Judges, and able, I hope, to judge in this Matter; therefore do with it what ye will.</HI> The Judges said, <HI>They did not accuse him, for they had nothing against him.</HI> Whereupon <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Marsh</HI> stood up and told the Judges, <HI>It was the King's Pleasure that</HI> G. Fox <HI>should be set at Liberty, seeing no Accuser came up against him.</HI> Then they asked him, <HI>Whether he would put it to the King and Coun∣cil?</HI> He answer'd, <HI>Yes, with a good Will.</HI> Thereupon they sent the She∣riff's Return, which he made to the Writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> to the King, and this Return was thus:</P>

<SP>
<PB N="248" REF="003104_0259_0FEFF5AFEB6F4B10"/>
<P>Since the Lord hath called us, and gathered us to be a People, to walk in his Fear, and in his Truth, we have always suffered and been persecutcd by the Powers that have ruled, and been made a Prey of, for departing from Iniquity; and when the Breach of no just Law could be charged aguinst us, then they made Laws on Purpose to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsnare us; and so our Sufferings were unjustly continued.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>It is true, those that have ruled over you, have been cruel, and have professed much which they have not done.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>And likewise the same Sufferings do now abound in more Cruelty against us in many Parts of this Nation: As for Instance, one at <HI>Thetford</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> where <HI>Henry Fell,</HI> ministring unto the Peo∣ple, was taken out of the Meeting, and whipp'd, and sent out of the Town, from Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Parish, towards <HI>Lancashire;</HI> and the chief Ground of his Accusation in his Pass (which was shewn to the King) was because he denied to take the Oath of Allegiance and Su∣premacy; and so because that for Conscience-sake we cannot swear, but have learned Obedience to the Doctrine of Christ, which saith, <HI>Swear not at all;</HI> hereby an Occasion is taken against us, to persecute us; and it is well known, that we have not sworn for any, nor against any, but have kept to the Truth, and our Yea hath been Yea, and our Nay, Nay, in all Things, which is more than the Oath or those that are out of the Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King. </SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But why can you not swear? for an Oath is a common Thing amongst Men to any Engagement.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>Yes it is manifest, and we have seen it by Experience; and it is so common amongst Men to swear and engage either for, or against Things, that there is no Regard taken to them, nor Fear of an Oath; that therefore which we speak of in the Truth of our Hearts, is more than what they swear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King. </SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But can you not promise as before the Lord (which is the Substance of the Oath?)</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, what we do affirm, we can promise before the Lord, and take him to our Witness in it; but our so promising hath not been accepted, but the Ceremony of an Oath they have stood for, without which all other Things were accounted of no Effect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But how may we know from your Words that you will perform?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>By proving of us; for they that swear, are not known to be faithful, but by proving of them; and so we, by those that have tried us, are found to be truer in our Promises, than others by their Oaths; and to those that do yet prove us, we shall appear the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Pray what is your Principle?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>Our Principle is this, That <HI>Jesus Christ is the true Light which enlightneth every one that cometh into the World, that all Men thro' him might believe;</HI> and that they were to obey and follow this Light, as they have received it, whereby they may be led unto God, and unto Righteousness, and the Knowledge of the Truth, that they may be saved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King. </SPEAKER>
<P><HI>This do all Christians confess to be Truth? and he is not a Christian that will deny it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>But many have denied it both in Words and Writings, and opposed us in it; and above an Hundred Books are put forth in Op∣position unto this Principle.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then some of the Lords standing by the King, said, that none would deny that every one is enlightned.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>And one of the Lords asked, <HI>How long we had been called</HI> Quakers, <HI>or did we own that Name?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="249" REF="003104_0260_0FEFF56CC6761D20"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>That Name was given to us in Scorn and Derision about twelve Years since; but there were some that lived in this Truth be∣fore we had that Name given unto us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How long is it since you owned this Judgment and Way?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is near twelve Years since I owned this Truth according to the Manifestation of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Do you own the Sacrament?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for the Word <HI>Sacrament,</HI> I do not read of it in the Scrip∣ture; but as for the Body and Blood of Christ, I own, that there is no Remission without Blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King. </SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well that is it: But do you not believe that every one is commanded to receive it?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>This we do believe, That according as it is written in the Scripture, that Christ at his last Supper took Bread and brake it, and gave to his Disciples, and also took the Cup and blessed it, and said unto them, <HI>And as often as ye do this,</HI> (that is, as often as they brake Bread) <HI>you shew forth the Lord's Death till he come;</HI> and this we believe they did; <HI>and they did eat their Bread in Singleness of Heart from House to House:</HI> and Christ did come again to them, according to his Promise; after which they said, <HI>We being many, are one Bread, for we are all Par∣takers of this one Bread.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King's Friend. </SPEAKER>
<P>Then one of the King's Friends said, <HI>It is true; for as many Grains make one Bread so they being many Members, were one Body.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Another of them said, <HI>If they be the Bread, then they must be broken.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>There is Difference between that Bread which he brake at his last Supper, wherein they were to shew forth, as in a Sign, his Death until he came; and this whereof they spake, they being ma∣ny, are one Bread; for herein they were come more into the Sub∣stance, and to speak more mystically, as they knew it in the Spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King's Friends. </SPEAKER>
<P>Then they said, <HI>It is true, and he hath spoken nothing but Truth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How know you that you are inspired by the Lord?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>According as we read in the Scriptures, That <HI>the Inspiration of the Almighty giveth Ʋnderstanding;</HI> so by his Inspiration is an Under∣standing given us of the Things of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then one of the Lords said, <HI>How do you know that you are led by the true Spirit?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>This we know, because the Spirit of Truth it reproves the World of Sin, and by it we were reproved of Sin, and also are led from Sin unto Righteousness, and Obedience of Truth, by which Ef∣fects we know it is the true Spirit; for the Spirit of the wicked One doth not lead into such Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King and Lords.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the King and his Lords said, <HI>It was Truth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King. </SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, of this you may be assured, That you shall none of you suffer for your Opinions or Religion, so long as you live peaceably, and you have the Word of a King for it; and I have also given forth a Declaration to the same purpose, that none should wrong you, nor abuse you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How do you own Magistrates, or Magistracy?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>Thus we do own Magistrates: Whosoever is set up by God, <HI>whether King as supreme.</HI> or any set in Authority by him, who are <HI>for the Punistment of Evil-doers, and the praise of them that do well,</HI> such we shall submit unto, and assist in righteous and civil Things, both by Body and Estate: And if any Magistrates do that which is unrigh∣teous, we must declare against it; only submit under it by a patient Suf∣fering, and not rebel against any by Insurrections, Plots, and Contri∣vances.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="250" REF="003104_0261_0FEFF5B238075E58"/>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then one of the Lords asked, <HI>Why do you meet together, see∣ing every one of you have the Church in your selves?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>According as it is written in the Scriptures, the Church is in God, Thes. i. 1. <HI>And they that feared the Lord, did meet often together in the Fear of the Lord,</HI> and to us it is profitable, and herein we are edifie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and strengthned in the Life of Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How did you first come to believe the Scriptures were Truth?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>I have believed the Scriptures from a Child to be a Decla∣ration of Truth, when I had but a literal Knowledge, natural Edu∣cation and Tradition; but now I know the Scriptures to be true by the Manifestation and Operation of the Spirit of God fulfilling them in me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>In what Manner do you meet, and what is the Order in your Meet∣ings?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>We do meet in the same Order as the People of God did, waiting upon him; and if any have a Word of Exhortation from the Lord, he may speak it; or if any have a Word of Reproof or Admonition, and as every one hath received the Gift, so they may minister one unto another, and may be edified one by another, whereby a Growth into the Knowledge of the Truth is administred to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>One of the Lords. </SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Then you know not so much as you may know, but there is a Growth then to be admitted of?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>R. H.</HI> </SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we do grow daily into the Knowledge of the Truth, in our Exercise and Obedience to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Are any of your Friends gone to</HI> Rome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is one in Prison in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why did you send him thither?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did not send him thither, but he found something upon his Spirit from the Lord, whereby he was called to go and declare against Superstition and Idolatry, which is contrary to the Will of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King's Friend said.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>There were two of them at</HI> Rome, <HI>but one was dead.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Have any of your Friends been with the Great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urk?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of our Friends have been in that Country.</P>
</SP>
<P>Other things were spoken concerning the Liberty of the Servants of the Lord, who were called of him into his Service, that to them there was no Limitation to Parishes or Places, but as the Lord did guide them in his Work and Service by his Spirit.</P>
<P>So the King promised that we should not any ways suffer for our Opinion or Religion; and so in Love passed away.</P>
<P>The King having promised <HI>Richard Hubberthorn</HI> over and again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who promises on his Word, Friends should not suffer for their Opinion.</NOTE> that his Friends should not suffer for their Opinion or Religion, they parted in Love.

have told,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rome, where <HI>Love</HI> dies in Prison, and <HI>Parrot</HI> after∣wards turns Apostate.</NOTE> that he was dispatch'd in the Night, for fear he should annoy the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> However it was, he died in Sincerity of Heart, and so was more happy than <HI>Parrot,</HI> who tho' then perhaps he was in a pretty good Frame of Mind, yet he afterwards turn'd an eminent Apostate, having continued Prisoner at <HI>Rome</HI> a great while, and at length got his Liberty: He was a Man of great natural Parts, but not continuing in true Humility, ran out into exorbitant Imagina∣tions, of which more may be said hereafter. About this Time, <HI>Sam∣uel Fisher</HI> and <HI>John Stubbs</HI> were also at <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. Fisher</HI> and <HI>J. Stubs</HI> spread Books at Rome, and return unmo∣lested.</NOTE> where they spoke with some of the Cardinals, and testifyed against the Popish Superstition. They also spread some Books amongst the Fryers, some of whom confessed the Contents thereof to be Truth: But said they, if we should acknowledge this publickly, we might expect to be burnt for it. Notwithstanding <HI>Fisher</HI> and <HI>Stubbs</HI> went free, and returned unmolested.</P>
<P>The Case of <HI>Mary Fisher,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M. Fisher</HI> comes to <HI>Smirna,</HI> from whence she is sent back to <HI>Venice;</HI> thence she goes to Sultan <HI>Ma∣homet</HI>'s Camp near <HI>Adria∣nople,</HI> sends to the Visier, who procures Admittance to the Sultan, who favoura∣bly receives her Message, offers her a Guard, and dismisses her with Respect: She then goes to <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> and re∣turns safe to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> a Maiden, and one of the first <HI>Quakers</HI> (so called) that came into <HI>New-England</HI> (as hath been mentioned before) I can't pass by in Silence. She being come to <HI>Smirna,</HI> to go from thence to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> was stopt by the <HI>English</HI> Consul, and sent back to <HI>Venice,</HI> from whence she came by another Way to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> at the Time that Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> the IVth, was encamped with his Army near the said Town. She went alone to the Camp, and got some body to go to the Tent of the Grand Visier, to tell him that an <HI>English</HI> Woman was come, who had something to declare from the great God to the Sultan. The Visier sent word, that next Morning he should procure her an Opportunity for that Purpose. Then she returned to the Town, and repaired next Morning to the Camp again: Where being come, she was brought before the Sultan, who had his great Men about him, in such a Manner as he was used to admit Ambassadors. He ask'd her by his Interpreters (whereof there were three with him) <HI>Whether it was true what had been told him, That she had something to say to him from the Lord God?</HI> She an∣swered, <HI>Yea.</HI> Then he bad her speak on: And she not being forward, weightily pondering what she might say, and he supposing that she might be fearful to utter her Mind before them all, asked her, <HI>Whe∣ther she desired that any might go aside, before she spoke?</HI> She answered <HI>No.</HI> He then bad her <HI>Speak the Word of the Lord to them and not to fear, for they had good Hearts and could hear it.</HI> He also charged her, to <HI>speak the Word she had to say from the Lord, neither more nor less, for they were willing to hear it, be it what it would.</HI> Then she spoke what she had upon her Mind.</P>
<P>The Turks hearkened to her with much Attention and Gravity, till she had done, and then the Sultan asking her, <HI>Whether she had any thing more to say?</HI> She ask'd him, <HI>Whether he understood what she said?</HI> And he an∣swered, <HI>Yes, every Word;</HI> and farther said, <HI>That what she had spoken was Truth.</HI> Then he desired her to stay in that Country, saying, <HI>That they could not but respect such an one, as should take so much pains to come to them so far as from</HI> England, <HI>with a Message from the Lord God.</HI> He also proferred her a Guard to bring her into <HI>Constantinople</HI> whither she inten∣ded. But she not accepting this Offer, he told her, <HI>it was dangerous travelling, especially for such an one as she; and wondred that she had passed so safe, so far as she had:</HI> saying also, <HI>It was in Respect to her, and Kindness that he prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rred it, and that he would not for any Thing she should come to the leas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt in his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inions.</HI> She having no more to say, the Turks asked her, <HI>What she thought of their Prophet</HI> Mahomet? She answered warily; <HI>That she knew him not; but Christ, the true Prophet, the Son of God, who was the Light of the World, and enlightened every Man coming into the World, him she kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w.</HI> And c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erning <HI>Mahomet</HI> she said, <HI>that they might judge of him to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cording to the Words, and Prophecies he spoke;</HI> saying

farther, <HI>If the Word that a Prophet speaketh, come to pass, then shall ye know, that the Lord hath sent that Prophet; but if it come not to pass, then shall ye know that the Lord never sent him.</HI> The Turks confessed this to be true; and <HI>Mary</HI> having performed her Message, departed from the Camp to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> without a Guard, whither she came without the least Hurt or Scoff. And so she returned safe to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Katherine Evans</HI> and <HI>Sarah Chivers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A short Hint concerning <HI>K. Evans</HI> and <HI>S. Chevers.</HI></NOTE> two Women, who at this Time lay in the Prison of the Inquisition at <HI>Malta,</HI> and were not released, till after three Years Confinement, where they suffered most grievous Hardships; I intend to speak hereafter, when I am come to the Time of their Deliverance; and then I purpose to make a large, and very remarkable Description concerning it.</P>
<P>In the mean while I return to the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affairs in</HI> England.</NOTE> where the Government now was quite altered. Many of the late King's Judges were now hanged and quartered: Among those was also Colonel <HI>Fran∣cis Hacker,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. <HI>Hacker</HI> is executed for Treason: A little before his Death he owns Trouble for what he had done to the Innocent.</NOTE> of whom about six Years before this Time, it hath been said, that he took <HI>George Fox</HI> Prisoner. But he now himself was in Prison, and impeached not only as one of those that kept the King Prisoner, but also that he signed the Warrant for the King's Execution, and had conducted him to the Scaffold. To all which and more, he said little, but that what he did, was by Order of his Superiors; and that he had endeavoured to serve his Country. But this did not a∣vail him, for he was condemned for high Treason, and hang'd and quartered in <HI>October.</HI> A Day or two before his Death, <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> visited him in Prison; and when he was put in Mind of what former∣ly he had done against the Innocent, he remembered it, and said, <HI>He knew well whom she meant, and had Trouble upon him for it.</HI> For <HI>G. F.</HI> (who had compared him to <HI>Pilate</HI>) bad him, <HI>When the Day of his Misery and Trial should come upon him, to remember what he said to him.</HI> And as <HI>Hacker</HI>'s Son in Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wicked say∣ing of <HI>Hack∣er</HI>'s Son <HI>Needham.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Needham,</HI> did not stick to say, <HI>That it was Time to have</HI> G. Fox <HI>cut off:</HI> So it came to be the Lot of <HI>Hacker</HI> himself to be cut off at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> where he was hang'd. Such now was the End of many, who were not only guilty of the King's Death, and the putting to Death of others who were for King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, but had also transgressed against God, by persecuting godly People. They had been often warned, and several Times told that God would hear the Cries of the Widows and Fatherless,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And hears the Oppressed, and Distress is brought on the Persecutors.</NOTE> that had been cruelly oppress'd by them: And as they had made Spoil of the Goods of those whom in Scorn they called <HI>Quakers,</HI> so now Fear and Quaking was brought upon them, and their Estates became a Spoil to others. How plainly <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> had foretold this, hath been said before; and not to mention others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Hunting∣ton</HI>'s remark∣able Passage to the <HI>Presbyte∣rians</HI> and <HI>In∣dependents.</HI></NOTE> I'll only say, that one <HI>Robert Huntington</HI> came once into the Steeple-house at <HI>Brough</HI> near <HI>Carlisle,</HI> with a white Sheet about him, and a Halter about his Neck, to shew the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and <HI>Independents</HI> there, that the Surplice was to be introduc'd again, and that some of them should not escape the Halter. Now how mad soever this was said to be, yet Time shew'd it a Presage of the impending Disaster of the cruel Persecutors: For when King <HI>Charles</HI> had ascended the Throne, his most fierce Enemies were dispatched out of the Way. The Parliament sitting at this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quakers</HI> heard before the H. of Lords with Moderation. The Kings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets about 700 of them at Liber∣ty who had been impri∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n'd under</NOTE> some of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were admitted to appear in the House of Lords, where they gave Reasons why they could not frequent the publick Worship, nor swear, nor pay Tithes; and they were heard with Moderation. The King also about this Time shew'd himself moderate; for being sollicited by some, and more especially by <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> he set at Liberty about seven Hundred of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who had been imprisoned under the Go∣vernment of <HI>Oliver</HI> and <HI>Richard Cromwel.</HI> This pass'd the easier, because
<PB N="253" REF="003104_0264_0FEFF57198FA7860"/>
those that were now at the <HI>Helm,</HI> had also suffered under the former Government:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>.</HI> and <HI>R. Cromwel,</HI> and an order is drawn up to permit them the Exercise of their Worship.</NOTE> There seemed likewise some Inclination to give Liberty of Conscience: But there being among those that were now in Autho∣rity, some also of a malicious Temper, they always found Means to hinder this good Work; and it just now fell out so that something started up, which put a Stop to the giving such a Liberty as aforesaid; tho' it was advanced so far that an Order was drawn up for permit∣ting the <HI>Quakers</HI> the free Exercise of their Worship; only the signing and Seal to it was wanting, when all on a sudden the Fifth Monar∣chy-men made an Insurrection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection of the Fifth Mo∣narchy-Men.</NOTE> There was at this Time a great Num∣ber of this turbulent People in <HI>England:</HI> Who perceiving that their ex∣orbitant Opinion was inconsistent with Kingly Government, which now had taken Place, thought it not meet for their Cause to sit still while the Government, which as yet was but new, should be fully settled and established. Perhaps they had also some Intent to free some of the late King's Judges, who were imprisoned; for among these was also Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> who having been one of the chief of the Common-wealth-party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>H. Vane</HI> in Prison.</NOTE> was likewise said to be one of the Heads of the Fifth-Monarchy Men. It was in the Night when these People made a Rising; which caused such a Stir, that the King's Soldiers sounded an Alarm by the beating of Drums. The Train'd-bands appeared in Arms, and all was as in an Uproar, and both the Mob and Soldiers committed great In∣solences, for several Days; so that the <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' altogether innocent, became the Object of the Fury of their Enemies, and many were haled to Prison out of their peaceable Meetings.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> seiz'd on at his Lodg∣ings, to whom —<HI>Marsh</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> shows extraor∣dinary Respect and Love, and at last gets him discharg∣ed.</NOTE> At that Time, <HI>George Fox</HI> was at <HI>London,</HI> and being lodg'd in the <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> at Night a Company of Troopers came, and knock'd at the Door where he was, which being opened, they rushed into the House, and laid hold on him. One of these, that had formerly served under the Parliament, clapp'd his Hand to <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Pocket, and asked, <HI>Whether he had any Pistol? G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>He knew he did not use to carry Pistols, why then did he ask such a Question of him, whom he knew to be a peaceable Man?</HI> Others of these Fellows ran up into the Chambers, and there found Esquire <HI>Marsh,</HI> before mentio∣ned, in Bed, who, tho' he was one of the King's Bed-chamber, yet out of Love to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> came and lodged where he did. When the Troopers came down again, they said, <HI>Why should we take this Man away with us? We will let him alone. Oh,</HI> said the Parliament-Soldier, <HI>He is one of the Heads, and a chief Ring-leader.</HI> Upon this, the Soldiers were taking him away. But Esquire <HI>Marsh</HI> hearing of it, sent for him that commanded the Party, and desi∣red him to let <HI>G. Fox</HI> alone, since he would see him forth coming in the Morning, and then they might take him. Early in the Morning there came a Company of Foot to the House; and one of them drawing his Sword, held it over <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Head, which made him ask, <HI>Wherefore he drew his Sword at a naked Man?</HI> At which his Fellows being ashamed, bid him put up his Sword; and some Time after they brought him to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> before the Troopers came for him. As he was going out, he saw several of his Friends going to the Meeting, it being then the first Day of the Week; and he intended to have gone thither himself, if he had not been stopp'd; but now it being out of his Power to keep them Company, he commended their Boldness, and encouraged them to per∣severe therein. When he was come to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> seeing the Soldiers and People were exceeding rude, he began to exhort them to Godli∣ness. But some great Persons coming by, who were envious to him, said, <HI>What, do ye let him preach? Put him into such a Place, where he may not stir.</HI> So he was put into that Place, and the Soldiers watched over him: But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them, <HI>Tho' they could confine his Body, and shut that up, yet the Word of Life they could not stop.</HI> Some then asked him, <HI>What
<PB N="254" REF="003104_0265_0FEFF5B6698A75E0"/>was?</HI> He told them, <HI>He was a Preacher of Righteousness.</HI> After he had been kept there two or three Hours, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Marsh</HI> spoke to the Lord <HI>Ge∣rard,</HI> who came, and bid them set <HI>G. Fox</HI> at Liberty. When he was discharged, the Marshal demanded Fees, <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>He could not give him any:</HI> And he asked him, <HI>How he could demand Fees of him who was innocent?</HI> Nevertheless he told him, that <HI>in his own Freedom he would give them two Pence, to make him and the Soldiers drink.</HI> But they shout∣ed at that, which made him say, <HI>If they would not accept it, they might choose; for he should not give them Fees.</HI> Then he went thro' the Guards, and came to an Inn, where several of his Freinds at that Time were Prisoners under a Guard, and about Night he went to the House of one of his Friends.</P>
<P>This Insurrection of the Fifth Monarchy-men caused a great Disturb∣ance in the Nation;<NOTE>On Occasion of the said In∣surrection Friends suffer much thro' the Nation, and <HI>T. Pachyn</HI> being dragg'd out of Bed in a Fever, dies in a Prison, and several Thousands are imprisoned, of which <HI>M. Fell</HI> gives the King an Account. <HI>G. F.</HI> writes to consolate the Sufferers, and prints a Declaration against Sedi∣ction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was pre∣sented to the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Fifth Mo∣narchy-men clear the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> of any knowledge of their Plot, and the King sets them at Liber∣ty without pay∣ing Fees. Many <HI>Presby∣terian</HI> Preach∣ers conform, on which some of their Hear∣ers joyn with the <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> and tho' the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not at all meddle with those boisterous People, yet they fell under great Sufferings because of them; and both Men and Women were dragged out of their Houses to Prison, and some sick Men off their Beds by the Legs; among which was one <HI>Thomas Pachyn,</HI> who being in a Fever, was dragged by the Soldiers out of his Bed to Prison, where he died.</P>
<P>This Persecution going on throughout the Nation, <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> went to the King, and gave him an Account how her Friends, that were no wise concerned in the said Insurrection and Riots, were treated; for several Thousands of them were cast into Prison. The King and Coun∣cil wondred how they could have such Intelligence, since strict Charge was given for the Intercepting of all Letters, so that none could pass unsearched. But notwithstanding this, so much was heard of the Numbers of the Imprisoned, that <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> went a second Time to the King and Council, and acquainted them of the grievous Sufferings of Her Friends. <HI>G. Fox</HI> then writ a Letter of Consolation to his Suf∣fering Friends; and also published in print a Declaration against all Sedition, Plotters and Fighters, wherein he manifested, that they were an harmless People, that denied Wars and Fightings, and could not make use of the outward Sword, or other carnal Weapons. This Declaration was presented to the King and his Council and was of such Effect, that the King gave forth a Proclamation, <HI>That no Soldiers should go to search any House but with a Constable.</HI> When afterwards some of the Fifth Monarchy-men were put to Death because of their Insur∣rection, they did the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, that Right, that they clear'd them openly from having an Hand in, or Knowledge of their Plot. This and other Evidences caused the King, being continually impor∣tuned thereunto, to issue forth a Declaration, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>should be set at Liberty without paying Fees.</HI> Many of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Preachers now temporized, and for keeping their Benefices, join'd with the Episcopalians; and did not stick to put on the Surplice. But this gave Occasion to many of their Hearers to leave them, and join with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, who could not comply with the Times. Others, who were a little more stedfast, made use of their Money to get Li∣berty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Others pur∣chase their Li∣berty, who in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s time would permit none.</NOTE> tho' under the Government of <HI>Cromwel</HI> they would permit no Liberty of Conscience to others; insomuch that one <HI>Hewes,</HI> an emi∣nent Priest at <HI>Plymouth in Oliver</HI>'s Days, when some Liberty was granted, pray'd <HI>That God would put it into the Hearts of the chief Magistrates of the Nation, to remove this cursed Toleration.</HI> But this <HI>Hewes,</HI> after the King was come in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And one <HI>Hewes</HI> who before had called Tolera∣tion cursed, knew not what to say now.</NOTE> being ask'd by one, <HI>Whether he would account Toleration ac∣cursed now,</HI> answered only by the Shaking of his Head.</P>
<P>Now tho' many of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as hath been said, were released from Prison, yet they suffer'd exceedingly in their Religious Assem∣blies. Once a Company of <HI>Irishmen</HI> came to the <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> when <HI>G. Fox</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="003104_0266_0FEFF57400E45CF0"/>
was there; but the Meeting was already broke up; and he being gone up into a Chamber, heard one of those rude Persons, who was a Co∣lonel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Pall Mall</HI> a desperate <HI>Irish</HI> Colonel calm'd by <HI>G. Fox.</HI></NOTE> to say, <HI>He would kill all the</HI> Quakers. Whereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> came down, and told him, <HI>The Law said, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; but thou threatnest to kill all the</HI> Quakers, <HI>tho' they have done thee no Hurt:</HI> But said he farther, <HI>Here is Gospel for thee: Here's my Hair, here's my Cheek, and here's my Shoulder,</HI> turning it to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws made against Pa∣pists are exe∣cuted upon Protestant Dissenters.</NOTE> This so surprized the Colonel, that he and his Companions stood amaz'd, and said, <HI>If this be your Principle as you say, we never saw the like in our Lives.</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>What I am in Words, I am the same in Life.</HI> Then the Colonel carried himself lovingly; tho' a certain Ambassador who stood without, and then came in, said, that this <HI>Irish</HI> Colonel was such a des∣perate Man, that he durst not come in with him, for fear he should have done great Mischief.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding such like rude Encounters, yet by the Change of the Government, some Stop was put to the fierce Current of Persecu∣tion; for the King being but newly settled on the Throne, shewed yet an Inclination to Lenity. But this Quiet did not last long, and was but a Time of Respiration: For the Churchmen instigated (as it seems very probable) by the Favourers of Popery, continued envious, and staid but for an Opportunity to shew their Malice. An Instance of which hath been seen already on the Insurrection of the Fifth-Monar∣chy-Men, and in the Sequel will be seen much clearer: since tho' they did not seem to persecute for Conscience-sake, yet under a Colour of Justice, Laws were made use of, that had formerly been enacted for the Suppression of Popery, and to secure the Kingdom against Jesuits, and other traiterous Papists; these being the Laws, of which <HI>G. Fox</HI> in his Letter to the King, had said, that <HI>they held up Persecution about Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Now that it may be known what Laws those were, and that it may also appear what an unreasonable Use hath been made thereof, I shall here set them down, or Abstracts of them; that so it may be more plainly seen, what aukward Means have been made use of, and how fi∣nistrously the Laws were executed. Sometimes I may interweave a∣mong these Abstracts some Observations, or an Account of a Case, which, tho' not placed in due Time, may yet be serviceable to give a true Notion of Things. I now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epair to those Laws.</P>
<P>In the 27th Year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, a Law was made for Pay∣ment of Tithes: For that King having either given or sold many Chappels and Abbies to Laymen, those Laymen had no Right, as Priests claimed to have, to summon to Ecclesiastical Courts those that failed in paying of Tithes. But for this a Law was provide, by Virtue of which a Judge of an Ecclesiastical Court might be helpful to Laymen, and in that Law it was said,
<Q>If the Judge of an Ecclesiastical Court make Complaint to two Justices of Peace <HI>(Quorum unus)</HI> of any Contumacy or Misdemeanour committed by a Defen∣dant in any Suit there depending for Tithes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 Hen. 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cap. 20.</NOTE> the said Justices shall commit such Defendant to Prison, there to remain till he shall find sufficient Surety to be bound before them by Recognizance, or otherwise to give due Obedience to the Process, Proceedings, Decrees and Sentences of the said Court.</Q></P>
<P>By this Law (which is pretended to be still in Force) many honest People have suffered, and been kept very long in Prison: For they re∣fusing to find Surety for the Payment of Tithes, which for Conscience-sake they could not give to such Ministers who lived from a forced Maintenance, and did not (as they judged) profit the People; it was in
<PB N="256" REF="003104_0267_0FEFF5B8518FCDC8"/>
the Power of the Priests to detain them Prisoners till the pretended Debt was paid; which the Persecuted judged so unreasonable, that some have therefore continued in Prison for many Years, chusing rather to die in Goal, than to uphold such Preachers by paying Tithes to them. And the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called have never offered Resistance, but Suffering and Forbearance have always been their Arms, tho' they were almost continually vexed with Laws that were never made against them; and more especially were they molested with the Oath of Supremacy, which was made in the Beginning of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tho' (it may be) projected in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, which runs thus:
<Q>I <HI>A. B.</HI> do utterly testify and declare in my Conscience, that the [King's] Highness is the only supreme Governor of this Realm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath of Su∣premacy, 1 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE> and of all other [His] Highness's Dominions and Countries, as well in <HI>all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Things or Causes,</HI> as Temporal. And that no Foreign Prince, Prelate, State or Potentate hath, or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Pre∣eminence or Authority, <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> or <HI>Spiritual,</HI> within this Realm: And therefore I do utterly renounce and forsake all Foreign Jurisdictions, Powers, Superiorities and Authorities, and do promise, That from henceforth I shall bear Faith and true Allegiance to the [King's] Highness [His] Heirs and lawful Suc∣cessors; and to my Power shall assist and defend all Jurisdiction, Privileges, Pre∣eminences and Authorities granted or belonging to the [King's] Highness, [His] Heirs and Successors, or united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm. So help me God, and by the Contents of this Book.</Q></P>
<P>In the first Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> an Act was made for Unifor∣mity of Common Prayer and Church-Service, having this Clause.
<Q>Every Person shall resort to their Parish-Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE> or upon Let thereof, to some other, every Sunday and Holiday, upon Pain to be punished by Censures of the Church, and also to forfeit twelve Pence, to be levied by the Churchwardens there, for the Ʋse of the Poor, upon the Offender's Goods by Way of Distress.</Q></P>
<P>Here is to be noted, that some have prosecuted the pretended Of∣fenders on this Clause to obviate greater Severities; altho' this Law was made because of the Papists, thereby to force them to come to Church; for about that Time there were not so many Protestant Dis∣senters in <HI>England,</HI> as afterwards; but these appearing in Time, were as well under the Lash of this Law, as the Papists; for their religious Assemblies were not reckoned to be Churches, as the Steeple-houses by a Metonymy generally have been called, at the same Rate as the <HI>Jews</HI> Meeting-houses have been called <HI>Synagogues,</HI> tho' the Word it self properly signifies the Assembly of the People.</P>
<P>Now since the aforesaid Law was was not strictly obeyed, not only by Papists, but also by others, who aiming at a further Reformation, could not longer comply with the Rites of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in the 23d Year of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a more severe Law was made, with this Clause.
<Q>Every Person not repairing to Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 Eliz. c. 2.</NOTE> according to the Statute of 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 2. shall forfeit twenty Pounds for every Month they so make Default; and if they so forbear by the space of twelve Months, after Certificate thereof made by the Ordi∣nary to the Kings Bench, a Justice of Assize, Goal-Delivery, or Peace of the County where they dwell, shall bind them with two sufficient Sureties in 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> at least, to the good Behaviour, from which they shall not be released, until they shall repair to Church according to the said Statute.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="003104_0268_0FEFF57867E5CA78"/>This Law it seems was thought not severe enough; therefore in the 29th Year of the said Queen, another Law was made with this Clause;
<Q>The Queen may seize all the Goods and two third Parts of the Lands and Leases of every Offender not repairing to Church as aforesaid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26 Eliz. c. 6.</NOTE> in such of the Terms of <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> as shall happen next after such Conviction, for the Sum then due for the Forfeiture of twenty Pounds a Month, and yearly after that (in the same Terms) according to the Rate of twenty Pounds a Month, for so long Time as they shall forbear to come to Church according to the said Statute of 23 <HI>Eliz.</HI> 1.</Q></P>
<P>Upon these Acts many were prosecuted; but in the Height of this Proceeding <HI>George Whitehead, Gilbert Latey,</HI> and others, sollicited King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId in the Behalf of their Friends; which had such Effect, that the King ordered Stay of Process in divers Counties; yet after∣wards the Persecution was continued till after his Death, both as to Imprisonment as well as seizing of Goods: And other old Laws were also made use of: For in the 35th Year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, when the Papists sometimes were forming Plots against the Queen, an Act was made, containing the Effect of this Clause.</P>
<Q><P>If any of above sixteen Years of Age shall be convicted to have absented themselves above a Month from Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">35 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE> without any lawful Cause, impugned the Queen's Authority in Causes Ecclesiastical, or frequented Conventicles, or per∣suaded others so to do, under Pretence of Exercise of Religion, they shall be com∣mitted to Prison, and there remain until they shall conform themselves, and make such open Submission as hereafter shall be prescribed: And if within three Months after such Conviction they refuse to conform, and submit themselves, be∣ing thereunto required by a Justice of the Peace, they shall in open Assize or Ses∣sions abjure the Realm: And if such Abjuration happen to be before Justices of the Peace in Sessions, they shall make Certificate thereof at the next Assize or Goal Delivery.</P>
<P><HI>And,</HI> If such an Offender refuse to abjure, or going away accordingly, doth re∣turn without the Queen's Licence, he shall be adjudged a Felon, and shall not en∣joy the Benefit of Clergy; but if before he be required to abjure, he makes his Submission, the Penalties aforesaid shall not be inflicted upon him.</P></Q>
<P>Tho' it may be supposed this Act was made chiefly against Papists, yet some few of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, have been prosecuted there∣upon, which was for their Lives; for if they had been willing to de∣part the Realm, yet such, who for Conscience-sake could not swear at all, could not oblige themselves by Oath that they would do so. And this being very well known, it once happened that one <HI>William A∣lexander</HI> of <HI>Needham</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.Alexan∣der</HI> &amp;c. in∣dicted on this Act, thro' the favourable Advice of the Judge are discharged.</NOTE> being with several more indicted upon this Act, was ask'd, <HI>Guilty or not Guilty.</HI> He not being hasty to answer, the Judge said, <HI>Why don't you plead Guilty or not Guilty?</HI> To which <HI>A∣lexander</HI> reply'd, <HI>What would'st thou advise us to plead?</HI> The Judge, (who sometimes used to be severe enough) said, <HI>Do you ask my Advice? Yes,</HI> said <HI>Alexander. Then,</HI> returned the Judge, <HI>You shall have it; and I'll advise you to plead Not Guilty.</HI> So the Prisoners accordingly pleaded <HI>Not guilty.</HI> Then said the Judge to the Prosecutors, <HI>Now you must prove these Men, neither to have been at their own Parish Church, nor at any other Church or Chappel, else they are not within this Act, which is a sanguinary Law.</HI> Thus the Judge carried or his Discourse to a Discharge of <HI>Alexander</HI> and his Friends from that severe Indictment: For the Prosecutors were not able to prove this with Evidence, as the Law required.

<P>After the Demise of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when <HI>James</HI> the First had ascended the Throne, the Papists still continued their wicked Designs, of which the Gunpowder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may serve for an instance. To suppress therefore these malicious People, and for the better discovering of them, in the third Year of that King's Reign, an Act was made, in which was contained the following Oath, which was to be taken by Popish Recusants.</P>
<P><Q>I <HI>A. B.</HI> do truly and sincerely acknowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oath of Alle∣giance made 3 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 4,</NOTE> profess, testify and declare in my Conscience, before God and the World, that our Sovereign Lord King <HI>James</HI> is lawful and rightful King of this Realm, and of all other his Majesty's Dominions and Countries; and that the Pope, neither of himself, nor by any Authority of the Church or See of <HI>Rome,</HI> or by any other Means, with any other, hath any Power or Authority to depose the King, or to dispose of any of his Majesty's King∣doms or Dominions, or to authorize any Foreign Prince to invade or annoy him, or his Countries, or to discharge any of his Subjects from their Allegiance and O∣bedience to his Majesty, or to give Licence or Leave to any of them to bear Arms raise Tumults, or to offer any Violence or Hurt to his Majesty's Royal Person, State, or Government, or to any of his Majesty's Subjects within his Majesty's Dominions. Also I do swear from my Heart, that notwithstanding any Declara∣tion, or Sentence of Excommunication or Deprivation, made or granted, or to be made or granted by the Pope or his Successors, or by any Authority derived, or pretended to be derived from him, or his See, against the said King, his Heirs or Successors, or any Absolution of the said Subjects from their Obedience, I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and him and them will defend to the uttermost of my Power, against all Conspiracies and Attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against his or their Persons, their Crown and Dignity, by Reason or Colour of any such Sentence or Declaration, or otherwise: And will do my best Endeavour to disclose and make known unto his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, all Treasons and traiterous Conspiracies, which I shall know or hear of to be against him, or any of them. And I do fur∣ther swear, that I do from my Heart abhor, detest, and abjure, as impious and heretical, this damnable Doctrine and Position, that Princes which are excommu∣nicated or deprived by the <HI>Pope,</HI> may be deposed or murdered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever. And I do believe, and in my Conscience am resolved, that neither the <HI>Pope,</HI> nor any Person whatsoever, hath Power to absolve me of this Oath, or any Part thereof, which I acknowledge by good and full Authority to be lawfully ministred unto me, and do renounce all Pardons and Dispensations to the con∣trary. And all these Things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge, and swear, according to the express Words by me spoken, and according to the plain and common Sense and Ʋnderstanding of the same Words, without any Equivocation, or mental Evasion, or secret Reservation whatsoever. And I do make this Re∣cognition and Acknowledgement, heartily, willingly, and truly, upon the true Faith of a Christian. So help me God.</Q></P>
<P>This Oath, commonly call'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Afterward called the Test.</NOTE> <HI>The Oath of Allegiance,</HI> was afterwards cal∣led by the Name of the <HI>Test;</HI> and the Introduction of it makes Mention of the Gun-powder Plot, and signifies that this Expedient was contri∣ved to discover Papists; and yet many of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> have suffered thereby many Years; for tho' they did not refuse to de∣clare their Allegiance, yet because it was well known they were not for <HI>swearing at all;</HI> this Oath was continually made use of as a Snare to imprison them. Now the Punishment stated against the Recusants was a <HI>Praemunire.</HI> And how grievously many <HI>Quakers</HI> have been oppres∣sed on that Account, tho' not easily related, yet I may give Instances

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEarly and well-beloved Brethren, in the heavenly Relation, and blessed immortal Birth, of which we are born most dearly in our Father's Love; my Salutation extendeth unto you all, as one with you perfectly in Sufferings and in Rejoicings, in Faith and Pa∣tience, and even in all Things which you do and suffer for the Name of the Lord our God; and my S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul greets you, and embraces you, and fervently wishes Peace, Love, and Unity, and the Increase of every good Gift unto you all; for I am perfectly one with you; if you receive of our Father's Fulness, I am refreshed; and if you re∣joice, I am glad; and if you suffer, and be in Heaviness, I freely par∣take with you; whatsoever is yours, whether Liberty or Bonds, whe∣ther Life or Death, I partake of the same; and whatsoever I enjoy, the same also is yours; we are of one Birth, of one Seed, of one Line, even of the Generation of him who is without Beginning of Days, or End of Life, who is an High Priest, made after the Power of an endless Life; and as he was blessed of the Father, so are we, because we are of the same Birth, and are Partakers of his Na∣ture, and he lives in us, and we in him.</P>
<P>Well, my dear Companions, I need not multiply Words unto you, as if you knew not these Things; for, what know I, that you know not? Or, what can I say, but you know the same? Yet bear with me, for my Heart is very full, and my Soul ready to be poured forth, that I may once more express a little Quantity of what is abounding in my Heart; for Love, even perfect Love, even that Love wherewith we are beloved of the Father, filleth my Heart at this Time towards all of you, from the least to the greatest; and I know nothing but Love towards you all; and I doubt not but in the same Love you do receive this my <HI>Salutation,</HI> which is from the Fountain of Love, which at this Time is opened in my Heart.</P>
<P>Now, dearly Beloved, the present Considerations of my Heart are very many concerning the great Love of the Father, which hitherto hath been shewed unto us; we all know, how that he called us by his Grace, and turned our Hearts from the Vanities, and evil Ways of this World, and sanctified us by his Word, and put his Image up∣on us, and called us by his Name, and redeemed us unto himself, and gave us the Testimony of his holy Spirit in our own Hearts, <HI>That we should be his People, and he would be our God;</HI> he taught us, and instruc∣ted us, and fed us, and gave us Peace and Rest in himself, and freed us from the Bondage of Sin and Corruption, and from his Terror be∣cause of Sin; and he removed our Transgressions, and blotted them out, and ceased to smite us any more, but brought us into the Land of Rest, flowing with Mercy, and Peace, and Knowledge, and all good Things: This did the Lord our God do for us, in the Days of our Infancy, even when we were yet in our Sins, he called us forth, and cleansed us from them; and when we were Strangers to him, he made himself known unto us; and when we were wholly ignorant, he gave us Knowledge, and when we were not a People, he raised us up, and made us worthy to be called by his Name; and thus, and after this Manner did the Father love us, and shew his Love unto us: This you know even as I do, and the Consideration of it causeth me thus to express it.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="003104_0271_0FEFF5BE610C24E0"/>Again, when he had thus wrought for us, and shewed Love unto us, he was pleased to call us out into his Work, to the turning and converting of others unto the Way of Life; he put his Spirit into us, and gave us Gifts of Knowledge and Utterance, and armed us with Wisdom, and Strength, and Courage, and every Way fitted us for that Work and Service in which he hath carried us on; he, I say, fitted us for his Work, and called us into it, and carried us on joyfully in it, and all this of his free Love, and infinite Power; and what we have been, and what we have done, it hath been only of the Lord, and not of our selves, even of his Love which to us may be admirable; for alas, what were we but Children, and neither Pro∣phets, nor Prophets Sons, and our Education unanswerable for these Things, and to perform this Calling? And therefore it is the Lord, and only him that hath effected his own Purpose through us, and by us, as Instruments mean of our selves, but by him very excellent.</P>
<P>Again, he hath mightily prosper'd us in his Work, and a glorious Effect we have beheld of our Labours, and Travels, and Testimony; yea, the Lord hath been with us abundantly, and his Arm hath com∣passed us about, and he hath often given us great Victory over the Wise and Prudent of this World; he hath made his own Word often very powerful in our Mouths, to the wounding of the Con∣sciences of our Enemies; and the Lord hath blessed our Testimony, to the Confounding of the Wisdom of this World, and to the gather∣ing of many unto himself; and he hath gone forth before us in his Authority, and been always with us in his own Work; and our Te∣stimonies, Labours, and Travels have been very precious and pleasant unto the Lord, and all his People, and the Effect thereof causeth my Soul to rejoice, because the Lord hath been with us, and pros∣pered us unto a great People, who have received our Witness, and ac∣cepted thereof unto their Salvation, and unto the Lord alone the Glory of all this appertaineth.</P>
<P>And for these eight Years and upward, the Hand of the Lord hath carried us thro' great Labours and Travels in his Service, and many Dangers, and Persecutions, and Afflictions have attended us all this Time; and ye know that many a Time hath the Lord delivered us from the Hands of such as would have destroyed us; and we have been de∣livered again, and again, out of Dangers and Difficulties, and the Lord hath been a present Help unto us in the Time of our Trouble; for the Plotting of the Wicked, and the Purpose of ungodly Men, hath often been broken for our Sakes, even many a Time have we been delivered out of the Snare that hath been laid for us, and we have seen our Enemies fall before us on the Right Hand, and on the Left; even the Wise in their Worldly Wisdom, and the Foolish in their Brutishness, both Professors and Profane hath our God often cut short in their Desires and Endeavours of our Destruction; and we have been wonderfully preserved unto this Day; and all this I attribute to the infinite Love and Power of the Lord God, who is blessed for evermore.</P>
<P>And thro' all these Things we are yet alive, and the Lord doth not fail us unto this Hour, but he lives and walks in us, and with us, and his Testimony is with us, even the Seal of his good Spirit in our Hearts, that we are his Sons and Servants, and we are confirmed by many Tokens that he is our God, and we are his People, and that great Oppression which we have met withal, hath not restrained us, but thro' it all have we grown, and prospered unto this Day: And concerning the Things whereof we have testified these divers Years, I am no Way doubtful but our God will fulfil them, neither can
<PB N="261" REF="003104_0272_0FEFF57D82356630"/>
my Confidence be shaken by what is or can come to pass; for Anti∣christ must fall, false <HI>Ministry</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> false <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Doctrines</HI> God will confound, false <HI>Power</HI> and false <HI>Church</HI> the Lord will lay low, and <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> must reign; and God will gather his People more and more, and glorious Days will appear; God will exalt his Kingdom upon Earth, and throw down the Kingdom of the Man of Sin; all Oppression must cease, and the Oppressors shall be no more; and God will free his People, and they shall be happy in this World, and for ever: These Things have we prophesied from Day to Day; and my Faith is constant and unmoveable, that God will effect these Things in his Season; for the Lord never yet de∣ceived me, but what he hath said will surely come to pass.</P>
<P>And therefore, Brethren, let us be in Hope and Patience, and live in the Word of Patience, and not be faint-hearted, as tho' the Lord had forgotten us, or was unmindful of us, or as tho' he would not perform what he had testified of by us; for he is not a Man, that he should lie, nor as a Man that he is given to Change: But lift up your Heads, for the Lord is with us, even in our greatest Tribulations and Afflictions, and he will accomplish his Purpose; for he is mighty to save his People, and to destroy his Enemies.</P>
<P>It is true, the Gates of Hell at this Time seem to be open against us, and we are a People like to be swallowed up of our Enemies, and Floods of Wickedness seem to overflow, and the Waves of the great Sea seem to be void of Mercy, and the Hope of our Adversaries is to extinguish us from being a People, and to destroy us from the Face of the Earth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Hands of our Persecutors are highly exalted at this Day, as tho' all that we have done for the Lord, by our Labours and Travels, should now be made of none Effect.</P>
<P>Well, dear Brethren, tho' it be thus, yet our God can deliver us, and confound our Adversaries; and we can appeal unto our God, and can spread our Cause before him; and he knows that our Sufferings and Afflictions are altogether unjust, and unequal, and unrighteous, and that our Persecutors do afflict us out of their <HI>Envy,</HI> and with∣out any just Cause administred unto them by us; our God knows it, Angels and Saints know it, that we are at this Day a persecuted People for Religion's-sake; and this our present Affliction is not any just Punishment, either from the Justice of God, or from the Justice of Men.</P>
<P>For God hath given us the Witness of his eternal Spirit, that Wrath is not in him towards us; his Wrath be to his Enemies, but unto us is Joy and Peace for evermore: And the Lord clears us, and he justi∣fies us, who then shall condemn us? He chargeth no Guilt upon us, as if we were unto our selves the Cause, by our Evil Deeds, of these our present Sufferings, and as if this were come to pass upon us, as Punishment from the Hand of God: I say, it is not so; these our present Sufferings are not out of God's Anger towards us, for his Love is to us, let his Wrath be to his Enemies: And as I said, neither is this Suffering in the Justice of Men; for unto all the World we can say, (and God himself shall plead our Cause) whom have we wronged or done Evil to? What Evil have we done to any Man's Person? Whose Goods have we falsly taken or coveted? Against whom have we designed Mischief? Even the Lord himself be Judge between us and our Persecutors in this Matter; for unto him we are known that we do desire the Good of all, and not the Hurt of any, and yet we are dealt with as Evil-doers; when as the God of Heaven is Wit∣ness in our Consciences, that we neither plot nor contrive, nor agi∣tate in Thought or Word the Hurt of any Man's Person; but we
<PB N="262" REF="003104_0273_0FEFF5C0428ECCE8"/>
walk justly towards all, it being our Principle to do to others as we would be done unto; and we can plead our Cause unto our God, and he shall plead our Cause with our Enemies, and this is the pre∣sent State of our Case; what we suffer at this Time, it is singly in the Cause of God, and for Righteousness-sake, and for the Testi∣mony of Jesus, which we hold; therefore freely let us commit our Cause unto the God of Heaven, and if we die, it is for him, and if we live, it is to him; and we seek not Vengeance against our Ene∣mies, but leave it to the Lord to plead with them.</P>
<P>And dearly beloved, I hope I need not exhort you to be patient, and faithful, in this Day of our Trial, knowing that the Cause is so excellent in which we are tried, it is God's Cause, and not our own; and I hope you all have the Testimony of his Spirit in your Consci∣ences, verifying the Truth of the Cause for which we suffer; and ha∣ving that Evidence, we need not to be doubtful as towards God, nor ashamed before Men, if so be that every one feels the Evidence of the Spirit of God bearing Witness, that we suffer for Righteousness-sake, and for the Name of Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>And so, dear Brethren, lift up your Heads, and be assured that we are the Lord's, and in his Cause we are tried, and he will judge and avenge our Persecutors in his Season, and we shall be a People when the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> lie dead upon the Sea-shore, and when the raging Sea is dried up, this same People shall be safe: For hath the Lord done so excellent Things for us? Hath he led us forth, and blessed us un∣to this Day? And hath he preserved us hitherto thro' many Tribu∣lations and Dangers? Hath he shewed infinite Love and Favour un∣to us to this Hour? And will he now suffer us to be destroyed from being a People? Surely no. Will he give our Enemies their Heart's Desire to out us all off, that they may blaspheme his Name? Surely no. And if it be the Pleasure of the Lord, that some of us should seal our Testimony with our Blood, good is the Will of the Lord; not ours but his Will be done; for the Testimony that we have born for these divers Years, hath been so excellent in it self, and in its Fruits and Effects, that the finishing of it deserves the best Seal that possi∣bly we can sign it with, which is indeed our Heart's Blood; and this dwells upon my Spirit; and yet, tho' it should be thus, my Con∣fidence is sure, that the Work of the Lord shall prosper, and our Testimony shall be glorious for ever, and this People shall never be extinguished from being a People.</P>
<P>And I know not any Thing that remains upon our Part at this Day, but that we commit our selves into the Hand of the Lord, li∣ving in the Seed of God, wherein our Election is sure, before the World was, and for ever: And let us remember one another, and pray one for another; and let us stir up all the Children of our Father to Faithfulness and Patience, while we have Time; I say, let us walk to the Glory of the Lord, keeping Faith and a good Conscience to our last End; our Testimony shall dever die, nor our Memories ever pe∣rish when we are ceased to be; and tho' we suffer now the Loss of Life, and all we have, yet the Effects thereof will be glorious in Ages to come, and our present Sufferings will hasten the Glory of God's Work throughout the World: Receive this as my Salutation to you all.</P>
<P>It is now eight Days since I left <HI>Ireland,</HI> where my Service hath been precious for the Lord for full six Months, all which Time the Lord carried me in much Faithfulness and Diligence in his Service, to the confirming of many in the Truth of God, and to the converting of
<PB N="263" REF="003104_0274_0FEFF57FAFC11130"/>
others; and thro' and because of the Presence of the Lord which was with me, I had a very precious Time, and was wonderfully pre∣served thro' many Dangers and Trials; and I travelled near two thousand Miles to and fro in that Land, and had very free Passage in the principal Cities and Towns, till my Work for the present was fully ended there, having more Time than could be expected to clear my Conscience to all People. It would be too large to mention every partiular Transaction, wherein I perceived the eminent Hand of God with me; and also many Things I observed concerning the present State of Things which I shall not mention; for what have we to do with the Affairs of worldly Kingdoms? But as for Friends, it was well with them, they grow and increase in the Blessings and Fulness of the Father; and when I came thence all was quiet, and very few in Prison, tho' (I suppose) the Tidings of Things as they are here, will produce the same Sufferings upon them: But I hope they will be bold and valiant for the Truth, in giving their Testimony by faithful Sufferings, till these Things be finished.</P>
<P>Thus I remain in Life and Death, and when I am no more, in everlasting Remembrance, your dear Brother and Companion, by doing and suffering for the Name of the Lord and his Truth. I am well, and at Liberty as yet.</P>

to Authority, would have justified a severer Animadversion, yet the Pru∣dence of this Court was exercised, only in making Provision to secure the Peace and Order here established, against their Attempts, whose Design (we were well assured by our own Experience, as well as by the Example of their Predecessors in <HI>Munster</HI>) was to undermine and ruin the same.</P>
<P>And accordingly a Law was made and published, prohibiting all Masters of Ships to bring any <HI>Quakers</HI> into this Jurisdiction, and themselves from coming in on Penalty of the House of Correction, till they should be sent away. Not∣withstanding which, by a Back-door they found Entrance, and the Penalty inflict∣ed on themselves proving insufficient to restrain their impudent and insolent Ob∣trusions, was encreased by the Loss of the Ears of those who offended the second Time; which also being too weak a Defence against their impetuous frantick Fury, necessitated us to endeavour our Security; and upon serious Consideration, after the former Experiments by their incessant Assaults, a Law was made, That such Persons should be banished upon Pain of Death, according to the Example of <HI>England,</HI> in their Provision against Jesuits; which Sentence being regularly pronounced at the last Court of Assistants, against the Parties above-named, and they either returning, or continuing presumptuously in this Jurisdiction after the Time limited, were apprehended, and owning themselves to be the Persons ba∣nished, were sentenced by the Court to Death, according to the Law aforesaid, which hath been executed upon two of them. <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> (upon Petition of her Son, and the Mercy and Clemency of this Court) had Liberty to depart within two Days; which she hath accepted of. The Consideration of our gradual Pro∣ceeding will vindicate us from the clamorous Accusations of Severity, our own just and necessary Defence calling upon us (other Means failing) to offer the Point, which those Persons have violently and wilfully rushed upon, and thereby become Felons <HI>de se;</HI> which, might it have been prevented, and the sovereign Law, <HI>salus populi,</HI> been preserved, our former Proceedings, as well as the sparing <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> upon an inconsiderable Intercession, will manifestly evince, that we desire their Lives absent, rather than their Deaths present.</P>

<P>In this Apology, wherein the <HI>Quakers</HI> (who always were an harm∣less People, and never made Resistance with outward Arms) are com∣pared to the mutinous and riotous <HI>Anabaptists</HI> of <HI>Munster,</HI> it is also said of them, that <HI>by a Back-door they found Entrance.</HI> And this reflects on some who unexpectedly came into <HI>New-England</HI> by Land, since they could find no Opportunity to come by Sea, because the Ship-Masters fearing the Severity of the <HI>Boston</HI> Laws, were unwilling to carry any <HI>Quakers</HI> thither. This gave Occasion to <HI>Thomas Thirstone</HI> (who having been already at Boston,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Thirstone</HI> and <HI>J. Coale</HI> go from <HI>Eng∣land</HI> to <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> from whence with <HI>T. Chapman</HI> they travel on foot to <HI>New-England,</HI> thro' many Dan∣gers.</NOTE> was sent away on Board a Ship) to think on other Means; for finding himself moved in Spirit to go thither again, he and <HI>Josiah Coale</HI> (of whom Mention hath been made before, and who may be farther spoken of hereafter) went from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Virginia,</HI> from whence they with one <HI>Thomas Chapman</HI> travelled several hundreds of Miles on Foot thro' vast Wildernesses and Woods, and so at length came into <HI>New-England,</HI> which made the Persecutors there astonished; for they thought this impossible, that Way having been accounted un∣passable for other Men than the <HI>Indians,</HI> many of whom in those Parts are warlike Men, who behaved themselves well toward our Travel∣lers, whose Journey however was very hard; for they had not only Hun∣ger and Cold (it being Winter-time) to encounter with, but they were also in Danger of being devoured by wild Beasts, or of perishing in unknown Marshes or Bogs. But they were preserved by an Almighty Hand; tho' this marvellous Passage was represented like a criminal Sauciness by these <HI>New-England</HI> Persecutors.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="003104_0277_0FEFF5C44F831D78"/>It seems to me that the aforesaid Apology, (which was published in Print, and likewise answered) was given forth before <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> was put to Death; but after her Death the General Court of <HI>Boston</HI> sent over an Address to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, signed by their Governor <HI>John Indicot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Substance of an Address from the Ge∣neral Court at <HI>Boston,</HI> to K. <HI>Ch. II.</HI></NOTE> to justify their cruel Proceedings. Herein they said, <HI>That they had chosen rather the pure Scripture Worship, with a good Conscience, in that remote Wilderness among the Heathen, than the Pleasures of</HI> England <HI>with Subjection to the Imposition of the then so disposed, and so far prevailing Hierar∣chy, which they could not do without an evil Conscience.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Quakers</HI> they said, that they were <HI>open capital Blasphe∣mers, and Seducers from the Glorious Trinity, the Lord Christ, the blessed Gos∣pel, open Enemies to the Government it self, and malignant Promoters of Doc∣trines directly tending to subvert both Church and State.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover they said, <HI>That at last they had been constrained for their own Safety to pass a Sentence of Banishment against them on Pain of Death, since the Magistrate in Conscience judged himself called for the Defence of all, to keep the Passage with the Point of the Sword held towards them; and that this could do no Harm to them that would be warned thereby; but the</HI> Quakers <HI>rushing themselves thereupon was their own Act, and a Crime bringing their Blood upon their own Heads.</HI></P>
<P>Could they have made the King believe this, they would willingly have done it; but he had too much Sense to be thus imposed upon, tho' they did whatever they could to prevent his hearing the other Par∣ty, in Order whereunto they said, <HI>Let not the King hear Men's Words; your Servants are true Men, Fearers of God and the King, and not given to Change, zealous of Government and Order, not seditious to the Interests of Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>How smooth and plausible soever this seemed, yet it could not stand the Test; and <HI>E. Burroughs,</HI> who answered it in Print, address'd the King thus.
<Q>O King, this my Occasion to present Thee with these Considerations is very urgent, and of great Necessity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To which <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> returns an Answer in print ad∣dress'd to the said King.</NOTE> even in the Behalf of innocent Blood, hoping that my Work will find such Favour with thee, as to induce thee to the Reading and serious Consideration thereof.</Q></P>
<P><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> then examining all their pretended Reasons, represented also to the King, how some of these Petitioners some Time before, had not stuck to write in a Letter from <HI>Boston</HI> to one <HI>Gordon; There is more Danger in these</HI> Quakers <HI>to trouble and overcome</HI> England, <HI>than in the</HI> King of Scots, <HI>and all the Popish Princes in</HI> Germany; which plainly denoted, that they reputed the King a Troubler of <HI>England,</HI> whom they numbred with the Popish Princes of <HI>Germany.</HI> What <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> ob∣tained of the King for his Friends, we may see hereafter.</P>
<P>But first I return to <HI>William Leddra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Leddra</HI> brought with his Log and Chains before the Court.</NOTE> whom I left in Prison. It was on the ninth of the first Month of this Year, that he was brought into the Court of Assistants, with his Chains and Log at his Heels. And he asking the Goaler, <HI>When he intended to take off the Irons from his Legs?</HI> The Goaler roughly answered, <HI>When thou art going to be hang'd. W. Led∣dra</HI> then being brought to the Bar, it was told him by the Rulers, speaking of their Law, <HI>That he was found guilty, and so that he was to die.</HI> He said, <HI>What Evil have I done?</HI> The Answer was, <HI>His own Confession was as good as a thousand Witnesses.</HI> He asked, <HI>What that was?</HI> To which they answered, <HI>That he owned those</HI> Quakers <HI>that were put to Death, and that they were innocent.</HI> Besides, <HI>That he would not put off his Hat in Court,</HI> and that he said, <HI>Thee and Thou.</HI> Then said <HI>William</HI> to them, <HI>You will put me to Death for speaking</HI> English, <HI>and for not putting off my Cloaths?</HI> To this Major General <HI>Denison</HI> returned, <HI>A Man may speak Treason in</HI> English. And <HI>William</HI> reply'd, <HI>Is it Treason to say</HI> Thee <HI>and</HI> Thou <HI>to a single Per∣son?</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="003104_0278_0FEFF584CA5591A0"/>
But none answered, only <HI>Simon Broadstreet,</HI> one of the Court, ask∣ed him, <HI>Whether he would go for</HI> England? To which he answered, <HI>I have no Business there.</HI> Hereupon <HI>Broadstreet,</HI> pointing to the Gallows, said, <HI>Then you shall go that Way.</HI> To which <HI>William</HI> returned, <HI>What will ye put me to Death for breathing in the Air in your Jurisdiction? And for what you have against me I appeal to the Laws of</HI> England <HI>for my Trial; and if by them I am guilty, I refuse not to die.</HI> Of this no Notice was taken, but instead thereof, they endeavoured to persuade him <HI>to recant of his Error</HI> (as they stiled it) <HI>and to conform;</HI> to which with a grave Magnanimity he answered, <HI>What! to join with such Murtherers as you are? Then let every Man that meets me say, Lo this is the Man that hath forsaken the God of his Sal∣vation.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst the Trial of <HI>W. Leddra</HI> was thus going on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.Christison</HI> under Sen∣tence of Ban∣ishment on Pain of Death appears in Court.</NOTE> <HI>Wenlock Christison,</HI> who was already banished upon Pain of Death, came into the Court. This struck a Damp upon them, insomuch that for some Space of Time there was Silence in the Court: But at length one of the bloody Coun∣cil cried, <HI>Here is another; fetch him up to the Bar.</HI> Which the Marshal performing, the Secretary <HI>Rawson</HI> said, <HI>Is not your Name</HI> Wenlock Chri∣stison? <HI>Yea,</HI> said <HI>Wenlock. Well,</HI> said the Governor <HI>John Indicot, What dost thou here? Wast thou not banished upon Pain of Death?</HI> To which <HI>Wen∣lock</HI> answered, <HI>Yea, I was.</HI> And to the Question, <HI>What dost thou here then,</HI> he answered, <HI>I am come here to warn you, that you should shed no more inno∣cent Blood, for the Blood that you have shed already, cries to the Lord God for Vengeance to come upon you.</HI> Whereupon it was said, <HI>Take him away Goaler.</HI></P>
<P>It having been told <HI>W. Leddra,</HI> <Q>That the last General Court he had Liberty given him to go for <HI>England,</HI> or to go out of their Jurisdic∣tion; and that promising to do so, and come there no more, he might save his Life:</Q> He answered, <HI>I stand not in my own Will, but in the Will of the Lord: If I may have my Freedom, I shall go,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence of Death pronounced a∣gainst <HI>W.Leddra.</HI></NOTE> but to make you a Promise I cannot.</HI> But this was so far from giving Content, that they proceed∣ed to pronounce Sentence of Death against him; which being done, he was led from the Court to Prison again, where the Day before his Death, he wrote the following Letter to his Friends.</P>

<P>THE sweet Influences of the Morning Star, like a Flood distilling into my innocent Habitation, hath so filled me with the Joy of the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness, that my Spirit is as if it did not inhabit a Tabernacle of Clay, but is wholly swallowed up in the Bosom of Eternity, from whence it had its Being.</P>
<P>Alas, alas!

<P>The next Day after this Letter was written, the Execution of <HI>W. Leddra</HI> was performed, which was on the 14th of the first Month.

he was chained in Prison, from the Time he was condemned, to the Day of his Execution. <HI>I am not of his Opinion; but yet truly methought the Lord did mightily appear in the Man. I went to one of the Magistrates of</HI> Cambridge, <HI>who had been of the Jury that condemned him, (as he told me him∣self) and I asked him by what Rule he did it?

<P><HI>William Leddra</HI> being thus dispatch'd, it was resolved to make an End also of <HI>Wenlock Christison.</HI> He therefore was brought from the Prison, to the Court at <HI>Boston,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.Christison</HI> brought before the Court, threatned and sent buck to Prison.</NOTE> where the Governor <HI>John Indicot,</HI> and the Depu∣ty Governor <HI>Richard Billingham,</HI> being both present, it was told him, <HI>Ʋn∣less you will renounce your Religion, you shall surely die.</HI> But instead of shrink∣ing, he said with an undaunted Courage, <HI>Nay, I shall not change my Re∣ligion, nor seek to save my Life; neither do I intend to deny my Master; but if I lose my Life for Christ's-sake, and the preaching of the Gospel, I shall save my Life.</HI> This noble Resolution gave such a Check to his Persecutors, that they did not then go on with the Trial, but sent him away to Prison again.

That the Sun abhorring this bloody Business, hid it self from them. But after many Debates, the sanguinary Council at length agreed, and <HI>Wenlock</HI> was brought to the Bar; where the Governor <HI>John Indicot</HI> asked him, <HI>What he had to say for himself, why he should not die?</HI> He answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.Christison</HI> brought to the Bar and exa∣min'd.</NOTE> <HI>I have done nothing worthy of Death, if I had, I refuse not to die.</HI> To this another said, <HI>Thou art come in amongst us in Rebellion, which is as the Sin of Witch∣craft, and ought to be punished.</HI> Hence it appears how perversely these Blood-thirsty Persecutors apply'd the Holy Scriptures to their cruel Ends, and so made a wrong Use of the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Words to <HI>Saul:</HI> To which false Conclusion <HI>Wenlock</HI> answered, <HI>I came not among you in Rebellion, but in Obedience to the God of Heaven, not in Contempt to any of you, but in Love to your Souls and Bodies; and that you shall know one Day, when you and all Men must give an Account of the Deeds done in the Body. Take Heed</HI> (thus he went on) <HI>for you cannot escape the righteous Judg∣ments of God.</HI> Then said Major General <HI>Adderton, You pronounce Woes, and Judgments, and those that are gone before you pronounced Woes and Judg∣ments; but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon us yet.</HI> So in∣solent and hard Hearted may Man become, as not to stick even to de∣fy the most High. But before we draw the Curtains of this Stage, we shall see the tragical End of this <HI>Adderton,</HI> who now received this Answer from <HI>Wenlock: Be not proud, neither let your Spirits be lifted up; God doth but wait till the Measure of your Iniquity be filled up, and that you have run your ungodly Race; then will the Wrath of God come upon you to the uttermost. And as for thy Part, it hangs over thy Head, and is near to be poured down up∣on thee, and shall come as a Thief in the Night suddenly, when thou thinkest not of it.</HI> Then <HI>Wenlock</HI> asked, <HI>By what Law will ye put me to Death?</HI> The Answer was, <HI>We have a Law, and by our Law you are to die. So said the</HI> Jews, <HI>of Christ,</HI> (reply'd <HI>Wenlock) We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to die. Who impowered you to make that Law?</HI> To which one of the Board answered, <HI>We have a Patent, and are the Patentees; judge whether we have not Power to make Laws.</HI> Hereupon <HI>Wenlock</HI> asked again, <HI>How, have you Power to make Laws repugnant to the Laws of</HI> England? <HI>No,</HI> said the Governor. <HI>Then (reply'd <HI>Wenlock</HI>) you are gone beyond your Bounds, and have forfeited your Patent; and that is more than you can answer. Are you</HI> (asked he) <HI>Subjects to the King, yea, or nay? What good will that do you,</HI> reply'd the Secretary. <HI>If you are,</HI> (answered <HI>Wenlock) say so; for in your Petition to the King, you desire that he would protect you, and that you may be worthy to kneel amongst his loyal Subjects.</HI> To which one said, <HI>Yea, we are so. Well,</HI> said <HI>Wenlock, so am I, and for any Thing I know, am as good as you, if not better; for if the King did but know your Hearts, as God knows them, he would see that they are as rotten towards him as they are towards God: Therefore seeing that you and I are Subjects to the King, I demand to be tried by the Laws of my own Nation.</HI> It was answered, <HI>You shall be tried by a Bench and a Jury:</HI> For it seems they began to be afraid to go on in the former Course, of Trial without a Jury, this being contrary to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> But <HI>Wenlock</HI> said, <HI>That is not the Law, but the Manner of it: For I never heard, nor read of any Law that was in</HI> England <HI>to hang</HI> Quakers. To this the Governor reply'd, That <HI>there was a Law to hang</HI> Jesuits, To which <HI>Wenlock</HI> returned, <HI>If you put me Death, it is not because I go under the Name of a</HI> Jesuit, <HI>but of a</HI> Quaker: <HI>Therefore I appeal to the Laws of my own Nation.</HI> But instead of taking Notice of this, one said, <HI>That he was in their Hands, and had broken their Law, and they would try him. Wen∣lock</HI> still appealed to the Law of his own Nation. Yet the Jury being called over, went out, but quickly returned, and brought him in guil∣ty. Whereupon the Secretary said, Wenlock Christison, <HI>hold up your Hand. I will not,</HI> said <HI>Wenlock, I am here, and can hear thee.</HI> Then the Secretary cried, <HI>Guilty or not Guilty. I deny all Guilt,</HI> reply'd <HI>Wenlock, for
<PB N="272" REF="003104_0283_0FEFF5CEEA664368"/>
my Conscience is clear in the Sight of God.</HI> But the Governor said, <HI>The Ju∣ry hath condemned thee. Wenlock</HI> answer'd, <HI>The Lord doth justify me; who art thou that condemnest?</HI> They then voted as to the Sentence of Death, but were in a Manner confounded, for several could not vote him guilty of Death. The Governor seeing this Division, said, <HI>I could find in my Heart to go Home;</HI> being in such a Rage, that he flung some∣thing furiously on the Table; which made <HI>Wenlock</HI> cry, <HI>It were better for thee to be at home than here, for thou art about a bloody Piece of Work.</HI> Then the Governor put the Court to vote again; but this was done confusedly, which to incensed the Governor, that he stood up, and said, <HI>You that will not consent, record it; I thank God, I am not afraid to give Judgment.</HI> Thus we see that to be drunk with Blood doth not quench the Thirst after Blood; for <HI>Indicot</HI> the Governor, seeing others backward to vote, precipitately pronounced Judgment himself, and said, Wen∣lock Christison,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indicot</HI> pro∣nounces Sen∣tence of Death against him.</NOTE> <HI>hearken to your Sentence: You must return unto the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you must be hang'd until you are dead, dead, dead.</HI> To which <HI>Wenlock</HI> said, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done, in whose Will I came amongst you, and in whose Counsel I stand, feeling his eternal Power, that will uphold me unto the last Gasp.</HI> Moreover he cried thus; <HI>Known be it unto you all, that if ye have Power to take my Life from me, my Soul shall enter into everlasting Rest and Peace with God, where you your selves shall never come. And if ye have Pow∣er to take my Life from me, the which I do question, I do believe you shall never more take</HI> Quakers <HI>Lives from them: Note my Words; do not think to weary out the living God, by taking away the Lives of his Servants. What do you gain by it? For the last Man that you have put to Death, here are five come in his Room. And if ye have Power to take my Life from me, God can raise up the same Principle of Life in ten of his Servants, and send them among you in my Room, that you may have Torment upon Torment, which is your Por∣tion; for there is no Peace to the Wicked, saith my God.</HI> The holy Confi∣dence with which he uttered these Words, shew, and the Sequel made it appear plainly, that something supernatural was contained in them: And it is remarkable, that among the imprison'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> there were then several that had been banished on Pain of Death; and among these also <HI>Elizabeth Hooton,</HI> and <HI>Edward Wharton</HI> staid in his Habitation contrary to his Sentence of Banishment. <HI>Wenlock</HI> having received Sen∣tence of Death, was brought to Prison again, where having been de∣tain'd five Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is brought back to Prison, detain'd five Days, and then with 27 more of his Friends set at Liberty.</NOTE> the Marshal and a Constable came to him, with an Order from the Court for his Enlargement, with twenty-seven more of his friends, then in Prison for their Testimony to the Truth, saying, They were ordered by the Court to make him acquainted with their new Law. <HI>What means this?</HI> said <HI>Wenlock, Have ye a new Law? Yes,</HI> said they. <HI>Then ye have deceived most People,</HI> said <HI>Wenlock. Why?</HI> said they. <HI>Because,</HI> said he, <HI>they did think the Gallows had been your last Wea∣pon. Your Magistrates said, that your Law was a good and wholesome Law, made for your Peace, and the Safe-guard of your Country. What, are your Hands now become weak? The Power of God is over you all.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Prison Doors were opened, and <HI>Wenlock,</HI> with twenty-seven more of his Friends, as aforesaid, set at Liberty, save that two of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Only <HI>P.Pearson</HI> and <HI>Jud. Brown</HI> were first whipt at the Carts Tail thro Boston. The Persecu∣tors apprehend the King's Displeasure, who is offend∣ed on reading a Relation of their Cruel∣ties in <HI>G.

<P>Now tho' not long after an Order came from the King, as will be said anon, whereby these Persecutors were charged to desist from put∣ting the <HI>Quakers</HI> to Death, yet it seems they had got some Scent of the King's Displeasure, who had a Mind to stop their bloody Career: For having got a Book written by <HI>George Bishop,</HI> containing a Relation of

the cruel Persecution in <HI>New-England,</HI> and reading a Passage concerning Major General <HI>Denison,</HI> who to put off those that complained of their wicked Proceedings, said, <HI>This Year ye will go to complain to the Parlia∣ment, and the next Year they will send to see how it is; and the third Year the Government is changed,</HI> he took much Notice of this, and cal∣ling to the Lords to hear it, said, <HI>Lo, these are my good Subjects of</HI> New-England! <HI>But I will put a Stop to them.</HI> And it was not long be∣fore an Opportunity was offered; for the News of <HI>William Leddra</HI>'s Death being come into <HI>England,</HI> with an Information of the Danger that others were in of going the same Way, their Friends took it so to Heart, especially <HI>Edward Burroughs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To prevent the like, <HI>E. Bur∣roughs</HI> goes to the King, who promises to put a Stop thereto, and immediately grants a <HI>Man∣damus.</HI></NOTE> that having got Audience of the King, he said to him, <HI>There was a Vein of innocent Blood opened in his Do∣minions, which, if it were not stopt, would over-run all.</HI> To which the King replied, <HI>But I will stop that Vein.</HI> Then <HI>Burroughs</HI> desired him to do it speedily, <HI>for we know not,</HI> said he, <HI>how many may soon be put to Death.</HI> The King answered, <HI>As speedily as you will. Call</HI> (said he to some present) <HI>the Secretary, and I will do it presently.</HI> The Secretary being come, a <HI>Mandamus</HI> was forthwith granted. A Day or two after, going again to the King, to desire Dispatch of the Matter, the King said, He had no Occasion at present to send a Ship thither; but if they would send one, they might do it assoon as they could. <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> then asked the King, if it would please him to grant his Deputation to one called a <HI>Quaker,</HI> to carry the <HI>Mandamus</HI> to <HI>New-England.</HI> The King answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With a Depu∣tation to <HI>S.

<P>This <HI>Mandamus</HI> to the Rulers of <HI>New-England</HI> being obtained, as hath been said, quick Dispatch was thought necessary to send it thi∣ther. And <HI>Samuel Shattock</HI> being impowered by the King to carry it, an Agreement was made with one <HI>Ralph Goldsmith,</HI> who was Master of a good Ship, and also one of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> for three hundred Pounds, (Goods or no Goods) to sail in ten Days. He then imme∣diately made all Things ready to set sail; and with a prosperous Gale arrived in about six Weeks Time before the Town of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.

<P>All being thus kept close,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who the next Day after de∣livers the King's <HI>Man∣damus.</HI></NOTE> and none of the Ship's Company suffered to go on Shore that Day, next Morning <HI>Samuel Shattock</HI> the King's Deputy, and <HI>Ralph Goldsmith,</HI> the Commander of the Vessel, went on Shore; and sending the Men that landed them back to the Ship, they two went thro' the Town to the Governor <HI>John Indicot</HI>'s Door, and knock'd.

<P>Then they consulted what to do, that they might not incur the King's Displeasure; and it was agreed to send a Deputation to him. First Co∣lonel <HI>Temple</HI> was sent to acquaint the King with their having set the <HI>Quakers</HI> at Liberty; and he was followed not long after by the chief Priest <HI>John Norton,</HI> and <HI>Simon Broadstreet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. <HI>Temple</HI> first, and after Priest <HI>Norton</HI> and <HI>S.

<P>The Year was now spent: But before I conclude it, I must take No∣tice, as a pregnant Instance of the marvellous Vicissitude of mundane Affairs, that in the fore-Part of this Year the Body of <HI>O. Cromwel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bodies of <HI>Cromwel, Bradshaw &amp; Ireton</HI> hang'd at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> and their Heads set up on <HI>Westmin∣ster-hall.</HI></NOTE> which had been buried with great State in <HI>Westminster</HI> Abbey, was digged up, as were also the Bodies of <HI>Bradshaw</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> which three Corpses were carried in Carts to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> and there hang'd on the Gallows. Then the Executioner chopp'd off the Heads, stamp'd with his Foot on the Bodies, which were tumbled into a Pit, dug near the Gallows; and the Heads were exposed on the Top of <HI>Westminster Hall,</HI> where I remem∣ber to have seen them. And that now befel <HI>Cromwel,</HI> which he said a∣bout seven Years before in his Speech to the Parliament, as hath been mentioned in its due Place, <HI>viz. That he would rather be rowled into the Grave, and buried with Infamy, than give his Consent to the throwing away one of the Fundamentals of that Government,</HI> to wit, <HI>Liberty of Conscience.</HI> And yet he suffered Persecution to go on, as hath been related at large: But now according to his Saying, he was rowled with Infamy into the Grave; which may serve indeed for a remarkable Instance of the Justice and equal Judgments of God.</P>
<P>About this Time a Book came out at <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Popish Book call'd <HI>Semper Idem</HI> publish∣ed and sold publickly at <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> bearing the Title of <HI>Semper idem, [i. e. Always the same,]</HI> or a Parallel of Phanaticks. The Author concealed his Name; but he made it appear sufficiently that he was a Papist, and it may be a Jesuit: For he inveighed not only a∣gainst the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Baptists,</HI> but also against the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and even <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> and consequently against all Protestants: Nay the Mar∣tyrs that were burnt in the bloody Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> eldest Daugh∣ter to King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, were no less vilified than the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the said Book, by the scornful Name of Rebels and Phanaticks. This Book was sold publickly, and it seemed that none durst oppose it, for Fear of displeasing the Court. But <HI>E. Burroughs,</HI> who was of an undaun∣ted Courage, and so continued till his Death, imployed his Pen to re∣fute it, and gave forth his Answer in Print *,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intitled <HI>Persecution impeach'd,</HI> &amp;c.

with Calumnies, had not been seen at <HI>London</HI> for above an hun∣dred Years; and all the groundless Positions of the said Author, were very notably answered by the said <HI>E. Burroughs.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See his Works, p. 850. <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> writes a Book against Perse∣cution.</NOTE> And since Persecu∣tion in the latter End of this Year began to appear with open Face a∣gain, he published a Book which he called, <HI>Antichrist's Government justly detected.</HI> This he dedicated to all the Rulers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the (so called) Christian World, and therein with sound Arguments mani∣fested the Unlawfulness and Injustice of Persecution, and from whence it had its Rise; and how dangerous it was to impose a Religion. Next he treated at large concerning Heresy, and what Punishment pertained to such as are truly convicted of it. But lest any might think, that he was for opposing the Duty of the Civil Magistrate against Malefactors, he said, concerning the Punishment of Heresy, (which he stated to be only an Ecclesiastical Censure) <HI>that he only intended this, where the Error of a Man and his Heresy in his Mind and Judgment did only extend to the Hurt of his own Soul, and against God, and not to the Harm of his Neighbour's Person or Estate. But</HI> (thus continued he) <HI>if his Error and Heresy do extend farther than only against God, and his own Soul, even to outward Wrongs, or Evils, or Violence, or visible Mischiefs be committed, as Murders, or other the like Crimes against Men, to the injuring of others, then I forbid not outward external Punish∣ment to be corporally inflicted upon the Person and Estate of such a Man; but it ought to be done, and that by the Laws of Men, provided for the same End; even such a Man's Error in such his wrong Dealing, may justly and lawfully be punished with Death, Banishment, or Penalties, according to the Desert of the Crime,</HI> &amp;c. The Author also writ circumstanstially concerning the Government of An∣tichrist, and shewed the Deceit that was in it, and who were the Sub∣jects of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>It was somewhat before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> jun. writes to the King against P.pery.</NOTE> that <HI>George Fox</HI> the Younger, be∣ing a Prisoner, and seeing an Intent of promoting Popery, writ the fol∣lowing Letter to the King.</P>

O Friend, when I beheld the <HI>Wickedness, Cruelty</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> that a∣bound in this Nation in <HI>open View,</HI> and also the <HI>secret Abominations</HI> which are committed, and are plotting and lurking in the Chambers; verily my Life is even bowed down became of the <HI>fierce Wrath of the Almigh∣ty</HI> which I see is <HI>kindled,</HI> and because of the <HI>great Destruction,</HI> which I see <HI>attends the Wicked,</HI> whose Ends and Counsels the Lord will frustrate, and upon whom he will pour out everlasting <HI>Contempt,</HI> yea, and it hath been oft in me before thou camest last into the Land, and also since, even when it hath been shewn me, what <HI>Idolatry</HI> is in∣tended <HI>in secret</HI> to be brought in, that certainly it had been better for thee that thou hadst never come; for I have seen it tending to thy <HI>Destruction:</HI> And when I have seen the <HI>Abomination</HI> and <HI>Cruelties</HI> which are committed and intended, there hath a <HI>Pity</HI> arose in me towards thee for thy Soul's Sake, and it hath been my Desire, if it might stand with the Will of God, that he would put it into thy Heart <HI>to go out of the Land again,</HI> that so thy <HI>Life might be preserved,</HI> and that thou mightest <HI>have Time to repent;</HI> for tho many Men flatter and applaud thee for self Ends, yet I see the Lord is <HI>displeased</HI> with thy Ways. Let no Man deceive thee by <HI>feigned Words; God will not be mocked; such as thou sowest, such must thou reap</HI> Thou canst not hide thy self from the Lord, nor deliver thy self from the <HI>Stroke of his Hand.</HI> O consider, how soon hath the Lord taken away thy Brother, who according to outward Appearance might have lived longer than thou! O, think not that Men can preserve thee, tho' all the Nations about promise to help thee! yet when the Lord appears against thee, <HI>Thou must fall,</HI> verily there is a <HI>great Desolation</HI> near, thy <HI>Hand cannot stay it;</HI> God hath decreed that he may exalt his <HI>own Kingdom:</HI> The Nations are like a <HI>boyling Pot,</HI> a little Flame will set them on Fire; and the <HI>windy Doc∣trine</HI> of the <HI>Priests</HI> shall help to kindle it. Oh the Day will be <HI>terri∣ble,</HI> who may abide it? The <HI>Stubble</HI> will be consumed, and the Chast shall be <HI>burned;</HI> the <HI>Ʋngodly</HI> shall be abased, for they cannot stand in <HI>Judgment;</HI> but the Seed shall be <HI>exalted.</HI> O what shall I say that might be for thy Safety! verily I can say little, the Lord's Decree <HI>must stand,</HI> the Lord <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> highly displeased,</HI> and his Wrath <HI>is near</HI> to be revealed: And he is <HI>swift</HI> in his Goings, and he will <HI>shorten the Days of his Ene∣mies</HI> for his <HI>Elect sake.</HI> O that thy Soul might be saved in the Day of the Lord! my Spirit is in suffering for thee, my Soul is ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icted with∣in me because of the <HI>Approaching</HI> of the Day of thy Calamity, from which no Man can deliver thee.

</LETTER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Y.</HI> resents and advises to Severity against the Author, with the King's n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble Return. <HI>G. Fox</HI> jun. writes against the Abomina∣tions of the Times, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retels some Things.</NOTE> This Letter, (a clear Evidence of the Author's Magnanimity) was delivered to the King, who read it and seemed to be reach'd thereby, and touch'd at Heart: But his Brother the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was displea∣sed with it, and being violently set against the Author, advised the King to use Severity towards him; but the King being good-natured, said, <HI>It were better for us to mend our Lives.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst the said <HI>G. Fox</HI> was Prisoner in <HI>Lambeth</HI> House, he writ also a small Treatise, called, <HI>England's sad Estate and Condition lamented.</HI> <Q>Herein he reproved the grievous Abominations committed among the Inhabitants Oppression by Persecution, and the Hypocrisy of the Priests. He also predicted the Pestilence, as may be mentioned here∣after in due Place; and signified not obscurely that Endeavours would be used publickly to introduce Superstition and Idolatry: But that those who intended to do so, should be frustrated by the Lord in their Attempts. And that others, whose Worship also did displease the Lord, should grind and waste one another: But that beyond their Expectation he would pluck out from them, and preserve a holy Seed. And that after he should have executed his Vengeance upon the rebellious and treacherous Dealers, he would then bring forth the Remnant of his holy Seed, which should be preserved from their Fury, and then they shall spread over all, and stand in Dominion.</Q> <HI>But,</HI> thus continued he, <HI>Altho' these Things, touching the holy Remnant, shall certainly be fulfilled in their Season, yet before they will be fully accomplished, great will be the Tryals of many of the Righteous, and there will be great Judg∣ments executed in thee, 0 Land, by him who oftimes makes a fruitful Land barren because of the Wickedness of them that dwell therein.</HI> This and much more he writ, and publish'd it in Print. Several of his Predictions we have seen fulfilled, as in the Progress of this History may appear: And this last we must refer to Time. After the Writing of this Treatise, he also gave forth the following Prayer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Prayer.</NOTE> <HI>Surely it was thou, O Lord, that gave Bounds unto the Sea, that the Floods thereof could not overwhelm thy Chosen: Thou canst let forth the Winds, and suf∣fer a Storm, and thou canst make a Calm when thou pleasest. Have thou the Glory of all, thou King of Saints, thou Saviour of</HI> Israel. <HI>Thou canst do what∣ever thou pleasest, therefore will we trust in thy Name, neither will we fear what Man can do unto us, because thou wilt not forsake us; but thou wilt plead our Cause in the Sight of our Adversaries, and they shall know that thou art our God, who art able to save to the uttermost. O Lord our Righteousness, we will praise thy Name; for thy Mercies endure for ever. Our Eyes, O God, are un∣to thee, for we have no other Helper. Our Faith, O Lord, standeth in thee, who canst not forget thy People. Thou hast revealed and brought up <HI>Jacob,</HI> who wrestleth with thee, and prevails as a Prince, therefore must the Blessing come. O Lord, the Birth, the Birth, cryeth unto thee, thine own Elect which long hath been oppressed. Thou canst not deny thy self, therefore have we Faith, and Hope which maketh not ashamed. Oh Lord, how unsearchable are thy Ways! Thou hast even amazed thy People with the Depth of thy Wisdom; thou alone wilt have the Glory of their Deliverance; and therefore hast thou suffered these Things to come to pass. O Lord, thou art righteous in all thy Judgments: Only pre∣serve thy People, which thou hast gathered, and wilt gather unto thy self, in the Day of Tryal; that so they may sing of thy Power, and magnify thy Name in the Land of the Living.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="003104_0290_0FEFF594AE042E90"/>This <HI>G. Fox</HI> writ also, in Prison, several other Papers and Epistles, for Exhortation and Consolation of his Friends:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Paper to the Heads of the Nation, exhorting to Justice, and manifesting his resignation and Courage.</NOTE> But his Work was soon done, so that not long after he departed this Life, which was in this, or the next Year. He was as may be seen from his Writings, a Man of extraordinary Resignation and Courage; and that he gave up his Life, if required, may appear from a small Book he writ, being Prisoner in <HI>Lambeth</HI> House, which he called, <HI>The Dread of God's Power, uttering its Voice thro' Man, unto the Heads of the Nation.</HI> Herein he exhorted the Rulers very earnestly to do Justice; and said among the rest; <HI>Friends, I must deal plainly with you in the Sight of God, who hath made me a Prophet to the Nation. I may not flatter any of you. My Life is in the Hand of my Maker, and not one Hair of my Head can fall to the Ground without his Provi∣dence. He hath redeemed my Soul from Hell, and my Mind from the Earth; and he hath given me his good Spirit to lead me. I am henceforth no more my own, but I am the Lord's, who hath formed me to his Praise, and hath brought me forth, that I may sound forth his powerful Truth amongst the People. There∣fore must I not fear Man, neither must I be afraid of the Sons of Men.</HI></P>
<P>Thus undaunted he shew'd himself. But it was not long before he made his Exit, of which I can't but say something. In his Sickness I find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Beha∣viour in his last Sickness, and at his Death.</NOTE> that tho' he was weak in Body, yet he was strong in Spirit, so that he would even sing for Joy of Heart. He exhorted his Friends <HI>to keep in Ʋnity,</HI> foreseeing (it may be) that something would rise which might give Occasion of Division: And then with much Fervency of Spirit, he prayed God, and exhorted his Friends <HI>to keep their Garments unspotted of the World, because great was the Day of Trial that was at Hand.</HI> Afterwards recommending them to the Lord, he took his Leave of them, and slept in perfect Peace with the Lord, being of sound Me∣mory to the last. Now the Dust was returned to the Earth, and the Spirit unto God who gave it. Thus he was freed of all Danger of lo∣sing the Crown of immortal Life, which Man by Temptation, and the Casualties of this Life is liable unto, if he continueth not diligent∣ly watchful. But this Valiant Man was now beyond the Reach of all Temptations, and so I leave him, that I may pass on to other Matters.</P>
<P>In this Year <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> writ a Paper to the King and his Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> writes to the King and Council of Friends Refu∣sal to take the Oath of Alle∣giance.</NOTE> which he called, <HI>A just and righteous Plea,</HI> in which he proposed at large the Reasons why the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> refused to take the Oath of Allegiance, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was not because they would not be faithful to the King, but only for Conscience-sake, since Christ so ex∣presly had commanded his Followers, <HI>Swear not at all,</HI> which Command they durst not transgress. Yet to assure the Government of their Faith∣fulness, he said thus;
<HI>We now are and shall be faithful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Principles of Friends re∣lating to Go∣vernment and Governors.</NOTE> innocent, and peaceable in our several Stations and Conditions, under this present Government of King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId. whom we acknowledge supreme Magistrate and Governor over this Kingdom, and for Conscience-sake we are obedient and submissive to him, as such, in all his Com∣mands, either by doing and performing of what he justly requireth, or by patient Suffering under whatsoever is inflicted upon us, in the Matters-for which we can∣not be obedient for Conscience-sake, when any Thing is required of us different from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe just Law of God: And to this Subjection, to the King and his Govern∣ment, we are bound by the Law of Righteousness; and such hath ever been our Principle and Practice, and is unto this Day, even to be quiet, and peaceable, and patient under every Authority that is set over us; and not in Ʋnrighteousness, to plot, or contrive, or rebel against any Government or Governors, nor to seek our own Deliverance from Injustice and Oppression in such a Way. And we are persuaded to seek the Preservation of the King's Person and Authority by all just and lawful Means, and not to rebel against him with carnal Weapons; and so
<PB N="280" REF="003104_0291_0FEFF5D9C9E47498"/>
far as his Government is in Justice, Mercy, and Righteousness, we declare true and faithful Subjection and Obedience thereunto; and wherein it is otherwise, we shall be subject by patient Suffering what is unequally imposed upon us, and yet not rebel in any tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent Way of Conspiracies and Insurrections: For our Principles are not for War, but for Peace with all Men so much as in us lies; neither may we render Evil for Evil to any, but are to be subject to the King and his Government, actively or passively, upon the Conditions afore-mentioned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we renounce all foreign Authority, Power, and Jurisdiction of the Pope, or any else, from having any Supremacy whatsoever over the King, or any the good Subjects of <HI>England.</HI> And this we declare, acknowledge, and testify, in the Fear and Presence of God, (to whom we and all Mankind must give an Account) and that without secret Equivocation, or any deceitful mental Reservation.</HI></P>
<P>Thus fully <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> declared himself, and gave also a circum∣stancial Relation of the Practice of his Friends meeting together, or their Way of publick Worship, thereby to assure the Government of their peaceable Behaviour, and Fidelity. But all this proved in vain; for it being well known that the <HI>Quakers</HI> denied swearing, they conti∣nually were vexed and persecuted, under a Pretence of not giving due Satisfaction of their being faithful to the Government, and so transgres∣sing the Laws.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deputies from <HI>New-England</HI> came to <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> Now the Deputies of <HI>New-England</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> and endeavoured to clear themselves as much as possible, but especially Priest <HI>Norton,</HI> who bowed no less reverently before the Archbishop, than before the King; and thus fawning upon the <HI>Episcopalians,</HI> they found Means to keep in a Condition to vex the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, tho' they were for∣bidden to put them to Death: And that many of the Bishops were great Enemies to the said <HI>Quakers,</HI> appear'd plainly from the cruel Persecu∣tion, which after a short Calm, arose again in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest <HI>Norton</HI> endeavours to acquit himself from assisting in bloody Tri∣als, but is op∣posed by <HI>J. Copeland.</HI></NOTE> But to return to the <HI>New-England</HI> Deputies, they would fain have altogether excused themselves; and Priest <HI>Norton</HI> thought it sufficient to say, That he did not assist in the blooy Trial, nor had advised to it: But <HI>John Copeland,</HI> whose Ear was cut off at <HI>Boston,</HI> charged the con∣trary upon him: And <HI>G. Fox,</HI> the Elder, got Occasion to speak with them in the Presence of some of his Friends, and asked <HI>Simon Broadstreet,</HI> one of the <HI>New-England</HI> Magistrates, <HI>Whether he had not a Hand in putting to Death those they nick-named</HI> Quakers? He not being able to deny this, confessed he had. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked him and his Associates that were present, <HI>Whether they would acknowledge themselves to be Subjects to the Laws of</HI> England? <HI>And if they did, by what Law they had put his Friends to Death?</HI> They answered, <HI>They were Subjects to the Laws of</HI> England, <HI>and they had put his Friends to Death by the same Law, as the Jesuits were put to Death in</HI> England. Hereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked, <HI>Whether they did believe that those his Friends, whom they had put to Death, were Jesuits, or Jesuitical∣ly affected?</HI> They said, <HI>Nay. Then,</HI> replied <HI>G. Fox, Ye have murdered them; for since ye put them to Death by the Law that Jesuits are put to Death here in</HI> England, <HI>it plainly appears, you have put them to Death arbitrarily, without any Law.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> proves <HI>Broadstreet,</HI> and Associates guilty of Mur∣der by their own Words, which makes them flinch; so they leave the City, and get back to <HI>N. England.</HI></NOTE> Thus <HI>Broadstreet</HI> finding himself and his Company en∣snar'd by their own Words, ask'd, <HI>Are you come to catch us? <HI>But he told them,</HI> They had catch'd themselves, and they might justly be questioned for their Lives; and if the Father of</HI> William Robinson (one of those that were put to Death) <HI>were in Town, it was probable he would question them, and bring their Lives into Jeopardy:</HI> For he not being of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Persua∣sion, would perhaps not have so much Regard to the Point of Forbea∣rance, as they had. <HI>Broadstreet,</HI> seeing himself thus in Danger, began to flinch and to sculk; for some of the Old Royalists were earnest with the <HI>Quakers</HI> to prosecute the <HI>New-England</HI> Persecutors. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> and
<PB N="281" REF="003104_0292_0FEFF5984F925BD0"/>
his Friends said, <HI>They left them to the Lord, to whom Vengeance belonged, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld repay it. Broadstreat</HI> however, not thinking it safe to stay in <HI>England,</HI> lest the City, and with his Companions went back again to <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Not long before this Time, <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> &amp; published the Book call'd <HI>A Battledoor</HI> chiefly compi∣led by <HI>John Stubs</HI> and <HI>Benj.

This Work was p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>oted to publick View by <HI>G. Fox,</HI> to shew the Learned, (if possible to convince them) that the Custom of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> to say <HI>Thou</HI> to a single Person, tho it were to the King, and not <HI>You,</HI> was not irre∣gular nor absurd, but had been used anciently; and that therefore they could not justly be charged with Unmannerliness, because they followed not the common Custom, which was crept in by the Pride of Man. Now tho' G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. Crou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e doth disapprove in <HI>G.

Fox</HI> was a great Promoter of that Work; and tho' he was not skill'd in Languages, and some were for calling him an Idiot or a Fool, yet I know him to have been a Man of good Understanding, and of deep Judgment. In his Journal he freely owns, that <HI>John Stubs</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Furly</HI> took great Pains in the com∣piling of the said Book, which he put them upon, and added also some Things to it; so that in some Respect he might be esteem'd Author too.

<P>This Book (in which <HI>J. Stubs</HI> and <HI>B.

The King confess'd, that the Distinction be∣tween <HI>Plural</HI> and <HI>Singular,</HI> in Regard of Persons, was <HI>the proper Language of all Nations;</HI> and the Archbishop being ask'd what he thought of it, was so at a Stand, that he could not tell what to say to it; for it ap∣pears, he would not commend it, neither could he resolve to disapprove it. Yet it did so inform and convince People, that many afterward were not near so much offended at saying <HI>Tuou</HI> and <HI>Thee</HI> to a single Per∣son, as they were before.</P>
<P>Now many Papists and Jesuits began to fawn upon those called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Papists</HI> fawn on <HI>Quakers</HI> in H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pes to Pro∣selyte some.</NOTE> and said publickly, That: <HI>of all the Sects, the</HI> Quakers <HI>were the best, and most self-denying People; and that it was great Pity that they did not return to Holy Mother Church.</HI> And tho' they might have been in Hopes there∣by to have gained Proselytes from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet they were disap∣pointed. In the mean while they did but ill Service to the <HI>Quakers</HI> thereby;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And some Je∣suits desiring to have Dis∣course with them, <HI>G.

Fox</HI> consented to it, and in Order thereunto, Time and Place were appointed: Whereupon two of the <HI>Loyalists</HI> came, being drest like Cour∣tiers, and they asked the Names of <HI>G.

then asked them the same Question, he had once before (as hath been said already) asked a Jesuit, viz. <HI>Whether the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>was not degenerated from the Church in the primitive Times; from the Spirit, and Pow∣er, and Practice that they were in in the Apostles Time,</HI> The Jesuit, to whom the Question was put, laid, <HI>He would not answer it, G. Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>Why?</HI> But he would give no Reason. His Companion then said, <HI>They were not degenerated from the Church in the primitive Times.</HI> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked the other <HI>Whether he was of the same Mind?</HI> And he said, <HI>Yes. G. Fox,</HI> to give no Room to any Excuses of a Mistake, repeated his Que∣stion thus; <HI>Whether the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>was now in the same Purity, Practice Power, and Spirit, that the Church in the Apostles Time was in.</HI> The Jesuits seeing how exact <HI>G. Fox</HI> would be with them, said, <HI>It was Presumption in any to say, they had the same Power and Spirit which the Apostles had</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> told them, <HI>It was Presumption in them to meddle with the Words of Christ and his Apostles, and make People believe they succeeded the Apostles, and yet be forced to confess, they were not in the same Power and Spirit, that the A∣postles were in: This,</HI> said he, <HI>is a Spirit of Presumption, and rebuked by the Apostles Spirit.</HI> Thereupon he shewed them, how different their Fruits and Practices were from the Fruits and Practices of the Apostles. This so displeased the Jesuits, that one of them said, <HI>Ye are a Company of Dream∣ers. Nay,</HI> said <HI>G. Fox, Ye are the Dreamers, who dream ye are the Apostles Successors, and yet confess, ye have not the same Power and Spirit which the A∣postles were in.</HI> Then he began to tell them also, <Q>How they were led by an evil Spirit; and that this Spirit had induced them to pray by Beads, and to Images, and to put People to Death for Religion.</Q> He spoke yet more; but the Jesuits soon grew weary of this Discourse, and went away, giving Charge afterwards to those of their Persuasion, not to dispute with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> nor to read any of their Books.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> has large Meet∣ings at <HI>Col∣chester,</HI> then<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e he goes to <HI>Coggeshal,</HI> near which he has a Meeting at the House of a Priest that was con∣vinced, and returns to <HI>London</HI> soon after. Some farther Account of <HI>J. Perrot.</HI></NOTE> Some Time after <HI>G. Fox</HI> went <HI>to Colchester,</HI> where he had very large Meetings. From thence he went to <HI>Coggeshall;</HI> not far from which there was a Priest convinc'd of the Truth of the Doctrine held forth by him and his Friends; and he had a Meeting in his House. And after having visited his Friends in their Meetings thereabouts, he returned to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> where he found more Work.</P>
<P>For <HI>John Perrot,</HI> of whom Mention hath been made already that he was at <HI>Rome,</HI> had so far complied with his vain Imaginations, that he thought himself farther enlightned than <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Friends; and from this Presumption he would not approve, that when any one pray∣ed in a Meeting, others should put off their Hats, calling this a Forma∣lity, and a common Custom of the World, which ought to be departed from. And since Novelties often draw People after them, so it was in this Case, insomuch that he got pretty many Adherents. But he did not stand here; for as one Error proceeds from another, so he made ano∣ther extravagant Step, and let his Beard grow; in which he was fol∣lowed by some. In the mean while <HI>G. Fox</HI> labour'd both by Word and Writing, to stop his Progress: And tho' most of his Friends also bore a Testimony against it, yet there passed several Years before this strange Fire was altogether extinguished, to the quenching whereof it contribu∣ted not a little that <HI>Perrot,</HI> who now walked in an erroneous Path, grew worse from Time to Time, even to that Degree, that being come into <HI>America,</HI> he fell into manifest Sensualities, and Works of the Flesh: For he not only wore gaudy Apparel, but also a Sword; and being got into some Place in the Government, he became a severe Exactor of Oaths, whereas before he had professd that for Conscience-sake he could not swear. Before I leave <HI>Perrot,</HI> I'll insert here a Letter writ by him, from <HI>Rome,</HI> when he was released from Prison: And tho' I be∣lieve he was then in a better State than afterward, yet in that Letter
<PB N="283" REF="003104_0294_0FEFF59B99AD1308"/>
some Sparks of spiritual Pride may be seen, which tho' then under some Limitation, yet in Process of Time so broke forth, that it caused his Fall. The Letter was thus:</P>

<P>He added not his Sir-name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Omits his Sir-Name.</NOTE> in Imitation (as it seems) of the Apostle <HI>John.</HI> He omitted it likewise in another Letter he writ from the Prison at <HI>Rome,</HI> which began thus;</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> John <HI>the Prisoner, being in the Sense of the Spirit of Life with you all,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Who were the two Lambs he mentions in his Letter, I can't tell; whether they were Persons that had been imprisoned with him in the Inquisition Jail, and converted by him as he thought; or whether he meant <HI>John Stubs</HI> and <HI>Samuel Fisher,</HI> I know not; it may rather be sup∣posed he meant <HI>Charles Bayley</HI> and <HI>Jane Stoakes</HI> who went to <HI>Rome</HI> to procure his Liberty; but <HI>J. Stubs</HI> and <HI>S. Fisher</HI> came away long before; yet if I am not mistaken, it was about this Time that these were at <HI>Rome,</HI> and they perhaps having endeavoured to obtain his Liberty, de∣parted before him towards <HI>England,</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Perrot</HI> afterward lived in <HI>America,</HI> about the Beginning of the Year 1665, <HI>John Taylor</HI> writ thus from <HI>Jamaica</HI> concerning him.</P>
<P><Q>One of the Judges of this Place told me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter from <HI>Jamaica</HI> con∣cerning him.</NOTE> that he never had seen, one who so severely exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted an Oath from People as <HI>John Perrot</HI> did: For he saith, that if they will go to Hell, he will dispatch them quickly. And another Judge that was also present, said, that <HI>Perrot</HI> had altogether renounced his Faith, and aim'd at nothing but his Profit.</Q></P>
<P>Such a one was <HI>John Perrot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Rich</HI> joins with <HI>Perrot,</HI> and both quit their former Profession.</NOTE> tho' even some wise Men admired him for a Time; but he became a Man of a rough Behaviour. Whether he ever repented sincerely, I can't tell. <HI>Robert Rich,</HI> who took too much Part in the Extravagancies of <HI>James Naylor,</HI> as hath been related, did also combine with <HI>Perrot,</HI> and became estranged from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and in that Condition he died: But he was of the Number of those, of whom the Apostle <HI>John</HI> said, <HI>They went out from us, but they were not of us.</HI></P>
<P>Now since Persecution continued in <HI>England,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> writes to the King and Par∣liament a∣gainst Perse∣cution for Religion</NOTE> Edward Burroughs,</HI> who continually was laborious with the Pen to oppose this Evil, writ also a small Book which he called, <HI>The Case of free Liberty of Conscience in the Ex∣ercise of Faith and Religion, presented unto the King and both Houses of Par∣liament.</HI> In this Treatise he shew'd, <Q>That to deprive honest and peace∣able People of Liberty of Conscience in the Exercise of Worship to God was unjust, an Intrenching on God's Soveraignty, and an Usur∣pation of his Authority. He also recommended it to Consideration, that to impose by Force a Religion upon Men, was the Way to fill the Land with Hypocrites. And he shewed with sound Reasons, that to persecute People for the Exercise of Religion and their Worship∣ping of God, must unavoidably tend to destroy Trading, Husbandry, and Merchandise.</Q> To which he added, that such as were called Hereticks were punished as Malefactors, whereas Drunkards and other vi∣cious
<PB N="284" REF="003104_0295_0FEFF5DFD7B2D560"/>
Persons were left unpunished; which to inculcate with more Strength,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarkable Expressions of Bishop <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Tay∣lor.</HI></NOTE> he made use of the Words of Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> a Bishop in <HI>Ireland</HI> who said thus: <HI>Why are we so zealous against those we call Hereticks, and yet great Friends with Drunkards, and Swearers, and Fornicators, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣rate and idle Persons? I am certain a Drunkard is as contrary to the Laws of Christianity as an Heretick: And I am also sure that I know what Dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ss is; but I am not so sure that such an Opinion is Heresy,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It happened about this Time in <HI>England,</HI> that some covetous Persons, to engross Inheritances to themselves, would call the Marriages of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> in Question.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emarl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Trial of a <HI>Quakers</HI> Marriage at <HI>Nottingham.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her.</NOTE> And it was in this Year that such a Cause was tried at the Assizes at <HI>Nottingham;</HI> a certain Man dying, and leaving his Wife with Child, and an Estate in Copyhold Lands: When the Wo∣man was delivered, one that was near of Kin to her deceased Husband, endeavoured to prove the Child illegitimate: And the Plaintiff's Coun∣cil willing to blacken the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, asserted <HI>The Child to be il∣legitimate, because the Marriage of its Parents was not according to Law;</HI> and said bluntly, and very indecently, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>went together like brute Beasts.</HI> After the Council on both Sides had pleaded, the Judge, whose Name was — <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cher,</HI> opened the Case to the Jury, and told them, <HI>That there was a Marriage in Paradise, when</HI> Adam <HI>took</HI> Eve, <HI>and</HI> Eve <HI>took</HI> Adam; <HI>and that it was the Consent of the Parties that made a Marriage. And as for the</HI> Quakers, (said he) <HI>he did not know their Opinion; but he did not believe they went together as brute Beasts, as had been said of them, but as Christians; and therefore he did believe the Marriage was lawful, and the Child, lawful Heir.</HI> And the better to satisfy the Jury, he related to them this Case. <HI>A Man that was weak of Body, and kept his Bed, had a Desire in that Condition to marry, and did declare before Witnesses, that he did take such a Wo∣man, to be his Wife; and the Woman declared, that she took that Man to be her Husband. This Marriage was afterwards called in Question: But all the Bishops did at that Time conclude it to be a lawful Marriage.</HI> The Jury having re∣ceived this Instruction, gave in their Verdict for the Child, and decla∣red it legitimate.</P>
<P>It hath been mentioned before, that <HI>G. Fox</HI> being Prisoner at <HI>Darby</HI> in the Year 1650, was exceedingly vexed and ill treated by the Keeper of the Prison. But this Man being struck with the Terrors of the Lord, became such a notable Convert, that in the Year 1662 he wrote the following Letter to <HI>G. Fox</HI></P>

I have heretofore made some Mention of the Imprisonment of <HI>Kathe∣rine Evans</HI> and <HI>Sarah Cheevers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The History of the Imprison∣ment of <HI>K. Evans</HI> and <HI>S. Cheevers,</HI> by the Inquisition at <HI>Malta,</HI> and their Deli∣very.</NOTE> by the Inquisition at <HI>Malta.</HI> It was a∣bout this Time that they were released: For <HI>G. Fox</HI> having understood that the Lord <HI>d' Aubery</HI> could procure their Liberty, went to him, and having informed him concerning their Imprisonment, desired him to write to those in Authority at <HI>Malta,</HI> for their Release. This he pro∣mised to do, and told <HI>G. Fox,</HI> if he would come again within a Month, perhaps he might hear of their Discharge. <HI>G. Fox</HI> went again to him about that Time, but he said, he thought his Letters had miscarried; yet he promised he would write again, and so he did; which was of such Effect, that the said two Women were discharged of their long Imprisonment. <HI>G. Fox</HI> had now Opportunity to reason with this Lord, who was a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> about Religion, and he brought him to con∣fess, <Q>That Christ had enlightned every Man that cometh into the World, with his Spiritual Light; and that he had tasted Death for every Man; and that the Grace of God, which brings Salvation, hath appeared to all Men; and that it would teach them, and bring their Salvation, if they did obey it.</Q> Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>What the</HI> Ro∣manists <HI>would do with all their Relicks and Images, if they did own and believe in this Light and receive the Grace to teach them, and bring their Salva∣tion?</HI> And he answered, <HI>Those Things were but Policies to keep People in Subjection.</HI></P>
<P>But leaving these Discourses, I'll now give a clear and circumstantial Relation of the Imprisonment of the fore-mentioned <HI>Katherine Evans</HI> and <HI>Sarah Cheevers,</HI> chiefly collected from Letters and Papers, written by them in Prison, and sent from thence to <HI>England,</HI> where they were pub∣lished in Print not long after their Return, in the Year, 1662.</P>
<P>In the Year 1658, these Women having Drawings in their Mind to travel toward <HI>Alexandria,</HI> went with a Ship from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Leghorn</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> and having been thirty one Days between <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Leghorn,</HI> they at length safely landed at that City, where they found some of their Countrymen and Friends, and staid there several Days, dispersing ma∣ny Books when Occasion offered. They spoke also with People of va∣rious Degrees, without being molested by any. From thence they got Passage in a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship bound for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> or <HI>Scanderoon;</HI> but the Master of the Ship, being in Company with another Ship going to <HI>Mal∣ta,</HI> went also thither, tho' he had no Business in the Place: But before they came there, <HI>Katherine</HI> fell into such an Anguish of Mind, that she cry'd out, <HI>Oh, we have a dreadful Cup to drink at that Place!</HI> Being come into the Harbour, and standing on the Deck of the Ship, and looking upon the People who stood on the Walls, she said in her Heart, <HI>Shall ye destroy us? If we give up to the Lord, then he is sufficient to deliver us out of your Hands: But if we disobey our God, all these could not deliver us out of his Hand.</HI> And so all Fear of Man was taken from them. The next Day, being the first Day of the Week, they went on Shore, where the <HI>English</HI> Consul met them, and asked them, <HI>What they came there for?</HI> They answered what they thought convenient, and gave him some Books. Then he told them, <HI>There was an Inquisition;</HI> and kindly invi∣ting them to his House, said, <HI>All that he had was at their Service while they were there.</HI> They accepting, of this Invitation, went thither, and many came to see them, whom they called to Repentance, so that se∣veral became tender. About Night they went on Ship-board, and the next Day came again into the City, and going to the Governor, he told them he had a Sister in the Nunnery who desired to see them. Thereupon they went to the Nunnery, and talked with the Nuns, and gave them Books: And one of their Priests, who brought them into the Chappel, would have them bow to the High Altar: But
<PB N="286" REF="003104_0297_0FEFF5E2CF4EBB50"/>
they refused, being grieved because of the Idolatry committed there, and went to the Consul's again, where they staid some Weeks. During that Time, they once went into one of the Places of Worship, in the Time of Worship; and <HI>Katharine</HI> standing in the midst of the People, turned her Back to the High Altar, and kneeling down, she lifted up her Voice in Prayer to the Lord. The Priest that officiated, put off his Surplice, and kneeled near her, till she had done. Then he reach∣ed forth his Hand to them to come to him, and offered her a Token, which she taking to be the Mark of the Beast, refused. Thereupon he put the Piece into <HI>Sarah</HI>'s Hand, but she gave it him again, and shewed him her Purse, that she had to give, if any had Need, and as yet was in no Want, He then ask'd, <HI>If they were</HI> Calvinists <HI>or</HI> Lutherans? And they answering, <HI>Nay;</HI> he ask d, <HI>If they would go to</HI> Rome <HI>to the Pope.</HI> They denying this, he ask'd, <HI>If they were</HI> Catholicks? To which they said, <HI>They were true Christians, Servants of the living God.</HI> But since they had yet learned but little of the Language spoken there, they express'd themselves very defectively, which they did, partly in Words, and partly by Signs, as well as they could: And many that came about them, were amazed: However at last they departed peaceably. Some Time after they went again to a Mass-house, where the Sacrament, as they call it, was administred: There were many Lights; and great Costliness and Fineries; and being grieved because of their Idolatry, they stood about three Quarters of an Hour, weeping and trembling, especially <HI>Katherine:</HI> And this so struck the Congregation with Amaze∣ment, that some removed farther from them for Fear. At length they both went out, but yet under such a Trembling, that they went along the Street reeling and staggering, so that they became a Wonder to all that saw them.</P>
<P>They were about three Months at the House of the <HI>English</HI> Consul; and he, by Reason of that, being under a Suspicion, did not what he might have done to save them; but in some Respect he delivered them up to the Inquisition, tho' by his Oath he was obliged to protect the <HI>English</HI> there. In the mean while he kept them in his House, and suffered them not to go abroad, tho' the Governor had told him, he might let them go about their Business; for said he, <HI>They are honest Wo∣men.</HI> The Consul might also have let them go free, before they came under the Power of the Black Rod. Now they perceiving that some∣thing to their Prejudice was in Agitation, and making Account un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> already that a Prison would be their Lot, they signified that they suspected him, and told him, <HI>That</HI> Pilate <HI>would do the</HI> Jews <HI>a Service, and yet wash his Hands in Innocency.</HI> He being at a Loss, required a Sign of them, if <HI>they were the Messengers of God.</HI> And they gave him to understand, that this might serve for a Sign; <HI>That it would be well with them; but that it should not go off well with him.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards it happened that they were sent for by the Inquisition: And that Day the Consul's Wife brought them some Victuals; but as she pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by, <HI>Katharine</HI> was smitten, as with an Arrow, to the Heart, and she seemed to hear a Voice, saying, <HI>She hath obtained her Purpose.</HI> Then <HI>Katharine</HI> would not taste of the Meat, but went aside, and wept exceedingly. The Consul having called her, told her, The Inquisition had sent for them, having received Letters from <HI>Rome,</HI> but that <HI>he did hope they should be set free:</HI> Which however was not true, for he knew (as they understood afterwards) there was a Room prepared for them in the Prison of the Inquisition. Neither was it long ere there came one with a Black Rod, and the Chancellor, and the Consul, who brought them before the Lord Inquisitor; and he asked them, <HI>Whether they had changed their Minds?</HI> (for it seems that had been required of
<PB N="287" REF="003104_0298_0FEFF5A02B852CA0"/>
them before.) But they answered, <HI>No,</HI> and <HI>that they should not change from the Truth.</HI> Then he ask'd; <HI>What new Light it was they talked of.</HI> They answered, <HI>It was no new Light, but the same the Prophets and Apostles bore Testimony to.</HI> Next he ask'd, <HI>How this Light came to be lost since the primitive Times?</HI> They reply'd, <HI>It was not lost; Men had it still in them, but they did not know it, by Reason that the Night of Apostacy had overspread the Nations.</HI> Then he said, <HI>If they would change their Minds, and do as they would have them, they should say so, or else they would use them as they pleased.</HI> But they signifying that they would not change, said, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> He then arose and went away with the Consul, leaving them there: And the Man with the Black Rod, and the Keep∣er, took and put them into an inner Room in the Inquisition, which had only two little Holes in it for Light or Air. This Place was so exceeding hot, that it seem'd as if their Intent was to stifle them, as we may see in the Sequel. Not long after they were brought before the Inquisitors to be farther examined, and they not only ask'd their Names, but also the Names of their Husbands and Parents, and what Children they had, and also why they came thither. To which they answered, <HI>They were Servants of the living God, being come there to call them to Repentance.</HI> The next Day they were called again, but then examin'd asunder; and <HI>Sarah</HI> being ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>Whether she was a true</HI> Catholick? said, <HI>That she was a true Christian, worshipping God in Spirit and Truth.</HI> Then they held forth a Crucifix to her, and would have her swear that she should speak the Truth. To which she said, <HI>She should speak the Truth, but she would not swear;</HI> for Christ had commanded, <HI>Swear not at all.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Consul who was present, endeavour'd to perswade her to swear, and said, That <HI>none should do her any Harm.</HI> She having some Books with her, they were taken from her; and they asked her, <HI>Wherefore she brought those Books?</HI> To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich she answered, <HI>Because they could not speak their Language</HI> Then they asked her, <HI>What</HI> George Fox <HI>was?</HI> She answered, <HI>A Minister.</HI> Farther they asked, <HI>Wherefore she came thither?</HI> And she replied, <HI>To do the Will of God as she was moved of the Lord.</HI> The next Question was, <HI>How the Lord did appear unto her?</HI> To which she answered, <HI>By his Spirit.</HI> And being asked, <HI>Whether she did see his Presence, and hear his Voice?</HI> Her Answer was, <HI>She heard his Voice, and saw his Presence.</HI> They then asked, <HI>What he said to her?</HI> She answerecd, That <HI>he required of her to go over the Seas to do his Will.</HI> This made them ask, <HI>How she knew it was the Lord who required this of her?</HI> To which she answered, That <HI>since he had signified to her, that his living Presence should go along with her, she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound him to perform his Promise, for she did feel his living Presence.</HI> After this they went away; and two Days after, the Inquisitors came and called for <HI>Katharine,</HI> and offering her the Cruci∣fix, they told her, <HI>The Magistrates commanded her, to swear that she should speak the Truth.</HI> To which she said, That <HI>she should speak the Truth, for she was a Witness for God; but she should not swear;</HI> since a greater than the Magistrates, said, <HI>Swear not at all; but let your Yea, be Yea, and your Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more, cometh of Evil.</HI> Then said they, <HI>You must obey the Justice, and he commands you to swear.</HI> She returned, <HI>I shall obey Justice, but if I should swear, I should do an unjust thing; for the just</HI> (Christ) <HI>said, Swear not at all.</HI> Then they asked her, <HI>Whether she did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Christ that died at</HI> Jerusalem? She answered, <HI>We own the same Christ, and no other; he is the same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever.</HI> Next they asked her, <HI>What she would do at</HI> Jerusalem? She answered, <HI>She did not know that she should go thither; but she intended to have gone to</HI> Alexan∣dria. They asked, <HI>What to do?</HI> Her Answer was, <HI>The Will of God: And,</HI> said she, <HI>if the Lord opened my Mouth, I should call People to Repentance, and declare to them the Day of the Lord, and direct their Minds from Darkness
<PB N="288" REF="003104_0299_0FEFF6DE31480EF0"/>
to Light.</HI> They asked her also, <HI>Whether she did see the Lord?</HI> She an∣swered, <HI>God was a Spirit, and he was spiritually discern'd.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' from the Answers of these Women, little could be got to blame them, yet they were kept close Prisoners, which seem'd to grieve the <HI>English</HI> Consul, for he came to them with Tears in his Eyes, and said, <HI>He was as sorry as for his own Flesh:</HI> For it seems he had received something for delivering them up, which he would willingly have gi∣ven back, if thereby he could have obtained their liberty; But a slavish Fear possess'd him, and he never had Peace while he lived. Some Days after, there came a Magistrate, two Friars, the Man with the Black Rod, a Scribe, and the Keeper of the Inquisition to examine them; and they were again required to swear: But they answered as before, that Christ said, <HI>Swear not at all;</HI> and that the Apostle <HI>James</HI> gave the same Charge. Hereupon the Magistrate asked, <HI>If they would speak Truth?</HI> And they said, <HI>Yes.</HI> He then asked, <HI>Whether they believed the Creed?</HI> To which they said, <HI>They did believe in God, and in Jesus Christ, who was born of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>and suffered at</HI> Jerusalem <HI>under</HI> Pon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and arose again from the Dead the third Day, and ascended to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shall come to Judgment, to judge both Quick and Dead. He far∣ther asked, <HI>How they did believe the Resurrection?</HI> And they answered, That <HI>they believed that the Just and the Ʋnjust should arise, according to the Scriptures.</HI> Next he said, <HI>Do ye believe in the Saints, and pray to them?</HI> To which their Answer was, <HI>We believe the Communion of Saints, but we do not pray to them, but to God only, in the Name of Jesus.</HI> His next Question was, <HI>Whether they did believe in the</HI> Catholick <HI>Church?</HI> And they answered, <HI>They did believe the true Church of Christ; but the Word,</HI> Catholick (said they) <HI>we have not read in Scripture.</HI> He also asked, <HI>If they believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Purgatory?</HI> To which they said, <HI>No; but a Heaven and a Hell.</HI> Then one or the Friars, who was an <HI>Englishman,</HI> said, <HI>We were commanded to pray for the Dead; for, those that are in Heaven have no Need; and for those that are in Hell, there is no Redemption; therefore there must be a Purgatory:</HI> And he asked, <HI>If they believed the holy Sacrament?</HI> To which their An∣swer was, <HI>They never read the Word</HI> Sacrament <HI>in Scripture.</HI> The Friar reply'd, <HI>Where you read in your Bibles,</HI> Sanctification, <HI>it is</HI> Sacrament <HI>in ours:</HI> And he said, <HI>Their holy Sacrament was Bread and Wine, which they converted into the Flesh and Blood of Christ, by the Virtue of Christ. Then,</HI> said the Women, <HI>Ye work Miracles; for Christ's Virtue is the same as it was when be turned Water into Wine at the Marriage in</HI> Cana. The Friar said, <HI>If we don't eat the Flesh, and drink the Blood of the Son of God, we have no Life in us.</HI> They reply'd, <HI>The Flesh and Blood of Christ is spiritual, and we do feed upon it daily; for that which is begotten of God in us, can no more live without spiritual Food, than our temporal Bodies can without temporal Food.</HI> Then he said, <HI>You never hear Mass. But we,</HI> said they, <HI>hear the Voice of</HI> Christ; <HI>he only hath the Words of eternal Life; and that is sufficient, for us.</HI> He said, <HI>Ye are Hereticks and Heathens.</HI> To which they reply'd, <HI>They are Hereticks that live in Sin and Wickedness, and such are Heathens that know not God.</HI> Then it was asked them, <HI>Who was the Head of their Church?</HI> They told him, <HI>Christ.</HI> It was farther ask'd, <HI>What</HI> George Fox <HI>was?</HI> And they said, <HI>He is a Minister of Christ.</HI> And it being ask'd, <HI>Whether he sent them?</HI> Their Answer was, <HI>No; the Lord did move us to come.</HI> Then the Friar said, <HI>Ye are deceived, and have not the Faith, tho' ye had all Virtues</HI> And they replied, <HI>Faith is the Ground from whence Virtues proceed.</HI> Hereupon it was told them, <HI>If they would take the Holy Sacrament, they might have their Liberty; or else the Pope would not leave them for Millions of Gold; but they should lose their Souls and Bodies too.</HI> To this they said, <HI>The Lord hath provided for our Souls, and our Bodies are freely given up to serve him.</HI> Then it was ask'd them, <HI>If
<PB N="289" REF="003104_0300_0FEFF622532BE1F8"/>
they did not believe Marriage was a Sacrament?</HI> And they answered, <HI>It was an Ordinance of God.</HI> It was farther ask'd, <HI>If they did believe Men could forgive Sins?</HI> And their Answer was, <HI>That none could forgive Sins but God only.</HI> After some other Words to and fro, the Women asked, <HI>Wherein have we wronged you, that we should be kept Prisoners all the Days of our Life? Our innocent Blood will be required at your Hands.</HI> The Friar said, <HI>He would take their Blood upon him.</HI> They replied, <HI>The Time would come he should find he had enough upon him without it.</HI> Then it was told them, <HI>The Pope was Christ's Vicar, and what he did was for the Good of their Souls.</HI> To this they answered, <HI>The Lord hath not committed the Charge of our Souls to the Pope, nor to you neither; for he hath taken them into his own Possession: Glory be to his Name for ever.</HI> Then it was said unto them, <HI>They must be obe∣dient.</HI> And they returned, <HI>They were obedient to the Government of Christ's Spirit, or Light.</HI> The Friar said, <HI>None have the true Light but the</HI> Catho∣licks: <HI>The Light that you have, is the Spirit of the Devil. Wo</HI> (said they) <HI>to him that curseth Jesus! Can the Devil give Power over Sin and Iniquity? That would destroy his own Kingdom. You</HI> (reply'd the Friar) <HI>are laugh'd at, and mock'd of every one. But,</HI> said they, <HI>What will become of the Mock∣ers? It was no Matter,</HI> he said: <HI>You run about to preach: and have not the true Faith.</HI> They return'd, <HI>The true Faith is held in a pure Conscience, void of Offence towards God and Men. Every one hath the true Faith, that believeth in God, and in Jesus Christ whom he hath sent: But they that say, they do be∣lieve, and do not keep his Commandments, are Liars, and the Truth is not in them.</HI> The Friar confess'd this to be true, tho' he was continually very troublesome to them with Threats, to make them turn; and to this End they were lock'd up in a Room so exceeding hot, that it was said, it was impossible they could live long in it. They were al∣so so exceedingly stung by G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ats, when they lay in Bed, that their Faces became swoln, as if they had been sick of the Small-Pox, so that many began to be afraid of them; and the Friar said to <HI>Sarah, He spi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d an evil Spirit in her Face.</HI></P>
<P>At another Time being examined, they were asked, <HI>How many of their Friends were gone forth in the Ministry, and into what Parts?</HI> They answering to that Query what they knew, it was told them, <HI>All that came where the Pope had any thing to do, should never go back again.</HI> But they said, <HI>The Lord was as sufficient for them, as he was for the Children in the fiery Furnace, and their Trust was in God. Katharine</HI> being sickly, was ask'd, <HI>Why she lookt so, whether her Spirit was weak?</HI> She answered, <HI>Nay, my Bo∣dy is weak, because I eat no Meat.</HI> The Friar hearing this, offered her a License to eat Flesh; for it was in their <HI>Lent.</HI> But she refused this, and said, <HI>She could not eat any thing at all.</HI> And going afterwards to Bed, she lay there Night and Day for twelve Days together, fasting and sweating, for she was in much Affliction, and great was her Agony.</P>
<P>After having lain Ten Days, there came to her two Friars, the Chan∣cellor, the Man with the Black Rod, a Physician, and the Keeper. One of the Friars commanded <HI>Sarah</HI> to go out of the Room, and then pull'd <HI>Katharine</HI>'s Hand out of the Bed, and said, <HI>Is the Devil so great in you, that you cannot speak?</HI> To which she said, <HI>Depart from me, thou Worker of Iniquity: The Power of the Lord is upon me, and dost thou call him Devil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Hereupon he took his Crucifix to strike her on the Mouth. And she asked him, <HI>Whether it were that Cross that crucified</HI> Paul <HI>to the World, and the World unto him?</HI> This ignorant Monk said, <HI>It was.</HI> But she denied it, and said, <HI>The Lord hath made me a witness for himself against all Workers of Iniquity.</HI> He then bid her, <HI>Be obedient,</HI> and went to strike her, at which she said,<HI>Wilt thou strike me?</HI> And he saying, <HI>he would;</HI> she further said, <HI>Thou art out of the Apostles Doctrine; for they were no Stri∣kers. I deny thee to be any of them who went in the Name of the Lord.</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="003104_0301_0FEFF5E513D312C0"/>
To which he said, <HI>He had brought her a Physician in Charity;</HI> and she re∣turned, <HI>The Lord is my Physician and my saving Health.</HI> The Monk growing angry, said, <HI>She should be whipt and quartered, and burnt that Night at</HI> Malta, <HI>and her Mate too.</HI> But she told him modestly, <HI>She did not fear; the Lord was on their Side: And he had no Power but what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> received: And if he did not use it to the same End the Lord gave it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would judge him.</HI> At these Words, they were all struck dumb, and went away. Then the Friar went to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and told her, <HI>that</HI> Katharine <HI>called him Worker of Iniquity. Did she</HI> said <HI>Sarah, Art thou without Sin?</HI> To which he said, <HI>he was. Then,</HI> replied <HI>Sarah, she hath wronged thee.</HI></P>
<P>Late in the Evening something was proclaimed at the Prison-Gate, by beating of a Drum, and early in the Morning some came again with a Drum and Guns. It seems to me that this was done on Purpose to frighten these poor Women, and to make them believe that they should be put to Death; for indeed they look'd for little less, having for se∣veral Weeks expected that they should be led to the Stake: But they were fully resigned, and given up to what the Lord might be pleased to permit. In the mean while, <HI>Katharine</HI> continuing sickly, the Friar came again with the Physician. But she told him, <HI>She could not take any Thing, unless she felt Freedom.</HI> He then said, <HI>They must never come forth of that Room while they lived:</HI> And pretending to be kind to them, he farther said, <HI>You may thank God and me, that it is no worse; for it was like to be worse.</HI> Thereupon they said, That <HI>if they had died, they had di∣ed as innocent as ever any Servants of the Lord.</HI> He then said, <HI>It was well they were innocent;</HI> and turning to <HI>Sarah,</HI> he bid her, <HI>Take Notice what Tor∣ment</HI> Katharine <HI>should be in at the Hour of Death;</HI> saying, <HI>Thousands of De∣vils would fetch her Soul to Hell.</HI> But <HI>Sarah</HI> told him, <HI>She did not fear any such Thing.</HI> He then asked <HI>Katharine, if she did not think it expedient for the Elders of the Church to pray over the Sick.</HI> And she said, <HI>Yea, such as are moved of the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> He then fell down on his Knees, and did howl, and wish bitter Wishes upon himself, if he had not the true Faith. The Physician in the mean while was enraged, because she did not bow to him.</P>
<P>Now whilst <HI>Katharine</HI> was sick, <HI>Sarah</HI> was not without great Afflic∣tion; for it grieved her to see her dear Companion so ill; and she easily foresaw, that if <HI>Katharine</HI> died, her own Sufferings would be heavier. But yet she was given up to the Will of the Lord, and would not in the least grudge at <HI>Katharine</HI>'s eternal Rest. But in Time, <HI>Katharine</HI> be∣gan to mend, and grow hungry; and eating, she was refreshed. But the Room wherein they were locked was so excessively hot, that they were often fain to rise out of their Bed, and lie down at the Chink of the Door, for Air to fetch Breath. And this Heat was the greater, be∣cause it came not only from without, but within also; which so affec∣ted them, that their Skin was parched, and the Hair fell off their Heads, and they fainted often; and their Afflictions were so great, that when it was Day, they wished for Night; and when it was Night, they wish∣ed for Day; yea, thro' human Weakness they desired Death, eating their Bread weeping, and mingling their Drink with Tears. Once <HI>Ka∣tharine</HI> asked the Monks, who came to her with a Physician, and said it was in Charity, <HI>Whether they did not keep them in that hot Room to kill them, and bring a Physician to keep them longer alive?</HI> To this the Friar said, <HI>The Inquisitor would lose his Head, if he should take them thence; and it was better to keep them there than to kill them.</HI> Then they writ to the Inquisitor, and laid their Innocency before him; and said also, <HI>If it were their Blood they thirsted after, they might take it any other Way, as well as to smother them in that hot Room.</HI> But this so incensed him, that he sent the Friar to them, who took away their Ink-horns, their Bibles being taken from them be∣fore
<PB N="291" REF="003104_0302_0FEFF6255ED5FB60"/>
They asked then, <HI>Why their Goods were taken away?</HI> To which it was answered, <HI>All is ours; and your Lives too if we will.</HI> Then they ask∣ed, <HI>How they had forfeited their Lives?</HI> To which it was told them, <HI>For bringing Books and Papers.</HI> They reply'd, <HI>If there were any Thing in them that was not true, they might write against it.</HI> To this the Monk said, <HI>They scorned to write to Fools and Asses, that did not know true Latin.</HI> And it was farther told them, <HI>The Inquisitor would have them separated, because</HI> Katha∣rine <HI>was weak, and she should go into a cooller Room; but</HI> Sarah <HI>should a∣bide there.</HI> Then <HI>Katharine</HI> took <HI>Sarah</HI> by the Arm, and said, <HI>The Lord hath joined us together, and Woe be to them that part us. I had rather die here with my Friend, than part from her.</HI> This so struck the Friar, that he went away, and came no more in five Weeks, and the Door of their Room was not opened in all that Time.</P>
<P>Then the Monks came again to part them, but <HI>Katharine</HI> was sick, and broken out from Head to Foot. They thereupon sent for a Doctor, and he said, <HI>They must have Air, or else they must die.</HI> This was told the Inquisitor, and he ordered the Door to be set open six Hours in a Day. But ten Weeks after, they were parted; which was such a grievous Af∣fliction, that they declared, Death it self would not have been so hard to them. But the Monks said, <HI>They corrupted each other, and that being parted, they would bow and submit.</HI> But they saw themselves disappointed; for the Women were stronger afterwards than before, the Lord fitting them for every Condition. Before they were parted, the Friars brought them a Scourge of small Hempen Cords, asking them, <HI>If they would have it?</HI> and saying, <HI>they were used to whip themselves till the Blood came.</HI> But the Women said, <HI>that could not reach the Devil, he sat upon the Heart.</HI> Then the Monks said, <HI>All the People of</HI> Malta <HI>are for you; if ye will be Catholicks, none but will like you.</HI> To which they returned, <HI>The Lord hath changed us into that which changeth not.</HI> The Monks then said, <HI>All our holy Women do pray for you; and ye shall be honoured of all the World, if ye will turn.</HI> They replied, <HI>The World lies in Wickedness, and the Honour and Glory of the World we have denied.</HI> To this the Monks said, <HI>Ye shall be honoured of God too; but now ye are hated of all. This,</HI> said one of the Women, <HI>is an evident To∣ken whose Servants we are. The Servant is not greater than his Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Once on a first Day of the Week the Friars came, and commanded them <HI>to kneel down with them to Prayer.</HI> They signified they could not pray, but as they were moved by the Lord. Then the Friars comman∣ded them the second Time, and kneeled down by their Bedside, and pray∣ed after this Manner; which being done, they said to the Women, <HI>We have tried your Spirits, now we know what Spirit ye are of.</HI> But they told them, <HI>They could not know that, unless their Minds were turned to the Light of Christ in their Consciences.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Friar then growing angry, shew∣ed them his Crucifix, and bid them look on it. But they told him, the Lord saith, <HI>Thou shalt not make to thy self the Likeness of any Thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Water under the Earth; thou shalt not bow to them, nor worship them, but I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</HI> The Friar seeing <HI>Sarah</HI> speak so boldly to him, called for the Irons to chain her. She then bowed her Head, and said to him, <HI>Not only my Hands and Feet, but my Neck also for the Testimony of Jesus.</HI> The Friar seeming appeased, said, <HI>He would do them any Good he could; far he saw what they did was not in Malice.</HI> And the Friars came often and said to them, <HI>If ye would but do a little, ye should be set at Liberty; but you will do nothing at all, but are against every Thing.</HI> To which they returned, <HI>that thy would do any Thing that might tend to God's Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst they were imprisoned here, it happened that the Inquisition-House was new built, or repaired, which took up about the Space of a Year and a Half; and during this Time some of the great Ones
<PB N="292" REF="003104_0303_0FEFF5E6D4BAB3A0"/>
came often to see the Building, which gave Opportunity to these Wo∣men to speak to them, and to declare the Truth in the Name ot the Lord.</P>
<P>Now tho' they were threatned by the Monks for preaching the Light of Christ so boldly, yet not only the Magistrates, but the Lord Inqui∣sitor grew moderate towards them, and gave Order they should have Pens, Ink and Paper to write to <HI>England.</HI> And they seemed inclined to have set them at Liberty; but the Friars workt mightily against it; and had laboured about three Quarters or a Year to part them, before they could bring it to pass. And when at length they had effected it, they told <HI>Katharine, That they should never see one another's Faces again.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>Katharine</HI> being sickly, had little Stomach to eat, and had no Mind to eat any Thing but what came from <HI>Sarah</HI> to her. And having told one of the Friars, that she wanted some body to wash her Linnen, and to prepare some warm Victuals for her, he sent to <HI>Sa∣rah,</HI> to know if she would do it for her; and she said she would. And by that Means they for some Weeks heard of one another every Day; and the Friar said once to <HI>Katharine, You may free your self of Misery when you will; you may make your self a Catholick, and have your Freedom to go where you will:</HI> To which she told him, <HI>Thus I might have a Name that I did live, when I was dead. Thou hast Catholicks enough already. Endeavour to bring some of them to the Light in their Consciences, that they may stand in awe, and sin not.</HI> But he was so eager, that he said, <HI>He would lose one of his Fingers, if she and</HI> Sarah <HI>would be Catholicks.</HI> Then she told him, <HI>It was</HI> Babylon <HI>that was built with Blood, but</HI> Sion <HI>was redeemed thro' Judgment.</HI> Many Ways were used to draw them off; and once they would have perswaded her to set a Picture at her Bed's Head, for a Representation: But she said as with Abhorrence, <HI>What, do ye think I want a Calf to wor∣ship? Do ye walk by the Rule of Scripture?</HI> To which the Friar said, <HI>We do, but we have Traditions too.</HI> She replied, <HI>If your Traditions derogate or dissent from the Fundamentals of Christ's Doctrine, the Prophets and Apostles, I deny them in the Name of the Lord.</HI> But he asserted <HI>that they did not.</HI> Then she asked, <HI>What Rule they had to burn those that could not joyn with them for Conscience Sake?</HI> And he returned, <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>did worse, for he gave them to the Devil;</HI> and farther said, <HI>that they did judge all damned that were not of their Faith.</HI> Then she objected to him several of the superstitious Rites of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and mentioned also the <HI>forbidding of Mar∣riage, which,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1. 3.</NOTE> said she, <HI>is a Doctrine of Devils,</HI> according to the Saying of the Apostle. The Friar being put to a Nonplus, told her, <HI>That St.</HI> Peter <HI>was the Pope of</HI> Rome, <HI>and did build an Altar there, and the Pope was his Suc∣cessor, and he could do what he would.</HI> But she refuted this with sound Reason. He then boasting of the Antiquity of their Church, she sig∣nified that the Church she was of was yet older; for, said she, <HI>Our Faith was from the Beginning; and</HI> Abel <HI>was of our Church.</HI> The Friar be∣ing at a Loss, and not longer able to hold out against <HI>Katharine,</HI> went to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and talked with her at the same Rate; and she also told him, <HI>Abel was of our Church:</HI> To which he said, <HI>Abel was a Catholick;</HI> and quite over-shooting himself, he said likewise, <HI>and</HI> Cain <HI>and</HI> Judas <HI>were so.</HI> To which <HI>Sarah</HI> returned, <HI>Then the Devil was a Catholick; and I won't be one; I will not turn; tho' ye would tear me to Pieces, I believe the Lord would enable me to endure it.</HI></P>
<P>At another Time the said Friar, whose Name was <HI>Malachy,</HI> came a∣gain to <HI>Katharine,</HI> and told her, <HI>If she would be a Catholick, she should say so; otherwise they would use her badly, and she should never see the Face of</HI> Sarah <HI>again, but should die by her self, and a thousand Devils should carry her Soul to H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l.</HI> She then asked him, <HI>If he were the Messenger of God to her?</HI> And he said, <HI>Yes. Why, what is my Sin,</HI> said she; <HI>or wherein have I pro∣voked the Lord, that he doth send me such a Message? It is,</HI> returned the
<PB N="293" REF="003104_0304_0FEFF6274FFE3D00"/>
Monk, <HI>because you will not be a Catholick.</HI> Whereupon she said, <HI>I deny thee and thy Message too, and the Spirit which speaks in thee; for the Lord ne∣ver spoke so.</HI> He growing angry, said, that <HI>he would lay her in a whole Pile of Chains, where she should see neither Sun nor Moon.</HI> And she intimating how resigned she was, said, <HI>He could not separate her from the Love of God in Crist Jesus, lay her were-ever he would.</HI> And he farther saying, <HI>he would give her to the Devil,</HI> she resumed, <HI>I don't fear all the Devils in Hell; the Lord is my Keeper. Tho' thou hadst the Inquisition, with all the Countries round about it on thy Side, and I was alone by my self, I do not fear them; if there were Thousands more, the Lord is on my Right Hand; and the worst they can do, is but to kill the Body, they can touch my Life no more than the Devil could</HI> Job's. Then the Monk said, <HI>she should never go out of that Room alive.</HI> To which she couragiously said, <HI>The Lord is sufficient to deliver me; but whether he will or no, I will not forsake the living Fountain, to drink at a broken Cistern. And ye have no Law to keep us here, but such a Law as</HI> Ahab <HI>had for</HI> Naboth's <HI>Vineyard.</HI> The Monk then cursing himself, and calling up∣on his Gods, ran away, and as he was pulling the Door, he said, <HI>A∣bide there, Member of the Devil.</HI> To which she said, <HI>The Devil's Members do the Devil's Works; and the Woes and Plagues of the Lord will be upon them for it.</HI></P>
<P>He then went and told the Inquisitor of it, who laugh'd at him; and before he came again, <HI>Katharine</HI> was moved out of that Room; when he came, he brought one of the Inquisitor's Men with him, and two very good Hens, and said, <HI>The Lord Inquisitor had sent them in Love to her.</HI> To which she said, <HI>She received his Love,</HI> but yet she shewed herself not very ready to accept them; and signified, <Q>That she was willing to pay for them, being loth to be chargeable to any, whilst she had of her own.</Q> The Friar, who it seems would have had them lay down their Money, at his Feet, said, <HI>They must not count any Thing their own; for in the primitive Times, they sold their Possessions, and laid them down at the Apo∣stles Feet.</HI> He further said, <HI>You shall not want any Thing, tho' we should spend a thousand Crowns. But you are proud, because you will not take the Inquisitor's Hens, which he sent you in Charity.</HI> She then asking, <HI>What Kind of Charity this was, since he kept her in Prison?</HI> The Friar said, <HI>It was for the Good of their Souls he kept them in Prison,</HI> farther adding, <HI>If you had not been going to preach, ye might have gone where ye would.</HI> She returned, <HI>Our Souls are out of the Inquisitor's Reach. Why should your Love extend more to us than to your own Family? For they commit all Manner of Sin, which you cannot charge us with. Why don't ye put them into the Inquisition, and bid them turn?</HI> He then said, <HI>You have not the true Faith;</HI> and shewing her his Crucifix, ask∣ed her, <HI>If she thought he did worship that?</HI> And she asked him, <HI>What then did he with it?</HI> To which he answered, <HI>It was a Representation.</HI> And she replied, <HI>It did not represent Christ, for he was the express Image of his Father's Glory, which is Light and Life. But,</HI> continued she, <HI>If thou canst put any Life in any of thy Images, then bring them to me. What Representation had</HI> Daniel <HI>in the Lion's Den, or</HI> Jonas <HI>in the Whale's Belly? They cried unto the Lord, and he delivered them.</HI> The Friar, who could not abide to hear her speak so much against Idols, said, <HI>She talked like a mad Woman,</HI> ad∣ding, <HI>I'll give you to the Devil.</HI> She not fearing this, said, <HI>Give thy own, I am the Lord's.</HI> He then stood up, and said, <HI>I will do to you, as the A∣postles did to</HI> Ananias <HI>and</HI> Sapphira. She then standing up also, said, <HI>I deny thee in the Name of the Lord, the living God, thou hast no Power over me.</HI> Then away he went with the Hens to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and told her, <HI>that</HI> Katha∣rine <HI>was sick, and the Lord Inquisitor had sent two Hens, and she would be glad to eat a Piece of one, if she would dress one of them presently, and the other To∣morrow. Sarah</HI> no less circumspect, and cautious than <HI>Katharine,</HI> and unwilling to receive this Gift, before she knew what might be expedi∣ent,
<PB N="294" REF="003104_0305_0FEFF5E906CE66B0"/>answered him accordingly as <HI>Katharine</HI> did. Then he carryed the Hens away again, saying, <HI>You would fain be burnt, because you would make the World believe you did love God so well as to suffer in that Kind. Katharine</HI> hearing this, said, <HI>I do not desire to be burnt; but if the Lord should call me to it, I believe he will give me Power to undergo it for his Truth: And if every Hair of my Head was a Body, I could offer them up all for the Testimony of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>The Friar coming afterwards again, ask'd <HI>Katharine, Whether she had not been inspired of the Holy Ghost to be a</HI> Catholick, <HI>since she came into the Inquisition.</HI> She said, <HI>No.</HI> But he maintaining the contrary, said, <HI>You are those who call the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of the Devil. No,</HI> re∣plied they, (who tho' they were parted, yet could hear one another) <HI>The Spirit of the Holy Ghost in us will resist the Devil. And the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost is not wrought in the Will of Man, nor in Man's Time; but in God's Will and Time.</HI> More Discourse they had about this Matter, and then asking for their Bibles, which had been taken from them, he said, <HI>They should never see them again, for they were false.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they were often troubled and importuned by the Friars, who generally came two at a Time, tho' sometimes but one. One of these often lifted up his Hand to strike them, but did not: For they not be∣ing moved by Fear, he was put out of Countenance, and would say, <HI>They were good Women, and he would do them any Good.</HI> As indeed some∣times he did work for them, and would say, <HI>It was for God's Sake, and that they ought to thank him for it.</HI> To which they replied, <HI>Those that did any Thing for God, did not look for a Reward from Man;</HI> which once made him so angry, that he said, <HI>They were the worst of all Creatures, and they should be used worse than the</HI> Turks, Armenians, <HI>and</HI> Lutherans. Where∣upon one of them said, <HI>The pure Life was ever counted the worst, and if we must suffer, we are the Lord's, and can trust him. Do what ye will with us, we do not fear any evil Tidings; we are settled and grounded in Truth; and the more ye persecute us, the stronger we grow.</HI> For this they experienced, in∣deed, according to what they signified in their Letters, tho' they were separated a Year from each other. The Friars coming once to <HI>Sarah,</HI> told her, <HI>If she would, she might go out of the Prison, and say and do nothing.</HI> And she saying, <HI>She would on that Account,</HI> They said, they would come next Morning. But <HI>Sarah</HI> perceived their Deceit, and therefore when they came, she, to avoid the Snare, could not resolve to go forth, tho' the Friars behaved themselves friendly, and told her that the Inquisi∣tion had said, <HI>If they wanted Linnen, Woollen, Stockings, Shoes, or Money, they should have it.</HI></P>
<P>Once it happened that an <HI>English</HI> Man who lived there, having heard that <HI>Sarah</HI> was in a Room with a Window next the Street, got up by the Wall, and spoke a few Words to her; but he was violently haled down, and cast into Prison upon Life and Death; for he was one they had taken from the Turks, and made a <HI>Papist</HI> of him. The Friars com∣ing to them to know whether he had brought them any Letters, they said <HI>No.</HI> Neither had <HI>Katharine</HI> seen him; yet it was told them, he was like to be hang'd. Of this <HI>Sarah</HI> gave Information to <HI>Katharine,</HI> by writ∣ing a few Lines to her, (for it seems they then could not hear one ano∣ther) and she told her, she thought the <HI>English</HI> Friars were the chief Ac∣tors of this Business. This grieved <HI>Katharine,</HI> and she wrote to <HI>Sarah</HI> a∣gain, (for they had a private Way to send to each other.) In this Let∣ter, after her Salutation, she said to <HI>Sarah,</HI> <Q>That she might be sure, the Friars were the chief Actors; but that she believed the Lord would preserve that poor <HI>English</HI> Man for his Love, and that she was made to seek the Lord for him with Tears: And that she desired her to send him something once a Day, if the Keeper would carry it. That she her self was ravished with the Love of God to her Soul, and her
<PB N="295" REF="003104_0306_0FEFF62ACD97F330"/>
Beloved was the chiefest of ten Thousands; and that she did not fear the Face of any Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' she felt their Arrows. Moreover that she had a Prospect of their safe Return into <HI>England:</HI> And in the Conclusion, she bid <HI>Sarah</HI> take Heed, if she was tempted with Money.</Q> But this Letter, (by what Means they never knew) came to the <HI>English</HI> Friar's Hands, who translating it into <HI>Italian,</HI> delivered it to the Lord Inquisi∣tor; and afterwards came with Inquisitor's Deputy to <HI>Katharine,</HI> and shewed her both the Papers, and asked her, <HI>If she could read it? viz</HI> the <HI>English</HI> one. <HI>Yea,</HI> said she, <HI>I writ it, O, did you indeed?</HI> said he. <HI>And what is it you say of me here? Nothing but what is true,</HI> replied she. Then he said, <HI>Where is the Paper</HI> Sarah <HI>sent? Give it, or else I will search your Trunk, and every where else.</HI> She then bidding him <HI>search where he would,</HI> he said, <HI>She must tell him who it was that brought her Ink, or else she should be tyed with Chains presently.</HI> And she returned, <HI>She had done nothing but what was just and right in the Sight of God; and what she did suffer on that Account would be for Truth's-sake. And she would not meddle with the poor Workmen.</HI> Then he said, <HI>For Gods-sake tell me what</HI> Sarah <HI>did write.</HI> And she told him something, and said, what she spoke was Truth. <HI>But</HI> re∣turned he, <HI>You say it is much we do not tempt you with Money.</HI> And this indeed happened afterwards. The Deputy then took <HI>Katharine</HI>'s Ink, and threw it away; and so they went also; and the poor <HI>Englishman</HI> was released next Morning. They now coming to <HI>Sarah,</HI> told her, <HI>That</HI> Katharine <HI>honestly had confess'd all, and that she had best to confess too:</HI> And they threatned her with a Halter, and that they would take away her Bed and Trunk, and her Money too. To which <HI>Sarah</HI> said, <HI>It may be she might not send to</HI> Katherine <HI>any more:</HI> And she ask'd the Deputy, <HI>Whe∣ther he was a Minister of Christ, or a Magistrate? If he were a Magistrate,</HI> said she, <HI>he might take her Money, but she would not give it him.</HI> He then grow∣ing angry, said, <HI>She was possess'd.</HI> To which she reply'd, <HI>If so, then it was with the Power of an endless Life.</HI></P>
<P>Thus from Time to Time they suffered many Assaults; and sometimes it so happened, that those who came to see them, were struck to the Heart, which offended the Friars. Now at length their Money was al∣most gone, they having sometimes employ'd it for Victuals. But the Friars told them, <HI>They might have kept their Money for other Services; for they should have maintain'd them whilst they kept them Prisoners.</HI> To this they said, <HI>They could not keep their Money, and be chargeable to others.</HI> Then it so fell out, that their Stomachs were taken away, and they did eat but little for three or four Weeks, till at length they found themselves obliged to Fasting for several Days together; which made the Friars say, <HI>That it was impossible that People could live with so little Meat, as they did.</HI> And it was told them, <HI>The Lord Inquisitor had said, they might have any Thing they would.</HI> To which they signifying that it was not in their own Will they fasted, said, <HI>They must wait to know the Mind of the Lord, what he would have them to do.</HI> They continued weak, especially <HI>Sarah,</HI> who apprehending her Death near, did therefore dress her Head as she would lie in the Grave. They both were so feeble that they could not put on their Cloaths, neither put them off, being also unable to make their Beds. And tho' they desired to be together in one Room, yet the Friars would not permit it: In this Condition they concluded they were like to die: But Heaven had provided otherwise. <HI>Katharine</HI> about that Time being exercised in Supplication to the Lord, that it might please him to put an End to their Trial, which Way it seemed good in his Sight, thought she heard a Voice, saying, <HI>Ye shall not die,</HI> and she took this to be a Heavenly Voice: And from that Time they felt themselves refreshed with the living Presence of the Lord, to their great Joy and Comfort, so that they felt Freedom to eat again; and
<PB N="296" REF="003104_0307_0FEFF5EAC021A160"/>
then they were provided with good Victuals, but yet they were under a Fear of Eating any Thing which in some Respect might be counted unclean; and therefore they cried unto the Lord, and said, <HI>We had ra∣ther die, than eat any Thing that is polluted and unclean.</HI> And <HI>Katharine</HI> be∣lieved it was said to her from the Lord, <HI>Thou may'st as freely eat, as if thou hadst wrought for it with thy Hands.</HI> And <HI>Sarah,</HI> who sometimes had wrought for others in the Inquisition-House, was persuaded that it was told her by Inspiration, <HI>Thou shalt eat the Fruit of thy Hands and be blessed.</HI> And so they did eat, and for eight or ten Days they got what∣ever they did call for. But afterwards they were so straitned for want of Food, that it did them more Hurt than their Fast. Yet they being preserved alive, the Friars said, <HI>The Lord keeps them alive by his mighty Power, because they should be Catholicks.</HI> To which they returned, <HI>It should be known one day, the Lord had another End in it.</HI> But the Friars told them plainly, <HI>There was no Redemption from them.</HI> Whereupon they said, <HI>With the Lord there was Mercy and plenteous Redemption:</HI> And they bid them, <HI>Take heed ye be not found Fighters against God.</HI> To which the Friars return∣ed, <HI>Ye are foolish Women. Then we are,</HI> replied they, <HI>the Lord's Fools; and they are dear and precious in his Sight.</HI> The Friars then shewing their sha∣ven Crowns, said, that <HI>They were the Lord's Fools;</HI> And pointing at their Gowns, said, <HI>They did wear them for God's-sake, to be laught at by the World.</HI> One of the Friars about this Time did what he could to send <HI>Katharine</HI> to <HI>Rome:</HI> And not succeeding, he said they should go both. But this not taking Effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Friar sent to the Pope with a Charge against <HI>Kat. Evans.</HI></NOTE> the Friar was sent thither, with a Paper to the Pope, containing Matter of Charge against <HI>Katharine;</HI> but she speaking zea∣lously to the Scribe, pronounced Woe against it, and defied it in the Name of the Lord. Before the Friar departed, he told <HI>Sarah,</HI> Katha∣rine <HI>was a Witch, and that she knew what was done elsewhere.</HI> Thus he said, because once telling <HI>Katharine</HI> abundance of Lyes, she told him, <HI>She had a Witness for God in her, which was faithful and true; and she believed this Witness.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Consul dis∣courses with them</NOTE> After he was gone, the <HI>English</HI> Consul came to her with a Dollar from a Master of a Ship who came from <HI>Plymouth:</HI> She told him, <HI>She did receive her Countryman's Love, but could not receive his Money.</HI> He then ask'd her, <HI>What she would do if she would take no Money?</HI> To which she answered, <HI>The Lord is my Portion, and thus I can't want any good Thing.

<P>Whilst the Friar was gone to <HI>Rome,</HI> it was told them, they were also to be sent thither; and there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed great Working about it; but it seems they could not agree in the Matter. In the mean while, <HI>Katha∣rine</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> remained separated, and there were five Doors between them with Locks and Bolts; and yet <HI>Sarah</HI> sometimes found an Oppor∣tunity, either by the Carelesness of the Keeper, or that it was done on Purpose, to come where she could see <HI>Katharine;</HI> and how much soever the Friars did watch them, yet she came to <HI>Katharine</HI>'s Door by Night. But being once discover'd, she was lock'd up again; yet not long after the Doors were again open, so that they sat in sight of each other.</P>
<P>Sometimes there were of divers Nations brought Prisoners into the the Inquisition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They shew the Errors of Po∣pery to Priso∣ners brought to the Inquisi∣tion.</NOTE> and the Friars and other great Men endeavour'd in their Way to make Christians of them.

At length it happened that two <HI>Englishmen</HI> came into the City, and try'd to obtain their Liberty, but in vain. Yet a little while after, the Magistrates sent for and ask'd them whether they were sick, or whether they did want any Thing; saying, <HI>They might write to</HI> England, ordering the Scribe to give them Ink and Paper.</P>
<P>Not long after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> used to pro∣cure their Li∣berty.</NOTE> came one <HI>Francis Steward,</HI> a Captain of a Ship, and a Friar of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who both took great Pains to get them released; for their Friends in <HI>England</HI> had not been wanting in any Thing that might procure their Liberty.

After some Time, the Inquisitor came again into the Tower where they sat; and <HI>Sarah</HI> called to him, and desired the Door might be opened for them to go down into the Court to wash their Clothes. He then ordared the Door to be opened once a Week; and not long af∣ter it was open every Day. And since it had been said that they could not be released without the Pope's Leave, <HI>Sarah</HI> said to him, <HI>If we are the Pope's Prisoners, we appeal to the Pope: Send us therefore to him.</HI> But those that had their Abode in the Inquisition, especially the Friars, were thair mortal Enemies, altho' they would sometimes have fed them with the best of their Victuals, and given them whole Bottles of Wine, if they would have received it: And it troubled them exceed∣ingly that they refused to eat and drink with them; which they did, because they look'd upon them as their fierce Persecutors,</P>
<P>Once there came two or three <HI>English,</HI> Ships into the Harbour, and the <HI>English</HI> Consul telling them of it, said, <HI>That he did what he could for them, but that they would not let them go, unless they would turn</HI> Catholicks, <HI>and that therefore they must suffer more Imprisonment yet.</HI> Before <HI>Sarah</HI> knew these Ships were come thither, she saw them in the Night in a Dream, and heard a Voice saying, <HI>That they could not go yet.</HI> When the Ships were gone, they were sent for, and it was asked them, <HI>If they would be</HI> Catholicks? To which they answered, <HI>They were true Christians, and had received the Spirit of Christ.</HI> One of the Magistrates shewing them the Cross, they told him, <HI>They did take up the Cross of Christ daily, which was the Power of God to crucify Sin and Iniquity.</HI> Knowing that there was a Friar, who, as the Captain had told them, took a great Deal of Pains for them, but not seeing him there, (for he secretly favouring them, was now ab∣sent) they said to those that were present, <HI>One of your Fathers hath promi∣sed us our Liberty.</HI> But this availed nothing. Yet they acknowledged his Kindness, and told him afterwards, <HI>He would never have Cause to repent it</HI></P>

But, <HI>said he,</HI> you have not the true Faith.</HI> To which she answer'd, <HI>By Faith we stand, and by the Power of God we are upheld. Dost thou think it is by our own Power and Holiness we are kept from a vain Conversation, from Sin and Wickedness?</HI> He then saying, <HI>That was their Pride;</HI> she told him, <HI>We can glory in the Lord; we were Children of Wrath once as well as others; but the Lord hath quickned us that were dead, by the living Word of his Grace, and hath washed, cleansed, and sanctified us in Soul and Spirit, in Part, according to our Measures; and we do press for∣ward towards that which is perfect.</HI> He then said, <HI>Ye are good Women; but yet there is no Redemption for you, except ye will be</HI> Catholicks. This was the Old Lesson of the Friars, who at another Time, said, <HI>Ye may be</HI> Catholicks, <HI>and keep your own Religion too, and ye shall not he known to be</HI> Catholicks, <HI>except ye were brought before a Justice.</HI> To which thay re∣turned, <HI>What, should we profess a Christ we should be asham'd of?</HI></P>
<P>Some of those that came to see them, would pity them, for not turn∣ing <HI>Catholicks;</HI> but others shewed their Hatred, by crying, that they must be burnt, and by bawling, <HI>Fuoco, Fuoco,</HI> [Fire, Fire,] Whilst they were separated from each other, <HI>Katharine</HI> was often much concerned for <HI>Sa∣rah,</HI>

and afraid that she should be ensnared; for one of the Friars ma∣ny Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> accost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her with fawning Words;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Katharine</HI> it sollicitous for <HI>Sarah.</HI> Yet both re∣avain firm, &amp; often full of Comfort.</NOTE> But they both continu'd stedfast, and were often ravished by the inward Joy and Consolation they felt. <HI>Katharine</HI> in one of her Letters, said, <Q>That the Spirit of Prayer was once upon her, but that she was afraid to speak to the Lord, for Fear she should speak one Word that would not please him.</Q> And then it was returned her from the Lord, <HI>Fear not, Daughter</HI> of Sion; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what thou wilt, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will grant it thee, whatsoever thy Heart can wish.</HI> But she desired nothing of the Lord, but what would make for his Glory, whether it were her Liberty, or Bondage, Life, or Death, And in this Resignedness she found her self accepted of the Lord.</P>
<P>Sometimes they spoke so effectually to those that came to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The different Effects of their Discourse on different Per∣sons.</NOTE> that they could not gainsay them, but were made to confess that God was with them; tho' others would make a hideous Noiss, and cry <HI>Jesu Maria,</HI> and run away as People that were struck with Fear. <HI>Katharine</HI>'s Prison being so near the Street, that she could be heard of those that wen by, she was moved sometimes to call them to <HI>Repentance, and to turn to the Light wherewith they were enlighten'd, which would lead them out of all their wicked Ways and Works, to serve the true and living God in Spirit and in Truth.</HI> This so reached some, that they did sigh and groan, and stay to hear her; but not long, it being forbidden upon great Pain. Yet some that passed by to their Worship-houses, were so wicked, that they threw Stones at her Window, and often made a sad Noise, and howled like Dogs.</P>
<P>Thus they were assaulted both from abroad, and within Doors, from the Friars, who fiercely threatned them for their bold Testimony against Idolatry. Once when they shewed <HI>Sarah, Mary</HI> and her Babe pictured against a Wall, and would have her look upon it; she, to shew her Zeal against Idol-worship, stampt with her Foot, and said, <HI>Cursed are all Images, and Image-Makers, and those that fall down to worship them.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sarah</HI>'s Zeal against Idolatry.</NOTE></P>
<P>Once it happened, that some <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships came to join with the Cavaliers of <HI>Malta,</HI> to fight against the <HI>Turks. Sarah</HI> hearing this, said <HI>God is angry, God is angry; go not forth to kill one another; Christ came not to destroy Life, but to save it.</HI> This she told many, who were persuaded of obtaining a Victory: But it fell out otherwise, for their Fleet was beaten by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and they returned with great Damage.</P>
<P>A Friar coming once to <HI>Katharine,</HI> ask'd her, <HI>Why she did not work?</HI> Which made her say to him, <HI>What Work dost thou do?</HI> He answered, <HI>I write.</HI> To which she return'd, I <HI>ll write too if thou wilt bring me Pen, Ink, and Paper.</HI> But he not willing she should write, said, St. Paul <HI>did work at</HI> Rome; <HI>and by knitting she might get about three Halfpence a Day.</HI> She told him, <HI>If we could have had that Privilege among you, which</HI> Paul <HI>had at</HI> Rome <HI>under</HI> Caesar, <HI>who was a Heathen Prince, we would have wrought, and not have been chargeable to any; for he lived in his own hired House two Years preaching the Gospel and Doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> She ask'd him also, <HI>Whether he knew the holy War of God? And if thou knowest at,</HI> said she, <HI>then thou canst but know, that we can't be without Exercise Day nor Night.</HI> This stopt his Mouth; Besides, it was well known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are not idle in Prison.</NOTE> that they spent not their Time idly; for they knit Stockings for those that were services able to them; they made Garments for the poor Prisoners, and mend∣ded their Clothes; tho' they were not willing to work for the Friars, who sometimes coming to her, kneeled down, and would have <HI>Katha∣rine</HI> to say after them the Words they spoke. But this she refused to do, tho' it made these Men grow more angry. Such and the like Occurrences so grieved her, that once in Anguish of Spirit she cried out to God, <HI>It were better for me to die than to live thus:</HI> For being almost continually constrained to testify against Idolatry and Superstition, she wou'd have been willing to have laid down her Life for a Testimony

against it, if it had been required of her. And when once the Friars told her, that <HI>Sarah</HI> was to be carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> whilst she should stay at <HI>Malta,</HI> it so grieved her, that with Supplication she ask'd the Lord, <HI>If he did not count her worthy to go to</HI> Rome also, and to offer up her Life there for the Testimony of Jesus; because, if she was at Liberty to chuse, she would rather do so, than return without her to England.</P>
<P>At another Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More Dis∣course with a Friar.</NOTE> when it was told them, That their Bibles were false, <HI>Katharine</HI> ask'd the Friar that said so, <HI>Wherein are they false?</HI> He replied, <HI>Because the Books of the</HI> Maechabees <HI>were not in them.</HI> To which she an∣swered, That <HI>tho' something might be wanting, yet the rest might be good for all that: But if something were added, then the Bible was corrupted.</HI> This struck at some Additions she had seen in the Bibles there. Then he ask'd her whether she did not think that every one must bow at the Name of <HI>Jesus:</HI> And she answering, <HI>Yea,</HI> he said, <HI>Jesus,</HI> and bid her to kneel down, or to bow her self. To which she said, <HI>That her Heart and whole Body was bowed down under the Name of Jesus; but that she would not bow at the Will of him or any Body else. He that departs from Iniquity</HI> (thus she continued) <HI>bows before the Name Jesus; but they that live in Sin and Wickedness do not bow before the Son of God.</HI> Then he said, <HI>That he and his Com∣panions stood in the same Power, and were led by the same Spirit as the Apostles;</HI> which made her ask, <HI>Why then they abused that Power, and used carnal Weapons?</HI> He answer'd, <HI>They did not do so; for their Inquisition, nay, even their Chains and Fetters were Spiritual.</HI> Then he ask'd her whether she did not think all those damned that were not of her Persuasion: She said, <HI>No; Christ hath not taught us so; for those that are to Day in a State of Reprobation, the Lord, if it please him, can call to Morrow out of it.</HI> He then said, <HI>We think you damned, and all those that are not of our Belief.</HI> To which she return∣ed, <HI>The Judgment of Man doth not hurt us.</HI> Sometimes some came to the Prison upon their Saints-days, and ask'd them, <HI>What Day it was?</HI> And they not being acquainted with those Saints, would answer, <HI>We don't know it.</HI> When the others told them that it was such or such a Saint Day, and that this Saint would punish them that Night, because they did not observe his Day; They answered, <HI>That they knew the Saints to be at Peace with them, and that therefore they did not fear them.</HI> Another Time a Friar came and told them, <HI>It was seventeen Days to</HI> Christmas, <HI>and that the Virgin</HI> Mary <HI>conceived that present Day.</HI> On which <HI>Katharine</HI> made this pretty Remark, that indeed this was very singular, <HI>That she did go with Child but seventeen Days.</HI> Such like Occurrences grieved her exceed∣ingly, when she considered the gross Darkness these People were in: And as she was crying to the Lord in Prayer, that it seemed that all their Travel and Labour was fruitless, she felt this Answer: <HI>Be not grieved tho'</HI> Israel <HI>be not gathered; the Seed of</HI> Malta <HI>is to increase into Mul∣titude; that which ye have sown shall not die, but live.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Katharine</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> had been imprison'd at <HI>Malta</HI> about three Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.

But they were unwilling to enter into those Terms, as not knowing what the Lord one Time or other might re∣quire of them. <HI>Daniel</HI> seeing he could not obtain their Deliverance this Way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He offers to be imprisoned for them, yea to lay down his Life for their Liberty.</NOTE> offered himself to be imprisoned instead of them; and this not being accepted, he went yet farther, and signified, <HI>That he was wil∣ling to lay down his Life for their Liberty, if it was not to be purchased other∣wise.</HI> Great Love indeed! of which but few Instances are to be found. And they hearing of this, were touched with exceeding great Admi∣ration. In the mean while he found a Way to get some Letters deli∣vered<PB N="301" REF="003104_0312_0FEFF63161375390"/>
to them, and wrote also himself both to comfort and exhort them to Stedfastness. At length he found Means also to speak to them; for on a Time as they stood at the Prison-Grates, he being come in their Sight, saluted them in these Words; <HI>The whole Body of God's Elect, right dearly Beloved, own your Testimony, and ye are a sweet Savour unto the Lord and his People.</HI> To which one of them answered, <HI>That it was a Trouble to them that they could not be more serviceable.</HI> This made his Heart melt with Pity and Compassion, considering the wonderful Mercy of the Lord in preserving them, without fainting in that sharp Trial. And they beholding one another at a Distance thro' the Iron Grates, were mutually refreshed at that Season. They afterwards wrote to him, and signified with the most tender Expressions, how highly they valued his great Love; and also sent him Letters for their Friends and Relations in <HI>England;</HI> and he neglected, not to write back again to them during his Stay, which was in the Fore-part of the Year 1662.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1662</NOTE> But he was forced to leave them Prisoners there: Yet the Time of their Re∣demption drew nigh, which was brought about at the Instance of <HI>G.

<P>Some Time before <HI>Daniel Baker</HI> came to <HI>Malta,</HI> it had been told them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Sorts of Means used to pervert them.</NOTE> that if they would turn Catholicks, they might dwell at <HI>Malta.</HI> To which their Answer was, That <HI>that they were true</HI> Catholiks. One of the Magistrates said that if they would not turn Catholicks, they must yet suffer long Imprisonment by the Pope's Order. And yet it was not true that there was such an Order. It was also told them, if they would kiss the Cross, they should be released; and they might stay at the House of the <HI>English</HI> Consul until an Opportunity offered to carry them to <HI>England.</HI> In the mean while they heard that the Pope had given Order to let them pass to <HI>England</HI> without doing them any Hurt. But however it was, they were preserved well contented, and they said resolutely, that they would not kiss the Cross, nor purchase their Li∣berty at that Rate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But they con∣tinue stedfast and inflexi∣ble.</NOTE> It seems the Consul aim'd at some Advantage by their Releasment, for he told them that the Inquisitor had said, <HI>If any one would engage for three or four thousand Dollars to be paid if ever they came thither again, they should be set at Liberty.</HI> This he said also to <HI>D. Baker,</HI> and added, that <HI>if none would engage, they must die in Prison; and that this was the Pope's Order.</HI> After <HI>Baker</HI>'s Departure, Word was sent to some <HI>English</HI> Merchants, concerning such an Engagement; but none appear∣ed willing to enter into it; and the Prisoners were so far from desiring, that they spoke against it. Yet there were many that sought to obtain their Liberty, shewing themselves willing to engage for what was rea∣sonable, but all their Endeavours were in vain.</P>
<P>Once they fasted three Days, and tho' it was a cold Season, they sat upon the Ground, with very little Clothes on, without Stockings or Shoes, having nothing upon their Heads but Ashes. The Inquisitors seeing it, wondered exceedingly; and <HI>Sarah</HI> began to speak zealously against Superstition and Idolatry. And when the Time of their Fast was expired, <HI>Katharine</HI> composed the following Hymn to God.</P>

<L>Nor yet his Mercy from me shut,</L>

After <HI>Katharine</HI> had joyfully sung thus, she went to the Well in the Court, and drank much Water in the Sight of the Prisoners, as did <HI>Sarah</HI> also: For they were dry, and <HI>Sarah</HI> washing her Head also in cold Water, they cry'd out in their Language, <HI>Ye will kill your selves, and go to the Devil.</HI> But this they did not fear, neither caught they any Cold, and so became a Wonder to others.</P>
<P>About half a Year after <HI>Daniel Baker</HI> was gone, it came into <HI>Katha∣rine</HI>'s Heart, that if she could speak with the Inquisitor, he would grant them their Liberty. And it was not long after that he came to the Inquisition-Court Chamber, which they hearing, desired to speak with him, which was granted, and being admitted into his Presence, they told him, <HI>They had not wronged or defrauded any, but had suffered inno∣cently almost four Years for Conscience-sake,</HI> &amp;c. After this, the Inquisitor was very courteous to them, and promised their Liberty in a few Days, saying, <HI>He would send for the Consul, and get him to engage for five hundred Dollars to be paid for them if ever they came again. And in Case the Consul denied this, he would send to</HI> Rome <HI>to the Pope, to set them at Liberty without any Obligation.</HI></P>
<P>Not many Days after, the Inquisitor came with his Lieutenant, the Chancellor, and others, and after some Discourse, asked them, <HI>Whether they would return back again to their Husbands and Children, if it were the Will of God?</HI> To which they answered, <HI>It was their Intent in the Will of God so to do.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>K. Evans</HI> and <HI>Sar. Chevers</HI> are released.</NOTE> Hereupon they were released, and the Inquisitor took his Leave very courteously of them, and wished them a prosperous Return into their own Country; as likewise did the Magistrates, and the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erior Officers, not requiring one Pennyworth for Fees or Attendance; yet in their own Freedom they gave something to the Keeper, and some poor Men.</P>
<P>Being thus set at Liberty, they kneeled down, and prayed God never to lay to their Charge what they did unto them, because they knew them not. And then they were delivered into the Consul's Hands, who told them, that he had engaged for them to get them free; but they could never find that it was true. Now they were kept eleven Weeks at the Consul's House, before they could get Passage from thence. <HI>Ka∣tharine</HI> in the mean while being under a great Concern, because of a Judgment that was impending over the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Katharine</HI> writes to the Rulers of <HI>Malta,</HI> there∣to moved by the Lord.</NOTE> writ a Paper to the Ru∣lers of <HI>Malta,</HI> in which she said, that on the 25th of the Month called <HI>August</HI> it came upon her from the Lord to write thus to them in his Name; <Q>My Wrath is kindled against you, and my Judgment is set up amongst you, because of your Hardheartedness and Unbelief. I the Lord, who desire the Death of no Man, but that all should return unto me and live, have cast my Servants amongst you, contrary to their Will, and without their Knowledge, to go and forewarn you of the Evil that was coming upon you— For all the Wicked shall be brought to Judgment— I will establish my beloved Son upon his Throne, and he shall rule in his Princely Power, and reign in his kingly Majesty, whose Right it is over all, and his own spiritual Go∣vernment shall be set up in all Places, righteous Rule and pure Wor∣ship in Spirit and in Truth. There is nothing that can prevent the Lord, who saith, If ye will not hear my Servant, which speaketh my Word, whom ye have proved almost these four Years, whose Life hath been harmless and spotless, in pure Innocency amongst you, then will I bring Woe upon Woe, and Judgment upon Judgment upon you, till the Living shall not be able to bury the Dead. My Mouth hath spoken it, and my Zeal will perform it; and every Man's Hand shall be upon his Loins for Pain; for the Day of Recompence is come. But if you will hear my Servant, which speaketh in my

Name, and return in your Minds to the Light in your Consciences, which convinceth of all Sin, and deny all evil Thoughts, Words, and Actions, then will I pour out of my Spirit upon you, and will soon cure you of your Diseases, and heal you of your Pain.</Q></P>
<P>This and more she wrote, and delivered to the Consul to give it to the grand Master, and the rest of the Governours. But the Consul not being pleased with it, threatned her with Imprisonment again. What further became of the Paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dreadful Tempest and Earthquake at <HI>Malta.</HI></NOTE> I do not find, but this, that on the 8th of <HI>October</HI> there was great Thunder and Lightning, which set on Fire and blew up one of the Powder-houses about a Mile out of the City, and another Powder-house was thrown down; and in the City five Houses were overthrown, most of the Glass Windows of the Palaces and other Houses broke, the Doors lifted off their Hooks, the Walls torn, and the whole City terribly shaken, so that being at Midnight, a Cry went up thro' the whole City, and the Bells were rung. At the Bed's Feet where <HI>Katharine</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> lay, was a Glass Window, which also was broken, but they received no Hurt, tho' the House was so shaken, that they did exceedingly fear and quake; but being given up unto the Lord to live or to die, their Fear was soon taken from them, and turned into Joy in the Lord.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Consul visits them.</NOTE> When it was Day, the Consul came to them, and they being still and quiet, he asked whether they were not dead. And while he was speaking, others came in, telling what was done in the City; and he told them that even the Ships in the Harbour had suffered Damage. Then they said, <HI>One Woe is past, and behold another Woe cometh quickly, if ye do not repent.</HI></P>
<P>Some Days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sarah</HI> fasts, and desires the Grand Master to pro∣claim a Fast.</NOTE> <HI>Sarah</HI> fasted, sitting upon the Ground with Ashes upon her Head, her Neck and Shoulders bare, and she spoke to the Consul to desire the Grand Master <HI>to proclaim a Fast, and to make the Peo∣ple to meet together to wait upon the Lord, with their Minds turned to him; that so he might turn away his Judgments from them; for the Hour of his Judg∣ments was come, wherein the painted Harlot should be stripped naked, and receive a Cup of Trembling from the Hand of the Lord.</HI> The Consul performed this Message to the Magistrates; and the Friars said, the Women had a good Intent. Some Time after, the Inquisitor came, and talking with them, said, <HI>Your Intent is good, but the Devil hath deceived you.</HI> And they asked him, <HI>Whether the Devil could give Power over Sin?</HI> To which he said, <HI>The Devil could transform himself into an Angel of Light.</HI> This they assented to, but yet said, <HI>He could not hide himself from the Children of Light; tho' they that were in the dark could not discern him.</HI> He could not abide to hear this, but went away, and the Consul, who was present, wrought against them to get them into Bondage again, but in vain. Many now died in the Town of a violent Fever: Whether any other Disaster followed upon their Prediction, I can't tell.</P>
<P>At length there came one of the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Frigates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They go aboard an <HI>English</HI> Frigate, as do some Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> and the Inquisi∣tor's Brother, who is kind to them.</NOTE> called the <HI>Saphire,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>Samuel Titswel,</HI> who took them in, together with some Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> among which was the Inquisitor's Brother, who often spoke to the Captain, that they might not want any Thing that was in the Ship, and he told them, <HI>If they came to</HI> Mal∣ta <HI>again, they should not be persecuted so.</HI> And to the Captain he said, <HI>If they go to Heaven one Way, and we another, yet we shall all meet together at last.</HI> But they told him, that <HI>Christ Jesus, the Light of the World, was the only Way to the Father.</HI></P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Malta,</HI> after some Time they came to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> where the Merchants shewed them great Kindness, and sent Wine and other Things for their Refreshment, proffering them also Money; but they were unwilling to accept it. From thence they came to <HI>Tangier,</HI> which the King of <HI>England</HI> had in Marriage with the Daughter of the King of
<PB N="305" REF="003104_0316_0FEFF638978AFA40"/>
<HI>Portugal.</HI> This Place was at that Time besieged by the <HI>Moors,</HI> yet <HI>Ka∣tharine</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> enter'd the Town; and many came flocking into the House where they were lodged; for they boldly exhorted the People to depart from Wickedness. They also went to the Governor, who was courteous to them, and took their Admonitions in good Part, and promised to follow their Counsel. And he would have given them Money; but they took none, tho' they accepted his Love: For he com∣manded that none of the Garrison should abuse them either in Word or Deed, upon pain of severe Punishment. Yet the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> were ready enough to have done them a Mischief. They being inclined to go out to the <HI>Moors,</HI> desired the Governour to let them go forth; but he told them, they must expect from that savage People nothing but cruel Death or Bonds for ever. And tho' they signified to him, that they believed the Lord would preserve them, since they were persuaded that he required of them to go to the <HI>Moors,</HI> yet the Governor in a friendly Manner with-held them from going. Being thus stopt, they believed that the Lord accepted of their Good-will. When they went aboard again, tho' in another Ship, several took Shipping with them, from a Belief that on their Account they should have a safe Passage. The Captain, and others that were in the Ship behaved themselves very civilly towards them; and tho' they met with Tempests, yet at length they arrived safely in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Katharine</HI> afterwards related, that when (in the Inquisition) she was for many Days together in Expectation that they should be burnt, she saw in a Dream in the Night a large Room and a great Wood-Fire, in the Chimney; and she beheld one sitting in a Chair by the Fire, in the Form of a Servant, whom she took to be the eternal Son of God. Likewise she saw a very amiable well-favoured Man-child sitting in a hollow Chair over the Fire, (not appearing to be above three Quar∣ters of a Year old, and having no Cloaths on but a little fine Linnen about the upper Parts) and the Fire flamed about it; yet the Child played and was merry. She would then have taken it up, for fear it should have been burnt; but he that sat in the Chair bid her let it alone. Then turning about, she saw an Angel, and he that sat in the Chair bid her take up the Child, which she did, and found it had no Harm. And then awaking, she told her Dream to <HI>Sarah,</HI> and desired her not to fear, since the heavenly Host thus followed them.</P>
<P>I have collected this Relation of the Occurrences of these Women at <HI>Malta</HI> from several Papers and Letters, which not long after their Return Home, were published in Print. And since no due Order was observed there, and many things mentioned, which to avoid Prolixity, I have past by, as not very material, I may have haply miss'd in some Case or other, as to the Order or Series of Time, but yet I think the Matters of Fact are not mutilated. Now to give the Reader an Idea of the Frame of these Womens Minds and their Sufferings, I'll insert some of their Letters. Among those which they writ to their Friends in <HI>England,</HI> was this following;</P>
<P><Q>O Dearly beloved Friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter sent to their Friends in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> Fathers, and Elders, and Pillars of God's spiritual House, and Brethren and Sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Measure of Love and Life of our God, do we salute you all, and do embrace you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that which is eternal; and we do greatly rejoice, and glorify the Name of our heavenly Father, that he hath counted us worthy to be Partakers of the Death and Suffer∣ings of his blessed Son, with you; tho' we be the least of God's Flock, yet we are of the true Fold, whereof Christ Jesus is Shep∣herd;
<PB N="306" REF="003104_0317_0FEFF5F9EEE497C8"/>
and he hath had as tender a Care over us, as he hath had of any of his Lambs which he hath called forth in this the Day of his Power, and hath carried us thro' and over as great Afflictions as most of our Brethren and Sufferers for his Name, both in Mockings, Scoffings, Scornings, Reproaches, Stripes, Contradictions, Perils at Land, and Perils at Sea, fiery Trials, cruel Threatnings, Grief of Heart, Sorrow of Soul, Heats and Colds, Fastings and Watchings, Fears within, and Fightings without, terrible Temptations and Per∣secutions, and dreadful Imprisonments and Buffetings of Satan; yet in all these our Trials the Lord was very gracious unto us, and did not absent himself from us, neither suffered his Faithfulness to fail us, but did bear us up, and keep us from fainting in the Midst of our Extre∣mity. We had not another to make our Moan to, but the Lord alone, neither could we expect a Drop of Mercy, Favour or Refreshment, but what he did distil from his living Presence, and work by his own Strength; for we sat one in one Room, and the other in another, near a Year; as Owls in Desarts, and as People forsaken in solitary Places. Then did we enjoy the Presence of the Lord, and did behold the Brightness of his Glory, and we did see you, our dear Friends, in the Light of Jesus, and did behold your Order, and Stedfastness of your Faith and Love to all Saints, and were refreshed in all the Faithful-hearted, and felt the Issues of Love and Life which did stream from the Hearts of those that were wholly joined to the Fountain, and were made sensible of the Benefit of your Prayers.</Q></P>
<P>O the Sorrows, the Mournings, the Tears! But those that sow in Tears, shall reap in Joy. A true Sorrow begets a true Joy; and a true Cross, a true Crown: For when our Sorrows did abound, the Love of God did abound much more: The deeper the Sorrows, the greater the Joys; the greater the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ross, the weightier the Crown.</P>
<P>Dear Friends and Brethren, marvel not that <HI>Israel</HI> is not gathered, our Judgment remains with the Lord, and so do our Labours; for it was not for Want of Travel, nor Pain, nor Love to their Souls; for we could have been contented to have fed upon the Grass on the Ground, so we might have had our Freedom amongst them: For, had it not been for the great Opposition, they would have followed after us, as Chickens after a Hen, both great and small. But oh the swelling Seas, the raging and foaming Waves, stormy Winds and Floods, and deep Waters, and high Mountains and Hills, hard Rocks, rough Ways, and crooked Paths, tall Cedars, strong Oaks, fruitless Trees, and corrupted ones, that cumber the Ground, and hinder the righteous Seed to be sown, and the noble Plants from being planted: Oh! they shut up the Kingdom against the Simple-hearted, and hide the Key of Knowledge from the innocent ones, and will not enter into the King∣dom themselves, nor suffer them that would enter, but stir up the Ma∣gistrates to form carnal Weapons, thinking to prevent the Lord of taking to him his Inheritance, and to dispossess his Son, who is Heir of all, that he might not have a Dwelling-place among them, nor a Habitation nigh them; because that his Light will discover their Dark∣ness, and his Brightness will burn up all their Abominations, and marr their Beauty, and stain their Glory, their Pomp, and their Pride, that it may perish as the untimely Figs, and fall as the Flower of the Field, and wither as the Grass upon the House-top. Oh, the Belly of Hell, the Jaws of Satan, the whole Mystery of Iniquity is at the Height, and all Manner of Abomination that makes desolate, stands where it ought not, and is upholden by a Law, That upon Pain of Death none must speak against it, nor walk contrary to it. But Praises to our God, he carried us forth to declare against it daily. Oh, the blind Guides,
<PB N="307" REF="003104_0318_0FEFF63A303BA030"/>
the seducing Spirits, that do cause the People to err, and compel them to worship the Beast and his Image, and have his Mark in their Fore∣heads, and in their Hands, and to bow to Pictures, and painted Walls, and to worship the Things of their own Hands, and to fall down to that which their own Fingers have fashioned, and will not suffer them to look towads <HI>Sion</HI> upon Pain of Death, nor to walk towards <HI>Jerusalem</HI> upon Pain of Faggot and Fire, but must abide in <HI>Babel,</HI> and believe whatsoever they speak or do, to be Truth. But oh the Ways, the Worships, the Fashions, Forms, Customs, Traditions, Observations, and Imaginations which they have drawn in by their dark Divinations, to keep the poor People in Blindness and Ignorance, so that they perish for Want of Knowledge, and are corrupted, be∣cause the Way of Truth is not made known among them; they are all in the many Ways, out of the one true and living Way, and their Ways be so many, and so monstrous, that they are unrehearsable; but the Lord our God hath kindled a Fire in the Midst of them, that will consume all Forms, Fashions, Customs, and Traditions of Men, and will burn up the Briars, Thorns, and Tares, Stubble, and fruitless Trees and corrupted ones, and will blast all the Fruits, Works, and Labours of wicked and and ungodly Men, with the Mildews of his wrathful Indignation, and will scatter all his Enemies with the Whirl-winds of his Displeasure. They do not know the Scriptures: Their Bibles would grieve any honest Heart to behold them, because of the Corruption.</P>
<P>This Letter was signed by both of them, tho' perhaps <HI>Katharine</HI> was the Writer, who also writ a Letter of Exhortation to the <HI>Popish</HI> Inqui∣sitor at <HI>Malta,</HI> and another to Friar <HI>Malachy.</HI> Among the Letters she writ to her Husband and Children, I count the following really worthy to be delivered to Posterity.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>For the Hands of <HI>John Evans,</HI> my right dear and precious Husband, with my tender-hearted Children, who are more dear and precious to me than the Apple of mine Eye.</HEAD>
<P>MOST dear and faithful Husband,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter of <HI>Katharine</HI>'s to her Hus∣band and Chil∣dren.</NOTE> Friend, and Brother, begotten of my eternal Father, of the immortal Seed of the Covenant of Light, Life and Blessedness, I have Ʋnity and Fellowship with thee Day and Night, to my great Refreshment, and continual Comfort, Praises, Praises be given to our God for evermore, who hath joined us together in that, which neither Sea nor Land can separate or divide.</P>
<P>My dear Heart, my Soul doth dearly salute thee, with my dear and precious Children, which are dear and precious in the Light of the Lord, to thy endless Joy, and my everlasting Comfort; Glory be to our Lord God eternally, who hath called you with a holy Calling, and hath caused his Beauty to shine upon you, in this the Day of his Power, wherein he is making up of his Jewels, and binding up of his faithful Ones in the Bond of everlasting Love and Salvation, among whom he hath numbred you of his own free Grace; in which I beseech you (dear Hearts) in the Fear of the Lord to abide in your Measures, according to the Manifestation of the Revelation of the Son of God, in you; keep a diligent Watch over every Thought, Word, and Action, and let your Minds be staid continually in the Light, where you will find out the Snares and Baits of Satan, and be preserved out of his Traps, Nets, and Pits, that you may not be captivated by him at his Will. Oh, my dear Husband and Children, how often have I poured out my Soul to our ever∣lasting Father for you, with Rivers of Tears, Night and Day, that you might be kept pure and single in the Sight of our God, improving your Talents as wise Vir∣gins, having Oil in your Vessels, and your Lamps burning, and cloathed with the long white Robes of Righteousness, ready to enter the Bed-chamber, and to sup with
<PB N="308" REF="003104_0319_0FEFF5FD0D3DC928"/>
the Lamb, and to feed at the Feast of fat Things, where your Souls may be nourish∣ed, refreshed, comforted, and sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied, never to hunger again.</P>
<P>My dear Hearts, you do not want teaching, you are in a Land of Blessed∣ness, which floweth with Milk and Honey, among the faithful Stewards, whose Mouths are opened wide in Righteousness, to declare the eternal Mysteries of the everlasting Kingdom, of the endless Joys, and eternal Glory; whereinto all the Willing and Obedient shall enter, and be blessed for ever.</P>
<P>My dear Hearts, the Promises of the Lord are large, and are all▪ <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen</HI> to those that fear his Name; he will comfort the Mourners in <HI>Sion,</HI> and will cause the heavy-hearted in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to rejoice, because of the Glad-ty∣dings: They that do bear the Cross with Patience, shall wear the Crown with Joy; for it is thro' the Long-suffering and patient Waitings, the Crown of Life and Immortality comes to be obtained. The Lord hath exercised my Patience, and tried me to the uttermost, to his Praise, and my eternal Comfort, who hath not been wanting to us in any Thing in his own due Time; we are Witnesses he can provide a Table in the Wilderness, both spiritual and temporal. Oh, the endless Love of our God, who is an everlasting Fountain of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing Refresh∣ment, whose Chrystal Streams never cease running to every thirsty Soul, that breatheth after the Springs of Life and Salvation!</P>
<P>In our deepest Affliction, when I looked for every Breath to be the last, I could not wish I had not come over Sea, because I knew it was my eternal Father's Will to prove me, with my dear and faithful Friend; in all Afflictions and Mi∣series the Lord remembered Mercy, and did not leave nor forsake us, nor suffer his Faithfulness to fail us, but caused the sweet Drops of his Mercy to distil upon us, and the Brightness of his glorious Countenance to shine into our Hearts, and was never wanting to us in Revelations or Visions. Oh, how may I do to set forth the Fulness of God's Love to our Souls! No Tongue can express it, no Heart can conceive it, nor Mind can comprehend it. Oh, the Ravishments, the Raptures, the glorious bright-shining Countenance of our Lord God, who is our Fulness in Emptiness, our Strength in Weakness, our Health in Sickness, our Life in Death, our Joy in Sorrow, our Peace in Disquietness, our Praise in Heaviness, our Power in all Needs or Necessities; he alone is a full God unto us, and to all that can trust him; he hath emptied us of our selves, and hath unbottomed us of our selves, and hath wholly built us upon the sure Foundation, the Rock of Ages, Christ Jesus, the Light of the World, where the swelling Seas, nor raging, foam∣ing Waves, nor stormy Winds, tho' they beat vehemently, can he able to remove us. Glory, Honour, and Praise is to our God for ever, who out of his everlasting Treasures, doth fill us with his eternal Riches Day by Day; he did nourish our Souls with the choicest of his Mercies, and doth feed our Bodies with his good Crea∣tures, and relieve all our Necessities in a full Measure; Praises, Praises be to him alone, who is our everlasting Portion, our Confidence, and our Rejoicing, whom we serve acceptably with Reverence and Godly Fear; for our God is a consuming Fire.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear Husband, and precious Children, you may feel the Issues of Love and Life, which stream forth as a River to every Soul of you, from a Heart that is wholly joined to the Fountain! My Prayers are for you Day and Night without ceasing, beseeching the Lord God of Power to pour down his tender Mercies upon you, and to keep you in his pure Fear, and to encrease your Faith, to confirm you in all Righteousness, and strengthen you in believing in the Name of the Lord God Almighty, that you may be established as <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> that can never be moved. Keep your Souls unspotted of the World, and love one another with a pure Heart fervently, serve one another in Love, build up one another in the eternal, and bear one another's Burdens for the Seed's-Sake, and so fulfil the Law of God. This is the Word of the Lord unto you, my dearly Beloved.</P>
<P>Dear Hearts, I do commit you into the Hands of the Almighty, who dwelleth on high, and to the Word of his Grace in you, who is able to build you up to ever∣lasting Life, and eternal Salvation. By me, who am thy dear and precious Wife, and Spouse, in the Marriage of the Lamb, in the Bed undefiled,</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY Dear Husband,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sarah</HI>'s Letter to her Hus∣band and Children.</NOTE> my Love, my Life is given up to serve the living God, and to obey his pure Call in the Measure of the Manifestation of his Love, Light, Life and Spirit of Christ Jesus, his only begotten Son, whom he hath manifested in me, and thousands, by the Brightness of his Appearing, to put an End to Sin and Satan, and bring to Light Immortality, thro' the Preach∣ing of the everlasting Gospel, by the Spirit of Prophecy, which is poured out upon the Sons and Daughters of the living God, according to his Purpose; whereof he hath chosen me, who am the least of all: But God, who is rich in Mercy, for his own Name-sake hath passed by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne Offences, and hath counted me worthy to bear Testimony to his holy Name, before the mighty Men of the Earth. Oh the Love of the Lord to my Soul! My Tongue cannot express, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, to conceive of the Things that God hath laid up for them that fear him.</P>
<P>Therefore doth my Soul breathe to my God for thee and my Children, Night and Day, that your Minds may be joined to the Light of the Lord Jesus, to lead you out of Satan's Kingdom, into the Kingdom of God, where we may enjoy one another in the Life eternal, where neither Sea nor Land can separate; in which Light and Life do I salute thee my dear Husband, with my Children, wish∣ing you to embrace God's Love, in making his Truth so clearly manifest amongst you; whereof I am a Witness, even of the everlasting Fountain that hath been o∣pened by the Messengers of Christ, who preach to you the Word of God, in Season and out of Season, directing you where you may find your Saviour to purge and cleanse you from your Sins, and to reconcile you to his Father, and to have Ʋnity with him and all the Saints, in the Light, that ye may be Fellow-Citizens in the Kingdom of Glory, Rest and Peace, which Christ hath purchased for them that love him, and obey him. What Profit is there for to gain the whole World, and lose your own Souls? Seek first the Kingdom of God and the Righteous∣ness thereof, and all other Things shall be added to you. Godliness is great Gain, having the Promise of this Life that now is, and that which is to come; which is fulfilled to me, who have tasted of the Lord's endless Love and Mercies to my Soul; and from a moving of the same Love and Life do I breathe to thee my Dear Husband, with my Children; my dear Love salutes you all; my Prayers to my God are for you all, that your Minds may be joined to the Light, wherewith you are lightned, that I may enjoy you in that which is eternal, and have Communion with you in the Spirit. He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit, one Heart, one Mind, one Soul, to serve the Lord with one Consent. I cannot by Pen nor Paper set forth the large Love of God in fulfilling his gra∣tious Promises to me in the Wilderness, being put into Prison for God's Truth, there to remain all Days of my Life, being searched, tried, examined upon pain of Death among the Enemies of God and his Truth; standing in Jeopardy for my Life until the Lord had subdued and brought them under by his mighty Power, and made them to feed us, and would have given us Money or Clothes; but the Lord did deck our Table richly in the Wilderness. The Day of the Lord is appearing, wherein he will discover every Deed of Darkness, let it be done never so secretly▪ the Light of Christ Jesus will make it manifest in every Conscience; the Lord will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip up all Coverings that are not of his own Spirit. The God of Peace be with you all, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

Several other Letters both she and <HI>Katharine</HI> writ to their Husbands, Friends, and Relations. But since great Part of my Narrative was fetch'd from thence, I pass them by. But by these inserted, one may see that they were not Women of a dull Temper, but ingenious and chearful.</P>
<P>In a Letter of <HI>Sarah</HI>'s to her Friends in <HI>Ireland,</HI> I find these Words:</P>
<P><Q>My Life is given up to the Service of the Lord: Bonds, Chains, Bolts, Irons, double Doors, Death it self is too little for the Testimo∣ny of Jesus, and for the Word of God; so the Seed be gathered, it is but a reasonable Sacrifice. Bonds and Afflictions beside the Gospel of Christ. Those that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer Persecu∣tion.</Q> And in a Letter to <HI>Daniel Baker, Katharine</HI> said,</P>
<P><Q>The Time is too little for me to disclose the twentieth Part of the terrible Trials; but whensoever we were brought upon any Trial, the Lord did take away all Fear from us, and multiplied our Strength, and gave us Power and Boldness to plead for the Truth of the Lord Jesus, and Wisdom of Words to stop the Mouths of the Gainsayers; but then they would say, <HI>We had not the true Faith, but we had all Vir∣tues.</HI> Dearly beloved, pray for us, that we fall not, nor fail, where∣by our Enemies may have any Advantage to rejoice, and say, we served a God that could not save us, and called upon a God that could not deliver us; as if we were like them, to call upon Stocks, Stones, Pictures, and painted Walls, and dead Things, that cannot hear, see, nor speak. We do beseech thee to tell all our dear Friends, Fathers and Elders, the Pillars of the spiritual Building, with all the rest of our Christian Brethren, that we do desire their Prayers, for we have need of them.</Q></P>
<P>This Letter they concluded with the following Poem:</P>
<LG>
<L>HOW strong and pow'rful is our KING,</L>
<L>To all that do believe in him?</L>
<L>He doth preserve them from the Snare,</L>
<L>And Teeth of those that would them tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We that are Suff'rers for the Seed,</L>
<L>Our Hearts are wounded, and do bleed,</L>
<L>To see th' Oppression, Cruelty</L>
<L>Of Man that do thy Truth deny.</L>
<L>In Prisons strong, and Dungeons deep,</L>
<L>To God alone we cry and weep:</L>
<L>Our Sorrows none can learn nor read,</L>
<L>But those that in our Bath do tread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But he whose Beauty shineth bright,</L>
<L>Who turneth Darkness into Light,</L>
<L>Makes Cedars bow, and Oaks to bend</L>
<L>To him, that's sent to the same End;</L>
<L>He is a Fountain pure and clear,</L>
<L>His Christal Streams run far and near,</L>
<L>To cleanse all those that come to him,</L>
<L>For to be healed of their Sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All them that patiently abide,</L>
<L>And never swerve nor go aside;</L>
<L>The Lord will free them out of all</L>
<L>Bondage, Captivity and Thrall.</L>
</LG>
<P>They, composed several other Poems, which fell into the Hands of their Enemies, and Copies of them were given to the Inquisitor. But now I leave them; and yet before I return to Transactions in <HI>England,</HI> I shall relate a singular Case of</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="003104_0322_0FEFF63EC8BAECA0"/><HI>Daniel Baker,</HI> who being come to <HI>Smirna,</HI> with Intent to travel from thence to <HI>Constantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D. Baker</HI> in∣tending for <HI>England</HI> is moved to go to <HI>Malta.</HI></NOTE> was stopt by the <HI>English</HI> Consul, and sent to the Isle of <HI>Zant,</HI> where a Ship lay bound for <HI>Venice,</HI> in which he embark∣ed, and coming into that City, he staid there a Week, and went from thence to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> with Intent to take Shipping there for <HI>England:</HI> But during his Stay in that Place, he inwardly felt Drawings towards <HI>Malta,</HI> to try whether he could be helpful to <HI>Katharine</HI> and <HI>Sarah</HI> that were Prisoners there, since he had several Times been stirr'd up thereto; and tho' the Difficulty of the Matter had kept him back, yet he could not have Peace in his Mind, before he gave himself up to that Service; and so he embarked in a <HI>French</HI> Ship for <HI>Sicily:</HI> And coming at <HI>Syra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use,</HI> he staid there five Days, and then they set Sail for <HI>Malta;</HI> where being arrived, he got Admittance to the Pope's Inquisitor, to whom he spoke in the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue on this wise, <HI>I am come to demand the just Liberty of my innocent Friends, the</HI> English <HI>Women in Prison in the Inquisition.</HI> The Inqui∣sitor asked him, <HI>If he were related to them as a Husband or Kinsman, and whether he came out of</HI> England <HI>on Purpose with that Message.</HI> To this <HI>Daniel</HI> answered, <HI>That he came from</HI> Leghorn <HI>for that same End.</HI> But the Inquisi∣tor told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He in vain so∣licites the two <HI>English</HI> Wo∣mens Release.</NOTE> <HI>They should abide in Prison till they died, except some</HI> English <HI>Merchants or others that were able, would engage for the Value of three or four Thousand Dollars, that they should never return into those Parts.</HI> His Request being thus denied, he went to the <HI>English</HI> Consul, and spoke with him and several others: But all his Endeavours proved vain; and he him∣self was threatned with the Inquisition;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is in Danger of the Inquisi∣tion.</NOTE> and the Pope's Deputy would have had him bound, that he should neither speak Good nor Evil to any Body while he was on the Island, save to him and the Consul.</P>
<P>After a Stay here of three Weeks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From thence goes to <HI>Italy,</HI> and there em∣barks for <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></NOTE> he passed again to <HI>Italy,</HI> and from thence took Shipping for <HI>England:</HI> But being come into the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> he saw that the high Mountain there, was the same Place he had seen the foregoing Year in a Dream, when Prisoner in <HI>Worcester</HI> Jail in <HI>England.</HI> Here the Ship wherein he was, with several other Vessels lay about a Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is Wind-bound at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI></NOTE> because of the contrary Wind, so that they could not set set Sail. In the mean While being under a Burthen, he perceived there was a Service for him ashore; but considering this to be dangerous, he wish'd to have been excused of it; but felt no Peace before he fully gave up, whatever either Bonds or Death might ensue. Whilst the Fleet lay here Wind-bound, divers Ships attempted to pass through, but could not: And the like Temptation attended him as that of <HI>Jonah, viz.</HI> to flee from the Place, and so to escape the Burden under which he laboured. But he found, as he afterwards signified in a prin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Relation, that Obedience was his Duty, tho' it was required of him to be a Sign against the Idolatry of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> He then told the Master of the Ship in which he was a Passenger, something of the Matter, and said that he believed, that God would soon give Opportu∣nity for the Fleet to pass away, after this Service was performed. The Master was hard to be persuaded to put him ashore, yet at length he suffered it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes ashore and in a Mass-house publickly tes∣tifies against Idolatry.</NOTE> upon the Day they used to call <HI>Maunday Thursday.</HI> Being now landed, he went to the Town, and so into the Mass-house, where he found the Priest at the high Altar, upon his Knees, in his white Surplice, adoring the Host. After he had a While been viewing this Idolatry, he felt the Indignation of God kindled in his Heart against it: And turning his Back upon the Priest and his dead God, he set his Face towards the People, and saw the Multitude upon their Knees also, worshipping they knew not what. In this Posture, spreading forth his Arms, he slipt off his upper Garment, and rent it from Top to Bottom in divers Pieces, which he cast from him with Indignation: Then he took his Hat from off his Head, as being the uppermost Covering of

Man; and casting it down, stamped upon it with his Feet, and appear∣ing in Sack-cloth Covering, he with a loud Voice thrice sounded Repent∣ance, and said, That <HI>the Life of Christ and his Saints was risen from the Dead.</HI> And so he passed away unmolested, sounding the same Message with Repentance thro' the Streets, till he came to the Sea-side, where he kneeled down to pray, and give Thanks to the Lord for his wonderful Preservation, and that he had suffered no Man to touch or do him any Harm.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Delivers a Paper to the Governor.</NOTE> Being on Shore, he delivered a Paper written in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue, to the Governor and Inhabitants of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> with some <HI>La∣tin</HI> Books. That to the Governor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was as followeth;</P>
<P><HI>Behold, behold, the great Day of God is come, and of his Wrath, and of the Wrath of his Lamb. The Hour of his Judgment is come. Wherefore O Inha∣bitants of the Earth, Repent, Repent, Repent, fear God, and give Glory and Honour to him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Fountains of Waters. Woe, Woe, Woe to the Inhabitants of the Earth. <HI>John</HI> heard another Voice from Heaven saying, Come out of her my People, that ye partake not of her Sins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues. These are the Words of the Power of Christ, that is contrary to the false Church. Behold, behold, Plagues, Plagues, Plagues are coming upon the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>and upon her Heads in all Parts of the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Daniel</HI> being now come again on Ship-board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At length re∣turns to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and is imprisoned soon after.</NOTE> the next Day the Lord gave them a fair Wind, and all the Fleet set Sail; and after some Time he arrived safe in <HI>England.</HI> But being come to <HI>London,</HI> it was not long, ere he, who had travelled without Hurt in Foreign Parts, was impri∣soned by his Country-men, as will be related hereafter: And being shut up in Prison, he wrote a Narrative of his Travels, from which I took my Relation.</P>
<P>About this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Stubbs</HI> re∣turns from <HI>Turky.</HI></NOTE> <HI>John Stubbs</HI> returned into <HI>England,</HI> having been in the Dominions of the <HI>Great Turk.</HI> But I do not find that he met with any singular Occurrences, but that he had spread some Books. He and <HI>Alexander Parker</HI> coming to <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He and <HI>A. Parker</HI> travel with <HI>G. Fox</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> where Friends Meetings are disturbed, and <HI>A. Park∣er</HI> taken a∣way.</NOTE> found <HI>G. Fox</HI> there, with whom they travelled towards <HI>Bristol.</HI> By the Way they had several Meetings, and being come to <HI>Bristol,</HI> they understood that the Officers were likely to come and disturb the Meeting. Yet on the First-day of the Week they went thither, and <HI>A. Parker</HI> stood up first to preach; but while he was speaking, the Officers came and took him away. Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> stood up, and preached undisturbed, so that the Meeting ended peacea∣bly. And he staying in Town that Week, visited his Friends, and was visited by them. The next First-day, some of his Friends came to him, and endeavoured to persuade him not to go to the Meeting that Day; for, said they, <HI>The Magistrates have threatened to take thee away, and in Order thereto have raised the train'd Bands. G. Fox</HI> desired them to go their Way to the Meeting, without telling them what he intended to do. Yet not long after, he went thither, But being met by some of his Friends, they did what they could to stop him: And <HI>what,</HI> said one, <HI>Wilt thou go into the Mouth of the Beast?</HI> Wilt thou <HI>go into the Mouth of the Dragon?</HI> said another. But <HI>G. Fox</HI> would not suffer himself to be thus prevented; but went on. being come thither, he perceived a Concern and Fear upon his Friends for him, but his preaching there was so powerful, that all Fear departed from them: And having con∣cluded his Sermon with a Prayer, he stood up again, and told the Au∣ditory, now they might see there was a God in <HI>Israel</HI> that could de∣liver: For the Officers and Soldiers had been breaking up another Meeting, which had taken up their Time: And they were in a great Rage that they had missed him. For it was resolved on now to perse∣cute the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and if possible, to root them out.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="003104_0324_0FEFF6414B625268"/><HI>G. Fox,</HI> after having tarried yet some Days at <HI>Bristol,</HI> went thro' <HI>Wiltshire</HI> and <HI>Barkshire</HI> back again to <HI>London:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> goes thence back to <HI>London,</HI> thence toward <HI>Leicester∣shire,</HI> and vi∣sits Captain <HI>Brown,</HI> a <HI>Baptist;</HI> of whom some∣what remark∣able.</NOTE> Yet he did not stay long there, but travelled toward <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> and passing by <HI>Barnet</HI> Hills, he found there one Captain <HI>Brown</HI> a <HI>Baptist,</HI> whose Wife belonged to the Society of those called <HI>Quakers.</HI> This Captain, for Fear his Wife should go to Meetings, and be cast into Prison, had left his House at <HI>Barrow,</HI> and taken a Place on the said Hills, thinking himself more safe there. <HI>G. Fox</HI> going to see his Wife, and being come into the House, askt him <HI>How he did? How I do,</HI> said he, <HI>The Plagues and Vengeance of God are upon me, a Runagate, a</HI> Cain <HI>as I am: God may look for a Witness for me, and such as me; for if all were no faithfuller than I, God would have no Wit∣ness left in the Earth.</HI> In this Condition <HI>Brown</HI> lived there on Bread and Water, and thought it too good for him; but at length he returned with his Wife to his own House at <HI>Barrow,</HI> where he came to be convinced of the Truth professed by those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and died in it; and a little before his Death he said, <HI>That tho' he had not born a Tes∣timony for Truth in his Life, he would bear a Testimony in his Death:</HI> De∣siring to be buried in his Orchard in a plain way.</P>
<P>But I return to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> who being come into <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> went to <HI>Swanington</HI> to the House of a Widow Woman, where at Night came one call'd the Lord <HI>Beaumont</HI> and a Company of Soldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> taken out of a Friend's House at <HI>Swa∣nington</HI> by the <HI>L. Beaumont</HI> and a Compa∣ny of Soldiers, and commit∣ted to <HI>Leice∣ster</HI> Jail.</NOTE> who took him out of the Hall where he was, and brought him to the said Lord, who askt him his Name; to which he answered, <HI>My Name is</HI> George Fox, <HI>and I am well known by that Name. Ay,</HI> said <HI>Beaumont, You are known all, the World over.</HI> Then he put his Hands into <HI>George</HI>'s Pockets to search them, and pull'd out his Comb-case, and afterwards commanded one of the Officers to search for Letters: Which made <HI>G. Fox</HI> say, That <HI>he was no Letter-carrier,</HI> asking him, <HI>Why he came amongst a peaceable Peo∣ple with Swords and Pistols without a Constable?</HI> since this was contrary to the King's Proclamation; and it could not be said, there was a Meet∣ing; for <HI>G. Fox</HI> had been talking in the Hall only with the Widow Woman and her Daughter. <HI>Beaumont</HI> sending then for the Constables, gave them Charge to watch <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and some that were with him, that Night: Accordingly the Constables set a Watch upon them, and next Morning brought them to <HI>Beaumont</HI>'s House, who then told them, they met contrary to the Act: For not long before this Time, the Parlia∣ment, by the Instigation of the Clergy, had made an Act against Con∣venticles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act against Conventicles.</NOTE> containing that <Q>If any were convicted of having been at a Conventicle, they should incur a Fine not exceeding Five Pounds, or Imprisonment not above three Months.</Q> <HI>G. Fox</HI> saying to the "Lord <HI>Beaumont,</HI> that he did not find them in a Meeting, and so there was no Transgression of the said Act. <HI>Beaumont</HI> asked him, <HI>Whether he would take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy?</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> answer∣ed, <HI>I never took any Oath in all my Life.</HI> And desired him to shew that Oath, that they might see whether it was not for the Discovery of <HI>Popish</HI> Recusants. But <HI>Beaumont</HI> being unwilling, caused a <HI>Mittimus</HI> to be made, which mentioned, <HI>That they were to have had a Meeting:</HI> A cun∣ning Artifice indeed to vex an innocent People. And with the <HI>Mitti∣mus</HI> he charged the Constables to convey them to <HI>Leicester</HI> Jail. The Constable who was charged to bring <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his Friends to Prison, was loth to do it himself: And being Harvest-Time, it was hard to get any Body to go with them. And therefore they would have given them the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> to carry it themselves to the Jailor. This they re∣fused; tho' sometimes some of their Friends had done so: For the Constables had such Experience of their Fidelity, that they durst trust them even in such a Case, without fearing the Bird would escape. Then the Constable hired a poor Man, who was loth to go with them
<PB N="314" REF="003104_0325_0FEFF605A3CE7548"/>
on this Errand. Yet they rid with him thro' the Country, being five in Number, and some carried their Bibles open in their Hands, and passing thro' Towns, they told People, <HI>They were the Prisoners of the Lord Jesus Christ, going to suffer Bonds for his Name's-sake.</HI> Being come to <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI> and gone into an Inn, the Master of the House seemed somewhat troubled that they should go to Prison; but they being unwilling to consult with Lawyers, to which they were advised, suffered themselves to be had to Prison;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox,</HI> with others, impri∣son'd at <HI>Lei∣cester.</HI></NOTE> where being come, <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked, <HI>Whether the Jai∣lor, or his Wife was Master?</HI> and it was told him, <HI>The Wife;</HI> who, tho' she was lame, and not able to go without Crutches, yet would beat her Husband when he came within her reach, if he did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as she would have him.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> perceiving from this, that without her Leave he should not be able to agree with her Husband, got some body to bargain with her for a Room, for him and his Friends, and to leave it to them to give her what they would; to which she consented. But then it was told the Prisoners, the Jailor would not suffer them to fetch any Drink out of the Town into the Prison; but what Beer they drank, they must take it of him, and that, as was easily to be guess'd, should be at a dear Rate.</P>
<P>This made <HI>G. Fox</HI> say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They use Wa∣ter and Wormwood for Drink.</NOTE> he could remedy that; for since the Jailor could not deny them Water, he would get a Pail of it once a Day, and put some Wormwood into it; and that might serve their Turn. So long as <HI>G. Fox</HI> was in Prison there, he and his Friends had a Meeting every First Day of the Week in the Yard, to which came not only the Debtors and Felons, that were Prisoners, but also several People out of the Town and Country; whereby many were convinced of the Truth he preached, and continued to be faithful Witnesses for it.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was confined there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Friends sent to the same Jail.</NOTE> several more of his Friends were sent to Prison, to the Number of about Twenty. And when the Sessi∣ons came, they were brought before the Justices, who tender'd to them the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Trial.</NOTE> For this was the ordinary Snare, when no other Thing could be found to lay hold on. But <HI>G. F.</HI> told them, <HI>he never took any Oath in his Life; and ye know we cannot swear, because Christ and his Apostle forbid it: And therefore this is but as a Snare to us; yet if ye can prove, that after Christ and his Apostles forbad Swearing, they did ever command Christians to swear, then we will take these Oaths; otherwise we are resolved to obey Christ's Command, and the Apostle's Exhorta∣tion.</HI> To this it was returned, That <HI>they must take the Oath to manifest their Allegiance to the King. G. Fox,</HI> to shew that he was not unfaithful to the King, told them, that formerly he had been sent up a Prisoner by Colonel <HI>Hacker,</HI> from that Town to <HI>London,</HI> under Pretence that he held Meetings to plot for bringing in King <HI>Charles.</HI> Then he desired, that their <HI>Mittimus</HI> might be read, which set forth the Cause of their Commitment to be, That <HI>they were to have a Meeting:</HI> And he said also, <HI>that the Lord</HI> Beaumont <HI>could not by the Act send them to Jail, unless they had been taken at a Meeting;</HI> and therefore he urged the reading of the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> that it might be seen how wrongfully they were imprisoned. But whatever he said, they would not take Notice of the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> but called a Jury, and indicted the Prisoners for refusing to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. When the Jury was sworn and instructed, and as they were going out, one that been an Alderman spoke to them, and recommended to them to <HI>have a good Conscience:</HI> But one of the Jury, being a peevish Man, told the Justices, there was one affronted the Jury. Whereupon he was called up, and to try whether he was a <HI>Quaker,</HI> the Oath was also tendered to him, and he took it; thus the Snare intended against him did not hold.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="003104_0326_0FEFF64392E41EE0"/>Whilst the Prisoners stood waiting, a Cut-purse had put his Hand into the Pockets of some of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pick-pocket taken in the Fact, and let go.</NOTE> which they told the Justices of, and shewed them the Man. They then called him up, and upon Examina∣tion he could not deny the Fact, yet they let him go free; just as if the robbing of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> was no Crime.</P>
<P>It was not long before the Jury returned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are found guilty.</NOTE> and brought the Prisoners in guilty. And then the Justices whispered together, and bad the Jai∣lor take the Prisoners, and carry them back to Jail. But a little after, they were in Prison again, the Jailor came to them, and said, <HI>Gentle∣men, it is the Court's Pleasure that ye should all be set at Liberty,</HI> &amp;c. Thus they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> released on a sudden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet released.</NOTE> which was indeed remarkable, because the Jury had brought them in guilty; on which passing of Sentence must have followed. But <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Liberty seems to have been owing to the following Cause. He had a Letter from the Lord <HI>Hastings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And why.</NOTE> who having heard of his Imprisonment, had written from <HI>London</HI> to the Justices of the Sessions to set him at Liberty. This Letter he had not as yet delivered to the Justices, who perhaps had some Knowledge of the said Lord's Mind from another Hand, which made them resolve on this sudden Discharge. <HI>G. Fox</HI> being now free, carried this Letter to the Lord <HI>Beaumont,</HI> who having opened, and read it, seemed some∣what troubled; and yet threatned him, if he had any more Meetings at <HI>Swanington,</HI> he would disperse them, and send him to Prison again. But notwithstanding these Threatnings, he and his Friends went to <HI>Swanington,</HI> and had a Meeting there, without being disturbed. From thence he travelled to <HI>London,</HI> where we will leave him, and in the mean while see what happened elsewhere.</P>
<P>Some Time before,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Goodair</HI> and <HI>B. Staples</HI> in Prison at <HI>Oxford.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Thomas Goodair</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Staples</HI> were impri∣soned at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and being brought into the Court of Judicature before Sir <HI>William Walter,</HI> who sate there as Judge, and <HI>Goodair</HI> being examin∣ed, and nothing found against him, the Oath of Allegiance was tender'd, to which he answered, <Q>That he acknowledged the King as supreme Ruler in Civil Temporal Matters, and that he was willing to obey him in all just Commands. But, said he, if King <HI>Charles,</HI> and those who are in Authority under him, enjoyn me any Thing contrary to the Command of Christ, then I will rather obey Christ than King <HI>Charles,</HI> or those in Authority under him. It is for Conscience-sake that I can't swear, tho' I could gain the whole World thereby; for Christ hath forbidden it, and said, <HI>Swear not at all;</HI> and <HI>James</HI> saith, <HI>Above all Things, swear not.</HI></Q> But whatever <HI>Goodair</HI> said, was in vain, for they would needs have him swear. He continuing to refuse Swear∣ing, Justice <HI>Walter</HI> asked those who were with him on the Bench, whe∣ther they had any Thing to say against his passing Sentence against them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are out∣lawed for re∣fusing to swear, and deprived of all their Pos∣sessions.</NOTE> to which they having said, <HI>No,</HI> he spoke thus to <HI>Goodair: Heark∣en to your Sentence. You are out of the King's Protection. All your Lands, real Estate and Chattels, are forfeited, and shall be seized for the King's Ʋse; and you are to remain Prisoner during the King's Pleasure.</HI> Then he bid the Jailor take <HI>Goodair</HI> away. And <HI>Goodair</HI> asked whether the Jailor had Charge to fetter him; for he had been fetter'd as Thieves and Felons, before he was brought into the Court. Whereupon the Judge answer∣ed, <HI>The Jailor may do with you what he will: For you are now out of the King's Protection.</HI> Then he was led away, and <HI>B. Staples</HI> brought to the Bar, to whom the Oath being also tendered, and he refusing to take it, the same Sentence was pass'd on him. Both being returned to Prison, the Jailor said to the other Prisoners that were there for Evil or Debts, <HI>If ye want Coats, ye may take those of the</HI> Quakers; <HI>for they are now out of the Pro∣tection of the Law.</HI> But one of the Prisoners was so honest as to say, <HI>He would rather go naked, than take away those Men's Cloaths.</HI> How long

In the mean while, the aforesaid Priest <HI>Letch∣ford</HI> summoned <HI>Rigg</HI>'s Wife for Tithes; and she refusing Payment, was also imprisoned at the Prosecution of this Priest; and then he seized her Goods, taking away also that which her Husband had earned in Prison by his Hand-Labour, not leaving him and his Wife a Bed to lie on; nay, he also took away a Pot they had borrowed from other Priso∣ners to boil Victuals in, and vaunted he had <HI>Rigg</HI> so fast, that it was not in the King's Power to release him. But notwithstanding his wick∣ed Boast, yet to his great Disquiet and Vexation he lived to see <HI>Rigg</HI> re∣leased by the King under the great Seal.

<P>This Act caused <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> to write a small Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> writes an A∣pology for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and against Perse∣cution.</NOTE> called, <HI>The Case of the People called</HI> Quakers <HI>stated,</HI> to shew the Falshood of the Accusations charged upon them. First he shewed in this Treatise, that suppose the <HI>Quakers</HI> were Hereticks and erroneous People, which was never yet pro∣ved; yet we found no Examples in Scripture that such should be im∣prisoned, or afflicted with corporal Punishments. Having treated of this Matter at large, he laid down the State of their Way of Meeting and Worship, appealing to others on this Account, with these Words:</P>
<Q><P>What Judgment do our Neighbours give in this Case? they say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Burroughs</HI> shews <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> Meet∣ings are not dangerous.</NOTE> concerning our Meetings, <HI>That they have known us to meet together in such Manner, for divers Years, in Towns and Villages, and never knew, nor under∣stood of any Harm or Danger therein, nor ever were any way prejudiced, ei∣ther in their Persons or Estates, in our Meetings.</HI> The very <HI>Witness of God</HI> in all our Neighbours does testify, and give Judgment, that our Meetings have always been peaceable and quiet, and that we come together in Peace and good Order, and parted in the same, and no Person hath been harmed by such our Meetings; enquire of the Neighbourhood, and they will tell you, they believe in their Con∣sciences, our Meetings are for Good, and have good Effects, and are not evil, nor bring forth any Evil to any.</P>
<P>And as for the Manner of our meeting and sitting together, it is orderly and decently, and of good Report among Men; and for any Doctrine that ever was there held, or heard by any, none can truly accuse it to be either Error, or Heresy, or Sedition; but on the contrary, they know it witnesseth against all Sin and Iniquity, and tends to the turning of People from Ungodliness and Unrighteous∣ness, to Truth and Holiness: And many can tell, this is effected, by our Doctrine, preached in our Meetings; and our Neighbours can witness, that we part again in Peace and good Order, and in con∣venient Time; and they can shew you, they are not terrified, nor the Peace of the Land disturbed (on our Part) by our Meetings, which are in God's Fear, and to the Glory of his Name, which all Sober Men know, are according to the Law of God, and Gospel, and primitive Christian Example.</P>
<P>We are accused as heinous Offenders, and imprisoned, because 'tis supposed, <HI>We do not submit to obey the known Laws of the Land, but break them, and will not conform to the Church, pay Tithes, take Oaths, have Meet∣ings together,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>tho' we know the Laws of the Land command those Things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="003104_0331_0FEFF60D94D47948"/><HI>Plea,</HI> First, As to submitting to all known Laws of the Land; this is known to God and our Neighbours, that our Principle and Prac∣tice is, and ever hath been, to submit to every Government, and to submit to all Laws of Men, either by doing or by suffering, as at this Day, we resist not the greatest of Afflictions and Tribulations that can be imposed on us; and this is well known to our Neighbours and all People, that we are submissive to all Laws of Men, by patient suffering without Resistance; even when any Law requires any Thing of us which we cannot perform for Conscience-sake, that Law we fulfil by patient Suffering, resisting no Man, nor rendring Evil for Evil to any. And the Judgment of the Scriptures which are ac∣cording to both Law and Gospel, and the Precedents of Saints justify us in this Case, in chusing patiently to suffer the greatest Penalties of the Law, rather than to obey (by doing) any such Law as requires things contrary to our pure Consciences; as in the Exam∣ple of the three Children, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3. who were commanded, <HI>To fall down and worship the golden Image, at what Time soever they heard the Sound of the Musick, upon the Penalty of being cast into the midst of the burn∣ing fiery Furnace:</HI> which Commandment they could not obey, nor could they fall down to worship the Image; but rather chused to suf∣fer the Penalty of being cast into the midst of the burning fiery Fur∣nace, which accordingly was done unto them. Again, in the Case of <HI>Daniel,</HI> chap. 6. who was commanded, <HI>To make no Petition to any God or Man for thirty Days, save to King</HI> Darius, <HI>upon the Penalty and Affliction of being cast into the Lyon's Den:</HI> But <HI>Daniel</HI> did rather chuse to suffer the Penalty, to be cast into the Den of Lyons, than to obey the Command∣ment; and was cast into the Lion's Den. By these Examples of holy Men, with many more that might be given out of the Scriptures, 'tis evi∣dent, <HI>That righteous Men will rather chuse to suffer, than to obey any Law of Man contrary to their Consciences.</HI> So the Law of God, and Exam∣ple of Saints, and holy Scriptures give Judgment for us in this Case, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather chusing to suffer, than to obey Laws contrary to our Con∣sciences; and consequently must needs condemn such that persecute and imprison us, because they require Obedience of us in Things against our Consciences.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho' we disobey Laws, and cannot actively obey every Law of Man, when it requireth and commandeth Things contrary to a good Conscience, yet herein also are we justified, by the Law of God, Example of Saints, and holy Scriptures, and they give Judgment for us, and consequently against our Enemies in this Case; and in par∣ticular in the two Examples before-mentioned in <HI>Daniel,</HI> the three Children were expresly commanded, <HI>to fall down and worship the golden Image;</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> was also required by the King's Decree, <HI>Not to pray to any God or Man, save to King</HI> Darius; yet all these holy Men of God did absolutely disobey the Law and Decree so requiring of them, and did contrary to the Commandment; for the three Children did not bow, nor <HI>Daniel</HI> cease to pray to God, but prayed as at other Times, and yet were justified of God in so doing. Also, the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ (<HI>Acts</HI> 4.18.) were commanded, <HI>to preach no more in the Name of Jesus;</HI> but the Apostles did disobey their Com∣mandment, and went on and preached in the Spirit and Power of Christ, contrary to the Commandment of the Rulers, and appealed to them, <HI>Whether it were not bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to obey God than Man?</HI> Many Exam∣ples we might collect out of the Scriptures, that the Servants of God did disobey the Commands of Kings and Rulers, and could not obey (by doing) any Command contrary to God; but rather choosed to suffer Afflictions, and Death it self, than to obey such Laws and Decrees,
<PB N="321" REF="003104_0332_0FEFF64B0809ADA0"/>
as required any Thing contrary to a pure Conscience: And this is our Case at this Day; we cannot obey (by doing) any Thing against our Consciences, but must break the Laws of Men, and disobey their Commandments, rather than break the Law of God, and sin against our own Consciences, whatsoever we suffer because hereof; and yet the Examples of Saints and Scriptures justify us in this Behalf.</P>
<P>And let all our Enemies cease to cry out, <HI>Rebellious and disobedient to Laws and Government;</HI> for we are not such as do wilfully and obsti∣nately disobey any Laws of Men, but for Conscience-sake, and that we may not sin against God, nor offend his Witness in us; therefore we cannot obey Laws contrary to our Consciences, whatsoever we suf∣fer, which we resist not, nor rebel against any in this Case: So that our Principles and Practices are to obey every Law and Government, ei∣ther by doing, or suffering. And tho' we disobey such Laws as are not according to the Law of God, and rather do chuse to suffer, yet herein we are justified by the Law of God, and the holy Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> And as for our Conversations among Men, in Respect of our daily Walking and Converse with them in our Dealing, in Respect of Honesty, and Faithfulness, and Truth, and Justness in Works and Words, our Neighbours shall give, Witness for us: We will not justify our selves, 'tis God that justifies us, and the Law of God, Gospel of Christ, Scriptures, Examples of holy Men, our Neighbours, and the Witness of God in all Mens Consciences, shall bear Witness to us; and all these do give Judgment for us in these Cases, to whom we do appeal for Judgment. And, <HI>O Lord God everlasting, do thou judge our Cause; do thou make it manifest in thy due Season to all the World, that we are thy People, that we love thee above all, that we fear thy Name more than all, that we love Righteousness, and hate Iniquity, and that we now suffer for thy holy Name and Truth, and for thy Honour and Justice, and for thy Truth and Holiness: O Lord, thou knowest we are resolved to perish, rather than to lose one Grain hereof.</HI> Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Our Accusations and Answers truly compared, and weighed in the Balance of Justice and Truth in every Man's Conscience, let all the World judge of the Case: Do we deserve to be ruin'd, destroy'd, im∣prison'd, and banish'd, and that to be devour'd of wild Beasts, as our Enemy threatens us he will do? Is it so? Are we Hereticks? Are we seditious? Are we Drunkards? Are we Double-dealers? Are we such as the Law of God condemns? What Evil have we done in the Land? Do we hurt any Body? Are we not innocent before the Lord and Men? We appeal to the just Witness of God and Men, let it be answered; and tho' no Man will hear and consider our Cause this Day, yet the Lord will plead our Cause in his Time and Season, and make the World to know, <HI>We are his People;</HI> in the mean Time we are willing to suffer the Reproaches of ungodly Men, till the Lord works Deli∣verance in the Earth.</P>
<P>But now it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> objected by the Magistrates and Rulers, <HI>That we have now a Law against you, and you must suffer, for we cannot but put the Law in Execution, according to our Oaths and Offices; and it is not we that persecute you, but it is the Law of the Land by which you now suffer; and we cannot be blamed for your Suffering, we only execute the Law.</HI> And after this Manner is the Reasoning of some at this Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> To all which I do answer: It is true, there is a Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enacted against us, which is pretendedly made the Ground of our Suf∣fering; but whether that Law be in it self just, or unjust, I shall not now demonstrate, but shall leave it to the Judgment of all Christian Men that know us, our Principles, Doctrines, Ways, and Conversa∣tions, and let them judge whether we deserve the Penalties and Pu∣nishments,
<PB N="322" REF="003104_0333_0FEFF60FEE23C868"/>
therein describ'd, for any Principle or Practice hold or main∣tained by us. And tho' there be a Law against us, yet the Magistrates that are Executors thereof, may execute the same with Moderation or with Violence, with Discretion or too much Rigour; and it will be well for them to use Moderation and Discretion in this Case: Hereby may they save themselves from that Weight of Anger and Indignation of the Lord God, that will come upon all violent Doers, who seek to destroy the Innocent, and rejoice in the Occasion administred.</P>
<P>And tho' this Law be enacted against Meetings, not ours, I may say; but such Meetings as are dangerous to the publick Peace, and to the Terror of the People: But our Meetings are not such, and there∣fore this Law may not justly extend in its Execution to the Breaking of our Meetings, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to banish us because of our meeting together, which is for the Worship of God, and are peaceable and of good Report among all good Men; and are not for Disturbance of the Peace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Terror of the People, and therefore justly free from this Law, as afore∣said.</P>
<P>And tho' this Law is pretended against us, for to banish us, and to rid the Land of us, as some vainly suppose; yet, must it needs be executed to the Height of it without Limitation or Restriction? Must this Law be executed to its Height more than some other Laws, that are as truly enacted, and as fully in Force as this Act can be? Yet some such Laws there are, which better deserve Execution than this, yet they lie <HI>dormant,</HI> as is visibly apparent at this Day, as in 4 <HI>Jac.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.5. in these Words: <HI>Be it enacted,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That all, and every Person or Persons, which after forty Days next following the End of this present Session of Parliament, shall be drunk, and of the same Offence of Drunkenness shall be lawfully convicted, shall for every such Offence forfeit and lose five shilings,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to be paid to the Hands of the Churchwardens of that Parish where the Offence shall be committed, who shall be accountable therefore to the Ʋse of the Poor of the same Parish. And if the said Person or Persons so convicted, shall refuse or neglect to pay the said Forfeiture, then the same shall be levied of the Goods of every such Person or Persons, by Warrant of Precept from the Court, Judge, or Justices, before whom the same Conviction shall be: And if the Offender be not able to pay the Sum of five Shillings, then he shall be committed to the Stocks for the Space of six Hours.</HI> I pray you read the <HI>Statute at large,</HI> 'tis worth a sober Man's Pains to read over, and then judge whether that Law be duly executed at this Day; and also, whether it deserves not more strict Execution than the present Act against us. Also the 1 <HI>Jac. cap.</HI> 7. in these Words; <HI>That all Persons calling themselves Scho∣lars, going about begging; all idle Persons going about in any Country, either begging, or using any subtil Craft, or unlawful Games or Plays, or feigning themselves to have Knowledge in Physiognomy, or pretending that they can tell Fortunes, or such other like phantastical Imaginations; all Fencers, Rear∣wards, Common Players of Interludes and Minstrels, wandering abroad, shall be taken, adjudged and deemed as Rogues, Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars, and shall suffer such Pains and Punishments as are expressed,</HI> 39 Eliz. cap. 4. (viz.) <HI>That every such Person shall be stripped naked from the Middle up∣wards, and shall be only whipped until his or her Body be bloody,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and shall be forthwith sent from Parish to Parish,</HI> &amp;c. And read the Statute at large, and then consider how duly it is executed now, and whether it deserves not the Execution as much as the late Act against us, tho' in some Places the one is more executed than the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her; where many of our Friends being honest sober Persons, and of good Conversation, and yet are haled out of their Meetings, where they are met only to worship God, and for no other End, and sent to Prison, and persecuted to the very Height of the said Act; whenas idle Persons, following

unlawful Games, and Plays, and Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wards, Common Players of Inter∣ludes and Ministrels of divers Kinds, do wander up and down City and Country, and having their Playhouses publick, where their Wicked∣ness is acted; such Persons, and such Things, tho' appearing publick∣ly, yet are permitted, and little or no Notice taken of them by some of the Magistrates, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o as to punish them for Breach of the Laws, for the preventing of these Evils: But such Wickedness is too much suf∣fered, tho there be divers Acts of Parliament against such Persons and such Actions, as well as there is one against our Meetings; yet the Act against us is more put in Execution in some Places for the breaking of our Meetings, which are for the Worship of God, than the good Laws for suppressing Wickedness, tho' there is better Law for the one than for the other. Divers other Laws and Statutes made for good Ends, for the suppressing of Wickedness in the Land, there are, which are but easily executed at this Day: But here is one Act against peaceable meeting together for the Worship of God, which is violently prosecuted and executed upon innocent Men; and let all just Man judge of these Things: Tho' there be a Law enacted against our Meetings, so there is against Drunkards and Drunkenness, and unsea∣sonable Tippling in Taverns and Alehouses; and against Minstrels Fidlers, Pipers and Players, Common Players and Stage-Players, that go up and down the Countries, and have their Play-houses in publick Cities; which Statutes ought rather to be executed, tho' they are not: But these Things we shall leave to all sober People to judge of.</P>
<P>And seeing that the Law against us is more put in Execution, than these other Laws, it doth appear, That there is more Envy against us, and our peaceable religious Meetings, than there is against Prophane∣ness and Wickedness, Drunkenness and Stage-playing, and such like; and such Magistrates, wheresoever they are, are not excusable in the Sight of God, tho' there is a Law against us, while they prosecute it against us, and not these other good Laws against prophane and un∣godly Persons and Practices: And therefore seeing we do suffer, we must say, <HI>It is not only because there is a Law against us;</HI> but it is also, or rather, <HI>Because there is Enmity, and Wrath, and Wickedness in the Hearts of Men against us,</HI> which is the main Cause of our Sufferings at this Day.</P></Q>
<P>Thus was <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> always laborious; and like a faithful and di∣ligent Minister of Christ, he was so totally devoted to the Service of God and the Church, both in preaching, and writing in the Defence of the Gospel, that he scarce reserved any Time for himself, and sel∣dom took Rest, but continued to work incessantly till the Time of his Departure drew near; plainly manifesting, that it really was his Meat and Drink to do the Will of his heavenly Father; and this he endea∣voured unweariedly to the End of his Days.</P>
<P>Now I turn again to <HI>New-England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> Persecu∣tion continu'd.</NOTE> where, tho' the murdering Part was acted to the full, yet their Blood-thirstiness was not quenched; as may appear from the following Relation I shall give of the cruel Whip∣pings inflicted on some. If I should relate all of that Kind that hap∣pened there, it would make up a pretty big Volume by it self; and therefore I'll mention some few Instances only.</P>
<P>Among these I meet with <HI>Josiah Southick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhuman Cruelties ex∣ercised on <HI>Jo∣siah Southick.</HI></NOTE> (whose Father and Mother, <HI>Laurence</HI> and <HI>Cassandra,</HI> had been of the first that were banished from <HI>Boston</HI> because of their Religion, as hath been said before; and whose Brother and Sister had been order'd to be sold for Bond-slaves,) who ha∣ving been in <HI>Old England,</HI> and had found himself obliged, notwithstand∣ing the severe Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Sentence and Speech thereupon.</NOTE> to return to <HI>Boston,</HI> was sentenced to be whipt at a Cart's Tail, first at <HI>Boston,</HI> and then at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> and <HI>Dedham,</HI> when

with out-stretch'd Arms he said to those who sentenced him; <HI>Here's my Body; if ye want a farther Testimony of the Truth I profess, take it, and tear it to Pieces; it is freely given up; and for your Sentence, I matter it not:</HI> Ad∣ding further, <HI>It is no more terrifying unto me than if ye had taken a Feather and blown it up in the Air, and had said, Take heed it hurt thee not. For surely Tongue cannot express nor declare the Goodness and Love of God to his suffering People.</HI> Then he was stript and ty'd to the Cart's Tail in <HI>Boston,</HI> where the Hangman scourged him with what Vehemency he could. It is remar∣kable that the Whip, used for these cruel Executions, was not of Whip∣cord, as those in <HI>England,</HI> but of dry'd Guts; and every String with three Knots at the End; which being fastned to a Stick, the Hang∣man many Times laid on with both his Hands, which must cause violent Torture to the Body. But all this Cruelty was not able to make <HI>Josiah</HI> faint; for as he was led thro' the Streets of <HI>Boston</HI> at the Cart's Tail, he sung aloud, and was heard to utter these Words; <HI>They that know God to be their Strength, cannot fear what Man can do.</HI> The same Day he was whipt also at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> and the next Morning, it being very cold, at <HI>Dedham,</HI> where he was discharg'd, and turn'd in∣to the Wilderness.

<P>Cruel indeed was this Order; because to whip these three tender Women thro' eleven Towns, with Ten Stripes a-piece at each Place, thro' a length of near eighty Miles, in bitter cold Weather, would have been enough to have beaten their Bones bare, and their Lives out of their Bodies.</P>
<P>Now in a very cold Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sentence executed at <HI>Dover,</HI> the Priest looking on and laugh∣ing.</NOTE> the Deputy <HI>Walden at Dover,</HI> caused these Women to be stripp'd naked from the Middle upward, and tied to a Cart, and then whipt them, while the Priest look'd on and laugh'd at it; which some of their Friends seeing, and taking Notice of <HI>Walden</HI>'s Cruelty, testified against; for which <HI>Walden</HI> put two of them in the Stocks.</P>
<P>The Women being thus whipt at <HI>Dover,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are car∣ried to <HI>Hamp∣ton.</HI></NOTE> were carried to <HI>Hampton,</HI> and there delivered to the Constable, <HI>William Fifield,</HI> who having under∣stood from the Constable of <HI>Dover</HI> what Work he had in bringing them thro' a deep Road, thought to have daunted them, and said, <HI>I profess,
<PB N="325" REF="003104_0336_0FEFF6514A0FF550"/>
you must not think to make Fools of Men.</HI> To which they answered, <HI>They should be able to deal with him as well as the other.</HI> This Constable the next Morning would have whipt them before Day; but they refused, saying, <HI>That they were not ashamed of their Sufferings.</HI> Then he would have whipt them on their Clothes, when he had them at the Cart. But they said, <HI>Set us free, or do according to thy Order;</HI> which was, <HI>to whip them on their naked Backs.</HI> He then spoke to a Woman to take off their Clothes; but she said, <HI>She would not do it for all the World. Why,</HI> said he, <HI>I profess I'll do it my self.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And there whipp'd.</NOTE> So he stript them, and then stood trembling with the Whip in his Hand, and so he did the Execution, tho' at first he profess'd himself so stout.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> &amp; again whipt.</NOTE> Then he carried them to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> thro' Dirt and Snow, half the Leg deep; and here they were whipt again. Among the rest of the Spectators, <HI>Edward Wharton,</HI> accidentally passing along that Way, came to be one; and beholding this Whipping, one <HI>Thomas Broadberry,</HI> Clerk of the Courts at <HI>Salisbury</HI> and <HI>Hampton,</HI> said to him, <HI>Edward Wharton, What do you here? I am here,</HI> answered he, <HI>to see your Wickedness and Cruelty, that so if ye kill these Women, I may be able to de∣clare how ye murder'd them:</HI> For indeed their Bodies were so torn, that if Providence had not watched over them, they might have been in Danger of their Lives.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Barefoot</HI> obtaining the Warrant, lets them go, Priest <HI>Wheel∣wright</HI> advi∣sing the con∣trary.</NOTE> But it fell out so, that they were discharged: For the Constable at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who must have carried them to <HI>New∣berry,</HI> was desired by one <HI>Walter Barefoot,</HI> to make him his Deputy; who thus receiving the Warrant, set them at Liberty; tho' <HI>John Wheelwright,</HI> the Priest, advised the Constable to drive on, as his safest Way.</P>
<P>These three Women being thus unexpectedly released, went to <HI>New Quechawanah,</HI> where they had a Meeting, and <HI>Shubal Drummer</HI> the Priest of the Place, came also thither, and sat quiet. And the Meeting being ended, he stood up, and said, <HI>Good Women, ye have spoken well, and pray∣ed well; pray what is your Rule?</HI> They answering, <HI>The Spirit of God is our Rule, and it ought to be thine and all Mens to walk by.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest <HI>Drum∣mer</HI>'s rash Ex∣pression.</NOTE> He replied, <HI>It is not my Rule, nor I hope ever shall be.</HI> A clear Evidence how Prejudice may biass even discreet People; for being prepossessed thereby, Men will speak sometimes rashly, without considering what.</P>
<P>Not long after, these Women returned to <HI>Dover,</HI> to visit their Friends; and being in a Meeting the next First-day of the Week, the Constables, <HI>Thomas Roberts,</HI> and his Brother <HI>John,</HI> rushed in, and laid Hands on <HI>Alice Ambrose</HI> as she was in Prayer, and taking her, one by the one Arm, and the other by the other, they dragg'd her out of Doors, almost a Mile, with her Face towards the Snow, which was near Knee deep, over Stumps and old Trees, having put on their old Clothes, on purpose not to dirty their better Suits.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are a∣gain seized at <HI>Dover,</HI> and dragg'd about in a barbarous Manner.</NOTE> Then they lock'd her up in a certain House, and so went back to fetch <HI>Mary Tomkins,</HI> whom they dragg'd in the same Manner; which their Father, old <HI>Thomas Roberts</HI> seeing, lamented, and cry'd, <HI>Wo that ever I was Father to such wicked Children.</HI> But they seem'd not to matter what their Father said, who had been a Member of the Church at <HI>Dover</HI> above twenty Years; but because he no longer frequented their Worship for their Degeneracy, they took away his Cow, which, with its Milk, helpt to support him and his Wife. <HI>Mary Tomkins</HI> being brought into the House where <HI>Alice</HI> was, <HI>Anne Coleman,</HI> was also fetch'd. Next Morning they got a Canoe, and threatned the Women, <HI>They would now do with them, that they should be troubled with them no more;</HI> by which Saying, they seem'd to signify, that they would give them up to the Mercy of the Sea; which made the Women unwilling to go to the Water-side. Then one <HI>Edward Weymouth</HI> took <HI>Mary</HI> by the Arms, and dragg'd her on her Back over the Stumps of Trees, down a very steep Hill; by which she was much bruised, and often dyed away.
<PB N="326" REF="003104_0337_0FEFF6146476EE30"/>
They also laid hold on <HI>Alice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At the Insti∣gation of <HI>Hate-evil Nutwel</HI> a ru∣ling Elder.</NOTE> whom they pluck'd violently into the Wa∣ter, and kept her swimming by the Canoe, so that she was in Danger of being drowned, or frozen to Death. <HI>Anne Coleman</HI> was likewise rudely dealt with, and all this in the Presence of one <HI>Hate-evil Nutwel,</HI> a ruling Elder, who stirr'd up the Constables to this wicked Action, and so shew'd that he bore a wrong Name. But the wicked Intention of these Men was stopt by a Power from on high, for on a sudden a great Tempest arose, so that they brought the Women back again to the House, and about Midnight they turn'd them all out of Doors in the Snow, the Weather being so frosty, that <HI>Alice</HI>'s Clothes were frozen like Boards. How bar∣barously soever these Women were treated, yet the Lord was pleased to preserve and support them.</P>
<P>Afterwards it happened that <HI>Anne Coleman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anne Cole∣man</HI> and o∣thers again <HI>whipp'd.</HI></NOTE> and four of her Friends were whipp'd thro' <HI>Salem, Boston,</HI> and <HI>Dedham,</HI> by Order of <HI>William Hawthorn,</HI> who before he was a Magistrate, had opposed Compulsion for Conscience; and when under the Government of <HI>Cromwel</HI> it was propo∣sed to make a Law, That none should preach without License, he pub∣lickly said at <HI>Salem, That if ever such a Law took Place in</HI> New-England, <HI>he should look upon it as one of the most abominable Actions that were ever committed there, and that it would be as eminent a Token of God</HI>'s <HI>having for∣saken</HI> New-England, <HI>as any could be:</HI> And yet afterward this Man beca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a fierce Persecutor of those who asserted Liberty of Preaching; the formerly it may be, if any one had foretold him how he would be given to Persecution, he would have said as <HI>Hazael</HI> to the Prophet <HI>Elisha, What, is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do this great Thing?</HI> But to return to <HI>Anne Coleman,</HI> when she was to be whipt at <HI>Dedham,</HI> and fastned to the Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Deputy <HI>Bellingham</HI> having seen <HI>Hawthorn</HI>'s Warrant, said, <HI>The War∣rant is firm,</HI> and then bad the Executioner go on; who thus encoura∣ged, laid on so severely, that with the Knot of the Whip, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Nipple of her Breast, which so totur'd her, that it almost o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her her Life; and she, who was a little weakly Woman, thinking this would have been her Lot, said once, that if she should happen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thus, she was willing that her Body should be laid before <HI>Bellingham</HI>'s Door, with a Charge from her Mouth, <HI>That he was guilty of her Blood.</HI></P>
<P>The Usage <HI>Elizabeth Hooton</HI> met with, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n't pass by in Silence, because of her Age, being about sixty, who hearing of the Wickedness committed by those of <HI>New-England,</HI> was moved to make a Voyage to <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>In Order thereto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Relation of the cruel U∣sage of <HI>Eliz. Hooton,</HI> and <HI>J. Broksup.</HI></NOTE> she went from <HI>England</HI> in the Year 1661, having one <HI>Joan Broksup</HI> with her, a Woman near as aged as her self, who freely resolved to be her Companion: And because they could not find a Master of a Ship that was willing to carry them to <HI>New England,</HI> because of the Fine for every <HI>Quaker</HI> that was brought thither, they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t sail towards <HI>Virginia,</HI> where they met with a Ketch which carried them Part of the Way, and then they went the rest by Land, and so at length came to <HI>Boston.</HI> But there they could not soon find a Place of Reception, because of the Penalty on those that received a <HI>Quaker</HI> into their Houses. Yet at length a Woman received them. Next Day they went to the Prison to visit their Friends; but the Jailor altogether unwilling to let them in, carried them to the Governor <HI>Endicot,</HI> who with much scurri∣lous Language, called them <HI>Witches,</HI> and asked <HI>Elizabeth, What she came for?</HI> To which she answer'd, <HI>To do the Will of him that sent me.</HI> And he demanding, <HI>What was that?</HI> She replied, <HI>To warm thee of shedding any more innocent Blood.</HI> To which he returned, <HI>That he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng more yet.</HI> But she told him, <HI>He was in the Hand of the Lord, who could take him away first.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which was fulfilled, for after that, he never took away the Lives of any more of those called <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> This so displeased him, that he sent them to Prison, where
<PB N="327" REF="003104_0338_0FEFF65380ADEB70"/>
many more of their Friends were. After Consultation what to do with them, they were carried two Days Journey into the Wilderness, among Wolves and Bears: But by Providence they got to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> where they took Ship for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are im∣prison'd, and after carried into the Wil∣derness among the Beasts of Prey.</NOTE> and from thence to <HI>New-England</HI> again, and so returned to <HI>Boston.</HI> But then they were put into a Ship which carried them to <HI>Virginia,</HI> from whence <HI>Elizabeth</HI> departed to <HI>Old Eng∣land,</HI> where she staid some Time in her own Habitation.</P>
<P>But it came upon her to visit <HI>New-England</HI> again; and so she did, taking her Daughter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> along with her. And being arriv'd, those of the Magistrates that were present, would have fined the Master of the Ship an Hundred Pounds for bringing her over contrary to their Law. But he telling them, That <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had been with the King, and that she had Liberty from him to come thither to buy her a House, this so puzzled these snarling Persecutors, that they found themselves at a Loss, and thus were stopt from seizing the Master's Goods.</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth</HI> being come to <HI>Boston,</HI> notwithstanding the Rulers, went to them, and signified that she came thither <HI>to buy a House for her self to live in.</HI> She was four Times at the Court for that Purpose, but it was denied her: And tho' she said, <HI>That this Denial would give her Occasion, if she went to</HI> England <HI>again, to lay it before the King,</HI> it was in vain, and had no Influence upon them.</P>
<P>Departing then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Cam∣bridge, Eli∣zabeth</HI> is kept two Days in a Dungeon, without Food.</NOTE> and passing thro' several Places, she came to <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> and was thrust into a stinking Dungeon, where there was nothing to lie down or sit on. Here they kept her two Days and two Nights, without affording her any Thing to eat or drink; and because a certain Man in Compassion brought her a little Milk, he was also cast into Pri∣son, and fined five Pounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is ordered to be whipp'd at 3 Towns. Which is done accordingly.</NOTE> Being brought to the Court, they order'd her to be sent out of their Coasts, and to be whipt at three Towns, ten Stripes at each. So at <HI>Cambridge</HI> she was tied to the Whipping-past, and lash'd with ten Stripes, with a three-string'd Whip, with three Knots at an End: At <HI>Water-Town</HI> she had ten Stripes more with Willow Rods; and to make up all, at <HI>Dedham,</HI> in a cold frosty Morning, she received ten cruel Lashes at a Cart's Tail. And being thus beaten and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Then left a Prey to the savage Beasts in the Wilder∣ness.</NOTE> she was put on Horse-back, and carried many Miles into the Wilder∣ness; and towards Night they left her there, where were many Wolves, Bears, and other wild Beasts, and many deep Waters to pass thro': But being preserved by an invisble Hand, she came in the Morning into a Town call'd <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oboth,</HI> being neither weary nor faint; and from thence she went to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> where coming to her Friends, she gave Thanks to God, for having counted her worthy, and enabled her to suffer for his Name's-sake, beyond what her Age and Sex, morally speaking, could otherwise have born.</P>
<P>After some Stay there, she returned to <HI>Cambridge</HI> about eighty Miles to fetch her Linnen and Clothes, which the inhumane Persecutors would not suffer her to take with her after they had whipt her. Ha∣ving fetch'd these Things, and going back with her Daughter and <HI>Sa∣rah Coleman</HI> an ancient Woman, she was taken up by the Constable of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and carried Prisoner to <HI>Cambridge;</HI> where being ask'd by one of the Magistrates whose Name was <HI>Daniel Gookin, Wherefore she came thither, seeing they had warned her not to come there any more:</HI> She answered, <HI>That she came not there of her own Accord, but was forced thither, after she had been to fetch her Clothes, which they would not let her take with her when she was whipt, and sent away; but that now returning back, she was taken up by Force out of the Highway, and carried thither.</HI> Then the other old Woman was asked, <HI>Whether she owned</HI> Elizabeth <HI>and her Religion?</HI> To which she answered, <HI>She owned the Truth.</HI> And of <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Daughter he demand∣ed, <HI>Dost thou own thy Mother's Religion?</HI> To which she was silent. And
<PB N="328" REF="003104_0339_0FEFF61770A9B7C8"/>
yet they were sent to the House of Correction, with Order to be whipt. Next Morning the Executioner came betimes before it was Light, and asked them, <HI>Whether they would be whipt there?</HI> Which made <HI>Elizabeth</HI> ask, <HI>Whether he was come to take away their Blood in the Dark? and whether they were ashamed that their Deeds should be seen?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">She with her Daughter and another Woman again whipt.</NOTE> But not heeding what she said, he took her down Stairs, and whipt her with a three string'd Whip. Then he brought down the ancient Woman, and did the like to her. And taking <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Daughter, he gave the like to her also, who never was there before, nor had said or done any Thing. After this, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the Mother was whipt again at a Cart's Tail at <HI>Boston,</HI> and other Places, where she came to see her Friends; since which I have several Times seen her in <HI>England</HI> in a good Condition.</P>
<P>I could relate many more Severities of the <HI>New-England</HI> Persecutors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Severi∣ties omitted.</NOTE> but I long to come to an End, and therefore shall make a large Step, and outrun some Space of Time.</P>
<P>In the Year 1664,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel Treat∣ment of <HI>M.

Being af∣terwards arrived at <HI>Boston, Mary</HI> grew so sick, that she was thought to be near Death; which made <HI>Edward Wharton</HI> with <HI>Wenlock Christison</HI> come from <HI>Saelm,</HI> to visit her. But after they had been there a little Time, in came two Constables, and notwithstanding <HI>Mary</HI>'s weak Condition, forc'd them all to the Governor's House. Now tho' <HI>Mary</HI> seemed to be a little on the mending Hand, yet she was so ill, that she fell down as it were dead in the Way. But one of the Constables staid with her till she came to her self again, and then brought her before the Governor, where was also Deputy <HI>Bellingham</HI> and <HI>Thomas Daufort,</HI> one of the Ma∣gistrates; who ordered all four of them to be whipt; but because <HI>Mary</HI> was so weak, and lest probably she might die under their Hands, they gave Order that she and <HI>Alice</HI> should not be whipt at <HI>Boston,</HI> but at the Towns beyond.

<P>But no Exhortation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A warning by a Girl of about 14 Years of Age.</NOTE> how extraordinary soever, seemed to take any Hold on these Persecutors: For once a Girl of thirteen or fourteen Years of Age, called <HI>Hannah Wright,</HI> whose Sister had been banished for Religion, was stirred with such Zeal, that coming from <HI>Long-Island,</HI> some Hundreds of Miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> into that Bloody Town, she ap∣peared in the Court there, and warned t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Magistrates, <HI>To spill no more innocent Blood,</HI> this Saying so struck them at first, that they all sate silent, till <HI>Rawson</HI> the Secretary said, <HI>What shall we be baffled by such a one as this!

<P>Here we see the Religion of these Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits of Un∣faithfulness.</NOTE> who once were so precise, that they would not join with the Worship of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> But it seems not improbable that they fell away to this Hardness of Heart, because being convinced in their Understandings of some super∣stitious Ceremonies that were yet remaining in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> they were not faithful to testify against those Things, and to set their Light on the Candlestick; but that to shun the Cross, and avoid Suf∣ferings, they chose to go into a strange Country. And yet they were so presumptuous as to say, They were the purest Church on Earth, and their Magistrates and Preachers were very godly Men. And it may be, some of their cruel Executioners, seeing how their Magistrates (as hath been said of <HI>Thomas Daufort)</HI> did glory in Cruelty, have been foolish enough to perswade themselves, that their excessive Whipping was some kind of meritorious Work. But whatever these <HI>English</HI> People thought, they were worse than others. For in some Places of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> lived also <HI>Swedes,</HI> who in regard of their Worship were no less de∣spised by the <HI>English,</HI> than of old the <HI>Samaritans</HI> by the <HI>Jews:</HI> And yet these <HI>Swedes</HI> entertained the <HI>Quakers,</HI> when they came amongst them, far better than the <HI>English</HI> did; and thus they made it appear that they surpassed them in Life, if not in Profession. But the precise <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> Men seemed to place great Virtue in a sturdy Severity, of which the following is an Instance.</P>
<P>A <HI>Dutchman,</HI> an <HI>Ostender</HI> whose Name was <HI>John Laurence,</HI> was com∣mitted for Adultery, and brought before the Court at <HI>Boston,</HI> where the Governor <HI>John Endicot</HI> asked him, <HI>Whether he was guilty or not guilty?</HI> To which the Prisoner, who, as it seems spoke but bad <HI>English,</HI> said, <HI>No Guilt.</HI> On which <HI>Endicot</HI> said in a scoffing Manner, <HI>No Gelt; There's no Money:</HI> For <HI>Gheld</HI> signifies Money in <HI>Dutch.</HI> Thus the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s Words and Meaning were scoffingly perverted; and tho' there was no clear Evidence against him, yet he was condemned to be hang'd. But he denying the Fact, the Execution was deferred; and in the mean while the Priests <HI>John Wilson,</HI> and <HI>James Mayo</HI> came to him in Prison, to see what they could get out of him; and <HI>Mayo</HI> told him, <HI>His Time was near at an End, and that he must shortly die; and therefore he would have him now to confess.</HI> To which the Prisoner returned, <HI>What will you have me to confess, that which I never did?</HI> But <HI>Mayo</HI> did not desist, but said, <HI>Confess my Son, and give Glory to God.</HI> Yet the Prisoner continued in denying the Charge, and affirmed, he was <HI>clear.</HI> But said the Priest, <HI>You cannot be clear,</HI> for our Lord and Saviour saith, <HI>Whosoever looketh up∣on a fair Woman, and lus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth after her, he hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart.</HI> Truly a very perverse Use of the Scripture, for
<PB N="332" REF="003104_0343_0FEFF61C2B2DBDD0"/>
compassing a false End. But the <HI>Dutchman</HI> seeing how they came to betray him, was cautious; and at length after a long and tedious Im∣prisonment, found Means to break Prison, and thus escaped from those who grew accustomed to be merciless; so that sometimes others as well as <HI>Quakers,</HI> felt the Weight of their Severity.</P>
<P>As it happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Nicholson</HI> and her two Sons accused of Murder, and tho' No∣thing proved, she is fined, and they cru∣elly whipt.</NOTE> about the Time that <HI>William Leddra</HI> was put to Death, when one <HI>Elizabeth Nicholson</HI> and her two Sons <HI>Christopher</HI> and <HI>Joseph,</HI> were charged with the Death of her Husband and their Father <HI>Edmond Nicholson,</HI> who was found dead in the Sea. And Information being given that these People did sometimes shew Love to those they called <HI>cursed Quakers,</HI> they were all three fetch'd from their Habitation at <HI>Salem,</HI> and carried to <HI>Boston,</HI> and were tried for their Lives, meerly on Suspicion; but nothing of Murder was proved against them; yet the Mother was fined a great Sum, and her two Sons were sentenced to stand under the Gallows certain Hours, with Ropes about their Necks, and to be whipt in the Market-place, which was performed accordingly. And because these young Men were not daunted, Priest <HI>Wilson</HI> standing by, said, <HI>Ah cursed Generation.</HI> And at <HI>Salem</HI> they were whipt also, which was done so mercilesly, that one of the young Men sunk down, or died away under the Torture, tho' he was raised up, and came to Life again.</P>
<P>By this we may see how these <HI>New-England</HI> Persecutors were become inured to excessive Severity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deaths of some of <HI>New-England</HI> Per∣secutors.</NOTE> But before I leave them, I must also men∣tion the dreadful Exit of some of them.</P>
<P>The last Act of Governor <HI>Endicot</HI>'s bloody Part was the cruel Whip∣ping of <HI>Edward Wharton</HI> at <HI>Boston,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Governor <HI>Endicot.</HI></NOTE> related before: For the Time was now come that he must go off the Stage, to give an Account of his extravagant Severity before another Tribunal than that of his san∣guinary Court. The Measure ot his Iniquity was now filled up, and he was visited with a loathsome Disease, insomuch that he stunk alive, and so died with Rottenness, his Name being like to give a bad Sa∣vour thro' Ages to come.</P>
<P>Yet more remarkable was the Death of Major General <HI>Adderton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">General <HI>Ad∣derton.</HI></NOTE> who when <HI>Mary Dyar</HI> was hang'd, said scoffingly, and in an insulting Way, <HI>That she hung as a Flag, for others to take Example by;</HI> and who also, when <HI>Wenlock Christison</HI> being condemned to Death, warned the Persecutors because of the righteous Judgments of God, presumptuously said, <HI>You pronounce Woes and Judgments, and those that are gone before you, pronounced Woes and Judgments; but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon us as yet.</HI> But how he himself was struck by these Judg∣ments, and served for an Example to others, we are to see now.</P>
<P>He upon a certain Day having exercised his Soldiers, and riding proudly on his Horse towards his House, when he came about the Place where usually they loosed the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, from the Cart, after they had whipped them, a Cow came and crossed the Way, at which his Horse taking a Fright, threw him down so violently, that he died, his Eyes being started out of his Head, his Brains out of his Nose, his Tongue out of his Mouth, and his Blood out of his Ears. Thus God's Judgments came upon him suddenly, and at unawares.</P>
<P>And <HI>John Norton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Norton</HI> chief Priest.</NOTE> the Chief Priest of <HI>Boston,</HI> died likewise on a sud∣den. It was he who promoted the putting to Death of those Martyrs that died at <HI>Boston,</HI> as hath been related; and when he saw the Ma∣gistra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es paused upon the Execution of <HI>W. Robinson</HI> and <HI>M. Stevenson,</HI> he encouraged them thereto, especially because <HI>John Winthorp,</HI> Governor of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> earnestly dissuaded the shedding of innocent Blood. He it was also, who when <HI>William Brend</HI> was beaten so barbarously with a Rope, as hath been related in its due Place, did not stick to say, <HI>Since</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="003104_0344_0FEFF65A77FF9240"/>
<HI>Since</HI> William Brend <HI>endeavoured to beat their Gospel-Ordinances black and blue, it was but just upon him if he was beaten black and blue also.</HI> But this <HI>Norton</HI> was now struck with a Blow that made him sink: For having been at his Worship-house in the Forenoon, and intending to go in the Afternoon, as he was walking in his House, he fetch'd a great Groan, and leaning his Head against the Mantle-tree of the Chimney, he was heard to say, <HI>The Hand, or the Judgments of the Lord are upon me.</HI> These were his last Words, and he sunk down, and had fallen into the Fire, if he had not been caught by somebody that was present. More Ex∣amples of this Nature I could produce, but these may suffice.</P>
<P>What I have related ot these Cruelties, and much more, was pub∣lished in Print about that Time, that so the King and Parliament of <HI>England</HI> might know what happened there. For those Actions were done in publick View, and known there, all about the Country. All that they did, was to set a false Colour upon their Severity, and to dis∣guise Matters: And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was their Happiness, that they had not to do with revengeful People, else they might have been involved in great Streights: But the Friends of the Persecuted committed Vengeance to God, tho' some of the Great Ones in <HI>England</HI> advised them to sue the Persecutors, which according to Law they might have done.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Bellingham,</HI> a fierce Persecutor, and Governor, after <HI>John En∣dicot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Belling∣ham</HI> dies di∣stracted.</NOTE> went distracted ten Years after, and so died. Not long before, <HI>William Coddington,</HI> Governor of <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> writ a Letter to him, wherein he put him in Mind of the former Times; for he, (the said <HI>Coddington)</HI> had been one of the first Erectors of Colonies in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> and the first that built an House in <HI>Boston,</HI> and afterwards was a Magistrate seven Years; but when Persecution arose, he declared against it; and the Case was debated for three Days in the Court; but the mo∣derate Party was the weakest, and was opposed by all the Priests, ex∣cept one <HI>John Cotton,</HI> who said, he remembred, how at their Departure from <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Cotton</HI> the only Priest who opposes Persecution.</NOTE> he had preached on <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 11. and had shewed from that Text, <HI>That there was an inward Grace which was to be minded; and that therefore he would not give his Vote for persecuting the Assertors of that Doc∣trine:</HI> Shewing thereby much more Sense of Religion, than the other persecuting Priests. Now tho' <HI>Coddington</HI> was one of the greatest Mer∣chants, or Traders in that Country, and in all Probability might have acquired great Riches there; yet seeing his good Counsel was not heark∣ned to, he resolved to depart that Place, and go and live somewhere else. But whatever he said in his Letter to <HI>Bellingham,</HI> this Man re∣mained hardned, like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> having shewed himself cruel, even when <HI>Mary Fisher</HI> and <HI>Anne Austin</HI> first came to <HI>Boston,</HI> where he treated them in a barbarous Manner.</P>
<P>Yet one Thing remarkable I may mention here, which when I first: heard, I could not fully give Credit to; but thinking it worth the while to make a narrow Enquiry into it, I did so, not only by Writing, but also from the Mouths of Persons that had been Eye-witnesses, or had been informed by such; and from these I got this concurring Informa∣tion, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Country for many Miles about <HI>Boston</HI> will now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield no Wheat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> formerly very fertile.</NOTE> That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about <HI>Boston</HI> was formerly a very fruitful Soil, that produc'd excel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Wheat; but that since the Time this Town had been stained with the Blood of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, no Wheat, &amp;c. would grow to Perfection within many Miles, tho' the Ground had been plowed and sown several Times: For the very next Harvest, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Year 1660, after they had so barbarously and unchristian-like put the <HI>Quakers</HI> to Death, the Blast was sent upon their Wheat, so that it stank upon the Ground, and would never grow since, near <HI>Boston,</HI> to be worth the Seed, and Labour of plowing and sowing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that they were forc'd to be content with <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and such other Grain as would
<PB N="334" REF="003104_0345_0FEFF61E987C1100"/>
grow, after they had to little Purpose made many Tryals of plowing and sowing for Wheat in vain; being then forced to buy their Wheat <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>New-York, Long-Island, Maryland, Virginia,</HI> and afterwards from <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and the <HI>Jerseys.</HI> Now there having been so many re-iterated Instances of Unfruitfulness near the Town, ancient People who are still alive, and remember the first Times, generally agree in their Opinion, that this is a Judgment from Heaven, and a Curse on the Land, because of the shedding of innocent Blood at <HI>Boston.</HI> This Relation I had from so many credible Persons, (tho' the one knew nothing of the other, as differing much in Time) yet what they told me did so well agree in the main, that I could not but believe it, tho' I don't use to be credulous; and therefore I have been the more exact in my Enquiry, so that I can no longer question the Case; but it seems to me as a Punishment on that Blood-thirstiness which now hath ceased long ago.</P>
<P>In the Island of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> those called <HI>Quakers</HI> suffered also much by the People, instigated not a little by the Priests, <HI>Samuel Graves, Mat∣thew Gray, Thomas Manwaring,</HI> and <HI>Francis Smith;</HI> for these being often drunk,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T.

And <HI>Manwaring,</HI> who had threatned <HI>Clark,</HI> that he would procure a Law to be made, by which his Ears should be cut off, once wrote in a Letter to him, <HI>I am sorry that your Zeal surpasseth your Moderation, and that a Club must beat out of you what the Devil hath inspired.</HI> And this was because <HI>Clark</HI> had told him, that his Conversation was not becoming a Minister of the Gos∣pel.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS. The SEVENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now left <HI>America,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Severe Perse∣cution in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ver all the Kingdom. Of which a Relation is printed of 4200 that were impri∣soned.</NOTE> and being returned to <HI>England,</HI> let us go and see the State of Persecution at <HI>London,</HI> where desperate Fury now rag'd; tho' it was not in that chief Ci∣ty alone, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, were grievously persecuted: For a lit∣tle before this Time, there was published in Print a short Relation of the Persecution throughout all <HI>England,</HI> signed by twelve Persons, shew∣ing that more than four Thousand and two Hundred of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> both Men and Women, were in Prison in <HI>England,</HI> and deno∣ting the Number of them that were imprisoned in each County, either for frequenting Meetings, or for denying to swear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Many of these had been grievously beaten, or their Clothes torn, or taken away from them; and some were put into such stinking Dungeons, that some great Men said, they would not have put their hunting Dogs there. Some Prisons were crowded both full of Men and Women, so that there was not sufficient Room for all to sit down at once; and in <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire,</HI> sixty eight Persons were in this Manner lock'd up in a small Room; an evi∣dent Sign that they were a harmless People, that would not make any Resistance, or use Force.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many die in Jails.</NOTE> By such ill Treatment many grew sick, and not a few died in such Jails; for no Age or Sex was regarded, but even ancient People, of sixty, seventy, and more Years of Age, were not spared: And the most of these being Tradesmen, Shop-keepers, or Husbandmen, were thus reduced to Poverty; for their Goods were also seized, for not going to Church, so called, or for not paying Tythes. Many Times they were fain to lie in Prison, on cold nasty Ground, without being suffered to have any Straw; and often they have been kept several Days without Victuals: No Wonder therefore that many died by such hard Imprisonments as these.</P>
<P>At <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">About 500 imprisoned in <HI>London</HI> and Suburbs.</NOTE> and in the Suburbs, were about this Time no less than five Hundred of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> imprisoned, and some in such nar∣row Holes, that every Person scarcely had Conveniency to lie down; and the Felon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were suffered to rob them of their Clothes and Money. Many that were not imprisoned, nevertheless suffered Hardships in their religious Meetings, especially that in <HI>London,</HI> known by the Name of <HI>Bull and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meetings di∣sturb'd, and the Persons cruellybeaten.</NOTE> Here the train'd Bands came frequently, arm'd gene∣rally with Muskets, Pikes, and Halberts, and conducted by a milita∣ry Officer, by Order of the City Magistracy, and rushing in, in a very furious Manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to beating them, whereby many were grievously wounded, some fell down in a Swoon, and some were beaten so violent∣ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of which some died, and one <HI>J.

His Friends therefore thought it expedient to carry the Corps into the a∣foresaid Meeting-place, that it might lie there expos'd for some Hours,
<PB N="336" REF="003104_0347_0FEFF62051AF6B88"/>
to be seen of every one. This being done, raised Commiseration and Pity among many of the Inhabitants; for the Corps, beaten like a Jel∣ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coroner's Inquest sit on him.</NOTE> look'd black, and was swoln in a direful Manner. This gave Occa∣sion to send for the Coroner; and he being come, impanelled a Jury of the Neighbours, and gave them in Charge, according to his Office, to make true Enquiry upon their Oaths, and to present what they found to be the Cause of his Death. They viewing the Corps, had a Sur∣geon or two with them, to know their Judgment concerning it; and then going together in private, at length they withdrew, without giving in their Verdict, only desiring the Friends to bury the Corps, which was done accordingly that Evening. And tho' the Coroner and Jury met divers Times together upon that Occasion, and had many Consulta∣tions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But bring in no Verdict. A Letter to the Lord May∣or about it, and</NOTE> yet they never would give in a Verdict; but it appeared suffi∣ciently, that the Man was killed by violent Beating. The Reasons some gave for the Suspence of a Verdict, were, <HI>That tho' it was testified, that the same Person, now dead, was seen beaten, and knock'd down, yet it be∣ing done in such a confused Croud, no particular Man could be fix'd upon, so that any could say, that Man did the Deed. And if a Verdict was given, that the deceased Person was killed, and yet no particular Person charged with it, then the City was liable to a great Fine, at the Pleasure of the King, for conniving at such a Murder in the City, in the Day Time, not committed in a Corner, but in a publick Place, and not apprehending the Murderer, but suffering him to es∣scape.</HI> In the mean while, the Friends of the deceased were not wanting to give publick Notice of the Fact, and sent also a Letter to the Lord Mayor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Relation thereof print∣ed.</NOTE> which afterwards they gave out in Print, together with a Re∣lation of this bloody Business. In this Letter it was said,</P>
<P><HI>IT may be supposed thou hast heard of this Thing, for it was done not in the Night, but at the Mid Time of the Day; not suddenly, at unawares, or by Mishap, but intendedly, and in a long Space of Time a doing; and not in a Cor∣ner, but in the Streets of the City of</HI> London; <HI>all which Circumstances do highly aggravate this Murder, to the very Shame and Infamy of this famous City, and its Government.</HI></P>
<P>A certain Person who spread some of these printed Relations, was imprisoned for his Pains; nevertheless another brought one of them to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And brought to the King.</NOTE> and told him how the Thing had been done; at which the King said, <HI>I assure you it was not by my Advice that any of your Friends should be slain: Ye must tell the Magistrates of the City of it, and prosecute the Law a∣gainst them.</HI> This Saying of the King was not long after published in Print:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Disperser of it impriso∣ned by Alder∣man <HI>Brown.</HI></NOTE> But Violence prevailed still; for the Person that was apprehend∣ed for spreading the said Books, was sent to Prison by the special Or∣der of Alderman <HI>Brown,</HI> of whom since Mention may be made several Times in this Work, it gives me Occasion to say something of what kind of Man he was.</P>
<P>In the Time of <HI>Cromwel</HI> he had been very fierce against the Royalists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A short Cha∣racter of him.</NOTE> especially at <HI>Abingdon,</HI> not far from <HI>Oxford:</HI> For this Error he endea∣vour'd now to make Compensation, by violent persecuting of the harm∣less <HI>Quakers;</HI> otherwise he was a comely Man, and could commit Cru∣elty with a smiling Countenance. But more of his Actions may be represented hereafter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quakers</HI> be∣ing kept out of their Meet∣ing Houses, preach in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eets.</NOTE> so called, seeing that they could not obtain Justice, let the Matter of the murdered Person alone; for Suffering was now their Portion, and therefore they left their Cause to God. Oftentimes they were kept out of their Meeting-houses by the Soldiers; but then they did not use to go away, but stood before the Place, and so their Num∣ber soon encreased; and then one or other of their Ministers generally
<PB N="337" REF="003104_0348_0FEFF662E3615B98"/>
stept upon a Bench or some high Place, and so preached boldly. Thus he got sometimes more Hearers than otherwise he might have had. But such an one sometimes was soon pulled down, which then gave Occasion for another to stand up and preach, and thus often four or five one after another, were taken away as innocent Sheep, and carried to Prison with others of their Friends, it may be, forty or fifty at once. This puts me in Mind of what I heard my Mother, <HI>Judith Zinspenning</HI> say, who in the Year next following, being gone for <HI>England,</HI> with <HI>William Caton</HI> and his Wife, who liv'd at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> to visit her Friends there, and coming to <HI>London,</HI> went with others to the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Mouth</HI> Meeting; but Entrance being denied, they stay'd in the Street, where she saw one Preacher after another, pull'd down, at the Instant Cry of some Officer or other, <HI>Constable, take him away.</HI> Several being thus led away, the Constable came also to her, and perceiving by her Dress that she was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Woman, pull'd her by the Sleeve, and said with Admiration, <HI>What, a</HI> Dutch <HI>Quaker!</HI> but meddled no farther with her. This keeping of Meetings in the Streets became now a Customary Thing in <HI>England;</HI> for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, were persuaded that the Exer∣cise of their publick Worship was a Duty no Man could discharge them from,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accounting publick Wor∣ship an indis∣pensable Du∣ty.</NOTE> and they believed that God required the performing of this Ser∣vice from their Hands. And by thus meeting in the Streets, it hap∣pened sometimes that more than one, nay, it may be three or four at a Time, did preach, one in one Place, and another in another, which in their Meeting-places could not have been done conveniently. But thus they got abundance of Auditors, and among these sometimes emi∣nent Men, who passing by in their Coaches, made their Coachmen stop. At this Rate they found there was a great Harvest, and thus their Church increased under Sufferings; and in those sharp Times they were pretty well purified of Dross, since the Trial was too hot for such as were not sincere; for by frequenting their Meetings in such a Time, one was in Danger of being either imprisoned, or beaten lame, or unto Death: But this could not quench the Zeal of the Upright.</P>
<P>Now the taking away of one Preacher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As one Prea∣cher's taken away, another stands up; e∣ven Women, and some∣times Boys.</NOTE> and the standing up of ano∣ther, became an ordinary Thing in <HI>England,</HI> and it lasted yet long after, as I my self have been an Eye-witness of there. And when there were no more Men-preachers present, it may be, a Woman would rise, and minister to the Meeting; nay, there were such who in Years being little more than Boys, were endued with a manly Zeal, and encouraged their Friends to Stedfastness. In the mean while, many also were imprisoned, without being haled out of their Meetings; for some have been appre∣hended for speaking only something on the Behalf of their Friends, as <HI>Rebecca Travers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rebecca Travers</HI> im∣prisoned.</NOTE> who going to the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower,</HI> desired him to have Compassion on some who were imprisoned for frequenting of Meetings. But he grew angry at this; and when she went away, one of the Keepers gave her ill Language: On which, she exhorting him, <HI>to be good in his Place, whilst it was the Lord's Will he had it,</HI> he was so offend∣ed, that going back to the Lieutenant, he complained that she had spo∣ken Treason, and thereupon she was apprehended, and sent to Prison. Nay, the rude Soldiers were encouraged to Cruelty by Officers who were not a Whit better, for they themselves would sometimes lay vio∣lent Hands on peaceable People; as amongst the rest the aforemention'd Alderman <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> who formerly had been a Major General un∣der <HI>Cromwel,</HI> and now behaved himself with such outrageous Fierceness, that even the Comedians did not stick to expose him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Relation of Alderman <HI>Brown</HI>'s Cru∣elties publish∣ed, and pre∣sented to the Mayor and Sheriffs.</NOTE> by an Allusion to his Name <HI>Brown,</HI> and saying, <HI>The Devil was brown.</HI></P>
<P>A Book was also printed, wherein many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase Abuses, and also his furious Behaviour were expos'd to publick View; and this Book was dedicated to him with this small Epistle:</P>

<P>The said Book, tho' publish'd without the Author's Name, yet one of them was not only sent to <HI>Brown,</HI> but as a Sign that the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, owned it, others were, by about thirty of them, delivered to the Lord Mayor, and the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> that so they might know what was acted under their Authority; for some, tho' not authorized, yet being Favourites at Court, made bold to act against the <HI>Quakers</HI> whatever their Malice prompted them to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arbitrary Proceedings of <HI>Philip Miller,</HI> who without Warrant takes up <HI>J.

Some Days after, this <HI>Miller</HI> came to the said Meeting-place again, and struck several Persons with his Cane, because they would not depart at his Command; and then he charged the Constables, whom he brought along with him, to secure and take in∣to Custody whom he pleased.</P>
<P>About the latter End of the aforesaid Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And of Capt. <HI>Reeves</HI> at the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Mouth,</HI> who is supported by Alderman <HI>Brown</HI> with great Fury.</NOTE> on a First-day of the Week, one Captain <HI>Reeves,</HI> and some Soldiers with Muskets and drawn Swords, came violently rushing into the <HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> Meeting, where they pulled down him that was preaching, and presently laid hold of another, who desired <HI>Reeves</HI> to shew his Order for this his doing: To which he answered, <HI>He would not in that Place;</HI> but it appeared after∣wards that he could not, as having no Warrant. Yet he caused his Soldiers to take away about forty Persons, (some of whom were not at the Meeting, but had been taken up in the Streets) and have them into <HI>Paul's Yard,</HI> where they were kept till the publick Worship was ended there; and then Alderman <HI>Richard Brown</HI> came into the Place where the Prisoners were guarded, and with great Rage and Fury laid Hands first on a very aged Person, and pulled him down twice by the Brim of his Hat, whereby he lost it. Then he served another in like Manner, and a Soldier struck this Person a great Blow with a Pistol on his bare Head: Two others <HI>Brown</HI> used in the like Manner, and then he sent them all to <HI>Newgate,</HI> guarded by Soldiers.</P>
<P>The same Day some Soldiers came to a Meeting in <HI>Tower-street,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Twenty one Persons seized by Soldiers, with at War∣rant at a Meeting, and carried before the said <HI>Brown,</HI> who sends them to Newgate</NOTE> and without any Warrant took away twenty one Persons, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and carried them to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> where they kept them some Time, and then brought them before the said <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> who in a most furious Manner, struck some, and kick'd others; which made one of the Prisoners, seeing how <HI>Brown</HI> smote one with his Fist on the Face, and kick'd him on the Shin, say, <HI>What</HI> Richard, <HI>wilt thou turn Murderer? Thou didst not do so when I was a Soldier under thy Command at</HI> Abingdon, <HI>and thou commanded'st me with others to search People's Houses for Pyes and Roast-meat, because they kept</HI> Christmas <HI>as a holy Time; and we brought the Persons Prisoners to the Guard for observing the same.</HI> For such a precise Man the said <HI>Brown</HI> was at that Time, that he pretended to root out that
<PB N="339" REF="003104_0350_0FEFF65F58BB3CE0"/>
superstitious Custom; tho' there's Reason to question whether his Heart were sincere in this Respect: However, such blind Zeal was unfit to con∣vince People of Superstition; and <HI>Brown</HI> well knowing that by his former Carriage he had very much disobliged those of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> endeavoured now to make amends for it by his fierce Brutality against the harmless <HI>Quakers,</HI> and so to come into Favour with the Ecclesiasticks and Courtiers. One of <HI>Brown</HI>'s Family having heard what was said to him, reply'd, <HI>There's an</HI> Abingdon <HI>Bird.</HI> To which <HI>Brown</HI> return'd, <HI>He is a Rogue for all that,</HI> and struck him with his Fist under the Chin, which made another Prisoner say, <HI>What, a Magistrate and strike!</HI> Upon which <HI>Brown</HI> with both his Hands pull'd him down to the Ground by the Brim of his Hat, and then commanded the Soldiers to take them all away, and carry them all to <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>Upon a First Day of the Week,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Others taken at the <HI>Bull &amp; Mouth,</HI> and by him sent to <HI>Newgate.</HI></NOTE> in the Month called <HI>June,</HI> a Com∣pany of Soldiers came into the <HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> Meeting, with Pikes, drawn Swords, Muskets, and lighted Matches, as if they were going to fig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; tho' they knew well enough they should find none there but harmless People. The first Thing they did was to pull down him that preached, whom they haled out of the Meeting, rejoicing as if they had obtained some great Victory: Then they brought him to the Main-guard at <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and returned to the <HI>Bull and Mouth,</HI> where they apprehended some more, whom they also carried to <HI>Paul</HI>'s. After some Hours these Prisoners were carried to the House of the fore-mentioned <HI>Brown;</HI> and he asking the Names of the Prisoners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Among them <HI>J. Perrot</HI> answers to <HI>Brown.</HI></NOTE> and hearing that of <HI>John Perrot,</HI> said, <HI>What, you have been at</HI> Rome, <HI>to subvert,</HI> but recalling himself, said, <HI>to convert the Pope.</HI> On which <HI>Perrot</HI> told him, <HI>He had suffered at</HI> Rome <HI>for the Testimony of Jesus.</HI> Whereupon <HI>Brown</HI> returned, <HI>If you had converted the Pope to your Religion, I should have liked him far worse than I do now.</HI> To which <HI>Perrot</HI> replied, <HI>But God would have liked him better.</HI> After some more short Discourse, <HI>Brown</HI> committed them all to <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>After this Manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Barbarity of one <HI>Cox,</HI> a Wine-Cooper.</NOTE> the Meetings of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were disturb∣ed at that Time, of which I could produce, if necessary, many more lnstances. Once one <HI>Cox,</HI> a Wine-Cooper, came with some Soldiers into a Meeting, where, after great Violence used, they took up two Men of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> whom they beat most grievously, because they refused to go along with them, tho' they shewed no Warrant for it. At length the Soldiers carried them both upon Muskets into <HI>Paul</HI>'s Yard; and when they laid them down, they dragged one of them by the Heels on his Back, in a very barbarous Manner; which being done, the said Wine-Cooper was heard to say, <HI>He would go and get a Cup of Sack, for these Devils had even wearied him out:</HI> And yet he went to another Meet∣ing-place of these People, where he also behaved himself very wicked∣ly; and being asked for his Order, his Answer was, holding out his Sword, <HI>This is my Order.</HI> Thus it seems he would ingratiate himself with <HI>Brown,</HI> who now being in Favour at Court, was knighted, and some∣time after also chosen Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI> and by his furious Be∣haviour the Soldiers were also encouraged to commit all Manner of Mis∣chief; insomuch, that being ask'd, what Order they had for their Do∣ings, one lifting up his Musket, said, <HI>This is my Order:</HI> So that Things now were carried by Club-Law. Nor did the Soldiers respect Age, but took away out of a Meeting at <HI>Mile-End,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Boys ta∣ken at <HI>Mile-End</HI> are sent to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> yet remain stedfast.</NOTE> two Boys, one about thirteen, and the other about sixteen, who were brought before the Lieute∣nant of the Tower, who to one present, saying, <HI>He supposed they were not of the Age of sixteen Years, and then not punishable by the Act,</HI> returned, <HI>They were old enough to be whipt; and they should be whipt out of their Religion.</HI> And so he sent them to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> where their Hands were put into the Stocks, and so pinched for the Space of two Hours, that their Wrists
<PB N="340" REF="003104_0351_0FEFF6ABF89E6668"/>
were much swoln; and this was done because they refused to work, as being perswaded that they had not deserved to be treated so; they also eating nothing at the Charge of the said Work-house. These Lads, tho' pretty long in that Prison, yet continued stedfast, rejoycing they were counted worthy to suffer for the Name of the Lord; and they wrote a Letter to their Friends Children, exhorting them to be faithful in bear∣ing their Testimony for the Lord, against all Wickedness and Unrigh∣teousness.</P>
<P>Some Days before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Private Dwellings broke open, and visiting term'd a Meeting.</NOTE> <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>John Herbert,</HI> living in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and other Musketeers, came with their naked Swords into some pri∣vate Dwellings, and broke two or three Doors; (for when some Persons were seen to enter a House, tho' it was only to visit their Friends, it was called a Meeting.)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five Persons only being in a House are sent to <HI>Bride∣wel</HI> by Alder∣man <HI>Brown.</HI></NOTE> Now it happened in one House these rude Fellows found five Persons together, one of whom was <HI>William Ames,</HI> who was come thither out of <HI>Holland,</HI> and another was <HI>Samuel Fisher:</HI> And when it was demanded what Warrant they had, they held up their Swords, and said <HI>Do not ask us for a Warrant; this is our Warrant:</HI> And thereupon they took away these Persons by Force, and carried them to <HI>Paul's Yard,</HI> where they were a laughing-stock to the Soldiers; and from thence they were brought to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> where they met with no better Reception from the rude Soldiers; and from thence they were conducted to Alderman <HI>Brown</HI>'s House in <HI>Ivy-Lane.</HI> He seeing these Prisoners, sent them to <HI>Bridewel</HI> with a <HI>Mittimus,</HI> to be kept; at hard La∣bour. But afterwards bethinking himself, and finding that his <HI>Mittimus</HI> was not founded on Justice, (for these Persons were not taken from a Meet∣ing) next Morning he sent another <HI>Mittimus,</HI> wherein they were charged with <HI>unlawful assembling themselves to Worship.</HI> Now suppose one of the Musketeers had heard any of these Persons speak by Way of Exhortation to Faithfulness in this hot Time of Persecution, this would have been taken for sufficient Charge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Ames</HI> be∣ing sick and near Death, discharged</NOTE> tho' not cognizable by Law: But they ran up∣on Shifts, how poor or silly soever. Thus these Persons were commit∣ted to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> and required to beat Hemp; and they were treated so severely, that <HI>W. Ames</HI> grew sick, even nigh to Death, wherefore he was discharged; for in a Sense it might be said, that his Dwelling-place was at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> since he was there the most Part of the Time for some Years, successively, and that he might not be chargeable, he work'd at Wool-combing; and it being alledged that he was of <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI> it seems they would not have him die in Prison, as some of his Friends had done. The others having been six Weeks in <HI>Bridewel,</HI> were presented at the Sessions in the <HI>Old Bayly:</HI> But instead of being try'd for what was charged against them, they were required to take the Oath of Allegiance, as the only Business (according to what the Deputy Recor∣der said) they were brought thither for. The Prisoners then demanded, that the Law might be read, by Virtue of which the said Oath was re∣quired of them. This was promised by the Court to be done; but in∣stead thereof they ordered the Clerk to read only the Form of the Oath, but would not permit the Law for imposing it to be read. But before the Prisoners had either declared their Willingness to take it, or their Refusal of it, they were commanded to be taken away; which the Offi∣cers did with such Violence, that they threw some of them down upon the Stones. This made <HI>Samuel Fisher</HI> say, <HI>Take Notice People, that we have not yet refused to take the Oath; but the Court refuseth to perform their Promise which they made but just now before you all, that the Statute for it should be read. If such Doings as this ever prosper, It must be when there is no God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The rest with <HI>J.

<PB N="341" REF="003104_0352_0FEFF6666F9939F8"/>
being brought before him, did not tell on a sudden what was his Name: And being demanded in the Court why he did not tell his Name, he answered, <HI>Because he had been beaten and abused in the Presence of</HI> Richard Brown, <HI>when he was brought before him. Brown,</HI> who was also on the Bench, ask'd him roughly, <HI>Wherein were you abused?</HI> And <HI>Howel</HI> replied, <HI>Blood was drawn on me in thy Presence; which ought not to be done in the Pre∣sence of a Justice of Peace.</HI> But <HI>Brown</HI> growing very impetuous, return'd, <HI>Hold your Prating, or there shall as much be done again here in the Presence of the Court.</HI></P>

To which <HI>Baker</HI> said, <HI>The Servants of God in the Apostles Days were commanded to speak no more in the Name of Jesus; and they answered, (and so do I too,) Whether it be better to obey God than Men, judge ye.</HI> He also instanced the Case of the three Children at <HI>Babylon,</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> who obey'd not the King's Decrees.

This these Fellows did to please <HI>Brown,</HI> shewing themselves to be ready for any Service, how abomina∣ble soever. And <HI>Baker</HI> reflecting on his Travels, signified, that even <HI>Turks</HI> and Heathens would abhor such brutish Actions. His Fellow-Prisoners were also abused by <HI>Brown,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">All of them sent to <HI>New∣gate.</HI></NOTE> and then sent to <HI>Newgate</HI> again. And after some Days they were called to the Sessions, where their In∣dictment was read, which like others in such Cases did generally run in these Terms; <HI>That the Prisoners, under Pretence of performing religious Wor∣ship, otherwise than by the Laws of the Kingdom of</HI> England <HI>established, un∣lawfully and tumultuously did gather and assemble themselves together, to the great Terror of his Majesty's People, and to the Disturbance of the Peace of the King, in Contempt of our said Lord the King, and his Laws, to the evil Ex∣ample of all others in the like Case offending,</HI> &amp;c. The Indictment being read, no Witness appeared against the Prisoners, save <HI>Brown,</HI> who sate on the Bench: And therefore the Oath, as the ordinary Snare, was tendered to them; for it was sufficiently known, that their Profession did not suffer them to take any Oath. They denying to swear, were sent back to Prison, to stay there until they should have taken the Oath. If I would here set down all such like Cases as have happened, I might find more Work than I should be able to perform: For this vexing with the Oath was become so common, that some have been taken up in the Streets, and brought to a Justice of Peace, that he might ten∣der the Oath to them, and in Case of Denial, send them to Prison, tho' this was directly contrary to the Statute of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To take u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Persons arbi∣trarily, to ten∣der Oaths to, contrary to <HI>Magna Char∣ta.</HI></NOTE> which expresly saith, <HI>No Freeman shall be taken nor imprisoned, or be disseized of his Freehold or Liberties, but by the Law of the Land.</HI> But this was not regarded by <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> who did whatever he would; for Force and Violence were now predominant: And sometimes when the Pri∣soners were brought to the Bar, for frequenting Meetings, Freedom was denied them to justify themselves; but to be hector'd and ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed was their Lot.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="003104_0353_0FEFF6AE74C65C58"/>Once it happened that a Prisoner, who had been a Soldier formerly under <HI>Brown,</HI> seeing that no Justice or Equity was observed, called to him saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Prisoner boldly charges <HI>Brown</HI> on the Bench with Murder which he denies not.</NOTE> <HI>That he was not fit to sit on the Bench; for he made the Son to hang the Father at</HI> Abingdon; <HI>so that he could prove him to be a Murderer.</HI> This bold Saying caused some Disturbance in the Court, and <HI>Brown,</HI> how heavy soever the Charge was, did not deny the Thing in Court, nor clear himself from it: Yet the other <HI>Quaker</HI> Prisoners did not ap∣prove this Upbraiding, but signified, <Q>That tho' the Fact were true, yet they were not for reproaching any Magistrate upon the Bench, whose Place and Office they did respect and honour.</Q> But I don't find that <HI>Brown</HI> (on that Account) ever prosecuted him that spoke so boldly, altho' otherwise he did whatever he would, without fearing that his Fellow-Magistrates, who respected him that was a Favourite at Court, would disclaim it, as may appear by this following Instance.</P>
<P>A certain Person, who had been taken by the Soldiers out of a Meet∣ing to Prison, in a very violent and abusive manner, because he was not willing to go, said in the Court, <HI>That his refusing to go, was because they would not shew him any Warrant for their apprehending him; since for ought he knew, they might be Robbers or Murd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rers, with whom he was not bound to go.</HI> But <HI>Brown,</HI> who was for violence, said to this, <HI>If they had dragg'd him thro' all the Kennels in the Streets, they had served him right, if he would not go.</HI> This he spoke in such a furious Manner, that one of the Prisoners told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another see∣ing him furi∣ous, tenderly warns him, notwithstand∣ing outragious Violence con∣tinues in the Court.</NOTE> <HI>Thou hast had many Warnings and Visitations in the Love of God, but hast slighted them; therefore beware of being sealed up in the Wrath of God.</HI> Here∣upon one of the Jailors came with his Cane and struck several of the Prisoners so hard, that divers of them were much bruised; and it was reported by some, that <HI>Brown</HI> cried, <HI>Knock him down,</HI> tho' others (for mitigating it a little) would have it, <HI>Pull, him down:</HI> But the former seems most probable; for the Blows were so violent, that some of the Spectators cry'd out <HI>Murder! Murder!</HI> and ask'd, <HI>Will ye suffer Men to be murdered in the Court?</HI> Whereupon one of the Sheriffs in Person came down from his Seat to stop the Beating. But <HI>Brown,</HI> was so desperate∣ly fill'd with Anger, that he said to the Prisoners, <HI>If any of you be kil∣led, your Blood shall be on your own Head:</HI> And the Hangman standing by with his Gag in his Hand, threatned the Prisoners to gag any of them, that should speak any Thing. Thus Innocence was forced to give Way to Violence. And once, when one at the common juridical Question, <HI>Guilty, or not guilty,</HI> answered, <HI>I deny I am guilty, and I can say I am not guilty;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">One sentenced as mute, and fined for an∣swering, I can say, I am not guilty.</NOTE> and also in <HI>Latin, Non reus sum.</HI> Yet he was sentenced as mute, and fined accordingly, tho' the Words he spoke, fully signified, <HI>not guilty,</HI> albeit he had not express'd them in the same Terms. But now they were for crossing the <HI>Quakers</HI> in every Respect.</P>
<P>I'll yet mention some more Instances of <HI>Brown</HI>'s Brutality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther In∣stances of <HI>Brown</HI>'s un∣becoming be∣haviour.</NOTE> before I leave him. Another being demanded to answer to his Indictment, <HI>Guilty, or not Guilty,</HI> and not presently answering, but thinking a little what to speak safely, <HI>Brown</HI> scoffingly said, <HI>We shall have a Revelation by and by.</HI> To which the Prisoner said, <HI>How long will ye oppose the Innocent? How long will ye persecute the righteous Seed of God?</HI> But whilst he was speaking, <HI>Brown</HI> indecently began to cry in the Language of those Wenches that go crying up and down the Streets, <HI>Aha, Aha! Will you have any Wall-fleet Oysters?</HI> and, <HI>Have you any Kitchin-stuff, Maids?</HI> And when a Pri∣soner at the Bar said, <HI>He could not for Conscience-sake forbear meeting among the People of God: Brown</HI> scurrilously returned, <HI>Conscience, a Dog's Tail.</HI> And when Alderman <HI>Adams</HI> speaking to one of the Prisoners, said, <HI>I am sorry to see you here. Sorry?</HI> said <HI>Brown, What should you be sor∣ry for! Yes,</HI> said <HI>Adams, He is a sober Man.</HI> But <HI>Brown,</HI> who could not endure to hear this, reply 'd, <HI>That there was never a sober Man amongst

them,</HI> meaning the <HI>Quakers.</HI> The Spectators, who took much Notice of him, discommended this his Carriage exceedingly. But he seemed to be quite hardened; for at a certain Time, two Persons being upon their Trial for robbing of a House, he told them, <HI>They were the veriest Rogues in</HI> England, <HI>except it were the</HI> Quakers.</P>
<P>Sometimes it happened that the Prisoners were brought to the Bar, without being indicted; and when they said. <HI>What have we done?</HI> and desired Justice; <HI>Brown</HI> having no Indictment against them, often cry'd, <HI>Will you take the Oath?</HI> And they then saying, That <HI>For Conscience-sake they could not swear,</HI> were condemned as Transgressors, tho' such Pro∣ceedings as these, were directly against the Law. But this seemed at that Time little to be regarded.</P>
<P>However some Time before, it happened at <HI>Thetford</HI> in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> that Judge <HI>Windham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Judge <HI>Wind∣ham</HI> sharply reproves th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Justices for committing Persons and bringing them to the Bar without an Accuser.</NOTE> at that Time shewing himself just in the like Case, sharply reproved the Justices upon the Bench, for ha∣ving not only committed some Persons to Prison, but also had them up to the Bar, when no Accuser appeared against them. But <HI>Richard Brown</HI> did whatever he would, and shewed himself most furiously wick∣ed, when any Prisoner was brought before him with his Hat on.</P>
<P>One <HI>John Brain</HI> being taken in the Street, and not in any Meeting, was brought by some Soldiers before <HI>Brown,</HI> who seeing him with his Hat on,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Brain</HI>'s most cruel U∣sage by the Order and in the Presence of <HI>R. Brown,</HI> who after∣ward sent him to Prison.</NOTE> ordered him to be pulled down to the Ground six or seven Times; and when he was down, they beat his Head against the Ground, and stampt upon him; and <HI>Brown</HI> like a Mad-man, bad them pull off his Nose; whereupon they very violently pull'd him by the Nose. And when he was got up, they pull'd him to the Ground by the Hair of his Head, and then by the Hair pull'd him up again. And when he would have spoken in his own Behalf against this Cruelty, <HI>Brown</HI> bad them <HI>Stop his Mouth:</HI> Whereupon they not only struck him on the Mouth, but stopped his Mouth and Nose also so close, that he could not draw Breath, and was like to be choaked: At which Actions <HI>Brown</HI> fell a laughing, and at length sent him to Jail.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Spire</HI> being brought before <HI>Brown,</HI> he commanded his Hat to be taken off;<NOTE PLACE="marg">More In∣stances of <HI>Brown</HI>'s bar∣barous Beha∣viour to <HI>T. Spire.</HI></NOTE> and because it was not done with such Violence as he in∣tended, he caused it to be put upon his Head again, saying, <HI>It should not be pull'd off so easily:</HI> Then he was pulled down to the Ground by his Hat, and pulled up again by his Hair. <HI>William Hill</HI> being brought before him, he commanded his Hat to be pulled off, so that his Head might be bowed down; whereupon he being pulled to the Ground, was pluckt up again by the Hair of his Head. <HI>George Ableson</HI> was thus pulled five Times one after another to the Ground, and pluck'd up by his Hair, and so beaten on his Face, or the Sides of his Head, that he staggered and bled, and for some Days was under much Pain.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Blithold</HI> being brought before <HI>Brown,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N.

But I grow weary of mentioning more Instances of his Cruelty. These his abominable Atchievements were published in Print, mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at large than I have mentioned them; and the Book as hath been said already, was dedicated to him.

<P>THE Cogitations of my Heart have been many,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. Howgil</HI>'s Paper for In∣couragment of his Suffering Friends.</NOTE> deep, and ponderous some Months, Weeks, and Days concerning this People which the Lord hath raised to bear Testimony unto his Name, in this the Day of his Power; and Intercession hath been made often for them to the Lord and a patient Waiting to know his Mind concerning them for the Time to come; which often I received Satisfaction in as to my self; but yet something I was drawn by the Lord, to wait for, that I might comfort and strengthen his Flock by an assured Testimony. And while I was waiting out of all visible Things, and quite out of the World in my Spirit, and my Heart upon nothing but the living God, the Lord opened the Springs of the great Deep, and overflowed my whole Heart with Life and Love; and my Eyes were as a Fountain, because of Tears of Joy, because of his Heritage, of whom he shewed me and said unto me in a full, fresh, living Power, and a holy, full Testimony, so that my Heart was ravished there with Joy un∣speakable, and I was out of this Body with God, in his heavenly Paradise, where I saw and felt Things unutterable, and beyond all Demonstration or Speech. At last the Life closed with my Ʋnderstanding, and my Spirit listened unto him; and the everlasting God said, shall I hide any thing from them that seek my Face in Righteousness? Nay, I will manifest it to them that fear me; I will speak, do thou listen, and publish it among all my People, that they may be comforted and thou satisfied. <HI>And thus said the Living God of Heaven and Earth, upon the 28th of the 3d Month, 1662.</HI></P>
<P>The Sun shall leave its shining Brightness, and cease to give Light to the World; and the Moon shall be altogether Darkness, and give no Light unto the Night; the Stars shall cease to know their Office or Place; my Covenant with Day, Night, Times and Seasons shall sooner come to an End, than the Cove∣nant I have made with this People, into which they are entered with me, shall end or be broken. Yea, tho' the Powers of Darkness and Hell combine against them, and the Jaws of Death open its Mouth, yet I will deliver them, and lead them through all. I will confound their Enemies as I did in <HI>Jacob,</HI> and scatter them as I did in <HI>Israel</HI> in the Days of Old. I will take their Enemies, I will hur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them hither and thither as Stones hurled in a Sling; and the Memorial of this Nation, which is holy unto me, shall never be routed out, but shall live thro' Ages, as a Cloud of Witnesses in Generations to come. I have brought them to the Birth, yea, I have brought them forth; I have swaddled them, and they are mine. I will nourish them, and carry them as on Eagles Wings; and tho' Clouds gather against them, I will make my Way thro' them: Tho' Darkness gather together on a Heap, and Tempests gender, I will scatter them as with an East-Wind; and Nations shall know they are my Inheritance, and they shall know I am the living God, who will plead their Cause with all that rise up in Opposition against them.</P>
<P>These Words are holy, faithful, eternal, good and true: Blessed are they that hear and believe unto the End; and because of them no Strength was left in me for a while; but at last my Heart was filled with Joy, even as when the Ark of God was brought from the House of <HI>Obed-Edom,</HI> when <HI>David</HI> danced be∣fore it, and <HI>Israel</HI> shouted for Joy.</P>

<P>That this Writing of <HI>F. Howgil,</HI> who was a pious Man, of great Parts, together with many other powerful Exhortations of such who valiantly went before, and never left the oppressed Flock, tended ex∣ceedingly to their Encouragement in this hot Time of Persecution, is certain. For how furious soever their Enemies were, yet they were re∣solved to continue faithful in Supplications and fervent Prayers to God, that he might be pleased to assist them in their upright Zeal, who aim'd
<PB N="345" REF="003104_0356_0FEFF66AA1A83218"/>
at nothing for Self, but from a true Fear and Reverence before him, durst not omit their Religious Assemblies. And they found that the Lord heard their Prayers, insomuch that I remember to have heard one say, that at a Meeting where they seemed to be in Danger of Death from their fierce Persecutors, he was as it were ravished, so that he hardly knew whether he was in or out of the Body. They then perse∣vering thus in Faithfulness to what they believed the Lord required of them, in Process of Time, when their Enemies had taken such Mea∣sures that they were perswaded they had found out such Means, by which they should suppress and extinguish the <HI>Quakers,</HI> they saw the Lord God Almighty rose up in their Defence, and quash'd and confound∣ed the wicked Devices of their cruel Persecutors, as will be seen in the Course of this History.</P>
<P>In the mean while let us take a View of the Persecution in <HI>Southwark.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in <HI>Southwark.</HI></NOTE> Here the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings were no less disturbed than in <HI>London.</HI> Se∣veral Persons having been taken from their religious Meetings, were committed; and after having been in <HI>White-Lion</HI> Prison about nine Weeks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Per∣sons indicted.</NOTE> were brought to the Bar, where <HI>Richard Onslow</HI> sate Judge of the Sessions. The Indictment drawn up against them was as followeth,</P>
<P><HI>The Jurors for our Lord the King do present upon their Oath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indict∣ment.</NOTE> <HI>that</HI> Arthur Fisher, <HI>late of the Parish of</HI> St. Olave <HI>in the Borough of</HI> Southwark, <HI>in the County of</HI> Surrey, <HI>Yeoman,</HI> Nathanael Robinson, <HI>of the same, Yeoman;</HI> John Chandler <HI>of the same, Yeoman, and others, being wicked, dangerous, and seditious Sectaries, and disloyal Persons, and above the Age of sixteen Years, who or the 29th Day of</HI> June, <HI>in the Year of the Reign of our Lord</HI> Charles <HI>the Second, by the Grace of God, King of</HI> England, Scotland, France <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>&amp;c. the Fourteenth, have obstinately refused, and every one of them hath obstinately refused to repair unto some Church, Chappel, or usual Place of Common-Prayer, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>in the like Case set forth and provided (after Forty Days next after the End of the Session of Parliament, begun and holden at</HI> Westminster, <HI>on the 19th Day of</HI> February, <HI>in the Year of our Lady</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>late Queen of</HI> England, <HI>the thirty-fifth, and there continued until the Dissolution of the same, being the tenth Day of</HI> April, <HI>in the 35th Year abovesaid,) To wit on the 3d Day of</HI> August, <HI>in the Year of the Reign of the said</HI> Charles, <HI>King of</HI> England, <HI>the fourteenth abovesaid, in the Parish of St.</HI> Olave <HI>aforesaid, in the Borough of</HI> Southwark <HI>aforesaid, in the County aforesaid; of themselves, did, voluntarily and unlawfully join in, and were present at an unlawful Assembly, Conventicle, and Meeting, at the said Parish of St.</HI> Olave, <HI>in the County aforesaid, under Colour and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etence of the Exercise of Religion, against the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom of</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>in Contempt of our said Lord the King that now is, his Laws, and to the evil and dangerous Example of all others in the like Case offending against the Peace of our said Lord the King that now is, his Crown and Dignity, and con∣trary to the Form of the Statute in this same Case set forth and provided.</HI></P>
<P>I have inserted this Indictment, that the Reader may see not only the Manner of proceeding, but also with what black and heinous Co∣lours the Religious Meetings of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were represented. This lndictment being read, the Prisoners desired that they might be tri∣ed by the late Act of Parliament against Conventicles. But it was an∣swered, They might try them by what they would, that was in Force. Then the Prisoners desired that that Statute (<HI>viz.</HI> the 35th of <HI>Eliza∣heth</HI>) might be read. This was done but in Part, and it was said to the Clerk, <HI>It was enough.</HI> The Prisoners said then, That <HI>that Act was made in the Times of Ignorance, when the People were but newly stept out of Po∣pery;</HI> and they shewed also how unjustly they were dealt with. Then being required to plead <HI>Guilty</HI> or <HI>Not guilty</HI> to the Indictment, some who
<PB N="346" REF="003104_0357_0FEFF6B597FFFF48"/>
were not very forward to answer, were haled out of the Court, as taken <HI>pro confessis;</HI> and so sent back to Prison. The rest, being twenty-two in Number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some dilatory in their An∣swer, sent back to Prison. Others plead Not guilty.</NOTE> pleaded <HI>Not guilty.</HI> Then the Jurymen were called, and when they excepted against one, the Judge would not allow it, because he did not like the Reason they gave, <HI>viz.</HI> That they saw Envy, Preju∣dice, and a vain Deportment in him. Another was excepted against, because he was heard to say, <HI>That he hoped ere long, that the</HI> Quakers <HI>should be arraigned at the Bar, and be banished to some Land, where there was nothing but Bears.</HI> At this the Court burst out into a Laughter; yet the Ex∣ception was admitted, and the Man put by. The Prisoners not think∣ing it convenient to make more Exceptions, the Jury were sworn. Then two Witnesses were called, who testify'd at most, that in such a Place they took such Persons met together, whose Names were specified in Writing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Answer.</NOTE> Then the Prisoners bid the Jury, <Q>Take heed how they did sport or dally with holy Things, and that those Things, which concern∣ed the Conscience, were holy Things. And as a Man was not to sport with the Health or Illness of his Neighbour, so he was not to sport with the Liberty or the Banishment of his Neighbour. And whereas they were accused of being wicked, dangerous, and seditious Sectaries; that was not true; for they were not wicked, but such as endeavour∣ed to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the World; concerning the Truth of which, they appealed to themselves. Neither were they seditious, but peaceable. And whereas they were charged for not coming to hear the <HI>Common-prayer,</HI> this was incongruous; for the <HI>Ser∣vice-Book</HI> was not quite printed several Weeks after the said 29th of <HI>June;</HI> so that they could not be charged of neglecting to hear that which was not to be heard read any where.</Q> This puzzled the Court not a little; and other pinching Reasons were also given by the Prison∣ers, some of which were Men of Learning; insomuch that the Judge was not able to answer the Objections but by Shifts and Evasions. At length the Jury went out to consult; and one of them was heard to say, as they were going up Stairs, <HI>Here is a deal to do indeed to condemn a Company of innocent Men.</HI></P>
<P>After some Time, the Jury coming in again, and being asked, Whe∣ther the Prisoners at the Bar were guilty or not guilty, they said, <HI>They were guilty in Part,</HI> and <HI>not guilty in Part.</HI> But this Verdict did not please the Judge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are brought in guilty by the Jury after twice going out.</NOTE> The Jury then going out again, and prevailing upon one another, quickly returned, and declared the Prisoners <HI>guilty, according to the Form of the Indictment.</HI> Hereupon the Judge <HI>Onslow</HI> pronounced Sen∣tence, <HI>viz. That they should return to Prison again, and lie there three Months without Bail; and if they did not make Submission according as the Law di∣rected, either at, or before the End of the aforesaid three Months, that then they should abjure the Realm: But in case they refused to make Abjuration, or af∣ter Abjuration made, should forbear to depart the Realm within the Time limi∣ted, or should return again without Licence, they should be proceeded against as Felons.</HI></P>
<P>Just before Sentence given, the Judge said to one of the Prisoners, <HI>There was a Way to escape the Penal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> viz. <HI>Submission.</HI> And being asked, <HI>What that was?</HI> The Judge answered, <HI>To come to</HI> Common-Prayer, <HI>and re∣frain these Meetings.</HI> The Prisoner giving Reasons for Refusal of both, the Judge said, <HI>Then you must abjure the Land. Abjure,</HI> returned the Priso∣ner, is <HI>forswear.</HI> To which one of the Justices said laughingly, <HI>And ye cannot swear at all.</HI> Just as if it were but Jest, thus to treat religious Men. But they had signified already to the Jury, <HI>That they must rather die than do so.</HI> How long they were kept Prisoners, and how released, I could not learn; but this I know, that many in the like Cases have been long kept in Jail, till sometimes they were set at Liberty by the King's Proclamation.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="003104_0358_0FEFF66E44930928"/>In this Year it was the Share of <HI>John Crook</HI> (who himself once had been a Justice) to be taken out of a Meeting at <HI>London</HI> in <HI>John's Street,</HI> as hath been said already, by one <HI>Miller,</HI> tho' not in Office. And he with others was brought to his Trial in the said City before the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> the Recorder of the same, the Chief Justice <HI>Forster,</HI> and other Judges and Justices, among which was also <HI>Richard Brown.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Call</HI> John Crook <HI>to the Bar;</HI> which the Cryer did accor∣dingly, he being amongst the <HI>Felons,</HI> as aforesaid.</P>

<STAGE><HI>John Crook</HI> being brought to the Bar:</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C. Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>When did you take the Oath of Allegiance?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Crook.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire to be heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C. Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Answer to the Question, and you shall be heard.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Cr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been about six Weeks in Prison, and am I now called to accuse my self? For the answering to this Question in the Nega∣tive, is to accuse my self, which you ought not to put me upon; for, <HI>Nemo debet seipsum prodere.</HI> I am an <HI>Englishman,</HI> and by the Law of <HI>England</HI> I ought not to be taken, nor imprisoned, nor disseized of my Freehold, nor called in question, nor put to answer, but according to the Law of the Land; which I challenge as my Birthright, on my own Behalf, and all that hear me this Day; (or Words to this Purpose) I stand here at this Bar as a Delinquent, and do desire that my Ac∣cuser may be brought forth to accuse me for my Delinquency, and then I shall answer to my Charge, (if any I be guilty of.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C. Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You are here demanded to take the Oath of Allegiance, and when, you have done that, then you shall be heard about the other; for we have Pow∣er to tender it to any Man.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Cr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to me upon this Occasion, in this Place; for l am brought hither as an Offender already, and not to be made an Offender here, or to accuse my self; for I am an <HI>Englishman,</HI> as I have said to you, and challenge the Benefit of the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> for by them is a better Inheritance derived to me as an <HI>Englishman,</HI> than that which I received from my Parents; for by the former, the latter is preserved; and this is the 29th Chapter of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and the <HI>Petition of Right,</HI> mentioned in the third of <HI>Car.</HI> 1. and in other good Laws of <HI>England;</HI> and therefore I desire the Benefit and Observance of them: And you that are Judges upon the Bench, ought to be my Council, and not my Accusers, but to inform me of the Benefit of those Laws; and where∣in I am ignorant, you ought to inform me, that I may not suffer thro'
<PB N="348" REF="003104_0359_0FEFF6B7561B4188"/>
my own Ignorance of those Advantages which the Laws of <HI>England</HI> afford me as an <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI> I here give thee a brief Account of my Taking and Impri∣soning, that thou may'st the better judge what Justice I had from the Court aforesaid; which is as followeth;</P>
<P>I being in <HI>John's Street, London,</HI> about the thirteenth Day of the third Month (called <HI>May</HI>) with some of the People of God, to wait upon him, as we were sate together, there came in a rude Man (called <HI>Miller</HI>) with a long Cane in his Hand, who laid violent Hands upon me, with some others, beating some, commanding the Constables who came in after him, but having no Warrant, were not willing to meddle, but as his Threatnings prevailed, they being afraid of him, joyned with him to carry several of us before Justice <HI>Powel</HI> (so called) who the next Day sent us to the Sessions at <HI>Hick's-Hall;</HI> where after some Discourse several Times with them, manifesting to them the Ille∣gality both of our Commitment, and their Proceedings thereupon; yet notwithstanding, they committed me and others, and caused an Indict∣ment to be drawn against us, founded upon the late Act against <HI>Quakers and others,</HI> and then remanded us to <HI>New-Prison,</HI> where we continued for some Days, and then removed us to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where we remained un∣til the Sessions in the <HI>Old Bailey</HI> aforesaid: Whereby thou may'st under∣stand what Justice I met withal, by what went before, and now farther follows.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We sit here to do Justice, and are upon our Oaths; and we are to tell you what is Law, and not you us: Therefore, Sirrah, you are too bold.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Crook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah is not a Word becoming a Judge; for I am no Felon; neither ought you to menace the Prisoner at the Bar: For I stand here arraigned as for my Life and Liberty, and the Preservation of my Wife and Children, and outward Estate, [they being now at the Stake] there∣fore you ought to hear me to the full, what I can say in my own De∣fence, according to Law, and that in its Season, as it is given me to speak: Therefore I hope the Court will bear with me, if I am bold to assert my Liberty, as an <HI>Englishman,</HI> and as a Christian; and if I speak loud, it is my Zeal for the Truth, and for the Name of the Lord; and mine Innocency makes me bold—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>It is an evil Zeal;</HI> [interrupting <HI>John Crook].</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am bold in the Name of the Lord God Almighty, the everlasting <HI>Jehovah,</HI> to assert the Truth, and stand as a Witness for it: Let my Accuser be brought forth, and I am ready to answer any Court of Justice.—</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the Judge interrupted me, saying, <HI>Sirrah,</HI> with some other Words I do not remember: But I answered, You are not to threaten me, neither are those Menaces fit for the Mouth of a Judge; for the Safety of the Prisoner stands upon the Indifferency of the Court: And you ought not to behave your selves as Parties, seeking all Advantages against the Prisoner, but not heeding any Thing that may make for his Clearing or Advantage.— The Judge again interrupted me, saying,</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sirrah, you are to take the Oath, and here we tender it you</HI> (bidding, read it.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see mine Accuser, that I may know for what Cause I have been six Weeks imprisoned, and do not put me to accuse my self, by asking me Questions; but either let my Accuser come forth, or o∣therwise let me be discharged by Proclamation, as you ought to do.— Here I was interrupted again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge Twisden.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We take no Notice of your being here, otherwise than of a Straggler, or as any other Person, or of the People that are here this Day; for
<PB N="349" REF="003104_0360_0FEFF67142166898"/>
we may tender the Oath to any Man.</HI> And another Judge spake to the like Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am here at your Bar as a Prisoner, restrained of my Liberty, and do question whether you ought in Justice to tender me the Oath on the Account I am now brought before you, because I am supposed to be an Offender; or else why have I been six Weeks in Prison alrea∣dy? Let me be cleared of my Imprisonment, and then I shall answer to what is charged against me, and to the Question <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow propounded; for I am a Lover of Justice with all my Soul, and am well known by my Neighbours, where I have lived, <HI>to keep a Conscience void of Offence, both towards God, and towards Man.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sirrah, leave your Canting.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this <HI>Canting,</HI> to speak the Words of the Scripture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>It's Canting in your Mouth, tho' they are</HI> Paul<HI>'s Words.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I speak the Words of the Scripture, and it is not <HI>Canting,</HI> tho' I speak them; but they are Words of Truth and Soberness in my Mouth, they being witnessed by me, and fulfilled in me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We do ask you again, whether you will take the Oath of Allegiance? It is but a short Question, you may answer if you will.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what Law have you. Power to tender it? Then after some Consultation together by Whispering, they called for the Statute-Book, and turning over the Leaves, they answered,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>By the Third of King</HI> James.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire that Statute may be read; for I have consulted it, and do not understand that you have Power by that Statute to tender me the Oath, being here before you in this Place, upon this Occasion, as a Delinquent already; and therefore I desire the Judgment of the Court in this Case, and that the Statute may be read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they took the Statute-Book, and consulted together up∣on it, and one said, <HI>We are the Judges of this Land, and do better understand our Power than you do, and we do judge we may lawfully do it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the Judgment of the Court?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire the Statute to be read that impowers you to tender the Oath to me upon this Occasion in this Place; for, <HI>Vox audita perit, sed litera scripta manet,</HI> therefore let me hear it read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hear me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am as willing to hear as to speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Then hear me: You are here required to take the Oath by the Court, and I will inform you what the Penalty will be, in Case you refuse; for your first Denial shall be recorded, and then it shall be tendred to you again at the End of the Sessions; and upon the second Refusal you run into a</HI> Premunire, <HI>which is the Forfeiture of all your Estate, (if you have any) and Imprisonment.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is Justice I stand for; let me have Justice, in bringing my Accuser <HI>Face to Face,</HI> as by Law you ought to do, I standing at your Bar as a Delinquent; and when that is done, I will answer to what can be charged against me, as also to the Question; until then, I shall give no other Answer than I have already done, (at least at present.)</P>
</SP>
<P>Then there was a Cry in the Court, <HI>Take him away,</HI> which occasion∣ed a great Interruption; and <HI>J. Crook</HI> spake to this Purpose, saying, Mind the Fear of the Lord God, that you may come to the Knowledge of his Will, and do Justice; and take heed of oppressing the Innocent, for the Lord God of Heaven and Earth will assuredly plead their Cause: And for my Part, I desire not the Hurt of one of the Hairs of your Heads; but let God's Wisdom guide you. These Words he spake at the Bar, and as he was carrying away.
<PB N="350" REF="003104_0361_0FEFF6B9A4875950"/>
On the Sixth Day of the Week, in the Forenoon following, the Court being sat, <HI>John Crook</HI> was called to the Bar.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chief Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Friend</HI> Crook, <HI>we have given you Time to consider of what was said Yesterday to you by the Court, hoping you may have better considered of it by this Time; therefore, without any more Words, will you take the Oath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> And called to the Clerk, and bid him read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not, neither do I deny <HI>Allegiance,</HI> but do desire to know the Cause of my so long Imprisonment; for, as I said, I stand at your Bar as a Delinquent, and am brought hither by Force, contrary to the Law; therefore let me see my Accuser, or else free me by Proclamation, as I ought to be, if none can accuse me: For the Law is grounded up∣on right Reason, and whatsoever is contrary to right Reason, is con∣trary to Law; and therefore if no Accuser appear, you ought to acquit me first, and then I shall answer, as I have said, If any new Matter ap∣pear; otherwise it is of Force, and that our Law abhors, and you ought not to take Notice of my so being before you; for what is not legally so, is not so; and therefore I am in the Condition, as if I were not before you: And therefore it cannot be supposed, in right Reason, that you have now Power, at this Time, and in this Place, legally to tender me the Oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Read the Oath to him;</HI> and so the Clerk began to read.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire Justice, according to the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> for you ought first to convict me, concerning the Cause of my so long Impri∣sonment: For you are to proceed according to Laws already made, and not to make Laws; for you ought to be Ministers of the Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You are a saucy and an impudent Fellow: Will you tell us what is Law, or our Duties?</HI> Then said he to the Clerk, <HI>Read on;</HI> and when the Clerk had done reading;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>said, Read the Preface to the Act; I say again, Read the Ti∣tle and Preamble to the Act; for Titles to Laws are <HI>Claves Legum,</HI> as Keys to open the Law; for by their Titles, Laws are understood and known, as Men by their Faces. Then the Judges would have inter∣rupted me, but I said as followeth: If you will not hear me, nor do me Justice; I must appeal to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who is Judge of Quick and Dead, before whom we must all appear, to give an Account for the Deeds done in the Body; for he will judge between you and me this Day, whether you have done me Justice or not.</P>
</SP>
<P>These Words following (or the like) I spake, as going from the Bar, being pulled away, <HI>viz.</HI> Mind the Fear of the Lord God, that you may do Justice, lest you perish in his Wrath. For sometimes the Court cry'd, <HI>Pull him away,</HI> and then said, <HI>Bring him again;</HI> and thus they did several Times, like Men in Confusion and Disorder.</P>
<P>The same Day, in the Afternoon, Silence being made, <HI>John Crook</HI> was called to the Bar, before the Judges and Justices aforesaid. The Indictment being read, the Judge said,</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You have heard your Indictment, what say you? Are you guil∣ty or Not Guilty?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire to speak a few Words in Humility and Soberness, in regard my Estate and Liberty lies at Stake, and am like to be a Prece∣dent for many more; therefore I hope the Court will not deny me Right and Benefit of the Law, as being an <HI>Englishman:</HI> I have some Reason, before I speak any Thing to the lndictment, to demand and tell you, that I desire to know mine Accusers; I have been kept these six Weeks in Prison, and know not, nor have not seen the Faces of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We shall afford you the Right of the Law, as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Englishman: <HI>God forbid you should be denied it; but you must answer first</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guil∣ty, <HI>that so in your Trial you may have a fair Hearing and Pleading; but if<PB N="351" REF="003104_0362_0FEFF674E976CAB8"/>
you go on as you do,</HI> (and will not answer, <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty) you will run your self into a</HI> Premunire, <HI>and then you lose the Benefit of the Law, and expose your self, Body and Estate, to great Hazards; and whatever Violence is offered to your Person or Estate, you are out of the King's Protection, and lose the Benefit of the Law; and all this by your not answering,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guil∣ty, <HI>If you plead</HI> Not Guilty, <HI>you may be heard.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is recorded in the Statutes of the 28 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. &amp; 3. and 42 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. &amp; 3. in these Words, <HI>No Man is to be taken, or imprisoned, or be put to answer without Presentment before Justices, or Matter of Record, or by due Process, or Writ-original, according to the old Law of the Land; and if any Thing from henceforth be done to the contrary, it shall be void in Law, and hol∣den for Error.</HI> And also in the 25th of <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. 2. and the 3 <HI>Car.</HI> 1. and the 29 cap. <HI>Mag.

No Freeman shall be taken and imprisoned, but by the Law of the Land:</HI> These Words <HI>[The Law of the Land]</HI> are explained by the Statute of 37 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. 8. to be <HI>without due Process of Law;</HI> and if any Judgments are given contrary to <HI>Mag.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>You are out of the Way, and do not understand the Law; tho' you adore the Statute Law so much, yet you do not understand it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have you tell me the right Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>hear me: You must say,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty: <HI>If you plead</HI> Not Guilty, <HI>you shall be heard, and know how far the Law favours you. And the next Thing is, there is no Circumstance whatsoever that is the Cause of your Imprisonment, that you question, but you have, as a Subject, your Remedies, if you will go this Way, and wave other Things, and answer,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty; <HI>and what the Law affords you, you shall have, if you do what the Law requires you; or else you will lose the Benefit of the Law, and be out of the King's Protection.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Observe how the Judge would draw me into a Snare, <HI>viz.</HI> by first pleading <HI>(Guilty or Not Guilty)</HI> and when I have done so, he, and his Brethren intend suddenly to put me (as an out-law'd Person) out of the King's Protection; and how then can I have Remedy for my false Imprisonment? Therefore first clear me, or condemn me, from my false Imprisonment, while I am in a Capacity to have the Benefit of the Law, and not to out-law me for an Offence created by your selves; and then, to stop my Mouth, you tell me, <HI>That if I have been wronged or false imprisoned, I may have my Remedy afterwards:</HI> This is to trapan me, and contrary to both Law and Justice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You must plead,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do desire in Humility and Meekness, to say, I shall not; I dare not betray the Honesty of my Cause, and the honest Ones of this Nation, whose Liberty I stand for, as well as my own; as I have a Cause to think I shall, if I plead to the present Indictment, before I see the Faces of my Accusers: For truly, I am not satisfied in my Judgment and Conscience, that I ought to plead to a created Offence by you, be∣fore I be first acquitted of the Cause of my being brought Prisoner to your Bar; and therefore it sticks with me to urge this farther, <HI>viz.</HI> That I may see my Accusers.—</P>

<P>My Case is not theirs, yet they have their Accusers; and may not I call for mine?

<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I stand as brought forcibly and violently hither; neither had I been here but by a violent Action, and that you should take no Notice of it seems strange to me; and not only so, but that you should hasten me so fast into a Course, that I should not be able any ways to help my self, by reason of your hasty and fast Proceedings against me, to put me out of the King's Protection, and the Benefit of all Law: Was ever the like known, or heard of, in a Court of Justice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Friend, this is not here in Question, whether you are unjustly brought here, or not: Do you question That by Law, but not disable your self to take Advantage by the Law: If brought by a wrong Hand, you have a Plea against them; but you must first answer</HI> Guilty <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty.</P>

<P>How can I help my self when you have outlawed me?

<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What, tho' no Man tender'd the Oath to you, when you were com∣mitted,</HI> (as you say) <HI>it being now tender'd to you; from the Time you refused it, being tendered to you by a lawful Authority, you refusing, are indi∣cted: We look not upon what you are here for, but h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding you, we tender, you the Oath; and you refusing it, your Imprisonment is now just, and accor∣ding to Law.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came I here, if you know not? I have told you it is Force and Violence, which our Law altogether condemns; and there∣fore I not being legally before, am not before you; for what is not legally so, is not so; and I not being legally brought to your Bar, you ought not to take Notice of my being here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No no, you are mistaken; so you may say of all the People gazing here, they not being</HI> legally <HI>here, are not here: I tell you, a Man being brought by Force hither, we may tender him the Oath; and if he take it not, he may be committed to Prison; Authority hath given us the Power, and the Statute-Law hath given us Authority to tender the Oath to any Person, and so have we ten∣der'd it to you; and for your not taking it, you are indicted by the Grand Jury: Answer the Accusation, or confute the Indictment; ou must do the one or the other, answer</HI> Guilty <HI>or</HI> not guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here I was interrupted, but might have said, That the People that were Spectators, beholding and hearing the Trials, are not to be call'd <HI>Gazers,</HI> as the Judge terms them; because it is their Liberty and Privilege, as they are <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and the Law of <HI>England</HI> allows the same; so that they are not to be termed <HI>Gazers</HI> upon this Account, but are legally in that Place, to hear Trials, and see Justice done, and might have spoken (if Occasion had been) any Thing in the Prisoner's Defence, tending to clear up the Matter in Difference, and the Court must have heard them or him; And this as a Stander-by, or <HI>Amicus Curiae,</HI> so saith <HI>Cook.</HI></P>

<P>The Law is built upon Right Reason, or Right Reason is the Law; and whatever is contrary to right Reason, is contrary to Law; the Reason of the Law being the Law it self.

<P><HI>Will you speak to the Indictment, and then you may plead? If you will not answer</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty, <HI>we will record it, and Judgment shall go against you.</HI> Clerk, <HI>enter him.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Recorder.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>if you will answer, you may plead for your self, or will you take the Oath? The Court takes no Notice how you came hither; What say you? Will you answer? For a Man may be brought out of</HI> Smithfield <HI>by Head and Shoulders, and the Oath tendered to him, and may be committed, without taking Notice how he came here.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>That kind of Proceeding is not only unjust but unreasonable also— <STAGE>[Here was some Interruption]</STAGE> and against the Laws aforesaid, which say, <HI>No Man shall be taken or imprisoned, but by Warrant, or due Pro∣cess of Law:</HI> So that this Speech of the Recorder's savours more of Passion than Justice; and Cruelty, than due Observance of Law; for every forcible Restraint of a Man's Liberty, is an Imprisonment in Law. Besides, this kind of Practice, to take Men by Force, and imprison them, and then ask them Questions, the answering of which makes them Guilty, is not only unrighteous in it self, but against Law, and makes one evil Act the Ground of another; and one Injury offered to one, the Foun∣dation of another; and this is my Case this Day.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>You must not be your own Judge; we are your Judges; but for our Parts we will not wrong you: Will you answer</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty? <HI>If not, you will run your self into a</HI> Premunire <HI>unavoidably, and then you know what I told you, would follow, for we take no Notice how you came hi∣ther, but finding you here, we tender you the Oath.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it seems You make the Law a Trapan to ensnare me, or as a Nose of Wax, or what you please: Well! I shall leave my Cause with the Lord God, who will plead for me in Righteousness. But sup∣pose I do take the Oath [now] at this Time, you may call me again <HI>[to-morrow.]</HI> and make a new Tender; or others may call me before them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, if there be new Matter; or if there fall out any emergent Occasion, whereby you may minister on your Part new Occasion: Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>will you swear?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I do take it to Day, it may be tender'd me again to-morrow, and so next Day, <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> whereby a great Part of my Time may be spent and taken up in taking the Oath, and swearing.</P>

<P><HI>When you have [once] sworn, you may not be put upon it again, except you minister Occasion on your Part.</HI></P>

<SP>

<P>Is this the Judgment of the Court, that the Oath [once] taken by me is sufficient, and ought not to be tender'd a Second Time, with∣out new Matter ministred on my Part?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, you making it appear you have [once] taken it.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Yes, it is the Judgment of the Court.</HI> To which they all stand∣ing up, said, <HI>Yes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then it seems there must be some new Occasion ministred by me after I have [once] taken it, or it ought not to be tendred to me the second Time.</P>

<P><HI>Yes.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then by the Judgment of this Court, if I make it appear that I have taken the Oath [once] and I have ministred no new Matter on my Part, whereby I can be justly charged with the Breach of it, then it ought not to be tendred me the second Time: But I am the Man that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it [once] being a Freeman of the City of <HI>London,</HI> when I was made free; witness the Records in <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> which I may produce, and no new Matter appearing to you on my Part; if there do, let me know it; if not, you ought not, by your own Judgment, to tender me it the second Time; for, <HI>De non apparentibus, &amp; non existentibus eadem Ra∣tio est.</HI>—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>you are mistaken, you must not think to surprize the Court with Criticisms, nor draw false Conclusions from our Judgments.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this he not a natural Conclusion from the Judgment of the Court, let right Reason judge; and if you recede from your own Judgments in the same Breath (as it were) given even now, what Justice can I expect from you? For, if you will not be just to your selves, and your own Judgments, how can I expect you should be just to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>If you have taken it, if there be a new Emergency, you are to take it again; as for Instance, The King hath been out of</HI> England, <HI>and now is come in again, there be many have taken it twenty, thirty, or forty Years since, yet this new Emergency requires it again; and altho' you have taken it, yet you must not make it appear before you answer</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty; <HI>therefore do not wrong your self, and prejudice your self and Family: Do you think that every Fellow that comes hither shall argue as you do? We have no more to do, but to know of you, whether you will answer</HI> (Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guil∣ty) <HI>or take the Oath, and then you shall be freed from the Indictment; if you will not plead,</HI> Clerk, <HI>record, it: What say you? Are you</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you not stand to your own Judgments? Did you not say even now, <Q>That if I had [once] taken the Oath, it ought not to be tendered to me the Second Time, except I administred new Matter on my Part that I have not kept it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> but no such Matter appearing, you ought not to tender it to me the second Time, by your own Confession, much less to indict me for Refusal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>If you will not plead, we will record it, and Judgment shall be given against you, therefore say,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty, <HI>or else we will record it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[The Clerk beginning to record it.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I answer, I demand a Copy of my Indictment; for I have heard it affirm'd by Council learned in the Law, <HI>That if I plead be∣fore I have a Copy, or have made my Exceptions, my Exceptions afterwards a∣gainst the Indictment will be made void:</HI> Therefore I desire a Copy of the Indictment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He that said so, deserves not the Name of a Council, for the Law is, You must first answer, and then you shall have a Copy. Will you plead,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my pleading <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> will not deprive me of the Benefit of quashing the Indictment for Insufficiency, or other Ex∣ceptions that I may make against it, I shall speak to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No it will not. Will you answer,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty? <HI>If you plead not, the Indictment will be found against you; Will you, answer? We will stay no longer.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am upon the Point: Will not my Pleading deprive me of the Benefit of the Law? For I am tender in that Respect, because it is not my own Case [only] but may be the Case of [Thousands] more; there∣fore I would do nothing that might prejudice others, or my self, as a Christian, or as an <HI>Englishman.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ʋnderstand your self, (but we will not make a Bargain with you,</HI> said another Judge) <HI>you shall have the Right done you as an</HI> Englishman, <HI>the Way is to answer,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty: <HI>If you plead, and find the Indictment not good, you may have your Remedy: Answer,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Indictment, it is very large, and seems to be confused, and made up of some Things true, and some Things false; my Answer therefore is, What is true in the Indictment I will not deny, because I make Conscience of what I say, and therefore, of what is true, I con∣fess my self <HI>Guilty,</HI> but what is false, I am <HI>Not Guilty</HI> of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>That is not sufficient; either answer</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not Guilty, <HI>or Judgment will be given against you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will speak the Truth, as before the Lord, as all along I have endeavoured to do: I am not guilty of that which is false, contained in the Indictment, which is the Substance thereof.</P>

<P><HI>No more ado, the Form is nothing,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must not wrong my Conscience, I am not guilty of what is false, as I said before; what is true, I am guilty of; what is not true, I am not guilty of that; which is the Substance thereof, as I said before.</P>

<P>The Seventh Day of the Week, called <HI>Saturday.</HI></P>
<P>Silence being made, <HI>John Crook</HI> was called to the Bar. The Clerk of the Sessions read something concerning the Jury, which was empannel∣led on purpose (as was said,) the Jury being discharged, who were Eye∣witnesses of what pass'd between us and the Court: And this Jury, be∣ing divers of them Soldiers, some of whom did by Violence and Force pull and hale Friends out of their Meetings, and some of us out of our Houses; and these were of the Jury by whom we were to be tried. The Clerk reading the Indictment (as I remember.)</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire to be heard a few Words, which are these, That we may have Liberty till the next Quarter-Sessions, to traverse the Indict∣ment, it being long, and in <HI>Latin,</HI> and like to be a Precedent: And I hope I need not press it, because I understood that you promised, (and especially the <HI>Recorder,</HI> who answered, when it was desired, <HI>you shall)</HI> that we should have Council also, the which we cannot be expected to have had the Benefit of, as yet, the Time being so short, and we kept Prisoners, that we could not go forth to advise with Council, neither could we tell how to get them to us; we having no Copy of the In∣dictment before this Morning; and because so suddenly hurried down to the Sessions, we cannot reasonably be supposed to be provided (as to Matter of Law) to make our Defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>We have given you Time enough, and you shall have no more; for we well try you at this Time, therefore swear the Jury.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire we may have Justice, and that we may not be surprized in our Trial, but that we may have Time till the next Quarter-Sessions, our Indictment being in <HI>Latin,</HI> and so large as it is; and this is but that which is reasonable, and is the Practice of other Courts: For, if it be but an Action above forty Shillings, it is not ordinarily ended under two or three Terms. And in the Quarter-Sessions, if one be indicted for a Trespass, if it be but to the Value of five Shillings, he shall have Li∣berty to enter his Traverse, and, upon Security given to prosecute, he
<PB N="356" REF="003104_0367_0FEFF6C22BEACC40"/>
shall have Liberty till the next Sessions, which is the ordinary Prac∣tice, which Liberty we desire, and we hope it is so reasonable, it will not be denied, especially upon this Occasion, we being like to be made a Precedent: And Courts of Justice have used to be especially careful in making of Precedents; for we are not provided, according to Law, to make our Defence at this Time, and therefore if we be put upon it, it will be a Surprizal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>There is no great Matter of Law in the Case, it is only Matter of Fact, Whether you have refused to take the Oath or not, that is the Point in Issue: And what Law can arise here?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Recorder.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Crook, <HI>The Keeper of the Prison was spoken to, to tell you, that we intended to try you this Day, and therefore ordered him, that Council might come to you, if you would; and also, that the Clerk should give you a Copy of the Indictment: This is fair; therefore we will go on to swear the Jury; for the Matter is, Whether you refuse the Oath, or not? And that is the single Point, and there needs neither Law nor Council in the Case; and therefore we considered of it last Night, when we sent you Word, and did determine to try you; and there∣fore it is in vain to say any Thing, for the Court is resolved to try you now; there∣fore swear the Jury, Cryer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will not surprize us: Then the other Prisoners (who also were indicted) cryed out (having spoken something before) <HI>Let us have Justice, and let not the Jury be sworn till we be first heard.</HI> So there was a great Noise, the Court being in a Confusion, some crying, <HI>Take them away;</HI> others, <HI>Stay, let them alone;</HI> others saying, <HI>Go on to swear the Jury:</HI> Which the Cryer in this Uproar and Confusion did do something, as if he had done it: Then we all cryed out for Justice and Liberty till the next Sessions; the Court being in a Confusion, some crying one Thing, and some another, which now cannot be called to Mind, by Reason of the great Distraction that was in the Court; neither what we said to them, nor they to us, the Noise was so great, and the Commands of the Court so various to the Officers, some commanding them to take us away; others, to let us alone; others, to bring us nearer; others cried, Put them into the Bail-dock; others, to put them within the farthest Bar, where the Felons used to stand; where we were forced in∣to accordingly: And in this Hurliburly and Confusion that was among them, some Men were sworn, to testify that we refused to take the Oath, which we never positively did; other Officers of the Court, whom they would have sworn, refused to swear, tho' press'd to it by the Chief Ju∣stice, they desired to be excused. Then spake one of the Prisoners again pretty much, but could hardly be understood, by Reason of the Noise in the Court; but the People, to whom he spoke with a loud Voice, by Way of Exhortation, might hear the Substance of what he said, which cannot now particularly be called to Mind; but it was to ex∣press the Presence and Love of God to himself, and to exhort others to mind his Fear, that they also might be acquainted with God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Stop his Mouth,</HI> Executioner. Which was accordingly done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prisoners.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we cried out, Will you not give us leave to speak for our selves; We except against some of the Jury, as being our Enemies, and some of them who by Force commanded us to be pulled out of our Meetings, contrary to Law, and carried us to Prison without Warrant, or other Process of Law; and shall these be our Judges? We except a∣gainst them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>It is too late now, you should have done it before they had been sworn Jurymen. Jury, go together, that which you have to find, is whether they have refused to take the Oath, or no, which have been sworn before you, that they did refuse, You need not go from the Bar.</HI> And like Words said the Recorder,
<PB N="357" REF="003104_0368_0FEFF67D262F9E98"/>
and others, there being a Confusion and Noise in the Court, many speaking together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prisoners.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we cried for Justice, and that we might be heard, to make our Defence, before the Jury gave their Verdict; but the Judge and Recorder said, we should not be heard, (making good by their Practice, what the Chief Judge had said the Day before, viz. <HI>That if we had Li∣berty to speak, we would make our selves famous, and them odious)</HI> crying again. <HI>Stop their Mouths,</HI> Executioner; which was done accordingly, with a dirty Cloth, and also endeavour'd to have gagg'd me,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">J. C.</NOTE> striving to get hold of my Tongue, having a Gag ready in his Hand for that Purpose; and so we were served several Times. Then I called out with a loud Voice, <HI>Will you condemn us without hearing? This is to deal worse with us, than</HI> Pilate <HI>did with Christ, who, tho' he condemned him with∣out a Cause, yet not without hearing him speak for himself; but you deny us both.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Let Mr.</HI> Gray <HI>come to the Bar.</HI> Room being made, he was con∣vey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to an Officer in the inner Bar, where he spake to the Court to this Purpose: I desire to know whether, according to Law, and the Practice of this Court, my self, and my Fellow-Prisoners, may have Liberty to put in Bail, to prosecute our Traverse at the next Sessions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, we will try you presently.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Stop their Mouths, Executioner:</HI> And this was the Cry of ma∣ny upon the Bench, they being still in a continued Confusion; some crying to the Jury, <HI>Give in your Verdict, for we will not hear them;</HI> with other Words, which could not be heard for the Noise, the Court be∣ing in Confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You might as well have caused us to have been murdered be∣fore we came hither, as to bring us hither under Pretence to <HI>try us,</HI> and not give us Leave to make our Defence; you had as good take away our Lives at the Bar, as to command us thus to be abused, and to have our Mouths stop'd: Was ever the like known? Let the righteous God judge between us. Will you hear me? You have often promised that you would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hear me, and we will hear you:</HI> Then he began to speak, and some others of the Bench interrupted him; sometimes they speaking two or three at a Time, and a Noise amongst the Officers of the Court: But the Judge said, <HI>We may give you Liberty till the next Sessions, but we may chuse; and therefore we will try you now.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I bad the People take Notice of <HI>their</HI> Promise, <HI>That I should have Liberty to speak,</HI> saying, See now you be as good as your Words.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember what the Judge said even now, <HI>That the Law of</HI> Eng∣land <HI>was a MERCIFƲL Law;</HI> that the Court had said before, <HI>They might, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey would, give us Liberty till the next Sessions, but they would not;</HI> and the Maxim of the Law also is, <HI>Summum j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, est summa injuria;</HI> there∣fore I hope your Practice will make it good, that it is a <HI>merciful Law;</HI> and not to execute <HI>Summum jus,</HI> &amp;c. upon me, and thereby condemn your selves out of your own Mouths.</P>

<P><HI>Jury, give in your Verdict.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me have Liberty first to speak; it is but few Words, and I hope I shall do it with what Brevity and Pertinency my Understand∣ing will give me Leave, and the Occasion requires; it is to the Point in these two Heads, viz. <HI>Matter of Law,</HI> and <HI>Matter of Conscience:</HI> To <HI>Matter of Law,</HI> I have this to say, First, as to the Statute it self, it was made against the <HI>Papists,</HI> occasion'd by the <HI>Gun-powder-Plot,</HI> and is enti∣tituled, <HI>For the better Discovery and suppressing of Popish Recusants:</HI> But
<PB N="358" REF="003104_0369_0FEFF6C49AC25F50"/>
they have Liberty, and we are destroy'd, what in you lies.)— <STAGE>(Inter∣rupted by the Judges, and Disturbance of the Court,)</STAGE> <HI>As to Conscience,</HI> I have something to say, and that is, It is a <HI>tender Thing,</HI> and we have known what it is to offend it; and therefore we dare not break Christ's Commands, who hath said, <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear not at all;</HI> and the Apostle <HI>James</HI> said, <HI>Above all Things, my Brethren, swear not.</HI>— <STAGE>(Interrupted)</STAGE> The Court cal∣ling again to the Executioner to <HI>stop my Mouth;</HI> which he did accor∣dingly, with his dirty Cloth, as aforesaid, and his Gag in his Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hear the Jury;</HI> who said something to him, which was sup∣posed to give in the Verdict, according to his Order; for they were fit for his Purpose, as it seems, they beginning to lay their Heads toge∣ther, before we had spoke any thing to them, only upon his Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Cryer, make Silence in the Court:</HI> Then the Recorder, taking a Paper into his Hand, read to this Purpose, viz. <HI>The Jury for the King do find, that</HI> John Crook, John Bolton, <HI>and</HI> Isaac Gray, <HI>are guilty of refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance; for which you do incur a</HI> Premunire, <HI>which is the Forfeiture of all your real Estates during Life, and your personal Estates for ever; and you to be out of the King's Protection, and to be imprisoned during his Pleasure: And this is your Sentence.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we are still under God's Protection.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the Prisoners were remanded to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where <HI>J. Crook</HI> found Opportunity to make a Narrative of the whole Trial which was printed as aforesaid, together with the <HI>Latin</HI> Indictment, in which he shewed several Errors, either by wrong Expressions, or by Omissions. Thus the Injustice of these arbitrary Proceedings were exposed to publick View, when this Trial appeared in Print; that the King himself might see thereby, how ill his Subjects were treated. But at that Time there were so many among the great Ones and Bishops, who were inclined to promote the Extirpation of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that there seemed no humane Help. <HI>J. Crook,</HI> shewed also circumstantially, how in many Cases of the Trial, they had acted against Law; for he himself having formerly been a Justice, knew well enough now an after what Manner Justice ought to be administred and maintained. How long he continued Prisoner, I can't tell. But by this Trial alone the Reader may see, how the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> so called, were treated in Regard of the Oath: And such Kind of Proceeding was the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of many of them, because the Intent of those in Authority seemed to be to suppress them quite.</P>
<P>Now follows a Copy of the Indictment, with some Notes and Ob∣servations on the same; whereby it may appear, how false it is, and how easily it might have been quash'd for Insufficiency, had we been allowed Time, (which by Law they ought to have granted) and been suffered to have made our own Defence; but that they would not do but stop'd our Mouths, as before is said, by the Hands of the Exe∣cutioner, to prevent what otherwise (as the Judge said) might have come to pass, <HI>viz.</HI> by having Liberty to make our Defence, by that Means we should make our selves famous, and them odious.</P>

<P>By these and the like Treatments we see how the Persecutors en∣deavoured to root out the <HI>Quakers,</HI> if possible; for the effecting of which, Alderman <HI>Richard Brown</HI> did whatever he could, continually letting loose the Reins to his exorbitant Malice, without regarding whether that which he was bent against was really punishable, or not, whereof the following Instance may serve for an Evidence. A certain Mender of old Shoes who belonged to the Society of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> was desired by a labouring Man on a seventh Day of the Week late at Night, to mend a Pair of Shoes for him, that he might have them again in the Morning, because he had no other to wear. The Cobler, to accomodate the Man, sat up at Work till after Midnight; but the Shoes not being finished then, he went to Bed; and rising early in the Morning, went to his Work again, as privately as he could in his Chamber. But an envious Neighbour informed against him for working on a Sunday; whereupon he was had before the said <HI>R. Brown,</HI> who committed him to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> to be there kept to hard Labour. And he refusing to beat Hemp, as being fully perswaded that he had not deserved such a Punishment, was cruelly whipp'd, but he bore it with great Constancy, and not yeild∣ing, he was turned up among those of his Society, who were impri∣soned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here on a religious Account.</P>
<P>As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Case, which befel an honest Man, was to be pitied, so there happened about that Time something among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> which was facetious and ridiculous: For several of them being taken out of their religious Meetings, were confined in <HI>Newgate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Condition of Friends Confinement in <HI>Newgate.</HI></NOTE> where in the Night, they lodged in a large Room, having in the middle of it a great Pillar, to which they fastned their Hammocks, at the one End, and to the opposite Wall on the other, quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the Room, in three Stories high, one over another; so that they who lay in the upper and middle Rows, were fain to go to Bed first, being obliged to climb up to the higher, by getting into the lower: And under the lower Rank of Hammocks, by the Wall-side, were laid Beds upon the Floor. Such a Multitude of Bedding for so many Persons in one Room, could not but somewhat infect the Air, and cause an unhealthy Steam; so that some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew sick, and one of the Prisoners died. This caused some Bustle, and it was not without good Reason, that an ancient grave Citizen, having seen the Prisoners thus crouded up, said, <HI>This is enough to breed an In∣fection among them.</HI> And this having been told to Sir <HI>William Turner,</HI> one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> he came into <HI>Newgate,</HI> and bidding the Turnkey bring down the said Prisoners to him in the Press-yard, where he was, he ordered they should return to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> where they had been before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A shabby Fel∣low thrust in among them removed by Means of <HI>T. Elwood.</HI></NOTE> Now among these was a shabby Fellow, who, to get Victu∣als without working, had thrust himself among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> when they were taken at a Meeting, on Purpose to be sent to Prison, and to be maintained by them. This lazy Varlet was no small Burden to our Prisoners; for whenever any Victuals were brought in to them, either
<PB N="362" REF="003104_0373_0FEFF6CB13B4CCC0"/>
for their Money, or sent to them by their Friends, he did not stick to thrust in with his Knife in Hand, and make himself his own Carver; and such was his Impudence, that if he saw the Provision was short, he would be sure to take enough, tho' others wanted. But how burthen∣some soever this lazy Drone was to the Prisoners, they could get no Relief; for to whom should they complain? Since the Keepers as well as others were for vexing and oppressing them. But now at length an Opportunity was come to be rid of his troublesome Company. Among the Prisoners, was <HI>Thomas Elwood,</HI> a Man of Literature, and of an acute Wit, with whom, long after, I entered into a familiar, and plea∣sing Correspondence by Letters. The said <HI>Elwood,</HI> when he had heard that they were to be sent to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> drew near to the Sheriff, and point∣ing to the aforesaid Fellow, said, <HI>That Man is not only none of our Compa∣ny, but an idle dissolute Fellow, who hath thrust himself among our Friends, that he might live upon them; therefore I desire we may not be troubled with him at</HI> Bridewel. The Sheriff smiling, and seeing this Fellow standing with his Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and looking as demurely as he could, that the Sheriff might take him for a <HI>Quaker,</HI> called him forth, and said to him, <HI>How came you to be in Prison?</HI> I was taken at a Meeting, said he. <HI>But what Busi∣ness had you there,</HI> said the Sheriff? <HI>I went to hear,</HI> returned the Fellow. <HI>Ay, you went upon a worse Design, it seems,</HI> replied the Sheriff; <HI>but I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll dis∣appoint you,</HI> continued he; <HI>for I will change your Company; and send you to them that are like your self.</HI> Then calling for the Turnkey, he said, <HI>Take this Fellow, and put him among the Felons; and be sure let him not trouble the</HI> Quakers <HI>any more.</HI> The Fellow not a little astonished at the hearing of this Doom, on a sudden parted with his Quakership; for off went his Hat, and falling to bowing and scraping, he said to the Sheriff, <HI>Good your Worship, have Pity upon me, and set me at Liberty.</HI> No, No, said the Sheriff, <HI>I will not so far disappoint you: Since you had a Mind to be in Pri∣son, in Prison you shall be for me.</HI> Then bidding the Turnkey once more to take him away, he had him up, and put him among the Felons. After this Manner this pretended <HI>Quaker</HI> was rewarded according to his Deeds;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Hubber∣thorn</HI> taken at a Meeting, abused by <HI>R. Brown,</HI> and sent to <HI>New∣gate.</HI></NOTE> and so the true <HI>Quakers</HI> got rid of him Breaking off now this jo∣cose and diverting, tho' true Narrative, I return to a serious Relation of the Sufferings of the faithful, which caused the Death of some of them; among these was <HI>Richard Hubberthorn,</HI> who some Time before, as hath been related, had a Conference with the King, who then pro∣mised him, that he and his Friends should not suffer for their Opi∣nions or Religion. But now he was in the Month called <HI>June,</HI> violent∣ly haled from the Meeting bearing the Name of the <HI>Bull and Mouth,</HI> and brought before Alderman <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> who with his own Hands pul∣led down his Hat upon his Head, with such Violence, that he brought his Head near to the Ground, and then committed him to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where being throng'd among others, he soon grew sick; and his Sick∣ness so increased, that he had hardly been two Months in Prison, be∣fore he was taken away by Death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And dies there.</NOTE> Two Days before his Departure, being visited by some of his Friends, who asked him if any Thing was upon his Spirits, he said, <HI>That there was no need to dispute Matters, for he knew the Ground of his Salvation, and was satisfied for ever in his Peace with the Lord.</HI> He also said, <HI>That Faith which hath wrought my Salvation, I well know, and have grounded Satisfaction in it.</HI> In the Morning before he deceased, one <HI>Sarah Blackberry</HI> was with him, to whom he said, <HI>Do not seek to hold me, for it is too strait for me, and out of this Straitness I must go; for I am wound into Largeness, and am to be lifted up on high, far above all.</HI> In this Frame of Mind he departed this Life, in the Evening, and so entered with Happiness into Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="003104_0374_0FEFF683A497A530"/>Now I come also to the glorious Exit of <HI>E. Burroughs,</HI> that valiant Hero,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Passages pre∣vious to the Death of <HI>E. Burroughs.</HI></NOTE> of whom Mention hath often been made in this History. For several Years he had been very much at <HI>London,</HI> and there preached the Gospel with piercing and powerful Declarations. And that City was so near to him, that oftentimes, when Persecution grew hot, he said to <HI>Francis Howgil</HI> his Bosom Friend, <HI>I can freely go to the City of</HI> London, <HI>and lay down my Life for a Testimony to that Truth, which I have declared thro' the Power and Spirit of God.</HI> And being in this Year at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and thereabouts, and moved to return to <HI>London,</HI> he said to many of his Friends, when he took his Leave of them, That <HI>he did not know he should see their Faces any more;</HI> and therefore he exhorted them <HI>to Faith∣fulne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Stedfastness in that wherein they had found Rest for their Souls.</HI> And to some he said, <HI>I am now going up to the City of</HI> London <HI>again, to lay down my Life for the Gospel, and suffer amongst Friends in that Place.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after, coming to <HI>London,</HI> and preaching in the Meeting-house called the <HI>Bull and Mouth,</HI> he was violently pull'd down by some Sol∣diers and had before Alderman <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> and committed to <HI>New∣gate.</HI> Several Weeks afterwards, being brought to the Sessions-house in the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> he was fined by the Court twenty Marks, and to lie in Prison till Payment. But judging this unreasonable in a high De∣gree, he could not bend thereto for Conscience-sake. He was kept there in Prison about eight Months, with six or seven Score Prisoners besides upon the same Account. But they being so crouded, that for want of Room their Natures were suffocated, many grew sick and died, of which Number he was one. And tho' a special Order from the King was sent to the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> for his and some other Prisoners Release, yet such was the Enmity of some of the City-Magi∣strates, especially <HI>Brown,</HI> that they did what was in their Power to prevent the Execution of the said Order. And thus <HI>E. Burroughs</HI> con∣tinued Prisoner, tho' his Sickness increased. During the Time of his Weakness he was very fervent in Prayer, as well for his Friends as for himself; and many consolatory and glorious Expressions proceeded from his Mouth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of his Expressions during his Weakness.</NOTE> Once he was heard to say, <HI>I have had the Testimony of the Lord's Love unto me from my Youth; and my Heart, O Lord, hath been given up to do thy Will. I have preached the Gospel freely in this City, and have often given up my Life for the Gospel's Sake; and now, O Lord, rip open my Heart, and see if it be not right before thee.</HI> Another Time he said, <HI>There is no Iniquity lies at my Door; but the Presence of the Lord is with me, and his Life I feel justifies me.</HI> Another Day he was thus heard in Prayer to God, <HI>Thou hast loved me when I was in the Womb; and I have loved thee from my Cradle; and from my Youth unto this Day; and have served thee faithfully in my Generation.</HI> And to his Friends that were about him, he said, <HI>Live in Love and Peace, and love one another.</HI> And at another Time, he said, <HI>The Lord taketh the Righteous from the Evil to come.</HI> And praying for his Ene∣mies and Persecutors, he said, <HI>Lord forgive</HI> Richard Brown, <HI>if he may be forgiven.</HI> And being sensible that Death was approaching, he said, <HI>Tho' this Body of Clay must turn to Dust, yet I have a Testimony that I have served God in my Generation; and that Spirit which hath lived and acted, and ruled in me, shall yet break forth in Thousands.</HI> The Morning before he departed this Life, (which was about the latter End of this Year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The 14th of the Month called <HI>Febr. 1662.</HI> His Death.</NOTE>) he said, <HI>Now my Soul and Spirit is centred into its own Being with God; and this Form of Person must return from whence it was taken.</HI> And after a little Season he gave up the Ghost. This was the Exit of <HI>E. Burroughs,</HI> who in his flourishing Years, <HI>viz.</HI> about the Age of eight and twenty, in an unmarried State, changed this mortal Life for an incorruptible, and whose youthful Summer-Flower was cut down in the Winter Season, after he had very zealously preached the Gospel about ten Years.</P>

In his Youth he surpassed other; of his Age in Knowledge, and tho' <HI>G. Croese,</HI> who writ the pretended History of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> calls him a <HI>Rustick Fellow,</HI> yet he was no more such than the said Author himself, who is a Country-Preacher: For he was well educated and instructed in that Learning which the Place of his Nativity, <HI>viz.</HI> the Barony of <HI>Kendal</HI> in <HI>Westmorland,</HI> afforded. Insomuch that tho' he was not skilful in Languages, yet he had the Tongue of the Learned; and in his pub∣lick Ministry was very fluent, and elegant in Speech, even according to the Judgment of learned Men.</P>
<P>His Enemies now began to rejoyce, for they seemed to imagine that the Progress of that Doctrine, which he so powerfully and successfully had preached, by his Decease would have been stopt or retarded: But they made a wrong Reckoning. <HI>Francis Howgil</HI> then gave forth a kind of <HI>Epicedium,</HI> which tho' in Prose, yet was not void of Poetical Ex∣pressions, and was as followeth:</P>
<P><Q>SHall Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. Howgil</HI>'s Testimony concerning him.</NOTE> or Months, or Years wear out thy Name, as tho' thou hadst no Being? Oh nay! Shall not thy noble and valiant Acts, and mighty Works which thou hast wrought thro' the Power of him that separated thee from the Womb, live in Generations to come? Oh yes! the Children that are yet unborn, shall have thee in their Mouths, and thy Works shall testify of thee in Generations, who yet have not a Being, and shall count thee blessed. Did thy Life go out as a Snuff of the Candle? Oh nay! Thou hast penetrated the Hearts of many, and the Memorial of the Just shall live for ever, and be had in Renown among the Children of Men for ever; for thou hast turned many to Righteousness, and shalt shine as a Star of God in the Firmament of God's Power, for ever and ever; and they that are in that, shall see thee there, and enjoy thee there, tho' thou be gone away hence, and can no more be seen in Mutability: yet thy Life and thy Spirit shall run parallel with Immortality. Oh <HI>Edward Bur∣roughs!</HI> I cannot but mourn for thee, yet not as one without Hope or Faith, knowing and having a perfect Testimony of thy Well-being in my Heart, by the Spirit of the Lord; yet thy Absence is great, and Years to come shall know the Want of thee. Shall I not lament as <HI>David</HI> did for a worse Man than thee, even for <HI>Abner,</HI> when in Wrath he perished by the Hand of <HI>Joab,</HI> without any just Cause, tho' he was a valiant Man? David <HI>lamented over</HI> Abner, <HI>and said, Died</HI> Abner <HI>as a Fool dieth?</HI> (Oh nay! he was betrayed of his Life,) Even so hast thou been bereaved of thy Life by the Hand of the Oppressor, whose Ha∣bitations are full of Cruelty. Oh my Soul, come not thou within their Secret, for thy Blood shall be required at the Hands of them who thirsted after thy Life; and it shall cry as <HI>Abel</HI>'s, who was in the Faith; even so wert thou, it shall weigh as a ponderous Milstone upon their Necks, and shall crush them under, and be as a Worm that gnaweth, and shall not die. When I think upon thee, I am melted into Tears of true Sorrow; and because of the Want that the Inheritance of the Lord hath of thee, my Substance is even as dis∣solved. Shall I not say as <HI>David</HI> did of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> when they were slain in Mount <HI>Gilboa, The Beauty of Israel is slain upon the high Places:</HI> Even so wast thou stifled, in nasty Holes, and Prisons, and many more, who were precious in the Eyes of the Lord: And sure∣ly precious wast thou to me, 0 dear <HI>Edward, I am distressed for thee

Well, thou art at Rest, and bound up in the Bundle of Life; and I know Tears were wiped away from thy Eyes, beca use there was no Cause of Sorrow in thee: For I know thou witnessed the old Things done away, and there was no Curse, but Blessings were poured upon thy Head as Rain, and Peace as a mighty Shower, and Trouble was far from thy Dwelling; tho' in the outward Man Trouble on every Side, and hath had a greater Share in that, for the Gospel-sake (tho' a Youth in thy Time) than many besides: But now thou art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reed from that, and hast obtained a Name thro' Faith, with the Saints in Light. Well, hadst thou more to give up than thy Life for the Name of Jesus in this World? Nay, and to seal thy Testimony committed unto thee with thy Blood, as thou hast often said in thy Day, which shall remain as a Crown upon thee for ever and ever. And now thou art freed from the Temptations of him who had the Power of Death, and art freed from thy outward Enemies, who hated thee because of the Love that dwelt in thee, and remaineth at the Right Hand of God, where there is Joy and Pleasure for evermore in the everlasting Light, which thou hast often testified unto, according to the Word of Prophecy in thy
<PB N="366" REF="003104_0377_0FEFF6CEF7890698"/>Heart, which was given unto thee by the Holy Ghost; and art at Rest in the Perfection thereof, in the Beauty of Holiness: Yet thy Life and thy Spirit I feel as present, and have Unity with it, and in it, beyond all created and visible Things, which are subject to Mutation and Change; and thy Life shall enter into others, to testify unto the same Truth, which is from everlasting to everlasting; for God hath raised, and will raise up Children unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> of them that have been as dead Stones, whose Power is Almighty, great in his People in the midst of their Enemies.</Q></P>
<P>With these sublime Expressions <HI>F. Howgil</HI> lamented his endeared Friend <HI>E. Burroughs.</HI></P>
<P>In the latter End of this Year <HI>William Ames</HI> also deceased at <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sickness and Death of <HI>W. Ames.</HI></NOTE> being come from <HI>England</HI> in a weak Condition, for he had suffer'd so much Hardship in <HI>Bridewel,</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> that his Health was much impaired when he came into <HI>Holland.</HI> In his Sickness, which was a lingring Disease, he was told, that among the <HI>Baptists</HI> and Collegians, it was said of him, that he had changed his Judgment, and was grieved for having judged them wrongfully. But to this he said, It was not so, but that he still judged their Way of Worship, especially their Dis∣putations and Will-worship, to be out of the Way of the Lord: And in this Belief he died in Peace.</P>
<P>In his Youth he was of a chearful Temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Something concerning his Convincement and Conver∣sion.</NOTE> and a Lover of such Com∣pany: But being in that Condition often disquieted in his Mind, he be∣came a closer Follower of the Priests and Teachers, and exercised him∣self diligently in reading the holy Scriptures, which, tho' good in it self, yet did not bring him to true Peace with God, tho' being or a quick Understanding, he could talk much out of them, insomuch, that en∣tering into Society with the <HI>Baptists,</HI> he became a Teacher among them. But tho' he was now more precise, and endeavoured to avoid the com∣mitting of Sins, yet he found that Root, from whence they sprang, re∣mained alive in him; for when he met with something that was con∣trary to his own Will or Mind, Anger soon prevailed: Neverthless in that State he would speak of Justification, Sanctification, and cleansing by the Blood of Christ, tho' he himself was not come to that pure Washing. In this State he perceived that he was no true Member of Christ, because Regeneration was still wanting. Thus he saw that a high Profession would not avail, and that something more was requi∣red to obtain a happy State: But as yet he knew not what it was that thus disquieted him, tho' sometimes on the committing of any Sin, he felt something that struck him with Terror. At length it pleased the Lord, that he hearing one of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, preach, That which convinceth Man of Sin, was the Light of Christ, which en∣lightens every Man coming into the World, this Doctrine entred so deep with him, that he embraced it as wholesome; and thus walking with great Circumspection and Fear before the Lord, he found that by giving diligent Heed to that which inwardly reproved and condemn∣ed him of Evil, he came to be delivered therefrom, and to witness Sanc∣tification. And thus advancing in Godliness, he himself became a zealous Preacher of that Doctrine, which had struck him so to the Heart. He was indeed a zealous Man, and tho' some were ready to think him too zealous, yet he was discreet, and I know that he was condescending in indifferent Matters, thinking that there were Customs, which tho' not followed in one Country, were yet tolerable in another. He was also generous, and left he might seem to be burdensome to any, he ra∣ther chose to work with his Hands.</P>

<P><HI>G.

But when he intended to de∣part with his Companion, he saw a Captain, and a Company of Soldiers, with Muskets and lighted Matches; and some of these coming to them, said <HI>They must come to their Captain.</HI> And when they were brought be∣fore him, he ask'd, <HI>Where was</HI> G. Fox? <HI>Which was he?</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> answered, <HI>I am the Man.</HI> The Captain being somewhat surprized, said, <HI>I will secure you among the Soldiers.</HI> Yet he carried himself civilly, and said, some Time after, <HI>You must go along with me to the Town.</HI> Where being come, he brought <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and <HI>T. Briggs,</HI> with some more of their Friends, to an Inn, which was the Jailor's House. And after a while, the Mayor of the Town, with the said Captain, and the Lieutenant, who were Justices, came and examined <HI>G. Fox,</HI> asking, <HI>Why he came thi∣ther to make a Disturbance? G. Fox</HI> told them, <HI>He did not come to make a Disturbance, neither had he made any there.</HI> They then said, <HI>There was a Law, which was against the</HI> Quakers <HI>Meetings, made only against them. G. Fox,</HI> told them, <HI>He knew no such Law.</HI> Then they produced the Act that was made against <HI>Quakers</HI> and others. <HI>G. Fox</HI> seeing it, told them, <HI>That Law was against such as were a Terror to the King's Subjects, and were Enemies, and held Principles dangerous to the Government; and therefore it was not against his Friends, for they held Truth, and their Principles were not dangerous to the Government, and their Meetings were peaceable, as was well known.</HI> Now it was not without good Reason that <HI>George</HI> said, he knew no such Law; since they had said, there was a Law made only against the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings; whereas the Act had the Appearance of being made against Plotters, and Enemies to the King, which certainly the <HI>Quakers</HI> were not. Yet it was said to <HI>G. Fox, He was an Enemy to the King.</HI> But this he denied, and told them, how he had once been cast into <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rby</HI> Dun∣geon, about the Time of <HI>Worcester</HI>-Fight, because he would not take up Arms against the King; and how afterwards he had been sent up to <HI>London,</HI> by Colonel <HI>Hacker,</HI> as a Plotter to bring in King <HI>Charles,</HI> and that he was kept Prisoner at <HI>London,</HI> till he was set at Liberty by <HI>Oliver Cromwel.</HI> They asked him then, <HI>Whether he had been imprisoned in the Time of the Insurrection?</HI> And he said <HI>Yes,</HI> but <HI>that he was released by the King's own Command.</HI> At length they demanded Bond for his Ap∣pearance at the Sessions, and would have had him <HI>promise to come thi∣ther no more.</HI> Bat he refused the one as well as the other.

all be set at Liberty.</HI> To which <HI>G.

<P>Coming into <HI>Cornwal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> comes into <HI>Cornwal</HI> where he re∣covers <HI>Geo. Bewly,</HI> who had been se∣duced with <HI>J. Hellen,</HI> by <HI>B. Pope,</HI> a <HI>Ran∣ter.</HI></NOTE> he found there one <HI>Joseph Hellen,</HI> and <HI>George Bew∣ly,</HI> who tho' they professed Truth, yet had suffered themselves to be seduc'd by <HI>Blanch Pope,</HI> a ranting Woman, who had ensnared them chief∣ly by asking, <HI>Who made the Devil, did not God?</HI> This silly Question, which <HI>Hellen</HI> and <HI>Bewly</HI> were at a Loss to answer, they propounded to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and he answered it with <HI>No: For,</HI> said he, <HI>all that God made was good, and was blest but so was not the Devil: He was called a Serpent, before he was called a Devil and an Adversary; and afterwards he was called a Dragon, be∣cause he was a Destroyer. The Devil abode not in the Truth, and by departing from the Truth he became a Devil. Now there is no Promise of God to the De∣vil, that ever he shall return into Truth again; but to Man and Woman, who have been deceived by him, the Promise of God is, that the Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head, and break his Power and Strength to Pieces.</HI> With this Answer <HI>G. Fox</HI> gave Satisfaction to his Friends; but <HI>Hellen</HI> was so poisoned, and run out, that they denyed him; but <HI>Bewly</HI> was recovered from his Fault by sincere Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> having performed his Service there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Has Service at <HI>Helstone</HI> near <HI>Fal∣mouth.</HI></NOTE> went to <HI>Helstone,</HI> near <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI> where he had a large Meeting, at which many were convinced, for he opened to the Auditory, <Q>The State of the Church in the pri∣mitive Times, and the State of the Church in the Wilderness, as also the State of the false Church that was got up since: Next he shewed that the everlasting Gospel was now preach'd again, over the Head of the Whore, Beast, Antichrist, and the false Prophets, which were got up since the Apostles Days; and that now the everlasting Gospel was received and receiving, which brought Life and Immortality to Light.</Q> And this Sermon was of such Effect, that the People generally confest, it was the everlasting Truth that had been declared there that Day.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> passing on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And at length comes to the Land's-End where <HI>N.

<P>Whilst he was in these Parts, there happened a very dismal and dread∣ful Case.</P>
<P>One Colonel <HI>Robinson</HI> was, since the King came in, made Justice of the Peace, and became a cruel Persecutor of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> of whom he sent many to Prison; and hearing that some Liberty was allowed them, by the Favour of the Jailor, to come home sometimes to visit their Wives and Children, he made Complaint thereof to the Judge at the Assizes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Judge <HI>Kneel∣ing</HI> fines a Jailor, on the Complaint of Col. <HI>Robinson</HI> for favouring Friends with some Liberty.</NOTE> against the Jailor, who thereupon was fined an hundred Marks, by Judge <HI>Keeling.</HI> Not long after the Assizes, <HI>Robinson</HI> sent to a neighbouring Justice, desiring he would go with him a Fanatick-hunt∣ing, (meaning the Disturbing of <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings.) On the Day that he intended thus to go a hunting, he sent his Man about with his Horses, and walked himself to a Tenement that he had, where his Cows and Dairy were kept, and where his Servants were then milking. Being come there, he asked for his Bull, and the Maids said, they had shut him into the Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dreadful Judgment that fell on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Robin∣son</HI> going a Fanatick-Hunting, as he call'd it.</NOTE> because he was unruly amongst the Kine. He then going into the Field, and having formerly accustomed himself to play with the Bull, he began to fence at him with his Staff, as he used to do; but the Bull snuffing, went a little back, and then ran fiercely at him, and then stuck his Horn into his Thigh, and lifting him upon his Horn, threw him over his Back, and tore up his Thigh to his Belly, and when he came to
<PB N="369" REF="003104_0380_0FEFF68AABA81620"/>
the Ground, he broke his Leg, and the Bull then gored him again with his Horns, and roared, and licked up his Blood. One of the Maid-servants hearing her Master cry out, came running into the Field, and took the Bull by the Horns to pull him off; but he, without hurting her, gent∣ly put her by with his Horns, and still fell to goring of him, and lick∣ing up his Blood. Then she ran and got some Workmen that were not far off, to come and rescue her Master; but they could not all beat off the Bull, till they had brought Mastiff Doggs to set on him; and then the Bull fled. His Sister having Notice of this Disaster, came and said, <HI>Alack Brother, what a heavy Judgment is this!</HI> And he answered, <HI>Ab Sister, it is a heavy Judgment indeed: Pray let the Bull be killed, and the Flesh given to the Poor.</HI> So he was taken up, and carried home, but so grievous∣ly wounded, that he died soon after; and the Bull was become so fierce that they were forced to kill him by shooting. This was the Issue of <HI>Ro∣binson</HI>'s mischievous Intent to go a Fanatick-hunting. I remember that in my Youth, I heard with Astonishment the Relation of this Accident from <HI>William Caton,</HI> who by a Letter from <HI>England,</HI> had received Intel∣ligence ot it; for the Thing was so remarkable, that the Tidings of it were soon spread afar off.</P>

And travelling towards <HI>Lan∣cashire,</HI> he came to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> where they told him, that Colonel <HI>Kirby</HI> had sent his Lieutenant thither to search for him, and that he had search∣ed Trunks and Chests. <HI>G, Fox</HI> having heard this, the next Day went to <HI>Kirby-Hall,</HI> where the said Colonel lived; and being come to him, he told him, <HI>I am come to visit thee, understanding that thou wouldst have seen me; and now I would fain know what thou hast to say to me, and whether thou hast any Thing against me.</HI> The Colonel, who did not expect such a Vi∣sit, and being then to go up to <HI>London</HI> to the Parliament, said before all the Company, <HI>As I am a Gentleman, I have nothing against you: But Mrs.</HI> Fell <HI>must not keep great Meetings at her House; for they meet contrary to the Act. G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>That Act does not take hold on us, but on such as meet to plot and contrive, and to raise Insurrections against the King; and we are none of those, but are a peaceable People.</HI> After some Words more, the Colo∣nel took <HI>G. Fox</HI> by the Hand, and said, <HI>He had nothing against him;</HI> and others said, <HI>He was a deserving Man.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>G. Fox</HI> parted, and returned to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> and shortly after he heard, there had been a private Meeting of the Justices and Deputy Lieutenants at <HI>Houlher-Hall,</HI> where Justice <HI>Preston</HI> lived, and that there they had issued a Warrant to apprehend him. Now he could have gone away, and got out of their Reach; but considering that there being a Noise of a Plot in the North, if he should go away they might fall upon his Friends; but if he staid, and was taken, his Friends might escape the better; he therefore gave up himself to be taken. Next Day an Officer came with his Sword and Pistols to take him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Justices have a pri∣vate Meet∣ing for his Apprehension, which be hears of, but will not with∣draw, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is taken.</NOTE> <HI>G.

G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>It was no Matter for that; it was sufficient that he heard of it.</HI> Then he asked him to shew his Order. But he laying his Hand on his Sword, said, <HI>You must go with me before the Lieutenants, to answer such Questions as they shall propound to you.</HI> Now tho' <HI>G.

yet the Officer would not; and then <HI>G.

Then they brought one <HI>Thomas Atkinson,</HI> one of his Friends, as a Witness against him, for some Words which he had told to one <HI>Knipe,</HI> who had informed against him; and these Words were, <HI>That he had written against the Plotters, and had knock'd them down:</HI> But from these Words little could be made. Then <HI>Preston</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Whether he had an Hand in the</HI> Battledoor? (being a Fo∣lio Book already mention'd) <HI>Yes,</HI> said <HI>G.

G.

Fox</HI> then striking his Hand on the Table, told him, <HI>I have suffered more than Twenty such as thou, or any that are here; for I have been cast into</HI> Darby-<HI>Dungeon for six Months together, and have suffered much be∣cause I would not take up Arms against this King, before</HI> Worcester-<HI>Fight: And I have been sent up Prisoner out of my own Country by Colonel</HI> Hacker <HI>to</HI> O. Cromwel, <HI>as a Plotter to bring in King</HI> Charles. <HI>Ye talk of the King, a Company of you; but where were ye in</HI> Oliver's <HI>Days: and what did ye do then for the King? But I have more Love to him, for his eternal Good and Welfare, than any of you have.</HI> Then they asked him, <HI>Whether he had heard of the Plot?</HI> And he said, <HI>Yes.</HI> Hereupon he was ask'd, <HI>How he had heard of it, and whom he knew in it?</HI> And he answered, <HI>He had heard of it thro' the High Sheriff of</HI> Yorkshire, <HI>who had told</HI> Dr. Hodgson, <HI>that there was a Plot in the</HI> North; <HI>but that he never heard any Thing of it in the</HI> South; <HI>and that he knew none of them that were in it.</HI> Then they ask'd him, <HI>Why would you write against it, if you did not know some that were in it. My Reason was,</HI> answered he, <HI>because ye are so forward to mash the Innocent and Guilty together; therefore I writ against it to clear the Truth from such Things, and to stop all forward foolish Spirits from running into such Things: And I sent Copies of it into</HI> Westmorland, Cumberland, Bishoprick, <HI>and</HI> Yorkshire, <HI>and to you here; and I sent also a Copy of it to the King and his Council; and it is like it may be in Print by this Time.</HI> Then said one of them, <HI>O, this Man hath great Power. Yes,</HI> said he, <HI>I have Power to write against Plotters. But,</HI> said one of them, <HI>You are against the Laws of the Land. Nay,</HI> said he, <HI>for I and my Friends direct all the People to the Spirit of God in them, to mor∣tify the Deeds of the Flesh: This brings them into Well-doing, and from that which the Magistrates Sword is against; which eases the Magistrates, who are for the Punishment of Evil-doers,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Middleton</HI> now weary, as it seem'd, of his speaking, cried, <HI>Bring the Book, and put the Oath of Allegiance and Su∣premacy to him.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> knowing him to be a <HI>Papist,</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Whether he, who was a Swearer, had taken the Oath of Supremacy?</HI> For this Oath tending to reject the Pope's Power in <HI>England,</HI> was a kind of Test to try People whether they were <HI>Papists,</HI> or no: <HI>But as for us,</HI> said <HI>G. Fox, we can∣not swear at all, because Christ and his Apostle have forbidden it.</HI> Now some of these that sat there, seeing <HI>Middleton</HI> was thus pinch'd, would not have had the Oath put to <HI>G. Fox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Oath a Snare to <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> as the Popish Sacra∣ment had been to Prote∣stants.</NOTE> but others would, because this was their last Snare, and they had no other Way to get him into Prison; for all other Things had been cleared: But this was like the <HI>Papists</HI> Sacra∣ment ot the Altar, by which they formerly ensnared the Martyrs:
<PB N="371" REF="003104_0382_0FEFF68EC1995CE0"/>
And in the low Countries they ask'd the <HI>Baptists, Whether they were re∣baptized?</HI> And if this appeared, then they said, <HI>We don't kill you, but the Emperor's Decree condemns you.</HI> So they tendered <HI>G. Fox</HI> the Oath, and he refusing to take it, they consulted together about sending him to Jail; but all not agreeing, he was only engaged to appear at the Ses∣sions; and so for that Time they dismiss'd him.</P>
<P>Then he went back with <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> where Colonel <HI>West</HI> who was at that Time a Justice of the Peace, came to see him. And <HI>G. Fox</HI> asking him, what he thought they would do with him at the Sessions, he said, <HI>They would tender the Oath to him again.</HI> The Time of the Sessions now approaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He appears at the Sessions and being re∣examined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at last com∣mitted for re∣fusing the Oath.</NOTE> <HI>G. Fox</HI> went to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and appeared according to his Engagement, where he found upon the Bench, Justice <HI>Flemming,</HI> who in <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> had offered five Pounds to any Man that would apprehend <HI>G. Fox.</HI> There were also the Justices <HI>Spencer</HI> and <HI>Rawlinson,</HI> and Colonel <HI>West.</HI> There was a great Concourse of People in Court, and when <HI>G. Fox</HI> came up to the Bar, and stood with his Hat on, they look'd earnestly upon him. Then Proclamation being made for all <HI>to keep Silence on Pain of Imprisonment,</HI> he said twice, <HI>Peace be among you.</HI> Then <HI>Rawlinson,</HI> who was Chairman, spoke, and asked, <HI>If he knew where he was?</HI> To which he answered, <HI>Yes, I do; but it may be my Hat of∣fends you: But that's a low Thing, that's not the Honour I give to Magistrates: For the true Honour is from from above; and I hope it is not the Hat which ye look upon to be the Honour.</HI> To which the Chairman said, <HI>We look for the Hat too. Whereupon do you shew your Respect to Magistrates, if you don't put off your Hat? G. Fox</HI> replied, <HI>In coming when they call me.</HI> They then bid one <HI>take off his Hat.</HI> After some Pause, the Chair-man asked him, <HI>Whether he knew of the Plot?</HI> To which he returned, <HI>That he had heard of it in</HI> Yorkshire <HI>by a Friend that had it of the High Sheriff.</HI> The next Question was, <HI>Whether he had declared it to the Magistrates?</HI> And his Answer was, <HI>I have sent Papers abroad against Plots and Plotters, and al∣so to you, as soon as I came into the Country, to take all Jealousies out of your Minds concerning me and my Friends: For it was and is our Principle to declare against such Things.</HI> Then they asked him, <HI>If he knew not of an Act against Meetings?</HI> To which he made Answer, <HI>That he knew there was an Act that took hold of such as met to the terrifying of the King's Subjects, and were Ene∣mies to the King, and held dangerous Principles. But I hope, said he, ye do not look upon us to be such Men for our Meetings are not to terrify the King's Subjects, neither are we Enemies to him, or any Man.</HI> That which followed hereupon, was the tendring of the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy to him. To which he told them, <HI>That he had never taken any Oath in his Life; and that he could not take any Oath at all, because Christ and his Apo∣stle had forbidden it.</HI> Then <HI>Rawlinson,</HI> who was a Lawyer, asked him, <HI>Whether he held it was unlawful to swear?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Insnaring Question.</NOTE> G. Fox presently perceived this Question to be put on Purpose to ensnare him; for by a certain Act 13 and 14 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. Cap. 1. such who said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 <HI>and</HI> 14 Car. 2. Cap. 1.</NOTE> <HI>It was unlawful to swear,</HI> were liable to Banishment, or to a great Fine. Therefore to avoid this Snare, he told them, <HI>That in the Time of the Law amongst the</HI> Jews, <HI>before Christ came, the Law commanded them to swear; but Christ who did fulfil the Law in the Gospel Time, commands,</HI> not to swear at all; <HI>and the Apostle</HI> James <HI>forbids swearing, even to them that were</HI> Jews, <HI>and had the Law of God.</HI> Now after much other Discourse, the Jailor was called, and <HI>G. Fox</HI> committed to Prison. He then having the Paper about him which he had written against Plots, desired it might be read in the Court: But this they would not suffer. Being thus committed for refusing to swear, he said to those on the Bench and all the People, <HI>Take Notice that I suffer for the Doctrine of Christ, and for my Obedience to his Command.</HI> After∣wards he understood, the Justices said, that they had private Instructi∣ons
<PB N="372" REF="003104_0383_0FEFF6D882A56228"/>
from Colonel <HI>Kirby</HI> to prosecute him, notwithstanding his fair Carriage, and seeming Kindness to him before.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>G. Fox</HI> in Prison, I am to say that the Act already mention∣ed, whereby a Penalty was laid on all such who should say, <HI>It was not unlawful to take an Oath,</HI> was that which extended to Banishment, being made not long before, and expresly levelled against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as plainly appeared by the Title.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the same before printed at large.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is that Act, by Direction whereof the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, were afterwards banished, as may be related in due Time and Place; and tho' the King himself was pretty good-natur'd, yet he suffered himself to be so swayed by the Instigations of some envious Men, as well among the Ecclesiasticks as among the Laity, that he gave the Royal Assent thereto.</P>
<P>Whilst <HI>G. Fox</HI> was Prisoner at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> many of his Friends were al∣so imprisoned, for frequenting Religious Meetings, refusing to take Oaths, and for not paying Tythes to the Priests: But since he was not brought to his Trial till next Year, we will leave him still in Jail, and in the mean while take a Turn to <HI>Colchester,</HI> where Persecution now was exceeding fierce.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel and bloody Perse∣cution at <HI>Col∣chester, W. More</HI> Mayor.</NOTE> <HI>William More</HI> Mayor of that Town, came on a First Day of the Week, and broke up the Meeting of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, and committed some of them to Prison; the next Week he did so again; and a Week after he caused a Party of the County-Troop to come to the Meeting. These beat some, and did much Mischief to the Forms, Seats, and Windows of the Meeting-place. And afterward the Mayor employed an old Man to stop People from going in at the Gate to the Meeting-Room; who told those that would have entered, that the Mayor had set him there to keep them out. Now tho' they knew he was no Officer, nor had any Warrant, yet they made no Resi∣stance, but continuing in the Street, thus kept their Meeting in a peace∣able Manner, being not free for Conscience-sake to leave off their pub∣lick Worship of God, tho' in that Time of the Year it was cold, and often wet Weather; and thus it continued many Weeks, tho' attended with so much Difficulty.</P>
<P>In the Forepart or <HI>December,</HI> there came about forty or the King's Troopers, on Horseback, in their Armour, with Swords, Carbines and Pistols, crying, <HI>What a Devil do ye here?</HI> And falling violently upon this harmless Company, they beat them, some with Swords, and others with Carbines, without Distinction of Male or Female, old or young, until many were much bruised, chasing them to and fro in the Streets. The next First-day of the Week, these furious Fellows came again, having now got Clubs, wherewith, as well as with Swords and Carbines, they most grievously beat those that were peaceably met together in the Street to worship God. This cruel Beating was so excessive, that some got above an hundred Blows, and were beaten so black and blue, that their Limbs lost their natural Strength: One there was whom a Trooper beat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o long, till the Blade of his Sword fell out of the Hilt, which he that was thus beaten seeing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka∣ble Instance.</NOTE> said to the other, <HI>I will give it thee up again,</HI> which he did, with these Words, <HI>I desire the Lord may not lay this Day's Work to thy Charge.</HI></P>
<P>But to avoid Prolixity, I shall not mention all the particular Misu∣sages which I find to have been committed there. These cruel Doings continued yet several Weeks, and some were beaten so violently, that their Blood was shed in the Streets, and they sunk down, and fainted away.<NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Graunt <HI>killed.</HI></NOTE> One <HI>Edward Graunt,</HI> a Man of about threescore and ten Years of Age, (whose Wife and Daughters I was well acquainted with) was so terribly knock'd down, that he outliv'd it but a few Days. So hot was this Time now, that these Religious Worshippers, when they went to
<PB N="373" REF="003104_0384_0FEFF69105CCBDC0"/>
their Meeting, seemed to go to meet Death; for they could not pro∣mise to themselves to return Home either whole or alive. But notwith∣standing all this, their Zeal for their Worship was so lively, that they durst not stay at Home, tho' humane Reasoning might have advised them thereto. And some of them had been People of Note in the World, among others one <HI>Giles Barnardiston,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Barnar∣diston</HI> educa∣ted at the U∣niversity, and afterwards made a Colo∣nel; convinced by <HI>G. Fox</HI> jun becomes a Mi∣nister, and Sufferer.</NOTE> who having spent six Years in the University, in the Study of human Literatur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, afterwards came to be a Colonel; but in Process of Time, having heard <HI>G. Fox</HI> the younger preach, he was so entirely convinced of the Truth by him declared, that laying down his military Command, he entred into the Society of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and continuing faithful, he in Time became a Mi∣nister of the Gospel among the said People; being a Man of a meek Spirit, and one whom I knew very well. This <HI>Barnardiston</HI> did not for∣bear frequenting Meetings, how hot soever the Persecution was, being fully given up to hazard his Life with his Friends.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. Fromantle</HI> a Merchant, barbarously beaten; his Wife greatly endangers her own Person to save her Hus∣band's.</NOTE> One <HI>Solomon Fro∣mantle,</HI> a Merchant, with whom I was well acquainted, was so grievous∣ly beaten, that he fell down, and lost much of his Blood in the Street; and yet the barbarous Troopers did not leave off beating him: His Wife, a Daughter of the aforesaid <HI>Edward Graunt,</HI> fearing lest he should be kill'd, fell down upon him, to cover and protect him from the Blows with the Hazard of her own Body, as she herself told me in the Pre∣sence of her said Husband; a conjugal Love and Fidelity well worthy to be mentioned, and left upon Record. And tho' she then did not re∣ceive very fierce Blows, yet there were some Women whose Lot it was to be sorely beaten with Clubs, whereinto Iron Spikes were driven, as among the rest an aged Widow, who received no less than twelve such bloody Blows on several Parts of her Body; and another Woman was pierced in her Loins with such a spiked Club. An ancient Man of sixty-five Years was followed a great Way by three on Foot, and one on Horseback, and so beaten and bruised, that a Woman, pitying this old Man, spoke to these mischievous Fellows to leave off; but this so incensed him that was on Horseback, that he gave her a hard Blow with his Sword on the Shoulder, with cursing and railing. This Barba∣rity continued, till the Persecutors seemed to be more wearied out than the Persecuted, who seemed to grow valiant in these sore Tribulations, how grievous soever. A great Promoter of this furious Violence was Captain <HI>Turner,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt. <HI>Turner.</HI> a great Pro∣moter of these Violences.</NOTE> who drove on his Troopers to act this; nay, such was his Malice, that once at the breaking up of a Meeting, he not only gave Order to beat the People, but also to spoil the Doors, Windows, and Walls, so that the Damage came to five and twenty Pounds.</P>
<P>Now I could enter upon large Relation of the Trial of many Priso∣ners at <HI>Worcester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings at <HI>Worcester</HI> before the Judges <HI>Hide</HI> and <HI>Terril.</HI></NOTE> before the Judges <HI>Hide</HI> and <HI>Terril;</HI> but since that Tri∣al was much after the same Manner as that of <HI>John Crook,</HI> here before∣mentioned at large, I'll but cursorily make some Mention of it. When the Prisoners being brought to the Bar, asked <HI>Why they had been kept so long in Prison?</HI> They were answered with the Question, <HI>Whether they would take the Oath of Allegiance?</HI> And Endeavours were used to draw some to betray themselves, by asking them, <HI>Where they had been on such a Day?</HI> For if they had said, <HI>At Meeting,</HI> then it would have appeared from their own Mouth that they had acted contrary to the Law; but they answered warily, <HI>That they were not bound to accuse themselves.</HI> Others by Evidence were charged with having been at a Meeting; and when they said, <Q>That their Meetings were not always for pub∣lick Worship, but that they had also Meetings to take Care for Widows, Fatherless, and others that were indigent, yet it was said to the Jury, that tho' there was no Evidence that there had been any Preaching in the Meeting, <HI>Yet if they did but believe that the Prisoners

had kept a Meeting for religious Worship, it was sufficient for them to approve the Indictment.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Ad∣vice to a Ju∣ry.</NOTE> And yet such Proceedings in other Cases would have been thought unwarrantable.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Bourn</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ned for hav∣ing been at a Meeting. His Question to the Judge answer'd rashly.</NOTE> One <HI>Edward Bourn</HI> being imprisoned for having been at a Meeting, and afterwards brought to his Trial, the Oath was tendered to him. Among other Words he spoke in Defence of himself, he said, <HI>Suppose Christ and his Apostles kept a Meeting here in this Time, would this Act against Conventicles also take hold of them? Yes,</HI> said the Judge, it would. But be∣thinking himself, he said, <HI>I won't answer your Questions. Ye are no Apo∣stles.</HI> The Conclusion was, that <HI>Bourn</HI> and several of his Friends were fined each of them five Pounds.</P>
<P>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w since those that were fined thus, did not use to pay the Fines, judging that the Thing which they were fined for was an indispensable Duty they owed to God, and therefore they could not pay any such Fine with a good Conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress made often for two or three times the Value.</NOTE> the Consequence therefore generally was Impri∣sonment, and Distraining of their Goods, whereby some lost twice, and it may be, thrice as much as the Fine amounted to. Some of the Prisoners made it appear, that they had been somewhere else, and not in the Meeting, at the House of one <HI>Robert Smith</HI> at such Time as the Evidence declared by Oath; yet because they gave no satisfactory An∣swer to the Question, <HI>Whether they had not been there on that Day?</HI> they were deemed guilty.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.

Whether not for Papists?</HI> And on Suspicion that some of that Perswasion sat on the Bench, he asked also, <HI>Whether they, for the Satisfaction of the People there present, ought not also to take the Oath?</HI> But the Judge waved this, telling him, <HI>He must take the Oath, or else Sentence should be pronounced against him. Smith</HI> asked then, <HI>Whether the Example of Christ should decide the Question?</HI> But the Judge said, <HI>I am not come here to dispute with you concerning the Doctrine of Christ, but to inform you con∣cerning the Doctrine of the Law.</HI> Then <HI>Smith</HI> was led away, and after∣wards, when an Indictment for his refusing the Oath was drawn up, he was brought into the Court again, and asked, <HI>Whether he would answer to the Indictment, or no?</HI> And the Reasons he gave, not being accepted, the Judge said, before <HI>Smith</HI> had done speaking, <HI>This is your Sentence, and the Judgment of the Court. You shall be shut out of the King's Protection, and for∣feit your personal Estate to the King for ever, and your real Estate during Life.</HI> To this <HI>Robert</HI> said with a composed Mind, <HI>The Lord hath given, and if he suffers it to be taken away, his Will be done.</HI> Thus <HI>Robert Smith</HI> suffered, with many more of his Friends, there and elsewhere, all which I b∣elieve my Life-time would not be sufficient to describe circumstantially.</P>
<P>Passing then by the other Persecutions of this Year, I'll relate one remarkable Case that happened in this Year 1663, where Patience tri∣umphed very eminently over Violence. But before I enter upon this Narrative, it won't be amiss to go back a little, and mention some sin∣gular Cases of the chief Actor of the Fact I am going to describe.</P>
<P>His Name was <HI>Thomas Lurting,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Relation of <HI>T. Lurting,</HI> who of a fight∣ing Sailor, became a peaceable Christian.</NOTE> who formerly had been Boatswain's Mate in a Man of War, and often had been preserved in imminent Dan∣gers, as once being at the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands, under Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> Command∣er: In this Expedition, they ruined the Admiral and Vice-Admiral of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Galleons; and this being done, he with seven Men was sent with a Pinnace to set three Galleons in the Bay on Fire; which Order he executed by setting one of them on Fire, which burnt the other two. But returning, and passing by a Breast-work, they received a Volley of small Shot, by which two Men, close to one of which <HI>Thomas</HI> sat, were killed, and a third was shot in his Back, but <HI>Thomas</HI>
<PB N="375" REF="003104_0386_0FEFF694471D1F08"/>
received no Harm. And going out of the Bay, they came within about four Ships Length of the Castle, which had forty Guns; and when they came directly over against the Castle, the Guns were fired, and a Shot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Bolt-rope a little above <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Head, without hurting him. In more Dangers he was eminently preserved, but that I may not be too prolix, I'll now relate, how from a fighting Sailor, he became a harm∣less Christian.</P>
<P>About the Year 1654, it happened that among the Soldiers which were in the Ship he was in, there was one that had been at a Meeting of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there were two young Men in the Ship who had some Converse with him; but he was soon taken away from the Ship. Yet these two young Men seemed to be under some Convincement; for about six Months after, they scrupled to go and hear the Priest, and to put off their Hats to the Captain; by which they came to be called <HI>Quakers.</HI> These two met often together in Silence, which being seen by others of the Ship, their Number increased; but this troubled the Captain exceedingly, and the Priest grew not a little angry, and said to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Boatswain, <HI>O</HI> Thomas, <HI>an honest Man and a good Christian; here is a dangerous People on Board,</HI> viz. the Quakers, a blasphe∣mous People, denying the Ordinances and Word of God. This made <HI>Thomas</HI> so furious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He beats the <HI>Quakers</HI> aboard.</NOTE> that in a bigotted Zeal he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to beating and abusing these Men, when religiously met together. But this was not the Way to have a quiet and sedate Mind; for the Remembrance of his former De∣liverances stuck so close upon him, that he could no more beat any of the said People; and then he came to a farther Sight, insomuch that he clearly saw what a Fellow the Priest was: For when <HI>Thomas</HI> could no longer abuse the said People, then he was not accounted by him either <HI>an honest Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is under Trouble of Mind.</NOTE> or a good Christian.</HI> Now being under Condemnation be∣cause of his Outgoings, he made many Promises to the Lord; but these being made in his own Will, were of little Effect. Yet by the Grace of God it was shewed him that since he did not perform these Pro∣mises, he could not be benefitted thereby, which caused to him much Trouble.</P>
<P>Among those in the Ship called <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Dennis</HI> has much In∣fluence upon him.</NOTE> was one <HI>Roger Dennis,</HI> whom be intirely loved, and therefore never struck him; for this Man had a Check on <HI>Thomas,</HI> to that Degree, that looking only upon him, he durst not touch any of those which he intended to have abused. In this State, feeling no Peace in his Mind, after some Time, he much de∣sired to be alone, the more freely to pour out his Heart before the Lord; and tho' he then felt himself inwardly condemned, yet Judg∣ments became pleasant to him, because thereby his Heart was tendered and broken; in which State he could not forbear sometimes to cry out, <HI>0 Lord!</HI> But this being observed by the Ship's Crew made some say, <HI>He was mad;</HI> and others, <HI>He was distracted;</HI> and of this some writ home to <HI>England.</HI> Now it fell to his Share to be mock'd and ridicul'd; but he endeavoured to be fully given up, if he might but have Peace in his Conscience with God.</P>
<P>And being one Evening alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is moved, but very a∣verse to join with the <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> he was very earnest with the Lord to know what People he should join himself to; and then it was plain∣ly shewed him, <HI>the Quakers.</HI> But this so startled him at that Time, that he desired of the Lord, rather to die than to live: For to join with a People whom he so often had been beating and abusing, seemed to be harder to him than Death it self; and by the Subtilty of Satan he was often assaulted by various Thoughts, to keep him off from the said People. But when the Lord made him mindful of his manifold Preservations and Deliverances, it mollified his Heart, so that at Length he came to this Resolution, <HI>Whether</HI> Quaker, <HI>or no</HI> Quaker, <HI>I am for
<PB N="376" REF="003104_0387_0FEFD55CDDE175B8"/>
Peace with God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet resolves to do it.</NOTE> Yet it cost him many a bitter Sigh, and many a sor∣rowful Tear, before he could come to a full Resignation. But the in∣ward Reproofs of the Lord, attended with Judgments, followed him so close, that he could no longer forbear, but gave up. And then he took Opportunity to discover his Heart to his Friend <HI>Roger Denis,</HI> who spoke so to the Purpose, that he had great Satisfaction. But not long after, Temptations assaulted him again in this Manner, <HI>What, to join thy self to such a foolish People?</HI> And the very Thoughts of this were so grievous to him, that he grew even weary of his Life; for thus to expose himself to Scorn, seem'd to him an intolerable Cross. But this Struggling was not the Way to get Peace with God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes to their Meet∣ing.</NOTE> The first Day of Week being come, he resolved to go to the small Meeting, who were now six in Number; but it being reported that he was among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> many of the Company left their Worship to see him; and they made a great Noise. When the Worship was over, the Captain asked the Reason of that Noise; and it was told him, that <HI>Thomas</HI> was amongst the <HI>Quakers;</HI> on which he sent for him, there being several Officers also present; but the first that spoke was the Priest, saying, Thomas, <HI>I took you for a very honest Man, and a good Christian, but am sor∣ry you should be so deluded.</HI> And the Captain endeavoured to prove from the Bible, the <HI>Quakers</HI> were no Christians. <HI>Thomas</HI> in the mean while was still and quiet; and the others seeing they could not prevail upon him that Way, took another Course, and said, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> some∣times came to him, saying, Do such and such a Thing, But because he knew this to be altogether false, and saw how they would bear him down with Lies, he was the more strengthened; so that going to his Friends, he said to them, <HI>When I went to the Captain, I was scarce half a</HI> Quaker; <HI>but by their Lies and false Reports, they have made me almost a whole</HI> Quaker; <HI>or at least I hope to be one.</HI></P>

Now there was none aboard that would abuse the <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' much try'd by the Captain; for he got some Men out of other Ships on Purpose to vex them: But how fiercely soever these behaved themselves, a higher Power limited them. At length there was a Sick∣ness in the Ship, which swept away above Forty in a short Time; and most of them called <HI>Quakers</HI> had the Distemper also, but none died of it, tho' some were brought very low: But they took great Care of one another when sick, and whatever one had, was free for all; which Care being seen by others, made some of them cry upon their Death-bed, <HI>O carry me to the</HI> Quakers, <HI>for they take great Care one of another, and they will take some Care of me also.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He becomes more friend∣ly.</NOTE> This Visitation in the Ship changed the Captain so much, that he was very kind to <HI>Thomas,</HI> and often sent him Part of what he had. <HI>Thomas</HI> seeing him in such a good Humour, desired of him to have the Cabin he lay in before his Change; which Request was granted, for none were willing to lie therein, because they told one another it was troubled with an evil Spirit, since three or four had died therein within a short Space of Time. This Cabin he made use of also for a Meeting-place; and the Captain was now so well pleas'd with him, that when something was to be done, he would often say, Thomas, <HI>Take thy Friends, and do such or such a Thing:</HI> For as yet they were not against fighting,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thomas</HI> and friends suc∣cessful in Ex∣peditions.</NOTE> and therefore no compleat <HI>Quakers.</HI> And thus when <HI>Thomas</HI> and his Friends were sent out on some Expedition, they did their Work beyond his Expectation. But tho' they were not brought off from Fighting, yet when with others they annoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their Enemies, they would take none of the Plunder, and in all desperate Attempts, they
<PB N="377" REF="003104_0388_0FEFF696EE65E630"/>
received no Hurt, tho' several others were kill'd and wounded; and they behaved themselves so valiantly, that their Captain would say to other Captain, That <HI>he cared not if all his Men were</HI> Quakers, <HI>for they were the har∣diest Men in his Ship.</HI> But tho' this was a Time of Liberty, yet <HI>Thomas</HI> lookt upon it as a Fore-runner of farther Exercise; for he saw what was done in pretended Friendship, was but to serve their own Ends; and therefore he expected a Time of Trial would come, and so it did.</P>
<P>For being come to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> they were order'd to go to <HI>Barcelona,</HI> to take or burn a <HI>Spanish</HI> Man of War. Their Station was to lie against a Castle, and batter it; which they did; and one Corner of the Castle playing some Shot into their Ship, <HI>Thomas</HI> was for beating down that Part: And those called <HI>Quakers</HI> fought with as much Courage as any, he himself being stript to his Wastcoat: And going into the Fore-castle, he levelled the Guns, but said, <HI>Fire not, till I go to see where the Shot lights, that we may level higher or lower;</HI> he being yet as great a Fighter as any:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He becomes a∣verse to fight∣ing.</NOTE> But as he was coming out of the Fore-Castle-Door, to see where the Shot fell, suddenly it run thro' him, <HI>What, if now thou kill'st a Man?</HI> This struck him as a Thunder-bolt, and he that can turn all Mens Hearts at his Pleasure, chang'd his in a Minute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Time to that Degree, that whereas just before he bent all his Strength to kill Men, he now found in himself no Will thereto, tho' it were to gain the World; for he pre∣sently perceived it was from the Lord; and then putting on his Clothes, he walked on the Deck, as if he had not seen a Gun fired: And being under great Exercise of Mind, some ask'd him, <HI>If he was hurt:</HI> And he answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>No; but under some Scruple of Conscience on the Account of Fight∣ing,</HI> tho' then he knew not that the <HI>Quakers</HI> refus'd to fight.</P>
<P>When Night came, they went out of the Reach of the Castle-shot; and he took Occasion to speak with two of his Friends in the Ship, and enquired their Judgment concerning Fighting; but they gave little Answer to it, but said however, <HI>If the Lord sent them well home, they would never go to it again.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They resolve against it.</NOTE> To which he returned, <HI>That if he stood honest to that of God in his own Conscience, and they came to it to-morrow, with the Lord's As∣sistance he would bear his Testimony against it;</HI> for he clearly saw, that for∣asmuch as they had been such great Actors in Fighting, they now must bear their Testimony against it, and wait what would be the Issue; say∣ing with themselves, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> The next Day they heard that several were killed on Shore, which grieved <HI>Thomas</HI> not a lit∣tle. Some Time after, one of <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Friends went to the Captain to be cleared; and he asking <HI>Why?</HI> His Answer was, That <HI>he could fight no longer.</HI> To which the Captain said, <HI>He that denies to fight in Time of En∣gagement, I will put my Sword in his Guts. Then,</HI> said the other, <HI>thou wilt be a Manslayer, and guilty of shedding Blood:</HI> For which the Captain (who was a <HI>Baptist</HI>-Preacher) beat him sorely with his Fist and Cane; and he that had been their Friend, was now become their open Enemy.</P>
<P>Some Time after (about the Year 1655,) being at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> they were order'd to go a cruizing; and one Morning spied a great Ship bearing down upon them, which they suppos'd to be a <HI>Spanish</HI> Man of War. Presently Orders were given to clear the Ship for Fight. <HI>Thomas</HI> then being upon the Deck, few plainly that a Time of Trial was now come, and he prayed to the Lord very earnestly for Strength: And that which seemed most expedient to him, was to meet with his Friends; which, after Notice given, was done accordingly. Being all met, he told them, how it was with him, and that Things seemed very dark and cloudy, yet <HI>his Hopes were, that the Lord would deliver him, and all such as were, of his Faith;</HI> to which he added, <HI>I lay not this as an Injunction upon any one, but leave you all to the Lord:</HI> Moreover he said, <HI>I must tell you, that the

Captain puts great Confidence in you; therefore let us be careful that we give him no just Occasion; and all that are of my Mind, let us meet in the most publick Place upon the Deck, in the full View of the Captain, that he may not say we deceived him, in not telling him that we would not fight, so that he might have put others in our Room.</HI> Then <HI>Thomas</HI> went upon the Deck, and set his Back against the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r-Capstan, and a little after turning his Head, he saw his Friends behind him; at which, tho' he rejoiced, yet his Bow∣els rowled within him, for them, who stood there as Sheep ready for the Slaughter. Within a little Time came the Lieutenant, and said to one of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They refuse to fight.</NOTE> <HI>Go down to thy Quarters:</HI> To which he returned, <HI>I can fight no more.</HI> The Lieutenant then going to the Captain, made the worst of it, saying, <HI>Yonder the</HI> Quakers <HI>are all together; and I do not know but they will mutiny, and one say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he cannot fight.</HI> The Captain having asked his Name, came down to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lung his Hat over-board, and taking Hold of his Collar, beat him with a great Cane, and dragg'd him down to his Quarters. Then he went upon the Half-deck again, and call'd for his Sword; which his Man having brought him, he drew with great Fury. No sooner was this done, but the Word of the Lord, as <HI>Thomas</HI> took it, run thro' him, saying, <HI>The Sword of the Lord is over him; and if he will have a Sacrifice, proffer i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him.</HI> And this Word was so powerful in him, that he quivered and shook, tho' he endeavoured to stop it, fear∣ing they should think he was afraid, which he was not; for turning his Head over his Shoulder, he said to his Friend <HI>Roger, I must go to the Captain.</HI> To which he returned, <HI>Be well satisfied in what thou doest.</HI> And <HI>Thomas</HI> reply'd, <HI>There was a Necessity upon him.</HI> Then seeing the Captain coming on with his drawn Sword, he fix'd his Eye with great Serious∣ness upon him, and stepp'd towards him, keeping his Eye upon him, (in much Dread of the Lord) being carried above his furious Looks. At which the Captain's Countenance changed pale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The furious Captain calm of a sudden.</NOTE> and he turning him∣self about, called to his Man to take away his Sword; and so he went off. Not long after, the Ship they expected to fight withal, proved to be a <HI>Genoese,</HI> their Friend; and before Night the Captain sent the Priest to <HI>Thomas,</HI> to excuse his Anger, it having been in his Passion. To which <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Answer was, <HI>That he had nothing but good Will to him;</HI> and he bad the Priest tell the Captain, <HI>That he must have a Care of such Pas∣sions; for if he killed a Man in his Passion, he might seek for Repentance, and perhaps not find it.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They come home.</NOTE> Thus <HI>Thomas</HI> overcame this Storm, and at length got safe home.</P>
<P>Now leaving Men of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes in a Merchant Ship, and be∣ing often prest into the King's Service, meets with many Trou∣bles.</NOTE> he afterwards went to Sea in a Merchant∣man, or trading Ship. But then it fell to be his Lot several Times to be press'd into the King's Service; and being car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed into a Man O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> War, he sustered very much: Once he fasted five Days, taking only at Times a Draught of Water; for he could easily guess, that if he had eaten of their Victuals, it would have gone the harder with him, since he scrupled to do any Ship-work, tho' it did not belong to fighting; for he judged all this to be Assistance to those whose Business it was to fight; and that therefore in such a Ship he could do nothing, what∣ever it was, but it was being helpful and assisting. In this Condition he met with several rude Occurrences for some Years together. Being once at <HI>Harwich,</HI> hard at work in a Ship, heaving out Corn in a Light∣er, he was press'd; but one of the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n saying, <HI>that he was a</HI> Quaker, the Captain, who with his Boat was come a-board, said in a scoffing Manner to him, <HI>Thou art no Quaker; for if thou wast a</HI> Quaker, <HI>thou should'st be waiting upon the Lord, and let his Ravens feed thee, and not be toiling thy Bo∣dy.</HI> For <HI>Thomas</HI> being stripp'd to his Shirt and Drawers, his Shirt was wet with Sweat; and being a little Time silent, said at length to the Captain, <HI>I perceive thou hast read some Part of the Scriptures: Didst thou never
<PB N="379" REF="003104_0390_0FEFF69AD0875E78"/>
read, that he is worse than an Infidel that will not provide for his Family? I have often heard the</HI> Quakers <HI>blamed for not working, but thou art the first that ever I heard blame them for working.</HI> At this the Captain said, <HI>Turn him away, he is a</HI> Quaker. But a little after he cried, <HI>Pull him again, he is no</HI> Quaker; and said to <HI>Thomas, Thou art no</HI> Quaker; <HI>for here thou bringest Corn, and of it is made Bread, and by the Strength of that Bread we kill the</HI> Dutch; <HI>and therefore no</HI> Quaker: <HI>Or art not thou as accessary to their Deaths, as we? Answer me. Thomas</HI> not presently answering, was much scoff'd and jeer'd by the Sea-men; but at length he said to the Captain, <HI>I am a Man that can feed my Enemies, and well may I you, who pretend to be my Friends.</HI> To which the Captain replied, <HI>Turn him away, he is a</HI> Quaker: And thus that Stormceased. But a few Days after, he was press'd again out of the same Vessel, and carried on board a Man of War; there he was ordered to go into the Cabin, where the Captain and several Offi∣cers were; and being entered, the Captain began to curse the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and swore, <HI>That if he did not hang</HI> Thomas, <HI>he would carry him to the Duke of</HI> York, <HI>and he would.</HI> But <HI>Thomas</HI> said very little, and felt himself kept by the Lord from Fear. And when the Captain had tired himself with scolding and railing, he said more mildly, <HI>What, dost thou say nothing for thy self?</HI> To which <HI>Thomas</HI> answer'd, <HI>Thou sayest enough for thee and me too:</HI> And he found it most safe to say little: This was indeed the best Way; for generally no Reasons, how good soever, avail with passio∣nate Men, who often think it a Disparagement to them, when they hearken to what is said by one they look upon to be their Inferior: But such sometimes find they reckon amiss; as this Captain did, who, not∣withstanding his Haughtiness, was soon struck by a superior Power; for the next Night a sudden Cry was heard, <HI>Where is the</HI> Quaker, <HI>Where's the</HI> Quaker? <HI>Thomas</HI> hearing this, said, <HI>Here I am: What lack you at this time of the Night?</HI> To which it was told him, <HI>You must came to the Cap∣tain presently.</HI> He then coming to the Cabin-door, the Captain said, <HI>Is the</HI> Quaker <HI>there?</HI> To which <HI>Thomas</HI> having answered, <HI>Yes,</HI> the Captain said, <HI>I cannot sleep, thou must go on Shore. Thomas</HI> reply'd, <HI>I am in thy Hand, and thou may'st do with me as thou pleasest.</HI> So with the Boat he was put on Shore at <HI>Harwich,</HI> by Order of the Captain, who in his Fu∣ry had said, That <HI>Hanging was too good for him:</HI> But now because his Mind was disquieted, he could not sleep, tho' <HI>Thomas,</HI> who lay on the hard Boards, slept very well.</P>
<P>Having said thus much of this Sea-man, let us now take a View and behold how, and in what an industrious Manner, he, without passing the Bounds of a peaceable Disposition, retook a Ship that was taken by a pyrate, which happened in the Year 1663, after this Manner.</P>
<P>A Master of a Ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther Relation of Occurrences that bafel <HI>T. Lurting,</HI> &amp;c. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te to <HI>G.

As soon as tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> came on board the Pyrate, the <HI>Turks</HI> put thirteen or fourteen of their Men into the Boat, to go towards the Eng∣lish Ship. In the mean while the Mate was under great Exercise of Mind, the rather because the Master, with four of his Men, were then with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and those that were left, were somewhat unruly. In this Concern however,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Lurting</HI> the Mate en∣couraged.</NOTE> he believed it was told him inwardly by the Lord, <HI>Be not afraid, for thou shalt not go to</HI> Algiers: For having had for∣merly
<PB N="380" REF="003104_0391_0FEFF6E3015B07D8"/>
great Experience of the Lord's Deliverances, as hath been said above, he had already learned to trust in God, almost against Hope: On the Consideration of this, all Fear was removed from him; and go∣ing to the Ship's Side to see the <HI>Turks</HI> come in, he received them as if they were his Friends; and they also behaved themselves civilly: Then he shewed them all the Parts of the Vessel, and what she was la∣den with. Afterwards he said to the Men that were with him, <HI>Be not afraid, for all this we shall not go to</HI> Algiers: <HI>But let me desire you, as ye have been willing to obey me, to be as willing now to obey the</HI> Turks. This they promis'd him; and by so doing he soon perceived they gained upon the <HI>Turks;</HI> for they seeing the Seamens Diligence, grew the more care∣less and favourable to them: And having taken some small Matter of the Lading, some went again to their own Ship, and eight <HI>Turks</HI> staid with the <HI>English.</HI> Then the Mate began to think of the Master, and the other Four that were in the <HI>Turks</HI> Ship; as for himself and the o∣thers with him, he had no Fear at all; nay, he was so far from it, that he said to one of his Men, <HI>Were but the Master on board, and the rest of our Men, if there were twice as many</HI> Turks, <HI>I should not fear them.</HI> By this he encouraged the Seamen, who not being of his Persuasion, thought much otherwise than he, and would have been ready enough to have kill'd the <HI>Turks,</HI> if they had seen Opportunity. In the mean while the Mate's earnest Desire to the Lord was, that he would put it into the Heart of the <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Master with the four Men sent back.</NOTE> to send the Master and the four others back. And his De∣sire was answer'd; for soon after the Master and those Men were sent on Board. Then all Manner of Fear concerning going to <HI>Algiers</HI> was taken away from him, which made some say to him, <HI>He was a strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, since he was afraid before he was taken, but now he was not.</HI> For before they were taken, he having heard there were many <HI>Turks</HI> at Sea, endea∣voured to persuade the Master to have gone to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and there to stay for a Convoy, and so long they would have no Wages. But to this the Master would not agree. Now the Mate, to answer the Seamen, who blamed his Behaviour, said to them, <HI>I now believe I shall not go to</HI> Algiers; <HI>and if ye will be ruled by me, I will act for your Delivery, as well as my own.</HI> However, tho' he spoke thus boldly, yet he saw no Way for it, for the <HI>Turks</HI> were all armed, and the <HI>English</HI> without Arms. Now these being altogether, except the Master, be said to them, <HI>What if we should overcome the</HI> Turks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mate opposes their Resolution to kill the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> <HI>and go to</HI> Majorca? At which they very much rejoiced, and one said, <HI>I will kill one or two; and I,</HI> said another, <HI>will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut as many of their Throats as you will have me.</HI> But at these Sayings, the Mate was much troubled, for he intended not to hurt any, and therefore told the Men, <HI>If I knew that any of you would touch a</HI> Turk <HI>at that Rate, I would tell it the</HI> Turks <HI>my self. But,</HI> said he, <HI>if ye will be ruled, I will act for you; if not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To whom they agree.</NOTE> <HI>I will be still.</HI> They seeing that he would not suffer them to take their own Course, agreed to do what he would have them: <HI>Well,</HI> said he, <HI>if the</HI> Turks <HI>bid you do any Thing, do it without Grumbling, and with as much Diligence and Quickness as you can, for that pleases them, and will cause them to let us be together.</HI> To this the Men all agreed; and then he went to the Master, and told him their Intentions. But his Answer was, <HI>if we offered to rise, and they overcame us, we had as good be burnt alive.</HI> The Mate knew very well the Master was in the right, <HI>viz.</HI> that if they failed in the Attempt, they were like to meet with the most cruel Treatment from the <HI>Turks</HI> that could be thought of. Now the Reason why the Master tho' a very bold spirited Man, did not readily consent to the Propo∣sal, was, because he feared they would shed Blood; but his Mate told him, <HI>They were resolved, and he questioned not but to do it, without shedding one Drop of Blood;</HI> and besides, <HI>he would rather have gone to</HI> Algiers, <HI>than to kill one</HI> Turk. Speaking thus, he so swayed the Master, that at last
<PB N="381" REF="003104_0392_0FEFF69D3749D6D0"/>
he agreed to let him do what he would, provided they kill'd none. Now since two <HI>Turks</HI> lay in the Cabin with the Master,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Master gives Liberty to the Mate.</NOTE> it was agreed that he should continue to lie there, lest they should mistrust any Thing. In the mean while it began to be bad Weather, so that they lost the Company of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Man of War, which was the Thing the Mate much desired; and the <HI>Turks</HI> seeing the Diligence of the <HI>English</HI> Sailors, grew careless concerning them, which was what the Mate aimed at. The second Night after, the Captain of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and one of his Com∣pany, being gone to sleep in the Cabin with the Master, the Mate per∣suaded one to lie in his Cabin, and about an Hour after, another in ano∣ther Cabin, and at last it raining very much, he pesuaded them all to lie down and sleep:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mate dis∣arms them while they are asleep.</NOTE> And when they were all asleep, he coming to them, fairly got their Arms into his Possession. This being done, he told his Men, <HI>Now we have the</HI> Turks <HI>at our Command, no Man shall hurt any of them; for if ye do, I will be against you: But this we will do, now they are under Deck, we will keep them so, and go for</HI> Majorca. Now having order'd some to keep the Doors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sail for <HI>Ma∣jorca.</HI></NOTE> they steered their Course to <HI>Majorca,</HI> and they had such a strong Gale, that in the Morning they were near it. Then he ordered his Men, if any offered to come out, not to let above one or two at a Time: And when one came out, expecting to have seen his own Country, he was not a little astonish'd instead thereof to see <HI>Majorca.</HI> Then the Mate said to his Men, <HI>Be careful of the Door, for when he goes in, we shall see what they will do. But have a Care not to spill Blood.</HI> The <HI>Turk</HI> being gone down, and telling his Comrades what he had seen, and how they were going to <HI>Majorca,</HI> they, instead of rising, all fell a crying, for their Courage was quite sunk, and they begg'd, that they might not be sold.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He promises not to sell them.</NOTE> This the Mate promis'd them, and said <HI>They should not.</HI> And when he had appeas'd them, he went into the Cabin to the Master, who knew nothing of what was done, and gave him an Account of the sudden Change, and how they had over∣come the <HI>Turks.</HI> Which, when he understood, he told their Captain, That <HI>the Vessel was now no more in their Possession, but in his again; and that they were going for</HI> Majorca. At this unexpected News the Cap∣tain wept, and desired the Master not to sell him; which he pro∣mis'd he would not.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They hide them from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></NOTE> Then they told him also, they would make a Place to hide them in, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> coming aboard should not find them. And so they did accordingly, at which the <HI>Turks</HI> were very glad. Being come into the Port of <HI>Majorca,</HI> the Master, with four Men, went a-shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrive at <HI>Majorca.</HI></NOTE> and left the Mate on board with ten <HI>Turks.</HI> The Master having done his Business, returned on Board, not taking License, lest the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> should come and see the <HI>Turks:</HI> But another <HI>English</HI> Master being an Acquaintance, lying there also with his Ship, came at Night on board; and after some Discourse, they told him what they had done, under Promise of Silence, lest the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should come and take away the <HI>Turks.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They refuse to sell them.</NOTE> But he broke his Promise, and would have had two or three of the <HI>Turks,</HI> to have brought them to <HI>England.</HI> His Design then being seen, his Demand was deny<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: And seeing he could not prevail, he said to <HI>Pattison</HI> and his Mate, That <HI>they were Fools, because they would not sell the</HI> Turks, <HI>which were each worth two or three hundred</HI> Pieces of Eight. But they told him, That <HI>if they would give many Thousands, they should not have one, for they hoped to send them home again; and to sell them,</HI> the Mate said, <HI>He would not have done for the whole Island.</HI> The other Master then coming a-shore, told the <HI>Spaniards</HI> what he knew of this, who then threatned to take away the <HI>Turks.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spaniards</HI> informed, threaten to take them a∣way.</NOTE> But <HI>Pattison</HI> and his Mate having heard this, called out the <HI>Turks,</HI> and said to them, <HI>Ye must help us, or the</HI> Spaniards <HI>will take you from us.</HI> To this the <HI>Turks,</HI> as one may ea∣sily guess, were very ready, and so they quickly got out to Sea: And the

<HI>English,</HI> to save the <HI>Turks,</HI> put themselves to the Hazard of being over∣come again; for they continued hovering several Days, because they would not put into any Port of <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They put out to Sea.</NOTE> for Fear of losing the <HI>Turks,</HI> to whom they gave Liberty for four or five Days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> loose on D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, attempt to rise, but are prevented.</NOTE> until they made an Attempt to rise; which the Mate perceiving, he prevented, without hurting any of them, tho' he once laid hold of one: Yet generally he was so kind to them, that some of his Men grumbled, and said, <HI>He had more Care for the</HI> Turks <HI>than for them.</HI> To which his Answer was, <HI>They were Strangers, and therefore he must treat them well.</HI> At length, after several Occurrences, the Mate told the Master, That <HI>he thought it best to go to the Coasts of</HI> Bar∣bary, <HI>because they were then like to miss their Men of War.</HI> To this the Master consented. However, to deceive the <HI>Turks,</HI> they sail'd to and fro for se∣veral Days; for in the Day Time they were for going to <HI>Algiers,</HI> but when Night came, they steered the contrary Way, and went back again, by which Means they kept the <HI>Turks</HI> in Ignorance, so as to be quiet.</P>
<P>But on the Ninth Day, being all upon Deck, when none of the <HI>English</HI> were there but the Master, his Mate, and the Man at the Helm, they began to be so untoward and haughty, that it rose in the Mate's Mind, <HI>What if they should lay hold on the Master, and casthim over board:</HI> For they were ten lusty Men, and he but a little Man. This Thought struck him with Terror; but recollecting himself, and taking Heart, he stamp'd with his Foot, and the Men coming up, one ask'd for the Crow, and another for the Ax, to fall on the Turks; but the Mate had them, <HI>Not to hurt the</HI> Turks, and said, <HI>I will lay hold on their Captain:</HI> Which he did, for having heard them threaten the Master, he stept forward, and laying hold of the Captain said, <HI>He must go down;</HI> which he did very quietly, and all the rest followed him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They draw to∣wards the <HI>Barbary.</HI> Shore, design∣ing to land the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> Two Days after, being come on the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> they were, according to what the Turks said, about fifty Miles from <HI>Algiers,</HI> and six from Land; and in the Afternoon it fell calm. But how to set the <HI>Turks</HI> on Shore was yet not resolved upon. The Mate saw well enough, that he being the Man who had begun this Business, it would be his Lot also to bring it to an End. He then ac∣quainted the Master that he was willing to carry the Turks on Shore; but how to do this safely, he as yet knew not certainly; for to give them the Boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But at a Loss how to do it with Safety.</NOTE> was too dangerous, for then they might get Men and Arms, and so come and retake the Ship with its own Boat; and to carry them on Shore with two or three of the Ship's Men, was also a great Hazard, because the Turks were ten in Number: And to put one half on Shore was no less dangerous; for then they might raise the Country, and so surprize the <HI>English</HI> when they came with the other half. In this great Strait the Mate said to the Master, <HI>If he would let him have the Boat and three Men to go with him, he would venture to put the</HI> Turks <HI>on Shore.</HI> The Master, relying perhaps on his Mate's Conduct, consented to the Pro∣posal, tho' not without some Tears dropt on both Sides. Yet the Mate taking Courage, said to the Master, <HI>I believe the Lord will preserve me, for I have nothing but Goodwill in venturing my Life; and I have not the least Fear upon me;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mate pro∣poses with 3 to go with him in the Boat, to put them on Shore, being 10 in Num∣ber.</NOTE> but trust that all will do well. The Master having consented, the Mate called up the <HI>Turks,</HI> and going with two Men and a Boy in the Boat, took in these ten <HI>Turks,</HI> all loose and unbound. Perhaps some body will think this to be a very inconsiderate Act of the Mate, and that it would have been more prudent to have tyed the <HI>Turks</HI> Hands, the rather because he had made the Men promise, that they should do nothing to the <HI>Turks,</HI> until he said, <HI>He could do no more;</HI> for then he gave them Liberty to act for their Lives so as they judg'd conve∣nient. Now since he knew not how near he should bring the <HI>Turks</HI> ashore, and whether they should not have been necessitated to swim a little, it seemed not prudent, to do any Thing which might have exas∣perated
<PB N="383" REF="003104_0394_0FEFF69F8358D790"/>
them; for if it had fallen out so that they must have swain, then of Necessity they must have been un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, which would have been dangerous. Yet the Mate did not omit to be as careful as possible he could. For calling in the Captain of the <HI>Turks,</HI> he plac'd him first in the Boat's Stern; then calling for another, he plac'd him in his Lap, and one on each side, and two more in their Laps, until he had placed them all; which he did to prevent a sudden rising. He himself sat with a Boat-hook in his Hand on the Bow of the Boat, having next to him one of the Ship-men, and two that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owed, having one a Carpenters Adds, and the other a Coopers Heading-knife. These were all their Arms, besides what belonged to the <HI>Turks,</HI> which they had at their Command. Thus the Boat went off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Boat puts off towards the Shore.</NOTE> and stood for the Shore. But as they came near it, the Men g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owing afraid, one of them cried out of a sudden, <HI>Lord have Merey on us, there are</HI> Turks <HI>in the Bushes on Shore.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> in the Boat perceiving the <HI>English</HI> to be afraid, all rose at once. But the Mate, who in this great Strait continued to be hearty, shewed himself now to be a Man or Courage, and bid the Men to <HI>Take up such Arms as they had; but do nothing with them until he gave them Leave.</HI> And then seeing that there were no Men in the Bushes, and that it was only an Imagination, all Fear was taken away from him, and his Courage increasing, he thought with himself, <HI>It is better to strike a Man, than to cleave a Man's Head;</HI> and turning the Boat-hook in his Hand, he struck the Captain a smart Blow, and bid him sit down; which he did in∣stantly, and so did all the rest. After the Boat was come so near the Shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He sets the <HI>Turks</HI> on Shore.</NOTE> that they could easily wade, the Mate bid the <HI>Turks</HI> jump out, and so they did, and because they said, they were about four Miles from a Town, he gave them some Loaves, and other Necessaries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves them Provisions.</NOTE> They would fain have persuaded the <HI>English</HI> to go with them a-shore to a Town, promising to treat them with Wine, and other good Things: But tho' the Mate trusted in divine Providence, yet he was not so careless as freely to enter into an apparent Danger, without being necessitated there∣to: For tho' he had some Thoughts that the <HI>Turks</HI> would not have done him any Evil, yet it was too hazardous thus to have yielded to the Mercy of those that lived there: And therefore he very prudently rejected their Invitation, well knowing that the Scripture saith, <HI>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> seeing they could not per∣suade him, took their Leaves with Signs of great Kindness, and so went on Shore. The <HI>English</HI> then putting the Boat closer in, threw them all their Arms on Shore, being unwilling to keep any Thing of theirs. And when the <HI>Turks</HI> got up the Hill, they wav'd their Caps at the <HI>English,</HI> and so joyfully took their last Farewel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Boat comes aboard, and they sail with a fair Wind.</NOTE> And as soon as the Boat came again on board, they had a fair Wind, which they had not all the while the <HI>Turks</HI> were on board. Thus <HI>Thomas Lurting</HI> saved the Ship and its Men; which being thus wonderfully preserved, returned to <HI>England</HI> with a prosperous Wind. Now before the Vessel arrived at <HI>London,</HI> the News of this extraordinary Case was come thither, and when she was coming up the <HI>Tham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> the King, with the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and several Lords being at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> it was told him, there was a <HI>Quakers</HI> Ketch coming up the River, that had been taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and redeemed themselves without sighting:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King be∣ing at <HI>Green∣wich,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a Barge to the Ship's-side, and has the Narration from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> The King hearing this, came with his Barge to the Ship's-side, and holding the entering Rope in his Hand, he understood from the Mate's own Mouth, how the Thing had hap∣pened. But when he heard him say, how they had let the <HI>Turks</HI> go free, he said to the Master, <HI>You have done like a Fool, for you might have had good Gain for them:</HI> And to the Mate he said, <HI>You should have brought the</HI> Turks <HI>to me.</HI> But the Mate answered, <HI>I thought it better for them to be in their own Country.</HI> At which the King and others smiled, and so went
<PB N="384" REF="003104_0395_0FEFF6E88034E310"/>
away, thinking that the Master had done foolishly; but he and his Mate were of another Opinion, and they made it appear that they did ap∣prove the Lesson of our Saviour, <HI>Love your Enemies, and do Good to those that hate you,</HI> not only with their Mouths, but that they had also put it into Practice.</P>
<P>Tho' I have described this Fact from a printed Relation, yet I have added some Circumstances from the Mouth of the said Mate, with whom I had some Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Several Years afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some <HI>Quakers</HI> Slaves at <HI>Al∣giers</HI></NOTE> when some Sea-men of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were in Slavery at <HI>Algiers, G.

To this he added a succinct Narrative of what hath been related here of <HI>G.

Now concerning those <HI>Quakers</HI> at <HI>Algiers,</HI> of whom Mention hath been made that they were Slaves there, it was a pretty long Time before Opportunity was found to redeem them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are suf∣fered to walk loose thro' the Town. And to have religious Meetings.</NOTE> But in the mean while they so faithfully served their Masters, that they were suffered to go loose thro' the Town, without being chain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter'd; and Liberty was also allowed them to meet at set Times for religious Worship; and their Patrons themselves would sometimes come and see what they did there; and finding no Images or Prints, as <HI>Papist</HI> Slaves in the Exercise of their Worship made use of, but hearing from their Slaves that they reverently adored and wor∣shipped the living God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Way of Worship com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded by their Patrons.</NOTE> Creator of Heaven and Earth, they commended them for it, and said it was very good, and that they might freely do so. And since one of them was raised to speak by Way of Edification to his Friends, some other <HI>English</HI> Slaves frequenting that Meeting, came to be united with them. In the mean while the Name <HI>Quakers</HI> came to be known at <HI>Algiers,</HI> as a People that might be trusted beyond others.</P>
<P>It was in this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Caton</HI> in∣terprets to the Author's Mo∣ther at a Mee∣ting in King∣stone.</NOTE> that <HI>William Caton</HI> went into <HI>England</HI> with his Wife from <HI>Holland,</HI> (where he was married) and two Friends more, one of which was <HI>Judith Zinspenning,</HI> my Mother, who was moved to speak at the Meeting at <HI>Kingstone,</HI> where <HI>W. Caton</HI> interpreted for her. At another Time being in a Meeting at <HI>London,</HI> and he not present, and feeling her self stirred up to declare of the loving Kindness of the Lord to those that feared him, she desired one <HI>Peter Sybrands,</HI> to be her In∣terpreter; but he, tho' an honest Man, yet not very fit for that Ser∣vice, one or more Friends told her, they were so sensible of the Power by which she spoke, that tho' they did not understand her Words, yet they were edify<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Life and Power that accompany'd her Speech, and therefore they little matter'd the Want of Interpretation; and so she went on without any Interpreter. She had indeed a very good Talent, and left such Repute behind, that I coming several Years af∣ter into <HI>England,</HI> Kindness was shewed me in several Places on her Ac∣count. After a Stay of some Weeks at <HI>London,</HI> and thereabouts, she went to <HI>Colchester,</HI> in Order to return with <HI>W. Caton</HI>'s Wife to <HI>Holland;</HI> but making some Stay in that Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">She writes a Book of Pro∣verbs.</NOTE> she there wrote a Book of Pro∣verbs, which <HI>W. Caton</HI> having translated into <HI>English,</HI> was printed at <HI>Lon∣don:</HI> And after her Departure, he staying behind, travelled thro' <HI>Essex, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Darbyshire, Nottinghamshire,</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and coming into <HI>Lancashire,</HI> he repaired to <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> and found there

not only his ancient Mistress <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> who received him very kindly, but also <HI>G. Fox,</HI> not long before he was taken Prisoner.</P>
<P>From thence <HI>Caton</HI> went to <HI>Sunderland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He embarks for <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> and so to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> where meeting with a Vessel bound for <HI>Holland,</HI> he embarked, and went off with a fair Wind: But it was not long before the Wind changed; and being about ten Leagues from the Land, the Sky began to look tempe∣stuous; which made <HI>Caton</HI> advise the Master to return; but he think∣ing the Weather would soon change, was unwilling to do so; yet it fell out otherwise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dreadful Storm.</NOTE> for a violent Storm arose, by which the Ship was so exceedingly tost, that she grew leaky, and took so much Water, that the Pumps continually must be kept going. But this so wearied the Seamen, that <HI>Caton</HI> also fell to pumping; for tho' he found himself pre∣pared to meet Death, if it had been the Will of the Lord, yet he knew it to be the Duty of a Man to preserve his Life by lawful Means, as long as possible; besides he pitied the poor Seamen, and so was made wil∣ling to help them as much as lay in his Power.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are in extream Dan∣ger.</NOTE> But at length they lost the Use of the Rudder, and were near the Sands and Shallows, by which the Danger was greatly increased, and Death seemed to approach.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Caton,</HI> tho' given up in the Will of the Lord, and prepared to have found his Grave in the Deep, yet did not omit to call upon the Lord, and to pray to the Most High for Deliverance, if it were consist∣ent with his holy Will; and when the Storm was at the highest, his Supplication was heard, and the Tempest on a sudden began to cease, and the Wind to abate, which gave him Occasion to praise the Almighty for the great Mercy shewed to him and the Mariners.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And driven to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> where <HI>W. Ca∣ton</HI> is taken up and impri∣son'd above six Months.</NOTE> Yet the Wind be∣ing contrary, the Master resolved to enter <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> where <HI>Caton</HI> met with another Storm: For on the first Day of the Week, being at a Meeting of his Friends, he with seven more were apprehended, and carried to the Main Guard. The next Day they were brought before the Bailiffs of the Town, who tendered them the Oath of Allegiance; which they refusing to take, were sent to Prison, where he was kept above six Months, so that it was not till the next Year that he returned into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst he was in Jail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Crisp.</NOTE> <HI>Stephen Crisp</HI> came the first time into <HI>Holland,</HI> to visit his Friends there, and to edify them with his Gift. It won't be amiss here to say a little of his Qualifications.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A brief Ac∣count of him.</NOTE> He was a Man of notable natural Abilities, and had been zealous for Religion before ever he en∣tered into Followship with those called <HI>Quakers.</HI> But when the Report of this People spread it self in the Place where he lived, he made Enquiry after them and their Doctrine, and tho' he heard nothing but Evil spoken of them, it nevertheless made some Impression upon his Mind, when he considered how they were derided, hated, slandered, and persecuted; because this generally had been the Lot of those that truly feared God. But having heard that one of their Tenets was, that Sin might be overcome in this Life, this seemed to him a great Error. And therefore when <HI>James Parnel</HI> came to <HI>Colchester,</HI> he armed himself with Arguments to oppose him earnestly: For looking upon him as one that was but a Youth, he thought he should be able to prevail upon him. He himself was then about seven and twenty Years of Age, being not only well versed in sacred Writ, but also in the Writings of many of the ancient Philosophers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is convin∣ced by <HI>J. Par∣nel.</HI></NOTE> Now after he had heard <HI>Parnel</HI> preach very powerfully and found his Words more piercing than he had imagin'd, he ventur'd to oppose him with some Queries: But he soon found, that this young Man was endued with sound Judgment; and with all his Wis∣dom and Knowledge he was not able to resist him, but was forced to submit to the Truth he held forth. Now he thought himself so en∣riched, that for a Month or two he made it his Business by the Strength
<PB N="386" REF="003104_0397_0FEFF6EA3076FB80"/>
of his Reason to defend the Truth he had embraced. But he soon found that this was not sufficient; for Self was not subdued under the Cross, and he was not yet come to an experimental Knowledge of what he as∣serted and defended with Words. In this Condition he saw that he must truly become poor in Spirit, if God ever should enrich him with heavenly Wisdom. This brought him to Mourning and Sorrow, by which he came more and more to be weaned from his natural Know∣ledge, wherein he used to delight. And continuing faithful in this Way of Self-denial, he at length began to enjoy Peace in his Mind, and so advanced in Virtue and real Knowledge, that in Time he became an eminent Minister of the Gospel, and travelling to and fro, many were converted by his Ministry.</P>
<P>About this Time appeared in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L. Muggle∣ton.</HI> and <HI>J.

And tho' it was not long before <HI>Reeves</HI> died, yet <HI>Muggleton</HI> continued in his wild Imaginations, which grew to that De∣gree, that he gave forth a Paper, in which he said, that <HI>he was the Chief Judge in the World, and in passing the Sentence of eternal Death and Damna∣tion upon the Souls and Bodies of Men. That in Obedience to his Commission be had already cursed and damned many Hundreds of People both Body and Soul, from the Presence of God, elect M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and Angels, to Eternity. That he went by as certain a Rule in so doing, as the Judges of the Land do when they give Judgment according to Law. And that no infinite Spirit of Christ, nor any God could or should be able to deliver from his Sentence and Curse,</HI> &amp;c. These abominable Blasphemies he gave forth in publick.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Farnsworth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.

Consider that thy Injustice done by Colour of Office, deserves to have a Punishment proportionable to the Offence; and can the Offence in the Eye of the Lord be any less than Sin against the Holy Ghost, because thou hast pretended to do it in the Name of the Holy Ghost, and so would'st make the Holy Ghost the Author of thy Offence, which it is not? And seeing thou art guilty of Sin against the Holy Ghost, there is a Punishment already proportioned for such an Offence; and also thou art punishable by the Law of the Land, for presuming under Pretence of a Commission, and as a Judge, to pass the Sentence of Death upon the Bodies of Men and Women, and pretending to go by as cer∣tain a Rule in so doing, as the Judges of the Land do,</HI> &amp;c Thus continued <HI>Farnsworth</HI> to answer <HI>Muggleton</HI> at large, and shewed him how his Judg∣ment was not only contrary to Truth, but also against the Law of the Land. But he was daring enough to give a Reply to this serious An∣swer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Muggleton</HI> replies.</NOTE> and said in it, <HI>That he should commend</HI> Farnsworth, First, <HI>For set∣ting his Name to it;</HI> and Secondly, <HI>For setting down his Words so truly and punctually, that it made his Commission and Authority to shine the more bright and clear. And that he was as true an Ambassador of God, and Judge of Mens spiritual Estate, as any ever was since the Creation of the World. And if you</HI> Quakers <HI>and others</HI> (thus continued he) <HI>can satisfy your selves, that there never was any Man commissioned of God to bless and curse, then you shall all escape that Curse I have pronounced upon so many Hundreds; and I only shall suffer for cursing others without a Commission from God. But my Commission is no pretended Thing, but as true as</HI> Moses<HI>'s, the Prophets, and the Apostles Commission was.</HI> A Multitude more of Abominations this Blasphemer belched out, and among the rest, <HI>That no Man could come to the Assurance

of the Favour of God, but in believing that God gave this Power unto</HI> John Reeves <HI>and himself. That be had Power given him over all other Gods and infinite Spirits whatsoever. That he</HI> [Muggleton] <HI>had the Keys of Heaven, and of Hell; and that none could get into Heaven, except he opened the Gates. That he had Power to remit their Sins who received his Doctrine, and to retain and bind their Sins more close upon their Consciences, for their despising or not receiving his Doctrine. That he was single in Doctrine, Knowledge, Judgment and Power, above all Men, either Prophets or Apostles, since the Beginning of the World, or that should be hereafter whilst the World doth endure. That there was no true Minister, Messenger, nor Ambassador of God in the World but him∣self, neither should there be sent any of God after him to the World's End. That a God, without him, spoke to him by Voice of Words to the hearing of the Ear. That no Person condemned by him could make his Appeal unto God, nei∣ther by himself nor by any other; because God was not in the World at all. This Power to condemn</HI> (saith he) <HI>hath God given unto me, and in this Regard I am the only and alone Judge what shall become of Men and Women after Death; neither shall those that are damned by me, see any other God or Judge but me.</HI> I am loth to transcribe more of these most horrible Blasphemies; and we have Cause to wonder at the long Forbearance of God, that he thus bore the disdainful Affront offered by this inhumane Monster in Defi∣ance of his Almightiness. This <HI>Muggleton</HI> said also to <HI>Farnsworth,</HI> That <HI>Because he was not under the Sentence of his Commission by Verbal Words or Writing, he should give Answer to his Letter. For</HI> (said he) <HI>I never give An∣swer in Writing to any one that is under the Sentence of my Commission.</HI> This Shuffle, not to be bound to answer, when he had shut up any one un∣der his pretended Damnation, seemed comical and facetious. Yet <HI>Farns∣worth</HI> did not omit to answer his blasphemous Positions publickly, and to shew the Absurdity of <HI>Muggleton</HI> and <HI>John Reeves</HI>'s being the two Witnesses. Hereafter I shall have Occasion again to make Mention of this <HI>Muggleton,</HI> for he lived yet several Years; and I don't find that any Punishment was inflicted on him by the Magistrates, other than the Pillory, and half a Year's Imprisonment; tho' many think, not without good Reason, that such Blasphemers ought to be secluded from Conver∣sation with Men.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS. The EIGHTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing Year we left <HI>G. Fox</HI> in <HI>Lancaster</HI>-Prison,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1664</NOTE> where at the Sessions the Oath of Allegiance being tendred to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Lancaster G. Fox</HI> is brought before Judge <HI>Twis∣den,</HI> and ex∣amined.</NOTE> and refused by him, he was brought to his Trial in the Month called <HI>March,</HI> which begins the Year 1664. Being brought to the Bar before Judge <HI>Twisden,</HI> he said <HI>Peace be amongst you all.</HI> At which the Judge looking upon him, said, <HI>What! Do you come into the Court with your Hat on?</HI> Where∣upon the Jailor taking it off, <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>The Hat is not the Honour that comes from God.</HI> Then said the Judge, <HI>Will you take the Oath of Allegiance? G. Fox</HI> answered, <HI>I never took any Oath in my Life. Well,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>Will you swear, or no? G. Fox</HI> reply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>I am a Christian, and Christ commands me not to swear; and so doth the Apostle</HI> James <HI>likewise; and whether I should obey God or Man, do thou judge. I ask you again,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>Whether you will swear or no?</HI> To which he made Answer, <HI>I am neither</HI> Turk, Jew, <HI>nor</HI> Heathen, <HI>but a</HI> Christian, <HI>and should shew forth Christianity. Dost thou not know</HI> (thus he went on) <HI>that Christians in the Primitive Times un∣der the ten Persecutions, and some also of the Martyrs in Queen</HI> Mary's <HI>Days refused Swearing, because Christ and the Apostle had forbidden it? Ye have Ex∣perience enough, how many Men have sworn first to the King, and then against him. But as for me, I have never taken an Oath in all my Life; and my Allegiance doth not lie in swearing, but in Truth and Faithfulness: For I honour all Men, much more the King. But Christ, who is the great Prophet, who is the King of Kings, the Saviour of the World, and the great Judge of the whole World, he saith, I must not swear. Now the Point is, whether I must obey Christ, or thee. For it is in Tenderness of Conscience, and in Obedience to the Command of Christ, that I do not swear. And we have the Word of a King for tender Consciences. G. Fox</HI> having spoke thus much, ask'd the Judge, <HI>If he did own the King?</HI> To which he said, <HI>Yes, I do own the King. Why then,</HI> said he, <HI>Dost thou not observe his Declaration from</HI> Breda, <HI>and his Pro∣mises made since he came into</HI> England, That no Man should be called in Question for Matters of Religion, so long as they lived peaceably? <HI>Now if thou ownest the King, why dost thou call me into Question, and put me upon taking an Oath, seeing thou or none can charge me with unpeaceable Living?</HI> The Judge looking angry, said, <HI>Sirrah, will you swear?</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> told him, <HI>I am none of thy Sirrahs; I am a Christian; and for thee, who art an Old Man and a Judge, to sit there, and give Nick-names to Prisoners, doth not become either thy grey Hairs or thy Office.</HI> The Judge being a little more cool, after some Words to and fro, said, <HI>G. Fox, Say, whether thou wilt take the Oath, Yea, or Nay?</HI> To which he reply'd, <HI>If I could take any Oath at all, I should take this: For I do not deny some Oaths only, or on some Occa∣sions, but all Oaths, according to Christ's Doctrine, who said,</HI> Swear not at all. <HI>Now if thou, or any of you, or any of your Ministers or Priests here, will prove that ever Christ or his Apostle, after they had forbidden all Swearing com∣manded Christians to swear, then I will swear.</HI> None of the Priests offering
<PB N="390" REF="003104_0401_0FEFD56913871988"/>to speak, the Judge said, <HI>I am a Servant to the King, and the King sent me not to dispute with you, but to put the Laws in Execution.</HI> And there∣fore <HI>I tender the Oath of Allegiance, G. Fox</HI> continuing to refuse Swear∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is sent back to Prison for the next Assizes.</NOTE> was sent again to Prison. Two Days after, being brought again before the Judge, it was asked him, <HI>Whether he would traverse or submit▪</HI> To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> said, <HI>He desired he might have Liberty to traverse the In∣dictment, and try it.</HI> Then Order was given to take him away, and he was kept in Prison till the next Assizes.</P>
<P>Being Prisoner in <HI>Lancaster</HI> Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What hap∣pen'd to him in <HI>Lancaster-Castle.</HI></NOTE> there was much Talk of the <HI>Turks</HI> great Progress in <HI>Hungary,</HI> there being at that Time a War between the Emperor and the <HI>Turks;</HI> and many being afraid, he said to some, <Q>That walking once in his Chamber, he saw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Power turn against the <HI>Turk,</HI> and that he was turning back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></Q> And within a Month after, News came that he was defeated. Another Time, as he was walking in the Room, with his Mind upon the Lord, he saw an extraordinary great Light, and looking up, he beheld an Angel of the Lord, with a glittering Sword stretched Southward, which shone so bright, as if the Court had been all on Fire. Or which I have for Proof what he mentions of it in his Journal, and also another small Book he gave out with the Title of <HI>A Warning to</HI> England. Not long after, a War broke out between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and some Time after the Pestilence appeared at <HI>London,</HI> (which lies Southerly from <HI>Lan∣caster)</HI> and after two Years, that City by the Fire was turned into Rubbish.</P>
<P>But I return to the <HI>Lancaster</HI> Assizes. <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> who was now a Widow, was also under Confinement for refusing the Oath of Allegi∣ance. And <HI>G. Fox</HI> being in Prison, writ several Papers to the Magistrates, in which he manifested the Evil of Persecution, and exhorted to Virtue and Piety.</P>
<P>In the Month called <HI>August,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is brought before Judge <HI>Turner</HI> at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> next Assizes.</NOTE> the Assizes were held again at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>G. Fox</HI> being brought thither, Judge <HI>Turner</HI> then sat on the Crown-Bench; and being called to the Bar, the Judge ask'd the Justices, <HI>Whe∣ther they had tendered him the Oath at the foregoing Sessions?</HI> They saying, <HI>they had,</HI> and having sworn it, the Jury were sworn too. Then the Judge ask'd him, <HI>Whether he had not refused the Oath at the last Assizes?</HI> To which he answered, <HI>I never took Oath in my Life; and Christ the Saviour and Judge of the World, said,</HI> Swear not at all. The Judge seeming not to take Notice of this Answer, ask'd him, <HI>Whether or no he had not refu∣sed to take the Oath at the last Assizes? G. Fox</HI> maintaining the Unlawful∣ness of swearing, the Judge said, <HI>He was not at that Time to dispute whe∣ther it was lawful to swear, but to enquire whether he had refused to take the Oath, or no. G. Fox</HI> then signifying that he did not disapprove the Things mentioned in the Oath, said, <HI>Plotting against the King, and owning the Pope's, or any other foreign Power, I utterly deny.</HI> Well, said the Judge, <HI>You say well in that: But did you deny to take the Oath; what say you? What would'st thou have me to say?</HI> reply'd he, <HI>I have told thee before what I did say.</HI> After some more Words from both Sides, the Indictment was read. <HI>G. Fox</HI> having inform'd himself of the Errors that were in it, said, <HI>He had something to speak to it, for there were many gross Errors in it.</HI> The Judge signified that he would not hear him; but when he was at the Point of giving Judgment. The Jury going out, soon returned, and brought him in guilty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is brought in guilty.</NOTE> Whereupon he told them, <HI>That both the Justices and they too had forsworn themselves;</HI> which caused such Confusion in the Court, that the pronouncing Judgment was delay'd. <HI>Margaret Fell</HI> being next brought to the Bar, was also declared guilty: And the next Day she and <HI>G Fox</HI> were brought up again to receive Sentence. Her Council plead∣ing many Errors in her Indictment, she was set by; and <HI>G. Fox</HI> then being call'd, shewed himself unwilling to let any Man plead for him;
<PB N="391" REF="003104_0402_0FEFF72EDFA1BF70"/>
which seem'd to make some Stop; yet he was ask'd by the Judge, what he had to say why he should not pass Sentence upon him. At which he told him, <HI>I am no Lawyer, but yet I have much to say, if thou wilt but have Patience to hear.</HI> Hereupon those on the Bench laughed, and said, <HI>Come, what have you to say?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proves the In∣dictment erro∣neous in seve∣ral Instances.</NOTE> Then he ask'd the Judge, Whe∣ther the Oath was to be tendered to the King's Subjects, or to the Sub∣jects of foreign Princes. To which the Judge said, <HI>To the Subjects of this Realm.</HI> Then said <HI>George, Look the Indictment, and ye may see that ye have left out the Word</HI> Subject: <HI>And not having named me in the Indictment as a Subject, ye cannot premunire me for not taking the Oath.</HI> They then looking to the Statute, and the Indictment, saw that it was as he said, and the Judge confessed that it was an Error. Next <HI>G. F.</HI> told him, <HI>He had something else to stop Judgment;</HI> and he desired them to look what Day the Indictment said the Oath was tendered to him at the Sessions there: They looking, said it was the eleventh of <HI>January.</HI> Then he ask'd, <HI>What Day of the Week was that Session held on? On a</HI> Tuesday, said they. To which <HI>G. F.</HI> said, <HI>Look in your Almanacks, and see whether there was any Session held at</HI> Lancaster <HI>on the eleventh of</HI> January. They looking, found that the eleventh Day was the Day called <HI>Monday,</HI> and that the Sessions were on the Day called <HI>Tuesday,</HI> which was the twelfth Day of the said Month: <HI>Look ye now,</HI> said he, <HI>ye have indicted me for refusing the Oath in the Quarter-Sessions held at</HI> Lancaster <HI>on the eleventh Day of</HI> Janu∣ary <HI>last, and the Justices have sworn that they tendered me the Oath in open Sessions here that Day; and the Jury upon their Oath have found me guilty thereupon; and yet ye see there was no Sessions held at</HI> Lancaster <HI>that Day.</HI> The Judge, to cover the Matter, askt, <HI>Whether the Sessions did not begin on the eleventh Day?</HI> To which some in the Court answered, <HI>No; the Sessions held but one Day, and that was the twelfth.</HI> Then the Judge said, <HI>This was a great Mistake, and an Error.</HI> Some of the Justices grew to angry at this, that they seeming ready to have gone off the Bench, stampt, and said, <HI>Who hath done this? Some Body hath done this on purpose.</HI> Then said <HI>G.F. Are not the Justices here that have sworn to this Indictment, forsworn Men? But this is not all; I have more yet to offer why Sentence should not be given against me. In what Year of the King was it, that the last Assize, which was in the Month called</HI> March, <HI>was holden here?</HI> To this the Judge said, <HI>It was in the sixteenth Year of the King.</HI> But, said <HI>G. F. The Indictment says it was in the fifteenth Year.</HI> This was also acknowledged to be an Error: But both Judge and Justices were in such a Fret, that they knew not what to say; for it had been sworn also, that the Oath was tendered to <HI>G. F.</HI> at the Assize mention'd in the Indictment, <HI>viz.</HI> in the fifteenth Year of the King, whereas it was in the sixteenth; which made <HI>G. F.</HI> say, <HI>Is not the Court here forsworn also, they having sworn a whole Year false?</HI> Some other re∣markable Errors he shew'd, which I, having no Mind to be tedious, pass by with Silence. <HI>G. F.</HI> then desiring <HI>Justice,</HI> and saying, <HI>that he did not look for Mercy,</HI> the Judge said, <HI>You must have Justice, and you shall have Law:</HI> Which made him ask,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indict∣ment quash'd.</NOTE> <HI>Am I now free from all that hath been done against me in this Matter? Yes,</HI> said the Judge; but then starting up in a Rage, he said, <HI>I can put the Oath to any Man here; and I will tender you the Oath again. G. F.</HI> then telling him, that he had Examples enough of Yesterday's swear∣ing, and false swearing; <HI>for I saw before my Eyes,</HI> said he, <HI>that both Justi∣ces and Jury forswore themselves;</HI> yet the Judge ask'd him if he would take the Oath:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is acknow∣ledg'd to be at Liberty, yet not dismiss'd.</NOTE> But he reply'd, <HI>Do me Justice for my false Imprisonment all this while;</HI>
for he had been lock'd up, as was well known, in a wet and cold Room, and therefore he said, <HI>I ought to be set at Liberty.</HI> At which the Judge said, <HI>You are at Liberty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Oath is tender'd, and he is indicted again.</NOTE> <HI>but
I will put the Oath to you again. G. F.</HI> then turning himself about, said to the People, <HI>Take Notice, this is a Snare; but I ought to be set free from the Jailor, and from this Court.</HI> But
<PB N="392" REF="003104_0403_0FEFF7DBD22FF9B0"/>
the Judge, instead of hearkening to that, cried, <HI>Give him the Book. G. F. then taking the Book, and looking in it, said, <HI>I see it is a Bible, and I am glad of it.</HI> In the mean while the Jury being called by Order of the Judge, they stood by; for tho' they had desired, after they had brought in their former Verdict, to be dismiss'd, yet he told them, <HI>He could not dismiss them yet, because he should have Business for them; and therefore they must attend, and be ready. G. F.</HI> perceiving his Intent, look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him in the Face, which made him blush: Nevertheless he caused the Oath to be read, and then ask'd <HI>G. F. Whether he would take the Oath or no?</HI> To which he said, <HI>Ye have given me a Book here to kiss, and to swear on; and this Book says,</HI> Kiss the Son; <HI>and the Son saith in this Book,</HI> Swear not at all; <HI>and so says also the Apostle</HI> James: <HI>Now I say, as the Book says, and yet ye imprison me, for doing as the Book bids me. How chance ye do not imprison the Book for saying so? How comes it that the Book is at Li∣berty amongst you, which bids me</HI> swear not? <HI>Why don't ye imprison the Book also?</HI> Whilst he was speaking thus, he held up the Bible open, to shew the Place where Christ forbids swearing. But the Book was taken from him, and the Judge said, <HI>No, but we will imprison</HI> George Fox. This Case was so singular, that it was spread over all the Country, as a By-Word, <HI>That they gave</HI> G. Fox <HI>a Book, to swear on, that commanded him,</HI> not to swear at all; <HI>and that this Book,</HI> viz. <HI>the Bible, was at Liberty, and he in Prison, for doing as the Bible said:</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Judge urg∣ed him still to swear; to which <HI>G. F.</HI> said, <HI>I am a Man of a tender Con∣science; consider therefore, that it is in Obedience to Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Command that I can∣not swear: But if any of you can convince me, that after Christ and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apo∣stle had commanded</HI> not to swear, <HI>they did alter that Command, and com∣manded Christians to swear, then ye shall see I will swear.</HI> And he seeing there, several Priests, said, <HI>If ye cannot do it, let your Priests do it,</HI> But none of the Priests said any Thing; and the Judge said, <HI>All the World cannot convince you.</HI> To which he reply'd, <HI>How is it like the World should convince me? For the whole World lies in Wickedness: But bring out your spi∣ritual Men, as ye call them, to convince me.</HI> Then the Sheriff and the Judge said, <HI>That the Angel swore in the</HI> Revelations. To which <HI>G. Fox</HI> reply'd, <HI>When God bringeth in his First-begotten Son into the World, he saith, Let all the Angels of God worship him; and he said,</HI> Swear not at all. <HI>Nay,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>I will not dispute.</HI> Then he told the Jury, <Q>It was for Christ's Sake that he could not swear; and therefore he warned them not to act contrary to that of God in their Consciences, because they must all appear before his Judgment-Seat.</Q> After some more Words spoken, the Jailor took him away. And in the Afternoon, he was brought up again.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And brought in guilty.</NOTE> The Jury having brought him in guilty of what he was charged with in the Indictment, <HI>viz.</HI> his not taking the Oath, the Judge asked him, <HI>What he had to say for himself.</HI> He then desired the Indictment to be read; since he could not answer to that which he had not heard. The Clerk reading it, the Judge said, <HI>Take Heed it be not false again.</HI> But the Clerk read it in such a Manner, that <HI>G F.</HI> could hardly understand what he read. And when he had done, the Judge ask'd <HI>G. F. What he had to say to the Indictment?</HI> To which he said, <HI>At once hearing so large a Writing read, and that at such a Distance, that I could not distinctly hear all the Parts of it, I cannot well tell what to say to it: But if you will let me have a Copy of it, and give me Time to consider, I shall an∣swer it.</HI> This put the Court to a little Stand; but at length the Judge asked him, <HI>What Time he would have?</HI> And he answered, <HI>Till the next Assize. But,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>what Plea will you make now? are you guilty, or not guilty?</HI> To which he replied, <HI>I am not guilty at all of denying swear∣ing obstinately and wilfully: And as for those Things mention'd in the Oath, as</HI>
<PB N="393" REF="003104_0404_0FEFF730B254F2E0"/>
jesuitical Plots, <HI>and</HI> foreign Powers, <HI>I utterly deny them in my Heart▪ And if I could take any Oath, I should take this; but I never took any Oath in all my Life.</HI> To this the Judge returned, <HI>You say well;</HI> but the King is sworn, the Parliament is sworn, I am sworn, the Justices are sworn, and the Law is preserved by Oaths.</HI> On which <HI>G. F.</HI> told him, <HI>They had had sufficient Ex∣perience of Mens swearing, and had seen how the Justices and Jury swore wrong the other Day:</HI> And continued he, <HI>if thou hast read in the Book of Martyrs, how many of them did refuse to swear, both within the Time of the ten Perse∣cutions, and in Bishop</HI> Bonner's <HI>Day, thou may'st see that to deny swearing in Obedience to Christ's Command, is no new Thing.</HI> To this the Judge said, <HI>He wish'd the Laws were otherwise.</HI> And <HI>G. F.</HI> said then, <HI>Our Yea is Yea, and our Nay is Nay. And if we transgress our</HI> Yea <HI>and our</HI> Nay, <HI>let us suffer as they do, or should do, that swear falsly. This I have offered to the King, and the King said, it was reasonable.</HI> After some farther Discourse, <HI>G. F.</HI> was committed to Prison again, and Colonel <HI>Kirby</HI> order'd the Jailor <HI>to keep him close, and to suffer no Body to come to him, as one that was not fit to be discoursed with.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is re-com∣mitted, and Colonel <HI>Kir∣by</HI>'s Cruelty to him.</NOTE> The Jailor did not scruple to follow this Order, for he lock'd him up in a smoaky Tower, where the Smoke of the other Prisoners came up so thick, that sometimes one could hardly see a burning Candle; so that there seemed to have been an Intent to choke him; for the Turnkey could harldly be persuaded to unlock one of the upper Doors a little to let out the Smoke. Besides this Hardship, in wet Weather it rained in upon his Bed to that Degree, that his Shirt grew wet. In this pitiful Condition he lay during a long cold Winter, which so afflicted him, that his Body swell'd, and his Limbs were much benumbed. Here we will leave him till he was brought again to his Trial, which was not before the next Year.</P>
<P>But before I part with him, I must mention, that some Time before, he had written several Papers to the Emperor, the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and also to the Pope. These Writings were by some Body else turned into <HI>Latin,</HI> and so given out in Print. In these he levell'd chiefly against Persecution for Religion's Sake. He reproved the King of <HI>Spain</HI> more especially, because of the Inquisition, and the burning of Peo∣ple: And he did not spare the Pope, as being the Spring of these E∣vils, saying, <HI>Innocent Blood hath long cry'd for Vengeance to the Lord: The Earth almost swims with innocent Blood; and the Cry of it is heard. Your fro∣zen, Profession, and your cold Winter-Images being set up in your Streets, the Lord God of Power and Dread, and of Heaven and Earth will be avenged on thee, and you all; his Day is approaching. Ye great and rich Cardinals and Pope, ye have been fed like fat Hogs; and seeing that thou would'st not receive the Lord's Messengers, but threw them in Prison, and in your Inquisition, it may be the Lord may give you a Visit another Way, for his Dread is gone out, and his Zeal is kindled against you.— The Fields are sprinkled with Blood of the Innocent, and ye are the Aceldama, or the Field of Blood. But the Lord is coming to take Vengeance upon you; his Hand is stretched over your Heads, and his Power is gone over you; with that he will rule you and smite you down, and bring you that are lofty from your S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ats, and abase your Pride, and take the Glory to himself.— How much Blood, which is unmeasurable, and can't be measured here, have ye drank since the Days of the Apostles, and made your selves drunk with it! But now is the Indignation and Wrath of the Al∣mighty come and coming upon you; and thou Pope must feel it.— Tremble therefore, thou Pope, tremble, fear, and quake thou Pope, tremble ye Cardinals, tremble ye Jesuits, tremble ye Priors, tremble ye Monks and Friars, of what Rank soever; for the Army of the Lord God is coming over you, by whom ye shall be shaken and dashed to Pieces.</HI> These are but small Sparkles of that Flame which <HI>G. Fox</HI> blew against the Pope, intermixing his Writings with many Demonstrations, that the <HI>Romish</HI> Church was the Whore of
<PB N="394" REF="003104_0405_0FEFF6EBD23CF200"/>
<HI>Babel,</HI> and that she it was that had defiled her self with Idolatry and Superstition, and had bathed her self in the Blood of the Saints, having furiously attacked them with Sword and Fire. This he concluded with these Words: <HI>The Plagues of God will be thy Portion, O Pope, who hath de∣ceived the Nations: And all ye Jesuits and Cardinals, howl, for your Misery is coming, the mighty Day of the Lord God upon you all; the Lord God, who will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth, and with none of your Inventions.</HI> Thus <HI>G. Fox</HI> wrote in that Day to the Pope and his Counsellors; and no Wonder that he paid dear for this sharp Language against the Head of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> for it may be believed, that a great many of the Court-party, in those Days, were either conceal'd <HI>Papists,</HI> or Fa∣vourers of them: And yet among the national Clergy, and even those of other Persuasions, many branded the <HI>Quakers</HI> with the odious Name of <HI>secret Papists,</HI> thereby to make them incur the Hatred of the People.</P>
<P>Now I return to <HI>Francis Howgil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">F. Howgil<HI>'s Trial at</HI> Ap∣pleby, <HI>and Re-commit∣ment.</HI></NOTE> whom in the foregoing Year we left in Prison at <HI>Appleby.</HI> It was in the Forepart of this Year that he was brought to his Trial. Being come into Court before the Judges sat, he spoke to the Clerk of the Assizes, and told him, <HI>He did not know whe∣ther they expected his Appearance then or not:</HI> The Clerk said, <HI>You have done well,</HI> and that he would acquaint the Judge, and he should only engage to him to appear the next Assizes, to answer the Indictment against him, and that he should not appear in Court; <HI>Francis</HI> bid do what he would. In the mean Time Sir <HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> (so called) a great Adver∣sary to the Truth, and the great and chief Prosecutor of <HI>Francis,</HI> had in∣formed the Judges against him, <HI>as that he was a dangerous Person, a Ringleader and a Keeper up of Meetings of dangerous Consequence, and destructive to the Peace of the Nation;</HI> so then they concluded he should appear in Court; and so the Clerk informed him, and told him about what Time he should be called: So the Court began; Judge <HI>Twisden</HI> gave the Charge to the Grand Jury, in which he said, <HI>There was a Sort of People, who un∣der Pretence of Conscience and Religion, who seemed to build upon the King's Declarations from</HI> Breda, <HI>and under Colour of this, hatched Treasons and Re∣bellions,</HI> and gave the Jury Charge to enquire and present such, that the Peace of the Nation might be preserved; so they empannelled the Jury, and <HI>Francis</HI> was called to the Bar, and the Judge spake as follow∣eth;</P>
<P>Judge, speaking calmly to him, said, <HI>The Face of Things was much al∣tered since the last Assizes,</HI> and made a large Speech to him and the Coun∣try, telling him, <HI>That all Sects under Pretence of Conscience did violate the Laws, and hatched Rebellions, not</HI> (saith he) <HI>that I have any thing to charge you with; but seeing the Oath of Allegiance was tender'd to you the last Assizes, and you refused to take it, it was looked upon that such Persons were Enemies to the King and Government;</HI> and said, <HI>I will not trouble you now to answer to your Indictment, but I must do that the next Assizes, in the mean Time you must enter into Recognizance for your good Behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>F. H.</HI> answered, I desire Liberty to speak; which he had without Interruption, and said as followeth;</P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> Judge <HI>Twisden,</HI> thou very well knowest upon how slender an Account, or none, I was brought before thee the last Assizes, where thou wert pleased to tender me the Oath of Allegiance, tho' I believe both thee and the rest of the Court did know it was a received Principle amongst us not to swear at all; many Reasons I gave thee then, many more I have to add, if I may have Audience; for it may appear to you an absurd Thing, and Obstinacy in me to refuse it, if I should not ren∣der a Reason; I am (said he) none of those that make Religion a Cloak of Maliciousness, nor Conscience a Cloak to carry on Plots or Conspi∣racies, the Lord hath redeemed me and many more out of such Things;
<PB N="395" REF="003104_0406_0FEFF732A82C7450"/>
and seeing I am engaged to appear at the next Assizes, I desire no far∣ther Thing may be required of me.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>You must enter into Bond this dangerous Time, and therefore consider of it, and tell me now, or before the Assizes end.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Day of the Assizes he was called again.</P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> Seeing thou art pleased to let me answer to my Indictment, which I am willing to do, I have been of good Behaviour, and shall so continue; but it seems a hard Thing to me, and full of Severity, that seeing I am obliged to appear to answer an Indictment of so high a Nature (if prosecuted against me) which tends to the Loss of my Li∣berty for Life, and my Estate for ever, I hope the Court will not envy my Liberty for five Months.</P>
<P>Judge <HI>Turner</HI> said, <HI>We do not desire your Imprisonment, if you will be of good Behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>F. H.</HI> pressed further that they would not put him upon giving Bond to be of good Behaviour, knowing himself to be bound by the Truth, that he could not mis-behave himself.</P>
<P>One <HI>Daniel Flemming,</HI> another persecuting Justice, had framed ano∣ther Indictment against him for meeting, and stood up (fearing the Snare of giving Bond would not hold) and said as followeth;</P>
<P>D. Flemming, <HI>My Lord, he is a great Speaker, it may be the</HI> Quakers <HI>cannot want him.</HI></P>
<P>Judge. <HI>Let him be what he will if he will enter into Bond.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> Said, he had nothing to accuse himself of, for his Conscience bore him Witness that he loved Peace, and sought it with all Men.</P>
<P>Judges both spake, <HI>What do you tell of Conscience? we meddle not with it, but you contemn the Laws, and keep up great Meetings, and go not to Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> We are fallen in a sad Age, if meeting together peaceably, without Arms, or Force, or Intention of Hurt to any Man, but only to worship God in Spirit, and exhort one another to Righteousness, and to pray together in the Holy Ghost, as the primitive Christians of old, that this should be reckoned Breach of Peace and Mis-behaviour.</P>
<P>Judge Twisden. <HI>Do you compare these Times with them? They were</HI> Hea∣thens <HI>that persecuted, but we are</HI> Christian <HI>Magistrates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> It is a Doctrine always held by us, and a received Principle as any Thing we believe, that Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Kingdom could not be set up with carnal Weapons, nor the Gospel propagated by Force of Arms, nor the Church of God built with Violence, but the Prince of Peace was mani∣fested amongst us, and we could learn War no more, but could love Enemies, and forgive the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that did Evil to us.</P>
<P><HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> stood up, and said, <HI>My Lord, we have been remiss to∣wards this People, and have striven with them, and put them in Prison again and again, and fined them, and as soon as they are out, they meet again.</HI></P>
<P>Then stood up <HI>John Louther,</HI> called a Justice, and said, <HI>My Lord, they grow insolent, notwithstanding all Laws, and the Execution of them, yet they grow upon us, and their Meetings are dangerous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip Musgrave</HI> stood up, and produced a Paper (and Justice <HI>Flem∣ming,</HI> so called, seconded him) in great Capital Letters, and gave it the Judge; he told the Judge, <HI>That it hapned some</HI> Quakers <HI>were sent to Pri∣son, and one of them died at</HI> Lancaster, <HI>and they carried his Corps thro' the Country, and set that Paper upon his Coffin,</HI> This is the Body of such an one, who was persecuted by <HI>Daniel Flemming</HI> till Death.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>We have spent much Time with you, I will discourse no more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> I acknowledge your Moderation towards me, allowing me Li∣berty to speak, I shall not trouble you much longer; I shall be wil∣ling
<PB N="396" REF="003104_0407_0FEFF6EE1C27C380"/>
to appear to answer to the Indictment at the Assizes, and in the mean Time to live peaceably and quietly, as I have done, if that will satisfy.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>You must enter into Bond to come at no more Meetings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> I cannot do that, if I should, I were treacherous to God and my own Conscience, and the People and you would but judge me a Hypocrite.</P>
<P>They were loth to commit him, yet at last they did.</P>
<P>This was in the latter Part of the Month call'd <HI>March,</HI> and he was kept about five Months as before, in a bad Room, and none suffered to speak with him, but who got secretly to him without the Jailor's Know∣ledge.</P>
<P>It was about this Time, that <HI>John Audland</HI> departed this Life. He and his Bosom Friend, <HI>John Camm</HI> (whose Decease was some Years be∣fore) had travelled much together in the Ministry of the Gospel; there∣fore I will give an uninterrupted Relation of their latter End, but first that of <HI>John Camm.</HI></P>
<P>He was of a very good Parentage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A short Ac∣count of the Life and Death of <HI>J. Camm.</HI></NOTE> born at <HI>Camsgil,</HI> in the Barony of <HI>Kendal</HI> in <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> which Seat had been possessed by his Ancestors long before him. From his Childhood he was inclined to be religious, and seeking after the best Things, he joined with those that were the most strict in performing religious Duties. And having afterwards heard <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he embraced as Truth the Doctrine he preached, and growing up in it, he himself became an eminent Minister of the Gospel among those called <HI>Quakers.</HI> He and his Bosom-Friend <HI>John Audland</HI> were the First of that Society who preached at <HI>Bristol;</HI> where having been in the Meetings of the <HI>Baptists</HI> and <HI>Independents,</HI> they also had Meetings in several Places without the City; where there was a great Concourse of People, and many received their Doctrine. Since that Time, these two Ministers travelled much together, and many were convinced by their Ministry. But at length <HI>John Camm,</HI> who did not spare himself, began to fall under a kind of Consumption, insomuch that thro' Weakness he was fain to stay at home; and then he often called his Children and Family together, exhorting them to Godliness, and praying to the Lord for them. Some Weeks before his Death, he once expressed himself thus; <HI>How great a Benefit do I enjoy above many, having such a large Time of Preparation for Death, being daily dying, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for ever with my God, in that Kingdom that is unspeakably full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.

<P>His beloved Friend <HI>John Audland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">As also of <HI>John Aud∣land.</HI></NOTE> (who often bemoaned the Loss of so dear a Companion) died also of a kind of Consumption: For his
<PB N="397" REF="003104_0408_0FEFF734E8624990"/>
ardent Zeal made him strain his Voice beyond what his Body was well able to bear. In a Meeting which he once had with <HI>J. Camm</HI> in a Field without <HI>Bristol,</HI> where <HI>Charles Marshal</HI> was one of his Auditors, after <HI>J. Camm</HI> had left off speaking, he stood up with an awful and shining Countenance, and lifting up his Voice as a Trumpet, he said, <HI>I proclaim a spritual War with the Inhabitants of the Earth, who are in the Fall and Se∣paration from God, and I prophesy to the Four Winds of Heaven.</HI> Thus he went on with mighty Power, exhorting to Repentance; and spoke with such a piercing Authority, that some of the Auditory fell on the Ground, and cried out under the Sense of their Transgression. And when at <HI>Bristol,</HI> he many Times preached in an Orchard to a great Mul∣titude, he would lift his Voice up exceedingly, in order to be heard by all. Thus he spent his natural Strength, tho' he was but a young Man. About the twentieth Year of his Age he married with one <HI>Anne Newby</HI> of <HI>Kendal,</HI> a virtuous Maid, not only of good Family, but also excelling in Piety, and therefore she freely gave him up to travel in the Service of the Gospel, notwithstanding his Company was very dear to her; which made her say, <HI>That she believed few ever enjoyed a greater Blessing in a Husband so kind and affectionate.</HI> And how heartily and tenderly she loved him, may be seen by the following Letter she writ to him;</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Husband,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOƲ art dearer to me, than ever: My Love flows out to thee, even the same Love that I am loved withal of my Father, in that Love Salute me to all my Friends, for dear you are all unto me, my Life is much refreshed in hearing from you. I received thy Letters, and all my Soul desireth, is, to hear from thee in the Life. Dear Heart, in Life dwell, there I am with thee out of all Time, out of all Words, in the pure Power of the Lord, there is my Joy and Strength: 0! how am I refreshed to hear from thee, to hear of thy Faithfulness and Boldness in the Work of the Lord. 0! Dear Heart, I cannot utter the Joy I have concerning thee; thy Presence I have continually in Spirit, therewith am I filled with Joy, all Glory and Honour be to our God for ever, O! blessed be the Day in which thou wast born, that thou art found worthy to labour in the Work of the Word: Surely the Lord hath found thee faithful in a little, there∣fore he hath committed much unto thee; go on in the Name and Power of the Lord Jesus Christ, from whence all Strength cometh, to whom be all Glory and Honour for ever. O! dear Heart, go on, conquering and to conquer, knowing this, that thy Crown is sure. So, dear Heart, now is the Time of the Lord's Work, and few are willing to go forth into it, all the whole World lieth in Wickedness, doing their own Work; but blessed be the Lord for ever who hath called us from doing our own Work into his great Work. O! Marvellous are his Works, and his Ways past finding out. O! dear Heart, thou knowest my Heart; thou may'st read <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ily how that I rejoyce in nothing more than in thy Prosperity in the Work of the Lord: Oh! It is past my Ʋtterance to express the Joy I have for thee. I am full, I am full of Love towards thee, never such Love as this; the mighty Power of the Lord go along with thee, and keep thee faithful, and valiant, and bold in his pure Counsel, to stand single out of all the World. Oh! dear Heart, all my Love to thee is purer than Gold seven Times purified in the Fire: Oh! pure is he that hath loved us, therefore let Purity and Holiness cover us for ever: A joyful Word it was to me to hear that thou wast moved to go for <HI>Bristol:</HI> Oh! my own Heart, my own Life in that which now stands, act and obey, that thou may'st stand upon thy alone Guard; so dear Heart, let thy Prayers be for me, that I may be kept pure, out of all Tempta∣tions, singly to dwell in the Life.

By this letter it appears, that there was an endeared mutual Love between this virtuous Couple. He was a Man of great Knowledge, but when his Understanding came to be opened by the preaching at <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he would say sometimes, <HI>Ah, what have
we been doing! or what availeth our great Profession? All our Building tumbles down; our Profession is high as the Wind; the Day of the Lord is upon it, and his Word as a Fire consumes it as dry Stubble; and puts an End to all empty Professions and high Notions, without Life or Substance; to all the Wisdom of fallen Man. We must forsake the World, and all its Glory; it is all but Vanity and Vexation of Spirit: It is a Saviour that I long for, it is him that my Soul pants after. O that I may be gathered into his Life, and overshadowed with his Glory, sanctified through out by his Word, and raised up by his eternal Power!</HI> He continuing in this State of daily Supplication and inward Travel of Soul, it pleased the Lord at length to furnish him with an extraordinary Qualification to proclaim his Word, which he did some Years faithfully and with great Zeal. And tho' his Wife loved him dearly, and preferred his Company above what the World could give, yet in Regard of his Gospel Service, she gave him up freely to be much from home; where∣by during a great Part of the Time of their Marriage, she had not his desirable Company. In the mean while he laboured diligently in the Lord's Harvest, till his bodily Strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailing, and meeting with hard Imprisonments, he was seized with a most violent Cough, which was followed by a Fever, so that his Sleep was taken from him, which made him grow very weak; but he bore his Sickness with great Patience; and said once, <HI>That in those great Meetings in the Orchard at</HI> Bristol <HI>he often forgot himself, not considering the Inability of his Body, from a Desire to be heard by all: But that his Reward was with him, and be content to be with the Lord, which his Soul valued above all Things.</HI> Not long before his De∣parture, being visited by some of his Friends, he spoke to comfortably, and with such Power, as one that was beyond the feeling of his Weak∣ness. To his Wife, who was big with Child, and nigh her Delivery, and well knowing how tenderly she loved him, he said, <HI>My Will is in true Subjection submitting to the Will of the Lord, whether Life or Death; and therefore give me up freely to his disposing.</HI> And she, how dear soever he was to her, did so; which gave him some Ease, seeing her sincere Resignedness; and being sometimes overcome with Joy, he praised God in his Sickness; nay so ardent was his Zeal, that once, tho' very weak, he desired to be helped up in Bed upon his Knees; and thus he fer∣vently supplicated
the Lord in the Behalf of his Churches, <HI>That they might be preserved in the Truth, out of the Evil of the World, and that his Gospel might spread, and be published to the gathering of all that pertain to</HI> Israel. His Strength now diminishing daily, he sweetly departed at the Age of thirty four Years, about three Weeks after the Fever first sei∣zed him. And his Widow, who ten Days after his Decease was deli∣vered of a Son, behaved her self discreetly, and said afterwards in a Paper concerning him; <HI>The eternal God, who by his Providence joined us to∣gether in Marriage in our young Days, in his blessed Counsel also caused his Day to spring from on high upon us: In the marvellous Light, and bright shi∣ning whereof, he revealed his Son Christ in us, and gave us Faith to believe in him the eternal Lord of Life, by which our Souls came to be quickened and made alive in him; and also in and by the quickning of his holy Power, we were made one in a spiritual and heavenly Relation, our Hearts being knit to∣gether in the unspeakable Love of Truth, which was our Life, Joy, and De∣light, and made our Days together exceeding comfortable, as being that whereby all our temporal Enjoyments were sanctified, and made a Blessing to us — How hard it was, and how great a Loss, to part with so dear and tender an Husband as he was to me, as far beyond what I can express; the Dolour of my Heart, my
<PB N="399" REF="003104_0410_0FEFF7385B9FE258"/>
Tongue or Pen is not able to declare. Yet on this I contented my self that it was the Will of the Lord, that he was taken from the Evil; and that my Loss tho' great, was not to be compared to his eternal Gain.</HI> This Widow, married in Process of Time with <HI>Thomas Camm,</HI> Son of <HI>John Camm,</HI> her former Husband's Bosom Friend. She was indeed a Woman of great Vertue: But now I part with her, with Intention to say more of her, when I shall come to the Time of her Decease.</P>
<P>I return again to <HI>Francis Howgil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. Howgil</HI> brought again to his Trial.</NOTE> whom we left in Prison, and who now appeared again at the Assizes, which were holden at <HI>Appleby</HI> in the Month called <HI>August.</HI> And he having got Liberty to speak with the Clerk of the Assizes, who told him, <HI>That he must prepare himself to come to a Trial,</HI> answered, <HI>He was prepared, but thought that all be could say, would little avail, he believing they purposed to persecute him with all Severity.</HI> Which proved so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Judge it beforehand incensed a∣gainst him.</NOTE> as will appear by what follows; for the County-Justices had incensed the Judges against him before-hand. Yet <HI>Howgil</HI> endeavoured all he could to convince them of his Innocency; and to that End drew up the Substance of the Oath into several Heads, which he could subscribe to; to this he joined another Paper to Judge <HI>Turner,</HI> shewing the Cause of his first Commitment, and the former Proceedings against him; and <Q>how unequal it was to prosecute him upon a Sta∣tute made against Popish Recusants. He also signified in that Paper, that he was a Man of a tender Spirit, and feared the Lord from a Child, and had never taken any Oath but once in his Life, which was twenty Years ago; and that his refusing to take the Oath of Al∣legiance was not in any evil Intent to the King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Person or Govern∣ment, but meerly upon a consciencious Account; and that he could not swear, being otherwise perswaded of the Lord, seeing it was against the Command of Christ and the Apostle <HI>James</HI>'s Doc∣trine. Besides, that he was able to make it evident to be against the Example of the primitive Christians for divers hundred Years, and so no new Opinion. That he did neither in Wilfulness nor Ob∣stinacy refuse it, being sensible of the Damage that would come thereby, if they did prosecute him upon that Statute, he having a Wife and Children, and some small Estate which he knew lay at Stake in the Matter; but that tho' it were his Life also, he could not revolt from, or deny that which he had most certainly believed in: But if any could convince him, either by Scripture or Reason, he had an Ear to hear. And therefore all those Things considered, he desired he might be dismiss'd from his Bonds, and from their Per∣secution of him upon that Account.</Q> These Papers were delivered to the Judges and Justices before he appeared in Court; and were read by them. He then being called to the Bar at the Assizes holden at <HI>Appleby</HI> Judge <HI>Turner</HI> said to him, <HI>Here is an Indictment against you for refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance; so you must plead to it either Guilty or Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> With a Heart girded up with Strength and Courage said, Judge <HI>Turner,</HI> May I have Liberty to speak, and make my Defence, for I have none to plead my Cause, but the Lord?</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>You may,</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> I will lay the true State of my Case before thee, and of the Proceedings against me, from the first, seeing Judge <HI>Twisden</HI> is not here, who had Knowledge of all the Proceedings hitherto. I am a Country∣man, born and brought up in this Country; my Carriage and Conver∣sation is known, how I have walked peaceably towards all Men, as I hope my Country-men can testify. About a Year ago being at my neighbouring Market-Town about my reasonable and lawful Occasions, I was sent for by an high Constable out of the Market to the Justices
<PB N="400" REF="003104_0411_0FEFF6F4B8F36820"/>
of Peace, before whom I went; and when I came there, they had no∣thing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay to my Charge, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to ask me Questions to ensnare me about our Meetings; and when they could find no Occasion, they seemed to tender the <HI>Oath of Allegiance</HI> to me, tho' they never read it to me, neither did I positively deny it, yet they committed me to Prison; and so I was brought hither to this Assize, and then the <HI>Mittimus</HI> by which I was committed, was called for, and the Judge read it, and said to the Justices, it was insufficient: Nevertheless Judge <HI>Twisden</HI> tender'd the Oath of Obedience to me; many Things I did alledge then, and many more I have to say now, if Time will permit: From that Time I was under an Engagement to appear at the next Assize, and so was cal∣led, and did appear at the last Jail-delivery, and a farther Obligation was required o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me for good Behaviour, which I could not do, lest I should be brought into a farther Snare; and since that Time I have been committed Prisoner these five Months, some of which Time I have been kept under great Restraint, my Friends not permitted to speak to me; and thus briefly I have given thee an Account hitherto. And as to the Oath, the Substance thereof, with the Representation of my Case, is presented unto the Court already, unto which I have set my Hand, and also shall in those Words testify the same in open Court, if re∣quir'd; and seeing it is the very Substance the Law doth require, I de∣sire it may be accepted, and I cleared from my Imprisonment.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>I am come to execute the Law, and the Law requires an Oath, and I cannot alter it; do you think the Law must be changed for you, or only for a few; if this be suffered, the Administration of Justice is hindered, no Action can be tried, nor Evidence given for the King, nor no other particular Cases can be tried; and your Principles are altogether inconsistent with the Law and Government; I pray you shew me which Way we shall proceed, shew me some Reason, and give me some Ground.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> said, I shall: In the Mouth of two or three Witnesses every Truth is confirm'd; and we never denied to give, and still are ready to give Evidence for the King wherein we are concern'd, and in any other Matter for the ending of Strife between Man and Man in Truth and Righteousness, and this answers the Substance of the Law.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>Is this a good Answer, think you? whether to be given with or with∣out Oath? The Law requires an Oath.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> Still Evidence is and may be given in Truth, according to the Substance of the Law, so that no Detriment cometh unto any Party, seeing that true Testimony may be born without an Oath; and I did not speak of changing the Law: Yet seeing we never refused giving Te∣stimony, which answereth the Intent and Substance of the Law, I judg∣ed it was reasonable to receive our Testimony, and not to expose us to such Sufferings, seeing we scrupled an Oath only upon a consciencious Account, in Tenderness of our Consciences, for Fear of breaking the Command of Christ, the Saviour of the World, which if we do, there is none of you able to plead our Cause for us with him.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>But why do you not go to Church, but meet in Houses and private Conventicles, which the Law forbids.</HI></P>
<P><HI>F. H.</HI> We meet together only for the Worship of the true God in Spirit and Truth, having the primitive Christians for our Example, and to no other End, but that we may be edified, and God glorified, and when two or three are met together in the Name of Christ, and he in the midst of them, there is a Church.</P>
<P>Judge. <HI>That is true: But how long is it since you have been at Church? Or will you go to the Church the Law doth allow of? Give me some Reasons why you do not go.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Clerk, read it.</HI></P>
<P>So he read it: How that <HI>F. H.</HI> had wilfully, obstinately, and con∣temptuously denied to swear when the Oath was tendered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>What do you deny?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Indictment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Did you not deny to swear? and the Indictment convicts you that you did not swear.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I gave unto the Court the Substance of the Oath, as you all know <HI>2dly,</HI> I told you I did not deny it out of Obstinacy or Wil∣fulness neither in Contempt of the King's Law or Government; for my Will would rather choose my Liberty, than Bonds; and I am sen∣sible it is like to be a great Damage to me; I have a Wife and Chil∣dren, and some Estate, which we might subsist upon, and do Good to others, and I know all this lies at Stake; but if it were my Life also, I durst not but do as I do, lest I should incur the Displeasure of God; and do you judge I would lose my Liberty wilfully, and suffer the Spoiling of my Estate, and the ruining of my Wife and Children in Obstinacy and Wilfulness? Sure nay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Jury, You see he denies the Oath, and he will not plead to the In∣dictment, only excepts against it because of the Form of Words; but you see he will not swear, and yet he saith he denies the Indictment, and you see upon what Ground.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>And then they called the Jailor to witness and swear, that the last Assizes <HI>F. H.</HI> did refuse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he did; and the Jury, without go∣ing from the Bar, gave in their Verdict, Guilty, and then the Court broke up that Night.</P>
<P>The next Day towards Evening, when they had tried all the Prison∣ers, <HI>Francis</HI> was brought to the Bar to receive his Sentence.</P>
<P>Judge stood up, and said, <HI>Come, the Indictment is proved against you, what have you to say why Sentence shall not be given?</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have many Things to say, if you will hear them: <HI>1st,</HI> As I have said, I denied not out of Obstinacy or Wilfulness, but was willing to testify the Truth in this Matter of Obedience, or any other Matter wherein I was concerned: <HI>Secondly,</HI> Because Swearing was directly against the Command of Christ. <HI>3dly,</HI> Against the Doctrine of the Apo∣stle. <HI>4thly,</HI> Even some of your principal Pillars of the Church of <HI>Eng∣and;</HI> as Bishop <HI>Ʋsher,</HI> some Time Primate of <HI>Ireland,</HI> he said in his Works, <HI>The</HI> Waldenses <HI>did deny all swearing in their Age, from that Com∣mand of Christ and the Apostle</HI> James, <HI>and it was a sufficient Ground;</HI> and Dr. <HI>Gauden,</HI> late Bishop of <HI>Exeter,</HI> in a Book of his I lately read, he cited very many ancient Fathers, to shew, that the first three hundred
<PB N="402" REF="003104_0413_0FEFF6F6F2CD8228"/>Years Christians did not swear, so that it is no new Doctrine.</P>
</SP>
<P>To which the Court seemed to give a little Ear, and said nothing, but talked one to another, and <HI>Francis</HI> stood silent, and then the Judge said,</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sure you mistake.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not the Books here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Will you say upon your honest Word they denied all Swearing?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I have said is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why do you not come to Church, and bear Service, and be subject to the Law, and to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are subject, and for that Cause we do pay Taxes, Tribute and Custom, <HI>and give unto</HI> Caesar <HI>the Things that are his, and unto God the Things that are his,</HI> to wit, Worship, Honour and Obedience; and if thou mean the Parish-Assembly, I tell thee faithfully, I am persuaded, and upon good Ground, their Teachers are not the Ministers of Christ, neither their Worship the Worship of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why; it may be for some small Things in the Service, you reject it all.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, it is manifest they are Time-servers, one while preaching up that for Divine Service to People that another while they cry down, as Popish, Superstitious and Idolatrous; and that which they have preached up twenty Years together, make Shipwreck of all in a Day, and now again call it divine, and would have all compelled to that themselves once made void.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why; never since the King came in.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the same Men that preached it down once, now cry it up; so they are so unstable and wavering, that we cannot believe they are the Ministers of Christ. <HI>Secondly,</HI> They teach for Hire, and live by forced Maintenance, and would force a Faith upon Men, contrary to Christ and the Apostle's Rule, who would have every one perswaded in their own Minds, and said, <HI>Whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin,</HI> and yet they say, <HI>Faith is the Gift of God,</HI> and we have no such Faith given; but yet they would force theirs upon us, and because we cannot re∣ceive it, they cry, <HI>You are not subject to Authority and the Laws,</HI> and no∣thing but Confiscations, Imprisonment and Banishment is threatned, and this is their greatest Plea, I could mention more Particulars.— Then the Judge interrupted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, I see you will not swear, nor conform, nor be subject, and you think we deal severely with you, but if you would be subject, we should not need.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do so judge indeed, that you deal severely with us for Obe∣dience to the Commands of Christ; I pray thee, canst thou shew me how that any of those People for whom the Act was made, have been proceeded aginst by this Statute, tho' I envy no Man's Liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Oh, Yes, I can instance you many up and down the Country that are premunired, I have done it my self, pronounced Sentence against divers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What against Papists?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, against the <HI>Quakers?</HI> so I have heard indeed; so then that Statute which was made against Papists, thou' let'st them alone, and executest it against the <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, You will meet in great Numbers, and do increase, but there is a new Statute which will make you fewer.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if we must suffer, it is for Christ's Sake, and for well-doing.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Francis</HI> then being silent, the Judge pronounced the Sentence, but spake so low, that the Prisoner tho' near to him, could scarce hear it.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="003104_0414_0FEFF73C6857AEB8"/>The Sentence was, <HI>You are put out of the King's Protection and the Benefit of the Law, your Lands are confiscate to the King during your Life; and your Goods and Chattels for ever, and you to be Prisoner during your Life.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hard sentence for my Obedience to the Commands of Christ; the Lord forgive you all.</P>
</SP>
<P>So he turned from the Bar; but the Judge speaking, he turned again, and many more Words passed to the same Purpose, as before; at last the judge rose up and said,</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Judge.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, If you will yet be subject to the Laws, the King will shew you Mercy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. H.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lord hath shewed Mercy unto me, and I have done no∣thing against the King, nor Government, nor any Man, blessed be the Lord, and therein stands my Peace; for it is for Christ's Sake suffer, and not for Evil-doing. And so the Court broke up. The People were generally moderate, and many were sorry to see what was done against him; but <HI>Francis</HI> signified how contented and glad he was, that he had any Thing to lose for the Lord's precious Truth, of which he had publickly born Testimony, and that he was now counted worthy to suffer for it.</P>
</SP>
<P>This he did chearfully,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He dies in Bonds, after four Years Im∣prisonment.</NOTE> and died in Bonds after above four Years Imprisonment, as may be related in its due Time. He was a Man of Learning, and a great Writer among his Fellow-Believers; insomuch that during his Confinement he writ not only several edifying Epistles to exhort them to Constancy and Stedfastness in the Doctrine of Truth, but also some Books to refute the Opposers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>We have here seen how the Judge said, <HI>There is a new Statute which will make you fewer.</HI> This Statute bore the Title of <HI>An Act to prevent and suppress seditious Conventicles.</HI> And tho' the Act made two Years be∣fore did extend to Banishment, yet that Punishment was renewed, and expressed more at large in this, which was as followeth;</P>
<Q><P>WHEREAS an Act made in the Five and thirtieth Year of the Reign of our late Sovereign Lady Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> intituled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act to prevent and suppress sedi∣tious Conven∣ticles.</NOTE> <HI>An Act to retain the Queen's Majesties Subjects in their due Obedience,</HI> hath not been put in due Execution by reason of some Doubt of late made, Whether the said Act be still in Force? altho' it be very clear and evident, And it is hereby declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">35 El. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. declared to be in force.</NOTE> That the said Act is still in Force, and ought to be put in due Execution:</P>

<P>A learned Man at <HI>London,</HI> of what Persuasion I know not, put forth a little Book in Relation to this Act, wherein he shewed from the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> the Absurdity of it, since all religious Acts exercised by six Persons, not according to the Formality of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> were forbidden; and that at this Rate it might be reckon'd a Trans∣gression, if a Woman being in Travel, and in Danger of Life, one of the Company said a Prayer; or if any one spoke something to com∣fort the near Relations of a deceased Person; or prayed for the Health or Happiness of a young married Couple, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which it might hap∣pen, that some by the Malice of their Enemies, might not only incur Imprisonment for three Months, but also by Virtue of the Act of Ba∣nishment, might be condemned to Transportation. That this was not without Danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgeman's</HI> Advice to a Jury on the Act.</NOTE> did appear sufficiently by what Judge <HI>Orlando Bridge∣man</HI> said at <HI>Hertford</HI> to the Jury, viz. <HI>You are not to expect a plain punctual Evidence against them for any Thing they said or did at their Meeting; for they may speak to one another, tho' not with or by auricular Sound, but by a Cast of the Eye, or a Motion of the Head or Foot, or Gesture of the Body. So that if you find or believe in your Hearts that they were in the Meeting under Colour of Religion in their Way, tho' they sat still only and lookt upon each other, it was an unlawful Meeting.</HI> At this Rate the Jury-men, who ought to be impartial Judges, or Mediators, were swayed, so that with∣out Fear they might find the <HI>Quakers</HI> that were met together, guilty of transgressing the Law.</P>
<P>Now since at that Time they were resolved to banish the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, <HI>George Whitehead</HI> publish'd a little Book, in which he shewed the Unreasonableness of the Persecutors, and also strengthened his Friends
<PB N="410" REF="003104_0421_0FEFF702F8984FD0"/>
with solid Arguments against the Charge of Sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neckedness, answering some specious Objections; among the rest, <Q>That the <HI>Quakers</HI> might keep small Meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. White∣head</HI> writes against Perse∣cution.</NOTE> and so not fall under the Lash of the Law; for if they did not meet above five in Number, they kept without the Reach of the Law; and by keeping private Meetings, they might al∣so acquit their Consciences before God.</Q> But to this <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> an∣swered, <HI>That it might have been objected to the Prophet</HI> Daniel, <HI>that he might have prayed secretly, and not with open Windows and thrice a Day, after king</HI> Darius <HI>had signed the Decree,</HI> That whosoever should ask a Petition of any God or Man for thirty Days, save of the King, he should be cast into the Den of Lions;<HI>but that</HI> Daniel, <HI>notwithstanding this Decree, had continued to pray to God as before. Since then,</HI> said G. Whitehead, <HI>our Meetings are kept in Obedience to the Lord God, and according to the Freedom he hath given us, we may not leave off our Testimony for God in that Case; but we must be faithful to him, whatever we suffer on that Account. For neither the Threatnings of Men, nor their Severity or Cruelty acted against us, how far soever it may be extended, can make us to forsake the Lord in not keeping our Assemblies, or to be ashamed of Christ before Men, lest hereafter he be ashamed of us before His Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Besides he shewed, <HI>How unrea∣sonable it was to incite the Jury on an ill-grounded Suspicion, without leaving them the Liberty of their own Judgment:</HI> And the Judges he shewed <HI>their Duty from the Law, and</HI> Magna Charta. He also shewed <HI>how unequal it was, that Soldiers, who abused his Friends in their Meetings, should be called as Witnesses against them; and that they should be lock'd up with Thieves and Fe∣lons, since this was contrary to the Right of a freeborn</HI> Englishman. But this Representation of <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> was slighted, since they were resolved to go on with banishing of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and to transport them to the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> which however, according to the ancient Laws, might not be done to a freeborn <HI>Englishman</HI> against his Mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">As doth also <HI>J. Coale.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Josiah Coale</HI> about this Time gave forth also a Paper, being a Warning to the King and both Houses of Parliament, to dissuade them from Persecution. But this did not avail, for Persecution went on.</P>
<P>In the Month called <HI>August,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trial of 8 Friends at <HI>Hertford.</HI></NOTE> eight of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> viz. <HI>Francis Prior, Nicholas Lucas, Henry Feast, Henry Marshal, Jeremy Hern, Thomas Wood, John Blendale,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Trahern,</HI> were tried at <HI>Hertford</HI> before Judge <HI>Orlando Bridgeman,</HI> already mentioned: The Indictment contained, <HI>That they had been at an unlawful Meeting, under Colour and Pretence of Reli∣gion:</HI> And the Witnesses declared, <HI>That they had met together above the Number of Five, and were taken at such Times, and such Places;</HI> for they must have transgressed thrice before they could be condemned to Banish∣ment: But the Witnesses declared also, <HI>That they neither heard them speak any Words, nor saw them do any thing at their Meeting, but sit still.</HI> The In∣dictment having been delivered to the Grand Jury, they could not agree in their Verdict; for there were some amongst them whose Conscien∣ces would not give them Leave to be accessary to this Work of Perse∣cution; and therefore they brought in their Verdict <HI>Ignoranius.</HI> Now tho' such a Verdict as this ought not to be rejected, yet Judge <HI>Bridge∣man</HI> standing up, and seeming to be angry, spoke to the Jury after this Manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Judge's partial Speeches and Behaviour.</NOTE> <HI>My Masters, what do you mean to do? Will you make a N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of Wax of the Law, and suffer the Law to be baffled? Those that think to deceive the Law, the Law will deceive them. Why don't ye find the Bill?</HI> To which one of the Jury said, <HI>That it concerned them to be wary, and well satisfied in what they did, for they were upon Mens Lives for ought they knew.</HI> No, said the Judge, <HI>I desire not their Lives, but their Reformation:</HI> And then he gave the Jury some Directions, and he so colour'd the Matter, that they going out again, soon returned, and found the Bill. Then Four of the Prisoners were called to the Bar, their Indictment read, and they
<PB N="411" REF="003104_0422_0FEFF749197B6448"/>
ask'd, <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty?</HI> To which they answered, <HI>Not guilty, and that they had transgressed no just Law. But,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>ye have trans∣gressed this Law,</HI> [having the Act in his Hand,] <HI>and ye have been twice convicted already upon Record, and if ye are found guilty by the Jury this Time, I must pass the Sentence of Transportation upon you. Now therefore ye shall see that we do not desire to strain the Law to the highest Severity; neither do I be∣lieve that it was the Aim of the Law-makers, to be severe, but for conforming. If ye will promise that ye will not go, or be at any more such Meetings, I will shew you this Favour, as to acquit you for what is past: This Favour ye may re∣ceive before the Jury is charged with you; but afterwards I cannot do it. And know also, if the Jury for Want of punctual Evidence, should not find you guilty, yet if ye are taken again, ye will be in the same Case ye now are in. What say you? Will ye promise to meet no more?</HI> To this the Prisoners answered, <HI>They could promise no such Thing.</HI> Then a Jury was called, and the In∣dictment read a second Time, containing, <HI>That the Prisoners had been at an unlawfull Meeting at such a Time and Place, the first, second, and third Time.</HI> The Witnesses being called, gave the same Evidence as before; and then the Judge said thus to the Jury, <HI>My Masters, the Jury, ye hear what Evidence the Witnesses give; how they took them at such Times, at such Places, which are Places they use to meet in; and that they were above the Number of Five, besides the Persons of the Family where they met; and that they are twice convicted already upon Record: And this is the third Offence, which incurs the Sentence of Transportation, if ye find them guilty.</HI> Then he spoke those Words which have been mention'd already, viz. <HI>Ye are not to expect a plain punctual Evidence against them for any Thing they said or did at their Meeting,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for dumb Men may speak to one another, so as they may understand each other by Signs: And they themselves say, that the Worship of God is inward, in the Spirit, and that they can discern Spirits, and know one another in Spirit. So that if ye find or believe in your Hearts that they were in the Meeting, under Colour of Religion in their Way, tho' they sat still only — It was an unlawful Meeting, and their Ʋse and Practice not according to the Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England; <HI>for it allows and commands when People meet together in the Church, that Divine Service shall be read,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And ye must find the Bill; for ye must have Respect to the Meaning and Intent of the Law, which the King and Parliament have in Wisdom and Policy made, not only against Conventicles, but the Words</HI> Assembly <HI>and</HI> Meeting <HI>were added; for we have had late Experience of the Danger of such Meetings under Colour of Religion: And it is an easy Matter at such Meetings to conspire and consult Mischief. Therefore the Wisdom and Policy of the King and Parliament, lest they should be undermined, have made this Law, which is not a Law against Conscience, for it doth not touch Conscience at all, as I confess some other Laws do, which enjoin coming to Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four of them by the Judges Management are found guilty, and sentenced to be transport∣ed to <HI>Barba∣does.</HI></NOTE> and some other Things.</HI> This and more Judge <HI>Bridgeman</HI> spoke to the Jury, to perswade them to bring the Pri∣soners in guilty. And the Jury being gone out, and within the Space of an Hour returned, their Foreman said, <HI>That</HI> Nicholas Lucas, <HI>and the other three were guilty.</HI></P>
<P>What the Judge had said, <HI>That they had had late Experience of the Dan∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of such Meetings under Colour of Religion,</HI> was of no Force at all; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> never had appeared that the <HI>Quakers</HI> in religious Meetings did any Thing else than the performing of their Worship, tho there were other Evidences concerning the Fifth-Monarchy-Men; but it was universal∣ly known that the <HI>Quakers</HI> had no Part therein, nor joined with them in the least Degree. It was also a very absurd Saying of the Judge, That <HI>this Law did not touch Conscience;</HI> for it was meerly for Conscience-sake that the <HI>Quakers</HI> frequented not the publick Service and Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and kept religious Meetings by themselves. But the Jury seemed well satisfied with what the Judge had told them;
<PB N="412" REF="003104_0423_0FEFF705E672AE90"/>
and he having thus obtained his Aim, read the Prisoners Names, and said to them, <HI>What can ye say for your selves, that Judgment of Transportation should not pass, or be given against you?</HI> To which they said, <HI>We are in∣nocent, and have transgressed no just Law; if we must have that Sentence, we give up our Bodies freely into the Hands of the Lord; the Will of the Lord be done. Have ye nothing more to say?</HI> said the Judge. <HI>Nothing, but that we are innocent,</HI> replied the Prisoners, <HI>we have wrong'd no Man. Then heark∣en to your Sentence,</HI> said the Judge, <HI>Ye shall be transported beyond the Seas, to the Island of</HI> Barbadoes, <HI>there to remain seven Years.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Jeremiah Hern,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Hern</HI> and <HI>T. Wood</HI> cal∣led to the Bar, and were of∣fered the De∣lay of their Trial till next Assizes, if they would desire it, which they did not.</NOTE> and <HI>Thomas Wood</HI> were called to the Bar, and their Indictment read, to which they pleaded, <HI>Not guilty,</HI> but <HI>innocent;</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> said, <HI>He was no such Person as the Act mentioned, for plotting and contriving Insurrections.</HI> Then the Judge interrupting him, said, <HI>You are a forward Man, you have an Estate;</HI> and so he caused him to be set by: And to <HI>Thomas Wood,</HI> he said, <HI>I hear a good Report of you; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsider what you do; I am sorry, seeing you have a good Report among you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Neighbours, that you should be found guilty, which I fear you will if you put your self upon Trial: I am willing to shew you Favour; and it may be one Man may fare the better for another.</HI> This reflected on <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> who, by the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice of one <HI>John King,</HI> had been falsely represented to the Judge. Yet Je∣remiah having shewn how he had been wrong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, the Judge said, <HI>They should both partake of his Favour, if they would but desire it:</HI> And this Favour consisted in this, as he himself said, <HI>That he would wave the Proceedings of the Court, and give than Time till the next Assizes to consider better with themselves. What say you,</HI> (thus he continued) <HI>will ye have it deferred till the next Assizes? For if the Jury find the Bill, you will be sent to</HI> Jamaica; <HI>ye must not all go to one Place.</HI> To this the Prisoners returned, <HI>We have transgressed no Law of God, nor wronged any Man: We leave it to the Court; we desire it not. If you will not desire it,</HI> replied the Judge, <HI>I cannot, nor will do it.</HI> Then three other Prisoners were brought to the Bar, among whom was one <HI>John Reynolds,</HI> who, according to the Deposition of the Witnesses, had been within a Yard of the Door of the Meeting place, with his Face fromwards it. The Judge then said, <HI>God forbid that I should do any thing that is not right and just against my Conscience; there is that which is written upon the Wall before me, which puts me in Mind, that I should not judge for Man, but for God.</HI> Then turning to the Jury, he spoke to them almost after the same Manner, as he did concerning the other four Prisoners; and to induce them to declare <HI>Reynolds</HI> (who was taken but not in the Meeting) <HI>guilty,</HI> he spoke thus, <Q>Suppose a Man be killed in a House, and no body saw him killed, but a Man is met coming out of the House with a bloody Knife in his Hand, it is a very probable Evidence that he is guilty of the Murder. So tho' the Witnesses do not say that they saw and took him in the Meeting, yet they swore he was within a Yard of the Door with his Face fromwards the Place where they usually met; and he hath been ta∣ken twice already, and convicted upon Record. My Masters, I leave it to you, go forth.</Q> Then a Bailiff was called, and charged to pro∣vide the Jury a Room, and to let none speak with them, nor to let them have either Bread, Drink, or Candle, till they brought in their Verdict. The Jury being gone out, soon agreed, and after they were returned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four of them found guilty, and sentenced to be trans∣ported to <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> but <HI>Reynolds</HI> ac∣quitted.</NOTE> said, <HI>That four of the five Prisoners were guilty, and that the other who stood without the Door was not guilty.</HI> So he was acquitted; but the other four being brought to the Bar, the Judge asked them, <HI>What they could say why Judgment of Transportation should not be given against them?</HI> Their Answer was, <HI>We are innocent, and have not offended any just Law of God or Man, to deserve that Sentence; we leave it to the Witness of God in thy or your Con∣sciences.</HI> Then the Judge said, <HI>Ye have offended against this Law</HI> (having
<PB N="413" REF="003104_0424_0FEFF74ACBF1D4B0"/>
the Act before him) <HI>which is made by the King and Parliament; and execu∣ted by us their subordinate Ministers, if it be not righteous and just, we must an∣swer for that.</HI> One of the Prisoners had said before, <HI>If I have transgres∣sed any just Law, let me suffer; and if not, he that judgeth for God will not condemn me.</HI> To which the Judge returned, <HI>You do well to put me in mind of my Duty; pray think of your own.</HI> And now he asked the Prisoners, <HI>Have you any more to say?</HI> To which they answered, <HI>Nothing, but that we are innocent.</HI> Then he said, <HI>Hear your Sentence;</HI> <Q>You shall be transport∣ed beyond the Seas, to the Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> being one of his Ma∣jesty's foreign Plantations, there to remain seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ars. Now, I have this one thing to acquaint you with, That if y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and either of you, will pay down here into the Court, an hundred Pounds before the Court riseth, you and every one of you shall be discharged, and clear∣ly acquitted for what is past. And I will shew you this Favour, as not to discharge the Court at this present, but shall adjourn it till Afternoon.</Q> This was done; and the Court being met again, the Judge sent to the condemn'd Prisoners to know if they would pay down the Hundred Pounds; but they answering <HI>No,</HI> the Court was then soon discharged.</P>
<P>Seven of these Prisoners not long after were carried on Ship-board to be transported to the <HI>West-Indies;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven of these Persons put on board to be transport∣ed, and de∣tained two Months by con∣trary Winds, are set ashore again, and return Home.</NOTE> but (which was remarkable) the Ship by contrary Winds and stormy Weather was hindred going to Sea. Not only the Master, whose Name was <HI>Thomas May,</HI> but also his Men grew very uneasie at this: For they believed that Heaven was against them: Nay, the Sailors threatned to leave the Ship, if the Master would not set those Prisoners ashore. And he himself considering how after having lain long in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and more than once set Sail, they were hindred to go on by contrary Winds, resolved at length, after ha∣ving lingred about Two Months, to let the Banished ashore; and so he did, giving them a Certificate, of which I have a Copy in my Custo∣dy, that they were not run away, but freely put ashore by him, for which among others he gave these Reasons, <Q>That seeing the great Adversities they had met with, he concluded from thence, that the Hand of God was against him, and that therefore he durst not go off with these Prisoners, because he found them to be honest Men, who had not deserved Banishment. And also that there was a Law extant, that no <HI>Englishman</HI> might be transported against his Mind. And that his Men refused to proceed on the Voyage if he would carry away these People.</Q> This Certificate he gave under his Hand, and so let them go away free; and not long after the Ship set Sail with a fair Wind. I do not find that the Banished, who returned Home again, were prosecuted on this Account: For the Sentence against them was executed as far as it could at that Time, and they had made no Opposition, but had been Sufferers.</P>
<P>Persecution in the mean while did not cease:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persecution continues.</NOTE> But this did not dis∣courage those called <HI>Quakers;</HI> they continued valiant, as I have seen in many Letters sent about that Time to some of my Acquaintance. One said in the Court of Justice, <HI>We are in the Service of the Lord, and may not leave it;</HI> and another who was offered to be freed of Banish∣ment, if he would pay down an hundred Pounds, said, <HI>Tho' I had an hundred Lives to lose, and could redeem them all for an hundred Pence, yet I would not do it.</HI> But this could not stop the Violence of the Per∣secutors; till an heavier Hand reached them, as may be related here∣after.</P>
<P>In the Months <HI>October</HI> and <HI>December,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">More condem∣ned to be tran¦sported, some of them being Women.</NOTE> many were condemned to Trans∣portation, and among these several Women, whose Trials I shall but cursorily speak of: For if I should relate all Particulars, my De∣scription

<P>On the 13th of <HI>October,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>16</HI> more tried at <HI>Hicks's-Hall</HI> at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> before Justice <HI>Proc∣tor,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> sixteen of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were tried at <HI>Hicks's-Hall,</HI> in <HI>London</HI> for the third Offence, as they called it. The Grand Jury consulting together about finding the Bill of Indictment, could not well agree. And the Justices giving them a Check, one of the Jurymen desired to know, <HI>by what Law they ought to find a Bill against any Persons, without Witnesses to testify the Fact committed.</HI> To which, Answer was made by the Court, <HI>That their Records testified the Crime or Fact, and that such their Record was a sufficient Witness without the Testimony of any Man.</HI> And for Proof of this it was further said, <HI>The Records in Chancery serve as a sufficient Testimony; and if it be so in Chancery, why not here?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Jury not rea∣dily finding a Bill, <HI>E.

This made some of the Jury comply; but others stood it out, and signified that in Conscience they could not consent to what was requi∣ed of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are threatned.</NOTE> But the major Part complying with the Justices, upon their threatning them, and the others being strongly pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, the Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was by a kind of Force accepted at length.

a Commonwealth, as it was before the Restoration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>On the 15th of <HI>October</HI> above forty of the Prisoners called <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> were tried before the Judges <HI>Hide</HI> and <HI>Keeling.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Above 40 tri∣ed before the Judges <HI>Hide</HI> and <HI>Keeling,</HI> whose Pro∣ceedings are very arbitra∣ry, and their Opinions in Law unac∣countable.</NOTE> To mention all the Exorbitances of this Trial, which were not few, I count needless: For as to the Questions and Answers, and the passing of Sentence, the Reader may form to himself an Idea of it from what hath been said already of the Trial at <HI>Hertford,</HI> &amp;c. A Maid being asked, <HI>Guilty or Not Guilty,</HI> answered, <HI>I never was taken at any seditions Meeting or Con∣venticle in my Life.</HI> To which the Judge said, <HI>But Woman, were not you taken at the</HI> Bull and Mouth <HI>the 21st of</HI> August? She answered, <HI>I am in∣nocent in the Sight of God and all good People.</HI> That this was true, the Judge did not deny, but said, <HI>I believe that, Woman, but you have transgressed a Law.</HI> She replied, <HI>As for the</HI> Bull and Mouth, <HI>I believe I have been there an hundred times, and if the Lord permit me Life and Liberty, I do not know, but I may go there an hundred times more.</HI> The Judge then saying, <HI>Wo∣man, will you plead, or no,</HI> Guilty, <HI>or</HI> Not guilty? <HI>or else I must pass Sen∣tence upon you.</HI> She answered, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done, I am innocent.</HI> Yet this could not avail her, tho' Judge <HI>Hide</HI> had said a little before concerning the Prisoners, <HI>If they are innocent, then they are not guilty.</HI> But she was set by as mute, or <HI>pro confesso,</HI> to the Fact charged against her in the Indictment. Others who complained of the Unreasonableness of the Proceedings, were hector'd as Impudents; and the Jury shew∣ing themselves dissatisfied concerning the Witnesses, Judge <HI>Hide</HI> said to them, <HI>It was no Ʋntruth if a Man did mistake in the Time, and that his Evidence was good, tho' he did not see one in the House: For</HI> (said he) <HI>if forty Men be in a Room, and one is brought out of the Room to me, standing at the Door, cannot I swear that he was in that Room, if I see him come out? You must not make such Scruples.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while there were some among the Witnesses who did not know the Prisoners by Face; so that there was Reason enough to dis∣prove their Testimony. But whatever was objected, the Business must go on: For th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one of the Witnesses declared that the <HI>Meeting,</HI> from which the Prisoners had been taken, <HI>was peaceable;</HI> and tho' one of the Prisoners said, That <HI>the Law was made against seditious Meetings, and that nothing of Sedition had been proved against them:</HI> Yet Judge <HI>Keeling</HI> said, <HI>The Act was made to prevent such Meetings, because under Colour and Pretence of Religion, Plots and Conspiracies might be carried on.</HI> And when a Pri∣soner said, <HI>that he was at a Peaceable Godly Meeting, and received much Comfort there;</HI> the Judge returned, <HI>That is as much as we desire. You con∣fess you were there; and tho' it was a peaceable Meeting, yet it was an un∣lawful one.</HI> Another of the Prisoners, who pleaded that <HI>the Law the Court acted by was contrary to</HI> Magna Charta, <HI>and the ancient fundamental Laws of the Land,</HI> was answered by Judge <HI>Hide, If the King and Par∣liament should make a Law that two Justices without a Jury should adjudge a Man to Death for the third Offence as a Felon, without Benefit of Clergy, it would be a good Law, and according to</HI> Magna Charta, <HI>and the Law of the Land; and we should be bound to execute it.</HI> It seems this Judge (who not long after was suddenly summoned hence to appear before the Divine Assizes) was of Opinion, that since the Legislative Power resided in the King and Parliament, all that they resolved and enacted, must pass for good Law. But if I should mention all the Absurdities I meet with in these Proceedings, when should I come to an End? True it is, that sometimes a Shew was made of Pity: For Judge <HI>Keeling</HI> said to two Maids, <HI>We are sorry that such young Maids should be thus deluded.</HI> But be∣cause they would not promise to go to the publick Church, tho' they declared themselves ready to assist at Divine Service, they were deemed
<PB N="416" REF="003104_0427_0FEFF70C0718C1D8"/>
as guilty. Another Prisoner being asked by Judge <HI>Hide, Whether he would go to Church,</HI> answered, <HI>If I have my Liberty, I shall go to Church.</HI> But when it appeared that he did not mean the Established or Publick Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Poulton</HI> asked to swear to his Age.</NOTE> this Promise could not save him. One <HI>Richard Poulton,</HI> a Lad of fifteen Years of Age, who by a Certificate shewed, that he was not yet sixteen Years old, and therefore no Transgressor of the Law, was asked, <HI>If he would swear he was not sixteen?</HI> Just as if he could have re∣membred the Time of his Birth, to which, he answered, <HI>That he was not brought up to Swearing;</HI> and being asked, <HI>Whether he would promise to go to Church?</HI> He answered, <HI>He should promise no such thing.</HI> Then he was returned to the rest that were to be sentenced.</P>
<P>This was on the 17th of the aforesaid Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19 sentenced to Banish∣ment, and four to <HI>Bride∣well,</HI> for 12 Months.</NOTE> when nineteen Per∣sons, among which, some Women were condemned to Banishment, and four married Women to twelve Months Imprisonment in <HI>Bridewell.</HI> None of the Judges it seems had a Mind to pronounce Sentence, and there∣fore they left this Business to the City-Recorder.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Wild.</NOTE> He then bidding the Prisoners to hearken to the Judgment of the Court, spoke so soft∣ly, that he could not well be heard, which made one of the Prison∣ers say, <HI>That he ought to speak louder, for they could not hear him.</HI> But he continuing to speak softly as before, two or three others of the Prison∣ers told him, <HI>they could not tell what he said.</HI> To which he answered, <HI>He cared not whether they did or no;</HI> and then said, Hearken to your Sen∣tence: <HI>You and every of you shall be transported beyond the Seas, the Men to</HI> Barbadoes, <HI>and the Women to</HI> Jamaica, <HI>being two of his Majesty's Plantati∣ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Mi∣nisters not condemned to Banishment.</NOTE> there to remain seven Years.</HI> Thus the Persecutors endeavoured to be rid of the <HI>Quakers:</HI> But tho' Persecution now was very hot, yet they fainted not, neither were they in Want of such vigilant Assistants, as both by Example and Words continually encouraged them to Faith∣fulness, who yet (which was remarkable) were not condemned to Ba∣nishment, as many others.</P>
<P>Among these was <HI>Josiah Coale</HI> also,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Coale</HI>'s Exhortation to Constancy under Sufferings, &amp;c.</NOTE> who about this Time, as I have been told, was in Prison at <HI>London,</HI> and both by Writing, and by Word of Mouth, did exhort his Fellow-Believers to Constancy: For (when under Confinement) he betook himself to his Pen, and recommended to his Friends, <HI>That they would not forsake their Meetings, tho' they were to undergo great Sufferings, since it was God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s good Pleasure to let their Patience be try'd. And,</HI> said he, <HI>that these Afflictions come upon us is by God's Per∣mission? Who then shall gainsay him, or endeavour to reason with him about Matters of so great a Concern, since his Way is hid from Man. He also signi∣fied to them, that this was done to try their Faith, and therefore they ought to continue bold, and persevere valiantly. And tho', said he, great Sufferings and Afflictions attend us, yet my Heart, praised be the Lord, is not troubled, neither hath Fear seized me, because I see the Intent of the Lord in it.</HI> And in one Letter he spoke thus; <Q>Friends, this know, that for the Sake of the Residue of the Seed which is yet ungathered, is my Life free∣ly sacrificed up into the Hand of the Lord; and ready and willing am I to lay it down for the Testimony of God's blessed Truth, which he hath given me to bear, if thereunto I am called: For Bonds and Afflictions attend me daily, and I may say, we are in Jeopardy of our Lives daily: So let your Prayer to God be for me, that I may be kept unto the End, to finish my Testimony with Joy, and in all things to bring Glory and Honour to the Name of the Lord, who is over all blessed for ever.</Q> This his Christian Desire he obtained, as will be said in due Place. It was a Time of Suffering; and those to whose Share it fell, continued valiant, whilst others did not neglect to exhort the King and Parliament to leave off Persecution. Among these was <HI>William Bayly,</HI> who gave forth a very serious Exhortation

<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE God of Heaven hath put it into my Heart to write a few Words unto you, in the Fear and Dread of his Name, and in the Counsel of his own Will, concerning the Work which ye have ta∣ken in hand against him and his People; this is not the End and Work for which the Lord God hath permitted you into the Places of <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Rule,</HI> in these Nations (nor the Way for you to pros∣per, nor to prolong your Days in the Earth) thus to <HI>persecute</HI> and <HI>afflict</HI> an <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>harmless People,</HI> who are peaceable, and walk up∣rightly (towards God and Man) therein, endeavouring (in all Things) <HI>to keep their Consciences void of Offence,</HI> and who have no Helper in the Earth but the Lord alone; neither is their Kingdom of this World, but they are verily the Children and Servants of the Most High God, whom he hath gathered from amongst Men, and from the Kindreds of the Earth, to be the first Fruits unto him, and to the Lamb in this Age; and we are his, and not our own, he hath bought us, and redeemed us unto himself, and to him alone have we com∣mitted our innocent Cause, and he hath undertaken to plead it for us, with all our Adversaries; and <HI>No Weapon formed against us shall ever prosper, but be broken to Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore Friends, be awakened and open your Eyes, and see what a Stir and ado here is in this Nation, to hale and drag up and down a Company of <HI>tender, innocent, and harmless People, Men and Women, and Children from their peaceable Meetings,</HI> who meet together in the Fear and tender Love of God, without any evil or bad Intent toward any, but have Goodwill and Compassion toward all Men, even to the <HI>worst of our Enemies,</HI> as the Lord bears us Witness, and these are them that are driven as Sheep to the Slaughter, and thrown into your noisome Jails, and Prisons, and Houses of Correction, by rude and brutish People (your Servants) whom you have set on Work by your Authority, till many of them have <HI>(patiently) suffered till Death, whose innocent Blood will assuredly be required at your Hands,</HI> (tho' they shall not go free of the Guilt, who have had the least Hand in it, without spee∣dy Repentance. And thus ye may see and read, how the Disciples of Christ Jesus are as <HI>Sheep and Lambs in the midst of Wolves</HI> in this Age, and as a <HI>Lilly among Thorns,</HI> and all this is only for obeying his Com∣mands, and for worshipping the everlasting invisible God in the Spi∣rit, and in the Truth, according to the Scriptures, the which if ye knew and understood, you would tremble to think what you have done against them, to cause so many of the little Ones, which be∣lieve in Christ, so grievously to suffer, who said, <HI>It were better a Mil∣stone were hanged about his Neck, and be drowned in the Depth of the Sea, that should offend one of these little Ones, that believe in me;</HI> and as true as Christ Jesus suffered, and rose again, and as God liveth, who rai∣sed him from the Dead, <HI>We are some of those his little Ones that believe in him,</HI> who (in Derision and Scorn in this Age) are called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as ye might call <HI>Moses,</HI> the Prophets and Apostles (in Days past) who did quake and tremble at the Presence of the Lord, who is the same now as ever he was, tho' the ungodly know him not, nor his Power: And we are of that poor and afflicted People mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeph. iii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Zeph. iii. 12. Whose Trust is only in the Name of the Lord, who will undo all their Op∣pessors at this the Return of their Captivity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="003104_0429_0FEFF70F8753DEA8"/>But what shall I say unto you? If ye will not, or cannot believe our faithful Testimony (or the Testimony of God thro' us) and the In∣nocency of our Cause and Sufferings, neither will ye believe, if one should rise from the Dead, and declare it unto you; for many tender Visitations, and timely Warnings, and gentle Reprehensions have you had, from the pure Spirit of the Lord God, both from his Witness in your own Consciences, and from his faithful Servants and Messen∣gers, who have written and declared unto you in his Name and Pow∣er in this your Day. And as for my Part who am one of the least of the Thousands of <HI>Israel,</HI> I could willingly have been silent as toward you at this Time, but the Lord (whom I serve in my Spirit) hath laid it upon me to warn you once more (for whose Sakes I have born a Burthen) in the true Sight and Sense of your sad Estate, and of the Day of thick Darkness, Wrath and Distress, which is hastening upon you from the Almighty.</P>
<P>Wherefore be not proud nor rebellious, but hear, and obey the Word of the Lord; for thus saith the Lord God that made Heaven and Earth, <HI>Let my innocent People alone, and touch them not any more, as ye have done; for they are mine, and I have called them, and chosen them, and redeemed them, they are my Jewels, which I am making up, they shall shew forth my Glory before Men to the whole World; I have anointed them, and I will preserve them and deliver them, and crown them with an everlasting Salvation. I will rebuke Kings and Rulers for their Sakes, and distress Nations, and dis∣throne the Mighty from their Seats that rise up against them, as I have done; and let my everlasting Gospel have a free Passage in these Nations; end do not reproach and afflict my Servants and Messengers so any more, whom I have chosen and sent to preach and declare the Way of Life and Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, but how your Ear and your Heart unto them and their Testimony, that it may be well with you, and prolong your Days; for he that blesseth them, shall be blessed, and he that curseth them, shall be cursed, and every Hand shall wither that opposeth them, as hath been, and shall be, henceforth for ever: I the Lord have spoken it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But and if you will not hear, but will still persist, and go on, as ye have done, to oppress my Heritage, and harmless People, and make War and Op∣position against my Power and Truth, and thus set your selves and your Pow∣er against me, the living God; I will bring you down suddenly, to the Asto∣nishment of Nations, and I'll cut your Day short, and turn your Pleasures in∣to Howling and Lamentation, and Shame and Contempt shall cover your Memorial as a Garment: Thus will I work for the Deliverance of my Seed, and none shall let it; for the Year of my Redeemed is come, and the Day of Vengeance is in my Heart, to plead its Cause with all Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore consider your Ways, and see what ye are doing, and what the Effect of this your Work will be; ye are but Men, and the <HI>Children of Men, who were but as Yesterday;</HI> your Breath also is in your Nostrils, and your Life is but a Vapour, which will soon vanish away: You labour in the very Fire, and bring forth Wind, which blows up the Flame of that which will consume you, and deprive you of all Happiness for ever: (O that ye had but Hearts to consider it! For the more you strive with the Lord, and oppress his People, the more will they multiply and grow stronger and stronger, and you shall wax weaker and weaker, and your Works shall be your heavy Burden; for Life and Immortality is risen, and the Power of God is stirring in the Hearts of Thousands, and Light, Understanding (the excellent Spirit which was in <HI>Dani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>) is breaking forth like the Lightning (which shines out of the East into the West) in the Sight of many People, whereby they know it's the Day of the coming of the Son of Man, with Power and great Glory, that every Eye may see him, and they
<PB N="419" REF="003104_0430_0FEFF753C1F63668"/>
that have pierced him shall mourn bitterly: So, your Labour is in vain, and your Works for the Fire, and your striving with your Maker to no Purpose, as to effect your End and Aim. And of these Things you have been often fore-warned, and the Lord hath been very long-suffering towards you, in sparing you thus long, and suffering you thus far to act against him and his dear People; and his Mercy and Forbearance hath been evidently shewed in a large Measure unto you, in deferring his heavy Judgments thus long, which must have been confess'd to be just upon you: And will you thus requite the Lord, by increasing your Tasks of Oppression upon his tender innocent Peo∣ple? O Unwise and ungrateful Generation! Hath not God yet shew∣ed you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Micah vi. 8.</NOTE> that <HI>You should do justly, and love Mercy, and walk humbly?</HI> But are these your Fruits and Practices, Fruits of Mercy or Justice? or if there be any Tincture or Spark of Love or Humility in them, <HI>Let God's Witness (the Light) in all your Consciences, and in People, answer.</HI> I tell you plainly, That such Fruits and Doings among you, that profess your selves Christians, have made the very Name of Christ and Christianity a Proverb of Reproach thro' Nations, and have caused the God of Heaven to be blasphemed: And how could it be other∣wise, seeing you who profess the most Knowledge of God, and have talked of <HI>Converting the Heathen</HI> (as some of your Leaders have done) are found the least in the Life and Fruits thereof? But to what would they convert them? <HI>To Pride, and Swearing and Drunkenness, and Op∣pression, and all Manner of Excess, and to persecute People for their good Conscience?</HI> They have no Need of That; for, some of them have said, <HI>they did not use <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swear and be drunk, &amp;c. till they came among the</HI> Christians, <HI>and learned of them, they did not do so in their own Country:</HI> Ye are so far from converting them, being out of the Life of what ye profess and talk of your selves, that the very <HI>Heathen</HI> or <HI>Infidels</HI> (as ye call them) do judge and condemn you (who are making Enqui∣ry) concerning these your Proceedings against this harmless People, among whom some of them have been kindly entreated, who visited them at the Lord's Requiring, tho' contrary in Opinion and Religi∣on; and this doth rise up in Judgment against you.</P>
<P>But, Friends, have not you your selves been under Suffering, and some of you been driven into strange Countries or Lands, for your Cause (as it was called)? Nay, did not the King himself once flee for Refuge to a Tree, to save himself from his Enemies Hands? if not, why are there such Representations made of it, in so many Places in the Nation? And was not this a great Mercy, and Deliverance from God, so to obscure and preserve him, from them who pursued him (and many of you also)? And are these Things forgotten? Can Mercy be loved, except it be remembred? And do you remember and love his Mercies, by doing justly, and walking humbly with him, as he doth require? Or do you boast in a vain Glory, as if your own Arm had done it, or your own Strength or Deserts had delivered you? if so, then God must needs be forgotten, and his Mercies trod under foot, and his Visitations and Counsels cast behind your Back;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> and so, <HI>all that forgot God, shall be torn in Pieces, and there shall be none to deliver them,</HI> as it is written.</P>
<P>And were these your Sufferings (which you sustained by them ye opposed) Unjust and Unequal? and if you should say, <HI>They were;</HI> then I say, it is much more Unjust and very Unequal (in the Sight of God, and all sober People that fear him) for you, thus to inflict such cruel Sufferings, as Imprisoning and Stifling up to Death in your noisom Jails and Holes among Thieves and Murderers, and to pronounce Sentence of Banishment upon an innocent, harmless, peaceable People,
<PB N="420" REF="003104_0431_0FEFF7120F2E8D08"/>
that do not oppose you in the least with any outward Force, neither do so much as the Thoughts of it lodge within our Breasts, as the Lord God knoweth (who hath called us to Peace) but on the con∣trary, have sought and do seek your Welfare and Happiness, both in this World and in the World to come, which in Time shall be ma∣fest to the whole Earth.</P>
<P>And if you say, <HI>Your Sufferings were unjust and unequal (tho' you did oppose them, and make War against them so long as you could) because they deprived you of your Rights and Priviledges, and just Liberties, and natural Birth-rights, &amp;c. which were your Due to enjoy, as being Freeborn of the Na∣tion:</HI> Then how much more is it unjust, and unequal, and unrighte∣teous, thus to inflict Sufferings upon your Friends, and oppress your peaceable Neighbours, who are free-born People of the same Nation, and do not oppose you, but are tender towards you (as aforesaid) and subject to all wholsome just Laws, and tributary to you, for which Causes we ought to have our just Liberty, and enjoy the Pri∣viledge of our Birthright, which is our Due (so long as we live peaceably and harmlesly) but if it be not a Priviledge to be pleaded for, then are all your own Grounds and Reasons, and Cause, without a Foundation, and you and the whole Nation may be swept away by any that are able to do it, without being charged with Injustice or Oppression, which is contrary to the just Ballance (the Light of Christ) in all Peoples Consciences. And as we are the dearly beloved People of the Most High God, who doth bless us with his Presence, and manifest his everlasting Love and Good-will towards us daily, and over-shadow us with his Power and tender Mercies, whom he hath gathered out of the evil Ways and Spirit of this World, and all the Vanities thereof, unto himself, to walk with him who is invisi∣ble, in the upright, blameless, undefiled Life, in the Midst of a crook∣ed and perverse Generation; I say, considering these Things, how greatly and unrighteously do our Sufferings appear to all sober Peo∣ple, whose Eyes are open, and will be more open to discern and sa∣vour the Bitterness of that proud, envious, wrathful Spirit, which thus hath acted and deceived you; and its End is numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by them that have Wisdom from above.</P>
<P>For Friends, set aside the reproachful Name of <HI>Quakers,</HI> and the o∣ther Titles of Derision and Scorn (which the envious and blood-thirsty Spirit hath invented to render the People of God odious in all Ages) and tell me what ye have justly to charge against this People, (whom you so furiously pursue to the Dens and Caves of the Earth, to the Loss of the Lives of so many of them; by which <HI>Children are made Fatherless,</HI> and <HI>tender-hearted Women, mournful Widows)</HI> and let it come forth to open View, and declare it abroad (as your Articles against them) to the whole World, and speak the Truth, and nothing but the Truth, as you use to tell one another) that all People may right∣ly know and understand the very Ground and most secret Cause who do enquire of these your present Proceedings against them; for Notice is taken by many, and ere long it must be manifest to all Men, as the Folly and Madness of <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres</HI> was, that withstood <HI>Moses;</HI> for you withstand no less than him of whom <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> wrote, who said, <HI>I am the Light of the World,</HI> against whom <HI>Saul</HI> was once exceedingly mad, and had Thoughts to do very much against that Way (which was then as well as now) call'd <HI>Heresie,</HI> till the Light of Jesus (whom he persecuted, met with him, with his Let∣ters (or Wrrrants) <HI>to hale Men and Women to Prison</HI> (as your Servants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>) and smote him to the Ground, and made him tremble, who (from that Time) became such a <HI>Quaker</HI> as you now persecute and imprison

till Death: But the Light of Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God, will meet with all Persecutors, and Oppressors about Religion, let them be never so mad, or think they ought to do much against that Way they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Heresie,</HI> as some of you have said, who have made a Mock at the Light, even publickly, which many took Notice of, and even marvelled at such Blasphemy (in an open Court) against the Saviour of the World: And there is no other Name under Heaven by which Men shall be saved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John vii. 12 <HI>and</HI> 16.</NOTE> but him who said, <HI>I am the Light of the World, who lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI></P>
<P>And this is he in whom we have believed, and of whom we have declared, and must declare and bear Testimony as long as we have a Being; and the World shall know that our Testimony is true, and for his Name and Truth only, do we thus patiently suffer the Contradic∣tions of Sinners, as our Brethren did by the zealous <HI>Jews,</HI> in Ages past; but you are not so zealous for Christ's Law and Command∣ments, as they were of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets (which Christ ends and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) who thought it was not lawful to do Good on the Sab∣bath-Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke vi. 35, 36</NOTE> (as to heal the Sick) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or then would you <HI>do to all Men as ye would they should do to you;</HI> for his Law runs thus, and <HI>Be you mer∣ciful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. v. 34▪ &amp;c.</NOTE> &amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Love you your Enemies:</HI> and <HI>Swear not at all, &amp;c.</HI> as ye may read.</P>
<P>But behold, how both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> take Notice, and are asha∣med and grieved, to hear and see what a Deal of bad Works you do even on your Sabbath-Day (as some of you call it) and how you prophane the Day of your Worship, with your Cattle and Servants which are within your Gates) what riding, and running, and toyl∣ing, in Rage and Fury, (like Mad-men) Sweating, and Swearing, and Cursing, and dragging, and haling the innocent Members of Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Body, out of their peaceable Meetings, into your Jails and Holes, on your Day of Worship.

If ye have Peace and Pleasure herein, let me tell you, from the righteous God, You are hardned in your Sins against him, and he will break your Peace speedily, and turn your Pleasure into Bitterness and Lamentation; and his innocent Peoples Meetings shall stand, and be increased; and their Way shall prosper, and the Truth shall spread and prevail, and have Dominion over all Nations; and their Enemies shall fall, and be confounded, let them strive what they can against them; for they are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God (and not of Man, or the Will of Man) and they seek his Glory and not their own; and such as abide faithful to him, shall triumph over all the Principalities, and Powers of the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, and make a Shew openly of the Victory over all that do or may oppose them; for their Life is Immortal, and the Lord of Heaven and Earth is their Strength, who is with them as a mighty terrible One; therefore shall their Persecutors fall before them.</P>
<P>And let me tell you again, That by these your unreasonable, and unjust Dealings, the Understandings of Thousands are the more open∣ed, and the tender sober Part, or Principle in them, doth feel the Weight and Burthen of this Grievousness, which you have prescribed, and do so eagerly pursue, to the imprisoning to Death so many innoc∣ent Persons and free-born People of this Nation, besides Hundreds are liable to the same, (which yet remain in your Prisons;) and your unnatural, cruel Sentence of Banishment, to separate dear and tender Husbands from their dear and tender Wives and tender Children, and little innocent Babes; O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! how do ye rend the Bowels of the Meek of the Earth, whom God hath blessed?

If you had the Hearts of Men, or of Flesh, ye would be afraid and blush at the ve∣ry Thoughts hereof; my Heart and Soul melts within me, and I am even bowed down, with Cries to God, in my Spirit, to think of the Hardness of your Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>God Almighty, cut short thy Work in Righteousness, and shorten the Days of Oppression and Cruelty for thine Elect's Sake; which cry Night and Day unto thee; and make known thy Name and Power to the Ends of the Earth; and let the</HI> Heathen <HI>hear, and fear, and bow to thy righteous Scepter; and let the Kings of the Earth lay down their Crowns at the Feet of the Lamb, that thro' thy righteous Judgments they may partake of thy tender Mercies, which endure for ever, that their Eyes may be no longer with-holden, nor blinded by the God of this World (the Power and Prince of Darkness) but that they might come to see thee, who art invisible, and enjoy the same precious Life of pure unfeigned Love which abounds in the Hearts of thy hidden Ones, and re∣ceive thy peaceable Wisdom, to be governed, and to govern therein; then would they surely know,</HI> that we are thine, <HI>and confess to thy glorious Truth and speak good of thy Name, and magnify thy Power, and no longer coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Blood of thy everlasting Covenant (wherewith we are sanctified) as an un∣holy Thing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But O thou righteous, holy, pure, eternal God, art unknown unto all them that sit in Darkness, and dwell in the Spirit of Enmity against thee and thy People, tho' thou art come near to Judgment, according to the Promise,</HI> Mal. iii. 5. <HI>and thy Way of Life and Salvation is hid from them, therefore they hate us without a Cause, and thus evilly entreat us in the Darkness of their Minds, and in the Ignorance and Hardness of their Hearts, for which my Soul doth pity them, and even entreat thee for them, That if possible, their Eyes may be yet opened, and their Hearts softened, and their Spirit humbled, that they may see what they are doing in the Dark, and consider the Effect of their Work, which will assuredly follow: And if thy Warnings and gentle Visitations will not humble them, then let thy Judgments awaken them, and bring them down, and humble them, that they may perceive something of what thou art doing (in these latter Days) and art resolved to do to the Ends of the Earth, tho' the whole World should gather and band together to oppose thy Work and People; for thou hast began (and thou wilt go thro' and perfect) thy Work; thou wilt raise thy Seed, and gather thine Elect from the four Winds, and bring them from the Ends of the Earth, and scatter the Proud in the vain Imaginations of their Hearts; and thou wilt break thy Way thro' all that oppose thee in this the Day of thy mighty Power, in which thou art arisen (as a Giant to run his Race) to finish Transgression, and make an End of Sin, and bring in and establish everlasting Righteousness, that the King∣doms of this World may become thy Kingdoms, and of thy Christ, as thou hast promised, and art now fulfilling; Glory, and Honour, and Thanks, and ever∣lasting Praises be to thy glorious Name, World without End,</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>So Friends, ye are and have been warned again and again by the faithful Messengers and Servants of the Lord, in Love to your Souls; and you are left without Excuse, if never Words more should be mentioned unto you; by which ye might perceive, how the Lord doth strive with you, that ye might repent, and be saved from the Wrath to come, tho' some of you feel little of it in your own Con∣sciences; but <HI>his Spirit will not always strive with you:</HI> For, if you will not believe them, but slight and reject them, and neither make Con∣science of what hath proceeded out of your own Mouth, nor regard

<P>The fulfilling of this Prediction we shall see; for within a short Time a War ensued with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the Pestilence appeared at <HI>London;</HI> but before it broke out, yet more of the imprison'd <HI>Quakers</HI> were con∣demned to Banishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">32 more <HI>Quakers</HI> con∣demned to ba∣nishment, with somewhat re∣markable of the Judges opinions.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> two and thirty Persons, both Men and Women, who were sentenced by the Court on the 6th, 14th and 15th of <HI>December,</HI> for whatever they said in Defence of themselves, proved ineffectual.

Thus we see, if there was but Evidence that the Prisoners had been at a Meeting, this was counted sufficient to condemn them. A Woman being asked, what she had to say to the Evidence given, answered, <HI>Be it known unto you all, if I had as many Bodies as Hairs on my Head, I could lay them all down for the living eternal Truth of the living God.</HI> After all the Prisoners had been called to the Bar, they were at length sentenced to be transported to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and to remain there seven Years.</P>
<P>This Year in <HI>September,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Mother dies.</NOTE> died my Mother <HI>Judith Zinspenning</HI> at <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> where she was born of religious Parents among the

<HI>Baptists,</HI> into whose Society her Father Conrad <HI>Zinspenning</HI> was entred in a singular Manner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Account of her Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> of which, tho' it may seem somewhat out of my Road, yet because of the remarkable Steps of Providence appearing therein, I'll give a short Account. He being of <HI>Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gn</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> was bred a Papist; and after he had pass'd the Latin Schools, his Father thrust him into a Cloister; (for Papists us'd to think it meritorious to offer up one of their Children to the Clergy.) But he found the mona∣stical Life so much against his Inclination, that his Father dying be∣fore the Probation-Year was expired, he begg'd his Mother to assist him in his Intention to leave the Fraternity, since he was not yet bound by Vow. She comply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with his Desire, and so he got out, and then was put to a Trade. After he had served his Time, he resolved to tra∣vel and first took a Turn to <HI>Holland,</HI> from thence to <HI>France,</HI> and then to <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Metropolis <HI>Rome,</HI> and so back again Having been a Lay-Friar, he got Letters of Recommendation to such Monasteries as were of the Order of those Monks he had lived with; that so he might freely find Lodging there for some Time. And because in <HI>Holland</HI> there are no Cloisters, he was recommended to some eminent Papists at <HI>Am∣sterdam;</HI> whither being come, he lik'd the Place so well, that he re∣solved to stay there some Time; which he did, after having found Em∣ployment. And thus getting into Acquaintance, he came in Time to live with a <HI>Baptist,</HI> who employed him as a Journeyman. He never till now, met with the <HI>New Testament,</HI> in which he began to read so eager∣ly, that the Lord co-operating by his good Spirit, his Understanding came to be opened, so that he got a clear Sight of the Superstition and Errors of the Popish Religion, in which he was trained up; and then entring into Discourse with his Master, was perswaded to renounce Popery, and to enter into the Communion of the <HI>Baptists.</HI> This broke all his Measures concerning his intended Travels; and then resolving to settle where he was, he took to Wife one <HI>Katherine de M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> a vertuous Maid, whose Father was one of the primitive <HI>Baptists</HI> that arose un∣der the Persecution in <HI>Flanders,</HI> from whence he with many more came to settle in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>From these Parents my Mother descended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And of herself.</NOTE> who was religiously in∣clined even from her Youth, and became so well versed in the Holy Scriptures, and was so diligent in writing down so much of the Ser∣mons she heard, as she could retain by Memory, that her Father said sometimes, <HI>It is pity that this Girl is not a Boy, who then in Time might be∣come an eminent Instrument in the Church.</HI> After she was come to Age, tho' much inclined to lead a single Life, yet at length she was married to my Father <HI>Jacob Williamson Sewel,</HI> a very religious young Man, whose Fa∣ther, <HI>William Sewel</HI> from <HI>Kidderminster</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> having been one of those <HI>Brownists,</HI> that left <HI>England,</HI> and settled in <HI>Holland,</HI> mar∣ried a <HI>Dutch</HI> Wife at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> where my Father was born, who being come to Age, endeavoured to walk in the narrow Way, and conversed mostly with the strictest Professors of those Days. And both he and my Mother came in Time to grow dissatisfied with that Worship to which they were joined; yet in Clearness of Understanding my Mo∣ther exceeded my Father, nevertheless she continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>atisfied as well as he, with the common Way of Worship she belonged to; so that oftentimes, when she came form the Meeting-house, she resolved not to go there any more, because she reaped no real and substantial Benefit by it. But then the first Day of the Week being come again, she was in Streight, thinking that however it was, yet by the Apo∣stle we were exhorted not to forsake the Assemblies. In this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resolute Condition she continued a long Time; and being incumbred with the Cares of the Family, she was not so much at Liberty for performing
<PB N="425" REF="003104_0436_0FEFF75CA74FEB48"/>
religious Duties (<HI>viz.</HI> Prayers, reading of, and meditating on the Holy Scriptures, visiting the Sick, and such like pious Exercises) as she was before she was married; which made her wish sometimes she had never entred into Matrimony, and that she might live to enjoy again that Peace and Quiet which once she had. But she knew not yet that it was the Love of the Lord thus working upon her, to draw her off from transitory Things. In this State she was often seized with Grief and Sorrow, so that she counted her self the most miserable of Women; for neither Husband, nor Children, nor any outward Enjoyments, could afford her any Pleasure; but all her Desire was to attain to an unde∣fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed State, in which she might live an unblameable Life, not only be∣fore Men, but also before God: For feeling there was yet something in her which was evil and polluting, she struggled to overcome it; but all her Labour proved in vain. This made her cry earnestly to the Lord as one in great Danger; and her Doubts, whether it was possible to attain to Perfection, encreased. But in this forlorn State it pleased the Lord to manifest himself to her in some Measure, tho' she knew not then it was he. And often she cry'd out, <HI>Lord, what will it avail me to know that thou hast sent thy Son into the World, and that he was crucified and died for the Sins of the World, if I am not saved by it. Lord, forgive my Sins, and have Mercy upon me.</HI> And once when she was alone, pour∣ing out her Heart before the Lord, he made himself known to her, and spoke to her Soul, <HI>That if she would be perfect, she must follow the Light in every Respect.</HI> Having heard this, she desired to know what this <HI>Light was;</HI> and the Lord shewed her, <HI>That the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> This she understood in some Degree, and so separated herself as much as e∣ver she could conveniently from Conversation, endeavouring to live re∣tiredly. And having about this Time heard Dr. <HI>Galenus Abrahamsz,</HI> an eminent <HI>Baptist</HI> Teacher, preach upon the Parable of the Seedsman, that which he spoke concerning the good Ground, and how the Ground must be fitted by the Lord's Working, so affected her, that she resol∣ved to rest from all her own Labour; and so she left frequenting the <HI>Baptists</HI> Assemblies any more.</P>
<P>In this retired State she continued a good while, and at length came to hear <HI>William Ames</HI> preach; and he declaring the Light of Christ as the true Teacher, this agreed with what had already been told her in∣wardly by the immediate Manifestations of the Lord to her. And thus she came fully to be convinced that this was the Truth she had so long desired to know. Now she saw that it was her Duty to give up all, and to keep nothing back: For she had already seen, that if she would be Christ's Disciple, she must forsake all, even her own self. But a Fear of the Cross was no small Impediment to her; yet now she gave up to Obedience; and saw that her former Performances had been defective; and now all came into Remembrance. This caused Sorrow; but she prayed to the Lord both Night and Day, and then he manifested his Power by which she was led out of the Darkness and Bondage, where∣in she had been held Captive; and her Supplication was to the Lord, that it might not be with her as formerly, to wit, sometimes great Zeal, and then Coldness again; but that she might continue in Fervency of Spirit. After a long Time of Mourning the Lord manifested his Kindness to her, by which she came to be quickned and refreshed; and by the Judgments of the Lord all was narrowly searched out; so that nothing could be hid; and a Separation was made between the precious and the vile, and Death passed over all. But thus to part with all her own Wisdom, and forsake her great Attainments, was no small Cross; yet she became willing to bear it, altho' many violent Tempests rose to draw her off, if possible, from close adhering to the Beloved of her
<PB N="426" REF="003104_0437_0FEFF718AE7D61E8"/>
Soul; yet she was not forward in Imitation: For my Father, who when he was convinced of the Truth preached by <HI>W. Ames,</HI> and <HI>W. Ca∣ton,</HI> soon left off the common Way of Salutation, would sometimes perswade her by Arguments to do so too: But she told him, if the leaving off of that Custom was a Thing the Lord required, she believed he would shew it her in his own Time, because she was given up to follow his Requirings. And so the Lord did in due Time; and she con∣tinuing zealously faithful, he was pleased after my Father's Death to give her a publick Testimony, and she became eminently gifted: For her natural Abilities surpassing the ordinary Qualifications of her Sex, and becoming sanctified by the Spirit of the Lord, could not but produce good Effects; and she came to be much visited and sought to by Pro∣fessors; and the Fifth-Monarchy-Men applauded her, because of her pathetical Admonitions. But she was above Flattery, and trampled up∣on it. Nay, she was so well esteemed, that I remember, having some Movings to visit the Collegians in their Meeting, after one of them had left off speaking, she stood up, and said, <Q>That she had something upon her Mind to speak to them by Way of Exhortation. But knowing that they suffered not Women to speak amongst them, she was not willing bluntly to intrude her self; but desired their Leave;</Q> which they readily granted, and one of their chief Speakers said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o her, <HI>It is true, Friend, we don't allow Women to speak in the Church; Yet we bear that Respect to you, that we give you the Liberty of speaking.</HI> And then she cleared her self, having formerly been a Frequenter of that Assem∣bly. And when she had done speaking, I don't remember she was contradicted by any; but one of their Speakers concluded the Meeting with a Prayer.</P>
<P>Before that Time, she writ and published a small Book to those of her former Society, which she called, <HI>A Serious Reproof of the Flemish Baptists;</HI> in which she dealt very plainly with them; and shewed how they were apostatized. She writ also some other Treatises, extant in Print; and was much beloved and well esteemed by <HI>English</HI> Friends, as appears by several Letters written to her from <HI>England,</HI> and yet ex∣tant. Those of her own Nation often resorted to her for Instruction, she being so well exercised in the Way of the Lord, that she was able to speak a Word in Season to various Conditions. Many Times she visited the Meetings at <HI>Alkmaar, Harlem,</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and was often invited by her Friends to come and edify them with her Gift. She writ also many Letters for Edification and Admonition to particular Persons, and some Epistles also to the Church. But it pleased the Lord to take her early to himself. When she fell sick, she soon had a Sense that she was not like to recover, and therefore spoke much to me in private, and acquainted me with several Things touching my self, and relating to her outward Estate. And the Night before she departed, she called me to her Bed-side, and exhorted me very fervently to depart from Evil, and to fear the Lord; which by the Mercy of God in Time made very deep Impression on my Mind; so that still I find Reason to bless the Name of the Lord for having been pleased that I was the Son of such an excellent Mother, who early in the Morning when she felt Death approaching, called me up out of my Bed, and sent me to her Brother, and to <HI>W. Caton,</HI> to come and see her, and I had hardly been returned a Quarter of an Hour before she departed this Life, and slept in Peace, to my great Grief then; tho' afterwards, when I came to Years of discerning, I saw Reason to believe that it was not without a singular Providence that the Lord had taken her away: For one had long continued to be an importunate Suitor to her, who in Time lost his In∣tegrity. To give a small Instance of her true Zeal for God, I'll insert
<PB N="427" REF="003104_0438_0FEFF75F0400D760"/>
here the following Epistle she writ to her Friends, to stir up the pure Mind in them.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>An <HI>EPISTLE</HI> to the <HI>Friends</HI> of <HI>Truth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GRACE and Peace be multiplied among you,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Zinspin∣ning's</HI> Epistle to her Friends.</NOTE> my dearly and much beloved Friends, you that have received a Blessing from God the heavenly Father in Christ Jesus, the Lord of Glory, who by his unspeakable Love, and his unchangeable Light, hath drawn you from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the imaginary Worships, and brought you in Measure to know him who was from the Beginning. Dear Friends, keep in the Light by which ye are enlightned, and in the Knowledge of God, which every one hath received for himself; watching against the Seducings of Satan, that your Eyes may be kept open, lest Deceit should prevail in any of you, by which Truth might lose its Splen∣dor, and the Brightness of the Lord become darkned.</P>
<P>I write these Things to you in true Love; and tho' but young, yet as one that takes Care for you; for the Lord knows how often ye are in my Remembrance; desiring for you, that ye may not only know the Truth, but that ye may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to be living Witnesses of it: For I knowing the Preciousness of it, cannot but desire that others may also participate of the same: Labour therefore for it my Friends, that so, when the Lord comes and calls to an Account, every one may be found faithful according to what he hath received; For this is the Talent which the Lord hath given, <HI>viz.</HI> the Knowledge of him who is true, and who rewardeth every one according to his Deeds: But the neg∣ligent and slothful Servant said, that his Lord was an hard Man, and that he gathered where he had not strawed, and this was his Condem∣nation: For the Lord said, <HI>Thou knewest that I was an austere Man: Where∣fore then gavest not thou my Money into the Bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with Ʋsury?</HI> Mind these Things, my beloved Friends, ye that have an Ear to hear, and dig after this Parable in your selves; for we all have received Talents, some more, and others less. Let therefore every one be faithful to the Lord, according to what he hath received; for truly some of you, I believe, have received five Ta∣lents. Let it but be duly considered and seen in the Light of the Lord, what Knowledge ye have had of the eternal God beyond many, even when ye were yet in Darkness: How often hath the Lord appeared, and clearly made manifest himself? And how abundantly hath he made it known in the Heart, that he it was who was worthy to be feared and served? Certainly this is a great and weighty Talent, and therefore the Lord may say justly, What could I have done more to my Vineyard? O my Friends, besides all this, he hath caused his eternal Light to shine into our Hearts, whereby we have seen the corrupted Ways of the World, and the Paths leading to Death. This, I say, the Lord hath shewed us by his eternal Light, Glory and Praises be given to our God for ever.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, go on in that which ye have begun; for I can bear Witness for the Lord, that his Love hath been abundantly shed abroad upon us, without Respect of Persons, because those that fear him, and work Righteousness, are acceptable to him: And he makes his Truth manifest among us, and causeth his Peace and Mercy to rest upon us. It is true, that Satan doth not rest to scatter this, and to sow Doubts and Unbelief in our Hearts; but we keeping close to the Lord, are preserved from his Snares; and happy is he who hath found a Place where he is freed from Tempests: But before this Place be found, there are many hidden Rocks that may be struck on, not unknown to
<PB N="428" REF="003104_0439_0FEFF71B1BB761F8"/>
me. And therefore I have true Compassion on those who are not pass'd them all yet; for Shipwreck may easily be suffered on any of these.</P>
<P>Yet in all this Danger there is something on which we may rely safely, and to which we may trust, being as a Beacon, <HI>viz.</HI> the Light shining into our Hearts, tho' it be sometimes but as a Spark, and so small, in Regard of the manifold Seducings, that it can hardly be discern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Here then is no small Grief and Anguish; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere all the Mer∣cies of the Lord, which formerly we enjoy'd abundantly, are called in Question, or doubted of; here is Danger, and yet Certainty; for by not shining, the Beacon is minded, and by relying on a true Hope to be saved, we are preserved in the Tempest. I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e these Things for the Information of those that are travelling towards a City that hath a Foundation, and whose Builder and Maker is God; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o such my Love is extended, and my Desire to the Lord for them, is, that they may be kept by his Power, to remain standing at his coming.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, keep your Meetings in the Fear of the Lord, and have a Care that your Minds are not drawn out to hear Words out∣wardly, but stand in the Cross to that which desireth Refreshment from without: And when at any Time ye feel but little Refresh∣ment, let it not enter into your Hearts, that the Lord is not mindful of you, but center down into your selves, in the pure Light, and stand still therein, then it may be, ye will find the Cause why the Presence of the Lord is departed from you for some Time; and ye putting away the Cause, shall enjoy the Lord again to your Comfort.</P>
<P>May God Almighty preserve you all by his Power, lest any Strife or Discord be found among you; and may you grow up in Love, and thereby be obliged to bear each others Burdens; and let no transitory Things cumber your Hearts, but be resigned to the Lord; for that to which we are called, is not to be compared to that which is transito∣ry, or perishing; since it is a Treasure that is everlasting, and to which the World, and all that is in it, is but as Dung, because the most glorious Part of it is but Vanity of Vanities. O, my Friends, let none be stopt by that which is an Impediment to entring into the King∣dom of Heaven; but strive all to enter the narrow Gate; and search every one of you your own Hearts, with the Light ye are enlight∣ned with, which shall manifest your own States to you; and keeping there, it shall multiply your Peace, and every one shall find therein his own Teacher, as those have experienced who have sought the Lord with all their Heart. Now the God of all Mercies, who alone is immortal, keep you and us altogether unto the End, that so in these dangerous Times we may remain standing, to the Glory of his great Name. O Friends, keep our Craftiness, and enter not readily into Discourse with those that are out of the Truth; for they speak in their own Wills, and are crafty, and knowing no Bridle to their Mind, it produceth that by which the Simple and innocent are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ught: But stand ye rather, and keep in that wherein ye see their Subtilty; for then, tho' ye may not have a Word to apologize for your selves, yet ye shall be above them.</P>
<P>This is written from me, a young Plant, in Love to you, accord∣ing to the Gift received from the Lord. My Salutation is to you all in the Light of Truth.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In the Year 1664,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A printed Ac∣count of more than 600 of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> in Prison.</NOTE> came forth a small Book in Print, to the King and both Houses of Parliament, wherein were set forth, not only the vio∣lent Persecution almost over all <HI>England,</HI> with the Names of Persons,
<PB N="429" REF="003104_0440_0FEFF76166C293B0"/>
Places, and Cases, which indeed were woful, and some bloody; but it was also represented, that there were at that Time in Prison above six Hundred of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> meerly for Religion's Sake. In the Month called <HI>January,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1664-5 36 condemned to be sent to <HI>Jamaica</HI> by Judge <HI>Keel∣ing, Wild,</HI> and <HI>R. Brown.</HI></NOTE> in the Year 1664-5, thirty six of that Perswasion, among which were eight Women, were condemned to be transported to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> The Jury not being so forward to declare the Prisoners guilty as the Court desired, were perswaded however by the Threat∣nings of Judge <HI>Keeling,</HI> the Recorder <HI>Wild,</HI> and the boisterous <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> to do what was demanded of them. On the 18th and 22d of the next Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">34 more sen∣tenced to <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> and 5 to <HI>Bridewel</HI> by Judge <HI>Wharton.</HI> &amp; Judge <HI>Wind∣ham.</HI></NOTE> thirty four of the said People were sentenced to be carried to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and five to <HI>Bridewel.</HI> The Manner of their Trial I pass by with Silence to avoid Prolixity. Those that were tried on the 18th were sentenced by Judge <HI>Wharton,</HI> and those on the 22d by Judge <HI>Windham,</HI> who said to <HI>Anne Blow,</HI> who declared, that the Fear of the Lord being upon her Heart, she durst not conform to any Thing that was unrighteous, Anne Blow, <HI>I would sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w you as much Favour as the Court will allow you, if you will say that you will go no more to that seditious Meeting,</HI> meaning the <HI>Bull and Mouth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A. Blow</HI>'s An∣swer to Judge <HI>Windham</HI>'s Offer of Fa∣vour.</NOTE> To which she answered, <HI>Wouldst thou have me to sin against that of God in my own Conscience? If I were set at Liberty to Day, if the Lord required it of me, I should go to the</HI> Bull and Mouth <HI>to Mor∣row.</HI> Concerning one <HI>John Gibson,</HI> the said Judge spoke to the Jury in this Manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">J. Gibson.</NOTE> <HI>Gentlemen, altho' it is true, as this</HI> Gibson <HI>saith, that it can∣not be proved that they were doing any Evil at the</HI> Bull and Mouth; <HI>yet it was an Offence for them to be met there, because in Process of Time there might be Evil done in such Meetings; therefore this Law was made to prevent them.</HI> By this we may see with what specious Colours the Persecutors cloak'd their Actions. I find among my Papers a Letter of <HI>John Furly,</HI> and <HI>Wal∣ter Miers,</HI> (both of whom I knew well) mentioning, that some of the Jury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jurymen fi∣ned.</NOTE> for refusing to give such a Verdict as was required of them, were fined in great Sums, and put into Prison, there to remain till they should pay the Fine.</P>
<P>Having now said thus much of sentencing, it grows Time to speak of the Execution thereof.</P>
<P>Some of the Persons ordered for Banishment, fell sick, and died in Prison; some became Apostates, and some were redeemed by their Re∣lations that were not <HI>Quakers.</HI> But yet a considerable Number was, tho' with great Pains, brought on Ship-board, to be transported to the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> We have seen already how those that were sentenced at <HI>Hertford</HI> by Judge <HI>Orlando Bridgeman,</HI> having been put a-shore by the Master of the Ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Friends set on Shore with a Certificate from the Ma∣ster, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who dared not to carry them a∣way for Fear of the Displea∣sure of the Lord.</NOTE> returned. And it was not long after that three of their Friends, being on board the Ship the <HI>Many-fortune</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> were also set on Shore with a Certificate from the Master of the Ship, sign'd by him and seven of his Men, wherein they complained of their Ad∣versity, and said, that God had said as it were in their Hearts, <HI>Accur∣sed be the Man that separates Husband and Wife; and he who oppresseth the Peo∣ple of God, many Plagues will come upon him.</HI></P>
<P>But the first of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who really tasted Banishment, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Edward Brush,</HI> and <HI>James Harding,</HI> who were banished, not only out of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E. Brush</HI> and <HI>Ja. Harding</HI> the first that were banish'd.</NOTE> where they as Citizens had as much Right to live as the chiefest Magistrates, but also out of their native Country, contrary to the Right of a free-born <HI>Englishman:</HI> These, with one <HI>Robert Hayes,</HI> were on the 24th of the Month <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled <HI>March,</HI> early in the Morning, fetch'd from <HI>Newgate</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and brought to <HI>Black-Fryars</HI> Stairs, where they were put into a Boat, and so carried down to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and there had on board a Ship.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R.

he had got nothing to eat before he came to <HI>Gravesend,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1665</NOTE> he was seized in the Ship with so severe Sickness that he died of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dies at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and his Body brought back and buried at <HI>London. E. Brush</HI> lived to return. The Pestilence first breaks out at the next House to where <HI>Edw.</HI> had lived. No Pass to be given to a <HI>West India</HI> Man without Promise to carry some <HI>Quakers</HI> to Banishment. 7 of them put on Ship-board. Pestilence in∣cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ses, and Judge <HI>Hide</HI> an active Per∣secutor dies suddenly.</NOTE> and then his Corps was carried to <HI>London,</HI> and there buried. The other two were car∣ried to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where, by the Providence of God, in Time it fared well with them, and <HI>Edward Brush</HI> lived to return into <HI>England.</HI> It was re∣markable, that not long after these Persons were banished, the Pestilence broke out at <HI>London,</HI> first of all in the House of a Meal-man in <HI>Bear-binder-Lane,</HI> next Door to the House where the said <HI>Edward</HI> liv'd, which by some was thought worthy being taken Notice of; since that House was the first which was shut because of the Sickness.</P>
<P>With the other Prisoners they had more Trouble and Pains, because no Ship-masters could be found that would carry them: Wherefore an Imbargo was laid on all Merchantmen, with Order that none should go down the River without having a Pass from the Admiral; and this they would give to no Master going to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> unless he made Pro∣mise to carry some <HI>Quakers</HI> along with him to the Place to which they were banished. Whatever any Masters spoke against this, intimating that there was a Law, according to which no <HI>Englishman</HI> might be car∣ried out of his native Country against his Mind, was in vain. At length by Force they got one to serve their Turn; and then seven Persons that were sentenced to Banishment, were, on the 18th of the Month call'd <HI>April,</HI> carried from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Black-Fryars</HI>-Stairs, and so in a Boat to <HI>Gravesend.</HI> But in the mean Time the Pestilence increased, and not long after, Judge <HI>Hide,</HI> who had been very active in persecuting, was with many others suddenly taken away out of this Life; for he ha∣ving been seen in the Morning at <HI>Westminster</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Health, as to outward Appearance, it was told in the Afternoon, that he was found dead in his Chamber; being thus summon'd to appear and give Account of his Deeds before a higher Court than ever he presided in. Yet Transpor∣tation was not come to a Stand; first, as hath been said, three Persons were brought on Ship-board, next seven, and on the 16th of the Month called <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8 more put on board.</NOTE> eight were carried down the River to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and put on Ship-board; but as the Number of those that were thus carried away was heightned, so also the Number of those that died of the Pe∣stilence much more increased. But notwithstanding this Scourge from Heaven, Transportation continued; for a Master of a Ship was found at length, who had said, as was reported, <HI>That he would not stick to trans∣port even his nearest Relations.</HI> And so an Agreement was made with him, that he should take between fifty and sixty <HI>Quakers</HI> into his Ship, and carry them to the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> Of these, eight or ten at a Time were brought to the Water-side, and so with Boats or Barges carried to the Ship, which lay at Anchor in the <HI>Thames,</HI> in <HI>Bugbey</HI>'s-<HI>Hole,</HI> a little beyond <HI>Greenwich.</HI> Many of these Prisoners, among which several Women, not shewing themselves ready to climb into the Ship, lest it should seem as if they were instrumental to their Transportation, were hoisted up with the Tackle; and the Sailors being unwilling to do this Work, and saying, <HI>That if they were Merchants Goods, they should not be un∣willing to hoist them in,</HI> the Officers took hold of the Tackle, and said, <HI>They are the King's Goods.</HI> This was on the 20th of the Month call'd <HI>July,</HI> and on the 4th of the next Month, when, according to the Bill of Mortality, three Thousand and forty died in one Week, the rest of the banish'd Prisoners were carried with Soldiers to the said Ship, in which now were fifty five of the banish'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> and among these eighteen Women.<NOTE PLACE="marg">55 <HI>Quakers</HI> put on board one Ship, where many die of the Pestilence.</NOTE> But something adversly hindred this Ship from go∣ing away, and the Pestilence also enter'd into it, which took away many of the Prisoners, and so freed them from Banishment. But tho' the Pestilence grew more hot at <HI>London,</HI> and that a War was risen be∣tween
<PB N="431" REF="003104_0442_0FEFF763FA929160"/>
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> yet the Fire of Persecution continued hot, and great Rejoicings were made wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <HI>Dutch</HI> were beaten at Sea, and their Admiral <HI>Obdam</HI> was blown up with his Ship. Neither did the Persecutors leave off to disturb the Meetings of those called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> and imprison many of them; nay so hardened and unrelenting were some, that when at <HI>London</HI> more than four Thousand People died in one Week, they said, That <HI>the only Means to stop the Pestilence, was to send the</HI> Quakers <HI>out of the Land.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A daring and wicked Saying when more than 4000 dyed in a Week.</NOTE> But these fainted not, but grew em∣boldened against Violence. In <HI>September,</HI> some Meetings were still di∣sturbed at <HI>London,</HI> tho' the Number of the Dead in one Week was heightned to about seven Thousand, being increas'd in that Time nigh two Thousand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meetings still disturb'd tho' above 7000 die in a Week, and Grass grew in the Streets.</NOTE> Now such as intended to have met at the <HI>Bull and Mouth,</HI> were kept out from performing Worship there; but yet meeting in the Street, they were not disturbed; for there seem'd to be some Fear of the common People, who grew discontented because there was little to be earned by Tradesmen; and the City came to be so emptied, that Grass grew in the Streets that used to be the most populous, few Peo∣ple being seen by the Way. Thus the City became as a Desert, and the Misery was so great, that it was believed some died for Want of Attendance.</P>
<P>It was about this Time that <HI>Samuel Fisher,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. Fisher</HI> dieth.</NOTE> who first had been Prisoner at <HI>London</HI> in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and afterwards in <HI>Southwark,</HI> since the Beginning of the Year 1663, till now being about a Year and a Half, died piously. It is reported that the King in the Time of this great Mortality once ask'd, <HI>Whether any</HI> Quakers <HI>died of the Plague?</HI> And having been told, <HI>Yes,</HI> he seemed to slight that Sickness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Because some <HI>Quakers</HI> died of the Plague, the King con∣cluded 'twas no Judgment on the <HI>Perse∣cutors.</HI></NOTE> and to conclude, that then it could not be look'd upon as a Judgment or Plague upon their Presecutors. But certainly his Chaplains might well have put him in Mind of what <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> saith, <HI>There is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked:</HI> And of this Saying of <HI>Job, HE destroyeth the Perfect and the Wicked:</HI> As also that of the Prophet, That <HI>the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</HI></P>
<P>Now travelling in the Country was stopt, which made some People go with Boats along the Coast, and so went a-shore where they had a Mind. Thus did <HI>Stephen Crisp,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S. Crisp</HI> comes to <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>A. Parker,</HI> and <HI>G. White∣head</HI> to <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE> who came about this Time to <HI>York,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> was then, with many of the great ones. About this Time <HI>Alexander Parker</HI> and <HI>George Whitehead</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> where they had good Service in preaching the Truth. Great Fires were now kindled in the Streets to purify the contagious Air; but no Relief was found by it; for in the latter End of <HI>September,</HI> there died at <HI>London</HI> above eight Thousand People in one Week, as I remember to have seen in one of the Bills of Mortality of that Time.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Ship in which the banish'd Prisoners were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship with the condemn'd <HI>Quakers</HI> could not go off, the Master being imprison'd for Deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> could not go off, but continued to lie as a Gazing-stock for those Ships that passed by; for the Master was imprison'd for Debt.</P>
<P>Now the Prediction of <HI>George Bishop</HI> was fulfilled, and the Plagues of the Lord fell so heavily on the Persecutors, that the Eagerness to banish the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and send them away, began to abate. This same <HI>G. Bishop,</HI> about <HI>Midsum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Bishop</HI> then a Priso∣ner at <HI>Bristol,</HI> writes a Let∣ter to comfort his Friends under Appre∣hension of Ba∣nishment.</NOTE> writ from the Prison at <HI>Bristol</HI> (where he made Ac∣count that he also should have been banished) a Letter to his Friend to exhort them to Stedfastness, foretelling them, that if they happen'd to be banish'd, <Q>God would give them Grace in the Eyes of those among whom they should be sent, if they continued to adhere to him; and that when he should have try'd them, he should bring them again into their native Country; and that none should ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t them out; but they should be planted and built up there; and that the Lord should visit their Enemies with the Sword and Pestilence, and strike them with Terror.</Q> This is but a short Hint of what he writ at large.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="003104_0443_0FEFF722CED69968"/><HI>G. Fox</HI> the Younger had also in the Year 1661, given forth a little Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

And that this Decree of the Lord was so firm, that tho' some of the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Children and Prophets should appear so as to stand in the Gap, yet should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot that alter his Decree.</HI> This with much more he writ very plainly; and tho' he was deceased long ago, yet this Paper was reprinted, to shew the Inhabitants Low faithfully they had been warned.</P>
<P>What,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I. Penning∣ton</HI> writes to the King and Parliament to manifest the Unreasonable∣ness of Perse∣cution.</NOTE> <HI>Isaac Penington,</HI> being a Prisoner, writ about this Time to the King and Parliament, and published in Print, was also very remark∣able, being designed with Christian Meekness, to disswade them, if pos∣sible, from going on with this mischievous Work of Persecution. In this Paper, containing some Queries, among many weighty Expressions, I find these also,</P>
<P><HI>After ye have done all ye can, even made Laws as strong as ye can, and put them in the strictest Course of Execution ye can, one Night from the Lord may end the Controversie, and shew whether we please the Lord in obeying him, or ye in making Laws against us for our Fidelity and Obedience to him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as the Lord is able to overturn you, so if ye mistake your Work, misin∣terpreting the Passages of his Providence, and erring in Heart concerning the Ground of his former Displeasure; and so (thro' the Error of Judgment) set your selves in Opposition against him replanting the Plants which he will not have grow, and plucking up the Plants of his planting; do ye not in this Case provoke the Lord, even to put forth the Strength which is in him against you? We are poor Worms. Alas, if ye had only us to deal with, we should be nothing in your Hands! But if his Strength stand behind us, we shall prove a very bur∣densome Stone, and ye will hardly be able to remove us out of the Place wherein God hath set us, and where he pleaseth to have us disposed of. And happy were it for you, if instead of persecuting us, ye your selves were drawn to wait for the same Begettings of God (which we have felt) out of the Earthly Nature into his Life and Nature, and did learn of him to govern in that; then might ye be established indeed, and be freed from the Danger of those Shakings and Overturnings, which God hastening upon the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now because ye may be apt to think that I write these Things for my own Sake, and the Sakes of my Friends and Companions in the Truth of God, that we might escape the Sufferings and Severity which we are like to undergo from you; and not so mainly and chiefly for your Sakes, lest you should bring the Wrath of God and Misery upon your Souls and Bodies: To prevent this Mistake in you, I shall add what followeth. Indeed this is not the Intent of my Heart: For I have long expected, and do still expect this Cup of outward Affliction and Persecution from you, and my Heart is quieted and satisfied therein, knowing that the Lord will bring Glory to his Name, and Good to us out of it: But I am sure it is not good for you to afflict us for that which the Lord requireth of us, and wherein he accepteth us; and ye will find it the bitterest Work that ever ye went about, and in the End will wish that the Lord had rather never given you this Day of Prosperity, than that he should suffer you thus to make Ʋse of it. Now that ye may the more clearly see the Temper of my Spirit, and how my Heart stands in this Thing, I shall a little open unto you my Faith and Hope about it in these ensuing Particulars.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="003104_0444_0FEFF7250BC492C0"/><HI>First, I am assured in my Heart and Soul, that this despised People (called</HI> Quakers,) is of the Lord's begetting in his own Life and Nature. Indeed had I not seen the Power of God in them and received from the Lord an unquestio∣nable Testimony concerning them, I had never looked towards them: For they were otherwise very despisable in my Eyes. And this I cannot but testifie con∣cerning them, that I have found the Life of God in me owning them, and that which God hath begotten in my Heart, refreshed by the Power of Life in them: And none but the Lord knows the Beauty and Excellency of Glory, which he hath hid under this Appearance.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Lord hath hitherto preserved them against great Oppositions, and is still able to preserve them. Every Power hitherto hath made nothing of over-running them; yet they have hitherto stood, by the Care and tender Mercy of the Lord; and the several Powers which have persecuted them, have fallen one after another.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I have had Experience my self of the Lord's Goodness and Preser∣vation of me, in my suffering with them for the Testimony of his Truth, who made my Bonds pleasant to me, and my noisom Prison (enough to have destroy∣ed my weakly and tenderly-educated Nature) a Place of Pleasure and Delight, where I was comforted by my God Night and Day, and filled with Prayers for his People, as also with Love to, and Prayers for those who had been the Means of outwardly afflicting me and others upon the Lord's Account.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly, I have no Doubt in my Heart that the Lord will deliver us. The Strength of Man, the Resolution of Man is nothing in my Eye in Compare with the Lord. Whom the Lord loveth, he can save at his Pleasure. Hath he be∣gun to break our Bonds and deliver us, and shall we now distrust him? Are we in a worse Condition than</HI> Israel <HI>was, when the Sea was before them, the Moun∣tains on each Side, and the</HI> Aegyptians <HI>behind pursuing them? He indeed that looketh with Man's Eye, can see no Ground of Hope, nor hardly a Possibility of Deliverance; but (to the Eye of Faith) it is now nearer than when God began at first to deliver.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, It is the Delight of the Lord, and his Glory to deliver his People, when to the Eye of Sense it seemeth impossible. Then doth the Lord delight to stretch forth his Arm, when none else can help: And then doth it please him to deal with the Enemies of his Truth and People, when they are lifted up above the Fear of him, and are ready to say in their Hearts concerning them, They are now in our Hands, who can deliver them?</P>
<P><HI>Well, were it not in Love to you, and in Pity, (in relation to what will cer∣tainly befall you, if ye go on in this Course) I could say in the Joy of my Heart, and in the Sense of the Good-will of my God to us, who suffereth these Things to come to pass,</HI> Go on, try it out with the Spirit of the Lord, come forth with your Laws, and Prison, and spoiling of our Goods, and Ba∣nishment, and Death <HI>(if the Lord please)</HI> and see if ye can carry it: <HI>For we come not forth against you in our own Wills, or in any Enmity against your Persons or Government, or in any Stubborness or Refractoriness of Spirit; but with the Lamb-like Nature which the Lord our God hath begotten in us, which is taught and enabled by him, both to do his Will, and to suffer for his Name-sake. And if we cannot thus overcome you (even in Patience of Spirit, and in Love to you) and if the Lord our God please not to appear for us, we are content to be overcome by you. So the Will of the Lord be done, saith my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>This the Author concludes with a Postscript, containing a serious Exhortation to forsake Evil. Besides this, he gave forth another Pa∣per, wherein he proposed this Question to the King and both Houses of Parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Whether Laws made by Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See his Works, <HI>P. 410.</HI></NOTE> in Equity, ought to extend any farther than there is Power in Man to obey? And if it was not cruel to require Obedience in such Cases, wherein the Party hath not a Capacity in him of obeying?</HI> And to
<PB N="434" REF="003104_0445_0FEFF72714D63698"/>
explain this a little farther, he said, <HI>In Things concerning the Worship of God, wherein a Man is limited by God, both what Worship he shall perform, and what Worship he shall abstain from, here he is not left at Liberty to obey what Laws shall be made by Man contrary hereunto.</HI> Thus <HI>Pennington</HI> strove by Writing to shew the Persecutors the Evil of their Doings: But a fierce Party prevailed then; and the Clergy continually blew the Fire of Persecution; nay, many presumed the Time was now come, totally to destroy the <HI>Quakers;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12 more con∣demned to be transported.</NOTE> and that in <HI>December</HI> twelve more were condem∣ned to Transportation.</P>
<P>Concerning those banished that were now in the Ship which lay in the <HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

The Jury then being called to be sworn, and three Officers of the Court having deposed, <HI>That the Oath had been tendred to him at the last Assizes, according to the Indictment,</HI> the Judge said, <HI>It was not done in a Corner:</HI> And then asked him, <HI>What he had to say to it?</HI> And, <HI>Whether he had taken the Oath at the last Assizes? G. Fox</HI> thereupon gave an Account of what had been done then, and that he had said, <HI>That the Book they gave him to swear on, saith, Swear not at all.</HI> And repeating more of what he spoke then, the Judge said, <HI>I will not dispute with you, but in Point of Law. G. Fox</HI> offering to speak something to the Jury concerning the Indictment, he was stopt by the Judge; and then <HI>G. Fox</HI> asked him, <HI>Whether the Oath was to be tendred to the King</HI>'s <HI>Subjects only, or to the Subjects of Foreign Princes?</HI> The Judge replied, <HI>To the Subjects of this Realm.</HI> Well, said he, <HI>Look to the Indictment, and thou mayst see that the Word</HI> Subject <HI>is left out of this Indictment also.</HI> Several other great Errors as to Time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he had observed in the Indictment, but no sooner had he spoke concerning the Errors, but the Judge cried, <HI>Take him away, Jailor, take him away.</HI> Then he was hurried away; yet the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> thought he should have been called again; but that was not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. After he was gone, the Judge asked the Jury, <HI>Whether they were agreed▪</HI> They said, <HI>Yes,</HI> and found for the King against him. The Reason why <HI>G. Fox</HI> was led away so suddenly, seemed to be that they expect∣ed he would have proved the Officers of the Court to have sworn falsly, seeing the Day on which the Oath had been tendred to him at the Assizes before, was wrong in the Indictment; and yet they had sworn, that on that Day he had refused to take the Oath. Before <HI>G. Fox</HI> was brought before the Judge, he had passed Sentence of <HI>Pre∣munire</HI> against <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> for having refused to take the Oath. And tho' this Sentence had not been passed against <HI>G Fox,</HI> yet he was re∣corded as a premunired Person; tho it had not been asked him, <HI>What he had to say why Sentence should not be pronounced against him.</HI> And thus he continued Prisoner in <HI>Lancaster</HI>-Castle.</P>
<P>Whilst he was there, tho' weak of Body, he writ several Papers. But the neighbouring Justices laboured much to get him removed from thence to some remote Place; for it was pretty well known among the People, how the Court at the Assizes had dealt with him. So about six Weeks after, they got an Order from the King and Council to re∣move him from <HI>Lancaster;</HI> and they received also a Letter from the Earl of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> wherein it was written, <HI>That if these Things which he was charged with were found true against him, he deserved no clemency or Mercy.</HI> And yet the greatest Matter they had against him was his Re∣fusal of the Oath. His Persecutors now having prepared for his Re∣moval,
<PB N="435" REF="003104_0446_0FEFF766E1440978"/>the Under-Sheriff, and the Head-Sheriff's Men, with some Bailiffs, came and fetch'd him out of the Castle, when he was so weak, by lying in that cold, wet and smoaky Prison, that he could hardly go or stand. So they brought him down into the Jailor's House, where Justice <HI>William Kirbey,</HI> and several others were.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice <HI>Kir∣bey,</HI> &amp;c. con∣trive <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Removal▪ tho' weak, and send him to <HI>Bentham</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> but refuse to shew their Or∣der.</NOTE> They called for Wine to give him, but he well knowing their Malice against him, told them, <HI>He would have none of their Wine.</HI> Then they cry'd, <HI>Bring out the Hor∣ses. G. Fox</HI> therefore desired, That <HI>if they intended to remove him, they would first shew him their Order, or a Copy of it.</HI> But they would not shew him any, but their Swords. He then told them, <HI>There was no Sentence passed upon him, neither was he premunired, that he knew of; and therefore he was not made the King's Prisoner, but was the Sheriff's: For they and all the Country knew that he was not fully heard at the last Assizes, nor suffered to shew the Errors that were in the Indictment, which were sufficient to quash it. And that they all knew there was no Sentence of Premunire passed upon him; and therefore he not being the King's Prisoner, but the Sheriff's, desired to see their Order.</HI> But instead of shewing him their Order, they haled him out, and lifted him upon one of the Sheriff's Horses; for he was so very weak, that he was hardly able to sit on Horseback. Riding thus along the Street, he was much gazed upon by the People, and had great Reason to say, that <HI>he received neither Christianity, Civility, nor Hu∣manity;</HI> for how ill and weak soever he was, yet they hurried him away about fourteen Miles, to <HI>Bentham,</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> and so wicked was the Jailor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abusive Beha∣haviour of one <HI>Hunter,</HI> a Jailor, who di∣ed soon after.</NOTE> one <HI>Hunter,</HI> a young Fellow, that he lasht the Horse on which <HI>G. Fox</HI> rid, with his Whip, to make him skip and leap; insomuch that he had much ado to sit him; and then would this wanton Fellow come, and looking him in the Face, say, <HI>How do you, Mr.</HI> Fox? To which he answered, <HI>It was not civil in him to do so.</HI> Yet this malicious Fellow seem∣ed little to regard it; but he had not long Time to delight in this kind of Insolence; for soon after he was cut off by Death. <HI>G. Fox</HI> being come down to <HI>Bentham,</HI> was met by a Marshal and several Troopers; and many of the Gentry, besides Abundance of People, came thither to stare at him. Being entred the House, and very much tired, he desi∣red they would let him lie down on a Bed, which the Soldiers permit∣ted; and the Marshal, to whom he was delivered, set a Guard upon him. After having staid there a while, they press'd Horses, and sending for the Bailiff and the Constables, they had him to <HI>Giggleswick</HI> that Night. And there they raised the Constables,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> remo∣ved to <HI>Gig∣gleswick.</HI></NOTE> who sat drinking all Night in the Room by him, so that he could get but little Rest. The next Day coming to a Market-Town, several of his Friends came to see him; and at Night he asked the Soldiers, <HI>Whither they intended to carry him?</HI> To which some said, <HI>Beyond Sea,</HI> and others, <HI>To</HI> Tinmouth <HI>Castle.</HI> And there was a Fear amongst them, lest some should rescue him; but there was not the least Reason for it. The next Night he was brought to <HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence to <HI>York.</HI></NOTE> where the Marshal put him into a great Chamber, where many of the Troopers came to him. He then speaking something by Way of Exhortation to the Soldiers, many of them were very loving to him. A while after, the Lord <HI>Frecheville,</HI> who commanded those Horse, came to him, and was civil and loving, and <HI>G. F.</HI> gave him an Account of his Imprisonment.</P>
<P>After a Stay of two Days at <HI>York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And thence to <HI>Scarborough</HI>-Castle, where he is ill used by the Gover∣nour, Sir <HI>J. Crosland,</HI> a Papist.</NOTE> the Marshal and five Soldiers were sent to convey him to <HI>Scarborough</HI>-Castle: These were very civil, and behaved themselves civilly to him. On the Way they baited at <HI>Mal∣ton,</HI> and permitted his Friends to see him. Afterwards being come to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> they brought him to an Inn, and gave Notice of it to the Governour, who sent six Soldiers to guard him that Night. The next Day they had him into the Castle, and there put him into a Room,
<PB N="436" REF="003104_0447_0FEFF7294AB001F8"/>
with a Centinel to watch him. Out of this Room they soon brought him into another, which was so open, that the Rain came in, and it smoaked exceedingly; which was very offensive to him. One Day the Governor Sir <HI>John Crosland,</HI> came into the Castle with one Sir <HI>Francis Cob. G. F.</HI> desired the Governor to come into his Room, and see how it was; and so they did: And <HI>G. F.</HI> having got a little Fire made in the Room, it was so filled with Smoke, that they could hardly find the Way out again. And he being a Papist, <HI>G. F.</HI> told him, <HI>That was his Purgatory which they had put him into.</HI> For it plainly appeared that there was an Intent to vex and distress him: For after he had been at the Charge of laying out about fifty Shillings, to keep out the Rain, and somewhat to ease the Smoke, they put him into a worse Room, which had neither Chimney nor Fire-hearth; and lying much open toward the Sea-side, the Wind so drove in the Rain, that the Water not only ran about the Room, but also came upon upon his Bed. And he having no Fire to dry his Clothes when they were wet, his Body was so be∣nummed with Cold, and his Fingers swelled to that Degree, that one grew as big as two. And so malicious were his Persecutors, that they would hardly suffer any of his Friends to come at him, nay not so much as to bring him a little Food; so that he was forced to hire somebody to bring him Necessaries. Thus he spent about a Quarter of a Year; and afterwards being put into a Room where a Fire could be made, be hir'd a Soldier to fetch him what he wanted. He then eat almost nothing but Bread, and of this so little, that a Three-penny Loaf commonly served him three Weeks; and most of his Drink was Water, that had Wormwood steeped in it; and once when the Wea∣ther was very sharp, and he had taken great Cold, he got some Ele∣campane Beer.</P>
<P>Now tho' he desired his Friends and Acquaintance might be suffered to come to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Friends desiring it, not permitted to come to him, while many Papists and o∣thers have Li∣berty, with whom he con∣verses freely.</NOTE> yet this was refused; but some others were admitted to come and gaze vpon him, especially Papists, of whom a great Com∣pany once being come, they affirmed, <HI>That the Pope was infallible, and had been so ever since St.</HI> Peter's <HI>Time.</HI> But <HI>G. F.</HI> denied this, and alledged from History, <Q>That <HI>Marcellinus,</HI> one of the Bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> denied the Faith, and sacrificed to Idols; and therefore was not infallible. And he said also, If the Papists were in the infallible Spirit, they should not maintain their Religion by Jails, Swords, Gallows, Fires, Racks and Tortures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor want such Means to hold it up by: For if they were in the infallible Spirit, they would preserve Mens Lives, and use none but spiritual Weapons about Religion.</Q> He also told them, how a certain Woman, that had been a Papist, but af∣terwards entred into the Society of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> having a Tailor at work at her House, and speaking to him concerning the False∣ness of the Popish Religion, was threatned to have been stabb'd by him, for which End he drew his Knife at her: Since it was as the Woman said, <HI>the Principle of the Papists, if any turn from their Religion, to kill them if they can.</HI> This Story he told the Papists, and they did not deny this to be their Principle, but ask'd, <HI>If he would declare this abroad?</HI> And he said, <HI>Yes, such Things ought to be declared abroad, that it may be known how contrary your Religion is to true Christianity.</HI> Whereupon they went away in a great Rage. Some Time after, another Papist came to dis∣course with him, and said, That <HI>all the Patriarchs were in Hell, from the Creation till Christ came; and that when he suffered, he went into Hell, and the Devil said to him, What comest thou hither for; to break open our strong Holds? And Christ said, To fetch them all out. And so,</HI> he said, <HI>Christ was three Days and three Nights in Hell, to bring them all out.</HI> On Which <HI>G. F.</HI> said to him, <HI>That was false; for Christ said to the Thief, This
<PB N="437" REF="003104_0448_0FEFF768824A5D60"/>
Day thou shalt be with me in Paradice.</HI> He also said, <HI>That</HI> Enoch <HI>and</HI> Elijah <HI>were translated into Heaven; and that</HI> Abraham <HI>also was in Heaven, since the Scripture saith, that</HI> Lazarus <HI>was in his Bosom. And</HI> Moses <HI>and</HI> Elias <HI>were with Christ upon the Mount, before he suffered.</HI> With these In∣stances he stopt his Adversary's Mouth, and put him to a Nonplus.</P>
<P>Another Time there came to him a great Physician called Dr. <HI>Witty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Witty,</HI> a Presbyterian, accompanied with the Lord <HI>Falconbridge</HI> and other great Men, discourses with him.</NOTE> being accompanied with the Lord <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> the Governor of <HI>Tin∣mouth</HI> Castle, and several Knights; and <HI>G. F.</HI> being called to them, this Doctor undertook to discourse with him, and asked, <HI>What he was in Prison for? G. F.</HI> told him, <HI>Because he would not disobey the Command of Christ, and swear.</HI> To which the Doctor said, <HI>He ought to swear his Allegiance to the King.</HI> Now <HI>G. F.</HI> knowing him to be a great <HI>Presbyte∣rian,</HI> asked him, <HI>Whether he had not sworn against the King and the House of Lords, and taken the</HI> Scotch <HI>Covenant? And whether he had not since sworn to the King?</HI> The Doctor having no ready Answer to this, <HI>G. F.</HI> asked him, <HI>What then was his Swearing good for?</HI> telling him farther, <HI>My Allegiance doth not consist in Swearing, but in Truth and Faithfulness.</HI> Af∣ter some further Discourse, <HI>G. F.</HI> was led away to his Prison again; and afterwards the Doctor boasted, <HI>That he had conquered</HI> George Fox, which he having heard, told the Governor, <HI>It was a small Boast in him to say he had conquered a Bondman.</HI></P>
<P>A while after, this Doctor came again, having many great Persons with him, and he affirmed before them all, That <HI>Christ had not enlight∣ned every Man that cometh into the World; that the Grace of God, which brought Salvation, had not appeared unto all Men; and that Christ had not died for all Men. G. F.</HI> asked him, <HI>What Sort of Men those were, which Christ had not enlightned?</HI> and <HI>whom his Grace had not appeared to?</HI> To which the Doctor answered, <HI>Christ did not die for Adulterers, and Idolaters, and wicked Men.</HI> Then <HI>G. F.</HI> asked him, <HI>Whether Adulterers and wicked Men were not Sinners?</HI> And he said, <HI>Yes.</HI> Which made <HI>G. F.</HI> say, <HI>And did not Christ die for Sin∣ners? Did he not come to call Sinners to Repentance? Yes,</HI> said the Doctor. <HI>Then,</HI> reply'd <HI>G. F. Thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st stopt thy own Mouth.</HI> And so he proved, <Q>That the Grace of God had appeared to all Men, tho' some turned it into Wantonness, and walked despitefully against it; and that Christ had enlightned all Men, tho' some hated the Light.</Q> Several of those that were present confessed, it was true; but the Doctor went away in a Rage, and came no more to him.</P>
<P>Another Time the Governor came to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Governor, with some Parliament-Men, come to talk with him.</NOTE> with two or three Parlia∣ment-Men, and they asked him, <HI>Whether he owned Ministers and Bishops?</HI> To which he said, <HI>Yes, such as Christ sent forth, such as had freely received, and would freely give and such as were qualified, and were in the same Power and Spirit, that they were in, in the Apostles Days. But such Bishops and Teachers as yours are, that will go no farther than they have a great Benefice, I do not own; for they are not like the Apostles: For Christ saith to his Mini∣sters,</HI> Go ye into all Nations, and preach the Gospel. <HI>But ye Parliament-Men, that keep your Priests and Bishops in such great fat Benefices, ye have spioled them all: For do ye think they will go into all Nations to preach, or will go any further than they have great fat Benefices? Judge your selves, whether they will or no.</HI> To this they could say little; and whatever was objected to <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he always had an Answer in Readiness; and because some∣times it was simple and plain, his Enemies from thence took Occasion to say, that he was a Fool. But whatever such said, it is certain, that he had a good Understanding, tho' he was not educated in humane Learning. This I know by my own Experience, for I have had fami∣liar Conversation with him.</P>
<P>In this his Prison he was much visited even by People of Note. Ge∣neral <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s Widow came once to him with a great Company, one
<PB N="438" REF="003104_0449_0FEFF71B1BB761F8"/>
of which was a Priest, who began to quarrel with him, because speak∣ing to one Person he said, <HI>Thou and Thee,</HI> and not <HI>You;</HI> and those that spoke so, the Priest said <HI>He counted but Fools.</HI> Which made <HI>G. F.</HI> ask him, <HI>Whether they that translated the Scriptures, and that made the</HI> Grammar <HI>and</HI> Accidence, <HI>were Fools? Seeing they translated the Scriptures so, and made the</HI> Grammar <HI>so,</HI> Thou <HI>to one, and</HI> You <HI>to more than one?</HI> With these and other Reasons he soon silenced the Priest; and several of the Com∣pany acknowledged the Truth he declared to them, and were loving to him; and some of them would have given him Money; but he would not receive it.</P>
<P>Whilst I leave him yet Prisoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of <HI>W. Dundas,</HI> his Convince∣ment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> I'll go to other Matters, and relate the remarkable Case of one <HI>William Dundas,</HI> who being a Man of some Repute in <HI>Scotland,</HI> came over to the Communion of those called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> in a singular Manner. He was a Man of a strict Life, and obser∣ved the ecclesiastical Institutions there as diligently as any of the most precise: But in Time he saw, that bodily Exercise profited little, and that it was true Godliness which the Lord required from Man. In this State becoming more circumspect than he was accustomed to be, he did not frequent the publick Assemblies so much as formerly. But this was soon taken Notice of; and being asked the Reason why, he said, <HI>That there was a Thing beyond that, which he looked for.</HI> But it was told him, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> was a dangerous Principle.</HI> To which <HI>Dundas</HI> replied, <HI>That he was not to receive the Law from the Mouth of Man.</HI> Then the Minister (so called) said to him, <HI>That he tempted God.</HI> To which <HI>Dundas</HI> returned, <HI>That God could not be tempted to Evil.</HI> Now that which made him more averse to the Priests of that Nation, was to see their domineering Pride, and how they forced some that were not one with them in their Prin∣ciples, to comply with their Institutions, sprinkling the Children of Parents even without their Consent. Add to this, their going from one Benefice to another, being always ready to go over from a small Church to a great one, under Pretence of more Service for the Church; whereas it plainly appeared that selfish Interest generally was the main Cause. This Behaviour of the Clergy, and their rigid Persecution, if any deviated a little from the Church-Ceremonies, and the common Form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hard Case of one <HI>Wood,</HI> a Custom-house Officer.</NOTE> turned <HI>Dundas</HI>'s Affection from them. An Instance of this Ri∣gidness, was, that one— <HI>Wood,</HI> who had some Charge in the Custom-house of <HI>Leith,</HI> and approved in some Respect the Doctrine of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> had said, <HI>That Christ was the Word, and that the Letter was not the Word.</HI> For this he was cited before the ecclesiastical Assembly of <HI>Lothian,</HI> where <HI>Dundas</HI> was present; and <HI>Wood</HI> so well defended his Saying, that none were able to overthrow his Arguments, chiefly drawn from these Words of <HI>John, That the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us. Wood</HI> continuing to maintain his Assertion, they began to threaten him with Excommunication, and would not allow him so much Time as to give his Answer to the next Assembly. Excom∣munication there was such a Penalty, that People under it were very much deprived of Conversation with Men. The Fear of this made <HI>Wood</HI> comply in a little Time; and meeting <HI>Dundas</HI> about three Months after, in the Street at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he told him, <HI>That he had been forced to bow to the Assembly against his Light; for if he had been excommunicated, he had lost his Livelyhood.</HI> Thus <HI>Wood</HI> bowed thro' humane Fear, but he hardly out-lived this two Years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Priests jealous of <HI>Dundas,</HI> open his Letters at the Post-house, and find he corresponds with <HI>G.

<P>In the mean while the Priests became more and more jealous of <HI>Dun∣das:</HI> For he not having them in such an Esteem as they wished, they said, <HI>That he would infect the whole Nation:</HI> And they did not stick here, but to know with whom he corresponded in <HI>England,</HI> they opened (so great was their Power) his Letters at the Post-house, and sometimes
<PB N="439" REF="003104_0450_0FEFF76B1139C270"/>
kept them: But if they found nothing in them, by which they could prejudice him, they caused them to be sealed up again, and delivered to him. By this base Practice they came to know that one <HI>Gawen Law∣ry,</HI> Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> sent him a Box, with about three Pounds Sterling worth of Books.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest <HI>Oswald</HI> seizes his Books.</NOTE> This <HI>Box, Dundas</HI> found afterwards, that the Priest <HI>John Oswald</HI> had taken away: And whatever he did, he could not get them again, till the <HI>English</HI> came into <HI>Scotland,</HI> but then many of them were wanting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">At length he is excommu∣nicated.</NOTE> <HI>Dundas</HI> in the mean while unwilling to comply with the Kirk, was at length excommunicated: But he was generally so well esteemed, that none seemed to regard that Sentence so as to keep at a Distance from him; which made this Act the more contemptible. Now tho' <HI>Dundas</HI> favoured the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet they were such a despised People, that he, who was a Man of some Account in the World, could not as yet give up to join with them.</P>
<P>It happened once that he was riding from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to his House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defends a <HI>Quaker</HI> as∣saulted on the Road.</NOTE> in a Winter-Evening, and hearing a Noise of some Men as if Fighting, he bad his Man ride up in Haste to see what it was; which he did, and calling out, said, that there were two Men on Horse-back beating of another on Foot. <HI>Dundas</HI> riding up to them, saw the two beating the other Man, who said to them, <HI>What did I say to you, but bid you fear God?</HI> By this <HI>Dundas</HI> presently perceived that the Man thus beaten was a <HI>Quaker;</HI> and asking his Name, which the other telling, he knew it, tho' he did not know the Man by Sight; and then he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell a beating the two with his Rod, and ordered those that were with him, to carry them to the next Prison: But the said <HI>Quaker</HI> intreated him to let them go; which he did after having ask'd their Names and Dwelling-Pla∣ces. About a Week after, the said <HI>Quaker</HI> told a Relation of <HI>Dundas</HI> what Kindness he shewed him, and how he had in some Manner been saved by him; <HI>Yet,</HI> said he, <HI>I found the same Spirit in him that was in the other two Men who beat me.</HI> Such a Saying as this would have offended some Men, but with <HI>Dundas</HI> it had a contrary Effect; for these Words so reached him, that some Time after meeting the said <HI>Quaker</HI> again, he desired, <HI>That as he passed that Way, he would make his House his lodging Place.</HI> Which kind Invitation he seemed not unwilling to accept o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Dundas</HI> had now attained to so much Experience, that he could discern between the Spirits of Meekness and Rashness, and sufficiently perceive that the said <HI>Quaker</HI> by that which he spoke concerning him had not made himself guilty of the Latter: But yet he could not bow so low, as to join in Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' secretly he endeavoured more and more to live up to their Doctrine; and therein he enjoyed more Peace in his Heart than formerly.</P>
<P>But his outward Condition in the World not being very forward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes into <HI>France,</HI> and settles at <HI>Diep.</HI></NOTE> he went into <HI>France,</HI> and settled at <HI>Diep.</HI> Whilst he dwelt there, a certain Woman out of <HI>England</HI> came thither with her Maid, and spread in the Town some Books of <HI>George Fox</HI> and <HI>William Dewsbury</HI> translated into <HI>French;</HI> and she her self having written some Papers, got them turn'd into <HI>French</HI> by <HI>Dundas,</HI> and so distributed them. But the Message she chiefly came for, she hid from him, and that not without Reason; for what she acted there, was so singular, that if it had been known be∣fore, it is probable she would not have been able to perform it. Tho' I do not find what her Intent was in the Thing, yet it seems likely to me, that she not knowing the Language there spoken, would by a Sign testify against their Pride in Apparel and Dress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Acti∣on of an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Woman at the Protestants Place of Wor∣ship there.</NOTE> and that on this wise: On the first Day of the Week she came to the Meeting-house of the Protestants there, where some Thousands of People were met, and having set her self in the most conspicuous Place, just over against him that preached, before the Service was finished, she stood up with
<PB N="440" REF="003104_0451_0FEFF7AE5BBE3028"/>
the Maid that was with her, who taking off a Mantle and Hood she was covered with, she appeared clothed in Sack-cloth, and her Hair hanging down sprinkled with Ashes. Thus she turned her self round several Times, that all the People might see her. This Sight struck both Preacher and Auditory with no small Consternation; and the Preacher's Wife afterwards telling somebody how this Sight had af∣fected her, said, <HI>This is of deeper Reach than I can comprehend.</HI> The said Women having stood thus a while, fell both down upon their Knees and pray'd, and then went out of the Meeting, many following them, and distributed some Books. Then they came to their Lodging, which was in a <HI>Scotchman</HI>'s House; but he refusing them Entrance, they came to <HI>Dundas</HI>'s Lodging, who knew nothing of all this. They therefore told him, that the Work they came for in that Nation was now done; and he asking what they had done, they told him; and signified that they wanted Lodging till they went away. Then he went abroad to see if he could find Lodging for them; but in vain; he then offered them his Bed, being willing to shift for himself some where else, but they refused to accept of his Offer; and his Landlady not being wil∣ling to let them sit up that Night in any of her Rooms, they were fain to stay that Night in an Out-House.</P>
<P>Now this Business had made such a Stir in Town, that one of the King's Officers coming the next Day to <HI>Dundas,</HI> told him, <HI>That he had transgressed the Laws of the Nation, by receiving Persons of another Religion to his Lodging; for the King tolerated only two Religions,</HI> viz. Papists <HI>and</HI> Pro∣testants. To this <HI>Dundas</HI> said, <HI>That he had not transgressed the Law of Hos∣pitality, and he had been forced to do so, since he could not let them lie in the Street, where they would have been in Danger of their Lives by the rude Multi∣tude.</HI> Then the Women were taken away, and sent to Prison; and they not being provided with Food, <HI>Dundas</HI> took Care of that. Some Time after, an Order being come from the Parliament at <HI>Roan,</HI> it was read to them, viz. <HI>That they should be transported forthwith back to</HI> England, <HI>with the first Passage-boat, and all their Papers and Books to be burnt in the Market, and themselves also, if ever they should come to that Nation again.</HI> In Pursuance of this, they were put into a Passage-boat in the Night-time, and so sent to <HI>England.</HI> Afterwards the People at <HI>Diep</HI> intended to pursue <HI>Dun∣das,</HI> as one of their Judgment; but he was unwilling to be looked upon as such, tho' the Protestants had inform'd against him, <HI>That he did not come to their Meeting:</HI> But of this no Crime could be made; and <HI>Dundas</HI> told them, <HI>If they persecuted him, being a Merchant, and trafficking there, they might expect the like to be done to their Merchants in</HI> England. And when the Judge affirmed, <HI>that</HI> Dundas <HI>was of the Judgment of those Women,</HI> he told him, <HI>That they were better than he; but that their Way was too strait for him to walk in.</HI> There fell out two Things which <HI>Dundas</HI> took singular Notice of; the one was, that the <HI>Scotchman</HI> who shut out the Women, died within twelve Months after; and the other, that the House of his Landlady, who refused them a Chamber to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it in, was burnt within the said Time, without its being known whence the Fire came, no Houses being burnt besides, tho' it was in the Middle of the Town.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Dundas</HI> continued in an unquiet Condition; for by Reason of Human Fear, he found himself too weak to profess publick∣ly before Men what he believed to be Truth.</P>
<P>Then he went to <HI>Roan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dundas</HI> comes to <HI>Roan,</HI> and thence spreads many Books written by Friends.</NOTE> but could get no Rest there, being some∣what indispos'd in Body, and having from <HI>England</HI> gotten a great many Books treating of the Doctrine of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> he sent some of them to the Judge Criminal at <HI>Diep,</HI> and some to the Jesuits College there, and at <HI>Paris.</HI> Afterwards he spread some Books also at <HI>Caen,</HI> where many Protestants lived. But since those Books spoke against the

<HI>Papists,</HI> and the <HI>Calvinists</HI> were in Fear that thereby they might be brought to Sufferings, they complained to the Lieutenant General of the Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Then goes to <HI>Alencon,</HI> where the Judge Crimi∣nal is kind to him, but the Jesuits much offended.</NOTE> of <HI>Dundas,</HI> as one that did not come to their Meeting. By this he was forced to leave that Place, and went to <HI>Alencon,</HI> where staying a while, the Judge Criminal sent for him; and after a long Discourse, he and <HI>Dundas</HI> agreed so well, that he invited him to come and see him oftner, and that if he would, he might have an Oppor∣tunity to discourse with some of the Jesuits. But <HI>Dundas</HI> told him, <HI>That he was not willing to dispute with any; yet he should not be afraid to maintain his Principles against all the Jesuits of the Nation.</HI> This being told the Jesuits, it so exasperated them against him, that being once out of Town, they caused his Chamber-Door to be broken up, to search his Lodging. He complaining of this to the Judge Criminal, the Judge told him, <HI>He knew nothing of it, and if there was any Thing, it did proceed from the Jesuits, because of his Confidence against them.</HI> This seem'd not improbable, for he found his Letters opened at the Post-house several Times, and when he challenged the Post-master, he re∣ceived for an Answer, That <HI>they came so to him.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after he returned to <HI>Caen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to <HI>Caen</HI> and <HI>Diep,</HI> and so goes to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> where he frequents Friends Meet∣ings, and at last becomes one with them.</NOTE> where he was not long, but his Correspondent at <HI>Alencon</HI> sent him Word, That the Day after he went from thence, the Governor of the Town had been at his Lodg∣ing to seek for him.</P>
<P>In the next Year, when a War arose between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> he came again to <HI>Diep,</HI> in Order to return to <HI>England,</HI> having got Passage in Company of the Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> Ambassador from <HI>England,</HI> where being arrived, he frequented the Meetings of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet he was not bold enough to own the Name of <HI>Quaker,</HI> but continu'd in the common Way of Salutations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet at length the Truth they pro∣fess'd had such Power over him, that not being able to enjoy Peace without yielding Obedience to the inward Convictions upon his Mind, he at length gave up, and so entred into their Society, and obtain'd true Peace with the Lord, which he had long reason'd himself out of. In Process of Time he publish'd a Book in Print, from which I have drawn this Relation, which he concluded with a Poem, in which he thank'd God for his singular Dealings and Mercies bestowed upon him, wishing that others might reap Benefit by it.</P>
<P>Thus parting with <HI>William Dundas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>W. Caton,</HI> with a short Character of him.</NOTE> I am now to say that in this Year 1665, in <HI>December, William Caton</HI> died at <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> He was a Man not only of Literature, and zealous for Religion, but of a cour∣teous and affable Temper and Conversation, by which he was in good Esteem among those he was acquainted with: And as to the Respect he had there, this may serve as an Instance. <HI>Holland</HI> at this Time be∣ing in War with <HI>England,</HI> there were several <HI>English</HI> Prisoners of War in the Prison of the Court of Admiralty at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who now and then were visited by <HI>Caton,</HI> and supply'd with some Sustenance: But in this he was hindred by an Officer of that Court, who seemed offended because <HI>Caton</HI> did not give him Hat-honour. This gave Occasion to <HI>Caton</HI> to complain of it to a Burgo-master of the City, I think the Lord <HI>Cornelius Van Vlooswyh,</HI> who at that Time was one of the Lords of the Admiralty; he bid <HI>Caton</HI> come to his House at such a Time as he was to go to the Court; which he did, and went with the said Burgoma∣ster towards the Court; where being come, and Entrance denied him by the said Officer, the Burgomaster charged him, not to hinder <HI>Caton</HI> from visiting the Prisoners.</P>
<P>About this Time a Law was made in <HI>England,</HI> called, <HI>An Act for re∣straining</HI> Non-Conformists <HI>from inhabiting in Corporations.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="442" REF="003104_0453_0FEFF7B25F329280"/><P>WHereas divers Parsons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for restraining Non confor∣mists from in∣habiting in Corporations.</NOTE> Vicars, Curates, Lecturers, and other Persons in Holy Orders, have not declared their unfeigned As∣sent and Consent to the Use of all Things contained and prescribed in the Book of Common-Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the Use of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or have not subscribed to the Declaration or Acknowledgment contained in a certain Act of Parliament made in the fourteenth Year of his Majesty's Reign, and entitled, <HI>An Act for the Ʋniformity of Publick Prayers, and Administration of Sacraments, and o∣ther Rites and Ceremonies, and for the Establishing the Form of Making, Or∣daining and Consecrating of Bishops, Priests and Deacons in the Church of</HI> Eng∣land, according to the said Act, or any other subsequent Act. And whereas they or some of them, and divers other Person and Persons not ordained according to the Form of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and as have since the Act of Oblivion taken upon them to preach in unlaw∣ful Assemblies, Conventicles or Meetings, under Colour or Pretence of Exercise of Religion, contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, have settled themselves in divers Corporations in <HI>England,</HI> sometimes Three or more of them in a Place, thereby taking an Op∣portunity to distil the poisonous Principles of Schism and Rebellion to the Hearts of his Majesty's Subjects, to the great Danger of the Church and Kingdom:</P>
<P N="2">II. Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Tem∣poral, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the said Parsons, Vicars, Curates, Lecturers, and other Persons in holy Orders, or pretended holy Orders, or pretending to holy Orders, and all Stipendaries, and other Persons who have been possessed of any Ecclesiastical or Spiritual Promotion, and every of them, who have not declared their unfeigned Assent and Consent as aforesaid, and subscribed the Declaration aforesaid, and shall not take and subscribe the Oath following;</P>
<P>(2.) I <HI>A. B.

<P>Now tho' this Act was chiefly made against the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and <HI>In∣dependents,</HI> who formerly had been employ'd in the publick Church, yet they suffered but little by it; but it was cunningly made Use of to vex the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who because for Conscience-sake they could not swear, were on this Law prosecuted and imprison'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now since the Pestilence had been so fierce this Year at <HI>London,</HI> that about an hundred Thousand People were swept away by it and other∣wise, and also many of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> there must be consequent∣ly many poor Widows and Fatherless Children among those of that Society:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise of Womens monthly Meet∣ings.</NOTE> And because the Men, who at Times kept Meetings to take Care for the Poor, found that this Burden grew too heavy for them, they offer'd Part of this Service and Care to the most grave and so∣lid Women of their Church, who for this Service met once a Week at <HI>London,</HI> and this in Time gave Rise to the Womens Monthly Meetings in other Places in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="003104_0454_0FEFF77004228C48"/>Now I return to the Ship with the banish'd Prisoners, which I left lying in the <HI>Thames:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship with the banished Prisoners comes into the <HI>Downs,</HI> one half of them being dead. 1665-6.</NOTE> But the Owners having put in another Master, whose Name was <HI>Peter Love,</HI> the Ship after long lingring, left the Ri∣ver, and came into the <HI>Downs.</HI> In the Month called <HI>January</HI> of the Year ensuing, <HI>Luke Howard</HI> writ from <HI>Dover,</HI> that of fifty four banish∣ed Persons, who almost half a Year ago had been brought on Ship∣board, but twenty seven remained, the rest being dead.

And so they weighed Anchor, and went down the Channel as far as <HI>Plymouth,</HI> where after some Stay, they set Sail again, which was on the 23d of the Month called <HI>February:</HI> But the next Day being advanced as far as the Land's-end, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateer came and took the Ship; and to avoid being retaken, went about the Backside of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and so after three Weeks came with some of the Banish'd to <HI>Horn</HI> in <HI>North-Holland;</HI> and some Days after, the Prize, with the rest of them enter'd also into that Port. Here they were kept some Time in Prison; but the Commissioners of the Admiralty having understood, that there was no Likelihood to get the banished <HI>Quakers</HI> exchanged for <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoners of War in <HI>England,</HI> re∣solved to set them at Liberty, and gave them a Letter of Passport, and a Certificate, 'That they had not made an Escape, but were sent back by them.' They coming to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> were by their Friends there provided with Lodging and Clothes; for their own had been ta∣ken from them by the Privateers Crew; and in Process of Time they all returned to <HI>England,</HI> except one, who not being an <HI>Englishman,</HI> stay'd in <HI>Holland.</HI> Thus those banished were delivered, and the De∣sign of their Persecutors was brought to nought by an Almighty Hand.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>G. Fox</HI> continu'd Prisoner in <HI>Scarborough</HI> Castle, where the Access of his Friends was denied him, tho' People of other Perswasions were admitted.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> in <HI>Scarborough</HI> Castle has a Conference with Dr. <HI>Cra∣dock,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Once came to him one Doctor <HI>Cradock</HI> with three Priests, accompanied with the Governour, and his Wife, and many besides. <HI>Cradock</HI> ask'd him, <HI>What he was in Prison for?</HI> He an∣swered, <HI>For obeying the Command of Christ and the Apostle in not swearing: But if he, being both a Doctor and a Justice of Peace, could convince him, that after Christ and the Apostle had forbidden swearing, they commanded Chri∣stians to swear, then he would swear. Here's a Bible,</HI> continu'd he, <HI>shew me any such Command if thou canst.</HI> To this <HI>Cradock</HI> said, <HI>It is written, ye shall swear in Truth and Righteousness. Ay,</HI> said <HI>G. F. it was written so in</HI> Jeremiah's <HI>Time, but that was many Ages before Christ commanded</HI> Not to swear at all: <HI>But where is it written so since Christ forbad all Swearing? I could bring as many Instances out of the Old Testament for swearing as thou, and it may be, more too, but of what Force are they to prove Swearing lawful in the New Testament, since Christ and the Apostle forbad it? Besides, where it is written,</HI> Ye shall swear, <HI>was this said to the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>or to the</HI> Jews? To this <HI>Cradock</HI> would not answer; but one of the Priests said, <HI>It was to the</HI> Jews. <HI>Very well,</HI> said G. F. <HI>but where did God ever give a Com∣mand to the</HI> Gentiles <HI>to swear? For thou knowest that we are</HI> Gentiles <HI>by Nature. Indeed,</HI> said <HI>Cradock, in the Gospel-time every thing was to be esta∣blished out of the Mouths of two or three Witnesses, and there was to be no swearing then. Why then,</HI> returned <HI>G. F. dost thou force Oaths upon Christians, contrary to thine own Knowledge in the Gospel Times? And why dost thou ex∣communicate my Friends? Cradock</HI> answered, <HI>For not coming to Church. Why,</HI>
<PB N="444" REF="003104_0455_0FEFF7B69E6B1C00"/>
said <HI>G. F. ye left us above twenty Years ago,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1666</NOTE> <HI>when we were but young, to the</HI> Presbyterians, Independents, <HI>and</HI> Baptists, <HI>many of whom made Spoil of our Goods, and persecuted us because we would not follow them: Now we being but young, knew little then of your Principles, and those that knew them should not have fled from us, but ye should have sent us your Epistles or Homilies; for</HI> Paul <HI>writ Epistles to the Saints, tho' he was in Prison: But we might have turned</HI> Turks <HI>or</HI> Jews <HI>for ought we had from you for Instruction. And now ye have excommunicated us, that is, ye have put us out of your Church, be∣fore ye have got us into it, and before ye have brought us to know your Prin∣ciples. Is not this Madness in you to put us out, before we were brought in? But what dost thou call the Church,</HI> continu'd he. <HI>That which you,</HI> replied <HI>Cradock, call the Steeple-house.</HI> Then <HI>G. F.</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Whether Christ's Blood was shed for the Steeple-house, and purify'd and sanctify'd it with his Blood? And seeing</HI> (thus continu'd he) <HI>the Church is Christ's Bride and Wife, and that he is the Head of the Church, dost thou think the Steeple-house is Christ's Wife and Bride? And that he is the Head of that old House, or of his People? No,</HI> said <HI>Cradock, Christ is the Head of the People, and they are the Church. But,</HI> reply'd <HI>G. F. ye have given that Title to an old House, which belongs to the People, and ye have taught People to believe so.</HI> He ask'd him also, <HI>Why he persecuted his Friends for not paying Tythes? And whether God did ever give a Command to the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>that they should pay Tythes? And whether Christ had not ended Tythes, when he ended the</HI> Levitical-<HI>Priesthood that took Tythes? And whether Christ, when he sent forth his Disciples to preach, had not commanded them to</HI> preach freely, as he had given them freely? <HI>And whether all the Ministers of Christ were not bound to observe this Command of Christ? Cradock</HI> said, <HI>He would not dispute that:</HI> And being unwilling to stay on this Subject, he turned to another Matter; but finding <HI>G. F.</HI> never to be at a Loss for Answer, and that he could get no Advantage on him, he at length went away with his Company. With such kind of People <HI>G. F.</HI> was often troubled while he was Prisoner there; for most that came to the Castle would speak with him, and many Disputes he had with them. But as to his Friends, he was as a Man buried alive, for very few of them were suffered to come to him. <HI>Josiah Cole</HI> once desi∣ring Admittance, the Governor told him, <HI>You are an understanding Man, but</HI> G. Fox <HI>is a meer Fool.</HI> Now tho' the Governour dealt hardly with him, yet in Time he alter'd, for having sent out a Privateer to Sea, they took some Ships that were not their Enemies, which brought him into some Trouble; after that, he grew somewhat more friendly to <HI>G. F.</HI> to whom the Deputy Governor said once, <HI>That the King know∣ing that he had a great Interest in the People, had sent him thither, that if there should be any stirring in the Nation, they should hang him over the Wall.</HI> And among the <HI>Papists,</HI> who were numerous in those Parts, there was much Talk then of hanging <HI>G. F.</HI> But he told them, <HI>If that was it they desired, and it was permitted them, he was ready, for he never feared Death nor Sufferings in his Life; but was known to be an innocent peaceable Man, free from all Stirrings and Plottings, and one that sought the Good of all Men.</HI> But the Governor now growing kinder, <HI>G. F.</HI> spoke to him when he was to go to the Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> and desired him to speak with <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Marsh,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Cob,</HI> and some others, and to tell them, how long he had lain in Prison, and for what.

<P>The very next Day after <HI>G. F.</HI> was released,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fire breaks out at <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> the Fire broke out at <HI>London,</HI> and the Report of it came quickly down into the Country, how that City was turned into Rubbish and Ashes, (insomuch that after an incessant Fire which lasted near four Days, but little of old <HI>London,</HI> was left standing) there being about thirteen thousand and two hundred Houses burnt; the Account whereof hath been so cir∣cumstantially described by others, that I need not treat of it at large; but I can't omit to say, that <HI>Thomas Briggs,</HI> some Years before passing thro' the Streets of <HI>London,</HI> preacht Repentance to the Inhabitants; and coming thro' <HI>Cheapside,</HI> he cry'd out, That <HI>unless</HI> London <HI>repented, as</HI> Nineveh <HI>did, God would destroy it.</HI></P>
<P>Now I may relate another remarkable Prediction.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Ibbit</HI> of <HI>Huntingtonshire</HI> came to <HI>London</HI> a few Days before the burning of that City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Destruc∣tion foretold by <HI>T Briggs.</HI></NOTE> and (as hath been related by Eye-Witnesses) did upon his coming thither, alight from his Horse, and unbutton his Cloaths in so loose a Manner, as if they had been put on in haste just out of Bed.</P>
<P>In this Manner he went about the City on the 6th (being the Day he came thither) and also on the 7th Day of the Week, pronouncing a Judgment by Fire which should lay Waste the City. On the Evening of these Days some of his Friends had Meetings with him, to enquire concerning his Message and Call to pronounce that impending Judg∣ment: In his Account whereof he was not more particular and clear, than that he said he for some Time had the Vision thereof, but had delayed to come and declare it as commanded, until he felt (as he ex∣press'd it) the Fire in his own Bosom: Which Message or Vision was ve∣ry suddenly proved to be sadly true, as the foregoing brief Account doth in Part declare. The Fire began on the 2d of <HI>September,</HI> 1666, on the first Day of the Week, which did immediately follow those two Days the said <HI>Thomas Ibbit</HI> had gone about the City declaring that Judgment.</P>
<P>Having gone up and down the City, as hath been said, when after∣wards he saw the Fire break out, and beheld the fulfilling of his Pre∣diction,
<PB N="446" REF="003104_0457_0FEFF7B996F4FFB8"/>a spiritual Pride seized on him, which, if others had not been wiser than he, might have tended to his utter Destruction: For the Fire being come as far as the East-end of <HI>Cheapside,</HI> he plac'd himself be∣fore the Flame, and spread his Arms forth, as if to stay the Progress of it; and if one <HI>Thomas Matthews,</HI> with others had not pull'd him (who seem'd now altogether distracted) from thence, it was like he might have perish'd by the Fire. Yet in Process of Time, as I have been told, he came to some Recovery, and confess'd this Error; an evident Proof of human Weakness, and a notorious Instance of our Frailty, when we assume to our selves the doing of any Thing, to which Heaven alone can enable us. I can't well pass by without taking Notice of it, that about three Weeks before the said Fire, the <HI>English</HI> landed in the Island <HI>Schelling</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> under the Conduct of Captain <HI>Holmes,</HI> and setting the Town on Fire, there were above three hundred Houses burnt down, belonging mostly to <HI>Baptists</HI> that did not bear Arms. It may be farther observed, that the <HI>English</HI> were beaten at Sea this Summer by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> under the Conduct of Admiral <HI>De Ruiter,</HI> in a Fight which lasted four Days; so that they had Occasion to call to Mind how often the Judg∣ments of God had been foretold them, which now came over their Country, <HI>viz.</HI> Pestilence, War and Fire.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> being at Liberty, did not omit to visit his Friends, and in their Meetings to edify them with his Exhortations, whereby others also sometimes came to be convinc'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

Fox <HI>again, he would have his Life, or he should have his.</HI> But now his Wife was not only become one of <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Friends, but this Priest himself favoured the Doctrine professed by his Wife, and was very kind to <HI>G.

<P>In this County <HI>G.

F.</HI> who now coming to <HI>Sinderhill-Green,</HI> had a large Meeting there, where the Priest sent the Constable to the Justices for a Warrant; but the Notice being short, the Way long, and having spent Time in searching for <HI>G.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM the more drawn forth at this Time to visit you with an Epistle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of <HI>Step. Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p's</HI> Epis∣tle to Friends concerning the present and succeeding Times.</NOTE> because the Lord hath given me some Sight of his great and dreadful Day, and Workings in it, which is at Hand, and greatly hastens, of which I have something to say unto you, that ye may be prepared to stand in his Day, and may behold his wondrous Work∣ing among his Enemies, and have Fellowship with his Power there∣in, and may not be dismayed nor driven away in the Tempest, which will be great.</P>
<P>And as concerning those succeeding Times, the Spirit of the Lord hath signified, that they will be Times of Horrour and Amaze∣ment to all that have, and yet do reject his Counsel: For as the Days of his Forbearance, Warning and Inviting, have been long, so shall his Appearance amongst those that have withstood him, be fierce and terrible; even so terrible, as who shall abide his Coming? For the Lord will work both secretly and openly, and his Arm shall be ma∣nifest to his Children in both.</P>
<P>Secretly he shall raise up a continual fretting Anguish among his Enemies, one against another, so that being vexed and tormented in∣wardly, they shall seek to make each other miserable, and delight therein for a little Season; and then the Prevailer must be prevailed over, and the Digger of the Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must fall therein; and the Confidence that Men have had one in another shall fail, and they will beguile and betray one another, both by Counsel and Strength; and as they have banded themselves to break you, whom God hath gathered, so shall they band themselves one against another, to break, to spoil and destroy one another; and thro' the Multitude of their Treacheries, all Credit or Belief, upon the Account of their solemn Engagement, shall fail; so that few Men shall count themselves, or what is theirs, safe in the Hand of his Friend, who hath not chosen his Safety and Friendship in the pure Light of the unchangeable Truth of God; and all the secret Counsels of the Ungodly shall be brought to nought, sometimes by the Means of some of themselves, and sometimes by Impossibilities lying in their Way, which shall make their Hearts fail of ever accomplishing what they have determined; and in this State shall Men fret themselves for a Season, and shall not be able to see the Hand that turns against them, but shall turn to fight against one Thing, and another, and a third Thing, and shall stagger and reel in Counsel and Judgment, as drunken Men that kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w not where to find the Way to Rest; and when they do yet stir themselves up against the holy People, and against the holy Covenant of Light, and them
<PB N="448" REF="003104_0459_0FEFF7BBD7BC2FE8"/>
that walk in it, they shall but the more be confounded; for they shall be helped with a little Help, which all the Ungodly shall not hinder them of, to wit, the secret Arm of the Lord, maintaining their Cause, and raising up a Witness in the very Hearts of their Adversaries to plead their Innocency, and this shall make them yet the more to vex themselves, and to go thorough hard-bestead; for when they shall look upward to their Religion, to their Power, Policy, or Preferments, or Friendships, or whatsoever else they had trusted in, and relied upon, they shall have cause to curse it; and when they look downwards to the Effects produced by all those Things, behold then Trouble, and Horrour, and Vexation takes hold on them, and drives them to Darkness; and having no Help but what is Earthly, and being out of the Knowledge of the mighty overturning Power of the Lord God Almighty, they shall despair and wear out their Days with Anguish; and besides all this, the terrible Hand of the Lord is, and shall be openly manifested against this ungodly Generation, by bringing grievous and terrible Judgments and Plagues upon them, tumbling down all Things in which their Pride and Glory stood, and overturning, overturning even the Foundations of their Strength; yea, the Lord will lay waste the Mountain of the Ungodly, and the Strength of the fenced City shall fail, and when Men shall say, <HI>We will take Refuge in them,</HI> Nah. iii. 12, 13. they shall become but a Snare, and there shall the Sword devour: And when they shall say, <HI>We will go into the Field, and put Trust in the Number and Courage of our Soldiers,</HI> they shall both be taken away; and this Evil also will come of the Lord, and his Hand will be stretched out still, and shall bring Confusion, Ruin upon Ruin, and War upon War; and the Hearts of Men shall be stirred in them, and the Nations shall be as Waters, into which a Tempest, a swift Whirlwind is entred, and even as Waves swell up to the Dissolution one of another, and breaking one of another, so shall the Swellings of People be: And because of the Hardship and Sorrow of those Days, many shall seek and desire Death rather than Life.</P>
<P>Ah! My Heart relents, and is moved within me in the Sense of these Things, and much more than I can write or declare, which the Lord will do in the Earth, and will also make haste to accomplish a∣mong the Sons of Men, that they may know and confess, <HI>That the Most High doth rule in the Kingdoms of Men, and pulleth down and setteth up ac∣cording to his own Will: And this shall Men do before seven Times pass over them, and shall be content to give their Glory unto him that sits in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh Friends! while all these Things are working and bring∣ing to pass, repose ye your selves in the Munition of that Rock that all these Shakings shall not move, even in the Knowledge and Feeling of the eternal Power of God, keeping you subjectly given up to his hea∣venly Will, and feel it daily to kill and mortify that which remains in any of you, which is of this World; for the worldly Part in any, is the changeable Part, and that is up and down, full and empty, joyful and sorrowful, as Things go well or ill in the World: For as the Truth is but one, and many are made Partakers of its Spirit; so the World is but one, and many are Partakers of the Spirit of it; and so many as do partake of it, so many will be straitned and perplexed with it; but they who are single to the Truth, waiting daily to feel the Life and Virtue of it in their Hearts, these shall rejoice in the Midst of Adver∣sity; these shall not have their Hearts moved with Fear, nor tossed with anguish because of evil Tydings, <HI>Psal.</HI> cxii. 7, 8 because that which fixeth them remains with them: These shall know their En∣trance with the Bridegroom, and so be kept from Sorrow, tho' his

Coming be with a Noise; and when a Midnight is come upon Man's Glory, yet they being ready and prepared, it will be well with them, and having a true Sense of the Power working in them∣selves, they cannot but have Unity and Fellowship with the Works of it in the Earth, and will not at all murmur against what is, nor wish nor will what is not to be; these will be at rest till the Indig∣nation passeth over, and these having no Design to carry on, nor no Party to promote in the Earth, cannot possibly be defeated, nor disappointed in their Undertakings.</P>
<P>And when you see Divisions, and Parties, and Rendings in the Bowels of Nations, and Rumours and Tempests in the Minds of People, then take heed of being moved to this Party, or to that Party, or giving your Strength to this or that, or counselling this Way or that Way, but stand single to the Truth of God, in which neither War, Rent, nor Division is; and take heed of that Part in any of you, which trusts and relies upon any Sort of the Men of this World, in the Day of their Prosperity; for the same Party will bring you to suffer with them in the Time of their Adversity, which will not be long after; for Stability in that Ground there will be none: But when they shall say, <HI>Come join with us in this or that,</HI> remember you are joined to the Lord by his pure Spirit, to walk with him in Peace and in Righteousness, and you feeling this, this gathers out of all Bustlings, and Noises, and Parties, and Tu∣mults, and leads you to exalt the Standard of Truth and Righte∣ousness, in an innocent Conversation, to see who will flow unto that; and this shall be a Refuge for many of the weary, tossed, and afflicted Ones in those Days, and a Shelter for many whose Day is not yet over.</P>
<P>So dearly beloved Friends and Brethren, who have believed and known the blessed Appearance of the Truth, let not your Hearts be troubled at any of these Things: Oh, let not the Things that are at present, nor Things that are yet to come, move you from Stedfast∣ness, but rather double your Diligence, Zeal, and Faithfulness to the Cause of God: For they that know the Work wrought in them∣selves, they shall rest in the Day of Trouble: <HI>Yea, tho' the Fig-tree fail, and the Vine brings not forth, and the Labour of the Olive-Tree ceaseth, and the Fields yeild no Meat, and Sheep be cut off from the Fold, and there be no Bullocks in the Stall, yet then may'st thou rejoice in the Lord, and sing Praises to the God of thy Salvation,</HI> Hab. iii. 16, 17.</P>
<P>And how near these Days are to this poor Nation, few know, and therefore the Cry of the Lord is very loud unto its Inhabitants, thro' his Servants and Messengers, that they would prize their Time while they have it, lest they be overturned, wasted, and laid desolate be∣fore they are aware; and before Destruction come upon them, and there be no Remedy, as it hath already done upon many.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>London! London!</HI> That thou and thy Rulers would have considered, and hearkned and heard, in the Day of thy Warnings and Invitations, and not have persisted in thy Rebellion, till the Lord was moved against thee, to cut off the Thousands and Multitudes from thy Streets, and the pressing and thronging of People from thy Gates, and then to destroy and ruin thy Streets also, and lay desolate thy Gates, when thou thoughtest to have replenish'd them again.</P>
<P>And, Oh! saith my Soul, that thy Inhabitants would yet be warned, and persuaded to repent and turn to the Lord, by putting away every one the Evil that is in their Hearts, against the Truth in your selves, and against those that walk in it, before a greater Desolation and Destruction overtake you.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="003104_0461_0FEFF7BDD52BF7B8"/>Oh, What shall I say to prevail with <HI>London,</HI> and with its Inha∣tants! The Lord hath called aloud, he hath roared out of <HI>Sion</HI> unto them, but many of them have not hearkened at all, nor considered at all.</P>
<P>Well, O my Friends, (and thou, O my Soul) return to your Rest, dwell in the Pavillion of the House of your God, and my God, and shelter your selves under the Shadow of his Wings, where ye shall be Witnesses of his Doings, and see his <HI>strange Act</HI> brought to pass, and shall not be hurt therewith, nor dismayed.</P>
<P>Oh, my Friends, in the Bowels of dear and tender Love, have I signified these Things unto you, that you might stand armed with the whole Armour of God, cloathed in Righteousness, and your Feet shod with the Preparation of the Gospel of Peace; and freely given up in all Things to the disposing of the Lord, who will deliver us, not by Might, nor by Sword, nor Spear, but by his own eternal, invi∣sible Arm, will he yet save us and deliver us, and get himself a Name by preserving of us; and we shall yet live to praise him who is worthy of Glory, of Honour and Renown, from the rising of the Sun, to the Setting of the same, now and for ever, <HI>Amen, Amen,</HI> saith my Soul.</P>

<P>In the Year 1667,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1667</NOTE> a Book came forth in Print at <HI>London,</HI> with this Title,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A short Ac∣count of the arbitrary and violent Pro∣ceedings of Justice <HI>Ar∣morer</HI> at <HI>Reading,</HI> &amp;c. In particular against <HI>Tho. Curtis</HI> and Family.</NOTE> <HI>Persecution appearing with its open Face in</HI> William Armorer. This was written by some of the Prisoners called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and contained a Relation of the impetuous Carriage of the said <HI>Armorer,</HI> who be∣ing a Knight and Justice of Peace, had made it his Business many Years one after another, to persecute the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and from Time to Time to disturb their Religious Meetings. From a Multitude of Cases I meet with in the said Book, I'II pick out but a few. The aforesaid <HI>Armorer</HI> came very often to the House of <HI>Thomas Curtis,</HI> at <HI>Reading,</HI> to disturb the Meeting, taking many Persons Pri∣soners from thence, particularly once thirty four, both Men and Women, at a time. And when they were brought to their Trial, the Oath was tendered them as the most ready Means to ensnare and to keep them in Prison. Among the Prisoners taken out of the Meeting was one <HI>Henry Pizing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. Pizing,</HI> no <HI>Quaker,</HI> brought a∣mong others before Judge <HI>T. Holt.</HI></NOTE> who coming to the Bar with his Hat in his Hand, Judge <HI>Thomas Holt</HI> said, <HI>Here's a Man that hath some Man∣ners,</HI> and asked him, <HI>If he would take the Oath of Allegiance?</HI> To which <HI>Pizing</HI> answered, <HI>He had taken it twice already.</HI> But said the Judge, <HI>You were no</HI> Quaker <HI>then.</HI> To which the said <HI>Henry</HI> reply'd, <HI>Neither am I now; but have been many Weeks among them, and I never met with any H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt by them, but found them to be honest and civil People.</HI> Upon which <HI>William Armorer,</HI> who had taken him Prisoner, said, <HI>Why did not you tell me so before?</HI> To which <HI>Henry</HI> returned, <HI>Your Worship was so wrathful, that you would not hear me.</HI> Then the Judge said, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must take the Oath again.</HI> The Oath being read, he took it, upon which they let him go free without paying any Fees. But they required of him, <HI>to go out at a Back-door, and to come no more among the</HI> Quakers. But <HI>Pizing</HI> told them, <HI>He hoped now he was freed, he might go out at which Door he would.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Curtis</HI> afterwards being called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho. Curtis <HI>examined.</HI></NOTE> the Judge asked him, <HI>If he would take the Oath of Allegiance?</HI> To which he answered, That <HI>he did not refuse the Oath upon the account of not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing Allegiance to the King, but because Christ had Commanded not to swear at all: For he was perswaded that he had manifested himself to be as good a Subject to the King as most in the County, since he came into it, and that if he could take any Oath, ei∣ther to save his Estate or Life, he profess'd he would begin with that Oath.</HI> Then he desired, <HI>That the Court would be pleased to let some of their Ministers<PB N="451" REF="003104_0462_0FEFF7796E9FAB40"/>
shew him by the Scriptures, how he might take it, and not break the Com∣mand of Christ.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Priest <HI>Worrel</HI> called to satis∣fie <HI>T.

Ay,</HI> said <HI>Curtis, This is commonly the Answer we have from these Men, when they are desired to answer us a Question according to the Scripture; for when we make it appear that they give no satisfactory Answer to the Question, they use to say, We are obstinate. Curtis</HI> (whole Wire <HI>Anne</HI> was a Daughter of a Sheriff of <HI>Bristol,</HI> that had been hang'd near his own Door, for endeavouring to bring in the King) was released after some small Time; but quickly taken Prisoner again by <HI>Armorer,</HI> who perceiving that he intended to have gone to <HI>Bristol</HI>-Fair, caused him to be brought to an Inn, where he told him, <HI>You are going to</HI> Bristol-<HI>Fair, but I will stop your Journey.</HI> And then commanding the Constable to carry him to Prison, he was com∣pelled thither without a <HI>Mittimus.</HI></P>
<P>About this Time <HI>Curtis</HI>'s imprison'd Friends writ a Paper, and it is like he had a Hand in it, to shew tho Hurt and Mischief proceeding from Swearing. This Paper being sent by him to one of the Magi∣strates, and Leave being given given him to read it in the Council-Chamber, at the reading of these Words, <HI>Because of swearing the Land mourns,</HI> Alderman <HI>Johnson</HI> said, <HI>That was very true.</HI></P>
<P>Sometime after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bold Extra∣vagancies of Justice <HI>Ar∣morer</HI> at and in the House of <HI>T. Curtis,</HI> &amp;c</NOTE> it happen'd that <HI>T. curtis,</HI> his Wife, and Man-Ser∣vant being all Prisoners, <HI>Armorer</HI> sent his Man to enquire if there were any in the House more than the Family, to which the Maid having answered <HI>No,</HI> a little after, <HI>Armorer</HI> came himself, and knockt at the Door; but the Maid being in Fear, did not open it.<HI>Armorer</HI> then pulling an Instrument out of his Pocket, pickt the Lock, enter'd the House, and searching from Room to Room, came at length where he found one <HI>Joseph Coale,</HI> who dwelt in the House, and was not well at that Time; and <HI>Armorer</HI> taking him by the Arm, and pulling him down Stairs, said to him, <HI>Will you take the Oath of Allegiance?</HI> Which he refusing, was sent to the House of Correcton, whither the Day before, seven Women, taken from a Meeting, had also been brought. This bold Act of picking the Lock he did at other Times also, and once when the Maid was gone out to carry some Victuals to her Master and Mistress in Prison. In the mean while he searched the Warehouse, where was much Cloth; and to a Woman that was there, and spoke against his picking of the Locks, he said, <HI>What have you do with it?</HI> And where's that <HI>Where?</HI> meaning the Maid-Servant. The Women answered him, <HI>She had to do with it; for she was soe that no body did s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal any Thing out of the House.</HI> Besides, <HI>Armorer</HI> continually made it his Business to disturb the Meeting, which commonly was twice Week; and then he used to curse, and to strike those he found there with a great Cane, always sending some to Prison. Having once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three Women to be brought before him from the House of Correction, he would have them pay a Fine for having been at a Meeting; to which one <HI>Anne Harrison</HI> said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His illegal Treatment of <HI>A. Harrison.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Thou hast got our House already that we built, and hast taken away our Means; and would'st thou have me pay more Money when I have broken no Law? We were but four above the Age of sixteen Years, and the Act says, it must be above Four.</HI> To which <HI>Armorer</HI> said, <HI>His Man told him they were six; and two of them ran away. It is false,</HI> said <HI>Anne, there was</HI> Frances Kent, <HI>but she being a Midwife, was fetch'd out of Town; and as for the Sixth, she was not there. But Armorer not regarding what∣ever Anne</HI> said spoke in a rude Manner, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have Mrs.</HI> Kent, <HI>and then let the best Lady in the Land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her; she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not go, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> send for her.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="003104_0463_0FEFF7C0E65FA778"/>If I should mention all the Enormities of <HI>Armorer</HI>'s violent Behavi∣our, this Relation must needs be very large, and therefore I pass by the most Cases, and touch but on some few. More than once it hap∣pen'd, when the Prisoners, being brought to their Trial, reproved <HI>Ar∣morer</HI> because of his Injustice, and put him in mind, <HI>That once he must give an Account for his bad Deeds;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Profane∣ness.</NOTE> He in a most impudent Manner, said, <HI>You shall see at the Day of Judgment, whose Arse will be blackest, yours or mine.</HI> And when a Prisoner told him, <HI>It was an uncivil thing for one called a Justice, to speak such Words.</HI> He reply'd, <HI>Why Sirrah, what Incivility is it? Is not your Nose your Nose, and your Arse your Arse?</HI> Other Ab∣surdities the Prisoners met with in the Court, I pass by, as also how from Time to Time they were treated when they refused the Oath. From what hath been said already in more than one Place concerning the like Cases, one may easily guess how matt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs were transacted here, which sometimes was so grossly, that the Spectators shewed their Dislike. When once the Jury, for want of good Witnesses, could not agree to find the Bill, <HI>Armorer</HI> rose off the Bench, and appeared as a Wit∣ness. But notwithstanding the Jury returning the second Time brought it in <HI>Ignoramus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther In∣stances of his arbitrary Do∣ings.</NOTE> Upon which the other Justice said to them, <HI>That Sir</HI> William Armorer, <HI>an honourable Gentleman had taken his Oath also,</HI> To which the Jury returned, <HI>'Twas true, Sir</HI> William Armorer <HI>was an honour∣able Gentleman, but was a Man Subject to Passion.</HI> And they continuing, un∣willing to bring in the Prisoners guilty, the two Justices <HI>Proctor</HI> and <HI>Armo∣rer,</HI> (for there were then no more on the Bench) for all that would not discharge the Prisoners, but sent them to Jail again, as seditious Persons; for <HI>Proctor</HI> had told the Jury the Day before, <HI>That if they did not bring in the Prisoners guilty, they would make</HI> W. Armorer <HI>and the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk perjured Per∣sons. Anne</HI> the Wife of <HI>T. Curtis</HI> being called to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and asked if she would take the Oath, said, <HI>I look on it as a very hard Thing, that I should be required to take this Oath, being under Covert, and my Husband being here a present Sufferer for the very same thing; for there is no other Woman in</HI> England, <HI>that I have heard of, under Covert, that is required to take that Oath, and kept in Prison on that Account.</HI> But <HI>Armorer</HI> full of Passion, cry'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Malice in particular against <HI>Anne Curtis.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hold your Tongue,</HI> Nan, <HI>and turn your Back.</HI> And so she, with another Woman, that had also been required to take the Oath, was sent back to Jail, as dangerous and suspected Persons. At length some Justices procured her Liberty; but this so displeased <HI>Armorer,</HI> that he did not rest before he had her in Prison again: But others, it seems, so eagerly desired her Liberty, that she was discharged a second Time, tho' her Husband's Goods and Money were seized. How a Prisoner, who spoke something in his own Defence, was threatned to be gagg'd, how Girls were sent to the House of Correction, and how <HI>Armorer</HI> com∣ing in Winter-time into the Meeting, and having got a Bucket of Wa∣ter into the Room, he himself threw it with a nasty Bowl in the Fa∣ces of some young Maidens, I cursorily skip over. He seemed exceed∣ingly offended at <HI>Anne Curtis,</HI> who being a witty Woman, did not omit, when Occasion was offered, to tell of his uncivil Behaviour; and therefore he soon had her in Jail again; and when it was proposed in the Summer-time to discharge some of the Prisoners, because of the extream hot Weather, provided they gave Security, <HI>No,</HI> said <HI>Armorer, Mrs.</HI> Curtis <HI>shall not go out, tho' she would give Security; but she shall lie in Jail till she rot.</HI> But how wicked soever he was, yet he could not pre∣vent that all his exorbit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Carriage against the <HI>Quakers</HI> was published in Print.</P>
<P>But such Behaviour was at that Time no rare or uncommon Thing; for since Persecution was continually cloak'd with a Pretence of Rebel∣lion and Sedition, all over the Country, such were found, who to their

But this his Teme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity he did not out-live long: For as he was going half un∣drest to his Chamber to Bed, he fell down Stairs, as was concluded from the Circumstances; for he was found lying on the Floor, with his Skull broken, wrestling with Death, without being able to speak one Word; and being taken up he died, leaving his Wife and Children in such a Condition, that by reason of Debts, they fell into Poverty.</P>
<P>About this Time a certain <HI>Popish</HI> Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Popish Au∣thor answered by <HI>J. Coale.</HI></NOTE> who express'd his Name no further than with the Letters <HI>A.

S.</HI> chiefly struck at the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as the worst of Hereticks, falsly perverting their Doctrine, as importing, <HI>That the same Spirit that reproved</HI> Judas <HI>of Sin, did also induce him to Desperation, and to hang himself;</HI> yet he omitted not to encounter the Doctrine of other Protestant Societies; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Church he stated as the true Church, from which they were unjustly departed, and to which they must all return again: <Q><HI>For the Roman,</HI> said he, <HI>was the true Church, and not any other; she was the holy Catholick and Apostolical Church, that was infallible, and could not err; and had the Power to work Miracles.</HI> He also asserted, <HI>that she was one in Matters of Faith, that she was governed by one invisible Head, Christ, and by a visible Head, the Pope; and that therefore she was the true Church.</HI></Q> Now forasmuch as he held forth at large these and several other Positions, so <HI>Josiah Coale</HI> did not omit to answer all these Pretences distinctly and em∣phatically; for he was an undaunted and zealous Disputant. Besides, the Superstition, Idolatry, and cruel Persecution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church which had taken away the Lives of many thousands of honest and pi∣ous People, supplied abundant Matter to <HI>Josiah Coale,</HI> to shew the Pa∣pal Errors, and clearly to prove her to be the false Church. For tho' he did not deny that the true Church was Catholick, or universal, yet he denied <HI>that the Ʋniversality of the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>was a sufficient Ar∣gument to prove her to be the true Church. What Church</HI> (thus he queried) <HI>is more universal than the great Whore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xvii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>and</HI> 15.</NOTE> <HI>the false Church, who had a Name writ∣ten,</HI> Mystery Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abomi∣nations of the Earth?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xiii. 3.

Mark, how universal was this great Whore, the false Church; and how confident she was: For she said in her Heart that she should see no Sorrow; and she glorified her self, and reigned over the Kings of the Earth. Is not this the very State of the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>at this Day? Doth she not reign over the Kings of the Earth?

<HI>the Histories of many Generations past testify this? And was she not to have Blood given her to drink?</HI> as may appear not obscurely from <HI>Rev.</HI> xvii. 6. At this Rate <HI>Josiah Coale</HI> encountred the masked <HI>A. S.</HI> but in a more co∣pious Way; and thus he answered his Assertions. To that, <HI>That the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>should always remain to the End of the World; and that therefore she was infallible; J. Coale</HI> said, that <HI>the bare Affirmation of A.S. was no Proof, except he would produce that Saying of the Mother of Harlets,</HI> I sit as a Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xviii. 7.</NOTE> and am no Widow, and shall see no Sorrow. <HI>But indeed that would be a very pitiful Argument to prove the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>in∣fallible, unless she was first proved to be the true Church.</HI> And as <HI>J. Coale</HI> answered these and other Objections at large, so he shewed also the Vanity of the Boast of Miracles, of which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> gloried, and he refuted all the Falsities which that Anonymous Author had belched out against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as a People that might be wrong'd without incurring any Danger. But I omit to recite all <HI>J. Coale</HI>'s Answers for Brevity-sake; yet may make Mention of a Poem which he writ some Time before, when he was Prisoner at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> to which the Reader is referred, being to be found in <HI>Josiah Coale</HI>'s Works, at <HI>Pag.</HI> III.</P>
<P>Thus zealously <HI>J. Coale</HI> writ against Popery; and yet such hath been the Malice of many, that they represented the <HI>Quakers</HI> as Favourers of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' on many Occasions they had effectually shewn the contrary. But their Enemies endeavoured to brand them many Ways, and they left no Stone unturned to blacken them; to which sometimes false Brethren gave Occasion: For about this Time there were yet many of the Adherents of <HI>John Perrot,</HI> who often ill treated, and spoke evil of those who did not approve their Absurdities.

<P>This he spoke but a short Time before his Departure; and exhorted his Friends to Faithfulness and Stedfastness and that nothing might be suffered to creep in of another Nature than the Truth they professed, to intermix therewith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix. 19.</NOTE> saying, <HI>No Linsey-woolsy Garment must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Some more consolatory Words he spoke, and his last Testimony was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Seal unto all the former Testimonies he had given for the Lord.

<P>As several eminent Men among those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were taken away by Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descent Education, &amp; Character of <HI>R.

But tho' in that tender Age he seemed a little to hearken to them, yet growing up in Years, and so advancing in Knowledge, he soon got a clear Sight of their Errors. During his Stay in <HI>France,</HI> he not only became Master of the <HI>French,</HI> but also of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue. And after he had been instructed in the Languages of the Learned, and other Parts of humane Literature, he returned to <HI>Scotland;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whose Father embraces the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> but during his Absence, his Father had received the Do∣ctrine of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and shewed by his pious Behaviour, that he had not therein acted inconsiderately. <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> having attained the Age of Nineteen Years, and being come to a good Maturity of Under∣standing, found so much Satisfaction in the Religion which his Fa∣ther made Profession of, that he also embraced it, and openly shewed before all the World that the despised Name of <HI>Quakers</HI> could not hinder him from maintaining boldly that which now he apprehended to be Truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And so d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th he about the Age of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9▪ and becomes a Publisher thereof.</NOTE> Nay he grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o zealous and valiant in the Doctrine he now professed, that he became a publick Promulgator of it; and often engaged in Disputes with the Schollars, not only verbally but also by writing; for he was so skilful in School-Learning, that he was able to encounter the Learned with their own Weapons, and of such quick Apprehension as not to be inferior to the refined Wits; his Meekness also was eminent; and these Qualifications were accompanied with so taking a Carriage as rendered him very acceptable to others. And tho' his natural Abilities were great enough to have made him surpass others in human Learning, and so to have beco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e famous among Men, yet he so little valued that Knowledge, that he in no wise en∣deavoured to be distinguished on that Account. But his chief Aim was to advance in real Godliness, as the Conversation I had with him hath undoubtedly assured me: For I was well acquainted with him.</P>
<P>As also with <HI>Roger Haydock</HI> of <HI>Lancashire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J.

And he being a Man of great Parts, well read, and full of Matter, many Times engaged in Disputes with the Priests, sometimes making Use of his Pen also to that End; for he was an unwearied Labourer, and suffered the spoiling of his Goods, and several Imprisonments; and tho' he was attended with bodily Weaknesses, yet he did not use to spare himself, but travelled much to visit the Churches of <HI>England,<PB N="456" REF="003104_0467_0FEFF7C4A1EEAD10"/>

<P>I must now make some Mention again of <HI>Miles Halhead,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Return to <HI>M.

Neither was Perse∣cution now generally so hot in <HI>England,</HI> as it had been before, yet the Presbyterians and some others durst not keep publick Meetings, lest they should be fined;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Artifice of <HI>Presbyte∣rians,</HI> and some others, to escape Per∣secution.</NOTE> but at Times when they have met for Worship, they have had Tobacco-Pipes, Bread and Cheese, and cold Meat on the Table, having agreed before-hand, that if the Officers came in upon them, they should leave their Preaching and Praying, and fall to their Meat.

<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> travelled this Year thro' <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He travels thro' <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> and visited his Friends in their Meetings. But I pass by his Occurrences.</P>
<P>This Year also came forth the <HI>Perpetual Edict,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The perpetual Edict publish∣ed in <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> so called, in <HI>Holland,</HI> made as the Title recites, <HI>For the Maintenance of Liberty, and for Preser∣vation of the Ʋnity, and the common Quiet of the Country of</HI> Holland <HI>and</HI> West-Friesland.

This was on Purpose to prevent the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s be∣coming too potent: For hereupon followed the Suppression of the Stadholdership. But how strong soever this Law was made and con∣firmed by Oaths, yet afterwards it was broke by the Instigation of the Rabble, as will be seen in its due Time.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS. The NINTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Beginning of the Year 1668, <HI>William Penn,</HI> Son of Admiral Sir <HI>William Penn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Account of <HI>W.

But when it came to be known that he was the Son of Admiral <HI>Penn,</HI> he was soon released. Yet this Change did not a little grieve his Father, who intended to have trained him up for the Court; but now saw his eldest Son in the early Part (being about the 22d Year) of his Age, enter'd into the Society of the despised <HI>Quakers.</HI> Several Means were used, nay even his Necessaries were with-held from him, to draw him off, if possible, and bring him to other Resolutions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Much conver∣sant with <HI>J.

<P>This Summer <HI>Stephen Crisp</HI> was Prisoner at <HI>Ipswich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S.

I with some other Friends of <HI>Holland</HI> visited him there in Prison, and we found him in a chearful Condition, as well contented as if he had been at Liberty: For he suffered for the Ministry of the Gospel; and continued to preach in Prison, when his Friends came to visit him.</P>

True it is, the <HI>Baptists</HI> in those Days made some Profession of the Unlawfulness of Swearing; but when they came to be tried on that Account, they soon desisted from that Part of their Profession, as will be shewn more at large in the Sequel. But they and the <HI>Independents,</HI> &amp;c. were very loth to take the Oath of Allegiance, because of a Grudge they had to the Go∣vernment; and this was well known to those that were at the Helm. But the innocent <HI>Quakers</HI> were continually exposed to the Malice of their Persecutors, and bore the hardest Shock of the Laws made against Dissenters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice <HI>Marsh</HI>'s ex∣traordinary Kindness and Service to Friends.</NOTE> But now Justice <HI>Marsh</HI> did not omit to free the <HI>Quakers</HI> from Persecution as much as was in his Power: For he kept several from being premunired in those Parts where he was a Justice. And when sometimes he could not avoid sending those that were brought be∣fore him to Prison, he sent some only for a few Hours, or for a Night. And even this was such hard Work to him, that at length he told the King, <HI>He had sent some of the</HI> Quakers <HI>to Prison co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trary to his Conscience, and that he could not do so any more.</HI> He also advised the King to give Liberty of Conscience; and he was so serviceable to stop the Violence of Persecution, that about this Time, little was heard about disturbing of Meetings.</P>
<P>About the Forepart of this Year, (if I mistake not) there happen'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Case at or nigh <HI>Ipswich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A very re∣markable pas∣sage of a young Woman who murder'd her bastard Child, &amp; being after∣wards convin∣ced in Prison by <HI>J.

Whilst she was in Jail, <HI>John Crook</HI> came to her, and entering into Discourse, he asked her, <HI>Whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring the Course of her Life she had not many times transgressed against her Conscience? And whether she had not often thereupon felt secret Checks and in∣ward Reproofs, and been troubled in her Mind because of the Evil committed?</HI> And this he did in such a convincing Way, that she not only assented to what he said before her, but his Discourse so reach'd her Heart, that she came clearly to see, that if she had not been so stubborn and disobedient to those inward Reproofs, in all Probability she would not have come to such a miserable Fall as now she had: For Man not de∣siring the Knowledge of God's Ways, and depa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting from him, is left helpless, and can't keep himself from Evil, tho' it may be such as formerly he would have abhorred in the highest Degree, and have said with <HI>Hazael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings viii. 13.</NOTE> <HI>What! Is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do this great Thing? J. Crook</HI> thus opening Matters to her, did by his wholsome Ad∣monition so work upon her Mind, that she who never had convers'd with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and was altogether ignorant of their Doctrine, now came to apprehend that it was the Grace of God that brings Salvati∣on, which she so often had withstood; and that this Grace had not yet quite forsaken her, but now made her sensible of the Greatness of her Transgression. This Consideration wrought so powerfully, that from a most grievous Sinner now she became a true Penitent, and with hearty Sorrow she cry'd to the Lord, that it might please him not to hide his Countenance. And continuing in this State of Humiliation, and sincere Repentance, and persevering in Supplication, she felt in Time some Ease; and giving heed to the Exhortations of <HI>J. Crook,</HI> she attained at length to a sure Hope of Forgiveness by the precious Blood of the immaculate Lamb, who died for the Sins of the World. Of this she gave manifest Proofs at her Trial before judge <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> who having heard how penitent she was, would fain have spared her, having on purpose cau∣sed to be inserted in the Indictment, that she had committed the Fact
<PB N="460" REF="003104_0471_0FEFF7C9FAA6CD10"/>
wilfully and designedly. But she being asked according to the Form, <HI>Guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not Guilty?</HI> readily answered, <HI>Guilty.</HI> This astonished the Judge, who purposely had got the Words <HI>wilfully and designedly</HI> inserted in the Indictment, that from hence she might find Occasion to deny the Charge, and so to quash the Indictment; and therefore he told her, <HI>That she seemed not duly to consider what she said; since it could not well be believed that such a one as she, who it may be inconsiderately had roughly handled her Child, should have kill'd it wilfully and designedly.</HI> Here the Judge opened a Back-door for her to avoid the Penalty of Death. But now the Fear of God had got so much Room in her Heart, that no tampering would do; no Fig-leaves could serve her for a Cover; for she knew now that this would have been adding Sin to Sin, and to cover her∣self with a Covering, but not of God's Spirit; and therefore she plain∣ly signified to the Court, <HI>That indeed she had committed the mischievous Fact intendedly, thereby to hide her Shame; and that she having sinned thus grievously, and being affected now with true Repentance, she could by no means excuse her self, but was willing to undergo the Punishment the Law required; and therefore she could not but acknowledge her self guilty, since otherwise how could she expect Forgiveness from the Lord?</HI> This undisguised and free Confession being spoken with a serious Countenance, did so affect the Judge, that Tears trickling down his Face, he sorrowfully said, <HI>Woman, such a Case as this I never met with before; perhaps you, who are but young, and speak so piously, as being struck to the Heart with Repentance, might yet do much Good in the World; but now you force me, that</HI> ex officio <HI>I must pronounce Sentence of Death against you, since you will admit of no Excuse.</HI> Stand∣ing to what she had said, the Judge pronounced Sentence of Death. And when afterward she came to the Place of Execution, she made a patheti∣cal Speech to the People, exhorting the Spectators, especially those that were young, <Q>To have the Fear of God before their Eyes, to give heed to his secret Reproofs for Evil, and so not to grieve and resist the good Spirit of the Lord; which she her self not having timely mind∣ed, it had made her run on in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and thus going on from Wicked∣ness to Wickedness, it had brought her to this dismal Exit. But since she firmly trusted to God's infinite Mercy, nay surely believed her Sins, tho' of a bloody Dye, to be washed off by the pure Blood of Christ, she could contentedly depart this Life.</Q> Thus she preached at the Gallows the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called, and gave Heart-melting Proofs, that her immortal Soul was to enter into Paradice, as well as anciently that of the Thief on the Cross. I have been credibly informed by a Person who had it from the Mouths of such as were present at the Execution, that in her Request to God she prayed, that it might please him to give a visible Sign, that she was received into his Favour. And that tho' it was then a cloudy Day, yet immediately after she was turned off, the Clouds broke a little, and the Sun for a few Moments shined upon her Face, and presently after ceased shining, and the Sky continued overcast. She thus in a serious Frame of Mind suffered Death, which her Crime justly deserved.</P>

<P>Now since Persecution was at a Stand this Year at <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Persecution ceasin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other Dissenters in∣veigh against the <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> those of other Persuasions sometimes bitterly inveighed from the Pulpit against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and would challenge them also to a Dispute. <HI>William Bur∣net</HI> and <HI>Jeremy Ives,</HI> eminent <HI>Baptist</HI> Teachers, had encounter'd <HI>George Whitehead</HI> this Summer at <HI>Chertsey</HI> and <HI>Horn</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> about the Resur∣rection, and Christ's Body in Heaven, endeavouring to blacken the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> in respect of those Points,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.

<P>One <HI>Thomas Vincent,</HI> a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Teacher, was much disturbed be∣cause some of his Auditory were gone over to the Society of the <HI>Qua∣kers;</HI> and to render them odious, he and his Fellow-Teachers accused them of erroneous Doctrine concerning the Trinity;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Vincent</HI> angry at losing some of his Hearers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harges the <HI>Quakers</HI> with false Doctrine about the Tri∣nity, and thereupon a Dispute en∣sued.</NOTE> and this was chiefly because they did not approve of such Expressions as were not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in the Holy Scriptures, as that of <HI>Three Persons.</HI> On this Subject a Dispute was held in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meeting-house at <HI>London,</HI> between the said <HI>Vincent</HI> on one Side, and <HI>George Whitehead</HI> on the other. That which <HI>Vin∣cent</HI> and his Brethren advanced first, was an Accusation, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>held damnable Doctrine. George Whitehead</HI> denying this, would have given the People an Information of the Principles of his Friends; but <HI>Vincent</HI> instead thereof, stated this Question, <HI>Do you own one Godhead, subsisting in three distinct and separate Persons? Whitehead</HI> and those with him denying this as an unscriptural Doctrine, <HI>Vincent</HI> framed this Syllogism.</P>
<P><HI>There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one.</HI></P>
<P><HI>These are either three Manifestations, three Operations, three Substances, or three Somethings else besides Subsistences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But they are not three Manifestations, three Operations, three Substances, nor three any things else besides Subsistences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo, Three Subsistences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. Whitehead</HI> rejected these Terms, <HI>as not to be found in Scripture, nor deduceable from</HI> I John v. 7. the Place <HI>Vincent</HI> instanced. And there∣fore he desired an Explanation of those Terms, <HI>insomuch as God did not use to wrap up his Truths in heathenish Metaphysicks, but in plain Language.</HI> But whatever was said, no better Explanation could be obtained than <HI>Person,</HI> or <HI>the Mode of a Substance. G. Whitehead</HI> and <HI>William Penn,</HI> who also was there, alledged several Places from Scripture, proving God's compleat Unity: And they queried <HI>How God was to be understood, if in an abstracted Sense from his Substance?</HI> But instead of answering the Que∣stion, they concluded it a Point more fit for Admiration than Disputa∣tion. Then <HI>W. Penn</HI> denied the <HI>Minor</HI> Proposition of <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Syllogism; for said he, <HI>No one Substance can have three distinct Subsistences, and preserve its own Ʋnity: For every Subsistence will have its own Substance; so that three distinct Subsistences, or Manners of Beings will require three distinct Substances
<PB N="462" REF="003104_0473_0FEFF78610C57CD0"/>
or Beings; consequently three Gods: For if the infinite Godhead subsists in three separate Manners or Forms, then is not any one of them a perfect and compleat Subsistence without the other two: So Parts, and something finite it in God; or if infinite, then three distinct infinite Subsistences; and what is this, but to assert three Gods, since none is infinite but God? On the contrary, there being an Inseparability betwixt the Substance and its Subsistence, the Ʋnity of Substance will not admit a Trinity of incommunicable or distinct Subsistences.</HI> After seve∣ral Words on both Sides, <HI>G. Whitehead,</HI> to bring this strange Doctrine nearer to the Capacity of the People, comparing their three Persons to three Apostles, said, <HI>He did not understand, how</HI> Paul, Peter, <HI>and</HI> John <HI>could be three Persons and one Apostle.</HI> At which one <HI>Maddocks,</HI> one of <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Assistants, framed this odd Syllogism, <HI>He that scornfully and reproachfully compares our Doctrine of the blessed Trinity of Father, Son, and Spirit, one in Essence, but three in Persons, to three finite Men, as</HI> Paul, Peter, <HI>and</HI> John, <HI>is a Blasphemer. But you</HI> G. Whitehead <HI>have done so.</HI> Ergo. A rash Conclusion; but how firm, let the judicious Reader determine. I have no Mind to enter farther into this Quarrel, since the Parties on both Sides went away unsatisfied: For <HI>Vincent</HI> had not been able to prove <HI>the Doctrines of the</HI> Quakers <HI>damnable,</HI> as he had asserted. But his Passion had transported him, as well as when he said from the Pulpit to those of his Society, <HI>That he had as lief they should go to a Bawdy-house, as to frequent the</HI> Quakers <HI>Meetings, because of their erroneous and damnable Doctrines.</HI> And pointing to the Window, he farther said, <HI>If there should stand a Cup of Poyson, I would rather drink it, than suck in their damnable Doctrines.</HI> But this untimely Zeal did not profit him; for it gave Occasion to some of his Hearers to enquire into the Doctrines of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and thus some came to be convinced of the Truth thereof.</P>
<P>Now since the foresaid Dispute made a great Noise at <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">On this Occa∣sion <HI>W. Penn</HI> publishes a Book called the Sandy-Foundation shaken.</NOTE> <HI>William Penn</HI> published a Book with this Title, <HI>The Sandy Foundation shaken,</HI> in which he explained the Points controverted, and defended his Posit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tions with good Reason and the Holy Scripture. But yet this Book, which he himself spread, caused such a Stir, that it was evil spoken of, and not long after he was committed to the Tower, and some of thought it was not without his Father's being acquainted with it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For which he is sent to the Tower.</NOTE> perhaps to prevent a worse Treatment.</P>
<P>This was at the latter End of the Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Character of <HI>J. Coale,</HI> with some of his dying Words.</NOTE> about which Time <HI>Josiah Coale</HI> fell into a Sickness, which took him off the Stage of this Life: He had languished long, and yet did not at all spare his Voice, but was used both in preaching and praying so to raise it, that he spent his natu∣ral Strength exceedingly, tho' he was yet as in a flourishing Age; nay, it was his Life and Joy to declare the Gospel, and to proclaim the Word of God, for which he had an excellent Ability: And when he spoke to the ungodly World, an awful Gravity appeared in his Counte∣nance, and his Words were like a Hammer and a sharp Sword. But tho' he was as a Son of Thunder, yet his agreeable Speech flow'd from his Mouth like a pleasant Stream, to the Consolation and Comfort of pious Souls. Oh! how pathetically have I heard him pray, when he, as transported and ravished, humbly beseeched God, that it might please him to reach to the hard-hearted, to support the Godly, and to preserve them steadfast: Nay, with what a charming and melodious Voice did he sound forth the PraiseS of the Most High in his publick Prayers! But his Work was now done, he had finished his Course, and a Time of Rest from his Labours was rome. Altho' he grew weak, yet his manly Spi∣rit and great Courage bore him up for some Time; but his Disease, which soem'd to be a kind of Consumption, at length so encreased, that he was fain to keep within Doors for several Weeks; then mending a little, he went abroad again, and came into a Meeting in <HI>London,</HI> where
<PB N="463" REF="003104_0474_0FEFF78950F8DD28"/>
I beheld his Countenance much unlike what it used to be, for it clearly manifested his bodily Indisposition: Nevertheless he preached with a godly Zeal, and his salutary Exhortations flowed like a Stream from his Lips, which seem'd to be touch'd with a Coal from the Altar of Heaven, whilst he was preaching the Gospel, to the Edification of his Heare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Now he began to lift up his Voice again to that Degree, that judging from thence, one would have supposed him to have been pretty well restored: But the Ground of his Distemper not being taken away, he was soon necessitated to keep at home again; and his natural Strength wasted away so fast, and he so declined, that his Death began to be ex∣pected, which not very long after fell out accordingly. A little before he died, <HI>G. Fox</HI> being come to see him, ask'd him, <HI>Whether any thing lay upon him to write to the Friends in</HI> England? But he signified that he had nothing to write, only desired that his Love might be remembred to them, and desired <HI>G. Fox</HI> to pray to God, that he might have an easy Passage, for he felt his End approaching. He having comply'd with his Desire, and seeing him begin to be heavy, bid him go and lie on the Bed; which <HI>J. Coale</HI> did; but finding this, as it seems, more uneasy, with the Help of his Friends he rose again, and sat on the Side of the Bed; and his Friends sitting about him, he felt himself so lively and powerfully raised, that he spoke to them after this manner;</P>
<P><HI>Well Friends, be faithful to God, and a have single Eye to his Glory, and seek nothing for self, or your own Glory, and if any Thing of that arise, judge it down by the Power of the Lord God, that so ye may be clear in his Sight, and answer his witness in all People; then will ye have the Reward of Life. For my Part, I have walked in Faithfulness with the Lord; and I have thus far finished my Tes∣timony, and have Peace with the Lord: His Majesty is with me, and his Crown of Life is upon me. So mind my Love to all Friends.</HI> Then he ceased speaking; and a little Time after he said to <HI>Stephen Crisp, Dear Heart, keep low in the holy Seed of God, and that will be thy Crown for ever.</HI> After a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pause, he said, <HI>A Minister of Christ must walk as he walked.</HI> A little afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Death on the y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of the 11th Month called <HI>Janu∣ary, 1668.9.</HI></NOTE> and being stay'd by his Friends, he departed away in their Arms, without the least Sigh or Groan, but as one falling into a sweet Sleep; and being fill'd with heavenly Consolations, he passed from this mortal Life to that which is immortal, having attain'd the Age of thirty five Years, and two Months, and preach'd the Gospel about twelve Years. He had travelled much in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> sustain'd great Hardships, and laboured in the Ministry at his own Charge, being freely given up to spend his Substance in the Service of the Lord. And tho' he went thro' many Persecutions, Imprisonments, and other Adversities, yet he was always valiant, and not afraid of Danger; and continued in an unmarried State, that so he might the more freely labour in the hea∣venly Harvest, and many were converted by his Ministry. He liv'd to see the Desire of his Heart accomplished: for when first he was raised up to true Godliness, being under the sense of his former Transgression, he cryed to the Lord for Deliverance, and said with <HI>David, If thou,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm xl. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> O God, wilt help throughly, <HI>then will I teach Transgressors thy Ways, and Sinners shall be converted unto thee.</HI> He had been long in a mournful State, tho' naturally of a chearful Temper; and having himself passed thro' a Path of Sorrow, he was the more able to comfort the Mourners of <HI>Zion.</HI> The Church was very sensible of this great Loss: and I have Reason to think his Corps was attended to the Grave by more than a Thousand of his Friends, among whom I was then one; and his Burial be∣ing very publick and well known, drew the Eyes of many Spectators towards it. Let none think it strange that I have here expatiated somewhat largely, seeing he was indeed dear to me, and I have his kind Usage yet in fresh Remembrance; for the Piety of my Mother, whom
<PB N="464" REF="003104_0475_0FEFF7CD8CA76910"/>
he had seen in <HI>England,</HI> caused him to give me Marks of the Esteem he bore to her Memory: And his excellent Endowments so affected me, that I was eager to go to that Meeting where I heard he was likely to be; nay, I imagin'd I saw something in him so extraordinary valuable, that I bore a very reverent Respect to him, and the more because Differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Age deprived me of a familiar Conversation with him.</P>

Truly God will own his People, as he hath ever hitherto done, and as we have daily witnessed; for no sooner had they made that Act of Banish∣ment, to the great Suffering of many good Friends, but the Lord stirred up Ene∣mies against them, whereby the Violence of their Hands was taken off.

<P>He left a good Name behind him amongst all who knew him.—Some Time before his Sickness, considering this mutable State, and finding in himself some decay of Nature, he made his Will, in which, as his Love was very dear to his Brethren, with whom he had labour'd in the Mi∣nistry, so he gave to each of them a Remembrance of his Love; he left also a Legacy to his poor Friends in those Parts were he lived.</P>
<P>For altho' his moveable Goods were forfeited to the King for ever, yet the Confiscation of his real Estate was only for Life; so that from thence having something left, he could dispose of it by his Will.</P>

I was not born to great Possessions, or did inherit great Matters in this World; but the Lord hath always endowed me with Sufficiency and Enough, and hath been as a tender Father unto me, because my Heart trusted in him, and did love the Way of Righteousness from a Child.—My Counsel unto thee is, that thou remember thy Creator in the Days of the Youth, and fear the Lord in thy Youth, and learn to know him and serve him all thy Days: First seek the Kingdom of God and the Righteousness thereof; it's not far from thee; it is with∣in thee; it consists in Life and Power, and it stands in Righteousness, Truth and Equity, Justice, Mercy, Long-suffering, Patience, Love, Light, and Holiness, this is the Being and Center thereof; therefore seek not Lo here, or Lo there without thee, in this or that outward Observation, for many seek there and ne∣ver find it; but seek and thou shalt find, wait and thou shalt receive. If thou en∣quire, In what must I seek, and what must I wait in? And how must I seek? I inform thee, that thou must silence all thy own Thoughts, and thou must turn thy Mind to that which is pure, and holy, and good within thy self, and seek and wait in that in the Light of Jesus Christ, wherewith thou art enlightned, which shews thee when thou dost Evil, and checks and reproves; take Heed unto that, and it will shew the evil Motions and Thoughts; and as thou lovest it, it will subdue them, and preserve thee for the time to come out of Evil: For tho' thou be born into the World a reasonable Creature, yet thou must be born again, and be made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Creature, or else thou canst not enter into God's Kingdom; thou must know the Seed of the Kingdom in thy self, of which thou must be born and formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into God's Image. I have told thee God hath sown it in thee, a Grain of it, a Measure of it, a Portion of if, a Measure of Light and Truth, of Righ∣teousness and Holiness; keep in thy Mind to that, and love it, and thou wilt feel the heavenly Father working in thee, and begetting thee to Life thro' Jesus Christ that hath enlightned thee, and thou wilt feel the Power of the Lord strength∣ning thee in thy Little, and making thee to grow in the immortal Seed of his Kingdom, and outgrow and overgrow all Evil, so that thou wilt daily die to that, and have no Pleasure in it, but in the Lord, and in his Goodness and Vir∣tue shed abroad in thy Heart, which thou wilt taste and feel within, and have Joy and Comfort therein: Love the Lord with thy Heart and Soul, even him that made thee, and gave thee a Being, and all Things in Heaven and Earth; and still wait for the Knowledge of him in thy self, he is not far from thee, but near unto thee, and unto all that call upon him in an upright Heart; and do thou enquire of thy dear Mother, she will inform thee, she knows him and the Way to Life and Peace, and hearken to her Instructions: God is a Spirit, of Light, and Life, and Power: He that searcheth the Heart, and shews thee when thou dost, or thinkest, or speakest Evil, and shews unto Man and Woman their Thoughts: That which shews the Evil is good, and that which shews a Lie is Truth; this is within, take Heed to it; this is called God's Spirit in the Scrip∣ture;
<PB N="466" REF="003104_0477_0FEFF7D01003EA20"/>believe in it, love it, and it will quicken thy Heart to Good, and it will subject the Evil: Here is thy Teacher near thee, love it; and if thou act con∣trary, it will condemn thee; therefore take Heed unto this Spirit of Truth, and it will enlighten and enliven thee, and it will open thy Ʋnderstanding, and give thee to know what God is, and to do that which is good and acceptable in his Sight; this Spirit never errs, but leads out of all Error into all Truth. Be sober minded in thy Youth, and wait on the Lord within, hearken unto him. God is Light immortal, Life immortal, Truth immortal, an everlasting eter∣nal Spirit: He speaks spiritually and invisibly within the Hearts and Conscien∣ces of Men and Women; hear what he speaks, and obey his Voice, and thy Soul shall live; fear to offend him, or sin against him, for the Wages of Sin are Death; therefore prize his Love in thy young and tender Years, and do thou read the Scriptures, and Friends Books, and take Heed to what thou readest to obey it, as far as thou understandest, and pray often unto the Lord, that he will give thee his Knowledge, and open thy Ʋnderstanding in the things of his Kingdom; search thy Heart often with the Light of Christ in thee, manifest and bring thy Deeds to it, that they may be tried; and examine thy self, how the Case stands betwixt the Lord and thee; and if thou seest thy self wrong, humble thy self, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sorry, and turn unto him, and he will shew thee Mercy, and take Heed for the Time to come, that thou run not into the same Evil again; keep thy Heart clean, watch against the Evil in thy self, in that which shews it; therein there is Pow∣er, and thereby thou hast Power to overcome all Evil. And, dear Child, mind not the Pleasures of Sin, which are but for a Moment, and the End is Misery; but keep under and cross thy Will and Affection, so thy Mind will have no Plea∣sure in the Evil but in Good, and thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feel the immortal Seed springing up in thee, which God's Peace and Love is to. Oh Child, these are great and weighty Things, not to be slighted. Accompany thy self always with them that fear the Lord, and fear and worship him in Spirit and Truth, and lead a holy and blameless Life and Conversation; deny them not, but love them, and suffer with them. Take heed that thou follow not the Hireling Teachers, who preach for Gain and Lucre, and abide not in Christ's Doctrine; believe them not, heed them not, they do People no Good; but thou wilt see them thy self, they have an Outside Shew of Godliness sometimes, but deny the Power of God and true Ho∣liness; remember I have told thee, who have had perfect Knowledge of them. But be sure that thou let nothing separate thy Love from God and his Peo∣ple; those are his People that keep his Law, and obey Christ's Voice, and lead a holy Life, and they were ever hated, and belied, and persecuted, and evi1-spo∣ken on always by had and evil loose People; these are God's People, and his Love, and Peace, and Blessing is with them; do thou grow as a natural Branch (up among them) of the living Vine, and continue all thy Days in Obedience unto God's Will, and thou wilt feel Joy and Love in thy Heart, which above all things covet after, and thou shalt attain and obtain everlasting Peace, which the Lord grant unto thee, according to the Riches of his Mercy and Love, which en∣dure for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And now <HI>Abigail,</HI> concerning thy well-being in this Life, this is my Advice and Counsel unto thee: Love thy dear Mother, and ever obey her and honour her, and see thou grieve her not; be not stubborn nor wilful, but submit unto her, and be as an obedient Child unto her, whose Love and Care hath been too great ever thee and thy Sisters, which hath brought too much Trouble upon her self; learn in thy Youth to read and write, and sew, and knit, and all Points of good Labour that belong to a Maid; and flee Idleness and Sloth, that nourisheth Sin; and as thou growest up in Years, labour in the Affairs of the Country, and beware of Pride, and Riotousness, and Curiosity, but he well content with such Apparel as thy Mother will permit thee, and as thou may'st be a good Example unto others. Be not wanton, nor wild, nor light, but temperate, moderate, and chaste, and not forward in Words nor Speech, but swift to hear, slow to speak; and do thou always live with thy Mother, and be a Help unto her, and cherish her in her old
<PB N="467" REF="003104_0478_0FEFF78D50055568"/>
Age and latter Years, that she may be comforted in thee, and her Soul may bless thee. Love thy Sisters, and be always courteous to them and thy Brother, encou∣rage one another in Good: And if thou live to be a Woman of perfect Years, keep thy self unspotted, and let not thy Mind out after Sports n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pastimes, the End <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all those is Sorrow, neither of young Men; if thou have a Desire to marry, do not thou seek a Husband, but let a Husband seek thee▪ and if thou live in God's Fear, and an honest Life and virtuous, them that fear God will seek unto thee; let not thy Affections out unto every one that profers Love, but be considerate, and above all things chuse one (if thou dost marry) that loves and fears the Lord, whose Conversation thou knowest, and Manner and Course of Life well before thou give Consent▪ be discreet and wise, hide nothing from thy Mother, and she will advise thee, no Doubt, for thy Good; and if she be living, marry not without her Consent; and if thou join to a Husband, be sure thou love him in thy Heart, and be obedient unto him, and honour him among all, so will his Heart be more to thee, and his Love encrease; grieve him not, but be gentle, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asy to be entreated, and mind thy own Business; and if the Lord give thee Children, bring them up in God's Fear, and good Exercise, and keep them in Subjection unto thee, and be an Example of Vertue and Holiness unto them, that the Lord's Blessing thou may'st feel in Youth and in Age, and all thy Life long. O <HI>Abigail,</HI> re∣member these things, keep in Mind these Things, read often this Writing over, get it copied over, and lay up my Words in thy Heart, and do them, so wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou be happy in this Life, and in the Life to come; these things I give thee in Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge to observe, as my <HI>Mind,</HI> and <HI>Will,</HI> and <HI>Counsel</HI> unalterable unto thee, as Witness hereof I have set my Hand,</P>

<P>In the Beginning of this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Yearly Meeting at <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> the Members of this Society held a General Yearly Meeting at <HI>London,</HI> which since that Time hath been used to be held there annually in the Week called <HI>Whitson-Week,</HI> because at that Time of the Year it is commonly best travelling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Several are deputed from all Places to this Meeting, and what concerns the Church in general is there treated on.</P>
<P>Persecution for Religion seem'd now to be at a Stand, which dis∣pleased some of the most rigid Sort of Churchmen, which we not only have already, but may again in due Place demonstrate.</P>
<P>About this Time (as I take it) a certain Bishop said occasionally, <Q>That the <HI>Quakers,</HI> by their unlimited Freedom, increas'd much, and therefore it was very needful to take Care of them, seeing they often had much greater Assemblies than the national Church; for, said he, at such a Time <HI>I preach'd my self, and there were but a few Hearers, when at the same Time the</HI> Quakers <HI>Meeting just by was crouded full;</HI> and there∣upon he desired them to consider whether it was not high Time to stop these Sectaries.</Q> After he had set forth his Matter at large, another Lord then present among others, said, <Q>That indeed it seemed that the Lord Bishop had spoken what was very reasonable, that the Sectaries had often more Hearers than the national Church-Preach∣ers, and that it was not strange to him that it displeased him, since he took so much upon himself; for, said he, his Lordship observ'd, That <HI>he preach'd</HI> himself;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A witty Turn upon a Bishop,</NOTE> <HI>and the professed</HI> Quakers, <HI>who had such great Assem∣blies, preach'd</HI> Christ Jesus, <HI>and therefore are no Wonder they had the more Hear∣ers.</HI></Q>— This was such a witty Turn upon the Bishop, as no Doubt made him so sensible as not to think fit to enter upon the Debate in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doubtful Dispute; for it's observable, this Lord's Turn upon the Bi∣shop was chiefly to stop him from promoting Persecution.</P>

Briggs,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> went thro' several other Places in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and altho' he came near to his old Enemy, Col. <HI>Kirby,</HI> who had a Fit of the Gout, and had threatned him, yet he passed on unmolested. So he went to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> whence he, with some of his Friends, passed over for <HI>Ireland:</HI> Among others were <HI>Thomas Briggs</HI> and <HI>John Stubbs;</HI> and being arrived at <HI>Dublin,</HI> he was kindly re∣ceived by his Friends; and journeying into the Country, he met with no small Opposition from the <HI>Papists,</HI> (of whom there are many there.) Being come to a certain Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where he is opposed by the <HI>Papists,</HI> and challengeth the Jesuits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to prove their Wafer God.</NOTE> he challenged the Jesuits, Priests and Monks to try whether their God which they make of a Wafer be an immortal God, but they could not be brought to it; wherefore he said they were worse than <HI>Baal</HI>'s Priests, for <HI>Baal</HI>'s Priests tried their God. Then he went to <HI>Cork,</HI> where they had Knowledge of his coming, and intended to take him Prisoner; for the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> were many Years sharply persecuted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Then he goes to <HI>Cork.</HI></NOTE> as their Brethren were in <HI>England,</HI> of which to mention all Circumstances, it would make a very large Treatise. At this Time there were many Prisoners at <HI>Cork,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Where <HI>Sam. Thornton,</HI> and near 80 more are se∣verely treated by the Mayor <HI>M. Dean.</HI></NOTE> among whom was <HI>Samuel Thornton,</HI> with whom I was well acquainted, who being met with his Friends in a Chamber, one First-day, the Officer <HI>Quinnal</HI> came and shut the Door of the Room, and locked them in, to the Number of eighty Persons, and carried the Key to the Mayor <HI>Matthew Dean,</HI> who gave Order that there should neither Victuals nor Drink be carried to them, and they could only get what was pull'd up with Ropes thro' the Grate, or thrown in thro' a Hole: Under this Chamber the Soldiers were order'd to keep Guard, that none might get away, and they made so great a Smoak, that many of the Prisoners were sick, among whom were some weakly old People, and some Women with Child, and Nurses, who were al∣most stifled; and Complaint thereof being made to the Mayor, he an∣swered in a scoffing Manner, <HI>They are all Brethren and Sisters, let them lie upon one another; and if they are stifled 'tis their own Fault.</HI> Thus they were kept 24 Hours, and afterwards some of them made Prisoners.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon Eccles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Relation of some bold and zealous At∣tempts of <HI>S. Eccles.</HI></NOTE> whom I also knew very well, was this Year in Prison at <HI>Galloway</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he was put by a strange Accident. He was an extraordinary zealous Man, and what he judg'd Evil he warmly op∣posed, even to the Hazard of his Life. This Zeal led him to perform a strange Action in a Chappel of the <HI>Papists</HI> without the Town; for he went naked above his Waste, with a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdish of Coals and burning Brimstone on his Head, and entered the Chappel when all the People were on their Knees to pray to their Idol, and spoke as followeth, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to these idolatrous Worshippers! God hath sent me this Day to warn you, and to shew you what will be your Portion except you repent:</HI> Which when he had done, he went away to the Town, where he was presently made a Prisoner. What the Benefit of this strange Action might be, I leave.</P>
<P>Amongst the Martyrs of the Reformed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Gardiner <HI>of</HI> Lisbon <HI>Martyr.</HI></NOTE> we find some instances of Per∣sons zealous to a strange Degree, as of <HI>William Gardiner</HI> at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and <HI>Bertrand le Blas</HI> at <HI>Tournay,</HI> whose Actions were not less remarkable; for this last's snatching the Host from the Priest in their Church as they were at Mass,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bold At∣tempt of <HI>Ber∣trand le Blas</HI> of <HI>Tournay.</HI></NOTE> was certainly a bold Attempt, and not Praise-wor∣thy, if it was only an Act of human Contrivance; but I shall leave the Judgment thereof unto God, as I account it safest, and the rather, be∣cause under the sharpest Punishment they could inflict, they seemed not to shrink, but rather to be strongthened. However so sharp a Trial did not fall to <HI>Eccles</HI>'s Portion, and I think it safer not to judge hastily of this uncommon Performance. He was, to my Knowledge, a bold and un∣daunted Man; and before this Action in the Chappel, as above, he did something of a like Nature at <HI>London</HI> at the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-time, amongst the Plays; where he suffered much by the Coachmens whipping him grie∣vously

on his naked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack; but that could not allay his fervent Zeal, which was kindled, not only against the immodest and ungo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Car∣riage of the pretended Fools, but also against those other Vanities there used. To what Height his Zeal carried him, the following Instance will shew: He who had been a <HI>Member</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and then went to the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and afterwards among the <HI>Independents,</HI> and after that was a <HI>Baptist,</HI> had been an eminent Musician, so that by his Art he could get near 150 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. a Year; but at last being a <HI>Quaker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> he could not follow for Conscience-sake what he now called his <HI>Babylonish</HI> Trade of Musick; wherefore he learned to make Clothes to get his Living by, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old his musical Books and Instruments: But (as he declared) he had no Peace in his Conscience; for observing them to be Instruments of Vanity, he judged they ought to be destroyed, and therefore bought them again, altho' they were worth above 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and carried them, <HI>viz</HI> Virginals, Fid∣dles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> where laying them together, he set Fire to them, but when some who were by, endeavour'd to hinder him, and to get one of the Virginals away, he stampt upon it with his Foot, and would not rest until he had destroyed it; and after that he said he found Peace in his Conscience, having made an Offering of that which he once entirely loved, and in the Use of which he was educated; for not only his Fa∣ther and Grandfather, but his Grandfather's Father had been Musici∣ans, and he himself had the Name of an eminent Musick-Master.</P>
<P>Another Account we have of his strange Zeal: When he saw how the <HI>Quakers</HI> were bely'd by <HI>William Burnet, Jeremy Ives,</HI> and <HI>Mathew Kaffin,</HI> Teacher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amongst the <HI>Baptists,</HI> as if they believed not in Christ, nor the Resurrection, he challenged all the Teachers, and Priests, and Jesuits openly in a Book which he printed, to come to a Proof with him who were the true Worshipers; first, to fast seven Days and seven Nights, and neither to eat nor drink; and then the Next seven Days not to sleep Day nor Night; but we may well think that none were to be found to enter the Lists with him, nor to put themselves on such a Test; and altho' some reckon'd him out of his Wits, yet he was not; for I remember the Time very well, and had many an Opportunity both to see and to hear him speak.</P>
<P>I now return to <HI>G. F.</HI> at <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

F.</HI> and yet let him pass quietly. After he had travelled thro' many Places in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he came again to <HI>Dublin,</HI> from whence he retur∣ned to <HI>England,</HI> and coming into <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> he heard at <HI>Nailsworth</HI> of a Report which had been spread abroad in the Country, that he was tur∣ned <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and that they had prepar'd a Pulpit for him in an open Yard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A diver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Story of <HI>G.

F.</HI> hearing this, thought it very strange, whereupon he went to the Place spoken of, where he indeed found a Pulpit; but the Case was this. A certain <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Preacher, na∣med <HI>John Fox,</HI> who went preaching about the Country, was to preach there, and it seems some had changed his Name from <HI>John</HI> to <HI>George,</HI> whereupon it was reported that he was turned from being a <HI>Quaker</HI> to be a <HI>Presbyterian:</HI> This begat so great a Curiosity in the People, that many went thither to hear this <HI>Quaker</HI> turned <HI>Presbyterian:</HI> so this <HI>John Fox</HI> came to have a great Auditory, (of several Hundreds) who would not have went a Foot to have heard him, had they known it. Now some Hundreds of them hearing afterwards that the real <HI>G. F.</HI> was not far off at a Meeting, they went thither and were sober and attentive; where they were by him directed to the Grace of God in themselves, which would teach them and bring them Salvation. And when the Meeting was over, some of the People said, they liked <HI>G. F.</HI> the <HI>Quaker</HI>'s

Preaching, better than <HI>G. F.</HI> the <HI>Presbyterian.</HI> Not long after this, <HI>John Fox</HI> was complained of in the House of Commons, for having a tumul∣tuous Meeting, in which treasonable Words were spoken. This <HI>John Fox</HI> had formerly been Priest of <HI>Marshfield</HI> in <HI>Glocester-shire</HI> and being put out of that Place, was afterwards permitted by a Common-prayer Priest to preach sometimes in his Steeple-house; at length this <HI>Presby∣terian</HI> Priest, presuming too far upon the Parish-Priest's former Grant, began to be more bold than welcome, and would have preached there whether the Parish-Priest would or not; which caused a great Bustle and Contest between the two Priests, and their Hearers on either Sides, in which the Common-prayer-Book was cut to Pieces, and it is said some treasonable Words were then spoken by some of the Followers of this <HI>John Fox;</HI> which Case was quickly put into the News-papers, and some malicious <HI>Presbyterians</HI> caused it to be so worded as if it had pro∣ceeded from <HI>G. F.</HI> the <HI>Quaker;</HI> but some Members of the House of Commons certified it under their Hands, than it was <HI>John Fox</HI> formerly Priest of <HI>Marshfield,</HI> who was complained of to be the Ringleader of that unlawful Assembly.</P>
<P>After this <HI>G. F.</HI> travelled to <HI>Bristol,</HI> where he met with <HI>Margaret Fell,</HI> then a Widow, who came thither to visit her Daughter <HI>Yeomans.</HI> He had before this, intimated to her his Affection, and proposed taking her in Marriage at a suitable Time; but tho' he had a Sense in himself, it was of the Lord, yet he did not at first find a Freedom to accomplish the same; but all Obstructions being now removed, he so proposed the Matter, that if she was willing to give her Consen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that the same should be accomplished, she might first send for her Children; who being come, he asked both her Daughters and their Husbands, <HI>Whether they had any thing against his taking their Mother to be his Wife?</HI> and they all severally ex∣pressed their Satisfaction therein. Then he asked <HI>Margaret,</HI> Whether <HI>she had performed her Husband's Will?</HI> and the Children, Whether, <HI>if their Mother married, they should lose by it?</HI> The Children said, <HI>She had answer∣ed it to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

<P><HI>G.

But at last thro' as∣siduous Application, they got to the Speech of the King, to whom one of them said, <HI>That instead of their waiting upon him to return him Thanks for the Discharge of their Mother, they were now necessitated to make Complaint of their Mother's being cast into Prison a second Time.</HI> Whereupon the King gave Command to Sir <HI>John O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way,</HI> to write to the Sheriff of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> to set her at Liberty, which Letter <HI>G.

<P>By this very Law many an honest Family was Impoverished; for the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not leave off meeting together publickly, but the most sin∣cere amongst them were the more zealous, and they were the more winnowed from the Chaff, which in Time at Ease gets in amongst re∣ligious Professors; and none need, wonder at it, since the <HI>Quakers</HI> having gained the Repute of an upright hearted People, some for By-ends might creep in amongst them.</P>
<P>At <HI>London</HI> as well as at other Places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Baseness and Cruelty of Informers, and of some Justices.</NOTE> many were spoiled of their Goods very unmercifully, and many times People of good Substance brought to meer Poverty, seeing not only the Shop goods of some, but also their Houshold-goods have been seized, insomuch that the very Sick have had their Beds taken from under them, and they themselves laid upon the Floor; nay they have been so cruel, as to leave them nothing; in∣somuch that when the Child's Pap hath stood in a Pannikin, they have thrown one the Pap to take the Pannikin away.</P>
<P>Should I sum up all the Particulars I have received, and the Account I could give, it would make a Volume of it self; for the Informers were generally poor, and sometimes also the Justices, so that they knew how to part their Booty belonging to the King, as well as to the Poor; and thus the King and the Poor got but little of their Plunder. Nevertheless it so happened sometimes, that those who were fineable, were freed by the Justices;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honest Justices discou∣raged those Practices.</NOTE> for they knew very well, that those Informers, who were al∣so Witnesses, were cunning Sharkers, who were only concerned to get their Thirds of the Booty, and therefore found out a Way by which they shewed that they were knavish and unjust in their Office, there∣fore not fit to give Evidence; so that it hath sometimes fallen out, that an honest Justice hath cleared those informed against, when the In∣former mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in his Evidence, either in the Day of the Month, or the like, in the Complaint.</P>
<P>At <HI>London</HI> there once appeared before the Lord Mayor sitting at a Court Of Aldermen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thro' the Lord Mayor's Discourage∣ment an im∣pudent Infor∣mer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Prison.</NOTE> an impudent Informer, having such a Quantity of Informations for Fines as would have wronged the Parties to the Value of 1500<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> but the Mayor abominating such a Practice, adjourned the Court, and went away. But this hardy Informer was not content to let the Matter fall thus, but appeared before the Court from Time to Time, to make a Booty of honest People's Goods; but they still put him off, until at last he was himself arrested for Debt, and carried to Prison, where he ended his Days.</P>
<P>Altho' now the Law against Seditious Conventicles had passed upon a Supposition that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> were ready to rise, considering the Bustle and Tumult Occasioned by <HI>John Fox</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> which was much taken Notice of, as I have mentioned before, yet nevertheless the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings became the chief Object in the Execution of this Law.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> write<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against the In∣justice of this Law. And an Epi∣stle to encou∣rage his Friends.</NOTE> Whereupon <HI>G. Fox</HI> being in <HI>London,</HI> set forth in Print the Inju∣stice of this Law, in Order, if possible, to moderate the Government not to put the same in Execution. Nevertheless being also sensible that a great Storm hung over the Heads of Friends, he also writ an Epistle to them, to exhort them to Faithfulness, and to encourage them to stand fast in their Testimony, and bear with Christian Patience the Suf∣fering that was come upon them. Now the first First-day that this Law took Place, he went to the Meeting of Friends at <HI>Grace-church-Street,</HI>
<PB N="476" REF="003104_0487_0FEFD56771E10718"/>
in <HI>London;</HI> but being come to the Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> goes to <HI>Grace-Church-street</HI> Meet∣ing-House when this Law first took place, and preaching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oere, is ta∣ken into Cus∣tody with o∣thers.</NOTE> he found the Street full of People, and a Guard to keep them out of their Meeting-house; whereupon he went to <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> (out of which there was also a Passage to the Meeting-house) and there he also found a Guard; but there being a Court before the Door, which was full of People, one of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Ministers was there preaching to the People, and when he had ended, <HI>G. Fox</HI> stood up, and said, Saul, Saul, <HI>why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks.</HI> Which Words he thus ex∣plained; That it was <HI>Saul</HI>'s Nature that persecuted; and that they persecuting Christ in his Members, were k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cking against the Pricks; and that it was the Birth of the Flesh that persecuted the Birth of the Spirit; and that it was the Nature of Dogs to tear and devour the Sheep, but that they suffered like Sheep, who did not bite again; but were a peaceable People, who loved even their Persecutors. While <HI>G. Fox</HI> was thus Preaching, there came a Constable and an Informer, with Sol∣diers, who pull'd him down from the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace he stood on. Then, said he, <HI>Blessed are the Peace-makers;</HI> But the Commander of the Soldiers or∣dered them to secure him: For, said he, you are the Man I look'd for, Wherefore he, with two more of his Friends, <HI>John Burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> and another, were had before the Lord Mayor; and as they were going, the Infor∣mer said, <HI>It will never be a good World, until all People come to the good old Religion that was two hundred Years ago. G. F.</HI> hearing this, said, <HI>Art thou a Papist?<NOTE PLACE="marg">What befel a Popish Infor∣mer against <HI>G. F.</HI></NOTE> What! A Papist Informer? For two hundred Years ago there was no other publick Profession of Religion but that of the Papists in this Nation.</HI> It vexed the Informer, that <HI>G. F.</HI> heard him speak thus; for he now saw he was insnared in his own Talk. When he came into the Court be∣fore the Lord Mayor's House, some People who were there, asked <HI>G. F. Why he was brought thither Prisoner? Pray,</HI> said he, <HI>ask that Informer, and ask him his Name;</HI> but he would not tell his Name. Then one of the Mayor's Officers looking out at a Window, told him, <HI>He should tell his Name before he went away: For,</HI> said he, <HI>the Lord Mayor will know by what Authority you have intruded your self with Soldiers into the Execution of those Laws which it belongs to the Civil Magistrate to execute, and not the Military.</HI> The Informer understanding this, got away, but not without some Dif∣ficulty, because they would not then let him out of the Court; but he forceably pulling open the Door, and being got into the Street, the Peo∣ple gave a great Shout, crying out, <HI>A Papist Informer! A Papist Informer!</HI> And he would have come off but badly, had not <HI>G. F.</HI> advised the Con∣stable and Soldiers to keep him out of the Hands of the Common People. Whereupon he went into a House and changed his Perriwig and so got away.</P>
<P>When the Lord Mayor came home, and <HI>G. F.</HI> was brought before him, he said, <HI>Mr.</HI> Fox, <HI>You are an eminent Man among those of your own Profession, pray will you be instrumental to perswade them from meeting in such great Numbers; For,</HI> said he, <HI>seeing Christ hath promised, when two or three are met in his Name, he will be in the midst of them; and the King and Parliament are graciously pleased to allow of Four to meet together to worship God, why will not you be content to partake both of Christ's Promise to two or three, and the King's Indulgence to Four?</HI> To which <HI>G. F.</HI> answered, <Q>That Christ's Promise was not to discourage many from meeting to∣gether in his Name; but to encourage the Few, that the fewest might not forbear to meet, because of their Fewness. But if Christ hath promised to manifest his Presence in the midst of so small an Assem∣bly, where but Two or Three were gathered in his Name; how much more would his Presence abound where two or three Hundred are gathered in his Name. I wish'd him to consider, Whether this Act would not have taken hold of Christ, with his twelve Apostles and
<PB N="477" REF="003104_0488_0FEFF79C401CB790"/>
70 Disciples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670</NOTE> (if it had been in their Time) who used to meet often to∣gether; and that with great Numbers? However I told him, this Act did not concern us; for it was made against seditious Meetings, of such as met under Pretence and Colour of Religion, to contrive Insur∣rections, as (the Act says) late Experience had shewn; but we had been sufficiently tried and proved, and always found peaceable: And therefore he should do well to put a Difference between the Innocent and the Guilty. He said, <HI>The Act was made against Meetings, and a Worship not according to the Liturgy.</HI> I told him, <HI>[according to]</HI> was not the very same Thing; and I asked him, Whether the Liturgy was according to the Scriptures? And whether we might not read Scrip∣tures, and speak Scriptures? He said, <HI>Yes.</HI> I told him, That this Act took hold only of such <HI>as meet to plot and contrive Insurrections, as late Experience had shewn;</HI> but they had never experienced that by us. Be∣cause Thieves are sometimes on the Road, must not honest Men tra∣vel therefore? And because Plotters and Contrivers have met to do Mischief, must not an honest and peaceable People meet to do Good? If we had been a People that did meet <HI>to plot and contrive Insurrections,</HI> &amp;c. we might have drawn our selves into Pours: For Four might do more Mischief in Plotting, than if there were four Hundred; because Four might speak out their Minds more freely one to another, than four Hundred could. Therefore we being innocent, and not the Peo∣ple this Act concerns, we keep our Meetings as we used to do; and I said, I believed, that he knew in his Conscience, we were innocent.</Q></P>

The Treatment this Infomer met with made others scrupulous, yet several of their Meetings in <HI>London</HI> were disturbed, and some or their Preachers cast into Prison; but tho' the <HI>Baptists</HI> and others Dissenters ceased their publick Meetings, yet the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> continued to keep theirs, as they used to do, whereby it happened that some of their Meeting-houses were pulled down,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ratcliff</HI> Meeting House pull'd down.</NOTE> and amongst others that at <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> which was a substantial Building, almost new.</P>
<P>After some Time the Heat of Persecution in the City began to abate, but in other Places it raged more fiercely; this engaged <HI>G. F.</HI> to leave the City, and travel about the Country in divers Places to visit his Friends.</P>
<P>This Year <HI>G. F.</HI> had a very great Fit of Sickness,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> so ill, that his Life is in great Danger: but he recovers.</NOTE> to such a Degree, that he became both blind and deaf, insomuch that his Recovery was despaired of by some; but after a Time he grew better.</P>
<P>In the mean while Persecution in many Places grew very dismal; for many of the Friends were beaten with Swords, and Pikes, and Muskets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Cruel∣ty.</NOTE> to that Degree, that their Blood ran along the Ground, and the Inform∣ers were so very eager to hunt after their Prey, that they informed of Meetings when there was none. Amongst others this following was an Instance. At <HI>Droitwich, John Cartwright</HI> came to a Friend's House there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Informer at <HI>Droitwich</HI> in Pursuit of his Wicked∣ness falls off his Horse and dies.</NOTE> who sitting down to Supper, he prayed before they eat, which being heard by an Informer, the Room being next to the Street, he thereupon went immediately and informed that there was a Meeting in the House, and so got a Warrant to distrain the Goods; and when he came riding with them in the Evening, he fell from his Horse, and brake his Neck, thereby getting his Death instead of his Prey which he hunted after.</P>
<P>Now altho' Persecution was not so hot in <HI>London,</HI> as in other Places in the Country, yet sometimes even there it was very severe, as may be seen by the Instance of <HI>William Penn</HI> and <HI>William Mead,</HI> who were taken from a Meeting and imprisoned, and tried for the same in the Month of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>The Indictment contained, <HI>That</HI> William Penn <HI>and</HI> William Mead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The famous Trial of <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>W.

<HI>in</HI> London, <HI>the 15th of</HI> August, <HI>with Force and Arms, and tumultnously as∣sembled together, and that</HI> William Penn, <HI>by Agreement between him and</HI> William Mead, <HI>had preached there in the publick Street, whereby was caused a great Concourse and Turnult of People,</HI> &amp;c. That there was a publick Meet∣ing in the Street, proceeded from Necessity; because a Guard was pla∣ced in the Passage to hinder Friends from going into their Meeting-house; but it was a great Untruth that they met with Force and Arms, which was never used by the <HI>Quakers.</HI> This Indictment being read be∣fore the Court, the Prisoners were demanded, according to Custom, whether they were <HI>guilty,</HI> or <HI>Not guilty?</HI> Whereupon <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>It is impossible that we should be able to remember the Indictment</HI> verbatim, <HI>and there∣fore we desire a Copy of it, as is customary on the like Occasions.</HI> The Recorder <HI>John Howel</HI> said hereupon, <HI>You must first plead to the Indictment, before you can have a Copy of it.</HI> Then <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, That he first desired, <HI>That no Advantage might be taken against him, nor he deprived or any Benefit, which he might otherwise receive, and that the Court would promise him a fair Hear∣ing, and Liberty of making his Defence.</HI> Upon which the Court said, <HI>That no Advantage should be taken against him, and that he should have Liberty, and should be heard. W. Penn</HI> then said, <HI>That he pleaded not guilty in Manner and Form.</HI> Then <HI>W. Mead</HI> was demanded, Whether he was guilty or not guilty, and he answered the same as <HI>W. Penn.</HI> The Court then proceed∣ed with the Business of trying Thieves and Murderers, making the Pri∣soners stay waiting five Hours, and then returned them to Prison; and after two Days brought them again before the Court. And then the Officers of the Court having taken off the Prisoners Hats, the Lord Mayor, <HI>Samuel Starling,</HI> shewed himself displeased with it, and ordered the Officers to put on their Hats again; which being done, the Recor∣der, <HI>John Howell,</HI> who upon all Occasions shewed his F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erceness, accu∣sed them that they showed no Respects to the Court, and condemned them for it in a Fine of Forty Marks each, because they had not taken off their Hats. Thereupon <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>That he desired it might be ob∣served, that they came into the Court with their Hats off, (that is, taken off) and if they have been put on since, it is by Order from the Bench, and therefore not the Prisoners but the Bench should be fined.</HI> The Jury then being sworn, and the Indictment read again, the Witnesses were called, who declared, That they saw <HI>W. Penn</HI> speaking to the People, who were assembled in a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>Grace-church-street,</HI> but they could not hear what he said.</P>
<P>The Recorder then asked <HI>William Mead, Whether he was there?</HI> who an∣swered, <HI>That 'tis a Maxim in your own Law,</HI> Nemo tenetur accusare seipsum, <HI>which if it be not true</HI> Latin, <HI>I am sure it is good</HI> English, <HI>That no Man is bound to accuse himself; why then dost thou offer to ensnare me with such a Que∣stion?</HI> Hereupon the Recorder shewed himself so displeased, that he said, <HI>Sir, hold your Tongue, I did not go about to insnare you.</HI> Then <HI>William Penn</HI> said, <HI>We confess our selves to be so far from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecanting or declining to vindicate the assembling of our selves, to preach, pray, or worship the eternal, holy, just God, that we declare to all the World, that we do believe it to be our indispen∣sable Duty, to meet incessantly upon so good an Account; nor shall all the Powers upon Earth be able to divert us from reverencing and adoring our God, who made us.</HI> The Sheriff <HI>Richard Brown</HI> said, <HI>You are not here for worshipping God, but for breaking the Law. You do your selves a great deal of Wrong in going on in that Discourse.</HI> Hereupon <HI>W. Penn</HI> answered, <HI>I affirm I have broken no Law, nor am I guilty of the Indictment that is laid to my Charge: And to the End, the Bench, the Jury and my self, with these that hear us, may have a more direct Ʋnderstanding of this Proceedure, I desire you would let me know by what Law it is you prosecute me, and upon what Law you ground my Indictment?</HI> The Recorder answered, <HI>Ʋpon the common Law. Where is,</HI> asked <HI>W.Penn, that common Law? You must not think,</HI> said the Recorder, <HI>That I am able to
<PB N="479" REF="003104_0490_0FEFF79F70340AC8"/>
run up so many Years, and over so many adjudged Cases, which we call Common Law, to answer your Curiosity. This Answer,</HI> replied <HI>W. Penn, I am sure is very short of my Question, for if it be common, it should not be so hard to produce.</HI> The Recorder replied, <HI>Sir, will you plead to your Indictment? Shall I,</HI> an∣swered <HI>W. Penn, plead to an Indictment, that hath no Foundation in Law? If it contain that Law you say I have broken, why should you decline to produce that Law, since it will be impossible for the Jury to determine, or agree to bring in their Verdict, who have not the Law produced, by which they should measure the Truth of this Indictment, and the Guilt or contrary of my Fact.</HI> The Recor∣der being angry, said, <HI>You are a sawcy Fellow, speak to the Indictment. W. Penn</HI> replied, <HI>I say, it is my Place to speak to Matter of Law; I am arraign∣ed a Prisoner, my Liberty, which is next to Life it self, is now concerned,</HI> &amp;c. And at this Time several upon the Bench urged hard upon the Prison∣er to bear him down. <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>You are many Mouths and Ears against me, and if I must not be allowed to make the best of my Cause, it is hard; I say again, unless you shew me and the People the Law you ground your Indict∣ment upon. I shall take it for granted, your Proceedings are meerly arbitrary.</HI> The Recorder then replying, said. <HI>The Question is Whether you are guilty of this Indictment. The Question,</HI> said <HI>W. Penn, is not whether I am guilty of this Indictment, but whether this Indictment be Legal: It is too general and im∣perfect an Answer, to say it is the common Law, unless we know both where, and what it is; for where there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no Law, there is no Transgression; and that Law which is not in Being, is so far from being Common, that it is no Law at all.</HI> The Recorder snapped him hereupon with, <HI>You are an impertinent Fellow, will you teach the Court what Law is? It's</HI> Lex non scripta, <HI>that which many have studied thirty or forty Years to know, and would you have me tell you in a Moment? Certainly,</HI> replied <HI>W. Penn, if the Common Law be so hard to be un∣derstood, it is far from being very common; but if the Lord</HI> Coke <HI>in his Insti∣tutes be of any Consideration, he tells us, that common Law is common Right, and that common Right is the great Charter Priviledges, confirmed</HI> 9 Hen 3.29 25 Edw. 1.1. 2 Edw. 3.8. Coke's <HI>Institutes,</HI> 2. p. 56. The Re∣corder taking no Pleasure in that Speech, said, <HI>Sir, You are a trouble some Fellow, and it is not for the Honour of the Court to suffer you to go on. I have,</HI> replied <HI>W. Penn, asked but one Question, and you have not answered me, tho' the Rights and Priviledges of every</HI> Englishman <HI>be concerned in it. Well,</HI> said the Recorder, <HI>if I should suffer you to ask Questions till to morrow Morning you would be never the wiser. That is,</HI> said <HI>W. Penn, according as the Answers are.</HI> But says the Recorder, <HI>We must not stand to hear you talk all Night.</HI> Where∣upon <HI>W. Penn</HI> replied, <HI>I desire no Affront to the Court, but to be heard in my just Plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and I must plainly tell you, that if you deny me the Oyer of that Law, which you suggest I have broken, you do at once deny me an acknowledged Right, and evidence to the whole World your Resolution to sacrifice the Priviledges of</HI> Englishmen <HI>to your sinister and arbitrary Designs.</HI> This so enraged the Re∣corder, that he called to the Officers, <HI>Take him away.</HI> And to the Lord Mayor he said, <HI>My Lord, if you take not some Course with this pestilent Fel∣low, to stop his Mouth, we shall not be able to do any Thing to Night.</HI> Then the Lord Mayor cryed, <HI>Take him away, take him away, turn him into the Bale-dock. W. Penn</HI> seeing how Force and Violence prevailed, said, <HI>These are but so many vain Exclamations. Is this Justice or true Judgment? Must I therefore be taken away because I plead for the fundamental Laws of</HI> England. Then addressing himself to the Jury, he said, <HI>However, this I leave upon your Consciences, who are of the Jury, and my sole Judges, that if these ancient fundamental Laws which relate to Liberty and Property, and are not limited to particular Perswasions in Matters of Religion, must not be indispensably main∣tained and observed, who can say he hath Right to the Coat upon his Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k? Cer∣tainly our Liberties are openly to be invaded, our Wives to be ravished, our Children enslaved, our Families ruined, and our Estates led away in Triumph</HI></P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="003104_0491_0FEFF7E132C05328"/>He being now haled into the Bale-dock, it was <HI>W. Mead</HI>'s Turn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plead, who spoke thus: <HI>Ye Men of the Jury, I now stand here to answer to an Indictment against me, which is a Bundle of Stuff full of Lyes and Falshoods; for therein I am accused, that I met</HI> vi &amp; armis, illicite &amp; tumultuose. <HI>Time was when I had Freedom to use a carnal Weapon, and then I thought I feared no Man: But now I fear the living God, and dare not make use thereof, nor hurt any Man, nor do I know I demeaned my self as a tumultuous Person. I say I am a peaceable Man; therefore it is a very proper Question what</HI> W. Penn <HI>demanded in this Case, an Oyer of the Law, on which our Indictment is grounded.</HI> To this the Recorder said, <HI>I have made an Answer to that al∣ready. W. Mead</HI> then turning his Face to the Jury, said, <HI>Ye Men of the Jury, who are my Judges, if the Recorder will not tell you what makes a Riot, a Rout, or unlawful Assembly,</HI> Cook, <HI>he that once they called the Lord</HI> Cook, <HI>tells us what makes a Riot, a Rout, or unlawful Assembly. — A Riot is when three or more are met together to beat a Man, or to enter forcibly into ano∣ther Man's Land, to cut down his Grass, his Wood, or break down his Pales.</HI> The Recorder interrupting him, and scornfully pulling off his Hat said, <HI>I thank you Sir, that you will tell me what the Law is:</HI> And <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> that inveterate Enemy of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> said, <HI>He talks at Random, one while an</HI> Independent, <HI>another while of some other Religion, and now a</HI> Quaker, <HI>and next a</HI> Papist. <HI>Mead,</HI> not being minded openly to affront this Al∣derman, told him this well known <HI>Latin</HI> Verse,</P>
<P><HI>Turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Brown</HI> himself formerly had been an <HI>Independent,</HI> tho' now he be∣longed to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and was of the Court Party. But the Lord Mayor, who it seems was a great Friend of <HI>Brown</HI>'s, said to <HI>Mead, You deserve to have your Tongue cut out. And,</HI> added the Recorder, <HI>If you discourse on this Manner, I shall take Occasion against you.</HI> To which <HI>Mead</HI> returned, <HI>Thou didst promise me I should have fair Liberty to be heard. Why may I not have the Privilege of an</HI> English Man, <HI>and you might be ashamed of this Dealing.</HI> At this the envious Recorder said, <HI>I look upon you to be an Enemy to the Laws of</HI> England, <HI>which ought to be obser∣ved and kept; nor are you worthy of such Privileges as others have. Mead</HI> well seeing that Force and Violence prevailed, and that his speaking could not avail him, said, with a composed Mind, <HI>The Lord be Judge between me and thee in this Matter.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which he was taken away into the Bale-dock, and the Recorder gave the Jury the following Charge; <Q>You have heard what the Indict∣ment is; it is for preaching to the People, and drawing a tumultuous Company after them; and Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> was speaking. If they should not be disturbed, you see they will go on; there are Three or Four Wit∣nesses, that have proved this that he did preach there; that Mr. <HI>Mead</HI> did allow of it; after this, you have heard by substantial Witnesses what is said against them. Now we are upon the Matter of Fact, which you are to keep to, and observe, as what hath been fully sworn, at your Peril.</Q> That the Recorder spoke thus to the Jury in the Absence of the Prisoners, was indeed irregular; wherefore <HI>W. Penn,</HI> who heard this from a far, spoke with a very raised Voice, that so, he might be heard by those on the Bench, after this Manner, <Q>I appeal to the Jury, who are my Judges, and to this great Assembly, whe∣ther the Proceedings of the Court are not most arbitrary, and void of all Law, in offering to give the Jury their Charge in the Absence of the Prisoners. I say it is directly opposite to, and destructive of the undoubted Right of every <HI>English</HI> Prisoner, as <HI>Cook in the</HI> 2 Inst. <HI>on the Chapter of</HI> Magna Charta <HI>speaks.</HI></Q> The Recorder being thus unex∣pectedly lasht for his extra-judicial Procedure, said with a disdainful
<PB N="481" REF="003104_0492_0FEFF7A1501E4438"/>
Smile, <HI>Why, ye are present; you do hear, do you not?</HI> To which <HI>Penn</HI> re∣turned, <HI>No Thanks to the Court, that commanded me into the Bale-dock: And you of the Jury take Notice, that I have not been heard, neither can you legally depart the Court, before I have been fully heard, having at least ten or twelve material Points to offer, in Order to invalidate their Indictment.</HI> This plain Speaking of <HI>W. Penn</HI> so enraged the Recorder, that he cryed, <HI>Pull that Fellow down, pull him down:</HI> For <HI>Penn,</HI> it seems, to be heard the better, was clamber'd up a little by the Rails of the Bale-dock. Then <HI>W. Mead</HI> said, <HI>Are these according to the Rights and Privileges of</HI> Englishmen, <HI>that we should not be heard, but turned into the Bale-dock, for making our Defence; and the Jury to have their Charge given them in our Absence? I say, these are barbarous and unjust Proceedings.</HI> The Recorder yet more incensed, cryed, <HI>Take them away into the Hole: To hear them talk all Nights, as they would, that I think doth not become the Honour of the Court.</HI></P>
<P>The Prisoners then being kept in a stinking Hole, the Jury were commanded up, to agree upon their Verdict: And after an Hour and half's Time eight came down agreed, but four remained above: The Court then sent an Officer for them, and they accordingly came down. And then the Court used many indecent Threats to the four that dis∣sented; and after much menacing Language, and a very imperious Be∣haviour against the Jury, the Prisoners being brought to the Bar, the Foreman was askt, <HI>How say you? Is</HI> William Penn <HI>guilty of the Matter where∣of he stands indicted in Manner and Form, or not guilty?</HI> Fore-man; <HI>Guilty of speaking in</HI> Grace-Church-street. The next Question was, <HI>Is that all?</HI> Foreman; <HI>That is all I have in Commission.</HI> This Answer so displeased the Recorder, that he said, <HI>You had as good say nothing.</HI> And the Lord May∣or <HI>Starling</HI> said, <HI>Was it not an unlawful Assembly? You mean he was speak∣ing to a Tumult of People there?</HI> To which the Foreman returned, <HI>My Lord, This was all I had in Commission.</HI> Some of the Jury seemed now to buckle to the Questions of the Court: but others opposed themselves, and said, <HI>They allowed of no such Word as an</HI> unlawful Assembly <HI>in their Verdict:</HI> At which some on the Bench took Occasion to vilify them with opprobrious Language. And because the Court would not dismiss the Jury before they gave a more satisfactory Verdict, they called for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and so went up again: And after half an Hour returning, delivered the following Verdict in Writing.</P>
<P><HI>We the Jurors hereafter named, do find</HI> William Penn <HI>to be guilty of speak∣ing or preaching to an Assembly met together in</HI> Grace-church-street <HI>the 14th of</HI> August <HI>last,</HI> 1670, <HI>and that</HI> William Mead <HI>is not guilty of the said Indictment.</HI></P>

<P>This Verdict the Mayor and Recorder resented at so high a Rate, that they exceeded the Bounds of all Moderation and Civility; and the Recorder said, <HI>Gentlemen, you shall not be dismissed till we have a Verdict, that the Court will accept; and you shall be locked up, without Meat, Drink, Fire and Tobacco: You shall not think thus to abuse the Court: We will have a Ver∣dict by the Help of God, or you shall starve for it.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' the Jury had given in their Verdict, and signified that they could give no other, yet all was in rain; and <HI>W. Penn</HI> seeing how they were treated against all Reason, said, <HI>My Jury, who are my Judges, ought not to be thus menaced; their Verdict should be free, and not compelled; the Bench ought to wait upon them, but not forestal them.

the Measure of my Jury's Verdict.</HI> This modest Speech so incensed the Recorder, that he cryed, <HI>Stop that prating Fellow's Mouth, or put him out of the Court.</HI> And the Lord Mayor said to the Jury, <HI>You have heard that he preached, that he gathered a Company of tumultuous People, and that they do not only disobey the martial Power, but the civil also.</HI> To which <HI>W. Penn</HI> return∣ed, <HI>That's a great Mistake; we did not make the Tumult, but they that inter∣rupted in. The Jury cannot be so ignorant, as to think, that we met there with a Design to disturb the Civil Peace, since (First,) we were by Force of Arms kept out of our lawful House, and met as near it in the Street as the Soldiers would give Leave. And (Secondly,) because it was no new Thing, nor with the Circumstances expressed in the Indictment, but what was usual and customary with us. It's very well known that we are a peaceable People, and cannot offer Violence to any Man.</HI></P>
<P>The Court now being resolved to send the Prisoners to their Jail, and the Jury to their Chamber, <HI>Penn</HI> spoke as followeth, <HI>The Agreement of twelve Men is a Verdict in Law, and such an one being given by the Jury, I re∣quire the Clerk of the Peace to record it, as he will answer it at his Peril. And if the Jury bring in another Verdict, contradictory to this, I affirm they are perjured Men in Law.</HI> And looking upon the Jury, said, <HI>You are</HI> English∣men, <HI>mind your Privilege; give not away your Right.</HI> To which <HI>E. Bushel,</HI> one of them, returned, <HI>Nor will we ever do it.</HI> Another of the Jurymen pleaded Indisposition of Body, and therefore desired to be dismiss'd; but the Lord Mayor said, <HI>You are as strong as any of them; starve them, and hold your Principles.</HI> To which the Recorder added, <HI>Gentlemen, you must be content with your hard Fate; let your Patience overcome it; for the Court is resol∣ved to have a Verdict, and that before you can be dismiss'd.</HI> And tho' the Jury∣men said, <HI>We are agreed, we are agreed, we are agreed,</HI> yet the Court swore several Persons, to keep the Jury all Night, without Meat, Drink, Fire, or any other Accommodation; nay, they had not so much as a Cham∣ber-pot, tho' desired. Thus Force and Violence prevail'd. The next Day, tho' it was the first of the Week, vulgarly called <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Court sat again; and the Prisoners being brought to the Bar, the Jury were called in, and their Foreman was ask'd, <HI>Is</HI> William Penn <HI>guilty of the Matter whereof he stands indicted, in Manner and Form aforesaid, or not guilty?</HI> To which he answered as before, William Penn <HI>is guilty of speak∣ing in Grace-church-street.</HI> The Lord Mayor then asking, <HI>To an unlawful Assembly? Edward Bushel</HI> answered, <HI>No, my Lord, we give no other Verdict than what we gave last Night; we have no other Verdict to give. You are,</HI> re∣turned the Lord Mayor, <HI>a factious Fellow: I'll take a Course with you. I have,</HI> said <HI>Bushel, done according to my, Conscience.</HI> This so displeased the Mayor, that he said, <HI>That Conscience of yours would cut my Throat; but I will cut yours so soon as I can.</HI> To which the Recorder added, <HI>He has inspired the Jury; he has the Spirit of Divination; methinks I feel him: I will have a positive Verdict, or you shall starve for it.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>I desire to ask the</HI> Recorder <HI>one Question: Do you al∣low of the Verdict given of</HI> W. Mead? To which the Recorder answer'd, <HI>It cannot be a Verdict, because you are indicted for a Conspiracy; and one bring found</HI> Not guilty, <HI>and not the other, it cannot be a Verdict.</HI> This made <HI>Penn</HI> say, <HI>If</HI> Not guilty <HI>be not a Verdict, then you make of the Jury and</HI> Mag∣na Charta <HI>but a meer Nose of Wax. How!</HI> ask'd <HI>William Mead</HI> then, <HI>Is</HI> Not guilty, <HI>no Verdict? No,</HI> said the Recorder, <HI>it is no Verdict.</HI> To which <HI>Penn</HI> replied, <HI>I affirm that the Consent of a Jury is a Verdict in Law; and if</HI> W. Mead <HI>he not guilty, it consequently follows, that I am clear, since you have indicted us of Conspiracy, and I could not possibly conspire alone.</HI> After this, the Court spoke to the Jury, and caused them to go up again, if possible to extort another Verdict from them. Then the Jury being called, and ask'd by the Clerk, <HI>What say you? Is</HI> William Penn <HI>guilty of the Matter whereof he stands indicted, in Manner and Form aforesaid, or not guilty?</HI>
<PB N="483" REF="003104_0494_0FEFF7A3733A0380"/>
The Foreman answered, <HI>Guilty of speaking in</HI> Grace-church-street. To which the Recorder returned, <HI>What is this to the Purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say I will have a Verdict.</HI> And speaking to <HI>E. Bushel,</HI> said, <HI>You are a facti∣ous Fellow, I will set a Mark upon you; am whilst I have any thing to do in the City, I will have an Eye upon you.</HI> To this the Mayor added, <HI>Have you no more Wit than to be led by such a pitiful Fellow? I will cut his Nose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Thus the Court endeavoured to baffle the Jury; and therefore it was not without very good Reason that <HI>William Penn</HI> said, <HI>It is intolerable that my Jury should be thus menaced: Is this according to the Fundamental Laws? Are not they my proper Judges by the Great Charter of</HI> England? <HI>What hope is there of ever having Justice done, when Juries are threatned, and their Verdict is rejected? I am concerned to speak, and grieved to see such arbitrary Proceedings. Did not the Lieutenant of the Tower render one of them worse than a Felon? And do you not plainly seek to condemn such for factious Fellows who answer not your Ends! Ʋnhappy are those Juries, who are threat∣ened be fined, and starved, and ruined, if they give not in their Verdicts con∣trary to their Consciences.</HI> These plain Expressions so troubled the Re∣corder, that he said to the Lord Mayor, <HI>My Lord, you must take a Course with this Fellow.</HI> And then the Mayor cry'd, <HI>Stop his Mouth; Jailor bring Fet∣ters, and stake him to the Ground.</HI> To which <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>Do your Pleasure; I matter not your Fetters.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Recorder commend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the Policy and Prudence of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Inquisition, and wants to have it intro∣duced have, and threatens with a new Law.</NOTE> The Recorder then ventur'd to say, <HI>Till now I never understood the Reason of the Policy and Prudence of the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>in suf∣fering the Inquisition among them. And certainly it will never be well with us, till something like the</HI> Spanish <HI>Inquisition be in</HI> England. The Jury being re∣quired to find another Verdict, and they saying they could give no o∣ther, the Recorder grew so angry, that he said, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> we shall not be at this pass always with you; you will find the next Session of Parliament there will be a Law made, that those that will not conform, shall not have the Pro∣tection of the Law.—Your Verdict is nothing, you play upon the Court.

<P>The Jury refusing to give in another Verdict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbarous Usage of the Jury.</NOTE> since they had all agreed to that which they had given, and shewing themselves unwilling to go up again, the Lord Mayor bid the Sheriff to make them go. The She∣riff then coming off his Seat, said, <HI>Come, Gentlemen, you must go up; you see I am commanded to make you go.</HI> Upon which the Jury went up, and several were sworn to keep them without any Accommodation as afore∣said, till they brought in their Verdict. And the Prisoners were remand∣ed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where they remaining till next Morning, then were brought to the Court again. And being set to the Bar, and the Jury call'd, and ask'd, <HI>Is</HI> William Penn <HI>guilty of the Matter whereof he stands in∣dicted in Manner and Form,</HI> &amp;c, <HI>or not guilty?</HI> The Foreman answered, <HI>You have there read in Writing already our Verdict, and our Hands subscribed.</HI> Now the Clerk, who had that Paper, was by the Recorder stopt from reading it; and it was said by the Court, <HI>That Paper was no Verdict.</HI> Then the Clerk ask'd, <HI>How say you? Is</HI> William Penn <HI>guilty,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>or not guilty?</HI> To which the Foreman Answered, <HI>Not Guility.</HI> The same Question be∣ing put concerning <HI>W.

<P><HI>W. Penn</HI> then stepping up towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, said <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Liber∣ty,

being freed by the Jury. No,</HI> said the Lord Mayor, <HI>you are in for your Fines. Fines?</HI> returned <HI>Penn, for what? For Contempt of the Court,</HI> said the Lord Mayor. <HI>I ask,</HI> reply'd <HI>Penn, if it be according to the Fundamental Laws of</HI> England, <HI>that any</HI> Englishman <HI>should be fined or amerced, but by the Judg∣ment of his Peers or Jury? Since it expresly contradicts the 14th and 29th Chap∣ter of the Great Charter of</HI> England, <HI>which say, No Freeman ought to be amer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, but by the Oath of good and lawful Men of the Vicinage.</HI> Instead of answer∣ing to this Question, the Recorder cry'd, <HI>Take him away, take him away; Take him out of the Court.</HI> On which <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>I can never urge the Fundamental Laws of</HI> England, <HI>but you cry,</HI> Take him away, Take him a∣way. <HI>But it is no Wonder, since the</HI> Spanish <HI>Inquisition hath so great a Place in the Recorder's Heart. God Almighty, who is just, will judge you all for these Things. W. Penn</HI> was not suffered to speak any more, but he and <HI>W. Mead</HI> were haled to the Bale-dock, and from thence sent to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and so were their Jury. How they came at length to be freed, I do not know.</P>
<P>This Trial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">To which the Reader is referr'd, as well worthy his Perusal.</NOTE> was afterwards publish'd in Print more at large than is set down here, and an Appendix subjoyned to it; in which are shewed not only the Invalidity of the Evidence, but also the Absurdity of the In∣dictment, and the illegal Proceedings of the Court; and from the Great Charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the Case of the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Keel∣ing,</HI> the Prac∣tice of fining Juries for their Verdicts declared il∣legal.</NOTE> that they had been dealt with contrary to Law.

And therefore, <HI>That he should be brought to Trial, in order to condign Punishment, in such Manner as the House should judge most fit and requisite.</HI> Two Days after, <HI>viz. Die Veneris,</HI> the 13th of <HI>December,</HI> it was resolved, <HI>That the Precedents and Practice of fining or im∣prisoning Jurors for Verdicts, is illegal.</HI> The Book containing the fore∣mentioned Trial of <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>W. Mead</HI> was reprinted I think more than once; for it came to be much in Request, because the Liberties of the People were therein well defended, and arbitrary Power controlled. The Title of it was, <HI>The People's Ancient and Just Liberties asserted;</HI> and underneath was added this well known Verse or <HI>Juvenal,</HI></P>
<Q>Sic volo, sic jubeo; stat pro ratione voluntas.</Q>
<P>This Matter was more circumstantially treated of in a Book in Print,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther Ac∣count of these Proceedings published by <HI>T. Rudyard,</HI> who for de∣fending the Oppressed is himself vio∣lently prose∣cuted.</NOTE> by <HI>Thomas Rudyard</HI> a Lawyer, who shewed therein at large the Right of Juries, and the Unlawfulness of the Proceedings then in Vogue; which he made appear plainly, both from Law and by Citations from the Books of eminent Lawyers. And having sometimes vigorously pleaded the Cause of the Oppressed, he also became the Object of persecuting Fury, which could not endure his faithful defending of the Innocent. And there∣fore this Summer the Magistrates of <HI>London</HI> issued out a Warrant to break open his House in the Dead of the Night, in Order to apprehend him; and this Warrant was executed by the Soldiers of one Captain <HI>Holford;</HI> and the next Day he was sent to <HI>Newgate</HI> by a <HI>Mittimus</HI> under the Hands and Seals of the Lord Mayor <HI>Samuel Starling, William Peak, Robert Hanson,</HI> and several others, under Pretence, <HI>That he stirred up Persons to Dis∣obedience of the Laws, and abetted and encouraged such as met in unlawful and seditious Conventicles, contrarry to the late Act.</HI> But his Case being brought before the Justices of the Court of <HI>Common-pleas</HI> at <HI>Westminster</HI> by an <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> that Court, after solemn Debate, gave their Judgment, <HI>That</HI> Thomas Rudyard <HI>was unjustly imprisoned, and unlawfully detained.</HI>
<PB N="485" REF="003104_0496_0FEFF7A5AADB0220"/>
And so he was set at Liberty. But the Lord Mayor <HI>S. Starling</HI> fretting at his Discharge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But remov∣ing his Cause to the Common-Pleas is ac∣quitted.</NOTE> found out new Stratagems to compass his Ends upon him. For an Indictment was formed against him for having hindred due Course of Law against one <HI>Samuel Allingbridge.</HI> But <HI>Rudyard</HI> so well defended himself, that he was acquitted; which so incensed the Lord Mayor, that not long after he was again committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> on a religious Account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And again, in another Prosecution. He is again preceeded a∣gainst for be∣ing at a Meet∣ing; an Ac∣count of which he printed.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> for having been in the Meeting at <HI>White-Hart-Court</HI> in <HI>Grace-Church-street.</HI> The Proceedings against him and others on that Account were no less arbitrary than those against <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>W. Mead</HI> already mentioned, and therefore <HI>Rudyard</HI> exposed his and their Tryals in Print; and seeing he understood the Law, he was the more able to shew the Unjustness of these Proceedings, and how inconsistent such Prosecutions were with the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>But to avoid Prolixity, I shall relate but little of them, since many Things occur therein, which have been mentioned already in other Ca∣ses. How the Recorder <HI>Howel</HI> was inclined in respect to Religion, may be deduced from what hath been said already of his Panegyrick upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Inquisition. And to <HI>Rudyard</HI> and his Fellow-Prisoners he gave no obscure Evidence what Religion he preferred;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Touch at the Religion of <HI>Howel</HI> the Recorder.</NOTE> for they saying, <HI>That they were always quiet and peaceable in their Assemblies, and that the Laws against Riots were never intended against them, but Popish, or such like Distur∣bers of the Peace.</HI> The Recorder returned, <HI>That the</HI> Papists <HI>were better Subjects to the King, than they were; and that they were a stubborn and dange∣rous People, and must either be brought under, or there was no safe living by them.</HI> The Prisoners offering to vindicate themselves from these odious and soul Aspersions, were not suffered to say any Thing in their own Defence; but instead of hearing them, they were by Order of the Lord Mayor and the Recorder thrust into the Bale-dock, and treated almost at the same Rate as <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>W. Mead</HI> had been before.</P>
<P>But Violence prevailed now; and the Recorder, because of his out∣ragious Behaviour against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> was so much in Favour of the Court of Justice, that Alderman <HI>Jo. Robinson</HI> did not stick to tell them, <HI>That the Recorder deserved an hundred Pounds for his Service done at the</HI> Old Baily <HI>the last Sessions.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To whom 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> is order'd to be paid for his good Service, by the Cham∣berlain of <HI>London,</HI> as had 200<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be∣fore.</NOTE> And his Proposal so took, that the Court con∣sented to pay him for the said Service an hundred Pounds by the Chamberlain of <HI>London.</HI> And since this was very well known to <HI>T. Rudyard,</HI> insomuch that in a Book he published, he named the Date of the said Order, <HI>viz.</HI> the Eighth of <HI>October,</HI> 1670; and that, other Orders that had been given for two Hundred Pounds more to him, within eight Months last past; he, to reprehend such Doings in a Saty∣rical Way, called them, <HI>An excellent Way to ease the Treasury of being over∣burthened with Orphans-Money, by which sinister Ends, and cursed Dispositions of its Cash, the Chamber was so deeply in Debt, that it was almost incredible.</HI></P>
<P>Now since <HI>Rudyard</HI> as a Lawyer, had a more full Knowledge of these unlawful Proceedings against him and his Friends, than many others, he composed a Treatise of those Prosecutions, which he called, <HI>The Second Part of the Peoples Ancient and Just Liberties, asserted.</HI> And true Lovers of their Country were pleased with it: For that Party, which countenanced Popery, and therefore endeavoured to violate the People's Rights, strove to get the upper Hand.</P>
<P>Persecution was now very hot and fierce all over the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wicked Fel∣lows encou∣raged to be∣come Infor∣mers against Dissenters.</NOTE> because a Door was opened for all base and wicked Fellows to get Booty by informing; for by the Act against Meetings (which, tho' religious, were branded with the Name of <HI>Seditious)</HI> the Informer was to have a third Part of the imposed Fine. This set on many vile Persons, and among these sometimes Thieves and infamous Fellows, to render any Comings together of <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' it was but a Visit, or a Burial, the Name of
<PB N="486" REF="003104_0497_0FEFF7E91B792078"/>
a Meeting, and to swear that a Meeting had been kept there. Nay, sometimes they swore only by guess, that in such a Place a Meeting had been kept, tho' the Witnesses had not seen it, as was requisite by Law. And this informing came so much in Vogue, that some Magi∣strates themselves turned Informers.</P>

<P>I might write a large Volume of these abominable Deeds, if I could find Leisure for it; yet now and then I'll mention a few Instances, by which the Reader may make a Conjecture of the rest.</P>
<P>This Year at <HI>Alford</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Persons fined for having been at a Bu∣rial.</NOTE> in the Month called <HI>August,</HI> the Corps of one <HI>Samuel Clothier</HI> was buried, and tho' in the Burying-Place all were silent, yet the Justice <HI>Robert Hunt</HI> fined some that had been at the Burial, for having assisted at this pretended Meeting.</P>
<P>In <HI>Nottingham</HI> it happened in the latter End of this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Extrava∣gancy of Ju∣stice <HI>Whaley</HI> against the <HI>Quakers</HI> at <HI>Nottingham</HI> asserting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Eliz.</HI> was not made against Papists.</NOTE> that the Justice, <HI>Penniston Whaley,</HI> who had fined many of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> for frequenting their religious Meetings, encouraged the People at the Sessions to persecute the <HI>Quakers</HI> without any Pity, saying to them, <HI>Harden your Hearts against them: For the Act of the 35th of Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>is not made against the Papists; since the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>is a true Church, as well as any other Church; but these</HI> Quakers <HI>are erroneous and seditious Persons.</HI> By these Words one may easily judge to what Religion this Justice of Peace was inclined; but such D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>semblers feigned to be Protestants, that so they might bear honourable Offices. I pass by unmentioned many Per∣sons, who by beating, pushing, and trampling, were grievously abused in their Meetings, to that Degree that some not long survived the Violence committed against them, and felt the Painfulness or Smart of it till Death.</P>
<P>This Year about <HI>Midsummer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pious Death of <HI>Tho.

<P>At <HI>Warbor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were also most grie∣vously abused in their religious Meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelties at <HI>Warborrow</HI> in <HI>Oxon.</HI></NOTE> and even aged Women not spared, which often caused the Cry of innocent Children to go up to Heaven, when they saw their Mothers thus ill treated. For Magistrates themselves to break their Canes to pieces on those that were met toge∣ther, was but an ordinary Thing; and then sometimes other Sticks were made Use of: Often also Women were stripp'd of their upper Gar∣ments; and this accompanied with the Spoil of Goods. That the Per∣secutors were thus inraged, was not strange, when we consider that some were sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd up to it by their Teachers; an Instance of which was given by <HI>Robert Priest</HI> of the same Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Profane Words of their Teacher <HI>Ro∣bert Priest.</HI></NOTE> who once said his Sermon, <HI>That the King's Laws, tho' they were contrary to the Law of God, yet ought to be obeyed.</HI> Quite otherwise was the Doctrine of the Apostles <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> when they said to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Council, <HI>Judge ye whether it be right in the Sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> where Persecution was also very hot, the Bishop of <HI>Peterborough</HI> said publickly in the Steeple-house, after he had com∣manded the Officers to put in Execution the last Act against seditious Meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel Say∣ing of the Bishop of <HI>Pe∣terborough</HI> in <HI>Northamp¦tonshire.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Against all Phanaticks it hath done its Business, except the</HI> Quakers: <HI>But when the Parliament sits again, a stronger Law will be made, not only to take away their Lands and Goods, but also to sell them for Bond-slaves.</HI> Thus the Churchmen blew the Fire of Persecution.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="003104_0498_0FEFF7A8C4644098"/>At <HI>York</HI> the spoiling of Goods was also fiercely driven on by Alder∣man <HI>Richardson;</HI> and even Boys and Girls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alderman <HI>Richardson</HI>'s Proceedings at <HI>York.</HI></NOTE> that were under sixteeen Years of Age, and therefore not subject to the Penalty of the Law, were also fined; and when the Constables shew'd themselves unwilling to as∣sist in the Robbery, they were snarl'd at, and one prosecuted for not performing his Duty, because he had refused to take away a Man's Cloak. But if I should mention the ill Usage committed in all Coun∣ties and Places, when should I come to a Conclusion!</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Green,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tho.

<P>At another Time the Justices <HI>Peter Soams</HI> and <HI>Thomas Mead</HI> gave a Warrant to distrain 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> worth of Goods from the said <HI>Thomas Green,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">As another Time they seize all his Shop Goods.</NOTE> for preaching at a Meeting at <HI>Ʋpper-Chissel</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI> And the Officers going to <HI>Thomas Green</HI>'s Shop, took all they could get, leaving nothing in the Shop but a Skein of Thread, which was fallen on the Ground, and not observed by them.</P>
<P><HI>Theophilus Green</HI> suffered also great Spoil of Goods:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tho.

<P>The Week following, he being at <HI>Ʋxbridge,</HI> and visiting some poor Children of his Friends, whose Father and Mother died shortly one after another, he took two of them as his own, and look'd after the disposing of the rest. And staying there till the First-day of the Week, he went to the Meeting, and exhorted his Friends, <HI>To keep their Meet∣ings in the Name of Jesus;</HI> at the speaking of which Words the Consta∣ble and Informer came in, and carried him away to Justice <HI>Ralph Haw∣trey,</HI> who fin'd him 20<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and sent him Prisoner to <HI>Newgate</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> with a <HI>Mittimus;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Warrant a∣gainst him by Justice <HI>Haw∣trey.</HI></NOTE> wherein he charged him, That <HI>he had exhorted the Peo∣ple to keep their Meetings in the Name of Jesus, notwithstanding the Laws of Men to the contrary.</HI> Warrants being issued forth to make Distress for the above mention'd Fines, which amounted to 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> they came and open'd his Doors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther very serve Procee∣dings against him.</NOTE> and took away all his Goods they found, leaving him neither Bed nor Stool. And after he had been kept Prisoner three Months, he with seven more was brought to the Sessions-House at <HI>Hicks's-Hall,</HI> and the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy were tender'd to them. To which his Plea was, <HI>As an</HI> Englishman <HI>I ought either to be acquitted or condemned, for the Cause for which I was committed, before I should answer to any other Matter or Cause. Besides, I look upon my self to be ille∣gally committed, as being fined and committed for the same Fact.</HI> But they told him, <HI>He must answer whether he would swear or no, and then he should be heard.</HI> But continuing to refuse Swearing, he was remanded to Prison with the rest; and afterwards being sent for again, and still unwilling to break Christ's Command, <HI>Not to swear at all,</HI> the Sentence of <HI>Premunire</HI> was read against him and his Fellow Prisoners, and so they continued in Jail above two Years, till they were discharged by an Act of Grace from the King.</P>

<P>On the 9th of the said Month the Soldiers, both Horse and Foot, came again to the Meeting at the aforesaid Place, and one of them ha∣ving a Snovel, threw the Dirt and Mire from the Channels on both Men and Women; and after him the Horse and Foot came, and fell upon them, striking and knocking down, without respect to Age or Sex, un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Blood from many; and when some of the Inhabitants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pity took them into their Houses, to save their Lives, the Soldiers forced open the Doors, and haled them into the Street again, and pluck'd on their Hats, that they might strike on their bare heads; insomuch that many had their Heads grievously broken. Some Troopers also tore the Womens Clothes off their Backs, and haled them thro' the Mire by their Horse-sides; and some of the Foot-Soldiers put their Hands in a most shameful Manner under the Womens Coats: Nay, a Soldier twice struck a Woman, that was big with Child, with his Mus∣ket on the Belly, and once on the Breast, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s nother hung Dirt in her Face: So that she miscarried.

Therefore he did not give himself Rest, till by the Help of others he obtained from the King a Discharge under the Great Seal, to clear both her and her Estate, after she had been ten Years a Prisoner and premunired. This Royal Order he sent forth∣with down to her, and thus she was set at Liberty.</P>
<P>Now since the Heat of Persecution began to cool,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concludes on a Voyage for <HI>America.</HI> and sets Sail.</NOTE> he felt himself in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to make a Voyage to <HI>America,</HI> to visit his Friends there; of this his Intention he gave Notice to his Wife by a Letter, and desired her to come up to <HI>London;</HI> which she did accordingly.

It is to be Informers.</Q></P>
<P>Next the Author said, <Q>That it was an casie Way, since it was no more than to seek out where there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Barn, Stable, or Backside, five Persons besides those of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, tho' they spoke never a Word. If you do but swear it <HI>(thus he continued)</HI> to be a Con∣venticle, then it is a Conventicle. It is no Matter if there were ne∣ver a Thought in their Hearts as to Plotting or contriving Insurrecti∣ons (for which the Law was made) they being there, it is sufficient to have them fined Five Shillings a-piece the first Time, and twenty Pounds for the House; and for the second Time ten Shillings a-piece; and if the Justices be not well advised, it may be, for the second Time for the House you may get twenty Pounds more, altho' the Act doth not grant it. And of all this it is said the Thirds is yours: This you may easily have; for the Justices are afraid of your Power, since you have them under your Lee; so they will not much question you, left they be counted Fanaticks; and they know that if they do not please your Wills, your Power is such, that you may recover Fifty Pounds for your Parts, by <HI>Action, Suit, Bill, or Plea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any of his Majesty's Courts at</HI> Westminster, <HI>wherein no Essoign, Protection, or Wager of Law shall lie.</HI> Can your Hearts desire more? Who will not be Informers? that must have all Clauses construed most largely and beneficially to their Justification and Encouragement!</Q></P>
<P>As to the Profitableness, the Author said, <Q>Besides the twenty Pounds and ten Shillings a-piece for meeting, if you can but tempt any by your Questions, or other Provocations, to speak but a Word to answer you, it will serve to make him a Preacher, and then for the first Time here is twenty Pounds, and for the second forty Pounds: It's no Matter what is spoke, or to what Concern; if you swear you did hear such an one speak, it's enough to make him a Preacher. And as to the in∣ability, there is no Danger that you should fall short of your Salary; for you can by your Power make void that old Proveth, <HI>Where it is not to be had, the King must lose his Right.</HI> But your Prerogative is such, that if the Offender hath it not, you can command your Servants to levy it on any other that is not an Offender in that Nature, provided he be there, otherwise an Appeal will be granted.</Q> At this Rate the Author treated the Matter, taking out of the Way all Difficulties and Scruples which any might have objected; and tho he did this mostly in a bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esque Way, yet what he said was to firm and strenuous, that he gave Proofs of being a Man of Understanding, and of a great Wit; for tho' in an ingenious Way he shewed the Abominableness of this in∣forming Trade, yet he proposed it safe every Way; and if any might tell them they were <HI>Knights of the Post;</HI> yet however the Thing fell out, it was never attended with Loss, but always with a certain Gain; since in the Prosecution nothing could be objected, but what might easily be quasht, and the Opposers thus frustrated. <Q>And when to all these infallible Profits was added the Honourableness of the Office, what could one desire more? For was it not honourable indeed, to command both Magistrates and military Officers, to follow the In∣formers where they will? And to obtain this Office, one needed not to be at great Cost to purchase it, nor to break his Pate with studying; since at the very first Conventicle they entred, they might commence

Doctors.</Q> But of what Religion or Profession these Informers should be, the Author himself seemed not to know: <HI>They must be no</HI> Jews, said he; <HI>for these were not to covet their Neighbours Ox, nor Ass, nor any thing that was their Neighbours: Neither should they be</HI> Gentiles, <HI>for they had Conscience accusing, and did by Nature the Things contained in the Law, having the Law writ in their Hearts. And Christians they could be by no Means, for they say they forsake the Devil and all his Works, and all the Lusts of the Flesh, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hurt any by Word nor Deed, which in less than by swearing,</HI> [the common Fact of the Informers.] — To conclude, the Author said, <HI>For any into whose Hands this may come, if they fear any Danger in it, they ought not to conceal it, but to bring it before some Justice, or the Chief Magistrate of the Place, with an Account how they came by it, and then they are innocent: Then if it cannot clear it self, let it lie in Prison till it perish,</HI></P>

And after he had edify'd his Friends there on many Occasions, and ex∣horted them to the maintaining of good Order, both in Things relating in the Church, and in the governing of their Blacks, he now being re∣stor'd to Health again, departed the Island after a Stay of three Months, and set Said for <HI>Jamaica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Afterward sail to <HI>Jamai∣ca.</HI> where <HI>E.

After he had been there about seven Weeks, he performed his Service to his Satisfaction.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1672,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1672</NOTE> he took Shipping for <HI>Maryland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Then take Shipping for <HI>Maryland.</HI> and so travel to <HI>New Eng∣land, Mary∣land</HI> again <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Carolina.</HI></NOTE> where being come, he with those with him travelled thro' Woods and Wildernesses, over Bogs and great Rivers, to <HI>New-England.</HI> By the Way, he had sometimes Opportunity to speak to the <HI>Indians</HI> and their Kings and at other Times he met with singular Cases, all which, for Brevity's Sake, I pass by in Silence. He went also to the Town call'd <HI>Newcastle;</HI> upon <HI>Delaware.</HI> Here he lodg'd at the Governor's House, and had also a Meeting there. From thence he returned again to <HI>Maryland,</HI> and came also into <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> and thus spent above a Year travelling to and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst he was there,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> at War with <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were entred into War against <HI>Holland.</HI> Now tho' I have yet in fresh Remembrance those sad Times, and in what a wonderful Manner it pleas'd the Lord to save our Coun∣try from being quite over-run and subdu'd, yet I shall not mention those Things, since they are at large set down by other Writers.

Wit,</HI> who had been chief Instruments in making the said perpetual E∣dict, and were killed and butchered in a most abominable Manner by the Inhabitants of the <HI>Hague,</HI> was not without good Reason disapproved by many grave and serious People. 'Tis true, it was a great Mistake that they acted so, that they seemed to set Limits to the Almighty; tho' I do not believe their Intent was such, but rather that what they did in making void the Stadholdership, they judged conducive to the Benefit of their Country. After they were murdered, the Widow of <HI>Cornelius <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wit</HI> seemed to have a firm Belief that they were entred into everlasting Glory: For tho' for some Time after their Death she was under a great Concern, considering how on a sudden, and at unawares, they were hur∣ried out of this Life; yet at length, early in the Morning, either in a Dream or in a Vision,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vision of <HI>C. de. Wit</HI>'s Widow</NOTE> she beheld them both in a Cloud in a glorious Form, with Hands lifted up, and cloathed with pure white Raiment. By this Sight all her former Solicitude and Fear was taken from her, and she was fully satisfied concerning their eternal Well-being. I have this Relation from several credible Persons, who said they had it from her own Mouth, 2nd they all agreed in the material Circumstances.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the penal Laws for Re∣ligion suspen∣ded.</NOTE> where it was observed that Persecution for Religion, du∣ring the War, could not but be prejudicial to the Publick, the King gave forth a Declaration, whereby the Execution of the penal Laws was sus∣pended. But since the <HI>Papists,</HI> against whom the most of these Laws had been made, thus got Liberty to enter into Offices of Trust, many of the People grew jealous on this Account; insomuch that the Parliament, in the Year 1673, shewed their Dislike of this to the King, telling him, <HI>That the penal Statutes about ecclesiastical Matters could not be suspended but by an Act of Parliament.</HI> The King wanting Money to continue the War, yield∣ed somewhat to the Parliament, in respect to the <HI>Popish</HI> Priests and Jesu∣its, consenting that the Laws against them should continue in Force.</P>

Thus <HI>Halhead</HI> ended his Speech, and <HI>Lambert,</HI> who had heard him with good Satisfaction, desired him to sit down, which <HI>Halhead</HI> did; and then <HI>Lambert</HI> called for Beer, and gave him to drink; after which he said to him, <HI>Friend, I do believe thou speakest to me in Love, and so I take it.</HI> And then he asked him, <HI>if be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n as at</HI> Dunbar <HI>Fight?</HI> To which <HI>Halhead</HI> having answered, <HI>No;</HI> he further ask'd, <HI>How do you know what great Danger we were in at that Time?</HI> Upon which <HI>Halhead</HI> gave him to understand, <HI>That he coming that Way a little Time after the Fight, and having viewed the Town of</HI> Dunbar, <HI>and the Ground about it where the</HI> English <HI>Army lay, how the Sea was on the one Hand of them, and Hills and Mountains on the other, and the great</HI> Scotch <HI>Army before and behind them, he then took into serious Consideration the great Danger the</HI> English <HI>had been in, and thought how greatly the</HI> Englishmen <HI>were engaged to the Lord for their Deliverance to serve him in Truth and Ʋprightness of Heart all the Days of their Life. Truly</HI> John, said <HI>Halhead</HI> then to <HI>Lambert, I never saw thy Face before to know thee, altho' I have been brought before many of our</HI> English <HI>Commanders in the Time of</HI> Oliver Cromwel. <HI>Lambert</HI> then ask∣ing, <HI>Who they were? Halhead</HI> named the Generals <HI>Fleetwood</HI> and <HI>Desborough,</HI> Major <HI>Blackmore,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Fenwick,</HI> before whom he had been when he was Governour of <HI>Edenburgh. Lambert</HI> then said, <HI>He knew the most of those Men to have been very moderate, and that they ever were against Perse∣cution.</HI> To which <HI>Myles</HI> replied, <HI>Indeed they were very moderate, and would not be much seen to persecute, or be severe with the Lord's People; but truly they permitted others to do it, and took little Notice of the Sufferings of the People of God; so that none were found to plead our Cause, but the Lord God.</HI> To this <HI>Lambert</HI> said, <HI>Altho you and your Friends suffered Persecution, and some Hardships in that Time, your Cause therein is never the worse for that. That is very true,</HI> return'd <HI>Myles, but let me tell th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the Plainness of my Heart, that's no Thanks to you, but Glory to the Lord for ever.</HI> About two Hours <HI>Myles</HI> discoursed with <HI>Lambert</HI> and his Wife and two Daughters, and after he had cleared himself, he took Leave of them, and so parted in Love.</P>
<P>Now before I leave <HI>Halhead,</HI> I'll insert here a Copy of a Letter he writ in the Year 1674, to <HI>G. F.</HI> who was then Prisoner in <HI>Worcester</HI>-Jail. The said Letter was thus;</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In the Month called <HI>January,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> and <HI>T. Lower</HI> brought be∣fore Court at their Sessi∣ons at <HI>Wor∣cester.</HI></NOTE> 1673-4, <HI>G. F.</HI> and <HI>Thomas Lower,</HI> were brought to their Trial in the Court at <HI>Worcester,</HI> it being the last Day of the Sessions; and when they came in, those on the Bench were struck with Paleness in their Faces, and continued a while speechless, insomuch that a Butcher in the Hall said, <HI>What! are they afraid? Dare not the Justi∣ces speak to them?</HI> At length Justice <HI>Parker,</HI> by whose Order <HI>G. F</HI> and <HI>T. Lower</HI> had been committed, made a long Speech, much to the same Effect as the Contents of the Mittimus, and added, <HI>That he thought it a milder Course to send them two to Jail, than to put his Neighbours to the Loss of two hundred Pounds, which they must have suffered, if he had put the Law in Execution against Conventicles.</HI> But this was a very poor Shift, and silly Evasion; for there being no Meeting when he came, nor any to inform, he had no Evidence to convict them, or his Neighbours by. When <HI>Parker</HI> had ended his Speech, the Justices spoke to the Prisoners, and began with <HI>Lower,</HI> whom they examined why he came into that Country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And exa∣min'd.</NOTE> And when they had done with him, they asked of <HI>G. F.</HI> an Account of his Travel, which he gave them, and shewed them clearly, that he and his Friends, of whom so great a Noise had been made by Justice <HI>Parker,</HI> as if many had come together from several Parts, were in a Manner all but one Family. When he had ended speaking, the Chairman <HI>Simpson</HI> said, <HI>Your Relation or Account is very innocent.</HI> Then he and <HI>Parker</HI> having whisper'd a while together, the said Chairman stood up and said, <HI>You Mr.</HI> Fox <HI>are a famous Man; and all this may be true which you have said; but that we may be the better satisfied, will you take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy?</HI> Now, tho' <HI>G. F.</HI> answered to this, <HI>That they had said they would not insnare him, and that this was a plain Snare, since they knew he and his Friends would not take any Oath;</HI> all was in vain, and they caused the Oath to be read; which being done, he told them, <HI>I never took Oath in my Life, but I have always been true to the Government. I was cast into the Dungeon at</HI> Darby, <HI>and kept Prisoner six Months there, because I would not take up Arms against King</HI> Charles <HI>at</HI> Worcester-Fight: <HI>And for going to Meetings, I was carried out of</HI> Leicester, <HI>and brought before</HI> Oliver Cromwel, <HI>as a Plotter to bring in King</HI> Charles: <HI>And ye know in your own Consciences, that we, the People called</HI> Quakers, <HI>cannot take an Oath, or swear in any Case, because Christ hath forbidden it. But as to the Matter or Substance contain'd in the Oaths, this I can say and do, that I do own and acknowledge the King of</HI> England <HI>to be lawful Heir and Successor to the Realm of</HI> England; <HI>and do abhor all Plots and Plotters, and Contrivances against him; and I have
<PB N="496" REF="003104_0507_0FEFD5A32FFF5E68"/>
nothing in my Heart but Love and good Will to him and all Men, and desire his and their Prosperity; the Lord knows it, before whom I stand an innocent Man. And as to the Oath of Supremacy, I deny the Pope and his Power, and abhor it with my Heart.</HI> Whilst he was yet speaking, they cried, <HI>Give him the Book,</HI> viz. the Bible. <HI>The book,</HI> saith <HI>G. F saith, Swear not at all:</HI> And he going on to declare his Mind farther, they cried, <HI>Take him away Jailor;</HI> who not shewing himself very forward, they cry'd again, <HI>Take him away: We shall have a Meeting here; why do you not take him away?</HI> And one of the Bench said, <HI>That Fellow,</HI> meaning the Jailor, <HI>loves to hear him preach.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox</HI> re∣committed for refusing to swear. But <HI>T. Lower</HI> set at Liberty.</NOTE> The Jailor then taking him away, as he was turning from them, he said, <HI>The Lord forgive you who cast me into Prison for obey∣ing the Doctrine of Christ.</HI> After <HI>G. F.</HI> was led away, the Justices told <HI>T. Lower, He was at Liberty;</HI> for they did not think it safe to deal with him at the same Rate as they did with <HI>G. F.</HI> because they thought he had some Protection at Court.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And then pleads ear∣nestly to obtain his Father-in-law's also</NOTE> <HI>Lower</HI> asked then, <HI>Why his Father-in-law might not be set at Liberty, as well as he, since they were both taken together, and their Case was alike?</HI> But they telling him, <HI>they would not hear him,</HI> said, <HI>You may be gone about your Business, for we have nothing more to say to you, seeing you are discharged.</HI></P>
<P>This was all he could get from them; therefore after the Court was risen, he went to speak with them at their Chamber, desiring to know <HI>what Cause they had to detain his Father, seeing they had discharged him;</HI> and wishing them <HI>to consider, whether this was not Partiality,</HI> Upon this <HI>Simp∣son</HI> said, <HI>If you be not content, we will tender you the Oath also, and send you to your Father.</HI> To which <HI>Lower</HI> replied, <HI>Ye may do that, if ye think fit; but whether ye send me or no, I intend to go, and wait upon my Father in Prison; for that is now my Business in this Country.</HI> Then Justice <HI>Parker</HI> said to him, <HI>Do you think, Mr.</HI> Lower, <HI>that I had no Cause to send your Father and you to Prison, when you had such a great Meeting; insomuch that the Parson of the Parish complained to me, that he had lost the greatest Part of his Parishioners; so that when he comes amongst them, he hath scarce any Auditors left?</HI> To this <HI>Lower</HI> returned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Lower</HI> unwillingly gives a smart Reprimand to the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Dr. <HI>Crowder</HI> to the great Diversion of the Justices</NOTE> <HI>I have heard that the</HI> Priest <HI>of that</HI> Parish <HI>comes so seldom to visit his Flock, but once it may be, or twice in a year, to gather up his Tythes, that it was but Charity in my Father, to visit such a forlorn and forsaken Flock. And therefore thou hadst no Cause to send my Father to Prison for visiting them, or for teaching, instructing and directing them to Christ their true Teacher, who had so little Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort or Benefit from their pretended</HI> Pastor, <HI>who comes amongst them only to seek for his Gain from his Quarter.</HI> Up∣on this the Justices fell a laughing; for Dr. <HI>Crowder,</HI> the Priest spoken of, was then in the Room, sitting among them; tho' <HI>Lower</HI> did not know him, and he had the Wit to hold his Tongue, and not to vin∣dicate himself. But after <HI>Lower</HI> was gone away, the Justices so jested on <HI>Crowder,</HI> that he grew ashamed, and was so nettled with it, that he threatned to sue <HI>T. Lower</HI> in the Bishop's Court, upon an Action of De∣famation; which <HI>Lower</HI> having heard of, sent him Word, <HI>That he might begin if he would; and that he would answer him and bring his whole Parish in Evidence against him.</HI> And he told him the same afterwards to his Face; which so cooled the Priest's Eagerness, that he thought it more safe for him to let him alone.</P>
<P>Soon after the Sessions were over, an <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was sent down to <HI>Worcester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> under the Charge of his Son <HI>Low∣er</HI> brought up to the King's Bench Barr, where the Judges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him with mo∣deration</NOTE> for the Sheriff, to bring up <HI>G. Fox</HI> to the King's Bench Bar. Whereupon his Son-in-Law <HI>Lower</HI> conducted him; For the under She∣riff had made <HI>Lower</HI> his Deputy to convey <HI>G. F.</HI> to <HI>London.</HI> Who being arrived there, appeared before the Court of King's Bench, where he found the Judges moderate; and they patiently heard him, when he gave them an Account how he had been stopt in his Journey, and com∣mitted to Jail; and how at his Trial the Oath of Allegiance and Supre∣macy
<PB N="497" REF="003104_0508_0FEFF824EC133FB8"/>
had been tendred to him; and also what he had offered to the Ju∣stices as a Declaration, that he was willing to sign, instead of the said Oaths. To this it was told him by the Chief Justice, <HI>that they would consider farther of it.</HI> Being then delivered to the Keeper of the King's Bench, he was suffered to go and lodge at the House of one of his Friends; for tho' he continued a Prisoner, yet they were sufficiently perswaded that he would not run away.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But thro' the Insinuations of Justice <HI>Parker,</HI> as it was said, and superior Ap∣plication, he is remitted to the next Assi∣zes</NOTE> But after this, Justice <HI>Parker,</HI> as it was said, moved the Court, that <HI>G. F.</HI> might be sent back to <HI>Worcester,</HI> that his Cause might be tried there; for <HI>Parker</HI> saw clearly chat if <HI>G. F.</HI> had been acquitted here, this would have tended to his Shame, for having committed him unjustly.</P>
<P>A Day then being appointed for another Hearing, and <HI>G. F.</HI> appearing again at the King's Bench, and hearing that it was under Deliberation to send him back to <HI>Worcester,</HI> signified that <HI>This was only to ensnare him, by putting the Oath to him, that so they might premunire him, who never took Oath in his Life.</HI> And he farther told them, <HI>If he broke his Yea or Nay, he was content to suffer the same Penalty as those that break their Oaths.</HI> Now seeing <HI>Parker</HI> had spread a Report at <HI>London,</HI> and it had been said in the Parliament-house, <HI>That when he took</HI> G. F. <HI>there were many substantial Men with him, out of several Parts of the Nation, and that they had a Design or Plot in Hand. G. F.</HI> did not omit to shew the Fallacy of that malici∣ous Story. And since he thus said open <HI>Parker</HI>'s Shame, it was not strange that by his Friends at Court he procured that the King's Judges complied with his Desire that <HI>G. F.</HI> should be remanded to <HI>Worcester</HI>-Jail; insomuch that whatever he said, he could not prevent it; only this Favour was granted him, that he might go his own Way, and at his Leisure, provided he would be there without Fail by the Assizes, which were to begin on the second Day of the Month called <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. F.</HI> then after some Stay went down leisurely;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where he ap∣pears accord∣ingly before Judge <HI>Turn∣er,</HI> who tho' seeming incli∣nable to more Kindness, at last refers him to the next Sessions.</NOTE> and being come to <HI>Worcester,</HI> he was on the second Day of the aforesaid Month brought from the Jail to an Inn, near the Sessions-Hall; but not being called that Day, the Jailor came to him at Night, and told him he might go home, meaning to the Jail; whereupon he walked thither, being accom∣panied by one of his Friends. Next Day being brought up again, a Boy of about eleven Years old was set to be his Keeper. Having in my Re∣lation of the Proceedings before the King's Bench pass'd by most Part of the the pleading, so I shall do here likewise, to avoid Repetitions of what hath been several Times related already concerning such Kind of Trials; yet I can't pass by in Silence, that after he had given an Account of his Journey before he was taken, he added, <HI>That since his Imprisonment, he had understood, that his Mother, who was an ancient and weak Woman, and had de∣sired to see him before she died, hearing that he was stopt and imprisoned in his Journey, so that he was not likely to come and see her, it struck her so that she di∣ed soon after; which had been very hard to him.</HI> Judge <HI>Turner,</HI> who former∣ly had been severe to him, seemed now (as some thought) inclined to have him set at Liberty, since he saw they had nothing justly against him; but <HI>Parker,</HI> who had committed him, endeavoured to incense the Judge against him; for if he had been released, then he himself must have born the Blame of having committed <HI>G. F.</HI> unjustly; and therefore he told the Judge, <HI>That</HI> G. F. <HI>was a Ring-leader, that many of the Nation fol∣lowed him; and one knew not what it might come to.</HI> Yet the Judge gave but little ear to all this, being willing to be easy; but he could not resolve to do this, by setting <HI>G. F.</HI> at Liberty, lest he should displease others; and thus in Conclusion, <HI>G. F.</HI> and his Cause were referred to the Sessions again, and he continued Prisoner, but with this Proviso, that he should have the Liberty of the Town; which accordingly he had, and by this he got Opportunity to speak with many Persons, and sometimes
<PB N="498" REF="003104_0509_0FEFD5A4DE323D68"/>
with Priests too, one of which ask'd him, <HI>Whether he was grown up to Perfection?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Priest puts several Questions to <HI>G. F.</HI> which he answers.</NOTE> To which he answered, <HI>What he was, he was by the Grace of God. This is</HI> replied the Priest, <HI>a modest and civil Answer. But,</HI> conti∣nued he in the Words of the Apostle <HI>John, If we say that we have no Sin we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us.</HI> And asking, <HI>What he said to that? G. F.</HI> returned with the Words of the same Apostle, <HI>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a Liar, and his Word is not in us.</HI> Moreover he said, <HI>Christ came to destroy Sin, and to take away Sin. There is a Time for People to see that they have sinned, and there is a Time for them to confess their Sin, and to forsake it, and to know the Blood of Christ to cleanse from all Sin.</HI> After some more reasoning, the Priest said, <HI>We must always be striving:</HI> To which <HI>G. F.</HI> returned, <HI>That it was a sad and comfortless Sort of striving, to strive with a Belief that we should never overcome:</HI> And he told him also, <HI>That</HI> Paul, <HI>who once cried out because of the Body of Death, did also thank God, who gave him the Victory; and that he said,</HI> There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: <HI>So that there was a Time of crying out for Want of Victory, and a Time praising God for the Victory.</HI> But, said the Priest, <HI>Job was not perfect.</HI> To which <HI>G. F.</HI> returned that God hath signified in Scripture, <HI>That</HI> Job <HI>was perfect and upright, and that he eschewed Evil; and that the Devil himself was forced to confess, that God had set an Hedge about him; which was not an outward Hedge, but the invisible heavenly Power. Yet said</HI> Job, replied the Priest, <HI>He chargeth his Angels with Folly, and the Heavens are not clean in his Sight. That's a Mistake,</HI> said <HI>G. F. for it was not</HI> Job <HI>said so, but</HI> Eliphaz <HI>who contended against</HI> Job. <HI>Well but,</HI> said the Priest, <HI>What say you to that Scripture,</HI> The justest Man that is, sinneth seven Times a Day? <HI>There is</HI> answered <HI>G. F. no such Scripture.</HI> So the Priest was silent, and this Con∣ference broken off, of which I have related thus much, to shew that <HI>G. F.</HI> was not such a simple Person, as some from meer Envy have re∣presented him; for he was never at a Loss for an Answer, but had it always in Readiness.</P>
<P>Now the Time of the Sessions being come again,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> appears again at the Sessions.</NOTE> where the Justice, who was Chairman, was one <HI>Street. G. F.</HI> was called there before the Justices, and then the said Justice exceedingly misrepresented the Case, by telling the People, <HI>That</HI> G. F. <HI>had a Meeting at</HI> Tredington <HI>from all Parts of the Nation, to the terrifying of the King's Subjects; for which he had been committed, and that for the Trial of his Fidelity, the Oaths had been ten∣dered to him.</HI> And then turning to <HI>G. F.</HI> he askt him, <HI>Since he had time to consider of it, whether he would now take the Oaths? G. F.</HI> having obtain∣ed Liberty to speak for himself, gave a Relation of his Journey, and shewed that he and his Friends had in no wise kept a Meeting that occa∣sioned Terror to any of the King's Subjects; and as to the Oaths, he shewed why he could not take them, and what he could declare in∣stead thereof. But notwithstanding all this, the Oaths were read to him again; and he persisting in his Refusal to take them, the Indict∣ment was read also; and afterwards the Chairman asked him. <HI>If he was guilty? G. F.</HI> answered, <HI>No, since the Indictment was a Bundle of Lies,</HI> which he proved in several Particulars, asking him, <HI>If he did not know in his Conscience that they were Lies?</HI> To which he said, <HI>It was their Form:</HI> Whereupon <HI>G. F.</HI> returned, <HI>It was not a true Form.</HI> Then the Chairman told the Jury, what they should do in this Case; and before they gave in their Verdict, <HI>G. F.</HI> said to them, <HI>That it was for Christ's-Sake, and in Obedience to his and his Apostle's Command that he could not swear: And therefore</HI> (said he) <HI>take heed what ye do; for before his Judgment-Seat ye shall all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brought.</HI> The Chairman then said, <HI>This is canting.</HI> Why said <HI>G.

among you. Yet ye shall see that I am a Christian, and shall shew forth Chri∣stianity; and my Innocency shall be manifest.</HI> By this his speaking, the Peo∣ple generally were affected; but the Jury however found the Bill against him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill found against him which be tra∣verses, refuses to put in Bail, and warns his Friends not to be bound for him.</NOTE> which <HI>G.

<P>This Letter was sufficient Warrant for the Jailor to permit <HI>G. Fox</HI> to be brought from Prison to the House of one of his Friends.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M. Fox</HI> ac∣quaints the King with her Husband's Condition, &amp; he refers her to Chancellor <HI>Finch.</HI></NOTE> His Wife was come to him before that Time, and after having been with him about seventeen Weeks, and no Discharge like to be obtained for him, she went up to <HI>London,</HI> and being come to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and meet∣ing with the King there, she gave him an Account of her Husband's long Imprisonment, and how weak he was, and not without Danger of his Life. To which the King said, <HI>He could do nothing in it, but she must go to the Chancellor.</HI> And so she went to the Lord <HI>Finch,</HI> who was then Chancellor, and having given him an Account of the Mat∣ter, she told him, <Q>That the King had left it wholly to him; and if he did not shew Pity, and release her Husband out of Prison, she feared he would end his Days there.</Q> But the Chancellor said to her,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> not free to accept of a Pardon.</NOTE> <HI>That the King could not release him otherwise than by a Pardon.</HI> Now <HI>G. F.</HI> could not resolve to be freed thus, as well knowing he had done no Evil; and therefore he would rather have lain in Prison all his Days, than to be thus set at Liberty; otherwise he needed not to have lain so long, since the King had been willing long before to have gi∣ven him a Pardon, and also had said to one <HI>Thomas More,</HI> <Q>That <HI>G. F.</HI> needed not scruple being released by a Pardon; for many a Man, that was as innocent as a Child, had had a Pardon granted him.</Q> <HI>G. F.</HI> unwilling to have a Pardon, but desiring to have the Validity of his Indictment tried before the Judges, the Lord Chancellor, who shewed himself a discreet Man, procured that an <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was <PB N="501" REF="003104_0512_0FEFF828E77793A0"/>

F.</HI> an <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> in or∣der to try the Validity of his Indictment.</NOTE> The <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was with the first Opportunity sent down by his Wife to <HI>Worcester;</HI> but there they would not part with him at first, (being now recovered a little of his Sickness) under a Pretence that he was premunired, and was not to go out in that Manner. Thus it became necessary to send to <HI>London</HI> again; and another Order was got and sent down to bring up <HI>G. F.</HI> before the King's Bench. Being still weak, he was carried up to <HI>London</HI> in a Coach, the Under-Sheriff and the Clerk of the Peace accompanying him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A second Or∣der sent to bring him up.

And since it appeared that <HI>Corbet</HI> was in the right, they chose to let their Plea fall, perhaps for Fear of worse Consequence. And thus they began to examine the Errors of the Indictment, which proved to be so many and so gross, that all the Judges were of Opinion, <HI>That the Indictment was quash'd and void, and that</HI> G.

<P>The Year was now come to an End. But before I go over to the next, I am to mention that the <HI>Baptists</HI> in <HI>England</HI> losing from Time to Time some of their best Members, writ therefore very fiercely against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> endeavouring thereby to render them no Christians. But those Writings were continually answered, and that with so many con∣vincing Reasons, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> got more Adherents by it. The Consequence of this was, that a publick Dispute was appointed to be held between the <HI>Baptists</HI> and the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the Meeting-house of the <HI>Baptists</HI> at <HI>London.</HI> For the <HI>Quakers</HI> there spoke by Turns; <HI>George White∣head, Stephen Crisp, William Penn,</HI> and <HI>George Keith;</HI> and the Opponents were <HI>Jeremy Ives, William Kiffin, Thomas Plant, Tho.

<P>Not long after he writ a smart Letter from the Prison to two of his Society (who having been imprisoned with him for the same Cause, had taken the Oath, thereby to obtain their Liberty) wherein he reproved them for their falling away,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J.

Neither did he stop here; for 'tis plain that he was now departed from his Profession. To temporize therefore, and to find out Excuses for what he had done, he put forth a Book in Print, wherein he asserted the Lawfulness of Swearing. It was asked of him, Whether he was that same <HI>Jeremy Ives,</HI> that once had been of such a tender Conscience that he durst not take an Oath, and had afterwards publickly defended Swearing, as lawful? And he did not deny the Fact, for it was notoriously known: But he went about to disguise the Mat∣ter, and said, <HI>I am that</HI> Jeremy <HI>who took the Oath of Allegiance, and writ a Book to prove that some Oaths were lawful, tho' not all.</HI> Neither did he deny the fore-mentioned Letter, for it was extant, and written as fol∣loweth:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Desire to lay before you this my Condition in this my Fall, that my Fall may be no Cause for you to stumble, but that you by it may be the more encouraged to stand; for I have yielded to the Betrayer, and so betrayed the innocent Seed in me; for I forsook the Counsel of the Lord, and consulted with Flesh and Blood, and so I fell into the Snare of the World, and yielded to the Covenant; and so I rested satisfied in what I had done, for some certain Hours; but when the Lord in his Power looked back upon me, then I remem∣bred what I had done; then I remembred that I had denied Truth, which once I had profess'd, tho' once I thought I should have stood when others fell. So the Terrors of the Lord have taken hold on me, and I lie under the Judgments of the Lord.</P>
<P>And now I feel the Truth of the Words that were spoke by Christ, <HI>That he that faileth in one Tittle, is guilty of all;</HI> and now I feel the Truth of that, <HI>That it is better to forsake Wife and Children, and all a Man hath, even Life it self, for Christ and the Truth-sake, than to break one Tittle of the Law of God written in the Heart.</HI> So I hope that by Mercy and Judgment the Lord will redeem me to himself again. The Lord may suffer some to fall, that the standing of them that stand faithful may seem to be the more glorious, and for them to take heed lest they fall.</P>
<P>Now I know and feel, that it is better to part with any Thing of

</LETTER>
<P>It is remarkable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An instructive Digression on this Occasion.</NOTE> that this <HI>Chilton</HI> in the Conclusion of his Letter saith, That <HI>His Bonds were greater than those of his Friends,</HI> who neither feared a <HI>Praemunire,</HI> nor Loss of their Liberty, when they must pay so dear for it, as the taking of an Oath. For when any one truly abides in the Fear of God, he dares not against the Convictions of his Conscience trans∣gress the Divine Commandments, and seek Evasions to avoid the Stress thereof: For certainly God will not be mocked. Could our Saviour have spoken in more plain and express Terms than he did, when he said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. v. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Swear not at all?</HI> And yet what cunning Devices have been invent∣ed by those who boast of the Name of Christians, to enervate the Force of these express Words. It is not a proper Place here to refute their Reasons; but yet I can't think it unsuitable to shew briefly how dange∣rous it is to act against the express Commandments of Sacred Writ, and against the Conviction of one's Conscience, thereby to avoid Persecution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">James ii. 10.</NOTE> For not only the Apostle <HI>James</HI> saith, <HI>Whosoever shall offend in one Point, he is guilty of all;</HI> but our supreme Lawgiver Christ himself saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. x. 33.</NOTE> <HI>Whosoever shall deny me before Men, him will I also deny before my Fa∣ther which is in Heaven.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark viii. 38.</NOTE> And <HI>whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my Words, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father, with the holy Angels.</HI> And to encourage us to Faithful∣ness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. x. 28.</NOTE> he hath also said, <HI>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</HI> Which Words indeed are so emphatical, that it ought not to displease any that I repeat them, as they have been left on Re∣cord by the Evangelist <HI>Luke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xii. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> thus, <HI>I say unto you my Friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed, hath Power to cast into Hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</HI> Can it be otherwise, but that such Words must needs make a powerful Im∣pression on a real Christian; And the more when we consider, that nothing in the World can retrieve or restore a perishing Soul, as may appear from these Words of our blessed Saviour, <HI>What is a Man profit∣ed if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Or what shall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> A clear Proof that the whole World, and all that is contained therein, is not able to save one Soul, or to af∣ford any Thing that can redeem it. If I here thought it requisite, a godly Zeal at present would make me say more on this Subject; but not to exspatiate too far beyond the Limits of this Historical Tract, I shall not pursue this Digression any farther, but return to my Relation from whence I thus stept aside.</P>
<P>To take up again then the broken Thread of my Discourse, I once more come to <HI>Jeremy Ives,</HI> who, to avoid Persecution, had taken the Oath contrary to his Understanding;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Rudyard</HI>'s Reproof to <HI>J. Ives,</HI> with his Answer.</NOTE> and it was <HI>Thomas Rudyard,</HI> men∣tioned here before, who objected this to him: And he feeling himself pinched by it, endeavoured to break the Stress thereof by saying, That <Q>the Reason why in a Letter he had blamed a Friend, was for his saying he had rather have given fifty Pounds than have took the Oath of Allegiance, and yet swore he took it freely and willingly.</Q> But who sees not what a poor Shift this was?</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="003104_0516_0FEFF83004049850"/>Now to come to the Dispute; I already mentioned, it was asserted, <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>were no Christians;</HI> and to maintain this, <HI>Thomas Hicks</HI> said, <HI>They that deny the Lord's Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A summary Account of the Dispute at <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bican</HI> with the <HI>Bap∣tists.</HI></NOTE> <HI>are no Christians: But the</HI> Quakers <HI>deny the Lord's Christ,</HI> &amp;c. To this <HI>W. Penn</HI> said <HI>I deny the</HI> Minor, viz. <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>deny the Lord's Christ.</HI> And <HI>T. Hicks</HI> returned, <HI>They that deny Christ to be a distinct Person without them, deny the Lord's Christ: But the</HI> Quakers <HI>deny Christ to be a distinct Person without them: Therefore,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>W. Penn</HI> then desired that <HI>T. Hicks</HI> would explain what he meant by the Term <HI>Person.</HI> And <HI>T. Hicks</HI> answered, <HI>I mean the Man Christ Jesus.</HI> To which <HI>W. Penn</HI> replied, <HI>Then I deny the Minor,</HI> viz. <HI>That we deny the Man Christ Jesus.</HI> To which <HI>Hicks</HI> returned, <HI>I prove ye deny the Man Christ Jesus:</HI> One of your own Writers saith, <HI>That Christ was never seen with carnal Eyes, nor heard with carnal Ears,</HI> &amp;c. To this <HI>J. Ives</HI> added: <HI>He that denies that Christ was ever seen with carnal Eyes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>denies the Man Christ: But the</HI> Quakers <HI>deny that Christ was ever seen with carnal Eyes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>George Keith</HI> then said, <HI>I answer by distinguishing: Christ as God was never seen with carnal Eyes; but as Man he was seen with carnal Eyes.</HI> To this <HI>J. Ives</HI> returned: <HI>But he was Christ as he was Man: How then was not Christ seen with carnal Eyes?</HI> This Question <HI>G. Keith</HI> answered thus: <HI>We are to consider that the Terms or Names Jesus Christ, are sometimes applied to him as God, and sometimes to him as Man; yea sometimes to the very Body of Jesus: But the Question is, whether do those Names more properly, immediately, and originally belong to him as God, or as he was before he took the Manhood upon him, or to the Manhood? We affirm, those Names are given to him most pro∣perly and eminently as God; and less properly, yet truly, as Man; and least pro∣perly to his Body, yea to his dead Body.</HI> Then <HI>J. Ives</HI> askt, <HI>Where do you read that the Carcass was called the Christ?</HI> This irreverend Expression so dis∣pleased many, that some; cried out, <HI>Where didst thou ever read that Christ's dead Body was called a Carcass?</HI> From this Disgust <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>I beseech you for the Lord's-sake, that we may treat of these Things as becomes Christians. G. Keith</HI> then resuming the Discourse, answered <HI>J. Ives</HI>'s Question thus: <HI>I prove that the dead Body of Jesus was called</HI> Christ <HI>from the Words of</HI> Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. xx. 15. Matt. xxviii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Where have ye laid him?</HI> For she had just before called the Body <HI>her Lord:</HI> Likewise the Angel said to her, <HI>See the Place where the Lord lay:</HI> And that he was Jesus Christ before he took Flesh, I prove from the Saying of the Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. iii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Who created all Things by Jesus Christ.</HI> Then <HI>T. Hicks</HI> said, <HI>I will prove the</HI> Quakers <HI>to be no Christians:</HI> And <HI>J. Ives</HI> aded, <HI>They that say Christ cannot be seen with carnal Eyes, and was never visible to wicked Men, do deny the Lord's Christ; for he was seen with carnal Eyes, and by wicked Men.</HI> To this <HI>W. Penn</HI> said, <HI>I distinguish upon the Word seen; wicked Men might see him in that bodily Appearance, and yet not see him to be the Christ of God; they saw his Manhood, but not his Christship: This I will prove from Christ's Words to</HI> Peter, <HI>when he confessed him to be Christ, the Son of the living God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. xvi. 16, 17.</NOTE> viz. <HI>Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven:</HI> Therefore <HI>Peter</HI> with a carnal Eye could not have seen the Lord's Christ, much less wicked Men. My second Proof is from the Apostle's Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. ii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Whom none of the Princes of this World knew; for had they known him, they would not have crucified him. W. Penn</HI> enlarging a little more on this Subject, said also, <HI>That</HI> seeing <HI>and</HI> know∣ing <HI>in Scripture are sometimes equivalent.</HI> And <HI>G. Keith</HI> added, <HI>Christ said,</HI> He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father: <HI>But no wicked Man hath seen the Father, therefore no wicked Man hath seen Christ, as such. Ives</HI> and his Companions scoft at this Distinction: But the <HI>Quakers</HI> averred, <HI>That all who saw Jesus as the Carpenter's Son, did not see him as the Christ of God.</HI> Then <HI>Ives</HI> askt, <HI>Is the Manhood a Part of the Lord's Christ?</HI> To which <HI>W. Penn</HI> returned, <HI>Is this to prove the Charge of our denying the Lord's Christ? It

seems we must be here to be catechised, and ye will not answer us one Question, yet I shall answer</HI> J. Ives <HI>his Question, if he will promise to answer mine. Ives</HI> then saying that he would answer it, <HI>W. Penn</HI> returned, <HI>I here declare that we do faithfully believe that holy Manhood to be a Member of the Christ of God:</HI> And directing his Question to <HI>Ives,</HI> he said, <HI>Was he the Christ of God before he was manifest in the Flesh? He was,</HI> answered <HI>Ives, the Son of God. But,</HI> replied <HI>W. Penn, was be the Lord's Christ? I will prove him to have been the Lord's Christ as well before as after: First from the Apostle</HI> Paul<HI>'s Words to the</HI> Corinthians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. x. 4.</NOTE> That Rock was Christ: <HI>Next from</HI> Jude, <HI>where some</HI> Greek <HI>Copies have it thus,</HI> That Jesus brought the People of <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Egypt.</HI> But to this <HI>Ives</HI> gave no Answer, how often soe∣ver he was called upon for it. And this was no great Wonder, since it was well known that there were such among the <HI>Baptists</HI> who fa∣voured the <HI>Socinian</HI> Principles. But <HI>Ives,</HI> that he might not appear altogether mute, came on again with a Question, viz. <HI>Do ye believe that Christ in his human Nature is in Heaven?</HI> This made <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> say to the Auditory, <HI>Ye have heard the Charge against us, and the Distinction that hath been made between</HI> Seeing <HI>and</HI> Seeing <HI>of</HI> Christ, <HI>as namely between the spiritual saving Sight of the Lord's Christ, and the Seeing of his outward Man, Person, or Body. In this last Sense it could never be intended that it was not visible to the outward Eye; but it was the spiritual Rock which all</HI> Is∣rael <HI>drank of, and as he was before</HI> Abraham <HI>was, and as glorified with the Father before the World began; and as Christ himself said to</HI> Philip, He that seeth me, seeth my Father also: <HI>And only Saints, or Children of Light, could truly say,</HI> We have seen his Glory as the only Begotten of the Fa∣ther, full of Grace and Truth. <HI>In all which Considerations, or Senses of Seeing, the Lord's Christ was only seen spiritually, and not with carnal Eyes.</HI> This <HI>Ives</HI> granted that so it might be left: Yet presently after, instead of proving the <HI>Quakers</HI> no Christians, he askt again, <HI>Do ye believe or own that Christ is in Heaven with his humane Nature?</HI> To which <HI>W. Penn</HI> answered, <HI>We do believe the Man Christ Jesus to be glorified in Heaven.</HI> Which Answer <HI>Ives</HI> refusing to accept, because it was not in the Terms of his Question, <HI>Penn</HI> askt, <HI>What Difference dost thou make between the Man∣hood and humane Nature of Christ? None,</HI> returned <HI>Ives, if you mean candid∣ly.</HI> To which <HI>Penn</HI> replied, <HI>I do mean and speak candidly; we do believe that holy Manhood to be in heavenly Glory.</HI> Now since it began to grow dark, the <HI>Baptists</HI> desired to leave off, and to resume the Matter at ano∣ther Time; as was done also: But the Parties did not agree for all that; for tho' the <HI>Baptists</HI> continued to assert that the <HI>Quakers</HI> were no Chri∣stians, yet these had abundance of Reasons to maintain the contrary; and this they did so effectually, that those of the other Party, under a Pretence of the Meeting-Place's being overcharged with People, and that the Gallery gave Way, broke up the Meeting, without a final Conclusion.</P>
<P>Persecution in this Year was not very sharp at <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Persecution continues.</NOTE> but for all that, active in other Places, so that I do not want Matter to make a Relation of it: But to shun Prolixity, I'll mention but one Case.</P>

At this Invitation some came to his House, yet not above the Number of Fourteen Persons; and two Informers went and acquainted a Justice of the Peace thereof, who recorded this small Assembly as a seditious Meeting, and fined tne sick Man twenty Pounds for this pre∣tended Transgression; and so his Goods were seized, and six Cows ta∣ken from him. And one <HI>Robert Smith,</HI> being overheard by the Inform∣ers to have spoken five or six Words, was fined also twenty Pounds as

Being there, he un∣derstood that four young Students at <HI>Aberdeen</HI> were convinced at a Dispute held by <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> and <HI>George Keith,</HI> with some of the Scho∣lars of that University.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four young Students of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> convinced.</NOTE> And being visited by some of the Neighbour∣hood, among others came also to him Colonel <HI>Kirby,</HI> his old Persecu∣tor, who now carried himself very lovingly, and bid him welcome in∣to the Country. Yet notwithstanding this Appearance of Kindness, some Time afterwards he ordered the Constables of <HI>Ʋlverstone</HI> to tell <HI>G. F.</HI> <Q>That they must have no more Meetings at <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> for if they had, they were commanded by him to break them up; and they were to come the next <HI>Sunday</HI> after.</Q> But this Threatning did not make <HI>G. F.</HI> afraid; for he, with his Friends, had a Meeting on that First-day of the Week, and none came to disturb them. During his Abode at home, when he did not travel to and fro in the Country, as he used to do, to edify his Friends by his Ministry, he supplied this with his Pen, and exhorted them by Writing, where he could not do it by Word of Mouth: Besides he writ other serviceable Trea∣tises, for he was a diligent Man.</P>
<P>In the mean while Persecution for the Worship of God did not cease altogether: The Act against seditious Conventicles gave Opportunity to the Malicious to disturb the religious Meetings of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who never met in a clandestine Manner, but always publickly; and on this Account Fines were extorted from them; to which may be added, that oftentimes they were still very ill treated, and most grievously abused, as among the rest at <HI>Long Claxton</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelties exercised at <HI>Long Clax∣ton</HI> in <HI>Lei∣cestershire.</HI></NOTE> where some Women were dragg'd by the Neck along the Street; and among these a Widow, the Skin of whose Neck was rubbed off by this Rudeness; and an an∣cient Woman, above seventy, was violently cast down to the Ground: Some of the Men were dragged by the Hair, and others by their Legs, besides the many Blows given them, and some were trodden upon till the Blood gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out of their Mouth and Nose. Yet all this they bore pa∣tiently, without making any Resistance; whereby it happened sometimes that some who had not the Gift of Preaching, teached others by their patient Suffering, shewing by their meek Behaviour, that their Works did agree with their Christian Profession: And tho' many were rob∣bed of all they had, even Clothes and Beds not excepted, yet they continued stedfast, without fainting; tho' often it was called a Meet∣ing when some were come together, not properly to perform religious Worship, as hath been related already, and also happened:</P>

who sent three of his Servants to take Inspection of the said Meeting; and tho' these looking into the Book in which the charitable Distri∣butions were entred, found that this Meeting had been only to consi∣der of the Necessities of the Poor, yet several were fined, and <HI>Penford</HI> himself twenty Pounds for his House, and ten Pounds for the Preach∣er, when there was never an one there; but they having heard him speak, this was counted sufficient to make him pass for a Preacher. Now tho' he and <HI>Richard Woodland</HI> appealed for Justice, yet the Court positively denyed their Appeal, unless they would first take the Oath of Allegiance. This was the old Snare, so that the Hearing of the Matter was denied, and treble Damage given against them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lewes</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Snat</HI> Priest at <HI>Lew∣es</HI> gives false Information, so his Kins∣man <HI>J.

<P>In <HI>Norfolk</HI> the Rage of the Persecutors was such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Norfolk</HI> some berea∣ved of all, in particular <HI>J.

Thus this deceased Wo∣man was no more suffered to lye quiet in her Grave than in her sick Bed, where the Day before her Death she had been threatned, by Or∣der of one <HI>Christopher Bedingfield,</HI> to have her Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken from under her while living. Now the Reason of this taking up of the Corps was, that tho' her Husband was one of those call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet she not being properly a Member of that Society, it was taken ill that she had been buried in a plain Way, without paying to the Priest his pretended Due for the ordinary Service over the Dead.</P>
<P>In <HI>Somersetshire</HI> thirty two Persons were fined for having been at a Burial: The like happened in the County of <HI>Derby,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In <HI>Somerset∣shire</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for being at a Burial.

Of this the Priest <HI>John Wilson</HI> was Informer to the Justice of Peace <HI>John Loe,</HI> and out of the House of the said <HI>Samuel Roe</HI> was taken the Value of thirty Pounds; so that the Share of the Informer was no less than ten Pounds, since according to Law his Due was a Third of the Spoil. I could here relate several Instances of great Adversities and and sad Mischiefs that befel cruel Persecutors: But not to exspatiate too far, I have silent∣ly passed by many remarkable Cases.</P>
<P>Yet in general Terms I may say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sad Stai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Persecutors.</NOTE> that many of the Persecutors, both Justices, Informers, and others, came to a miserable End, some being by sudden or unnatural Death, and others by lingring Sicknesses or Dis∣tempers, or by foul and stinking Diseases taken out of this Life: wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st some, who by Spoil had scraped much together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to great Poverty and Beggary, whole Names I could let down, and mention also Time and Place, and among these some rapacious Ecclesiasticks, who came to a sad End; but I studiously omit particularizing such Instances, to

But none of the Persecutors seem'd to take Notice, or to regard such Instances; for they let their Rage loose against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who for all that continued in Patience, tho' they did not think it unlawful to give Notice of the grievous Oppres∣sion their Friends suffered, to those that were in Authority, lest they might have excused themselves as ignorant of these violent Proceed∣ings. Therefore it was not omitted to give forth in publick Print, ma∣ny of those crying Instances that have been related here, and to pre∣sent them to the King and Parliament, with humble Addresses to that Purpose. But all this found but small Entrance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Glory of re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning from Persecution reserved to <HI>K.

<P>This Year deceased at Sea <HI>William Bayly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the Death of <HI>W.

And being afterwards entered into Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, he became a zealous Preach∣er among them. When in this his last Voyage he was grown sick, and felt Death approaching, he bid <HI>John Clark,</HI> Master of the said Vessel, remember him to his dear Wife and little Ones, and also to <HI>G. Fox, G. Whitehead,</HI> and others; and being filled with Joy, began to sing, say∣ing, <HI>The creating Word of the Lord endures for ever.</HI> He took several that were about him by the Hand, and exhorted them <HI>to fear the Lord, and not to fear Death: Death,</HI> said he, <HI>is nothing in it self; for the Sting of Death is Sin. Tell the Friends at</HI> London, <HI>that would have been glad to have seen my Face, I go to my Father and their Father, to my God and their God. Remember my Love to my dear Wife; she will be a sorrowful Widow: But let her not mourn too much, for it's well with me.</HI> And having spo∣ken something concerning his outward Business to the Master, he said in Regard of his Wife and Children, <Q>I have left them no Portions, but my Endeavour hath been to make God their Father. Shall I lay down my Head upon the Waters? Well, God is the God of the whole Universe; and tho, my Body sink, I shall swim a top of the Wa∣ters.</Q> Then taking his Leave of the Company, he said, <HI>I see not one of you, but I wish you all well.</HI> And one asking, <HI>How it was with him?</HI> He answered, <HI>I am perfectly well.</HI> After having spoken many more sensible Words, about four in the Morning he departed quietly, as if he had fallen asleep. His Wife <HI>Mary,</HI> the same that had formerly been at <HI>Adri∣anople,</HI> and spoken with the Emperor of the <HI>Turks,</HI> gave an excellent Testimony in Writing concerning him; and <HI>John Crook</HI> in a Preface to <HI>William Bayly</HI>'s Works, said of him, (the Truth of which I know by my own Experience) <Q>As he was bold and zealous in his Preaching, being willing to improve his Time, as if he had known it was not to be

Sometimes by cruel Persecutors he hath been thrown down, and dragged upon the Ground by the Hair of his Head, and his Mouth and Jaws endeavoured to be rent and broke asunder, so that the Ground whereon he lay was smeared with his Blood: Yet, as if this butchering had not been enough to make him a fit Sacrifice for the Shambles of their Cruelty, a heavy gross Bodied Persecutor stamped upon his Breast with his Feet, endeavou∣ring to beat the Breath out of his Body: And when this Persecutor had done his Pleasure, he commanded the Jailor to take him away, and put him in some nasty Hole for his Entertainment and Cure. And had not the God of <HI>Israel</HI> been his Physician there, he had been ta∣ken from us long 'ere this.</Q> Thus far <HI>John Crook.</HI></P>

<P>In the Town of <HI>Hereford</HI> the Meetings were also disturbed from Time to Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Hereford</HI> great Mis∣chief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns chiefly by rude Boys in∣couraged by the Mayor. <HI>A.

One of the Leaders of this turbulent Company was the Son of one <HI>Abraham Seward,</HI> who about this Time was elected Mayor; but when Complaints were made to him of the outragious Actions of the said wicked Crew, he pretended to be ignorant of his Son's Doings, and for all that threatned those that came to him, with the Execution of the Law upon them, if they did not leave off to keep Meetings. And as it was well known that the chief Master of the Town-School was displeased at the extravagant Insolency of some of his Scholars, so it was reported also that he was forbidden to correct them for it; and that the College Priests had set them on, and said they would bear them out in what they did: For some of those brutish Boys were Choristers. Two Friends went to the Justices, <HI>Robert Simons</HI> and <HI>Tho∣mas Simons,</HI> to acquaint them with the excessive Abuses they met with. But the Justices not at all regarding their Complaint, the said <HI>Robert</HI> endeavoured to draw some Confession of a Meeting from one of them, intending, as he himself said, immediately to have fined him, if he had confessed; but he was wary. Now since the Insolency of the Boys was thus encouraged by Authority, it was no Wonder it continued there a whole Year. At length eight Men were taken from the Meet∣ing, by the aforesaid Mayor <HI>Abraham Seward,</HI> and carried to the Town-hall; and in their Passage along he said, <HI>They should never meet there more.</HI> To which a Friend going with him, said, <HI>We are a People ga∣thered by the Power of the Lord; and therefore the Power of Man cannot scatter us.</HI> Being come to the Town-hall, the Oaths of Allegiance and Supre∣macy were tendred to them; on which they said, <HI>We are Christians, there∣fore cannot break the Command of Christ, which forbids</HI> to swear at all; <HI>but to render just and lawful Allegiance to the King, we do not deny, nor refuse.</HI> And they persisting in their Refusal to swear, were committed to Prison. The next Day after, one <HI>Walter Rogers,</HI> a Prebend, walking by the Meet∣ing-house, and observing how it was broken, said to some, <HI>That they were very good Boys, and had done their Work better than he thought they had.</HI></P>

they met under a Pretence of Religious Exercise; and seeing there were more than five, and not of</HI> John Sayton<HI>'s Family; therefore it must needs be a Con∣venticle.

<P>Altho' in the Beginning of this Statute the instructing of the Ne∣groes in the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers</HI> is represented as a Thing whereby the Safety of the Island might be much hazarded, yet the Sequel shews that this was not the Matter, but that it was endeavoured to deprive the <HI>Quakers</HI> of their due Liberty.

with <HI>Barclay</HI> concerning the <HI>inward and immediate Revelat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the Spirit of God,</HI> this induced <HI>Barclay</HI> to write a Letter on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Subject in Latin to the afore-mentioned Heer, wherein he made a more large Re∣ply to his Arguments, than he had done by Word of Mouth. This Letter being sent over from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> was delivered by <HI>Benja∣min Furly</HI> at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> to the said Heer <HI>Paets,</HI> with a Desire that he might be pleased to return an Answer to it, which he promised he would. But he continuing deficient in the Case, <HI>Furly</HI> at last publish'd the said Letter in Print, but without mentioning the Name of him to whom 'twas written, only his Character, <HI>viz. Cuidam Legato.</HI> In this Letter was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et down first the Objection of the Heer <HI>Paets,</HI> to wit, <Q>That since the Being and Substance of the Christian Religion consist∣eth in the Knowledge of, and Faith concerning the Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ Jesus, he considered the Substance of the Christian Religion as a contingent Truth; which contingent Truth was Matter of Fact. And Matter of Fact could not be known but by the Relation of another, or by the Perception of the outward Senses; because there are naturally in our Souls no Ideas of contingent Truths, such as are concerning necessary Truths, <HI>viz. That God is, and that the whole is greater than the Part.</HI> And since it might without Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urdity be said, That God cannot make a con∣tingent Truth to become a necessary Truth; neither can God reveal contingent Truths or Matters of Fact, but as contingent Truths are revealed; and Matters of Fact not being revealed but by the outward Senses, the Conclusion drawn from thence is, That Men are not ob∣liged to believe God producing any Revelation in the Soul concern∣ing Matter of Fact, whether of a Thing done or to be done, unless there be added some Miracles obvious to the outward Senses, by which the Soul may be ascertained that that Revelation cometh from God.</Q> All these Arguments <HI>Barclay</HI> answered very circu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stantia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, premising first, <HI>That it was falsly supposed that the Essence of the Cristian Re∣ligion consisted in the Historical Faith and Knowledge of the Birth, Death, Life, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ.</HI> That <HI>Faith and Historical Knowledge is indeed a Part of the Christian Religion, but not such an essential Part, as that without which the Christan Religion cannot conssist, but an integral Part, which goes to the compleating of the Christian Religion, as the Hands or Feet of a Man are integral Parts of a Man, without which nevertheless a Man may exist, but not an entire and compleat Man.</HI> Yet he agrees, <HI>That the Historical Know∣ledge of Christ is commonly manifested to us by the Holy Scripture as the Means;</HI> but nevertheless he asserts, That <HI>God could without such an out∣ward Mean manifest the said Historical Knowledge to our Minds:</HI> And also, That a <HI>contingent Truth may be known by a supernatural Knowledge.</HI> And he saith, That <HI>when God doth make known unto Men any Matter of Fact by divine immediate Revelation, he then speaks as to the Ear of the Heart of the inward Man.</HI> And That <HI>as when any natural Idea is excited in us, we clearly know it; so also when a supernatural Idea is raised, we clearly know That whereof it is the Idea.</HI> He also holds forth, <HI>What properly is the in∣ward supernatural Sense in Man; and then he distinguisheth between contingent and necessary Truths, and shews how a Divine Revelation may be known to be such, saying that natural and spiritual Senses are distinguishable by their Objects, and demonstrating how godly Men may know they are in the Favour of God, and how the Wicked feel the Wrath of God as Fire.</HI> He also relates,<HI>After what Manner the Spiritual Senses distinguish the Good and the Evil; and he confes∣seth there is in all Men, as well the Godly as Ʋngodly, some Sort of Idea of God, as of a most perfect Being:</HI> But he asserts, <HI>That the supernatural Idea of God, differeth much from the natural; and that in all Men there is superna∣tural</HI>
<PB N="517" REF="003104_0528_0FEFF83F2FDDA598"/>
Idea of God. He also shews, <HI>Wherein the Motions of the Mind differ from those of the Body; and that there are Ideas as well of supernatural, as of natural Things.</HI> And shewing from whence the Errors of false Like∣nesses of Reason proceed, he says, <HI>That the natural Reason cannot perceive supernatural Things.</HI> He also asserts, <HI>That the Revelations to the Prophets were by inward Inspirations in their Minds; and that they were most certainly perswaded that they were divinely inspired, even without any outward Miracle. And that it is by the Inspiration of the same Divine Spirit, by which the Pro∣phets prophesied that we do believe their Words and Writings to be divine, con∣cerning contingent Truths, as well past as to come.</HI> Moreover he enquires, <HI>Whether Faith comes by outward Hearing, and he shews how the outward Sen∣ses may be deceived; nay, that often they are vitiated both by outward Casu∣alties and natural Infirmities, whereunto the Godly are no less subject than the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P>All this is treated at large by <HI>Barclay,</HI> as may be seen in the said Letter, and several Years after, when the Heer <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts</HI> was at <HI>London,</HI> being one of the Commissioners for the <HI>Dutch East-India</HI>-Company, <HI>Bar∣clay</HI> spoke with him again, and so represented the Matter, that he rea∣dily yielded, <HI>That he had been mistaken in his Notion of the</HI> Quakers; <HI>for he found they could make a reasonable Plea for the Foundation of their Religion.</HI> And thereupon <HI>R.

<P>Before I proceed to a direct Answer to this Argument, some Things are necessary to be premised:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Christian Religion con∣sist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in the Historical Knowledge of Christ.</NOTE> <HI>First</HI> then; That 'tis falsly supposed, <HI>That the Essence of the Christian Religion consists in the Historical Faith and Knowledge of the Birth, Death, Life, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ.</HI> That Faith and Histo∣rical Knowledge is indeed a Part of the Christian Religion; but not such an Essential Part, as that without which the Christan Religion cannot consist; but an integral Part, which goes to the compleating of the Christian Religion: As the Hands or Feet of a Man are in∣tegral Parts of a Man, without which nevertheless a Man may exist, but not an entire and compleat Man.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Historical Knowledge of Christ is a commonly manifessed to us, but by the Holy Scrip∣ture.</NOTE> <HI>Secondly,</HI> If by <HI>Immediate Revelation</HI> be understood such a <HI>Revelation</HI> of GOD, as begets in our Souls an Historical Faith and Knowledge of the Birth of Christ in the Flesh, without the Means of the Holy Scripture, we do not contend for such a Revelation, as commonly gi∣ven, or to be expected by us, or any other Christians. For albeit many other Evangelical Truths be manifested to us by the immedi∣ate Manifestation of God, not using the Scripture as the Means, yet the Historical Knowledge of Christ is not commonly manifested to us, nor to any others, but by the Holy Scripture, as the Means, and that by Way of a Material Object; Even as when we see the Person of <HI>Peter</HI> or <HI>Paul</HI> to our visive Faculty Immediately, yet not without the <HI>Medium</HI> of that Person concurring as a Material Object to pro∣duce that Sight; while the Light of the Sun concurs, as the formal Object of that Vision or Sight. So that when we livingly and spiri∣tually know the History of the Birth of Christ in the Flesh; the In∣ward
<PB N="519" REF="003104_0530_0FEFF842908F8080"/>
Revelation or Illumination of GOD, which is like the Sun's Light, proceeding from the Divine Sun, doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hine into the Eye of the Mind, and by its Influence moves the Mind to assent unto the <HI>Historical Truth of CHRIST's Birth, Life,</HI> &amp;c. in the reading or hear∣ing the Scripture, or Meditating therein.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">God can manifest the Historical Truth of Christ to our Minds with∣out the Scrip∣ture.</NOTE> Nevertheless we do firmly assert, That GOD can most easily, clearly, and certainly manifest to our Minds the <HI>Histori∣cal Truths of CHRIST's Birth,</HI> &amp;c. when it so pleaseth him, even without the Scripture, or any other outward Means. And because this Argument seems to be formed against the <HI>Possibility</HI> of such a Re∣velation, therefore I shall proceed to discuss it: But first thou may'st mind, that the Prophets who foretold <HI>Christ's Coming in the Flesh,</HI> and <HI>be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g to be born of a Virgin, and afterwards to suffer Death,</HI> did know these Truths of Fact by the <HI>Inward Inspiration</HI> of GOD without <HI>Out∣ward Means:</HI> For which see 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10, 11. Now that which <HI>hath been, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> This Argument doth at most conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A contingent Truth may be in kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn by Su∣pernatural Knowledge.</NOTE> that we cannot know naturally any Truth of Fact, but by the Relation of another without us, or by the Perception of the outward Senses; because there are naturally in our Minds no Ideas concerning <HI>Contingent Truths</HI> (and every Truth of Fact is a contingent Truth) as there are of <HI>Ne∣cessary Truths.</HI> This then proveth, that we cannot naturally know any contingent Truth, but by the Relation of another, or Perception of the outward Senses: But that hindereth not, but we may know a contingent Truth by a Supernatural Knowledge, GOD supplying the Place of an outward Relator; who is so true, that he may and ought to be believed, sith GOD is the Fountain of Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Form of Revelation is the Voice of God inwardly speaking to the Mind of Man.</HI></NOTE> When <HI>GOD</HI> doth make known unto Men any Matter of Fact by divine, immediate Revelation or Inspiration, GOD speak∣ing as to the Ear of the Heart of the inward Man, or as by his Finger writing it therein, <HI>two</HI> Things are to be considered in such an <HI>immediate Revelation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. TO <HI>Materiale,</HI> The Matter of Fact, or Thing revealed, which is <HI>contingent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. TO <HI>Formale,</HI> The Form or Mode, how the Revelation is made: Which Form is an inward, divine, and supernatural Revelation, which is the <HI>Voice</HI> or <HI>Speech</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> inwardly speaking to the Ear of the inward Man, or Mind of Man, or a divine Writing supernaturally imprinted therein. Now as to the <HI>material Part,</HI> or the Thing and <HI>Matter revealed,</HI> this is indeed a <HI>contingent Truth,</HI> and of it self is not manifest to the <HI>Mind;</HI> but because of the <HI>Form,</HI> that is, because of the <HI>divine Mode,</HI> and <HI>supernatural inward Operation,</HI> the <HI>Matter</HI> is known to be <HI>true.</HI> For that divine and supernatural inward Operation, which the Mind doth feel and perceive in it self, is the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>God</HI> speaking unto Man, which by its Nature and <HI>specifick</HI> Property is as clearly distinguished and understood to be the Voice of GOD, as the Voice of <HI>Peter</HI> or <HI>James</HI> is known to be the Voice of such Men. For every Being as a Being is knowable, and that by its own speci∣fick Nature, or Property proceeding from its Nature; and hath its proper <HI>Idea,</HI> by which it's distinguishable from every other Thing, if so do its Idea be stirred up in us, and clearly proposed to us.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="003104_0531_0FEFF8010318FBE8"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The speaking of God in Man is a superna∣tural Being known by its Virtue.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sixthly,</HI> Now as some Beings are natural, some supernatural, so some <HI>Ideas</HI> are natural, some supernatural: And as when any natural Idea is excited in us, we clearly know it, so also when a Supernatu∣ral Idea is raised, we clearly <HI>know that,</HI> whereof it is the <HI>Idea.</HI> But the Voice of <HI>GOD</HI> speaking to the Mind of Man, is a supernatu∣ral Being, and stirreth up in us a supernatural Idea, by which we clearly know that inward Voice to be the Voice of <HI>God,</HI> and not the Voice or Operation of another, or of any evil Spirit, or Angel, because none of these have a supernatural Idea, as the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> and his divine Operation hath: For it is full of Vigour, Virtue, and divine Glory, as saith the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> who had often Experience of it; and we also in our Measures are Witnesses thereof, for the Voice of <HI>God</HI> is known to be his by its divine Virtue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the in∣ward super∣natural Sense in Man i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Seventhly,</HI> The Senses are either <HI>outward</HI> or <HI>inward;</HI> and the inward Senses are either natural or supernatural: We have an Example of the inward natural Sense in being angered or pacified, in Love and Hatred; or when we perceive and discern any natural Truth, (such as the na∣tural Maxims, to wit, <HI>That the Whole is greater than the Part,</HI> &amp;c.) or when we deduce any Conclusion by the Strength of natural Reason, that Perception also in a larger Sense, may be called an inward Sense. But an Example of an inward supernatural Sense is, when the Heart or Soul of a pious Man feels in it self divine Motions, Influences, and Operations, which sometimes are as the Voice or Speech of <HI>God,</HI> sometimes as a most pleasant and glorious Illustration or visible Ob∣ject to the inward Eye, sometimes as a most sweet Savour or Taste, sometimes as an heavenly and divine Warmness, or (so to speak) Mel∣ting of the Soul in the Love of God. Moreover this divine and super∣natural Operation in the Mind of Man, is a true and most glorious Miracle; which when it is perceived by the inward and supernatural Sense divinely rais'd up in the Mind of Man, doth so evidently and clearly persuade the Understanding to assent to the Thing revealed, that there is no Need of an outward Miracle: For this Assent is not because of the Thing it self, but because of the <HI>Revelation</HI> proposing it, which is the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> For when the <HI>Voice</HI> of God is heard in the <HI>Soul,</HI> the Soul doth as certainly conclude the <HI>Truth</HI> of that Voice, as the Truth of God's Being, from whom it proceeds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contingent and necessary Truths distin∣guished.</NOTE> These Things being thus premised, I now proceed to a direct An∣swer. For what is said, <HI>That God cannot make a contingent Truth to be∣come a necessary Truth,</HI> I agree; but when any contingent Truth is manifest to us by the immediate Revelation of God, there is in it two Things to be considered, to wit, the <HI>Thing revealed</HI> which is <HI>con∣tingent;</HI> and the <HI>Revelation</HI> it self: Which upon the Supposition, that it is a <HI>divine Revelation, is no contingent Truth,</HI> but a most <HI>necessary Truth.</HI> And this all Mankind will say, that this Proposition, <HI>Every divine Revelation is necessarily true,</HI> is as clear and evident, as that Pro∣position, <HI>That every Whole is greater than its Part.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How a divine Revelation is known to be a divine Re∣velation.</NOTE> But thou wilt say, <HI>How knowest thou that a divine Revelation is a di∣vine Revelation?</HI> I answer, How knowest thou, that a <HI>Whole is a Whole,</HI> and a <HI>Part</HI> is a <HI>Part?</HI> Thou wilt say, by the <HI>natural Idea</HI> excited in me of a <HI>Whole,</HI> and of a <HI>Part.</HI> I answer again, Even so a <HI>divine Re∣velation</HI> is known to be such by a <HI>supernatural Idea</HI> of divine Revela∣tion stirred up in us, and that by a divine Motion, or supernatural Operation. But it is no Wonder that Men, who have no Experi∣ence of supernatural Ideas, or at least do not heed them, do deny them; which is, as if a Man naturally blind denied Light or Co∣lours;

or a deaf Man Sounds, because they experience them not, Therefore we cannot dissemble, that we feel a fervent Zeal even di∣vinely kindled in us against such an absurd Opinion, as affirms <HI>That God cannot ascertain us of his Will in any contingent Truth, but by proposing it to the outward Senses,</HI> This Opinion does in a Manner turn <HI>Men</HI> into <HI>Brutes,</HI> as if Man were not to believe his <HI>God</HI> unless he propose what is to be believed to the <HI>outward Senses,</HI> which the Beasts have common with us; yea, it derogates from God's Power, and imputes Weakness to him, as if he could not do that, which not only both good and evil Angels can do, but which the meanest Creatures can do, and the most unsen∣sible.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural and spiritual Sen∣ses distin∣guished by their Objects.</NOTE> As for Instance: The Heat of the Fire, the Coldness of the Air and Water worketh upon us; yea, if a Pin prick us, we feel it, and that by the outward Sense; because the Objects are outward and carnal: But since <HI>GOD</HI> is a most <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>glorious Spirit,</HI> when he operateth in the innermost Parts of our Minds by his Will; shall not he and his Will be clearly felt according to his Nature, that is, by a spiritual and supernatural Sense? For as the Nature of <HI>God</HI> is, so is the Nature of his Will, to wit, <HI>purely Spiritual,</HI> and therefore requireth a spiri∣tual Sense to discern it; which Spiritual Sense, when it is raised up in us by a divine Operation, doth as clearly and certainly know the Voice or Revelation of the Will of God, concerning any Thing which God is pleased to reveal, however contingent, as the outward Sense knows and perceives the outward Object. And it is no less absurd, to require of God, who is a most pure Spirit, to manifest his Will to Men by the outward Senses, else not to be credited; as to require us to see Sounds, and hear Light and Colours. For as the Objects of the outward Senses are not to be confounded, but every Object is to have its proper Sense; so must we Judge of inward and spiritual Objects, which have their proper Sense, whereby they are to be perceived. And tell me, How God doth manifest his Will concerning Matters of Fact, when he sends his Angels to Man, since <HI>Angels</HI> (as is commonly re∣ceived) have not outward Senses, or at least not so gross ones, as ours are? Yea, when Man die, and appear before the Tribunal of God, whether unto eternal Life or Death, how can they know this, having laid down their Bodies, and therewith their outward Senses? And ne∣vertheless this Truth of God is a Truth of <HI>Fact,</HI> as is the historical Truth of Christ's Birth in the Flesh. And which is yet more near: How do good and holy Men even in this Life most certainly know,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How good Men know they are wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God in Fa∣vour.</NOTE> that they are in Favour and Grace with God? No outward Revelation doth make this known unto them; but <HI>The Spirit</HI> (as saith the Apostle) <HI>beareth witness with our Sprits, that we are the Children of God.</HI> For the meer Testimony of a humane Conscience, without the inward Testi∣mony of the holy Spirit, cannot beget in us a firm and immoveable Testimony of our Sonship, because the Heart of Man is deceitful; and if the Testimony thereof were true, at most it is but a humane Testi∣mony, which begetteth in us only a humane Faith: But that Faith, by which holy Men believe they are the Sons of God, is a divine Faith, which leans upon a divine Testimony of the holy Spirit, witnessing in them, that they are the Sons of God. Moreover, when a good Man feels in himself that undeclarable Joy of the holy Spirit, concerning which the holy Scripture speaks, and which is the common Privilege of the Saints, how or whence feels he this Joy? Truly, this Argument concludes no less against this heavenly spiritual Joy, which is begotten in the Souls of the Saints by the holy Spirit, than it does against the <HI>immediate Revelation</HI> of God: For there is no natural Idea of this spi∣ritual Joy, else meer natural Men, yea such as are profane and ungodly,
<PB N="522" REF="003104_0533_0FEFF803CF87D480"/>
would feel it as much as the godly: But because it is a supernatural Thing, therefore it can have no true Idea but what is supernatural. Moreover whence is it that profane Men feel sometimes in themselves the Wrath of God as Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How profane Men do feel the Wrath of God as Fire.</NOTE> when all Things as to the outward, go as prosperously with them as with the Godly, and oftentimes more pros∣perously? For there is no natural Idea in Man of this inward Wrath of God. There is also an inward Grief oftentimes raised up in wicked Men from the Sense of this Wrath of God, which very much vexeth and tormenteth their Minds; and nevertheless this Grief hath no na∣tural Idea in us: For oftentimes wicked Men feel not this Sorrow; for God sometimes is, as it were, silent, while the wicked sin, as in <HI>Psal. i.</HI></P>
<P>All which Things do most clearly demonstrate, That there are in Men <HI>supernatural Ideas</HI> of <HI>supernatural Beings;</HI> which Ideas are never∣theless not perceived by us unless they be stirred up by some <HI>super∣natural Operation</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> which raiseth up in us supernatural and spiritual Senses, which by their Nature are as distinguishable from the natural Senses, whether inward or outward, as the natural Senses are distinguished one from another by their specifick Difference. Of which spiritual Senses the Scripture speaks frequently, as <HI>Heb.</HI> v. and xiv. where is spoken of the spiritual Senses in general, by which the spi∣ritual Man hath the Discerning of Good and Evil: Which Good is of a spiritual Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spiritual Sen∣ses discerning Good and Evil.</NOTE> and conduceth to feed in us a spiritual and divine Life; and the Evil is of that Kind, by which the spiritual Life is in us hurt; to wit, <HI>Sins,</HI> whether carnal or spiritual: All which cannot be discerned but by such who have spiritual Senses stirred up in them, as saith the Apostle. In other Places the Scripture also speaketh of these spiritual Senses in particular; as of the spiritual Seeing, <HI>Psal.</HI> xxxiv. 9. of the spiritual Hearing; <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xxxv. and 9. of spiritual Tasting, <HI>Psal.</HI> xxxiv. viii. of spiritual Smelling, <HI>Cant.</HI> i. 3. of spiritual Touch∣ing, <HI>Acts.</HI> xvii. 8. and in many other Places of Scripture we read of those spiritual Senses in particular. Yea it is the Promise of the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> That <HI>the Glory of God shall be seen of holy Men,</HI> such as are clean of Heart, even in this Life: <HI>Isa.</HI> xxxiii. 17. <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 8. Which were fulfilled in the primitive Christians, see <HI>John.</HI> i. 14. 1 <HI>John</HI> i. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 18. and Chap. iv. 6. But what is this <HI>Vision</HI> of GOD and <HI>di∣vine Glory,</HI> which the <HI>Souls</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI> enjoy in this <HI>Life,</HI> which is Only as the <HI>Earnest</HI> or <HI>first Fruits</HI> of that <HI>more abundant glorious Vision</HI> in the <HI>Life to come,</HI> concerning which the <HI>Scripture so much declareth,</HI> which is the <HI>highest Happiness</HI> of the <HI>IMMORTAL SOƲL?</HI>
For this Argument seemeth to do no lesS Injury to the Saints, than to rob them of this most glorious Treasure both in this Life, and that to come. For there is in us no natural Idea of this divine Glory, as there is not of GOD himself, which is any ways proportionable unto so great Happiness, which the Scripture so much declareth of, by which the Godly are rewarded partly in this Life, and plenarily in that which is to come.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Existence of a most per∣fect Being as∣serted.</NOTE> We confess indeed, there is in all Men, as well the Godly as Ungodly, some Sort of Idea of GOD as of a most perfect Being; and that therefore this Propostion, <HI>There existeth a most perfect Being,</HI> doth as clearly appear to humane Understanding, as that <HI>The Whole is greater than the Part,</HI> And therefore this Proposition, <HI>That a most perfect Being existeth,</HI> ought to be numbered among the Principles that of themselves are manifest. But this Idea of GOD is as mani∣fest to ungodly, as to godly Men; yea, is as clearly perceived by the Devil, as by the most holy Angels: For all the Devils know, that GOD <HI>is;</HI> but yet how blind is the Devil, and all wicked Men, as to the <HI>Vision</HI> of GOD, which is the chief Reward of the Saints.</P>
<P><PB N="523" REF="003104_0534_0FEFF84689C05A68"/>There is then either no such <HI>Vision of GOD,</HI> neither in this Life, nor in that to come; or there is a <HI>supernatural Idea</HI> of GOD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>superna∣tural Idea</HI> of God differs from the na∣tural.</NOTE> <HI>in us,</HI> by which we are made capable of this Vision: Which supernatural Idea of GOD differeth much from that natural Idea of GOD, which <HI>Cartesius</HI> and his Followers so much talk of, albeit others long before <HI>Cartesius</HI> did observe this natural Idea of GOD; and spoke of it.) But the Happiness of the Saints consists not in contemplating this natural Idea of God, else the Wicked would be as happy as the Godly; yea, the very Devil, as the most holy Angel: Since, as is said, both the Devil and most wicked Men do as clearly perceive this natural Idea of GOD, as the most holy Men or Angels.</P>
<P>If the Scripture then be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is in all Men a <HI>super∣natural Idea</HI> of God.</NOTE> there is in Men a <HI>supernatural Idea</HI> of God, which altogether differs from this natural Idea: I say, <HI>in all Men;</HI> because all Men are capable of Salvation, and consequently of enjoy∣ing this <HI>divine Vision.</HI> Now this Capacity consisteth herein, that they have such a supernatural Idea in themselves: For if there were no such Idea in them, it were impossible they should so know GOD. <HI>For what∣soever is clearly and distinctly known, is known by its proper Idea;</HI> neither can it otherways be clearly and distinctly known: For the Ideas of all Things are divinely planted in our Souls; for they are not begotten in us by outward Objects, or outward Causes, (as the better philoso∣phy teacheth) but only are by these outward Things excited or stir∣red up. And this is true not only in supernatural Ideas of GOD and Things divine, and in natural Ideas of the natural Principles of humane Understanding, and Conclusions thence deduced by the Strength of humane Reason; but even in the Ideas of outward Objects, which are perceived by the outward Senses; as that noble Christian Philosopher <HI>Boetius</HI> hath well observed;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boetius</HI> a Christian Phi∣losopher.</NOTE> to which also the <HI>Cartesian Philosophy</HI> agreeth. For when I see any outward Object, whe∣ther it be a Man, or Horse, or Bird, the outward Object does not treat in my Eye, nor yet in my Mind the Idea of those Things; for the outward Object does nothing but imprint in our sensible Organs a Corporeal Motion. Now there is nothing in a corporeal Mo∣tion that can form in us the Ideas of those Things;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Motions of the Body and Mind dis∣tinguished.</NOTE> for all Ideas are of a spiritual Nature: Now nothing that is corporeal can produce that which is spiritual, because <HI>The less Excellent cannot produce the more Excellent,</HI> else the Effect would exceed its Cause; which is against all sound Reason, that it should bring forth what were of a higher and more excellent Kind. Therefore all Ideas, whether of natural or spiritual Things, are <HI>divinely implanted</HI> in our Minds; which never∣theless do not always appear, but sometimes appear, and sometimes are as it were hid in us, and sometimes are stirred up in us by Causes outward or inward, and again do as it were sleep and shun our Obser∣vation, and seem not to be otherways distinguished by our Minds, but as Thoughts and Perceptions of the Mind from the Mind it self; that is, as the Mode from the Subject, or as a bodily Motion from the Body, whereof it is the Motion: <HI>For as is the Relation of a bodily Motion to a Body, so is the Relation of a Thought or Perception of the Mind to the Mind.</HI> In this nevertheless they differ, that the <HI>Mind</HI> can move it self, and operate in it self; which a Body cannot do: But as a <HI>Body</HI> can be moved by another, so also can the <HI>Mind</HI> after its Manner be moved by another, and that both by outward and inward Cau∣ses, but chiefly by God himself, in whose Hand all Souls and Crea∣tures are. But of these Things there is enough said at present; and I hope, I have not thus far impertinently <HI>Philosophized.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="524" REF="003104_0535_0FEFF80631080C38"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Supernatural Ideas</HI> deduci∣ble from the <HI>natural.</HI></NOTE> As there are then natural Ideas concerning the Things of the natural World; as for Instance, Ideas of Light and Colours, Ideas of Voice and Sounds, Ideas of Savouring and Smelling, Ideas of Tasting and Feeling, as of Heat and Cold, of Grief and Joy; it follows also, that there are Ideas of supernatural Things, concerning the divine and su∣pernatural Things of the divine and supernatural World; as Ideas of those Things above mentioned in the spiritual World. And as the natural Ideas are stirred up in us by <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>natural Bodies,</HI> so <HI>those divine</HI> and <HI>supernatural Ideas</HI> are stirred up in us by a certain Principle, which is a Body in <HI>Naturals,</HI> in Relation to the <HI>spiritual World,</HI> and therefore may be called, a <HI>divine Body;</HI> not as if it were a <HI>Part</HI> of GOD, who is a most pure Spirit; but the Organ or Instru∣ment of GOD, by which he worketh in us, and stirreth up in us these Ideas of divine Things.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Flesh &amp; Blood</HI> of Christ, by which the Saints are nourished.</NOTE> <HI>This is that Flesh and Blood of Christ,</HI> by which the Saints are nourished; which is a Mystery to all unregene∣rated and meer natural Men, never to be reached by them, while they remain in that State.</P>
<P>Now if there be such supernatural Ideas, there are also Senses, or perceptive Faculties by which those Ideas are perceived; for those are two Relatives that suppose and infer one another, but in wicked Men those Senses or Faculties do as it were sleep (as the visive Faculty of a blind Man) but in the Godly they are stirred up. Now by these divine and spiritual Senses, which are distinct and distinguishable from all the natural Faculties of the Soul, whether of Imagination, or natural Reason, spiritual-minded Men do behold the Glory and Beauty of GOD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beauty of God makes the Glory of this World despicable.</NOTE> in Respect whereof, and for which all the Glory of this World is despicable to them; yea, even as Dross and Dung. And they also <HI>hear GOD inwardly speaking in their Souls</HI> Words truly divine and heavenly, full of Virtue and divine Life; and they savour and taste of divine Things, and do as it were handle them with the Hands of their Souls. And those heavenly Enjoyments do as really differ in their Nature from all false Similitudes, and fictitious Apppear∣ances of them, which either the Mind of Man by its own Strength can imitate, or any evil Spirit to deceive Man can counterfeit; as a true Man differs from the dead Image of a Man; or true Bread, Ho∣ney, Wine, or Milk doth from the meer Picture of those Things. And albeit either the Imagination of Man, or Subtilty of the Devil, may counterfeit false Likenesses of these Enjoyments, by which Men may be deceived, and no Doubt many are deceived; that doth not hinder, but that those divine Enjoyments are clearly perceived in such, in whom the divine and spiritual Senses are truly opened, and the true supernatural Ideas of those Things truly raised up.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of <HI>Mistakes</HI> by false <HI>Like∣nesses</HI> of <HI>Rea∣son.</HI></NOTE> And if there be at any Time a Mistake, the divine Illumination is not the Cause of that Mistake, but some evil Disposition of the Mind; as hap∣peneth in those Things relating to <HI>natural Reason:</HI> For there are ma∣ny false Appearances of Reason, which differ as much from true Rea∣son, as those false and pretended Revelations, and diabolical Inspira-from such as are truly <HI>divine.</HI> Now, how many Men who would be esteemed Philosophers, are miserably deceived by those false Like∣nesses of Reason, judging their false Reasons to be the true Simili∣tudes of Things, and solid Ratiocinations; which nevertheless moveth no Man of sound Reason to reject sound and solid Reason, as doubtful and uncertain?

one is deceived by false Appearances of Reason, we endeavour to re∣duce them to contemplate the first natural Ideas of natural Things, and to meditate therein, which is as a Test or Touch-stone, by which all the Appearances and Likenesses of Reason are to be examined; if they contradict them, to be rejected. So also when any one is de∣ceived by his own Imagination, or the Cunning of Satan, thinking any <HI>evil Inspiration</HI> of the Devil to be a <HI>true divine Revelation,</HI> he that is so deceived is to be reduced to the natural Ideas of Things (if so be that pretended Revelation doth contradict them, for no true divine Revelation can contradict the true natural Ideas) or to the supernatu∣ral Ideas of <HI>divine Things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>super∣natural Ide∣as</HI> of <HI>divine Things</HI> are most clear and obvious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Mind.</NOTE> which are most simple, clear, and obvious to the Minds of Men, if they will turn their Minds to the <HI>divine Seed</HI> in them; or at least those Ideas are readily and easily stirred up. For as in natural Ideas, so in supernatural some are more easily raised than others: For there is a certain Order both of natural and super∣natural Ideas, whereby they are gradually excited: Nor is there any mortal Man, in whose Mind at some Time or other there is not stir∣red up some Idea that is truly <HI>supernatural</HI> and <HI>divine,</HI> and who hath not felt in himself both the Wrath and Judgment of God for his Sins. And also some tender and gentle Taste of <HI>God</HI>'s Love and Goodness, by which wicked Men are invited to Repentance. Now that which is thought to be a <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> and is felt to contradict any <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>supernatural Idea,</HI> which is clearly perceived in the Soul, it is a manifest Token that it is not a <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> but either a false Imagination, or the wicked Suggestion of some evil Spirit.</P>
<P>But to proceed: If we will hear the <HI>Scripture</HI> (as all Christians ought) it testifies to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God hath de∣clared his Will even in <HI>contingent Truths</HI> in the Scripture.</NOTE> that GOD hath declared his Mind and Will even concerning <HI>contingent Truths to come,</HI> in the Prophets; as that of the first to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> doth evidently declare: <HI>GOD, who at sundry Times, and in divers Manners spoke to our Fathers in the Prophets.</HI> Yea, let us hear the Prophets themselves, <HI>Hosea,</HI> Chap. i. saith plainly, <HI>That the Word of the LORD was made in him</HI> (as it is in the,<HI>Heb.) Habak∣kuk</HI> also says,<HI>As he was standing on his Watch, to see what</HI> Jehovah <HI>would speak in him.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Revelations</HI> were in the Minds of the Prophets by inward Inspi∣rations.</NOTE> And it is so manifest, that the most <HI>heavenly Revelations</HI> are by <HI>inward Illustrations</HI> and <HI>Inspirations</HI> in the very Minds of the Pro∣phets; that it is strange how any that believes the Scripture should doubt of it. And if it happened at any Time, such Revelations were made in the natural Imaginations of the Prophets, or any of their in∣ward natural Senses; then it may be confessed, they could not be in∣fallibly certain, they came from <HI>GOD,</HI> unless they also felt God in the <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Supernatural Senses,</HI> by which they did most nearly ap∣proach to him, from these superior and most inward Senses working upon the lower and less noble Faculties of the Mind. But which ever Way the Prophets were certain, that they were <HI>Inspired of GOD,</HI> even when they foretold Contingent Truths to come; it is without Doubt, they were most certainly perswaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which were most certain without any outward mi∣raculous De∣monstrations.</NOTE> that they were divinely inspired, and that frequently without any outward Miracle. For <HI>John the Baptist</HI> did no Miracle; and many prophesied, where there apppear∣ed no Miracle, as in the Scripture may be often observed. And we also by the <HI>Inspiration of the same divine Spirit,</HI> by which the Prophets prophesied, do believe their Words and Writings to be <HI>divine</HI> concer∣ning contingent Truths, as well past as to come; else that Faith, by which we believe the Scripture, would not be <HI>divine,</HI> but <HI>meerly hu∣mane.</HI> And thence we need no outward Miracles to move us to be∣lieve the Scriptures; and therefore much less were they necessary to the Prophets who writ them. For we see in many Places of the Pro∣phets,
<PB N="526" REF="003104_0537_0FEFF807F8377AC0"/>
where they declare Prophecies as revealed to them of <HI>GOD,</HI> there is not a Word mentioned of any outward Miracle, as that by which alone they were certain of it. Moreover, the Falseness of this Argument doth appear, in that the Scripture doth declare many con∣tingent Truths to have been revealed to the Prophets in Dreams:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divine Re∣velations by Dreams.</NOTE> Now as natural and wicked Men do not see what they dream by a real Per∣ception of the outward Senses, but by inward Ideas which are present∣ed to the Mind, and perceived by it; so it is also in <HI>divine Revelations</HI> of this Nature. Of which we have a clear Example in <HI>Joseph,</HI> the Husband of the blessed Virgin, who, when he observed his Wife with Child, was told in a Dream, That she had conceived by the Holy Ghost: Now I would know, to which of <HI>Joseph's outward Senses</HI> was this revealed? Or what Miracle had he to induce him to believe? Which could neither be proved, (so as to make an infallible Appli∣cation to <HI>Mary</HI>) by the Testimony of the Scripture; and which being against the Order of Nature, did choak his Reason. The Scripture mentions no Miracle in this Matter; and yet no doubt <HI>Joseph</HI> had highly sinned had he not believed this Revelation, and notwithstand∣ing rejected his Wife as an Adulteress. But if thou say'st, That ac∣cording to thy <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> there must have been a Miracle; that is on∣ly to beg the Question: And how false this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> is, the Apostle shews clearly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The outward Senses cannot discern the Things of God, for they are spiritual.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14. <HI>The natural or animal Man knoweth not, re∣ceiveth not the Things of GOD.</HI> Now <HI>divine Revelations</HI> are of this Na∣ture; and if either chiefly or only those Things were to be judged by the outward Senses, it would contradict the Apostle. For <HI>natural Men</HI> yea, the <HI>most Wicked</HI> have the Use of the outward Senses as true and exact as the <HI>most Godly.</HI> And whereas the Apostle adds, <HI>For they are spiritually discerned,</HI> it puts the Matter out of all Question: For thence it abundantly appears, that this Discerning is not by the outward Sen∣ses, according to the following Verse; for the Apostle saith, <HI>The spi∣ritual Man judgeth all Things:</HI> This then must be done by some Senses or Properties peculiar to the spiritual Man, and in which he excels the natural Man, which is not in the outward Senses (as all do know) Therefore the Perception of <HI>spiritual Things cannot be by the outward Sen∣ses, either as the chief or only Means,</HI> as is fals;ly contended for.</P>
<P>Now as to these Words of the Apostle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether Faith comes by the out∣ward Hear∣ing.</NOTE> <HI>Rom.</HI> x. <HI>That Faith comes by Hearing, Zuinglius</HI> observed well, That the Apostle intended not to af∣firm <HI>Faith</HI> to come by the Hearing of the <HI>outward Word;</HI> neither do the following Words prove it, <HI>How shall they believe, unless they hear? And how shall they hear without a Preacher? And how shall they preach unless they be sent?</HI> For the Apostle uses these Words, not as his Arguments, but as Objections which might be formed; as the same Apostle uses in other Places; to which Objections he answers in the same Chapter, as appears, <HI>ver.</HI> 18. <HI>But I say, have they not all heard? Yes truly, their Voice went into all the Earth: That is, of the Father and Son, or the Father in the Word; which Word is not only near us, but</HI> (according to the same Apostle in the same Chapter) <HI>in our Mouths, and in our Hearts.</HI> But further thou canst conclude nothing from this, but <HI>that Faith is begotten by out∣ward Hearing only, and no otherwise:</HI> For this is the Strength of thy Ar∣gument, <HI>That since Faith cannot be without outward Hearing;</HI> therefore nothing can certainly be believed, but where somewhat is proposed to the outward Hearing. For if thou acknowledge Faith can be be∣gotten any otherwise than by Hearing, thou losest the Strength of thy Argument: And if that Argument hold, <HI>That Faith comes only by outward Hearing,</HI> thou destroyest the whole <HI>Hypothesis.</HI> For having be∣fore affirmed, <HI>That outward Miracles are sufficient to render one certain of
<PB N="527" REF="003104_0538_0FEFF84CD8677B78"/>
the Truth of any Revelation;</HI> those Miracles, whether it be the Healing of the Sick, or the Raising of the Dead, would avail nothing, because those (as for the most Part all Miracles,) are obvious to the <HI>Sight,</HI> not to the <HI>Hearing:</HI> And if it be not by <HI>outward Hearing</HI> only, thou canst conclude nothing from this Place.</P>
<P>But I the more wonder thy using of this Argument, considering the Discourse we had together before we entred upon this Debate: For when we were speaking of the Opinion of a certain Person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A certain Person pla∣cing the Cer∣tainty of eve∣ry Thing in the outward Senses.</NOTE> who de∣nied the Certainty of every Thing, but what was discerned by the outward Senses, thou condemnedst it as most absurd; But <HI>why</HI> I can∣not conceive, since there is no great Difference betwixt those two Opi∣nions: The one saith, <HI>There can be no great Certainty concerning any Truths, whether they be</HI> necessary, <HI>or</HI> contingent, <HI>but by the Perception of the Senses:</HI> The other affirms the same of contingent Truths, tho' not of neces∣sary Truths. But among the Number of contingent Truths, thou esteemest what belongs to Christian Religion; for thou reckons the necessary Truths only to belong to natural Religion. This then is all the Difference, that that other Person says, There is no Certainty of any Religion, neither natural nor Christian, but by the Perception of the outward Senses: But thou say'st, Tho' thou esteemest the Cer∣tainty of natural Religion to be without them, yet not of the Chri∣stian Religion. But again, since thou esteemest, that not natural Re∣ligion, but the Christian Religion is necessary to Salvation; thou must necessarily conclude, That those Truths which are necessary to Sal∣vation, are only known and believed by the Benefit of the outward Senses: In which Conclusion (which is the Sum af all) thou yieldest the Matter to that other Person.</P>
<P>But lastly: If all the Certainty of our <HI>Faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Outward Sen∣ses can be de∣ceived.</NOTE> <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> did depend upon the <HI>Infallibility</HI> of <HI>outward Senses,</HI> we should be most mi∣serable; since these Senses can be easily deceived, and by many out∣ward Casualties, and natural Infirmities, whereunto the Godly are no less subject than the Wicked, are often vitiated; and there are (as the Scripture affirms,) <HI>false Miracles,</HI> which, as to the outward, cannot be distinguished from the true; of which we cannot infallibly judge by the outward Senses, which only discern what is outward,</P>
<P>'There is a Necessity then to have R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>course to some other Means.</P>
<P>From all which it does appear, how fallacious and weak this Ar∣gument is: But Thanks be unto GOD, who would not that our Faith should be built upon so uncertain and doubtful a Foundation. And whoever hath known true Faith, or hath felt the <HI>divine Testi∣mony of GOD's Spirit</HI> in his Soul, will judge otherways; neither will be moved by such Reasonings. I pray GOD therefore to remove these Clouds which darken thy Understanding, that thou may'st per∣ceive the glorious Gospel of CHRIST: This is that saving Word of Grace, which I commend thee unto; and that GOD may give thee a Heart inclinable to believe and obey the Truth, is the De∣sire of</P>

<HEAD><HI>A brief and distinct Solution of the Argument which the</HI> Ambas∣sador <HI>aforesaid useth against</HI> Robert Barclay<HI>'s</HI> THESES, <HI>whereby he attempts to evince, That not the inward Revelati∣on of the Holy Spirit, but the outward by the Scripture, is the Principal Rule and Foundation of our Faith, at least to us</HI> Eu∣ropeans <HI>who have the Scriptures.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS to his Argument, as it was transmitted to us, if he consi∣ders the Strength and Substance of it, thus it stands; <HI>The His∣tory of the outward Coming, Nativity, Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ, is either necessary to their Salvation, to whom the Scriptures came, or it is not necessary,</HI> viz. <HI>to be known and believed: If we say the</HI> Second, <HI>namely, That that History is not necessary to be known and believed in order to the Salvation of us</HI> Europeans <HI>who have the Scriptures, then it will follow that we are not</HI> Christians; <HI>because we deny that True, Essential and Constituti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Character of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>which consists in believing that Christ was sent into the World, Born of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>Dead and Buried, Rose again the Third Day, Ascended into Heaven, where he sitteth at the Right Hand of the Father,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But if we say the</HI> First, viz. <HI>That the Knowledge and Faith of the History are necessary to our Salvation; then it will follow, that the Scripture, and not the inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, is the Principal Rule and Foundation of that Historical Faith and Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Now this he endeavours to prove, both from some other Principles of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, and from <HI>R. B</HI>'s sixth <HI>Thesis,</HI> after this Man∣ner.</P>
<P><HI>That,</HI> said the Ambassador, <HI>is the principal Rule and Foundation of our Faith, which is the only</HI> Medium <HI>or</HI> Mean, <HI>whereby that Historical Knowledge and Faith are brought unto us: But, according to the</HI> Quakers, <HI>and the sixth</HI> Thesis, <HI>the Scripture is the only</HI> Medium <HI>or</HI> Mean, <HI>whereby that Historical Knowledge and Faith are brought unto us: Therefore, according to the</HI> Quakers, <HI>and the sixth</HI> Thesis, <HI>the Scripture is the Principal Rule and Foundation of our Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Minor</HI> he proves thus; <HI>The Author of the</HI> Theses (says he) <HI>con∣fesseth in his sixth</HI> Thesis, <HI>That there is a People, to whom God, by some</HI> ine∣vitable Accident, <HI>hath made that Historical Knowledge and Faith impossible: And the Reason why that Historical Knowledge and Faith are impossible to that People, is, because they are destitute of the Scriptures, and live in those Corners of the World, whereunto the outward Preaching of the History never came; from which Argument it will follow, that the Scriptures are the only</HI> Medium <HI>or</HI> Mean, <HI>whereby the Historical Knowledge and Faith of Christ came to any People.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearer understanding the Solution of this Argument, some Things worthy Observation are to be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>First</HI> then observe, that the Force of this Argument at most in∣tends to prove this, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Scripture is the Principal Rule and Foundation of Historical Faith and Knowledge; but we with good Reason distinguish between <HI>Historical</HI> and <HI>Saving Knowledge,</HI> and between <HI>Historical</HI> and <HI>Saving Faith;</HI> because many may have an <HI>Historical Know∣ledge and Faith,</HI> who have not that which is <HI>Saving.</HI> Yea, it is possible, that a Man, by the inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, may have an <HI>Historical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> who yet may not have that Faith which is <HI>Saving;</HI> because <HI>Saving Faith</HI> hath regard to God, not precisely, as revealing some outward History concerning God and Christ, but as Revealing very <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> by his Grace, Goodness, Mercy, and
<PB N="529" REF="003104_0540_0FEFF84F900DB9D8"/>
Power, ready and willing to save us, according to his unspeakable Good∣will towards us; by which <HI>Saving Faith</HI> we rest upon God thro' <HI>Christ, our Light and Life,</HI> as upon our most merciful Father; which Faith can neither exist, nor be conceived without Love to God, Humility be∣fore God, Denial and Dissidence of Self; and therefore such a Faith is <HI>Saving.</HI> But <HI>Historical Faith,</HI> tho' wrought in the Hearts of Men by the inward Revelation and Operation of the Holy Spirit, may be without that Divine Love, Humility and Self-denial: Wherefore pre∣cisely considered in its own Nature, it is not <HI>Saving.</HI> 'Twas this kind of Knowledge and Faith which wicked <HI>Balaam</HI> had, who saw and knew many Historical Futurities, and believed them, but had not <HI>Saving Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Observe, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Knowledge and Faith necessary to Salvation are to be understood two Ways, either by a <HI>Necessity Antece∣dent,</HI> or <HI>in Way of Priority,</HI> or by a <HI>Necessity Consequent</HI> or <HI>in Way of Po∣steriority. Necessity Antecedent,</HI> or <HI>in Way of Priority,</HI> is, when some∣thing is absolutely necessary to our Salvation, that we both know and believe it; and because it is necessary, God doth therefore reveal it to us; of which Sort are such Principles as these, <HI>viz.</HI> That God fol∣lows Men with his Love and Good-will; that he invites and perswades them to come unto him; that he is ready to shew Favour to Men, and pardon their Sins, if they sincerely repent themselves of their past mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pent Life, and lead a new one for the Time to come; that God hears the Prayers of those that are truly humble and suppliant; that he is a glorious Rewarder of all that live soberly, righteously, and godly; that he is a most just Avenger against all those who despise his Grace and Love, and repent not of their Sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which, in some Degree, are to all Men, even to those who are destitute of the Scriptures, reveal∣ed by that inward <HI>Evangelical Light,</HI> which <HI>enlightens all Men. Necessity Consequent</HI> or <HI>in Way of Posteriority,</HI> is, when something is not absolute∣ly necessary to our Salvation, but after a certain Sort, or under some Respect, Condition and Limitation; of which Kind are those Things which are not revealed, because they are necessary; but because they are revealed, they are necessary to be believed by us: For Example; if God should reveal to any Man, that it was his Will and Command, he should go to <HI>Rome</HI> to reprove Tyranny and Superstition; certainly this Revelation were necessary to be believed to that Man's Salvation, by a <HI>Necessity Consequent,</HI> because that Faith is an Act of Obedience; and to obey God is necessary to Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Observe in the Third Place, That among those Things that are necessary to be believed to Salvation by a <HI>Necessity Consequent,</HI> there are some Things, tho' not absolutely necessary, yet are they very profita∣ble and conducive Means to our Salvation; of which Sort are the Hi∣storical Knowledge and Faith concerning God, the Creation and Go∣vernment of the World, Christ's taking Flesh, and dying therein for our Sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whether that <HI>Historical Knowledge</HI> come to us, either by the sole inward Revelation of the Holy Spirit, without the <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> of Scripture, or also by both, to wit, both by the inward Inspi∣ration of the Holy Spirit, and by the Scriptures; which two <HI>Mediums</HI> or <HI>Means</HI> do sometimes concur in producing in Men <HI>Historical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> concerning God and Christ, as is said before, but in a diffe∣rent Manner. The outward Revelation (as 'tis called) of Scripture is a <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean,</HI> by Way of <HI>Material Object,</HI> in producing that <HI>Hi∣storical Knowledge and Faith:</HI> But the inward Inspiration and Revelation wrought in the Hearts of Men by the Holy Spirit, are a <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> by way of <HI>Formal Object,</HI> in producing the same <HI>Historical Know∣ledge</HI>
<PB N="530" REF="003104_0541_0FEFF80EFB42BB08"/>
and <HI>Faith.</HI> By the <HI>Material Object,</HI> we understand that which is believed; and therefore the Scriptures, which are believed, are the <HI>Material Object</HI> of <HI>Historical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith.</HI> By the <HI>Formal Object,</HI> we understand the principal Motive <HI>in respect of the Object, for which</HI> the Scriptures are believed. But the Principal Motive <HI>in respect of the Object</HI> is not the Scripture it self, but that inward Testimony of the Holy Spirit, which when we hear or read the Scriptures (when it pleaseth the most good and great God to inspire the Hearts of Men) works an Assent in us, whether it inclines us to assent to the Historical Truths hitherto declared in the Scriptures or no: Wherefore we do not affirm that the Holy Spirit doth ordinarily and commonly speak in us something that is <HI>New,</HI> or declare to our inward Hearing those par∣ticular Histories of God and Christ (tho' God may, if he shall please, do it at this Day;) but we say, that God doth by his Holy Spirit, thro' his sensible and perceptible Motions and Operations Objectively representing themselves, move and incline us to assent unto and believe the Scriptures and the Historical Truths declared of in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>These Things consider'd, we affirm, that tho' the Scriptures are ordi∣narily and commonly a certain <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> by way of <HI>Material Ob∣ject</HI> or Condition, for the producing of <HI>Historical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> in us, and that, commonly speaking, a necessary <HI>Mean</HI> too, as being that without which God doth not ordinarily reveal the outward History of God and Christ; yet we utterly deny that in true Christians, the Scripture or outward History in the Scriptures, is the Principal Mo∣tive, Foundation or Principal Rule of that <HI>Historical Faith,</HI> much less of <HI>Saving Faith,</HI> to the Producing of which the Letter of the Scrip∣ture doth very frequently (as to many of its Acts, if not all) not con∣cur or co-operate, either as a <HI>Material Object,</HI> or as a necessary Condi∣tion, which is wont commonly to be called in the <HI>Schools, Causa sine qua non,</HI> or a Cause or Condition without which a Thing cannot be done, tho' it doth not influence the Effect.</P>
<P>Now for a direct Solution of the Argument aforesaid, We answer, that the <HI>Historical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> concerning Christ's being Born, Dead, Buried, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to us <HI>Europeans,</HI> who have the Scriptures, are ne∣cessary to Salvation, that is to say, by a <HI>Necessity Consequent,</HI> or in <HI>Way of Posteriority,</HI> (as was before explained) which Assertion of ours ne∣vertheless militates not against the <HI>Sixth Thesis,</HI> which granteth, that that <HI>Historical Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> are impossible to those who live in those Corners of the World, where the Knowledge of the History is wanting; which Impossibility is not absolutely to be understood, but after a Sort, and in some Respect; because without Doubt God doth ordinarily communicate that Historical Knowledge unto Men, by the <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> of the Scriptures; yet not as by the Principal <HI>Me∣dium</HI> or <HI>Mean,</HI> much less as by the <HI>only</HI> one: Because certainly that in∣ward Motion of the Holy Spirit wrought in our Hearts, moving and inclining us <HI>Objectively</HI> to assent unto and believe the Scriptures, is the Principal Motive <HI>in respect of the Object, for which</HI> we believe the Scrip∣tures, and therefore is the Foundation and Principal Rule of our <HI>Histo∣rical Faith</HI> also.</P>
<P>Wherefore we answer unto the <HI>Minor Proposition</HI> of the last <HI>Syllogism,</HI> by plainly and directly denying that <HI>Minor Proposition, viz.</HI> That the Scriptures are the only <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean</HI> for attaining to the Knowledge of the History: They are indeed one certain <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean,</HI> and that necessary; but they are not the <HI>only</HI> nor principal. An Example for the Illustration hereof occurs in Natural and Outward Vision: For when I see a white or red Rose, that white or red Rose is the <HI>Material Object</HI>
<PB N="531" REF="003104_0542_0FEFF851E64A0080"/>
of my Sight, and one necessary <HI>Medium</HI> for the producing of that Sight; yet that Rose is not the only <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Mean;</HI> for the Light is another, no less necessary, concurring to produce my Sight, by way of <HI>Formal Object,</HI> by Means of which I see that Rose represented under such or such a Colour and Figure. Moreover, in that he asserts, <HI>These inward Motions wrought by the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of Believers, are so undiscernible by us, that Believers cannot clearly and infallibly distinguish them from their own private and proper Motions:</HI> This he supposes, but proves not. And therein he is deceived, either thro' his Inexperience, or Want of that due Waiting, and Attention to those Motions in the Divine Illumination of Christ, wherewith he hath enlightened both him [the <HI>Ambassador</HI>] and all Men coming into the World. But our Experience, together with the Experience of the Holy Prophets and Apostles, is a stronger Motive to induce us to believe, that Divine, In∣ward Revelation is sufficiently clear and convincing by its own Light and Evidence, than his own bare and jejune Supposition to the contra∣ry, by reason of his Want of Experience or Attention.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Latin,</HI> we have not been very curious in this Writing, by reason of Haste; yet have briefly answered the Argument as a Friend communicated it to us by Letter; if he hath omitted any Thing in his Transmission, or we may seem not to have understood or touch'd the Strength of the Argument, let it be remitted to us; and we, thro' Divine Assistance, shall answer it at large.</P>

<HEAD>A brief Enodation of an Argument proposed by another Person.</HEAD>
<P>MOreover as to what relates to another Person's Argument against that Part of <HI>R. B</HI>'s second <HI>Thesis,</HI> which asserts, <HI>That Divine In∣ward Revelation is that which is evident and clear of it self, moving the well-disposed Ʋnderstanding by its own Evidence,</HI> &amp;c. to the End of the <HI>The∣sis.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument is thus formed; <HI>Such an Evidence as is asserted in the</HI> Thesis, <HI>is destructive of Faith, because it is not the Evidence of Faith.</HI> He proves the <HI>Antecedent</HI> by the Words of the Apostle, <HI>Faith is the Evidence of Things not seen,</HI> Heb. xi. 1. By which Words the Apostle seems to in∣timate, <HI>That Faith hath not this Kind of Evidence; for if it were of Things seen, it would contradict the Apostle.</HI></P>
<P>The Solution of this Argument is easie; for Evidence is three-fold.</P>
<P>The First is <HI>the Evidence of Things sensible,</HI> appertaining to the out∣ward Senses.</P>
<P>The Second is <HI>the Evidence of things intellectual, but Natural,</HI> apper∣taining to Natural Reason.</P>
<P>The Third is <HI>the Evidence of Things Spiritual and Supernatural,</HI> as they are proposed to the Understanding, by the inward Illumination and Revelation of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>The first Evidence may be called <HI>the Evidence of Sense,</HI> or <HI>Animal Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>The Second, <HI>the Evidence of Reason,</HI> or <HI>Rational Evidence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="003104_0543_0FEFF810CA393BB8"/>The Third, <HI>the Evidence of Faith,</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>But Faith is the Evidence of Things not seen, <HI>that is,</HI> neither visible by the outward Senses, or by natural Reason; yet these Things hinder not, but that Faith may be the Evidence of Things not seen by the Understanding of a Man, not as operating in its own natural Way, but as Divinely elevated and assisted by the inward Illumination and Ope∣ration of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, tho' Things appertaining to Faith may be very obscure, and as it were mere Darkness, both to the outward Senses, and natural Reason; yet they have their Evidence if duly proposed to an Understanding Divinely inlightned. Is it not said in the same Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> concerning <HI>Moses,</HI> that by <HI>Faith he saw God?</HI> That is to say, not by the <HI>outward Eye,</HI> nor by <HI>the Eye of na∣tural Reason;</HI> but by the <HI>Eye of Faith.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Penn</HI> and <HI>Bar∣clay</HI> visit the Princess, and have Meetings in her Apart∣ment, with the Countess of <HI>Hornes,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Gen∣tlewoman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> This Correspondence gave Occasion to <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>R. Barclay</HI> to pass towards <HI>Herford,</HI> a Town on the Frontiers of <HI>Paderborn,</HI> and to give the said Princess, who resided there, a Visit. With her lived <HI>Anna Maria,</HI> Countess of <HI>Hornes;</HI> and in one of the Chambers of the Princess, <HI>W. P.</HI> and <HI>R. B.</HI> had a Meeting with the Princess, the Countess, and several others to their great Satisfaction. And the Countess who was one of <HI>Labadie</HI>'s Adherents, signified to <HI>W. Penn,</HI> that she wish'd a Meeting might be had where the inferior Servants might freely appear. <HI>W. Penn</HI> not refusing this, the Princess consented to it; and after the Meeting, (where she was not herself, that so her Servants might have a more free Access) she exprest much Satisfaction in having had that good Opportunity. And then so earnestly invited <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>R. Barclay,</HI> (who lodged at an Inn) to sup with her, that they not being well able to refuse the Invitation, yielded to it. There was then with her a <HI>French</HI> Woman of Quality, who having had before a very slight Opinion of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> now be∣came deeply broken, and very affectionately kind and respectful to <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>R. Barclay.</HI> The next Day was the First of the Week; and it being agreed with the Princess to have another Meeting, <HI>W. Penn</HI> desired that not only as many of her own Family, but as many of the Town as would willingly be there, might be admitted. To this she yielded. And thus <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>R. Barclay</HI> had a large Opportunity to preach effectually, and to discharge themselves. After the Meeting was done, the Princess came to <HI>W. Penn,</HI> and taking him by the Hand, she spoke to him of the Sense she had of the Power and Presence of God that had been among them; and thus going on she broke forth into an extraordinary Passion, crying out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Afterwards take their solemn Leave, and <HI>Barclay</HI> returns to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> while <HI>Penn</HI> goes to <HI>Pader∣horn, Cassel</HI> &amp; <HI>Frankford,</HI> where he has a Meeting at the House of <HI>J. E. Merlane</HI> a Virgin of noble Birth.</NOTE> <HI>I cannot speak to you, my Heart is full,</HI> clapping her Hand upon her Breast. This affected <HI>W. Penn</HI> not a little, yet he spoke a few Words to her by Way of Admonition; and then taking his leave of her, she said, <HI>Will you not come hither again? Pray call here as ye return out of</HI> Germany. To this he returned, <HI>We are in the Hand of the Lord, and being at his Pleasure, cannot so fully dispose of our selves.</HI> Solemn Leave then being taken, <HI>R. Barclay</HI> returned to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and <HI>W. Penn</HI> went to <HI>Paderborn,</HI> and so by the Way of <HI>Cassel</HI> (where he spoke with the Aged and Learned <HI>Dureus</HI>) to <HI>Frankfort.</HI> Here he found several Persons of Note, with whom he had several Times a Meeting, and once at the House of a young Gentlewoman, noble of Birth, called <HI>Johanna Eleonora Merlane,</HI> who said to him, <HI>Our Quarters are free for you, let all come that will come, and lift up your Voices without Fear.</HI></P>

I do long for it; and when he assures my Ways, I hope he will give me Power to bear the Cross I meet therein; I am also glad to hear the Journey hath been pros∣perous both in the Constitutions of your Bodies, to withstand the Badness of the Weather, and in the Reception you had in <HI>Cassel, Frankfort,</HI> and <HI>Chrisheim.</HI> Nothing surprised me there but the good old <HI>Dury,</HI> in when I did not expect so much Ingenuity, having lately writ a Book, intitled, <HI>Le veritable Chretien</HI> that doth speak in another Way.

<P>Whilst <HI>W. Penn</HI> made this Journey into <HI>Germany,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">G. F. <HI>gone to</HI> Hamburgh <HI>and</HI> Frederickstad.</NOTE> <HI>G. F.</HI> was gone to <HI>Hamburg</HI> and <HI>Frederickstad,</HI> to visit his Friends there; and <HI>Penn</HI> being returned to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> went from thence to <HI>Friesland,</HI> and met <HI>G.

After some Dis∣course from both Sides, when <HI>Yoon</HI> had given a Relation concerning <HI>John de Labadie,</HI> how he was bred among the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and deserted them, and embraced the Protestant Religion, and how becoming dissatisfied with the formal Protestants, he with some that adhered to him, had separated themselves from the vulgar Assemblies; <HI>Anna Maria Schurman</HI> began to speak, and gave an Account of her former Life, <Q>Of her Pleasure in Learning, and her Love to the Religion she was brought up in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e this Dis∣course much more at large in <HI>W.

Living and Acquaintance, and to join her self with this little Family, that was retired out of the World.</Q> This and much more she spoke in a sensible Frame, and with a serious Mind, not without some Tremb∣ling. And then one of the <HI>Somersdykes</HI> gave also an ample Relation, concerning her inward State, and how she had been reached by the Preach∣ing of <HI>Labadie;</HI> and how before that Time she had mourned because of the Deadness and Formality of the vulgar Christians, and said within herself, <HI>O the Pride, the Lusts, the vain Pleasures in which Christians live! Can this be the Way to Heaven? Is this the Way to Glory? Are these Followers of Christ? O no! O God, where is thy little Flock! Where is thy little Family that will live entirely to thee, that will follow thee; make me one of that Number.</HI> Then she told <Q>How being prickt to the Heart, when she heard <HI>Labadie</HI> preach, she had resolved to abandon the Glory and Pride of this World; and farther said that she counted herself happy to have joined with this separated Family.</Q> After some others had likewise given an Account of their Change, <HI>W. Penn</HI> also gave a Circumstantial Relation <Q>How he had been gradually drawn off from the Vanity and Pride of Life; what Adversities he had met with in the University at <HI>Oxford,</HI> because of his not joining with the De∣bauchery committed there; and how after having lived some Time in <HI>France,</HI> he had been convinced by the effectual Ministry of <HI>Thomas Loe,</HI> and so came to be joined with the despised <HI>Quakers.</HI></Q> This his Relation he concluded with a serious Admonition how they ought to go on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pastor's Caution to <HI>W.

At parting one of the Pastors askt him, <HI>If the Truth rose not first amongst a poor, illiterate, and simple Sort of People. Yes,</HI> answered <HI>W.

W. Penn</HI> having answered to the Purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. P.</HI> travels by <HI>Groening∣hen</HI> to <HI>Emb∣den,</HI> where he speaks to Burgo-master <HI>Andre</HI> about a <HI>Latin</HI> Letter formerly sent him against Persecution of the <HI>Quakers.</HI></NOTE> took his Leave, and travelled by Way of <HI>Groeninghen</HI> to <HI>Embden,</HI> where the <HI>Quakers</HI> at that Time were perse∣cuted severely with Imprisonments and Banishments: But I wave the Relation thereof, because it hath long ago been published in Print, and the Magistrates there, being afterward moved to Pity by the Persecu∣tion the Protestants suffered in <HI>France,</HI> came to better Resolution, as may be mentioned in the Sequel.</P>
<P>When <HI>W. Penn</HI> came to <HI>Embden,</HI> he went to speak with the Burger-master <HI>Andre</HI> at his House, and askt him, <HI>If he and the Senate had not received a Letter in</HI> Latin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Which being translated into <HI>English</HI> runs thus,</P>

<P><HI>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who is God of all the Families of the Earth, incline your Hearts to Justice, Mercy and Truth.</HI></P>
<P>THe Noise of your severe Treatment of several Persons that are Inhabitants of your State, reproachfully termed QUAKERS, hath reached these Parts, and filled se∣veral with Compassion and Surprise: <HI>Compassion,</HI> to hear of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Our Account says, some were <HI>cruelly beaten</HI> by <HI>Order;</HI> o∣thers <HI>Banish∣ed;</HI> some put in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</NOTE> Miseries of Men innocent and upright, against whom you have nothing to object, but the pure <HI>Exercise of their Con∣science</HI> to God: <HI>Surprise,</HI> That you, a <HI>Protestant-state,</HI> should employ your civil Power to deter, punish, and grievously afflict Men, for answering the Convictions of their Consciences, and acting according to the best of their Understandings. Methinks you should not be obli∣vious of your own Condition in the <HI>Loyns</HI> of your Ancestors, who, you think, with great Reason and Justice, strenuously advocated the Cause of <HI>Liberty of Conscience</HI> against the <HI>Popes</HI> Bulls and the <HI>Spanish Inquisition;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">and fed with <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Water</HI> only; several <HI>fined</HI> greater Sums of <HI>Money,</HI> it is thought, than they had to pay</NOTE> how did they <HI>Antichristian</HI> all Force on Conscience or Punishment for <HI>Non-conformity?</HI> Their own many and large Apologies, and particularly their Demands at the <HI>Diets</HI> of <HI>Norimberg</HI> and <HI>Spira,</HI> are pregnant Proofs in the Case; and your Practice doth not lessen the Weight of their Reasons; on the contrary, it aggravates your Unkindness, let me say, Injustice.</P>
<P><HI>Protestants,</HI> (and such you glory to be thought) got their Name by protesting against Imposition; and will you turn Imposers? They condemned it, and will you practise it? They thought it a Mark peculiar to the <HI>Beast;</HI> and can you repute it the Care of a <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Magistracy? I mean, that Persons must not live under your Government, unless they receive your Mark in their <HI>Forehead</HI> or <HI>Right-hand?</HI> Which in plainer Terms is, to submit their Consciences to your Edicts, <HI>and to ask your Leave what Religion they should be of.</HI> Re∣member, that <HI>Faith is the Gift of God;</HI> and, that <HI>What is not of Faith is Sin:</HI> Nothing can be more unreasonable, than to compel Men to believe against their Belief, or to trouble them for practising what they believe, when it thwarts not the Moral Law of God.</P>
<P>You doubtless take your selves to be <HI>Christians,</HI> and would esteem it no little Injury to be otherwise represented; yet what more <HI>Unchristian,</HI> than to use external Force, to sway the Consciences of Men about the Exercise of Religious Worship.</P>
<P><HI>CHRIST Jesus,</HI> the Lord and Author of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, censured his own Disciples, that would have had Fire from Heaven to destroy those that conformed not to what their blessed Master taught: Are you surer of your Religion? Are you better <HI>Chri∣stians?</HI> Or, have you more <HI>Christian</HI> Authority, than they that were the chosen Wit∣nesses of Jesus? However remember, they called but for Fire from Heaven; and can you kindle Fire on Earth to devour them? <HI>Them,</HI> I say, that are of your own People, meerly for their religious Dissent from you? Doubtless, if that was then thought no fit Argument to induce Men to Conformity by him that was wiser than <HI>Solomon,</HI> it reflects greatly upon your Modesty and Prudence, that you should find out new Ways, or rather old exploded ones, to effect so ill a Design. Besides, you do not say, you know all you ought to know, or that there is nothing farther to be revealed; have a Care therefore, that you persecute not A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gels, by being harsh to that which you call strange: Think not ill, much less speak, and least of all act that which is so against what you do not perfectly understand. I am well perswaded, that those you inflict such severe Penalties upon, mean well in what they believe (to be sure much better than you think they do, or else you are extremely to blame) and that the Reason of their present Distance from you, is not to introduce or in∣sinuate dangerous or exotick Opinions; but to live a Life of more Holiness, Purity and Self-denial, than before: They do not think that you walk up to your own Principles; and have Reason to believe that the Power of Godliness is much lost among you; and having long lain under a Decay and Languishing of Soul for want of true spiritual Nourishment, they have now betaken themselves to that heavenly <HI>Gift and Grace</HI> of God in themselves for divine Satisfaction, even that holy <HI>Anointing</HI> that is able to teach them all Things necessary for them to know; as the blessed Apostle speaks; and they find the joys of the Holy Ghost in so doing: And I am perusaded, they are not less peaceable, sober, just, and neighbourly than formerly, and altogether as consistent with the Prosperity of civil Society; and I am sure, it is both found and confest among us here, by some Men of <HI>Quality, Learning</HI> and <HI>Vertue.</HI> Farther, be pleased to consider with your selves, that you justify the ancient Persecutions of the <HI>Christians</HI> and first Reformers, whose Superiors thought as ill of them, as you do of these Men; nay you show the Papists what to do, in their Domi∣nions, to your own Brethren. Do as you would be done by: If you would have Liberty, give it; you know that God's Witness in your Hearts dictates this to you as an immutable Law</P>
<P>Could you give Faith, it were more excusable for you to punish such as should resist; but since that is impossible, the other is unreasonable; for 'tis to afflict Men for not being what they can't be, unless they turn <HI>Hypocrites:</HI> That is the highest Pitch your coercive Power can arrive at; for never did it convert or preserve one Soul to God; instead thereof, it offers Violence unto Conscience, and puts a Man either upon the Denial of his Faith and Reason, or being destroyed for acting according to them: But what greater Disproportion can there be, than what lieth between the <HI>Intellect</HI> of Man, and <HI>Prisons, Fines,</HI> and <HI>Banish∣ments?</HI> They inform no Man's Judgment, resolve no Doubts, convince no Understanding. The Power of Persuasion is not to be found in any such barbarous Actions, no more than the Doctrine of Christianity. This Course destroys the Bodies and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">And <HI>Proper∣ty,</HI> which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repute them∣selves Guardian o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereby lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> Estates of Men, instead of saving their Souls: Were they in the wrong, it would become you to use God's Wea∣pons, his Sword of the Spirit that saveth the Creature, and slayeth the Evil in him; this Course tends to Heart-burnings and Destruction, I am sure it is no Gospel-Argument.</P>
<P>I beseech you for the sake of that Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> that suffered so patiently for his own <HI>Religion,</HI> and so sharply prohibited making other Men to <HI>Suffer</HI> for their<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that you would have a Care how you exercise Power over Men's Conscien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Con∣science is God's Throne in Man, and the Power of it his Prerogative: 'Tis to usurp his Authority, and boldly ascend his Throne, to set Lords over it. Were their Conversation scandalous, and destructive to the Good of your State, you were to be held excusable: But verily no Man of Mercy and Conscience, can defend your Practice upon poor Men so pea∣ceable and inoffensive. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> will rise up in Judgment against you, if you persevere in this Course. Do not you help to fill the Catalogue of <HI>Persecutors,</HI> in much Love I intreat you; but as becomes <HI>Christian</HI> Men and true <HI>Protestants,</HI> leave Men to their particular Per∣suasions of Affairs relative of the other World, which have no ill Aspect on the Affairs of this; but Vice hath an evil Consequence as to both: Therefore punish <HI>Vice,</HI> and affect <HI>Truth and Righteousness,</HI> and bend not your Civil Power to torment Religious Dissenters; but to retrieve good Life, lamentably lost amidst the great Pretences that are made to Religion. Doubtless <HI>Magistracy</HI> was both ordained of God, and elected by Men, to be a <HI>Terror's Evil-doers, and not to them that do well,</HI> tho' of different Judgments. You oppugn the <HI>Roman Church</HI> for assuming <HI>Infallibility</HI> to herself, and yet your own Practice maketh you guilty of the same Presumption, or worse: For, either you do exercise that Severity upon an infal∣lible Knowledge or you do not; if you do, you take that to your selves, your Princi∣ples deny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y Church whatever, which is a Contradiction; if you do not, you punish People for not conforming to what you your selves deny any Certainty about: And how do you know but you compell them to that which is false, as well as that which is true? Verily this <HI>Dilemma</HI> is not easily avoided, as well as that this inhuman Practice will stain your Profession, infame your Government, and bring a Blot upon your Posterity.</P>
<P>Remember that they are Men as well as your selves, born free, and have equal Plea to Natural and Civil common Priviledges with your selves: The different Persuasion of their Consciences about Things relating to another Life, can no ways render them unfit for this; it neither unmans nor uncivilizes them. They have the same Right to their Liberty and Property as ever, having by no Practice of theirs in the least forfeited any of those human Advantages, the Great Charters of Nature and Scripture have conferred upon them: And the <HI>Opulency</HI> of your Neighbours, and <HI>Prosperity</HI> of their Affairs, prove to you that <HI>Indul∣gence</HI> is not inconsistent with <HI>Policy;</HI> howbeit, you have now tried the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of their Pro∣cedure by what you have already inflicted, and they sustained. Let the Time past suffice, and make them not Sacrifices for their consciencious <HI>Constancy.</HI> If they are in the wrong, 'tis more than they know: Will you persecute Men for being what they must be, if they will be true to themselves? this were great Violence; rather commiserate, than thus violently compel them. I beseech you seek some cheaper Way to accommodate your selves, than by their Destruction, who are so very remote from seeking yours. <HI>Oh! the Day will come, wherein one Act of Tenderness about Matters of Conscience, shall find a better Reward, than all the Severity by which Men use to propagate their Persuasions in the World;</HI> and there is great Reason for it, since the one flows from the <HI>Saviour,</HI> the other, from the <HI>Destroyer of Men.</HI> In fine, <HI>Let your Moderation be known unto all Men, for the Lord is at hand, whose Reward is with him; and he will recompence every</HI> Man, Family, State, Kingdom, and Empire, <HI>according to</HI> the Na∣ture of <HI>their Works, committed in this mortal Body;</HI> at whose Bar it shall never be laid to your Charge, that out of Fear of taking God's Office out of his Hands, and being unmerciful to tender Consciences, you admitted Men of differing Judgments to dwell quietly among you; truly you cannot be too tender in this Point.</P>
<P>Imitate the <HI>God</HI> of Nature and Grace, by being propitious to all; <HI>his Sun shineth on all, his Rain falls on all, he gives Life and Being to all; his Grace visits all, and in Times of Ignorance he winketh:</HI> And tho' such you may repute ours, I hope you cannot think you wink at it, who make such broad Tokens of your Displeasure. Oh! How forbearing and merciful is he towards you? Have you so lately escaped the Wrath of Enemies, and can you already thus sharply treat your Friends? Had he enter'd into Judgment with you, what had become of you? Let his Goodness to you prevail with you to express Clemency to others, that so the Great God of the whole Earth, even the <HI>God of the Spirits of all Flesh, who respects not the Persons of the Rich, Poor, or Powerful in Judgment,</HI> may show you Mercy in the Day of his righteous Judgments▪ <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>After <HI>W. Penn</HI> had staid some Time at <HI>Embden,</HI> he took a Turn again to <HI>Herford,</HI> where he was received very kindly by the Princess <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Countess of <HI>Hornes;</HI> and more than once he had a Meeting in her Chamber; and the Princess was so reached and affected by his speaking,
<PB N="539" REF="003104_0550_0FEFF85D56703B70"/>
that the said, <HI>I am fully convinced; but oh my Sins are great!</HI> This gave Occasion to <HI>W. Penn</HI> to speak to the Princess and the Countess apart with Respect to their particular Conditions; which made a deep Impression on their Minds, especially the Countess's. Being much press'd by the Princess to stay and sup with her, he yielded: And the Countess from a serious Sense of her Compliance with the World, told him, <HI>Il faut que je rompe, il faut que je rompe,</HI> i. e. <HI>I must break off, I must break off.</HI> And at another Time with a weighty Countenance she cry'd out, <HI>O the Cumber and Entanglements of this vain World! They hinder all Good.</HI> Once the Princess said to him, <HI>It is a hard Matter to be faithful to what one knows. I fear that I am not weighty enough in my Spirit.</HI> At another Time she told him, <HI>Among my Books I have Records that the Gospel was by the</HI> English <HI>first brought from</HI> England <HI>into</HI> Germany; <HI>and now it is come again.</HI> Thus this excellent Princess signified how highly she valued the Preaching of the Gospel to her by <HI>W. Penn,</HI> and how much she esteemed his Labour and Ministry. When he took his Leave of these eminent Persons, ha∣ving taken the Princess by the Hand, which she received with a weighty Kindness, being much broken in Spirit, he wish'd <HI>the Blessing and Peace of Jesus with and upon her:</HI> And then exhorting the Countess, she fre∣quently beseeched him, <HI>to remember her, and implore the Lord on her Be∣half.</HI></P>
<P>Next taking Waggon for <HI>Wesel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Then he travels to <HI>Wesel, &amp;c.</HI> intending to visit the Countess of <HI>Falkenstein</HI> at <HI>Mulheim,</HI> but without seeing her; And is roughly treated by her Father.</NOTE> from thence he travelled to <HI>Duisburgh, Dusseldorp,</HI> and <HI>Cologn,</HI> and then back again to <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI> to see if he could get an Opportunity at <HI>Mulheim</HI> to speak with the Countess of <HI>Falkenstein,</HI> who was reported to be a very religious Person, and therefore in his former Journey he had endeavour'd to visit her, but in vain; for the Count of <HI>Bruch,</HI> and <HI>Falkenstein</HI> her Father, kept her as it were un∣der a Confinement, because she was of a religious Temper; and there∣fore he called her a <HI>Quaker,</HI> tho' she did not at all converse with any of the <HI>Quakers.</HI> He had also used <HI>W. Penn</HI> very roughly; when being necessitated to pass by his Castle, he being Lord of that Country, ask'd him and his Friends, <HI>From whence they were, and whither they went?</HI> To which they answered, <HI>That they were</HI> Englishmen <HI>come from</HI> Holland, <HI>and going no further in those Parts than his Town of</HI> Musheim: But they not pulling off their Hats, the Count called them <HI>Quakers,</HI> and said, <HI>We have no need of</HI> Quakers <HI>here. Get you out of my Dominion, you shall not go to my Town.</HI> And he commanded some of his Soldiers to see them out of his Territory. Thus <HI>W. Penn</HI> and those with him were necessi∣tated to lie that Night in the open Air. But the next Day he wrote a Letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Penn's Tra∣vels, <HI>page</HI> 131</NOTE> to the said Count, and therein told him, <HI>For thy saying,</HI> We want no <HI>Quakers</HI> here, <HI>I say, under Favour, you do; for a true</HI> Quaker <HI>is one that trembleth at the Word of the Lord, that worketh out his Salva∣tion with Fear and Trembling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>W. Penn</HI> now being come to <HI>Mulheim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He then goes to <HI>Duisburgh, &amp;c.</HI> And so by <HI>Utrecht</HI> to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> whither <HI>G.

F.</HI> was also come back again.</P>
<P>Here <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>G. F.</HI> had a Conference and Dispute with Dr. <HI>Ga∣lenus Abraham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>G. F.</HI> have a Dispute with Dr. <HI>G.

W. Penn</HI> wanted no Arguments to contradict this, since the Christian Religion had been once already confirmed by Miracles, and that therefore this was need∣less among Christians now. <HI>G.

<PB N="540" REF="003104_0551_0FEFF8A4EBFA29D8"/>
I well know that therein they wronged him. This Dispute was indeed a troublesome Business; for the Parties on both Sides were fain to speak by an Interpreter, which generally was performed so imperfectly that at last the Conference was broke off, without coming to a Decision, al∣tho' many weighty Arguments were objected against the Position.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Observations on the Subject of the Dispute.</NOTE> Cer∣tainly it can't be denied that <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> was sent of God to preach Repentance, and yet in Sacred Writ it is said positively, John <HI>did no Miracle; and yet many believed in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> And altho' there were some a∣mong the Prophets that wrought Miracles, yet we don't find in the holy Scriptures that <HI>Jonah,</HI> who was indeed a notable Preacher of Repen∣tance, did any Miracle, and nevertheless the <HI>Ninivites</HI> believed him, and deprecated those Judgments he denounced unless they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. Of several other true Prophets we find not the least Mention of any Mira∣cles they did;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xiii. 1, 2.</NOTE> but on the contrary the Scriptures signify, that possibly false Prophets might arise and give Signs or Wonders; and that the doing of Miracles could not always be a Proof or sure Evidence that any one was sent of God, appears plainly from what our Saviour himself said, <HI>viz.</HI> that among those to whom he should one Day say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. vii. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Depart from me,</HI> would be such that should say, <HI>Have we not in thy Name cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works?</HI> And what shall we think of the Sorcerers of <HI>Egypt?</HI> Did not they seem to do the same Wonders as <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> did? And yet those Wonders wherewithal they deceived <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Men, were in no wise wrought by a divine Power. Now since it appears plainly from the holy Scriptures, and Christ him∣self said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiv. 24.</NOTE> <HI>There shall arise false Prophets, and shall shew great Signs and Wonders,</HI> we might with good Reason suspect the Doctrine of one, who now-a-days wrought Miracles, on purpose to make what he denounced to pass for Truth. This being duly considered, it seems to be very ab∣surd, to require Miracles again for Confirmation of the same Gospel which once hath been confirmed by Miracles, and to desire that the Truth of what once hath been declared by the Apostles, and strengthned by wonderful Works, should be sealed a-new with outward Wonders. But it would indeed have been another Case, if a new Gospel was preached, and that any pretended to give forth new holy Scriptures; for then it might be said with some Reason, that it was necessary that this new Gospel should be made credible, and confirmed by visible Miracles. But where no other Gospel is preached, than what hath been once delivered to the Christians by the first Promulgators of the Christian Religion, and where this is not done amongst Heathens, but amongst Christians, or at least such as bear the Name, there it cannot in Justice be required to confirm this Doctrine once more with Miracles; the rather because, as hath been shewed already, the doing of Miracles may not always pass for an irre∣fragable Proof of One's being really pious and godly. To this may be added, that the Miracles which Christ and his Apostles wrought to give Credit to the Appearing of the Son of God in the Flesh, may be considered as Types and Figures of those spiritual Wonders which should be wrought in the Souls of People, when Christ was to be seen the second Time, and to appear by his Spirit, to the Salvation of those who wait for him; for the Eyes of the Mind being blinded, must be o∣pened and enlightened by him; and many that are dead in Sin and Tres∣passes, shall by him be raised, and made alive. This I think may suf∣fice to shew, that the Position of Dr.<HI>Galenus</HI> could not stand the Test: But whatever was objected, he continued to maintain his Opinion.</P>
<P>Not long after this Dispute,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.F.</HI> and <HI>W.P.</HI> after a violent Storm, arrive safe at <HI>Har∣wich,</HI> and so come to <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE> <HI>G.

<P><HI>G.

<P>Now since the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> were also much persecuted in <HI>Scotland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quakers</HI> perse∣cuted in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></NOTE> they drew up an Account of their Sufferings, and delivered it to the King in the Beginning of this Year; but whether they got any Ease thereby, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>In the latter Part of this Year <HI>G. F.</HI> travelled thro' many Places of <HI>England;</HI> in the mean while I'll again make some Mention of the Per∣secution there. At <HI>Plymouth</HI> about this Time those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were generally kept out of their Meeting-house; and then performing their Worship in the open Street, as a Duty they owed to God, and for the Omission of which they judged no Man could be dispensed with, they suffered exceedingly, not only in Winter by the Sharpness of the Wea∣ther,
<PB N="543" REF="003104_0554_0FEFF8636455C200"/>
but also in Summer; for it was more than twelve Months that they thus kept their Meetings in the open Street, being grievously abused by the Rabble and Soldiers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alusive beha∣viour of Rabble and Soldiers at <HI>Plymouth R.

<P>At Franchay in Glocestershire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent Behavi∣our of Justice <HI>Merideth</HI> in <HI>Glocester∣shire</HI></NOTE> the Justice <HI>John Merideth</HI> behaved him∣self exceedingly furious in disturbing of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings; for he himself did not only beat them, but more than once drew his Knife, to mark them, as he called it, had he not been restrained by his Servants, who for all That, could not prevent his taking some by the Hair of their Head, and pulling them away: Nay, the Havock and Spoil which was made was so extravagant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sufferings of</HI> T.

It happened there also, that a poor blind Widow, on her sick Bed, was visited by some Persons; and this was made a <HI>Conventicle,</HI> and they were fined, and Warrants, issued out by the aforesaid Justice to make Distress on their Goods. In many other Places Things went no better; but I may not detain my Reader with every Particular.</P>
<P>This Year died in Prison <HI>Williamu Dobson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>W.

<P>It was also in this Year that <HI>William</HI> III. Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

<P>Persecution was now very hot in many Places. At <HI>Bawnasse</HI> in <HI>West∣morland</HI> it happened that those of the Society called <HI>Quakers</HI> being re∣ligiously met together, were much abused by the rude people; and be∣sides other Insolencies that were committed, a Dog being thrown among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J.

<P>This Year the Ambassadors of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and those of the United Netherlands, with those of several other Potentates, were met at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. Baresay</HI> writes a <HI>Latin</HI> Epistle to the Ambassadors met at <HI>Nime∣guen,</HI> which, with his Apolo∣gy in <HI>Latin</HI> is delivered to each of them, &amp;c.</NOTE> to treat about a general Peace; and therefore <HI>Robert Bar∣clay</HI> writ an Epistle to them in <HI>Latin,</HI> to exhort them to this good Work. The Epistle, together with his <HI>Apology for the true Christian Divinity,</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> was delivered to each of the said Ambassadors, <HI>viz.</HI> a Book for every one of them, and one for their Principals. <HI>G. F.</HI> also writ an exhortatory Epistle to them, which being translated and print∣ed in <HI>Latin,</HI> was also sent to them. And before this Year came to an End, the Peace was concluded.</P>
<P>In the mean while Persecution went on in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> also writes to them.</NOTE> and those that were envious did not want a specious Pretence to gild their Malice; for about this Time a Plot of the <HI>Papists</HI> being discovered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Popish</HI> Plot discover'd</NOTE> there seem∣ed a Necessity to watch against seditious Assemblies; insomuch that those who had no Mind to persecute, were in a Manner constrained to it. Of which an Instance was seen in the Year 1679,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1679</NOTE> at <HI>Castle Dummington</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire:</HI> For <HI>John Evat</HI> having been fined for a Meeting at his House,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Constable,</HI> &amp;c. fined for Backwardness in taking the Goods of <HI>J.

But the Ecclesia-sticks shewed themselves the more covetous, to get what they pretended to be their Due; and one <HI>Michael Reynolds,</HI> at <HI>Farringdon</HI> in <HI>Berkshire,</HI> was this Year desp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l'd of Cattle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goods to more than the value of 971. taken from <HI>M.

<P>Thus honest Men were oppress'd, which gave Occasion to a certain Writer of that Time, (who in Print gave many Instances of that Nature)

to say, <HI>Truly the</HI> Papists <HI>may laugh because of their Victory, How they have got a Law whereby one Protestant fights against another.</HI> This was chief∣ly levelled against Conventicles; for therby many Families were impo∣verished, because often they were robb'd of thrice as much as the fine amounted to; and the basest Means that could be thought of were used to enrich the Persecutors with the Spoil of the Innocent: For it hap∣pened that four of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> travelling on the Way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Four Persons travelling on the Way have their Goods dis;trained as for a Con∣venticle.</HI></NOTE> this was deem'd a Transgres;sion, by adding a Fifth to their Number who was not of their Society. And thus the Informers (some of whom were often Whores, or Wives of Informers) made a Meeting of it, and this passed; so great was the Power of these Prosligates; and on this Ac∣count the Goods of the said four Persons were distrained. More abo∣minable Actions of that Kind I could mention, if I did not think it might seem tedious.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Encouragement given to Informers makes them ve∣ry insolent.</NOTE> Such Despoiling was permitted now to every naughty Fellow, and this made them so insolent, that one <HI>Yohn Hill,</HI> Constable at <HI>Walsingham</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> when he was shewed the Injustice of the Warrant he had, said, <HI>Justice, or no, I'll take it for all that.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Norwich</HI> liv'd one <HI>William Wat,</HI> who for several Years had carried on the Trade of Informing, but whatever he got by it turn'd to no Ac∣count; and often he was seized with such Fits of Weakness, that he could not stand on his Legs; but this Year, in <HI>October,</HI> the Hand of God fell so heavy upon him, that it put a Period to his Life. He had supp'd at Night, and was as well, according to his Wife's Relation, as ever;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sudden and re∣markable End of <HI>W.

<P>Far otherwise was the Exit of <HI>Isaac Pennington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pious Death and, ho∣nourable Inter∣ment of <HI>I.

<HEAD>Some Questions presented to the <HI>Papists,</HI> and the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> as the Supreme Head of their Church, and commended to their Consideratiou by <HI>George Fox.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW comes it to pass, that the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Cardinals</HI> grant not to the <HI>Protestants</HI> living in <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and at <HI>Rome,</HI> that Liberty of Meeting together for the right per∣formming of Divine Worship, which ye your selves enjoy in <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and other Places, where the <HI>Protestants</HI> have the chief Power?</P>
<P>Would not the <HI>Pope</HI> and his Ministers <HI>persecute,</HI> deliver to the <HI>Inquisition</HI> and <HI>been them,</HI> if they should at any Time set up as many Meetings in <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and at <HI>Rome,</HI> as ye your selves enjoy in many Places in <HI>Protestant</HI> Countries?</P>
<P>Is the Royal Law of God thus fulfilled, which teacheth, To do to all Men whatsoever we would have done to our selves? <HI>Matt.</HI> vii. 12. Would ye have those Things done to yon by Protestants, which ye have done to them? But if not; where then are the <HI>Royal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI> among you? God forbid, that we should deny <HI>Liberty</HI> to any one that ackowledgeth God, and believeth in his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. It seems therefore very strange to us, that the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> do deny the same <HI>Liberty</HI> In the pre-mention'd Places, which they themselves enjoy among the <HI>Pratestants;</HI> because it not only contrary to Reason but also to Law and Gospel: For the Apostle affirmeth, That <HI>he that was born after</HI> the Flesh personed him that was born after the <HI>Spirit,</HI> Gal. iv. 29. Have not the <HI>Papists</HI> therefore openly shewn in themselves the <HI>Fleshly Birth,</HI> which is contrary to Reason, Law and Gospel?</P>
<P N="2">2. Where did Chirst or his Apostles ever command Men to Bow themselves to Images, and to Worship them, and keep <HI>Holy-days?</HI> Where did they commmand <HI>Holy-days</HI> to be ap∣pointed in Remembrance of themselve, and the same to be <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>red?</HI> Why do ye not tell us where in the <HI>Gospels, Epistles,</HI> or in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> any such Thing was commanded those Churches, which were in the Time of the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Primitive Christians?</HI></P>
<P>Where, I say, did Christ or his Apostles give Command to Whip, Hang, or Burn Men; or, to speak as gently as may be, at least to imprison any because they dissented from them, and could not adhere to their Religion?</P>
<P N="3">3. Where ever did Christ or his Apostl;es in the primitive Churches command that <HI>Can∣dles</HI> should be lighted at Noon-day? Well, shew us where it is written, whether it be in the <HI>Gospels,</HI> or <HI>Epistles?</HI> Is not therefore the <HI>Roman Church</HI> degenerated from the Church of the primitive Times? Is she not fallen from Spiritual Weapons to Camal? Hath she not revolted from that <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Virginity,</HI> wherein she witmessed in Time past Christ to be the Head of the Churches?</P>
<P N="4">4. Did the Churches of ancient Time make Choice of a <HI>Private Man,</HI> and account him for <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Universal Church?</HI> Where ever did the Primitive Church command <HI>Infants</HI> to be <HI>sprinkled with Water?</HI> Did not Christ say, <HI>Teach all Naitions, baptizing them,</HI> &amp;c. Matt. xxviii. 19. Ought they not therefore to be taught before they were baptized? Are ye not degenerated from that Faith which Christ is the <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Finisher</HI> of, and which <HI>purisieth the Heart,</HI> and <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Victory</HI> over Sin, and Evil, which separate from God, amd by <HI>which we have Access to God,</HI> and wherewith <HI>he is well-pleased?</HI> Are ye not degenerated from the <HI>Light, Truth, Grace, Power,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> wherein the Apostles were?</P>
<P N="5">5. Have ye not degenerated from the <HI>Antient Church,</HI> because ye suffer not the People to read the Holy Scripture in their <HI>Mother-Tangue?</HI> For doth not the Apostle say, <HI>And When this Episila is read amongst you, cause that it he read also in the Church of the</HI> Laodiceans, Cal. iv. 16. and elsewhere, <HI>I charge you by the Lord, that this Epistle be rend unto all the Holy Brethren,</HI> i Thes v 27. Yea, did not Christ also say, <HI>O Fools, and slow of Heart, to believe all that the Prophets have spoken,</HI> Luke xxiv. 25.</P>
<P>How can it posibly be, that your Common People should believe those Things which Christ, the Prophets and Apostles have spoken, unless it be granted them to read or recite the same in their own Tongue, to the End they might both hear and understand them by the Spirit which gave them forth? Why then no ye take away the Use of the <HI>Holy Script∣ures</HI> from the Common People? Are ye afraid lest the Truth should appear manifest, whereby they might see and believe what is written in the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> and by Christ and his Apostles? Had not the <HI>Jews</HI> the Law and the Prophets in their <HI>Mother-Tongue,</HI> that their Children might read them? Ought not therefore all <HI>Christiams</HI> likewise to have the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> that makes mention of Christ and his Apostles, in their <HI>Mother-Tongue?</HI> But if not, why do ye not shew us where Christ and his Apostles have forhidden it?</P>
<P N="6">6. But what do ye not sey of the <HI>Saerament of the Altar</HI> (as 'tis called?) Why have ye slain many, and burnt others alive in <HI>England, France,</HI> the <HI>Law Countries,</HI> and other Places, because they could not approve or receive it? Ye assert it as a Thing certain, that the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> assoon as ye have <HI>consecrated</HI> them, are <HI>made Christ,</HI> yea <HI>whole Christ,</HI> consisting of <HI>Soul, Spirit, Flesh, Blood, and Bones.</HI> Besides, ye boldly affirm that all who receive that <HI>Sa∣crament</HI> do receive <HI>whole Christ,</HI> and that after your <HI>Conservation, that very Thing</HI> becomes <HI>Im∣mortal and Divine.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore come O <HI>Pope, Cardinals</HI> and <HI>Priests,</HI> let us take a <HI>Bottle of Wine</HI> and a <HI>Loaf of Bread,</HI> and equally divide the Wine into two Basons, and cut the Bread into two Parts: Then let the <HI>Pope, Cardinals</HI> or <HI>Prists</HI> consecrate one Part, which they please; which being done, let us lay up the <HI>Consecrated</HI> the <HI>Unconsecrated</HI> together, in some close Place, and secure the same with <HI>seven Locks</HI> and <HI>Keys</HI> on your Part, and with as many on ours, both <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> keeping <HI>Watch</HI> over it. But if it plainly appear, that the <HI>Consecrated Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> are <HI>Immortal</HI> and <HI>Divine,</HI> and lose nothing of their <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r,</HI> nor grow <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ldy</HI> or <HI>sowre,</HI> as tho they had been unconsecrated, then we will come over to you: But if they lose their <HI>Property, Quailty</HI> and <HI>Savour,</HI> and <HI>both Parts</HI> of the <HI>Bread</HI> do alike grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then It will be reasonable for you to come over to us, and confess that your <HI>Sacra∣ment of the Altar</HI> (so called) is neither <HI>Christ</HI> not his <HI>Flesh,</HI> nor any thing <HI>Immortal</HI> or <HI>Di∣vine;</HI> for his <HI>Flesh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no Corruption, Act ii. 27, 31.—xiii. 35, 37.</HI> and his <HI>precious Blood,</HI> which delivers from Sin and Corruption, cannot be corruptible.</P>
<P>Let Trial then be made hereof; but let Judgment be left to <HI>Just and Equal Arbitrators,</HI> both <HI>Papist and Protestants</HI> and that in a Place where the <HI>Prpotestants</HI> may have the same Power that ye have: For it would be unjust to make this <HI>Trial</HI> or <HI>Expertment,</HI> where ye have the whole Administration of the Commonwealth, and an equal Liberty is denied the <HI>Protestants.</HI> This Thing will make the <HI>Thurst</HI> manifest, and turn to the Honour of God: For ye have shed Blood upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>Wherefore suffer <HI>your Christ</HI> whom ye have made, to be tried, that it may be seen whe∣ther he be the <HI>True Christ,</HI> or <HI>Anticrist;</HI> whether he be the <HI>true God</HI> or a <HI>False One;</HI> For it would be somewhat hard that <HI>Bael's</HI> Prophets should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Kings xviii 13. and xix. 14, 18</NOTE> for they were willing to have <HI>thire God triad,</HI> tho' they had before slain many of the <HI>People of God,</HI> because they would not worship their God; as ye also heve often done</P>
<P>Come ye forth therefore publickly, and make Tryal; that it may appear at length to all Christendom, whether yours he the Divine and Immortal Christ and God, or no. Or is not rather that Mortal and Corruptible Christ, which ye your selves have made, and for whose Sake ye have slain Multitudes of the People of God, because they could not be∣lieve or comply with you?</P>
<P N="7">7. Further, where did Christ or his Apostles ever speak to the Saints, of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> where∣in Men should he purged from their Sins after Death? Shew us where it it written in the <HI>New-Testament.</HI> Is it not therefore a plain denying, that Christ Blood purgeth from all Sin, to tell the People a <HI>Fable</HI> of a certain <HI>Purgatory</HI> to purge them from <HI>Sins after Death?</HI> Is it not likewise a Denying of Christ's Baptism with the Holy Spirit, and of Spiritnal Cir∣cumcision, and Faith in Christ, which, purgeth in this Life, and giveth the Victory?</P>
<P>Did not Christ answer some that desired Fire might come down from Heaven and con¦sume those that would not receive him; <HI>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of?</HI> Did not he rebuke them, saying that he <HI>came not to destroy Mens Lives, but to save them?</HI> Luke ix 54, 55, 56.</P>
<P>Ye therefore who have destroyed such a vast Number of Men and Women for their Dissenting from you about <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and taken away their Lives by such kind of Instruments, Racks and Fires, as were never sent down from Heaven, but devised and invented by your selves; Are ye not worse than they, who desired Fire to he called from Heaven to destroy Mens Lives? And seeing Christ told them, that they knew not what manner of Spirit they were of, do ye know what manner of Spirit ye are of, who have devised so many Ways and Torments for the killing of Men, and havc actually made use of them.</P>
<P>With what Front ran ye persuade us to commit our Souls Bodies, and Lives to you, who know not of what Spirit ye are Children, neither have the Mind of Christ, who said, He came not to destroy Mens Lives, but to save them</P>
<P>Are ye not all, therefore, as many as take away Mem Lives for Worship devised by you, obnoxious to the Rebuke of Christ? For when did Christ or any of his Apostles ever give Command, or by their Example teach, that any one that was disobedient to them, or re∣jected their Doctrine and Rellgion, should be persecuted and imprisoned, or punished by any Carnal Weapons? Tell as where any thing of this Kind is contained, either in the four Evangelical Histories, or in the Epistles written to the Christian Churches?</P>
<P>Did ever Christ or his Apostles go to the Rope-makers to buy Whips and Halters, to whip and hang Men for dissenting from them, as ye have done? Did they ever go to the Blacksmiths to make Chains, Fetters, Bolts and Locks? Or to the Gunsmiths to buy Guns and Musket? or to the Sword-cutlers, to buy Swords or Halberts? Did they ever build Prisons, or get Holes and Vaults dug, to sorce Men by such Means to their Religion? Shew us an Example and Precept given by Christ or his Apostles, which commands and makes the Use of such Weapons and Instruments lawful.</P>
<P>But if ye cannot make Proof thereof, it is necessary for you to confess and acknowledge, that ye are fallen and degenerated from the true Christian Weapons, which the Apostles and Primitive Christians used, saying, <HI>The Weapons of our Warfare not Carnal, but mighty thro' God,</HI> that it.

Burr</HI> dwelt) <HI>appear not at</HI> Nor∣wich, <HI>and therefore they are not in Being.</HI> Now tho' they shewed the Absurdity of this strange Kind of <HI>Logick,</HI> yet <HI>Bacon</HI> would not hearken to it, but called them <HI>Seducers</HI> and <HI>Seditious,</HI> and told them, there was a <HI>Statute yet in Force, that was made in Queen</HI> Elizabeth's <HI>Days, to hang such Persons as they were.</HI> And they asking him, <HI>If he could prosecute them upon that Law, or execute it upon them?</HI> He answered, <HI>Yes, if the King should give Order to have it put in Execution, I would do it, and have you hang'd, if you would not abjure the Realm.</HI> From this it may appear what a violent Man this Recorder was, and that the Prisoners could not expect any good Treatment from him. So Night being come, he sent them to the jail. About a Month after, at the Quarter-Sessions, they
<PB N="549" REF="003104_0560_0FEFF869CE31CDE8"/>
were called into the Court of Judicature to be tried; and being brought to the Bar, <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> said; <HI>We have been five Hecks in Prison; 'tis meet the Court should know for what; pray let our</HI> Mittimus <HI>be produced.</HI> But the Recorder, who sat as Judge in the Court, said, <HI>There's no need of your</HI> Mittimus <HI>to be read here: I'll give an Account of the Cause.</HI> And then he told the Court, <Q>How they had gathered together a Company of about two Hundred, and that Officers went from him to dissipate them, but could not; that thereupon he sent the Sheriff, who took them away; and that they being brought before him, he proffered them, if they would pay their Fines, he would not commit them; and that they refusing, he tendered the Oath of Allegiance to them; which they not willing to take, he sent them to Jail.</Q> And tho' <HI>G. White∣head</HI> with good Reason said, That <HI>they being</HI> Englishmen, <HI>had a Right to travel in any Part of the Nation:</HI> And <HI>T. Burr</HI> added, That <HI>he being a Person that was concerned in trading in Corn, by the Law of</HI> England <HI>he might travel from Place to Place about his Concerns;</HI> yet this so displeased the Recorder, that he said, <HI>Had not you better have been turning your Malt at home, than to come here to preach? The Scripture says,</HI> God ad∣ded to the Church such as should be saved, <HI>but ye draw from the Church: And,</HI> said he farther, <HI>the Church of</HI> England <HI>will never be at quiet, till some of you be hang'd. G. Whitehead</HI> then shewing how unreasonably the Recorder behaved himself, and that a Judge ought not thus to inveigh against the Prisoners, and threaten them, alledged to that End a nota∣ble Instance, how in the Case of <HI>Humphry Stafford,</HI> an Arch-Traitor, the Chief Justice <HI>Hussey</HI> had been unwilling (in Compliance with the King's Desire) to declare his Opinion concerning him before he was judicially proceeded against. The Recorder then asked, <HI>What King's Reign was that in? In King</HI> Henry VII's. replied <HI>G. Whitehead. I perceive you are read,</HI> returned the Recorder. And so he was indeed; and he defended his Cause so well in the Court, that the Magistrates seemed at a Loss; for he shewed so evidently that he was unjustly committed to Prison, that the Mayor (to whom, and to the Justices he had appealed) said, <HI>You have appealed to me; truly we are Tradesmen, and no Lawyers: We leave Matters of Law to the Recorder; he knows the Law, and we must acquiesce in his Judgement.</HI> If I should repeat here all that was spoken <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>contra,</HI> so as I find it extant, I should be fain to be almost as large as I have been in the Relation of the Tri∣als of <HI>John Crook</HI> and <HI>William Penn:</HI> And therefore I'll only say brief∣ly, that after much Reasoning, the Recorder tendered the Oath of Allegiance again to them, that so by their Refusal he might get Occa∣sion to premunire them. But this Recorder, before the whole Process came to an End, being turned out by the Magistrates, it did not come to that Pitch; tho' it was a good while yet before the aforesaid <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> and <HI>T. Burr</HI> were released, after they had shewn the Illega∣lity of their Commitment; first, by more than one Warrant from the Recorder, and afterward, to colour the Error the better, by an Or∣der from the Quarter-Sessions.</P>

<P>IT is our Principle and Testimony,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

His Labour seemed not altogether ineffectual with the Par∣liament, for about the Beginning of the Year 1681,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681</NOTE> the House of Com∣mons resolved,</P>
<P>That it is the Opinion of the House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolution of the House of com∣mons against ex∣ecuting the penal Laws against Dissenters.

<P>But tho' the House of Commons came to this Resolution, yet it did not stop Persecution; for as long as the Laws (by Virtue whereof they persecuted) were not repealed, which could not be done without the Concurrence of the House of Lords and the King, those that were ma∣licious continued in their old Way, which lasted yet three or four Years.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> now also came into some Trouble;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

Of this <HI>G. F.</HI> had Certificates; but since they would not accept them without an Oath, it made his Case the more difficult. He proposed the Mat∣ter to four Judges at <HI>London,</HI> and found one more moderate than the other, which put a Stop to what her Enemies designed. And the Judges wondred when they heard that he had made Promise in Writing, not to meddle with his Wife's Estate.</P>
<P><PB N="551" REF="003104_0562_0FEFF86D5CD8E340"/>This Year the King dissolved the Parliament, and called a new One to sit at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and so it did; but for all That he could not make it comply with his Demands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament dis∣solved and a new one sits at <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> which is also dissolved.

<P>It was also in this Year that the King gave a Country or great Tract of Land in <HI>America</HI> to <HI>William Penn,</HI> with a Patent under the great Seal, to him and his Heirs <HI>in perpet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um,</HI> since the King owed him still a con∣siderable Sum for the Services of his Father the Admiral Sir <HI>William Penn.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> grants a large Tract of Land in <HI>A∣merica</HI> to <HI>W. Penn</HI> and to his Heirs, and gives it the Name of <HI>Penn∣sylvania.</HI></NOTE> This Tract of Land on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> from the fortieth Degree to the three and fortieth, with all the Isles belonging to it, the King gave to <HI>W. Penn,</HI> with full Power to erect a new Colony there, to sell Lands, to create Magistrates, to make Laws not contrary to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and Power to pardon Crimes; And in the Patent the King declared that this Tract of Land henceforth should bear the Name of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> This Favour of the King <HI>W. Penn</HI> chiefly owed (I think) to <HI>James,</HI> then Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who being Chief Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>William Penn,</HI> the Father, on his dying Bed desired him to protect his Son against his Enemies, who, because of his Religion, were like to fall hard upon him. This the Duke promised, and stood also to his Promise; and therefore it was not without Reason that <HI>W. Penn</HI> afterwards, when the said Duke had ascended the Throne, shew∣ed himself ready to be serviceable to him in all that he thought might be beneficial to the Kingdom. <HI>W. Penn</HI> now went with much Compa∣ny to <HI>America,</HI> and having seen the Land given him, he founded there the chief City <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and some other Towns. And that he might the more peaceably enjoy the Country, he purchased from the <HI>Indians</HI> so much Land, that he became the Proprietor of a Country twice as big as all the United Provinces, as he himself once told me: And this Colony encreased so suddenly, that after a few Years, at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> there were built six hundred Brick Houses. <HI>W. Penn</HI>'s Father was de∣ceased long before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dying Ad∣vice and Senti∣ments of Sir <HI>W.

He complained much of the Wickedness of the Times, and was heard at sundry Times to say, <HI>Wo to thee, O</HI> England! <HI>God will judge thee, O</HI> England! <HI>Great Plagues are at thy Door, O</HI> England! He also said, <HI>God hath forsaken us. We are infatuated; we will shut our Eyes. We will not see our true Interest and Happiness: We shall be destroyed.</HI> When he was near to Death, and took his Leave of his Relations, he said to <HI>W. Penn, Son</HI> William, <HI>if you and your Friends keep to your plain Way of Preaching, and keep to your plain Way of Living, you will make an End of the Priests to the End of the World. Bury me by my Mother, live all in Love, shun all Manner of Evil; and I pray God to bless you all; and he will bless you.</HI> Thus died the valiant Admiral <HI>Penn,</HI> Father of <HI>William Penn,</HI> Proprietor of <HI>Pennsylvania:</HI> And now I return to other Matters.</P>
<P>I left <HI>G. Fox</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and since he continued there and thereabout a good while, I'll take a Turn to <HI>Bristol,</HI> where in the Year 1682,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1682</HI> Dismal Perse∣cution at <HI>Bri∣stol.</HI></NOTE> a dismal Scene of Persecution was opened: For the Meetings of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> were disturbed, not only by grievously abusing, and im∣prisoning them; but they were also vex'd by breaking into their Hou∣ses, and committing all manner of Violence, as among the rest in the House of <HI>Richard Marsh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Instanced in <HI>R. Marsh,</HI> Mer∣chant.</NOTE> an eminent Merchant in that City: For, to get of him the Fine that was pretended, first a Cask of Wine worth twenty Pounds, was taken and sold for four Pounds; as often it happen'd, that
<PB N="552" REF="003104_0563_0FEFF8B5217ABD60"/>
the Goods thus taken, were sold for less than the half, because honest People being unwilling to buy such Goods, they were sold to any one that would but bid some Money, how little soever: For what was wanting of the Fine was taken a-new from the fined Person, and so they did here also; for they broke open his Compting-house, sought for Mo∣ney, and took away his Leidger, Journal, Cash-book, and other Books and Accounts, besides many Houshold-Goods; and several Chambers were rifled, tho' the Wife of the said <HI>Marsh</HI> lay in Child-bed at that Time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And carried on chiefly by She∣riff <HI>Knight, J Helliar</HI> an Attorney, with their Accompli∣ces <HI>Lugg, Til∣ley, Casse, Pa∣trick, Hoar, Watkins,</HI> In∣formers.</NOTE> The chief Actors of these Insolencies were the Sheriff <HI>John Knight,</HI> and <HI>John Helliar</HI> an Attorney, who with his Companions <HI>Lugg, Tilley, Casse, Patrick, Hoar</HI> and <HI>Watkins,</HI> served for Informers. <HI>Knight</HI> and <HI>Helliar</HI> came frequently with a Multitude of Boys and rude Rabble, to disturb the Meetings of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and then they carried them to the Prisons, which grew so full, that about fifty Persons were crouded into one Room, which was so nasty, that one of the Aldermen, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Cann</HI> said, <HI>If he had a Dog which he loved, he would not put him there.</HI> And tho' Sir <HI>Thomas Earl,</HI> Mayor of the City, and some Justices and Aldermen, at the Request of others, shewed themselves inclined to allow the Prisoners a better Place, yet the Power of the a∣foresaid Sheriff <HI>John Knight</HI> was such, that he hindred it.</P>
<P>The Meetings of other Protestant Dissenters were disturbed now al∣so, but they fainted and gave way;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Dissen∣ters disturbed, but give way.</NOTE> whereas the <HI>Quakers</HI> stood firm, how much soever vexed; which often was done in a very outragious Manner: For their Meetings were not only disturbed often with the Noise of Drums and Fiddles, but Liberty was given to the vilest Fellows to commit all kind of Insolency, without shewing any Regard to those of the Female Sex, whose Hoods and Scarffs were torn; and <HI>Helliar,</HI> to give the Boys a Sign to attack the Women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vile Practices of <HI>Helliar.</HI></NOTE> was us'd to say to these, <HI>Have a Care of your Hoods and Scarffs;</HI> for then the Boys fell upon them; and both aged Women and ancient Men were carried to Prison, and forced to go faster than they well could, by pushing them, and pinch∣ing their Arms black and blue; and when once a Girl spoke a Word a∣gainst this Cruelty, she was pull'd by the Hair, and haled to Prison; nay little Boys were beaten on the Head till they grew giddy, and then they were carried to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> where <HI>Helliar</HI> charged the Keeper <HI>to get a new Cat of nine Tails,</HI> endeavouring to terrify the Children, by making them believe they should be whipt, unless they would promise to come no more to Meetings: But this succeeded not; for his extrava∣gant Malice did not subdue the Constancy of these Children.</P>
<P>With such Diabolical Rage they persecuted this People at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and not a Stone was left unturn'd to afflict them. Once they were nailed up in their Meeting-house, and thus kept about six hours; which could not but be very hard to Nature, since there were also Women of no mean Families, and among these the Widow of the Upper-Sheriff <HI>Lane.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jails fill'd.</NOTE> So many also were taken Prisoners, that at length there was no more Room in the Jails. By these Proceedings many Families were ruined: For their Goods were taken from them, not only on the Ac∣count of Meeting, but when any were believed to be of good Estates, the Oath of Allegiance was tendered to them. At Court it seems they were the more offended against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> because in the Election of Members of Parliament, some had voted for such as they believed to be moderate, and no Favourers of Popery; and therefore it was said un∣derhand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">'Tis insinuated, to stay persecu∣ting the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> if they for∣bear voting for Parliament-Men</NOTE> <HI>That if Mr.</HI> Penn <HI>and Mr.</HI> Whitehead <HI>would undertake for the</HI> Quakers <HI>not to vote at Elections of Parliament-men, there should be no further Persecution of them.</HI> In the mean while the Behaviour of the Persecutors in the Meetings was brutish in the highest Degree; inso∣much that a certain Woman, seeing that the Attorney <HI>Helliar</HI> listed up
<PB N="553" REF="003104_0564_0FEFF8709FA07B38"/>
her Child by the Hair of his Head, and asking him, <HI>Why he so abused her Child,</HI> was therefore ill treated herself by him. And by Order of the said <HI>Helliar</HI> a Lass was committed to <HI>Bridewel,</HI> because she gave an impudent Boy, that would have turned up her Coats, a Box on the Ear; for which defending of her Modesty, this brutish <HI>Helliar</HI> called her a Rioter and seditious Person: For he was, as hath been said already, a Leader of insolent and saucy Boys, which he from Time to Time took along with him to disturb the Meetings of the <HI>Quakers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Instan∣ces of <HI>Knight</HI>'s and <HI>Helliar</HI>'s Behaviour.</NOTE> And Sheriff <HI>Knight</HI> did often with his Cane very violently beat those that were met together, and once grievously abused an ancient Man called <HI>Britton;</HI> and some Women were pinched violently in their Arms. <HI>Susannah York,</HI> an aged Woman, was thrown down to the Ground; <HI>Mary Hooper</HI> was very roughly handled by <HI>Helliar,</HI> had her Scarf torn off her Back, and was so thrust and flung about, that she was much out of Order long af∣ter; and <HI>Mary Page,</HI> being big with Child, was so violently haled out of the Meeting, that her Life was endangered by it. With <HI>Helliar</HI> it became customary to call Men Rogues, and the Women Whores, Jades, Carrions, and damn'd Bitches: He also bid the Boys to tear their Scarfs, and take up Dirt, and throw it upon them. Of this his Beastly Rage there were many Witnesses; for these abominable Dealings displeased many People of other Persuasions: But it seems these enraged Fellows had Encouragement at Court, whereon they durst rely: For the Sheriff <HI>John Knight</HI> was knighted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Doings encouraged at Court, and Sheriff <HI>Knight</HI> knighted.</NOTE> and thereby grew more insolent. Once it happened that <HI>Helliar</HI> having disturbed a Meeting, drove the Women along the Streets as if they had been Cattle; and being asked, <HI>Whether he made Beasts of them?</HI> He answered, <HI>Ye are worse than Beasts, for Beasts will be driven, but you will not.</HI></P>
<P>This disturbing or Meetings continued till almost all the Men belong∣ing thereto were clapt up in Prison; and some of them sending a Peti∣tion to the Mayor and Justices of the City, that they might be plea∣sed to let them have larger Rooms, since not only their Health, but their Lives also were endangered, the said Magistrates shewed them∣selves inclined to allow the Prisoners some Ease or Enlargement: But the Power of Sheriff <HI>Knight</HI> was such, that whatever they said or did, all proved in vain. The Mayor also signified to the Sheriff, <Q>That he would have all Convictions made above-board, and not in Ale∣houses and Taverns; and that he would have the distrained Goods brought into a publick Warehouse, and not in a By-lane.</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hereupon he slights the Ma∣yor, and forces his Compliance.</NOTE> But tho' the Mayor <HI>ex officio</HI> might have commanded the Sheriff, yet this Of∣ficer was so countenanced, that he did not care for whatever the Mayor said; nay, so exorbitant was he, that his Adherents began to threaten the Mayor he should not be a Parliament-man; insomuch that he was forced to comply in some Degree. In the mean while the Havock and Spoil was so enormous, that generally twice as much was taken as the Fine amounted to.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Severity of <HI>J.

for Rest, it had a ready Tendency to breed infectious Distempers, to the endangering of their Lives, <HI>&amp;c.,</HI></Q> But all this did not avail them, it being not counted worth the while to be concerned for them. Nay, so desperately wicked was the Jailor, that when the Prisoners com∣plained for want of Room, he said to his Man, <HI>If he could but shut the Door, it would be well enough.</HI> But in due Time we shall see what An∣guish and Horror befel him.</P>
<P>After most of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> at <HI>Bristol</HI> were in Prison,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Most of the <HI>Quakers</HI> at <HI>Bristol</HI> impri∣soned.</NOTE> the Women who continued to keep up their Religious Meetings, were also seized, and confined to that Degree, that at length few or none but Children, that staid with the Servants in the Houses of their Pa∣rents, were left free. The Number of the Prisoners for the Sake of their Religion amounted now to one Hundred and fifteen, and some of them were confin'd in <HI>Bridewel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. Blaugdone <HI>and</HI> K.

It is very remarkable that Children under sixteen Years of Age now performed what their Parents were hindred from: For these Children kept up their Religious Meetings as much as was in their Power.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meetings kept up by Children, of whom <HI>19</HI> are sent to the House of Correction.</NOTE> But tho' they were not within the Reach of the Law, yet once nine∣teen of these Youths were taken and carried to the House of Correction, where they were kept for some Time. And tho' they were threatned with Whipping if ever they returned to the Meeting, yet they con∣tinued valiant without fainting, altho' they suffered exceedingly from the wicked Rabble. But so great was their Zeal, that they despising all Reproach and Insolence, remained stedfast; and thus they shewed in spight of their Enemies, that God would not suffer that the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> Meeting should be altogether suppress'd, as it was intended. This Persecution continued till the next Year, as it did in several other Places also; for there wanted no Informers, who continually lay in wait for Prey even to such a Degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Market-people at their Inn sworn against for a Meeting.</NOTE> that I find that some of those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> being come from other Places to a Market, and being gone into an Inn to refresh themselves, a snatching Informer did not stick to declare upon his Oath, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> had kept a Meeting there.</P>
<P>But before I leave <HI>Bristol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Case of <HI>E.

With this the Court seemed satisfied; and the Bishop of <HI>Bristol</HI> seeing these Apish Tricks, told the Court, <HI>That altered it not from being an Oath,</HI> at which they gloried, as having obtained a Conquest. But this was but a pitiful one; for <HI>Erasmus</HI> being a Man of an irregular Life, the <HI>Quakers</HI> had but little Cause to regret the Loss of such a Member, who grew so dissolute, that in Process of Time they found themselves necessitated to deny him, because of his offensive Conversation.</P>

The Devil is yet in her, and we will squeeze him out.</HI> These cruel Abuses made a neighbourly Woman cry out, <HI>What will you kill the Wo∣man?</HI> To which the Boys said, <HI>What care we? Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>bid us do so. Did he indeed?</HI> ask'd the Woman. <HI>Ay indeed,</HI> replied the Boys. <HI>Then,</HI> said she, <HI>he may be ashamed of it.</HI> Thus these Boys openly said, that it was the Parson (viz. <HI>William Cotton,</HI> who was Priest of the Parish) en∣couraged them to this excessive Wickedness, and his Man said in plain Terms, <HI>His Master was one of the best Men in</HI> England; <HI>for if every one would serve them so, this Heresy would be rooted out.</HI> And this Man whose Name was <HI>Thomas Ambrose,</HI> did not stick to say, <HI>That nothing would drive the</HI> Quakers <HI>away, but either Fire or Water; and if the House was his</HI> (meaning the House where they met together) <HI>he would burn it on their Heads.</HI> More Instances of such exorbitant Wickedness happen'd at sundry Places I could mention, if I did not study Brevity.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> being this Year at <HI>London</HI> about the Time of choosing new Sheriffs for the City, he writ a few Lines to those who standing Can∣didates for that Office, desired his Friends to give their Voices for them. And he said in the Conclusion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F</HI>'s Terms for his Friends Voices at Elec∣tions</NOTE> <HI>Shall we be free to serve and worship God, and keep his Commands, if we give our Voices for you? For we are unwil∣ling to give our Voices for such as will imprison and persecute us, and spoil our Goods.</HI> The Constables now at <HI>London</HI> were sent sometimes with Warrants to disturb the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings; but it was easily seen that they would rather have been freed from such a Commission: For co∣ming there, they would bid <HI>G. F.</HI> or others that preached, <HI>to give over speaking;</HI> but they and the Soldiers who sometimes came along with them, generally behaved themselves moderate, sufficiently shewing that they were not for Persecution, and that what they did was for the sake of their Office. Sometimes indeed they hindered the Friends going into their Meetings; but these then being thus kept out, the Number notwithstanding increased.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Service <HI>G. F.</HI> had, be∣ing kept out of <HI>Devonshire-house</HI> Meeting</NOTE> Once it happen'd that <HI>G. Fox</HI> was stopp'd by the Constables from going into <HI>Devonshire-house</HI> Meeting; and after having stood a while in the Yard, till he was weary, one gave him a Stool to sit on; after a while he stood up and preach'd, and in his Declaration said, <HI>Ye need not come against us with Swords and Staves, for we are a peaceable People, and have nothing in our Hearts but Good∣will to the King and Magistrates, and to all People upon the Earth. And we do not meet under Pretence of Religion to plot against the Government, or to raise Insurrections, but to worship God in Spirit and in Truth.</HI> When he had spoken what was upon him at that Time, he sat down, and after a while concluded the Meeting with Prayer, at which the Consta∣bles and Soldiers, as well as others, put off their Hats; and when the Meeting was finished, a Constable putting off his Hat, seriously said, <HI>The Lord bless you;</HI> and all were suffered to pass away unmolested.</P>
<P>Thus this Year came to an End: All other Protestant Dissenters were now suppress'd: For they were restrained from exercising any publick Worship;<NOTE PLACE="marg">When other Dissenters were s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, their Persecutors have said the <HI>Quakers</HI> could not be ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rpa∣ted</NOTE> and some there were who in their Nocturnal Meet∣ings would pray God, <HI>That it might please him to keep the</HI> Quakers <HI>sted∣fast, that so they might be as a Wall about them, in order that other Dis∣senters might not be rooted out.</HI> And yet these, to render the <HI>Quakers</HI> odious, formerly had been very active in setting them forth in very ill Colours.

<HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>could not be overcome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1683</NOTE> and that the Devil himself could not extirpate them.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1683 Persecution continued in many Places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Above <HI>700 Quakers</HI> in Prison. Persecution still in <HI>Leicester∣shire, Nor∣thampton∣shire,</HI> &amp;c.

Some of the Prisoners being Tradesmen, would willingly have work'd in Prison, to earn something for their Sustenance; but the Jailor <HI>Isaac Dennis</HI> would not permit them that Liberty. Other Prisoners fell sick of the Spotted Fever, and some died of it; yet all this did not soften the said hard∣hearted Jailor. But at length a heavy Stroke from Heaven fell upon him. About the Middle of the Month <HI>October</HI> he fell sick, and was seized with a terrible Anguish of Mind. Then he wish'd <HI>he had never seen the Inside of the Jail;</HI> and he desired some of the <HI>Quakers, to pray for him, and to forgive him for what he had done.</HI> To which they answer∣ed, <HI>That they forgave him; but he should ask Forgiveness of God.</HI> But still his Anguish increased; and when the Physicians order'd him to be let Blood, he said, <HI>No Physick would do him Good, his Distemper being ano∣ther Thing; and that no Man could do him Good, his Day being over; and there was no Hope of Mercy from God for him.</HI> Some of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> seeing him in this woful Condition, signified, that <HI>they desired if it was the Will of the Lord, he might find a Place of Repentance.</HI> And it was told him, <HI>They hoped his Day was not over, because he had such a full Sense of his Condition:</HI> To which he answered, <HI>I thank you for your good Hope; but I have no Faith to believe.</HI> And he further said, <HI>Faith is the Gift of God.</HI> Whatever was spoken to him, he continued in saying, <HI>That his Day was over, and there was no Mercy for him.</HI> Such a gnaw∣ing Worm is the Guilt of Conscience; and in this desperate State he continued above a Month, and died the last of <HI>November,</HI> without any visible Signs of Forgiveness; but the Judgment thereof we must com∣mit to God.</P>
<P>Altho' the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> were oppress'd by Sufferings all o∣ver the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> and other Teachers encourage to Faithfulness and Perseve∣rance. And 'tis re∣markable these Teachers gene∣ally went free, which was the Case of <HI>C. Marshal.</HI></NOTE> yet generally they continued valiant; and as <HI>G. Fox</HI> did not omit from Time to Time to encourage them by Letters to Faithful∣ness and Stedfastness, so several others of their Teachers did not neg∣lect to exhort them to Perseverance both by Word and Writing, and what was indeed remarkable, those who travelled to and fro in the Country, and publickly preached in the Meetings of their Friends, ge∣nerally went free; and the Informers were often disappointed of catching a Preacher. I find it left upon Record by <HI>Charles Marshal,</HI> who was none of the least, that tho' in the Time when Persecution was most hot, he travelled thro' the Nation, yet none laid Hands on him, or fined him for his Preaching; which was the more remarkable, because he being a very zealous Man, was used to lift up his Voice in a very powerful Manner.</P>
<P><HI>William Dewsbury,</HI> who was now grown ancient in his Imprisonment at <HI>Warwick,</HI> had writ an Epistle of Consolation to his suffering Friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich was thought fit to be reprinted, and is as follows:</P>

<PB N="557" REF="003104_0568_0FEFF877856CD310"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brethren and Sisters,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEar the Word of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Dewsbu∣ry</HI>'s Letter of Consolation to his oppressed Friends.</NOTE> Thus saith the Lord, Tho' you now drink the Cup of Adversity, and cat the Bread of Affliction, and are trampled upon, as tho' you were not worthy to live upon the Earth, yet not∣withstanding all the Fury of Men, you are resolved in the Strength of my Spirit for ever to be deprived of the sweet Enjoyments of Wife, Husband, tender Children, Parents, and outward Possessions, Liberty and Life, before you deny the Testimony of my Name before the Sons of Men. Oh! you dear and tender Children, who love not your Lives unto Death this Day, that you may finish a good Testimony for the Glory of my Name, saith the Lord God; list up your Heads in the Light of my Covenant, and believe in my Name, for I am near unto you, saith the mighty God of Safe∣ty; and let not any Weight or Burthen lie upon you; for I will be more than Husband to Wife, and more than Wife to Husband, or Parents to Children, or Children to Parents; yea, I will be a Husband to the Wi∣dow, and a Father to the Children who are deprived of their tender Pa∣rents for my Name-sake: I will enlarge your Borders in the Life of my Righteousness; you that suffer in true Innocency, will I refresh with the Depth of my Mercies; yea I will guard you with the Angel of my Pre∣sence, and all that devise Mischief against you shall be confounded before the Glory of my Power, with which I will keep and preserve you in the Word of my Patience, and Safety, in my Presence, saith the Lord God.</P>
<P>Therefore, you dear Children, who drink the deepest in Sufferings, think it not hard, for it is my Purpose unto you all that have not any Eye to Self, but alone seek my Glory in all you do; I will make you more and more Ho∣nourable in the Glory of my Life, and double my Blessings upon you and yours; for I have beheld your Integrity, and my Bowels are mightily moved with Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assion towards you; therefore am I risen for your Sakes this Day, to declare unto you, my suffering People, That not an Hair of your Head shall perish, neither shall you be detained in Prisons and desolate Holes any longer than I have determined shall be for your eternal Good, and the Glory of my Name for ever; Therefore in my Life stand faithful, in Resistance of every evil Thought, or whatever would cause you to mur∣mur, or desire any thing but what you know will advance the Glory of my Name, and the Exaltation of my Truth, over all that riseth up against it, in your being truly subject to the Measure of my Light and Life, that will not let any seek a Pre-eminence or Esteem amongst Men; neither let Self-striving nor Self-serving have Power in any; but in true Humility, Love and Meekness watch one over another; and let the Strong take the Weak by the Hand, that you may all gently in Love, Meekness, and holy Fear dread my Name, and serve one another, that your Love may be ma∣nifest unto me, saith the Lord your God, and one unto another in the naked Simplicity of your Spirits; then will I make my Dwelling amongst you, and with you; and my dreadful and glorious Presence you shall all feel mightily in you and amongst you, moving in the Exercise of my Spirit, to the Renown of my Name, and the Comfort of one another; and I will crown yon with heavenly Blessings, and the Glory of my powerful Life; and you shall praise my Name for ever that I made you my Jewels, and counted you worthy to suffer for the Testimony of my Name. I will go be∣fore you thro' all the Waters and Floods of Affilictions; and, I will appear with you before all the Counsels of the Sons of Men; and my saving Power shall compass you about in your hot and sharp Afflictions, all you who have your Confidence alone in me, the LORD your GOD. Therefore trust in my Name, ye my dear Children, and cast all your Care upon me; and if any of you joyfully suffer the Spoiling of your Goods, I will supply with what is needful for you and yours; and if any of you seal your Testimony in the Word of my Patience with your Blood, I will take Care of your tender

Wives and Children, or Parents, so whom your Souls have been poured forth in Prayers unto me for their Good.</P>
<P>Therefore hear my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord which is sounded unto you from the Throne of my Grace and eternal Glory: Rejoice not too much in Spirits being made subject, but throw down your Crowns before me, that there be not a self-seeking self-serving Spirit in the Family of my People, but all feel the Birth-immortal raised up in the Resurrection of my Life in you all, which truly makes Self of no Reputation, so that all Loftiness be laid low, and all Haughtiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owed down in every one, that I the Lord God in you all may be loved, obeyed, and exalted; who is taking, and will take to me my great Power, to exalt the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k upon the Earth, and reign over all the Pride of the Children of Men, (that is exalted above my Witness in their Conscience) that so my Sons may be brought from far, and my Daughters from the Ends of the Earth, in the Sight of all People, whom I will make to confess, in Subjection to my Power, That you are the beloved People of the most high God, and of the righteous Seed which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord hath blessed; and not any Weapon formed against you shall prosper, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come to nought, which will be hastned for your Comforts, and certainly performed according to what is here declared, to your eternal Joy; and you shall assuredly know the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</P>
<P>The Word of the Lord before expressed, came to me in the Prison∣house in <HI>Warwick,</HI> the 13th Day of the first Month, 1664, which constrained me to send it to be read amongst you, dear, faithful, and suffering People of the Almighty God, in whom I remain your Brother and Companion in Tribulation and Kingdom of Patience in the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>Whilst Persecution was on foot in <HI>England,</HI> there was some Division among those called <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise and Progress of <HI>Wilkinson &amp; Story</HI>'s Sepa∣ration, the pre∣tended Occasion, and of whom it chiefly consisted.</NOTE> which had its Rise some Years before. Those who first appeared to head it, were <HI>John Wilkinson</HI> and <HI>John Story,</HI> Preachers among them, who shewed themselves discontented a∣gainst <HI>G. F.</HI> chiefly about the Management of Church-affairs, because Things went not always so as they would have it: And since <HI>G. F.</HI> had been the first Institutor of good Order amongst his Friends, he was the chief Object of the Envy of the Male-con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted. And because in the Beginning there were no such Meetings, or Discipline, and yet they had lived in mutual Peace and Unity, it was asserted, <Q>That such Meetings were needless, and that every one ought to be guided by the Spirit of God in his own Mind, and not to be governed by Rules of Man.</Q> By which it appeared that they were against the establish∣ing any Order of Government in the Church. But they were greatly bent against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Women's Meetings, who as Deaconesses met together at set Times, to provide for poor Families, and sick People that were in want. It is true, it was objected that in those Meetings sometimes was debated what was not so convenient in every respect, because young Women were admitted there also, to see and learn how Matters were treated by the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave and ancient Women: And what if some had been a little too forward to meddle with Affairs properly belonging to the Men? the creepi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g in of a wrong Use can by no Means justify the abrogating what is really <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eful; and that honest and ancient Women took Care for the poor and indigent Members of the Church was indeed laudable. But as in great Communities generally are sound some Men who love to govern, without being fit for it; so some of these soon adhered to <HI>Wil∣kinson</HI> and <HI>Story,</HI> besides several others, who in Time of Persecution, ra∣ther would have met privately, than come into publick Meetings, and
<PB N="559" REF="003104_0570_0FEFF879240ECA08"/>
so be expose'd to the Fury of their Enemies; and such also as rather would pay Tythes to the Priests, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than suffer Spoil or Imprison∣ment for the Refusal thereof.</P>
<P>Hence rose a Schism or Rent first in the North of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Appeared first in the North of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> and some who went under the Denomination of <HI>Separatists,</HI> began to keep Meet∣ings by themselves, and so to leave their former Friends, tho' they pre∣tended to agree with them in Matter of Doctrine. To these Separatists afterwards resorted such as were not strict Livers, and therefore were un∣willing to submit to Church-discipline: For this was now become the common Saying of these People, <HI>That every one having received a Mea∣sure of the Spirit of God, ought to regard that Leader, without minding any Rules prescribed by others.</HI></P>
<P>In Process of Time <HI>William Rogers</HI> and <HI>Thomas Crisp</HI> appeared in pub∣lick Print against their <HI>quondam</HI> Brethren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Afterwards <HI>W. Rogers</HI> and <HI>T. Crisp</HI> print against their former Brethren.</NOTE> and upbraided them with every imprudent Behaviour, or inconsiderate Act; besides that, on meer Hear-say they published a multitude of Untruths, and decry'd even lawful Things; an Instance of which appeared when <HI>Rogers</HI> scornfully reviled them in paultry Verses, That some Sustenance had been given from the publick Cash to indigent Preachers, who, to shun the Neglect of their publick Ministry, could not duly mind their private Affairs; tho' this Supply never exceeded necessary Provision. To this it was an∣swered, That if it pleased God to call to his Ministry Persons of mean Estate, the Church was not warranted to hinder it, and let such suffer Want; since he, as Sovereign of the Universe, could not be limited in the Distribution of his Gifts. <HI>Rogers</HI> would continually appeal to the primitive Times, and to give some Colour to what they asserted, he and his Adherents published a Paper, with <HI>Edward Burroughs</HI>'s Name to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And father on <HI>E Burroughs</HI> what <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> gives good Proof was writ by <HI>J. Perrot.</HI> The Separation spreads, and <HI>C. Harris</HI> ap∣pears among them.</NOTE> who had been dead above twenty Years; but <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> and others gave good Proofs, that that Apostate <HI>John Perrot</HI> had been the Author of that so much applauded Paper. At length this Rent appeared also in <HI>London,</HI> where likewise Male-contents were not wanting, who not being strictly consciencious, would rather live without any Restraint; and even some that were honest, were by fair Words persuaded to Separation; for among the Separatists one <HI>Charles Harris</HI> preached, who was pretty fluent in Speech, and not unelegant in his Expressions, as I have seen and heard my self. But how specious soever the Pretence of these Separatists was, and whatever Endeavours were made, yet they were not able to continue and subsist firmly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">At length they differ and come to nothing.</NOTE> but at length they decay'd, and vanished as Snow in the Fields; for the best among them came in Time to see that they had been deceived; and the less honest grew worse; for among themselves they were not free from Division: And tho' <HI>George Keith</HI> (whose Apos∣tacy will be mentioned in the Sequel) endeavoured to skulk among them, yet he got no Adherents there. I have often wondered how <HI>Wilkinson, Harris,</HI> and <HI>Keith</HI> (all which I have known) could apostatize to such a Degree as they did: But yet this is not so exceeding strange as some may think it to be; for we find on Record, that even in the primitive apostolical Church was an <HI>Alexander</HI> the Copper-smith, and an <HI>Hyme∣nous</HI> and <HI>Philetus,</HI> who made Shipwreck of the Faith, and caused a Rent, insomuch that it is said, <HI>Their Words would eat as did a Canker.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim ii 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>At <HI>London</HI> the Meetings this Year were often disturbed; but the Ma∣gistrates themselves seemed not to approve it, for they clearly saw there was nothing to be scared from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and yet they were loth to give Offence to the Court-party which then prevailed.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G.

At ano∣ther Time having been in the Meeting at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and being brought
<PB N="560" REF="003104_0571_0FEFF8BFE21B4708"/>
to a Justice, there was one <HI>Gabriel S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad,</HI> an Informer, who was so full of impertinent Talk, that the Justice grew angry; and yet he thought himself bound to do something; and so asked <HI>G. F. If he did not preach in the Meeting?</HI> To which he warily answered, <HI>That he did confess what Christ had done for his Soul, and did praise God; and that he thought he might have done that in the Streets, and in all Places; and this he was not ashamed to confess, neither was this contrary to the Liturgy of the Church of</HI> England. To this the Justice said, <HI>The Laws were a∣gainst such Meetings as were contrary to the Church of</HI> England; and as length spoke of sending <HI>G. F.</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and said, <HI>He would make a Mittimus after he had dined:</HI> But the Constable coming then, the Justice bid him <HI>come again after the Evening Service;</HI> which the Constable do∣ing, the Justice told him, <HI>He might let</HI> G.F. <HI>go:</HI> And next Day he signified to one of <HI>G. F</HI>'s Friends, that by some Accident he had been disappointed of fining him.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>G. F.</HI> was freed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plot said to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfoot against the King and D. of <HI>Y.</HI> head∣ed by the Duke of <HI>M.</HI> on which ensued the Deaths of Earl of <HI>E.</HI> and Lord <HI>R.</HI></NOTE> and was now much at <HI>London,</HI> where a Plot was said to be on foot against the King and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> of which the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was said to be the Head.

<P>Now since Persecution continued with some Colour of Justice, those called <HI>Quakers</HI> drew up the following Address to the King.</P>

in all Things, not repugnant to his Law and Light in our Consciences, (which is certainly agreeable to the holy Scriptures, and admits not of any immoral or injurious Actions) and that even where, thro' Tenderness of Conscience we cannot conform, it is our Duty patiently to suffer, and not to rebel, nor seek Revenge; and we hope, by his divine Grace, ever to de∣mean our selves, as peaceable minded Christians, in our Conversations un∣der the civil Government; and as we do sincerely, and with Reverence, confess to divine Power and Providence in thy Restoration and Preserva∣tion of thy Person hitherto, so our Prayers and Supplications are to the Almighty for thy future Safety and Peace, and that in a thankful Remem∣brance of God's great Mercies towards thee, thou mayst be thereby obliged to shew Mercy, and relieve the Oppress'd from under these unmerited Af∣flictions and Persecutions, which a great Number of us thy peaceable Sub∣jects do even at this Day suffer under in our Persons and Estates, not only by Laws made against, but also by Laws never intended against us; and which is more extream, divers Severities of late have been, and still are inflicted, for which no Colour or Pretence of Law hath been, or can be alledged, several Jails being so filled, as that they want Air, and many innocent Persons held under extream Distress, without Regard to Age Sex, or Condition, to the Loss of some Lives already, and apparent Hazard of many more; if not to the endangering Infection in divers Cities and Places in this Nation; and so many Houses, Shops, Barns, and Fields ransack'd and swept of Goods, Corn and Cattle, tending also to the great Discouragement of Trade and Husbandry, and to the impoverishing of a great Number of quiet and industrious People, and that for no other Cause, but for their religious Worship, and Exercise of their tender Consciences to∣wards Almighty God that made them, who is the sovereign Lord of all, and King in Mens Consciences.</P>
<P>Therefore we humbly intreat thee, O King, in Princely Justice, Christian Charity and Compassion, to open our Prison-doors, and take off our Bonds, where the Innocent and Oppress'd in thy Land, that fear God, and (in Con∣versation) truly honour the King; and suffer not the Ruin of such as are quiet in the Land, the Widow and the Fatherless for their peaceable Con∣sciences, to lye at the Door of a Prince, professing the tender and com∣passionate Religion of Christ.</P>

<P><HI>This Address was presented to the King at</HI> Windsor, <HI>on the 8th of the Month called</HI> August, <HI>in this Year, by</HI> George Whitehead, Alexander Parker, Gilbert Latey, <HI>and</HI> Francis Comfield, <HI>in Behalf of themselves and their Friends; and it was read to him and his Brother the Duke of</HI> York, <HI>then present with some others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">With small Effect.</NOTE> but no considerable Ease followed: King</HI> Charles <HI>it seems was not to be the Instrument thereof: And tho' that Prince by Nature was not hard-hearted, yet there were some that could persuade him to Severity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I find about this Time that one</HI> Gabriel Shad,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shad</HI> an Infor∣mer found guil∣ty of Felony, es∣capes the Gal∣lows, but is burnt in the Hand.</NOTE> <HI>who had made it his Business to serve as Informer against the</HI> Quakers, <HI>and who had lately informed also against</HI> G.

<P><HI>In the next Year,</HI> viz. <HI>that of 1684,</HI> G. Fox <HI>and</HI> Alexander Parker <HI>came into</HI> Holland, <HI>to visit their Friends there; and after some Stay they returned to their native Country,</HI></P>
<P><HI>In this Year died</HI> Thomas Stordy <HI>of</HI> Moorhouse <HI>in</HI> Cumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1684</NOTE> <HI>a Gen∣tleman who twenty two Years before had been condemned to a Premunire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sufferings and pious End of <HI>T.

Not long before his Decease, he exhorted those that were come to visit him, to Faithful∣ness; for, said he,</HI> If ye continue faithful to the Lord whilst ye live in this World, he will reward you, as now he rewardeth me, with his sweet Peace. <HI>Thus piously</HI> Thomas Stordy <HI>departed this Life, shewing forth that he was really a Gentleman, whose chiefest Nobility consisted in Virtue, I could mention some other Instances or Cases of Persecution; but to make the more Speed towards a Conclusion, I won't detain my Rea∣der with the Relation thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Thomas Briggs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>T.

<P><HI>King</HI> James <HI>had not been long at the Helm of the Government, but the</HI> Dissenters <HI>applied to him for Liberty of Worship, and among these were also the</HI> Quakers, <HI>who made the following Petition.</HI></P>

to late Accounts) about <HI>One Thousand, three Hundred, Eighty and Three,</HI> above <HI>Two Hundred</HI> of them <HI>Women.</HI> Many under Sen∣tence of <HI>Premunire,</HI> (both Men and Women) and more than <HI>Three Hundred</HI> near it; not for denying the Duty, or refusing the Substance of Allegiance it self, but only because they dare not <HI>Swear:</HI> Many on Writs of <HI>Excommunication,</HI> and <HI>Fines</HI> for the King, and upon the Act for <HI>Banishment:</HI> Besides above <HI>Three Hundred</HI> and <HI>Twenty</HI> have died in Prison and Prisoners since the Year 1660, near <HI>One Hundred</HI> whereof, by means of this long Imprisonment (as 'tis judg'd) since the Account delivered to the late King and Parliament, in 1680; thereby making Widows and Fatherless, and leaving them in Distress and Sorrow: The two last hard Winters Restraint, and the close Confinement of great Numbers in divers Jails, unavoidably tending towards their Destruction, their Healths being evidently impaired thereby.</P>
<P>And here in <HI>London,</HI> the Jail of <HI>Newgate</HI> hath been from Time to Time crouded, within these two Years, (sometimes near Twenty in one Room) to the Prejudice of their Health; and several poor inno∣cent Tradesmen, of late, have been so suffocated by the Closeness of the Prison, that they have been taken out sick of a Malignant Fever, and died in a few Days after.</P>
<P>Besides these long continued and destructive Hardships upon the Per∣sons of Men and Women as aforesaid, <HI>great Violences, outragious Dis∣tresses,</HI> and <HI>woful Havock</HI> and <HI>Spoil</HI> have been, and still are frequently made upon our Goods and Estates, both in and about this City of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and other Parts of this Nation, by a Company of idle, extrava∣gant and merciless Informers, and their Prosecutions upon the <HI>Conven∣ticle-Act,</HI> many being convicted and fined, <HI>unsummoned,</HI> and <HI>unheard</HI> in their own Defence. As also on <HI>Qui Tam</HI> Writs, at the Suit of Informers (who prosecute for one third Part for themselves) and on other Pro∣cesses, for <HI>twenty Pound a Mouth, and two Thirds of Estates,</HI> seized for the King; all tending to the <HI>Ruin</HI> of <HI>Trade, Husbandry,</HI> and <HI>Farmers,</HI> and the <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poverishing</HI> of many <HI>industrious Families,</HI> without Compas∣sion shewn to <HI>Widows, Fatherless,</HI> or <HI>Desolate:</HI> To some, not a <HI>Bed</HI> left to rest upon; to others, no <HI>Cattle</HI> to till their Ground, nor <HI>Corn</HI> for Bread or Seed, nor <HI>Tools</HI> to work withal: The said Informers and She∣riffs Bailiffs in some Places being <HI>outragious</HI> and <HI>excessive</HI> in their <HI>Dis∣tresses</HI> and <HI>Seizures,</HI> breaking into Houses, and making great Waste and Spoil.

<P>The Statutes on which we, the said People suffer <HI>Imprisonment, Dis∣tress,</HI> and <HI>Spoil,</HI> are as followeth:</P>
<P>The 5th of <HI>Eliz. Chap.</HI> 23. <HI>De Excommunicato Capiendo.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="564" REF="003104_0575_0FEFF8C6BA544810"/>Upon Indictments at <HI>Common Law,</HI> pretended and framed against out peaceable Religious Assemblies, for <HI>Riots, Routs, Breach of the Peace,</HI> &amp;c. Many, both Men and Women, thereupon fined, impri∣son'd, and detained for Non-payment, some till Death. Instance, the City of <HI>Bristol,</HI> what a great Number have been these divers Years straitly confined and crouded in jail, mostly above <HI>One Hundred</HI> on such Pretence, about <HI>Seventy</HI> of them Women, many aged. And in the City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> in the Years 1682, and 83, about <HI>Seventy</HI> kept in hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Forty-five</HI> where of in Holes and Dungeons, for many Weeks together, and great Hardships have been, and are in other Places. So that such our peaceable Meetings are sometimes fined on the <HI>Con∣venticle-Act,</HI> as for a <HI>Religious Exercise,</HI> and other Times at <HI>Com∣mon Law,</HI> as <HI>Riotous, Routous,</HI> &amp;c. when nothing of that Nature could ever be proved against them, there being nothing of <HI>Violence</HI> or <HI>Injury</HI> either <HI>done, threatned,</HI> or <HI>intended</HI> against the Person or Property of any other whatsoever.</P>
<P>The during and tedious <HI>Imprisonments</HI> are chiefly on the Writs <HI>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</HI> upon the Judgment of <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>munire,</HI> and upon <HI>Fines,</HI> said to be for the King.</P>
<P>The <HI>great Spoil</HI> and <HI>excessive Distresses</HI> and <HI>Seizures,</HI> are chiefly up∣on the <HI>Conventicle-Act,</HI> and for <HI>Twenty Pound a Month, Two Thirds of Estates,</HI> and on <HI>Qui Tam</HI> Writs. In some Counties, divers have suffer'd by <HI>Seizures</HI> and <HI>Distresses</HI> above eight Years last past, and Writs issued out for farther Seizures in several Counties, for <HI>twenty Pounds a Month,</HI> amounting to the Value of many <HI>Thousands of Pounds,</HI> some∣times seizing for eleven Months at once, and making Sale of all Goods and Chattels, within Doors and without, both of <HI>Houshold-Goods, Beds, Shop-Goods, Moveables, Cattle,</HI> &amp;c. and Prosecution hereupon still continued, and in divers Counties much increased. So that several, who have long employ'd some <HI>Hundreds</HI> of poor Families in Manu∣facture, and paid considerable Taxes to the King, are greatly disabled from both, by these Writs and Seizures, as well as by long Imprison∣ments. So many Serge-makers of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> as kept above <HI>Five Hun∣dred</HI> poor People at work, disabled by Imprisonment: Many in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> under a long Imprisonment, sentenced to a <HI>Premu∣nire,</HI> one whereof employ'd at least <HI>Two Hundred</HI> poor People in the Woollen Manufacture, when at Liberty. Omitting other Instances, that we may not seem too tedious, these may evince how destructive such Severities are to Trade and Industry, and ruinous to many poor Families.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Conventicle-Act,</HI> within these two Years last past, many <HI>in and about this City of</HI> London have been extremely oppressed, impaired, and spoiled in their Estates and Trades, upon numerous Convictions and Warrants made against them in their <HI>Absence,</HI> upon the Credit of Informations sworn by <HI>concealed Informers,</HI> divers of them <HI>impudent Women,</HI> who swear for their Profit in Part of the Fines and Seizures, their Husbands being Prisoners for Debt, thro' their own Extravagan∣cies. The Warrants commonly made to break open and enter Hou∣ses, which is done with Rigour and great Spoil, not sparing <HI>Widows, Fatherless,</HI> or <HI>poor Families,</HI> who are sustain'd by their daily Care and Industry, not leaving them a Bed to rest upon. The <HI>Fines</HI> upon one Justice's Warrants amounting to many <HI>Hundreds of Pounds;</HI> frequently <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> a Warrant, and two Warrants at once for <HI>Twenty Pounds,</HI> executed upon one Person; and three Warrants at once from another Justice, for <HI>Sixty Pounds</HI> upon another Person, and all his Goods car∣ried away in about <HI>ten Cart-loads;</HI> and five Warrants at once for <HI>Fifty Pounds</HI> upon another, &amp;c. besides what we have suffered by others in
<PB N="565" REF="003104_0576_0FEFF880E5A4C3B8"/>
the like Kind. And in this destructive Course the <HI>Informers</HI> have En∣couragement, and are suffered still to go on, to the ruining many Fa∣milies in their Trades and Livelihoods; divers so discouraged and dis∣abled, that they are forced to give over their Shops and Trades.</P>
<P>These <HI>Informers</HI> being accepted for credible Witnesses, <HI>yet Parties, swearing for their own Profit and Gain, in the Absence of the Persons prosecuted:</HI> This we think is very hard and undue Proceeding, and not consistent with common Law or Justice.</P>
<P>As also convicting and fining us upon their Depositions, <HI>unsum∣mon'd</HI> and <HI>unheard</HI> in our own Defence, and so keeping us ignorant of our Accusers, (unless upon Traverse of our <HI>Appeals.</HI>) This Procedure appears contrary to the Law<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Dent. xix. 17, 18. John vii. 11. Prov. xxvi. 2. Job xxix. 16, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gen iii. 8. Judges xix. 30.</NOTE> of God, common Justice, and Equi∣ty, and to the Law and Justice of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Acts xxv. 5, 7, 8, 10, 16.</NOTE> and of Nations.</P>
<P>And altho' it has been openly manifested, upon Trial of <HI>Appeals,</HI> at several Quarter-Sessions, both for <HI>Middlesex</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> and other Places, that the Depositions of divers Informers have been false in Fact, yet the great Trouble and Charge in the <HI>Traverse</HI> of <HI>Appeals,</HI> and the great Encouragement Informers have from <HI>Him</HI> who grants the most Warrants, hath been a Discouragement to many from seek∣ing such difficult Remedy, considering also the treble Costs against the <HI>Appellant,</HI> in Case he succeeds not, or is not acquitted upon <HI>Trial;</HI> whereas there is no Costs nor Restitution awarded nor given against the Informers, for unjust Prosecution. Some also having refused to grant <HI>Appeals,</HI> others denied Copies of Warrants to prevent <HI>Appeals:</HI> Which, whether this be equal or just, pray consider, ye that are wise and judicious Men: And whether it be for the <HI>King's Honour,</HI> and the <HI>People's Interest,</HI> that idle, drunken, extravagant Informers should either be encouraged or suffered to go on thus to ruin <HI>Trade, Husbandry,</HI> and <HI>Families,</HI> or to command and threaten <HI>Justices of Peace,</HI> with the <HI>Forfeiture of an hundred Pounds,</HI> if they do not make Con∣victions, and issue out Warrants upon their bare Informations, and uncertain Depositions, frequently in the Absence of the Accused.</P>
<P>And <HI>Lastly,</HI> One third Part of the Fines being assigned to the <HI>King,</HI> he can only remit that; but the <HI>Informers</HI> and <HI>Poor</HI> being assigned two third Parts, seems not to allow him to remit them, how much Cause soever may appear to him, to extend his Favour in that Case. Is not this against the <HI>King's Prerogative,</HI> to restrain his <HI>Sovereign Clemency?</HI> And how far it reflects upon the Government, and is scan∣dalous thereto, for <HI>beggarly rude Informers</HI> (some of them <HI>confident Women</HI>) not only to command, threaten, and disquiet <HI>Justices, Peace-Officers.</HI> &amp;c. but to destroy the King's honest, industrious, and peace∣able Subjects, in their <HI>Properties</HI> and <HI>Estates,</HI> is worthy of your seri∣ous Considerations; And whether the said <HI>Conventicle-Act</HI> ought not therefore justly to be repealed? A noted Instance of the like Case, we have, concerning the Statute of the II <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. <HI>ch.</HI> 3. (for de∣termining certain Offences and Contempts, only upon Informers Pro∣secutions) being repealed in the first Year of K. <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. <HI>ch.</HI> 6. tho' that, in some Respects, was more tolerable than this.</P>
<P>Be pleased to make our Case your own, and <HI>do to us, as you would be done unto;</HI> as you would not be oppressed or destroyed in your <HI>Persons</HI> or <HI>Estates,</HI> nor have your <HI>Properties invaded,</HI> and <HI>Poste∣rities ruined</HI> for serving and worshipping Almighty God (that made

all Mankind) according to your Persuasions and Consciences, but would, no doubt, enjoy the Liberty thereof: So we intreat you to allow the same Liberty to <HI>tender Consciences,</HI> that live peaceably under the Government, as you would enjoy your selves; and to dis∣annul the said <HI>Conventicle-Act,</HI> and to <HI>stop</HI> these <HI>devouring Informers,</HI> and also take away all <HI>sanguinary Laws, corporal</HI> and <HI>pecuniary Pu∣nishments,</HI> meetly on the Score of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Conscience;</HI> and let not the <HI>Ruin</HI> and <HI>Cry</HI> of the <HI>Widow, Fatherless,</HI> and <HI>innocent Families</HI> lie upon this Nation, nor at your Door, who have not only a great Trust reposed in you for the Prosperity and Good of the whole Na∣tion, but also do profess <HI>Christianity,</HI> and the tender Religion of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding all these long sustain'd Extremities, we, the said suffering People, do solemnly profess and declare in the Sight of the All-seeing God, who is the Searcher of Hearts, That as we have never been found in any <HI>seditious</HI> or <HI>treasonable Designs,</HI> (they being wholly contrary to our Christian Principle and Profession) so we have nothing but <HI>good Will,</HI> and <HI>true christian Affection</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> sincerely desiring His and Your Safety, Prosperity and Concurrence in <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> for the Good of the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Having thus given you, in short, the general State of our Suf∣fering Case, in Matter of Fact, without Personal Reflection, We, in</HI> Christian Humility, <HI>and for</HI> Christ's-sake, <HI>intreat that you will tenderly and charitably consider of the Premises, and find out some effectual Expedient or Way for our</HI> Relief <HI>from</HI> Prisons, Spoil, <HI>and</HI> Ruin.</P>

But many of the Episcopal Church were so strongly bent to with-hold that Liberty from other Pro∣testants, that there were no ill-grounded Reports, that some in Authority had promised the King to give their Vote for Liberty of Conscience to the Papists, provided it was not granted to other Dissenters. Neverthe∣less the abovesaid Petition of the</HI> Quakers <HI>had such Effect, that the King resolved to ease them from the Burthen of their Oppression, by Way of</HI> Pardon; <HI>for thus far his Power reach'd: But the abrogating of Laws could not be done without the Consent of the Parliament, which grew jealous, that by the Repeal of those Laws, the Papists, who now had a King of their own Religion, would become too powerful.

This was the King's first Step towards Liberty of Conscience, as well for Papists, as other Persons mentioned in the Schedule annex'd, which put an effectual Stop to Persecution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Stop put to Persecution</NOTE> and the Power of the Informers was thereby much broken.

<P>Thus the Informers met with a Stop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many released from their Im∣prisonment.</NOTE> and the persecuted <HI>Quakers</HI> got some Rest; for Persecution not only ceased, but many, who for Reli∣gion-sake had been several Years kept in Prison, obtained Liberty by the Favour of a Popish Prince, which they had not been able to get from his Brother, King <HI>Charles the Second.</HI> Now many of the fierce Perse∣cutors came to Shame, some to Poverty, and others to a miserable End, of which no small Number of Instances might be produced, if I were minded to enlarge; however I'll mention one or two.</P>
<P>One <HI>Edward Davis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Behaviour of <HI>E. Davis</HI> Keeper of <HI>Ivel∣chester</HI> Jayl to <HI>J. Whiting,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> who once profess'd to be a <HI>Quaker,</HI> but not be∣ing sincere, found that Way too narrow for him, and so left his Friends, which afterwards, being become Keeper of the Jail of <HI>Ivelchester</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> he vexed most grievously, and from meer Malice fettered some, saying to <HI>John Whiting</HI> and another, whom he had Hand-bolted together, <HI>Those Bolts should not be taken off if Lice did eat them up.</HI> And his Comrade <HI>Joseph Newberry</HI> was but little better; for when somebody told him, <HI>That their Hands did swell with the Irons,</HI> he said, <HI>He did not care if their Hearts did swell also.</HI> And when one <HI>John Dando</HI> once ask'd <HI>Davis, What he thought would become of him when he came to dye?</HI> he answered, <HI>That he knew what would become of him then, and therefore he would make the best of his Time now.</HI> Also, <HI>that he knew where he went out, and where he must come in again if ever he was saved; and if he thought he should never return again, he would be as wicked as he could.</HI> Truly a most desperate Saying, just as if the Door of Mercy always con∣tinued open for Man, and the Day of the Visitation of God's Love never pass'd over his Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The miserable Condition of the sord <HI>Davis,</HI> and dreadful Death of his Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>J. Newberry</HI></NOTE> tho' he persevered in Rebellion. But this <HI>Davis</HI> came to a most pitiful State, so that he fell into Poverty, and was himself imprisoned for Debts, of which more hereafter. And <HI>Newberry</HI> fell into a sad Condition, being taken with a severe Palsey, and yet he did not leave off Cursing and Swearing, talking of the Devil in a dreadful Manner.
<PB N="570" REF="003104_0581_0FEFF8D0139D9370"/>
And by lying long in Bed, the Flesh rotted on his Back, and he who had formerly said concerning the Hand-bolted Prisoners, <HI>He did not care if their Hearts did swell,</HI> got now such a sore Tongue, that it swelled out of his Mouth, and grew black, and so he died miserably on the tenth of <HI>December.</HI> Thus God sometimes punisheth the wicked even in this Life. And tho' Persecutors come not always to such a miserable End, yet ma∣ny of these fell into Poverty, and others were discontented because they saw that those whom they had cruelly persecuted, now enjoyed an un∣disturbed Liberty; for the King who was now on the Throne continued to give Liberty to those that had been oppressed for Religion.</P>
<P>But before I say more of this, I can't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut mention something of the Design of the unhappy Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who at the Death of his Father King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, was gone to <HI>Brussels;</HI> and being come from thence into <HI>Holland,</HI> he was spurred on so vigorously by some hot∣headed <HI>Englishmen,</HI> that having got Money and Assistance of Malecon∣tents, he went over to <HI>England</HI> with three Men of War, and some For∣ces, having given forth a Declaration against King <HI>James,</HI> which vented a fiery Passion toward that Prince, and was written as I have been cre∣dibly told,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI> &amp;c. lands in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> is attain∣ted, defeated, ta∣ken and behead∣ed.</NOTE> by the violent <HI>Robert Ferguson. Monmouth</HI> being landed with his Forces in the West of <HI>England</HI> near <HI>Lime,</HI> and afterwards routed by the King's Troops, was taken Prisoner by the Perfidiousness of a certain Lord, who thereby obtained Pardon for himself; but <HI>Ferguson</HI> escaped by a cunning Artifice, crying along the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d where he came galloping on Horseback,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ferguson</HI> escapes by a Wile.</NOTE> <HI>The Rebels are routed, the Rebels are routed,</HI> just as if he had been a Courier sent on purpose to Court and elsewhere. But thus he escaped, and being come again into <HI>Holland,</HI> he told this crafty Trick to his Acquaintance. <HI>Monmouth</HI> having been declared guilty of High Treason by a Bill of Attainder, as soon as the News came of his Design, was, but two or three Days after his Arrival at <HI>London,</HI> beheaded. I count it not unworthy to be mentioned, that he undauntedly received the News of the Dead-warrant's being come, and on the Scaffold on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> he told the Bishops that accompanied him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Occasional Expressions of the Duke at his Execution, with some other Pas∣sages.</NOTE> <HI>If I had no true Repentance, I should not be so free from the Fear of Death.</HI> And when it was ob∣jected, that he ought not to rely too much on that, since that might be the Effect of natural Courage, he said, <HI>No, I don't ascribe this to my Nature; for naturally I am more fearful than others, but now I am freed of Fear; because I feel something in me, which gives me Assurance that I shall go to God.</HI> The Executioner gave him several Strokes with the Ax, before the Head was severed from the Body; and some Ecclesiasticks afterwards said, <HI>He died an Enthusiast:</HI> For not shewing himself very ready to comply with their Service, and his saying, <HI>That something within him assured him that he should go to God,</HI> seemed to them an En∣thusiastical Tenet. But whatever it was, yet it seems very probable to me, that he was a true Penitent, and so died in Peace; for tho' I can't but disapprove his Design, yet by true Repentance he might not only have obtained Forgiveness of God, but also have had a full Assurance of it.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The E. of <HI>Ar∣gile</HI> has the same Lot.</NOTE> who rebelled in <HI>Scotland</HI> against King <HI>James,</HI> had no better Lot; but I will not detain my Reader therewith, neither with a Relation of the dismal Execution of many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dismal Exe∣cutions by the in-famous L.

<P><PB N="571" REF="003104_0582_0FEFF8892FAB0C78"/>Therefore leaving <HI>England,</HI> I'll take a Turn to <HI>Embden</HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> where a small Company of those called <HI>Quakers</HI> had been under a severe Persecution for several Years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Magistrates of <HI>Em¦den</HI> having seen and settle Mischief of Per∣secution, send to <HI>M. van Loar</HI> to invite <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> to come and reside among them, which she accordingly com∣municated.</NOTE> as I have hinted before.

And since the Protestants in <HI>France</HI> were now persecuted violently, and a Popish Prince had mounted the <HI>English</HI> Throne, those at <HI>Embden</HI> grew more enclined to Moderation. Probably the Decay of Trade also contributed a little to this Change; for it appeared that the Magistrates were for getting more Inhabitants into their Town, tho' they should be <HI>Quakers;</HI> and this was counted a Matter of such Moment, that the Common Council delibe∣rated on the Subject; and two of the Members of that Board, <HI>viz.

After some Deliberation, the Magistrates with the Council of Forty, and the Eccle∣siastick Court met together, and came to a Resolution, of which a Copy was sent to <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> In this Writing were mentioned some Conditions on which the Magistrates at <HI>Embden</HI> were willing to grant Liberty to the <HI>Quakers</HI> to live in their City. But those of that Society at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> having weighed and duly considered the Thing, found that the Proposal contained some Expressions, which by others, who afterwards might come to the Helm, and not be so moderate as these at present, might be used as Snares against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> if they now should enter upon such Terms as were prescribed. Therefore it was thought more safe not to enter into any Engagement, whereby great Inconveni∣ence might afterwards attend their Friends, when the Magistracy came to be in other Hando. Yet the Conclusion was, to acknowledge the good Intention of the Magistrates of <HI>Embden,</HI> by drawing up the fol∣lowing Letter, and sending it to them.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Lords Burghermasters, Counsellors and Rulers of the City of <HI>EMBDEN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THese are to acquaint you with due Respect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Friends in <HI>Holland</HI> made this return to them.</NOTE> that a Scheme or Plan of yours, dated the 16-26 <HI>February,</HI> 1686, is come to our Hands, which having been perused by us, we have thought it convenient in the Fear of the Lord, to send you the following Answer.
First, we thank God Almighty for the Ease and Liberty which our Friends at present enjoy under your Government, and are like to en∣joy in the future. And, Secondly, We cannot but acknowledge very acceptably your Clemency and Meekness, which ye shew by taking Notice of the State of a despised and oppressed People, who because of their Way and Worship, differing from the many Ways in the World, are gainsayed every where. And therefore it is that we are the more stirr'd up in our Minds to pray servently to the Lord God for your Peace and Prosperity, and the Continuance of your good Re∣solution; that so all those who serve the Lord in Uprightness of Heart may lead a peaceable and godly Life among you, by shewing forth the Fruits of true Christianity in Truth, Sincerity, and Righteousness. Now as to what ye have been pleased to declare, that ye were willing to confirm the aforesaid your good Resolution by a publick Act, we
<PB N="572" REF="003104_0583_0FEFF8CDB66D9FD0"/>
let you know, that we are so well satisfied with your Word and Oral Declaration concerning the afore-mentioned Thing, that this is more to us than any thing we could further desire, as knowing that good Men think themselves bound by their good Words to perform what is good. And since ye are sensible on what Ground ye came to the a∣foresaid Resolution, and declared yourselves thus, we doubt not but the same Persuasion and Reason continuing with you, will prove a more strong Engagement to you to perform the same, than any out∣ward Seal can be. And in that Engagement we are willing to acqui∣esce, and should not have mentioned any other, unless some among you, as we have been informed, first had made mention thereof. And as to what ye demand of us, we declare in the Nakedness and Sim∣plicity of our Hearts, that in Regard of our Temporal Conversation and Deportment, we desire no further Protection, than when we deal righteously to all, and walk according to that Golden Rule, That we do unto all Men, what we desire should be done to us. And concern∣ing our Religion and Worship, which we believe we owe to Almighty God, it is thus: That since it differs from other Persuasions, it makes us obnoxious not only to the Mockings and Revilings of ignorant People, but exposeth us also to the Malice and Envy of many, who hate us without a just Cause; and therefore it is that we stand in need of your favourable Interpretation, and your best Construction of what we do, and what we leave undone. And if we should err in those Matters, we shall be the greatest Losers by it; and if Truth be on our Side, then our Adversaries shall not be able to prevail; for Truth is the strongest, and it is not good for any to fight against it. Howsoever then it may be with us in this Matter, yet we hope that ye will be pleased, if we behave our selves peaceable and honest to∣wards you and all Men, to let us be Partakers with our peaceable Neighbours of your general Protection. And tho' ye might please to give us a publick Act of your aforesaid Resolution, yet we clearly foresee, that it would be hardly possible to use such Expressions, that our Enemies, by some wresting or other of the Words, or a wrong Interpretation of the Expressions contained therein, should not be able to make us steemed guilty of Transgression, and so find Matter a∣gainst us. And therefore we think it very safe to rely on your Word, and good Resolution, in which it hath pleased you to declare, that we shall enjoy Liberty to live and trade in your City, provided we pay Custom and Taxes which other Citizens are subject to; and that then we shall be at Liberty to meet together to worship God in such a Way as he hath convinced us we ought to do, and to call upon him, and to exhort one another to Love and good Works, and a Christian Conversation. And on your Behalf it will tend to the Praise of the Magistrates, that ye favour us in this. And it will also be to the promoting of God's Glory; and will oblige us to pray for you, that the Lord God may be pleased to preserve you, and to make you con∣tinue in such a good, wholesome, and well-grounded Resolution. We are and rest,</P>

The following Letter is also a Proof of it, written by the Earl of <HI>Sun∣derland,</HI> (then, as I think, President of the Privy-Council) to the Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> to stop the Persecution in <HI>Leicestershire</HI> and <HI>Nottingham∣shire,</HI> where one <HI>John Smith</HI> had acted most grievously.</P>

the Lord hath enclined his Heart; and having taken particular Notice of our Sufferings, hath signified his Will and Pleasure, that we, the People commonly called</HI> Quakers, <HI>should receive the full Benefit of his General Pardon, with all possible Ease; which Grace and Favour we, with all Thankfulness, acknowledge to God as the chief Author, who hath the Hearts of Kings at his Disposal; and to the King, as being ready herein to mind that which the Lord inclined his Heart unto, and not without Hope to find the like Opportunity to render to you our hearty Thanks, for the full Ac∣complishment of that which our God allows, and the King so readily grants us: And also hearing the Report of your Nobility and Moderation, in managing this weighty Trust committed to you, we are imboldned thus to address our selves, tho' in Plainness of Speech, yet in Sincerity of Heart, to lay before you, that we have for several Years been Prisoners to the Jail aforesaid, not for any Plotting against the King or Government, or Harm done to his Subjects; our peaceable Lives have manifested our Fidelity to the King, and Love to our Neighbours, it being contrary to our Princi∣ples to do otherwise: But only for Conscience-sake, because in Obedience to Christ Jesus we dare not Swear at all, or forbear to worship God, as he hath ordained, nor conform to those Worships which we have no Faith in; which to omit the one, or practise the other, we should therein sin, and so wound our Consciences, and break our Peace with God; and what good then should our Lives do us, if we might enjoy never so much of the World's Favour and Friendship?</HI></P>
<P>Our humble Request therefore to you is, to consider and compassio∣nate our Suffering Condition, and improve the Power and Autho∣rity that God and the King hath entrusted you withal, for our Relief and Liberty; we still resolving, and hoping (thro' God's Assistance) for the future, to manifest our Fear to God, Honour to the King, and Honesty to all his Subjects, by our godly, hum∣ble, and peaceable Conversation. The particular Causes of our Im∣prisonments are herewith attested, under our Keeper's Hand. And we further pray, that mercenary Informers, and envious Prosecu∣tors against us, only for Conscience-sake, may, according to your Wisdom and Prudence, be discouraged from Prosecuting such Actions, by which many industrious and consciencious Families, and Persons, are in danger of being ruin'd; and we encouraged in our Diligence in our respective Callings, and may enjoy the Bene∣fit of our Industry; and so shall we be the better enabled to per∣form with Chearfulness the Duties we owe to God, the King, and all Men. The Lord guide you in Judgment, and more and more incline your Hearts to <HI>love Mercy,</HI> and <HI>do Justice,</HI> and grant you the Reward thereof; which is truly our Desire and Prayer.</P>

And therefore it is good to trust in the Lord, and cast your Care up∣on him, who careth for you. For when ye were in your Goals and Prisons, then the Lord did by his Eternal Arm and Power uphold you, and sanctified them to you (and unto some he had made them as a Sanctuary;) and tried his People, as in a Furnace of Affliction, both in Prisons, and Spoiling of Goods. And in all this the Lord was with his People, and taught them to know, that <HI>The Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness thereof;</HI> and that he was in all Places, <HI>who crowneth the Year with his Goodness,</HI> Psal. lxv. Therefore let all God's People be diligent, and careful to keep the Camp of God holy, pure and clean, and to serve God and Christ, and one another in the glorious, peaceable Gospel of Life and Salvation; which Glory shines over God's Camp, and his great Prophet, and Bishop, and Shepherd is among or in the midst of them, exercising his Heavenly Offices in them: So that you his People may rejoice in Christ Jesus, thro' whom you have Peace with God. For he that destroyeth the Devil and his Work, and bruises the Serpent's Head, is all God's People's heavenly Foundation and Rock to build upon; which was the Holy Prophets and Apostles Rock in Days past, and is now a Rock of our Age; which Rock and Foundation of God standeth sure.

<P>In this Year <HI>David Barclay</HI> died at <HI>Ury</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pious End of <HI>D. Barclay,</HI> with some re∣markable Ex∣pressions and Occurences a little before his Death.</NOTE> Before his De∣parture he utter'd many excellent Expressions indeed. I may not omit to mention some Particulars. In the latter End of <HI>September,</HI> being past the 76th Year of his Age, he was taken with a Fever, which con∣tinued two Weeks; and being much troubled with the Gravel, his Sick∣ness was accompanied with Pain in making Water. Two Days before his Death, feeling his Weakness, and being in an Agony, he said to his Son <HI>Robert,</HI> who was with him, <HI>I shall go now to the Lord, and be ga∣thered to many of my Brethren who are gone before me.</HI> On the 11th of <HI>October,</HI> very early in the Morning, he growing weaker, the said <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> signified to him, that his Travel was, <HI>That he that love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, might be near him to the End.</HI> To which he answered, <HI>The Lord is nigh,</HI> and said further to thofe about him, <HI>Ye are my Witnesses in the Presence of God, that the Lord is nigh.</HI> And a little after, he said, <HI>The perfect Discovery of the Day-spring from on high, how great a Blessing it hath been to me and my Family! Robert Barclay's</HI> Wife asking, if he would have something to refresh him, he said, <HI>It needed not;</HI> and lay¦ing his Hand upon his Breast, he said, <HI>He had that inwardly, that re∣freshed him.</HI> A little while after, he was heard several Times to say, <HI>The Truth is over all;</HI> and taking his Son's eldest Son to him, he blessed him, and said, <HI>He prayed God he might never depart from the Truth.</HI>
<PB N="577" REF="003104_0588_0FEFF89146C45878"/>
Then his Son's eldest Daughter coming near, he said, <HI>Is this</HI> Patience? (for that was her Name.) <HI>Let Patience have its perfect Work in thee.</HI> And after kissing the other four of his Son's Children, he laid Hands upon them, and blessed them. His Apothecary, that attended him, coming also near, he took him by the Hand, and said, <HI>Thou wilt bear me witness, that in all this Exercise I have not been curious to tamper, nor to pamper the Flesh.</HI> To which the Apothecary said, <HI>Sir, I can bear witness that you have always minded the better and more substantial Part; and I rejoice to see the blessed End the Lord is bringing you to.</HI> To this the sick Man reply'd, <HI>Bear a faithful and true Witness; yet it is the Life of Righteousness; the Life of Righteousness it is that we bear Te∣stimony to, and not to an empty Profession.</HI> Then he called several Times, <HI>Come, Lord Jesus, come, come!</HI> And said also, <HI>My Hope is in the Lord.</HI> Afterward he slept now and then for some Hours; and seeing a Car∣penter coming into the Room, he said to his Son, <HI>See thou charge him to make no manner of Superfluity upon the Coffin.</HI> In the Afternoon se∣veral of his Friends came to see him, which he having observed, said, <HI>They were come in a seasonable Time;</HI> and after some Words were spoken, and that <HI>Patrick Living stone</HI> had prayed, which ended in Praises, the sick old Man held up his Hands, and said, <HI>Amen, Amen, for ever!</HI> And after those that were present stood up, he said, <HI>How precious is the Love of God among his Children, and their Love to one another! Thereby shall all Men know that ye are Christ's Disciples, if ye love one another. How precious a Thing it is to see Brethren to dwell together in Love! My Love is with you, I leave it among you.</HI> Several of his Friends, pretty late at Night, standing about the Bed, and perceiving some of them to weep, he said, <HI>Dear Friends, all mind the inward Man, heed not the out∣ward. There is one that doth reward, the Lord of Hosts is his Name.</HI> Next Morning, after he had heard the Clock strike Three, he said, <HI>Now the Time comes.</HI> And a little after he was heard to say, <HI>Praises, Praises, Praises to the Lord! Let now thy Servant depart in Peace. In∣to thy Hands, O Father, I commit my Soul, Spirit and Body. Thy Will, O Lord, be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</HI> These Sentences he spoke by little Intervals, one after another; and soon after five in the Morn∣ing, the 12th of <HI>October,</HI> he slept in Peace and Quiet, there being pre∣sent at his End above twenty Persons, who were Witnesses to what hath been here related. His Corps was attended to the Grave by numerous Followers; and tho' he had order'd not many to be called to his Burial, yet a great Number of the Gentry came uninvited, from an Esteem they bore to his Memory.</P>

<P>About this Time, <HI>G. Fox</HI> writ some general Epistles (some: of which were pretty large) to his Friends, exhorting them to shun Strife, to keep to mutual Love and Unity, and to mind true Piety. He writ many other edifying Papers, and since the Papists now appeared barefaced, and per∣formed their Worship publickly, and there was much Talk of their Pray∣ing to Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1687</NOTE> and by Beads, in the Year 1687 he emitted the following Paper concerning Prayer, not fearing to contradict openly that which he judged to be Superstition, tho' the King himself was of the Popish Religion.</P>
<P><Q>CHrist Jesus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F</HI>'s Paper concerning Prayer.</NOTE> when he taught his Disciples to pray, said unto them, <HI>When ye do pray, say, Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name,</HI> &amp;c. Christ doth not say, that they should pray to <HI>Mary,</HI> the Mother of Christ; nor doth he say, that they should pray to An∣gels, or to Saints that were dead. Christ did not teach them to pray to the Dead, nor for the Dead. Neither did Christ or his Apostles teach the Believers to pray by Beads, nor to sing by outward Organs: But the Apostle said, he would <HI>sing and pray in Spirit:</HI> For the Spirit it self <HI>maketh Intercession; and the Lord, that searcheth the Hearty know∣eth the Mind of the Spirit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To take Counsel of the Dead, was forbidden by the Law of God; but they were to take Counsel of the Lord; And he hath given Christ in the New Covenant, in his Gospel-day, to be a Counsellor and a Lead∣er, to all his Believers in his Light. And Men are not to run to the Dead for the Living: For the Law and Testimony of God forbids it. Those <HI>Jews,</HI> that refused the running Waters of <HI>Shiloh,</HI> the Floods and Waters of the <HI>Assyrians</HI> and <HI>Babylonians</HI> came over them, and carried them into Captivity: And they that refuse the Waters of Christ, they are overflown with the Flood of the World, that lieth in Wick∣edness. They that asked Counsel of Stocks and Stones, their State was in the Spirit of Error and Whoredom; and they were gone a <HI>whoring from God,</HI> Hos. iv. 12. And they, that <HI>joined themselves to</HI> Baal-Peor, <HI>and eat the Sacrifices of the Dead, provoked the Lord's Anger, and brought the Lord's Displeasure upon them,</HI> Psal. cvi. 28, 29.

In the mean while he writ much; for he was of a laborious Temper, and did not omit under all his Business, to visit the Meetings of his Friends, and to edify them by his Admonitions and Exhortations.

<P>It would indeed have been more acceptable if this Liberty had been established by the King and Parliament, this being granted as yet only by Vertue of his Royal Prerogative: But however it was, Liberty was enjoyed. The Friends therefore of the Church at <HI>London,</HI> seeing how those of other Persuasions presented Addresses of Thanks to the King, for his Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, which was now published, and whereby the Dissenters were permitted to perform their Worship freely, provided their Preaching did not tend to make the Minds of People averse to the Government, thought it convenient to draw up an Address also, and present it to the King; which was as followeth;</P>

<P>And as we rejoice to see the Day, that a King of <HI>England</HI> should from, his Royal Seat so universally assert this glorious Principle, that Conscience ought not to be constrained, nor People forced for Matters of meer Re∣ligion, (the Want of which happy Conduct in Government, has been the Desolation of Countries, and Reproach of Religion) so we do with humble and sincere Hearts, render to God first, and the King next, our sensible Acknowledgments; and because they cannot be better express'd than in godly, peaceable, and dutiful Life, it shall be our Endeavour, (with God's Help) always to approve our selves the King's faithful and loving Sub∣jects,

<P>That, which remains, Great Prince, for us to do, is, to beseech Almighty God (by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice) to inspire thee more and more with his excellent Wisdom and Understanding, to pursue this Christian Design of Ease to all religious <HI>Dissenters,</HI> with the most agreeable and lasting Methods: And we pray God to bless the King, his Royal Family, and People, with Grace and Peace; and that after a long and prosperous Reign here, he may receive a better Crown a∣mongst the Blessed.</P>

And since it hath pleased the King out of his great Compassion, thus to commiserate our afflicted Con∣dition, which hath so particularly appeared by his gracious Procla∣mation and Warrants last Year, (whereby above twelve hundred Pri∣soners were released from their severe Imprisonments, and many others from Spoil and Ruin in their Estates and Properties) and his Princely Speech in Council, and christian Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, in which he doth not only express his Aversion to all Force upon Con∣science, and grant all his dissenting Subjects an ample Liberty to wor∣ship God in the Way they are persuaded is most agreeable to his Will, but gives them his Kingly Word, the same shall continue du∣ring his Reign; we do (as our Friends of this City have already done) render the King our humble, christian, and thankful Acknowledg∣ments, not only in Behalf of our selves, but with Respect to our Friends throughout <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> and pray God with all our Hearts to bless and preserve thee, O King, and those under thee in so good a Work: And as we can assure the King it is well accepted in the Counties from whence we came, so we hope the good Effects thereof for the Peace, Trade, and Prosperity of the Kingdom will pro∣duce such a Concurrence from the Parliament, as may secure it to our Posterity in after Times, and while we live, it shall be our Endeavour (thro' God's Grace) to demean our selves, as in Conscience to God, and Duty to the King, we are obliged,</P>

<P><HI>I</HI> Thank you heartily for your Address.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer</NOTE> Some of you know (I am sure you do, Mr. <HI>Penn)</HI> that it was always my Principle, that Conscience ought not to be forced; and that all Men ought to have the Liberty of their Consciences.

<P>Here we see what the King declared to be his Intention: But per∣haps that Prince did not consider, that if such a general Liberty had been procured, he should not have been able to make it continue longer than the Popish Clergy would have thought it convenient. For who is ignorant what an unlimited Power the Roman Prelates have usurped,
<PB N="582" REF="003104_0593_0FEFF8DB47FD8C28"/>
not only in the Ecclesiastical, but also in the Political Part? Insomuch, that tho' the King's Intention might have been really sincere, yet it's like it would have been thwarted, tho' he might have been willing that it should be otherwise. That his Meaning was sincere, several I know, that were not of his Persuasion, have believed; and among these there were such, who thought that Liberty of Conscience might have been so established, that it should not have been in the Power of the Papists to break it. But Time hath shewn, that King <HI>James</HI> was not to be the Instrument for Settling such a Liberty of Conscience, and that the Repealing of the penal Laws was reserved for another Prince. Yet the King was by some thought to do what he could to stop rapacious Persecutors, and to restrain their Power, with Respect to imposing of Oaths. It is true, it was said that the King might not do so; for by granting this Liberty to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> he opened a Door for the <HI>Ro∣manists</HI> to bear Offices, without taking the required Oaths. Now that he discharged the <HI>Quakers</HI> from these Oaths, may appear by the fol∣lowing Order to the Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI></P>

<P>THE King being informed that some Goods belonging to <HI>John Wales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another to the Mayor of <HI>Leeds</HI> for re∣storing <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> Goods that had been seiz'd, and not sold</NOTE> and other <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>Leeds,</HI> which were seized and taken from them upon the Account of their religious Worship, do remain unsold in the Hands of <HI>John Todd,</HI> who was Constable at the Time of the Seisure, or in the Hands of some other Persons: And his Majesty's Intention being, that all his Subjects shall receive the full Benefit of his Declara∣tion for Liberty of Conscience, his Majesty commands me to signify his Pleasure to you, that you cause the Goods belonging to the said <HI>John Wales,</HI> and all other <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>Leeds,</HI> which were heretofore seized, upon the Account of religious Worship, and are unsold, in whose Hands soever they remain, to be forthwith restored to the respective Owners, without any Charge.

By such Means some got their Goods again, that had been taken from them upon the Account of religious Worship; for in many Places they lay long unsold, because few would buy Goods so taken. And that the King by these his Favours drew the Love and Affection of many of his Subjects towards himself, none need to wonder; for what∣ever his Religion was, he delivered them from that grievous Burden, under which they had been oppressed so many Years. To this may be added, that he used them kindly in all Respects, and would not suffer his Servants to molest any for not pulling off their Hats, when they came near his Royal Person; Nay, so far went this Condescension, that a certain Country-man of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Persuasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King suf∣fers <HI>Quakers</HI> to appear cover∣ed in his Pre∣sence.</NOTE> coming to him with his Hat on his Head, the King took off his own Hat, and held it under his Arm; which the other seeing, said, <HI>The King needs not keep off his Hat for me.</HI> To which that Prince returned, <HI>You don't know the Custom here, for that requires, that but one Hat must be on here.</HI> I have been told of more such like Occurrences, which I pass by; but it appears from thence, that the King endeavoured to have among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> the Repute of a mild and courteous Prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grants free Liberty of Con∣science also in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> And this Year he gave in <HI>Scotland</HI> also full Liberty of Conscience, and freed those that were still under Sufferings, granting them the free Liberty of their religious Meet∣ings. The said Liberty he also allowed to the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> provided they should not meet in the Fields, or in Sheds, as some did.</P>
<P>The King having thus granted Liberty of Conscience to People of all Persuasions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And endeavours to introduce Po∣pery, permitting the Jesuits a College in the <HI>Savoy,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> did whatever he could to introduce Popery in <HI>England;</HI> for he permitted the Jesuits to erect a College in the <HI>Savoy</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and suffered the Fryars to go publickly in the Dress of their Monas∣tical Orders. This was a very strange Sight to Protestants in <HI>England,</HI> and it caused no small Fermentation in the Minds of People, when the Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College at <HI>Oxford</HI> were by the King's Order dispossessed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Penn</HI> for abrogating the penal Laws, but blames the turning out the Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College.</NOTE> to make Way for <HI>Romanists.</HI> This was such a gross U∣surpation, that <HI>W. Penn,</HI> who had ready Access to the King, and who endeavoured to get the penal Laws and Test abrogated, thinking it possible to find out a Way, whereby to limit the Papists so effectu∣ally, that they should not be able to prevail, did, for all that, not omi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to blame this Usurpation at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and to tell the King, <HI>That it was an Act which could not in Justice be defended; since the general Liber∣ty of Conscience did not allow of depriving any of their Property, who did what they ought to do, as the Fellows of the said College appeared to have done.</HI> But this could not cool the King's Zeal for Popery; for he drove on fast, without Disguise, to that Degree, that the Pope's Nuncio <HI>D' Ada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Count <HI>D' Ada,</HI> Nuncio from the Pope, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes a publick Entry at <HI>Windsor.</HI></NOTE> this Summer made his publick Entry at <HI>Windsor,</HI> in very much State. Great Endeavours were now made to repeal the penal Laws and Tests; for when this Point was gained, then Papists could be admitted into the Government as well as others: And such a general Liberty of Conscience making an alluring Shew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> write against the pe∣nal Laws and Test.</NOTE> several Dis∣senters, as <HI>Baptists,</HI> and others, served the King with their Pens on this Account: And <HI>W. Penn,</HI> who always had been a Defender of Liberty of Conscience, was also not unactive in this Affair, tho' with a good In∣tent, howbeit he might have failed in his Expectation. I remember, when in those Days the Patrons of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> asserted Li∣berty of Conscience to be a Christian Duty, I heard somebody say, <HI>Can the</HI> Ethiopian <HI>change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince and Princess of <HI>O∣range</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be persuaded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o as∣sent to repealing Test, &amp;</NOTE> The King laboured also to persuade the Prince and the Princess of <HI>Orange</HI> to give their Assent to the Repealing of the Test and penal Laws; but this could not be obtained of them. And since the King caused the Advo∣cate <HI>James Stewart,</HI> to write concerning this Matter to the Heer <HI>Fagel,</HI> Counsellor, and chief Pensionary at the <HI>Hague,</HI> he answered this Paper
<PB N="584" REF="003104_0595_0FEFF8DF48E16830"/>
in a Letter to the said <HI>James Stewart,</HI> wherein he declared the Judg∣ment of the Prince and Princess in this Case, and signified, <Q>That they were willing to assent to the Repealing of the penal Laws, as far as they had any Tendency to the Exercise of Worship; but as for those that debarred Papists from sitting in Parliament, of which the Test was not the least, they could not give their Assent to the Repealing of such Limitations.</Q> This Letter was generally approved by the Protestants in <HI>England.</HI> But the King for all That, went on with the in∣troducing of Popery;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688</NOTE> and about the Beginning of the Year 1688, he not only put in several <HI>Romanists</HI> to be Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College at <HI>Oxford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romanists</HI> put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Mag∣dalen</HI> College, and others en∣deavour'd to be made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Magi∣strates.</NOTE> but endeavoured also to usher those of his Persuasion into the Magistracy; and the better to cloak this Design, he would have other Dissenters also chosen; but they generally rejected this Offer, as did also <HI>Stephen Crisp</HI> at <HI>Colchester,</HI> who was too circumspect to be caught thus, and therefore he declined the Offer.</P>
<P>The King's <HI>Declaration for Liberty of Conscience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Declara∣tion ordered to be read in Chur∣ches and Chap∣pels.</NOTE> was, on the 27th of the Month called <HI>April,</HI> published again, <HI>To shew that he was firm and constant in his Resolution, and that his Intentions were not changed since he issued it out, to excite his Subjects to join in it, and to chuse such Members of Parliament, as might do their Part to finish what he had begun.</HI> Hereto was annexed an Order of the Council, for <HI>Reading this Declaration in all Churches and Chappels throughout the Kingdom;</HI> and ordering the Bishops, <HI>to send and distribute the Declaration through∣out their several Dioceses to be read accordingly.</HI> But they refused to do so, pretending it was not legal, (tho' some there were who thought it was,) because they were against Liberty of Conscience. Now the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Bishops petition against that Order.</NOTE> and six other Bishops, petition'd the King, <Q>Not to insist on the Distribution and Reading of his Declaration, alledg∣ing, that their great Averseness to the Distribution and Publication of it in their Churches, proceeded neither from any Want of Duty and Obedience to his Majesty, nor yet from any Want of due Ten∣derness to Dissenters; but because it was founded upon such a Dis∣pensing Power, as had been often declared illegal in Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>This Refusal the King so resented, that he sent these Bishops to the Tower.<NOTE PLACE="marg">For which they are sent to the <HI>Tower.</HI></NOTE> Whilst they were thus confined, there was much Discourse every where about this Matter; and since it was well known, that some Bishops had been the Promoters of the former Persecutions, some it seems, spoke also in Prejudice of these that were now under Confine∣ment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where <HI>R. Bar∣clay</HI> makes it evident to them, that <HI>Quakers</HI> by Order from some Bishops, had been kept in Prison till Death.</NOTE> This being reported to them, they said <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>belied them, and divulged that they (the Bishops) had been the Cause of the Death of Some.</HI> This gave Occasion to <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> to visit the Bi∣shops in the <HI>Tower;</HI> and speaking with them, he gave them undeniable Proofs of some Persons, who by Order of Bishops had been kept in Prison till Death, tho' they had been told of the Danger of these Per∣sons by Physicians that were not <HI>Quakers.</HI> This was so evidently ma∣nifested by <HI>R. Barclay,</HI> that they were not able to deny it: Yet <HI>Bar∣clay</HI> told them, <HI>That since they themselves were now under Oppression, the Intention of the</HI> Quakers <HI>was in no wise to publish such Matters, lest thereby they should exasperate the King against them.</HI> And they were careful indeed not to do any Thing that might aggravate the Case of these Prisoners; for it was not Time now to rub old Sores, since the Bishops themselves seemed to be inclined to declare for Liberty of Con∣science. And since this Liberty was now enjoyed all over the King∣dom, those called <HI>Quakers</HI> thought it convenient at their Yearly Meet∣ing, which was held this Summer at <HI>London,</HI> again to draw up an Ad∣dress to the King, and to acquaint him of one Thing more, which continued to be troublesome to them. This Address they presented to him, and was as followeth;</P>

<HEAD>To King JAMES II. over <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c.
<HI>The Humble Address of the People called</HI> Quakers, <HI>from their Yearly Meeting in</HI> London, <HI>the</HI> 6th <HI>Day of the Month called</HI> June, 1688.</HEAD>
<P>WE the King's loving and peaceable Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Ad∣dress</NOTE> from divers Parts of his Dominions, being met together in this City, after our usual Manner, to inspect the Affairs of our christian Society through∣out the World, think it our Duty humbly to represent to him, the blessed Effects the Liberty he has graciously granted his People to <HI>worship God</HI> according to their Consciences, hath had, <HI>both on our Per∣sons and Estates:</HI> For whereas formerly we had ever long and sor∣rowful Lists brought to us from all Parts almost of his Territories, of Prisoners, and the Spoils of Goods, by violent and ill Men, upon Account of Conscience, <HI>We bless God, and thank the King,</HI> the Jails are every where clear, except in Cases of Tithes, and the Repairs of Parish-Churches, and some few about Oaths; and we do in all Humi∣lity lay it before the King, to consider the Hardships our Friends are yet under for Conscience-sake in those Respects, being in the one chiefly exposed to the present Anger of the offended Clergy, who have therefore lately imprison'd some of them till Death; and in the other they are <HI>rendered very unprofitable to the Publick and themselves;</HI> for both <HI>in Reference to Freedoms in Corporations, Probates of Wills and Testaments, and Administrations, Answers in Chancery, and Exchequer, Trials of our just Titles and Debts, Proceeding in our Trade at the Cus∣tom-House, Serving the Office of Constables,</HI> &amp;c. they are disabled, and great Advantages taken against them, unless the King's Favour do in∣terpose; and as we humbly hope he may relieve us, so we confident∣ly assure our selves he will ease us what he can.</P>
<P>Now since it has pleased thee, O King, to renew to all thy Sub∣jects, by thy last Declaration, thy gracious Assurances to pursue the Establishment of this Christian Liberty and Property upon an unalter∣able Foundation; and in Order to it, to hold a Parliament in <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> next at farthest:</P>
<P>We think our selves deeply engaged to renew our Assurances of Fi∣delity and Affection, and with God's Help, intend to do our Parts for the perfecting so blessed and glorious a Work; that so it may be out of the Power of any one Party to hurt another upon the Account of Conscience: And as we firmly believe that God will never desert this just and righteous Cause of Liberty, nor the King in maintaining of it, so we hope by God's Grace to let the World see we can honestly and heartily appear for Liberty of Conscience, and be inviolably true to our own Religion, whatever the Folly or Malice of some Men on that Account, may suggest to the contrary.</P>

<P>This Address being presented to the King was well received. Some have been ready to think, that the latter Part of this Address con∣cerned the Office of Magistrates, which not without Reason 'tis be∣lieved that a Christian might serve, with no more Disparagement to an inoffensive Life, than 'tis inconsistent for a pious Father to give due Correction to his rebellious Child: For tho' our Saviour charges <HI>not to re∣sist Evil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. v. 39, 44</NOTE> but <HI>to love Enemies;</HI> and that he reproving <HI>Peter,</HI> who from a forward Zeal cut off the High Priest's Servant's Ear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xviii. 11</NOTE> said to him, <HI>Put up thy Sword into the Sheath:</HI> And that also the Apostle <HI>James</HI> disap∣proves War and Fighting, yet we find in sacred Writ, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> calls the Magistrate,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <HI>the Minister of God,</HI> and <HI>a Revenger to exe∣cute

<P>But to return to my Relation, and to take up again the Thread of this History, from which I have been diverted a little by this Digres∣sion; I know there were some in those Days, who thought that if People of all Persuasions in <HI>England</HI> had a Share in the Government, proportionable to their Number, a Means might have been found out, to hinder any Party, especially the <HI>Papists,</HI> from exalting themselves a∣bove the others. But to me it seems not improbable, that if this had Effect, and a higher Hand had not cut off the Way thereto, it would have appeared that those Men did not reckon well. But it never came to this Pass, for the King's Power was tottering already, tho' he en∣deavoured to support it, even with good Means; for to be helpful to his Subjects, who, tho' free-born Men, were deprived of their Freedom, meerly because for Conscience-sake they could not swear, and to help them to this Right to which they were entitled as well as others, could not be judged undue Means, unless under it had been hidden an Intent to introduce this Liberty also in Favour of the Papists, tho' they did not believe Swearing unlawful.</P>
<P>There were now at <HI>Norwich</HI> about Forty of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who having petitioned the King, that he would be pleased to cause them to be made Freemen, obtained the following Order from him.</P>

<P>'Twas now said commonly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These Favours are ill represen∣ted, but other Affairs here mention'd were the Cause of ge∣neral Discontent.</NOTE> that the King might not do thus; and those who grudged the <HI>Quakers</HI> this Liberty, did not stick to set forth this Dispensation in very ill-favoured Colours; nay they said that <HI>William Penn</HI> advised the King to do, what he could not do without breaking his Promise. But if the King had made no greater Infringement, his Reign it may be would have lasted longer: But the Dispossessing of the Fellows of <HI>Magdalen College</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Imprisonment of the Bishops, and the publick Admittance of Jesuits and Monks, caused a Ferment in the Minds of People. Now the Bishops were tried at the King's-bench-bar, in <HI>Westminster-hall;</HI> but they were acquitted, and so released. The King
<PB N="587" REF="003104_0598_0FEFF8A06B9161A0"/>also had appointed some Ecclesiastical Commissioners; but many look'd upon this as a kind of Inquisition, and it seemed not well to agree with Liberty of Conscience, which if he had maintained justly, according to the Advice of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in their Address, it is not likely that he would have come to such a Strait, as now he was put to.</P>
<P>Not long before this Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Townsend</HI> publishes a very remarkable Ac∣count of her own and her Friends Sufferings in <HI>Glocestersh.</HI></NOTE> one <HI>Theophila Townsend,</HI> a Woman of Years and Understading, published a Book, wherein she gave a Relation of the grievous Persecution her Friends in <HI>Glocestershire</HI> had suffered, by Imprisonment and Spoil of Goods, and how she herself had also un∣dergone many Sufferings, and had been imprisoned in the Castle of <HI>Glo∣cester</HI> more than three Years. Among other Cases she relates also, how some Time before her Imprisonment it happened, that by Order of the Justices <HI>Thomas Cutler,</HI> and <HI>James George,</HI> she being seized in the Street, said to the Latter, That the Lord would plead her Cause, and that what Measure he meted, should be measured to him again. And it thus happened, that before she was released, the Wife of the said <HI>George,</HI> who took her from her Husband, was by Death taken from him. After∣wards this <HI>George</HI> came with the Bishop of <HI>Glocester</HI> into a Meeting, where <HI>Theophila</HI> was on her Knees praying: At which the Bishop asking him, Whether she was the Woman he spoke of, and he answering, <HI>Yes, my Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence of the Bishop of <HI>Glo¦cester</HI></NOTE> the Bishop took her by the Arm with such Violence, that he had almost pulled her down backward, saying, <HI>Give over, Woman, and obey the King's Officers.</HI> But such was her Zeal that it could not be stop'd; for the more Opposition she met with, the more she felt herself encou∣raged, and inspired, to praise God for his Goodness; And tho' the Bishop stirred up the Justice, yet it seemed not in his Power to break off the Current of her Speech; so that they let her alone, till she ha∣ving discharged herself, stood up. Then the Names of those that were met, were taken in Writing; and some Time after, she, tho' aged and weakly, was in Winter-season led three or four Miles thro' the Snow, and committed to Jail at <HI>Glocester,</HI> where she was kept three Years and four Months, and then released by King <HI>James.</HI> Afterward she published a Book, as hath been said already, in which she gave an Account how some of her Friends had been beaten, punch'd, and abused to that Degree, that they died of it, as she testified to have seen her∣self: <Q>Yet, said she, tho' many died who were stronger than I, it hath pleased the Lord to preserve my Life, that I may speak to the Praise of his Name, and tell of his Wonders, and put you, Persecutors, once more in Mind what belongs to your Peace. Blessed be the Lord, he is risen for <HI>Zion</HI>'s-sake, which ye have plowed long as a Field; and when her Enemies have done their Worst, then the Lord shall make his <HI>Zion</HI> to be an everlasting Glory, and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the Praise of the whole Earth. And as ye see now in others that Persecution is Evil, so see it also in your selves: Repent in Dust and Ashes.

I can truly say, in the Presence of the Lord, that I have nothing in my Heart but Love and Good-will to the worst of our Enemies, and this in Purity of Heart, and in Sincerity of Mind. I desire really your eternal Peace and Well-being, tho' ye have hardned your Hearts against the Lord, and his Truth and People. Turn to the Lord, I beseech you, bow before the Almighty, who will plead with all Flesh, and shall call all to an Account, and reward every one according to what he hath done in the Body, whether it be good or bad. Consider this therefore whilst ye have Time, and mind the Things that belong to your Peace, before they be hid from your Eyes: For the Long-suffer∣ing of the Lord will come to an End, who said, My Spirit shall not always strive with Man. Therefore whilst the Spirit of the Lord, his Light, his Grace yet strives in your Hearts, to turn you off from your evil Ways, be willing to embrace it, believe in it, take Counsel of it, submit to it with all your Heart, be willing to be led and guided by it, and incline your Hearts to follow it in all Things, and then it will lead you to Rest and Peace with the Lord for ever.</Q> Yet more she said, but I break off. By such Kind of emphatical Speeches some∣times Persecutors have been so touch'd to the Heart, that they them∣selves became harmless Christians.</P>
<P>I am come now almost to a Conclusion of my Relation concerning Persecution; of which I could have written much more, but that I was unwilling to extend my Work beyond what I should have been well able to compleat. Yet before I altogether part with this Matter, I will mention something concerning <HI>Theophilus Green,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sufferings of <HI>T. Green,</HI> &amp; notable Deliver∣ances from the Malice of his Enemies.</NOTE> of whom mention hath been made before. He liv'd at <HI>Battorsea,</HI> not far from <HI>London,</HI> and was a Man beloved of his Neighbours, because of his honest Conver∣sation; yet he was much persecuted, both for attending Meetings, and for Preaching. Once it happened that some Officers came to his House to see whether there was a Meeting, and they behaved themselves mo∣derately: For what they did seemed against their Mind, it being only in Obedience to the Order of Justice <HI>Duke,</HI> who on Account of a former Offence, had issued out Warrants to make Distress. The Officers not satisfied in the Case, and seeing no Meeting, went their Way, and re∣turned the Warrant; and <HI>T. Green</HI> went afterwards to the said Justice, and speaking to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His plain Dealing with Justice <HI>Duke,</HI> and the Effe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> said amongst the rest. <HI>Consider what that Mouth and Tongue of thine hath said formerly,</HI> viz. <HI>That I had been very kind to thee, and is this the Way of requiting it? Know for certain, That that God whom I have served, and for whose Cause I now suffer, will avenge me; for Vengeance is the Lord's and he will repay it, one Way or other, except thou speedily repentest.</HI> At this Saying the Justice began to trem∣ble,
<PB N="589" REF="003104_0600_0FEFF924E00D8D18"/>and crying out, said, <HI>I will do you no more Hurt than I will do my own Soul. Pray go to the Officers, and tell them, I will never trouble them any more upon the Account of you. Green</HI> did so, and they were glad of it. And <HI>Duke</HI> being upon some Complaint dismissed, one Sir <HI>John Broadrick</HI> succeeded in his Room; and he was so moderate, that he prevented the Informers, by keeping <HI>Theophilus</HI> and his Friends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of their Meeting-house, which was for about two Years and a half. Afterwards they were suffered again to go into their Meeting-house, but then Justice <HI>Foster</HI> came once, and taking their Names, fined <HI>The∣ophilus</HI> 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> as a Preacher. And afterwards he with others coming with a Constable to seize for the Fine, the Constable being come to the Door of the House said, <HI>Neighbour</HI> Green, <HI>where are you? we are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to seize your Goods, if you will let us in.</HI> But this so displeased the Ju∣stice, that going down the Yard, and seeing some Oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Poles, he required the Constable to take them away. To which he answered, <HI>I am no Porter.</HI> Then said the Justice, <HI>Command some others to do it.</HI> To which the Constable returned, <HI>I command you to do it.</HI> This so enrag'd the Justice, that he fined him. Sometime after, the said Justice com∣ing again with an High Constable, and another, a petty Constable, seized a Barge, and had it carried away, and several Times offered it to Sale, but none would buy it. And after it had been carried about from Place to Place for Sale, at length it was found adrift, by one who knew not of its being seized; and hearing that it was <HI>Theophilus</HI>'s Barge, he brought it to him. But <HI>Theophilus</HI> went to the Constables, and told them how it came to him, and where he had it, saying, <HI>Since it was come to him again, he was willing to keep it; but if they took it away a∣gain, he would not hinder them.</HI> This Account being given to the Ju∣stice, he sent a Warrant, and committed <HI>Theophilus</HI> to the <HI>Marshalsea</HI> Prison. After three Weeks the Sessions was held at the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> and the last Day the said Justice came to him in the Prison, saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Severity and Hypocrisy of Justice <HI>For¦ster.</HI></NOTE> <HI>He came out of Love to see him, and to advise him for his Good;</HI> which was, <HI>that he would Love him pay his Fine:</HI> For, said he, <HI>I am sure the Grand Jury hath found the Bill against you; and if you should come off, I have such an Influence with the Judge, as to cause the Oath to be tender'd to you; and I know you will not take it; and then you will be run to a</HI> Premunire, <HI>and are not like to come out as long as you live.</HI> To which <HI>Theophilus</HI> answered, <HI>Thou saidst thy coming was in Love, to advise me for my Good; but by what thou hast said, it appears the contrary: For now I perceive thou hast de∣vised as much Mischief as thou canst against me. As to the Fine, if it were but ten Pence, nay, ten Farthings, I would not pay it. And if the Lord should permit thee to do as thou hast said, and so be the Cause of bringing my grey Hairs the sooner to the Grave, my Blood will be at Justice</HI> For∣ster's <HI>Door, and it will cry Vengeance against thee.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day the two Constables being called before the Grand Ju∣ry, were asked, <HI>What they had against</HI> Theophilus Green, <HI>that stood there indicted:</HI> And the High Constable answered, <HI>As to</HI> Theophilus Green, <HI>he is as honest a Man, tho' a</HI> Quaker, <HI>as lives about us; and he was lately in Office for the Poor, and behaved himself as well in it as any hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these twenty Years. And touching the Barge he is indicted for, when it came to him, he came to us, and told how it came, and where he had laid it, saying, if we would take it away again, he would not hinder us. This is all we have to say.</HI> Some of the Grand Jury knowing <HI>Theophilus</HI> very well, and the Cause too, did aggravate the Matter very high a∣gainst the Justice: And as to the Indictment, they brought it in <HI>Ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣ramus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theophilus</HI> cleared, and tho advised by Sir <HI>R. How</HI> to sue <HI>Foster</HI> decline.</NOTE> So <HI>Theophilus</HI> was cleared by Proclamation; and Sir <HI>Richard How,</HI> being one of the Jury, advised him to arrest the Justice, there being two good Actions, as Defamation and false Imprisonment. But <HI>Theophilus</HI> said, <HI>He owned their Love, but would leave the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing to the
<PB N="590" REF="003104_0601_0FEFF8E3DDE3EAA0"/>Lord, for whose Cause he suffered; for Vengeance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and he would repay it.</HI> And it was but some little Time after, that the said Justice <HI>Forster</HI> died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In a little Time after, 'tis said <HI>Forster</HI> dy∣ed in Horror.</NOTE> as was reported, in great Horror and Misery. The Time when this happened I do not know exactly, yet I take it to have been some Years before the Time I now describe. We see by this In∣stance a very singular Deliverance, such as did not befal every one, but which could not but encourage <HI>Theophilus</HI> the more.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Penn</HI> Leaving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the publick Miscarriages, and being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in some as a Papist, at the serious Request of some Person, answers those Accusations.</NOTE> I most mention something concerning <HI>W. Penn,</HI> who, when the Government of King <HI>James</HI> was sinking, not only bore the Blame of many Miscarriages, but by some was stiled a Papist, tho' this was altogether false. But he had a great many Ene∣mies; and it was no new Thing to brand the <HI>Quakers</HI> with the odious Name of Jesuits: For thirty Years before this Time at <HI>Bristol,</HI> great Endeavours were used to persuade People they were Franciscans. <HI>W. Penn</HI> patiently bore the Slander of being decried as a Papist, saying but little in Justification of himself, till at length he made a Return to a Letter sent by one who seriously begg'd of him to give an Answer to those Accusations that had been forged in Prejudice of his Reputation. In this Paper, <Q>He ascribed his free Access to the King, partly to the Relation his Father, as Admiral, had to the Service of the said King, who was then Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and High Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> and his special Favour also in releasing him out of the Tower of <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1669.</Q> To this he added, <HI>My Father's humble Request to him upon his Death-bed was, to protect me from the Inconveniences and Trou∣bles my Persuasion might expose me unto; and his friendly Promise to do it, and exact Performance of it, from the Moment I address'd my self to him: I say, when all this is considered, any Body that hath the least Pretence to Good-nature, Gratitude, or Generosity, must needs know how to interpret my Access to the King.—Is any thing more foolish as well as false, than that because I am often at</HI> Whitehall, <HI>therefore I must be Author of all that is done there, that doth not please abroad. But supposing some such Things to have been done; pray tell me if I am bound to oppose any Thing I am not called to do? I never was a Member of Council, Cabinet, or Committee, where the Affairs of the Kingdom are transacted. I have had no Office or Trust, and consequently nothing can be said to be done by me; nor, for that Reason, could I lie under any Test or any Obligation to discover my Opinion of publick Acts of State: And therefore, neither can any such Acts, nor any Silence about them, in Justice be made my Crime. Volunteers are Blanks and Cyphers in all Governments. And unless calling at</HI> Whitehall <HI>once a Day, upon many Occasions, or my not being turned out of nothing, (for that no Office is) be the Evidence of my Compliance in disagreeable Things, I know not what else can with any Truth be alledged against me. — I am not without Apprehensions of the Cause of this Behaviour towards me; I mean my constant Zeal for an impartial Liberty of Conscience. But if that be it, the Cause is too good to be in Pain about it. I ever understood that to be the natural Right of all Men; and that he that had a Religion with∣out it, his Religion was one of his own Make. For what is not the Religion of a Man's Choice, is the Religion of him that imposes it: So that Liberty of Conscience is the first Step to have a Religion. This is no new Opinion with me, I have writ many Apologies within the last Twenty Years to defend it, and that impartially. Yet I have as constantly declared that Bounds ought to be set to this Freedom, and that Morality was the best; and that as often as that was violated under a Pretence of Conscience, it was fit the Civil Power should take Place. Nor did I ever once think of promoting any Sort of Liberty of Conscience for any body, which did not preserve the common Protest∣ancy of the Kingdom, and the ancient Rights of the Government: For to say Truth, the one cannot be maintained without the other.— And till I saw my
<PB N="591" REF="003104_0602_0FEFF928728B54C0"/>own Friends, with the Kingdom, delivered from the Legal Bondage which Penal Laws for Religion had subjected them to, I could with no Satisfaction think of leaving</HI> England, <HI>tho' much to my Prejudice beyond Sea, and at my great Expence here, having in all this Time neither had either Office or Pension, and always refusing the Rewards or Gratuities of those I have been able to oblige.</HI> From this little Abstract of <HI>W. Penn</HI>'s Apology, it appears sufficiently what kind of Liberty he defended; And such a Liberty after∣wards took Place in the Reign of the next King.</P>
<P>Of <HI>G. Fox</HI> I have been long silent,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. F.</HI> continu∣ally employed in the Care of the Church.</NOTE> and I do not meet with any very remarkable Transaction that concerned him, except that he writ much, both for Edification of his Friends, and for Instruction and Ad∣monition of others; for he was continually occupied with the Care of the Church, and that Things might be kept in good Order, which to perform the better, he now staid a long while in and about <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>In this Year died <HI>William Dewsbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A short Rela∣tion of the Con∣vincement, Suf∣ferings, Service and pious End of <HI>W. Dews¦bury.</HI></NOTE> one of the first Preachers among those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> having been a very zealous Teacher, and an emi∣nent Instrument to the Conversion of many. He was born in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and in his Youth was a Shepherd, and afterwards put Apprentice to a Clothier; but when the Civil Wars broke out, he became a Soldier, and joined with those who said they sought for the Gospel. Now tho' he was religious according to his Knowledge, yet growing more and more serious, and turning his Mind inwardly, he saw there were inward and spi∣ritual Enemies to encounter with, according to the Saying of the Apostle, <HI>We wrestle not against Flesh and Blood, but against spiritual Wickedness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. vi. 12.</NOTE> &amp;c. And this State was inwardly manifested to him in the Words of our Sa∣viour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xviii. 11, 36.</NOTE> <HI>Put up thy Sword into thy Sheath. If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight.</HI> This wrought so powerfully upon his Mind, that he could no longer meddle with martial Affairs, but left the Army, and returned to his former Calling, endeavouring to improve in true Godliness, in which he so advanced gradually, that when <HI>G. F.</HI> in the Year 1651, came to <HI>Balby</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and preached the Gospel there, he could not but consent to the Doctrine declared by him, as be∣ing the same of which he himself was already convinced in his Mind, <HI>viz.</HI> That Heed ought to be given to the inward divine Reprovings for that which is evil, which Doctrine was preached by <HI>G. F.</HI> under the De∣nomination of <HI>the true Light which enlightneth every Man coming into the World.</HI> And that Heed must be given thereunto, as being <HI>the Grace which brings Salvation,</HI> of which the Apostle speaks in his Epistle to <HI>Titus</HI> ii. 11. saying, <HI>That it hath appeared to all Men. W. Dewsbury</HI> having heard such a Sermon as this, agreed not only with <HI>G. F.</HI> in this Point of Doctrine, but in Process of Time became himself also a very zealous Preacher of it, for which he fell under great Sufferings; insomuch that he was Prisoner at <HI>Warwick</HI> nineteen Years for Religion-sake,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>19</HI> Years a Prisoner at <HI>Warwick</HI> be∣sides at other Places</NOTE> besides the Imprison∣ments he suffered on that Account in other Places. But being now re∣leased, he came in the Month called <HI>May,</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> and preached a Sermon there concerning Regeneration, which was taken from his Mouth in Short-hand, and afterwards printed as underneath.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<HEAD><HI>A Sermon preached by</HI> William Dewsbury, <HI>at</HI> Grace-church-street, <HI>the sixth of the third Month,</HI> 1688.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Except ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e regenerated and born again, ye cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>THis is the Word of the Lord God to all People this Day; this lies not in any Pro∣fession, and in vain Imagination, and whatsoever else it is that you d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k your selves withal; you must every particular Man and Woman be born again, else <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This was the Doctrine of Christ in that prepared Body wherein he appeared in the World, and preached to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> that standing Doctrine to this Moment of Time, and will be so while any Man breath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the Earth; there is no other Way, no other Gate to enter into Life, but by this great Work of <HI>Regeneration.</HI> Now to enforce People to come to this great Work, and to see forward from Earth to Heaven, all being driven out of Paradice by the Cherubim set with a flaming Sword, there is no returning to that blessed Life, but by the Loss of that Life that did grieve the Spirit of God, and which did cause Man to be driven out; there is no other Way of return again but by this new Birth. As you are all driven and forced out of Paradice, and the flaming Sword and the Cherubims are set to keep the Way of the Tree of Life, so you must return into the Favour of God again, by the Light of Christ, and you have Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a little, and there a little, to direct your Minds to the Light of Christ Jesus. As the first <HI>Adam</HI> was made a living Soul, so the second <HI>Adam</HI> is a quickning Spirit. This know for certain, no Man or Woman can be quickned, and raised up into the Life of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> till the Life of the first <HI>Adam</HI> be taken away from them.</P>
<P>So now, let every one of you deal plainly with your own Hearts, how you came to be a slain People to the Life of the first <HI>Adam,</HI> in which Life there was a Working of the Mystery of Iniquity in every Part of Man. One cries, Lo here is Christ, another, Lo there is Christ, and every one is following his own Imagination about the Letter of the Scripture; this is still but the vain Spirit of Man, running and striving to recover him∣self; and this is the Cause there is so much Profession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, and so little of his Nature appearing among the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now all of you that come to be Regenerated, you must come to the Light of Christ, there is no other Way to it. He will search your Hearts, and try your Reins, and set your Sins in Order before you, and trace out the Iniquities that compass you about; therefore you must see your selves a lost People, a sinful People, and so come to feel the Weight of your Sins upon your Consciences, there is no other Way to come to Life; you will never complain of Sin till you be burthened with it, till you have a Trumpet sounding in your Ears, to awaken you, that you may arise from the Dead, that Christ may give you Light; there is no other Way, dear People, you must bring your Deeds to the Light of Christ, and abide in the Sen∣tence of Condemnation; if you save your Lives, you lose them; if you will lose your Lives for Christ's sake, there is no Danger of your eternal Life. <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, Christ's Forerunner, declared, <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, the Latchet of whose Shoes I am not worthy to unloose, he shall bap∣tize you with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire, whose Fan is in his Hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquench∣able Fire.</HI> What is it the better for you to read the Scripture if you know not this fiery Baptism, which all must know that are regenerated; deceive not your selves, Christ will <HI>appear in flaming Fire, and take Vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>I stand here as a Witness of the Lord of Life this Day, there is no Way for People to come to Salvation, but they must know Christ revealed in all their Hearts. What is he doing but rendring Vengeance upon the carnal Mind, self pleasing, and all inordinate Affections; he comes with Vengeance to take away thy Life, he will baptize thee with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire. If thou knowest not this, thou art not a true Christian, thou wilt never look Death in the Face with Joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph. If thou livest at home in the Body, and flyest for thy Life, and wilt not be willing to lose thy Life for Christ, if thou art called to it, and if thou wilt nor have Christ to wash thee (some for Shyness, and some for Self-love will refuse this) if Christ doth not wash thee, thou hast no Part in him; you must come to Christ to purify you in the fiery Furnace; <HI>the Day of the Lord shall burn as an Oven,</HI> (as the Prophet speaks) this is a dreadful Day, a Day of Vengeance, the Day of the Lord Jesus Christ, who redeemeth his People from their Sins, <HI>Sion is redeemed with Judgment, and established with Righteousness.</HI> Do not make the Way to Heaven easier in your Minds and Imaginations than indeed it is, and think it not sufficient to live in an outward Observance of the Ways of God. If your own Wills be alive, and your Corruption remain unmortified, the Judgment of God will be your Portion, therefore in the Lord's Name come along with me, I am come to declare what I have heard and seen of the Father. Come and examine thy Conscience, hast thou brought thy Deeds to the Light? then thou hast received Condemnation upon thy self, and thy Haughtiness is bowed down, and laid low, and thou seest thy self a poor miserable Wretch before the eternal God. Whatsoever thou knowest of the Mind of God, hast thou reformed thy Ways? Come along with me, and tell me what is the Ground of thy Faith, and thy Confidence; is it thy Obedience and Qualifications? Because thy Obedience is right, and thy Qualifications right, what Use dost thou make of them? Read the Book of Conscience; hast thou no Ground for thy Faith? Thou hast put on the reformed Faith, and livest an unreformed Life; search and try thy self, Man, or Woman. Dost thou watch over thy self, and keep in a Sense of thy Dissolution, notwithstanding all thy Qualifications and partial Reformation? Dost thou <HI>strive to enter in at the strait Gate, and the narrow Way?</HI> Here is the lost Sheep, thou seekest, the Life of thy Will, the Life of the first <HI>Adam;</HI> the Justice of God will not suffer thee to make a Saviour of thy Duties and Qualifications, and to take God's Jewels and to deck thy self with them; thou canst not be saved with∣out the Righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. What saith thy Conscience, art thou brought to this Change of thy Mind, and of thy Conversation? Are you all willing to part with your Sins, with your Pride and Haughtiness? Are you willing to part with your vile Affec∣tions? This is the Work of God's Grace upon you. Dost thou place thy Confidence in thy Duties and Qualifications, and takest God's Jewels and Ornaments and deckest thy self with them? <HI>Thou tookest my Jewels,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>and didst play the Harlot.</HI> If thou return to the Lord, and humble thy self, and get thro' this Difficulty, thou wilt be happy for∣ever. This Judgment of God, this flaming Sword that turns every Way, will keep thee from returning to Sin, and bring thee to Christ, and cut thee off from all Hope of Salvation but by him, and make thee to see the absolute need of a Saviour, and that thy <HI>Life is hid with Christ in God.</HI></P>
<P>It is God's infinite Goodness to Men that he will hide Pride from them, and humble them under his mighty Hand. This is the Condition of poor Creatures that are slain by the Hands of the most High: How may I know when I am slain and baptized, and come to have Sincerity? They that have this Baptism enter into the Heavenly Life. If you love the Light of Christ Jesus, it will be thus with you; God will make short work in the Earth. He will set thy Sins in order before thee, and make thee watchful unto Prayer, and lead thee to Holiness of Life and Conversation, and make thee abhor thy self, and despise all the Pomps and Pleasures and Vanities of this World. When he hath adorned thee with his Graces, then watch for the Light, and in the Light of Christ thou shalt see Light, and that all thou hast done, and canst do, is but thy Duty. All this thou oughtest to do; thou art God's Creature, and all this will not justifie thee in order to thy Eternal Salvation, for these Services thou owest unto God. If thou diligently wait, thou shalt see more Light; then the Sword that proceeds out of the Mouth of Christ, who is called the Word of God, will cut thee off from all thy Hopes of Salvation from any Thing thou hast done, from any of thy Qualifications, from any Thing that thou canst do, so that thou wilt be a hopeless Soul, nothing in thy own Sense and Apprehension. The Power of the first <HI>Adam</HI> must die before him, and thou wilt cry out, I am a dead, lost, and undone Creature, but there is a Life hid with Christ in God for me; but I can never have it till I be slain into the Will of God, and become as a little Child, and be stript of all my own Excellency that I have attained. I must come to a Sense of my own Misery, and fall down at the Foot of God; when I am become as a little Child, humbled and slain as to my own Will, and Confidence in my own Righteousness; I will not then question but I shall live a holy Life, but I will give all that Life I had, for that <HI>Life which is hid with Christ in God;</HI> O! there is none come so far, that ever miss of Eternal Life. All shuffling People that would have Salvation by Christ, and will not let him exercise his heavenly Power, his princely glorious Power to baptize them into his Death, it is they that come short of Salvation; but all those that yield themselves up to Christ to be redeemed thro' Judgment, and are become as little Children, these are in a happy State. You know that our Lord Jesus Christ took a little Child in his Arms, and said. Whosoever becomes not as a little Child, cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea¦ven. You must all of you become as little Children, and depend upon the Mercy and free Grace of God; you must all come to a holy Resignation of your selves to God's Disposal. If you come to Christ as little Children, and depend upon him, you cannot miss of Salva∣tion; it is entailed upon such Souls as hear the Voice of Christ; they that hear the Voice of the Son of God shall live.</P>
<P>I stand here as a Witness for the God of Heaven. I never heard the Voice of Christ (as his Follower, till I was slain and baptized, and lay as a little Child under his Heavenly Chastisements. Assoon as ever my Soul was brought to this in my Humiliation, O then the dreadful Judgment was taken away, and the Book of Life was opened unto me, and the Lord spake comfortably to me, <HI>I have loved thee with an everlasting Love;</HI> and I was made a Christian thro' a Day of Vengeance, and of burning as an Oven; and the Haughtiness and Pride of Man in me was brought low. Now in this Conformity to Christ's Death, People may die into Life, and blessed are the Dead that die in the Lord, for they rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them. Away with all your own Will, and your Pride, and Haughtiness, and your Hypocrisy, and Deceit, and all Dependancy upon any Qualification of your own. You must come to have your Life separated from you, else you will all perish. Those that will die with Christ, and be willing to die for him, he is re∣vealed as a Saviour to them. He was before us in the Days of his Flesh, and complied with his Father's Will, he was nailed to the Cross. The Son of God, when he was come to the Depth of his Sufferings, what was his Cry? <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> This was for thy Sake, and my Sake, and every Man and Woman's Sake that do be∣lieve in him; he drank the Cup which his Father gave him to drink; <HI>If it was done thus to the green Tree, what shall be done unto the dry?</HI> He went before us, and when he cometh a∣gain he will take us to himself, and take us from the Filth of Sin, that we may be made new Creatures.</P>
<P>Now except we be born again, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, and there is no becoming new Creatures, till we be slain to the old Man. Thou must be slain to thy Pride and Haughtiness, and the Corruption of thine own Will, and all Selfishness, thou must have God to burn it up in thee; the Holy Ghost will destroy and burn up nothing in thee, but that which will bring an eternal Fire upon thy Soul; shew me, thou whom my Soul lo∣veth, where is the Path of Life, the Foot-steps of the Flock of thy Companions? Why should I be as one that goes aside? Now every one that lives at home in the Bosom of Self, take this with you, Tho' you profess the Truth, and live in an outward Conformity thereunto, yet if you secretly indulge your corrupt Wills, and live a Flesh-pleasing Life, and consult with Flesh and Blood, and are not rent off from your Lusts, you cannot enjoy the Lord of Life; <HI>While I am at home in the Body, I am absent from the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The Body of Sin is a Loadstone to draw you from the Life of God, and from glorying in the Cross of Christ: This is Flesh and Blood, and <HI>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the King∣dom of God.</HI> For the Lord's Sake, for your Soul's Sake, and for the Sake of your Eternal Happiness, put not off this Work, but pursue it, and it will be perfected. <HI>See how Christ is revealed in you by the Holy Ghost, and with Fire.</HI> God will <HI>redeem you by the Spirit of Judg∣ment and Burning:</HI> It is not ranging abroad with your Minds, but you must know <HI>Christ is in you except ye he Reprobates.</HI> If he hath set your Eyes and Hearts upon himself, and made you to <HI>water your Couch with your Tears;</HI> if he hath broken your Sleep, so as you have cry'd out, I shall be damned and never come to Salvation; (This will be your Cry, it was once my Cry,) O let not your Eyes slumber, nor your Eyelids take any Rest, till you be sure the Lord is your God. If you find these Qualifications, you are on your Way, otherwise you will be like a deceitful Bow, and never abide in Judgment. If you reject the Counsel of God against your selves, and refuse to be crucified with Christ, and to be baptized with his Baptism, you will never have Life; but by his Baptism, and thro' the heavenly Operation of his Spirit, if thou hast Faith in Christ's Name, thou shalt be married to him in everlasting Righteousness. Salvation shall be brought to us, and eternal. Life be bestowed upon us, even that Life which is hid with Christ in God, he will give to every poor mournful Soul, that submits to his blessed Will, and believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ: This is not a Faith of our own making, nor a Garment of our own Em∣broidery, but that which the Lord hath given to us. O happy Man or Woman, that obtainest this Gift of God! O! Who will not lose their Lives for this everlasting Life? Who will not die for this eternal Life? Now the Matter lies in the Death of your own Wills, when you have done the Will of God, then watch that your own Wills be slain, and that your cursed Self take not the Jewels of God, and his Bracelets and Ornaments, and bestow them upon Self, and paint and deck cursed Self; and take not the Members of Christ, and make them the Members of an Harlot: If you be dead to your own Wills you are risen with Christ, and shall receive a Resurrection to eternal Life: Crucifie Self, and set the World at nought, and trample upon it, and all Things of it, and count them as Dross and Dung in comparison of Christ, that the Father hath revealed to be our Life, in the Days of our Sorrow and Mourning, in the Day of our Calamity, in the Day when we cried, our Hope is lost.</P>
<P>Thus it hath been with the holiest People on Earth. It is not by Works of Righteous∣ness of thy own that thou canst be saved; Christ comes to cut all these down, that thou mayst be ingrafted into him, and justified by his Grace. Do not make this Matter of Talk, and say, I have heard this and that, but look into your own Hearts, and see what heavenly Workings are there; what there is of the Power of the Lord Jesus, that hath made you to loath this World, and the inordinate Love of the Creature, that you may enjoy all these Things, as if you enjoyed them not. We cannot when we are slain and crucified to this World, but say, My Life is in Christ, when we come to ascribe nothing to our selves, and all to Christ; here is a blessed Harmony, broken Hearts, melted Spi∣rits, and yet joyful Souls; poor Creatures that were mourning and sighing, and crying before the Lord in retired Places, and yet rejoicing in Christ Jesus. I am risen with Christ, I said, my Hope is cut off, I will lie down in thy Will, O God; do what thou wilt with me, it is in thy sovereign Pleasure and free Gift, whether thou give me Life, or deny it to me. There must be a Resignation of our selves to the Will of God; it was so with the Lord Jesus, and it is so with every true Saint of God; you must be humbled as little Children before Judgment be taken away, and the Loving-kindness of God sealed up to your Souls. If you seek this Work of God, you will find it; if you seek it upon your Beds, in all your Labours and Concernments, in all your Stations and Relations; if you press after the New Birth, you must use this World, as if you used it not, and live a married Life, as if you were unmarried, for the Fashion of this World passeth away. This is not Rantism.</P>
<P>But let me tell you, a New World comes by Regeneration; a Man is not lifted up in his own Mind, but laid low in his own Eyes, he waits for the Wisdom of God to govern him, and he is as a Steward of the Grace of God, to give to them that stand in need. When a Man is regenerated and born again, he is as contented with Bread and Water, as with all the Enjoyments of this World: What is the Matter? His own Will is gone, and put down under his Feet, and whatsoever it is that gives Life to all his vain Desires and Affections, there is a Harmony of all within, a Man praising of God, and blessing his Holy Name; there are no Intanglements shall draw away the Heart from serving of God, and seeking his Glory; and if God shall call the Husband from the Wife, or the Wife from the Husband for the Glory of his Name, there is no whining, and complain∣ing, and crying out, but giving them up, and a praising and blessing God when they are called to such an Exercise; and if they are not called to that, then they set their Hearts to glorifie God in their several Places and Stations; then they have a full Content in a blessed Resignation. Here their Wills are slain, but they praise God they have no De∣sire, but Lord thy Will be done; always praising God, always having the Fear, and the Glory of God before their Eyes. All the Mischief is hatch'd in pleasing Mens own Wills: That is, the Counsel of every Heart that Christ doth not govern: Will you live as the <HI>Quakers?</HI> Then you must live contemptibly, the Mistress and Maid are Hail-fel∣low, well met. No, every one must walk in Humility, and live in Acquaintance with the God of Heaven; she that is wrought upon by the same Spirit, must with all Diligence behave herself as becomes a Servant of the Lord. Here is now a New World, and the Fashions of the Old World are gone; all Pride, Haughtiness, Crossness and trampling upon one another are all gone, all slain, thro' the Operation of Christ.</P>
<P>What remains now? Christ is in me, and we are all one in him. Christ laid down his Life for thee and me; now he reigns in me, and he hath prepared my Body to die for the Truth, as his prepared Body was laid down for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Sin. It is a kind of foolish Pro∣fession, to make Profession of Christ, and live in Covetousness, Profaneness, Sensuality, and the like; they that are come to this heavenly Birth seek the Things that are above, thou canst do no other. <HI>Make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good.</HI> You must be in∣grafted into the Vine of God's Righteousness: O! slight not the Day of your Visitation. What was it to me to read of any being born again, till I was slain, and knew the hea∣venly Baptism of Christ Jesus? Till I saw the flaming Sword ready to slay me in every Way, in every Turning. The Light of Christ convinced me of Sin, and his Righteous∣ness justified me, and those Works were abominable to me, that hindred my Soul's Pas∣sage to Christ. Christ Jesus in marrying my Soul to himself, seized upon me, and did work effectually in me: There is the Testimony of Christ in me, he hath sealed up my Soul to the Day of my Redemption: Here is a certain Passage, and a certain Way which never any miss of, that lose their Lives for Christ: If you be not ready and willing to lose your Lives for Christ, you shall never come here: The Gate is straight, and the Way is narrow; none come hither but those that die into a heavenly Oneness with Christ. O Friends, let us empty our selves, that Christ may fill us; let us be nothing in our own Eyes, that we may be all in him, and receive of his Fulness.</P>
<P>Now I commend you to God's Witness, that you may remember what hath been spo∣ken among you; but consider, if you do not hearken to it, it will follow you, and be a Plague to you to all Eternity. If you will not yield up your selves to Christ this Day that burns like an Oven, this Fire you must dwell with when out of the Body, there will be no quenching of this Fire for ever; but if you be so wise for your Souls, as to resign your selves up to Christ, and come to him as little Children, this will not hinder your earthly Concerns. Tho' the World may account thee a Fool, yet thou hast that Part of heavenly Wisdom, to do what thou dost as unto God; thou carriest to thy Wife, as in the sight of God, that she may be sanctified to thee, and thou to her; and thou carriest be∣comingly to thy Children and Servants, and thou wilt abound in Grace, and in every good Work, which will be for thine Eternal Welfare.</P>
<P>O! I beseech you People, for the Lord's sake, wait for the Light of Christ to guide you; learn of him to be meek and lowly, then happy are you; for <HI>he dwelleth with the Humble, but he beholdeth the Proud afar off.</HI> This New Birth, which is a true Work, a sincere and heavenly Work, it will make you for ever. O make Room for Christ in your Hearts, or else he is never like to dwell with you. He loveth to dwell with the poor and humble and contrite Spirit, he abhors the Proud, he will empty your Souls, that he may fill them.</P>
<P>And so I commend you to God. I have been long held in Durance under great Weak∣ness; and I was restless, till I could come up to this great City of <HI>London,</HI> to preach the Everlasting Gospel among you, and you see I am among you here: Pray every one of you turn inward; let not these Words passing thro' a mean Vessel be as a bare empty Discourse of Truth to you, which you only hear, and take no further Care of your Sal∣vation. Take heed of despising the Light that shines in the midst of you, and be pressing forward to the heavenly Work that is laid in the Power of Christ Jesus, even thro' Judg∣ment into Death, and then he will give eternal Life. The Lord confirm this, that it may rest upon your Hearts, that you may be dead to the Things of the World. <HI>We are not come to Mount</HI> Sinai, <HI>that genders to Bondage, but we are come to Mount</HI> Sion, <HI>the City of the Li∣ving God, the heavenly</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the general Assem∣bly, and Church of the First-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of just Men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, that speaketh better Things than that of</HI> Abel. This is the Inheritance of the Redeemed of the most High, blessed be the Name of the Lord; let us rest in Hope, till he bring us to Humility and Lowliness of Mind, that he may cloath us with heavenly Glory, according to his Promise, <HI>I will beautifie my House with Glory, saith the Lord.</HI> This is the Portion of a poor People, that cast down themselves before the Lord, that he may lift them up, and be all in all to them, in whose blessed <HI>Presence they shall have Joy, and Rivers of Pleasures at his Right hand for evermore.</HI></P>

Intention was to have been at the Yearly Meeting of his Friends; but by Illness he was prevented; and therefore before he grew worse, he returned to <HI>Warwick,</HI> where he liv'd. Being come thither, his Disease increased; and lying very sick in Bed, and being visited by some of his Friends, he said to them, in great Weakness of Body, as followeth:</P>
<P><PB N="593" REF="003104_0604_0FEFF92BB0B18F98"/><HI>My God hath yet put it in my Heart to bear a Testimony to his Name and blessed Truth, and I can never forget the Day of his great Power and blessed Appearance, when he first sent me to preach the Everlasting Gos∣pel,</HI>

<PB N="595" REF="003104_0606_0FEFF92DF358AB28"/><HI>the Prison-house I sang Praises to my God, and esteemed the Bolts and Locks upon me as Jewels. And Friends, this I must once again testify to you in the Name of the Lord God, That what I saw above thirty Years</HI>
<PB N="596" REF="003104_0607_0FEFF8EBAC167020"/><HI>ago, still rests as a Testimony to leave behind me, That a dreadful terrible Day is at hand, and will certainly come to pass; but the Time when, I cannot say; but all put on Strength in the Name of the Lord, and wait to feel his eternal Power, to preserve you thro' the Tribulations of those Days that approach very near. This I have further to signify, that my Depar∣ture draws nigh. Blessed be my God. I am prepared, and I have nothing to do but die, and put off this corruptible and mortal Tabernacle, this Flesh that hath so many Infirmities; but the Life that dwells in it, ascends out of the Reach of Death, Hell, and the Grave; and Immortality and eter∣nal Life is my Crown for ever. Therefore you that are left behind, fear not, nor be discouraged, but go on in the Name and Power of the Lord, and bear a faithful and living Testimony for him in your Day. And the Lord will prosper his Work in your Hand, and cause his Truth to flourish, and spread abroad. For it shall have the Victory, and no Weapon formed against it shall prosper.</HI></P>
<P>Thus fervent in Spirit was <HI>W. Dewsbury</HI> in his latter End, and he prayed to God very earnestly for all his Friends, especially those that were met at the Annual Assembly at <HI>London.</HI> And so he very piously departed this Life at his House, in a good old Age, in the Month called <HI>June,</HI> in this current Year. He was indeed a Man of a remarkable Zeal and Perception. He spoke sometimes to young Lads as to Men, tel∣ling them that the Blessing of the Lord would rest upon them if they lived a godly Life; some of which being since come to Man's Estate, have experienced the Truth of his Saying.</P>
<P>Two Days before the Decease of <HI>W. Dewsbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>R. Travers.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Rebecca Travers</HI> de∣parted this Life, at about the Age of 79 Years. She was a Woman ex∣ceedingly well gifted; and spoke not only sometimes in publick for Edification of the Church, but writ also several Books for the Advance∣ment of Piety; in one of which she signified, <HI>That tho' she had been a Reader of the Scriptures from a Child of six Years old; yet when by the Power of the eternal Gospel she was turned from Darkness to Light, the Scriptures then became much more plain to her, as not wanting Interpreta∣tion.</HI> She was an excellent open-hearted Woman, and took great Care
<PB N="597" REF="003104_0608_0FEFF9318E5AC630"/>of the Poor: She had several Times been imprisoned for Religion, but persevered constantly in the Faith, and so piously entred into eternal Rest.</P>
<P>As to State Affairs, there now appeared a wonderful Agitation in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> since it was reported that the Queen was big with Child. And the Endeavours for introducing Popery, besides the incroaching upon some Rights and Privileges, caused such a Stir, that <HI>William</HI> the Third, Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and <HI>Stadholder</HI> (or Lord-Deputy) of <HI>Holland,</HI> &amp;c. was intreated and invited by the <HI>English</HI> Protestants to come to their Assist∣ance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> lands in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> This at length he did, and came over with a Fleet, and a con∣siderable Number of Forces. What was the Issue of this Expedition, is very amply described by other Pens, and also not properly my Pro∣vince to relate; wherefore I think it sufficient to my Purpose to say, that the Prince, after some Difficulty at Sea, came into <HI>England,</HI> where ha∣ving many Adherents, the King, many of whose Forces deserted him, resolved to go to <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And K. <HI>James</HI> in <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> whither the Queen with the young Child was gone some Time before. Accordingly he went over, where he was well received by the <HI>French</HI> King, who provided him a Court at St. <HI>Ger∣mains.</HI> In the mean while the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> and was saluted there by the Great Ones as the Deliverer of <HI>England.</HI> The Lord Mayor of the said City, with the Aldermen, and the Sheriffs, having congratulated him, the Prince sent for some of the Members of former Parliaments to come to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince advises with Members of for∣mer Parlia∣ments how to pursue the Ends of his Declara∣tion. For which he receives their Thanks.</NOTE> and he signified to them, <HI>That he had de∣sired them to meet to advise him in the best Manner how to pursue the Ends of his Declaration in calling a free Parliament, for the Preserva∣tion of the Protestant Religion, the restoring of the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, and settling the same, that they might not be in Danger of being again subverted.</HI></P>
<P>In answer to this, Thanks were given to the Prince for his Care and Pains in Defence of the People, their Religion and Laws. And all Things took a favourable Turn for him.</P>
<P>In <HI>Holland</HI> a good while before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sly Paper published in <HI>Holland</HI></NOTE> a Paper was given forth in Print cal∣led, <HI>A Copy of a Letter written by a</HI> Quaker <HI>at</HI> London, <HI>to his Friend at</HI> Rotterdam. In which forged Letter were mentioned several Things that were not altogether untrue, and the Prince's going over to <HI>England,</HI> was also in a Manner predicted. Who was the Author of the said Let∣ter, I could never learn, but of this I am fully satisfied, that he was no <HI>Quaker;</HI> for it never was their way to ridicule Princes and to character∣ize them with ridiculous Denominations, as in the said Letter we find mentioned, of <HI>James</HI> of <HI>Great Britain, Mary</HI> of <HI>Modena, Willam</HI> of <HI>O∣range,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>England his Wife.</HI> This was no more the Language of <HI>Quakers,</HI> than the following Expressions that are found in this Letter. <HI>The Spirit hath inspired me to tell thee. I should not be able to declare my Opinion, before the Spirit shall have revealed it to me. If the Spirit doth dictate it to thee, go and speak with him.</HI> Dentsch <HI>hath had a Revelation, and the Spirit hath assured him,</HI> &amp;c. This foolish Language betrays it self, and serves for a palpable Evidence, that it never proceeded from the Pen of any of the People called <HI>Quakers.</HI> But perhaps the Author of that Letter knew a Secret of State, whereof (to remain unknown) he would acquaint the World in a ridiculous Way, that under the Cloak of being a <HI>Quaker,</HI> he should best continue undiscover'd, and that by this Device the Letter would spread the more, as indeed it did; for it had a very quick Vent.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE called QUAKERS. The ELEVENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>I Proceed now to the Year 1689,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689</NOTE> in the Beginning of which the Peers of the Realm, &amp;c. offered the Administration of the Govern∣ment to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Administration of the Govern∣ment offered to the Prince of <HI>O∣range.</HI></NOTE> which he accepted of. Not long after he called a <HI>Convention</HI> of the Commons; for a Parliament it could not be named, since in <HI>England,</HI> none but a King has Power to call a Parliament. In the mean while the Prince had caused the Princess his Consort to come over from <HI>Holland</HI> into <HI>England;</HI> and at length the Convention, after many great Debates, came to this Resolution, That the Throne was <HI>vacant;</HI> the Consequence of which was, that the Prince and Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who with his Consort were af∣terward declar∣ed King and Queen, and Crowned.</NOTE> were declared by the Names of <HI>William</HI> the Third, and <HI>Mary</HI> the Second, King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. and according∣ly were afterwards crowned. A large Relation thereof is to be found in several Books. By the way I'll only say, that the Coronation was per∣formed by the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> having refused to act in that Solemnity; at the Performance of which, the King and Queen were asked by the Bishop, <HI>Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the People of this Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>and the Domi∣nions thereto belonging, according to the Statutes in Parliament agreed to, and the Laws and Customs of the same.</HI> To which the King and Queen having answered, <HI>I solemnly promise so to do;</HI> the Bishop asked, <HI>Will you to your Power cause Law and Justice in Mercy to be executed in all your Judgments?</HI> Answer was made, <HI>I will.</HI> The next Question was, <HI>Will you to the utmost of your Power maintain the Law of God, the true Pro∣fession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed Religion established by Law? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of this Realm, and to the Churches committed to their Charge, all such Rights and Pri∣vileges as by Law do or shall appertain to them, or any of them?</HI> To this the King and Queen answered, <HI>All this I promise to do.</HI> After this, they laying each of them their Hands upon the Book of the Gospel, said, <HI>These Things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God.</HI> Under these punctual and nice Questions was <HI>More</HI> hidden than some would think: For the King having answered so as hath been said, could not now free any from paying Tithes to the Clergy, without Violation of his Oath.</P>
<P>Not long after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are also declared King and Queen of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> were thus made King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> they were also in <HI>Scotland</HI> declared King and Queen of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> And somebody in <HI>Holland</HI> denoted the Year of his being made King, in this manner, VVILheLMVs tertIVs angLlae VInDeX. Not long after this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The late King <HI>James</HI> supported by the <HI>French</HI> King driven out of <HI>Ireland</HI> by K. <HI>William.</HI></NOTE> a War was proclaimed against <HI>France,</HI> and the late King <HI>James,</HI> supported by the <HI>French</HI> King, went over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence in Process of Time he was driven away by King <HI>William,</HI> after the bloody Battle near the River <HI>Boyn;</HI> but that not belonging to this History, I won't detain my Reader with a Relation thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="599" REF="003104_0610_0FEFF9333A175E50"/>A King having now mounted the Throne, the Convention was turn∣ed into a Parliament; and then this August Assembly made it their Busness to restrain the For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of Conscience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parliament settle Liberty of Conscience to Protestants Dis∣senters by Law</NOTE> and an Act passed for exempting Protestant Dissenters from the <HI>Penal Laws</HI> by which some Dissenters, and especially the <HI>Quakers,</HI> had suffered and been persecuted many Years. Yet Care was taken to keep that Law in Force, by which Papists were excluded from Sitting in Parliament. And those Penal Laws, of which Mention hath been made heretofore in due Place, were now restrained, except the Test-Act, properly required for serv∣ing in high Offices, and to keep out the Papists. The aforesaid Act gave also Liberty to Dissenters to keep Religious Meetings, provided the Doors were not lock'd, barr'd, or bolted, during the Time of such Meeting. But none of these Dissenters were freed from paying of Tithes, or other Church-Duties so called, to the Clergy, nor from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ing cited before Bishops Courts. But this Liberty of keeping publick Meetings was not allowed to Papists; for all that would participate of the said Liberty, were required to take the Oath of Allegiance; yet to comply with the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who for Conscience-sake scru∣pled to take any Oath, this Act enjoyned, that they should subscribe the Following Declaration;</P>

And I declare that no Foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Porentate, hath, or ought to have any Power, Jurisdiction, Superiority, Pre-eminence, or Authority, Ecclesiastical or Spiritual, within this Realm.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this, they were obliged to subscribe also another, with Re∣spect to their Orthodoxy, and for excluding Socinianism.</P>

<P>And lest any Papist might make use of this Declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Place of Wor∣ship to be certifi∣ed.</NOTE> there were required sufficient Protestant Witnesses that the Declarer was a Prote∣stant Dissenter. Besides, <Q>No Congregation or Assembly for Religious Worship was permitted or allowed by this Act, until the Place of such Meeting should be certified to the Bishop of the Diocess, or to the Arch-Deacon of that Arch-Deaconry, or to the Justices of the Peace at the General or Quarter-Sessions of the Peace for the County, City, or Place, in which such Meeting should be held, and registred in the said Bishop's or Arch-Deacon's Court respectively, or recorded at the said General or Quarter-Sessions, for which the Register or Clerk should not take greater Fee or Reward than Six-pence.</Q></P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>DEarly beloved <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Epistle of <HI>S. Crisp,</HI> writ worthy the seri∣ous Considerati∣on of all, but par∣ticularly of such as may be con∣cern'd in the Management of the Affairs of the Church</NOTE> gathered out of the World by the eternal Arm and Power of the mighty God, to bear his holy Name in your Generation; my Love and Life in the Fellowship of the universal Spirit salutes you all, and my Prayer to God is, you may be kept stedfast and immoveable in the Grace of God, and in the Com∣munion of his holy Spirit, that ye may bring forth Fruit in Abundance, according to the abundant Mercy and Grace bestowed upon you, to the Glory of God, and to your mutual Joy, Comfort, and Edification.</P>
<P>And that you may so do, let your Eye be kept daily to the Lord, and behold and take Notice of the wondrous Works that he hath wrought in you, and for you, since the Day ye were first quickened by his <HI>immortal Word,</HI> and stirred up to seek after him, and to wait upon him; how good and gracious he hath been to you, in bringing you from the barren Mountains, where your Souls languished for the heavenly Nourishment, where you knew not the Lord, nor one another, but were without a Comforter, or any to sympathize with you in your Mournings: Oh, how hath he pitied your Groanings, and had Compassion on your Sighings, and brought you into Acquaint∣ance with those that were in the like Exercises; and then he taught you to believe on him that was able to help you: And those that were thus taught of the Father, and felt his drawing Cords of Love prevailing upon them; these came to Christ their Saviour, and in him began to feel a Unity one with another, in the Faith you had received in him; whereby you believed he would give you of his Spirit to teach and guide you in the Way of Truth, Righteousness and Peace; and thus was the Foundation of your holy Communion laid, and a lively Hope raised in each particular Soul, that he that had begun this blessed Work would carry it on; and this Hope made you that ye were not ashamed to make a publick Profession of his Name before the World, but cheerfully to take up his Cross, and deny your selves of your for∣mer Pleasures, Friendships, and Delights of this World: This Hope hath been your Support in many sharp Trials, and bitter Combats you have had with the Enemy of your Soul's Peace within, and with the Enemies of God's holy Way and Truth without; and in all your Conflicts you have sound him nigh at Hand, to put forth his Power on your Behalf, as you have depended upon him for his Assistance; and by these Experiences of his Goodness, your Faith hath been strengthned; and by the same <HI>Word of Life</HI> that quickned you, many more have been reached unto, so that you have seen a daily Addi∣tion of Strength in the Particular, and also an Addition to your Num∣ber, to your great Comfort and Encouragement; and many have come to wait upon the Lord among you, and many are daily enquiring the Way to <HI>Zion,</HI> with their Faces thitherward. These Things are worth your Remembrance, and serious Considerations, that you may look up∣on these great Mercies, as Obligations upon your Souls to walk hum∣bly before the Lord, and to be devout and fervent in your Testimony, for that God that hath done thus great Things for you.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Friends,</HI> consider of the great Works that this mighty Arm of the Lord hath brought to pass in the general, as well as in the particu∣lar; how many Contrivances have been framed, and Laws and Decrees made to lay you waste, and to make you cease to be a People, and how
<PB N="602" REF="003104_0613_0FEFF8F5393E53D0"/>have the Wicked rejoiced thereat, (for a Season) crying, <HI>Ah, ha! thus would we have it; they are all now given up to Banishments, to Impri∣sonments, to Spoils and Ruins; now let us see if that invisible Arm they trust in can deliver them.</HI> Oh Friends! how hath your God been your Support in the Midst of all these Exercises? And when he hath pleased, how hath he quieted the sharpest Storms, and turned back the greatest Floods and Torrents of Persecution that ever you met? And how hath he confounded his and your Enemies, and brought Confu∣sion upon the Heads of them that sought your Hurt? Were not these Things wrought by the Power of God? Did your Number, your Poli∣cy, your Interest, or any Thing that might be called your own, contri∣bute any Thing to these your great Preservations and Deliverances? If not, then let God have the Glory, and acknowledge to his Praise, These have been the Lord's Doings, and are marvellous in our Eyes.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> consider how the wicked One hath wrought in a Mystery among your selves, to scatter you, and to lay you waste from being a People as at this Day; how many several Ways hath he tried, raising up Men of perverse Minds, to subvert, and to turn you from the Faith, and from the Simplicity that is in Christ Jesus our Lord, and to separate you from that invisible Power that hath been your Strength, and to separate you one from another, and by subtile Wiles, to lead you into a false Liberty above the Cross of Christ; and sometimes by sowing Seeds of <HI>Heresy</HI> and <HI>Seditions,</HI> endeavouring to corrupt the Minds of whom they could with pernicious Principles; but oh, how have their Designs been frustrated, and the Authors thereof confounded and brought to nought! And how have you been preserved as a Flock under the Hand of a careful Shepherd, even unto this Day, which mi∣nisters great Cause of Thanksgiving unto all the Faithful, who have witnessed the Working of this preserving Power in their own Particulars.</P>
<P>Also, <HI>My Friends,</HI> it is worth your Considerations, to behold how that by this invisible Power, so many faithful Watchmen are raised up upon the Walls of your <HI>Zion,</HI> that in most of your Meetings there be Men and Women, upon whom God hath laid a Concern to be taking Care for the Good of the Whole, and to take the Oversight upon them, to see all Things kept in good and decent Order, and to make due Pro∣vision for the comforting and relieving the Necessities of the Needy and Distressed, that nothing be lacking to make your Way comforta∣ble; and these have not been, nor are brought under this Charge by any Act of yours, but God hath raised up <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers, Elders</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> of his own Election and Choice, and bowed their Spirits to take upon them the Work and Service to which they are appointed, for the Lord's-sake, and for the Body's-sake, which is the Church, to whom it may truly be said, as in <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 28. <HI>Take ye heed to the Flock of God, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers,</HI> &amp;c. And such ought to be hearkned to in the Discharge of their Trust, as those that must give an Account to him that called them, and gifted them for their several Works and Services in the Church.</P>
<P>And by these Ways and Means hath the Lord established among you a heavenly Government, and built as it were a Hedge about you, that ye may be preserved from Generation to Generation, a People fitted for the Glory that is, and shall daily more and more be revealed among and upon the Faithful, who delight in that Power that called them to be Saints, and to bear a Profession for the holy Name of God against the many Names and Ways that Men in their changeable Minds have set up, that the Name of the Lord alone may be exalted.</P>
<P>And, <HI>dear Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> I intreat you, that the Consideration of these great and weighty Things which God hath wrought for you,
<PB N="603" REF="003104_0614_0FEFF93A29299130"/>and among you, may have that deep and weighty Influence upon your Souls, that ye may find your selves engaged to answer the Love and Mercy of God in your Lives and Conversations, and in all you have to do in this World, that ye may shew forth the Honour of God in all Things, that the Light which hath shined in you, may shine forth thro' you unto others, who yet sit in Darkness; that all Men may know by your innocent and harmless Conversations, and by your close keeping to the Lord, that ye are a People who are assisted and help∣ed by a supernatural Power, which governs your Wills, and subjects them to his blessed Will, and that guides and orders your Affections, and sets them upon heavenly and divine Objects, and that gives you Power to deny your own private Interests, where they happen to stand in Competition with the Interest of Truth; for these and these only, will be found the true Disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ, who can deny themselves, take up a Cross daily, and follow him in the Guidance of his regenerating Power, which brings Death upon Self, and crucifies the old Nature, with its Affections and Lusts, and raiseth up a Birth in you, that hath a holy Will, and Desire to serve the Lord, and do his Will in the Earth; and such as these are Instruments in the Hand of God for him to work by, and to do Works of Righteousness, of Justice, of Charity, and all other the Virtues belonging to a <HI>Christian</HI> Life, to the Honour of God, and for the Comfort and Benefit of his Church and People.
And all you, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> upon whom the Lord hath laid a Care for his Honour, and for the Prosperity of the Truth, and gathered you into the good Order of the Gospel, to meet together to manage the Affairs thereof; take Heed that ye have a single Eye to the Lord, to do the Lord's Business in the Leadings of his Spirit, which is but one, and brings all (that are given up to be governed by it) to be of one Mind and Heart, at least in the general Purpose and Service of those Meetings; altho' thro' the Diversity of Exercises, and the several Degrees of Growth among the Brethren, every one may not see or un∣derstand alike in every Matter, at the first propounding of it; yet this makes no Breach of the Unity, nor hinders the Brotherly-kindness, but puts you often upon an Exercise, and an inward travelling to feel the pure peaceable Wisdom that is from above, to open among you, and every one's Ear is open to it, in whomsoever it speaks, and thereby a Sense of Life is given in the Meeting, to which all that are of a simple and tender Mind, join and agree: But if any among you should be con∣trary minded in the Management of some outward Affair, relating to the Truth, this doth not presently break the Unity that ye have in Christ, nor should weaken the brotherly Love, so long as he keeps waiting for an Understanding from God, to be gathered into the same Sense with you, and walks with you according to the Law of Cha∣rity, such a one ought to be born with, and cherished, and the Sup∣plications of your Souls will go up to God for him, that God may re∣veal it to him, if it be his Will, that so no Difference may be in Un∣derstanding, so far as is necessary for the Good of the Church, no more than there is in Matters of Faith and Obedience to God; For, <HI>My Friends,</HI> it is not of absolute Necessity that every Member of the Church should have the same Measure of Understanding in all Things; for then where were the Duty of the Strong bearing with the Weak? Then where were the Brother of low Degree? Where would be any submitting to them that were set over others in the Lord, which all tend to the preserving Unity in the Church, notwithstanding the dif∣ferent Measures, and different Growths of the Members thereof; for as the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets, so are the
<PB N="604" REF="003104_0615_0FEFF8F70523CBC0"/>Spirits of all that are kept in a true Subjection to the Spirit of Life in themselves, kept in the same Subjection to the Sense of Life given by the same Spirit in the Church; and by this Means we come to know the one Master, even Christ, and have no Room for other Masters in the Master of our Obedience to God; and while every one keeps in this true Subjection, the sweet Concord is known, and the Oil is not only upon <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Head, but it reacheth the Skirts of his Garment also; and Things are kept sweet and savoury, and ye love one another from the greatest to the least in Sincerity, and (as the Apostle saith) <HI>without Dissimulation;</HI> and this Love excludes all <HI>Whisperings of evil Things;</HI> all <HI>Back-biting, Tale-bearing, Grudgings,</HI> and <HI>Murmurings;</HI> and keeps Friends Minds clean one towards another, waiting for every Op∣portunity to do each other Good, and to preserve each others Repu∣tation; and their Hearts are comforted at the Sight of one another; and in all their Affairs, both relating to the Church, and to the World, they will be watchful over their own Spirits, and keep in the Lord's Power, over that Nature and Ground in themselves that would be apt to take an Offence, or construe any Word or Action to a worse Sense than the Simplicity thereof, or the Intention of the other concerned will allow of.</P>
<P>And whereas it may often fall out, that among a great many, some may have a different Apprehension of a Matter from the rest of their Brethren, especially in outward or temporal Things, there ought to be a Christian Liberty maintained for such to express their Sense, with Freedom of Mind, or else they will go away burden'd; whereas if they speak their Minds freely, and a friendly and Christian Conference be admitted thereupon, they may be eased, and oftentimes the different Apprehension of such an one comes to be wholly removed, and his Understanding opened, to see as the rest see; for the Danger in Society doth not lie so much in that, that some few may have a differing Ap∣prehension in some Things from the general Sense, as it doth in this; namely, when such that so differ do suffer themselves to be led out of the Bond of Charity, and shall labour to impose their private Sense upon the rest of their Brethren, and to be offended and angry if it be not received, this is the Seed of Sedition and Strife that hath grown up in too too many, to their own Hurt.</P>
<P>And therefore, <HI>my dear Friends,</HI> beware of it, and seek not to drive a Matter on in Fierceness or in Anger, nor to take Offence into your Minds at any Time, because what seems to be clear to you is not pre∣sently received; but let all Things in the Church be propounded with an awful Reverence of him that is the Head and Life of it; who hath said, <HI>Where two or three are met in my Name, I will be in the Midst of them:</HI> And so he is, and may be felt by all who keep in his Spirit; but he that follows his own Spirit, sees nothing as he ought to see it. Therefore let all beware of their own Spirits and natural Tempers, (as they are sometimes called) but let all keep in a gracious Temper, then are ye fit for the Service of the House of God, whose House ye are, as ye keep upon the Foundation that God hath laid; and he will build you up, and teach you how to build up one another in him, and as every Member must feel Life in themselves, and all from one Head; this Life will not hurt it self in any, but be tender of the Life in all; for by this one Life of the WORD ye were begotten, and by it ye are nourished, and made to grow into your several Services in the Church of God; it is no Man's Learning, nor artificial Acquirement<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; it's no Man's Riches nor Greatness in this World; it's no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Elo∣quence and natural Wisdom, that makes him fit for Government in the Church of Christ, unless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with all his Endowments, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>some
<PB N="605" REF="003104_0616_0FEFF93D94D23EF8"/>with the heavenly Salt, and his Spirit subjected, and his Gifts pass thro' the Fire of God's Altar, a Sacrifice to his Praise and Honour, that so Self be crucified and baptized in Death, and the Gifts made use of in the Power of the Resurrection of the Life of Jesus in him; and when this great Work is wrought in a Man, then all his Gifts and Qualifications are sanctified, and they are made use of for the Good of the Body, which is the Church, and are as Ornaments and Jewels, which serves for the Joy and Comfort of all, who are Partakers of the same divine Fellowship of Life in Christ Jesus our Lord; and thus come many to be fitted and furnished to good Words, and to good Works, which are brought forth in their due Seasons, for Edification, and building up the Weak, and for repairing the decayed Places, and also for Defence of them that are feeble, that hurtful Things may not come near them.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>Friends!</HI> great is the Work the Lord hath called you to, and is a fitting you for, who innocently wait upon him; and the Lord hath opened my Heart unto you, and laid it upon me to exhort and be∣seech to have a Care that ye quit your selves as ye ought, in what God requires of ye; and for the more particular expressing what lies before me in the Matter, I shall set down a few particular Observations for your Benefit and Advantage; and my Soul's Desire is, that my La∣bour of Love may have a good Effect in all your Bosoms, that God may be honoured thereby. And, Friends, ye know the chief Business, to which ye are called in your particular Men and Women's Meetings, is under these two Heads, Justice and Charity; the first, to see that every one hath Right done him, and the other to take Care there be nothing lacking to the Comfort of the Poor that are made Partakers of the same Faith with you.</P>
<P>And when ye meet about these Things, keep the Lord in your Eye, and wait to feel his Power to guide and direct you, to speak and behave your selves in the Church of God, as becomes the peaceable Gospel: And beware of all Brittleness of Spirit, and sharp Reflection upon each others Words; for that will kindle up Heats, and create a false Fire, and when one takes a Liberty of a sharp Word spoken out of the true Fear and Tenderness, it oftentimes becomes a Temptation to another; and if he hath not a great Care, it will draw him out also, and then the first is guilty of two Evils, first being led into a Temptation, and then secondly, he becomes a Tempter to others; therefore all had need be upon their Watch, neither to tempt, nor be tempted; and let none think it a sufficient Excuse for them that they were provoked; for we are as answerable to God for every evil Word spoken upon Pro∣vocation, as without Provocation; for, for that End hath the Lord re∣vealed his Power to us, to keep and preserve us in his Fear and Counsel in the Time of our Provocations; and therefore if any Man thro' Want of Watchfulness, should be overtaken with Heat or Passion, <HI>a soft Answer appeaseth Wrath,</HI> saith the wife Man; and therefore such a Time is fittest for a soft Answer, lest the Enemy prevail on any to their Hurt, and to the Grief and Trouble of their Brethren; for it is the proper Duty of Watchmen and Overseers, to spare the Flock, that is, let nothing come nigh them that will hurt them, and wound and grieve them: Nay, the good Apostle was so careful over the Flock of Believers, that if there were any doubtful Matters to be disputed of, he would not have them that were weak in the Faith at such Disputes, much less ought they that are weak to see those that are strong descend from their Strength, and go into the Weakness where they are not able to bear, for that is certainly the weak that cannot bear; those that really live in the Strength and Power, they can bear even Burdens for</P>
<P><PB N="606" REF="003104_0617_0FEFF8F9440E8748"/>
them that cannot bear their own. The Apostle in the Place before∣mentioned, when he sent for the Elders of <HI>Ephesus</HI> to <HI>Miletus,</HI> and lest a Charge with them, before he said, <HI>Take heed to the Flock of God;</HI> he said, <HI>Take ye heed to your selves:</HI> And indeed we are none of us like to discharge our selves well towards others, but by taking heed to our selves, to be kept in that sober innocent Frame of Spirit, which the Truth calls for.</P>
<P>In the next Place, <HI>My dear Friends,</HI> when ye are called upon in Point of Justice, to give a Sentence of Right between Friend and Friend, take heed that neither Party get Possession of your Spirit aforehand, by any Way or Means whatsoever, or obtain any Word or Sentence from you in the Absence of the other Party, he not being yet heard: There is nothing more comely among Men than impartial Judgment; Judgment is a Seat, where neither Interest nor Affection, nor former Kindnesses may come; we may make no Difference of the Worthiness or Unworthiness of Persons in Judgment, as we may in Charity; but in Judgment, if a good Man, being mistaken, hath a bad Cause, or a bad Man a good Cause, according to his Cause must he have Sentence: It was a good Saying, <HI>He that judgeth among Men, judgeth for the Lord, and he will repay it.</HI> Therefore let all be done as unto the Lord, and as ye are willing to answer it in his Presence; and altho' some may for a Time be discontent thereat, yet in Time God shall clear up your In∣nocency as the Sun at Noon-day; and they that kick at sound Judg∣ment, will find but hard Work of it, they do but kick against that which will prick them; and however such, thro' their Wilfulness, and their abounding in their own Sense may hurt themselves, yet you will be preserved, and enjoy your Peace and Satisfaction in the Dis∣charge of your Consciences in the Sight of God.</P>
<P>And as concerning practical <HI>Charity,</HI> ye know it's supported by Li∣berality, and where Liberality ceaseth, Charity waxeth cold, yea, so far ceaseth; where there is no Contribution, there is no Distribution; where the one is sparing, the other is sparing; and therefore let every one nourish Charity in the Root, that is, keep a liberal Mind, a Heart that looks upon the Substance that is given him, as really bestowed up∣on him for the Support of Charity, as for the Support of his own Body; and where People are of this Mind, they will have a Care of keeping back any of God's Part, for he hath in all Ages in a most sin∣gular Manner, espoused the Cause of the Poor, the Widow, and Father∣less, and hath often signified by his Prophets and Ministers, a special Charge upon rich Men that had this World's Goods, that they should look to it that they were faithful Stewards of what they possess'd, and that they might be found in good Works, and might not suffer their Hearts so to cleave to uncertain Riches, as to neglect the Service God had given them the Things of this Life for, either to give them up when called for in a Testimony of his worthy Name, or to communi∣cate of them to those that were in Necessity.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the Necessities of the Poor, there is great Need of Wisdom, when ye meet together about that Affair; for as I said before, tho' the Worthiness or Unworthiness of Persons is not to be considered in Judgment, yet in this it is; and you will find some that God hath made poor, and some that have made themselves poor, and some that others have made poor, which must all have their several Considerations, in which you ought to labour to be unanimous, and not one to be taken up with an Affection to one Person more than ano∣ther, but every one to love every one in the universal Spirit, and then to deal out that Love in the outward Manifestations thereof, accord∣ing to the Measure that the Lord in his Wisdom working in you shall measure forth to them.</P>
<P><PB N="607" REF="003104_0618_0FEFF94097B8F3C8"/>And as to those who by <HI>Sickness, Lameness, Age,</HI> or other Impo∣tency, are brought into Poverty by the Hand of Providence; these are your peculiar Care, and Objects pointed out to you, to bestow your Charity upon, for by them the Lord calls for it; for as the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness of it, he hath by his sovereign Power com∣manded in every Dispensation, that a Part of what we enjoy from him, should be thus employed: The <HI>Israelites</HI> were not to reap the Corners of their Fields, nor to gather the Gleanings of the Corn nor Vintage, it was for the Poor; and in the Time of the Gospel they were to lay apart, on the <HI>First-day</HI> of the Week, a Part of what God had blessed them with, for the Relief of those that were in Necessity; nay, they did not confine themselves in their Charity to their own Meetings, but had an universal Eye thro' the whole Church of Christ, and upon ex∣traordinary Occasions, sent their Benevolence to relieve the Saints at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in a Time of Need; and all that keep in the Guidance of the same universal Spirit, will make it their Business to be found in the same Practice of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>good Works; To do Good, and to com∣municate, forget not,</HI> saith the Apostle: So they that forget not this <HI>Christian Duty,</HI> will find out the Poors Part in the Corners and Glean∣ings of the Profits of their Trades and Merchandizings, as well as the old <HI>Israelite</HI> did the Corners and Gleanings of his Field; and in the Distribution of it, will have a Regard to comfort the Bowels of such, who are by the divine Providence of God put out of a Capacity of en∣joying those outward Comforts of Health, and Strength, and Plenty, which others do enjoy; for while they are Partakers of the same Faith, and walk in the Way of Righteousness with you, submitting them∣selves patiently to the Dispensation of God's Providence towards them, they are of your Houshold, and under your Care, both to visit, and to relieve as Members of one Body, of which Christ Jesus is Head; and he that giveth to such Poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay it.</P>
<P>But there is another Sort of Poor, who make themselves poor thro' their Sloth and Carelessness, and sometimes by their Wilfulness, be∣ing heady and high-minded, and taking Things in Hand that are more than they can manage, and make a Flourish for a Season, and then thro' their own Neglects, are plunged down into great Poverty: These are a Sort the Primitive Churches began to be troubled withal in the early Days of the Gospel; for the Apostle took Notice of some that would not work at all, and sharply reproved them, and said, <HI>They that would not work should not eat;</HI> and these are commonly a Sort of Busy-bodies, and Meddlers with others Matters, while they neglect their own, and run into a worse Way than the Unbelievers, while they profess to be Believers, yet do not take a due Care for those of their own Houshold.</P>
<P>The Charity that is proper to such, is to give them Admonition and Reproof, and to convince them of their Sloth and Negligence; and if they submit to your Reproof, and are willing to amend, then Care ought to be taken to help them into a Way and Means to support themselves; and sometimes by a little Help in this Kind, some have been reclaimed from the Snares of their Soul's Enemy: But if they will not receive your wholsome Counsel and Admonitions, but kick against it, either in their Words or Actions, Friends will be clear of such in the Sight of God; for it is unreasonable to feed them that will not be ruled by you; they break the Obligation of Society by their disorderly walking; for our Communion doth not stand only in fre∣quenting Meetings, and hearing Truth preached, but in answering the blessed Principle of Truth, in Life and Conversation, and therein both the Rich and the Poor have Fellowship one with another.</P>
<P><PB N="608" REF="003104_0619_0FEFF8FBA473DD08"/>There is another Sort that are made poor by the Oppressions and Cru∣elties of others. These oppressed Poor cry loud in the Ears of the Almighty, and he will in his own Time avenge their Cause; but in the mean Time there is a Tenderness to be extended to them, not knowing how soon it may be our Turn, and if there be Need of Coun∣sel and Advice, or if any Applications can be made to any that are able to deliver them from the Oppressors, in such Cases let all that are capable be ready and willing to advise, relieve and help the Distressed; and this is an acceptable Work of Charity, and a great Comfort to such in their sharp Afflictions, and their Souls will bless the Instru∣ments of their Ease and Comfort.</P>
<P>And, <HI>My dear Friends,</HI> as God hath honoured you with so high and holy a Calling, to be his Servants and Workmen in this his great and notable Day, and to work together in his Power, in setting forth his Praise and Glory in the Earth, and gathering together in one the scat∣tered Seed in this and other Nations: Oh, let the Dignity of your Call∣ing provoke and encourage you to be diligent Attenders upon his Work and Service you are called to, and let not your Concerns in the World draw you from observing the Times and Seasons appointed to meet together; but you that are Elder, set a good Example to the younger Sort, by a due Observation of the Hour appointed, that they that come first one Time, may not by their long Staying for others be discou∣raged, so as perhaps they may be last another Time; but when the Time is come, leave your Business for the Lord's Work, and he will take Care your Business shall not suffer, but will add a Blessing upon it, which will do more for you than the Time can do that may be saved out of his Service.</P>
<P>And when ye have to do with perverse, and froward or disorderly Persons, whom ye have Occasion to reprove and to rebuke for the Truth's-sake, and you find them stout and high, and reflecting upon ye, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is a Time for the Lamb's Meekness to shine forth, and for you to feel your Authority in the Name of Christ to deal with such an one, and to wait for the pure and peaceable Wisdom from above, to bring down and confound the earthly Wisdom. And in this Frame of Mind you labour together to pull the entangled Sheep out of the Thicket, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o restore that which is gone astray, to the Fold again, if you can; but if you cannot, yet you save your selves from the Guilt of his Blood; and if such do perish, his Blood will be on his own Head: But on the other hand, if ye suffer their perverse Spirits to enter, and their Provocations to have a Place in you, so as to kindle your Spirits into a Heat and Passion, then you get a Hurt, and are uncapa∣ble to do them any Good; but Words will break out that will need Repentance, and the Wicked will be stiffened and strengthened there∣by, and you miss the Service that you did really intend. Therefore, dearly Beloved, keep upon your Watch, keep on your Spiritual Ar∣mour; keep your Feet shod with the Preparation of the Gospel of Peace, and the God of Peace will be with you, and crown your En∣deavours with good Success, to your Joy and Comfort, and will bring up his Power over your Adversaries and Opposers more and more, to which many shall bow and bend in your Sight; and will bring Shame and Confusion upon the Rebellious, who harden their Hearts, and stiffen their Necks against the Lord, and his Christ, and Kingdom, which he will exalt in the Earth, notwithstanding all that Satan, and all his evil Instruments can do to hinder the Growth and Progress of his blessed Truth; for of the Increase of the Government, and of the Peace of the Kingdom of Christ there shall be no End.</P>
<P><PB N="609" REF="003104_0620_0FEFF942379EA9A8"/>And now, <HI>Friends,</HI> I having cleared my Conscience of what lay upon me for some Time, to write unto you by Way of Remembrance, and as the Exhortation of my Life unto you, I remain travelling in Spirit for the Welfare of <HI>Zion:</HI> And altho' the outward Man decays, yet in the inward Man I am comforted, in beholding daily the great Things that our God hath done, and is still doing for those that have their sole Dependance upon him.

</LETTER>
<P>Passing now by other Matters of this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691</NOTE> we step to the next, be∣ing that of 1691,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Sickness, Death &amp; Cha∣racter of <HI>G. Fox.</HI></NOTE> about the Beginning of which, <HI>G. Fox</HI> departed this Life, who even in the last Period thereof writ much, and continued la∣borious without fainting. The last Epistle I find of his, was to his Friends and Brethren in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who because of the Revolution and Troubles there, suffered much, chiefly as I think by the Papists; and therefore in the said Epistle he exhorted his Friends to Stedfastness: This was in the Month called <HI>January;</HI> and the next Day, being the first of the Week, and the 11th of the said Month, he went to the Meeting at <HI>Grace-church-street,</HI> where he preached very effectually, treat∣ing of many Things with great Power and Clearness; and concluded with a Prayer. After which, the Meeting ending, he went to <HI>Henry Gouldney</HI>'s in <HI>White-Hart-Court,</HI> near the Meeting-house, where he said to some that came with him, <HI>He thought he felt the Cold strike to his Heart, as he came out of the Meeting.</HI> Yet added, <HI>I am glad I was here. Now I am clear, I am fully clear.</HI> When those Friends that were with him, were withdrawn, he lay down in his Clothes upon a Bed, but soon rose again; yet after a little Time he lay down again, com∣plaining still of Cold; and his Strength decaying, he not long after undress'd, and went to Bed; where he lay in much Contentment and Re∣signation, continuing very sensible to the last. His Distemper increasing, and perhaps perceiving that his End was at Hand, he recommended the spreading of Books (containing the Doctrine of Truth) to some of his Friends, that came to him after having been sent for. And to some others who came to visit him in his Illness, he said, <HI>All is well, the Seed of God reigns over all, and over Death it self. And tho'</HI> (continued he) <HI>I am weak in Body, yet the Power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over all disorderly Spirits.</HI> He used often, even in his Preaching, when he spoke of Christ, to call him <HI>the Seed;</HI> wherefore those that were with him, very well knew what he meant when he spoke of the Seed. Thus he lay in a heavenly Frame of Mind, and his Spirit being wholly exercised towards the Lord, he grew weaker and weaker in Body, until on the third Day of the Week, and of his Sickness also, he piously de∣parted this Life. About four or five Hours before, being asked, <HI>How he
<PB N="610" REF="003104_0621_0FEFF8FE0050B040"/>did,</HI> he answered, <HI>Don't heed, The Power of the Lord is above all Sick∣ness and Death; the Seed reigns, blessed be the Lord.</HI> And thus triumph∣ing over Death, he departed from hence in Peace, and slept sweetly on the 13th of the Month anciently called <HI>January,</HI> (for being as a Door or Entrance into the New Year) about ten a-clock at Night, in the 67th Year of his Age. His Body was buried near <HI>Bunhill-Fields</HI> on the 16th of the said Month, the Corps being accompanied by great Numbers of his Friends, and of other People also: For tho' he had had many Ene∣mies, yet he had made himself also beloved of many. He was tall of Stature, and pretty big-bodied, yet very moderate in Meat and Drink; neither did he yield much to Sleep. He was a Man of a deep Under∣standing, and of a discerning Spirit; and tho' his Words were not al∣ways link'd together by a neat Grammatical Connexion, and that his Speech sometimes seemed abrupt, as with a kind of Gap; yet he ex∣press'd himself intelligently, and what was wanting in human Wisdom, was abundantly supplied with Heavenly Knowledge. He was of a quick Apprehension; and tho' his Wit was not polished by humane Arts, yet he was ingenious; and in his Prayers (which generally were not very long, tho' powerful) appeared a decent Gravity, mix'd with an awful Reverence, to Admiration. His Qualities are at large set forth by <HI>Thomas Elwood,</HI> an eminent Author, who having much conversed with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character by <HI>T. Elwood.</HI></NOTE> gave the following Character of him. <Q>He was indeed an heavenly-minded Man, zealous for the Name of the Lord, and pre∣fer'd the Honour of God before all Things. He was valiant for the Truth, bold in asserting it, patient in suffering for it, unwearied in labouring in it, steady in his Testimony to it, immoveable as a Rock. Deep he was in divine Knowledge, clear in opening heavenly Myste∣ries, plain and powerful in Preaching, fervent in Prayer. He was richly endued with Heavenly Wisdom, quick in discerning, sound in Judgment; able and ready in giving, discreet in keeping Counsel; a Lover of Righteousness, an Encourager of Virtue, Justice, Tempe∣rance, Meekness, Purity, Chastity, Modesty, Humility, Charity, and Self-denial in all, both by Word and Example. Graceful he was in Countenance, manly in Personage, grave in Gesture, courteous in Conversation, weighty in Communication, instructive in Discourse, free from Affectation in Speech and Carriage. A severe Reprover of hard and obstinate Sinners, a mild and gentle Admonisher of such as were tender and sensible of their Failings. Not apt to resent Per∣sonal Wrongs, easie to forgive Injuries; but zealously earnest, where the Honour of God, the Prosperity of Truth, the Peace of the Church were concerned. Very tender, compassionate, and pitiful he was to all that were under any sort of Affliction; full of brotherly Love, full of fatherly Care: For indeed the Care of the Churches of Christ was daily upon him, the Prosperity and Peace whereof he studiously sought.</Q> Yet more is said of him to his Praise, both by the said <HI>Tho. Elwood</HI> and others; but I will not detain my Reader any longer therewith. His Wife, about six Months before his Death, came to him at <HI>London,</HI> and being glad of his Health, which then was bet∣ter than some Time before, she, after some Stay in the said City, re∣turned Home well satisfied, leaving him at <HI>London,</HI> where his general Service to the Church seem'd to be then most requisite. After his De∣cease an Epistle was found, which was writ with his own Hand, and left sealed up with this Superscription, <HI>Not to be opened before the Time.</HI> What this signified, seemed to be a Riddle; but he being now deceas'd, it was judged to be the Time to open this Letter, which was directed to his Friends, and was as followeth;</P>

<PB N="611" REF="003104_0622_0FEFF944F8063D48"/>
<HEAD>For the Yearly and Second-Days-Meeting in <HI>London,</HI> and to all the Children of God in all Places in the World. By and from <HI>G. F.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">This for all the Children of God every where, that are led by his Spi∣rit, and do walk in his Light, in which they have Life and Unity, and Fellowship with the Father, and the Son, and one with another.</HEAD>
<P>KEep all your Meetings in the Name of the Lord Jesus that be ga∣thered in his Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Epistle of <HI>G. Fox</HI> left sealed up.</NOTE> by his Light, Grace, Truth, Power and Spirit; by which you will feel his blessed and refreshing Presence among you, and in you, to your Comfort and God's Glory.</P>
<P>And now all Friends, all your Meetings, both Mens and Womens, Month∣ly and Quarterly, and Yearly, &amp;c. were set up by the Power, and Spirit, and Wisdom of God; and in them you do know that you have felt both his Power, and Spirit, and Wisdom, and blessed refreshing Presence among you, and in you, to his Praise and Glory, and your Comfort: So that you have been a <HI>City set on a Hill, that cannot be hid.</HI></P>
<P>And altho' many loose and unruly Spirits have risen betimes to op∣pose you and them, both in Print and otherways; but you have seen how they have come to nought; and the Lord hath blasted them, and brought their Deeds to Light, and made them manifest to be the Trees without Fruit, and Wells without Water, and wandering Stars from the Firmament of God's Power, and the raging Waves of the Sea, casting up their Mire and Dirt: And many of them are like the Dog turned to his old Vomit, and the Sow that was washed, turned again to the Mire. And this hath been the Condition of many, God knoweth, and his People.</P>
<P>And therefore all stand stedfast in Christ Jesus your Head, in whom you are all one, Male and Female, and know his Government, and of the Encrease of his Government and Peace there shall be no End; but there will be an End of the Devil's, and of all them that be out of Christ, and do oppose it and him, whose Judgment doth not linger, and their Dam∣nation doth not slumber: And therefore in God and Christ's Light, Life, Spirit and Power live and walk, that is over all (and the Seed of it) in Love and in Innocency, and Simplicity; and in Righteousness and Holi∣ness dwell, and in his Power and Holy Ghost, in which God's Kingdom doth stand. All Children of New and Heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that is from above, and is free, with all her Holy, Spiritual Children, To her keep your Eyes.</P>
<P>And as for this Spirit of Rebellion and Opposition, that hath risen for∣merly and lately, it is out of the Kingdom of God and heavenly <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and is for Judgment and Condemnation, with all its Books, Words and Works. And therefore Friends are to live and walk in the Power and Spirit of God, that is over it, and in the Seed, that will bruise and break it to pieces: In which Seed you have Joy and Peace with God, and Power and Authority to judge it; and your Unity is in the Power and Spirit of God, that doth judge it; and all God's Witnesses in his Taber∣nacle go out against it, and always have and will.</P>
<P>And let no Man live to Self, but to the Lord, as they will die in him; and seek the Peace of the Church of Christ, and the Peace of all Men in him: for <HI>Blessed are the Peace-makers.</HI> And dwell in the pure, peace∣able, heavenly Wisdom of God, that is gentle, and easie to be entreated, that is full of Mercy; all striving to be of one Mind, Heart, Soul and Judgment in Christ, having his Mind and Spirit dwelling in you, build∣ing up one another in the Love of God, which doth edifie the Body of Christ, his Church, who is the Holy Head thereof. So Glory to God thro' Christ, in this Age, and all other Ages, who is the Rock and Foundation,
<PB N="612" REF="003104_0623_0FEFF9005315F4B0"/>and the <HI>Emanuel,</HI> God with us, <HI>Amen,</HI> over all, the Beginning, and the Ending; in him live and walk, in whom you have Life Eternal, in whom you will feel me, and I you.</P>
<P>All Children of New <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that descends from above, the Holy City, which the Lord and the Lamb is the Light thereof, and is the Tem∣ple; in it they are born again of the Spirit: So <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that is above is the Mother of them that are born of the Spirit. And so they that come, and are come to heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> are them that receive Christ; and be giveth them Power to become the Sons of God, and are born again of the Spirit: So <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that is their Mother. And such do come to Heavenly Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> and the innumerable Company of Angels, and to the Spirits of just Men made perfect; and are come to the Church of the Living God written in Heaven, and have the Name of God, and the City of God written upon them: So here is a New Mother, that bringeth forth a heavenly and a Spiritual Generation.</P>
<P>There is no Schism, nor Divison, nor Contention, nor Strife, in Hea∣venly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> nor in the Body of Christ, which is made up of Living Stones, a Spiritual House. And Christ is not divided, for in him there is Peace. Christ saith, <HI>in me you have Peace.</HI> And he is from above, and not of this World; but in the World below, in the Spirit of it there is Trouble: Therefore keep in Christ, and walk in him, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>G. F.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was the Mother of all true Christians before the Apo∣stacy; and since the outward Christians are broken into many Sects, and they have gotten many Mothers: But all they that are come out of the Apo∣stacy by the Power and Spirit of Christ, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that is above, is their Mother, (and none below her;) who doth nourish all her Spiritual Children.</P>

<P>It was in this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.

He had been premunired for refusing to take the Oath; and his Goods, whereof the Moveables were rated at two hun∣dred forty-four Pounds, and the real Estate counted worth sixty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> were confiscated.

<P>Now Time calls me to say something of the Apostacy of <HI>George Keith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A short Account of the Apostacy of <HI>G. Keith.</HI></NOTE> who being in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> made a great Bustle there. He was a witty Person, and esteemed very learned; and at the University ob∣tained the Degree of Master of Arts. He often also gave Proofs of an high soaring Knowledge, and was very ready to shew from Philosophy the Reasons and Causes of many Things in the Creation; but the Doc∣trine of <HI>Francis Mercurius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who imbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es the Notion of Transmigration from <HI>Van Hel∣mont.</HI></NOTE> Baron of <HI>Helmont,</HI> concerning the Trans∣migration of Souls, became so Palatable to him, that he not only in some Manner approved it, but also was believed to be concerned in the Book containing two hundred Queries about that Matter, great Part of which, as I have been informed, he acknowledged to have been put in Writing by himself, tho' it appeared in Publick without the Author's Name. But this Notion meeting with no Acceptance among the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> his Love to them began to abate, and his Discontent increased, because two Persons, who opposed him, had, (as he said) used some un∣warrantable
<PB N="613" REF="003104_0624_0FEFF948735B8D70"/>Expressions, and were not so sharply reproved, as he, who was of a fiery Temper, desired. He accused them, that they had said, <HI>That the Light within was sufficient to Salvation, without any Thing else.</HI> From whence he endeavour'd to prove, that they excluded the Man Jesus Christ, as not necessary to Salvation; but they denied this to be their Doctrine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Differs with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Brethren in Pennsylvania.</NOTE> He afterwards said of <HI>William Stockdel,</HI> one of those two Persons at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania, That he had charged him</HI> G. K. <HI>to have preached two Christs, because he preached Faith in Christ within, and in Christ without us.</HI> Now tho' <HI>Stockdel</HI> would not allow this to be true, and some of the Hearers also denied it, tho' asserted by two others of his Party, yet <HI>G. Keith</HI> blew the Fire of this Quarrel, and so got some Adherents. He also charged the Deputy-Governor <HI>Tho∣mas Lloyd,</HI> to have said, <HI>That Faith in Christ without us, as he died for our Sins, and rose again, was not necessary to our Salvation.</HI> But others said, that the Words were not so, and that the Matter was not fairly stated; since the Question was not, <HI>Whether Faith in Christ without us, as he died for our Sins, and rose again, was not necessary to our Salvation:</HI> But, <HI>Whether that Faith were indispensably necessary to all Mankind, and that none could be saved without it, tho' they had not the Means, Oppor∣tunity or Capacity to know or receive it.</HI> Which being asserted, it was thought that such a Position did not only exclude from Salvation whole Nations, but also Infants, and deaf and dumb Persons. Better had it been that such Questions never had been started; for a passionate main∣taining of a different Position, often breeds Strife and Contention. But <HI>G.Keith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Separates from their Society.</NOTE> with some others, having now separated themselves from the mutual Society, he said, <HI>His Dissatisfaction was only with some unsound</HI> Quakers <HI>in</HI> America, <HI>but he was in Unity with all faithful Friends in</HI> England. And since now he began to behave himself very disrespect∣fully, and was on that Account sharply reproved by the aforesaid <HI>Tho. Lloyd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is reproachful to the Deputy-Governour, and slanders the Magistrates in Print.</NOTE> he did not stick to speak to him in a reproachful way, charging him with <HI>Impudence,</HI> and saying, <HI>That he was unfit to be a Governor, and that his Name should stink,</HI> &amp;c. Now because some Members of the Council did not expect to be better treated by him, since he had called one of the Magistrates <HI>impudent Rascal,</HI> this was much resented, and the more, because <HI>G. Keith</HI> having drawn in a Printer, published a Paper, wherein he not only scandalously slandered the Diligence of the Magistrates in restraining of Robbers, but also the Judicial Proceedings against Murtherers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joyned by the <HI>Mennonites.</HI></NOTE> And now seeing several <HI>Mennonites</HI> of the County of <HI>Meurs</HI> lived also in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> it was not much to be wonder'd, that they who count it unlawful for a Christian to bear the Sword of Magistracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is fixed for slandering the Magistrates, but the Fine not ex∣acted.</NOTE> did stick to him; and to get Adherents seemed the main Thing he aimed at; for he himself was not train'd up under such a No∣tion, but in the Doctrine of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Consequence of this Case was, that <HI>Keith,</HI> and one <HI>Thomas Bud,</HI> who (with him) had been Compiler of the aforesaid Paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And some time after comes again into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and com∣plains to the Church at <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> were fined for it; but yet the Government was so moderate, that the Fine was never exacted: And for all that, G. <HI>Keith</HI> did not stick to make a great Clamour of his Suf∣ferings; and about two Years after, he came into <HI>England,</HI> to make his Complaint to the Church at <HI>London.</HI></P>

being under great Pain, he was visited by <HI>G.

<P>So that the Light and Life of the Son of God <HI>within,</HI> truly obeyed and followed, as being the Principle of the second or new Covenant, as Christ the Light is confessed to be, (even as he is the Seed or Word of Faith in <HI>all Men</HI>) this does not leave Men or Women (who believe in the Light) under the first Covenant, nor as Sons of the Bond-woman, as the literal <HI>Jews</HI> were, (when gone from the Spirit of God, and his Christ in them) but it naturally leads them into the new Covenant, into the new and living Way, and to the Adoption of Sons, to be Children and Sons of the Free-woman, of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from above.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that we ought not to lay aside, nor any way to undervalue (but highly to esteem) true Preaching and the Holy Scriptures, and the sincere Belief and Faith of Christ, as he died for our Sins, and rose again for our Justification, together with Christ's Inward and Spiritual Appearance, and Work of Grace in the Soul, livingly to open the Mystery of his Death, and perfectly to effect both our Reconciliation, Sanctification, and Justification; and where-ever Christ qualifies and calls any to Preach and Demonstrate the Mystery of his Coming, Death, and Resurrection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> even among the Gentiles, Christ ought accordingly to be both preach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, believed and received.</P>
<P>Yet supposing there have been, or are such pious and consciencious Gen∣tiles, in whom Christ was and is as the Seed or Principle of the second or new Covenant, the Light, the Word of Faith, (as is granted) and that such live uprightly and faithfully to that Light they have, or to what is made known of God in them, and who therefore in that State cannot perish, but shall be saved, as is also confessed; and supposing these have not the outward Advantage of Preaching, Scripture, or thence the Know∣ledge of Christ's outward coming, being outwardly crucified and risen from the Dead, can such, thus considered, be justly excluded Christianity, or the Covenant of Grace, (as to the Vertue, Life, and Nature thereof) or truly deemed no Christians, or void of any Christian Faith in the Life and Power of the Son of God within, or be only Sons of the first Covenant, and Bond-woman, like the literal out-side <HI>Jews?</HI> Or must all be excluded any true Knowledge or Faith of Christ within them, unless they have the Know∣ledge of Christ as without them? No sure, for that would imply Insuffici∣ency in Christ and his Light, <HI>as within</HI> them, and to frustrate God's good End and Promise of Christ, and his free and universal Love and Grace to Mankind, in sending his Son. We charitably believe the contrary, that they must have some true Faith and Interest in Christ and his Medi∣ation, because of God's free Love in Christ to all Mankind, and Christ's dying for all Men<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor v. 14, 15</NOTE>, and being given for a Light to the Gentiles, and for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Isa xlix 6 Luke ii. 32.

There are Christians sincere and perfect in Kind or Nature, in Life and Substance, tho' not in Knowledge and Un∣derstanding. A Man or Woman having the Life and Fruits of true Christianity, the Fruits of the Spirit of Christ in them that can talk little thereof, or of Creeds, Points or Articles of Faith, yea many that cannot read Letters, yet may be true Christians in Spirit and Life; and some could die for Christ, that could not dispute for him; and even Infants that die in Innocency are not excluded the Grace of God, or Salvation in and by Christ Jesus, the Image and Nature of the Son of God being in some Measure in them, and they under God's Care and special Providence. <HI>See</HI> Mat. xviii. 2, 10.</P>
<P>And tho' we had the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and a Belief of Christ crucified and risen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we never truly knew the Mystery thereof, until we were turned to the Light of his Grace and Spi∣rit within us; we knew not what it was to be reconciled by his Death, and saved by his Life, or what it was to know the Fellowship of his Suf∣ferings, the Power of his Resurrection, or to be made conformable unto his Death; we knew not, until he opened our Eyes, and turned our Minds from Darkness unto his own divine Light and Life within us.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, we do sincerely and greatly esteem and value the holy Scriptures, Preaching and Teaching of faithful, divinely inspired, gifted and qualified Persons and Ministers of Jesus Christ, as being great out∣ward Helps, and instrumental in his Hand, and by his Spirit for Conver∣sion, where God is pleased to afford those outward Helps and Means, as that we neither do nor may oppose the Sufficiency of the Light or Spirit of Christ <HI>within</HI> to such <HI>outward</HI> Helps or Means, so as to reject, disesteem, or undervalue them; for they all proceed from the same Light and Spirit, and tend to turn Mens Minds thereunto, and all center therein.</P>
<P>Nor can the holy Scriptures or true Preaching without, be justly set in Oppostion to the Light or Spirit of God or Christ within, for his faithful Messengers are Ministers thereof, being sent to turn People to the same Light and Spirit in them. <HI>Acts xxvi. 18.

<P>'Tis certain, that great is the Mystery of Godliness in it self, in its own Being and Excellency, namely, That God should be, and was manifest in the Flesh justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>d unto the Gentiles, be∣lieved on in the World, and <HI>received</HI> up into Glory.</P>
<P>And 'tis a great and precious Mystery of Godliness and Christianity also, that Christ should be spiritually and effectually in Mens Hearts, to save and deliver them from Sin, Satan, and Bondage of Corruption, Christ being thus revealed in true Believers, and dwelling in their Hearts by Faith, Christ <HI>within</HI> the Hope of Glory, our Light and Life, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, <HI>1 Cor. i. 30.</HI> And therefore this Mystery of Godliness, both as in its own Being and Glory, and also as in Men (in many hid, and in some revealed) hath been and must be testified, preached and believed, where God is pleased to give Commission (and prepare Peoples Hearts for the same) and not in Man's Will.</P>

<P>That this blessed heavenly Man, this Son of Man, who hath so deeply suffered and endured so many great Indignities and Persecutions from his Adversaries, (both to himself, and his Members and Brethren) should at last, even in the last and great Day, signally and manifestly appear in Glory and Triumph, attended with all his glorious heavenly Host and Re∣tinue, before all Nations, before all his Enemies, and those that have denied him; this will be to their great Terror and Amazement, that this most glorious heavenly Man, and his Brethren that have been so much con∣temned and set at nought, should be thus exalted over their Enemies and Persecutors, in Glory and Triumph, is a righteous Thing with God; and that they that suffer with him, should appear with him in Glory and Dignity when he thus appears at last. Christ was Judge of the World, and the Prince thereof, when on Earth, <HI>John ix. 39. and xii. 31.</HI> He is still Judge of the World, the Wickedness and Prince thereof, by his Light, Spi∣rit, and Gospel in Mens Hearts and Consciences, <HI>Joh. xvi. 8, 11. Mat. xii.</HI>

Christ soretold, It shall be more tolerable for them of the Land of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> in the Day of Judgment, than for that City or People that would not receive his Messengers or Mi∣nisters, <HI>&amp;c.

Wherefore, on the 22d of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> in the Year 1694,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694</NOTE> A <HI>Representation of their Case of not Swear∣ing,</HI> being signed in their Behalf by <HI>Theodor Ecclestone,</HI> was delivered to the Members of Parliament, and was as followeth;</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="apology">
<HEAD>A brief Representation of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Case of not Swearing; and why they might have been, and yet may be relieved therein, by <HI>PAR∣LIAMENT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIS a certain Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thereupon <HI>T. Ecclestone</HI> in their Behalf, gives the Mem∣bers of Parlia∣ment a Repre∣sentation of their Case.</NOTE> that among Christians, and Protestants espe∣cially, there are divers particular Things about Religion, con∣scienciously scrupled by some as unlawful, that others esteem ortho∣dox: And therefore it is not to be wondered, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> differ from many others (tho' not from all) in this Case of Oaths; they be∣lieving they are absolutely forbid to swear in any Case, by that po∣sitive Command of Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 44. and the earnest Exhortation of his Apostle, <HI>James</HI> v. 12. And that this is undeniably their Chris∣tian Persuasion, is evidenced by their Sufferings these many Years for not Swearing.</P>
<P>And therefore their Case may be worth the charitable Notice of the Government, by Law to relieve them therein; and not for their reli∣gious Persuasion, to continue them and their Families exposed to Ruin, who among their Neighbours chearfully pay to the Support of the Government, and by their Trades and Industry (according to their Capacities) advance the national Stock.</P>
<P>It may therefore be humbly offered, That 'tis not the Interest of the Government to refuse them Relief.</P>
<P>Their Industry in Trade, both at Sea and Land, bringing Profit to the Government, as well as others; the Station they stand in, as Mer∣chants, Farmers, Manufactors, Improvers of Lands and Stocks, is ad∣vantageous to their Neighbours as truly as others. And as it seems not the Interest of the Government in general, that they should be any Ways discouraged in their honest Industry; so neither is it the In∣terest of an eminent Part of the Government, that they should not be relieved, <HI>viz.</HI>
due Judges.</P>
<P>For the frequent Suits that are brought against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> before the Chancery and Exchequer Judges, are no do doubt very troublesome and burdensome, by the Difficulty of getting at a just Issue, for Want of Swearing; whereby Justice is delayed, and their Causes often held very long; and no doubt when just Judges see the <HI>Quakers</HI> wrong'd, and abused, and can't relieve them, 'tis irksome to them: So that 'tis humbly conceiv'd, 'twould be a great Ease to those Courts, to have the <HI>Quakers</HI> reliev'd in this Case of Oaths.</P>
<P>Neither is it without Advantage to the King's other Courts, to be able to use the Evidence of one who is now a <HI>Quaker,</HI> that perhaps
<PB N="624" REF="003104_0635_0FEFF912FA403B40"/>was not so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694</NOTE> same Years ago; when he was a Witness to a Bill, Bond, Book-debt, or Deed of Indenture; or when he was Steward, or Tru∣stee, or Servant, either to Persons of Quality, or to others of Trade, or Estate.</P>
<P>Nor may their Testimony be unuseful to Coroners, in Case of un∣natural Deaths; nor inconvenient in Cases of Trespass or Felony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And it is farther proposed, That it is not the Interest of the Sub∣ject to continue them unrelieved: For it is not the Interest of those the <HI>Quakers</HI> are indebted to; because, tho' such may sue and harrass the <HI>Quakers</HI> in Person and Estate, yet they may long want a Decis
on of their Debt or Claim, as to the Right of it, for Want of an Answer upon Oath.</P>
<P>It is not the Interest of those they are concerned with, in any doubtful Case, because of the Difficulty to come to Trial.</P>
<P>And for those that owe Money to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> to be allowed to fly into Chancery for a Refuge, to obstruct paying just Debts, is such an Injury, as 'tis hop'd, no one that is rational will countenance, or de∣sire should be continued upon them. And may it nor then be asserted, that 'tis no honest Man's true and just Interest, (to have the <HI>Quakers</HI> denied Relief) no not the Gown-men of <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> whose few Fees from the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as Plaintiffs might suggest (tho' unduly) that they have no long tail'd Debts to sue for, nor Titles to recover; but if they so suppose, it's a Mistake, for 'tis rather their Despair or Re∣lief, and their well-known Inability to pursue a Cause, that is their common determent to begin.</P>
<P>So that of all Causes that croud those Courts, few are brought by the <HI>Quakers,</HI> tho' they may need it as much as others, to the great Loss of the Learned in the Law, as well as the poor injured <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P>And one might think 'twere great Pity an industrious People should be kept liable to all injurious Suits, and so much barr'd from Suing for their Rights, be their Cause never so reasonable, just or necessary.</P>
<P>Seeing their Relief is to them so needful, so harmless to all, and so useful to the Government, and their Neighbours; let's a little con∣sider the common Objections, which may be sum'd up in short thus:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>First Objection, <HI>How shall we then be at a Certainty?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, <HI>Why should the Laws be alter'd for them? For,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, <HI>'Twould be to raze old Foundations.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourthly, <HI>And let them into the Government.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Which it's hoped will not be difficult to answer one by one, and that to reasonable Satisfaction.</P>
<P>And to the first, <HI>viz. The Doubt of Certainty.</HI> It may be rationally affirmed, That whosoever is bound to tell the Truth, (especially against Mens own Interest, where the Temptation, if any, mainly lies) such are either so bound by the Law of God, or the Laws of Men, or both.</P>
<P>Now the Obligations by the Law of God are binding on good Men, whether they give Answers on Oath, or on their solemn Affirmation in the Fear of God; and Knaves are only bound by the penal Laws of Men; which if made equally severe, to those that give fallacious An∣swers, as well without Oath as by Oath, would be equally effectual and binding, both to them that give Answers without Swearing, and to them that Swear.</P>
<P>The Second Objection, <HI>That 'twould be an Alteration of the Law;</HI> Not of the Substance; of the Law, but of a Circumstance; and if that hath no Detriment in it, but that the Alteration be really an Amend∣ment, and a Conveniency to an honest, industrious People, pray why should it not be done? What Sessions of Parliament is there, that
<PB N="625" REF="003104_0636_0FEFF95590DB2F80"/>passes, but some Law or other is made for the Ease, Security, or Re∣lief of the Subject?</P>
<P>If Foreigners are too hard for our sea-faring People, out goes an Act of Navigation to prevent it.</P>
<P>If our Poor at home want Silk to work with, how soon is it granted? (notwithstanding the same Act) to come over Land, and not directly in Shipping from the Places of its Produce, as the said Act before did enjoin: And shall the Ease of Trade be so soon granted against a po∣sitive Statute; and the Ease of Conscience be so long denied in this, as positive a Command of Christ, at least really so believed and accepted?</P>
<P>And for the Third Objection, <HI>That 'tis to raze old Foundations.</HI> An∣swer, <HI>No,</HI> as 'twas said, 'tis rather to mend them; a proper Work for Parliaments.</P>
<P>Did not Parliaments abrogate Popery, with all its Claim of Anti∣quity? Did not a Parliament make the Act of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> against the Claim of Prerogative? And was it more reasonable to secure the Subject from perpetual Imprisonment by a King, without Trial, than it is to secure one Subject from imprisoning another till Death, for not giving an Answer in Chancery, or Exchequer, upon Oath? Does it be∣long to Parliaments to secure other Subjects in their Estates, Liberties, and Properties? And is it unparliamentary, to secure the <HI>Quakers</HI> from Sequestrations against their whole Estates? because they dare not com∣ply to a Circumstance of the Law, when (as they understand it) 'tis against an express Command of Christ? Surely no: And therefore their Relief in Parliament is a sitting Case to be there tenderly taken Notice of, and provided for.</P>
<P>May it not then be well worth the While for this present Parliament, to relieve these distressed People, and afford their suffering Case Re∣dress? That thereby their Causes may the sooner come to an Issue; whether they sue for just Debts, or are sued; whereby many unjust and vexatious Suits, by injurious and litigious Persons, may be pre∣vented, which have often tended rather to the <HI>Quakers</HI> Ruin, and o∣thers Damage, than Recovery of their Right.</P>
<P>As to the Fourth Objection, <HI>That 'twill tend to let them into the Government:</HI> For Answer thereto, Bar that as hard as you please; only don't let the Supposal of that, from which so easily and so wil∣lingly they may be excluded, be a Hindrance to that Ease and Benefit the Government may so easily afford them.</P>
<P>But now while you have Opportunity by the Station Providence hath placed you in, pray be you of such noble, generous Spirits, as to re∣lieve them, tho' they differ from you in the Construction of a Text they esteem plain and positive on their Side, and from which they dare not swerve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrysostom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Swinder∣by<HI>'s Appeal to the King.</HI></NOTE> having therein the Concurrence of many ancient Fathers, and Martyrs, and since them the <HI>Mennists,</HI> and of late <HI>Francis Osbourne,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in his <HI>Political Reflections,</HI> 7th Edition, p. 319. who treating of Judicial Cases, calls <HI>Not swearing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Walter Brute</HI>'s Decla∣ration Act, &amp; Monuments, <HI>Vol. I. 570</HI>new Edition <HI>Young</HI>'s First Exam. fol. 910. old Edition; with abundance others.</NOTE> a yielding a sincere and faithful Obedience to the Precept of our Saviour, <HI>Swear not at all,</HI> (which [says he] the corrupt Glosses of Expositors labour much, tho' all in vain, to clude.)</P>
<P>And <HI>Swinderby,</HI> in his Appeal to the King, complaining of the Er∣rors of the <HI>Papists</HI> says thus, <HI>As Christ forbids Swearing, so</HI> [says he] <HI>the Pope justifieth Swearing, and compels Men to Swear.</HI></P>
<P>Which no Man can rationally say, is only spoken of Swearing in Communication, for his Complaint is against justifying Swearing, and compelling Men to Swear, which cannot be pretended to mean other than solemn Swearing; for no Age, that we read of, did ever autho∣rize profane Swearing, much less compel to it.</P>
<P><PB N="626" REF="003104_0637_0FEFF91527435C70"/>Since therefore not only profane Swearing, but also solemn Swearing was early complained of by Protestants, let it not seem strange to any, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> now scruple Swearing, and for Ease therein have often sought Relief in Parliament, the proper Place.</P>
<P>Seeing then they believe they have the Authority of Christ's Com∣mand, and the Apostle's Exhortation, and the Martyrs Doctrine on their Side; tho' divers of you, are not so persuaded;</P>
<P>Yet let the World behold your Justice and Willingness (according to your Power) to do Good to all the honest and industrious People you both represent and govern; by enacting, <HI>That their Solemn Affirmation shall be accepted in Lieu of an Oath; and all that falsify therein, shall be punished equally with perjured Persons.</HI></P>
<P>It having been made appear to a Committee of this Parliament, [<HI>Dec.</HI> 2. 1692] that they are exposed to great Hardships, as aforesaid; and not themselves only, but others also; [which was the Case of a Member, or two of this present Parliament.]</P>
<P>So that upon the whole Matter, the said Committee were of Opi∣nion, and did report it to the House, <HI>That the Quakers ought to be relieved according to the Prayer of their Petition,</HI> [then newly present∣ed to the House.]</P>
<P>Wherefore, as Liberty hath been given them to declare their Alle∣giance to the Government without Swearing, for which Ease they are sincerely thankful; so be pleased to add to that Kindness, their Relief in the Matter of Oaths, between them and other Subjects, as well as between the Government and them.</P>

<P>Tho' after the delivering of the said Representation, the Parliament this Year came not to a full Resolution for their Relief, yet several Members shewed themselves more inclined to it, and in the next Year the Matter was taken in Hand again in good Earnest.</P>
<P>Toward the Conclusion of this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mary</HI> the Second, Queen of <HI>England,</HI> deceased: She was a Princess eminent beyond many, being well vers'd in Reading, and of a great Knowledge, of which I'll mention only this Passage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English</HI> Ambassador at the <HI>Hague</HI> in vain endeavours to reconcile her to the Popish Religion.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> That the Ambassador of the King her Father at the <HI>Hague,</HI> having tried by many Arguments to bring her over to the Papal Religion, said afterwards in the Presence of some great Men, <Q>That he never before believed that a Woman was to be found any where so well experienced in the Doctrine of Christian Religion; and that therefore he would not advise any to enter into Discourse with her about that Matter.</Q> On the 21st of <HI>December</HI> some Symptoms of the Small-pox appeared on the Queen, who had been ill a Day or two before; and her Distemper suddenly encreased to that Degree, that the Physicians began to despair of her Recovery; But this was so far from frighting her, that she said, <HI>God be thanked, I am prepared.</HI> And this Quietness of Mind did not leave her, even when she felt Death approaching; for then she was heard to say, <HI>I believe now that I shall die shortly; and I thank God, that from my Youth I have learned this true Doctrine, that Repentance ought not to be deferr'd to a Dying-Bed.</HI> In such a Christian Disposition she continued to her dying Hour, and so quietly gave up the Ghost to her Creator from whom she had received it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King con∣stantly with her in the Time of her Sickness</NOTE> departing at <HI>Kensington</HI> not long after Mid-night, between the 26th and 27th of <HI>December,</HI> and lest the King in unspeakable Sor∣row, who, in all the Time of her Sickness, 'tis said, had not departed

<P>Now I return again to the Case and Affairs of the <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>

A∣mong these was <HI>John Thurborn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And in parti∣cular of <HI>John Thurborn.</HI></NOTE> Marshal to Colonel <HI>Tidcomb,</HI> who used scoffingly to call the <HI>Quakers</HI> his <HI>Milch-Cows,</HI> saying, <HI>That</HI> George Gray (one of these People) <HI>was one of his best Cows, and gave a brave Mess of Milk every Exercising-Day.</HI> For he and other such Birds of Prey, took always much more than the Fine amounted to: But at length he died in Poverty, being afflicted with a Fistula in his Funda∣ment, that did admit of no Cure.</P>
<P>It was not only for not bearing Arms, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> suffered thus; but frequent Occasions were sought to vex them. For when they (to bring their Negroes, if possible, to some Knowledge of the true God) caused them to meet together for an Hour or two once a Week, to instruct them according to their Capacity, by reading to them some Part of the Holy Scriptures, and speaking something to this Purpose, a Law was made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Law made forbidding <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> to let their Negroes be pre∣sent at their Meetings.</NOTE> forbidding the <HI>Quakers</HI> to let their Negroes come into their Meetings, tho' kept in their own Houses, on Pain of forfeiting eve∣ry such Negro as was found there, or ten Pounds instead thereof.

But tho' the Justice <HI>John Merrick</HI> did what he could to countenance the said <HI>Cobham,</HI> yet after several Sessions of the Court, at which the said Justice was an Assistant, Judgment was given in favour of the Defendant; and it was remarkable that the abovesaid <HI>Cobham,</HI> tho' a lusty likely young Man, became dejected, and generally slighted; and soon after was taken with a Fever and an Inflammation in his Neck and Throat, which so increas'd, that towards his latter End he cried out, <HI>Fire, Fire; I am all on Fire;</HI> and to his Mother he said, <HI>She needed not provide a Coffin for him; for he should be burnt up before it was made,</HI> crying out, <HI>Neither Heaven nor Hell, but all Fire, Fire;</HI> to which he added, <HI>Now the</HI> Quakers <HI>will say, it is a Judgment fallen on me.</HI> After this Manner he miserably ended his Days.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dismal End of other Pre∣secutors of this new Law, <HI>viz.</HI> of Justice <HI>Mer∣rick.</HI></NOTE> And Justice <HI>Merrick</HI>'s Exit was also dismal: For ri∣ding to his House, after having drank too much, he was thrown from his Horse, whereby his Brain was so hurt, that he lay some Days in a violent raving Condition, to the Terror of his Friends, and so died.

When once a Person was brought before him for not appearing in Arms, and told him, <HI>He could not do so for Conscience-sake,</HI> he returned, <HI>God damn your Conscience; if I cannot make your Con∣science how, I'II make your stubborn Dog's Back bend,</HI> and so tied him Neck and Heels with his own Hands, so violently, that he almost de∣prived the Man of Life. He also once, when a Declaration of War was published in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>land, said, That <HI>the first Time an Enemy appeared, he would hang up the</HI> Quakers, binding his Words with abominable Oaths, to which he was so accustomed, that he seldom spoke without them. But now at length the Time came, that he must remove from this to the other World. He had been sick, and being pretty well re∣cover'd, he boasted among his Companions of <HI>his Conquest over Death,</HI> and daringly said, That <HI>he had taken a ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I ease of his Life from God Almighty for thirty Years longer.</HI> But within a few Months after, the Thread of his Life was cut, and his pretended Lease was taken from him by the Sovereign of the Universe.

He caused one of the Society of the <HI>Quakers</HI> to be rated four hundred Pounds of Sugar, for Payment of the Priest's Wages, who was his Son-in-Law; whereas upon Complaint of the said Person, and upon Enquiry, it ap∣peared that the pretended Due was but ten Pounds of Sugar; And it was well known, that he and his Friends duly paid for maintaining the Poor, and for mending Highways: But all this could not avail him; for a Cow was taken from him worth ten Pounds Sterling. And tho' some of the Magistrates, seeing the Unreasonableness of these Proceedings, would have had the Cow returned to the right Owner, yet such was the Power of the said <HI>Ruddock,</HI> that they were not able to withstand it. And be∣cause the aforesaid Man had complained of the Wrong and Oppression he suffered,, this so incensed <HI>Ruddock,</HI> that he caused him to be fined five Pounds Sterling, for having refused to take the Oath as Constable, tho' he was willing to have served the Office. And for this Fine <HI>Rud∣dock</HI> issued out a Warrant against him, upon which was taken from him a Negro-Woman, that by the Management of <HI>Ruddock</HI> was valued at but two thousand three hundred Pounds of Sugar, which, as the Price of Sugar then went, might amount to eleven Pounds ten Shillings; and yet the Negro was sold for six and twenty Pounds Sterling, and all kept for the Fine of Five Pounds.

mong these also many of the vulgar Sort, who generally are sickle and unsteady, and often inclined to Novelties; tho' <HI>Keith</HI> would as yet in some Respecct be look'd upon us an Adherent of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> he had also given sorth in Print some Papers, wherein he endeavoured to make it appear that they held several heterodox Sentiments.</P>
<P>The Books which he had published concerning this Matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Charge∣ly answerd</NOTE> were so fully answered by the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that he being at a Loss to make a Reply to their Answers, pretended that he was not in a Condition to set the Press at Work, and bear the Charges of the Impression. But that this was a srivolous Evasion, was well known. Yet he, todosome thing, fell upon another Project, and published an Advertisement, that on the 11th of the Month called <HI>June,</HI> he would desend his Charge a gainst the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">e fummons u to meet at Tur. is-Hall, rich they pru-itially decline Reasons read are</NOTE> and therefore he summoned some of them to appear there at that Time, to answer for themselves. He now beginning; to comply with the Episcopalians, had, as he said afterwards, given notice of his Intention to the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who not having forbidden it, he grew the more bold. But the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not think Persons might not have got together, and caused a dangerous Disturb-ance. And therefore they declined to appear there, and gave the following Reasons of their Refusal, which were read in the appointed Meeting, and afterwards published in Print.</P>
<Q><P>WHereas <HI>G. Keith</HI> hath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for not ineeting <HI>G. Keith</HI> at his Summons</NOTE> after his wonted irregular and unruly Manner, challeng'd divers of us to defend our selves against such Charges as he has to exhibit against us at <HI>Turners-Hall;</HI> These are to certifie all whom it may concern, That the Reasons why we decline any such Meeting, are as follow;</P>
<P N="1">1. Because the said <HI>G. Keith</HI> has given us such frequent Proofs of his very passionate and abusie Behaviour, at the many more Select Meetings we have had with him, in all Manner of Sweetnes s, Long-suffering and Patience, on our Side, to satisfie and preserve him from these Extreams: That we cannot assure ourselves now of any better Entertainment, or that the Meeting can have any desirable Success, for a thorough Information.</P>
<P N="2">2. We decline to meet, because it is not an agreed Meeting on both Sides, which it ought to have been; and where that is not, or can-not be adjusted; the Press is the next sair Way and Expedient, which he has begun with, and now seems to decline; nor hath he sent us a Copy of his Charge or Indictment against us, which also he ought to have done.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he has two of our Books which lie hard at his Door; in Vindication of us and our Doctrines from his Exceptions, and which he has not yet answered; so that he is not upon equal Terms with us; and therefore we think his Challenge, <HI>Appointment</HI> and <HI>Sumnous</HI> unsair; and that all that are not partial will be of the same Mind with us.</P>
<P N="4">4. Such <HI>publick</HI> and <HI>unlimited</HI> Meetings are too often attended with Heats, <HI>Levity</HI> and <HI>Confusion,</HI> and answer not the End, desired by sober and enquiring Men. Besides, that it lets up a Practice that Autho∣rity may judge to be an <HI>Abuse</HI> to our Liberty and so draw that un∣der Resiectoin as no Friend to the Civil Peace.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="633" REF="003104_0644_0FEFF9626A390178"/>
5. We know not what Religion or Persuasion this <HI>Wavering</HI> Man is of, or what Church or People he adhcres to, or will receive him, with his <HI>vain Sp
culations,</HI> that have led him to desert us; nor who are accountable to us for him and his <HI>Irregularities</HI> and <HI>Abuses;</HI> the generality of such Assemblies usually making ill Auditors, worse Judges, and no good Security for our Satisfaction. And we must therefore take Leave to say, it seems to us an indirect Way of <HI>disquieting</HI> and <HI>invading</HI> our present Liberty, that <HI>so irreligious a Meeting should be held, whose End is to abuse other Men for their Religion.</HI> If this should be imitated by all the several Sorts of different Persuasions in this City, what Heats and Confusions must necessarily ensue?</P>
<P N="6">6. Wherefore, Lastly, Be it known unto all, That <HI>for the sake of Religion, the Liberty granted us, and the Civil-Peace,</HI> we decline to meet him; and not from any Apprchensions we have of his Abilities, or our own Consciousness of Error, or Injustice to the said <HI>G. Keith,</HI> whose weak and unbridled Temper we know is such, that what Learn∣ing and Parts he hath, have not been able to ballance and support him on less Occasions, so that we may say they are in ill Hands; and if he procweds as he begins, they will be employed to an ill End, which his (poor Man!) cannot but be, unless he change his Course; which we heartily pray for, that a Place of Repentance he may find; and thro' a true Contrition, the Remission of his great Sin on Envy, and evilly intreating the Lord's People and Way, which we profess, and which he the said <HI>G. Keith</HI> hath long and lately both professed, and zealously vindicated as such.</P></Q>
<P>These Reasons the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as hath been said, published in Print, to shew the World, that it was not without a weighty Cause, that they did not accept <HI>G. Keith</HI>'s Summons. Now tho' <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> and <HI>W. Penn,</HI> for the above said Reasons did not appear in Turners-Hall, yet some of their Friends were there as Spectators, to see what would be the Issue of this Business. <HI>G. Keith</HI> seeing himself thus disappointed in his Intention, took upon him for all that, to defend his Charge in the Absence of his Adversaries, which now he could do easily, since none con∣tradicted him, and he was applauded by the frequent Shoutings of the Mob that was there in great Numbers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which he oh-jects to very srieclously</NOTE> After the Reasons of Nonap pearance were read, Keith signified that they were not satisfactory, by calling them slender, weak and frivolous.<HI>What,</HI> said he, may a Male factor make this Excuse, <HI>You shall not call me before a Justice without my Consent? If a man robs me, I may complain of him as a Robbrer, and without his Consent call him to account. But here is a st range thing: If in juring Men may not be called to account without their Consent, it will tres pass against the Law, and intrenches upon Liberty of Conscience.</HI> This Reason he published in Print in his Narrative of that Day's Work. But who would formerly ever have thought that such a little Man as he was, would have been so big. It look'd just as if the <HI>Quakers</HI> were obliged to appear as Malefactors before the pretended Judge <HI>Keith,</HI> ac companied with his Assistants the Mob, and I don't know who. And to keep to <HI>G. Keith's</HI> Companion, Tho' a Malesactor may not say, <HI>You shall not call me before a Justice without my Consent.</HI> yet with somc good Reason he might say, <HI>You shall not make yourself a Justice,</HI> as <HI>Keith</HI> now did. It is proable that he was supported by some great Church∣men, otherwise such a bold Action might casily have turned to his Disadvantage.</P>
<P>My Limits do not admit of a circumstanstial Relation of what was transacted at that Time in <HI>Turnvers-Hall;</HI> yet to shew briesly how he treated Matters, I'll produce one or two Instancen, by which my Reader

He said, he would charge the <HI>Quakers</HI> with nothing but what he could prove from their own Writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His abusive Perversion of G. W's Wri∣tings</NOTE> and he went on thus:<HI>I offer to prove</HI> that G. White∣head <HI>hath denied Christ both to be God and Man.</HI> A strange Thing in deed, since it was very well known that <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> had published a Book of above twenty Sheets, under this Title, <HI>The</HI> DIVINITY of CHRIST, <HI>and Unity of the Three that bear Record in Heaven, with the blessed End and Effect of Christ's Appearance coming in the Flesh, Suffer∣ings and Sacrifice for Sinners, confessed and vindicated by his Followers called</HI> Quakers. This Book <HI>G, Keith</HI> could not pretend Ignorance of, for he pick'd somewhat out of it an his Narrative. But to maintain his Charge, he appeal'd to a Book of <HI>G. Whitehead</HI>'s called, <HI>The Light and Life of Christ within.</HI> This Book <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> had written in Answer to <HI>W. Burnet,</HI> a <HI>Baptist</HI> Preacher, who writing of Christ said, <HI>As he was God, he was Co-Creator with the Father, and so was'before</HI> Abraham, <HI>and had Glory with God before the world was, and in this Sense came down from Heaven.</HI> To which <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> answered, <HI>What Nousense and unscripture-like Language is this, to tell of God being Co-Creator with the Father? Or that God had Glory with God? Doth not this imply two Gods, and that God had a Father? Let the Reader judge.</HI> Certainly it appcars from this plainly, that <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> did not intend any thing else but to censure the unseriptural Expressions of his Antagonist, as <HI>Co-Creator,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. iii. 20. John x. 30</NOTE> and implying two Gods: For not only the Apostle faith, <HI>God is one,</HI> but Christ himself faith, <HI>I and the Father are one.</HI> Yet <HI>G. Keith</HI> did not stick to say, G. Whitehead <HI>denieth the Divinity of Christ, and he deceives the Nation and theParliament, by telling them, The Quakers own Christ to be both God and Man, and-believe all that is recorded of him in the Holy Scripture.</HI> This he strove to prove from a Passage taken out of the aforementioned Book, which in Sense agreed with the former; and speaking in another Page of the same Matter, viz. <HI>The</HI> Baptists <HI>calling God the Word, Co-Creator with the Father. G.Whitehead</HI> answers thus to it, <HI>To tell of the Word God, Co-Creator with the Father, is all one as to tell of God being Co-Creator with God, if the Father be God', and this is to make two Gods and two Creators: For God Co-Creator with the Father plainly implies two.</HI> Was this shewing of others their absurd Expressions, a Denial that Christ was God, as <HI>Keith</HI> would have it? Might it not be asked here, whether the acute Wit of <HI>Keith</HI> was now altogether flown away? But a great; Part of his Auditory consisted of an ignorant Crew, and one or other of them was continually heard to cry out, <HI>It is sufficient.</HI></P>
<P>Now to prove that <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> had denied <HI>Christ to be Man, Keith</HI> cited from the forementioned Book, called, <HI>The Divinity of Christ,</HI> &amp;c. these Words, <HI>If the Body and Soul of the Son of God were both created, doth not this render him a fourth Person?</HI> Here <HI>Keith</HI> stopt, and broke off with an &amp;c. without adding the following Words; <HI>For Creation was in Time, which contradicts the Doctrine of three distinct, uncreated, Co-eter∣nal, Co-essential Persons in the Deity, secing that which was ere 'ted, was not so.</HI> This <HI>G. Whitchead</HI> ask'd and said to shew his Opponent <HI>T. Dan∣sou</HI> the Absurdity of his Assertions about the Personalities of the Deity. But <HI>Keith</HI> went on reading from <HI>G. Whitehead</HI>'s Book, thus, <HI>Where doth the Scripture say, That his Soul was created? For was not he the Bright∣uess of the Father's Glory, and the express Image of his divine Substance. But supposing the Soul of Christ was with the Body created in Time, &amp;c.</HI> Here <HI>Keith</HI> broke off again, omitting the following Words; <HI>I ask, if from Eternity he was a Person distinct from God and his holy Spirit, without either Soul or Body? Where doth the Scripture speak of any Person with∣out either Soul or Body? Let's have plain Scripture.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="635" REF="003104_0646_0FEFF9650D143C70"/>Now tho' <HI>G.Wbitebead</HI> had written this to shew, how we often enter into inextricable Straits, when we do not keep to the Words of the holy Scripture, which qo where speaks of <HI>Three Persous in the Deity:</HI> Yet <HI>Keith</HI> perverting the Passage abusively, said to his Auditory, <HI>Here ye see he will not own that Christ had a created Soul.</HI> At this Rate and after this Manner <HI>Keith</HI> reasoned, and treated the other Passages. But how smartly would he have carpt at others, if they had cited his Words thus piece-meal?</P>
<P>But now he had a temporal Reward in his View; and seeing for that End he began more and more to declare himself in Favour of the Episco∣pal Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. C. endra vours to shew Keith to be an Apostate in a very Respect</NOTE> somebody of that Persuasion, who did no farther make him∣self known, than by these initial Letters W.C. made it his Business to shew the Changeableness of <HI>Keith</HI>'s Opinion and Sentiments from his own Writings, which he had published in Print, and there by evidently proved, that in every respect <HI>Keith</HI> was turned an Apostate, tho' he ap∣peared much offended at the <HI>Quakers,</HI> because they had called him so: But said this Author, <HI>If the</HI> Presbyterian <HI>Principles</HI> (of which Society <HI>Keith</HI> once was a Member) <HI>were better than the</HI> Quakers, <HI>then is Mr.</HI> Keith <HI>an Apostate, in revolting from and deserting the</HI> Presbyterians <HI>and turning his Coat</HI> Quaker-<HI>fashion.

<P>Now he appeared to sawn on the Episcopal Clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. K. by oppo-sing the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> seems to hope for the best Recompence from the Epit copaliams</NOTE> and estcemed law∣ful what formerly he had zealously oppugned. For he was in hopes that by opposing the <HI>Quakers,</HI> he should be best rewarded among the Episco∣palians; and this was not altogether without Reason; for it being no more in their Power now to persecute the <HI>Quakers</HI> in Manner as formerly, they made Use of other Means as much as possibly they could, to render them and their Dorine odious; for which <HI>Keith</HI> seemed to them no unsit Tool; for he being both of a witty and impetuous Temper, was also crafty, subtle, cunning, and violent in his Expressions. And to charge the <HI>Quakers</HI> with Inorthodoxy, he himself lanch'd into an he-torodox Sentiment: For it was believed, that for maintaining this Po∣sition, <HI>That the Historical Knowledge of Christ's Sufferings, Death, Resur∣rection, Lc. was absolutely necessary for Salvation,</HI> he had no other Ground than the twelve pretended Transmigrations or Transitions of Man's Soul from one Body into another; because the ignorant Souls from hence seemed to get Opportunity of being informed before the End of the World, concerning the Death and Resurrection of our Saviour.

According to my best Knowledge of the People called</HI> Quakers, <HI>and those owned by them, as preachers and publishers of their Belief, being of an un∣questionable Esteem among them, and worthy of double Honour; as there are many such, I know none of them that are guilty of such Hcresies and Blasphemies as they are charged with. And I think I should know and do know those called</HI> Quakers, <HI>havil been conversant with them in publick Meetings as well as in private Disicourses, with the most noted and estcemed among them, for about twenty-eight Years pust, and that in many Plates of the World, both in</HI> Europe <HI>and</HI> America. Who would ever have thought then, that one who had conversed so many Years with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> preached their Doctrine, and desended it publickly both by Writing and by Word of Mouth, should afterwards have decried them, as Denicrs of the most essential Points of the Christian Faith!

And since some others, suborned thereto, did not omit also to render the <HI>Quakers</HI> odious, as such that held inorthodox Sentiments, these did not neglect to shew in Print, how they were injured and wronged. For now the old Tale, <HI>That there were Popish Emissaries among them,</HI> was revived and divulged anew.

<Q><P>Whereas there has been a horrible and dctestable Conspiracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Association of the H. of Commons.</NOTE> formed and carried on by Papists, and other wicked and traiterous Persous for assassinating his Majesty's Royal Person, in order to encourage an Inva-sion from France, to subvert our Religion, Laws and Liberties, We whose Names are hereunto subseribed do heartily, sincerely and soleinly profess testify, and declare, that his present Majesty King William is rightful and lawful King of these Realms. And we do mutually promise and engage to stand by and assist each other, to the at most of our 'Power, in the Support and Defence of his Majesty's most sacred Person and Government against the late King James, and all his Adherents.

<HEAD>The Ancient Testimony and Principle of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> re∣newed with Respect to the King and Government, and touching the Present Association.</HEAD>
<P>WE the said People do solemnly and sincerely declare,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quakers</HI> Tes∣timony relating to the Associa∣tion.</NOTE> That it hath been our Judgment and Principle from the first Day we were called to profess the Light of Christ Jesus manifested in our Con∣sciences, unto this Day, That the setting up, and putting down Kings and Governments, is God's peculiar Prerogative, for Causes best known to himself; and that it is not our Work or Business to have any Hand or Contrivance therein, nor to be Busy-bodies in Matters above our Station; much less to Plot and Contrive the Ruin or Overturn of any of them: But to pray for the King, and for the Safety of our Nation, and Good of all Men, that we may live a peaceable and quiet Life, in all Godliness and Honesty under the Government which God is pleased to set over us.</P>
<P>And according to this our Ancient and Innocent Principle, we often have given forth our Testimony, and now do, against all Plotting, Conspiracies and contriving Insurrections against the King or the Go∣vernment) and against all Treacherous, Barbarous, and Murtherous Designs whatsoever, as Works of the Devil and Darkness: And we sin∣cerely bless God, and are heartily thankful to the King and Go∣vernment, for the Liberty and Priviledges we enjoy under them by Law; esteeming it our Duty to be true and faithful to them.</P>
<P>And whereas we the said People are required to sign the said Asso∣ciation, we sincerely declare, that our refusing so to do, is not out of any Disaffection to the King or Government, nor in Opposition to his being declared rightsul and lawsul King of these Realms, but purely because we cannot for Conscience-sake fight, kill, or revenge, either for our selves, or any Man else.</P>
<P>And we believe that the timely Discovery and Prevention of the late barbarous Design, and mischievous Plot against the King and Go∣vernment, and the sad Effects it might have had, is an eminent Mer∣cy from Almighty God; for which we, and the whole Nation, have great Cause to be humbly thankful to him, and to pray for the Con∣tinuance of his Mercies to them and us.</P>

<P>In this Year died of a Fever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>R. Haydock,</HI> and Character by <HI>Eleanor</HI> his Widow</NOTE> <HI>Roger Haydock,</HI> at his House in <HI>Penketh</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> about the Age of fifty three Years. He had been in Holland the Year before, in which Time I had more than once Opportunity to speak with him privately, and discovered thereby such Christian Qualities in him, that were indeed excellent; and therefore the News of his Decease did much affect me; and because of his Ministry, in which he was eminent, being more than ordinary full of Matter in his Preaching, his Death was much lamented among those Churches in <HI>England</HI> where he had laboured most in the Gospel. His Wife <HI>Eleanor</HI> in her Testimony concerning him said, My Spirit hath been, and is bowed under, a deep Sense of my great Loss and Exercise in the Removal of my dear Husband, when it hath pleased God in his Wisdom to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> me
<PB N="638" REF="003104_0649_0FEFF9AAC90C77A0"/>
who was Comfort to my Life, and Joy to my Days in this world, being given me of God, in great Mercy and loving Kindness; and so he hath been en joyed by me in Thankfulness of Heart, to the Close of that Time God had appointed and now is taken from the Worlds with all its Troubles and Excreises, as also from all his labours and 'Travels, which were great amongst the Churches of Christ, which with me have no small Loss in his Removal. But what shall say? Wise and good is the Lord, who doth what he will in Heaven and in Earth, and amongst his Churches and his Chosen. He can break and bind up, wound and head, kill and make alive again, that the Living may see his Wonders, and magnify his 'Power in all, thro' all and over all, who is God eternal, blessed for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Then in her Testimony she gives an Account of his Life, and how in her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oup Pears he had been to her a faithful Instructor in Godliness and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> became her Husband. After a Description of his Life, and his many Travels in the Ministry of the Gospel, to edisy and build up the Churches, the saith also, That <HI>Tho' his Love to her was above all vi∣sibles,</HI> as the best of Enjoyments he had in this World, yet she was not too "dear to him to give up to serve the Truth of God. I was made (saith the) a Blessing to him, more comfortable every Day than other: He would often express it; and truly so was he to me every Day, every Way, and in every Respect. No Tongue or Pen can relate the Full of that Comfort and Joy we had in God, and one in another. Tet we find such hath been the Pleasure of 'God concerning them he hath loved, to try them in the most near and dear Enjoyments, that it might be manifest he was loved ahovt, all; that no Gifts may be preserved above the Giver; but that he may be all in all, who is, and is to come, God blessed for ever and ever. And truly there hath been great Care and Watchsuluess one over another, and over our own Spirits, to see that our Love, tho' great, was bounded and kept within its Compass, the Truth being its Original, the Alpha and Omega also. Altho' it hath been the Pleasure of God to try me, in the Removal of so great a Bles∣sing from me, sure it is,, that I may be the more inward to him, and have his Love always in my Remembrance, who gives and takes away, and in till bless his Name. My Soul travels that I may always follow his Footsteps of Self-Denial in all Things, that 1 may finish my Course in this World, to the Glory of God, as he did, and have my Part in that Mansion of Glo∣y with him eternal in the Heavens; tho' it may be my Lot to pay for a Time in this World of Troubles; yet I have Hope in Immortality and Eternal Blessedness, when Time in this World shall be no more. <HI>Thus Hie writ: But to shun Prolixity,, I break off. She then giving some further Account of his Life and Ministry, mentions, that being gone from home, she was not present at his Death; but that they having taken Leave of each other before, had parted in great Love, with mutual Brewings to God for one another's Welfare: And she concludes with these Words:</HI> Tho' I saw not his Going away, yet I have seen in what he went, that it was full of Zeal and Fervency in the Love of God, and Life of Righte∣ousness. So in pure Submission to the Will of God, I conclude this short but true Relation of my worthy dear Husband, whose Name and Memorial is blessed, and will live, and be of a sweet Savour in the Hearts of the Righteous thro' Ages. <HI>With such a Tcstimony it was that</HI> Eleanor <HI>transmitted the Memorial of her beloved Confort to Posterity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Some CONSIDERATIONS humbly offered by the Peo∣ple called <HI>QUAKERS,</HI> relating to the Bill for restraining the Licenciousness of the Press.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Bill is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for restraining the Press d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pt.</NOTE> They conceive, of like Nature with the expired Act 13 <HI>&amp;</HI> 14 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 33. And many Inconveniences did attend the Subjects by it whilst in Force, by which the said People were Sufferers.</P>
<P>To prevent the Printing and publishing of Seditious or Treasonable Books against the Government, and Scandalous Pamphlets tending to Vice and Immorality, is the wisdom of all good Governments, and must be the Desire of all good Men.</P>
<P>But to Limit Religious Books to a License, where the Tolerated Per∣suasions are many, they conceive, seems altogether unsafe to all, but that whose Opinion the Licenser is of, who by this Bill hath Power to allow what he shall judge Sound and Orthodox, or reject what he shall construe to be either Heretical, Seditious, or Offensive.</P>
<P>History and Experience have taught how the obscure Term of Heresy hath been turned and stretched against Primitive Christians, Martyrs, and famous Reformers: Nor is it forgotten for what Reafons the Writ <HI>De Haeretico Comburendo</HI> was abolished.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">29 Car 2. cap. 9.</NOTE>
<P>'Tis no strange Thing to have Learned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">See Dr. <HI>South</HI> and Dr. <HI>Sherlock.</HI></NOTE> Men of the same Church inter∣fere in their Opinions concerning several Texts of Holy Scripture; and 'tis uncertain when their Opinions come to the Licenser, whether the World shall have the best or no.</P>
<P>The different Apprchensions Men have of divers Parts of Scripture, gives Birth to different Persuasions, who yet all make the Scripture the Test thereof; which by the Kindness of the Government being Tolerated, they conceive, they ought to be left free to defend them, from the Misre∣presentations, Prejudice, or Mistake of others, without being subjetcted to the Censure of a Licenser of a different Persuasion.</P>
<P>They therefore humbly hope, That nothing may be Enacted that will lessen the Toleration, which they thankfully enjoy under the Favour of this, as well as the late Government.</P>

<P>These Considerations, with what others were offered, were of such Effect, that the Bill drop'd.</P>
<P>About this Time the Writings of <HI>Antonia Bourignon</HI> were not only translated into <HI>English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. Bouring∣non's <HI>Writings translated</HI></NOTE> but also published in Print at <HI>London.</HI> This dis∣pleased many of the Clergy, and an Author was employed to write a∣gainst them, but chiefly against the <HI>Quakers.</HI> He called his Book the <HI>snake in the Grass;</HI> but his own Name he concealed; tho' it was dis∣covered afterwards that he was a suppress'd Parson, who had refused the Oath of Allegiance to King <HI>William.</HI> This Man, to render the <HI>Quakers</HI> odious, had pick'd up and collected many Things from their Writings; but he had so mutilated their Expressions, by omitting several Words that went before, or followed, and by skipping over some in the midst of the Period, that they made out quite another Sense than the Authors had given.

<P>Among the Author's Untruths this was one, That the Quakers in their Schools did not suffer the Children to read the Holy Scriptures.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Children,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Must leave you in a wicked Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Advice to his Children and Grandchildren.</NOTE> but commend you to the Mea∣sure of the Grace of God in your inward Parts, which you have received by Jesus Christ; and as you love it, and mind the Teach∣ings of it, you will find it a Counsellor to instruct you in the Way everlasting, and preserve you out of the Ways of the Ungodly.</P>
<P>I have seen much in my Days, and I always observed, that the Fear of the Lord God proved the best Portion, and those that walked in it were the only happy People, both in this Life (while they continued faithful) and when they come to die, tho' they meet with many Hardships in their Passage. By Experience I can speak it, That the Ways of Holiness afford more true Comfort and Peace to the up∣right Soul, than the greatest Pleasures this World can afford; the former reaches the Heart and Soul, while the Delights of this World are but a Shew, and Appearance only, vanishing like a Dream; and whoever believes otherwise of them, will certainly find them to be but lying Vanities; therefore the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 21. might boldly put the Question to the converted <HI>Romans,</HI> (viz.) <HI>What Fruit had you then in those Things whereof you are now ashamed? For the End of those Things is Death.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>Dear Children,</HI> be in Love with Holiness; make it your Companion, and those that walk in it; you may find Buddings of it, from an Holy Seed in your Hearts; as you mind the inner Man, the
<PB N="642" REF="003104_0653_0FEFF9B0E32884D0"/>
Light will manifest the Stirrings of it after God, which I felt from my tende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Years; altho' I understood them not so plainly, till I heard the Truth declared.</P>
<P>I advise you to keep a pure Conscience, both towards God and Man; for if that be desiled, Hypocrisy and Formality will deprive you of all comfortable Feeling of God's Presence; and then Dead∣ness and Dryness will be your miserable Portion.</P>
<P>Be careful how you spend your precious Time, for an Account must be given of every idle Word, tho' but few regard it; but foolish jest∣ing, and vain Talking are said to grieve the Spirit of God; read <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 30. But improve your Time in Prayer, and Religious Exer∣cises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and be diligent in your lawful Callings; for <HI>The Desire of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>othful Man killeth him,</HI> Prov. xxi. 25.</P>
<P>Be careful what Company you frequent; for a Man is commonly known by the Company he keeps, as much as by any one outward Thing; and of your Behaviour in Company; for I have found that a wife and sober Deportment, adds much to a Man's Reputation and Credit in the World.</P>
<P>Watch to the Light, and its Discoveries of Good and Evil, that you may not be ignorant of Satan's Devices; so the Net will be spread in vain in the Sight of the Bird; for Watchfulness will make you in Love with a retired Estate; and the more truly and perfectly any Man knows and understands himself, the better discerning will such have of other Men; as in the Beginning, when deep Silence of all Flesh was more in Use, the Spirit of discerning was more common, and quicker, than since it hath been neglected; therefore be sure you spend some Time (at convenient Seasons) in waiting upon God in Silence, tho' it be displeasing to the Flesh; for I have had more Comfort, and Confirmation in the Truth, in my inward retiring in Silence, than from all Words I have heard from others, tho' I have often been re∣freshed by them also.</P>
<P>Love the Holy Scriptures, prefering them to all other Books what∣soever; and be careful to read them with an holy Awe upon your Spirits, lest your Imaginations put Constructions upon them to your Hurt; but exercise Faith in the Promise of Christ, who hath said, <HI>My Spirit small take of mine, and shew them unto you.</HI></P>
<P>Keep constantly to Religious Meetings amongst Friends; but look to your Aflections, that you respect not Persons, but the Power and Life of Truth, from whomsoever it comes; not minding the Tickling of your Affections, but the Demonstration of the Truth to your Un∣derstanding and Consciences; for that will abide, when Flashes of Affections will fade and come to nothing, after the Words are ended.</P>
<P>Love one another truly, manifesting your Love by good Counsel, and being helpful to each other upon all Occasions; being good Ex∣amples to all you converse with, especially to your Children, and those of your own Families, that Pride and Vanity may not be coun∣tenanced by you, but rather reproved; remembring, while they are under your Government, you must give an Account of the Discharge of your Duty to Gad towards them.</P>
<P>Lastly, Be always mindful of your latter End, and live as you would die, not knowing how soon your Days may be finished in this World: And while you do live in it, despise not the Chastenings of the Lord, whatever they be he is pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fit you withal. I have been afflicted from my Youth up, both inw y and ourwardly, but the God whom I served provided for me, when all my outward Re∣lations forsook me, none of them giving me any Portion to begin the World withal. This I speak to let you know, I shall leave more

outwardly, even to the least of you, than was left me by all my Relations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I need not mention this sharp Affliction (beyond Ex∣pression) in my old Age, because, in some measure, you know it; but 1 could not have been without it, as the Lord hath shewed me, for I have seen his Wonders in the Deeps: Therefore I say again, Despise not Afflictions, but embrace them as Messengers of Peace to your Souls, (tho' displeasing to the Flesh.)</P>
<P>These Things I commend to you, out of true Love to your Souls, knowing how the vain Mind of Man little regards such Advice as this I leave behind me: But by this Advice I shew my true Love to you all, desiring God's Blessing upon it; to whom I commit you all, my Dear Children, and end my Days.</P>

Yet in the latter Part of his Life he often appeared so strong in the Spi∣ritual Warsare, that some judged, that in some Respect he might have said with <HI>Caleb.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh xiv I.</NOTE> <HI>As yet I am as strong this Day as I was in the Day that</HI> Moses <HI>sent me: As my Strangth was then, even so is my Strength now, for War, hath to go out, and to come in.</HI> About three Weeks before his Death, tho' he was weak in Body, yet he said powerfully, and after a prophetical Manner, <HI>Truth must prosper, Truth shall prosper; but a try∣ing Time must first come, and afterwards the Glory of the Lord shall more and more appear.</HI> He continued in a sedate and truly Christian Frame of Mind to the last Period of his Life, and departed the 26th of the Month called <HI>April,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Age and Death</NOTE> in the eighty-second Year of his Age, in his House at <HI>Hertford,</HI> where he had lived many Years.

Of this he gave Notice to the Parliament that was then sifting; who promised <HI>to assist, him to the utmost of their Power, and to maintain the Succession cf the Crown in the Protestant Line.</HI> And an Abjuration was also drawn up, wherein it was declared, <HI>That the aforesaid pretended Prince, who now suffered him∣self to be called</HI> James the Third, King of England, &amp;c. <HI>had no Right or Claim to the Crown of that Kingdom, or any Dominions appertaining thereto.</HI> Now tho' all this was intended for maintaining and assisting the rightful King <HI>William,</HI> yet he lived not to see the Effect of it; for his Time was near expired, and his Glass run, as soon appeared.</P>
<P>About the Beginning of the Month called <HI>March</HI> he went a Hunting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>William</HI> by a Fall from his House, breaks his Collar-bone.</NOTE> and riding a House he never rid on before, the Horse fell, and the King at the same Time broke his Collar-bone: The Fracture was soon set, and all seemed like to do well; but the King having endured many Fatigues and Hardships, had been weak in Body some Time before; insomuch, that this sore Fall seemed to occasion his Sickness which soon followed, and put a Period to his Life.

He was a great Lover of Hunting, that being his most pleasant Diversion, which made him the more fit to endure the Fatigues of War. He was easy of Access, and gave a favourable Hearing to every Body, ind those that spoke to him he treated discreetly; and such was his Devotion, that he

Many had conceived Hopes that this great Prince, in that citical Juncture, should have lived yet some what longer: But his Work was done; and God hath siace that Time shewed very eminently, that he is not limited to any Instruments; and the Queen, who succeeded on the Throne, gave afterwards signal Prooss of it to the World.

<P>Fox then having in <HI>England</HI> been the first of the <HI>Quakers</HI> that preached and proclaimed Christ the Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fruits thereof.</NOTE> which enlightwneth every Man coming into the World, had in a short Time (as we have seen in this History, notwithstanding all Opposition) man Adherents, whereby several others also began to publish that Doctrine. And many of these first Preachers were like Sons of Thunder; for they testiiying of the Light of Christ shining in the Confidences of Men, proclaimed, that the Day of the Lord was dawned, and should yet farther break forth, to the destroying of the former Buildings of human Inventions and Institutions, tho not of that which had formerly beer, selt and enjoyed by true Experience of the Operations of the Spirit of God in People's Hearts. By their powerful Way of Preaching Repentance many were awakened out of the Sleep of caredess Security, and came to see that their Covering was too short, and that they were not clothed with the true Wedding-Garment: And many that had been of a rude Life, came to be so touched to the Heart by these zealous Preachers, that crying out, <HI>What shall we do to he saved?</HI> they were brought to Re∣pentance, and Conversion; and so from wild and rough, came to be sedate and sober. And as in the Beginning many of these first Preachers did run on like a mighty Stream, and seemed sit to thresh and grind Mountains and Stones, and to hew down tall Cedars, and wash away all Opposition; so there were others also, who as Sons of Consolation, proclaimed glad Tidings to the hungry and thirfsty Souls, many of which were in <HI>England</HI> about that Time; insomuch, that some said, <HI>Now the everlasting Gospel is preached again.</HI> And it was indeed remarkable, that tho' these Promulgators of the Doctrinc of the inward Light shine∣ine in the Hearts of Men, were mean and illiterate, yet many People of Note, not only such as were in Magilstracy, but. also many Preachers of several Persuasions, were so touch'd at the Heart by their lively Preaching, that they not only received their Doctrine, but came them∣selves in Process of Time to be zealous Publishers thereof and thus a great Crop was gathered; nay, sometimes even Men of great Skill, and sharp Wit were deeply struck by plain and homely Preaching; of whom</P>

<P>In this Sense of my lost Estatc, I sought after the Lord, I read Scriptures, watched over mine own Heart, I cried unto the Lord for what I felt the Want of, I blessid his Nairn in what he mercifully did for me, and bestowed on me, &amp;c. Whatever I read in the Scriptures, as the Way of God to my Understanding, I gave my self to the faithful Practice of; being contented to meet with all the Reproach, Opposition and several Kinds of'S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣serings,. which it pleased the Lord to mcasure out to me therein. And I
<PB N="649" REF="003104_0660_0FEFF977003062B8"/>
cannot but say, that the Lord was good unto me, did visit me, did teach me, did help we, did testify his Acceptance of me many Times, to the re∣freshing and Joy of my Heart before him.</P>
<P>But my Soul was not satisfied with what I met with, nor indeed could be, there being further quickuings and pressings in my Spirit, after a more full, certain and satisfaclory Knowledge; even after the Sense,, Sight and Enjoyment of God, as was testified in the Scriptures, to have been felt and enjoyed in the former Times: For J saw plainly, that there was a Stop of the Streams, and a great Falling-hort of the Power, Life and Glory which they partoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of. We had not so the Spirit, nor wers so in the Faith, nor did so walk and live in God, as they did. They were come to <HI>Mount</HI> Sion <HI>and the heavenly</HI> Jerusalem, &amp;c. which we had hardly so much as the literal Knowledge or Apprehension what they were. So that I saw the whole Course of Religion among us, was (for the most part) but a Talk to what they felt, enjoyed, possessed and lived in.</P>
<P>This Sense made me sick at Heart indeed, and set me upon deep crying to God, close searching the Scriptures, and waiting on God, that I might receive the pure Sense and Understanding of them, from and in the Light, and by the Help of his Spirit. (And what the Lord did beslow on me in that State, with Thankfulness I remember before him at this very Day: For he was then my God and a Pitier and a Watcher over me; tho' he had not pleased then to direct me, how to stay my Mind upon him and a∣bide with him.) And then I was led, (indeed I was led, I did not run of my self) into a way of Separation from the Worship of the World, into a gathered Society: For this both the Scripture and the Spirit of God in me gave Testimony unto; and what we then met with, and what Leadings and Help we then felt, there is a Remembrance and Testimony in my Heart to this Day. But there was somewhat wanting, and we mustook our Way: For whereas we should have pressed forward into the Spirit and Power, we can too much outward into Letter and Form: And tho' the Lord in many Things helped us, yet therein he was against us, and brought Darkness, Confusion and Scattering upon us. I was sorely broken and darkned, and in this darkned State, sometimes lay still for a long Season, secretly mourning and crying out to the Lord Night and Day; sometimes I ran a∣bout, bearkning after what might apped<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or break forth in others, but ne∣ver met with any Thing, whereto there was the least Answer in my Heart, save in one People, who had a Touch of Truth: But I never expressed so much to any of them, nor indeed felt them at all able to reach my Con∣dition.</P>
<P>At last, after all my Disiresses, Wandarings and sore Travels, I met with some Writings of this People called Quakers, which I cast a slight Eye up∣on and disdained, as falling very short of that Wisdom, Light, Life and Power, which I had been longing for and searching after: I had like wise (some pretty Distance of Time after this) Opportunity of meeting with same of them, and divers of them were by the Lord moved (I know it to be so since) to come to me: As I remember, at the very first they reached to the Life of God in me, which Life answered their voice, and caused a great Love in me to spring to them: But still in my Reasonings with them, and Disputes alone (in my Mind) concerning them, I was very far off from owning them, as so knowing the Lord, or so appearing in his Life and Power as my Condition needed, and as my Soul waited for. Yea, the more I conversed with them, the more I seemed in my Understanding and Reason to get over them, and to trample them under my Feet, as a poor, weak, silly, contemptible Generation, who had some Smatterings of Truth in them, and some honest Desires towards God, but very far off from the clear and full Understanding of his Way and Will. And this was the Effict almost of e∣vrey Discourse with them, they still reached my Heart, and I felt then in
<PB N="650" REF="003104_0661_0FEFF9BC34737998"/>
the Secrets of my Soul, which caused the Love in me always to continue, yea sometimes to encrease towards them: But daily my Understanding got more and more over them, and therein I daily more and more despised them.</P>
<P>After a long Time I was invited to hear one of them (as I had been often, they in tender Love pitying me, and feeling my Want of that, which they possessed) and there was an Answer in my Heart, and I went in Fear and Trembling, with Desires to the most High, who was over all and knew all, that I might not receive any Thing for Truth, which was not of him, nor withstand any Thing which was of him, but might how before the Appearance of the Lord my God, and none other. And indeed, when I came, I felt the Presence and Power of the most High among them, and Words of Truth, from the Spirit of Truth, reaching to my Heart and Conscience, opening my State as in the Presence of the Lord. Yea, I did not only feel Words and Demonstrations from without, but I felt the Dead quickned, the Seed raised, insomuch as my Heart (in the Cer∣tainty of Light, and Clearness of true Sense)said, <HI>This is he, this is he, there is no other; this is He whom I have waited for and fought after from my Childhood, who was always near me, and had often begotten Life in my Heart, but I knew him not distinctly, nor how to receive him or dwell with him.</HI> And then in this Sense (in the Melting and Breakings of my Spirit) was I given up to the Lord to become his, both in waiting for the farther Revealings of his Seed in me, and to serve him in the Life and Power of his Seed.</P>
<P>Now what I met with after this, in my Travels, in my Waitings, in my spiritnal Exercises, is not to be uttered; only in general I may say this, I met with the very Strength of Hell. The cruel Oppressor roared upon me, and made me feel the bitterness of his Captivity, while he had any Power: Yea, the Lord was far from my Help, and from the Voice of my roaring. I also met with deep Subtilties and Devices to entangle me in that Wisdom, which seemeth able to make wise in the Things of God, but indeed is Foolishness and a Snare to the Soul, bringing it back into Captivity, where the Emmy's Gins prevail And what I met with outwardly from my own dear Father, from my Kindred, from my Servants, from the People and Powers of the World, for tio other Cause but fearing my God, worshipping him as he hath required of me, and bowing to his Seed (which is his Son) who is to be worshipped by Men and Angels for evermore; the Lord my God knoweth, before whom my Heart and Ways are, who preserved me in Love to them, in the midst of all I suffered from them, and doth still so preserve me, bles∣sed be his pure and holy Name.</P>
<P>But some may desire to know, what I have at last met with: I answer, <HI>I have met with the Seed.</HI> Understand that Word, and thou wilt be satisfied, and enquire no farther. I have met with my God, I have met with my Saviour; and he hath not been present with me without his Salvation, but I have felt the Healings drop upon my Soul from under his Wings; I have met with the true Knowledge, the Knowledge of Life, the living Knowledge, the Knowledge which is Life, and this hath had the true Vertue in it, which my Soul hath rejoiced in, in the Presence of the Lord. I have met with the Seed's Fa∣ther, and in the Seed I have felt him my Father: There I have read his Nature, his Love, his Compassions, his Tenderness, which have melted, over∣come and changed my Heart before him. I have met with the Seed's Faith, which hath done and doth that, which the Faith of Man can never do. I have met with the true Birth, with the Birth which is Heir of the King∣dom, and inherits the Kingdom. I have met with the true Spirit of Pray∣er and Supplication, wherein the Lord is prevailed with, and which draws from him whatever the Condition needs, the Soul always looking up to him in the Will, and in the Time and Way which is acceptable with him. What shall I say? I have met with the true Peace, the true Righteousness, the
<PB N="651" REF="003104_0662_0FEFF979B0520E60"/>
true Holiness, the true Rest of the Soul, the everlasting Habitation, which the Redeemed dwell in: And I know all these to be true, in him that is true, and am capable of no Doubt, Dispute or Reasoning in my Mind about them, it abiding there, where it hath received the full Assurance and Sa∣tisfaction. And also I know very well and distinctly in Spirit, where the Doubts and Disputes are, and where the Certainty and full Assurance is, and in the tender Mercy of the Lord am preserved out of the one, and in the other.</P>
<P>Now (the Lord knows) these Things I do not utter in a boasting Way, but would rather be speaking of my Nothingness, my Emptiness, my Weak∣ness, my manifold Infirmities which I feel more than ever. The Lord hath broken the Man's Part in me, and I am a Worm and no Man before him: I have no Strengh to do any Good or Service for him, nay I cannot watch over or preserve my self: I feel daily that I keep not alive my own Soul, but am weaker before Men, yea weaker in my Spirit (as in my self) than ever I have been. But I cannot but utter to the Praise of my God, that I feel his Arm stretched out for me; and my Weakness (which I feel in my self) is not my Loss, but Advantage before him. And these Things I write, as having no End at all therein of my own, but felt it this Morning required of me, and so in Submission and Subjection to my God, have I given up to do it, leaving the Success and Service of it with him.</P>

<P>From this Conclusion we see the Humility of the Mind of this Friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Caution to conceived Wits.</NOTE> who, when he writ this, was already much advanced in the Way of Godliness, and had lived several Years in the Communion of those cal∣led <HI>Quakers.</HI> Now, tho' it be the Duty of every one, not to be con∣ceited of himself, yet certain it is, that Men of refined Wits above all others have need to continue truly humble, and not to rely thereon, since the trusting to Acuteness of Wit hath rather drawn off many from the Way of Truth, than led them to it; nay, it hath occasioned the Fall of some. But that <HI>I. Pennington</HI> endeavoured to continue in true Humility, appears plainly from the Relation above. He was a Man of a very compassionate Temper, and yet valiant in Adversities: He also suffered not a little on the Account of his Religion, but endured many tedious and long Imprisonments, which were the more hard to him, because he being of a weakly Constitution, the Suffering of Cold and Hardship, did him the more Hurt. And yet he never fainted, but con∣tinued stedfast to the End of his Life, which was in the latter Part of the Year 1679, when he departed in a pious Frame of Mind.</P>
<P>By the foregoing Relation it appears evidently that he was very ear∣nestly seeking after the true Way to Salvation, before he attained to a perfect Quietness of Mind; yet in that Time there wanted not such as were helpful to him with good and wholesome Advice; and among these <HI>John Crook</HI> (whose Occurrences make up no small Part of this History) was none of the least. And since there is yet extant a Letter of his to him, wherein he not only spoke very effectually to the in∣ward State of <HI>I. Pennington,</HI> but for his Instruction and Encouragement, gave also an Account of the great Difficulties and Temptations he him∣self had met with, I can't well omit to insert the same here; because from the ingenuous and open-hearted Leters of familiar Friends to one another, we generally may discover very plainly their inward State, and also their outward Qualities.

who are born from above, Heirs of an everlasting Inheritance. Oh! how sweet and pleasant are the Pastures which my Father causeth all his Sheep to feed in; there is Variety of Plenty in his Pastures, Milk for Babes, and strong Meat for them of riper Age, and Wine to refresh those that are ready to faint, even the Wine of the King∣dom, that makes glad the Heart when it is ready to faint, by Rea∣son of the Infirmities: Sure I am, none can be so weary but he takes Care of them, nor none so nigh fainting but he puts his Arm under their Heads, nor none can be so beset with Enemies on every Side, but he will arise and scatter, nor none so heavy laden and big with Young but he takes Notice of them, and gently leads them, and will not leave them behind unto the merciless Wolf, because they are his own, and his Life is the Price of their Redemption, and his Blood of their Ransome; and if they be so young that they cannot go, he carries them in his Arms, and when they can feel nothing stirring af∣ter him, his Bowels yearn after them; so tender is this good Shep∣herd after all his Flock. I can tell, for I was as one that once went astray, and wandered upon the barren Mountains; and when I had wearied my self with Wandering, I went into the Wilderness, and there I was torn as with Briars, and pricked as with Thorns, some∣times thinking this was the Way, and sometimes concluding that was the Way, and by and by concluding all was out of the Way, and then bitter Mourning came upon me, and Weeping for Want of the Interpreter; for when I sought to know what was the Matter, and where I was, it was too hard for me; then I thought I would ven∣ture on some Way where it was most likely to find a lost God, and I would pray with them that prayed, and fast with them that fasted, and mourn with them that mourned, if by any Means I might come to Rest, but found it not, until I came to see the Candle lighted in my own House, and my Heart swept from those Thoughts and Ima∣ginations, and Willings, and Runnings, and to die unto them all, not heeding of them, but watching against them, lest I should let my Mind go a whoring after them; and here I dwelt for a Time as in a desolate Land uninhabited, where I sat alone as a Sparrow upon the House-top, and was hunted up and down like a Partridge upon the Mountains, and could rest no where, but some Lust or Thought or other followed me at the Heels, and disquieted me Night and Day, until I came to know him in whom was Rest, and no Occasion of Stumbling, in whom the Devil hath no Part, and he became unto me as an Hiding-place from the Storms, and from the Tempests. Then came my Eyes to see my Saviour, and my Sorrow to fly away, and he became made unto me all in all, my Wisdom, my Righteousness, and my Sanctification, in whom I was and am compleat, to the Praise of the Riches of his Grace and Goodness that endures forever. There∣fore be not discouraged, O thou tossed as with Tempests, nor dis∣mayed in thy self, because thou seest such mighty Hosts of Enemies rising up against thee and besetting thee on every Side; for none was so beset, and tried and tempted as the true Seed was, who was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief: But be thou still in thy Mind, and let the Billows pass over, and Wave upon Wave, and fret not thy self because of them, neither be cast down, as if it should ne∣ver be otherwise with thee; Sorrow comes at Night, but Joy in the Morning, and the Days of thy Mourning shall be over, and the Accu∣ser will God cast out for ever; for therefore was I afflicted, and not comforted, and tempted and tried for this End, that I might know how to speak a Word in due Season unto those who are tempted and afflicted as I once was; as it was said unto me in that Day when Sor∣row
<PB N="653" REF="003104_0664_0FEFF97CD0BD3F70"/>
lay heavy upon me: Therefore be not disconsolated, neither give Heed unto the Reasonings and Disputings of thy own Heart, nor the Fears that rise therefrom, but be strong in the Faith, believing in the Light which lets thee see them, and his Grace thou wilt know to be sufficient for thee, and his Strength to be made perfect in thy Weakness, and so wilt thou rather glory in thy Infirmities, that his Power may rest upon thee, than in thy earnest Desires to be rid of them; for by these Things thou wilt come to live in the Life of God, and joy in God, and glory in Tribulation, when thou hast learn∣ed in all Conditions to be contented, and thro' Trials and deep Ex∣ercises is the Way to learn this Lesson. These Things in dear Love to thee I have written, being somewhat sensible of thy Condition, and the many Snares thou are daily liable unto, therefore watch that thou fall not into Temptation, and my God and Father keep thee in the Arms of eternal Love, over all, unto the End, unto his Praise. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>John Crook</HI> had been a Man of Note in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther Hint concerning <HI>J. Crook.</HI></NOTE> not only be∣cause he had been a Justice of Peace, as hath been said in due Place, but also because he was a Man of good Intellects, and yet his Zeal for what he believed to be Truth, was such, that he became willing to bear the Reproach of the World, that so he might enjoy Peace with God. But tho' he was a Man of Learning, yet most of the first Preachers of the Doctrine held forth by those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> were People of small Account in the World; but yet they were so Powerful in their Preach∣ing, that many thereby were turned to true Godliness.</P>
<P>Some have been reached by the Sayings of dying Penitents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some convinced by dying Peni¦tents.</NOTE> for there have been remarkable Instances of young People, sprung from honest Parents, who having walked in the broad Way, did very earnestly be∣wail their Out-goings on a dying Bed, and then declared, that if it pleased God to raise them up again, they would not, as before, be ashamed of the despised Way of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> nor fear any Mockings, or Persecution, but that they would serve the Lord in Uprightness, and with all their Heart. These thus repenting with Tears for their Trans∣gressions, have experienced, after great Agonies, that God wills not the Death of Sinners, but that they should repent, and so live in everlasting Happiness.</P>
<P>Of several such like Cases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Warning to young People, against Pride, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the re∣markable Re∣pentance of <HI>S Whitrow</HI></NOTE> I'll only mention one, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a young Maid at <HI>London,</HI> called <HI>Susanna Whitrow,</HI> whose Mother was of the Society of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> but not her Father. On her dying Bed she com∣plained exceedingly of her Rebellion and vain Behaviour: <HI>Ah,</HI> said she to her Mother, <HI>how often hast thou said, The Lord would plead with us? Now the Day is come. Pride and Disobedience were my cursed Fruits, which I brought forth when I was a Hearer in the publick Church. How often have I adorned my self, as fine in their Fashion as I could make me? Yet they despised my Dress, and said to me, How like a Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dry have you dressed your self? You are not at all in the Mode. Then coming Home on the Sabbath-Day, I went immediately up into my Chamber, and locking the Door, I altered all my Lates, and so I went to their Worship in the Afternoon, dressed in their Mode, and then I pleased them.</HI> At another Time she said, <HI>O that I might have a little Time longer to go into the Country, and walk in the Woods to seek the Lord! O what Matter for fine Houses, and silk Apparel! O remember him that sat on the Ground, and wore a Garment without a Seam, our blessed holy Lord, who went up to the Mountains to pray, and withdrew himself into Gardens, and de∣solate Places. I have done nothing for the Lord, but he hath done all for
<PB N="654" REF="003104_0665_0FEFF9C174CAC540"/>
me: Therefore I desire to live, that I might live an holy and righteous Life, that my Conversation might be in Heaven, tho' my Body be here on Earth. How would I then invite and warn others, not to spend their precious Time in adorning themselves like</HI> Jezebel, <HI>patching and painting, and curling their Hair. O the Christian Life is quite another Thing: We must not give our selves the Liberty to think our own Thoughts, much less to act such Abominations.</HI> Several Days she was in a strong Wrest∣ling and Conflict of Spirit, and in fervent Prayer to God, so that when somebody was for removing her Head a little, she refusing it, said, <HI>I would not suffer a Thought to wander; if I move, I shall be drawn off my Watch, and then the Tempter will prevail.</HI> Continuing in this Con∣flict, she conceived at length Hopes of Forgiveness; and being thus strengthned by Mercy, she said to the Lord, <HI>O what can my Soul say of thy Power! When I sought thee but could not find thee; I knocked hard but none did open; for my Sins stood like Mountains, that I could not come near thee: I would fain have prayed to thee but could not. Thus I lay several Days and Nights, struggling for Life, but could find none; and I said, There is no Mercy for me: Then I said, I will never leave thee; if I perish, I will perish here; I will never cease crying unto thee. And then I heard a Voice say,</HI> Jacob wrestled all Night before he ob∣tained the Blessing. <HI>Oh then thy Word, O Lord, was strong to my Soul: Then my stony Heart was broken to Pieces, and the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication was poured upon me. And now I can sing as</HI> David <HI>did, of Mercy and of Judgment: Unto thee, O Lord, will I sing with a rent Heart, and with my Mouth in the Dust will I sing Praises to thee, my blessed Saviour.</HI> In this Frame she endeavoured to continue, and once she pray∣ed for her Father, called <HI>Robert Whitrow,</HI> Part of which Prayer was as followeth. <HI>O Lord, remember not his Offences, let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear them; let it be easy to him; make his Friends to be Enemies to him, that thou mayst have Mercy upon him. His Temptations are great, Lord carry him thro'; O let him not perish with the World; do thou' support him over this World. Shall a little Dirt of this World draw away his Mind? O Lord, let his Mind be set on Things above; fix his Mind upon thee.</HI> Thus fervently this young Maid prayed for her Father, herself now having attained to a full Assurance of her Salvation, so that she once said to the Lord: <HI>O thou Beloved of my Soul, what shall I say of thee! For thou art too won∣derful for me: O Praises be unto thee.</HI> And afterward perceiving that her End was approaching, she said to her Mother, <HI>I must lay down this Body; the Lord will not trust me longer in this present wicked World: Happy am I: My Saviour, my Soul loves thee dearly; thy Love is better than Wine: My Saviour, my Holy One, how glorious art thou! I have seen thy Glory; I am overcome with thy sweet Countenance: O how lovely art thou! My Heart is ravished with the sweet Smiles of thy glorious Countenance. O, come away, come away! Why dost thou stay? I am ready, I am ready.</HI> Then she lay some Time very still, and so departed this Life without Sigh or Groan, which was about the Year 1677.</P>
<P>Such like dying Persons have been the Means sometimes to stir up others to true Godliness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some convinced by beholding the weighty Frame of Friends in their silent As∣semblies.</NOTE> whereby they came to be joined with the People called <HI>Quakers;</HI> and tho' these in Time came to be very nume∣rous, yet at first there were but few Labourers in the Ministry of the Word. But these recommending one another to give diligent Heed to the Word of God in the Heart, and to mind That as their Teacher, did often meet together, and keep Assemblies, sitting down with such a deep Retiredness of Mind, being turned inward to God, that Tears trickled down their Cheeks, to the Astonishment of many that looked upon them, some of which, only by beholding this serious Retiredness, came to be so effectually reach'd, that they also joined with them, and
<PB N="655" REF="003104_0666_0FEFF97E7178E6D8"/>
frequented their Meetings. In the mean while many of these became more and more confirmed in their Minds by this silent Exercise, and their Understandings came to be so opened, that in Process of Time they became apt and fit Instruments to exhort others to Godliness: And among these, several Women also found it their Duty to preach the Gospel.</P>
<P>There have been many who were very averse to the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>C.

<P>The like Instance of an unexpected Conversion was seen also in <HI>William Gibson,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W. Gibson</HI> convinced going to distrub <HI>T. Holms,</HI> &amp;c. at a Meeting.</NOTE> whom I knew well, and who at the Time of the Civil Wars being a Soldier at <HI>Carlisle,</HI> he and three others having heard that a <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting was appointed in that City, they agreed to go thither, and abuse the Preacher, whose Name was <HI>Thomas Holms:</HI> But <HI>Gibson</HI> hear∣ing him powerfully declare the Truth, was so affected by his Testimony, that he step'd in near him, to defend him, if any should have offered to abuse him: And he himself afterwards came to be a zealous Preacher of that Truth he had been at unawares convinced of.</P>
<P>To these Instances I may add that of a certain Trumpeter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And a Trum∣peter much in the like Manner.</NOTE> who com∣ing into a <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting, began in an insolent Manner to sound his Trumpet, thereby to drown the Voice of him that preached: But this had a contrary Effect, and stirred up the Zeal of the Preacher the more, so that he went on as if none disturbed him. The Trumpeter at length to recover his Breath, was fain to cease blowing; but being still govern'd by an evil Spirit, after some Intermission began to sound again: But whatever he did, he was not able to divert the Preacher from his Dis∣course, tho' he hindred the Auditory from hearing what was spoken. Thus he wearied himself so much, that he was forced to rest again for Respiration; whereby, in Spight of his evil Will, he came to hear what the Preacher spoke, which was so piercing, that the Trumpeter came to be deeply affected with it, and bursting out into Tears, con∣fess'd his Crime, and came to be a true Penitent; a remarkable Evidence of the Truth of that Saying of the Apostle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ix. 16.</NOTE> <HI>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Among these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As likewise Justice <HI>Pearson</HI> by <HI>J N.</HI> and <HI>G Fox</HI></NOTE> who contrary to their Intent entred into Communion with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, may be reckoned also <HI>Anthony Pearson,</HI> the Justice, of whom in this History it hath been mentioned that he was so reached by <HI>G. Fox</HI> at <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> that he came to be one of his Fol∣lowers; which tho' true, yet it was before that Time that he was in some Respect convinced of the Doctrine maintained by the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> which happened to be by <HI>James Naylor,</HI> who upon an Indict∣ment of Blasphemy appearing at the Sessions at <HI>Appleby</HI> in the Month called <HI>January,</HI> 1652, found the said Justice <HI>Pearson</HI> sitting there on the Bench, as one of his Persecutors, who asking him several Questions,
<PB N="656" REF="003104_0667_0FEFF9C4AF314898"/>
received such pertinent Answers from <HI>J. Naylor,</HI> that in a great Degree he was convinced of the Truth held by <HI>J. N.</HI> and his Friends.</P>
<P>By what hath been related here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclusion of this Book manifests the Increase of this People, not∣withstanding the Severity and Cruelty of their Adversaries, and at length their being to∣lerated by Law.</NOTE> may be seen how unexpectedly some entred into Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called; more Instances of which might be produced if needful, since I have known such, who being natu∣rally of a boisterous Temper, yet were so struck with the Terror of the Lord, that they came to be of such a quiet Spirit, and harmless Be∣haviour, that as formerly they could not suffer the least Provocation, so now they bore all Revilings and Mockings with an even and undisturbed Mind, because the Fear of God had made such deep Impressions upon them, that they were careful, lest by an angry or impetuous Deport∣ment, they should sin against him. And thus continuing to live in Fear, and a reverential Awe, they improved in true Godliness; insomuch, that by their pious Lives, they preached as well as others with Words. After this Manner the Number of their Society encreased; but then grievous Sufferings ensued; for the Priests could not endure to see that their Hearers left them; the furious Mob were spurred on, and among the Magistrates there were many, who being of a fierce Temper, used all their Strength to root out the Professors of the Light, (as they were called at first) and to suppress and stifle their Doctrine: But all proved in vain, as appears abundantly from this History, altho' there were hardly Prisons in <HI>England,</HI> where some of these People were not shut up, besides the Spoil of Goods, and cruel Whippings that befel some of them. Yet all this they bore with a more than ordinary Courage, without making Resistance, how great soever their Number was, and notwithstanding many of them had been valiant Soldiers, who often had slain their Enemies in the Field, without regarding Danger.</P>
<P>In the Consideration of this undaunted Stedfastness, it hath seemed to me, that there have been some such among this People, whose Ta∣lent was, valiantly to endure Persecution for a good Cause, and who perhaps in Ease would not have been such good Christians, as they proved to be under these Sufferings; resembling the <HI>Cammomil</HI> in this, which the more it is depressed, or rubbed, the better it grows, and yields the stronger Scent. Being then thus oppressed, they found themselves under a Necessity of continuing vigilant and watchful, and according to King <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Advice, to <HI>keep their Heart with all Diligence.</HI> This made them love what they judged to be Truth more than their Lives, and it caused them to be careful, lest that should come over them which the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> was threatened with, because she had left her first Love, <HI>viz.</HI> the Removing of her Candlestick out of its Place. Thus their mutual Love increased, and their own Lives they valued not, when the grieving of their Consciences stood in Competition with it. Having thus pass'd thro' many Adversities, with an unwearied and lasting Pa∣tience, and being become a great People, known by the Name of <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> they were at length, by the generous Clemency of King <HI>William</HI> III. and the Favour of the Parliament, declared to be a Society, who should henceforth be tolerated in the Kingdom as <HI>Protestant Dissenters,</HI> with Liberty to perform their Religious Worship in publick without Dis∣turbance.</P>

His Daughter <HI>Margaret</HI> was religious even in y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r young Years, and was married before she had attained the Age of eighteen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Thomas Fell</HI> of <HI>Swarthmore,</HI> who being bred a Lawyer, be∣came a Justice of Peace, and having afterwards been a Member in several Parliaments, was made Vice-chancellor of the County of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and in Process of Time a Judge, being beloved because of his Justice, Wisdom, Moderation and Mercy.</P>
<P>In the Year 1652, <HI>G. Fox</HI> coming the first Time to his House, when he himself was from home, did by his Exhortations so reach to the Fa∣mily, that a Priest with some Gentlemen went and told Judge <HI>Fell,</HI> that a great Disaster had befaln his Wife and Family, they being seduced and turned <HI>Quakers.</HI> This was so odiously represented to him, that it trou∣bled him not a little: But being come home, and received very kindly by his Wife according to her usual Manner, he soon perceived that it
<PB N="659" REF="003104_0670_0FEFF982B2166340"/>
had been intended to made him believe Untruths, and po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess him with Prejudice. Not long after <HI>G. Fox</HI> got Opportunity to speak to him, which gave him such Satisfaction, that he owned that which was spoken to be Truth; and his Wife ordered a Dinner to be made ready for her Friend <HI>G. Fox,</HI> and those that were with him. And some Time after he told his Wife, when he heard that she and her Friends were consulting where to have a Meeting, that they might meet in his Hall; which they did; and tho' he himself did not come there, yet when a Meeting was kept, he used to sit in a Chair so near to it, that tho' he could not be seen of every Body, yet he could hear what was preached; which he liked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o well, that it is not known, that after he had heard <HI>G. Fox,</HI> he ever frequented the publick Church: Insomuch, that tho' he entred not into full Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet he favoured them, and several Times stop'd the Malice of their Persecutors, when it was in his Power so to do.</P>
<P>After he had been married six and twenty Years, to <HI>Margaret,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Judge Fell</NOTE> and had nine Children by her, he deceased in the Year 1658, leaving behind him a Son and seven Daughters.</P>
<P><HI>Margaret</HI> being thus become a Widow, neglected no Opportunity to serve her Friends. In the Year 1660, when King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was restor'd, (scarce two Weeks after he came in) she went to <HI>London,</HI> and spoke se∣veral Times with that Prince, that he would cause the Sufferings of her Friends to cease; and in Order thereto she writ, not only to him, but also to the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Glocester,</HI> the Queen Mother, the Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> And after having been about fifteen Months at <HI>London,</HI> she at length prevailed with the King, that her Friends who were in Prison were released by Proclamation. But Per∣secution afterwards beginning again, she went to speak with the King and the D
ke of <HI>York</HI> at <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI> In the Year 1664 for refusing to swear, she was confined in <HI>Lancaster-Castle,</HI> and kept long in Durance; for (because of her great Service in the Church) she was much envied as well as <HI>G. Fox,</HI> to whom she was married about eleven Years after the Decease of her first Husband Judge <HI>Fell.</HI> But not long after she was again imprisoned, and continued a Year in Jail, being most Part of that Time sickly; and afterwards was several Times fined for Preaching. In the seventieth Year of her Age she spoke again with the King, which was the last Time; but she was not received so favourably as formerly, for he seemed to be somewhat angry; and therefore she writ to him, and staid at <HI>London</HI> in Hopes of an Answer; but he was suddenly taken away by Death. Afterwards she spoke with King <HI>James,</HI> and writ to him also. And at length, after a laborious and godly Life, she piously departed from hence in a great Age, as hath been said already, having uttered in the Time of her Sickness many excellent Sayings, by which it appeared that she was prepared for Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>She writ</HI> The Call of the Jews out of Babylon, <HI>dedi∣cated to</HI> M. B Israel, <HI>and many other Pieces.</HI></NOTE> and longed to be dissolved. She had been a zealous Preacher, and also written much, and among the rest a Book entitled, <HI>The Call of the Jews out of Babylon,</HI> which she dedicated to the famous <HI>Manasseh Ben Israel,</HI> and charged him, as he would answer it before God, to cause it to be read among his Brethren. This Book being translated by <HI>William Ames</HI> into <HI>Dutch,</HI> was also printed in that Language, whilst her first Husband lived.</P>
<P>The same Year she died,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Keith</HI> sent to preach in <HI>A¦merica,</HI> returns with very little Success, but gets a Benefice of a∣bout <HI>120 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per Annum</HI> in <HI>Sussex.</HI></NOTE> <HI>George Keith,</HI> who now preached up and down where the Bishops thought fit, went by their Order to <HI>New-Eng∣land, New-York, Pennsylvania,</HI> &amp;c. for it seems he imagined that in those Parts he should get many Adherents among the <HI>Quakers:</HI> But he came much short of his Aim; for even in <HI>Pennsilvania,</HI> where many of the <HI>Baptists</HI> formerly sided with him, he was by them look'd upon with Disdain, and rejected for wearing a Clergyman's Gown; and now
<PB N="660" REF="003104_0671_0FEFF9C9A83EB430"/>
appearing to be a great Apostate, there was no Likelihood for him to get Entrance, or to be esteemed there. After some Time being returned into <HI>England,</HI> he got a Living in the Parish of <HI>Edburton</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> worth about 120 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a Year. Now tho' the Episcopalians seemed to be in great Expectation that <HI>Keith</HI> should suppress the Doctrine of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet all his Endeavours proved in vain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Endea∣vours, as well as those of all others, to sup∣press the Doc∣trine of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> vain.</NOTE> for whatever some may think, it is certain, and appears from this History, that they are become a great People after a very singular Manner, and that all Projects and Attempts to root them out, have been quash'd, and come to nought: And from this Consideration it was, as I have Reason to think, that many of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, in their Preaching did found forth these Words, being as it were extorted from <HI>Balaam: There's no Inchant∣ment against</HI> Jacob, <HI>nor Divination against</HI> Israel; as I my self have often heard. And now the Strength and Power of their violent Opposers was broken by the Favour of King <HI>William</HI> III. and his Successor Queen <HI>Anne</HI> hath favourably confirmed the Liberty of Conscience and Wor∣ship, granted by an Act of Parliament to the <HI>Quakers.</HI> So that now we may look upon them as a free People, and a Society tolerated by supreme Authority; and therefore I might now finish this History, as to the Import of the Title.</P>
<P>But before I conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Something as to their Doc∣trine. Concerning the Light.</NOTE> I intend to say something concerning their Doctrine, of which Mention hath been often made in this Work, <HI>viz.</HI> That their chief Principle, in which they differ from the Generality of modern Christian Societies, is, that every Man is enlightned with the Divine Light, according to the Evangelist <HI>John,</HI> who in the first Chapter, speaking of Christ as he was from Eternity with the Father, calls him <HI>the Word,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and saith, That <HI>The Word was God, that all Things were made by him, that in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> And the Evangelist speaking concerning <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, who was sent from God, saith, <HI>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear Witness of that Light: That was the true Light, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> By this it appears, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have not coin'd a new Phrase, but only made use of the express Words of the holy Scripture. I am not unacquainted that, during the great Apostacy, Peo∣ple generally have not clearly understood this; yet it ought not to seem strange, because the Evangelist saith, <HI>The Light shineth in Darkness, and the Darkness comprehended it not.</HI> But to elucidate this Doctrine a little more, it may serve for Information, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> believe this Light to be the same that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> calls <HI>The Grace of God that bring∣eth Salvation, and hath appeared to all Men:</HI> And concerning its Opera∣tion, he saith, <HI>teaching us, that denying Ungodliness, and worldly Lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much briefly concerning the above-mentioned Denominations of this Divine Light; and to make it appear more plainly what this Phrase means, <HI>Take heed to the Light;</HI> thereby we understand, that each one minding the Counsel of the Light in their Souls, may learn to fear God, and hate Pride, Arrogancy, and every evil Way, which will beget in us such a reverential Awe towards God, that we dare not do any Thing which we certainly know will displease him; and this is the first Step to Godliness: And therefore both <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> have said, that <HI>the Fear of God is the Beginning of Wisdom,</HI> viz. that Fear which is filial and accompanied with Circumspection and Cautiousness; and as we persevere in this Fear, <HI>we are enabled to serve the Lord in Holiness and Righteousness all the Days of our Life.</HI></P>
<P>But since we can do this only by the Grace of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayer.</NOTE> 'tis absolutely ne∣cessary that we take heed thereto: And therefore we ought to pray to God continually for his Assistance. But here starts up something, of
<PB N="661" REF="003104_0672_0FEFF987E16FA1A0"/>
which People generally have a wrong Notion: For all Sorts of Chri∣stians agree, that we must often pray to God, but in the manner of it many err greatly. For some think they perform this Duty of praying to God, when in the Mornings and Evenings, and at other certain Times of the Day, they repeat or recite some Forms of Prayer, and don't seem to consider,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xviii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1 Thes. v. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Eph. vi. 18</NOTE> <HI>That Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> exhorts to <HI>pray without ceasing.</HI> And what this means, he himself explains in these Words, <HI>Praying always with all Prayer and Sup∣plication in the Spirit,</HI> which plainly shews, that it consists not in a conti∣nual repeating of Prayers, but in pious and devout Breathings to God, raised in the Soul by the Spirit of Christ, that it may please him to keep us continually in his Fear and Counsel, since we are in want of daily Support from him. And thus praying in Faith, we receive an An∣swer to our Breathings in some Measure, tho' not always so soon as we desire: But we must not faint; and our Prayer must be from a sincere believing and breathing of the Heart; otherwise we pray amiss, and do not receive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James iv. 3.</NOTE> according to the Saying of the Apostle <HI>James, Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss.</HI> But what Devices and Wiles have not been invented by the Enemy of Man's Soul, to keep him off from this continual State of Prayer!<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxvi. 41.</NOTE> Altho' Christ very expresly saith, <HI>Watch and pray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark xiii. 37</NOTE> that ye enter not into Temptation.</HI> And, <HI>What I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.</HI> Which in regard to the Instruction we may reap thence, doth not imply a continual Watching without sleeping, but a Vigilancy of the Mind, which <HI>Solomon</HI> recommends in these Words, <HI>Keep thy Heart with all Diligence.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. iv. 23</NOTE> Now tho' our Constitution doth not seem to admit an incessant Continuance in the deepest Retiredness of Mind, yet this is certain, that the more fervently we turn our Minds to God, the more we are kept from Evil. And Man persevering in this godly Excrcise, is the less in Danger of falling into spiritual Pride; since he finds that his Preservation is in true Humility, and in a continual Dependance upon God: For if he once departs from thence, and thinks himself safe enough, and that now he needs not to walk circumspectly in Fear as he once did, then he is caught already, and somewhat gone astray from his Spiritual Guide, to wit, from that which shewed unto him his Transgressions, and troubled him whilst he was in the evil Way. And this is <HI>the Manifestation of the Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> which the Apostle saith, <HI>is given to every Man to profit withal.</HI> Now to call this Principle which reproves Men for Evil, and consequently discovers it, <HI>Light,</HI> doth not carry with it any Absurdity; especially if we consider that this Deno∣mination is found in Sacred Writ. Evil Deeds are called by the Apostle the <HI>Works of Darkness;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. v. 11</NOTE> and saith he, <HI>All Things that are reproved, are made manifest by the Light: For whatsoever doth make manifest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph v 13</NOTE> is Light.</HI> By which it appears plainly, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have not coin'd a new Phrase, but only followed the Scripture-Language. And that they are not the only People that have declared of the Light, might be proved from other Authors of good Esteem, if Necessity required.</P>
<P>As to Oaths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oaths</NOTE> they judge the taking of an Oath unlawful, and why, may abundantly be seen in this History from a Multitude of Instances.</P>
<P>The making of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wars</NOTE> they also believe to be inconsistent with pure Christianity, and esteem that its Followers being led by its Precepts, will come <HI>to beat their Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-books,</HI> and not to learn War any more. According to the Pre∣diction of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> ii. 4. and Christ the <HI>Author of our Faith,</HI> unto whom we are commanded, <HI>to look,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John xviii <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> saith expresly, <HI>My Kingdom is not of this World: If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Ser∣vants fight;</HI> And the Apostle <HI>James</HI> iv. giveth us to understand, that <HI>Wars and Fightings come of Lusts.</HI> And we believe, that by receiv∣ing

And therefore they judge it not lawful for them to make War, and for all That they think that they may very safely be tolerated by the Civil Goverment, not only because they are willing and ready to pay Taxes to <HI>Caesar,</HI> but also that since they can't fight for the Government, neither can they fight against it.</P>
<P>Concerning the Sword of Magistracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magistracy.</NOTE> they do in no wise assert, that it is unlawful for some Christians to be Magistrates: For to say so, what doth it imply but the Unchristianing of Magistrates, whom they truly honour; Magistracy being the Ordinance of God. But altho' they be∣lieve this Office to be consistent with Christian Religion, yet they think it more safe for themselves not to seek for it.</P>
<P>Tithes to the Priests they do not look upon as a Gospel-Maintenance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tithes.</NOTE> since our Saviour said in express Terms to his Disciples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. x. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give;</HI> yet they don't stretch this so far, as not to suffer that any who hath imparted of his Spiritual Gifts to others, might not receive Temporal Gifts of them, if he himself was in want thereof, provided the maintenance of a Minister of the Gospel be free, and not forced; and also that it consists not in a fix'd Stipend, which leads to turn the Ministry of the Gospel into a Provision of a Livelihood: which they look upon to be far beneath the Dignity of the Ministerial Office, which ought to be performed purely out of Love to God and our Neighbour, and not with any Regard to secular Gain.</P>
<P>The ordinary Way of shewing Respect or Honour in common Con∣versation is also what they scruple: For to give the same outward Sign of Respect to Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salutations and Greetings.</NOTE> which is given to God, <HI>viz.</HI> the Uncovering of the Head, they think (not without good Reason) to be unfit; and so they esteem also the giving flattering Titles of Honour, since Christ so sharp∣ly reproves <HI>the Greetings in the Markets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 8.</NOTE> and the being called of Men <HI>Rabbi, Rabbi,</HI> saying, <HI>Be not ye called Rabbi;</HI> which Title of that Time may be equalled with the modern <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Sir.</HI> Thus Christ saith also, <HI>How can ye believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John v 44.</NOTE> who receive Honour of one another?</HI> Yet they limit this only to common Conversation with ones Equals: For a Servant may call his Master by that Title, and Subjects their Magistrates by the Title of their Office, and this may be spoken not contrary to Truth; whereas the other is nothing but meer Flattery, invented to gratifie and cherish Pride; and therefore they think it inconsistent with the true Gravity of a Christian to call one's self a <HI>Servant</HI> of one who has not any Mastership over us; and they believe we can't be too cautious in speaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xii. 36.</NOTE> since our Saviour saith, <HI>That every idle Word that Men shall speak, they shall give Account thereof in the Day of Judgment.</HI> The common Fashion of Greeting they also decline, thinking it more safe not to imitate the ordinary Custom therein. But that it is more agreeable with Christian Simplicity to greet one another by giving their Hand, or by other innocent and harmless Notice in passing by, which are Signs of Friendship and Respect, that may be shewed, without giving to Man that which appertains to God, as the uncovering of the Head is among Christians: For the uncovering of the Head is an outward Sign of the Worship and Honour that is paid to God: And if we give the same To∣ken also to Men, it may be queried, wherein the Difference consists? If it be answered, that it consisteth in the Meaning and Intention, then Use is made of the same Argument, whereby Papists endeavour to excuse their Adoration of Images and Relicks.</P>

<P>In their Method or Marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage</NOTE> they also depart from the common Way; for in the Old Testament they find not that the Joyning of a Couple in Marriage ever was the Office of a Priest, nor in the Gospel, any Preacher among Christians appointed thereto. Therefore it is their Custom, that when any intend to enter into Marriage, they first having the Consent of Parents or Guardians, acquaint the respective Mens and Womens Meetings of their Intention, and after due Enquiry, all Things appearing clear, they in a publick Meeting solemnly take each other in Marriage, with a Promise of Love and Fidelity, and not to leave one another before Death separates them. Of this a Certificate is drawn, mentioning the Names and Distinctions of the Persons thus joined, which being first signed by themselves, those then that are present sign as Witnesses.</P>
<P>In the burying of their Dead they mind Decency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burial of the Dead.</NOTE> and endeavour to avoid all Pomp; and the wearing of Mourning is not approved among them; for they think that the Mourning which is lawful, may be shew∣ed sufficiently to the World by a modest and grave Deportment.</P>
<P>As to Water-Baptism and the outward Supper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-Bap¦tism.</NOTE> tho' they don't use the external Signs, (witnessing Christ the Substance to be come) yet they are not for judging others who do use them conscienciously and devout∣ly.

Whence it evidently appears that Baptism did not come in the Place of Cir∣cumcision, as it hath been often urged to persuade the Ignorant. But as a Jewess Proselyte needed not to get the Child she brought forth baptized, since the <HI>Jews</HI> did not baptize their Children, but administred Baptism only to such of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that came over to them, so we do not find the least Evidence that the primitive Chris
ians in the Time of the Apostles did baptize their Issue, that so they might claim to be Members of the Church; but the contrary seems rather to appear from what the Apostle saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. vii 14</NOTE> <HI>The unbelieving Husband is sanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the Husband; else were your Children unclean; but now are they holy:</HI> Which implieth no more, but that such Children, whose Father or Mother alone was a Believer, were not excluded from, but comprehended in the outward Member∣ship: For this can't have any Relation to that Sanctification, whereby the Mind comes to be cleansed: But in Regard of being Partaker, of the outward Fellowship, this reached so far, that if but one of the Pa∣rents, either Father or Mother, was a Believer, the Child thereby be∣came entitled to the outward Society. For to make one a true and real Member of the Church of God, the Baptism of the Spirit was requi∣red, as the main Thing; which made <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, speaking of Christ, say, <HI>He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> signifieth, that <HI>Baptism, which now saves us, is not the putting

away of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lth of the Flesh, but the Answer of a good Conscience to∣wards God.</HI> This was that Baptism of which God by the Prophet <HI>Eze∣kiel</HI> said concerning <HI>Israel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. xxxvi. 24, 25.</NOTE> I will take you from among the Heathen, and gather you out of all Countries. Then will I sprinkle clean Water upon you; and ye shall be clean from all your Filthiness,</HI> &amp;c. It is a common Objection, that Christ himself was baptized with Water, and that we are required to follow his Footsteps: But let it be considered that he was circumcised also, tho' the one as well as the other needed not to his Melioration, but was done for our sake, to shew us by the latter, that our Hearts must be circumcised, that is, separated from all evil Incli∣nations and Lusts. And by the Baptism which he suffered to be ad∣ministred to him, is signified to us, that we must be baptized by his Spiritual Baptism. And if it be objected, that Christ said to <HI>Nicodemus, Except a Man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> It may be answered, that if this must be under¦stood of outward Water, the Consequence will be, that Water-Baptism is of such an absolute Necessity, that if any be deprived of it, he is to be shut out of Heaven, which, tho' believed by Papists, yet I think Pro∣testants will hardly say so; neither was <HI>John Calvin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Calvin. Epist. 184. &amp; 229.</NOTE> of that Opinion. It is also worth taking notice, that <HI>John</HI> the Baptist said, that Christ should baptize <HI>with Fire;</HI> by which it appears, that both <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> in this Sense are metaphorical Expressions: For they both serve for cleansing and purifying, tho' in a different Way. Now altho' some did baptize with Water, yet it ought to be considered, that if the Com∣mand of Christ to his Disciples, <HI>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost,</HI> related absolutely to Water-Baptism, it would indeed have been very strange, that <HI>Paul</HI> that eminent Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> did not think himself commissionated for the Administration of that Baptism. Where∣as, if the Apostles had really received a Commission from the Lord to that Purpose, he by no Means would have been singled out; since speaking of himself he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. xi. 5.</NOTE> that <HI>he supposed he was not a whit behind the very chiefest Apostles;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 17. v. 14.</NOTE> and yet he also saith in express Terms, <HI>Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel.</HI> And, <HI>I thank God that I baptized none of you but</HI> Crispus <HI>and</HI> Gaius. <HI>And I baptized also the Houshold of</HI> Stephanas: <HI>Besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</HI> And yet he saith, <HI>There is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism,</HI> which was the Baptism of the Spirit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 16.</NOTE> And the same Apostle saith also, <HI>As many as have been baptized into Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. iv. 5.</NOTE> <HI>have put on Christ:</HI> And this cannot have Relation to Water-Baptism,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. iii. 27.</NOTE> because many receive that, who ne∣ver put on Christ, and become conformable to his Image, which how∣ever is required of all Christians. To his may be added, that if the Command to baptize, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii. 19. were literally restricted to Wa∣ter-Baptism, then why may not our Saviour's Words be as well un∣derstood literally concerning the washing his Disciples Feet, when he said to <HI>Peters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xiii. 8, 14.</NOTE> If I wash thee not, thou hast no Part with me;</HI> and to his Dis∣ciples, <HI>If I then your Lord and Master have washed your Feet, ye also oug
t to wash one anothers Feet.</HI> More might be said on this Subject; but since <HI>R. Barclay</HI> hath treated of this Matter at large long ago, the Reader may apply to his <HI>Apology for the true Christian Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>outward Supper</HI> it may be truly said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The outward Supper.</NOTE> that it was the Passover that was kept by Christ at the eating of the Paschal Lamb, which likewise was a Judaical Ceremony, that Christians generally take to be a Figure or Shadow. But is not the modern Use of the out∣ward
<PB N="665" REF="003104_0676_0FEFF98C70FC8700"/>
Supper in Remembrance of Christ's Sufferings, also a Figure, <HI>viz.</HI> of his Spiritual Supper with the Soul; and doth it not seem absurd, that one Figure should be the Antitype of the other. The Passover was not a Memorial of another Sign that was to follow; but it was a Me∣morial of the slaying of all the First-born in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and of the Preser∣vation of <HI>Israel</HI> and their First-born. Moreover it may be said, that the Paschal Lamb was eaten in their Families, whereas the outward Supper now is celebrated in publick Places for Worship. We find, that the Apostles <HI>breaking Bread from House to House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts ii 46</NOTE> did eat their Meat with Gladness and Singleness of Heart;</HI> which implies an usual Meal or Eating. And certainly they do well who daily at Meals remember Christ and his Sufferings: For the Spiritual Supper, which is the Thing required, ought to be partaken of by every true Christian; and this can't be, unless we being attentive, open the Door of our Hearts to Christ and let him come in. Let it also be considered, that the Soul wants daily Food as well as the Body; and being destitute of that, will faint and languish, and so become unable to do Good; and therefore our Lord recommended his Disciples to pray for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signifying, according to the nice Explanation of <HI>Paser,</HI> Bread to maintain or uphold the Essence or Substance; tho' others have translated it <HI>Superessential Bread</HI></NOTE> <HI>daily Bread.</HI> For that this chiefly had Relation to the Spiritual Manna, the Bread that comes down from Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John vi 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> appears from this Saying of Christ, <HI>Labour not for the Meat which perisheth, but for that Meat which endureth unto ever∣lasting Life.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom xiv. 17</NOTE> Besides, the Apostle tells us, that <HI>the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink; but Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb xiii <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> And the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> saith, <HI>It is a good Thing that the Heart be established with Grace, not with Meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</HI> All this then being duly consider'd by those called <HI>Quakers,</HI> it hath restrained them from the Use of those Ceremonies. For the Man who thro' Grace is become truly spiritual, hath no need of Ceremonies or outward Means to depend upon, but finds himself excited to rely on the inward Divine Grace, and to de∣pend upon God alone, walking continually in reverential Watchful∣ness before him, and so keeping to the immediate Teachings of Christ in his Heart, he approaches with Boldness to the Throne of Grace, and with a full Assurance of Faith becomes a Partaker of Salvation.</P>
<P>But I leave this Matter to say something also concerning the Way of Worship of the People called <HI>Quakers.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Way of Wor¦ship.</NOTE> It is usual among them, when they meet together in their Religious Assemblies, to spend some Time in a devout Silence and Retiredness of Mind, inwardly praying with pure Breathings to God, which they generally call <HI>Waiting upon the Lord:</HI> And if, under this Spiritual Exercise, any one feels himself stirred up of God, to speak something by Way of Doctrine or Exhor∣tation, he doth so, and sometimes more than one, but orderly, one after another. And that this was usual in the Primitive Apostolical Church, appears from what <HI>Paul</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xiv 3</NOTE> <HI>If any Thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his Peace: For ye may all prophesy one by one.</HI> And what <HI>Prophesying</HI> signifieth under the New Covenant, the Apostle himself explains with these Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor xiv 4</NOTE> <HI>He that prophesyeth, edifieth the Church.</HI> Yet let none think this Liberty of Speaking to be so unlimited, that every Body that can say something, may freely do so in the Con∣gregation: For he that will speak there, must also by all Means be of a good, and honest, and holy Life, and found in Doctrine; and if in Pro∣cess of Time he finds in himself a Concern from the Lord to travel in the Ministry, and desires a Certificate of his Soundness in Doctrine and
<PB N="666" REF="003104_0677_0FEFF9D1B7F2FF80"/>
orderly Life, he may have it from the Congregation where he resides. And certainly a Preacher himself ought to have Experience of the Work of Sanctification, before he is qualified to instruct others in the Way thereto: For meer Brain-Knowledge can't do that effectually. Some∣times in their Meetings there is a publick Prayer before Preaching; and Preaching is generally concluded with a Prayer.</P>
<P>Now Preaching among them is not confined to the Male Sex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Womens Prea∣ching.</NOTE> as a∣mong others: For they believe that Women whom the Lord hath gift∣ed for Gospel-Ministry, may exercise their Gifts among them to Edifi∣cation: For who will presume to say to him, <HI>What dost thou?</HI> To him namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes. v. 19 1 Cor. xiv. 34.</NOTE> who by his Apostle hath said, <HI>Quench not the Spirit.</HI> They are not ignorant that the same Apostle said to the <HI>Corinthians, Let your Women keep Silence in the Churches.</HI> Now not to insist on the Word <HI>your,</HI> which seems to carry an Emphasis along with it, as being chiefly applicable to those <HI>Corinthian</HI> Women, yet by what follows, it appears plainly, that it regards ignorant Women, since it is said there, <HI>If they will learn any thing,</HI> that is, if they will be farther instructed concerning some Points of Doctrine, <HI>Let them ask their Husbands at Home.</HI> Where∣by it appears that this Saying hath Relation to such Women, who ei∣ther from Indiscretion or Curiosity, or out of a Desire to be look'd upon as such that knew also to say something, proposed Questions to the Church, and thereby caused more Confusion than Edification: <HI>For it is</HI> indeed <HI>a Shame for</HI> such <HI>Women to speak in the Church;</HI> and the Apostle's Precept is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 40.</NOTE> <HI>Let all Things be done decently and in Order.</HI> More∣over, it ought to be considered also, that these Words, <HI>Let your Women keep Silence,</HI> have a Tendency also to the Subjection which Women owe to their Husbands, because it is said there also that Women are com∣manded <HI>to be under Obedience.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 34.</NOTE> This the Apostle explains farther in one of his Epistles to <HI>Timothy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. ii. 11, 12.</NOTE> where he saith, <HI>Let the Woman learn in Silence with all Subjection: But I suffer not a Woman to teach, nor to usurp Authority over the Man.</HI> Now that the Apostle doth not ab∣solutely forbid Women speaking to Edification in tne Church, appears from his own Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xi. 5.</NOTE> when he saith, <HI>Every Woman that prayeth or pro∣phesyeth with her Head uncovered, dishonoureth her Head:</HI> For here he gives to Women a Prescript how to behave themselves when they prophesy; and what he means by <HI>Prophesying</HI> he himself declareth in the same Epistle, as hath been hinted already,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xiv. 3, 4.</NOTE> where he saith, <HI>He that prophesyeth, speaketh unto Men to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort;</HI> and <HI>he that prophesyeth edifieth the Church.</HI> And pray what's this but that which we now a-days call <HI>Preaching?</HI> For tho' Prophesying under the old Co∣venant seemeth chiefly to signify a Prediction of what is to come, yet it is credible that the ancient Prophets were also Preachers; and ac∣cording to the New Testament Language it is evident that <HI>Prophesying</HI> is chiefly <HI>Preaching.</HI> Hence we may easily understand what kind of Virgins the four Daughters of <HI>Philip</HI> were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts xxi. 9. Rom. vi.</NOTE> <HI>which did prophesy,</HI> and what kind of <HI>Servant of the Church Phoebe</HI> was, and <HI>Tryphena,</HI> and <HI>Try∣phosa, who laboured in the Lord, and Persis, which laboured much in the Lord,</HI> which is considerably more than what is said of that <HI>Mary, who bestowed much Labour on the Apostles.</HI> How significantly doth the Apostle call <HI>Priscilla</HI> and <HI>Aquila,</HI> his <HI>Helpers in Christ Jesus.</HI> And what he means by <HI>his Helpers</HI> in that Sense, we may see <HI>Philip.</HI> iv. 3. where he speaks of <HI>Women which laboured with him in the Gospel.</HI> All this then being duly considered, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, think it unlawful to for
id such Women to preach, whom the Lord hath gifted, and who are of a godly Life and Conversation, since it appears sufficiently that in the pri∣mive Church they were not debarred from that Service. And as in those Days, so in ours, it hath evidently appeared, that some pious
<PB N="667" REF="003104_0678_0FEFF98F1E346430"/>
Women have had a very excellent Gift to the Edification of the Church. All which tends to the Glory of God, who is no Respecter of Persons, and is pleased to make use of weak Instruments to shew forth his Praise.</P>
<P>As to singing the Words of <HI>David,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Singing in the Churches</NOTE> since they do not suit the State and Condition of mixt Assemblies, they difuse the customary formal Way of singing in the Churches, which has neither Precept nor Prece∣dent in the New Testament.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Resurrection,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Resurrec∣tion.</NOTE> their Belief is orthodox, and agreeable with the Testimonies of the Holy Scriptures: But because they judge it to be very improper to say that we shall rise again with the same numerical Bodies we now have, their Opposers have often falsly ac∣cused them, as such who deny the Resurrection, tho' they fully believe this Saying of the Apostle,<HI>If in this Life only we have Hope in Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 19</NOTE> we are of all Men most miserable.</HI> And as to the Qualities of the Bodies wherewith we shall arise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 44.

For</HI> saith the same Apostle, <HI>our Conversation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile Body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glo∣rious Body, according to the Working whereby he is able to subdue all Things unto himself.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor. xv. 51.</NOTE> And he saith also in express Words, <HI>We shall all be changed.</HI> And therefore they have counted it more safe not to de∣termine with what kind of Bodies we shall be raised, provided we have a firm Belief that there is to be a Resurrection of the Dead: For from such a Determination many Difficulties may arise, which otherwise are avoided; and therefore they have also said to their Antagonists, <Q>Christ's Resurrection is indeed an Argument for our Resurrection; but would it be valid from thence thus to argue: <HI>Because Christ's Body, which was without Sin, and was not corrupted in the Grave, was raised the same it was buried, therefore our Bodies which admit of Corruption, must also be raised the same they are buried?</HI> Nay, by insisting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ifly on this Point, we fall into many Difficulties. Who will venture to say, that when People die, and are buried about the Age of ninety Years, their Bodies in the Resurrection shall be the same decrepit Bo∣dies they were when buried; and that unborn Children dying, shall be raised with such small Bodies they had then?</Q> To shun therefore such kind of Absurdities, they think it better, not to suffer human Wit to ex∣patiate too far, since the Apostle saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. xii. 16 ver. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Mind not high Things;</HI> and adviseth every Man, <HI>not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think.</HI></P>
<P>Now as to Church-Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Churh-Go∣vernment</NOTE> both for looking to the orderly Con∣versation of the Members, and for taking Care of the Poor, and of indi∣gent Widows and Orphans, and also for making Enquiry into Marriages solemnized among them, they have particular Meetings either Weekly, or every two Weeks, or Monthly, according to the Greatness of the Churches. They have also Quarterly Meetings in every County, where Matters are brought that cannot well be adjusted in the particular Meet∣ings. To these Meetings come not only the Ministers and Elders, but also other Members, that are known to be of sober Conversation; and what is agreed upon there, is entred into a Book belonging to the Meet∣ing.

from that Meeting is sent a general Epistle in all the Churches, which commonly is printed; and sometimes particular Epistles are sent also to the respective Churches. By which it may be known every Year, in what Condition the Churches are; and in the said Epistle generally is recommended a godly Life and Conversation, and due Care about the Education of Children.

Fox</HI> convinced of that Truth he preached; and in the next Year they began to preach that Doctrine to others; for which in the following Year she was committed to Prison in the Town of <HI>Auk∣land</HI> in the County of <HI>Durham,</HI> where she had Opportunity to speak to th
People thro' the Window, which she did so pathetically, that se∣veral were affected with her Testimony; and after being released, she travelled up and down the Country, and had good Service; but not long after she was again committed to Prison on an Accusation of having spo∣ken Blasphemy, for which she was tried at <HI>Banbury</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire;</HI> the Indictment drawn up against her containing that she had said, <HI>God did not live:</HI> Whereas that which she said was, <HI>that true Words might be a Lie in the Mouth of some that spoke them,</HI> alledging for Truth the Say∣ing of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> v. 2. <HI>Tho' they say the Lord liveth, sure they swear falsly.</HI> The Judge before whom she appeared, behaved him∣self moderately, and observing how wisely she answered to his Questi∣ons with a modest Boldness, proposed the Matter to the Jury thus; <HI>That she acknowledged the Lord her God and Redeemer to live, and that there were Gods of the Heathen that were dead Gods.</HI> Some of the Justices upon the Bench, who sought her Destruction, perceiving they should not obtain their End, (for it had been divulged that she should be burnt) went off to influence the Jury, and byass them; which had this Effect, that they brought her in guilty of <HI>Misdemeanour;</HI> which made one perfect say, <HI>It was illegal to indict her for one Fact, and to bring her in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of another; since they ought to have found her either guilty or not guilty upon the Matter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> charged in the Indictment.</HI> The Judge, tho' he had carried himself discreetly, had a Mind however somewhat
<PB N="669" REF="003104_0680_0FEFF99152B7BF80"/>
to please the Justices that were her Enemies; and therefore at her Refusal to give Bond for her good Behaviour, she was sent to Prison again; tho' he was heard to say, that <HI>she ought to have been discharged.</HI> And the Prison whither she was sent was a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty Place, several Steps under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; on the Side whereof was a common Sewer, which sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very much, and Frogs and Toads crawl'd in the Room. Here she was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about eight Months; but shewed herself content, be∣ing persuade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that it was for the Lord's Sake she thus suffered. Her Husband <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dland</HI> died, as hath been said before, about the Be∣ginning of the Year at 1664, and two Years after she was married to <HI>Tho∣mas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> a Minister also of the Gospel. She lived very retiredly, and spent much Time in Solitariness, and was almost daily exercised in reading the Holy Scriptures and other edifying Books. Her Husband suffered Imprisonment three Years at <HI>Kendal,</HI> and about six Years at <HI>Appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by;</HI> insomuch that she came to be well acquainted with Adversi∣ties: But by all these she was the more spurr'd on to advance in true Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>; and was a very remarkable Teacher in the Church, having an extraordinary Gift to declare the Truth. And yet she was very modest and humble, insomuch that how full soever she was of Matter, she rare∣ly appeared to preach in large Meetings, where she knew there were Men qualified for that Service; and she was grieved when she perceived any of her Sex to be too forward on such Occasions; and therefore she advised them to be cautious, tho' she did not omit to encourage the Good in all, and endeavoured not to quench the Spirit in any. Thus she continued in a vertuous Life to the End of her Days. At <HI>Bristol</HI> she once fell so sick, that it was thought she was nigh Death; and then she exhorted those that stood by, <HI>to prize their Time, and to prepare for their latter End, as God,</HI> said she, <HI>hath inclined me to do, so that I enjoy unspeakable Peace here, with full Assurance of eternal Rest and Felicity in the World to come.</HI> But she recovered from this Sickness; and when her dying Hour came, which was in her Dwelling-place near <HI>Kendal,</HI> she was not less prepared, but said, <HI>I bless the Lord I am prepared for my Change. I am full of Assurance of eternal Salvation, and a Crown of Glory, thro' my Dear Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> Many other ex∣cellent Sayings she utter'd during the Time of her Sickness; and when she drew near her End, some of her Friends asking her, <HI>Whether she knew them. Yes,</HI> said she, <HI>I know you every one. I have my Understand∣ing as clear as ever: For how should it be otherwise, since my Peace is made with God thro' the Lord Jesus Christ. I have no Disturbance in Mind, therefore is my Understanding and Judgment so good and clear; but to lie under Affliction of Body and Mind, to feel pinching Pangs of Body even to Death, and to want Peace with God; O that would be intol∣lerable to bear!</HI> She advised her Husband to quit himself of the Cumber of the Things of this World, after her Death, that he might with the more Freedom attend the Ministry of the Gospel; and said she, <HI>Warn all, but especially the Rich, to keep Love, and not to be high-minded: For Humility and Holiness is the Badge of our Profession.</HI> A little before her Departure, some fainting Fits taking her, she revived again, and said, <HI>I was glad, thinking I was going to my eternal Rest, without Disturbance. I have both a Sight and Earnest of eternal Rest with God in the World to come.</HI> A little after she said, <HI>Methinks I grow weak and cold. My Hands and Feet are grown very cold, yet my Heart is very strong. I must meet with sharper Pangs than I have yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.—This Pain is hard to Flesh and Blood, but must be endured a little Time; Ease and eternal Rest is at hand; I am glad I see Death so near me.</HI> A little after, seeing her Friends weep, she said, <HI>Be not concerned, for all is well: I have only Death to en∣counter, and the Sting of it is wholly taken away: The Grave hath no Vic∣tory,
<PB N="670" REF="003104_0681_0FEFF9D5EEE639C0"/>
and my Soul is ascending above all Sorow and Pains. So let me go freely to my heavenly Mansion, disturb me not in my Passage. My Friends, go to the Meeting; let me not hinder the Lord's Business, But let it be the chief, and by you all done faithfully, that at the End ye may receive your Reward: For wine is sure. I have not been negligent, my Days-work is done.</HI> Feeling afterwards her Pains encreasing, she prayed the Lord to help her thro' the Agony of Death; and a little after she said, <HI>O my God, O my God, thou hast not forsaken me, blessed be thy Name for ever. O my blessed Saviour, that suffered for me and all Mankind, great Pains in thy holy Body upon the Cross, remember me thy poor Handmaid in this my great bodily Afflict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> My Trust is in thee, My Hope is only in thee, my dear Lord. O come, come dear Lord Jesus, come quickly, re∣ceive my Soul to thee, I yield it up, help me now in my bitter Pangs.</HI> Then her Husband prayed to God, that he would be pleased to make her Passage easie. And she had no more such Pangs, but drew her Breath shorter by Degrees, and said little more, but <HI>that it was good to leave all to the Lord.</HI> And so she slept in the Lord the 30th of <HI>November,</HI> 1705, in the 79th Year of her Age. Thus <HI>Anne C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI> departed this Life, and her Husband said afterwards, that he counted it a great Bles∣sing to have had her to Wife: For she was indeed a very excellent Wo∣man, and therefore I have described her latter End thus circumstantially.</P>
<P>Having now related what hath come to my Knowledge, that I thought remarkable, and of singular Moment in Respect of the Rise and Progress of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> I think what I have written may suffice, and answer the Contents of the Title of this History; and therefore I'll add only a few Occurrences, and then come to a Conclusion.</P>
<P>Many Years ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Union of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> ac∣complished.</NOTE> even in the Time of King <HI>James</HI> I. Endeavours were used to unite <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> into one Kingdom, but all in vain; King <HI>William</HI> III. also tried what could be done in this Case, but his Life did not permit him to bring the Work to Perfection. Yet at length the Matter was agreed and settled about the Beginning of the Year 1707, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> it being concluded that these two Kingdoms henceforth should be united into one, and be called <HI>Great Britain.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1708</NOTE> In the Forepart of the Year 1708, <HI>Scotland</HI> was threatned with an Invasion by the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Attempt to invade <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></NOTE> but he failed in the Attempt, and his Design came to nought. Now since the Union of the said Kingdom with that of <HI>England</HI> was accomplished, and the Succes∣sion of the Crown in the Protestant Line established by Law, the Queen on that Account was congratulated by a Multitude of Addresses of her Subjects; and the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, judged themselves obliged also to testify their Affection to that Princess, as they did by the following Address.</P>

<P>This Address was signed in the Name of the Meeting by fourteen Members thereof, who also were ordered to present it; but it being understood that the Queen seemed willing to be attended with it in private, only seven, among whom were <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> and <HI>Tho. Lower,</HI> went in with it, and were introduced by the Principal Secretary of State — Boyle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.White∣head <HI>speaks to the Queen</HI></NOTE> and <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> presenting it, said, <HI>We heartily wish the Queen Health and Happiness: We are come to present an Address from our Yearly Meeting, which we could have desir'd might have been more early and seasonably timed, but could not, because our said Meet∣ing was but the last Week; and therefore now hope the Queen will favour∣ably accept our Address.</HI> Then <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> delivering it, the Queen said; <HI>Pray read it:</HI> Whereupon he took and read it, and the Queen an∣swered,</P>
<Q><P><HI>I thank you very kindly for your Address,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Answer.</NOTE> and I assure you of my Protection; you may depend upon it.</HI></P></Q>
<P>To which <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> replied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G.

Which Liberty being grounded upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the late King's Reign,</HI> for the uniting the Protestant Sub∣jects in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rest and Affection, <HI>the Union of</HI> Great Britain <HI>now settled tends to the Strength and Safety thereof: For in Union is the Strength and Sta∣bility of a Nation, or Kingdom; and without Union no Nation or People can be safe, but are weak and unstable.

<P><HI>And now, O Queen, that the Lord may preserve and defend Thee for the future, the Remainder of thy Days, and support Thee under all Thy great Care and Concern for the Safely and Good of this Nation and King∣dom of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>and that the Lord may bless and preserve Thee to the End, is our sincere Desire.</HI></P>
<P>To this the Queen returned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With the Queen's Re¦turn</NOTE> <HI>I thank you for your Speech, and for your Address; and ye may be assured I will take care to protect you.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> replied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And <HI>G. Whitehead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Reply</NOTE> <HI>The Lord bless and prosper the Queen in all her good Intentions.</HI> And thereupon he and his Friends withdrew.</P>
<P>The most remarkable Occurrences the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> now met with, were, that they enjoying the Liberty to perform their Religious Worship publickly without Disturbance, were afterward encounter'd by the Writings of their Enemies from Ignorance or Envy, and represented as Maintainers of Heterodox Sentiments; but they not sailing of An∣swers, the Eyes of many were opened, and some came over to them. And tho' sometimes those of the publick Church, and the Success to draw over one that was born and educated among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> but
<PB N="672" REF="003104_0683_0FEFF9D91AA1DB18"/>
inclined to more Liberty, and to be esteemed by the World; yet there have been others of the Episcopal Church, who not from any earthly Consideration, but meerly by a Convincement of their Mind, have en∣ter'd into Society with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> not scaring to make publick Pro∣fession of their Religion, as may appear by two Letters which I'll in∣sert here; the one of <HI>Samuel Crisp,</HI> a Clergyman of the Episcopal Church, who gave the following Account of his Change to one of his Relations.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received a Letter from thee the Week before last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter of <HI>S. Crisp,</HI> a Cler∣gyman, turn'd <HI>Quaker.</HI></NOTE> which was sent by thy Uncle <HI>Bolton:</HI> There were a great many kind Expres∣sions in it, and in thy Sister <HI>Clopton</HI>'s likewise. I acknowledge my self much obliged to you both, and to the whole Family, for many repeated Kindnesses, and if my School had not ingrossed so much of my Time, I would have taken Opportunity to answer my dear Friend's Letter now, and upon that Account my Delay will be the more ex∣cusable.</P>
<P>The News thou hast heard of my late Change is really true, I cannot conceal it, for it is what I glory in; neither was it any Prospect of temporal Advantage that induced me to it, but a sincere Love to the Truth, and pure Regard to my own Soul: Neither can I be sufficiently thankful to God, that he hath let me live to this glorious Day, and not cut me off in the midst of my Sins and Provocations against him; he is long-suffering to us ward, not willing that any should pe∣rish, but that all should come to Repentance: He hath brought me off from the Forms and Shadows of Religion, and let me see in a more illustrious Manner what is the Life and Substance of it, as he found me in some Degree faithful to that Measure of Light and Know∣ledge he had bestowed on me, whilst I was in the Communion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> therefore he was pleased of late, as I humbly waited upon him, to make known to me greater and deeper Mysteries of his Kingdom; and I can truly say, that I find by daily Experience, as I keep low and retired into that pure Gift which he hath planted within me, Things are every Day more and more cleared up to me. and the Truth shines and prevails greatly over the Kingdom of Dark∣ness; and if I should now turn my Back upon such Manifestations as these, and entangle my self again with the Yoke of Bondage, surely I should grieve the holy Spirit, so that he might justly with∣draw his kind Operations, and never return more to assist and comfort me; for God is not mocked; Religion is a very serious and weighty Thing; Repentance and Salvation are not to be trifled with, nor is Turning to God to be put off till our own Time, Leisure or Conve∣niency, but we must love and cherish the least Appearance of Christ, not slighting or despising the Day of small Things, but embrace the first Opportunity of following Christ in any of his Commands: When he speaks there is such Force and Authority in it, that we cannot stand to cavil, dispute or ask Questions; for unless we will be so ob∣stinate as to shut our Eyes against the Sun, we must needs confess to the Truth of his Doctrine, and presently strike in with it; and therefore when for several Weeks I had lived more privately and re∣tiredly in <HI>London,</HI> than was usual, fasting twice or thrice in a Week, or sometimes more, spending my Time in reading the Scriptures, and in Prayer to God, this was a good Preparation of my Mind to re∣ceive the Truth which he was then about to make known to me: I lamented the Errors of my past Life, and was desirous to attain a more excellent Degree of Holiness than I had discovered in the Church
<PB N="673" REF="003104_0684_0FEFF996EBA28840"/>
of <HI>England.</HI> In this religious Retirement God knew the Breathings of my Soul, how sincere I was, and resigned to him when alone; I wanted him to set me free, and to speak Peace and Comfort to my Soul, which was grieved and wearied with the Burden of Sin; for tho' I had strictly conformed my self to the Orders and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and had kept my self from running into any great or scandalous Enormities, the Fear of the Almighty preserving me, yet still I had not that Rest and Satisfaction in my self which I de∣sired, and greatly longed for; I found when I had examined my State and Condition to God-ward, that Things were not right with me.</P>
<P>As for a sober and plausible Conversation in the Eye of the World, I knew that was a very easy Attainment, a good natural Temper, with the Advantage of a literal Education, will quickly furnish a Man with Abilities for that, so that he shall be looked upon as a Saint, and very spiritual, when perhaps in Chains of Darkness, in the Gall of Bitterness, and in the very Bond of Iniquity: If this Sort of Righ∣teousness would have done, perhaps I might make as fair Pretensions that Way as some others; but alas, I quickly saw the Emptiness and Unsatisfactoriness of those Things: This is a Covering that will not protect or hide us from the Wrath of the Almighty when he comes to Judgment: 'Tis not a Man's natural Temper, nor his Educa∣tion that makes him a good Christian; this is not the Righteousness which the Gospel calls for, nor is this the Truth in the inward Parts which God requires; the Heart and Affections must be cleansed and purified before we can be acceptable to God; therefore it was Death to me to think of taking up my Rest in a formal Pretence of Holiness, wherein yet I saw to my Grief Abundance of People wrapt themselves, slept securely and quietly, Dreaming of the Feli∣city of Paradice, as if Heaven were now their own, and they needed not trouble themselves any more about Religion: I could not enter∣tain so dangerous an Opinion as this, for then I should be tempted to take up my Rest by the Way, whilst I was travelling towards the promised Land. I think I made a little Progress in a holy Life, and thro' God's Assistance I weakned some of my spiritual Enemies whilst I lived in the Communion of the National Church. I thank my God I can truly say, whilst I used those Prayers I did it with Zeal and Sincerity, in his Fear and Dread, but still I ceased not my earnest Supplication to him in private, that he would shew me Something more excellent, that I might get a compleat Victory over all my Lusts and Passions, and might perfect Righteousness before him; for I found a great many Sins and Weaknesses daily attending me: And tho' I made frequent Resolutions to forsake those Sins, yet still the Temp∣tation was too strong for me, so that often I had Cause to complain with the Apostle in the Bitterness of my Soul, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> Who shall set me free, and give me Strength to triumph over Sin, the World, and the Devil? That I may in every Thing please God, and there may not be the least Thought, Word, or Motion, Gesture, or Action, but what is exactly agreeable to his most holy Will, as if I saw him standing before me, and as if I were to be judged by him for the Thought of my Heart next Moment. O Divine Life! O Seraphick Soul! O that I could always stand here! for here is no Reflection, no Sorrow, no Repentance! but at God's Right-Hand there is perfect Peace, and a River of unspeakable Joy. O that we might imitate the Life of Jesus, and be throughly furnished unto every good Word and Work! This was the frequent Breathing of my Soul to God when I was in the Country, but more especially after I had left my new
<PB N="674" REF="003104_0685_0FEFF9DC5B8C0850"/>
Preferment of a Chaplain, and took private Lodgings in <HI>London:</HI> In this Retirement I hope I may say, without Boasting, that I was very devout and religious, and I found great Comfort and Refreshment in it from the Lord, who let me see the Beauty of Holiness; and the Sweetness that arises from an humbled mortified Life, was then ve∣ry pleasant to my Taste, and I rejoiced in it more than in all the De∣light and Pleasures of the World.</P>
<P>And now it pleased God to shew me, that if I would indeed live strictly and holily a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> becomes the Gospel, then I must leave the Com∣munion of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but knew not yet which Way to determine my self, not to what Body of Men I should join, who were more orthodox, and more regular in their Lives. As for the <HI>Quakers,</HI> so called, I was so great a Stranger to them, that I had never read any of their Books, nor do I remember, that ever I converted with any one Man of that Communion in my whole Life: I think there was one in <HI>Foxly</HI> while I was Curate there, but I never saw the Man, tho' I went several Times to his House on Purpose to talk with him, and to bring him off from his mad and wild Enthusiasm, as I then ignorantly thought it to be: As for that Way, I knew it was every where spoken against; he that had a Mind to appear more witty and ingenious than the rest, would chuse this for the Subject of his profane Jests and Drollery; with this he makes Sport, and diverts the Company; for a <HI>Quaker</HI> is but another Name for a Fool or a Mad-man, and was scarce ever mention'd but with Scorn and Contempt. As for Drollery, I consess I was never any great Friend to it; but indeed if all was true that was laid to the <HI>Quakers</HI> Charge, I thought that they were some of the worst People that ever appeared in the World, and wondred with what Face they could call themselves Christians, since I was told they denied the fundamental Articles of the holy Faith, to which I ever bore the highest Veneration and Esteem; and notwithstanding I had always lived at the greatest Distance from that People, and was very zealous in the Worship of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and upon all Occasions would speak very honourably of it, moreover was content to suffer some few Inconveniences upon that Account, (as thou very well knowest) yet my Father still look'd upon me as inclining to the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and some Years ago signified to a Friend, he was afraid I would become an Enthusiast; and whilst I was at <HI>Bungan</HI> School, he sent me two Books to read that were writ against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> one of which was <HI>John; Foldo's,</HI> who hath been sufficiently exposed for it by <HI>William Penn.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst I lived in <HI>London</HI> in that private retired Manner (I was just now speaking of) walking very humbly in the Sight of God, and having Opportunity to reflect upon my past Life, as I had Oca∣sion to be one Day at a Bookseller's Shop, I happened to cast my Eye on <HI>Barclay's</HI> Works; and having heard in the Country, that he was a Man of great Account amongst the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I had a Mind to see what their Principles were, and what Defence they could make for them∣selves; for sure, thought I, these People are not so silly and ridiculous, nor Maintainers of such horrid Opinions, as the Author of the <HI>Snake,</HI> and some others would make us believe. I took <HI>Barclay</HI> home with me, and I read him thro'in a Week's Time, save a little Treatise at the End, which I found to be very philosophical, I omitted; but however I soon read enough to convince me of my own Blindness and Ignorance in the Things of God; there I found a Light to break in upon my Mind, which did mightily resresh and comfort me in that poor, low, and humbled State, in which I then was; for indeed I was then, and had been for a considerable Time before, very hungry
<PB N="675" REF="003104_0686_0FEFF99989E088B0"/>
and thirsty after Rightcousness, and therefore I received the Truth with all Readiness of Mind; 'twas like Balm to my Soul, and as Showers of Rain to the thirsty Earth, which is parched with Heat and Drought. This Author laid Things down so plainly, and proved them with such Ingenuity and Dexterity of Learning, and opened the Scriptures so clearly to me, that without standing to cavil, dispute, raise Argument or Objection., or consulting with Flesh and Blood, I presently resigned my self to God, and weeping for Joy that I had found so great a Treasure, I often thanked him with Tears in my Eyes for so kind a Visitation of his Love, that he was graciously pleased to look to∣ward me when my Soul cried after him; so, tho' before I was in great Doubt and Trouble of Mind, not knowing which way to determine my self, yet now the Sun breaking out so powerfully upon me, the Clouds were scattered: I was now fully satisfied in my own Mind which Way I ought to go, and to what Body of People I should join my self.</P>
<P>So I immediately left the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and went to <HI>Gracious-street</HI> Meeting. After I had read <HI>Barclay,</HI> I read some other Books of that Kind, among which was an excellent Piece, tho' in a small Volume, called, <HI>No Cross, no Crown:</HI> Thus I continued reading and frequenting Meetings for several Weeks together, but did not let any one Soul know what I was about: The first Man I con∣versed with was <HI>George Whitehead,</HI> and this was several Weeks after I began to read <HI>Barclay,</HI> and frequent their Meetings: By him I was introduced into more Acquaintance, and still the farther I went, the more I liked their Plainness, and the Decency and Simplicity of their Conversation: They do not use the Ceremonies and Salutations of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but shake Hands freely, and converse together as Brothers and Sisters that are sprung of the same Royal Seed, and made Kings and Priests unto God. O, the Love, the Sweetness and Tenderness of Affection I have seen among this People! <HI>By this,</HI> says Christ, <HI>shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have Love one to another: Put on therefore,</HI> says the Apostle, (<HI>as the Elect of God holy and beloved) Bowels of Mercy, Kindness, Humbleness of Mind, Meekness, Long-suffering.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, my dear Friend, I have given thee an Account of my Pro∣ceeding on this Affair. As to my Bodily State, if thou desire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to know what it is, I may acquaint thee that I have my Health as well as ever, and I bless God I have Food and Raiment sufficient for m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so that I want no outward Thing; and I have the Necessities and Con∣veniences of Life liberally: Let us not burden our selves with taking Care for the Vanities and Superfluities of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes iv 4</NOTE> let us <HI>possess our Ves∣sels in Sanctification and Honour;</HI> and as we bring our Minds into per∣fect Subjection to the whole Will of God, so let us bring our Body to the most simple and natural Way of living, being content with the fewest Things, never studying to gratify our wanton Appetites, nor to follow the Customs and Humours of Men, but how we may so con∣tract our earthly Cares and Pleasures, that we may bring most Glory to God, most Health and Peace to our own Souls, and do most Ser∣vice to the Truth; and if this be our Aim, certainly a very small Por∣tion of the Things of this World will suffice us: Seeing we are Chris∣tians, we should therefore earnestly pursue those Things which bring us nearest to God, and which are most perfective of humane Nature; for what is more than a Competency seems to be a Burden to a gene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous philosophical Soul, which would breathe in a pare Vehicle, that so it may have a quick Sense and Relish of all Blessings, both of the superior and inferior Worlds.</P>
<P><PB N="676" REF="003104_0687_0FEFF9DFC0556F18"/>Thou knowest, my dear Friend, that Religion is a very serious Thing, and Repentance is a great Work, and one precious immortal Soul is of more Worth, than ten thousand perishing Worlds, with all their Pomp and Glory: Therefore let us take Courage, and be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, let us not content our selves with a Name and Profession of Godliness, let us come to the Life and Power of it, let us not despond of getting the Victory; we have a little Strength for God; let us be faithful to him and he will give us more Strength, so that we shall see the Enemy of our Peace fall be∣fore us, and nothing shall be impossible unto us: I say, my Friend, let us be faithful to that Measure of Light and Knowledge which God has given us, to be profited and edified by it in a spiritual Life. and as God sees we are diligent and faithful to work with the Strength we have, he will more and more enlighten us, so that we shall see to the End of those Forms and Shadows of Religion wherein we have formerly lived; but if he sees we are about to take up our Rest in those Shadows, that we grow cold and indifferent in the Pursait of Holiness, running out into Notions and Speculations, and have more Mind to dispute, and to make a Show of Learning and Subtilty, than to lead a holy and devout Life, then 'tis just with God to leave us in a carnal and polluted State, to continue yet but in the outward Court, where we may please our selves with beholding the Beauty and Ornaments of a worldly Sanctuary, and never witness the Veil being taken away, and that we are brought by the Blood of Jesus into the Holiest of all, where alone there is true Peace with God, and Rest to the weary Soul. I could say much upon this Head, if Time or Lei∣sure would give Leave.</P>
<P>As for a particular Answer to thy Letter, I have not Time now to give it; and for the present let this general Answer suffice: And if thou wilt consider Things in their pure abstracted Nature, and not suffer the Prejudice of Education to sway thee, but in Fear and Humility wilt search out the Truth for thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lf, thou wilt find that there needs no other Answer to thy Letter tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I have already given; for by waiting upon God, and diligently se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing him, thou wilt find Answer to it in thy own Bosom, and this will be much more full, clear, and satisfactory than I, or any other Man living can pretend to give thee, or any other Friend who hath lovingly wrote to me, for whom I desire, with all the sincere-hearted in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that they may come to witness the Almighty Power of God, to save and redeem them from every Yoke; and that they may see clearly to the End of those Things which are abolished, and come to the Enjoy∣ment of spiritual and heavenly Things themselves, is the daily Prayer and deep Travel of my Soul, God knoweth. 'Till I can be more par∣ticular, if thou please thou may'st communicate this to them, and let them know that I am well, and thank them for their kind Letters. Let us remember to pray for one another with all Fervency, that we may Hand perfect in the whole Will of God, <HI>Amen,</HI> saith my Soul. I am thy most affectionate Friend and Servant in Jesus,</P>

<PB N="677" REF="003104_0688_0FEFF99BEF4768A8"/>
Choice of my Persuasion, and Way of returning my Acknowledgments to him. I wish that all, who make any Pretensions to Religion, would make Use of this noble Faculty with Subjection to the Divine Will, to determine their Choice in this grand Affair; and not let the Religion of their Educa∣tion be that of their Judgment. If People were thus truly wise unto their own Salvation, and did not too lazily resign thmselves to the Conduct of their Guide, thereby regarding more their Ease than Safety, they would not on∣ly be the better able to give a Reason of the Hope that is in them, but they would shew more Warmth in their Devotion, more Charity in their Religion, and more Piety in their Conversation than at present they do.</P>
<P>When I was visited some Time ago by the chastising Hand of the Lord for Sin, and my Disobedience to his holy Will, I laboured under great Afflic∣tion of Mind and Anguish of Spirit; and tho' I was constant above many in my Attendance on the publick Prayers of the Church, strict in my Ob∣servation of its Ceremonies, and exceeding frequent in the Use of private Devotion, yet my Barden encreased, and I waxed worse.</P>
<P>In this wretched and doleful Condition I was, when at a Relation's House, who had providentially returned from <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to his native Country, I lighted upon <HI>R. Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lay's Apology for the Quakers;</HI> by the Reading whereof I was so we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l persuaded of their Principles, and by turning my Mind inward to the divine G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, (according to their D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trine) it gave me Victory in a great Measure, over our common Enemy, banished away my disorderly Imaginations, and restored me to my former Regularity: I re∣ceived such Satisfaction and Comfort to my distressed Soul, that thereupon I left the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and joined my self in Society with them; and I am the more confirmed in my Change, especially where it respects the Worship of our Creator, because it is not only the most agreeable to the Scriptures of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John iv 23, 24. Rom. viii 26, 27 Lam. xxv. 26 Ps. xxvii. 14. x. 17 Eph. vi. 18 Jude 20, &amp;</NOTE> Truth, but Heaven has given us Assurance of its Approba∣tion thereof, it having been at Times, to my own Experience, most powerfully attended with the Presence of the Most High.</P>
<P>I hope none will begrudge me this Mercy, because I received it not by their Ministry; if they do, I have Cause to suspect their Charity is not of a Christian Latitude, since our blessed Redeemer approved not of that Nar∣rowness in his Disciples in somewhat a like Case.</P>
<P>But here to obviate the Objection some may make to my Change, be∣cause of the Distress I lay under, and the Discomposure I was subject to at Times, I would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remark'd, that I read the said Apology be∣yond my Expectation, with more Sedateness than usual, and a more quiet Composure of Mind: So that with the Influence of the Almighty, or Pro∣vidence, or both, I had also the Benefit of that distinguishing Faculty of Man in the Change of my Opinion. O that I may never forget the Lord's Mercy to my Soul, who had Compassion on me when I wallowed in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood, and who said to the dry Bones, Live. O that all such as are visited by the chastising Hand of their Maker, would seriously lay it to Heart, and consider their own Welfare and Salvation; I could with with all my Heart, that such who labour under this Anxiety of Mind, would take Encou∣ragement to hope in the Lord's Mercy thro' their blessed Redeemer, by his Kindness and long Forbearance with me. I am a living Monument of it now; and I hope I shall be so, while he affords me a Being here. If these Lines sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld come to the Hands of any that are afflicted and distressed as I was, I have an effectual Remedy, thro' Mercy, to prescribe unto them; Turn your Minds inward to the Grace of God in your own Hearts, re∣frain from your own Imaginations, be still, and quietly resign your selves to his holy Will, so you shall and Health to your Souls, Refreshm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to your Spirits, and the sweet Consolation of the Lord in your own B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soms; you shall find your Mourning turned to Gladness, and your Heaviness to Joy; this has been my Experience of the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dness of the Holy One of

<P>As for renouncing the Covenant which I and every Christian ought to be under, of forsaking the Devil and all his Works, I am so far from enter∣taining one Thought of neglecting that Duty, that I think my self wholly obliged to observe it: And if I should affirm, that thro' the Grace of God, and his Assistance, (for otherwise I am satisfied I cannot do it,) the Ob∣servation of it is possible, I can find no Reason why it should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e false Do∣ctrine in a <HI>Quaker,</HI> more than in a Church-man.</P>
<P>As for Deserting the Church and Ministry which the Son of God came down from Heaven to establish, I am not conscious to my self thereof; for I say, Christ himself is the Head of our Church, and by his Spirit and Grace the Ordainer of our Ministry.</P>
<P>And as to the last Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry my ingenious Acquaintance is pleased to pro∣pose, I do let him know, that my former Despair and forlorn Condition has been, since my adhering to that reproached People, changed into a sweet Enjoyment of the Goodness of God. I could not conceal the Lord's Goodness, left he should withdraw his Mercies from me.</P>
<P>I had no secular Interest to corrupt me in this Change, it is apparent to many, I declined it; but as it was Peace with God my Maker, and Mercy to my Soul I wanted; so having found the Pearl of great Price among them, I parted with all to purchase it; or rather I was restored to all, I mean, the Enjoyment of the Divine Goodness, and of my self, by setting a due Value upon it.</P>

<P>To this Address the Queen was pleased to answer;</P>
<Q><P><HI>I thank you for your Address,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aver.</NOTE> and ye may depend upon my Protection.</P></Q>
<P>The Animosities mention'd in this Address, did regard the Division, which having been a good while among the Subjects, began to encrease, as many thought by the Change of the Ministry. But this being out of my Province, I won't meddle with it.</P>
<P>In the Year 1712 died <HI>Richard Cromwel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1712 <HI>Death of</HI> R. Cromwel</NOTE> the Son of <HI>Oliver</HI> the Pro∣tector, about the Age of ninety Years. Great Changes this Man had seen, having himself been the supreme Ruler of <HI>England,</HI> as hath been mention'd in due Place.</P>
<P>Altho' I do not intend to relate much more of any Occurrences, because I hasten towards a Conclusion, yet I think it worth the while to add the following Case;</P>
<P>In the Year 1713,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1713 Justice <HI>Penry</HI> prosecuted on the Act against Occasional Con∣formity.</NOTE> in the Spring, there was a Suit at Law; on the Act against <HI>Occasional Conformity.</HI> It happened that one <HI>John Penry,</HI> a Justice of Peace of <HI>Ailborough,</HI> in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> going to the Parish Church, understood by the Way, that no Service was to be done there at that Time; but hearing that there was a <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting there, he went to it. One <HI>Wall,</HI> the Bailiff of the Place, being informed there∣of, imagined that the said Justice might not go there, because of the aforesaid Act, and therefore thinking that something might be gained by it, got Witnesses to declare that the said Justice had been in the Meeting; and said afterwards in a boasting Way to him, <HI>Now I have book'd you.</HI> To which the other reply'd, <HI>I'll stand to it.</HI> The Bailiff then entered his Suit in the Name of one that lived thereabouts by Cha∣rity. When the Case was pleaded at the Sessions, the Judge, who was Baron <HI>Salath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el Lovel,</HI> declared the Meaning of the fore-mentioned Act to be thus, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That it did not regard any who accidentally went into a Meeting of Dissenters; but that it was against those who con∣formed with the Church, thereby to qualify themselves for an Office, without changing their Religion.</Q> But this was Quite another Case; for the Priest of the Parish himself, gave a Certificate that the said Justice was a good Member of the Church. From hence it appeared that this Suit was meer Malice; and the Informers or Witnesses were brought to that Pinch, that they durst not expect the Verdict of the Jury, for fear that they should have been condemned to pay the Charges; and therefore they let the Thing fall. Being now entred into this Year, I can't omit to say, that a Peace between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> being concluded, and the Subjects from all Parts of the Nation congratula∣ting the Queen with Addresses, the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not omit also to pre∣sent an Address; being as follows;</P>

<P>This Address, which chiefly contained an Assurance of Fidelity to the Queen, yet was accepted favourably.</P>
<P>In the next Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1714</NOTE> being that of 1714, the Queen was often ill, and there was much Division among the People: For a Bill was brought into Parliament called, <HI>An Act to prevent the Growth of Schism;</HI> and the Party that prevailed then was very active to get this Bill pass'd. And since if tended to deprive the Dissenters from keeping Schools, and to allow that Liberty to none but Members of the Episcopal Church, or at least to no Body but who had Licence from them, it met with great Opposition, and many Reasons against i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were published; and the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> offered also to the Legislature the following Rea∣sons against it;</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THe Church of</HI> England <HI>hath frequently declared,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quakers</HI> Rea∣sons against the Bill to prevent the Growth of Schism.</NOTE> <HI>by several of her Members, in a Clerical, as well as Civil Capacity, by those who framed and espoused one or more of the Bills against</HI> Occasional Conformity, <HI>That</HI> She is in Principle against Persecution, and for Preserving the Toleration.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Promoters of this Bill may please to remember, that the Queen hath declared from the Throne, That She will</HI> Maintain the Toleration inviolable.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The Protestant Subjects of this Kingdom, who are Parents of Chil∣dren, are supposed to have preserved to them, by the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, the Natural Right if the Care and Direction of the Edu∣cation of their own Children; which Natural Right this Bill seems calcu∣lated to take away and destroy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>If the Governments, which are now either</HI> Heathen <HI>or</HI> Mahometan, <HI>should take into the same Policy, the Society which the Queen hath incorpo∣rated for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, can have very little, if any good Effect or Success.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>May it not seem an Objection and Contradiction to the many Princely and Christian Sollicitations which the Queen by her Ministers hath made at Foreign Courts, on the Behalf of Protestants, against the violent Intrusions of Papists into their Rights and just Privileges?</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>It may be a Means to oblige the carrying out of large Sums of Mo∣ney for Foreign Education.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>It may probably do much Hurt to Charitable Foundations.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>It seems not to be agreeable to that great Law of Christ,</HI> Matt. vii. 12. Therefore all Things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</P>
<P><PB N="681" REF="003104_0692_0FEFF9A082930EC0"/>But whatever was objected, the said Bill at length pass'd, and was confirmed with the Royal Assent, which gave Occasion to the <HI>Quakers</HI> to add in the Conclusion of the printed Epistle of their Annual Assem∣bly at <HI>London,</HI> the following Caution and Exhortation: <HI>There seems at present to hang over us a Cloud, threatning a Storm.

Whitehead,</HI> with some of his Friends got Access; and they were intro∣duced by one of the Prince's Gentlemen into a Chamber, where the Prince met them; and then <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> spoke to him, the Substance of which was as followeth:</P>
<Q><P><HI>We take it as a Favour that we are thus admitted to see the Prince of</HI> Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Speech to the Prince.</NOTE> <HI>and truly are very glad to see Thee; having delivered our Address to the King thy Royal Father, and being desirous to give Thy self a Visit in true Love, we very heartily wish Health and Happiness to you both; and that if it should please God Thou shouldest survive thy Father, and come to the Throne, Thou mayst enjoy Tranquility and Peace,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>I am persuaded, that if the King thy Father and Thy self do stand for the Toleration for Liberty of Conscience to be kept inviolable, God will stand by you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May King</HI> Solomon<HI>'s Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Wisdom be thy Choice, with Holy</HI> Job<HI>'s Integrity, and Compassion to the Oppressed; and the State of the righteous Ruler commended by King</HI> David,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. xxiii. 3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> He that ruleth over Men must be just, ruling in the Fear of God; and he shall be as the Light of the Morning when the Sun riseth, even a Morning without Clouds, as the tender Grass springing out of the Earth by clear shining after Rain.</P></Q>
<P>This Speech was favourably heard by the Prince.</P>
<P>It was not long after the King's coming over,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></NOTE> that Dr. <HI>Gilbert Bur∣net,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> the renowned Author of the History of the Reformation in <HI>England,</HI> died. He generally had shewed himself mo∣derate, and had written very plainly against Persecution in Matters of Faith, especially in his <HI>Apology for the Church of</HI> England, first printed in <HI>Holland</HI> in the Year 1688, and afterwards also in <HI>England,</HI> wherein among other Things he said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He had writ∣ten against Persecution.</NOTE> <HI>I will not deny but many of the Dissenters were put to great Hardships in many Parts of</HI> England; <HI>I cannot deny it, and I am sure I will never justify it— And I will boldly say this, That if the Church of</HI> England, <HI>after she is got out of this Storm, will return to hearken to the Peevishness of some soure Men, she will be abandoned both of God and Man, and will set both Heaven and Earth against her.</HI></P>
<P>The Year being come to an End,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1715</HI> The Term of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Affirmation</NOTE> I go on to that of 1715. In the Month called <HI>May</HI> it was moved in Parliament, that the Term of the Act for the <HI>Quakers</HI> Solemn Affirmation was almost expired; and there∣upon
<PB N="683" REF="003104_0694_0FEFF9A4398E40C0"/>
it was resolved, that a Bill should be brought in to prolong that said Term; and on the 7th of the said Month a Bill was accordingly brought into the House of Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">being near ex∣pired, the same is perpetuated, and extended to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the <HI>American</HI> Plantations for five Years.</NOTE> read the first Time, and five Days after, the second Time, and committed. And whereas the former Act was limited to a Term of Years, this Limitation was omitted now, and consequently the Act was to be perpetual. The Bill thus far advanced, was at length engrossed, and on the second of the Month called <HI>June,</HI> after a third Reading, passed in the House of Commons, and was sent to the Lords, from whence it was sent back with this Addition, That this Favour should be extended also to the Northern Part of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> known by the Name of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to the Plantations belonging to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> for five Years (for so far the former Act had not reach'd) and to the End of next Sessions of Parliament.</P>
<P>This Amendment was agreed to by the House of Commons on the 13th of the said Month, and on the last of that Month it was confirm∣ed by the Royal Assent. Thus the <HI>Quakers</HI> were protected a-new a∣gainst the heavy Shock which otherwise they might have expected on the Refusal of an Oath. King <HI>George</HI> on all Occasions having shewn himself favourable unto them, they did not omit thankfully to acknow∣ledge his Kindness, as appears from the General Epistle of their Annual Assembly, where they expressed their Gratitude in these Words;</P>
<P><HI>The Lord our God, who for the Sake of his Heritage hath often here∣tofore rebuked and limited the raging Waves of the Sea, hath, blessed be his Name, mercifully dispersed the Cloud threatning a Storm, which lately seemed to hang over us; which together with the Favour God hath given us in the Eyes of the King, and the Government, for the free Enjoyment of our Religious and Civil Liberties, call for true Thankfulness to him. And humbly to pray to Almighty God for the King and those in Authority, for his and their Safety and Defence, is certainly our Christian Duty, as well as to walk inoffensively as a grateful People.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they signified their Thankfulness for the Favour they enjoyed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rebellion at <HI>Preston,</HI> so∣mented by some hot-headed Clergymen, suppress'd by the King's Forces</NOTE><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But seeing from the first Grant of an Affirmation instead of an Oath, the Form then obtained was not entirely such as was desired, and many were not easy therewith; They several Times applied to the Parliament for a more easy Form, which at length, thro' the merciful Providence of God, and the Favour of King <HI>George</HI> and the Parliament, was ob∣tained in the latter End of the Year 1721. the Form now being L A.

<P>This Rebellion being thus happily quenched, induced the Inhabitants of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to congratulate the King with Addresses; and these Congratulations being become so general, the People called <HI>Qukers</HI> were not wanting to prepare also an Address, to testify their Loyalty; and to express their Joy for the Quelling of the Rebellion; and there∣fore in their Yearly Meeting they drew up an Address, which they pre∣sented to the King on the last Day of the Month called <HI>May,</HI> being in∣troduced by the Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> one of the Gentlemen of the King's Bed-chamber, when <HI>G.

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the KING,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE thy Faithful and Peaceable Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Address.</NOTE> being met in this our <HI>Annual Assembly,</HI> do hold our selves obliged in Point of Principle and Gra∣titude, rather than by formal and frequent Addresses, humbly and openly to acknowledge the manifold Blessings and kind Providences of God, which have attended these Kingdoms ever since thy happy Accession to the Throne.</P>
<P>And as our Religion effectually enjoins us Obedience to the Supreme Au∣thority, so it is with great Satisfaction that we pay it to a Prince, whose Justice, Clemency and Moderation cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndear, and firmly unite the Hearts and Affections of all his true Protestant Subjects.</P>
<P>We are therefore sorrowfully affected with the Unhappiness of those our Countrymen who have so little Gratitude or Goodness, as to be uneasie un∣der so just and mild an Administration: Nor can we reflect on the late unjust and unnatural Rebellion, without concluding the Promoters thereof, and Actors therein, were Men infatuated, and hurried by such an Evil Spi∣rit, as would lay waste and destroy both the Civil and Religious Liberties of these Protestant Nations.</P>
<P>And as God, the Lord of Hosts, hath most signally appeared to the Con∣founding that <HI>Black Conspiracy,</HI> so We pray his Good Providence may al∣ways attend the King's Councils and Undertakings, to the establishing his Throne in Righteousness and Peace, and making his House a sure House.</P>
<P>Permit us therefore, <HI>Great Prince,</HI> to lay hold of this Opportunity to approach Thy Royal Presence, with Our Hearty Thanks to the King and

his Great Council, for all the Privileges and Liberties We enjoy. To behold a Prince upon the Throne, solicitous for the Ease and Happiness of his People beyond my other Views, so heightens our Satisfaction and Joy, that We want Words to express our full Sense thereof. And therefore We can do no less than assure the King, That as it is our Duty to demean our selves towards the King's Person and Government with all faithful Obedi∣ence, so we are determined, by Divine Assistance, devoutly and heartily to pray the God and Father of all our Mercies, To vouchsafe unto the King a Long, Peaceable and Prosperous Reign: And that when it shall please the Almighty to remove from Us so precious a Life, by taking it to Him∣self, there may not want a Branch of Thy Royal Family endowed with Wisdom and Virtue to fill the Throne, till Time shall be no more.</P>

<P>To this Address the King was pleased to give this Gracious Answer.</P>
<Q><P><HI>I thank you for the Assurance of Duty and Affection to my Person and Government,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer.</NOTE> <HI>contained in this Address; and you may always depend upon my Protection.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Thus we again s;ee a Prince on the Throne, who solemnly assureth the <HI>Quakers</HI> so called, of his Protection; so that now they enjoy the due Liberty of Subjects that behave themselves peaceably and dutifully under the Government set over them, in like Manner as other Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> And therefore they have not neglected to ex∣hort one another to shew their Thankfulness to Almighty God, and to pray for the King, as it hath been intimated already, that this was re∣commended in one of the Epistles of their Yearly Meeting. Now since mention hath several Times been made in this History of those Epistles of the Annual Assembly to the particular Churches, I have thought fit to insert here one of them, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Year 1717,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1717</NOTE> which is as followeth:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>The Epistle from the Yearly-Meeting in <HI>London,</HI> Held, by Adjourn∣ment, from the 10th Day of the <HI>Fourth Month,</HI> to the 14th of the same, inclusive, <HI>1717.</HI> To the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings of Friends, in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and elsewhere.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Salutation in the Love of <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> our blessed Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salutation to Friends</NOTE> is freely extended unto you, whose tender Care over, and Mer∣cy to this our <HI>Annual Assembly,</HI> we do humbly and thankfully acknow∣ledge, in the Love, Amity, tender Condescension and peaceable Pro∣cedure thereof, with Respect to the <HI>Divine Power and Goodness</HI> of the Lord our God, and the Service of his Church and People; sincerely desiring the Prosperity of his whole Heritage, even in all the Chur∣ches of Christ among us, in his dear Love, Unity and Peace, to his Eternal Glory, and our universal Comfort and perpetual Joy in the Kingdom of the dear Son of God.</P>
<P>We are truly comforted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general Con¦currence among Friends</NOTE> in that we understand there is such a gene∣ral Concurrence and Union among <HI>Friends,</HI> with our former earnest Desires and Council, for true and universal Love, Unity, Peace and good Order, to be earnestly endeavoured and maintained among us, as a peculiar People, chosen of the Lord out of the World, to bear a faith∣ful Testimony to his holy Name and Truth, in all Respects; and that all that is contrary be watched against and avoided; as <HI>Strife, Discord, Contention,</HI> and <HI>Disputes</HI> tending to Divisions, may be utterly suppress'd and laid aside, as the Light and righteous Judgment of Truth require.</P>
<P><PB N="686" REF="003104_0697_0FEFF9ED82598448"/>Oh! that all the <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Congregations</HI> of the Faithful, would be excited by the Spirit of the dear Son of God, fervently to pray for the Prosperity of his Church and People throughout the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excited to pray for the Prospe∣rity of the Church.</NOTE> that <HI>Sion</HI> may more and more shine in the Beauty of Holiness, to the Glory and Praise of the King of Glory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> come up from the several <HI>Quarterly-Meetings</HI> in this Nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of Truth's Pros∣perity.</NOTE> have given a good Account to this Meeting of Truth's Prosperity, and that <HI>Friends</HI> are generally in Love and Unity one with another, and by several Epistles from <HI>Friends</HI> of <HI>North Ca∣rolina, Jersey, Pennsilvania, Maryland, Barbadoes, Holland, Scotland, Ireland</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> which have been read in this Meeting; as also by verbal Accounts, given by several <HI>Friends</HI> that have lately travelled in divers Parts of <HI>America,</HI> and elsewhere, we have received comfortable Accounts of the State of Truth and Friends in those Parts; by which we are encouraged to hope Truth prevails in many Places, and a Con∣cern grows upon <HI>Friends</HI> for the Prosperity thereof; and that there is an Inclination in People, to hear the Truth declared.</P>
<P>By the Accounts brought up this Year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends Suf∣ferings.</NOTE> We find that <HI>Friends</HI> Suf∣ferings in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> amount to <HI>five Thousand two Hundred and Ninty</HI> Pounds and upwards, chiefly for <HI>Tythes, Priests Wages,</HI> and <HI>Steeple-House Rates;</HI> and that notwithstanding there have been <HI>four Friends</HI> discharged the last Year, there yet remain <HI>twenty Friends</HI> Prisoners on these Accounts.</P>
<P>We advise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advice to be faithful in a Testimony a∣gainst Tythes.</NOTE> That a tender Care remain upon <HI>Friends</HI> in all Places to be faithful in keeping up our Christian Testimony against <HI>Tythes,</HI> as being fully persuaded, it is that whereunto God hath called his Peo∣ple in this our Day; we seeing by daily Experience, That such as are not faithful therein, do thereby add to the Sufferings of honest Friends, and hinder their own Growth and Prosperity in the most blessed Truth.</P>
<P>As touching <HI>The Education of Friends Children,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Concern for the Education of Friends Children.</NOTE> for which this Meet∣ing hath often found a Concern; We think it our Duty to recommend unto you, the Necessity that there is of a Care in preserving of them in Plainness of Speech and Habit, suitable to our holy Profession: And also, that no Opportunity be omitted, nor any Endeavour wanting, to instruct them in the <HI>Principle of Truth</HI> which we profess, that thereby they, being sensible of the Operation thereof in themselves, may find, not only their Spirits softned and tendered, fit to receive the Impressions of the <HI>Divine Image,</HI> but may also from thence find themselves under a Necessity to appear clear in the several Branches of our Christian Testi∣mony. And as this will be most beneficial to them, being the Fruits of Conviction; so it is the most effectual Way of propagating the same throughout the Churches of Christ. And there being Times and Sea∣sons wherein their Spirits are (more than at others) disposed to have those Things impressed upon them; so we desire that all Parents and others concerned in the Oversight of <HI>Youth,</HI> might wait in the Fear of God, to know themselves divinely qualified for that Service that in his Wisdom they may make Use of every such Opportunity, which the Lord shall put into their Hands. And we do hereby warn and advise Friends in all Places to flee every Appearance of Evil, and keep out of <HI>Pride,</HI> and following the <HI>Vain Fashions</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of this World, as recommended in the <HI>Epistle</HI> 1715.</P>
<P>And as we always found it our Concern to recommend <HI>Love, Con∣cord</HI> and <HI>Unity</HI> in the <HI>Churches of Christ</HI> every where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Love and Uni∣ty recommend∣ed</NOTE> so as a Means to effect the same, We earnestly desire that <HI>Friends,</HI> but more especial∣ly such as are concerned in Meetings of <HI>Business,</HI> do labour to know their own Spirits <HI>subjected</HI> by the <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> that thereby being <HI>Baptized into our Body,</HI> they may be truly <HI>One</HI> in the Foundation of

their <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Unity,</HI> and that therein they may all labour to find a <HI>Nearness</HI> to each other in Spirit; this being the true Way to a tho∣rough <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> whenever there is or may have been any Differ∣ence of Apprehension: Thereby <HI>Friends</HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be preserved in that <HI>Sweetness of Spirit,</HI> that is and will be the <HI>Bond of true Peace</HI> through∣out all the Churches of Christ.</P>
<P>And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Geneva Contribution recommended</NOTE> <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> the <HI>Friends</HI> of this Meeting, to whom the In∣spection of the Accounts was referred, made Report, That having perused the same, they found the Stock to be near expended; where∣upon this Meeting thinks it necessary to recommend unto you, That a General and Free Contribution be made in every County, and that what shall be thereupon collected, be sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the respective Corre∣spondents.</P>

<P>From this Epistle may be judged in some Degree of the others, which are sent from the Yearly Meeting of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> to the particular Meetings of their Society every where. We see by it that they give Notice of the State of their particular Churches, and that they earnestly recommend Love and Unity among their Brethren, with other Christian Virtues and especially a good Education of their Chil∣dren, besides other Matters which they judge to be meet and necessary. With this Epistle here inserted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusion of the History.</NOTE> I'll finish this Work, as having per∣formed my Design and Intention, <HI>viz.</HI> the giving of a plain and circum∣stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial Account and Relation of the Rise of this Religious Society, which, as we have seen, sprung from mean Beginnings, to a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣crease and Progress, and extended it self far, notwithstanding the vio∣lent Opposition, and most grievous Severity, for suppressing and rooting them out, so often put in Practice, and committed by their Enemies, but all in vain, and they now enjoy an undisturbed Liberty to perform the publick Exercise of their Worship to God, since their Religion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> permitted by Law; which Liberty they in no wise have obtained by making Resistance, but by a long-suffering Patience, a Peaceable De∣portment, and a dutiful Fidelity to the Government set over them; so that now they see clearly, that God doth not forsake those that don't forsake him, according to what the Prophet <HI>Azariah</HI> formerly said to King <HI>Asa,</HI> and all <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> 2 Chron. xv. 2. <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you: But if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</HI> Having thus performed what I intended with this Historical Relation, I conclude it, to the Praise and Glory of the most High, who hath afforded me Life-time and Ability, after a long and difficult Labour, to bring this History to a suitable.</P>

<P>The Author, toward the Conclusion of this History, having given some Account of the Principles of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> thought fit in the <HI>Dutch Appendix,</HI> (amomg other Things) to add the following Trea∣tise in <HI>Latin</HI> concerning the <HI>Light,</HI> written about the Year <HI>1662.</HI> And since in this <HI>English</HI> Translation, the subject Matters contained in the said <HI>Appendix,</HI> are informed in the Body of the History, in those Places to which they prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no Reference being made to This, but as mentioned in the Preface, 'tis thought fit to subjoin it here, with the following Words of the Author prefix'd to the same,</P>
<P><HI>IN the</HI> Preface <HI>to this History, Mention is made of a certain Book intituled,</HI> The Light upon the Candlestick, <HI>published in the Name (as many supposed) of</HI> William Ames, <HI>yet no ways writ by him, tho' it con∣tains his Doctrine, but by a certain Learned Man, unwilling to be known publickly, and as it seems to me writ originally in</HI> Latin; <HI>which, tho' printed, being in but few Hands, I have thought fit to reprint.</HI></P>
<P>And the Original in <HI>Latin</HI> soon after the first Publication being translated into <HI>English</HI> by <HI>B. F.</HI> was printed in the Year <HI>1663,</HI> from which Trans∣lation take it as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="excerpt from book">
<HEAD>The Light upon the Candlestick.</HEAD>
<P>THings are not for Words, but Words for Things: If therefore we understand Things aright, and as they ought, by Words, it must be by such as are fit to imprint the Things themselves in those to whom they should occur, and then it were enough (to make known our Thoughts to others as we conceive them) only to make use of such Words.</P>
<P>But forasmuch as we find the Matter in this Case far otherwise, and that two Men speaking or writing the same Words, may nevertheless have different, yea, sometimes contrary Thoughts, the Disability of performing this fitly by Words or Discourse is clearly inferred. Nor may we at all wonder at it, seeing we know to what a perpetual Change Languages are subject, even such, that the very Words may be changed from their pristine Signification. And the Imperfection is so great, that whosoever should have invented them, such as now they are in Use, we should certainly believe that he had little or no Knowledge of those Things that are thereby intended to be signified. So that if we would better express Things unto another by Words and Speeches, we had need find new Words, and consequently a whole new Language: But that would be a Toil and Labour indeed.</P>
<P>In the mean while we see what a Sea of Confusion flows from hence upon all Mankind: For altho' there should be none, who sometimes through Ignorance, and sometimes by Subtilty or Wickedness might wrest or pervert Words contrary to the Mind of the Speaker or Writer, in such Manner as themselves that so do should think best for their own Ends, from whence consequently all this Deceit, Slandering, Contention, and the like proceeds; yet so it is, that how uprightly or prudently so∣ever a Man goes to Work in this Matter, he nevertheless finds himself liable to mislead, or to be mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed.</P>
<P><PB N="689" REF="003104_0700_0FEFF9F149CEFC80"/>But although the Case be thus with Words and Discourses at pre∣sent in Use, yet for all that, they are the most ready, and so far as I know, the fittest Means to make known all our Thoughts unto others by: And for this Reason therefore, tho' so much Confusion and Deceit happen to arise from hence, that no Man that hath any Experience can be ignorant thereof: Yet may we not (therefore) be too much afraid of them neither, as many yet do manifest themselves to be, who be∣cause they have some Experience hereof, are apt to believe we are a∣bout to deceive them, especially if they be but forewarned thereof.</P>
<P>This, as in many Things, so it hath chiefly taken Place in that which is commonly esteemed for Religion: In which 'tis so with most Men, that they will scarce give Audience to, much less take into Con∣sideration any Thing held forth unto them, by any whom they judge not to be of their own Opinion, as they imagine, to avoid being thereby deluded.</P>
<P>Yet if they were thus towards their own Party, we might think it was an Act of Prudence, and that they would see with their own Eyes: But no, in no wise, this is too hard a Task: Whatsoever cometh on that Side, is received with such Partiality for good and current Coin, as if there were no Danger nor Possibility of Erring: Whereas nevertheless it is all alike with the one as with the other Opinion. It all depends but upon a Possibility of being nearest to the Truth; And for the up∣holding every one his own Opinion, and defending it against others, there is so much ado, so much Pains taken, so much Scholastick Learn∣ing, Study and Disputing, that one would rather believe that there were no true Religion at all, than that this should needs be it.</P>
<P>Seeing then 'tis thus at present, can we much blame the Common People, that they despair of ever being able to solve this Difficulty, and are glad when they can but find any that are greedy of the Work, upon whom they may cast the whole Burthen? Surely no: For he that sees but a little clearly, sees, that there is always Contention behind, and no End till a Man grows weary of it: Nor is the Conquest just his that hath Truth, but that can best handle his Tongue. A miserable Thing if it were thus to be fought and found! But it is not so with the True Religion.</P>
<P>Go to then, O Man, whoever thou art, we will not draw thee off from one Society of Men, to carry thee over unto another, 'tis some∣what else we invite thee to. Lend us but a little Audience: Surely thou knowest thus much, That as it is an Extremity to receive all Things without Distinction, that present themselves to us; so 'tis no less to reject all Things without Judgment. We invite thee to something which may be a Means whereby to attain to thy own Salvation and Well-being: Be as distrustful, or rather prudent or foresighted as thou wilt, thou canst not in Reason refuse us thy Ear in this Thing: All the Damage thou canst possibly have by doing that which we exhort thee to, is only to have taken a little Pains in vain, if that which is promised should not succeed: Whereas on the contrary, if it should succeed, thou mayest come to the Enjoyment of a Matter of so great Worth, that would not be exchanged for all that is esteemed great in the Earth. Moreover, 'tis not far to seek, but at hand, 'tis <HI>nigh</HI> thee, yea and in thy self. And there thou mayest experience the Trial of that which we declare, which is the most certain and sure that can be desired.</P>
<P>We direct thee then to <HI>within thy self,</HI> that is, that thou oughtest to turn into, to mind and have Regard unto that which is <HI>within thee,</HI> to wit, <HI>The Light of Truth, the true Light which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> Here 'tis that thou must be, and not <HI>without</HI> thee. Here thou shalt find a Principle certain and infallible,
<PB N="690" REF="003104_0701_0FEFF9F55958E440"/>
and whereby encreasing and going on therein, thou mayest at length ar∣rive unto a happy Condition: Of this thou mayst safely adventure the Trial, But it thou darest not do so much, 'tis hard to help thee. And if thou happenest to be one of those that wouldst it know all Things, be∣fore thou dost begin, yea, even those Things which are experienced in a Condition to which thou art so much a Stranger, that there's nothing in thee hath so much Agreement therewith, as to comprehend it ac∣cording to Truth: Know this, Thou dost (therein) just as those that would learn to Read, without knowing the Letters.</P>
<P>To desire to know all Things that we are capable of, is good and laud∣able: But to go further, is Folly. There will be always something else to ask, and our Knowledge will ever be too short. He that will not adventure till he be fully satisfied, shall never begin, much less finish it to his own Salvation.</P>
<P>But we judge it needful, as much as in us lies, to open unto you that unto which we do exhort you, that People may understand what it properly is.</P>
<P>We say then, That we exhort every ene to turn in to the <HI>Light</HI> that is in him, (We give it rather the Appellation of <HI>Light,</HI> than any Thing else, otherwise it is all one to us whether ye call it <HI>Christ, the Spirit, the Word,</HI> &amp;c. seeing these all denote but one and the same Thing:) Yet the Word <HI>Light</HI> being in its natural Signification somewhat else than that which we intend thereby, we shall therefore in brief endeavour clearly to express what we intend under this Denomination,</P>
<P><HI>The Light</HI> (then we say) <HI>is a clear and distinct Knowledge of Truth in the Understanding of every Man, by which he is so convinced of the Being and Quality of Things, that he cannot possibly doubt thereof.</HI></P>
<P>From this Definition which is here given of the <HI>Light,</HI> 'tis clear, that it must needs comprehend in it the principal Effect of shewing us, and giving us the Knowledge of what is <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Falshood,</HI> what is <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil;</HI> which verify is a Matter of so great Concernment, that with∣out it Men must needs swerve up and down in continual Darkness. Opi∣nion and Sin, neither knowing Truth at all, nor doing any Good, but gropingly, by hap-hazard, without any Certainty.</P>
<P><HI>This Light then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light as to Man, what it is, defined.</NOTE> Christ, the Truth,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>is that which makes manifest and reproves Sin in Men, shewing him how he is strayed from God, ac∣cus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Evil which he doth, and both committed; yea, this is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and condemneth him.</HI> Again,</P>
<P><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the Preaching to every Creature under Heaven, tho' they have never read or heard of the Scripture. This is it which leads Man in Truth, into the way to God, which excuseth him in well-doing, giving him Peace in his Conscience, yea, brings him to Union with God, wherein all Happi∣ness and Salvation do consist.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, seeing it is properly the Nature of this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Effect put for the Cause</NOTE> <HI>Light</HI> infallibly to discover Sin and Evil, <HI>to reprove and convince thereof; it can never possibly consent thereunto.</HI> And altho' it be true indeed, that the Ope∣rations of the <HI>Light</HI> are not in all Men alike powerful, in whom it is nevertheless; yea (though) in some Men (it) seems to have no Ope∣ration at all: Yet this is occasioned only by those Impediments that do hinder it: For as the <HI>Natural Light</HI> by the Interposition of other Bodies of Covers, may be hindered from having its Operation there where else it would, were those Things which impede removed, the <HI>Light</HI> (it self) still abiding in its self unchanged; even so it is also with this <HI>Light</HI> whereof we speak. The Lett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this are manifold. All whatsoever we meet with in this World seems to proclaim War in this Case. What is there that hath not a powerful Operation upon one or other of the Senses of Man, thro' which passing over into the
<PB N="691" REF="003104_0702_0FEFF9F82BA99CC0"/>
Soul, the Memory is so filled, that nothing else can enter. The Eyes and Ears stand so perpetually open to all Things, that they never want an Object to bring to Mind the Experience of that which pleased the Body so well; And this stirs up the Desire to enjoy it, yet all Without Satiety: The Objects they are multifarious, the Enjoyment can be but single and transient, and the Causes incessant.</P>
<P>Now where this operateth in us after this Manner, by Education and Example in Manners and Customs which are regulated by Opinion, and not by the <HI>True Light,</HI> that Men live altogether therein; is it any Won∣der that here (in these Men) there is so little, or no Operation of the <HI>Light?</HI> Not at all.</P>
<P>We are so involved into the Desire of that which is high in the World, so overwhelmed in Pleasures, that it's almost impossible for the <HI>Light</HI> to cause one Desire after <HI>Good</HI> to spring or bubble up.</P>
<P>Where then these so contrary Operations to the <HI>Light</HI> are, there it can never break through.</P>
<P>According to the Nature and Kind of every Thing, is the Operation thereof: Where they are opposite, the one must give way unto the o∣ther, and that which is most powerful prevails: from whence also the Effects thereof become most visible. The LIGHT notwithstanding, abides always the same, and therefore altho' Man by Sin, thro' his Love and Union to corruptible Things, comes to perish, be damned, and miss of his everlasting Happiness, the <HI>Light</HI> nevertheless which is in <HI>every Man that comes into the World,</HI> abides forever unchangeable.</P>
<P><HI>The Light is also the first Principle of Religion.</HI> For, seeing there can be no true Religion without the Knowledge of God, and no Knowledge of God without this <HI>Light,</HI> Religion must necessarily have this <HI>Light</HI> for its Principle.</P>
<P>God being then known by this <HI>Light,</HI> according to the Measure of Knowledge which the finite and circumscribed Creature can have of the infinite and uncircumscriptible Creator, Man hath obtained a <HI>firm Foundation,</HI> upon which he may build all firm and lasting Things: A Principle whereby he may without ever erring, guide the whole Course of his Life, how he is to carry himself towards God, his Neighbour, and himself, and all Things else, whereby he may happily attain unto his Soul's Salvation, which consisteth only in <HI>Union with God.</HI> And thus this <HI>Light</HI> is therefore the first Principle of Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Without this Light, there is no Power or Ability at all in M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to do any Good.</HI></P>
<P>This must first raise him and quicken him out of the Death of Sin. 'Tis Folly to expect any thing, Where nothing is; there's no Effect with out a Cause: There must be something then which must cause a Man to act, if he does any Thing.</P>
<P>And this Cause must have in it whatsoever the Effect produced hath in it: As for Example, if the Effects of <HI>Light</HI> be produced, <HI>Light</HI> must do it, and nothing else.</P>
<P>And therefore, is it not a silly Thing that all Men would have People do this or that as Good, and leave this or that as Evil, because they tell them so, without any more ado, or at best assigning only the accusto∣mary Motives wherefore, and think they have Reason too, just as if this were enough? Who can see such Effects as are hereby required, included in this Cause? Not I, for my Part.</P>
<P>Experience also teacheth us the same; else how could it all pass a∣way in a Train and Custom, without any Fruit? <HI>These are therefore not the right Means:</HI> But such we must endeavour to furnish People with. Means from whence Power may issue forth to do that which they are exhorted to. Such is the Nature of Man, that he is moved to chuse
<PB N="692" REF="003104_0703_0FEFF9FA4BA00748"/>
that which he judgeth to be best, before the worst, and is always wil∣ling to change for the best.</P>
<P>Now if it so happens (as for the most Part it doth) that a Man chu∣seth the worst before the best, 'tis for want of Knowledge, and contrary to his Aim, and so he erreth, not being led by the <HI>True Light.</HI></P>
<P>Here then it should be begun; 'tis easie leading a Man to that which of himself he is desirous of: If those now who make it their Work to teach others, <HI>were but led themselves by the True Light,</HI> knowing better Things than those to which the Multitude are link'd so fast with Love, they would be able to hold them forth clearly to others: And so making it their continual Work, it were impossible their Labour should be fruitless; for People knowing better, would do better. Who remem∣bers not the Play of our Youth, how much we were in Love therewith, and yet how ridiculous is it now unto us but to think upon it? And why? Because we now know that which we judge better: <HI>Hence,</HI> not by Force, but very lightly, and of it self, they came from Time to Time to be worn out, and pass away, that there is now no Desire nor Motion, moving thereunto. How may we think then it would be, if the Soul came but once to apprehend those Things aright which are durable and uncorruptible, and which infinitely transcend all bodily Toys in Worth? So far as those Things then should come to be esteemed more glorious than all bodily Things, so much the more powerful would be the Annihilation of those Things in which all Men, even to old Age, yea, Death it self, do take so much Delight; and then we might hope and expect that those Things which are (indeed) alone worthy to be known, would gain Entrance, and being brought forth in the <HI>Light,</HI> would be also owned and received by every one, accord∣ing to the Measure in which they should stand in the same <HI>Light.</HI></P>
<P>Hence from within, the Amendment and Conversion is to be waited for, from within it must begin, if with a Foundation; the outward then will follow of it self: The Weakest must give way to the Strongest, all depends but upon the Knowledge of something better, to make a true and lasting Change. Therefore to hold this forth to Men, is the best Thing we can give them.</P>
<P><HI>This Light is the Inward Ear, by which alone, and by no other, the Voice of God,</HI> viz. <HI>the Truth, can be heard.</HI></P>
<P>By this alone must the Sense and Mind of him that would signifie any Thing by Words, or any outward Sign, be comprehended and un∣derstand. <HI>So that if the Truth of God</HI> be presented to a Man who stands not in the <HI>Light of Truth,</HI> 'tis impossible he should understand it, altho' he hears and comprehends the Words after his Manner, yet he is still fenced off from the true Sense and Meaning thereof.</P>
<P>Hence therefore it is, that among so many Hearers there are so few that have Ears to hear.</P>
<P>He that hears <HI>Truth</HI> aright, that is, understands it well, must not stand out of, but in the <HI>Truth</HI> it self.</P>
<P>Therefore neither is it any Wonder that all Men do not understand and conceive those Things that are brought forth by the <HI>Light.</HI> Those only that stand in it are alone (and no other) capable thereof.</P>
<P>The Case being thus, we see of how great Concernment it is conti∣nually to exhort and excite Men to turn in to the <HI>Light</HI> that is in them, that so they may go on to such a Condition and Measure therein, as to be fit to understand aright <HI>the Word,</HI> that is, the <HI>Truth of God,</HI> because out of this there can be nothing understood and concluded from the Words and Writings given forth from the <HI>Light,</HI> but meer Opinions, and consequently Errors, <HI>This Light Christ,</HI> &amp;c. is the <HI>Truth and Word of God,</HI> as hath been already said, and every where appears by what we
<PB N="693" REF="003104_0704_0FEFF9FDD30E0188"/>
have hitherto laid down: <HI>For this is a living Word, and translateth Man from Death to Life, is powerful, and enableth a Man to hear witness of it every where.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This is also the true Rule according unto which all our Actions are to be squared.</HI></P>
<P>This hath the Preheminence before any Writing, Scripture, Doctrine, or any Thing else that we meet with from without. <HI>We are born in∣to the World,</HI> and brought up as every Body knows: From the very first we hear Differences, every one pretends that he knows the Mat∣ter, and hath Truth: One holds forth this, another That to us: <HI>If now the Light which is in every Man that comes into the World,</HI> shall not be Judge, whither shall we rowl? To believe all, is impossible; to reject all, no less: Who shall be judge here? Who else can be but the <HI>Light</HI> within us? For whatsoever comes from without, is the Thing to be judged of: Who then fitter? seeing this is infallible.</P>
<P>Again, is not this (the <HI>Light)</HI> that by which we must see and know God, and so consequently that by which we must judge all Things Di∣vine? Certainly 'tis: Then it follows also, That we can judge of no Doctrine, of no Book that is Divine, but by this <HI>Light;</HI> and judging it thereby to be divine, it cannot but be truly so. As for Example, if we experience that the Book called the BIBLE, in regard of tne Divine Doctrine therein comprised, hath such an <HI>Harmony with that in which God</HI> is known, that he must needs have been the Author of it; there cannot rationally any more powerful Demonstration be demanded. With them that are thus, <HI>the Scripture may become living and powerful, and not a dead Letter,</HI> as it must needs be to those Men who have no Feeling of this Thing. And from hence then it is apparent, seeing this Light must be preferred to all Things whatsoever that we meet with from with∣out, that then <HI>Man must first of all be directed to this:</HI> For without it what Profit is there (I pray) to be reaped any where by any external Sign but by it. Lay the Book of the Scripture freely before any Man, let him also have all the Fitness (the Universities can give him) to look into it in its proper Language in which it may have first been written, what will all be without the <HI>Light?</HI> Nothing. <HI>The Letters, the Words are not the Scriptures,</HI> but the Mind alone is the Scripture, and this Meaning can never be truly and justly hit, but by those alone that stand in the same <HI>Light,</HI> out of which the Scriptures proceeded.</P>
<P>These are they then to whom the Scripture is a <HI>Co-witness,</HI> and as a Seal of their being Sons of God; while by Experience they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them∣selves, every one according to his Measure, in the <HI>same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in which the Saints formerly were,</HI> who spake and writ all those Things comprehended in the Book of the Scripture; <HI>these then have the true Understanding and Meaning of the Scriptures,</HI> not those that <HI>imagine unto themselves a Meaning</HI> by Opinion and Guess, thro' a thousand Ima∣ginations, without the least Assurance of not erring; which becomes the very Ground of all Jangling and Contention.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>This Light in every Man is the Means to come to the Know∣ledge of God.</HI> And seeing all external Signs must needs presuppose this Knowledge, therefore itself must needs be immediate, without any ex∣ternal Sign: That Signs must presuppose such a Knowledge, is undeni∣able: for these Signs must either be <HI>Words or Effects, Works or Miracles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Words,</HI> we see at first an Impossibility in the Thing it self: For <HI>Words are created and finite,</HI> and God who should make known himself by them, <HI>uncreated and infinite:</HI> And therefore here is so infinite a Dif∣ference, that there is no <HI>Manner</HI> of Agreement, nor any <HI>Thing</HI> in the Words by which they might be capable to do it. But again, if you fly to the <HI>Meaning</HI> of the Words, as being fit for such a Thing, then that which we say will more manifestly appear: As put case for Example∣sake,
<PB N="694" REF="003104_0705_0FEFFA019E385018"/>
that GOD about to make known himself by Words, should say, I AM GOD, and that this should be the Sign by which he would make himself known, we see clearly, that it would be impossible for a Man at first to know God by this; For if he should comprehend any Thing out of the Sense of the Words, he must needs formerly have had the Signification of the Word GOD, and what he is to understand by it: In like Manner, if God maketh his Will known to Man, <HI>the Knowledge of God</HI> (which hath its Original from the <HI>True Light) must precede and convince him,</HI> that that (Manifestation) can be from none but God alone, whereupon he is then sufficiently assured.</P>
<P>If by <HI>Effects</HI> (or <HI>outward miraculous Works)</HI> 'tis the same Thing; for these are no less <HI>created,</HI> no less <HI>finite:</HI> And tho' we might observe something in the Nature of a Thing, which might be too difficult for the Power of any Creature, which we know, to effect; yet this at the utmost would be but a Demonstration taken from our <HI>Impotency</HI> and not from <HI>the Nature and all the Operations of it;</HI> and this Kind of De∣monstration cannot be certain and stable, till we were able clearly and distinctly to see that there was <HI>not a Concurrency of many Causes</HI> to pro∣duce such an Effect, but that it must needs have been caused by an <HI>in∣finite and unlimited Cause,</HI> whom we call God: But who knoweth this? Or who can declare it?</P>
<P>Add to this, <HI>That the Knwoledge of God in all Things must first be, be∣fore the Knowledge of any Creature</HI> or particular Thing; so that no par∣ticular Thing without this can be well known; and consequently is altogether uncapable to come to know God by, or certainly to make known himself to Man by.</P>
<P>Go to then, <HI>Without</HI> thy self, O Man, thou hast no Means to look for, by which thou mayest know God. <HI>Thou must abide within thy self, to the Light that is in thee</HI> thou must turn thee, there thou wilt find it, And no where else.</P>
<P>God is, <HI>considered</HI> in himself, <HI>nearest unto thee and every Man.</HI> He that goes forth of himself to any Creature, thereby to know God, de∣parts from God, and so much the further, an he comes more to admire the Creature, and stand in Contemplation thereof, to mistake himself by it, This thou must then <HI>shun</HI> and the contrary <HI>mind,</HI> viz. <HI>Mind the Light that is in thee,</HI> by it to work, unmoveably and faithfully to persevere.</P>
