<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T hath pleased the sovereign and gracious God, <HI>in whose Hand our Times are,</HI> to or∣dain that we should live under some peculiar Advan∣tages for our precious Souls. For to the <HI>ordinary Means,</HI> we have super-added the Manifestation of the Spirit, in <HI>extraordinary Works</HI> of Grace. We have lately heard glad Tidings from one Place &amp; another, that many are en∣quiring the Way to Zion, with their Fa∣ces thitherward; and some are decla∣ring what God hath done for their Souls. Yea, God hath brought this Work home to our own Doors, &amp; we hear many cry∣ing out, <HI>What must we do to be saved.</HI> And There are a Number hopefully rejoicing in God's Salvation. Of such a Season as this it may well be said, <HI>I have heard thee in a Time accepted, and in the Day of Salva∣tion have I succoured thee: behold, Now is the accepted Time; Behold, Now is the Day of Salvation,</HI> I hope God's People are
<PB N="ii" REF="004803_0002_100DF1DEFA4FC7B8"/>
reaping the Fruit of their Prayers, par∣ticularly on extraordinary Days of Fast∣ing observ'd with an especial View to this great Blessing, the plentiful Effusion of the holy Spirit And shall we not prize and improve this rich Gift? Shall we not redeem this precious Time in work∣ing out our own Salvation? considering that God who alone can work in us to will and to do, says to us, <HI>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call upon him while he is near. To Day, if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI> Certain∣ly we must be very criminal if we sleep or loiter away such a Day of Grace. They who are guilty of such a presump∣tuous Sin, run a dreadful Hazard of swift Destruction, double Damnation. O there's great Reason to fear that another like Season will never, never return up∣on you. O Sleeper! Awake, &amp; hearken, there's a Noise, and a Shaking among the dry Bones. Some it may be of your own Acquaintance, secure like you a little while ago, are now in deep Con∣cern, &amp; can no longer relish those car∣nal Pleasures in which you were Com∣panions. Now, Destruction from God is a Terror to them, and they are
<PB N="iii" REF="004803_0002_100DF1DEFA4FC7B8"/>
fleeing from the Wrath to come. What a Reproof doth God give to your Stu∣pidity in the Awakenings of others? Now then hear God's Voice, <HI>Turn ye at my Reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spi∣rit unto you.</HI> Or, if you are still deaf to God's Calls, let the Thunder of those amazing Words make your Ears to tin∣gle; <HI>Because I have called, and ye have refused,— I also will laugh at your Cala∣mity, and mock when your fear cometh. When your Fear cometh as Desolation, and your De∣struction as a Whirlwind.</HI> And tremble least you should be suddenly destroy∣ed, and that without Remedy. But then, Let awakened Sinners be en∣couraged to press into the Kingdom of Heaven. Strive to enter in at the strait Gate; for many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. Improve the Five Talents now put into your Hands, re∣membring what our Lord hath said, <HI>Un∣to whom much is given, of him shall much be required.</HI> O look diligently, lest any Man fail of the Grace of God! Continue seeking till Christ be revealed to you as the Lord your Righteousness, and as the God of Judgment: That you may glory in this, that you understand, &amp; know the
<PB N="iv" REF="004803_0003_100DF1E19B6970D8"/>
Lord, who exerciseth Loving-kindness, Judgment &amp; Righteousness in the Earth. And here, among you with whom the Spirit is striving at this Day, we behold many of our young People. O our Chil∣dren! God is drawing nigh to you in a distinguishing manner, and will not you from this Time cry unto him <HI>My Father, thou art the Guide of my Youth?</HI> Shall any of you be prosane as <HI>Esau,</HI> who for one Morsel of Meat sold his Birth-right; and then, when he would have inheri∣ted the Blessing, was rejected? God for∣bid. May you all thirst for God, and seek him early, till that Promise shall be more abundantly fulfilled in you, <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed and my Blessing on thine Offspring.</HI> And is it possible for Parents &amp; elder Persons to behold these Things, and not be moved? Can you see your Children in Pain, and travailing till Christ be formed in them, and you be unconcern'd about the New-Birth? Are they taken, and can you bear to be left behind; left to perish in your Sins, as far distant as Heaven &amp; Hell? Is the eleventh Hour running, and you not effectually called? What a sad Token is this! The Lord have Mercy upon you!
<PB N="v" REF="004803_0003_100DF1E19B6970D8"/>
But there are considerable Numbers of elder as well as younger Persons, of whom I am perswaded better Things, and Things that accompany Salva∣tion. And to you our ascended Sa∣viour speaks, <HI>Hold fast till I come.</HI> Be not ashamed or afraid, to confess Christ before Men; &amp; to stand up for him. And here the Providence of God gives me Advantage to press upon you that Ex∣hortation; If ye are risen with Christ, <HI>seek those Things which are above;</HI> set your Affection on things above, not on things on the Earth. For as it was with God's ancient People, <HI>a Day of Darkness and Gloominess,</HI> and then God comforted his People with that gracious Promise, <HI>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joel 2</NOTE> So it pleaseth God to send down the Com∣forter from Heaven into the Hearts of his People, while it is a dark Day with us upon temporal Accounts. May the Spirit of Judgment sanctify the Frowns of God upon us to rebuke our Pride, our Covetousness, our Luxury; and all those foolish and hurtful Lusts, whereby we have been conformed to this World. And now we be∣hold, the Curse devouring the Earth,
<PB N="vi" REF="004803_0004_100DF1E337D08360"/>
may we all unite in seeking the Blessings of the heavenly Paradise, where Satan &amp; the Curse can never enter. That we may even now say with the Prophet, <HI>Altho' the Fig-Tree shall not blossom—and the Fields shall yield no Meat, the Flock shall be cut off from the Fold, and there shall be no Herd in the Stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>But I forbear, and would only further say, that the remarkable Work of Grace begun and going on among us, gave Encouragement to me to study and preach the following Sermons. At first, I design'd to publish only upon the Head of Conviction of Sin, the Dis∣courses upon which Subject it pleased God to own and bless much beyond my Expectation. May the Praise be given to that God who hath chosen the weak Things of the World, that no Flesh should glory in his Presence. Since that, I have been prevail'd upon to go on with the Subject, and also to publish the other Discourses; that we may see in some measure how the Spirit of God carrieth on his good Work in the Hearts of his People from legal Conviction to saving Conversion, and then sends forth Judgment to Victory, not withs∣tanding all Opposition from the Enemies of our Salvation. Sensible of the Defects which attend this Performance, I humbly commend it to God for His Blessing, beseeching him to teach us to Profit by all the Means of Grace which he gives us richly to enjoy.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N my last Turn at this Lec∣ture, I consider'd our Lord JESUS CHRIST as <HI>exalted to be a Prince, and a Savi∣our, to give Repentance to Israel and Forgiveness of Sins;</HI> from Acts 5.31. I now proceed to shew you the great and comprehensive Gift which our
<PB N="2" REF="004803_0005_100DF1E4D61D7FC0"/>
Lord receiv'd of the Father, when he ascen∣ded on high, the Gift of the HOLY SPIRIT, by whom He works Faith and Repentance in the Hearts of his People, and so prepa∣reth them for all the Blessings of the Gos∣pel. And here our Lord assureth us that his Disciples, and so his Churches would be great Gainers by his withdraw from them on Earth, to his exalted State in Heaven; for then, and not till then, should the Spirit be given in a more plentiful and extensive manner, in virtue of CHRIST'S Intercession at the Father's Right Hand; and that to make Application of the Redemption purchas'd by Him, and to communicate all spiritual Bles∣sings to his People, <HI>Ver. 7 Nevertheless, I tell you the Truth, It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him into you.</HI> Accor∣dingly we also read, that the <HI>Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not, yet glorified.</HI> And we have the fulfilment of our Saviours Promise, Acts 2.4. v. <HI>They were all filled with the Holy Ghost,</HI> in mira∣culous Gifts, particularly the Gift of Tongues, whereby the Apostle, were qualified to preach the Gospel to other Nations. And the Spi∣rit of GOD was also pour'd out in an ex∣traordinary manner as a Spirit of Grace and Consolation, 41, 42, v. <HI>Then they that gladly
<PB N="3" REF="004803_0005_100DF1E4D61D7FC0"/>
received his Word were baptized: and the same Day there were added unto them about three thousand Souls. And they continued sted∣fastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread and in Prayers.</HI> But I return to the Text, in which we have the Errand on which the Holy Ghost is sent, and the Work he should perform in virtue of his Mission, described. For tho' the Three Persons in the adorable Trinity are <HI>One</HI> in the essential Perfections of the divine Nature, yet in the Covenant of Redemption, the Son voluntarily agreeth to fulfill the Father's Will by taking our Nature in the fulness of Time, and purchasing eternal Salva∣tion for his People; and the Holy Spirit en∣gageth that the saving Benefits of this Re∣demption shall be applied to all whom the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, hath chosen in him before the Foundation of the World, that they should be holy, and without blame before him in love. Agre∣ably it is here said, And when he is come, he will reprove, <HI>&amp;c. When he is come,</HI> i. e. In the peculiar Manifestations of his gracious Presence; for in his divine Essence, the Spirit is immense and omnipresent. <HI>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit,</HI> Psal. 139.7. <HI>He will reprove the World of Sin,</HI>—Not only Jews but Gentiles. Possibly some may be stumbled that the Spirit is call'd the Comforter, and
<PB N="4" REF="004803_0006_100DF1E69548DA40"/>
then it is said that he should Reprove. But now, the Word is of a larger Signification, it signifieth <HI>Advocate,</HI> and is thus translated by <HI>Beza.</HI> We have the same Word appli∣ed to Christ, 1 Joh. 2.1. And accordingly, the Spirit is call'd <HI>another Comforter</HI> or Ad∣vocate, Joh. 14.16. When our Lord ascended to appear in the Presence of God for his People, and transact their Affairs in the Court of Heaven as their Advocate with the Father; He sent his holy Spirit to ma∣nage the Affairs of the Kingdom of Grace here upon Earth. And this Work of con∣vincing Men of Sin well suits with this Cha∣racter of an Advocate. As such the Spirit of God shews Sinners that the Charge laid against them in God's Word is just, that the World may become guilty before God and that Sinners self-condemned may seek Justification by the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, and so be prepared for the Joy of God's Salvation. And this agreeth also with the Word here translated <HI>Reprove,</HI> which signifieth to convince by evident Argument and solid Reason. "I will convince them of their Sins, and after reprove, admonish and check them for the same" And there's then a particular Sin mentioned, Cont. v. 9 <HI>Of Sin, because they believe not in me.</HI> The hainous Sin of the <HI>Jews</HI> in that Day was that they rejected Jesus Christ the <HI>Messiah</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004803_0006_100DF1E69548DA40"/>
promised to their Fathers and sent to them as the only Name whereby they could be saved. <HI>He came unto his own, and his own received him not, Joh. 1.11.</HI> Saving a Rem∣nant according to the Election of Grace. <HI>Because of unbelief, they were broken off,</HI> Rom. 11.20. Accordingly when the Spirit of God was poured out and <HI>Peter</HI> preached to them, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. He charg'd them home with the great Sin of rejecting and crucifying the Lord of Glory; upon which many are pricked to the Heart, and say in deep Con∣cern, <HI>Men and Brethren, What shall we do?</HI> 37. v. And doth not this Sin of Unbelief much prevail in this Age? Many seem to be insensible how great the Evil of this Sin is, tho' the Word of God declareth, that <HI>He who believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son,</HI> 1 Joh 5.10. It's to be fear'd that there are many under the Gospel, who satisfy themselves with an out∣ward Attendance on religious Duties, while they refuse to submit to Christ, and neg∣lect his great Salvation. But now, when the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, He will shew them the great Evil of an Heart of Unbelief, and make them sensible of this, that <HI>he who believeth not the Son, shall not see Life; but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> Again, The Spirit reproveth of
<PB N="6" REF="004803_0007_100DF1E8AF007498"/>
<HI>Righteousness.</HI> He will convince Men that <HI>Jesus</HI> who suffered an accursed Death as if he had been the vilest Malefactor, being cru∣cified between two Thieves, is indeed the <HI>just One;</HI> and suffered the Just for the Un∣just, that he is the Lord our Righteousness. He will convince Sinners that they can't be justified but by the Righteousness of Christ received by Faith. Now his going to the Father was a Demonstration of this, that he was Jesus Christ the Righteous, and had ful∣filled all Righteousness. — <HI>And of Judg∣ment.</HI> That all Judgment is committed to the Son as Lord and Christ, and that he hath Power as Mediator and in virtue of His O∣bedience unto Death, to cast down Satan from his usurped Throne, and deliver poor Sinners from his destoying Power. Agre∣ably where our Saviour speaks of his being litted up upon the Cross, He says, <HI>Now is the Judgment of this World: Now shall the Prince of this World be cast out,</HI> Joh. 12.31.</P>
<P>Having thus explained the Words of my Text, I return to consider that Part which I purpose more particularly to speak to; the Work of the Spirit in reproving Men of Sin.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>IT is the Work of the Holy Spirit, to con∣vince and reprove Men of Sin.</Q>
<P>The Spirit of God is the great Dispen∣ser of common and saving Grace. There is a <HI>saving Conviction</HI> of Sin, which the Spirit of God works in the Hearts of Men when he enlightens them to discern spiritual Things after a spiritual manner. When God gives them the Light of the Knowledge of his Glory, they see that Evil in Sin as it is con∣trary to him, his Nature and revealed Will, which causes them to mourn for it with that godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance to Salvation. <HI>Now mine Eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abbor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes,</HI> Job 42.5, 6. They look unto Jesus as pierced by their Sins and mourn, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. Thus it is when the Spirit of Grace converts Men, and turns them from Sin to God, by working a saving Change in their Hearts. And there is a <HI>legal Con∣viction</HI> which the Spirit of God works in the Hearts of Men before Conversion, whereby they are awakened out of their carnal Secu∣rity in Sin, and bro't under deep Concern about Deliverance from it as a destroying Evil. Now it is a matter of the greatest Im∣portance to such as are under this Work,
<PB N="8" REF="004803_0008_100DF1EA8A470AE0"/>
that it be carried on till it issue in a saving Conversion to God. For the divine Spirit, who acts with sovereign Liberty, may be provok'd to depart, and leave Men to perish in their Sins. Thus the Spirit of God strove with the Sinners of the old World, whose departed Spirits are call'd <HI>Spirits in Prison,</HI> 1 Pet. 3, 19. Their Bodies were destroy'd by the Flood, and their Souls are now shut up in Hell, Where they are kept in durance to the Judgment of the great Day. And indeed it is plain from Scripture that these lower Workings of the Spirit, if I may so call them, have been in some preparatory to saving Conversion, while others have stifled them. I shall give you an Instance of each from the Word of God, to awaken your Hopes and Fears, the great Springs of hu∣man Endeavours. The rough and hardy <HI>Jaylor</HI> came trembling, and fell down before <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> saying, Sirs, <HI>What must I to be saved?</HI> They answer, <HI>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be save</HI> And it seems the Spirit soon converted him even that same Night; yea gave him the Joy of God's Salvation. <HI>He rejoyced, be∣lieving in God with all his House,</HI> Acts 16 29,— 34. O that this may be the happy Case of the many now under Convictions! <HI>Felix</HI> also trembled, as <HI>Paul</HI> reasoned of Righte∣ousness, Temperance, and Judgment to come
<PB N="9" REF="004803_0008_100DF1EA8A470AE0"/>
<HI>Acts</HI> 24.25. Behold the Judge quaking for Fear before his Prisoner! We may well sup∣pose a greater than <HI>Paul</HI> was there, even the <HI>Judge of all the Earth,</HI> reproving this Man for his Crimes by the Spirit accompanying <HI>Paul's</HI> faithful Ministry: But then he un∣happily endeavour'd to put off his Convicti∣ons by saying to <HI>Paul, Go thy way for this Time; when I have a convenient Season, I will call for thee.</HI> And for ought any thing that appears, the Spirit ceased striving with him. We read indeed that <HI>Felix</HI> sent for <HI>Paul</HI> again; but not to hear the Word of God, and inquire how he should improve his Con∣victions; but because he hoped that Money should have been given him of <HI>Paul,</HI> that he might loose him, v. 26. A base Thing in∣deed! And after two Years, to shew the <HI>Jews</HI> a Pleasure, he left <HI>Paul</HI> bound, v. 27, Upon the whole, it is highly probable, that the convenient Season, he pretended to wait for, never came. O it is a dangerous Thing to resist the Spirit of God striving with us, and as it were bid him depart from us!</P>
<P>I would now speak particularly to the Doctrine under these following Heads;</P>
<P N="1">I. The Holy Spirit is the Author of this Work of Conviction, II. We may consider the Means he useth to convince Men of
<PB N="10" REF="004803_0009_100DF1ECDA7A1768"/>
Sin. <HI>III.</HI> Offer some Description of this Work of Conviction.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I. THE Holy Spirit is the Author of this Work of Conviction.</HI></P>
<P>That there is such a Work going before and preparatory to saving Conversion in God's chosen People, is evident from Scrip∣ture and Experience. The Son of Man is come to seek and save that which was lost; and the <HI>Prodigal Son</HI> is represented as sen∣sible of his perishing Condition, before he resolveth to <HI>arise and go to his Father,</HI>— Luke 15.17, 18. And our compassionate Redeemer inviteth them that <HI>labor and are heavy laden to come to him for rest,</HI> Matth. 11.28. And we find from Examples upon Record in Scripture, as well as of later Date down to our own Times, that God takes this Course with Men, convincing them of Sin and bringing them under a deep Con∣cern about their Souls before he grants them the Joy of his Salvation. Now whatever <HI>Instruments</HI> may be used in this Work, we must acknowledge that the Spirit of God is the <HI>great Efficient.</HI> He striveth with Men, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. And accordingly <HI>Stephen</HI> charged his Hearers with the great Sin of resisting the Holy Ghost, <HI>Act.</HI> 7.51. How sharp were his Arrows in their Hearts who heard <HI>Peter's</HI> Sermon upon occasion of the
<PB N="11" REF="004803_0009_100DF1ECDA7A1768"/>
wonderful Effusion of the Holy Ghost in the Day of <HI>Pentecost: Act.</HI> 2. They were <HI>prick∣ed in their Heart,</HI> 37. <HI>v.</HI> And in a little Time seem to have been subdued to the Obedience of Faith. Agreably, the Spirit of God is called a Spirit of Bondage, Rom. 8.15. <HI>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bon∣dage again to fear.</HI> Indeed the holy Spirit can't be the Author of Sin whereby Men are brought into Bondage; but then He makes Sinners sensible of this cruel Bondage, and brings them to groan after Deliverance.</P>
<P N="2">II. We proceed to consider the Means which the Spirit of God useth to con∣vince Men of Sin.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THE great Instrument is the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly the Word is call'd the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> Eph. 6.17. <HI>All Scrip∣ture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor∣rection,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16. But then the same Spirit that moved those holy Men who wrote the Scriptures, must accompany them with his divine Influence; or there will be sad Occasion to take up that Lamentation, <HI>Who hath believed our Report? and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</HI> Isa. 58.1. When the Spirit is withdrawn, we find that the Ministry of the Word has little
<PB N="12" REF="004803_0010_100DF1EEF5E5A350"/>
or no good Effect upon the Hearts of Sin∣ners. They are unmov'd as the Seats they sit upon: Their Ears are heavy and their Eyes shut, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.10. But when this almigh∣ty Spirit is pleas'd to take his Word into his own Hand, and wound the Sinners Con∣science with it, he can no longer make light of the Commands or Threatnings; they come home to him, and reach his very Heart: <HI>He is convinced of all, he is judged of all,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.23. He is convinced of the Sins where∣by he hath transgressed God's holy Law, and his Heart condemneth him for them. Now the Word of God <HI>is quick, and pow∣erful, and sharper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow, and is a Discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,</HI> Heb. 4.12. The Law of God is call'd a <HI>fiery Law,</HI> Deut. 33.2. And it may well be so call'd, not only as it was de∣liver'd out of the midst of the Fire, from the burning Mountain; but also, as in it we have God's burning Wrath, and fiery Indignation against Sinners revealed from Heaven. Ac∣cordingly when the Word of God is ac∣companied with the Spirit, and so comes with Power upon the Hearts of Sinners, they feel Pain and Anguish, and are sensible of the deadly Wounds Sin hath given them. <HI>Is not my Word like as a Fire, saith the Lord:
<PB N="13" REF="004803_0010_100DF1EEF5E5A350"/>
and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rock in Pieces?</HI> Jer. 23.29. When the Spirit takes it into his Hand, he breaks the Sin∣ners carnal Confidences. By the <HI>Law</HI> is the <HI>Knowlege of Sin,</HI> and by it the Spirit reproves Men for their Sins, and convinceth them of their lost perishing Condition as Transgressors of God's Law. So sharp and cutting were God's Reproofs of his ancient People by his Word in the Mouth of his holy Prophets, that he says, <HI>Therefore have I hewed them by the Prophets: I have slain them by the Words of my Mouth,</HI> Hos. 6.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Holy Spirit convinceth and re∣proveth Men of Sin by <HI>God's providential Dispensations, particularly by afflictive Pro∣vidences.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes the Holy Spirit makes use of the divine Goodness to lead Sinners to Repen∣tance, Rom, 2.4. And draweth them as with the Cords of a Man, and Bands of Love. A∣greably it is promis'd that the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> should <HI>fear the Lord, and his Goodness</HI> in the latter Days, <HI>Hos</HI> 3.5. But I am now considering the Reproof given by Afflicti∣ons. When Sinners resist the Spirit speak∣ing to them in and by his Word, he some∣times takes the Rod, and teacheth them as <HI>Gideon</HI> taught the Men of <HI>Succoth</HI> with Briars and Thorns of the Wilderness. And when they are thus torn and wounded, they are bro't to consider what an evil Thing Sin
<PB N="14" REF="004803_0011_100DF1F1DD983F88"/>
is, and their need of a Saviour to deliver them from it. Thus God said to his anci∣ent People by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah. Thine own Wickedness shall correct thee, and thy Back∣slidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see, that it is an evil Thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.</HI> Chap. 2.9. Outward Prosperity is apt to make Men careless and secure; to say with the Church of the <HI>Laodiceans, I am rich, and increased with Goods, and have need of nothing.</HI> But now, When God brings Men into Straits and under Difficulties, He sometimes awakeneth them to a serious Re∣flection upon their spiritual Poverty, Misery and Wretchedness, <HI>I spake unto thee in thy Prosperity, but thou saidst, I will not hear: this hath been thy manner from thy Youth, that thou obeyedst not my Voice. The Wind shall eat up all thy Pastors, and thy Lovers shall go into Captivity, surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy Wicked∣ness,</HI> Jer. 22.21, 2. And thus it was with <HI>Ephraim</HI> when he bore the Reproach of the Sins of his Youth under God's Chastisements, Jer. 31.18. <HI>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a Bullock unaccustomed to the Yoke: turn thou me and I shall be turn∣ed; for thou art the Lord my God.</HI> Tho' these Words nextly refer to God's People,
<PB N="15" REF="004803_0011_100DF1F1DD983F88"/>
they may be fitly applied to particular Persons. When God corrects Men, and by his Spirit opens their Ears to Discipline, he shaws them the Necessity of their turning to God, and maketh them concern'd to obtain convert∣ing Grace. <HI>Turn thou me</HI>—. O that this may be the happy Case of the many young People who are under Convictions at this Time! <HI>Dear Children!</HI> Ask the Spirit of Grace as a Spirit of Regeneration and Adop∣tion, that you may have your weary Souls reviv'd with that good Word which follow∣eth, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>Is Ephraim a dear Son? is he a pleasant Child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my Bowels are troubled for him: I will sure∣ly have Mercy upon him, saith the Lord.</HI> But to return, When Persons are secure, God cometh upon them, takes away their Health, and brings them seriously to consider their latter End. God shaketh me over the Grave, says the awakened Sinner, and what will be∣come of me, if I die in my Sins, if I die out of Christ? Again, God comes &amp; taketh away their earthly Goods, and so convinceth them of the Evil of trusting in uncertain Riches, and awakens them to seek that good Part which can't be taken away. Again, God bereaveth Men of their near and dear Friends, and so quickens them to seek the Favour and Friendship of the eternal God, making them taste the Bitterness of Sin as it hath brought
<PB N="16" REF="004803_0012_100DF1F43B651BD0"/>
Death into the World, and shewing them the Vanity of Creatures. We read of those Sinners, Psal. 78.34, 5. <HI>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they re∣membred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer.</HI> And was it not thus with this People in the Time of the EARTH∣QUAKE, when God threatned to send us down quick into the Pit? Did not Multi∣tudes tremble as the <HI>Jailor,</HI> and inquire with great Concern, what must we do to be saved? How did People flock to God's House, and with what aw did they attend to his Word, while the Foundations of the Earth were shaken under us! Yea, I humbly apprehend that there is Reason to believe that the mighty Voice uttered from the deep Pla∣ces of the Earth, together with the still Voice of God's Word, was sanctified not only for the Conviction, but also for the Convension of Numbers of People, by the Spirit of God. So far as we can judge, there were a Num∣ber, whom the Terrors of that dreadful Night awakened, whom the Spirit effectually call'd. While it is to be fear'd that the Im∣pressions made on a far greater Number wore off, and dyed away. I the rather men∣tion this remarkable Providence, because I apprehend that the Time of it was a Season in which God was pleased in a general and extraordinary manner to strive with this
<PB N="17" REF="004803_0012_100DF1F43B651BD0"/>
People. Since that we have been visited with a very mortal Sickness, in which God hath cut off many of our Children; but I cannot learn that People have been awakened in any Proportion to the exceeding Awful∣ness of the Judgment.</P>
<P N="3">3. The holy Spirit makes use of <HI>His Works of Grace to convince and awaken Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>At sometimes the Spirit is awfully restrain'd, and then Conversions are rare and doubtful. At other Seasons, God is pleas'd to pour out His Spirit upon his People, and then his Works of Grace, are as the Light which goeth forth. Many ask the Way to <HI>Zion,</HI> with their Faces thitherward, and not a few declare God's Works of Grace towards them with rejoicing. Convictions and Conversions become more frequent and apparent, so far as our Judg∣ment reacheth. It is true, the saving Con∣version of others can't be certainly known by us in the ordinary Way, because we are not able to look directly into the Heart, but must judge by outward Appearances. And there∣fore we ought to exercise Judgment with Charity. But then there are sometimes Fruits of the Spirit so evident, that they can't be conceal'd or denied. There is the <HI>Mani∣festation of the Spirit</HI> in his divine Operations. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.7. Persons that were before quiet in their Sins and unconcerned, are so awakened that they can't stifle their Convictions, nor
<PB N="18" REF="004803_0013_100DF1F5DCC3DC70"/>
conceal their Distress; but are made to cry out, <HI>What shall we do?</HI> How shall we escape the Wrath to come? And when a Son or Daughter, or any other in a Family are thus wrought upon, the House is alarm'd with it, and thus their Friends and Acquain∣tants are happily press'd with Concern a∣bout their own Souls by the Convictions of o∣thers, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to use them as Means for this End. And when such a Work of Grace spreads and increa∣seth thro' the good Hand of God upon his People, it will be still more observable, and such as are considerate, will be ready to say admiring, What hath God wrought! Yea, all that behold it, must now see, if they will open their Eyes, that there's more in Reli∣gion than a lifeless Formality, and outward Attendance on Ordinances. When the Work of God is thus reviv'd among a Peo∣ple, the Form of Godliness will be animated with the inward Life and Power of it. God's own Children will be quicken'd to arise and trim their Lamps, that their Light may shine before others. And such as were Strangers to Religion before, will now press into the Kingdom of Heaven. That Description well agreeth to such a Season. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force,</HI> Matth. 11 12. The Mini∣sters of Christ will be encouraged and enli∣vened in their Work, and such as are un∣der
<PB N="19" REF="004803_0013_100DF1F5DCC3DC70"/>
Convictions will be awakened to a more diligent Attendance on the Word and Ordi∣nances. Now such things as these, under the Influence of the blessed Spirit, must have an happy tendency to rouse the sleepy secure Sinner, and reprove him for his cri∣minal Indifferency in the great Concerns of his Soul. And thus the holy Spirit maketh use of the Works of his Grace to convince Men of their Sin and Danger, while they behold a great Alteration in others for the better; but have not felt the like in them∣selves. That God who formeth the Spirit of Man within him, hath <HI>fashioned their Hearts alike;</HI> so that as in Water, Face answereth to Face; <HI>so the Heart of Man to Man.</HI> Psal, 33.15. Prov. 27.29. Whence ariseth a kind of Sympathy and Affection respecting each other; so that what toucheth the one; af∣fecteth the other. And this is in an espe∣cial manner observable in such as are near and dear to each other. When the Child is in Distress, the tender Parent is presently touched with the feeling of it's Sorrow: When the Brother crieth out in Anguish of Soul, the kind Sister can't forbear to con∣dole with him. Accordingly, When it plea∣seth the holy Spirit to use these Inclinations and Affections in Men as Means, good im∣pression, by the divine Blessing, wonderfully propagate and multiply. This I find observ'd by a Reverend and dear Brother, in his <HI>Nar∣rative</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="004803_0014_100DF1F7FB56A4B0"/>
of the surprising Work of God in the Conversion of many hundred Souls in <HI>North∣hampton,</HI> and the neighbouring Towns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> "There is no one Thing that I know of that God has made such a Means of promo∣ting His Work amongst us, as the News of others Conversion; in the awakening Sin∣ners, and engaging them earnestly to seek the same Blessing, and in the quickening of Saints."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Mr. Edward's <HI>Narrative,</HI> P. 39.</NOTE> And as more lately, we have receiv'd <HI>good News</HI> of this kind from more distant Places upon this Continent; so I can't but hope that God's sending one and another of his Servants among us who had been perso∣nally acquainted with these later wonderful Works of Grace, together with their very laborious and fervent Preaching, and the Mi∣nistry of others his Servants; has been bles'd to convince many of their Sins, and awaken them to a serious Concern about their Souls. Yea, It is hopeful that there are a Number converted, and brought home to Christ. Let us give the Praise to the God of all Grace: And let Pastors and Parents, and other Chri∣stians in their several Places use their best Endeavours to forward this good Work; for tho' the Work is the Lord's, and he alone can carry it on with victorious Success; yet he delights to use his People as Instruments,
<PB N="21" REF="004803_0014_100DF1F7FB56A4B0"/>
and expects that in the way of Duty they ask His Blessing in the more plentiful and extensive Effusions of his Spirit. Thus when God had promised to give his People a <HI>new Heart; to put his Spirit within them,</HI> and cause them to walk in his Statutes: He adds, <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of by the House of Israel, to do it for them,</HI> Ezek. 36.37.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> The 3d Head is <HI>to give some Descrip∣tion of this Work of the Spirit in Con∣viction.</HI></P>
<P>I shall at present, only observe a few Things in general relating to it,</P>
<P>This Work of the Spirit is by Divines commonly call'd <HI>Preparatory,</HI> as it goeth be∣fore saving Conversion, and is wrought in order to it, respecting such as are afterwards effectually call'd by the Spirit. By this Work, says the excellent Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> "We under∣stand certain inherent Qualifications, coming between the carnal Rest of the Soul in the State of Sin, and Conversion wrought in the Ministry both of the Law and Gospel, by the common Work of the Spirit concurring; whereby the Soul is put into a ministerial Capacity of believing immediately, <HI>i. e.</HI> of immediate receiving the Lord Jesus Christ." This is the order in which God proceeds in the Work of his Grace on the Souls of such as are grown to Years of Understanding: He maketh them sensible of their Sin and Misery,
<PB N="22" REF="004803_0015_100DF1FA10543CA0"/>
and so brings them to seek <HI>Jesus</HI> who saveth his People from their Sins, and to submit to him. Indeed this Work is neither the effi∣cient nor meretorious Cause of their saving Conversion; however in this Way God a∣wakeneth his People to a diligent Attendance on the Means of Grace, till he shall work in them to will and to do, and make them his <HI>willing People, in the Day of his Power.</HI> And here, we may observe that we must not presume to limit and restrain the infinite Spirit of God in this matter, who is call'd the <HI>free Spirit,</HI> Psal. 51.12. No doubt there may be great Variety as to Degrees of Terror, as to the Time Persons are kept under it, and the like. And we must take heed that in this respect we do not make our particular Expe∣riences general Rules to judge of the State of Men <HI>God opened the Heart of Lydia,</HI> and the <HI>Jailor came trembling</HI> with the ut∣most Consternation. And it hath been ob∣served that some have been kept under a Spi∣rit of Bondage for a considerable Time, while other convinced Sinners have been in a short Time surpris'd with a Visit from the holy Spirit of God as a Spirit of Adoption, which supposeth the New-Birth. Again, as to out∣ward Expressions of deep Concern in Tears, wringing the Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Persons under like inward deep Concern of Mind may conside∣rably differ according to different Constitu∣tions and Tempers. Again, Some may have
<PB N="23" REF="004803_0015_100DF1FA10543CA0"/>
been more hainous Transgressors than others, and God may impress their Minds with ter∣rible Fears in some Proportion. Again, It's no improbable Supposition, that some have been converted in early Childhood before they were capable of giving a distinct Ac∣count of this Work. Nor need it seem strange, if such as have been favour'd with a pious Education and good Impressions from their Childhood, should be more at a loss in this Matter, than such as have been suddenly surpris'd as <HI>Saul,</HI> while going on in open Rebellion against God, and so knock'd down under the fearful Apprehensions of his Wrath, and then rais'd with the wonderful Manifesta∣tions of the free Grace of God in Jesus Christ super-abounding where Sin had abounded. Therefore such as find upon strict and im∣partial Examination, that they abhor them∣selves for Sin as it is contrary to the declarative Glory &amp; revealed Will of God, and so turn from all Sin unto God, as their chief Good and highest End; that they are willing to submit to Christ as their Prince and Saviour, trust∣ing only to his Righteousness for their Justi∣fication before God, and taking his Yoke up∣on them: I say, these Persons ought not to distress themselves, because they can't give such a distinct Account of the Time and Man∣ner of this Work of Conviction, as some others can; nor yet have experienc'd so great Terrors as others haye felt before they were
<PB N="24" REF="004803_0016_100DF1FD0CBC2990"/>
born of the Spirit. Such as have been made sensible of their lost and perishing Condition by the Fall, and then made willing to receive Jesus Christ in all his Offices as their only Saviour; have the Things found in them which go before, and accompany Salvation; and should be encourag'd to trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon their God. How∣ever, It is happy for such as are able to give a more clear and distinct Account of the pe∣culiar Season and Manner of this Work of the Spirit; for this has a tendency to bring their Minds to a better Settlement as to their Assurance of the saving Work of Grace wrought after it. On the other hand, Persons who have been under great Terrors, and now receive the Word with Joy, must rejoice with holy Fear, and look to it that they have that contrite and humble Spirit with which the high and lofty One dwells, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and the Heart of the contrite One; For there is a Joy which is no true Sign of saving Conversion. The stony-ground Hearers we have describ'd by our Lord, who searcheth the Heart, Matth. 13.20. <HI>He that received the Seed into stony Places, the same is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it:</HI> The stony Heart was not taken away, nor was there any Root of saving Grace; and accordingly in Time of Trial they wither'd. And then there's no saving Virtue in legal Terrors to
<PB N="25" REF="004803_0016_100DF1FD0CBC2990"/>
convert Men; this Change is wrought accor∣ding to the exceeding greatness of God's Pow∣er. However, neither do I speak these Things to damp their Joy who upon their Conversion may have receiv'd the <HI>Spirit of God to wit∣ness with their Spirits, that they are the Chil∣dren of God.</HI> And I make no doubt but this is the happy Case of many, when the Spirit is poured out plentifully. When there were <HI>Three Thousand</HI> Souls added, we read that <HI>they gladly receiv'd the Word,</HI> Acts 2.41. But then, I am concern'd that we may all obey that Word, and obtain the Benefit of it. <HI>Let every Man prove his own Work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another,</HI> Gal. 6.4.</P>
<P>I would only further say at present, that when the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, he shews them the guilt and derstroying Power of their Sins; maketh them sensible of their Misery and Danger as they lie ex∣posed to the Curses of the Law, and brings them to seek Deliverance with earnestness and deep Concern. And thus the Spirit pre∣pareth them to hearken to the gracious Invi∣tations and Offers of the Gospel, while he also shews them their utter Inability to come up to the Terms of the Gospel in their own Strength, and their great Unworthiness that God should work in them to will and to do. And therefore, that if they are sav'd, it must be from the free sovereign Grace of God,
<PB N="26" REF="004803_0017_100DF1FF9441BEC8"/>
who has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy. And as to such whom the Spirit of God con∣verts, he changeth their Hearts, renews them in the Spirit of their Minds respecting every Power of the Soul; and so perswadeth and enableth them to Trust in Jesus Christ <HI>as the only Name given among Men wherely we must be saved;</HI> taking their Encouragement from the Grace of God, the Merits of Christ, and free Offers of the Gospel. When Christ is thus formed in the Heart, the poor Creature so highly savour'd, is ready to cry out, Lord this Salvation is too great and good for me; but thou art worthy to be believed and obey'd, and nothing is too great or wonderful for thee. <HI>Be it unto me according to thy Word.</HI></P>

<P>His Presence with God's People is better to them, even then the bodily Presence of Christ upon Earth; for our Saviour assur'd his Dis∣ciples that it was expedient for them that he should go away, that the <HI>Comforter might come unto them.</HI> And He is the Dispenser of all Grace. The Love of God is shed abroad in the Heart, and the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ bro't home to the Soul, by the Com∣munion of the Holy Ghost. We are blessed
<PB N="27" REF="004803_0017_100DF1FF9441BEC8"/>
in His Name; common and saving Grace are communicated by him to perishing Sinners: and therefore we ought to ascribe Blessing and Glory and Honour to him, who is <HI>called God,</HI> Act 5.3, 4. <HI>There are Three that bear re∣cord in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these Three are One,</HI> 1 Joh. 5 7. Let us then fall down and worship that God who is the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. And let us be sensible that the Application of the Redemption purchased by Christ is from the Holy Spirit. When we behold many convinced of Sin, and some in a judgment of Charity converted; let us look above Men and Means, and say, <HI>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Glory.</HI> We have in a publick and solemn manner sought the Lord for this great Gift, and now we should bless God for it, and be∣seech Him to give his Spirit more abundantly.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is it the Spirit of God who reproveth Men of Sin? <HI>Learn the dangerous State of such as are secure in Sin, or stifle their Con∣victions.</HI></P>
<P>It's a dreadful Thing for Men to be suffer'd to have an accursed quiet false Peace in the Ways of Sin, Luk. 11.21. <HI>When a strong Man armed keepeth his Palace, his Goods are in Peace.</HI> Alas! Satan ruleth in the Hearts of these miserable Creatures without controul, and they are led Captive by him at his Will.
<PB N="28" REF="004803_0018_100DF201449F1B00"/>
They hug their Chains, and are unconcern'd about Deliverance, while they are permitted to enjoy the Pleasure's of Sin without remorse of Conscience. <HI>They sport themselves with their own Deceivings,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.13. And God threatens to bring sudden and irrecoverable Ruin upon them. <HI>When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden Destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a Woman with Child, and they shall not escape,</HI> 1 Thes 5.3. And it is a very dangerous Sign when Persons are con∣tinued under the Means of Grace, and yet are sleeping in carnal Security: They sleep as on the Top of a Mast, and are in Danger every Moment of falling, and of being drown'd in eternal Perdition. O hear God's Voice then without Delay, lest you lift up your Eyes in Torments, and in utter Despair be∣hold a vast Gulph fix'd between you and the Seat of the Blessed! <HI>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee Life,</HI> Eph. 5, 14. O cry to God for his Spirit to convince and convert you! For surely, it's better to endure some present Pain and Distress, while yet there is Hope; than to be shut out into outer Darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of Teeth forever. O let me not seem to you, while thus warn∣ning you to flee from the Wrath to come, as <HI>Lot</HI> to his Sons-in-law, as one that mocketh! <HI>Lot went out, and spake unto his Sons in law, which married his Daughters, and said, Up,
<PB N="29" REF="004803_0018_100DF201449F1B00"/>
get ye out of this Place; for the Lord will de∣stroy this City: but he seemed as one that mocked unto his Sons in law,</HI> Gen. 19.14. Thus we may suppose they slept securely that Night; but what came in the Morning? <HI>The Lord rain'd upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha Brim∣stone and Fire from the Lord out of Heaven,</HI> 24 v. And when the Fire from Heaven had destroyed their Bodies, their miserable Souls were cast into Hell. <HI>Even as Sodom and Go∣morrha, and the Cities about them, in like manner giving themselves over to Fornication, and going after strange Flesh, are set forth for an Example, suffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire</HI> Jude <HI>v</HI> 7. O escape for your Lives then this Night, lest by to Morrow you be consumed! Or have you been favoured with Convictions, but have stifled and lost them? Can you remember when the Spirit of God moved on your Hearts, exciting you to pray, and attend to the preaching of the Word; to put away Sin, and to reform your Lives? But now these good Motions cease, and the Spirit is departed from you. Is this your un∣happy State? Know it, Your Case is very hazardous, yet not desperate. Fear then, lest God should punish you with the <HI>Men that are settled on their Lees.</HI> Justify God in this Matter, and confess that you have greatly sinn'd by vexing his good Spirit. At the same Time, take heed and beware of going on des∣perately in your Sins, as if there was no Hope.
<PB N="30" REF="004803_0019_100DF20365791FD8"/>
Even such as you have found Mercy. Seek to God then the more earnestly to revive his Work in your Souls. Be the more sensible from this of the deep Corruption of your Hearts, and of the Enmity of your carnal Minds against God; and deprecate that dread∣ful Judgment of judicial Blindness and hard∣ness of Heart. Bemoan your selves, and say, <HI>O that it was with me, as in Months past</HI> And let that be your earnest and continued Prayer, <HI>Cast me not away from thy Presence; and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let such as are under the Convictions of the Spirit, bless God for them; and in the use of all Proper Means seek the Lord that these may end in a saving Conversion.</HI></P>
<P>Hath God sent his Spirit to convince you of Sin, and shew to you your need of a Sa∣viour? Be encouraged to ask the holy Spirit to reveal Christ unto you, as the <HI>Lord your Righteousness;</HI> that you may embrace Him as he is freely offer'd in the Gospel. Are you brought to attend God's Word with Fear and Concern? O seek the inward and effectual Call of the Spirit! that you may now say, Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth. Hear the Words of our Saviour, and let them strengthen the Hands which hang down and confirm the feeble Knees, when you may be ready to faint and wax weary in yoar Minds. Luke 11.9. <HI>Ask, and it shall be given you: Seek, and ye shall find: Knock, and it shall be

You are not far from the Kingdom of God, O strive to enter then, looking to God to work in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleasure! And take heed you do not <HI>quench the Spirit</HI> by returning to your Sins, or to your sinful Companions. Now follow hard after God by a constant and diligent Attendance to the Means of Grace. Be fre∣quent and servent in <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> confes∣sing your Sins and crying for Mercy in the Name of Jesus Christ. Get alone, think upon your Ways and <HI>meditate</HI> upon divine Things. <HI>Study the Word of God,</HI> which is perfect, con∣verting the Soul; and take heed how you hear it. For <HI>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing hy the Word of God,</HI> Rom. 10.17. Wait at the Posts of Wisdom's Doors, and labour to be found in those Ways in which Christ walks. And yet take heed and beware of depending on your religious Duties and out∣ward Reformations. Say with your self, An Interest in Christ I must have; and according∣ly while you use the Means, seek Rest to your Souls in Him. Be willing to bear the
<PB N="32" REF="004803_0020_100DF205D0C75D48"/>
Spirit's Reproofs, tho' sharp and pungent; but if Terrors be overbearing, beseech the Lord that he would not lay more upon you, than he shall enable you to bear. Indeed there may be some few ready to complain with <HI>Heman, While I suffer thy Terrors, I am distracted.</HI> But blessed be God! This is not the ordinary Case. And where the re∣gular use of Reason hath been disturbed, I am satisfied it was not so much from any direct Impressions of the good Spirit of God, as from natural Disorders of Body, or moral Distempers of mind. Our gracious God would not have, no not the <HI>incestuous Corin∣thian, swallowen up with over-much Sorrow,</HI> 2 Cor. 2.7. However, Pray God to shew you the plague of your own Heart, and be sensi∣ble that the Wound Sin hath given you is incurable unless it will please the great God our Saviour to be the <HI>Physician.</HI> According∣ly, despairing in your self, Look to <HI>Jesus,</HI> and say, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me whole. Thy Blood cleanseth from all Sin, and thy divine Spirit is able to apply it. <HI>Heal my Soul, for I have sinned against Thee.</HI> If <HI>Satan</HI> tempt you to return to your carnal Security, or to despair as if your Sins were so great that God would not pardon them; resist him, and cry to God to <HI>bruise him un∣der your Feet.</HI> And labour to be furnished with pertinent Texts of Scripture whereby you may answer and confute such evil Sug∣gestions.

Thus if you are tempted by Satan or your own Lusts, to return to your Evil Courses; answer, It is written, <HI>If any Man draw back, my Soul shall have no Pleasure in him,</HI> Heb. 10.38. Or if tempted to say, mine Iniquity is greater than that it may be forgiven; answer, It is written, <HI>Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord: tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow; tho' they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool,</HI> Isa. 1.18. And instead of yielding to the Temptation, Plead with God in the Words of <HI>David, For thy Names sake, O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity: for it is great.</HI> Psal. 25 12. And do not perplex your self as if you had committed <HI>the Sin against the Holy Ghost, which is unto Death.</HI> The good Impressions you now receive from the Spirit striving with you, make it evident that this is not your Case. Again, If you <HI>seem to grow worse and worse</HI> after considerable Labour and Striving, be not discouraged as if it was in vain for you to strive any Longer. The Spirit of God rather discovereth to you more and more the deep Corruption of your Hearts, which is an hopeful Symptom, and should be improv'd to convince you more thorowly of your need of the infinite. Power &amp; Grace of God to save you. And then, <HI>If you are continued for a considerable Time under this Work, and cant find Rest;</HI> do not grow im∣patient, and say it is in vain to wait for the

Lord any longer: But rather resolve that by his Help you will hope and wait for the Sal∣vation of God. I pray consider, how long God hath waited upon you, it may be <HI>Ten, Twenty,</HI> or <HI>Thirty Years;</HI> and will you think it hard to wait upon God a few Months or Years? O be not so unrreasonable and undu∣tiful! It is of the Lord's Mercies you are not consumed, and it must be of his free undeser∣ved Mercy, if you are saved. Certainly then you are well-treated, and have a rich Reward of all your Pains, if God shall come at the last and save you, even when this frail short Life is just expiring. Or, <HI>If others a∣wakened after you, obtain Grace and Comfort before you,</HI> let not your Eye be evil, because God is good. Is it not lawful for Him to do what He will with his own? O take heed then and beware of entertaining hard Tho'ts of God! Lie down at the Foot of sovereign Grace, and wait God's Time without Mur∣muring and Complaint. Again, Are <HI>blasphe∣mous Thoughts injected?</HI> Cast them out with Abhorrence, and be not dismayed. The evil One who casts these fiery Darts, must bear the Blame and Punishment. In a Word, <HI>Do not perplex yourselves with anxious Inqui∣ries about your Election.</HI> This is absord and preposterous at this Time. Hear that Word then, <HI>The secret Things belong unto the Lord our God; but those Things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our Children forever,

that we may do all the Words of this Law,</HI> Deut. 29.29. Your Duty is plainly reveal'd; <HI>Give Diligence to make your Calling and E∣lection sure: for if ye do these Things, ye shall never fall.</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. Make sure of the effectual Call of the Spirit, and then you may safely conclude that God has loved you with an everlasting Love, and so drawn you to himself. Let this great Work then be regarded as the One Thing needful: however, let not your particular Calling be neg∣lected in the Season for it. Wherein you are call'd abide with God, attending this Business also in Obedience to him. The Work of your Salvation will be most likely to prosper, when every Duty is attended in it's Place and Time. Upon the whole, <HI>Do not conceal the Distress of your Souls;</HI> but be willing to ask and receive Advice in a Matter of such great Im∣portance. Seek the Help of your Pastors, and other experienc'd Christians. But then, in the diligent use of Means, let your Eye and Cry be to the God of all Grace from whom your Help must come. And en∣courage your selves in this, that you are in the Hands of a God in finitely good and gra∣cious, who has sent the Lord Jesus to <HI>bind up the broken hearted.</HI> Behold the Son of God stands at the Door and knocks, saying, <HI>If any Man hear my Voice, &amp; open the Door, I will come in to him, &amp; sup with him, &amp; be with me,</HI> Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.20.

Do thou who hast the Key of <HI>David,</HI> who openest, and no Man shutteth; Open their Hearts, and make them thy willing People in the Day of thy Power. Thy Words are Works. Speak the Word, and their Souls shall live. Say to one and another that tremble at thy World; Son, Daughter, be of good Com∣fort your Sins are forgiven, go in Peace." And may you now hear that Word of your Compassionate Redeemer, <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye shall find rest unto your Souls,</HI> Matth. 11.28, 9.

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The Holy Spirit is the Author of this Work of Conviction.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> We consider'd the Means which the Spirit of God useth to convince Men of Sin.</P>
<P>I proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>To give some brief Description of the Work of the Spirit in convincing and reproving Men of Sin.</HI> Wherein I shall also consider some of the Fruits of the these Convictions.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="004803_0023_100DF20D822F4F98"/>Before I speak particularly to this Head, I would observe to you, that the infinite Spirit of God hath the nearest Access to our Spirits which are his Creatures, and can make Im∣pressions upon them as he pleaseth: And he convinceth Sinners by an inward Application to the Powers of the Soul, the Understand∣ing, Conscience, &amp;c. before a saving Change is wrought in the Heart.</P>
<P N="1">1. In this Work of Conviction <HI>the Spirit of God brings Home the Sense of Sin and the Guilt to the Heart and Conscience of the Sinner.</HI> And then his Spirit is wounded, and his Heart mov'd with Fear. Tho' Men will generally acknowledge that they are Sinners, yet alas! there are many unconverted Persons who flatter themselves in their evil Ways as if Sin had not Dominion over them, and they were not walking in the Path of the Destroy∣er. Many are in a lamentable manner ig∣norant of the Strictness and Purity of God's Law, and at the same Time very much Stran∣gers to their own deceitful Hearts. It seem∣eth that <HI>Paul,</HI> while Pharisee, was not sen∣sible that the first Motions of evil Concupi∣scence were Sin. Rom. 7.7. And <HI>Ephraim</HI> says, <HI>In all my Labours they shall find none Iniquity in me that is Sin:</HI> Tho' the Balan∣ces of Deceit were in his Hand, and he loved to oppress. <HI>Hos.</HI> 12.7, 8. How many false Pleas and vain Excuses do Men frame to blind
<PB N="39" REF="004803_0023_100DF20D822F4F98"/>
and bribe their Consciences? whereby they are laid asleep in carnal Security. <HI>There is a Way which seemeth right unto a Man; but the End thereof are the Ways of Death,</HI> Prov. 14.12. So deceitful and desperately wicked are the Hearts of Men. But when the Spirit of God comes with the Word to shew Men their Iniquity, he detects and lays open this Deceit, and maketh the Sinner know that he has offended the holy, heart-searching God, and stands condemned by His righte∣ous Law. Conscience is awakened to do it's Office, and as it were says to the Sinner, <HI>Thou are the Man:</HI> And now, he beholdeth his Sin in it's hainous Nature and Aggrava∣tions; and self-judged, maketh that Confession before the Lord, <HI>Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this Evil in they Sight,</HI> Psal. 51.4. When the Spirit of God reproveth Men of Sin, they dare not deny the Fact, nor excuse the Fault or Crime cleaving to it. But rather deprecate God's entering into Judg∣ment with them, saying with the Psalmist, <HI>If thou Lord, shouldst mark Iniquities:</HI> O Lord, <HI>who shall stand</HI> Psal 130.3. Surely none can stand in the Judgment, says the convinced Sinner; and as for me, I am now sensible that I must fall under the condemning Sentence of the Law, vile Wretch that I am. And tho; this may be at first from Conviction of some particular Sin, as here of the Sin of Un∣belief; yet the Spirit of God leads Men up
<PB N="40" REF="004803_0024_100DF20F461EAE50"/>
to the Consideration of their guiltiness and vileness as Children of Apostate <HI>Adam;</HI> shew∣eth them that they sinned in him and fell with him, and that as they proceed from him they bring a corrupt Nature into the World with them, empty of Grace, and bent unto Sin. And now they are ready to subscribe that Con∣fession, Psal. 51.5. <HI>Behold I was shapen in Iniquity: and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> Now God's Word is set home upon their Hearts, in which it is declared, that all are under Sin; there's none Righteous, no not one. Their <HI>Mouths are stop'd, and they become guilty before God,</HI> Rom. 3.19. And they are ready to acknowledge that they were expos'd to the Wrath and Curse of God as a Generation of Vipers, even from their early Childhood. And whatever have been their outward Attendance on religious Duties, and blameless Behaviour before Men; they now find that they are Children of Wrath, even as others. This was the Case of <HI>Saul,</HI> after∣wards call'd <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' he had liv'd as a strict Pharisee, a blameless Life according to his understanding of the Law. <HI>I was alive with∣out the Law once; but when the Command∣ment came, Sin revived, and I died,</HI> Rom. 7.9. While a Pharisee, tho' he had the Law in the Letter of it, yet he was wihtout the Law, be∣ing dreadfully ignorant of the spiritual Mean∣ing and Use of it, as also of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Purity and ex∣tensive Obligation and so he tho't himself
<PB N="41" REF="004803_0024_100DF20F461EAE50"/>
alive, in a good Condition; and that he was in a fair Way to obtain Life by the Deeds of the Law: But when the Commandment was set home upon his Conscience, and the Spirit of God convinced him of his Sin by the Law, his vain Hopes died away, and he found himself in a State of spiritual Death, dead in Trespasses and Sins. And this is the Case of the closest Hypocrites and most spe∣cious Formalists, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to convince and reprove them of Sin: When he thus by his Word of Providence sheweth them their Work, and their Trans∣gressions, that they have exceeded; they can no longer cover their Sins, nor flatter them∣selves in their evil Ways. Their own Hearts condemn them, and they see themselves ex∣pos'd to the Judgment of that God▪ who is greater than their Hearts, and knoweth all Things. And accordingly they are ready to fall down before God and confess with them, <HI>We are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the Wind, have taken us away,</HI> Isa. 64.6. Whence followeth deep Concern, and some∣times almost overwhelming Anguish and Di∣stress of Soul. Which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. In this Work <HI>the Spirit of God maketh Men sensible of the deadly Evil of Sin, and of their miserable State <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Guilt,
<PB N="42" REF="004803_0025_100DF21245323340"/>
and Dominion of it.</HI> As the Spirit of God shews Sinners the Guilt and Power of their Sins, so he declareth to them the dreadful Punishment which they lie expos'd to as Transgressors of the Law; that the Wa∣ges of Sin is Death, not only temporal, but eternal Death. <HI>Is not Destruction to the Wicked? and a strange Punishment to the Workers of Iniquity?</HI> Job 31.3. Yes surely, and when the Spirit of God pleaseth, he can make the stoutest Sinner sensible of it. Such is the Folly and Madness bound up in the Hearts of Men, that they are ready to make a mock of Sin. While asleep in carnal Security, they dream of enjoying the Pleasures of Sin, with∣out enduring the Punishment. <HI>He flattereth himself in his own Eyes, until his Iniquity be found to be hateful.</HI> Ps. 36.2. Thus it is said of the <HI>Young Man,</HI> void of Understanding, when enticed by the Adulteress, <HI>He goeth after her straightway, as an Ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a Fool to the correction of the stocks: Till a Dart strike through his Liver, as a Bird hasteth to the Snare, and knoweth not that it is for his Life,</HI> Prov. 7.22, 23. Men do not know, they will not consider the End of Sin, tho' faithfully warn'd in God's Word; and so they often go on in the Ways which lead to Death, till they are suddenly destroy'd. <HI>The simple passon, and are punished,</HI> Prov. 22.3. And the <HI>Old Serpent</HI> the Devil, is still ready to tempt us as he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Eve, Ye shall not surely
<PB N="43" REF="004803_0025_100DF21245323340"/>
die:</HI> This subtle Tempter seeks to allure Men, by setting before them the carnal Pleasures and Profits of Sin; and at the same Time laboureth to divert their Minds from all se∣rious Consideration of the Punishement. Alas, how successfully! It is supposed that there might be found among God's People, Man or Woman, that would say, <HI>I shall have Peace, tho' I walk in the Imagination of my Heart, to add Drunkenness to Thirst:</HI> But the Lord threatens, <HI>That he will not spare him, but the Anger of the Lord and his Jealousy shall smoke against that Man, and all the Curses written in this Book shall lie upon him,</HI> Deut. 29.18, 20. And accordingly, when the Spirit of God shoots the Arrows of Conviction into the Sin∣ners Heart, he sheweth him the daring Pre∣sumption of this, and maketh him know that Sin is an evil Thing, and will be bitterness in the End. The Spirit makes Men feel the Plague of their own Hearts, and the deadly Wounds Sin hat given them. Now they find that Description agreeth to them; <HI>The whole Head is sick, and the whole Heart is faint. From the sole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is no soundness in it; but Wounds and Bruises and putrifying Sores,</HI> Isa. 1.5, 6. When the Word of God is thus impress'd upon the Sinner's Heart, it is <HI>like Fire,</HI> re∣specting the Light it gives to discern the Evil of Sin, and the Pain and Misery inflicted on the Soul consequent upon this. Thus the
<PB N="44" REF="004803_0026_100DF214C6D80F58"/>
Spirit of God shews Men the great Evil of an Heart of Unbelief whereby they depart from the living God, and reject the only Saviour, by such a Word as that, <HI>He that believeth not, shall be damned,</HI> Mark 16.16. The great Evil of an hard and impenitent Heart, where∣by Men treasure up Wrath against the Day of Warth, by such a Word as that, <HI>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish,</HI> Luke 1 3 3. And their Consciences are inflamed with painful Apprehensions of the burning Wrath of God due to them for their Sins. Now that Word cometh home to them, <HI>Thou hast destroyed thy self,</HI> Hos. 13.9. And sen∣sible of their miserable State, they cry out with the <HI>Prodigal, I perish.</HI> Luke 15.17. They no longer dream that the Plea∣sures of Sin can be separated from the Punishment; but now find they have to do with an holy heart-searching jealous God, that will by no means clear the guilty. God speaks to them by his Word, together with the inward Impressions of his Spirit, as Psal. 50.21, 21. <HI>These Things hast thou done and I kept silence: thou thoughtest that I was altoge∣ther such a one as they self: but I will reprove thee, and let them in order before thine Eyes. Now consider this, ye that forget God, least I tear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver.</HI> And while the Spirit of God is thus a spirit of Bondage, the Sinner trembleth for Fear of God, and is afraid of his Judgments. Thus
<PB N="45" REF="004803_0026_100DF214C6D80F58"/>
We read <HI>The Sinners in Zion are afraid, fear∣fulness hath surised the Hypocrites: who a∣mong us shall dwell with the devouring Fire? Who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting Burnings?</HI> Isa. 33.14. They now know the Terrors of the Lord, and find that he is of pu∣rer Eyes than to behold Evil, and can't look on Iniquity without Abhorrence. They are in Anguish while their Sins lie heavy upon them, and the iron Yoke galls their Consciences. And are ready to complain that their Iniquities are gone over their Heads, as an heavy Burden too heavy for them to bear. Yea, now the Sinner is sometimes almost dis∣mayed with Fear lest God should take him away with a Stroke, and cast him into Hell.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the Spirit of God reproveth of Sin, <HI>He brings the Sinner to humble himself before God.</HI> When the Arrows of Conviction are sharp in the Hearts of the King's E∣nemies, <HI>the People fall down under him,</HI> Psal. 45.5 Thus it is when our Lord rides forth on the Word of Truth accompanied with the holy Spirit, the Sinner lieth prostrate at his Feet, sensible that it is a dreadful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God, as an Avenger of Sin. Now there is a Work of Humiliation wrought, in which the Haugh∣tiness of the Sinner's Spirit is quelled, and he is cast down convinced that he can't resist God,
<PB N="46" REF="004803_0027_100DF2176B571BA8"/>
and prosper. He is made sensible that God can break him in Pieces, and that none is able to deliver out of his Hand. Such a Word as that is set home upon his Conscience. <HI>See now that I, even I am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my Hand. For I lift up my Hand to Heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering Sword, and mine hand take hold on Judgment; I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</HI> And when the convin∣ced Sinner finds himself thus in the Hands of that God, who is able to save or destroy forever; he lieth down in the Dust before him. Now the lofty Looks of Men are humbled, and God is exalted. Thus when God denounced dreadful Threatnings against <HI>Ahah,</HI> by the Prophet <HI>Elijah,</HI> it is said, <HI>And it came to pass when Ahah heard those Words, that he rent his Cloathes, and put Sackcloth upon his Flesh, and fasted, and lay in Sacrcloth, and went softly,</HI> 1 Kings 21.27. Yea, such was his Humiliation, though here was no true sa∣ving Repentance, that God was pleas'd to take a gracious Notice of it, and mitigate the Judgment threatned, 29th <HI>ver. Seest thou how Ahah humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the Evil in his Days.</HI> In like manner, the cruel hardy <HI>Jailor</HI> fell
<PB N="47" REF="004803_0027_100DF2176B571BA8"/>
down before <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> as the Servants of the most high God, humbly to intreat them to shew him the Way of Salvation, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.29, 30. Had he done this to wor∣ship them, they would have rejected it with Abhorrence. He did it, as a judicous Expo∣sitor supposeth, "being moved by the Fear of God's Judgments thus to humble him∣self"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calvin.</NOTE>When Men are thus convinced, their haughty and stubborn Spirits are bro't down, they are forced to quit their carnal Confidences as Refuges of Lies, and are bro't before God, as the Servants of <HI>Benhadad</HI> came in his Name, before the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> with Ropes upon their Heads; and with that sub∣missive Request, <HI>I pray thee let me live.</HI> To allude to those Words, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20.31, 32. For they now find that they lie at God's Mercy, and have a dread of his fiery Indig∣nation lest it should consume them. We read, that <HI>The Wicked, through the Pride of his Countenance, will not seek after God,</HI> Psal. 10.4. But when God cometh upon the Sinner by his Spirit to shew him his Sin and Misery, and the Danger he is in of being broken to Pieces in the Day of his Wrath; then you shall hear him cry, <HI>Mercy Lord,</HI> Mercy for a miserable Sinner, or I perish!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="48" REF="004803_0028_100DF2191745A058"/>4. When the Spirit doth thus convince of Sin, <HI>He maketh the Sinner confess his Sin, and exciteth him to reform his Life.</HI> Tho' in this Work there is not a Principle of saving Grace infus'd in Opposition to Sin, yet Sin is made bitter from the Fruits of it; so that while the Spirit of God doth in this manner strive with the Sinner, and impresseth on his Mind a dread of God's Wrath, he dare, not go on in his evil Courses, and can't, relish the Pleasures of Sin, as when he liv'd in carnal Security, fearing lest that Threat∣ning should be fulfill'd upon him; <HI>How much she hath glorified herself, and lived delici∣ously, so much Torment and Sorrow give her,</HI> Rev. 18.7. His Case is like that express'd Job 20.12—14. <HI>Though Wickedness be sweet in his Mouth, though he hide it under his Tongue; Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his Mouth: Yet his Meat in his Bowels is turned, it is the Gall of Asps within him.</HI> And now the Burden of Sin lieth so heavy upon the Consciences of Men, that they are compel'd as it were to seek Re∣lief, by confessing their Sins before God; and they find themselves constrain'd to cry out of their sad and wretched State before Men. When <HI>Samuel</HI> reproved <HI>Saul</HI> for not utter∣ly destroying <HI>Amalek,</HI> tho' at first he en∣deavour'd to excuse himself, yet when the Prophet declared to him that because he had rejected the Word of the Lord, God had
<PB N="49" REF="004803_0028_100DF2191745A058"/>
also rejected him from being King; being convicted in his Conscience, he said, <HI>I have sinned,</HI> 2 Sam. 15.24. And now the Sinner is sick of his Sin, and casts it up. He can't now drink down Iniquity like Water with greediness and delight, as he did before; but rather abstains from the outward Commission of it, and formeth Resolutions against it. If tempted, while the Spirit is thus striving with him, it is as if you should offer pleasant Drink to a Man, and at the same Time assure him that there is Poison in the Cup He for the present at lest, puts away Sin for Fear of Wrath, and turns from his wicked Com∣panions. You may observe a visible Alte∣ration in him. While these strong Con∣victions of the Spirit are upon him, he is re∣strain'd from the Commission of Sin; but then if he is lest to quench these good Motions, and the Spirit is provok'd to depart from him, and cease striving; we have his dismal Case described, 2 Pet. 2.20,— 22.— <HI>If after they have escaped the Pollutions of the World thro' the Knowlege of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again intangled therein, and overcome; the latter End is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righ∣teousness, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them ac∣cording to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned
<PB N="50" REF="004803_0029_100DF21B99A7E2E8"/>
to his own Vomit again; and the Sow that was washed to her wallowing in the Mire</HI> O it is a dreadful Thing to Sin against such Light, and stifle such Convictions of the Spirit! Let such as are favour'd with them take heed there∣fore, and beware of this most dangerous and provoking Evil.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this Work <HI>the Spirit of God sheweth Men the utter Insufficiency of Creature-Com∣forts to afford Relief to their troubled Minds.</HI> While Men are secure in Sin, they are very prone to Promise themselves Satisfaction in their outward Enjoyments, and so to be un∣concern'd about obtaining the Favour of God. <HI>They spend their Days in Wealth, and in a Moment go down to the Grave. Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the Knowledge of thy Ways,</HI> Job 21.13, 14 The Riches and Pleasures of this Life often divert Men's Minds from a serious Attention to the Calls of the Gospel. When invited to partake of the rich Provision God had made for perishing Sinners; <HI>They make Light of it, and go their Ways, one to his Farm, another to his Merchandise,</HI> Matth. 22.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> They are ready to say with the rich Man <HI>Soul, thou hast much Goods laid up for many Years; take, thine Ease, eat, drink and be merry,</HI> Luke 12.19. But now when the Spirit of God convinceth the Sinner of the perish∣ing Condition of his Soul, he says to him, The
<PB N="51" REF="004803_0029_100DF21B99A7E2E8"/>
Fool, this Night thy Soul may be required of thee; you hang over the bottomless Pit by the slender Thread of a frail Life, and may before to Morrow lift up your Eyes in Torments. And when thus reprov'd of their Sin and Folly, their carnal Confi∣dence and Satisfaction in Creatures are blasted, and their Mirth is turned into Hea∣viness. None of their worldly Enjoyments appear to them as they did before; they have lost their Relish for them. For now they are convinced that these Things can't profit in the Day of Wrath, nor redeem them from Destruction. Yea, If they have gotten their earthly Possessions by unrighte∣ous Practices, the Spirit of God sheweth them that they have been treasuring up Wrath against the Day of Wrath. And now they are ready to say, What shall it profit us, tho' we gain the whole World, and lose our Souls? What good will these Things do us, if we must sink down under the Weight of God's Wrath, and perish forever in Hell? Alas! we shall be the more miserable upon the Account of them, in the terrible Day of the Lord. And thus are they brought to realise it, that if they would find rest for their Souls, they must seek better Things. And are convinced of the great Evil of seek∣ing their Happiness in Creatures, in oppo∣sition to God.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="004803_0030_100DF21D96BB2EF0"/>Which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="6">6. When the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Sin, <HI>He exciteth them to seek Deli∣verance in the diligent use of the Means of Grace and Salvation.</HI> Now they find that nothing can give them Ease, while the Bur∣den of Sin lieth heavy upon them, and ac∣cordingly they are concern'd to seek the Lord in the Ways of his own Appointment, if haply they may find him who alone is able to save them from Sin &amp; Death. Before they might cast; off Fear, and restrain Prayer; but now they cry for Mercy. Indeed the Force of Education and Custom may prevail with Men to attend religious Duties, but then this is done in formality, and with little Con∣cern about their Souls. Whereas when the holy Spirit cometh upon Men to convince them of their Sin and Danger, his Voice is like that Jonah 1.6. <HI>What meanest thou, O Sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</HI> And when these Convictions are strong up∣on them, they are ready to make that In∣quiry with great Seriousness, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> Acts 16.30. And to say with them who were pricked in their Heart, Men and Brethren, <HI>What shall we do?</HI> And now it may be said of them as of <HI>Saul.</HI> Behold, <HI>he prayeth,</HI> Acts 9.11 No doubt <HI>Saul</HI> ha∣ving been a Pharisee, had made many Prayers before this; but now in anguish of Spirit we
<PB N="53" REF="004803_0030_100DF21D96BB2EF0"/>
may suppose he was ready to say with the <HI>Publican, Lord be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> The Whole need not the Physician; but when Sinners are made to feel the Smart of those deadly Wounds which Sin hath given them, and at the same Time hear of a Sa∣viour; they are pressed in Spirit to seek to him, saying, <HI>Lord save me, or I perish.</HI> Now they also attend to the preaching of the Word after another manner than before, finding that the Threatnings and Reproofs of God's Word belong to them, and being concern'd to flee from the Wrath to come. Their Fears urge them to mind the Duties of Religion, and to strive to enter in at the strait Gate, lest their Day of Grace should end before they have obtain'd an Interest in Jesus Christ. For now they dread the Damnation of Hell.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The Spirit of God beats Men off from a carnal Dependance on their religious Du∣ties, and sheweth them that their Salvation must come from God alone.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be fear'd that many who have been under Convictions, and so turned from open Impiety to some outward Reformation and Attendance on religious Duties, stop here, and never go out to Christ for Salvation. Our Lord assureth us that there are <HI>foolish Virgins</HI> in the visible Church, that content themselves with an outward Prosession, with∣out

being concerne'd to obtain the Oil of saving Grace in their Hearts; and then fall asleep in carnal Security, until they are a∣waked by the Midnight Cry, Go ye out to meet him. And then they are wholly at a loss, finding the Door of Mercy shut against them. They cry, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He answereth, I know you not, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. And therefore, when the Spirit of God is pleas'd to carry on his Work, he convin∣ceth Men of the great Evil and Danger of their resting here, without a saving Conver∣sion to God, and Union with Christ by Faith. He sheweth them more and more the Vile∣ness of their own Hearts, and the absolute Necessity of their being renewed in the Spirit of their Minds after the Image of God; that <HI>except they are born again, they can't see the Kingdom of God.</HI> And convinceth them that if they are saved after all, it must not be according to Works which they have done, but according to the free Grace and Mercy of God, thro' the Merits of Jesus Christ. The Promise is not made to them <HI>that labour, and are heavy laden;</HI> but to them who being heavy laden with the Burden of their Sins, <HI>Go to Christ</HI> upon his most gra∣cious Call and Invitation; <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> Matth. 11.28. And our Lord declareth, <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out,</HI> Joh. 6.37. Now we
<PB N="55" REF="004803_0031_100DF220E53B8268"/>
go to Christ in the Exercise of Faith. <HI>He that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst. 35. v.</HI> Nor is the Promise made to them that attend religious Duties meerly from a slavish Fear and dread of Wrath, and without any sin∣cere Regard to the Glory of God. Indeed, It is not Sin for Persons while Unconverted, to pray to God, hear his Word, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No, Such Duties as these God requireth of them, and they are to be exhorted and encouraged to seek the Lord in these Ways of his Ap∣pointment, forasmuch as God has been of∣ten found of Men while in the diligent use of Means; but then they must be made sen∣sible that they fail in the manner of their attending upon these religious Duties. <HI>With∣out Faith it is impossible to please God,</HI> Heb. 11.6. And therefore, if Men depend on the Discharge of these religious Duties, in∣stead of using them as Means to lead them to Christ that they may be justified and sa∣ved by Faith in him, they rest on a sandy Foundation which will certainly fail them. Accordingly when the Spirit of God carrieth on his Work, he reproveth this Pharisaic Pride, and convinceth Men of the great Evil of it: So that they dare not stand before God, as the <HI>Pharisee</HI> did, saying, <HI>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, Extor∣tioners, Unjust, Adulterers, or even as this Publican. I fast twice in the Week, I give
<PB N="56" REF="004803_0032_100DF223295C4990"/>
Tithes of all I possess,</HI> Luke 18.12. No, but rather with the <HI>Publican,</HI> cry for Mercy, after all the Pains they have taken to seek the Lord in the Way of Duty. The Spi∣rit of God sheweth Men that <HI>except their Righteousness shall exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, they shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> See <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.20. And maketh them sensible that notwithstanding all their Labours in Duty and outward Reformations, God might damn them, should he deal with them in a Way of strict Justice; and that if they are saved, their Salvation must come from the Lord. And thus is the Way of the Lord prepared by the Spirit, that the Son of God may come into the Hearts of his chosen Peo∣ple, and give rest to their weary Souls. In∣deed this Work hath not a causal Virtue to produce saving Grace, as has been hinted. After all, there must be a saving Change wrought in all the Powers of the Soul by the Spirit of God, that we may receive Jesus Christ upon the gracious Offer and Command of the Gospel. We must have Jesus Christ revealed to us, and have that Faith wrought in us by the Spirit, whereby we may close with him on Gospel-Terms; and that Re∣pentance whereby we may turn from all Sin unto God. There must be such Conviction of our Need of Righteousness, and of the Per∣fection of Christ's Righteousness, as that we
<PB N="57" REF="004803_0032_100DF223295C4990"/>
may depend on him entirely for Justification before God. And there must be such a Con∣viction of Judgment, as that we may submit to the Son of God as our Lord and Judge, saying, <HI>O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy Name.</HI> Isa. 26.13. O that this may be the happy Issue of the Spirit's striving with elder and youn∣ger Persons! And may none be left to re∣sist and quench his good Motions! <HI>Come, O Breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live!</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE 1. <HI>Let us Inquire into the State of our Souls;</HI> particularly, <HI>Whether we have had the Experience of this Work of the Spirit.</HI> Has the Holy Spirit convinced us of our Sin and Misery by the Fall, so that we have been made sensible of our lost perishing State as we are the Children of the first <HI>Adam,</HI> in whom all die? It's true, there may be considerable Variety as to the Degree of the Spirit's Operation. Some may have greater Terror, and of longer Continuance than others, as we before observed. But then, We have Reason to conclude that the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Bondage unto Fear, to every unconverted Person grown to Years of Understanding and Judgment, before He
<PB N="58" REF="004803_0033_100DF22593287310"/>
is a Spirit of Regeneration and Adoption. And therefore such as are confident of their being in a State of Salvation, without a Con∣viction of Sin, and painful Sense of the de∣filing and destroying Evil of it is; have just Reason to fear that they deceive themselves. Our Saviour declareth to the <HI>Laodiceans,</HI> who were puff'd up with a proud and false Con∣ceit of themselves, that they were <HI>wretched,</HI> and <HI>miserable,</HI> and <HI>poor,</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> and <HI>na∣ked;</HI> before He counsels them to come to him for <HI>Gold tried in the Fire,</HI> that they might be enriched with saving Grace more precious than Gold, <HI>&amp;c. Rev.</HI> 3.17, 18. Let us then examine and try ourselves, whether we have ever felt the Burden of our Sins too heavy for us to bear, and been made sensi∣ble of the vile Corruption of our Hearts; so as to cry to God for Deliverance, being convinced that nothing short of his Almighty Power and Grace can save us. And here, sup∣posing the Case, that some of you were conver∣ted while very Young, yet it is incumbent on you to inquire, whether you have such a spiritual Sight of the Evil of Sin, as to be in bitterness upon the Account of it, and to be excited to work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling. This is plain, That the best of Men in this imperfect State have reason to cry out, <HI>Lord, Help our Unbelief!</HI> And to groan out that Complaint, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from

the Body of this Death!</HI> Rom. 7.24. And when they have indulged themselves for any Time in carnal Security, or fallen into scandalous Sins, the Spirit of God has so withdrawn from them, that they have been brought into great Perplexity, and could have no solid Peace till renewed to Repen∣tance. This was <HI>David's</HI> Case, <HI>Psal</HI> 51. And <HI>Peter</HI>'s, Luke 22.61, 62. Agreably, our Saviour said to him, <HI>When thou art con∣verted, strengthen thy Brethren,</HI> Luke 22.32. Indeed that God who hath begun a good Work in true Converts, will perform it un∣til the Day of Jesus Christ. However, even these may need a further and more thorow Conversion from particular Ways of sinning, that they may be in a next Disposition to attend the Duties and enjoy the Blessings of Christ's Kingdom, after a comfortable manner, <HI>Matth.</HI> 18.3. Surely then, there's weighty Reason why we should all of us look into the State of our Souls, and inquire what Convictions we have experienced, and what hath been the Issue of them. And after all, we should make that Prayer, <HI>Search me O God, and know my Heart: try me, and know my thoughts. And see if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way everlasting,</HI> Psal. 139.23, 24.</P>
<P>USE 2. Are the Convictions of the Spirit so sharp and pungent sometimes? <HI>How dread∣ful
<PB N="60" REF="004803_0034_100DF227E84C73B8"/>
must it be then to fall under the vin∣dictive Wrath of God in Hell forever?</HI></P>
<P>Do Sinners now while there is Hope, fear and tremble before the Lord when he thus reproveth them for Sin? Are they pricked to the Heart, and sometimes ready to cry out under the heavy Load of Sin, <HI>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</HI> Certainly then the Torments of Hell will be altogether intol∣erable; where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched. Hell is a bottom∣less Pit, in which the damned sink down in everlasting Despair, without the least gleam of Hope, while the Wrath of God is poured out upon them to the uttermost. <HI>The Childreen of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</HI> Matth. 8.12 Can you not bear the Spirit's Convictions, when he sets home the Threatnings of God's Word upon your Consciences? How will you then be able to hear that Sentence pronounc'd by your Lord and Judge; <HI>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</HI> and then to have it executed upon you. O you will be ut∣terly consumed with Terror!</P>

<P><PB N="61" REF="004803_0034_100DF227E84C73B8"/>O let the Terrors of the Lord rouse you! Open your Eyes, consider your hainous Ini∣quity in hardning your Hearts against God at such a Time as this, and behold your extream Danger of perishing in your Sins. For who hath hardened himself against God, and hath prospered? O let that awful Word sink down into your Ears, and into your Hearts! <HI>He that being often reproved, hard∣neth his Neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without Remedy.</HI> Prov. 29.1. Ama∣zing Stupidity! You can't but hear others complaining of an hard Heart, and desiring Prayers that God would take away the stony Heart and give an Heart of Flesh, tender and quick to receive the Impressions of God's Word and Spirit.

<P>Tho' I have spoken to you more largely in the former Discourse; yet I can't for∣bear farther to advise and direct you. Do not rest here, but be encouraged the more earnestly to seek the Things which accom∣pany Salvation. It is hopeful that this Work is brought nigh to the Birth; cry to God for Strength, that it may be brought forth with the Shouting of Grace unto it. And if your Distress should now increase, do not faint
<PB N="63" REF="004803_0035_100DF22A42B06E48"/>
but rather cry with the Psalmist, <HI>The Troubles of my Heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my Distresses,</HI> Psal. 25.17 It may be the New-Birth will quickly follow, to your unspeakable Joy. But then you must be sensible that this can't be by any Might or Power of your own; but only by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts. Look above your self then and all Creatures unto the Lord, that you may be saved. And let it encourage you, that this Work is in the Hands of the <HI>good Spirit</HI> of God, who delighteth in Holiness; and may be call'd the Holy Spirit in Scrip∣ture, partly because it is his Work to renew God's People in the Spirit of their Minds, after the Image of God which consists in Knowledge, Righteousness and Holiness: That it is in the Hands of the <HI>Almighty Spirit</HI> of God, who can convert you more easily than you can speak a Word. Surely nothing is to be despair'd of, while this divine Spirit is working upon your Hearts. O seek the more earnestly then to that God who is able to do for you above all you can ask or think! And now strive even as in an Agony, that you may enter in at the strait Gate of a saving Conversion. Why may it not be this Night? Why may there not be a saving Union be∣tween Christ and your Souls even Now? Come, All Things are ready. O God! Do thou draw them; for there is no Man can come to the Son, except the Father draw

<P>Hath God revealed his Son in and to you, by giving you his Spirit to convince you of his Righteonsness, and to enable you to be∣lieve in him to the saving of your Souls? Is the Love of God thus shed abroad in your Hearts, by the Holy Ghost? Is Christ thus formed in you? Hail, you are highly fa∣voured, the Lord is with you, and you are blessed. <HI>Flesh and Blood have not revealed the Son of God unto you, but the Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Let your Souls then magni∣fy the Lord, and your Spirits rejoice in God your Saviour. Give Glory to God, and say each one of you after Christ, <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these Things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes. Even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight,</HI> Matth, 11.25, 26. And then look to
<PB N="65" REF="004803_0036_100DF22D39295CA0"/>
the Foundation of your Joy, that it be laid in deep Repentance. <HI>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</HI> Look to it that your Joy be an humble holy Joy, and such as shall be your Strength in running the Way of God's Commandments. Of true Joy it is said, <HI>The Joy of the Lord is your Strength.</HI> Neh 8.10. Let it be as Oyl to the Wheels of your Obedience, and let your Hearts be lift up in the Ways of God, while you happily find that the Ways of Wisdom are Ways of pleasantness, and all her Paths Peace. Say with the Apostle <HI>Paul, Our re∣joicing is this, the Testimony of our Conscience, that in Simplicity &amp; godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Conversation in the World,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.12. O take heed, beware of Pride and carnal Security! <HI>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoice with trembling.</HI> And when God hath spoken Peace, turn not again to Folly. <HI>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the Day of Redemp∣tion;</HI> but walk in him, and you shall not ful∣fil the Lusts of the Flesh. Do not boast as if your Work was done, and your War∣fare accomplished; but rather expect to meet with Temptations, and put on the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the Wiles of the Devil. Think it not strange, if God should hide his Face, after you have had the Light of his

Countenance lifted up upon you. This is no other Trial than what many of God's Children have endured. Be encouraged then to hear and obey that Word, Isa 50.10. <HI>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the Voice of his Servant, that walk∣eth in Darkness, and hath no Light? let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.</HI> Hope in God, and wait patiently for him, till he shall cause light to arise a∣gain unto you. And let none of these Things move you, neither count your Lives dear, that you may finish your Course with Joy.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us with humble Thank∣fulness behold that <HI>remarkable Work of Grace</HI> which I trust God is carrying on in this <HI>Town,</HI> and other Places; and be encouraged to seek the Lord more earnestly, that His Kingdom may come with Power by the more plentiful Effusions of his Holy Spirit; and that the Lord would rebuke Satan in all his Attempts to hinder or reproach this Work, and <HI>bruise him under our Feet.</HI> Let us bless God for His Spi∣rit &amp; Grace manifested in &amp; with <HI>His Servants</HI> that have preached the Gospel among us, and for the great Success which has attended their painful Labours. However, Let us not have Men's Persons in Admiration because of Ad∣vantage; but remember that Word, <HI>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.7. And accordingly, Let
<PB N="67" REF="004803_0037_100DF2303A28C758"/>
the Glory be given to the God of all Grace. And my Brethren, I apprehend we should reflect upon it as a Fault and Infirmity, that tho' you had such repeated Opportunities of hearing those <HI>worthy Persons,</HI> that yet one and another Assembly hath been crowded in such a manner, as even to make Distur∣bance on the Lord's-Day, while others have been in a considerable Degree left destitute. <HI>Finally Brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free Course and be glorified.</HI> And let the stated Provision of God's House be duely valued by you. Let your Zeal for the Ordinances con∣tinue, and be manifested in your constant and diligent Attendance on the publick Worship, in an especial Manner on the <HI>Lord's-Day.</HI> And when you wait upon God in the use of the Means of Grace, always bear in Mind those Words, <HI>I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to Profit,</HI> Isa. 58.17. And let that Apostolical Exhorta∣tion be duely regarded by you, <HI>We beseech you Brethren, to know them that labour a∣mong you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; And to esteem them very highly in Love for their Works sake. And be at Peace among your selves.</HI> 1 Thes. 5.12, 13. The more there is of mutual Esteem and Love between Ministers and their Peo∣ple, the fairer Prospect is there of the Suc∣cess of their Ministry. And the more con∣cern'd
<PB N="68" REF="004803_0038_100DF23206F36758"/>
we are to study the Things which make for Peace, the more likely shall we be to edify one another. When Brethren dwell together in unity, God commandeth the Blessing on <HI>Zion,</HI> See <HI>Psal.</HI> 133. Let us then avoid all unchristian Heats and Animosities, all rash judging and censuring one another: And in opposition to this, let all unite their best Endeavours, in their several Places, to promote the great Interest of pure and un∣defiled Religion; that Christ may increase, and his Kingdom flourish among us. And may it please the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ to bless you and all his People by fulfilling that good Word, Ezek. 39.29. <HI>Neither will I hide my Face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the House of Israel, saith the Lord God. And blessed be his glorious Name for∣ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory;</HI> Amen, <HI>and</HI> Amen!</P>

<Q>It is the Work of the Holy Spirit, to convince Men of Righteousness.</Q>
<P>Under this Doctrine and for the confirma∣tion of it, we may consider the following par∣ticulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. What is here intended by <HI>Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Shew that it is the Spirit who convinceth of <HI>Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Consider the Means which the Spirit useth to convince Men of <HI>Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="1">4. Offer some Description of this Work of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What is here intended by Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>I answer, <HI>the Righteousness of Jesus Christ.</HI> In this I think Expositours are generally a∣greed, and the 10th v. applieth it to Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="004803_0040_100DF23839ECC028"/>More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Spirit of God convinceth Men <HI>that Jesus of Nazareth is Christ the Righteous; the true Messiah, and no Impostor.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Words are understood by fome as especially intending Christ's own <HI>personal Righteousness.</HI> Jesus is the Son of God, and one with the Father in the essential Perfec∣tions and Rectitude of the divine Nature. <HI>I and my Father are one.</HI> John 10.30. And to him those Words, Psal, 45.6, 7. are applied, Heb. 1.8, 9. <HI>But unto the Son</HI> he saith, <HI>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom: Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniqui∣ty.</HI> And in his humane Nature taken into personal Union with his divine, he was per∣fectly free from all even the least Sin from his Conception and Birth, and thro'out his whole Life. Thus it was said to the blessed Virgin. <HI>The holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God</HI> Luk. 1.35. And as to his Life, none could ever convince him of Evil; for he did none, nor was Guile found in his Mouth. Yea, his holy Father who seeth in secret, saw no Defect or Blemish in him. <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</HI> Matth. 3.17. <HI>Such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, unde∣filed, separate from sinners,</HI> Heb, 7.26. In∣deed
<PB N="73" REF="004803_0040_100DF23839ECC028"/>
He was accused as a Deceiver a Blasphe∣mer, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners. But even then, Wisdom was justified of her Children, and there were some who beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the only begot∣ten of the Father. The Characters given of the <HI>Messiah</HI> unite in him, and the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> declareth concerning Him, <HI>Ye Men of Israel, hear these Words; Jesus of Naza∣reth, a Man approved of God among you, by Miracles, and Wonders and Signs, which God did by him in the midst of you,</HI> Act 2.2 2. And tho' he was numbred with the Transgressors, yet we must remember that he suffered the <HI>Just</HI> for the <HI>Unjust.</HI> The <HI>Messiah</HI> was cut off, but not for himself. Accordingly we find in the sacred History that <HI>Pilate</HI> his Judge pronounc'd him innocent; and <HI>Judas</HI> who had the greatest Advantages to know his Master's Life and Conversation, in great Hor∣ror confess'd that he had <HI>betrayed the innocent Blood.</HI> And when <HI>Peter</HI> charged the Jews with this horrible Crime, of <HI>denying the holy One and the Just,</HI> and desiring a Murderer to be granted unto them, great Numbers were convinced of their hanious Sin in cru∣cifying the Lord of Glory, and brought to trust in him as the true <HI>Messiah</HI> and only Saviour, <HI>Acts</HI> 2, 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there is in Christ a mediatorial Righteousness to be imputed to his People for their Justification before God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="004803_0041_100DEE3FC85ECAB0"/>And this is suppos'd by worthy Expositors to be principally intended in the Words. One of the glorious Titles given to our Lord Jesus is that, <HI>The Lord our Righteousness,</HI> Jer. 23.6. It was prophesied of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that he should finish the Transgression, make an end of Sins, make Reconciliation for Iniqui∣ty, and <HI>bring in everlasting Righteousness,</HI> Dan. 9.24. And it is no small Part of the Glory of the Gospel, that in it the <HI>Righteous∣ness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith,</HI> Rom. 1.16, 17. Here it is declared that the Son of God in our Nature was <HI>made Sin</HI> for his People, the Iniquities of God's People be∣ing laid upon him; that <HI>they might he made the Righteousness of God in him,</HI> having his perfect Righteousness imputed to them for their Justification, when they receive him by Faith. Indeed this great Doctrine was to the carnal Jews a stumbling-Block. <HI>For they being ignorant of God's Righteousness and going about to establish their own Righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the Righ∣teousness of God,</HI> Rom. 10.3. And it was to the <HI>Greeks</HI> Foolishness. They imagin'd it was an absurd Thing to trust in Christ for Righteousness, who was crucified as if he had been the vilest Malefactor. But now, when the Spirit of God has convinced his People of their Sin, and made them sensible that they must go out of themselves for Righteousness, he revealeth the Son to them, in whom God
<PB N="75" REF="004803_0041_100DEE3FC85ECAB0"/>
is reconciling the World to himself, not im∣puting their Iniquities; and maketh manifest <HI>the Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe,</HI> Rom. 3.21, 22. This divine Spirit sheweth them the Fulness, the Suffici∣ency of this Righteousness for their Justi∣fication; and enableth them, even when they have the deepest Sense of the greatness of their Sins, to rely upon Christ, that they may be accepted as Righteous with God. Thus it was with the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> after Christ was revealed unto him. Tho' he had some of the strongest Temptations to in∣dulge Confidence in the Flesh, yet he coun∣ted all loss for Christ. <HI>But what Things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all Things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.</HI> Phil. 3.7,— 9.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Righteousness may intend <HI>the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ communicated to his People for their Sanctification; and to make them meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="004803_0042_100DF23CDAA453E8"/>Christ is of God made unto his People <HI>Righteousness,</HI> also <HI>Sanctification.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.30. As they have His perfect Righteousness im∣puted to them for their Justification before God; so they derive <HI>inherent Righteousness</HI> from him when they are renewed after the Image of God. Our Lord Jesus is the Head of all gracious Influences, and with him is the Spring of our spiritual Life. <HI>It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.</HI> Col. 1.19. And <HI>of his fulness we receive, &amp; Grace for Grace,</HI> Joh. 1.16. Now when the Spirit of God hath convinced Men that they are by Nature empty of Grace, and utterly impotent to spiritual Good, he sheweth them also that Christ has purchased abundance of Grace and of the Gift of Righteousness to communi∣cate to his People; and that there is a Foun∣tain open'd in him to cleanse not only from the Guilt; but also from the Defilements of Sin, till Believers shall be presented Fault∣less before him. The holy Spirit convin∣ceth Men that Christ must be the <HI>Author and Finisher of Faith,</HI> and other Graces in them; and that tho' of themselves they can do no∣thing, yet that thro' Christ strengthning them, they may do all Things necessary to Sal∣vation.</P>
<P N="2">II. We proceed to shew, <HI>That it is the Work of the Spirit to convince Men of this Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="004803_0042_100DF23CDAA453E8"/>Here I may say, that it is the holy Spirit who maketh the effectual Application of the Redemption purchas'd by Christ to the Souls of Men. <HI>We are saved by the washing of re∣generation, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost,</HI> shed on us abundantly thro' Jesus Christ our Saviour, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5, 6. The Grace of our Lord Jesus, and the Love of God are brought home to his chosen People, by the Communion of the Holy Ghost. And in particular, the sa∣ving Evidence and Conviction of the great Doctrines of the Gospel respecting Christ's Person as God-Man, and respecting his Me∣diation, are from the same Spirit. Agreably, our Saviour declared to his Disciples, ver. 1.3. Cont. <HI>When He the Spirit of Truth come, he will guide you into all Truth.</HI> The Word is emphatical, and signifieth not only that the Spirit would discover these Truths in the Notion of them; but also that he would lead his Disciples into an experimental Acquain∣tance with them, so that they should live and act under the governing Influence of them. It follows, 14. v. <HI>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</HI> And therefore the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> prayeth to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Fa∣ther of Glory, to give to the christian <HI>Ephesi∣ans, the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, in the Knowledge of him, the Eyes of their Un∣derstanding being enlightned; that they might know what is the exceeding greatness of his

Power to them that believe,</HI> according to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.16,— 20. And the same Apostle speaking of Christ and him cruci∣fied, declareth that <HI>these Things are revealed by the Spirit:</HI> for the Spirit searcheth all Things, yea, the deep Things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10. As the Spirit moved on the Face of the Waters, when Darkness was on the Face of the Deep, and created the Light; so in the new Creation, he moveth on the Hearts of his People, and gives them the Light of the Knowledge of Christ and his <HI>Righteousness.</HI> The Spirit of God then is the Author of this Conviction. It is he that reneweth his Peo∣ple in Knowledge, when he forms the new Man in them. Agreably we read of the <HI>De∣monstration of the Spirit,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.4. And when the Apostle <HI>John</HI> had said that Christ <HI>came by Water and Blood,</HI> that he might save us both from the Guilt and Defilement of Sin; he further observeth in the same Verse; <HI>It is the Spirit that beareth Witness, because the Spi∣rit is Truth,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.6. It is the divine Spirit then who declareth to Men that we have Re∣demption thro' the Blood of Jesus, the For∣giveness of Sins.</P>
<P N="3">III. We may consider <HI>the Means which the Spirit of God useth to convince Men of Christ's Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="79" REF="004803_0043_100DF241E6BB4C68"/>1. The Spirit of God <HI>maketh use of his Word</HI> to convince Men of the Righteousness of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Our Saviour declareth that <HI>the Scriptures testify of him,</HI> John 5.39. And if we dili∣gently consult the Prophecies, Types and Promises of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> relating to the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and then compare them with the Revelation and History of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> we shall find a wonderful Harmony and A∣greement between them, and be obliged to acknowledge that in sending <HI>Jesus</HI> to save his People from their Sins, God has perform'd the Mercy promis'd to the Fathers, and re∣membred his holy Covenant. Now <HI>Pro∣phesy came not in old Time by the Will of Man: but holy Men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.21. Accordingly it is said of them who prophecied of the Grace which should come unto us; that they sear∣ched diligently <HI>what manner of Time the Spi∣rit of Christ, which was in them did signify, when it testifyed beforehand the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.10, 11. If we read, Psal, 22. Isa, 7.14.53. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9. and many other Prophe∣cies and Promises of the Old Testament, we shall see that the Spirit of God in and by his inspired Word did testify of Christ, and par∣ticularly of the perfect Righteousness which he was to bring in for the Justification of Sinners. <HI>By his Knowledge,</HI> by the Know∣ledge
<PB N="80" REF="004803_0044_100DF243E14B77D0"/>
of himself <HI>shall my righteous Servant justify many: for he shall bear their Iniquities.</HI> Isa <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 11. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24. Our Saviour while in the Exercise of his Ministry upon Earth, applied to himself the famous Prophecy we have recorded, <HI>Isa.</HI> 61.1, — 3. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the Poor, he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach Deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of sight to the Blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable Year of the Lord,</HI> Luk. 4 18, 19. ver 21, 2. <HI>This Day is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears. And ail bare him witness, and won∣dered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his Mouth.</HI> And after his Resurrecti∣on, when he had rebuk'd two of his Disci∣ples for being so slow of Heart to believe all that the Prophets had spoken, it is said, <HI>Be∣ginning at Moses and all the Prophets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures, the Things concerning himself,</HI> Luke 24.27. And it is plain our Lord accompanied his Word with the Light and Heat of his divine Spirit; for they said one to another, <HI>Did not our Heart burn</HI> within us, while he talked with us by the Way, and <HI>while he opened to us the Scriptures?</HI> Ver. 32. And after Christ's Ascension into Heaven, when the Spirit of God was poured out from on High, the Apostles and other Ministers of Christ did
<PB N="81" REF="004803_0044_100DF243E14B77D0"/>
evidently prove from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ, to the saving Conviction of great Numbers, and the Confusion of his implacable Enemies. Thus it was when the preaching of the Word was attended with the Power of the Holy Ghost. Many be∣lieved, and turned to the Lord. The full Evidence of Scripture, when thus impress'd on the Mind, can't be gainsayed. We read of <HI>Apollos</HI> who was mighty in the Scriptures, and fervent in the Spirit, that <HI>he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shew∣ing by the Scriptures, that Jesus was Christ.</HI> Acts 18 28. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us that there was a Vail over the Hearts of the <HI>Jews</HI> in reading of the Old Testament; which is done away in Christ, 2 Cor. 3.14. He then adds, ver. 18. <HI>We all with open Face, behol∣ding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> So clear and powerful is the Reflection of the Glory of Christ from the Word of God, when the Spirit removeth the Vail of spiritual Blindness. Now the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ shineth into the Heart, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of the Righteousness of Christ, <HI>by his Resurrection from the dead.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="004803_0045_100DF2467A19D720"/>We read of Christ, that he was <HI>delivered for our Offences, and was raised again for our Justification,</HI> Rom. 4.25. "By the Merit of his Death, he paid our Debt, in his Resur∣rection he took out our Acquittance" When he suffered on the Cross, the Sins of his Peo∣ple were laid upon him as their Surety, and had he not given full Satisfaction to divine Justice for them, he must have been held in the Prison of the Grave, he could never have risen from the dead. But Jesus is risen according to his Word and Promise, <HI>Destroy this Temple, and in three Days I will raise it up.</HI> Joh. 2.19. We have incontestible Proof of this important Fact in the holy Scriptures, particularly from many faithful Witnesses who sealed their Testimony with their Blood. Now this great Work of Christ's Resurrection is ascrib'd to the Father, to the Son himself; and he is also said to be <HI>quickened by the Spirit,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.18. And he is said to be <HI>declared to be the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead,</HI> Rom. 1.4. And indeed this is a strong Proof that our Saviour was the Person he professed himself to be, the Son of God by eternal Generation. Thus an Expositour observeth on the Place, "The Sign of the Prophet <HI>Jonas,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ's Resurrection, was intended for the last Con∣viction, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.39, 40.

Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> Accordingly when the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> would convince the <HI>Jews</HI> that Jesus whom they crucified, was the Christ, he declareth his Resurrection from the dead. <HI>He seeing this before, spake of the Resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, nei∣ther his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are wit∣nesses,</HI> Acts 2.31, 32. And the Spirit of God being then given to set home the Word on their Hearts, many were convinced, and bro't to repent and believe in Christ unto Sal∣vation, 37 <HI>to</HI> 41. Ver. Yea, of such great Moment is the Doctrine of the Resurrection of Christ, that the Evidence of the Truth of the Christian Religion very much depends upon it. <HI>If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</HI> 1 Cor. 15.14. And he repeateth it, Ver. 17. <HI>If Christ be not raised, then is your faith vain; ye are yet in your sins.</HI> And therefore the Apostle sets himself to prove this Doctrine in this Chapter. And in the 8th to the <HI>Romans</HI> he lays the greatest Stress upon it. <HI>Who is he that condemneth? It is, Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again?</HI> ver. 34. Here we see then that the Spirit of God in his inspired Word, maketh great use of Christ's Resurre∣ction as an Evidence of his being the true <HI>Me∣ssiah,</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="004803_0046_100DF24872544700"/>
and the only Name given under Heaven among Men, whereby we must be saved; and when he pleaseth to set home this Argument on the Hearts of Men, they conclude that in Christ, and him only there's a perfect Righ∣teousness for their Justification before God.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Spirit convinceth Men of the Righ∣teousness of Christ, by his <HI>Ascension into Hea∣ven, and Session at the Right Hand of God.</HI></P>
<P>— <HI>Of Righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more.</HI></P>
<P>When our Lord had thro' the Holy Ghost given Commandments unto the Apostles, and shewed himself alive unto them after his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assion, by many infallible Proofs, being seen of them Forty Days; <HI>He was taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their sight,</HI> Acts 1.9. And the Word of God declareth that he is set down at the Right Hand of the Majesty on high, and must reign till all E∣nemies are put under his Feet. Thus we see Jesus for the suffering of Death crown'd with Glory and Honour, and exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour. Now he could never have been receiv'd to the glorious Rest of Hea∣ven, had He not finish'd his Work on Earth Accordingly we re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>By his own Blood he entred in once into the holy Place, having ob∣tained eternal Redemption for us,</HI> Heb. 9.12.

Justification of Life for his People, the Man Christ Jesus could never have gone to Hea∣ven, powerfully to interceed for his People, and prepare a Place for them. He asks for nothing in the behalf of his People but what he has purchased, and bought by a valuable Price. Agreably, we have those two Parts of his Priestly-Office, his Obedience to Death, and the prevailing Power of his Intercession put together, as indeed they are dependent on each other. <HI>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous: And he is the Propitiation for our Sins: and not for ours only, but also for the Sins of the whole World,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. And thus while the Father heareth the Son, and distributeth Pardon and Grace to his People; Righteousness and Peace kiss each other. This is then an undeniable Evidence that Christ is approved and accepted of God in the great Work of our Redemption. Our Lord addeth, <HI>And ye see me no more;</HI> upon which a learned Divine observeth, <Q>If He had a∣scended without fulfilling all Righteous∣ness for the Church, he should have been sent down, and seen again; but now, saith he, you see me no more, for by once dying, and by once appearing in the End of the World, I have put away Sin by the Sacrifice of myself.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Edward Reynolds</HI> 110 Psal.</NOTE> And this is far∣ther

evident, in that the great Promise of the Holy Ghost was received by him, and the Spirit came down after his Departure, as sent from the Father in his Name, <HI>Job</HI> 14.26. Yea as sent by our ascended Savi∣our. <HI>If I depart, I will send him unto you,</HI> 7th Ver. Cont. And this brings me to the last Particular under this Head,</P>
<P N="4">4. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of the Righteousness of Christ <HI>by his Descent on the Apostles; by the miraculous Gifts he be∣stowed on them, and the wonderful Works he wrought by them.</HI></P>
<P>God giveth not the Spirit by measure to his Son, <HI>Job.</HI> 3.34. After his Baptism the Heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a Dove, and lighting upon him. By the Spirit of God he <HI>cast out Devils,</HI> Matth. 12.28. and did other wonderful Works. However there was an extraordinary Dispensation of the Holy Ghost which was not given till Jesus was glorified: And it is this which seems to be here espe∣cially intended as that which should give the highest Evidence and strongest Convic∣tion concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Righteousness. And here it may be ob∣served that tho' the Holy Spirit, being God, is in his Nature invisible; yet there were given sensible Tokens of his Presence in this wonderful Descent. <HI>And suddenly there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="87" REF="004803_0047_100DF24B37491380"/>
a sound from Heaven, as of a rushing mighty Wind, and it filled all the House where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, like as of Fire, and it sat upon each of them: And they were all filled with the holy Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</HI> Acts 2.2.—4. And while many of diffe∣rent Languages were amazed to hear the A∣postles speak the wonderful Works of God in their own Tongues, and others mocked. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> declared that this was the Work of the Holy Ghost given by our ascended Saviour. <HI>Therefore being by the right Hand of God exalted, and having recei∣ved of the Father the Promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</HI> 33. Ver. Thus they received Power from on high to publish the Gospel to to Nations whose Languages they knew not, till they were thus miraculously taught of God by his Spirit. And no doubt, with ex∣traordinary Gifts, there was also given to the Apostles by the same Spirit, a great Increase of spiritual Knowledge and Faith, Zeal and Courage, Humility and Patience, Love to God and Man, and other Graces, to carry them well thro' their Services and Sufferings for the Name of Jesus. Our Saviour promised his Disciples, that he would give them <HI>a Mouth and Wisdom which all their Adversaries should not be able to gainsay, orresist,</HI> Luk. 21.15.
<PB N="88" REF="004803_0048_100DF24CDA3D73F8"/>
And required them not to be anxiously con∣cern'd how or what they should speak when brought before Governours and Kings for his sake; for says our Lord, <HI>It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which is in you,</HI> Matth. 10.20. Accordingly when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> had wrought a wonderful Miracle in restoring a Man lame from his Mother's Womb, and <HI>Peter</HI> fill'd with the Holy Ghost, had declared that it was by the Name of Jesus, that the Man stood before them whole, and then that there was no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved: It is observed, Acts 4.13. <HI>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant Men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</HI> Yea, these Enemies of Christ were convicted by their own Consciences that a notable Miracle had been done, <HI>ver.</HI> 16. And no less wonderful was the Success of their Ministry, while the A postles went about thus miraculously furnished, and preached a cru∣cified Saviour. Behold a Number of poor Fishermen subduing the People of every Tongue and Language where they came; I say, subduing them to the Obedience of Faith! What Prejudices of Education were overcome! What violent Lusts and Passi∣ons conquered! How did great Numbers forsake all, yea Life it self, that they might
<PB N="89" REF="004803_0048_100DF24CDA3D73F8"/>
win Christ, and enjoy the Blessedness of the invisible World where He is! Such was the wonderful Success of the Gospel when preached <HI>with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven.</HI> Accordingly, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> ob∣serveth, <HI>That God hath chosen the foolish Things of this World, to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak Things of the World to confound the mighty; And base Things of the World, and Things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and Things which are not, to bring to nought Things which are.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.27, 28 Here those Words may be well applied, <HI>Not by Mighty, nor by Power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts,</HI> Zoch. 4.6 Now surely the Spirit of Truth and Holiness would never have wrought such Works of Grace by the preaching of the Name of Jesus, had not He been Christ the Righteous. 1 Tim. 3.16. <HI>Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was ma∣nifest in the Flesh, justifyed in the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. I would offer <HI>some brief Description of this Work of the Spirit, in convincing Men of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Now in this Work the Spirit of God doth not only give external Evidence in the Re∣velation of God's Word; but also applieth himself inwardly to the Heart, and opens the Understanding to discern these spiritual Things concerning Christ and his Righte∣teousness,
<PB N="90" REF="004803_0049_100DF24EE1D81BB8"/>
after a spiritual manner. So that such as are thus favoured, see the Son, and believe on him as the true Messiah and only Saviour, with that Faith which <HI>is the Evidence of Things not seen,</HI> Heb. 11.1. The Spirit of God enlightens the Minds of his People with the saving Knowledge of Christ and his Righ∣teousness. Agreeably the Apostle <HI>John</HI> de∣clareth, 1 Joh. 2.30. <HI>Ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all Things,</HI> i.e. All Things concerning Christ and the christiain Religion necessary to Salvation. The Spirit of God may be compared to <HI>Oyl,</HI> as this was used for Light, and in Medicine. The Spi∣rit heals the visive Faculty of the Soul, and removeth spiritual Blindness. He reneweth his People in Knowledge, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.10. There∣fore when our Lord had declared to the <HI>Lao∣diceans</HI> that they were blind, he counsels them to <HI>anoint their Eyes with Eye-salve, that they might see,</HI> Rev. 3.18. And when this Work is wrought by the Illumination of the Spirit, the Gospel-Revelation concern∣ing Christ and his Righteousness, appeareth in a new Light. The <HI>Sun of Righteousness ariseth</HI> upon the convinced Sinner, <HI>with heal∣ing in his Wings</HI> "or in his Beams". The Doctrine of God our Saviour appeareth in it's Reality, Importance and Excellency.</P>
<P>And accordingly,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="91" REF="004803_0049_100DF24EE1D81BB8"/>1. The <HI>Work of the Spirit in this Con∣viction, is a saving Work.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there may be some Perswasion of these Things from Education, there may be a notional Knowledge and historical Faith; yea we may have the common Illumination of the Spirit, and receive the Revelations of the Gospel with a transient Joy; and yet not see the glorious Beauty and divine Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, so as to count all Things but loss for the Excellency of the Knowledge of him. But when the Spirit convinceth Men of Righteousness in the Sense in which I now consider the Words, there is a Renovation of the Soul in all it's Powers by vital Princi∣ples and Habits of Grace infused; so that Men are <HI>called out of Darkness, into God's marvel∣lous Light.</HI> However, I do not suppose by this, that in passive Conversion the Spirit of God first giveth the Light of this saving Con∣viction of Christ, and then this Light worketh an habitual Change in the Will and Affecti∣ons. No, I humbly conceive that in passive Conversion there is the habitual Change of all the Faculties of the Soul wrought at once, by the divine Operation of the Holy Spirit: And then the Understanding, now savingly en∣lightned, beholds Jesus Christ, in order of Na∣ture before the Will &amp; Affections are drawn to close with him and cleave unto him; yea so as to incline them to act agreable to the Discovery made of this glorious Object.
<PB N="92" REF="004803_0050_100DF275AD8A3400"/>
This is then a saving Work of the Spirit of God. When <HI>Peter</HI> therefore had made that Confession of his Faith, <HI>Thou art Christ the Son of the living God.</HI> Our Lord pronounc'd him Happy, <HI>Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven,</HI> Matth. 16.16, 17. Thus;to know Christ is the be∣ginning of eternal Life, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this Work <HI>the Spirit of God giveth the convinced Sinner satisfying Evidence of Christ's Ability and readiness to justify and save all that come to God by him.</HI></P>
<P>He convinceth them that how many &amp; great soever their Sins have been, yet in Christ they may have a Righteousness every way suffici∣ent for their Justification before God, and to give them a sure Title to eternal Life, ac∣cording to the new and everlasting Covenant. While Men entertain slighty Tho'ts of the Evil of Sin, and of the Punishment due to them for it; they may also entertain law un∣worthy Apprehensions of Christ, and yet nou∣rish a carnal Confidence that He is both able and ready to save them: But when Men are convinced of the heinous Evil of Sin as it is an Offence against the infinitely glorious God, and so deserveth eternal Punishment; now they may be ready to say, Can this Man save us? Who is able to deliver us? Surely none but the Almighry God can re∣deem
<PB N="93" REF="004803_0050_100DF275AD8A3400"/>
us. Unless the Arm of the Lord be revealed, all our Hope of Deliverance is pe∣rished. But now, in this Article of Extre∣mity, the Spirit of God revealeth Christ as Jehovah our Righteousness, as the God of Sal∣vation, to whom belong the Issues from Death; and then the convinced Sinner is able to say, <HI>In the Lord have I Righteousness, and Strength.</HI> Now He seeth that He who is God hath purchas'd the Church with his own Blood, and given his Life a Ransom for many. And this maketh it manifest that God may be just and yet justify the Sinner that believeth in Jesus; yea, <HI>that thro' Faith in his Blood God declareth his Righteousness for the Remission of Sins,</HI> Rom. 3 25. And we have the Virtue of the Blood of Christ further declared by a Comparison from the legal Sacrifices. <HI>For if the Blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and the Ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the Unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the Flesh; How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the eter∣nal Spirit, offered himself without Spot to God, purge your Conscience from dead Works to serve the living God,</HI> Heb. 9.13, 14. If we under∣stand the eternal Spirit here, of the God-head of our Lord, this gave the highest Virtue and Value to his Offering. And then the Holy Ghost sanctified the Man Christ Jesus in an extraordinary manner to this great Work, &amp; strengthned him to the most perfect Exercise of Grace in the discharge of it. Ac∣cordingly

such as are convinced of Righte∣ousness, behold a Fountain of Merit and Grace open'd in Christ to wash away their Sins: They see that this divine Person is worthy to receive the Gift of the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ghost, in vir∣tue of his Obedience unto Death, that all the glorious Ends of His Mediation may be ac∣complished. Yea, the Spirit of God sheweth these Things in such an agreable as well as convincing Light, that the enlightned Mind is satisfied in this Way of obtaining the Justi∣fication of Life. This Light is sweet to the Soul, and the Believer determineth with the Apostle to know nothing <HI>save Jesus Christ, and him crucified</HI> See 1 Cor. 2.2. And then the Spirit of God convinceth Men of Christ's readiness to save all that go to God by him. And now, they receive the Calls of the Gos∣pel, not as the Word of Men, but of God, tho' Men may be the Instruments. Now they know Christ's Voice when He says, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, &amp; are heavy laden &amp; I will give you rest. All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out,</HI> Joh. 6.37. They are convinced that they have a divine War∣rant to bear them out in this important Act of trusting in Christ for Righteousness, and a divine Promise of eternal Life, upon their obeying the Gospel Call.</P>
<P>Which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="95" REF="004803_0051_100DEE46F1C5E1E0"/>3. <HI>Thus the Spirit of God maketh Men freely willing to receive and suhmit to Christ upon the Call and Offer of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Call is effectual. God's People are willing in the Day of His Power. They have the great Truths of the Gospel con∣cerning Christ and his Righteousness demon∣strated, and their Objections drawn from their own great Sinfulness, answered. And thus our Saviour taketh Possession of the Hearts of Men, not by Violence; but by a sweet, and yet powerful divine Influence whereby they are perswaded to embrace Him as the Lord their Righteousness. Being thus drawn by the Spirit, they freely go out to Christ re∣nouncing their own Righteousness as filthy Rags, and putting on this best Robe of Christ's Righteousness as every Way sufficient to co∣ver their Nakedness. <HI>It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every Man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me,</HI> Joh. 6.45. The enlightned Mind beholds our Lord Jesus as a most suitable and sufficient Saviour, the renewed Will makes choice of him, and the uniting Affections cleave to him.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE 1. From what hath been said <HI>We may learn the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="004803_0052_100DF251DD9735E8"/>The Old and New-Testament agree in bearing Witness to Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the great God our Saviour. And when our Lord ascended on high, he recei∣ved of the Father the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and sent him to convince Men of their great Sin in rejecting him by Unbelief, and then to shew them the perfect Righteousness which He had wro't out for the Justification of Sin∣ners before God, which must be the Righ∣teousness of One who is God-Man; for had he been a meer Creature tho' the most ex∣cellent, his Obedience had been due to God by the Law of Creation, and it would have been impossible for him to purchase e∣ternal Salvation for us. But the Word of God declareth, that <HI>being in the Form of God, he thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no Reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was made in the likeness of Men: And being found in Fashion as a Man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross,</HI> Phil. 2.6,—8. And this being the Case, his Obedience is strictly and pro∣perly meretorious; yea there is infinite Me∣rit in it to purchase eternal Redemption for us. And this is one of the deep Things of God revealed in the Gospel, and by the Holy Spirit. Our Lord was put to Death in the Flesh, but quickned by the Spirit,
<PB N="97" REF="004803_0052_100DF251DD9735E8"/>
and declar'd to be the Son of God, the Lord our Righteousness, by wonderful Operations of this divine Spirit sent in his Name after his Ascension into Heaven. Let us then o∣bey that Command of God, <HI>He is thy Lord, and worship thou him,</HI> Psal. 45.11 And let us join the heavenly Host, saying, <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory and Blessing,</HI> Rev. 5.12.</P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>Learn the heinous Sin and most dangerous Evil of rejecting Jesus Christ, and neglecting His great Salvation under the Gos∣pel Revelation.</HI></P>
<P>We have the strongest Evidence that Je∣sus is the Christ the only Saviour, in the Word of God. The Doctrines therein delivered concerning Christ, the History of wonderful Miracles and Works of Grace wrought by the Spirit in the Name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> put this beyond all reasonable Doubt. How great then is the Evil of rejecting Christ! Surely such as put the Gospel from them, <HI>judge themselves unworthy of everlasting Life. How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salva∣tion, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers Miracles, and Gifts of the holy Ghost, according to his own Will,</HI> Heb. 2.3, 4.
<PB N="98" REF="004803_0053_100DF254562F69B0"/>
And still the Sin and Danger of this is grea∣ter, when we have had the Spirit of God stri∣ving with us. When this is done against the Light and Conviction of our Consciences, it is highly provoking unto God; and when there is added over and above a malicious Oppo∣sition to the Holy Ghost in his divine Ope∣rations; this seems to contain in it the Ma∣lignity of that Sin which is unto Death, and shall not be forgiven. When our Lord there∣fore had cast out a Devil by the Spirit of God, and the <HI>Pharisees</HI> blasphemed, saying, <HI>This Fellow doth not cast out Devils, but by Beelzebuh the Prince of the Devils;</HI> he de∣clareth to them, <HI>that the Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto Men,</HI> Matth. 12.31. And we have that awful Word for our Warning; <HI>It is impossible for them who were once enlightned, and have tasted of the heavenly Gift, and were made Parta∣kers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance: seeing they cru∣cify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</HI> Heb. 6.4,—6. This falling away seems to refer to a total and wilful Apostacy join'd with a malicious Opposition to the Christian Religion after we have been convinced that it is of God, and have made a Profession of it. And there∣fore, <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fall in denying his Lord, and
<PB N="99" REF="004803_0053_100DF254562F69B0"/>
other heinous Transgressions of God's Chil∣dren, do not come under this Head. How dreadful then must be the Condition of such Apostates! How aggravated their Sin and Punishment! <HI>Of how much sorer Punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under Foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant, where∣with he was sanctified, an unholy Thing, and hath done despite to the Spirit of Grace,</HI> Heb. 10.29. O let us then take heed and beware of all Approaches towards this great Sin! Let us not indulge an Evil Heart of Un∣belief, nor resist the Spirit of God striving with us. But let not any that are seeking the Lord with trembling, imagine that this is their Case, and so discourage themselves, as if there was no Hope for them: But ra∣ther,</P>
<P>USE 3. <HI>Let such as are sensible of their Sin and Guilt, cry to God for his Spirit to give them the saving Knowledge of Christ, and his Righteousness; and to enable them to receive. Him as their only Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Hath the Spirit of God convinced you of your lost and perishing Condition? Pray to the Father then to open your Eyes to be∣hold his Son, who is come to seek &amp; save that which was lost: He who is mighty to save inviteth you to come unto him, and pro∣miseth he will in no wise cast out them that
<PB N="100" REF="004803_0054_100DF2560B9DA5E8"/>
come unto him. Do not say then, that your Hope is lost, and that you are utterly cut off; but rather resolve that you will look and wait for God's Salvation. Do not Attempt to patch up a Righteousness of your own; but cast away your filthy Rags, and go out unto Christ for <HI>white Raiment,</HI> that you may be clothed, and that the Shame of your Na∣kedness may not appear. Seek of God that <HI>fine Linnen, clean &amp; white, which is the Righ∣teousness of Saints,</HI> whereby they stand and are accepted as Righteous before God, even the Righteousness of Christ imputed, and re∣ceived by Faith. <HI>Put on Christ,</HI> and the holy God, looking on you as united to Him by a true and living Faith, will behold no Iniqui∣quity in you so as to enter into Judgment, and condemn you for it. <HI>There is no condem∣nation to them that are in Christ Jesus; who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</HI> Rom. 8.1. Go to Christ then and say, Lord, I am guilty, I can't conceal it. My own Heart condemneth me, and thou art greater than my Heart, and knowest all Things. But now I humbly and thankfully accept thine offer to be my Surety and Advocate with the Father. I put my Cause into thine Hand, O plead it, and answer for me! Let the Hand-writing which is against me be found cancel'd in virtue of thy precious Blood, and let me be found justified thro' the Redemp∣tion which is Christ Jesus. Lord I believe
<PB N="101" REF="004803_0054_100DF2560B9DA5E8"/>
that there's Virtue enough in thy precious Blood to wash away all my Sins, tho' they have been as Scarlet, and Red like Crimson: Help thou mine Unbelief! Thus do by God's Grace, and you may have <HI>Confidence to∣wards God now, and shall not be ashamed be∣fore him at his Coming.</HI> No, If you appear cloathed with the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, you shall be openly acquitted in the Day of Judgment. But then remember that to whom Christ is made of God <HI>Righteousness,</HI> he is also made <HI>Sanctification;</HI> and look to it that your Faith be that living Faith which purifieth the Heart, and worketh by Love. For <HI>that Faith which hath not Works is dead, being alone,</HI> James 2.17. And will leave you in a State of Death, and Damnation. That Faith by which God's Children depend en∣tirely upon the meritorious Righteousness of Christ for Justification before God, is also a vital Principle of new Obedience. Look unto Jesuus then, not only as to the <HI>Lord your Righteousness;</HI> but also as to <HI>your Head of Influence,</HI> of whose Fulness his People receive and Grace for Grace. When you go forth to meet the Bridegroom, look to it that you have the Oyl of saving Grace in your Hearts. Thus stand with your Lights burning, like unto Men that wait for their Lord; so shall <HI>you be found of your Judge in Peace, without Spot, and Blameless.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE III.</HEAD>
<Q>IT is the Work of the Holy Spirit to con∣vince Men of Judgment.</Q>
<P>Under this Doctrine we may consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. What are we to understand by Judg∣ment.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Means which the Spirit useth to convince Men of this Judgment.</P>
<P N="3">3. I shall give some brief Discription of this Work of the Spirit in convincing Men of Judgment.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What are we to understand by Judg∣ment?</HI></P>
<P>Ans. 1. <HI>We may understand it of that un∣just Judgment which Men pass'd on Jesus Christ, as if he suffer'd for his own Crimes, and his Disciples ought to suffer for confessing his Name before Men.</HI></P>
<P>We read of <HI>Jesus,</HI> that in his Humiliation, <HI>his Judgment was taken away,</HI> Acts 8.33. Tho' <HI>Pilate</HI> declared, having examin'd him before his Accusers, that he found no fault in him touching those Things whereof they accused him; yet the Voices of the Multi∣tude, and of the High Priests prevailed; so that <HI>Pilate</HI> gave Sentence it should be as they requested, <HI>Luke</HI> 23.34. Many were ignorant of the Gospel Revelation concern∣ing
<PB N="104" REF="004803_0056_100DF25B27EDD128"/>
Jesus Christ. <HI>Which none of the Princes of this World knew: For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.8. And the christian Re∣ligion is mention'd as <HI>a Sect</HI> or Heresy <HI>every where spoken against,</HI> Acts 28.22. Thus was the holy Jesus set <HI>for a Sign which should be spoken against,</HI> Luke 2.34. But when the Spirit of God came to discharge his Office as an Advocate in behalf of our ascended Saviour, he convinced many of the great Wrong they had done in this Matter, and rebuked them sharply; so that they were brought to judge and condemn themselves. Thus after our Lord had appeared to <HI>Saul,</HI> saying by a Voice from Heaven, <HI>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest,</HI> and the Spirit of God had wrought a thorough Change in him; he freely acknowledged <HI>that he had been a blas∣phemer, and a persecutor, and injurious,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. By Judgment we may understand <HI>the Power given to our Lord Jesus Christ to go∣vern the World, and to execute Judgment upon Satan, that grand Usurper, and all that ad∣here to him, in Opposition to the Kingdom of God.</HI> Agreeably it is said, II ver. <HI>Of Judg∣ment, because the Prince of this World is judged.</HI> After our Lord's Resurrection he said to his Disciples, <HI>All Power is given into me in Hea∣ven and in Earth,</HI> Matth. 28.18. When he ascended on High, he led Captivity Cap∣tive,
<PB N="105" REF="004803_0056_100DF25B27EDD128"/>
and broke the Power of the Enemies of our Salvation; so that they shall not be able to destroy so much as one of those little Ones who put their Trust in him. Here then it may be proper to observe, that the apostate Spirits who left their first Habitation are re∣presented in Scripture as united under one Head against Christ and his Kingdom. The <HI>Devil</HI> that old Serpent, beguiled <HI>Eve,</HI> and prevailed upon her to eat of the forbidden Fruit, and then by her enticed her Husband. We read, <HI>She took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her Husband, with her, and he did eat,</HI> Genesis 3 6. And thus were our <HI>first Parents</HI> drawn into a Rebellion against the Lord their Maker and great Benefactor, which must have been de∣structive to them and their sinful Progeny, had not God sent his Son <HI>to destroy the Works of the Devil.</HI> The first Promise of this was given to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> before they were cast out of the earthly Paradice, <HI>And I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and be∣tween thy Seed and her Seed: it shall bruise thy Head, and thou shalt bruise his Heel,</HI> Gen. 3.15. Here's a Sentence of Condemnation denounc'd against the Devil, and in the same Words a precious Promise of Deliverance made to God's People. <Q>This Seed is the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, who was to be born of a Woman being a Virgin, by the Operation of the
<PB N="106" REF="004803_0057_100DF25D85858B30"/>
Holy Ghost, to dispossess the Devil, thro' the Merit of his Death, and the Power of his Spirit, of all his Force.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dutch Annotations.</NOTE> According∣ly, <HI>When the Falness of Time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a Woman, made un∣der the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</HI> Gal. 4.4, 5. And as our Lord was sent to save the lost Sons and Daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> so to confound the accursed Plots and Devices of Satan, whereby he fought to en∣snare and ruin them forever. <HI>For as much then as the Children are Partakers of Flesh and Blood, be also himself likewise took part of the same: that thro' Death he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the De∣vil,</HI> Heb 2.14. Satan, by the divine Per∣mission, has the Power of Death as an Execu∣tioner. He is a Murderer, and a Destroyer. But now, the Son of God, having <HI>taken on him not the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of A∣braham,</HI> he died on the Cross that he might <HI>condemn Sin</HI> in the Flesh, which is the <HI>Sting of Death,</HI> bear the Curse of that <HI>Law</HI> which is the <HI>Strength of Sin;</HI> and so purchase Recon∣ciliation with God for his People, and the Gift of the Holy Ghost, to turn Sinners from the Power of Satan unto God. And thus Satan's Kingdom, which is founded on Sin, falls to
<PB N="107" REF="004803_0057_100DF25D85858B30"/>
the Ground, and his destroying Power over Man, is taken away. And therefore when the Time of our Lord's Death drew nigh, he said, <HI>Now is the Judgment of this World: Now shall the Prince of this Word he cast out,</HI> John 12.31. That is, <Q>My Death will be the Devil's Overthrow; will bring down Sin, and deliver the World from the Tyranny and Dominion of Satan.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Burkitt.</HI></NOTE> Our mighty Redeemer <HI>spoiled Principalities and Powers, and triumphed over them on the Cross,</HI> Col. 2.15. He has purchased a glorious Victory o∣ver Satan, and all our spiritual Enemies, Sin, this present evil World as under the Power the Devil, and Death. Agreably, our Lord said to his Disciples, <HI>In the World ye shall have Tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have over∣come the World,</HI> John 16.33. We read, <HI>I will ransom them from the Power of the Grave: I will redeem them from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plagues; O Grave, I will be thy Destruction,</HI> Hos. 13.14. And then the Word of God declareth, That our Lord <HI>must reign 'till all Enemies are put under his Feet,</HI> Psal. 110.1. <HI>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right Hand, until I make thine E∣nemies thy Footstool.</HI> And now the <HI>Father hath committed all Judgment to the Son.</HI> He
<PB N="108" REF="004803_0058_100DF26072CA80A0"/>
is the Judge, Lawgiver, and King of his Peo∣ple; and as the Lord strong and mighty will he go on conquering and to conquer his and his People's Enemies, 'till they shall be all put under him; and his People also shall have Dominion over them, in the great Day of Judgment.</P>
<P>Which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="3">3. We may understand it <HI>of the last and general Judgment, when our Lord Jesus Christ shall appear in the Glory of his Father, to judge the World in Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>We read, <HI>He bath appointed a Day, in the which he will judge the World in Righteous∣ness, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given Assurance unto all Men, in that he hath raised him from the Dead,</HI> Acts 17.31. While our Lord was upon Earth, he spake of this Judgment, <HI>When the Son of Man shall come in his Glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall be sit upon the Throne of his Glory. And before him shall be gathered all Nations;</HI> — Mat. 25.31, 32. And now he is risen and ascended, the Hea∣ven must contain him until the Time of Res∣titution of all Things, when there shall be an End put to the Disorder and Confusion bro't into the World by Sin, and all shall be obli∣ged to say, <HI>Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; Verily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth.</HI> And we have an Earnest of this in our Lord's Power to cast out Satan, and
<PB N="109" REF="004803_0058_100DF26072CA80A0"/>
in the wonderful Reformation wrought, when after his Ascension, He sent <HI>the Rod of his Strength out of Zion,</HI> his Word accompanied with his Spirit, and so rul'd in the midst of his Enemies See <HI>Psal.</HI> 110. But we do not as yet see all Things put under him, as they shall be in the great Day. <HI>Satan</HI> is still obeyed as the God of this World, and works in the Hearts of the Children of Dis∣obedience. <HI>Antichrist</HI>'s Reign has not a Pe∣riod put unto it. And to this Day, the <HI>dark Places of the Earth, are full of the Habitati∣ons of cruelty.</HI> So that even in the last Days, there are Scoffers who say in Derision, <HI>Where is the Promise of his Coming?</HI> But God by his Word and Spirit says to us, Behold, the Lord cometh! Jude 14, 1 5. <HI>v. And</HI> Enoch <HI>also, the seventh from</HI> Adam, <HI>prophesied of these, say∣ing, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints, To execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly Deeds which they have un∣godly committed, and of all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him.</HI> And in that great and terrible Day of the Lord, the Devil must be cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, to be tormented for∣ever and ever. This the <HI>Devils believe, and tremble.</HI> And then shall wicked Men have that dreadful Sentence pronounced and exe∣cuted upon them, <HI>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil
<PB N="110" REF="004803_0059_100DF2623408D4D0"/>
and his Angels,</HI> Matth. 25.41. Sinners have sometimes such a Conviction of this Judgment as makes them also tremble. As <HI>Paul rea∣soned of Judgment to come, Felix trembled,</HI> Acts 24.25. And then shall the Saints have their Judgment brought forth as the Light, and their Righteousness as the Noon-Day, when the King shall say unto them on his right Hand, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, in∣herit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World,</HI> Matth. 25.34. God's People shall have a compleat Victory over Satan, this present evil World, and the last Enemy Death. And all the Fruits of Sin and the Curse respecting them, shall be fully ta∣ken away, when <HI>Christ shall appear a second Time without Sin unto Salvation.</HI> And the Spirit of God now giveth them such a Con∣viction of this Judgment, that they look for that <HI>blessed Hope, and the glorious Appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I would consider <HI>some of the Means which the Holy Spirit useth to convince Men of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of Judgment by <HI>the miraculous Power given to the Apostles to cast out Devils in the Name of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>While our Lord was on Earth, he exerci∣sed this Power. He went about doing good, and <HI>healing all that were oppressed of the Devil,</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="004803_0059_100DF2623408D4D0"/>
Acts 10.38. He cast down Satan, and healed many that were under a bodily Possession. Thus our Lord cast many De∣vils out of a miserable Man in the Country of the <HI>Gaderenes,</HI> Luke 8.30. <HI>Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy Name? And he said Legion: because many Devils were entred into him.</HI> But at Christ's Command they were dis∣possessed, 33 <HI>v. Then went the Devils out of the Man.</HI> And when the <HI>Seventy</HI> returned, they said, Lord even the Devils are subject to us thro' thy Name. Upon which our Lord says, <HI>I beheld Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven.</HI> Luke 10.18. And after our Saviour Christ was exalted, this Power was wonderfully manifested by the Hands of the Apostles in the Name of Jesus. They bro't them which were <HI>vexed with unclean Spirits, and they were healed every one,</HI> Acts 5.16. <HI>Paul</HI> said to the evil Spirit that had possessed a Person as a Spirit of Divination; <HI>I com∣mand thee in the Name of Jesus to come out of her. And he came out the same Hour,</HI> Act. 16.18. Now the great Agent in this miraculous Work was the Spirit of God, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.28. And by it he convinced Men of the Dominion of our Lord Jesus over the Powers of Darkness.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of Judgment <HI>by the Light of the glorious Gospel, and the Works of Grace wrought by it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="004803_0060_100DF264874A1E90"/>The Evil Spirits are call'd <HI>the Rulers of the Darkness of this World,</HI> Eph, 6.12. Satan's King∣dom is founded on the Darkness of Sin, and sup∣porred by Ignorance and Error. Accordingly, The Holy Spirit useth the Light of his Word to subdue him. Thus our Lord said to <HI>Paul, I have appeared unto thee for this Pur∣pose, to make thee a Minister and a Witness both of these Things which thou hast seen, and of those Things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the People, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, To open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</HI> Acts 26.16,—18. Now it is the Spirit of God who furnisheth and sends forth these Ministers of Christ to shew Men the miserable Bondage they are under to Satan, and to invite them to come over to Christ, whom God hath set <HI>for an Ensign of the People,</HI> Isa. 11.10. Our Lord while on Earth was anointed by the Spirit to preach Deliverance to the Captives. And after his Ascension he sent forth his Apostles, and others to publish the glad Tidings of the Gospel. And by his Word accompanied with his Spirit, He broke in Pieces the Pow∣er of the Enemy. <HI>The Weapons of our War∣fare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God to the pulling down of strong Holds: Casting down Imaginations, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing that ex∣alteth</HI>

<HI>it self against the Knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every Thought to the obedience of Christ.</HI> The Instruments indeed were the weak Things of the World, that the Glory of the Victory might be given to Christ. <HI>We have this Treasure in earthen Vessels, that the Excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.7. Some suppose that here is an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>Gideon</HI>'s little Army that marched against the migh∣ty Host of <HI>Midian,</HI> with Trumpets, Lamps and Pitchers: They blew the Trumpets, brake the Pitchera, and held up the Lamps, crying, <HI>The Sword of the Lord, &amp; of Gideon.</HI> And the God of Armies routed their formidable Ene∣mies, <HI>Judges</HI> 7. Thus Christ's Ministers who are as their Brethren, form'd out of the Clay, hold up the Light of the Gospel, and cry a∣loud as they are directed; and when the almighty Spirit is pleased to work with and by them, the Powers of Darkness flee be∣fore them, as the Shades of Night are cha∣sed away before the springing Day, and ri∣sing Sun. Thus was Satan cast out of the Gentile World. His Oracles were struck Dumb, his Temples and Altars were deser∣ted, and many <HI>turned to God from Idols, to serve the living and true God,</HI> and to wait for his Son from Heaven. We read that ma∣ny who used curious Arts, "the study of Magick and Divination", burned their Books, when the Word of God prevailed; tho' the
<PB N="114" REF="004803_0061_100DF2665A127BF8"/>
Price of them was counted, and found to be 50,000 Pieces of Silver, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.19, 26. And by the way, when the Word of God pre∣vaileth among you, the Spirit will convince you of the Evil of reading Romances, Plays and other lewd Books. To return. When Satan was cast out of <HI>Rome-Pagan,</HI> he gave his Power to the Beast, to <HI>Antichrist</HI> and so set himself again in Opposition to Christ, &amp; his Kingdom. But our Lord has in a good mea∣sure consumed him with the Spirit of his Mouth, the Sword of the Spirit going out of his Mouth, in his preached Gospel. The Apostle <HI>John</HI> saw in Vision <HI>an Angel fly in the midst of Heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth,</HI> Rev. 14 6 By which we may un∣derstand "the faithful Witnesses of Christ and Teachers of the Gospel" who publish the pure Doctrines of God's Word in Op∣sition to the Errors and Heresies of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Angels of the Churches, and Messengers of Christ. And after this, another Angel crieth, <HI>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</HI> 8 <HI>v.</HI> Thus doth the Spirit of God by his Word plead the Cause of Christ against his Enemies, and convince the Obstinate to their Confusion, that our Lord is above them, even in those Things wherein they deal most proudly: And thus doth He give his People an evident Demon∣stration of the Authority of Christ to execute Judgment against the great Enemy of their
<PB N="115" REF="004803_0061_100DF2665A127BF8"/>
Souls. Now it appears that Christ is stron∣ger than the strong One, while the Devil is thus cast down from his usurped Throne in the Hearts of Men. <HI>When a strong Man ar∣med keepeth his Palace, his Goods are in Peace. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his Armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his Spoils.</HI> Luke 11.21.22. The Words may be fitly applied to the Destruction of Satan's Power both respecting the Bodies and Souls of Men.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Spirit of God convinceth Men of this Judgment <HI>by judicial Dispensations of Providence.</HI></P>
<P>God is known by the Judgments which he executeth. And it hath pleased the Fa∣ther to commit this Judgment to the Son, the Power of punishing his and his People's implacable Enemies, and of correcting his Covenant-People. The Apostle <HI>Pauls</HI> says, respecting God's own People, <HI>When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the World,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.32. Now by these providential Dispen∣sations the Spirit of God pleads the Cause of Christ, as the Judge of the World, and as the Lord and Lawgiver of his Church; and convinceth Men of the Necessity of submit∣ting to his golden Scepter, left they be bro∣ken to Pieces with his iron Rod. When
<PB N="116" REF="004803_0062_100DF2698342A010"/>
Judgment begins at the House of God, There's a loud Call to the Wicked to con∣sider, <HI>What shall be the End of them that Obey not the Gospel of God?</HI> Where shall the Ungodly and the Sinner appear? See 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.17, 18. And thus are Sinners some∣times brought to make Supplication to their Judge, sensible that it must be a fearful Thing to fall into his Hand as an Avenger of Sin. And when the Children of God behold how the Lord puts away the Wicked like Dross, they cry out with the Psalmist, <HI>My Flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> Now they are quickned to serve the Lord with Reverence, and con∣cern'd to make it evident to themselves that they are not of those who must be led forth with the Workers of Iniquity in the great Day of Judgment.</P>
<P N="3">III. I proceed in the last Place to <HI>give some brief Description of this Work of the Spirit in convincing Men of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Spirit the divine Author of this Work, is called <HI>the Spirit of Judgment,</HI> Isa 4.4. And he may be so call'd in part as he convinceth of Judgment. And in this Work the holy Spirit brings home the Evidence of this Judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ by an inward Application to the Heart and Conscience, in legal or saving Conviction.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="004803_0062_100DF2698342A010"/>I. In this Work <HI>the Spirit of God shew∣eth the Sinner that while he refuseth to sub∣mit to Christ as his Lord Redeemer, he is under the Power of Satan, who is leading him Captive to Hell.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil is call'd the <HI>Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now work∣eth in the Children of Disobedience,</HI> Eph. 2.2. He is here describ'd as one having others under him, the Prince of Devils, as having been we may suppose the Arch-Traitour and Leader of Rebellion to the Apostate Spi∣ris. His Power is confin'd to this lower World, and is exercis'd over such as conti∣nue in Disobedience towards their rightful Lord. He may tempt God's Children; but he reigns only in the Hearts of rebellious Sinners: These he leads Captive at his Will; but alas! They are very insensible of it. The most do not know, will not consider, that this old Serpent seeks to beguile and cheat them of their precious Souls by his Temptations from the Pleasures, Riches and Honours of this World; and that while he gratifieth the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, he holds them fast by these vile Lusts, as in Chains of Dark∣ness. But when the Holy Spirit cometh on Men to deliver them from the destroying Power of this unclean Spirit, he opens their Eyes, and sheweth them this <HI>evil One</HI> in his own Colours. And now they are made
<PB N="118" REF="004803_0063_100DF26BF267C730"/>
sensible that as a <HI>roaring Lion,</HI> he seeks to devour them; and that none can deliver them but the Lord Jesus, who is call'd the <HI>Lion of the Tribe of Judah.</HI> Now they feel that this <HI>fiery Serpent</HI> hath injected his deadly Poyson into their Souls, and that with the stung <HI>Israelites</HI> they must perish, unless they look to the Son of God, who was lifted up on the Cross.</P>
<P>Which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Holy Spirit revealeth Jesus Christ to Sinners as their only and Almighty Redeem∣er.</HI> The Spirit of God convinceth them of the Truth of that Word, <HI>For asmuch then as the Children were Partakers of Flesh &amp; Blood, he also himself likewise took Part of the same: that thro' Death he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil; And deliver them who thro' Fear of Death were all their Life-Time subject to Bondage,</HI> Heb. 2.14, 15. And that Christ is able to bring forth Judgment to Victory, by rescu∣ing miserable Sinners, and so taking the Prey out of the Hand of the Mighty.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Spirit of God enableth his People to submit to Christ as their Prince and Savi∣our, renouncing the Devil and all his Works.</HI></P>
<P>They can say, tho' this cruel Lord has had the Dominion over us, yet now will we make
<PB N="119" REF="004803_0063_100DF26BF267C730"/>
mention of the Name of Christ, as our only rightful Lord and Master. And they are willing that those Lusts whereby Satan held them, should all be slain before the Lord; because these also are Enemies to Christ. Thus they go over to Christ, to list under his Banner, whom God hath given to be a <HI>Leader and Commander to the People,</HI> to bring many Sons to Glory, as the Captain of their Salvation. <HI>They are willing in the Day of God's Power,</HI> Psal. 110.3. In this respect, they are not as press'd Men; but as Volun∣teers freely offer themselves, and so <HI>come to the help of the Lord, against the Mighty.</HI> By the Evidence of the Spirit they discern clear∣ly that the Service of Satan is vile Slavery, and the Wages Death; and accordingly they desert him with an holy Indignation, and a a Desire of taking an holy Revenge of him: They also see that the Service of Christ is glorious Liberty, and the gracious Reward, eternal Life; and accordingly they willingly subscribe their Hand to the Lord, and enter into an Oath that they will be for him and for no other. And thus are they <HI>delivered from the Power of Darhness, and translated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son,</HI> Col. 1.13. Satan is cast down, and cast out of their Hearts; so that tho' he may tempt, he shall never a∣gain usurp Dominion over them. The Son of God in Opposition to this Usurper, cometh into their Souls, and taketh Possession of them
<PB N="120" REF="004803_0064_100DF26E9782E008"/>
as his own. And they are enabled to open the everlasting Doors of their Hearts, that the King of Glory may come in. They say to the Son and Lord of <HI>David,</HI> something as <HI>Amasai</HI> to King <HI>David,</HI> when the Spirit came upon him; <HI>Thine are we</HI> David, <HI>and on thy side: Peace, Peace be unto thee, and Peace be to thine Helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.</HI> Nor doth the Noise of War discourage them; for now the Spirit gives them a View of Christ as the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle. They realise it that there can be no true Safety, no Victory, no Triumph; but in abiding loyal to Christ, and standing firm on his side.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Spirit of God convinceth his Peo∣ple of this Judgment, <HI>by bruising Satan un∣der their Feet more and more, and by giving them the lively Hope of a compleat Victory over him, and all their Enemies, at the Day of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>God's People under this Conviction of the Spirit, behold Satan as a conquered Enemy, and believe that God will fulfill his Word <HI>by bruising him under their Feet.</HI> And they happily find that he that has begun the good Work is carrying it on towards Perfection against all Opposition from their spiritual E∣nemies. The Spirit of God inspireth them with Courage and Skill to resist the Devil stedfastly. He teacheth them to Fight the
<PB N="121" REF="004803_0064_100DF26E9782E008"/>
Battles of the Lord, looking to Jesus Christ that they may <HI>be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might.</HI> He enableth them to use their spiritual Weapons with Dexte∣rity and Success. He enableth them to <HI>put on the whole Armour of God,</HI> that they may be able to stand against the Wiles of the Devil. To take the <HI>Shield of Faith,</HI> where∣with they quench the fiery Darts of the Wicked; and the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> which is the Word of God. The Spirit of God also is in his People a <HI>Spirit of Supplication,</HI> helping their Infirmities, and exciting them to cry to the Lord for Grace and Strength to help them, while they are wrestling against the Rulers of the Darkness of this World. And thus do they receive fresh Supplies and Succours from the Lord, in their times of Need. Agreeably, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> de∣clareth, <HI>That</HI> God's People are <HI>more than Con∣querors, thro' Him that loved them.</HI> For I am perswaded, says he, that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things pre∣sent, nor Things to come, shall be able to separate us from the Love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. And the same A∣postle gives Thanks to God, who always <HI>caused them to triumph in Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 2.14. Our Jesus, our <HI>Joshua,</HI> even now causeth his People to put their Feet upon the Necks of their spiritual Enemies, and giveth them the Assurance of a compleat Victory and Tri∣umph,
<PB N="122" REF="004803_0065_100DF270DDE83830"/>
when they shall sit on Thrones, judg∣ing the World. 1 Cor. 6.2, 3. <HI>Do ye not know that the Saints shall judge the World? Know ye not that we shall judge Angels?</HI> "They may first be acquitted, says an Ex∣positor on the Place, and then advanced to the Bench, to approve and applaud the righ∣teous Judgment of Christ, both on Men and Angels."</P>

<P>USE 1. Doth the Spirit of God convince Men of their unjust Judgment concerning Christ? <HI>Let us then ask the Spirit to give us a right and sound Judgment concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, his Person, Offices and Works.</HI></P>
<P>Since the Fall, Men are <HI>alienated from the Life of God, thro' the Ignorance that is in them,</HI> because of the Blindness of their Heart, Eph. 4.18. And in a particular manner, they are prone to entertain strong Prejudices against Christ, and the Way of Salvation by him. And Satan, if God permit, will be active in tempting them to entertain false Opinions concerning the only Saviour, that if possible he may hinder them from believing in him to the Salvation of their Souls. <HI>In whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto them,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.4.

let us then beseech the Lord to grant us the Light and Influence of his good Spirit, that we may have right Apprehensions of the Son of God, and not have our Minds corrupt∣ed with any false Doctrines relating to the Union of his divine and humane Nature in one Person, or the great End of his Death, or his Ability and Readiness to save even the Chief of Sinners. Lest that should come up∣on us which is spoken of in the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and was fulfilled in many of God's ancient Peo∣ple, <HI>Behold, ye Despisers, and wonder, and perish: For I work a Work in your Days, a Work which you shall in no wise believe, tho' a Man declare it unto you.</HI></P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>Let what hath been said awaken secure Sinners, who are going on in Acts of Re∣bellion against the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>How great is your Sin and Danger, while you stand in Opposition to the Lord Jesus, <HI>to whom the Father hath committed all Judg∣ment!</HI> What is this, but to set Briars and Thorns against consuming Fire? And who is it you are confederate with, in this accur∣sed Rebellion? With Satan, the sworn E∣nemy of God and Man; who is also a con∣quer'd Enemy, <HI>reserved in everlasting Chains of Darkness, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</HI> O, awake then, and cry for Mercy!

he shall enter into Judgment with you. He will overcome when he judgeth. There lieth no Appeal from his Sentence, nor can any deliver out of his Hand. Now then, while he is seated on a Throne of Grace, make Peace with him, and accept of Pardon upon Gospel Terms; lest you have Judg∣ment without Mercy in the terrible Day of the Lord, and with Amazement <HI>say to the Mountains and Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb: For the great Day of his Wrath is come; and who shall he able to stand?</HI> Rev. 6.16, 17. <HI>Kiss the Son</HI> lest he be angry, and you perish from the Way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that put their Trust in him.</P>

The Son of God in our Nature, hath encountred and over∣come the Tempter; and it is declared of him, <HI>A bruised Reed shall be not break, and smoaking Flax shall be not quench, till he send forth Judgment unto Victory,</HI> Matth. 12.20. He himself hath suffered being tempted, and therefore is able to succour you under your Temptations. O Child of God! Be not dis∣couraged, either at the Number, or Power and Policy of your spiritual Enemies. Stronger is he that is in you, than he that is in the World. Be strong in the Lord then, and in the Power of his Might. Go forth against these Enemies in the Name of the Lord; thro' Him shall you do valiantly, and tread them under that rise up against you. Let this then animate you to fight the good Fight of Faith, and endure Hardness as good Sol∣diers of Jesus Christ. His Arm, and the Light of his Countenance will give you the Victory. And let God's People under the present dark Aspects of divine Providence, behold <HI>all Judgment committed to the Son,</HI> and realise it that He governs all Affairs even those which appear most intricate and per∣plexed, with unerring Wisdom, irresistible Power, and with a tender Concern for the Salvation of his People; so that in the End, Zion shall arise and shine, with the Glory of the Lord risen upon her; and her Ene∣mies shall lick the Dust.

<P>USE 4. Let such as are under a prepara∣tory Work of Conviction, <HI>Look unto Jesus to bruise Satan under their Feet.</HI></P>
<P>Be not dismayed if you should find a vi∣olent Struggle, when our Lord is coming by his Spirit to deliver you from the destroy∣ing Power of Satan. But encourage your selves to seek the Lord more earnestly that He would rebuke the Tempter, and not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able to bear. Do not listen to the Suggesti∣ons of this evil One; but look to Jesus to ex∣ecute Judgment upon him. If he tempt you to hurt your Bodies, hearken to that Word, <HI>Do thy self no Harm.</HI> Or if he should tempt you to destroy your Souls by Presumption or Despair, reject his evil Motions with Abhor∣rence, and labour to cherish the Motions of the good Spirit of God in Opposition to him. Be not afraid to Worship God in Secret, lest he should appear to you; but consider, our Saviour holds him as in a Chain, and can con∣troul him at his Pleasure. Say to the Lord, <HI>Rule thou over us,</HI> and let this Usurper be cast out of our Hearts. And pray God to subdue every Lust, that there may be none retain'd

<P>USE 5. Let us all be exhorted <HI>to submit to Christ as our rightful Lord, and to stand on his side against the Devil and his Angels.</HI> There are two Kingdoms which divide the whole World, the Kingdom of God's dear Son, and the Kingdom of Darkness. And we must belong to the one, or the other. Here none may presume that they can stand Neuter. If you refuse to stand on Christ's Side, you must expect to be treated as E∣nemies to him. Here then, I set before you Life and Death, Blessing and Cursing. If you continue under the Power of Satan, you must finally perish with him in Hell. But if you now submit to Christ, you shall obtain the Blessings of the Kingdom of Grace, and in due Time be advanced to the Kingdom of Glory, where there is <HI>neither Adversary, nor Evil occurrent.</HI> Be persuaded then to stand on this Side, and you will have the best Cause, the best Leader, and certain victory in God's Time. The Reward of which is not a <HI>fading Laurel;</HI> but a <HI>Crown of Glory</HI> which fadeth not away.</P>

Flee youthful Lusts which War against the Soul; and while you strive for the Mastery, be temperate in all Thing. When Satan tempts you to walk in the Ways of your Heart, and after the Sight of your Eyes, re∣alise it that for these Things <HI>God will bring you into Judgment;</HI> and then say, How can I do this Wickedness, and Sin against God? How shall I be able to lift up my Head, when I must appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ? Thus resist the Devil, and he shall flee from you. O how lovely a Sight is it, to behold our Youth denying the Sollicita∣tions of Satan, when he urgeth them to gra∣tify their carnal Appetites, in this Age of Pleasure! <HI>I have written unto you, Fathers, because ye have known him that is from the Beginning.

And for your further En∣couragement, I may observe to you, That in the holy Army of <HI>Martyrs</HI> who overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, we have some heroic Examples of Courage and Firmness of Mind even among Women, and that when call'd to resist unto Blood, striving against Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Let our Aged go forth against the Enemy,</HI> and fight the Lord's Battles. There's no Discharge in this War. No, you must be faithful to Death. And if any, we may well expect, that <HI>old Disciples,</HI> who have for a long time followed Christ, should resist the Devil with holy Courage and Skill, as not being ignorant of his Devices. A few Con∣tests more, and you shall be able to say with <HI>Paul</HI> the Aged, <HI>I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that Day,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.7, 8.</P>

Now then, that God has bro't you out from the dark Places of the Earth, where Satan had his Seat, to a Land of Gospel-Light, where it is declared that the Son of God was manifest in the Flesh, and hath <HI>redeemed a People to God by his Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation;</HI> seeing this is the hap∣py State of Things, despise the Slavery of the Devil, shake off the Chains of Darkness in which you have been bound, and cry to your Saviour, that you may be <HI>delivered from the Bondage of Corruption,</HI> into the <HI>glorious Liberty</HI> of the Children of God. Come over to Christ, and you shall also overcome, and sit down with him on his Throne.</P>
<P><HI>Let Parents and Masters of Families, sub∣mit to Christ,</HI> and train up their Children, and all under their Care for his Service.</P>
<P><HI>And Let the Pastors of the Churches be exhorted to lead forth their Flocks in Opposition to the Powers of Darkness;</HI> and do your utmost by Purity of Doctrine, by the Exercise of an

<P>In a Word and to conclude, In this re∣markable Season, let us be earnest with God for the more plentiful Effusions of his Spirit, that there may stand up an <HI>exceeding great Army</HI> to fight the Battles of the Lord, and take the Kingdom of Heaven with an holy Violence. <HI>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O most Mighty: with thy Glory and thy Ma∣jesty. And in thy Majesty ride prosperously, because of Truth, Meekness and Righteousness: And thy right Hand shall teach thee terrible Things.

Rule thou in the mids of thine Enemies, and make thy People willing in the Day of thy Power.</HI> And let us avoid every Thing that has a Tendency to quench the Spirit, and so to hinder the Success of the Gospel. Let us remember that true Godli∣ness hath its Influence on the whole Con∣versation. And accordingly, let us seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness, and then look well to the Ways of our Housholds, and take Care that we, our Chil∣dren and Servants, be well employed in the particular Business to which God calls us. Let Children be well govern'd. Let them duly attend the School, and be in subjection

Consider, the Fruit of the Spirit is <HI>Love, Joy, Peace, Long suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith,</HI> And they that are Christ's, <HI>have crucified the Flesh, with the Affections and Lusts.</HI> Let the Children of God quicken their Pace in the Way towards Heaven, saying with the Apostle, <HI>I count not my self

And let such as are under good Impressions from the Spirit, take heed to themselves, and beware of Apostacy. O ponder those awful Words! <HI>If any Man draw back, my Soul shall have no Pleasure in him,</HI> Heb 10.38. But if there should come <HI>a falling away</HI> respecting some that have pro∣mised fair, let us not be shaken in Mind as if the main Work was not of God; nor take up an evil Report against it. Scripture and Experience warn us to fear and prepare for such a Trial. But <HI>O thou God of all Grace, keep us from falling! Let thy Work appear more and more to thy Servants, and thy Glory unto their Children:</HI> Confirm, increase and per∣fect it to the Praise of thy glorious Grace.</P>
<P>And may our Lord utterly <HI>destroy Anti∣christ</HI> by the Brightness of his Coming! May He <HI>bind Satan,</HI> and cast him into the bottom∣less Pit! And may that Voice be heard, say∣ing, <HI>The Kingdoms of this World are be∣come the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever. Amen, Even so, Come</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
