<HEAD>Admiral BUCKNER, <HI>sworn.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you know Richard Parker, the Prisoner?—<HI>A.</HI> I do.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did the prisoner belong to the Sandwich?—<HI>A.</HI> He did.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What station was he in?—<HI>A.</HI> I do not know what capacity he was in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Repeat what you know of the prisoner's being con∣cerned in a mutiny on board the Sandwich, and of any suspected conduct either on board or on shore, on or a∣bout the 12th of May, or of any instances of disrespectful language or conduct to his officers during the time this mutiny existed? <HI>A.</HI> The first time I observed any thing particular in the Prisoner's conduct, (further than pa∣rading about with a vast number of people on shore, with a red flag) was, on or about the 20th of May, when I went on board the Sandwich, for the purpose of making known to that ship and other's his Majes∣ty's proclamation of pardon, on their returning to their duty, on the terms granted to their brethren at Spit-head, which the Delegates, (among whom was Parker) had previously assured me they would be satisfied with. On my going on board with my flag in a boat, there was no respect shewn me whatever. The officers were then without their side arms, and had no com∣mand in the ship. Unwilling to return on shore till an opportunity offered for my speaking to the people, I waited for a considerable time, when Parker, with others, came on the quarter-deck and said, that none
<PB N="5" REF="032837_0004_0FF554D2E7117318"/>
others but themselves, (meaning, I presume, the ship's company) should be present. The prisoner then ten∣dered me a paper, containing what he and others called a list of grievances, saying, at the same time, until those were redressed, they would not give up the pow∣er that was then in their hands. They insisted also on having it ratified by the Admiralty. Finding my ef∣forts to restore order were of no avail, I went on shore. On the 22d, certain troops arrived at Sheerness. On the 23d, my flag was struck on board the Sandwich. On the evening of that day, I was at the Commission∣er's house, and while I was
inquiring into complaints alledged against two marines, that were brought in by a party of the Military, the Prisoner, and a man whom they called Davis, with three or four others, I believe, came abruptly into the house, and demanded why those men were in custody, telling me at the same time, that my flag was struck—that I had no authority, and that the power was in their hands. They then took the men away, as they said, to trial. An expression made use of by Parker was, that he was not to be intimi∣dated. About the 4th of June, I received a letter from Parker, stating him as President of the Commit∣tee of Delegates.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you receive it from Parker?—<HI>A.</HI> It was signed with his name: that letter stated, that Admin∣istration had acted improperly in stopping the provisions allowed the men, and that the foolish Proclamation was calculated to enflame the minds of honest men.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What Proclamation?—<HI>A.</HI> The King's Procla∣mation, it could be no other, he did not say that; but he meant it. I have given you the detail, and have nothing more particular to relate—I have had frequent conferences with the Prisoner, and many others of them, and talked to them, in order to bring them to a sense of their misconduct, without any good effect; he in general took the lead as the spokesman, with a degree of insolence.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was there always a degree of insolence?—<HI>A.</HI> Not always, sometimes there was. He appealed to the rest, whether he was not authorised to speak the sense of the whole, and if it was their wish it should be so;
<PB N="6" REF="032837_0005_0FF554D472F9F510"/>
And even prevented one man in particular, whose name I do not know, from answering a question I had put to him, he prevented him with threats: he turned round and said to him, at the same time. "Hold your tongue; if you do not, I'll take care of you," or words to that effect. While I was on board the Sandwich, I forgot to mention, that I remonstrated with the Prisoner, a∣bout keeping those disgraceful ropes called yard-ropes, hanging; but the Delegates, among whom was the Prisoner, refused to remove them. I tried to prevail on them to return to their duty, their answer was, that the ship's company would not suffer them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was it with Parker?—<HI>A.</HI> It was him as well the rest, they were all standing together, the men who styled themselves Delegates.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In your conversations with him, did he ever ap∣pear with a degree of insolence?—<HI>A.</HI> He frequently did, but not uniformly; sometimes with a great deal of modesty, and of apparent respect, but very often otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was Lieutenant Justice the officer who brought the report of the mutiny breaking out on the 12th of May?—<HI>A.</HI> He was the officer who brought the ac∣count of the breaking out of the mutiny in the Sand∣wich.</P>
<P><HI>The Court wishes Admiral Buckner's Letter to be read</HI> (it was ready and two others, the substance of which was stated in Admiral Buckner's evidence.</P>
<P><HI>The following Letter from Richard Parker to Admiral Buckner, was read also.</HI></P>
<P>"Vice Admiral BUCKNER. Sir, I am command∣ed to inform you, that we have this day taken the opinion of the Delegates of the Fleet, they universally agree, that the conduct of Administration has been highly improper in slopping the provisions allowed the seamen, and that the foolish Proclamation which we have received, tends only to exasperate the minds of honest men who are serving their country. I am, Sir, Your humble servant, RICHARD PARKER." Sheerness.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you believe the letters now read to be origi∣nal?—<HI>A.</HI> I do, I have no reason to doubt it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Prisoner</HI> PARKER'S <HI>Questions.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> The Admiral mentions being on board the Sandwich, on the 20th of May, and having been re∣ceived with no respect on coming on board; I wish to ask, who was on board first on that day, you or I?<HI>A.</HI> I believe I was on board first.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I would beg leave to ask, do you think I was the person who caused you to be received with no respect?—<HI>A.</HI> I meant to say, that I was not received as I ought to be, I was received without a guard; as to the Prisoner, I was on board before him, and they attended me with a number of flags, not red flags, but union. I cannot answer the question the Prisoner puts, because I was on board before him.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you deem me to be the person who caused you to be received with no respect?—<HI>A.</HI> I cannot say.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Admiral Buckner, please to recollect, whether I did not come on the quarter-deck, seeing you was re∣ceived without respect, and informed you, (after ask∣ing the ship's company why they could be so disgrace∣ful as not to cheer their Admiral on coming on board) that it originated entirely in a mistake, but if you would excuse it, and receive it now, the crew would give you three cheers?—<HI>A.</HI> You did come to me and say, that no disrespect was intended me; some at∣tempts, I believe, were made to man the ship, and you did say, that if I would receive it then, the people would man the yards; some attempts were made for that purpose, but by very few, the yard-ropes were hanging then.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Does Admiral Buckner recollect that on going on shore he was attended by the boats of the Sandwich, and some other boats of the fleet, seeing no flag flying?<HI>A.</HI> When I was going on shore I did not know that my flag was struck: several boats attended me.</P>
<P>The Court advised the Prisoner to invalidate, if he could, by any question, that part of the narrative of Admiral Buckner which stated, that he had released two marines, and told the Admiral that all his authority on board was at an end, that he had no authority, and that the power was in their hands.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="032837_0007_0FF51ABC3531BCA0"/>
The Prisoner put no question to this effect.</P>

<HEAD>The Admiral re-examined by the Court.</HEAD>
<P>Q. When the Prisoner treated you with apparent respect and modesty, was it privately, or publicly be∣fore the ship's company?—<HI>A.</HI> I never had any private conversation with him, and never saw him excepting once before the ship's company. When I saw him it was generally in a parade with a number of men from different ships, calling themselves Delegates.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When the Prisoner came to you to apologize for the want of respect on the part of the people on board, did he appear to influence or command the people?—<HI>A.</HI> I conceive by his coming to me to make the apology, he must have had some command in the ship. I had no opportunity of making that observation, as immediately after, he left the quarter-deck, and I did not see him again till he came with the paper be∣fore mentioned.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> On returning to the Sandwich on the morning of the 12th of May, after reporting the mutiny that existed, do you remember acquainting me that the people had given charge of the ship to Mr. Bray, the Master?—<HI>A.</HI> I think I do.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You must recollect it? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, I do.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you remember order being given to the Mas∣ter, from the Committee, or a set of men who had usurped that power, that no officers should interfere with any duty of the ship, but the Master? <HI>A.</HI> I heard of it as soon as I came on board; I did not hear it myself.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="032837_0010_0FF554E29E833FB0"/>
to attend the punishment of one of the seamen on board the Sandwich, whose name was Cammell.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> By whom was you ordered to attend? <HI>A.</HI> By Mr. Bray, the Master, who said it was the Commit∣tee's order, that I should attend the punishment: I went on deck, the Prisoner was standing on the gang∣way; as soon as the said Cammell was tied up, the Prisoner made a speech to the ship's company, ac∣quainting them with the offence, which was drunk∣eness, and informed them, that if they violated the laws laid down by the Committee, they would share the same fate.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What do you mean by the Committee? <HI>A.</HI> By the Committee, I understand the members from the different ships, calling themselves Delegates.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was the Prisoner one of them? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, Two or three days after the above circumstance, one of the ship's corporals of the Sandwich, whose name I believe is Wilson, came to me with orders from the Committee, that I should go between decks, as there was a man in irons who was very ill with a fever. I went, and saw the person that was then in irons, and I immediately desired the said ship's corporal to go to the Committee, and say that it was absolutely necessa∣ry for the prisoner to be taken out of irons, and re∣moved into the sick birth. He returned with an an∣swer, that it was the Committee's order that I should make the report in person. I accordingly went to the starboard bay, on the lower deck, and there found a vast crowd of people assembled. I asked whom I was to address? The Prisoner, Parker, desired me to ad∣dress him. I told him it was necessary to remove the sick man, who was in irons: he said, <Q>It is not our intention to interfere with you at all; you may do with the sick whatever you think proper.</Q> When I was leaving what they called the Committee-room, one of the people, whom I supposed to be a Delegate, said "Take off your hat, Sir." Then I turned round to see if I could recognize any of the Sandwich's peo∣ple; and some one said, "Be gone." It was not the prisoner, however.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="032837_0011_0FF554E42C634418"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> Who was he under confinement by? <HI>A.</HI> I know he was not under confinement by the Officers of the ship.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Had you ever received an answer from Parker with respect to the sick? <HI>A.</HI> I generally received a similar answer from Parker, "Do as you please with the sick." I sent to the Committee for permission to go on shore.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> By whom? <HI>A.</HI> By Davis, who was then a com∣manding Officer in the ship, (as I understood) upon the quarter-deck. I was ordered by Davis to attend the Com∣mittee, and I then asked their permission to go on shore, as I had found some sick on board, that wanted to go into the Hospital. The Prisoner, Parker, recom∣mended to the Committee to allow me to go, on con∣dition I should return the next morning; and I told them, I would use my influence with Admiral Buck∣ner, with respect to the sick. I went ashore, and never returned, till the ship was under the command of the regular officers. One day, some time in May, during the mutiny, when Capt. Moss was speaking to the Prisoner on deck, and remonstrating with him on the many improprieties which the men, then in a state of mutiny, were committing, the prisoner said, that "till their grievances were redressed, they would not one of them shrink," or words to that effect, if they did, he was certain they would be run up there, point∣ing to the yard arm, where the ropes were reeved.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In all your visits to those people, did you under∣stand that he was the leading man? <HI>A.</HI> I understood him to be the President of them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You found the Prisoner haranguing; did he seem to direct the proceedings? <HI>A.</HI> Parker ordered the Boatswain's Mate to do his duty, and give twelve lashes.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did Parker order the punishment and the num∣ber of lashes? <HI>A.</HI> Yes, he did.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In what capacity does the witness mean to say that Davis acted? <HI>A.</HI> I understood that Davis offi∣ciated as Captain of the ship.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="032837_0012_0FF554E6A387FE38"/>
Q. When did these facts take place? A. The pun∣ishment was on the 14th of May.</P>
<P>Q. When you understood Davis acted is Captain, how did you understand the prisoner to act? A. As President of the Committee, and it was generally so understood.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect where the Prisoner was sitting, when you went into the Committee-room, and what station he seemed to hold? A. He was sitting at the head of the table, and acted as President.</P>
<P>Q. Did he not act as leading man and President on all occasions? A. Yes, he did, when I saw him.</P>
<P>Q. Do you remember the day when the Admiral's flag was hauled down? A. I do not immediately re∣collect the day of the month, but I recollect being on deck, and that it was not up; I did not see it hauled down, but I saw the red flag in its place. When I saw the red flag flying, it struck me as the most daring outrage I had ever seen in the course of my life.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Prisoner, at the time, give orders to as∣semble the people on deck? A. I understood it was by his orders they attended the punishment alluded to; but I never heard him give such orders.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know who took the author by out of Mr. Bray, the master's hands? A. I was not on board then.</P>
<P>Q. By whose orders was Cammell, the sick person, confined, and for what offence? A. By the Mutineers assembled, calling themselves the Committee.</P>
<P>Q. For what offence? A. For drunkeness.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Prisoner at the bar, at the time Captain Moss remonstrated with him, stand with his hat off? A. His hat was on.</P>

Q.

<P>Q. Do you know the Prisoner? A. I have seen him before, several time.</P>
<P>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with him? A. No, I never had any conversation with him myself.</P>
<P>Q. Was he ever on board the Iris, to your knowl∣edge? A. No, not to my knowledge: I have been present at conversations between him and Admiral Buckner, and Commissioner Hartwell, at Sheerness.</P>
<P>There was a band of music playing, and they parad∣ed through the town of Sheerness, with a red flag, he and another man that I know, were generally foremost: I have seen him parading with the red flag, both in a boat and on shore. At one of the conversations at Commissioner Hartwell's house, as near as I can re∣collect, the Prisoner said, he envied no officer his com∣mand, as he experienced many difficulties and troubles in the situation in which he was placed. He was at that time, apparently modest and respectful. The last time he was ashore, I saw him land with two other Delegates, one from the Nassau, the other from the Standard, a paper was given to Commissioner Hart∣well, in the name of the Delegates of the North Sea Fleet, as containing their demands; on reading it, the Commissioner told the Prisoner, he was sorry it con∣tained so much matter, as he could not think of going to London with it, but had they confined themselves to the articles they had shewn him before, he would have gone to the Admiralty with them, and that if they were determined to insist on those last Articles, it would be unnecessary for him to take any farther trouble in the

<P>Q. Do you know the Prisoner, and have you heard the charge against him?—A. I have heard that the Prisoner belongs to the Sandwich, and I have heard the charge.</P>
<P>Q. Relate what you know of the charge?—<HI>A.</HI> I remember well, on or about the 20th of May, that Admiral Buckner flag was hoisted in the bow of the boat; he was in full uniform, and I accompanied him to the ships at the Great Nore, in order to intimate his Majesty's most gracious pardon to the crews of the several vessels under his command. In going on board the Sandwich, he was received without any respect due to his rank as a Flag Officer. Instead of accepting the pardon, the Prisoner held in his hand several new propositions to be redressed, under the head of <HI>Griev∣ances,</HI> The Admiral was detained upwards of three hours on board, in consequence of the ship's compa∣nies

not coming to a determination respecting the prop∣ositions, at the end of which time, they were present∣ed by the Prisoner to Admiral Buckner, in his cabin. The Admiral returned on shore, and was suffered to de∣part without the respect due to his rank, the man-ropes were on the yards, and the yard-ropes reeved, and the Admiral treated with much disrespect, for which the Officers appeared extremely concerned, not having it in their power to treat their Admiral with the proper and usual respect. I considered, therefore, the crew to be in a high state of mutiny; several days after, I was at Commissioner Hartwell's house, the Admiral was there, it was reported to him, that two marines had been brought to the guard-house for examination, by the military. As I then stood at the fore-door, I saw the Prisoner, who asked me, if the Commissioner could be spoken with; my answer was, I believed he was to be spoken with. The Prisoner came in, accompa∣nied by one Davis, and demanded to know the reason why the soldiers had brought the marines there. The Admiral asked him what right he had to make such a demand; the Prisoner said, "I am not to be intimidat∣ed—your flag is struck, you have no authority here. <HI>I or We,</HI> (I do not recollect positively which) command the fleet." Parker immediately took out a paper, and put questions to the marines; to one in particular. He was suffered to interrogate them and carry them away. During this last interview with Admiral Buckner, the Prisoner behaved with the most daring insolence and contempt. I have frequently seen the Prisoner head a body of men, whom they call Delegates of the fleet, and pass and repass Commissioner Hartwell's house, with a red flag displayed in their procession.</P>

<P>Q. Do you recollect when you went with Admi∣ral Buckner, any conversation between him and the Prisoner, at the time you formerly mentioned?—A.

<P>Q. Did you hear the charge read? A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. Yes, perfectly.</P>
<P>Q. Did he belong to the Sandwich, and in what station was he? A. He was a supernumerary on board the Sandwich.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know how long he belonged to the Sand∣wich? A. I cannot say how long he had been on board the Sandwich, he was on board the Hound, in April last, and was sent from the Hound to the Ten∣der, on the 11th of April.</P>
<P>Q. Was he sent from the Tender to the Sandwich?</P>
<P>A. I do not know.</P>
<P>Q. Relate to the court what you know of the Pris∣oner, of any improper expressions to any of the offi∣cers, and of the mutiny about the 12th of May? A. I saw nothing of the Prisoner at the time of the mutiny, until the 2d of June, on which day he came on board the Hound, on her arrival at the Nore; he then told me, that be had the honor of representing the whole fleet, an honor, he should never forget, that he understood that I had been very violent with some of the Delegates, and he advised me not to be so violent, for if I was, I must take the consequence. He then told me, that he did not like the ship's company, and that he knew they were attached to me; for which reason, he should put the ship in a safe birth where she could not make her escape. He ordered the pilot to get the ship under weigh, and to carry her as close to the Sandwich as possible; the pilot told him, it was an improper time of tide: the prisoner told the pilot, that if he did not choose to get her under weigh immediately, he would find means of making him, and at the same time he pointed to the yard-ropes. The Pilot got her under weight, and brought her close to the Sandwich, and the Prisoner ordered the anchor to be let go. We were then hailed from the Sandwich, saying, we were too near them; the Prisoner replied, I think we are, Mr. Davis. He immediately turned to the pilot with
<PB N="19" REF="032837_0018_0FF554F32C33F6B8"/>
threatening language, and did to him, you have com∣mitted one mistake, take care you do not commit another, if you do, I will make a beef-steak of you, at the yard-arm. The Prisoner ordered the pilot to get her under weigh again, and to moor her between the Sandwich and the Inflexible; she was got under weigh, and came round to the Sandwich's quarter; then the prisoner had the hands turned up and harangued them, but what passed, I cannot exactly say. One thing I heard him say was, that he found they were not hear∣ty in the cause, and that he should be obliged to replace them with other people. He asked them if they had any complaints against their officers, if they had, those that they disliked, were to be turned on shore, and those that they liked were to be kept on board. He said a vast deal to the people: after this, he ordered me out of the ship.</P>

<P>Q. Did he say by that name? A. Yes, he said by President Parker's orders, (the Prisoner.) The man told me, I was a dangerous character, and I ought to be lashed on board the Inflexible, or on board the Montague. I saw them often, they were frequently rowing about with the red flag in the boat, and the Prisoner haranguing them. I think they had a band of music, I saw him address the ship's people, but did not hear him, and they cheered him as he passed. There was a man put in irons, and I was told, it was by the order of the Prisoner: I saw the Prisoner go forward and speak to him, and threaten him. I wrote two letters while I was on board, one on the Admiral∣ty service, and the other a private one; the Prisoner brought them back to me, they would not be allowed to go on short, without being opened: I took my private letter, and told him he might open the other. He asked me who they were for, I told him; he said, there could be no communication on shore. One of the men standing by, desired him not to open it, he re∣plied
<PB N="20" REF="032837_0019_0FF554FBA57952A0"/>

<P>Q. When the Prisoner advised you not be violent to the Delegates, do you conceive that that advice was to prevent any mischief that might follow, or to deter you from doing your duty? A. The Prisoner told me, that he advised me as a friend, as he understood I had driven some of the Delegates out of the ship by threatening to put them to death: at that time I had some conversation with him, I asked him why he wish∣ed to send people on board, to force the ship's crew in∣to the business, and I told him, that my people was willing and wished to have nothing to do with it, as they had made no complaints. He told me that it was for the good of the whole, and they must have to do with it.</P>

I replied, I had no order from Admiral Buckner, to receive th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and that having now no command, my receipt was of no use; the only answer I had from him was, "we are answerable for what we do."

Monday, or Tuesday, about the 14th of June, the Prisoner came down from the deck and released me, and told me, I might walk on deck, but must have no conversation with the people. The Prisoner sent to Mr. Mott, on the same day, I think it was Tuesday. who came on the quarter-deck; I do not know what passed, but they called all hands by the prisoner's order; he told Mr. Mott to go on shore, and bring his Ma∣jesty's pardon, he asked the people if they were willing that Mr. Mott should go, the answer by the people was, they were willing, and wished that the ship might be given up to the officers.

Mr. Mott and myself called out, "haul down the blue co∣lors, and hoist the white," several of the people attended.</P>
<P>The Prisoner then made answer and said to me, that if we hauled down the blue, and hoisted the white, or changed the colors, there were three ships that would fire upon us.

Lieutenant Mott went to the shore, and brought the King's proclamation: then the Pris∣oner ordered all hands up, and it was read upon the quarter deck, by William Clark, deputy-purser. The Prisoner then spoke to the people and asked them, whether they were willing to accept of His Majesty's pardon, or to let her remain with us, as the Prisoner termed it, (meaning themselves) the people all answer∣ed, to the Officers, excepting two of the prisoners, now in custody, (Thomas Jones, and one Davis) who then said, the ships a-stern would fire on us: the Prisoner also said, if we changed our colors, the ships a-stern would fire on us.</P>

<P>I gave orders to get ready for unmooring the ship, as soon as the arms were secured by the Steward. The Prisoner came to me and said, "that if we offered to unmoor, the ships astern would fire on us."

<P>Q. Do you recollect my begging the ship's compa∣ny to deliver up the ship to their Officers, and trust to his Majesty's clemency? A. I do not recollect your beg∣ging them, but you asked them if they were willing.</P>
<P>Q. When the white colors were hoisted, did you hear me say it was the happiest moment I had felt for a long time? A. There might be such words pass, I do not recollect exactly, there was too much noise.</P>

<P>Q. You mean to qualify it, that it might be said, but nevertheless, you did not hear it? A. I do not recollect it, the noise and confusion prevented it.</P>

<P>Q. When the fore-top sail was loosed, did I not, in the most respectful manner, come on the quarter
<PB N="27" REF="032837_0026_0FF55510A75C6698"/>
deck to you, and point out to you that the crews of the Inflexible, and two more line of battle ships astern, would, I was afraid, from their violent tempers, get springs on their respective ships, so as to rake the Sand∣wich at every shot. A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Do you not remember that I did not dictate, but begged to be excused, except in that one instance, mentioning that it would be better if the Sandwich might not be got under weigh for her own safety, till she was less observed by the ships before mentioned? A. I have answered that question before: the Pris∣oners did say, that the ships astern would fire upon us.</P>

<P>Q. The Prisoner wishes to ask, if his man∣ners were not respectful on that occasion? A. Yes, they were fully respectful, he made the request in a re∣spectful manner, and offered that advice.</P>

<P>Q. Did you hear the charge, and do you know the Prisoner? A. Yes, I heard the charge and I know the Prisoner.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Prisoner belong to the Sandwich? A. I only know that he came from her, and they hailed him and we answered: I never saw the books, I sup∣pose he did.</P>
<P>Q. Do you remember seeing the Prisoner go on board the Director the day the Repulse got aground, in attempting to get into Sheerness harbour? A. I do.</P>
<P>Q. Relate to the Court his proceedings, from his going on board to the time of his departure? A. When the Prisoner came on board, he came aft on the quarter deck, and requested a boat to go with a flag of truce on board the Repulse, then he ordered all hands to be called, the boat was denied: he then wanted to slip the ship's cable, to go along side of the Repulse, that was denied. He upon this ordered a spring to be got on the cable, to bring her broadside to bear upon the Repulse; when the spring was on, he ordered it to be hove in, and to bear away the best bower: as the ship came round, he ordered them to point their guns
<PB N="28" REF="032837_0027_0FF55516E5050530"/>
at the Repulse, there was a gun fired from the Repulse to the best of my recollection, from the quarter-deck: then the Prisoner gave orders to fire at the Repulse from all the decks, as she had fired at us, which order was repeated by one of the Delegates of our ship, and was complied with. The Prisoner went to the gang way, and I did not see any more of him. The Re∣pulse was than on shore.</P>

<P>Q. Did you see any other ship with a spring on her cable at the same time, firing at the Repulse? A. I saw the Monmouth firing at the same time, but I could not discern the spring.</P>
<P>Q. Riding, as the ships were, at that time, could the broad side of any ship be brought to bear, in your opin∣ion, without a spring? A. From the situation in which the ships lay, they could not be brought to bear without a spring.</P>
<P>Q. Who had the command of the Director at the time the Prisoner came on board? A. Joseph Mitch∣ell, captain of the forecastle.</P>
<P>Q. Was it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that the Prisoner applied to slip the cables, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the advice of the ship's company? A. He was called for, but I did not see him at that time.</P>
<P>Q. During the time the Prisoner was on board, did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ever touch or point a gun. A. No. I never saw him touch a gun. I saw no body but the Prisoner come along the gang-way, on the starboard side.</P>
<P>Q. Do you mean that was the first time you saw him? A. When I saw him on the gang-way alone, it was the first time for that day, but I had seen him before.</P>
<P>Q. Did he give orders to fire aloud? A. Not very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Q. I do not mean with a speaking trumpet, but did he give orders, as an officer, in his duty would do? A. He spoke louder than I do now—FIRE, which was repeated.</P>
<P>Q. Did he give orders loud enough to be heard from
<PB N="29" REF="032837_0028_0FF5551871AAB8C0"/>

<P>Q. Who ordered them to cease firing? A. I do not know, I was then on the poop, I did not see the Prisoner.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Prisoner remain on board the Director, till the fire ceased? A. I do not know.</P>
<P>Q. Who appointed Joseph Mitchell, the boatswain, to the command of the ship? The Committee of the Delegates belonging to the Director.</P>
<P>Q. Had the Prisoner any command on board before that time? A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. In the situation in which the Repulse lay a∣ground, could she have brought any of her guns to bear on the Director?—A. To the best of my knowledge she could not, except her stern chases.</P>
<P>Q. From what part of the Repulse was the gun fir∣ed? A. From the larboard-side of the quarter-deck.</P>
<P>Q. You say they fired a gun from the larboard-side, what was the position of the Repulse? A. I could see nothing but her stern chases.</P>
<P>Q. What was the position of the Repulse, with re∣spect to the Director? A. To the best of my knowl∣edge, her bow was a little to the Southward.</P>
<P>Q. Did you see either side? A. I saw the larboard side, she was almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d on.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Prisoner order the guns of the Director to be pointed at the Repulse, before the gun was fired from that ship, or after? A. Before the gun was fired.</P>
<P>Q. Whom did the Prisoner ask for the boat, and who denied it? A. Joseph Mitchell was called aft, but I did not see him.</P>
<P>Q. How did you know the boat was denied him? A. By a general voice on the quarter deck; a cry of "No." In the same manner the request for slipping her cables was refused.</P>
<P>Q. Was the order for slipping the cables, refused by a general voice of the people? A. Yes, the an∣swer was "No."</P>

<P>Q. Where was you at the time the boat was refused me? A. I was on the fore-part of the poop.</P>
<P>Q. Had there been a gun fired at that time from the Director? A. Not to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect my addressing the ship's com∣pany of the Director, pointing out to them, what a dreadful thing it was for one brother to be firing on a∣nother, and that if they would allow me the boat, I would take a flag of truce in it, and repair to the Re∣pulse, which I did not doubt would stop the effusion of blood: What might happen to himself, I should not consider of any consequence, even if I lost my own life, to save so many men? A, Yes, I do re∣collect, that when you asked for a flag of truce to re∣pair to the Repulse, I heard you repeat those words, to save innocent blood from being spilt, (to the best of my recollection) and what might happen to himself, he should not consider of any consequence, even if he lost his life. I remember that, but I do not recollect I heard him say, that he would take a flag of truce and repair to the Repulse.</P>

<P>Q. It appears that the firing commenced be∣fore he made his application: in the first part of his evi∣dence he says, the Prisoner had asked for a boat, and after that, he gave orders for firing, upon the boat being refused. The Prisoner puts his question to the evidence, as if he was to go before the firing.</P>
<P>Q. Was it before the Prisoner gave orders to fire, or after, that this conversation took place? A. Before he gave orders to fire.</P>

<P>Q. Relate to the court such particulars as you saw relative to his conduct at that time on board the Monmouth? A. I did not see him when he came on board, I saw him first on the forecastle; when he came there, he took all the command of the Mon∣mouth's forecastle guns, the one gun which I attended, was fired six or seven times at the Repulse. When the gun was going to be loaded the seventh time, I told him not to put the cartridge in at that time, and I got a worm and wormed the gun out, then he immedi∣ately after that ordered the gun to be spunged, and loaded; after she was loaded, he was not content with a nine pound shot that was in her, but took a crow-bar and put the thick end in first: I immediately took it out of his hand, and he gave me a shove on the breast, which caused me to fall over the heel of the spare fore top-mast, after that, I was kept chock forward on the forecastle, by one Vance, a quarter master, who acted as captain of the ship; after being there an hour and an half, I was ordered to go down and stay in my birth. I did not stay down in my birth, but came on deck: when I came on deck, the Prisoner was stand∣ing on the heel of the spare top-mast, he ordered Vance to get our stream cable and bend it to our stream anchor. Vance made him answer, that he could not do that. Then the Prisoner said d—n it, slip your cable and go along side of the Repulse, and send her to hell, where she belongs to and shew them no quarters at all. After that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said to Vance, he could stay no longer on board the Monmouth, he would likewise go on board another ship, of the fleet, the Leopard, and send her to hell also, after the Repulse.</P>
<P>Q. Were the guns in general on the larboard side of the Monmouth, fired on the Repulse? A. Yes, they were continually kept firing.</P>
<P>Q. Had the Monmouth, previous to your firing at the Repulse, laid out a small anchor and hawser, or a spring on her cable? A. Yes, we got a small hawser out abaft, and took it to the best bower buoy.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="032837_0034_0FF5552BF617C358"/>

<P>Q. Do you know by whose order the hawser was carried out, and the jib and stay-sail hoisted? A. Yes, by Vance, the quarter master, who commanded.</P>
<P>Q. Did you see any other marks of activity in the Prisoner while he remained on board? A. No, none at all. I know of nothing else.</P>
<P>Q. During the time the Monmouth kept up a fire on the Repulse, did you see him point, or fire any gun? A. Yes, I did, the aftermost gun, on the forecastle, on the starboard side.</P>

I saw a great many people assembled on the forecastle, I went up to see what was the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, I saw the Prisoner standing abaft the foremost on some thing, above the deck, he was going to make a speech. Captain Vance, who was acting as Captain then, of our ship, wanted to speak first, the Prisoner would not allow it, he would insist on the ship's slipping her cable, there were no other cables bent at the time: the ship's company would not agree to it; he said, he would go on board one of the outside ships, and make her slip her cable, and go along side of the Leopard, and send her to Hell, where she ought to go. During the time of this speech, the Repulse got off the ground: the Prisoner dismounted himself from the place where he was on, shook his fist, swore, and said, d—n me, she is off. He directly called the boat's crew from on board the Sandwich, in which boat he went himself. That is all I have to say.</P>

<P>Q. Was there a hawser carried out from the Mon∣mouth, to bring her broadside to bear on the Repulse? A. There was one brought along side, by another ship's boat, that was made fast, and the ship brought to bear on the Repulse.</P>
<P>Q. What was the hawser made fast to? A. The hawser was made fast to the best bower-cable: having broke a small cord or tow-line, they veered away the

<HEAD>PRISONER'S DEFENCE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As I have been at sea from my youth, I therefore hope nothing will be expected from me but a narrative of plain facts. I cannot dress up my defence in the pompous language of a lawyer; could I have procured assistance, I might have been enabled to have expressed myself with more propriety.</P>
<P>In the first place, I have to return thanks to this Court for giving me the time they have, to defend my∣self against the very heavy charges brought against me. Nothing but the consciousness of the integrity of my in∣tentions with respect to the mutiny, and the reflection that I did not enter into it until two days after it com∣menced, could have supported me against such heavy charges, sworn to by so many witnesses, and a firm con∣viction that I entered into it solely with the view of repressing the dangerous spirit I saw predominant in the fleet. The first witness called against me was Vice-Admiral Buckner, who says he often saw me, and he acknowledges my behavior to him was always respectful. I never waited on Admiral Buckner with∣out the express orders of the Delegates; and when I did, studiously avoided sporting with his feelings, by improper behavior; on the contrary, I couched eve∣ry message I had to deliver in the most respectful terms I was able. It may be asked how I came to be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> person pitched upon to deliver such messages, and act as the principal in the business. To this I can only answer, that such was the case. The Delegates insist∣ed on my assuming the situation I appeared in, and it
<PB N="40" REF="032837_0039_0FF51ACE1FA96090"/>
was impossible for me, or any individual under similar circumstances, to have resisted such an appointment. I know nothing of the mutiny till it had broke out. As soon as I saw that fatal spirit of the mutiny which prevailed, I immediately thought it my duty, and I en∣deavored, as far as in me lay, to stop the further progress of it. However melancholy have been the events which have taken place, I am convinced more dreadful consequences would have ensued, had I not acted the part I have done—consequences, which I hesitate not in saying, I have prevented, at the hazard of my life; and feeling that I have done whatever was in my power to lessen the evil, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could not wholly prevent, I can wait the decision of the Court with calmness and resignation. Admiral Buckner represents, that on or about the 20th of May, he was not received with that respect which was due to his rank. I was sorry that it should have been so, but that he cannot bring home to me, as he was on board before me, and I was at the time on shore, attending a procession; and the Admiral himself acknowledges, that when I did go on board I went on the quarter-deck and said, it must have been owing to some mistake, he was not received with the honors due to him; and I offered that the men should man the yards, if he would receive the cheers He acknowledges an attempt was made to man the yards, which afterwards subsided. It was so, an attempt was made <HI>by me</HI> to that effect, though at that time it was a thing dangerous to pro∣pose, and done at the risk of my life, for it was signi∣fied, if it was complied with, that the Inflexible and the other ships, would fire upon and sink the Sandwich; a report having been propagated that Admiral Buckner was not a fit person to reconcile the fleet with the Ad∣miralty, which so discomposed our people, that the re∣spect intended to be shewn was defeated. Capt. Moss sent Mr. Bray on board the Inflexible, where he said he found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompions out of the guns, the matches ready, and every appearance of hostility. During the whole continuance of the mutiny, there were daily meetings of the Committee of the Delegates of the
<PB N="41" REF="032837_0040_0FF5554071DE1530"/>
ships. The Delegates received propositions, for all measures originated on board the Inflexible; and there is not a man of the whole fleet, who does not attribute the melancholy consequences that took place, to the violence of the people of the Inflexible. It was to pre∣vent those consequences, I went on shore to Admiral Buckner, and when I was half passage to shore, I first observed the Admiral's flag down, and the red one in its stead. In answer to what Admiral Buckner has said respecting the two marines, I do not deny being commanded by the Delegates of the fleet to act as I did. The circumstances were these: The people call∣ed Delegates, representing the ship's company were re∣freshing themselves with their usual allowance, which was a pint of beer to each man. In the mean time they were informed, that two marines were in custody, of the main-guard, for approving of the conduct of the seamen. The Delegates desired me to inquire if it was so. I did. The Officer said he had no such per∣sons in custody. We were informed, that the two marines were at Commissioner Hartwell's house. We accordingly went and told him to release the men, and send them on board, where their conduct should be in∣quired into, and the men punished if they deserved it. We saw Admiral Buckner, who said the marines had used very improper language at a house at Queen∣borough, but as we were sent by the Delegates, he had no objection to our examining them. One of them appeared in a state of intoxication. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, and Admiral Buckner said, Parker, you are ask∣ing very proper questions. The men were taken and sent to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke fleet, and the next day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> aboard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> re∣spective ships. It was requested by the Admiral they should be confined, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with. I shall not observe further relative to my con∣duct on account of the mariners, but I beg leave to state this question to the Court, whether four men, un∣armed, could have taken them away from a strong guard, and in the face of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, unless with the approbation of the Commissioner and Admiral. I re∣peat, that I never did behave with any, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, dis∣respect
<PB N="42" REF="032837_0041_0FF55542014C7560"/>
towards Admiral Buckner: I remember a con∣versation, wherein Admiral Buckner said, consuler what must have been my feelings at seeing my flag struck. I replied, I had nothing to do with striking your flag. I told him I could judge what his feelings must have been on such an occasion; that I had feel∣ings of my own, and could easily participate in his, but that I could not prevent them, as I was but a sin∣gle individual among many. Having done with Admi∣ral Buckner's evidence, I think it but justice to ac∣knowledge, that both Admiral Buckner, and Commis∣sioner Hartwell, did every thing that lay in their power to satisfy the minds of the fleet. The next evidence was Lieutenant Justice, he says, he knows nothing of me. The third was Captain O'Bryen, who says, he knows nothing to the disadvantage of me. Captain Fancourt said, he never saw me before. Captain Cobb, deposed to the same effect; as did Captain Parr, and Captain Hargood likewise.</P>
<P>Mr. John Snipe deposes, that on the afternoon of the 14th of May, he was called on to attend the punishment of a man of the name of Cammell, and that I ordered him a dozen lashes. I do not attempt to deny that I did act as he has sworn. I was commanded to see the punishment inflicted, but Mr. Bray was consulted as to the propriety of inflicting such a punishment for the offence he had commited, which was for getting beast∣ly drunk, at the same time asserting he had drank noth∣ing but small beer. I recommended to the whole ship's crew to abstain from liquor until the whole of the business was settled, telling them, if they did not, that the punishment which their justice had inflicted on that man, should be inflicted on any one offending. As to the sick man in irons, it was a man confined for disrespect to Captain Moss; the answer given by me, on that occasion, to Mr. Snipe, sufficiently shews, that I did not mean to interfere with his professional con∣cerns; and I hope it will have the effect of shewing to the Court, that I was alive to the sufferings of my fellow-creatures. Mr. Snipe has said, that he had leave to go on shore, on his promising to return again
<PB N="43" REF="032837_0042_0FF555438CBAAAC0"/>
the next morning, but that he took care not to re∣turn, till the ship was under the command of its offi∣cers. I shall make no comment on this part of his evidence, but I shall only ask, whether it was praise worthy on his part, at a time when the seamen were laboring under incurable disorders, for a surgeon to leave the ship, merely because his situation was not so comfortable as he could have wished.</P>
<P>I next come to the evidence of Capt. Surridge, of the Iris; he says, that he has seen me once at the Commissioner's house, and that he afterwards saw me come up to the Commissioners, where he recollects my delivering to him the articles containing the final de∣termination of the North Sea squadron. I do declare, that I had no conversation with the Commissioners, but left it entirely to them to satisfy themselves, that the articles I had presented, really did contain the demands of that fleet. Capt. Surridge has declared, that he saw no disrespect on my part towards him, therefore I shall not dwell further on his evidence, but answer it in the general conclusion.</P>
<P>The next evidence is Capt. Dixon, of the L'Espion, but as any observations in his evidence are answered by what I have observed with respect to Admiral Buckner, and Capt. Surridge, I shall decline commenting on it.</P>
<P>I now come to the evidence of Capt. John Wood, of the Hound, who has deposed, that I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt on board his ship, and advised him not to be so violent. I cer∣tainly did go on board, but I had no other motive than the personal safety of the Captain, and the preservation of the ship. He says he was ordered out of his ship, but he has never produced who ordered him out. In answer to this, I solemnly assert I did not know that he was ordered to leave his ship, the orders were not, certainly given by me, and though I have heard it in the Court, I never heard it in the ship. As to my having said I would make a beef-steak of the Pilot at the yard-arm, I solemnly declare I did not make use of such expressions. I do not recollect the Pilot's let∣ting go the anchor. I declare to God I know nothing of it. If I was before the face of God, I would deny
<PB N="44" REF="032837_0043_0FF555451861DA10"/>
it. As to the yard ropes, they were reeved before I was on board. It is very possible Capt. Wood might be mistaken, as to my being the person who gave the order.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Flatt deposes he does not know me. As I shall have occasion to ask Lieutenant Flatt some more questions, I shall not make any further observa∣tions on his evidence, till he has been examined again.</P>
<P>Mr. Levingston, boatswain of the Director, deposes, that he saw me on board the Director, at the time the Repulse was on shore, that I asked him for a boat, ob∣serving, that it might be the means of saving many lives. He recollects my giving the word fire. After which, Mr. Samuel Hilliard deposes, that he saw me on board the Director, that he heard me address the ship's company, and that soon after the guns were fir∣ed, but that he did not hear me order it. In the first place, in order to account for my being on board the Director—I only went on board to prevent the effusion of human blood. When the demands of the North Sea Fleet were known, a boat went round to the whole fleet, with a band of music, playing, God save the King, Rule Britannia, and Britons Strike Home; for which, were the ship journals produced, they would prove it was the command of the whole ship's com∣pany. I was desired to be on that duty. Matthew Hollister informed me on board the Sandwich, that the Repulse was getting under way, and that the Di∣rector was getting a spring on her cable. I was then commanded on board the Director. I saw the guns on the quarter deck cast loose. I pointed out the impropriety and cruelty of one brother fighting against another; and I begged for a flag of truce, which was refused. I then founded their dispositions, by propos∣ing to go along side the Repulse; this I did, in order to see how far they would proceed; and I was happy to find they did not approve of so doing. My reason for asking for a flag of truce was, I thought if I could obtain permission to take it, none of the other ships would fire on the Repulse, out of respect to the flag of truce they had granted, but finding myself opposed, I was obliged to act a part I abominated, and which,
<PB N="45" REF="032837_0044_0FF5554E200CC5E0"/>
to my grief, I saw before I came on board. I do not recollect giving orders to fire; but if I did, they must have been the orders of compulsion, and not choice.</P>
<P>Thomas Barry, seaman, deposed, I was on board the Monmouth; he must have been greatly mistaken in what he has related, but I will prove I was not at that time on board the Monmouth, that I was then on board the Director, and that he must have confused me with some other person. He deposed that I said FIRE, and that after the firing the sixth or seventh gun from the forecastle, that on the gun being loaded the seventh time, I was not content with a nine pound shot, but that I put a crowbar into the mouth of the gun. He relates some one being confined by a man called Capt. Vance. He also swore that when the Repulse got off, I shook my fist, and said, "D—n me, she's off, and that I swore I would take one of the outside ships, and send her to Hell, where she belonged to:" and on my asking him what had been promised to him for telling this hellish story, he answered, "nothing had been promised him." I do declare that I went on board the Sandwich in the Ardent's boat, and not in the manner described by Barry.</P>
<P>John Summerland does not recollect my working with my clothes off, but he says. I was on board the Monmouth. In fact, I was more in want of rest, than anxious to look after Don Quixotte adventures. I did go on board the Monmouth it is certain, but with the same views I had in going on board the Director. As to my having said I would take an out∣side ship and repair to the Leopard, I could have no other motive for so doing, than to make her keep her station. Some days previous to the Sandwich being delivered up, the Montague made a signal for a Dele∣gate, I thought they were by no means amicable, with respect to their dispositions in general, and therefore, the signal was not complied with.</P>
<P>I have now made all the remarks which occur to me on the evidence. I now address myself again to the Court, not for the purpose of intimating, that where mercy can be extended, it ought to be shewn, being
<PB N="46" REF="032837_0045_0FF555513AF56DF8"/>
assured that I shall have strict justice; but I appeal to them to attend particularly to the evidence of Barry. However I may have been misrepresented in the pub∣lic prints, my intentions were good. My character is dearer to me than a thousand lives. My country al∣lows me justice, and justice I trust I shall have from this honorable Court.</P>

<P>The Court having deliberated for <HI>two hours</HI> and <HI>a half,</HI> the Prisoner was called in; when the Judge Ad∣vocate read as follows:</P>
<P><Q>At a Court Martial, held on board his Majesty's ship, Neptune, of 98 guns, lying in the River Thames, on Thursday, the 22d day of June, 1797, and continu∣ed by adjournment till the 26th of the same month.</Q></P>
<P><HI>(The Names of the Members were recited.)</HI></P>
<P>The Court, pursuant to an order of the Commission∣ers for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral, hearing date the 19th of June, 1797, directed to Sir Thomas Paisley, Vice-Admiral, have proceeded to try Richard Parker, (he being a person belonging to his Majesty's fleet) on a charge for having made, and en∣deavored to make, a dangerous mutiny and mutinous assemblies on board his Majesty's ship, the Sandwich, and divers other ships and vessels, under the command of Vice Admiral Buckner, at the Nore: and also on a charge of having behaved with contempt to the offi∣cers
<PB N="58" REF="032837_0057_0FF5557698264FE0"/>
on duty, and having disobeyed his superior offi∣cers.</P>
<P>The Court having heard the witnesses on the part of the crown, in support of the charge, and what the pris∣oner has related in his defence, and the evidence in support of what he has alledged upon the same, the Court are unanimously of opinion, that the whole of the charge is fully proved, that the crimes are as unprece∣dented as they are wicked, and as ruinous to the navy as to the peace and prosperity of the country. The Court doth therefore adjudge him to suffer <HI>DEATH,</HI> and he is ordered to suffer death accordingly, at such time and place as the Lords Commissioners of the Ad∣miralty, or any three of them shall direct and appoint.</P>
<P><HI>Parker the Prisoner,</HI> with a degree of fortitude and undismayed composure, which excited the astonishment and admiration of every one present, spoke as follows:</P>
<P>"I bow to your sentence with all due submission, being convinced I have acted from the dictates of a good conscience. God Almighty, who knows the hearts of all men, will, I hope, receive me. I hope that my death alone will atone to the Country; and that those brave men, who have acted with me will receive a gen∣eral pardon; I am satisfied they will return to their duty with alacrity."</P>

<P>It is in the breast of the Court to order you for execution immediately, but we think it better to give you time to repent your crime.</P>

<P>I return you my thanks for the indulgence.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Court adjourned at half past four.</P>
<P>The pressure of the crowd to hear the defence of Parker, was immense.</P>
<P>The OATH which the Witnesses took, was as fol∣lows: "I swear by God, and as I shall answer to Almighty God, at the great Day of Judgment; that the evidence I shall give, shall be the Truth, the Whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, so help me God!"</P>

<HEAD>EXECUTION OF PARKER, <HI>The MUTINEER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FRIDAY morning, (<HI>June 30th,</HI> 1797) at 8 o'clock, A. M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gun was fired from on board his Majesty's ship L'Espion, ly∣ing off the garrison; Vice Admiral Lutwidge's flag ship, and the <HI>yellow flags:</HI> the signal of capital punishment, was hoisted, which was immediately repeated by the Sandwich's hoisting the same color on her foretop. The Sandwich was stationed rather above Black Stakes the headmost ship in the fleet. The garrison, on the gun firing, were immediately under arms, consisting of the East and West York, and West Norfolk militia; a corps of Invalids, and a train of Artillery; all of which, with fixed bayonets, marched out to Sally Port Gate, with their colors flying, and proceeded in single files, along the South shore of the Medway, near to Queenborough, in order to be spectators of the event—all the barrier gates of the garrison were now shut, and each ship in the fleet at this time, sent a boat off with a Lieutenant and a party of marines, to attend the Sandwich; and the crews of all were piped to the forecastle, and the marines drawn up on the quarter deck, to be witnesses of the ex∣ecution. The prisoner, who had taken his usual repast in the birth allotted him in the gun room, and passed the night in great com∣posure, was awaked a little after six o'clock, from a sound sleep, by the Marshal Provost, who with a file of marines composed his guard. He arose with cheerfulness, and requested permission might be asked for a barber to attend him, which was granted, he soon dressed himself in a neat suit of mourning (waistcoat excepted) sent him by a friend of the name of T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, wearing his half boots over a pair of black silk flocking: he then took his breakfast talk∣ed of a <HI>Will</HI> he had written, in which he had bequeathed to his wife a little estate he said he was heir to; and after that lamented the misfortune that had been brought on the country by the mutiny, <HI>but solemnly denied having the least connection, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> correspondence with any disaffected persons on shore, and declared that it was chiefly owing to him that the ships had not been carried into the enemy's ports!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="032837_0059_0FF5557B96A1E648"/>
At half past eight, he was told the Chaplain of the ship was rea∣dy to attend him to prayers upon the quarter deck, which he im∣mediately ascended uncovered. At his first entrance on the deck, he looked a little paler than common, but soon recovered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> complexion; he bowed to the officers, and a chair being allowed him he sat down a few moments, and steadily surveyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of marines under arms, round the deck; he then arose and told the clergyman he was ready to attend him; the chaplain in∣formed him he had selected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Psalms appropiate to his situation to which the Prisoner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, said; 'And with your permission, Sir, I will add a third,' and named the 51st that beautiful confes∣sional of David, and imploring of forgiveness, "Have mercy upon me O God, after thy great goodness according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences, &amp;c. He then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecited each alt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nate verse in a manner peculiarly impressive. At 9 o'clock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preparatory gun was fired from L'Espion, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ard with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the smallest emotion.—Prayers being soon after closed, he rose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> asked Captain Moss <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if he might be indulged with a glass of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wine? which being immediately granted, he took it, and lifting up his eyes exclaimed—"I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ink fir∣st to the salvation of my soul:—and next to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e forgiveness of all my enemies!"—Addressing him∣self to Captain Moss, he said "he hoped the would shake hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with him,"—which the Captain did; he then desired "that he might be remembered to his companion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on board the Neptune; with his last dying entreaty to them, to prepare for their destiny, and re∣frain from unbecoming levity!"—</P>
<P>The instant he was visible at the yard-arm, the Telegraph was put in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion to announce it to the Admiralty; and from the clearness of the atmosphere and quickness of working, the advice must have been received in seven minutes.</P>
<P>He suffered exactly at half past nine, and was lowered down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter hanging at the yard-arm a full hour, when the yellow-flag was struck, and his body instantly put into a shell that had been prepar∣ed for it, with all his clothes on; and soon after it was taken in one of the Sandwich's boats, and rowed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> point of the garrison, and there being landed, was carried to the new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>val <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣ing-ground, out of the Red Barrier gate, leading to Minster. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lid was here taken off to the spectators for a few minute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; his countenance a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much altered, but his eyes were wide open. His body was, however, afterwards taken up by his friends, and brought to London. It was on Sunday lying at a house in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, near the Tower.</P>
<P>Parker was about 33 years of age, five feet ten inches high, and well made, his complexion, eyes, and hair, dark; his nose promi∣nent and his countenance expressive and manly. He was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a bake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at Exeter, and had spent most of his life at sea.</P>
