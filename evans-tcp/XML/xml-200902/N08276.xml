At a Meeting of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> le∣gally assembled at <HI>Faneuil</HI>-Hall, on Wed∣nesday <DATE>the 28th of <HI>October,</HI> 1767.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE Town then took into Consideration the Petition of a Number of Inhabitants,
<Q>That some effectual Measures might be agreed upon to promote Industry, Oe∣conomy, and Manufactures; thereby to prevent the unnecessary Importation of Euro∣pean Commodities, which threaten the Country with Poverty and Ruin:</Q> Whereupon in a very large and full Meeting, the following Votes and Resolutions were passed Unanimously.</P>
<P><HI>Whereas the excessive Use of foreign Superfluities is the chief Cause of the present distressed State of this Town, as it is thereby drained of its Money; which Misfortune is likely to be increased by Means of the late additional Burthens and Impositions on the Trade of the Province, which threaten the Coun∣try with Poverty and Ruin:</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>VOTED,</HI> That this Town will take all prudent and legal Measures to encourage the Produce and Manufactures of this Province, and to lessen the Use of Superfluities, &amp; particularly the fol∣lowing enumerated Articles imported from Abroad, viz. <HI>Loaf Sugar, Cordage, Anchors, Coaches, Chaises and Carriages of all Sorts, Horse Furniture, Men and Womens Hatts, Mens and Womens Apparel ready made, Houshold Furniture, Gloves, Mens and Womens Shoes, Sole-Leather, Sheathing and Deck Nails, Gold and Silver and Thread Lace of all Sorts, Gold and Silver Buttons, Wrought Plate of all Sorts, Dia∣mond, Stone and Paste Ware, Snuff, Mustard, Clocks and Watches, Silversmiths and Jewellers Ware, Broad Cloths that cost above 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> per Yard, Muffs Furrs and Tippets, and all Sorts of Millenary Ware, Starch, Womens and Childrens Stays, Fire Engines, China Ware, Silk and Cotton Velvets, Gauze, Pew∣terers hollow Ware, Linseed Oyl, Glue, Lawns, Cam∣bricks, Silks of all Kinds for Garments, Malt Li∣quors and Cheese.</HI>—And that a Subscription for this End be and hereby is recommended to the se∣veral Inhabitants and Housholders of the Town; and that <HI>John Rowe,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>William Greenlease, Melatiah Bourne,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Samuel Austin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Payne,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edmund Quincy,</HI> Tertius, <HI>John Ruddock,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Jonathan Williams,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Joshua Henshaw,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Henderson Inches,</HI> Mr. <HI>Solomon Davis, Joshua Winslow</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Thomas Cushing,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> be a Committee to prepare a Form for Sub∣scription, to report the same as soon as possible; and also to procure Subscriptions to the same.</P>
<P><HI>And whereas it is the Opinion of this Town, that divers new Manufactures may be set up in</HI> Ame∣rica, <HI>to its great Advantage, and some others carried to a greater Extent, particularly those of Glass &amp; Paper</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>Voted,</HI> That this Town will by all prudent Ways and Means, encourage the Use and Consumption of Glass and Paper, made in any of the British American Colonies; and more especi∣ally in this Province.</P>
<P><HI>[Then the Meeting adjourn'd till</HI> 3 <HI>o'Clock Afternoon.]</HI></P>

<P>THE Committee appointed in the Forenoon, to prepare a Form for Subscription, reported as follows.</P>
<P><HI>WHEREAS this Province labours under a heavy Debt, incurred in the Course of the late War; and the Inhabitants by this Means must be for some Time subject to very burthensome Taxes: — And as our Trade has for some Years been on the decline, and is now particularly under great Em∣barrassments, and burthened with heavy Impositions, our Medium very scarce, and the Balance of Trade greatly against this Country:</HI></P>
<P>WE therefore the Subscribers, being sensible that it is absolutely necessary, in Order to extricate us out of these embarrassed and distressed Circumstan∣ces, to promote Industry, Oeconomy and Manu∣factures among ourselves, and by this Means pre∣vent the unnecessary Importation of European Com∣modities, the excessive Use of which threatens the Country with Poverty and Ruin—DO promise and engage, to and with each other, that we will en∣courage the Use and Consumption of all Articles manufactured in any of the British American Co∣lonies, and more especially in this Province; and that we will not, from and after the 31st of <HI>Decem∣ber</HI> next ensuing, purchase any of the following Articles, imported from Abroad, viz. <HI>Loaf Sugar,</HI> and all the other Articles enumerated above.—</P>
<P><HI>And we further agree strictly to adhere to the late Regulation respecting Funerals, and will not use any Gloves but what are Manufactured here, nor procure any new Garments upon such an Occa∣sion, but what shall be absolutely necessary.</HI></P>
<P>The above Report having been considered, the Question was put, Whether the same shall be ac∣cepted? <HI>Voted unanimously in the Affirmative.</HI>
—And that said Committee be desired to use their best Endeavours to get the Subscription Papers filled up as soon as may be. Also, <HI>Voted unani∣mously,</HI> That the foregoing Vote and Form of a Subscription relative to the enumerated Articles, be immediately Published; and that the Selectmen be directed to distribute a proper Number of them among the Freeholders of this Town; and to for∣ward a Copy of the same to the Select-Men of every Town in the Province; as also to the principal City or Town Officers of the chief Towns in the several Colonies on the Continent, as they may think proper.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Attest, William Cooper, <HI>Town-Clerk.</HI></SIGNED>

<P>Then the Meeting was Adjourn'd to the 20th Day of November next.</P>
