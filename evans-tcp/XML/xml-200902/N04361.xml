<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' Human Learning is not esteemed an essential Qualifi∣cation to a Minister of the Gos∣pel by the Society of which the Author of the ensuing small Treatise became a Member and Minister, yet inasmuch as it is esteemed so by some of other Christian Societies, the said Treatise may be better accepted of such, when they are acquainted that he was a Scholar, which to shew, please to observe, that <Q>He was one trained up to Lite∣rature,
<PB N="4" REF="005393_0003_101732DE76DEB508"/>and had studied diligently in the University, and tho' he was but young then, yet of pious Conversation, disliked many Ceremonies and Customs in the Schools. When he had finished his Course there, he was ordain'd a Priest of the Church of England, and a cer∣tain great Man took him to be his Chaplain; and afterwards he got a Living at <HI>Lydd,</HI> worth about <HI>two Hundred</HI> Pounds a Year. But after having been thus employ'd some time, he came to see that <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> was an human Institution, and to <HI>preach</HI> for Wages unlawful.—And becoming in time more and more uneasy to go on in Acting what was burthensom to his Conscience, he resolved to desist from his Ministry, and so he went to the Bishop and delivered up the Com∣mission that he had received from him to preach; and casting himself upon God's Providence, he took a Farm and turn'd Grasier, by which Means he maintained his Wife and Children
<PB N="5" REF="005393_0004_1017331414896A70"/>much better to his Content than be∣fore.

<P>To which may be added, a short Ex∣tract of <HI>WILLIAM PENN'S</HI> Testimony concerning him, <HI>i. e.</HI> <Q>I have myself found Information and Comfort in pe∣rusing several Tracts that have been written by him; and tho' I greatly valued his Abilities, employ'd so ac∣curately in a good Cause, yet above all, I cannot but admire and love his great <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Humility,</HI> who from being a Teacher, became willing to be taught; and that most eveness and sweetness of Temper, his most in∣timate Friends have often observed in him: So that he was not only a good Scribe but a good Liver; a Christian, according to the Apostle <HI>James,</HI> com∣posed of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works;</HI> therefore
<PB N="6" REF="005393_0005_101732E18EECB590"/>is his Name of good Savour with the the Righteous, because <HI>he counted no∣thing dear in comparison of the Ex∣cellency of the Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, which came not by Flesh and Blood, but by the Revelation of the Father of Lights.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>Sect. 1.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Testimony, and that Truth to which we bear Testimony, who by those to whom Woe is, forasmuch as they tremble not at the Word of God, are scornfully stiled <HI>Quakers,</HI> is no different Thing, nor another, but plainly one and altogether-the same, which all the Holy Men and Prophets of God have held forth, as also CHRIST himself and all his Apostles and Ministers, as many as have spoken as they were moved of God from the beginning of the World to this very Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. For even as they (whose Testi∣mony who even few or none either be∣lieved or received) so we, who are of her Children, of all and only whom Wisdom is justified, give Testimony to Wisdom itself, not the Wisdom of this World, nor of the Princes of this World,
<PB N="8" REF="005393_0007_101732E313803BB8"/>who come to nought, but to that hidden Wisdom, which none of the Princes of this World knew (for had they known, they would not crucify the Lord of Glory) The <HI>Wisdom of God</HI> is a Mystery, even the Light of the Lord God and JESUS CHRIST, who are Light, <HI>and in whom is no Darkness at all;</HI> yea to that glorious <HI>Light</HI> that is now arising to <HI>enlighten</HI> that Holy City <HI>New-Jerusalem,</HI> where now there is to be no more Night, into <HI>which nothing shall in any wise enter that defileth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Concerning which <HI>Light</HI> CHRIST himself said to <HI>Paul,</HI> being now truly Converted to it, which he persecuted be∣fore, through the blindness of his Mind, <HI>I now send thee to the Nations, to open their Eyes and turn them from Darkness to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are sanctified by Faith that is in me.</HI> Acts, 26.17, 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. Neither was this the Business and Ministry which <HI>Paul</HI> only receiv'd of God, that he might fulfil it; but <HI>John</HI> also testifies, that this was the Message
<PB N="9" REF="005393_0008_101733188CFEE780"/>which he, together with the rest of CHRIST'S Ministers, had received from CHRIST himself, to declare, which was also from the Beginning, not any new Thing, (however it might seem new, as being clouded till the Darkness was past, and the true Light shined again out of the Darkness that sometime clouded it) but the old Thing, which was from the Beginning, namely, <HI>That God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all, and that if we say we have Fellow∣ship with him, and walk in Darkness, we lye and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have mutual Fellowship with him, and the Blood of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>his Son, cleanseth us from all Sin,</HI> 1 John 1.5, 6, 7. Moreover, that <HI>who saith he is in the Light and hateth his Brother, is in Darkness even until now.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Concerning which <HI>Light of God,</HI> of which the Scripture every were speak∣eth, and from which enlightning the Penmen thereof, the Scripture itself was given forth, which also was, which also shined in the Heart of Man long before
<PB N="10" REF="005393_0009_101732E775DFDAD8"/>the Scriptures were; we, together with the Scripture and the Writers there∣of, do testify this self same Thing, namely, That a certain Measure, certain Beams were of old, and now are given of God, in the Conscience of every of them, to the Sons of Men, who altho' God made them after his own Image, upright and blameless, have yet sought out to themselves both various and vain Inventions, and corrupted their Ways and erred: And as to any help they can have from themselves, are in a Manner wholy perisned from the true God, and <HI>from the Knowledge of him, whom truly to know is Life eternal,</HI> and from all Communion with him, to shine in their dark Hearts as a Light in a Dark Place, and to bring them back through the Con∣demnation of their evil Deeds, Words, and Thoughts, and of that whole Chaos of Confusion and Corruption that came in by the Fall, which Con∣demnation this Light will bring on all that take good heed to it and through the Mortification of that old Man and Body, as well of Death as Sin, with
<PB N="11" REF="005393_0010_1017331D1F6DDE30"/>all its earthly Members; and in a Word, of all whatever in Man is contrary to the Image and Will of God, and turn them back unto God, unto that <HI>primitive State</HI> of <HI>Purity, Righteousness</HI> and <HI>In∣nocency,</HI> from which they departed to worship Images in their own Imagination, to know and to worship the true God, who is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> truly <HI>in Spirit and in Truth,</HI> with which Worship only the Lord is worshipped according to his Will; and lastly, to enjoy such spiri∣tual Peace and Communion with him, as none are by any Means possible (as is aforesaid) capable of, while they are alienated from him by the <HI>Darkness of Iniquity,</HI> and while they remain in their <HI>Transgression incorrigible</HI> and <HI>unconverted.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Rom. 3, 6, 9, 19. <HI>For both Jew and Gentiles</HI> (as it is written) <HI>are concluded all under Sin, there is not one Righteous, no not one; there is none that understand∣eth, there is none that seeketh after God, they are all gone out of the Way, they are altogether become unprofitable, there is none that doeth Good, no not one; their Throat is an open Sepulchre, with their Tongues
<PB N="12" REF="005393_0011_101732E900307258"/>they have uttered Deceit, the Poyson of Asps is under their Lips, their Mouth is full of Cursing and Bitterness, their Feet is swift to shed Blood, Wasting and Mise∣ry is in their Way, and the Way of Peace they have not known, there is no Fear of God before their Eyes. So that every Mouth is stopped and the whole World be∣come guilty before God, for all have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. This is the State of all Mankind se∣parated by the <HI>Fall</HI> from the <HI>Light</HI> into the <HI>Darkness,</HI> among whom even all of whatsoever Sex, Nation, Language, Condition or Age (at least that is capa∣ble to discern between Good and Evil) I say, all may say within themselves, We are lost, we are gone down head∣long into the utmost Darkness, into ex∣tream Damnation from God: Neither is there any other way to Life exhibited, but by JESUS CHRIST the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> by some Measure of <HI>Light</HI> at least shining from himself, <HI>enlightning</HI> (as it's said) <HI>every Man that comes into the World, shining in Darkness,</HI> in the dark Consciences of Men, <HI>though the
<PB N="13" REF="005393_0012_101733201C9327B0"/>Darkness comprehended it not.</HI> Holding by the Hand also, and as it were leading by the Hand those that being ensnared in Chains of Darkness, and thrust down into the Pit, do not wink with their Eyes, to the further blinding of them, but according to the Council of Christ himself, believe in the <HI>Light</HI> whilst they have it, that they may become Chil∣dren of the <HI>Light: For I am the Light of the World,</HI> (saith <HI>CHRIST</HI>) <HI>he that followeth me shall not walk in Darkness, but shall have the Light of Life;</HI> also, <HI>I am come a Light into the World, that whosoever believeth in me may not remain in Darkness,</HI> John 12.46, &amp;c. <HI>I came not to damn the World, but to save the World.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. In this Manner therefore is CHRIST the <HI>Salvation of the World,</HI> as he is the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> destroying the Works of the Devil, who hath wrought in the Darkness to the setting up of a <HI>Principa∣lity</HI> and a <HI>Kingdom to himself</HI> in the Hearts of Men, and redeeming Men from the Power of the Prince of the Darkness of this World unto God, who
<PB N="14" REF="005393_0013_101732EBF5675B30"/>is <HI>Light,</HI> and to see <HI>Light,</HI> even the <HI>Light of Life</HI> in his <HI>Light, Psalm</HI> 18.28, 29, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. In like manner doth the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> affirm <HI>CHRIST to be given of God for a Covenant to the People for a Light to the Nations, to open the blind Eyes, and to bring out of Prison them that sit in Darkness, even the Blind, which have Eyes and see not,</HI> Isa. 42.6, &amp;c. And after him <HI>Paul</HI> testifyeth, that <HI>Christ was set as a Light to the Nations, that he might be the Lords Salvation to the Ends of the Earth. Simion</HI> also speaking by the holy Spirit of the Child JESUS, call him that <HI>Salvation of his which the Lord had prepared before the Face of all People, to be a Light to lighten the Nations and the Glory of his People</HI> Israel, Luke 2.30.</P>
<P N="10">10. In as much therefore as CHRIST is the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> he is the <HI>Saviour of the World,</HI> and so far only are men saved by him as they believe in him, who is the <HI>Light,</HI> and in that <HI>Light</HI> where with he doth <HI>enlighten</HI> e∣very Man, in his own Conscience, and
<PB N="15" REF="005393_0014_10173321A20CA4F0"/>set themselves to walk after it, which leads no Man into Iniquity; and so far forth are all Men liable to Condem∣nation before God, as they walk not in this, which is in them, howbeit, not consenting to any, but testifying against all Iniquity, even the least, and also re∣proving and condemning it, even in them, who are not in it, but walking contrary to it in the <HI>Darkness.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. For altho' God in his great Love gave his Son for a <HI>Light,</HI> not that he might <HI>damn the World,</HI> but that <HI>the World through him might be sav'd;</HI> and he that <HI>believeth in him is not condemned,</HI> yet he <HI>that believes not is condemned already;</HI> and <HI>this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World,</HI> into the inmost Consciences of Men, their manifesting Good and Evil, <HI>but Men loved the Dark∣ness rather than the Light, because their Deeds are evil; for he that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his Deeds should be reproved; but whoso doth Truth, he cometh to the Light, that his deeds may be made Ma∣nifest,
<PB N="16" REF="005393_0015_101732F067C751B0"/>that they are wrought in God,</HI> John 3.16 to 21.</P>
<P N="12">12. And altho' all that obtain <HI>Jus∣tification,</HI> are <HI>justified freely,</HI> by the <HI>Grace of the Lord,</HI> through the <HI>Redemp∣tion</HI> that is made in JESUS CHRIST a∣lone, (yea cursed be he, and cursed will he be, that seeks for <HI>Justification</HI> any otherway; for he who is the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> is also that corner Stone which (however it be set at naught by a thousand thousand, of the Builders) is yet made the Head of the Corner; neither is there Salvation in any other, nor is there any other Name save that of CHRIST the Light, under Heaven given among Men, whereby they must be saved, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.11, 12. Nevertheless no further is any Man accepted of God, or justified by CHRIST, or the Grace of God in CHRIST, then as he is directed by CHRIST the <HI>Light,</HI> and is by the Grace of God, by that <HI>inward Witness</HI> of God, by the <HI>Light</HI> of God and CHRIST in his Conscience, which is given of God for this very End, that it may teach and lead, taught and
<PB N="17" REF="005393_0016_101733249CABC860"/>led unto <HI>Repentance</HI> from the unfruitful Works of <HI>Darkness.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. For this <HI>Light</HI> shews the <HI>riches of the Goodness and Long-suffering, and forbearance of him who is Long-suf∣fering to usward, not willing that any should Perish, but that all should come to him by Repentance, and is that very Grace of God bringing Salvation, that hath ap∣peared to all Men, teaching all that will learn what it teacheth, that denying Un∣godliness and worldly Lusts, they should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present World,</HI> which kind of <HI>Life</HI> will otherwise be two late to begin to live in the World to come; which Grace being received in Vain, how much more being despised, by the hardness of the Heart, refusing to repent, <HI>wrath is trea∣sured up against the Day of wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God, who will render unto every one according to his Works, to them who by patient Continuance in well doing, seek for Glory and immortality, eternal Life; but unto them that are Contentious, and obey not the Truth, but obey Unrighteous∣ness,
<PB N="18" REF="005393_0017_101732F35F8021F8"/>Indignation and Wrath: For</HI> Rom. 2. <HI>Tribulation and Anguish is to come upon every Soul of Man that worketh Evil; but Glory, Honour and Peace to every one that worketh Good, both to the Jew and also to the Greek: For there is no respect of Persons with God; but in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteousness, is accepted with him;</HI> but the wicked, and him that loveth Violence, his Soul hateth.</P>
<P N="14">14. And howsoever the World which is called <HI>Christian,</HI> together with the manifold Sects, Professors and meerly <HI>nominal Christians</HI> and Ministers thereof, may dream that they have CHRIST their Redeemer, very often calling him LORD, JESUS, continuing in the mean Time in all Disobedience to his <HI>Light; yet the Foundation of the Lord siandeth sure, having this Seal, the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one that nam∣eth the Name of</HI> CHRIST <HI>depart from I∣niquity.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. For the Day of the Lord draw∣eth nigh, wherein both every Man and his Deeds shall be made manifest;
<PB N="19" REF="005393_0018_101733290663D570"/>for the Day, which is the <HI>Light,</HI> shall declare them; for they shall be <HI>revealed by Fire,</HI> and the <HI>Fire shall try every Mans Works of what sort they are;</HI> and in that Day all those Dreamers shall be awakened, and shall know, that as concerning the <HI>Truth, they have erred</HI> far from the Mark; and <HI>that not every one that saith unto</HI> CHRIST, <HI>Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth what Christ saith, and what the will is of his Father which is in Hea∣ven,</HI> and tho' they have prophecy'd in his Name, and done great Things, nevertheless <HI>for as much as they departed not from Iniquity,</HI> they shall be doom'd from CHRIST with <HI>Depart from me, ye wor∣kers of Iniquity, I know you not.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. Then shall the whole Multitude of Transgressors of the Law, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the <HI>Light of God</HI> in the Conscience, by which all, even those that have not the Law written in an outward Letter, <HI>are a Law to themselves,</HI> having the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, That the Lamb of God came not to tolerate, but to take away the Sin of the World,
<PB N="20" REF="005393_0019_101732F4E72E5D70"/>and that Jesus was sent, not to give <HI>liber∣ty</HI> to Sin, but to <HI>set his People at Liber∣ty from their Sins,</HI> and that in the greatest Liberty, wherewith CHRIST freeth his People, there is the least Licence, and that the Father having raised up his Son, hath sent him to bless Men, they turn∣ing away every one of them from his Iniquity, and that those blessed ones, to whom the Lord imputeth not Sin, whose Iniquities are forgiven, and whose Sin is covered, are such in whose Spirit there is no Guile, and that there is in no Wise any Remission of Sins unto those, who still accustom themselves to daily Com∣mission of them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.14, 15. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.20. <HI>Psalm</HI> 32.1, 2. <HI>Act.</HI> 3.26. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11, 26,</P>
<P N="17">17. Moreover <HI>the great and terrible Day of the Lord now cometh,</HI> wherein the <HI>Light,</HI> which is risen in the Consciencies of Men, shall daily more and more clear∣ly shine forth, in which also the Book of Conscience must be opened, that out of it <HI>all Men may be judged accord∣ing to all Things that are written therein,</HI> where, by the <HI>Light,</HI> which is God's
<PB N="21" REF="005393_0020_1017332C017BE5E8"/>faithful Witness, all Sin is written down in the Sight of God, as with a Pen of Iron; in which Day, by the Light, God will come nigh to us to Judg∣ment; and then the Righteousness, Grace and Mercy of God shall be revealed to∣wards all, who, standing still in his <HI>Light,</HI> wait for him to come as a Redeemer to them from their Impieties, that they <HI>may be saved from the Wrath, that is to come upon all the Children of Disobe∣dience,</HI> by which Light <HI>the Wrath of God shall be manifested from Heaven</HI> in their own Consciences, <HI>against all Un∣godliness and Unrighteousness of Men, who retain the Truth in Unrighteous∣ness; in which Day God will rain down upon the Wicked, Snares, Fire, Brimstone, and an horrible Tempest, all which Things shall be the Portion of their Cup.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. Moreover in the Hand of God <HI>there is now a Cup and the Wine thereof is red, and it is full of Mixture, and he poureth out of the same, and Judgment is begun at the House of God,</HI> and God hath begun to bring evil upon the Peo∣ple, upon whom his <HI>Name</HI> is written,
<PB N="22" REF="005393_0021_101732F9508B6D88"/>and his <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Image</HI> is imprinted; and <HI>they, whose Portion it is not,</HI> in such a measure as they have drunk of the <HI>Cup</HI> of <HI>Abomination</HI> and <HI>Fornication,</HI> have drunk also of the <HI>Cup of Indignation</HI> and <HI>Wrath,</HI> before they could take the <HI>Cup of Salvation,</HI> and praise the <HI>Name of the Lord, in no wise</HI> therefore <HI>shall the Wick∣ed go unpunished, but the Worshippers of the Beast, and those that receive his I∣mage must drink also of this Wine, which is poured out of the Mixture into the Cup of his</HI> Indignation <HI>and shall be tormented with Fire and Brimstone in the Presence of the</HI> holy Angels, and of the Lamb; <HI>yea, the very Dregs hereof,</HI> the Top whereof the <HI>Children of the Light</HI> and of <HI>the Day</HI> have tasted, the <HI>Children of the Night</HI> and of <HI>the Darkness,</HI> that is all the wicked ones of the Earth shall <HI>drink</HI> and <HI>wring them out.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. Wherefore whilst in the long suffering of God, Opportunity is not wanting unto you, whilst the Day of your <HI>Visitation</HI> is near unto you from God, let my Council be accepted of you all, and turn your selves to the <HI>Light</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="005393_0022_1017332D87371F48"/>of CHRIST in your <HI>own Consciences,</HI> and take Council thereat forever, which se∣riously and sincerely minding, you shall be taught by CHRIST himself, whose <HI>Testimony</HI> to you, from Heaven, that is, to your both <HI>external, internal</HI> and <HI>eter∣nal</HI> Peace and Salvation, and shall be brought to CHRIST himself, and to see him, and his Father from both whom it comes, to the saving Knowledge of whom there can be no coming any other Way whatsoever; for as the Sun of this <HI>outward World</HI> is not seen, but by that <HI>Light</HI> which flows from it self unto us, so neither is the <HI>Son of Righteousness,</HI> but by that Measure of <HI>Light</HI> (how little soever it be) that shines from him in the Heart.</P>
<P N="20">20. For although the Scripture which speaks of the <HI>Light,</HI> and directs to the <HI>Light</HI> maketh mention of the Father and of the Son, so that there ye may read of them, and speak of them also, ac∣cording to what ye there read; yet this the Scripture it self witnesseth that none can know either the Father or the Son, but he to whom the Father and the
<PB N="24" REF="005393_0023_101732FC4DD30448"/>Son do mutually reveal each the other, whose <HI>Revelation</HI> also is made within, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.27. <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.16. <HI>for that which may be known of God,</HI> sufficient to Sal∣vation, <HI>is manifest to Men,</HI> (saith Paul) <HI>for God doth manifest it in them,</HI> and the <HI>Gospel is preached in every Creature which is under Heaven,</HI> Rom. 1.16. Col. 1.23. by the <HI>Light</HI> of God in the Conscience, so that they are left inexcusable before God, (who else would be excusable and blameless) forasmuch as though <HI>they know God, yet they glorified him not as God, nei∣ther like to retain God in their Know∣ledge, but knowing the Judgment of God, that they which do such Things,</HI> as they do, <HI>are worthy of Death, yet not only do the same, but have Pleasure in those that do them.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. In the mean while we do not af∣firm CHRIST himself to be in all Men, who yet is known to be in all that are not <HI>Reprobates,</HI> as <HI>that hope of Glory;</HI> ne∣vertheless all (for there is no Difference, but what is made by different <HI>degrees of Light,</HI> which do not vary the Nature of the Thing) have some Measure or other
<PB N="25" REF="005393_0024_101732569A6A8ED8"/>of his <HI>Light</HI> at least <HI>one Talent</HI> com∣mitted to them, that they may trade therewith to profit withal, which u∣sing well, and doubling they have en∣trance into the <HI>Joy of their Lord,</HI> but hiding of which and not gaining there∣with, they shall be thrust out at last from the <HI>Light</HI> they have, into the <HI>utter Darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of Teeth:</HI> This <HI>Light</HI> therefore shines in all even the Heathen, in some Measure, although not in all in the same Measure.</P>
<P N="22">22. To the Measure of which <HI>Light</HI> of CHRIST, which in you is, you will do well to take heed while you have it, as unto a <HI>Light</HI> shining in a <HI>dark Place,</HI> to give you the Knowledge of your Sal∣vation, and <HI>guide your Feet in the Way of Peace,</HI> and that you may find true rest to your burdened and wearied Souls, and lest <HI>Darkness come upon you, for he that walketh in Darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth, nor at what he stum∣bles.</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. This <HI>Light</HI> is the Law of God, (for the Law is <HI>Light</HI> says the wise Man)
<PB N="26" REF="005393_0025_101732FDD3693D00"/><HI>Pro.</HI> 6.23. written not with <HI>Ink,</HI> but with the <HI>Spirit of the living God,</HI> not in <HI>Tables of Stone,</HI> (as of old for a Figure hereof, by the Finger of God) but in <HI>fleshly Ta∣bles of the Heart;</HI> in which may be read and understood not only (as in the Scriptures and the Law without) the Right, that is, what you should do and should be, but the Fact also, that is, what you do, and what you are; For to know thy self, whom if thou knowst not, thou knowest not CHRIST, whom if thou knowest not, its no profit to thee to know other Things, this comes no o∣ther Way then by an <HI>inward beholding of thy self</HI> in that more <HI>inward looking-Glass,</HI> namely the <HI>Light</HI> of CHRIST, by which God shines in the Consci∣ence, which <HI>Light</HI> leads those that fol∣low it to hear that <HI>true and living Word of God,</HI> of which the Scripture declares, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. <HI>That it's powerful and mighty, and Sharper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing of the Soul and Spirit, and of the Marrow and Reins, discerning the Thoughts and Cogi∣tations of the Heart before which, all
<PB N="27" REF="005393_0026_10173334E3B6A3A0"/>Things are naked and bare;</HI> that it is as a <HI>Fire,</HI> and as an <HI>Hammer</HI> breaking the Rocks in Pieces, and causing all Things to tremble at the hearing thereof; which was in the beginning, before the Scripture was, which testifies of it, con∣cerning which, the Scripture both Old and New doth truly testify, <HI>it's not far off, but nigh in the Heart and Mouth, that thou mayest do it, even that very Word of Faith the Apostles preach∣ed.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. This <HI>Light</HI> is that <HI>good old Way,</HI> older than the eldest among the Sects of this Age, whether of <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Christians,</HI> who (all in the mean Time, namely both <HI>Catholicks,</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Cal∣vinists,</HI> and <HI>Baptists,</HI> &amp;c. every one pro∣fessing to be the Antientest) have divi∣ded the Grand Tree of the old <HI>Roman Church,</HI> into so many Branches, lesser Boughs and little Twigs, that the whole Body thereof, will ere long be sick even unto Death, and she who hath been so long the Mother of so many Children, is almost now devoured of her own Chil∣dren. This <HI>Light</HI> (I say) is that Anti∣ent
<PB N="28" REF="005393_0027_10173300CDB304E0"/>Way, unto which God by the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> called back the <HI>Israe∣lites,</HI> when degenerated from God into their own Traditions, saying, <HI>Stand in the Ways and see, and ask for the anti∣ent Paths, where is that good Way, walk therein, and you shall find rest unto your Souls;</HI> but they said, <HI>we will not walk therein; hearken to the Voice of the Trum∣pet,</HI> but they said, <HI>We will not hearken Jer.</HI> 6.16.</P>
<P N="25">25. This <HI>Light</HI> is a <HI>Teacher</HI> that cannot deceive, for it's the Testimony of God, which is greater than the Testimony of Man; nor yet can it flatter, for it re∣proves every one justly, not justifying the wicked, and condemning the Inno∣cent, but telling every one the Truth concerning himself directly as the Case is, and no otherwise, <HI>accusing</HI> or <HI>excu∣sing</HI> than God himself, from whom it is; for if by that which is shining from God in thee, thy own Heart <HI>condemns thee,</HI> there is no God without that holds the Guiltless; but when by that <HI>thy Heart condemns thee not, then mayest thou have Boldness before God,</HI> 1 John 3.20, 21.</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="29" REF="005393_0028_10173337E2F7D010"/>
26. Finally this <HI>Light</HI> is that <HI>perfect Law of Liberty,</HI> of which whoso <HI>is a hearer and not a doer, he is like a Man that beholds his natural Face in a Glass, which so soon as ever he hath beheld, and is gone away, he straitway forgets what manner of Man he was; but whoso looketh into it, and continueth therein, and is not a forgetful, and an idle Hearer, but a doer of the Work, this Man shall be blessed in his Deed,</HI> Jam. 1.25.</P>
<P N="27">27. Henceforth therefore, who e're thou art, who wouldest know thy self, do not seek thy self out of thy self, but behold thy self, within in that <HI>in∣ward Light,</HI> which <HI>inwardly</HI> gives the discerning, not only of the good and per∣fect Mind and will of God concerning thee, but also of thy own Mind and of thy whole self, and that so perfectly, that concerning these, and even all Things pertaining to the Salvation of the Soul and the Kingdom of God, with the Righteousness thereof, and what he∣reditary Right thou hast therein, which is nigh, which is <HI>within,</HI> (saith CHRIST to the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> Luk. 17.20, 21. who
<PB N="30" REF="005393_0029_101733053A934510"/>never entred into it) there is no need that thou shouldest go forth of thy self, in order to a further Evidence and Under∣standing of them: Yea thou knowest more than enough already, if of the good Will of God thou knowest more than thou livest up to, for what Good is only known, and not done, tends only unto thy Condemnation: In all Openness and Plainness, and not in knowing what is to be done, but in doing what is alrea∣dy known stands the Salvation of the Sons of Men.</P>
<P N="28">28. Moreover what hinders (unless they be delighted in the blinding of their own Eyes, the stopping of their Ears, and the hardening of their Hearts, and in re∣jecting the Council of God to their own Perdition) but that the Wicked may come to the Life of God, from which they stand estranged? for the Way to that Life, howere it's narrower and straiter by Reason of the <HI>Cross of</HI> CHRIST, which is <HI>daily to be taken up</HI> by those that follow him, than <HI>that wide and broad Way that leads to Destruction,</HI> for which cause it is that so many enter in
<PB N="31" REF="005393_0030_1017333966AC92E0"/>by this, and so few by the other, yet is, together with that which tends unto Death, so plainly made manifest by the <HI>Light</HI> that (unless it be to such as are willingly Ignorant) it cannot easily be hidden.</P>
<P N="29">29. For the Fruits of the Spirit or Works of the <HI>Light,</HI> which are <HI>Righte∣ousness, Love, Goodness, Faith, Gentle∣ness, Sobriety, Temperance, Chastity,</HI> which whoso brings forth to God, lives with God, and sees God, are manifest to every one that doth not wink against the Light in his own Conscience; and the Works of Darkness or of the Flesh, such as are <HI>Adultry, Fornication, Un∣cleanness, Lascíviousness, Idolatry, Witch∣craft, Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envy, Murders, Drunkenness, Revellings, and such like,</HI> which whoever doth <HI>shall ne∣ver enter into the Kingdom of God, are Manifest</HI> (saith the Scripture) <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.19. ad 23. and that not so much by the Scripture, as by the <HI>Light</HI> to which the Scripture Testifies, and by which they were manifest in the Consciences of Men,
<PB N="32" REF="005393_0031_10173308388ED220"/>before the Scripture was, and are made manifest at this Day where the Scripture is not, by which also they would have been made manifest if the Scripture had never been; <HI>For all things that are reproved</HI> (saith the Spirit, in the Scripture) <HI>are made manifest by the</HI> Light, <HI>for whatsoever doth make Manifest is</HI> Light <HI>Eph.</HI> 5, 13.</P>
<P N="30">30. To this therefore all apply your Minds, to this come, in this walk and continually abide, even in the Spirit of God, which reproveth the World, and comforteth the Saints called, redeemed and chosen out of the World: Here stand continually, that ye may both know your selves, and comprehend false Spi∣rits with the Works and <HI>Children of Darkness,</HI> who are comprehended and discerned by the Spirit, by the <HI>Light,</HI> altho' these comprehend neither it, nor it's Children; and that Grace, Mercy and Peace, may be multiplied to you from God the Father, and from JESUS CHRIST, whose Council in the Conscience, whosoever hearkens to shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from even the fear of
<PB N="33" REF="005393_0032_1017333C671952B8"/>Evil: For this is a brazen Wall to a Man to be inwardly Conscious to him∣self of no Evil; not to wax pale at the Sense of any Crime.</P>
<P N="31">31. But whoso turns aside from the <HI>Light,</HI> leaving the Paths of <HI>Righteousness</HI> to walk in the Ways of <HI>Darkness,</HI> as he is <HI>inwardly condemned</HI> of himself, so both Error and Terror do meet him at every Turn, so that howbeit he carries outwardly a shew of Laughter and Mirth, yet he goes often grievously griped, and within waxes pale at the Sense of that which the Wife of his own bosom is Ignorant of.</P>
<P N="32">32. All these Things abovesaid, which at first were written in <HI>Latin</HI> more pri∣vately, for the sake and use of a singu∣lar eminent Friend in Germany, are now with no other Alteration than the Case requires, not without God him∣self also moving thereunto, given forth more publickly, in Service to you, (O Academians) and all others, to whom <HI>we are ready,</HI> according to <HI>Peters</HI> Coun∣sel, <HI>to render a Reason of the Faith, which is in us,</HI> with Meekness and Fear hav∣ing
<PB N="34" REF="005393_0033_10173309C1988220"/>a good Conscience; and to this End that both ye, whose Ears being turned away from the Truth, are turned into Fables, and ye, who itching and attend∣ing to no other Business than telling and hearing some new Thing, suppose we bring certain strange and new Doctrines to your Ears, may know that we bring no new Things, but all the old Things, even the self same, which by Gods Ministers were uttered from the very be∣ginning; which also we know either to your Salvation, or greater Condemnati∣on, your selves shall once acknowledge even forever.</P>
<P N="33">33. Of which yet we are not slack to warn, and by Admonition to awaken you, forasmuch as though to say the same Things that were said before, its not grievous to us, yet for you it's safe, who, by overmuch Incognitancy, and Inadvertency (I may truly say) are Ig∣norant of what ye know.</P>
<P N="34">34. Which truly if in the same <HI>Light,</HI> and with the same sincere Spirit, with which they were written, they may be thoroughly perused by any, it shall repent
<PB N="35" REF="005393_0034_10173340D14CD540"/>neither me to have writ, nor you to have read what is here written.</P>
<P N="35">35. But if otherwise, and if this friend∣ly Word of your Salvation shall stir up in you the Spirit of Enmity and Malig∣nity, and receive from you rather an ignominious Repulse, than an healthful Hearkening thereunto, it shall Please me enough that in this Work I have pleased God, and am clear of the Blood of your Souls, and ye at last shall re∣member at least (yet not without Re∣pentance tho' too late) that ye were warned from God.</P>
