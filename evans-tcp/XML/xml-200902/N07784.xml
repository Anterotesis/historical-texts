<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the Study of <HI>Ethics</HI> makes so great a Part of an academical Education, and there are Professors of that Science in most of the Universities in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> I have, for many Years past, been in Quest of some System of that Kind, proper to be recited by the Students; but can find none well adapted to that Purpose. For though there are many Treatises which contain good Rules of external Conduct, yet the Obligation to act according to those Rules, is not justly stated; and several insufficient and false Foundations are laid down by Authors of considerable Note.</P>
<P>It seems necessary that the Students should first be well instructed in the true Nature of <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> and the Foundation of our <HI>Obligations</HI> to practise it, before they read the practical Rules which are formed thereupon.</P>
<P>As this Treatise was designed, principally, for the Use of the Students of this College, I have, to save the Charge of Printing, wrote in as concise
<PB N="ii" REF="009931_0003_0F7B3B8656D26840"/>
a Manner, as can be intelligible, on such a cri∣tical and metaphysical Subject. If any Expressions should seem doubtful, I may be present to explain and enlarge upon them: And if this should happen to fall into the Hands of any Gentleman at a Distance, who should suppose that any Expression is capable of such a Construction, as is not consistent with Truth, I would ask the Favour of an Opportunity to explain myself.</P>
<P>In treating upon the divine Ideas, I have ge∣nerally follow'd the Sentiments and Expressions in <HI>Norris's Ideal World.</HI></P>
<P>As this Treatise contains only short Hints or Heads to be paraphras'd upon, but few Copies are printed at present; proposing that if God should spare my Life, and give me some Relaxation from my present Multiplicity of Business, to publish a more full and complete Treatise upon this Subject, which I look upon to be of great Importance, be∣cause it contains the moral Part of all <HI>true Reli∣gion,</HI> which is the Foundation of the Whole: Tho' no fallen Creature can become <HI>truly virtuous,</HI> but in Consequence of an Atonement, and the renovating Influences of the divine Spirit: And I suppose that Men generally form their Sentiments of the peculiar Doctrines of Christianity, according to some few <HI>moral Principles,</HI> which they <HI>at first</HI> set out upon, relating to the Holiness and Strictness of the divine Law, and the Nature of <HI>moral Obligation.</HI></P>

<P N="1">§ 1. <SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S Ethics or Moral Philoso∣phy, makes a considerable Part of an academical Edu∣cation, and is nearly con∣nected with true Religion, it is of great Importance that it should be <HI>clearly stated,</HI> and fixed upon the right <HI>Foundation.</HI> — Authors are generally agreed in the Rules of external Conduct, for the general Good of Communities and particular Persons; but differ greatly in the <HI>Foundation</HI> of the <HI>Obligation</HI> to observe those Rules, and in the <HI>Criterion of moral Good and Evil.</HI> Most Authors have treated up∣on <HI>Ethics</HI> as a System of <HI>moral Rules</HI> of Conduct, summarily comprehended in the ten Command∣ments; and as the moral Part of practical Re∣ligion: But then the separating of this from the Doctrines or Principles of Religion, upon which it is founded, has been the Occasion of several
<PB N="2" REF="009931_0005_0F7B3B89EAD1F1D0"/>
Mistakes; and particularly this, that many have treated <HI>Ethics</HI> only as the Laws of Nature and Nations, or a System of <HI>civil Laws,</HI> generally obtaining among Mankind, and calculated prin∣cipally to promote the temporal Good of public Communities and particular Persons, in their enjoying the natural Pleasures and Happiness of the present Life. Others have, as it were, part∣ly blended both these together, and from thence have formed a System of what they call the <HI>Re∣ligion of Nature,</HI> whereby every Man may ob∣tain the Favour of God and eternal Happiness, by his own Powers, without a Mediator or any divine Revelation. <HI>Ethics,</HI> in this View, have very much paved the Way to Deism; and therefore have been justly opposed by many good Men.<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Dr. C. MATHER (in his <HI>Introductio ad Ministerium</HI>) calls it <HI>Impietas in Artis Formam redacta.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">§ 2. And as Men have had very different Views of the ultimate End and Design of <HI>Ethics;</HI> so they have set out upon very different <HI>Grounds</HI> and <HI>Foundations,</HI> to build their several Systems upon: Some upon the Foundation of <HI>Self-Interest</HI> and Happiness; some upon univer∣sal <HI>Benevolence,</HI> and some upon <HI>moral Taste;</HI> and others upon various other first Principles, which are either false, or but consequential Appendages to the true Foundation. To rectify these Mis∣takes, and to settle the Nature of <HI>moral Virtue and Obligation</HI> upon its just and true Foundation, is the Design of the present Essay.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="009931_0006_0F7B3B8AA2B6BBE8"/>§ 3. And, therefore,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I shall consider the Nature and Standard of moral Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Obligation, which every moral Agent is under, to be conformed to that Standard.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Way whereby we may come to the Knowledge of that Standard, and of such a Temper and Conduct as is a Conformity to it.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> I shall exhibit a brief and general Scheme of moral Virtues and Duties.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I shall consider the Nature and Stan∣dard of moral Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Moral Virtue</HI> is a Conformity to the <HI>moral Perfections of God;</HI> or it is an Imitation of God, in the moral Perfections of his Nature, so far as they are imitable by his Creatures. And the moral Perfections of God are the <HI>sole</HI> Foundation and Standard of all that Virtue, Goodness and Perfection which can exist in the Creature.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. For God is a being infinitely and abso∣lutely perfect. He has all those Perfections which are contained or implied in the Words <HI>good, right, excellent, amiable,</HI> and all other Words of the like Import—all those Perfections which can possibly exist, or that can be con∣ceived of by the most perfect Intelligent: For there can be no Limitation of Perfection in a necessary and <HI>self-existent</HI> Being.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. Indeed we get the Idea of a Perfection from those small Degrees of Perfection which we observe in the Creatures, and then we as∣cribe all Perfections to God, in an infinite De∣gree;
<PB N="4" REF="009931_0007_0F7B3B8ACEAE4918"/>
and unite them all in the Idea of ONE ALL-PERFECT BEING.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. So that, in the Order of our Conceptions, we conceive of a Perfection as existing in the Creature, <HI>before</HI> we conceive of it as existing in God, and generally (it may be) before we have any Idea of God at all. And therefore we are apt to conceive (or, at least, to use some Ex∣pressions as if we did conceive) some Perfections to have an independent Existence <HI>out of</HI> God, and <HI>prior</HI> to him; and as if we would <HI>try</HI> him by that Standard, and approve of his Qualities according as we conceived them to be agreeable to it. But this is a great Mistake: For all Perfection is originally in God, as the <HI>primary</HI> Foundation and Standard, and from that Foun∣tain is communicated to the Creatures, in vari∣ous limited Degrees, according to their several Ranks and Orders.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. As his Being includes and comprehends all Perfection; so no Perfection can possibly ex∣ist in the Creature, or be conceived by him, but what first existed in the Creator: Neither can it have any innate Excellency or permanent Ex∣istence, but only so far as it resembles Some∣thing in God, and is dependent upon him. The Perfection of the Creature consists in his <HI>Resemblance</HI> or <HI>Conformity</HI> to God; but the Per∣fection of God consists in his being <HI>what he is,</HI> or like to <HI>himself,</HI> as the primary Standard; without any antecedent or concomitant Rule or Standard to measure himself by.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="5" REF="009931_0008_0F7B3B8B86B59720"/>§ 8. <HI>Self-Existence</HI> or necessary Existence, without any antecedent Cause or Foundation, is the first <HI>fundamental</HI> Perfection we conceive of in God; and from <HI>that</HI> all other Perfections necessarily <HI>result;</HI> such as Eternity, Immutabi∣lity, Omnipresence, Omniscience, Omnipotence, Wisdom, &amp;c. Indeed, all Perfection in God is, in some Respect, <HI>one;</HI> that is, all Perfection is, in him, <HI>one</HI> simple, uncompounded, uniform Thing: But our Minds are not capacious enough to form such a comprehensive, clear Idea; and therefore we must conceive of each particular Perfection, <HI>distinctly</HI> by itself, or our Ideas of them will be confused.</P>
<P N="9">§ 9. We usually conceive of the divine Per∣fections under two general Heads:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Natural Perfections;</HI> such as Eternity, Immutability, Omniscience, Omnipotency, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Moral Perfections;</HI> such as Holiness, Jus∣tice, Goodness and Truth; which are called the <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> of the divine Nature.</P>
<P><HI>Natural</HI> Perfections, such as Knowledge, Power, &amp;c. may exist, in a great Degree, in a Being utterly destitute of <HI>moral</HI> Goodness or Holiness; and be perverted to the worst Ends and Purposes, as they are in the Devils. But <HI>moral</HI> Perfections, such as Justice, Goodness, and Truth, have an <HI>immutable</HI> Excellency and Amiableness in them, and cannot be directly perverted, without destroying their very <HI>Nature.</HI> There is indeed a necessary Connection between the natural and moral Perfections of God; for
<PB N="6" REF="009931_0009_0F7B3B8C44CD08D0"/>
Justice, Goodness and Truth presuppose some Degree of Knowledge and Power by which they are exercised; and Knowledge and Power must be regulated by Justice and Goodness, or other∣wise they lose the Excellency of their Nature, and are to be dreaded rather than loved.</P>
<P N="10">§ 10. When God makes a <HI>Creature,</HI> he com∣municates to him some Degree of his own Per∣fections, though, being limited, they cannot exist in the same Form and Manner, but under different Circumstances from what they are in the Creator. These <HI>different</HI> Degrees of Per∣fection, thus communicated, constitute the <HI>dif∣ferent Ranks</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of the Creatures. To the Inanimates he communicates but little more than bare Existence. On the Vegetables he im∣presses a uniform Motion of the nutritive Parts, with a proper Cohesion. To Animals he com∣municates an animal Motion and Life, with an Instinct to preserve their Lives and continue their Species, in which they discover a Sagacity very nearly resembling Reason. To <HI>Man</HI> he has communicated the superior Powers of <HI>Reason</HI> and Understanding, whereby he is capable of forming some Ideas of the natural and moral Perfections of God and his Works; of compar∣ing the Ideas of Things, and of drawing just Inferences and Deductions.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. When any Creature is endued with such a Degree of Understanding and <HI>Reason,</HI> as to be capable of conceiving of the <HI>natural</HI> Re∣lations of Things, and so of the <HI>natural</HI> Perfec∣tions
<PB N="7" REF="009931_0010_0F7B3B8D66B10B68"/>
of God; and is also, <HI>in some Measure,</HI> capable of understanding the Nature of Right and Wrong, or the <HI>moral</HI> Relations of Things, as compared with a <HI>Rule</HI> of right Conduct, and so of the <HI>moral</HI> Perfections of God; such a Be∣ing is called a MORAL AGENT and is capable of <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> and is the Subject of <HI>moral Go∣vernment and Obligation.</HI> The <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> Goodness or Excellency of such a <HI>moral Agent,</HI> consists in a <HI>Conformity</HI> to the <HI>moral Perfections of God,</HI> as the original Standard of all Perfection.</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. This Conformity is twofold; either internal and real, or only external and apparent.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Internal or real Virtue</HI> consists in an inward Temper and Disposition of Mind, which is <HI>like to God</HI> and conformable to the moral Perfections of his Nature; such as Holiness, Justice, Good∣ness and Truth. And this internal, <HI>divine Prin∣ciple</HI> will naturally produce a Course of <HI>external Actions</HI> conformable to it, as the natural Effect and Expression of it. And the <HI>ultimate</HI> End and Design of a Person endued with this Principle, will be to act in Conformity to the <HI>divine Per∣fections,</HI> and to do all to the <HI>Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="13">§ 13. (2.) <HI>External or apparent Virtue</HI> is such an external Conduct as may seem to be the vi∣sible Effect or Expression of this inward divine Principle; but, in Reality, is not; and proceeds from some <HI>lower</HI> Motive, such as Self-Interest, Honour, Fancy, or the like. Thus a Man may devote a considerable Part of his Estate to pub∣lick Uses civil and sacred, may be just and bene∣ficent
<PB N="8" REF="009931_0011_0F7B3B8DD794E938"/>
to his Neighbour, punctual to his Promi∣ses, and abstain from all bodily Excesses; and yet, in all these Things, have no Regard to <HI>God,</HI> but only to <HI>himself,</HI> to his own Interest, Reputation or Fancy. Although the Matter of these Actions is just and right, and agreeable to the <HI>divine Law;</HI> yet, as they do not proceed from a true <HI>Principle</HI> and right End, they are not really <HI>virtuous,</HI> nor so accounted by the Searcher of Hearts. Indeed the Heathen, who had no higher Principle, generally accounted such Actions to be <HI>virtuous;</HI> but <HI>divine Revela∣tion</HI> teaches us, that there can be no virtuous Actions without a divine Temper of Mind, in Conformity to the <HI>Perfections of God.</HI> <NOTE N="[x]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>2 Pet. 1.3.</HI> Add to your Faith Virtue. <HI>Eph. 4.24.

<P N="14">§ 14. Having considered the true Nature and original Standard of moral Virtue, I proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To consider the <HI>Obligation</HI> which every rational Creature and moral Agent is un∣der, to be conformed to the <HI>moral Perfections of God.</HI> This <HI>Obligation</HI> arises,</P>
<P N="1">I. And principally, from the <HI>infinite and ab∣solute Perfection</HI> of the divine Nature: For as
<PB N="9" REF="009931_0012_0F7B3B8EFB1657C0"/>
God is the most perfect Being, so the most <HI>per∣fect State</HI> of any other Being, must consist in being <HI>like to him.</HI> As he is the only <HI>self-existent</HI> Being, the original Standard of all Perfection, and all Creatures derive their several Degrees of Perfection from <HI>him,</HI> he must be the <HI>only Rule</HI> and Pattern for <HI>them;</HI> and their highest Perfec∣tion must consist in being <HI>like to</HI> the original and <HI>all-perfect</HI> Standard. The <HI>greater</HI> Degree of divine Perfection any Creature enjoys, the <HI>more</HI> perfect he must be.</P>
<P N="15">§ 15. Every Creature of God was originally made perfect, <HI>in his own Model</HI> or <HI>Degree;</HI> that is, its Degree of Perfection was uniform, so as to have no Part or Quality deficient, incongruous or repugnant to any other Part; or to have any two Dispositions or Qualities, which, in their own Nature, or under any Circumstances, could operate <HI>contrary</HI> to each other. The Perfection, therefore, of a rational Creature, must be to <HI>continue</HI> in that <HI>perfect</HI> State in which he was created: But to <HI>lose</HI> any Part of it, or to acquire any <HI>contrary</HI> Disposition or Quality, is a Defec∣tion from the most <HI>perfect Pattern and Standard,</HI> and a Destruction of the Works of God. This, in Scripture is called ANOMIA, a Deviation from the perfect Law of <HI>moral Rectitude,</HI> foun∣ded in the <HI>divine Nature.</HI> It is also called <HI>mo∣ral Depravity</HI> or <HI>Sin,</HI> and as it is the first Prin∣ciple of wrong Action, it is called <HI>Original Sin.</HI></P>
<P N="16">§ 16. And if a Creature has deviated from this Standard of Perfection, <HI>heretofore;</HI> that will
<PB N="10" REF="009931_0013_0F7B3B8F7511EC18"/>
not justify his Deviation from it, for the <HI>Time to come.</HI> For it will remain an eternal and immu∣table TRUTH, resulting from the Nature of God and the Relation of a rational Creature to him, that <HI>his</HI> Perfection consists in a Conformity to the Perfection of <HI>God;</HI> and that notwithstan∣ding his former Transgression or Defect has brought upon him a present Indisposition, Un∣willingness or <HI>Incapacity</HI> of such a perfect Con∣formity: For such an Indisposition or Incapacity is so far from being a Justification of his present State, or an Evidence of his being still in a State of Perfection, that, on the contrary, it is yet a further Deviation from the most perfect Stan∣dard; for a rational Creature's Indisposition or Incapacity of being like to God, renders him the more unlike to him.</P>
<P N="17">§ 17. Indeed all the Works of God, as they come from him, are perfect; and every Part of them congruous and consistent with each other; so that whenever he makes a <HI>moral Agent,</HI> he endues him with a perfect Disposition and full <HI>Powers</HI> to do his Duty, and be <HI>perfect,</HI> as such a Creature: But if he afterwards, by any Means, contracts a contrary Disposition, or loses his <HI>Power, that</HI> no ways alters the Nature of his <HI>Perfection,</HI> or the Nature of his <HI>Obligation.</HI> The Perfection of the Creature consists in a Conformity to God, <HI>after</HI> he has indisposed or incapacitated himself for it, as much as it did <HI>before.</HI> Notwithstansting all he can do, the same Truth will <HI>eternally</HI> remain, that <HI>his highest
<PB N="11" REF="009931_0014_0F7B3B9000FA84D0"/>
Perfection consists in a Conformity to God;</HI> and it is impossible that any Action of his should <HI>annul</HI> or make it void.</P>
<P N="18">§ 18. It is also inconsistent with the divine Perfections to suppose that God should <HI>release</HI> or <HI>discharge</HI> any moral Agent from his Obliga∣tion to a perfect Conformity to the divine Per∣fections; or that he should <HI>substitute</HI> any other Thing in the Room of it, as that he should only do his <HI>Endeavour,</HI> or <HI>as well as he can,</HI> or the like. For in every Thing wherein he falls short of a <HI>perfect Conformity</HI> to God, in the Disposi∣tion of his Mind, or Course of his Actions (ac∣cording to that <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> in which he is placed among the Creatures) it is his <HI>moral De∣fect,</HI> ANOMIA or Sin. And God's Favour and Approbation is necessarily extended to his Crea∣tures according to the Degree of their Likeness and Conformity to him.</P>
<P N="19">§ 19. Every rational Creature and moral A∣gent is <HI>obliged</HI> to be perfect and conformed to God, in the highest and strongest Sense in which that Word <HI>Obligation,</HI> is ever used. And all those Obligations which arise from Self-Interest, Hope, Fear, Gratitude, &amp;c. are but <HI>low and faint,</HI> in Comparison of this. Yea, God him∣self is frequently said (by way of Analogy) to be <HI>obliged</HI> to act according to his own Perfec∣tions: But this Obligation, in a more <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>primary Sense,</HI> is said to be incumbent upon his Creatures.</P>
<P N="20">§ 20. II. This Obligation arises, in a secon∣dary
<PB N="12" REF="009931_0015_0F7B3B91ABBA5DD0"/>
Sense, from the <HI>declared Will or Law of God:</HI> That is, as the <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of God de∣clare what the <HI>divine Perfections</HI> are; and what Temper and Conduct in <HI>us,</HI> is a Conformity to them: For this we could not certainly know, unless it was declared to us by the divine <HI>Law;</HI> which is therefore the <HI>more immediate Rule</HI> of our Conduct. Indeed if it could be supposed that two or more Actions, under some Circum∣stances, were <HI>equally,</HI> agreeable to all the Per∣fections of God, then, by his absolute <HI>sovereign</HI> Authority, he might enjoin either of them, by a particular positive Law.</P>
<P N="21">§ 21. III. This Obligation is increased by that <HI>sovereign Power and Authority</HI> which God has over us, as he is our Creator and we his Creatures. For as our Existence depends upon his <HI>meer</HI> Good-Will and Pleasure, we ought to exist in such a <HI>Manner</HI> and for such <HI>Purposes</HI> as are <HI>agreeable</HI> to him, and no other. And he being our sovereign Lord and Proprietor, it is direct <HI>Injustice</HI> to use or dispose of his <HI>Pro∣perty</HI> contrary to his <HI>Will:</HI> And therefore a Compliance with the <HI>Will</HI> of our Proprietor, is but a Conformity to his <HI>Justice;</HI> which is one of his divine Perfections.</P>
<P N="22">§ 22. So that all <HI>moral Virtue and Obligation,</HI> in whatever Light we view it, is to be resolved into a <HI>Conformity to the divine Perfections;</HI> and all the real Goodness and Excellency we can have, and all the Obligation we can be under, is to be <HI>like to God.</HI> The Good or Happiness
<PB N="13" REF="009931_0016_0F7B3B926811FEE0"/>
which results to <HI>us,</HI> from a Conformity to the divine Perfections, or the Fear of Punishment if we neglect it, do not properly <HI>make</HI> or <HI>create</HI> any Obligation; though they may be justly con∣sidered as <HI>subordinate</HI> Motives and Incentives to act <HI>according</HI> to the Obligations we were <HI>an∣tecedently</HI> under.</P>
<P N="23">§ 23. But this Principle, that <HI>the moral Per∣fections of God are the sole Foundation and Stan∣dard of moral Virtue and Obligation;</HI> has been denied by many celebrated Authors: and several other Foundations have been substituted in the Room of it: such as, Self-Interest and Happi∣ness—universal Benevolence—moral Taste and Sense — Conformity to Reason — to the moral Fitness of Things—acting according to Truth, and the like. But all these are either imperfect Descriptions of, or Consequences from the mo∣ral Perfections of God, or else they have no just Foundation at all. I shall particularly examine each of them.</P>
<P N="24">§ 24. I. Some assert that a Principle of <HI>Self-Love, Self-Interest,</HI> and <HI>Happiness,</HI> is the only <HI>Foundation of moral Virtue and Obligation,</HI> and of all Religion. That the <HI>only</HI> Motive to Acts of Justice and Kindness towards our Fellow∣men, is that they may in their Turns do the same to us. That the <HI>only</HI> Motive and Obliga∣tion to Obedience to the Laws of God, is to procure the divine Favour, to obtain Rewards
<PB N="14" REF="009931_0017_0F7B3B930CC73998"/>
and avoid Punishments. That we are not bound to pay any <HI>Regard to God,</HI> but only so far as he is <HI>subservient to us</HI> and our Happiness. And that, whatever Men may pretend, there cannot <HI>possibly</HI> be any <HI>other</HI> Obligation, Motive or Spring of Action, in human Nature, but only <HI>Self-Love</HI> and a Regard to our <HI>own</HI> Interest and Happiness. To this Purpose <HI>Campbell on moral Virtue,</HI> says, that <Q>all intelligent Agents can relish Nothing but Pleasure or Happiness, and are universally governed by the Principle of Self-Love<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pag. 97.</NOTE>.</Q> That <Q>they are irresistib∣ly, in all Instances, under the prevailing Pow∣er of Self-Love; so that we can <HI>no otherwise</HI> value or esteem Persons or Things than ac∣cording as they gratify this Principle, and serve to promote our <HI>own</HI> Interest and Hap∣piness<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE>.</Q> That <Q>the <HI>Virtue</HI> or Goodness of any moral Action, lies precisely in its Suita∣bleness to gratify <HI>one's Self-Love</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">319.</NOTE>.</Q> Bp. <HI>Gastrell,</HI> in his Sermons at <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lectures, says, that <Q>Happiness is the <HI>ultimate End</HI> of our Being and all our Actions<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pag. 121.</NOTE>.</Q> That <Q>the Power or Right of <HI>obliging</HI> is <HI>nothing else,</HI> but offering to the Mind a Motive either of Happiness to be obtain'd, or Misery to be avoided—and there is no <HI>other</HI> Notion or Ground of Obliga∣tion imaginable <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 91, 92.</NOTE>.</Q> That <Q>no Being has a Right or Power of obliging another, any fur∣ther than he has a Power of contributing to

his Happiness or Misery.</Q> That <Q>God can lay Men under <HI>no Obligation</HI> to obey him, any otherwise than by making them know that he has Power to make them <HI>happy or miserable</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page 96.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="25">§ 25. Now I concede that God has implant∣ed a Principle of <HI>Self-Love</HI> and Self-Preserva∣tion in all Animals: and that all Brutes and the greater Part of Mankind are in <HI>fact</HI> govern'd by that <HI>alone.</HI> And it is an Instance of the Wis∣dom of God in his providential Government of the World, that, since the greater Part of Man∣kind, in this fallen State, are destitute of any higher or better Principle, he has implanted <HI>this,</HI> which keeps the World in some good Order and Regulation. Men are generally agreed, that <HI>Lying, Stealing, Robbery, Piracy,</HI> &amp;c. are <HI>bad;</HI> and they seem generally to hate them; not from a Sense of the real MORAL EVIL of these Things in <HI>themselves,</HI> or their Contrariety to the holy <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of God; but as being contrary to the <HI>Happiness</HI> of the Community, and of <HI>ourselves.</HI> And therefore whenever we hear that any such Acts are done, every one im∣mediately has this Reflection, "It may be <HI>my</HI> Turn to be robbed next, and I wish the Actor was punished, in order to prevent it." I also suppose that a meer <HI>natural Man,</HI> in no Degree illuminated by the Divine Spirit, cannot in any <HI>human Way,</HI> be convinced of any <HI>moral Evil</HI> in Sin, but only by the natural ill Consequences
<PB N="16" REF="009931_0019_0F7B3B948537A9B0"/>
which attend it. Since therefore this Principle of Self-Love is implanted by God, and answers many good Ends, it is not to be eradicated; but regulated by, and made subservient to a Princi∣ple which is infinitely higher and better, viz. a Conformity to the moral Perfections of God; which is the <HI>Standard</HI> of the highest Perfection of human Nature.</P>
<P N="26">§ 26. In Pursuance therefore to this Princi∣ple of Self-Love and Happiness, a Man may thus reason with himself, <Q>I am one of the Creatures of God, placed in a certain Rank and Dignity in the Creation, and put into a Capacity of Happiness, under certain Re∣strictions and Limitations: I will therefore endeavour to promote my own Happiness, in Obedience to the Will of God, and princi∣pally that the Glory of his Goodness, Mercy and Wisdom might be displayed in it. And as God has committed the Care of <HI>myself</HI> more immediately to <HI>myself,</HI> I, considering myself as his Servant especially appointed to this Business, will, in Obedience to his Com∣mands, take especial Care to glorify him in this Way.</Q></P>
<P N="27">§ 27. But for a Man to make the <HI>sole, su∣preme,</HI> or <HI>ultimate End</HI> of all Being and Action to be for <HI>himself alone</HI> or his <HI>own</HI> Happiness, as the <HI>summum Bonum;</HI> and to regard God and all other Beings, only so far as they may <HI>serve himself</HI> or be subservient to his own Happiness, or <HI>gratify his Principle of Self-Love,</HI> is the most
<PB N="17" REF="009931_0020_0F7B3B9554A293D8"/>
absolute Inversion of the <HI>Order, Dignity</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> of Beings: and one of the worst Principles that can be in human Nature: it be∣ing as great an Absurdity, as it is to suppose, that <HI>a small Part is bigger than the Whole.</HI> And the Man who is known to act from no higher Prin∣ciple than this, as corrupt as the World is, will hardly be admitted to any publick Office or Trust in the civil State. The Stoicks seemed to have a better Notion of Virtue than this; for they supposed that Virtue was really <HI>amiable in itself,</HI> antecedent to the Advantage of it to Mankind.</P>
<P N="28">§ 28. Therefore all those Rules of <HI>pretended moral</HI> Conduct, which are formed <HI>meerly</HI> upon the Principles of <HI>Self-Love</HI> or a <HI>Ballance of Self-Interest</HI> among Mankind; altho' they may ans∣wer some good Purposes in <HI>civil Life,</HI> and as <HI>human Laws,</HI> may keep the World from many hurtful Disorders, yet they are far from being Rules of <HI>true moral Virtue;</HI> or Means whereby a Man may obtain the <HI>special</HI> Favour of God and eternal Happiness.</P>
<P N="29">§ 29. II. Another Principle set up as the <HI>sole</HI> Foundation of moral Virtue and Obligation, is universal <HI>Benevolence</HI> or <HI>good Will to all other Beings; God and the Creatures.</HI> That this Be∣nevolence is <HI>natural</HI> to all Mankind, and the <HI>only</HI> Duty enjoined in the <HI>Law of Nature;</HI> and that the <HI>only</HI> Obligation we can be under to obey any Law, is a Principle of <HI>Benevolence</HI> to our∣selves
<PB N="18" REF="009931_0021_0F7B3B9668BAECF8"/>
and others. To this Purpose Bp. <HI>Cumber∣land</HI> on the <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> says, that <Q>all moral Laws are summed up in Benevolence. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. I. § 9.</NOTE></Q> And that <Q>from hence all moral Virtue may be deduced. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">§ 10.</NOTE></Q> That <Q>Benevolence is a Will to pursue every one his own Happi∣ness, together with the Happiness of others. <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">§ 6.</NOTE></Q> That <Q>Happiness consists in the Possession of good Things. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">§ 5.</NOTE></Q> That <Q>moral Good is ultimately to be resolved into <HI>common natural Good.</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chap.

<P N="30">§ 30. Now I readily concede that <HI>Benevolence</HI> or a Disposition to <HI>do Good</HI> and <HI>promote the Hap∣piness</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="009931_0022_0F7B3B96E25250E0"/>
of others, is one very <HI>good Principle,</HI> and an Imitation of the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God. But this cannot be the <HI>sole</HI> Foundation of all moral Duty and Obligation, because this would be an Imita∣tion of <HI>one</HI> of the divine Perfections <HI>only,</HI> exclu∣sive of all the Rest; and every moral Agent is obliged to imitate the divine <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> as well as the divine <HI>Goodness.</HI> To conceive of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> only as <HI>Parts</HI> or subordinate Means of <HI>Goodness,</HI> is to confound our <HI>clear</HI> and distinct Ideas of the divine Perfections. If we conceive of Justice and Truth only as <HI>subservient</HI> to Goodness, then the Justice of God's <HI>Right of Dominion</HI> over us, consists <HI>only</HI> in its Advantage to us: and the <HI>Justice</HI> of any Punishment in∣flicted by God, consists <HI>only</HI> in this, that it is for the <HI>Good</HI> of the Creatures; and there is no Evil in God's declaring a <HI>Falshood,</HI> but only as it may bring <HI>Misery</HI> upon the Creatures. Which Sup∣positions evidently confound our <HI>clear</HI> Ideas of the divine Perfections, and all Morality.</P>
<P N="31">§ 31. When Man enjoyed the <HI>Image of God;</HI> and particularly participated of the di∣vine <HI>Goodness;</HI> he was endued with a Disposition to <HI>do Good,</HI> and promote the Happiness of all other Beings: but since the Fall, there is but a little of this Principle of universal and <HI>disinter∣ested</HI> Benevolence among Mankind. And all the <HI>Resemblance</HI> of it, in <HI>unregenerate</HI> Men, proceeds from a Principle of <HI>Self-Love;</HI> extended to the proper Means of promoting our own Happiness. For every Man who has not very contracted
<PB N="20" REF="009931_0023_0F7B3B97C0FF6EA0"/>
Views, will easily see that he cannot be very happy <HI>himself,</HI> unless others about him are so too; who, in their Turns, may help to happify him. And so, from a meer Principle of Self-Love, may observe the Rule of <HI>Doing as he would be done by;</HI> and may at length contract a <HI>Habit</HI> of doing some benevolent Acts, on a <HI>sud∣den,</HI> without any particular Reflection upon the Principle or Motives upon which such a Habit was originally formed. But this Principle of Benevolence, which in the present State is so im∣perfect, and at best is but <HI>one</HI> of the many Per∣fections which every moral Agent ought to be endued with, cannot be the <HI>sole, exclusive</HI> Foun∣dation of all moral Virtue.</P>
<P N="32">§ 32. It is easy to conceive of Benevolence to the <HI>Creatures,</HI> as a Disposition to promote their Happiness: but I can't easily conceive of what Bp. <HI>Cumberland</HI> means by <HI>Benevolence to God.</HI> He defines Benevolence to be <Q>a Will to pursue every one his <HI>own Happiness,</HI> together with the Happiness of others. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chap. I. S. 6.</NOTE></Q> And says he does <Q>not mean a <HI>lifeless Volition,</HI> which affects no∣thing; but that whereby we execute what we desire. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chap. I. S. 4.</NOTE></Q> That <Q>Benevolence universally produces a good Effect to the Person to whom we wish well. <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">S. 8.</NOTE></Q> That <Q>it is an Affection whereby we desire Things grateful or pleasing to God. <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">S. 4.</NOTE></Q> <Q>That is, which, by Way of
<PB N="21" REF="009931_0024_0F7B3B9844846EE0"/>
Analogy to Man, leaves his Mind in a State of <HI>Tranquility, Joy,</HI> or <HI>Complacency;</HI> which, he says may be safely ascribed to God. <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chap. V. Sec. 9.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P N="33">§ 33. Now, tho' we may and ought to con∣ceive with Pleasure, that the Happiness of God is absolutely <HI>perfect, necessary, eternal</HI> and <HI>im∣mutable;</HI> yet we cannot directly <HI>will, desire</HI> or <HI>endeavour</HI> that his Happiness should be either <HI>increas'd</HI> or <HI>continued.</HI> His <HI>Happiness,</HI> Joy or Complacency may be the Subject of our <HI>pleasing</HI> Contemplation; but cannot be the Object of our <HI>Volition,</HI> Desire or Endeavour. The Sup∣position that his Happiness can be any ways <HI>con∣sequent</HI> upon our <HI>Volition</HI> or Endeavour, destroys the proper Idea of it. Indeed the <HI>declarative</HI> Glory of God consists in some external Opera∣tions or Manifestations to the Creature, in which we may be, in some measure, <HI>active</HI> or instru∣mental; but the Happiness of God is an internal State <HI>within himself;</HI> to which we can have no Relation, but only by a pleasing Perception or Contemplation.</P>
<P>But tho' it is so difficult to form any Idea of Benevolence to God; yet Bp. <HI>Cumberland</HI> makes it to be the <Q><HI>whole</HI> of Piety towards God; <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chap. I. Sec. 4.</NOTE> and the Sum of the Duties of the first Table of the Law: which he says consist in a Sense or Conviction, that it is for the In∣terest of all, that God should be the supreme

Governor of the World, for the common Good and the Happiness of each of us in particular.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chap. IX.

Sec. 24.</NOTE></Q> By which he seems evidently to mean, that our Be∣nevolence to God has a peculiar Reference to him as the <HI>Governor</HI> of the World; and is a Wish or Desire that he might <HI>govern well,</HI> with Wisdom, Honour, and Success, for the com∣mon Happiness, and my own in particular: and in order to secure his Favour, should endeavour to make myself <HI>acceptable to him.</HI> So that this Benevolence towards <HI>God,</HI> seems ultimately to terminate only in Benevolence towards <HI>ourselves;</HI> or in a wishing well to those Ways and Means which are necessary to promote my <HI>own</HI> Happi∣ness in Conjunction with the Happiness of <HI>others.</HI> But this whole Scheme of the <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> advanced by Bp. <HI>Cumberland,</HI> is fully and clearly confuted by fourteen Arguments in the Appen∣dix to Mr. <HI>Maxwell</HI>'s English Translation of it.</P>
<P N="34">§ 34. Another Criterion of moral Vir∣tue and Obligation, is moral <HI>Taste</HI> and <HI>Sense.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hutcheson</HI> on Virtue, &amp;c. passim.</NOTE> They say, that <Q>when any Man sees or con∣siders any Action, he immediately <HI>approves</HI> or <HI>disapproves</HI> of it, by Virtue of an <HI>internal Taste</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="009931_0026_0F7B3B9AC7EE4DD0"/>
or <HI>Sense,</HI> which he <HI>naturally</HI> has in himself; just as Things are agreeable or disagreeable to his <HI>natural Taste.</HI></Q> That <Q>this his Taste or Sense is the sole Criterion of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> and the Standard of moral <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil.</HI></Q> And that <Q>the only <HI>Obligation</HI> he can be under, is to conform to the inward Sense of his own Mind; at least, that is the <HI>next</HI> and <HI>immediate</HI> Rule to him.</Q> Upon which I would observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. That so far as such a <HI>Sense</HI> or Disposition of judging of what is right and wrong, exists in the Mind of a meer <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>uninlightened</HI> Man, it proceeds wholly from a Principle of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> improved in the Manner I before re∣lated; whereby, from <HI>general Observation,</HI> he fixes upon certain general <HI>Rules</HI> or Methods of Conduct among Mankind, which he apprehends will be most conducive to the <HI>general Good</HI> and his <HI>own</HI> Happiness in particular; and thereupon contracts a <HI>Habit</HI> of judging upon particular Ac∣tions, as being <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong,</HI> upon a <HI>Sudden,</HI> without particularly considering the Reasons, upon which such a Judgment was <HI>originally</HI> founded. And this <HI>Sense</HI> or Judgment is <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong</HI> according to the original <HI>Rules</HI> of Con∣duct he happen'd to fix upon. Some indeed make this moral Sense to be nearly the same with <HI>Conscience.</HI> But Conscience is the <HI>Judg∣ment</HI> which a Man forms of his own Actions, as being <HI>agreable</HI> or <HI>disagreable</HI> to the <HI>Law</HI> of God: but where no divine Law is supposed (un∣less it be that a man ought to make the <HI>Sense</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="009931_0027_0F7B3B9B9EA45088"/>
of his own Mind, the <HI>Rule</HI> of his Conduct) then his <HI>Sense</HI> and Taste is the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>only Stan∣dard</HI> of judging (as it is in bitter and sweet) and so there can be no Room or Place for the Exer∣cise of Conscience; unless it be in judging whe∣ther a Man's Actions are agreable to his Judg∣ment.</P>
<P N="35">§ 35. (2) Altho', when Man was at first created in the <HI>divine Image,</HI> he had a pleasing <HI>Taste, Sense</HI> and <HI>Approbation</HI> of every Thing which is agreable to the divine Perfections, yet, since the <HI>Fall,</HI> his Understanding is <HI>darkened,</HI> his Judgment is <HI>perverted,</HI> his Taste and Relish of Things <HI>corrupted,</HI> and his <HI>Mind,</HI> and <HI>Conscience is defiled;</HI> as we are fully taught by divine Re∣velation, Rom. iii. 9. &amp;c. <HI>Both Jews and Gen∣tiles are all under Sin.

<HI>Locke.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>On Human Understanding,</HI> Book I. Chap.

And if this moral Taste be the Criterion of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong;</HI> then <HI>every</HI> Man's Taste is the <HI>Rule to himself;</HI> and there may be as many <HI>different</HI> Rules of Virtue and Vice, as there are vitiated Tastes among Mankind. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hutcheson</HI> wrote a∣gainst one another, and plainly confuted <HI>each others</HI> Principles, although they could not establish their <HI>own.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="36">§ 36. Another more plausible Standard of <HI>moral Virtue</HI> and <HI>Obligation,</HI> is <HI>Reason.</HI> Many Authors talk much of <HI>Reason,</HI> as if it was an <HI>infallible</HI> Guide; but do not sufficiently distin∣guish the <HI>different Senses</HI> in which that Word is used; sometimes to denote the rational <HI>Objects</HI> perceived, and sometimes the <HI>perceiving Power</HI> of the Mind.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Objective Reason</HI> signifies the OBJECTS perceived by our Minds; such as God, his Per∣fections, Ideas and Works, as participating of some Degree of his Perfections; together with
<PB N="26" REF="009931_0029_0F7B3B9CCD69C6E0"/>
all the various Modes and Relations of these Things one to another. All <HI>just</HI> Conceptions and <HI>true Propositions</HI> concerning any of these Things, are called <HI>Reason</HI> in the Object. As if I lay down these Propositions, that <HI>Every self-existent Being is eternal and immutable.</HI> That <HI>God is to be worshiped and obeyed by his Creatures.</HI> Most Men will say that these Propositions are REASON, or agreable to <HI>Reason.</HI> Now <HI>Reason,</HI> taken in this Sense, according to Mr. <HI>Norris,</HI> signifies the <HI>Divine Ideas,</HI> or God's Conceptions of his own Perfections, as they are in them∣selves, or as they are exhibited in his Works; and may, in some Respect, be said to be <HI>God himself,</HI> as conceived of by himself. And so far as the Divine Ideas are, in any Way or De∣gree communicated to <HI>us,</HI> and are the Objects of <HI>our</HI> Conception; <HI>our Reason</HI> seems to be an E∣manation from and Part of the infinite <HI>Intelli∣gence</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God, <HI>replenishing</HI> and <HI>il∣luminating</HI> our Minds. Reason, in this Sense, is an <HI>infallible Guide,</HI> and comes near to the Standard I have before laid down. But I sup∣pose this is not the Meaning of those Authors who set up the <HI>Oracles</HI> of human Reason, Oppo∣sition to divine Revelation.</P>
<P N="37">§ 37 (2) <HI>Subjective Reason</HI> has <HI>Man</HI> for the <HI>Subject,</HI> and signifies a <HI>Power in the human Mind,</HI> whereby a Man is able, in some Measure, to conceive of the Objects before mentioned, and to draw necessary Inferences and Deductions from them, both of a speculative and practical Nature.
<PB N="27" REF="009931_0030_0F7B3B9DADC2A920"/>
Now Reason, considered as a <HI>Power</HI> or Faculty in Man, though it is a very great and noble En∣dowment, vastly superior to the <HI>brutal Instinct,</HI> yet it is subject to many <HI>Imperfections</HI> and Lim∣itations, and, in this fallen State, to many De∣lusions and pernicious Errors. And this arises partly from wrong Conceptions of the Objects, and partly from wrong Deductions from our own Conceptions. For in order to reason right, we must have not only just and <HI>clear Conceptions</HI> of the Objects reasoned upon (at least so far as as we pretend to reason upon them) but clear Perceptions of the <HI>Relation</HI> of our own Ideas, in order to draw just Inferences and Deductions from them.</P>
<P N="38">§ 38. Reason if tolerably well capable of un∣derstanding the Principles of <HI>Self-Interest,</HI> and the necessary Means of promoting the Happiness of Mankind in their private and political Capa∣city. From hence proceeded the just and ra∣tional Institutes of the <HI>Civil Law</HI> among the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> which were so well calculated to promote their publick Peace and natural Hap∣piness. Yet even in these Things, Reason is but an imperfect Guide; for in some Countries many evident <HI>Vices, plainly</HI> detrimental to the natural Happiness of Mankind, were <HI>allowed</HI> by the <HI>publick</HI> Laws. But then Reason goes but a very <HI>little</HI> Way in determining the Principles of human Actions, considered as <HI>moral, religious,</HI> or <HI>acceptable</HI> to God, or relative to the future Happiness; unless a Man reasons upon the <HI>Data</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="009931_0031_0F7B3B9E52E28C88"/>
of divine Revelation. Indeed Revelation sup∣poses Man to be a <HI>rational Creature,</HI> capable of understanding the Propositions designed to be communicated to him, of <HI>comparing</HI> one with another, and of forming a <HI>consistent Scheme</HI> of the whole. But then there must be some <HI>Data</HI> or <HI>first</HI> moral Principles given by God himself, for human Reason to act and build upon, or otherwise he has no <HI>sure</HI> Foundation for any just Inferences and Deductions. Thus if a Man sets out upon this Principle, that his <HI>own</HI> Happiness is the sole and ultimate End of <HI>his</HI> Creation; or that a Conformity to his own Sense and Taste of Things, is the <HI>only</HI> Thing necessary to procure the divine Favour and eternal Happiness, how justly soever he may reason upon these Princi∣ples, yet if they prove to be false, the whole Superstructure will <HI>fail</HI> him.</P>
<P N="39">§ 39. Besides, Reason considered as a meer <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Faculty</HI> in Man, cannot possibly be the Criterion of Virtue, or the <HI>original</HI> Standard to which human Actions <HI>ought</HI> to be conformed; since it is only a <HI>Power in us</HI> to <HI>find out</HI> and know what that Standard is, and the <HI>Measure</HI> by which we try the Conformity of our own Actions to that Standard; as a Scale or Pole is the Measure by which we determine the Con∣formity of an Edifice to the Plan laid by the Architect. Reason therefore, considered as a Power in <HI>us,</HI> supposes a <HI>superior</HI> Standard by which our Actions are to be <HI>tried;</HI> which is the
<PB N="29" REF="009931_0032_0F7B3B9F0B35A4E8"/>
moral Perfections or Law of God, to which our Actions ought to be conformed.</P>
<P N="40">§ 40. Furthermore; Reason, considered as a meer human Power or Qualification can never have such a transcendent Excellency and Digni∣ty, as to be the Criterion of the divine Favour, Approbation and eternal Felicity, or claim such a <HI>supreme Authority</HI> and Empire, as to be the Foundation of all moral Obligation; for this would make Man, or one of his own Faculties to be his supreme Law-giver and Governor. And it is plainly contrary to the clearest Dictates of Reason we are Masters of, to deny this su∣preme Dignity and Authority to the infinite <HI>Per∣fections of God,</HI> and yet to give it to such a sub∣ordinate, limited and imperfect Thing as <HI>human Reason,</HI> I say not this to depreciate or <HI>decry</HI> human Reason, but to allow its just Excellency and Dignity, without making of it to interfere with the eternal, immutable, and absolute Per∣fections of the <HI>all-perfect God.</HI></P>
<P N="41">§ 41. Besides, human Reason, without evi∣dent Data or Principles to proceed upon, especi∣ally under Prepossessions and wrong Inclinations, is very <HI>various</HI> in its Dictates; so that what ap∣pears to be reasonable to <HI>one</HI> Person or Nation, appears to be utterly unreasonable to <HI>another;</HI> and that even in some of the plainest Instances of Virtue and Vice, which one would think might be better regulated even by the Principles of Self-Interest and Happiness.</P>
<P N="42">§ 42. Lastly, Reason is of such a <HI>general</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="009931_0033_0F7B3B9FC2DE1D98"/>
Nature, as that it cannot be the special Criterion of moral Virtue and Obligation; for if so, then every Thought, Word or Action in Mathema∣ticks, Law, Mechanicks or Agriculture, which is agreable to Reason, would be a moral Virtue; which I think no Man ever yet asserted. There must therefore be some Criterion or Rule to de∣termine moral Virtue and Obligation, which is more particular and precise than the general Idea of human Reason.</P>
<P N="43">§ 43. Some confound Reason with <HI>Conscience,</HI> and say that God has implanted in every Man a natural Conscience, whereby he is able, with his own Reason, to know what is right and wrong, and the Will of God, and to act accordingly. Now, <Q>Conscience is the Judgment which a Man forms concerning his own Actions, as agreable or disagreable to the Law and Will of God:</Q> and this ultimately resolves the Rule into the <HI>divine Law;</HI> and as the divine Law results from the divine Nature and Perfections, this Rule is so far right, and the same which I have before laid down. But then Reason is not the Law it∣self, but only the Means to find out the Law. And Conscience is not the Law itself, but only his Judgment upon the Law; which Judgment is sometimes right and sometimes wrong: which plainly supposes an antecedent <HI>superior Standard.</HI></P>

<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 191.</NOTE></Q> But have the Gentlemen who talk thus, any clear Ideas of what they mean by <HI>these</HI> THINGS, whose Nature or Pro∣perties are necessary, eternal and immutable? Where are these <HI>Things</HI> to be found? Are they Creatures? or, Are they the eternal Creator? If by these <HI>Things</HI> they mean the divine Nature, Perfections, or Ideas; and if, by the <HI>Fitnesses</HI> of Things, they mean the Unity, Harmony or Congruity of the divine Nature, Perfections, or Ideas; or our <HI>just</HI> Conceptions of them, then they mean something that is <HI>real;</HI> and I readily allow that these <HI>Things,</HI> or Objects of Conception, are necessary, eternal and immutable; and that the Will and Actions of God are necessarily de∣termined by his <HI>own Perfections;</HI> and that a Conformity to them, is the Foundation of all moral Obligation in Men. But to suppose that God's Will should be necessarily determined by any Thing, even by abstract <HI>Justice, Goodness,</HI> or <HI>Truth,</HI> considered not as his own Perfections, but as <HI>Things out of, distinct from,</HI> or <HI>independent of</HI> himself, is highly <HI>absurd.</HI> For this is, in Effect, to suppose the Existence of <HI>other</HI> Beings, necessarily and eternally existing, which are <HI>su∣perior to him,</HI> and to which he is <HI>bound</HI> to be conformed as the Measure and Standard of his Perfection. Or if by these <HI>Things</HI> are meant the Creatures, or any Actions or Properties in
<PB N="33" REF="009931_0036_0F7B3BA43258DAE0"/>
them or resulting from them, or any <HI>Entia Ra∣tionis</HI> or Creatures of Imagination; then these temporary or fleeting Things can have no eter∣nal or immutable Existence, Relation or Fitnes∣ses, or any such supreme Excellency or <HI>Authority,</HI> so as to be the Foundation of all <HI>moral Obligation</HI> either in God or Man.</P>
<P N="45">§ 45. VI. Another supposed Foundation of moral Virtue and Obligation, is a <HI>Conformity to Truth.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wollaston</HI> says, that <Q>we ought to <HI>treat</HI> every Thing as being <HI>what it is.</HI></Q> That <Q>we ought to <HI>conduct</HI> towards every Person and Thing in all the Relations it stands in to us and other Things, as being what in <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Fact</HI> it is.</Q> That <Q>these Relations may be expressed in many true Propositions, which may be affirmed and denied by <HI>Actions</HI> as well as <HI>Words:</HI></Q> that <Q>every Action which implies the Truth of any true Proposition is <HI>morally right:</HI></Q> and that every Action which implies <Q>the <HI>Denial</HI> of any true Proposition is morally <HI>wrong.</HI></Q> And that <Q>the Virtue or Viciousness of any Action consists <HI>wholly</HI> in this, that it is an <HI>Affirmation</HI> or <HI>Denial</HI> of some true Propo∣sition.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Religion of Nature, Sec. 1. passim.</NOTE></Q> Now if Truth is taken essentially for one of the moral <HI>Perfections of God,</HI> then a Conformity to this Perfection, in our Temper and Actions, is so far <HI>right,</HI> and agreable to the Rule I have before laid down. But if <HI>Truth</HI> be taken in a general and <HI>metaphysical</HI> Sense, to sig∣nify
<PB N="34" REF="009931_0037_0F7B3BA4495D9D10"/>
only the Truth of <HI>Facts,</HI> and the <HI>natural</HI> Relation of Things, I think the <HI>Morality</HI> of any Action cannot be determined by it. For all Facts may be <HI>conceded</HI> as true and brought into a Proposition, and yet the Question of <HI>Right</HI> and Obligation, may still be as undetermined as ever. As, what <HI>Obligation</HI> am I under to act or not act in such a Case? What Actions are the <HI>De∣nial</HI> of such a Proposition? and what is the Crime of <HI>denying</HI> a true Proposition in Actions, or even in <HI>Words,</HI> upon a Supposition that there is no <HI>moral Law</HI> antecedently existing which <HI>forbids</HI> such a Denial?</P>
<P N="46">§ 46. As suppose I am <HI>poor</HI> and needy and my Neighbour is <HI>rich</HI> and has more than he is likely to want, may I not privately <HI>take</HI> and <HI>use</HI> some of his Goods?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> says, if you take and <HI>use</HI> your Neighbour's Goods, you treat them as being your <HI>own,</HI> and practically <HI>declare</HI> that they are your <HI>own;</HI> when in Truth they are <HI>not:</HI> and you practically <HI>deny</HI> the Truth of this Proposition, that they are your Neighbour's; and so you are guilty of <HI>Lying.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> replies No; for I have a <HI>Right</HI> to take and use my Neighbour's Goods, under these Circumstances; and my using them is no De∣claration that they are <HI>mine,</HI> or that they are not <HI>his.</HI> Here all the Facts are <HI>conceded,</HI> as in Truth they are; and yet the <HI>Right</HI> remains undecided, and will remain so until it is decided by some <HI>moral Law</HI> or Rule which results from the di∣vince <HI>Justice</HI> or <HI>Truth,</HI> viz. That every Man
<PB N="35" REF="009931_0038_0F7B3BA504F83780"/>
<HI>ought</HI> to have the <HI>sole</HI> Use of his OWN; or, that it is <HI>unjust</HI> to use another's Property without his <HI>Consent.</HI></P>
<P N="47">§ 47. And supposing that all Vices are to be resolved into <HI>Lying;</HI> by what Rule does it ap∣pear, that Lying is a <HI>moral</HI> Evil?</P>
<P><HI>Wollaston</HI> says 'because it is a Denial of <HI>Facts</HI> that are <HI>true.</HI>' But there is <HI>no Crime</HI> in that, if there be <HI>no antecedent</HI> moral Obligation <HI>not</HI> to deny them. Therefore, to lay it down, as a <HI>first</HI> Principle, that we are obliged to keep to historical Truth, is to lay that down as a <HI>first</HI> Principle, which needs a <HI>preceding</HI> one to sup∣port it. And therefore it is ultimately to be re∣solved into this fundamental Principle, that we are <HI>obliged</HI> to be conformed to the eternal and immutable <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> of God. Without this, a Conformity to the Truth of <HI>Facts</HI> or <HI>historical Truth,</HI> can only be a <HI>natural Conveni∣ency,</HI> at most; but has Nothing in it of the Nature of <HI>moral Virtue</HI> or Obligation.</P>
<P N="48">§ 48. VII. Another supposed Standard of moral Virtue and Obligation, is <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong.</HI> That whatsoever is morally <HI>right,</HI> is a moral Virtue; and whatsoever is morally <HI>wrong,</HI> is a Vice. That the highest Obligation of every moral Agent (whether God or Man) is to be conformed to that which is <HI>right,</HI> and to abstain from that which is <HI>wrong.</HI> That every Man naturally has in his own Mind the Idea of Right, and by this, as the ultimate Standard, he judges
<PB N="36" REF="009931_0039_0F7B3BA5CC747230"/>
of all Beings and Actions, beyond which there is a <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> To which I reply,</P>
<P N="49">§ 49. (1.) That the Idea of <HI>Right</HI> plainly contains these three distinct Ideas;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Idea of a <HI>Rule</HI> or Standard, to which any Action or Thing ought to be confor∣med, in order to its being denominated <HI>Right.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Idea of the Thing that is con∣formed to the Standard.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Idea of the Relation of these two Objects, that the latter is conformed to the former.</P>
<P>If the Mind sees a <HI>Conformity</HI> of the Action or Thing to its Standard, then it judges it to be <HI>right;</HI> and if it sees a Non-conformity, then it judges it to be <HI>wrong.</HI> Therefore the Idea of Right, cannot be the Idea of the Standard itself, but is an Idea <HI>subsequent to</HI> and consequent upon it; and plainly presupposes a <HI>superior</HI> Standard to which the Thing ought to be <HI>conformed</HI> in order to its being denominated <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P N="50">§ 50. (2.) This Principle sets up a Thing which is <HI>not</HI> God, to be a Standard for <HI>God;</HI> a Rule to <HI>try</HI> him by, and to which he ought to be conformed. Which is to suppose a Being or Thing antecedent to the <HI>first,</HI> and higher than the highest; which is manifestly absurd. In∣deed by observing various Instances of the Con∣formity of Things to their Standard, a Man may get a general <HI>abstract</HI> Idea of <HI>Right,</HI> before he has the Idea of God; but then, if he traces back his own Ideas to the <HI>first</HI> Source, he
<PB N="37" REF="009931_0040_0F7B3BA6F2AACF58"/>
must recur to one eternal and <HI>self-existent</HI> Being who is the Original and Foundation of all Per∣fection and <HI>Standard</HI> of all that is right—Here he comes to a <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> and not before. And to set up any Thing which is not God, as being <HI>eternal,</HI> immutable and independent, is to set up <HI>another</HI> God, with some of his essential Pro∣perties, and as a Standard <HI>superior</HI> to him.</P>
<P N="51">§ 51. (3.) The general, abstract Idea of <HI>Right,</HI> being a Conformity of a Thing to its <HI>Standard,</HI> there will be as <HI>many and various</HI> Ideas of Right, as there are <HI>Standards</HI> of Conformity. Thus a <HI>right Line</HI> is made by a strait Rule or Scale. A Traveller takes the <HI>right Way,</HI> when he takes that which will bring him <HI>quickest</HI> or <HI>easiest</HI> to the Place designed: that being the <HI>Standard of Right</HI> in his Mind. A natural Man, when he does that which he conceives to be most for his <HI>own Interest</HI> and Happiness (which is his ulti∣mate End) does what he conceives to be <HI>right:</HI> and a Man acting under the Direction of divine <HI>Revelation,</HI> makes a Conformity to the <HI>divine</HI> Nature and Perfections to be his Rule and Stan∣dard of <HI>Right.</HI> And every Man conceives that to be <HI>wrong,</HI> which is a Non-conformity to the Standard he fixes upon, let it be <HI>what it will.</HI> But if it could be supposed that a Man has <HI>no Standard</HI> of Right in his own Mind, then the Idea of <HI>Right</HI> itself immediately vanishes; for there can be no <HI>relative</HI> Ideas where there is no Conception of the Subjects from whence those Relations result. Indeed, if by Right is meant
<PB N="38" REF="009931_0041_0F7B3BA762D4C368"/>
the divine Perfections, especially God's Justice and Truth, or a Conformity to them, as the original Standard; this is the same Criterion I have before laid down. But if by Right is meant any <HI>Entity</HI> or Relation <HI>necessarily</HI> existing <HI>out of</HI> God, not derived <HI>from</HI> him or dependent <HI>upon</HI> him, and to which <HI>he</HI> is obliged to be con∣formed, as the Standard of <HI>his</HI> Perfection; such a Conception is a <HI>meer Imagination,</HI> and is, in Effect, a setting up of <HI>another</HI> God not only <HI>besides</HI> him, but <HI>above</HI> him; which is so far from being the Foundation of <HI>true</HI> Religion and Morality, that it seems to be a Kind of <HI>Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P N="52">§ 52. VIII. The last supposed Foundation of moral Virtue and Obligation, which I shall mention, is <HI>Obedience to the Will and Commands</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> with this <HI>ultimate View,</HI> to obtain his Favour and Rewards, and thereby to <HI>promote my own Happiness.</HI> This is the same Principle I mentioned before; but only Obedience to God is here proposed as a <HI>subordinate Means</HI> to promote Self-Interest, <HI>as an ultimate End.</HI> But I con∣ceive that the Nature of an <HI>ultimate</HI> End is not at all altered or made better, by the Goodness of the subordinate <HI>Means</HI> proposed in order to ob∣tain it. Although I am never so careful to do that which is agreable to the divine Law, yet, upon this Principle, I regard God only as he is <HI>subservient</HI> to me; for if I obey him upon no other Motive but only <HI>the expected Wages,</HI> I view him only as a Servant to me. And though I
<PB N="39" REF="009931_0042_0F7B3BA8F8E72B50"/>
should suppose, that he has an infinitely <HI>better</HI> Disposition and <HI>greater</HI> Capacity to reward and happify me, than all <HI>other</HI> Beings, and so should value his Favour <HI>above</HI> all the World <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, yet still this does not alter the Nature of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; I still esteem and value him only <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>best</HI> of Servants, or as a Being most subservient to my <HI>own Interest.</HI></P>
<P N="53">§ 53. Upon this Principle, the Obedience paid to <HI>God,</HI> is of the same Nature and Kind with that which is paid to an earthly <HI>King.</HI> We regard the King or supreme Magistrate, as such, only as he is subservient to the Good of the Community and my Good in particular; and if we believe that he has the best Disposition and Capacity to promote these Ends, of any Man that we know of, this is the highest Regard we can ordinarily have for an earthly King, as such. But there is an infinitely different Kind of Re∣gard to be paid to God upon the Account of his own <HI>intrinsic</HI> Excellencies, and Perfections, <HI>an∣tecedent</HI> to the Consideration of his being our Creator, Benefactor or Governor. And if we do not serve God from an infinitely <HI>better</HI> Prin∣ciple than we serve an earthly <HI>King,</HI> there is no Probability that ever we shall obtain the Reward of <HI>eternal Happiness.</HI></P>
<P N="54">§. 54. Some other Authors have laid down <HI>other</HI> Foundations of moral <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Obligation;</HI> but it will be needless to mention any more; since whatever fundamental Principles Men may build upon, considered as <HI>distinct from</HI> and <HI>in∣dependent</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="009931_0043_0F7B3BA995AF1620"/>
of the one <HI>self-existent, eternal, immu∣table</HI> and <HI>all-perfect</HI> Being, they will, upon Ex∣amination, be found to have no <HI>real, permanent</HI> and <HI>stable</HI> Foundation at all.</P>
<P N="55">§ 55. Finally, some Treatises on <HI>Ethics</HI> seem to build upon almost all these <HI>several</HI> Founda∣tions, confusedly <HI>mixed</HI> together, without any Distinction of their Nature, Order and Relation; which leave the Mind <HI>confused,</HI> and unsettled upon any real Foundation at all. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grove</HI>'s Ethicks.</NOTE> But so far as these <HI>latter</HI> Principles may, in <HI>any Sense,</HI> be admitted, it is in the following Order and Re∣lation, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The divine Perfections are the <HI>primary,</HI> the <HI>ultimate</HI> and <HI>sole</HI> Foundation and Standard of all moral Virtue and Obligation.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Law or Will of God is the <HI>next</HI> and <HI>immediate</HI> Rule to us, as it declares what these Perfections are; and what Temper and Conduct in us, is a Conformity to them. Which also creates <HI>an additional</HI> Obligation, as he is our sovereign Lord and Proprietor.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Reason</HI> is a Power or Faculty in us whereby we are, in some Measure, able to <HI>understand</HI> this Law, compare our Temper and Actions with it, and judge of their Conformity to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. By a <HI>Course</HI> of reasoning and <HI>judging</HI> upon any Law or Rule, we acquire a <HI>Habit</HI> of judg∣ing on a <HI>sudden,</HI> in particular Cases, without <HI>distinctly</HI> recollecting the Principles or Reasons upon which we formerly judged. If this be all
<PB N="41" REF="009931_0044_0F7B3BAB81261140"/>
that is meant by <HI>moral Sense, Taste</HI> or <HI>Instinct,</HI> it may be conceded.</P>
<P N="5">5. The greater Part of Mankind are, in <HI>Fact,</HI> governed by a meer natural Principle of <HI>Self-Love;</HI> and a Regard to the <HI>public</HI> Good, so far as they <HI>conceive</HI> their <HI>own</HI> Interest and Happiness to be involved in it. And in those who are en∣dowed with a <HI>higher</HI> Principle, Self-Interest may be an <HI>additional</HI> Stimulus or Incitement to do that which was an <HI>antecedent</HI> Duty.</P>
<P N="56">§ 56. Having shewn that the <HI>moral Perfec∣tions</HI> of God are the <HI>sole</HI> Criterion and Standard of all <HI>Perfection</HI> and <HI>Obligation</HI> in the Creature; and the Insufficiency of all <HI>other</HI> Foundations; I proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To shew, That divine Revelation, is the <HI>only</HI> Way and Means whereby we can <HI>know</HI> what the Perfections of God are, and what <HI>Dis∣positions</HI> and <HI>Conduct in us,</HI> are a Conformity to these Perfections. I suppose that the Angels and glorified Saints in Heaven, by their own Reason, could not so perfectly find out the <HI>Per∣fections</HI> and <HI>Will</HI> of God, but that there is a Necessity of some particular <HI>Revelations</HI> and Di∣rections: And that <HI>Adam,</HI> in a State of Inno∣cency, could not, by his own <HI>natural Reason,</HI> know what Use he might make of all the Trees in the Garden: and therefore God told him, <HI>that of every Tree of the Garden he might freely eat;</HI> but of the <HI>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he might not eat, nor so much as touch it.</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="009931_0045_0F7B3BAC39C86F48"/>
It is certain that Man, in his <HI>fallen</HI> and <HI>dar∣kened</HI> State, stands in Need of divine Revelation to instruct him in the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Perfections</HI> of God, to teach him his <HI>Duty,</HI> and how to ob∣tain a <HI>Restoration</HI> to the divine Favour.</P>
<P N="57">§ 57. It is highly <HI>probable,</HI> if not <HI>certain,</HI> that all that imperfect <HI>Knowledge</HI> which the <HI>Heathens</HI> had of the Nature and Will of God, they received by Tradition from <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Revelations made to the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets; and especially from the Writings of <HI>Moses. Plato</HI> says, that <Q>all Laws came ori∣ginally from divine Revelation: <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De Legibus.</NOTE></Q> And that <Q>Virtue is not by Nature or Instruction, but by a divine Gift. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dialog. <HI>Meno.</HI></NOTE></Q> Mr. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> in his <HI>Reasonableness of Christianity,</HI> says, that <Q>whatsoever there is of Excellency in the Phi∣losophy of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> is owing to Revela∣tion, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. P. 256.</NOTE></Q> <HI>Clemens,</HI> President of the College in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> A.

<PB N="43" REF="009931_0046_0F7B3BAC8629A300"/>
into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thereupon to rectify the <HI>Egyp∣tian</HI> Theology in several Things. <HI>Sanchoniathon,</HI> the <HI>Phaenician,</HI> who, in the Time of the Judges, wrote a History of the World, says he took the principal Parts of it from the Writing of <HI>Jerub∣baal, Priest of Jehovah,</HI> or (as it is expressed in <HI>Greek) Hierumbal, Priest of Jeuo.</HI> The <HI>mosaic</HI> Writings were spread far and wide in the ex∣tensive Reign of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> and in the <HI>Ba∣bylonish</HI> Captivity; and were probably carried, by the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> to the <HI>uttermost Parts of the Earth.</HI> Some devout <HI>Jews</HI> dwelt <HI>in every Nation under Heaven,</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 5.</NOTE> who, doubtless, car∣ried the old Testament with them. <HI>Daniel,</HI> who was Master of the wise Men of <HI>Babylon,</HI> taught the Knowledge of the <HI>true</HI> God; and gave such Demonstrations of his Perfections, as that <HI>Nebuchadnazar</HI> and <HI>Darius</HI> commanded <HI>all</HI> Nations, People and Languages to serve the God of <HI>Daniel,</HI> upon the severest Penalties, <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dan. iv. 29, &amp; vi. 26.</NOTE> And that they might the better <HI>know</HI> who this God was, and <HI>how</HI> to serve him; it is probable that <HI>Daniel</HI> made or procured the <HI>Greek</HI> Trans∣lation, spoken of by <HI>Aristobulus</HI> a famous <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and Peripatetic Philosopher, men∣tioned in the second Book of <HI>Maccabees,</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">B. ii.

<PB N="44" REF="009931_0047_0F7B3BAD41371C88"/>
their <HI>principal Sentiments</HI> out of them; and, in many Instances, transcribed the very Words. <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Euseb. Praeparat. Evangel. Lib. xiii.

Most of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Moralists wrote <HI>after</HI> that Translation was made; and the <HI>best</HI> of them, after the Publication of <HI>Christianity.</HI> So that the Supposition which many have made, that <Q>whatever the <HI>Heathen</HI> Philosophers, in <HI>Fact</HI> knew, they knew by the <HI>meer</HI> Light of Nature, without any Help from divine <HI>Reve∣lation,</HI></Q> has not the <HI>least</HI> Foundation: and I cannot easily conceive how any Gentleman of Reading could fall into such a Mistake. And indeed it is impossible to know what the <HI>meer</HI> Light of Nature could have found out, in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> unless we could find some Person or People, who were so <HI>separated</HI> from the Rest of the World, as that we could be sure they received Nothing from <HI>Tradition</HI> or <HI>divine</HI> Revelation.</P>
<P N="58">§ 58. It is certain that the ancient <HI>Babylonians, Egyptians,</HI> &amp;c. had some clear Knowledge of the Creation, the primitive State of Happiness, and especially of the Flood; which historical <HI>Facts</HI> they could not know, but by Tradition or Revelation. And so far as the Knowledge of these historical Facts grew <HI>faint,</HI> or was <HI>dis∣guised by Fables;</HI> so far the Knowledge of the divine Perfections and moral Duties <HI>failed</HI> with

it; insomuch that several of the remoter Nations, as the <HI>Hottentots</HI> and the Inhabitants of <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI> had NO <HI>Idea of God at all,</HI> until it was, of late Years, communicated to them by the <HI>Europeans;</HI> as is evident from sundry Authori∣ties quoted by Mr. <HI>Locke on human Understand∣ing,</HI> Book I.

<P N="59">§ 59. I was well acquainted with a <HI>Negro,</HI> who was a Man of superior <HI>natural Powers</HI> and made a Profession of Religion, who told me that he was born in the Island of <HI>Madagascar</HI> and lived there till he was above thirty-four Years old; and in all that Time never had a Thought of the Being of a <HI>God,</HI> a <HI>Creator,</HI> or <HI>Governor</HI> of the World, or a <HI>future</HI> State after Death. Dr. <HI>Williots,</HI> in his Sermon on the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> relates a Story of a Man in <HI>France,</HI> who was born <HI>deaf</HI> and dumb, yet was very know∣ing, active and faithful in the common Affairs of Life: and, upon a solemn Trial before the Bishop, by the Help of those who could con∣verse with him by Signs, was judged to be a <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>devout</HI> Christian, and admitted to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which he attended for many Years, with all the Signs of high Devotion, such as Elevation of the Hands, Eyes, &amp;c.: at length a large Quantity of hard Wax was taken out of his Ears; upon which he could hear; and, after a While, could speak and read. He then declared, that <Q>while he was deaf, he had <HI>no Idea</HI> of a God, or Ma∣ker of the World, or of a future State;</Q> and
<PB N="46" REF="009931_0049_0F7B3BB00DB162E8"/>
that <Q>all he then did, in Matters of Religion, was <HI>purely in Imitation of Others.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="60">§ 60. It is <HI>possible</HI> that a Man, by contem∣plating his <HI>own Ideas,</HI> the visible Works of <HI>Crea∣tion,</HI> and the Course of <HI>Causes</HI> and <HI>Effects,</HI> might, by Degrees, <HI>find out</HI> the Being and Perfections of God; but it is <HI>probable</HI> that he might live many Years, perhaps his whole <HI>Life,</HI> before his Thoughts would take much of a <HI>Turn</HI> upon these <HI>invisible</HI> and <HI>metaphysical</HI> Objects. But after these Things were suggested to him by <HI>Others,</HI> and he was set in <HI>earnest</HI> to reason upon them, he would find the most <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>undoubt∣ed</HI> Evidence of a <HI>self-existent</HI> and <HI>eternal Being.</HI> For there is a plain Distinction between a Man's <HI>seeing the Evidence</HI> of a Proposition, when it is fairly <HI>proposed</HI> to him by <HI>another,</HI> and his find∣ing it out of <HI>himself,</HI> or suggesting it to his own Mind. Thus there are many important Truths in natural Philosophy and Mathematics, which, when they come to be fairly <HI>proposed,</HI> were never <HI>doubted</HI> of; such as the general Laws of Attrac∣tion, the Weight of the Atmosphere, Rules of Fluxions, &amp;c. and yet it is probable that these Things never came into the Mind of any Mortal, till they were suggested by the great Genius of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton.</HI> Yea, there are some plain Truths, very useful to Mankind, in Surveying, Navigation, &amp;c. such as that <HI>The three Angles of a Triangle are equal to two right ones;</HI> which probably never entered into the Mind of one Man in an Hundred, either by his <HI>own</HI> Sug∣gestion, or by the Instruction of <HI>Others.</HI></P>

As it is doubtful <HI>how far</HI> Men would have found out the Being and Perfections of God, if there never had been <HI>any Kind of Reve∣lation;</HI> so it is more doubtful how far they would have found out <HI>moral Duties;</HI> any further than Experience would have taught them sundry Rules how to promote <HI>Self-Interest,</HI> and the com∣mon Happiness of the Community. Authors frequently speak of the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> as the great <HI>fundamental</HI> Principle of all <HI>moral</HI> Duties; and yet they give very different, if not contrary Definitions of it. The most ancient and most generally received Definition, is that in the <HI>Jus Civile.</HI> viz. <HI>Jus naturale est quod Natura omnia Animalia docuit.</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Justiniani Institut.

And yet it seems a great <HI>Impro∣priety</HI> in Language and in Thought, to <HI>feign</HI> Nature to be a <HI>Person,</HI> vested with a <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> to institute a Law for all Mankind;
<PB N="48" REF="009931_0051_0F7B3BB149A55088"/>
and tends to mislead the Mind. And yet he says, in another Place, <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Pag. 163.</NOTE> that <Q>the Law of ;Nature is precisely the same with the <HI>divine moral</HI> Law, limited to those Things which are noticed by the <HI>Light</HI> of Nature.</Q> But what those Things are, no Man has ever yet pretend∣ed to determine with any <HI>clear Evidence.</HI> Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> says, that <Q>the Law of Nature is the Law of <HI>Reason.</HI> <NOTE N="f." PLACE="foot">Vol. 5.

<P N="62">§ 62. It is equally difficult to form any <HI>pre∣cise</HI> Idea of what is commonly called <HI>the Reli∣gion of Nature.</HI> It is generally understood to be certain Principles of Religion and Rules of Con∣duct, which the ancient <HI>Heathen</HI> Priests and Philosophers found out by the meer <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> without any Help from divine Revela∣tion. But it is certain that they expressly <HI>dis∣claimed</HI> such a Guide; and, in Imitation of <HI>Moses,</HI> they ascribed all their religious Institutions to <HI>divine Inspiration.

All the Religions which were publickly estab∣lished or practised in the World, were supposed or pretended to come originally from divine In∣spiration; and all that was right and good in them, really did so, i. e. was taken, by Tradi∣tion, from the ancient Patriarchs or the Reve∣lations made by Jehovah to <HI>Moses</HI> and the Pro∣phets; though the Priests rather chose to ascribe them to those Gods who were best known to the common People, in order to gain greater Credit and Authority with them. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Upon which Account <HI>Clemens Alexandri∣nus</HI> expressly calls them Thieves. <HI>Stromata</HI> Lib.

<P N="63">§ 63. Indeed some Men have attempted to prove, from Scripture, that the <HI>Light of Nature</HI> is sufficient for <HI>Salvation,</HI> and that there is <HI>no Need</HI> of divine Revelation; particularly from Rom. i. 20. <HI>The invisible Things of him, from the Creation of the World, are clearly seen; being understood by the Things which are made; even his eternal Power and Godhead.</HI> I have before conceded, that when the Existence of God is once suggested to Men, and they are <HI>led in earnest</HI> to a due Contemplation of the Works of Creation, they would find the most <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>incontestible</HI> Evidence of the Being of a God. But then the Apostle no where asserts that Men, of their own <HI>meer Motion</HI> or Suggestion, would, in Fact, have come into such rational Inquiries, without those Notices and Suggestions which the <HI>Heathen</HI> generally had, from Tradition and divine Revelation. For God did not <HI>leave him∣self without Witness</HI> among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> in that the Light which he gave to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church,
<PB N="51" REF="009931_0054_0F7B3BB440DE9C48"/>
did, in so considerable a Measure, shine among them, in all successive Ages. And yet, not∣withstanding all the Light they had, in all these Ways, they are expressly said <HI>not to know God,</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. iv. 5.</NOTE> i. e. not to have <HI>such</HI> a Knowledge of him, as is necessary in order to Salvation; which in∣deed the wisest of them acknowledged, by their Inscription on the Altar — TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Whom,</HI> the Apostle says, <HI>ye igno∣rantly worship; him I declare unto you.</HI> They also urge that Text in Acts x. 34. <HI>God is no Re∣specter of Persons; but, in every Nation, he that feareth God and worketh Righteousness, is accept∣ed of him.</HI> But it is not said that any did so, by the <HI>meer Light of Nature,</HI> but rather in Con∣sequence of their receiving divine Revelation. For these Words were spoken of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who, though a <HI>Roman</HI> Centurion, was posted at <HI>Joppa,</HI> not fifty Miles from <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> where he had Opportunity to be well acquainted with the <HI>Jewish</HI> Religion, and probably with the Gospel; though, at first, under some imperfect and dis∣advantageous Representations; and therefore he needed better Instruction by the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> who was blamed, by some judaising Christians, for preaching to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> whom they, thro' a national Pride, were not willing to receive in∣to the Christian Church. They also urge Rom. ii. 14. <HI>The</HI> Gentiles <HI>which have not the Law, do, by Nature, the Things contained in the Law, —which shew the Work of the Law written in
<PB N="52" REF="009931_0055_0F7B3BB4C266BB18"/>
their Hearts.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Pool,</HI> in his <HI>Critics,</HI> men∣tions it as the most probable Opinion, that the Apostle here speaks of the <HI>converted Gentiles;</HI> for which he quotes several of the best Com∣mentators, who say this Sense is apparent from the whole Context: and they who suppose the Words may, in <HI>some Sense,</HI> be applied to the <HI>unconverted Gentiles;</HI> suppose that their Know∣ledge of the Law, extends no further than to leave them <HI>inexcuseable</HI> and <HI>self-condemned.</HI> Dr. <HI>Williots,</HI> in his Sermon on this Text, says, that the Design of the Apostle is to convince the <HI>judaising</HI> Christians of their Error, in refusing to admit the <HI>Gentile</HI> Converts into their Commu∣nion: and tells them that the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not the <HI>Law of Moses</HI> by <HI>natural</HI> Generation and Descent, as the <HI>Jews</HI> had; yet, upon their being <HI>converted</HI> to Christianity, did as fully keep the <HI>divine Law,</HI> as the <HI>Jews:</HI> which shews that the divine Law was <HI>now written in their Hearts,</HI> by the regenerating and sanctifying Influences of the Holy Spirit. And in this Sense, he says the Phrase <HI>Law written in their Hearts,</HI> is evi∣dently used in the Prophesies of Gospel-Times; particularly Ser. 31.33, 34. <Q>I will put my Law in their <HI>inward Parts,</HI> and <HI>write my Law in their Hearts,</HI> and they shall no more teach every Man his Neighbour,—for they shall all know me, from the greatest to the least.</Q> He concedes, that when God <HI>at first</HI> created Man, he wrote his Law upon his Heart; but, by the Fall, this Character is so obliterated, as that
<PB N="53" REF="009931_0056_0F7B3BB587A9CEA8"/>
there is <HI>now,</HI> no <HI>saving</HI> Impression of it, unless it be <HI>written</HI> again, by the <HI>renewing</HI> Influences of the divine Spirit.</P>
<P N="64">§ 64. But though Men, by the Light of Na∣ture, might find out so much of the <HI>moral Law</HI> as is plainly coincident with <HI>Self-Interest,</HI> yet they could not possibly discover a <HI>Mediator,</HI> or <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for Sin, or any Way whereby a sinful Creature might obtain Reconciliation with an <HI>offended God.</HI> Indeed many have supposed that they could obtain a Pardon by the <HI>meer Mercy</HI> of God, without a Mediator or any Satisfaction; but this Supposition has arisen wholly from their Ignorance of the <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> of the Divine <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Law,</HI> and so of the great <HI>Evil</HI> and just <HI>Demerit</HI> of Sin.</P>
<P N="65">§ 65. Divine Revelation fully informs us, that our highest Duty and Obligation is to be LIKE TO GOD, and conformed to his moral Perfections: and the divine <HI>Law</HI> being a Trans∣cript of the divine Nature, fully declares what Temper and Conduct in us, is a Conformity to that Standard. This is the principal, <HI>leading Sentiment</HI> which runs through the whole <HI>Bible.</HI> It is the Epitome of the <HI>moral Law</HI> delivered by <HI>Moses.</HI> Lev. xi. 44. <HI>Ye shall therefore sanc∣tify your Selves. Be ye holy, for I am holy.</HI>— So Chap. xix. 2. <HI>Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.</HI> This is again repeated in Chap. xx. 7. This is the Substance of the <HI>moral</HI> Precepts delivered by our blessed Saviour
<PB N="54" REF="009931_0057_0F7B3BB641F1AA58"/>
and the inspired Apostles. Matth. v. 48. <HI>Be ye therefore perfect as your Father, which is in Heaven, is perfect. Be ye merciful as your Fa∣ther which is in Heaven is merciful.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 16. <HI>Be ye holy, for I am holy. Be ye Followers of God</HI> (or Imitators of God) <HI>as dear Children.</HI> — As Man was at first made in the moral Image or Likeness to God, so the Recovery of that Image is his greatest Duty and highest Perfec∣tion. Coloss. iii. 10. <HI>Put on the new Man which is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image or in Conformity to the Image, of him that created him.</HI> So Ephes. iv. 16. <HI>Put off the old Man, which is corrupt;</HI> and <HI>Be ye renewed in the Spirit of your Minds; and put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness.</HI> 1 Cor. x. 31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God;</HI> that is, that the glorious Perfections of the di∣vine Nature might be exemplified and display'd in all your Conduct. The moral Perfections of the eternal and self-existent Being, are the pri∣mary Foundation and Standard of all Perfection in the Creature; and to which he ought to be conformed, according to that Rank, Model, or Order in which he is placed in the Creation.</P>
<P N="66">§ 66. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. Every rational Creature ought to be con∣formed to God, in his <HI>Holiness.</HI> Holiness is the moral Rectitude or Perfection of the divine Na∣ture; and comprehends all that can be called or conceived of as good, right, amiable or excel∣lent,
<PB N="55" REF="009931_0058_0F7B3BB730205BB8"/>
of the <HI>moral</HI> Kind. <HI>The sacred Oracles</HI> fully explain and illustrate this comprehensive Perfection; so far as the Knowledge of it can be conveyed by human Language: and <HI>special Illumination</HI> gives a more <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>realizing</HI> Conception of it. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Sanctitas est Entis rationalis Bonitas moralis.</L>

<P N="2">2. In his <HI>Justice.</HI> Justice is a permitting e∣very One to have or enjoy his <HI>own:</HI> or, it is a rendering to every One his <HI>Due,</HI> whether it be that <HI>Good</HI> or Happiness, or that <HI>Misery</HI> and Pun∣ishment which is <HI>due</HI> to him, or which he de∣serves, according to his Temper and Conduct.</P>
<P N="3">3. In his <HI>Goodness;</HI> which is a Disposition to <HI>do Good</HI> and communicate Happiness to other Beings, so far as is consistent with other Per∣fections.</P>
<P N="4">4. In his <HI>Truth;</HI> which is a Declaration in Words or Actions, of Things as they really are in themselves; or, at least, as they appear to our Minds.</P>
<P N="67">§ 67. These are the Elements of all that is morally good. And as every Duty is a neces∣sary Consequence of an inward, <HI>divine</HI> Dispo∣sition of Mind; so, from these divine Princi∣ples necessarily flow and result every <HI>moral</HI> Duty to <HI>God,</HI> our <HI>Neighbour</HI> and our <HI>Selves.</HI>— I shall therefore, in the</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="009931_0059_0F7B3BB7C1ED5110"/><HI>Last Place,</HI> exhibit a brief and general Scheme of moral Virtues and Duties;</P>
<P N="1">I. To God. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>love</HI> him. Love is a pleasing Appro∣bation of any Object; or such an Approbation of an Object, as is accompanied with Pleasure. And this arises both from the <HI>Amiableness</HI> of the Object in itself; and from a <HI>similar</HI> Dispo∣sition of Mind; whereby a Person is disposed to approve of, to be pleased with, and delighted in such an Object. And as God is the most perfect, amiable and excellent Being, we ought to love him with all our Hearts and Souls; and other Beings only so far as they bear a Resem∣blance to him, or for his Sake.</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>fear</HI> him. A Principle of Assimila∣tion to God necessarily produces a <HI>Fear</HI> of doing any Thing which may gain his <HI>Displeasure</HI> or Disapprobation; for this necessarily implies some Contrariety or Dissimilitude.</P>
<P N="3">3. To <HI>trust</HI> in him and depend upon him, in the Way of our Duty. This necessarily flows from a realizing View of the divine Perfections; especially Wisdom, Power, and Goodness.</P>
<P N="4">4. To <HI>worship</HI> him. An <HI>internal</HI> Sense and Approbation of the divine Perfections, will ne∣cessarily exert and express itself in <HI>external</HI> Words and Actions; which also have a Ten∣dency to strengthen and increase the Sense and Habit of our own Minds, and to produce the same Disposition in the Minds of others.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="57" REF="009931_0060_0F7B3BB9D65D99E8"/>5. To <HI>repent</HI> of Sin. A Mind which is, in the main, conformed to the moral Perfections of God, will necessarily be displeased with and hate every Thing which is contrary thereunto; which will always be accompanied with a Grief and Sorrow; especially as the Fault is within himself.</P>
<P>From this same Principle, all other Duties to God may, by the Assistance of divine Revelation, be easily deduced.</P>
<P N="68">§ 68. II. Those Duties which more imme∣diately respect our <HI>Neighbours</HI> or Mankind in general. The same divine Principle will dispose us to view <HI>all Mankind</HI> as the Creatures of God, originally made in his Image (and still retaining some Dispositions which may in some Respects be called good) as Fellow-Subjects to the same King, as Fellow-Servants of the same Lord; and treat them according to the Rules of Justice, Goodness and Truth. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. We should <HI>love</HI> them. That is we should approve of and take Delight in what is good in them; as it bears a Resemblance to some of the divine Perfections. We ought indeed to <HI>hate</HI> their bad Dispositions and Actions, but not their Persons: especially since we don't know, but that they may yet be the Objects of God's eternal Favour: We ought, at least, to love them with a <HI>Love of Benevolence:</HI> and endea∣vour to promote their temporal and eternal Hap∣piness; so far as is consistent with other Duties.
<PB N="58" REF="009931_0061_0F7B3BBA95F5A888"/>
And that from a Principle of Obedience to God who has commanded us <HI>to love our Neighbour as ourselves</HI> and <HI>to do good to all Men.</HI> And for this Reason, because to do so, is to be <HI>like to God</HI> and the Children of our Father which is in Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. We ought to conduct towards them ac∣cording to <HI>Justice.</HI> We should never invade the Right and Property of another: but freely permit him to use and enjoy whatsoever is his <HI>own.</HI> And that because we hereby act accord∣ing to the Nature and Will of the supreme Pro∣prietor of all Things; who has commanded us to <HI>render to every one his Due—to owe no Man any Thing; and not to defraud or go beyond our Neighbour in any Matter.</HI> And that because <HI>the righteous Lord loveth Righteousness;</HI> and that <HI>to do Justice is more acceptable than Sacrifice;</HI> and that <HI>diverse Weights and diverse Measures are an Abomination to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And as to <HI>punitive</HI> Justice, or rendering to every Man that Misery or <HI>Punishment</HI> which is his due; so far as any Man is, by the Word or Providence of God, made his Minister <HI>to execute Wrath on him that doeth Evil,</HI> he is bound to do it according to the <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of God, and those subordinate Rules which are given him to judge by.</P>
<P N="3">3. We ought to observe <HI>Truth</HI> in all our Words and Declarations: so as never designedly to <HI>deceive</HI> our Neighbour. For Truth is an es∣sential Perfection of God and cannot be infringed
<PB N="59" REF="009931_0062_0F7B3BBAD110F138"/>
upon by us, without a practical Denial that God is true. Deut. xxxii. 4. <HI>He has stiled himself the God of Truth;</HI> has commanded us to <HI>speak the Truth.</HI> Ephes. iv. 25. And has declared that he <HI>hates a lying Tongue.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Every Man ought to perform the Duties incumbent upon him as a <HI>Member of Society,</HI> or as resulting from the various Relations he stands in to others. From divine Institutions and hu∣man Compacts, various Relations arise, such as, Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Ma∣gistrates and Subjects, Fellow-Citizens, or Mem∣bers of lesser Communities having an equal Right with ourselves; from which many <HI>Duties</HI> do result, according to the Rules of Justice, Goodness and Truth; of which many Authors have treated largely and well: all which are to be observed in Conformity to the divine <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Law. Render therefore to every one their Due. Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Ho∣nour, Tribute to whom Tribute,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Whatsoever Things ye would that others should do unto you, do ye the same to them.</HI></P>
<P N="69">§ 69. III. Those Duties which more im∣mediately relate to <HI>ourselves.</HI> From the same Principle of Justice and Goodness, every Man, considering himself as <HI>one</HI> of the Creatures of <HI>God;</HI> ought to endeavour to promote <HI>his own</HI> Happiness, as well as the Happiness of <HI>others;</HI> and therefore ought to cultivate and improve his rational Powers and moral Habits; to regulate
<PB N="60" REF="009931_0063_0F7B3BBB94CFA6E8"/>
the Appetites and Inclinations of his Body, so as to render it the most proper Organ of his Soul: and in general to promote his own Perfection and Happiness; so far as is consistent with those Duties which more immediately relate to God and his Fellow-Men; acting with a principal View of Conformity to the Perfections and Law of God; and with a subordinate and additional Stimulous or Incitement of acting according to natural Inclination and Self-Interest: as a Means appointed by God more fully and effectually to incite him to do that which was his <HI>antecedent</HI> Duty. But to act upon this last Motive <HI>alone,</HI> without any Regard to the <HI>former,</HI> is to act up∣on a Principle very little superior to the brutal Instinct.</P>
<P N="70">§ 70. This is a <HI>short and general Scheme</HI> of all the Duties incumbent upon Men, together with the <HI>Foundation</HI> of the Obligation they are under to perform them. Upon these Principles a Man may safely and profitably read the com∣mon Systems of <HI>Ethics;</HI> which, though they are generally built upon wrong Foundations, yet the external Rules of Practice are generally <HI>right</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> For Self-Love, extended to a public View of Things (that is, the Interest which each Individual has in the publick Good) will, in most Instances, lead Men to the same Rules of external Conduct, as result from a Confor∣mity to the divine Perfections. And since such a Conformity does naturally produce our own Good and Happiness, we may take the <HI>inverse
<PB N="61" REF="009931_0064_0F7B3BBC49B53EA8"/>
Method;</HI> and, by observing what is most con∣ducive to our <HI>own Good,</HI> may, in many Instances, find out what is agreable to the <HI>divine Perfec∣tions;</HI> tho' in a much more <HI>uncertain</HI> and im∣perfect Manner.</P>
<P N="71">§ 71. For in this <HI>inverse</HI> Method of finding out our Duty, some Errors have crept into most Systems of <HI>Ethics;</HI> and one which I apprehend to be very gross, viz. That, in many Cases, <HI>it is lawful for Men to</HI> LYE; particularly to Per∣sons who are not of <HI>Years of Discretion;</HI> to those who are <HI>sick, mad,</HI> or <HI>non compos Mentis;</HI> to <HI>Enemies;</HI> and generally in all Cases where a Man can save himself or his Friend from any unreasonable Suffering. The Authors generally go upon this Principle, that the sole Criterion of <HI>moral</HI> Good, is <HI>natural</HI> Good or Happiness. That the Evil of Lying, in any Case, does not consist in <HI>Contradiction to Truth;</HI> but in the <HI>In∣jury</HI> it does to others. Therefore it is <HI>lawful to lye</HI> in all Cases where no <HI>Injury</HI> accrues to any particular Person; or, upon the Whole, more Good than Hurt. Some Authors (who think it is a little too <HI>bare-faced,</HI> or contrary to the common Sense of Mankind, to assert, in express Terms, that it is lawful to <HI>lye</HI>) say, that an <HI>Untruth</HI> or false Assertion, in such Cases, be∣comes <HI>no Lye;</HI> or, if it is so called, yet it is <HI>no Crime.</HI> Mr. <HI>Grove,</HI> in his Ethics, Part II. Chap.

XI. says this is now become pretty generally the Sense of the learned World. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Grotius de Jure Pacis &amp; Belli, Liber III. Cap. 1. Puffendorf de Jure Naturae &amp; Gentium Observat. 250. In Eng. Book IV. Chap. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P N="72">§ 72. However consistent this Opinion may be with the Principles of these Authors, or how generally soever it may be received, yet it plain∣ly appears to be contrary to the immutable <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Law of God.</HI> And I fully agree with the great Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> that <Q>the Essence of a Lye consists in the <HI>designed Falshood asserted;</HI> and not barely in the <HI>Injury</HI> which attends it, tho' that is an Aggravation;</Q> and that <Q><HI>every Lye is a Sin,</HI> abominable to God. <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Amesii Medulla Lib. II. Cap. 21. De Con∣scientiae Casibus, Lib. V. Cap. 53.</NOTE></Q> Indeed it may be demonstrated that this Principle is con∣trary to Self-Interest, taken in a large extensive Sense, as including the Interest which each In∣dividual has in the general Good of Mankind, for a long Course of Time. For this Opinion and Practice will necessarily destroy all Faith and Confidence among Men: and I <HI>never can believe</HI> a Man, in any Case where I can imagine that he can suppose it will be for his own or his Friend's immediate Interest to tell a Lye.</P>
<P N="73">§ 73. But as every Man will run the Venture of his own Interest as he pleases; I think we can build upon no certain Foundation in Mora∣lity,
<PB N="63" REF="009931_0066_0F7B3BBDC9D68248"/>
but the <HI>divine Perfections and Law.</HI> Truth is an <HI>eternal, immutable</HI> and <HI>inflexible</HI> Perfection of the divine Nature; and cannot be limited, even in our Conceptions, by any other Perfec∣tions: as the Exercise of the divine Power seems to be limited by Wisdom; but it never can be <HI>wise</HI> in God to act contrary to his own <HI>Truth.</HI> A Conformity therefore to this Attribute, must be <HI>perfect</HI> and without Exception; and no Fault of our own or others, can give us a Dispensa∣tion, in <HI>any Case</HI> to act contrary to it. The di∣vine Law, in this Case, is absolute and without any Limitation. Ephes. iv. 25. <HI>Put away Ly∣ing. Speak the Truth every Man to his Neigh∣bour.</HI> 1 Thes. iv. 6. <HI>Let no Man go beyond,</HI> or defraud, <HI>his Neighbour, in</HI> ANY MATTER; <HI>for God is the Avenger of such.</HI></P>
<P N="74">§ 74. As to the Instances of <HI>approved Decep∣tion</HI> pretended to be found in <HI>Scripture;</HI> they are all easily solved by this one <HI>Distinction.</HI> There is a plain Distinction between my assert∣ing a Proposition which is <HI>false;</HI> and my as∣serting a Proposition which is <HI>true,</HI> and another thro' a Mistake, not of my Proposition, as it is really intended by me, but of some relative Circumstances, draws a <HI>false Inference</HI> from what I said. In this Case he <HI>deceives himself,</HI> thro' his own Rashness and Want of Considera∣tion. And if it be in a Case in which I am under no Kind of <HI>Obligation</HI> to tell him the
<PB N="64" REF="009931_0067_0F7B3BBF1EFA2530"/>
<HI>whole</HI> Truth, or every Truth which has any remote <HI>Relation</HI> to what I said; then it is no Fault in me, to <HI>let him alone,</HI> to deceive him∣self. And that even though, by knowing his Disposition, I <HI>expected</HI> before-hand, that he would make such a <HI>wrong Inference.</HI> But if I was under <HI>any Obligation,</HI> by the divine Law, my own Promise or otherwise, to tell him the <HI>whole</HI> Truth in that Matter, and do not; then indeed I am guilty of a <HI>great Fault</HI> by my Neglect: but that alone does not constitute a Lye in the first Proposition. But then my As∣sertion must be in plain and express Words, which being taken according to the <HI>common Use</HI> of Language, or other known <HI>instituted Signs,</HI> shall <HI>truly</HI> convey my Ideas. For if I use any Kind of <HI>Equivocations</HI> or mental Reservations, with a Design that he should <HI>misunderstand</HI> me, then I <HI>deceive him,</HI> and that in such a Manner as is but little, if any Thing better than a <HI>plain Lye.</HI> But if he, from <HI>my Words,</HI> takes up the true Proposition, as it was contained in <HI>my Mind;</HI> and then inconsiderately draws a <HI>false Inference</HI> from it, and acts accordingly; he deceives <HI>him∣self</HI> and not <HI>I.</HI></P>
<P N="75">§ 75. As suppose, I see a <HI>Madman</HI> with a Sword in his Hand, pursuing another, who is at present out of Sight; and I tel him, that four Minutes ago I saw him go into such a House, and he thereupon supposes, that he is there <HI>now,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="009931_0068_0F7B3BBF912A1E88"/>
and accordingly goes in there to seek him: and I don't tell the Madman that I afterwards saw him come out, and go another Way: this is no <HI>Lye</HI> or <HI>Deception</HI> in me; for I told him the <HI>Truth</HI> and the whole <HI>Truth,</HI> so far as I was obliged or undertook to do it: and what followed was his <HI>mistaken Inference</HI> from the <HI>Truth</HI> which I told him. Indeed if he had asked me if I be∣lieved that he was there <HI>now,</HI> and I had answered <HI>Yes,</HI> I should have been guilty of <HI>Lying.</HI> But then I might have refused to give him any Ans∣wer at all, without any Violation of Truth.</P>
<P N="76">§ 76. So in <HI>Stratagems in War:</HI> if I retreat or flee before my Enemy; and from this Action he infers that I am beat, discouraged, or will <HI>fight no more:</HI> and so pursues me with Precipi∣tation, and gives me an Advantage against him; and then I turn back and take it, as I before <HI>de∣signed,</HI> I am guilty of <HI>no Lye</HI> or active <HI>Deception:</HI> I only let him alone to <HI>deceive himself,</HI> by not revealing to him a Truth which I was under no Obligation to discover. But if I strike my Colours, hold up a Flag of Truce, or use any other known, <HI>instituted</HI> Sign of Submission or Cessation of Arms; and he thereupon comes to me unarmed; and I fall upon him and kill him; I am guilty of perfidious <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> because I acted contrary to my <HI>own</HI> Declaration.</P>
<P N="77">§ 77. This Distinction and Rule is plain: all the Danger in the Application of it will be this;
<PB N="66" REF="009931_0069_0F7B3BC028BFDE98"/>
— a Man, in some Cases, may think himself <HI>not oblig'd</HI> to discover a Truth, when he really is obliged, from the Principles of Justice, Truth or Goodness. But a precise Determination of the Boundaries of Obligation, in all such Cases, would require considerable Time, and does not belong to the present Question. Upon the whole therefore it appears, that a Man ought not, in ANY Case, or under any Circumstances whatsoever, knowingly to <HI>declare</HI> or <HI>assert</HI> any Proposition or Thing which is a <HI>Lye, false</HI> or <HI>untrue:</HI> and if he does, he contradicts and im∣plicitly denies the <HI>Truth</HI> and Law of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>These Things, duly considered, will be suf∣ficient to direct us how to distinguish between the <HI>justifiable</HI> and <HI>unjustifiable</HI> Instances of <HI>seem∣ing or supposed Deception,</HI> recorded in the sacred Scripture.</P>
