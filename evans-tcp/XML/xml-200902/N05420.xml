<Q><BIBL>Luke xxi. 34.</BIBL> <HI>And take Heed to yourselves, lest at any Time, your Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness, and Cares of this World, and so that Day come upon you unawares.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the Day of our Death, and the Day of Judgement, will quickly overtake us all; when we are to be eternally fixed in a State of consumate Glory and Happi∣ness, or of everlasting Shame and Misery: Ac∣cording as we shall be found, to have conducted ourselves here in the Body. It is of the last Importance to us all, that we live every one of our Days, so as to be in a continual Readiness, for that great Day of solemn Accounts; when God will bring to Light every secret and hiden Work of Darkness; and Judge the Secrets of Men's Hearts According to the Gospel. Lest that Day coming upon us unawares; we be found unprepared and unready; and so perish for ever without Remedy. Concerning which, we are called upon here in our Text, to take Heed to ourselves.—Our Blessed Lord Jesus who spake these Words; had been treating on the Destruction of Jerusalem, of the fearful Signs and terrible Dissolations of that Day; when the Son of Man should come, to execute Vengeance upon that People, for their great Sin
<PB N="3" REF="006862_0003_102A7EA59FA30790"/>of Rejecting and Crucifying him, the Lord of Life and Glory. Which Destruction of the Jewish State; was a Sort of Emblem, of the coming of the Son of God, to judge the World. And so the Day of our Death and the Day of Judgment; will be as Important a Day to us, as that was to the Jews; and a Day for which we are equally concerned to be in a Readiness. and therefore the Words of our Text, are as needful and applicable to us, in the View of ap∣proaching Death and Judgment; as to the im∣mediate Hearers of Christ, with Regard to the threatned Destruction of Jerusalem. For Death and Judgement, even as to them, were the main Things implyed in the coming of that Day. But here then, in the Words of our Text, you have the Call and Command of Christ, to <HI>take Heed to yourselves,</HI> to look to it, with a strict Guard and Watch over yourselves, as in a Case of great Danger, in a Matter of the utmost Importance, <HI>lest at any Time your Hearts be overcharged;</HI> lest the Powers and Faculties of your Minds be Cloged in their Operations; <HI>with Surfeiting and Drunkenness,</HI> by eating or drinking to Excess, so as either to overload the Stomach or impair the Brain; or lest the Heart be filled with carking and solicitous <HI>Cares</HI> and Concerns about the Things <HI>of this present Life; And so that Day,</HI> the Day of Death and
<PB N="4" REF="006862_0004_102A7EA781AC1DA8"/>Judgment, <HI>come upon you unawares.</HI> For such Indulgences, will assuredly render you, utterly unfit and unready for that great Day; and so be your eternal Ruin. And therefore ye had Need, take Heed to yourselves, lest at any Time ye be overtaken therein. But it is the Surfeiting and Drunkenness here spoken of, that I chiefly design to treat of at this Time. And so the Doctrine to be noted from the Words may be this.</P>
<P>Doc. <HI>That to eat or to drink to Excess, so as to have the Heart overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness, is a very ruinous and destructive Sin, of which it concerns every one, to take Heed to themselves, lest at any Time, they be over taken therein.</HI></P>
<P>In speaking to which I shall consider and shew.</P>

<P>But,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>To consider and Shew, what it is, to eat or to drink to Excess, so as to have the Heart over∣charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006862_0005_102A7EA9D302A360"/>
Because it is innocent and Lawful, and even a Duty, to eat and to drink; therefore Men are ready to flatter themselves, that they are not cheargeable with Surfeiting and Drunkenness; except they run into such very gross Excess therein, as wholly to over power all their Facul∣ties and Senses. But every Degree of Excess in Meats and in Drinks, is a Degree of Surfeiting and Drunkenness. But clearly to set forth, what it is, to eat or to drink to Excess, it is to be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the End and Design of Meats and of Drinks, is to satisfy the innocent Cravings of Nature; and so to fit for the Service of God and the Business of Life.</HI> As God has been pleased to frame our Bodies so, as that Meats and Drinks are absolutely requisite, to nourish and strengthen our animal Nature. So he has been pleased, wisely to implant in our Natures, those Appetites called Hunger and Thirst; which as the Body needs Refreshment, naturally raise an uneasy Sensation in us; thereby to excite us to take needful Sustenance; without which, Men would some Times be in Danger of Neglecting Food, to the great Injury of their animal Nature. And as God for wise Ends, has implanted these Natural Appetites. So from the Openings of his bountiful Hand, he is wont in the common Course of his Providence; to grant a plentiful
<PB N="6" REF="006862_0006_102A7EAC0BC02208"/>Supply of Meats and Drinks; and that in a very great and pleasing Variety, to satisfy all the innocent Cravings of Nature. But then these Cravings of Nature, and the Provision which God in his good Providence makes for the Sup∣ply thereof; are for much higher and nobler Purposes, than meerly to gratify and please the Flesh: Even that our Hearts might be filled, with Gratitude and Thankfulness to God; and that we might be strengthened for his Service, and for all the necessary Duties and Business of Life. And therefore our Appetites of Hunger and Thirst, are then only innocent, when they crave no more, than is good for our Nature; for our Nounshment, Strengthening and Com∣fort. And indeed, so far to gratify these Ap∣petites, as tends to fill our Hearts with Grati∣tude to God for his Bounties; and also to Ca∣pacitate us for his Service, and the necessary Duties of Life; is not only innocent and lawful; but even a Duty, enjoyned in the sixth Com∣mandment. Which requires all lawful En∣deavours to preserve our own Lives. And to such a Degree, Men may truely eat and drink for the Glory of God, as we are required. 1 Cor. x. 31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> All Things are and were created for God's Glory. And to this End, should we live, and to
<PB N="7" REF="006862_0007_102A7EAEB38F0538"/>this End should we improve all the good Creatures of God, even to his Glory. But then.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To eat or to drink, so as to disorder the Faculties of Body or of Mind, and render our∣selves unfit for the Service of God, or the Duties of Life; is to overcharge the Heart with Sur∣feiting and Drunkenness.</HI> While a moderate Portion of Meats and of Drinks, by the Good Providence of God, kindly nourishes and strengthens our animal Nature; a greater Mea∣sure overloads the Stomach, blunts the Senses, and renders Men dull and listless; or intoxicates the Brain, and stupifies the Mind. And so in∣disposes Men, either for the Service of God, or the Duties of Life. And thus to eat or to drink, to such a Degree, as to incapacitate our∣selves in any Measure, for a due Discharge of the Duties which we owe, to God, to our Neighbour or ourselves; is so far to frustrate the good End and Design of Meats, and of Drinks: And therefore is an excessive Use and Abuse thereof. Every Degree of which, so far as it overcharges the Heart, intoxicates the Mind, or blunts the Senses, and incapacitates for Duty, is a Measure of Surfeiting and Drunken∣ness. But in this Excess, there are various Degrees; though every Degree of Excess is Sin. But the more the Heart is overcharged, and the Powers and Faculties incapacitated for
<PB N="8" REF="006862_0008_102A7EB0F329DAC8"/>Duty; the more gross and heinous is the Sin. To eat and drink so far only, as is truely for our Nourishment and Comfort, falls within the Laws of Christian Temperance and Sobriety. But whatsoever is more than this, is Evil, be∣ing a Transgression of the Laws of Nature and of Christ: And is a Measure of Surfeiting and Drunkenness. But,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Of the ruinous and destructive Nature, of this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenness; or of eating and drinking to Excess, with the sad and fatal Consequences thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Excess in Meats and in Drinks, have in many Respects, the same Tendency and the same bad Consequence. Tho' that of intemperate drink∣ing, as it is commonly much the most Preva∣lent, so it is ordinarily attended, with much the most fatal Consequences. And to this therefore I shall chiefly have my Eye, in considering the ruinous and destructive Nature of Intempe∣rance. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It impairs the Constitution, and enfeebles the Powers and Faculties of Body and of Mind.</HI> It don't only incapacitate to Duty, while the Heart is overcharged. But it tends to impair the animal Frame; to bring on Diseases; and so to shorten Men's Days, and hasten them down to the Grave, as it were before their Time. At least it much enfeebles Men's Powers and
<PB N="9" REF="006862_0009_102A7EB3319B0150"/>Faculties, it consumes their Strength, it fades their Beauty, it weakens their Reason, shat∣ters their Judgment, and stupifies Conscience. And so it tends to bring Men down, as to their Powers and Faculties, to be even as Children and Fools. Temperance is a great Friend to our natural Capacities, and tends to strengthen them. But every Fit of Intemperance, tends to enfeeble all a Man's Powers; and so to bring him down to the Dust, or to a Level even with the Beasts.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a great Moth to Men's temporal Estates; and tends to bring Poverty upon themselves and their Families.</HI></P>
<P>Surfeiting and Drunkenness, is an eating Can∣ker, a fatal Consumption, to Men's Estates. Both, as it is attended with needless and extra∣vagant Expences, and especially, as it incapaci∣tates Men for their Business; prevents their be∣ing Diligent and prudent, and occasions much mispence of Time; in drowsiness, sauntring and Idleness, or in foolish, vain and wicked Company. And so tends to bring on many bad Habits, which soon plunge Men and their Families into Poverty and Distress. For as the wise Man says, <HI>The Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to Poverty.</HI> And accordingly it is no uncommon Thing in the World, to see very likely and promising Men, with fair and handsome Estates,
<PB N="10" REF="006862_0010_102A7EB56B69FF98"/>not only ruined, as to their own Usefulness and Improvement in the World; but plunged into the very Depths of Poverty, Cloathed with Rags, their Wives and Children turned out of House and Home, and themselves become as Vaga∣bonds on the Earth: Only thro' Surfeiting and Drunkenness, as the Root of all this dreadful Calamity. A Spectacle, that might well make a Heart of Stone to relent and weep: That to gratify a filthy Lust, Men should bring them∣selves and their Families, into such deplorable Ruin; even as to the present Life. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Surfeiting and Drunkenness unman's Men, and makes them even a Shame and Reproach among Men.</HI></P>
<P>Of all Sins, it makes Men appear the most deformed and ridiculous; so that it renders them, a Laughing Stock and Scorn, even to Children. While Men's Heads are intoxicated and Swim with Fumes, they are ready to count the World all their own; who, so happy so witty and wise as they! While at the same Time, all their Beholders look on them, with Pity and Grief, or with Scorn and Contempt, making them the Fool of their Play, their Laugh and Derision. So that one would think, a Man that has any Sense of Honour; and any manly Re∣gard to his own Reputation and good Name; would rather chuse to Die, even a Thousand
<PB N="11" REF="006862_0011_102A7EB80D2A50C8"/>Deaths; than to drink himself such a Scorn and Derision among Men. <HI>A good Name is better than precious Ointment.</HI> But a Man's good Name is gone to all Intents, when once he has drank himself, into the Name of a Drunkard. And instead of being honoured and esteemed, he can expect nothing, but to be the Scorn and Derision, even of the lowest and most ignoble Part of his Species. <HI>Wine is a Mocker,</HI> and it makes Men a Mock and Reproach among Men. And.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Surfeiting and Drunkenness, is a Sin lead∣ing to many other Sins.</HI></P>
<P>It lays a Man open and renders him an easy Prey to every Temptation. It so takes away the Reason and Judgment, that it leaves Men without any Guard and Watch over themselves; and so leads to a Thousand Extravagances and Follies. It fills Men's Mouths with vain Bab∣blings, with unseemly, silly and foolish Talk∣ing. Yea it imboldens Men, to take God's Name in vain, to Curse and Swear and Lie in Jest: And to make a Mock and Derision of Things Sacred and Divine. It prompts Men to speak Evilly and Reproachfully of their Neighbours without Cause; and to slander and revile the Vertuous and Good; and is many Times the Occasion of a Tumultuous Feud, of boisterous, haughty and angry Passions. <HI>Strong
<PB N="12" REF="006862_0012_102A7EBAF0405F08"/>Drink is Raging.</HI> Prov. xx. 1. And so hurries Men into Quarrels and Contentions, to Spite and Revenge; and sometimes even to Blows and Blood shed. As the Wise Man says, <HI>Who hath Wo? Who hath Sorrow? Who hath Conten∣tions? Who hath Babbling? Who hath Wounds without Cause? Who hath Redness of Eyes? They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to seek mixt Wine.</HI> Prov. xxiii. 29, 30. Yea it lays open and exposes all a Man's Weakness, Frailties and Imperfections: What ever Follies, Lust and Passions he is incident unto; an intoxi∣cated Brain throws off the Covering, and Exposes all the Man's Nakedness. It betrays his most secret Betrustments, to his own Shame, and the Shame of his Friend. Sometimes it makes Men very Talkative in Matters of Religion; full of Con∣fidence, and expressive of great Joys and Com∣forts; to their own great Shame, and the great Reproach and Scandal of the Religion which they profess: Which of all Thing is most grievous and shocking to behold. And it is also a great Incentive to fleshly Lusts, and to wanton lacivious and unchast Words and Actions. And often occasions Quarrels and Contentions in Families. Yea it is a leading Thing to all Man∣ner of Iniquity. Besides, it utterly indisposes to every Religious Duty; excludes all serious Thoughts out of the Mind; and shuts the
<PB N="13" REF="006862_0013_102A7EBD271B0838"/>Reading of God's Word, and secret and Family Prayer, out of their Families and out of their Closets; or makes Men's Prayers, offered with the Fumes of an intoxicated Brain, a most hor∣rid Abomination indeed to the Lord. And verily there can be no true Fear of God; no Regard for his Glory; no true Devotion at Heart, no true Gratitude and Praise to God, no Watching and Striving against the World and the Flesh, no Aspiring after Heavenly Things, no true Mournings and Relentings for Sin, no perfecting Holiness in the Fear of God and no Runing for Eternal Life, while the Heart is overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness. But all Pretensions to Re∣ligion in this Case, are a Reproach to Religion itself; and a most horrid Offence and Abomi∣nation both to God and to Men. And the Interest of the Soul inevitably runs back, and sinks with an inconceivable Swiftness down into the Depths of Pollution and Guilt. And so,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Surfeiting and Drunkenness do inevitably unfit the Soul for Death and Judgment; and expose it to certain and Everlasting Ruin and Destruction.</HI> As it is a Sin that impairs Man's rational Powers, that inflames every Lust, and leads on to a Flood of Inquity; so it is a Sin that doth vile Dishonour to God, that abates his Mercies, that pollutes the Soul, that loads
<PB N="14" REF="006862_0014_102A7EBEB6A5AB78"/>it with Guilt, and that renders it utterly unmeet for the Kingdom of Heaven; and so exposeth it to the avenging Strokes of Divine Justice. And such God has assured us, shall not inherit his Heavenly Kingdom. 1 Cor. vi. 9. 10. <HI>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither Forni∣cators, nor Idolators, &amp;c. nor Drunkards, shall inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> And again. Gal. v. 19. 20. <HI>Now the Works of the Flesh are manifest, which are These, Adultery, Fornication, &amp;c. and Drunkenness, of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in Time past, that they which do such Things, shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> And wo therefore, as it is written, Isai. v. 22. <HI>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink Wine, and Men of Strength to mingle Strong Drink.</HI> And wo to such indeed, for they are going in the high Road to Ruin and De∣struction; they are heaping up to themselves Shame, Poverty and Reproach in this World, and treasuring up to themselves Wrath against the Day of Wrath. And when ever Death and Judgment over takes them, they must, without a deep and thorough Repentance, inevitably ly down in everlasting Shame and Confusion, un∣der the eternal Wrath and Curse of God. For He that can't lie has said, they shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. And therefore, when
<PB N="15" REF="006862_0015_102A7EC1475EDF10"/>that great Day which is hastening, shall once over∣take the Sinner in his Surfeiting and Drunken∣ness, he can no more Delight himself in his inordinate Lusts: But must change his delicious Cups, for the Wine of God's Wrath, <HI>poured out without Mixture into the Cup of his Indignation:</HI> Without so much as one Drop of Water to cool a scorched Tongue. And then may it be said with an Emphasis, as in Joel, 1. 5. <HI>Awake ye Drunkards, and Weep, and Howl, all ye Drinkers of Wine, because of the new Wine, for it is cut off from your Mouth.</HI> Oh how fearfully ruinous and destructive indeed, in Time and forever, is this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenness. But.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>To shew the great Need, that every one should take Heed to themselves, lest at any Time, they be overtaken in this ruinous Sin.</HI> To take Heed lest at any Time we be overtaken in this Sin; <HI>Implyes,</HI> that we keep a very strict Guard and Watch over ourselves: Lest under a Pretence of satisfying the innocent Cravings of Nature; and of Eating and Drinking for the needful Refreshment and Nourishment of our Bodies: We take more than is meet; overcharge our Hearts, and plunge ourselves into a Degree of Surfeiting and Drunkenness. And that we Watch and Guard ourselves, not only, against a prevailing Habit of Excess herein, but against
<PB N="16" REF="006862_0016_102A7EC429E4FDA8"/>taking to Excess at any Time, and in any Degree; lest Excess at one Time, and in one Degree, enlarge our Appetite and inflame our Thirst; so as to make Way for Excess at another Time, and in a greater Degree; till we be overborne, and carried headlong down the Precipice of this ruinous Sin. Again, this taking Heed to ourselves, <HI>Implyes,</HI> that we carefully keep at a safe and secure Distance from this Sin. That we think not to dally with it; that we give not way to the Gratifi∣cation of our Appetites, to the farthest Extent of what we imagine our Natures may possibly bear. <HI>Especially</HI> if we find, that at any Time, we have been overtaken in any Degree of Ex∣cess, and have eat or drank more than was meet; or if we find that inordinate Cravings and Thirstings begin secretly to grow in, and prevail upon us; that we do then awake, to a double Guard and Watch over ourselves; to keep at the greatest Distance from, and even wholly to deny ourselves, any Use at all, of those particular Meats, and Drinks, whereby we are in special Danger: Rather than to venture the fatal Hazard of Surfeiting and Drunkenness. To pretend to take Heed against any Evil, and yet tamper with the Temptations to it; as to pretend to take Heed against Surfeit∣ing and Drunkenness; and yet indulge ones self
<PB N="17" REF="006862_0017_102A7EC69430ABB0"/>to the very Borders of Excess, and frequent drinking Places and drinking Company, is but a vain Pretence. For the intoxicating Cup is insnaring, and soon alures to Excess. But he that would take due Heed to himself, must watchfully shun the Way, the Place, and Company, and even the very Appearance of Excess. And stand at the greatest Distance from those Evils, with which he finds himself most easily beset. <HI>And now Men have all Need to watch most heedfully, against this Sin of Intemperance.</HI> Not only because it is such a Ruinous and destructive Evil, to themselves and their Families, to their Bodies and to their Souls, to their Honour, Interest and Welfare, in Time and to all Eternity: All which should be weighty and powerful Motives with us, to excite us, to utmost watchfulness against this Sin. But there are farther Reasons also, why we had need take Heed lest at any Time we be overtaken in this Sin. As</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because it is a Sin that we are all na∣turally incident unto, and in Danger of.</HI> As we are fallen Creatures, the noble Powers of our Minds are wofully ruined, and the Fleshly Appetites are prone to break out into great Exorbitancy, to exceed their proper Bounds and run into Excess. So that we are naturally inclined to exceed the Bounds of Temperance
<PB N="18" REF="006862_0018_102A7EC823F51018"/>and Sobriety; to let Reason and Judgment give way to Inclination and Lust; and so to be governed by fleshly Appetites and Desires, more than by Reason and Judg∣ment. So that unless we take Heed to ourselves, to mortify and keep under the Deeds of the Body; our craving Appetites will soon plunge us into Excess. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a Sin which Men are very ready to palliate and excuse themselves in; at least, as to some of the first and lowest Degrees thereof.</HI> For as every Kind of Meat and Drink is given for the Use and Benefit of Man, and may lawfully be used for our good and Comfort. Therefore Men in Com∣pliance with their exorbitant Appetites and Desires, are ready to perswade themselves, that more is for their Comfort, than is in any wise for their good. And so, under the Notion of taking for their Comfort, they excuse themselves in taking to Excess: So much as really to discompose their Minds, and render them foolish and ridiculous; though they drown not all their Senses. So that it is an insnaring Evil, that creeps upon
<PB N="19" REF="006862_0019_102A7ECA5D9F5020"/>Men unawares. And therefore had need to be heedfully watched against; as a se∣cret undermining Enemy, that doth not make the first Onset, by an open Assault, but by underhand Craft and De∣ceit. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is a very growing Sin.</HI> Where it once begins to get Footing it often gains Ground apace, and is rarely expelled. As Intempe∣rance at the first, commonly steals upon Men by insensible Degrees; so every Degree leaves vitiated Taint, and inflamed Thirst behind, which lays the Foundation, for still greater and greater Excess; as Time and Opportunity serves, or Temptation presents: Till some∣times Surfeiting and Drunkenness, to a very great and shameful Degree, gets strongly rooted, even into a prevailing Habit in Men; and they get deep in the Pit, and wofully in∣tangled in the Snare; ere they are aware of the Danger they are in. And then alas, exorbitant Cravings being grown into a Ha∣bit, 'tis hard for Men thoroughly to reform. <HI>As for the Ethiopian to change his Skin or the Leopard his Spots.</HI> And thus it is in Fact
<PB N="20" REF="006862_0020_102A7ECC509967A8"/>too rarely seen in the World, that an habituated Drunkard, ever escapes the Snares, to lead a Life truely Sober and temperate. And therefore Men had need take Heed betimes, left at any Time, their Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunken∣ness; and so this Sin steal upon them, and get the Prevalency over them una∣wares; to the utter Ruin of their Name and Estate, Welfare and Happiness, for Time and Eternity. And,</P>
<P><HI>Finally, It is a Sin that doth vile Dis∣honour to God.</HI> As it leads to many other Sins, exposes all a Man's Frailties and Fol∣lies, and indisposeth to a due Performance of any religious Duty; so it Leads to in∣numerable Provocations against Heaven; doth the vilest Dishonour to Religion; and gives even the Heathen Occasion to scoff and Blaspheme. So that if Men have any Regard to the Glory of God, any Fear to offend him, any Desire to honour and please him, or any Regard for the Honour of that Religion which they pro∣fess, or desire to share the Blessings, or
<PB N="21" REF="006862_0021_102A7ED000E00790"/>Care to shun the Curses of it: They had need take Heed to themselves in Earnest; lest at any Time their Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunken∣ness.</P>
<P>But to come to the,</P>
<P><HI>Improvement.</HI> Our first Use, may be of <HI>Solemn Warning, to all such as are given to intemperate Indulgences.</HI> Would to God there were none such amongst us, For it is too shameful an Evil once to be mentioned, among those that call them∣selves Christians. But alas, it is greatly to be feared, that it is a very growing and prevailing Iniquity; both more publickly and privately; to the great Scandal and Reproach of the Christian Name. May the Lord of his infinite Mercy, give an hearing Ear, and an understanding Heart, to all such of you my Hearers, as are given to inordinate Appetites and Desires; that you may awake to a Sense of your Danger, and be roased up to take Diligent Heed to yourselves. For is strong Drink become your Master; are you fallen into
<PB N="22" REF="006862_0022_102A7ED18F9DDD20"/>the Habit of Being frequently overcome thereby; or of drinking to Excess, so as to discompose and intoxicate your Mind. Alas, it is a sad, a pitiful, yea and most dangerous Case that you are in. For you are in very-deed, next Door to Ruin and Destruction; in the most ready way to be undone, Soul and Body for ever. There is utmost Danger, that this Sin will pre∣vail upon you, and that you will hence∣forward wax worse and worse. Yea ex∣cept you rouse up, and take the most carnest Heed to yourselves; yours is a gone Case; a dreadful Pit that you are fallen into; an almost inextricable Snare that you are intangied in. O that you would yet come to yourselves, look about you, and think in carnest, what are the certain fearful and dreadful Consequences of a Course of Intemperance, Surfeiting and Drunkenness. Thereby, your Powers are soon impaired, your good Name ruin'd your Honour lost, your Follies exposed, yourselves made a Scorn and a Derision, your Estates im∣poverished, your Families injured and
<PB N="23" REF="006862_0023_102A7ED3CD176120"/>wronged, the Welfare of your Souls ne∣glected God, dishonoured and provoked, Wrath treasured up against the Day of Wrath, and your Souls ripened in Guilt and Pollution, for an evelasting Destruction. And alas, can one that has the Reason and Spirit of a Man, carelesly plunge himself into all these deplorable Calamities; for the sake of gratifying, a worse than beastly Gust and Appetite? Can the intoxicating Draught, be dearer to you than your own Life and Health, dearer to you than your Manhood, than your Honour, than your good Name, and dearer to you than all the Comforts of Life, than your Estates, than your Wives, than your Husbands, and than your Children? That all must be hazarded to Ruin, to gratify a filthy Lust. Or can any of you, be so void of Humanity, so lost to all Sense of Honour, and to all Sense of Shame, as to let none of these Things move you? Alas, alas, all that is worthily dear to you in the World; your Health, your good Name, your Estates, your Families, your Wives, your
<PB N="24" REF="006862_0024_102A7ED609E1F010"/>Children, and all your Dear Friends, lament after you, and bewail with bitter Sighs and Moans, the fatal Ruin, you are bringing upon yourselves and upon them! And yet must they all be disregarded and spurned from you with Disdain? Alas, can you so divest yourself, of all the tenderest Ties of Nature; as to rend from the com∣passionate Embraces, and Heart melting En∣treaties, of your dear Partener, dissolved in Tears, and trample your weeping Friends, and smiling Babes, as under your Feet; to pursue the Way to Ruin with Greedi∣ness? Or can you be so regardless, of the Honour and Glory of God; so Fearless of his Wrath and Displeasure; so regardless of his Favour and Blessing, and of the Everlasting Welfare of your own Souls? As to go on in Ways dishonouring to God; to provoke him to Wrath, and to pull down everlasting Destruction upon your own Heads; for the sake of indulging your selves, in the filthy short lived Pleasures of Surfeiting and Drunkenness. Oh take Warn∣ing poor intemperate Soul! For not only
<PB N="25" REF="006862_0025_102A7ED8F11B6170"/>Diseases, Poverty, Shame and Reproach, are pursuing close at your Heels in this World: But the great and awful Day of Judgment will quickly overtake you. For which you are in the sure Way to be utterly unprepared; to have a most fear∣ful Account to give, and dreadful Doom to receive, from the Mouth of your great Judge. Who now says it in his Word and will make it good in that Day, <HI>that Drunkards shall not inherit the King∣dom of God.</HI> Wherefore for the Lord's Sake! And for your own precious Soul Sake! And for the Sake of all that is pre∣cious and dear to you, for Time and Eternity! Rouíe up and take Heed to yourselves that you keep at the greatest Distance from this Sin, wherewith you are most easily beset: Lest at any Time your Hearts be overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness, and swift Ruin and Destruction overtake you unawares. And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Be perswaded to break off your intemperate Indulgencies, and turn therefrom by unfeigned Repentance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="006862_0026_102A7EDA87DFCAF8"/>
Poison and Death are in your excessive Cups. And Judgement may soon overtake you; and then you are inevitably lost and undone for ever. But yet there is Mercy and Forgiveness with God thro' Jesus Christ, for all that repent and turn: Where∣fore be entreated seriously to consider the Folly and Evil of your Ways. Think what great Dishonour you have done to God; how you have abused his good Creatures, and consumed them upon your Lusts; and how greatly you have pro∣voked, your glorious Maker and Rightful Sovereign, to Wrath and Anger against you. Think how you have injured your own Sonk and what fearful Ruin you have laid yourselves open and exposed unto. And let the deepest Contrition, Bitterness and Sorrow fill your Hearts. Judge and Condemn yourselves, and bewail and la∣ment your past Excesses before God. And cry earnestly to him with Tears of un∣feigned Repentance; to be merciful unto you, to wash away your Guilt in the Blood of Jesus; and to cleanse you from all your
<PB N="27" REF="006862_0027_102A7EDD410DE5C0"/>woful Pollution, to mortify your Lusts, and to quicken and enable you by his Spirit and Grace, to keep under the Deeds of the Body, and to live in all Sobriety and Temperance. That if yet by his Grace you may be recovered out of the Snare in which you are taken, that your Souls may live and not die. And,</P>
<P><HI>Lastly, Be ye all warned and exhorted to watch and take Heed against Surfeiting and Drunkenness.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard what an insnaring, ruin∣ous and destructive Sin this is, to Soul and to Body, for Time and for Eternity. Wherefore take Warning and watch be∣times, against ever the least Degree of In∣temperance And be excited and entreated, as you tender all that is dear to you in the World, as you regard the Glory of God, as you dread his Wrath and Dis∣pleasure, and as you would escape ever∣lasting Destruction; most carefully to shun this Sin of Surfeiting and Drunkenness; and all the Temptations leading to it. Shun drinking Company, and avoid tipling Places,
<PB N="28" REF="006862_0028_102A7EE02D96A780"/>as most dangerous Snares laid for your Ruin. And beware of Excessive Cups as you would of the most deadly Poison: For remember; that although the Taste seem sweet and pleasant, the certain Effects are fatal Destruction. But put on Sobriety and Temperance at all Times. And make it your great Concern so to walk as may redown to God's Glory, your own present Peace and eternal Welfare. And as for yourselves, so also beware, for the Lord's sake and for the Soul sake of your Neigh∣bour, that you be not the Occasion, for filthy Lucre sake, of administring to the Intemperance of others. For such have a great Share in the Guilt of the intemperate and Drunken. <HI>Wo</HI> therefore is <HI>to him that giveth his Neighbour Drink: that putteth his Bottle to him, and maketh him Drunken also, that he may look on their Nakedness.</HI> Hab. 11.15. Wherefore take Heed and Warch over yourselves, and one over a∣nother; lest being overcharged with Sur∣feiting and Drunkenness; the great Day of the Lord overtake you unawares and
<PB N="29" REF="006862_0029_102A7EE2F4707BF8"/>unprepared. <HI>For ye are not in Darkness, that that Day shall overtake you as a Thief. Therefore let us not Sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.</HI> And to conclude.</P>
<P>Receive that Exhortation of the Apostle. Rom. xiii. 12, 14. <HI>The Night is far spent, the Day is at Hand: let us therefore cast off the Works of Darkness, and let us put on the Armour of Light. Let us walk honestly as in the Day; not in Rioting and Drunkenness, not in Chambering and Wantonness, not in Strife and Envying. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the Lust thereof.</HI> Amen.</P>
