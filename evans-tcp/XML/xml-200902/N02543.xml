<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very serious and awful <HI>Sermon</HI> here presented to the <HI>Reader,</HI> seems to have been prepar'd and utter'd, as it was also received, by a great and good <HI>Audience,</HI> under a reverend Regard to those <HI>Words</HI> of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timo∣thy, These things command and teach, let no man despise thy Youth.</HI> It is a pleasure to every at∣tentive <HI>Observer</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> at this day, to see with what Gravity and <HI>Authority</HI> the <HI>rising Ministers</HI> among us bring the solemn Warnings and Messages of CHRIST to his Churches, and with what <HI>Re∣verence</HI> they are heard. And doubtless it has been a pleasure to many in some late <HI>Lectures</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> preached by the <HI>Author</HI> of the fol∣lowing <HI>Discourse,</HI> to see the Name and Spirit of the famous JOHN COTTON revive and shine in this his <HI>great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> in Whom and in his worthy <HI>Brethren</HI> among us, may GOD please still further to build the House of his <HI>Servant,</HI> and speak Good to his <HI>Churches</HI> here for times to come.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="003015_0004_0FEF9F5A9FAB8B40"/>
THis is the <HI>second Essay</HI> of the Rev. <HI>Author,</HI> since the great and terrible EARTHQUAKE, which surpris'd and astonish'd us on the 29 of <HI>October</HI> last, (the <HI>Tremors</HI> consequent upon, which do continue to this Day) by the Will and Blessing of GOD to fasten sutable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on the hearts of fearing <HI>Saints</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sinners;</HI> and to <HI>warn</HI> those of some more dreadful <HI>Stroke</HI> from the Hand of an angry GOD, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to continue in their provoking Impenitence.</P>
<P>AND certainly the whole Story of GOD'S righ∣teous Judgments through the <HI>Holy Bible</HI> admo∣nishes us of <HI>this,</HI> from the days of <HI>Noah</HI> to <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI>'s second desolation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Old World</HI> was endured and waited on by the <HI>Long suffering</HI> of GOD, for how many Ages, under the Warnings of <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> but at last <HI>the Fountains of the great Deep were bro∣ken up</HI> to overwhelm them. They saw the <HI>Ark</HI> building, they were told <HI>for what,</HI> but they carelesly and obstinately <HI>quenched the striving</HI> SPIRIT of GOD; and the <HI>Flood</HI> came and drown'd 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Sodom</HI> afterward sinned against the <HI>Means of Grace</HI> in the Nei'bourhood of <HI>Melchisedek</HI> and <HI>Abraham,</HI> and when they would not be reformed by the Doctrine, Example, and Re∣proofs of those <HI>Holy Men of</HI> GOD, but gave themselves over to the fire of lust, the <HI>Fire of</HI> GOD fell upon them and consumed them.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="003015_0004_0FEF9F5A9FAB8B40"/>
So it far'd with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Canaanites. A∣braham</HI> and the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> were sent among them, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sojourners,</HI> to enlighten, teach, re∣prove and warn them: <HI>Melchizedeck</HI> and his religious People <HI>dwelt</HI> among them: The <HI>Can∣dlestick</HI> seems to be removed when <HI>Jacob</HI> went down into <HI>Egypt:</HI> Then the <HI>Iniquity of the Amorites filled</HI> apace, and they were rooted out by the Sword of the LORD and of <HI>Joshua.</HI></P>
<P>THE Story of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> would be too long to enter on: What <HI>Means of Grace</HI> they were distinguish'd with; How <HI>loth</HI> the HOLY ONE was to make them as <HI>Admah</HI> and set them as <HI>Zeboim;</HI> How often <HI>his Repentings kindled together;</HI> But their Overthrow was at last with a Vengeance <HI>greater</HI> (as the <HI>Prophet</HI> tho't) <HI>than the Punishment of Sodom, which pe∣rished in a moment, and no hand stayed on her.</HI></P>
<P>WE now are like Instances and Monuments of the <HI>Patience</HI> and Longsuffering of CHRIST, striving with us by his awakening SPIRIT, un∣der the <HI>Ministry</HI> of his Word, and the <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> of his Providence; And because the common and <HI>ordinary Means</HI> have had so little power and effect on us, GOD has used <HI>One</HI> al∣together <HI>new</HI> and extraordinary. He hath <HI>roar'd out of Zion</HI> in a way that we never heard before; even out of the <HI>bowels</HI> of the Earth, and as from the very <HI>belly of hell,</HI> we have heard his terrible <HI>Voice;</HI> like <HI>the Trum∣pet from the burning and shaking Mountain,</HI> at
<PB N="iv" REF="003015_0005_0FEF9F5D22C30470"/>the sound whereof very one in the <HI>Camp</HI> trem∣bled &amp;<HI>quaked,</HI> even <HI>Moses</HI> himself; Who warns us to <HI>take heed to our selves &amp; keep our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> diligent∣ly, lest we forget the Things which our Eyes have seen, and lest they depart from our Hearts all the days of our life.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Judgment</HI> is a great <HI>Deep.</HI> From what a <HI>depth</HI> below, did this <HI>Blast</HI> of GOD come? Six hundred Leagues off GOD shook the <HI>Islands</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">BARBADOS and MARTINECO.</NOTE> in the midst of the <HI>Ocean</HI> one day, to their great Terror; and this vast <HI>Continent</HI> (as it were) the next! Who has an <HI>Arm</HI> like this? or a like <HI>thundring</HI> Voice! What a length of <HI>Sea</HI> is there between us and <HI>Barbados?</HI> and yet it may be one and the same <HI>Blow</HI> (but pro∣bably not the same) set <HI>Them</HI> and <HI>Us,</HI> and the deep <HI>Waters</HI> between us, a trembling all at once. <HI>Ships</HI> sailing on the mighty <HI>Deep</HI> felt the <HI>Shock,</HI> and stay'd and <HI>shiver'd</HI> in their Course; the <HI>Mariners</HI> supposing that they had struck upon some <HI>Whale.</HI> At this may our hearts well <HI>tremble, and be moved out of</HI> their <HI>place.</HI> With GOD <HI>is terrible Majesty</HI> and Might Say unto Him, <HI>"How terrible art Thou in thy doings to the Children of Men! The Waters saw thee, O</HI> GOD <HI>!the Waters saw thee! the Depths also were troubled! the Earth trembled and shook! Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the great Waters</HI> (and underneath them) <HI>and thy footsteps are not known! Thou art the</HI> GOD
<PB N="v" REF="003015_0005_0FEF9F5D22C30470"/><HI>that doest Wonders: Thou hast declared thy Strength unto thy People</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm 77. ult.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN all this <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> and great <HI>Ter∣ror</HI> GOD passes before Men in fearful EARTH∣QUAKES; and the Meaning of his Providence is to awaken in guilty Sinners a <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>dread</HI> of his <HI>Wrath</HI> and righteous <HI>Judgment.</HI> This therefore is the <HI>Design</HI> of the following <HI>Sermon,</HI> which answers the Mind of the HOLY GHOST in the following <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Job 9.5, &amp;c. 26.11, &amp;c. Isai 13. Psal. 60</NOTE> <HI>Scripture</HI> passages. <Q><HI>He removeth the Mountains and they know it not, He overturneth them in bis Anger: He shak∣eth the Earth out of her place, and the Pillars thereof tremble. He looketh on the Earth and it trembleth; He toucheth the Hills and they smoke. He doeth great things past finding out, and Wonders without number. They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at his Tokens. He divideth the Sea by his Power, and by his Understanding He smiteth thro' the proud. With an overflowing Flood he will make an utter End, and darkness shall pursue his Enemies. — "Howl ye for the Day! it shall come as a Destruction from the Almighty: All hands shall be faint and every Man's heart shall melt: Pangs and Sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be amazed one at another, their Faces shall be as flames: And I will pu∣nish the World for their Evil, and the Wicked for their Iniquity: I will shake the Heavens,
<PB N="vi" REF="003015_0006_0FEF9F60D7A21838"/>and the Earth shall remove out of her place, in the Wrath of the</HI> LORD <HI>of Hosts, and in the day of his fierce Anger.</HI></Q></P>
<P>BUT we remain <HI>escaped</HI> this day, the Monu∣ments of Divine <HI>Patience,</HI> and let us <HI>fear the</HI> LORD <HI>and his Goodness;</HI> be driven and led to <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> by all his <HI>Terrors</HI> and his greater <HI>Mer∣cies, of which it is that we are not consumed.</HI></P>
<P>NOR let us fail to insert our solemn thank∣ful <HI>Praises</HI> to GOD for those <HI>Tokens of</HI> SAVING MERCY which are upon many of his People thro' the <HI>Land,</HI> since this awakning <HI>Providence.</HI> If <HI>these</HI> continue our <HI>Mourning</HI> will be turned into <HI>Songs</HI> of Thanksgiving.</P>
<P>YET this also should be <HI>humbling</HI> to us, that there should need an horrible EARTHQUAKE to bring us to CHRIST and to his <HI>Table !</HI> that we should need this <HI>shaking</HI> of the Earth un∣der us, to make us <HI>spring in trembling,</HI> like the <HI>Jailour.</HI></P>
<P>NEVER the less I trust that as to the far greater part of Those who are now joyning themselves to the <HI>Churches</HI> of CHRIST among us, the <HI>Earthquake</HI> has only been a <HI>Means</HI> in the Hand of GOD to <HI>awaken</HI> and bring into Act, those <HI>Impressions,</HI> Desires and holy Pur∣poses, which the SPIRIT of GOD had before wro't in Them, by his <HI>Word</HI> and other <HI>Pro∣vidences.</HI> It has been <HI>thus</HI> in all the <HI>Admissi∣ons</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="003015_0006_0FEF9F60D7A21838"/>I have acted in to this day; Else I should have had, much less pleasure in them. Where the Heart has been touch'd before under the <HI>Word</HI> and made <HI>render,</HI> there such a <HI>Providence</HI> is like to enter deep: Yea and where the Heart is <HI>Stone</HI> it should be eno to <HI>break the Rock in pieces.</HI></P>
<P>LET us deprecate the <HI>going off</HI> of these A∣waknings without a saving Effect; lest our hearts like <HI>glowing Iron suddenly drench'd in Water</HI> be doubly <HI>hardned.</HI></P>
<P>BUT let those especially be warned of their <HI>Danger</HI> who have been little affected, alarm'd and mov'd by such a <HI>Threatning</HI> of sudden De∣struction. <Q><HI>Nay,</HI> may the Sinners <HI>below</HI> be ready to say, <HI>"but if the Earth open before them, and threaten to swallow them up, they will repent!</HI></Q> But alas! even <HI>this</HI> will not do where Men <HI>will not hear</HI> CHRIST in the Ministry of his Word. — Beware lest <HI>that</HI> come upon you which is written, <Q><HI>Behold ye Despisers! and wonder and perish: after the Work that I have wro't in your days.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Daniel</HI> stood astonish'd under the <HI>Visions</HI> of GOD's fearful Judgments, he cried out, <Q><HI>O my Lord,</HI> What shall be the End of these things? The Answer was, <HI>"Go thy way,</HI></Q> — <HI>Many shall be purified and made white, but the wicked shall do wickedly.</HI> We must leave the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> both <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to particular

<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> Danger of not obeying the Voice of GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ZEPHANIAH III. 2, 7, 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>SHE obeyed not the Voice: she received not Correction: she trusted not in the LORD: she drew not near to her GOD. I said, surely thou wilt fear me: thou wilt receive Instruction: so their dwellings should not be out off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early and cor∣rupted all their doings. Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my Determination is — to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce Anger, for all the Earth shall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealousie.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINCE whatsoever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learn∣ing, i. e. for our <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Ad∣monition</HI> on whom the Ends of the World are come, it certainly, greatly concerns us to hear Counsel, and receive Instruction, by the Calls of GOD, and to take Warning
<PB N="2" REF="003015_0008_0FEF9F64D406BD50"/>by the Denunciations of His Wrath against His <HI>Covenant professing People</HI> in former Ages of the World: By doing so, we should make a wise and good Improvement of the Lord's terrible Dispensations towards them. Would to GOD, we might be enabled to such an Improve∣ment of the solemn Reproofs, and awful Warnings dispensed by the holy <HI>Prophet,</HI> who spake the Words I have now read: He was sent from GOD, was authoriz'd and commis∣sion'd by Him, to reprove sharply, all Ranks and Orders of Men, for their Sins; for their Idolatry, Apostacy, Forgetfulness of GOD, and their Duty, and the sinful Fashions of too many in their Habits, and the violent Op∣pressions of many, which with many other provoking Evils were found in the midst of them, and were abounding among them, for which they were threatned with severe Pu∣nishments, yea, and with an utter Desolation, with the like Desolation that had been brought on other Nations and People, not far from them; these terrible Examples the <HI>Prophet</HI> sets before them, to move and excite them to consider, repent, and amend their Ways, and so prevent the Infliction of threatned Judg∣ments, which without such a Repentance and Reformation, would certainly, and suddenly be brought upon them. The <HI>Prophet</HI> there∣fore does most affectionately exhort and urge them to Repentance, by the Examples of those whose Impenitence added to their Ini∣quities ruin'd them.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003015_0008_0FEF9F64D406BD50"/>
BY many gracious Promises and Encourag∣ments, He excites them to look and hope for Mercy, upon their hearkening to His Coun∣sel, that He would then preserve a <HI>Remnant</HI> of them, amidst all the wasting Calamities and Judgments, that should follow them, who should rejoice in the GOD of their Salvation, because GOD would in the midst of Judgment remember Mercy for them.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of this <HI>Prophesy</HI> is foretold the approaching Desolation of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem; I will utterly consume all Things from off the Land, saith the Lord: I will con∣sume Man and Beast, I will also stretch out mine Hand upon Judah, and upon all the Inha∣bitants of Jerusalem.</HI> It intimates that by some immediate and awful Stroke of His holy Hand, He would bring a dreadful Destruction upon them, and not only upon the idolatrous Wor∣shippers of the Host of Heaven, but upon such as <HI>have turned back from the Lord, and those that have not sought the Lord the Lord, nor en∣quired after Him:</HI> i. e. Such as have forsaken the Lord and His pure Worship, or that have turned <HI>Atheists;</HI> in their Hearts say, and by their Practices declare, <HI>That there is no GOD,</HI> and therefore will not call upon His Name, nor stir up themselves to take hold of Him; such also are doom'd to Destruction.</P>
<P>THE Prophet then calls upon them in such awful Terms as these, <HI>Hold thy Peace at the Presence of the Lord GOD, for the Day of the Lord is at Hand, And it shall come to pass in
<PB N="4" REF="003015_0009_0FEF9F676F6529D8"/>that Day, that I will punish all such as are clothed with strange Aparrel.</HI> An Expositor says upon this Place <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pool.</NOTE>, That the wanton Jews were wont to imitate the Garb of Foreigners. They were doubtless some very indecent Fa∣shions, and it's probable very extravagant, that they run into, for which GOD so awful∣ly and particularly threatens to punish them. [But such Threatnings it's to be fear'd were not much regarded <HI>then,</HI> and will be very little <HI>now,</HI> by those who are most criminal and faulty in such Extravagance. It is sadly evident, there has been too much of it in almost every Town in the Land, as well as <HI>This;</HI> I wish those whom it most concerns, would consider seri∣ously of it, and so adorn themselves, as to prevent such an extravagant Expence, as too commonly attends some <HI>vain Ornaments.</HI> Tho' I don't think this to be the most crying Sin of this Land; yet I believe many who are so clothed, may do well to think seriously with themselves, whether notwithstanding this Threatning in my Context, and that al∣so in <HI>Isai.</HI> 3.18. which they may read at their Leisure, they can think themselves <HI>wholly without Blame?</HI> When GOD so solemnly and particularly threatens to punish for <HI>strange Aparrel,</HI> and speaks of a Day a coming, in which He will take away the <HI>bravery of some Ornaments,</HI> too much like those I am speaking of, I am sure, such as are serious and thoughtful, will be
<PB N="5" REF="003015_0009_0FEF9F676F6529D8"/>not a little concern'd, lest a holy GOD should be offended by their <HI>Excess</HI> in this Regard. I will conclude this Digression, with that sea∣sonable Exhortation to us all; 1 Tim. 2.8, 9. <HI>I will therefore that Men pray every where, lift∣ing up holy Hands, without Wrath and Doubting. In like Manner also, that Women adorn them∣selves in modest Aparrel, with shamefacedness and Sobriety, and not with costly Array, but (which becomes Women professing Godliness) with good Works.]</HI></P>
<P>I go on now to shew, What GOD foretells there shall be immediately after He had said, That He would punish such as were cloth'd with <HI>strange Aparrel; It shall come to pass in that Day, saith the Lord, that where shall be the Noise of a Cry, and an Howling, and a great crashing from the Hills;</HI> (probably, in a dread∣ful, tremendous EARTHQUAKE) which the Prophet says, should <HI>make them cry alo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and bitterly;</HI> then the Lord declares, <HI>He will punish the Men that are settled on their Lees:</HI> Such as were always deaf to the Voice of GOD by His Word and Judgments, and refus'd to receive Correction, would not be reform'd by all the dreadful Judgments of GOD, but went on in∣corrigibly in their evil Ways; such shall be now severely punish'd, and made to see and know, that there is a GOD that judges in the Earth, and that it shall be <HI>well with the Righ∣teous, and ill with the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P>THE Prophet goes on and declares, <HI>The great Day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth
<PB N="6" REF="003015_0010_0FEF9F69EF6BA9E8"/>greatly, even the Voice of the Day of the Lord, the mighty Man shall cry bitterly:</HI> The most va∣liant, and stout hearted, their Hearts shall in that Day fail them for Fear, of what may be coming upon them: Their <HI>Flesh shall</HI> now <HI>tremble for Fear of GOD, and they shall be</HI> now <HI>afraid of His Judgments: Fearfulness and Trem∣lling will now come upon them, which will make all their Bones to shake;</HI> and <HI>Destruction from the Lord, shall be a Teyyor to them,</HI> so that their Outcries shall be very vehement, there will be <HI>Bitterness of Heart, and bitter Wailing;</HI> for that Day, the <HI>Prophet</HI> says in the next Verse, will be a <HI>Day of Wrath, a Day of Trouble and Distress, a Day of Wastness and Desolation, a Day of Darkness and Gloominess, a Day of Clouds and thick Darkness.</HI> The <HI>Pro∣phet</HI> here heaps up Words of much the same Sense, to express the grievousness of those Troubles, that should suddenly come upon them, most distressing Troubles, none knowing how to bear them, or where to hide from them. In the <HI>next Verse</HI> but one, he says, <HI>I will bring Distress upon Men, because they have sinned against the Lord;</HI> because their Sins have been many and greatly aggravated, and so the more provoking to Me; He then de∣clares that neither <HI>their Silver, nor their Gold shall he able to deliver them in the Day of the Lord's Wrath; but the whole Land shall be devoured by the Fire of His Jealousy, for He shall make even a speedy Riddance of all them that dwell in the Land:</HI> They must now feel
<PB N="7" REF="003015_0010_0FEF9F69EF6BA9E8"/>the terrible Impressions of the Wrath of a righ∣teous Judge, for their Sins; that Fire being kindled thereby, that none could quench: Though GOD had with wonderful Patience waited and born with them, He would now wait no longer, but speedily execute His ter∣rible Threatnings of Wrath upon them.</P>
<P>THE holy Prophet now earnestly exhorts them to Repentance before the threatned Judgments should be inflicted; he therefore thus calls upon them, <HI>Gather your selves toge∣ther, yea, gather together, O Nation n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> desired, call a solemn Assembly, proclaim a Fast;</HI> Let all the People know of it, and when assem∣bled, search your selves, your Hearts and Ways, and <HI>Repent:</HI> It was repeated, it's pro∣bable, to affect them the more, and quicken them to their Duty and make them more se∣rious, and in good earnest in the Work of <HI>Re∣pentance. O Nation not desired!</HI> Not desirous of returning to GOD, though you have fall'n by your Iniquities; unwilling to return, and unworthy of being received upon your Return: Yet gather together, and do what you possibly can for your Safety; <HI>before the Decree bring forth, before the Day pass as the Chaff, before the fierce Anger of the Lord come upon you, be∣fore the Day of the Lord's Anger coure upon you:</HI> GOD is just ready to bring down de∣served Vengeance upon you, be therefore speedy in your Repentance, before the terri∣ble Day arrives, the Day of His righteous Displeasure, which will carry the wicked a∣way,
<PB N="8" REF="003015_0011_0FEF9F6BC96578C8"/>as the Wind carries the Chaff away for the Fire, while the good Grain shall be gather'd and preserv'd. It is here call'd <HI>fierce</HI> Anger, which means the heat of GOD's Anger; In the <HI>first Chapter,</HI> It is call'd, <HI>Jealousy like Fire,</HI> and here it's call'd the <HI>Heat</HI> of that <HI>Fire,</HI> in∣timating the greatness of GOD's Anger: It shall come upon you, as a Storm, with irresis∣table and destructive Violence, and the Wain∣ing is doubled to make them take the more Notice of it.</P>
<P>HE then calls upon the <HI>Meek of the Earth to seek the Lord, to seek Righteousness, and Meekness,</HI> for it may be, <HI>they should be hid in the Day of the Lord's Anger.</HI> He calls on them thus to seek for pardoning Mercy, and en∣gage in a Course of Obedience to the Laws of GOD, to seek the Knowledge of GOD, and their Duty, and comply therewith; to fear and serve the great GOD. But mind, 'tis the <HI>bumble</HI> that are here call'd on, such as had not harden'd themselves in Wickedness, as other stubborn, proud, idolatrous Sinners had done; he seems to call on such who trem∣bled at GOD's Word, and at His Judgments, who had some Year and Concern of Soul a∣bout their Danger and escaping his fiery In∣dignation; that they would humble them∣selves yet more under the mighty Hand of GOD, and hope in His Mercy, and wait on Him for His Salvation: It may be, you may be hid, this is sufficient to raise your Hope, peradventure the Lord will be <HI>gracious;</HI> if it
<PB N="9" REF="003015_0011_0FEF9F6BC96578C8"/>be not certain, yet it is not impossible, but that you may be hid under the Shadow of His Wings, in the Day of His Anger, be taken under His Care and Protection, and so <HI>have rest in the Day of Trouble;</HI> or have the threatned Calamities and Judgments averted.</P>
<P>HE further tells them, that it is high time to make GOD their Refuge, and repair to to Him as such; for their Neighbours as well as they should be destroyed, there should therefore be no Refuge for them among their Neighbours, that therefore if they would not fear the Lord, who is terrible in His Do∣ings, Desolation would quickly come upon them.</P>
<P>THE faithful Prophet therefore in the <HI>begin∣ning</HI> of this <HI>Chapter</HI> containing my Text, threatens them with destroying Judgments. <Q>From the dreadful Spectacle of <HI>Nineveh</HI>'s Ruin for her Sins, He would have them take a Prospect of what was coming upon <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which would also er'e long be full of Woes, because full of Sin.</Q> And in the Words I have read, He gives the Reasons for it; <Q><HI>She obeyed not the Voice,</HI> the Voice of the Law, or Prophets, of GOD's faithful Messengers, nor His Voice by His Mercy or Judgments, crying aloud, warning, in∣viting and perswading to return.</Q> <HI>She re∣ceived not Correction or Instruction,</HI> as it may be read; she did not learn, she would not be instructed; it indeed means more than is ex∣pressed, even that she <HI>hated Instruction,</HI> and
<PB N="10" REF="003015_0012_0FEF9F6ECACDE650"/>trusted not in the Lord, would not make Him her Refuge, or in Distress draw near to Him by Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>I said surely, thou wilt fear me;</HI> <Q>I thought or concluded (speaking after the Manner of Men) what I might justly expect, that af∣ter the many &amp; terrible Judgments executed upon others,</Q> which they have seen or heard of, they would fear so as to sin no more, lest the like come upon them. <HI>That they would</HI> <Q><HI>receive Instruction,</HI> learn their Duty and comply with it, their Danger, to prevent it, their Sins, that they might repent of them, their Ways, that they might amend them, that so their Dwellings might be pre∣served.</Q> <HI>Howsoever I</HI> might otherwise <HI>punish them,</HI> <Q>Whatever I had done against them, however I had chastised them, had they been bettered, humbled and amended, I would have spared, and not destroyed them utterly.</Q> <HI>But they rose early and corrupted all their Doings;</HI> <Q>They grew worse and worse, more eager in the Pursuit of their vile Courses; as if the Day would be too short for their Sins, they rise early and begin be∣times; they designedly and out of set Pur∣pose, did worse and worse, though they were smitten, yet they revolted more and more.</Q> <HI>Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the Day that I rise up to the Prey;</HI> Since you will not be reformed by all that I have already done unto you, but grow worse and worse; <Q>You that are thus stubborn
<PB N="11" REF="003015_0012_0FEF9F6ECACDE650"/>and incorrigible, both Rulers and People, attend to my Resolution, for I am resolved what I will do, and have set a Day for it, when as an Enemy I will come out of my Place, rise up against you, and by my Judg∣ments destroy you.</Q> <HI>For my Determination is to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce Anger;</HI> <Q>It is my fixed Purpose, that which I have unalterably resolv'd up∣on,</Q> to execute the Fierceness of mine Anger upon them, if they continue in their obstina∣cy and incorrigibleness, for this will inkindle mine Anger against them; <HI>for all the Earth shall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealousie;</HI> <Q>that Jealousie wherewith I am jealous for my own Glory, for my Statutes and Ordi∣nances, which they have notoriously vio∣lated.</Q></P>
<P>HAVING thus open'd and paraphras'd upon the Words; I might mention a Variety of useful Observations they afford unto us, and such as the Providence of GOD, at <HI>this Day,</HI> calls us to think much upon. I shall mention four.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>OBSERV. I.</HI>THE professing People of GOD, are too often chargeable with the Guilt of not obeying the Voice of GOD.</ITEM>

<HI>OBSERV. III.</HI> DID we so, we might hope to be saved from destroying Judgments, how∣ever otherwise GOD might punish us.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>OBSERV. IV.</HI> IF notwithstanding, we go on incorrigibly in our evil Ways, we may be assured, that GOD has determined to pour out His Indignation upon us, even all His fierce Anger, and even to devour the Earth with the Fire of His Jealousie.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THESE Observations, I think, ly plainly be∣fore us in the Text; I shall as the Time will allow speak to each of them. I begin with the first,</P>
<P><HI>OBSERV. I.</HI> THE professing People of GOD are too often chargeable with the Guilt of not obeying the Voice of the Lord.</P>
<P>THIS Charge was exhibited against GOD's Covenant professing People of old, and there is too much Reason to fear, it may be so, a∣gainst us His visible professing People now.</P>
<P>HERE I would say particularly,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>MULTITUDES do not obey the Voice of GOD by His written Word.</HI> Though the great Things of GOD's Law are written to is, yet by how many are they accounted as a strange thing; such is the Corruption and Wickedness in the Hearts of many, that they practically say to Almighty GOD, <HI>Depart from us, for we desire not the Knowledge of thy
<PB N="13" REF="003015_0013_0FEF9F71CF2F7F38"/>Ways; And, what is the Almighty, that we should serve Him &amp; obey His Voice?</HI> Their Hearts rise against a strict Observance of the pure and holy LawsofGOD, particularly, such as do most thwart their beloved Iniquities, which are as near and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them, as a <HI>right hand,</HI> and a <HI>right eye;</HI> and therefore they cannot tell how to hearken to the Call of CHRIST, to cut them oft, and pluck them out—; It is a <HI>hard Say∣ing,</HI> and they cannot tell how to bear it, and so persist in their Disobedience to all the Laws of GOD, though they are all holy, just, and good; so that they may now come before GOD, and make that <HI>Confession,</HI> in Dan. 9.5. <HI>We have sinned, and committed Ini∣quity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy Precepts, and from thy Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THERE are Multitudes among the pro∣fessing People of GOD, that do not obey His Voice by His Embassadors.</HI> And no wonder it is so, when the Voice of GOD by His written Word, is not hearkned to; from the very same Principle of Enmity to GOD and His holy Laws and Precepts, they will not hear∣ken to GOD's faithful Messengers; <HI>Though they cry aloud, and lift up their Voice like a Trumpet,</HI> when they would sound an Alarm to an impenitent and wicked World, and <HI>spare not</HI> faithfully to shew to such a People their <HI>Transgressions</HI> and their <HI>Sins,</HI> their Sins of <HI>O∣mission,</HI> and of <HI>Commission</HI> they indulge them∣selves
<PB N="14" REF="003015_0014_0FEF9F76A766CAC0"/>in, to the Dishonour of GOD, and en∣kindling His holy Anger and Displeasure a∣gainst them, that they must therefore confess and forsake them, though they have been ne∣ver so near and dear to them, even <HI>that,</HI> which they may have rowl'd as a sweet Mor∣sel under their Tongues, that they must else look for fiery Indignation and Wrath to de∣vour them: Yet how many of the professing People of GOD, such as are <HI>Christians</HI> in Name, and by Profession, when they are thus warned by the Messengers of the Lord, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, are ready to dislike such Messages and Warnings, they don't like to hear so much of them: Unto all such the great GOD com∣mands His Prophets; <HI>Isai.</HI> Ch. 30. from the 8.<HI>Verse,</HI> <Q>to go and write it before them in a Table, and note it in a Book, that it may be for Time to come, for ever and ever; that this is a rebellious People, lying Children, Chil∣dren that will not hear the Law of the Lord, which say to the Seers, see not, and to the Prophets, prophesy not unto us right Things, speak unto us smooth Things, pro∣phesy Deceits, get you out of the Way, turn aside out of the Path, cause the holy One of Israel <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from before us.</Q> The Disobedience of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o many to the Voice of GOD, is too often sadly evident, by their despising the Words, and even the Messengers of GOD themselves; this was a provoking Sin found among GOD's professing People of
<PB N="15" REF="003015_0014_0FEF9F76A766CAC0"/>old, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36.15, 16. <HI>The Lord God of their Fathers, sent unto them by His Messengers, rising up betimes, and sending them, because he had Compassion on his People. But they mocked the Messengers of GOD, and despised his Words, and misused His Prophets;</HI> so that they had Rea∣son to cry out, as in <HI>Nehem.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Hear O GOD, for we are despised.</HI> When the faithful Mes∣sages of GOD by His Servants are disregard∣ed, such do not obey the Voice of the Lord, and have Reason in their <HI>Humiliations</HI> and <HI>Confessions</HI> before GOD from one Time to another, to say, as in <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.6, 10. <HI>Neither have we hearkned to thy Servants the Prophets, which spake in thy Name, neither have we obey'd the Voice of the Lord our GOD, to walk in His Laws which He set before us, by His Servants the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THERE are too many that do not obey the Voice of GOD by His Judgments inflicted, or threatned.</HI> Though there be a Voice of GOD, and a <HI>mighty Voice,</HI> in all such Judg∣ments, both to <HI>the Town,</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> especi∣ally when the Great GOD does by His <HI>Voice shake the Wilderness,</HI> and threaten to bury us, and our Houses, and all we have, in the <HI>deep Places of the Earth,</HI> from whence His Voice has come with a <HI>dreadful Sound in our Ears;</HI> yet are there not too many, that do not so hearken even to this <HI>awful Voice,</HI> as they should, or else they would have sear'd and trembl'd more before that GOD, who so ter∣ribly <HI>roared out of Zion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003015_0015_0FEF9F785587D358"/>
Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>MANY do not obey the Voice of GOD by His Mercies.</HI> There is a Voice in these, as well as in His Judgments. The Goodness and Mercy of GOD to us in the various Instances of it, do call, and should lead us to Repen∣tance, as well as His judicial Dispensations. The innumerable Favours of GOD vouchsafed to us do call upon us to love, and serve, and live devoted to the GOD, who is so loading us with His Benefits; all signal Preservations do yet more especially do so; Preservations from <HI>Thunder</HI> and <HI>Lightning, Storms</HI> and <HI>Tem∣pests,</HI> and <HI>terrible Earthquakes,</HI> in a particular Manner, which might, and so often have prov'd fatal and destructive unto Multitudes. How many populous Places have been de∣stroyed by the amazing <HI>Judgment</HI> of the <HI>Eartk∣quake,</HI> and Multitudes swallowed up quick in the Pit, while the Lord has only shaken the Earth under us, and no Damage done, either to Man or Beast: So marvellous has been the Deliverance and Salvation granted to us; But may it not be fear'd, that many have not duly hearkned to the Voice of GOD in such a remarkable Deliverance, have not been duly thankful to GOD for it, and concern'd to answer His Expectations in so sparing them? Such as have not had a due Sollicitude of Soul about this, may be said, not to obey the Voice of the Lord.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>MANY do not obey the Voice of the Lord by His Spirit.</HI> Though the Spirit of GOD does
<PB N="17" REF="003015_0015_0FEF9F785587D358"/>many Times by His secret Motions, convince Men of their Sloth and Negligence as to the great Concerns of their Souls, and Eternity, and their utter Unpreparedness for Death and Judgment, and does sometimes evidently ex∣cite them to enquire, as the <HI>Jaylour</HI> did after the <HI>Earthquake, What must I do to be saved?</HI> And so to <HI>seek the Lord, while He may be sound, and to call on Him, while He is near,</HI> and to <HI>work out their Salvation with Fear and Trem∣bling,</HI> and delay doing it no longer; yet how many do not cherish and pursue such Convic∣tions? Yea, Do not too many knowingly op∣pose and resist the striving Spirit of GOD, thus at work upon their Hearts, and thereby make it evident, at least to themselves, that they do not obey the Voice of GOD?</P>
<P>I might say again,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>MANY do not obey the Voice of GOD by their own Consciences.</HI> Though their enlight∣ned Consciences are so far awakned, as to do their Office upon them, and charge home Guilt lying on them, with respect either to Omissions of Duty, or Commissions of Evil, or both, they have allow'd themselves in; Tho' their <HI>Consciences</HI> do sometimes suggest to them, they have gone on in foolish and hurtful Ways, to the Dishonour of GOD, and the wounding of their Souls and Bodies, <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Estate,</HI> and thereby laid in for a bitter Repentance, and that there must be sooner or later a <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> and a more holy circumspect Liv∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="003015_0016_0FEF9F7AE7DF7560"/>and Walking than there has ever yet been; yet have not many persisted in their evil Ways under and after such evident Convictions &amp; Ad∣monitions from their own Consciences? all such do not obey the Voice of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Finally, IF we don't receive Correction, and trust in the Lord, and draw near to our GOD, we do not obey His Voice.</HI> If we do not chear∣fully submit to the Discipline of His Rod, acknowledge His Justice and Righteousness in His judicial Dispensations, and set upon cor∣recting the Errors of our Lives, and then re∣pair to GOD, as the Hope of His People, and their Saviour in the Day of Trouble, and call upon Him in such a Day: In short, If we are not brought nearer to GOD by His aw∣ful Visitations, if we don't become more prayerful than ever, we are chargeable with the Guilt of not obeying the Voice of the Lord; and may it not be fear'd, that many are in these Respects, guilty before GOD, for which He may be justly angry with them?</P>
<P>BUT so much for the first Observation. I proceed to the second.</P>
<P><HI>OBSERV. II.</HI> GOD may justly expect that we fear Him, and receive Instruction by His Judgments.</P>
<P><HI>I said, surely, Thou wilt fear me, then wilt receive Instruction.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003015_0016_0FEF9F7AE7DF7560"/>
THE judgments of GOD have a wonderful Tendency to excite us to <HI>fear</HI> and tremble before Him, and He always sends them, or threatens the Infliction of them to excite a holy Fear of Him in the Hearts of His Peo∣ple, and when they don't attain this End, He complains of such a People, and exhibits that awful Charge against them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.10. <HI>They are not humbled, even unto this Day, neither have they feared. Fear</HI> is sometimes put for religious Worship, and sometimes for the whole of Religion, but here in my Text, 'tis probable, it may be rather taken for that Pas∣sion, or Affection of the Mind called <HI>Fear.</HI> There should be a holy Fear of GOD and His Wrath, a Trembling at His Judgments: We read, Psal. 65.8. <HI>They that dwell in the utter∣most Parts are afraid at thy Tokens.</HI> The holy Psalmist says, Psal. 119.120. <HI>My Flesh trem∣bleth for Fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> And the holy Prophet <HI>Habakkuk, Chap.</HI> 3.16. <HI>When I heard, my Belly trembled, my Lips quivered, I trembled in my self.</HI> GOD ex∣pects that we fear, and tremble before Him, under the Apprehensions of present, and im∣pending Dispensations of His Wrath, but more especially under the Sense of whatsoever provoking Evils have enkindled His Displea∣sure, and caused Him to shake His Rod over us. We read, Ezra 9.4. <HI>How they assembled every one that trembled at the Words of the Lord,</HI> because of the Transgressions of His People, and how the <HI>Prophet sat astonied until the even∣ing
<PB N="20" REF="003015_0017_0FEF9F7CBABC3D58"/>Sacrifice:</HI> And in the <HI>next Chap.</HI> How <HI>all the People sat in the House of GOD trembling because of this Matter.</HI> So <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> that ex∣cellent <HI>Governour, feared</HI> upon the Threatning of a terrible Judgment, and <HI>set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fast throughout all Judab.</HI> When GOD sends His Judgments they are to excite in us a reveren<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Fear of Him, and awful Dread of His Wrach. Hence under the Judgments of GOD, that is the Call of GOD unto us, <HI>Isai.</HI> 8.13. <HI>Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself, and let Him be your Fear, and let Him be your Dread.</HI></P>
<P>AND as the Lord may expect to be <HI>feared,</HI> (for when the <HI>Lyon roars, who will not fear,</HI> we shall be more stupid than the Beasts of the Field, if we tremble not,) so may He justly expect that we <HI>hear and receive Instruction</HI> thereby, that we learn to adore and magnify His infinite and almighty Power, together with His undeserved sparing Mercy, that we see how much it concerns us to make the Lord our Refuge, and to get under the Sha∣dow of His Wings, that we may not perish in the Day of His Indignation, that being warn∣ed of GOD as <HI>Noah</HI> was, we may prepare an Ark, in which we may be saved from being overwhelmed with the Floods of divine Ven∣geance, that may come down in an horrible Tempest upon a wicked World: That we therefore make haste to CHRIST, that we may have Rest in such a Day of Trouble. GOD may justly expect, that we do in these Re∣gards
<PB N="21" REF="003015_0017_0FEF9F7CBABC3D58"/><HI>Fear Him, and receive Instruction.</HI> This is GOD's great End and Design in threatning to bring down His awful Judgments on us, and they are a loud Call to all to fear Him, and to tremble at His Presence; to give Glory to His Name, <HI>to publish His Name,</HI> as <HI>Moses</HI> speaks, by <HI>ascribing Praise to our GOD,</HI> and then to learn all those Lessons, such Dispensations call us to. GOD has implanted this Affection or Passion of the Mind in us, to be exerted up∣on proper Objects being presented to us, and all those Dispensations that carry Terror in them, may well work upon our Fears, unless our Hearts be harder than the Rocks and Mountains that <HI>quake at Him, and are thrown down by Him.</HI> And He has made us capable of receiving Instruction, of thinking on our Ways, of <HI>remembring this, and shewing our selves Men,</HI> unless we will be like <HI>the Horse and Mule which have no Understanding.</HI></P>
<P>WE have many desirable Helps and Ad∣vantages for the knowing our Lord's Mind and Will, if we are truly desirous of doing it. So then we must certainly conclude, That GOD may justly expect, that we <HI>fear Him, and receive Instruction.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER He has inflicted any Judgments on us, or threaten'd the Infliction of more and greater, He may well say concerning such a People; <HI>Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive Instruction.</HI></P>
<P>I pass to the third Observation.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="003015_0018_0FEF9F7F54E1EAB0"/>
<HI>OBSERV. III.</HI> THAT did we fear the Lord, and receive Instruction, we might hope to be saved from destroying Judgments; so that our Dwellings should not be cut off, however otherwise GOD might punish us.</P>
<P>WE should by <HI>fearing</HI> the Lord, and <HI>receiv∣ing Instruction</HI> answer His righteous Expecta∣tions concerning us, and so remove the Grounds of His Controversy with us. When GOD brings His Judgments upon a People, or threat∣ens to dispense terrible Things in Righteous∣ness to them, it is because they will not <HI>fear</HI> Him, will not lay His Judgments to Heart, and see and own their Sin and Folly in their vile Departures from Him, and therefore He will make them to feel the doleful Effects of His vindictive Wrath: So much we plainly learn from the Tenour of the divine Threat∣nings throughout the Book of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT now if the People of GOD under His Judgments inflicted or threatned, maintain a holy Fear of GOD upon their Hearts, and give to GOD the Glory of His divine Perfec∣tions therein display'd, and acknowledge His Sovereignty, Justice, and Mercy, in His Dis∣pensations, and make it their sollicitous inqui∣ry, <HI>What meaneth the Heat of His Anger? What have I done, and how much have I provok∣ed the holy GOD to come out of His Place, and threaten even on utter Desolation? I will now therefore search and try my Ways, and by the Help of His Grace will now turn unto the Lord, that
<PB N="23" REF="003015_0018_0FEF9F7F54E1EAB0"/>He may have Mercy upon me, and pardon me, and not execute the Fierceness of His Anger.</HI> Were this our great Sollicitude under the threat∣ning Visitations of GOD, we should have com∣fortable Grounds of Hope, that the Lord would stay His Hand, and spare us, in the Multitude of His tender Mercies; yea, that He woud repent Him of what further Evil He had thought to have brought upon us. Such a repenting and returning GOD, has assured us, will keep off, or avert impending Judg∣ments: Hence after the holy Prophet <HI>Joel</HI> had in terrible Manner spake of GOD's utter∣ing His Voice, in the Day that should be <HI>great</HI> and <HI>terrible,</HI> and <HI>none could abide it:</HI> He im∣mediately exhorts in the Name of the Lord, <HI>to turn unto the Lord,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joel 2.12, 13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>Therefore also now saith the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your Heart, and with Fasting, and with Weeping, and with Mourning, and rent your Hearts, and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your GOD: for He is gracious and merciful, slow to Anger, and of great Kindness, and repenteth Him of the Evil.</HI></P>
<P>IT is spoken after the Manner of Men, to represent how ready the Lord is upon a <HI>sin∣cere Repentance,</HI> and <HI>thorow Reformation,</HI> to change the Course of His Providence towards His People, and not inflict those Judgments, He threatned to bring down upon them; yea, He further says, <HI>Then will the Lord be jealous
<PB N="24" REF="003015_0019_0FEF9F8262E13300"/>for His Land, and pity His People, yea, the Lord will answer, Fear not, O Land! Be glad and rejoice, for the Lord will do great Things, and I will pour out my Spirit</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN a Word here; GOD has often spared His People, upon their thus returning to Him; He has upon their Humiliations and Interces∣sions granted them a Reprieve, and so He is ready to do still; if we will also <HI>fear Him and receive Instruction.</HI> Hence we have that Warn∣ing from the Lord, Jer. 6.8. <HI>Be thou instruc∣ted O Jerusalem, lest my Soul depart from thee, lest I make thee Desolate, a Land not inhabited.</HI> Be thou <HI>instructed</HI> or <HI>corrected,</HI> as it may be read; By the Correction thou hast felt alrea∣dy, and which is further threatned, be per∣swaded to repent before it be too late; <HI>Let the Rod and Reproof teach thee Wisdom.</HI> Nor were they at any Loss what to do in this Case, well knowing what the Lord had said to them by the same Prophet, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ch. 18.7, 8.</NOTE> from which we shall see the Truth before us further confirmed, <HI>At what Instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to destroy it, If that Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil, I thought to do unto them.</HI></P>
<P>BUT so much for the third Observation.</P>
<P>I pass to the <HI>fourth</HI> and <HI>last,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="003015_0019_0FEF9F8262E13300"/>
<HI>OBSERV. IV.</HI> THAT if after all, we go on incorrigibly in our evil Ways, we may be as∣sured GOD has determin'd to pour out His Indignation upon us, even all His fierce Anger, and even to devour the Earth with the Fire of His Jealousy.</P>
<P>NOTHING can more provoke the holy and righteous GOD to do so, than incorrigible∣ness under His Judgments. And therefore the holy Prophet says concerning such, Jer. 5.3. <HI>O Lord, thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved, thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive Correction, they have made their Faces harder than a Rock, they have refused to return,</HI> and then it follows, <HI>He hath poured upon them the Fury of His Anger</HI> &amp;c. If inflicted, or threatned, Calamities don't attain the End for which they are sent, viz. to hum∣ble, reform, and do us good, if we will not be reclaim'd, but go on impenitently still, we may fear, that, that will be quickly the Lord's Determination concerning us, Ezek. 24.13. <HI>Because I have purged thee,</HI> i. e. used Means for thy Reformation, and thou wast not reformed, <HI>Thou shalt not be purged from thy Filthiness any more, till I have caused my Fury to rest upon thee.</HI> So GOD told <HI>Moses,</HI> Deut. 31.16, 17. That if they <HI>brake His Covenant, His Anger should be kindled against them, and He would forsake and hide his Face from them, and they should be devoured, and many Evils and Troubles befall them, so that they should say, Are not all
<PB N="26" REF="003015_0020_0FEF9F8409256288"/>these Evils come upon us, because of our evil Do∣ings?</HI> So <HI>Joshua</HI> said, <HI>Chap.</HI> 24.20. <HI>If ye for∣sake the Lord, then He will do you hurt and consume you, after that He hath done you good.</HI> GOD has been very terrible in the Execution of such Threatnings upon His covenant People. We read in the 78th <HI>Psalm,</HI> how <HI>they were a rebellious and stubborn Generation, that kept not the Covenant of GOD, and refused to walk in His Law,</HI> and notwithstanding all His marvel∣lous Appearances for them, yet <HI>sinned more a∣gainst Him, by provoking the most High in the Wilderness: Yea, they spake against GOD, there∣fore the Lord heard this, and was wroth, so a Fire was kindled against Jacob, and Anger al∣so came up against Israel: The Wrath of GOD came upon them, and slew them, He cast upon them the Fierceness of His Anger, Wrath and Indig∣nation, He made a Way to His Anger, He spa∣red not their Soul from Death, but gave their Life over to the Pestilence, and smote all their First-born;</HI> — But yet, we read again, that <HI>they tempted and provoked the most high GOD, and kept not His Testimonies, but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their Fathers, they were turned aside like a deceitful Bow, they provoked Him to Anger, and moved Him to Jealousie, when GOD heard this, He was wroth, and great∣ly abhorred Israel; so that He forsook their Ta∣bernacle, deliver'd their Strength into Captivity, and their Glory into the Enemies Hand, He gave His People over also to the Sword, and was wroth with His Inheritance, the Fire consumed them</HI> &amp;c.</P>

THEY are exhibited as a most terrible Ex∣ample to deter us from perfisting in a Course of Impenitence and Disobedience: Hence the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> says, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. 7.12, 13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>Go ye now to my Place which was in Shiloh, and see what I did to it, for the Wickedness of my People Israel; And now because ye have done all these Works, saith the Lord, and I spake unto you, rising up early, and speaking, but ye heard not, therefore I will cast you out of my Sight, and my Fury shall burn, and shall not be quenched, saith the Lord, ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you.</HI> I might multiply many such awful Threatnings of Wrath against an incorrigible People, for our Warning, and so for the Proof of the awful Observation, I am upon; I will mention one more, that in Jer. 44.10, 11. <HI>They are not humbled even unto this Day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law, nor in my Sta∣tutes that I set before you, and your Fathers, therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Behold I will set my Face against you for Evil.</HI> What terrible Displeasure does this Threatning carry in it, nothing short of this, that His <HI>Jealousie</HI> will burn against such a People, and He that made them will have no Mercy on them, that He will laugh at their Calamities, and mock when their Fear comes; that He will not only reject their Prayers, but answer them by ter∣rible Things in Righteousness, until He has <HI>consumed them utterly, so that there shall be no
<PB N="28" REF="003015_0021_0FEF9F85A9C1FCB8"/>Remnant, nor escaping.</HI> Thus has the <HI>Observa∣tion</HI> before us been confirmed from many dreadful Instances of the Wrath of GOD, pour'd out upon an impenitent and disobedi∣ent People, in the many <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Countries,</HI> that have been said waste and desolate for their Sins: How was <HI>Babylon</HI> the great de∣stroy'd, as GOD overthrew <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Go∣morrah, Jerusalem</HI> also, and the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> their Land made an utter Desolation! And this has been the dreadful Fate of many <HI>Churches</HI> that were once beautiful &amp; flourishing in the <HI>Christian World;</HI> What evident clear Convictions do such Examples give us of the Truth of this <HI>Observation?</HI> So that we may certainly look for such Desolation and Ruin, if we are alike Guilty before the Lord: And therefore such Judgments upon others are recorded for our <HI>Learning,</HI> and <HI>Admonition upon whom the Ends of the World are come.</HI> <Q><HI>Sodom</HI>'s Ashes, <HI>Shi∣loh</HI>'s Fire, <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s Desolation are Uses of Instruction and Warning to all the Inhabi∣tants of the Earth: They fell by their In∣iquity, and such as tread in their wicked Steps, may expect to fall by the like Judg∣ments; for GOD is uniform, and of a piece with Himself in his judicial. Proccedings: 'Tis a Rule of Justice, <HI>ut parium Par sit Ra∣tio;</HI> that the equally Guilty should be pu∣nish'd alike. Luke 13.3. <HI>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI></Q></P>

I might have mention'd several good Rea∣sons, why the Lord should come to such a Determination concerning an impenitent and disobedient People, I might shew, how the <HI>Honour</HI> of His own <HI>Narie</HI> calls for it, and how much His Glory is concerned in it, they Glory of His <HI>Holiness,</HI> and of His <HI>Faithfulness, Wis∣dom</HI> and other Attributes, and particularly, How the Honour of His <HI>Justice</HI> calls for such a <HI>Determination:</HI> For GOD will be weary of <HI>repenting,</HI> and be oblig'd to say concerning us, as of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> of old, <HI>For who shall have pi∣ty upon thee, O Jerusalem, or, who shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thee, Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward, therefore will I stretch out my Hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</HI> When GOD has waited a long Time, and been visiting with lighter and lesser Judgments, and then brought great∣er, if we will not be reformed by these Things, His Anger may well burn against us, and His Fury be poured out like Fire, to consume us. We are indeed ripe for Ruin, <HI>For shall not the Lord visit for such Things, and His Soul be a∣venged on such a Nation as this?</HI> But I pro∣ceed to some brief Application of what we have heard.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. THE first Use might be by Way of <HI>Examination, to put us upon a solemn Trial of our selves, Whether we are not chargeable with
<PB N="30" REF="003015_0022_0FEF9F8C27E31710"/>what the Prophet Zephaniah here charges upon Jerusalem?</HI> Have we not been disobedient to the Voice of GOD, in all those Ways, wherein we have heard, He has been calling aloud upon us? Oh that <HI>Conscience</HI> would do it's Office, that Deputy of GOD in thy Breast, and charge home the Guilt lying on thee for thy past Disobedience to the <HI>Voice of GOD</HI> from one time to another: Let that <HI>Preacher</HI> follow thee Home, and make <HI>Application,</HI> of what has been said, and see that thou rever∣ence the Dictates of thy enlightned and a∣wakned Conscience, as ever you hope or desire to have Peace of Conscience <HI>now,</HI> in <HI>Death,</HI> or at the <HI>Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>USE II. <HI>A Second Use might be by Way of Reproof, to the impenitent and disobedient, who have hitherto refus'd to fear GOD and re∣ceive Instruction.</HI> GOD has said concerning you, <HI>Surely they will now fear me, and receive Instruction.</HI> But you are yet Strangers to a holy Fear of Him, and you are going on in your Ways of Disobedience and Rebellion still; you are not humbled and reformed to this Day: The Voice of GOD to such, is that in Jer. 5.21, 22. <HI>Hear this now, O foolish People, and without Understanding, which have Eyes and see not, which have Ears and hear not: Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: Will ye not tremble at my Presence?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003015_0022_0FEF9F8C27E31710"/>
USE III. <HI>LET our past Stupidity and Diso∣bedience, to the Voice of GOD, be this Day, bewailed with Bitterness of Heart.</HI> We have hereby frustrated GOD's just Expectations from us, and have laid our selves open to His fiery Rebukes, even to have <HI>our Dwel∣lings cut off,</HI> and we destroyed with them.</P>
<P>USE IV. <HI>WE hence see how much it is our Interest to hear and fear, and receive Instruction.</HI> We may then be assured of the divine Care and Protection still, that GOD will then re∣member Mercy in the midst of Judgment, and the Fruit thereof shall be to take away Sin, to purify and refine us: He will not <HI>cut us off, with our Dwellings,</HI> however otherwise, He may punish us.</P>
<P>USE V. <HI>HENCE we learn, what we are to look for, if we do persist in our Impenitence and Disobedience, under the threatning Tokens of the divine Anger.</HI> We read, Amos 3.8. <HI>The Lord hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</HI> If we will not hear what He speaks, we may without pretending to much of a prophetic Spirit, foretell, what will be the awful Issue of such Disobedience: The 29th <HI>Chap.</HI> of <HI>Proverbs and</HI> 1. <HI>Verse,</HI> as well as my <HI>Text</HI> tells us what it will be.</P>
<P>It will be very awful indeed if after the Respit we have had, we should any of us <HI>harden our Hearts, and hearken not!</HI> We may
<PB N="32" REF="003015_0023_0FEF9F8A6390F330"/>well tremble to think of its being so with respect to too many in <HI>this Place,</HI> and throughout the <HI>Land:</HI> We have awful Instances of such in <HI>Scripture,</HI> I will only mention that in the 8th <HI>Chap.</HI> of <HI>Exodus.</HI> GOD brought a dreadful Judgment upon the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Pharaob</HI>'s Heart was to moved at it, he seem'd to be un∣der such good Impressions, that he called for <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and said, <HI>Intreat the Lord, that He may remove this Judgment.</HI> He seem'd earnestly desirous for that Time, that GOD would stay His Hand, and not destroy them immediately, and then he made Promises and Resolutions what he would do, if GOD would hear and answer, What now was the Issue? <HI>GOD was intreated for them, and did according to the Word of Moses.</HI> But in the next verse, we read, <HI>Treat when Pharaah saw that there was Respit, he harden'd his Heart, and hearken'd not unto them.</HI></P>
<P>THE Lord grant, <HI>this Word</HI> may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fulfiled with Respect to any in <HI>this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> or in <HI>this Land.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>USE VI. <HI>LET us all do our utmost, that the Lord may not proceed to such a Determination concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as this in my Text.</HI> Let us a∣gain hear it, and surely you will not hear it without <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>trembling.</HI><Q>Therefore wait ye upon me saith the Lord, until the Day
<PB N="33" REF="003015_0023_0FEF9F8A6390F330"/>that I rise up, for my Determination is to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce Anger, for all the Barth shall be devoured with the Fire of my Jealousie.</Q> Who knows but that the Great GOD may have come to this <HI>Determination</HI> already, <Q>That He will quickly come to take Venge∣ance on His Adversaries, that the Day we read of in the first Chapter of <HI>Nahum</HI>'s Prophesy, may be hastning greatly, when when the Mountains shall quake at Him, and the Earth be burnt at His Presence, yea the World, and all that dwell therein, when with an overrunning Flood, He will make an utter End of the Place, and Dark∣ness shall pursue His Enemies. What do we imagine against the Lord? He will make an utter End, Affliction shall not rise up a second Time; for while they be folden together as Thorns, and while they are drunken as Drunkards, they shall be de∣voured as Stubble fully dry.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT Hearts are ours, if they are not mov'd within us, when we read such terrible Denunciations of Wrath against the Enemies of GOD? They are harder surely than the very Rocks, that are thrown down by Him, if they don't tremble at His Presence, <HI>For who can abide the fierceness of His Anger, when His Fury is poured out like Fire?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="003015_0024_0FEF961644DAC088"/>
OH let us then in this Day of <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> repair to the Lord as a <HI>strong Hold,</HI> if we would have <HI>Rest in the Day of Trouble.</HI></P>
<P>LET us in our several Places and Stations, do what we possibly can to prevent the Lord's proceeding to such a <HI>Determination</HI> concern∣ing <HI>this People.</HI> The Lord seems as though He were loth to give us up, and make an ut∣ter End of us, as yet; and therefore He has been only shaking His Rod over us, and giv∣ing us and Alarm, an Warning of what we may expect, if we will not hear, and re∣turn unto Him.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Greatness</HI> of GOD don't awe and terrify us, yet shall not the <HI>sparing Mercy</HI> of GOD melt us! That though He threatned us with a sudden Destruction, He spared us from going down quick into the Pit, and has given us the space of <HI>now</HI> more than <HI>three Months,</HI> to repent in! This our <HI>Honourable Rulers,</HI> who not long since, call'd us together, made a particular mention of, to the Glory of the infinite <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD, towards a sinful unreformed People; And shall we not by all be led to Repentance? Shall Multitudes in this Land, (or any in this Place) continue still going on in Ways of <HI>Profaness,</HI> of <HI>Pride,</HI> and <HI>Sensuality,</HI> and other heinous GOD-provoking Evils, which have brought the surprizing amazing EARTHQUAKE upon us? Shall we keep one Day of solemn
<PB N="35" REF="003015_0024_0FEF961644DAC088"/><HI>Humiliation, Fasting, and Prayer</HI> after another, and the same heinous Iniquities prevail and abound, still? Shall there be no more of a <HI>general Repentance and Reformation</HI> of these Evils? If we should remain thus unreform∣ed still, I dread to think how <HI>those Days,</HI> will be Days of <HI>Provocation</HI> to GOD, and make Him very speedily come into this awful <HI>De∣termination</HI> concerning us: Nothing can provoke Him to do it more.</P>
<P>BUT GOD forbid, He should ever declare thus concerning us; if we would prevent it, let each one, lay his Hand on his Mouth, and his Mouth in the Dust, each one smiting on his own Breast, and crying, <HI>GOD be merci∣ful to me a Sinner:</HI> Let us set our selves to seek the Lord, before the <HI>Decree bring forth,</HI> before the <HI>fierce Anger of the Lord come upon us;</HI> nothing but a sincere <HI>Repentance,</HI> and tho∣rough <HI>Reformation</HI> will stay GOD's Hand: And Oh if there were such an Heart in this People, <HI>to fear GOD, and receive Instruction,</HI> it should yet be well with us; GOD would return in Mercy, and would yet spare us, and our Children, and <HI>our Dwellings,</HI> and not <HI>devour the Earth with the Curse:</HI> And so this <HI>ter∣rifying Dispensation</HI> would be the most useful one of our whole Lives; we shall have Reason to bless GOD for it all our Days.</P>
<P>WE have been (as we were directed, by those who <HI>feared, and proclaimed the late Fast</HI>)
<PB N="36" REF="003015_0025_0FEF9F91AF4F38A8"/>crying to GOD, that it may be a happy Means of the saving Conversion of many to GOD, and that in Order hereunto, the <Q>A∣wakning Impressions that have been made on the Minds of many in this Land, may be follow'd with the gracious Influences of His Spirit.</Q> We herein see the <HI>pious</HI> and earnest Sollicitude of our <HI>Rulers,</HI> for our <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> yea, for our <HI>saving Conversion,</HI> be∣cause they are afraid of further and more terrible Dispensations of divine Anger, and shall not we be concerned herefor, our selves? I trust through Grace, a considerable Num∣ber are, <HI>Our Hearts Desire and Prayer is, that All may.</HI> And, blessed be GOD, there are such Numbers made to hear and obey His Voice in other Places: we hope there shall be yet greater Numbers made to do so. And if the Labours of His Servants may at all con∣tribute to it; let the free and sovereign Grace of GOD have the Praise of it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it shall be, Let us still wait on GOD, with whom is the residue of the Spirit, for more plentiful outpourings of it, upon us, and ours, and <HI>all Flesh</HI> in the midst of us, For this, let us continue <HI>lifting up our Hearts with our Eyes and Hands unto GOD in the Heavens,</HI> with a believing Expectation, and encourag∣ing Hope, that GOD has Mercy in Store for us, and will yet <HI>think upon us, that we perish.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="003015_0025_0FEF9F91AF4F38A8"/>
REMARKABLE is the Example of <HI>Nineveh</HI> for our Encouragement, who were threatned with a speedy and utter Ruin and Desolation, <Q><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jonah Chap. 3d. from the 5th Verse.</NOTE> They believed GOD, and proclaimed a Fast, and put on Sackcloth from the great∣est of them, even to the least of them; The King arose from his Throne, and laid his Robe from him, and cover'd him with Sackcloth, and sat in Ashes, and caused it to be proclaim'd and published through <HI>Nineveh;</HI> and exhorted them to cry migh∣tily to GOD, and to turn every one from his evil Way; Who can tell (says he) if GOD will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we perish not. And GOD was intreated for them, as we see in the next Verse; And GOD saw their Works that they turned from their evil Way, and GOD repented of the Evil, that He had said He would do unto them, and He did it not.</Q></P>
<P>WOULD we have the Lord to stay His Hand, and not cut us off, with our Dwellings? Let us this Day, hear and <HI>obey His Voice,</HI> and now <HI>draw near to Him.</HI></P>
<P>BY the astonishing Dispensation of the EARTHQUAKE, may we not hear the Great GOD calling on us, as in Isai. 26.20, 21. <HI>Come, my People, enter thou into thy Chambers,
<PB N="38" REF="003015_0026_0FEF9F9410D4DA68"/>and shut thy Doors about thee: hide thy self as it were for a little Moment, until the Indignati∣on he overpast. For behold the Lord cometh out of his Place to punish the Inhabitants of the Earth for their Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>IF we should call off Fear, and restrain Prayer before GOD, and persist in our Dis∣obedience to His Voice, we shall be in great∣er Danger than ever of His dreadful Judg∣ments, and of EARTHQUAKES in a particular Manner; and if the Lord should <HI>arise and shake terribly the Earth again,</HI> you would then it may be, many of you, <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>tremble</HI> more: But Oh can nothing but EARTHQUAKES make you fear and tremble, can no other Dispensations of GOD bring you to your Knees, humble you to the Dust, and make you cry and plead for Mercy? If they may do so, it will be well for you, that <HI>Fearfulness</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> should again come upon you, and your <HI>Bones,</HI> as well as your <HI>Houses</HI> shake: You read how the <HI>Jaylour</HI> sprang in trembling and crying out, <HI>Sirs, What must I do to be saved?</HI> And that Day, <HI>Salvation came to him, and his House, he and all his were strait-way baptized</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts 16.29, 30, 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>On when shall we see you <HI>trembling</HI> and <HI>astonished,</HI> and making the same Inquiry?</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="003015_0026_0FEF9F9410D4DA68"/>
IF you were <HI>prick'd to the Heart,</HI> you would be <HI>going and weeping, and seeking the Lord your GOD;</HI> you would pray more, more humbly, earnestly, and importunately, as well as more frequently for your <HI>Conversion;</HI> and that you might be prepared for all the great Events of Providence, and even for the <HI>com∣ing of the Day of GOD.</HI> Yea, you would not let the Lord go until He look down from Heaven with an Eye of Pity on you. You will be never easier than when in your <HI>Cham∣bers,</HI> seeking for the Mercy of GOD to your selves, and yours; especially when you can solace your own Souls with any comfortable Grounds of Hope GOD has <HI>heard your Pray∣ers, and will not turn away His Mercy from you.</HI> And how can you live with any Com∣fort, if you have no Hope of this?</P>
<P>OH that Men would seek the Lord, while He may be found, and call upon Him while He is near, and give Glory to GOD before their Feet stumble upon the dark Mountains, when all Intreaties for Mercy will be too late!</P>
<P>IT may be fear'd, that desolating Judg∣ments are hastning upon us, that the <HI>Inhabi∣tants</HI> of the Land, are ripe for them, and it may be, for a destroying EARTHQUAKE that shall lay some Parts of it waste and desolare. And shall not this awful Consideration excite and move us to cry for Mercy? GOD shakes
<PB N="40" REF="003015_0027_0FEF9F96F28AB498"/>His Rod over us, to bring us to do so, and from His sparing Mercy to <HI>this Hour,</HI> we may be assur'd, This is the Language of His Heart concerning us <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hosea II. S, 9.</NOTE> <HI>How shall I give thee up, E∣phraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? and set thee as Zebeim? Mine Heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together, I will not exe∣cute the Fierceness of mine Anger, I will not re∣turn to destroy you.</HI> But verily, if we will not <HI>obey His Voice,</HI> He will <HI>return</HI> in Anger, and more terrible EARTHQUAKES than those of the <HI>last Week</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jan 28 and Tuesday following.</NOTE> may be look'd for still.</P>
<P>In looks, at present, as if the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD had not been enough hearkned to, that the Great GOD should so continue <HI>roaring</HI> from the <HI>deep Places of the Earth.</HI> He seems to be conning nearer to us; and if we shall now be visited as our <HI>Neighbours</HI> in the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts of the <HI>Province</HI> have been, the Lord grant, the like Impressions may be made on our Minds, that have on such Numbers there.</P>
<P>IT may be, we shall go on, many of us, in our Disobedience to the Voice of GOD, and <HI>Conscience,</HI> till we feel more terrible <HI>Convul∣sons</HI> of the Earth under us; and we shall e∣ven <HI>then,</HI> if we don't hear also, the <HI>still small Voice</HI> of His Word and Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="003015_0027_0FEF9F96F28AB498"/>
METHINKS, I now find my self brought by <HI>the Hand of the Lord, into the midst of the Val∣ley, which is full of Bones</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To allude to Ezek. 37, 1, —12.</NOTE> where there are <HI>many very dry,</HI> and hear the Lord saying, <HI>Can these Bones live?</HI> To which I make the Answer prepar'd for me, <HI>O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</HI></P>
<P>WE have prophesy'd upon these <HI>Bones,</HI> and said unto them, <HI>O ye dry Bones, hear the Word of the Lord,</HI> and may the Lord GOD now say, unto <HI>these Bones, Behold I will cause Breath to enter into you, and ye shall live, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we prophesy as we are commanded, May there be <HI>a Noise and a Shaking,</HI> and then the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD which is the Wind that bloweth where it listeth, come and <HI>breathe upon these Slain, that they may live, and stand up upon their Feet an exceeding great Army.</HI> We have reason to pray, and hope for it.</P>
<P>LET none then, now say, especially such as are under Convictions, <HI>Our Bones are dried, and our Hope is lost, we are cut off, for our Parts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TO conclude,</HI> LET us now hear the Word of the Lord, unto us, in Jer. 13.15, 16. <HI>Hear ye and give ear, Be not proud: for the Lord hath spoken, Give Glory to the Lord your GOD,
<PB N="42" REF="003015_0028_0FEF9F99E320E798"/>before be cause Darkness, and before your Feet stumble upon the dark Mountains, and while ye look for Light, He turn it into the Shadow of Death, and make it gross Darkness.</HI> And that Word also, in Mal. 2.2. <HI>If ye will not bear, and will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory unto any Name, saith the Lord of Hosts, I will even send a Curse upon you, and I will curse your Blessings:</HI> We trust GOD has not yet said, and Oh that He never may, as in the remain∣der of the <HI>Verse, Yea, I have cursed them alrea∣dy, because ye do not lay it to Heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shut up all</HI> with that <HI>Exhortation,</HI> in Heb. 12. from the 25th Verse to the End. <HI>See that ye rofuse not Him that speaketh; for if they es∣caped not who refused him that spake on Earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaketh from Heaven: Whose Voice then shook the Earth, but now He hath promised, saying, yet once more, I shake not the Earth only, but also Heaven. And this Word yet once more, signifieth the removing of those Things that are shaken, as of Things that are made, that those Things which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore, we receiving a King∣dom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may serve GOD acceptably, with Reverence, and GODLY FEAR. FOR OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE.</HI></P>
