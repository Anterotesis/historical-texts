<HEAD>FREE-GRACE at Work For them that are <HI>Chosen</HI> to GLORY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Joh VI. 37.</HI></BIBL>
<P>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE ESSAY which I am going upon, is, To Rescue some Glorious <HI>Truths</HI> of GOD and of GRACE, from the <HI>Abuse,</HI> which I See they commonly meet withal. <HI>Truths,</HI> I am sure, they are, which the Service of our Holy Religion mightily requires us to Explain and Propound in such a manner, as that <HI>they</HI> may be Serviceable. <HI>O Eternal Spirit of Truth, Who Leadest thy Servants into all Truth, Assist and Prosper my Undertaking▪</HI></P>
<P>The Illustrious Doctrine of <HI>Predestination,</HI> Some that Profess the Belief of it, very Sinfully <HI>Pervert</HI> it, as if it were a Doctrine Calculated either for the <HI>Security,</HI> or the <HI>Discouragement,</HI> of them who should be brought unto <HI>Repentance;</HI> to make Sinful Men, either <HI>Presumptuous</HI> or <HI>Desperate,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001256_0003_0FB18A3C357A1BF8"/>
Whereupon the Doctrine is decried by the Sons of Pride and Profaneness, as if it were an <HI>Useless,</HI> yea, and an <HI>Hurtful</HI> Doctrine, and as if it were best of all never at all to meddle with it.</P>
<P>A Glorious Doctrine of Christianity, has been <HI>Crucifyed</HI> between <HI>Two Thieves:</HI> It must be <HI>Deliver∣ed from the Sword;</HI> the <HI>dear</HI> Truth must be <HI>Deli∣vered from the Power of the Dog:</HI> A <HI>Crown of Glory</HI> must be set upon the Head thereof.</P>
<P>Indeed the Doctrine of <HI>Predestination</HI> hath its Mysteries, its Abstruse Difficulties, and Soaring Sublimities. But, for men to pretend therefore, that it should be Silenced and Smothered &amp; Shut out of Sermons, is for them to be, as the Profes∣sors of <HI>Leyden</HI> justly Expressed it, <HI>Praepostere Cauti,</HI> more <HI>Nice</HI> than <HI>Wise,</HI> more Cautious than they need to be; and there is usually, <HI>A Snake in the Grass,</HI> when such a <HI>Doctrine of Godliness</HI> is much <HI>hissed</HI> at. We find, the Doctrine of <HI>Predesti∣nation</HI> Proposed by our LORD, and His A∣postles, with a very frequent Inculcation; We find, that it hath a wondrous Tendency to the <HI>Edification</HI> of the Faithful in their <HI>most Holy Faith,</HI> and the Ignorance of it mutilates the <HI>Praise</HI> of God, and cherishes the <HI>Vice</HI> of man, in very con∣siderable Instances. Briefly, Tis no little part of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> and we do not fully Preach the <HI>Gos∣pel, Declaring the whole Counsel of God,</HI> if there be nothing of <HI>this</HI> Declared.</P>
<P>This is a thing to be set before you, in the most advantageous Terms that I can meet with∣al.
<PB N="3" REF="001256_0004_0FB18A3D6713FF70"/>
And where can any be met withal compa∣rable to those in the <HI>Seventeenth</HI> among those Fa∣mous <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> which are Subscribed by all the Allowed Clergy of the Nation!</P>
<P>PREDESTINATION <HI>to Life, is the E∣verlasting Purpose of God, whereby before the Foundations of the World were laid, He hath constantly Decreed by His Counsel, secret to us, to deliver from Curse and Damnation, those whom He hath Chosen in Christ Iesus out of Mankind, and to bring them by Christ to Everlasting Salvation, as Vessels made to Honour.</HI></P>
<P>It Proceeds.</P>
<P><HI>As the Godly Confideration of</HI> PRE∣DESTINATION <HI>and our Election in Christ, is full of Sweet, Pleasant and Vnspeakable Comfort to Godly Per∣sons, and such as feel in themseves the workings of the Spirit of Christ, — as well because it doth Establish and Confirm their Faith of Eternal Sal∣vation, to be Enjoy'd thro' Christ, as because it doth frequently kindle their Love towards God; so for curious and carnal Persons lacking the Spi∣rit of Christ, to have continually before their Eyes, the Sentence of Gods Pre∣destination, is a most dangerous Down fall.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001256_0005_0FB18A3FF92F6780"/>The Doctrine so Plainly <HI>Asserted</HI> by the <HI>Church of England,</HI> is every Day so Unaccountably De∣cried, and Reproached, by many from whom One could not with any <HI>Reason</HI> have Expected it, many, who boast themselves <HI>the Sons of the Church;</HI> that it is high Time for us, to do what we may, to <HI>Magnify it and make it Honourable.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord-Redeemer is now Preaching of the Doctrine. He had a very sorrowful Sight before Him; the <HI>Unbelief,</HI> the General and the Horri∣ble Unbelief of the People to whom He had been Exhibited. That our Lord might Comfort Him∣self under the <HI>Unsuccessfulness</HI> of His Ministry, and that He might preserve others from the <HI>Tempta∣tion</HI> and <HI>Stumbling-block</HI> therein Laid before them, He Propounds, the <HI>Decree</HI> of God in His Eternal <HI>Predestination.</HI></P>
<P>What else can we have, in any measure to allay the Discomposure of our Minds, when we see the <HI>Gospel</HI> hitherto so little Crown'd with <HI>Success</HI> in the World! <HI>All that the Father gives to me,</HI> saith our Lord, <HI>shall come to me.</HI></P>
<P>Tis plainly Asserted, That <HI>every one, who is given</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ by God the Father, shall at one Time or other by Faith <HI>come unto Him.</HI> Tis plainly Asserted, That these Persons are <HI>given</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, before they do by Faith <HI>come unto Him.</HI> Hence it follows, That the <HI>giv∣ing</HI> of any to the Lord Jesus Christ by God the Father, is not His <HI>Bringing</HI> them to <HI>Believe</HI> on Him. If it be <HI>Before</HI> their Believing, we shall
<PB N="5" REF="001256_0006_0FB18A427110DA20"/>
soon find it to be, as other of the Divine Oracles have told us, <HI>From all Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>This then is the DOCTRINE to be insisted on.</P>
<P><HI>There are Some, whom God the Fa∣ther, has from all Eternity given unto our Lord-Redeemer, to be brought by Him unto Eternal Bles∣sedness; and all that are so Given unto our Lord, shall in Time come unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>Do not imagine, That I am going to Enter∣tain you with Unprofitable Speculations. No; Your Entertainment shall be a <HI>Great Mystery of Godliness;</HI> I shall use my best contrivance, that every Stroke of it may be most sensibly Sub∣servient unto the Designs of <HI>Godliness.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Shall we prove, <HI>That there are Some, whom God has from all Eternity Chosen, to be brought unto Eternal Blessedness?</HI> They who Dispute this, <HI>do Err, not knowing the Scripture, nor the Nature of God.</HI> Indeed, the <HI>Christian Fathers</HI> did not so often and so clearly Express themselves about our <HI>Eternal Election,</HI> before the <HI>Pelagian Heresy</HI> made much Disturbance, as <HI>Austin</HI> and Others did afterwards. But the Word of God is very Positive; [Rom. 8.29.] That there are Some, <HI>Whom God did Fore-know, and whom He did Fore-know, He also did Pre∣destinate,
<PB N="6" REF="001256_0007_0FB18A43E43341F8"/>
to be conformed unto the Image of His Son.</HI> And, [2 Thess. 2.13.] That there are Some, <HI>Whom God has from the Beginning Chosen to Salvation.</HI> And, [1 Pet. 1.2.] That there are Some, <HI>Elect according to the Fore knowledge of God the Father.</HI> Do we not read, [Rev. 13.8.] Of, <HI>Names Written in the Book of Life of the Slain Lamb, from the Foun∣dation of the World?</HI> In the Word of God, we find a Remarkable Distinction, [1 Thess. 5.9.] Between Some <HI>Appointed unto Wrath,</HI> and Others <HI>Appointed to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> The Import of these passages, will soon be per∣ceived, if you will but lay together a few Incon∣testable Conclusions.</P>
<P>There is an <HI>Eternal Blessedness;</HI> or, a <HI>Rest which remains for the People of God,</HI> yea, a State wherein God shall become <HI>All in All</HI> unto His People. No body doubts of this.</P>
<P>There are Some who do arrive to <HI>Eternal Bles∣sedness;</HI> And they are but <HI>Some; Some</HI> there are who <HI>fall short of Entering into Rest.</HI> No body doubts of this.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eternal Blessedness</HI> is the gift of <HI>God;</HI> None ever come to <HI>Eternal Blessedness,</HI> but such as are by the Blessed GOD Himself brought unto it. No body doubts of this.</P>
<P>God from all Eternity does infallibly <HI>Fore know</HI> whom He will bring unto <HI>Eternal Blessedness.</HI> It can't be said of any Person in the <HI>Eternal Blessed∣ness,</HI> That God once did not infallibly <HI>Fore know</HI> whether this Person should ever come unto it.
<PB N="7" REF="001256_0008_0FB18A4569ECECE8"/>
Can any body doubt of this?</P>
<P>Once more; The <HI>Eternal Certainty</HI> of the <HI>E∣ternal Blessedness</HI> to be granted unto these and those Persons, cannot arise from the Persons themselves, who are not yet in Being; It can arise from nothing but <HI>God</HI> Himself Determining of it; from nothing but the <HI>Determination</HI> of God.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Argument is this.</P>
<P>If it be Certainly and Exactly <HI>Fore known</HI> by God from all Eternity, Who shall be brought by Him to <HI>Eternal Blessedness,</HI> then it is <HI>Decreed</HI> by God; there is in the <HI>Will</HI> of God a <HI>Determination</HI> of it. But there is a most <HI>Certain Fore knowledge</HI> of God, <HI>(unto whom all His Works are known from the Beginning,)</HI> even from all Eternity, Assuring Him, who shall be brought by Him to Eternal Blessedness. God forbid, We should so derogate from His Infinite Majesty, as if He did not from all <HI>Eternity</HI> most certainly <HI>Know</HI> what shall come to pass in <HI>Time: Lord, Thy Understanding is Infinite!</HI> Therefore, it remains, That there are Some Cho∣sen by a <HI>Decree</HI> of God, from all Eternity, to E∣ternal Blessedness.</P>
<P>Upon this Argument, our <HI>Twiss</HI> openly chal∣lenged the whole Nation of <HI>Jesuites</HI> and <HI>Armini∣ans;</HI> he truly sayes of it, It is, <HI>Nullo humano acu∣mine Solubile;</HI> It is unanswerable.</P>
<P>But now, My Hearers, Let us make a Pause. This admirable Truth shall not go out of our Hands, until we feel it make a most Heart-melting Impression on our Hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001256_0009_0FB18A46E1FB95C0"/>§. We will Enquire, first; <HI>Whether they whom God has from all Eternity Chosen to Eternal Blessed∣ness, may come to Know that they are so Chosen to it, while they are yet but in the way loading to it?</HI></P>
<P>Yes; They may. They may <HI>Know</HI> it, by their being <HI>in the way leading to it;</HI> For it is, <HI>The Way Everlasting.</HI> There are some, whose Priviledge is that, 1 Thess. 1.4. <HI>Knowing your Election of God.</HI></P>
<P>But how shall we attain to this Priviledge?</P>
<P>O Child of God; <HI>Say not in thy Heart,</HI> who shall ascend into Heaven, to see whether I have my <HI>Name Written in Heaven?</HI> Who shall bring down to me the <HI>Book of Life,</HI> to see whe∣ther I am Enroll'd in that Book or no? The Proof of all this matter is <HI>Nigh</HI> unto thee; Tis in thy own Heart, in thy own Life; There it may be met withal. Oh! Give a Great Atten∣tion!</P>
<P>You have <HI>not forgotten the Exhortation, that so speaks unto you;</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give Diligence to make your Calling and Election Sure.</HI> If you are <HI>Sure,</HI> That you are <HI>Effectually Called,</HI> you may be <HI>Sure,</HI> That you are <HI>Eternally Chosen</HI> of God. The matter may <HI>at this Moment</HI> be brought unto a wondrous Issue. The <HI>Call</HI> of our Great Saviour is at this Moment made from Heaven unto every one of us; <HI>Look unto me, and be Saved; come unto me, that I may make you Wise, and Righteous and Holy and Happy.</HI> May the Spirit of Grace now fall upon us; may our Conquered Souls comply with the Call, and Reply to it; <HI>Lord, I Look!
<PB N="9" REF="001256_0010_0FB18A48AF80F320"/>
Lord, I come! Lord; Thou hast made me willing to take thee for my Saviour, my Leader, my Ruler for ever more!</HI> From this Moment, O Regenerated Souls, you may take for granted your <HI>Election</HI> of God; you may take it for granted; <HI>My God will now give me to see the Good of His Chosen, and rejoyce with the gladness of His Nation, and Glory with His Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>We read, Act. 13.48. <HI>As many as were ordained unto Eternal Life believed.</HI> Examine then; <Q>Do I <HI>Believe</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ? Is my whole <HI>Reliance</HI> upon Him, as my <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and my <HI>Ad∣vocate,</HI> for my Peace with God? Am I heartily Resign'd unto Him, for Him to <HI>Guide me by Counsil, and bring me to Glory?</HI></Q> If it be so, then be of Good Comfort; Thou art most certainly <HI>Ordained unto Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>We read, Eph. 1.4. <HI>He has Chosen us, that we should be Holy.</HI> Examine then; <Q>Am I <HI>Holy?</HI> Do I follow nothing so much as <HI>Holiness?</HI> Do I La∣ment nothing so much as my want of <HI>Holiness?</HI> Do I Sincerely <HI>Dedicate</HI> my self unto God? Would I fain be entirely Possessed by <HI>God,</HI> and have my All employ'd in Serving of Him?</Q> If it be so, then be of Good Comfort; God who <HI>knows who are His,</HI> has <HI>Chosen</HI> thee for one of His.</P>
<P>Go on, and bring the Matter to this <HI>Touch∣stone.</HI> We read; 1 Joh. 4.19. <HI>We Love Him, be∣cause He first Loved us.</HI> Even so; <HI>We chuse God, because He first chose us.</HI> Bring it under an impar∣tial Examination. Do you make <HI>Choice</HI> of GOD?
<PB N="10" REF="001256_0011_0FB18A49DF1BBEC0"/>
There is a Twofold <HI>Satisfaction</HI> Profered unto you; A Satisfaction in <HI>Creatures,</HI> and, A Satis∣faction in <HI>God.</HI> You have once <HI>Chosen</HI> a Satisfacti∣on in <HI>Creatures.</HI> Do you Bewayl, Disclaim, Re∣voke that <HI>Choice?</HI> Do you now <HI>Chuse over again?</HI> Tis <HI>Religion,</HI> (Perhaps in the very <HI>Etymology</HI> of the Word) so to do. Is the Language of your Souls now that? Lam. 3.24. <HI>The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul; therefore I will hope in Him?</HI> And, Psal. 119.57. <HI>Thou art my Portion, O Lord; I have said, that I would keep thy Words.</HI> Do you <HI>Chuse</HI> rather to have the <HI>knowledge</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Image,</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Favour</HI> of GOD, than to have all the Good Things of a Flatter∣ing <HI>World?</HI> Is this the <HI>Choice</HI> and the Voice of your Minds; <HI>Lord, There is nothing that I desire in comparison of thee!</HI> Then, Rejoyce, O <HI>Chosen</HI> Soul, <HI>Rejoyce with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory;</HI> God has <HI>Chosen</HI> thee to <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>§. We will, next, Enquire; <HI>With what Ac∣knowledgments ought they to Glorify God, who thus know themselves to be Chosen of Him?</HI></P>
<P>Truly, With Acknowledgments and Admira∣tions of <HI>Sovereign Grace;</HI> The <HI>Grace</HI> that shines forth in our <HI>Election</HI> with a most astonishing <HI>So∣vereignty!</HI> Here, Here, are <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> of the most <HI>Elevated Strain</HI> in Christianity. They are, <HI>Words to lift up the Horn!</HI> they <HI>Sound High</HI> in our Devotions. A Thankful Christian does Raise His <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> to the Rarest and Highest

Notes imaginable, when he comes hereabouts. Tis a <HI>Melody</HI> peculiarly acceptable to <HI>Heaven;</HI> Tis the very <HI>Beginning</HI> of <HI>Heaven!</HI></P>
<P>First. Will you not Admire, <HI>O Chosen of God,</HI> Admire the <HI>Absolute Sovereignty</HI> of God in His <HI>Chusing</HI> of you! Vast is the <HI>Difference</HI> which the <HI>Choice</HI> of God puts between One Man and Ano∣ther. But what is the <HI>cause</HI> of His putting such a <HI>Difference?</HI> Tis even so, <HI>Lord, Meerly because it pleases thee.</HI> Thus we are advised; Rom. 9.16, 18. <HI>It is not of him that Willeth, nor of him that Runneth, but of God that sheweth Mercy: He hath Mercy on whom He well.</HI> Why has our God <HI>Elected</HI> One, and <HI>Rejected</HI> Another? Tis that <HI>First Cause</HI> of all things, that is the <HI>Sole Cause</HI> of this; namely, The <HI>Will</HI> of the Glorious One. The <HI>Royal Pre∣rogative</HI> of God is wonderfully Exerted in this matter; and <HI>He will give none Account of the matter.</HI> Is the Fore-sight of our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> the <HI>Cause</HI> why God has <HI>Chosen</HI> us? Then say, We <HI>first</HI> choose God <HI>before</HI> He chooses us! Not at all. It was a Text often quoted by <HI>Austin,</HI> to confute this Fancy; Joh. 15.16. <HI>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.</HI> We are chosen TO <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience;</HI> not chosen FOR our Foreseen <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI> They are the <HI>Effects</HI> of our <HI>Election;</HI> they cannot be the <HI>Causes</HI> of it. Our Gods <HI>Fore∣sight</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> presupposes His purpose to bestow <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> upon us; For these are alwayes the <HI>Gifts of God.</HI> Now this very purpose is our <HI>Election</HI> it self; And hence,
<PB N="12" REF="001256_0013_0FB18A4FC2BB3030"/>
the <HI>Fore-sight</HI> of those <HI>Gifts</HI> cannot be the <HI>cause</HI> of our <HI>Election.</HI> What sayes our Apostle? Rom. 9.11. <HI>The Purpose of God, according to Election, tis not of Works.</HI> Our <HI>Election</HI> is indeed <HI>Absolute.</HI> No Decree of God is <HI>Conditional,</HI> tho God may decree a <HI>Condition.</HI> It were derogatory to the Perfection of God, for His <HI>Decree,</HI> to depend on any <HI>Conditi∣on;</HI> tho' the Things Decreed, may in the Execu∣tion thereof, do so. The Decree of <HI>Election</HI> is not, <HI>That if we will Believe we shall be Saved,</HI> but it is, <HI>That we shall be Saved, and that in order to it we shall believe.</HI> So <HI>Absolute</HI> our <HI>Election.</HI> And how <HI>Gratuitous!</HI> Altogether <HI>Free.</HI> The Great God is <HI>Blessed</HI> for ever in and of Himself. He has no <HI>Need</HI> of <HI>Us.</HI> He was under no <HI>Ne∣cessity</HI> to <HI>Chuse</HI> any of us unto Eternal Blessedness. If He would chuse <HI>any,</HI> He was under no <HI>Necessi∣ty</HI> to pitch upon <HI>Such</HI> or <HI>Such,</HI> Make thy Re∣flection, O <HI>Chosen Vessel.</HI> <Q>Oh! why am I a <HI>Chosen Vessel of Mercy,</HI> and not a <HI>Vessel of Wrath!</HI> Why would God set His Love upon <HI>me,</HI> rather than upon another! <HI>Lord, Thou Lovest, Because thou Lovest!</HI> Be Satisfied, O my Soul, Be Satis∣fied, in the uncontroleable, the unaccountable <HI>Will of God,</HI> as the only <HI>Cause</HI> of His <HI>Chusing</HI> me for His own.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly; Will you not Admire, <HI>O Chosen of God,</HI> Admire the <HI>Eternity</HI> from which He has <HI>Chosen</HI> you, the <HI>Eternity</HI> to which he has <HI>Chosen</HI> you.</P>
<P>Look <HI>Backwards.</HI> When was it that our God first made His <HI>Choice</HI> of us? We read, Eph. 1.4.
<PB N="13" REF="001256_0014_0FB18A50D4DC6C70"/>
<HI>He has chosen us before the Foundation of the World.</HI> Then, it was before the very First Dawn of <HI>Time;</HI> For, <HI>Time</HI> is but the <HI>Duration of the World.</HI> And thus, we are told, That God has a <HI>Gracious Purpose concerning us, before the World began.</HI> A Ridiculous Absurdity it is, to imagine, That a Man is not <HI>Elected,</HI> until God has waited all the Time of a Mans Life, to see whether he will <HI>Persevere</HI> in a Course of Well-doing, or no. Far from it! <HI>Before the Mountains were settled, while God had not yet made the Earth, nor the Highest part of the Dust of the World,</HI> Even then were we <HI>Chosen</HI> of God. How does the <HI>Anci∣ent of Dayes</HI> comfort us! Jer. 31.3. <HI>I have Loved thee with an Everlasting Love.</HI> Think, O most undeserving Object of <HI>Love:</HI> <Q>When did the Lord <HI>Begin</HI> to Think of bestowing His <HI>Love</HI> and His <HI>Life</HI> upon me! Truly, His Thoughts of <HI>Love</HI> to me never did <HI>Begin:</HI> but they have been <HI>from Everlasting;</HI> and <HI>Ever of Old;</HI> Tho' I am one of the <HI>poorest</HI> and <HI>vilest,</HI> and most Worthless Things in the World, yet my God has been <HI>Thinking upon me,</HI> and had His Kind purposes concerning me, infinitely before the Foundation of the World.</Q></P>
<P>Look <HI>Forwards.</HI> Will the Lord Repent of His <HI>Choice?</HI> Never; Never. 'Tis unaltarable. We read, 1 Sam. 15.29. <HI>He is not a man, that he should Repent.</HI> The <HI>Choice</HI> made of us, 'tis an Act of Him, whose Name is, <HI>I am that I am;</HI> and, <HI>The God who changes not.</HI> There is nothing wanting
<PB N="14" REF="001256_0015_0FB18A5222BCB340"/>
in His <HI>Wisdom,</HI> or His <HI>Power;</HI> What can there be to Dispose Him to a <HI>Change?</HI> He abides firm to His Intentions. <HI>The purpose of the Lord shall Stand,</HI> and, <HI>I will do all my pleasure, saith the Lord.</HI> We have such Tidings from Heaven to fortify us; Rom. 8.39. <HI>Nothing shall be able to Separate us from the Love of God.</HI> If <HI>Elected,</HI> then how <HI>Esta∣blished?</HI> The Earth may be Removed, Moun∣tains may be overturned, the Pillars of Heaven may tremble; but our Hope of Heaven is laid on a <HI>Foundation that cannot be Shaken!</HI> Think, O Son of well-founded <HI>Hope:</HI> <Q>The God who is Resolved, That He will surely do me Good, will never alter His Resolution. I am a poor, feeble, fickle creature; &amp; I should soon <HI>Cast off God,</HI> if I were left unto my self; But He has purposed that He will not <HI>Cast off me;</HI> and therefore He will not Leave me unto my self. I shall be <HI>kept by the mighty power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> We must proceed now to Observe; <HI>That there is an Eternal <HI>Covenant of Redempti∣on,</HI> wherein God the Father Gave His Chosen Peo∣ple, unto our Lord-Redeemer, for Him to bring us unto Eternal Blessedness.</HI> The <HI>Chosen</HI> of God, are such as the <HI>Father</HI> has <HI>Given</HI> unto our Lord Je∣sus Christ. We read, Eph. 1.4. <HI>He has Chosen us in Him.</HI> Our LORD Himself is the <HI>First Chosen,</HI> and the <HI>Head</HI> of all the <HI>Chosen;</HI> and all the <HI>Cho∣sen</HI> are committed into His Glorious <HI>Hands.</HI></P>

<P>First; In the Eternal <HI>Election</HI> of God, it is De∣creed, That Such and Such, <HI>[The Persons are De∣termined, and the Number of those Persons is with God!]</HI> They are to be <HI>Heirs of God,</HI> and <HI>Joint-Heirs</HI> with His <HI>Messiah,</HI> in the Eternal Blessedness. But the Decree also Permitted these Heirs of <HI>Life,</HI> to <HI>Fall</HI> into wretched circumstances, that should render it Necessary for the <HI>Messiah</HI> to take upon Him, the Character of a REDEEMER for them. Wherefore, in the Eternal <HI>Election</HI> of God, the <HI>Son</HI> of God was <HI>Ordained</HI> the <HI>Redeemer</HI> of His <HI>Chosen,</HI> and <HI>Appointed</HI> to do all that was to be done in the <HI>Redemption</HI> that must bring us, to the Eter∣nal Blessedness. But now, the Son of God, was wholly <HI>Free,</HI> about His own coming into the <HI>Decree</HI> of a <HI>Redeemer;</HI> He most <HI>Freely</HI> came into it; It was with his <HI>Free,</HI> and Fair and Full con∣sent; It was without any <HI>Compulsion</HI> that He un∣dertook the <HI>Redemption</HI> of Man. Hence it is, that the Transaction between God the Father, and out Lord-Redeemer, in the <HI>Decree</HI> for the <HI>Re∣demption</HI> of Man, is most fitly represented in the Form of a <HI>Covenant;</HI> which we call, <HI>The Co∣venant of Redemption.</HI> With an Eye to this wonderful Transaction, we find that passage in our <HI>Lively Oracles;</HI> Psal. 89.3. <HI>I have made a Covenant with my chosen, I have Sworn unto Da∣vid my Servant.</HI></P>
<P>It is very Surprising to find, in the Writings
<PB N="16" REF="001256_0017_0FB18A55AA1E97C0"/>
of the ancient <HI>Jews</HI> themselves, a confession of this <HI>Mystery.</HI> A Book of theirs, called <HI>Pesikta,</HI> recites this, as a <HI>Dialogue</HI> between the <HI>Almighty</HI> and the <HI>Messiah.</HI></P>
<Q><P>GOD, beginning to make a <HI>Covenant</HI> with the <HI>Messiah,</HI> Spake thus to Him.</P>
<P><Q>They whose Sins are unknown to thee, would impose a Yoke of Iron upon thee, by which they will make thee, like to a Young Heifer, almost Blind with Labour, and they will destroy thee; Because of their Iniquity, thy Tongue shall cleave unto the Roof of thy Mouth. Art thou willing to suffer all this?</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Messiah</HI> answered;</P>
<P><Q>It may be, these Pains and Afflictions, shall endure but for a Short time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>GOD.] I am Resolved, thou shalt Suffer it for a whole Week of Years; But if thou wilt not Consent unto it, I will not Impose these Sufferings upon thee.</Q></P>
<P><Q>MESSIAH.] I willingly Submit to it, on Condition that no Israelite Perish, but that they shall all be Saved; those that are born after my Time, and those that are already Dead, since Adam.</Q></P></Q>
<P>O ye Modern <HI>Jews,</HI> that cannot bear to hear of a <HI>Suffering Messiah,</HI> what can you say to this Quotation?</P>
<P>To go on; In this <HI>Covenant of Redemp∣tion,</HI> the Great GOD commits the care of His Chosen, unto the Charge of our Lord-Redeemer.
<PB N="17" REF="001256_0018_0FB18A57F98422E8"/>
Tis because of this <HI>Covenant,</HI> that our Lord could say; Joh. 17.2. <HI>Thou hast given Him Power over all Flesh, that He should give Eternal Life unto as many as thou hast given Him.</HI> God the <HI>Father</HI> then propounded unto the <HI>Son;</HI> <Q>There are such and such, whom I <HI>Chuse,</HI> to be brought unto a Glorious and Intimate <HI>Communion</HI> with thee, in thy <HI>Blessedness.</HI> I put these my <HI>Chosen</HI> into thy Hands, for thee to <HI>Redeem</HI> them out of all the Wretchedness, from whence they must be <HI>Raised,</HI> before they can come to that <HI>Blessedness.</HI> Do Thou, <HI>O Mine Elect, in whom my Soul de∣lights,</HI> Do Thou undertake the Work of a <HI>Re∣deemer,</HI> for these my <HI>Chosen;</HI> I will do all that belongs to Me, for thy <HI>Encouragement</HI> in this Excellent Undertaking.</Q> [See, Psal. 40.8. and, Isa. 42.1, 4. and, Isa. 49.6, 8. and, Isa. 53.10, 12. and, Tit. 1.2, 3. and, Heb. 12.2. <HI>The Joy set before Him.</HI>]</P>
<P>Our Lord-Redeemer then Accepted the <HI>Charge</HI> thus Committed unto Him. He took the very <HI>Names</HI> of those, for whom He would become an <HI>Atonement</HI> and an <HI>Advocate.</HI> He Promised unto His Eternal <HI>Father,</HI> That He would not only be∣come a <HI>Man,</HI> but also be <HI>Born of a Woman,</HI> and be <HI>Made under the Law,</HI> and <HI>Appear in the Form of a Servant,</HI> and become <HI>Obedient unto the Death of the Cross,</HI> and thoroughly discharge the part of a <HI>Surety</HI> for His <HI>Chosen,</HI> and <HI>Save them unto the utter∣most.</HI> [See, Heb. 10.5, 7. and, Joh. 14.31.]</P>
<P>Hence it is, That the <HI>Chosen</HI> of God, even
<PB N="18" REF="001256_0019_0FB18A5AA7EE9860"/>
while they are yet in their Sins, are called, Joh. 10.16. <HI>The Sheep of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Yea, He vouchsafes to call them; Heb. 2.13. <HI>The Children which God has given me.</HI></P>
<P>Finally. There is a <HI>Special Intent</HI> in the Heart of God, and of our Lord Redeemer, that they who are <HI>Chosen</HI> by God, and <HI>Given</HI> to the Lord-Redeemer, shall have a <HI>Distinguished</HI> and <HI>Peculiar</HI> Share in His <HI>Redemption.</HI> Our Lord-Redeemer has Engaged, and Obeyed, and Suffered, with a <HI>Distinguishing</HI> and a <HI>Peculiar Eye,</HI> to those whom the <HI>Father has Given unto Him.</HI> The <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Success,</HI> of our Lords Engagement in the Work of <HI>Redemption,</HI> depends not meerly upon the <HI>Un∣certainties,</HI> of what Respect the <HI>Free-Will</HI> of Man, may <HI>happen</HI> in Time to show unto it. For so, it might <HI>happen,</HI> That <HI>no man</HI> at all should ever be the better for that <HI>Redemption:</HI> which must by no means be imagined! Our Lord, in the work of <HI>Redemption,</HI> has bought <HI>Faith</HI> for Some; He has bought this <HI>Favour</HI> for some, <HI>That they shall by Faith be brought actually to Enjoy the Benefits of His Redemption.</HI> Oh! Let none of the <HI>Faithful</HI> be so Ungrateful, as to say, <HI>My Faith is a Grace, which the Blood of my Redeemer never bought for me!</HI> If <HI>this Grace</HI> be <HI>Bought</HI> for any; the Grace, to Re∣ceive, and by Receiving to Enjoy, the <HI>Redemption</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; Then it must be <HI>Bought</HI> for a <HI>Special Number,</HI> who are known unto the Lord. Surely, The Great God never so fully <HI>Intended</HI> the <HI>Redemption</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<PB N="19" REF="001256_0020_0FB18A5BE419B6E8"/>
for those, who He from Eternity <HI>Fore-knew,</HI> would never come to partake in the Advantage of it, as for those whom, <HI>He Gave to the Lord-Re∣deemer.</HI> Never say, Sirs, Never say, That <HI>Peter</HI> was no more beholden to his <HI>Lord-Redeemer,</HI> than <HI>Judas!</HI></P>
<P>Well; But, my Hearers, Let us again make a Pause. We have before us a <HI>Truth,</HI> with which we are Singularly Illuminated: You shall see, what Incomparable <HI>Good,</HI> what <HI>Honey of the Rock,</HI> will presently be Dropping from it.</P>
<P>§. We will Enquire, first; <HI>Whether a Man may come to know, that he is from all Eternity in the Covenant of Redemption given by God the Father to our Lord-Redeemer?</HI></P>
<P>Yes; He may. And you that are now before the Lord, may immediately come to know, That God has <HI>Given</HI> you unto the Lord Jesus Christ. You may know it by this Unquestionable Symp∣tom. <HI>Do you give your selves unto the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST? One whom the <HI>Father had given</HI> to our Lord, came to <HI>know</HI> it, by his being Able to Say; 2 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I know whom I have believed, and I am perswaded that He is able to keep that which I have Committed unto Him.</HI> I will Say; Do you <HI>know,</HI> that you have so <HI>Believed</HI> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as to <HI>Commit your selves</HI> unto Him? The Lord-Redeemer says, <HI>My Son, Give me thy Heart.</HI> Is this now your Answer to the Lord-Redeemer? <HI>Lord, I would fain Give thee my Heart!
<PB N="20" REF="001256_0021_0FB18A5D9A720500"/>
Oh! Give me the Grace to give thee my Heart, and my All!</HI> Distressed Soul; Dost thou <HI>Give</HI> up thy self unto the Conduct of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as thy <HI>Shepherd,</HI> thy <HI>Great Shepherd,</HI> and thy <HI>Good Shepherd,</HI> wishing to be led by Him in the <HI>Pathes of Righteousness?</HI> Dost thou <HI>Give up</HI> thy self unto Him, with that Supplication, that Expectation; <HI>Lord, I am thine; Save me!</HI> It is then beyond all Question, That God from all Eternity has <HI>Given</HI> thee to thy <HI>Lord-Redeemer: Thy Name</HI> is in the List of those, for whom He did become a <HI>Lord-Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>Or, We will so express it. If a Man come into the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> he may be sure, that he is in the <HI>Covenant of Redemption.</HI> There is a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> wherein the Great GOD offers to be <HI>Our God.</HI> All the <HI>Sure Mercies</HI> of our <HI>Love∣ly</HI> JESUS are offered unto us, in this <HI>Everlasting Covenant.</HI> Have you Really and Heartily come into this <HI>Covenant?</HI> Have you Embraced God the <HI>Father,</HI> as your <HI>Father;</HI> God the <HI>Son,</HI> as your <HI>Sa∣viour;</HI> God the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as your <HI>Leader?</HI> And have you Resolved, That you will with His Help <HI>Live</HI> to Him, and <HI>Walk</HI> with Him, to the End of your Lives? Is this your wish: <HI>O Great God, be thou my God; O my God, make me thy Servant ac∣cording to thy Covenant.</HI> We read, Ezek. 16.8. <HI>I Entred into Covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest Mine.</HI> This I will say; The <HI>Covenant of Redemption</HI> did first make us <HI>the Lords,</HI> if in the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> we are become <HI>the Lords.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001256_0022_0FB18A5F095897E8"/>§. But we will next Enquire; <HI>Whether there be no Special Duties, wherein they that know them∣selves Given to the Lord-Redeemer in the Covenant of Redemption, should be thereby drawn to Glorify God?</HI></P>
<P>Many <HI>Duties,</HI> many <HI>Duties,</HI> become now in∣cumbent on you, O you whom the Lord has thus wonderfully comforted.</P>
<P>Methinks▪ The first of them should be, To <HI>Wonder</HI> at the Goodness of God unto us, and even unto us who are <HI>Sinners of the Gentiles,</HI> that we are admitted into the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the most Glorious Transaction that ever was. We have an Admis∣sion to an Acquaintance, with that Secret and Glorious Transaction, <HI>The Covenant of Redemption.</HI> We have Learnt the very Words, as I may say, of the Consultation that Passed between God the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> at the <HI>Council-Table</HI> of Hea∣ven, when there was none else present, but that Principal <HI>Secretary of State,</HI> the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, who has Revealed it. The <HI>Fifty Third</HI> Chapter of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> has a Copy of them. Oh! Wondrous <HI>Condescension</HI> of Him, who <HI>Humbles Himself to be∣hold the things that are done in Heaven,</HI> to tell us, pittiful Worms upon the Earth, what <HI>He Himself did in Heaven</HI> from all Eternity! Will any <HI>Pro∣testant</HI> call that, <HI>A Fiction,</HI> which is indeed the very Marrow and Substance of the <HI>Glorious Gos∣pel of the Blessed God;</HI> the very <HI>Fountain</HI> of all our <HI>Eternal Blessedness!</HI> O Sinful Ingratitude, unto Him, that has even <HI>Lifted us up to Heaven,</HI> by communicating unto us, these <HI>Deep things of the Spirit of God!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001256_0023_0FB18A62062EE6A8"/>But then, there Ensues another point of <HI>Practice</HI> for us, which is indeed the <HI>Sum</HI> of all <HI>Practical Christianity:</HI> Tis that; Heb. 12.2. <HI>Looking unto</HI> JESUS. Whither shall we now Look for every thing, but unto Him, unto whom the <HI>Father</HI> has <HI>Given</HI> us, that He may <HI>Give</HI> all unto us; that is to say, Our Lord JESUS CHRIST. This, This must be the continual Sentiment of our Minds; <Q>If ever I come to <HI>Eternal Blessedness,</HI> it is my <HI>Lord-Redeemer</HI> that must bring me to it; Why has God the <HI>Father given</HI> me to the <HI>Lord-Re∣deemer?</HI> Tis because my <HI>Lord-Redeemer</HI> is to do all for me. <HI>Unto thee then, O Lord-Redeemer, I Look for all.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> What remains is; <HI>That all that are from Eternity Chosen by God, and given to the Lord-Re∣deemer, shall in due Time come unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Link in the <HI>Golden Chain of Salvation;</HI> Rom. 8.30. <HI>Whom He did Predestinate, them He also called.</HI> It is a <HI>Chain</HI> that shall never be broken: It lies not at the Arbitrary <HI>Determination</HI> of a Sin∣ners <HI>Free-Will,</HI> whether it shall be broken or no. God will so move by His Powerful <HI>Grace</HI> upon the <HI>Will,</HI> of such as are <HI>Chosen</HI> for Himself, and <HI>Given</HI> to His Christ, that it shall not be broken. Tho' we do not know the <HI>Way of the Spirit,</HI> in this illustrious part of the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> over the World, nor <HI>After what manner,</HI> the God who <HI>forms the Spirit of Man within him,</HI> does Effectually move His People by His <HI>Verticordious Influences,</HI> and yet
<PB N="23" REF="001256_0024_0FB18A6535944348"/>
not Extinguish or Overwhelm the <HI>Free-Will</HI> of the <HI>Rational Creature:</HI> Yet this we know, The <HI>Determination</HI> of this point, <HI>Who Will,</HI> and, <HI>Who Will not,</HI> be brought unto the <HI>Faith of Gods Elect,</HI> is not left unto such a <HI>Contingency,</HI> as what the <HI>Free-Will</HI> of a Fallen and Corrupt <HI>Man,</HI> only address'd with a <HI>Moral Swasion,</HI> shall please to do concerning it. The <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> will with his own <HI>Peculiar Influences,</HI> infallibly bring about the <HI>Effectual Vocation,</HI> of all those whom He has <HI>Chosen</HI> for Himself, and <HI>Given</HI> to His Christ; and, what tho' the <HI>Manner</HI> of His <HI>Working</HI> upon the Minds of His People, be not fully to be <HI>Compre∣hended?</HI> It is no little part of the <HI>Homage,</HI> which we owe unto the Glorious GOD, Humbly to admire and adore His Conduct, and acknowledge it <HI>Incomprehensible!</HI></P>
<P>But in this <HI>Wilderness</HI> I find <HI>Giants</HI> to be En∣countred with.</P>
<P>There is a very Numerous party of men, in the World, who hold no <HI>Grace</HI> necessary to bring a Sinner into a State of Salvation, but only that which they call <HI>Moral Grace,</HI> or, <HI>Moral Swa∣sion;</HI> and which amounts to no more than a <HI>Rational Proposal</HI> of our Duty, <HI>To turn from Sin to God in Christ,</HI> with <HI>Reasonable Considerations,</HI> to Excite men unto the doing of this their Duty. <HI>They Deny,</HI> any <HI>purpose of Mercy</HI> in God, for any, but what may be obliged by a <HI>Fore-sight</HI> of the <HI>Good Use,</HI> which a Sinner may make of his own <HI>Free-will. They Deny,</HI> all Gracious <HI>Qualities,</HI> created
<PB N="24" REF="001256_0025_0FB18A66649B79A8"/>
in the Heart, or <HI>Will</HI> of a Repenting Sinner by the Spirit of God, and reject the Notion of <HI>In∣fused Habits. They Deny,</HI> all such Sanctifying O∣perations of the Almighty <HI>Spirit,</HI> on the <HI>Will</HI> of a Sinner, as will or can <HI>Certainly</HI> incline it to act, or incline it any more <HI>to act,</HI> than <HI>not to act.</HI> All that they will allow <HI>Grace</HI> to do, is to <HI>Pro∣pose</HI> unto the <HI>Will,</HI> and leave the <HI>Will Indifferent,</HI> and leave it wholly unto the <HI>Determination</HI> of the <HI>Free-Will</HI> in the Sinner, whether the Proposal shall have any Effect or no. Tis no <HI>Special Grace,</HI> which they allow; there is in it, no more done by the <HI>Spirit of Faith,</HI> for them that are <HI>Saved,</HI> than for them that are <HI>Damned.</HI> In the mean time, they ascribe such a Vast Power unto the <HI>Will</HI> of Sinful Man, that they Expressly assert, <HI>The Will of man cannot be determined unto its Acts by any Irresistible motion,</HI> [Ne ab ipso Deo quidem!] <HI>no, not from the Great God Himself.</HI> They main∣tain, That when all the <HI>Works of Grace</HI> in order to the Conversion of a Sinner are past upon the <HI>Will,</HI> it still remains in the <HI>Free Power</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> to Convert, or not Convert it self. The Lord shall not have <HI>His Will▪</HI> the <HI>Predestination</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Undertaking</HI> of CHRIST, and the <HI>Appli∣cation</HI> of the SPIRIT; shall all come to nothing, if the <HI>Will</HI> of Sinful Man, will please to Resist it all; The Great GOD can <HI>do nothing</HI> to over∣come the <HI>Resistance!</HI> Thus is there an <HI>Idol</HI> Set up, which has more <HI>People,</HI> and <HI>Nations,</HI> and <HI>Languages,</HI> falling down before it, than there did
<PB N="25" REF="001256_0026_0FB18A68144D28A8"/>
before that in the Plain of <HI>Dura</HI> of old. What if the Disposition of a <HI>carnal Mind,</HI> so generally, to Dethrone the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> and Set up the <HI>Will</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> in the Throne of God, should be found, but a <HI>Refined Idolatry</HI> after all?</P>
<P>It is of Great Consequence to the Interests of our Holy Religion, that we should set before you the <HI>Dangerous Tendency</HI> of these Opinions.</P>
<P>And, first, Can it be any other than a thing full of <HI>Danger</HI> unto the Souls of Men, to be so In∣sensible of the <HI>Wounds</HI> which <HI>Original Sin</HI> has given unto all the <HI>Faculties</HI> of our <HI>Souls,</HI> and par∣ticularly unto our <HI>Wills?</HI> While men say, [as the Successors of the ancient <HI>Enemies of Grace,</HI> do expressly say, and therein indeed <HI>wax worse and worse than</HI> the Old <HI>Pelagians,</HI>] <HI>That no immediate Operation of the Spirit upon the Mind or Will, is need∣ful for any one, that he may believe:</HI> they proclame, that they have little Sense of any <HI>Corruption</HI> in the <HI>Will</HI> of Sinful Man. If the <HI>Will</HI> of a <HI>Sinner,</HI> needs nothing but the Setting of an <HI>Object</HI> before it, wherein is it more Corrupt or Feeble, than the <HI>Will</HI> of an <HI>Angel?</HI> Certainly, very Defective is that <HI>Repentance,</HI> in which the <HI>Corruption</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> is no more Considered!</P>
<P>These men say, That the <HI>Preaching of the Gospel is granted mostly unto those whose Vertues deserve it;</HI> and all <HI>other Grace</HI> is granted still unto the <HI>worthy Hearers of the Gospel.</HI> Any good Act which a man did of himself, on the account whereof <HI>Grace</HI> is vouchsafed, was counted <HI>Merit,</HI> in the Sense of
<PB N="26" REF="001256_0027_0FB18A695EBAF180"/>
the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> who branded all pretences to it, with an <HI>Anathematizing</HI> Detestation. Ac∣cording to these men, all <HI>Grace</HI> is given accor∣ding to <HI>Merit.</HI> Wretched Inconsistency! Sirs, If it be of <HI>Merit,</HI> it is no more of <HI>Grace?</HI> Accor∣ding to them, The Great God can from all Eter∣nity Chuse none, but those, who He foresees, that by the Good Use of their <HI>Free-Will</HI> they will <HI>Merit</HI> the <HI>Election of Grace.</HI> Yea, All the Promises in the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> also, are Suspended on a Condition, of something to be performed by the Power of our <HI>Free-Will,</HI> assisted by no <HI>Grace</HI> at all but only a <HI>Perswasion,</HI> or <HI>Proposal,</HI> which does no∣thing to Enable it. And how destructive will such a Proud conceit of our own <HI>Merit</HI> be, un∣to that <HI>Humility,</HI> which is the peculiar Spirit and Glory of <HI>Christianity!</HI></P>
<P>He that only <HI>Advises</HI> another to do a thing, <HI>does not</HI> the Thing himself, but <HI>Expects</HI> it from <HI>A∣nother.</HI> So then, the Sinner does, according to these Opinions, <HI>Convert himself,</HI> and <HI>Quicken him∣self!</HI> O Converts, Be not so Unthankful, as to say concerning your own <HI>Conversion, Tis owing to my self! I am no more beholden to the Grace of God, than they that are yet in their Sins!</HI> Tis to be fear∣ed, You are yet <HI>Unholy,</HI> if so <HI>Unthankful.</HI> The True Strain of <HI>Christianity,</HI> was long ago dictated unto us; <HI>Not unto us, O Lord, Not unto us; But unto thy Name give all the Glory!</HI> The Church in its <HI>Childhood</HI> was <HI>trained up</HI> in this way; Now we are <HI>Old,</HI> Let us <HI>not,</HI> Let us <HI>never depart from it.</HI></P>

<HI>Holy,</HI> and <HI>Just,</HI> and <HI>Good?</HI> That He would <HI>Ef∣fectually</HI> bring Home to Himself, all those that are about us? If it be in our own <HI>power,</HI> why do we put it into our <HI>Prayer?</HI> If it be not <HI>God,</HI> who does this for us, by His <HI>Grace,</HI> but we do it for our selves, why do we go to <HI>God</HI> for it? Whenever these people <HI>Pray,</HI> That their own, or other <HI>wills</HI> may be <HI>Subdued</HI> unto that which is <HI>Right,</HI> their <HI>Prayers</HI> contradict their <HI>Principles.</HI> Let none of our Hearers Entertain <HI>Principles,</HI> that have such a Tendency, to confound their <HI>Pray∣ers.</HI></P>
<P>They are <HI>Principles</HI> which Rob the Great God of the <HI>Glory</HI> which is for ever due unto Him.

man may do? Tis <HI>Uncertain,</HI> if it be not <HI>Determin'd</HI> by God. What an Eclipse is there brought on the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, if there be no <HI>Certain Object</HI> fixed for the <HI>Mercy?</HI> If it be a <HI>Mercy</HI> only unto <HI>Vertues,</HI> and not unto <HI>Persons?</HI> If it be a <HI>Mercy,</HI> that has not <HI>Ensured</HI> the Salvation of any one man upon Earth? They tell us, That we <HI>strait∣en</HI> the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God; tho' we show a vast Num∣ber of <HI>Subjects</HI> upon which it infallibly operates. The <HI>Universal Mercy</HI> which they talk of, has not <HI>Secured</HI> the Salvation of any one person in the World. And it is a <HI>Mercy,</HI> which cannot ex∣press it self, but where it finds a <HI>Merit</HI> or a <HI>Mo∣tive</HI> in the Creature. A <HI>Mercy</HI> without <HI>Grace!</HI> O <HI>Mercy!</HI> How art thou <HI>Disgraced!</HI></P>
<P>What an <HI>Abridgment</HI> is there come upon the <HI>Dominion</HI> of God, if the <HI>Will</HI> of man cannot be Ruled by him? Why should we so rise up a∣gainst the <HI>Government</HI> of God, as to maintain, that our <HI>Will</HI> must not be Touch'd, but be such an Exempted, and <HI>Self-Governing</HI> thing, that a Touch from God must violate it? Yea, What a <HI>Limitation</HI> do we go to put upon <HI>Omnipo∣tency?</HI></P>
<P>By these <HI>Principles</HI> the <HI>Redemption</HI> of a Glo∣rious CHRIST, has unsufferable Indignities cast upon it. Upon <HI>them,</HI> No Regenerate per∣son may say, <Q>My Lord Jesus Christ has pur∣chased for me, that Faith, that Repentance, that Holiness, which are the greatest Bles∣sings that ever Heaven bestow'd upon me!</Q>

Christian, Thy Soul upon due Delibration, can∣not but abhor the Thoughts of <HI>this;</HI> That when <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> have Enriched thee, there should nothing be ascribed unto the <HI>Purchase</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST on that occasion? That such <HI>Spiritual Blessings,</HI> must be no more than meer <HI>Contingencies!</HI> Yea, if it must be, as these would have it, The <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath not <HI>certainly</HI> purchased the Salvation, of <HI>any one</HI> Person in the World. Tho' the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord have been offered up, yet, it seems, there is no <HI>certainty,</HI> that any <HI>One</HI> Person shall ever have any Saving Advantage by it. The <HI>Uncertain Will</HI> of Man alone, must have the Honour to <HI>Deter∣mine</HI> it.</P>
<P>What an Affront is given by these <HI>Principles,</HI> to the Holy SPIRIT? They allow Him to do no∣thing for us, but only to dispense unto us a <HI>Com∣mon Light,</HI> such as is enjoy'd even by the <HI>Children of Darkness;</HI> And that <HI>Light</HI> so ineffectual, that the <HI>Will</HI> is not <HI>Effectually Inclined</HI> by it.

<P>But there is no End. The mischiefs, <HI>cannot be Numbred.</HI> There is no Enumeration of all the Evils, in these <HI>Crooked Principles.</HI> Yet I must make an End; and I do it, with telling you, That one great Reason, why you are now warned with so much Vehemency against these <HI>Principles,</HI> is, The <HI>Strong Temptation</HI> which they lay before you,
<PB N="32" REF="001256_0033_0FB18A756C5EFE58"/>
to <HI>Neglect the Great Salvation,</HI> and persist in the course of Sin, which will bring upon you a ter∣rible <HI>Destruction from God.</HI> If <HI>Conversion</HI> be in your <HI>own Power,</HI> you will think, that you may take your <HI>own Time</HI> for it; and that you may go on in a course of Sin, till you may see your <HI>own Time</HI> to break it off. If no <HI>Darkness,</HI> and no <HI>Hardness</HI> can be contracted, but what your own <HI>Will</HI> may shake off at pleasure, and there be no Hazard of a <HI>Peradventure,</HI> whether God may give you <HI>Repentance,</HI> What Encouragement will this give unto Sinful Men, to <HI>go on still in their Trespasses,</HI> till they see themselves likely to breathe no longer among their Fellow-Sinners in the World?</P>
<P>I apprehended if <HI>High Time,</HI> that my Country, should be call'd upon, to watch against the <HI>Growth</HI> of these <HI>Tares,</HI> or I had not now so much insist∣ed on it. We will go on to clear our <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>
<P>§. Let it be asked, First; <HI>Why shall all that are Chosen by God, and given to Christ, come unto Him?</HI></P>
<P>Why? Because the <HI>Honour</HI> of God and of <HI>Christ,</HI> make it requisite, that it should be so; and there is nothing to hinder, or to render why it should not be so. Should they that are <HI>Chosen of God,</HI> miss of <HI>Eternal Blessedness,</HI> the Counsels of God would be defeated. Should they that are <HI>Given to Christ,</HI> miss of <HI>Eternal Blessedness,</HI> the Fidelity or Ability of Christ would be blemished. The glorious LORD will never come under such Im∣putations.
<PB N="33" REF="001256_0034_0FB18A7922B5E8F8"/>
But if men do not <HI>Come</HI> unto the Lord, they cannot but miss of <HI>Eternal Blessedness,</HI> Tis a <HI>Faithful Saying,</HI> and worthy to be trembled at; Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that Believeth not the Son, shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be, Next, asked; <HI>How shall they that are Chosen by God, and Given to Christ, come unto Him?</HI></P>
<P>How? Their <HI>Coming</HI> to the Lord, is by <HI>Be∣lieving</HI> on Him. Our Lord sayes as much as this comes to; Joh. 6.35. <HI>He that cometh to me, is he that Believeth on me.</HI> They that are <HI>Chosen of God,</HI> and <HI>Given to Christ,</HI> shall <HI>come</HI> unto the Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST, as unto their <HI>Priest,</HI> their <HI>Pro∣phet,</HI> their <HI>King;</HI> They shall <HI>come</HI> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, with <HI>Petition</HI> to Him, and with <HI>Dependence</HI> on Him, for His <HI>Precious Benefits;</HI> They shall <HI>come</HI> unto Him, with such Dispositions; <Q><HI>Lord,</HI> I Repair to thee, <HI>Lord,</HI> I Rely on thee, for <HI>Grace,</HI> for <HI>Glory,</HI> for <HI>Every Good Thing.</HI> I Re∣solve to <HI>Obey</HI> thee, and Look for that <HI>Eternal Salvation,</HI> whereof thou art the <HI>Author, to as ma∣ny as Obey thee!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Tis what will come to pass, most Assuredly, most Undoubtedly.</P>
<P>§. But now there is a DEHORTATION to be managed against an Error and a Folly, fre∣quently committed among us. It is a Folly, which we daily see Raging among us; it Stabs the Souls of Multitudes. Multitudes <HI>accuse</HI> the <HI>Predestination</HI> of God, as the cause of their
<PB N="34" REF="001256_0035_0FB18A7C1A877D18"/>
Impenitent Unbelief; Or at Least, from this <HI>Predestination</HI> they go to <HI>Excuse</HI> themselves in their Impenitency. They Argue, [<HI>Argue,</HI> did I say? I should rather say, They <HI>Cavil:</HI>] at his rate;</P>
<P><Q>I don't know, Whether I am <HI>Chosen of God,</HI> or no. None but the <HI>Elect</HI> shall be <HI>Saved.</HI> If I am not <HI>Elect,</HI> unto what purpose is it for me to seek to be <HI>Saved?</HI> If I am <HI>Elect,</HI> what need I trouble my self? I cannot miss of being <HI>Saved.</HI> I don't know, whether I am <HI>Given to Christ,</HI> or no. It may be, the <HI>Death of Christ</HI> was never Design'd for me. How can I plead the <HI>Death of Christ,</HI> when, it may be, I am none of those for whom it was Design'd. If I perish, how can I help it? It is but what the Lord has Ordered.</Q></P>

<P>Him that Cometh to Me I will in no Wise cast out.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AND <HI>is this Thy Voice,</HI> O our Lord RE∣DEEMER? It is verily so. And the sweetest voice that ever was heard a∣mong the Sinful Children of Men. Why do not we <HI>Lift up our Voice,</HI> and weep; and with a weeping <HI>Faith</HI> give that <HI>Echo</HI> to it; <HI>Lord, I come unto thee: I will in no wise cast off thy Favour!</HI></P>
<P>That short and sweet Sentence, which we are now taking from the Gracious Lips of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, has been Employ'd by His Almighty Spirit, for the Conversion of many Thousands. There are <HI>Holy Myriads,</HI> who have upon a <HI>Quickening</HI> from this very Word, <HI>come</HI> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and found Him as Good as His Word. There are Bright
<PB N="44" REF="001256_0045_0FB18A8FA3FA01B8"/>
<HI>Constellations</HI> of Saints in the Heavenly World, who were, by this very Call brought Home un∣to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and at last into that World. Oh! that this <HI>Faithful Saying</HI> may find the same <HI>worthy Acceptation</HI> with you, My Hearers, which it has had with Multitudes that have gone before you!</P>
<P>Our Glorious Lord-REDEEMER, having first comforted Himself under the sad sight, which He had in the general, and criminal and obsti∣nate <HI>Unbelief</HI> of His Hearers; first comforted Himself with the Assurance which He had, <HI>That all His Chosen should come unto Him:</HI> He proceeds unto the comforting of His <HI>Chosen,</HI> who do <HI>Come</HI> unto Him; Comforting of them with an As∣surance, <HI>That He will make them welcome.</HI></P>
<P>Shall I observe, That the <HI>First</HI> Thing before us, is, The <HI>Duty</HI> of a Sinner? I hope, you take this for granted. Certainly, a <HI>Duty</HI> of greater Importance, a <HI>Duty</HI> of better Consequence, was never set before a <HI>Sinner. <HI>To come unto the Lord Iesus Christ.</HI></HI> This is the <HI>Duty,</HI> which must be done, by every Sinner that will be Saved; the <HI>Duty,</HI> which the Eternal Happi∣ness or Misery of us all does most of all turn upon.</P>
<P>But we will then Observe; That the <HI>Next</HI> Thing is, A <HI>Promise</HI> to the Sinner who does this <HI>Duty.</HI> The <HI>Expression</HI> is <HI>Negative. <HI>I will in no wise cast him out.</HI></HI> In the Original, the <HI>Negative</HI> is Doubled; q. d. <HI>I will not cast
<PB N="45" REF="001256_0046_0FB18A916A7A7F18"/>
him out; No, will I not.</HI> But the <HI>Intention</HI> is <HI>posi∣tive.</HI> Yea, there is more in the <HI>Intention</HI> than can be cloathed with any <HI>Expression.</HI> Our LORD will not <HI>Cast us cut.</HI> Lord, <HI>What wilt thou then do unto us!</HI> Why, He will <HI>do all that needs to be done,</HI> that we may be brought unto Everlast∣ing Happiness; He will do <HI>beyond all that we can Ask or Think;</HI> He will <HI>Save us unto the uttermost.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine of God our Saviour</HI> which now calls for our Attention, is This.</P>
<Q>Our Great <HI>SAVIOUR,</HI> will not Reject any Sinner that comes unto Him; No, tho' the Sin of that Sinner be never so great; But He will bestow His Great Salvation, upon all who diligently Seek Him.</Q>
<P>My Hearers, What, what is the Turning point, of our Everlasting Blessedness? <HI>Hearken Dili∣gently;</HI> For I am going to tell you.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> All that would be <HI>Saved,</HI> must <HI>Come unto the</HI> Great SAVIOUR; Yea, all that <HI>shall</HI> be <HI>Sa∣ved, will</HI> do so.</P>
<P>This will presently be determined, by but knowing, <HI>What it is to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Who can Interpret it so well, as our LORD Himself? His interpretation, which is infinitely to be Rely'd upon, was, That a <HI>Coming</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="001256_0047_0FB18A929E2B0D90"/>
to Him, is a <HI>Belief</HI> in Him. As it was said, <HI>He that cometh to God must believe;</HI> so we may say, <HI>To Believe, is to Come unto our Lord.</HI> Is it indeed so? Then see what will come of it: We are told by <HI>Truth</HI> it self, Mark 16.16. <HI>He that Belie∣veth shall be Saved; but he that Believeth not, shall he Damned.</HI></P>
<P>We have all the Reason imaginable to pro∣ceed upon this Action. We will briefly De∣scribe the <HI>Action,</HI> of, <HI>Coming unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</HI> And we will Beseech the God of all Grace, to Dispose and Assist us all, unto the <HI>Doing</HI> of this <HI>Action,</HI> while we are <HI>Hearing</HI> of it. <HI>O Spirit of Grace, come down upon us, with thy Gracious Influences!</HI></P>
<P>The Phrase, <HI>To Come unto the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> we are sensible, it is <HI>Metaphorical;</HI> We are sen∣sible, that FAITH is the thing meant in the <HI>Me∣taphor:</HI> The most <HI>Precious Grace</HI> that a Sinner can be inspired withal!</P>
<P>The Action of a True FAITH, has more than one Resemblance, in the Oracles of God. It is Resembled unto the Action of the <HI>Eye,</HI> and called, <HI>A Looking to the Lord;</HI> unto the Action of the <HI>Ear,</HI> and called, <HI>An Hearing, that the Soul may Live;</HI> unto the Action of the <HI>Mouth,</HI> and called, <HI>A Feeding on the Lord;</HI> And unto the Acti∣on of the <HI>Hand,</HI> for which it is called, <HI>A Receiv∣ing of Him.</HI> Consider, O Soul, consider what <HI>Action of the Soul,</HI> can answer to every one of these Terms; Fall into such a <HI>Full Action;</HI> and
<PB N="47" REF="001256_0048_0FB18A9429B40680"/>
Lift up thy Cry unto thy Saviour; <Q><HI>O Glorious Lord;</HI> I Desire to <HI>See</HI> thy Beauties; I desire to <HI>Hear</HI> thy Counsils; I desire to <HI>Feed</HI> and <HI>Feast</HI> on thine Excellencies; And I desire to <HI>Take</HI> all thy Benefits!</Q></P>
<P>But now, the <HI>Foot</HI> also must afford an Action, by which a Saving FAITH shall be set forth un∣to us. Tis a <HI>Coming</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST. And many <HI>Motions</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI> are contained in it. Yea, <HI>Awake my whole Soul, and All that is within me, to do this Noble Action!</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>Come unto the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST, is, with a Lively FAITH to ADDRESS Him, as the CHRIST of God, and <HI>for such Blessings</HI> as are to be Desired and Expected from the CHRIST of God. More Particularly,</P>
<P>First; The <HI>Address</HI> with which our <HI>Faith</HI> must <HI>Come</HI> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is to <HI>Ac∣knowledge Him as the CHRIST of God.</HI> We do not <HI>come</HI> aright unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST if we do not <HI>come</HI> with that Acknowledgment; Joh. 6.69. <HI>We believe and are sure, That thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.</HI> When we <HI>come</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, it is necessary, that we have some <HI>Knowledge</HI> of His Admirable <HI>Person;</HI> yea, that we Admire Him as a Person <HI>Altogether Lovely.</HI> In <HI>coming</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, we must Behold Him, as <HI>God and Man in One Person;</HI> we must Behold Him as the Only <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and Man; we must Be∣hold Him, and make that Confession of Him,
<PB N="48" REF="001256_0049_0FB18A969BD62110"/>
Joh. 4.42. <HI>This is indeed the CHRIST, the Saviour of the World▪</HI> And that Confession; Act. 4.12. <HI>There is no other Name given among men, whereby we must be Saved:</HI> And that Confession; Heb. 5.9. <HI>He becomes the Author of Eternal Salvation, unto all them that Obey Him.</HI> We do not <HI>come</HI> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, if we do not Confess Him to be, The <HI>Son of God</HI> Assuming <HI>our Nature,</HI> and with a <HI>Commission</HI> from God becoming <HI>our Sa∣viour:</HI> An <HI>Offering</HI> and a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to God for us, and now our <HI>Advocate</HI> in the Heavens, and <HI>Sitting at the Right Hand of God</HI> as the <HI>Governour</HI> of the World.</P>
<P>The Language of our Souls, in <HI>coming</HI> to our Lord JESUS CHRIST, must be of this Tenour.</P>
<P><Q>O Glorious JESUS; Thou art the CHRIST, <HI>the Son of the Living GOD.</HI> Thou art the <HI>Priest,</HI> whose <HI>Blood cleanses from all Sin.</HI> Thou art the <HI>Prophet,</HI> who doest <HI>Make us Wise unto Salvation.</HI> Thou art the <HI>King,</HI> who doest make us Victori∣ous over the <HI>Powers of Darkness.</HI> Thou art the <HI>Wonder of the Heavens,</HI> and Worthy to be <HI>the De∣sire of all Nations</HI> upon Earth. Oh! There is <HI>None to be Compared</HI> with thee! There is no <HI>Blessedness</HI> comparable to that of an <HI>interest</HI> in thee.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Address</HI> with which our <HI>Faith</HI> must come unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is to <HI>Desire</HI> and <HI>Expect</HI> from Him, such <HI>Blessings,</HI> as the CHRIST of God bestows upon His People.</P>
<P>We cannot <HI>come</HI> unto the Lord JESUS
<PB N="49" REF="001256_0050_0FB18A97F6DBAF98"/>
CHRIST, Except we see our selves <HI>Fallen</HI> from God; <HI>Fallen</HI> and Plunged into horrible Circum∣stances: Except we see our selves utterly <HI>unable</HI> to Recover our selves out of our Sinful and Wo∣ful Circumstances. In our <HI>coming</HI> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, we must have that Anguish on our Minds; Rom. 7.24. O <HI>Wretched One that I am?</HI> Such, even such must be our Soliloquies; These must be our Thoughts, and our Griefs before the Lord.</P>
<P><Q>I have <HI>Sinned,</HI> I have <HI>Sinned!</HI> And by <HI>Sin</HI> I am now become, how very <HI>Miserable!</HI> I am De∣prived of the <HI>Favour</HI> of GOD, and of the <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> of GOD, and of the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD. O Dreadful Miseries! I am Exposed unto the Do∣minion of <HI>Lust,</HI> and unto the Tyranny of <HI>Satan,</HI> and unto an Everlasting <HI>Banishment</HI> from God, into <HI>Outer Darkness,</HI> among the forlorn <HI>Vessels of Wrath.</HI> O Fearful Miseries! O <HI>wretched One that I am! who shall Deliver me!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is our <HI>Deliverer.</HI> Our <HI>Design</HI> in <HI>coming</HI> to our Lord JESUS CHRIST, must be, to obtain <HI>Deliverance.</HI></P>
<P>What? May we be so <HI>Selfish,</HI> as to aim at our own <HI>Salvation</HI> in <HI>coming</HI> to our Lord Jesus Christ? Yes; Tis a Laudable <HI>Selfishness.</HI> A <HI>Salvation▪</HI> that rescues a Sinner from his <HI>Enmity</HI> to GOD; A <HI>Sal∣vation,</HI> that restores a Sinner to the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of GOD; A <HI>Salvation▪</HI> whereby GOD shall have Re∣venues of Eternal <HI>Glory</HI> from the Sinner: Oh, be not Afraid of Seeking such a <HI>Salvation:</HI> It will be
<PB N="50" REF="001256_0051_0FB18A9975A1C068"/>
no Faulty <HI>Self-seeking,</HI> you may be Satisfyed.</P>
<P>But then, What are the <HI>Blessings</HI> to be sought from our Saviour, in His <HI>Great Salvation?</HI></P>
<P>When we <HI>come</HI> unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, He puts this Demand unto us; Matt. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.32. <HI>What will ye that I shall do unto you?</HI> We must render a fit Answer to this Demand. Our Answer must be; to this Purpose.</P>
<P><Q>Glorious REDEEMER; I <HI>come</HI> unto thee for <HI>Atonement.</HI> Oh! Let me stand before God in thy Spotless and Perfect <HI>Righteousness!</HI> Oh! Let thy <HI>Intercession Save me to the Uttermost!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Our Answer must be more than so; It must have this in it.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Lord,</HI> I <HI>come</HI> unto thee for <HI>Instruction.</HI> Oh! Guide me in the <HI>Way of Peace!</HI> Oh! cause me to know the <HI>Things of my Everlasting Peace!</HI></Q></P>
<P>And there must be yet more in our Answer▪ It must go thus far.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Lord,</HI> I <HI>come</HI> unto thee for <HI>Government.</HI> Oh! Conquer my Rebellious Heart, and Incline me to Love and Keep thy <HI>Laws;</HI> Oh! make me a Conqueror over all my <HI>Spiritual Adversaries!</HI></Q></P>
<P>These and such as these Blessings, are we to Propound, in our <HI>coming</HI> unto our Lord.</P>
<P>That our <HI>Address</HI> in our <HI>coming</HI> may not mis∣carry, there are Two Qualifications of it, that are to be Endeavoured.</P>
<P>First. We may not <HI>Separate</HI> the <HI>Blessings</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> for which we <HI>come</HI> unto Him. God has <HI>Joyn'd</HI> them; God will not own the Man that
<PB N="51" REF="001256_0052_0FB18A9ADD9B3940"/>
<HI>Parts</HI> them. We must be for a <HI>whole</HI> CHRIST, and for <HI>Every Article</HI> of the <HI>Salvation</HI> which a CHRIST has to confer upon us. We must be for a CHRIST, that will give us <HI>Repentance</HI> as well as <HI>Remission of Sins;</HI> and for being <HI>Sanctified</HI> as well as <HI>Justified.</HI> We read, Col. 1.19. <HI>In Him there does all Fulness dwell.</HI> And we must come for <HI>All,</HI> if we would not be put off with <HI>None.</HI> A <HI>Genuine Faith</HI> has many <HI>Errands</HI> upon which it <HI>comes</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST. It is not a <HI>Genuine Faith,</HI> which does <HI>Neglect</HI> any of them, <HI>Despise</HI> any of them. It is not enough, to <HI>come</HI> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, only that we may be brought into His <HI>Righteousness▪</HI> we must also Ponder on all the <HI>Maladies</HI> of our Souls, and Specify them <HI>All,</HI> and Mention them <HI>All,</HI> and Long for the Relief of them <HI>All;</HI> very Particularly. <Q><HI>Lord,</HI> my Mind is <HI>Ignorant;</HI> Oh, Do thou En∣lighten it. My Heart is <HI>Depraved;</HI> Oh, Do thou Rectify it. I have a <HI>Slothful</HI> Soul; Oh, Do thou make me <HI>Lively.</HI> I have a <HI>Barren</HI> Soul; Oh, Do thou make me <HI>Fruitful.</HI> I have a Soul inordi∣nately set upon the <HI>World;</HI> Oh! Do thou make me <HI>Heavenly.</HI> It is <HI>Proud;</HI> Extinguish, and Nul∣lify the <HI>Pride</HI> in my Soul. There is great <HI>Im∣purity</HI> in my Soul; Do thou Purify me, and make me <HI>Meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></Q> God will hear this <HI>Cry of the Humble!</HI></P>
<P>And then, Secondly; When we <HI>come</HI> to our <HI>Saviour</HI> for His <HI>Blessings,</HI> we are both to <HI>Desire</HI> them, and to <HI>Expect</HI> them. Our <HI>Faith</HI> must carry
<PB N="52" REF="001256_0053_0FB18A9D47646CF0"/>
us to a CHRIST for <HI>Salvation,</HI> on the <HI>Two Wings,</HI> of <HI>Prayer,</HI> and of <HI>Hope.</HI> In our <HI>coming</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, there must be a <HI>Petition</HI> to Him for Salvation; such a <HI>Petition</HI> as that; Psal. 116.4. <HI>I beseech thee, O Lord, to deliver my Soul.</HI> And there must be a <HI>Dependence</HI> on Him for Salvation; such a <HI>Dependence</HI> as that; Psal. 25.2. <HI>O my God, I Trust in thee.</HI> First, We are to <HI>Beg</HI> of our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> That He <HI>would</HI> undertake for us, and <HI>Guide us by Counsil and Bring us to Glory;</HI> And then, we are to <HI>Trust</HI> in Him, that He <HI>will</HI> do so. First we are to <HI>Commit</HI> our selves unto our Lord; Saying, <Q>Lord, I am Thine, Save <HI>me,</HI> Lead <HI>me,</HI> Rule <HI>me!</HI></Q> And then we are to <HI>Com∣pose</HI> our selves, with some Degree of Confidence or Affiance, in the Lord; Saying, <Q><HI>Return to thy Rest, O my Soul,</HI> for the Lord will deal bounti∣fully with me!</Q></P>
<P>You now Apprehend, <HI>What</HI> it is, <HI>To come unto the Lord <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI></HI> Souls, When, when will you come <HI>Experimentially</HI> to Apprehend, what it is! Know, for your Excitation;</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> There is a <HI>Great</HI> SALVATION to be be∣stow'd upon all who thus <HI>Come unto the Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST <HI>Will in no wise cast out those that come unto Him.</HI> He will then <HI>Take</HI> them under His Conduct: But, Oh! Bles∣sed Conduct! Oh! Thrice and Four times Blessed they that are under such a Conduct! <HI>O Lord, How Great is thy Goodness, which thou hast
<PB N="53" REF="001256_0054_0FB18A9EA45FEF78"/>
Laid up for them, who put their Trust in thee!</HI> Be∣liever, Thy Great SAVIOUR has those Things to Do for thee, which will cause thee to Sing; [Psal. 126.3.] <HI>The Lord has done Great Things for me, whereof I am Glad!</HI></P>
<P>What will our Saviour do for them that <HI>Come</HI> unto Him? The Answer in short is, He will do <HI>all that</HI> for which they <HI>Come</HI> unto Him?</P>
<P>SALVATION is <HI>That,</HI> SALVATION is the <HI>End of our Faith.</HI> We are told; Act. 16.31. <HI>Be∣lieve on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou shalt be SAVED.</HI> But all that is Comprehended in that <HI>Salvation,</HI> 'tis inexpressible, 'tis inconceiva∣ble! Imagine, if you can, all that is compre∣hended in that Incomprehensible Catalogue of <HI>Blessings;</HI> 1 Cor. 1.30. <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Ho∣liness, and Redemption.</HI> Believer, These are all <HI>Thine,</HI> from the first moment of thy Believing.</P>
<P>Yet we will make a feeble Essay, to tell some∣thing of what our Great SAVIOUR, will do for them, whom <HI>He will not Cast out,</HI> but will <HI>Take in</HI> under the <HI>Shadow of His Wings.</HI></P>
<P>O <HI>Comers to the Lord;</HI> ADOPTION will be one point of your <HI>Salvation.</HI> We read; Joh. 1.12. <HI>As many as Received Him, to them He gave pow∣er to become the Sons of God.</HI> This, This is the Engagement of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; <Q><HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise</HI> Leave in the sad and black Family of <HI>Satan;</HI> I will make him a <HI>Child of God;</HI> an <HI>Heir of God.</HI> I will give him a Title to a matchless <HI>Inheritance;</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="001256_0055_0FB18AA030007B90"/>
He shall be a <HI>Joint-Heir with me;</HI> He shall <HI>In∣herit all things. My Father</HI> shall be <HI>His Father,</HI> and Bless Him wonderfully!</Q></P>
<P>Another point of your <HI>Salvation</HI> shall be your JUSTIFICATION. We read, Rom. 3.22. <HI>The Righteousness of God, is by the Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that Believe.</HI> This is the Engagement of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; <Q><HI>Him that Cometh unto me, I will in no wise</HI> Leave under the <HI>Wrath of God.</HI> God shall be <HI>Reconci∣led</HI> unto him. Tho' God has been <HI>Angry</HI> with him, the <HI>Anger</HI> shall be turned away. All Sin shall be <HI>Forgiven</HI> him. He shall stand in the <HI>Favour</HI> of God; be <HI>highly Favoured</HI> of the Lord. He shall have a claim to all the <HI>Blessedness of the Righteous.</HI> I will put my <HI>Righteousness</HI> upon him; A Robe outshining the Splendor of the brightest Angels in Heaven!</Q></P>
<P>Another point of your <HI>Salvation</HI> shall be your SANCTIFICATION. We read, Act. 26.18. We are <HI>Sanctified by Faith.</HI> There is the En∣gagement of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: <Q><HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise</HI> Leave un∣der the <HI>Power of Sin.</HI> I will make him a <HI>Tem∣ple</HI> of God, and <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion</HI> over him. I will knock off the Chains of Hell from his Mind; and <HI>Enlarge his Heart</HI> so that he shall <HI>Run the way of my Commandments.</HI> I will give him a <HI>New Heart,</HI> a <HI>Soft Heart,</HI> a <HI>Clean Heart;</HI> and I will incline his Heart unto all the Things that are <HI>Holy, and Just, and Good.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="001256_0056_0FB18AA19DA9C000"/>This is not All. Your <HI>Salvation</HI> must have a Consummation, in <HI>Heavenly Glory;</HI> in the <HI>Riches of the Glory of the Inheritance</HI> reserved for the Saints in another World. We read, Joh. 6.47. <HI>Verily, Verily, I say unto you, He that Believeth on me, hath Everlasting Life.</HI> Thus does our Lord JESUS CHRIST Engage Himself; <Q><HI>Him that cometh un∣to me, I will in no wise cast out,</HI> into the <HI>Outer Darkness,</HI> where the Ungodly shall be for ever Exiled from God. No; At the close of his <HI>Earthly Pilgrimage</HI> I will take his Immortal Spi∣rit into an <HI>Heavenly Paradise,</HI> where it shall be Cloathed with <HI>Garments of Light.</HI> At the Last Day, I will Restore his <HI>Body</HI> to his <HI>Spirit,</HI> no longer subject unto <HI>Corruption;</HI> and I will take him into the <HI>Holy City,</HI> where he shall be <HI>Filled with all the Fulness of God</HI> for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P>And are they such Things as these, that our Saviour will do for them that <HI>Come</HI> unto Him? Verily, They are. Oh! Great <HI>Salvation!</HI> Oh! Saviour, Oh! Saviour; Before whom the great∣est that ever was, must vanish as a <HI>Shadow!</HI> Why do we not All immediately <HI>Come</HI> unto Him!</P>
<P>It may be, our extream <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and Wick∣edness, and Filthiness, and Unworthiness is our Discouragement. Indeed, we all have cause humbly to Declare with him; Luk. 7.7. <HI>Lord, I do not think my self worthy to come unto thee.</HI> Ne∣vertheless we have before us a marvellous Con∣solation.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="001256_0057_0FB18AA34CA0B638"/><HI>III.</HI> Our Great SAVIOUR will not <HI>Reject</HI> a∣ny <HI>Sinner,</HI> that <HI>Comes unto Him;</HI> no, <HI>tho' the Sin of that Sinner be never so Great.</HI> He has given His Word; Be he who, or what he will, <HI>I will in no wise cast him out. Sinner,</HI> Let not thy <HI>Sin∣fulness</HI> discourage thee, from <HI>Coming</HI> to thy <HI>Saviour!</HI></P>
<P>I will first, Argue thus. Did our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> ever <HI>cast out</HI> any of those, that came un∣to Him, <HI>in the Days of His Flesh,</HI> for any of His Favours! No, He Received <HI>All,</HI> He Relieved <HI>All;</HI> Yea, it was cast as a Reproach upon Him; Luk. 15.2. <HI>He receiveth Sinners.</HI> What was this, but a most obliging Intimation, That our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> will still give a Kind Entertainment un∣to <HI>All</HI> that <HI>come</HI> unto Him? Come unto thy SAVIOUR, O Soul, so <HI>Blind</HI> as to <HI>see</HI> nothing of the Things which are <HI>Invisible;</HI> O Soul, so <HI>Lame</HI> as to be unable to take a step in the <HI>Way of Holi∣ness;</HI> O Soul, <HI>Grievously Vexed with Devils,</HI> which throw thee into the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Passion,</HI> and into the <HI>Water</HI> of <HI>Company,</HI> and make thee <HI>Cut</HI> and <HI>Wound</HI> thy self among the <HI>Monuments of the Dead.</HI> Come unto thy <HI>Great Saviour:</HI> He will do as Illustri∣ous Things for thee, as any that were done in His <HI>Miracles</HI> of old.</P>
<P>I will go on, and Argue thus. <HI>How is it possi∣ble, How is it possible,</HI> for such infinite <HI>Grace</HI> as fills the Heart of the Lord <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> ever to <HI>Reject</HI> the Sinner that <HI>comes</HI> unto Him? There came unto the Lord a <HI>Great Sinner,</HI> who made a

<HI>Trial</HI> of Him; and upon the <HI>Trial</HI> he Published this Report unto all the World; [1 Tim. 1.14.] <HI>The Grace of our Lord, Oh! tis Exceeding Abundant!</HI> A Man that has but a Little <HI>Grace,</HI> yet if there be, <HI>Any thing of CHRIST,</HI> in him, he will <HI>cast out None</HI> that come unto him for Help; he will treat <HI>all</HI> that come unto him, with Compassion, with Be∣nignity; he will Help them <HI>all,</HI> and Serve them <HI>all,</HI> and rejoyce to do them all the Good that e∣ver he can, All this <HI>Grace</HI> is but a very Little <HI>Picture,</HI> and Scarce <HI>That;</HI> of what is in our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI> It is unto <HI>His,</HI> not so much as a <HI>Drop</HI> unto the <HI>Ocean.</HI> It was of old said; Joel 2.13. <HI>Turn unto the Lord your God, for He is Gracious and Merciful and of Great Kindness.</HI> And we will now say, Come unto the Lord your Saviour, in whom it is that God becomes <HI>your God,</HI> for He is a <HI>Gracious</HI> and a <HI>Merciful</HI> Saviour; None can ut∣ter the <HI>Greatness</HI> of His <HI>Kindness!</HI></P>
<P>I will not yet cease to Argue; But Oh, Hear, what <HI>I have yet to speak, on the behalf</HI> of our dear∣est Saviour; <HI>I will ascribe</HI> a Peerless and Endless <HI>Goodness</HI> unto Him. Certainly He that <HI>never did</HI> Reject any Sinner that came unto Him, <HI>ne∣ver will</HI> Reject any Sinner that comes unto Him. Now <HI>this,</HI> this may be asserted concerning our Saviour. The <HI>Worst <HI>Sinners</HI></HI> in the World have come to Him; Did He ever <HI>cast out</HI> any of them? No, <HI>in no wise;</HI> not One of them all. We read of such as were Emphatically, <HI>Sinners,</HI> among them who came unto our Lord Jesus

Christ: And what became of them? What, but this, <HI>Their sins, which were many, were Forgiven them.</HI> Yea, The very <HI>Murderers</HI> of our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> Himself; the Wretches that <HI>with Wicked Hands</HI> Crucified Him and Murdered Him: The Sin of those <HI>Monsters,</HI> was the <HI>Greatest Sin,</HI> that e∣ver was Committed under the Cope of Heaven; The Earth trembled, the Rocks rent; the Sun turn'd black; the whole Frame of Nature was in a Convulsion at it. It may not without Hor∣ror be thought upon. And yet! Some of these very Murderers, Repented, and Repairing unto the Lord <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> obtained the <HI>Remission</HI> of all their Sin. There were horrid Sinners a∣mong the <HI>Corinthians;</HI> [1 Cor. 6.9, 10.] <HI>Fornica∣tors, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, Sodomites, Theeves, Coveteous, Drunkards, Revilers, Extortioners.</HI> What a <HI>Black List</HI> is here! Can the Bottom of <HI>Hell</HI> show a blacker! Ah! Holy JESUS! wouldest thou not <HI>cast out</HI> such as these, when they <HI>came</HI> unto thee? No; Read on. <HI>Such were some of you; BUT, Ye are Washed; BUT ye are San∣ctified; BUT ye are Justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, &amp; by the Spirit of our God.</HI> Oh! <HI>Grace!

as to <HI>Abound in Sin</HI> the more, on the pre∣tence that <HI>Grace may Abound.</HI> But have you not heard of such an amazing thing, as that? Rom. 5.20. <HI>Where Sin abounded, Grace did much more A∣bound.</HI> The <HI>Greater</HI> the <HI>Sinner</HI> that comes unto the Lord <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> the more will the Lord and His <HI>Grace,</HI> be <HI>Glorified</HI> in the <HI>Salvation</HI> of such a Sinner.

It must be a <HI>Great Salvation</HI> indeed▪ that shall help such a <HI>Sinner!</HI> It is pleaded; Ps. 25.11. <HI>For thy Names sake, O Lord, Pardon mine Iniquity; for it is Great.</HI> A <HI>Great Sinner</HI> may make this plea; <HI>Lord, It will be seen, that thy Name is Great, if so Great a Sinner as I, may be Saved from all my Iniquity!</HI> Men and Angels will upon the <HI>Salvation</HI> of such a <HI>Sinner</HI> conspire in Everlast∣ing Doxologies to the Glorious LORD. <Q>Oh! the <HI>Glory</HI> of that <HI>Grace,</HI> that would give a Glo∣rious CHRIST for <HI>such a Sinner!

Saved. And, <HI>Sinner,</HI> I am sure, thou mayest make this an Argument for thee, in thy Suppli∣cations to the Lord: <HI>Lord! Where can thy Glorious Grace find a fitter Object for its Precious and Eternal Triumphs, than in so great a Sinner!</HI></P>
<P>I know not how to dismiss this Lovely Theme. —And yet I will now add no more than this upon it. There cannot be <HI>Greater Sinners</HI> on <HI>Earth,</HI> than some <HI>were,</HI> who are <HI>now in Heaven,</HI> and Stand there, not only <HI>without Guilt,</HI> but also <HI>without Fault, before the Throme of God.</HI> Sinner, Be <HI>thy Sins</HI> never so horrible, never so horribly E∣normous; there are some now in <HI>Heaven,</HI> that once were Guilty of the very <HI>same Sins.</HI> A <HI>Bloody Robber</HI> had this from our Saviour, <HI>Thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</HI> And she that was <HI>Rahab the Harlot</HI> is <HI>there</HI> too! There are some in <HI>Para∣dise,</HI> who were once, <HI>The Chief of Sinners. Paul</HI> was caught up thither; <HI>Paul</HI> is now gone to stay there; And yet this <HI>Paul</HI> could say, <HI>I was a Blas∣phemer, and a Persecutor, and the Chief of Sinners.</HI> Oh! could we overhear the <HI>Fraises,</HI> that are the Melody of the <HI>Heavenly World!</HI> One who dy'd among us, after fifty years rolled away in Wick∣edness, out of which he was Effectually Recover∣ed a few Weeks before he dyed; when his Friends thought him gone, &amp; in a manner Dead, he Revived so far, as to Surprise them, with these Expressions; <HI>O my Friends, Heaven rings all over at this! They Wonder at this; A Great and an Old Sin∣ner coming to Heaven! O the Riches of Grace! O Glo∣rify
<PB N="62" REF="001256_0063_0FB18AAE1A8B0B40"/>
Free-Grace for ever more!</HI> And so he dy'd quite away. Were <HI>Heaven</HI> Open to us, we should o∣verhear Strange Acclamations! One that had been a very <HI>Oven</HI> of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> Crying out; <Q>Oh! Praises to that <HI>Saviour,</HI> that has rescued me from the <HI>Fiery Furnace,</HI> and Purified me, Sanctified me, brought me to the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints in Light!</HI></Q> Another that had been many a Time, as <HI>Drunk as a Beast,</HI> Crying out; <Q>Oh! Praises to that <HI>Saviour,</HI> that has fetch'd me from among the <HI>Bruits,</HI> and first infused the Holy Principles of <HI>Angels</HI> into me, and now placed me with His <HI>Angels,</HI> with the <HI>Princes of His People!</HI></Q> Another that had Sworn many a <HI>Profane Oath,</HI> and Spoke many a <HI>Lying Word,</HI> Crying out; <Q>Oh! Praises to that <HI>Saviour,</HI> who has kept out of <HI>Hell,</HI> a <HI>Tongue</HI> that had been <HI>Set on Fire of Hell;</HI> that will imploy one, who once belch'd out the Language of Friends, to Sing <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> with His <HI>Holy Ones!</HI></Q> Many, many more such <HI>strange Sights</HI> there are to be seen in Heaven. Say, O Encouraged Sinner, say, <HI>Why 'may not I make One of them!</HI></P>
<P>¶ And now, Upon the Astonishing Encou∣ragement, and, <HI>The Hope set before us,</HI> what shall we do? I had almost said, What <HI>can</HI> we do? But come to an agreeable Resolution?</P>
<P>Rosolve, O Perishing Souls, Resolve immedi∣ately, <HI>To come unto a Glorious</HI> CHRIST <HI>for His Great Salvation.</HI> Yea, tho' you see your selves to be very <HI>Great Sinners,</HI> and even the <HI>Chief of Sinners,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="001256_0064_0FB18AAF35A93690"/>
yet <HI>come</HI> unto Him, who <HI>came into the World,</HI> that He might <HI>Save Sinners,</HI> and even <HI>Such Sinners,</HI> from all their Sins.</P>
<P>It is a Thing that must Immediately be Resol∣ved upon. There is indeed no Room left for any <HI>Deliberation</HI> before you come unto a <HI>Resolution.</HI></P>
<P>HE that <HI>Commands</HI> you to <HI>come</HI> unto Him; Oh! who is HE? I am to tell you; HE is the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> HE is the <HI>King of Glory;</HI> HE is the Lord of <HI>Angels!</HI> It is HE, to whom all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth yield Obedience. <HI>Lord, All are thy Servants!</HI> Art thou Unresolved, O Sinner, Whether thou shalt yield Obedience to the <HI>Com∣mandment</HI> of such a LORD? Instead of thy Say∣ing, <HI>May I Dare to come unto Him?</HI> I will Say, <HI>How dost thou dare to do any other than come unto Him?</HI></P>
<P>It has always been beyond all Dispute, with all that are not with <HI>Madness in their Hearts going down unto the Dead;</HI> That, Psal. 73.28. <HI>It is Good for me to Draw near unto God.</HI> Certainly, It will be <HI>Good</HI> for you to <HI>come</HI> unto a Great SAVIOUR. But are you Unresolved, Whether you should come into a <HI>Friendship</HI> and a <HI>Fellowship</HI> with the Blessed GOD? Unresolved, Whether you should become the <HI>Sons and the Daughters of the Almighty?</HI> Unresolved, Whether you should Accept a claim to all the <HI>very Great and Precious Promises</HI> of the New Covenant? Oh! how can you continue so? Tis to continue Unresolved, Whether you had not best ly under the Fearful <HI>Curse</HI> of God, and have the Dreadful <HI>Wrath</HI> of God abiding on
<PB N="64" REF="001256_0065_0FB18AB0B9FE2548"/>
you? But is this possible? Can you continue Un∣resolved, Whether you shall Chuse your <HI>Portion with Unbelievers,</HI> and Weep and Wail in the <HI>Outer Darkness</HI> of an Eternal Banishment from the Bliss∣ful Mansions of the Righteous? Whether you shall Chuse to do the part of <HI>Devils,</HI> and have a part with <HI>Devils,</HI> and be held in the <HI>Chains</HI> of <HI>End∣less Darkness</HI> laid upon you? O unaccountable Indifferency! O inexcusable Stupidity!</P>
<P>Briefly; The Doom will pass upon you, from the Mouth of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, either, <HI>Come ye Blessed;</HI> or, <HI>Go, ye Cursed:</HI> This Doom will pass, according to your <HI>Coming</HI> to, or <HI>Keeping</HI> from, the Glorious LORD. Oh! No longer then con∣tinue Unresolved; But, as we read; Joh. 11.28, 29. <HI>She called Mary her Sister secretly, Saying, The Master calleth for thee: Assoon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto Him.</HI> I do here <HI>Openly</HI> declare unto you, <HI>The Saviour calleth you;</HI> Oh! That Now, <HI>Assoon</HI> as you <HI>hear that,</HI> you would <HI>arise quickly, and come unto Him!</HI></P>
<P>I will bring the Matter to an Issue. <HI>Try, Try,</HI> Whether you cannot with a Quickened Soul, Address your Great SAVIOUR. O Great Sin∣ners, Greatest, Vilest, Saddest of Sinners, Make the <HI>Trial. Take with you Words.</HI> You shall have <HI>Words</HI> put into your <HI>Mouths; Words</HI> which your most Gracious LORD has Himself Prepared for you; <HI>Words</HI> which if you do with your <HI>Hearts</HI> bring before the Lord, He will <HI>receive you graciously.</HI></P>
<P>Unto your Great SAVIOUR, Let your <HI>First
<PB N="65" REF="001256_0066_0FB18AB22A71F780"/>
Address</HI> be in those Words; Psal. 4.1. <HI>Hear me when I call, and be thou the God of my Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Let your <HI>Next Address</HI> be in those Words; Psal. 25.4. <HI>Shew me thy ways, O Lord, Teach me thy Pathes.</HI></P>
<P>Let your <HI>Third Address</HI> be in those Words; Psal. 119.133. <HI>Order my steps in thy Word, and let not any Iniquity have Dominion over me.</HI></P>
<P>It is for these Intents and Purposes, that you are to <HI>come</HI> unto your <HI>Saviour.</HI> And, Believe Him; He will <HI>cast out none that so come unto Him!</HI></P>
<P>I may not Conclude the Discourse, without Some Endeavours to deliver the Minds of my Hearers, from some <HI>Difficulties,</HI> which I find often Encumbring of them.</P>
<P>One thing that Supplies much <HI>Objection</HI> to them that are Invited by a Great SAVIOUR, to <HI>come</HI> unto Him, is This;</P>
<P><HI>I cannot come. I am not Able to Believe. Tis not in me to do it of my self. I cannot do it, until the Lord please to Enable me!</HI></P>
<P>That this <HI>Objection</HI> may not hold any People in their <HI>Impenitency,</HI> there are these things to be said upon it.</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Impotency</HI> of a Sinner to do it, must not be used as any <HI>Apology,</HI> for his <HI>Not coming</HI> to a Saviour. Where is the Seat of this <HI>Impotency?</HI> Tis in the <HI>Will;</HI> Tis in a Depraved <HI>Will.</HI> Tis <HI>Will∣ful,</HI> and therefore tis very <HI>Sinful.</HI> When a Sinner says, <HI>I cannot come to the Saviour, and own Him for my Saviour;</HI> the plain Truth is, <HI>He will not come.</HI> So tis charged upon Unbelievers; Joh. 5.40. <HI>Ye
<PB N="66" REF="001256_0067_0FB18AB3A0ABF3E0"/>
will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</HI> I Pray, What Excuse is it, for any other Crime, to Say, <HI>My Will stands that way!</HI> The most Vicious People in the World, have an Excuse for their not Re∣forming of their Vices, if the want of a <HI>Will</HI> to do it, may go for one. As little will this Excuse our <HI>Neglect of the Great Salvation;</HI> to plead, <HI>I have no Will to Look after it!</HI> When the Exhortations are made unto the <HI>Sinner,</HI> to <HI>Come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and receive <HI>the Unsearcheable Riches of Christ,</HI> Why does he not <HI>Come?</HI> What is the Reason? Sinner, the <HI>Reason!</HI> Speak out plainly; Say, <HI>I will not come unto the Lord: My Mind is no way disposed, my Heart is very much Averse, unto it!</HI> Oh! <HI>Scandalous Excuse</HI> for the worst <HI>Wickedness</HI> imaginable! To Say, <HI>I am Wicked, because I am not willing to be otherwise!</HI></P>
<P>I may Venture to Assert This; That never any man in the World, could Say, <HI>I am willing to come unto my Saviour, but He does not make me Able to come.</HI> The Sin∣ner does Really <HI>Begin</HI> to Believe on a Glorious CHRIST, if once he do Sincerely <HI>Desire</HI> to do it, or Desire that God would Enable Him to do it. <HI>Faith</HI> is actually <HI>Be∣gun,</HI> in the Soul, that is made Sincerely <HI>Willing</HI> to Be∣lieve. One Sincerely <HI>Willing</HI> to <HI>come</HI> unto the <HI>Saviour,</HI> had rather be gratified in this Point, than in any World∣ly Interest; He Prefers a Glorious CHRIST, above all the Things of this World; He Neglects no <HI>Means,</HI> he Omits no <HI>Cryes,</HI> that he may obtain the <HI>Grace</HI> to <HI>Lay Hold</HI> on Him, &amp; on <HI>Eternal Life</HI> in Him. Unbeliever, Thou art <HI>not, Willing</HI> to be any other than what thou <HI>art.</HI> And, This, This, will be thy <HI>Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. This <HI>Impotency</HI> must be confessd and Be∣wayled in our <HI>Coming</HI> to our Saviour; &amp; our Sensible
<PB N="67" REF="001256_0068_0FB18AB55CEEC8B8"/>
Confession of it, is a <HI>notable step</HI> of our <HI>Coming</HI> unto Him. It is not likely, that the Spirit of Grace will <HI>Enable</HI> us to <HI>Come</HI> unto our Saviour, till we feel and own that we are <HI>Ʋnable</HI> to <HI>Come.</HI> When we become <HI>Sensible</HI> that we are <HI>Ʋnable,</HI> and become <HI>Desirous</HI> to be <HI>Enabled,</HI> then we are indeed <HI>Beginning</HI> to come. When the <HI>Grace</HI> to Be∣lieve on a Glorious CHRIST, is to be wrought in a Soul, the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> will have the Glory of work∣ing it. See, O Sinner, That thou art <HI>Justly Damned,</HI> if thou dost not come to thy Saviour. <HI>See</HI> this; and <HI>Say</HI> it before the Lord. But at the same time also humbly say; <HI>Lord, I shall not come to my Saviour, if thy Sovereign Grace do not help me to come!</HI> 'Tis true, Such a Corrup∣tion there is upon the <HI>Will</HI> of <HI>Ʋnregenerate Man,</HI> that he <HI>will not come</HI> unto a Glorious CHRIST, but indeed have a greater Enmity to this, than to any one thing in all Religion; till there be an Efficacious and Superna∣tural Operation of God upon the <HI>Will,</HI> not only to lay <HI>Moral Suasions</HI> before it, but also to infuse a <HI>New Frame</HI> into it, and Effectually Incline it unto the <HI>Faith</HI> where∣to it is an Enemy. So far is the Sinner, from an <HI>Abi∣lity</HI> to change his own <HI>Will,</HI> and bring it unto the <HI>Faith</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, that whatever he does from his own meer <HI>Natural Ability,</HI> cannot oblige the God of Heaven, to make a Saving Change upon it. Let us keep to that famous <HI>Tenth Article</HI> of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> <Q>The Condition of man is such, after the Fall, that he cannot turn, nor prepare himself by his own Natural Strength, to Faith and Calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do Good Works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God preventing us, that we may have a Good Will, and working with us, when we have that Good Will.</Q></P>
<P>But then, how is this <HI>Good Confession</HI> to be prosecu∣ted? Not now to <HI>Ly down like a Stag in a Net,</HI> with des∣pair
<PB N="68" REF="001256_0069_0FB18AB711E8F600"/>
ever to escape the <HI>Fury of the Lord.</HI> No; but from thy <HI>Sinful Grave,</HI> O Sinner, send up thy Sighs un∣to the Lord. Tho' Lying in the <HI>Belly of Hell,</HI> yet give a <HI>Look</HI> towards the <HI>Holy Temple.</HI> Make that Acknow∣ledgment; Joh. 6.44. <HI>No man can come, except the Father Draw him.</HI> But then beg it of the <HI>Father; Oh! Draw me, Draw me to my Saviour!</HI> Acknowledge that; Eph. 2.8. <HI>Faith, is not of your selves, 'tis the Gift of God.</HI> But, then, beg it of God; <HI>Oh! Give me, Give me, a true Faith in my Saviour!</HI> Acknowledge that; Phil 2.13. <HI>It is God, who worketh in you, both to Will and to Do, of His Good pleasure</HI> But then, beg it of God; <HI>Oh! Work in me the Will, and help me to do this thing, to Come unto my Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>After this <HI>praeface</HI> unto it, <HI>Now</HI> come! Now see whe∣ther thou canst not, with a <HI>New Life</HI> infused into thee from Heaven, say, <HI>Lord! I come unto thee!</HI></P>
<P>Another thing, that causes much <HI>Confusion,</HI> to them that are invited by a Great SAVIOUR, to <HI>Come</HI> unto Him, is This.</P>
<P><Q>Does it not Look like Double Dealing? What Re∣ality can there be, in the Lords bidding all men to come unto Him, when He knows He will not help them all to do it. If the Lord has not Really purpo∣sed, that He will Enable any but His Elect Effectu∣ally to come unto Him, what Sincerity can there be in His calling them to come?</Q></P>
<P>Sinner, Let none of these <HI>Cavils</HI> retard thy <HI>Coming</HI> to thy <HI>Saviour.</HI> It's a meer piece of <HI>Confusion</HI> to insist upon them. 'Tis Enough, That He calls <HI>Thee</HI> to <HI>Come,</HI> and He will <HI>not cost thee out,</HI> if thou <HI>Come.</HI> Do but <HI>Come,</HI> and thou shalt find He has been most <HI>Sin∣cere</HI> in His <HI>Call</HI> unto thee.</P>
<P>'Tis true; The Lord knows, that <HI>Reprobates</HI> will not <HI>Come</HI> unto Him; And, He knows, that He will
<PB N="69" REF="001256_0070_0FB18AB871E84E60"/>
not give them a <HI>Will</HI> to <HI>Come.</HI> Yet He Delude no man, when He says to <HI>all</HI> men, <HI>Him that comes unto <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Where is the <HI>Reprobate,</HI> who can say, <HI>That the Lord has dealt falsely with him?</HI> It must be a man, who <HI>knows</HI> himself to be a <HI>Reprobate.</HI> This <HI>no man</HI> Living does. O man, As 'tis <HI>thy Duty</HI> to come unto thy <HI>Saviour,</HI> so 'tis <HI>thy Duty</HI> to reckon it <HI>probable,</HI> that thou art one whom the Lord intends to <HI>bring</HI> unto <HI>thy Saviour.</HI> To doom thy self a <HI>Reprobate,</HI> would be a Criminal Impiety: <HI>Oh! Do it not!</HI></P>
<P>Had the <HI>Call</HI> to <HI>come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> been directed unto the <HI>Elect,</HI> exclusive of the <HI>Reprobate,</HI> or been any other than unto <HI>All the Children of man</HI> in general, the <HI>Ends</HI> of the <HI>Call</HI> had utterly been defeated. On the one side; No man would have <HI>Obey'd</HI> the <HI>Call;</HI> For no man can know himself to be one of the <HI>Elect,</HI> until he has <HI>Obey'd</HI> the <HI>Call.</HI> Every Individual man, would have been at a Loss; whether he <HI>might</HI> have <HI>come</HI> un∣to the <HI>Saviour,</HI> or no. On the other side; The <HI>Repro∣bate</HI> now Enjoy many <HI>Priviledges,</HI> many <HI>Advantages</HI> by the <HI>Call.</HI> It Restrains them from very much <HI>Disorder:</HI> It proves an Instrument that furnishes them with ma∣ny <HI>Ornaments.</HI> And, It prevents their passing away their Time, in such a doleful <HI>Desperation,</HI> as would o∣therwise make very <HI>Devils</HI> of them.</P>
<P><HI>Reprobation</HI> is not the Immediate <HI>Cause,</HI> why the <HI>Re∣probate</HI> will not <HI>Come</HI> unto the <HI>Saviour.</HI> No; Their own Sinful, Corrupt, Wicked <HI>Nature</HI> is the <HI>Cause.</HI> If God should Lay <HI>Chains</HI> upon a <HI>Sinner,</HI> against his <HI>Will,</HI> and then Bid him to <HI>Come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> this indeed would look like a <HI>Mockery.</HI> But the <HI>Cause</HI> why a <HI>Sin∣ner</HI> does not <HI>Come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> is not because God will not <HI>Enable</HI> him; 'Tis because he has <HI>Disabled</HI> himself; he has cast himself into the <HI>Snares</HI> of Death, and keeps the <HI>Chains</HI> of Hell upon his own Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="001256_0071_0FB18AB9A4FD5858"/>The <HI>Grace</HI> of God that should Restore the Depraved <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <HI>Sinner,</HI> and Quicken him to come unto a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Convey'd in the <HI>Means of Grace.</HI> The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> sight those means, and use them not. God makes a Tender of His <HI>Grace.</HI> They will not so much as <HI>Accept</HI> the Tender; They will not so much as <HI>Request</HI> His Help to <HI>Accept</HI> it; They will not,—they ne∣ver <HI>Do,</HI> what they <HI>can,</HI> towards the <HI>Renovation</HI> of their <HI>Will;</HI> that which, tho' God has not bound Himself by promise, to <HI>Renew</HI> them, upon their doing of it, yet their doing of it, would render it <HI>most highly probable,</HI> that He would with <HI>Saving Influences</HI> look upon them. Such is the <HI>Antipathy</HI> of the Sinner, to Believing on a Glorious CHRIST, that if he had <HI>more strength,</HI> he would still <HI>Do just as he does.</HI> And where lies the <HI>Im∣propriety</HI> of it, if the Great GOD, will <HI>many ways Glori∣fy Himself,</HI> by calling upon such a <HI>Sinner,</HI> to <HI>come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour?</HI> Where Lies the <HI>Dissimulation,</HI> (as 'tis <HI>Blas∣phemed,</HI>) if the Great GOD now declare in the Hear∣ing of such a Sinner, That for men to <HI>Come</HI> unto a <HI>Saviour,</HI> is a thing that will be <HI>Approved</HI> by Him?</P>
<P>In fine; The <HI>Elect</HI> and the <HI>Reprobate</HI> they <HI>Live toge∣ther</HI> in this World. The <HI>Call</HI> of the Gospel must come to <HI>Both together.</HI> 'Tis for the same Reason, that when the <HI>Corn</HI> and the <HI>Stones</HI> in the same Field, <HI>Ly together,</HI> the <HI>Rain</HI> must fall upon <HI>Both together.</HI> God will see that the <HI>Call</HI> stall be <HI>Efficacious</HI> to the <HI>Elect;</HI> and there shall be enough to leave the <HI>Reprobate</HI> Inexcusable.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>O Sinner, Talk no more exceeding vainly, nor let any more of this Cavilling proceed out of thy mouth.</HI> Try, Strive, Beg, that thou mayst <HI>Come</HI> unto thy <HI>Saviour; Come</HI> to Him, as well as thou <HI>canst.</HI> It may be, that <HI>He</HI> will help thee to <HI>Come.</HI> Then thy <HI>Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
