<HEAD>The History of a LONG WAR, Briefly Recited &amp; Improved.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">At BOSTON, 30. d. VII. m. 1714.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not so much for a Close Discourse upon the TEXT, as for a <HI>Vindication</HI> of, and an <HI>In∣troduction</HI> to, an UNCOMMON ACTION, Which I have thought I may have a Sufficient Commission this Day to Proceed upon; that I shall now be∣gin my Discourse, with reading to you, what is Written, in</P>
<Q><BIBL>PSAL. LXVIII. 33.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Lo, He doth send forth His Voice, and that a Mighty Voice.</HI></P></Q>
<P>TIS not my Purpose to make any Re∣marks on the <HI>Psalm,</HI> which affords this Text unto us, and which is as <HI>Jerous</HI> Long Since Observed, <HI>Refertus Mysterijs,</HI> Full of <HI>Mysteries;</HI> I may add, — and Full of <HI>Prophecies.</HI></P>
<P>Every One that hears it Read, will Presently form this <HI>Doctrine</HI> upon it,</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001688_0003_0FB52A8356A02CE0"/>
<HI>There is a Voice of</HI> GOD <HI>unto the Children of Men; Yea, a</HI> MIGHTY VOICE: <HI>And therefore a Voice Mightily to be hearken'd to.</HI></P>
<P>THE Entertainment, I Suppose, would not have been Unprofitable, if I should have Enquired, <HI>What is the Voice of GOD, and what is it that the Mighty Voice of our GOD Speaks unto us?</HI> You are all aware, That in the <HI>Gospel</HI> which is the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, we have the <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of God, Speaking to us, in the Plainnest Manner that can be. Our JESUS who <HI>Spake as never Man Spake,</HI> did never <HI>Speak,</HI> in the Dayes of His Flesh among us, but, <HI>GOD Uttered His Voice,</HI> in the most familiar Way that can be imagined. But there is also the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD in all the Oracles of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> GOD inspired the Writers of these Oracles, and there is a <HI>Mighty Voice of GOD</HI> in the Inspiration. Where the <HI>Gospel</HI> comes, <HI>The Great Trumpet is blown,</HI> and there is a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of GOD, in the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of that <HI>Jubilee.</HI> Sirs, It would be Well, if you would be Prevailed upon, When you <HI>Take up</HI> the <HI>Bible,</HI> and Open it, then to think, <HI>The Mighty Voice of GOD is now Speaking to me;</HI> And when <HI>Qualified Preachers</HI> Open the <HI>Bible</HI> unto you, then again to think, <HI>The Mighty Voice of GOD, is what I must now give ear∣nest Heed unto.</HI> Methinks, You should be also aware, That in the Dictates of our <HI>Conscience</HI> we have the <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of GOD unto us. The <HI>Principle</HI> in Man, which acts in a Way of <HI>Judging</HI> on him, as <HI>Under the Judgment of GOD;</HI> tho' the Dictates of that <HI>Prin∣ciple,</HI> are a Sort of <HI>Whispers,</HI> yet there are also <HI>Thun∣ders</HI> in them: <HI>It cryes with a Loud Voice, as when a Lion roars!</HI> Oh! that Men were more fearful of
<PB N="3" REF="001688_0004_0FB52A84D5D395E0"/><HI>Rebelling against the Light,</HI> and against the <HI>Voice</HI> of a <HI>Principle,</HI> which, O rash Man, if thou put continual Sleights upon, will One Day <HI>Tear thee to Pieces, and there shall be none to deliver thee.</HI> Yea, I will say unto you, <HI>Sound Reason</HI> is always the <HI>Voice of GOD.</HI> When ever any Maxim, or Demand of <HI>Reason</HI> is Of∣fered unto us, We have GOD Speaking unto us. My Brethren, If you will <HI>Shew your selves Men,</HI> and <HI>Hearken to Reason,</HI> You may fill your Lives with <HI>Acts of Obedience</HI> unto GOD. Whatever you see to be <HI>Reason,</HI> Conform to it, from this Consideration, <HI>Tis what GOD Calls me to!</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, You must be as much aware of this; That there is a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of GOD, in all the <HI>Works</HI> of His Hands. All His Dispensations are <HI>Speaking Dispensations.</HI> The Works of <HI>Creation;</HI> There <HI>is no Speech nor Language, Where their Voice is not heard.</HI> All the <HI>Creatures</HI> of GOD are so many <HI>Teachers</HI> to us. <HI>Ask them now, and they shall teach thee;</HI> Yea, the <HI>Mutest</HI> of them <HI>shall declare unto thee.</HI> The Works of <HI>Providence</HI> too; <HI>Stand still, and Consider these Wondrous Works of God;</HI> That is, To <HI>Hear</HI> what they <HI>Speak</HI> un∣to us. The <HI>General Providence</HI> of GOD, which <HI>Pre∣serves</HI> and <HI>Governs</HI> the World, has a <HI>Voice</HI> to all the World; The <HI>Wheels</HI> of it make a <HI>Noise</HI> in their Mo∣tions. But so too has the <HI>Special Providence.</HI> There is a <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD unto us, in what we see befalling of <HI>Others.</HI> The <HI>Rewarding</HI> of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> and the <HI>Punishing</HI> of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> has alwayes a <HI>Voice</HI> in it, unto all the Spectators of it. But — much more in what we feel befalling <HI>Our selves.</HI> Do we meet with <HI>Agreeable</HI> Things? <HI>I Speak unto thee in thy Prosperity, saith the Lord.</HI> — Oh! but what follows? — Do we meet with <HI>Deplorable</HI> Things? Now, <HI>Hear
<PB N="4" REF="001688_0005_0FB52A8658CF4D98"/>the Rod; the Voice of the Lord Cryes unto the Sufferer.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Sum</HI> of the <HI>Voice,</HI> even the <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> You cannot but be aware, and apprised of it. It is that of the <HI>Angel</HI> with the <HI>Everlasting Gospel, Saying with a Loud Voice, Fear GOD, and give Glory to HIM.</HI> 'Tis,
<Q>O <HI>Acknowledge</HI> the Glorious GOD in all Your Wayes; Make it the <HI>Chief End</HI> of your Lives, to Render and Procure, continual Acknow∣ledgments of His <HI>Glories.</HI> Place your Blessedness, in the Enjoyment of Him. Embrace the Lovely JE∣SUS in all His Offices, as the <HI>Only Saviour,</HI> to bring you unto that Blessedness. Be afraid of all <HI>Sin</HI> against the Holy Lord. Be Weaned from a <HI>World,</HI> wherein Satisfaction is to be despaired of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the <HI>Wiser</HI> and the <HI>Better</HI> for all that befalls you; and let GOD have <HI>Revenues</HI> to His Kingdom, out of all that He does for you, or on you. Walk with GOD, and be <HI>Holy in all manner of Conversation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS the <HI>Voice.</HI> No Doubt, I might have gone on Profitably, to have told you, <HI>How and Why the Mighty Voice of GOD is Mightily to be hearkened to?</HI> To have told you, That to Study the Mind of God in His <HI>Voice,</HI> and to <HI>be,</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> what is therein called for, is to Hearken to it. And then, to have told you, that since 'tis the <HI>Mighty Voice of GOD,</HI> there need no other <HI>Argument</HI> for its being <HI>Mightily Hearken'd to.</HI></P>
<P>— BUT it is another Entertainment, That I have under the Impressions of GOD, and with His Assistences, Prepared for you.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001688_0006_0FB52A88969BD780"/>
¶ THE <HI>Design</HI> which I Propose this Day to Prosecute, is, That the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD, even His <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the <HI>Later Dispensations</HI> of His Providence towards this Land, may be Re∣garded, be Understood, be Complied withal.</P>
<P>WHEN the former <HI>Long War,</HI> which our Treache∣rous and Barbarous <HI>Enemies</HI> made upon us, was fi∣nished, there was an <HI>Essay</HI> to make some Improve∣ment of the <HI>Observable Things</HI> that had occurred in it: An <HI>Essay,</HI> which God and His People approved of.</P>
<P>ANOTHER <HI>Long War</HI> is now finished; A <HI>New Peace</HI> hath been struck up, in our Borders: And it is Time to Consider the <HI>Voice</HI> of our God unto us, in the <HI>Observable Things</HI> that have therein Passed over us. For, <HI>O my Dear People,</HI> While thy God has been <HI>Striking</HI> of thee, He has been also <HI>Speaking</HI> to thee; And it is of the Last Consequence, that His <HI>Voice</HI> be Wisely hearkened to; A Total Inadvertency to the <HI>Voice,</HI> will have a Consequence which we may justly tremble at; — If to be <HI>Punished yet Ten times for our Iniquities,</HI> or with more than <HI>Ten Years</HI> of Con∣fusions repeared upon us, be a thing to be trembled at.</P>
<P>IT is an <HI>Holy Undertaking;</HI> may it be a very <HI>Useful</HI> One!</P>
<P>FROM such an <HI>Holy Undertaking,</HI> we must not be discouraged, by the Derision of a few Foolish, and Flashy, and Prophane Creatures, (no more to be valued than the Dirt of a <HI>Street</HI>) who Scoff at all <HI>Sermons</HI> of an <HI>Historical Importance;</HI> that is to say. At such <HI>Sermons</HI> as the Prophets of God have all over the Bible Exemplified unto us; Creatures below the
<PB N="6" REF="001688_0007_0FB52A8AEAD5E970"/>Notice of One, who would <HI>Go Well,</HI> and in Holy and <HI>Comely Going</HI> would never <HI>turn away for any.</HI> No, Sirs; Were One of the bright Angels detach'd and dispatch'd from the <HI>Multitude of the Heavenly Host</HI> unto us, most certainly he would most cheerfully take up a <HI>Trumpet</HI> of God, and embrace the Office and the Honour of Sounding the <HI>Trumpet,</HI> that should render the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious LORD very Plain unto His People, and awaken them to Entertain that <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> with a due Attention and Obedience.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, Having this Opportunity, of Seeing the <HI>Elders</HI> and the <HI>Judges</HI> of our <HI>Israel,</HI> here assembled, I call upon you, <HI>Stand Still, that I may Reason with you before the Lord,</HI> Concerning the <HI>Righteous Acts</HI> which He hath done among you, and His <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> in those <HI>Acts,</HI> which He Expects you to take a <HI>Reasonable</HI> and a <HI>Religious</HI> Notice of.</P>
<P>GOD forbid, That a People of our <HI>Profession</HI> and <HI>Original,</HI> should be so abandoned by the <HI>Spirit of Piety,</HI> as to be Insensible, that there is a <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD unto us, even a <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the Things which He has dispensed unto us, during our <HI>Long War,</HI> with the <HI>Eastern Salvages,</HI> and the bloody <HI>Papists</HI> that have inspired them and abetted them. Verily, Such an Insensibility would but bring us within the reach of that flaming Thunderbolt; Psal. XXVIII. 5. <HI>Because they regard not the Works of the Lord, nor the Operation of His Hands, He shall destroy them, and not build them up.</HI> I again say, <HI>God forbid!</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, the <HI>First</HI> Thing, Whereto your At∣tention is demanded, is; That the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glo∣rious GOD, even His <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the <HI>Long War</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001688_0008_0FB52A8C55CE4A68"/>that has been Wasting of us, is what <HI>All People,</HI> have been addressed with; what <HI>All Persons</HI> have been concerned in. The History of this <HI>Duodecennium Luctu∣osum,</HI> would consist either of too <HI>Minute Actions,</HI> or be sometimes rather an <HI>History of Inaction,</HI> and some∣times, especially where the chief Actors were <HI>Strangers</HI> to us, the <HI>Truth of the Matter</HI> cannot well be come at, if it were to be retail'd in all its Particularities. You shall have it all in a <HI>Summary Way,</HI> and in Ex∣pressive Terms provided as long ago, as, 2 Chron. XV. 5, 6. <HI>In those times, there was no Peace, to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great Vexations were upon all the Inhabitants of the Countries; For God did Vex them with all Adversity.</HI> And certainly, the <HI>Voice</HI> of God has been Extended unto <HI>All the Inhabi∣tants;</HI> who have <HI>All</HI> been Sharers in the <HI>Great Vexa∣tions</HI> of this Long <HI>Adversity.</HI> Truely, We have <HI>All</HI> been <HI>Sufferers.</HI> How many have Suffered in their <HI>Persons?</HI> Not a few, have <HI>Endured Hardships as Good Souldiers</HI> in the Publick Service. How many have Suffered, in what has befallen the <HI>Relatives</HI> for which they have had a Tenderness? The frequent <HI>Pressea</HI> have often, often, filled our Houses with Anguish. The <HI>Heavy Taxes</HI> have been such, that every One has felt the <HI>Burden:</HI> Perhaps, those few that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d None,</HI> did feel as much as any, of the <HI>Burden.</HI> And then, Tis to be hoped, no <HI>Man</HI> could be so <HI>Labu∣mane,</HI> but that he had a <HI>Sympathy</HI> with <HI>Other Sufferers;</HI> The Advice of all <HI>Evil Occurrents</HI> afflicted him. Surely, we have <HI>All</HI> been <HI>Sinners</HI> too! And this, no doubt, <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>Voice</HI> of our Glorious GOD unto us <HI>All. Hear this All ye People, Every One of you! Let every One of you All now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earch and Try his Wayes, and turn unto the Lord.</HI> Sirs, We have ALL of us by our Various Miscarriages Contributed unto
<PB N="8" REF="001688_0009_0FB52A8DD5BF3320"/>the <HI>Controversy,</HI> which a Just GOD has been mana∣ging with us, in this Long Day of our <HI>Calamity.</HI> It was Once the Complaint of Heaven; Jer. VIII. 6. <HI>I hearkened and heard, but they Spake not aright; No Men repented him of his Wickedness, Saying, What have I done?</HI> Oh! May it not be heard over us! The <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of our God unto us, is; <HI>Let every Man Enquire, What Errors of his Own have thrown Oyl into the Flame of that Anger that has been such a Devouring Fire upon you.</HI> And, <HI>Let every Man Enquire, What he shall do, that tho' God has been Angry, His Anger may be turned away, and His People may be Comforted.</HI></P>
<P>BESURE, We are deaf to <HI>Thunder,</HI> if we do not hear this <HI>Voice</HI> of our God unto us all, in what we have all met withal: <HI>Oh! Take off your Hearts from a World, which I have so many wayes Embittered unto you all. Prefer, Pursue, Expect a Portion in a better World.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if the <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of God may be appre∣hended as most Cogently, and most Pungently di∣rected unto them that have been the <HI>Greatest Sufferers,</HI> 'tis to be hoped our dear Brethren in the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> will be most Suitably Affected with it. O our Brethren, Who are Posted in the <HI>Valley of Achor;</HI> who have Gotten and Eaten every Grain of your Bread, with the <HI>Peril of your Lives</HI> from the <HI>Sword of the Wilderness;</HI> who have had your <HI>Lives</HI> alwayes as it <HI>were in your Hands,</HI> ready to be offered up, and been Shut up in very <HI>Uneasy</HI> Circumstances: To you there is this <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of God your Sa∣viour; <HI>Heaven requires it of you, to be the best Peo∣ple upon Earth!</HI> O Examine whether you are so; and Examine how you shall Order your <HI>Behaviours,</HI> and your <HI>Families,</HI> that you may be so.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001688_0010_0FB52A9015B63A40"/>
OUR <HI>Mariners</HI> and our <HI>Fishermen,</HI> distinguished with so many <HI>Destructions</HI> upon them, ought certain∣ly to consider their Peculiar Obligations to have their Ears Listening to the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD. <HI>He that hath Ears to hear, Let him hear, What GOD now Speaks unto him.</HI></P>
<P>I will go on, and invite you to Consider, in the <HI>Second</HI> Place, Whether you cannot hear a <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD, even a <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the <HI>Per∣fidy</HI> of the Enemy; Yea, and in the Remarkable <HI>Revenges,</HI> the Astonishing <HI>Revenges,</HI> of the HOLY ONE upon that <HI>Perfidy.</HI> It is well known, that on the Twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> Twelve Years ago, the Sa∣gamores of the East, with their Dependents, made their Submissions to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and Re∣new'd their Promises of Living in all Good Peace with the <HI>English</HI> Subjects thereof, and there were Two Pillars of Stone Erected, with the Hierogly∣phick Name of, <HI>The Two Brothers,</HI> for the Perpetual Memory of the Thing. And yet, it is now known, That at that very Time, the <HI>Perfidious Intentions</HI> of those Monsters were such, that it was a most Won∣derful Appearance of the Divine Providence, which Preserved His Excellency our Governour, and the Principal Gentlemen of his Two Provinces, then attending upon him, from an <HI>Hellish Contrivance</HI> of theirs to have Siezed on their Persons: We are this Day blessing our GOD, with them, as well as for them, in a Doxology of Antiquity; <HI>Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a Prey to their Teeth!</HI> But, alas, We can tell who did quickly become the <HI>Prey</HI> to these <HI>Dragons in the Wilderness</HI> Prepare to <HI>hear</HI> a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> which our Poor Neigh∣bours did not prepare to <HI>feel.</HI> On the Tenth of
<PB N="10" REF="001688_0011_0FB52A9195BE15F8"/>the following <HI>August,</HI> these Wretches under the <HI>Gal∣lick</HI> and <HI>Satanick</HI> Instigation, <HI>Put forth their Hands against such as were at Peace with them, and broke their Covenant.</HI> While our People were in the Pro∣found <HI>Sleep,</HI> of a <HI>Peace</HI> just now established, with all the Solemnity imaginable, never <HI>Dreaming</HI> that it could be Possible for any thing in the Shape of <HI>Men,</HI> — to do what was going to be done;— So much was <HI>France</HI> forgotten! — Behold, Now these Treacherous <HI>Infidels,</HI> [Their being <HI>French Christians,</HI> will not hinder me from calling them so!] I say, these <HI>Infidels</HI> went up against the <HI>Land of Un∣walled Villages.</HI> In Scattered Parcels, they fell, at Once on Seven Villages; They Murdered and Cap∣tived, More than <HI>One Hundred and Seventy</HI> of our People. And on some of them, especially some Wo∣men with Child, they Perpetrated Barbarities, which humane Ears can do no other than tingle at. God Miraculously Saved many Exposed Places, from these first Efforts of <HI>Indian</HI> Fury!</P>
<P>BUT, O NEW-ENGLAND, Wilt thou hear the <HI>Voice</HI> of thy Glorious GOD unto thee, in this dis∣mal Tragedy? His <HI>Voice,</HI> even His <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> unto thee, is; <HI>Thou hast Sinned against my Covenant. A Sword is thus brought upon thee to avenge the Quar∣rel of my Covenant. The Violations of my Covenant in the Midst of thee must be Repented of!</HI></P>
<P>I will take this Occasion to bear yet a more Par∣ticular Testimony. <HI>New-England</HI> hears ill among Strangers, for the Crime of, <HI>Promise-breaking.</HI> The <HI>Promises</HI> of many Men, they say, are Little to be relied upon. It is reported, that many Pretenders to Religion, are not, <HI>Men of their Word.</HI> I know not
<PB N="11" REF="001688_0012_0FB52A9315B743E0"/>what their Pretences are; Be they what they will, the Men must not be own'd for the <HI>True Citizens of Zion.</HI> But, Lo, in the Punishment the Country undergoes, from the most Infamous <HI>Promise-breakers,</HI> there is this <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of God unto us, <HI>O my People, Promise-breakers must not be found among you: Be Children that will not Ly; So I will be your Sa∣viour.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, but what Effect have the <HI>Salvages</HI> found of their <HI>Persidy?</HI> A <HI>Vengeance</HI> of God has follow'd them; A <HI>Vengeance,</HI> that must be a <HI>Stay,</HI> and a <HI>Warning</HI> to all the World.</P>
<P>HOW Many of them, have been Sacrificed by <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sword,</HI> it is not Easy for us to say. They never <HI>Assault,</HI> but when they can <HI>Surprize.</HI> They have Quick Retreats to <HI>Thickets</HI> and <HI>Mountains</HI> that are to us inaccessible; The <HI>Europeans,</HI> who Wonder that all these Colonies don't Presently Swallow them up, have no <HI>Idea</HI> of them. When also any of them fall in <HI>Battel,</HI> the Survivers use more than ordinary Care to <HI>Cover</HI> them. However, I have been able to reckon many more than an <HI>Hundred</HI> of these Cursed Salvages, which have been known to be Kill'd by <HI>Our Hands.</HI> But, <HI>Thy Hand.</HI> O Lord, <HI>has found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thine Enemies; Thy Right Hand has found out those that hate thee!</HI> God has Plagued them with <HI>Famin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>Sioknest,</HI> and many <HI>Wasting</HI> Miseries 'Tis affirm'd. They are so reduced, that they cannot make <HI>Half</HI> the Number, which they could when the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> began. God has distress'd them Wonderfully! And so He will Some who are greater than <HI>they,</HI> and who have infused their Maxims into <HI>them.</HI> There is that <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> from the GOD of TRUTH to <HI>Those,</HI> in what has befallen <HI>These.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="001688_0013_0FB52A9496EA7C50"/>
AND yet, I Wish, the <HI>Wounded Chaldeans,</HI> may not rise up Once more to inflict <HI>Grievous Wounds</HI> upon <HI>Us.</HI> To Prevent more Desolations, I would with all <HI>Humility,</HI> but with all <HI>Importunity,</HI> most Vehement∣ly, and with most Pressing Instances, beseech the Government, That all due Methods may be taken, for the Upholding of <HI>Religion</HI> in the Plantations of the <HI>East,</HI> as they shall be going on. Sirs, What has been done more than twice to break up our <HI>Eastern</HI> Plantations, has in it this <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glo∣rious GOD; Yea, 'tis His <HI>Mighty Voice. Oh! Let not People be any more so Foolish, as to think of taking Root, in Ungospellized Settlements; Lest I Once more do Suddenly Curse their Habitations.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, <HI>Thirdly;</HI> We must be aware of this; That none of the <HI>Particular Depredations,</HI> which the Enemy has in this <HI>Long War</HI> made upon us, have been without a <HI>Voice</HI> from the Glorious GOD unto us in them: Yea, a <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> which ought to be <HI>heard attentively,</HI> as the <HI>Sound going out from His Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>HE that would Write the History of this <HI>War,</HI> must put upon it the Title that <HI>Orosius</HI> put upon his History, <HI>De Miseria homin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI></P>
<P>AN Exact and Punctual Account of the several <HI>Depredations,</HI> with which the <HI>Wild-beasts of the Desert</HI> have broke in upon us, is not necessary to be Ex∣hibited. Nor would it often afford more <HI>Material</HI> Passages, than those <HI>Insipid</HI> Ones, which the Funeral Orations on the Professors in the Universities are commonly Stuffed withal. But allow me to throw the <HI>Murdered</HI> and the <HI>Captived</HI> into the same List,
<PB N="13" REF="001688_0014_0FB52A96D632E068"/>as there is <HI>too much cause</HI> to do, and I find my self able to bring in a List of near <HI>Seven Hundred</HI> Persons, whom our Offended GOD has delivered up into the dreadful Hands of the Salvages. No doubt there have been more! The Boast made by One bloody Son of <HI>Cain</HI> among them has been generally heard of! — <HI>Animus meminisse ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et!</HI></P>
<P>OFTENTIMES what the <HI>Salvages</HI> have done, has been upon one, or two, or theirs, at a time; done by a <HI>Skulking</HI> and <HI>Woiviso</HI> Adversary.</P>
<P>BUT Sometimes a Town has undergone a greater Effusion of Blood. <HI>Haverhil</HI> at once Loses above Thirty of it's Inhabitants; And, Poor <HI>Deerfield!</HI>— Never to be forgotten <HI>Deerfield!</HI> — An Hundred, and Perhaps twice Thirty more.</P>
<P>HOW many <HI>Deaths</HI> have been Contracted and Hastened, by the <HI>Fatigues</HI> of Attempts against the Enemy, — there can be no Account.</P>
<P>ADD unto these, the Numberless <HI>Deaths,</HI> accelera∣ted upon ours in their <HI>Engagements</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> at Sea, or by their <HI>Confinements</HI> among them: — Here our Bleeding Land would Cry out, <HI>Oh! That my Grief were thoroughly Weigh'd! Now it would be heavy like the Sand o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, What I am now to note, is, There has been a <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD, in every One of these Disasters.</P>
<P>I have reckoned up, in this <HI>War,</HI> near an <HI>Hundred Times,</HI> that <HI>Evil Tidings</HI> have been brought in unto
<PB N="14" REF="001688_0015_0FB52A9915AECFD0"/>us, of <HI>Mischiefs</HI> done to our Brethren and our Chil∣dren, on the Land. <HI>Mischief upon Mischief!</HI> — Be∣sides those which have come to us, on the Other Element. Among which, that on <HI>Fishery</HI> at one time amounting to Ten Thousand Pounds Damage, will not be forgotten! Sirs, There has been a <HI>Voice</HI> from the Glorious GOD Renew'd unto us, in every Stroke of such <HI>Evil Tidings. A Voice from the East, a Voice from the West, a Voice from the North,</HI> and a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> coming over the <HI>Mighty Waters</HI> too; <HI>A Voice from the Lord, rendring</HI> His Righteous Recompences to us, by our <HI>Enemies.</HI> His terrible <HI>Voice</HI> in all these things has been, <HI>I am displeased with you; Oh! Take up due Sentiments of my awful Displeasure at you!</HI></P>
<P>IN the midst of these Calamitous Things, could we see BOSTON in <HI>Flames;</HI> the very Place where I am now Standing, Perish in the Flames; the Glare whereof reached more than hundred Miles off; and not hear the <HI>Voice</HI> of a Provoked GOD, in these <HI>Fiery Rebukes?</HI> Yea, our GOD Spoke to us with His <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> from the Midst of the <HI>Fire,</HI> as from a∣nother Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> His <HI>Voice</HI> unto us was, <HI>O Fear Me, and Receive Instruction, that so no more of your Dwel∣lings may be cut off!</HI></P>
<P>IN a Long <HI>Drought</HI> also this Year, the <HI>Lord God has been calling to comend by Fire</HI> with us. And from the <HI>Heavens</HI> become like <HI>Brass</HI> over us, there has been a <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD reaching to the <HI>Earth</HI> become like <HI>Iron</HI> under us; <HI>O Land not Rain'd upon, Humble thy self in this Day of Indignation!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, as <HI>All Sorts</HI> have come under the <HI>Deadly Strokes</HI> of this Time, so the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD unto Each
<PB N="15" REF="001688_0016_0FB52A9A95C89578"/>of them should be more Particularly considered by all the Survivors. The <HI>Deadly Strokes</HI> have been <HI>Decimations</HI> used by a Sovereign GOD, upon <HI>Rebel∣lious Legious;</HI> and all we that are Spared, should hear what His Blowes upon <HI>Some,</HI> do Speak unto us <HI>All.</HI> By <HI>Aged</HI> Ones, that have had their <HI>Gray Hairs</HI> dy'd in their Blood, GOD Speaks to <HI>Old Men, Oh! See that your Hoary Heads be found in the Way of Righteousness!</HI> By such as have been cut down in the <HI>Flower</HI> of their <HI>Youth,</HI> GOD Speaks to <HI>Youth Men, Oh! Make Haste, and no Longer Delay to ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Commandments of your God!</HI> By the <HI>Little One</HI> whose <HI>Brains</HI> have been dash'd out, by the cruel Proselytes of <HI>Babylon,</HI> GOD Speaks to <HI>Children; Oh! Do you betimes fly to Me, and get under the Shadow of My Wings!</HI> Nor have the <HI>Handmaids</HI> of the Lord been unspoken to, in the horrid Things which <HI>their Sex</HI> has met withal. GOD Speaks to <HI>them; Oh! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> your Main concern, to be Espoused unto your only Saviour!</HI></P>
<P>I am Sure, There has been One Article of the <HI>Deadly Strokes,</HI> which it will be very Proper for <HI>Me</HI> to be deeply affected withal. And I make no doubt, that my Brethren will be so!</P>
<P>THERE have been Two MINISTERS, who have Owed their <HI>Deaths,</HI> unto the <HI>Sword</HI> by which we have been so harassed.</P>
<P>THE Hopeful Minister of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> was Kill'd in∣deed by a most <HI>Unhappy Mistake</HI> of a Souldier in his own Garrison. And might there not in such a thing be this <HI>Voice</HI> of our GOD, unto all our People, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ware lost you Kill your faithful M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isiors before you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="16" REF="001688_0017_0FB52A9CEB413A18"/>aware: Heart-breaking Temptations multiplyed upon them will do so.</HI></P>
<P>THE Worthy Minister of <HI>Haverhil,</HI> was Kill'd, in a Descent of the hideous Canibals upon his Neigh∣bourhood. In this <HI>Death,</HI> as well as in the Other, Methinks, I hear the <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of our Glorious Lord, unto the <HI>Pastors</HI> of His Churches; <HI>Oh! Look into your Hearts and Lives, to see what Share you also have in the Sins of the Times! Oh! Do with your Might what your Hand finds to do; as not knowing When or How you may be taken off! Oh! Do all you can to make my People Mind what I Speak unto them, in the Things which I do among them!</HI></P>
<P>AND, O BOSTON, The <HI>Wormwood and the Gall</HI> of thy <HI>Last Winter</HI> must be remembred with thee. I am Sure, with <HI>He</HI> it must be so. A Winter wherein One <HI>Dark Month</HI> carried off more than One Hundred and Ten of our Inhabitants. The <HI>Voice</HI> of it! — <HI>Behold, I have made thee Sick in Smi∣ting thee! Oh! Sin no more, Lest!</HI> —</P>
<P>SURELY then, it the <HI>Fourth</HI> Place; The <HI>Disap∣pointments</HI> of <HI>Important Expeditions,</HI> which in this <HI>Long War</HI> have humbled us, cannot but have in them a <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD; A <HI>Voice</HI> that should <HI>Strike us into the Dust</HI> before Him.</P>
<P>I will make all the Haste I can, to See whether no <HI>Comfortable Things</HI> have occurr'd for our Obser∣vation. But I would ask, that you would not be out of Patience, till I have gone thro' my Enu∣meration, of <HI>Afflictive</HI> Things, yet such as have been, and should be, very <HI>Instructive</HI> Ones.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001688_0018_0FB52A9E55BACA38"/>
I must remind you; That we have made many <HI>Salleyes</HI> into the <HI>Wilderness</HI> after the Enemy, with Numerous and Courageous <HI>Forces,</HI> and well-Equipped Ones. And we have sometimes made our <HI>Visits</HI> to the <HI>Head-Quarters</HI> of the Enemy, big with Hopes to do something upon them there. More than <HI>Ten Times,</HI> have our Forces returned from their Weary Marches, without Obtaining the Ends that were aimed at. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not for the Full Relation of such <HI>Expeditions.</HI> To wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Purpose, the Full Relation?— I have told yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>We went out, and we came home.</HI> — That's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Full Relation!</HI> — Indeed <HI>Much Good</HI> was done, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there was <HI>Nothing</HI> done.

<P>IF Mortified by what thus befel us <HI>by Land,</HI> what shall we say of what befel us <HI>by Sea?</HI> Our <HI>Mari∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Expeditions,</HI> What an amazing, What an abasing, <HI>Blast</HI> from GOD upon them! — All the Event of them, to bring <HI>Immense Debts</HI> upon us; to make us the <HI>Soorn</HI> of them that hate us; to Tire, and Cor∣rupt, and Confound, the Poor People Embarked in them! The <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD, still that; Hab.

<P>ONE considerable <HI>Armament,</HI> Ending with that Epitaph upon it; Lord, <HI>Thou hast cast us est, and put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Shame, and Goest not forth with our Armies.</HI></P>
<P>ANON, We do with a most Profound Obedience to the Commands of our Sovereign, and with a Wondrous Trouble and Expence, Propare for an

<P>SOME Years after, they <HI>did Come.</HI> The, <HI>Carthago <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elenda</HI> is again declared for.

<P>BUT, this we may do. We may Enquire into the <HI>Voice</HI> of our Glorious GOD unto us, in such Disastrous <HI>Disappointments?</HI></P>
<P>AND, <HI>O thou afflicted Country, so tossed with Tempests,</HI> and I had almost said <HI>Not Comforted;</HI> canst thou not hear this <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of thy GOD unto thee? <HI>O my People, Thou dost nor answer my Just Expectations; T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore dost thou miss of thy Expectations.

<P><PB N="19" REF="001688_0020_0FB52AA22EADB8E8"/>
IT would be a Sad Thing, if any <HI>Persons in Sta∣tions,</HI> have taken Advantages from the Distresses of the Country by the <HI>Long War,</HI> in Unrighteous, Un∣generous, Indirect Wayes to Propose the <HI>Enriching of themselves</HI> on the <HI>Miseries of their Country.</HI> I wish that <HI>Persons in Stations</HI> would Examine themselves, what <HI>Base Things</HI> may have been done this Way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that are to be Repented of.

<P>THE Incredible <HI>Miseries</HI> undergone by our <HI>Captives;</HI> What <HI>Labour,</HI> and What <HI>Hunger,</HI> and What <HI>Gold,</HI> they have endured! How <HI>Cruelly</HI> they have been used! How <HI>Cruelly</HI> they have been Scourged! With what <HI>Cruelties,</HI> the joynts of their Fingers have been bitten off!

There has been that <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD in these things unto us all; <HI>Oh! Be Thankful for the Comforts which you Enjoy in your Houses full of Good Things, with all your Friends
<PB N="20" REF="001688_0021_0FB52AA395AA0D10"/>about you!</HI> But at the same Time, there has been this <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of GOD unto them, who continue <HI>Captives</HI> to their <HI>Lusts,</HI> and will <HI>Go on still in their Trespasses:</HI> — <HI>What must you Look for, O Impenitent Sinners, what must you Look for, if you Dy in your Sins, and he delivered over into the Hands of those Tormentors, which are in the tremendous Place of Torments waiting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you!</HI></P>

I am Sure, There is this <HI>Voice</HI> of our GOD unto us, in their Condition; <HI>Oh! Be thankful for the Protestant Religion; the Precious Liberties and Instructions of your Holy Religion: Should you become a French Province, how forlorn, how rueful would be your Condition!</HI> But is there not herein also a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of our GOD, calling upon us, to take more Pains, that we may every where be well Englightened in the <HI>Religion</HI> of our Saviour; More Pains, that our <HI>Children,</HI> and all our <HI>People</HI> may be Supplyed from the <HI>Tower of David,</HI> with the Armour of Christia∣nity, to defend them from the <HI>Popish</HI> Abominations?

HOWEVER, At several times we have seen some Scores of our <HI>Captives</HI> delivered.

<P><PB N="22" REF="001688_0023_0FB52AA902B661B8"/>
SHALL I make a brief <HI>Recapitulation?</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured</HI> have we been of our GOD, in So Vigilant a Care, and Guard, which has kept our Frontiers, for <HI>Two Hundred</HI> Miles together, So Forti∣fied, and in such a Way of <HI>Communication,</HI> that the Salvages have been afraid of attempting Frequent <HI>Surprisals</HI> upon them? Our GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> this unto us; <HI>Behold, An Hedge of My making about you!</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> — When formidable Armies of the <HI>French,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>Salvages</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> several times, have <HI>gone forth with great fury to Destroy, and Utterly to make away many:</HI> and espe∣cially to Cut off the Praying People of God in the Towns of the Northern County on <HI>Connecticut-River:</HI> Either they have Mutiny'd among themselves; Or, some Deserter from themselves has come in unto us: — there has happened <HI>Something,</HI> that has caused them to do <HI>Nothing.</HI> When they have <HI>Come upon us, to Eat up our Flesh,</HI> they have <HI>Stumbled,</HI> and <HI>Fallen,</HI> and tho' after Long Marches, just arrived in our Borders, they have gone back without Striking a Stroke. Or, if not so, a <HI>Kind Friend</HI> of Ours, has Obliged us with a Timely Intelligence, of what Mis∣chief has been hatching against us; A Friendship for ever to be gratefully acknowledged!</P>
<P>UPON the Saying of which, I ought to Mention it, That there was in the <HI>Former War,</HI> a Gentleman, who hazarded his very Life, and Procured no little Uneasiness unto himself, by transmitting to us, an Advice of Mischiefs impending over us: The Me∣rits of which Action should not be soon forgotten with us.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="001688_0024_0FB52AAB2D2EC1D8"/>
BUT by such means as these, the Enemy, have hardly above <HI>Once,</HI> been able to do any thing to Purpose, in all their Enterprizes. They have <HI>gone round about the City, and made a Noise like a Dog:</HI> By'nd by they have <HI>Returned,</HI> and <HI>Wandred up and down for Meat,</HI> and <HI>grudged</HI> because they were <HI>not Satisfyed.</HI></P>
<P>GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> to us in this; <HI>Oh! Trust Me: Oh! Love Me; Oh! See what it is to be under My Pro∣tection!</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> — When the rich <HI>Store-Ships</HI> bound for <HI>Canada,</HI> and fill'd with Instruments of Death, have been taken by our <HI>Fleets;</HI> and the most Capable and Resolved Persecutors of these Colonies, have been Killed aboard them.</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> — When <HI>Privateers</HI> infesting our Coasts, have by Storms, <HI>[Fulfilling thy Word, O our God!]</HI> been Shipwreck'd on them. Or some of our Neighbours, Especially from One Helpful Island of our Neighbourhood, have with Sudden and Valiant Exploits, made them repent of their appreaching us.</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favour'd?</HI> — When we not only laid Waste many <HI>French</HI> Settlements, where the <HI>Indians</HI> had been Harboured and Supplyed; but anon their Citadel, with their whole Country, fell into our hands; and that <HI>Jericho,</HI> having been <HI>Comtessed Seven Dayes,</HI> fell before us. I Speak <HI>Literally</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nough in that Circumstance!</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> — In the Many and Ready Assistences, which our Brethren of the Neighbour
<PB N="24" REF="001688_0025_0FB52AAC97543E88"/>Colonies, have Lent unto us. Our GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> this unto us in it, <HI>Be Tender of One another! My Colonies, Love and Live as Brethren. I will have no unbrotherly Emulations among you.</HI></P>
<P>AND certainly the Assistences that we have given to our Neighbours, — Our Brethren in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> will certainly in all Things do the part of <HI>Our Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> — In that altho' the Prodigi∣ous <HI>Debts</HI> we have Contracted, One would have thought, must have broke us, yet we find our selves able to discharge these Ponderous <HI>Debts;</HI> Yea, our <HI>Debts</HI> have rather Enriched us, by affording a <HI>Fund</HI> for the <HI>Circulation of Credit,</HI> among us.</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Favoured?</HI> — When in the midst of <HI>Our</HI> Charges, and Losses, and Various Troubles, we have been mov'd and help'd from Above, to Express our Charity for our Friends in the <HI>Caribbee-Islands,</HI> and send some Taste of our Bounty to them in <HI>theirs.</HI> Let not Ignorant Strangers abuse <HI>New-England,</HI> un∣til they Out-do that Poor Country in the Things, that every One must Confess to be Laudable.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, Some Servants of God have had the <HI>Unspeakable Satisfaction</HI> of Expressing and Ob∣taining Bounties, for <HI>Odd People,</HI> among whom it has been a General Practice and Pleasure, to be Ig∣norantly and Venemously Railing at them. — <HI>For∣give them; They know not what they do!</HI></P>
<P>AND how <HI>Favoured?</HI> — When under all the <HI>Creepling Disadvantages</HI> of the Country, We see the
<PB N="25" REF="001688_0026_0FB52AAE15A7F9D0"/><HI>Metropolis</HI> of it, and of the whole English <HI>America,</HI> increase and flourish at such a rate? Yea, we see the ancient <HI>Fable</HI> of the <HI>Phaenix</HI> rising out of its <HI>Ashes,</HI> Moralized and Verified, O BOSTON, in thy rising out of <HI>thine:</HI> Things done for thee, the Re∣port whereof will be thought a <HI>Fable,</HI> by them that have not seen them.</P>
<P>SIRS, There is a <HI>Voice,</HI> yea, a <HI>Mighty Voice</HI> of our Glorious GOD unto us in all these things. He bespeaks our <HI>Thankful Praises,</HI> to Him, in all these things: This I am certain of!</P>
<P>IT must not be Left unconsidered among the <HI>Fa∣vours</HI> of our GOD, that we have all this while, Enjoy'd His GOSPEL, in the Privileges whereof we have been <HI>Lifted up to Heaven.</HI> Our GOD has fulfill'd that Word unto us; Isai. XXX. 20. <HI>Tho' they Lord give You the Bread of Adversity, and the Water of Affliction, yet thine Eyes shall see thy Teachers.</HI></P>
<P>ONE of the Least among them, is now doing his Part, that our <HI>Adversity</HI> and our <HI>Affliction</HI> may be rendred Profitable to us.</P>
<P>BUT, that our <HI>Matchless,</HI> and our <HI>Envy'd</HI> GOSPEL shall be continued unto us, do we see nothing like a <HI>Rainbow</HI> in the <HI>British-Heaven,</HI> to give us a <HI>Token,</HI> upon which they who <HI>dwell in the Wilderness</HI> may be less <HI>Afraid</HI> than a <HI>Cloudy Day</HI> may have sometimes rendered them?</P>
<P>YES, Unto our Inexpressible Satisfaction, we now see ascending to the <HI>British Throne,</HI> A KING, for whom his NEW-ENGLISH People have continually
<PB N="26" REF="001688_0027_0FB52AB055A277A8"/>Offered up their most Earnest <HI>Vows</HI> to the GOD <HI>by whom Kings Reign,</HI> that they may see Him, and His Illustrious Family, in the Succession runing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er them.</P>
<P>A KING, Who cannot in any of His Dominions, have more Loyal, Faithful, and Hearty Subjects, than His NEW-ENGLISH People; who are by <HI>Principle</HI> as well as <HI>Interest</HI> rendred so.</P>
<P>A KING, from whom we have all the Reason imaginable to Expect it, that He will not only Con∣tinue the <HI>Civil and Religious Liberties</HI> of a People who so many wayes recommend themselves unto. His <HI>Royal Chemency,</HI> but also that He will Multiply unto them the Tokens of His <HI>Paternal Benignity.</HI></P>
<P>MY Brethren, You hear the <HI>Voice</HI> of your Glorious GOD, even His <HI>Mighty Voice,</HI> in the Changes of His Providence that have Passed over you. A <HI>Voice</HI> that speaks this; <HI>Ah! My Poor People; How shall I give thee up: As yet, I cannot do it; I will not do it! Tho' I chasten thee sore, thou shalt not yet be given over to Death!</HI></P>
<P>I have discharged my Duty, and my Sermon shall be finished, when I have brought you the <HI>Voice</HI> of your GOD, in that One most Intelligible and Un∣questionable <HI>Articulation</HI> of it more; Psal. LXXXI. 13, 14, 15. <HI>Oh! that my People had hearkened unto me, and walked in my Wayes? I should soon have Subdued their Enemies, and have turned my Hand against their Ad∣versaries; The Haters of the Lord should have Submitted themselves unto Him; but their own Time should Endure for ever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Spicilegia.</HEAD>
<P>Upon a Review of the Occurrences in my Collection for our <HI>Duodecennium Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uosum,</HI> whereof I have in a <HI>Summary Way</HI> given the Publick a Deli∣bation, I take notice of Two or Three <HI>Specialties,</HI> which I shall for some Reasons more <HI>Particularly</HI> relate in an <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THE Action and Exploit of the MEN of Two Shallops belonging to the Religious Town of <HI>York, Sept.</HI> 21. 1707. as I have it, from a Good Friend, <HI>Samuel Penhallow</HI> <ABBR>Esqr.</ABBR> (to whom I have been En∣debted for very many such Communications,) appears not Unworthy of a Distinct Relation. Such a Per∣formance, and such a Deliverance, ought never to be forgotten!</P>
<P>ON board the Shallops, now lying at <HI>Winter-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bour,</HI> were the Courageous <HI>Austin,</HI> and <HI>Herman,</HI> and <HI>Cole,</HI> and five MEN more, and a <HI>Boy,</HI> who shall now pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a <HI>Man.</HI> About Fifty Canoes, in which were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or four or five Indians apiece, approach'd them, in a Square Body. When the Fleet was come within Thirty Yards of their intended Prey, Ours fired upon them, which first Shot put them into Extreme Disorder. The Indian Fleet again drawing up in Order of Battel, fired with such Fury, as obliged ours to quit One of the Shallops; which about fifty of the Enemy Entred, and got the Mainsail a-Trip, before ours could get the other to Sail. Ours therefore get out their Oars; but the Enemy was as quick as they, and they joyned Pad∣dles on both sides. Ours gaining on them, the Enemy got a dozen Canoes a head, with Fishing-lines, to tow
<PB N="28" REF="001688_0029_0FB52AB355D76288"/>after: But in about an hours time, the Wind so freshened up, that ours Left them, under certain Disadvantages, a quarter of a Mile astern. However the rest of the Cances, all this while Attending and Surrounding of our <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fully</HI> defended Shallep, kept incessantly Firing on our Men, who still bravely answered them They had a Long Engagement, and were so near One another, that ours felt the Fire of the Enemy in some sort almost Scorching of them. Tis an astonishing Thing! But in this Long &amp; Fierce &amp; Hot Engagement, not One of our good Men was killed. Onely One, whose Name was <HI>Donnel,</HI> (a <HI>Godly</HI> as well as a <HI>Valiant</HI> and for being so not at all the less <HI>Valiant,</HI> Man,) felt himself Shot thro' the Bowels, quickly after they first came to Sail. At his Fall, he said, <HI>I am a Dead Man!</HI> But removing himself a Little, he added, <HI>Let me Kill One before I dye!</HI> — but found himself not able to fire. — After three Hours, in which our Men Spent about five Pounds of Powder, and had not above a Quarter of a Pound Left, the dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irited Enemy drew off; but not without having a Considerable Number Killed &amp; Wounded; which tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Time, the continual Cloud of Smoke had Left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certain, was by Information afterwards ascertained. What can Good Men do, when GOD shall Spirit them, Strengthen them, and <HI>Protect</HI> them!</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> THESE had a more Significant <HI>Protection,</HI> than what was enjoy'd by the <HI>French Commander,</HI> in the Descent of the Indians upon <HI>Haverhil.</HI> That our Peo∣ple may be entertained with a Taste of the <HI>French Popery,</HI> and see a Little, by <HI>Whom</HI> and by <HI>What</HI> our Salvages have been animated; they shall be gratified with One Curiosity.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Aug.</HI> 20. 1708. about break of Day, an hundred and fifty Indians, with French Officers and Assistents,
<PB N="29" REF="001688_0030_0FB52AB5959E8008"/>broke in upon <HI>Haverhil,</HI> and Surprised the Center of the Town. Major <HI>Turner</HI> and Captain <HI>Price,</HI> with some small Forces happening to be Posted there, did with much Bravery, Resolution and Celerity, with half the Few Forces they had, give Battel to them; and in less than an Hour made them fly. Leaving Nine of their Number Dead, besides what of their Mortally Wounded they carried off.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Dead,</HI> there was a Distinguished French∣man, who had an <HI>Invulnerating,</HI> and <HI>Immortalizing Amu∣let</HI> about his <HI>Neck;</HI> which I now have in my Hand at the Time of my Writing. It was a Little Pouch, in which I find some small, <HI>Je ne scay quoy 's,</HI> of the Popish <HI>Leipsanolatry.</HI> But with them, a <HI>Schedule,</HI> on which there is drawn with <HI>Red Ink,</HI> the Pretended Figure of the Wound made by the Spear in the side of our Dying Saviour, with the Dimensions of it. Over it is Written, <HI>La Mesure de la Sainte Playe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sacree cote de notre Seigneur Jesus Chrit.</HI> Under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Salve Latus gloriosum Domini nosti Jesu Christi, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nobis Lancea Militis Perforatum.</HI> On the Backside <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Schedule is Written; <HI>Tous Ceux qui Portent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foy et devotion, la Mesure de la Sainte Playe du Sac Coté de nostre Seiqueur J. C'. Sont Preservez de beaucoup des Maux; Particulierement du Feu, de l'eau, de la peste, de les Tempesles, de toutes Blessures, et des Demons.</HI> [But, it seems, not from English Bullets!]</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> IN this <HI>Long War,</HI> there have now and then happened Things, that have had such Evident Signa∣tures of an <HI>Invisible World</HI> upon them, that they de∣serve to be considered. I shall Single out, but a Couple which are well-attested.</P>
<P>THE One is this. <HI>Plutarch</HI> and Others, have Sur∣prized us with Relations of <HI>Intelligence</HI> convey'd unto
<PB N="30" REF="001688_0031_0FB52AB7D59A4DD0"/>a Mighty Distance, from the Place of Action, in so short a Time, as was inconsistent with all Hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne Conveyance. One of the most Notable Things done in our <HI>Twelve-Year</HI> Darkness, was when Colonel <HI>Hil∣ton,</HI> meeting with an happy Information where they were, came upon a considerable Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in their Wigwams, and Slew all but One, whom they took a Prisoner. Tho' this was done thirty Leagues off <HI>Pertsmouth,</HI> yet in the very Morning, when it was done, they had a Distinct Account of it at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> (None knows how!) even in the Exact, and most Minute, Circumstances of it.</P>
<P>THE Other is this; One whose Name was <HI>John Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> was killed, by the <HI>Indians,</HI> at <HI>Exeter.</HI> Three Nights before this, he dream't, that he should be kill'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> at a certain <HI>Place,</HI> by his Bro∣thers Barn. This <HI>Place,</HI> he went each of the fol∣lowing Dayes to View; and show'd it unto his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghbours, and told them his Dream. At that very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, on that very <HI>Spot,</HI> it was accomplished.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> MEMORABLES relating to our Captives, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Collected in a Little Book Entituled, <HI>Good fetch'd</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Chil.</HI> It is to be hoped, that the Captives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Last Return, will add unto the Collection. May this be the Effect of all we have met withal. That is to Say, <HI>Good fetch'd out of Evil.</HI></P>
