<HEAD><HI>An ANSWER</HI> TO SOME <HI>Cases of Conscience</HI> Respecting the COUNTRY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLOMON STODDARD, A. M. Pastor in <HI>Northampton.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>Quest. I. <HI>WHEREIN doth the oppression of the Country principally consist?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> THERE is an oppression of R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers often spoken of in Scripture. But besides that, there is an oppression contrary to commutative Justice: this is committed principally in these three ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN they make the advantage of the ignorance of others. Men that are otherwise, knowing Men, are ignorant of the worth of some Commodities; and Men take that opportunity to extort from them. Men that are ignorant of the worth of things, have a dependance on the Integrity of the Seller, who thereby hath an Advantage to gain more than is meet. Sometimes they get twice the value of it. Mens ignorance doth expose them to become a prey to greedy Men. The Seller knows that could sell it cheaper; but the Buyer is ignorant, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Sometimes Men sell that which is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that which is commendable. The Apothecary sells his Drugs that have lost their vertue through age, to ignorant Men. It is an easy thing for crafty Men to abuse those that are ignorant. And in Coun∣try Towns. Men sometimes give a shilling for that, which at the Mar∣ket Town, might be had for six pence.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="002387_0002_0FDB350AC7B35040"/>
2. WHEN they make their advantage of the Necessities of particular Men: When there is a general Scarcity, the Market-price will inavoi∣dably rise; but where there is no Market, particular persons may be in great necessity; there be few in that Town that can supply them. If they go to another Town to buy, the charge will be considerable; the Man is also in a strait because strangers will not trust him, and the Seller takes that advantage to oppress him; the Scripture takes notice of the oppressing the poor, <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.16. <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.31. It may be Lawyers may be guilty of taking excessive Fees.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN they take the advantage on the good nature &amp; ingenuity of other Men, by lying in Debt beyond the proper time of payment, Mul∣titudes of people in the Country are not beforehand, they spend their Money before they have it; the extravagancy of their expences forces them to lie in Debt; the inevitable Providence of GOD casts some Men behind hand; in that case they should compound with their Creditors: but some through a profuse way of living, can't conveniently pay their Debts: Hereby the Creditor is reduced to straits, looses the improve∣ment of his own Estate; and sometimes the Debt is lost; the Debtor dies, and there is no Estate; the Creditor dies, and the Children can never recover their Father's dues. GOD was very strict in requiring to pay the hireling his wages. <HI>Lev.</HI> 19.13.</P>
<P>Q. II. <HI>IS it lawfull for Men to set their Dwelling Houses at such a distance from the place of Publick Worship, that they and their Families cannot well attend it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> IT is lawfull to do it when a few make a beginning of a new Plantation under a prospect of obtaining the Ordinances in a little time. But it is quite Unwarrantable, where there is no such prospect.</P>
<P>WE read in Scripture of a <HI>Sabbath days journey:</HI> Acts 1.12. but that was a tradition, not an injunction. Some take it to be a Mile; some, two Miles, according to the different sort of Cubits. It is tho't that the Armies of <HI>Israel</HI> incamped in the Wilderness at that Distance from the Tabernacle, <HI>Num.</HI> 2.2. They are ordered to pitch over against the Tabernacle; we read it, far off about the Tabernacle. This is thought to be 2000 Cubits; because there was to be that distance be∣tween the Tabernacle and the People, when they passed over <HI>Jordan, Josh.</HI> 3.4. But supposing this to be, it will not prove that two Mile
<PB N="3" REF="002387_0003_0FDB350C427DF468"/>was a Sabbath days journey. For there is reason to think that when the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> encamped in the Wilderness, they took up the space of Twelve Miles square; so that some of them would be six Miles off from the Tabernacle.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. THE Prophet, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 8.1, 2. <HI>directed</HI> the woman of <HI>Shun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to remove out of the Country, because of an approaching Famin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and she sojourned in the land of the <HI>Philistines</HI> seven Years. And it is very probable, that thó the <HI>Israelites</HI> were cut off from worship∣ping at the Temple, being commanded to sacrifice at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> yet they had places near, where the law was publickly read, and pub∣lick Prayers made: yet she is directed to live else where.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> THE Land of the <HI>Philistines</HI> joined to the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> and she might have opportunity by going two or three Miles, to join with some of <HI>Israel</HI> in Worship; yea the north-east parts of the Land of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> was not very far from the Temple at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and she might have better opportunity for Worship, than in her own Land.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. IT seems the Woman of <HI>Shunem</HI> was wont to travel on the Sabbath to Mount <HI>Carmel,</HI> which was twelve Miles, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 4.25.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> IT doth not appear that it was ordinary for her to go thither on the Sabbath; thô possibly she might on some extraordinary occasions.</P>
<P>Q. III. <HI>IS not the depreciating the Bills of Publick Credit matter of Provocation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> IT must needs be; for great wrong is done to many Persons who have received them according to their denomination; and have been forced to put them off as if they were of less Value. Some Men are able to help themselves, by getting greater wages for their Work, and advancing the price of what they bring to the Market; but others have been great Sufferers by this practice; and if ever the Bills are called in; such as are in debt, either to the Publick, or to particular Persons, will be great loosers. It may be, some of them will be undone thereby. The temptation to the Merchants was to get the Money into their own hands, that thereby they might make Returns to <HI>England.</HI> They would give thirty shillings in <HI>Eills,</HI> for twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Silver.</HI> And they may afford it, that have Sold, and do sell, their Goods at execessive Rates. They are under no necessity to do thus: for they have the command of the Market, and might buy the
<PB N="4" REF="002387_0004_0FDB351006F76E98"/>produce of the Country at such prices, that they might make as profi∣table Returns, as now they do.</P>
<P>Q. IV. <HI>Is it Lawfull to wear long Hair?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> IT was the Custom in <HI>England</HI> to cut their Hair all off, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> humour, as Dr. <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> off his Hair. This custom continued for about threescore years: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by degrees. Men took a greater liberty; thô some Men placed Re∣ligion in it: yet in length of time, they were not so scrupulous as for∣merly. And some wore their Hair very long. And many of those that wear Periwigs, use such as are of a very great length. And the custom doth now prevail among Pious People. But it seems utterly Unlawful to wear their Hair long; It is a geat Burden and Cumber; it is Effi∣minacy, and a vast Expence.</P>
<P>ONE Scripture that condemns it, 1 Cor. 11.14. <HI>Doth not even nature it self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you, that if a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long hair, it is a shame to him?</HI> That which the light of Nature condemns, is a Moral Evil. The light of Nature is to be our Rule in ordinary cases. The reason why it is a shame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wear long Hair is, because it is a Sin: the light of Nature doth condemn it; therefore it is sinfull.</P>
<P>THE principal Objection that is brought to evade the Authority of this Place, is. That by <HI>Nature,</HI> Custom is meant. So Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it: I judge he doth it, that he may strengthen himself in his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> that he may have the better pretence to expound it so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 2.3. where it is said, <HI>We are by nature children of wrath, even as others.</HI> His Exposition there is contrary to the Rule of <HI>Faith;</HI> and in this Place, contrary to the Rule of <HI>Life.</HI> We sometimes say that Custom is a second nature: yet it is never so used in the Scripture: the Inter∣pretation is without Precedent: and the Apostle being presently after t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speak of Custom, useth another word: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.16. He saith, We have no such <HI>Custom.</HI> The Apostles Expression is very remarkable, He saith <HI>even Nature it self,</HI> as if he had foreseen that Men would put a false interpretation on his words. He doth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tent himself to say, <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> but that they may not suppose he meant <HI>Custom.</HI> He saith, <HI>Even Nature it self</HI> U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly he was guided therein by the Spirit of GOD. <HI>Besides,</HI> it was not true, that <HI>Custom</HI> taught them that it was a shame for a Man to wear long H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for it was the <HI>Custom</HI> of the <HI>Greeks</HI> to wear
<PB N="5" REF="002387_0005_0FDB351134DE7068"/>their Hair <HI>long:</HI> The <HI>Remans</HI> wore their Hair <HI>short;</HI> but the <HI>Greeks</HI> wore their Hair <HI>long. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer</HI> calls the Grecians <HI>Comati Acbivi.</HI> And when <HI>Alexander</HI> was in a rage with <HI>Cassander</HI> one of his Nobles; he took him by the Hair, and knocked his head against the wall. Moreover in the next verse, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.13. The Apostle to shew, that Nature teaches Wo∣men to wear their Hair <HI>long;</HI> He saith, <HI>if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering.</HI> GOD gave it to <HI>Women</HI> for a covering, but not to <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER Scripture doth also condemn it, <HI>viz.</HI> Ezek. 44.20. <HI>Nei∣ther shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long, they shall only poll their heads.</HI> Here are two Extreams forbid; <HI>Shaving the head,</HI> and <HI>suffering their locks to grow long.</HI> This must either signify some spiritual thing; but no Man can devise what; or some Gospel In∣stitution; and if so, why is it not enjoyned unto Ministers in the New Testament, or else it is a Moral Law: and so it must be. One part of it, is surely Moral; <HI>They shall not shave their heads;</HI> therefore the other part is Moral also; <HI>They shall not suffer their locks to grow long.</HI></P>
<P>THE Command of GOD requiring the Nazarites to nourish their Hair, is no vindication of long Hair; but a forcible reason against it; which will appear, if we consider two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. SUCH Actions, as under their <HI>ordinary</HI> circumstances are Moral Evils; under <HI>extraordinary</HI> circumstances, be very good: So for <HI>Brothers</HI> and <HI>Sisters</HI> to joyn in Wedlock, as <HI>Adam's</HI> Children did: For the <HI>Brother,</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> to Marry his <HI>Brother</HI>'s Wife: So, for a Physician, to give an intoxicating Potion: to do that which ordinarily, is contrary to a Rule of Modesty. One Command, in many cases, must give way to another.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Nazarites were to deny themselves many comforts, to shew us that we should be mortified to the things of this World. Upon a Religious account, they were to abstain from Wine &amp; Raisins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and upon that account, they were to deny themselves of that neatness and comeliness in wearing their Hair, that was a duty in other Men.</P>
<P>IT was a part of the Calamity that came upon <HI>Nebuchadne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar,</HI> that his Hairs were grown like Eagles Feathers, <HI>and his Nailes like birds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laws,</HI> Dan. 4.23.</P>
<P>[The following Letter, written by the same learned Author many years ago, may be here inserted.]</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="6" REF="002387_0006_0FDB351298A59DB8"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with your desire, I now send you my Thoughts con∣cerning <HI>Periwigs.</HI> I cannot see sufficient Reason to condemn them Universally. GOD does allow Man, by <HI>Art</HI> to supply the defects of <HI>Nature.</HI> Hair artificially prepared may supply as fully &amp; innocently, the want of Hair, as any other matter artificially prepared.</P>
<P>But yet I judge that there is abundance of Sin, in this Country, in wearing <HI>Perwigs.</HI> Particularly, in these two things;</P>
<P>First, When Men do wear them needlessly, in compliance with the Fashion. Their own Hair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficient for all those Ends that GOD has given Hair for. One Man's Hair is comlier than another's. And so it is with their Faces, and Bodies. Some cut off their Own because of the Colour; it is <HI>Red</HI> or <HI>Grey;</HI> Some, because it is <HI>Streight;</HI> Some, be∣cause it is <HI>Frizel'd;</HI> and some, only, because it is their <HI>Own.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, When those that may have just occasion to wear them, doe wear them in such a Ruffianly way, as it would be utterly unlaw∣full to wear their own Hair in. Some of them are of an un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asonable <HI>Length;</HI> and generally, they are extravagant as to their <HI>Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yness.</HI></P>
<P>We have no certain way to pass a Judgment upon this <HI>Practice,</HI> but by comparing it with such general Moral Rules, as we are bound to Ob∣serve. It renders it somewhat <HI>Suspicious,</HI> that the <HI>Practice</HI> did at first take it's rise from very <HI>Corrupt</HI> Men; and that it was long, before it did obtain among those that were <HI>godly.</HI> But if it disagree with Moral Rules; it is altogether to be Condemned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Practice</HI> seems, to me, to have these four <HI>Evils</HI> in it:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is an <HI>Uncontentedness</HI> with that Provision that GOD has made for Men. GOD has generally given Men such Hair as is co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly; and a sufficiency of it. And when it is so, Men have cause to be well satis∣fyed. When GOD has given to Men such Hair as is sutable to answer the Ends of Hair; It seems to be a <HI>Despising</HI> of the Goodness of GOD, to cut it off, in compliance with a Vain Fashion. If GOD lay Affliction upon them; they may use lawfull Methods, to moderate the Affliction: But these Men, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> GOD be Bountifull to them, <HI>are not Contented to be at His Finding.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is <HI>Wastifullness.</HI> Abundance of Money is <HI>needlessly</HI> spent in maintaining this <HI>Practice.</HI> Some of the Men that use it, have need enough of the Money other ways; and lay themselves under Tempta∣tion by this <HI>Extravagancy,</HI> either to oppress Men in their Dealings<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or
<PB N="7" REF="002387_0007_0FDB3513DB583A98"/>to be more Pinching in other Cases, than they ought to be. And those Men that have more plentiful Estates, have no Liberty to use them ac∣cording to their own Pleasure. That Money that may be laid out to <HI>Advantage,</HI> should not be spent <HI>Unprofitably.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is <HI>Pride:</HI> they do it to make a great <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>;</HI> It is from an Affectation of <HI>Swaggering;</HI> it is an Affecting of <HI>Finery</HI> that there is no just occasion for. They count it <HI>Brave</HI> to be in the Fashion; crave the honour of being counted as <HI>Gallant</HI> as others. It is too much <HI>Flanting.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is <HI>contrary to Gravity.</HI> There is a Masculine Gravity that should appear in the Countenances of Men, discovering a Solemnity of Spirit. But this <HI>Fractice</HI> is <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Effeminat.</HI> Tho it make a <HI>Shew;</HI> yet it takes much away from the Presence of Men. Such <HI>Curipsity</HI> dis∣covers much <HI>Vanity</HI> in the Mind; and makes others to esteem the more lightly of them; and not to shew that Respect to them. This <HI>Practice</HI> makes them look, as if they were more dispos'd <HI>to Court a Maid;</HI> than to bear upon their Hearts the weighty Concernments of GOD's King∣dom.</P>
<P>But I am fearful that the Stream runs so strong this way, that no Endeavours will work a Publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ormation; until GOD does give Men another Spirit; or lay them under other Dispensations. Yet it may not be without good Effect on some particular Persons, if a Testi∣mony be born against the <HI>Practice;</HI> if not to <HI>Reduce</HI> any; yet to <HI>Pre∣vent</HI> some that were in danger.</P>
<P>Thus Sir, I have endeavoured to give some Satisfaction to your Desires; which I hope you will take in good part, from your Servant.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Q. V. <HI>WHAT Night doth belong to the Sabbath?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> THE Night before the Sabbath-day. These two Considera∣tions clear it.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT from the Beginning, the Sabbath began in the Evening. That Text, <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.32.— <HI>From evening to evening, ye shall celebrate your Sabbath,</HI> doth immediately respect the day of Expiation; but that is to be kept as a Sabbath; from evening, to evening. But this doth further evidence it, because the First Sabbath began in the evening. When the Evening and the Morning had made the Sixth Day: as soon as the Sixth day was past, the Sabbath began: and so it continued,
<PB N="8" REF="002387_0008_0FDB35174F750030"/>during the Time of the Old Testament. And if the Christian Sabbath began in the Morning, the seventh part of time is not kept.</P>
<P N="2">2. THO' the Resurrection of CHRIST made a change of the day; yet there is no reason that the Time of the day when He rose, should make a change of the Time of the day wherein the Sabbath should begin.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) BECAUSE the Scripture doth not assure us in what exact Time CHRIST rose: if GOD had appointed that we should begin the Sab∣bath then, He would have given us light to know when that Time was: for the Scripture is a perfect Rule. But none of the Pen-men do design to tell us the Exact Time when CHRIST Rose.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IT is not the manner of Men, when Solemnities are kept in Memory of some great thing that hapned on such a day, to have a re∣gard to the Time of the day; as in keeping Princes Birth-days. So among the <HI>Jews,</HI> they had no regard as to the Circumcising of their Children, to the Time of day when they were born. If a Child were born on the Sabb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, an hour <HI>before</HI> Sun-set, it might be Circumcised the next Sahbath an hour <HI>after</HI> Sun-rise, when it was not compleatly seven days old.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) WE have no reason to think that in the first Institution of the Sabbath, GOD had a respect to the very Moment of Time when He ceased from the Work of Creation. The Woman was the last Creature that was made on the Sixth day; but we have no ground to think that She was made the last hour of that day. The sixth day was a working day: but we have no reason to think, that GOD was creating all that day.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>AT what Time of the Evening doth the Sabbath begin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> JUST at Sun-set. There be some in this Country that be∣gin the Sabbath in the dusk of the Evening, when the Darkness pre∣vails over the Light. They ground their Opinion on that Scripture, Neh. 13.19. <HI>And it came to pass when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark</HI> before <HI>the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, &amp;c.</HI> But this place doth not prove their Opinion; For the word in the Origi∣nal is, <HI>When the gates of Jerusalem begar to be shaded;</HI> which might be some considerable time before the Sabbath; <HI>Jerusalem</HI> being compassed with Mountains.</P>

AND when the Sun set on the sixth Day, there were six days com∣pleat, and the Sabbath began. And it is determined by GOD, that then it is Even, when the Sun is set. Lev. 22.6. 7. The <HI>Seal</HI> which hath <HI>touched any such, shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless be wash his flesh with water; and when the Sun is down he shall be clean.</HI> The like is Deut. 23.11. <HI>When evening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth ex, he shill wash himself with water; and when the Sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.</HI> And it was counted both by the <HI>Jews</HI> &amp; Heathens, that when the Sun was down, the Day was at an end. <HI>Judg.</HI> 14.18. <HI>The men of the city said thas to him on the seventh day before the Sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?</HI> Had the Sun been down, they had lost their wager. 2 <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 3.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>David s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are, saying, so do God to me, end more also, if I taste <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead or ought else, till the Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be down.</HI> Exod. 22.3.</P>
<P>Q. VI. <HI>IS not Unfaithfulness in Officers, and private Persons, a Provocation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Undoubtedly it is. We may suppose that Magistrates and Mini∣sters, were they informed, would bear a due Testimony against Drun∣kenness, Sabbath-breaking, and other fins. But such things are seldom punished, for want of information. Many persons are bound by Church-Covenant to watch over others, and Officers are bound by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath, to inquire into Disorders, and give information. But many times there is a fame of such things, but seldom Complaint is made to Authority. Possibly, some Persons are obnoxious themselves, and are afraid that if they bring out others, that they shall be brought out.</P>
<P>BUT the great Reason of this is the want of a Spirit of Religion: Men are not concerned for the Honour of GOD, the preventing of Judgments, and the Recovery of their Brethren. They are asraid that others will be disgus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, that it will be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dation of ill-will and Contention. Officers don't consider the solemn Bonds that they are under, and the Account they must give to GOD of their Oaths. It may be, they Pray that Sin may be parged out of the Land; and that Religion may flourish; but they are notoriously negligent of doing what GOD and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002387_0011_0FDB351F03477E28"/>
Q. VH. <HI>IS not the neglect of bringing others to the Profession of Religion, a Provocation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT must needs be. It was foretold of CHRIST, that <HI>all nations shall call him blessed,</HI> Psal. 72.7. <HI>GOD promised to Him that He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give Him the Heathen for his luberitance,</HI> Psal. 2.8. And it is a part of that Love and Duty which we owe to JESUS CHRIST, and to the Souls of Men, as we have opportunity, to be prevailing with other Peo∣ple to give entertainment to the Gospel. Great pains were taken that way in the first Ages of Christianity, and with great Success: But there is great reason to fear, that we have not answered GOD's expecla∣tion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE has been a neglect of bringing some of our own Nation to the Profession of the Gospel. Many in, and about <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> and in the <HI>Naraganset</HI>-Country, have fallen into Heresy; and some almost into Heathenism. And we have been too much unconcerned about re∣ducing them unto the Right way: We have reason to reflect on those Words to the Shepherds of <HI>Israel,</HI> Ezek. 34.4. <HI>The diseased have ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strengthned, neuber have ye bealed that which was sick; neither have ye bound up that which was broken; neither have ye brought again that which was driven away; neither have ye sought that which was left.</HI> There has been something done of late Years, at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-Island</HI> &amp; the places adju∣cent; and it has not been without Effect. But it was too long before it was taken in hand, and has not been followed with sufficient Applica∣tion: If we had done much more, it would have been more Acceptable to GOD. When the Kingdom of CHRIST doth not flourish, Satan's Kingdom will prevail. Our Diligence might have prevented the growth of Atheism and Prophaneness, and have preserved many from falling in with the Apostacy.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE has been a neglect to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Profession of the Gospel. Something has been done through the Piety of particu∣lar Men; and at the Cost of some in <HI>Old England;</HI> But we are reproach∣ed abroad for our Negligence. Many Men have been more carefull to make a Prey of them, then to gain them to the Knowlege of CHRIST. The King in the CHARTER says, that the Undertakens did profess it to be their principal design to bring the Natives to the Knowledge of GOD. But we have very much failed of prosecuting that Design to Effect. We must bring them to Civility and to learn our Language. <HI>Paul</HI> says to
<PB N="12" REF="002387_0012_0FDB3521F687F218"/>the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> I <HI>seek not yours but you,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.14. The Reverse is too true of <HI>New-England.</HI> It may be, on that account GOD hath made them to be a scourge to us. GOD says to <HI>Ecekiel, Thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech, and of an hard language — Surely had I sent thee to them, they would have bearkned unto thee,</HI> Ezek. 3.5, 6. We have reason to fear, that we are much to blame for their continu∣ance in their Heathenism.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE have Neglected to bring <HI>Servants</HI> to the Profession of Religion. Some Men are careful to make their Servants learn their Catechism, to make them attend Family, and Publick Worship. But Servants should be brought to the Profession of Religion; they need to practise Religion, as well as their Masters; and their Masters are bound to take care of their <HI>Souls</HI> as well as their <HI>Bodies.</HI> GOD required <HI>Abraham</HI> to circum∣cise his <HI>Servants,</HI> as well as his <HI>Children,</HI> Gen. 17.12, 13. Here you may observe two things. 1. GOD says, <HI>They must needs be circumcised.</HI> 2. GOD makes this to be a Token of his Covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> &amp; his Posterity. If they had proper Helps, they might be as forward in Religion, as the <HI>English.</HI> It has been the misery of <HI>New-England,</HI> that under a fear of polluting the Ordinances; they have neglected pro∣per means to make Men godly.</P>
<P>Q VIII. <HI>DID we any wrong to the</HI> Indians <HI>in buying their Land at a small price?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. THERE was some part of the Land that was not purchased, neither was there need that it should; it was <HI>vacuum domicilium;</HI> and so might be possessed by virtue of GOD's grant to Mankind, Gen. 1.28. <HI>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> made no use of it, but for Hunting. By GOD's first Grant Men were to subdue the Earth. When <HI>Abraham</HI> came into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> he made use of vacant Land as he plea∣sed: so did <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI>

Q. IX. <HI>IS not the Multiplying of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its at Law a Provo∣cation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT must needs be so: It is a Sign of Contention, and a <HI>Cause</HI> of Contention. <HI>Moses</HI> complains of it, <HI>Deut.</HI> 1.12. <HI>How can I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y self alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</HI> And it occasions a great deal of <HI>Expence:</HI> and great <HI>Loss of Time.</HI> It is in this case generally as it is in War, that one party, if not both, are to blame, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.6.</P>
<P N="1">1. SOMETIMES it rises from the Injustice or Unmercifulness of the Plaintiff. The King of the <HI>Ammonites</HI> challenged what was not his due, <HI>Judg.</HI> 12.12. And the Servant did very ill, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook his fellow servant by the throat for a small debt, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.28.</P>
<P N="2">2. SOMETIMES from Dishonesty, or Disingenuity of the Defendant. Many Men lie shamefully in Debt, and break their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which is a just Provocation to others to Sue them; They bring others under such necessity, that they will be great sufferers, if they do not seek their Re∣medy at the Law. The Rule is, <HI>That we owe no man any thing but Love,</HI> Rom. 13.8.</P>
<P N="4">4. SOMETIMES through the greediness of <HI>Lawyers:</HI> the more Men contend at Law, the more <HI>they</HI> gain and they stir up strise among Neigh∣bours: and when Persons are Cast, perswade them to Appeal; say to them, as <HI>Absolom</HI> in another cafe, 2 Sam. 15.3. <HI>See, thy matters are good and right.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002387_0015_0FDB352996403A60"/>
Quest. X. <HI>IS not a spirit hankering after Ceremonies that are not Instituted by GOD, a Provocation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> YES, because it is contrary to the Second Commandment: Exod. 20.4. <HI>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is an Arrogating a Power that GOD hath not given to Men. It may be said to them that do it, <HI>Who gave you this Authority?</HI> Deoency, and Order may be without any new Ceremonies: <HI>Jerebeam</HI> was taxed for assuming a Power that did not belong to him: 1 King. 12.33. <HI>So be affered upon the alter which be had made in Bethel, the fifteenth day of the Eighth Month, even in the Month which he had devised of his own heart</HI> —.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is a Reflecti on on the Wisdom of GOD; as if they could Mend His Institutions: As if they could find out a Better way of Wor∣ship, than He hath Appointed, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.23.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is a Presuming on a Blessing without a Divine Warrant: <HI>Math.</HI> 15.9. Teaching doctrines [<HI>which are</HI>] commandments of men.</P>
<P>THERE be many other Practices that are plainly Contrary to the Light of Nature.</P>
<P><HI>HOOPED</HI> Petticoats have some∣thing of Nakedness; Mixt Dancings are incentives to Lust; Compo∣tations in Private Houses, is a Drunken Practice.</P>

<L>So false Religions shall decay,</L>
