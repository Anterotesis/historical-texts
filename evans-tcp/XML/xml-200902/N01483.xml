<Q><BIBL>Haggai. II. 6, 7.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the Heavens, and the Earth,</HI> —</P>
<P><HI>And I will shake all Nations,</HI> —</P></Q>

<P>IT is a Passage Occurring in very Ancient Records; Psal. LXXIV. 14. <HI>Thou brakest the Heads of Leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat unto the People inhabiting the Wilder∣ness.</HI> When the People of God Enjoy'd the Satisfaction of seeing a <HI>Pharaoh</HI> taken out of the World, then was that Word ac∣complished.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001763_0003_0FB7CD8BFA333738"/>
The Man to whom Statues were Erected, with the Title of, <HI>The Immortal Man,</HI> upon their Pedestal, is by the stroke of <HI>Death</HI> now laid in the Grave.</P>
<P>The King who suffered himself to be blasphemously called, <HI>The Almighty,</HI> is crushed like a <HI>Worm</HI> under the foot of the <HI>Lord God Omnipotent.</HI></P>
<P>The Tyrant, who about Thirty Years ago boasted on his Medals, [<HI>O Mighty Man, boasting in Mischief!</HI>] That he had brought about the <HI>Conversion of Twenty Hundred Thousand,</HI> whom he called <HI>Hereticks;</HI> You know by what Unparallel'd <HI>Barbarities;</HI> You know to what Abominable <HI>Idolatries;</HI> — He is now buried under that Epitaph; <HI>The Man of the Earth shall Op∣press no more.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly all the Servants of God in the World, will on this Occasion adore the Hand of the Glorious GOD, <HI>breaking in pie∣ces the Head</HI> of a <HI>Leviathan.</HI></P>
<P>Sure I am, If after the Setting up of <HI>Popery in the Plantations,</HI> had been Engaged unto him, when we had a <HI>Popish King</HI> upon the
<PB N="3" REF="001763_0004_0FB7CD8CE2948230"/>Throne, (as has been since discovered,) a most Seasonable Revolution had not pre∣vented <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is taking Possession of this Country, we had found him a <HI>Leviathan.</HI> The Jawes of the fiercest <HI>Crocodile</HI> would have been full of <HI>Tender Mercies,</HI> in Comparison of his Merciless <HI>Cruelties.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Entertainment</HI> for the <HI>People Inhabi∣ting the Wilderness,</HI> is to be Considered on this Occasion. Our God provides an <HI>En∣tertainment</HI> for us. And what can more a∣greeably, or more deliciously <HI>Entertain</HI> us, than a View of the Wonderful <HI>Shakes,</HI> which the Great God is upon giving to the <HI>Nati∣ons,</HI> yea, to <HI>all Nations,</HI> upon such a Dis∣pensation!</P>
<P>Our Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> under the Inspirati∣ons of God, animated a discouraged and a dilatory People, to go on with rebuilding the Temple at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> To this Purpose, a <HI>Greater Glory</HI> is promised for the Second, than had been Enjoy'd by the Former Tem∣ple. A <HI>Greater Glory!</HI> Not in regard of a Pompous and Splendid Appearance. Nor do I take the Story that <HI>Josephus</HI> gives us,
<PB N="4" REF="001763_0005_0FB7CD8F07DD2730"/>of what was done by <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, un∣to it, for to be much better than a <HI>Romance,</HI> of Incredible &amp; Ill-designed Exaggerations. But the <HI>Greater Glory,</HI> was to be in the Coming of the <HI>Messiah</HI> thither; in the Pre∣sence and Preaching of the <HI>Son of God Incar∣nate</HI> there.</P>
<P>Concerning this <HI>Coming</HI> of our Saviour, we have here Two Things remarked.</P>
<P>First; It was to be <HI>in a little while.</HI> T'was indeed Five hundred Years off. But then, three thousand and five hundred Years had passed since the First Promise of it. What remained, was but <HI>a little while,</HI> to what had already passed. It is but <HI>a little while</HI> unto Him, with whom a <HI>Thousand Years</HI> is but as <HI>One Day.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; <HI>All Nations</HI> were to be <HI>Sha∣ken,</HI> to prepare them for such a Blessing. The Fulfilment of the Promise was to be brought on with very <HI>Shaking</HI> Dispensati∣ons. The <HI>Shake upon all Nations,</HI> is here Metaphorically described, and perhaps also distinguished, by a <HI>Shake</HI> upon the <HI>Heavens,</HI> or the Upper World; and upon the <HI>Earth;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001763_0006_0FB7CD90AD426530"/>both the <HI>Sea</HI> and the <HI>Dry Land,</HI> which be∣longs unto the <HI>Earth;</HI> or the Lower World.</P>
<P>This is what we are now to pay Regard unto.</P>
<P><HI>There are Times, wherein the Glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth, will Shake the Nations of the World; yea, Shake both Heaven and Earth in the disturbed Nations.</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Text</HI> shall be a little more particular∣ly Explained, before my <HI>Doctrine</HI> be prose∣cuted.</P>
<P>A King of <HI>Persia</HI> comes out against the <HI>Greeians,</HI> with the biggest Army that ever was heard of: But besides his <HI>Army</HI> at Land, his <HI>Navy</HI> at Sea, was horribly defeated. So did the <HI>Lord shake the Earth &amp; the Sea!</HI> After this, <HI>Alexander</HI> the King of <HI>Greein,</HI> does annoy and destroy the <HI>Persians;</HI> and by his Victorious Arms, he made all <HI>the Nations to Shake.</HI> The Successors of that Emperour, dividing the Empire, fell out a∣mong themselves; Especially the Kings of the <HI>North</HI> and of the <HI>South;</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> that is, and of <HI>Egypt;</HI> who made the <HI>Nations to
<PB N="6" REF="001763_0007_0FB7CD938975C4A8"/>Shake still</HI> by their Bloody Wars. After this, the <HI>Romans</HI> Invaded and Conquered <HI>Grecia:</HI> And at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngth <HI>Civil Wars</HI> fell out among the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves; in which Wars there were some terrible <HI>Sea-fights.</HI> Thus the Lord made the <HI>Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Dry∣land,</HI> and <HI>all Nations</HI> to <HI>Shake.</HI> Finally, the <HI>Romans</HI> brought a Desolation upon the whole Jewish State, both Civil and Sacred; wherein the Lord <HI>Shook,</HI> not the <HI>Earth</HI> only, but the <HI>Heavens</HI> also.</P>
<P>Our First Enquiry now shall be,</P>
<P><HI>HOW 'tis</HI> that our Glorious LORD, will <HI>Shake the Nations,</HI> yea, <HI>Shake both Heaven &amp; Earth</HI> about them?</P>
<P>First. There are Times wherein <HI>Shakes</HI> are given to the <HI>Corporeal World; Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> Literally taken, are wonderfully <HI>Shaken,</HI> and unto the Terror of the Nations.</P>
<P>The <HI>God that formed all things,</HI> has put all Things into an incomparable <HI>Order.</HI> But sometimes the World may be put some∣what out of the <HI>Order</HI> wherein tis ordinarily carried on. When the <HI>course</HI> of the World is altered, by any <HI>Extraordinary</HI> work or
<PB N="7" REF="001763_0008_0FB7CD95097C15D8"/>change upon it, then does the Great God give a <HI>Shake</HI> unto it.</P>
<P>Can <HI>Heaven</HI> be <HI>shaken?</HI> Yes. Prodigi∣ous <HI>Thunderings</HI> and <HI>Lightnings</HI> in <HI>Hea∣ven,</HI> are some <HI>shaking</HI> of Heaven. Thus the Lord <HI>shook Heaven,</HI> at the giving of the Law, when the <HI>Thunders</HI> &amp; <HI>Lightenings</HI> were such as to make <HI>Moses</HI> himself cry out, <HI>I exceedingly fear &amp; quake.</HI> Of this we read; Psal. LXVIII. 8. <HI>The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of the Lord.</HI> And so, when the <HI>Stars in their Courses fight</HI> against the Enemies of God, by raising any Destructive Tempest upon them; <HI>Heaven</HI> is then <HI>shaken</HI> in it and for it. There is also a <HI>shaking</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> when any real Prodigies do there show themselves: for so we may suppose there sometimes do, without our falling into the whimsies of a fanciful and credulous <HI>Livy</HI> about them. The Learned Man, who wrote against the Regard of all such Things, afterwards owned unto one to whom I have the Honour to be related, <HI>That he had overdone.</HI> Those Things that are called, <HI>Fearful sights and
<PB N="8" REF="001763_0009_0FB7CD969CE6ED00"/>great signs from Heaven;</HI> There is a <HI>shaking</HI> of Heaven in them. We read, Mat. XXIV. 29. <HI>Stars shall fall from Heaven, &amp; the Powers of the Heavens shall be shaken.</HI> When <HI>Blazing Stars,</HI> do in their Elliptic Motions make their Descents towards us, &amp; threaten a Mis∣chievous Brush unto us, then do <HI>Stars fall from Heaven.</HI> But then, most properly, then most awfully, are the <HI>Powers of the Heavens shaken;</HI> when the Angels of the <HI>Heavens</HI> are put upon doing unusual Things among us. The <HI>Heavenly Powers</HI> may go so far out of the common Road, as to break in upon us, and <HI>Visibly,</HI> or <HI>Audibly,</HI> and <HI>Sensibly</HI> do Strange Things among the Children of Men; There is a wonderful <HI>shaking</HI> of <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> in such Things. It <HI>shakes Heaven,</HI> when the <HI>Angels</HI> do come out of <HI>Heaven,</HI> with Ap∣paritions, or with Operations, whereat Flesh and Blood falls into a consternation. <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> is then <HI>shaken;</HI> when the <HI>Heavenly Host</HI> is upon such <HI>Motions</HI> as cause just A∣mazement; and perhaps the <HI>Tongues of Men</HI> become the <HI>Tongues of Angels.</HI> — It be∣comes me to stop here; and Step into <HI>Lower Regions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001763_0010_0FB7CD9A1EBCC640"/>
The <HI>Earth</HI> is to be <HI>Shaken</HI> too. 'Tis very particularly so, when what we call an <HI>Earth quake</HI> happens. Our Lord <HI>shakes the Earth,</HI> when He causes the <HI>Upper layes</HI> thereof to <HI>Quake,</HI> by the Subterraneous Fires getting Head beneath 'em. In an <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> there comes to pass that, whereof we read; Job IX. 6 <HI>He shakes the earth out of her place, &amp; the pillars thereof do tremble.</HI></P>
<P>Thus again the Lord <HI>shook the Earth</HI> at the Giving of the Law; when the <HI>whole Mountain Quaked greatly.</HI> The Songs a∣mong the People of God many Ages after, celebrated that <HI>Earth-quake;</HI> They Sang, <HI>O God, The Earth trembled &amp; shook.</HI> Of all the Plagues inflicted by God upon a Pol∣luted World, that of an <HI>Earth-quake</HI> is the most formidable. It may seem admirable, that it is not Enumerated among the <HI>Plagues</HI> in <HI>Deuteronomy.</HI> Some think, 'Tis because the Lord has more peculiarly reserved this <HI>transcendent Judgment</HI> for the Times and the Crimes under the <HI>New Testament.</HI> And yet in the <HI>Old Testament</HI> also we find it Exem∣plified. Very singularly notable was that
<PB N="10" REF="001763_0011_0FB7CD9B9FB8D1B0"/>whereof the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> [I say, the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> because I take the Six last Chapters of what we have in the Book of <HI>Zechariahs</HI> Prophecies, to have been in∣deed <HI>Jeremiahs:</HI>] takes notice, in Zech. XIV. 5. <HI>Ye fled from before the Earth-quake, in the Dayes of Uzziah, King of Judah.</HI> The Jewish Historian relates, That this roaring <HI>Earth quake</HI> tore down an High Hill, which rolling for diverse furlongs did no little Da∣mage to the Kings Palace and Garden, and the roof of the Temple Split open so that the Sun shone into it. Be sure; The <HI>Earth-quakes</HI> which accompanied the <HI>Crucifixion</HI> and the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our Blessed JESUS, deserve an Eternal Commemoration: The Modern Travellers, who are far from Fancies and Whimsies, and at the same time of the most unspotted Veracity, do on the <HI>Split Rocks</HI> thereabouts at this very day, find a very probable Commemoration of it. 'Tis notorious, That the <HI>Sea,</HI> as well as the <HI>Dry Land,</HI> bears a Part when an <HI>Earth-quake</HI> is in its Agitations. A <HI>Troubled Sea</HI> is then perceived at a distance from the Shore; and
<PB N="11" REF="001763_0012_0FB7CDA04C7A07E0"/>near the Shore the <HI>Sea</HI> so retires, that the Channels <HI>of the waters are seen,</HI> and what no Eye ever saw before, is <HI>discovered.</HI> When God <HI>shakes the Sea &amp; the dry Land,</HI> the <HI>Sea</HI> withdrawes, and the <HI>Dry Land,</HI> which it once covered, is for a while Exposed. Every body knows these Things, I shall say no more about them.</P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Political World;</HI> there are Times wherein <HI>Shakes</HI> are given to <HI>That</HI> also; The terrified <HI>Nations</HI> feel <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> if you take them Figuratively, most wonderfully <HI>Shaking</HI> about them. God <HI>shakes all Nations;</HI> and He <HI>shakes Heaven and Earth</HI> in doing so. According to the Language of the Orient, by <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> are meant <HI>Superiors</HI> and <HI>Inferiors</HI> among the People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Shaking</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> What is this? Truly, Any Great Alteration in a <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> may be counted so. <HI>Kings</HI> are called <HI>Suns. Rulers</HI> under them are called <HI>Stars.</HI> When Suns or Stars are Extinguished, and put out and pull'd down, and laid in the Dust; when God <HI>Covers the Sun with
<PB N="12" REF="001763_0013_0FB7CDA4C69E07E0"/>Blackness, &amp; makes the Stars dark, &amp; brings darkness upon the Land,</HI> as it was denounced of old unto the Land of <HI>Egypt;</HI> Surely, <HI>Heaven</HI> cannot but be <HI>shaken</HI> in it. Especi∣ally, when such surprizing <HI>Mutations</HI> fall out, that Men who are the most Faithful <HI>Witnesses</HI> of our Saviour, shall <HI>hear a great Voice from Heaven, Come up hither;</HI> and shall put off their <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> and be advanced into Authority, and have power over the <HI>Nati∣ons;</HI> the <HI>Heaven</HI> of those <HI>Nations</HI> must be shaken with a <HI>Witness,</HI> in those Works of God. Astonishing <HI>Mutations</HI> came upon the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> when a <HI>New Set</HI> of Men, and a <HI>Good Set,</HI> had the management of it thrown into their Hands; And it is thus painted out; Rev. VI. 12, 13. <HI>Lo, There was a Great Earth-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake; and the Stars of Heaven fell <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Earth, and the Heaven departed as a scroll, when it is rolled together.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Church-State</HI> of any <HI>Nations,</HI> or People, is peculiarly the <HI>Heaven</HI> of that Peo∣ple. A Settling of <HI>Churches</HI> is called, a Planting of <HI>Heavens.</HI> The <HI>Pastors</HI> of Churches are called, The <HI>Stars</HI> of them.
<PB N="13" REF="001763_0014_0FB7CDAC99CA2C40"/>When Faithful Ministers are silenced, it is expressed so; Dan. VIII. 10. <HI>A casting down of the Stars from the Host of Heaven, and a stamping on them.</HI> The <HI>Changing</HI> of a <HI>Church-state,</HI> is a <HI>shaking</HI> of <HI>Heaven.</HI> When the <HI>Religion</HI> of a People is assaulted, their <HI>Heaven</HI> is then <HI>shaken:</HI> And if it be the <HI>Religion of God,</HI> in that <HI>shaking</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> there are <HI>Dragons</HI> who try with their Stings, to annoy the <HI>Stars of Heaven.</HI> Or, Sup∣pose it a <HI>False Religion;</HI> The Abolition of <HI>Judaism,</HI> of <HI>Paganism,</HI> of <HI>Popery,</HI> has always been with a Mighty <HI>shake of Heaven,</HI> in the Country, where the <HI>False Religion</HI> has been abolished. Verily, To dissolve a <HI>Church-state,</HI> and bring a New Face upon a <HI>Church by Law Established,</HI> or to lay aside Consti∣tutions of Consequence to a <HI>Church-state;</HI> This is to <HI>shake Heaven</HI> over the Heads of the People concerned in it. The <HI>Gospel,</HI> is Eminently the <HI>Firmament of Heaven</HI> spread over the Church of God. Where the <HI>Gospel</HI> comes to be brought in, and set up, and spread out, as the Rule of all Admini∣strations in the <HI>Church;</HI> Tis done with a
<PB N="14" REF="001763_0015_0FB7CDAF9180A6E0"/><HI>shaking of Heaven</HI> over the Heads of the People there.</P>
<P>And may not the <HI>Earth</HI> be <HI>shaken</HI> too! It may be so. Then is the <HI>Earth shaken,</HI> when there are <HI>great Stirs</HI> among the Common People. Sore Distresses among a People have this Description given of them; Isa. XXIV. 19, 20. <HI>The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly; The earth reels to &amp; fro like a Drunkard, &amp; is removed like a Cottage.</HI> Tumults, &amp; Ferments and Uproars among a People, are a Shaking of the Earth, as well as the <HI>Roaring of the Sea,</HI> in the Prophetic Schemes of speaking. We Read of such Things as those; Luk. XXI. 25. <HI>Upon the earth distress of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring.</HI> Sometimes, there are violent <HI>Commotions</HI> among the People. There are Tendencies to quite <HI>another Condition</HI> of Things; It may be said, <HI>The Nations are Angry;</HI> The Factions, the Clashes, the Clamours, are full of Menaces. Now the <HI>Waters roar and are troubled, &amp; the Mountains do shake</HI> (the
<PB N="15" REF="001763_0016_0FB7CDB0D62B3F48"/>Great Ministers are frighted) <HI>with the swelling thereof.</HI> So does God <HI>shake the Earth;</HI> and the <HI>Sea,</HI> as well as the <HI>Dry Land,</HI> has a deep share in the Convulsions upon the <HI>Nations.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>Deaths</HI> and <HI>Wars</HI> are Two ve∣ry considerable Strokes, whereby the Great God gives very considerable <HI>Shakes</HI> unto the Nations.</P>
<P>The Deaths of <HI>Chief Men</HI> give a Shake to the State which those Great Men Sup∣ported. The Fall of <HI>Pillars</HI> makes the House to <HI>shake,</HI> at the Supports leaving of it. And no <HI>Pillars</HI> do stand so firm, that the Mighty One, before whom every <HI>Samp∣son</HI> is less than a <HI>Moth,</HI> cannot throw them down. The World Shakes, when He throws them down. When a King died, and it was cryed out, <HI>How is the Mighty fallen?</HI> It was then said, Psal. LX. 2. <HI>Thou haft made the Earth to tremble.</HI> Sometimes <HI>One Life</HI> has upon it, Inexpressible Depen∣dencies! The frail Thread of <HI>One Life,</HI> the Affairs of whole <HI>Nations,</HI> depend upon it. The Prince Dies; <HI>His Breath goes forth;
<PB N="16" REF="001763_0017_0FB7CDB25D888430"/>he returns to his Earth; In that very day his thoughts perish:</HI> And in that very Day, what a Shake is given to many <HI>Nations!</HI> — O Memorable Month of ANGUST, How marvellous thy Demonstrations of it! How marvellous thy Demonstrations of it!</P>
<P>But, if <HI>Wars</HI> arise, — then the <HI>Nations</HI> are yet more dreadfully Shaken, and in the Shaking they are dashed One against ano∣ther. It <HI>shakes</HI> the World, when Things are at that sad pass: Mat. XXIV. 6, 7. <HI>Ye shall hear of Wars, &amp; Rumours of Wars, Na∣tion shall rise against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom.</HI> It is very suitably added, <HI>There shall be Earthquakes in divers places.</HI> Especially, If <HI>Civil Wars</HI> arise among a Peo∣ple, and God sets <HI>Aegyptians</HI> against <HI>Aegyp∣tians,</HI> and they <HI>fight every one against his Brother and against his Neighbour,</HI> such a People is horribly <HI>shaken</HI> in their Divisions. It is foretold; Hag. II. 21, 22. <HI>I will shake the Heavens and the Earth; and I will over∣throw the Throne of Kingdoms, and they shall come down every one by the Sword of his Bro∣ther.</HI> When there were diverse Competitors
<PB N="17" REF="001763_0018_0FB7CDB3E11DD820"/>for the Crown of <HI>Israel,</HI> we read; <HI>The Earth trembled.</HI> Such Competitions bring on Shakes, the Issues whereof are such as no Man alive could have imagined. But in∣deed all <HI>Wars</HI> are a <HI>Shaking</HI> and <HI>Sifting</HI> sort of Things, unto the Nations that are in∣volved in them. <HI>Nations</HI> are Shaken, when <HI>Swards</HI> are Furbished, when <HI>Swards</HI> are Bran∣dished; They are a <HI>Troubled Sea,</HI> when there is <HI>no Peace</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The <HI>Angels</HI> of our Glorious LORD, even His <HI>Mighty Angels,</HI> are con∣siderable, tho' invisible Instruments, in the Mighty <HI>Shakes</HI> which He gives unto the Na∣tions. The Shakes that are given to the World, are so many Turns, given to the <HI>Wheels,</HI> that carry on what is a doing in the World. We are hastening to a <HI>Kingdom that cannot be moved;</HI> But as yet we are in a World, in all Parts whereof, [all the <HI>Four</HI> Parts!] The <HI>Wheels</HI> are <HI>moving</HI> and <HI>shaking</HI> perpetually. And we find; Ezek. X. 9. <HI>The Wheels are by the Cherubims.</HI> One says well, <HI>The Angels are capacious Wheels, that move in the great Clock of the World.</HI> The <HI>Wheels</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="001763_0019_0FB7CDB550992158"/>of Providence, that Shake the World, and Change it Marvellously are very much ma∣naged by the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the <HI>Angels,</HI> whom God hath made <HI>Ministring Spirits,</HI> to wait about the Throne of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. When a Great King, the Ra∣vager on the Liberties of the World, was Dethroned, it gave a <HI>Great Shake</HI> unto the World. But how was it brought about? We read; Dan. IV. 23. <HI>A Watcher, and an Holy One, comes down from Heaven, and sayes, Hew the Tree down, and destroy it.</HI> Was it not the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> that help'd <HI>Alexander</HI> in Shaking the World, until it was turn'd upside down! I am sure, he said, <HI>He would,</HI> no less than Two Hundred Years before it was done. The Descent of Angels, uses to make all <HI>Tremble</HI> where they come. The <HI>Trembling</HI> of the World is very much owing to this; The Angels Descend; and they Shake Nations, and Shake Kingdoms, and Shake Empires, and set all a-shaking before the Lord.</P>
<P>It is by a <HI>Secret Work</HI> of the Glorious LORD on the <HI>Spirits</HI> of Men, that <HI>shakes</HI> are
<PB N="19" REF="001763_0020_0FB7CDB6CD7FB810"/>given, and wondrous Turns brought upon the World. Our LORD secretly disposes the <HI>Spirits</HI> of Men, to push on Amazing Changes in the Nations. Nations are strong∣ly and strangely <HI>Spirited,</HI> sometimes one way, sometimes another. The <HI>Spirit of a Nation</HI> is an Irresistible Thing.

When the <HI>Prayers of the Saints</HI> have been Offered, with the <HI>Incense</HI> of our Savi∣our at the Golden Altar, the Next News is, <HI>There are Thunderings and Lightni<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and an Earthquake;</HI> The Great G<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>shakes Heaven and Earth,</HI> with Horrend<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Con∣cussions upon it.

<P>There are certain MAXIMS directly calculated for the Grand Intentions of, <HI>Glory to God in the Highest,</HI> and, <HI>Peace on Earth from Good-will among men.</HI> Those MAXIMS,— to dig them out from that <HI>Mountain of God,</HI> our Sacred Scriptures, and run the Oar into <HI>Wedges of Gold;</HI> a more comprehensive Ser∣vice to the <HI>Church,</HI> and the whole <HI>World,</HI> cannot at this Day be thought upon.

<P>MAXIMS there are, wherein all the <HI>Chil∣dren of God</HI> are <HI>United,</HI> whatever <HI>Different Perswasions</HI> in other matters may alienate them from One another. MAXIMS they are, wherein all that are Cordially <HI>United,</HI>

<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>And now, O Christians, what should be our Behaviour at the <HI>Times,</HI> wherein we see our Glorious LORD so <HI>Shaking of the Na∣tions?</HI></P>
<P>I need not call upon you to look for <HI>Sha∣king
<PB N="29" REF="001763_0028_0FB7CDCC070B2190"/>Times:</HI> We see them, we feel them, we are in the midst of them; we shall shortly be more than ever so. The <HI>Things that cannot be shaken,</HI> but must be introduced, cannot be otherwise introduced.</P>
<P><HI>Earthquakes</HI> without a Metaphor will be Multiplied; More horrid than any of the past <HI>Sicilian</HI> or <HI>Italian</HI> ones. Even <HI>Geneva</HI> too has been very lately approached with them, and a whole Village newly Swallow∣ed up. Ominous Things they'l be! <HI>State∣quakes</HI> will become yet more Universal.</P>
<P>When our Lord was Leading forth His People from their <HI>Egyptian</HI> Captivities and Idolatries, there seems to have been an <HI>Earthquake</HI> assisting their Passage tho' the Divided Waters. We read, Psal. LXXVII. 18, 19. As if the <HI>Earth trembled &amp; shook,</HI> when the <HI>Way</HI> of God <HI>was in the Sea,</HI> and <HI>His Path in the great Waters.</HI> My Friends, Our Lord will certainly and speedily lead forth His People, from the midst of their worse than <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Entanglements. Par∣don me, that I tell you; I am verily per∣swaded, we are now at last entring into
<PB N="30" REF="001763_0029_0FB7CDD15936A2B8"/>an <HI>Earth quake</HI> that will give Assistance unto it.</P>
<P>This I am certain of, we are bidden to look for such a Thing as that; Rev. XVI. 18. <HI>A great Earthquake, such as has not been since men were upon the earth, so mighty an Earthquake, and so great an one.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but the Enquiry must be made; In <HI>such Times,</HI> how are we to behave our selves?</P>
<P>First. Let us make sure of having the Great GOD our Saviour, even our Lord JESUS CHRIST, for our <HI>Friend;</HI> under every <HI>Shaking</HI> His <HI>Friendship</HI> will be our <HI>Safety.</HI> In <HI>Shaking</HI> Times, <HI>Luther</HI> would say, <HI>Let us go Sing the Forty-sixth Psalm.</HI> If we are in the Favour of our Saviour, we may Sing that Psalm, Oh! How Comfor∣tably, Oh! How Triumphantly! What tho' the <HI>Earth be removed?</HI> We have the Lord of <HI>Heaven</HI> for our <HI>Friend,</HI> and we have <HI>Heaven</HI> to retreat unto. What tho' the <HI>Mountains fall?</HI> We have Him for our <HI>Friend,</HI> unto whom the Biggest <HI>Mountains</HI> are no more than the smallest <HI>Atoms;</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="001763_0030_0FB7CDD3B5738090"/>we shall our selves be like Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> that <HI>cannot be moved.</HI> What tho' the <HI>Sea</HI> roar, and swell, and rise, till it strike the very welkin? The <HI>Lord on High, is Mightier than the Noise of many Waters, than the Mighty waves of the Sea,</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is the <HI>Rock of Ages.</HI> There is no <HI>Shaking</HI> of that Eter∣nal <HI>Rock.</HI> Oh! Run to the <HI>Rock:</HI> Fly to the <HI>Rock!</HI> Become United unto our Saviour with a Lively <HI>Faith</HI> in him; and we are in a Felicity that Never, Never, Never can be <HI>shaken.</HI> He sayes to us, My Brethren, as <HI>David</HI> said unto <HI>Abiathar, With me thou shalt be in safety.</HI></P>
<P>Let us be strong Believers on. High Ad∣mirers of, our Lord JESUS CHRIST. The Men that are so, are the <HI>Favourites</HI> of the Lord: His <HI>Mark</HI> shall be on these His <HI>Fa∣vourites;</HI> No <HI>Shake</HI> of the World shall hurt those, that have that <HI>Mark</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>Secondly. Why should not <HI>Shaking Times</HI> be <HI>Praying Times? Prayer</HI> has before now made an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> We read, Act. XVI. 25, 26. <HI>At midnight Paul &amp; Silas prayed:
<PB N="32" REF="001763_0031_0FB7CDD4D5818228"/>And suddenly there was a great Earthquake, so that the Foundations of the Prison were shaken.</HI> Who knows, but that the true Disciples of our Lord may now see that <HI>Great Earth∣quake,</HI> which will <HI>Shake</HI> the very <HI>Foundations</HI> of all the <HI>Confinements</HI> unjustly put upon them: and ere long the <HI>Doors will be opened,</HI> and <HI>Every ones Bonds be loosed?</HI> Certainly in such an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and when whole <HI>Na∣tions</HI> are <HI>shaking,</HI> then <HI>Prayer</HI> will be a singu∣lar preservative. <HI>Prayer!</HI> Ah, why so much <HI>Slumber,</HI> and so little <HI>Prayer,</HI> when we have the World so <HI>shaking</HI> about us!</P>
<P>I have read of a Town in <HI>Switzer-land,</HI> once utterly ruined in an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> All except one piece of an House, in which a devout Man happened then to be at <HI>Prayer</HI> with his Family. The <HI>Decree</HI> of the Infinite GOD seems to be this; <HI>Yet once more, I will shake not the Earth only, but also Heaven.</HI> At such a Time there is that Voice from <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> to the <HI>Earth;</HI> Zeph. II. 2, 3. <HI>Before the Decree bring forth;</HI> — <HI>Seek ye the Lord, all ye Meek of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. When all Things are <HI>Shaking,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="001763_0032_0FB7CDD7106816A8"/>Let it be our Consolation, that it is our Glorious LORD, who does all that is done, and has all at His Dispose.</P>
<P>Who was it that said, <HI>I will shake the Hea∣vens &amp; the Earth, &amp; all Nations?</HI> Our A∣postle has expressly told us, It was the Lord JESUS CHRIST; Heb. XII. 26. <HI>Whose Voice shook the Earth,</HI> at Mount <HI>Sinai; but now He hath promised,</HI>—as you have heard.</P>
<P>When 'tis a Time for <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> and all <HI>Nations,</HI> to be so <HI>shaken,</HI> that <HI>Heaven &amp; Earth</HI> shall come together; Now, <HI>Let the Children of Zion be Joyful in their King!</HI> O <HI>Zion,</HI> Thy <HI>King,</HI> even the Glorious Head of the Church, and He that will not give <HI>Zion</HI> cause to say, <HI>My Lord has forgotten me:</HI> — 'Tis <HI>He</HI> that has the Ordering of all that comes to pass; And all shall be well-orde∣red. He <HI>will do all things well,</HI> — You may depend upon it! The Sentence which the Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> wrote upon his Ta∣ble; You may take it, and make it your Comfort, and Feed and Live upon it; <HI>If God be for us, who can be against us?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="001763_0033_0FB7CDD94A9EDB58"/>
What shall we say? <HI>O Lord, we know, that thou canst do every thing.</HI> The People of God, may need some <HI>Shakes</HI> to be given un∣to the World, for their Advantage; And such as can be given by none but an <HI>Arm</HI> that <HI>can do every thing.</HI> But such a <HI>Mighty Arm</HI> has our Saviour. You read, <HI>His Voice shook the Earth.</HI> It is the <HI>Voice</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, whom we are to see this Day upon a <HI>Threne High &amp; Lifted up,</HI>— His <HI>Voice</HI> that <HI>Shakes</HI> the World. If He do but <HI>Utter His Voice,</HI> or if He do but <HI>Speak the Word,</HI> there shall every thing be done, that His People can wish for. We read, <HI>The Kingdoms are moved,</HI> when He <HI>Utters His Voice,</HI> and the <HI>Earth Melts</HI> before it.</P>
<P>A Powerful <HI>Nimrod,</HI> that has made <HI>Na∣tions</HI> to <HI>shake</HI> with the Terror of his Arms: Our Lord JESUS CHRIST can easily <HI>shake</HI> such an one down into his Grave.</P>
<P>HE has newly done so. And I must conclude, with bespeaking of your due Re∣spect unto HIS Hand, in what has been done.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001763_0034_0FB7CDE07A7F4010"/>
¶ What has been spoken may be enough, to Introduce the REMARKS, which it may be our Duty and Wisdom to make, on the Mighty <HI>shake of the Nations,</HI> which is to be <HI>Observed,</HI> and <HI>Expected</HI> from the Fall of one, who has been as great a <HI>Troubler of the Na∣tions,</HI> as ever was in the World.—<HI>How art thou cut down to the Ground, which d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast wea∣ken the Nations!</HI>—</P>
<P>When the <HI>Grand Monarch</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> came to his end, the Spirit of God instructed his People, to make their Acclamations upon it; <HI>How has the Oppressor ceased! The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked. Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming: — Thy Pomp is brought down to the Grave. Thou saiast in thy Heart, I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God; I will sit in the sides of the North; I will be like the most High: yet thou shalt be brought down to the sides of the Pit. They that see thee shall nar∣rowly look upon thee, &amp; consider thee, saying, Is this the man, that made the Earth to trem∣ble, &amp; did shake the Kingdoms!</HI></P>
<P>We ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen the Direction of Heaven,
<PB N="36" REF="001763_0035_0FB7CDE2500983B8"/>as <HI>narrowly to look</HI> upon the fall of that <HI>Grand Monarch,</HI> who valued himself upon being the <HI>Eldest</HI> Son of the <HI>Romish Babylon;</HI> and <HI>con∣sider</HI> what our Glorious God would have us to <HI>learn,</HI> or to <HI>hope,</HI> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Occasion so great, and so greatly longed for.</P>
<P><HI>Far, far</HI> would we be from any indecent Insulting the Ashes of the <HI>Dead;</HI> tho' we may let fall some <HI>Terms of Justice</HI> to a <HI>Me∣mory,</HI> which the Word of God has in Ex∣press Terms damned unto a <HI>Putrefaction.</HI> The <HI>Tyrant,</HI> who took delight in offering inhumane Abuses unto the <HI>Dead</HI> Bodies of the Children of God, as well as to the <HI>Se∣pulchres</HI> of Princes, when, like those at <HI>Hei∣delbergh,</HI> they came in his way, shall be treated by us with more of <HI>Decency,</HI> than he has any claim unto.</P>
<P><HI>Decency!</HI> — But not such as will carry in it a Trespass on the <HI>Rules of Piety.</HI> It will be a Trespass upon <HI>them,</HI> to forbear calling him, <HI>A very wicked man,</HI> who was a thou∣sand Times worse than him, whom the Pro∣phet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> called, <HI>A prefane &amp; wicked Prince of Israel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="001763_0036_0FB7CDE3C81240F0"/>
There are <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Things,</HI> which all, that would pay a due Homage to <HI>Virtue,</HI> ought never to mention without some Expressions of <HI>Dissatisfaction</HI> at them. And the Histo∣rians, who relate the Actions of such <HI>Sata∣nick</HI> Wretches, as, for instance, the two Founders of the <HI>Graecian,</HI> &amp; <HI>Roman</HI> Empires, as if they were the Exploits of <HI>Heroes</HI> wor∣thy the Illustrious Title of <HI>Conquerors,</HI> and not rather as the Crimes of Ambitious, Ra∣pacious, Infamous <HI>Murderers;</HI> These pay a respect unto <HI>Vice,</HI> which ought not to be forgiven in them.</P>
<P><HI>Louis</HI> the XIV. stands the very <HI>first</HI> in the List of the Men, whose Actions will not have a just Account given of them in <HI>Histe∣ry,</HI> until the Day, wherein the <HI>Hay,</HI> and <HI>Stubble</HI> shall be consumed.</P>
<P>Nor shall I now make an Essay of a <HI>Satyr</HI> upon one, who has outdone all the Subjects of it, that ever were in the World; Yet allow me to say, <HI>With what Eyes do you think, the Holy Angels have look'd upon such a Man!</HI> Yet Allow me to say, <HI>What is it, that the Call, Rejoyce, O ye Heaven's, was made upon!</HI></P>

All that I Essay to do, is to employ the few <HI>Minutes,</HI> that are now left unto me in a few <HI>Glances</HI> on some Things, which we ought not to let the Hand of God, that has at length shaken down, a <HI>Tree</HI> of longer standing, and more baneful Influences, than that in the Visions of the <HI>Chaldean Emperor,</HI> to pass, without our taking some <HI>Usefull Notice</HI> of them.</P>

If it be enquired, as it was of old, <HI>Why one so unworthy of it, was placed upon such a Throne?</HI> As it was <HI>then,</HI> so it must <HI>now</HI> be answered, <HI>The Sins of the World made them worthy of such an one.</HI> Your <HI>Sins</HI> produced him, your <HI>Sins</HI> prospered him; your <HI>Sins</HI> kept him alive; and not the <HI>Prayers</HI> of Popish Idola∣ters for his Life; your <HI>Sins,</HI> which drowned the Voice of all the <HI>Prayers,</HI> which the best of Men sent up to Heaven against him.

<P>In the Conduct of the most <HI>Ungratefull</HI> among Men, there is a loud Voice from God unto the <HI>Protestant</HI> World; <HI>Cease ye from Man;</HI> and, <HI>Put not your trust in Princes!</HI> On the Birth of <HI>Louis</HI> XIV, the <HI>Protestants</HI> slattered themselves, that an <HI>Adeonatus,</HI> a gracious, and a wondrous <HI>Gift of Goa</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto them: they foolishly boasted,
<PB N="40" REF="001763_0039_0FB7CDEBC44C76C0"/>that their <HI>Prayers</HI> had obtained the Gift. Ah! Poor People! How terribly have you been convinced of your <HI>Delusion!</HI> From this Time, Away with your <HI>Vain Thoughts;</HI> and look for less from <HI>Vain Men,</HI> than you use to do!</P>
<P>The <HI>Pratestants</HI> were they, that set, and kept the <HI>Crown</HI> on the Head of this their Monarch; <HI>Notwithstanding</HI> this; yea, for this <HI>very Reason,</HI> [so <HI>Reason</HI> goes with such!] he set himself to destroy the <HI>Protestants.</HI> Never had the <HI>Protestants</HI> an Enemy, and a Destroyer like unto him! He was the <HI>first born</HI> of those Kings, who make the <HI>Times Pe∣rillous,</HI> because <HI>Men shall be Unthankfull,</HI> and set themselves to persecute, and extirpate, and overwhelm the People, to whom they are most of all endebted for the <HI>Thrones,</HI> which they are an <HI>eternal Disgrace</HI> unto. Do you not overhear your Inthroned Saviour calling to you; <HI>Your faithful Adherence to me would not be requited so!</HI></P>
<P>To secure a <HI>King</HI> on their side, as a Dead Weight against the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> the <HI>Protestants</HI> fell into rank <HI>Torism,</HI> and made

The <HI>Tyrant</HI> accepted their <HI>Offer;</HI> but added, he would have the Command of their <HI>Conscien∣ces</HI> too. And, <HI>Thank themselves,</HI> they could not then <HI>Help themselves.</HI> God from Hea∣ven in this Thing plainly calls unto you, <HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People, beware of Sinfull Compliances!</HI> And methinks, We have also a sufficient Warning against all <HI>Tory-Principles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How much Hurt one Man may do!</HI> How much <HI>Good one Sinner destroy!</HI> It will be found, there was very little of this <HI>whole World,</HI> but what one Way or other fared the worse for that <HI>One Man,</HI> who is now <HI>Dead, &amp; all his Malice dead with him.— Mor∣tui non Mordent.</HI> They that have made their calculations upon, <HI>The Desolation of France demonstrated,</HI> or have seen something of the Miseries in which <HI>Life is endured,</HI> by the Subjects there; know a little what his <HI>own Kingdom</HI> suffered from him.

A <HI>Constantine;</HI> a — A Day will come, when Mankind will be blessed with as <HI>General Benefactors.</HI> Roll on apace, <HI>O Golden Age;</HI> Why <HI>tarry the Wheels of thy Chariots!</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, <HI>O Christianity,</HI> How shamefully hast thou seen thy <HI>Name</HI> disho∣noured! The style of, <HI>Most Christian,</HI> ar∣rogated by the Greatest <HI>Adversary</HI> of a Glo∣rious <HI>Christ,</HI> and of real <HI>Christianity,</HI> that ever was in the World! One, whose <HI>De∣baucheries</HI> have been in the most Publick Manner avowed by him; and yet, <HI>Most Christian!</HI> One, who broke his <HI>Faith</HI> in more frequent and flagrant Instances, than ever any Prince among the worst of <HI>Infidels;</HI> and yet, <HI>Most Christian!</HI> One, who had the Guilt of more <HI>Blood</HI> lying upon him, than ever any Man, that breathed upon the Face of the Earth; and yet, <HI>Most Christian!

<P>Such a <HI>Murderer</HI> not only to be called, <HI>Most Christian,</HI> but also to accept the Title of, <HI>The King of Glory!</HI> when it was with a most shocking <HI>Blasphemy</HI> given unto him.</P>
<P>When shall we see the Rescue of that <HI>Worthy Name</HI> from such gross Misapplica∣tions!

<P>To see such a Man descend, <HI>Sicca Morte!</HI> — A <HI>Man</HI> of such <HI>Inhumanities,</HI> and of so Vicious a Character, yet shining to a <HI>great Old Age,</HI> in all the Grandeurs of Empire!

<PB N="44" REF="001763_0043_0FB7CDF9562AE958"/>Nation, which had most humbled him, suddenly restored into a condition to give <HI>Law</HI> unto the <HI>whole World,</HI> and put into the Possession of a <HI>greater Empire, &amp; Reve∣nue,</HI> than ever the Old <HI>Assyrian</HI> pretended unto!

<P>These Things would be <HI>Inexplicable,</HI> if there were not <HI>Another World;</HI> and a Day to come, wherein <HI>God will Judge the World.</HI> This Thought sets all to Rights. In the Circumstances of the <HI>French King</HI> the Glori∣ous God <HI>invites</HI> us unto this Thought; <HI>compells</HI> us unto it. It is come to this, <HI>If there be a just God, there must be another World!</HI> A Voice goes forth from <HI>Varsailles,</HI> and, <HI>Lo a Mighty Voice,</HI> that reaches to the Ends of the Earth; <HI>Children of Men, There is another World; and a Judgment to come, which is to be trembled at!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="001763_0044_0FB7CDFB0B9DA9D0"/>
But what is now <HI>to be looked for!</HI> Upon the Demise of the old <HI>Babylonian</HI> Mo∣narch, the next Thing was, <HI>The whole Earth is at Rest, &amp; is quiet; they break forth into Singing.</HI> But it must not yet come to <HI>that,</HI> God will yet <HI>shake all Nations</HI> before it comes to <HI>that!</HI> However a <HI>Mighty Turn</HI> to the Disadvantage of the <HI>Antichristian In∣terest</HI> is now to be looked for.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greatest Persecuter,</HI> that ever the Church of God had in the World, is now called away by the Almighty JESUS, whom he has <HI>Persecuted.</HI> All the <HI>Teu Primitive Persecutious</HI> have been outdone by that, which the French <HI>Molech</HI> has carried on; <HI>out done</HI> in the vast <HI>Numbers;</HI> and in the horrible <HI>Successes;</HI> and in the barbarous <HI>Cruelties,</HI> of the Executions. It may be hoped, that the Miserable People, who are to this Day languishing under these unparal∣lell'd <HI>Persecutions,</HI> may see some Relaxati∣ons of them. <HI>He that Opened not the House of his Prisoners,</HI> is dragg'd into his <HI>Prison.</HI> We that have sent up thousands of ardent Prayers to Heaven for it, cannot but be
<PB N="46" REF="001763_0045_0FB7CDFC87534268"/>filled with the Praises of our God, when we shall hear proclaim'd <HI>Liberty to the Captives, &amp; the Opening of the Prison to them that are bound.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Persecuted Religion</HI> of our Saviour shall e'er long revive, and expand, and flourish; and they that have <HI>ragear</HI> a∣gainst it shall find, that they have <HI>Imagined a vain thing.</HI> —</P>
<P>This I am sure of; There is a Day co∣ming, when the <HI>Spirit of Persecution</HI> shall be <HI>shaken</HI> out of the Church; and all <HI>Parties</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> even the <HI>Uppermost,</HI> as well as the rest every where, shall be ashamed of it: <HI>Persecuting Laws,</HI> and <HI>Persecuting Tests,</HI> will be no more known in the World.</P>
<P>Such Flourishes as those with which the Great <HI>Austin,</HI> (for a Disposition to <HI>Oppress,</HI> will make a <HI>Wise</HI> Man talk and act like a <HI>Mad</HI> Man,) did in a contradiction to his <HI>Former</HI> and <HI>Wiser</HI> Sentiments, defend the Persecution of the <HI>Donatists;</HI> the Read∣ing whereof was that which [horrible to be Spoken!] brought over the French Tyrant unto that infandous <HI>Persecution,</HI> which yet, we may hope, will issue no worse than <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣clestans!</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="001763_0046_0FB7CDFE06B9BDA0"/>— I say, such fallacious Colours and such bewitching ones, will ere long lose their efficacy, and the <HI>Party</HI> that shall be <HI>Uppermost,</HI> will no more be under the power of the <HI>strong Delusion.</HI></P>
<P>It has been Frequently, and very Pub∣lickly, &amp; with great Assurance foretold unto you, That all the Attempts from the House of <HI>Bourbou,</HI> as well as those from the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> in grasping after the <HI>Universal Monareby</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> shall come to nothing; A <HI>Blast</HI> from God upon them shall defeat them, shall confound them wonderfully. The <HI>boundless Ambition of France</HI> made very strong Efforts towards that <HI>Universal Mo∣narchy;</HI> but how remarkably have they been blasted of God? Several Times the late King has had an Opportunity in his hands to have seized upon it. But by an Amazing <HI>Infatuation</HI> from God upon him, he slipt his Opportunity. And now his <HI>Mortality,</HI> and God beginning the <HI>Vintage</HI> of his Vengeance on the <HI>Antichristian</HI> In∣terest, with <HI>cutting off the Spirits of the Prin∣ces</HI> in his Family, gives a <HI>Mortal Blew</HI> to all such Expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="001763_0047_0FB7CE04F05CE3D0"/>
Instead thereof, it has been long since fore∣told, that there shall be a <HI>Great Earthquake,</HI> wherein the <HI>Tenth Part</HI> of the Papacy <HI>shall fall;</HI> and the Tremendous, and Stupendous <HI>Earthquake</HI> shall issue in wondrous <HI>Glory to the God of Heaven. France</HI> was in time the <HI>Tenth, &amp; Last</HI> of those <HI>Ten Kingdoms,</HI> which have composed the <HI>Great City</HI> of the <HI>Mystical Babylon.</HI> Who can tell but now may be the time for that <HI>Great Earthquake,</HI> which will be followed with the Changes, that are to be hastned upon all the <HI>Ten Kingdoms;</HI> and the <HI>Vials</HI> of the Wrath of the Almighty to be poured out upon all the Antichristian Inte∣rest! <HI>God grant it may be so!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Deliverances</HI> of the <HI>British</HI> Nation, and of the whole Protestant Interest, and, O <HI>New-England,</HI> thy Deliverances too, how much are they the <HI>Immediate Work</HI> of God! — Brought about by the <HI>Immediate Hand</HI> of God!—Brought about in the most <HI>Cri∣tical Moments,</HI> that could have been imagi∣ned — <HI>The Enemy said, my Lust shall be sa∣tisfied upon them O our God, Thou didst then stretch out Thy Right Hand; the Earth swal∣lowed them!</HI></P>

<P>This I will say unto you; Doubtless there has now been seen the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Darkness</HI> in the most horrid Exhibition of it, that ever was in the World; because the most Glori∣ous <HI>Reverse</HI> of it is going e'er long to be Ex∣hibited <HI>But how Long, O Lord, Holy &amp; True!</HI>—</P>
<P>However I hope no <HI>Wise, &amp; Good</HI> Man will count it <HI>Ill Manners</HI> in us, to fulfil that Word this Day, Prov.
