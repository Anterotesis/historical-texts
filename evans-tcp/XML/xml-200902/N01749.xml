and so are justifyed and made heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven; and this change is made <HI>at once</HI> in the Soul; it is wrought in the twinkleing of an eye. There is wont ordinari∣ly to be a great deal of time spent in way of <HI>Preparation</HI> for this change: In order to this change there is wont to be a work of <HI>Contri∣tion</HI> and <HI>Humiliation;</HI> and tho' in the primi∣tive times we read of men passing thro' the work in a very little time, yet ordinarily we find that much time is consumed in the work of Preparation: There be many temptations to be overcome, flatteries and discouragements to be removed; men lose a great deal of time by falling into slumbers, by backwardness to reform some evils, by trying to establish their own righteousness, by fearing that they are not elected, or that God has given them up to hardness of heart, by imagining their hearts to be better than they be, by unwillingness to own the Justice and Sovereignty of God, so that commonly several months are spent, and sometimes some years, before they get thro' the work of Preparation; yet Conversion it self is wrought at once, in the hearing of one passage in a Sermon, by the remembring of one Scripture. As it will be in the Resur∣rection, 1 Cor. 15:52. <HI>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed:</HI> So it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this first Resurrection.

is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</HI> For the clearing of this, Consider▪</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>Preparatory Work</HI> is no part of Conversion. It is an Antecedent to Conver∣sion, but no part of Conversion. Sometimes under the work of Preparation, persons are so exact in their Conversation, have such affecti∣ons and Comforts that not only others, but themselves also think that they are convert∣ed; they have very great resemblances of Grace, they have many meltings of heart, de∣light in Sabbaths, zeal against Sin, as do car∣ry a great appearance of a gracious Spirit; but all that they attain unto is no part of the work of Conversion, they remain still in a natural Condition, and their religious affections are but counterfeit Graces. <HI>Paul</HI> seemed to himself as if he was <HI>alive,</HI> but af∣terwards he found himself <HI>to be dead,</HI> Rom. 7.9. <HI>I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, Sin revived and I died.</HI> Men under the work of Preparation are under the dominion and government of Sin, their corruptions are stunded but not mortifyed, they are restrained but not killed, they are like Vermin in the Winter, stupifyed but not dead; and whatever shew they make, they are destitute of Holiness, in all their affections there is no love to God, in all their lamenta∣tions for Sin there is no Godly Sorrow; their
<PB N="4" REF="002072_0005_0FBB7A841831B9C0"/>
religion proceeds only from Natural Consci∣ence and Self-Love: The men are afraid of Hell, that makes them walk orderly, resist Temptations and be sorrowful for Sin; they hope that God is not so angry as he was, that makes them forward in duties of religion; they consider the moral evil of many sinful practices, and that begets some kind of loath∣ing of them; they hope in such and such ways to win the favour of God, that makes them forward in duties of Religion and charity; they hope sometimes that God has pardoned them, that makes them have strong affections; but all these things are no part of Conversion: it may be said to them as Christ said to the <HI>Jews,</HI> Joh. 15.42. <HI>You have not the love of God in you.</HI> There is not one spark of Grace in them: Grace and Holiness is quite of ano∣ther kind: When they have gone thro' <HI>Pre∣paration</HI> Work, Conversion remains wholly to be wrought.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the Soul has performed <HI>one holy Action it is converted.</HI> One holy Action may be performed in the twinkling of an eye: An Act of Faith in Jesus Christ is done at once: And when the Soul has performed one holy Action it is converted: If one holy Action he Performed, there is a principle of Grace in the heart, there is a spirit of Love and Faith and Humility; and such a person is in an estate of Justification. There is a very great diffe∣rence between <HI>Morality</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> on this ac∣count.
<PB N="5" REF="002072_0006_0FBB7A8594CCA948"/>
A man may carry temperately, chast∣ly or justly, a day or two, yet not be a tempe∣rate, chaste or just man: but if he carries ho∣lily one day, or one minute, he is an holy man. If he performs one act of Faith, he is a Believer; if he perform one act of hu∣mility, he is a humble man. One act of Grace is an evidence that the mans heart is chan∣ged, and that he hath a principle of Grace: Men become morally temperate and chaste by degrees, but they are not made Converts by degrees. The least degree of Grace makes a man a Convert, or a Saint. Conversion may increase by degrees, men grow more and more holy by degrees, but Conversion is wrought at once; the first act of Grace makes a man a Convert.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every man is <HI>under the Dominion of Sin,</HI> or <HI>delivered from the Dominion of Sin.</HI> Those that are not converted, are under the dominion of Sin, enemies to God, spiritually dead; but they that are converted, are delivered from the dominion of Sin, subject to God, and spiritu∣ally alive; therefore Conversion must be in the twinkling of an eye: If there were any considerable time wherein this work were a doing, then at that time the man would nei∣ther be under the dominion of Sin, nor delive∣red from the dominion of Sin; there would be a considerable time wherein he would be neither dead nor alive, and so neither in an estate of Condemnation nor Justification:
<PB N="6" REF="002072_0007_0FBB7A87013989A0"/>
But surely, the next moment after his being freed from the dominion of Sin, he is subject to God. The same moment wherein he is de∣livered from Sin, he is an holy man.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> That Grace given in Saving Conversion differs in Kind from all that went before.</HEAD>
<P>SOme have been of opinion that <HI>saving Grace</HI> and <HI>common Grace</HI> differ only in <HI>de∣gree,</HI> that Sorrow for Sin increases till it becomes saving, and Love to God increases till it becomes saving: But certainly, saving Grace doth differ <HI>specifically</HI> from all that went before: <HI>Gracious Actions</HI> are of another nature than <HI>Religious Actions</HI> of natural men. The acts of common Grace may be very strong and powerful: The <HI>affections</HI> of the Children of Israel were very strong when they <HI>sang God's praise,</HI> Psal. 106.12. The <HI>affections</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Christ were very strong, when they cryed, <HI>Hosanna to the son of David:</HI> The affections of the <HI>Galations</HI> were strong, when <HI>if it had been possible they would have plucked out their eyes, and have given them to Paul:</HI> And sometimes the acts of saving Grace are very weak; there may be Godly Sorrow in a low degree; there may be an act of Faith
<PB REF="002072_0008_0FBB7A88A499ACB8"/>
with a great mixture of Unbelief; there may be true love to God where there is but little love to him: Grace is low and weak at first, yea, after thirty years growth it is exceeding defective: Indeed true love to God prizes God above all the world, but that doth not prove that it is in a great degree; there may be a spirit to prize God before all the world, yet but a small degree of that spirit. Innor∣dinate love to the world is an affecting of that as the chief Good; when it is in the low∣est degree, it is so; that is the nature of it. So love to God whether in a greater degree or a less degree, is an affection to God as the chief Good: The difference between saving and common Grace don't lie in the <HI>degree,</HI> but in the <HI>nature</HI> of them. This may appear,</P>
<P N="1">1. Because saving Grace acts From <HI>other Motives</HI> and for <HI>another End</HI> than common Grace doth. The difference in motives and end, makes a spiritual difference in actions: If men do not act from gracious motives and for gracious ends, they do not the thing that God commands; there is no obedience to God in what they do; they don't attend the will of God: When men <HI>depend on Christ</HI> to save them, from the incouragement of their own goodness, and meerly that they may be deli∣vered from Hell, they act quite after another manner than the man doth that depends on Christ only from the encouragement of his
<PB N="8" REF="002072_0009_0FBB7A8E6A4E3728"/>
Excellency, and that he may be delivered from Sin as well as from Damnation: When a man <HI>mourns for Sin</HI> because it exposes him to con∣tempt among men, or wrath from God, or be∣cause of the moral evil of it, he doth quite another thing from that man, who mourns for it because it is a wrong to a God of infinite Glory: If his Sorrow were in the highest de∣gree that his nature is capable of, it would not be gracious.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the difference between saving Grace and common Grace lay in the degree, <HI>no man could judge that his Grace is saving,</HI> Men may know that they have saving Grace, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.13. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10. But if the difference lay in the degree, how should men go about to deter∣mine that their Grace was saving? The man may know that he has a greater degree of confidence, and sorrow, and zeal, than formerly he had; he may have reason to think that he goeth beyond some other Professors in these things; but upon what foundation can he determine that he hath them in such a degree as to secure Salvation? Where has God re∣vealed what degree is saving and what is not saving? What warrant has any man to judge himself in a safe condition, if there be several degress of Grace that are not saving? What Rule can any Minister lay down to guide men in this matter? Men must needs be left in a perpetual uncertainty, and remain in the dark about their eternal estate. If a man saw that
<PB N="9" REF="002072_0010_0FBB7A8FA7ACD470"/>
he believed in Christ, that he repented of his Sins, that he aimed at the Glory of God, it would be little comfort to him, because he could not tell that it was in such a <HI>degree</HI> as to secure his Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Grace that is given in Conversion is <HI>new.</HI> When a man is converted it's wholly new; when God converts a man he gives him a <HI>new heart,</HI> and puts a <HI>new spirit</HI> within him. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. He is a <HI>new creature;</HI> not in respect of his Soul or the Faculties of it▪ but in respect of the Inclinations of it. But if common and saving Grace differ only in de∣gree, then his Grace is not wholly new, for he has had religious Joys and Sorrows, and a Zeal a long while; before he had saving Grace he had the same inclinations and spirit, only now it is heightned and increased; some de∣grees are new, but the inclinations themselves are not new; so that Conversion wou'd be not the giving a new heart, but only an augment∣ing such inclinations as were there before.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is an <HI>opposition between saving Grace and common Grace:</HI> If one be opposite to the other, then they differ specifically: Those dispositions that have contratriety one to the other, that are at war one with the other, and would destroy one another, are not of the same kind; and truly these are so: Common Graces are Lusts, and do oppose saving Grace: Making his own Salvation his last end, is contrary to making the Glory of
<PB N="10" REF="002072_0011_0FBB7A90EC7852B8"/>
God his last end: Hating Sin, not because it wrongs God, but because it exposes him, is resisting the Command of God: Bringing eve∣ry thing into subserviency to his own ends, is opposite to the bringing every thing into a sub∣serviency to God's Glory: The man that has but common Grace goeth quite in ano∣ther path than that which God directs unto: When he goeth about to establish his own Righteousness, he sets himself against that way of Salvation God prescribes, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. There is an enmity in the ways of such men as have but common Grace, to the ways that godly men take.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Habitual and Actual Conversion are wrought together.</HEAD>
<P>THose holy <HI>Habits</HI> and Inclinations that God puts into the hearts of his People, are not visible in themselves; men cannot discern them but by their <HI>actings:</HI> As men are not able to see their own Souls, so they are not able to see those habits that are in them, but only by their actings: They have a power to reflect on the operations of their hearts, and so come to the knowledge of those habits that are in them; but they cannot see
<PB N="11" REF="002072_0012_0FBB7A9263C9A6D0"/>
those habits immediately: Hence no man is able upon his experience to tell the very mi∣nute when the habits of Grace were put into him: And generally men have thought that: the habits of Grace are put into men before their closing with Christ; and they have been wont to argue in that manner, that there must be holy principles before holy actions, there must be life before there be life acts: But there is no necessity of this; the faculty of acting, must be before the action, the cause must be before the effect; the man must have a being before he can have any operation; but it doth not follow from thence, that there must be a gracious habit before there be any gracious action: There is no necessity that there be an <HI>antecedent habit,</HI> it is suffici∣ent if there be a <HI>concomitant habit</HI> and inclina∣tion. There was no necessity that <HI>Jacob</HI> should have an habit of Love to <HI>Rachel</HI> before he actually loved her; that <HI>Michal</HI> should have an habit of loving <HI>David</HI> before she actually loved him; there was no necessity that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> should have an habitual inclination to Sin before they <HI>did sin:</HI> So, there is no necessity that men should have an inclination to believe in Christ and love God, before they do actually believe in Christ and love God; it is sufficient that there be a concomitant inclination that way: And thus it is from time to time; wherever there is an act of Faith and Love, there is a disposition to act
<PB N="12" REF="002072_0013_0FBB7A93DA3D0698"/>
so for the time to come; but there is no ne∣cessity in Nature that the inclination should be antecedent.</P>
<P>And this supposition of an antecedent gra∣cious inclination before actual Conversion, is attended with this insuparable difficulty; That a man may have gracious habits, and yet be in a state of condemnation; that he may have a sanctified heart, yet be for a time under the Curse; that his heart may be chan∣ged, and yet abide for a time under the Curse. That he may be sanctified yet not justified; for there is no Justification till there is actual Faith. When it is said in Scripture that we are justified by Faith, the meaning is not that we are justified by an habit of Faith, but actu∣al Faith; for that Faith is set forth by words signifying Action; by believing on Christ, receiving Christ, coming to Christ, opening to him: It is said of <HI>Abraham,</HI> he <HI>be∣lieved in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteousness,</HI> Gen. 15.6. The Condition of Justification must be wrought by us; thence it is actual Faith that is intended: A disposi∣tion to yield perfect obedience was not the fulfilling the Condition of the Covenant of Works; if that would have done, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> would have been justified us soon as they were made. So a disposition to believe is not a fulfilling the Condition of the Covenant of Grace; but actual believing.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002072_0014_0FBB7A954E10FF78"/>Moreover, it is evident that habitual and actual Conversion are together, because both of them are effected by the same divine act, <HI>viz.</HI> The discovery of the <HI>truth and glory of the Gospel.</HI> I am far from thinking that God is tied up unto this way; or that he cannot give the habits of Grace without such a dis∣covery; but it is evident from the Word of God that he doth work the habit of Grace, and draws forth the act of Grace in this way: That he doth give this principle &amp; gracious inclina∣tion in this way is plainly taught; 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Changing into the image of God is by giving the habits of Grace unto them; beholding the glory of God as in a Glass is the discerning the Glory of God in the Gospel. We are taught the same also in 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>I have begotten you through the Gospel.</HI> In Re∣generation men do receive the habits of Grace, the heart is renewed, and the man is made a new man; and this is wrought thro' the Gos∣pel, by the Gospel, as <HI>understood;</HI> for it is in this way and no other that the Gospel hath any gracious Efficacy on the heart: If a man hears the Gospel twenty years, and has not the spiritual understanding of it, it will have no gracious effect upon him; but he discovers what a glorious way of Salvation God has prepared, and that works a great change in his
<PB N="14" REF="002072_0015_0FBB7A96C8D4E8F8"/>
heart: The same is taught, Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth:</HI> that is, by the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which he calls the <HI>word of truth</HI> by way of excellency, and be∣cause the truth of it was questioned by the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>And by this discovery God draws forth the exercise of Faith at the same time; that discovery makes men immediately to receive the Gospel. When men have a spiritual sight of Christ, they will believe on him; if they withstood the calls before and objected, they will be prevailed on by that sight; Joh. 1.40. <HI>This is the will of him that sent me, that every one that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life.</HI> And v. 45. <HI>Every man that hath beard and learned of the Father co∣meth unto me.</HI></P>
<P>It is also impossible in Nature but that men when they do believe in Christ should have an inclination or disposition to come to him. Men may do some things out of a kind of compulsion, and do them upon some accidental, by consideration, and yet hate to do them at the same time: But the accepting of Christ is always an act of great freedom; when they do it, they do it out of choice: Psal. 110.3. <HI>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.</HI> They do it from conviction of the preciousness of Christ and benefit of coming to him; they love to come, and have a disposition to do so for the future.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="002072_0016_0FBB7A9F0C6D9460"/>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Believing in Christ is the first Act of Conversion.</HEAD>
<P>MEN that are converted do exercise all manner of Grace; They perform acts of Love, and Fear, and Submission, and godly Sorrow, and Patience, and Humility; but the first act of Conversion is to <HI>believe in Jesus Christ.</HI> There is no other gracious act that goeth before Faith. In <HI>this respect</HI> Conversion is wrought after the same manner in all that are converted: After the first act of Grace there is no certain order in the exercise of Graces, but this act of believing in Christ has the preceeding in all. Some men don't make a beginning in Godliness in loving God, and others in sorrow for Sin, and others in patience, and others in humility; but they all begin by <HI>receiving Christ as offered in the Gospel:</HI> False Conversions begin some in one way and some in another, but saving Conver∣sion always begins with believing in Christ. The man did a great deal in Religion before he believed in Christ, but he had no true Love, nor godly Sorrow, nor Humility before: True Holiness takes its rise here, this is their en∣trance in at the strait gate: There is no sure sign of Election before this, therefore we
<PB N="16" REF="002072_0017_0FBB7AA0972DF1D8"/>
are advised to <HI>make our election</HI> sure by our <HI>calling,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. This is that which brings men into an estate of Justification: <HI>He that believeth on him hath everlasting Life,</HI> Joh. 3.36. Whatever went before gave the Man no title to Life Eternal: There is no need of Holiness to go before Faith: If there were need of Holiness before Faith, either it would be to encourage men to believe; but there is encouragement enough without that, the Grace of God offered in the Gospel and the Righteousness of Christ, are sufficient encou∣ragement, tho' men never did one good deed; for <HI>God just fieth the ungodly,</HI> Rom. 4.5. That is those who have lived an ungodly life 'till the very minute of their closing with Christ: Or else, if there were need of proceeding Holiness, it would be to incline the heart to come to Christ; but there must be some first act of Holiness, and there is no necessity of any proceeding Holiness to incline men to do the first act of Holiness. When God discovers Christ, that inclines the heart to come unto him. Besides, We may consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Sinners at their first coming to Christ, <HI>see nothing in themselves to incourage them to come.</HI> When Sinners come at first to Christ they are <HI>weary and heavy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Mat. 11.28. They are <HI>athirst,</HI> Rev. 22.17. They are convinced that their hearts are full of <HI>enmi∣ty to God▪</HI> That they are empty of good that they are <HI>wretched and miserable, and poor, and
<PB N="17" REF="002072_0018_0FBB7AA22C0A17F8"/>
blind, and naked,</HI> Rev. 3.17. Tho' formerly they thought themselves alive, yet they are convinced that they are dead: They take en∣couragement from <HI>Christ, and the Grace and Faithfulness of God;</HI> but they see no good in themselves to be an encouragement to them: Afterwards, godly men see somewhat in themselves that is an encouragement to them: they can say sometimes as <HI>David, I love the Lord,</HI> Psal. 116.1. And as <HI>Job, Thou knowest that I am not wicked,</HI> Job. 10.7. And tho' they depend on Christ and the Grace of God alone; yet it is an encouragement to them to see the Grace of the Spirit in themselves. But Sinners at their first coming to Christ, see nothing in themselves to be an encourage∣ment to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. That men are <HI>sanctifyed by faith.</HI> Act. 26.18. <HI>Sanctified by faith in me.</HI> Act. 15.9. <HI>Puri∣fying their hearts by faith.</HI> Their Love and Repentance are the fruit of Faith; and there∣fore no other holy carriages are antecedent to Faith. All that are Unbelievers are destitute of other Graces: If there be appearances of Repentance and Love to God's Glory, they are but delusions: If other gracious carriages depend on Faith, they do not preceed Faith; for the effect is not before the cause. If Faith have no being it can have no operation: If there were any Holiness that went before Faith, that Sanctification is not thro' Faith in Christ, then their hearts were purified without Faith.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="002072_0019_0FBB7AA3AF2778E0"/>3. The <HI>Gospel is the means of Conversion.</HI> It is by the Gospel that the hearts of men are made holy: 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>I have begotten you thro' the Gospel.</HI> The works of Creation and common Providence teach men to be holy, but don't make men holy: So the Law or <HI>Co∣venant of Works</HI> teacheth men that they should be holy, but that don't make men holy; but it is the <HI>Gospel</HI> that makes men holy: When <HI>Paul</HI> was sent to preach the Gospel, the de∣sign was to turn men from the power of Satan unto God; and if the Gospel be the instru∣ment of Conversion, men have no Holiness 'till they do receive the Gospel. So long as the offers of the Gospel are rejected or neglected, it can have no sanctifying efficacy on them: it may work some common affections, but it don't change their hearts. If men are not wrought upon by the Gospel to give enter∣tainment to Christ, it hath no other gracious effect on them. The first gracious effect of the Gospel is to make men come to Christ, other gracious effects are consequential to this.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> This Act of Faith doth include all other Graces.</HEAD>
<P>THE act of Faith in accepting Jesus Christ is the <HI>Conversion of the whole Soul unto God:</HI> for it is vertually all Grace, it in∣cludes in it somewhat of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of all other Graces: There is a distinction in the exercise of several Graces; there is a difference between the acts of Faith, and Love, and Repentance, and Humility; yet there is somewhat of the spirit of every Grace working in the Soul's first closing with Christ. As,</P>

He tells us, that he calls us, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he is appointed to be a Prince and a Saviour, that he died for our Sins, that he has satisfyed the Justice of God, that he is risen from the dead, and sits at the right hand of God, that he will of his free Grace pardon all the Sins of those that come to him; and the man when he comes to Christ receives the whole <HI>Doctrine of the Gospel</HI> as the <HI>true sayings of God:</HI> He rejects all carnal reasons, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> true,</HI> He made a Profession before, but now
<PB N="20" REF="002072_0021_0FBB7AA7479BA5A8"/>
he don't <HI>stagger at the promise of God through unbelief;</HI> he is satisfyed that <HI>the Gospel is no cunningly devised fable,</HI> but the very Word of God; 1 Thes. 2.13, <HI>Ye received the word not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe:</HI> They dont look upon it as pro∣bable as they did before, but have the assu∣rance of the truth of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is <HI>Love to God and Christ.</HI> When the Soul marries to Christ, he doth it with a spirit of Love; He takes God as his Por∣tion, he takes his satisfaction in God; he comes to God not for some Conveniency but for Blessedness, he takes him as one that is sufficient to make him happy; he despises all the world in comparison of God: He takes a complacency in God, and sees the gloriousness and amiableness of God: The love of God ap∣pearing in the Gospel draws his heart. He loves to <HI>depend on Jesus Christ,</HI> and to put <HI>honour upon him.</HI> This way of Salvation pleases him, he looks upon Christ excellent and glorious, he extols Christ: Cant. 5.11. <HI>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest of ten thousands.</HI> and v. 16. <HI>He is altogether lite∣ly.</HI> His coming to Christ is not a forced thing; but he esteems him <HI>fairer than the children of men,</HI> Psal. 45 2.</P>

and unprofitable; that there is ingratitude, injustice and impudence in it: If they consider such things a thousand times over, that will not mortify their corruptions; but it is God that doth it; and the way where∣in he doth it, is by <HI>infusing a principle of Grace</HI> into the heart. The infusion of Grace and the mortification of corruption, are at the same instant. Mortification of corruption don't follow after the infusion of Grace, but is contemporary with it. 2 Cor. 5.17. <HI>Old things are passed away, and all things are made new.</HI> These two works are done by the same operation. God don't put forth two operati∣ons, one to make men gracious, the other to kill their corruptions; but the same divine act has these two effects, to give new inclina∣tions, and destroy the old. God restrains the corruptions of men before he puts Grace into them; and takes away much of those evil habits that men had contracted by a Course of Sin: He doth that by terrifying the Con∣science, giving some common encouragements, and by humane restraints, &amp; education; but it is by giving Grace to the Soul that corrupti∣on is mortifyed. Corruption is not mortifyed before the infusion of Grace, neither is the infusion of Grace before mortification; but they are wrought at once by the same act.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. The same light that works gra∣cious inclinations, doth destroy Sin. The
<PB N="27" REF="002072_0028_0FBB7ABDDA8C5F18"/>
way wherein God communicates Grace is by teaching men how glorious he is. He lets in <HI>Gospel Light,</HI> and so works gracious inclina∣tions. Men see the <HI>reason</HI> why they should love God, trust in Christ, and be humble, and this inclines the heart that way. God deals with men as with rational creatures; he dis∣covers to them the <HI>Reason and Foundation</HI> of holy carriages, and so disposes the heart to them: 2 Cor. 4.18. <HI>We all beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image.</HI> He makes them know him∣self, and so makes them sincere. Psal. 36, 10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving kindness to them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</HI> He teaches them, and so they come to Christ: Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</HI> And it is the same way that he mortifies their corruption. This light weans them from the world, kills the pride of their hearts. This light makes them hate the ways of Sin. At the same time that they see reason to exalt God, they see the evil of pride. When they see reason to love God, they see that there is no reason to dote on the world, Act. 26.18. <HI>To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. Natural Corruption is nothing else but the privation of Holiness. Contracted habits have something positive in them, but natural corruption is only the privation of
<PB N="28" REF="002072_0029_0FBB7ABF49404940"/>
Holiness. When Man lost the image of God, there was nothing positive put into him. The condition of man by nature is, that he is destitute of Love, and Faith, and Humility; and thence he runs into evil, and is disposed to love the world, and set up himself above God. This shews that the very giving of Grace mortifies corruption. When the habit is given, the privation is expell'd. When light comes into the eye, the darkness is gone: When sight is given to men, blindness is ta∣ken away: When life came into <HI>Lazarus,</HI> he was delivered from Death: When love to God is put into the Soul, innordinate self-love is mortifyed. When Faith is wrought in the heart, Unbelief is mortifyed. When men are made humble, their Pride is morti∣fyed. When God conveys spiritual Life to men, without any more to do, they are deli∣vered from spiritual Death: Rom. 8.2. <HI>The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and of death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 3. Holiness doth imply in it a hatred to Sin. Where Sin is hated it is mortifyed; that was <HI>Paul's</HI> spirit, Rom. 7.15. <HI>What I hate, that I do.</HI> When Sin is hated, then the strength of it is abated. The strength of Sin lies in men's <HI>love</HI> to Sin. Wherever Sin is hated as the greatest evil it is mortified: As it loseth the love of men, so it loseth it's strength. That was a sign of <HI>David's</HI> morti∣fication, that he hated vain thoughts, <HI>Psal.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002072_0030_0FBB7AC0CFE78498"/>
119.113. And wherever there is Holiness there is an hatred of Sin. If the heart of a man be inclined to believe, he hates unbelief; unbelief is contrary to that inclination: So, if a man have an inclination to love God as his chief Good, he will hate the workings of pride and worldliness, the setting up any other thing above God. Sinful inclinations are enemies to Holiness, and holy inclinations are enemies to Sin. They have a tendency in themselves to destroy one another: Gal. 5.17. <HI>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary one to the other.</HI> There is a warfare between Grace and Corruption, they seek the destructi∣on of one another.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 4. The more degrees of Grace men get, the more Sin is mortifyed. The more men put on the new man, the more they put off the old man. Holiness and Mortification hold an exact proportion one to the other. As one Scale rises, the other falls: As water comes into the vessel, the air is expelled: The more light is in the air, the less darkness: 2 Sam. 3.1. <HI>David waxed stronger and stron∣ger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</HI> As Grace flourisheth, so Sin dies. Whenever there is any addition to Grace, there is a proportionable substraction from Corruption. The more humility, the less pride. They that are very humble, are not very proud. They that have a great deal of
<PB N="30" REF="002072_0031_0FBB7AC499A9AFD8"/>
Faith, have but little Unbelief. And when Grace shall be perfected, no Sin shall remain; the perfection of Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth expel all Sin. Where there is perfect light, there is no dark∣ness. 1 Joh. 15. <HI>God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</HI> Where there is perfect beauty, there is no blemish. Eph. 5.27. <HI>Not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy without blemish.</HI></P>

Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that have refused a long while do refuse no longer after God lets in this light: Act. 26.18. <HI>To open their eyes, to turn them from dark∣ness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all as with open face beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> All that are ignorant of God remain unconverted; all that know God are converted.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. Man's being capable to know God makes him capable to be holy. If man had not a reasonable Soul capable to know God, he could not be capable to be holy. The in∣feriour creatures tho' they have some know∣ledge and resemblances of Reason, yet are un∣capable of the knowledge of God, and ac∣cordingly are uncapable of holiness, and accor∣dingly are not under the direction of the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> But if God makes man capable to know him, he thereby makes him capable of holiness; the reason of it is, because if he actually <HI>knows God,</HI> he <HI>will be holy:</HI> The knowledge of God and holiness go together: Psal. 36.10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving kindness to them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</HI> God is so glorious, that if he be known, the heart will be drawn to him: Psal. 36.7. <HI>Because of the excellency

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f thy loving kindness, the children of men put their trust in the shadow of thy wings.</HI> The excellency of God draws the heart irresistably to him, when it is known. The knowledge of God is inseparable from holiness. All that know him are holy: The very capacity to know God, makes men capable to be holy, to love him and trust in him. The Angelical Nature is capable to know God, and so capa∣ble of holiness, and so the Humane Nature: And when men are renewed in the image of God, they are renewed in knowledge; Col. 3.10. <HI>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. Until men <HI>know God,</HI> no <HI>terror, or punishment, or perswasion, will make them holy.</HI> Many men have very strong perswasions set before them to induce them to be holy; the equity of it, the profit, the pleasure, and the honour of it, are amply demonstrated; such arguments as are wont mightily to prevail in other cases; yet the men are not gained, they make their hearts as adamants, and they will not be gained until they have the knowledge of God. If the perswasions do beget some de∣sires, if they do beget some resolutions, if they prevail on men to make some attempts; yet they don't make men holy: Men must be taught of God else they will not be holy. Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every man that hath heard and learn∣ed of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> Terrors of
<PB N="33" REF="002072_0034_0FBB7AC9043BC938"/>
conscience will not not make men holy. Men can't be frighted into the love of God. Men may be scared into <HI>Reformation,</HI> but not into <HI>Conversion.</HI> Trembling may take hold of hy∣pocrites, yet they remain hypocrites. <HI>Cain's</HI> terrors did not make him holy. <HI>Judas</HI> his terrors did not make him holy. Fear will make men hypocrites, but not Saints. Psal. 78.34. <HI>When he flew them, then they sought him,</HI> but, v. 36. <HI>They flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue.</HI> The <HI>fear of Hell</HI> will not make men hate sin more than hell: Punishments will not make men holy. Hell-fire will not purge away men's dross. One glimpse of the Glory of God, will do more than all the punishments in the world to make men holy. Cant. 1.4. <HI>Draw me and I will run after thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 3. The <HI>perfect Knowledge of God is accompanied with perfect Holiness.</HI> Holiness always holds a proportion to men's knowledge of the glory of God. They that have not the knowledge of the glory of God, hare not one spark of holiness; if they pretend to it, yet they are utterly destitute of it. Man may set up <HI>Altars</HI> to the <HI>unknown God,</HI> but they never love an unknown God.

the other. Every beam of light has heat in it. 2 Pet. 1.2. <HI>Grace and peace be multiplied un∣to you, through the knowledge of God and of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> And when the knowledge of God is perfect, holiness will be perfect. We can never comprehend God, nor search out the Almighty to perfection; yet the Grace of Knowledge may be perfect: And when men do enjoy the light of Glory, they will be as holy as they desire to be. Light and life will be perfected together. <HI>Heaven</HI> is a place of <HI>perfect Light,</HI> and <HI>perfect Holiness:</HI> Psal. 17.5. <HI>I shall behold his face in righteousness, I shall be satisfyed with thy likeness.</HI> 1 Joh. 3.2. <HI>We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 4. When <HI>men do see the Glory of God, they would act against their Nature if they should not be holy.</HI> Every creature will act it's nature, and so will Man. When men know things to be true, they will assent to them. When men see God, they know his testimony to be true: When men know the excellency of God, they must chuse him. The Glory of God is such, that it captivates the heart; where it is seen it has a magnetick power; it irresistably conquers the will. There is a necessity of loving God, when he is seen; if men should not, they would act against their nature. There is no power in the will to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist holiness when the Glory of God is seen. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is impossible in nature that men should

know God and not be holy. The Will always follows the last dictates of the Understanding. The Understanding is the guide of the Will; the will always follows its direction. Men would offer violence to their nature, if they should do otherwise. The <HI>excellency of God</HI> is a <HI>sufficient reason for men's loving and ser∣ving him:</HI> Because God has such excellency, it is man's duty to love and serve him; and it is their happiness to love and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve him: And when they know the excellency of God it will be their practice.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Men are capable to receive Light from the Spirit of God, before they have an habitual Change in their Understand∣ing.</HEAD>
<P>MAN in his natural estate is represented in Scripture as utterly depraved, <HI>dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> He is blind, and in darkness. And it may be thought that he is incapable to see the gloriousness of God, un∣til there be first an habitual change in his understanding; but if we examine the word of God, we may find plain intimations, that this light doth precede the habitual change.
<PB N="36" REF="002072_0037_0FBB7AD3869D5048"/>
Joh. 5.25. <HI>The time is coming, and now is' when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.</HI> Hear∣ing the voice of Christ is antecedent to their living: It is in that way that life enters into them. 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open face be∣holding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image:</HI> Before they are changed into Gods image, they do behold his Glory. This makes it evident, that men are capable to behold the glory of the Lord be∣fore the habitual change. God discovers his Glory, and that inclines him to assent and draws forth an actual assent. Which may be further considered by these considerations.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. Man <HI>in his corrupted estate has his natural faculty of understanding.</HI> He hath the faculty of understanding in his corrupted estate, and in his renewed estate. A godly man has not two faculties of understanding, one whereby he knows God, and another whereby he knows other things; but by the faculty of understanding he knows God and Christ, and the truth of promises, and likewise rules of art, the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the natural causes. Where there is a natural understanding, endued with literal knowledge, and assisted by the Spirit of God, there is a power to know God: In that case there is nothing wanting in order to the spiritual knowledge of God. Men need no other faculty in order to spiritual
<PB N="37" REF="002072_0038_0FBB7AD50BB75FD8"/>
knowledge provided it be <HI>duly inlightned▪</HI> To imagine that there needs any other lower is to fancy the need of another faculty, or a faculty in a faculty, in order to the know∣ledge of God; as if we understood the crea∣ture by one faculty, and God by another. A faculty of understanding instructed and assisted by the Spirit, must needs inable men to know God.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. An <HI>habitual change in the under∣standing, don't give men a power to know God.</HI> It must be acknowledged, that there is such a thing as an habitual change in the understand∣ing: Godly men have a sanctified mind; they have a principle put into them, that leads them to judge aright concerning God and Christ; and a principle of Faith to receive the testimony of God: But habits dont give men a power to know. We must carefully distinguish between a faculty of power and an habit: An habit is only an inclination to do a thing; an habit fits a man to do a thing with more facility and dexterity. Habits are not faculties; they don't enable men to do what they could not do before; they dispose and incline the heart that way. A natural man has a prevailing inclination to judge wrong concerning God, and an opposition to believe right concerning God; his mind is averse to the reception of those doctrines that the Scripture teaches concerning God; but yet he has the faculty or power to judge
<PB N="38" REF="002072_0039_0FBB7AD691FD3D68"/>
aright when he is assisted. And the godly man having received habitual light, has an inclination to judge aright of God and spiri∣tual things.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 3. This <HI>actual light which men receive from the Spirit of God, doth beget habitual light.</HI> It is in this case as in many others; a man that has had experience of the sweet∣ness of hony, is inclined thereby to judge so from time to time: He that has had experi∣ence of the saltness of the sea, is inclined to judge it so: And he that has understood the gloriousness of God, is prepared and disposed thereby to judge so from time to time. This discovery leaves such a sense and impression on the heart, as inclines it for ever to judge so concerning God: They never forget what they have seen, and so are inclined to judge after the like manner. And the more frequent∣ly they have eminent discoveries of God and Christ, the more strongly they are inclined to judge so, and to reject the contrary temptati∣ons. Repeated discoveries strengthen the habit, and dispose them with more readiness to judge so. The inclination to judge aright of God is a rational inclination, flowing from a conviction of the gloriousness of God.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> The first thing that this Light discovers is the Gloriousness of God.</HEAD>
<P>MAny men that have had experience of this spiritual light, are able to give a very poor account how it doth at first work in their heart. The understanding is so quick in it's operations, that the steps of those dis∣coveries that are made to the soul, dont fall under their observation. They may be able to give some account what they saw, that they saw such and such encouragement to come to Christ; but they don't know how they came to be convinced of it. But we have abundant cause to conclude, that the first discovery that is made is of the <HI>gloriousness of God.</HI> The knowledge of God is the foun∣dation of all religion: Psal. 36.10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving-kindness to them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</HI> Joh. 1.3. <HI>This is eternal life to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI></P>
<P>Two things will make this evident.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. The <HI>spiritual knowledge of God doth not depend upon the spiritual knowledge of other things.</HI> There needs no antecedent discoveries in order to the spiritual know∣ledge
<PB N="40" REF="002072_0041_0FBB7ADE1A48CA50"/>
of God. When God opens the eyes of men, and gives spiritual understanding to them, there are two ways wherein they may see the glory of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. By <HI>reasoning from the works of Creation and common Providence.</HI> There is a great disco∣very of the glory of God in making the world, Psal. 19.1. <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy works.</HI> Isai. 6.3. <HI>The whole earth is full of his glory.</HI> And when they behold the work of God, they may readily see, if their eyes be opened, that these things were made by a God of in∣finite power, and wisdom, and goodness. There is a self-evidencing light in these works of God, shewing that they are the effects of a God of infinite glory. The world is a glass, reflecting the glory of God; and when men's eyes are opened, they may plainly see it. So in other of the great works of God; the ge∣neral deluge, the burning of Sodom, the de∣livery of Israel out of Egypt, maintaining them in the wilderness, &amp;c. God often puts us in mind, that he has <HI>created the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.</HI> That is an abundant manifestation to them that un∣derstand, that he is a glorious God, worthy to be believed, and loved, and obeyed. When men's eyes are opened, they see the force of the argument, they are at once satisfyed about the glorious properties of God. Reason en∣lightned by the Spirit of God, teaches men convincingly what God is.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="41" REF="002072_0042_0FBB7AE1B6C58F88"/>2. <HI>By reasoning from the word of God.</HI> The word of God has a self-evidencing light in it; it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shews that it doth proceed from a God of infinite Glory. The holiness of the law, and the wisdom and grace that appears in the gospel, are in themselves very evidential of God's glory. And tho' multitudes of men that read and hear the word, are not convin∣ced of the divine authority of it; yet when God lets in beams of spiritual light, they receive it as the <HI>word of God;</HI> they are con∣vinced that it proceeds from a God of infi∣nite Glory. When God shines into the heart, they see the <HI>glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>They do with open face be∣hold as in a glass the glory of the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.18. They say, such things would never <HI>have entered into the heart of man,</HI> if God had not revealed them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.9.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. The <HI>spiritual knowledge of other things, doth depend on the spiritual knowledge of God.</HI> The knowledge of particular reveal∣ed truths doth depend upon the knowledge of God. Until they know God they can have no Faith; Faith depends upon the knowledge of God. Until they know God, they don't see a foundation for Faith, nor know any thing that is to be known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly by Faith. Until men know God, they can't know the <HI>saving benefit of the blood of Christ,</HI> or the <HI>Divinity of Christ,</HI> or the <HI>certainty of the Promises,</HI> or the <HI>happiness of Heaven;</HI> for
<PB N="42" REF="002072_0043_0FBB7AE2C9F46E70"/>
all <HI>Faith</HI> doth depend upon our assurance of the <HI>faithfulness of God:</HI> But when once we are convinced of the faithfulness of God, we are prepared to believe whatever God has re∣vealed. If God reveals things that are beyond natural reason to comprehend, as the doctrine of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and of the <HI>Incarnation of the Son of God;</HI> such men will believe it. If God reveals things that are very contrary to carnal reason; As, that God is angry with carnal men, tho' they live in great prosperity; and that he delights in godly men, and will save them, tho' they are low, and in great afflicti∣on. If he promises pardon to them that have been very sinful, if they accept of the offers of the Gospel, such men will believe it. The consideration of the everlasting faithfulness of God, will overcome all objections. If men were at never so much loss about the truth of them before, and rejected them as false, or suspended their belief, looking on them as uncertain; yet as soon as ever he understands the faithfulness of God, the darkness of his mind is removed; he sees a foundatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for Faith, and so those things which were mysteries to him before, are now heartily acknowledged. Heb. 11.7. <HI>Faith is the evidence of things not seen.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> The Soul being convinced of the Glo∣riousness of God, sees Encourage∣ment to accept of Christ.</HEAD>
<P>MUltitudes that are called to come, do upon one occasion or other excuse themselves: Yea, men that are in great di∣stress for the want of forgiveness, do reject the offer. They would fain be pardoned, &amp; pray to God to accept them upon Christ's account; but they dare not accept of the offer of mercy. They have all manner of perswasions but re∣main unperswadable; they resolve to do it, they may attempt it, but don't effect it: It seems a dangerous thing, and a method to cast away their own souls; they think God would be very angry with them for obtruding themselves upon him: It seems to them a desperate adventure. But when they are <HI>convinced of the gloriousness of God, they see encouragement enough to come to Christ.</HI></P>
<P>They see three things especially that are encouragement to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>free Grace of God.</HI> They were wont to discourage themselves because of their unworthiness; it seemed to them as if the heart of God was turned against them, and
<PB N="44" REF="002072_0045_0FBB7AE5B0A5C7F8"/>
they laboured in that that they might get something to incline the heart of God towards them, that might appease his anger, and at∣tract his love: But when they have the know∣ledge of God, they are satisfyed in the free∣ness of his grace; they see that there is enough in his own heart to move him, that there is an infinite ocean of grace there, that his thoughts are not as our thoughts, that there is an <HI>height and depth, and length and breadth in the love of God,</HI> that it <HI>passeth knowledge;</HI> that he can pity his greatest ene∣mies, and love those that have nothing to commend them. They say he is God and not man: His mercy dont depend on any excellency in them. His grace is sovereign grace, and he has <HI>mercy on whom he will have mercy.</HI> Though it be a great thing to be pardoned and saved, yet it is not too much for him to do. There is no need of any thing to move his heart; he can do it because it pleaseth him. They were wont formerly to limit the mercy of God, and to think it would have been sufficient, if they had not been such great sinners, or if they were more broken for their sins; but now they are convinced, that if they were worse than they are, that the mercy of God is sufficient for them; that there is an infiniteness in the grace of God; and after they have reckoned up many things that grace can do, that there is infinitely more than they can think of.

Sometimes they doubted of them because of the greatness of them, sometimes because God was angry with them, sometimes because there were but few that were saved. But when this Light comes into the soul, they see the certainty of these promises; they come with a divine authority upon the heart. 1 Thes. 2.13. <HI>Ye received the word, not as the word of man, but as it was indeed the word of God.</HI> The faithfulness of God convinces them that the promise is sure. They receive it as infallible: They dont build their perswasio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon the opinions of men, but upon the word of God. Many men dispute with a great deal of confidence for the principles of reli∣gion, against <HI>Papists,</HI> and <HI>Socinians,</HI> but it is upon that supposition, that the Scripture is the word of God; and that they take for granted, but do not know it.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> No man is able to give a full Account of all that he saw when this light did first shine into his heart.</HEAD>
<P>THere is a great deal of difference in this light as to the clearness of it; all that have this Spiritual light do not see thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the like clearness; the discoveries an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more dim in some than in others. There are degrees of natural light, so of the light of reason, so of spiritual light. This light is sometimes called <HI>wisdom.</HI> Sometimes becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the clearness of it, it is called <HI>revelatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Eph. 1.17. <HI>That God would give unto you t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the know¦ledge of him.</HI> But whether the sight be clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or more obscure, they do all see the truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Gospel; that Christ is a sufficient found<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tion for them to build upon, that 'tis safe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> east themselves upon him; that Christ is pre¦cious, and that the Gospel is of divine au∣thority. But no man is able to give an exact account of all that he did see at that time The thing was done in the twinkling of an eye; and tho' men never forget it, yet they cannot call to mind all that they were convinced of; no, not if they were to give
<PB N="49" REF="002072_0050_0FBB7AF3266CC2F0"/>
an account the next hour. Men have not at that time the actual understanding of all gospel principles: Indeed they saw that that way of Salvation that they had been for ma∣ny years instructed in was true; but they have not the actual understanding of them at the very time: Yet they did see, and actu∣ally understood at the time, a great deal more than they can remember.</P>
<P>This may appear by these things,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the <HI>shortness of the time</HI> wherein this discovery is made. There is but a very little time between the opening of the eyes, and the hearts closing with Christ, &amp; the dis∣covery is wont to last but a little time; and so it is impossible that he should have a distinct remembrance of every thing that he saw, The <HI>Spouse</HI> gives a very particular description of Christ in figurative expressions, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5. <HI>from v.</HI> 16. <HI>ad fin.</HI> And so Godly men are able to do from what they find in the word of God; but they can remember but a little account of what they saw at that time. If a man cast up his eyes to heaven, he sees a multitmde of stars; but is not able to give a particular account of what he saw of the several stars and constellations. So, if a man should cast his eye upon a beautiful Person, he is much affected with his beauty; but he can't give a particular account of all his features, the comeliness of his forehead, eyes, cheeks and lips, nor give
<PB N="50" REF="002072_0051_0FBB7AF48B2CFE10"/>
a description of them. If a man should cast his eye upon a <HI>Garden</HI> wherein there is a variety of flowers, he may be much affected with it, yet not able to tell particularly what sorts of flowers he saw. Or if he should cast his eye upon a curious piece of <HI>Embroidery,</HI> he may perceive immediately that there is much curiosity in it; but he can't give an account of all the colours and resem∣blances that he cast his eye upon. Thus it is when men's eyes are opened. They see the way of Salvation to be a glorious way, but they can't tell particularly all that they saw; they had but a transient sight, and could not take such distinct notice of things, as to lay them up in their memory.</P>
<P N="2">2. There <HI>is need of the actual knowledge of many gospel Truths, in order to the first closing with Christ.</HI> They heard of those things of∣ten before, but they understood nothing in a right manner before; but they must under∣stand them in order to their closing with Christ. They need to understand something of the <HI>Greatness</HI> of that Salvation that is offered. Men will not accept the offer, except they judge it worthy to be accepted. They need to understand, that the <HI>offer is made to them;</HI> the making of such an offer to others is no warrant to them to accept thereof. They need to understand <HI>their sins may be pardoned;</HI> that the law dont render them uncapable of Pardon. They need to understand, that it is
<PB N="51" REF="002072_0052_0FBB7AF60DAC1B58"/>
God himself that makes the offer in the Gos∣pel: Nothing less than that can be an en∣couragement to accept. Men need to under∣stand that God has <HI>Mercy</HI> enough to pardon all their Sins, though they have no worthi∣ness: If they do not understand this, they will not dare to accept the offer. They need to understand the <HI>Faithfulness of God,</HI> else they can see no safety in coming to Christ. They need to understand the <HI>saving Vertue of the blood of Christ;</HI> that it is acceptable to God, and sufficient to purge away Sin. They need to understand that Christ Jesus is the <HI>Son of God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat they may be satisfyed in the divine ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of his blood. They need to understand that God <HI>made</HI> him a <HI>Mediator,</HI> and <HI>woun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed him for our Transgressions.</HI> They had need to understand the sufficiency of Christ to sanctify them and make them per∣severe, and God ability to fulfil his promi∣ses. And there is no godly man that can re∣cover the remembrance of it, that at that time he saw all these things. Some can re∣member more than others; but none can call to mind all that he saw at that time.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because at that time men's thoughts are so fixed upon <HI>one or two particular things,</HI> that they are hindered thereby from remembring some other things. Experience shews that some men at their first conversion, have their thoughts more fixed on the consideration of the <HI>free Mercy of God:</HI> They see a depth of
<PB N="52" REF="002072_0053_0FBB7AF7CFFAC648"/>
compassion in the heart of God; that he has no need of any external motive to draw his heart; that he can overlook all manner of provocations, <HI>has mercy on whom he will, and compassion on whom he will have compassion,</HI> as Rom. 9.15. Some men at the time had their thoughts more taken up about the <HI>Sacrifice of Christ,</HI> how he has born the curse, bought us with a price, made his Soul an offering for Sin, fully satisfyed the Justice of God. And some others have their thoughts at the time more fixed upon the <HI>Faithfulness of God,</HI> that his <HI>words are pure words,</HI> that he is <HI>not as a man that he should lie, nor the Son of man that he should repent;</HI> that his word is a sure foundation to build upon. It is frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o afterwards. They are led into it sometime by the consideration of some <HI>Scripture</HI> that comes to mind at that time. Sometimes by having special temptation just before; as if God could not find in his heart to par∣don such as they; as if Christ's blood would not answer for their Sins, &amp;c. And the thoughts being fixed on one encourage∣ment makes others less observed. If a man takes partieular notice of one <HI>Argument</HI> in a discourse, he can give the less account of the rest. If a man takes special notice of what concerns himself in a discourse, he will not take such particular notice of what concerns others. If there be a great Shew, one person takes more notice of one par∣ticular,
<PB N="53" REF="002072_0054_0FBB7AFE6B0273C8"/>
another of another, and are not able to give so good an account of the other things that they saw.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> This Spiritual Light doth discover those things that Men were convinced of before under the Work of Prepara∣tion, and that in a better manner than they saw them before.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore God converts men, it is his manner to prepare them for it by a common work of his Spirit, which is called <HI>Pre∣paratory,</HI> which puts men upon it to be sen∣sibly seeking after reconciliation. Men are called upon to <HI>seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness;</HI> to <HI>labour not for the meat that perishes, but for that meat that doth endure unto eternal life.</HI> And men are bla∣med for slighty seeking, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24. Many seek and are not able to enter. And that was the happiness of some, their hearts were mightily set in seeking the kingdom of God, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.13. Men are labouring, some a long while for peace with God before they are converted: They are convinced of the vanity of the world, and of the necessity of the fa∣vour of God and eternal life: They are con∣vinced
<PB N="54" REF="002072_0055_0FBB7B00B605BE10"/>
also of the insufficiency of their own righteousness, so as to relinquish hopes from that, but when God lets in spiritual light to convert men, that doth discover the same that they saw under the work of preparation; and that after a better manner than they saw them before.</P>
<P N="1">1. When God gives spiritual light and re∣veals his Grace and the Glory of Christ to the Soul, that <HI>discovers those things that they saw under the work of preparation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That will discover the <HI>terribleness of Damnation.</HI> One thing that Sinners are sen∣sible of under the work of preparation is, that the wrath of God is terrible: And they are wont to cry out as he, <HI>What must I do to be saved,</HI> Act. 16.30. And as <HI>David, There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger, nor any rest in my bones because of my sin,</HI> Psal. 48.3. They see they have exposed them∣selves to the heavy wrath of God, and are liable to damnation, which is intollerable. Isai. 33.14. <HI>Who can dwell with devouring fire who can dwell with everlasting burnings?</HI> And the sense of this is wont to fill them with <HI>Terror;</HI> they are afraid of dying quick∣ly, and they are urged in spirit to cry to God, and beg the pardon of their Sins. This stirs them up carefully to reform their lives, and leave off all sinful practices, and to resist temptations. This makes them sensible of the vanity of the world. And
<PB N="55" REF="002072_0056_0FBB7B020A1A7CA0"/>
when gospel light is let into men, they will see the terribleness of the wrath of God for Sin. If they did not see that, they would not see the necessity of coming to Christ for Salvation; but when they see the truth of the Gospel, they will be convinced of that; for then they will see the faithfulness of God, and the truth of the threatnings of the law: Then they will believe the greatness of Christ's sufferings, and thereby see the terri∣ble wrath of God for Sin. Luk. 23.31. <HI>If these things be done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</HI> In the sorrows of Christ they will discern how intollerable the wrath of God is, and what need there is of deliverance from it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That will discover the <HI>vanity and in∣sufficiency of men's own righteousness.</HI> Under the work of preparation they are by degrees led into the understanding of their own un∣worthiness, that they can do nothing to pa∣cify the wrath, or merit the favour of God. When sinners are in distress of conscience, they are wont to labour to lay some bonds on the justice, or faithfulness, or mercy of God; and in length of time God is wont to shew them that their righteousness dont an∣swer the law, satisfys for no Sin, can't draw the heart of God to them; that by their best works they are meriting condemnation; that their hearts are full of enmity to God; that they have no power to do any good; that
<PB N="56" REF="002072_0057_0FBB7B03A19A0918"/>
they have nothing of their own to depend upon, but stand in need of free grace and the righteousness of Christ: And when the gos∣pel light is let into them, that teaches them the emptiness of their own works. When men see the excellency of Christ's righteous∣ness, they see it is a vain thing for them to think to pacify God themselves; they shall never be able to get any thing of their own that is comparable to the righteousness of Christ: That alone will serve their turn, and they have no need of any other. Phil. 3.7. <HI>What things were gain to me, those I count∣ed loss for Christ.</HI> When men see their own hearts under the work of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> they see the vanity of their own righteousness; but when they see the righteousness of Christ, they see further into the vanity of it, and prefer Christ's righteousness, and count <HI>their own</HI> as <HI>dung</HI> in comparison with Christ's. Phil. 3.8. <HI>And count them but dung that I may win Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They are convinced of these things af∣ter a <HI>better manner</HI> than they are under the work of preparation. Under the work of preparation, they are convinced of them by the illuminations of <HI>natural Conscience.</HI> They see there is great danger of damnation, and that damnation is intolerable, and that the world is vain; that their own righteousness cannot draw the heart of God; that it is just with God to destroy them. And some things
<PB N="57" REF="002072_0058_0FBB7B0514C780F8"/>
they are convinced of by <HI>Experience;</HI> as, that they are blind, and under the dominion of their sins, that they are <HI>dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> But when spiritual light is let into them, they know these things after a better manner; then they see these by faith; they believe the testimony of God in his word, and this has a better effect upon the heart. He sees so much of the world, that he hates a worldly spirit; he sees the vanity of a worldly spirit, so that it is mortifyed ever after; and the vanity of his own righteous∣ness, and hates a self-righteous spirit.</P>

<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> The way considered, wherein God by this spiritual Light doth convert Men, or make them holy.</HEAD>
<P>WHen Man is in his corrupt estate the <HI>Essence</HI> of the soul remains intire, and that natural disposition remains in the Will to follow the last dictates of the Understand∣ing; so that when God makes this change in the <HI>Understanding,</HI> there is always a pro∣portionable change made in the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> When God makes an Understanding he makes a Will, and when he renews the Understanding he renews the Will: They are not two things,
<PB N="58" REF="002072_0059_0FBB7B068FAFC710"/>
but one and the same soul, diversely deno∣minated according to <HI>two</HI> several <HI>ways of working,</HI> which are inseparably conjoined. When the soul has this spiritual light, it necessarily acts accordingly. Therefore the way to conversion is this,</P>
<P N="1">I. The soul <HI>sees the reason and foundation of spiritual carriages.</HI> Holy carriages are ve∣ry reasonable; but whatever is presented be∣fore men to perswade them, nothing will have any efficacy on them, until God gives spiritual light; for naturally they are blind, they are at a loss about the reality of those things, tho' they make a continual professi∣on of them: But when God shines into their hearts with the light of life, they are con∣vinced of those things that are the founda∣tions of such carriages. They counted them probable before, but now they are evident to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. They see the <HI>foundations of faith in Je∣sus Christ.</HI> When the eyes of men are open∣ed they see the gracious Nature of God, that he can have mercy on whom he will have mercy, that he can find in his heart to have compassion, on them, though they be meer creatures and uncapable to be any pro∣fit to him, though they cannot recompence him; and though sinful creatures, whatever be the number and aggravation of their sins: they see that there is an <HI>excellency</HI> in the <HI>lo∣ving
<PB N="59" REF="002072_0060_0FBB7B099B1BED18"/>
kindness</HI> of God. Psal. 36.7. They are convinced that none is like to God in Mercy; that he can abundantly pardon; that <HI>his ways are not as our ways;</HI> that he is the God of all Grace; that his mercy is unlimited; that his mercy passes knowledge; and so their unworthiness is no ground of discouragement. He sees also a sufficiency in Christ, <HI>Christ is precious in his eyes.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.7. God has made a new and living way by the blood of Christ; what tears would not do, what thou∣sands of Rams could not effect, that has been done by the <HI>blood of Christ;</HI> Christ has an∣swered all the challenges of the Law, and made reconciliation, bought off our Punish∣ment, and made a purchase of Eternal Life, he has fulfilled every jot and title of the law, there be <HI>unsearchable riches in Christ,</HI> there is blood enough to cleanse away all Sin, a sacrifice sufficient to make atonement, price enough for our redemption, so that they may be sav'd without any reflection on the Just∣tice of God. He also sees the <HI>faithfulness of God</HI> in the offers of the Gospel. God invites him to come to Jesus Christ, and commands him to believe, and has promised to accept of him in a way of coming to Christ, Acts 10.43. <HI>To him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall have remission of Sins.</HI> And when men see those things, they see abundant incourage∣ment to come to Christ, these incouragements
<PB N="60" REF="002072_0061_0FBB7B0B86C43D20"/>
remove all difficulties, there is no one objecti∣on but is easily answered, the way is clear &amp; plain, they see there can be no danger in rely∣ing on Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. They see the <HI>foundation of love.</HI> When their eyes are opened to see the <HI>gloriousness of God,</HI> they must needs see the reason why they should love him: for all the attributes of God, <HI>are lovely;</HI> his <HI>Grace</HI> is lovely; his <HI>Mercy</HI> is very endearing that he has a heart to pardon Sin; and to provide a way of Sal∣vation for Sinners; his <HI>Glory</HI> is renowned up∣on that account. Mic. 7.18. <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning iniquity,</HI> —c. God is mightily praised in the Church upon that ac∣count, that his mercy endured for ever. His <HI>Justice</HI> also is a lovely excellent property, his name is celebrated upon that account; the church praises him upon that consideration: Rev. 19.2. <HI>That true and righteous are his judgments.</HI> So his <HI>Holiness</HI> is lovely; the <HI>Seraphims</HI> cry before him, <HI>holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of Hosts.</HI> His <HI>Wisdom</HI> is lovely; that is his glory that he <HI>searches the heart and trys the reins of the children of men.</HI> Jer. 17.10. His <HI>Power</HI> is lovely. Psal. 21.13. <HI>Be thou exalted Lord by thy own Strength, so will we sing and praise thy Power.</HI> His <HI>Faith∣fulness</HI> is lovely; that is his commendation, that <HI>his faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.</HI> Psal. 36.5. that he remembers his cove∣nant from generataion to generation. He is
<PB N="61" REF="002072_0062_0FBB7B0E4C9E5CA8"/>
praise worthy because of <HI>all his attributes;</HI> he therein excels all men and Angels; he de∣serves to be loved <HI>with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the strength.</HI> All his Attributes are Perfections, and we have rea∣son to delight in him. He is so excellent on the account of them that we have reason to make it the business of our lives to glorifie him; we have reason to take a complacency in him, and chuse him for our portion. When men see those attributes, they see upon what account he may justly challenge their love.</P>
<P N="3">3. They see the <HI>foundation of humility.</HI> When this Spiritual light shines into Men, and they see the gloriousness of God, they un∣derstand that <HI>all nations to him are as the drop of the bucket, and as the dust of the ballance, they are before him as nothing, and they are less than nothing and vanity,</HI> as 'tis said, Isai. 49.15, 17. There is abundant reason to be thankful to him for the least mercy, and to say as <HI>David</HI> that <HI>he humbleth himself to behold the things that are upon the earth,</HI> as Psal. 113.6. And that it becomes them to be sub∣ject to his disposals in all things; to sacrifice all their interests to his glory, and to be o∣bedient to his voice in every thing; to be abased because of their Sins, and lie in the dust before him, as <HI>Job</HI> did, Job. 12.5.6. <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee; wherefore I abhor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="62" REF="002072_0063_0FBB7B118E7FB350"/>
self and repent in dust and ashes.</HI> When their eyes are opened to see God's glory, they see reason to lie low before him. Psal. 8.3.4. When <HI>I consider the heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon and stars that thou hast or∣dained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visitest him.</HI> When men see the gloriousness of God, they see it an unreasonable thing to set up their wisdom against the wisdom of God, and their will against the will of God, and their interest against the glory of God. They see an infinite difference between God and them, and that there is all reason that they should be humble.</P>
<P N="2">II. When they <HI>see the foundation of holy carriages, they do immediately carry holily.</HI> They forthwith come to Christ with a spirit of love and humility. When he sees the foundation of gracious carriages, he will car∣ry graciously. Now he acts reasonably in trusting in Christ and loving God. While he was in the dark he was unperswadable; they might as soon prevail with a stone as with him: But when he sees that that is the pro∣per motive, that will work upon his heart. When men see reason to be afraid, they will be afraid, and when they see reason to hope, they will hope. So, when they see reason to believe, they will believe; thorough con∣viction always prevails on the heart; God
<PB N="63" REF="002072_0064_0FBB7B135CD1A7B0"/>
carries on his work by <HI>Light.</HI> When suitable light is let int o the heart, sinners are scared; and when they see their own badness, they are broken off from their own righteousness; and when they are <HI>turned from darkness to light,</HI> they are <HI>turned from the power of Sa∣tan to God,</HI> Act. 26.18. When God teaches men, then they come to Christ; Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. When they see the foundation of holy carriages they are <HI>able to carry holily.</HI> Men cannot come to Christ unless the Father draw them, Joh. 6.44. But the way whereby he draws them is by <HI>teaching them,</HI> v. 45. And when this light is let into them, they are able. Many sinners are concerned to get the pardon of sin; and they resolve to come to Christ, and they strive to come to Christ, but they cannot; it seems to them a dangerous thing to venture themselves on Christ, and they cannot overcome their fears: They set many incouraging considerations before them∣selves, but they cannot vanquish their fears; they dare not for their heart venture upon Christ: They are as unable to come as a man that is bound with chains is to come out of prison. It is a terror to them to continue as they be, yet they dare not cast themselves up∣on Christ: But when their eyes are opened to see the free grace of God and the precious∣ness of Christ, their fears are removed; their
<PB N="64" REF="002072_0065_0FBB7B1657A34118"/>
fetters are taken off, and now they can come: Yea, they dare not stay away from Christ, they would not for a world stay away from Christ: <HI>Satan</HI> with all his artifices cannot perswade them to neglect Christ. They have been in great distress, and now they see the relief that is provided for them; they are under a necessity in their own spirits to ac∣cept the call. In like manner when they see the gloriousness of God, they are able to love him. They were before urged in conscience to do it, and had abundance of arguments set before them to induce them to love him; but nothing would prevail upon them, be∣cause they were strangers to the loveliness of God: But as soon as ever their eyes were opened to see the glorious grace of God in the gospel, now they can love him. They made a profession before, but now they are sincere; Psal. 36.10. <HI>Stretch forth thy loving kindness to them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</HI> The heart is drawn to God; they cannot deny their love to him. Whatever was dear to them before, now God is dearest to them. And in like manner, now they can indeed abase them∣selves, when they see the divine excellency of God: They look on themselves infinitely in∣feriour to him, and lay themselves low before him.</P>
<P N="2">2. When they see the foundation of holy carriages, they <HI>love to carry holily.</HI> There
<PB N="65" REF="002072_0066_0FBB7B17CA901230"/>
is naturally an enmity in the heart to holy carriages; Rom. 8.7. <HI>The natural mind is en∣mity to God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> But this light makes them love holy carriages. When men see the preciousness of Christ, it mightily suits them to come to him; they take a complacency in coming to Christ. Some men force them∣selves after a fashion to venture on Christ; but when they see the divine authority of the gospel, they love to come to him, as the hungry man loves to eat, and the thirsty to drink. Acts 16.34. <HI>He rejoyced, believing in God.</HI> He sees that that makes it pleasant to him; he sees that God is worthy of that honour: He is a God of such grace and faith∣fulness, that he is worthy to be trusted in; and he sees that the honour of a glorious Mediator is due to Christ; and he sees that it is a safe thing to come to Christ. There is no rest any where else for the sole of his foot, but Christ is a sure foundation, a pre∣cious corner stone: His heart takes content∣ment in relying upon him: All the world shall not perswade him to forsake him, and make choice of any other refuge. Isai. 45.24. <HI>Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I righte∣ousness and strength.</HI> So, the man loves to make the glory of God his end; and he loves to abase himself before God, and look upon himself as vanity, and nothing in comparison of God. The sight of the excellency of
<PB N="66" REF="002072_0067_0FBB7B1947F2D210"/>
God and Christ draws his heart; and he loves these holy carriages. There was an antipathy against them in his heart before; but now God and Christ are lovely in his eyes, and he has a mind to come to Christ, and to honour God, and he will not be restrained; for such carriages are pleasant to him. The glory of God and Christ draws the heart sweetly and powerfully, and he rejoyceth therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Spiritual light <HI>makes the heart stand bent that way.</HI> This doth not only draw forth gracious actings, but leaves an Impression and Bias upon the heart that way. Beauty draws forth an act of Love and leaves a disposition to love. This sight changes the mind and makes men judge otherwise of God and Christ than they used to do, and it chan∣ges the heart and inclines it to carry suitably. The conviction is an abiding conviction, and so the disposition is abiding. This discove∣ry is like the <HI>needles</HI> touching the <HI>loadstone,</HI> it inclines it toward the <HI>north.</HI> When this light is let into the man he is principled to trust in Christ, to love God, and live in a way of obedience, it prepares his heart to live in such a way. When once he is through∣ly convinced of the gloriousness of God and Christ, he is set in that way and it will abide with him as long as he liveth; there is an <HI>im∣pression</HI> left on the heart that will never wear
<PB N="67" REF="002072_0068_0FBB7B1AE45AB3A0"/>
out. 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open face be∣holding as in a glass the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. When they do perform those holy carria∣ges, they are <HI>inclined to perform them.</HI> It were impossible for to do them without an inclina∣tion to do them. If the heart were not incli∣ned to trust in Christ, they would not trust in him. Holy actions are never forced. Men may be under a necessity to love God and trust in Christ, but that necessity don't arise from compulsion but from inclination. Psal. 110.3. <HI>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.</HI> Before the man had aversion to those gracious actions, he was under the dominion of a contrary inclination, but when he doth them, he is inclined to do them; and that <HI>actual inclination</HI> leaves an <HI>habitual inclinati∣on</HI> on the heart that way. We indeed com∣monly say that one act don't make a habit; but we mean that one act doth not make a∣more perfect habit; as <HI>habit</HI> is distinguished from <HI>disposition,</HI> which is called <HI>habitus imper∣fectus.</HI> But one act commonly doth leave something of an inclination that way: one act of love to another person or thing disposes the heart to renew that act of love. One act is preparation for another of the same kind; One act of faith puts the Soul into a believe∣ing frame: and one act of humility into an humble frame; he is more inclined to believe again than he was, and the clearer discovery
<PB N="68" REF="002072_0069_0FBB7B1DC2A6BDD0"/>
he had of God and Christ, the more strongly he doth believe, and the greater inclination doth remain in him to believe.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such men as have this spiritual <HI>discove∣ry never do utterly forget it.</HI> It is possible for a man to forget the first time when he had the discovery of God and Christ made to him, yet I judge that is not ordinary; but if he doth forget the time, yet he never utterly forgets the thing, he remembers that he hath seen God and Christ to be glorious: There be many times when he hath not the actual remembrance of it, and many times also when he has corrupt apprehensions concerning God and Christ, and may be under the prevailings of carnal reason and unbelief, yet he never ut∣terly forgets what he has been convinced of, but doth recover the convictions that the Gospel is true, and Jesus Christ is an alsuffi¦cient Saviour, and so the inclination to holi∣ness doth abide in his heart. 1 Joh. 2.27. <HI>The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you.</HI> And though he hath not such discoveries as he hath had, yet he knows that he hath seen it and accordingly he hath an inclination still to carry holily, when the Glory of God and Christ are out of sight. The man is sure from what he has seen that it is so, and that maintains an inclination in him to carry himself holily.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> There is a great difference between Converting Light, and common Illumination.</HEAD>
<P>MEn are wont to distinguish between <HI>rational</HI> conviction and <HI>spiritual.</HI> Which distinction had need to be carefully understood; for man's rational faculty is the subject both of common and of spiritual conviction. We have no other faculty capa∣ble to receive conviction but our <HI>Reason.</HI> When the spirit of God gives common con∣viction, he works upon reason; and when he gives spiritual conviction, he likewise works upon reason, Besides, spiritual conviction is rational conviction: Godly men act under∣standingly and rationally, when they judge God to be worthy to be trusted, loved and obeyed; when they judge Christ to be the eternal Son of God, and an alsufficient Savi∣our. Yet the <HI>distinction</HI> may be allowed if it be thus explained; that <HI>rational conviction</HI> is that which men by their natural reason do attain; which they may gain by the force of their natural reason, improving the works and word of God; which differs very much from that conviction which men have by the sa∣ving work of God's Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="002072_0071_0FBB7B252E706998"/><HI>Common Illumination</HI> is of <HI>two sorts;</HI> one is from the more common improvements of na∣tural reason, the other from more affecting dis∣coveries wrought by a common work of the Spirit of God. There is a conviction that ri∣seth from the common improvement of natu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l reason. Thus men see clearly the <HI>Protest∣ant</HI> religion is better than the <HI>Popish:</HI> That it must needs be a work of wonderful wisdom and power to make the world, that the sacri∣fice of the Son of God must needs be of great value, that it was great love for God to give his Son to die: And hundreds of things of the like nature.</P>
<P>Besides these rational convictions there are <HI>affecting discoveries</HI> of divine truths by the <HI>common work of the Spirit</HI> which make for a time a considerable impression on the heart. Luk. 14.15. <HI>When one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God;</HI> Mat. 13.20. <HI>He that receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it.</HI> 2 Pet. 2.20. <HI>For if after they have escap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the pollutions of the world through the knowled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they a intangled therein and overcome:</HI> Heb. 1.4, 5, 6 <HI>For it is impossible for them that were once in∣lightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God and the pow∣ers
<PB N="71" REF="002072_0072_0FBB7B260E109600"/>
of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance.</HI></P>
<P>These two sorts of illumination, are resem∣blances of a <HI>twofold spiritual Illmmination</HI> that saints have. One is by sanctified reason, whereby men are convinced of divine truths. Men understand the divine authority of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Scripture, and thereby they are assured of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> truth of Promises and Threatnings: They are assured that God made the world, and from thence they are convinced of his eternal Power and Godhead: They know that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, and there∣by they know the saving vertue of his Blood.</P>
<P>The other is by special discoveries of di∣vine truths. They are led into <HI>Christ's cham∣bers,</HI> as the 'phrase is, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4. God breaks into the heart by divine light, and gives great discoveries of his faithfulness, of his holiness, his grace, the delight he takes in the sacrifice of Christ, and many other things. 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>God hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.</HI> Both these ways of conviction seem to be intimated, Eph. 1.17. <HI>That God may give unto you, the spirit of wis∣dom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between those convictions that rise from the improvement of natural reason, and that do arise from spiritual reason, lies in these two things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="72" REF="002072_0073_0FBB7B278EE63198"/>1. Natural reason <HI>doth not discover the Cer∣tainty of divine things.</HI> Sanctified reason doth see them to be <HI>sure,</HI> Joh. 6.69. <HI>We believe and are sure that thou art Christ the Son of the living God.</HI> Joh. 17.8. <HI>They have known that I came from thee, and they have believed that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hou hast sent me.</HI> Heb. 11.1. <HI>Faith is the evi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of things not seen.</HI> 1 Thes. 2.13. <HI>They received the word not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God.</HI> But natural reason doth not discover the <HI>Certainty</HI> of di∣vine truths: That can perceive the connecti∣on between one divine truth and another, and perceive how one thing follows certainly from another; but it doth not perceive the certainty of any. Carnal mens reasoning is from supposition; they reason very rationally, but they do not see that which is the founda∣tion of their reasoning to be certain. Carnal men and Godly men do both of them argue from the divine Nature of Christ. Both car∣nal men and godly do strongly argue, that if Christ be the Son of God, there is a divine vertue in his sufferings; and that it is safe relying on him. But here lies the difference; the godly man <HI>knows</HI> that Christ is the Son of God, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.6. but the carnal man only <HI>sup∣poses</HI> that Christ is the Son of God. He says the Church believe it, the Old and New Testament give an account of it, and there be many things said that make much for the confirmation of it. He discovered the secret
<PB N="73" REF="002072_0074_0FBB7B290103E340"/>
thoughts of men, did many miraculous works, rose from the dead. Upon such accounts he supposes him to be the Son of God, and judges it a heinous crime for any to deny it; but he doth not know these things, for he is ignorant of the divine authority of the word, and dare not venture on Christ, for fear it should not be so. So it was with the <HI>Jews,</HI> they did not believe <HI>Moses,</HI> Joh. 5.46. Thus they both of them argue from the <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Sacraments.</HI> The godly man argues, that there were several types instituted by God, to shew the saving vertue of the blood of Christ; — the sacraments in the <HI>New Testament</HI> are instituted to be amemorial of Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.24. The god∣ly man argues from hence, that Christ has satis∣fyed the justice of God; that Christ was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.7. These sacrifices were only types of Christ, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.17. And he is abundantly satisfyed by these institutions, that Christ is a glorious Saviour. Another man argues in like manner, that God would never have appointed such Signs to signify Christ, if he would not have us trust in him. He has not appointed these signs to deceive us; God would never teach his people a false way of Salvation: But his wound is, that he don't know certainly the divine authority of those institutions; he doth not know but they were the inventions of men. So, they both of them argue strongly from the command to be∣lieve,
<PB N="74" REF="002072_0075_0FBB7B2AA683AA38"/>
from the promises of Salvation in a way of believing, from Christ's ascension and sitting at the right hand of God; but the carnal man is uncertain of those things that are foundations of his reasoning; he does not know but there is some mistake: He thinks that there is a great probability of the truth of those things, but he has no assurance: His principles are grounded on an uncertain pro∣position; and so he <HI>knows nothing as he ought to know.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Carnal reason doth not <HI>receive a right Idea of divine things.</HI> Godly men though they have the exercise of spiritual reason, can∣not find out the Almighty unto perfection: But yet they do know God and Jesus Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.3. They have a true idea of God; they know him to be one of infinite perfecti∣on; they know him to be a God of infinite power, grace and faithfulness; they are con∣vinced that he is worthy of that love, faith and submission that he calls for; Psal. 18.3. <HI>I will call upon God who is worthy to be praised.</HI> They know that divine honour is due to him; Psal. 29.2. <HI>Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name.</HI> But carnal men have not a right idea of God: They acknowledge that he is infinite in his perfections, and can give some description of his infinite perfections; but they have not a right <HI>Idea</HI> of his glori∣ous nature, are not sensible what reverence and glory is due to him; and therefore they
<PB N="75" REF="002072_0076_0FBB7B2C16F0E4F0"/>
are said to be ignorant of him: Joh. 4.8. <HI>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between those affecting illu∣minations that carnal men have, — those disco∣veries that are given to godly men, lies in these two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The illuminations that carnal men have, are <HI>affecting,</HI> but not <HI>convincing.</HI> They are many times much affected with <HI>Joy;</HI> so they said, <HI>What a blessedness is it!</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> preached the gospel unto them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.15. It works desires in them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.15. And their hearts upon that occasion may be migh∣tily weaned from the world, and taken up a∣bout heavenly things: They may be mightily transported with zeal. The people of the <HI>Jews</HI> were so affected with Christ, that they were of the mind to <HI>make him a King.</HI> But these illuminations don't convince them; the men remain ignorant of God, and Christ, and the truth of the gospel. These flashes of light do not discover the certainty of divine truths. The people that cry <HI>Hosanna</HI> to day, cry <HI>crucify him</HI> another time; and that was a sign that they did not know him; <HI>for had they known, they would not have crucifyed the Lord of glo∣ry,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.8. Many are greatly affected in the hearing of sermons, that do not firmly be∣lieve what they hear: Act. 25.48. <HI>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glori∣fied the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</HI> They were
<PB N="76" REF="002072_0077_0FBB7B31D8869850"/>
generally much affected, but it was only a <HI>select number</HI> that believed. <HI>Stony ground hearers</HI> are much affected, but not convinced. Men are often affected with such things as they look upon as probable; but special dis∣coveries that God makes to saints, are very affecting and <HI>convincing.</HI> Godly men must needs be affected with those discoveries, for they are wondrous in their eyes: Psal. 119.18. <HI>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous things in thy law.</HI> Sometimes the <HI>love of God</HI> is said to be <HI>shed abroad in their hearts;</HI> that implies great affection, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.5. Divine truths are of a very affecting nature; They will stir up joy, and sorrow, and desires, and zeal; but these discoveries do not affect them only, but convince them: They see the glory of God; Psal. 63.2. <HI>To see thy power and glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctu∣ary.</HI> They know the love of Christ that passeth knowledge, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.19. When they be∣hold the glory of God, they are convinced of the glory of God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.18. When God shines into their hearts, he gives the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. When men see the sun, they know it is the sun; and when they see the grace and faith∣fulness of God, they know he is such an one; they don't only see the gloriousness of mercy, and holiness, and faithfulness; but that God is gracious, and holy, and faithful.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="77" REF="002072_0078_0FBB7B35235ADF70"/>2. The illuminations of carnal men <HI>don't draw forth any gracious Exercises.</HI> The com∣mon discoveries that are given to carnal men, have a considerable effect upon them; besides the stirring up of affections spoken of before, they have an effect upon the conversation; they many times make men to <HI>reform</HI> their lives, and cast of sinful practices: 2 Pet. 2.20. <HI>They escape the pollutions of the world thro' the knowledge of Christ.</HI> Sometimes they en∣courage men in seeking the pardon of their sins. They may have such a discovery of the happiness of heaven, of the graciousness of God, and of the mercy of God in providing a way of salvation, as may greatly encourage them to continue seeking his favour. They may likewise have that effect to make men presumptuous. Men may from thence con∣clude their own estate good: They may take encouragements for assurances of the favour of God: May take occasion also from them to get a false faith. If they have some disco∣veries of a readiness in God to pardon sinners, they may take incouragement to think, that men so qualified as they, that are reformed and sorry for their sins, may be bold to ven∣ture on Christ: But those spiritual discove∣ries that God makes, do always draw forth the exercise of grace: Cant. 1.4. <HI>The king hath brought me to his chambers, we will be glad and delight in thee; the upright love thee.</HI> When God breaks into the heart by light,
<PB N="78" REF="002072_0079_0FBB7B369D178668"/>
the heart is drawn forth in love, and faith, and repentance. Communion is reciprocal. When God draws nigh to his People, that mightily stirs up a spirit of holiness; it doth not only strengthen assurance, but it stirs up all grace: Job. 42.5, 6. <HI>Now mine eye seeth thee, wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in dust and ashes.</HI> Eph. 3.19. <HI>And to know the love of Christ that passeth knowledge; that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</HI> This gives great increase to grace. 2 Pet. 1.2. <HI>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Conversion may be known.</HEAD>
<P>MEn may have the knowledge of their own conversion. The knowledge that other men have of it is uncertain; because no man can look into the heart of another, and see the workings of grace there: Yet men may know that they are godly. Some ungodly men think that they have grace; but that which is not, cannot be known: Things that are not, are called, <HI>things that do not appear,</HI> Heb. 11.3. <HI>That which is wanting cannot be numbred,</HI> Eccl. 1.15. All converted men don't know that they are converted. Tho' grace
<PB N="79" REF="002072_0080_0FBB7B380E328580"/>
be visible, yet many times it is not seen. Visible things are not always seen; sometimes because it is night, sometimes because they are covered. It is the <HI>Calamity,</HI> and many times the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of godly men that they are ignorant of their conversion. They do know that they have corruptions in them, and they may know that they have grace in them. This is very evident, because many godly men have known their good estate. If this knowledge had never been attained, it might more reasonably be questioned, whe∣ther it were attainable. <HI>Job</HI> was abundant∣ly satisfyed; Job. 10.7. <HI>Thou knowest that I am not wicked:</HI> And he was not mistaken, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.1. So <HI>David</HI> knew it; Psal. 17.15. <HI>As for me, I shall behold his face in righteousness.</HI> So <HI>Paul;</HI> 2 Tim. 4.7. <HI>I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.</HI> v. 8. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.</HI> And we don't know of one godly man in the <HI>Scripture</HI> that was under darkness about his sincerity. There be some Scriptures brought to prove the con∣trary, especially some passages of <HI>Psal.</HI> 88. But that <HI>Psalm</HI> represents to us not the par∣ticular case of <HI>Haman,</HI> but of the <HI>Church of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Further, it appears that conversion may be known, because we are directed to <HI>examine our selves</HI> in order to it; 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your selve: whether you be in the faith, prove
<PB N="80" REF="002072_0081_0FBB7B39ABDDA510"/>
your own selves; know you not that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates.</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.</HI> And to what purpose should we be advised to do a thing that is not do∣able? God don't advise us to impossibilities. All the commands of God are possible to be fulfilled; if not perfectly, yet they may be ful∣filled: Phil. 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Christ, who strengthneth me.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only add that consideration, that God makes many comfortable <HI>Promises</HI> to them that have grace; <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.7. 1 <HI>Jam.</HI> 12. <HI>Isai.</HI> 3.10. But if men could not know that they have grace, that would frustrate the de∣sign of these promises; that would take away the foundation of their comfort; they would be uncapable of making application of the promises to themselves. How much happi∣ness soever is made over to them in those promises; yet if they could not know their own grace, they must be strangers to their own happiness, and not rejoyce in the good that is made over to them.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> How may a godly man know that he has Grace?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. He cannot know it in a way of <HI>Ar∣guing.</HI> We come to the knowledge of many things in a way of reasoning; arguing from things known, to things that are not known.
<PB N="81" REF="002072_0082_0FBB7B3B5FC56C40"/>
Thus a man may know his justification: He may argue thus, He that hath faith in Christ is justified; or he that has love to God is justified; or he that loves the brethren is passed from death to life: Because there is a certain connection between these graces and a state of justification. Thus a man may know by reasoning, that he has this and that parti∣cular grace: He may argue so, If I have the grace of faith, I have the grace of love, or hu∣mility; because there is a concatenation of graces, and they are inseparable one from a∣nother: But they don't know that they are gracious in this manner; the knowledge of their graces don't come in at that door.</P>
<P N="1">1. He cannot prove it from any such acts as may proceed from other principles. A mo∣ral and religious conversation may proceed from other principles: Such a conversation is an argument to other men to be charitable, but it is no demonstration. The young man in the gospel walked exactly; Mat. 19.20. <HI>All these things have I done from my youth. Paul</HI> was conscientious; Phil. 3.6. <HI>Touching the righteousness that is in the Law I was blame∣less:</HI> Such a walk may proceed from fear of hell and hope of heaven. Zeal for God don't prove it: There may be zeal where there is no love: The <HI>Jews</HI> were great enemies to Christ, yet very zealous; Rom. 10.2. <HI>I bear them record, that they have a zeal for God. Paul</HI> had great zeal before he had any grace.
<PB N="82" REF="002072_0083_0FBB7B3FE93C7138"/>
Natural conscience may produce zeal. Great affections don't prove it: The <HI>Jews</HI> cryed, <HI>Hosanna to the Son of David.</HI> Striving against a self-righteous spirit don't prove it: Men may strive against it, yet not mortify it. Asso∣ciating with godly men don't prove it: <HI>Achi∣tophel</HI> was <HI>David's</HI> companion, <HI>Psal.</HI> 55.14. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrows for the afflictions of the Church, and desires for the Conversion of Souls don't prove it: These things may be found in car∣nal men, and so can be no evidences of grace. Those things that are common to saints and hypocrites, don't prove that a man is a saint and no hypocrite. Men must do more than carnal men to prove that they have grace: Mat. 5.20. <HI>Except your righteousness do ex∣ceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pha∣rises, you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> That which is common to hypo∣crites is no sign of saintship. It is a vain thing to make that a plea, that <HI>Publicans</HI> may plead as well as they, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.46, 47. That which may rise from a corrupt principle, will not prove a gracious principle; that which a beast may do, will not prove a thing to be a man.</P>
<P N="2">2. He cannot prove it from any such acts of Providence as are common to carnal men. Some men have smiling providences and great deliverances. God is very bountiful; and many argue from thence that they are godly; but they don't argue strongly: God may
<PB N="83" REF="002072_0084_0FBB7B43B96471A0"/>
smile on men here, and frown on them in the day of Judgment. Jude 5. <HI>The Lord having saved the people out of the Land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed them who believed not.</HI> Prosperity is no sign of the <HI>true Church,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of mens being members of the mystical Church. So, if God do the thing for men that they pray for, that is no argument: Ma∣ny prayers are granted that are not accepted. God hears the cry of the <HI>Ravens:</HI> God heard the voice of <HI>Ishmael.</HI> Sometimes God denies men's prayers because they ask amiss, but not always. Men may be instruments of a great deal of good in the Church, and in the com∣mon wealth; yet be destitute of grace. <HI>Saul</HI> did a great deal of service in <HI>Israel,</HI> 2 Sam. 1.24. <HI>Ministers</HI> may be instruments of the conversion of sinners and the comfort of saints, yet not be godly. There were several godly in <HI>Israel</HI> under the ministry of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees;</HI> and the <HI>Ravens</HI> brought meat to <HI>Elijah.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They don't know it by <HI>believing that they are godly.</HI> We know many things <HI>by faith:</HI> Heb. 11.1. <HI>By faith we understand that the worlds were made by the power of God. Faith is the evidence of things not seen,</HI> Heb. 11.1. Thus men know the Trinity of Persons in the Godhead; that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; that he that believes in him will have eternal life; the resurrection of the dead. And if God should tell a saint that he hath
<PB N="84" REF="002072_0085_0FBB7B44D364E3B8"/>
Grace, he might know it by believing the word of God. But it is not in this way that godly men do know that they have grace: It is not revealed in the word; and the Spi∣rit of God doth not testifie it to particular persons.</P>
<P>Some think the Spirit doth testify it to some; and they ground it on Rom. 8.16. <HI>The Spirit it self beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.</HI> They think the spirit reveals it by giving an inward testimony to it. And some godly men think they have had experience of it; but they may easily mistake. When the spirit of God doth eminently stir up a spirit of faith, and sheds abroad the love of God in the heart, it is easy to mistake it for a testimony. And that is not the meaning of <HI>Paul</HI>'s words. The <HI>Spirit</HI> reveals things to us, by opening our eyes to see what is revealed in the word: But the spirit doth not reveal new truths not revealed in the word. The Spirit discovers the grace of God in Christ, and thereby draws forth special actings of faith and love, which are evidential; but it doth not work in way of testimony. If God do but help us to re∣ceive the revelations in the word, we shall have comfort enough without new revela∣tions.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI>'s meaning is, that the miraculous works of the Spirit are a witness to the Christian Religion. The thing that is witnes∣sed
<PB N="85" REF="002072_0086_0FBB7B464D8DB618"/>
to is, that <HI>sincere Christians are the children of God;</HI> that the Christian religion is the true religion; and that all that embrace it indeed are the heirs of eternal life: And the Person that witnesseth is the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> he testifies to it by <HI>Miracles</HI> and <HI>extraordina∣ry Gifts.</HI> The mighty works of the Spirit of God in the primitive times, were evidences of the truth of the Christian religion; they were wrought for that very end. Heb. 2.4. <HI>God also bearing them witness with signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</HI> 1 Thes. 1.5. <HI>Our gospel came unto you, not in word only, but also in pow∣er, and in much assurance, and in the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is <HI>by Intuition or seeing of grace in their own hearts.</HI> It is by consciousness; as <HI>Peter</HI> knew his love to Christ, when he says, <HI>Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee,</HI> Joh. 11.17. And as <HI>David</HI> knew his love to God; Psal. 116.1. <HI>I love the Lord,</HI> And as <HI>Job</HI> knew his repentance; Job. 42.6. <HI>I abhor my self in dust and ashes.</HI> And as <HI>Paul</HI> knew that he <HI>knew Christ;</HI> 1 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I know whom I have believed.</HI> There is a reflecting power in man: As he can look out and see external objects, so he can <HI>look in,</HI> and see his <HI>own actions.</HI> In this manner saints know the <HI>corrupt workings</HI> of their own hearts: They know their pride, and worldliness, and
<PB N="86" REF="002072_0087_0FBB7B47C2F7B848"/>
frowardness, and unbelief; so they know their grace. In this manner they know their natural actions; they know that they think, and what they think about; they know the acts of their Wills, what they chuse, and what they refuse; and the acts of their Affections; they know that they love their children; that they desire meat and drink; that they are afraid of pain and death; that they rejoyce in their good things: So, they may have the knowledge by intuition, that they know God and Christ; that they re∣ceive the gospel; that they love God and the saints; that they are sorry for their sins. A godly man understanding what it is to love God and to repent, tho' he cannot give an exact definition of them, yet may be able by his observation to know that he doth so; and may be as able to say, that he loves God, and believes in Christ, as to say, he has pride and worldliness in his own heart. There may indeed be something of more diffi∣culty in it, because many actings of grace are low and weak; on that account it may be hard to see it; as it is hard to see the motion of water in a river, when it moves very slowly; and upon that account, because <HI>grace is much counterfeited;</HI> and there be many actings that do look like the actings of grace that are not so: But sometimes grace works so powerfully, that it is <HI>very vi∣sible;</HI> and men are able to distinguish between
<PB N="87" REF="002072_0088_0FBB7B49545BBB20"/>
grace and the resemblances of it, and be satis∣fyed understandingly: 1 Chron. 29.17. <HI>As for me, in the uprightness of my heart, I willingly offered all these things.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, it may be of great use for <HI>Ministers</HI> frequently to be giving <HI>signs of Grace.</HI> These signs are of great use for the discovery of hypocrisy. The want of particular graces is a means to discover some. Some may be undeceived by considering, that they have not had an antecedent work of <HI>Humiliation.</HI> The account of the way where∣in God works grace, <HI>sc.</HI> by the <HI>discoveries of Gospel Grace,</HI> may convince others. The want of <HI>Obedience</HI> may convince others. So, the allowing of pride or worldliness, and the want of doing duties out of regard to God's glory.</P>
<P>But <HI>Signs</HI> also are of great use for the in∣couragement and strengthening of the saints. Sometimes the discoursing of such things doth draw forth the exercise of grace; and men find in themselves that which they are hearing of. So it was with <HI>Peter:</HI> The very question whether he loved Christ kindled a spirit of love to him, that he was assured <HI>that he loved him,</HI> Joh. 21.17 Sometimes the explication of the sign, helps men to see it more clearly. They were at a loss; but when it is clearly laid open, it helps them to see it. Besides, it brings to remembrance what they formerly felt; and so it brings joy, and
<PB N="88" REF="002072_0089_0FBB7B4DC1AB98D8"/>
renews their comfort. Moreover, it helps them against many temptations: They are un∣der fears because of the Providence of God, and because of corrupt workings of heart; but when they hear that complacency in God, and the sight of the glory of Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are signs of a good estate, that satisfys them, and is a relief to them under their tempta∣tions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> The Grace given in Conversion is im∣perfect.</HEAD>
<P>THe grace given in conversion, like other qualities, doth admit of innumerable <HI>degrees;</HI> and is very imperfect in the best of the people of God. Godly men are far from pretending to perfection: Job. 9.20. <HI>If I say I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</HI> Hence we find lamentations of some of the choicest men that have been in the world: Prov. 30. <HI>Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</HI> Rom. 7.23, 24. <HI>I see another law in my mem∣bers, bringing me into captivity. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> The sorrowful <HI>falls</HI> of <HI>David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Jonah, Peter,</HI> are sufficient demonstrations of this; and that
<PB N="89" REF="002072_0090_0FBB7B51AC6E6B90"/>
<HI>warfare</HI> that every godly man doth experi∣ence: Gal. 5.17. <HI>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other: So that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</HI> Especial∣ly, grace at first conversion is very small; if after twenty or thirty years growth, it is very defective, it must needs be very small at first.</P>
<P>There may be many reasons why God suffers much sin to remain in his people, while they remain in this world.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>the work of sanctification may be so carried on, that they may be in continual need of Justification and Pardon.</HI> The pardoning of the sins that men committed in their uncon∣verted state, is a great manifestation of the riches of his grace, and the virtue of the blood of Jesus Christ; but God doth day by day pardon the repeated iniquities of his peo∣ple; forgives men thousands of times, tho' they have abused mercy, broken vows, fallen from resolutions: This doth wonderfully commend the grace of God, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. If there were not experience of it, it would be difficult to conceive that God would be willing so to do. These are mighty instances of the unsearchable depth of mercy that is in the heart of God; and lead men to say, as Mic. 2.18. <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of
<PB N="90" REF="002072_0091_0FBB7B5310224790"/>
his heritage, and retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because they live among carnal men,</HI> scat∣tered up and down among unconverted men; and if this their Grace were perfect, they would not be fit to live together; it would be known who were godly and who ungodly, which would fill <HI>Families, Towns</HI> and <HI>Coun∣tries</HI> with <HI>Temptation:</HI> Godly Men would be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it to bear the carriages of the ungodly, and ungodly men would not know how to bear the carriages of the Godly; it would fill all societies with disquietment and trou∣ble.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because <HI>this is suitable to those Admini∣strations that God has appointed in his House.</HI> It is meet that all should worship God; and the <HI>worship</HI> that God has appointed is suited both for the conversion of sinners, and the building up of saints; to promote their humi∣liation and recovery from backslidings and releif under temptations. If godly men were perfect, they and ungodly men would not be fit to joyn together in <HI>confession</HI> or <HI>petition.</HI> The <HI>Ordinances</HI> that God has appointed are not not fit to be attended by men that have at∣tained to a <HI>perfection in Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Some saints do attain to greater perfection in grace than others; this is not always in proportion to the time since their conversion, but according to the improvement of their time: It is said of the <HI>Thessalonians</HI> that their
<PB N="91" REF="002072_0092_0FBB7B54839D3B60"/>
<HI>faith grew exceedingly, and their Charity a∣bounded.</HI> 2 Thes. 1.3. Some have more grace at first Conversion than others, and some may grow more in a <HI>Year</HI> than others in <HI>Seven,</HI> and though it would be a presumptu∣ous thing to determine the degree of Grace any have attained to in this life, yet it seems probable that Saints do not ordinarily, if ever attain to such measures of grace, but that they have more corruption than grace.</P>
<P>It seems to be but a little grace compared with corruption that God's choice servants do attain unto. It is said of the <HI>angel of Philadelphia, Thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word and hast not denyed my name.</HI> Rev. 3.8. And the Experience of the people of God seems to confirm this: <HI>Sin doth easily beset them;</HI> Heb. 12.1. Corruption is like a fountain that is continually sending forth its waters. Temptations do quickly infect. Pride and worldliness and discontent and un∣belief are very ready to work; and there is a great backwardness to spiritual duties, to faith and love, and to submit to the sove∣reignty of God. Men's enjoyments are so dear to them, that they have great difficulty to re∣sign them up to the pleasure of God. There is much <HI>formality</HI> that doth attend duties of religion; and there is much spiritual blind∣ness, ignorance of God and Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Neither doth it make against this assertion, that some of the people of God have <HI>a very
<PB N="92" REF="002072_0093_0FBB7B59273673C0"/>
exemplary Conversation;</HI> for there are many <HI>other principles</HI> that joyn in with grace to effect this; natural conscience, regard to reputati∣on, a good temper, principles of morality, hope of reward and fear of punishment. If an exemplary conversation were an argument that men had more grace than corruption, how comes it about that some men that have not one spark of Grace do carry exemplarily? A good conversation is sometimes only the effect of nature improved.</P>

<HEAD>USE.</HEAD>
<P>The USE of this discourse is of EXHOR∣TATION, <HI>to labour to be converted.</HI> Con∣version is a glorious change, and will issue in eternal Glory. You may observe many men striving with all their might to add to their worldly comforts: they spare no pains, but are laying out themselves indefatigably to mend their accomodations, and increase their Enjoyments here; but it will turn to better account for you to labour after a work of <HI>Regeneration.</HI> I don't advise you to effect it, for it is beyond your power. When the <HI>Prophet</HI> said, <HI>Make ye a new heart and a new Spirit, for why will ye die O house of Israel,</HI> he intends that the Nation should get a dispositi∣on to <HI>reform.</HI> But tho' you can't effect this your selves, you can <HI>labour</HI> in it: You may not indulge your selves in negligence, excu∣sing

yourselves from your <HI>impotency:</HI> God expects that you should <HI>strive to enter into the strait gate,</HI> Luk. 12.24. That you <HI>press into the kingdom of God, and be violent</HI> that you may obtain it. It is well worth your while to be engaged in this matter, and to give your selves no rest until you are converted. If God gives you many outward comforts, let not them satisfy you; but cry out, that one thing is wanting: <HI>What will it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own Soul,</HI> Mat. 16.21. Some content themselves with the reputation of being converted; but it is not the <HI>name</HI> but the <HI>thing,</HI> that you must crave. Some things are to be sought with a great deal of indifferency; this must be sought with <HI>agony of Spirit;</HI> you must <HI>cry for wisdom, and lift up your voice for understanding, you must seek it as silver, search for it as for hid treasures,</HI> Prov. 2.34. This is a thing of such necessity, that you may not delay to strive after it; and whatever occasions you have, you must allow of no excuse; and what ever difficulties you meet with, you must ne∣ver be discouraged. If others should faint, you must hold out. Avoid every thing that has a tendency to hinder Success: Shun all things that will stupify or divert, or discou∣rage; and practise every thing that is proper and serviceable to your conversion. Don't think much to deny your pleasures, to forgo lawful Liberties, to let slip worldly opportu∣nities,

<P N="1">1. <HI>A Natural Condition is a very sinful Con∣dition.</HI> Unconverted men are ungodly men. There be but those two sorts of men in the World, Godly and Ungodly. All ungodly men are utterly destitute of holiness; their natures are corrupted, they are servants of Sa∣tan, and live in a way of Rebellion against G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. In <HI>this respect</HI> they are <HI>worse than the beasts of the Earth;</HI> their natures are superior, but they are more corrupt than brute crea∣tures. Upon this account they are vile in the eyes of God: If any of them be in an ho∣nourable station outwardly; yet they are abo∣minable to God. Some think that God takes delight in them because of his bounty to them; but they are mistaken; God looks on them as filthy and abominable; and they are a continual provocation to God. Psal. 7.11. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Your <HI>hearts are full of sin.</HI> Some men carry themselves more orderly and religiously than others; but their hearts are desperately wicked: Eccl. 9.3. The hearts of the sons of men are full of Evil. Some are under grea∣ter divine restraints than others are; but the same abominations that break out in other men, are in them; they have the seeds of all
<PB N="95" REF="002072_0096_0FBC1BE3F148AF18"/>
wickedness in them; <HI>the natural mind is en∣mity against God,</HI> Rom. 8.7. They are ene∣mies to the authority of God, and to the wis∣dom, and power, and justice of God; year to the very <HI>being of God.</HI> They have a prepared∣ness to all that wickedness that is perpetrated in the world, if God did not restrain them: <HI>As face answereth to face in water, so doth the heart of man to man.</HI> Many times if they be told before hand what workings of heart they should have, they would say as <HI>Hazael, Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?</HI> If they were in <HI>Cains</HI> circumstances, and God should suffer them, they would do as bad as he did. If they were in <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> circumstances, and left of God, they would be as cruel, false and hard-hearted as he. If they were in the like circumstances with <HI>Doeg,</HI> though they condemn him for his hypocrisy, flattery and cruelty, they would do every whit as bad as he. If they were in the like circumstances as <HI>Judas</HI> was, whatever indignation they have against him, they would be as false, and im∣pudent, and as very traitors as he. Yea, if they were under the circumstances that the <HI>fallen Angels</HI> are, they would be as <HI>very Devils</HI> as they. A <HI>Serpent</HI> when benumme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with cold, is a Serpent still. A <HI>Lion</HI> in a grate is the same fierce creature that he was before. A <HI>Swine</HI> that is washed is a Swine still, Some of them have a regular conversation; but a spirit of uncleaness, and intemperance, and
<PB N="96" REF="002072_0097_0FBB7B5F0D97ACE0"/>
profaness, and atheism, and blasphemy is not mortifyed. That original sin that reigns in every natural man is the fountain of every abomination. Every natural man is over-run with the leprosy of sin from head to foot; has not one spark of goodness in him; all his fa∣culties are corrupted utterly. His Under∣standing is blind: He talks of God, but is quite a stranger to him. His Will is misera∣bly corrupted: He prefers vain and base things before God. All his Affections are quite out of order: His whole Soul is like a dead car∣cass, like an heap of carrion, loathsom and noisom, and God may justly abhor him; which evidently shews a great necessity of his con∣version.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Your lives are full of sin.</HI> Men in their natural condition are guilty of a world of sin. Some of them live in a way of profaness: They <HI>see their mouth against the heavens,</HI> Psal. 73.9. Some live in ways of sensuality, and wallow like swine in the mire. Some live in ways of injustice; they are beasts of prey. Some are meer earth-worms, seeking an hea∣ven upon the earth: They are under the curse of the serpent; <HI>Dust shall be the serpents meat.</HI> And such of them as are addicted to morali∣ty and religion, are serving their lusts therein. The most orderly natural men do live an un∣godly life. In all the <HI>works of their calling</HI> they carry themselves sinfully; Prov. 21.4. <HI>The ploughing of the wicked is sin.</HI> In all their
<PB N="97" REF="002072_0098_0FBB7B60877DB980"/>
<HI>relations</HI> they carry themselves sinfully. Un∣der all <HI>Providences</HI> they live ungodly. When they eat and drink, they do it not as they should, for God's Glory; but are eating and drinking damnation to themselves. Yea, their very <HI>Religion</HI> is iniquity, <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.5. Their hearts are set upon carnal things; Rom. 8.5. <HI>They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh.</HI> Though some of them whose conscien∣ces are inlightned, are reforming their lives, and crying to God for the pardon of sin, yet they are minding carnal things as well as others; they are setting up their own righ∣teousness, and nourishing the pride of their spirits, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. And they dont mind the spiritual, but the bodily enjoyments o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hea∣ven. They pray for holiness but op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose it. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.42. <HI>They have not the love of God in them.</HI> They praise God because of his excel∣lency, but they don't believe him to be such an one; it is a burden to them that they sus∣pect it, and they wish he were not such an one. They wish God did not see their hearts, and had not power to avenge himself. There is no∣thing but hypocrisy in all that they do. They confess their sins, and bewail their iniquities, but they have no godly sorrow. They put up earnest requests for holiness, but dont sincerely desire it. They strive against sin, and all the while are cherishing of it. They have pangs of affection▪ but no love. They have some affection to saints, but hate real holiness.
<PB N="98" REF="002072_0099_0FBB7B624422F5C0"/>
They are zealous against some sins, but hate none. They are striving for Salvation, but refuse the offers of it. Sometimes God tries them, by convincing them of the great danger of their damnation; and they shew a dreadful wicked and rebelli∣ous spirit, that they are scared to see them∣selves. There is a great deal of the spirit of the Devil in them: Upon this account there is great need of their conversion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If you be not converted, you will perish for ever.</HI> It may be God may bring great ca∣lamities on you in this world on on that ac∣count: He may curse you in your estate, in your body, or in your relations. It may be he may shorten your days: But however that be, you will be damned. If you live here among many that will go to heaven, yet you will go to hell. You may possibly enjoy ma∣ny good things here from the bounty of God; but you will not find mercy from the Lord <HI>in that day.</HI> You may flatter your selves with the hopes of heaven; but when your case comes to be determined, you will be sent to hell. Joh. 3.3. <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</HI> If you have other qualifications that are commendable and honourable, yet you will be rejected. Moral qualifications which heathens may attain to, will not prepare you for heaven. If you pi∣ty the poor, God will not pity you. If you shed many tears, that will not quench the
<PB N="99" REF="002072_0100_0FBB7B6391C963F8"/>
fire of God's wrath. You were born children of wrath; and if you continue in your natural condition, you will remain under the wrath of God. God will not take men to heaven that continue in a State of enmity to him. If the choicest men upon earth pray for your Salvation, God will not hear them. All un∣converted men are ungodly men. If they be honest men, if they be sober men, if they be religious men, if they be zealous, yet they are ungodly; and they shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world, if they be not converted, they are not pardoned, and there will be no place for them in heaven, Mat. 28.3. <HI>Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>And can you content your selves to be in a perishing condition? Can you stand still till the wrath of God overtake you? What will it signify for you to eat and drink, and get land and cattle, and spend away a few years after a troublesome manner; and then sink down into the bottomless Pit? A dying time will come; Can you think of it without horror? Dont it make you tremble to consi∣der it? Will it not be a burden too heavy for you? It is an awful thing to think of the damnation of neighbours; And can you bear the thoughts of your own damnation? One would think you should not be able to take any comfort in your choicest enjoyments,
<PB N="100" REF="002072_0101_0FBB7B65E87DA960"/>
because it is like to be your portion at last to lie down in sorrow. Dont you think that <HI>Cain,</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> and the sinners in the old world were in a doleful estate; and are you willing to be one among the rest? Can you bear to hear that sentence, Mat. 24.1. <HI>Depart ye cursed,</HI> &amp;c. Is not the wrath of God too heavy for you? Is not hell fire too hot for you? You shun reproach, you avoid pain, you hate poverty; and are you able to bear hell? When you come to lie in torment, can you satisfy your self that you have had your good things? Will you be able to ap∣plaud your self as having acted the part of a wise man? Will you glory in your wisdom, and bless your self for loitering away your time? One hours experience of the pains of hell will effectually teach you that peace with God is worth your care and labour; and that working out your Salvation is no intollera∣ble burden. If the <HI>Doctrine of Hell</HI> be a dream, if when you died your soul would be resolved into it's first principles, if there were no hell but only in the imaginations of doting men, you might bless your self in your way: But if there be a God in heaven that will execute vengeance upon ungodly men, your neglecting to get into a converted condition is highest madness, and folly: You act like the man possessed with the devil, that cast himself sometimes into the fire, and sometimes into the water. One would think that you should be saying to your self as they, Isai. 33.14. <HI>Who
<PB N="101" REF="002072_0102_0FBB7B68C3D5EB18"/>
among us can dwell with the devouring fire?</HI> Am I patient enough, am I strong enough, am I stout enough to bear everlasting Burnings? Are you more hardy than the devils, who <HI>be∣lieve and tremble?</HI> When men are in great pains, they hope that they will abate after a while: When they have sorrows, they hope for a change after a while: But what will you have to comfort you, when your miseries are everlasting? When death shall come up∣on you, can you bid it welcome? You had rather be turned into nothing than turned into hell. Is it not better to take pains that you may escape, than loiter away your time, till de∣struction comes upon you like an armed man?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If you be converted, God will bestow eter∣nal life upon you?</HI> If a man be indeed con∣verted, yet he may have great afflictions in this world. Though God many times rewards men with outward blessings, yet that is a more arbitrary way, and he mixes many afflicti∣ons with them. So it was with <HI>Jacob,</HI> and <HI>Job, and David;</HI> but converted men shall have eternal life. He will bestow some other things of great consequence upon them: He will hear their prayers, accept their services, and have communion with them; and at last he will bestow eternal life upon them. Jam. 5.20. <HI>He that converteth a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death.</HI> Act. 3.19. <HI>Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>freshing
<PB N="102" REF="002072_0103_0FBB7B6D24D69A60"/>
shall come from the presence of the Lord,</HI> Act. 26.18. <HI>To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God, that they may receive the forgiveness of sins, and an in∣heritance among them that are sanctifyed.</HI> Af∣ter they are converted, they may do that which is very provoking to God, and God may exe∣cute fatherly anger upon them; but they shall not miss of eternal life thereby; there is no falling from a state of Adoption, or Justifica∣tion. Conversion will issue in <HI>Glorification.</HI> Joh. 4.14. <HI>The water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water, spinging up into eternal life.</HI> It is a great thing to go to hea∣ven; but this shall be the portion of all that are converted. The generality of men shall fall short of heaven, but no converted man shall fall short. Wealthy men, and gifted men, and honourable men, and religious men may; but converted men shall not: Rom. 8.30. <HI>Whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</HI></P>
<P>And can you content your selves to lose such a benefit? If your Salvation be secured, then you may bless your self, you may rejoyce in hope of the glory of God. If you be under affliction, if you hear of wars and troubles, you may say as <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 46.1, 2. <HI>The Lord is my strength and refuge, a present help in time of trouble, therefore will I not fear, though the earth be removed.</HI> When you look into the Bible, there you may read your title.
<PB N="103" REF="002072_0104_0FBB7B6E15C55188"/>
When you hear the word, you will hear abun∣dant matter of consolation. When you are ex∣ercised with your corruptions, you may com∣fort your selves with that, after a while Christ will present you <HI>without spot or ble∣mish.</HI> When <HI>Satan</HI> is tempting, you may re∣joice in that, <HI>God will tread satan under your feet shortly.</HI> When you mourn under the withdrawings of God, you may be refreshed with that consideration, that ere long you shall <HI>behold his face in righteousness.</HI> When you are afflicted with your ignorance, you may rejoice in that you shall be <HI>wise like the An∣gels of God.</HI> When you are afflicted with a dull, crazy, distempered body, you may remem∣ber to your comfort, that Christ will <HI>change your vile body, and make it like to his own most glorious body.</HI> You desire such and such earth∣ly comforts, but you have reason to be more indifferent about those; they will not make you happy if you have them; and the want of them will not make you miserable. Can you be contented to have your portion in this life, and that others have heaven and eternal glory? Christ has died for the Salvation of sinners; God has appointed ordinances to per∣swade men to be saved, and is it not worth the while for you to labour in it? If you get into a state of salvation, you shall not need to be afraid of death; death that is a terror to the princes of this world need be no terror to you: You may look upon it as a conque∣red

enemy: You may say, <HI>O death, where is thy sting, O grave, where is thy victory!</HI> Don't make too much of your pains and trouble in striving for conversion; heaven will make a∣mends for all. Men that are rejoicing in world∣ly things, <HI>walk in a vain shew;</HI> but heaven is not a little thing. It is a wonder that God don't say, it is too much to give heaven to such as we; we should be far from saying it is too little for us. It becomes you to say, let who will take the world, so you may obtain hea∣ven. There may be some joy in earthly things; but in <HI>God's presence is fulness of joy.</HI> They that enter into heaven, enter into the joy of <HI>their Lord.</HI> They are blessed, to whom it shall be said, <HI>Inherit the kingdom prepared for you.</HI> If it be good to have meat, and drink, and cloathing, to be <HI>with Christ is far better.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. There is <HI>much difficulty in the way of con∣version.</HI> Thus are we taught by Christ; Mat. 7.14. <HI>Strait is the Gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</HI> Indeed we read of some that have been converted on a sudden, that took no great pains to be converted; So the Jailor, <HI>Act.</HI> 16. the <HI>Woman of Samaria,</HI> Joh. 4. Many of the Gentiles; Acts 13. It may possibly be so now with <HI>Some</HI> on their sick beds; and therefore there is sufficient encouragement for <HI>Ministers</HI> to advise them, and pray for them. God can suddenly let in so much light as is sufficient for their Conversion. But if God do not won∣derfully
<PB N="105" REF="002072_0106_0FBB7B74DD4E1B10"/>
prevent it, ordinarily there is much difficulty in the way; and Christ Jesus makes that argument for men to labour after it. Luk. 3.14. <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait gate.</HI> There be abundance of difficulties in the way, so that except persons labour in it, they are never like to be converted: <HI>Many seek and and are not able to enter.</HI> Their <HI>Ignorance</HI> makes the work difficult; they are in great danger to take wrong paths; their reason misleads them, and they get out of the right way, and so make a great deal of work for themselves. Their <HI>love to carnal things</HI> makes the work difficult; there is much opposition from a <HI>worldly Spirit,</HI> that makes them dull and sluggish, that swallows up a great deal of time, that fills them full of care. Their <HI>Pride</HI> is a great hinderance; it fills with con∣ceits of their own sufficiency. Their <HI>fearful∣ness</HI> creates a great deal of difficulty, and they are ready to be discouraged. They have a great deal of <HI>frowardness;</HI> and they are ready to be disgusted and prejudiced. The blind∣ness of their minds hinders them from seeing their way. A Spirit of <HI>self love</HI> leads them in wrong paths. And Satan is laying many snares for them, works on their corruptions, and takes all occasions to strenghthen their lusts.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of difficulty in the way of <HI>Reformation.</HI> It is a great while some∣times before they will forsake their evil ways:
<PB N="106" REF="002072_0107_0FBB7B7843A282F0"/>
If they do many things like <HI>Herod,</HI> yet they stick at some particulars; they will bear ma∣ny a gird of Conscience before they will re∣form some things; they have their excuses and evasions. If they do throughly reform, and do duties of self denial, it is not brought about without a great deal of Terror. His mother's curse made <HI>Mical</HI> to reform his in∣justice; <HI>Judg.</HI> 17. They will not cast away their Idols of Gold without a great deal of terror. <HI>Isai.</HI> 2.20, 21. Many Persons deal ve∣ry deceitfully a great while about the work of reformation; they pretend to reformation when they are not throughly reformed; their moisture is turned into the drought of summer before they will comply.</P>
<P>And there is a great deal of difficulty in the work of <HI>Humiliation.</HI> They are called to come to Jesus Christ, but they will try other methods first, and go about to establish their own righteousness, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. They dare not venture upon Christ till they have made their hearts better. They say they are no Pa∣pists, yet they have great dependance upon their works. Sometimes they fancy they are converted, and please themselves that God is bound in faithfulness to pardon them upon Christ's account: Prov. 12.30. <HI>There is a ge∣neration that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleansed from their filthiness.</HI> Some∣times they think they have taken a great deal of pains, and done a great deal of service,
<PB N="107" REF="002072_0108_0FBB7B795CECC900"/>
and can't conceive that it is a fair thing for God to cast them off. It looks very hard for God to despise all they have done, and reject them: Isai. 58.3. <HI>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest us not? wherefore have we af∣flicted our souls, and thou takest no knowledge?</HI> So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>mes they take notice of the meltings of their heart, their desires of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their delight in sabbaths: And it seems to them as if God could not be very angry; as if they had melted the heart of God into com∣passions, and made him more easy, and willing to pardon them; as if God could not find in his heart to cast them off; as if their lamen∣tations could force the pity of God. And when their hearts appear worse, they nourish an hope to bring them to; and take a great deal of pains to work up such frames as may lay bonds on God to save them. They are told, that it is in the pleasure of God to be∣stow mercy or deny it; but they dread the thoughts of that, and try twenty conclusions before they will submit to God. They strive much to bring God under a necessity to save them. They make objections against God's prerogative: They strive to bring their hearts into a kind of submission, making a righte∣ousness of it; and would submit to prevent submission. There be so many difficulties in the way, that men had need be greatly con∣cerned, and be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orking out their salvation with fear and trembling.</HI> There is so much diffi∣culty,
<PB N="108" REF="002072_0109_0FBB7B7ADD08CCE0"/>
that many times it is long, and with great strugglings that they do obtain. Some never do obtain: After a great while they grow discouraged, think it is to no purpose, grow cool and indifferent, start some other design, and by degrees are intangled in the pollutions of the world again; they become like the salt that has lost its savour. Some persons set∣tle at length in a way of carnal confidence, build their hopes upon the sand. There be many Pharisaical Professors, that glory in themselves, and <HI>speak peace to themselves, when there is no peace.</HI> They are deceived with false appearances of love, and faith, and <HI>think themselves something, when they are nothing.</HI> Some others spend their days like <HI>Israel,</HI> in the <HI>wilderness;</HI> they wander about from mountain to hill, seeking rest and finding none: They beat upon the coast, but never enter into the harbour: They are striving, and death comes and puts an end to all their hopes. But those that get into a converted condition, have many difficulties to grapple with before they do obtain; and they are under a necessity to labour much in it. Mat. 11.12. <HI>The king∣dom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It is <HI>hopeful if you strive, that you may obtain.</HI> He that <HI>ploughs, ploughs in hope.</HI> If there were no hope of obtaining, men would not be prevailed with to seek. Hope made the king of <HI>Nineveh</HI> seek the savour of God,
<PB N="109" REF="002072_0110_0FBB7B7C5212C908"/>
<HI>Jonah</HI> 3.9. Despair kills the heart, and cramps the powers of nature, and makes men deaf to perswasions; but hope makes men pray, and strive, and run ventures, and endure hardship. Hopes of a cure makes the sick use medicines. Hopes of a harvest makes the husbandman to till his ground. Hopes of arriving at the port, makes the mariner hoist his sails. Hopes of victory makes the soldier fight. And God encourages men to seek him from the hopes of success. Isai, 55.6. <HI>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.</HI> Men are wont to give way to a discou∣raged spirit, partly from dark appearances, partly from frowardness, partly from sloth∣fulness: But they do very ill, for it is <HI>hope∣ful</HI> that they may obtain. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) God will bestow <HI>converting grace up∣on some.</HI> We are indeed assured that all will not obtain. We are also assured that some will obtain; for there are a number of men whose names are written in <HI>the book of life.</HI> There may be more of them in one age than in another, more of them in one professing country and town than in another; but all that are elected shall obtain, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.7. There is a number that are redeemed by Christ, that he did designedly shed his blood for: He laid <HI>down his life for his sheep,</HI> Joh. 10.15. God would never have sent him into the world, but that he designed to convert and save many sinners through him. He has promised to Je∣sus
<PB N="110" REF="002072_0111_0FBB7B7DCA7B3A40"/>
Christ the salvation of many; Isai. 49.6. <HI>I have given him to be a light unto the gentiles, and salvation to the ends of the earth.</HI> Psal. 72.17. <HI>Men shall be blessed in him, and all nations shall call him blessed.</HI> This is the promise spoken of, Tit. 1.2. <HI>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promised before the world began.</HI> God has made a donation of an eternal kingdom to Christ, Mat. 16, 18. <HI>The gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church.</HI> The work of conversion shall be carried on in all ages. Ordinances shall not be in vain; Mat. 28.19, 20. <HI>Go, teach all nations, baptizing them; and lo I am with you even to the end of the world.</HI> When God sends sowers to sow, <HI>some seed</HI> shall fall on <HI>good ground.</HI> The <HI>Gospel</HI> is as a <HI>Net</HI> that gathers some <HI>good fish, and some bad.</HI> As other great works of God are continued, so this work of conversion shall continue in all ages. Though satan has a kindom in the world, yet Christ will always have a kingdom here as well as he.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There is <HI>ground to hope that he will be∣stow converting grace on you.</HI> You are under the means of grace; accordingly the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the gospel should hope for you, and ac∣cordingly take pains with you: It would be a very sinful thing if they should be discoura∣ged about you, and neglect to teach, and warn, and direct you. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us that he warned all his hearers, <HI>Acts</HI> 20, 31. And as there is ground for the Minister to take encouragement
<PB N="111" REF="002072_0112_0FBB7B7F464A5A00"/>
to endeavour your conversion, so there is ground for you to be encouraged, to strive for your own conversion. If it were beyond the power of God to convert, or beyond the grace of God to pardon you, then you would have reason to be discouraged. Men may not ex∣pect impossibilities; but God can renew his image within you. The soul of a man is a suitable subject for grace; and as long as the faculties of the soul do remain, a capacity to be gracious doth remain. Your corruptions are accidental, and so may be mortifyed. Your mind can't be so blind, as to be incapable of light. Your heart cant be so hard as to be uncapable to be made soft. If your corrupti∣ons are very strong, omnipotency can overcome them. Mat. 19.26. <HI>With God all things are possible.</HI> Neither is it beyond the grace of God to pardon you. It is great folly to set limits to that which is infinite. God's grace exceeds man's sinfulness: His <HI>thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways;</HI> but high above them, as the heavens are above the earth. Indeed if God had revealed, that he would not pardon you, that would cut off all hope; but there is no such thing in the word. God says in his word, <HI>that his spirit should not always strive with flesh,</HI> Gen. 6.3. but that only signifys, that he would <HI>wait only an hun∣dred and twenty years, and then bring the flood.</HI> He says, that the heart of the people shall be <HI>made fat,</HI> Isai. 6.10. but that was a <HI>national Judgment;</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="002072_0113_0FBB7B85DCC54F88"/>
particular persons might be converted for all. Sometimes God sware concerning <HI>Israel,</HI> that they should not <HI>enter into his rest,</HI> Psal. 95.11. but there is no such thing said concerning you. God sometimes pronounces that curse, <HI>Let him that is unjust be unjust still, and him that is filthy be filthy still,</HI> Rev, 22.11. but he is using means with you still. You may take notice of some dark appearances in Pro∣vidence; that you are of such an age; that God has refused hitherto to hear your prayers; that in the days when many have heard the voice of the Son of God, you have been left; But it is unwarrantable and presumptuous, without Scripture or Reason, to draw any dark conclusions from thence.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) If <HI>you be striving, there is a great deal of hope that you will obtain.</HI> If men are stri∣ving, and will not be discouraged, it is very hopeful that they will in time be converted; especially if they be directed aright, and be not flattered; for diligent seeking is God's way: God's voice unto men is, <HI>Seek ye my face;</HI> Psal. 27.8. So, <HI>Seek the Lord and his face, seek his strength evermore;</HI> Psal. 105.4. There is hope that God will own men, when they take the directions of his word. Though natural men when they seek conversion, al∣ways do it with a selfish and hypocritical Spirit, and God don't accept it as service to himself; yet it is not strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should bless his own <HI>appointments.</HI> Indeed the seeking of
<PB N="113" REF="002072_0114_0FBB7B88820C75B8"/>
God diligently, reforming mens lives, search∣ing into the way of Salvation, has a great tendency to promote Salvation; for it takes them off from their sinful practices, and worldly designs that hindred them from get∣ting into the way of life. They are searching into those things that will conduce to their conversion. Besides, when men are earnestly seeking after that, it is a sign that the Spirit of God is at work with them: And the Spi∣rit is promised to make the means of Grace effectual. Joh. 16.7, 8. <HI>If I depart, I will send the Comforter to you; and when he is come he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteous∣ness, and of Judgment.</HI> And when he doth intend to convert, his way is, first to convince of sin; and when he doth convince of sin, many times it is in order to conversion. And indeed many persons have had experience that in a way of labouring after conversion, God has shewed mercy on them; while oth∣ers that have been careless and slighty, have continued in an unconverted condition. Ma∣ny that have been striving to enter in at the strait gate have obtained; and it is always so, that where there is in any place, an earnest desire to be seeking after peace with God, ma∣ny do obtain mercy; and if that spirit should continue longer, many more might obtain, ac∣cording to that, Mat. 11.12. <HI>The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="114" REF="002072_0115_0FBB7B89CDD171F0"/>6. If <HI>you should obtain conversion, you would not be in an unconverted estate again for all the world.</HI> A man that has a fair estate, may be very willing to exchange for another: But if you were converted, you will despise Lord∣ships and Principalities in comparison there∣of. The glory of the world might possibly be a temptation to you; but you would never be willing to change a converted estate for the glory of the world. When you called to mind the doleful condition of such men, you would look upon them objects of commi∣seration; their jollity, and wealth, and gran∣dure, would not reconcile you to their condi∣tion: You would remember the worm wood and the gall: You would think of the vani∣ty of their hopes, the dolefulness of their death, and their eternal confusion; and their state would be matter of horror to you. <HI>Je∣remiah</HI> dreaded to <HI>return to the house of Jona∣than.</HI> What ever enjoyments you had, pedi∣gree, estate, honourable offices; upon this ac∣count you would call your self happy, that you were converted. When you considered what it delivered you from, and what it did intitle you unto, you would say as the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks of peace with God, that it <HI>passes all understanding.</HI> Conversion opens a door to the richest treasures: He thinks with him∣self, What a comfort is it to have peace with God, to be delivered from the fear of death, to be provided for eternity? God is his, and
<PB N="115" REF="002072_0116_0FBB7B8B5B2A1230"/>
Christ is his, and heaven is his; he wishes it was so with others: Act. 26.29. <HI>I wish that others were such as I am, except th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se bonds.</HI> Men that obtain great things in the world are never contented; but when they are con∣verted, they say, it is enough. You would say, others eat the fat, and drink the sweet; some have great incomes, some have honou∣rable offices, some have glittering attire; but as <HI>David</HI> says, Psal. 17.15. <HI>As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness, I shall be sa∣tisfyed when I awake with thy likeness.</HI></P>

<P>GOdliness is a thing of great concern∣ment. The acceptance of services, the hearing of prayers, and the salvation of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul doth depend upon it. And because it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f such moment, the comfort of men doth much depend upon the knowledge of it. But there is a great
<PB N="118" REF="002072_0119_0FBB7B9212E1F048"/>
deal of darkness in the minds of men about it. Many times godly men have scruples, and sometimes great fears, that they are not god∣ly: They often set in judgment on themselves, and are at a loss what sentence to pronounce. And some ungodly men have great hopes that they are in a good estate, and steal comfort that dont belong to them. Some can't see their way to condemn themselves, and some give judgment for themselves. But the Apostle doth here direct the one sort and the other in the determination of their con∣dition. First, he tells us how a godly man may know his godliness: He that sees the workings of the grace of love in himself; he that sees more or fewer actings of that grace, may conclude for himself, that he is born of God, hath had a work of regeneration, the gospel has had a saving efficacy on his heart, he has the spiritual knowledge of God, his eyes have been opened to see the glory of God. Secondly, he tells us how hypocrites may know their hypocrisy: He that loveth not, that liveth in the omission of love, that hath nothing of the working of that spirit, that lives in the neglect of it, hath not the spiritual knowledge of God; whatever pre∣tences he makes, this casts the case against him. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we may say with respect to every other grace: He that believeth on Jesus Christ, that loveth God, that has godly sorrow, is born of God: But he that doth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="119" REF="002072_0120_0FBB7B950AE8A9E0"/>
believe in Christ, that loveth not God, that hath not godly sorrow, knoweth not God, whatever profession he maketh.</P>

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> Men may know their Hypocrisy only by their Course of life; but their Sincerity only by particular Acts.</HEAD>
<P>There are two sorts of professors, saints and hypocrites.

<HEAD><HI>PROP. I.</HI> Hypocrisy is to be known only by their Course of life. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> only by their walk.</HEAD>
<P>For the clearing of this, Consider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="120" REF="002072_0121_0FBB7B9869697890"/>I. <HI>Particular Acts</HI> of sin are no evidence of hypocrisy.</P>
<P N="1">1. Many <HI>internal acts</HI> of sin, are no evidence of Hypocrisy. Every godly man has a cor∣rupt principle remaining in him, and that principle don't lie still; but is busy and active. Tho' it be mortifyed, yet it is full of life, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Lay aside every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset us.</HI> It is like a foun∣tain, always springing up. Gal. 5.17. <HI>The flesh lusts against the spirit.</HI> Rom. 7.21. <HI>I find a law, that when I would do good, evil is pre∣sent with me.</HI> The choicest saints do find every day the stirrings of corruption. If they are alone, if they are in company, if they are in the works of their calling, if they are exer∣cising themselves in the duties of religion, they are always haunted with a corrupt heart. They have a multiude of evil thoughts, desires, delights, fears, sorrows. Unbelief is often stirring; so pride and worldliness, froward∣ness and envy. There be many stirrings of sin that they dont perceive; but abundance that falls under their observation. A corrupt principle will stir upon all occasions; every thing that occurs will awaken it: Therefore saints are warned to keep their hearts with all diligence. <HI>Prov.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 33. And godly men have great occasion every day to repent, and to say as <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 7.2 <HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death!</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="121" REF="002072_0122_0FBB7B9990EB4898"/>2. Many <HI>external acts of Sin</HI> are no evidence of Hypocrisy. Men have much more com∣mand of their words and outward actions than of their thoughts, and the inward workings of their hearts: Yet godly men are often guil∣ty of external sins: They commit many sins in words, Jam. 3.8. <HI>The tongue is an unruly evil.</HI> Many times their words savour of va∣nity, pride, unbelief, and uncontentedness. And they are often guilty of other external sins, Psal. 19.12. <HI>Who can understand his er∣rors?</HI> Every corruption is running them into transgression; sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omitting duty, sometimes committing sin. They are guilty of many sins of ignorance. Men that under∣stand general rules, often fail in applying them to particular cases. There be many proud, worldly, froward carriages that they are not aware of, and are ready to justify▪ And many sins are committed thro' innad∣vertency; they are hurried thro' fear, or passion, or pride, and consider nor at the time, but presently after they see it, and are sorry for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. An <HI>act of gross transgression</HI> is no evi∣dence. Gross transgressions are not the <HI>ordina∣ry spots</HI> of God's chrildren; but grace is no certain preservation from them. Mortifyed corruption may run a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> trans∣gression as many natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were never guil∣ty of. Gross transgression <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of such a nature that they seem to be inconsistent with grace:
<PB N="122" REF="002072_0123_0FBB7B9B287D8250"/>
But as a man that has corruption in him may do choice acts of holiness, so a man that has grace in him may commit gross acts of sin. If a man's nature be much weakened, yet in a fit he may act very strongly: So, if mens corruptions be much weakened, yet they may have fits wherein they may act very power∣fully. It is an idle thing to think, that such things are impossible as several times have come to pass. <HI>Noah</HI>'s intemperance, <HI>Lot</HI>'s in∣cest, <HI>David</HI>'s adultery, <HI>Peter</HI>'s denying of Christ, are unanswerable arguments, that gross trans∣gression is no evidence of an Hypocrite. It is no wonder if a gross transgression should make a man suspect his godliness, but it is no evi∣dence. If God withdraw from a godly man, his grace will not prevent gross transgression. Natural conscience doth often preserve men, but grace doth not always preserve men from gross sin.</P>
<P N="2">II. A <HI>Course of sin</HI> is an evidence of hypo∣crisy. If a man makes a profession of religion, and lives in a way of sin against the light of his conscience, he is an hypocrite. He that makes a profession, and contradicts it in his conversation, is an hypocrite. Tit. 1.16. <HI>They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at pretends to godliness, and turns aside to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooked ways, is an hypo∣crite; for those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e really godly do live in a way of obedience. Psal. 119.1, 2, 3. <HI>Blessed
<PB N="123" REF="002072_0124_0FBB7B9E10629098"/>

<HI>Phineas,</HI> they are called <HI>sons of Belial, that knew not the Lord,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.12. The foundation of their censure was their profaness and unclean∣ness, <HI>v.</HI> 13, 14, 22.

Thus <HI>Judas</HI> appeared to be an hypocrite, because he lived in theft, Joh. 12.6. <HI>He was a thief.</HI> That shewed the rotteness of the heart of <HI>Demas,</HI> that he was an Apostate, 2 Tim. 4.10. <HI>Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present evil world.</HI> To live impeni∣tently in any outward known sin, will cast the case against a man, and prove him a hy∣pocrite.</P>
<P N="2">2. A course of <HI>internal sin</HI> proves a man to be an hypocrite. Tho' he washes his hands, if he does not cleanse his heart, he is ungodly. The external conversation of some hypocrites may excell the conversation of some saints; but if there be a way of internal sin, their pre∣tences to godliness are vain. There be two sorts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which men may live in a way of, and is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tness against them. One is, a way of corrupt thoughts and affections: If men allow themselves in malice, envy, wan∣ton

thoughts, profane thoughts, that will condemn them: Though those corruptions do not break out in any scandalous way, those thoughts are an evidence of a rotten heart. Tit. 3.3. <HI>We our selves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</HI> If a man allows him∣self, though he thinks he doth not, in malice or envy, he is an hypocrite; tho' his consci∣ence disallows it, yet if his heart allows it he is no saint; if he dont hate and mortify those corrupt affections, he is no saint. The other way of living in internal sin is, to live in the omission of spiritual duties: Whether a man knows it or knows it not, it is an evidence of hypocrisy. Many men that make a fair shew, dont believe in Jesus Christ: They have a perswasion of the truth of the gospel, they hope Christ will save them, they have had some joy in hearing the gospel, but they don't believe in Christ; either they are carnally confident, or discouraged: This doth con∣demn them. <HI>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him,</HI> Joh. 3.36. He that is contentious, and obeys not the gospel will be condemned, Rom. 2.8.

of the Jews, Joh 5.42. <HI>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</HI> If men be zealous men, have tenderness of conscience, delight in sabbaths, but are desti∣tute of love to God, they are hypocrites. So, if there be not a spirit of love to saints, 1 Cor. 13.23. <HI>If I speak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal,</HI> So, 1 Joh. 4.8. <HI>He that loveth not, knoweth not God.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Saints may certainly see particular acts of Grace.</HI> Though there be many acts of grace that a man doth not know to be such, yet some acts of grace are plain to be seen. We find Christ enquiring of one whether he did believe, Joh. 9.35. <HI>Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</HI> and of another whether he lo∣ved him, Joh. 21.16. <HI>Simon son of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>as, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vest thou me?</HI> That shews that such things may be known, else to what purpose would it be to ask those questions. And reason shews that they may be seen, for they do greatly differ from all counterfeit acts, and sometimes grace acts very strongly and apparently. And we have an account in Scripture of saints that have spoken very confidently about the work∣ings of a spirit of grace; so <HI>Job,</HI> Job 42.5, 6. <HI>Now mine eye seeth thee, wherefore I abhor my self in dust and ashes.</HI> He saw the mighty workings of a spirit of repentance, and was at no loss about it. So <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 116.1. <HI>I love the Lord.</HI> He speaks of it as of a thing he was assured of. The like workings of heart he found towards the law, Psal. 119.97. <HI>O how love I thy law.</HI> So, <HI>Peter</HI> appeals to Christ, who knew his heart, Joh. 21.17. <HI>Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.</HI> And others have had the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>

I take it for granted, that there are not two men in ten thousand, that have just the same experience. More generally, godly men do hope and think, that they exercise grace many times every day, in their prayers, and in their cal∣ings, and in their conversation with men; but it is but now and then that they can cer∣tainly speak up to it. There be great mix∣tures of corruption with grace, there be many false appearances of grace, which makes them afraid whether they did indeed exercise grace; and this makes it evident, that it is thus with Saints, that many of them are for a long time under doubt whether they be in∣deed godly; thence we have these precepts, 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Give all diligence to make your calling and election sure.</HI> 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Exa∣mine your selves, whether you be in the Faith.</HI> Some hypocrites are a great deal more confi∣dent than many saints. Many godly men are at a loss whether their faith be any other than what unconverted men may have. And so a∣bout their other graces; there be some saints that have assurance, but the foundation of it is, that now and then they see the plain act∣ings of faith and love, and repentance. They see something of encouragement from their daily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But that which begets assu∣rance is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>etimes they plainly see Grace.</P>

Godly men are described to be men that walk in a course of holiness. Psal. 119.1. <HI>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, that walk in the law of the Lord.</HI> And we find that godly men have been well satisfyed that they have walked in a way of holiness. Isai. 39.3. <HI>Remember, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy fight.</HI> If it be enquired, how they do know that their obedience is not the fruit of natu∣ral conscience and common grace, as it is with many others: The Answer is, that they see now and then the plain exercises of grace, and from thence conclude, that they are under the in∣fluence of a gracious spirit in their walk; that though they be guilty of much formali∣ty and hypocrisy, yet there is a spirit of holi∣ness working in them, and an hearty care to keep the commandments of God. If a man sees now and then a spirit of love to God, he may safely conclude that his religion is not the fruit of ostentation, or slavish fear, but that a gracious spirit doth stir him up to per∣form his duty, and that his walk is holy.</P>

If he doth choice service for the church of God, yet he is an ungodly man. If there are twenty hopeful things that may be alledged for him, yet he will not pass for a godly man.

They don't justify themselves, neither do they excuse themselves, and say others do so as well as they, and if men be left of God who can help it; but they confess it, and bewail it before God, it is an affliction to them that they were carried away with temptation, they see they have acted foolishly, that they have despised the commandments of God, and they hope they shall never do so again, be drunk a∣gain, or lie again. Sometimes men take occa∣sion to talk with them, and they are ready to own their fault, they are ashamed, and they shed tears; but after a while the temptation returns, and they are as bad again: They are like the dead fish, that are carried down the stream; but they are sorry again; and so they keep on, sinning and repenting.

It is impossible to do those actions without a disposition to do them; and that disposition is a principle or habit of grace. Every man that acts graciously is a new crea∣ture: Until the heart be changed, it will not carry gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>usly. Any act or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace is a sure tok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion: If a man believes in Christ o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly born of God; Joh. 1.12 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>him gave he power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, even to them that believ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o were born not of

blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI> If a man breaths, and sees, and hears, and walks, he is certainly a living man. Where there is an act of life, there is a principle of life; 1 Joh. 37. <HI>He that doth righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.</HI> Every effect must have a proper cause. If the heart were utterly opposite to believing, loving or repenting, he would not believe, love or repent. The heart of a man is always inclined to what he chuses. The Mind may understand a thing that he is not inclined to understand; but the Will ne∣ver chuses without an inclination so to do. If there be a change in the behaviour of the heart, there is a change in the disposition of the heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. If a principle of grace were once there, it is always there. It was otherwise▪ under the covenant of works: <HI>Adam's</HI> grace was perfect but mutable; for he did not fulfill the condition of the covenant; if he had once done that, his grace would have been immutable. But under the new covenant, if a man be once godly, he always will be god∣ly; for every one who is godly, has fulfilled the condition of the covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may decay, but it will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may wither, but never die. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay be lost, but saving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> If grace be once begun it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.6. <HI>I am confident of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that

Once godly and always godly; 1 Pet. 1.5. <HI>Who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation.</HI> Sometimes they are afraid they shall fall away, but whether they have more strength or less strength, they shall never fall away; God's Covenant is their security. Such men may have great temptations; He∣reticks may endeavour to seduce them, viti∣ous men may seek to debauch them, world∣ly men may entice them, persecutors may seek to fright them out of their religion; but nothing can be two hard for them. <HI>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it,</HI> Cant. 8.7. They may have temptation to pride, to presumption, to dis∣couragement; but if they be led into tempta∣tion, they will be delivered from evil. A principle of grace is like a living fountain; Joh. 4.14. <HI>Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I had gave him, shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.</HI> False hearted men may fall away, but tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill be more than Con∣qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e once godly, he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he lives an hundred and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> face be begun here, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aven.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="002072_0140_0FBB7BC1400EE098"/>USE III. Of direction to godly men, how you may know your sincerity; <HI>viz.</HI> by renewing the visible actings of grace. Many signs are given of holiness, that will not bear examination; and there is danger that many are deceived thereby. Some godly, and some ungodly men that find them in them∣selves may be comforted thereby, but they beget no assurance: And some men that find them in themselves, remain at a loss whether they be godly or no. The way to know your godliness, is to renew the visible exer∣cises of grace. When a man sees that he loves God, and believes in Jesus Christ, he will not be unsatisfyed about his godliness. If he has been in the dark, and in great temptations just before, yet this will beget assurance.</P>
<P>Here you may observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. If you do not know that you live in sin, that can be no evidence of your godli∣ness: As you cannot condemn your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, so you cannot justify your selves, Some persons examine themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they live in any known sin; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est enquiry they do not find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> do not find that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f any duty, or in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Their hearts do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey

duly attend prayer, they are careful to sancti∣fy the Sabbath, they live soberly, chastly, just∣ly, they are true to their word, and faithful in their places, they don't know upon the most narrow search that they live in any way of sin, yet they cannot justify themselves from hence; 1 Cor. 4.4. <HI>I know nothing by my self yet am I not hereby justified:</HI> For men that ex∣amine themselves may be ignorant that they live in away of sin, yet they may live in a way of sin; men's understandings are corrupted, and they may live in pride, worldliness and unbelief, and not know it: They may think those corruptions don't reign when indeed they do reign. Many men that don't know that they live in sin, are fain to suspend their judgment about themselves; they hope from hence that they are holy, but dont know it. Though men dont know that they live in sin, yet God may know that they do: Prov. 30.12. <HI>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleansed from their filthiness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If there be great probability that you live in a way of faith, and love, and repen∣tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on't make it evident.

great burden to them, and they are careful to avoid sin: but probabilities prove nothing; that may be probable, that may be false▪ there may be some probability of a thing, yet the contrary may be certain. Probabilities leave men under uncertainties. If they raise hopes, yet they leave room for fears. There may be probabilities one way, and as great probabilities the other way. Men wont con∣tent themselves with a probable title to their land. God will not take men to heaven because there is a probability of their good∣ness. Twenty Probabilities make the thing more probable, but they don't make it certain. Probabilities are no Demonstrations. The hopes that are built on them may be disappointed, therefore we are directed to <HI>make our Calling and Election sure.</HI> 2 Pet. 1.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. All the visible exercises of grace are evi∣dential. The word of God tells that all that believe in Jesus Christ are Children of God. Joh. 1.12. <HI>To them that received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God.</HI> It tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat all that love God are heirs of s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ven.

these workings be clearly seen, the man has a sure evidence of his good estate: He has ground to cast the case for himself: It is no presumption for him to conclude his Justifi∣cation: He has a divine warrant to give sen∣tence for himself: At such a time when he pro∣nounces himself a saint, he goes according to law and evidence: His confidence is assurance: For those exercises of grace that he is consci∣ous to are peculiar to godly men, and do assu∣redly distinguish them from all other men.</P>
<P N="4">4.
