<Q><HI>Train up</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> catechise) <HI>a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it,</HI> Prov. xxii 6. <HI>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 13. <HI>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear,</HI>

<P>SEEING next to our own souls our chil∣dren are, or ought to be, the immediate ob∣jects of our constant care and diligent concern, we ought to omit no oppor∣tunity to instruct them betimes in the principles
<PB N="iv" REF="007005_0003_102AE1869FF98FE8"/>of Truth, in order to bring them in their early days to a sense of the unspeak∣able love, and infinite wis∣dom and power of their Almighty Creator.</P>
<P>For good and early im∣pressions on tender minds; often prove lasting means of preserving them in a religious life even to old age; and as they grow up, let us watch over them for good, and rule over them in the fear of
<PB N="v" REF="007005_0004_102AE188EC580148"/>God, maintaining our au∣thority in love; and keep them as much as possible under our notice and observation, lest be∣ing left to themselves, they be thereby exposed to the danger of evil ex∣amples and corrupt prin∣ciples, from which let us labour fervently in spirit, that the merciful Lord may preserve our off∣spring, and favourably grant them an inheri∣tance
<PB N="vi" REF="007005_0005_102AE18B3B03A2B0"/>in the blessed <HI>Truth, infinitely</HI> transcending the greatest inheritances in this world, which have oftentimes proved a snare to many bright young men of excellent endow∣ments.</P>
<P>And whereas the holy scriptures contain a full account of things most surely to be <HI>believed,</HI> and divine commands to be faithfully <HI>obey'd,</HI> and are said <HI>to make us wise unto</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="007005_0006_102AE18D962DB430"/><HI>salvation thro' faith which is in Christ Jesus,</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 15. 'Tis the duty of every Christian to be fre∣quent and diligent in the public reading of them in their families, and pri∣vate meditating in those sacred records.</P>
<P>Likewise that the a∣ged not only propose to the young those pious examples therein record∣ed for their imitation: but acquaint them that
<PB N="viii" REF="007005_0007_102AE18F237F0940"/>the same good experience of the work of <HI>sanctifica∣tion</HI> is now to be witnes∣sed, as was in the first a∣ges of christianity, and therefore earnestly press them betimes to seek af∣ter the same, seeing no unclean thing can enter into heaven; by the way cautioning them to re∣ceive or believe no doc∣trine, how specious soe∣ver, contrary or contra∣dictory to those holy wri∣tings
<PB N="ix" REF="007005_0008_102AE192B23A8928"/>of the inspired pro∣phets, and apostles of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which thro' Di∣vine Providence have been so wonderfully preserved thro' so many ages for our edification and comfort.</P>
<P>Now tho' we of this generation in these pro∣testant countries, are so signally favour'd with the free and undisturb'd use of this large and most excellent volume, which
<PB N="x" REF="007005_0009_102AE194B86C8CB0"/>contains a vast variety of remarkable providences and prophecies, from the beginning of the world, to the end of time.</P>
<P>Yet seeing such inces∣sant labour and pains are taken, both early and late, to propagate the pernicious doctrines of infidelity, deism, pro∣phaneness and atheism; we esteem it both impru∣dent and dangerous to de∣lay the first seasoning of
<PB N="xi" REF="007005_0010_102AE1964DDD9368"/>the minds of our dear and tender offspring, with the fundamentals of the christian doctrine, till they are of a capacity and ability to collect and ex∣tract from thence the same for themselves; nor is it in the power or lei∣sure of every well-mean∣ing parent, for the help of whom is this brief summary put into the hands of both parents and children, in the use
<PB N="xii" REF="007005_0011_102AE198AE66E030"/>which, and perusal of the holy scriptures, as pa∣rents find the openings of Truth, they may fur∣ther explain and declare to the rising generation, the praises of the Lord, their own christian expe∣riences, and his wonder∣ful works to the children of men, that so from ge∣neration to generation, his ever worthy name may be extolled, mag∣nified and adored thro∣out
<PB N="xiii" REF="007005_0012_102AE19B8F2F1D90"/>all ages, world with∣out end. Amen.</P>
<P>P. S. <HI>As this is in∣tended principally for the use of children, 'twas not thought convenient to a∣muse their tender minds, at first, with too many sublime and controverted points, which, if any hereafter have a desire to understand, they are referred to the</HI> Catechism <HI>and</HI> Apology <HI>of our worthy
<PB N="xiv" REF="007005_0013_102AE19DEC078F88"/>friend</HI> Robert Barclay, <HI>which have been of no small service in collect∣ing the following queries.</HI></P>

<P>Some PRINCIPLES and PRECEPTS of the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>WHO made thee?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God made me, the world, and all things therein, and is Lord of heaven and earth
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>a</HI>) Gen. i. 1. Job x. 8. Isa. xiv. 12. Psa. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 3 Acts xvii. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="007005_0015_102AE1A3AFD842B0"/>
Q. <HI>Is it not the chief∣est good to know God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Je∣sus Christ whom thou hast sent
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>b</HI>) John xvii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How may one attain to the knowledge of God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the revelation of the Son; for no man knoweth who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the
<PB N="3" REF="007005_0016_102AE1A53B06E6A0"/>Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>c</HI>) Luke x. 22. Matt. xi. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Where is the reve∣lation of the Father and of the Son?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In Man. What is to be known of God is manifest in men, for God has shew'd it unto them
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>d</HI>) Rom.i. 19.</NOTE>. God has reveal'd them unto us by his Spi∣rit, for the Spirit search∣eth all things, yea the deep things of God
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>e</HI>) 1 Cor. ii. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007005_0017_102AE1A800C5E428"/>
Q. <HI>What is it that makes manifest?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Light: whatsoever makes manifest is light
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>f</HI>) Eph. r. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Doth this light shine in man?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: And the light shineth in darkness, but the darkness compre∣hended it not
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>g</HI>) John i. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Is this light univer∣sal, or doth it enlighten every man?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea: This is the
<PB N="5" REF="007005_0018_102AE1AAE179B7A8"/>true light, which light∣eth every man that com∣eth into the world
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>h</HI>) John i. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Is this light divine or human?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Divine: For in him [Christ the divine word] was life, and the life was the light of men
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>i</HI>) John i. 4.</NOTE>. Then surely the life of Christ, who is the light of men, must needs be divine.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007005_0019_102AE1AD11ADA280"/>
Q. <HI>Can't man be a light to himself?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, can darkness be a light to itself? Man can be no more a light to his mind than he is to his body: as Cod has provided the sun a glori∣ous light for the body; so himself is a far more exceeding light to the minds of all men, to whom the nearer they approach the more they partake of the enliven∣ing
<PB N="7" REF="007005_0020_102AE1B061236218"/>beams of the sun of righteousness.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How do'st thou prove this?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> For ye were some∣times darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord. God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>k</HI>) Eph. v. 8. 1 John i. 5. 2 Cor. iv. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Then should not we
<PB N="8" REF="007005_0021_102AE1B316343828"/>trust in God, and not lean to our own under∣standing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The wise man com∣mands to trust in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine own understanding. For he that trusts in his own heart, is a fool. We are are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>l</HI>) Prov. ili. 5. xxviii, 26. 2 Cor. iii. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007005_0022_102AE1B64E752C00"/>
Q. <HI>Is then whole God, or whole Christ in every man?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No: Tho' the il∣lumination or light comes from God and Christ: yet whole God and whole Christ is no more in eve∣ry man, than the whole sun or whole air is in e∣very chamber: so small a vessel of mortality can't confine him whom the heaven of heavens can't contain, that immense
<PB N="10" REF="007005_0023_102AE1B7DAA716F0"/>ocean of immortality and light inaccessible, which is every where present
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>m</HI>) 1 Tim. vi. 16. Ps. lxviii. 33. 2 Chron. ii. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>For what end doth this divine light shine in the dark hearts of the children of men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God, who com∣manded light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give us the light of the know∣ledge of the glory of
<PB N="11" REF="007005_0024_102AE1BA19A2CA38"/>God in the face of his Son Jesus Christ
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>n</HI>) 2 Cor. iv. 5.</NOTE>. It gives a true discerning betwixt good and evil, comfort∣ing in well-doing, and reproving for evil.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How is that proved?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light. But he that doth
<PB N="12" REF="007005_0025_102AE1BC92EF3AA0"/>truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>n</HI>) John iii. 20, 11. Eph. v. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>Q. <HI>Doth Christ our Lord command us to believe in, and take heed to the light?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be children of the light. The lamb is the light thereof, and the nations of them which are saved
<PB N="13" REF="007005_0026_102AE1BE8E045548"/>shall walk in the light of it
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>p</HI>) John xil. 36. Rev. xxi. 23, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Were the apostles of our Lord directed to turn people to the light.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes: Delivering thee (<HI>says our Lord to</HI> Paul) from the people, and from the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of <HI>Satan</HI> unto God, that they may
<PB N="14" REF="007005_0027_102AE1C08E375010"/>receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctifi∣ed by faith that is in me. This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no dark∣ness at all
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>q</HI>) Acts xxvi. 17, 18. 1 John i. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What benefits have they who walk in the light?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very great and excellent ones; as, If we
<PB N="15" REF="007005_0028_102AE1C21E6BB458"/>walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with an∣other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son clean∣seth us from all fin; and our Lord says, I am the light of the world, he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>r</HI>) 1 John i. 7. John viii. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Did not the holy an∣cients call this divine
<PB N="16" REF="007005_0029_102AE1C48B7810D0"/>principle of light by many other names?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, 'tis called the Grace of God which bring∣eth salvation. 'Tis cal∣led Truth, as, The law was given by <HI>Moses;</HI> but Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ: Also the Comforter and Spirit of Truth, as said our Lord; I will pray the Father, and he shall give you an∣other Comforter, that he may abide with you for∣ever,
<PB N="17" REF="007005_0030_102AE1C6165842B8"/>even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwell∣eth with you, and shall be in you
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>s</HI>) Titus ii. 11. John i. 17. xiv. 16, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Why hath it these different names?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To set forth its va∣rious manifestations and operations in the soul of man.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>As how?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007005_0031_102AE1C7B2B12470"/>
<HI>A.</HI> Because it enlivens, therefore it is called the Spirit; because it en∣lightens, therefore it is called light, and because it renders the Spirit tru∣ly gracious and accepta∣ble in the sight of its Sa∣viour, 'tis call'd the Grace of God and Spirit of Truth.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But why are shey the same?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Inasmuch as the same divine properties
<PB N="19" REF="007005_0032_102AE1CA0E9C43D0"/>are ascribed to one and all of them, 'tis plain it is the same and not ano∣ther principle, proceed∣ing from the father and the son, and leading all its followers to God a∣gain.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Can'st thou prove this briefly from the holy scriptures?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, <HI>David</HI> long ago prayed, O! send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me, let
<PB N="20" REF="007005_0033_102AE1CC79AB0020"/>them bring me unto thy holy hill, and thy ta∣bernacle. And the spirit of God strove with the old world
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>t</HI>) Psalm xlii 3. Gen. vi. 3. Neh. ix 20.</NOTE>. And in the new, a manifestation of the spirit is given to every one to profit with∣al. When the spirit of truth <HI>(says our Lord)</HI> is come, he will guide you into all truth. He will reprove the world of sin
<PB N="21" REF="007005_0034_102AE1CE07762030"/><HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>v</HI>) 1 Cor. xii. 7 John xvi. 13. John xvi. 8.</NOTE>. And the apostle to <HI>Titus,</HI> says, The grace of God that bringeth sal∣vation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, right∣eously and godly in this present world
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>x</HI>) Thus il. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>If the saving grace of God appears to all, why are not all saved?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 'Tis not because
<PB N="22" REF="007005_0035_102AE1D0070034B0"/>the grace is not suffi∣cient; but because all do not obey the bles∣sed discoveries of this saving grace, light and truth; but some turn from them into wanton∣ness, like truants, from this school of grace, they become neither disciples, nor learned in this hea∣venly university. Such who rebel against, and quench the good spirit of God are the cause of
<PB N="23" REF="007005_0036_102AE1D205A00870"/>their own destruction
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>y</HI>) 2 Cor. xii. 9. Jude iv. Neh. ix. 20, 26</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Then this blessed principle is a divine guide and perfect teacher, see∣ing it leads into all truth, moral and divine, in faith and practice, what hath it taught the holy artients?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Many wonderful and divine truths, re∣corded in that best of all books, the holy scrip∣tures
<PB N="24" REF="007005_0037_102AE1D473BB6880"/>of the old and new testament, which holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>z</HI>) 2 Peter i. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>For what end were the scriptures writ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> From a child thou hast known the holy seriptures, which are a∣ble to make thee wise un∣to salvation, thro' faith which is in Christ Jesus: all scripture given by
<PB N="25" REF="007005_0038_102AE1D6048D11D0"/>inspiration of God, is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correcti∣on, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be per∣fect, thoroughly furnish∣ed unto all good works
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>a</HI>) 2 Tim. iii. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What do these ex∣cellent writings teach us concerning God the Father Almighty?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That there is but one God, who is an eter∣nal
<PB N="26" REF="007005_0039_102AE1D81D69DC88"/>Spirit, and must be worship'd in Spirit and in truth, that he is Almigh∣ty, the Creator and Su∣preme Governor of heaven and earth, and all things therein, and upholds them all by the word of his power, is every where present, and knows the secrets of all men, of infinite justice, wisdom, holiness and goodness

<P><PB N="27" REF="007005_0040_102AE1DA9122CB88"/>
Q. <HI>What in particular do the holy evangelists teach concerning Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That he the eter∣nal word, took our na∣ture upon him, and was like us in all things, sin excepted, that he was conceived by the holy Ghost in the womb of the virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> born in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> of <HI>Judea</HI> above 1700 years ago, preached many heaven∣ly
<PB N="28" REF="007005_0041_102AE1DDB4DF2BE8"/>doctrines, which he confirmed by many won∣derful miracles, and suf∣fered a shameful death under <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> governor, being crucified, dead and bu∣ried in the sepulchre of <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea,</HI> rose again on the third day, and ascended into heaven, where he sits at the right hand of God.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Will not God judge</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="007005_0042_102AE1DF428E01C8"/><HI>the world by Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, God hath ap∣pointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by him, even that bles∣sed man Christ Jesus, ac∣cording to their works; when all nations shall be gathered before him, and he shall separate the sheep from the goats, to the sheep, he will pro∣nounce the joyful sen∣tence, Come ye blessed

<P>Q. <HI>What do the scrip∣tures teach concerning the Holy Ghost?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That it is the spi∣rit
<PB N="31" REF="007005_0044_102AE1E34F2A5300"/>of the Father, and of the Son, the Comforter and Sanctifier of all God's people, and that which reproves the world of sin, and that these Three, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, bles∣sed for ever
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>d</HI>) 1 John v. 7. John xiv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>To what end do the scriptures ascribe the death and sufferings of our blessed Lord?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He was wounded
<PB N="32" REF="007005_0045_102AE1E6712DB4D8"/>for our transgressions, he was bruised for our ini∣quities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. Christ also hath once suffered for our sins, the just for the unjust. By the grace of God he hath tasted death for every man. Who is a propitiation not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world. Whom God hath
<PB N="33" REF="007005_0046_102AE1E86F442C88"/>sent forth to be a propi∣tiation thro' faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the re∣mission of sins that are past, thro' the forbear∣ance of God. When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his son

<P>Q. <HI>How may we reap the benefit of Christ's death and sufferings?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="007005_0047_102AE1E9FA5F92B0"/>
<HI>A.</HI> By faith and obe∣dience, for we are saved by grace thro' faith, and that not of ourselves, 'tis the gift of God. He became the author of e∣ternal salvation unto all them that obey him
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(<HI>f</HI>) Eph. ii. 8. Heb. v. 9</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Which is the true faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That which works by love and purifies the heart, gives victory o∣ver sin, which separates

<P>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God <HI>am</HI> a jealous God, visiting the
