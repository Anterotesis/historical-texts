<P>We tho't when we sent the Letter and Belt from the <HI>Canada</HI> In∣dians, that we should receive an Answer to it for Our further Proceeding, but instead of that we received the Governour's Direction to meet him here for the Ratification of the Treaty. As to the first Motions of Peace when we heard of it from the Governour, we were very glad of it, and were ready to join in the Peace, and made Proposals in order to effect it, and particularly about the Lands, and the <HI>English</HI> quitting the two Houses, viz. <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>St. George</HI>'s, which the Government did not see cause to come into; If they had, we with the other Indians should all have come into a Peace before now, and there would be no Difficulty with the others; not that the Houses should be removed at a great Distance, but that the House at <HI>St. George</HI>'s should be removed to <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> and that at <HI>Richmond</HI> to <HI>Arrowsick,</HI> for the Trading∣Houses. As for the <HI>Penchscutt-Tribe</HI> they are so careful that they will do every Thing that is just, That there shall be no Breach or Misunderstanding for the future, but that the Tribes round about us might approve of every thing
<PB N="6" REF="007216_0006_102B3E8B49B42D38"/>we do, it was further mentioned in the Treaty, that if any of the Tribes should rise or break up what was therein Agreed on, or lift up the Hatchet, we shall all join in suppressing them, and so we now Agree. We have nothing further to offer now.</P>

<P>Besides what I mentioned at first, that the several Governments are come down to receive the Ratification of the Peace from you, There are Gentlemen here present from the Government of the Province of the <HI>Massachu∣setts-Bay,</HI> to prove the <HI>English</HI> Rights to the Land Eastward, pursuant to the aforesaid Treaty, so that you may perceive we are come fully provided to make good the Treaty on Our Part, according to the Articles agreed on.

<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>Before we proceed, it is necessary that you give us a true and full Account why the <HI>Narridgwock Indians</HI> are not here, as you have engaged for them in the Treaty made at <HI>Boston,</HI> which now lies on the Table: We have considered of what you said to us, at our meeting on Saturday last, and as to the Proposals of the <HI>Norridgwock</HI> and other Tribes, that the Treaty be held at <HI>Mount-Royal,</HI> we say, that it's contrary to the Articles of Peace made at <HI>Boston,</HI> and therefore deserves no Answer, and you know that we al∣ways told you, that it was beneath the Honour of the <HI>English Government</HI> to Treat with the <HI>Indians</HI> in a <HI>French Country;</HI> and as to the Insinuations of the <HI>Canada Indians,</HI> that our Commissioners begun a Treaty there, it is not true, for our Commissioners were sent there to Demand of the <HI>French Governour</HI> in the Name of <HI>King GEORGE</HI> not to assist the <HI>Indians</HI> in the War against us, and also to Restore all the <HI>English Captives</HI> in that Government, which they declared to the Governour of <HI>Canada</HI> as soon as they Ar∣rived, and that they had no other Business in that Country.</P>
<P>As to the Two Houses you except against, you may Remember you were told at <HI>Boston,</HI> that <HI>King GEORGE</HI> had a Right to build Houses where he pleased within his Dominions, and we have not built any Houses on Lands in the <HI>Eastern Parts</HI> but what we have
<PB N="7" REF="007216_0007_102B3E8F3A38A5D8"/>Purchased, and are ready to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Title, and that the Houses mentioned were not kept for Offence after the <HI>Ratification,</HI> but as they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly Scituated in the Judgment of the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> for supplying the <HI>Indians,</HI> which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concluded you had rested satisfied with, and you may depend that we shall not de∣part from that or any other of our Engagements: This is all we have is say to you at present, if you desire it, it shall all he repeated to you over again.</P>

<P>We will now give our Answer to what was said Yesterday. And first give the Reason why the <HI>Narridgwock</HI> Tribe is not here; we shall be very plain, and tell the Truth and nothing but the Truth why they are not here. We sent a Messenger over to the <HI>Narridgwocks, St. Francois,</HI> and <HI>Wowenocks,</HI> for them to come over here to the Treaty, to hear what was said: when the Messen∣gers were got to those Tribes they discoursed 'em, and deliver'd their Message to come over here, but the <HI>St. Francois, Wowenocks,</HI> and the <HI>Narridgwocks,</HI> made Answer, that they would have the <HI>Penobscutt</HI> Chiefs with these Governments come over there to hear the Treaty, There were Six of the <HI>Narridgwock</HI> Indians came over to <HI>Penobscutt</HI> this Spring, they missed of the Messengers that were sent from <HI>Penobscutt</HI> to <HI>Narridgwock;</HI> then Two went back and Four staid till the <HI>Penobscutt</HI> Messengers return'd with an Answer from the <HI>St. Francois,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="8" REF="007216_0008_102B3E91104B8A10"/>with the Two Belts; the Four <HI>Narridgwock</HI> Indians that tarried behind would come here and have been present at the Ratification, but the Belts being sent occasioned their not coming. When the Belts came to <HI>Penobscutt,</HI> we had Ad∣vice then from the Governour of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> of his coming down to the Ratification, and the Four <HI>Narridgwock</HI> Indians told the <HI>Penobscutts,</HI> to go on, and what ever they did was all one as if they were Present, &amp; the <HI>Narriagwocks</HI> after that went to <HI>Canada.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Lt. Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the last Account you have had of the <HI>Narridgwocks</HI> Indians?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's but a little while since they went away, and we have not heard from them since. The last Man that went away, when he went off he said he would go foremost to the <HI>Arresaguntecock</HI> Indians, and discourse 'em on the Mes∣sage they have sent, expecting that the Government and the <HI>Penobscutt</HI> Chiefs will give an Answer also to the Belts, as we are Brothers. This is what we Answer as to the First Part of what was said to us Yesterday. Now we pro∣ceed to make Answer to the Second Part of Yesterday's Discourse. Every thing of the Treaty is very plain to us, and there is nothing in the Way excepting the Two Houses; in case they could be removed a little further in, as we mentioned Yesterday. The Governour was mentioning that he would Settle no Lands, but what good Rights and Titles be set forth to, and in case the Lands were Sold, we have a Number of young People growing up who never were acquainted of the Lands being Sold: The Government is a Great and Rich Government, and if the Lands were Sold, they were Sold for a small Matter, and Cost but little, and it would be but a small Matter for the Government to make Allowance for them, and give them up.</P>

<P>WE have Considered your Motion, That we would re∣move those two Houses on <HI>Kennebeck</HI> and <HI>St. George's∣Rivers</HI> a little further in: To which we Answer, That those Houses are on Lands Purchased by His Majesty's Subjects, which we are ready by Commissioners appointed by the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> for that Affair, to make evident to you, (altho' the <HI>Narridgwocks</HI> are not Present) by producing fair Deeds under the Hands of the <HI>Sachems</HI> of those Countrys for the same, as well as di∣vers Treaties where you Allow'd and Confirm'd to the <HI>English</HI> all the Lands formerly possessed by them, which Commissioners are here present for that Ser∣vice, those Lands being for a long Time since purchased by His Majesty's
<PB N="9" REF="007216_0009_102B3E931922C8B0"/>Subjects, and the Property vested in them, the Government cannot Disclaim them; And now as you have assured us, that you very well know all the Articles of the Peace which was made at <HI>Boston,</HI> and that you are ready to come hither to Ratify them, so we are also ready to receive the said Ratification, and now expect that it shall be done accordingly. We have no more to say, but to demand of you what <HI>English</HI> Captives you have ready to Exchange, Pursuant to an Article of the Treaty on that behalf.

<P>We have been tho'tful of, and consulted what was said to Day, and now will give Answer to it. We understood he Governour was tho'tful why the <HI>Narridgwock</HI> Indians were not here, We are also tho'tful, It is a Hindrance, so far as we should be glad they should be sent for again, We are of Opinion if they should be sent for they would appear here forthwith, the Reason why we mention this is because we would be very careful in what we do in our Pro∣ceedings, that none should break in upon our Proceedings: We should be very sorry if any Thing should happen amiss as to what we have done, We are not knowing that any are design'd or intend to break our Treaty, but we are very tho'tful and Concern'd that none shall do it. We insist upon the removal of those two Houses which was mentioned last Winter, we again make mention of them now, and if they were removed, there would be no Difficulty among the Tribes. We can't find any Record in our Memory, nor in the Memory of Our Grand-Fathers, that the <HI>Penobscutt</HI> Tribe have Sold any Land, As to the Deeds mentioned last Winter, made by <HI>Medoccewanda</HI> and <HI>Sheepsout John,</HI> they were not <HI>Penobscutt</HI> Indians, one belonging to <HI>Machias Medockewondo,</HI> the other towards <HI>Boston,</HI> If we should find in reality that the Lands were Purchased of the right Owners, we should not have insisted upon it, nor have opened our Mouths, we would not pretend to tell a Lye about it, for we know that God will be angry with the Man that tells a Lye, We do not remember of any Settlements at <HI>St. George's,</HI> we remember a pretty while, and as long as we remember, the Place where the Garrison stands was fill'd with Great long grown Trees. As to the mentioning of Prisoners as we told you last Winter, we had not one in our whole Tribe, so we say now, We have not one Prisoner in our Tribe, if we had, we would have brought 'em in long before now, all the Prisoners we took, as we took them, they were return'd to <HI>Boston,</HI> or sent to <HI>Canada</HI> to the French, and whose that are among the French, we have no Command of; We mention it over again, that if we had any Prisoners, we should have brought 'em in long ago, for we understand it that the Peace was concluded at the Signing the Articles almost a Twelve-Month ago: All the Controversy now is about a small Tract of Land, which is but a Trifle, and all is finished except∣ing that, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trifle.

<P>The Lieut.

<P>The above Ratification was signed in the Presence of a considerable Number of Spectators, Gentlemen, and Others, who subscribed as Witnesses, and then deliver'd to the Indians.</P>
<P>A Copy of the said Ratification was endorsed on the Instrument Lt. Governour <HI>Wentworth</HI> gave the Indian Delegates at the signing the Treaty at <HI>Boston,</HI> and publickly executed by him in the Presence of the before mentioned Witnesses, who also subscribed.</P>

<P>The Instrument that Major <HI>Mascarene</HI> gave you at the signing the Treaty in Behalf of the Government of <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tia</HI> or L'<HI>Acadie,</HI> will be Rati∣fied and Confirmed to any Persons you shall send on your Behalf to the Gover∣nour at <HI>Annapolis-Royal.</HI></P>
<P>In Behalf of the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> I shall make you some small Presents. I am very much disappointed when I come to see the Things which I design'd to make a Present of to you, for they are not so good as I ex∣pected, but soon after (it shall please GOD) I arrive at <HI>Boston,</HI> I shall see the Great Court, to whom I shall heartily recommend you as good Friends, Con∣federates and Neighbours; acquainting them of your ready and chearful Compliance with your Engagements in Ratifying and Confirming the Articles of Peace made at <HI>Boston,</HI> which doubtless will have a proper Consideration, and therefore I shall be very glad then to see you the Chief Sachem WENNE∣MOUETT, with two or three of your principal Men attending you at <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>Then his Honour ordered the Presents to be delivered. And proceeded,</P>

There were two of your Young Men sent to <HI>Canada</HI> last Year, in the Service of this Province; I would see them, that I might make them a Consideration for their Trouble and loss of Time in performing the Message. Upon which only one of them, viz. <HI>Loron</HI>'s Son appeared, the other the Sachem said, was lest at <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/>,</HI> the Lieut.

<P>We make bold to mention to the Governour one Thing, that when we were at <HI>St. George's,</HI> we desired a Vessel to bring us here, so as we are now short of Canoes, we desire the Governour would supply us with a Vessel to carry us back again.</P>

<P>WE should have seen you sooner, but a great deal of our Time has been taken up in preparing a fair Draught of the Conference so far, and comparing it with the Minutes, our own particular Business has not hindred us from seeing you before.</P>
<P>Good Friends, <HI>Whereas the Articles of Peace now stand Ratified and Confirmed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Part, for and in Behalf of your Selves and Others the Tribes of the</HI> Eastern In∣dians, <HI>particularly made mention of in the aforesaid Articles, so that you and we ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about our Necessary and lawful Business, without the least Hazard or Danger from one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Our Persons or Estates, and a Friendly Communication kept up and per∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuated
<PB N="16" REF="007216_0016_102B3EA5B396C598"/>among us: But inasmuch as the</HI> Narridgweeks <HI>and other Tribes, did not P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sonally appear at the late Solemn and Publick Ratification, We justly fear that the In∣habitants on the Frontiers will be in a great Measure retarded, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut by from improv∣ing their Lands and Estates there on that Account, until the aforesaid Tribes do personally manifest their Approving and Consenting to what you have so Wisely and Maturely done for them.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot therefore part with you without letting you know, that it will greatly send to your Good as well as our Peace and Quiet, to remove all Suspicion of Mischief on this score, that the beneficial Ends proposed by us all may be fully effected, and by the Blessing of GOD out of the Power of any ill-minded Person to break in upon the same: We do therefore strenuously urge, that you let us know what Steps you intend to take with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Tribes, and that you resolutely pursue and bring to pass what we now move to you, and justly expect your punctual and ready Compliance therewith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to what the Governour was mentioning in the first Part of what he has now said, that the Inhabitants on the Frontiers will be afraid of making Improvements, it is also so with us; we are Cencern'd since we have not seen them; We could make Answer to the Governour's Speech now, but we will consider of it till the Afternoon, and shall th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n be more particular in our Answer.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will now mention to the Governour what the Thoughts of the Chiefs are. The Governour was mentioning unto us to Day that he would have us to say what we proposed to help those Persons that would be uneafy it, the Frontier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, upon account of the <HI>Norridgwocks,</HI> &amp;c. not being present at the Ratification; It's the Nature and Custom of the Indians, whenever they send a Letter or Belt to any Nation, to expect an Answer to their Letter: when any of us write a Letter, we expect a full Answer to the Contents of it, altho' the Subject-matter thereof is not liked: we desire the Governour to mention what Answer he designs to send in Answer to the Belt, or that he would say if he de∣sires it that we would express our Answer to it: We mention this because we understand it that the Belt was sent to us both, and therefore propose that the Governour would make an Answer first to it if he pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A proper Answer from you to what I said to you in the Morning, will contain an Answer to the Belt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Matter would be more weighty if the Governour would be∣gin in the Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready to hear what you propose in order to join with you in the Answer to the Belt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will now make our Answer to the Tribes at <HI>Arreseguntecook,</HI> and our Answer unto them is as follows, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>We say Brothers, we are not able to make you an Answer to your <HI>Belt,</HI> wherein you sent for us, because the time is past for our <HI>Ratification</HI> of the Articles of the Treaty.
<PB N="17" REF="007216_0017_102B3EA7B49B1A20"/>We say Brothers, We wonder you should desire us to come over into that Country to Treat, which is a Place where we have no being. This Country is the Place where we belong to, and where the Treaty was begun, and where we think it ought to have been carried on. <HI>This is what we have to say in Answer to the Belt.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We will take it into Consideration, and desire you would give us an Answer to what we said in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have nothing further to propose, we shall have a Great Meeting in a little time, and shall agree what to say further to the <HI>Arreseguntecooks.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So far as you have spoken I take to be a proper Answer for you to make as to the Belt. I desire now you will say what Measures you propose to take, whereby the Inhabitants on our Frontiers may be made Easy and Safe notwithstanding the <HI>Narridgwocks</HI> &amp;c. did not personally appear to Ratify the Articles of the Treaty, agreeable to what I said in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Inhabitants on the Frontiers, we would have them be very careful, and as soon as we return Home, it shall be our first Care to send to all the Tribes, that there is a Peace made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you lay your Commands and Injunctions on the other Tribes for that Purpose, as far as you are able?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will do our utmost to oblige 'em to live peaceably towards us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you say you will resent it, if any hostile Acts or Injuries should be committed against our People?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will resent such Actions, and join our Young Men with your's in such Case, and oblige 'em to be quiet and set down; We mean in Case any of the Tribes should rise against us, or resist us, we will take effectual Means to set 'em down by Force. As to the first Treaty, we reckoned our Selves obliged to this, but we account we are under much more and stronger Obligations to do it now, since the Engagements our whole Tribe have taken upon 'em in Ratifying the Articles of the Treaty, and shall take effectual Care that any such Persons be obliged to set down. Major <HI>Mascarene</HI> told us the Government of <HI>Annapolis</HI> would Ratify the Treaty if we would send any Persons there on our Behalf for that Purpose; we don't suppose he is now going to <HI>Annapolis,</HI> but when he arrives there, we would pray him to take Care that that Government would send a Vessel for us to go there to Ratify the Articles of the Treaty, because the Bay is too bigg for us to pass over in our Canoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Mascarene.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall write to the Governour, who is now at <HI>Canso,</HI> of your Desire, upon my arrival at <HI>Boston,</HI> and doubt not of His Compliance there∣with, a few of you will be sufficient to carry the Instrument I gave you at <HI>Boston,</HI> to be Ratifyed by the Lieut. Governour or Commander in Chief, and I don't doubt but that those that come will be made very Welcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have something more to Offer. We observe that Capt. <HI>Gyle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is Weakly and Sickly, and if he should be removed by Death, we desire that some Body might be sent down to <HI>St. George's,</HI> to take care of the Trade; we think Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> a proper Person, not but that we think Capt. <HI>Gyles</HI> behaves
<PB N="18" REF="007216_0018_102B3EAA01812D78"/>very well in the Place: This we mention Sides-Ways as it were. We have not heard any Answer to our Letter about some Frenchmen killing some of our People a great Way up in the Country: We mention this because the Governour told us if any Mischiefs or Injuries should happen, we should ac∣quaint one another of it in order for Redress: We heard the Frenchmen were in Prison at <HI>Annapolis.</HI></P>
<P>The Lieut. Governour acquainted them, that he had received their Letter, and sent an Answer to it, and then recited the Contents of the Letter, and also his Answer to it, both of which were afterwards produced and shewn to the Indians; and then acquainted the Indians, that he had endeavoured by Examination, and other Means, to make out some Proof against the French∣man mentioned in the Letter, and now under Confinement; but could find none, yet he kept the said Frenchman a Prisoner at the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where he re∣mained at our coming away from <HI>Baston.</HI> And upon the Indians Desire, that Justice might be done on him; it was answer'd by the Lieut. Governour, That His Majesty King GEORGE, by his Laws, did not allow his Governours to meddle with Matters out of their own Provinces, but that all such Facts must be tried in the Governments wherein they were committed; and this being said to be done, not in our Government, but in that of <HI>Annapolis,</HI> the Lieut. Governour said he would send the Frenchman back thither, where they might prosecute him, and that they would have a good Opportunity of doing it when they should go thither to receive the Ratification of that Government: To which the Indians replied, they were fully satisfied, and content that it should be so.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are the Indian Prisoners at <HI>Boston</HI> in Health?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they are all very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire to know whether it is expected that the <HI>Penopscutts</HI> pro∣cure any <HI>English</HI> Prisoners before the <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners are delivered; we have before several Times acquainted the Governour we have not one with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We expect you do your utmost Endeavour to have the English Pri∣soners restored.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it expected we should buy the English Prisoners of the French?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How do you understand that Article in the Treaty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Articles we understand them fully, we have acquainted the Governour, we have not one Prisoner in our whole Tribe; We know of none; when we go Home we shall send directly to <HI>Canada,</HI> and acquaint them that we have made a Peace: The French <HI>Indians</HI> will then ask us presently, How many Captives have you brought away with you? We shall Answer, none. They will say, How does it look like a Peace, when you have not got the Captives?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As to what you say, that you shall tell the French <HI>Indians</HI> you have not got any of the Captives, I have not told you that I would not deliver up
<PB N="19" REF="007216_0019_102B3EAC50DD1F98"/>the Captives, I design you shall have them all, I mean all such as are in the Hands of the Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We speak truly, we have no <HI>English</HI> Captives in our Hands, but we speak for the <HI>Indians</HI> for those that are any where afar off, their Eyes are look∣ing upon us, and we would willingly satisfy them as far as we can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. <HI>Gov.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I design the Indian Captives shall be set at Liberty when I go to <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>Saccar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xes</HI> the Hostage shall also be set at Liberty.</P>
<P>There were several Persons attending, whose Friends and Relations are in the Hands of the French, who were recommended to the Indians for their Assistance in getting them returned home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Governour has offer'd that the Indian Captives shall all be re∣stored, and none kept back, so we say, that we will make Search for any Cap∣tives that may be among the Tribes, and shall take Care that they shall be re∣stored, and shall also do our utmost to get those redeemed that are in the Hands of the French. We shall not forget it: We have given our Words, and repeated our Promises and Engagements; and our Words are written down, and they will appear afterwards against us.</P>

<SALUTE>Honourable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE I continue in this important Post, shall at all Times think it my Duty and Honour to consult His Majesty's Service, the Interest of the Province; and not to Enterprise any Thing unworthy of Tuch Thoughts, nor would I ship any Opportunity to inform your Honour of all Occurrences to the End the Indian Affairs may appear in a true Light, and your Instructions be the Rule of my Practice from Time to Time: With these Views have wrote on all Occasions, and particularly on the 12th of <HI>June</HI> last to your Honour, and the 23d of the same to the Secretary, with Reference to the Con∣ference now on Foot, to which please to permit me to add on this Occasion, that though I esteem my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fortunate with the Indians in several Respects, cannot by any Means' as you overcome their Obstinacy against going to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as will appear by the inclosed L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, in which they don't assign every Reason for their not going, nor shall I, as not being for the Service of the present Day, hope it may suffice only to say that these Indians are pre∣judiced against, and to a great Degree resolved not to meet at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and in order to gild these Resolutions with specious Pretences, have sent some of their Chief Men to the <HI>Penobsests,</HI> if possible to prevent their going to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and tell me this Day that they have gained the Point, and expect to meet the said <HI>Pensbsests</HI> in this River to Morrow accordingly. Upon the whole, it appears to me that if the said <HI>Pensbsests</HI> join the other Indians as above, they will complexly finally conclude not to meet you at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> but if Capt. <HI>Gyles</HI> (in the Sloop sent from hence as mentioned in my last to the Secretary) can steer the <HI>Penobsest</HI> Indians to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> it seems as though these may follow, but with much Reluctance. In my last to your Honour I acquainted you that I thought the Indians would readily meet you at <HI>Arowsick,</HI> though they mentioned this Place only in their Letter, which it may be observed they have now come to, and I have no fear of a thorough Conference as I then mentioned, unless through a Disagreement in the Preliminaries; and though the way is Plain as yet, am very thoughtful least it should happen to come to such a critical Point, as that your Honour should be under a Necessity either not to Treat, or (put off the Governour and) come to <HI>Arowsick,</HI> which is somewhat likely if you return a peremptory Refusal to their Repucst of meeting in this River, except you have the <HI>Penobsests</HI> first with you at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and if they are not arrived (as I would fain perswade myself they are) it may succeed well if you please Lovingly to detain these Messengers a Day or two, to gain Time so as to hear from Capt. <HI>Gyles</HI> 'ere you give an Answer, unless it please you to come to the Mouth of this River. The Indians wait, and I have Time only to plead your Honour's Pardon if I have exceeded, and that I may Subscribe, as in Heart I am,</P>

<P>I Remember Yesterday I mentioned to your Honour, it was a good Day with us, and we should endeavour to hearken to one another; and I now shall Answer to what your Honour said. I have considered of it, and shall now speak. I rose up in <HI>Canada,</HI> resolved and forced my selt to come here, and know what your Ho∣nour had to say: Yesterday I heard what your Honour had to say; I was de∣termined at <HI>Canada</HI> to come; and now I am come to hear what you have said, and what your Honour has said to us I like very well; it is all pleasing to me, every Thing that lay in the Way as a Stumbling-Block we find was all cleared away before we came from <HI>Canada.</HI> I now declare to your Honour, as the Hearts of my Brethren are with you (<HI>making a Motion towards the</HI> Penobscots) so is my Heart also with you; as my Brothers Hearts who are here now are all with you; so is my Heart, and the Hearts of all the Indian Tribes round about us.</P>

<P>Good Friends and Brothers: I have one Thing to say; Yesterday was an Expression, that all former Injuries should be covered and done away, now it is concluded and done indeed: Now we have heard our Brethren say, what we have been thoughtful about for a Twelve-Month.</P>

<P>I have considered of the Message you brought me the other Night by some of each of the Tribes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with the News from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> Indians had made a Descent on <HI>Piz∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and killed a great many of the English; and alth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I don't give much Order to that Story, yet I think it is a proper Occasion to propose to you an Additional Article to the late Treaty, in order to deter that Tribe or any other Indians from violating the same, so happily made by Us and the se∣veral Tribes of Indians who are Parties thereto (the due Observance of which being so much to the common Tranquility and Happiness of all concerned) that upon any Hostility done or offered to be done by any Indians, the Tribes who have entered into, and Ratified the Treaty, shall furnish and supply <HI>fifty</HI> Indians with a Captain of their own, and the English <HI>two Hundred and fifty,</HI> and so in Proportion a lesser or greater Number as the Occasion shall require, both the English and Indians to be paid and subsisted by the English Govern∣ment, and under the Conduct and Command of such a general Officer as the English Governour may judge proper, to pursue and reduce such refractory Indians by Sea or Land, to live peaceably and quietly with their Neighbours, which by the Blessing of GOD, may prove an effectual Method to render us formidable to our Enemies, and thereby happily secure and perpetuate the Peace to Us, and to Our Posterity; and if any other Tribes of Indians shall make War upon any of the Tribes now entred into this Peace, in such Case the English shall assist them at their Cost and Charge with the like Proportion of Men as may be necessary. This is all I have now to say, and if you will go out and consider of it, and give me an Answer to it, I shall be ready to hear you on that or any other Affair you may have to offer.</P>

<P>I have something to say respecting Trade. Your Honour told us that in carrying on the Trade we should have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing as cheap as it was bought at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and that we should have for our Beaver as much as it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that I should take Notice of it, and observe as the Matter was carried on, I observe this Spring that the Goods we buy are dearer, and the Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cheaper than formerly; I shall say nothing but what is true, this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; when we told the Tribes how the Trade was to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on and it proves otherwise, it makes us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; there are a great many that talk to us in another Language (the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>) and tell us this Trade is but for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; it is to draw us in for a small Time, and then it will fall, and we shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lt. Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>That does not make good what you have asserted, but proceeds only on Account of the Price of Beaver's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Market, and not from any Rise on the Cost of our Goods: Have you not always a Bill of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Goods you buy, as well as an Account of the Price al∣lowed for the Beaver. I desire you always would, and thereby you may know that what I say is true. I am surprized to hear what you say, the English Go∣vernment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to raise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Farthing on the true Cost of the Goods, and I will be bound to give you Ten for One if ever you can make out what you have now said: I was apprehensive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Year you might have some Difficulty in Un∣derstanding Trade, and therefore I told then expresty, that the Prizes of all Goods would be sometimes higher and sometimes lower at the Markets, and that no Body could help it. And then what was said to them at the Con∣ference the Fifth of <HI>August</HI> last
<NOTE PLACE="marg">* Pag. 12.</NOTE> respecting Trade, was read and interpreted, which is in the Words following, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>

<P>While the Articles were in R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling immediately after the Article respecting Trade. The Indians by their Speaker <HI>Loron,</HI> acquainted the Lieutenant Governour that they had been told the Prices of Goods would be raised when the Ratification was over: The Lieutenant Governour answered them, that they might be assured that the Goods al∣ways were, and still should be bought with ready Money, and that the Government would not make any New Advance on their Goods, and for a Proof of it they would always be sensible and find that the Government would supply them cheaper than any other People whatsoever; that they are acquainted with the Nature of Markets, that they are sometimes higher and sometimes lower.</P></Q>

<P>We would Instance also in Powder, which has come higher to us lately, than we had it ever before.</P>
