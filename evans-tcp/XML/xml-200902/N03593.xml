<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough Preaching be more profitable to the Christian World than Writing; yet both Hearing and Reading are Means of divine Appointment, for the Conversion of GOD's Elect, and building up the Church of CHRIST in Knowledge, Faith and Holiness.</P>
<P>The Principal does not exclude Coadjuvant Means of Grace. We hear Ministers Speaking in the Name of the eternal KING, (whose Ambassadors they are) with Life and Power; and their feeling Af∣fections and flaming Zeal, are apt to kindle a Fire in our Breast by the Spirits in-breathing, without which the most charming Voice, is but as a lovely Song, making Melody in the Ear, never Penetrating the Heart.</P>
<P>On the other Hand; written Sermons vanish not in the Air; but abide in our View; are of more frequent, extensive, lasting Use; and may, by deli∣berate Perusal, be more fully understood, which is a necessary, and the first Step to profiting: For, if in hearing the Word, we understand it not, the Devil is ready to catch away the precious Seed, lest we should <HI>believe</HI> and be <HI>saved; Mat.</HI> 13.19. <HI>Luke</HI> 8.12, compar'd. Certain it is, the Lord must teach us to
<PB N="ii" REF="004390_0003_100D4DAF04FEB790"/>profit, if ever Good come of our Hearing, or Read∣ing; from him alone is our Fruit found: And in∣deed its alike easy with the Almighty to do us good by his Word preached or written; singly or both to∣gether.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ethiophan</HI> Eunuch was reading the Things concerning Christ, out of the evangelical Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Capt. 53. ver. 7. when the Spirit of GOD sent <HI>Philip</HI> to preach unto him JESUS; so his Faith came by hearing the Word preached; according to that of the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14 — 17. This is GOD's ordinary and standing Method of converting SOULS: Such therefore as would excuse their Neglect of Assembling themselves together, to hear the joyful Sound, by their giving Attendance to Reading on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> at Home, are quite: out of the Way of GOD's Blessing: But when the LORD is sought <HI>seasonably,</HI> and <HI>Diligently</HI> in all Means, he will be found in some of them; yea, in all of them will GOD be found, by such as <HI>diligently seek him, Heb.</HI> 11.6 Reading the Holy Scriptures, and good Books, that are according to the Prophets, and Apostles, and the Doctrine preached by JESUS CHRIST himself, shall prepare us for Hearing; and the Word preached shall excite us to, and teach us how to profit by Reading: Prov 8.33, 34 <HI>Blessed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the Posts of my Doors.</HI> Rev. 1.3. <HI>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the Words of this Prophesy, and keep those things that are written therein.</HI> Not only are the sacred Scriptures an incomparable Treasure; but the Writ∣ings of the meanest of Christ's Ministers are a pre∣cious Talent. To be much in Reading is a very
<PB N="iii" REF="004390_0004_100D4DB1BAC49228"/>profitable Way of improving our Time. It's true, we may read much, and profit little; while we have no Faith, or none in exercise, to mix the Word with, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.2 While, instead of laying apart all Filthiness, and Superfluity of Naughtiness, that we may receive with Meekness, the engraffed Word, which is able to save our Souls, <HI>James</HI> 1.21. We are prone to be captious and quarrelsome; and Wri∣ters as well as Preachers are a Savour of Death unto Death unto some, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.16. Instead of serious Deliberation, and solemn Self-application; deep, fixed Meditation, and fervent Prayer, before, in, and after Reading, we run over a whole Book, perhaps, without lifting the Soul up to Heaven in so much as one single Ejaculation for a Blessing. Yea, its well if our Bottom Design, in taking the Book in Hand, and glancing on here and there a Page, be not to judge the Author: at least, if we buy or borrow a good Book, at any Time, with a purpose to read it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut; our extravagant Thoughts are too much taken up, from the Title Page to the Conclu∣sion, in exalting or debasing the Writer, commend∣ing or dispraising the spiritual Food; not so much according to its real Suitableness for our Nourish∣ment and Growth in Grace, as according to the relish of our nice, vitiated, sickly Appetites. But suppose we tolerably shun these grosser Defects, in improving the Talent of good Books; yet, we content our selves in once reading them; which if we were only to judge them, is not sufficient; and in a re∣view, we may find good Reason to reverse our first Sentence, in this, as well as in many other Cases. In a Word, the main Thing is to receive the Truth in the Love of it, and bring forth Fruit with Pati∣ence.
<PB N="iv" REF="004390_0005_100D4DB3C2E349D0"/>Unless we be Doers of the Word, and not Readers only, tho' it should be with Tears of affec∣tion, it is self-deceiving; <HI>James 1.22.</HI></P>
<P>All that I shall persume to say concerning the following SERMONS is, that designing to Publish even while I was studying them, I was the more solicitous, (not knowing what nor how to write as I ought) that the allwise and good SPIRIT would please to help my Infirmities, and provide an Offering that might please himself, (who ever were displeas∣ed;) and he fit for his Use, in edifying the spiritual Building of the Church; at least, that part of it over which the Holy Ghost had made me Overseer. And if there be any Worth at all in the ensuing Pages, its wholly owing to CHRIST. Not by Flesh∣ly Wisdom; but by the Grace of GOD they are what they are. If you Reap any spiritual Benefit by the Price now in your Hands, let GOD have all the Praise; I desire but your Prayers for</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>Luke XIII. 28.</HI></BIBL>
<P>There shall be Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth, when ye shall see <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your selves thrust out.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are some Part of our Saviour's Answer to a Question, that was propounded by one of his hearers; ver. 23 <HI>Then</HI> (i. e. while he was, or when he had been Teaching, v. 22) <HI>said one unto him, Lord, are they few that be saved?</HI> Christ's Answer follows in the seven subsequent Verses; in which our Lord exhorts, or commands that they <HI>strive to enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> ver. 24 which duty of highest Importance, our Savi∣our presseth by most weighty Reasons, or Motives:
<PB N="2" REF="004390_0007_100D4DB68B5E6A68"/>The first of which is taken from the Difficulty of getting to Heaven, and the Fewness of those that shall be saved.</P>
<P>Conversion, Repentance, Faith and Holiness, Self-denial and Cross-bearing, the Yoke of O∣bedience, and Burden of Afflictions are all hard to Flesh and Blood! Many may run, few will win the Prize, many more will scuffle and beat the Air, than will overcome. <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait Gate; for many I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able,</HI> ver. 24. Many secure Sinners are awakened and stirred up by the Fear of Hell or Hope of Heaven, to take some Pains, forsake divers Lusts, and do many Things; but for want of striving more earnestly, and holding out to the End, they lose all their Labour: <HI>For the Kingdom of Heaven suf∣fereth Violence,</HI> and the Violent take it by Force: Then only shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord, We must strive against, and beat our Way thro' many and mighty Opposi∣tions; strive, even unto an Agony! Not that our own Endeavours can bring us to Heaven: Grace and Glory are God's free Gift: yet this is the Way to the Kingdom. And 'twere as good sit∣ting still as to rise up and fall.</P>
<P>'Tis our own Salvation; we must therefore work it out: Tis hard and hazardous; we must there∣fore work it out with Fear and Trembling. <HI>Many shall seek to enter in, and not be able;</HI> few then obtain what they seek for: the more Reason have we to strive. This is more expresly laid down, Mat. 7.13, 14. <HI>Enter ye in at the strait Gate, for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way
<PB N="3" REF="004390_0008_100D4DE477C4C778"/>that leadeth to Destruction; and many there be that go in thereat. Because strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life; and few there be that find it.</HI> We would not perish with an everlasting Destruction, which is the End of the broad Way; in which many walk because the Way is easie: Let us then even croud and wedge in at the strait Gate; and while Satan would improve it to discourage us from seeking, that there be so few Finders; we should strive so much the more earnestly to be of that small Number. Indeed, Whether <HI>few</HI> or <HI>many</HI> shall be saved, is not of so much Con∣cernment unto us, as that <HI>we</HI> be of the happy Number. This is the first Reason or Motive, with which Christ does back and enforce his Ex∣hortation: The second is taken from the Danger of neglecting to seek in a finding Time, ver. 25. <HI>When once the Master of the House is risen up, and hath shut to the Door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the Door, saying, Lord, Lord, Open unto us; and be shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence you are.</HI> This Argument seems to be built on such a Supposition as this; An Housholder invites many Strangers to eat and drink at his Table, or lodge in his House; warn∣ing them to be sure that they come in Season; assuring them that if they do so, his Door shall be open to them; they shall have a kind Wel∣come, and be entertained after the best Sort; The Guests come in one after another, and are received; but at length Meal-time, or Bed-time comes; the Master of the House and Feast goes himself, shuts fast the Door, and keeps out all
<PB N="4" REF="004390_0009_100D4DB8914BF698"/>who came not in Season: they shall be forced to stand without; if they knock there's no open∣ing; whatever Pleas they make all is in vain: they should have been admitted had they come sooner; but now it's too late; the Door is shut. <HI>Then shall they call on me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early</HI> (i. e. earnestly) <HI>but shall not find me. O that thou hadst known, at least in this thy Day, the Things of thy Peace; but now they are hidden from thine Eyes.</HI> The foolish Vir∣gins came to the Wedding-chamber Door; but out of Season; they knock'd, and call'd, and begg'd for Entrance, but 'twas too late. This brings us to the third and last Argument, which our blessed Saviour uses, in this Place, to per∣swade his Hearers unto the forementioned indis∣pensible Duty of striving, and necessary Means of obtaining Life and Happiness; this is taken from the dreadful Aggravations of their Exclu∣sion, who shall neglect to seek and strive, in Sea∣son and in Earnest. Now these aggravating Cir∣cumstances of being shut out, are reduceable to three or four Heads.</P>
<P>First, They shall be willing then to enter into Life on any Terms; Lord, Lord, Open to us; yet no Answer but what Bars the Door already shut against them: I know you not whence you are. Less Importunity would have obtained be∣fore; but 'tis utterly in vain now: How dread∣ful, how intolerable is this!</P>
<P>As I have read of a covetous Man who, labour∣ing of a dangerous Malady, sent for a Surgeon, and would know for how much Money, he would undertake his Cure; but not liking his
<PB N="5" REF="004390_0010_100D4DE62F3F5A28"/>Demands, lets him go: at length, his Distemper prevailing, he sends again, and offers the full Sum; now double Money is demanded; the wretched Miser is loth to go to the Cost; neg∣lects till Extremity force him to open all his Trea∣sures; but then it's too late; his Sore is incu∣rable. The Application is easy.</P>
<P>You've read the Example of <HI>Esau,</HI> and know how that (having despised his Birth-right) af∣terwards, when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected; and found no Place of Repentance, tho' he sought it carefully with Tears.</P>
<P>Again, They shall plead their Admission to Church-fellowship, Enjoyment of Gospel Privi∣ledges, attending on the Means of Grace, per∣forming the Duties of Religions, <HI>ver.</HI> 26 <HI>We have eaten and drunk in thy Presence; and thou hast taught in our Streets.</HI> In such a Plea is plain∣ly implied their confident Hopes of Acceptance with God, and a Place among the Blessed: But now to have their Suit rejected, their Pleas all invalidated, and their raised Expectations eter∣nally disappointed, (ver. 27. <HI>But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; Depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity.</HI>) How intolera∣ble is this! To live among the Saints, and pass for one, not only in our own, but in the cha∣ritable Opinion of many others, while we live, and when we come to die,— yet at last, and after all to be led forth with the Workers of Ini∣quity! This is another Aggravation of the Gos∣pel-Sinners Condemnation.</P>
<P>Moreover, The Extremity of their Torment, who perish under the Gospel, is set forth in the
<PB N="6" REF="004390_0011_100D4DBA501DE290"/>Words of our Text; <HI>There shall be Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth.</HI>— These same Expressions are used no less than six or seven Times over by one Evangelist, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.12. and 13.42, 50. and 22.13, 24, 51. and 25.30. Now these Actions are Effects of extreme Pain and Anguish, Madness and Rage, <HI>Psal.</HI> 112.10. <HI>Est.</HI> 4.3. <HI>Mark</HI> 9.8. <HI>Act.</HI> 7.54. Tis true, the Torment of the Damn∣ed does consist essentially, in their Separation from infinite Goodness; and the immediate Im∣pressions of the Almighty's Wrath: but there shall be certain biting Ingredients in their Cup, that will make the Wormwood and Gall thereof yet more bitter; among which this in the Text is not the least; <HI>Ye shall see</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your selves thrust out.</HI></P>
<P>These Words were spoken by Christ to his own Nation the Seed of <HI>Abraham;</HI> and they built much on their Relation to him: <HI>We have</HI> Abraham <HI>to our Father.</HI>— Christ knew their in∣ward Thoughts and Dependence; Luke 3.8. <HI>Begin not to say within your selves, We have</HI> Abra∣ham <HI>to our Father; for I say unto you that God is able, of these Stones, to raise up Children unto</HI> Abra∣ham. The believing Gentiles are now the spiritual Children of <HI>Abraham:</HI> the natural Branches were broken off, that we, who are by Nature of the wild Olive, might be graffed into the Stock of <HI>Abraham's</HI> Covenant. But we are fallen into the fourth and last Aggravation of their Condemnation, who were Unbelievers of the <HI>Jews, viz.</HI> that Sinners of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> should be received in their Room! v. 29, 30. <HI>And they
<PB N="7" REF="004390_0012_100D4DE946AF2A98"/>shall come from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God: And behold there are last that shall be first; and there are first that shall be last.</HI> How will it vex the Children of the King∣dom to be shut out of Doors, when Dogs (in their Esteem) shall be received into the House? But to return; These Words (as was said) were uttered by our Lord to the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> by natural Generation; and he tells them what their carnal Confidence in external Priviledges was like to come to; You shall see <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and all the Prophets; — 'Tis true, Their Father <HI>Abraham</HI> was Dead, and the Prophets were Dead, as to Men, but not as to God; foor thus our Saviour argues for the Resur∣rection against the Sadducees, Mat. 22.32. <HI>I am the God of</HI> Abraham, <HI>&amp;c. God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</HI> As sure as Christ died and rose again, so sure all that Sleep in Jusus, will God bring with him, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.14. And the Elect shall be with Christ on his right Hand, and Reprobates shall be raised also and stand at his left Hand; they shall be brought Face to Face, as it were, and see one another: <HI>Ye shall see</HI> Abra∣ham, <HI>&amp;c. in the Kingdom of God.</HI> As the Dead in Christ shall rise first, so they shall be first judged, absolved and sentenced to the prepared Kingdom, that the Wicked may see it and gnash their Teeth. First, <HI>the King shall say to them on on his right Hand, Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And then</HI> (afterwards) <HI>he shall say unto them on his left Hand, Depart from me, ye Cursed, into everlasting Fire, prepared for the
<PB N="8" REF="004390_0013_100D4DBBD95D9B48"/>Devil and his Angels,</HI> Mat. 25.34, 41. <HI>There shall be Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth, when ye shall see</HI> Abraham, <HI>and</HI> Isaac, <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>and all the Pro∣phets in the Kingdom of God, and you your selves thurst out.</HI> You that have sought to enter in, shall be thrust out: You that have eat and drunk in my Presence, and heard me Teach in your Streets, notwithstanding your Priviledges now, on which you build such aspiring Hopes: and notwithstanding your Cries then, you your selves shall be thrust out. 'Tis said indeed, Mat 25.46. <HI>These shall go away;</HI> but it is as a Malefactor goes to Execution; he is forc'd along. Now, what a cutting Thing must this be, for such as have been every Way advantaged, much every Way, for the securing of Salvation; and yet to come short, when others, enjoying but the same Means, shall receive the End of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls. This is the Matter that now falls under our Consideration, from this solemn Text! This is the Work before us! The Foundation of which I would lay in these two Doctrines.</P>

In this Doctrine there are contain'd, or im∣plied these four Propositions.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>[I.] The Elect and Reprobates, Saints and Hypocrites, do now sit together under the Means of Grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>[II.] They shall be Separated in the other World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>[III.] Their Distance shall be as great, as it is between Heaven and Hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>[IV.] This dreadful Separation shall be forced on the Wicked, sore against their Wills.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>The Elect and Reprobates, Saints and Hypocrites, do now sit together under the Means of Grace.</HI> Ezek. 33.31. <HI>They sit before thee as my People, and they hear thy Words.</HI> Mat. 13.30. <HI>Let both grow together till the Harvest.</HI> When we behold a Congregation of professed Christians, tho' we dare not ordinarily look on any Person in it, and say, We know that Man or Woman to be unconverted; nor may we be infallibly certain that any Number of them have experien∣ced a saving Change: Yet we may conclude that such as attend the Means of Grace together, are of these two sorts, Mat. 25.1, 2. <HI>Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten Virgins, which took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom: And five of them were wise, and five were Foolish.</HI></P>
<P>If you enquire, Whence is it, that the same Means prove effectual to the Conversion and Sal∣vation of some; and ineffectual to others?</P>
<P>I answer;</P>
<P N="1">1. It's thro' the Faith of some, and the Un∣belief of others. Act. 28.23, 24. <HI>And when they had appointed him a Day, there came many into his
<PB N="10" REF="004390_0015_100D4DBDE36497B8"/>Lodging, to whom he expounded and testified the Kingdom of God; perswading them concerning Jesus, both out of the Law of Moses, and out of the Prophets, from Morning to Evening; And some believed the Things that were spoken, and some believed not.</HI> Joh. 1.11, 12. <HI>He came to his own, and his own received him not: But as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of GOD, even to the Believers on his Name.</HI> Mark 16.16. <HI>He that Believes and is Baptised shall be saved; but he that Believeth not shall be Damned.</HI> Heb. 3.18, 19 <HI>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his Rest, but to them that believed not? So we see they could not enter in because of Unbelief.</HI> Heb. 4.2. <HI>For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them; but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</HI> 1 Thes. 2.13 <HI>When ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us; ye received it not as the Word of Man; but as it is in Truth the Word of God; which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</HI> If Men did humbly and diligently wait on God under the precious Means of Grace, and faithful∣ly receive the Truth they hear, in the Love of it; the Truth would sanctify and save them: but God has resolved that all shall be Damned, who believe not the Truth; but have Pleasure in Unrighteousness. And how justly are Unbe∣lievers made to take their Part with all Liars, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone; seeing they have made God a Liar, because they have not believed the Record God has given of his Son. Thus <HI>Israel</HI> destroys himself doubly, by refusing the Help of him who is mighty to Save</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="004390_0016_100D4DECF3C49FE0"/>
2. Satan, (when and where he is permitted so to do) can and does hinder the Efficacy of the Means. This wicked One is still present with us while we hear the Word of the Kingdom; and has a thousand Ways to hinder our profit∣ing thereby; when he cannot divert us from attending thereon. He has Power to work in∣ternally on our Fancies, as well as to steal away our Thoughts and Affections by every external Object. He can recal into our Mind Things past, and ingage the Invention and Affections about the Imployments and Injoyments that are fu∣ture. This subtil Crafts-master knows how to insinuate Prejudices against the Preacher; or if we admire him, and highly commend the Ser∣mon; that shall pass for doing the Word; espe∣cially if we can remember a considerable Part of the Sermon, tho' we never practise any of it. Satan has, no doubt, a great Hand in it at least, when by any of these, or the like Ways we de∣ceive our own Souls. Jam. 1.21, 22. <HI>Wherefore lay apart all Filthiness, and Superfluity of Naughti∣ness; and receive with Meekness, the engraffed Word, which is able to save your Souls: But be ye Doers of the Word and not Hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</HI> He joins also with our deceitful Hearts, while our Thoughts are busie in making Application of what we hear, to others; This is for such an one; and it may be that very Person thinks we should do well to take it to our selves; and so both the one and the other loseth the Benefit of a seasonable Truth, for want of Self-application. Again, Our watchful Adversary takes the Advantage of our Heedlessness and
<PB N="12" REF="004390_0017_100D4DC0F912D318"/>Ignorance: Mat. 13.19. <HI>When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked One, and catcheth away that which was sown in his Heart.</HI> How great soever our natural Darkness is in spiritual Things; yet this Prince of Darkness has Power to increase it; 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the God of this World hath blindeth the Minds of them that believe not, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, the Destroyer of Souls will, if possible, keep out Conviction, and prevent the new Birth, by hindering Conception: But if once the secure Soul be alarm'd by Conviction, then Satan be∣stirs himself to put out this Fire: and has as many Devices in carrying on this Part of his hellish Trade as the other: he'll perswade the sad Soul to make use of merry Company, as an happy Expedient to drive away Melancholy; while he fills the Head and Heart with a thousand Cares and Fears about the Body, and Things of the present Life.

Indeed we have lost all Power and Will to spiritual Good; and for that very Reason, God may justly require what we are not able to per∣form; because he once gave us a Sufficiency of Strength to do his whole Will; and tho' we had not this Stock in our own Hands, yet 'twas in the Hands of our own natural Father, whose Interest was greater in securing it, than ours could be: And you know, if a wealthy Parent should, in a mad Fit, throw his Treasures into the Sea, set Fire to his Houses, alienate his Lands, and dye deeply in Debt, his Children must be poor and miserable.

<P>Moreover, The new and living Way of Sal∣vation, by Faith in Christ; the Way that infinite Wisdom has laid out; requires that the Tenders of Life be made indefinitely to Nations, Places, Congregations and Families of Elect and Repro∣bates together; there would be else no ground of Faith in the conditional Promise, Mark 16.15, 16. <HI>Preach the Gospel to every Creature.

Look to him and thou shalt be saved. And the more vile and forlorn and desperate thy Case, as to Man, may be; tho' thy Soul is bleeding to Death at ten Thousand mortal Wounds, thou art but the fitter Object for the great Physician to glorisy his Skill upon, 1 Tim. 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. <HI>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the World
<PB N="22" REF="004390_0027_100D4DCB66C648E8"/>to save Sinners, of whom I am chief.</HI> Only abuse not this Grace of God, which brings Salvation no otherwise than as it teaches to deny Ungod∣liness and worldly Lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godlily in the World: Not in our own Strength; but by his Power, who work∣eth in us to will and to do of his own good Pleasure. You may be bold with Christ; but not with Sin.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>The Elect and Reprobates, Saints and Hypocrites, (tho' they now enjoy g spel Privil∣edges, and fit under the Means of Grace together,</HI> as we have heard; <HI>yet they</HI>) <HI>shall be separated in the other World.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Their immortal Souls shall be seperated at Death.</HI> As they live together, so they may die together; the Time, the Place, the Manner, and all external Circumstances of their Death may be the same: and not only so; but the internal Concomitants thereof may be, in some Respects the same also; for, as they have lived and civilly conversed together in the World, so they have maintained religious Communion with one another: They have pray'd and fasted to∣gether, heard Sermons and received the Sacra∣ment together; (tho' with different Frames, and quite contrary Ends) and when they come to die, the Hypocrite's Hope, such as it is, may hold out as well as the sound Christian's: He may have inward Peace, and die like a Lamb, as they say: Yea, he may seem to have the Advantage of the assaulted Christian; against whom Satan comes with great Wrath, knowing he has but a short Time: And GOD for holy
<PB N="23" REF="004390_0028_100D4DF962B1CA48"/>Ends may hide his Face, or look with a frown∣ing Countenance on his dear Child, the very Hour that he receives his departing Spirit into everlasting Arms of Mercy; whenas the Wicked have no Bands in their Death: when a strong Man armed keepeth his Palace, his Goods are in Peace: A deceived Heart turn'd him aside from the strait Gate of Conversion at his first setting out, and led him out of the way of true Peace all his Life long; and now at last conspires with Satan, and carnal or over-charitable Relations and Visitants, to send him out of the World in a false Dream: God is Merciful; Christ died for Sinners; Thou hast lived well, and done Good in thy Generation; All have their Failings! Thus a false Title to an eternal Kingdom is easily prov'd, in a blind Court; when the right Heir of Salvation may have all call'd in Ques∣tion; many false Allegations, by the Accuser of of the Brethren brought in against him; Thou hast done just nothing for God, but much against him; in all thy fair out-side Shows and Forma∣lities, Self was at the bottom; thou didst never make God's Glory thy pure single Aim in any one Duty of Piety, Righteousness, or Charity; much less in the Course of thy Life; and dost not thou know, besides all this, (says Satan) the Wickedness that thine own Heart is privy to; what thou hast been, and done; both before, and since thy hypocritical Profession? Thus, I say, the Child of Light tho' passing safely to eternal Day, may, have his Sun ev'n setting in a Cloud; his Evidences so blotted, that he is ev'n forc'd to quit Claim to the Inheritance of
<PB N="24" REF="004390_0029_100D4DCD08D932A0"/>the Saints; or at least may die between Hope and Despair.</P>
<P>In a Word; both the thorough Christian and the Formalist may be either willing or afraid to die; and when the living Soul is departed, the dead Corps of the one and the other lie together in the same Burying-Place; but their Souls shall be separated: they don't ascend to Heaven to∣gether; nor sink down to the bottomless Pit to∣gether; nor continue wandring in the lower Region of the Air together: but are dispatch'd to distant Places, and far more different States: (of which in the next <HI>Proposition;</HI>) Thus their Souls are separated at Death. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Their whole Persons shall be separated at the Day of Judgment.</HI> When, and where, and how∣soever the Godly and the Wicked have ended their Days on Earth; how ever their dead Bo∣dies have been disposed of; whether burn'd to Ashes, or devour'd by wild Beasts, Fishes, or Worms: when Christ shall come to his last Judg∣ment, all shall rise again, both the Just and Un∣just; and tho' the <HI>dead</HI> in Christ shall rise first, yet we shall all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ, to give an Account of our Works, and to receive a Reward according to them: In or∣der to which, the Omniscient, Impartial Judge will make an exact Separation between the Righ∣teous and the Wicked, the Upright and Unsound. They may grow together till the Harvest, but no longer; tho' one Field may hold the Tares, and the Wheat, yet not one Garner: The Chaff is of use to preserve the good Grain in the Field and Mow; and after Threshing they lie together
<PB N="25" REF="004390_0030_100D4DFB7547F038"/>for a small space; but when winnowing Day comes, the Chaff shall be driven away: he who has his Fan in his Hand, will throughly purge his Floor: there shall not be left so much as one Hull of Chaff among the Wheat; or one Grain of Wheat carried away with the Chaff. A Scheme of this great Days Work we have, Rev. 20.11, 12, 13. Mat 25.31,—<HI>When the Son of Man shall come in his Glory and all the Holy Angels with him, then shall be sit on the Throne of his Glory; and before him shall be gathered all Na∣tions; and he shall separate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats. And he shall set the Sheep on his right Hand; but the Goats on the left.</HI></P>
<P>The Wicked (tho' they had little Cause for it) hated the Godly, and thrust them out while on Earth; and now, when they would fain creep in among them, they shall be thrust out; they shall be offended at their Company no more.</P>
<P>The Godly, on the other Hand, while they were in their militant State, could not wholly re∣frain the unpleasant infecting Society of the Wicked, unless they would go out of the World: but now their righteous Souls shall be no more vexed with the filthy Conversation of the Wick∣ed: nor shall they have so much as one seeming Saint in their heavenly Fellowship, to lose their Love upon: They shall doubtless <HI>miss</HI> many whom they expected to have seen at Christ's Right Hand; but they shall <HI>suspect</HI> none that are there.

Now, if the Bodies of the Damned shall be tormented with material Fire and Brim∣stone, it must needs be dreadful! As, if we should see a great Copper containing the quantity of many Tuns, fill'd with Brimstone; then melted over a mighty Fire; then set on a Flame, as you have seen a Kettle of boiling Tarr in the Ship-wrights Yard; and Men, Women and Children thrown into it alive; this would be terrible to the Beholders; much more to the Persons thus executed; though the Pain and Horror would in this case, be over in a few Minutes: how <HI>intolerably</HI> dreadful will it be then for Sinners to be <HI>cast alive</HI> (as 'tis said <HI>they</HI> shall be) <HI>into a Lake of Fire, burning with Brimstone,</HI> Rev 19.20. So Mat. 13.40, 42, 43. <HI>As there∣fore the Tares are gathered and burnt in the Fire; so shall it be in the End of the World: The Son of Man shall send sorth bis Angels, and they shall ga∣ther out of bis Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity: and shall cast them into a Furnace of Fire.</HI> Rev. 20.15. <HI>And wohsoevet was not found written in the Book of Life, was cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Suppose the Water of some large and deep Pond were turned into boiling, flaming Brimstone; and the Devils, in visible Shapes should be suf∣fered to drag our Neighbours and Friends, one
<PB N="31" REF="004390_0036_100D4E02124DBAE0"/>after another, according as the Measure of their Sins should be silled up, and cast them away a∣live into that boiling Pond; Oh! How terrible would this be to the poor Wretches, and to the Beholders? How doleful their Shrieks, and fearful Lamentations! How would it Pierce even an Heart of Stone, to see this acted before their Eyes, in the open Day; or to hear the dismal Cries of our Neighbours, drag'd along the Streets before our Doors by Night; and dearest Relati∣ons hawl'd out of their Beds, and carried away by main Strength, to that supposed Hell on Earth: And suppose further, that God should keep them alive in that fiery Pond, from one Year and Age to another; and we could walk safely by the Sides of, it and round it, and see the poor, undone Creatures swimming about in the midst of the Flames; and hear their fruitless Cries for one drop of Water; as the rich Man, Luk. 16.23, 24. <HI>And in Hell he lift up his Eyes being in Torment; and seeth</HI> Abraham <HI>afar off, and</HI> Lazarus <HI>in his Bo∣som: And he criedand said, Father</HI> Abraham, <HI>have mercy on me, and send</HI> Lazarus, <HI>that he may dip the tip of his Finger in Water and cool my Tongue, for I am tormented in this Flame.</HI> What Ada∣mantine Heart would not bleed at such a Sight and Sound! Now what is acted invisibly every Day is indeed more amazingly dreadful, if we could realize it: For, what ever the Body could suffer in these material Flames, the suffering of immortal Souls must needs be greater; and Souls are dragg'd to Hell by Multitudes, of all Nations every Day: As the Soul (we know by Experience) can taste much higher Delight
<PB N="32" REF="004390_0037_100D4DD5A4207190"/>in God, than the Body can enjoy in the sweetest Pleasures of Sense; so why should not the Soul be capable of suffering more bitter Torments than can be inflicted on the Body? <HI>The Spirit of a Man</HI> (saith the sacred Text) <HI>will sustain his Infirmities;</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> bodily Infirmities; as holy Martyrs have sung for Joy at the Stake) <HI>but a wounded Spirit who can bear? Who knows the Power of thy Anger? According to thy Fear, so is thy Wrath.</HI> The Heart of Man is not capable of apprehending such Terrors as God can inflict: <HI>While I suffer thy Terrors, I am distracted,</HI> said a holy Man under Apprehensions of divine Wrath. What would the Damned then say, if they could speak out all they feel under the immediate Im∣pressions of Fury incensed to the uttermost, with∣out the least allay of so much as sparing Mercy? — And, as for the Body if there shall be no ma∣terial Fire in Hell to burn it; if those inexpres∣sible Torments are only shadowed out by flaming Brimstone because this is most dreadful to Sense; as the Glory of Heaven is metaphorically set forth by eating Bread and Drinking Wine, Feasting, Singing, and Nuptial Joys; then it will follow, that the Torments of the Damned will be un∣speakably greater than it could be to lie frying in the hottest Fire, World without End, — As the Joys of Heaven are above the Joys of Marriage, Victory, Feasting and Harvest; and that glorious City of God above more beautiful, rich and magnificent than such an one as <HI>John</HI> saw, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. A City of pure Gold, like clear Glass; the Walls of Jasper; the Foun∣dations garnished with all manner of precious
<PB N="33" REF="004390_0038_100D4E042B25C6C0"/>Stones; the twelve Gates of entire Pearls: hav∣ing a pure River running through the City clear as Chrystal; and in the midst of the Street of it, (which also was paved with Gold as it were transparent Glass) and on either side the River was there the Tree of Lise, which bare twelve manner of Fruits, and yielded her Fruit every Month; and the Leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations: So, why may not the Torments of Hell as far exceed those of a material Lake of Fire, as Heaven shall transcend the Beauty and Glory of such a City? Especial∣ly if we consider how God will set himself to glorify his Power as well as Justice on the Dam∣ned for ever, <HI>Rom</HI> 9.22.2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.9. Now if we can't bear the Top of a Finger, for a few Minutes, in the Flame of a Candle, much less an Hand or Foot in a fiery Oven; what will it be to be swallowed up in a flaming Lake of the most terrible, raging Fire? Sure they can have no Rest, Day nor Night, the Smoke of whose Torment ascends for ever and ever. But, as I said, it is the Suffering of the Soul, the immortal Soul of the Damned Sinner, that is (as one ex∣presses it) the very Soul of his Sufferings: God's Fury shall be poured out like Fire on the naked Soul, lying open to the heavy Strokes of his mighty Arm; that almighty Arm that made the World, stretched forth the Heavens as a Curtain, and weighs the Mountains in Scales; what heavy Blows can such an Arm strike! Oh! it must needs be <HI>a fearful Thing to fall into the Hand of the living God!</HI> Tis dreadful, to fall into the Paws of tearing Lions and Bears robbed of their
<PB N="34" REF="004390_0039_100D4DD82CF27840"/>Whelps; the Hands of wicked Men and cursed Devils; but all is nothing to the Wrath of the Almighty; when his abused Mercy shall all turn into Fury and fiery Indignation: So that the Generation of his Wrath must endure intolerable Pains, without the least Intermission or Mitiga∣tion: It will be impossible for them to divert their Tho'ts for so much as one poor Moment, for Millions of Millions of Ages, from the most do∣lorous Subject of their Wo and Misery. If they could slumber a few Minutes, or sleep one wink in all that eternal Night, so as but to Dream of present Ease or a future End of their Torments, it might seem to yield some shadow of Relief: but neither can that be; nor shall they ever have a Friend in Heaven or Hell, to speak half a Word of Comfort in their Ears: If the Rich Man had not had his good Things to the very last Dropt, in this World, he had not been denied the cold Comfort of a little Water to cool the tip of his Tongue, in Hell's Flame.</P>
<P>Moreover, The Damned shall then know as∣suredly (tho' they now reason to the contrary) that their Destruction is of themselves: it shall be evident to them, that all this intolerable, reme∣diless interminable Misery is the Fruit of their own wilful Folly: Could they but think and be preswaded in themselves, that the Decree of God had forced them to Sin, they might fancy some Relief in such a blasphemous Thought; but the whole weight of Guilt will lie and bear on their own Consciences; (of which more in the <HI>Second Doctrine</HI>) Indeed they shall be forced to bear the just Demerit of their Sins; which is the last Pro∣position under this <HI>First Doctrine.</HI></P>

PROP. IV. <HI>This dreadful Separation shall be forc∣ed on the Wicked, sore against their Wills.</HI> They shall be thrust out! When Persons voluntarily forsake, or fairly take leave of their Company, and walk out of Doors, they are not said to be thrust out: But these shall be turned out by Force and driven away. Not that they shall now be∣gin to love the Lord Jesus Christ, and such as he is not ashamed to call his Brethren: 'Tis not from any spiritual Affection to holy Persons or Employments, that they shall be averse to this Separation and Exclusion; but altogether from Self-Love and the dread of Hell-Fire, enkind∣led by divine Anger, which who knows the Power of? According to his Fear so is his Wrath. This will force the foolish Virgins to cry, Lord, Lord, open to us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.11. And the Guests that come too late, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.25. to make the same exceeding bitter and fruitless Cry. And if they turn to the Rocks and Mountains, (<HI>Rev.</HI> 6.15, 16, 17.) They will also be deaf to their Request. Their Sentence is dreadful, (<HI>Mat</HI> 25.41. Go ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels;) but hear it they must: and Execution must be done, as sure as ever the Sentence is pronounced: These shall go away into Everlasting Punishment, <HI>ver.</HI> 46. The Wicked shall be turned into Hell; and all the Nations that forget God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 9.17. They shall be bound Hand and Foot, and cast into Outer Darkness, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.13. They loved the Com∣pany of the Saints on Earth only with a carnal Affection or Liking, and for Self-Ends; and now at last, they can no more delight in perfect Holi∣ness
<PB N="36" REF="004390_0041_100D4DD9B62A8038"/>then they could in their imperfect Sancti∣fication on Earth, not being renewed and made holy themselves: So that Heaven it self would be an uneasy Place to them, if such defiled ones could be admitted into the holy City: and to keep an eternal Sabbath in nothing but holy Exercises (for carnal Professors, who seem to rejoyce in Hopes of going to Heaven, have very gross and wrong Conceptions of the Nature of its Glory and Happiness) must needs be tiresome to such as say of the short Intervals of holy Time, When will they be over and gone, that we may be in (our Element) the Employments and En∣joyments of the World again? <HI>Amos</HI> 8.5. And of every holy Service, Behold, what a Weariness is it? <HI>Mal</HI> 1.13. Yet for an unholy Heart (that hates God, and can never love any that have the Image of Christ, as such) to be confin∣ed with an holy Society, and to heavenly Ex∣ercises, tho' it be far less desirable to such an one, than an earthly Paradise; yet is it more tole∣rable than to lie down in Sorrow, and dwell with everlasting Burnings. Thus the Separation that shallbe made another Day between Saints and Hypocrites, shall be forced on the Reprobates, sore against their Will. And thus we have finish∣ed the Doctrinal Part of the <HI>First Point.</HI></P>

It's true, the revelation of Heaven's Glory does little affect christless Sinners now, because of their great Darkness and Infidelity. As the ungospel∣lized World know nothing of the holy City; so all unconverted Christians are great Strangers to that future, glorious State. Carnal Professors may speak much about Heaven; and Men of Learn∣ing write whole Volumns concerning the State of the Blessed in the other World; but they know nothing experimentally of the matter as holy Souls do. A Day in God's Courts, or one Hour's Com∣munion with Christ at his Table; Yea, a quarter of an Hour's Fellowship of the Spirit, in Closet Prayer, or Evening Meditation, does give the most illiterate true Believer to understand more of Heaven, than many Years study of the acutest Doctor, from whose carnal Wisdom these Things are hid.</P>
<P>Holy Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> profess'd, that he knew more of the Life of Heaven, by the ravishing Foretastes he had of Glory, in one solitary Journey in the way of divine Meditation, than ever he learned by all the Books he had read, and Discourses he had entertained about it.</P>
<P>Heaven consists mainly in the satisfaction of holy Desires and Longings, which the unsanctified know nothing of. They may think it a good Thing, and great, to be equal to Angels, in Ho∣nours and Delights; To be free from Pain, Want, Labour, Care and Fear; and to be filled with Joy; but what that Joy is, they apprehend not; and the Nature and Taste of the Water of Life, they are wholly Strangers to: 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the
<PB N="38" REF="004390_0043_100D4DDBC98C61B8"/>Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can be know them, because they are spiritually dis∣cerned.</HI> Yea, even gracious Souls (the best of them all) see now but through a Glass darkly; and the most have but small Sips: — <HI>If so be ye have Tasted,</HI> — 1 Pet. 2.3. It does not yet appear, to the high raised Apprehension of the most heavenly Christian, what he shall be. 1 Joh. 3.2 <HI>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God; and it does not yet appear what we shall be.</HI> How in∣seriour then must the Apprehensions of Repro∣bates (whose Eyes the God of this World hath blinded) needs be, of the Happiness of glorifyed Saints; if they would allow themselves Time to think on such a Subject: But no sooner shall their bodily Eyes be closed, than those of their Mind shall be fully opened, to take a clear View of their own Misery, and to apprehend very much of the Saints Felicity.</P>
<P>More Particularly: <HI>First,</HI> The Damned in Hell have the fullest. Knowledge that can be, by Sense and Experience, of that Evil which the Saints are delivered from. Now herein consists a great Part of the Saints Happiness in Heaven: for if there be Pain of Loss as well as Sense in the Damned, there must be a proportionable Joy of Deliverance, as well as Fruition, in the Saved. A very great Part, no doubt, of the ravishing Joy and Extasies of Love, that, the glorifyed are transported with, arises from the Consideration of what they are perfectly and for ever saved from; even the Pains of Hell, and the Blasphemies of the Dam∣ned; some Taste of which they had under the
<PB N="39" REF="004390_0044_100D4E0AAFD773A8"/>Spirit of Bondage, and from Satan's fiery Darts; (yea, and out of their own Hearts also have proceeded Blasphemies;) and more is understood of the Power of God's Anger, in the State of perfect Knowledge; yet there can be no humane Knowledge like that of Experience: The Dam∣ned have reason to know what a Felicity it would be to be saved from Wrath; and are now con∣vinced, by most cogent Arguments, that Heaven, considered only as it is described, Rev. 21.4. <HI>And God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there shall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither shall there be any more Pain;</HI> it was well worth the seeking. Thus the Dam∣ned must needs have most large and quick Ap∣prehensions of one Part of the Saints Happiness in Heaven. As the saved best know, what lost Souls have lost with their Souls; so, on the con∣trary, as was said.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Damned will for ever remem∣ber what they shall have seen and heard, of the beginning of the Saints Happiness, after the Re∣surrection, before their final Separation. With what beautiful, shining, glorious Bodies they are raised: what Joy appears in their Countenance: how congratulated by Angels and Fellow Saints: what dear Love Christ expresses to them; and what Honour he does visibly and openly put upon them; while they are caught up in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, and to sit at his right Hand, as Assessors in Judgment 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.17. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.2, 3. And they shall hear all their Graces and Duties, of active and passive O∣bedience, especially their Alms-Deeds, honour∣ably
<PB N="40" REF="004390_0045_100D4DDD697E0E18"/>and particularly mentioned, to a Cup of cold Water, given to any out of christian, brotherly Love: all their Care and Diligence to please GOD, and honour Christ in the World, and do Good in their Generatian; every Prayer that they have made in secret Corners; all their hear∣ty Sighs and Groans under the Burden of Sin; and inward Desires and Longings after, and Delight in Christ, Sabbaths, Ordinances, and Christian Conference, shall be mentioned before the World: And then shall the King say to them on his right Hand, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you before the Foundation of the World:</HI> and all in the hearing of wretched Cast-aways, that their Judgment may be the more clear, and their Condemnation the more aggravated: For the perfect remem∣brance of so much of the happy, glorious State and Case of the Saints, at the last Day, as they have been made to see and know, before their entrance into Blackness of Darkness, shall remain with them for ever, to help keep alive a Sense of what they have lost, by their Folly and Unbelief.</P>
<P>And then, <HI>Thirdly;</HI> Their Understandings will be greatly inlarged to take in, who can tell what Ideas of Heaven's Glory, and the Saints Felicity, for their own endless Vexation. If the Unsanctified may, by common Illumination, know something of the Powers of the World to come, here, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.5. Hereafter (though they shall taste nothing of the Goodness of God's Word past, yet) they shall know more of the World then come, unspeaka∣bly more than now can enter into their Hears to
<PB N="41" REF="004390_0046_100D4E0CC8F17D60"/>conceive. As their Bodies shall be strengthned to endure the hottest Fire of God's burning Wrath, without consuming a jot; so their Ap∣prehensions may be proportionably inlarged, a∣bove what they now can reach unto; and their Memories may be strengthned to recal and retain every aggravating Circumstance of all their Sin on Earth, Luk. 16.25. <HI>Son Remember,</HI>—</P>
<P>We know that Thought and Consideration is essential to the humane Nature; and it is known, by universal Experience, that by this natural Power of the Soul, we are able to bring Things out of Sight, and at the greatest Distance; yea, Things past or future, and purely spiritual too (as well, though not so easily as the Objects of Sense) into plain View as it were before our Eyes; or as if such Things were sounding in our Ears. Thus, when a Man is on a desolate Island at Sea, or close Prisoner in a strange Land; how sensibly does he represent to himself the happy Freedom of others, in their own beloved Coun∣try, commodious Habitations, with Meat and Drink to the full, and change of Raiment; warm Beds; their Wives with them, and Children a∣bout them; while himself is destitute of all these Comforts; and this makes his Iron Fetters to eat into his very Soul: how much more in the Case before us, in which not only is the dis∣proportion a million Times greater, but the Capa∣city also of apprehending, comparing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall be inconceiveably inlarged; and the Damned, as was said, have nothing to divert them from a con∣stant, deep and fixed Meditation on this very Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="004390_0047_100D4DDF44B185D8"/>
It remains yet to be considered, more distinct∣ly, how these Apprehensions of the Damned in Hell, concerning the Saints Happiness in Heaven, shall aggravate their own eternal Misery. That their Misery shall be Eternal is evident from many plain Scriptures, that have been already mentioned; and it must of necessity be so, for in Hell God will not punish them less than their Iniquities deserve, which are infinite, in regard of the Object against whom they are committed: Now it being impossible that a finite Creature should, in the longest space of Time, make full Satisfaction to an infinite GOD, (as Christ, who was an infinite Person, did for the Elect) there∣fore their Punishment must be infinite in Dura∣tion: besides, the earnest Wish, and hearty De∣sire of every Bond-slave of Satan is, that he might live for ever on Earth, in Health, Honour and Prosperity, that so he might fulfil the Desires of the Flesh and the Mind, (<HI>i. e.</HI> that he might Sin) for ever. So that there is a Sort of Infinite∣ness in the Evil of Sin: Nothing indeed, if we speak absolutely, can be infinitely Evil: there is but one Infinite, and he is infinitely Good: Yet, Reprobates are as it were guilty of an infinite Evil; both as Sin is contrary to the Nature, Will and Honour of a Being, infinite in Great∣ness and Goodness, Equity and Holiness; and also, in that there is a Disposition to Sin, in such as are not changed, that will never cease; but if the Sinner were under a I aw to Eternity, he would be a Transgressor to Eternity; if God should heap Mercies on him to Eternity, he would abuse them to Eternity. Now the least
<PB N="43" REF="004390_0048_100D4E0EE1453258"/>Degree of Torment, to last for ever, is horrible to think of! Such as never had sufficient Means of Salvation; that never once rebelled against the Light of the Gospel, though (dying Christ∣less) their Punishment will be more tolerable than ours if we die in Unbelief; yet to lie in the softest Fire for ever, how Dismal! Yea, if it were but to undergo the grievous Pain of a Tooth, for ever and for ever, it would tire out the long∣est Patience! But now, when all the bitter, bit∣ing, stinging Ingredients imaginable, and far beyond conceit, shall be com-mixed in the Cup of divine Wrath, for the Gospel-Sinner to drink off: what Tongue can express, or Heart con∣ceive one thousand millionth Part of their pain∣ful Anguish! If we could suppose that all the Angels had fallen, and all the Race of <HI>Adam</HI> had perished remedilesly; so that there had been no <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bosom, nor <HI>Lazarus</HI> to have lien in it; no glorified Saint or Angel, with whose Happiness to have compared our Misery; yet eternal Damnation would have made every Fugi∣tive from God to cry out, <HI>My Punishment is greater than I can bear!</HI> But they are not Suppo∣sitions, they are Realities that we have to do with: and the Aggravation of the Misery of some, arising from their Apprehension of the Happiness of others, their Fellow-Creatures, and once Fellow-Sinners, may be considered, first, more Generally, as it concerns all the Damned; and then more Particularly, as it concerneth such as perish from under the Gospel.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="44" REF="004390_0049_100D4E10B6BB3B00"/>
I. More Generally.</P>
<P>The Gentile Nations that perished (by Thou∣sands and Millions) for lack of Vision, for so ma∣ny Ages, while God (in a way of New-Covenant Mercy) knew only the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, the Seed of <HI>Abraham;</HI> giving his Word to <HI>Jacob,</HI> his Statutes and Judgments to <HI>Israel:</HI> All these Nations (I say) whom God suffered to walk in their own Ways, will be inraged with self-tormenting Madness, that the Lord should send all his Servants the Prophets unto <HI>Jacob</HI> whom he loved, and make his Word in their Mouth, effectual to the Conversion and Salvation of so many Thousands of them; while these Sinners of the Gentiles could not hear for want of a Preacher, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14. And the Ungospellized Nations, now since Christ came and brake down the Partition Wall between <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> will have the same bitter Pill to chew, while they consider how that some in all Ages, of one Na∣tion or other, and some of all Nations, in one Age or other, are redeemed and saved; this will make them lament and blaspheme, that the Gospel was not sent to their Nation, and in their Day on Earth. Now to take the whole World of Reprobates together, in what ever Age or Nation they lived, that perish either for lack of Vision, or for rebelling against the Light of Na∣ture and Scripture both; we may a little consi∣der, in a more general Way, how it will vex and torment all the Damned, while they view and survey in their Heaven-piercing Thoughts, the Place and State of the Glorified; and consider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="45" REF="004390_0050_100D4E45F9B25320"/>
1. That there was a possibility of their having been all happy, as well as they that are so, or instead of them; there being nothing in the Nature of God or Man against it. Indeed, the Purposes of God are unalterable; it being im∣possible that he should see any manner of Cause or Reason, in Time, to change his Mind, which he saw not perfectly from Eternity to have hindered his purposing any Thing but what he should resolvedly bring to pass, in its Season: and in this respect, its impossible that any one Thing in the World should be any otherwise than it is, has been, and shall be: and on the other Hand, 'tis, in it self, a Thing possible with God to turn the Devils into holy Angels again; and doubtless the eternal remembrance of what they once were, and what their then Fellow-Servants now unchangeably are, does double their own Torment and Vexation; as well as Christ's tak∣ing on him, not the angelical but human Nature. But now the Case is different with Men; they were all alike ruined in the first <HI>Adam;</HI> and alike capable of recovery by the second: so that Thousands of Millions will say, in Hell (and vex themselves for ever with such fruitless Wishes) Oh! That the Gospel of Salvation had been sent to us: Oh! That we had but heard the joyful Sound: Oh! That we had lived in such Times and Places as were blessed with Sab∣baths, Ministers and Bibles. And ten thousand Times ten Thousand, Oh! That the Gospel had been made effectual to us: But more of this afterwards.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="46" REF="004390_0051_100D4E131FFBD208"/>
2. There are the same natural and vehement Desires, and Thirstings of Soul after Happiness in them that are saved and in them that perish. By Nature they are both alike capable of, and the one as well as the other eager in pursuing after Happiness: Only this is the Happiness of the Elect; when God is effectually calling such as he had Fore-known and Predestinated, he opens their Eyes and causes them to see and know that Happiness does not lie in the Pleasures, Profits and Honours of the World that now is, where they have been climbing high, digging deep, and turning every Stone, in search of this Treasure; till the Spirit of Grace and Truth conducts them into the Field where it lies hid from all natural Men, who are yet solicitously inquisitive after the chiefest Good of the rational Creature; Psal. 4, 6, 7. <HI>Many there be that say, Who will shew us any Good? Lord, life thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us: Thou hast put, gladness in my Heart, more than in the time that their Corn and their Wine increased.</HI> Corn is our natural Life and Strength; Wine is the joy of Man's Heart: The former one of the most necessary, the latter one of the most excellent Products of the Earth; yet both, together with all overflowing abundance of Milk and Honey, Silver and Gold, make up but an empty and transient Felicity for an immortal Spirit. Where is the Blessedness you spake of? May the deceiv∣ed Worldling say to himself, on his Bed on Sor∣row, when the Night of Death has overtaken him: (for when his Sparks of worldly Wisdom and Wealth, or legal Righteousness are gone out,
<PB N="47" REF="004390_0052_100D4E4929E69000"/>he must <HI>lie down in Sorrow;</HI> the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it; this shall <HI>ye have of mine Hand,</HI> Isa. 50.11) Hadst thou not an Under∣standing to distinguish between Light and Dark∣ness; a Will to chuse the Good and refuse the Evil; Affections to embrace a suitable, satisfy∣ing, immortal Good; an hungry Soul panting after some living Spring, and boundless Ocean, to fill its immense Desires? And couldest thou find nothing but Husks and Dust of the Earth, the Swine and Serpents Meat, to feed upon? Who knows the Power that these Self-reflections will have, to Torment undone Reprobates of all Times and Places, Nations and Generations, from first to last? They were naturally alike capable of eternal Felicity with others; and had the same vehement, incessant Desires to be Hap∣py: Yea, this Capacity, and these Desires too will remain with them for ever, to increase their Torment: For though we can't Hope for a Good we know unattainable, yet we may Desire it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Truth in Hand, thus generally consi∣dered, is further evident from our own Experi∣ence, in the trifles of this vain World and mo∣mentany Life. The Trouble and Vexation of proud, discontented Folks under their Afflictions and Crosses; Poverty, and low, despicable Cir∣cunstances is more than doubled by the conside∣ration of the Riches and Prosperity, Ease and Preferment of others, whom they envy. If none were above them they would not think them∣selves low, though on the same level they now are. <HI>Rachel's</HI> want of Children had been a tolerable Evil, if <HI>Leah</HI> also and the Handmaids

The Principle from which we are most strongly inclined, thus to rub our Sores with Salt and Vinegar, is rooted in our very Nature: We see the Fruits of it in our Children, when they are very little, and as they grow up: How discontented is one little One in the Family with his old Coat, when his Brother first puts on a new one; though he made no com∣plaint before: if we give but an Apple to one he rejoyces, but then give two unto another and the first will think he has less than none, unless he may be made equal with his Mate. The elder brother in the Parable nurmurs, because the younger is so joyfully received and entertained. The Case of <HI>Josepb</HI> and his Brethren serves fur∣ther to illustrate and comfirm the Matter: You know how to apply it.</P>
<P N="2">II. We come now, more particularly to con∣sider the inexpressible Vexation and Anguish of Gospel-Sinners in Hell; unconceivably aggra∣vated from the clear and large Apprehensions they shall have of the Saints Happiness in Hea∣ven. We know that the Essence of Damnation, of the Torments of Hell, does consist in the Sin∣ners Separation from the infinitely glorious JEHOVAH, the only satisfying Portion of the immortal, heaven-born Soul; and the immediate Impressions of his Wrath, who is a consuming Fire: The loss of the Society both of Saints and Angels is small to this, if we consider them as separable. And on the other Hand, All that the Legions of Devils could do against us were, in comparison of falling into the Hands of the
<PB N="49" REF="004390_0054_100D4E4AB283D2E0"/>living GOD, less than the trouble of a few Mos∣chetto's, to being cast into a Den of hungry Lions: However, to think of sitting down with <HI>Abraham, &amp;c.</HI> in the Kingdom of God is a com∣fortable Thought, to his natural or spiritual Chil∣dren; and to be separated from godly Friends and Neighbours, and for ever excluded the Place of their eternal Abode, will be tormenting. Ah! to left up their Eyes being in Torment and see so many Thousands of all Nations, Kindreds, People and Tongues, standing before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with Robes, made White in his Blood, with Palms in their Hands, Crowns on their Heads, and fulness of Joy in their Hearts; serving God Day and Night (where indeed there is no Night) in his Temple, where he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them; and the Lamb, who is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and lead them to living Fountains of Water; where God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; this Sight of the Eye will affect and afflict, pierce and rend the Hearts of the Damned; especially such as perish from under the Gospel: For, Consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. They were not only as capable of enjoying &amp;c but all this was offered to them, as well and as much as unto them who accepted the Offer; Mark. 16.15, 16. <HI>Go Preach the Gospel, to every Creature: He that believeth and is baptized shall be Saved.</HI> Heb. 4.2. <HI>For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them; but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</HI> Luk. 14.16, 17. <HI>A certain Man made a great Supper, and bade many;
<PB N="50" REF="004390_0055_100D4E18221DE300"/>and sent his Servants at Supper time to say unto them who were bidden, Come, for all things are ready.</HI> Isa. 55.1, 2. <HI>Ho, every one that thirst∣eth, come to the Waters; and he that hath no Mo∣ney, come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money and without Price.</HI> Joh. 7.37. <HI>In the last Day, that great Day of the Feast, Jesus stood and cried, say∣ing, If any Man Thirst, let him come to me and Drink.</HI> Joh. 6.37. <HI>Him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Rev. 3.20. <HI>Behold, I stand at the Door and knock; if any Man hear my Voice and open the Door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</HI></P>
<P>To set down all the Offers and Tenders of Grace and Mercy, that God is freely making to all Sorts of Sinners under the Gospel (one only ex∣cepted) would be to transcribe a great Part of the Bible: That most liberal Offer, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17. deserves a peculiar Remark; <HI>And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come: And let him that heareth, say, Come: And let him that is athirst, come: and whosoever</HI> WILL, <HI>let him take the Water of Life freely.</HI> In this, almost the last and sweetest In∣vitation in the holy Book, we may observe several Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>[1.] The Thing offered is Grace and Glory: The Water of Life is used in both Senses, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.10 <HI>Rev.</HI> 7.17. And they are inseparably linked together, <HI>Psal.</HI> 84.11. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. All that God effectually calls by his Grace, he will bring infallibly to Glory.</ITEM>
<ITEM>[2] This Offer is made to all that hear the Gospel, without Exception: 'Tis not made to young Sinners in their Prime, excluding the an∣cient
<PB N="51" REF="004390_0056_100D4E4C42901CD8"/>and gray-headed: not to the Wise and Learned, excluding the Weak and Ignorant; nor to the well educated Children of godly Pa∣rents, who are outwardly Sober and Honest, ex∣cluding the Profane and abominably Wicked: Not only to such as have never yet quenched the Spirit; but to them also who have always resisted the Holy Ghost: (Forty Years long was I grieved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Not to these and those only; but to one and all universally: <HI>Whosoever will let him come.</HI> And then;</ITEM>
<ITEM>[3.] The Condition is only a willingness to accept the Offer; <HI>Whosoever will;</HI> which is not an antecedent willingness to our actual coming; as if none were concerned in this Offer, but such as the Tenders of Grace do find ready bent to accept of Life; but the Offer is made to such as have a Will not to come to Christ for Life: Life is set and held before our Eyes; and if, at any time, we like the free offer of Grace and Glory, on no other Condition but our acceptance, tis freely ours; if we desire to have it without buying, we may have it for asking; yea, we may have it for taking. When Christ says, <HI>If any Man thirst; let him come,</HI> Joh. 7.37. The slothful, or desponding Sinner says within him∣self, That is not for me; for I do not Thirst: but this Clause added to the former in the text under Consideration, <HI>Let him that is athirst come; and who soever will let him take the Water of Lise freely,</HI> leaves the Unbeliever speechless: for what will the Sinner say, I am not willing to be con∣verted and saved, made holy and happy, in God's Way? What Pity then can you expect, while you thus wilfully perish?</ITEM>

<P><PB N="52" REF="004390_0057_100D4E19B7325F00"/>
As if a Malefactor at the Foot of the Ladder, should refuse such an offer as this from the Mouth, or under the Hand and Seal of his gracious Prince and Judge; Condemned and hopeless Rebel! If thou wilt fall down on thy Knees and accept this free and full Pardon, thy Sentence is revoked, thy Treason forgiven, and thy Estate and Honour with thy Life shall be restored; nor must this Clause of necessity come in, if thou canst give Security for thy good Behaviour and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Loyalty: For Christ says, If you are but willing to take me for your Lord and King as well as Priest and Prophet, I will give you a loyal Heart; I shall stand bound for your good Behaviour, Jer. 32.40. <HI>I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, that I will not turn away from you to do you Good; but I will put my Fear into their Hearts, that they shall not depart from me. Of them that thou gavest me, have I lost none,</HI> Joh. 18.9.</P>
<P>Gospel Sinners in Hell do know to their Cost, even to Killing Vexation and raging Madness with themselves, that what I have now laid down from the Scripture is true; and that they are Damned for ever because they were not willing to be eternally Happy; and purged and sanctified in order there unto: Jer. 13.27. <HI>O Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clean? When shalt it once he?</HI> Luk. 13.34. <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that were sent unto thee: how often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen doth gather her brood under her Wings; and ye would not?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ohject.</HI> But will it be no extenuation of their eternal Vexation (the fruit of their wilful Folly)
<PB N="53" REF="004390_0058_100D4E4E721DF4C0"/>for the Damned to remember that they have read and heard such Texis as these, Joh. 6.37.44. <HI>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me. No Man can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him.</HI> So, ver. 64, 65. <HI>Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. And be said, there∣fore said I unto you, that no Man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</HI> Act. 13.48. <HI>As many as were ordained to eternal Life believed.</HI> Joh. 10.26. <HI>Ye believe not, because ye are not of my Sheep.</HI> Rom. 11.7. <HI>The Election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</HI> Infer∣ring from these, and such like Scriptures, that because God never exerted his Almighty Power, to draw them to Christ, it was impossible they should, by any Power of their own believe unto the saving of their Souls, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19, 20. And because they were not of the Number given to Jesus Christ, therefore (may they say) Christ had no Warrant to save them; Joh. 17.2. <HI>As thou hast given him Power over all Flesh, that he should give eternal Life to as many as thou hast given him.</HI> Joh. 12.39.40 <HI>Therefore they could not be∣live, because that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their Eyes, &amp; hardned their Hearts, that they should not see with their Eyes, nor understand with their Heart, and be converted, and 1 should heal them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Such Thoughts as these will afford them no relief at all: As it did not excuse their Sin in not believing, so it will not extenuate their Punish∣ment. This will be evident if we consider a few things.</P>

<PB N="54" REF="004390_0059_100D4E1BE91CBC08"/>
<ITEM>(1.) That the Heathen, who never had any Gospel Offers, are left without Excuse; Rom. 1.18,—<HI>For the Wrath of God is revealed from Hea∣ven, against all ungod<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unrighteousness of Men, who hold the Truth in Unrighteousness: Be∣cause that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them: For the invisible Things of him from the creation of the World, are clearly seen, being understood by the Things that are made; even his eternal Power and God-head; so that they are without excuse: because that when they knew God, they glorified him not, &amp;c.</HI> Their not knowing God-Man, the Mediator, (who was the Hope of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Saviour thereof) did no ways excuse them for their (so vilely) dishonouring God the Creator, <HI>ver.</HI> 22, 23.

Now if they concerning whom it is said, how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard, are yet without excuse; and must bear the Wrath of God for ever, because they did not the Good they knew, and did Evil against the Light of Nature; how speechless then will <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Sinners be; such as have lived in <HI>Chorazin</HI> and <HI>Bethsaida;</HI> and with <HI>Capernaum,</HI> have been lifted up to Heaven?

<P><PB N="55" REF="004390_0060_100D4E512732F920"/>
But,</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) We find no relief in like Cases, of a tem∣poral Nature, by this way of arguing. As now, Suppose a Man should first drown his Conscience and Reason in Strong Liquor; and then, coming home at midnight, should in his drunken Fit, set Fire to his House, where his Wife and Children are in Bed and asleep, and burn them all alive; would it afford such a mad Fool any relief, when laid in Irons, or bound to the Stake, to think that he had only done (as'tis said of <HI>Herod,</HI> and <HI>Pontius Pilate;</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI>) what God's Hand and Counsel determined before to be done, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.27, 28. Or, Suppose a Num∣ber of Men to run themselves deeply in Debt, and having nothing to pay, they are to be fold for Slaves; but before the Time comes for their being Shipp'd off, the Creditor has compassion on them, and sends to the Prison, a faithful Servant or beloved Son, to make them all this gracious offer, That if they will own the Debt, and but say they would gladly discharge it if they were able, his Father or Master will frankly for give all that they owe, and give it under his Hand and Seal for present Security, till, in a short Time, they shall not only be delivered out of Prison, but put in a sure way to live at Ease and to the Full, in Wealth and Honour, more than Heart could wish: Now, if one and ano∣ther should thankfully embrace the offer; but the biggest Part are of another Mind; they either deny or lessen the Debt, discredit or slight this good News; and even scorn to be beholding to the Compassionate Creditor; till his abused
<PB N="56" REF="004390_0061_100D4E1E9501A3C8"/>Clemency turn into pitiless Fury; the Proud ungrateful Debtors are sold, that Payment may be made: How would it vex them, now, in the House of Bondage to consider, how faitly they were offered, and how foolishly they refused offered Mercy; notwithstanding the Decrees of God are every whit as much concerned in deter∣mining, and his Providence in bringing about all these temporal Thing, which concern the Chil∣dren of Men in this World, as in Things relating to our Souls, and the future, everlasting State: And if Men have no relief here in temporal Dis∣tresses, and bodily Miseries, which they wilfully bring upon themselves, by their own foolish mad∣ness, from the consideration of God's unalterable Decrees; how should the Damned then mitigate their Sorrows by any such Reflections? It can never be; as will further appear if we consider,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) That the Decrees of God do not force Men to Sin; nor by any forcible restraint keep them back from their Duty. Hence'tis said in the forementioned Case of our Lord's Crucifixion, Act. 2.23. <HI>Him being delivered, by the determinate Counsel and Fore-Knowledge of God, ye have taken, and with wicked Hands have crucified the Lord of Life and Glory</HI> They put Christ to Death just according to the Purpose of him who worketh all Things after the counsel of his own Will; and exactly according to the Scriptures, that could not be broken; yet they did it with wicked Hands. And even <HI>Judas,</HI> the most wicked of them all (Joh. 19.11. <HI>He that delivered me to thee hath the greater Sin</HI>) that were conerned in Christ's Death, does fulfil the Scripture and God's
<PB N="57" REF="004390_0062_100D4E52AF2F5C68"/>Decree, Act. 11.16. <HI>Men and Brethren; This Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the holy Ghost, by the Mouth of David, spake before, concerning Judas, which was Guide to them that took Jesus;</HI> compared with <HI>Act.</HI> 4.27, 28. Yet, if you consider the Account that the same Spirit of Truth gives of the Matter, by <HI>Matthew,</HI> in Chap. 26.14, 15, 16. <HI>Then one of the Twelve, cal∣led</HI> Judas Iscariot, <HI>went unto the chief Priests, and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they convenanted with him for thirty Peices of Silver; and from that time be sought Opportunity to betray him.</HI> Behold, and see if there be any force put on <HI>Judas,</HI> by the Decree of God! Behold, how voluntary and deliberate he is in this cursed Action! He was not sent for, but <HI>went to the high Priests:</HI> They put him not at all upon the hellish Treason, before he begs the Office of a Traitor; <HI>What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you?</HI> And having made his self-undoing Bargain, 'tis said, <HI>he sought Opportunity to betray him.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Neither do the Decrees of God, his determinate Counsel and Fore-knowledge hinder any Man from doing his Duty; Jer. 7.27. <HI>Thoushalt speak, &amp;c. but they will not hearken unto thee,</HI> And why? <HI>Be∣cause they walk in the Counsel and Imagination of their own evil Heart:</HI> As ver. 24. So Ezek. 34, — <HI>Son of Man, Go, get thee to the House of</HI> Israel; <HI>and speak, with my Words unto them. But the House of</HI> Israel <HI>will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me:</HI> (And why) <HI>Be∣cause all the House of</HI> Israel <HI>are Impudent and hard hearted,</HI> ver. 7. God indeed knows that many
<PB N="58" REF="004390_0063_100D4E20C534AFF8"/>will die in their Sins, for want of Faith in Christ; but he knows also that it is not so much because they <HI>cannot</HI> believe, as because they <HI>will not</HI> come to Christ that they might have Life. How evident then is it to all, but such as wilfully shut their own Eyes, how little relief it can be to the Damned for them to think in the Flames of <HI>To∣phet,</HI> That God did from all Eternity Decree to leave them to their own Choice; and then to punish them for their wilful Unbelief and Im∣penitency.</P>
<P>Thus much for the first Confideration, <HI>viz.</HI> That Gospel, Impenitent Sinners, not only have a Capacity of being Happy; but Grace and Glory were freely offered them, as well and as much as to others; but they wilfully rejected the Offer; yea tho' they were frequently and earnest∣ly intreated to accept the same; and had all manner of Arguments used with them, to per∣swade them to turn and live: which may be distincty considered, as another Evidence of the doctrinal Truth, now under Consideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Damned in Hell shall have their Hell-Fire inflamed and inraged, while they will for ever remember, how perfectly Happy the glorifi∣ed Saints are, in accepting those very Offers they themselves refused; yea after very frequent and most importunate Intreaties that they would ac∣cept of Life and Immortality, brought to Light by the Gospel. It will ever be fresh in their Minds, how the Ambassadors of Christ have pleaded with them: begging, as if it had been a Starving Beggar, pleading for an Alms; or a condemned Man, begging for his Life, that they
<PB N="59" REF="004390_0064_100D4E54673E8240"/>would think on their Ways; consider their lat∣ter End; prize and improve all Seasons of Grace; seek the Lord, in Season and in Earnest; Make much of Time, even the Minutes of pre∣cious, fleeting Time; giving all Diligence to make their Calling and Election sure; working out their own Salvation, with Fear and Tremb∣ling; striving to enter in at the strait Gate; and taking the Kingdom of Heaven by Force; 2 Cor. 5.20. <HI>Now then, we are Ambassadors for Christ; a though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's Stead be ye reconciled to God.</HI></P>
<P>They will remember how often such Scrip∣tures as these were repeated in their Ears; O that my People were Wise, that they understood this; that they would consider their latter End. Wilt thou not be made clean; when shall it once be? Be instructed, O <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> lest my Soul depart from thee, How shall I give thee up, <HI>Ephraim?</HI> How shall I deliver thee, <HI>Judah?</HI> Turn ye, Turn ye; why will ye die, O House of <HI>Israel?</HI> As I Live, saith the Lord, I have no Pleasure in the Death of him that dieth: Turn you therefore from all your evil Ways; so Ini∣quity shall not be your Ruin. Wash you; make you clean; put away the Evil of your Doings, from before mine Eyes; cease to do Evil; learn to do Well: Come now, let us reason together saith the Lord: Though your Sins are as Scar∣let, they shall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool. Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near: Let the Wicked forsake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his
<PB N="60" REF="004390_0065_100D4E2272008D68"/>Tho'ts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon: For my Tho'ts are not your Tho'ts, neither are your Ways my Ways, saith the Lord: For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, so are my Ways higher than your Ways, &amp; my Tho'ts than your Tho'ts. Ask and ye shall receive; Seek and ye shall find; Knock and it shall be opened unto you. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am Meek and lowly in Heart; and ye shall find Rest to your Souls: For my Yoke is easy, and my Burden is light. O do not that abominable Thing which my Soul hates, saith the Lord.</P>
<P>These and a thousand more like Passages, which they have read and heard in Time, will a million million Times over pass through their thoughtful Minds in Hell: And they will be forced to call to Mind all the strong Reasons and powerful Ar∣guments that Christ's Ministers have used with them; if possible to have gained their Consent to their own eternal Happiness, on Gospel Terms; and to have kept them back from this Place of Torment. How they have been warned with many compassionate Tears of Grief and Love, to flie from the Wrath to come; and pleaded with by all the Regards they owed to the creating Mercy &amp; redeeming Love; God's Glory, and their own Safety &amp; Comfort; present Peace and everlasting Rest: arguing from the necessi∣ty and utility of a found Conversion and Gospel Conversation; &amp; from the incomparable, super∣lative
<PB N="61" REF="004390_0066_100D4E567212D130"/>Delights of Communion with God: en∣treating them to have some pity on their poor, perishing Souls; and not to destroy themselves, and sell eternal Joys for an empty Song, a Blad∣der full of Wind, a dry Leaf, a momentany Bubble, Vapour and Smoke, the Dream of a Shadow, less than nothing, and Vanity of Va∣nities: (Such is all sinful Delight.)</P>
<P>It will be impossible for the Prisoners of eter∣nal Darkness, who once had the Light, to forget how they were told of this bottomless Pit and burning Lake, to fright them from Sin; and how the Glory of Heaven was displayed, to allure them to Christ. All that ever they heard or read, con∣cerning his transcendent Beauty, and unsearcha∣ble Riches; what he had done for them, would be to them, and bring them to, if they would but have given the Consent of their Hearts to an Espousal with the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, the Heir of all Things. Moreover, all Counsels and Directions how they should seek God so as to find him; and infallibly secure an Interest in Christ; that were plainly laid down before them, in publick or private; but they had no Heart to any Thing but Sin; they could find no leasure to think on these Things in Time; and now they can't but vex their Souls to Death with the Thoughts of them to Eternity.</P>
<P N="3">3. Gospel Sinners, in the Place of Torment, will remember what variety of Means God used with them, in their life Time, as well as with others that are saved: Not only by his written Word, (unfolded, applied and enforced, in many excellent Books put into their Hands) and the
<PB N="62" REF="004390_0067_100D4E24C33C3770"/>publick Ministry; (Either in a more stated Course, or Sermons that they have occasionally heard, from one Minister and another, both a∣broad and at home) but by Mercies and Af∣flictions also, has the Lord been seeking to reclaim and reform them, Isa. 1.2 <HI>Hear, O Heavens, and give Ear, O Earth, for the Lord hath spoken; I have nourished and brought up Chilaren, and they have rebesled against me.</HI> Jer 5.23, 24 <HI>But this People hath a revolting and rebellious Heart, they are revolted and gine: Neither say they in their Heart, let us now fear the Lord our God, who giveth Rain; both the former and the latter, in his Season: He reserveth unto us the appointed Weeks of the Harvest.</HI> Did they not know how they ought to have feared the Lord and his Goodness; of which not only the Earth was full; but God filled their Hearts with Food and Gladness: Their Life, and Health, and Limbs were precious in God's Sight: Their Houses he filled with all good Things: Their Fields and Flocks he made fruitful; and often spake to them in their Prosperity; drawing them with the Cords of a Man, with the Bands of Love: Rem. 12.1. <HI>I beseech you therefore Brethren, by the Mer∣cies of God, that you present your Bodies a living Pacrifice, holy, acceptable to God; which is your reasonable Service:</HI> but they would not hear: Thus they despised the Riches of divine Good∣ness, Forbearance and Long suffering, so kindly taking them by the Hand, to lead them to Re∣pentance; while the Sun-Beams of Love and Bounty, instead of melting, did harden their im∣penitent Hearts: and now they must pay for all in Hell I indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and
<PB N="63" REF="004390_0068_100D4E5907FFA738"/>Anguish, are but the Treasures that they had been hoarding up, all their Life long, against this Day of Wrath. If these ungrateful Wretches had never heard the Gospel; yet common-Mercy, thus shamefully abused, would have been an authentick Witness for God, against the Sinner: Act 14.17. <HI>Nevertheless, be left not him∣self without Witness, in that he did Good, and gave us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seasons, silling our Hearis with Food and Gladness.</HI></P>
<P>And then every worldly Cross and Trouble in the Flesh; all Vexations and Afflictions, where∣by an Hedge of Thorns was made in all their sinful Ways; which yet their insatiable Lusts, and Head strong Passions brake through; will come in as so many Items against them: And because the Lord thus purged them, and they were not purged: but in their Affliction tres∣passed yet more against the Lord, therefore his Fury shall rest on them for ever! They would neither hearken to the Voice of his Word nor Rod, Ministers, Parents, godly Neighbours, Death of Friends, narrow Escapes, recovery from Sickness, deliverance out of Captivity: and a thousand thousand more of particu∣lar Intimations concerning their Duty &amp; Interest; Warnings of their Sin and Danger, will dwell in their Thoughts, and fret their galled Consciences in Hell, World without End! Especially while they consider, how that Thousands of glorified Saints, never had such a great variety of long continued Means and Methods used with them, as themselves have had, <HI>Ezek</HI> 24.13. This is the third Aggravation of the Gospel Sinner's Dam∣nation.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="64" REF="004390_0069_100D4E26D3CAC9A8"/>
4. They will also remember, as what variety of Means the Lord used with them, so how, by his good Spirit, he was wont to strive with them in and by the Means of Grace. How they were convinced of this and that Sin, together with the Evil and Danger of it: The Spirit of God has stood in their way of Disobedience, either with the drawn Sword of some dreadful Threatning, or else with jealous Indignation, mixed with lov∣ing Compassion, beseeching the tempted Soul to forbear its darling Lust, Jer. 44.4. <HI>O do not this abominable Thing that I hate.</HI> Convicted also they have been of their neglect of that and the other Duty, which they ought to have attended and performed: And when the Wrath of God, revealed from Heaven, shall be poured out upon them, for their profaning or not calling on the Name of the Lord; then they will remember how they stifled Convictions, and held the Truth in Unrighteousness, <HI>Jer</HI> 10.25. <HI>Rom</HI> 1.18. And Oh! they will never, never forget, how the good Spirit of God has taken them by the Hand, and led them into a Corner, to confess and bewail their Sins; to cry and lament after the Lord; but they have soon quenched all these good Mo∣tions, and turned again to Folly; hardned their Hearts still more and more, through the deceit∣fulness of Sin; and then more obstinately resist∣ing the Holy Ghost, till there was no Remedy. <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36.16. Or else delaying to put their good Purposes in Execution till Death and Darkness made it too late, Joh. 9.4. <HI>The Night cometh wherein no Man can Work:</HI> And now they find and feel Blackness of Darkness,
<PB N="65" REF="004390_0070_100D4E5B19BCA368"/>reserved for them for ever; because while they had the Light (not only of Scripture Revelation, but of spiritual Illumination, and Conviction) they walked not in the Light, but despised and rebelled against it, Prov. 1.23,— <HI>Turn you at my Reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spirit, &amp;c. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretch∣ed out my Hand, and no Man regarded: But ye have set at nought all my Counsel, and would none of my Reproof; I also will laugh at your Calamity, and mick when your Fear cometh: When your Fear cometh as Desolation, and your Destruction as a Whirlwind: When Distress &amp; Angussh cometh upon you.</HI> Oh! This is a fearful Aggravation of Sin and Punishment, that they should (not only shut their Ears against the Word, but (<HI>make their Heart as an Adamant, lest they should bear the Law; and the Words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his Spirit,</HI> Zech. 7.12. <HI>Therefore</HI> (as it follows there) <HI>came great Wrath from the Lord.</HI> Nothing can more incense the burning Wrath of God, than for Men to kick against his tender Bowels of Compassion and Pity. Oh! To have his loving Kindness abused; this goes to the Heart of God! Yea, it was this that alienated the Heart of God from his Covenant People of old; whom he sometimes calls the dearly beloved of his Soul. Isai. 63.7,— <HI>I will mention the Loving Kindnesses of the Lord, and the Praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and the great Goodness towards the House of</HI> Israel, <HI>which he hath bestowed on them, according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving Kind∣nesses: For he said, Surely they are my People, Chil∣dren
<PB N="66" REF="004390_0071_100D4E285D243098"/>that will not Lie; so be was their Saviour. In all their Afflictions he was afflicted, and the An∣gel of his Presence saved them: In his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the Days of old: But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their Enemy, and fought against them.</HI> And be sure, whatever the Lord mentions in his Word, as an Aggravation of the Gospel Sinner's inexcu∣sable Transgression and Disobedience here, shall come into his Mind, as an Aggravation of the just Recompence of his intolerable Reward here∣after.</P>
<P>But here lies the Force of the Argument, we are upon; That as those who die in their Un∣belief, had the same precious Means of Grace, that, in the Almighty Spirit's Hand, proved ef∣fectual to the Salvation of others; so they had the same blessed Spirit of Grace to strive with them; but their Neck being as an Iron Sinew, and their Brow Brass, they did wickedly and wilfully oppose him. Act. 7.51. <HI>Ye stiff necked, and uncircumcised in Heart and Ears; ye do always resist the Holy Ghost</HI> And hence, what bitter weeping, doleful wailing, and outragous gnash∣ing of Teeth will there be, among you Christ-despising Sinners, when you shall see your Friends and Neighbours, of the same Town &amp; Church, in the Kingdom of God, and you your selves thrust out; for neglecting the same Means of Grace, rejecting the same Offers of Grace, and for re∣sisting the same Spirit of Grace, that they wise∣ly improved, thankfully accepted, and did not always resist; but sooner or later, cherish and comply with.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="004390_0072_100D4E5D0D4965D0"/>
Object. <HI>It's true, we do always resst the Holy Ghost; and always shall, unless Omnipotency take away this Resistance and Enmity?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Supposing the objector to be convinced of Sin, and in some Measure humbled out of Self; a more tender Answer must be given here, than to the blasphemous Quareller, under the first <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">(1) It's true, that the corrupt Hearts of Men do as naturally oppose and resist the Spirit of Grace, when he comes to convince of Sin and Righteousness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Water does quench Fire. Those that are now converted Saints upon Earth, and such as are glorified Saints in Heaven, did once resist, even as others, for a Time, yea, al∣ways did they continue resisting the Holy Ghost, till irresistible Power &amp; Grace did take away this natural Resistance, and slay this rooted Enmity of their carnal Minds against God and Christ. And even still, in the Hearts of True Converts, who have Flesh as well as Spirit, there is too much Resistance remaining. 'Tis to such as are sancti∣fied, as well as others, that the Apostle speaks, when he says, 1 Thes. 5.19. <HI>Quench not the Spi∣rit.</HI> Yet, this cursed Enmity of our Hearts a∣gainst God, is altogether unreasonable &amp; inex∣cusable: We must not plead for it; nor by any Means seek to excuse our not submitting to God, by our Enmity against Him. This would be, as if a Traitor should plead his Hatred of his gra∣cious Prince, as an Excuse for his Treason and Rebellion! Joh. 15.25. <HI>They hated me</HI> (says Christ) <HI>without a Cause.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="68" REF="004390_0073_100D4E2A74BD1558"/>
(2) It's both a great Mercy and good Sign, (at least of our being in a hopeful Way for a well grounded Peace) thus far to be convinced of Sin. When we come to know the Plague of our own Hearts, and come to see the need we have of an all-wise and omnipotent Physician, this is a good Step. We have been tampering, and trying many Ways to heal our selves; and sometimes the Wound has seem'd to be skin'd over; but it breaks out again: Prayers &amp; Tears, Reformation and Resolution won't do; we utterly despair of Relief in this Old Covenant, Self-righteous Way: And now, if it please God also to humble us at his Foot, under a Sense of our utter Unworthiness that ever soveraign Grace should lend an helping Hand, or so much as cast an Eye of Pity towards us, the preparatory Work is then wrought: The Self-condemned Sinner has nothing else to do, but to believe in him, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption.</P>
<P>It's true, Faith also is the Gift of God; and the Effect of his Power; even the exceeding Greatness of his mighty Power, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19. But when the convinced Sinner is once brought to yield himself up into the Hands of divine So∣vereignty; to be disposed of at God's own, meet good Will &amp; Pleasure; then the Work of Con∣version is as good as wrought: never did any such Soul miscarry. Jam. 4.6, 7 <HI>God resisteth the Proud; but giveth Grace to the Humble: Sub∣mit your selves therefore to God. Humble your selves in his Sight, and he shall lift you up,</HI> ver. 10.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="69" REF="004390_0074_100D4E5F2A3845F8"/>
(3.) Although sinful, apostate Man can't over∣come this contrariety of his Heart to the holy Nature and Will of God, nor of himself cease to oppose him, when he comes by his Spirit to destroy natural &amp; righteous Self; and to create the Man a new in Christ Jesus to good Works; yet the poor Rebel has Power to cry unto Him that is able to subdue all Things to himself, that he would be pleased, for his own Name's sake, to pull down all the strong Holds of proud Self-love, carnal Reason, and worldly Wisdom: Casting down Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth it self against the Knowlege of God; and bringing into Captivity every Thought, to the Obedience of Christ, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.4.5.</P>
<P>In short, This is the important Case thou want∣est to be resolved in; <HI>What shall I do that I may wark the Works of God?</HI> Take the Resolution thereof in Christ's own Words, Joh. 6.29. <HI>This is the Work of God, that ye believe in Him whom he hath sent.</HI> Christ is the Author of eternal Salvation to all, and only to such as thus obey him. This Obedience of Faith is a Fruit of the Spirit, now striving with thee: But, <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive with Man,</HI> (saith the Lord, Gen. 6.3) If you continue to rebel, and vex the Holy Spirit there will be no Remedy: And in Hell thou wilt remember how that Life and Death was set before thee; how thou wast in∣treated to chose Life; how the Matter was urg∣ed upon thee, by the ministry of the Word, and Motions of the Spirit: And will not this be a fearful Aggravation of thy eternal Misery, to
<PB N="70" REF="004390_0075_100D4E2D2B993588"/>think, how that by quenching the Spirit, thou hast kindled a Fire in God's Anger, that burns to the lowest Hell; where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched?</P>
<P N="5">5. Such as perish from under the Gospel, shall find themselves lost and damned for ever, not because they had sinned; but because they did not repent of their Sins: not so much for that they had broken the Law of God, as for their rejecting the Offers of Grace by Jesus Christ. 'Tis true, they were conceived and born under a twofold Guilt, and so doubly cursed by the just Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, and a depraved Na∣ture, the necessary consequent: But thus the whole Race of <HI>Adam</HI> died in him; and these as well as others should have been made alive in Christ, had they come unto him; or be willing that he should come into them. Joh. 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have Life.</HI> Rev. 3.20 <HI>Behold, I stand at the Door, and knock: If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</HI> Their Childhood and Youth was Vanity: Many also of those who are saved, forgot their Crea∣tor in the Days of their Youth: But they re∣membred their Redeemer before it was too late, which these never did; and this neglect prov'd their Ruin.</P>
<P>In short, Gospel Sinners, lifting up their Eves in Torment, will see, not only <HI>Abraham. Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> but <HI>Manasseh, Magdalen</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Kingdom of God, and themselves thrust out; not because they had been greater Sinners, but because they were impenitent Unbelievers: and
<PB N="71" REF="004390_0076_100D4E628FFF3AE8"/>how will it tear the damned Wretch in Pieces, to consider that his Companions in Sin, yea, some of the Ringleaders in Sin, did consider and turn from all their Abominations, and were washed and made white in the Blood of the Lamb; which was every way sufficient to have cleansed him also from all his Sin, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.7. Here's the Extremity of Folly, and Heighth of Mad∣ness! To follow a Multitude in sinning, but never to follow any in repenting and believing: Mat. 21.31, 32 <HI>Jesus saith unto them, Verily, I say unto you, that the Publicans and Harlots go in∣to the Kingdom of God before you. For</HI> John <HI>came unto you in the way of Righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the Publicans and the Harlots believ∣ed him. And ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterwards that ye might believe.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. From all the fore-going Particulars laid to∣gether, it follows, That when the Gospel Sinner comes to the Place of Torment, he shall plainly see, that his Destruction is of himself: Hos. 13.9. O <HI>Israel, Thou hast destroyed thy self.</HI> Life and Death have been set before them; they have their own Choice. Deut. 30.15, &amp; 19. <HI>I call Heaven and Earth to Record this Day against you, that I have set before you Life and Death; Blessing and Cursing.</HI> They had what best liked them; Carnal Delights while they lived, and Hell Tor∣ment afterwards; rather than godly Sorrow with eternal Joy. 2 Tim. 3.4. <HI>Lovers of Pleasures more than Lovers of God.</HI> Luk. 6.21, 25. <HI>Blessed are ye that Weep now, for ye shall Laugh: Wo unto you that Laugh now, for ye shall Mourn and Weep.</HI> They loved the mortal Poison of Sin (because it
<PB N="72" REF="004390_0077_100D4E2F542DD138"/>was sweet in the Mouth, <HI>Job</HI> 20.12. and therefore loved Death (in it's Seed;) yea, (which is worse) they hated the Prince of Life; even JESUS, who would have delivered them from the Wrath now come upon them. Prov. 8.36 <HI>He that sinneth against me, wrongeth his own Soul: all they that bate me, love Death.</HI> Alas! If damned Sinners could possibly be so deceived as to perswade themselves, that they were, by the irresistible Temptations of Sa∣tan, necessitated to commit Sin; or forcibly kept back from repenting and believing the Gospel, by God's unalterable Decree, Hell would be no Hell to them, in comparison of what the Guilt of Self and Soul-murther will make it. They shall know assuredly, That the very Reason why they miss'd of Christ, and Grace, and Heaven, was because they loved Sin, Self and the World better. Thus the Thing is in it self, and it will appear so to you, Gospel impenitent Sinners, when <HI>Enoch</HI>'s Prophesy shall be fulfilled, Jude ver. 14, 15, 16. <HI>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten Thousand of his Saints, to convince all that are Ungodly, of all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him. These are Murmurers, Complainers, walking after their own Lusts; and their Mouth speaketh great swelling Words. If I had not come, and spoken to them, they had not had Sin: but now they have no Cloke for their Sin,</HI> Joh. 15.22.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>How shall the Damned see it to be thro' their own Default that they perish, seeing they had no Power to believe unto the saving of their Souls. It was as possible for the Heathen to believe in him of whom they had not heard, as for these who had Preachers to believe, without the exceeding greatness
<PB N="73" REF="004390_0078_100D4E6457C76700"/>of the Almighty's Power, irresistibly enabling them: and not being chosen to Salvation by the Father, nor of Christ's Sheep, for whom he laid down his Life; the Spirit was not sent to sanctify them; and with∣out Faith and Holiness (which are both above their Power) it being impossible to please God here, or see him with Comfort hereafter: How is it the Repro∣bates own Fault, that he misses of Heaven?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This Objection, as to the Substance of it, has been answered before; and such as replied against God were silenced; or at least, had suffi∣cient Conviction offered, from the Word of God, to stop their Mouth: But I would now further satisfy some upright, but weak Christians, who are sometimes, by Satan's Temptations, the car∣nal Reasonings of the Truth's bitter Enemies, and their own remaining Enmity as well as Dark∣ness, stumbled and perplexed, not a little about this Matter.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">[1] It must be granted, that no Sinner can come to Christ for Salvation, till drawn by Al∣mighty Power, by all conquering Grace. Joh. 6.44, 65. <HI>No Man can come to me, except the Fa∣ther, which hath sent me, draw him. No Man can come to me, except it were given to him of my Fa∣ther.</HI> And it must also be acknowledged, that whatever Means God uses with them that were not chosen to Salvation, yet he does not secretly and irresistibly draw them to Christ, Rom. 11.7. <HI>The Election obtained it; the rest were blinded.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">[2] It is, nevertheless, the Reprobates own Fault that he goes on in Sin, rejecting Christ, till he die impenitently in Unbelief: For,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="74" REF="004390_0079_100D4E311F193E20"/>
(1.) He knew nothing but he might be elected. It is a Thing that can't be known in this World; unless to such as have committed the unpardon∣able Sin; or to others who know infallibly that such an one has blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, and done despite to the Spirit of Grace. The Elect are Children of Wrath by Nature, as well as others, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3. And the very same gracious Offers, and conditional Promises were made to the one and the other. Christ did not dissemble when he dropt those compassionate Tears on obstinate <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and weeping, said, <HI>How often would I have gathered thy Children to∣gether, as an Hen gathers her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not.</HI> If such as shall be rejected by Christ the Judge, had been willing to come to Jesus the Saviour; or but willing to open the Door and let him come into them, and had been denied any Part in him, meerly because they were not elected, it were then another Case; but they had no Mind to come to Christ for Justification; nor that he should come to sanctify them, <HI>Job.</HI> 5.40. <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.27. The Fault is there∣fore their own; and they are without Excuse.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Had they been perswaded that they were elected; yet, their blind, proud, and base Hearts would have opposed an holy JESUS, a crucifyed Saviour; and rejected him with Contempt. Many of the Jews called <HI>Abraham</HI> their Father; yea, they boasted that God was their Father; and doubted not but he had chosen them, and had set his Love upon them; yet could they not by any Means, no not by Miracles be perswaded to be∣lieve on Christ, <HI>Job.</HI> 8.39, 41, 47, 59, <HI>&amp;</HI> 9 13, <HI>to</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="004390_0080_100D4E66CB54AA50"/>34, <HI>&amp;</HI> 10.42 <HI>to</HI> 53. <HI>&amp;</HI> 12 37. So that it was no conceived impossibility of believing, because they were not elected, that hindred these from coming to Christ; but their Ignorance of him, and En∣mity against him; for which they must blame themselves, because they rejected Knowledge, and cherished their malicious Envy: And both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are alike in this; they both conspired to crucify their common Saviour, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.25, 26, 27. And both continue to oppose his Doctrine, 1 Cor. 1.23. <HI>We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling Block, and to the Grecks foolishness.</HI> And even they that are saved, before their effectual Calling, have still Hearts as wick∣ed as were the elect <HI>Israelites</HI> Hands, who were converted by <HI>Peter</HI>'s Sermon, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.22,—So that as, neither Election it self, nor the Know∣ledge of it (if we could be sure of it before our Calling) is sufficient to draw us to Christ; so, neither can Reprobates plead their Non-Election, as any Excuse for their not believing; as well on these two Accounts already mentioned, as in some other Respects, that may be added.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Many of them that perish, are such as al∣ways denied and hated the Doctrine of personal Election from Eternity; and were for the Doctrine of Free-Will, as it stands in opposition to that of Free-Grace; holding that God desires the Salva∣tion of all that have the Gospel alike; that Christ died for them all, one as much as another; and that the Spirit strives no less with such as finally resist him, than with them that comply with his Motions, so as to Repent and Believe the Gos∣pel. That some of my Hearers are (or at least
<PB N="76" REF="004390_0081_100D4E32EC5C79D0"/>have been) of this Perswasion, I must believe, be∣cause they have plainly told me as much; and their uneasiness, discovered in Words &amp; Actions, when the contrary Doctrines are asserted, is a further Demonstration of it.</P>
<P>It is not now my Business so much to confute the erroneous, as to satisfy the Weak, how the Doctrine of Election, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which passes by the greatest Part, even of such as live under the Gospel) can stand with their perishing thro' their own Default: And I have gained one Point further towards their Satisfaction, when they shall see, how that such as are for universal Redemp∣tion, and profess to believe that God has given to them (and all) Power sufficient, in the use of Means, to obtain Salvation; if yet they miss of their Expectation, and be found Enemies to Christ at last, they must needs be speechless, and bear the Blame of their Self-Destruction for ever. For what can they say, when the final Sentence is passed, why it should not be executed upon them? Why did they not turn and live; since they boasted of a Power to do it? Or rather, Why did they not acknowledge they had none, and go to Christ for it, who never rejected any that, lamenting their Ignorance, Impotence, En∣mity and utter Unworthiness, came a begging to him for Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) It is true, such as perish were not given to Christ to be redeemed and saved; and so, not irresistibly drawn to him. Joh. 6.37. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me.</HI> But who, and what was it that drave them away from
<PB N="77" REF="004390_0082_100D4E6973400E60"/>Christ? Was it not their causeless Hatred of him? <HI>Job.</HI> 15.25. And what was it that drew them the quite contrary Way? Was it not their love to Sin, Self and the World? <HI>Mat</HI> 22.5, 6. <HI>Luke</HI> 14.16, <HI>to</HI> 20. 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 3.4. And what will they say for themselves, when Christ shall ask them another Day, Why they did not come to him at the call of the Gospel? Why, if they speak the Truth, they must needs say, We did not Love thee: We saw no Form nor Comeli∣ness in thee, why we should desire thee. It is true, we heard, by the Report of the Gospel, that thou wer't fairer than the Children of Men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 45.2. yea, altogether lovely, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.16. But we could not think it was true. Isai. 53.1, 2, 3 <HI>Who hath believed our Report? — He hath no Form nor Comeliness: and when we shall see him, there is no Beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of Men; — We hid, as it were our Faces from him; He was despised, and we esteemed him not.</HI> Why did they hate God and Christ? Was it because they were not loved by God, and chosen in Christ, before the Foun∣dation of the World? No; for the Elect hated the Lord before Conversion. Was it because most of them had never seen Christ? No; Joh. 15.24. <HI>But now, have they both seen and hated, both me and my Father.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.8. <HI>Whom hav∣ing not seen, ye love.</HI> Had they any Reason to hate one that bled and died for his Enemies, and mourned and wept over such as were implacably so? No; Joh. 15.25. <HI>They hated me without a Cause.</HI> And now, judge I pray you, betwixt Christ, and such as despised, rejected and hated
<PB N="78" REF="004390_0083_100D4E349D192860"/>him; and preferred every Trifle, yea, their cussed Lusts, that were Soul Murderers, before him; whither they are not justly condemned for loving the World as their God, and hating Christ worse than they did the Devil; or Sin, which is the only Thing that makes the Devil hateful: Such then as love Sin more than Christ, can't be said to hate him less than they do the Devil. Sure none will pity them, or plead for them in that Day, when they see what a CHRIST it was that they hated, and what hatred it was they bare him; and for what, even the holy Image of his Father, and that too it may be under a fair outside shew of Love to him. Luk. 22.47,—<HI>Judas, one of the Twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Je∣sus to kiss him.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5) What, though Sinners have no Power to Repent and Believe the Gospel, with such a Faith as works by Love; yet they that perish are without Excuse, in that it was not only through Man's wilful Apostacy from God, that he came to need a Saviour (Eccl. 7.29. <HI>God made Man upright: but he hath sought out many Inventions</HI>) which he could never oblige God to provide for him: but it is also the Reprobate's own Fault that he heaps up actual Transgressions of his own, for which he needs Repentance; and when he has done, he is so far from repenting heartily of his Sins, that he either hates to be reformed, or traiterously sets up his external, partial Reformation in the Saviour's Throne. Whose Fault was it that <HI>Adam</HI> finned? And whence came the Sinner's corrupt Nature: that Ignorance and Enmity, which is the Root of all the Unbelief,
<PB N="79" REF="004390_0084_100D4E6B97EC8AD0"/>Disobedience and Impenitency therein, for which they are deservedly punished? Was any Violence offered to the pure Will of Man at first? And does not his corrupt Will act freely still? Did the Creator, or any Creature force the Hands of our first Parents to the Tree of Knowledge; or that forbidden Fruit into their Mouths? And having lost their original Rectitude, they could not convey it to their Posterity. Or, is the uni∣versal Law of Nature unjust; that every sort of Creature should propagate it's Kind, in it's own Likeness? <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.12, 21, <HI>to</HI> 28. compar'd with Chap. 5.3. <HI>Adam begat a Son in his own Likeness, after his Image: i. e.</HI> as he was a Man, and as he was a Sinner. Now, if God made Man in his own Image, after his own Likeness; and when he comes to judge him, he finds him in Satan's Likeness, with the very Image of the Devil up∣on him, <HI>Go, ye cursed, into Everlasting Fire, pre∣pared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> will be no un∣righteous Sentence; for <HI>Israel</HI> hath destroyed himself first; and then refused Help through Christ. <HI>Reader,</HI> If thou art not found thus guil∣ty at last, thou shalt not be condemned.</P>
<P N="6">(6) I might appeal to your own Experience, whom the Spirit has convinc'd of Sin; whether you did not see and know it to be your own Fault that you had finned against God; and doubly so, that you had rejected Christ's Authority, as your rightful Lord and King, and his Mercy, as your only Saviour from Sin and Wrath. Suppose, you that are effectually Called had only heard the external Sound of the Gospel, and experienced only a common Work of the Spirit; (thus many
<PB N="80" REF="004390_0085_100D4E37E1A4DAA0"/>are called, who are not chosen, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.14) had you not perished through your own Default? What Thoughts had you of your selves, when you were under the humbling, preparatory Work of the Spirit of Bondage? Did you not plainly see it to be your own Fault that you had finned, and not repented? Were you not brought (tho' it may be, it was long first) to justify God if he should cast you off for ever, because you had forsaken Him? Did you not acknowledge, from the bottom of your Hearts, that if God should deny you his Grace, and leave you to your selves, he could do you no Wrong? Now, either you did wrong in thus judging your selves, or God does right in condemning others, that neither can nor will believe and repent; but are condemned to die, not because they <HI>cannot,</HI> but because they <HI>will not</HI> turn and live. Is it not just, that the Soul which Sins should die and perish, except he repent? And just it cannot be, unless his fin∣ning and not repenting be his own Fault: Hos. 9.15, 17, &amp; 10 2. <HI>I hated them for the wickedness of their Doings. My God will cast them away, be∣cause they did not hearken unto him: Now shall they be found faulty.</HI></P>
<P N="7">(7.) <HI>Finally.</HI> If nothing else will satisfy us, let the uncontroulable, indisputable Supremacy; the absolute, unlimitted Sovereignty; the essential, spotless Righteousness, and infinite Holiness of that GOD who taketh Vengeance, silence all our carnal Reasonings; and set us down satis∣fied with what the Scriptures of Truth inform us concerning this Matter. Now, it is evident by the Word of God, that all impenient Unbelievers
<PB N="81" REF="004390_0086_100D4E6D5C73E7B0"/>shall be damned, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.3. It is also clear, that no Sinner can believe to the saving of his Soul, except almighty Power draw him to Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.44. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19, 20. Nor does the Spirit of God thus irresistibly work Faith in any, but such as were given to Christ, and ordained to eternal Life, thro' him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 10.16, 26. <HI>Act.</HI> 13.48. Yet, that the Unbeliever, obstinately refusing the only Remedy; and God being no ways obliged to overcome this obstinacy, is guilty of his own Death; and must blame himself that he perish∣eth in his Sins, is what the Scriptures also do a∣bundantly assert; either more directly, or by necessary Consequence: Joh. 3.19. <HI>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkness rather than Light.</HI> Prov. 8.36. <HI>He that sinneth against me, wrongeth his own Soul; all they that hate me, love Death.</HI> Joh. 15.22. <HI>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had Sin, but now they have no Cloke for their Sin.</HI> Mat. 22.11, 12, to 15. <HI>And when the King came in to see the Guests, he saw there a Man which had not on a wedding Garment: And he saith unto him, Friend, How camest thou in hither, not hav∣ing a wedding Garment? And he was speechless. Them said the King to the Servants, Bind him Hand and Foot, and take him away; and cast him into outer Darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth: For many are called; but few are chosen.</HI> The whole World of Reprobates shall be like this Man: their Mouths shall be stop'd: Rom. 3.19. <HI>That every Mouth may be stopped; and all the World become guilty before God:</HI> If God hath said it, tho' Man may contradict it; <HI>Let God be true; but
<PB N="82" REF="004390_0087_100D4E396BC01A90"/>every Man a Liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings; and overcome when thou art judged,</HI> Rom. 3.4.</P>
<P>There be many hard Speeches, uttered against Christ's Ambassadors, while they shun not to de∣clare the whole Counsel of God, which will at last be found to have been spoken, by ungodly Sinners against CHRIST; who will, very shortly, make good <HI>Enoch</HI>'s Prophesy, Jude ver. 10.14, 15. <HI>But these speak Evil of those Things which they know not,—And</HI> Enoch <HI>also, the seventh from</HI> Adam, <HI>prophesied of these, saying; Behold, the Lord cometh with ten Thousands of his Saints, to execute Judg∣ment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly Deeds, which they have ungodly committed; and of all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him.</HI> What, though we can't answer Objections so as to stop others Mouths; nor to the silenc∣ing of our own carnal Reasonings, and vanquish∣ing Temptations, for the present; let us leave that Work to Christ; in whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowlege; and in the mean time, hold we close to this, and be sure we keep our hold-fast, that the Word of God is true, the Judge of all the Earth will do right; the foolishness of God is wiser than Men: His Judgments are a great Deep! which the short Line of humane Reason can never sound: What then can be more reasonable, than that our Reason should be brought into Captivity un∣der the Dominion of Faith; 'till Faith shall be swallowed up in Vision? And then we shall know as much of these Things as we can desire
<PB N="83" REF="004390_0088_100D4E6FA1C52828"/>to know; even to full &amp; everlasting Satisfaction. Indeed, if we could now or then comprehend fully the eternal Counsels of him whose Under∣standing is infinite, they would not be worthy of GOD, only Wise: Nor are the Doctrines of God's Sovereignty, and Man's Impotency; Eter∣nal Election, and Free Grace, to be at all sus∣pected, because many wise Men after the Flesh, and most wicked Men, not having the Spirit, do oppose them: On the other Hand; <Q>It is an Effect of Election (saith Mr. <HI>Norton</HI>) to be af∣fected with the Decree of Election. As God openeth himself in no Truth more than this; so they that love to see the shining Face of God in Christ, delight in no Truth more than this.</Q> In this Way, the Riches of Free Grace are glorified to the uttermost; and the poor trembling Believer's Salvation is secured infalli∣bly, abundantly! Whereas, even <HI>Adam</HI> in Pa∣radise, (with all his large Stock of Grace, tho' he had no inward Lust to entice and draw him away) being left to himself soon fell; and Milli∣ons of Angels in Heaven, not being elected (as those that stood are said to be, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.21.) left their own Habitation, even without a Temp∣ter. And yet the poor self conceited Wretch, that knows nothing of the Breadth and Rigour of the Law, or the Riches of Free Grace in the Gospel; nothing of God, or himself, or any Thing else as he ought to know; when he hears the Doctrine of Election preached, either quar∣rels at it, or is discouraged if he gives any Credit to it. It seems to stand in the Way of his Sal∣vation: Oh! If it were not for this Doctrine,
<PB N="84" REF="004390_0089_100D4E3AF7DCCBE8"/>(thinks the proud self Justiciary) I should do well enough: Whereas, all the grounded Hope thou can it have, is from this Doctrine. Were there not a Remnant according to the Election of Grace, God's <HI>Israel,</HI> all <HI>New-England,</HI> yea, and the whole Gospel World would have been like <HI>Sodom,</HI> and like unto <HI>Gomorrah;</HI> not one Soul would have been saved, any more than the fallen Angels. So that not only the Believer, but the uncon∣verted Sinner has cause to bless God for Electi∣on, which refuses not any on the Account of Weakness or Vileness. If then thou seest thy self as unable to believe as a dead Man to rise and walk; and as unworthy that Christ should give thee Life, as are the very Devils; venture all on this Bottom; Christ has not excepted me, in the general Invitations of the Gospel; <HI>Whoso∣ever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely,</HI> Rev. 22.17. Nor may I excuse my self from obeying the Command of God, 1 John 3.23. <HI>This is his Commandment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ:</HI> And tho' I have a natural, strong, rooted Averseness and Enmity, as well as Impotency, that keeps me from osing the only Remedy; yet, GOD can make me willing in the Day of his Power, <HI>Psal.</HI> 110.3. And, if the Eye of electing Love shall pity me, and the Hand of irresistable Power shall draw me, I shall be an eternal Monument of free Grace: Nor will I dare to sit still and cry, <HI>God help me,</HI> any more than to rise up in my own Strength; but wait in the Use of all Means of Grace, avoiding all the Occasions of Sin; and if
<PB N="85" REF="004390_0090_100D4E71AEEEFBF0"/>I perish, I perish justly; if I am saved, 'twill be a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful Salvation!</P>
<P>Let the Enemies of this Doctrine themselves be Judges, whether this be not a more likely Way to obtain the Favour of God, than their Way of contradicting, quarrelling, objecting; or abus∣ing the Doctrine unto a slothful Neglect of the Means; a profane Course of Life, and desperate Way of Sinning; if they are elected they shall be saved, do what they will; if not, they shall be damned, do what they can. They might: as well say, when they are grievously wounded in their Bodies, have their Bones broken, or are dangerously sick; we will use no Means; if it be appointed we shall live, we shall live, do what we will; if our Time be come to die, we shall die, do what we can.</P>
<P>But, to return from this Digression (which may possibly, meet with some lost Sheep, that must be bro't in:) The Objection I am answering (which fell in our Way, as we were arguing the Truth of the second Doctrine, from a sixth Considera∣tion, <HI>viz.</HI> That when the Gospel-Sinner comes to the Place of Torment, he shall see and know that his Destruction is of himself; and conse∣quently the Apprehensions he shall have of the Saints Happiness in Heaven, will the more dread∣fully aggravate his own eternal Misery:) I say, the Objection pleads that the Reprobate is not guilty of Self-Destruction, because not elected, redeemed and sanctified by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: but having found him guilty before God, by clear Scripture Evidence; notwith∣standing all that may be pleaded in his Behalf;
<PB N="86" REF="004390_0091_100D4E3EA9175538"/>we re-assume our former Argument, and close the sixth Consideration, that we may pass to the Seventh: And do Gospel Sinners indeed pull down everlasting Destruction upon their own Heads? What Tongue then can express, or Heart conceive, the least Part of that Soul-killing Rage against themselves, that self-tormenting Fu∣ry, that must needs eternally possess their Souls in Hell; while they shall behold all those, who took a wiser Course, in the Kingdom of God, and themselves thrust out, because they re∣fused to enter in: Here I am, (and shall be, for as many Millions of Ages as there were Minutes from the Creation to the Resurrection; and when that is past, ten Hundred Thousand Million Times more will remain behind;) Here I am, torment∣ed in this Flame; seventy Times seven fold hot∣ter than <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s fiery Furnace; and I wilfully threw my self into this boiling Lake of Fire and Brimstone; O cruelly wounding Tho't! Reader, think not any Pains too much by which thou mayst escape these cruel Lashes of a self∣tormenting Conscience!</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>And lastly,</HI> Such as have once had the Price of the Gospel in their Hands; but had no Heart to improve it, shall for ever remember in Hell, how they sold their immortal Souls, and eternal Joys, for vanishing Trifles; empty Nothings!</P>
<P>How did it vex <HI>Esau,</HI> when he had swallowed down and digested a few Spoonfuls of Pottage, to think that his Birth-right was gone, (and the Blessing must go after it) Heb. 12.16. <HI>Lest there be any Fornicator, or profane Person, as</HI> Esau, <HI>who for one Morsel of Meat sold his Birth-right; For,
<PB N="87" REF="004390_0092_100D4E745E6F5608"/>ye know, how that afterwards, when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected, and found us Place for Repentance, though be sought it carefully with Tears.</HI> Gen. 27.34. <HI>And</HI> Esau <HI>cried with a great and exceeding bitter Cry, and said unto his Father; bless me, even me also, O my Father. And</HI> Esau <HI>lift up his Voice and wept,</HI> ver. 38.</P>
<P>So will the damned Gospel-Despisers weep and wail, and gnash their Teeth, while they consider what they had in Exchange for those Rivers of Pleasure, that flow at God's right Hand for e∣vermore; even a little bitter sweet Pleasure; for an Inch of Time; a thin Bubble of worldly Hon∣our; small, inconsiderable, unsatisfying, unpro∣fitable Gains: As that Prince, who, in his Ex∣tremity sold a Kingdom for one Draught of Wa∣ter; lamenting, sighing, and too late repenting, said, For how short a Pleasure have I sold a Kingdom! Men will say, I have been fool'd out of so much Land, Money, Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and never so much as drank for it. And what have poor lost Souls now to shew for a fair Inheritance above the Stars; which they sold for a Song? How inconsiderable a Part of this inconsiderable World had they; and for how small a Moment did they enjoy this Dream of a Shadow, at the Price of their Souls? Whereas, if they could have grasped and held Possession of the whole World, from the Beginning to the End of Time, on such Terms; it had been a losing Bargain; an undoing Bargain! Mat. 16.26. <HI>For what is a Man profited, if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Or, what shall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="004390_0093_100D4E40B2856D08"/>
If a Man parts with a rich Commodity, or a large Inheritance, for a valuable Consideration; though he should something under sell, it does not much trouble him: Or if he loses a good Bargain, he keeps his Money, and that comforts him: But if he should in a mad Fit, sell first his House and Land, and then his Wife and Children into perpetual Slavery; and all for a Whistle and a Rattle, a guilded Box and a gay Picture; would it not vex his Soul to Death, when he should come to himself, and solemnly reflect on what he had done? Yet this were a tolerable good Bargain, in Comparison of what is made by many Gospel Sinners among us: And whether you believe it or not, sure we are that damned Souls in Hell do know, that the Heighth of their extream Folly has been above all Comparison; and their eternal Vexation of Soul shall be proportionable. Such a Time I was tempted by the Pleasure of Sin, and at another Time the Hook was baited with Gain; but my Conscience told me it was Sin, the Wages of which is Death; and the Word of God informed me, that they which do such Things shall anot in∣herit the Kingdom of God; yet, I did not for∣bear; and now Heaven is gone, and I die like a Fool!— These will be intolerable Thoughts! And yet such as perish from under the Gospel must dwell with such Thoughts, for ever and e∣ver. Oh! that Men were wise, to prevent this in Time. Thus much for the <HI>Second General Head</HI> of our Discourse, under the <HI>Second Doc∣trine.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="89" REF="004390_0094_100D4E761D843A88"/>
III. We might in the third and last Place, yet more particularly make mention of several Sorts of Gospel Sinners, whose eternal Misery shall be peculiarly aggravated; not only above that of the Heathen, but above the Punishment of many of their Fellow-Gospel Sinners; As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Such as have lived in Times and Places when and where many have been converted; Churches greatly inlarged; Multitudes flocking after Christ; Sinners of all sorts and sizes repent∣ing and believing the Gospel, Mat. 21.32. <HI>John came unto you in the Way of Righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the Publicans and Harlots be∣lieved him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterwards, that ye might believe him.</HI> Many of their Acquaintance, of the same Town, in the near Neighbourhood; some of the same Knot of Good-Fellowship, (as they say) their Compani∣ons in Sin, it may be out of the same Family, have turned to the Lord; yea, out of the same Bed one has been taken and the other left: A Yoke-Fellow, a Brother or Sister, a Parent or Child has been perswaded to enter in at the strait Gate; and then by earnest Intreaties and good Instructions, or at least a convincing, winning Example, they have sought to draw you with them, in the Way Everlasting; but you would not hearken; therefore an infinite Evil must come upon you. And when you shall hear many Gos∣pel Sinners pleading, that tho' Religion was pro∣fess'd where they lived, yet it was little practic'd; and if something of the Form was kept up, yet the Power of Godliness was derided by the most;
<PB N="90" REF="004390_0095_100D4E425F7CC2B0"/>and what Hazzards they must have run if they had followed the Lord fully! You shall then re∣member, that though you might have advantag∣ed your Reputation with your Neighbours, by denying all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and by living Soberly, Righteously and Godly; and though you were often ashamed to be found in bad Company, and it was a Discredit to you to turn your Back on the Lord's-Table; and more so to be loose and vain in your Conversations, and hard in your Dealings, notwithstanding your Profession; yet, neither Duty nor Interest, no, not the temporal, spiritual and eternal Advan∣tages that were on Religion's Side, could prevail with you to profess and practise as holy Souls did: It therefore remains, that you chew ever∣lastingly on this bitter Pill; which, if it were possible for your own Consciences to forget, we may suppose Millious of Gospel Sinners to cast in your Teeth, and say, If we had had half the Encouragements to an holy Life, that others were surrounded with, we would never have been so fond of Damnation, as to have crossed even our worldly Interest in pursuing it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such as have had singular Advantages above others, and that many Ways: by their Educati∣on in the Days of their Youth: they have been trained up in the Way they should go; many Thou∣sands of Prayers made with them and for them, in the Family; besides ten Thousand Petitions put up for them by a pious Father, a gracious Mother, in secret Places; who have also, all the Time of their Childhood and Youth, been dropping sweet and solemn Words of Council and Warning into
<PB N="91" REF="004390_0096_100D4E77B8212FB8"/>their Ears; as holy <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Bathsheha</HI> did by young <HI>Solomon,</HI> as himself tells us, Prov. 4.1, 2. — <HI>Hear, ye Children, the Instruction of a Father; and attend to know Understanding: For I give you good Doctrine, forsake you not my Law. For, I was my Father's Son; tender and only beloved in the sight of my Mother. He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thy Heart retain my Words: Keep my Commandments and live. Get Wisdom, get Un∣derstanding; forget it not; neither decline from the Words of my Mouth. Wisdom is the principal Thing; therefore get Wisdom; and with all thy get∣tings get Understanding.</HI> And ver. 13, 14, 15. <HI>Take fast hold of Instruction, let her not go; keep her, for she is thy Life. Enter not into the Path of the Wicked; and go not in the Way of evil Men-Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass a∣way. Put away from thee a froward Mouth, and perverse Lips put far from thee,</HI> ver. 24. Oh! 'Tis an unspeakable Advantage to have a pious Education, holy Examples, good Books, all imaginable Helps, in our tender Years, and after we are grown up: And yet these priviledged Souls, who have had all manner of Helps and precious Means, in publick and private, shall see some, who have been under all Kinds of Disad∣vantages and Hindrances, in the Kingdom of God, and themselves thrust out; but it will kill their Hearts. So much for the second Sort.</P>
<P N="3">3. Such as have had many Convictions, strong Terrors, good Purposes, promising Beginnings; but their Goodness has quickly vanished and dis∣appeared, like the Morning Cloud and early Dew, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.4. These shall come to a fearful End;
<PB N="92" REF="004390_0097_100D4E43EFEFF518"/>unless it please the Lord to move again upon their Hearts, and give them an Heart to comply with those Motions, 2 Pet 2.20, 21, 22. <HI>For of after they have escaped the Pollutions of the World, through the Knowlege of the Lord and Savicur, Jesus Christ, they are again intangled therein, and over∣come; the latter End is worse with them than the Beginning. For it bad been better fir them not to have known the Way of Righteousness, than after they have known it to turn from the holy Commandment, delivered unto them. But it is hapned unto them ac∣cording to the true Proverb; The Dog is turned to his own V mit again; and the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the Mire.</HI> And as this Relapse aggravates their Sin, so their Punish∣ment will be doubly aggravated; That they should begin well, and be almost peswaded, and yet fall off and fall back,—and then that they should sin worse than ever before; at least in this Respect worse, because greater Mercy is a∣bused; more Light sinned against; Job 24.13. <HI>They are of those that rebel against the Light:</HI> But they shall never forget how near they once were to the Kingdom of God, <HI>Mark</HI> 12.34. From whence they are, notwithstanding, fallen into the Bottomless Pit; and, how great is their Fall! How much deeper are they fallen than others, who were never listed up so high! How much better had it been for them not to have had this internal Knowledge, by the Spirit's Con∣viction and Illumination, added to their more common Knowledge by Reading, Hearing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unless they had better improved it? 'Tis a
<PB N="93" REF="004390_0098_100D4E7AF0115028"/>dreadful Thing to increase Knowledge only to the increasing of eternal Sorrow.</P>
<P N="4">4. Such as have made an high Profession, laid themselves under the strictest Covenant Engage∣ments, and frequently renewed their Baptismal Vows at the Lord's Table. That many such shall go to Hell, is a no less certain than sad and awful Truth, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.21, 22. and 8.11, 12. and 25.10, 11, 12. But we needed to have looked no further than the Verses immediately preceed∣ing our Text, for the Confirmation of this so∣lemn Truth, Luke 13.26, 27. <HI>Then shall ye</HI> (and others like them, in after Times) <HI>begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy Presence, and thou bast taught in our Streets. But be shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are: Depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity.</HI> That the professed Followers of an holy JESUS and Pretenders to the strictest Piety should be found the Devil's Children, and Workers of Iniquity, is not more absurd and impious, than their Condemnation will be just, and their Punishment intolerably ag∣gravated: Not because they made so high a Profession; but that they aimed no higher than Self in it. They abuse the richest Favours that are capable of being abased to the Subject's Ruin. They have violated the strongest Engagements that such unsanctified Wretches could be brought under. And perhaps too, they have cloaked their selfish, worldly, hellish Designs with religi∣ous Pretences: <Q>As if one should stop an Oven with a King's Robes.</Q> And shall not their Shame before the World, and Suffering in the Place of Torment, bear a just Proportion to their
<PB N="94" REF="004390_0099_100D7CE029F91248"/>Iniquity and Hypocrisy? This is the Man (it will be known to all) that made not GOD his Hope and Strength; but boasted in the Height of his Privileges, and trusted in the abundance of his Sacrifices: The Righteous shall laugh at him, <HI>Psal</HI> 52.6. And the very Devils will re∣proach him. Yea, such of his Acquaintance in the World as never pertended to such high Things in Religion (tho' they must be damned, not only because they did not believe with their Hearts, but because they did not confess with their Mouths too; both being our indispensible Duty, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10.) yet may taunt at these Hypocrites. But the worst is, GOD has allotted them one of the hottest Rooms in Hell, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. <HI>ult.</HI> Where their own Consciences will for ever sting their Souls with the Remembrance of how much they promised, and how little they per∣formed. How publickly and solemnly they re∣nounced the Flesh, the World and the Devil; and yet, at least more hiddenly, either in Words and Actions, or, be sure, in Heart and Affecti∣on, did follow what they had call'd Heaven to witness of their abandoning. What, for such as have full often drunk of the Cup of the Lord; the Cup of Blessing; the Cup which Christ calls the New Testament in his Blood; instead of go∣ing to drink of the new Wine with Christ in his Father's Kingdom, to have the Cup of Fury and Indignation, Trembling and Astonishment forced into their Hands; full of the Wine of divine Wrath, even the fierceness of his Wrath, with∣out any Mixture of Mercy; and to be made to drink it up, Dregs and all; (for the very Dregs
<PB N="95" REF="004390_0100_100D7B3823913D68"/>of God's Fury are wrung into this Cup) tho' it be Eternity to the Bottom, they must drink it off! But they had better have professed less; or rather more truly, and have practised ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such as have contemned, maligned and most uncharitably censured the precious Saints of GOD, and meek Followers of JESUS, on account of their natural and moral Infirmities, real or supposed; or else because of the outward Meanness of their Condition in the World; yea, very likely, for their real Piety, Integrity and conscientious Walking; but always under Pre∣tence of something else. Now these are of three Sorts;
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) Profligate Wretches, who, like <HI>Cain,</HI> bear a deadly Hatred against the Faithful in Christ Jesus, even because their own Works are evil, and the Believer's righteous; 1 Joh. 3.12, 13. <HI>Not as</HI> Cain, <HI>who was of that Wicked-One, and slew his Brother; and wherefore slew be him? Because his own Works were evil, and his Brother<HI>'s</HI> righteous. Marvel not, my Brethren, if the World hate you.</HI> And the Apostle, in these last Words, does but declare what he heard from Christ's own Mouth: <HI>That which we have seen and heard,</HI> (saith he, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 3.) <HI>declare we unto you,</HI> Thus spake our blessed Lord to his Disciples, John 15.18, 19, 20. <HI>If the World hate you, ye know it bated me before it bated you. If ye were of the World, the World would love his own: But because you are not of the World, but I have chosen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you. Remember the World that I said unto you;
<PB N="96" REF="004390_0101_100D7B3A6E02A7F0"/>The Servant is not greater than the Lord: If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.</HI> There is Persecution with Fire and Swore; and there is Persecution with the Tongue, which is as a sharp Sword, drawn and whet; set on Fire of Hell, Psal. 57.4 <HI>My Soul is among Lions; and I lie even among them that are set on Fire; even the Sons of Men, whose Teeth are Spears and Ar∣rows, and their Tongue a sharp Sword.</HI> Psal. 64.3 <HI>Who whet their Tongue like a Sword; and bend their Bows to shoot their Arrows, even bitter Words.</HI> Isa 57.4. <HI>Against whom do ye sport yourselves? Against whom make ye a wide Mouth, and draw out the Tongue?</HI> Jam. 3.6 <HI>The Tongue is a Fire, a World of Ini∣quity: — It is set on Fire of Hell.</HI> Yea, such as profess Love and Friendship to God's Chosen and called Ones, being unsanctified themselves, have bitter Enmity against them; and may prove the worst of Persecutors; Psal. 55.12, 13, 14. <HI>For it was not an Enemy that reproached me, then I could have born it; neither was it he that bated me</HI> (i. e. with a manifest Hatred) <HI>that did magni∣fy himself against me; then I would have bid my∣self from him. But it was thou, a Man mine E∣qual, my Guide, and mine Acquaintance. We took sweet Counsel together, and walked unto the House of God in Company.</HI> And ver. 21. 'tis added, <HI>The Words of his Mouth were smoother than Butter; but War was in his Heart; his Words were sifter than Oyl, yet were they drawn Swords.</HI> And the very same malicious, persecuting Spirit discovers it self in these Gospel Time: Gal. 4.28, 29. <HI>Now we, Brethren, as</HI> Isacc <HI>was, are the Children of Promise. But as then, he that was born after
<PB N="97" REF="004390_0102_100D7B3C568F0E10"/>the Flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</HI> Profane Sinners hate the Godly: and carnal Professors, who have but the Form of Godliness, can't affect such as have and shew forth the Power of it; for though it pleaseth them in some Respects, yet it crosseth them many Ways. The Flesh and Spirit are Contraries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) The strict Legalist, who trusts in himself that he is righteous, and despiseth others. If he be in Church-Fellowship, he thinks scarce any good enough for his Communion, Isa. 65.5. <HI>Which say stand by thy self, come not near me, for I am holier than thou.</HI> If a Non-Communicant, he thinks the Church so corrupt that he must not hold Communion with them. Are they Men expert in the Letter of the Scriptures? Then they think as the Pharisees spake, (John. 7.49.) of poor, weak, tho' true Believers; <HI>This People who knoweth not the Law, are cursed.</HI> Are their Heads barren even of common Knowledge in re∣ligious Matters? Yet their Hearts (they profess and verily think) are as good as the best Profes∣sor of them all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) Proud and haughty Spirits, if they make some figure in the World, and are Men of Rea∣son: (in their own Account at least) these scorn God's Chosen and precious Ones, because, for the most part, they are poor in the World; James 2.5. <HI>Hearken, my beloved Brethren, hath not God chosen the Poor of this World? But we unto you that are rich; for ye have received your Consolation,</HI> Luke 6.24. And not many of God's Elect, but are poor also in Gifts and Endowments
<PB N="98" REF="004390_0103_100D7B3DE8E30A80"/>of the Mind, whether natural or acquired. Not many wise Men after the Flesh are called: But God hath chosen the foolish, weak, yea and base Things of the World, and such as are de∣spised hath God chosen, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.26, 27, 28. But wo to such as despise, and offend, and cen∣sure, and persecute so much as one of these lit∣tle Ones that believes in Christ; it were better for him that a Mill-Stone were hanged about his Neck, and he were cast into the Sea. Be it on one Account or another, that these and those have despised, disaffected, judged and wronged the Saints of God; when they shall see at last, how that they were the only Excellent of the Earth; precious in the Sight of God as the Ap∣ple of his Eye; and even Kings in disguise: When they shall see them in their royal Appar∣rel, and a Crown royal set upon their Heads, (for thus shall it be done to the Men whom the King of Saints delighteth to honour) how will it cut them to the Heart, and make them gnash their Teeth! How will it ashame and confound them! How will they for ever vex and torment themselves with what they shall have seen and heard, in that Day of Judgment and Recompence! How will GOD repay into their Bosoms, with a Vengeance, all the Indignities they have offer∣ed his dear Children! And indeed, there needs no more to make them miserable, with a Wit∣ness, than for them to be given up into the Hands of their own self-tormenting Thoughts, and cruel Reflections: And must these Objects of our Envy, Malice and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, be embrac'd in the Bosom of divine Love; exalted to an e∣ternal
<PB N="99" REF="004390_0104_100D7B4345230870"/>Throne, and triumph over us, who had thought them as bad as we were, or our selves much better than they were? Are these the Persons, whose Infirmities we derided, whose Company we scorned, and whose very Devotion we mocked? Oh! that we had rather lov'd them, honour'd them, done like them, though we had far'd like them, and like Christ in the World; so should we now have been like them, whom we see (to our inexpressible Vexation and Confusion) to be like Him, in Beauty &amp; Glory: These Reflections, these bitter, cruel Self-Reflec∣tions, are the never-dying-Worm.</ITEM>

<P N="6">6. Such as have had confident Hopes, and high raised Expectations of going to Heaven, their Fall will be the greater. Some there are among the Children of Men who are far from being the Sons of God; yet they lot upon it that they shall go to Heaven when they die, as much as they expect an Harvest after Seed-Time. I spake before of grosser Hypocrites, who deceive others with their outside Shews; but now I aim at close, formal Hypocrites, who deceive them∣selves. <HI>Are we blind also? If any Man seem to be religious,</HI> (so many do in open View of the Church and World, deceiving Men by their outward Appearance, on which only Man can look; but the Apostle adds) <HI>deceiving his own Heart.</HI> These are either more grosly ignorant, such as think that being baptized, if they carry soberly before Men, especially if they make a Profession too, and perform Duties of Religion in publick and private, they shall undoubtedly be saved. Or else they are such as go far beyond
<PB N="100" REF="004390_0105_100D7B471FE48D00"/>these, not only in historical Knowledge and out∣ward Practice; (in which they may exceed even true Christians) but in real Experience of com∣mon Illumination, strong Convictions, &amp; much Comfort in Duty and after Trouble. They oft try themselves and are as oft acquitted by false Signs, or true ones misapplyed. They are well thought of by others like themselves, and even admired by some true Christians; yea, ap∣prov'd possibly, by such as are discerning Chris∣tians, and by Ministers; and they know it, and this s;eals their Delusion, and raises their Expec∣tation to a great Height: So that they may be wonderfully consident of being own'd by CHRIST himself, whose flaming Eye will discover them to themselves and the World, to their unspeak∣able Shame, and more dreadful Disappointment. The higher they were raised by GOD, in com∣mon Gifts of the Spirit; by Men, in charitable Expressions, and real Affection, thro' mistake; and by themselves, through Satan's strong De∣lusions, in glorious Expectations, the deeper will they fall. Stand still, <HI>Reader,</HI> pause a lit∣tle, —and think (what Words can't express) of the Dreadfulness of such a Disappointment!</P>
<P N="7">7. Such as heave had the Unsoundness of their Hopes for Heaven, again and again, plainly discovered; insomuch that their false Peace has been greatly disturbed; and at Times, they have been even convinced that their State and Condition was bad; that they were yet in the Gall of Bitterness and in the Bonds of Iniquity; that another Manner of Work must pass on them, or they perish for ever. Yet, for all this, like
<PB N="101" REF="004390_0106_100D7B5B9F8B7C38"/>fool-hardy Wretches, they have shut their Eyes against this Light of Conviction, (that might have prov'd the Dawning of sound Conversion, and eternal Salvation to them;) and ventured on over the Precipice, chusing the Terrors of the Second-Death, rather than the Pangs of the New-Birth; and to be at the Cost of laying a new Foundation. Sometimes they have thought they would let go their false Hold; but then, finding themselves destitute of any Footing, fall∣ing and sinking, and fearing they should be dash∣ed in Pices or drowned, they must catch hold of something; some where they must fasten; Des∣pair is dreadful! And being ignorant of the Way of Salvation, by believing in him that justifies the Ungodly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. (which indeed is a Mis∣tery, hidden from the greatest Part of Professors) they must (I say) catch hold some where, as drowning Men; and the rotten Stick of self∣righteous Performances is what comes next to Hand, and they can reach no further: If they think, now they will come off from Self and Duties, and lean on CHRIST only, 'tis with a Faith of their own forging; they do but re∣pair the old House, which must be pulled down to the Ground, and removed, every Stick of it, and the Foundation ripped up, that they may be created a new, in Christ Jess to good Works: founded on him, and built up in him: But, Oh! how averse are our old Covenant Hearts from this new and living Way, when opened in the Gospel! Salvation by Works, a Dispo∣sition to work for Wages and earn Heaven, was the first Liquor that was put into the Vessel of
<PB N="102" REF="004390_0107_100D7B5D4E505A38"/>humane Nature and it strongly savours of it to this Day; according to the true Proverb, <HI>That which is bred in the Bone, will never out of the Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, I have diverted a little, to shew you one main Cause of that extreme Difficulty Minis∣ters find, in removing Men from their old, false Foundations: And when they have done all, Multitudes will hold fast their own Self-Deceiv∣ings. They will put new Patches on the old, ragged Garment; they will seem to mend their Pace; but 'tis in the old, broad, beaten Path. Yea (to retun) they will shut their Eyes (as was said) against the plainest Conviction; and ven∣ture on in a Way, they are so oft and faithfully told, will end in their shameful and intolerable Disappointment.</P>
<P>Thus the Damned in Hell, especially such as perish from under the Gospel, and peculiarly some Sorts of Gospel Sinners that have been mentioned, shall have such Apprehensions of the Saints Happiness in Heaven, as will dreadfully aggravate their own eternal Misery.</P>
<P>So much may serve for the <HI>Doctrinal Part</HI> of the <HI>second Point.</HI></P>
<P>The APPLICATION of the Whole remains.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE I. For INFORMATION and INSTRUCTION, in seve∣ral Lessons.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Shall many, that now enjoy the Means of Grace with the People of God here, be Cast∣aways hereafter? Then in must needs be a great
<PB N="103" REF="004390_0108_100D7B5EF9CF87B0"/>Mistake, to think that all or most Church-Mem∣bers shall be saved: Yet, some there are so grosly ignorant and lavishly charitable, as to think and speak as if it were so: But the holy Scriptures are the Rule of our Charity; and they assure us that many are called but few chosen: That many shall say, We have eat and drunk in thy Presence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Besides, Ex∣perience tells us, that all Church-Members are not like <HI>Zecharias</HI> and <HI>Elisabeth,</HI> who were both righteous before God, walking in all the Com∣mandments and Ordinances of the Lord blame∣less. And do not the Consciences of some Pro∣fessors tell them, that, how smoothly soever they carry it before Men, yet, they live in the Neglect of Closet Duty, and in the Allowance of secret Sins; at least, some one Way and Trade of Sin, which is inconsistent with Sinceri∣ty. Others there may be, who don't know that they allow themselves any Sin, yet they never experienced a thorough Work of Conversion: They were never Heart sick of Sin; nor bro't off from self-Righteousness: What they do is not out of Love to Christ who died for Sinners: Now, we know that nothing avails without Faith that works by Love, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is it only now for the present Time of Life and State of Trial, that the Elect and Repro∣bates, Saints and Hypocrites do join, visibly, to∣gether in the Worship of God; must they be seperated at Death and Judgment, as we have heard? Well then may they both be content to bear the Trouble of each others Company in this World. Thou false Heart! Does the more
<PB N="104" REF="004390_0109_100D7B6339FBB060"/>gracious Converse; or did the more experimen∣tal Relation of thy Fellow-Communicant trouble thee, because is condemns thee? Art thou thus silently, or more directly and expresly reprov∣ed by him? Is there secret Enmity in thy Heart against him? Would thy envious Heart be gland to have this Eye-Sore removed? Comfort thy self in this! 'Twill be but a little while before you shall be parted far enough asunder. On the other Hand, Is thy righteous Soul, upright-Hearted <HI>Nathaniel,</HI> not only vexed with the silthy Conversation of the more openly Wicked; but grieved also with the unsavoury Spirit of the hypocritical Professor? Yet a little while and the Wicked shall not be: Thou shalt have no more of this, or any other Kind of Trouble for ever. In the mean Time, consider him who endured such Contradiction of Sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your Minds, Ye have not yet resisted unto Blood, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.3, 4.</P>
<P N="3">3. Shall their Distance in the other Wolrld be as great as is between Heaven and Hell? Then the Wicked have, be sure, no less Reason to dread, than the Godly have to desire the Coming of the LORD, by Death or Judgment. It was one of <HI>John</HI>'s Visions, Rev. 6.8. <HI>I looked, and behold a pale Horse; and his Name that sat on him was Death; and Hell followed.</HI>—To die, and go to Hell; the Resurrection of Damnation; the Coming of Christ in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance on the Ignorant and Disobedient; what a dreadful Sound should these Things make in the Ears of nominal Christians, luke∣warm
<PB N="105" REF="004390_0110_100D7B64E2FF51F0"/><HI>Laodiceans,</HI> and self righteous Pharisees, (who are, at best, but ignorant Zealots, <HI>Rom</HI> 10. <HI>begin.</HI>) as well as of the most profane and open∣ly Scandalous!</P>
<P>But, is the Life thou now livest in the Flesh by the Faith of the Son of God? then to die will be Gain. Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord; for they rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them. Thou hast all the Reason in the World for thy Desire to de∣part, and to be with Christ, which is best of all. Let this be the constant Language of thy Soul, <HI>Come</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>come quickly.</HI> The Day of they Death will be better than was the Day of thy Birth, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.1. This being the Begin∣ning of all thy evil Things; and that the End thereof, and the Beginning of that infinite Good that shall never end.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Again.</HI> Shall this seperation be forced on the Wicked, sore against their Will? Why then should any be so unadvised, besotted, and (to use the Apostle's Word) so bewitched as to chuse the Ways of Sin, and refuse those of Holiness now, seeing they shall be so contrarily affected towards the respective Ends unto which these Ways lead, in the other World? <HI>Knowest thou not that it will be Bitterness in the latte End? His Bones are full of the Sins of his Youth, which shall lie down with him in th Dust, Tho' Wick∣edness be sweet in his Mouth; though he bide it un∣der his Tongue; though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his Mouth: Yet, his Meat in his Bowels is turned; it is the Gall of Asps within him,</HI> Job 20.11,—Who would
<PB N="106" REF="004390_0111_100D7B6672CE7070"/>not chuse rather to suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin (were they ten thousand Times sweeter than they are) for a Moment? Didst thou but realized it now, that Death and Judgment will change thy Mind; thou wouldst certainly desire and endeavour, presently to change thy Way. Put Sin and Hell together in one Scale, and Self-Denial with eternal Glory in the other; and if thou hast but hte Reason of a Man; one would think, that far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory (with which neither the Suffer∣ings nor Injoyments of this present Time are worthy to be compared) should soon determine thy Choice. But alas! The Word preached (or written) does not profit, not being mixed with Faith in them that hear (or read) it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.2.</P>
<P N="5">5. Is it as we have heard in the second Doc∣trine, That the Damned in Hell shall have such Apprehensions of the Saints Happiness in Hea∣ven, as will dreadfully aggravate their own eternal Misery? Hence, Places of Gospel-Light are dear Places to sin in. The Wages of Sin (even of all Kinds of Sin, of each single Act in any Kind) is Death, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. The Soul that sins shall die, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.4. So that none of the ungospellized World can sin at a cheap Rate: The Wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God, <HI>Psal</HI> 17.9. Yet, <HI>Israel,</HI> the Seed of <HI>Jacob</HI> whom God loved, be∣cause they had his Word nad Ordinances, which other Nations had not; because they only, of all the Families of the Earth, were thus highly privi∣ledged, thus nearly related to God; their Sins
<PB N="107" REF="004390_0112_100D7B7D95B651B0"/>were the more grievous; Amos 2.13. <HI>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a Cart is pressed that is full of Sheaves,</HI> Isa. 1.2, 14. <HI>I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have rebelled against me. I am weary to bear them.</HI> Ezek. 6.9. <HI>I am broken with their whorish Heart.</HI> And their Punishment must be more heavy; Amos 3.2. <HI>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore you I will punish,</HI> with a Winess; with a Vengeance; in Jealousy and Fury. But we, in these Gospel Times; we in this Land of Light! How dear must we pay for all our ungrateful Disobedience; our wilful Barrenness? Unless we agree with our Adversary quickly, whiles we are in the Way with him, <HI>Mat 5.25</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. What we have heard under the second Doctrine, does abundantly justify the incessant, unwearied Care and Pains of the most circum∣spect, diligent Christian in the World; and may equally serve to comfort such under all their Labours, Sorrows and Sufferings, in the Way to Heaven: Luke 13.24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait Gait; for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and not be able.</HI> Heb. 3.19. and 4.1. <HI>So we see that they could not enter in, because of Unbelief. Therefore let us fear, lest a Promise being left us of entring into his Rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</HI> Prov. 28.14. <HI>Happy is the Man that feareth always.</HI> Heb. 12.15. <HI>Looking diligently, lest any Man fail of the Grace of God.</HI> 2 Pet. 3.10, 14. <HI>But the Day of the Lord will come, as a Thief in the Night Wherefore be diligent, that ye may be found of him in Peace.</HI> And ver. 11. <HI>What Manner of Persons
<PB N="108" REF="004390_0113_100D7B7F1974B940"/>ought ye to be, in all holy Conversation and Godli∣ness? Be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might. Put on the whole Armour of God: Praying always, with all Prayer,—and watching thereunto with all Perseverance,</HI> Eph. 6.10, 11, 18. <HI>Fight the good Fight of Faith: Lay hold on eter∣nal Life: So run that ye may obtain,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.12. 1 Cor. 9.24.</P>
<P>These are hard Lessons! But if we be stead∣fast, unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; we know that our Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. If we suffer with him, we shall be glorified together. He that overcomes, shall sit down with Christ, on his Throne; as he also overcame, and is set down with his Father, on his Throne. Suppose the worst, that it should come to Burning at the Stake; that's better than burning for ever in Hell. Should the World that hates us, gnash on us with their Teeth, and stone us to Death; this is not half so bad as what is expressed in our Text, <HI>There shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth, when ye shall see</HI> Abraham, &amp;c. <HI>in the King∣dom of God, and you your selves thrust out.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Shall the Damned in Hell have such Ap∣prehensions of the Saints Happiness in Heaven, as will dreadsully aggravate their own eternal Misery? No doubt then but glorified Saints shall find their everlasting Joys proportionably height∣ned, while they consider the Sorrows of the Tormented. Not that they shall rejoyce in that Misery of their Fellow-Creatures which them∣selves have deserved as well and as much, and many of them more than most of the Damned:
<PB N="109" REF="004390_0114_100D7B80E31819B0"/>But this shall be their Rejoycing, that they are delivered from so great a Death as the second Death is, Rev. 21.8. <HI>compar'd with</HI> I Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. <HI>But the Fearful, and Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liars, shall have their Part in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone; which is the second Death. Know ye not that the Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: Neither For∣nicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Ef∣feminate, nor Abusers of themselves with Man∣kind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God: And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are jus∣tified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> And shall we not for ever re∣member, when we come to the Region of Light and Bliss, how far we ran in Sin; how long we played on the Brink of Heil; and how loth we were at last to be saved in GOD's Way? Though he had sent his Son to endure his burn∣ing Wrath for us; and did send his Spirit to pluck us as Brands out of the Fire; while Mul∣titudes were left to perish for lack of Vision: and most, who had the Light, were left, in their Blindness, to love Darkness rather than Light; and are therefore justly condemned to Blackness of Darkness for ever; because they hated the Light of Truth and Grace, they shall never see the Light of Glory; unless with such Apprehensions, Flashing in their Minds, as make Hell the darker and hotter.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="004390_0115_100D7B8597F49180"/>
So, on the other Hand, (as we are arguing) the black Night of eternal Death makes the perfect Day to shine the brighter. The Howl∣ing of the Dogs which are without, (Rev. 22.15) makes the Hallelujahs of Saints, the Songs of <HI>Ston</HI> to be the more Joyful &amp; Melodious. If there were no Hell; or none but Devils in it; or but few of the Children of Men, and those only such as had been the least of Mortals, or greatest of Sinners; Heaven would be the less Glorious; and its high Arches would not have rung so loud and sweetly of SALVATION! SALVATION! <HI>Rev.</HI> 7.10 &amp; 19.1. Neither would there have been room for that new Song, Rev. 5.9. At least the Tune of it must have been set lower; <HI>And they song a new Song, say∣ing, Thou art worthy, — for thou wast slain; and bast redeemed us to GOD, by the Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</HI> And they shall rejoyce also, unconceivably, and be glad with exceeding Joy, in the Triumphs of divine Justice, when they shall see the Ven∣geance, <HI>Psal</HI> 58.9, 10. Themselves are by a Mi∣racle of Grace wonderfully delivered, which will be fresh and new to Eternity; because the Smoke of Hell's Torment will ascend (as it were in their Sight) for ever and ever: And GOD's Power, Justice and Truth are glorified to the Height; and therefore they rejoyce; Rev. 18.20 and 19 1, 2 — <HI>Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven, and ye holy Apostles and Prophets; for GOD hath aven∣gedy a on her. After these Things I heard a great Voice of much People in Heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and Honour, and Glory, and Power to
<PB N="111" REF="004390_0116_100D7B87D78F3830"/>the LORD our GOD: For true and righteous are his Judgments. And again they said Halleluia; and her Smoke rose up for ever and ever. And a Voice came out of the Throne, saying, Praise our GOD, all ye his Servants, and ye that fear him, both Small and Great: Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give Honour to him.</HI></P>

<HEAD>USE II. For EXAMINATION.</HEAD>
<P>2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your selves, whether ye be in the Faith: Prove your own selves: Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</HI></P>
<P>And to excite you to this much neglected Work, consider a few Things;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You have to do, and must have further to do with an omniscient, impartial Judge; Rev. 2.23 <HI>And all the Churches shall know, that I am be which searcheth the Reins and the Hearts: And I will give unto every one of you according to your Works.</HI> Rom. 2.16. <HI>God shall judge the Se∣crets of Men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gos∣pel.</HI> Be not deceived; your great JUDGE can∣not be blinded, or bribed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 The final Determination of your eternal State may be much nearer than you suspect or imagine. As it is appointed unto Men once to die, but after this the Judgment: So are his Days determined; the Number of his Months are with the Lord, who has appointed his Bounds that he cannot pass, <HI>Job.</HI> 14.5. And as the
<PB N="112" REF="004390_0117_100D7B8A48030A68"/>Tree falls, so must it lie. If thy Soul should this Night be required of thee; and thou disco∣verest not thy Condition before thou sleepest; thou mayst be undone for ever by thy present Delay. <HI>Where is the Hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul? Thou Fool, this Night shall thy Soul be required of thee.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For want of a thorough Search, Multitudes are mistaken, on one Hand or the other; and on both Hands Mistakes are sad, tho' not alike dangerous, and of dreadful Consequence. <HI>There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath Nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great Riches,</HI> Prov. 13.7. How sadly do many Christians walk, to their own Discomfort, and the Discouragement of others, and the LORD's Dishonour, in whom they should always rejoyce; How are their Hands weakned in the Service of God; when the Joy of the Lord would be their Strength? <HI>Neh.</HI> 8.10. And all for want of discovering the Sincerity of their Hearts; which they might do, by divine Assistance, in one Hour's diligent search into their Hearts; and how cheap a Remedy is this for Months and whole Years of Darkness, and cruel Jea∣lousy of the Love of Christ; their's to him, or his to them? <HI>Cant.</HI> 8.6. On the other Hand, there is a Way that seems right to a Man; but the End thereof are the Ways of Death: And it is for want of impartial Examination that this Man is mistaken for the present, and undone for ever.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="113" REF="004390_0118_100D7B8C102C2EB8"/>
4. It may be of unspeakable Advantage to know our present State of Soul, whether it be good or bad. If, after the most laborious and critical Search, we find a Grain of true Grace, we shall have more Cause of Joy, than if we had found a Wedge of Gold; Prov. 3.13, 14, 15. <HI>Happy is the Man that findeth Wisdom, (i. e.</HI> true saving Grace) <HI>For the Merchandize of it is better than the Merchandize of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold: It is more precious than Rubies; and all the Things thou canst desire cannot be compared to it.</HI> And if, on Trial, our present State appear to be unsound, we have then the most happy Season, perhaps, that ever we had in our Life Time, to make our selves for ever: For, what is it that undoes a great Part of those who perish from under the Gospel, but a false Hope? <HI>Job</HI> 27.8. What is the Hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul? You are willing in tem∣poral Cases to know the worst: When travel∣ling, to be told if you take a wrong Way, be∣fore you have utterly lost your self, and your Feet stumble upon the dark Mountains: If go∣ing to Law, you intreat your Counseller not to flatter you with vain Hopes; but to tell you the worst you may expect, if you proceed. If go∣ing to Sea, you would not ship your self on a false Bottom; if you hear but a Sound that the Passengers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are like to be cheated of their Lives. And as a timely Discovery of Danger pre∣vents Ruin in these and such like temporal Cases; so may the Discovery of your spiritual State, if at present bad, prevent your everlasting Destruction.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="114" REF="004390_0119_100D7B8E65B57CF8"/>
5. Your Unwillingness to know the worst of your selves, and to come to the strictest Trial in order thereto, will render any further Tryal the less needful; and your Willingness to be search'd to the Bottom, will make such a Work the more easy. I say not that every one who is backward to examine himself is therefore un∣sound: The Flesh draws back from all spiritual Duties: And it may be the weak and tempted Soul has tried and tried again, has been so long and often at the Work of Self-Examination, and still unresolved, that it is quite disheartned; yet can pray with <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 139.23. <HI>Search me, O God, and know my Heart.</HI> If there were a Man a thousand Miles off that could tell the doubting Christian his State, infallibly, he would not think the Journey long, to be resolv'd in a Case that lies nearest his Heart of any Thing in the World. Nor can we say that every one who is willing to be tried is therefore upright of Heart; for many have a strong Confidence of their good Estate, though groundless; now, these, resolving what to judge before Hand, may boldly come to the Trial. And then, the Spirit of Conviction can make an elect Soul (at pre∣sent on a false Foundation) willing to come to the Trial, in order to his Conversion and Sal∣vation. But ordinarily, such as are willing to be search'd, especially when they most suspect themselves, are honest hearted; and such as don't love the most searching Books and Sermons are naught. If you saw the Merchant loth you should view and try his Wares, would you not suspect them the more? <HI>Every one that doth
<PB N="115" REF="004390_0120_100D7B91E73D5578"/>Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his Deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth Truth, cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God,</HI> John 3.20, 21.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Now, I will suppose thee, Reader, at a Loss about thy spiritual Condition; and, at least in some Measure, willing to come to the strictest Tryal, and resolved to ingage thy backward Heart in this Work; a Work which no Minister or Fellow-Christian can do for thee; it is Self-Examination. <HI>What Man knows the Things of a Man, save the Spirit of Man that is within him?</HI> But sure, a Man may know himself, else it would be very strange: <HI>Know ye not your own selves?</HI> says the Apostle. In the diligent Use of Means you may, if you are but willing: If then you are willing to set about this Work, take two or three Directions for your Help and Guidance herein, that you may not do the Work to the Halves, that it may not miscarry under your Hand.</P>

Take Time and Pains; yea, take the best Time that may be; when your Minds are most calm, and free of worldly Cares, and perplexing Temptations: Be serious and so∣lemn: Set your selves as at the Feet of Christ, and under the Observance of his flaming Eve, who is the All-seeing and Heart-searching GOD: And watch over your wandring, slothful and deceitful Hearts, from the Beginning to the End of the Work. Look into the Scriptures, or searching Books; then look into your own Heart, and compare diligently your former
<PB N="116" REF="004390_0121_100D7B9429233060"/>Experiences and present Desires, Frame and Bent of Heart with those Marks and Signs: Bu first and last, you must be sure to look up to GOD for Understanding in the Rule, and Skill to apply it; and for the Co witnessing of his Spirit, ac∣cording to that of the Apostle, Tom. 8.16. <HI>The Spirit it self bears Witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</HI> It's true; The Testi∣mony of a renewed Conscience is a good Evi∣dence for us, and solid Ground of Joy, 2 Cor. 1.12. <HI>Our Rejoycing is this; the Testimony of our Consciences, &amp;c.</HI> Because <HI>the Son of God hath given us</HI> (as another Apostle tells us 1 John 5.20.) <HI>an Understanding that we may know, &amp;c.</HI> Yet if we consider it as distinct from the Witness of the Spirit, it's never without the gracious Assis∣tance of the Spirit; and though it be very com∣fortable, yet not fully satisfying without the Spirit's Testimony. <HI>Our Gospel came to you in— the Holy Ghost, and much Assistance,</HI> 1 Thes. 1.5.</P>
<P><HI>Direct.</HI> 2. See to the Marks and Signs you try by, that they be sound and good: This is of eternal Concernment; and so it is that you miss it not in the Application. If the Mark be false, you may stand before it, and yet fall be∣fore God; who will judge you by his infallible Word of Truth: From thence therefore you must take your Signs; and when you have done so, you must be impartial in the Trial; not prejudging the Cause, nor suffering your self to be by assed, by carnal Self-Love to one Side, nor by jealous trembling Fears to the o∣ther; but resolving to judge of your selves, as you shall now find upon Trial.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="004390_0122_100D7B96C57A67A0"/>
<HI>Direct.</HI> 3. Draw up no hasty Conclusion, for or against your self; nor let it go in Haste, when deliberately and regularly drawn. Our first and sudden Thoughts, in any difficult Matter, are very often wrong. <HI>He that answereth a Matter before be heareth it,</HI> (saith the wise Man) <HI>it shall be Shame and Folly to him.</HI> It may be Death and Damnation in the Case now before us. We must hear both Sides, and hear all, before we can judge in the trivial Matters of this Life; how much more when the State of the Soul is to be judged, where a Mistake may cost us as much more than our Lives are worth as our Life is more than a Button of our Coat. Have we a Mark of a good State given in a Sermon? We must keep it in Mind, recollect it in private, and diligently compare our selves with it: Have we a Sign of Grace in a Book before our Eyes? Let us read it over and over; pondering every Part of it in our Hearts; considering where the main Strength of the Sign lies. As now, to give an Example for the Help of the Weak: We have an infallible Mark of a good State in 1 John 3.14. <HI>We know that we are passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren.</HI> When I try my State by this Mark, it's none of my Business to enquire, How I shall infalllibly know who are Christ's Disciples indeed: It's enough that I know who I am bound in Charity to look on as gracious Persons: The main Thing that I am to inquire after is, Whither I do indeed love such as I regularly look on to be the Chil∣dren of GOD, because of the Image of the holy GOD, that I do, as it were, see upon him?
<PB N="118" REF="004390_0123_100D7B98583BA8B8"/>Whether the real Ground of my Love to Christ's Disciples be this; That they love Christ, and Christ loves them; and whether the more Christ like they are, the more dearly I affect them? and whither upon new, and further, and clearer Discoveries of their experimental Knowledge of Jesus Christ, (for legal Exactness is nothing without this) the more sensibly and sweetly is my very Soul united and glewed to them: their Company is sweet; their very Countenance seems pleasant; and I find my self willing to do or part with any Thing for them, when called? How freely do Parents do for their Children, because they are dear to them? So it is in this Case, in some Measure: 1 John 3.17, 18, 19. <HI>Whoso hath this Worlds Goods, and seeth his Bro∣ther hath need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Com∣passion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him? My Little Children, let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue; but in Deed and in Truth. And hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and shall assure our Hearts before him.</HI></P>
<P>Now, on the other Hand; if I am but a le∣gal Self-Justiciary, I shall find, upon Exami∣nation, (if I am not so confident as to need no further Trial; at least I may find, but that I am exceeding loth to see it) that I have no such special Love and dear Affection to gracious Souls, to savoury, experienc'd Christians. My Heart, it may be, tells me that I love good Peo∣ple, and always did: My Parents were godly, and I was educated into the good Esteem of the People of GOD. I loved my Parents, with a natural Affection; and so I love such as they
<PB N="119" REF="004390_0124_100D7B9B6B4D1D10"/>loved, and as loved them: And I love good Folks because they are sober and honest, and do Good to my self and others: I cannot endure profane, and wicked, and dishonest People: But as for that dear Affection to experienc'd Christians, as they are called, I don't know what you mean by it. Their Relations of strange Joys and Terrors, Light and Darkness, and Temptations, may be melancholly Fancies, Dreams and Delusions, for ought I know: I fear, if they are right, I should be found wrong, (says the self-righteous Man, whose Enmity works strangely at the hearing so much of Ex∣periences) and then how can I love such as con∣demn me, Gal. 4.28, 29. <HI>Now, we Brethren, as</HI> Isaac <HI>was, are the Children of Promise. But as then, he that was born after the Flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</HI></P>
<P>Still I would gladly be further helpful to you in this necessary, but difficult and very impor∣tant Work; by laying down variety of Marks and Signs of Grace: such as will not deceive you, if you do not deceive your selves by mis∣applying them, either for or against your selves: For they shall all be taken out of the infallible Word of Truth. But first let me premise two Things;
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That a sincere Christian may much sooner and more easily discover his Sincerity, than a Formalist can his Hypocrisy. It must needs be so, ordinarily; for the Convert knows what it is to be an Hypocrite: He can tell how his Heart stood affected in his natural State; and now he can compare former with present Expe∣riences.
<PB N="120" REF="004390_0125_100D7B9EDD1AAF00"/>Moreover, It is of the Nature of Light to make manifest; <HI>Once were ye Darkness,</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>but now ye are Light in the Lord.</HI> And then, the Spirit of Truth and Re∣velation dwells in them, and that partly for this End, 1 Cor. 2.12. <HI>Now we have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things that are freely given us of God.</HI> Whereas supernatural Things are incomprehensible by the natural Man; what ever common Light and Knowledge he may have: So that when he comes to examine his State, he knows not what he is to look for: if he be told never so plainly, he may easily mis∣take: If he looks into his Heart, it is like a dark Dungeon, where you may look long enough, and grope in vain for the brightest Object, if it be very small; though it would be very plain by the least Candle-Light: Not that there is any Grace, by the Light of the Noon-Day Sun, to be discovered in his Heart; yet there is pre∣vailing Enmity against Christ, and the Way of Salvation by a Self-denying Faith in him; and yet he cannot see it by reason of Darkness. He hates his Brother, because of the Image of Christ that he bears; yet he neither will see it, nor can he, so as the gracious Soul may see and feel his Love to the precious Image of Christ, where∣ever he sees it; though it were in the meanest Negro-Slave; or in one that, through mistake, may misjudge and disaffect him. The Children of this World are, ordinarily, wiser than the Children of Light, in earthly Matters; but set them on such a Work, as I am now speaking
<PB N="121" REF="004390_0126_100D7BA1DE1B8500"/>of, and they are all in Confusion. Besides, they can't endure Searching; whereas it is the very Thing the true Convert's Heart is set upon: <HI>What shall I do to be saved? And how shall I know whether my Heart be right with God?</HI> And herein he had a great Advantage for the Disco∣very of his Sincerity; whiles the false Heart is under all Manner of Disadvantages; yet GOD can discover him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) In this Use, we are not trying the Quan∣tity of Grace, with Scales and Weights or Measures; but the Quality of it, as with a Touch-Stone. One single Grain of Gold is as truly Gold as a Talent. Indeed, it's no good Sign, when we are always enquiring after the sinallest Measure of true Grace: And if we de∣sire no more Grace than just to save us from Hell, and for no higher End, we shall never ge to Heaven: Nevertheless, we must first bring our Grace to the Touch-Stone, to try of what Kind it is; and then, after we have found it true; and that we are new born; and in the narrow Way; we must, from Time to Time, weigh and measure our Increase, Stature and Progress.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But the Question now to be decided is, <HI>Whe∣ther we have saving Faith as a Grain of Mustard-Seed?</HI> Whether we be in the Faith, according to the fore-mentioned 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. Not whe∣ther we be strong in the Faith: To be so is our Duty; but that is our Life.</P>
<P>Now I come to lay down the Marks and Signs, by which the doubting Soul may judge his spi∣ritual State according to the Scriptures.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="004390_0127_100D7BA5A2734660"/>
[<HI>Mark</HI> 1.] A sensible, working Affection to such as we apprehend to be the Children of God by Faith in Christ, because of their Relation to God in Christ, and for his holy Image which they bear; how be it they may differ from us in their Opinion, and it may be disaffect us too, on one Account or another; 1 Joh. 3.14. <HI>We know that we are passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren.</HI> Psal. 16.3. <HI>The Saints that are in the Earth,</HI> (are) <HI>the Excellent, in whom is all my Delight.</HI> Mark. 9.41. <HI>Whoso∣ever shall give you a Cup of Water to drink in my Name, because you belong to me,</HI> (mark that, be∣cause you belong to me) <HI>he shall not loose his Re∣ward.</HI> Jam. 1.17. <HI>The Wisdom from above is pure, peaceable,—without Partiality.</HI></P>
<P>[<HI>Mark</HI> 2.] To love our personal Enemies, such as hate, reproach, or any, yea it may be many Ways wrong us, so as to forgive them from our Hearts, pray for them, and return Good for Evil; and that in Obedience to the Com∣mand of God, and from a Sense of his pardoning Mercy to us thro' Christ, who while we were yet Enemies died that we might live, and has freely forgiven us ten thousand Talents: When, by these Considerations, we are moved to forgive, and wish all Good to the worst of our private Ene∣mies, 'tis an infallible Sign of Grace; accord∣ing to <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.43. <HI>and onward. Chap.</HI> 6.12, 14, 15. <HI>Chap.</HI> 18.35. <HI>Mark</HI> 11.25, 26. <HI>Luke</HI> 6.37. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.32 <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.17, 19, 20, 21. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Acts</HI> 7.59, 60.

<P><PB N="123" REF="004390_0128_100D7BA928FCC470"/>
(<HI>Mark</HI> 3.) A Care to maintain good Works (whereby we are conformed to Christ's Exam∣ple, do shew our Thankfulness for our free Jus∣tification, and are meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,) as if we were to merit Hea∣ven by our Works: And, at the same Time, depending on what Christ has done and suffered for our Justification before God, as if no good Works were required of us; <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5, 6. <HI>Phil.</HI> Works were required of us; <HI>Rom</HI> 4.5, 6. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.3, 3, 9. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3, 8. <HI>Luke</HI> I. 74, 75.</P>
<P>(<HI>Mark</HI> 4) A new, sweet and sensible Dispo∣sition of Soul to approve our selves to God, in of Soul to approve our selves to God, in singleness of Heart, rather than to Men, in what we do, is a sure Sign of Grace; according to 3.22, 23, 24. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.8.</P>
<P>(<HI>Mark</HI> 5.) An Heart sweetly disposed to fetch Strength from Christ to perform Duties; and to deny ourselves and acknowledge him in all we do as well as receive, is another sweet Sign of a supernatural Principle and new Nature; <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.2. <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.3.1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.13, 14. <HI>Psal.</HI> 116.1, 2.</P>
<P>(<HI>Mark</HI> 6.) Divine Breathings and Thristings after Communion with God in Duty, and the sensible Manifestations of his Love in Christ Je∣sus to our souls, is another Property of one that is born again, created a new, and redeem'd from the Earth; and is found in no Hypocrite in the World; <HI>Psal.</HI> 42.1, 2. <HI>Cant.</HI> 8.6 <HI>Psal.</HI> 73. as. <HI>and</HI> 27.4, 8.</P>
<P>(<HI>Mark</HI> 7.) Earnest Desires after the Conver∣sion of Souls; even of all that we know and converse with; especially of our natural Rela∣tions, and intimate Friends and Acquaintance;
<PB N="124" REF="004390_0129_100D7BABD570D4A0"/>yea of our publick as well as personal Enemies, much rather (if it may be the Will of God) than their Destruction; and of those too that are most nemote from us, such as we neve saw, <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> not only customary praying for, but inwardly defiring their Conversion; accord∣ing to <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.1. <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.18. <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.6,—9. And a proportionable Joy when Sinners are converted, and lost Sheep found; 2 <HI>John</HI> 4 <HI>and</HI> 3 <HI>John</HI> 3.</P>
<P>(<HI>Mark</HI> 8.) An hearty Rejoycing when the Interest of Christ and Religion, and the publick Good in Church or Common Wealth, is promot∣ed any Way, though we have had no Hand in <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Numb.</HI> 11.29.</P>
<P>(<HI>Mark</HI> 9.) When our Souls hate Sin as Sin, and so all Sin, in Heart and Life, whether open or sencret, in ourselves or others; but most in ourselves, and most of all our Bosom Sin, the Sin that does so easily beset us; grieving for God's Dishonour by others Sins; but loathing ourselves for the working of Sin in our own Hearts, though it break not our to our Discre∣dit; <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.113, 128, 158. <HI>and</HI> 18 23 <HI>Gen.</HI> 39.9. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.31, 32. <HI>Job</HI> 42. <HI>begin. Heb.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Gal</HI> 5.17 <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.15, 24.</P>
<P>(<HI>Mark</HI> 10.) In a Word, The true Convert has an abiding Sense of his own Vileness; and to find Christ, and be found in him, is all his Desire.</P>
<P>I would a little enlarge on this last Sign of Grace, as I endeavoured to explain the first; though I could but barely mention the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="004390_0130_100D7BAD5B33D248"/>
It is certainly (if not impossible) one of the most difficult Things in the World, when we have laid down a Sign of Grace, to invalidate the Clain of Self-Deceivers, without overthrowing the Comfort of some weak, doubting, tempted Christian: Or to answer the Scruples of these, and not imbolden those Pretenders. The gra∣cious Soul has an abiding Sense of his own Vile∣ness; The unsound Heart may be ready also, at all Times, to consess that he is a vile Sinner. Where now lies the Difference? It may be disi∣covered by this Effect in the Upright, which the Unconverted never reach to; even to justisy God, though he should shut out all Prayers, re∣ject all Services; and out of our own Mouths condemn us to the Pit of Hell, when we consess ourselves to be guilty of Death; <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.10. <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.41, 42.2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.26. <HI>compar'd with Isa.</HI> 58.3. And then with respect to the latter Part of the Mark: Many a Gospel-Sinner, af∣ter great, but common Convictions of his many and great Sins, and aster he has made Trial, and finds that he cannot work himself out of his present wretched State, nor into God's Favour, may, from the doctrinal Knowledge he has of the only Way of Salvation by Christ, and the Spirit's Operation on his Affections as well as Under∣standing, really desire Christ to be his Saviour, not only from Hell but Sin; the Guilt of all, and the Dominion of most Sins: But he does not desire Christ as a suitable and satisfying Portion for his Soul, both for Time and to Eternity: He has no inward Principle of Love to Christ; never any Love-sick Sighs for his Abesence, or
<PB N="126" REF="004390_0131_100D7BAEED670430"/>amorous Descriptions of him, breathings after him, delight in his Person, and solace in his Company; like those we find the Spouse fami∣liarly acquainted with, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.2, 3, 4, 7, 13, 16. &amp; 25, 6, &amp; 3.1,—4. &amp; 4.16. &amp; 5.4,—8, 10, <HI>to the end.</HI> &amp; 8.6, 7. To such as believe (and none else) Christ is precious, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7. The sanctified Judgment does deliberately and constantly esteem him above all Things; and the Affections of the renewed Soul, when the Question is asked, What is the most desirable Thing in the World? Do readily answer, <HI>None but Christ.</HI> Now, though many christless Souls will indeavour to perswade themselves that they have this Sign of Grace, yet surely they do not feel such workings of Heart towards <HI>Sweet Jesus</HI> as thou that fearest it is too good News, to be true: thou feelest,—but what shall I say? it's much better felt than exprest.</P>

<HEAD>USE III. For EXHORTATION, in several Branches.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Branch I.</HI> To such as, upon a fair Trial, are Cast and Self-Condemned: (And if our own Heart condemn us, God is greater than our Heart, and knows all Things, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.20.) Suffer a Word of Exhortation: And now, let it be your great Care to lay a good Foundation; and see that you build firm and sure for the Time to come. And to this End;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Cease not, Day and Night, to cry unto the Lord, that he would be pleased to send the
<PB N="127" REF="004390_0132_100D7C6FE5117C98"/>Spirit of Truth to convince you of Righteous∣ness as well as Sin, <HI>John</HI> 16.8. There can be no sound Conversion without a thorough Con∣viction: This is the Work of the Spirit, in the Day of God's Power. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19, 20. What is the exceeding Greatness of his Power to us∣ward who believe; according to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the Dead, and sat him at his own Right Hand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now in this powerful Work, the Sinner is convinced of Righteousness in Christ for him, as well as of Sin and Unbelief in himself. The Spirit of Il∣lumination shows us, how that Christ was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righte∣ousness of God in him. He was delivered for our Offences, and raised again for our Justifi∣cation. And being condemned as our Surety, he could never have risen and ascended to the Father, had not the Law and first Covenant been fulfilled [by this Second <HI>Adam,</HI> divine Justice satisfied, and infinite Wrath appeased: Therefore is the Spirit said, by our Surety, to convince of Righteousness, because he went to the Father; and was not sent back again, which he must have been if he had not made an end of Sin, and brought in everlasting Righteousness. When a Surety becomes Bound for the Princi∣pal Debtor, he cannot be discharged, till the Debt is paid. Till the Self-condemned Sinner sees this, he cannot believe. Plead then that Promise, Prov. 1.23. <HI>Turn you at my Reproof: behold I will pour out my Spirit, and make known my Words unto you.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="128" REF="004390_0133_100D7C72532A5770"/>
(2) You must know that you can do nothing acceptably, till you have believed in Christ;t; and the Spirit does not work Faith, till he has first prepared the Soul by a Work of Humiliti∣on. You were exhorted and directed in the first Place to pray for the Spirit; and God has pro∣mised to give his Holy Spirit to his Children, when they ask him: But now, an unconverted Man can't pray in Faith, and therefore can't pray acceptably; for without Faith it's impossible to please God: Yet, for them to neglect Pray∣er, will provoke him; and it's a double Sin. The Unbeliever sins in praying, because he prays not aright; but he that omits Prayer, is guilty of the same sinful Defect, in the want of a right Frame of Heart to pray; and then he omits a commanded Duty, (even <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was bid to pray) and so is doubly guilty. Pray you must, as well as you can; till you have obtained an Heart to pray better: But you must see that your every Prayers now, as well as your Omission of Prayer heretofore, afford Matter of Shame and Humilitation; and so they are of great Use, as well as on account of the Sinner's lying more in the Way of the Spirit while he is praying, than while sleeping in Security, on the Bed of Sloth, or running away from God, after Plea∣sures, Profits and Honours of the World; or else, through fearful Despair. And thou shalt find, if God Intends good to thy Soul, that Ex∣tremity shall force thee to pray; or if it be some∣times so great, as to stop thy Mouth, thou shalt sight and groan for an Heart to pray. And, tho' it be sometimes long first, yet thou shalt be made
<PB N="129" REF="004390_0134_100D7C744D9CB5F0"/>willing to justify God, though he shut out thy Prayers now, and thrust thee out for ever: (as in the Text) yea, and shut thee up, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth. Thus, thou shalt be shut up to the Faith, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.23. All other Refuge now fails; the convinced Sin∣ner has no thir Way to take; he must come to Christ for Life, and believe in him that justi∣fies the Ungodly, or despair and die; and yet, believe, he finds, he cannot, till he feel the ir∣resistable, but sweet Drawings of the Father; and then he can't but believe, John 6.44, 45. <HI>NO Man can come to me, except the Father draw him. Every Man that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> And these Things are needful to be known, in order to the laying a sure Foundation at last; that the once de∣ceived Soul stumble not again at the same Stone, and fall irrecoverably, by self-righteous Perfor∣mances, and false Hopes built thereon, for want of the saving Knowledge of Jesus Christ,</P>
<P N="3">(3) In a Word, YOu must deny your natu∣ral, civil, sinful and righteous Self; and accept of Christ as your Prophet, Priest and King, on the Terms of the Gospel. As your Prophet, to enlighten your dark Minds in the Knowledge of his Father and himself; <HI>(No Man knows the Fa∣ther but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him;)</HI> whom to know is Life eternal. There is a notional, historical Knowledge, which you may learn by Books and Study; by minis∣terial and parental Instruction, Christian Con∣ference and Discourse: But you must look to him who was given for a Light to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="004390_0135_100D7C75E3607520"/>to teach you the saving and experimental Know∣ledge of the supernatural Mysteries of Faith and Regeneration: John 3.8, 9. <HI>The Wind blows where it listeth, and thou hearest the Sound thereof; but canst not tell whence it comes, and whither it goes; so is every one that is born of the Spirit. Ni∣codemus saith unto him, how can these Things be?</HI> Yea, thou must be willing to become a Fool, (tho' thou wert a Master in <HI>Israel</HI>) that thou may'st be wise unto Salvation, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. You must also receive Christ as your Priest and King; that he may, of God, be made unto you, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption, as well as Wisdom. He that is not willing to be holy in Heart, Lip and Life, and all Manner of Conversation, can't be happy. Christ will save none, but such as are willing he shoul rule over them. Yea, thou must deny thyself, and take up thy Cross and follow him; or thou canst not be his Disciple. Self-Denial is indeed, the hardest of all Lessons; but 'tis a necessary one; 'tis an hard Lesson! but 'tis not impossible to be learn'd, it may be larn'd, andit must be learn'd; and thou shalt learn by Experience, that it's both sweet and above all Things profi∣table, to be all thy Life Time studying Self∣Denial, and practising Self-Denial; <HI>i.e.</HI> to live and act from Day to Day, quite contrary to the strong Bent of thy corrupt Heart, Thus much for the first Branch of the Exhortation.</P>
<P><HI>Branch</HI> II. The second Branch of this Use, is to such as having impartially examined them∣selves, by the ten forementioned marks of a good Estate, or by any other infallible, Scripture
<PB N="131" REF="004390_0136_100D7C7C117EC668"/>Sign of Grace, do find ground of Confidence to∣wards God; according to that of the Apostle, 1 John 3.21. <HI>Beloved; If our Heart condemn us not, then have we Confidence towards God.</HI> The Word of this Exhortation is to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. That you lift up your Hearts and humbly bless the Lord.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It is he that has converted thee. Thou couldst never have changed thy own Heart, any more than an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> can change his Skin, or a <HI>Leopard</HI> his Spots, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.23. Ministers are but poor weak Instruments in God's Hand: <HI>Who then is</HI> Paul <HI>and who is</HI> Apollos; <HI>but Ministers by whom ye believed; even as the Lord gave to every Man? I have planted,</HI> Apollos <HI>watered; but God gave the Increase. So then, neither is be that planteth any Thing, nor be that watereth; but GOD that giveth the Increase.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) Conversion is not only a Mercy, a free Mercy, (all Mercies are so) but 'tis a necessary Mercy; more necessary than Bread or Breath. If the Lord should not have given thee this Mer∣cy, other Mercies would but have sunk thee the deeper into Hell. Moreover, it is a great, a rich, a comprehensive Merch: There's a free, full and final Pardon of all thySins contained in it; exceeding great and precious Promises annexed to it; yea, eternal Glory infallibly consequent upon it. And then, 'tis a distinguishing Mercy. Not one Quarter of the World have any Means of Grace; and scarce a Quarter Part of them that hear the Word, receive the Truth in the Love of it; and bring forth Fruit with Patience.

<P N="2">2 Pity and pray for others that are uncon∣verted. You compassionate the Case of the Sick and wounded; and pray, oft and earnestly, for the Redemption of poor Captives: But all these sad Circumstances, meet together in many of your Neighbours; and some of the same Hous∣hold, or Blood with you. They are carried Captive by Satan, and bound with the Cords of Sin: They are mortally sick, and bleeding to Death; their Souls are wounded, and they are bleeding to eternal Death!

<P><HI>Branch</HI> III. The next Branch of this Use is to a thrid sort of Persons who are utterly at a Loss what to judge of their spiritual State. Self-Examination is a Work that requires Time and Pains, Care and Skill; now, partly thro' Weak∣ness and Darkness, partly thro' Negligence and Slothfulness, these Persons are at a great Uncer∣tainty, and know not what to think of their pre∣sent Condition. Sometimes they are perswarded all is well with them; otherwhile they are of a quite contrary Opinion concerning themselves: And thus they live in an unsafe as well as un∣comfortable Life, between Hope and Fear. Now these are of two Sorts.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Some are indeed unsound at Heart; built on a legal Foundation; formal Hypocrites: (As for gross Hypocrites, they are not solicitous a∣bout the Matter; if they can but pass for Saints, that's as much as they care for;) These Le∣galists have pleased themselves with Hopes of escaping the Wrath to come; and of going to Heaven when they die. Either they have ne∣ver been grosly and visibly bad; or else they have been awakned and reformed. They not only profess but practice Religion, in Church, Family and Closet: Many take them for good Christians; and none can charge them with gross Immorality; and they would sain think them∣selves right and safe: but they can't stand be∣fore close and home Preaching. The Spirit of
<PB N="134" REF="004390_0139_100D7C846BA1B550"/>Truth sometimes in a searching Sermon, does even wrest from them their false Hopes; and they are almost perswaded that all is not right with them; that another Manner of Work must pass upon them, or they perish for ever. Their Works seem to be good; but their Ends are not so: Now, <HI>The Word of God is quick and power∣ful; sharper than any two-edged Sword; piercing to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit; and of Joynts and Marrow; and is a Discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,</HI> Heb. 4.12. Though their Intent of Heart may not be to de∣ceive Men, with fair, outside Shows; yet, their inward Thought is, that they shall ingratiate themselves with God, by their good Meanings and well Doing.
<P>Fatso Signs of Grace they truly have; and true ones they sometimes, faisly conclude they have: But, by the Light of the Word, and their own Consciences, they are often condemned; yet they bring not the Matter to a Conclusion: Loth they are to raize all to the very Founda∣tion; and rip up that too; it's too much Cost and Pains for them to build all a new: If they should go about it, they know not how nor where to lay the first Stone, in this supernatural Building. This is the very Case of some.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Others are precious Saints of God, and humble Followers of the meek and holy Jesus: They are poor in Spirit, and as low in Comforts, and full of jealous Fears: Their Grace is weak, and their Temptations strong; they hardly know how to go about the Work of Self-trying; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are always apt to suspect the worst of them∣selves:
<PB N="135" REF="004390_0140_100D7C8826B40CF0"/>They are as ready to admit every Thing that seems to be against them, as the former Sort are to catch at any Shadow fo Comfort: Or else they may probably be in a declining State; they have possibly been, for some Time, di∣verted thro' the subtit Wiles of the Devil, the ensnaring Temptations of the World, and the consederate Party of traiterous Lusts within, from the Ways of Piety and Purity; Circum∣spection and tenderness of Conscience; Integri∣ty of Heart and Fervency of Spirit in serving the Lord: Perhaps they have given too much Liberty to the Flesh, while Duties and Means of Communion with God: And then, no wonder if they are at a Loss what to judge of their State. The Foundation of God, indeed, stands sure, having this Seal, The Lord knows who are his: But as for themselves, they cannot say, <HI>We know we are passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren;</HI> or by any other infallible Mark: For, tho' they sometimes sensibly feel the Workings of this or other gracious Affections and Desires; yet, they are conscious of many Things, in and by themselves, which seem in∣consistent with the Truth of Grace. If they have one Sign for them, they have two, as they think, against them; as the other Sort, though they have many plain Signs against them, yet they have some, that they mistake to be for them. The one hopes he may escape; the other fears he shall miscarry. They both, as I said, live between Hope and Fear; and know not, for the most Part, what to make of themselves: They
<PB N="136" REF="004390_0141_100D7C89A9392578"/>have tried, and try'd again; look'd into their Hearts, and then up to Heaven; while the Word and Rules of Trial have been before their Eyes, sounding in their Ears, or in their Tho'rs; but they can bring nothing to an Issue: Their present and eternal State remains dubious: They are unresolved after all. If this be thy Case, Reader, then this Branch of the Exhortation is to thee.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I suppose thee not only to have read over the fore going Use; but that thou hast compared thy Heart and Life with the Marks therein given, according to the Directions preceeding those Marks; or, after thou shalt have so done, sup∣posing thee still to remain in the Dark about thy Estate; then, go to some able, experienced Chris∣tian or Minister, and open thy Case to him: Give him the Reasons of thy Hopes at some∣times, and tell him the Grounds of thy Fears, that at other Times prevail over thy Hopes. Let him know how thou first camest by thy Hope; for this is a main Question that such an one as I am directing thee unto will ask, ac∣cording to that of the Apostle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> Chap. 3. ver. 2. <HI>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the Hearing of Faith?</HI> Above all, be sure to deal faithfully with such a Messenger; an Inter∣preter, as he is called, (<HI>Job</HI> 33.23.) One among a Thousand, to shew unto Man his Uprightness: Yea, beg of the Lord to help thee, by his good Spirit, in opening thy Case; that thou mayest make it neither better nor worse than it really is: If, after all, thou shouldest continue as much
<PB N="137" REF="004390_0142_100D7C8B2B39A898"/>perplexed in thy Mind as before; and findest Reason, as far as thou canst judge, to question whether ever thou didst believe in Christ; then believe in him now, either for the first Time, or renew thy Faith in him for Justification. It's not necessary that thou shouldest know certainly whether ever thou didst receive Christ heretofore or no; if now thou art willing to receive him, that thou mayest be sanctified as well as justified and saved, he is thine: A Will to come to Christ, is coming to him; and him that cometh unto him, he will in no wise cast out, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.37. By him all that believe are justified from all Things, <HI>Act.</HI> 13.39. As many as receive him become the Sons of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. I know thou hast not Power to believe in Christ; nor does God require thee to do it in thy own Strength; any more than he expected <HI>Moses</HI> should make a dry Path through the Red-Sea, when he commands him expresly to divide it, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.16. Yet he could lift up his Rod, and stretch it out over the Sea; and upon his doing so, we read, (ver. 21. last Clause) <HI>that the Waters were divided.</HI> So, God commands thee to believe in Christ; and thou, under a Sense, both of thy extream Unworthiness and utter Weakness, de∣pending on Almighty Power, dost, in the Strength of God, accept his offered Grace in Christ: Does not thy whole Soul now, say, Lord, I accept. Then as thou hast received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk thou in him, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.6</P>
<P><HI>Branch</HI> IV. To conclude this Use; let me ex∣hort one and all, in the Name and Words of our Lord in the Context, ver. 24. <HI>Strive to enter
<PB N="138" REF="004390_0143_100D7C8CCC342540"/>in at the strait Gait: For many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</HI> There is a close Connection (if not in the Contexture of the Chapter, yet in the Nature of the Things) between this earnest Exhortation, and the solemn Words of the Text: <HI>There shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth, when ye shall see</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>in the Kingdom of God, and you your∣selves thrust out:</HI> Oh! therefore <HI>strive to enter in,</HI> &amp;c. And to excite you to utmost Diligence, even unto Violence, (for, <HI>the Kingdom of Hea∣ven suffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force;</HI>) Consider a few Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You have here a sufficient Warrant to strive. There be some Things that we are na∣turally desirous to do and obtain, which are not lawful for us to do or desire: But to get to Heaven, we may strive lawfully: Now this is a great Thing! To aspire after an earthly Kingdom, would be Sin and Folly in our Thoughts; but it would be Treason to do it in Words and Actions. Yet may we very warrantably, desire to wear a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away: Yea, 'tis a damning Sin, not to desire to glorify God, and enjoy him in his Kingdom for ever. And what a Wonder of Mercy; what a Miracle of condescending Love is this, to the Children of Disobedience and Wrath; that he who sits at the right Hand of the Majesty on high, should bid us strive to en∣ter in! <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet, such is our natural Infidelity, and Ill-Will towards this sweet, compassionate Saviour; and such the slanderous Insinuations of the Devil, to discourage all Endeavours, that
<PB N="139" REF="004390_0144_100D7C8F51C95C28"/>we are ready to suspect him, whose Name is faithful and true, of Hypocrisy; as if he stood and held the Door against us to keep us out, while he calls and cries, and intreats as well as commands that we enter in. But 'tis a most un∣reasonable and blasphemous Jealousy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. And probable ground of Hope, will induce and engage Men to strive for the Things that are seen and temporal: Yea, a bare Possibility of obtaining, in case of Life and Death will do it. And shall not the Hope of obtaining the Things that are not seen and are eternal, excite utmost Endeavours, in the use of appointed Means? The Husbandman labours and sweats in Hope and hath long Patience, <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.7. The Mer∣chant lays out a considerable Estare in Building, and then ventures, perhaps, more than he is worth, between the unstable Waters and incon∣stant Winds, in the midst of Rocks, and Shoals, and Robbers, in Hope of a rich Return. The hardy, valiant Soldier rushes into the midst of a thousand Deaths, to win a little fading Honour; and it may be loses his End, and ends his Life in the Attempt. And shall we not strive to en∣ter in at the strait Gate?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. This is the very Road Way to Heaven, in which <HI>Sion's</HI> Pilgrims have, in all Ages, tra∣velled to that celestial City; though it be rough, and sometimes dark; over Mountains, and thro' a Wilderness. (Read the <HI>eleventh to the Hebrews,</HI> and see if it be not so) <HI>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a Cloud of Wit∣nesses, let us lay aside every Weight and the Sin which doth so easily beset us, and les us run with
<PB N="140" REF="004390_0145_100D7C9461BE7D20"/>Patience the Race that is set before us,</HI> Chap. 12 1. Are we better than <HI>Enoch and Elijah; Moses</HI> and <HI>Samuel; Noah, Daniel</HI> and <HI>Joh; Ahraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob; Paul</HI> and the beloved Desciple; and all the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles, and Armies of Believers? That we should not be willing to work out our own Salvation with laborious Diligence and Solicitude; that we should once think to get the Victory, and win the Prize, without running, wrestling, fighting and striving! Yea, CHRIST himself work'd hard all Day, <HI>Joh.</HI> 9.4. He first suffered, and then entred into his Glory, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.26. And must we have a new and easy Way laid out for us? No, never dream of going to Heaven on a Feather-Bed; Heb. 6.12. <HI>That ye be not sloth∣ful; but Followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It may be you have taken a great deal of Pains already, and suffered much: Now, will you lose all for want of taking a little more; and lose your Hopes and lose your Souls into the Bargain? Gal. 3.4 <HI>Have ye suffered so much in vain?</HI> It may be you have forsaken every false Way, save one only secret Lust, that you hide as a sweet Morsel under your Tongue. And, will you incur the World's Frowns because you go so far; and yet lose the Favour of God be∣cause you go no further? Gal. 3.3, 4. <HI>Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the Flesh? Ye did run well, who did hinder you?</HI> Mat. 10.22. <HI>He that endures to the End shall be saved.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="141" REF="004390_0146_100D7C95FA482698"/>
5. When you are just ready to give out, then alsufficient Supplies of Strength may be near, e∣ven just at the Door. You have been labouring and striving, watching and praying, till you are wearied out and ready to faint: God seems to shut out your Prayer, when you cry and shout, <HI>Lam</HI> 3.8. And you are strongly tempted to say, with <HI>Saul,</HI> Why should I wait any longer on one who answers me not; either by Read∣ing, or by Hearing, or by Prayer? The Temp∣ter presses sore upon thee, to cast off Duty; to give Way to Sin: Now, if thou canst hold out a little longer, Satan's Hour (for he is limited to a certain Time in all his Temptations) will be run out; and God, who is trying of thee, will help speedily: Deut. 32.36. <HI>For the Lord shall judge his People, and repent himself for his Servants, when there is none shut up or left, and he seeth that their Power is gone.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Oject.</HI> We are indeed bid to strive to enter in: But are we not told, in the same Breath, that the Gate is strait, and many shall seek to enter in, and not be able: This discourageth us from striving: It's impossible we should obtain.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> (1.) Such as do much in Religion miss of obtaining, not because Salvation is unattain∣able by them; but for want of doing more, and going further, and holding out: Jer. 29.13, 14. <HI>And ye shall seek me and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your Heart: And I will be found of you, saith the Lord. Then shall ye know if we follow on to know the Lord,</HI> Hos. 6.3. <HI>He that endures to the End shall be saved.</HI> When <HI>Agrippa</HI> said to <HI>Paul, Almost thou perswadest me to be a
<PB N="142" REF="004390_0147_100D7C978960E8D0"/>Christian,</HI> you know what the Apostle's Reply was, Act. 26.28, 29. <HI>I would to God, that not only thou, but all that hear me this Day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these Bonds.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) Conversion and Salvation, Grace and Glory, our entring in at the strait Gate, and walking in the narrow Way; as it is possible, so is it of absolute Necessity. We may all say with respect to the working out our Salvation, and making our Calling and Election sure, as <HI>Paul</HI> says concerning the Work of his Office; Necessity is laid upon us; wo unto us if we do it not. So that there is no room to enquire, whether it be hard or easy, before we determine to set about it, seeing it must be done; unless you are resol∣ved to try whether there be any dwelling with devouring Fire; whether the torrid Zone of everlasting Burnings be habitable?</P>
<P N="3">(3) That far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, is as well worth the most that can possibly be done as the least. All the La∣bours and Sorrow, Self-denial and Sufferings, of the present Life, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that shall be revealed. One that had been in the third Heavens, and suffer∣ed more than most on Earth, did reckon so. <HI>Enoch</HI> walked with God, some Hundreds of Years: And what says <HI>Heman? I am afflicted and ready to die, from my Youth up: while I suf∣fer thy Terrors, I am distracted,</HI> Psal. 88.15. Yet they had both a good Bargain; though it was after long Waiting, and through much Tri∣bulation, that they entred into the Kingdom of
<PB N="143" REF="004390_0148_100D7C9CD194EA60"/>God. Yea, the more industrious a Christian is in well-Doing, and the more he suffers for it, the greater will be his Reward in Heaven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11, 12.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) It is Discouragement and faint-Hearted-ness, that in all Cases, make easy Things hand, and Difficulties insuperable; whereas, Boldness and fixed Resolution of Mind, will make hard Things easy: And indeed all Things are possible to him, that in Hope, believes against Hope. If all the <HI>Israelites</HI> had been of <HI>Caleb</HI>'s Spirit; Numb. 13.30. who said, <HI>Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it:</HI> Six hundred thousand Lives, besides forty Years sore Travel had been spared: Whereas the dis∣couraging Report of the faint hearted Spies, of tall Men and high Walls, kept that numerous Congregation from entring <HI>Canaan,</HI> a Type of Heaven, when they were just at its Borders.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) In a Word, our blessed Saviour does out of real good Will towards Men, and in very Faithfulness let us know, that the Gate of Life and Way to Heaven is strait and narrow, and few there be that find it; many shall seek to enter in and not be able, that we might strive the more earnestly, and not be diverted and beaten back by the Oppositions we shall be sure to meet in the Way; but remember how plainly Christ dealt with us; Joh. 16.1, 4. <HI>These Things have I spoken unto you, that you should not be offended. But these Things I have told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</HI> It's no Matter through how much Tri∣bulation it be, since if we are willing, we shall
<PB N="144" REF="004390_0149_100D7C9F87A64468"/>enter into the the Kingdom of God; <HI>Act.</HI> 14.22. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.12. <HI>Rev.</HI> 7.14. <HI>compared.</HI></P>
<P>I will just hint at some Things, for our Di∣rection and further Help in this great and diffi∣cult Work; and so pass on to another Use.</P>
<P>First, We must know that Conversion is taken either actively or passively. Sometimes we are commanded to convert ourselves, and turn from Sin to God; to repent and be converted, that our Sins may be blotted out; to make us a new Heart and a new Spirit, casting away all our Transgressions, lest we die; and it is our unques∣tionable Duty to cease to do Evil, and learn to do well; yet, these Injunctions do not suppose that it is in our Power to change our own Hearts: the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> may as soon change his Skin: They express our Duty, and convict us of Guilt in our Non-performance, and bring us to our Knees, as <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. 31.18, 19. <HI>I have surely heard</HI> Ephraim <HI>bemoaning himself,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned. Surely, after that I was turned I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my Thigh; I was ashamed, yea even confounded,</HI> &amp;c. We are wholly passive, when the Spirit of God takes away the Heart of Stone, and gives us an Heart of Flesh; as you may see more at large, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25, to 33. If Christ were not exalted to give Repentance as well as Pardon, how great a Prince soever he might be esteemed, he would be but an imperfect Saviour, Act. 5.31. <HI>You hath be quickned</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>who were dead in Trespasses and Sins:</HI> Yea, he doubles it over again; <HI>Even when we were dead in Sins, hath be quickned us</HI> Eph. 2.1, 5. 'Tis
<PB N="145" REF="004390_0150_100D7CA10B9485F8"/>certain you must turn or die; be converted or damned: 'Tis no less true, that you cannot convert yourselves: Cry to Heaven then, as <HI>Ephraim</HI> above mentioned, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18, 19.</P>
<P>Secondly, Keep we our Eye on the Things that are not seen and are eternal; 2 Cor. 4.16, 18. <HI>We faint not,—while we look not at the Things which are seen; but at the Things which are not seen: for the Things which are seen are tem∣poral, but the Things which are not seen, are eter∣nal.</HI> This Respect to the Recompence of Re∣ward, will make us chuse rather to suffer Afflic∣tion with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a Season, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.25. and then to suffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire, <HI>Jude</HI> 7.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Minding still our present Work from Day to Day; not perplexing ourselves with what is future, so as to bring the Burden of many Days Work into one; yea it may be of a Life of Labour and Suffering, in a long Course of active and passive Obedience, on our weak Shoulders all at once: This is the Way to do nothing: <HI>Sufficient to the Day is the</HI> (Labour and) <HI>Evil thereof.</HI> To-morrow will bring new Strength as well as Work: <HI>For God is able to make all Grace abound towards you; that ye always having All-sufficiency, in all Things, may abound to every good Work,</HI> 2 Cor. 9.8. Mind we then our pre∣sent Work and Duty.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Yet we must sit down and count the Cost; <HI>Luke</HI> 14.28, 33. Lest we prove like the Stony-Ground Hearers, <HI>Who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with Joy, and
<PB N="146" REF="004390_0151_100D7CA2B7F6D7E0"/>having no Root in themselves, endure but for a Time: Afterward when Affliction or Persecution criseth for the Word's sake, immediately they are ossended.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, Above all look we to Jesus, the Au∣thor and Finisher of our Faith; (<HI>Heb.</HI> 12.2.) as our great Prophet and Teacher; our High Priest, that has died to appease God's Anger, and lives to proeure his Favour for us; as our royal Master, to rule our Hearts entirely, and our whole Lives. And look we thus to him;
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) When we engage in any Duty; through whose <HI>Strength we can do all Things,</HI> Phil. 4.13. But <HI>without him we can do no nothing,</HI> Joh. 15.5.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) When we come off from Duty; for we are accepted only in the Beloved, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.6. And may well say, the Sin of this Duty would damn me, if it were not for Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) To manage the whole Business of our Salvation, when we are not, as well as when we are actually engaged in religious Duties: <HI>He is able to save to the uttermost,—seeing he ever lives to make Intercession for us,</HI> Heb. 7.25.</ITEM>

To Church-Members, (as we commonly distinguish) Communicants, or such as are in full Communion; not to rest in a liteless Name, or the highest visible Relation, and external Cove∣nant-Priviledges.

What are we, poor Dunghil-Worms, the best of us all, that we should be re∣lated to the Crown of Heaven, and brought into the Banquet of Wine, prepared for the Bride and the Lamb's Wife; where the King himself, (whose Reign extends further than from <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> even to both Hemispheres, and all Creatures, visible and invisible: This glorious King) fits at the Table with his Guests; and walks in the midst of the Golden Candle∣sticks: But, let him that hath an Ear to hear, hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches: Rev. 2.4 <HI>Thou bast left thy first Love.</HI> Ver. 23. <HI>All the Churches shall know that I am be which searcheth the Reins and Hearts: And I will give unto every one of you according to your Works.</HI> Chap. 3.1. <HI>I know thy Works; that thou hast a Name that thou livest, and art dead.</HI> Ver. 4. <HI>Thou hast a few Names, even in Sardis.</HI> Ver. 4. <HI>Thou hast a few Names, even in Sardis.</HI> Ver. 15, 16, 17. <HI>I know thy Works; that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot: So then, because thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my Mouth: Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with Goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches,</HI> ver. 22.

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Some may be ready to say, Why are we received into your Communion; seeing we are like to be thrust out at last? You threaten us if we don't remember Christ and his dying Love, and shew forth his Death in the Lord's Sup∣per; — and we can have no Quiet when all is done.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. We invite you to the marriage Feast; but we advise you, withal, to put on the Wed∣ding Garment. We never told you that Pray∣ing, Hearing, Receiving would save you, with∣out repeating and believing the Gospel; and
<PB N="149" REF="004390_0154_100D7CACE35EEA98"/>mortifying your darling Lusts; and denying your idolized Self-Righteousness; and living upon Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. We multiply Cautions, because we have Reason to fear you are not all right and sound; though we dare not judge any in particular; for, though Love causes Jealousy towards some; yet Charity hopes all Things. Some that we little suspect, may deceive themselves and us; and in others there may be found some good Grains of Wheat among the Chaff, when the Church-Floor shall be thoroughly purged, (not only from Hypocrites; but from the great Re∣mains of Hypocrisy in some that are sincere) although we can't but fear the worst.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we have been deceived in you, and you have been so in yourselves, hitherto, yet your Case is not desperate. To eat unworthily at the Lord's-Table is not the Sin against the Holy Ghost. The Blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> which we are, in this Case, guilty of prophaning, can cleanse us from this heinous Sin, as well as it did some of those who spilt it, <HI>John</HI> 1.7. That which we are caution'd against is leaning on Means, Duties and Priviledges, instead of leaning upon the Lord; and leaning upon the Lord, while we hate to be reformed; or spare some BosomSin; because we love it more than Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. To Non-Communicants; such as come to hear the Word, and have generally received one Seal of the Covenant, either in their Infancy, or else have solemnly covenanted with God, and received the Seal of Baptism at adult Age; and many also of the Seed of the Faithful, that have
<PB N="150" REF="004390_0155_100D7CAF82CD21F0"/>renewed their Baptismal Covenant, and publick∣ly avouched the Lord to be their God, in order to the Sealing of their Offspring; but yet turn their Backs on the Table of our Lord and theirs: The other Branch of this Use of <HI>Caution</HI> is to you: Think not, do not dream, let it never enter into your Hearts that you shall come off the better because you make not so high a Pro∣fession as others do. I might appeal to your own Consciences, whether you are not some∣times drawn away by such Temptations as these, — We are no Church-Members; nor so strictly tied up, but that we may take a little Liberty in our Communication, Way and Walk: We shall not be so narrowly watched over: If we come not under the Lash of the Law we shall do well enough: Neither does the Lord require so much of us as of others: We hear and pray, and neither lie nor swear, steal or cheat; and, for ought we can see, we are as good as many of them; who are as hard in their Dealings as a∣ny; they will be in a Passion, talk vainly, and frequent Taverns some of them: <HI>(Wo to the World because of Offences!)</HI> And such as are more de∣mure and precise (it's like) are as bad as the rest; though they don't yet discover themselves. And what, do they think to engross all the Riches of Grace and Glory to themselves; as if none should go to Heaven but Church-Members? Such carnal Reasonings as these, are the inward Thoughts of very many natural Men; whereby Satan lulls their Consciences asleep in Security; and they dream of escaping Vengeance, when Christ
<PB N="151" REF="004390_0156_100D7CB1225AAD80"/>shall come in flaming Fire; tho' they live in Disobedience to his Gospel, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.7, 8, 9.</P>
<P>But, Oh! Be not deceived; beware, beware, lest your Adversary the Devil, and (a worse Enemy) your own Heart flatter you to your own Undoing.</P>
<P>For, Consider,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) If you made no Profession at all, and had not so much as the Name of Christ called upon you in Baptism; yet, coming to the House of God, and hearing of your Sin and Danger, of your Duty and Interest, from Time to Time; and having the Things of your everlasting Peace pressed on you, in the Name and Authority of him who will shortly judge us and you; How can you hope to escape aggravated Condemna∣tion, if you neglect so great Salvation? Heb. 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>Therefore we ought to give the more ear∣nest heed to the Things that we have heard,</HI>— If you had but once, in all your Life, had Christ made known to you, and the Way of Salvation thro' him, your rejecting Gospel Grace, freely offered, would have made your Case, in the Day of Judgment, worse than that of the Heathen, who perish for lack of Vision, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.18. But,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) You profess enough to leave you worse than without Excuse; (for so the Light of Na∣ture, and Works of Creation will leave the Pagan World, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20.) enough to condemn all your Omissions and Commissions, with a Con∣demnation sorely aggravated. Besides the Know∣ledge of God's Will, (which on that Score, if you obey it not, you shall be beaten with many
<PB N="152" REF="004390_0157_100D7CB4798AC238"/>Stripes, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.47.) you were bound out, from your Infancy, to Service with the same Master that Church-Members are bound to: And from these Bonds of the Covenant you cannot disen∣gage yourselves: If you break them, you for∣feit all the Blessings of the same Covenant: As an Heir, come to Age, may forfeit a great Estate, by refusing or neglecting to perform the small Conditions of a Deed, to which he was bound by his Father, without his own Consent. But by your own Consent, you are, the most of you, under the Bond of the Covenant; the Vows of God are upon you, to perform sincere, univer∣sal, and constant Obedience: Mat. 28.19, 20. <HI>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, &amp;c. Teaching them to observe all Things, whatsoever I have commanded you.</HI> What can Church-Mem∣bers be bound to more? Yea, yourselves are Church-Members; and there is no Duty of the Moral Law, or of the Gospel, but what you are bound to, as well, if not so strongly and so many Ways as they are. You are bound to for∣sake all Sin, as well as any other Church-Mem∣bers; and on the same Penalty. <HI>If ye live after the Flesh ye shall die.</HI> And ye have bound your∣selves to all this; so that I may say to you as <HI>Joshua</HI> to them, Josh. 24.21,—26. <HI>And the People said unto</HI> Joshua, <HI>Nay, but we will serve the Lord. And</HI> Joshua <HI>said to the People, Ye are Witnesses against yourselves, that you have chosen you the Lord to serve him. And they said, We are Witnesses. So</HI> Joshua <HI>made a Covenant with the People that Day;—and wrote these Words in the Book of the Law of God.</HI> In a waske Leave, at
<PB N="153" REF="004390_0158_100D7CB7495EF0E8"/>the End of this Book of God, we have a writ∣ten Covenant; in which you stand obliged, and firmly bound, by your own solemn Act and Deed, before God, Angels and Men, to walk in all manner of Conversation, as becomes the Gospel of Christ; as you hope to find Mercy in that Day. In which Baptismal and Church Co∣venant, you will find no such starting Hole as you pretend, that you make not such an high Profession as others; especially considering,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) That it is your Sin you profess no more, as well as that you practice so little according to what you do profess: <HI>With the Heart Man be∣lieves unto Righteousness, and with the Mouth Con∣fession is made unto Salvation,</HI> Rom. 10.10. Christ will be ashamed to own you, in the Day of Judgment, before Angels, if you are ashamed to own him now (in all his Ordinances) before Men. Have you once renewed Covenant? You should do it as oft as any of your Neigh∣bours do shew forth Christ's Death in the Lord's Supper. Do any of them profess better than they practice? However, they do well to pro∣fess; you should profess as well as they, and practice better. Whatever Excuses the invited Guests had for their not coming to the great Sup∣per, the Lord of the Feast was angry, and pro∣nounced a dieadful Sentence on them all. <HI>Luke</HI> 14.17,—24.</P>

<HEAD>USE V. For CONSOLATION.</HEAD>
<P>To all the spiritual Children of faithful <HI>Abra∣ham;</HI> in and with whom all Nations (even the Nations of them which are saved) are said to
<PB N="154" REF="004390_0159_100D7CBA4B9197F8"/>be blessed. If others shall see you in the King∣dom of God, and gnash their Teeth because themselves are excluded; then you shall find yourselves there, and have infinite Reason, on the contrary, to clap your Hands, to leap and shout for Joy: For <HI>you</HI> shall see <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and all the Prophets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Kingdom of God, and <HI>you</HI> yourselves receiv∣ed with them. Now, the Grounds of your pre∣sent Comfort and Rejoycing, in Hope of entring into and possessing that glorious Kingdom of God, are such as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first (and that without which all the rest would be but uncertain Grounds of Conso∣lation) is the inseparable Connection that there is between Faith and Salvation, Grace and Glo∣ry, Regeneration and Admission into the King∣dom of God: Now this Connexion is twofold, Negative and Affirmative; and so has a double Aspect.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) If we consider it Negatively, it is most certain, that without Faith and Holiness, or the New Birth, none can enter into the Kingdom of God, and be saved; Mark 16.16. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6 &amp; 12.14. Joh. 3.3. <HI>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a Man he born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</HI> And thus considered, it has a dreadful Aspect, not only on all the openly Profane, and secretly Wicked, and grosly Hypocritical; but on Self-righteous Formalists, and foolish Virgins; who live, and may die too, expecting to be re∣ceived: But they shall be thrust out. No Plea, on the Account of what they have been, and
<PB N="155" REF="004390_0160_100D7CBC08FF6010"/>done, and suffered, and parted with, will any Thing avail in that Day, if they have not let go their own Righteousness, and come naked to Christ to be cloathed with his. If this be thy Case, Rea∣der, thou hast no Part nor Lot in this Use of Con∣solation; turn back to the foregoing Uses; ex∣amine, repent, believe; for there is but one Law for all: If thou art found out of CHRIST, at the Judgment Seat, Omnipotency itself and infinite Mercy cannot save thee: Not through any Di∣ficiency in these Attributes; but the Inconsisten∣cy of your Salvation, in any other Way, with the Holiness, Justice, and Truth of GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) Now consider we the inseperable Con∣nexion between Conversion &amp; Salvation, Affirma∣tively; and it is as certain that he who now has the least Degree of justifying Faith shall be sav∣ed, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. If God has given thee true sanc∣tifying Grace, he will give thee Glory, <HI>Psal.</HI> 84.11.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This is evident,</P>
<P N="1">[1.] From Election, 1 Thes. 2.13. <HI>He hath from the Beginning chosen you to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth.</HI> The End you are chosen to is Salvation; the Way in which you shall infallibly come to that End is Faith and Holiness.</P>
<P>Object. 1. <HI>But what if I should turn back from the Lord, and turn again to Sin and die therein? Except I endure to the End I cannot be saved.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Then the Promises of God would fail: Jer. 32.40 <HI>I will put my Fear in their Hearts that they shall not depart from me.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.7, 8, 9. <HI>Our Lord Jesus Christ shall also confirm you to the End, that ye may be blameless in the Day of our Lord
<PB N="156" REF="004390_0161_100D7CC0B24FD260"/>Jesus Christ. God is faithful by whom ye are cal∣led.</HI> Phil. 1.6. <HI>Being confident of this very Thing, that he which bath begun a good Work in you will perform it until the Day of Jesus Christ.</HI> Joh. 4.14. <HI>The Water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of Water, springing up into everlasting Life.</HI></P>
<P>Object. 2. <HI>But don't we road of some that were turned away from the Faith?</HI> 1 Tim. 4.1. <HI>Some shall depart from the Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We know they had not the Faith of God's Elect, as true Faith is called, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.1. Be∣cause it is impossible that the Elect should be finally deceived; Mat. 24.24. <HI>For there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, insomuch that (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very Elect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[2.] The Intercession of CHRIST is another E∣vidence of the true Convert's certain Perseverance in Faith to Salvation; Luke 22.32. <HI>I have pray∣ed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</HI> Joh. 17.15. <HI>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the World, but that thou shouldest keep them from the Evil.</HI> Ver. 20. <HI>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe.</HI> Joh. 11.42 <HI>I know that thou hearest me always.</HI> Heb. 7.25. <HI>He is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God by him; seeing he ever lives to make Intercession for them.</HI> And because he (thus) lives, you shall live also, <HI>Joh</HI> 14.19.</P>
<P N="3">[3] In a Word; Some of the strongest Ob∣jections that are made against this Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance, are good Arguments for it. As now, what need of Cautions (say the Truth's Enemies) to prevent Apostacy, if there were no Possibility of falling away? Yea, rather,
<PB N="157" REF="004390_0162_100D7CC260ED3EB8"/>why should we doubt of the Saints Perseverance; seeing God has not only promised it, but has provided all Means (among which these Cautions are not the least) to bring it about. <HI>Take heed of Unbelief: Ye are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.5. I have given but brief Hints at some of the Scripture Grounds on which this first Ground of the Believer's Com∣fort is built: There is no Ground of Fear but God will bring him to Heaven; Luk. 12.32. <HI>Fear not little Flock; for it is your Father's good Plea∣sure to give you the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 It is the Kingdom of GOD. The very Name by which Heaven is here called, imports its transcendent Excellency. We read of the Kingdom of Men, <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.17. An earthly Crown of perishing Gold is the Top of worldly Excel∣lency; but what is this to a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for you? The Weakness of God is stronger than Men: The Wisdom of Men is Foolishness with GOD: The Kingdom of GOD is proportionably above all terrestial Kingdoms, in Riches, Honours and Pleasures; even durable Riches, manifold, abun∣dant Honours, and Pleasures for evermore: Psal. 16. ult. <HI>In thy Presence is fulness of Joy, and at thy right Hand there are Pleasures for evermore.</HI> The Kingdom of God on Earth is Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost. The Com∣forter does sometimes fill us with all Joy and Peace in believing: Believing ye rejoyce with Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory: What then will the Kingdom of God in Heaven be! If we rejoyce thus in Hope of the Glory of God; what
<PB N="158" REF="004390_0163_100D7CC42E68D818"/>shall the Joy of Fruition be? Something beyond what is unspeakable! He that can tell what in∣finite Power, Wisdom and Love can do; and what the Blood of God can purchase, may tell what Heaven is: that purchased Possession; that City, whose Builder and Maker is God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not Matter of sweet Consolation, to think what Company we shall have in Heaven? And that, whether we consider the Number and Quality, or the Manner of mutual Enjoyment.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> the City of the living God, the new and holy <HI>Jerusalem</HI> which is above, shall be full of excellent Inhabitants: We shall have Fellow-Citizens enough. An innumerable Com∣pany of Angels; and the whole General Assem∣bly, and Church of the First born, that are writ∣ten in Heaven; all being equal to Angels. We read of an Hundred and forty and four Thou∣sand of all the Tribes of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> with the Mark of God's Servants in their Fore∣heads: And afterwards of a great Multitude, which no Man could number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, standing before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloath∣ed with white Robes, and having Palms in their Hands; worshipping God with all the Angels, who also surround the same Throne, <HI>Rev</HI> 7.3,—11. Our Lord (in the Text) makes mention to the <HI>Jews</HI> only of <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the Prophets that were of their own Nation; yet, not excluding any of the Elect in that and all other Nations. Christ shall send his Angels, with a great Sound of a Trumpet; and they shall gather together his Elect, from the four Winds. <HI>Euro∣peans,
<PB N="159" REF="004390_0164_100D7CC919586F10"/>Affricans,</HI> and those of <HI>Asia</HI> shall be joined with us of <HI>America,</HI> in that great Congregation: And the <HI>Ethiopean</HI> shall then have a changed Skin; it shall be white and ruddy, surpasing the Beauty of Queen <HI>Esther</HI> and fair <HI>Absalom:</HI> Yea, all our vile Bodies shall be changed, and fashion∣ned like unto the glorious Body of Christ. But the Heart and Mind shall be adorned, enriched, and beautified (that's the shining, sparkling Beauty) with Wisdom and Grace. A Man's (imperfect) Wisdom makes his Face to shine: And the Holy are the Excellent of the Earth, in whom, notwithstanding their Spots, we have much Delight: How inconceivably delightsome, then, will the Society of Saints in Heaven be; who are without Spot, Wrinkle, or any such Thing? We find, here below, one (perhaps) amongst a Thousand, so excellently accomplish'd, well tem∣per'd, and full of Sweetness, that he is the Delight of Mankind: Yet such a Lilly among Thorns is but a Thorn in comparison of the Lillies of Para∣dise above. The least in the Kingdom of GOD will, doubtless, in gracious Loveliness of Dispo∣sition, and heavenly, charming Sweetness of Tem∣per, imcomparably surpass the most delightsome Companion that ever was born of a Woman. And then for Dignity, they shall be all Kings and Priests, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.6 And their Generosity and Greatness of Mind shall answer their Dignity: And in Wisdom as well as Honour, they shall be exalted as far above <HI>Solomon,</HI> as Heaven is higher than the Earth.</P>
<P>Concerning the Manner of their mutual Enjoy∣ment, we may say, it does not yet appear what it
<PB N="160" REF="004390_0165_100D7CCB6635BD00"/>shall be; but we know that when we shall be ga∣thered together unto Christ, at his Appearing and his Kingdom, it will be a joyful Meeting, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.19, 20. <HI>Chap.</HI> 4. <HI>from ver.</HI> 13. <HI>to the End of the Chapt. compar'd with</HI> 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.1. And to have everlasting Fellowship with Millions, whose Fel∣lowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, begun on Earth, by dark Views, thro' the Glass of Ordinances, shall be perfectly consummated by the beatifical Vision in Heaven. How delightsome will it be to see, and know, and walk, and talk, and with the greatest Freedom and Familiarity, to converse with <HI>Michael, Gabriel,</HI> and all the heavenly Host of shining Angels: With <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve; Abel, Enoch,</HI> and <HI>Elijah; Moses,</HI> and <HI>Sa∣muel; Noah, Daniel,</HI> and <HI>Job; Joseph,</HI> and <HI>Joshua; David</HI> and <HI>Solomon; Melchizedeck</HI> and <HI>Aaron;</HI> with all the rest of the holy Patriarchs and Prophets; Kings, Priests, &amp; other Old-Testament Believers; and the Apostles, Ministers and faithful Brethren of the New! There we shall see <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and <HI>John</HI> the beloved Desciple; <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Timothy; Joseph</HI> and <HI>Mary; Zacharias</HI> and <HI>Elisabeth;</HI> de∣vout <HI>Cornelius,</HI> charitable <HI>Dorcas,</HI> &amp; that dear <HI>Mary,</HI> that lovely Penitent, who washed her Saviour's Feet with her Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head; with all the many Thousands that were converted, and gathered into Churches by the Miracles and Ministry of Christ and his Apostles. We shall have an intimate Acquain∣tance with all that were beloved of God, faithful in Christ Jesus, and called to be Saints, both in <HI>Rome,</HI> and of the Church of God at <HI>Corinth;</HI> to∣gether with as many as were new Creatures in
<PB N="161" REF="004390_0166_100D7CCD19455C40"/>the Churches of <HI>Galatia;</HI> and enjoy sweet Com∣munion with the Saints, and faithful Brethren in Christ, which were at <HI>Ephesus, Philippi,</HI> and <HI>Colosse;</HI> for we shall be caught up together with them, and the elect <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> who were by the Power of the Gospel, turned from dumb Idols, to serve the living God; whose Faith in Christ grew while they lived, and, all dying in the Faith their Death was but a Sleep in Jesus. Now whether we live, and remain to the first Resurrection, or fall asleep in Christ, as they did, we shall (as I said) be caught up together with all the Elect that have gone be∣fore, and shall follow after us, to meet the Lord in the Air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord, and consequently with one another. And though it be the ineffable Vision and Fruition of GOD and the LAMB, in the Presence-Chamber of Glory, that makes Heaven to be Heaven, <HI>John</HI> 3.2. Yet, as the Blessedness of the Spirits of just Men made perfect is not consummate in their State of Seperation, tho' they see and enjoy the blessed God, as it will be after the Resurrection, because the Soul was created with an Inclination to the Body; so, Man being made of sociable Crea∣ture, enjoys God in and with his Fellow-Saints, unto compleat Satisfaction. But still, it's GOD in Himself, GOD in CHRIST, and GOD in the Saints that shall be All in All to us eternally. To return; When that which is perfect is come, as we shall know such as we have not known in the Flesh, (tho' not after the Flesh) so shall we know our dear, Christian Friends, that have been of our Acquaintance here in the World; but after another, more pure, and perfectly refined Man∣ner
<PB N="162" REF="004390_0167_100D7CCF976A04C0"/>of Acquaintance; according to that new and heavenly State of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that is above. Now, let the godly Reader think of this or that faith∣ful Minister of Christ, whose Preaching or Writings God has blessed to his Conversion and Edificati∣on; and removing from him all natural and mo∣ral Infirmities, (for they are Men subject to like Passions as others are, <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.17.) and enrich him, in thy Thoughts, with all Kinds and Degrees of Grace that thou couldest wish to thy self; sup∣posing thy self in the mean Time, but in such a heavenly Frame as thou hast, at some Time ex∣perienced: Would not a few Hours free Liber∣ty with such a spiritual Father in his Study, to ask Questions, entertain Discourses concerning Christ and Heaven, be better to thee than a whole Age of carnal Delights could be to any sensual Epi∣cure? Know then for thy Comfort, that holy Ministers and all their spiritual Children, their holy Brethren shall, a very little while hence, meet in Heaven; where we shall enjoy one another, converse together; and sing Praises to God and the Lamb, without a Moment's Interruption or Cessation, World without End. But Oh! The Joys and Delights, the ravishing Delights and o∣verflowing Joys, that every Moment of that end∣less Duration will give us fresh and new experi∣ence of! No Tongue of Man or Angel can ex∣press them: They will be a thousand, thousand fold higher and sweeter than we can now ima∣gine; 1 Thes. 2.19.20. <HI>For what is our Hope, or Joy, or Crown of Rejoycing? Are not even ye, in the Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his Coming? For ye are our Glory and Joy.</HI> And this Rejoycing
<PB N="163" REF="004390_0168_100D7CD3F29C11E8"/>will be mutual, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.14,— <HI>We are your Re∣joycing, even as ye also are ours in the Day of the Lord Jesus:</HI> 1 Cor. 2.9. <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</HI> The perfect Love which we shall hear to all the Saints, will make us to rejoyce in the happy, glorious State of every one, as in our own. It may seem indeed to the fond Concep∣tions of our present, Childhood State; to the carnal Apprehensions of what is natural in us, it may now seem as if we should have only cer∣tain, select Familiars in Heaven, and those such as we have heard and read, great and good Things concerning, or been related to and conversant with on Earth: But Experience will soon con∣vince us of our Mis-Conceit. We shall know the Saved of unheard of Nations, as well as those of the same Church or Family with ourselves; and the penitent Thief will be honourable in our Eyes, even as righteous <HI>Noah:</HI> (I make not the Comparison as to exact Degrees:) The Harlot <HI>Rahab</HI> dear to us as the Virgin <HI>Mary:</HI> Elect <HI>Negroes</HI> shall walk a-breast with Kings and Governour, in the Golden Streets of Heaven; while they see themselves united, as Brethren, both in the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second Adam.</HI> And truly, if we come to Degrees of Glory, Magistrates and Ministers, the rich, honourable and useful, that are also gracious, may not expect to be dignifi∣ed in Heaven according to their Superiority on Earth, unless their Places has been fill'd with Duties, and those Duties with Grace: Nor is it only Much-Doing and Well-Doing, but patient
<PB N="164" REF="004390_0169_100D7CD5A2677308"/>Suffering too, that must come into the Account: So that one whom God has placed in a lower Station, and his Grace has made such an one more faithful; — One that has had less Advan∣tage for growing in Grace, and abounding in good Works; yet, by more than ordinary Dili∣gence, has improved his smaller Stock to great∣er. Increase; — and has had an Heart enlarged abundantly towards God, and for the publick Good; — One that has not had the Opportuni∣ty of doing much for Church and Common-Wealth; yet has been all his Days afflicted, and born all with holy Submission and singular Pati∣ence; — Such ones shall doubtless be rewarded above many, their Equals, and Superiors in o∣ther Respects. But this is a Digression: How∣ever it may serve to quicken Men of great Gifts, high Place, and many Talents, to see that their Improvement be proportionable; lest they suffer a Sort of Degradation, even in Heaven it self: And it may equally serve to encourage the least and meanest of Christ's Servants; they may be great in the Kingdom of God. As all Servants will be free from their Masters there; so some may be advanced above them: But there will be no Envy.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Use with the Words of an eminently pious and learned Divine, in a Discourse concerning the Joys of Heaven.</P>
<P>'Quest. <HI>Shall the Saints know one another in Heaven?</HI> (The Question is supposed, and he answers it in the Affirmative thus —)</P>
<Q><P>Answ. <HI>We shall know one another:</HI>

<P N="1">1. All comfortable Knowlege shall be so far from being abolished, that it will be enlarged, increased, and perfected.</P>
<P>But to know one another is a comfortable Knowledge: Therefore we shall know one a∣nother.</P>
<P>Our knowledge shall be perfected; for we shall know as we are known, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.12. Which is set out by Comparison of the less. That our Knowledge then, shall differ from that now, as the Knowledge of a Child from that of a perfect Man: By a Glass from that of seeing the Thing itself: That of a plain Speech from a Riddle. Why then should we doubt of knowing one another? Especially, since our Saviour Christ setteth forth the State of the Blessed, by the Knowledge one of ano∣ther, <HI>Mat.</HI> 17. And as the Knowledge is per∣fect, so the Memory. In nothing must our Knowledge be impair'd, but better'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. We shall then enjoy every good Thing, and comfortable Gift, which may any Way increase and inlarge our Joy and Felicity.</P>
<P>But meeting there, knowing then, and con∣versing for ever with our old dear Christian Friends, and all the glorious Inhabitants of those sacred Palaces, will mightily please and refresh us with sweetest Delight: Therefore we shall know one another.</P>
<P>Society is not comfortable, without familiar Acquaintance: Be assured then, it shall not be wanting in the Height and Perfection of all Glory, Bliss and Joy. Nay, our Minds
<PB N="166" REF="004390_0171_100D7CD92C914188"/>being abundantly and beatificially illuminated with all Wisdom and Knowledge, we shall be enabled to know, not only those of former holy Acquaintance; but also Strangers, and such as we never knew before; even all the Faithful, which ever were, are, or shall be. We shall be able to say; This was Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> this King <HI>David,</HI> this Saint <HI>Paul:</HI> This was <HI>Luther, Calvin, Bradford, &amp;.</HI> This my Father, this my Son, this my Wife, this my Pastor, this the Occasioner of my Con∣version, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As may be gathered by propor∣tion out of God's Book.</P>
<P N="1">(1) If <HI>Adam</HI> before the Fall had that mea∣sure of Illumination that he knew <HI>Eve,</HI> and from whence she came, at the first Sight: much more shall our Knowledge in Heaven, and highest Happiness be enlarged in this Kind.</P>
<P N="2">(2) If the Apostles accompanying Christ in his Transfiguration, and vouchsafed but a Taste and Glimpse (as it were) of Glorification, were able thereby to know <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> whom they had never seen: How much more shall we, being fully illuminated, and perfectly glo∣rified in Heaven, know exactly all the blessed ones, tho' never acquainted with them upon Earth?</P>
<P N="3">(3) Christ tells the <HI>Jews, Luk.</HI> 13.28. That they shall see <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God; and therefore know them: And <HI>Dives</HI> is said to know <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lazarus</HI> in so great a Distance, <HI>Luke</HI> 16. Whence Largue thus; <HI>If the Damned know those who are saved, tho' they
<PB N="167" REF="004390_0172_100D7CDBA90EE8F8"/>have never seen them; much more shall the glori∣fied Saints now plentifully endowed with all Knowledge, and supernaturally enlightned by the</HI> HOLY GHOST.</P></Q>
<P>Many of the ancient Fathers (saith he) are of the same Mind;—The first he mentions is <HI>Aus∣tin,</HI> who comforting a godly Widow, while, she was mourning bitterly for the Loss of her pious Yoke-Fellow, has these Words, <HI>This thy Hus∣band, by whose Decease thou art called a Widow, shall be most known unto thee.</HI> And tells her fur∣ther, <HI>That there shall be no Stranger in Heaven.</HI> But, having offered some other Passages, of one and another of the Ancients, shewing their Con∣currence in the same Opinion, he adds; <Q>Yet let me tell you, before I pass out of the Point; that this for the most Part is the curious Quere of carnal People; who feeding falsely their presumptuous Conceits with Golden Dreams, and vain Hopes of many future, imaginary Felicities in the World to come, whereas in the mean Time they have no Care at all, use no Means, take no Pains to enter into the ho∣ly Path, which leads unto the blessed Place: —To cool and confront such lazy, idle, and vain Curiosities, take Notice; That we shall not know our old Acquaintance by former Sta∣ture, Feature, Favour: So vast a Distance and Difference will there be, between a mortal and glorified Body; neither in a worldly Manner; in which Respect saith <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.16. <HI>Henceforth know we no Man after the Flesh: Yea, tho' we have known Christ after the Flesh, yet now henceforth know we him to more.</HI> Our
<PB N="168" REF="004390_0173_100D7B3673561AE8"/>mutual Knowledge one of another in Heaven, shall not be outward and worldly Respects, but divine and spiritual; as we know them in Christ, by the Illumination of the Spirit.</Q></P>
<P>Thus wrote one that could say of what he had written and preached, That it was the Truth of God, as he should answer it at he Tribunal of Christ, before whom he should shortly appear. This he spake when the very Pangs of Death were upon him, to certain of his Hearers, who came to pay him their last Visit. And to his Wife he said, <HI>Make no Doubt thou shalt meet me a∣gain in Heaven.</HI></P>

<HEAD>USE VI. By Way of EXPOSTULATION, With careless, secure Sinners; who put far a∣way the evil Day, and put off Repentance, de∣laying to make their Peace with God. If my Reader be such an one, I would leave the fol∣lowing Questions, to be answered by his own Conscience, as he will answer it at a dreadful Tribunal another Day.</HEAD>
<P>Quest. I. <HI>What is thy End in Hearing and Read∣ing; and what didst thou propose to thy self in tak∣ing this little Book in Hand, and reading thus far?</HI> Pause a little;—and proceed not from one Question to another, 'till thou hast commu∣ned with thy self about drawing up an Answer, and settling it in thy Mind.</P>
<P>Quest. II. <HI>Is not the God that cannot lye, worthy to be believed before the Father of Lies; and has he not said, If ye live after the Flesh ye shall die; and who is it that says, Ye shall not surely die?</HI> Rom. 8.13. Gen. 3.4.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="004390_0174_100D7CE1B40496E0"/>
Quest. III. <HI>Hast thou not all the Reason in the World to fear the Wrath of the Almighty, who is angry with the Wicked every Day; and will not this Fire, that is kindled in his Anger, burn to the lowest Hell?</HI> Job 21.20. Psal. 7.11. &amp; 90.11. Deut. 32.22.</P>
<P>Quest. IV. <HI>Can any Thing be more unreasonable, than thy ungrateful, unnatural Rebellion against him, who, having first given thee thy Being, has nourished and brought thee up; after he had sent his Son, out of his Bosom to die for thee?</HI> Hear O Heavens, and give Ear O Earth; for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have rebelled against me! The Ox knows his Owner, and the Ass his Mas∣ter's Crib: but <HI>Israei</HI> does not know; my Peo∣ple doth not consider, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.2, 3.</P>
<P>Quest. V. <HI>Who will be the Gainer, in the wind∣ing up, if thou winnest Christ; and who the Loser if thou shalt lise thy Soul?</HI> Prov. 9.12. Job. 22.2, 3. Mat. 16.26.</P>
<P>Quest. VI. <HI>Is it not most likely that thy Delays will prove thy Ruin at last; thy Heart being hard∣ened thro' the Deceitfulness if Sin; and God exe∣cuting his dreadful Threatnings against thee?</HI> Prov. 1.24, to 28. &amp; 29.1. Heb. 3.13.</P>
<P>Quest. VII. <HI>Whence dust think to fetch Strength to hear, or what imaginable Comfort or Relief canst thou possibly find under the insupportable Weight of the Loss of Heaven, and Hell's additional Torments; with all the inconceivable Aggravations of both?</HI> Isa 10.3, 4.</P>
<P>Quest. VIII. <HI>What is Time</HI> (the good or evil Things of it) <HI>to Eternity?</HI> 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. Heb. 11.25.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="004390_0175_100D7CE373048430"/>
Quest. IX. <HI>To have enjoyed all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life; What Satisfaction, Content, or Pleasure can it yield thee, when the parting Time shall come?</HI> Rom. 6.21. Eccl. 2.4, to 11. 1 Tim. 6.7.</P>
<P>Quest. X. <HI>Is it not easy to foresee that Satan's Design in tempting thee to delay a little longer, and a little longer, is to engross all thy Time and Ser∣vice, tho' be does not ask thee for all at once; and would not the Devil himself tell thee, that thy wisest and safest Course would be to repent speedily, if he would speak out what he believes to be true?</HI> 2 Cor. 2.11. Eph. 6.11.</P>
<P>Quest. XI. <HI>Is it not merciless Cruelty to thy Self, to thy own Soul, to hearken to the cruel Tempter; when thou knowest, whatever he pretends, his De∣sign is thy eternal Ruin.</HI> 1 Pet. 5.8.</P>
<P>Quest. XII. <HI>Considering who and where Christ is, and what he has said, and done, and suffered, and parted with, can there be any Room left, but what is made by gross Ignorance, Infidelity and Prejudice, for thee to doubt of his Sufficiency or Willingness to help and save thee?</HI> John 6.37.</P>
<P>But, will the Lord in very deed, (says the conquered Soul) accept of me, and bid me wel∣come into his merciful Arms and Bosom of Love; into his honourable Service, and glorious King∣dom; after I have given the Devil the first and best Part of my Time and Strength? Will he accept the last and worst, and (it may be) the least Half of my Age and Time! <HI>Thine am I then, O David, and on thy Side, thou Son of God.</HI> Thus, when the Spirit of God comes upon us,
<PB N="171" REF="004390_0176_100D7CE6B8A3B5C8"/>are we made willing in the Day of his Power? And whosoever will let him come and take of the Water of Life freely, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17.</P>
<P>But, methinks I hear the secret Language of the most of my Readers, (O that ever there should be such a Thought in the wicked Heart of any! <HI>Deut.</HI> 15.9.) like that in Jer. 44.16. <HI>As for the Word that thou hast spoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee:</HI> Therefore let the last Use,</P>

<HEAD>USE VII. Be for TERROR.</HEAD>
<P>To obstinate and resolved Sinners. I must now suppose that having read over all the fore∣going Pages, thou art as little moved from thy Purpose of following thy old Trade of Sin, as those Pages, Lines, Words and Letters are moved from the Place in which (the Hand of the Prin∣ter having fixed them) thy careless Eye found and left them. However, the next that takes the Book in Hand may be such an one. <HI>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye stout Hearted, that are far from Righteousness,</HI> Isa. 46.12. I will only whisper (as it were) in thy Ear seven Things more: God can make them sound in thy sleepy Conscience, like so many Thunders.</P>

<ITEM>1. Thy Case, that is worse than can be exprest already, is growing yet worse and worse every Day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Thy sinning Time will quiekly be over.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Thy Day of Grace may be yet shorter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 If not the most, yet the best of thy Days may be past and gone already: What remains may be an evil Time; Sickness, Pains, and ten thousand Crosses may make it so, even before old Age.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="172" REF="004390_0177_100D7CE8F7395C10"/>
5. The more Pleasure thou hast had in Sin, the greater Sorrow and Torment will Justice in∣flict on thee in Hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Thy intolerable, remediless and eternal Mi∣sery is never the further off for thy Insensibility of thy Danger.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7 <HI>and finally;</HI> Thou mightest escape all this on easy Terms; and yet be happy, happy, thrice happy and blessed for ever; and thou wilt not: But this thy Refusal will afford thee no easy Re∣flection in the Bottom of Hell.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I conclude as I began, even with the Words of my Text; (Words more bitter than ten thou∣sand Deaths!) God help us all to mix them with Faith, lest we find too late, and feel for ever the Truth of what the <HI>great Prophet</HI> has here foretold, (than which I can't think of a more solemn Con∣clusion of this Discourse) <HI>There shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your selves thrust out.</HI></P>
