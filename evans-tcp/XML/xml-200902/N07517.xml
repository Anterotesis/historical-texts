<HEAD>A BATTLE, A BATTLE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN Days of <HI>Yore,</HI> our Annals say,</L>
<L>The Saints would sit at home and pray,</L>
<L>But not vouchsafe to stir an Inch</L>
<L>Or lend Assistance at a Pinch;</L>
<L>Tho' for their King's and Country's good;</L>
<L>Stiff to their Text the Quakers stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR Feuds and Quarrels they abhor 'em,</L>
<L>The LORD will fight their Battles for 'em.</L>
<L>In this of late they were so stanch</L>
<L>As not to move against the <HI>French.</HI></L>
<L>The few that did they roughly handle,</L>
<L>And curse with Bell, with Book and Candle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEY read 'em out, and rank'd 'em in</L>
<L>A Class they call'd the Men of Sin.</L>
<L>But now the Case is alter'd quite,</L>
<L>And what was wrong, is chang'd to Right.</L>
<L>These very Drones, these sluggish Cattle,</L>
<L>Prepare their Guns and Swords for Battle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="009595_0004_0F76DC7A70CD58E0"/>
<L>So Acts the sly perfidious Bat,</L>
<L>Sometimes for this side, sometimes that.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first Duke <HI>Mushroom</HI> silence broke,</L>
<L>And thus in croaking Accents spoke.</L>
<L>When Dangers threaten, 'tis mere Nonsense,</L>
<L>To talk of such a Thing as Conscience:</L>
<L>Conscience a Net has ever been,</L>
<L>To catch religious Woodcocks in:</L>
<L>But (as it is most just and fit)</L>
<L>Was made for us, not we for it.</L>
<L>To be contracted, or stretch'd wide,</L>
<L>As were the Thongs of <HI>Dido</HI>'s Hide.</L>
<L>And he whose is too great or small</L>
<L>Must answer for just none at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHERE Quaker Notions lead the Way,</L>
<L>Conscience implicit must obey.</L>
<L>For we, just like three Legs in <HI>Man,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quocunque jeceris,</HI> will stand:</L>
<L>And have a Salve for ev'ry Sore,</L>
<L>What can a Mortal wish for more?</L>
<L>Henceforth let two and two make six,</L>
<L>Or any Number you shall fix:</L>
<L>Let no one contradict you when</L>
<L>You say in four are Units ten:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="009595_0005_0F76DC7B10E3B718"/>
<L>For plain it is, and sure's a Gun,</L>
<L>Four contain four, three, two and One.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OF human Pride, tho' it may savour,</L>
<L>Let us exert our own endeavour;</L>
<L>Nor like our Fathers stand like Posts,</L>
<L>And leave all to the Lord of Hosts.</L>
<L>Our Happiness for ought we know</L>
<L>May be, <HI>durante Placito,</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND he may think he's done enough</L>
<L>Nor longer will stand by the Stuff;</L>
<L>Therefore for future, be it known,</L>
<L>We'll not confide in GOD alone,</L>
<L>But shew the World that we inherit</L>
<L>The Arm of Flesh, with Sword and Spirit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN we begin, we'll on Pel Mel</L>
<L>And drive the <HI>Paxton</HI> Dogs to H—l</L>
<L>But, hark! the Horn sounds an Express</L>
<L>From B, from R, from H, and S.</L>
<L>The <HI>Paxton</HI> Boys are coming down,</L>
<L>To kill us all, and burn the Town.</L>
<L>To Arms, to Arms with one Accord,</L>
<L>The Sword of Quakers and the Lord!</L>
<L>Let no one stand with hands in Pocket</L>
<L>Each Meeting Door—quick, quick unlock it!</L>

Be all our Forces hither led,</L>
<L>With beating Drums, and Colours spread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET Trumpets sound, and Hautboys play,</L>
<L>And set the Battle in Array;</L>
<L>Nor absent be the Pipe and Tabor,</L>
<L>To chear your hearts, and ease your Labour:</L>
<L>Cock up your Hats, look fierce and trim</L>
<L>Not wear the horizontal Brim,</L>
<L>The House of Prayer be made a Den</L>
<L>Not of vile Thieves, but armed Men:</L>
<L>Tho' 'tis indeed a Prophanation</L>
<L>Which we must expiate with Lustration.</L>

<L>But such the present Time requires</L>
<L>And such are all the Friends Desires</L>
<L>Fill Bumpers then, of Rum or' Arrack</L>
<L>We'll drink Success to the new Barrack;</L>
<L>He said, they all approv'd the Cause</L>
<L>And in full concert groan'd Applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW News arriv'd that <HI>Paxton</HI> Men,</L>
<L>Were come within nine Miles or ten;</L>
<L>The City's fill'd with Sighs and Groans</L>

<L>THEY came, they saw, they found 'em civil</L>

<L>Beg leave t'adore thy sacred Shoe-tye,</L>
<L>Because thee hast vouchsaf't to grant</L>
<L>Those Papers which the Friends did want:</L>
<L>Which Papers we have now in View,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEREFORE we pray that thee will hear us</L>
<L>And when that's done no Doubt will clear us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OUR People, Friend, as thee must know,</L>
<L>Above a hundred Years ago</L>
<L>(For 'tis so long a Period since</L>
<L>That our Religion did commence)</L>
<L>Were never found such stupid Sots,</L>
<L>As to delight in Blood and Plots;</L>
<L>Nor can their worst of Foes remember</L>
<L>They lik'd the Month thee call <HI>November.</HI></L>
<L>Tumults and Quarrels Friends abhor 'em</L>
<L>Others may fight their Battles for 'em</L>
<L>While they can sit at home in ease,</L>
<L>And eat Plum-pudding as they please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEIR Conduct was so very winning,</L>
<L>They gain'd a Liberty of sinning</L>
<L>Plain Scripture then they might deny</L>
<L>And not be ask'd a Reason why.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET these good Creatures, now and then</L>
<L>Were hardly us'd by cruel Men;</L>
<L>And underwent hard Blows and Knocks</L>

<L>The Cart, the Pillory and Stocks;</L>

<L>Came here, and left their native Land;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT now alas! with Pain and Grief</L>
<L>('Tis what we think past all Relief)</L>
<L>We have observ'd our Pow'r is lost</L>
<L>And others want to rule the Roast.</L>
<L>Intestine Feuds and Wars take Place</L>
<L>Of Concord, Unity and Peace.</L>
<L>And thus we see, what's very strange</L>
<L>All Things, but, our old Tenets change.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We have for ever careful been,</L>
<L>Not to be often caught in Sin,</L>

<L>Passive Obedience we maintain.</L>
<L>To Men in Pow'r we shew our Distance.</L>
<L>And aid the King by Non-Assistance.</L>
