<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many <HI>Customs</HI> of the World, which 'tis become almost <HI>necessary</HI> to comply withal, it seems, this is One, <HI>That a Book must not ap∣pear without a Preface.</HI> And this Little Book willingly Submits unto the <HI>Customary Ceremony.</HI> It comes with a <HI>Preface,</HI> however it shall not be one like the Gates of <HI>Mindus.</HI> But there appears a greater Difficulty in a compli∣ance with another usage; that of, <HI>An Epistle Dedicatory. Dedications</HI> are become Such foolish and fulsome <HI>Adulations,</HI> that they are now in a manner <HI>Useless.</HI> Oftentimes all the use of them is, to furnish the Criticks on, <HI>The Manners of the Age,</HI> with matter of Ridicule. The Excellent <HI>Foyl</HI> Employ'd but a just Expression, in saying; <HI>Tis almost as much out of Fashion in such Addresses, to omit giving Praises,</HI> [I may say, <HI>Unjust</HI> ones] <HI>as 'tis to Believe the Praises given on such an Occa∣sion.</HI> Sometimes the Authors themselves live to <HI>See</HI> their <HI>Own</HI> Mistakes, and <HI>Own</HI> them. An <HI>Austin</HI> makes the Flourishes, he had once used in a <HI>Dedication,</HI> an Article of his <HI>Retractations:</HI> A <HI>Calvin</HI> does Revoke a <HI>Dedication,</HI> because he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="ii" REF="001460_0003_0FB349969F8872E0"/>
he had made it unto an unworthy Person. I may add, that at other times, every One sees, what the Authors would be at, and how much they <HI>Write for themselves</HI> when they Flatter other men. A∣nother course must now be Steered.</P>
<P>If a Book of <HI>Essayes to do Good,</HI> were to be Dedicated unto a Person of Quality, it ought to Seek a Patron, who is a true <HI>Man of Honour,</HI> and of uncommon <HI>Goodness.</HI> Thy Patron, O BOOK of <HI>Benefits</HI> to the World, should be, a General and most Generous <HI>Benefactor</HI> to Man∣kind; One, who never counts himself so well <HI>Advanced,</HI> as in <HI>Stouping</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> unto all that may be the <HI>Better</HI> for him; One whose <HI>Highest Ambition</HI> is to abound in <HI>Serviceable Condescensions:</HI> A Stranger to the <HI>Gain of Oppression;</HI> The com∣mon <HI>Refuge</HI> of the Oppressed, and the Distressed; One who will know nothing that is <HI>Base;</HI> A Lover of all <HI>Good Men,</HI> in all perswasions; Able to <HI>Distinguish</HI> them, and Loving them without any <HI>Distinction.</HI> Let him also be one, who has nobly Stript himself of <HI>Emoluments</HI> and <HI>Advan∣tages,</HI> when they would have Encumbred his Opportunities, to Serve his Nation. Yea, pre∣sume upon one, who has Governed and Adorned the Greatest and Bravest City on the Face of the Earth, and so much the <HI>Delight</HI> of that City, as well as of the rest of <HI>Mankind,</HI> that she shall never count her Honour or Welfare more consulted, than when he appears for her as a <HI>Representative,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most Illustrious of all the Assemblies in

the World: Belov'd by the <HI>Queen of Cities,</HI> the fairest and richest Lady of the Universe.</P>
<P>In One Word, <HI>A Publick Spirit.</HI> Let him THEREFORE, and upon more than all these Accounts be, Sir WILLIAM ASHHURST. For as of old the Poet observed, upon mentio∣ning the Name of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> the <HI>Echo</HI> answered <HI>Philosophy:</HI> So now, <HI>A Publick Spirit,</HI> will immediately be the <HI>Echo</HI> and Reply, in the sense of All men, and with a Repetition oftner than that at <HI>Pant-Chareton;</HI> if the Name of Sir WILLIAM ASHHURST, once be mentio∣ned. HE 'tis whom the Confession of <HI>All Men</HI> brings into the Catalogue, with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Joseph,</HI> and those other Ancient Blessings, who are thus Excellently described by <HI>Grotious; Ho∣mines demerendis hominibus nati, qui Omnem Bene∣ficij Collocandi Occasionem Ponebant in Lucro. Ame∣rica</HI> afar off also knows him; the <HI>American</HI> Co∣lonies, have their Eye upon the Efforts of his <HI>Goodness</HI> for them. <HI>Norunt, Et Antipodes.</HI> Nations of Christianized <HI>Indians</HI> likewise pray for him, as their GOVERNOUR. To <HI>Him,</HI> the Design of such a Book will be Acceptable; whatever may be, the Poor and Mean way of treating the <HI>Noble Subject,</HI> which it would insist upon. To <HI>Him</HI> it wishes that all the Blessings of those who <HI>Devise Good,</HI> may be for ever multiplied.</P>
<P>I will presume to do something, that will carry a Sweet Harmony, with One of the Main Methods to be observed in Prosecuting the De∣sign
<PB N="iv" REF="001460_0005_0FB34999F60ACEF0"/>
of this Book; which is, For <HI>Brethren to Dwell together in Unity,</HI> and carry on every Good De∣sign with <HI>United Endeavours.</HI> —</P>
<P>They will Pardon me, if I take the leave to joyn with him, in the Testimonies of our Great Esteem, for an Honourable Disposition to <HI>Love Good Men,</HI> and to <HI>Do Good in the World,</HI> his Excellent Brother-in-Law. The well-known Name of a, JOSEPH THOMPSON, has long been valued, and shall alwayes be Remembred, in the Coun∣try where this Book is Published. God will be Glorified, for the Piety which adorns him, and the <HI>Pure Religion,</HI> which in the midst of the World, and of Temptations from it, keeps him so <HI>Unspotted from the World.</HI> It was the Maxim of a Pagan <HI>Asdrubal</HI> in <HI>Livy, Raro simul hominibus, bona Fortuna, bonaque mens datur. Christianity</HI> will, in this Gentleman, give to the World, an happy Experiment, that the Maxim is capable of a con∣futation. Because a Book of <HI>Essayes to Do Good,</HI> will doubtless find its Agreeable Acceptance with One of So <HI>Good a Mind,</HI> and the Treasurer of a Corporation formed on the Intention to do in <HI>America</HI> that Good which is of all the greatest, whereof Sir <HI>William Ashhurst</HI> is the Governour, he also has a part in the Humble Tender of it; and it must wish unto Him <HI>all the Blessings of Goodness.</HI></P>
<P>The BOOK requires that now some Account be given of it. It was a Passage, in a Speech of an Envoy from His <HI>Britanick</HI> Majesty, to the
<PB N="v" REF="001460_0006_0FB3499B79B05B38"/>
Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Twenty years ago; <HI>A Capacity to Do Good, not only gives a Title to it, but also makes the doing of it a Duty. Ink</HI> were too vile a Liquor to Write that Passage. <HI>Letters of Gold</HI> were too Mean, to be the Preservers of it. Paper of <HI>Amyanthus</HI> would not be Precious and Perennous enough, to perpetuate it.</P>
<P>To be brief, Reader, The <HI>Book</HI> now in thy Hands, is nothing but an Illustration, and a Pro∣secution of that Memorable Sentence. As <HI>Gold</HI> is capable of a Wonderful Dilatation; Experi∣ment has told us, it may be so dilated, that the Hundred thousandth part of a <HI>Grain,</HI> may be vi∣sible without a <HI>Microscope:</HI> This <HI>Golden Sentence</HI> may be as much Extended; no man can say how much. This Book is but a <HI>Beating</HI> upon it. And at the same time, 'tis a Commentary on that Inspired Maxim, Gal. VI. 10. <HI>As we have Oppor∣tunity, let us do Good unto all men:</HI> Every <HI>Propo∣sal</HI> here made upon it hopes to be able to say, <HI>When I am tried, I shall come forth as Gold.</HI></P>
<P>I have not been left altogether Uninformed, That all the Rules of <HI>Discretion</HI> and <HI>Behaviour,</HI> are embryo'd in that One Word, MODESTY. But it will be no breach of <HI>Modesty,</HI> to be very <HI>Po∣sitive</HI> in asserting, That the only <HI>Wisdom</HI> of Man, lies in Conversing with the Great GOD, and His Glorious CHRIST; and in Engaging as many others as we can, to joyn with us in this our Blessedness; thereby Promoting His <HI>King∣dom</HI> among the Children of Men; and in Stu∣dying
<PB N="vi" REF="001460_0007_0FB3499CA28DE6C8"/>
to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto all about us; to be <HI>Bles∣sings</HI> in our several Relations; to heal the Dis∣orders, and help the Distresses of a Miserable World, as far as ever we can Extend our Influen∣ces. It will be no Trespass upon the Rules of <HI>Modesty,</HI> with all possible <HI>Assurance</HI> to assert. That no man begins to be <HI>Wise,</HI> till he come to make this the <HI>Main</HI> Purpose and Pleasure of his Life; Yea, that every Man will at some time or other be so <HI>Wise</HI> as to own, that every thing without this is but <HI>Folly,</HI> tho' alas, the most of Men come not unto it, until it be <HI>Too Late.</HI></P>
<P>Millions of Men, in all Ranks, besides those whose <HI>Dying</HI> Thoughts are collected in, <HI>The Fair Warnings to a careless World,</HI> have at length de∣clared their Conviction of it. It will be no <HI>Im∣modesty</HI> in me to say, The Man who is not Satis∣fyed of the <HI>Wisdom</HI> in making it the Work of his <HI>Life</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> is alwayes to be beheld with the Pity due to an <HI>Ideot.</HI> No <HI>First Principles</HI> are more <HI>Peremptorily</HI> to be adhered unto. Or, Do but grant <HI>A Judgment to come,</HI> and my Assertion is presently victorious.</P>
<P>I will not be <HI>Immodest,</HI> and yet I will boldly say, The Man is worse than a <HI>Pagan,</HI> who will not come into this Notion of things, <HI>Vir Bonus est Commune Bonum;</HI> and <HI>Vivit is qui multis est usui;</HI> and <HI>Utilitate Hominum, nil debet esse Homini Antiquius.</HI> None but a <HI>Good Man,</HI> is really a <HI>Living</HI> Man; And the more <HI>Good</HI> any Man does, the more he really <HI>Lives, All the rest is Death;</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="001460_0008_0FB3499E20E7EF58"/>
or belongs to it. Yea, you must Excuse me, if I say, The <HI>Mahometan</HI> also shall condemn the Man, who comes not into the Principles of this Book. For I think, it occurs no less than Three Times in the <HI>Alcoran; God Loves those that are in∣clined to do Good.</HI></P>
<P>For this <HI>way of Living,</HI> if we are fallen into a <HI>Generation,</HI> wherein men will cry, <HI>[Sotah!] He's a Fool,</HI> of him that practises it, as the Rabbi's foretel, 'twil be in the <HI>Generation wherein the Mes∣siah comes;</HI> yet there will be a <HI>Wiser</HI> Generation, and <HI>Wisdom will be Justified of her Children.</HI> A∣mong the Jews, there has been an <HI>Ezra,</HI> whose <HI>Head</HI> they called, <HI>The Throne of Wisdom:</HI> Among the <HI>Greeks</HI> there has been a <HI>Democritus,</HI> who was called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in the Abstract; The Later Ages knew a <HI>Gildas,</HI> who wore the Sirname of, <HI>Sa∣piens;</HI> But it is the man whose <HI>Temper</HI> &amp; <HI>Intent</HI> it is, <HI>To Do Good,</HI> that is the Truly <HI>Wise man</HI> af∣ter all. And indeed had a man, the Hands of a <HI>Briareus,</HI> they would all be too few to <HI>Do Good;</HI> He might find occasions to call for more than all of them. The English Nation once had a Sect of men called, <HI>Bon-hommes,</HI> or, <HI>Good men.</HI> The Ambition of this Book, is to Revive and Enlarge a <HI>Sect</HI> that may claim that Name; yea, to Sollicit, that it may Extend beyond the Bounds of a <HI>Sect,</HI> by the coming of <HI>all men</HI> into it.</P>
<P>Of all the <HI>Trees in the Garden of God,</HI> which is there, that Envies not the <HI>Palm-tree,</HI> out of which alone <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us, the <HI>Babylonians</HI> fetch'd
<PB N="viii" REF="001460_0009_0FB3499FA16D4FE0"/>
more than Three Hundred Commodities? Or the <HI>Coco-tree,</HI> so Beneficial to Man, that a Vessel may be built, and rigg'd, and freighted and Victualled from that alone? To <HI>Plant</HI> such <HI>Trees of Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Prune</HI> them, is the Hope of the Book now before us.</P>
<P>The Men who <HI>Devise Good,</HI> will now give me leave to mind them of Some things, by which they may be a little Fortified for their Grand Intention; For, Sirs, you are to pass between <HI>Boz<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z</HI> (or, Dirty,) and <HI>Seneh,</HI> (or Thorny) and Encounter an Host of things worse than <HI>Philistines,</HI> in your undertaking.</P>
<P><HI>Misconstruction</HI> is One thing against which you will do well to furnish your selves with the Armour both of <HI>Prudence</HI> and of <HI>Patience;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the preventing of it, <HI>Patience</HI> for the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it. You will unavoidably be put upon the Doing of many <HI>Good Things,</HI> which o∣ther People will see but <HI>at a Distance,</HI> and be unacquainted with the <HI>Motives</HI> and <HI>Methods</HI> of your doing them; yea, they may imagine their own <HI>Purposes</HI> crossed, or clogged in what you do; and this will expose you to their censures. Yet more particularly; In your <HI>Essayes to Do Good,</HI> you may happen to be concerned with Persons, whose <HI>Power</HI> is greater than their <HI>Vertue.</HI> It may be <HI>Needful</HI> as well as <HI>Lawful,</HI> for you, to molli∣fy them, with Acknowledgments of those things in them which may render them <HI>Honourable</HI> or <HI>Considerable,</HI> and forbear to take Notice at the
<PB N="ix" REF="001460_0010_0FB349A149066CC0"/>
present, of what may be <HI>Culpable.</HI> In this, you may aim at nothing under Heaven, but only, that you may be the more Able to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto <HI>them;</HI> or by <HI>Them</HI> to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto others. And yet, if you are not very wary, this your <HI>Civility</HI> may prove your <HI>Disadvantage:</HI> Especially, if you find your selves obliged, either to change your <HI>Opinion</HI> of the Persons, or to tax any <HI>Mis∣carriage</HI> in them. The Injustice of the Censures upon you, may be much, as if <HI>Paul</HI> rebuking <HI>Felix</HI> for his <HI>Unrighteousness</HI> and <HI>Unchastity,</HI> should have been twitted with it, as an <HI>Inconstancy,</HI> and <HI>Inconsistency,</HI> in that very lately he had comple∣mented this very <HI>Felix,</HI> and said, He way very glad he had One of such Abilities and Accom∣plishments to be concerned withal, and one so well acquainted with the affairs of his Nation. But you must not be <HI>Uneasy,</HI> if you should be thus unjustly dealt withal. <HI>Jerom</HI> had written highly, of <HI>Origen,</HI> as a Man of bright Endow∣ments; Anon he wrote as hardly against some things that <HI>Origen</HI> was (it may be, wrongfully) accused of. They cried out upon <HI>Jerom</HI> for his <HI>Levity,</HI> yea, <HI>Falsity.</HI> He despised the calumny, and reply'd; <HI>I did once commend, what I thought was Great in him; and now condemn what I find to be Evil in him.</HI> I Pray, where's the contradicti∣on! I Say, Be cautious; But I say again, Be not <HI>Uneasy.</HI></P>
<P>What I add unto it, is; That you must be above all <HI>Discouragements.</HI> Look for
<PB N="x" REF="001460_0011_0FB349A29E9F2C20"/>
them, and with a magnanimous <HI>Courage</HI> over∣look them.</P>
<P>Some have Observed, That the most <HI>Concealed,</HI> and yet the most <HI>Violent,</HI> of all our <HI>Passions,</HI> usu∣ally is that of <HI>Idleness.</HI> It layes <HI>Adamantine Chains</HI> of Death and of Darkness upon us. It holds in <HI>Chains</HI> that cannot be shaken off, all our other, tho' never so Impetuous Inclinations. That no more <HI>Hurt</HI> is done in the World, is very much owing to a Sort of <HI>Scorbutick</HI> and <HI>Sponta∣neous</HI> Lassitude on the Minds of men, as well as that no more <HI>Good</HI> is done. A <HI>Pharaoh</HI> will do us no wrong if he tell us, <HI>Ye are Idle, ye are I∣dle.</HI> We have usually more <HI>Strength</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> than we have <HI>Will</HI> to lay it out. Sirs, <HI>Be up, and be Doing!</HI> Tis too soon yet sure for an <HI>Hic Situs est.</HI></P>
<P>If you meet with vile <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> from those whom you have laid under the most <HI>Weighty Obligations;</HI> Don't wonder at it. Such a <HI>Turpitude</HI> is the Nature of man sunk into, that men had rather bear any <HI>Weight</HI> than that of <HI>Obligations.</HI> They will own small ones; but return wonderful Hatred and Malice for such as are Extraordinary. They will render it a <HI>Dan∣gerous</HI> Thing, to be very <HI>Charitable</HI> and <HI>Beneficent. Communities</HI> will do it as well as <HI>Individuals. Excess</HI> of <HI>Desert</HI> at length turns into a kind of <HI>De∣merit.</HI> Men will sooner Forgive Great <HI>Injuries,</HI> than Great <HI>Services.</HI> He that built a Matchless Castle for the <HI>Poles,</HI> for his <HI>Reward,</HI> had his <HI>Eyes put out,</HI> that he might not build such another.
<PB N="xi" REF="001460_0012_0FB349A420051CF0"/>
Such Things are enough to make one <HI>Sick of the World;</HI> but, my Friend, they should not make thee <HI>Sick</HI> of <HI>Essayes to do Good in the World.</HI> A <HI>Conformity</HI> to thy Saviour, and a <HI>Communion</HI> with Him, Let that carry thee through all!</P>
<P>T'will be impossible to Avoid <HI>Envy.</HI> For a <HI>Right Work,</HI> and for a <HI>Good</HI> one, and especially, if a man do <HI>Many</HI> Such, he shall be <HI>Envied of his Neighbour.</HI> Tis incredible, the Force that the <HI>Pride</HI> of men, has to produce <HI>Detraction! Pride,</HI> working in a sort of <HI>Impatience,</HI> that any man should be, or do more than they. The Minds of men, as One says, <HI>have got the Vapours; A Sweet Report of any one throwes them into Convulsi∣ons and Agonies; a Foul one refreshes 'em.</HI> You must bear all the <HI>Outrage</HI> of it; and there is but one sort of <HI>Revenge</HI> to be allow'd you. One sayes, <HI>There is not any Revenge more Heroick, than that which torments Envy by doing of Good.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Surprizing Passage, which a late <HI>French</HI> Author has given us; <Q>That a man <HI>of Good Me∣rit,</HI> is a Kind of <HI>Publick Enemy.</HI> And that by <HI>Engrossing</HI> a great many Applauses, which would serve to gratify a great many others, he can∣not but be <HI>Envied;</HI> And that men do natu∣rally <HI>hate,</HI> what they <HI>Esteem</HI> very much, but cannot <HI>Love.</HI></Q> But, my Readers, Let us not be Surprized at it. You have Read, who Suffered the <HI>Ostracisms</HI> at <HI>Athens;</HI> and what a pretty Rea∣son the Country Fellow had, why he gave his Voice, for the Banishing of <HI>Aristides;</HI> [Because
<PB N="xii" REF="001460_0013_0FB349A59F81C008"/>
he was every where always called, <HI>The Just:</HI>] and for what Reason the <HI>Ephori</HI> laid a mulct upon <HI>Agesilaus;</HI> [Because he did above other men possess the Hearts of the <HI>Lacedaemonians.</HI>] You have Read, the Reason why the <HI>Ephesians</HI> Expelled the best of their Citizens: <HI>[Nemo de nobis unus Excellat; sed si quis Extiterit, alio in Loco, et apud alios sit:]</HI> If any will Out-do their Neighbours, let 'em find Another Place to do it. You have Read, That he who conquered <HI>Ha∣nibal,</HI> saw it necessary to Retire from <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Merit of others might have more Notice taken of it. My Authors tell me, <HI>At all times, nothing has been more dangerous among men than too shining a Merit.</HI> But, my Readers, The Terror of this <HI>Envy</HI> must not intimidate you I must press you, to <HI>Do Good,</HI> and be so far from <HI>Affrighted</HI> at, that you shall rather be generously <HI>Delighted</HI> in, the most Envious <HI>Deplumations.</HI></P>
<P>I wish I may prove a <HI>False Prophet,</HI> when I foretel you one <HI>Discouragement</HI> more, which you will have to conflict withal. <HI>Derision</HI> is what I mean. And, Let not my <HI>Prediction</HI> be <HI>Derided,</HI> I pray. It was long since noted, <HI>Ridiculum Acri Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat res.</HI> It is a thing of late Started, that the way of <HI>Banter,</HI> and <HI>Scoffing;</HI> and <HI>Ridicule,</HI> or, the <HI>Bart'lemew-Fair Method,</HI> as they please to cal it; is a more Effectual way to discourage all <HI>Good∣ness,</HI> and put it out of countenance, than <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Faggot.</HI> No <HI>Cruelties</HI> are so Insupportable
<PB N="xiii" REF="001460_0014_0FB349A834CF12D0"/>
to Humanity, as <HI>Cruel Mockings.</HI> It is extremely probable, that the <HI>Devil</HI> being somewhat <HI>Chained</HI> up in several Places, from the other wayes of <HI>Persecution,</HI> will more than ever apply himself to <HI>this. Essayes to Do Good,</HI> shall be Derided, with all the <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Wit,</HI> that he can inspire into his <HI>Janizaries:</HI> [a <HI>Yani-cheer,</HI> or, <HI>A New Order,</HI> the Grand Segniour of Hell has Instituted.] Exqui∣site <HI>Profaneness</HI> and <HI>Buffooury</HI> shall try their skill to Laugh People out of them. The Men who abound in them, shall be Exposed on the <HI>Stage; Libels,</HI> and <HI>Lampoons,</HI> and <HI>Satyrs,</HI> the moist poinant that ever were invented, shall be darted at them; and <HI>Pamphlets</HI> full of Lying Stories, be Scattered, with a design to make them <HI>Ridiculous. Hic se aperit Diabolus!</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> will try, whether the <HI>Fear of being Laugh'd at,</HI> will not Cool and Scare, a <HI>Zeal to Do Good,</HI> out of the World. — <HI>Sed tu contra audentior ito.</HI> Sirs, <HI>Despise the Shame,</HI> whatever <HI>Contradiction of Sinners</HI> you meet with∣al; you know, what Example did so before you. <HI>Quit you like men, Be Strong;</HI> you know who gives you the Direction.

If they go to Ridicule you in their Printed Excursions, your Name will be so <HI>Oyl'd,</HI> no Ink will Stick upon it. I remember, <HI>Valerianus Magnus</HI> being abused by a <HI>Jesuite,</HI> who had Laboured (by a <HI>Modest enquiry,</HI> you may be sure!) to make him Ridiculous, made no other Defence, but only on every Stroke adjoyned, <HI>Mentiris Impudentissime.</HI> It is a most <HI>Impudent Lye!</HI> Sir. And such an Answer might very truly be given, to every Line of some Stories that I have seen else where <HI>brewed</HI> by another, who is <HI>no Jesuite.</HI> But even <HI>so much Answer</HI> to their <HI>Folly,</HI> is <HI>too much Notice</HI> of it. It is well observed, <HI>The Contempt of such Discourses discredits them, and takes away the Pleasure from those that make them.</HI> And it is another Observation, <HI>That when they of whom we have heard very ill, yet are found by us upon Trial to be very Good, we naturally conclude, they have a Merit that is Troublesome to some other People.</HI> The Rule than is, <HI>Be</HI> very <HI>Good,</HI> yea, <HI>Do</HI> very much <HI>Good;</HI> and cast a Generous <HI>Disdain</HI> upon <HI>Con∣tumelies;</HI>

the <HI>Great Remedy</HI> against them. If you want a Pattern I can give you an Imperial one; It was a <HI>Vespesian,</HI> who when one spoke ill of him, said, <HI>Ego, cum nihil faciam dignum propter quod con∣tumelia afficiar, mendacia nihil curo.</HI> And I am deceived, if it be not an Easy thing to be as Honest a Man as a <HI>Vespasian!</HI></P>
<P>Sirs, An Unfainting Resolution to <HI>Do Good,</HI> and an <HI>Unwearied well-doing,</HI> is the Thing, that is now urged upon you. And may this Little <HI>Book</HI> now be so Happy, as herein to do the part of a <HI>Monitor,</HI> unto the Readers of it.</P>
<P>I don't find that I have spent so many Weeks in Composing the Book, as <HI>Descartes,</HI> tho' a Pro∣found <HI>Geometrician,</HI> declares he spent in Study∣ing the Solution of one <HI>Geometrical Question.</HI> Yet the Composure is grown beyond what I de∣sired it should have done; and there is not one <HI>Proposal</HI> in it, but what well Pursued, would yield the mind a more Solid and Lasting Satis∣faction, than the Solution of all the <HI>Problems</HI> in <HI>Euclid,</HI> or in <HI>Pappus.</HI> Tis a Vanity in Writers, to Complement the Readers, with a, <HI>Sorry 'tis no better.</HI> Instead of <HI>that,</HI> I freely tell my Readers, <HI>I have Written what it not unworthy of their Perusal.</HI> If I did not Think so, truly, I would not Pub∣lish it. For no man Living has demanded it of me; 'tis not Published, <HI>To gratify the Importunity of Friends,</HI> as your Authors use to trifle; but it is to <HI>Use an Importunity with others,</HI> in a Point, on which I thought they wanted it. And I will

venture to say, There is not one <HI>Whimsey</HI> in all my <HI>Proposals.</HI> I propose nothing, but what the <HI>Conscience</HI> of every Good Man will say, <HI>It were well, if it could be accomplished.</HI> That Writer was in the Right of it, who says, <HI>I can't understand, how any honest Man can Print a Book, and yet profess, that he thinks none will be the Wiser or Better for the Reading of it.</HI> Indeed, I own that my Subject is worthy to be much <HI>Better</HI> Handled, and my man∣ner of Handling it is not such that I dare do as the famous Painter <HI>Titian</HI> did on his Pieces, write my Name, with a double, <HI>Fecit, Fecit,</HI> as much as to say, <HI>Very well done:</HI> and I must have utterly Suppressed it, if I had been of the same Humour, with <HI>Cimabus</HI> another famous Painter, who, if himself or any other Spyed the least Fault in his Pieces, would utterly deface them and destroy them, tho' he had bestow'd a Twelve-months pains upon them. Yet I will venture to say, The Book is full of <HI>Reasonable</HI> and <HI>Serviceable</HI> Things; and it would be well for us, if such things were hearken'd to; and I have <HI>Done well</HI> to offer them.</P>
<P><HI>Who</HI> is the Author, there is no Need of Enqui∣ring. This will be unavoidably known in the Vicinity. But his Writing <HI>without</HI> a Name, (as well as <HI>not for One,</HI>) will conceal if from the most of those to whom the Book may come. And the concealment of his Name, he appre∣hends, may be of some Use to the Book; for now, not, <HI>Who,</HI> but, <HI>What,</HI> is the only thing to be Considered.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="001460_0018_0FB349ADDFA05BF8"/>It was a Vanity in One Author, and there may be too many Guilty of the Like; To de∣mand, <HI>Ubi mea Legis, me Agnosce.</HI> In true un∣blushing English, <HI>Reader, whatever you do, count the Author Some-body.</HI> But, I Pray, Sir, what are <HI>You,</HI> that Mankind should be at all concerned a∣bout you?

<P>However, He is very Strongly perswaded, There is a Day very near at hand, when Books of such a Tendency as this, will be the most welcome Things imaginable, to many Thou∣sands of Readers, and have more than One Edi∣tion.

<P>A vast Variety of <HI>New wayes to Do Good</HI> will be litt upon; <HI>Pathes</HI> which no Fowl of the Best Flight at Noble Designs has yet <HI>known;</HI> and which the <HI>Vultures</HI> most Piercing Eye has not yet seen, and where the <HI>Lions</HI> of the Strongest Resolution have never passed.</P>
<P>In the mean time, North BRITAIN will be <HI>Distinguish'd,</HI> [Pardon me, if I use the Term, <HI>Gosheniz'd,</HI>] by Irradiations from Heaven upon it, of such a Tendency. There will be found a Set of Excellent Men, in that Reformed and

To These, this BOOK is humbly presented, by a Great Ad∣mirer of the <HI>Good Things</HI> daily doing among them; as Knowing, That if no where else, yet among <HI>them,</HI> it will find some Reception; They will <HI>not be forgetful to Entertain</HI> such a <HI>Stranger!</HI>—</P>
<P>The censure of <HI>Writing too much,</HI> (no, tho' he should go as far as <HI>Terentianus Carthaginensis</HI> tells us <HI>Varro</HI> did,) he counts not worth Answering. — And, I Pray, why not also <HI>Preaching too much!</HI> — But <HI>Erasmus,</HI> who wrote more, has furnish'd him with a Answer, which is all that ever he intends to give unto it; <HI>Accusant quod nimium fecerim; conscientia mea me Accusat, quod minus fe∣cerim, quedque <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> feurim.</HI> In plain Ingenu∣ous English; The <HI>Censure</HI> of others upbraids me, that I have done so <HI>much;</HI> my own <HI>Con∣science</HI> condemns me that I have done so <HI>Little</HI> The Good God forgive my <HI>Slotfulness!</HI></P>

<P N="1">§ 1. SUCH <HI>Glorious Things are Spoken</HI> in the Oracles of our Good God, concerning them who <HI>Devise Good,</HI> that, <HI>A Book of Good De∣vices,</HI> may very reasonably de∣mand Attention &amp; Acceptance from them that have any Impressions of the most <HI>Reasonable Reli∣gion</HI> upon them. I am <HI>Devising</HI> Such a <HI>Book;</HI> but at the same time Offering a Sorrowful De∣monstration, That if men would Set themselves to <HI>Devise Good,</HI> a world of <HI>Good</HI> might be done, more than there is, in this <HI>Present Evil World.</HI> It is very sure, The World has <HI>Need Enough.</HI> There Needs abundance to be done, That the Great GOD and His CHRIST may be more Known and Serv'd in the World; and that the <HI>Errors</HI> which are <HI>Impediments</HI> to the <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> wherewith men ought to Glorify their Creator and Redeemer, may be Rectified. There needs abundance to be done, That the <HI>Evil Manners</HI> of the World, by which men are <HI>drowned in Per∣dition,</HI> may be Reformed; and mankind rescued from the Epidemical Corruption and Slavery which has overwhelmed it. There needs abun∣dance

to be done, That the <HI>Miseries</HI> of the World may have <HI>Remedies</HI> and <HI>Abatements</HI> pro∣vided for them; and that miserable people may be Relieved and Comforted. The world has according to the Computation of Some, a∣bove Seven hundred millions of people now Living in it. What an ample Field among all these, to <HI>Do Good</HI> upon! In a word, <HI>The Kingdom of God</HI> in the World, Calls for Innumerable <HI>Ser∣vices</HI> from us. To Do SUCH THINGS is to <HI>Do Good.</HI> Those men <HI>Devise Good,</HI> who Shape any DEVICES to do Things of Such a Tendency; whether the Things be of a <HI>Spiritual</HI> Importance, or of a <HI>Temporal.</HI> You see, Sirs, the General matter, appearing as Yet, but as a <HI>Chaos,</HI> which is to be wrought upon. <HI>Oh! that the Good Spirit of God may now fall upon us, and carry on the Glorious work which lies before us!</HI></P>
<P N="2">§ 2.

any other than one by whom <HI>Humanity</HI> it self is Debased and Blemished. A very <HI>Wicked Writer,</HI> has yet found himself compell'd by the Force of <HI>Reason,</HI> to publish this Confession. <HI>To Love the Publick, to Study an Universal Good, and to Promote the Interest of the whole World, as far as is in our Power, is surely the Highest of Goodness, and makes that Temper, which we call Divine.</HI> And, he goes on. <HI>Is the Doing of Good for Glories Sake so Divine a thing?</HI> [Alas, Too much <HI>Humane,</HI> Sir!] <HI>Or, Is it not a Diviner to Do Good, even where it may be thought Inglorious? Even unto the Ingrateful, and unto those who are wholly Insensible of the Good they receive!</HI> A man must be far gone in <HI>Wickedness,</HI> who will open his Mouth, against such <HI>Maxims</HI> and <HI>Actions!</HI> A better Pen has Remark'd it; yea, the man must be much a Stranger in Histo∣ry, who has not made the Remark. <HI>To Speak Truth, and to Do Good, were in the Esteem even of the Heathen World, most God-like Qualities.</HI> God forbid, That in the Esteem of the <HI>Christian World,</HI> for those Qualities, there should be any Abate∣ment!</P>

Thing it self, if God will Accept them to <HI>Do Good</HI> in the World. It is an Invaluable <HI>Honour,</HI> To <HI>Do Good;</HI> It is an Incomparable <HI>Pleasure.</HI> A Man must Look upon himself as <HI>Dignifyed</HI> and <HI>Gratifyed</HI> by GOD, when an <HI>Opportunity</HI> to <HI>Do Good</HI> is put into his Hands. He must Embrace it with <HI>Rapture,</HI> as enabling him directly to an∣swer the Great END of his Being. He must manage it with <HI>Rapturous Delight,</HI> as a most Sui∣table Business, as a most Precious Priviledge. He must <HI>Sing in those Wayes of the Lord,</HI> wherein he cannot but find himself, while he is <HI>Doing of Good.</HI> As the Saint of Old Sweet∣ly Sang, <HI>I was glad, when they said unto me, Let us go into the House of the Lord.</HI> Thus ought we to be <HI>Glad,</HI> when any <HI>Opportunity</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> is offered unto us. We should need no <HI>Arguments,</HI> to make us Entertain the Offer; but we should <HI>Naturally</HI> fly into the Matter, as most agreeable to the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> whereof we are <HI>made Par∣takers.</HI> It should <HI>Oblige</HI> us wonderfully! An Ingot of Gold presented unto us, not more Ob∣liging! Think, Sirs, <HI>Now I Enjoy what I Am for! Now I Attain what I Wish for!</HI> Some Servants of God have been so Strongly Disposed this way, that they have cheerfully made a Tender of any <HI>Recompence</HI> that could be desired, (yea, rather than fail, a <HI>Pecuniary</HI> one,) unto any Friend that would <HI>Think</HI> for them, and <HI>Supply</HI> the <HI>Barren∣ness</HI> of their Thoughts, and <HI>Suggest</HI> unto them a∣ny Special and proper <HI>Methods,</HI> wherein they

may be <HI>Serviceable.</HI> Certainly, To <HI>Do Good</HI> is a thing that brings its own <HI>Recompence,</HI> in the O∣pinion of those, who reckon a kind <HI>Information</HI> of a Point wherein they may <HI>Do Good,</HI> worthy to be by them requited with a <HI>Recompence</HI> to the <HI>Informer.</HI> I will only Say; If any of you are Strangers unto such a Disposition as this, to Look upon an <HI>Opportunity</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> as a thing that <HI>Enriches</HI> you, and to Look upon your selves as <HI>Enriched,</HI> and <HI>Favoured</HI> of God, when He does Employ you to <HI>Do Good:</HI> I have done with you, I would pray them, to lay the <HI>Book</HI> aside; It will disdain to carry on any further Conversa∣tion with 'em! It handles a Subject on which the Wretches of the House of <HI>Caleb,</HI> will not be conversed withal.

Begin a <HI>Course of Thoughts,</HI> which when begun, will be like a <HI>Resurrection from the Dead.</HI> They <HI>which dwell in the Dust, Wake and Sing,</HI> and a Little anticipate the <HI>Life</HI> which we are to Live at the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> when they Liveli∣ly set themselves to Think; <HI>How may I be a Bles∣sing in the World?</HI> And, <HI>What may I do, that Righ∣teousness may more dwell in the World?</HI></P>
<P N="6">§ 6. HOw much <HI>Hurt</HI> may be done by <HI>One Wicked man?</HI> Yea, Sometimes <HI>One Wicked man,</HI> of but Small Abilities, becoming an <HI>Indefatigable Tool of the Devil,</HI> may do an Incredi∣ble Deal of Mischief in the World. We have

seen some Wretched Instruments of <HI>Cursed Me∣mory,</HI> ply the Intention of <HI>Doing Mischief,</HI> at a Strange rate; until they have undone a whole Country; yea, unto the undoing of more than Three Kingdoms. 'Tis a Melancholy conside∣ration, which I am now upon: and I may say, an Astonishing One! You will hardly find <HI>One of a Thousand,</HI> who does near so much, to Serve God and Christ, and his own Soul, as you may see done by Thousands to Serve the Devil. <HI>An horrible Thing!</HI></P>
<P><Q>O my Soul; Thy <HI>Maker,</HI> and thy <HI>Saviour,</HI> so wor∣thy of thy Love, and thy All! A Lord, whose infi∣nite Goodness, will follow all that thou doest for Him, with Remunerations, beyond all Apprehensi∣on Glorious! How Little, How little, is it that thou doest for Him! At the same time, look into thy Neighbourhood; See there a monster of Wickedness, who to his uttermost will Serve a Devil, that will prove a <HI>Destroyer</HI> unto him, and all whose <HI>Wages</HI> will be <HI>Torments.</HI> He <HI>Studies</HI> how to Serve the <HI>Devil;</HI> he is never weary of his <HI>Drudgery;</HI> he racks his <HI>Inven∣tion</HI> to go thorough with it. He <HI>Shames</HI> me, he <HI>Shames</HI> me wonderfully! <HI>O my God, I am ashamed, and blush to Lift up my Face unto thee, my God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There is a man, of whom we read; <HI>He Devi∣seth mischief upon his Bed, he Sets himself in a way that is not Good.</HI> Now, I beseech you, why should not we be as <HI>Active,</HI> as <HI>Frequent,</HI> as <HI>Forward,</HI> in <HI>Devising of Good;</HI> and as full of <HI>Exquisite Contri∣vance?</HI> Why should not we be as <HI>Wise to Do Good,</HI> as any People are <HI>Wise to do Evil?</HI> I am sure, we have a <HI>better Cause▪</HI> and there is more of
<PB N="31" REF="001460_0032_0FB349C39FCED280"/>
<HI>Reason</HI> for it. My Friend, Tho' thou art One that makes but a <HI>Little Figure</HI> in the World, and a <HI>Brother of Low Degree,</HI> behold, a vast Encourage∣ment! A <HI>Little</HI> man may do a great deal of <HI>Hurt.</HI> And then, why may not a <HI>Little</HI> man, do a great deal of <HI>Good!</HI> It is possible the <HI>Wisdom of a Poor man,</HI> may Start a Proposal, that may <HI>Save a City,</HI> Serve a Nation! A <HI>Single Hair</HI> ap∣plied unto a <HI>Flyer,</HI> that has other Wheels depend∣ing on it, may pull up an <HI>Oak,</HI> or pull down an <HI>House.</HI></P>
<P>It is very Observable, That when our Lord JESUS CHRIST, would recommend this <HI>Zeal,</HI> with which the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI> is to be Served, He did not mention an Exemple of <HI>Honest Wis∣dom;</HI> no, but of an Unrighteous and Scandalous <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> (as of an <HI>Unjust Steward,</HI>) for our E∣mulation. The <HI>Wisdom</HI> of our Lord in this mat∣ter, is much to be observed. His Design is, not only to represent the <HI>Prudence,</HI> but also the vast Industry, Ingenuity, Resolution, and <HI>Heroick Ef∣fort of Soul,</HI> necessary in them, that would Seek and Serve the Kingdom of Heaven. There is no where to be found among men, that <HI>Vivacity of Spirit</HI> in <HI>Lawful</HI> Actions, which there is to be found in <HI>Unlawful</HI> Ones. The wayes of <HI>Honesty</HI> are plain to men, and they require not so much <HI>Uneasiness</HI> in the Minds of men to manage them. Whereas your <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Cheats,</HI> and men that follow Courses of <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> take wayes that are full of Difficulties: the <HI>Turns</HI> and the <HI>Tricks</HI> with
<PB N="32" REF="001460_0033_0FB349C51F810870"/>
which they must be carried thro' them, are in∣numerable. Hence among such Fellowes, you find the Exercise of the most Extraordinary <HI>Subtilty.</HI> There is no such Cunning, and Nimble <HI>Appli∣cation</HI> to be any where else met withal. Tis very Emphatical, to fetch from hence the colours of <HI>Heavenly Wisdom!</HI> That which I would now be at, is this; That we <HI>Do Good</HI> with as much <HI>Application,</HI> as any men alive can use in <HI>Evil-doing.</HI> When <HI>Wickedness proceeds from the wicked,</HI> it is often done <HI>with both Hands,</HI> and <HI>Greedily.</HI> Why may not we proceed in our <HI>Usefulness,</HI> even <HI>with Both Hands,</HI> and <HI>Greedily</HI> Watching for Opportunities? We have no occasion for any <HI>Ill Arts,</HI> that we may carry on our Designs to <HI>Do Good.</HI> God for∣bid, that we should ever imagine the Uniting of such <HI>Inconsistencies.</HI> But why cannot we carry on our <HI>Designs,</HI> with as much, and as deep, and as copious <HI>Thought,</HI> as the men of <HI>Ill Arts?</HI> And why may not we lay out our Spirits, with as Transporting a Vigour, to Do the Things that will be <HI>Acceptable</HI> to God, and <HI>Profitable</HI> to Men, as any Wretches have, when they <HI>Weary them∣selves to commit Iniquity?</HI> To reprehend cer∣tain Ecclesiastical Drones, who had little Incli∣nation to <HI>Do Good,</HI> Father <HI>Latymer</HI> Employ'd a coarse Expression of this importance; <HI>If you won't Learn of Good Men, for shame Learn of the Devil! He is never Idle. He goes about, seeking what Hurt he may do!</HI> Truly, the Indefatigable Prosecution of their Designs, which we may see

in Some, whom the Holy Word of God has cal∣led, <HI>The Children of the Devil,</HI> may Exceedingly put us to the Blush. Our <HI>Obligations</HI> to <HI>Do Good</HI> are infinite: They <HI>Do Evil</HI> against all <HI>Obli∣gations.</HI> The <HI>Compensations</HI> made unto them who <HI>Do Good,</HI> are Encouraging beyond all Ex∣pression; They who <HI>Do Evil,</HI> get nothing to boast of; but <HI>Evil Pursues the Sinners.</HI> If the <HI>Devil</HI> do <HI>Go about,</HI> and People inspired by him also <HI>Go about, Seeking what Hurt they may do,</HI> Why do not we <HI>Go about,</HI> and <HI>Seek,</HI> and Think, where and How to <HI>Do Good?</HI> Verily, T'were a Cha∣racter for a <HI>Good Angel,</HI> to do so. O Thou <HI>Child of God,</HI> and <HI>Lover of all Righteousness;</HI> How canst thou find in thy Heart at any time to <HI>Cease</HI> from doing all the <HI>Good,</HI> that can be done, in the <HI>Right Wayes of the Lord?</HI> Methinks, That <HI>Word of the Lord,</HI> may be a <HI>Burden</HI> unto us; If we have any true <HI>Honour</HI> in us, it will be so! <HI>The Children of this World, are in</HI> [and, <HI>For,</HI>] <HI>their Generation, Wiser than the Children of Light.</HI> Yea, they Pursue the <HI>Works of Darkness</HI> more Livelily, than any of us <HI>Walk in the Light,</HI> where-with our Great Saviour has favour'd us.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. TO the Title of <HI>Good Works</HI> there do belong, those <HI>Essayes to Do Good,</HI> which are now urged for. To produce them, the <HI>First</HI> Thing, and indeed the ONE Thing, that is <HI>Needful,</HI> is, A Glorious work of <HI>Grace</HI> on the Soul, Renewing and Quickening of it, and <HI>Pu∣rifying</HI> of the Sinner, and rendring him <HI>Zealous of
<PB N="34" REF="001460_0035_0FB349C81FAC1BC8"/>
Good Works:</HI> A <HI>Workmanship of God</HI> upon us, <HI>Crea∣ting</HI> us over again, by JESUS CHRIST, <HI>for Good Works.</HI> And then, there is Needful, what will ne∣cessarily follow upon such a <HI>Work:</HI> That is, A <HI>Disposition</HI> to <HI>Do Good Works</HI> upon true, Genuine, Generous, and Evangelical <HI>Principles.</HI> Those <HI>Principles</HI> are to be <HI>Stated,</HI> before we can go any further; when they are <HI>Active,</HI> we shall go a great deal further.</P>
<P>It is in the first Place, to be taken for granted; That the <HI>End</HI> for which we do <HI>Good Works,</HI> must not be, To afford the Matter of our <HI>Justification,</HI> before the Law of the Holy GOD. Indeed, no <HI>Good Works</HI> can be done by any man until he be <HI>Justified.</HI> Until a Man be United unto the Glo∣rious CHRIST, who is <HI>our Life,</HI> he is a <HI>Dead Man.</HI> And, I Pray, what <HI>Good Works</HI> to be Ex∣pected from Such a Man? They will all be <HI>Dead Works.</HI> For, <HI>Severed from me ye can do nothing,</HI> Saith our Saviour. The <HI>Justification of a</HI> Sinner, <HI>by Faith, Before Good Works, and in Order to them,</HI> is One of those Truths, which may say to the Popish Innovations, <HI>With us are the Gray-headed, and very Aged Men, much Elder than thy Father.</HI> It was an Old Maxim of the Faithful, <HI>Bona opera Sequuntur Justificatum, non praecedunt Justificandum.</HI> It is the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the <HI>Good Works</HI> done by our Saviour and <HI>Surety,</HI> not our own, that <HI>Justi∣fies</HI> us before God, and answers the Demands of His Law upon us. We do by <HI>Faith</HI> lay hold on those <HI>Good Works</HI> for our <HI>Justifying Righteousness</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="001460_0036_0FB349CC594427A8"/>
before we arrive to do our own. Tis not our <HI>Faith</HI> it self, either as doing of <HI>Good Works,</HI> or as being it self one of them, which Entitles us to the <HI>Justifying Righteousness</HI> of our Saviour. But it is <HI>Faith,</HI> only <HI>As</HI> Renouncing of our own Righteous∣ness, &amp; Relying on that of our Saviour, provided for the <HI>Chief of Sinners,</HI> by which we are <HI>Justified.</HI> Sir, All your Attempts at <HI>Good Works</HI> will come to Nothing, till a <HI>Justifying Faith</HI> in your Saviour, shall carry you forth unto them. This was the Divinity of the Ancients; <HI>Jerom</HI> has well Ex∣pressed it; <HI>Sine Christo Omnis Virtus est in Vitio.</HI> Nevertheless; First, You are to Look upon it, as a glorious Truth of the Gospel, That the <HI>Mo∣ral Law</HI> (which prescribes and requires <HI>Good Works</HI>) must by every Christian Alive be made the <HI>Rule</HI> of his Life. <HI>Do we make void the Law thro' Faith? God Forbid. Yea, we Establish the Law.</HI> The <HI>Rule,</HI> by which we are to <HI>Glorify</HI> God is given us in the Law of <HI>Good Works,</HI> which we <HI>En∣joy</HI> [I will Express it <HI>so!</HI>] in the <HI>Ten Command∣ments.</HI> It is impossible for us, to be Released from all Obligations to Glorify God by a con∣formity to this <HI>Rule;</HI> Sooner shall we cease to be Creatures. The <HI>Conformity</HI> to that Rule in the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which our Saviour by His Obedi∣ence to it, has <HI>brought in,</HI> to <HI>Justify</HI> us, has for e∣ver <HI>Magnified the Law, and made it Honourable.</HI> Tho' our Saviour has furnished us, with a per∣fect and spotless <HI>Righteousness,</HI> when His Obedi∣ence to the <HI>Law,</HI> is placed unto our Account;
<PB N="36" REF="001460_0037_0FB349CCA655A4F8"/>
Yet it is a <HI>Sin</HI> for us at all to fall short in our own Obedience to the <HI>Law:</HI> We must alwayes Loathe and Judge our selves for the <HI>Sin.</HI> We are not under the <HI>Law</HI> as a <HI>Covenant of Works.</HI> Our own Exactness in doing of <HI>Good Works,</HI> is not now the <HI>Condition</HI> of our <HI>Entring into Life. We unto us if it were!</HI> But still, the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> holds us to it, as our <HI>Duty;</HI> and if we are in the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> we shall make it our <HI>Study,</HI> to <HI>Do</HI> those <HI>Good Works</HI> which once were the Terms of our <HI>Entring into Life. Manet Lex tota Pietatis;</HI> That was the Divinity in <HI>Tertullians</HI> Dayes! There must be such an Esteem for the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Good Works</HI> retain∣ed for ever in all the <HI>Justifyed:</HI> A <HI>Law</HI> never to be Abrogated; never to be Abolished! And then, Secondly, Tho' we are <HI>Justified</HI> by a <HI>Preci∣ous Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness of God our Saviour,</HI> yet Good Works are demanded of us, to <HI>Justify</HI> our <HI>Faith;</HI> to <HI>Demonstrate,</HI> that it is indeed that <HI>Precious Faith.</HI> A <HI>Justifying Faith</HI> is a <HI>Jewel,</HI> which may be <HI>Counterfeited.</HI> But now the <HI>Marks</HI> of a <HI>Faith,</HI> which is no Counterfeit, are to be found in the <HI>Good Works</HI> whereto a Servant of God is inclined and assisted by his <HI>Faith.</HI> It is by a <HI>Re∣generating Work</HI> of the Holy Spirit, that <HI>Faith</HI> is wrought in the Souls of the chosen People. Now the same <HI>Work</HI> of God, and of <HI>Grace,</HI> which does in a <HI>Regeneration</HI> Dispose a man to make his Flight by <HI>Faith,</HI> unto the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of his only Saviour, will also dispose him to the <HI>Good Works</HI> of a <HI>Christian Life.</HI> And the Same <HI>Faith</HI> which
<PB N="37" REF="001460_0038_0FB349CE242BF6C8"/>
goes to the Saviour for a part in His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> will also go to Him, for an Heart and Strength to do the <HI>Good Works,</HI> which are <HI>Ordained, that we should walk in them.</HI> If Our <HI>Faith</HI> be not such a <HI>Faith,</HI> 'tis a <HI>Lifeless</HI> one, and it will not bring to <HI>Life.</HI> A <HI>Workless Faith</HI> is a <HI>Worthless Faith.</HI> My Friend, Suppose thy self Standing before the <HI>Judgment-Seat</HI> of the Glorious LORD. A Need∣ful, a Prudent, Supposal; it ought to be a very <HI>Frequent</HI> One. The <HI>Judge</HI> demands, <HI>What hast thou to Plead, for a Portion in the Blessedness of the Righteous?</HI> The Plea must be;</P>
<P><HI>O my Glorious Judge, Thou hast been my Sacrifice, Oh! Judge of all the Earth, Give Poor Dust and Ashes Leave to Say, My Righteousness is on the Bench. Surely, In the Lord I have my Righteousness. O my Saviour, I have Received it, I have Secured it, upon thy Gracious offer of it.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Judge</HI> proceeds;</P>
<P><HI>But what hast thou to Plead, That thy Faith should not be Rejected, as the Faith and Hope of the Hypocrite?</HI></P>
<P>Here the Plea must be;</P>
<P><HI>Lord, My Faith was thy Work. It was a Faith which disposed me to all the Good Works of thy Holy Religion. My Faith Sanctified me. It carried me to thee, O my Saviour, for Grace to do the Works of Righteousness. It Embraced thee for my Lord as well as for my Saviour. It caused me with Sincerity to Love and Keep thy Commandments; with assi∣duity to Serve the Interests of thy Kingdom in the World.</HI> Thus you have <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> Reconciled. Thus you have <HI>Good Works</HI> provided for. The Aphorism of the Physician, is, <HI>Per Brachium fit Judicium de corde.</HI> The <HI>Doings</HI> of Men are truer and surer Indications, than all their <HI>Sayings,</HI> of
<PB N="38" REF="001460_0039_0FB349CFD96D8D50"/>
what they are <HI>within.</HI> But there is yet a further Consideration, upon which you must be <HI>Zealously Affected</HI> for them. You must Consider <HI>Good Works,</HI> as the <HI>Way</HI> to, yea, as a <HI>Part</HI> of, the <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> which is Purchased and Intended for you, by your Blessed Saviour. Without an <HI>Holy Heart</HI> you can't be fit for an <HI>Holy Heaven; Meet for the Inheritance of the Holy Ones</HI> in that <HI>Light,</HI> which admits no <HI>works of Darkness;</HI> where none but <HI>Good Works</HI> are done for Eternal Ages. But an <HI>Holy Heart</HI> will cause a man to do <HI>Good works</HI> with all his Heart. The Motto on the Gates of the Holy City is; <HI>None but the Lovers of Good Works to enter here.</HI> Tis im∣plied, in what we read, <HI>Without Holiness no man shall see the Lord.</HI> Yea, to be <HI>Saved</HI> without <HI>Good works,</HI> were to be <HI>Saved</HI> without <HI>Salvation.</HI> Much of our <HI>Salvation</HI> lies in doing of <HI>Good works.</HI> When our <HI>Souls</HI> are <HI>Enlarged</HI> and <HI>Unfetter'd,</HI> it is that we may <HI>Do</HI> such Things. <HI>Heaven</HI> is begun upon <HI>Earth</HI> in the doing of them. Doubtless, no man shall come up to <HI>Heaven,</HI> who is not so per∣swaded. I will mention but one more of those <HI>Principles,</HI> which <HI>Good works</HI> grow upon. Tis that Noble one, of GRATITUDE. The Believer cannot but Enquire, <HI>What shall I render to my Sa∣viour?</HI> The Result of the Enquiry will be, <HI>with Good works to Glorify Him.</HI> We read, <HI>Faith works by Love.</HI> Our <HI>Faith</HI> will first show us the Match∣less and Marvellous <HI>Love</HI> of God, in Saving us. And the <HI>Faith</HI> of this <HI>Love</HI> will work upon our
<PB N="39" REF="001460_0040_0FB349D126994190"/>
Hearts, until it has raised in us, an Unquencha∣ble Flame of <HI>Love</HI> unto Him that hath so <HI>Loved</HI> us, and <HI>Saved</HI> us▪</P>
<P>These, These are to be our Dispositions;</P>
<P><HI>O my Saviour; Hast thou done so much for me? Now will I do all I can for thy Kingdom, and People in the World? Oh! What Service is there that I may now do for my Sa∣viour, and for His People in the World!</HI></P>
<P>These are the Principles to be proceeded on. And on them, I will observe to you a Notable Thing. Tis worthy of Observations, That there are no men in the World, who so abound in <HI>Good works,</HI> as the men who have most of all a∣bandoned all pretence to <HI>Merit</HI> by their <HI>works.</HI> There are <HI>Protestants</HI> who have out-done <HI>Papists,</HI> in our Days, as well as in Dr. <HI>Willets.</HI> No <HI>Merit-Mongers</HI> have gone beyond some Holy Christians, who have done <HI>Good works,</HI> upon the <HI>Assurance</HI> of their being already Justified and Entitled unto Life Eternal.</P>
<P>I take Notice, that our Apostle, casting a Just Contempt on the <HI>Endless Genealogies,</HI> and Long, Intricate, Perplexed Pedigrees, which the <HI>Jews</HI> of his Time, stood so much upon; Proposes in∣stead thereof to be Studied, <HI>Charity, out of a Pure Heart, and a Good Conscience, and Faith Unfeigned.</HI> As if he had said, I will give you a <HI>Genealogy</HI> worth Ten Thousand of theirs, First, From <HI>Faith Unfeigned</HI> proceeds a <HI>Good Conscience:</HI> From a <HI>Good Conscience</HI> proceeds a <HI>Pure Heart:</HI> From a <HI>Pure Heart</HI> proceeds a <HI>Charity</HI> to all about us. Tis Admirably Stated!</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="40" REF="001460_0041_0FB349D3D87039C0"/>§ 8. IT is to be fear'd, That we too seldom <HI>Enquire</HI> after our <HI>Opportunities to Do Good.</HI> Our <HI>Opportunities to Do Good</HI> are our TALENTS. An awful Account must be rendred unto the Great GOD, concerning our Use of the <HI>Talents,</HI> wherewith He has Entrusted us, in these Precious <HI>Opportunities.</HI> We do not <HI>Use</HI> our <HI>Opportunities,</HI> many times because we do not <HI>Know</HI> what they are; and many times, the Reason why we do not <HI>Know,</HI> is be∣cause we do not <HI>Think.</HI> Our <HI>Opportunities to do Good,</HI> ly by Unregarded, and Un-improved; and so 'tis but a mean Account that can be given of them. We <HI>Read</HI> of a thing, which we <HI>Deride</HI> as often as we behold; <HI>There is, that maketh himself Poor, and yet has great Riches.</HI> It is a thing too too frequently Exemplified, in our <HI>Opportunities to Do Good,</HI> which are some of our most Valuable <HI>Riches.</HI> Many a man seems to reckon himself destitute of those <HI>Talents;</HI> as if there were <HI>No∣thing</HI> for him to do: He pretends he is not in a Condition to <HI>Do any Good, Alas! Poor Man; what can he do?</HI> My Friend; <HI>Think</HI> again; <HI>Think</HI> often. <HI>Enquire</HI> what your <HI>Opportunities</HI> are. You will doubtless find them, to be more than you were <HI>Aware</HI> of. <HI>Plain Men dwelling in Tents,</HI> Per∣sons of a very <HI>Ordinary Character,</HI> may in a way of bright Piety, prove Persons of <HI>Extraordinary Usefulness.</HI> A Poor <HI>John Urich</HI> may make a <HI>Gro∣tius</HI> the Better for him. I have read of a Pious
<PB N="41" REF="001460_0042_0FB349D4E076B310"/>
<HI>Weaver,</HI> of whom some Eminent Persons would say, <HI>Christ walked as it were alive upon the Earth in that man.</HI> And a world of <HI>Good</HI> was done by that man. A mean <HI>Mechanick,</HI> who can tell what an <HI>Engine</HI> of <HI>Good,</HI> he may be, if humbly and wisely applied unto it!</P>
<P>This then is the Next PROPOSAL. Without abridging your selves of your <HI>Occasional Thoughts</HI> on the Question, often every Day, <HI>What Good may I do?</HI> State a <HI>Time</HI> now and then for more <HI>Deliberate Thoughts</HI> upon it. Can't you find a <HI>Time,</HI> [Suppose, once a Week, yea, and how a∣greeably, on the <HI>Lord</HI>'s Day,] to take that Question into your Consideration; <HI>What is there that I may do, for the Service of the Glorious Lord, and for the Welfare of those, for whom I ought to be Concerned?</HI> Having implored the <HI>Di∣rection</HI> of God, who is the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> and the Author and Giver of <HI>Good Thoughts, Consider</HI> on the matter, in the various Aspects of it. <HI>Con∣sider</HI> till you have <HI>Resolved</HI> on something. The <HI>Resolutions</HI> which you <HI>take up,</HI> immediately <HI>write down.</HI> Examine what <HI>Precept</HI> and what <HI>Promise,</HI> you can find in the Word of God, that may Countenance the Intentions, in these your <HI>Me∣morials.</HI> Look over the <HI>Memorials</HI> at proper Sea∣sons afterwards, to see how far you have Pro∣ceeded in the Execution of them. The Advan∣tages of these <HI>Reserved</HI> and <HI>Revised <HI>Memori∣als,</HI></HI> no <HI>Rhetorick</HI> will serve to Commend them,
<PB N="42" REF="001460_0043_0FB349D65FA6D438"/>
no <HI>Arithmetick</HI> to Number them. There are some <HI>Animals,</HI> of whom we say, <HI>They do not know their own Strength. Christians,</HI> why should you be <HI>They?</HI></P>
<P N="9">§ 9. LET us descend unto <HI>Particulars.</HI> But in doing so, let it not be imagi∣ned, that I pretend unto an Enumeration of all the <HI>Good Devices,</HI> that are to be thought upon.

A∣mong all the Dispensations of <HI>Special Providence,</HI> in the Government of the World, there is none more <HI>Uninterrupted,</HI> than the Accomplishment of that Word, <HI>Vnto him that hath, shall be given.</HI> I will say this; O <HI>Useful Man,</HI> Take that for thy <HI>Motto;</HI> HABENTI DABITUR: And, in a Lively Use of thy <HI>Opportunities to Do Good,</HI> see how notably, it will be accomplished! Sir, See what Accomplishment of that Word will at last Surprize you; <HI>Tho' thy Beginning were Small, yet thy Latter End shall greatly Increase.</HI></P>
<P N="10">§ 10. <HI>ODI Sapientem qui sibi non sapit.</HI> The <HI>Charity</HI> we are upon, why should it not <HI>Begin at Home?</HI> It observes not a due <HI>De∣corum,</HI> if it do not so; and it will be liable to great Exceptions in its Pretensions and Proceedings.</P>
<P>This then is to be made as an Early PRO∣POSAL.</P>
<P>First, Let every man <HI>Devise</HI> what <HI>Good</HI> may be done, for the Help of what is yet Amiss, <HI>in his own Heart and Life.</HI> It is a Good Note of the Witty <HI>Fullers; He need not Complain of too little work, who hath a Little World in himself to
<PB N="44" REF="001460_0045_0FB349D95FFDC608"/>
Mend.</HI> It was of old Complained; <HI>No man Re∣pented him, saying, What have I done?</HI> Every man upon Earth may find in himself something that wants Mending; and the Work of <HI>Repentance</HI> is to Enquire, not only, <HI>What we have done,</HI> but also, <HI>What we have to do?</HI> Frequent <HI>Self-Exami∣nation,</HI> is the Duty and the Prudence, of all that would <HI>Know themselves,</HI> or would not <HI>Lose themselves.</HI> The Great Intention of <HI>Self-Exa∣mination</HI> is, to find out, the Points, wherein we are to, <HI>Amend our wayes.</HI> A Christian that would thrive in Christianity, must be no Stran∣ger to a Course of <HI><HI>Meditation.</HI> Meditation,</HI> Tis one of the <HI>Masters</HI> to make a <HI>Man of God.</HI> One Article and Exercise in our <HI>Meditation,</HI> should be, to find out, the Things wherein a Greater <HI>Conformity</HI> to the <HI>Truths</HI> upon which we have been Meditating, must be Endeavoured. If we would be <HI>Good Men,</HI> we must often <HI>Devise,</HI> How we may grow in <HI>Knowledge, and in all Good∣ness!</HI> It is an Enquiry often to be made;</P>
<P><HI>What shall I do, that what is yet Lacking in the Image of God upon me, may be Perfected? What shall I do, that I may Live more Perfectly, more Watchfully, more Fruitfully before the Glorious Lord?</HI></P>
<P>And why should not our <HI>Meditation,</HI> when we Retire to that <HI>Soul-Enriching</HI> Work of Shaping the <HI>Right Thoughts of the Righteous,</HI> Expire with some <HI>Resolution's Devise</HI> now, and <HI>Resolve</HI> something, to strengthen your <HI>Walk with God.</HI></P>
<P>With some Devout <HI>Hearers</HI> of the Word, it is a
<PB N="45" REF="001460_0046_0FB349DB4C6848E8"/>
Practice, when they have Heard a Sermon, to think; <HI>What Good thing have I now to ask of God, with a special Importunity?</HI> Yea, they use to call upon their <HI>Children</HI> also, and make them answer this Question: <HI>Child, What Blessing will you now ask of the Glorious God?</HI> And Charge them then to go, and do accordingly.</P>
<P>In pursuance of this Piety, why may not this be one of the Exercises, that shall go to make with us a <HI>Good Evening for the Best of Days?</HI> On the <HI>Lords-Day Evening,</HI> we may make this one of our Exercises; To Employ most serious and awful Thoughts on that Question; <HI>Should I Dy this Week, what have I left Undone, which I should then wish I had made more speed in the doing of?</HI> My Friend, Place thy self in <HI>Dying</HI> Circumstances; Apprehend and Realize thy Approaching <HI>Death.</HI> Suppose thy Last Hour come; the <HI>Decretory Hour:</HI> thy Breath failing, thy Throat rattling, thy Hands with a cold Sweat upon them, only the turn of the Tide expected for thy Expiration. In this Condition; <HI>What wouldest thou wish to have done, more than thou hast already done, for thy own Soul, for thy Family, or for the People of God?</HI> Think; Don't <HI>Forget</HI> the Result of thy Thoughts; Don't <HI>Delay</HI> to do what thou hast Resolved upon. How much more Agreeable and Profitable, would such an Exercise be on the <HI>Lords-Day Evening,</HI> than those Vanities whereto that <HI>Evening</HI> is too com∣monly Prostituted, and all the <HI>Good</HI> of the fore∣going <HI>Day</HI> Defeated? And if such an Exercise
<PB N="46" REF="001460_0047_0FB349DC5E4D3B90"/>
were often attended, Oh! How much would it Regulate our Lives; how Watchfully, how Fruit∣fully would it cause us to Live; What an in∣credible Number of <HI>Good Works</HI> would it produce in the World?</P>
<P>Will you Remember, Sirs, Every Christian is, <HI>A Temple of God.</HI> It would be a Service to Chri∣stianity, if this Notion of Christianity were more often, and clearly Cultivated. But cer∣tainly, there yet remains very much, for every one of us to do, that so the <HI>Temple</HI> may be car∣ried on unto Perfection; Repaired, Finished, Pu∣rified; and the Top-stone of it Laid, with a Shout of <HI>Grace! Grace!</HI> unto it.</P>
<P>As a Branch of this Piety, I will recommend, a serious and fruitful Improvement, of the Va∣rious <HI>Dispensations,</HI> which the Divine Providence obliges us, to take notice of.</P>
<P>More Particularly;</P>
<P>Have you received any <HI>special Blessings,</HI> and <HI>Mercies,</HI> from the Hand of a Merciful God? You do not suitably Express your Thankfulness; You do not <HI>render again according to the Benefit that is done unto you;</HI> Except you set your self to Consider, <HI>What shall I render to the Lord?</HI> You should Contrive some <HI>Signal Thing</HI> to be done on this Occasion; Some <HI>Service</HI> to the Kingdom of God, Either within your self, or among others, that may be a just Confession and Remembrance of what a Good God has done for you. Tis what the <HI>Goodness of God leads</HI> you to! I beseech
<PB N="47" REF="001460_0048_0FB349DDDFD74A78"/>
you, Sirs; How can a <HI>Good Voyage,</HI> yea, or a <HI>Good Bargain</HI> be made, without some <HI>Special Returns</HI> of <HI>Gratitude</HI> unto God? I would now, have some∣thing of your <HI>Estates</HI> made a <HI>Thank-Offering,</HI> in be∣ing Set apart for <HI>Pious Uses.</HI></P>
<P>Whole <HI>Days of Thanksgiving</HI> are to be kept, when the Favours of God rise to a more observable Heighth. Christians of the Finer Mould, keep their <HI>Private</HI> ones, their <HI>Secret</HI> ones, as well as bear their part in the <HI>Publick.</HI> One Exercise for such a Day, is, To take a <HI>List</HI> of the more distinguishable Suc∣cours, and Bounties, wherewith our God has com∣forted us. And then, to contrive Some <HI>Notable Ac∣knowledgments</HI> of the Glorious Lord, in Endea∣vours to Serve Him, and this by way of <HI>Gratitude</HI> for these Undeserved Comforts.</P>
<P>On the other hand. You meet with heavy and grievous <HI>Afflictions.</HI> Verily, Tis Pitty to be at the Trouble of Suffering <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and not <HI>get Good</HI> by them. We <HI>get Good</HI> by them, when they awaken us to <HI>Do Good.</HI> I may say, Never till then! When God is <HI>Distributing Sorrows</HI> unto you, the <HI>Sorrows</HI> come still upon some <HI>Errands:</HI> The best way for you to find, that they do not come <HI>in His Anger,</HI> is for you to Mind the <HI>Er∣rands.</HI> The Advice is, That when any <HI>Affliction</HI> comes upon you, You immediately consider, <HI>What Special Article of Repentance does this Affliction call me to? What Miscarriage does this Affliction find in me, to be Repented of?</HI> And then, while the sense of the <HI>Affliction</HI> is yet upon you, Sollicitous∣ly
<PB N="48" REF="001460_0049_0FB349DFF024E3E0"/>
Consider, <HI>What Improvement in Godliness and Usefulness does this Affliction call me to?</HI> Be more Sollicitous to Gain this point, than to Get out of your <HI>Affliction.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Peace</HI> that will com∣pose and Possess and Ravish your Minds, when your <HI>Affliction</HI> shall be found yielding the <HI>Fruits of Righteousness!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Luther</HI> did well to call Afflictions, <HI>Theologiam Christianorum.</HI> This may be a fit Place, to intro∣duce One Direction more. We are Travelling thro' a <HI>Malicious</HI> and <HI>Calumnious,</HI> and <HI>Abusive</HI> World. Why should not <HI>Malice</HI> be a <HI>Good In∣former?</HI> We may be unjustly <HI>Defamed;</HI> it will be Strange if we are not Frequently so. A <HI>De∣famation</HI> is commonly Resented as a <HI>Provocation.</HI> My Friend, Make it only a <HI>Provocation to Good Works!</HI> The Thing to be now directed is this. Upon any <HI>Reproach,</HI> instead of being transported into a Rage at <HI>Shimei,</HI> Retire, and Patiently Ponder, <HI>Has not God hidden such a Reproach, to awaken me unto some Duty? Unto what special Instance or Service of Piety, should I be awakened, by the Reproach that is cast upon me!</HI> One thus Expresses it. <HI>The Backbiters Tongue, like a Mill-clack will be still Wag∣ging, that he may Grind thy Good Name to Powder. Learn therefore to make such use of his Clack as to make thy Bread by it; I mean, To live so, that no Credit shall be given to Slander.</HI> Thus all the <HI>Abuses</HI> you meet withal, may prove unto you in the Hand of a Faithful God, no other than the Strokes which a Statuary Employes on his Ill-Shaped
<PB N="49" REF="001460_0050_0FB349E0DF6385C0"/>
Marble; only to form you into a more beautiful Shape, and make you fitter to adorn the Heavenly Temple. Sirs, you are put into, a way to <HI>shake off a Viper,</HI> how advantageously!</P>
<P>Yea, I am going to show you, how you may <HI>fetch a Treacle out of a Viper. Austin</HI> would have our very <HI>Sins,</HI> come into the Invoyse of the, <HI>All Things,</HI> that are to <HI>Work together for Good.</HI> Where∣fore, first, I move, That our former <HI>Barrenness</HI> may now be Look'd upon, as our Obligation and Incitation to a Greater <HI>Fruitfulness.</HI> But this motion is too general. I will descend unto a notable Particularity. I would look back, up∣on my past Life, and call to Mind what more <HI>Singular Cut-breakings of Sin</HI> have blemished it, and been the <HI>Reproach of my Youth.</HI> Now, by way of <HI>Thankfulness</HI> for that <HI>Grace</HI> of God, and that <HI>Blood</HI> of His <HI>Christ,</HI> thro' which my <HI>Crimes</HI> have been Pardoned, I would Set my self to think, <HI>What Vertues, and what Actions, and what Atchieve∣ments for the Kingdom of God, will be the most contrary to my former Blemishes? And what Efforts of Good∣ness, will be the noblest and most palpable contradiction to the Miscarriages, with which I have been Chargea∣ble?</HI> Yet more particularly, <HI>What Signal thing shall I do, to Save Others from Dishonouring the Great God by such Miscarriages, as I my self once fell into.</HI> I will Study such Things. Perhaps, the Since∣rity and Consolation of <HI>Repentance,</HI> cannot be bet∣ter Studied, than by such a conduct.</P>
<P>You shall give me leave, to press this one
<PB N="50" REF="001460_0051_0FB349E25FC57410"/>
more <HI>Point of Prudence</HI> upon you. There are not a few Persons, who have many <HI>Hours of Liesure</HI> in the way of their <HI>Personal Callings.</HI> When the <HI>Weather</HI> takes them off their Business, or when their <HI>Shops</HI> are not full of Customers, they have <HI>Little</HI> or <HI>Nothing</HI> to do; Now, Sirs, the PROPO∣SAL is, <HI>Be not Fools,</HI> but <HI>Redeem</HI> this <HI>Time</HI> to your own Advantage, to the best Advantage. To the <HI>Man of Liesure,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Minister,</HI> it is an Advice of Wisdom, <HI>Give thy self unto Read∣ing.</HI> Good <HI>Books</HI> of all Sorts, may Employ your <HI>Liesure,</HI> and Enrich you with Treasures more valuable, than those, which the way and Work of your Callings would have purchased. Let the baneful <HI>Thoughts of Idleness</HI> be chased out of our Minds. But then also, Let Some Thoughts on that Subject, <HI>What Good may I do?</HI> come into them. When you have <HI>Liesure</HI> to think on that Subject, you can have no <HI>Excuse</HI> for not thinking on it.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. THE <HI>Useful Man</HI> may now with a very good Grace, Extend and Enlarge the <HI>Sphere</HI> of his consideration. My next PRO∣POSAL now shall be; Let every Man consider the <HI>Relation,</HI> wherein the Soveraign God has placed him, and let him <HI>Devise what Good he may do,</HI> that may render his <HI>Relatives,</HI> the Better for him. One Great way to prove our selves <HI>Really Good,</HI> is to be <HI>Relatively Good.</HI> By This, more than by any thing in the World, it is, that we <HI>Adorn
<PB N="51" REF="001460_0052_0FB349E49E89DF00"/>
the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</HI> It would be an <HI>Excellent Wisdom</HI> in a man, to make the <HI>Interest</HI> he has in the Good Opinion and Affection of <HI>any One,</HI> an <HI>Advantage</HI> to do Good Service for God upon them: He that <HI>has a Friend</HI> will show himself indeed <HI>Friendly,</HI> if he think, <HI>Such an One Loves me, and will hearken to me; what Good shall I take advantage hence to perswade him to?</HI></P>
<P>This will take place more particularly, where the Endearing Ties of <HI>Natural Relation</HI> do give us an <HI>Interest.</HI> Let us call over our several <HI>Re∣lations,</HI> and let us have <HI>Devices</HI> of Something that may be called <HI>Heroical Goodness,</HI> in our Discharg∣ing of them. Why should we not, at least Once or Twice in a <HI>Week,</HI> make this <HI>Relational Good∣ness,</HI> the Subject of our <HI>Enquiries,</HI> and our <HI>Purpo∣ses?</HI> Particularly, Let us begin with our <HI>Do∣mestick Relations;</HI> and <HI>Provide for those of our own House;</HI> Lest we <HI>Deny</HI> some Glorious Rules and Hopes of our Christian <HI>Faith,</HI> in our Negligence.</P>
<P>First; In the <HI>Conjugal Relation,</HI> how agreeably may the <HI>Consorts</HI> think on those Words; <HI>What knowest thou, O Wife, whether thou shalt Save thy Husband? Or, How knowest thou, O Man, whe∣ther thou shalt Save thy Wife?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Husband</HI> will do well to think; <HI>What shall I do, that my Wife may have cause for ever to Bless God, for bringing her unto me?</HI> And, <HI>What shall I do that in my Carriage towards my Wife, the Kindness of the Blessed</HI> JESUS <HI>towards His Church, may be followed and resembled?</HI> That this Questi∣on
<PB N="52" REF="001460_0053_0FB349E62288BA90"/>
may be the more perfectly answered, Sir, Sometimes ask her to help you in the Answer; Ask her to tell you, what she would have you to do.</P>
<P>But then, the <HI>Wife</HI> also will do well to think; <HI>Wherein may I be to my Husband, a Wife of that Character;</HI> She will do him Good, and not Evil, all the Dayes of his Life?</P>
<P>With my <HI>Married People,</HI> I will particularly leave a Good Note, which I find in the Memo∣rials of <HI>Gervase Disney</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Family-Passions, cloud Faith, disturb Duty, darken Comfort.</HI> You'l do the more Good unto one another, the more this Note is thought upon. When the <HI>Husband</HI> and <HI>Wife</HI> are alwayes contriving to be <HI>Blessings</HI> unto one another, I will say with <HI>Tertullian, Unde Suf∣ficiam ad Enarrandam faelicitatem Ejus Matrimonii!</HI> O Happy Marriage!</P>
<P><HI>Parents,</HI> Oh! How much ought you to be continually <HI>Devising,</HI> and even <HI>Travailing,</HI> for the <HI>Good</HI> of your <HI>Children.</HI> Often <HI>Devise;</HI> How to make them <HI>Wise Children;</HI> How to carry on a Desireable <HI>Education</HI> for them; an <HI>Education</HI> that shall render them Desireable; How to ren∣der them Lovely, and Polite Creatures, and <HI>Serviceable</HI> in their Generation. Often <HI>Devise,</HI> How to Enrich their Minds with Valuable <HI>Knowledge;</HI> How to Instil Generous, and Graci∣ous, and Heavenly <HI>Principles</HI> into their Minds; How to Restrain and Rescue them from the <HI>Patches of the Destroyer,</HI> and fortify them against
<PB N="53" REF="001460_0054_0FB349E79FC84E88"/>
their <HI>Special Temptations.</HI> There is a World of <HI>Good,</HI> that you have to Do for them. You are without <HI>Bowels,</HI> Oh! be not such <HI>Monsters!</HI> if you are not in a continual Agony to do for them all the <HI>Good</HI> that ever you can. It was no mistake of <HI>Pacatus Drepanius</HI> in his Panegyric to <HI>Theodosius; Instituente Natura Plus fere Filios quam nosmetipsos diligimus.</HI></P>
<P>I will Prosecute this Matter, by Transcribing a Copy of PARENTAL RESOLUTIONS, which I have some-where met withal.</P>
<Q><P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> At the Birth of my Children, I would use all <HI>Explicit Solemnity</HI> in the <HI>Baptismal</HI> Dedicati∣on and Consecration of them unto the LORD. I would present them to the BAPTISM of the Lord, not as a meer Formality; but won∣dring at the Grace of the Infinite GOD, who will accept <HI>my</HI> Children, as <HI>His,</HI> I would Re∣solve to do all I can that they may be <HI>His.</HI> I would now actually Give them up unto GOD; Entreating, that the Child may be a <HI>Child</HI> of God the <HI>Father,</HI> a <HI>Subject</HI> of God the <HI>Son,</HI> a Temple of God the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and be rescued from the Condition of a <HI>Child of Wrath,</HI> and be Pos∣sessed and Employed by the Lord as an Ever∣lasting Instrument of His Glory.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> My Children are no sooner grown capa∣ble of Minding the Admonitions, but I would often, often Admonish them to be sensible of their <HI>Baptismal Engagements</HI> to be the Lords. Often tell them, of their <HI>Baptism,</HI> and of what
<PB N="54" REF="001460_0055_0FB349E99F599E98"/>
it binds 'em to: Oftner far, and more times than there were <HI>Drops of water,</HI> that were cast on the Infant, upon that occasion!</P>
<P><HI>Often say to them,</HI> Child, You have been Baptised; You were washed in the Name of the Great God; Now you must not Sin against Him; To Sin is to do a Dirty, a Filthy thing. <HI>Say,</HI> Child, You must every Day cry to God that He would be your Father, and your Saviour, and your Leader; In your Baptism He Promised that He wou'd be so, if you Sought unto Him. <HI>Say,</HI> Child, You must Re∣nounce the Service of Satan, You must not follow the Vani∣ties of this World, you must Lead a Life of Serious Religi∣on; In your Baptism you were bound unto the Service of your only Saviour. <HI>Tell the Child;</HI> What is your Name; you must sooner Forget this Name, that was given you in your Baptism, than forget that you are a Servant of a Glorious Christ whose Name was put upon you in your Baptism.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Let my <HI>Prayers</HI> for my <HI>Children</HI> be Daily, with Constancy, with Fervency, with Agony; Yea, <HI>By Name</HI> let me mention each One of them, every Day before the Lord. I would Importunately Beg for all Suitable Blessings to be bestow'd upon them; That God would <HI>Give them Grace, and give them Glory, and withold no Good Thing from them;</HI> That God would <HI>Smile on their Education, and give His Good Angels the charge over them, and keep them from Evil, that it may not grieve them;</HI> That when <HI>their Father and Mother shall forsake them, the Lord may take them up.</HI> with Importunity I would plead that Promise on their behalf; <HI>The Heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit unto them that Ask Him.</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="001460_0056_0FB349EAA26F9CE0"/>
Oh! Happy Children, If by <HI>Asking</HI> I may ob∣tain the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> for them!</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> I would betimes entertain the Children, with Delightful <HI>Stories</HI> out of the Bible. In the Talk of the <HI>Table,</HI> I would go thro' the <HI>Bible,</HI> when the <HI>Olive-Plants about my Table</HI> are capa∣ble of being so <HI>Watered.</HI> But I would alwayes conclude the <HI>Stories</HI> with some <HI>Lessons</HI> of Piety, to be inferred from them.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> I would Single out Some <HI>Scriptural Sen∣tences,</HI> of the greatest Importance; and Some also that have <HI>Special Antidotes</HI> in them against the Common Errors and Vices of Children.

I will then assign them such <HI>Books</HI> to <HI>Read,</HI> as I may judge most agreeable and profitable; obliging them to give me some Account of what they <HI>Read;</HI> but keep a Strict Eye upon them, that they don't Stumble on <HI>the Devils Library,</HI> and poison themselves with foolish <HI>Romances,</HI> or <HI>Novels,</HI> or <HI>Playes,</HI> or <HI>Songs,</HI> or <HI>Jests that are not convenient.</HI> I will set them also, to <HI>Write</HI> out such things, as may be of the greatest Benefit unto them; and they shall have their Blank Books, neatly kept on purpose, to Enter such Passages as I advise them to. I will particularly require them now and then, to <HI>Write</HI> a <HI>Prayer</HI> of their own Composing, and bring it unto me; that so I may discern, what sense they have of their own Everlasting Interests.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>X.</HI> I Wish that my <HI>Children</HI> may as soon as may be, feel the Principles of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> working in them, and that I may carry on their Education, very much upon those Princi∣ples. Therefore, first, I will wholly avoid, that harsh, fierce, crabbed usage of the Children,
<PB N="59" REF="001460_0060_0FB349F0CD0E1E08"/>
that would make them Tremble, and Abhor to come into my Presence. I will so use them, that they shall <HI>fear</HI> to offend me, and yet migh∣tily <HI>Love</HI> to see me, and be glad of my coming home, if I have been abroad at any time. I would have it Look'd upon as a Severe and Awful <HI>Punishment</HI> for a crime in the Family, To be <HI>forbidden for a while to come into my Pre∣sence.</HI> I would raise in them, an High Opinion of their Fathers <HI>Love</HI> to them, and of his being <HI>better able</HI> to Judge what is Good for them, than they are for themselves. I would bring them to Believe, <HI>Tis best for them to be and do as I would have them.</HI> Hereupon I would continu∣ally Magnify the matter to them, What a brave thing 'tis to <HI>Know</HI> the things that are Excel∣lent; and more brave to <HI>Do</HI> the things that are Vertuous. I would have them to propose it as a <HI>Reward</HI> of their Well-doing at any time, <HI>I will now go to my Father, and he will teach me something that I was never taught before.</HI> I would have them afraid of doing any <HI>Base</HI> Thing, from an horrour of the <HI>Baseness</HI> in it. My first Animadversion on a Lesser Fault in them, shall be a <HI>Surprise,</HI> a <HI>Wonder,</HI> vehemently Express'd before them, that ever they should be guilty of doing so foolishly; a vehement <HI>Belief,</HI> that they will never do the like again; a Weeping Resolution in them, that they will not. I will never dispense a <HI>Blow,</HI> except it be for an atro∣cious Crime or for a lesser Fault Obstinately
<PB N="60" REF="001460_0061_0FB349F21DD96B20"/>
persisted in; either for an Enormity, or for an <HI>Obstinacy.</HI> I would ever <HI>Proportion</HI> chastisements unto Miscarriages; not Smite bitterly for a very small piece of <HI>Childishness,</HI> and only frown a little for some real <HI>Wickedness.</HI> Nor shall my <HI>Chastisements</HI> ever be dispensed in a <HI>Passion</HI> and a <HI>Fury;</HI> but with them, I will first show them the Command of GOD, by Transgressing whereof they have displeased me. The Slavish, Raving, Fighting way of Education too Com∣monly used, I look upon it, as a considerable Article in the Wrath and Curse of God, upon a miserable World.</P>
<P N="11"><HI>XI.</HI> As soon as we can, weel' get up to yet <HI>Higher Principles.</HI> I will often tell the <HI>Children,</HI> What cause they have to <HI>Love</HI> a Glorious <HI>CHRIST,</HI> who has <HI>Dy'd</HI> for them. And, How much He will be <HI>Well-pleased</HI> with their <HI>Well-doing.</HI> And, what a Noble Thing, 'tis to follow His <HI>Example;</HI> which <HI>Example</HI> I will describe unto them. I will often tell them, That the <HI>Eye of God</HI> is up∣on them; the Great GOD Knowes all they do, and Hears all they Speak. I will often tell them, That there will be a Time, when they must appear before the <HI>Judgment-Seat</HI> of the Holy LORD; and they must <HI>Now</HI> do nothing, that may <HI>Then</HI> be a Grief &amp; Shame unto them. I will Set before them, The Delights of that <HI>Heaven</HI> that is prepar'd for Pious Children; and the Torments of that <HI>Hell</HI> that is prepared of old, for naughty ones. I will inform them, Of
<PB N="61" REF="001460_0062_0FB349F39FBF0F58"/>
the <HI>Good Offices</HI> which the <HI>Good Angels</HI> do for <HI>Little Ones</HI> that have the Fear of God, and are afraid of Sin. And, how the <HI>Devils</HI> tempt them to do Ill Things; how they hearken to the <HI>Devils,</HI> and are like <HI>them,</HI> when they do such things; and what mischiefs the <HI>Devils</HI> may get leave to do them in this World, and what a Sad thing t'wil be, to be among the <HI>Devils</HI> in the <HI>Place of Dragons.</HI> I will cry to God, That He <HI>will make them feel the Power of these Principles.</HI></P>
<P N="12"><HI>XII.</HI> When the <HI>Children</HI> are of a Fit Age for it, I will sometimes <HI>Closet</HI> them; have them with me <HI>Alone;</HI> Talk with them about the State of their Souls; their <HI>Experiences,</HI> their <HI>Proficien∣cies,</HI> their <HI>Temptations;</HI> obtain their Declared Consent unto every Stroke in the <HI>Covenant of Grace;</HI> and then Pray with them, and Weep unto the Lord for His <HI>Grace,</HI> to be bestow'd up∣on them, and make them Witnesses of the Ago∣ny with which I am <HI>Travailing</HI> to see the I∣mage of CHRIST formed in them. Certain∣ly, They'l never forget such Actions!</P>
<P N="13"><HI>XIII.</HI> I would be very Watchful and Cauti∣ous, about the <HI>Companions</HI> of my <HI>Children.</HI> I will be very Inquisitive, what <HI>Company</HI> they keep; If they are in hazard of being Ensnared by any <HI>Vicious Company,</HI> I will earnestly pull them out of it, as <HI>Brands out of the Burning.</HI> I will find out, and procure, <HI>Laudable Companion:</HI> for them.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>XIV.</HI> As in <HI>Catechising</HI> the Children, so in the
<PB N="62" REF="001460_0063_0FB349F52463A4B0"/>
<HI>Repetition</HI> of the Publick Sermons, I would use this Method. I will put every <HI>Truth</HI> into a <HI>Question,</HI> to be answered still, with, <HI>Yes,</HI> or, <HI>No.</HI> By this Method, I hope to Awaken their <HI>Atten∣tion</HI> as well as Enlighten their <HI>Understanding.</HI> And thus I shall have an Opportunity to ask, <HI>Do you Desire such or such a Grace of God?</HI> and the like. Yea, I may have Opportunity to De∣mand, and Perhaps to <HI>Obtain</HI> their Early, and Frequent, and why not <HI>Sincere? Consent</HI> unto the glorious Articles of the <HI>New Covenant.</HI> The <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> may fall upon them in this Action; and they may be Siez'd by Him, and Held as His <HI>Temples,</HI> thro' Eternal Ages.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>XV.</HI> When a Day of <HI>Humiliation</HI> arrives, I will make them know the <HI>Meaning</HI> of the Day. And after Time given them to consider of it, I will order them to tell me; <HI>What Special Af∣flictions they have met withal?</HI> And, <HI>What Good they hope to get by those Afflictions?</HI> On a Day of <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> they shall also be made to know the <HI>Intent</HI> of the Day. And after consi∣deration, they shall tell me, <HI>What Mercies of God unto them they take Special Notice of:</HI> And, <HI>What Duties to God, they Confess and Resolve, under such Obligations?</HI> Indeed, For Something of this Importance, to be pursued in my Conversati∣on with the Children, I would not confine my self unto the <HI>Solemn Dayes,</HI> which may occur too seldom for it. Very particularly, when the <HI>Birth-dayes</HI> of the Children anniversarily
<PB N="63" REF="001460_0064_0FB349F6A34F1000"/>
arrive to any of them, I would then take them aside, and mind them of the <HI>Age,</HI> which <HI>having obtained Help from God</HI> they are come unto; How <HI>Thankful</HI> they should be for the Mercies of God, which they have hitherto Liv'd upon; How <HI>Fruitful</HI> they should be in all Goodness, that so they may still enjoy their Mercies. And I would enquire of them, whether they have ever yet Begun to Mind the <HI>Work</HI> which God sent them into the World upon? How far they understand the work; And what Good Strokes they have Struck at it? And, How they design to Spend the Rest of their Time, if God still continue them in the World?</P>

<P N="17"><HI>XVII.</HI> I incline, that among all the Points of a Polite Education which I would endeavour for my <HI>Children,</HI> they may each of them, the <HI>Daughters</HI> as well as the <HI>Sons,</HI> have so much In∣sight into some <HI>Skill,</HI> which lies in the way of <HI>Gain,</HI> (the <HI>Limners,</HI> or the <HI>Seriveners,</HI> or the

<HI>Apothecaries,</HI> or Some other <HI>Mystery,</HI> to which their own Inclination may most carry them,) that they may be able to Subsist themselves, and get something of a Livelihood, in case the Pro∣vidence of God should bring them into Neces∣sities. Why not they as well as, <HI>Paul the Tent-Maker!</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> of the best Fashion, may have occasion to bless the Parents, that make such a Provision for them! The Jews have a Saying; Tis worth my Remembring it. <HI>Qui∣cunque Filium suum non docet opificium, perinde est ac si eum doceret Latrocinium.</HI></P>
<P N="18"><HI>XVIII.</HI> As soon as ever I can, I would make my Children apprehensive of the main END, for which they are to <HI>Live;</HI> that so they may as soon as may be, <HI>begin to Live;</HI> and their <HI>Youth</HI> not be nothing but <HI>Vanity.</HI> I would show them, that their main END must be, <HI>To Ac∣knowledge the Great</HI> GOD, <HI>and His Glorious</HI> CHRIST; <HI>and bring Others to Acknowledge Him:</HI> And that they are never <HI>Wise</HI> nor <HI>Well,</HI> but when they are doing so. I would show them, what the <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> are, and how they are to be made. I would make them able to Answer the Grand Question, <HI>Why they Live; and what is the End of the Actions that fill their Lives?</HI> Teach them, How their <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Redeemer</HI> is to be Obey'd in every thing; and, How every thing is to be done in <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him; Teach them, How even their <HI>Diversions,</HI> and their <HI>Ornaments,</HI> and the <HI>Tasks</HI> of their Education,
<PB N="65" REF="001460_0066_0FB349FAD1737FB0"/>
must all be to fit them for the <HI>further Service</HI> of Him, to whom I have devoted them; and how in these also, His Commandments must be the Rule of all they do. I would sometimes there∣fore Surprize them with an Enquiry, <HI>Child, What is this for? Give me a Good Account, Why you do it?</HI> How comfortably shall I see them <HI>Walk∣ing in the Light,</HI> if I may bring them <HI>Wisely</HI> to answer this Enquiry; and what <HI>Children of the Light?</HI></P>
<P N="19"><HI>XIX.</HI> I would oblige the <HI>Children,</HI> to Retire sometimes, and Ponder on that Question; <HI>What shall I wish to have done, if I were now a dying?</HI> And Report unto me, their <HI>own Answer</HI> to the Question; Of which I would then take Ad∣vantage, to inculcate the <HI>Lessons of Godliness</HI> up∣on them. I would also Direct them and Ob∣lige them, at a proper Time for it, Seriously to Realize, their own Appearance before the awful <HI>Judgment-Seat</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Consider, <HI>What they have to Plead, that they may not be sent away into Everlast∣ing Punishment? What they have to Plead, that they may be Admitted into the Holy City?</HI> I would instruct them, What <HI>Plea</HI> to prepare; First, Show them, how to get a part in the <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> of Him that is to be their <HI>Judge;</HI> by Re∣ceiving it with a Thankful <HI>Faith,</HI> as the <HI>Gift</HI> of infinite Grace unto the Distressed and Unwor∣thy Sinner: Then, Show them how to prove that their <HI>Faith</HI> is not a counterfeit, by their

continual Endeavour to please Him in all things, who is to be their <HI>Judge,</HI> and to Serve His King∣dom and Interest in the World. And I would charge them, to make this preparation.</P>
<P N="20"><HI>XX.</HI> If I Live to see the Children <HI>Mar∣riageable,</HI> I would, before I consult with Heaven and Earth for their best Accom∣modation in the <HI>Married State,</HI> Endeavour the <HI>Espousal</HI> of their Souls unto their only <HI>Saviour.</HI> I would as plainly, and as fully as I can, propose unto them, the Terms on which the Glorious Redeemer would <HI>Espouse</HI> them to Himself, <HI>in Righteousness and Judgment, and Fa∣vour, and Mercies for ever;</HI> and Sollicit their Consent unto His Proposals and Overtures.

<P>From these <HI>Parental Resolutions,</HI> how <HI>Naturally,</HI> how <HI>Reasonably</HI> may we pass on to Say?</P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI> The <HI>Fifth Commandment</HI> confirms all your other Numberless and Powerful Obliga∣tions, often to <HI>Devise, Wherein may I be a Blessing to my Parents?

<P><HI>Masters,</HI> Yea, and <HI>Mistresses</HI> too, must have their <HI>Devices, How to Do Good unto their Ser∣vants;</HI> How to make them the <HI>Servants</HI> of Christ, and the <HI>Children</HI> of God. God whom you must Remember to be <HI>Your Master in Heaven,</HI> has brought them, and put them into your Hands. Who can tell what <HI>Good</HI> He has brought them for? How if they should be the <HI>Elect</HI> of God, fetch'd from <HI>Africa,</HI> or the <HI>Indies,</HI> and brought into your Families, on purpose, that by the means of their being <HI>There,</HI> they may be brought home unto the <HI>Shepherd of Souls?</HI> Oh! That the <HI>Souls</HI> of our <HI>Slaves,</HI> were of more Account with us! That we gave a better Demonstration that we <HI>Despise not our own Souls,</HI> by doing what we can for the <HI>Souls</HI> of our <HI>Slaves,</HI> and not using them as if they had no <HI>Souls!</HI> That the poor <HI>Slaves</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> which Live with us, may by our means be made the

<P>I have somewhere met with a Paper under this Title, The RESOLUTION of a MASTER; which may here afford an agreeable Paragraph and Parenthesis.</P>
<Q><P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> I would always Remember, that my <HI>Servants</HI> are in some sort my <HI>Children.</HI> In a Care, <HI>That they may want nothing that may be good for them,</HI> I would make them as my <HI>Children.</HI> And, as far as the <HI>Methods of Instilling Piety,</HI> which I use with my <HI>Children,</HI> may be Properly and Prudently used with these, they shall be Partakers in them. Nor will I leave them Ignorant of any thing, wherein I may <HI>Instruct</HI> them to be useful in their Generation.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> I will see that my <HI>Servants</HI> be furnished with <HI>Bibles,</HI> and Able and Careful to <HI>Read</HI> the <HI>Lively Ora∣cles.</HI> I will put both <HI>Bibles</HI> and other Good and Fit Books into their Hands; and allow them <HI>Time</HI> to <HI>Read,</HI> but assure my self that they don't <HI>Mispend</HI> this Time. If I can discover any <HI>Wicked Books</HI> in their Hands, I will take away from them, those Pestilential <HI>Instruments of Wickedness.</HI> They shall also <HI>Write</HI> as well as <HI>Read,</HI> if I can bring them to it. And I will set them now and then such Things to <HI>Write,</HI> as may be for their greatest Advantage.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> I will have my <HI>Servants</HI> present at the Religi∣ous Exercises of my <HI>Family;</HI> and let fall either in the <HI>Speeches,</HI> or in the <HI>Prayers,</HI> of the <HI>Daily Sacrifice</HI> in the Family, such Passages, as may have a Tendency to quicken a Sense of Religion in them.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> The <HI>Catechising</HI> Stroke as far as the <HI>Age</HI> or <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Servants</HI> will permit that it may be
<PB N="70" REF="001460_0071_0FB34C60AC7EE650"/>
done with Decency, shall Extend unto them also. And they shall be concerned in the <HI>Conferences,</HI> where∣in the Repetition of the Publick Sermons, may en∣gage me with my <HI>Family.</HI> If any of them, when they come to me, have not Learnt the <HI>Catechism,</HI> I will see to it, that they shall do it; and give them a <HI>Reward</HI> when they have done it.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> I will be very <HI>Inquisitive</HI> and <HI>Sollicitous</HI> about the <HI>Company</HI> chosen by my <HI>Servants;</HI> and with all possible Cogency rescue them from the Snares of <HI>Evil Company:</HI> forbid their being the <HI>Companions of Fools.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> Such of my <HI>Servants</HI> as may be Employ'd for that purpose, I will Employ to Teach <HI>Lessons of Piety</HI> unto my <HI>Children;</HI> and Recompense them for doing so But I would with a particular <HI>Artifice</HI> contrive them to be such <HI>Lessons,</HI> as may be for their own E∣dification too.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> I will sometimes call my <HI>Servants</HI> alone; Talk with them about the <HI>State of their Souls;</HI> Tell them how to close with their only <HI>Saviour,</HI> Charge them to Do well, and <HI>Lay hold on Eternal Life;</HI> And show them very Particularly, how they may render all the <HI>Service</HI> they do for <HI>me,</HI> a Service to the Glorious <HI>Lord;</HI> how they may do all from a Principle of O∣bedience to the Lord, and become Intitled unto the <HI>Reward of the Heavenly Inheritance.</HI></P></Q>
<P>I make this Appendix to these RESOLUTI∣ONS. I have read such a Passage as this.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Age</HI> is well nigh sufficient with some <HI>Masters</HI> to ob∣literate every Letter and Action, in the History of a Meritorious Life: and <HI>Old Services</HI> are generally buried under the Ruines of an <HI>Old Carcase.</HI></Q> And this Passage, <Q>Its a barbarous Inhumanity in men to∣wards their Servants, to make their small Failings to
<PB N="71" REF="001460_0072_0FB34C6429ADE818"/>
be a Crime, without allowing their past Services to have been a Vertue.</Q> <HI>Good God, keep thy Servant from such Ingratitude!</HI> Worse than <HI>Villianous</HI> Ingratitude!</P>
<P>But then, O <HI>Servants,</HI> If you would ar∣rive to the <HI>Reward of the Inheritance,</HI> You should Set your selves to <HI>Devise; How shall I approve my self such a Servant, that the Lord may Bless the House of my Master, the more for my being in it?</HI> Certain∣ly, There are many wayes, wherein <HI>Servants</HI> may be <HI>Blessings.</HI> Let your <HI>Studies</HI> with your con∣tinual <HI>Prayers</HI> for the welfare of the <HI>Families</HI> to which you belong, and the <HI>Example</HI> of your So∣ber Carriage, render you such. If you will re∣member but <HI>Four Words,</HI> and Endeavour all that is comprized in them, OBEDIENCE, HONES∣TY, INDUSTRY, and PIETY, you will be the <HI>Blessings</HI> and the <HI>Josephs</HI> of the Families to which you belong. Let those Four Heads, be distinct∣ly &amp; frequently thought upon. And go cheer∣fully through all you have to do, upon this con∣sideration; <HI>That it is an Obedience to Heaven, and from thence will have a Recompence.</HI> It was the Ob∣servation even of a Pagan, <HI>That a Master may re∣ceive a Benefit from a Servant.</HI> And, <HI>Quod fit af∣fectu Amici, definit esse Ministerium.</HI> It is a <HI>Friend∣ship</HI> rather than a <HI>Service, Young man,</HI> if it be with the Affection of a <HI>Friend,</HI> that you do what you do for your <HI>Master.</HI> Yea, Even the <HI>Maid-Servants</HI> in the House, may do an unknown <HI>Ser∣vice</HI> to it, by Instructing the <HI>Infants,</HI> and In∣stilling
<PB N="72" REF="001460_0073_0FB34C652C9AA7C8"/>
the <HI>Lessons of Goodness</HI> into them. So, by <HI>Bilhah,</HI> and <HI>Zilpah,</HI> may Children be <HI>Born again;</HI> The <HI>Mistresses</HI> may by the <HI>Travail</HI> of their <HI>Maid-Servants,</HI> have <HI>Children,</HI> brought into the King∣dom of God.</P>
<P>I will go on. <HI>Humanity</HI> teaches us, to take Notice of all that are our <HI>Kindred. Nature</HI> be∣speaks, that which we call a <HI>Natural Affection</HI> to all that are <HI>Akin</HI> to us. To be without it, is a very Bad Character; 'tis a Brand on the worst of <HI>Men;</HI> on such as forfeit the Name of <HI>Men.</HI> But now, <HI>Christianity</HI> is to Improve it. Our <HI>Natural Affection</HI> is to be improved into a <HI>Religious Inten∣tion.</HI> Sir, Take a Catalogue of all your more <HI>Distant Relatives.</HI> Consider them One after another; and make every one of them, the Subjects of your <HI>Good Devices.</HI> Think; <HI>Wherein may I pursue the Good of such a Relative?</HI> And, <HI>By what means may I render such a Relative the better for me?</HI> It is possible, you may do something, that may give them cause to Bless God, that ever you have been <HI>Related</HI> unto them. Have they no <HI>Calamity,</HI> under which you may give them some Relief? Is there no <HI>Temptation</HI> a∣gainst which you may give them some Caution? Is there no Article of their <HI>Prosperity,</HI> to which you may be Subservient? At least; with your affectionate <HI>Prayers,</HI> you may go over your <HI>Ca∣talogue;</HI> You may Successively Pray for every One of them all by Name; And, if you can, Why should you not also put agreeable <HI>Books

of Piety</HI> into their Hands, to be Lasting <HI>Remem∣bancers</HI> of their <HI>Duties</HI> to God, and of your <HI>Desires</HI> for them?</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. MEthinks, This Excellent Zeal should be carried into our <HI>Neighbourhood. Neighbourhood,</HI> You stand <HI>Related</HI> unto One another; And you should be full of <HI>Devices,</HI> That all the <HI>Neighbours</HI> may have cause to be glad of your being in the <HI>Neighbourhood.</HI> We read, <HI>The Righ∣teous is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> But we shall scarce own him so, Except he be <HI>more Ex∣cellent</HI> AS <HI>a Neighbour.</HI> He must <HI>Excell</HI> in the Duties of <HI>Good Neighbourhood.</HI> Let that man be <HI>Better</HI> than his <HI>Neighbour,</HI> who Labours to be a <HI>Better Neighbour;</HI> to Do most <HI>Good</HI> unto <HI>his Neigh∣bour.</HI></P>
<P>And here, first; The <HI>Poor</HI> People that ly <HI>Wounded,</HI> must have <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oyl</HI> poured into their <HI>Wounds.</HI> It was a charming Stroke in the Character with a Modern Prince had given to him, <HI>To be in Distress, is to deserve his Favour.</HI> O Good Neighbour, put on that Princely, that more than Royal Quality. See who in the Neigh∣bourhood may <HI>Deserve thy Favour.</HI> We are told, <HI>This is Pure Religion and Undefiled;</HI> (A Jewel, that neither is a counterfeit, nor has any Flaws in it:) <HI>To Visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction.</HI> The <HI>Orphans</HI> and the <HI>Widows,</HI> and so all the Children of <HI>Affliction</HI> in the Neighbour∣hood,
<PB N="74" REF="001460_0075_0FB34C6CCAB35588"/>
must be <HI>Visited,</HI> and Relieved with all a∣greeable Kindnesses.</P>
<P><HI>Neighbours,</HI> Be concerned, That the <HI>Orphans</HI> and <HI>Widows</HI> in your Neighbourhood, may be well provided for. <HI>They</HI> meet with grievous Dif∣ficulties; with unknown Temptations. While their next <HI>Relatives</HI> were yet Living, they were, perhaps, but meanly provided for. What must they now be in their more Solitary. condition? Their condition should be considered. And the Result of the consideration should be that; <HI>I delivered the Orphan, that had no Helper, and I caused the Heart of the Widow to Sing for Joy.</HI></P>
<P>By consequence, All the Afflicted in the Neigh∣bourhood, are to be thought upon. Sirs, Would it be too much for you, at least <HI>Once in a Week?</HI> To Think, <HI>What Neighbour is reduced into a Pinch∣ing and Painful Poverty? Or in any Degree Im∣poverished with heavy Losses?</HI> Think, <HI>What Neigh∣bour is Languishing with Sickness; Especially if Sick with sore Maladies, and of some Continuance?</HI> Think, <HI>What Neighbour is Heart-broken with sad Bereave∣ments; Bereaved of Desireable Relatives?</HI> And Think; <HI>What Neighbour has a Soul buffeted, and hurried with violent Assaults of the Wicked one?</HI> But then Think, <HI>What shall be done for such Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>First, You will <HI>Pitty</HI> them. The Evangelical Precept is, <HI>Have Compassion One of another, Be Pit∣tiful.</HI> It was of old, and ever will be, the just Expectation, <HI>To him that is Afflicted, Pitty should be shown.</HI> And let our <HI>Pitty</HI> to them, flame out
<PB N="75" REF="001460_0076_0FB34C7353103BD8"/>
in our <HI>Prayer</HI> for them. It were a very Lovely Practice for you, in the <HI>Daily Prayer</HI> of your <HI>Closet</HI> every Evening, to think, <HI>What miserable Object have I seen to day, that I may do well now to mention for the Mercies of the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all, 'Tis possible, 'tis proba∣ble, you may do well to <HI>Visit</HI> them; and when you <HI>Visit</HI> them, <HI>Comfort</HI> them. Carry them some <HI>Good Word,</HI> which may raise a <HI>Gladness,</HI> in an <HI>Heart Stouping with Heaviness.</HI></P>
<P>And lastly. Give them all the <HI>Assistences</HI> that may answer their <HI>Occasions:</HI> Assist them with <HI>Advice</HI> to them; Assist them with <HI>Address</HI> to others for them. And if it be needful, Bestow your <HI>Alms</HI> upon them; <HI>Deal thy Bread to the Hungry; Bring to thy House the Poor that are cast out; when thou seest the Naked, Cover him.</HI> At least, <HI>Nazianzens</HI> Charity, I pray; <HI>Si nihil habes, da Lacrymulam;</HI> If you have nothing else to bestow upon the Miserable, bestow a <HI>Year</HI> or two upon their Miseries. This <HI>Little,</HI> is better than <HI>No∣thing!</HI></P>
<P>Would it be amiss for you, to have alwayes lying by you, a List of the <HI>Poor</HI> in your Neigh∣bourhood, or of those whose <HI>Calamities</HI> may call for the <HI>Assistences</HI> of the Neighbourhood? Such a <HI>List</HI> would often furnish you, with Matter for an <HI>Useful Conversation,</HI> when you are Talking with your Friends, whom you may <HI>Provoke to Love and Good Works.</HI></P>
<P>I will go on to say; Be Glad of <HI>Opportunities</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="001460_0077_0FB34C74EEB90770"/>
to <HI>Do Good</HI> in your <HI>Neighbourhood:</HI> Yea, look out for them, lay hold on them, with a rapturous Assiduity. <HI>Be Sorry</HI> for all the <HI>Bad Circumstances</HI> of any Neighbour, that bespeak your <HI>doing of Good</HI> unto him. Yet, <HI>Be Glad,</HI> if any one tell you of them. Thank him who tells you, as having therein done you a very great Civility. Let him know, that he could not by any thing have more gratified you. Any <HI>Civility</HI> that you can show, by <HI>Lending,</HI> by <HI>Watching,</HI> by — all the Methods of <HI>Courtesie;</HI> Show it; and be glad you can Show it. Show it, and give a <HI>Pleasant Coun∣tenance, [Cum munere Vultum,]</HI> in the Showing of it. Let your <HI>Wisdom</HI> cause your <HI>Face</HI> always to <HI>Shine;</HI> Look, not with a <HI>Cloudy</HI> but a Serene and <HI>Shining Face,</HI> upon your Neighbours; and Shed the Rayes of your <HI>Courtesy</HI> upon them, with such Affability, that they may see they are Wel∣come to all you can do for them. Yea, Stay not until you are told of <HI>Opportunities</HI> to <HI>Do Good.</HI> Enquire after them; Let the Enquiry be Sollici∣tous, be Unwearied. The Incomparable Plea∣sure, is worth an Enquiry.</P>
<P>There was a generous Pagan, who counted a <HI>Day Lost,</HI> if he had obliged no body in the Day. <HI>Amici, Diem Perdidi!</HI> O <HI>Christian,</HI> Let us try, whether we can't attain to Do Something, for Some Neighbour or other, every day that comes over our Head. Some do So; and with a bet∣ter Spirit, than ever <HI>Titus Vespasian</HI> was acted withal. Thrice in the Scriptures, we find the
<PB N="77" REF="001460_0078_0FB34C766817AC00"/>
Good Angels <HI>Rejoycing:</HI> 'Tis alwayes, <HI>At the Good of Others.</HI> To <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in the <HI>Good</HI> of Others, and most of all in doing of <HI>Good</HI> unto them, 'tis <HI>Ange∣lical Goodness.</HI></P>
<P>In moving for the <HI>Devices</HI> of <HI>Good Neighbour∣hood,</HI> a principal motion which I have to make, is; That you Consult the <HI>Spiritual</HI> Interests of your Neighbourhood, as well as the <HI>Temporal.</HI> Be concerned, Left the <HI>Deceitfulness of Sin</HI> undo any of the Neighbours. If there be any <HI>Idle Persons</HI> among them, I beseech you, cure them of their <HI>Idleness;</HI> Don't nourish 'em &amp; Harden 'em in That; but find <HI>Employment</HI> for them. Find 'em <HI>Work;</HI> Set 'em to <HI>Work;</HI> Keep 'em to <HI>Work. Then,</HI> as much of your other Bounty to them, as you please.</P>
<P>If any <HI>Children</HI> in the Neighbourhood, are un∣der no Education, don't allow 'em to continue so, Let care be taken, that they may be better Edu∣cated; and be taught to Read; and be taught their <HI>Catechism;</HI> and the Truths and Wayes of their only Saviour.</P>
<P>Once more. If any in the Neighbourhood, are taking to <HI>Bad Courses,</HI> Lovingly &amp; Faithfully Admonish them. If any in the Neighbourhood are Enemies to their own Welfare, or their Fa∣milies; Prudently dispense your Admonitions unto them. If there are any <HI>Prayerless Families,</HI> never leave off Entreating and Exhorting of them, till you have perswaded them, to Set up the <HI>Worship</HI> of God. If there be any <HI>Service</HI> of God, or of His People, to which any
<PB N="78" REF="001460_0079_0FB34C77E31E3430"/>
one may need to be Excited, give him a Tender Excitation. Whatever <HI>Snare</HI> you see any one in, be so kind, as to tell him of his Danger to be <HI>En∣snared,</HI> and Save him from it. By putting of <HI>Good Books</HI> into the Hands of your Neighbours, and gaining of them a Promise to <HI>Read the Books,</HI> who can tell, what Good you may do unto them! It is possible, you may in this way, with Ingenuity, and with Efficacy, administer those <HI>Reproofs,</HI> which you may owe unto such Neigh∣bours, as are to be <HI>Reproved</HI> for their Miscarriages. The <HI>Books</HI> will balk nothing, that is to be said, on the Subjects, that you would have the Neigh∣bours advised upon.</P>
<P>Finally. If there be any <HI>Base Houses,</HI> which threaten to debauch, and Poison, and confound the Neighbourhood, Let your Charity to your Neighbours, make you do all you can, for the suppression of them.</P>
<P>That my PROPOSAL <HI>To Do Good in the Neigh∣bourhood, and as a Neighbour,</HI> may be more fully formed and followed; I will conclude it, with minding you, That a World of <HI>Self-Denial</HI> is to be Exercised in the Execution of it. You must be armed against <HI>Selfishness,</HI> all <HI>Selfish</HI> and <HI>Squinting</HI> Intentions, in your generous Resolutions. You shall see how my Demands will grow upon you.</P>
<P>First. You must not think of making the <HI>Good</HI> you do, a pouring of Water into a Pump, to draw out something for your selves. This might be the meaning of our Saviours Direction; <HI>Lend,
<PB N="79" REF="001460_0080_0FB34C79634E19E8"/>
Having for nothing again.</HI> To <HI>Lend</HI> a Thing, pro∣perly is to <HI>Hope</HI> that we shall <HI>Receive it again.</HI> But this probably refers to the, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Or, <HI>Collation,</HI> usual among the Ancients, whereof we find many Monuments and Mentions in Anti∣quity. If any Man by Burnings, or Shipwrecks or other Disasters, had lost his Estate, his Friends did use to <HI>Lend</HI> him considerable Sums of Money, to be Repaid, not at a certain Day, but when he should find himself Able to Repay it, without Inconvenience. Now, they were so cunning, that they would rarely <HI>Lend</HI> upon such Disasters, unto any but such, as they had <HI>Hope,</HI> would Recover out of their present Impoverishment, and not only Repay them their Money, but also <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Requite</HI> their Kindness, if ever there should be need of it. The thing required by our Saviour, is, <HI>Do Good unto such as you are never like to be the Better for.</HI></P>
<P>But then, there is yet an Higher Thing to be demanded, That is; <HI>Do Good</HI> unto those Neigh∣bours who have <HI>Done Hurt</HI> unto you. So sayes our Saviour, <HI>Love your Enemies, Bless them that Curse you, Do Good to them that Hate you, and Pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.</HI> Yea, If an <HI>Injury</HI> have been done you, improve it as a provocation to do <HI>Benefit</HI> unto him who did the <HI>Injury.</HI> This is Noble. T'wil bring mar∣vellous Consolations! Another Method might make you <HI>Even</HI> with your Froward Neighbours; This, will Set you <HI>Above</HI> them all. T'were Nobly
<PB N="80" REF="001460_0081_0FB34C7AE780D6B8"/>
done, If in the close of the Day, when you are Alone before the Lord, you make a <HI>Particular Prayer,</HI> for the Pardon and Prosperity, of any Person, from whom you may have suffered any Abuse in the Day. And it would be Nobly done, If at last calling over the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of such as have been Abusive to you, you may be able to say, [the only Intention that can justify your doing any thing like to keeping a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of them!] <HI>There is not one of these, but I have done him, or watch'd to do him, a Kindness!</HI> Among the <HI>Jews</HI> themselves, there were the <HI>Hasideans,</HI> One of whose Institutions it was, To make this Daily Prayer unto God, <HI>Remitte et condona omnibus qui Vexant nos. Christians,</HI> go beyond them. Yea, <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> tells us, In the Primitive Times they did so; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Praying for their Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>But I won't Stop here. There is yet an High∣er Thing to be demanded. That is; <HI>Do Good</HI> unto those Neighbours, who will <HI>Speak Ill</HI> of you, after you have done it. So sayes our Saviour; <HI>Ye shall be the Children of the Highest; He is kind unto the Unthankful, and unto the Evil.</HI> You will every day find, I can tell you, <HI>Monsters of Ingratitude.</HI> Yea, if you <HI>distinguish</HI> any Person, with Doing for him, something more than you have done for others, it will be well if that very Person do not at some time or other, hurt you wonderfully. Oh! the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of <HI>Divine Providence,</HI> in ordering this Thing! Sirs, It is, that you may <HI>Do Good</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="001460_0082_0FB34C7F600E6008"/>
on a <HI>Divine Principle; Good,</HI> meerly for the Sake of <HI>Good! Lord, Increase our Faith!</HI></P>
<P>And God forbid, that a <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> should not come up to a <HI>Jewish!</HI> There is a Memorable Passage, in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Records. <Q><HI>There was a Gentleman, of whose Bounty many People eve∣ry day received Reliefs and Succours. One day he asked;</HI> Well, What do our People say to day? <HI>They told him,</HI> Why, The People partook of your Kindnesses, and Services, and then they Bless'd you very fervently. <HI>Did they so, Said he;</HI> Then I shall have no Great Reward for this Day. <HI>Another Day he asked,</HI> Well, And what say our People now? <HI>They told him,</HI> Alas, Good Sir, the People Enjoy'd your Kindnesses to day, and when all was done, they did nothing but Rail at you. <HI>Indeed! Said he;</HI> Now for this Day I am sure that God will give me a Good and Great Reward.</Q></P>
<P>Tho' vile Constructions, and harsh Invectives, be never so much the <HI>Present Reward</HI> of doing the best Offices for the Neighbourhood, yet, my Dear <HI>Boniface;</HI> Be victorious over all Discourage∣ments: <HI>Thy Work shall be well Rewarded, saith the Lord!</HI></P>
<P>If your Opportunities to <HI>Do Gcod</HI> reach no further, yet I will offer you a Consolation, which One has Elegantly thus Expressed. <HI>He that Praises God only on a Ten-stringed Instrument, with his Authority Extending but unto his Family, and his Example but unto his Neighbourhood, may have as Thankful an heart here, and as high a Place in the
<PB N="82" REF="001460_0083_0FB34C80E1284030"/>
Caelestial Choir hereafter, as the greatest Monarch, that Praiseth God upon a Ten thousand string'd Instrument. Upon the Loud sounding Organs, having as many Millions of Pipes as there be People under him.</HI></P>
<P N="13">§ 13. HOw can we leave the offices of <HI>Good Neighbourhood,</HI> without Interposing a PROPOSAL, To Animate and Regulate <HI><HI>Private Meetings</HI> of Religious People, for the Exercises of Religion?</HI> It is very certain, That where such <HI>Private Meetings</HI> under a Good Con∣duct, have been kept Alive, the Christians which have Composed them, have like so many <HI>Coals of the Altar</HI> kept one another Alive, and kept up a lively Christianity in the Neighbourhood. Such <HI>Societies</HI> have been tried and strong En∣gines, to uphold the <HI>Power of Godliness.</HI> The Throwing up of such <HI>Societies,</HI> has been accom∣panied with a visible <HI>Decay of Godliness;</HI> the Less <HI>Love</HI> to them, the Less <HI>Use</HI> of them, there has been in a Place, the Less has <HI>Godliness</HI> flourished there; the Less there has been of, <HI>The King∣dom of God.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Rules</HI> Observed by Some, <HI>Associated Families,</HI> may be offered on this occasion with some Advantage. They will tell us what <HI>Good</HI> may be done by such <HI>Societies</HI> in a Neigh∣bourhood.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> It is to be proposed. That about a dozen <HI>Fami∣milies,</HI> more or less, of a Vicinity, Agree to Meet (the Men and their Wives) at each others Houses, once in a Fortnight, or a Month, at such a Time as may be
<PB N="83" REF="001460_0084_0FB34C8480A46DC0"/>
Agreed upon, and Spend a convenient Quantity of Time together, in the <HI>Exercises of Religion.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> The <HI>Exercises of Religion</HI> proper for a <HI>Meeting,</HI> are; For the Brethren to Begin and Conclude with <HI>Prayers</HI> in their Turn; For <HI>Psalms</HI> to be Sung; And for <HI>Sermons</HI> to be Repeated.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> It were desireable, for the <HI>Ministers</HI> now and then, to afford their Presence at the Meeting, and <HI>Pray</HI> with them, and <HI>Instruct</HI> them, and <HI>Exhort</HI> them, as they may see occasion.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> The <HI>Candidates</HI> of the Ministry may do well, to Perform some of their <HI>First Services</HI> here, and here Shape and Mould themselves for <HI>Further Services.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> One Special <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Meeting,</HI> should be, with <HI>Ʋnited Prayers,</HI> to Ask the Blessings of Heaven on the Family where they are Assembled, as well as on the rest: That with the wondrous Force of <HI>Ʋnited Prayers, Two or Three may agree on Earth, to ask such things,</HI> as are to be done for the Families, by <HI>our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> Such a <HI>Meeting</HI> should Look upon themselves, as bound up in One <HI>Bundle of Love;</HI> and count them∣selves obliged, in very Close and Strong Bonds, to be Serviceable unto one another. If any one in the So∣ciety should fall into <HI>Affliction,</HI> all the rest should pre∣sently Study to Relieve and Support the Afflicted Per∣son, in all the wayes imaginable. If any one should fall into <HI>Temptation,</HI> the rest should Watch over him, and with the <HI>Spirit of Meekness,</HI> with the <HI>Meekness of Wisdom,</HI> Endeavour to Recover him. It should be like a <HI>I am of the Medes and Persians</HI> to the whole So∣ciety, That they will upon all just occasions, Lovingly <HI>Give,</HI> and as Lovingly <HI>Take,</HI> mutual Admonitions <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any thing that they may see <HI>Amiss</HI> in one another</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> And it is not only to reckon up the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> such a <HI>Society</HI> may do to many, many others <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="84" REF="001460_0085_0FB34C85655D1428"/>
well as to the <HI>Members</HI> whereof it is it self composed, The <HI>Prayers</HI> of such well-disposed <HI>Societies,</HI> may fetch down marvellous Favours from Heaven on their <HI>Pastors,</HI> whose <HI>Lives</HI> may be prolonged, and <HI>Gifts</HI> aug∣mented, and <HI>Graces</HI> brightened, and <HI>Labours</HI> prospered, in answer to the Supplications of such Associated Fa∣milies; And the <HI>Interests of Religion</HI> may be mightily preserved and promoted in the <HI>whole Flock,</HI> by their Fervent Supplications; and the <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> mighti∣ly poured out upon the Rising Generation. Yea, <HI>All the Land</HI> may fare the better for them.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> Especially, when a <HI>Society</HI> shall set apart, <HI>whole Days</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord, as it may be proper for them to do now and then upon some occasions. The <HI>Success</HI> of such <HI>Dayes</HI> has been some∣times very marvellous: and the <HI>Savour</HI> of them, left on the Minds of the Saints, who have carried them on, has been such, as notably to prepare them, to <HI>Show forth the Death of the Lord</HI> at His Holy Table; Yea, to <HI>Meet with their own Death,</HI> when God pleases to order it.</P>
<P N="9"><HI>IX.</HI> It is very sure, The <HI>Devotions</HI> first, and afterwards the <HI>Conferences,</HI> carried on in such a <HI>Society,</HI> will not only have a notable Tendency to produce the <HI>Com∣fort of Love</HI> in the Hearts of Good Men toward One a∣nother; But also their <HI>Abilities</HI> will be thereby Sharp∣ened and Quickened; they will be rendred more <HI>Able,</HI> to Serve many valuable Interests.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>X.</HI> Unexpected <HI>Opportunities to Do Good,</HI> will arise unto such a <HI>Society:</HI> But especially, if a Practice of this importance were once taken up; That the MEN who Compose the <HI>Society,</HI> would now and then Spend half an Hour together by themselves, in Considering on that Question, <HI>What Good is there to be done?</HI></P>
<P>More Particularly;</P>
<P>Who are to be caused upon, to do their Duty, in coming to Special Ordinances?</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="001460_0086_0FB34C886BC27BF0"/>Who is in any Special Adversity; and what shall be done to Comfort them?</P>
<P>What Contention or Variance may there be among any Neighbours, and what may be done for the Healing of it?</P>
<P>What Open Miscarriages do any Live <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and who shall be desired to carry Faithful Admonitions unto them?</P>
<P><HI>Finally;</HI> What is there to be done for the Advantage, and Advancement of our Holy Religion?</P>
<P>In the Primitive Times of Christianity there was much use made of a Saying, which they ascribed unto <HI>Matthias</HI> the Apostle; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>If the Neighbour of an Elect,</HI> or Godly, <HI>Man Sin, the Godly Man him∣self has also Sinned.</HI> The Obligations of Neigh∣bours Watchfully to <HI>Admonish</HI> one another, were what that Saying intended. Oh! how much may <HI>Christians Associated</HI> in Religious Combina∣tions, do by Watchful and Faithful Admonitions, to prevent being <HI>Partakers in other Mens Sins!</HI></P>
<P>The Man, that shall produce, and promote such <HI>Societies,</HI> will do an unknown deal of Good in the <HI>Neighbourhood.</HI></P>
<P>And so will he, that shall help forward another Sort of <HI>Societies;</HI> namely, those of <HI>Young Men Associated.</HI></P>
<P>These duely managed, have been incompara∣ble <HI>Nurseries</HI> to the <HI>Churches,</HI> where the Faithful Pastors have countenanced them. <HI>Young Men</HI> are hereby <HI>Preserved</HI> from very many <HI>Temptations,</HI> Rescued from the <HI>Pathes of the Destroyer,</HI> Confir∣med in the <HI>Right Wayes of the Lord,</HI> and Prepared
<PB N="86" REF="001460_0087_0FB34C8A01C20320"/>
mightily for such <HI>Religious Exercises</HI> as will be Expected from them, when they come them∣selves to be <HI>Housholders.</HI></P>
<P>I will make a Tender of some ORDERS, which have been observed in some such <HI>Societies.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Let there be <HI>Two Hours</HI> at a Time Set apart; and, Let there be <HI>Two Prayers</HI> made by the Members of the <HI>Society,</HI> in their <HI>Turns;</HI> Between which, Let a <HI>Sermon</HI> be Repeated; And there may be the Singing of a <HI>Psalm</HI> annexed.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Let all the Members of the Society, Resolve to be <HI>Charitably Watchful</HI> over one another: Never to di∣vulge one anothers Infirmities; Alwayes to inform and advise one another of every thing that may ap∣pear to call for an Admonition, and to take it Kindly when they are Admonished.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Let all who are to be admitted as Members of the <HI>Society,</HI> be accompanied by Two or Three of the rest, unto the <HI>Minister</HI> of the Place, that they may re∣cieve his Holy Counsils, and Charges, and that every thing may be done with his Approbation; and so let their <HI>Names</HI> be added unto the <HI>Roll.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV</HI> If any Person thus <HI>Enrolled</HI> among them, fall into a <HI>Scandalous Iniquity,</HI> Let the Rebukes of the <HI>Society</HI> be dispensed unto him; and let them Forbid him to come any more among them, until he bring Suitable Expressions and Evidences of <HI>Repentance</HI> with him.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Let the <HI>List</HI> be once a Quarter called over; and then, if it be Observed, that any of the <HI>Society</HI> have much absented themselves, Let there be Some sent un∣to them, to Enquire the Reason of the Absence; and if no Reason be given, but such as intimates an <HI>Apostasy</HI> from Good Beginnings, Let them upon Obstinacy, af∣ter Loving and Faithful Admonitions, be Obliterated.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="87" REF="001460_0088_0FB34C8B64948C38"/><HI>VI.</HI> Once in Three Months, Let there be, if Need be, a <HI>Collection,</HI> out of which the Necessary Charges of the <HI>Society</HI> shall be Defray'd, and the rest be Employ'd upon such Pious Uses, as may be agreed upon</P>

His <HI>Kingdom.</HI> They whom the Word of God calls <HI>Angels,</HI> ought certainly to be of an <HI>Angelical Disposition;</HI> Disposed evermore to <HI>Do Good,</HI> like the <HI>Good Angels; Ministers</HI> alwayes on the Wing to <HI>do His Pleasure.</HI> 'Tis no improper PROPOSAL, That they would Seriously Set themselves to think, <HI>What are the Points wherein I should be Wise and Do Good, like an Angel of God?</HI> Or, <HI>If an Angel were in Flesh, as I am, and in such a Post as I am, what Methods may I justly imagine, he would use to Glorify God?</HI> What wonderful Of∣fices, of <HI>Kindness,</HI> and with how much <HI>Delight,</HI> would the <HI>Good Angels</HI> do, for such their <HI>Fellow-Servants!</HI> We must call upon our people, <HI>To be Ready to Every Good Work.</HI> We must Go be∣fore them in it; By our own <HI>Readiness at Every Good Work,</HI> show them how. <HI>Timothy, Be thou an Example of the Believers!</HI> It is a true Maxim, and you cannot think too often upon it; <HI>The Life of a Minister, is the Life of his Ministry.</HI> And there is another Maxim like unto it, <HI>The Sins of Teach∣ers are the Teachers of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Allow me, Sirs. Your <HI>Opportunities to Do Good,</HI> are Singular. Your want of Worldly <HI>Riches,</HI> and of any way ordinarily to get 'em, is com∣pensated by the <HI>Opportunities to Do Good,</HI> which you are <HI>Enriched</HI> withal.

<P>'Tis to be hoped, That the Main Principle that acted you, when you first Entred upon the <HI>Evangelical Ministry,</HI> was, <HI>An Hope to do Good in the World.</HI> If that principle were then too feeble in its operation, 'tis Time that it should now o∣perate, and that you should now Vigorously act upon it, and that the <HI>Zeal</HI> thereof should now <HI>Eat up</HI> your Time, your Thought, your All.</P>
<P>That you may be <HI>Good Men,</HI> and be mightily Inspired and Assisted from Heaven to <HI>Do Good,</HI> it is needful that you should be <HI>Men of Prayer.</HI> I lay this down to be allow'd, as my very First <HI>Postulatum!</HI> In the Pursuance of this Intention, there appears more than a little Need of it, That you should ever now and then Keep whole <HI>Dayes of Prayer,</HI> in an Holy Retirement before the Lord; Often Set apart, whole <HI>Dayes,</HI> for <HI>Prayer with Fasting,</HI> in Secret, and perfume your Studies with <HI>Devotions Extraordinary:</HI> and usually with a Mixture of <HI>Alms,</HI> to go up in the <HI>Memorial</HI> be∣fore the Lord.

<P>The more Significantly you represent the <HI>Va∣rious Cases</HI> of your People in your <HI>Publick Prayers;</HI> the more devoutly sensible you will make them of their own cases. And it will wonderfully comfort them!</P>

<P>Your <HI>Sermons,</HI> if they be <HI>Well-Studied,</HI> as from the consideration of their being <HI>Offerings</HI> unto God, <HI>the Great KING,</HI> as well as unto His Peo∣ple, they ought to be, will <HI>Do Good</HI> beyond all Expression. The manner of your <HI>Studying</HI> them, is that which may much contribute unto it. It is needful, that you Study the <HI>Condition</HI> of your Flocks; and bring them such <HI>Truths,</HI> as will no∣tably <HI>Suit</HI> their present circumstances. In order to this, You will observe their <HI>Condition,</HI> their Faults, their Snares, their Griefs, that you may <HI>Speak a word in Season;</HI> and if any thing Remar∣kable Fall out, you will Suit the <HI>Words</HI> to the <HI>Works</HI> of God.

<HI>Early Piety.</HI> Yea, You may do well to let it be understood, that you would willingly be advised, by any <HI>Persons,</HI> or <HI>Meetings,</HI> in your Flocks, what <HI>Subjects</HI> they may want or wish to hear Treated on; By giving them <HI>Sermons</HI> on such <HI>Subjects,</HI> you at least very much Edify those who have asked for them; and it is probable, very many more.</P>
<P>And, what if while you are Studying your <HI>Ser∣mons,</HI> You should at the close of every Paragraph, make a <HI>Pause,</HI> and Endeavour with <HI>Acknowledge∣ments</HI> and <HI>Ejaculations</HI> to Heaven, and with <HI>Self-Examinations,</HI> to feel some Impressions of the <HI>Truths</HI> in that Paragraph on your own Souls, be∣fore you go any further? By such a Practice, the <HI>Hours</HI> which you take, to Make and Write a <HI>Sermon,</HI> will prove so many <HI>Hours of Devotion</HI> with you. The <HI>Day</HI> in which you have made a <HI>Sermon</HI> will even leave upon your Mind, such a Savour as a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> uses to do. When you come to Preach the Sermon, you will do it with great Liberty and Assurance; and the <HI>Truths</HI> thus prepared will be likely to come with a more Sensible Warmth and Life upon the Auditory; <HI>From the Heart, and To the Heart!</HI> A famous Preacher would say, <HI>I Never durst Preach a Ser∣mon to others, till I have get first some Good by it my self.</HI> And I will add, <HI>That is the way for it to do much Good unto others.</HI> Let such a <HI>Rabbi,</HI> be called, our <HI>Hadarsan.</HI> [or, The <HI>Preacher!</HI>] Let the Saying of the Ancient be Remembred; <HI>Qui Ludi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>But then, Sirs, Your <HI>Visits;</HI> Oh! how much may you do for CHRIST among your People in them! It is Pitty but that you should impose it as a Law upon your selves; <HI>Never to make an Unprofitable Visit.</HI> Even when you render a Pure <HI>Visit</HI> of <HI>Civility,</HI> or for <HI>Diversion,</HI> 'tis easy for you, to keep this Law; <HI>That you will drop some Speech or other, Good for the use of Edifying, before you leave the Company.</HI> There have been <HI>Pastors</HI> able to say, They Scarce ever once went into an House among their People in their Lives, without some Essay or Purpose to <HI>Do Good</HI> in the House, be∣fore they came out of it.</P>
<P>The same Rule would be very well observed with such as <HI>Come</HI> unto us, as well as with those whom we <HI>Go</HI> unto. Why should any of our People ever come anear us, without our con∣triving, <HI>To Speak something to them that may be use∣ful to them!</HI> Our <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> having been ma∣ny Dayes in <HI>Bucers</HI> House, Published this Report of it. <HI>Ausim affirmare, me ab illius Mensa, semper discessisse Doctiorem</HI> I make no Doubt, That the Observation of this Rule, may be very consistent with an <HI>Assable,</HI> yea, and, as far as is <HI>Convenient,</HI> a <HI>Facetious</HI> Conversation. Tho' <HI>Quae sunt in ore populi Nugae, sunt in ore sacerdotis Blasphemiae.</HI></P>
<P>But, Sirs, In your <HI>Visits,</HI> you will take a parti∣cular Notice of the <HI>Widow,</HI> the <HI>Orphan,</HI> the <HI>Afflicted;</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="001460_0096_0FB34C976597B7E0"/>
and carry all agreeable Reliefs unto them. The <HI>Bills</HI> put up in your Congregations, will a little help you, to find out, who need your <HI>Visits.</HI></P>
<P>If any <HI>Special Calamity</HI> hath befallen any One, 'tis a Time to <HI>Visit</HI> them, with very particular <HI>Directions</HI> and <HI>Perswasions</HI> unto them, to hear the <HI>Voice of God</HI> in the Calamity; to comply with the <HI>Intent</HI> and <HI>Errand,</HI> which it comes upon.</P>
<P>If any One has received any <HI>Special Deliverance,</HI> 'tis a Time to <HI>Visit</HI> them, and therein to perswade them, that they will think of some <HI>Singular Thing,</HI> to be done by way of Thankfulness for their De∣liverance; and not leave them, till the Thing be Agreed and Resolv'd upon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Handmaids of the Lord,</HI> that are near their <HI>Lying in,</HI> may on this account be very proper objects for your <HI>Visits.</HI> At such a Time they are in much distress; the approaching <HI>Hour of Trou∣ble</HI> threatens to be their <HI>Dying Hour.</HI> The Coun∣sils that will Exactly instruct them how to pre∣pare far a <HI>Dying Hour,</HI> will now if ever, be at∣tentively hearkened unto.

<P>CATECHISING, is a Noble I Exercise; it will insensibly bring you into a wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> that Surpasses all Expression.

Speak to them in the Pulpit, as what you Speak to them in the more <HI>Approaching</HI> and <HI>Familiar</HI> way, of Applying the Answers of the <HI>Catechism.</HI> Never any <HI>Minister,</HI> that was a <HI>Great Catechizer</HI> did Repent of it; Thousands, Thousands: have bless'd God, with Wonders &amp; Praises, for the good Success of it. The most <HI>Honourable Man of God,</HI> should reckon it, no Abasement or Abatement of his Honour, to Stoup unto this <HI>Way of Teaching.</HI> Yea, some Eminent Pastors, in their Emerited <HI>Old Age,</HI> when other Labours have been too hard for them, have, like the famous old <HI>Gerson,</HI> wholly given themselves up to <HI>Catechising;</HI> Tho' there have been others of whom that brave Chancellour of <HI>Paris,</HI> in his Treatise, <HI>De Pueris ad Christum tra∣hendis,</HI> makes a sad complaint; <HI>Adeo jam indig∣num videtur apud Multos, si quis ex Theologis, aut famatus in Literis, vel Ecclesiastica Dignitate Praedi∣tus, ad hoc opus se inclinaverit.</HI></P>

<P>But Some have chosen the way of <HI>Pastoral Visits.</HI> And from the Memorials of One who long since did so, and then left his, <HI>Paterna,</HI> to his <HI>Son</HI> upon it, I will transcribe the Ensuing Passages.</P>
<P>For, <HI>Pastoral Visits.</HI></P>

<P>You may still send before hand unto the <HI>Families,</HI> that you intend at such a Time to <HI>Visit</HI> them. And when you come unto them; you may assay with as Handsome and as Pungent Addresses as you are able, to treat every Person particularly about their Ever∣lasting Interests.</P>
<P>First. You may discourse with the <HI>Elder</HI> People upon such Points as you think most proper for them.</P>
<P>And especially, charge them to Maintain <HI>Family-Prayer;</HI> and Obtain their Promises for it, if they have yet neglected. Yea, Now <HI>Pray with them,</HI> that you may show them <HI>how to Pray,</HI> as well as to obtain their Purposes for it.</P>
<P>You may likewise press upon them, the Care of In∣structing their <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> in the Holy Re∣ligion of our <HI>Saviour;</HI> and to bring them up for Him.</P>
<P>If any that you should have Spoken with, were Absent, you may frequently Leave a Solemn Text or Two of the <HI>Sacred Scripture,</HI> which you think most a∣greeable for them; Desiring Some-body present, That they would Remember you Kindly to them, and from you Recommend unto them <HI>that Oracle</HI> of God.</P>
<P>You may then call for the <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> And putting unto them such <HI>Questions</HI> of the <HI>Catechism,</HI> as you think fit, you may, from the <HI>Answers,</HI> make as lively Applications unto them, as you can, for the Engaging of them unto the Fear of God.</P>
<P>You may frequently get <HI>Promises</HI> from <HI>them,</HI> rela∣ting to <HI>Secret Prayer,</HI> and <HI>Reading</HI> of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> to their <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Masters.</HI></P>
<P>And you may frequently Set before them the <HI>Pro∣posals</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="001460_0099_0FB34A0362C5DB00"/>
of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> after you have Laboured for their Conviction &amp; Awakening; till with Floods of Tears, they Expressly Declare their Consenting to, and Accepting of, the <HI>Proposals</HI> of the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> which you distinctly set before them.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Lesser Folks,</HI> you my order, to bring their <HI>Bibles</HI> unto you, and Read unto you from thence Two or Three Verses, whereto you may turn them. This will <HI>Try,</HI> whether they can <HI>Read well,</HI> or no. You may then Charm them to Think on such Things, as you thence observe for their Admonition, and never Forget those <HI>Faithful Sayings</HI> of God.</P>
<P><HI>You may some times leave some</HI> Awful Question <HI>with them; which, you may tell them, they shall not Answer to</HI> You, <HI>but Answer to</HI> Themselves. <HI>As,</HI> What have I been doing, ever since I came into the World, about the Great Errand upon which God sent me into the World? <HI>And,</HI> If God should now call me out of the World, what would become of me throughout Eternal Ages? <HI>And,</HI> Have I ever yet by Faith carried a Perishing Soul unto my only Saviour, for both Righteousness and Salvation?</P>
<P>You will Enjoy a most wonderful Presence of God with you, in this undertaking; and seldom leave a <HI>Family,</HI> without many <HI>Tears</HI> of Devotion dropt by all sorts of Persons in it.</P>
<P>You can seldome Dispatch more than <HI>Four</HI> or <HI>Five</HI> Families in an Afternoon; and the work may be as <HI>Laborious</HI> as any in all your Ministry.</P>
<P><HI>My Son,</HI> I advise you, to set a special Value upon that part of your Ministry, which is to be discharged in <HI>Pastoral Visits.</HI> You will not only <HI>Do,</HI> but also <HI>Get,</HI> more than a little Good, by your Conversation with all sorts of Persons, in thus <HI>Visiting</HI> of them <HI>from House to House</HI> And you will never more <HI>Walk in the Spirit,</HI> than when you thus <HI>Walk</HI> about your Flock, to Do what Good you can among them.</P></Q>

<P>It is a Proposal made, by Holy Mr. <HI>Thomas White; That Able and Zealous Ministers, might some∣times Preach at the Schools. Because the Preaching of the Word is the Converting Ordinance; and the Chil∣dren will be Obliged there to hear with more Attention,
<PB N="100" REF="001460_0101_0FB34A04DDE35630"/>
than they often do in the Publick. And the Ministers might here condescend unto such Expressions, as might work most upon them, and such as are not so fit for a Publick Congregation.</HI> I have read this Account of One who was awakened by this Advice, to do such things as these;</P>
<P><Q>At certain Times he Successively Visited the <HI>Schools.</HI> When he came to a <HI>School,</HI> he first made a <HI>Prayer</HI> o∣ver the <HI>Children,</HI> as much adapted unto their Condi∣tion, as he could make it. Then he went thro' the <HI>Catechism;</HI> or as much of it, as he thought necessary; making the several <HI>Children</HI> to Repeat the several <HI>Answers.</HI> But he still broke the <HI>Questions,</HI> for each Ar∣ticle in the <HI>Answers,</HI> to be understood by them, with a <HI>Yes,</HI> or, <HI>No,</HI> Expected from them. And he put such <HI>Questions</HI> also, as would make them to see and own their own <HI>Duties,</HI> and often to Express a Resolution to Do their <HI>Duties.</HI> Then he Preached a Short <HI>Ser∣mon</HI> to them; Exceeding Plain; on some Suitable Scripture; and with all the Artifice and Pungency he could use, to raise Attention &amp; Affection in them. After this he singled out a Number of <HI>Scholars,</HI> it may be Seven or Eight, or Ten; and bid each of them turn to a certain Scripture; which he made them Read unto the whole <HI>School;</HI> because it still re∣lated unto something as he gave them to see by his brief Remarks upon it, which it particularly concer∣ned Children to take Notice of. Then he concluded with a brief <HI>Prayer,</HI> for a Blessing on the <HI>School,</HI> and on the <HI>Tutors</HI> in it.</Q></P>
<P>We are upon <HI>Visiting;</HI> You will be sure to <HI>Visit</HI> the <HI>Poor</HI> as well as the <HI>Rich;</HI> and often mention the Condition of the <HI>Poor,</HI> in your Conversation with the <HI>Rich.</HI> Keep, Sir, a <HI>List</HI> of 'em!</P>

<P>But then, in Visiting the <HI>Poor,</HI> you will take occasion to dispense your <HI>Alms</HI> among them. These <HI>Alms</HI> you will, with as much contrivance as may be, make the <HI>Vehicles,</HI> to Convey the <HI>Ad∣monitions of Piety</HI> unto them; yea, the Methods and Machines of obtaining from them, some Engagements to perform certain <HI>Exercises of Piety.</HI> All Ministers are not alike <HI>furnished</HI> for <HI>Alms;</HI> they should all be <HI>disposed</HI> for them.

What sayes <HI>Nazian∣zen</HI> of his Reverend Fathers <HI>Alms-Deeds?</HI> They will find, That the more they <HI>do</HI> (provided it be <HI>done with Discretion,</HI>) the more they <HI>may;</HI> The <HI>Loaves</HI> will multiply in the <HI>Distribution.</HI> Sirs, This Bounty of yours to the <HI>Poor,</HI> will procure a mighty Esteem and Success to your Ministry. <HI>Suadet Lingua, Jubet Vita.</HI> T'will be an ungain-sayable Demonstration, that you <HI>Believe what you Speak,</HI> about all the Duties of <HI>Christianity,</HI> but particularly of <HI>Liberality,</HI> and a <HI>Faithful discharge of our Stewardship,</HI> and a Mind weaned from the <HI>Love of this World;</HI> It will demonstrate your Be∣lief of a <HI>Future State.</HI> It will Vindicate you

from the Imputation of, <HI>A Worldly Man;</HI> It will Embolden you, and Fortify you, with a great Assurance, when you call upon others, <HI>To Do Good,</HI> and abound in the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> which <HI>God is well-pleased</HI> withal. <HI>Et sic Exempla Parantur!</HI></P>
<P>You will do well to keep a Watchful Eye on the <HI>Disorders</HI> that may grow up and get Head, in your Neighbourhood. Among other wayes to Suppress those things, you may Form <HI>Societies for the Suppression of Disorders;</HI> Obtain a fit num∣ber of Prudent, Pious, well affected Men, to <HI>As∣sociate</HI> upon that Intention; Employ <HI>their</HI> Dis∣cretion, and <HI>their</HI> Activity, for your Assistence in your Holy Purposes.</P>
<P>One of the Rules given for the <HI>Minister,</HI> is, <HI>Give thy self to Reading.</HI> Sirs, Let <HI>Gregories Pastoral,</HI> &amp; <HI>Bowles's Pastor Evangelicus,</HI> be some of the Books on which you bestow a <HI>Reading.</HI> But then, if you Read <HI>Church History</HI> very much, (and parti∣cularly, the <HI>Prudentia Veteris Ecclesiae,</HI> Written by <HI>Vedelius,</HI>) but especially the <HI>Lives</HI> of both Anci∣ent and Modern <HI>Divines,</HI> you will ever now and then find, <HI>Methods to Do Good,</HI> Exemplified. You will then consider, how far you may <HI>Go and do likewise.</HI></P>
<P>How Serviceable may <HI>Ministers</HI> be, unto one another, and unto all the Churches, in their seve∣ral <HI>Associations!</HI> Many things of General Advan∣tage to all their Flocks may be advanced, and consulted there. Yea, 'Tis Pitty, that there should be the least occasional <HI>Meeting of Ministers</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="001460_0104_0FB34A0AE39E87C0"/>
at any time, without <HI>Some Useful thing</HI> proposed in it.</P>
<P><HI>Nero</HI> took it very ill, that <HI>Vespasian</HI> Slept, at his <HI>Musick!</HI> It is very much, very much to be Wish∣ed, That the Sin of <HI>Sleeping at Sermons,</HI> were more Watch'd against, and more Warn'd against. Your <HI>Sleepy Hearers,</HI> if, alas, the <HI>Catechresis</HI> may be allow'd that calls them <HI>Hearers,</HI> do miserably lose the <HI>Good</HI> of your Ministry; and the <HI>Good</HI> which you might, perhaps, have particularly design'd for them, whom at the Time of your Speaking what you prepar'd for them, you see Siezed with an horrible <HI>Spirit of Slumber</HI> before your Eyes. Will no <HI>Vinegar</HI> help against the <HI>Narcoticks,</HI> that Satan has given to your Poor <HI>Eutychus's!</HI> Or, Can't you bring that <HI>Civility</HI> into Fashion among your Hearers, <HI>To wake one another!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finally;</HI> After all the Generous Essayes and Labours to <HI>Do Good,</HI> that may fill your Lives, your People will probably treat you with much <HI>Ingra∣titude.</HI> Your <HI>Salaries</HI> will be meaner than even those at <HI>Geneva.</HI> They will <HI>Neglect</HI> you; they will <HI>Oppress</HI> you; they will <HI>Defraud</HI> you, of what they have Engaged, and you have Expected.

To <HI>Bear E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> is to <HI>Do Good.</HI> The more <HI>Patient</HI> you are under <HI>Ill Usage,</HI> the more you Exhibit a Glorious CHRIST unto your Peo∣ple, in your conformity to your admirable Sa∣viour.

The more <HI>Conformed</HI> you are unto Him, the more <HI>Prepared</HI> you are, 'tis possible, for some Amendment of your condition in this World; most certainly for the Recompences of the Hea∣venly World, when you appear before the Lord, who sayes, <HI>I know thy Works, and Charity, and Ser∣vice, and Faith, and thy Patience.</HI></P>
<P>I will say This; If to Represent, a Glorious CHRIST, unto the View, and Love, and Admi∣ration of all People, be the Grant Intention of your <HI>Lives;</HI> To be a <HI>Star</HI> that Leads men to Christ, and Stands there!

<P>There was a Worthy Minister whom the Great <HI>Cranmer</HI> design'd for Preferment; and he gave
<PB N="105" REF="001460_0106_0FB34A0E20B42970"/>
this Account of his Design about him; <HI>Nihil appetit, nihil ardet, nihil somniaet, nisi</HI> JESUM CHRISTUM. Verily, Such <HI>Men of Christ,</HI> are <HI>Men of God.</HI> They are the <HI>Favourites of Heaven;</HI> and shall be <HI>Favoured</HI> with Opportunities to <HI>Do Good,</HI> above any men in the World: They are the <HI>Men whom the King of Heaven will delight to Honour!</HI> And they are the <HI>Gaons</HI> of Christianity.</P>
<P>If I reserve one thing to be mentioned after <HI>Finally,</HI> 'tis because I am in a Doubt, whether it should be mentioned at all. In some <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> they do not permit a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel to practise as a <HI>Physician;</HI> Because either of those Callings is ordinarily enough to find a full Employment for him that faithfully fol∣lows it. But, the <HI>Priests</HI> of old, who reserved in the Archives of their Temples, the Stories of the Cures thankfully acknowledged there; com∣municated from thence Directions for cures in such cases among their Neighbours. Nor has it been a rare thing it Later Ages for <HI>Clergy men</HI> to be <HI>Physicians.</HI> Not only such Monks as <HI>Aegidius Athenienfis,</HI> and <HI>Constantinus Afer,</HI> and others▪ who had Liesure for it: but such Bishops as <HI>Bacbelt,</HI> yea, such Arch-bishops as <HI>Albicus,</HI> have appeared under that Character. So, <HI>Herbert</HI> advises that his <HI>Country-Minister,</HI> (or at least, his Wife,) should be much of a <HI>Physician</HI> to his Flock. And we have known many a <HI>Country Minister</HI> prove a vast Blessing to his Flock, by being so. If a <HI>Minister</HI> do any thing this way. Let

Tis an <HI>Angelical Conjunction,</HI> when <HI>the Ministers who do the Pleasure</HI> of CHRIST, shall also be <HI>Phy∣sicians</HI> and <HI>Raphaels</HI> unto their People! In a more <HI>Populous Place,</HI> you will perhaps chuse ra∣ther, Sir, to get some Religious and Accomplish∣ed <HI>Physician</HI> into your Neighbourhood; &amp; make <HI>Medical Studies</HI> your own Diversion as much as may be; but with some Eye to this, That you will Communicate unto your <HI>Luke,</HI> what nota∣ble Things you do in Reading meet withal; and some-times <HI>Unite Counsils</HI> with him, for the good of his Patients.

And <HI>Luthers,</HI> That our <HI>Schools</HI> are more <HI>Pagan</HI> than <HI>Christian;</HI> And the Reports and Wishes of a late Writer, who sayes; <Q>I knew an aged and famous <HI>School-Master,</HI> that after he had kept School about Fifty years, said with a sad Coun∣tenance, That it was a great Trouble unto him, that he spent so much Time in Reading Pagan Authors to his Scholars, and wished it were customary to Read such a Book as <HI>Duports</HI> Ver∣ses upon <HI>Job,</HI> rather than <HI>Homer,</HI> and such Books. I pray God, put it in the Hearts of a Wise Par∣laiment, to <HI>Purge our Schools;</HI> that instead of Learning Vain Fictions, and Filthy Stories, they may be acquainted with the Word of God, and with Books containing Grave Sayings, and things that may make them truely Wise and Useful in the World:</Q> I suppose, there will be little Notice taken of such <HI>Proposals:</HI> I had as good never mention them; Tis with <HI>Despair,</HI> that I make mention of them.</P>

PROPOSAL, has been so Little hearkened un∣to, 'tis Lamentable, 'tis Admirable! But — <HI>They all Slumbred and Slept.</HI></P>
<P>There is another PROPOSAL, which has been tendered to all our Churches, and attended in Some of them.</P>
<P><Q>That the several Churches, having in an <HI>Instru∣ment</HI> Proper for that Purpose, made a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of such things, as can indisputably be found amiss a∣mong them, do with all Seriousness and Solemnity pass their VOTES, That they count such things to be very <HI>Offensive Evils,</HI> and that Renouncing all De∣pendence on their own Strength, to avoid such Evils, they humbly Ask the Help of the <HI>Divine Grace,</HI> to Assist them in Watching against the said Evils, both in Themselves and in One another. And that the <HI>Communicants</HI> do often Reflect upon those their <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> and <HI>Protestations,</HI> as Perpetual <HI>Monitors</HI> unto them, to prevent the Miscarriages wherewith too many Professors are too Easily over∣taken.</Q></P>
<P>It has been considered, That such humble <HI>Recognitions of Duty,</HI> will not only be Accepted by our God, as our <HI>Declarations</HI> for Him, where∣upon He will Declare for us; but also, they are the <HI>Way of the New Covenant,</HI> for our obtaining of Help to do our Duty. —</P>

What better thing is there to be recommended unto a <HI>Physician,</HI> who desires to <HI>Do Good,</HI> than this; <HI>Good Sir, Be a Man o Prayer.</HI> In your Daily and Secret <HI>Prayer</HI> carry every one of your <HI>Pati∣ents</HI> by Name, (as you would your own Chil∣dren,) unto the Glorious <HI>Lord our Healer</HI> for His Healing <HI>Mercies:</HI> Place them as far as your <HI>Prayer</HI> will do it, under the <HI>Beams</HI> of the <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI> And as any <HI>New Case</HI> of your Pa∣tients may occur, especially if there be any Dif∣ficulty in it, why should you not make your Par∣ticular and Sollicitous Applications to Heaven for Direction! <HI>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself, nor is it in man that walketh, to direct his Steps;</HI> No, nor in man that healeth, to perform his Cures. <HI>Hippocrates</HI> advised Phy∣sicians, that when they Visited their Patients, they should consider, whether there might not be, <HI>Divinum quiddam in morbo.</HI> Truly, in some sense, there is ever so, and it should be considered.

<P>We read, <HI>Heaviness in the Heart of Man makes it Stoup, but a Good Word makes it Glad.</HI> We read, <HI>A Cheerful Heart doth Good like a Medicine, but a broken Spirit drieth the Bones.</HI> And <HI>Baglivi</HI> is not the only Physician, who has made the Observation. <Q>That a great part of our Diseases, either do Rise from, or are Fed by, a <HI>Weight of Cares</HI> lying on the <HI>Minds</HI> of Men. Diseases that seem <HI>Incureable,</HI> are Easily cured by Agreeable Conversation <HI>Disorders</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> first bring Dis∣eases on the <HI>Stomach;</HI> and so the whole Mass of Blood gradually becomes infected.

<HI>Religious Principles.</HI> Give him a <HI>Prospect,</HI> if you can, of some <HI>Deliverance</HI> from his Distresses, or some <HI>Abate∣ment</HI> of them. Raise in him as <HI>Bright Thoughts</HI> as may be, and Scatter the <HI>Clouds,</HI> remove the <HI>Loads,</HI> which his Mind is Perplexed withal: Especially, by Repre∣senting &amp; Magnifying the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD in CHRIST unto him. It is Possible, Sir, That you may in this way also, find our <HI>Obliging Occasions</HI> to Exercise abun∣dance of <HI>Goodness,</HI> in Doing your self, or in bringing others to Do, <HI>Kindnesses</HI> for the Miserable.</P>
<P>And what should hinder you, from Considering the <HI>Souls</HI> of your <HI>Patients,</HI> their <HI>Interiour State;</HI> their <HI>Spiri∣tual Health;</HI> what they <HI>have done,</HI> &amp; what they <HI>have to do,</HI> that they may be in <HI>Good Terms with Heaven?</HI> You may from their <HI>Natural Distempers,</HI> affect your own Minds, &amp; theirs too, with a Sense of our <HI>Analogous Moral</HI> ones. You may make your Conversation with them, a <HI>Vehicle</HI> for such <HI>Admonitions of Piety</HI> as may be most <HI>Needful</HI> for them: That they may neither be found <HI>Ʋnprepared</HI> for <HI>Death,</HI> nor <HI>Ʋnthankful</HI> &amp; <HI>Ʋnfruitful</HI> upon their escaping of it. This you may do, without any Indecent Intrusion in∣to the Office of the <HI>Minister;</HI> But you may indeed at the same Time do many a Good Office for the <HI>Mini∣ster,</HI> as well as for the <HI>Patient,</HI> and inform the Minister when and where and how he may be very Serviceable among some of the Miserable, with whose condition he may else happen to be unacquainted. The <HI>Art of Healing</HI> was, you know, first brought into order by men that had the <HI>Care of Souls.</HI> And I know not why they who profess and practise that Noble <HI>Art,</HI> should now wholly cast off that <HI>Care.</HI> Perhaps you Remember a <HI>King,</HI> who was also a <HI>Physician</HI> [For other <HI>Crowned Heads,</HI> besides <HI>Mithridates</HI> and <HI>Hadrianus</HI> and <HI>Constan∣tinus Pogonatus,</HI> have been so!] and who gave this Reason why the <HI>Greeks</HI> had such Diseases among them so much uncured; <HI>Because they neglected their Souls, the
<PB N="134" REF="001460_0135_0FB34BE3CC70A588"/>
chief thing of all.</HI> For my part, I know not why the <HI>Physician</HI> should wholly <HI>neglect the Souls</HI> of his Patients!</P>
<P>I will hold you no Longer. You are not ignorant, that <HI>Medicine</HI> in the World, once was, and in many Ungospellized parts of the World still is, <HI>A Thing hor∣ribly Magical. Celsus</HI> tells it, as a part of the <HI>Egypti∣an Philosophy</HI> current in his Time, That the Body of man is divided into <HI>Thirty Six</HI> Parts, each of which was the peculiar Allotment and Possession of a <HI>Daemon;</HI> and this <HI>Daemon</HI> was by the <HI>Magi</HI> call'd upon, to cure Diseases of the part that belong'd unto him. Even in <HI>Galens</HI> time we find <HI>Prestigiaturas Aegyptias</HI> Practised; he himself writes of them. Other Countries were from <HI>Aegypt</HI> infected with them. Hence <HI>Medicines</HI> were called, <HI>Pharmaca.</HI> The <HI>Oriental</HI> Nations had their <HI>Teraphim</HI> for the cure of Diseases. Whence <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies, both to <HI>Worship,</HI> and to <HI>Cure.</HI> And, <HI>Curae Morborum,</HI> is reckoned by <HI>Eusebius</HI> one main Article of the <HI>Pagan Theology.</HI> God used all proper Means, for Saving His People, from having to do with that sort of <HI>Men,</HI> or of <HI>Means.</HI> He Commended unto them, the Study of Nature, and of Natural Remedies. They did after the Example of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Study <HI>Bota∣nicks:</HI> They had their <HI>Apothecaries</HI> who were to furnish them with <HI>Materials</HI> for Medicines. The Princes of <HI>Judea</HI> had, as <HI>Pliny</HI> tells us, Their <HI>Physick Gardens.</HI> Probably <HI>Naboths</HI> Vineyard might have such an one in it; which might be the Reason why <HI>Ahab</HI> did so Covet it. And <HI>Joram,</HI> the Son of <HI>Ahab,</HI> repaired hi∣ther, to be cured of his Wounds. An Excellent Physician, in a late Composition with which he has obliged the Publick, thinks, The Sin of <HI>Asa,</HI> when he <HI>Sought not unto the Lord, but unto the Physicians,</HI> was, both occasioned and Aggravated by this; There were at this time none but <HI>Magical Physicians.</HI> But some others have thought, that some of <HI>Asa's</HI> Ancestors had been
<PB N="135" REF="001460_0136_0FB34BE4E2834038"/>
<HI>Medically</HI> disposed, and were Students in the <HI>Art of Healing.</HI> From hence might come the Name of <HI>Asa:</HI> for <HI>Asa</HI> is the <HI>Chaldee</HI> word for a <HI>Physician.</HI> It may be, for that cause this King might have the Greater Esteem for those who were skill'd in <HI>Medicines,</HI> and put a <HI>Con∣fidence</HI> in them, that had with it and in it, a Neglect of the glorious GOD; the only Author and Giver of Health. What I aim at, in this Paragraph, is but Summarily to bespeak the <HI>Reverse</HI> of all this; That my Honourable <HI>Asa,</HI> [<HI>Honourable!</HI> the Son of <HI>Sirach</HI> has taught me to call him so!] would himself continu∣ally go to <HI>God our Saviour</HI> on all occasions, and as far as he can, bring all his <HI>Patients</HI> thither also.</P>
<P>Finally; An Industrious and an Ingenious Gentle∣man of your Profession, has a Passage in a Preface to his, <HI>Pharmacopaeia Bateana,</HI> which, I will here insert; because very many of you can Speak the like; and by inserting it, I propose, to increase the Number.</P>
<P><Q>I know no poor Creature that Ever came to me in my whole Time, that once went from me, with∣out my Desired Help <HI>gratis.</HI> And I have accounted the Restoration of such a Poor and Wretched Crea∣ture, a greater Blessing to me, than if I had gotten the Wealth of both the <HI>Indies.</HI> I can't so well Ex∣press my self concerning this matter, as I can conceive it; but I am sure, I should have been more pleased, and had a greater Satisfaction, in seeing such an Helpless creature Restored to its Desired Health, than if I had found a very valuable Treasure. All the Good I have done in these cases, as I never can Re∣pent it, so I Resolve to continue it; For I certainly know, I have had the Signal Blessing of God, at∣tending my Endeavours, for it.</Q></P>
<P N="19"><PB N="136" REF="001460_0137_0FB34BE664AE2EB8"/>§. 19. I <HI>Will get me unto the Rich Men, — and will Speak unto them:</HI> For they will <HI>know the wayes</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> and will think, what they shall be able to say, when they come into the <HI>Judgment of their God.</HI> An English Person of Quality, quoting that Passage, <HI>The Desire of a Man is his Kindness,</HI> invited me so to read it, <HI>The</HI> only <HI>Desireable thing in a man is his Goodness.</HI> How Happy would the World be if every Person of Quality would come into this Perswasion! It is an Article in my Commission; <HI>Charge them that are Rich in this World, That they Do Good, that they be Rich in Good Works, Ready to Distribute, willing to Communicate.</HI> In pursuance thereof, I will put <HI>Rich Men</HI> in mind of the Opportunities to <HI>Do Good,</HI> with which the God, who <HI>gives Power to Get Wealth,</HI> has favoured and obliged and en∣riched them. It was an Account, and a very Good one it was, that has been sometimes given of a Good man; <HI>The Wealth of this World, he knew no Good in it, but the doing of Good with it.</HI> Yea, those men who have had very little <HI>Good∣ness</HI> in them, yet in describing, <HI>The manners of the Age,</HI> in which they have had perhaps themselves too deep a Share, have seen cause to Subscribe and Publish this prime Dictate of Reason; <HI>We are never the better for any thing, barely for the Pro∣priety Sake; but it is the Application of it, that gives every thing its value.

in need on't.</HI> Sirs, You cannot but Acknowledge, That it is the Sovereign GOD, who has bestow'd upon you, the <HI>Riches</HI> which distinguish you. A <HI>Devil</HI> himself, when he Saw a <HI>Rich Man,</HI> could not but make this Acknowledgment unto the God of Heaven, <HI>Thou hast Blessed the work of his hands, and his Substance is increased in the Land.</HI> It is also a Thing, whereof 'tis to be hoped, you are not unapprehensive, That the <HI>Riches</HI> in your possession are some of the <HI>Talents,</HI> whereof you must give an Account unto the Glorious LORD, who has betrusted you therewithal: And that you will <HI>give up your Account with Grief, and not with Joy,</HI> if it must be found, that <HI>All</HI> your Estates have been laid out, only to gratify the Appetites of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Little</HI> or <HI>Nothing</HI> of them consecrated unto the Service of <HI>God,</HI> and of His Kingdom in the World. We read of the Servants assign'd unto the <HI>Priests</HI> of old, <HI>Unto you they are given as a Gift for the Lord.</HI> It is what is to be said of all our <HI>Estates.</HI> What God gives us, is not given us for our selves, but <HI>for the Lord.</HI> And, <HI>Cum crescunt Dona crescunt etiam Rationes Donorum.</HI> Indeed there is hardly any Professor of Christianity, so <HI>Vitious,</HI> but he will own, that All of his Estate is to be used in <HI>Honest Uses;</HI> and part of it, in <HI>Pious Uses.</HI> If any plead their <HI>Po∣verty,</HI> to Excuse them, and Exempt them, from doing any thing this way, O <HI>Poor Widow</HI> with thy <HI>two Mites,</HI> Eternized in the History of the Gospel, Thou shalt <HI>Rise up in the Judgment with
<PB N="138" REF="001460_0139_0FB34BE966FE3550"/>
that Generation, and shalt Condemn them.</HI> And let them also know, that they take a course, to con∣demn and confine themselves unto Eternal <HI>Po∣verty.</HI> But the main Question is, about the <HI>Quo∣ta Parts;</HI> How much of a Mans Income is to be Devoted unto <HI>Pious Uses?</HI> And now, Let it not seem an <HI>Hard Saying,</HI> if I say unto you, That a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> is the least that you can bring under a more <HI>Solemn Dedication</HI> unto the Lord; for whom indeed, after some sort, we are to lay out our <HI>All.</HI> A Farthing less, would make an En∣lightened and Considerate Christian, Suspici∣ous, of his coming under the Danger of a <HI>Sacri∣ledge.</HI> By the <HI>Pious Uses</HI> for which your <HI>Tenths</HI> are thus challenged, I do not intend only the <HI>Maintenance of the Evangelical Ministry,</HI> but also the Relief of the <HI>Miserable</HI> whom our Merciful Saviour has made the Receivers of His Rents, and all that is to be more directly done, for the Preserving and Promoting of <HI>Piety</HI> in the World. Since there is a <HI>Part</HI> of every mans Revenues due to the Glorious Lord, and such <HI>Pious Uses,</HI> it is not Fit that the Determination of <HI>What Part,</HI> it must be, should be left unto such Hearts as ours. My Friend Thou hast, it may be, too high an Opinion of thy own <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> if nothing but thy own <HI>Carnal Heart,</HI> shall deter∣mine still <HI>When,</HI> and <HI>What,</HI> thy Revenues are to do, for Him, whom thou art so ready to <HI>Forget,</HI> when He has <HI>Filled</HI> thee. But if the LORD Himself, to whom thou art but a <HI>Steward,</HI> has
<PB N="139" REF="001460_0140_0FB34BEAE7C2FC50"/>
fixed any <HI>Part</HI> of our usual <HI>Revenues,</HI> for Himself, as 'tis most Reasonable that He should have the Fixing of it, certainly a <HI>Tenth</HI> will be found the least that He has called for. A <HI>Tenth</HI> is the <HI>Least Part</HI> in the First Division of Numbers, which is that of <HI>Unites. Grotius</HI> notes it, as the Foun∣dation for the Law of Tithes; <HI>Numerus Denarius Gentibus ferme cunctis Numerandi Finis est.</HI> It is but fair, and the very <HI>Light of Nature</HI> will declare for it; That the Great GOD, who with a <HI>Se∣venth Day,</HI> is own'd as the <HI>Creator,</HI> should with a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> be own'd as the <HI>Possession</HI> of All Things. We don't Allow Him so much as <HI>The Least,</HI> if we withold a <HI>Tenth</HI> from Him. Less than <HI>That,</HI> is less than what all Nations make <HI>The Least.</HI> Cer∣tainly, To withold this, is to <HI>Withold more than is Meet.</HI> Sirs, you know the <HI>Tendency.</HI> Long before the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Dispensation of the Law, we find, that this was <HI>Jacobs</HI> Vow, <HI>The Lord shall be my God, and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the Tenth unto thee.</HI> It seems we do not sufficiently Declare, <HI>That the Lord is our God,</HI> if we do not <HI>Give a Tenth</HI> unto Him. And how can we approve our selves <HI>Israelites Indeed,</HI> if we sleight such a Pattern of our <HI>Father Jacob?</HI> I will ascend a Little Higher. In one Text we read of our <HI>Father Abraham, He gave Melchizedek the Tenth of all.</HI> In another Text we read of our Saviour JESUS, <HI>Thou art a Priest for ever after the Order of Melchizedek.</HI> Hence I form this Argu∣ment; The Rights of <HI>Melchizedek</HI> belong to our

JESUS, the <HI>Royal High-Priest</HI> now concerned in the Heavens for us. The <HI>Tenths</HI> were the Rights of <HI>Melchizedek.</HI> Therefore the <HI>Tenths</HI> belong to our JESUS. I do in my Conscience believe, <HI>That this Argument cannot be answered.</HI> The man seems to blur one Evidence of his being one of the true Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> that goes to answer it. I do Renew my <HI>Appeal</HI> to the <HI>Light of Nature. To Nature thou shalt go!</HI> 'Tis very certain, That the Ancient Pagans did use to <HI>Decimate</HI> for <HI>Sa∣cred Uses. Pliny</HI> tells us, the <HI>Arabians</HI> did so. <HI>Xeno∣phon</HI> tells us, the <HI>Grecians</HI> did so. You find the custom, as old as the Pen of <HI>Herodotus</HI> can carry it. Tis confirmed by <HI>Pausanias,</HI> and by <HI>Diodorus Siculus.</HI> A whole Army of Authors, besides <HI>Doughty,</HI> have related this, and asserted it.

Tell it not!</HI> — But this I will tell; That they who have conscientiously Employ'd their <HI>Tenths</HI> in <HI>Pious Uses,</HI> have usually been Blessed in their Estates, with a very Remarkable Providence of God. The Blessing has been sometimes Delay'd, with some Trial of their <HI>Patience: Not for any Injustice in their Hands;</HI> Their <HI>Prayer</HI> has been <HI>Pure.</HI> And their <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Future State</HI> has been sometimes try'd, by their Meeting with some Losses, and some Disappointments. But then, their <HI>Little</HI> has been so Bless'd, as to be still a <HI>Competency;</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="001460_0142_0FB34BEFF9967650"/>
and God has Bless'd them with so much <HI>Conten∣tation</HI> in it, that it has yielded <HI>more</HI> unto them, than the <HI>much</HI> of many others. And <HI>very often,</HI> I say, <HI>very often,</HI> they have been Rewarded with a strange Success, and Increase of their Estates; even in this World, seen the Fulfilment of that Word; <HI>Cast thy Grain into the moist Ground; for thou shalt find it after many Dayes.</HI> And that word; <HI>Honour the Lord with thy Substance; so shall thy Barns be filled with Plenty.</HI> History has given us many and charming Examples, of those, who have had their Conscientious <HI>Decimations</HI> Followed &amp; Re∣warded with a Surprising Prosperity of their Affairs; And small <HI>Mechanicks,</HI> or <HI>Husbandmen,</HI> have Risen to Estates, which once they never durst have dreamed of. The Excellent <HI>Gouge,</HI> in his Treatise Entituled, <HI>The Surest and Safest way of Thriving,</HI> has collected some such Examples. The Jewish Proverb, <HI>Decima, ut Dives fias;</HI> or, <HI>Tythe and be Rich!</HI> would be oftner verified, if oftner Practised. <HI>Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not pour out a Blessing upon you!</HI> But let the Demand of <HI>Liberal Things</HI> grow upon you. <HI>A Tenth,</HI> I have called, <HI>The Least.</HI> For some, 'tis much <HI>Too Little.</HI> Men of great Estates, that would not <HI>Sow for their Flesh, &amp; rea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Corruption,</HI> May and will often go beyond a <HI>De∣cimation.</HI> Some of them rise to a <HI>Fifth;</HI> and the Religious Countess of <HI>Warwick,</HI> would not stop at any thing short of a <HI>Third.</HI> The Gentlemen my Readers, will Excuse me, if I carry them no

Higher, and say nothing to them, of a <HI>Joannes Bleemosynarius,</HI> who annually made a Distribu∣tion of all to Pious Uses; and having made even with his Revenues, then said, <HI>I bless God that I have now nothing left, but my Lord and Master</HI> CHRIST, <HI>whom I long to be withal, and whom I can with unentangled Wings now fly unto!</HI> Yet I will mention to them the Example of some Emi∣nent Merchants, who have set their Estates at a Moderate and Competent Elevation, and Re∣solved, They would never be any <HI>Richer</HI> than <HI>That.</HI> They have carried on a Great and Quick Trade; but what ever <HI>Gain</HI> carried their Estates beyond the <HI>Set Sum,</HI> they Devoted it all to <HI>Pious Uses.</HI> And were any of them, ever <HI>Losers?</HI> Never one of them! The Christian Emperour <HI>Tiberius</HI> 2. was <HI>famous</HI> for his Religious Bounties; His Empress thought him even <HI>Profuse,</HI> in them. He told her, <HI>He should never want Money so long as in Obedience to the Command of a Glorious Christ, he did Supply the Necessities of the Poor, and abound in such Religious Bounties.</HI> Once, immediately after he had made a Liberal Distribution, he unex∣pectedly found a mighty Treasure; and there were Tidings also brought him, of the Death of a Man vastly Rich, who had bequeathed all his Wealth unto him. Lesser men can tell very ma∣ny, and very taking Stories of this Importance, even from their own happy Experience.

<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> It is of old said, <HI>Res est Sacra Miser.</HI> To <HI>Relieve the Necessities of the Poor [Non Pavistis, occi∣distis;]</HI> this is a thing Acceptable to the Compassio∣nate God; who has given to <HI>You,</HI> what He might have given to <HI>Them;</HI> and has given it unto <HI>You</HI> that you might have the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Pleasure</HI> to Impart it unto <HI>them:</HI> And who has told you, <HI>He that has Pitty on the Poor, Lends unto the Lord.</HI> The more you consider the <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Image</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST in what you do this way, the more Assurance you have, that in the <HI>Day of God,</HI> you shall joy∣fully hear Him Saying, <HI>You have done it unto me!</HI> And the more Humble, Silent, Reserved <HI>Modesty</HI> you express, concealing even from the <HI>Loft Hand</HI> what is done with the <HI>Right,</HI> the more you are Assured of, <HI>A Great Reward in the Heavenly World.</HI> Such <HI>Liberal</HI> men, 'tis observed, are usually <HI>Long-Lived</HI> Men. <HI>Fructus Li∣berat Arborem.</HI> And at last, they pass from this unto <HI>Everlasting Life.</HI></P>
<P>The Name of a LADY, what is it in the Original Sense of the Word? It was first, <HI>Leafdian,</HI> then <HI>Lafdy:</HI> from <HI>Leaf,</HI> or <HI>Laf,</HI> which Signifies, <HI>A Loaf of Bread.</HI> And from <HI>D'ian</HI> to <HI>Serve.</HI> As much as to say, <HI>One who distributes Bread.</HI> The true LADY, is one who feeds the <HI>Poor,</HI> and makes agreeable <HI>Distributions</HI> to their <HI>Indigencies.</HI> In the Dayes of Primitive

Christianity, the <HI>Ladies</HI> of the best Quality, would Seek and Find out the <HI>Sick</HI> and Visit the <HI>Hospitals,</HI> and see what Help they wanted; and help them with an admirable Alacrity. The Mother, and the Sister of <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> what a <HI>Good Report</HI> have they obtained from his Pen, for their unwearied Bounties to the <HI>Poor?</HI> Em∣presses themselves have Stouped, &amp; they never Look'd so <HI>Great,</HI> as in their Stouping, to releive the Miserable;</P>
<LG>
<L>— And when they Stoup'd, it was to do</L>
<L>Some Good to others. Angels, they do so!</L>
</LG>
<P>When you keep your <HI>Dayes</HI> of <HI>Prayers,</HI> now is a Spe∣cial Season for your <HI>Alms:</HI> That your <HI>Prayers</HI> may go up with your <HI>Alms,</HI> as a <HI>Memorial before the Lord.</HI> Ve∣rily, There are <HI>Prayers</HI> in <HI>Alms.</HI> And, <HI>Is not this the Fast that I have Chosen, saith the Lord:</HI> The Note of the Beggar among the Jews was, <HI>Deser<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Something by me.</HI> Among us, it may be, <HI>Obtain Something by me.</HI></P>
<P>There is a City in the World, where every House hath a Box hanging in a Chain, on which is Written, <HI>Think on the Poor;</HI> and they commonly conclude no Bargain, but more or less is put into the Box. The <HI>Deacons</HI> have the Key, and once a Quarter go round the City, and take out the Money. When that City was like to have been lost; One who was not the best man in the World, yet could say, <HI>That he was of Opi∣nion, God would preserve that City from being Destroy'd, if it were only for the Great Charity they Express to the Poor.</HI> Tis the Richest City of the Richest Country, for its Big∣ness, that ever was in the World. A City that it is thought, spends yearly in Charitable Uses, more than all the Revenues which the whole Fine Country of the Grand Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI> brings in to the Arbitrary Master of it. You know, <HI>Manus Pauperum est Christi Gazophylacium.</HI></P>
<P>When you Dispense your <HI>Alms,</HI> unto the <HI>Poor,</HI> who
<PB N="146" REF="001460_0147_0FB34BF9E26392D8"/>
know, what it is to <HI>Pray,</HI> you may oblige them to <HI>Pray</HI> for you by Name every Day. Tis an Excellent Thing to have, <HI>The Blessing of them that have been Ready to Perish, thus coming upon you.</HI> Behold, A Surprising Sense in which you may be, <HI>Praying alwayes.</HI> You are so, even while you are <HI>Sleeping,</HI> if those whom you have so obliged are thus <HI>Praying</HI> for you! And Now, Look for the Accomplishment of that word; <HI>Blessed</HI> is he that considers the <HI>Poor; The Lord will Preserve him and Keep him Alive; and he shall be blessed on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Very often your <HI>Alms</HI> are dispersed among such as very much need <HI>Admonitions of Piety</HI> to accompany them. Can't you contrive, to intermix a <HI>Spiritual Charity,</HI> with your <HI>Temporal?</HI> Perhaps you may Dis∣course with them about the <HI>State of their Souls,</HI> and ob∣tain from them, which you now have a Singular Ad∣vantage to do, some <HI>Declared Resolutions</HI> to Do what they ought to do. Or else you may convey Little <HI>Books</HI> unto them, which certainly they will Promise to <HI>Read,</HI> when you thus bespeak their doing so.</P>
<P><HI>Charity</HI> to the <HI>Souls</HI> of Men, is undoubtedly the High∣est and the Noblest <HI>Charity,</HI> and of the greatest Conse∣quence. To furnish the Poor with <HI>Catechisms,</HI> and <HI>Bibles,</HI> is to do an unknown Deal of <HI>Good</HI> unto them. To Publish and Scatter <HI>Books of Piety,</HI> and to put into the Hands of Mankind such <HI>Treatises of Divinity</HI> as may have a Tendency to make them <HI>Wiser</HI> or <HI>Better;</HI> no man knows what <HI>Good</HI> he does in doing such things! It was exellently done of some Good men, who, a lit∣tle while ago were at the Charge of Printing Thirty Thousand of the, <HI>Alarm to the Ʋnconverted,</HI> written by <HI>Joseph Allein,</HI> to be all given away unto such as would promise to Read it. A man of no great Estate has be∣fore now with no great Trouble, given away the best part of a Thousand Books <HI>of Piety,</HI> Every year for ma∣ny years together. Who can tell, but with the Expence

of less than a Shilling, Sir, you may <HI>Convert a Sinner from the Error of his way, &amp; Save a Soul from Death!</HI> A worse Doom, than a, <HI>Damnatio ad metalla,</HI> is upon the <HI>Soul,</HI> who had rather hoard up his Money, than Employ it on such a <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P>He that <HI>Supports the Office</HI> of the <HI>Evangelical Ministry,</HI> Supports a <HI>Good Work;</HI> and performs One; yea, at the Second Hand performs what is done by the skilful, faithful, painful Minister, and that is <HI>many</HI> an one. The Encouraged Servant of the Lord, will do the more <HI>Good,</HI> for your Assistences, Tis done for a Glorious CHRIST, what you have done for <HI>him;</HI> and in Consideration of the <HI>Glorious Gospel</HI> Preached by him. And you shall <HI>Receive a Prophets Reward! Luther</HI> Said, <HI>Si quid Scholasticis confers, Deo ipsi Contulisti.</HI> Tis more Sensibly So, when the <HI>Scholars</HI> are become Godly &amp; Useful <HI>Preachers.</HI></P>
<P>I have read this Passage, <Q>It was for several years, the Practice of a Worthy Gentleman, in Renewing his Leases, instead of making it a Condition, that his Tenants should keep an <HI>Hawk</HI> or a <HI>Dog</HI> for him, to oblige them, that they should keep a <HI>Bible</HI> in their Houses, for themselves, and should bring up their Children to <HI>Read</HI> and be <HI>Catechised.</HI></Q> <HI>Land lords,</HI> 'Tis worth your Considering, whether you may not in your <HI>Leases,</HI> insert some <HI>Clauses,</HI> that may Serve the Kingdom of God. You are his <HI>Tenants,</HI> in those very <HI>Freeholds,</HI> where you are <HI>Land lords</HI> to other men! Oblige your <HI>Tenants</HI> to Worship God in their Families.</P>
<P>To take a <HI>Poor Child,</HI> especially an <HI>Orphan,</HI> Left in <HI>Poverty,</HI> and bestow an <HI>Education</HI> upon it, especially if it be a <HI>Liberal Education,</HI> is an admirable, &amp; a com∣plicated <HI>Charity;</HI> yea, it may draw on a long Train of <HI>Good,</HI> and interest you in all the <HI>Good</HI> that shall be done by those whom you have Educated</P>
<P>Hence also what is done for <HI>Schools,</HI> and for <HI>Colledges,</HI> and for <HI>Hospitals,</HI> is done for a <HI>General Good.</HI> The
<PB N="148" REF="001460_0149_0FB34BFCF0E02178"/>
<HI>Endowing</HI> of these, or the <HI>Maintaining</HI> of them, is, <HI>At once to Do Good unto many.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas, how much of the <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> in the World, is buried in Hands, where 'tis little better than convey'd back to the <HI>Mines</HI> from whence it came? Or Employ'd unto as little purpose, as what arrives at <HI>Indostan,</HI> where a large part of the <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> of the World, is after a Circulation carried as unto a Fatal Center, and by the <HI>Moguls</HI> lodg'd in Subser∣raneous Caves, never to see the light any more. <HI>Talia non facit bonae Fidei ac spei Christianus.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes there may be got ready for the Press, Elaborate Composures, of Great <HI>Bulk,</HI> and Greater <HI>Worth,</HI> by which the best Interests of <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> may be considerably Served in the World; [Perhaps, what may be called, as the <HI>Ostapla</HI> of <HI>Origen</HI> was, <HI>Opus Ecclesiae:</HI>] they ly like the impotent Man at the Pool of <HI>Bethesda;</HI> and there they are like to ly, till God inspire Some Wealthy Persons, to Sub∣scribe nobly for their Publication, and by this Gene∣rous Application of their Wealth to bring them abroad▪ The <HI>Names</HI> of such Noble Benefactors to Mankind, ought to <HI>Live,</HI> as long as the <HI>Works</HI> themselves; where the <HI>Works</HI> do any Good, what these have done towards the Publishing of them, <HI>Ought to be told for a Memorial of them.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, I will carry the matter further than so. The Saying may seem to carry some Affront in it; <HI>Idle Gentlemen and Idle Beggars, are the Posts of the Common Wealth.</HI> But they that are offended must quarrel with the Ashes of a Bishop. T'was Dr. <HI>Sandersons.</HI> Will you then think, Sirs, of some Honourable and Agreeable Employments? I will mention one. The <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> forbad mens eating their own Brains; or keeping their good Thoughts to themselves. Tis an Observation of the Incomparable <HI>Boyl,</HI> <Q>That as to <HI>Religious Books</HI> in
<PB N="149" REF="001460_0150_0FB34BFFE3DF3270"/>
general, it has been Observed, That those Penn'd by <HI>Lay men,</HI> and especially <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> have <HI>(Caeteris Paribus)</HI> been better Entertained, and more Effectu∣al than those of <HI>Ecclesiasticks.</HI></Q> We all know, His own were so. It is no rare thing for Men of Quality, to accomplish themselves in <HI>Languages</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> until they have been Prodigies of Literature. Their <HI>Li∣braries</HI> too, have been Stupendous Collections; ap∣proaching towards <HI>Vatican</HI> or <HI>Bodleian</HI> Dimensions. An <HI>English Gentleman</HI> has been sometimes the most <HI>Accomplish'd Thing in the whole World.</HI> How many of these (besides a <HI>Leigh,</HI> a <HI>Wolsely,</HI> or a <HI>Polhil,</HI>) have been <HI>Benefactors</HI> to Mankind by their incomparable Wri∣tings? It were mightily to be wish'd, That <HI>Rich Men,</HI> and Persons of an Elevated Condition, would Qualify themselves, for the use of the <HI>Pen,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Sword;</HI> and by their <HI>Pen</HI> deserve to have it said of them, <HI>They have Written Excellent things.</HI> An Eng∣lish <HI>Person of Quality</HI> in a Book of his Entituled, <HI>A View of the Soul,</HI> has a Passage, which I will Address you with. Sayes he, <HI>It is certainly, the Highest Dignity, if not the Greatest Happiness, Humane Nature is capable of, here in the vale below, to have the Soul so far enlightned as to become the Mirror, or Conduit, or Conveyer of Gods Truth to others.</HI> It is an Ill Motto for Men of Capacity, <HI>My Vnderstanding is Vnfruitful,</HI> Gentlemen, Consider what <HI>Subjects</HI> may most Properly &amp; Usefully fall under your <HI>Cultivation.</HI> Your <HI>Pen</HI> will Stab <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Wickedness,</HI> with an Efficacy beyond other mens: If out of your <HI>Tribe</HI> there come those who <HI>handle the Pen of the Writer,</HI> they will do uncommon Execution. One of them has ingeniously told you; <HI>Tho' I know some Functions, yet I know no Truths of Religion, like the Shew bread;</HI> Matth. 12.4 only for the Priests.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="001460_0151_0FB34C016780A008"/>I will address you, with one PROPOSAL, more. Tis, That you would [As <HI>Ambrosius</HI> had his <HI>Origen,</HI>] wisely chuse a <HI>Friend</HI> of Shining A∣bilities, of Hearty Affections, and of Excellent Piety: A <HI>Minister</HI> of such a Character, if it may be. And Entreat him, yea, Oblige him, to <HI>Study</HI> for you, and <HI>Suggest</HI> to you, <HI>Opportunities to Do Good:</HI> make him, as I may say, your <HI>Monitor.</HI> Let him Advise you from time to time, what <HI>Good</HI> you may do. Cause him to see, that he never gratifies you more, than by his Advice upon this Incention. If a <HI>David</HI> have a <HI>Seer</HI> to do such a Good Office for him, and be on the <HI>Look out</HI> for to find out what Good he may do, what Services may be done for the <HI>Temple</HI> of God in the World▪</P>
<P>There seems no Need of adding any thing but this. When <HI>Gentlemen</HI> occasionally come toge∣ther, why should not their <HI>Conversation</HI> be agree∣able to their Superiour Quality? Methinks they should reckon it beneath People of their Qua∣lity to Employ their <HI>Conversation</HI> with one ano∣ther on trifling <HI>Impertinencies;</HI> or at such a rate, that if their Discourse were taken down in short∣hand by one behind the Hangings, they would blush to have it Repeated unto them. <HI>Nihil sed Nugae, et Risus, et verba proferuntur in ventum.</HI> Sirs, It becomes a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> to Entertain his Company, with the Finest <HI>Thoughts,</HI> on the Finest <HI>Themes!</HI> But certainly, there cannot be any Subject so worthy of a <HI>Gentleman</HI> as this; <HI>What Good there is to be done in the World?</HI> Were this
<PB N="151" REF="001460_0152_0FB34C02E0F45720"/>
noble Subject oftner Started in the Conversation of <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> an incredible Deal of <HI>Good</HI> would be done.</P>
<P>I will conclude with Saying, you must <HI>come forth</HI> to any <HI>Publick Service</HI> whereof you may be capable, when you are call'd unto it. Honest <HI>Jeans</HI> has a Pungent Passage; <HI>The World applauds the Politick Retiredness of those that bury their Parts and Gifts, in an obscure Privacy, tho' both from God and Man, they have a fair call to Publick Employ∣ment; But the terrible censure of these men by Christ at the last Day, will discover them to be the arrantest Fools, that ever were upon the Face of the Earth.</HI> That Fault of not Employing ones Parts for the Publick, One calls, <HI>A Great Sacriledge in the Tem∣ple of the God of Nature.</HI> It was a Sad Age, where∣in <HI>Tacitus</HI> tells, <HI>Inertia fuit Sapientia.</HI></P>
<P N="20">§ 20. YOu may Remember, That One of the First of our PROPOSALS was, For EVERY ONE, to consider, <HI>What is there that I may do for the Service of God, and the Welfare of Man?</HI> Tis to be Expected, That all OFFICERS, <HI>As such,</HI> will conform, to what has been thus Proposed. It should be the concern of all <HI>Offi∣cers,</HI> from the <HI>Emperour</HI> to the <HI>Enomotarch, To do all the Good they can.</HI> So then, there is the less Need of making a more Particular Application to <HI>Lesser Officers</HI> of several Sorts, who have <HI>Opportu∣nities to Do Good,</HI> more or less, in every one of their hands. However, they shall not All of
<PB N="152" REF="001460_0153_0FB34C046418FF50"/>
them, complain that we have Neglected them.</P>
<P>In the CHURCH, sometimes there are <HI>Elders,</HI> (as in the Primitive Times, <HI>Ecclesia Seniores habuit,</HI>) who <HI>Rule well, tho' they Labour not in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> It becomes these often to consider; <HI>What shall I do, to prevent the rise of Strife, or of any Sin, that may be a Root of Bitterness in the Flock? And, that Christ, and Holi∣ness may Reign in it; and the Pastor have his Mini∣stry Countenanced, Encouraged, and Prospered?</HI> Their <HI>Visits</HI> of the Flock, and their Endeavours to <HI>Pre∣pare</HI> People for <HI>Special Ordinances,</HI> may be of un∣known Advantage to Religion.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Deacons,</HI> Entrusted with the <HI>Temporal Affairs</HI> of the Society. It would be well, if these would oftner consider; <HI>What may I do, that the Treasury of Christ may be increased?</HI> And, <HI>What may I do, that the Life of my faithful Pastor may be more comfortable to him!</HI> And, <HI>whom of the Flock do I think defective in their Contributions to Support the Evangelical Interests, and what shall I Speak with Great Boldness in the Faith unto them?</HI></P>
<P>In the STATE, there are many <HI>Officers,</HI> to whom the most Significant and Comprehensive PROPOSAL, that can be made, would be, <HI>To Consider their</HI> OATHES? If they would Seri∣ously <HI>Ponder,</HI> and faithfully <HI>Perform,</HI> what their <HI>Oathes,</HI> oblige 'em to, a Deal of <HI>Good</HI> would be done.</P>
<P>But we must a little Particularize.</P>
<P>The <HI>Representatives</HI> of any Place; as
<PB N="153" REF="001460_0154_0FB34C05E066EFE8"/>
they have Opportunities to <HI>Do Good</HI> for the whole People; and should accordingly think, <HI>What Motions to make?</HI> So they should be Particularly Sollicitous for the <HI>Good</HI> of that Place, which has Elected them.</P>
<P>Those whom we call, The <HI>Select-men</HI> of a Town, will fail a just Expectation, if they do not inquisitively consider this Point; <HI>What shall I do, that I may be a Blessing to the Town, which I am now to Serve?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Grand-Iury-men,</HI> may very profitably Consider; <HI>What Growing Evils or Nusance, do I discover, whereof I shall do well to Procure a Presen∣tation?</HI> They should hold their <HI>Consultations,</HI> upon this matter, as Men in Earnest for the <HI>Good</HI> of the Country.</P>
<P>Indeed, all <HI>Jury-men</HI> should be, <HI>Boni Homines,</HI> that is to Say, <HI>Good Men.</HI> Our Old Compellati∣on of a Neighbour, by the Title, of, <HI>Goodman,</HI> was of this Original; As much as to say, One Qualified to <HI>Serve on a Jury.</HI> But then, let them <HI>Do Good;</HI> and Contrive, How they may do it.</P>
<P>Why should <HI>Constables</HI> be Excused! Their Name, <HI>[Constabularius]</HI> first came, from the care of <HI>Making unruly Horses to Stand well together in the Stable.</HI> Sirs, Tis very much <HI>Good</HI> that you have to do, by being <HI>Masters of Restraint,</HI> in your Walks, and otherwise, unto <HI>unruly Cattle.</HI> What are Vi∣cious People, (tho' Perhaps <HI>in Honour,</HI>) but <HI>like the Beasts?</HI> Well-disposed <HI>Constables</HI> in a Place, have done wondrous Things, to keep up <HI>Good

Order</HI> in it. Your Thoughts on, <HI>What Good may I do?</HI> And, your <HI>Consultations,</HI> I beseech you!</P>
<P>And where <HI>Tithing-men</HI> are Chosen and Sworn, 'tis more than a little <HI>Good,</HI> which they may do, if they will conscientiously do their <HI>Duty.</HI> Let them Study well the <HI>Laws,</HI> which lay down their <HI>Duty;</HI> and let them also often Consider, <HI>What Good may I do?</HI> And consult with one ano∣ther at certain times, to find out what they have to do, and assist and strengthen one another, in the doing of it.</P>
<P>I have done with the <HI>Civil List.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Military Commanders,</HI> have their Op∣portunities to <HI>Do Good.</HI> They do it very much, when they uphold <HI>Exercises of Piety,</HI> in their seve∣ral <HI>Regiments</HI> and <HI>Companies.</HI> And when they Rebuke the <HI>Vices of the Camp,</HI> with a due Severity. Might not <HI>Societies to Suppress those Vices,</HI> be formed in the Camp, to very Good Purpose, under their Inspection? — But if the <HI>Souldiers</HI> ask, <HI>What shall we do?</HI> All my Answer at present, is only; <HI>Sirs, Consider what you have to do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Commanders at Sea,</HI> have their Op∣portunities too. The more <HI>Absolute</HI> they are in their Command, the Greater their Opportuni∣ties. The <HI>Worship of God</HI> Seriously &amp; Constant∣ly Maintained aboard, will be of <HI>Good</HI> conse∣quence. A <HI>Body of Good Orders,</HI> hung up in the Steeridge, and carefully Executed, may prove that which all the People of the Vessel may at last see cause to be very thankful for. <HI>Books of

Piety</HI> should also be taken aboard, and the men be call'd upon to Retire for the Perusal thereof, and for other Pious Actions.</P>
<P>But while our Book seems to have so far dis∣charged its Office and Purpose of, <HI>A Counsellor,</HI> as to leave no further Expectations, there Present themselves a Considerable Number of Persons, who may justly Complain of it, if among PRO∣POSALS to <HI>Do Good,</HI> they be left Unconsidered. Some whom we do not find among them that Addressed the Blessed <HI>Morning-Star</HI> of our Savi∣our, for his Direction, yet are now found among those who Enquire; <HI>And what shall we do?</HI> The Gentlemen of the LAW, who have that in their hands, the End whereof is, <HI>To Do Good;</HI> and the Perversion of which from its Professed End, is one of the <HI>Worst of Evils.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen, Your Opportunities to <HI>Do Good,</HI> are such, and so Liberal, and Gentlemanly, is your Education, [For even for the Common Pleaders at the Bar, I hope, that Maxim of the Law, will not be forgotten; <HI>Dignitas Advocato∣rum non patitur ut in eām recipiatur, qui antea fuerat Vilioris Conditionis:</HI>] that PROPOSALS of what you <HI>may do,</HI> cannot but Promise themselves an Obliging Reception with you.

in the World, That there never was known un∣der the Cope of Heaven, a more Learned man, than the Incomparable ALSTEDIUS. He has Written on every one of the Subjects in the whole <HI>Circle of Learning,</HI> as Accurately and as Exquisite∣ly as those men, who have spent all their Lives in Cultivating but any one of the Subjects. The only Reason, why his Composures are no more Esteemed, is, the <HI>Pleonasm</HI> of his Worth, and their Deserving so much Esteem.

It is odd, that when one Title of the <HI>Law</HI> is, <HI>Of the Signification of words,</HI> the great Interpreter of it, should leave it as a Maxim, <HI>De Verbebus non curat Juris Consultus.</HI> However, a <HI>Bartolus</HI> has not so Roughen'd your Study, as a <HI>Budaeas</HI> has Polish'd it.</P>
<P>But, Sirs, When you are called upon to be <HI>Wise,</HI> the main Intention is, <HI>That you may be wise to do Good.</HI> Without a Disposition for this, <HI>Doth not their Excellency which is in them go away? They Dy even without Wisdom.</HI> A Foundation of <HI>Piety</HI> must be first laid; An Inviolable Respect unto the <HI>Holy and Just and Good Laws</HI> of the Infinite GOD. This must be the Rule of all your Actions; and it must particularly Regulate your <HI>Practice of the Law.</HI> You are sensible, that it was ever the Style of the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> to begin, <HI>A Deo Optimo Maximo.</HI> Nor was it unusual for the In∣struments of the Law, to begin with ΧRgr;, the two first Letters, abbreviating the Name of ΧΡΙΣΤΟʗ, for which the Notaries have ignorantly Substi∣tuted an [X.P.] of later Times. The Life of the <HI>Lawyer</HI> should have its beginning there, and be

carried on with an Eye thither. The Old <HI>Saxon Laws,</HI> had the TEN Great Precepts of the <HI>De∣calogue</HI> prefixed in the Front of them: <HI>Ten Words,</HI> in <HI>two Tables</HI> of infinitely more Account than the Famous <HI>Twelve Tables,</HI> that were so admired by <HI>Tully,</HI> and by other Antiquity; in the Fragments whereof collected by your <HI>Balduin</HI> and others, there are yet some things horribly Unrighteous and Barbarous. These are to be the <HI>First Laws</HI> with you: and as all the <HI>Laws</HI> that are contrary to these, are <HI>ipso facto</HI> null and void; So in the <HI>Practice of the Law,</HI> every thing that is Disallow'd by these, is to be avoided. The man whom the Scripture calls, <HI>A Lawyer,</HI> was a <HI>Karaite,</HI> or one who kept close to the <HI>Written Law</HI> of God, in opposition to the <HI>Pharisee,</HI> and the <HI>Traditionist.</HI> I know not why every <HI>Lawyer,</HI> should not still be in the best sense, a <HI>Karaite.</HI> By Expressing a <HI>Reverence for the Divine Law,</HI> both that of <HI>Reason,</HI> and that of superadded <HI>Gospel,</HI> you will <HI>Do Good</HI> in the world, beyond what you can imagine. You will Redeem your honourable Profession from the wrong which <HI>Ill Men</HI> have done to the Reputation of it; And you will obtain another Patronage for it, than what the Satyr in the Idle Story of your Saint <HI>Evona</HI> has assigned it.</P>
<P>Your Celebrated <HI>Ulpian,</HI> wrote Seven Books, to show the several <HI>Punishments,</HI> which ought to be inflicted on <HI>Christians.</HI> It is to be hoped, that you will invent as many <HI>Services</HI> to be done unto the <HI>Cause of Christianity;</HI> Services to be done for

<P>I am not sure, our <HI>Tertullian</HI> was the Gentle∣man of that Name, who hath some <HI>Consulta</HI> in the Roman <HI>Digesta:</HI> Some writers of his Life (as well as <HI>Grotius</HI>) will not have it so. Yet <HI>Euse∣bius</HI> tells us, he was well skilled in the <HI>Roman Laws.</HI> And in his Writings you have many <HI>Law-terms;</HI> particularly, <HI>Prescriptions</HI> (the Title of his Treatises against <HI>Hereticks</HI>) were, as we learn from <HI>Quintilian</HI> and others, the <HI>Replies</HI> of <HI>Defendents,</HI> to the Actions of the <HI>Plaintiffs.</HI> I pro∣pose, That others of the Faculty, Study all pos∣sible <HI>Prescriptions</HI> against them, who would hurt Christianity, and <HI>Apologies</HI> for the Church and Cause of our Saviour. But, Sirs, It must first of all be done, in your own Vertuous, Exact, Upright Conduct, under all Temptations.</P>
<P>The Miscarrriages of some Individuals, must not bring a Blemish, on a Noble and Useful Profession.</P>
<P>But many will be ready enough, to allow of a Censure occurring in a late Book Entituled, <HI>Examen Miscellaneum:</HI> (and I know scarce any thing else worth Quoting from it:) <HI>A Lawyer that is a Knave, deserves Death, more than a Band of Robbers; for he Profanes the Sanctuary of the Di∣stressed, and Betrayes the Liberties of the People.</HI> To¦ward off such a Censure, a <HI>Lawyer</HI> must shun all those <HI>Indirect Ways</HI> of <HI>Making Hast to be Rich,</HI> in

Sir, Be prevailed withal, to keep constantly a <HI>Court of Chancery</HI> in your own Breast; and Scorn and Fear to do any thing, but what your <HI>Con∣science</HI> will pronounce, Consistent with, yea, Conducing to, <HI>Glory to God in the Highest, on Earth Peace, Good-will towards men.</HI> The very Nature of your Business, leads you to Meditations on a <HI>Judgment to come.</HI> Oh! That you would so Rea∣lize and Antedate that <HI>Judgment,</HI> as to do no∣thing, but what you may verily Believe, will be approved in it!</P>
<P>This Piety must Operate very particularly, in the <HI>Pleading of Causes.</HI> You will abhor, Sir, to appear in a <HI>Dirty Cause.</HI> If you discern, that your <HI>Client</HI> has an <HI>Unjust Cause,</HI> you will faith∣fully advise him of it. <HI>Utrum Fallacijs et Decep∣tionibus ad Convincendum Adversarium uti Liceat?</HI> This is the Question.

<P>I cannot Encourage any Gentleman, to spend much Time in the Study of the <HI>Canon-Law:</HI> which <HI>Baptista á Sancto Blasio,</HI> finds to Contradict the <HI>Civil Law</HI> in Two Hundred Instances.

<P>You shall have some of my PROPOSALS for it, in an Historical Exhibition. In the Life of Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> there is related this Passage concerning his Father, who was a <HI>Lawyer</HI></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="001460_0165_0FB34C1C66E31BD0"/><Q>That worthy man was very Singular, in Two most Imitable Practices. One was, That when any of his Neighbours, desirous to Sue one another, addressed him for <HI>Counsel,</HI> it was his manner, in the most Perswasive and Obli∣ging Terms that could be, to Endeavour a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> between both Parties; Preferring the <HI>Consolations</HI> of a <HI>Peace-maker,</HI> before all the <HI>Fees</HI> that he might have got, by blowing up of <HI>Differences.</HI> Another was, That Every Night, it was his Custom to <HI>Examine himself,</HI> with Re∣flections on the Transactions of the Day past; wherein if he found, that he had not either <HI>Done Good</HI> unto others, or <HI>Got Good</HI> unto his own Soul, he would be as much Grieved, as ever the Famous <HI>Titus</HI> was, when he could Com∣plain in the Evening, <HI>Amici, Diem per∣didi.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What a Noble Thing would it be for you, to find out Oppressed <HI>Widows,</HI> and <HI>Orphans,</HI> and such as can appear no otherwise than, <HI>In forma Pau∣peris;</HI> Objects in whose Oppression, <HI>Might over∣comes Right;</HI> and Generously <HI>Plead their Cause?

<P>Wealthy People going to make their <HI>Wills,</HI> often ask your Advice. You may take the Op∣portunity to Advise them, unto such Liberali∣ties upon <HI>Pious Uses,</HI> as may greatly advance the Kingdom of God in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="001460_0166_0FB34C1DE97C1630"/>And, when you have an Opportunity by <HI>Law</HI> to Rescue, <HI>The Things that are God</HI>'s, from the Sacrilegious Hands of the men that would <HI>Rob God,</HI> it is to be hoped, you will do it with all possible Generosity and Alacrity.</P>
<P>O Excellent Imitation of our Glorious AD∣VOCATE in the Heavens!</P>
<P>Is there nothing to be mended in the <HI>Laws?</HI> Perhaps, you may discover many things yet wanting in the <HI>Laws; Mischiefs</HI> in the Execution and Application of the <HI>Laws,</HI> which ought to be better provided against; <HI>Mischiefs</HI> annoying of Mankind, against which no <HI>Laws</HI> are yet pro∣vided. The <HI>Reformation of the Law,</HI> and more <HI>Law</HI> for the <HI>Reformation of the World,</HI> is what is mightily called for. I don't say, The <HI>Laws</HI> can be so <HI>Reduced,</HI> that like those of <HI>Geneva,</HI> Five Sheets of Paper may hold them all; but certainly the <HI>Laws</HI> may be so <HI>Corrected,</HI> that the World may more Sensibly and Generally feel the Be∣nefit of them. If some <HI>Lawyers</HI> that are <HI>Men of an Excellent spirit,</HI> would Employ their Thoughts this way, and bring their Thoughts to pass in a <HI>Parlaimentary</HI> way, all the World might fare the better for them.

<P>I must now break off.</P>
<P>If you be called, Sir, to the Administration of Justice, in the Quality of a <HI>Iudge,</HI> you will prescribe to your self <HI>Rules,</HI> like those, which the Renowned Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hale,</HI> so Religi∣ously observed, as to become a bright Example for all that Sit in the Seat of Judicature. The Sum of his, were;</P>
<Q><P>That Justice be administred, <HI>Uprightly, De∣liberately, Resolutely.</HI></P>
<P>That I rest not on my own <HI>Understanding,</HI> but implore the <HI>Direction</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>That in the Execution of Justice, I carefully lay aside my own <HI>Passions,</HI> and not give way to them, however provoked.</P>
<P>That I be wholly Intent on the Business I am about.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="001460_0168_0FB34C226802BCA0"/>That I suffer not my self to be Prepossessed with any Judgment at all, till all the Business, and both Parties are heard.</P></Q>

<P N="21">§ 21. <HI>REforming-Societies,</HI> or <HI>Societies for the Suppression of Disorders,</HI> have begun to grow somewhat into Fashion; and it is one of the best <HI>Omens</HI> that the World has upon it. <HI>Behold, how great a Matter a little</HI> of this Hea∣venly <HI>Fire</HI> may Kindle! Five or Six Gentlemen in <HI>London,</HI> began with an Heroic Resolution, &amp; Association, to Encounter the Torrent of Wick∣edness, which was carrying all before it in the Nation. More were soon added unto them; and tho' they met with great Opposition, from <HI>Wicked Spirits,</HI> and these <HI>Incarnate</HI> as well as <HI>In∣visible,</HI> and some in <HI>High Places</HI> too, yet they pro∣ceeded with a most honourable and invincible Courage. Their <HI>Success,</HI> if not proportionable to their <HI>Courage,</HI> yet was far from <HI>Contemptible.</HI> In the <HI>Punishments</HI> inflicted on them who trans∣gressed
<PB N="168" REF="001460_0169_0FB34C26208E4638"/>
the Laws of <HI>Good Morality,</HI> there were soon offered many Thousands of <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> unto the Holiness of GOD. Hundreds of <HI>Houses</HI> which were the <HI>Chambers</HI> of Hell, and the <HI>Scandals</HI> of Earth, were soon Extinguished. There was a Remarkable Check soon given to raging <HI>Profa∣nity;</HI> and the <HI>Lords-Day</HI> was not openly and hor∣ribly Profaned as formerly. And among other <HI>Essays to Do Good,</HI> they Scattered Thousands of <HI>Good Books,</HI> that had a Tendency to Reform the Evil Manners of the People. It was not long before this Excellent Example was followed in other parts of the <HI>British</HI> Empire. Vertuous men of diverse Qualities and Perswasions, became the Members of the <HI>Societies:</HI> Persons High and Low, Con and Non-con, United; the Union became Formidable to the Kingdom of Darkness. The Report of the <HI>Societies</HI> flew over the Seas; the Pattern was follow'd in other Country's; Men of Wisdom in Remote Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> have made their joyful Remark upon them, <HI>That they cause Unspeakable Good, &amp; annunciate a more illustrious State of the Church of God, which is to be Expected, in the Conversion of Jews and Gentiles. America</HI> too, begins to be Irradiated with them!</P>
<P>I will Recite an Account formerly offered unto the Publick, of what may be done by such <HI>Societies.</HI></P>
<Q><P>What incredible Advantages would arise unto <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> from <HI>Reforming-Societies,</HI> if the Disposition to them should not fall under unhappy Languishments? And if <HI>Religion</HI> flourish, and <HI>Iniquity</HI> dare no longer

show its Head, what <HI>Prosperity</HI> of every Kind, &amp; in every Thing, would be the Consequence: A small <HI>Society</HI> may prove an Incomparable and Invaluable Blessing to a Town, whose Welfare shall become the Object of their Watchful Enquiries: They may be as a <HI>Gar∣rison</HI> to defend it from the worst of its Enemies: They may quickly render it, <HI>A Mountain of Holiness, and a Dwelling of Righteousness,</HI> that shall Enjoy the most Gracious Presence of the Lord. The <HI>Society</HI> may do Considerable things towards the Execution of Whole∣some <HI>Laws,</HI> whereby <HI>Vice</HI> is to be discouraged. <HI>Of∣fendors</HI> against those <HI>Laws</HI> may be kept under such a Vigilant Inspection, that they shall not escape a due <HI>Chastisement</HI> for their Offences. The Effects of such a Chastisement may be, that the Rebuked and Cen∣sured Sinners will be Reclamed from their Sins; or, however, the Judgments of God, which would break forth where such things are Indulged, will be Di∣verted. <HI>Ʋbi Judicium, ibi non est Judicium. Swearing</HI> and <HI>Cursing</HI> will not infect the <HI>Air;</HI> Men will not Reel along the Streets, turn'd into <HI>Swine</HI> by their <HI>Cups.</HI> The Cages of <HI>Ʋnclean Birds</HI> will be dissipated. They whom <HI>Idleness</HI> renders Dead while they Live, will have an Honest Employment ordered for them, whereby they may Earn an Honest Livelihood And the <HI>Lords-Day</HI> will Visibly be kept <HI>Holy to the Lord;</HI> which one thing will soon Irradiate a Place, with a most lovely <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Happiness. Vice</HI> is a Cowardly Thing; it will wonderfully shrink before those that will Visibly go to make Head against it. If any <HI>Laws</HI> to Regu∣late what is amiss, be yet wanting, the <HI>Society</HI> may procure the <HI>Legislature Power</HI> to be so address'd, that all due Provision will soon be made by our Law-gi∣vers. What is Defective in the <HI>By-Laws</HI> of the Town, may be by the <HI>Society,</HI> so observed, that the Town shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and the thing redressed. The
<PB N="170" REF="001460_0171_0FB34C292ACF4638"/>
Choice of such <HI>Officers</HI> as may be Faithful and Use∣ful to the Publick, may be very much influenced by the <HI>Society.</HI> If any sort of Men, are notoriously De∣fective in their Duty, the <HI>Society</HI> may by directing <HI>Admonitions</HI> and <HI>Remonstrances</HI> unto them soon procure the Defects to be amended. If any <HI>Families</HI> live without <HI>Family-Worship,</HI> the <HI>Society</HI> may tell their <HI>Pastor</HI> of them, and pray him to Visit them, and Exhort them, and Perswade them, to continue no longer in their <HI>Paganism</HI> and <HI>Atheism;</HI> or, if any are like to be Led away by Seducers, or other Temptations, a Care may in this way be taken of them. <HI>Schools</HI> of all Kinds, may in many Kinds fare the better for the <HI>Society;</HI> [And <HI>Charity-Schools</HI> be Erected, Inspected, and Supported.] BOOKS that have in them the <HI>Salt</HI> of Heaven, may by means of the <HI>Society</HI> be Sprinkled all over the Land; and the <HI>Savour of Truth</HI> be dispersed about the Countrey. Finally; The <HI>So∣ciety</HI> may find out, who are in Extreme Necessities, and may either by their own Liberality, or by that of others to whom they shall Commend the matter, ob∣tain Succours for the Necessitous.</P>
<P>We know, That a Small <HI>Society</HI> may do such Things, because to our Knowledge, it has already done them; and yet, it has been concealed from the Knowledge of the world, who they were which did them. And with Minds that have any <HI>Generosity</HI> or <HI>Ingenuity</HI> in them, Elevating them above the <HI>Dregs of Mankind,</HI> there will need no other Argument for the Production of such a <HI>Society,</HI> than the Prospect of such Excellent Things. These are Things that will Mightily Commend themselves unto the Thoughts of Well-inclined men; and they will Easily see it their <HI>Honour,</HI> to be of a <HI>Society</HI> that will Pursue such Excellent Ends.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="171" REF="001460_0172_0FB34C2C2887E290"/>The Repetition of these Passages, is enough to make way for the PROPOSAL;</P>
<P>That a Fit Number in a Neighbourhood, whose Hearts God has touched with a <HI>Zeal to Do Good,</HI> would Combine into a <HI>Society,</HI> to meet, when &amp; where they shall agree; and Consider that Case, <HI>What are the <HI>Disorders</HI> that we may fee Rising among us? And what may be done, either by our selves immediately, or by others thro' our Advice, to Sup∣press those Disorders?</HI> That they would obtain if they can, the Presence of a <HI>Minister</HI> with them; and every time they meet, have a <HI>Prayer</HI> wherein the Glorious Lord shall be call'd upon, to Bless the Design, Direct and Prosper it. That they would also have a <HI>Justice of Peace,</HI> if it may be, to be a Member of the Society. That they once in half a Year Choose two <HI>Stewards,</HI> to dispatch the <HI>Businesses</HI> and <HI>Messages</HI> of the <HI>Society,</HI> and manage the <HI>Votes</HI> in it; who shall Nominate unto the <HI>Society</HI> their Successors, when their Term is Ex∣pired. That they would have a Faithful <HI>Trea∣surer,</HI> in whose Hands their <HI>Stock of Charity</HI> may be deposited: And a <HI>Clerk,</HI> to keep a conveni∣ent <HI>Record</HI> of <HI>Transactions</HI> and <HI>Purposes.</HI> And, fi∣nally, That they do with as <HI>Modest</HI> and <HI>Silent</HI> a Conduct as may be, carry on all their Under∣takings.</P>
<P>In a Town accommodated with several such <HI>Societies,</HI> it has been an Usage, that <HI>Once a Year,</HI> they have met, all of them together, in one Place, and have had a <HI>Day of Prayer,</HI> in which
<PB N="172" REF="001460_0173_0FB34C2DA2209280"/>
they have <HI>Humbled</HI> themselves for doing so little Good, and besought the <HI>Pardon</HI> of their <HI>Unfruit∣fulness,</HI> thro' the Blood of the <HI>Great Sacrifice;</HI> and implored the <HI>Blessing</HI> of Heaven on the <HI>Essays to Do Good,</HI> which they have made, and the <HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>Conduct</HI> of Heaven, for their further Essays; and such Influences of Heaven, as may bring a∣bout those <HI>Reformations,</HI> which it was not in their Power to accomplish.</P>
<P>I will finish the PROPOSAL, by Reciting the <HI>Points of Consideration</HI> which the SO∣CIETIES may have Read unto them from time to time at their Meetings, with a due <HI>Pause</HI> upon each of them, for any one to offer what he please upon it.</P>
<Q><P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> IS there any <HI>Remarkable Disorder</HI> in the Place, that requires our Endeavour for the Suppres∣sion of it? And in what Good, Fair, likely way, may we Endeavour it?</P>

of Some Nations that are yet <HI>Ungospellized,</HI> and wait on the Providence of Heaven, to lead them to, and own them in, Some <HI>Apostolical Undertak∣ings,</HI> who can tell what might be done? We know, what <HI>Ruffinus</HI> relates concerning the Con∣version of the <HI>Iberians;</HI> and what <HI>Socrates,</HI> con∣cerning the Things done by <HI>Frumentius</HI> and <HI>Aede∣sius,</HI> in the <HI>Inner India.</HI></P>
<P>But on this <HI>Desireable</HI> there are Two Things <HI>Remarkable.</HI></P>
<P>First, It is the conjecture of some <HI>Seers,</HI> That until the <HI>Temple</HI> be <HI>cleansed,</HI> there will be no Ge∣neral Appearance of the <HI>Nations</HI> to worship in it. And the Truth is, There will be Danger, until then, that many Persons Active in <HI>Societies for the Propagation of Religion,</HI> may be more intent upon Propagating their own Little <HI>Forms</HI> and <HI>Fancies</HI> and <HI>Interests,</HI> than the more <HI>Weighty matters of the Gospel.</HI> Yea, t'wil be well, if they be not unawares imposed upon, to hurt <HI>Christianity</HI> where 'tis well-Established, while places wholly <HI>Ungospellized</HI> in the Neighbourhood may ly neg∣lected. Let us therefore do what we can to∣wards the Churches <HI>Reformation,</HI> in order to its <HI>Dilatation.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, It is probable, That the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> in Operations, like those of the First Ages, where∣by Christianity was first <HI>Planted,</HI> will be again conferred from our <HI>Ascended Lord,</HI> for the <HI>Spread∣ing</HI> of it. The <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> who has withdrawn from the <HI>Apostate Church,</HI> will come, and <HI>Abide</HI>

By Him, God shall <HI>Dwell with men.</HI> Would not the <HI>Heavenly Father give His Holy Spirit,</HI> if it were more <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> of Him!</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> 'Tis Lamentable to See the <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Wickedness,</HI> yet remaining, even in many parts of the <HI>British</HI> Dominions: In <HI>Wales;</HI> in the <HI>High-Lands;</HI> and in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Are the <HI>Gouges</HI> all Dead? There are pretended <HI>Shepherds,</HI> in the World, that will never be able to Answer before the Son of God, for their Laying so little to Heart, the <HI>Deplorable</HI> Circumstances, of so many People, whom they might, if they were not Scandalously Negligent, bring to be more Acquainted with the only Saviour. And there might be more done, that some of the <HI>American</HI> Colonies, may no longer be such <HI>Cimmerian</HI> ones?</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Why is no more done, for the Poor <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> and <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and other Christi∣ans, who have little <HI>Preaching,</HI> and no <HI>Printing</HI> among them? If we sent <HI>Bibles,</HI> and <HI>Psalters,</HI> and other <HI>Books of Piety</HI> among them, in their own Languages, they would be <HI>Noble</HI> Presents, and, God knowes, how <HI>Useful</HI> ones!</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Poor <HI>Sailours,</HI> and Poor <HI>Souldiers,</HI> call for our Pity. They meet with <HI>Great and Sore Troubles.</HI> Their <HI>Manners</HI> are too commonly such, as dis∣cover no very Good Effects of their <HI>Troubles.</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="001460_0179_0FB34C39A3DAA660"/>
What shall be done to make them a <HI>better sort of men?</HI> There must, besides more <HI>Books of Piety</HI> distributed among them, other methods be tho't upon; <HI>Cadit Asinus et est qui sublevat. Perit Anima, et non est qui manum apponat!</HI> Let <HI>Austin</HI> awaken us.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> The <HI>Trades-mans Library</HI> needs to be more Enriched. We have seen, <HI>Husbandry Spiritualiz∣ed;</HI> and, <HI>Shepherdy Spiritualized;</HI> and, <HI>Navigation Spiritualized;</HI> We have seen, the <HI>Weaver</HI> also ac∣commodated, with agreeable Meditations. To Spread the <HI>Nets of Salvation</HI> for men, in the ways of their <HI>Personal Callings,</HI> and convey Good Thoughts unto them, in the <HI>Terms</HI> and <HI>Steps,</HI> of their Daily Business, is a Real Service to the In∣terests of Piety. A BOOK also, that shall be an <HI>Onomatologia Monitoria,</HI> and shall advise People how to make their <HI>Names</HI> become unto them, the <HI>Monitors</HI> of their Duty; might be of much use to the <HI>Christened</HI> World. And, a BOOK, that shall be, <HI>The Angel of Bethesda,</HI> and shall in∣struct People how to improve in agreeable Points of Piety, from the several Maladies, which their <HI>Bodies</HI> may be Diseased withal; and at the same time, inform them of the most Experimented, Natural, Specifick <HI>Remedies</HI> for their Diseases, might be very useful to Mankind. These Two Subjects, if not undertaken by any other Hand, may be so shortly by that which now Writes; Except the Glorious Lord of my Life, immedi∣ately put an End unto it; and <HI>my Dayes are past, my Purposes are broken off, even the Thoughts of my Heart!</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="179" REF="001460_0180_0FB34C3B851934D0"/><HI>VI.

<P>Let the <HI>Charity-Schools</HI> also, <HI>Increase and Mul∣tiply; Charity-Schools,</HI> which may provide Sub∣jects for the Great Saviour, Blessings for the next Generation; <HI>Charity-Schools,</HI> not perverted unto the ill purposes of introducing a <HI>Defective Christi∣anity.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Those things, that so far as we <HI>understand by the Books</HI> of the Sacred Prophecies, are to be, <HI>The Works of our Day;</HI> Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> to Observe and Pursue.

<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Zeal of the Lord of Hosts will Perform these things:</HI> A <HI>Zeal</HI> inspired and produced by the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> in His Faithful Servants, will put them upon the Performance of such Things. Nothing has been yet Proposed, that is Impra∣ctible; <HI>Non Fortia Loquor, sed Possibilia.</HI> But, <HI>Eu∣sebius</HI> has taught me, <HI>Vere magnum est magna facere, et Teipsum putare nihil.</HI> Sirs, Under and After a Course of such <HI>Actions,</HI> which have a true Glory in them, and really are more Glorious than all the <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Atchievements,</HI> whereof those Bloody Plunderers, whom we call, <HI>Conqueror,</HI> have made a wretched Ostentation: and per∣haps made Inscriptions like those of <HI>Pompey</HI> on his Temple of <HI>Minerva;</HI> — Still <HI>Humility,</HI> must be the <HI>Crown</HI> of all. All, nothing without <HI>Hu∣mility;</HI> nothing without a sense that you are <HI>Nothing,</HI> a Consent to be made <HI>Nothing.</HI> You must first, most Humbly Acknowledge unto the Great GOD, <HI>That after you have done all, you are Unprofitable Servants;</HI> and make your Humble Confession, That not only you have <HI>done but that which was your Duty to do,</HI> but also that you have exceedingly fallen short of doing your <HI>Duty.</HI> If God abase you with very <HI>Dark Dispensations</HI> of His Pro∣vidence, after all your Indefatigable and your Disinteressed Essays to <HI>Glorify</HI> Him, Humble your selves before Him; yet abate nothing of your
<PB N="182" REF="001460_0183_0FB34C3FA78654F8"/>
<HI>Essays;</HI> Hold on, saying, <HI>My God will Humble me, yet will I Glorify Him. Lord, Thou art Righteous; But still I will do all I can to serve thy Glorious King∣dom.</HI> This indeed, is a more easy <HI>Humiliation;</HI> but then there is one to be demanded, of much greater Difficulty: That is, That you humbly Submit unto all the <HI>Diminutions,</HI> among <HI>Men,</HI> that God shall order for you. Your Admirable Saviour was one who <HI>went about</HI> ever <HI>Doing of Good;</HI> Mankind was never Visited by such a <HI>Bene∣factor.</HI> And yet we read, <HI>He was One spoken a∣gainst.</HI> Never any one so Vilified! Had He been the worst <HI>Malefactor</HI> in the World, He could not have been worse dealt withal. He Expostulated, <HI>For which of my Good Works is it that you treat me so?</HI> Yet they went on; They Hated Him, they Reproached Him, they Murdered Him. <HI>Austin</HI> said very truly, <HI>Remedium Elationis est contuitus Dominicae Crucis.</HI> It will also be the Remedy of Discouragement; it will keep you from <HI>Sinking,</HI> as well as being <HI>Lifted up.</HI> You are Conformed unto your Saviour, in your Watchful Endea∣vours to <HI>Do Good,</HI> and be <HI>Fruitful in every Good Work.</HI> But your Conformity unto Him, yet <HI>Lacks One thing;</HI> That is, After all, to be <HI>Despised and Rejected of Men;</HI> and Patiently to bear the Con∣tempt, and Malice, and Abuses of an <HI>Untoward Generation.</HI> One of the Fathers, who sometimes wanted a little of this Grace, could say, <HI>Nihil est quod not ita et Hominibus et Deo Gratos facit, quam si Vitae Merito magni, et Humilitate infimi simus.</HI> Tis
<PB N="183" REF="001460_0184_0FB34C43DA47BCC8"/>
an Excellent thing to come to <HI>Nothing.</HI> If you hear the Hopes of Disaffected men, to see you <HI>come to Nothing, Hear</HI> it with as much of Satis∣faction as they can <HI>Hope</HI> it. Embrace <HI>Exinani∣tions;</HI> Embrace <HI>Annihilations.</HI> I find a Zealous and Famous <HI>Doer of Good,</HI> much Affected with the Picture of a Devout man, to whom a Voice comes down from Heaven, <HI>Quid vis fieri pro te?</HI> Whereto he replies, <HI>Nihil, Domine, nisi pati et Con∣temni pro te.</HI> Sirs, Let it be seen some where else than in <HI>Picture;</HI> be you the <HI>Substance</HI> of it. Thus, <HI>Let Patience have its Perfect Work!</HI></P>
<P>I hope, you have more Discretion, than to imagine, That because you are never <HI>Weary of Well-Doing,</HI> therefore you should be Universally <HI>Well-spoken of.</HI> No; 'Twill be just the Contrary. To <HI>Do Well,</HI> and to <HI>Hear Ill,</HI> is the Common Ex∣perience, and ought to be our Constant Expe∣ctation. For this most <HI>Unreasonable</HI> thing, there are very many <HI>Reasons.</HI> 'Twill be impossible to <HI>Do much Good,</HI> but some or other will count them∣selves <HI>Hurt</HI> by what you do. You will Unavoid∣ably serve some <HI>Interests,</HI> which others are Indis∣pos'd unto. Tis also in the Nature of <HI>Mad men,</HI> to take up strange Prejudices against their <HI>Best Friends;</HI> to be set against None so much as <HI>Them.</HI> Now, we may every where see those, concern∣ing whom we are told, <HI>Madness is in their Hearts.</HI> It will appear in their being unaccountably Pre∣judiced, against those that most of all seek to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto them. Then, <HI>He teareth me in his Wrath
<PB N="184" REF="001460_0185_0FB34C44ED1371A8"/>
who hateth me; he gnasheth upon me with his Teeth; mine Enemy sharpeneth his Eyes upon me!</HI> Then, to <HI>Skorakizing</HI> a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> for nothing in the world, but because he would have been so! He shall be Honoured, as the <HI>Lindians</HI> Worshipped <HI>Her∣cules,</HI> by <HI>Cursing,</HI> and Throwing of <HI>Stones.</HI> The <HI>Wrath</HI> of God, against a Sinful and Woful World, has likewise its Operation in this Grievous mat∣ter. If men always upon <HI>Intentions</HI> and <HI>Inven∣tions</HI> to <HI>Do Good,</HI> were so Generally Belov'd and Esteem'd as they might be, they would be <HI>In∣struments</HI> of doing more <HI>Good,</HI> than the Justice of Heaven, can yet allow to be done for <HI>Such</HI> a World. <HI>The World is not worthy</HI> of them, nor do the <HI>Good</HI> that is Endeavoured by them. To de∣prive the World of that <HI>Good,</HI> they must be left unto a strange <HI>Aversion</HI> for those Men that would fain do it. This Creeples them, Fetters them, Defeats their Excellent Purposes! Nor is the <HI>Devil</HI> Idle on this Occasion. A man who shall <HI>Do much Good,</HI> will therein do much <HI>Harm</HI> unto the Empire of the <HI>Devil.</HI> It would be much, if the <HI>Devil</HI> should not <HI>seek to Devour,</HI> or take an Exquisite Revenge upon such <HI>Men of God.</HI> Ex∣cept God lay an Uncommon Restraint upon that <HI>Wicked One,</HI> such is the <HI>Power of the Adver∣sary,</HI> &amp; such an <HI>Energy</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> has upon the minds of Multitudes, that he will notably &amp; bitterly <HI>Re∣venge</HI> himself upon any Notable <HI>Doer of Good;</HI> and procure him a <HI>Troop</HI> of Enemies, Three Volleys of Obloquies. But, O Servant of God, <HI>By Him thou
<PB N="185" REF="001460_0186_0FB34C466E560F80"/>
wilt run thro' a Troop; By thy God thou wilt Leap over a Wall.</HI> We may be so far from wondring, that <HI>Wicked men</HI> are Violently Disaffected unto a man who does abundance of <HI>Good,</HI> and Spread as many Stories, and Write as many Libels, to his Disadvantage, as ever the incomparable <HI>Calvin</HI> suffered from them; we may rather wonder that the <HI>Devil</HI> does not make this world hotter than a <HI>Babylonish Furnace</HI> for him; too hot for his Abiding in it. Sirs, If you will <HI>Do much,</HI> tis very likely that the <HI>Devil</HI> may sometimes raise upon your Opportunities to <HI>Do Good,</HI> such an <HI>Horrible Tempest,</HI> as may threaten a total Ruine unto them. You may fear that you see your <HI>Serviceableness,</HI> the <HI>Apple of your Eye struck out;</HI> you may be driven to Prayers, to Tears, to <HI>Fasting often</HI> in Secret Places; Prostrate in the Dust, you must <HI>offer up your Supplications, with strong Crying and Tears,</HI> to Him that is <HI>able to Save</HI> your Op∣portunities from <HI>Death;</HI> you must Cry out, <HI>O Deliver my Soul, (my Serviceableness) from the Sword, my Darling, (my Serviceableness) from the Power of the Dog!</HI></P>
<P>The words of the Great <HI>Baxter,</HI> are Proper &amp; Worthy to be Introduced on this Occasion.</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Suggestions</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> yea, and oft his External Contrived Snares are such, as fre∣quently give men a Palpable Discovery of his Agency. Whence is it, that such wonderful Successive Trains of Impediments, are set in the way of almost any man, that intends any Great &amp; Good Work in the World? I have among men of my own Acquaintance observed
<PB N="186" REF="001460_0187_0FB34C47E22783D8"/>
such admirable Frustrations of many Designed Ex∣cellent Works, by such strange unexpected means, &amp; such variety of them, and so powerfully carried on, as hath of it self Convinced me, that there is a most Vehement Invisible Malice permitted by God to Re∣sist Mankind, and to Militate against all Good in the World. Let a man have any work of Greatest Natural Importance, which tends to no Great Benefit to Mankind, and he may go on with it, without any Extraordinary Impedition. But let him have any great Design for <HI>Common Good,</HI> in things that tend to destroy Sin, to heal Divisions, to Revive Charity, to Increase Vertue, to Save mens Souls; yea, or to the Publick Common Felicity; and his Impediments shall be so multifarious, so far-fetch'd, so subtle, so incessant, and in Despite of all his Care and Resolu∣tion, usually so Successful, that he shall seem to him∣self, to be like a man that is held fast Hand &amp; Foot, while he sees no one touch him; or that sees an hun∣dred Blocks brought and cast before him in his way, while he sees no one to do it.</Q></P>
<P>I transcribe this passage for this purpose. O Doer of Good, Expect a Conflict with <HI>Wicked Spirits in High Places,</HI> to Clog all the Good thou dost propose to do; And Expect that Restless Endeavours of Theirs, to overwhelm thee with Vile <HI>Ideas</HI> in the Minds, and <HI>Calumnies</HI> in the Mouthes, of many People concerning thee, will be some of their <HI>Devices</HI> to Defeat all thy <HI>Pro∣posals. Be not Ignorant of the Satanick Devices!</HI></P>
<P>Yea, and if the <HI>Devil</HI> were Asleep, there is Malignity Enough, in the Hearts of <HI>Wicked Men</HI> themselves, to render a man that will <HI>Do Good,</HI>

very Distastful and Uneasy to them. They are the Off-spring of him, who <HI>Slew his Brother, be∣cause his Works were Righteous;</HI> and they will Malign a man, because he is Useful to other men.

<P>I happened once to be present in the Room, where a Dying man could not Dy till he had bewayled unto a Minister whom he had now therefore sent for, the unjust <HI>Calumnies</HI> &amp; <HI>Inju∣ries</HI> which he had often cast upon him: The Mi∣nister asked the poor Penitent, what was the oc∣casion of his <HI>Abusiveness;</HI> whether he had been by any Mis-reports impos'd upon? The man made this horrible Answer; <HI>No, Sir; 'Twas nothing but this; I thought You were a Good Man, and that You did much Good in the World, and therefore I Hated You! Oh! Is it Possible, Is it Possible,</HI> (said the poor Sinner,) <HI>for such a Sinner to find a Pardon!</HI> Truly, tho' other Causes may be pretended for the <HI>Spite</HI> and <HI>Rage</HI> of Wicked men, against a <HI>Fruitful Doer of Good;</HI> Yet I shall not be <HI>Deceived,</HI> if I fear, that oftentimes a secret <HI>Antipathy</HI> to the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> lies at the Bottom of it. Or it may be some∣times a <HI>Pale Envy,</HI> in Proud men, raging that other men are more <HI>Useful</HI> in the world than they, and vexing themselves with worse than <HI>Sicilian Torments,</HI> at the sight of what God and man do for other men. <HI>They see it and are Grieved.</HI> Sirs, <HI>Non Bonus est qui non ad Invidiam usque Bonus est,</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="001460_0189_0FB34C4AE18081F0"/>
But now, for such Causes, you must not <HI>think strange of the Trial,</HI> if men <HI>Speak Evil of you,</HI> after you have <HI>Done Good</HI> unto many, yea, unto those very People who <HI>Speak</HI> it. It will not be <HI>Strange,</HI> if you should <HI>hear the Defaming of Many;</HI> If the men who do not Love the <HI>Holy Wayes</HI> of the Lord in His Churches, have no Love to you; If ne∣ver so many <HI>Aristephanes's</HI> fall upon you; If <HI>Ja∣velins</HI> are thrown at you, with a Rage reaching to Heaven; And if <HI>Pamphlets</HI> are stuff'd with vile Figments and Slanders upon you. God may wisely permit these things, and in much Faith∣fulness, <HI>To hide Pride from you. [O Quantum est venenum superbiae, quod non potest nisi veneno Curari!]</HI> Alas, while we carry the <HI>Grave-Cloathes</HI> of <HI>Pride</HI> still about us, these rough Hands are the best that can be to pull them off! If you should meet with such Things, you must bear them with much <HI>Meekness,</HI> much <HI>Silence,</HI> Great <HI>Self-Abhorrence,</HI> and a spirit to <HI>Forgive,</HI> the worst of all your Per∣secutors. <HI>Being Defamed,</HI> you must <HI>Entreat.</HI> Be Glad, if you can Redeem any Opportunities to <HI>Do Good.</HI> Be ready to <HI>Do Good,</HI> even unto those from whom you <HI>Suffer Evil.</HI> And when you have done all the <HI>Good</HI> that you can, reckon your self well Paid, if you escape as well as the <HI>Crane</HI> did from the <HI>Wolf,</HI> &amp; if you are not <HI>Punished</HI> for what you do. In short, Be insensible of any <HI>Merits</HI> in your Performances. Ly in the <HI>Dust,</HI> and be wil∣ling that both <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> should lay you there. Have your Spirit Reconciled unto <HI>Indignities.</HI>

Entertain them with all the <HI>Calmness,</HI> all the <HI>Temper,</HI> imaginable. Be content, That <HI>Three Hundred</HI> in <HI>Sparta,</HI> should be Preferr'd before you. When Envious People can fix no other Blemish on you, they will say of you, as they said of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> That <HI>You are a Proud Man;</HI> because you do not Jog on in their heavy Road of <HI>Slothfulness.</HI> Bear this also, with yet a more Profound <HI>Hu∣mility.</HI> Tis the Last Effort usually made by the Dying <HI>Pride of Life,</HI> to bear the Charge of <HI>Pride</HI> impatiently, with a <HI>Proud</HI> impatience.</P>
<P>Ye <HI>Useful Men,</HI> Your <HI>Acceptance</HI> with your Sa∣viour, and with God thro' your Saviour, and <HI>Recompence</HI> in the World to come, is to carry you Cheerfully thro' all your <HI>Essays</HI> at <HI>Usefulness.</HI> To be <HI>Reprobate for every Good Work,</HI> is a Character, from which 'twill be the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of all men, to fly with all the Dread imaginable.

God on our selves. Who so likely to <HI>Find Bles∣sings,</HI> as the men that <HI>Are Blessings?</HI> It has been said, <HI>Qui bene Vivit, semper Orat;</HI> So I will say, <HI>Qui bene Agit, bene Orat.</HI> Every <HI>Action</HI> we do for the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of God, is in the Efficacy of it, a <HI>Prayer</HI> for the <HI>Kindness</HI> of God.

While we <HI>Employ</HI> our <HI>Wits</HI> for the Interests of God, it is very probable, that we shall <HI>Sharpen</HI> them for our own. We shall become the more <HI>Wise for our selves,</HI> because we have been <HI>Wise to do Good.</HI> And of the man who is a <HI>Tree that brings forth Fruit,</HI> we read, <HI>whatsoever he doth shall Prosper.</HI> Nor can a man take a Readier way to <HI>Live Joyfully, all the Days of the Life of our Vanity which God has given us under the Sun.</HI> For, now our <HI>Life</HI> will not be thrown away in <HI>Vanity;</HI> we don't <HI>Live in Vain.</HI> My Friend, <HI>Go thy way</HI> and be Joyful; <HI>For God accepteth thy works.</HI> Our <HI>Few</HI> &amp; <HI>Evil</HI> Dayes, are made much less so, by our <HI>Do∣ing</HI> of <HI>Good</HI> in every one of them, as it rolleth over us.

The <HI>Conscience</HI> of what we do, &amp; of what we Aim to do, will be a <HI>Continual Feast</HI> unto us. <HI>Our Rejoycing is this, The Testimony of our Conscience!</HI> And, <HI>Recte fecisse Merces est.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Pleasure</HI> in doing of <HI>Good Offices,</HI> tis Inexpressible; tis Unparallel'd; tis <HI>An∣gelical;</HI> more to be Envied than any <HI>Sensual Plea∣sure;</HI> a most <HI>Refined</HI> One.

<HEAD>An Appendix; Concerning the ESSAYS that are made, for the <HI>Propagation of Religion</HI> among the Indians, in the <HI>Massachuset</HI>-Province of NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been desired, That our Book of <HI>Essays to do Good,</HI> may give an Account, of Some that are actually Pursued, on One of the most important Articles that have been proposed. The occasion for this Desire, has been given by some odd Insinuati∣ons made by some who express a Zeal for, <HI>The Propa∣gation of Religion,</HI> as if nothing had been done that way, by any People of our Profession, who readily own, <Q>That we are for Embracing &amp; Diffusing the Holy Re∣ligion of CHRIST, in the <HI>Original Purity</HI> wherein His Gospel has given it unto us, without Humane <HI>Additions</HI> &amp; <HI>Inventions.</HI></Q> Tis true, We have cause al∣wayes to blame our selves for our own <HI>Deficiencies</HI> in such a Work of God. And if we give an Account of what we have done, it must be with an Holy Shame that we have <HI>done so little. Pride,</HI> and, <HI>Vain-glorious Ostentation,</HI> Be thou at all possible Distance from the <HI>Relation,</HI> which our concern to have the Grace of God acknowledged, and a well-Designing Society of Good Men defended from Injurious Imputations, has com∣pelled us to communicate unto the World.</P>
<P>It shall be done with all the <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Brevity</HI> that the matter will allow of.</P>
<P>In the Book Entituled, <HI>Magnalia Christi Americana,</HI> or, <HI>The History of</HI> NEW-ENGLAND, there is a large
<PB N="195" REF="001460_0196_0FB34C57A8D2DDE0"/>
Account of what was <HI>formerly done,</HI> for the Christiani∣zing of our <HI>Indians.</HI> Thither we refer the Reader, for all that was <HI>formerly done:</HI> which when he Reads, he will certainly wish for more ELIOT's in the World. <HI>The present State of Christianity</HI> among them, is what must now be Reported.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Land, is not compa∣rable to what it was, in the middle of the former Cen∣tury. The Wars which after an Offered and Rejected Gospel, they perfidiously began upon the English, a∣bove Thirty years ago, brought a Quick Desolation upon whole Nations of them. All that remain under the English Influences in the <HI>Massachuset</HI>-Province, are generally recovered out of their Paganism, to some sense of the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The Christianized Indians on the two Islands of <HI>Martha's</HI> Vinyard, and <HI>Nantucket</HI> make a very consi∣derable Body. At <HI>Martha's</HI> Vinyard and <HI>Elsabeth</HI>'s Islands, there are Ten Congregations, in which a glo∣rious CHRIST is worshipped. There are Two Eng∣lishmen, and Ten Indians, that are Preachers to them, in their own Language. They have <HI>Schools</HI> also, in which their Children are taught to Read and Write; and know the Catechism. At <HI>Nantucket,</HI> there are at least Three Congregations; and more than as many Preachers.</P>
<P>From these <HI>Islands</HI> we will pass to the adjacent <HI>Con∣tinent,</HI> Where a careful Enquiry has been lately made, in a <HI>Visitation</HI> ordered for that purpose by the Com∣missioners for such affairs. The Result of the En∣quiry was, That there are between Twenty &amp; Thirty Congregations of <HI>Christianized Indians,</HI> here on the <HI>Main;</HI> whereto there belong near Three Thousand Souls. Here are Ten English Preachers, who give them their Instructions and Assistences, and Preach un∣to them, either on the <HI>Lords dayes,</HI> or in appointed
<PB N="196" REF="001460_0197_0FB34C5CE9A73928"/>
<HI>Lectures.</HI> There are also between Twenty &amp; Thirty <HI>Indian</HI> Teachers, by whom the Exercises of the <HI>Lords-dayes</HI> are mostly managed. They have in several of these Villages on the <HI>Main,</HI> also made handsome Sub∣scriptions of their own, towards the Building of <HI>Meet∣ing-Houses;</HI> wherein the English likewise have helped them. They have the whole <HI>Bible</HI> in their own Lan∣guage; which has been here twice Printed for them. This <HI>Great Light</HI> has been <HI>Satellited,</HI> with other Books which we have also printed for them, in their own Language. Their Library is continually growing, by <HI>New Books,</HI> wherewith we Serve and Suit the Interests of Christianity among them, from time to time, as we see occasion. And their <HI>Schools</HI> are multiplying. <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> also is frequently upheld among them. And their <HI>Marriages</HI> are usually celebrated according to the Directions left by the famous ELIOT, whose Name still is of much Authority with them.</P>
<P>There are some Congregations of <HI>Indians,</HI> which are not advanced unto all the Priviledges of the <HI>Evan∣gelical Church-State;</HI> not yet combining for, and En∣joying of, all <HI>Special Ordinances.</HI> Yet a considerable Number of them are so; and some <HI>New Churches</HI> have been lately form'd and fill'd among them.</P>
<P>The performances in the ordinary Congregations of the <HI>Indians,</HI> have been often such, that there are very many English Witnesses, who have not a little admired at the Gravity, the Attention, the Affection expressed in them. The pertinent <HI>Prayers</HI> (and, <HI>Sine Monitore, quia de Pectore,</HI>) the Orthodox <HI>Sermons,</HI> (at the Hear∣ing whereof, the very Children of a dozen years old will readily turn to the Proofs,) and the Singing of <HI>Psalms,</HI> with a Melody out-doing many of the English, in their Meetings, have been frequently observed with Admiration. To see such forlorn Salvages, and the most ruteful Ruines of Mankind, not only <HI>Cicurated</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="001460_0198_0FB34C5F48D29738"/>
into some Civility, but also <HI>Elevated</HI> unto so much Knowledge and Practice of <HI>Christianity,</HI> has to some appeared an amiable and admirable Spectacle!</P>
<P>In their Churches, they have <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Elders</HI> of their own; <HI>Ordained,</HI> Sometimes by the Hands of <HI>English</HI> Ministers; and sometimes by the Hands of the <HI>Indian</HI> Ministers, in the Presence of the English; All after the Solemn English manner. And by <HI>Ad∣monitions</HI> and <HI>Excommunications</HI> Publickly dispensed, they proceed against Scandalous Offendors: for which Intent, and that they may seasonably Find and Heal all <HI>Scandals,</HI> they hold a <HI>Church-Meeting</HI> the Week be∣fore every Communion.</P>
<P>One that is at this Time, a Pious and Faithful Eng∣lish Minister, but Preaching also to the <HI>Indians,</HI> has given in unto us, this Testimony.</P>
<P><Q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Worship, with the affectionate Confessions of such as are Admitted, into the Church, make me hope, that many of them may have the Work of the Spirit wrought in them, <HI>according to the working of the mighty Power of God.</HI> Their Method, respecting those that are Admit∣ted into their Communion, is more according to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practised among the Chur∣ches in most Parts. The Person to be Admit∣ted, stands forth in the midst of the Assembly; and first makes a <HI>Declaration</HI> of his <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and sometimes desires <HI>Information</HI> in things more ar∣duous and doubtful. And then, he makes a <HI>Confession of Sin;</HI> which they do, (as I have seen) with <HI>Tears</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> like him in the
<PB N="198" REF="001460_0199_0FB34A2889E6D210"/>
<HI>Sixteenth</HI> Chapter of the <HI>Acts.</HI> And then he gives an Account of <HI>Experiences</HI> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings, and Comforts; in which they are large and particular. After which (much Counsel and Exhortation, to re∣main stedfast in the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Wayes</HI> of the Lord, being given them, by their <HI>Pastor</HI> and <HI>Elder</HI>) they are Admitted. I would, (and not un∣groundedly) hope, That <HI>Additions</HI> are <HI>made unto the Church daily of such as shall be Saved.</HI> There are many, which maintain a Christian Conversation, and are to be accounted, not <HI>Almost,</HI> but <HI>Altogether Christians.</HI> And this does Encourage the Preaching of the Gospel to them; when we see, it pleases God to make it, <HI>His Power unto Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At present, we can do nothing for those Bloody Salvages in the <HI>Eastern Parts,</HI> who have been taught by the <HI>French Priests,</HI> That the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was a <HI>French</HI> Lady, and that our Great Saviour was a <HI>French∣man,</HI> and that the <HI>English</HI> Murdered Him, and that He Rose from the Dead, &amp; is taken up to the Heavens, but that all that would recommend themselves to His Fa∣vour, must Revenge His Quarrel on the English Peo∣ple; which issuing out from their Indiscoverable Swamps, they have often done with cruel Depredati∣ons. When we have had the short Respites of a Truce with them, we have made several New At∣tempts to carry them the Tenders of a <HI>Glorious Gospel;</HI> but they have presently broke out into Fresh Hostilities, which have put an End unto all Good Expectations concerning them.</P>
<P>There has been <HI>Something done</HI> to <HI>Christianize</HI> the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> and other Indians, in the Colony of <HI>Con∣necticut;</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="001460_0200_0FB34A2526CE6ED8"/>
but, <HI>Lord, who has believed!</HI> They have been obstinate in their Paganism; however their obstinacy has not put an End unto our Endeavours.</P>
<P>An Exemplary Indian Minister, whose Name is <HI>Japhet,</HI> has of late years made several Salleyes, among his Pagan Country-men, about the <HI>Narraganset</HI>-Coun∣trey; and the <HI>Hand of the Lord has been with him,</HI> and many <HI>have Believed, and turned unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>We have made many Trials, to make the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of the Gospel, reach unto the Five Nations, that are some Hundreds of Miles distant from us, to the Westward. All that is yet accomplished, is, To Sup∣port and Reward the pains of several <HI>Dutch</HI> Ministers, who proceed as far as they well can, that these may no longer be such <HI>Foolish Nations;</HI> and have seen some comfortable Successes of their Ministry.</P>
<P>The Principal concern for the Indians in the <HI>Massa∣chuset</HI>-Province, is to Preserve and Improve the <HI>Christi∣anity</HI> already Professed among them, and Prevent the loss of a <HI>Noble Work</HI> by some Degeneracies, which have no very well boding Aspect upon it: Especially, to Prevent the Fatal Effects, with which the <HI>Bottel</HI> threatens it. In order hereto, various Methods are used continually, to keep a Watchful Inspection on their Manners, and to make what Progress we can in <HI>Anglicising</HI> of them. These things are in the <HI>Practice</HI> Encumbred with Difficulties, beyond what can be by most men in the bare <HI>Theory</HI> imagined. But the <HI>Com∣missioners</HI> here Entrusted, for the management of that Affayr, continually Consult and Pursue, what may be most Subservient unto the Grand Intention.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a Passage of the Incomparable BOYL; <Q>When I consider, how much more to the Advantage of the Sacred Writings, and of Christian Theology in general, diverse Texts have been Explain'd and Discours'd of, by the Excellent <HI>Grotius, Masius, Mede,</HI> and Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> and some other Late Great Wits, (to name now no Living ones,) in their several kinds, than the same Places have been hand∣led by Vulgar Expositors, and other Divines; And when I consider, that none of these Wor∣thies was at once a great Philosopher and a Great Critick; I cannot but hope, that when it shall please God, to stir up Persons of a Phi∣losophical Genius, well furnished with Criti∣cal Learning, and the Principles of true Phi∣losophy, and shall give them an Hearty con∣cern for the Advance of His Truths, these men will make Explications, &amp; Discoveries that shall be admirable. — You should no more measure the Wisdom of God couched in the Bible, by the Glosses and Systems of Common Expositors and Preachers, than Estimate the Wisdom He has Express'd in the contrivance of the World, by <HI>Magirus</HI>'s or <HI>Eustachius</HI>'s Physicks.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="001460_0202_0FB34A299F2ADDD8"/>Many years after this, the admirable <HI>Witsius</HI> comforts us with a Passage of an observable Aspect that way; <Q><HI>Neque profecto officio hic suo defuerunt Illustres Animae.</HI>—There have not bees wanting those Illustrious Men, who have observed all the Solid Discoveries in <HI>Philosophy,</HI> all the curi∣ous Researches of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> or that has occured in <HI>Physick</HI> or in <HI>Law,</HI> relating to the <HI>Sacred Scriptures,</HI> and have applyed it all with a Signal Dexterity to the <HI>Illustration</HI> thereof; And so 'tis come to pass, that <HI>Theology,</HI> which had vast Riches of its own before, is now also Enriched with foreign <HI>Spoiles,</HI> and appears with those Ornaments, which Extort, even from them that are most of all disaffected unto it, a confession of its most charming Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>The Noble Service to Mankind, thus pro∣pounded, having been so far Pursued, it is easy to imagine, that a Person of but common Abi∣lities, applying himself unto it, might accomplish a very <HI>Rich Collection of Illustrations,</HI> upon the glo∣rious <HI>Book of Truth and of Life.</HI> It may not be a∣miss, but the Treatise now in our Hands may very agreeably do it, that the Friends of Learn∣ing and Religion be now <HI>Advertised,</HI> of a Moderate Performance, which by the Help of Heaven, has been produced, of such a Tendency.</P>
<P>No little part of what has been Written on the Great Intention of <HI>Illustrating the Divine Oracles,</HI> has been perused. Some Hundreds of the <HI>Latest,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Oldest</HI> Writers, that have had any

thing Looking that way, have been consulted. Many Thousands of their <HI>Finest Thoughts</HI> have been found out, Extracted, &amp; Digested. The <HI>Eye</HI> of the Authors Industry, has not yet <HI>Seen every Precious Thing;</HI> yet it has often, in the three Lustres of years, which have ran since he began his Undertaking, <HI>Visited the Place of Sapphires,</HI> and <HI>found the Dust of Gold,</HI> which is here Exposed un∣to the Refined part of Mankind, when it shall see cause to accept thereof. And there are Two Competent Volumns of the choicest <HI>Illustra∣tions,</HI> (in <HI>folio</HI>) now lying ready for Publi∣cation.</P>
<P>The Work interferes not at all, with the Two very valuable Volumns of the POLAN <HI>Annota∣tions;</HI> but may ask for it, as an agreeable Ho∣nour, to attend upon them.</P>

<P>To bestow the censure of <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Vanity,</HI> on the Proposing of such a Work for Publication, would be there-with to Reproach all Attempts in such a way to Serve the Publick. 'Tis no Trespass against the Rules of <HI>Modesty,</HI> (but it would look like one against the Rules of <HI>Equity</HI> to call it so,) to give the Publick, a Report, and a Tender, of what has been thus Prepared. It

is a <HI>Lawful</HI> and a <HI>Modest</HI> thing, for a Man to Desire, that so much of a Short Life, as has been Spent in such a Preparation, should not be <HI>Spent in vain.</HI></P>
<P>The Author Lives in Daily Expectation of his Death; But he Dies with some Hope, that the Glorious Head of the Church, will stir up some generous Minds, to forward an Undertaking So Confessedly Worthy to be Prosecuted.</P>
