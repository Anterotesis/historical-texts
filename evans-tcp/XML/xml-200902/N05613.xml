<HEAD><HI>To the</HI> TRUSTEES <HI>of the</HI> PHILADELPHIA <HI>ACADEMY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING receiv'd the utmost Satisfac∣tion in visiting your Academy, and exa∣mining some of its higher Classes, I cou'd not be easy 'till I had testify'd that Satisfaction in the most public Manner. The undeserv'd No∣tice many of you were pleas'd to take of Me during my short Stay in your City, and the Ho∣nor the Academy (when I first went into it) did me, in making one of the Youth speak a Copy of Verses, which I lately wrote to promote the Interest of <HI>Science</HI> in a neighbouring Province, might claim my most grateful Acknowleg∣ments.—But what I now offer is a Tribute paid to Merit of a more public Nature. A few pri∣vate Gentlemen of this City have, in the Space of two or three Years, projected, begun, and carried to surprizing Perfection, a very noble <HI>In∣stitution;</HI> and an Institution of that Kind too, which, in other Countries, has scarce made such a Figure in the Space of some Centuries, tho' founded by Kings, and supported at the public Expence.</P>
<P>Prosecute, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> yet a little longer pro∣secute your <HI>generous Plan,</HI> with the same Spirit; and your own Reputation, with that of your
<PB N="iv" REF="007122_0003_102AFA03D568E178"/><HI>Academy,</HI> shall be establish'd, in Spite of every Obstacle, on a Bottom immortal, and never to be shaken. A Succession of <HI>good Men</HI> and <HI>good Ci∣tizens</HI> shall never be wanting in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to do Honor to your Memories, and diffuse Spirit and Happiness thro' their Country.—The Vir∣tues to be chiefly inculcated on your Youth in order to obtain this End, you know better than I. They are however modestly hinted, in the fol∣lowing Poem, from a Mouth that cannot fail to give them new Importance:</P>
<P>The Performance is far inferior to the Subject; but an Apology will not mend it. As I can have no Time to improve it during my Stay in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> I beg your Acceptance of it, as it is at pre∣sent; together with my Promise of rendering it more worthy the Subject, when more Leisure shall enable me so to do.—</P>
<P>That the Success of your Undertaking may still exceed even your own most sanguine Hopes, is my earnest Prayer; as it is my firm Persuasion that such a fair Beginning cannot fail of the most lasting good Consequences.</P>

<L>Dear
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Author's Pupils, the three eldest Sons of the Honorable <HI>Josiah Mar∣tin,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late of <HI>Antigua:</HI> They were plac'd at the Academy of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> at the Time this Piece was written.</NOTE> Pupils, let the Lessons here imprest,</L>
<L>Sink intimate and deep into your Breast.</L>
<L>Now climb the Steep to <HI>Science</HI> in your <HI>Youth,</HI></L>
<L N="250">The <HI>Votaries</HI> of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and of <HI>Truth.</HI></L>
<L>Your Zeal let none within these Walls excel;</L>
<L>Strive for <HI>Esteem,</HI> for <HI>Glory,</HI> and—farewell!</L>

<L>When some few Years have roll'd their Toils away,</L>
<L>And Youth gives Place to Life's meridian Day;</L>

Not Mother more shall joy in her first Birth,</L>
<L>Than I, if, blest with all your <HI>Father</HI>'s Worth,</L>
<L>You rise, in dangerous Times, your Country's Soul,</L>
<L>Or fam'd for <HI>Courage,</HI> or for temper'd <HI>Rule.</HI></L>
<L>Or if like Him, warn'd by declining Years,</L>
<L N="260">You wisely quit the Scene of public Cares;</L>
<L>And seek a calmer Bliss in private Shade,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Nature</HI>'s various Changes are display'd;</L>
<L>Tracing new Wonders of <HI>creative Power</HI></L>
<L>With ravish'd Heart, improv'd from Hour to Hour;</L>
<L N="265">Known to a <HI>few,</HI> but by that <HI>few</HI> belov'd;</L>
<L>Happy at Home; within yourselves approv'd;</L>
<L>Your well-taught <HI>Offspring</HI> rising glad around;</L>
<L>With all your <HI>Virtues,</HI> all your <HI>Graces</HI> crown'd,</L>
<L>To fill your Place, when, call'd to heavenly Day,</L>
<L N="270">Calm as you liv'd, you die—and tower away.</L>
