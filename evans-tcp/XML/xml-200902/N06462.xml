<L N="10">In the dread Interval of eight Days Siege:</L>

<L>Amazing Perfidy! —</L>
<L>— Not to invoke</L>
<L>A vulgar Muse. — Ye Powers of Fury lend</L>
<L N="20">Some mighty Phrensy to enrage my Breast</L>
<L>With solemn Song, beyond all Nature's Strain!</L>
<L>For such the Scene of which I mean to sing.</L>
<L>Enough! I rave! —the Furies rack my Brain!</L>
<L>I feel their Influence now inspire my Song!</L>
<L N="25">My lab'ring Muse swells with the raving God!</L>
<L>I feel him here! my Head turns round! 'twill burst!</L>
<L>So have I seen a Bomb, with livid Train,</L>
<L>(Emitted from a Mortar) big with Death,</L>
<L>And fraught, full fraught with Hell's Combustibles,</L>
<L N="30">Lay dreadful on the Ground; then with a Force</L>
<L>Stupendous, shiver in a thousand Atoms!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But on, my Muse. —</L>
<L>— Scarce had the Dawn appear'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Phoebus</HI> rose from <HI>Thetis'</HI> Lap in Blood,</L>
<L N="35">Portending dreadful Scenes and Wide of Death,</L>
<L>When now the War-worn Troops, in close Array,</L>
<L>With list'ning Ear impatient wait the Sound,</L>
<L>Graceful to march (pursuant to the Terms</L>
<L>Capitulated with the Victor <HI>Gaul</HI>)</L>
<L N="40"><PB N="9" REF="008194_0006_102E4A5B0CBF61C8"/>
With streaming Ensigns waving in the Air,</L>
<L>And sounding Drums; with Arms and Baggage fraught,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A brazen Engine big with threat'ning Death,</L>
<L>And lighted Match, to awe the Savage Foe;</L>
<L>With large Escorts of (faithless) Troops to guard</L>
<L N="45">Our destin'd Way to <HI>Edward</HI>'s happier Plains;</L>
<L>While we with <HI>Gaul</HI> nor more <HI>offensive</HI> War,</L>

<L>'Till <HI>six revolving Seasons</HI> have expir'd.</L>
<L>But, Oh! Reverse of Scenes, and Morn of Woe!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="50">For now behold Hell's swarthy Allies dire,</L>
<L>With Visage foul, and horrid awful Grin;</L>
<L>Red, black, and green besmear'd their mighty Fronts;</L>
<L>With snaky Braids, and dreadful Ornament,</L>
<L>And pitchy Feathers platted on their Hair;</L>
<L N="55">Obscene and naked, daub'd with various Paints,</L>
<L>With Aspect dire, and fell <HI>Canadian</HI> Rage,</L>
<L>And murd'rous Shafts (Presage of awful Death!)</L>
<L>Like Fiends of Hell, or worse (if possible)</L>
<L>With fearful Yell, to raise the Hell below,</L>
<L N="60">To th' Assistance of the Hell within 'em,</L>
<L>Rush on their unforewarn'd defenceless Prey.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="008194_0007_102E4A5DC7D50910"/>
<L>And now the Scene of Death begins, for, Oh!</L>
<L>Amaz'd on every Side th' unwary Troops</L>
<L>Fall hapless Victims to the Savage Furies.</L>
<L>Hark! hark! what lamentable, Soul-fetch'd Sighs</L>
<L N="66">Of dying Soldiers now invade my Ears.</L>
<L>See yonder Savage with his bloody Shaft,</L>
<L>Just reeking from the Heart of one more bold,</L>
<L>Who dar'd oppose the dread impending Stroke</L>
<L N="70">Lift up to strike the suppliant Soul! who begs,</L>
<L>On bended Knee, to spare his wretched Life;</L>
<L>But only stoop'd to take the fatal Blow!</L>
<L>O Scene of Horror, black tremendous Day,</L>
<L>Ill-fated Hour! But, hark! again what Cries?</L>
<L>The Mother's Shrieks, and Father's manlier Grief,</L>
<L>And Childrens Screams, and Soldiers dying Groans,</L>
<L N="77">Now pierce my Soul. But turn about and see,</L>
<L>O Sight of Woe! what Floods of streaming Gore</L>
<L>And vital Carnage spread the ample Field!</L>
<L N="80">See! welt'ring on the sandy Shore, the Babe,</L>
<L>The harmless Babe (torn from its Mother's Arms</L>
<L>And dash'd, impetuous, on the Wave-worn Cliff!)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Numbers fail me! Oh! it is too much!</L>
<L>But up, my Soul, and take another View.</L>
<L N="85"><PB N="11" REF="008194_0008_102E4A5F4CEB4BF8"/>
See, discompos'd, the naked flying Troops</L>
<L>Asylum seek in Woods and miry Swamps;</L>
<L>On bended Knees implore the <HI>Gallic</HI> Aid;</L>
<L>Remind 'em of their Honour; — but in vain.</L>
<L>The dread Pursuit begins; — Now louder Shouts</L>
<L>And hideous Screechings fill the neighb'ring Wild,</L>
<L N="91">Which echo back the Sound with fearful Horror!</L>
<L>The hindmost now a Victim fall, while some</L>
<L>More nimble, make Asylum of the Fort;</L>
<L>While others, captiv'd by Satanic Fiends,</L>
<L N="95">Reserv'd for Pastime of their midnight Revels.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus, in awful Dread, I gaz'd around,</L>
<L>Three brawny Savages, as huge as fell,</L>
<L>(<HI>Titanian</HI> Sons, that warr'd on <HI>Jove</HI> of Yore)</L>
<L>With thrice three Yells, seiz'd me a hapless Captive.</L>
<L>Thence hurry'd on thrô Vallies, Swamps, and o'er</L>
<L N="101">Stupendous Precipices; then through Woods,</L>
<L>O'er Cliffs and craggy Steeps, 'till now at length</L>
<L>A dreary Waste presented to my View</L>
<L>The sad Destruction of a thousand Years;</L>
<L N="105">Here sable Pines promiscuous lay along,</L>
<L>And thorny Brakes and miry Bogs, the Haunt</L>
<L>Of hissing Serpents, and envenom'd Toads;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="008194_0009_102E4A61E66043B8"/>
It seem'd the solemn Exile of the damn'd:</L>
<L>Hither, with awful Pace, they me conduct</L>
<L N="110">And, with terrific Menace, sat me down</L>
<L>(But mutter'd first some hellish Charm) then with</L>
<L>Extended brawny Arm, and winged Shaft,</L>
<L>They thrice essay'd to fell me to the Ground;</L>
<L>And thrice the over-ruling God withheld!</L>
<L N="115">For now relenting, Oh! stupendous Change!</L>
<L>One Mind had sway'd the three, with one Consent</L>
<L>To spare my truly wretched Life; but yet</L>
<L>Nor suppliant Tone, nor Cry for Mercy had</L>
<L>Escap'd my Tongue; for Mercy who'd expect</L>
<L N="120">From <HI>Cannibals</HI> that gorge on Human Flesh,</L>
<L>And swill, like <HI>Polypheme,</HI> the reeking Gore?</L>
<L>Proceed my Muse; how they with grumb'ling Tone</L>
<L>And antic Sign and Gesture bid me rise:</L>
<L>I quick obey'd, and rose as from the Dead,</L>
<L N="125">(For Death inevitable seem'd my Lot)</L>
<L>And now with rapid Pace again I move,</L>
<L>But yet with lighter Heart, for heav'nly Gleam</L>
<L>Of Hopes of Liberty inspir'd my Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now had we near twelve Furlongs run, when lo!</L>
<L N="130">O Life to Death! behold again the Lake,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="008194_0010_102E4A66AD5024B8"/>
Ill-fated Waters, — but to me auspicious;</L>
<L>Thither we bent our Course and reach'd the Shore.</L>
<L>Sight unexpected! — fifty Captives there,</L>
<L>Besmear'd with Paint of sable, red, and green,</L>
<L N="135">With Looks uncouth, in Savage Order sat</L>
<L>By twenty Barks, which lay upon the Sand.</L>
<L>While thus I wond'ring stood, a fearful Screach</L>
<L>Hoarse thunder'd horrid thrô the Ruffian Croud,</L>
<L>Which scarce had echo'd from the neighb'ring Wild,</L>
<L N="140">When all the fierce Banditti Force I saw</L>
<L>In close Employ, to launch their ample Boats;</L>
<L>This done, we all embark, and push from Land,</L>
<L>And skim the liquid Surface of the Lake,</L>
<L>'Till low'ring Night concludes the dreadful Day;</L>
<L N="145">But ushers on a Scene of ten-fold Fear!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For now to Land explore the dusky Way,</L>
<L>And, with Herculean Labour, strait begin</L>
<L>(With sweaty Brow) to fell the sturdy Oak,</L>
<L>Which, Pile on Pile, compos'd a spacious Heap.</L>
<L N="150">Then, from the solid Steel and Flint condense,</L>
<L>Extract the dormant Sparks of hidden Fire,</L>
<L>And set the Whole into a mighty Blaze:</L>
<L>And now the curling Flames ascend in Spires,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="008194_0011_102E4A6998CF8830"/>
And Pyramids of Smoke obscure the Stars,</L>
<L N="155">Assault the Skies, and mingle with the Clouds.</L>
<L>Then with distorted Grin and Visage fierce,</L>
<L>And solemn Howl, they move us to the Pile,</L>
<L>Nor less it seem'd than antient Funeral Fire:</L>
<L>But, Oh! in every Face what wild Amaze</L>
<L N="160">Conspicuous appear'd! and Dread of Death!</L>
<L>Not all that Bards in antient Fables tell</L>
<L>Of <HI>Dis</HI>'s Realm and subteraneous Vaults;</L>
<L>Sulphureous Caverns (Streaks of livid Fire)</L>
<L>Where suffocating Stench assault the damn'd;</L>
<L N="165">And ghastly Spectres glaring to the View,</L>
<L>Speak ten-fold Horror and amazing Dread;</L>
<L>Where Hell's grim Porter, with his triple Front,</L>
<L>A fell <HI>Chimera</HI> vomits purple Flame,</L>
<L>And damned <HI>Hydra</HI> with his seven Heads;</L>
<L N="170">Can seem to parallel this baleful Scene</L>
<L>Of Dread, Astonishment, and wild Disorder!</L>
<L>But yet (stupendous Love of God to Man!)</L>
<L>Nor Blood was spilt, nor perish'd yet a Hair!</L>
<L N="174">For barb'rous Music struck to antic Dance,</L>
<L>And hoarse Powaws conclude the dreadful Night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seven Days and Nights of Horror thus pass'd o'er</L>
<L>Our Heads; when lo! O Soul-reviving Sight!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="008194_0012_102E4A6C30D1D168"/>
The eighth, as we pursue our wonted Course,</L>
<L>See all <HI>Montreal</HI> open to our View;</L>
<L>Where sovereign Liquor bought our Liberty;</L>
<L N="181">But yet not all, for still in Savage Bands,</L>
<L>An hundred hapless Captives now remain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor must omit how, on <HI>Montreal</HI> Plains,</L>
<L N="185">Th' inhuman Banditti (in drunken Mood)</L>
<L>Ript up the Bowels of a Prisoner;</L>
<L>Then, with extended Jaw, the beating Heart</L>
<L>(Yet warm with parting Life) varacious swallow'd!</L>
<L>And swill'd the Blood, and revell'd on the Carcase!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Chief in War! of all (young) <HI>Albion</HI>'s Force,</L>
<L N="191">Invest me only with SUFFICIENT Power;</L>
<L>I (yet a Boy) will play the Man, and chase</L>
<L>The wily Savage from his secret Haunts;</L>
<L>Not Alpine Mounts shall thwart my rapid Course;</L>
<L>I'll scale the Craggs, then, with impetuous Speed,</L>
<L>Rush down the Steep, and scow'r along the Vale;</L>
<L>Then on the Sea-Shore halt; and last, explore</L>
<L N="198">The green Meanders of eternal Wood!</L>
