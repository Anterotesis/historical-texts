<P>THE Text I now Read, had not been Readd unto you, if the Providence of God had not furnished me with an <HI>Ex∣traordinary Commentary</HI> upon it. Yester∣day there took her Flight from us, an Excellent Handmaid of the Lord, in whose <HI>Dispositions</HI> and <HI>Circumstances,</HI> my Text had a most Emphatical, and Ob∣servable <HI>Commentary.</HI> And I shall do but what is required in the <HI>Fifth Command∣ment,</HI> if I take this Opportunity of do∣ing
<PB N="4" REF="001624_0003_0FB3E35A2574F570"/>a Justice to the <HI>Memory</HI> of a <HI>Just One,</HI> whom we all agree to Honour as a <HI>Mother Israel:</HI> And for whom we are this Day, <HI>Bow'd down heavily, as One that Mourneth for his Mother.</HI> A Person, who was One of the <HI>First-born,</HI> if not the <HI>very First</HI> of her Sex that was Born, in this famous <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the <HI>English-America:</HI> And who deserves to be Ho∣nourably Mentioned, as long as <HI>BOS∣TON</HI> shall endure, which, I hope, will be unto the second Coming of our Sa∣viour. May it be an happy Omen, that <HI>Many Daughters</HI> of this our <HI>New-English Jerusalem</HI> will <HI>do Virtuously,</HI> when we see the <HI>First</HI> of them, like another <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>am,</HI> (her Names-sake) leading them in the Praises of God.</P>
<P>I will not lose the Sight of <HI>Her,</HI> tho' I will for an Hour seem to address no∣thing but the Text, that I have chosen on her Occasion: A Text, wherein I see both the <HI>Blessings of the Upper-Springs,</HI> and the <HI>Blessings of the Nether-Spring,</HI> flowing unto us. Our God has this in His Order for our Meeting this Day; <HI>Gather the People together, and I will give them Water.</HI> O Congregation, Sing here∣upon
<PB N="5" REF="001624_0004_0FB3E35BB07C0878"/>the Song of <HI>Israel; Spring up, O Well; Sing ye unto it!</HI></P>
<P>I verily believe, that Blessings to be received in <HI>another World,</HI> are here en∣gaged unto the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> But, I find, Interpreters do generally understand certain Blessings to be received in <HI>this World.</HI> And I know, That <HI>Godliness</HI> has <HI>the Promise of the Life that now is,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Life that is to come.</HI> I am wil∣ling so far to comply with the <HI>Voice of the Board</HI> of Interpreters, as to employ first a Discourse on certain Blessings, which Piety will obtain for us, in the <HI>Life that now is.</HI> But I foresee, that be∣fore I have done, the Blessings which Piety will obtain for us in the <HI>Life that is to come,</HI> will break in upon our Me∣ditations. We shall be unavoidably, and as it were by Surprize, led into the Me∣ditations of them.</P>
<P>You may behold here, a <HI>Conjunction</HI> of Blessings: An <HI>Aspect</HI> full of Happiness. One is, An <HI>Easy Soul.</HI> The other is, An <HI>Happy Seed.</HI> Indeed there is a very great <HI>Adaptation</HI> in the mention of these toge∣ther. They are very <HI>Aptly</HI> joined. Our departing <HI>Soul</HI> does not fall into <HI>Uneasi∣ness</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001624_0005_0FB3E35D2F001AC0"/>on any Point more sensibly, than the Condition of our <HI>Seed.</HI> That which makes us very <HI>Uneasy,</HI> is, our Thoughts, <HI>What may become of our Children.</HI> O God∣fearing Man, <HI>Fear nothing;</HI> let thy <HI>Soul dwell at Ease;</HI> thy <HI>Offspring</HI> shall be well provided for.</P>
<P>This is the DOCTRINE that is now ready for you.</P>
<P><HI>To Live in the true Fear of God, is the way to Lodge in a sweet Ease of Soul: And they that fear God have this good Thing particularly to make them Easy, that their Children after them shall fare the better for them.</HI></P>
<P>¶ We will begin with the Advan∣age which our Piety will bring to <HI>Our selves:</HI> The Advantage of, <HI>An easy Soul The Fear of the Lord will be the Ease of the Soul that has it.</HI> Piety will rescue the Soul from <HI>Disturbance,</HI> from <HI>Vexation,</HI> from such Troubles and such Tumults, as will else Discompose it wonderfully.</P>
<P>We will first of all take Notice of some <HI>General Instructions,</HI> about the <HI>Ease
<PB N="7" REF="001624_0006_0FB3E35EB2391228"/>of Soul</HI> which Piety will be attended withal. If Ministers would accurately consult the Languages wherein our God has written His Oracles unto us, they would often find such <HI>Hints,</HI> as would otherwise pass unobserved, tho' most highly worthy of Observation. Here is an Instance. There is an Instructive Elegance and Emphasis, yea, a Variety of Instructions, in that Expression, <HI>His Soul shall dwell at Ease.</HI></P>
<P>First. The <HI>Ease</HI> of Mind obtained by Piety, will be a <HI>Lasting Ease.</HI> Our Soul will <HI>Dwell</HI> in it. Our <HI>Abode</HI> will be in <HI>Ease.</HI> We shall have an <HI>Abiding Ease.</HI> There will be a <HI>Continuance</HI> of our <HI>Ease.</HI> We enter into it, at our <HI>First Conversion</HI> unto Piety; we shall remain in it, unto all <HI>Eternity.</HI> It won't be the short Blaze of <HI>Thorns Crackling under a Pot.</HI> When, I pray, when will it come to an End? Not until the <HI>Soul</HI> it self come to an End: A Lamp of God, that shall Burn forever. The Account is a <HI>Joyful</HI> One, a <HI>Pleasant</HI> One: Psal. XVI. 11. <HI>Fulness of Joy, and Pleasures forevermore.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Ease</HI> of Mind attain'd by Piety, is to be enjoy'd in the <HI>Dark∣est
<PB N="8" REF="001624_0007_0FB3E36037877FF8"/>Time</HI> that passes over us. Our Soul shall <HI>spend the Night</HI> in it. This is the <HI>English</HI> of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word used here. When 'tis with us, a <HI>Night</HI> of Darkness and Sorrow, even <HI>then</HI> we shall be <HI>at Ease.</HI> There shall arise unto us <HI>Light in Darkness.</HI> We shall meet with such Things as will give us <HI>Ease,</HI> and <HI>Revive us, when we Walk in the midst of Trouble.</HI> When 'tis a very <HI>Dark Time</HI> with us, and a <HI>Midnight</HI> of Confusion is on our Af∣fairs, and our Flesh can <HI>See nothing</HI> but Hazard and Horror on every side, <HI>Now</HI> is the Time that Piety will give <HI>Ease</HI> unto us. It will do that Thing; Job XXXV. 10. <HI>Give Songs in the Night.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Soul</HI> is the <HI>Seat</HI> of that <HI>Ease</HI> which is attain'd by Piety. Our <HI>Body</HI> may be <HI>ill at Ease,</HI> notwithstanding our Piety. A Pious Man may have a <HI>Diseased Body;</HI> a <HI>Body,</HI> that shall be as they said the Laborious <HI>Calvin's</HI> was, <HI>An Hospital of Diseases;</HI> a <HI>Body</HI> that shall <HI>Feel,</HI> as <HI>Timothies</HI> did, <HI>Often Infirmities. Lord, One whom thou Lovest, is Sick!</HI> But the <HI>Soul</HI> may be <HI>at Ease,</HI> when the <HI>Body</HI> is in Pain. When the <HI>Outward Man</HI> is even broken to Pieces, Piety will enable us to
<PB N="9" REF="001624_0008_0FB3E361B3776E28"/>say still, <HI>My Mind is Easy!</HI> Our <HI>Soul</HI> shall be <HI>Sedate,</HI> yea, <HI>Solac'd,</HI> when our <HI>Out∣ward Man</HI> is never so much off the Hinges. If Piety would only Ease the <HI>Body,</HI> we should call it, <HI>A Physician of no Value.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Soul,</HI> the <HI>Soul,</HI> that most wants to be made <HI>Easy. Easiness</HI> in the <HI>Outward Man</HI> indeed cannot be expected here: This is a World that has <HI>Thorns</HI> every where growing in it. But now, the Boast of Piety is that; <HI>Luk.</HI> I. 46, 47. <HI>My Soul does Magnify the Lord; my Spirit has Rejoiced in God my Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>We will now go on in the next Place, to <HI>Enquire</HI> more Particularly. What is that <HI>Ease</HI> which Piety brings to the <HI>Soul?</HI> And, Whence that <HI>Ease</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI> arises? Diverse MAXIMS of PIETY are to be taken into our Consideration, and for our Encouragement in the course of Piety. By these MAXIMS, the <HI>Enquiry</HI> will be sufficiently answered.</P>
<P N="1">I. Piety brings us to <HI>Dwell</HI> in a <HI>Good State:</HI> And, Oh! the Glorious <HI>Ease</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Soul</HI> of that Man, who finds himself to be fixed in a <HI>Good State</HI> for Perpetuity! What we render, <HI>His Soul shall Dwell at Ease,</HI> is in the
<PB N="10" REF="001624_0009_0FB3E36337D28318"/>Original, <HI>His Soul shall dwell in Good.</HI> It is an <HI>Ease</HI> flowing from a Sense of <HI>Good.</HI> A <HI>Good State</HI> makes the Mind <HI>Easy.</HI> By the <HI>Fear of God</HI> we are brought into a <HI>Good State.</HI> And that our Mind may <HI>Dwell at Ease,</HI> the <HI>Fear of</HI> God will bring us to <HI>Dwell in a Good State.</HI> We shall be fixed in it. The <HI>New Covenant</HI> is a <HI>Good</HI> Covenant. It is called, <HI>The Bet∣ter Covenant.</HI> Piety settles us under the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> A Soul <HI>settled</HI> under the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> may Sing that Song; Psal. CXVI. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Return to thy Rest, O my Soul, for the Lord has deals Bountifully with thee.</HI> My Friend, what is there now to <HI>Disquiet</HI> thy Soul? Thou art in a <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> which makes over the Alsuffi∣cient GOD unto thee for thy Portion: Surely a most <HI>sufficient Portion!</HI> A <HI>Cove∣nant</HI> that puts thee into the Hands of a most Powerful and Merciful <HI>Saviour:</HI> And none can <HI>Pluck thee out of those Hands!</HI> A <HI>Covenant,</HI> that provides a full Supply of all thy <HI>Wants,</HI> a full Relief of all thy <HI>Fears,</HI> a Defence from all <HI>Damage</HI> in this World, and a Perfection of all <HI>Blessedness</HI> in the World to come. Soul, Do but now sincerely say, <HI>Great GOD,
<PB N="11" REF="001624_0010_0FB3E364AD157D18"/>Be then my God; And Glorious JESUS, let me by thy Merit, and thy Conduct, be brought home unto God!</HI> So from this Mo∣ment, this will be <HI>thy Covenant.</HI> A Soul in such a <HI>Covenant,</HI> may <HI>Dwell at Ease;</HI> and always think, <HI>I am well, I am well; I have all that my Soul can wish for!</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Soul</HI> that <HI>Inherits all Things:</HI> A Soul that has GOD for a <HI>Father:</HI> One whose <HI>Father</HI> is, <HI>The High Possessor of Heaven and Earth:</HI> To be the <HI>Heir</HI> of such a <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Care</HI> of such a <HI>Father; Soul, take thine Ease; thou hast Goods laid up,</HI> not <HI>for ma∣ny Years,</HI> but for Eternal Ages!</P>
<P N="2">II. To <HI>Dwell</HI> in CHRIST and in GOD, is to <HI>Dwell at Ease:</HI> Piety brings us to such a <HI>Dwelling.</HI> It brings to what may be the Version of the Clause we are upon; <HI>His Soul shall dwell with the GOOD ONE.</HI> And who that is, we know very well. By the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we come to <HI>Dwell</HI> in the Glorious ONE, who is <HI>Goodness</HI> it self. The Note of the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is that; <HI>Lord, Toon hast been our Dwel∣ling I lace in all Generations.</HI> Oh! most <HI>Easy Dwelling Flace!</HI> Piety brings us to Dwell in a CHRIST; And so to do, is to <HI>Dwell in a Rock.</HI> The Believer flies
<PB N="12" REF="001624_0011_0FB3E36638334888"/>to a <HI>Christ</HI> as to a <HI>Rock,</HI> and says, <HI>Here will I Dwell, for I have desired it!</HI> Such an one, <HI>Dwells in me, and I in him,</HI> saith our Lord. It may be said unto the Be∣liever, what we Read; Num. XXIV. 21. <HI>Strong is thy Dwelling-Place, and thou put∣test thy Nest in a Rock.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Safety</HI> of such a Dwelling! Oh! how exceeding <HI>Wise</HI> the Soul that makes Choice of such a Dwelling! A <HI>Feeble</HI> Soul, that has made an <HI>House</HI> in such a <HI>Rock,</HI> may well be an <HI>Easy Soul!</HI> O <HI>Soul in Christ;</HI> What, what should hinder thy being a <HI>Soul at Ease?</HI> The Great GOD becomes the <HI>Habitation</HI> of such a Soul. We Read, 1. Joh. III. 24. <HI>He that keeps His Com∣mandments, dwells in Him.</HI> And how ex∣cellently Accommodated must the Soul be, which <HI>Dwells in God!</HI> Certainly, in the Infinite GOD, there is enough to make an <HI>Happy Soul;</HI> and therefore an <HI>Easy Soul.</HI> A Soul in GOD, is a <HI>Well∣sheltered Soul.</HI> He who <HI>Dwells in the secret Place of the most High,</HI> and <HI>abides under the Shadow of the Almighty,</HI> such an one will say of the Lord, <HI>He is my Refuge, my God; in Him I will trust.</HI> The Inten∣tion of all this Metaphor is thus much;
<PB N="13" REF="001624_0012_0FB3E367AEBAD460"/>(for I will uncloath it:) By Piety we <HI>Repair</HI> to God in Christ; We <HI>Secure</HI> His Friendship, His Favour, His ready Suc∣cour; We <HI>Converse</HI> with Him continu∣ally; We are taken under His Prote∣ction. A Soul dwelling <HI>here;</HI> may <HI>Dwell at Ease.</HI> What can there be to Annoy such a Soul?</P>
<P N="3">III. To <HI>Dwell in Peace</HI> is to <HI>Dwell at Ease.</HI> Piety brings us to <HI>Peace:</HI> The <HI>Pathes</HI> thereof are <HI>Pathes of Peace.</HI> To be at <HI>Peace with God,</HI> This, this is to be <HI>Easy;</HI> and hereby, <HI>Good shall come unto thee.</HI> Now, by the <HI>Fear of God</HI> we come into it. We Read; Psal. CXIX. 165. <HI>Great Peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing shall Offend them.</HI> Piety brings us to the <HI>Pardon</HI> of our Sin. The <HI>Guilt of Sin,</HI> is the most heavy <HI>Load</HI> that ever was heard of; A <HI>Load</HI> enough to break the Back of an <HI>Angel!</HI> What would a Soul thoroughly Awakened, and horri∣bly Terrified with the <HI>Guilt of Sin,</HI> give to <HI>be Eased</HI> of such a ponderous <HI>Load?</HI> Piety carries the <HI>Laden Soul</HI> to the <HI>Sacri∣fice</HI> of that Saviour, who says, <HI>Come to me, and I will give thee Rest!</HI> O Soul coming to Piety and Repentance: The
<PB N="14" REF="001624_0013_0FB3E36A295EB6A8"/>Voice of Heaven to thee, is that; Math. IX. 2. <HI>Be of good Cheer, thy Sins are for∣given thee.</HI> 'Tis; <HI>Be at Ease, the Lord has put away thy Sin; Thou shalt not Die.</HI> A Soul Glorifying the Holy God in the ways of Piety, is a Soul <HI>Reconciled</HI> unto GOD. The <HI>Wrath</HI> of GOD is <HI>turned away</HI> from that Soul: That Soul, being <HI>Justified by Faith, has Peace with GOD.</HI> The Song of that <HI>Eased Soul</HI> may be, <HI>I will Praise Thee, O Lord, because tho' thou wast Angry with me, Thine Anger is turned away.</HI> And what follows? <HI>Thou dost Com∣fort me.</HI> A <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Conscience!</HI> A <HI>Soul dwelling at Ease,</HI> is a <HI>Pacified Conscience,</HI> a <HI>Peaceable Conscience;</HI> A <HI>Conscience,</HI> which from the <HI>Blood</HI> of a Saviour sprinkled upon it speaks <HI>Peace</HI> to the pardoned Sinner. In the Wisdom of the Ancients, the Note was, <HI>Haec est Animae Suavissima ut Saluberrima Requies.</HI> A <HI>Conscience</HI> Rag∣ing and Roaring with Guilty Appre∣hensions, is of all things the most Into∣lerable: Such a <HI>Wounded Spirit, who can bear it? who can bear it?</HI> The Soul is <HI>Eased,</HI> when the Painful and Grievous <HI>Wounds</HI> of the <HI>Conscience</HI> are healed. A <HI>Conscience</HI> quieted, by the <HI>Blood of the Son
<PB N="15" REF="001624_0014_0FB3E36B786053C8"/>of God Cleansing from all Sin,</HI> this renders an <HI>Easy</HI> Soul. Piety brings a <HI>Quiet</HI> unto the <HI>Conscience.</HI> It speaks <HI>Peace</HI> to the Soul. Soul, <HI>Dwell at Ease,</HI> when thy <HI>Conscience</HI> has in it, that <HI>Peace of God that passes Un∣derstanding.</HI> A Soul at a <HI>continual Feast,</HI> surely is a Soul <HI>dwelling at Ease.</HI> A <HI>Good Conscience</HI> is a <HI>continual Feast.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Holiness</HI> brings <HI>Ease</HI> to the Soul, by <HI>Healing</HI> the <HI>Distempers</HI> of the Soul. The Fruit of Piety is an <HI>Healed Soul;</HI> therefore an <HI>Easy</HI> one. An <HI>Holy</HI> Soul, is an <HI>Healed Soul.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> is <HI>Health</HI> to the Soul, and <HI>Marrow</HI> to the Mind; It makes an <HI>Healthy</HI> Soul. The <HI>Passions</HI> of the Soul, are the Things which will not let it be <HI>Easy;</HI> Things which break the <HI>Rest</HI> of it. Hence 'tis that we Read; Isa. LVII. 20, 21. <HI>The Wicked are like the troubled Sea, which cannot Rest; There is no Peace, saith my God unto the Wicked.</HI> Piety <HI>Cures</HI> our <HI>Passions;</HI> Moderates them; Regulates them. In Piety the Soul is brought into <HI>Order;</HI> The <HI>Disorders</HI> of the Soul are mightily Rectified. This makes an <HI>Easy Soul.</HI> A <HI>Lust</HI> in the Soul, is a <HI>Thorn</HI> in the Soul. The Soul cannot be at <HI>Ease,</HI> while a <HI>Lust</HI> is Inflaming and
<PB N="16" REF="001624_0015_0FB3E36CF3949318"/>Enraging of it. Piety pulls out the <HI>Thorn.</HI> Our Holy Saviour does in the Piety which He Works in us, <HI>Redeem us from all Iniquity.</HI> Piety will teach the Soul to <HI>Love</HI> nothing in this World <HI>Inordinately,</HI> and makes us willing to <HI>deny our selves</HI> of every thing that God would have us go without. Piety will teach the Soul to lay aside all <HI>Inordinate Care;</HI> It will help us to <HI>cast all our Care upon God,</HI> and put our Trust in Him for the Issue of all. Oh! the <HI>Ease</HI> of the Soul, that can do such things! <HI>Content</HI> makes an <HI>Easy Soul;</HI> yea, it is an <HI>Easy Soul.</HI> A Soul <HI>Dwelling at Ease,</HI> is a Soul <HI>contented</HI> with the Con∣dition which God has appointed for us. Piety brings us to <HI>Contentment.</HI> A Grand Lesson which Piety teaches the Soul, is that; <HI>Be content with such Things as you have.</HI> It brings the Soul to this Easy Frame; <HI>Lord, Not my Will, but thy will be done.</HI> We Read; 1. Tim. VI. 6. <HI>Piety with Contentment is great Gain. Piety</HI> will be with <HI>Contentment;</HI> and therefore it will bring us to <HI>great Ease.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Piety puts the Soul upon that <HI>Course,</HI> which <HI>Usually,</HI> yea, <HI>Naturally</HI> brings <HI>Ease</HI> to the Soul. The <HI>Fear of God</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="001624_0016_0FB3E36E70309BE0"/>will always produce and excite <HI>Prayer</HI> to God. <HI>Every one that is Godly will Pray.</HI> Now <HI>Prayer</HI> is the truest <HI>Hearts-Ease.</HI> When the Soul is not well at <HI>Ease,</HI> the kind Invitation of Heaven unto us, is that; Psal. LV. 22. <HI>Cast thy Burden on the Lord.</HI> Piety will do this thing; and this throws off the <HI>Burden;</HI> This <HI>Eases</HI> the Soul. Whatever <HI>Distress</HI> be upon the Soul, Piety will say, <HI>Well, I will go tell my Father of it!</HI> If the Soul be in any Grief, Piety will <HI>Vent</HI> the Grief, in a <HI>Prayer</HI> to the Father of <HI>Mercies;</HI> A <HI>Prayer</HI> to the God who does <HI>not willingly Afflict or Grieve the Children of Men.</HI> The Re∣solution of Piety is, <HI>To be careful for no∣thing, but in every thing to present a Request unto the Lord:</HI> Then follows, Phil. IV. 7. <HI>The Peace of God shall Garrison your Heart and Minds thro' Christ Jesus;</HI> at such a rate, that the Enemies of your Tranquility shall not be able to break in up¦on you. Indeed, the <HI>Heart knows its own Bitterness;</HI> and we often know <HI>the Plague of our own Heart;</HI> A <HI>Grief</HI> that is known to none but our <HI>own Heart;</HI> none but <HI>we our selves</HI> are privy to it. But now, Piety will put this <HI>Grief</HI> into a
<PB N="18" REF="001624_0017_0FB3E36FE7BE5CB8"/><HI>Prayer,</HI> and so carry it unto the Lord. A <HI>Grief</HI> carried thither, is <HI>eased</HI> by being so. Either the <HI>Ground</HI> of the Grief is re∣moved, or else the <HI>Sense</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Grief is asswaged; when it is by <HI>Prayer</HI> spread before the Lord. We Read of one who was of a <HI>sorrowful Spirit,</HI> 1. Sam. I. 18. She could say, <HI>I have poured out my Soul unto the Lord;</HI> And anon, <HI>Her Counte∣nance was no more Sad.</HI> Oh! No such <HI>Anodyne,</HI> for an unquiet Soul! A <HI>Praying</HI> Posture is an <HI>Easy</HI> Posture for the Soul. To fall down on the Knees, this <HI>eases</HI> the Soul. It was urged, Psal. LXXXVI. 4. <HI>Rejoice the Soul of thy Servant; for un∣to thee, O Lord, I do lift up my Soul.</HI> Veri∣ly, To <HI>lift up the Soul unto the Lord,</HI> this Comforts the Soul, Gladdens the Soul, <HI>Eases</HI> the Soul: A <HI>Praying Soul</HI> takes the way to be an <HI>Easy Soul.</HI> There is no Case but <HI>Prayer</HI> will suit it: It is the <HI>Universal Medicine.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. Piety <HI>Assures</HI> the Soul, that those Things, which most threaten the <HI>Ease</HI> of the Soul, shall but promote the <HI>Good</HI> of it. The <HI>Fear of God</HI> will bring us to <HI>Dwell in Good,</HI> because it assures us, that nothing shall befal us, but what shall
<PB N="19" REF="001624_0018_0FB3E3716C282F18"/><HI>do us Good.</HI> So to <HI>Dwell in Good,</HI> is to <HI>Dwell at Ease.</HI> That which will not let us be <HI>Easy,</HI> is the <HI>Calamity</HI> whereto we are obnoxious. Our <HI>Disasters</HI> do spoil and break our <HI>Ease.</HI> We think we are <HI>Hurt,</HI> or we fear that we <HI>shall</HI> be so. But Piety brings us under the covert of that Word; Rom. VIII. 28. <HI>All things shall work together for Good, unto them that love God.</HI> Ah, Soul, that cannot be <HI>Easy!</HI> The Affliction which Discomposes thee, and will not let thee be at <HI>Ease,</HI> will do thee no <HI>Hurt.</HI> It is a <HI>Faithful God,</HI> who sends thy Affliction upon thee; One who says, <HI>I will do thee no Hurt:</HI> And thou shalt certainly find, <HI>That God has meant it unto Good.</HI> An excellent Servant of God, sadly tortured with the Stone, would in the midst of his Affliction cry out, <HI>I am upon my Fathers Rack.</HI> Child, Tho' thou mayst be upon a <HI>Rack,</HI> yet it is thy <HI>Fathers Rack!</HI> Afflicted Soul, Consider this; Realize this; <HI>My God is doing of me Good, by all His afflictive Dis∣pensations!</HI> Why shouldest thou not be at <HI>Ease,</HI> when thou art sure, that a∣non thy Experience will be that; Psal. CXIX. 7. <HI>It is good for me that I have
<PB N="20" REF="001624_0019_0FB3E372E77768A8"/>been Afflicted.</HI> Oh! <HI>Be at Ease;</HI> Thy <HI>Po∣verty</HI> comes to make thee <HI>Rich in Faith.</HI> The <HI>Reproaches</HI> on thy Name, are to fit thee for a <HI>Crown of Glory.</HI> The <HI>Loss of thy Friend,</HI> is that thou mayst have the <HI>Good part that cannot be taken away. Be Easy;</HI> This <HI>Affliction,</HI> which <HI>for the present is not Joyous but Grievous,</HI> will <HI>Afterwards, Af∣terwards!</HI>—be found for thy Benefit. The <HI>Fruits</HI> of it, will be such as will Ex∣press the <HI>Righteousness</HI> and Faithfulness of God, in all His Dealings with thee: <HI>Peacable Fruits:</HI> Oh! let thy Soul be at <HI>Ease,</HI> and in <HI>Peace,</HI> from the Prospect of them! That Hope, <HI>All for the Best, All for the Best!</HI> Methinks, it may always keep a Soul <HI>at Ease.</HI> A Soul ever Sailing on the <HI>pacific Sea;</HI> while Bound unto the <HI>Port</HI> which I am now presently to tell you of.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Piety will provide a <HI>Dwelling</HI> for the SOUL, <HI>after Death;</HI> and so <HI>good</HI> a <HI>Dwelling,</HI> that the <HI>Ease of Soul</HI> in it, will be <HI>Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!</HI> The Blessings of the <HI>Life to come,</HI> are now, as I foretold, come unto us. The <HI>Fear of God</HI> provides an <HI>Easy Dwelling</HI> for the Soul of the Good Man, at the
<PB N="21" REF="001624_0020_0FB3E37493D1EDC8"/>Time when his <HI>Seed Inherits the Earth.</HI> At the time of our <HI>Death,</HI> it is that our Children enter upon the <HI>Inheritance</HI> that we leave unto them, and make their Di∣vision of it. At <HI>this time</HI> the Soul of a Good Man shall have a <HI>Dwelling in Good;</HI> It shall dwell in a <HI>good State,</HI> and in a <HI>good Place,</HI> and therefore <HI>dwell at Ease.</HI> I am obliged unto the Famous <HI>Alting</HI> the Younger for this Illustration. The <HI>Immortality of the Soul</HI> is plainly Con∣fessed and Asserted in this Expectation. The <HI>New-Testament</HI> has most plainly Testified this Article of our Faith: It is not possible for any Words to be plainer or fuller for this Purpose, than those Words of our Saviour; Matth. X. 28. <HI>They that Kill the Body, are not able to Kill the Soul.</HI> But Sirs, you see the <HI>Old Testament</HI> also acknowledges it; An <HI>Easy Dwelling</HI> for a prepared Soul, when it leaves the <HI>Body.</HI> Let no Man be now so Bruitish, as to make any Doubt, whe∣ther he has an <HI>Immortal Soul</HI> or no. There is a late Infamous Bigot, whom they will needs have to pass for a very <HI>Learned</HI> Man; that for a notable Proof of his Learning, has written a Discourse
<PB N="22" REF="001624_0021_0FB3E375E920B3A8"/>to prove <HI>from the Scriptures and the First Fathers, that the Soul is a Principle natu∣rally Mortal.</HI> You have seen the <HI>Scriptures</HI> Condemn that Foolish Man; and one cannot well Imagine, with what Face, he could call in the <HI>Fathers</HI> to Patro∣nize his wicked Opinion. I may not be allow'd here to Digress for the Confu∣tation of an Assertion made with so much of an Impudence, that cannot be accounted for: But I hope, <HI>Justin Mar∣tyr</HI> may pass for one of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> who in his <HI>Apology,</HI> over and over a∣gain asserts, All <HI>Departed Souls</HI> to be in a <HI>state of Sensibility;</HI> All of them to have a <HI>Sensation</HI> continued unto them. Well, but what comes of a God-fearing, and so a prepared Soul, when it must no longer <HI>Dwell</HI> in the <HI>Body?</HI> The <HI>Soul</HI> is by Death, turned out of its <HI>Dwelling;</HI> turned out of Doors. But a <HI>Regenerated</HI> Soul, a Sanctified Soul, a Purified Soul, finds a <HI>Dwelling</HI> at its Departure hence; A Comfortable <HI>Dwelling;</HI> A <HI>Dwelling</HI> where it shall <HI>be comforted.</HI> Our Saviour who is gone to prepare them for us, has told us, Luk. XVI. 9. <HI>When ye fail, they shall receive you into everlasting Habitations.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="001624_0022_0FB3E377725FB8B0"/>Our Sin has brought us into <HI>Debt</HI> unto the Justice of God. When we <HI>Die,</HI> the Creditor comes upon us for the <HI>Debt.</HI> Then <HI>we fail;</HI> we are <HI>Broke;</HI> we are <HI>Bankrupts.</HI> Our <HI>Dwelling</HI> is taken from us. We are turned out of All. But <HI>Then!</HI> our Compassionate Saviour has <HI>Habita∣tions</HI> for us, in His <HI>Heavenly Mansions.</HI> An Excellent Minister in <HI>Hereford-shire,</HI> not very long ago, uttering these Words, <HI>We know, that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have,</HI>— There he stopt; There he faltered; There he expired. Instead of Speaking the rest, he went unto it. I will now speak it.— <HI>A Building of God, an House not made with Hands, Eternally in the Heavens.</HI> Would you know where the <HI>Dwelling</HI> is? Our Saviour said unto the Dying Penitent; Luk. XXIII. 43. <HI>This Day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</HI> Piety will bring to <HI>Paradise.</HI> The <HI>Dwell∣ing</HI> of a Soul distinguished by Piety, shall be in the <HI>Paradise</HI> of God: That which <HI>Tertullian</HI> calls <HI>Locum Divinae Amae∣nitatis recipiendis Sanctorum Spiritibus De∣stinatum.</HI> Soul, During the <HI>Sleep</HI> of Death, and in the <HI>Days of Darkness,</HI> This, this
<PB N="24" REF="001624_0023_0FB3E378F8108DE8"/>will be the <HI>Lodging</HI> of the Soul: A <HI>Pa∣radise,</HI> where no <HI>Sin,</HI> and by Conse∣quence, no <HI>Sorrow</HI> will cleave unto the Soul. A <HI>Paradise,</HI> where the Soul will be elevated unto such <HI>Contemplations</HI> of Him, as to render it after some sort, <HI>present with the Lord:</HI> A <HI>Paradise,</HI> where the Soul shall <HI>Feed on the Tree of Life,</HI> and be refreshed by the Principle of <HI>Grace,</HI> which God has planted in it. O most <HI>easy Dwelling!</HI> We Read of the Dying Saints; Isa. LVII. 2. They <HI>enter into Peace, they rest in their Beds.</HI> Of the Soul Dwelling in such a <HI>Paradise,</HI> we Read, <HI>It is Comforted.</HI> There is nothing to ren∣der the Dwelling of such a Soul <HI>Uneasy,</HI> but only its remaining under that part of the <HI>Curse;</HI> Its <HI>Body</HI> left Rotten in the <HI>Grave;</HI> and the Delay of the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> which it is waiting and long∣ing for. But even this Matter of <HI>Uneasi∣ness</HI> is made <HI>Easy,</HI> by some Visions of a Glorious CHRIST in the mean time enjoy'd, and the glad Assurance of be∣ing er'e long Raised, and then taken in∣to the City of God.</P>
<P>¶ But we will proceed now, to the Advantage which our Piety will bring
<PB N="25" REF="001624_0024_0FB3E37A70BCE208"/>to <HI>Ours:</HI> The Advantage of an <HI>Happy Seed. Good Men have this good Thing to make them Easy; their Children after them shall fare the better for them.</HI></P>
<P>Let us Inform our selves upon what Account!</P>
<P>First. The Piety of <HI>Parents</HI> does bring their <HI>Children</HI> into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God. Pious Parents give up <HI>Themselves</HI> unto God, in His <HI>Covenant.</HI> But then, they give up their <HI>Children</HI> as well as <HI>Them∣selves;</HI> their Children as <HI>a part</HI> of Them∣selves. The Result is that; Gen. XVII. 7. <HI>An everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and unto thy Seed after thee.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Rich Inheritance</HI> of the <HI>Children</HI> thus brought into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, and of Grace! To <HI>Inherit the Earth,</HI> yea, to Inherit the whole World, is not so much as to have the great God in <HI>Covenant</HI> with us, for our <HI>Inheritance.</HI> It follows; If these Children Die in their <HI>Infancy,</HI> they have a Claim to all the Blessings of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> in the Eternal World. When the great GOD says, <HI>I will be the God of these Children,</HI> He intends, <HI>I will bring them to a part in the Heavenly City.</HI> O Pious Parents, your Dead Chil∣dren
<PB N="26" REF="001624_0025_0FB3E37C0203C328"/>are but gone before you, into the Suburbs, and some Foretastes of that <HI>Inheritance,</HI> which you have secured for them. Yea, this Clause, <HI>They shall Inhe∣rit the Earth,</HI> must be a little more nicely thought upon. There is an <HI>Earth</HI> to be <HI>Inherited</HI> by these <HI>Children:</HI> Even that <HI>New Earth,</HI> wherein shall <HI>dwell Righ∣teousness;</HI> that <HI>New Earth,</HI> over which they shall <HI>Reign, of whom is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> These <HI>Children of Abraham,</HI> are to be <HI>Heirs of the World;</HI> But in the <HI>World to come.</HI> When you Read of, <HI>In∣heriting the Earth,</HI> O Saints, look for∣ward, as far as <HI>that</HI> World, for the Ex∣plaining, and the Fulfilling of it. If these Children should survive their <HI>Infancy,</HI> the <HI>Covenant</HI> has ensured this, That they shall have an <HI>Offer</HI> of the Gospel; That Christ, and Grace, and Heaven, shall be <HI>Offered</HI> unto them. <HI>Unto them first</HI> is that Saviour sent, that would <HI>Bless them in turning them from their Iniquities.</HI> O In∣valuable Priviledge!</P>
<P>Secondly. Piety in Parents, does dis∣pose them to pursue a <HI>Good Education</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> Of a Pious Parent, it was said in Gen. XVIII. 19. <HI>I know him,
<PB N="27" REF="001624_0026_0FB3E37E34A6E990"/>that he will Command his Children, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> Even so, Such a Parent, <HI>I know him;</HI> He will instil the <HI>Principles of Religion</HI> into his Children: They shall be well Cate∣chized Children. Such a Parent, <HI>I know him,</HI> He will inform his Children how to fly from <HI>Sin,</HI> and turn to <HI>God,</HI> and close with <HI>Christ,</HI> and walk in a Con∣formity to the Doctrines of the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> Such a Parent, <HI>I know him,</HI> He will Advise his Children against the Pathes of the Destroyer, and restrain them and rescue them with all possible Agony from those Destructive Ways. 'Tis a vast Felicity, to have such an <HI>Education!</HI> But there is one Point of <HI>Education</HI> more, that such a Parent will bestow upon his Children. He will find out a fit <HI>Employment</HI> for his Children: He will have them taught some <HI>Employ∣ment,</HI> by which they may <HI>Inherit</HI> as much of the <HI>Earth</HI> as may be needful for them, and they may be Useful in their Gene∣ration: He will not bear, that they should be brought up in <HI>Idleness,</HI> and prove meer <HI>Drones</HI> in the Hive of the Common-wealth. He makes to the
<PB N="28" REF="001624_0027_0FB3E37FC57AF058"/>World, an Honourable Present of <HI>Well-educated Children!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Piety is a <HI>Prayerful</HI> sort of a Thing. Pious Parents will <HI>Pray</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> Pious Parents are <HI>Praying</HI> Pa∣rents. They lay up a <HI>Stock of Prayers</HI> for their Children. We Read of such an One; Job I. 5. <HI>He offered Sacrifices accor∣ding to the Number of all his Children.— Thus did Job continually.</HI> The Prayers of an <HI>Abraham</HI> for his <HI>Ishmael, O my God, That my Son may Live in thy Sight!</HI> The Prayers of a <HI>David</HI> for his <HI>Solomon, O my God, That my Son may have a perfect Heart given to him!</HI> There is a mighty Effica∣cy in these Prayers. They <HI>avail much;</HI> Pious Parents are always <HI>Travailing</HI> for their Children with them. Children, These <HI>Prayers</HI> will not be lost. It will be <HI>your Fault,</HI> if they be! The <HI>Relations</HI> that have been given in the Histories of the Church, concerning the Success of Prayer made by Pious Parents for their Children, before and after the Days of <HI>Monica</HI> have been many and Marvel∣lous. I will now single out One, which perhaps you have not met withal. I know the Name of a Worthy Man, who liv'd
<PB N="29" REF="001624_0028_0FB3E381365A5A38"/>some while since in the County of <HI>Corn∣wal;</HI> and who had a Son wandring from God, and from him, under a very Vici∣ous Character. He procured a Number of Ministers to join with him, in a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> for the Conversion of that <HI>Pro∣digal Son.</HI> On <HI>that very Day,</HI> Behold, the Prodigal returned, with a new Temper and Biass of Soul given to him. God blessed a Calamity that befel him, for his Awakening and Conversion; And from <HI>that very Day</HI> he became a New Creature, and a Servant of God. After∣wards this Worthy Man, when he lay a Dying, said, <HI>I have Ten Children, where∣of Nine are in Christ; God has converted Nine of them to serious Piety. I Die Be∣lieving for the Tenth; He also shall be brought home unto God.</HI> And this also was accom∣plished. Verily, The Children of such Parents, are not soon to be despaired of!</P>
<P>Fourthly. The <HI>Piety</HI> of <HI>Parents,</HI> does often bespeak <HI>Prosperity</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> We Read; Prov. XX. 7. <HI>The Just Man walketh in his Integrity; His Children are blessed after him.</HI> 'Tis often so; Pious Parents have their Piety often <HI>Rewarded</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="001624_0029_0FB3E382B4F76AF0"/>in the Prosperity of their <HI>Children.</HI> They get their Estates Honestly; they wear well; their <HI>Children Inherit the Earth</HI> which they leave unto them; the <HI>Third Heir</HI> it may be Rejoices in what was left by his Grandfather. More than this; <HI>Pious Parents</HI> devote a <HI>Good Portion</HI> of their Estates to <HI>Pious</HI> Uses. Yea, I must say unto you, They ALL do so! <HI>I</HI> say again, whatever Havock the Assertion may make among some <HI>Covetous Hypo∣crites,</HI> They ALL do so. Now, this lays up a <HI>Good Portion</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> The Parents <HI>devise Liberal Things;</HI> the Children reap the Harvest of that Libe∣rality. The <HI>Alms</HI> dispensed by the Pa∣rents, are a <HI>Seed</HI> sown in the Earth for the Children. 'Tis to <HI>cast the Bread-corn into moist Ground,</HI> [which we are directed to do, Eccl. XI. 1. For 'tis to be Tran∣slated so:] It will <HI>be seen after many Days.</HI> The Children will have the Crop. After their <HI>Parents</HI> are laid in the <HI>Earth,</HI> even then the Children, as the Reward of their Piety, do <HI>Inherit the Earth.</HI> If the knowledge of their Children do∣ing well, should arrive unto the <HI>Souls</HI> of the Parents <HI>Dwelling at Ease,</HI>— But
<PB N="31" REF="001624_0030_0FB3E384293DCCE0"/>these are <HI>Secret Things.</HI> And I know, of whom it is said, <HI>His Sons come to Ho∣nour, and he knoweth it not.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Let the Antithesis now be call'd in; An Admonition Hearken'd to, that is to be Trembled at. <HI>The Soul of a Wick∣ed Man may not be at Ease;</HI> nay, can∣not be at Ease. Ah, Impenitent Sinner, Where, where is thy <HI>Dwelling?</HI> Thy <HI>Dwelling</HI> is under an <HI>Old Covenant,</HI> which speaks to thee none but very <HI>Uneasy Things;</HI> even those Things, Isa. III. 10. <HI>Wo unto the Wicked, it shall be ill with him.</HI> It was of Old said, <HI>Wo to them that are at Ease in Zion.</HI> But, O Sinner in <HI>Zion,</HI> How can you be at <HI>Ease</HI> when you think on the <HI>Wo</HI> that lies upon you? Is it not an <HI>Uneasy</HI> Thing, to lye under the <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Curse</HI> of God? An <HI>Uneasy</HI> Thing, to be a <HI>Slave</HI> unto <HI>Sin,</HI> unto <HI>Sa∣tan,</HI> unto the most Cruel of all Task-masters? An <HI>Uneasy</HI> Thing, to be in hourly Danger of being siezed by the <HI>Messengers of Death,</HI> and forced away be∣fore the Tribunal of a Righteous and a
<PB N="32" REF="001624_0031_0FB3E385B06DE748"/>Terrible God? Ah, poor Soul, Unre∣conciled unto God; There is Danger, lest thy <HI>Dwelling</HI> be quickly in a Place of <HI>Torments;</HI> in the Place of <HI>Dragons!</HI> The Revelation which never deluded any Man, has forewarned thee of such a <HI>Place:</HI> 'Tis no Delusion! Oh! <HI>Who can dwill with everlasting Burnings?</HI> But Sinful, and secure Soul, thou are in hourly Danger of going down to such an <HI>uneasy Dwelling.</HI> How, how canst thou <HI>Dwell at Ease,</HI> in this Condition? It was demanded of such as you, Jam. V. 1. <HI>Weep and Howl for the Miseries that shall come upon you.</HI> Verily, The first and the best Thing to be desired for you is, That you may not have a Soul <HI>dwelling at Ease</HI> in this Condition. I Wish thee very well, my Friend; But I cannot express a more Charitable Wish for thee than this; That thou mayst feel <HI>no Ease</HI> in thy Soul, till thou art got out of this Condition. <HI>Good God, make thou the Souls of our Unconverted Children, very Uneasy, while they continue so!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. But now, let none that <HI>Fear God,</HI> be <HI>Enemies</HI> to the <HI>Ease</HI> of their <HI>Souls.</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="001624_0032_0FB3E3872B7A2468"/>O Pious ones, don't <HI>refuse to be Comfored.</HI> Don't reject the <HI>Legacy</HI> of your <HI>Dying Saviour.</HI> Don't give way to any Over∣whelming and Unreasonable <HI>Uneasiness</HI> of Soul. That the <HI>Exhortation</HI> which now <HI>speaks unto you, as unto Children,</HI> may ob∣tain, you have three Things incumbent on you.</P>
<P>One thing you have to do, is this. Your <HI>Title</HI> to an <HI>Easy Soul</HI> should be cleared up. You should get a clear Sight of it, and a well-grounded Assurance, <HI>That you are in good Terms with Heaven.</HI> Where∣fore, <HI>Examine</HI> your selves; with an Im∣partial <HI>Examination</HI> faithfully Search and Try your selves. Ask, <HI>Have I so Renounc∣ed all my Idols, that the great God is now on the Throne in my Soul, above them all? And that He sways more with me than any of them?</HI> Ask, <HI>Have I embraced my Love∣ly Saviour in all His Offices, and earnestly Repaired unto Him for all the Benefits of His Great Salvation?</HI> Ask, <HI>Do I walk in the Fear of God, aw'd by His Eye upon me, lothe to Displease Him? Have I an Un∣dissembled Love unto my Neighbour, and a Joy in his Wellfare? Is this World of less Account with me than the World to come?</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="001624_0033_0FB3E388B65685C0"/>To put it out of Doubt, that these Things are in you, Renew, Repeat, Re∣vive those <HI>Acts</HI> of the Soul, which may make you feel the Presence of them. Do those Things in a way of <HI>Mourning</HI> for Sin, and <HI>Turning</HI> to God, which when they are done, your Souls may &amp; should then <HI>Dwell at Ease;</HI> The <HI>Things which accompany Salvation.</HI> And now say; Psal. XLIII. <HI>5. Why art thou cast down, O my Soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet Praise Him.</HI></P>
<P>Another thing you have to do, is this; Don't listen to <HI>Temptations</HI> that would give <HI>causeless Disturbance</HI> to the <HI>Ease</HI> of your Souls. A busy Tempter, who <HI>seeks Rest and finds none,</HI> is he who breaks yours as much as he can. But as you Read; Psal. XI. 1. <HI>In the Lord I put my Trust. How say ye to my Soul, Flee as a Bird unto your Mountain?</HI> Thus Repel them who <HI>Trouble</HI> you:
<Q><HI>How say ye to my Soul,</HI> Thy <HI>Sins</HI> are too many, too heinous, to be Forgiven? <HI>I put my Trust</HI> in the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Son of God, which <HI>cleanseth from all Sin? How say ye to my Soul,</HI> The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> is utterly departed from
<PB N="35" REF="001624_0034_0FB3E38A24ACC758"/>thee? <HI>I put my Trust,</HI> That I have the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> at Work upon me, even in my <HI>Fears</HI> of His Departure? <HI>How say ye to my Soul,</HI> Thou hast such an <HI>hard Heart,</HI> as carries the Mark of one Rejected of God? My <HI>Trust</HI> is, That my Heart begins to <HI>Soften,</HI> inasmuch as I begin to feel the <HI>hardness</HI> of it.</Q></P>
<P>A third Thing you have to do is this; Lye down upon a <HI>Pillow</HI> stuff'd with the <HI>Promises.</HI> A Soul supplied with, and applying of the <HI>Promises,</HI> may soon come to this <HI>Easiness?</HI> Psal. IV. 8. <HI>I will lay me down in Peace, and Sleep; for O Lord, thou alone makest me Dwell in Safety.</HI> In the Poetical Antiquity and Mythology, there was a Celebrated <HI>Nepenthes,</HI> [or <HI>No-Grief</HI>] an admirable Remedy, which put an end unto all Sorrow and Anger, and caused People to forget all their Ex∣ercises. No Man could Weep (said the Poets) in the Day that he tasted it, tho' he had lost the Dearest Friend in the World. The Phylosophers try to have the Properties of it answered in <HI>Opium.</HI> No, Sirs, 'Tis nothing but our <HI>Glorious Gospel,</HI> that will after all, afford the true <HI>Nepenthes.</HI> In the <HI>Promises</HI> of
<PB N="36" REF="001624_0035_0FB3E38BD16994A0"/>our <HI>Glorious Gospel</HI> alone it is, that we have a genuine Cure for all that brings any of our <HI>Uneasiness</HI> upon us. My Brethren, There are <HI>Promises</HI> that will suit all your Occasions of <HI>Uneasiness.</HI> Are you <HI>Uneasy,</HI> because you see <HI>Poverty com∣ing in like an Armed Man</HI> upon you? Take that <HI>Promise,</HI> and make a Living upon it; Psal. XXXIV. 10. <HI>They that seek the Lord, shall not want any good Thing.</HI> Does the Death of any <HI>Desirable Relatives</HI> make you <HI>Uneasy?</HI> Take that <HI>Promise,</HI> and what it brings with it, instead of them all: Heb. XIII. 5. <HI>He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> Does the view of your own <HI>Approaching Death</HI> make you <HI>Uneasy?</HI> Take that <HI>Pro∣mise,</HI> for a <HI>Rod</HI> and a <HI>Staff,</HI> to walk thro' <HI>Hazar-maveth</HI> withal; Psal. XXIII. 4. <HI>Tho' I walk thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil; For thou art with me.</HI> Are you <HI>Uneasy</HI> because of <HI>Pe∣rils</HI> that you are near to, and must go thro'? Take that <HI>Promise,</HI> and make a <HI>Cordial</HI> of it; Isa. XLI. 10. <HI>Fear not, for I am with thee; Be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the
<PB N="37" REF="001624_0036_0FB3E38D2BC202D8"/>Right Hand of my Righteousness.</HI> Do the Thoughss of the <HI>Orphans,</HI> which you are, you know not how soon, to leave in an evil World, make you <HI>Uneasy?</HI> Take that <HI>Promise,</HI> and look on it, as a competent and perpetual <HI>Fund,</HI> for them to subsist upon; Psal. XXVII. 11. <HI>When my Father and my Mother forsake me, the Lord will take me up.</HI> Who can be <HI>Un∣easy</HI> in the midst of such Accommodati∣ons; or be in <HI>Straits</HI> in the midst of such <HI>Sufficiency?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Children</HI> of Pious Parents, must attend unto the Counsils of God. YOU, my Children, have <HI>something</HI> to do, that you may be the better for your <HI>Parents.</HI> And I will tell you, what that <HI>something</HI> is. You must lay hold on the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God for your selves; and heartily <HI>say unto the Lord, Thou art my God.</HI> You must come into this Disposi∣tion; <HI>O Great GOD, has my Parent cho∣sen thee? I also do make Choice of thee, to be my God!</HI> And, Child, <HI>Wilt thou not from this</HI> Time, come into that Resolution, <HI>Lord, Thou art my Father, and thou shalt be the Guide of my Youth?</HI> Truly, the Language now expected from you, is
<PB N="38" REF="001624_0037_0FB3E38EB81ADAA0"/>that; Exod. XV. 2. <HI>The Lord is my God, and I will prepare Him an Habitation: My Fathers God, and I will Exalt Him.</HI> Here∣withal, you must Conform to the De∣fires of your Pious Parents. Thwart them not; Grieve them not; cause not an <HI>Heavy Heart</HI> unto them; Don't make them <HI>Uneasy.</HI> Be not the Sons of <HI>Eli,</HI> who <HI>hearkned not unto the Voice of their Fa∣ther.</HI> You know the Doom, and the Death of those miserable Children! Yet more; Your Pious Parents have pray'd for you; have made Thousands of <HI>Prayers</HI> for you, with <HI>strong Crying and Tears.</HI> But you must <HI>Pray for your selves,</HI> if you would fare the better for the <HI>Prayers</HI> of your <HI>Parents.</HI> Nor can you fare the better for your <HI>Pious Parents,</HI> except you tread in the Steps of their Piety. Remember Their <HI>Piety</HI> will but aggravate your <HI>Per∣dition,</HI> if you continue <HI>Impious.</HI> We Read of <HI>One in Hell,</HI> which cryed out, <HI>Father Abraham, I am Tormented in this Flame.</HI> O Children whose Parents have been the <HI>Friends</HI> of God, If you are found a∣mong His <HI>Enemies,</HI> as your <HI>Impiety</HI> will declare you to be <HI>such,</HI> you will be thrown into <HI>Hell,</HI> and your Damnation
<PB N="39" REF="001624_0038_0FB3E3903998FAD8"/>there, will be the more Exquisite and Horrible for the <HI>Parents</HI> which you are descended from. Your <HI>Parents</HI> will be∣come your <HI>Torments:</HI> And the Remem∣brance of what they did for you, and how you have Sinn'd against it all, will <HI>Torment</HI> you wonderfully; the Smoak, and the Cry of such <HI>Torments,</HI> will <HI>As∣cend for ever and ever!</HI> So did the Thun∣dring <HI>Baptist,</HI> warn the Children of Pi∣ous Parents; Matth. III. 9, 10. <HI>Think not to say within your selves, we have Abraham to our Father. Every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the Fire.</HI> I see, I see, Oh! what Numbers of our poor Children, in a Course of Impiety, throwing themselves down into that <HI>Unquenchable Fire.</HI> A most Lamentable Spectacle! <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver their Souls!</HI></P>
<P>¶ But it is time for me, in my <HI>Histo∣rical</HI> way, which one would think should be a very <HI>Significant</HI> way, to Clinch the Nails which I have hitherto been driv∣ing. And I may upon a due Reflection, make this Report unto you, That the <HI>Religious Matron</HI> who yesterday with∣drew from us, was One, in whom the
<PB N="40" REF="001624_0039_0FB3E391A8DC8E58"/>Truths which have now been delivered, concerning a <HI>Soul</HI> Dwelling and preserv∣ed in <HI>Ease</HI> by a <HI>Piety,</HI> and an <HI>Offspring</HI> rendred, and by themselves and others esteem'd, Happy, in <HI>Pious Parents,</HI> have been in a very Conspicuous Degree ex∣emplified. Such a <HI>Good Report</HI> she has <HI>of all, and of the Truth it self.</HI> I also must make a Record of it, and <HI>my Record shall be true.</HI></P>
<P>We are not <HI>Bribed</HI> by the <HI>Riches</HI> of them who <HI>Dye and are buried,</HI> for to bear any flattering and fulsome Testimonies for them. Nothing without a <HI>Shining Pi∣ety</HI> in our Friends, can obtain our Testi∣monies: Tho' sometimes <HI>Public Stations,</HI> or such things as place Persons in the Light of more <HI>Public Observation,</HI> may invite us to Enlarge upon them. <HI>Philip de Comines</HI> complaines of it, That when he expostulated with a <HI>Carthusian,</HI> for putting the Term of a <HI>Saint</HI> on one that had been a Person of a very evil Cha∣racter, his Monk replied upon him, <HI>Syr, We always make a Saint of a Benefactor.</HI> I hope, that you will find <HI>Us</HI> clear of that Scandal; and that you have often found us most Expatiate in Commend∣ing
<PB N="41" REF="001624_0040_0FB3E39331825CB8"/>such <HI>Saints</HI> as have laid us under no <HI>Temporal</HI> and <HI>Personal</HI> Obligations.</P>
<P>The Excellent Father of this Gentle∣woman, and of this Country, (whose <HI>Life</HI> makes a Great Article among the MAGNALIA of <HI>New-England,</HI>) would in her Childhood, often present her to them that came to see him, and say with a peculiar Satisfaction, <HI>This is my</HI> New-England <HI>Token!</HI> because a good God had sent her to him, as a <HI>Token</HI> of His Favour to his Family, so soon after his coming to <HI>New-England.</HI> And I know not why <HI>New-England</HI> should not now present her to the World, as a <HI>Token</HI> of the Divine Favour to a Country, which He has adorned with such bright Jewels, as do surpass those of the Orient. When she lay at the Point of Death in her Minority, and was indeed given over for Dead, while Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> was at Prayer with her, the Heart of her Father was raised unto a <HI>particular Faith</HI> for it, which he immediately declared, <HI>That the Child should Live!</HI> And now, having out-lived the Eightieth Year of her Age, I have an Opportunity to tell you, what sort of a <HI>Life</HI> it was, which that
<PB N="42" REF="001624_0041_0FB3E394A3716128"/>Prayer of my Grandfather, had its Re∣markable Answer in. It was a <HI>Life</HI> of the most exemplary <HI>Piety</HI> in all the parts of it; And my Sermon has all along done little more than tell <HI>her</HI> Story, when it has told you, what the <HI>Fear of God</HI> will do, and what <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> it will bring unto.</P>
<P>While she was a Wife, to a most va∣luable Servant of God, Mr. SAMUEL DANFORTH, the Pastor of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> she was no Stranger to Afflictions; es∣pecially in the Infirmity and Mortality of <HI>many Children.</HI> But by being thus Afflicted, she was but the more improv∣ed in that <HI>Piety</HI> which made her <HI>Honour∣able</HI> in the Eyes of all that have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> at all directing of their Senti∣ments.</P>
<P>As those Holy Women that bore a part in the <HI>First Voyages</HI> to this Wilder∣ness, were those <HI>Good Things,</HI> than which <HI>the World</HI> had not many to show, that were <HI>Better,</HI> or more worthy to be had in <HI>Everlasting Remembrance:</HI> Thus <HI>our Land</HI> hath not many Things to be more boast∣ed of, than a set of Holy Women found among <HI>their Daughters,</HI> who have been
<PB N="43" REF="001624_0042_0FB3E3963B539B58"/><HI>Polished Stones in the Temple of God,</HI> and Patterns of the Things that are <HI>Holy, and Just, and Good.</HI> WOMEN, that have most entirely given themselves up unto God, and studied and practised <HI>Ho∣liness in all manner of Conversation: Wo∣men,</HI> that have known and lov'd a dear SAVIOUR, and <HI>liv'd by the Faith of the Son of God: Women,</HI> that have walk'd with God, in the <HI>Religion of the Closet,</HI> and set an high Price on Communion with Him in the <HI>Assemblies of Zion: Wo∣men,</HI> that have been Wise, and Good, and most Obliging in all <HI>Relations,</HI> and bestow'd upon their Children an agree∣able <HI>Education: Women,</HI> that have with incomparable Patience and Meekness, entertained the <HI>Cross</HI> that has been or∣dered for them: <HI>Women,</HI> that have been <HI>Blessings</HI> to their Neighbours, and been helpful in a Thousand kind of Offices among the Distressed in their Neigh∣bourhood. <HI>Such</HI> was this Handmaid of the Lord; and among <HI>such, a Star of the first Magnitude.</HI></P>
<P>For near Twice seven Years before she Died, her <HI>Sight</HI> was utterly taken from her. But, Oh! the <HI>Light arising to
<PB N="44" REF="001624_0043_0FB3E397D0961FD0"/>her in all her Darkness!</HI> Some that have been <HI>Blind all their Days,</HI> have yet been such <HI>Illuminated Persons,</HI> that they have been Eminent <HI>Preachers</HI> of the Gospel, yea, most notable <HI>Writers,</HI> for the De∣fence and Service of it. Among such Sons of <HI>Bartimaeus,</HI> I know not that the <HI>Armies of the Living God,</HI> ever had a more Illustrious Champion than that most accomplished Literator, the present <HI>Professor of History</HI> in the University of <HI>Glasgow:</HI> [Mr. WILLIAM JAMESON.] A <HI>Sampson</HI> by whose Hand God pulls down the Temple of the <HI>Romish Phi∣listines!</HI> I snatch at an Occasion to men∣tion this Miraculous Man, because I have really wish'd and fought an Occasion to Express my Desires that his Learned Books were more Common among us Others there have been, who have only lain <HI>Blind in their Latter Days;</HI> but yet have in the <HI>Light of God</HI> so <HI>seen Light</HI> that they have been able to <HI>Guide others</HI> in the ways of God, and <HI>shew them the Pathes of Life.</HI> And such an One was this Handmaid of God; One under <HI>To∣tal Blindness,</HI> yet Gloriously Resembling the <HI>Living Creatures that are full of Eyes!</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="001624_0044_0FB3E3992CF189F8"/>When the acute <HI>Milton</HI> had lost his Eyes, he Comforted himself with this; <HI>Orbi∣tatem certe Luminis quidni leniter feram, quod non tam amissum, quam Revecatum intus atque Retractum, ad acuendam potius mentis Aciem quam ad hebetandam sperem.</HI> 'My <HI>Sight</HI> is only call'd <HI>Inward,</HI> that it 'may be <HI>sharpened</HI> there. And he argu∣ed, That as <HI>Man lives not by Bread alone, but by the Word of God,</HI> we see not with our <HI>Eyes alone,</HI> but by being under the Wise and Kind Conduct of God. Thus this Pious Person had her <HI>Sight,</HI> but as it were turned the more <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Up∣ward</HI> by her <HI>Blindness,</HI> and fixed upon those Things which had hitherto been the Object of her <HI>Faith.</HI> She gained a <HI>stronger Sight</HI> of <HI>Him that is Invisible;</HI> a <HI>clearer View</HI> of the <HI>Things which are not seen and are Eternal. Cicero</HI> affirms, <HI>Democ∣ritus</HI> easily comforted himself under the loss of his Ey-sight by this; That if he was not able to distinguish <HI>Black</HI> from <HI>White,</HI> yet he could perfectly well discern <HI>Good</HI> from <HI>Ill, Right</HI> from <HI>Wrong.</HI> This Pious Person, One <HI>more Wise unto Salvation</HI> than any that the Roman Ora∣tor had ever heard of, when God call'd
<PB N="46" REF="001624_0045_0FB3E39AB05A0958"/>her to make her <HI>Sight</HI> a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> unto Him, had this Reparation of her Blind∣ness, that she had the more <HI>Lively Sight</HI> of Things in the Kingdom of God; she more distinctly view'd those Things, which if they could be seen with our Eyes, we would find the <HI>Love</HI> of them <HI>Wondrously raised</HI> in us. Every one will Delight and Wonder saw, <HI>A Soul dwell∣ing in Ease!</HI> Her <HI>Submission</HI> to the <HI>Will of God:</HI> Her Admirations of what <HI>she saw</HI> in a most endeared JESUS: Her <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to them who brought the <HI>Word of God</HI> unto her, which was con∣tinually done by one or other, almost all the Day long; Her <HI>Chamber</HI> a very <HI>Chappel</HI> wherein something of Devotion was ever going on; A little <HI>Anti-Cham∣ber</HI> of Heaven! The unexpressible Plea∣sure she took in <HI>Prayer</HI> to God: Her Fruitfulness in <HI>Religious Conferences:</HI> Her <HI>Affectionate Love</HI> to the Children of God: Her profound <HI>Humility,</HI> perpetual Self-Abasement, Self-Abhorence: And her lively Anhelation after the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> with a most finishing <HI>Resignation</HI> to her Saviour, for His own <HI>Time,</HI> and His own <HI>Way</HI> to bring her unto it.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="001624_0046_0FB3E39C292825E8"/>
It was impossible to see her in her <HI>Dying Hours,</HI> without seeing the ghastly Visage of DEATH Gloriously altered; and the meaning of, <HI>O Death, Where is thy Sting?</HI> tendered in a most noble Illu∣stration of it. And now, when her sense of every Thing in this World, was in a manner gone, if either CHRIST, or HEAVEN, were but mentioned, it seem'd as if the mention of those <HI>Two Words,</HI> infus'd a <HI>New Life</HI> into her. She made me think of that Excellent Lady, <HI>Olympia Fulvia Morata,</HI> who in her last Moments declar'd, <HI>That she had now got the Sight of a most Excellent Place, and a very Delightful one; ever Shining with an Astonishing Light and Brightness;</HI> Hasten∣ing whereto, her Triumph was, <HI>Tota sum laeta;</HI> I am now <HI>as full of Joy as I can hold;</HI> A Singular Happiness did she <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow and long enjoy in her <HI>Children,</HI> and their Tender and Helpful Behaviour. Her Two <HI>Sons,</HI> have long been Faithful and Painful and eminently Serviceable Ministers of the Gospel: Her Two <HI>Sons-in-Law</HI> have been as well <HI>Sons-in-Love</HI> unto her: And her <HI>Daughters</HI> have been worthy to be call'd <HI>Hers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="001624_0047_0FB3E39DB322C648"/>
And now her <HI>Soul</HI> is gone to <HI>Dwell in Ease,</HI> her dutiful Offspring, will doubt∣less <HI>Inherit</HI> so much of the <HI>Earth,</HI> as will Reward the Duty which they have so Examplarily paid unto her. But <HI>this</HI> is not what they so much propose: 'Tis the <HI>least</HI> of their Desires; as it was of <HI>Hers</HI> for them. An <HI>Heavenly Inheritance</HI> will be theirs; <HI>A Better and a Lasting Substance in Heaven!</HI>— If they go on to prefer and pursue <HI>That,</HI> as I hope they do, and walk in the steps of Pa∣rents, who have laid up so many Thou∣sands of Prayers, That they <HI>may do wor∣thily in Israel.</HI> And their Experience, how remarkably God has been a <HI>Father</HI> to them, since their Excellent <HI>Father</HI> left them <HI>Orphans</HI> in a difficult World, I hope, will be considered as an Encou∣ragement for all Godly <HI>Parents,</HI> and for their <HI>Children.</HI></P>
