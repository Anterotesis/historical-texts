<P>I Shall not now spend my time in inquir∣ing who <HI>Job</HI> was, in what time, and where he lived. Let two or three things be observed of him. (1.) That he was a very good Man, and had as he de∣served a high Character and Commendation bestowed upon him. He was <HI>perfect and up∣right,</HI> one <HI>that feared God and eschewed evil.</HI> (2.) Observe that this good Man met with heavy Afflictions, of which we have a Ca∣talogue in this Chapter, ver. 14, 15. <HI>There c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a messenger unto Job, and said, the Oxen were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowing, and the Asses feeding beside them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Sabeans fell upon them, &amp; took them away; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey have slain the Servants with the edge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sword, and I only am escaped to tell</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ver. 16. <HI>While he was yet speaking, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso another, and said, the fire of God is

fallen from Heaven, and hath burnt up the Sheep, and the Servants, and consumed them, and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</HI> ver. 17. <HI>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, the Caldeans made out three hands, and fell upon the Camels, and have car∣ried them away, yea, and slain the Servants with the edge of the sword, and I only am es∣caped to tell thee.</HI>ver. 18, 19. <HI>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, thy Sons and thy Daugthers were eating and drinking in their eldest brothers house; And behold there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead, and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</HI> Thus did deep call unto deep, so did this good Man's Afflictions (like waves of the Sea) came rolling in upon him, one after the other. The last of which was the heaviest and greatest of all. Let any one that knows what it is to be a Parent, lay his hand upon his Heart, and consider his own Bowels, and he will acknowledge, that the loss of Children is one of the sorest outward Afflictions that a Man can m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> withal in this World. And here I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make this <HI>Observation,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002545_0004_0FDB44E2F56641F0"/><HI>THAT a Man may be very near and dear to God▪ and yet meet with heavy Afflictions in this World.</HI></P>
<P>WE see this in the Example of <HI>Job,</HI> and in several others of God's dear Children whose Names are on record in the sacred Pages. Never was there a Person so near and dear to God as the Lord Jesus Christ was, yet he was a <HI>Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief.</HI> Now this teaches us not to judge of Men's Conditions, that they don't belong to God, because of their present sorrowful Visitations. We must judge of Persons by their Conversation towards God, not by God's Dispensations towards them. The greatest Sufferers are not always the great∣est Sinners. Luk. 13.2, 3. <HI>And Jesus ans∣wered, and said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Gali∣leans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay,</HI> &amp;c. ver. 4, 5. <HI>Or those eighteen, upon whom the Tower of Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they were sinners above all men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Jerusalem?

(3.) We may take notice of
<PB N="4" REF="002545_0005_0FDB461F3409EA28"/>
<HI>Job</HI>'s Carriage and Behaviour under his sharp Afflictions, ver. 20. <HI>He arose and rent his mantle, and sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his bead and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped.</HI> (1.) He had a deep sense of, and a just sorrow for the heavy hand of God, and was humbled under it, <HI>He arise and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground.</HI> Note here, that to take a due notice of the Hand of God in Afflictions, and to be hum∣bled under them, is what highly becomes a Christian. Indeed, to be excessively de∣jected, and cast down under Afflictions, so as to impair our Health, and incapacitate us for the Duties either of our particular or general Calling, is what Christians should endeavour against, and earnestly beg Grace of God to overcome. The Exhortation is, <HI>My son, faint not when thou art rebuked of him,</HI> Heb. 12.5. But then not to be con∣cerned, not to grieve, not to be humbled under Affliction, is to be condemned, <HI>My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,</HI> forequoted, Heb. 12.5. When God is cor∣recting to say, I do not regard it, Let God take all, if he will; If my Estate must go, let it go; If my Children die, let them die; this is <HI>to despise the Chastening of the

Lord;</HI> and God cannot bear it, that we should bear it thus lightly. The Contempt of God's Judgments are very displeasing and provoking to him. To see Men merry and jocund, when God is angry, or to set light by his Corrections. Isai. 22.12, 13, 14. <HI>And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to boldness, and to girding with sackcloth; and behold joy and gladness, slaying Oxen, and killing Sheep eat-flesh, and drinking wine; Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of hosts, surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you, till ye die saith the Lord God of hosts.</HI> Surely, the displeasure of God in Afflictions and Judg∣ments, ought to be laid to Heart. Is it a small matter to have God's frowns and dis∣pleasure? Amos 3.6. <HI>Shall a trumpet be blown in the City, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a City and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> was a suitor for his sister <HI>Miriam,</HI> he received this Answer from the Lord, Numb. 12.24. <HI>If her father had pit in her face, should she not have been asha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed seven days?</HI> The face is the Table and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eat of beauty and honour; but when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it upon it is made the sink of Shame. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad her own Father spit upon her Face,
<PB N="6" REF="002545_0007_0FDB4CF8A9A4E768"/>
when she had displeased him, would she not have gone aside as one ashamed by such a Rebuke, &amp; not have shewed her face to him again in seven Days? How much more should she take it to heart and be sensible of this Rebuke of mine, who have filled her face with leprous Spots, the signs of my displea∣sure against her? Surely God will be asha∣med of those, that are not ashamed nor humbled, when he rebukes them. It is not Magnanimity, but Stupidity to make light of God's Corrections. And for this the af∣flicted are smartly taxed, Jer. 5.3. <HI>Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou haste smitten them, but they have refused to receive Correction.</HI> (2.) <HI>Job</HI> Worshipped. His heavy Afflictions did not make him cease from praying to God and worshipping. 'Tis very sad when they do so. Let us care∣fully see to it, that our Afflictions how sad∣ly circumstanced, or aggravated soever they be, don't drive us from Prayer. Affliction is a praying season, Prayer is a Duty never out of season, but never more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than in and under Affliction.

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> GOD's Children and People have no reason to murmur and complain of him, under the Bereavemnts with which he afflicts them; but contrary-wise great Reason to bless his Name.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two Propositions contained in the Doctrine. [1.] That God's Children and People have no Reason to complain of him under their Bereavements. [2.] That they have great Reason under their Bereave∣ments to bless his Name.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>GOD's Children and People have no Reason to murmur and complain of him under their Bereavements, with which he is af∣flicting them.</HI> Two Things I will instance in here to illustrate this Truth. [1.] They have no Reason to complain, because of their Sins which they have been guilty of. [2.] Be∣cause God reserved the supreme Dominion and Disposal of what was given in his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ands.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, <HI>GOD's Children have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to complain of him under afflicting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ments, because of their Sins.</HI> Lam. 3.39 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>sore doth a living man complain, a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

punishment of his Sins.</HI> We are Sinners, and Afflictions are our Wages, our Due, and there is no reasonable Man, that will repine at just and equal Dealing. One great Reason which makes Men apt to complain, that <HI>God's ways are unequal,</HI> is because they don't consider that <HI>their own are so.</HI> In the Place but just now cited, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.39. where the Prophet disswades from murmuring and re∣pining, he doth in the very next Verse ex∣hort to Self-Examination; <HI>Let us search and try our ways;</HI> implying, that he who rightly understands his own Sinfulness will find little Reason to repine at Sufferings. Every Sin is a great Wrong to God. Sin is an hor∣rible injury unto God. Sin is Rebellion a∣gainst God. Sinning is the casting off the Yoke of God. Sinning is an Insurrection of the Soul against God. In Sin there is also great Contempt cast upon God. Sin is a vi∣lifying and slighting of God. Sin is also Enmity against him: In all Obedience there is Love, in all Disobedience there is Hatred. Sinners strike at God, when they sin. Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly considers thus the Evil of Sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s justify God under the Evils he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d instead of entertaining hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of God, as if he dealt too severe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, Say as in Psal. 103.10. <HI>He
<PB N="10" REF="002545_0011_0FDB46B835CA6A90"/>
hath not dealt with us after our Sins, nor re∣warded us according to our Iniquities.</HI> And with the Church, in Lam. 3.22. <HI>Its of the Lord's mercies that we are not c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsumed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD's Children and People have no Rea∣son to complain under afflictive Bereavements, because God reserves the supreme Dominion and Disposal of what was given in his own Hands.</HI> We read in general, that <HI>the Earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof,</HI> Psal. 24.1. And more particularly in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.4. God there challengeth a right in all Persons. <HI>All Souls</HI> (saith he) <HI>are mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine.</HI> He has made all Things and from thence, has an unalterable right in them, and Domini∣on over them. He does not give away his right, when he gives Men the Comforts of this Life, nor does he make them absolute Lords of them; but rather lends them, and allows them the Use and Comfort of them, during his good Pleasure. Hence when he takes them away, he takes but his own. Takes that which was lent; and shall we complain of this? 'Tis ingratitude to com∣plain of that as an Injury, which is but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Restitution of what was freely lent. Since God's Dominion is absolute, his Disposals should be acceptable to us. It was so to

good <HI>Eli,</HI> Sam. 3.18. <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</HI> And it was so to <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 39.9. <HI>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</HI> And so it was to holy <HI>Job, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> We pass now to the second Pro∣position contained in the Doctrine, viz.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THAT God's Children and Peo∣ple have great Reason to bless his Name un∣der all their afflictive Bereavements.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THEY have Reason to bless God for Af∣flictions themselves:</HI> Since they are design∣ed for their Benefit, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.10. And shall promote it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28. These Benefits may be considered under three Heads. [1.] Those that respect Sin. [2.] Those that respect the opposites of it, Grace and Holiness. [3.] Those that regard Com∣fort and Joy.</P>
<P N="1">[1.] <HI>AS to Sin:</HI> Afflictions are serviceable to discover it, and give us a sense of it. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by that great Sufferer, <HI>Job, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in fetters, and be holden in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, then sheweth them their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir transgression that they have</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 36.8, 9. Afflictions open these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had shut, and remind them
<PB N="12" REF="002545_0013_0FDB4CF74757BAF0"/>
of their Follies, and causes them to reflect on them with remorse and repentance. <HI>Art thou come to call my sins to remembrance?</HI> said the sorrowful <HI>Widow</HI> to the <HI>Prophet,</HI> under the doleful Apprehension of her Child's Death, 1 Kings 17.18. Now when her hopeful Son was taken away, she remem∣bred her too great Fondness and Indulgence towards him, or the bad Example she gave him, or she reflects on some other Delin∣quencies, and is deeply touched with a sense of them. Again,</P>
<P>THE Afflictions of this Life are not only serviceable to discover Sins past, but to hin∣der the commission of them for the Future. <HI>Before I was afflicted</HI> (saith the Psalmist) <HI>I went astray,</HI> Psal. 119.67. God's Children and People are sometimes wandring, going astray; but Providence arrests them by some signal Calamity and Distress, and brings them back again. <HI>By this</HI> (saith the Pro∣phet, i. e. by this severe Chastisement) <HI>shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sins,</HI> Isai. 27.9. And it is fruit enough, it is ample and large Success. God is our good Physician; Af∣fliction is the Medicine he prescribes and prepares for us; it's bitter indeed, but wholsome, for it is useful to purge the De∣pravity
<PB N="13" REF="002545_0014_0FDB46A8B04CDE40"/>
of our Nature, and the Visiosity of our Manners.</P>
<P N="2">[2.] <HI>AS to Grace and Holiness.</HI> Afflictions are very serviceable to increase Grace. Affliction <HI>yields the peaceable fruits of righte∣ousness, unto them which are exercised thereby.</HI> This fruit is various and manifold, which may be seen briefly in these ensuing Parti∣culars.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>THE genuine Effect of Affliction is Faith in God. I have heard of thee</HI> (saith <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b</HI>) <HI>by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee,</HI> Chap. 42.5. In Trouble and Distress, the Eye of Faith is opened and cleared, so that the Man is able to behold those Things which he could not discern by the Eye of Sense and common Apprehension. Now God's People arrive to a firm and stea∣dy Belief of the Promises. We now em∣brace them when we stand in need of them. We confide in Jesus the Author of them, and rest our Souls upon him, as our only sup∣port. When all outward Enjoyments are with-drawn, then by Faith we take a pros∣pect of Heaven and Happiness, and those eternal <HI>Pleasures which are at God's right hand.</HI> This we see in <HI>David,</HI> he was taught to fly unto God, and trust in him, in the Day of Distress and Calamity, and never
<PB N="14" REF="002545_0015_0FDB4CF5D99587B0"/>
did his humble Confidence rise to the high∣est Pitch, till he was brought low, &amp; worn out with Trouble and Misery; as we may observe in his excellent Psalms.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>REPENTANCE is another fruit of that Righteousness, which is the product of Affliction.</HI> Therefore we may observe, that it immedi∣ately follows in that above-cited Chapter of <HI>Job,</HI> ver. 6. <HI>I abbor my self and repent in dust and ashes.</HI> With Faith is joined true Repentance, and both are the blessed fruits of sanctified Troubles. When <HI>Manasseh</HI> was in Fetters and Chains, then he humbled himself for his Idolatry, and other gross Offences, and turned unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>A Spirit of Prayer and Supplication is another fruit of Affliction.</HI> Isai. 26.9. <HI>With my spirit within me, will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inha∣bitants of the world will learn righteousness.</HI> Hos. 5.15. <HI>In their affliction they will seek me early.</HI> Psal. 130.1, 2. <HI>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord!

see in holy David, Psal. 116.3, &amp;c. <HI>The sor∣rows of death compassed me, the pains of hell gat hold upon me, I found trouble &amp; sorrow: Then called I upon the name of the Lord, O Lord I beseech thee deliver my soul.</HI> And those of his Psalms which are most expressive of his devotion, and composed of earnest petitions and supplications, were indited when he was in great trouble and distress. It's this adverse and afflictive state, that hath extorted prayer from the most profligate Sinners. Particularly it is recorded of <HI>Manasseh,</HI> that when he was <HI>among the thorns, and bound in fetters, he besought the Lord his God, and prayed unto him,</HI> 2 Chron. 33.11, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>THE next Grace which Affliction is very serviceable to promote, is Humility.</HI> It's the wise design of Providence to exercise Men with Afflictions, that they may learn not to be proud and presumptuous. <HI>David</HI> said in his <HI>prosperity, I shall never be moved,</HI> Psal. 30.6. which is the language of pride and self confidence: but it follows, <HI>Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.</HI> His prosperous state was changed into another of a quite different nature: which was very well for him, to check the growing Insolence of his spirit. It is particularly, recorded of <HI>Manasseh</HI> whom I mentioned before, that
<PB N="16" REF="002545_0017_0FDB46B6CED8EB28"/>
<HI>when he was in affliction, he humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</HI> 2 Chron. 33.12.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>HEAVENLY MINDEDNESS is great∣ly promoted by Afflictions.</HI> These make us pant after a better state: these make us cry out with the Psalmist, <HI>Wo is me, that I soj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn in Mesech,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>O that I had the wings of a dove, that I might flee away, and be at rest! Whom have I in heaven but thee.</HI> And Afflicti∣on doth this, by convincing us o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Worlds vanity, emptiness and uncertainty.</P>
<P N="3">[3dly,] and lastly. ANOTHER Spiritual advantage which attends Affliction when sanctified, is <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and Comfort.</HI> As the Suf∣ferings of Christ abound in us, says the A∣postle <HI>Paul,</HI> so <HI>our Consolation aboundeth by Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.5. God hath Comforts for his People, which far transcend the comfort of Children, or any other outward Enjoy∣ment. These some have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, when their Children have been cut off from them, and that in so eminent a degree, that they have little valued their comfort in Children, in comparison of this Comfort. I have read of an holy Man, who one day after a sharp Tryal, having his only Son suddenly taken away by Death, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed alone for several hours; and when he came forth did look
<PB N="17" REF="002545_0018_0FDB46505FC1A380"/>
so chearfully, that to those who asked him the reason thereof, and wondred at the same in such a Time; he told them, <HI>He had got that in his Retirement with the Lord, that t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have it afterward renewed, he would be con∣tent to lose a Son every day.</HI> Oh what a sweet exchange had he made! Surely he had Gold for Brass, a Pearl for a Pebble; a Treasure for a Trifle; for so great, yea and far greater is the disproportion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etwixt the sweet light of God's Countenance, and the faint dim light of the best Creature Enj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yments.</P>
<P>THESE now are some of the precious Be∣nefits of sanctified Afflictions, of sanctified Bereavements, and therefore God's People should bless him even for them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY have reason to bless God under afflictive Bereavements for the Mercies they yet enjoy.</HI> Holy <HI>Job</HI> notwithstanding his great A∣fflictions, yet blesses God, because of remaining Mercies. The setting of some Comforts did not cloud and be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight all the rest, as too often it does. No, he sees what was left, and blesses God for them. Let the afflict∣ed, bereaved Christian go and do likewise. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u have lost Children, well but still you have a Wife, a Husband, and other Chil∣dren; bless God for them, Health of Body, an Estate remaining, an Habitation and Re∣putation
<PB N="18" REF="002545_0019_0FDB4542B4DD2C30"/>
remaining, and Friends to sympa∣thize with you in your sore Affliction, to pity and pray for you; bless God for these, and all other great and undeserved Mercies. 'Tis highly reasonable you should so do. To despise and slight all our other Mercies and Enjoyments because we have lost some, is vile Ingratitude, and the way to lose all.</P>
<P>USE and IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P>AND now, Let what has been said be di∣rected to <HI>afflicted bereaved ones.</HI> Particular∣ly to our Christian Friends here among us, who are mourning for the Loss of their dear Children, and ready to say as in <HI>Job</HI> 29.2, 5. <HI>O that I were us in months past, when my Children were about me.</HI> Your Trial is is indeed very sharp, your Afflictions very sore and sad, and demands the pity of your Friends, <HI>Have pity, have pity upon we, O ye my friends for the hand of God hath touched me,</HI> so cries <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 19.21. We are come to mourn with you, to pity and pray for you, and would willingly afford you all the help we can to enable you both to bear it and improve it aright. You must bear it with Silence and Submission. <HI>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have born chastise∣ment, I will not offend any more.</HI> He is the

sovereign Lord of all, and may do with us and ours as he pleaseth. <HI>The Lord gave,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Job</HI> acknowledgeth God in all. And after all, this is it (dear Friends) that must satisfy you under this sad Providence, <HI>That the Lord hath done it;</HI> and the same Will that or∣dered the Thing it self, ordered all the Circumstances of it; and who are we that we should dispute with our Maker: <HI>Let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of the earth, but let not the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?</HI> The supreme Being must needs be an unac∣countable, and uncontroulable Being. It is said, 2 Sam. 3.36. <HI>That whatsoever the King did pleased all the people.</HI> And shall any thing the Lord doth, displease you? He can do no wrong. If we kill a Lamb for our Food, or crop a Flower for our Plea∣sure, we do no wrong, because the original of 'em was for our Use, and they had their Life and Nourishment and pleasing. Quali∣ties for our Support &amp; Delight; and what wrong does God do, who has taken away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear Lambs in their Bloom &amp; Blossom? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for his <HI>Pleasure they are and were cre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd made. It was Mercy that you had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hildren, which now alas! you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that you had so much Comfort in

them so long: It's Mercy that you have one another, and other Children, that they are not all gone. Bless God for these and be not unthankful, that will make way for another, and perhaps sharper Stroke.</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Improvement of this Afflistion,</HI> (which I hope both of you earnestly desire, for it is a great loss to lose such a Provi∣dence, and not be made better by it) there are the following lessons which it should teach you, and they are good lessons, and should be well learned, for the advantage of them is unspeakable.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>IT should forever imbitter sin to you.</HI> You know what she said to the Prophet, 1 Kin. 17.18. <HI>Art thou come to call my sin to remembrance, and to stay my son?</HI> 'Tis Sin, that is the old kill-friend, and the <HI>Jonah</HI> that hath raised this storm, the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han</HI> that hath troubled your house; then how should you grow in your hatred of it, and endea∣vours against it? that you may be the death of that which hath been the death of your Children; I say the death of it, for nothing less will satisfy the true penitent than the death of such a melefactor.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>IT should put an edge upon your Prayers, and all your other holy performances.</HI> Job <HI>fell down,</HI> but it was to <HI>worship.</HI> Let this sore
<PB N="21" REF="002545_0022_0FDB4CF1298764B8"/>
Affliction bring you more than ever upon your Knees. Pour out your Hearts before him, in free, full and broken hearted Con∣fessions of Sin: Judge yourselves worthy of Hell, as well as of this Trouble. Justi∣fy God in all his smartest Strokes, beg him to sanctify it to you, and in this Distress to put under the everlasting Arms. Entreat one smile, one gracious look to enlighten your Darkness.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>YOU must learn by it as long as you live, to keep year Affections in due bounds towards Creature Comforts.</HI> How hard is it to love, and not to overlove, to delight in Children, and not over-delight; now God is a jealous God, and will not give his Glo∣ry to any other; and our Excess this Way doth often provoke him to remove that Mercy from us, which we do thus make an Idol of; and our Duty is to labour when he doth so, to get that matter mended, and to rejoice in all our Enjoyments with trem∣bling, and as if we rejoyced not.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>IT should be a means of drawing your Hearts upwards and Heaven-wards.</HI> You should be looking oftner than before into the other World. <HI>I shall go to him</HI> (saith <HI>David</HI>) when his little Son was gone be∣fore. It is but a little while, 'ere long the
<PB N="22" REF="002545_0023_0FDB44F6F9BF1C90"/>
things of Time shall be swallowed up in Eternity; in the midst of Life, we are in Death: <HI>What manner of Persons ought we to be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>NOW our LORD JESUS CHRIST Himself, and GOD, even our Father,</HI> be your Support under, and do your Souls good by this Dis∣pensation, and sorrowful Stroke, so will you have great Reason <HI>to bless his Name.</HI></P>

<P>THESE Words which I have now read unto you, together with the two preceeding Verses, are a Pre∣face or Introduction to the ac∣count which we have in the following Chap∣ter, of <HI>Christ</HI>'s sending forth his Disciples. <HI>When he saw the multitudes, he was moved with Compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad as Sheep having no Shepherd.

<PB N="24" REF="002545_0025_0FDB459773897758"/>
for the Lord. Mat. 11.12. <HI>From the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven had suffered violence, and the violent took it by force.</HI> Men were fond of hearing the Gos∣pel, the People desired good preaching, <HI>the harvest was plenteous, the fields were white to the harvest,</HI> as our Saviour expresseth it in another place, <HI>John</HI> 4.35. But the misery of it was, <HI>the Labourers were few.</HI> There were few that would faithfully deliver the mind of God; there were abundance of idle <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and <HI>Scribes,</HI> and <HI>Priests,</HI> that spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t their Time in teaching People their <HI>Rites,</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and <HI>Traditions;</HI> but they fainted for all this. For what spiri∣tual Health, and Life, and Vigour can there be in those Souls, that are fed with Husks and Ashes, instead of the <HI>Bread of Life. They were scattered abroad as Sheep having no Shepherd.</HI> The Expression is (as one observes) borrowed from 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22.17. And sets forth the sad Condition of those who are destitute of faithful Guides to go before them in the things of God. No Creature more apt to stray than a Sheep, &amp; when gone astray, more helpless, shiftless, and expos∣ed; nor more unapt to find the way home again: Sinful Souls are as <HI>lost Sheep,</HI> they need the <HI>Care of Shepherds</HI> to bring them
<PB N="25" REF="002545_0026_0FDB451E0C6FEA08"/>
back. The Teachers of the <HI>Jews</HI> had pre∣tended to be Shepherds, yet Christ saith, they had no Shepherds: For they were worse than none, idol Shepherds, that led them away instead of reducing them, and fleec'd the Flock instead of feeding it. This moved the Bowels of Christ, his Heart yearned towards the People, when he saw the lamentable Condition they were in. And for the remedying it, he puts his Dis∣ciples on to pray for them. <HI>Pray ye there∣fore the Lord of the Harvest, that he will send forth Labourers into is Harvest.</HI></P>
<P>THE Direction which Christ here gives to his Disciples, is a standing direction to others. So that the <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be insisted upon from the Words is this.</P>

<P>THIS <HI>Doctrine</HI> may be spoken to, under the following <HI>Heads</HI> or <HI>Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sitions.</HI></P>
<P>1. THAT GOD is the LORD of the Har∣vest. 2. That faithful Ministers are, and all should be Labourers in GOD's Harvest. 3. It is GOD's Work to send forth Labour∣ers into his Harvest. 4. And lastly, It is a
<PB N="26" REF="002545_0027_0FDB46C742D985D0"/>
Christian People's Duty to pray to the LORD of the Harvest to send forth Labour∣ers into his Harvest. I shall speak to these Heads in their Order.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>GOD is the LORD of the Harvest. My Father</HI> (says Christ) <HI>is the Husbandman,</HI> Joh. 15.1. He orders every thing concerning the Harvest as he pleases. When the La∣bourers shall work, and where, and how long they shall continue so to do. And as 'tis for him, and to him, his Service and Honour, that the Harvest is gathered in, so it is from him. <HI>Ye are God's Husbandry, ye are God's Building,</HI> says the Apostle, speak∣ing to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> See 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.9. Their Conversion and Edification was from God. Ministers indeed are dignified with the Title of <HI>Labourers together with God,</HI> as in the forequoted place. And of <HI>Co-work∣ers with God,</HI> 2 Cor. 10.4. But they, even the best and brightest of them are nothing, neither can they do any Thing without God. <HI>I have planted</HI> (says the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> 1 Cor. 3.6, 7.) <HI>Apollos watered: bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God that giveth the increase.</HI> God ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> me (says the Apostle) to preach the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> among you, and blessed my preach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> convert you to Christ, then I left you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>los</HI> staid behind, and he watered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="27" REF="002545_0028_0FDB464CF0B661F8"/>
planted, daily preaching among you. He further was a means to build you up in faith and holiness, but God increased, or gave the increase; God gave the power by which they brought forth fruit. The similitude is drawn from Planters, either Husdandmen or Gardiners, they plant, they water, but the growing, the budding, the bringing forth flowers, or fruit by the plant, doth much more depend upon the Soil in which it stands, the influence of Heaven upon it, the beams of the Sun, and the drops of the Dew and Rain, and the internal vertue, which the God of nature hath created in the plant, than upon the hand of him, that planteth, or him who useth his watering-pot to water it. So it is with Souls, one Minister is used for Conversion, or the first changing of Souls; another is used for Edification or further building up of Souls; but both Conversion and Edification are infinitely more from the New Heart &amp; New Nature, which God giveth to the Soul from the influence of the Sun of Righteousness by the Spirit of Grace, working in and upon the Soul, than from any Minister, who is God's Instrument in those Works. So that look as it is in earthly Plantations, God hath the greatest influence upon the growth
<PB N="28" REF="002545_0029_0FDB46A4AF0575D8"/>
and fruitfulness of the Plant, and the Hus∣bandman or Gardiner is nothing in Com∣parison of God, who hath given to the Plant planted its life and nature, by which it shooteth up, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deth and bringeth forth fruit, and maketh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Sun to shine, and his Rain to fall upon it. So it is in the Spiri∣tual Plantation, God is the principal efficient Cause, we are little instrumental causes in his hand▪ nothing in comparison with God. If we see a Soul changed, or grow, or make any spiritual proficiency, we must say, <HI>Nor unto us, O Lord! not unto us, but unto thy Name be given the glory.</HI> God hath done the main work, we have done nothing in comparison of Him.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THAT faithful Ministers are, and all should be Labourers in GOD's Harvest.</HI> The Ministry is a Work, and must be at∣tended to accordingly. 'Tis Harvest Work, which requires Diligence to do it through∣ly. The Office of the Ministry, however easy it may be looked upon, by those that are ignorant of the nature of it, and the duty required in it, is painful &amp; laboriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> For the clearing up of this <HI>Proposition</HI> let it be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT the Appellations and Titles given to the Ministers of the Gospel, shews that their
<PB N="29" REF="002545_0030_0FDB45E6F5833800"/>
Work is attended with Labour.</HI> They are cal∣led <HI>Ministers, Pastors,</HI> &amp; <HI>Shepherds, Bishops</HI> and <HI>Overseers, Stewards, Builders</HI> &amp; <HI>Planters, Soldiers, Watchmen</HI> &amp; <HI>Rulers,</HI> all which Titles bespeak Service, Care, Watchfulness and Diligence.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT will appear that the Ministerial Work is a painful and difficult Work, if we consider what the Work of the Ministry is.</HI> And here,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>A principal Work belonging to a Minis∣ter of the Gospel is to feed the Flock by diligent preaching of the Word.</HI> It's a Promise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elat∣ing to the New-Testament, that God would give unto his Church <HI>Pastors according to his own heart which should feed them with know∣ledge and understanding.</HI> This is done by preaching the Word. The Care of preaching the Word was committed to <HI>Peter,</HI> and in him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o all the Pastors of the Church under the name of feeding. Joh. 21.15, 16. <HI>Feed my Lambs, feed my Sheep.</HI> Now this is a Work attended with Labour, and Pains, when per∣formed as it ought to be. There is much con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that apostolical Charge and In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 2 Tim. 4.2. <HI>Preach the word, be in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> season, and out of season, reprove, re∣buke, exhort with all long-suffering &amp; doctrine.</HI> The Lord said to the Prophet, <HI>Cry aloud, spare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, lift up thy voice like a trumpet.</HI> It con∣demns
<PB N="30" REF="002545_0031_0FDB466EB6FA99A8"/>
a cold, dull, lifeless way of preach¦ing. Ministers are enjoined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to labour to the utmost of their Strength they have therein. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. It's required of Minis∣ters, that they instruct the People in the <HI>whole counsel of God,</HI> &amp; that <HI>they keep back</HI> nothing that is profitable to them. See <HI>Acts</HI> 20. As <HI>good Stewards they are to give every one their portion in due season,</HI> to give unto all Persons belonging to their Charge what is profitable, proper and seasonable, as their spiritual States and Occasions do require. Now a little or common measure of Knowledge in the Truths of the Gospel will not be suffi∣cient to these Ends. No, an eminency of divine Knowledge and substantial Learning is required. Hence they must as the Apostle exhorts <HI>Timothy,</HI> in 1 Tim. 4.15. <HI>Give atten∣dance to reading,—Meditate upon these things, give themselves wholly to them, that their pro∣fiting may appear to all.</HI> They must <HI>study to shew themselves approved unto God, workmen that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.15. <HI>To search the Scrip∣tures</HI> is every Christians Duty, <HI>Job.</HI> 5.39. But it is the Ministers Duty in a special and peculiar Manner, whose Office it is to open and apply them. Search them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Word is metaphorical taken from such
<PB N="31" REF="002545_0032_0FDB45B9060BDDE8"/>
as use to search into Mines for Silver and Gold. There are rich Mines in the Scripture, there is what is better than Gold in those Mines, but Ministers must dig deep, (a Work of Labour) that they may come at the Trea∣sure. The Labours of a Minister in his Pulpit is great, &amp; so are his Labours in his Study, and Preparations for the Pulpit. The Labour of the Head &amp; Heart is most tiresome; therefore the wise Man says, <HI>Much study is a weariness of the flesh,</HI> Eccl. 12.12.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>ANOTHER Part of a Ministers Work is to rule and govern the Church.</HI> Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that rule over you in the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. Their Power is not secular, but spiritual, their Authority is not legislative, but exe∣cutive. They are to govern not by their own Will &amp; Humour, but by the Laws of Christ, according to the Orders he hath appointed for the Edification of the Church, and the Preservation of it, in Purity, Holiness, and Obedience. This also is a laborious Work. All kind of Government is burdensome. The Government of the Church is so in a pecu∣liar Manner, Heb. 12.15. <HI>Looking diligently lest any Man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and so many be defiled.</HI> Rev. 2.2. <HI>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou
<PB N="32" REF="002545_0033_0FDB45B7D6F66718"/>
canst not bear them that are evil.</HI> The Rule which lies on the Pastors of the Churches calls for a great Measure of Wisdom &amp; Know∣ledge. Mat. 24.25. <HI>Who is that faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his houshold to give them their meat in due season.</HI> There is great need of Labour and Diligent study to prepare themselves, for this Part of their Work, that they may know how to behave themselves in <HI>the Church of the living God,</HI> which is the Pillar &amp; Ground of Truth. To manage aright the many diffi∣cult, thorny &amp; perplexing Cases that will come before them, is a Work of Pains and Difficulty.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>ANOTHER Part of a Minister's Work lies in making pastoral Visits to the Families of his Flock, to know their State, and to instruct, advise, admonish &amp; comfort, as their is Occasion. Paul</HI> taught <HI>publickly and from house to house.</HI> Especially it is a Duty incumbent upon them to visit the Sick, to pray with them, &amp; to help them to prepare either for a fruitful Life, or an happy Death.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>IT is the Duty of Ministers to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Children of the Flock, &amp; in that way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them the first Principles of the Oracle of God.</HI> O∣ther Instances of their Work, might be men∣tioned, but these may suffice to show, that the Ministry is truly a laborious Work.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="33" REF="002545_0034_0FDB466DDAC77800"/>3. <HI>IT must be shown, that the Work of Gospel Ministers is a laborious Work, from the Oppo∣sitions which they meet withal.</HI> The Work of the Ministry has a direct Tendency to the subversion and demolishing of Satan's King∣dom; hence the Devil bears Christ's faith∣ful Ministers the greatest Malice, who are engaged to do him the greatest Damage, and he will be improving to the utmost his Poli∣cy and Power to molest Christ's faithful La∣bourers &amp; obstruct them in their Work. Hell and Earth too are joined in a cursed Combina∣tion to ruin their Work, &amp; what Pains, Courage and Resolution is eno' to vanquish this Oppo∣sition, &amp; carry on the desired Work to Success? Sure, the Work will be left undone, unless God's Servants are patient, unwearied in their Labours.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>THAT it is GOD's Work to send forth Labourers into his Harvest.</HI> Christ makes Ministers. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Office is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his appointing.</HI> Jesus Christ the Head &amp; King of his Church hath ordained▪ &amp; set therein (besides the Apostles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinary Officers that are now ceas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>&amp; Teachers.</HI> These are enumerat∣ed in the List or Catalogue of those Church-Officers which are of divine Institution. God set (or put, or constituted) some in the Church,
<PB N="34" REF="002545_0035_0FDB450F78A4D2F0"/>
first <HI>Apostles,</HI> secondarily <HI>Prophets,</HI> thirdly <HI>Teachers,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.20. Those are some of the Triumphant Gifts &amp; Trophies of Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st's Ascension, <HI>Ascending up on high, he led Capti∣vity Captive, &amp; gave gifts to men —&amp; he gave some Apostles, &amp; some Prophets, &amp; some Evan∣gelists, &amp; some Pastors &amp; Teachers,</HI> Eph. 1.8.11. The Apostles &amp; Evangelists ordaining Pastors and Teachers; (called also Presbyters &amp; El∣ders,) the Qualifications of such laid down in the Scripture; the Duties incumbent upon them; the Names &amp; Titles given to them; the Charge which Christ gives their Flocks and People to know them, love them, obey them, submit unto them, honour them, main∣tain them; do all proclaim, that they are His O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinance. Thus Christ hath instituted the Office of the Ministry.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>MINISTERIAL Gifts &amp; Qualifications are of God's Working.</HI> Jam. 1.17. <HI>Every good gift &amp; every perfect gift is from above, &amp; cometh down from the father of lights.</HI> The Graces of <HI>Sanctification</HI> proceed from the Spirit of Christ, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.22. and so do the Graces of <HI>Edification,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.7. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. The Holy Spirit of Grace is poured out on the Church for that end, to furnish some for the Edification of others, and by their Ministry
<PB N="35" REF="002545_0036_0FDB46E776965D80"/>
to bring in the Elect to believe &amp; be saved. Christ the Head of all glorious Influences Qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied &amp; furnished the Apostles for their Service, and so he does ordinary Ministers for theirs to the Worlds end. Only it must be here remembred, that we look not to receive Gifts by immediate infusion, as in the infancy of the Church. That Manna was only for the Wilderness, when other common ways could not be made use of: But now the Church is grown up to the estate of manhood, and is possessed of the Land, God does now expect that we should plow, and eat the fruit of the Earth in the sweat of our brows. Gifts for the Ministry are to be ex∣pected in the use of ordinary Means, Study, Industry, Meditation and Prayer.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>AN Inclination of Heart to the Work of the Minstry is from God also.</HI> There is a varie∣ty of Callings among Men, and God (who has the Hearts of all Men in his Hands, &amp; can turn them as the Rivers of Water are turned) does in infinite Wisdom &amp; Goodness various∣ly incline and dispose them, some to one Cal∣ling &amp; Course of Life, &amp; some to another; and some to the Sacred Calling of the Ministry. Besides Gifts &amp; Abilities for this holy Service, there is requisite an Inclination of Will, to use them therein. 1 Pet.2.5. <HI>Feed the Flock of
<PB N="36" REF="002545_0037_0FDB464B806C4E90"/>
God which is among you, taking tbe oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly.</HI> Accord∣ingly God spirits some for this Work. They are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon them the Office of serving in the sacred Ministry of the Church. Not but Persons upon a due Meditation of the greatness of the Work, &amp; the many Difficulties which attend it, and from an humble Sense of their Weakness, may for some time find a Reluc∣tancy in their own Hearts thereto, and be ready to say as <HI>Moses, Send I pray thee by the hand of him, whom thou wilt send,</HI> Exod. 4.13. And with the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> Jer. 1.6. <HI>Ah, Lord God, behold I cannot speak, for I am a Child.</HI> And with the Apostle, 2 Cor. 2.16. <HI>Who is suf∣ficient for these things.</HI> But God overcomes their unwillingness, and thrusts them forth. He strengthens them against Discourage∣ments, and gives Courage and Resolution to enter upon this work. <HI>Thou art stronger than I</HI> (says the Prophet) <HI>&amp; hast prevailed,</HI> Jer. 20.7:</P>
<P N="4">4thly, &amp; lastly, <HI>IT is Christ who invests Men with Ministerial Power &amp; Authority.</HI> This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> does not immediately by himself, but by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Choice &amp; Election of a Christian Church &amp; P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ple, with solemn Separation by Imposition of Hands and Prayer, to which Fasting is to be joined. Act. 14.23. <HI>And when they had ordained
<PB N="37" REF="002545_0038_0FDB454F9EB47558"/>
them Elders in every Church, and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.</HI> I Tim. 4.14. <HI>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by pro∣phecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Pres∣bytery.</HI> Let mens gifts and graces be never so admirable, they ought not to take this honour to themselves, until set apart therefor, and as well impowred to the work of the Ministry by an outward Mission, as enabled to it, by their gifts &amp; qualifications. But thus for the Third Proposition; So God sends forth Labourers into his Harvest.</P>
<P>PROP. IV. and Last. <HI>THAT it is a Christian Peoples Duty, to pray to the Lord of the Harvest, to send forth Labourers into his Harvest.</HI> Our Obligation to this Duty is evident,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>FROM Scripture Precepts.</HI> The Text is a plain rule &amp; standing Law to us in this case. And when our Saviour was pleased to leave us a directory for Prayer, one of the first petitions in it is, <HI>Thy Kingdom come.</HI> Under which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etition various things lie couched, and this among others, that God would send forth, more, skilful, faithful, wise, industrious Labourers into his Harvest. That he would raise up such as he will own in the Conversion of Sinners, &amp; the Edification of Saints, would spirit them for the work, call them to it, and succeed them in it. Again,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="38" REF="002545_0039_0FDB4CEE498564A8"/>2. Consider, <HI>GOD promises this mercy unto his Church.</HI> Jer. 3.15. <HI>I will give you Pastors ac∣cording to mine own heart, which shall feed you with knowledge, &amp; understanding.</HI> This is an ob∣ligation as well as an encouragement to Pray∣er. What God promises, that he would have us pray for. Ezek. 36.37. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, I will yet for this be enquired for, by the house of Is∣rael to do it for them.</HI> God had often repeated his promise to his people to return them from captivity, to re-build, &amp; multiply them, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays God, they shall know 'tis their duty to entreat it, to wait on me, and then I will give a merciful answer, and do it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Glory &amp; Honour of God our Saviour call for this Duty from us.</HI> God is greatly glorified in the Churches prosperity. <HI>Hal∣lowed be thy Name, the Kingdom come.</HI> Now faithful &amp; laborious Ministers are means and instruments in God's Hands of advancing his Kingdom &amp; Interest in the World, and so his honour &amp; glory. Besides, when Men behold such burning &amp; shining lights, and observe their gifts, graces, &amp; labours, and holy Conver∣sations, they will be ready to magni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord, who has given such Grace to Me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>your light so shine before men</HI> (says our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his Disciples) <HI>that they may see your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> works, &amp; glorify your father which is in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="39" REF="002545_0040_0FDB44E831AD58A0"/>
Mat. 5.16. Since it is then for the honour of God, that Labourers be sent into his Harvest, therefore should we pray, that it might be so.</P>
<P N="4">4 &amp; lastly, <HI>THE Salvation of the precious and immortal Souls of men calls for this Duty.</HI> The Corn will shed &amp; spoil, and rot upon the ground, if Labourers be wanting; but if they are thrust out, there is likelihood then, that the Harvest will be gathered in. If faithful Ministers are wanting in the Church, there is just grounds to fear, that multitudes of Souls will perish eternally. But if God raises up wise &amp; faithful Ministers, and sends them forth, 'tis a hopeful sign, that Sinners will be thereby converted, &amp; Saints edified, and built up in knowledge, faith &amp; holiness unto Salvation. Out of tender compassion then to the Souls of men, we should pray the Lord of the Harvest, to send forth Labourers into his Harvest. Thus for the <HI>Propositions</HI> under the Doctrine; we proceed now to the <HI>Use and Improvement</HI> of them.</P>
<P>USE. I. IS God the Lord of the Harvest, <HI>This then may direct both Ministers &amp; People to Whom to look for fruit.</HI> Ministers in their Pre∣parations for the Pulpit must study such truths, as are most proper &amp; suitable to work upon the hearts &amp; consciences of men, study with the royal Preacher to <HI>find out acceptable

words;</HI> Eccl. 12.10. But they must not depos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon their most elaborate Sermons, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, 'tis a thousand to one, but they find them∣selves disappointed. Neither must a People rely on the Gifts &amp; Abilities of their Ministers how great soever they be; but both must de∣pend upon God, &amp; seek to him by Prayer and Supplication for success, for 'tis God only that can give it. And the more there is this way attributed unto Grace, the more is the Grace of God like to be communicated. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT has been said under the First Proposition, <HI>may teach such as have received benefit by the Labourers in the Harvest to Whom to ascribe praise &amp; glory.</HI> Have you been Con∣verted &amp; Edified by the Ministry of the Word Give God all the Glory. Don't set the crown upon the head of Instruments, but upon the head of Christ. Ministers say in this case <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto God be glory.</HI> They are no more than Instruments, 'tis God who is the efficient of all spiritual saving good. You are God's Husbandry. To God only then must you abscribe Praise.</P>
<P N="2">2. IS the Ministry a Laborious Office. (1.) <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch of us then as have entred upon it, discharge it with all diligence.</HI> We should take heed unto the Ministry, which we have received of the Lord, that we fulfil it. Let us very gladly
<PB N="41" REF="002545_0042_0FDB44D0F59B4058"/>
spend &amp; be spent in this work. Not counting our lives dear unto us, so that we may finish our course with joy, and the Ministry which we have received of the Lord Jesus Christ, to testify the Gospel of the Grace of God. Har∣vest-work is painful work, but it is pleasant work; they reap in joy; and the joy of the Preachers of the Gospel, is like the joy of Harvest. Isai. 9.22. <HI>And he that reapeth reciev∣eth wages.</HI> The hire of the Laboures that re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p down God's field, shall not be kept back, as theirs was, <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.4. No, in due season we shall reap, if we saint not. I might have said,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>THAT faithful Ministers ought honoura∣bly to be suspected by their People.</HI> They are Labourers, &amp; our Saviour has said, Luk. 10.7. <HI>That the labourer is worthy of his hire.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IS it God's Work to send forth Labourers into his Harvest, <HI>A People then that are favoured with such, may be hereby directed Whom to bless and praise.</HI> We of this Land have been, &amp; yet are, exalted in this regard above most other People in the World. How many faithful Wit∣nesses have we had, &amp; have we yet, which have testified unto us, the Gospel of the Grace of God? How many bright Stars shining in our Firmament to give us the knowledge of Sal∣vation from on high, to guide our feet in the way of Peace? Let us look upon them, as the
<PB N="42" REF="002545_0043_0FDB4567CE326258"/>
Ascension-Gifts of our exalted Jesus, fruits of his care, and love to his Church, &amp; bless his holy Name. And let us bless God for the <HI>Col∣lege,</HI> that great School of the Prophets, from whence have issued such Streams, which have made glad the City of God, the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most High.</P>
<P N="4">4. &amp; lastly, IS it our Duty to pray the Lord of the Harvest to send forth Labourers into his Harvest, <HI>Let us then be Exhorted hereunto in our Prayers.</HI> Let us have a Regard to he whole Church of God the World throughout, and pray that God would send more skilful faithful, wise &amp; industrious Labourers into it. Such as he will own in the Conversion of Sin∣ners &amp; the Edification of Saints. Particularly▪ Let us pray that a converted &amp; converting Ministry may be granted to the Churches o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Land from Generation to Generation. More particularly yet, Let the People of this Town pray that God would send forth a Laboure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into this Part of his Harvest, even One of Wis∣dom &amp; Prudence, Courage &amp; Resolution, full of Zeal for the Glory of God &amp; of Compassion to the Souls of Men. You need such an One O cry to God for such a Gift. And here by Way of Direction.</P>
<P><HI>PRAY humbly &amp; penitently for such a Mercy▪</HI> Be deeply sensible of your own unworthines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="43" REF="002545_0044_0FDB4CECAFA92C00"/>
of receiving from God so great a Gift. Ask with true Humiliation; 'tis a Tempter that highly becomes sinful Creatures as we all are. Again,</P>
<P><HI>PUT up your Prayers in the Name of Jesus Christ.</HI> 'Tis Christ who hath purchased such Blessings for his People, and you must plead his Merits and Mediation with God for the bestowment of such an One upon you.</P>
<P>FURTHER, <HI>Pray in Faith.</HI> Know that Christ hath received Gifts to bestow them upon his Church. He Gifts Men to give them to His People. Turn the Promise which God has made of giving Pastors after his own Heart into Petitions, and strengthen your faith therefrom.</P>
<P><HI>ASK with Fervency &amp; Importunity!</HI> This is a Blessing of very great Concernment to the Welfare and Spiritual Prosperity both of you &amp; your Posterity. 'Tis that which if you obtain, will be your crown &amp; glory. I add, your safety. 2 kin. 2.12. <HI>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel, &amp; the Horsemen thereof.</HI> They are the words of <HI>Elisha,</HI> concerning <HI>Elijah,</HI> who did more for the defence and preservation of Israel, than all their Chariots, or other Warlike Provisions. Pious Ministers are a People's Safeguard, as they are God's special Favourites, most nearly related to him, peculiarly beloved, for whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kes he bestows many a been (so to speak) upon the So∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they live among.

<PB N="44" REF="002545_0045_0FDB461BC3295B50"/>
made a remarkable Distinction in New-England, be∣tween those Places that have had Churches gathered, and Pastors settled over them, &amp; those that have been destitute. For in all these Wars wherewith this poor Country hath been almost continually harrass'd and distress'd for above thirty Years past by a barbarous Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, which have broken up many Towns &amp; Plan∣tations, &amp; laid them waste, yet not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of them, where there has been a Church of Christ, an ordained Pastor, have they been able to prevail against. These Churches of Christ being built on a Rock, those Forces &amp; Pow∣ers of Hell have not been able to prevail against them. God hath as it were set there as boundaries to the swelling Rage and Fury of these inhumane Creatures (who broke in upon other Places as a Flood) that hi∣therto they may come and to further; this is the Lord's doing and 'tis marvellous in our Eyes. This is (saith he) worthy of a serious Remark, and ought to be improved to quicken our new Settlements to pro∣cure a Settlement of the Gospel among them; speci∣ally our Frontier Plantations that so they may have God with them. It God hath this Favour for you, as to give you a Pastor after his own Heart, as you may hope on your earnest Prayers &amp; Desires and in the use of regular proper Means, he will; it will not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> conduce to build up your Souls, but your Estates too and will be greatly to your Honour, 'Tis the ready way to advance your temporal Interest, as well as your spiritual &amp; eternal, which is the more valuable.</Q></P>
<P>SINCE then it is so great a Blessing, you should not pray for it coldly, but servently, importunately. So pray and there is Hopes, that you will obtain. God is a God hearing of Prayer. The rewarder of those that diligently seek him. Prayer is the way to win any thing that we need from God. The effectual servent Prayer of a righteous Man availeth much. Such a Gift as we are now speaking of, was always meant to be sought and obtained by Prayer.</P>
