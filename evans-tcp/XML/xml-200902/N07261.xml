<Q><BIBL>1 CHRON. XXIX. 11.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Thine, O</HI> LORD, <HI>is the Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majesty:</HI> for all that is in the Heaven and in the Earth, is thine; thine is the Kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as Head above all.</P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Verse foregoing, we have King David's devout Ascription of Blessing and Praise to the Lord God of <HI>Israel,</HI> for the liberal free-will Offerings of the Princes towards building the Temple: In the Text he declares that this God who was the Object of his Praise, is im∣mensely
<PB N="6" REF="009269_0005_10320D8535241488"/>
great, and incomprehensively glo∣rious. <HI>Thine, O Lord, is the Greatness—</HI> In the Original, it is <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the self-exist∣ing, and eternal God, who has his Being and Perfections in and of himself, indepen∣dently; and is the first Cause, and last End of all Things.</P>
<P>I SHALL consider the Words as they lie in the Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>Greatness is the Lord's.</HI> And that in a singular Manner and transcendent Degree. God is infinite in his Being and all adorable Perfections.<HI>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his Greatness is unsearchable,</HI> Psal. 145.3. The Nations when compar'd with him, are as a Drop of a Bucket, as the small Dust of the Balance: yea all Nations before him are as Nothing, and they are counted to him less than No∣thing and Vanity.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. 40.15,—17.</NOTE> He is immense, and Omnipresent. The divine Essence is above and beyond the Universe of created Beings. The Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens can't contain him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 King. 8.27.</NOTE> He is eternal, and un∣changeable
<PB N="7" REF="009269_0006_10320D86BA475F60"/>
<HI>With him is no Variableness, nor Shadow of Turning.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jam. 1.17.</NOTE> And as to those At∣tributes in which Creatures may resemble him, they are in God original, essential, and without Limits; and so are predicated of him in an appropriate Sense. Agreeably our Lord said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.17. <HI>There is none Good but one, that is God.</HI> And, God is said to be <HI>only wise.</HI> He is in the Abstract Goodness, Wisdom, &amp;c. Accordingly we have that Challenge made to <HI>Job</HI> 11.7—9. <HI>Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection? It is as high as Heaven, what canst thou do? deeper than Hell, what canst thou know? The Measure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</HI> And indeed his Works of Creation, Provi∣dence and Redemption, bear clear Signa∣tures of the divine Greatness. He made <HI>great Lights.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. 1.16.</NOTE> He overthrew the Egypti∣ans in the <HI>Greatness</HI> of <HI>his Excellency.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Exod. 15.7.</NOTE> And in our Redemption by Jesus Christ, he pardons great Transgressions, and bestows on his People <HI>great Salvation;</HI> so that it is said, Heb. 2.3. <HI>How shall we escape, if we</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="009269_0007_10320D888E719DD8"/>
<HI>neglect so great Salvation,</HI> Upon the whole, there's abundant Reason to ascribe <HI>Great∣ness to our God,</HI> Deut. 32.3.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Power is the Lord's.</HI> Psalm. 62, 11. <HI>God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this, that Power belongeth unto God,</HI> Consider Power as it may signify <HI>Authority:</HI> So it belongs to God, and that in a singular Manner. God is the <HI>most High,</HI> over all, God blessed forever. He is the <HI>high and lofty One,</HI> that dwelleth in the high and holy Place, <HI>Isai.</HI> 57.15. As he made all Things, so he has an absolute Right to govern and dispose of them, ac∣cording to his sovereign Will. He is exalt∣ed above all Principalities and Powers, Thrones and Dominions. And is the <HI>bles∣sed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> 1 Tim. 6.15. God is higher than the highest, and his Dominion ruleth over all. He is above his and his People's Enemies, even in those Things wherein they deal most proudly.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Consider Power as it signifieth <HI>Strength,</HI> and Ability to work all Things,
<PB N="9" REF="009269_0008_10320D8A5AD1F398"/>
and in this Sense it belongs to God, and that in a superlative Degree, Dan. 4.35. <HI>And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing: And he doth according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth: And none can stay his Hand, or say unto him, What dost thou?</HI> He works all Things after the Counsel of his own Will;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1.11.</NOTE> his Counsel shall stand, and none can disannul it; this almighty Being made, upholds and governs the World, by the Word of his Power. <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.9. <HI>He spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.</HI> He acts above, yea contrary to the ordinary Course of Nature, in Miracles. In <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Day, at his Command the Sun returned back ten Degrees, by which it was gone down.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. 37.8.</NOTE> When he forbid, the Fire had no Power over the Bodies of <HI>Shadrach, Meshach,</HI> and <HI>Abednego,</HI> tho' the Furnace was heated seven Times.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dan. 3.27.</NOTE> God raiseth the Dead, and calleth the Things that are not as tho' they were. The fallen Angels are called <HI>Powers, Eph.</HI> 6.12. But our Lord
<PB N="10" REF="009269_0009_10320D8C69FEBB80"/>
is stronger than that strong One, and spoils him of his Goods. He gave his Apostles <HI>Power over Devils, Luke</HI> 9.1. And when he pleaseth, he converts Sinners according to the exceeding Greatness of his Power: Turns them from Darkness unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God. And he makes use of frail Men as Instruments in this great Work, that the Excellency of the Power may appear to be of God. And then God maintains the Work of his Grace in them against all Opposition from Earth and Hell, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</HI> In a Word, God is Omnipotent, and there is no Strength can prevail against him. With God all Things are possible, nothing hard or difficult. And this Power is never exhausted, or in the least diminish'd. <HI>Isai.</HI> 40.28, 29. <HI>Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his Understanding. He giveth Power to the faint; and to them that have no Might, he increaseth Strength.</HI> O let us then submit to his Will in all
<PB N="11" REF="009269_0010_10320D8E39314028"/>
Things, acknowledging that he is the Pot∣ter, and we are the Clay. Let us hear and obey that Word, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1. <HI>I am the Al∣mighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</HI> And as this glorious God has given all Power to the Son as Mediator, let us depend on him as able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him. Let us praise him, saying, <HI>Thine is the King∣dom, and the Power and the Glory, forever, Amen.</HI> Matth. 6.13. Which brings me to the third Head of our Discourse.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Glory is the Lord's. <HI>Glory is the Excellency of a Being whereby it is worthy of Praise.</HI> <NOTE N="dragger" PLACE="foot">A worthy Author gives this Description. "Glory is a singular and high Opinion which one conceiveth of the Excellency and Worthiness of another. The He∣brew Word signifieth Weightiness, or Gravity" <HI>Wilson</HI>'s Christ. Dict.</NOTE> Thus <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> were glorious Kings. Thus King David says of the Temple, the House which is to be built for the Lord, must be exceeding magnifical, of Fame and of Glory, through∣out all Countries. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 22.5. But then the glorious Beauty of the Creature is a fading Flower which soon mingleth with the Dust; whereas the glorious Excellen∣cies
<PB N="12" REF="009269_0011_10320D900AA474F0"/>
of God are infinite and eternal, and therefore He alone is worthy to be praised in a, <HI>religious Manner.</HI> We must bow down and worship him, when we ascribe Glory and Praise to his great Name. There's God's <HI>essential Glory,</HI> which is the infinite Fulness and Perfection of his divine Nature. This is ever the same, and can receive no Addition, even from the highest Praises of Angels, <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.5. <HI>And blessed be thy glo∣rious Name, which is exalted above all Blessing and Praise.</HI> God dwells in Light inaccessible and full of Glory. But then, his <HI>declarative Glory</HI> is manifested in his Word and Works. All his <HI>Works praise him,</HI> as they afford Matter and Occasion to intelligent Beings to attend this Duty; and all his <HI>Saints bless him,</HI> and speak of the Glory of his King∣dom, and talk of his Power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 145.10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.1. <HI>The Heavens declare the Glory of God: and the Firmament sheweth his handy Work.</HI> Accordingly we read, that when the Foun∣dations of the Earth were laid, the <HI>Morn∣ing Stars sang</HI> together, and the <HI>Sons of God</HI> shouted for Joy,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job 38.7.</NOTE> i.e. the blessed <HI>Angels</HI> called Morning Stars, "because of their ex∣cellent Lustre." Sons of God, because made
<PB N="13" REF="009269_0012_10320D91D962AC28"/>
in the Image of God their Creator. Thus we must also ascribe to God the Glory of his Works of Providence, and of Redemp∣tion. When the Angels bro't the good Tid∣ings of the Birth of our Saviour, <HI>Christ the Lord,</HI> they praised God saying, <HI>Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth Peace, good Will towards Men.</HI> Luk. 2.14. When <HI>Moses</HI> prayed that God would shew him his Glory, he declares that he could not <HI>see his Face</HI> and live; and that, while his Glory passed by, he would cover him with his Hand, and then take away his Hand, that he might see his <HI>back Parts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 23.22, 23.</NOTE>. And accord∣ingly, <HI>The Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, mer∣ciful and gracious, long suffering, and abun∣dant in Goodness and Truth; keeping Mercy for Thousands, forgiving Iniquity, and Trans∣gression, and Sin, and that will by no Means clear the guilty.</HI> Exod. 34.6, 7. We must then celebrate the transcendent Excellencies of the Lord of Glory, and so sacrifice Praise, as to glorify God, and pay the Tri∣bute of Honour due to his Name; acknow∣ledging that there is none like unto him,
<PB N="14" REF="009269_0013_10320D93CC265618"/>
none that may be compared with him. <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.13. <HI>And every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and such as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I, saying, Blessing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power be unto him that sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI> But we may speak further of this, under the last Head, which treats of the divine Majesty.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>Victory is the Lord's.</HI> Prov. 21.31. <HI>The Horse is prepared against the Day of Battle; but Safety is of the Lord.</HI> Margin, <HI>Victory.</HI> He is the God of Ar∣mies, the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 24.8.</NOTE> The Lord of Hosts holds the Events of War in his Almighty Hand, so that the Race is not to the swift, <HI>nor the Battle to the strong;</HI> but Time and Chance happen to them all.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 9.11.</NOTE> There are certain Incidents which God over-rules to give Success to the weaker Side. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.6. <HI>There is no Restraint to the Lord, to save by many or by few.</HI> Was there Time, I might here speak of our <HI>spiritual Warfare,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="009269_0014_10320D955205B178"/>
and shew that God gives his People the Victory over their ghostly Enemies. The Almighty ordain'd Strength out of the Mouth of Babes, when he sent forth his Apostles and other Ministers, to set up his Kingdom on the Ruins of Satan's usurped Dominion: The Weapons of their Warfare were migh∣ty through God, for pulling down the strong Holds of the Evil One, and for sub∣duing a considerable Part of the then know World, to the Obedience of Faith. The Lord triumph'd over Principalities and Pow∣ers, over the Lusts of Men, and the strong Prejudices of Education; so that the Rulers of the Darkness of this World fled before the Light of the glorious Gospel, accompanied with the divine Spirit, as the Shades of Night before the rising Sun. But to return, and consider War in a literal Sense, as manag'd by <HI>Arms of Flesh,</HI> and we shall find that God has in a wonderful Manner broken the Enemies and Oppressors of his People, and deliver'd them from those that were too strong for them. Thus when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> pursued his ancient People whom he brought forth out of <HI>Egygt</HI> with a mighty Hand, and out-stretched Arm;
<PB N="16" REF="009269_0015_10320D9768749528"/>
the God of Israel divided the Red-Sea, and gave his People a safe Passage thro' it, as on dry Ground; and overthrew their Enemies. The Depths cover'd them, they sank to the Bottom as a Stone. Then sang <HI>Moses,</HI> and the Children of <HI>Israel;</HI> the Lord triumphed gloriously: the Horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea. <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.1. Ver. 6. <HI>Thy right Hand, O Lord, is become glorious in Power: thy right Hand, O Lord, hath dashed in Pieces the Enemy.</HI> Ver. 10, 11. <HI>Thou didst blow with thy Wind, the Sea covered them: they sank as Lead in the mighty Waters. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the Gods? Who is like thee, glorious in Holi∣ness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders.</HI> In like Manner, God open'd a Way for his People thro' <HI>Jordan,</HI> into the Land of <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI> and subdued Nations greater and mightier than they. The mighty Redeemer appear'd to <HI>Joshua</HI> when entred <HI>Canaan,</HI> in humane Shape, and as Captain of the Lord's Host. Under this divine Person, and encourag'd by his Presence, this victorious General marched at the Head of the Ar∣mies of Israel. The Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="009269_0016_10320D998D8ED728"/>
miraculously fell before them, as by an Earthquake; they enter the open Breaches, and destroy it. After this the <HI>Sun stood still</HI> at <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Prayer, and hasted not to go down for about a whole Day, until the People had avenged themselves upon their Enemies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Joshua 3.5, 6, 10 Ch.</NOTE> God's People accordingly ac∣knowledg'd that it was the Lord who did drive out the Heathen with his Hand, and planted them. Hear their Song, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 44.3. <HI>For they got not the Land in Possession by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm save them: but thy right Hand, and thine Arm, and the Light of thy Counte∣nance, because thou hadst a Favour unto them.</HI> Thus the Royal Psalmist <HI>David,</HI> when deli∣vered from his Enemies, praiseth the Name of the Lord. The Lord is my Deliverer, my Strength, and the Horn of my Salvati∣on; and gives God the Glory of his military Virtues and Success, Psalm. 18.34, 35. <HI>He teacheth my Hands to War, so that a Bow of Steel is broken by mine Arms. Thou hast also given me the Shield of thy Salvation: and thy right Hand hath holden me up, and thy Gentleness hath made me great.</HI> In like

Manner, They that had gotten the Victory over <HI>Antichrist,</HI> sing the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> the Servant of God, and the Song of the <HI>Lamb,</HI> saying, <HI>Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God almighty; just and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints,</HI> Rev. 15.3. And in the 19th Ch. 1, 2. <HI>And after these Things I heard a great Voice of much People in Heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lord our God: For true and righteous are his Judgments; for he hath judged the great Whore,</HI> i.e. idolatrous <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. THE <HI>Majesty is the Lord's. With God is terrible Majesty,</HI> Job 37.22. Maje∣sty to be reverene'd and adored with all Humility. Dominion and Fear are with him. The Splendor of some earthly Prin∣ces has been glorious but none to be com∣pared with the Lord. When the Prophet had a Vision of the Lord in his Glory, we read, <HI>Isai.</HI> 6.1—3. <HI>I saw the Lord sitting upon a Throne, high and lifted up, and his Train filled the Temple: Above it stood the Seraphims; each one had six Wings; with Twain he covered his Face, and with</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="009269_0018_10320D9CE2C74A30"/>
<HI>Twain he covered his Feet, and with Twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</HI> The Most High <HI>is cloathed with Honour and Majesty;</HI> He covereth himself with Light as with a Garment,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 104.1, 2.</NOTE> yea, such is the in∣sufferable Brightness of the divine Majesty, that he <HI>dwells in the Light which no Man can approach unto,</HI> whom no Man hath seen, nor can see.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 6.16</NOTE> When the Son of God, the second Person in the adorable Trinity, ap∣pear'd to <HI>Saul,</HI> it was in Light above the Brightness of the Sun; he fell to the Earth, and it should seem was struck blind. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Act. 9.</NOTE> And when he appeare'd to <HI>John,</HI> his Countenance was as the Sun shineth in his Strength; and when he saw him, he fell at his Feet as dead.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rev. 1.16, 17.</NOTE> It is in Condescension to our pre∣sent Weakness, that he holdeth back the Face of his Throne, and spreadeth his Cloud upon it.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Job 26 9.</NOTE> Otherwise such Lustre would dazle our Sight, and over-power us.

<P><HI>USE</HI> 1. LEARN that <HI>God is worthy of our highest Esteem, and strongest Love.</HI></P>
<P>JEHOVAH is truly <HI>Optimus Maximus,</HI> the best and the greatest. Yea, he is infinitely great and good; so that we may well cry out with Admiration, How great is his Goodness, how great is his Beauty! Agree∣ably our Lord and Lawgiver teacheth us,
<PB N="21" REF="009269_0020_10320DA0CD9A0E40"/>
<HI>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind. This is the first and great Commandment,</HI> Matth. 22.37, 38. God is Light, in whom is no Darkness at all: <HI>The Father of Lights,</HI> from whom every good Gift, and every perfect Gift, comes down. And if we behold him in the Light of Re∣velation, and as he manifests himself to us in his Son, the <HI>Brightness of the Father's Glory,</HI> he appears to be a suitable and al∣sufficient Good, to whom the apostate Sons of <HI>fallen Adam</HI> may return, so as to find Rest and full Contentment in him. O let us then beseech the Father of Glory to give us the Spirit of Wisdom in the Knowledge of him; that we may now say as <HI>Psal.</HI> 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee.</HI> And that <HI>beholding</HI> as in a Glass the <HI>Glory of the Lord,</HI> we may be changed into his Image <HI>from Glory to Glory,</HI> as by the Spirit of the Lord.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 3.18.</NOTE> And that when many say, who will <HI>shew us good?</HI> we may from our Hearts say, <HI>Lord lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us.</HI>

Thus God will put Gladness into our Hearts, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increased. And when we behold his Face in Righteousness, we shall be forever satisfied with his Likeness. For He is the Light of Heaven, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.23. <HI>And the City had no Need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it: for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof.</HI> In his Presence is Fulness of Joy, at his right Hand are Plea∣sures for ever more.</P>

Surely none can compre∣hend it. Let us then hear and obey that Word, <HI>Isai.</HI> 8.13, 14. <HI>Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your Fear, and let him be your Dread. And he shall be for a Sanctuary.</HI> And those Words of our Saviour Jesus Christ, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.28. <HI>And fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both Soul and</HI>

<HI>Body in Hell.</HI> O it is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God, as a Judge and Avenger of Sin! But our Lord Jesus Christ, tho' in the <HI>Form of God,</HI> took upon him the <HI>Form of a Servant,</HI> and be∣came obedient unto Death, the Death of the Cross, that he might deliver us from Sin and the Curse: wherefore God hath highly exalted him. The Father of Glory declares, <HI>I set my King on my holy Hill of Zion;</HI> and that such as refuse to submit to his righteous and equal <HI>Scepter,</HI> must be broken to Pieces as with a <HI>Rod of Iron.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 2.</NOTE> Yea, when our Lord and Judge shall fall upon them in the Day of his Wrath, he will grind <HI>them to Powder.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matth. 21.44.</NOTE> O let the Sinners in Zion then be afraid, cast down the Wea∣pons of your Rebellion, and cry for Mercy! Seek Reconciliation with God thro' the Blood of Christ's Cross: For <HI>he is our Peace.</HI> When <HI>Solomon</HI> had considered the Vanity of all Things under the Sun, he says, <HI>Let us hear the Conclusion of the whole Matter, Fear God and keep his Com∣mandments: for this is the whole Duty of Man,</HI> Eccl. 12.13. Hebrew, the <HI>whole of</HI>

Man. It is "his whole Work and Busi∣ness, his whole Perfection and Happiness."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pool.</NOTE> And if we thus fear God, we need fear nothing else with any Amazement, <HI>Psal.</HI> 46.1.2. <HI>God is our Refuge and Strength, a very present Help in Trouble: Therefore will not we fear, though the Earth be re∣moved, and though the Mountains be carried into the Midst of the Sea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> 3. Then <HI>we should trust in the Lord, and fly to his Name as to our strong Tower,</HI> in all Times of threatning Danger.</P>
<P>GOD is a present Help to his People, ever near, ever able to deliver them. His Hand is not shortned, that it cannot save; neither his Ear heavy, that it can∣not hear. Therefore the same <HI>Prophet</HI> says to us, <HI>Trust ye in the Lord forever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting Strength,</HI> Isai. 26.4. Hebrew, <HI>The Rock of Ages:</HI> And He is to his People as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land. Accordingly, the Man is <HI>cursed that trusteth in Man, and maketh Flesh his Arm:</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="009269_0024_10320DA8DDD000F8"/>
The Man is <HI>blessed that trusteth in the Lord, and whose Hope the Lord is</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 17.5.7.</NOTE>. Let such then as fear the Lord be encouraged to trust in the Lord; for He is their Help, and their Shield.</P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> 4. Is GOD a Being of adorable Perfections, then <HI>happy is the Person, hap∣py the People whose God is the Lord.</HI> Psal. 146.5. <HI>Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his Help, whose Hope is in the Lord his God.</HI> In a particular Manner, God promised his ancient People, that if <HI>they</HI> kept his Commandment, <HI>five should chase an hundred, and an hundred put ten thousand to flight.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lev. 27.8.</NOTE> Now God is with his People while <HI>they</HI> are with him, and walk before him as his obedient People. This is then to grasp all Rules of Policy in one, to secure the Almighty on our Side; for if God be for us, who shall be against us? Then we may boldly say, <HI>The Lord is my Helper, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</HI> Hebr. 13.6. O let us then con∣tinue instant in Prayer to God, that He would pour out his Spirit upon us from
<PB N="26" REF="009269_0025_10320DAA6D5813F8"/>
on high, and write his Laws upon our Hearts, that we may put away those pro∣voking Sins which separate between us and our God; and that we may serve him in Holiness and Righteousness before him all the Days of our Life. Then the God of Armies would still ride upon the Heaven for our Help, and in his Excellen∣cy on the Sky; and it should be said to us as to his People of old, Deut. 33.29. <HI>Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee, O People saved by the Lord, the Shield of thy Help, and who is the Sword of thy Excellen∣cy! And thine Enemies shall be found Liars unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high Places.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> 5, and last. THEN when <HI>God prospers the military Enterprises of his People,</HI> and crowns them with the desired Success, <HI>we should give the Glory to Him;</HI> and devoutly say, Thine, O Lord, is the Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majesty. We should sing the Praises of the most High, as Exod. 15.1, 2. <HI>Then sang Moses and the Children of Israel this Song unto the Lord,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="009269_0026_10320DAC883739C8"/>
<HI>and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously; the Horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea. The Lord is my Strength and Song, and he is become my Salvation.</HI> O that we could go on, and say as follows in the latter Part of the 2d Verse, <HI>He is my God, and I will prepare Him an Habitation; my Fathers God, and I will exalt Him.</HI> Then we might hope, that the Lord of Hosts would give us further Occasion to give Thanks unto his holy Name, and to triumph in his Praise.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were uni∣ted with <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> against the King of PRUSSIA, and the Armies under him; there was a strong Combination against the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest: But be∣hold the Lord who cuts off the Spirit of Princes, and takes away their Breath as He pleaseth, sets up another <HI>Head</HI> over that vast Empire, who favours our Cause. A seasonable Interpostion of divine Providence! And we are infor∣med, that <HI>Sweden</HI> also is brought to Terms of Reconciliation. However, the
<PB N="28" REF="009269_0027_10320DAE54F74388"/>
Alliance appeared formidable, when the Wealth and Forces of <HI>Spain</HI> were added to the Powers of <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> those great Supporters of <HI>Antichrist.</HI> Accor∣dingly, the Day after War was proclaimed with <HI>Spain,</HI> our honoured Rulers, being in General Court assembled, met with us in the House of God, <HI>April</HI> 15, last, to seek Direction and Help from God in this important Conjuncture. And now in less than half a Year, the <HI>Great and General Court</HI> again assemble with God's People in the House of Prayer, to unite with us, and lead in Songs of Praise to the God of Victory for signal Successes lately granted against <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>We have an authentick Account, that the accomplished General Prince FERDI∣NAND, tho' much inferior in Numbers, yet by a superior Reach of military Con∣duct and Skill, surprised and encompass'd the <HI>French</HI> Army, and put them to flight; and such of them as boldly opposed their Pursuit, tho' the Flower of the <HI>French</HI> In∣fantry, were blasted, and in a great Mea∣sure cut to Pieces, or made Prisoners:

Our Joy is the greater in that the valiant Lord GRANBY, who commanded the English Troops, had a great Share in the Victory. We praise the Lord, the God of Salvation, Exod. 15.3, <HI>The Lord is a Man of War: The Lord is his Name.</HI> Our Joy is much increased by the great and good News of the Conquest of the HA∣VANNAH,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>HAVANA, a Port-Town of the Island of CUBA in AMERICA. A capacious Harbour, of very difficult Ac∣cess to an Enemy, having a narrow Entrance, well de∣fended by Forts and Platforms of great Guns. Here the Galleons from PORTO-BELLO and VERA CRUZ rendez∣vous on their Return to SPAIN. <HI>Salmon's Gazetteer.</HI></P>
<P>CUBA — 300 Leagues in length, and generally be∣tween 20 and 30 Leagues broad. They have great Rains and Tempests usally in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August. [How kind and merciful was GOD to Us! that these were so far restrained while our Forces besieged the City]</HI> The <HI>Havannah</HI> says the same Author, is situated at the North West Part of the Island. <HI>Salmon's Modern History.</HI></P></NOTE> a rich City in <HI>Spanish America,</HI> very strongly fortified, and resolutely de∣fended by numerous Forces. A City of <HI>great Importance,</HI> it being <HI>the Key</HI> which opens a Communication between <HI>Old and New Spain,</HI> where, it is said, the Enemy lay up vast Treasures from <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> till <HI>they</HI> have a convenient Oppor∣tunity
<PB N="30" REF="009269_0029_10320DB1D78A5630"/>
for transportation. Accordingly, we have an Account of great Sums of Money already found, from which our Forces, under the General Lord ALBER∣MARLE, and Admiral POCOCKE, we hope will reap a rich Reward of their great Toils and Valour. By this Conquest, our Enemies are also greatly weakened as to their <HI>Naval Force,</HI> Nine Ships of the Line being taken, others sunk to defend the Harbour, others on the Stocks, or lately launched; together with great naval and other military Stores.</P>
<P>Let us then sacrifice Praise to the GOD of Armies, who has led our victo∣rious Troops into this strong City, of which our Enemies were ready to boast, as if it was invincible, The Royal Psal∣mist inquired, <HI>Who will bring me into the strong City: who will lead me into Edom? Wilt not Thou, O God?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm 108.10, 11.</NOTE> Yes, surely. <HI>This is the Lord's Doing, it is marvellous in our Eves. Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, fear∣ful in Praises, doing Wonders. Thy right Hand, O Lord, is become Glorious in Power;</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="009269_0030_10320DB3A5AE4550"/>
<HI>Thy right Hand, O Lord, bath dashed in Pieces the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>MAY we be directed to make a wise Improvement of such remarkable Ap∣pearances of God for us! May the Lord preserve us from Pride, and all carnal Confidence in an Arm of Flesh! Let us humble ourselves under the mighty Hand of God, and with deep Abasement ac∣knowledge our own Sinfulness and great Unworthiness, saying, <HI>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us; but unto thy Name give Glory.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm 115.1.</NOTE> While we render due <HI>civil Praise</HI> to the brave Commanders and Soldiers, whom God has made Instruments in this glo∣rious Work, let our <HI>religious Praises</HI> as∣cend to GOD by JESUS CHRIST, our great High-Priest. O may we yield to him, the God of Salvation, not only the Fruit of our Lips; but the Love of our Hearts, and the Obedience of our Lives. O may his Gaodness lead us to Repen∣tance, and we not be suffered to abuse the Riches of it, and so to treasure up Wrath. May we by his Spirit be formed
<PB N="32" REF="009269_0031_10320DB5A8C96BE8"/>
as a peculiar People to shew forth his Praise. Thus we may hope further to see the Good of his Chosen, to rejoice with the Gladness of his Nation, and to glory with his Inheritance.</P>
<P>AND now let us pray for all in Autho∣rity; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Ho∣nesty. Let us pray for the KING as su∣pream, that the Father of Lights would furnish him with all Royal Gifts and Graces; clothe his Enemies with Shame; but upon Him may the Crown flourish. The Lord build his Servant a sure House! Let us pray that our <HI>honoured Rulers</HI> un∣der him, may lead in the necessary Work of Reformation by their Authority, and by their Example. Yea, let us lift up a Prayer to the Father of Glory, that the Kingdom of his dear Son may be set up throughout the World, and that He, whose Right it is, would take to himself his great Power and Reign: May He ride forth conquering, and to conquer, until the Kingdoms of this World shall become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his

Christ; that these uttermost Parts of the Earth may be given to him for his Possession, and the <HI>Natives of the Wilderness</HI> bow before him as his willing People in the Day of his Power. Thus may <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa, Europe</HI> and <HI>America</HI> join in Songs of Praise to our glorious Lord, and enjoy the Blessings of his King∣dom, Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost. I close with those Words in the 72d Psalm, which treats ultimately and principally of the Glory of CHRIST'S Kingdom, the great Antitype, Verses 18th, and 19th, <HI>Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doth won∣drous Things. And blessed be his glorious Name for ever; and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory.</HI> AMEN and AMEN.</P>
