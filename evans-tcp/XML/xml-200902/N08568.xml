<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN DISNEY, with five other Gentlemen, residing in the District of <HI>Montreal,</HI> had been taken up in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> 1766, for the cruel Assault com∣mitted about two Years ago, upon Mr. <HI>Thomas Walker.</HI> They were apprehended by Virtue of Warrants of the Honourable WILLIAM HEY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his Majesty's Chief-Justice of the Pro∣vince of <HI>Quebec,</HI> which are sounded upon a long, minute, and positive Information given against them, upon Oath, before the said Chief Justice, by <HI>George M'Govock,</HI> a Soldier of the 28th Regiment of Foot, who declared himself to have been an Accomplice with them in that Affair, and to have been an Eye-witness of all the proceedings in it. The Persons so apprehended immediately came to <HI>Quebec,</HI> and applied to the Chief-Justice to be bailed; and many of the principal Persons in the Province offered to become bound for their Appearance, at the ensuing Session of the Supreme Court, at <HI>Montreal,</HI> in order to take their Trials. But, by reason of the Magnitude of the Crime, (it being a Capital Offence, of a very odious Nature) and the Positiveness of the Charge against them, the Chief-Justice thought he was not at Liberty, consistently with the Rules of Law, to admit them to Bail; grounding his Opinion herein, both on the general Principles of the Law relating to Bail in criminal Cases, and on some very strong modern Authorities on this Sub∣ject, and particularly the two Cases of <HI>Acton</HI> and <HI>Greenwood,</HI> reported in Sir <HI>John Strange</HI>'s Reports, Page 851 and 1138, which seem to be decisive in the Point. They were therefore committed to Custody, but confined in the easiest and most in∣dulgent Manner possible in Mr. <HI>William Grant</HI>'s House, at <HI>Montreal,</HI> which is said to be the best House in the Province; it having been suggested, as a Ground for this Indulgence, that the King's Prison at <HI>Montreal</HI> was in bad Repair, and not in a fit Condition to receive them. On the 28th Day of the <HI>February</HI> following, in the Year 1767, the Chief-Justice held a Session of the Supreme-Court of Judicature at <HI>Montreal,</HI> both for criminal and civil Matters, which was continued by several Adjournments to the Middle of <HI>March.</HI> And about the 8th or 9th Day of <HI>March,</HI> a Bill of Indictment, that had been presented to the Grand Jury against Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> by the Attorney-General was returned by them a true Bill; and on the 11th Day of the same Month, Captain <HI>Disney</HI> was tried upon this Indictment, and acquitted.</P>

<HEAD>After the Prisoner had pleaded not guilty to the Indictment, and the Jury were duly sworn and charged to try the Issue, the Case was opened to the Court and Jury by FRANCIS MASERES, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his Majesty's Attorney-General for the Province of <HI>Quebec,</HI> (who was the only Person of Counsel for the Crown on this Occasion) in some such Manner as hereafter followeth:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honour, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my Duty, as Prosecutor for the Crown, on the present Oc∣casion, to lay open to you the Circumstances of the Crime with which the Prisoner at the Bar stands charged; which I am persuaded you will look upon as one of the most outrageous Violations of the of the public Peace and Order that ever was brought before a Court of Justice; Nothing less than assaulting a Magistrate of unblemished Character in his own House, in the Night-time, with an Intention to murder him;—and this in Revenge for an Act done by him as a Magistrate, in Conjunction with three other Magistrates of the Province, in Support, as he thought, at least, of the Laws and Liberties of his Country.—If this is an Action that ought not to be the Subject of a Prosecution, surely nothing can deserve to be so: And if those who are charged with being guilty of it are just Objects of the Compassion of the Public, I know not what Offenders can excite their Indignation. It approaches in a great Degree to the most dangerous of all civil Crimes, High Treason itself, as it has an immediate Tendency to over awe, to check, and even entirely to stop the Proceedings of the Magistrates of the Pro∣vince in the Administration of Public Justice; without which our excellent Laws are but a dead Letter, and our boasted Liberties and Properties an empty Sound: And it was attended with Circumstan∣ces of deliberate Malice, Revenge, and Cruelty, that, in the Opini∣on of all Persons not destitute of the Feelings of Humanity, must make it completely odious: To which may be added the less impor∣tant Circumstance of the cowardly Manner of its Execution, if the employing ten or twelve armed Men to surprise and attack one poor, unsuspecting, unarmed Man, sitting peaceably at Home in the Com∣pany of his Wife and Family, can entitle it to that Appellation.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am sorry to observe further, that the Persons who committed this Outrage were Military Men: For surely this is an Aggravation of the Offence. It is in them an Act of Treachery: It is betraying the high and honourable Trust reposed in them by their King and Country, by employing to the Purposes of Revenge and Malice those Arms which had been put into their Hands for the Protection of their Fellow-Subjects, and the Maintenance of the Public Tranquility.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now lay before you, in the first Place, the Oc∣casion that gave rise to the Crime with which the Prisoner at the
<PB N="8" REF="010958_0005_0F852F26A1647E10"/>
Bar stands charged, and afterwards the Manner and Circumstances of its Execution and the Share the Prisoner at the Bar took in it.</P>
<P>When the Civil Government was established in this Province, in the Year 1764, a Number of Persons, in the District of <HI>Montreal,</HI> were commissioned by Governor MURRAY, to act as Justices of the Peace for that District, and new and great Powers of determining. Matters of Civil Property, not belonging to those Magistrates in <HI>England,</HI> were given them by the great Ordinance of <HI>September</HI> 17th, of that Year, by which the Courts of Judicature were erected. Among the Persons so commissioned were Mr. <HI>Thomas Walker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dumas St. Martin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Livingston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Knipe,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lambe:</HI> These Gentle∣men, as I am informed, all of them acted in their new Office with Honour and Integrity, and gave general Satisfaction to the People by their diligent Endeavours to promote their Welfare. There was one Abuse in particular which they earnestly laboured to reform, as it was then very generally and very severely felt by the Inhabitants of <HI>Montreal,</HI> and the Subject of frequent Complaints. This was the Oppression exercised by some Officers of the Army, under the Co∣lour and Pretence of their Right of billetting Soldiers. The Power of appointing Billets was often employed by them to serve the Pur∣poses of gratifying their private Disgusts, and of extorting Money from the People. Three or four of the most drunken and riotous of the Soldiers would be sent to take up their Quarters at the House of a substantial Citizen, that was thought able to pay a good Price for an Exemption. This would alarm him, and oblige him to make the humblest and most earnest Intreaties to be excused from receiv∣ing them; upon which an Intimation would be given him, that, if he would consent to pay Six or Eight Dollars a Month in Lieu of it, he might be excused, and the Soldiers with that Money would pro∣vide themselves other Quarters. This the poor Man would readily submit to (if he could by any Means raise the Money) rather than see his House taken up, his Furniture broken and spoil'd, his Provi∣sions wasted, and sometimes his Wife and Daughters insulted by such boisterous and profligate Inmates: And thus by paying the Tax required he would obtain his Exemption. They would then go to another Citizen of two, and by the like Menaces extort from them the like Contributions. Those were the Oppressions which Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> and his Fellow-Magistrates endeavoured to remove. Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> in particular, drew out a Scheme for billeting the Soldiers, by which he made it appear, that there was no Necessity that more than two Soldiers should ever be quartered in one House, whereas there were several Houses at that Time that were burthened with five or six: So that the Hardships the People laboured under in this Respect were by no Means Evils of Necessity (in which Case they ought patiently to have been submitted to) but were mere Abuses of Power, to answer these sinister Purposes.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010958_0005_0F852F26A1647E10"/>Gentlemen, in the Beginning of the Month of <HI>November,</HI> 1764. Complaint, that took its Rise from this Power of billeting, was brought before Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Livingston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dumas,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lambe,</HI> the Justices of the Peace before mentioned, against Captain <HI>Benjamin Charnock Payne,</HI> of the 28th Regiment, which proved the immediate. Occasion of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Sufferings. Captain <HI>John Fraser,</HI> Pay-Master-General of the Troops in the District of <HI>Mon∣treal,</HI> and one of the Prisoners now in Custody on Account of this Affair, had been billeted by Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Christie,</HI> the Quar∣ter-Master-General, on the House of one Mr. <HI>Reamue,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman in <HI>Montreal,</HI> where he accordingly resided till the latter End of <HI>October,</HI> or Beginning of <HI>November,</HI> 1764, at which Time he was appointed to an Office by which he became entitled to, or at least possessed of, a House at the Public Expence; upon which he left his Quarters at Mr. <HI>Reaume</HI>'s House, and went to live in the House, so assigned him. Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> imagining his Billet was at an End, immediately invited Mr. <HI>Knipe,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman, who was at that Time in the Commission of the Peace, and who occupied the Rooms underneath those possessed by Captain <HI>Fraser</HI> and had hired those likewise of Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> at the Time that Cap∣tain <HI>Fraser</HI> was about to leave them, but had not yet taken possession of them, to come and take Possession of them according to his Agreement. But he was prevented from doing so by Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> who took, Possession of them in the Name and Right of Cap∣tain <HI>Fraser,</HI> who insisted that he still retained a Right to these Quar∣ters, and might either occupy them himself, if he so thought fit, or permit any other Person to occupy them in his Name. Mr. <HI>Reaume</HI> desired Captain <HI>Payne</HI> to resign them to Mr. <HI>Knipe,</HI> to whom he had let them; but Captain <HI>Payne</HI> refused to quit them, and insisted upon his Right to continue in them by Virtue of Captain <HI>Fraser</HI>'s Billet. Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> thought these Pretensions of Captain <HI>Fraser,</HI> to occupy these Quarters thus by Deputy, to be both hard and illegal, and wrote two or three Letters to him to complain of them: But, instead of receiving any kind of Satisfaction, he was answered in a Style of in∣credible and unsufferable Insolence. Upon this he applied to the other Justices for Redress; and Mr. <HI>Livingston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dumas,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> held a Court in Mr. <HI>Reaume</HI>'s House, to inquire into the Affair; and being satisfied by the Depositions of Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> and Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> had, by a fair Agreement, hired the Apartments in in Question of Mr. <HI>Reaume,</HI> long before Captain <HI>Payne</HI> came into them, and being of Opinion likewise that Captain <HI>Fraser</HI>'s Right to them was at an End the Moment he became possessed at the Public Expence of another Lodging, which he thought a better one, they determined that Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> had a legal Right to the Apartments, and that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> ought to resign them to him. And accord∣ingly,
<PB N="10" REF="010958_0006_0F852F27512A8FD0"/>
in Conjunction with Mr. <HI>Lambe,</HI> a fourth Justice of the Peace, they signed a Warrant to a Bailiff, to command Captain <HI>Payne</HI> to quit that Lodging. In what Manner this Command of the Justices was to be enforced, I do not find to be certainly agreed. Those who are disposed to censure this Proceeding of the Justices, say that there was a Clause in the Warrant commanding the Bailiff to carry Captain <HI>Payne</HI> to Prison, if he refused to quit the Lodging, and should make Resistance; others inform me otherwise: This however seems to be certain, that it was never their Intention that Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> should be imprisoned. This will appear by the sub∣sequent Part of their Conduct.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I will now minutely inquire how far these Proceed∣ings of the Justices were legal, that is, how far they had Right to inquire into and determine this Contest between Mr. <HI>Knipe</HI> and Cap∣tain <HI>Payne,</HI> and to enforce their Decision of it (if they did so en∣force it) by the Penalty of Imprisonment. But I will only observe that there seems to be a very reasonable Ground for supposing that all these Things were within their Jurisdiction by Virtue of the Powers before mentioned, given by the great Ordinance of <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> 17, 1764, to any two Justices of the Peace to hear and deter∣mine any Disputes concerning Matters of Civil Property, not ex∣ceeding the Value of ten Pounds, which probably might take in the present Contest. Nor need we inquire whether or no the Decision they thought proper to make, that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> had no Right to these Apartments, was good in Point of Law: Though here, as well as before, I should incline to think that the Law was with them: For, if we consider that the being free from the Necessity of quar∣tering Soldiers is one of the greatest and most valued Privileges of an <HI>English</HI> Subject—that it is one of the great Points of Liberty ascertained and confirmed for ever by that best of Laws in the Statute-Book, the Petition of Right in the third Year of <HI>Charles</HI> the First—That all the Laws of <HI>England</HI> had been introduced into this Province by the great Ordinance of the 17th of <HI>September,</HI> 1764, and that these favourite and beneficial ones were promised by the King's Proclamation, in 1763—and that in <HI>England</HI> itself the Troops are only quartered hi Public-Houses, but never in pri∣vate ones; and that only by Virtue of a particular Act of Parlia∣ment, annually passed for that purpose; we shall nor wonder at the unwillingness shewn by these worthy Magistrates to allow of the Le∣gality of billeting Soldiers upon private Houses upon any other Ground but that of mere Necessity; or for any longer Time than such Necessity continued; of which, in the Case then before them, there could be no Pretence, since the Moment Captain <HI>Fraser</HI> re∣ceived a House from the Government, in consequence of his new Employment, which by going to live in it he acknowledged to be better than his Quarters, it was evidently no longer necessary that
<PB N="11" REF="010958_0006_0F852F27512A8FD0"/>
those Quarters should belong to him. But whether they were right or wrong in their Opinions upon these Points is not very material. This is certain, that they meant to determine a Matter that they took to be within their Cognizance, and that they meant to deter∣mine it according to Law, and to do Justice to the Person they thought to be aggrieved. They therefore ought rather to have re∣ceived the Thanks of their Fellow-Subjects for their faithful and spirited Discharge of their Duty, than to have become the Objects of so deep and deadly a Revenge.</P>
<P>This Warrant of the Justices of the Peace was served upon Cap-<HI>Payne</HI> the next Day, or rather, if it be true that there was a Clause of Imprisonment in it, but half served by one of the Bailiffs of of the District. For the Bailiff shewed it him, and required him to give up the Apartments to Mr. <HI>Knipe;</HI> but did not, upon the Cap∣tain's refusing to do so, offer to make him a Prisoner, or convey him to the Gaol. He neither laid hold on him, as is usual in Arrests, nor said to him, <HI>You are to my Prisoner,</HI> nor told him that he had Or∣ders to carry him to Prison. But Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> as if anxiously desirous of suffering an Indignity that might serve to irritate the Soldiers to a high Pitch, and dispose them to some desperate Act of Revenge against Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> insisted upon going to Prison, and forced the Bailiff to shew him the Way thither. The Bailiff com∣plied, and the Captain went to Gaol: And when he got there, the Keeper of the Prison was unwilling to receive him, because he had not a Warrant directed to himself to authorize him to do so. But the Captain insisted upon continuing in the Prison. In the mean Time the Bailiff went and acquainted the Justices with what had happened, who immediately sent him back to the Prison to ac∣quaint Captain <HI>Payne</HI> that he was not a Prisoner in Consequence of their Warrant, that it never was their Intention to commit him to Prison, and that he might go out of the Prison when he pleased: And at the same Time they sent him a Billet to be quartered at Mr. <HI>Croston's</HI> House, which was the very best Public-House in the whole Town, the Magistrates being unwilling, except where Necessity o∣bliged them to it, to give Billets upon private Houses. Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> however, thought fit to continue in the Prison, notwithstanding these Declarations from the Justices that he was at Liberty to leave it whenever he pleased; and that his Imprisonment might be the more public and make the deeper Impression on the Spirits of the Soldiers, he had Recourse to a more formal Method of obtaining his Discharge from it, by applying to the Chief-Justice of the Province for an <HI>Habeas Corpus:</HI> And by this Means he was set at Liberty.</P>
<P>When the Circumstances of this Affair came to be public, and it appeared that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> had been a voluntary Prisoner, and had continued so for several Days, it was by most People made the
<PB N="12" REF="010958_0007_0F852F281693D4B8"/>
Subject of Mirth and Laughter. This enraged the Captain to a high Degree, and made him resolve to seek some immediate Revenge against the Justices, and most particularly against Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> as having been the most active Man amongst them in all the Com∣plaints about the billeting of Soldiers, and, as he imagined, the principal Promoter of the Warrant by which he was ordered to give up his Quarters, and in consequence of which he had committed himself to Prison. Soon after a Resolution was taken to punish Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> for his Insolence (that was the Language they made use of) by setting a Mark upon him, or by disfiguring him in some signal and disgraceful Manner: And some of the wickedest and most desperate Soldiers of the 28th Regiment, under the Direction of two Sergeants of the same Character, Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and Sergeant <HI>Rogers,</HI> were employed to put it in Execution.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we shall produce a Witness that was himself employed in this Business, and was present at the Execution of it, and who is consequently well acquainted with all the Circumstances attending it. His Name is <HI>George M'Govock,</HI> and he is a Soldier of the 28th Regiment.</P>
<P>He will tell you, amongst other Things, Gentlemen, that on <HI>Monday</HI> the 3d of <HI>December,</HI> 1764, that is, three Days before the Perpetration of this Crime, he was desired by Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> (who and before that Time acquainted him with the Design and engaged him to be an Actor in it) to go with him to Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s House at <HI>Montreal</HI> (a Lieutenant and Adjutant of the 28th Regi∣ment, who was deeply concerned in this Affair) to meet some Gen∣men who were Friends, as the Sergeant told him, to the Design of configuring Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> though they were not of the 28th Regi∣ment, and to take an Oath of Secrecy never to discover any of them if they should happen to be present at the Execution of it: That he accordingly went with Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> to Lieutenant <HI>Tot∣tenham</HI>'s; and that when they got there, the Lieutenant himself opened the Door to them, and was accompanied by Captain <HI>Daniel Disney,</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar, and Lieutenant <HI>Simon Evans,</HI> of the 28th Regiment: That Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> said to him in the Passage, in the Presence of Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Evans,</HI> and Sergeant <HI>Meas,</HI> some Words to this purpose, George, <HI>this Gentle∣man</HI> (pointing to Captain <HI>Disney</HI>) <HI>and others that are within, are de∣sirous that you would promise that, if any of them should make any Attempt to disfigure</HI> Mr. Walker, <HI>you will never discover it, and that you would for their further Security, take an Oath to keep it secret:</HI> That there upon he consented to take the Oath, and took it immedi∣ately, Captain <HI>Disney</HI> administering it to him on a Book which Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> produced, and which the Witness believes to have been a Bible. Lieutenant <HI>Evans</HI> at the same Time threatened him, that, if ever he discovered it, he should soon be made an End of,
<PB N="13" REF="010958_0007_0F852F281693D4B8"/>
wherever he might happen to live, and that he himself would blow his Brains out. <HI>Tottenham</HI> thereupon said to <HI>Evans,</HI> that he need not be afraid of his discovering the Matter; for that Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and Sergeant <HI>Rogers</HI> knew him very well, and could answer for his being faithful.</P>
<P>After this Conversation in the Passage, Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and the Witness <HI>M'Govock</HI> went into the Parlour with Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> Lieu∣tenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Evans;</HI> and there they saw the following Persons, Captain <HI>John Campbell,</HI> of the 27th Regiment, Captain <HI>John Fraser,</HI> the Person already spoken of, Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Christie,</HI> Deputy-Quarter Master-General; M. <HI>St. Luc la Corne,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joseph Howard.</HI> He staid in this Room about a Quarter of an Hour, during which Time the Resolution taken to disfigure Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> was the general Subject of the Conversation. They all expressed their Approbation of this Design, and their Hopes that it would succeed. This Witness says that this Conversa∣tion was addressed to him or Sergeant <HI>Meas,</HI> or spoken with an evident Intention that they should hear it; and that Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> further explained to him the Design of introducing him and Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> into that Company to be that they might know that those Gentlemen who were there assembled were Friends to the Design of disfiguring Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and that therefore they might not be surprised or alarmed if they should see them engaged in the Execution of it, either before, or at the same Time with, and as Assistants to, the Gentlemen of the 28th Regiment.</P>
<P>Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI> and the Witness then quitted the Parlour, after a Stay of something more than a Quarter of an Hour, and went, by Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s Direction into the Kitchen to drink, and af∣terwards returned home about Nine o'Clock.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, What I have here laid before you concerning this Conversation at Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s House, and the Oath of Secrecy administered to this Witness by the Prisoner at the Bar, I have spoken from the Deposition of this Witness, which I have here in my Hand and before my Eyes, with particular Care not to go one Jot beyond the Contents of it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I must further inform you, that this Oath of Secrecy had a great Effect upon the Mind of this Witness; a Circumstance that adds considerably to the Credit of his Testimony. When he had made his first Deposition, which made mention only of Persons to whom this Oath of Secrecy did not relate (which Deposition he swore to before Mr. <HI>Dumas St. Martin,</HI> the Justice of Peace, on the eight Day of last <HI>September</HI>) he was asked whether that Depo∣sition contained all he knew of the Matter; upon which he de∣clared that it did not, but said he would not reveal any more, be∣cause he could not do it without accusing certain other Persons that were concerned in that Affair, whom he conceived himself to
<PB N="14" REF="010958_0008_0F852F28D60B3BF8"/>
be under an Obligation never to discover, in Consequence of an Oath of Secrecy he had taken for that Purpose. He was afterwards brought before his Honour the present Chief-Justice, to confirm and swear again to this Deposition in the Presence of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> and myself. And his Scruple about the Oath of Secrecy being then mentioned as an Objection to his telling the rest of what he knew, he declared that he would be guided by the Opinion and Advice of the Chief-Justice and myself concerning the Obligation of this Oath: And upon our telling him that we thought such an Oath unlawful and void, that it was unlawful to take such an Oath, and still more unlawful to keep it, as it was contrary to a prior and stronger Obligation that every Man is under, for the Sake of the Public Good, to declare the whole of what he knows concerning any public Crimes, when called upon to do so in the Course of a judi∣cial Inquiry, he was persuaded to give up his Scruple and declare the rest of what he knew, which makes the Contents of his second Deposition. This Deposition I took down in the Course of a very long Examination in the Presence of his Honour the Chief-Justice and Mr. <HI>Walker;</HI> and can safely affirm that every Word of it came freely from the Witness without any Suggestions whatsoever from Mr. <HI>Walker;</HI> whose Conduct with respect to this Witness, so far as I have been able to observe it, has been so very strict and deli∣cate, that, instead of bribing him to swear as he should dictate to him, as Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Enemies have given out, to invalidate this Wit∣ness's Testimony, he has barely allowed him a necessary Mainte∣nance since he has made those Depositions, (not without some Dis∣satisfaction and Complaints of the Witness on that Account) and has cautioned him over and over to say nothing but what he was absolutely sure of: And now, since this Witness has been at <HI>Mon∣treal</HI> he has not taken, as I believe, the justifiable Precaution (nor have I, nor any other Person to my Knowledge, taken it for him) of reading over to this Witness either of his Deposi∣tions in Order to refresh his Memory against the present Trial. We leave him to relate to you what he can himself recollect of the Circumstances of this cruel Transaction, unassisted either by our Admonitions or his own former Accounts of them. I will not proceed in the Narration of this unhappy Business.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the 4th of <HI>December,</HI> the Day after the Meeting above-mentioned at Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s House, a Plot was laid in Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s House in the Presence of this Witness by Ser¦geant <HI>Meas,</HI> Sergeant <HI>Rogers, John M'Laughlin, James Coleman</HI> and <HI>Daniel Ashman,</HI> Soldiers of the 28th Regiment, to way-lay Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> that very Might about the Dusk of the Evening upon his Return from his Store-House to his Dwelling-house, which were at the Distance of about a Furlong from each other. The Design was to beat and disfigure him. (The Word constant
<PB N="15" REF="010958_0008_0F852F28D60B3BF8"/>
used in all their Consultations was, <HI>To disfigure.</HI>) And the Wit∣ness saw them go accordingly in the Evening into proper Places for accomplishing their Purpose, armed with Bayonets, and one of them with a Broad Sword. They staid upon the Parade in Hopes of meeting with Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> till past Eight o'Clock, and then went Home, concluding that Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> must have gone Home by some other Way. And this Witness heard some of them that Evening, give this Account of their Disappointment.</P>
<P>On the next Day, the <HI>Wednesday,</HI> another Design was concerted at Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s House, between the Hours of Ten and Eleven o'Clock in Morning, to way-lay Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> again that Evening near his own Dwelling-house, in Order to beat and disfigure him. This Witness was present at Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s House at the Time this Design was concerted; and the Persons who concerted it were Ser∣geant <HI>Rogers,</HI> Sergeant <HI>Meas, M'Laughlin, Coleman, Ashman,</HI> and <HI>Philip Castles,</HI> another Soldier of the 28th Regiment. And accord∣ingly about Eight o'Clock that Evening these Persons did set out from Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s House to different Parts of the Town, in Parties of two Men each. <HI>Rogers</HI> and <HI>Coleman</HI> were in one of these Parties, and did meet with Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and were seen and taken Notice, of by him, as he will inform you, as Persons, who, by their Looks and Behaviour, seemed to have some Design of attack∣ing him. But they were prevented from doing it by the Ap∣pearance of some People that had happened to come out just at that Time and followed Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and who, these Rus∣sians apprehended, might interpose in his Defence or raise an Alarm in the Neighbourhood. They therefore returned to Sergeant <HI>Meas</HI>'s House about Nine o'Clock. The Witness <HI>M'Govock</HI> heard them afterwards give this Account of their Disappointment.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday,</HI> the 6th of <HI>December,</HI> the Assault was actually com∣mitted. And though they had hitherto, according to the Account of <HI>George M'Govock,</HI> intended only to beat and disfigure Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> in such a Manner as to leave a lasting Mark of Disgrace upon him, they now seem to have changed their Purpose to a safer and more complete Revenge, by resolving first to murder him, and then to carry off one of his Ears in Triumph, as the <HI>Indians</HI> do the Scalp of an Enemy. That this was their Design at the Time of committing this Assault, will appear, not only from the Manner and Violence of the Blows they gave him, some wounding him on the Head with all their Force with Broad Swords, one with a Tomahawk, another with an Iron Bar upon the Loins, with a Design to break his Back but from the Words spoken by them at that Time, such as that the would finish and dispatch him, and their Declarations that they though he had been dead before they left him. Those Words, and the Blows which they accompanied, and most of the Circumstances attending the Assault itself, will be proved to you by the Testimony of Mr.
<PB N="16" REF="010958_0009_0F852F2C15F2E198"/>
<HI>Walker</HI> himself, as well as of the other Witness; and the Presence of Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar, on that Occasion, to en∣courage and animate the Soldiers who give, the Wounds, will be proved to you by the united Testimony of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker.</HI></P>
<P>About a Quarter before Nine o'Clock at Night, as Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> were sitting in their Hall at Supper, a sudden Noise was heard at the Door, as of a Number of People striving hastily to get into the House. This Noise was occasioned by their violent Manner of opening the Outer-Door, though shut only upon a Latch. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> upon hearing it immediately cried out <HI>Entrez,</HI> imagining it was, a Number of <HI>Canadians</HI> coming to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> up∣on Business as a Justice of Peace, as he had that whole Day had a great many such Applications: But almost in the same Instant, look∣ing towards the Door, and seeing through the Glass of the inner Door a Crowd of black Faces rising one above another, as they stood on the Steps without, she cried out with the utmost Surprise, <HI>Good God! What is this! This is Murder; this is the Army come to revenge themselves.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> saw them first; because she sat with her Face to the Door. Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> sat at the other End of the Table, with his Back to the Door and very near it; I think he can∣not have been more than four Feet from it, which is a Circum∣stance, Gentlemen, it will be proper you should attend to. While Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> was crying out in the Manner I have mentioned, the Russians entered the Room, bursting open the inner Glass-Door and breaking one of the Panes of Glass; and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> clearly distinguished Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar, to be one of them, notwithstanding the Crape he had over his Face, which is but an indifferent Disguise. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Exclama∣tion made Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> turn his Head back at the Instant they were entering, which gave him an Opportunity of having one short, but full View of them, and at a very small Distance, before he received a Blow: And it was in this full and near View of them that he clearly distinguished Captain <HI>Disney</HI> amongst their Number. He also took such Notice of two other Faces among them, that he thinks he should know them again whenever he should see them: But he declares they are not any of the Prisoners now in Custody in this Place, nor any other Persons whose Names he is acquainted with.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, upon the Sight of these Assassins, Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> start∣ed up from his Chair, and in rising received a Wound on the Fore-Part of his Head with a Broad-Sword. This Wound was five In∣ches long, and was given with such a Force that one of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Servants, who was then attending him and saw it given, con∣cluded that it must be mortal to him. Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> however did not sink under it, but recollecting that his Arms were in his Bed-Cham∣ber, he endeavoured to make towards it, in Hopes of making
<PB N="17" REF="010958_0009_0F852F2C15F2E198"/>
some Defence, and for that Purpose rushed into the Parlour which lay between the Hall and the Bed-Chamber. But he received so many Wounds from five or six of the Russians as he passed, that he never could reach the Bed-Chamber, but sunk down, spent with Wounds and the loss of Blood, into an armed Chair that was stand∣ing in the further Corner of the Parlour adjoining to the Door of the Bed-Chamber. In this helpless Condition he received several more Wounds and Blows all over his Body, both with Bludgeons and sharp Weapons, and in particular one very dangerous Blow on the Bone of his left Leg with some Iron Weapon, which the Witness <HI>M'Govock</HI> will inform you was given him by one <HI>Clark,</HI> who was by Trade a Smith, who carried with him a Piece of Iron fitted to his Hand besides a Bludgeon. He continued in this Situation for a short Time, half a Minute, perhaps, or a Minute, almost deprived of his Senses, but was roused to make one more Attempt to defend him∣self by the Terror occasioned by the Threat of instant Death. For he heard a Voice, which seemed to come from the opposite Corner of the Room, pronounce these Words, <HI>Damn him, let me come to him, and I'll dispatch the Villain with my Sword.</HI> Upon this he looked up, and saw two Persons, whom he conjectured to be Officers, ad∣vancing towards him from the opposite Corner of the Room, from which the Voice had seemed to come, one of whom was armed with Pistols, and the other held a Small Sword in his Hand, which he pointed at Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Breast. This latter Person Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> believed to be the Prisoner at the Bar; but as his Eyes were then full of Blood from the many Wounds he had received, and his Mind in great Confusion, he will not take upon him to swear it was he. But <HI>M'Govock</HI> the Accomplice, who was present on this Occa∣sion, will confirm the Suspicion of Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and inform you that he saw Captain <HI>Disney</HI> advance in that Manner, with his Sword drawn, towards Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and heard him pronounce those Words. Whoever it was, you will observe, Gentlemen, that it proves be∣yond a Doubt that the Intention of the Assassins at this Time was to murder Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and not barely to disfigure him. Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> resolved, though quite unarmed, to do what he could to defend himself, and accordingly advanced towards these two Persons and attacked them furiously with his Fists, and had the good Fortune to put aside the drawn Sword with his left Hand without receiving a Thrust from it. But he was immediately surrounded by the other Russians. One of these Seized him by the Throat; and Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> did the same to him, and at the same Time endeavoured to get near the Fire-Place in Order to take up the Shovel or Tongs for want of better Weapons. Upon this another of them took hold of his Right Thigh, and they both together endeavoured to lift him up and lay him on the Fire; the Terror of which cruel Death giving him new Strength and Spirit, he disengaged himself from them both,
<PB N="18" REF="010958_0010_0F852F2D110577B8"/>
by suddenly putting his Hands against the Chimney-Piece, and push∣ing himself from it with all his Force. But in the Instant of his doing this he received a deep and dangerous Wound from another of the Assassins on the left Side of the Head near the Crown, which felled him to the Ground; and soon after, while he lay helpless on the Floor, he received another most violent Blow on his Loins, which would have broke his Back (as no Doubt it was intended to do) if it had not been for a large Silver Buckle in the Waistband of his Breeches, which received the Blow and somewhat broke the Force of it, which was such that the Buckle was very much bent by it. After this blow on the Back, Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> continuing to lie helpless and almost motionless on the Floor, with his Face downwards, one of the Villains either knelt or sat upon his right Side, and cut off a Part of his right Ear, and endeavoured at the same Time to cut his Throat: But finding this to be difficult by Reason of the Motions Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> made to prevent it by squeezing his Head down close to his Shoulders, and putting up his left Hand (the little Finger of which was by this Means cut to the Bone) and being in a Hurry to get away, as the Neighbourhood began now to be alarmed, he made of with the Rest of his Companions without effecting it, and carried off the Ear in Triumph. They thought however that they had left Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> either dead or in a dying Condition: For Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> heard one of them say, just before they went off, <HI>Damn him, he is dead,</HI> and another say, <HI>We have done for him.</HI> And with good Rea∣son indeed they might suppose so, since there are very few Men in the World that could have survived such a Number of Wounds and Blows as he had received, they being no fewer than Three Score, of which Eight were dreadful Wounds from sharp Weapons, and Fifty-two were Confusions.</P>
<P>The Ear was immediately carried to Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham,</HI> as ap∣peared by his own Examination, where he says that two Men in disguise and masked, or with their Faces blacked, came into his House about 9 o'Clock at Night, and throwing down a Piece of Flesh upon the Table, said, <HI>There's that Rascal</HI> Walker's <HI>Ear,</HI> and then withdrew without saying a Word more. Mr. <HI>Welsh,</HI> the Offi∣cer of General <HI>Burton</HI>'s Guard, and Mr. <HI>Baker,</HI> the Surgeon's Mate of the Regiment, were at that Time with Mr. <HI>Tottenham.</HI> But it does not appear that they made any Attempt to stop the Men who brought them the Ear. As soon as they were gone, Mr.<HI>Tot∣tenham</HI> wrapped the Ear up in a Piece of Paper, and sent Mr. <HI>Welsh</HI> with it to General <HI>Burton,</HI> who some Hours after sent it to Mr. <HI>Lambe,</HI> the Justice of Peace before-mentioned, to be disposed of as he should think proper.</P>
<P>These Particulars of this Assault will all be proved to you by Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> himself without the Assistance of the Accomplice, whose Evidence however will confirm them and acquaint you with the
<PB N="19" REF="010958_0010_0F852F2D110577B8"/>
Names of the principal Persons concerned in the Execution of them. He will tell you that the Blow on the Head that brought Mr. <HI>Wal∣ker</HI> to the Ground and quite subdued him, was given him by Ser∣geant <HI>Meas</HI> with a Tomahawk, and that the Person who gave him the Blow on his Back when he was down was <HI>Thomas Donnelly,</HI> who afterwards boasted of it in the Hearing of the Witness, and said he thought he had broke his Back; and that Sergeant <HI>Rogers</HI> was the Man that cut off his Ear and carried it off.</P>
<P>While some of these Russians were employed in attacking Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> in the Manner that has been related, others of them were employed in assaulting and driving away the rest of the Family. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> and Miss <HI>Heard</HI> (who is since married to Mr. <HI>Wade,</HI> who was sitting at Supper with Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> and <HI>John Lilly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Clerk) escaped through the Kitchen into the Yard; where, not being pursued, they remained till the Affair was over. <HI>John Lilly</HI> was attacked by some of the Russians, who gave him three deep Cuts on the Head with a Broad Sword, one of which knocked him down; but recovering himself pretty soon; he strug∣gled with one of the Fellows and pushed him into a Window, and then rushed out at the Street Door through the Midst of a Party of five or six more of the Ruffians that guarded it, in Order to alarm the Neighbours; to prevent which two of their Number pursued him, the rest crying out to them, <HI>Damn him; shoot him; don't let him escape.</HI> But they did not overtake him. And <HI>William Fontaine,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Servant, who was waiting upon him at Supper at the Time of this Assault, was pursued by one of them with a naked Broad-Sword in his Hand into the Gallery: There he escaped the Fury of his Pursuer by leaping down from the Gallery into the Yard through some of the broken Rails. The Stroke aimed at him by his Pursuer fell upon the Rails of the Gallery, and, as he believed, upon his Coat, as he afterwards found it had been cut.</P>
<P>Such, Gentlemen, were the Circumstances of this tragical Affair. Before I proceed to lay the Proofs of them before you, I will beg leave to mention a few Observations concerning the Nature of the Charges contained in the Indictment.</P>
<P>The first Charge in the Indictment is for a well known and very high Offence at the Common Law, called a Burglary; which con∣sists in breaking; and entering; a Man's House in the Night time with an Intent to Commit a Felony. In the present Case it is charged that the Felony intended to be committed was a Murder, of which I be∣lieve, when you have heard the Proofs of the Particulars I have opened to you, you will have little Room to doubt. If this Inten∣tion in the Russians who assaulted Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> is proved to your Satisfaction, together with the Presence of the Prisoner at the Bar at this Transaction, you must find him guilty of this first Charge in the Indictment, which will render the Consideration of the second
<PB N="20" REF="010958_0011_0F852F2E5C456958"/>
Charge of less Importance. But if it should appear to you that the Prisoner was concerned in this Affair, but that there was no Inten∣tion to murder Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> (though this is what I cannot well sup∣pose) the Prisoner must be acquitted upon the first Charge, and found guilty only upon the Second.</P>
<P>The second Charge is founded upon the famous Act of Parlia∣ment for preventing malicious Maiming and Mutilation, passed in the 22d. Year of CHARLES the II. and usually known by the Name of the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> from the brave Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> whose Suf∣ferings were the Occasion of making it. Concerning this Act of Par∣liament two very strange Opinions have been entertained by some Persons in this Province: The First is, that the Act of Parliament is not in Force in this Province; the Second, that, supposing it to be in Force here, the Injury done to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> does not fall within it. I will endeavour to shew the Falshood of both these Opinions.</P>
<P>It has been said in Support of the First of these Opinions, that this Law is not in Force in the other Provinces of <HI>North-America,</HI> and therefore ought not to be so here. This Conclusion is by no Means just. This Province has nothing to do with the other Pro∣vinces of <HI>North-America;</HI> nor indeed have those other Provinces any Connection with each other. The Laws in each Province are different from those in every other, as the different Acts of their Assemblies (which have exercised a Legislative Authority in them) and the different Dates of their original Settlement by <HI>English</HI> Plan∣ters have contributed to vary them. And the Laws of all the Colo∣nies are, from the same Causes, different from the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> itself. The common Principle, upon which they all seem to be established, I apprehend to be this; that every Set of <HI>English</HI> Planters, upon their first occupying and settling a new Colony, have carried with them the Laws of <HI>England</HI> then in Force at the Time of their leaving it to go to the new Colony: That this is the original System of Laws which they imported into the new Colony; and that this System was increased or varied either by new Acts of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament passed since the Settlement of the Colony, contain∣ing express Words extending to it, or by the Acts of their own As∣semblies under the Powers communicated to them by the Royal Charters. Thus the Laws of <HI>England</HI> in Force in the Reign of JAMES the I will be the Basis of the Laws of a Colony that was first settled in his Reign: And in such a Colony the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> which was made in the Reign of CHARLES II. will not of Necessity be a Part of the Law of the Colony, because that Act does not expressly mention the Colonies: It will therefore be, or not be, a Part of the Laws of such a Colony according as their Governor, Council, and Assembly shall have, or have not, adopted it, sup∣posing that those provincial Legislatures have a legal Power to make Laws of that high Importance. And thus it may happen that
<PB N="21" REF="010958_0011_0F852F2E5C456958"/>
some of the <HI>North-American</HI> Colonies this Law may be in Force, and not in others. Whether in Fact it is in Force in any of them, we need not here inquire. With Respect to this Province, it is cer∣tain that this excellent Act of Parliament is as much in Force here as Magna Charta, or the Petition of Right, or the Law of HENRY VIII. that takes the Benefit of the Clergy from Wilful murder of Malice aforethought, or any other the most useful or most respected Laws of <HI>England:</HI> For it is founded on the same Authority with them, namely, the Authority of the great Ordinance of the Legisla∣ture of this Country, General MURRAY and his Council, of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> 17, 1764, by which they introduced into this Province, at one Stroke, the whole System of the Laws of <HI>England</HI> then in Force, and consequently among the rest this excellent Act of Parliament. That Ordinance institutes the present Court of King's-Bench, or Supreme Court of Judicature, in which we are now assembled, and ordains that the Chief-Justice of the Province, who presides in it, shall hear and determine all criminal and civil Causes agreeable to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which certainly must mean the Laws of <HI>England</HI> then in Being. And besides, the Chief-Justice's Commis∣sion, which you have heard read, runs in the same Style with this Ordinance, and directs him to hear and determine all Matters that come before him agreeably to the Laws of <HI>England</HI> and the Ordinan∣ces of this Province hereafter to be made. Either therefore this great Ordinance (upon which all the Proceedings of the Courts of Judicature in the Province, both civil and criminal, have been founded ever since the passing it) and likewise the Directions con∣tained in the King's Commission to the Chief-Justice, are void and of no Authority, and none of the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are now in Force in this Province, but the <HI>French</HI> Laws that prevailed here be∣fore the Conquest are the only Laws that are really still in Force (as they certainly would have been if this Ordinance had not been made) or it must be allowed that this excellent and beneficial Law, called the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> was introduced here by that Ordinance, to∣gether with all the otter Laws of <HI>England</HI> in Being at the Time of passing it.</P>
<P>The second Opinion, that the Injury done to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> does not come within the <HI>Coventry-Act,</HI> though not so intirely destitute of all Colour of Reason as the former Opinion, will yet, I believe, upon Examination appear to be ill-grounded. The <HI>Coventry-Act</HI> says, that, whoever shall on purpose, and of Malice-aforethought, cut or disable the Tongue, put out an Eye, slit the Nose, cut off a nose or Lip, or cut off or disable any Limb, or Member, of any Subject, with In∣tention in so doing to maim or disfigure him, shall be guilty of Felo∣ny without Benefit of Clergy. These are the Words of the Act, in which it is certain the Cutting off an Ear is not mentioned. But Gentlemen, is it not plainly comprehended within the Word <HI>Mem∣ber?</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="010958_0012_0F852F2ECFB85678"/>
To what Purpose, after enumerating the several Features of the Face, does the Statute add the Words <HI>Limb or Member,</HI> unless it be to extend its Protection to all the other Organs of the Body by using the most general and comprehensive Words the Language affords. Certainly by the Word <HI>Limb</HI> we must understand the lar∣ger Parts of the human Body that are seperate from the Trunk, namely, the Arms and Legs, and perhaps the Hands and Feet, and by the Word <HI>Member</HI> the smaller Parts of it, such as the Fin∣gers, and particularly the Ears, as being more likely to be the Object of a malicious Intention to disfigure by Reason of the Resemblance of such an Injury to a disgraceful Punishment in some Cases in∣flicted by the Law; which is the very Sort of Injury this Statute was intended to prevent.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, this Act of Parliament has always been reckoned a most excellent and salutary Law. It was passed in Opposition to the Court, as a Law of indespensable Importance, in the peaceable Part of the Reign of King CEAELES the II. in Consequence of a base piece of Cruelty committed upon Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> a Member of Parliament at that Time, by assaulting him in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, and slitting his Nostrils. This was done, as it is generally supposed, at the Instigation of the Court, and probably of the King himself, in Revenge for some light Expressions thrown out By Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> in a Debate in Parliament, reflecting on the King's known Debauchery. Yet notwithstanding the Provocation given by this personal Reflection on the King, the Parliament thought this barbarous Assault such a flagrant Violation of all the Rules of Justice and Humanity, that they immediately prepared a Bill to ren∣der the Perpetrators of it incapable of receiving the King's Pardon, and to make all future Offenders in the like Kind liable to be punished with Death; and to this Bill the King gave the Royal As∣sent. And it must be observed, that the Parliament that did this was not a factious ill-disposed Parliament, that took a Pleasure in proposing Things that might be disgustful to the Court; but it was that Parliament which, of all that ever sat in <HI>England,</HI> was most devoted to the Crown, and disposed to concur in almost every Mo∣tion and Proposition that came from it—which had repeatedly supplied that King with large Sums of Money, notwithstanding the continual Waste and Misapplication of them, and which, to gratify the Pride and Revenge of his first Minister, the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and the rest of the vindictive Royalists that had returned from Ex∣ile, had passed several penal Laws (which still subsist) to prosecute the Protestant Dissenters, had repealed the excellent Act obtained with so much Difficulty from CHARLES the I. for securing to the Nation a Meeting of Parliament at least once in three Years, and had almost established passive Obedience by a Law. Yet even this compliant Parliament thought this a necessary Law—so necessary
<PB N="23" REF="010958_0012_0F852F2ECFB85678"/>
as to insist upon the passing it in Opposition to the Wishes of the Court. And ever since that Time it has met with the universal Ap∣probation of all the <HI>English</HI> Nation, and has received so much Countenance from the Judges, and been deemed so highly remedial and beneficial to the Subject, that in the only two Cases that have happened upon it (one of which happened about a Year and a Half ago, and the other was the well known Case of <HI>Cook</HI> and <HI>Woodburn</HI>) it has met with a large and liberal Construction. This I am sure of, that neither of those Cases comes so clearly within the Spirit and Meaning of the <HI>Coventry-Act</HI> as the Case now before you does, which seems indeed to be the very Sort of Outrage that Act was designed to guard against: And it seems likewise to come within the Letter of it by giving the Word <HI>Member</HI> used in the Statute, that, I will not say, liberal, but natural Interpretation that has been already mentioned. But these Considerations will, as I apprehend, become of little Consequence by the strong Proofs by which, I doubt not, you will be convinced that at the Time of committing the Assault the Ruffians who committing it had an Intention to murder Mr. <HI>Walker.</HI> I will now, Gentlemen, call the Witnesses for the Crown in Support of this Indictment, without trespassing any longer on your Patience.</P>

<P>ON the sixth Day of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI> about Half after Eight or near Nine of the Clock Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> looked at her Watch, and in about fifteen Minutes after were called out to Supper; as we were sitting at Supper, I with my Back to the Street Door, heard a Noise at the Latch, like somebody wanting to come in in a Hurry, on which Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> being at the Head of the Table, said, <HI>entrez;</HI> the outward Door was thrown open, and through the inner Glass Door I saw a great Number of People disguised, their Heads ap∣peared one above another as they stood on the Steps (such as those in Court, pointing to a Number of People) They were disguised many different Ways, some of them little round Hats, others black Faces, others with Crapes, and one with a <HI>Tuck</HI> of the Hair over the Cap and turn'd in at Top; they burst the inner Door coming in, and broke the Glass, forcing the Bolts of the Door; I turned my Head round on Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s saying, <HI>Good God, what's this, This is Murder!</HI> I took so much Notice of two Faces that were black'd that I should know them if I was to see them again; but they were not any of those Gentlemen in

Custody; have the Idea of them as of a Face drawn with a Pencil; had a distinct View of them. Many of them surrounded as if they would cut off the Communi∣cation of the Parlour. On turn∣ing round. I received a Stroke on my Head. At that Time I could not tell whether it was a Broad Sword or Bludgeon. When I had received this Stroke I rose up and passed through them to get into the Parlour, in order to pass through it into my Bed-Room, where my Sword and Pistols were, in order to make some Defence. I then received many Blows (but cannot tell how many) Passing through the Parlour Door, they following me in such a Hurry, burst open the Standing-door (they were Folding-doors) being so many of them. Coming to the further End of the Room, and striving to get into my Bed-Room, two Men stood at the Chamber Door, and fore-closing me, pre∣vented my opening it; beat me so much, and with such a Number of Strokes. They closed me round with a Curtain, which I suppose prevented their Dashing my Brains out. Was some Time in the Cor∣ner, but how many Blows I re∣ceived there, cannot tell. But there was Fifty-two Contusions or Bruises. I was swelled from the Shoulders to the Fingers End, there was not a free Part all over my Body. I received a Wound on my Leg, but don't know when. Whilst in the Corner I had no Remembrance of being off my Feet; but seeing the Marks of my bloody Head against the Wall imagine I had lost my Senses; but remember hearing a Person say, <HI>let me come to him, I will dispatch the Villain with my Sword;</HI> this was the first Thing I heard; and that roused me, and then was de∣termined to sell my Life as dear as possible. Having seen Major <HI>Disney,</HI> not knowing that I had ever disobliged him, I expected Life, till I heard those Words. Major <HI>Disney</HI> had a Crape on his Face, and I discovered his Face through the Crape. Believe by the Figure that it was he that made use of those Words, having seen him in the Room before I received so many Blows, but I cannot say positively that I knew his Voice, and do not recollect particularly what Dress he was in. Before I received any Blows, or any Thing in the outward Room, I was ful∣ly convinced that was Major <HI>Dis∣ney.</HI> A Person made at me and I parried the Blow with my left Hand and struck at him. At the Instant the Words were pro∣nounced two or three People came up to me with Swords levelled, but do not know whether any Body made a Pass at me or not, but upon my taking Courage they retreated back: My Eyes were then full of Blood. They then closed; one collared me; I seized and held him, till another took me by the right Thigh, and strove to lift me and set me on the Fire, I then turned myself round setting my Hands against the Chim∣ney (the Marks of my five bloody Fingers are on the Jambs of the Chimney) and tore the Side of my Shoe with the Force, and in turn∣ing round I received a Stroke (which the Doctor said was that of a
<PB N="25" REF="010958_0013_0F852F35E9804098"/>
Tomahawk) which fell'd me to the Ground, senseless; how long I laid there cannot tell. The first Remembrance after that Stroke was a severe Blow on my Loins, whether by a Tomahawke or Bludgeon, I do not know, but feel it to this Day in bad weather. After that Blow a Man kneel'd, or sat on my right Side, and I felt as if he was attempting to cut my Throat; I then moved my Head and Shoulders and put any Hand up, thinking it was his Thumb, but found a sharp Instru∣ment. And he cut the little Fin∣ger of my left Hand to the Bone; and it was a Fortnight before I knew that I had lost my Ear. I thought they had aimed to cut my Throat, and thought (at the Time) they had done it. Af∣ter receiving that Wound I heard a Voice from one of those Peo∣ple present say, <HI>the Villain's dead;</HI> another said, <HI>damn him, we have done for him.</HI> A third Person spoke, but I could not rightly understand what he said, but heard some Words; then having lost my Sens∣es can give no further Account; but when I did recollect found my∣self in the Arms of <HI>William Fon∣taine</HI> my Servant, and one Mr. <HI>Pistolet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The bloody Clothes, Shirt, and the Ear in Spirits were then brought into Court and exposed.</HI></P>

<TRAILER>The End of the Prisoner's Evidence.</TRAILER>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="reply">
<HEAD>After the Prisoner's Council had closed the Evidence in his Defence, the Attorney-General made a Reply, to nearly the following Purport, but less fully and with less Warmth.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>'May it please your Honour, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Beg leave to trouble you with a few Observations upon the Evi∣dence that has been produced in the Prisoner's Defence. This Defence seems to consists of two Parts, The one is an Attempt to prove that the Prisoner was engaged in Company at Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s House, during the Time of the Assault upon Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and consequently that he could not be present at it; the other is an Endeavour to discredit the Witness <HI>Magovock,</HI> by suggesting that there are Contradictions in his Evidence, and making him pass for a Man of a bad general Cha∣racter.—This, I think, is the Plan and Substance of the Defence.</P>
<P>"As to the first Part of this Defence, the Presence of the Prisoner, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another Place, I must begin by observing, that it is always looked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on as the worst and weakest Kind of Evidence that can be made use <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Defence of an accused Person, and is seldom allowed to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Weight in Opposition to a positive Charge, supported by witnesses of Credit: And this for a very obvious Reason, because it the easiest of any Sort of Evidence to be contrived by the Friends of
<PB N="54" REF="010958_0028_0F852F424F1F5A68"/>
the Prisoner in order to save him, if they are Persons, as too often is the Case, whose Attachment to his Welfare will lead them to trans∣gress the Bounds of Truth in his Behalf. To make this Kind of Evi∣dence in any Degree satisfactory, it is necessary that several strong Circumstances should concur. The Witnesses, who testify the Pre∣sence of the Prisoner at another Place at the Time of the Commission of the Crime, ought to be Persons of undoubted Credit, free from any Connections with the Prisoner (whether of Kindred, or Friend∣ship, or Interest of any Kind) that may in the lead tend to biass them in his Favour; the Place at which they saw him ought to be far dis∣tant from that where the Crime was committed, so far distant that it should be impossible, or next to impossible, for a Man to go from the one Place to the other in the Time between the Commission of the Crime and his being seen at the other place: This Place ought likewise to be a public Place, where People who have no personal Acquaintance with each other meet by Accident, and the Persons who attest the having seen him there should be Persons unconnected and unacquaint∣ed with each other, as well as with the Prisoner. This would be a Proof of an Alibi that would deserve considerable Regard. Thus, if Captain <HI>Disney</HI> had been proved to be at <HI>Quebec,</HI> which is 180 Miles distant from <HI>Montreal,</HI> at the Time of committing this Assault, or within a few Hours, or half a Day, of that Time—and this, not by one or two Friends, who should say that they saw him there that Day in private, but by Witnesses that had no particular Acquaintance with him, and who should testify that they saw him at some public Place there, as, for Example, on the Parade exercising the Soldiers, or on the Mar∣ket-place, or at Dinner with a numerous Company at the Gover∣nor's Table; and if the Witnesses who had sworn this should likewise tell you to what Cause or particular Circumstances it was owing that they could remember their having seen him there on the Day of this Assault, when they, probably, are not able to recollect on what Day they saw him immediately before, or immediately after, it— Such a Testimony would really be important, and might perhaps deserve to be set in Opposition to the positive Evidence of the Wit∣nesses in Support of the Charge.—But how different from this is the Alibi Evidence that you have heard! Three Ladies, and Dr. <HI>Robertson,</HI> have told you that Captain <HI>Disney</HI> spent the Afternoon and Evening with them a Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s House in <HI>Montreal,</HI> not two Hundred Yards distant from Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s House. Two of those La∣dies Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Campbell,</HI> are the Wives of two of the Prisoners now in Custody for this Affair; and the latter is likewise the Daughter of another of those Prisoners. The other Lady, Mrs. <HI>Landrieves,</HI> is a very intimate Acquaintance and Friend of Capt. <HI>Dis∣ney</HI>'s. And Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI> has given strong Proofs of his eager De∣sire to get both this and all the other Prisoners for this Affair dischar∣ged, and has gone much greater Lengths for this Purpose than the
<PB N="55" REF="010958_0028_0F852F424F1F5A68"/>
mere Love of Justice and a Concern for accused Persons, apprehend∣ed to be innocent, usually carries Men to: He has, since the Chief-Justice has been in the Town holding the Sessions of the Supreme-Court, been busily exercising his Office of a Justice of Peace with Respect to this Affair, by taking Depositions relating to it. I leave it to him to explain, or to you to conjecture, whether he could have any other Design in doing so, than to influence, in a clandestine Man∣ner, the Minds of Men in Favour of these Prisoners, by setting up a Parcel of private Evidences taken thus before him, in Opposition both to that which should be offered to the Grand-Jury, and to that which should be given here publickly in Court before you, Gentle∣men, in Support of the Prosecution. One of the Persons whom he has thus examined, has since made Oath before the Chief-Justice, in my Presence, that he had been thus examined, upon Oath, by this very Zealous Magistrate. Such, Gentlemen, are the Witnesses that are brought to support this Alibi.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, these Witnesses have not told to you to what particu∣lar Circumstance it is owing that they remember so exactly the Man∣ner in which they spent their Time on the 6th of <HI>December,</HI> 1764; without which it must needs appear strange that they should remem∣ber it so exactly. Can they tell where and in what Company, and in what Manner they spent their Time on the 6th of <HI>December,</HI> 1765, or even on the 6th of last <HI>December,</HI> though only three Months past? —Or can you, Gentlemen, those of you that were then in <HI>Montreal,</HI> remember distinctly where and how you spent your Afternoon and Evening on that very same 6th of <HI>December,</HI> 1764? If you cannot, is it not somewhat surprising that these Witnesses should be able to do it so exactly, without some particular Circumstance to induce them to take Notice at the Time, or soon after, of the Manner in which they spent that Day? This Circumstance I should have been glad to be informed of.—Was it that they suspected that Captain <HI>Disney</HI> or Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> or Captain <HI>Campbell,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Simon Evans,</HI> or any other Person in that Company at Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s, would ever be ac∣cused or questioned about this Assault upon Mr. <HI>Walker?</HI>— Such an early Suspicion, Gentlemen, would, in my Opinion, have been no small Presumption that some of that Company were guilty of it.—What other Conjecture to form concerning the Cause of their remembering so well the Manner and Company in which they spent that Day I know not.—'Tis certain they have help'd us to no other.</P>
<P>'But Gentlemen, other Things in their Evidence afford Matter of Surprise. They not only remember of what Persons the Company consisted, and how they spent their Time, but declare that they are confident that Captain <HI>Disney</HI> was present in the Company during the whole Time that each of themselves was present there, though that Time was near five Hours.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, this bold Assertion deserves to be examined, in or∣der
<PB N="56" REF="010958_0029_0F852F45E2F5D828"/>
that you may fully understand it, and assign to it its proper De∣gree of Credit, which I believe you will judge to be but little. It may be understood in two different Senses: It may mean either that these Witnesses in their Eyes continually fixed upon Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> so that he never was out of their Sight and Observation during the whole five hours, which would indeed be a positive Assertion absolutely in∣consistent with the Charge; or it may mean that they did not indeed keep the Prisoner continually in their Sight during that whole Time, but only that they saw him there at several different Times during their being together, and that they did not miss him or observe that he quitted the Company during that whole Time; and therefore that they, by Inference, conclude that he did not quit it, because, if he had done so, they think it highly probable that they must have taken Notice of it.—'Tis in this latter Sense the Evidence of these Witnes∣ses, must be taken: The other is too bold, or rather desperate, a Kind of Evidence for any People to deliver in a Court of Justice with any Expectation of being believed: And accordingly you must have ob∣served, Gentlemen, that when the first Witness was asked whether she had her Eyes fixt continually upon Captain <HI>Disney</HI> during the whole Time (which she must have said if she had meant positively to af∣firm that he was there the whole Time) she readily answered that she did not keep her Eyes thus continually fixed upon him, but that she saw him there very often, and never observed that he left the Com∣pany, which she says she could not but have done if he had ever left them, because the Company was but small: And the other Wit∣nesses answered in the same Manner. Now this is not a positive As∣sertion that Captain <HI>Disney</HI> was there all the Time: It is only a ne∣gative Proposition, or a Declaration that they did not observe him to leave the Company in all that Time, which is a very different Thing. For, Gentlemen. This Declaration, that they never observ∣ed him leave the Company, may be true, and yet the Inference they would draw from it, that he never left it, may not be so: He may have left the Company more than once, and they not have observed it, especially for so small a Time as five or six Minutes, which is suf∣ficient for his attending a Transaction that happened only at the Dis∣tance of Two Hundred Yards from the Place where the Company was assembled, And therefore, Gentlemen, the Evidence of these Witnesses, supposing it to be strictly true, does not positively prove the Prisoner's Alibi, but only gives Room for a probable Inference in Support of it, which being but a Presumption, ought not to be set in Opposition to the positive Testimony of three Witnesses in Support of the Charge against him.</P>
<P>'But, Gentlemen, we may go still further. This Evidence of the Prisoner's Alibi is not even a <HI>very strong</HI> Presumption. For where is the great Improbability of a Person's absenting himself once or twice from a Company of eleven Persons (which was the Number
<PB N="57" REF="010958_0029_0F852F45E2F5D828"/>
assembled at Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s) for a short space of Time, such as five or ten Minutes, without being observed by the other Persons in the Com∣pany, and that too with such particular Attention that they shall be able to recollect it a long Time after?—Such a Want of Ob∣servation of the Motions of the rest of the Company, as not to recollect such little Absences of some one of them, is surely by no Means un∣common. Gentlemen, I appeal to yourselves, whether when you happen to be in a Company of a Dozen People for five Hours together, who are met together for the Sake of Mirth and Amusement, you are apt to watch each Person in the Company so very carefully that you can falsely declare afterwards, upon Oath, which of them absented himself from the Company for a little While, and which did not, and can be sure that during the whole Time such or such a particu∣lar Person of the Company never left it, even for the Space of five or ten Minutes? Gentlemen, is it your Custom to watch your Company so narrowly: I believe I may say that it is not.—And in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present Case is not the Difficulty of observing and remembering <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Particulars increased by the Variety of Pastimes with which this Com∣pany amused themselves?—They were not all the while en∣gaged in Parties at Cards, or in dancing, in which Case they might perhaps observe what became of their Partners and the others engaged at play with them: But they spent Part of the Time in making Syrup, Part of it in dancing, Part of it drinking Tea, and Part of it, Gentle∣men (which is worthy your Attention) in playing at Blind-man's-buff. Can they be supposed, during all those different Amusements to have been so very watchful of each other? They should at least have ex∣cepted those parts of the Time they were playing at Blind-man's-buff, during which they acted the part of the blind-Man.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, I could not but admire the Rapidity and the Positiveness with which some of these Witnesses delivered their Evidence, particu∣larly the first Witness. The Answer was ready almost before the Question was pronounced. I believe she never repeated her Creed or her Catechism more readily or nimbly. She told you the exact Times at which each different Amusement began, as readily and precisely as if she had been reading an Account of them from Minutes of that Af∣ternoon's Entertainment taken down at the Time. One Thing only escaped her uncommon Memory, till she was induced to reccollect it, by a positive Question put to her concerning it. This was that she herself was absent from the Company for Part of the Time this Com∣pany has been said to continue together. Gentlemen, this Circum∣stance she forgot to tell you in her original Account: it was drawn from her in the Cross-examination. But when she did declare it, I make no Doubt, Gentlemen, that you observed the great Importance of it. Gentlemen, it tends to nothing less than to make her Evidence and that of Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> (who was absent with her for that little Time) I say, it tends to nothing less than to make the Evidence of both these
<PB N="58" REF="010958_0030_0F852F4693686A10"/>
Witnesses (admitting it all to be strictly true) of little or no Effect in supporting the Prisoner's Alibi. For observe only the Time of this Absence. This Witness and Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> have both of them told you that it happend about three Quarters of an Hour after Eight o'Clock, that is, as near as can be judged, at the very Time of the Assault com∣mitted upon Mr. <HI>Walker.</HI> Just at this critical Time they left the Com∣pany and went to Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI>'s House for a Table-Cloth, leaving the Company employed in no common Amusement, such as Cards or Dancing, that might require the Presence of them all, but fitting round the Stove till the Supper should be ready: They staid away some little Time, which they think was about five Minutes, and then returned to Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s. Gentlemen, this Time of their Absence may not improbably be a good deal more than five Minutes—per∣haps a Quarter of an Hour, or twenty Minutes. Such Mistakes in the Measure of Time happen every Day, where People judge of it without looking at a Watch, as these Ladies have declared that they did.</P>
<P>'In this small Space of Time it was possible, for aught that is con∣tained in the Evidence of these two Ladies, for Captain <HI>Disney</HI> to have have quitted the Company and stept Home to his Lodging, and, there making the little Alteration in his Dress which was necessary to disguise him, to have gone into Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s House, and been present for two or three Minutes during the Assault upon him, to overlook and encourage the Persons employed in it. The change of Dress for this Purpose would take up a very short Time. It was only throwing off his Coat, and flipping on a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown instead of it, and put∣ting a Crape over his Face and a cut-round Hat upon his Head with the Crape tucked in under it. This was the only Change made in his Dress from that in which he appeared at Dr, <HI>Robertson</HI>'s: For the Pri∣soner's Witnesses have told you that he was that Day dressed in Scarlet and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> observed that he had a red Waistcoat and red Breeches under his <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown.</P>
<P>'This slight Change of his Dress he might easily make, and be present at Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s House, for a few Minutes, then change his Dress again and return to Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s, in the Compass of a very small Time. We may therefore consider the Evidence of those two Ladies as contributing very little to support the Prisoner's Alibi. It it must therefore rest principally upon the Testimony of Mrs. <HI>Campbell,</HI> a Lady that is the Wife of one, and the Daughter of another of the Prisoner's now in Custody for this Assault, and that of the very friendly Dr. <HI>Robertson,</HI> whose Zeal in the Defence of these Gentlemen has been so great as to lead him to take Depositions concerning this Affair, even since the Chief-Justice has been here in Town to hold this Session.</P>
<P>'Such, Gentlemen, is the Alibi to which you are desired to give Credit: An Alibi declaring the Prisoner to have been at a Place not Two Hundred Yards distant from the Scene of the Offence. Pretended to

be proved by four Witnesses, but in Truth not positively proved by any one of them, (none of them swearing that they had the Prisoner con∣tinually in Sight during the whole Time they were together) but grounded upon a Presumption only, and not a very strong one, that, if he had quitted the Room, though for a very small Space of Time, as five or ten Minutes, during any Part of the five Fours they were toge∣ther, they must have taken Notice of it.—And even this poor Presumption is found, upon a Cross-Examination, to be supported by only two of these Witnesses, the other two having confessed that they themselves were absent from the Company for a little Time, just at the critical Juncture of the Commission of the Crime—And this Proof, imperfect as it is, made by Witnesses under a strong and evi∣dent Biass in the Prisoner's Favour. This wretched Alibi you are re∣quired to believe in opposition to the positive Testimony of three Wit∣nesses, two of whom are Persons of unblemished Character, and per∣fectly free from Prejudice against the Prisoner, and the third was an Accomplice in the Fact. You cannot, Gentlemen, remain long in Doubt which of these two Testimonies to prefer.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, I have said that Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> are perfectly free from Prejudice against the Prisoner. I will explain what I mean by that Assertion. It cannot be pretended that they are free from Resentment against the Prisoner: They must be exempt from human Passions if they were: But their Resentment arises merely from this very Injury with which he is now charged, and from their own certain Knowledge of his concern in it. That, and the Prisoner's Declaration before-hand, That he would be revenged upon Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> for his Ill-treatment of Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> are the only Grounds that Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> has for any Resentment against Captain <HI>Disney.</HI> And such a Resent∣ment cannot be called a Prejudice against Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> or in any Degree affect the Credibility of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence or this Occasion, because the very Existence of such a Resentment supposes necessarily that of the Crime with which the Prisoner stands charged as the Cause and Ground of it. It might indeed affect Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence on any other Prosecution against Captain <HI>Disney,</HI> either for an Injury done to another Man, or for another Injury done to himself: But in the present Case it cannot have any such Effect. Till this unhappy Vio∣lence, or a very little Time before it, Captain <HI>Disney</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> had lived upon good Terms with each other. Captain <HI>Disney</HI> himself has informed you that he did so: He has declared that he always en∣tertained a Respect for Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> (that, I think, was his Expression) and expressed it in Coversation whenever he had Occasion to speak of him: And he has called a Witness to prove that he did so. And Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> has told you that he trusted so much to the Professions of Re∣gard that Captain <HI>Disney</HI> had often made him, and was so conscious in his own Mind of his never having given him any Cause of Offence, that, when he distinguished him among the disguised Ruffians that
<PB N="60" REF="010958_0031_0F852F4799BE6888"/>
were come to assaut him, he was encouraged by the Sight of him to hope that his Life was not in Danger, and that the Mischief intended him was only a severe Beating, or Wounding, or something short of Death, in Revenge for the imaginary Insult upon Captain <HI>Payne,</HI> till he was forced to think otherwise by those dreadful and murderous Words, pronounced from the opposite Corner of the Room by the Man who advanced against him with a drawn Sword, <HI>Damn him, let me come to him, and I'll dispatch him with my Sword.</HI></P>
<P>'Gentlemen, this Evidence of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> appears to me to be so weighty, that' if the Alibi Defence of the Prisoner had been supported by positive Evidence absolutely inconsistent with the Charge —if not two only, but all the four Witnesses had positively sworn, that at eight o'Clock exactly they had sat down to play at Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with the Prisoner, and that they had never left the Table till the Mes∣senger came from General <HI>Burton</HI> with the News of the Outrage com∣mitted upon Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> but had been all the While either at the Table playing themselves, or near it, looking on upon those who did play, and that the Prisoner had never cut out, but had been one of the Players during the whole of that Time, so that he must have been con∣tinually before their Eyes.—and if the Persons who testified this had not been the intimate Friends of the Prisoner, or the Wives and Daughters of the other Prisoners, but Persons entirely unconnected, and very little acquainted, with them—I say, Gentlemen, that is the alibi Defence of the Prisoner had been supported by such a posi∣tive Testimony instead of the imperfect and precarious Evidence which you have heard, yet still the Evidence in Support of the Charge would deserve to be preferred to it.—This may, at first Sight, seem a harsh Position: But it will be found upon Examination to be built upon a Principle of Candour and Charity, which directs us to think as fa∣vourable of human Nature as the Circumstances of the Case will per∣mit us. Gentlemen, it would be a bad Dilemma for you to be reduced to, if you were really under a Necessity of disbelieving the Witnesses on one Side or other, and consequently of supposing those on one of the Sides to be guilty of wilful Perjury. But if you were reduced to this Dilemma, to which Side would a moderately good Opinion of human induce you to impute the Perjury? To those who give Evidence to take away the Prisoner's life or to those who give Evidence to save it? Is it not more natural that Men should commit Perjury to rescue a Man from Danger than in order to effect his Destruction? In the former Case they may think perhaps that the Benevolence of the Intention with which they commit this Crime may somewhat extenuate the Guilt of it; in the latter Case they must feel that the Guilt of the Perjury is aggravated an Hundred-fold by the Wickedness of the Intention with with it is committed. The former is a Crime which Men of loose Principles may be supposed capable of committing, and which indeed is very frequently committed; the latter is a Crime too black for even
<PB N="61" REF="010958_0031_0F852F4799BE6888"/>
wicked Men, and seldom or never known to have been practised.— But, Gentlemen, you are fortunately not reduced to this Dilemma, since the Evidence advanced in the Prisoner's Favour has been shewn to be not irreconcileable with the Evidence in support of the Charge. The Prisoner may have spent that Evening in the Company of his three fair Witnesses, and yet have been absent for a short Time to partake in the Revenge taken against Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> without being missed by them.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, that the Prisoner spent that Evening either in the Company at Dr. <HI>Robertson</HI>'s, or in some other numerous Company. I think is highly probable. I should have imagined he had done so if he had produced no Witnesses to prove it: For it is but a reasonable Precaution for any Man to take, who intends to be concerned in any dangerous Transaction, for which he may afterwards come to be ques∣tioned. He thereby furnishes himself with a ready Defence against any Accusation of having been engaged in it that happens to be made in a loose and general Manner, without narrowly enquiring into Circum∣stances. How can it be supposed, will he say, that I was present at such a Transaction, when such and such Persons can testify that much about the Time at which it happened, or at least not above half an Hour or an Hour, before or after it, I was in their Company, employed in Dancing or some other such innocent Amusement." such a Defence will do very well to answer the Suspicions and Hints thrown out against him in common Conversation, and will pass with many People for a full Justification; and, perhaps, with a little Improvement (if the Witnesses are well disposed towards the Prisoner) by varying the Time and other Circumstances in the Manner requisite, it may meet with Credit even in a Court of Justice; whereas, if he had spent his Time at Home in a solitary Manner till the Time of committing the Crime, he could have nothing of this Kind to set up in Opposition to the Tes∣timony in support of the Charge against him.</P>
<P>'These, Gentlemen, are the Observations I thought it necessary to offer to you concerning this boasted Evidence of the Prisoner's Alibi, which makes the principal Part of his Defence. I am sensible they have taken up too much of your Time; but I knew not how to make them shorter. I hope therefore you will excuse this Prolixity, and at the same Time will further indulge me with leave to make a few Remarks on the second Part of the Prisoner's Defence, which consists in an En∣deavour to discredit the Witness <HI>Magovock.</HI></P>
<P>'Gentlemen, it is of no great Consequence in the present Prosecu∣tion what Degree of Credit this Witness deserves, as the Change is sup∣ported by two Witnesses of indisputable Credit without him. However, I can see no Reason for treating his Evidence with the Contempt which the Gentlemen of Council with the Prisoner have affected to shew for it. He certainly is not a good Man: No Body has pretended that he was so. He owns that he was an Accomplice in this wicked Action, which no good Man could be concerned in: And Lieutenant <HI>Ma Kay</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="010958_0032_0F852F484EB32F00"/>
has said, that, when he knew him in the Army, he was sometimes guilty of Theft, and has been punished for it by a Court Martial. I readily believe this. But does this render what he says as a Witness in a Court Justice of no Weight or Consequence? Does it follow, be∣cause a Soldier has been guilty of Theft, a Crime too common amongst them, that therefore he will be guilty of the great and deliberate Crime (one of the most heinous that can be committed) of swearing falsely in a Court of Justice to take away another Man's Life? Surely it does not: And the Law, Gentlemen, in the Case of Accomplices deter∣mines that it does not: For it allows their Evidence to be received against their Fellow-criminals, nay, to be alone the Ground of a Con∣viction, without any other positive Testimony, provided there is some concomitant Evidence arising from Circumstances to make it probable. Numbers of People have been condemned upon such Evidence, and with the general Approbation of all the World: And there are now in <HI>Quebec</HI> Goal two Soldier under Sentence of Death, for breaking open Mr <HI>Woolsey</HI>'s Cellar in the Night Time, and stealing a Cask of Wine from it, who were convicted upon the single Testimony of an Accomplice with them in the Fact, together with a Proof by Mr. <HI>Woolsey</HI> and his Clerk that the Cellar had been broke open by some∣body or other and the Wine taken away. How much more then does such a Testimony deserve to be regarded when it does not stand single, but is made use of only to confirm the positive Testimony of two other Witnesses of indisputable Credit, which is the Case with the Evidence of this Witness on the present Prosecution.</P>
<P>'Gentlemen, the Credibility of a Witnesses Testimony does not de∣pend merely upon the Goodness of his Character. The Probility of the Story he relates, the Agreement of it with other well-known Facts, the Minuteness and Particularity of the Circumstances he mentions; and his Illiterateness and Ignorance and utter Incapacity to invent them, if he was wicked enough to endeavour to do so, may make his Evidence deserve to be believed by those who have no Oppinion of his Virtue. These, I presume, are some of the Grounds upon which the Law ad∣mits the Evidence of Accomplices, and allows it to have considerable Weight: And these are the Grounds upon which the Evidence of this Witness <HI>Magovock</HI> deserves to be regarded. Gentlemen, can you sup∣pose this Witness, who can neither write nor read,—I say, can you suppose him capable of inventing so long and particular a Story as he has related to you, and which is attended with some Circumstances so uncommon and surprising? Is it likely that he should think of so remarkable a Circumstance as that of the Consultation at Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI>'s House on the Monday preceding the Assault, in which the Prisoner at the Bar administred to him the Oath of Secrecy, unless these Things had really happened? Would he have refused to deliver his whole Evidence about this Matter at once in his first Deposition, if he had not been under the Restraint of such an Oath? Is there any Reason to
<PB N="63" REF="010958_0032_0F852F484EB32F00"/>
suppose that he is so refined and ingenious a Villain, as to able to invent such a Story about an Oath of Secrecy, merely to make himself pass for a Man of some Conscience, and give Credit to the rest of his Evidence? I cannot, for my Part, have either so bad an Opinion of his Heart, or so good an one of his Understanding, as to suppose this: His Testimony therefore deserves the same Degree of Credit as is usually given to the Evidence of Accomplices, notwithstanding the Endeavours that have been used to asperse his general Character. It remains that I make a few Remarks upon the Evidence he has delivered at this Trial, and the Inconsistencies which the Gentlemen of Counsel for the Prisoner have observed between the different Parts of it, and between some Parts of it and the Evidence of some of the other Witnesses.</P>
<P>'One of these Contradictions is, that he said in his Cross-Exami∣nation that he carried the Intelligence concerning the Progress of the Assault upon Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House, whereas he had before said that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> were, during that Assault, standing in the Street in which Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s House is situated, near the House of one <HI>Bellair,</HI> a Baker, which is almost directly over-against Mr. <HI>Wal∣ker</HI>'s House. Gentlemen, I doubt not you must have observed that this Mistake was never made by the Witness, but by the Counsel that cross-examined him, who, throughout the whole Cross-examination, en∣deavoured to confound the Witness and bewilder his Understanding, by asking him a Variety of Questions unconnected with each other and without any Method or Regard to the Order of Time, with a View to draw him in to make sudden Answers that might not be confident with each other. But in this he was disappointed by the Steadiness and Clearness with which the Witness gave his Answers to all the Questions that were put to him. With Respect to the pretended Contradiction now under Consideration, the Witness's Evidence was really as fol∣lows: The Prisoner's Counsel had asked him whether he had seen Captain <HI>Payne</HI> before he went into Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s House, to commit the Assault; to which the Witness answered that he had seen him before at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House, and that they had come out from thence at the same Time. After another Question or two, the Counsel asks him where it was he carried the Intelligence concerning the Progress of the Assault to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham;</HI> and the Witness answers, in the Street near Mr. <HI>Bellair</HI>'s House, which is al∣most over-against Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s. Thereupon the Counsel pretends that this is inconsistent with his former Answer; for that in that he had declared that he had carried the Intelligence concerning the Assault to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House. But the Witness immedi∣ately answered, that the Counsel had greatly mistaken him; for that he had never said any such Thing, but only that he had seen Captain <HI>Payne</HI> before at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House, and that Captain <HI>Payne</HI> had set out with them from that House: And this, Gentlemen, I dare say
<PB N="64" REF="010958_0033_0F852F4F98983420"/>
you observed to have been really his Evidence. Indeed this is a Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦take which it is absurd to suppose he could have made, unless he had been quite a Stranger to <HI>Montreal;</HI> because otherwise he could <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> know that Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House was at too great a Distance from Mr <HI>Walker</HI>'s for a man to have gone thither twice with this Intelligence in the short Space of Time the Assault was carrying on in the Man¦ner he had related; so that, if he had invented the whole Story, he would have assigned some nearer Spot of Ground for the Place <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham</HI> waited to superintend and cover the Assault, and to receive the Intelligence he carried the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerning its Progress. In Truth that Part of Mr. <HI>Waelker</HI>'s Street which was near Mr. <HI>Bellair</HI>'s House, and, within a Dozen Yards of Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s, was the Spot he all along mentioned as the Place <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which he delivered his Intelligence to Captain <HI>Payne</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Tottenham,</HI> both in his Answers to the Questions put to him by the Court and in his Cross-Examination by the Prisoner's Counsel.</P>
<P>'The next Contradiction imputed to him is, a Mistake in Point of Time. He said it was about eight o'Clock, or a little before▪ when the Ruffians left Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House to go to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s to make the Assault, and that it was near nine o'Clock, but not quite nine when the whole Affair was over: And yet he says in another Part of his Evidence that he believes the Assault did not take up above a Quar¦ter of an Hour. Gentlemen, I confess there is this Inaccuracy in the Witness's Evidence, and am desirous that it should have its due Weight with you in the Prisoner's Favour. But can this much avail him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> —Can the Mistake of a poor common Soldier concerning the pre∣cise Time of a Transaction he relates, when he judged of it only by guess and without either Watch or Clock, impeach the Credibility of his Testimony concerning the Transaction itself, when that Testimony is rational and consistent with itself in every other Particular? Certain∣ly Gentlemen, it cannot. Mistakes of half an Hour, or even a whole Hour, are frequently made by Men who observe Time much more carefully than such Persons as the Witness can be supposed to do; and indeed they hardly deserve to be called Mistakes, because the Differ∣ence of Clocks is sufficient to account for them. This seems to me to so usual and natural, that, in my Apprehension, no Evidence whatso∣ever concerning the precise Time of any Action deserves to be much regarded, though delivered by the most respectable Witness, unless the Person who delivers it declares at the same Time that he looked at a Clock or a Watch at the Time the Action happened, or immediately before or after, or else took particular Notice that it happened at the Time with some other regular Transaction that is always carried on at a fixt Hour, such as the ringing of the Bell of a Church or Convent for Morning or Evening Prayers, or some other such remarkable Cir∣cumstance. Without some such Circumstance I can easily imagine that the most honest and judicious Person in the World may mistake
<PB N="65" REF="010958_0033_0F852F4F98983420"/>
a full Hour in the Time of any Transaction he was present at, and should think it a mere chance if he was exact. In the present Case the Witness said he believed it was a little before eight when they set out from Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House to commit the Assault: in which, I am persuaded he mistook the Time by more than half an Hour, for that it must really have been more than half an Hour after eight; at least by Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Clock; because Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> and the Clerk and Servant, who have been examined in support of the Prosecution, fix the Time of the Assault pretty exactly. And where now is the great Wonder that a common Soldier, who had no Watch, and whose Mind was flurried with the thoughts of a dangerous Expedition he was going to be concerned in, and with some strong Liquor he had taken to prepare himself for it should think it was only eight o'Clock when in Truth it was half an Hour or forty Minutes after?—I say, what is there to be sur∣prised at in such a Mistake? More especially when we consider that possibly the Clock at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House, if there was one there, or, if there was not, the Clocks in his Neighbourhood, by which he and his Family had judged of the Course of Time during that Day, might very well be forty Minutes flower than Mr. <HI>Walkers</HI>'s. Surely it deserves very little Consideration. Those triffling Inaccuracies, which may be so easily accounted for, seem to me on the Contrary to add Strength to the Evidence of a Witness rather than to render it less cre∣dible, since they shew that the Witness answers fairly and honestly what his Memory suggests to him, without having artfully framed a regular Story with every Circumstance in exact and perfect Order, that he might guard against the Possibility of a Surprise.</P>
<P>'The next Contradiction insisted on by the Counsel for the Prisoner is that concerning the Prisoner's Dress. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> has said that he was dressed in a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown, and the Witness <HI>Magovock</HI> has said that he was dressed in a Blanket Coat. Gentlemen, there is a real in∣consistency between these Testimonies. But, I believe, you will hardly think it of much Importance. It is easy for <HI>Magovock</HI> to have mistaken the Dress of Major <HI>Disney</HI> amongst the Number of Persons he saw on that Occasion, and yet to be very certain of his Person; as the Person of a Man makes a much stronger Impression upon the Mind and Memo∣ry of a Spectator than his Dress. And it must be remembered that <HI>Macgovoek</HI> has told you that Major <HI>Disney</HI> was not one of the Party that dressed themselves at Sergeant <HI>Mees</HI>'s House, and set out from thence to go to Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s (in which Case it might perhaps be expect∣ed that <HI>Macgovock</HI> should remember his Dress exactly) but was one of the additional Party that came in to assist and protect the former, whose several Dresses it can hardly be supposed that he can recollect with perfect Exactness.</P>
<P>'But, Gentlemen, the main Foundation of this Objection to <HI>Mac∣govock</HI>'s Testimony is by no Means favourable to the Prisoner, as will appear if we consider it a little further. The Objection I take to be as follows: Macgovock's <HI>Evidence concerning Major</HI> Disney<HI>'s Dress is
<PB N="66" REF="010958_0034_0F852F504C238370"/>
cntrary to Mrs.</HI> Walker<HI>'s, and therefore false; and consequently the rest of his Evidence is likewise either false or doubtful.</HI> What then, is it admitted that Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence concerning the Prisoner's Dress on that Occasion is true? Nothing More is wanted on the Part of the Prose∣cution. The Prisoner was present at the Assault in a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown according to Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence; and <HI>Macgovock</HI> has been Mis∣taken in his Dress, and deserves therefore no Credit in any other Part of his Testimony. Let then his whole Evidence be set aside as doubt∣ful and good for nothing, since Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence is thus admit∣ted to be true.—But if Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI>'s Evidence is not allowed to be true—if the Person she saw there in a <HI>Canadian</HI> Gown was not Major <HI>Disney,</HI> but some other Person—then where is the In∣consistency of her Testimony with that of <HI>Magovock</HI>'s? She may have been mistaken in the Person she took for the Major, and yet the Major may have been there in a different Dress, that is, in a Blanket-Coat, ac∣cord to <HI>Macgovock</HI>'s Evidence. The most that can be made of this Ob∣jection, if a mistake about the Prisoner's Dress can be thought to be of such high Importance, is to get rid of the Evidence of one of these two Witnesses; in which Case the Prosecution will rest upon the Evidence of the other of them, and of Mr. <HI>Walker.</HI></P>
<P>'These are, far as I can recollect, the principal Contradictions in the Witness <HI>Magovock</HI>'s Evidence on which the Gentlemen of Counsel with the Prisoner have insisted: And, I presume, Gentlemen, after what has been offered to your Consideration by way of Reply to the Conse∣quences that have been attempted to be drawn from them, that you will be clearly of Opinion that they do not materially affect the Credit of the other Parts of this Witness's Testimony. But, as has been be∣fore observed, the whole Evidence of this Witness might very well be set aside, if there was Reason for it, and yet the remaining Proof in support of the Prosecution would be more than sufficient to be the Ground of a Conviction, being the positive Testimony of two Witnesses of indisputable Credit. Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> who have sworn that they saw the Prisoner in Mr. <HI>Walker</HI>'s House at the Time of the Assault. This is a solid and substantial Proof in support of the Prosecution, which neither the imperfect presumptive Evidence of the Prisoner's Alibi, given by Witnesses strongly byssed in his Favour, and by the Wives and Daughters of Fellow-Prisoners, nor the Mistakes of a third Witness (though they had been as important as they have been shewn to be in∣considerable) can impeach. One Thing only can be alledged to di∣minish the Weight of it and plead somewhat in the Prisoner's Favour, which I doubt not, Gentlemen, has already occured to you: I mean the Circumstance of the Prisoner's being said to have been disguised by a Crape that covered his Face. This, it might be thought, must have made it difficult for Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> to descern the Features of his Face; without which it is possible, and, in Favour of Innocence, might per∣haps be presumed, that they had mistaken some other Man that resem∣bled
<PB N="67" REF="010958_0035_0F852F526DAEB7A8"/>
the Prisoner in Size and Shape to be the Prisoner himself; and that the Hurry of their Spirits on such an alarming Occasion had strengthed the Impression made by such a Resemblance and contributed to confirm them in this Mistake. This is, in my Opinion, the most important Consideration that can be offered in the Prisoner's Favour▪ But, Gentlemen, in answer to it I must observe, that both Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> have sworn that they distinguished the Features of his Face which takes away all Room for such a Mistake. And that it is by no Means difficult to discern a Man's Features through a Crape you will easily be convinced upon trial. Mrs. <HI>Walker</HI> has brought here into Court a Peice of Crape of the same Kind with that which was drawn over the Face of the Man she took to be the Prisoner (and which is of the same Kind that Officers wear upon their Arms for mourning in Order to enable you to make this necessary Trial. Take this with you, Gentlemen, when you withdraw to consider of your Verdict of this important Occasion, and try yourselves how far it is capable of concealing a Person's Features. I believe you will find it to be but a poor Disguise, and will soon be of Opinion that Mrs. <HI>Walker,</HI> at the Distance of about ten Feet, and Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> at that of only four Feet might very well have been able to discern the Features of the Person upon whom they fixed their Eyes to have been those of the Prisoner at the Bar.'</P>
<P>The Attorney-General having ended his Reply, the Chief-Justice summed up the Evidence to the Jury, who, after withdrawing for about half an Hour, brought in their Verdict that the Prisoner was Not Guilty: And the Prisoner was thereupon discharged.</P>
