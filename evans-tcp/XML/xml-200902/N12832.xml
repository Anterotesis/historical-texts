<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>WE sing of Masons antient fame!</L>
<L>Lo, eighty thousand craftsmen rise</L>
<L>Under the Masters of great name,</L>
<L>More than three thousand just and wise.</L>
<L>Employ'd by SOLOMON, the Sire,</L>
<L>And gen'ral Master Mason too,</L>
<L>As HIRAM was in stately Tyre,</L>
<L>Like Salem built by Masons true.</L>

<L>The Royal art was then divine,</L>
<L>The craftsmen counsell'd from above,</L>
<L>The temple was the grand design,</L>
<L>The wond'ring world did all approve.</L>
<L>Ingenious men from every place</L>
<L>Came to survey the glorious pile;</L>
<L>And when return'd, began to trace</L>
<L>And imitate its lofty style.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>At length the Grecians came to know</L>
<L>Geometry, and learn'd the art</L>
<L>Pythagoras was rais'd to show,</L>

<L>But when proud Asia they had quell'd,</L>

<L>Where wise Vitruvius, Warden prime</L>

<L>In great Augustus' peaceful time,</L>
<L>When arts and artists were belov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">

<L>They brought the knowledge from the <HI>east,</HI></L>
<L>And as they made the nations yield,</L>
<L>They spread it through the <HI>north</HI> and <HI>west,</HI></L>
<L>And taught the world the art <HI>to build.</HI></L>
<L>Witness their citadels and tow'rs,</L>
<L>To fortify their legions fine,</L>
<L>Their temples, palaces and bow'rs,</L>
<L>That spoke the Masons grand design.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">

<L>Thus mighty eastern Kings, and some</L>
<L>Of Abraham's race, and Monarchs good</L>

<L>True architecture understood.</L>
<L>No wonder then if Masons join</L>

<L>Whilst every Brother jointly sings.</L>

<L>High honor to Masons the Craft daily brings,</L>

<L>We drove the rude Vandals and Goths off the stage,</L>

<L>TO all who Masonry despise,</L>
<L>This counsel I bestow:</L>
<L>Don't ridicule, if you are wise,</L>
<L>A secret you don't know.</L>
<L>Yourselves you banter, but not it,</L>
<L>You shew your spleen, but not your wit.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Inspiring virtue by our rules,</L>
<L>And in ourselves secure,</L>
<L>We have compassion for those fools,</L>
<L>Who think our acts impure:</L>
<L>We know from ignorance proceeds</L>
<L>Such mean opinion of our deeds.</L>

<L>We Brothers of Freemasonry</L>
<L>Lay a just claim to these.</L>
