<HEAD>THE SACRED MINISTER: A NEW POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE <HI>some</HI> the <HI>Hero sing,</HI> with all his Skill,</L>
<L>His martial Valour and his famous Deeds,</L>
<L>And the dire Exploits of his Dogs of War:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While <HI>others</HI> celebrate <HI>the Patriot</HI> brave,</L>
<L>Who <HI>shakes his Hands from Bribes,</HI> and always scorns</L>
<L>To be or high or rich by filthy Ways;</L>
<L>And who, to selfish Views and sordid ends,</L>
<L>Ever prefers the public Interest:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While <HI>These</HI> ill-judging will applaud a Court,</L>
<L>Where Falshood, Lust and Vice appear in State;</L>
<L>And Virtue's Semblance is the But of Scorn:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While <HI>Those</HI> regardless are of Courts or Arms,</L>
<L>Of Valour's Force and most advent'rous Deeds:</L>
<L>For they can only think and write of <HI>Love,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="012864_0003_0F8B6E038779DD38"/>How it springs up, and how it operates</L>
<L>In Courts and Cities and calm rural Cots:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While <HI>Others</HI> call forth their poetic Fire,</L>
<L>And every Muse invoke, the Works to praise</L>
<L>Of wide Creation, Providence Divine,</L>
<L>And all the Wonders <HI>These</HI> present to View:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold! A feeble Genius would select</L>
<L>A Subject more adapted to his Thoughts:</L>
<L>He sings the MINISTER of Things Divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To shew, how he should be prepar'd and form'd;</L>
<L>What Piety and Learning should him fill,</L>
<L>And how <HI>These</HI> should be drawn to Exercise;</L>
<L>How he should live and how expend his Time;</L>
<L>How, or in House or Desk, he should discourse,</L>
<L>And how he worthily should quit the Stage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>This is the Work; The arduous Labour This:</HI></L>
<L>'Tis great beyond his Power, who undertakes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Therefore, <HI>O Wisdom and O Power Divine,</HI></L>
<L>JESUS, of all the Deity possest</L>
<L>In human Nature and in human Flesh;</L>
<L>Who, living here, didst <HI>teach, as Man ne'er taught,</HI></L>
<L>And didst in more than mortal Manner live;</L>
<L>And now art seated on GOD's glorious Throne;</L>
<L>My soul ascends to Thee with quiv'ring Wings:</L>
<L>Assist it's tow'ring Flight; enlarge it's Views,</L>
<L>And give it strength to reach it's noble End.</L>

<L>The Prophet, who of Royal Lineage came,</L>
<L>But, through the Grace Divine, more dignify'd,</L>
<L><HI>Esaias,</HI> when the Leprous King expir'd,</L>
<L>And worms were ending, as they had begun;</L>
<L>The living and immortal SAVIOUR saw</L>
<L>High on an elevated Throne above,</L>
<L>And with his Train the Heavenly Temple fill'd:</L>
<L><HI>The Deity,</HI> as <HI>burning ones</HI> with Wings</L>
<L>Cov'ring their Faces and their Feet from View:</L>
<L>And yet as flying with expanded Wings,</L>
<L>Gave forth responsive Voices: These the Words:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>JEHOVAH SABAOTH is wholly thrice:</HI></L>
<L><HI>His Glory is the Earth replenishing.</HI></L>
<L>Such were the Voices: So HE cried aloud:</L>
<L>Then of the Door the stately Columns mov'd;</L>
<L>And the whole House was fill'd with <HI>threatning Smoke;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Smoke threatning</HI> darksome Things to <HI>Israel</HI>'s House.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Prophet then astonied,—<HI>Wo to me!</HI></L>
<L>How can I live? For I'm <HI>of Lips unclean,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And I with People dwell of leprous Lips:</HI></L>
<L>And yet JEHOVAH SABAOTH I've seen:</L>
<L><HI>Mine eyes have view'd the King,</HI> th' enthroned King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to the Prophet came <HI>a Seraph</HI> forth</L>
<L>With a live Coal, dispatching, in his Hand,</L>
<L>Which HE, with Forceps, from the Altar took:</L>
<L>And This HE laid upon the Prophet's Mouth:</L>
<L><HI>Lo This,</HI> said HE, <HI>has gently touch'd thy Lips:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thy Sin's expiated: Thy Filth is cleans'd.</HI></L>

<L>Reviving Tidings to the deadned Man!</L>
<L>He's rais'd from death, and finds new Life and Strength:</L>
<L><HI>The Voice,</HI> the Word, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> then he hear'd:</L>
<L><HI>Whom shall I send,</HI> HE said; <HI>and who will go</HI></L>
<L><HI>For us,</HI> as we're <HI>IMMANUEL,</HI> GOD and Man?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Prophet, rapt and animated, cries,</L>
<L><HI>Here, LORD, I am: Me with thy Pleasure send.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fearful Message then JEHOVAH spake;</L>
<L>The same it was the GOD Incarnate brought,</L>
<L>When HE the faithless, wicked <HI>Hebrews</HI> told;</L>
<L>That, since themselves they made deaf, blind and hard,</L>
<L><HI>Deaf, blind and hard they</HI> therefore <HI>should remain:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor would HE turn, and heal, their hardned Hearts.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O blest JEHOVAH, Son of GOD confess'd,</L>
<L>Do not, or others or unworthy me,</L>
<L>On such a direful Errand send as this;</L>
<L>Which <HI>makes my Entrails tremble, Knees to smite,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Rottenness to penetrate my Bones.</HI></L>
<L>But send thy worthless servant, who, with Those,</L>
<L>That are more worthy, thy free Gifts have gain'd,</L>
<L>The dark t' enlighten, and the stubborn bend,</L>
<L>To purify the filthy, and to raise</L>
<L>From Earth and Flesh and Sense immortal Souls,</L>
<L>And bring them to the Life of GOD and Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who dares think such high Success to find,</L>
<L>That his Heart has, and Lips, and Hands unclean,</L>
<L>And still, conversing, lives among th' impure?</L>
<L>The GOD of Grace indeed his Gifts bestows</L>
<L>On them that are <HI>rebellious</HI> Sons of Men:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="012864_0006_0F8B6E08445DB4D0"/>
<L>As Kings, when crown'd, with lib'ral Hand dispense</L>
<L>Their Coronation Medals on the Croud.</L>

<L>The souls of many to perpetual Bliss;</L>
<L>While they, who have them, <HI>perish in their Sins;</HI></L>

<L>Before he ventures on his arduous Task,</L>
<L>Discretely should begin his work at Home.</L>

<L>He should not yet, like the vain <HI>Pharisee,</HI></L>

<L>THE Work's begun: The Earth's dug up; the Soil,</L>
<L>That's light and loose, is now remov'd away;</L>
<L>And firm and sure is the Foundation laid:</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Vital Goodness</HI> in the Teacher's Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But This alone; though noble, and it makes</L>
<L>The Man of real Worth, approv'd of GOD,</L>
<L>Useful to Men and meet for Heavenly Things;</L>
<L>'Twill not alone suffice the Man to make</L>
<L>Worthy the Name of <HI>Sacred Minister.</HI></L>
<L>He should <HI>much Knowledge</HI> have and <HI>Learning deep:</HI></L>
<L>For otherwise, by Laymen learn'd and Wise▪</L>
<L>He will be held in most profound Contempt:</L>
<L>Nor, for him, will his <HI>Piety</HI> obtain</L>
<L>To <HI>sacred Minister</HI> the due Esteem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some there have been, though <HI>Novices</HI> in Truth,</L>
<L>Who suddenly, alas! too suddenly,</L>
<L>Into the Teacher's Chair themselves have thrust:</L>
<L>Neglecting of those Ways the prudent use</L>
<L>Knowledge to gain, They Preachers have commenc'd,</L>
<L>Not yet <HI>instructed Scribes:</HI> In firm, unfledg'd,</L>
<L>They have the Nest forsook, and flutter'd off:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="012864_0009_0F8B6E0DA9A35510"/>And yet, for them, have great Assemblies met:</L>
<L>The high, the low, the rich and poor have come</L>
<L>To hear the chirping of the harmless Doves:</L>
<L>And, as they hear, they're charm'd; and, with the View,</L>
<L>They are transported at their pretty Ways.</L>
<L>But the more wise and Skilful saw their Wants,</L>
<L>Their doleful Wants, and inward Feebleness:</L>
<L>And, shrugging up their Shoulders, sighing said,</L>
<L><HI>How much, in Things and Persons, is there Vain!</HI></L>
<L>For these same forward Creatures little know;</L>
<L>And, as <HI>unlearn'd, the Scriptures torture will.</HI></L>
<L>If you their Declamations can but read,</L>
<L>Mistakes, <HI>as Alps on Alps,</HI> will rise to view:</L>
<L>And you'll, amazed, stand as quite aghast,</L>
<L>That voice and Flutter should for sense be took.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From such Examples all, who <HI>live, may learn,</HI></L>
<L>That, as a Wise Guide, to secure Regard,</L>
<L>A Man, both Days and Nights, should poring be,</L>
<L>And all right Knowledge after he should search,</L>
<L>In order to improve and mend Mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great <HI>Skill in Languages</HI> should be obtain'd:</L>
<L>For sure, by <HI>This,</HI> right Meaning must be learn'd:</L>
<L>If You or I nor <HI>Greek</HI> nor <HI>Hebrew</HI> know,</L>
<L>We can't a Verse of holy Writ explain:</L>
<L>We may indeed, from <HI>others,</HI> take their Sense:</L>
<L>But are we sure it is <HI>the Sense Divine?</HI></L>
<L>Therefore, the <HI>Grammar of the Text,</HI> let's learn,</L>
<L>That we the <HI>true Theology</HI> may find,</L>
<L>And may it fairly unto others shew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="012864_0010_0F8B6E0FC6B23FA8"/>
<L>This is right Conduct: While too many slight</L>
<L>Such Care and Toil, and quite contented are,</L>
<L>That any, Sense, should gather for their Use.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Eudoxus</HI> was more conscientious far:</L>
<L>He studied well those Tongues, wherein GOD's Word</L>
<L>Was by his Spirit giv'n for human Good:</L>
<L>And then, his Knowledge, wisely he improv'd</L>
<L><HI>The terms</HI> in every text to understand</L>
<L>From the vast Labours of the plodding few:</L>
<L>And, having found the meaning of those Terms,</L>
<L>He then, from grateful Knowledge, gave the Sense;</L>
<L>And Inspiration issued from his lips.</L>
<L>But O! how griev'd was he, when Men of Worth</L>
<L>From others took, as Sense of Books Divine,</L>
<L>What ne'er was there, nor thence could be deriv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sacred <HI>Forms of Speech,</HI> and of the <HI>Tongues</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Idioms,</HI> should be very justly known:</L>
<L>The <HI>Customs</HI> too of Nations should be learn'd,</L>
<L>Not only holy ones, but those profane.</L>
<L><HI>The Persons,</HI> and the <HI>Places, of like Name</HI></L>
<L>Should be distinguish'd, lest the teachers err,</L>
<L>And, into Errors, all their Hearers lead.</L>
<L>So should <HI>the Works remarkable</HI> be found,</L>
<L>To which the sacred Pages yet refer.</L>
<L>The ancient <HI>Isthmian and Olympic</HI> Games,</L>
<L>Well to relate, they should be learned well.</L>
<L>And all those Ways, which various Nations us'd,</L>
<L>In Scripture glanc'd at, they should well discern.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="012864_0011_0F8B6E115A08B410"/>
<L>The Men unlearned can't these Things explain:</L>
<L>For they are far beyond their narrow Ken:</L>
<L>If therefore they presume t' interpret them,</L>
<L>Mistakes and Blunders they will frequent make:</L>
<L>The heark'ning People cannot these perceive:</L>
<L>But the learn'd will, and pensive hang their Heads,</L>
<L>The Hearers pitying and Instructors both.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Regarding well these things, the Minister</L>
<L>With Care will for his People well provide:</L>
<L>From Morn to Night he for his Charge has Thought,</L>
<L>And for them often has his sleepless Nights,</L>
<L>That they may truly wise and happy be.</L>
<L>Each Week for them with Studies close begins:</L>
<L>Nor has he Rest or Ease, till he obtains</L>
<L>Such Food as may afford them Health and Joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so <HI>Incurio:</HI> He, amidst the Gifts</L>
<L>Of bounteous Providence, with Calmness lives▪</L>
<L>He happy, with a Face of Ease, appears;</L>
<L>And so he lumbers on throughout the Week:</L>
<L>Frequent he comes, where plenteous Tables are,</L>
<L>And various Foods and gen'rous Wines are serv'd:</L>
<L>At Night he plump returns, and peaceful sleeps.</L>
<L><HI>The Sheep in Desart left</HI> don't press his Mind;</L>
<L>Till the Week closes: Then his hurried Thoughts</L>
<L>Return to think of Viands for the Fold:</L>
<L>If, for his Place, no Vicar he can gain,</L>
<L>He, in his hasty Way, will something get;</L>
<L>And, on the next day, come with easy Air</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="012864_0012_0F8B6E1323012E80"/>And face unmeaning to bring Crudities:</L>
<L>When the faint Flock, if not dispos'd to rest,</L>
<L>Look for their Food, and longing look: But ah!</L>
<L>They chiefly have but Words; and Words are Wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such were the <HI>Jewish Scribes;</HI> When JESUS said,</L>
<L><HI>Great is the Harvest; few, the Workers are:</HI></L>
<L><HI>To the great Lord of th' Harvest therefore pray,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That, for his Harvest, He would Lab'rers send.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Geron</HI> was such a Labourer betimes.</L>
<L>To CHRIST, and to his People for his Sake,</L>
<L>Sacred his Time and Strength and Studies were.</L>
<L>When he, for them, Divine Discourses made,</L>
<L>He still, as looking on, his Master ey'd;</L>
<L>And thought, to Him, that he must give Account:</L>
<L>He thought, he read, he wrote, as soon to die;</L>
<L>And, at his Death, t' appear before his Judge:</L>
<L>And, while preparing thus, he rear'd his Heart;</L>
<L><HI>Great GOD and SAVIOUR, Thy Direction give;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Assist my faltering Efforts for thy Sake;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with Success Divine bless weak Attempts:</HI></L>

<L>THE <HI>sacred Minister</HI> is now prepar'd,</L>
<L>And waits the Call of <HI>Nolan Instrument:</HI></L>
<L>It rings: It tolls: He gravely walks along,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="012864_0013_0F8B6E134B29D578"/>And, with Mind Heav'nwards, to his Desk repairs:</L>
<L>Reaching that Place, as well as going there,</L>
<L>He lifts his Soul, as flies the winged Dart:</L>
<L>To Heav'n it goes, solliciting its Aid,</L>
<L>And asking it <HI>Prosperity to send.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, with well furnish'd Mind and warmed Heart,</L>
<L>He pours out sentimental, cordial Prayers;</L>
<L>Such as no Reader of a Book can pour.</L>
<L>Infatuation yet will keep it's Ground.</L>
<L>A well known Liturgy, the Spawn of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Must yet be us'd: And yet the piteous Priests,</L>
<L>Who have no Praying Powers, or none dare move,</L>
<L>A formal Piety encourage will:</L>
<L>Which, though Devotion's Name and Form it wear;</L>
<L>Tis not the Thing: For those confin'd to Forms</L>
<L>Must to low Words of others sink their Minds,</L>
<L>And, with sunk Minds, old Terms must mumble o'er.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not such <HI>Coelestius:</HI> He no Crutches needs.</L>
<L>Pinion'd with Faith and Love he soars aloft,</L>
<L>And heav'nwards bears his Flock on Eagle's Wings:</L>
<L>They gladly mount, and think it good to rise;</L>
<L>Nor willing are to sink to Things below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Minister, when he has sung</L>
<L>With tuned Heart and Voice his LORD's high Praise,</L>
<L>Rises the Messages of Heav'n to speak.</L>
<L><HI>These</HI> from the Oracles Divine he took:</L>
<L>Nor does ever a Discourse produce,</L>
<L>Wherein he does not fairly shew, how Men</L>
<L>May come to GOD by CHRIST, and blessed prove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="012864_0014_0F8B6E13FB9042B0"/>
<L>The Manner of his speaking is most plain;</L>
<L>And yet adapted to the Truths he brings.</L>
<L>When he Religion's Doctrines, and its Laws,</L>
<L>Explains and urges, placid is his Face:</L>
<L>And his whole Air shews sorth his Mind serene.</L>
<L>If he the Promises of Grace unfolds,</L>
<L>He's all alive, by quickning Motives rais'd:</L>
<L>And, when the Terrors of Almighty Wrath</L>
<L>He would display, he speaks with potent Voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quite seemly too his Actings all appear:</L>
<L>Not like to those, which <HI>Raphael</HI> drew for <HI>Paul,</HI></L>
<L>That He might shew, with high uplifted Hands,</L>
<L>His high Dislike of Vile Idolatry,</L>
<L>Which in vain <HI>Athens</HI> mightily prevail'd:</L>
<L>Much less will he in Christian Temples use</L>
<L>The trifling Gestures of <HI>the Theatre.</HI></L>
<L>As, in discoursing, greatly he will scorn</L>
<L><HI>Of human Wisdom the enticing Words;</HI></L>
<L>So, in his Method of Delivery,</L>
<L>He will no <HI>Garrick</HI> for a Pattern take.</L>
<L>But, as his Subjects variously demand,</L>
<L>He will or calm or vehement appear</L>
<L>In Word and Action, as may well become</L>
<L><HI>The Words of JESUS and eternal Life.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So speaks he, as to Men, form'd from above,</L>
<L>Redeem'd by JESUS, Candidates for Bliss,</L>
<L>And yet in Danger of perpetual Woes,</L>
<L>These, by persuasive Motives, taught by CHRIST,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="012864_0015_0F8B6E14E1A63A30"/>He wooes to Wisdom, Virtue, Happiness.</L>
<L>And since mere Suasions will not gain these Ends,</L>
<L>He lifts his Prayer, that Energy Divine</L>
<L>May, to his Toil, a prosperous Issue give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Labour done; he then quite spent returns</L>
<L>To bless his Household: And, though yet fatigu'd,</L>
<L>He's still for Labour: For he loves his Work;</L>
<L>Nor thinks, that all is done, while Part remains:</L>
<L>This Part at Home, or, he, abroad, performs:</L>
<L>For, by his Lips and Walk, he preaches still,</L>
<L>And thus <HI>the Word of Life holds forth</HI> to all.</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>PART IV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>THE Minister,</HI> as <HI>Preaching,</HI> has been seen:</L>
<L>Now let us view his <HI>Conduct and his Ways.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As he himself, with all his mental Powers</L>
<L>And his whole Body to his GOD has giv'n;</L>
<L>He hence employs himself and all for GOD,</L>
<L>As bought for HIM, and for HIM set apart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He therefore won't spend Time, as many do.</L>
<L>To earthly Men and Things he'll be no Dupe.</L>
<L>True he must eat and drink and slumbers take;</L>
<L>And he submits to These, as Nature claims:</L>
<L>For he well knows, that, by Recruits from These,</L>
<L>He, to serve GOD and Men, is fitted well.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="012864_0016_0F8B6E15B133C788"/>
<L>Friends he would have: But he's afraid of <HI>These,</HI></L>
<L>Lest they should steal away his precious Time:</L>
<L>Therefore not long with them will he abide.</L>
<L>And, if to him they friendly Visits make,</L>
<L>Them he'll not urge to make their Visits long;</L>
<L>For he wants Aids, not Hindrances, of Works.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If men of Wealth and Influence him invite</L>
<L>To their full Houses, he will sometimes go;</L>
<L>But then to answer kind and pious Ends:</L>
<L>Yet often he will not their Calls accept;</L>
<L>When, modest, he can fair Excuses make.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, when or Friends beguile or great ones force;</L>
<L>So that, of lost Time, he may well complain:</L>
<L>Then sorrowing he retires; to Work he goes,</L>
<L>And, by fresh Diligence, repairs his Loss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Himself he'll not entangle with the World:</L>
<L>Quite happy he, if he a <HI>Partner</HI> has</L>
<L>That will take, from him, Earth's Incumbrances,</L>
<L>And make him free to mind his great Employ:</L>
<L>But if, not yet, he has his <HI>faithful Mate;</HI></L>
<L>Some <HI>Friend</HI> he'll find t' abate his worldly Cares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If Sicknesses off from his Studies take,</L>
<L>And pains afflictive Molestation bring,</L>
<L>From These, he will the best of Lessons learn:</L>
<L>And, when, by good Advice and prudent Care,</L>
<L>From <HI>These</HI> he's freed; he with new Vigour ther.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="012864_0017_0F8B6E166B0AA958"/>Goes to his Labours, and makes such Dispatch,</L>
<L>That he redeems the Hours he grieving spent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Sicknesses do, on his People, seize,</L>
<L>And any Sorrows lie upon their Hearts;</L>
<L>The Minister will then sweet Kindness shew,</L>
<L>And, by his Visits, bear away their Pains:</L>
<L>But to those, chiefly, quite <HI>of weary Minds;</HI></L>
<L>As Sinners great, who know their mighty Guilt,</L>
<L>And hence their GOD dread as their Enemy;</L>
<L>He will <HI>the Tongue, that's learned,</HI> lenient bring</L>
<L>To dissipate their Fears and sooth their Minds</L>
<L>He'll say; <HI>Not willing is the GOD of Grace,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That any perish, but that all repent:</HI></L>
<L>And He <HI>so lov'd the world, He gave his Son,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That who on Him believes with cordial Faith</HI></L>
<L><HI>Perish should not, but have eternal Life:</HI></L>
<L>And, <HI>of this Life, our Jesus has the Words;</HI></L>
<L>Who freely <HI>all to come to Him</HI> invites,</L>
<L>To teach and rule and save them perfectly:</L>
<L><HI>Nor will he any, who</HI> so <HI>come, reject:</HI></L>
<L>Then come to Him, and <HI>of his fulness</HI> take:</L>
<L>And, in his Favour, <HI>let your Soul delight.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this, and more, the learn'd one softly speaks:</L>
<L>Whence the dejected Patient, with rais'd Head</L>
<L>And Brow relax'd and anxious Breast remov'd,</L>
<L>Blesses the Man, that calm'd his ruffled Soul,</L>
<L>And blesses GOD his Saviour for the Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Minister is rarely seen abroad;</L>
<L>But, when he goes, treats all with Courtesy:</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="012864_0018_0F8B6E170F348078"/>Whether, in House or Streets, he any sees,</L>
<L>To all he <HI>good</HI> and sweet <HI>Behaviour</HI> shews.</L>
<L>As he Relations various sustains,</L>
<L>In all <HI>These</HI> well, he's careful, to conduct.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>All, whom CHRIST JESUS will</HI> to Heav'n <HI>receive</HI></L>
<L><HI>He will receive</HI> and own his Brethren dear:</L>
<L><HI>All, who CHRIST</HI>'s <HI>Image have, be will approve,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor any, who this Image have, condemn.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Young and old he mild Instruction gives,</L>
<L>And Counsels sweeter than <HI>Hyblean Combs:</HI></L>
<L>And, if, in Speech and Action, some are ill,</L>
<L>These in parental Way grave he'll rebuke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>As he would</HI> glad <HI>receive, to all he does:</HI></L>
<L>Nor would in Heart or Speech or Conduct wrong</L>
<L>The lowest Man, or his word Enemy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And, while he <HI>Justice does</HI> and <HI>Mercy shews:</HI></L>
<L><HI>As with his GOD agreed, he humbly walks:</HI></L>
<L>The SAVIOUR still he eyes as <HI>Jesus LORD.</HI></L>
<L>So doing all, that's right, as <HI>unto Him;</HI></L>
<L>And still, in doing well, his <HI>Pattern</HI> minds.</L>
<L>And, while <HI>he craves,</HI> he still <HI>depends</HI> on CHRIST.</L>
<L>For <HI>Grace to live,</HI> as he has taught and liv'd.</L>
<L><HI>What's crooked</HI> in him is <HI>not</HI> yet quite <HI>strait:</HI></L>
<L><HI>And, what is wanting, he can't number yet:</HI></L>
<L>And hence he still on the Redeemer trusts</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="012864_0019_0F8B6E17E1A269A0"/>For Pardon and Acceptance with his GOD,</L>
<L>And a sure Title to immortal Bliss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is the sacred Minister in truth!</L>
<L>The living Teacher of the Christian Life:</L>
<L>Not like <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>-Player,</HI> mimicking a Prince:</L>
<L>But, as <HI>a Child, resembling Heav'n's high King.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should Men him praise, This but excites his Fear,</L>
<L>Lest GOD lose Glory; and <HI>he</HI> gain soul Pride,</L>
<L>And into <HI>Satan's Condemnation sink.</HI></L>
<L>But, if Men basely him defame, traduce,</L>
<L>And of him <HI>falsely</HI> wicked Things relate;</L>
<L>Careful he'll shun those Things of <HI>ill Report,</HI></L>
<L>And, of those ill Things, will <HI>th' Appearance shun:</HI></L>
<L>For the false Men he'll <HI>pray;</HI> and them he'll <HI>bless;</HI></L>
<L>And, when he can, will chearful <HI>do them good.</HI></L>

<L>ADvanc'd in Life and Wisdom; Grown in Grace;</L>
<L>Improv'd in Knowledge of GOD's glorious Son,</L>
<L>And in his Likeness: So <HI>complete in Him;</HI></L>
<L>And ripen'd now for Happiness complete:</L>
<L>Behold! <HI>The Minister should finish well.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo! Now he <HI>daily dies,</HI> expecting Death,</L>
<L>And, for it's coming, daily he prepares.</L>
<L>Those Things, that, in his last Hours, may give Pain,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="012864_0020_0F8B6E18842B0C10"/>He, as the Gates of Hell, with Care avoids:</L>
<L>And he, with Care, will all those Things perform,</L>
<L>Which, well perform'd, he will, when dying, wish.</L>
<L>He every Office does of Righteousness,</L>
<L>Of Love and Goodness; and in Season too,</L>
<L>Lest he the fair Occasion should let slip.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He'll <HI>Watch and Pray,</HI> that, aided from above,</L>
<L>At last <HI>his Faith and Patience may not fail.</HI></L>
<L>He will sit <HI>Counsels, and Instructions</HI> give,</L>
<L>Public and private, as a dying Man:</L>
<L>And, faithful, he will <HI>Charges</HI> fit dispense</L>
<L>To all, with whom connected, as they come;</L>
<L>And These, as <HI>ready to depart,</HI> pronounce</L>
<L>With tender Love and grave Authority.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tokens he'll grant to Friends of Love sincere:</L>
<L>And, while the <HI>Prayers</HI> of all he humble <HI>asks;</HI></L>
<L>He will Heav'ns <HI>Blessings wish</HI> to all around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As he would, <HI>living, live unto his LORD;</HI></L>
<L>So, <HI>to his LORD, when dying, he would die:</HI></L>
<L>Thus <HI>dying he, as living, is his LORD</HI>'s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Greatly he dies, commending Glory's King;</L>
<L>His Truths applauding and his holy Ways</L>
<L>To all about him: Urging all of these</L>
<L><HI>To fellow him,</HI> as he has meant and try'd</L>

<L>Beyond the human or Angelic Hosts:</L>

<L>And now what yet remains to do? To die!</L>
<L>No! This is done: <HI>Death's Bitterness is past.</HI></L>
