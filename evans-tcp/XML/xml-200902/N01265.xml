<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Design of the ESSAY we are upon, is, <HI>To Do Good in the world;</HI> and very Particularly, among <HI>Younger Persons of the Female Sex;</HI> whose Improvement in Piety, would not be <HI>too much</HI> Studied, if there were <HI>much more</HI> Study Employ'd than there is upon it.</P>
<P>I am able to say, on the behalf of this <HI>Essay,</HI> That I have a small Army of Neighbours Importunately calling upon me for it; A good number who tell me, tis pity such <HI>Piety</HI> shou'd have <HI>two Burials;</HI> one in the <HI>Grave;</HI> 'tother in <HI>Oblivion:</HI> And it is a very allowable thing to gratify their <HI>Importunity.</HI> But this is a sort of a <HI>Thread-bare Apology,</HI> which I have no va∣lue for; I have cast it off a great while ago. It signifies nothing, if the Things Published upon it, are not for <HI>the Service of Mankind.</HI> And if they are <HI>so,</HI> [as, Reader, I hope, what thou hast before thee, will be!] there needs neither <HI>That,</HI> nor any other Apology at all, for their Publication.</P>
<P>I have not Complemented the Memory of the Deceased Person; or treated her, as a <HI>Ba∣sil</HI> his <HI>Julitta,</HI> a <HI>Nyssen</HI> his <HI>Pulcheria,</HI> a <HI>Chrysostom</HI> his <HI>Pelagia,</HI> and a <HI>Jerom</HI> his <HI>Marcella.</HI> Nor have I been labouring to make an Addition unto <HI>Beverovicius</HI>'s Catalogue, of, <HI>Women that
<PB REF="001508_0003_0FB380365E266A10"/>
have been Considerable.</HI> I have only <HI>Shown</HI> some of the <HI>Garments of Righteousness;</HI> I will not so much say, <HI>Made</HI> by a Younger <HI>Dorcas;</HI> (only that the <HI>Needle-work</HI> of her <HI>Pen</HI> was Employ'd thereupon:) but <HI>Worn</HI> by her, and <HI>Made,</HI> I should rather say, by the <HI>Good Spirit of Grace,</HI> whose internal <HI>Raiment of Needle-work,</HI> renders the <HI>Daughters</HI> of the LORD, <HI>all Glorious within.</HI> The Account, I hope, is <HI>Modest;</HI> and without <HI>Flourish;</HI> And every thing in the world for∣born, but what was thought might be <HI>Ʋseful.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lamp</HI> found in <HI>Tulliola</HI>'s Tomb, was not of so much use, as that <HI>Shining Piety,</HI> which is in such Papers, as we find in a little Trunk of a Young <HI>Agatha</HI> departed from us. We are with a mighty Advantage told, <HI>what should be done,</HI> when we are at the same time shown, <HI>what has been done,</HI> in a course of Piety.</P>
<P>The Sorrow on the Death of such a Chri∣stian, is marvellously Extinguished, by such <HI>Reliques!</HI> O <HI>Rome,</HI> How preferrible to thy boasted <HI>Reliques!</HI> I had almost said, Every <HI>Sorrowful Tear</HI> is a sort of a <HI>Sadducee.</HI></P>
<P>And the satisfaction of having <HI>Done Good,</HI> by Exhibiting the <HI>Memorials of Piety</HI> left by such a <HI>Christian,</HI> will be an abundant com∣pensation, for all the Obloquy, of some En∣vious People, who are of another, and a well known Character.</P>
<P>It was a peculiar Honour to <HI>Shallum,</HI> Neh. III. 12. That <HI>he and his Daughters,</HI> did more than a little to build up the <HI>City of God.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>MEMOIRS</HI> OF <HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerusha Oliver, Who Died, 30. <HI>d.</HI> 10. <HI>m.</HI> 1710.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. ABOUT the middle of the former Century, there died at <HI>Norwich</HI> in Great <HI>Britain,</HI> one of the Female Sex, &amp; of no very considerable Quality, in the Thirtieth Year of her Age; who left behind her a <HI>Confession</HI> of her <HI>Faith,</HI> and a <HI>Relation</HI> of her <HI>Experience,</HI> with some other grateful &amp; useful Remembrances of her Piety. The famous Dr. <HI>John Collings,</HI> thought it worth his while, to Publish those <HI>Memorials,</HI> with a Sermon of his own, which he Entitles; <HI>The Life and Death of a true Christian; deciphered
<PB N="2" REF="001508_0005_0FB3803DD2A59328"/>
in a Sermon, at the Burial of</HI> Mary Simp∣son, <HI>a Religious Young Maid, lately Living in the City of Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>There has lately Died in <HI>Boston,</HI> one of the Female Sex, as considerably Cir∣cumstanced; who had not attained unto that Age by several Years; but who has left behind her, as Memorable Testi∣monies of her Piety, which may prove as Grateful and Useful to many Sur∣vivers; and I am desired by many, to make a brief <HI>Collection</HI> of them. Tho' the <HI>Collector</HI> should be supposed never so nearly Related unto the Person De∣ceased, yet while he forbears every thing that looks like Flourish and Applause upon her Character, and gives but a bare Transcript, and Extract of those <HI>Memoirs,</HI> which her own Pen had pro∣vided, it is to be hoped, that many, especially Young Persons, and of the Female Sex, may Enjoy the Benefit of these things, without any Invidious Re∣proaches upon the offer of them. <HI>Na∣zianzen</HI> began his Funeral Oration upon his Deceased Sister <HI>Gorgonia,</HI> with a short Answer to all Cavil against so <HI>Domestick

a Performance; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, They being things that I am so nearly Re∣lated unto, they are not the less True, but the more known, for That; and it is but the more Just for me to give an Account concerning them.</HI> What was Good Rea∣son Twelve Hundred Years ago, should still be so!</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. THE Young Gentlewoman, who is now (as I have told you,) to <HI>Write,</HI> rather than to be <HI>Written</HI> of, was Born at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>N. E. April</HI> 16. 1684. a Daughter of Dr. IN∣CREASE MATHER; And in so say∣ing, I have sufficiently intimated, what Education was bestow'd upon her. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Richard Mather</HI> of <HI>Dor∣chester,</HI> and (by the Mothers side) Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> the for ever Famous Teacher of the Church first in <HI>Boston,</HI> were her Grand-fathers. She wanted not for good Sense; and as she was betimes a <HI>Good Reader,</HI> so by being a <HI>Great Reader</HI> ever since, Four Years Old, in <HI>Historical</HI> Books, as well as <HI>Theological,</HI> she furnished her mind with a stock of many Valu∣able
<PB N="4" REF="001508_0007_0FB38045CEAB7288"/>
Treasures. But the <HI>Early Fear of God,</HI> was the most Valuable of all the things that Enriched her; and not the least Observable. <HI>Secret Prayer</HI> was an Exercise of her <HI>Infancy;</HI> The <HI>Fear of Sin,</HI> had a strong Influence upon her; And especially she so fear'd a <HI>Lye,</HI> that she then began a Custom she never left off; to Avoid <HI>Positive</HI> Expressions, but rather to say, <HI>I think,</HI> or, <HI>It may be,</HI> or, <HI>Tis likely;</HI> even in things that she was most assured of. So <HI>Dutiful</HI> she was to her <HI>Parents,</HI> that I have seen it asserted un∣der their Hand; <HI>She never gave occasion to them, to be once Angry with her, through∣out the whole Course of her Life!</HI> What she was in her <HI>Infancy,</HI> one might a little infer, from a <HI>Catalogue of her Sins,</HI> which her Penitent Soul drew up, as she was passing out of that Age, and yet scarce Entring into the Years which we call the <HI>Teens.</HI> Her <HI>Catalogue</HI> does consist of such strokes as these; <HI>What Sins have I been guilty of! O my Sins have been very many! — My Prayers have been sleighty: And I have spent my Time very unprofitably, And I have Read the Holy Word of God sleightily. And I have Heard the Word
<PB N="5" REF="001508_0008_0FB3804755ABA738"/>
of God sometimes, not with so much Dili∣gence as I should have done. And some∣times I have not attended upon Hearing of Prayer as I should have done. And I have been Proud. And I have been Unthankful. And sometimes I have not Obeyed my Fa∣ther and my Mother as I ought to have done. And I have Eaten things, which were hurt∣ful for me to Eat; And I have Eat more than I have had need to have done. And I have been afraid to go alone to Pray. I used to Pray, when I was a bed. Those were Lazy Prayers indeed! I have omitted those Duties of Meditation and Self-Exami∣nation. And I have sometimes omitted to ask a Blessing of God, when I have been go∣ing to Eat; and to give Thanks, when I had done Eating. And I have Performed this Duty sleightily. And I have been Guilty of one Sin, which is greater than all these; That is, Unbelief. And besides all this, there is that Sin of Sins, my Original Sin; My Nature is Sinful.</HI> Thus wrote <HI>Jerusha,</HI> while her <HI>Infancy</HI> was hardly yet Ex∣pired. These were the worst Things that she could Charge upon her self, when she was then making her Essays
<PB N="6" REF="001508_0009_0FB38048594ECE38"/>
towards the <HI>well-grown Devotions,</HI> of no less than <HI>Whole Days,</HI> of Retirement, for the <HI>Humiliations</HI> of a Repenting Soul. O more Aged Professors of Religion; To what a <HI>Tenderness</HI> in your <HI>walk with God,</HI> will you be Awakened; when you see a <HI>Child,</HI> Reflecting with all the Bitter∣ness of <HI>Repentance,</HI> on miscarriages which few, few among the Children of men, have any <HI>Trouble</HI> for, take any <HI>Notice</HI> of!</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. WHen she was Twelve Years old, the <HI>Resolutions of Piety</HI> in her were arrived unto such a Fixa∣tion and Establishment, that she came to a very Solemn Transaction with the Glorious GOD. She Entred into His COVENANT; and she did with all possible Solemnity set her Hand unto an Instrument for that purpose, which appears to have been very much her own Drawing up: tho' she had a well-known Copy of another before her. Here it is.</P>

Creature. I have Great Cause to Love and Serve so Gracious a God. What can I do less, than give up my self wholly to the Lord, to be for Him, and not for any other? And, O most Holy Lord God, wilt thou be pleased to Accept of me? Yea, Lord, I know, thou wilt accept of me, if I do Sin∣cerely Give my self to Thee in CHRIST. Then, O Lord, I Pray thee, for the Sake of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, Be at Peace with me. O Lord, I have fallen from thee, by my Sins, and I am by Nature, a Child of Hell. But thou, O Lord, of thy Infinite Mercy hast offered to be my God. There∣fore I come unto thee, and I Renounce my Sins; and, with thy Grace inabling me, I will Forsake them. I have been Serving thine Enemies, and Forgetting the God that has dealt very Mercifully with me. But now, O Lord, I will Endeavour to Serve thee; And I will not allow my self in any known Sin; and I will use the Means, which I know, thou hast appointed so the Destruction of my Corruptions. I here give my Heart unto thee; O Lord, I Pray thee to give me a New Heart. And I desire Grace from thee, that when thou shalt call me thereto, I may part with all that is dear unto me in the World, rather than turn from thee to the ways of Sin. O Lord, I have not any Hopes of being

Saved upon the account of any Righteous∣ness of my own. I acknowledge, that of my self, I am Helpless and Undone, and with∣out Righteousness. And whereas, thou dost offer to be my God thro' Christ, I do here take the Lord JEHOVAH, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for my Portion. And I do give my self Body and Soul, for thy Servant. I do here also Accept of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as the only way, by which Sinners may have Access to thee. And I do here joyn my self in a <HI>Marriage-Covenant</HI> with Him. O Lord, JESUS, I come unto thee, a most lothsome Creature. Who am I, that I should be <HI>Married</HI> unto the King of Glory! I Accept of thee for my Head &amp; Husband; and Embrace thee in all thy Offices. I chuse thee, the Lord my Righteousness. Grant that thy Wis∣dom may be my Guide; I desire, that thy Will may be my Will, and thy Word my Law. I put my Neck under thy Yoke, I Subscribe to thy Laws as Holy and Just and Good; and I do Promise to take them, at the Rule of my Life.</P>

<P>This Transaction was on a <HI>Twentieth Day of February,</HI> 1696. And in the re∣maining Years of her Life, constantly, as the <HI>Twentieth Day of February</HI> arrived.
<PB N="9" REF="001508_0012_0FB3804CD8950F70"/>
it was her Practice, to Review her COVENANT, and Bewayl her Sins a∣gainst it, and Fly to the <HI>Blood of the E∣verlasting Covenant</HI> for the Pardon of them, and Renew her Holy Resoluti∣ons to Live yet more Watchfully and Fruitfully, &amp; Implore the Assistences of Heaven to perform what she Resolved.</P>
<P>I will only Single out One or Two of those Commemorations, from her Memorials: February 20. 1703. <HI>It is this Day Seven years, since I did make a Co∣venant with God; in which Covenant, I did take the Lord Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for my Portion and Best Good; and did Promise to Forsake Sin, and to Endeavour to Serve God; And did Ac∣cept of Christ, for my Head &amp; Husband, and did Embrace Him in all His Offices. The Lord Pardon my not being so Sincere in, and so Faithful to, that Covenant, as I ought to have been, and make me Sincere in it, and Faithful to it; And Pardon all my Sins; keep me from Sin; and that for the Sake of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>At another time. Feb. 20. <HI>This Day Twelve years ago, I did very Explicitely
<PB N="10" REF="001508_0013_0FB38052D0AE5708"/>
enter into Covenant with God. The Lord Pardon my not being so Sincere in, and so Mindful of, and so Faithful to, that Cove∣nant, as I ought to have been, and make me Sincere, and Mindful, and Faithful; And make me very Thankful unto that God, who has not cut me down for my Unfruitfulness, but has spared me, not for Three Years only, but Four times Three Years, notwithstanding my Covenant-breaking. And the Lord spare me still, for the Sake of the Sacrifice of Christ, and grant that I may receive those continual Supplies of Grace and Strength from the Spi∣rit of Christ, that I want, and grant, that the Holy Spirit may Possess me, and fill me with Good Thoughts, and Good Desires, and Good Resolutions, and Good Actions; and grant that I may Glorify God as long as I Live; and grant that my Death may be Happy &amp; Joyful; and that for the Sake of my Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>That She might go on, with a more <HI>Confirmed Piety,</HI> when she was near Six∣teen years old, She joyned unto the Church, of which her Father and her Brother are the <HI>Pastors;</HI> and Exhibited unto the Church, an Acceptable <HI>Decla∣ration</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001508_0014_0FB380551255AE08"/>
of her Faith &amp; Repentance; and at the Table of the Lord, <HI>Seal'd</HI> the <HI>Co∣venant,</HI> in the way of His Appointment.</P>
<P>I think it my Duty to interpose my Advice unto the Young Readers, on this occasion. I fear, I fear, that the Action of <HI>Entring into Covenant with God,</HI> is too often done, with a little too much of the Strain of the <HI>Old Covenant.</HI> And for this very Cause, the Lord often leaves His <HI>Covenanting,</HI> and really Regenerate Children, to Some Remarkable <HI>Falls into Sin</HI> afterwards, that He may drive them into more <HI>Evangelical Terms,</HI> and make them sensible that it is not a <HI>Co∣venant of Works,</HI> but a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> wherein they are to draw near unto Him. I make no doubt, that the Pro∣posals of the Two Pious <HI>Alleines,</HI> and <HI>Janeway,</HI> and <HI>Guthry,</HI> and others, for, <HI>Explicit Covenanting with God,</HI> yea, <HI>Wri∣ting</HI> and <HI>Signing</HI> the Instrument, have been a mighty Service to Religion, in very many Thousands of Christians, as they were in our <HI>Jerusha.</HI> Yet <HI>I will shew you mine Opinion.</HI> The <HI>Form</HI> used by those Men of God, is hardly
<PB N="12" REF="001508_0015_0FB3805736A2A220"/>
quite <HI>Evangelical</HI> enough. I would propose, that the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> which is all over, <HI>Grace, Grace;</HI> be thoroughly considered by them who do this Action; and that the Terms of, <HI>I Confess,</HI> and, <HI>I Consent,</HI> and, <HI>I Desire,</HI> be preferred, unto, <HI>I Will;</HI> as Language best Suiting the Nature &amp; the Tenour of a <HI>Covenant,</HI> in which, tis not by <HI>Do∣ing,</HI> but by <HI>Receiving,</HI> that we arrive un∣to Blessedness, and that our Holy <HI>Reso∣lutions</HI> be form'd, as points of <HI>Thankful∣ness</HI> to the Lord from whom we <HI>Receive</HI> the Gift of <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and as parts of our Promised Blessedness; and the style thereof be, <HI>O my God, I ask of thee, that thou wilt give me the Grace to do such and such things!</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Febr.</HI> 20. 1709. She remembers that it was then Thirteen years since she had thus given her self to God, and has serious and holy Reflections on it: She did not Live to another <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P N="4">§ 4. SHe had a great Felicity in a more than ordinary strength and
<PB N="13" REF="001508_0016_0FB380590D5204D8"/>
sharpness in her <HI>Eye Sight,</HI> being able to Read by such a dim light as others could not, for which she was Thank∣ful to God, and made a good improv∣ment of it. She became from her Childhood a notable Mistress of her <HI>Pen;</HI> wrote a Fair Hand, and rarely Miss spelt a Word in all that Passed her Hand. She was to her Father his <HI>A∣manuensis,</HI> could read his ordinary hand and characters: Transcribed several of his Printed Books for the Press. A∣mong the many other Good Things, wherein she employ'd her <HI>Pen,</HI> One was her <HI>Diary,</HI> wherein she did, especially for the Last Ten Years of her Life, en∣ter such Passages as concern'd her <HI>In∣terior State;</HI> and indeed seldome let a Day pass without entring Something or other, that was an Aspiration of Se∣rious Piety: always Ending with that clause; <HI>For the Sake of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> All that I propose now to do, is only to make a few faithful <HI>Extracts</HI> from, and useful <HI>Remarks</HI> on, these Re∣served <HI>Memorials.</HI> And the first thing, which I will mention, before I Proceed
<PB N="14" REF="001508_0017_0FB3805C70C71368"/>
unto any thing else in the World shall be, a Notable Proof, That the Doctrines of <HI>Grace,</HI> have no Tendency to extin∣guish the <HI>Zeal of Good Works,</HI> and that <HI>Justification</HI> by a <HI>Precious Faith in the Righteousness of God</HI> our Saviour, is no Enemy to the most Conscientious and Elevated <HI>Purity.</HI> In her <HI>Diary,</HI> she very often makes her Flight unto the <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> of the Blessed JESUS, as the only <HI>Refuge</HI> of her Soul, the only Hope of her Acceptance with God. Very, very often her Language is this; <HI>The Lord Enable me, Sincerely to Renounce all my own Righteousness, and enable me Sincerely to Accept of the Righteousness of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and to depend on that alone, for my Justifica∣tion; And the Lord be Reconciled to me through</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and Pardon all my Sin, <HI>and keep me from Sin;</HI> and that for the Sake of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> This is the constant Strain! But now, Rea∣der, Didst thou not observe one clause in her Prayer; <HI>And keep me from Sin!</HI> This is what I am now to ob∣serve. Such a <HI>Dread and Hatred of Sin,</HI> there was in the Soul thus relying upon
<PB N="15" REF="001508_0018_0FB3805D52424930"/>
the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Sinless JESUS a∣lone, to <HI>Justify</HI> her, that it is a clause for ever occurring in almost every Prayer, Let the Subject she is upon be what it will: <HI>And keep me from Sin!</HI> I believe, the clause occurs many more than a Thousand times.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. EAch Book of her <HI>Diary,</HI> she usu∣ally began on her Birth-day. Then she noted her Age; Her <HI>Thanks</HI> to Heaven for <HI>Obtaining the Help</HI> which <HI>continued her to this Day;</HI> Her <HI>Griefs</HI> for the past Sins of a Life rolled away in so much <HI>Unfruitfulness;</HI> And her <HI>Pray∣ers,</HI> that the <HI>Next Year</HI> might be under the Blessing of God, and better spent, than any that had gone before it.</P>
<P>When she heard any <HI>Sermons</HI> Preach∣ed, (yea, or but the <HI>Repetition</HI> of them at a more <HI>Private Meeting</HI>) She would mention the Preacher, and the Subject; and there-upon add the <HI>Principal Wishes,</HI> which were enkindled in her Soul, by what she had been entertained withal. O our Hearers, If we were sure, that you were generally Such <HI>Attentive</HI> and
<PB N="16" REF="001508_0019_0FB3805ED12B0CD0"/>
Such <HI>Improving</HI> Hearers, how much would it Encourage our most Exquisite <HI>Preparations</HI> for the <HI>Offerings</HI> of the <HI>Sanctuary!</HI></P>
<P>If she were Detain'd from the Pub∣lick, she would in her <HI>Diary</HI> bewayl it, as a Chastisement upon her former Deficiences. And she would write down, her <HI>Wishes</HI> fetch'd out of the Books, that she Read at home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Comfortable Dispensations</HI> of Pro∣vidence towards her, She mention'd, with her <HI>Thankful Remarks</HI> upon them. Yea, tho' it were but in being Safely carried out and home, as far as <HI>Roxbury;</HI> She sees the Mercy of God in it.</P>
<P>If any <HI>Afflictive</HI> Thing befel her, She mention'd it, with her <HI>Useful Remarks</HI> upon it. Especially, if it were an Ill Turn upon her Health; tho' it were but a <HI>Cold,</HI> or a Fit of the <HI>Toothach;</HI> There's a Prayer on the occasion.</P>
<P>She Remarks the Dealings of God with <HI>Others;</HI> Especially if any thing either Good or Bad were observable in the condition of the <HI>Town;</HI> But most of all what occurr'd Joyful or Grievous,
<PB N="17" REF="001508_0020_0FB3806298F98630"/>
unto her nearest <HI>Relatives,</HI> and their <HI>Families;</HI> and she employes agreeable <HI>Meditations</HI> &amp; <HI>Supplications</HI> there-upon.</P>
<P>When she understood that her Bro∣ther in <HI>England</HI> had been Sick and was Recovered, she poured out her Soul in Praises to the Lord; and in Prayer for that Brother on that Occasion. It is not then to be wondred at, if she was deeply affected with the state of such of her near Relations as she had a con∣tinual Conversation with, and was at all times Acquainted with their Condi∣tion. It would make this Account too large, should all such particulars of that Nature be inserted. Nor would we trouble the World with private Con∣cerns. Only as a Monument of her Piety and Prayerfulness one Instance shall be taken notice of. She thus wri∣ting in her <HI>Diary, July,</HI> 10. 1708. <Q>This Day my Sister <HI>Sarah,</HI>
[She is Consort to Mr. <HI>Walter,</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Roxbury;</HI>] who had been Ill almost a Month; was in very Dangerous circumstances. A Messenger came to inform her Friends of it. I was
<PB N="18" REF="001508_0021_0FB38064EBEAC088"/>
much concerned for her, and much afraid that she would have Died. But the Gracious and Almighty GOD, who can do every thing; and who has granted great Deliverances to me, and to all my Brothers and Sisters, and who did some Years ago won∣drously, and even beyond Humane Expectation, deliver my Sister from Death, did again hear Prayers for her, and did grant her to be safe Delivered this Afternoon. The Lord Sanctify to my Sister, and to all Concerned, and to me in a special manner, the great Danger she was in, and the great and gracious Deliverance she has had this Day. The Lord perfect her Re∣covery, and grant that she and I too may Live while we are fit and willing to Dye.</Q></P>
<P>In her Diary, <HI>Aug.</HI> 10. 1710. which was Two Years after the former, speak∣ing of the same Sister; her words are, <Q>She has lately Experienced signal Mer∣cy. I was concerned for her, and in∣clined to Pray that she might have a better Lying-in than she useth to
<PB N="19" REF="001508_0022_0FB3806664C56420"/>
have. My Good God heard me; she has had a much better Travail than she uses to have. The Lord preserve her Life▪ restore her to Health, sancti∣fy all Divine Dispensations to her; make her Thankful, and make me Thankful for Mercies vouchsafed to her.</Q></P>
<P>Such as these were the breathings of her Pious Soul. It is surely a great Loss to them that survive, when such a Pray∣ing Relation is taken from them: Yet it is a Comfort that their Prayers Live after they themselves are gone out of this Sinful &amp; Sorrowful World.</P>
<P>She <HI>Oftentimes</HI> (and <HI>Constantly</HI> before the <HI>Communion,</HI>) set apart a Time, for Solemn <HI>Self-Examination.</HI> Many <HI>Books of Piety</HI> served her in this most ne∣cessary and Profitable Exercise. Parti∣cularly Mr. <HI>Doolittle</HI>'s; and of late years, Mr. <HI>Henries</HI> Discourse of the Lord's Supper: But she had none more at hand than one Entituled, <HI>A Companion for Com∣municants.</HI> The Result is entred still in her <HI>Diary,</HI> I don't find the Triumphs of Assurance; a frequent Result: but fre∣quently
<PB N="20" REF="001508_0023_0FB38100101514A8"/>
tis, a Modest and Humble <HI>Hope,</HI> That she has had a <HI>True Conversion,</HI> and that she <HI>is a True Believer</HI> on her Saviour.</P>
<P>In one of her Diaries her words are, <HI>This Day I spent some time in Self-Exami∣nation; The Lord grant that I might have the infallible Marks of a sincere Christian; and grant that I may discern those Marks</HI> In another her words are, <HI>I hope God has made me a true Believer on Christ. I have given my self to Him; and I desire to have Him for my Portion.</HI> Very often she writes, <HI>This Day I spent some time in Examining my self.</HI> And frequently Concludes upon it; <HI>I hope I am a Believer! I hope I am Converted!</HI></P>
<P N="6">§ 6. SHE was no stranger to that great Article of the <HI>Christian Asceticks,</HI> To Retire whole DAYES, for Com∣munion with God! To set apart <HI>Whole Dayes,</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting,</HI> (at least so much <HI>Fasting,</HI> as the Feeble state of her Health would allow;) in Secret, before the Lord. On which <HI>Dayes,</HI> it was her usage, to <HI>Pour out her Soul unto the Lord,</HI> in the most Extended
<PB N="21" REF="001508_0024_0FB3810191A7F178"/>
Supplications; Confess her own Er∣rors, and Implore the Favours of God for her self and others; And between those Devotions, intermix the <HI>Reading</HI> of such Things, as might blow up the Flame of Piety. The First Time that I find her Employed in the <HI>Fast of the Closet,</HI> is, when she was but Thirteen Years of Age. A marvellous way, for a <HI>Child</HI> to grow Grave, and Wise, and Holy; For a <HI>Child</HI> to be an <HI>Hundred Years Old.</HI> The last time save one, that I find any Distinct Record of her being thus Engaged, was upon the Proposal of her <HI>Marriage</HI> to a Vertuous Young Man, Mr. <HI>Peter Oliver,</HI> a Gold∣smith in <HI>Boston.</HI> One in Good Repu∣tation for a Skilful Artist in his Calling, as well as for his Piety. With whom she was like to have Lived Happily, he being very Tender of her. When her Marriage with that Person was like to proceed, she then writes, among other things; <HI>I would keep a Day of Prayer, to Desire the Direction and Blessing of God, and that every Circumstance of that Affair may be ordered in much Mercy. And that I may
<PB N="22" REF="001508_0025_0FB38103123B4450"/>
be provided with the supplies I now want. And I would Repent of all the sins of my Single state before I Marry. And I would seek unto God, for Grace and Wisdom, to or∣der my Temporal Affairs with Discretion; And to Glorify and Serve God, in all Rela∣tions and Conditions. The Lord hear me, and grant that my Soul may be Married unto</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and that both in Life &amp; Death, I may be the Lord's.</HI> The last Time of all was just before she Removed from her Fathers House, to House-keeping, and about three or four Months before her Death.</P>
<P>When Publick Dayes of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> and <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> arrived, her manner was to write down in her Diary, the things which 'twas her Desire, to be <HI>Hum∣bled</HI> for; and the Things to be <HI>Thank∣ful</HI> for. Here she considered not only her own <HI>Sins,</HI> and her own <HI>Sorrows,</HI> but those also of the Family whereto she was Related; and those of the <HI>Church</HI> whereof she was a Member; and those of the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Land.</HI> Yea, her Con∣siderations reached as far as the Cir∣cumstances of our whole Nation, and
<PB N="23" REF="001508_0026_0FB381048FDECE20"/>
the Afflictions of the People of God a∣broad in the World. It is very surpri∣zing to see what will be done this way, by a <HI>Child,</HI> that has an Heart possessed by the Holy Spirit of God! And, when the <HI>Mercies</HI> of God were to be acknow∣ledged, she not only took Notice of the <HI>Blessings</HI> that she had her self re∣ceived, but also of the Instances where∣in the Lord had Bless'd her several Re∣latives; (especially, in the <HI>Services</HI> which He honoured her Father, and her Two Brothers to do for Him:) and the Things wherein the Town &amp; Land, and Great <HI>Britain</HI> also were favoured of the Lord. Her Pious <HI>Methods</HI> are enough <HI>Explained,</HI> without our Tran∣scribing at large many Paragraphs of her <HI>Memorials;</HI> only one or two of them.</P>
<P><Q><HI>November</HI> 23. 1709. To-morrow a Publick Thanksgiving is to be attended in this Province. The Lord Pardon my not desiring a Thankful Heart so much as I ought, &amp; give me a Thank∣ful Heart; and grant that I may on the morrow attend both on Publick and Private Duties as I ought. Make me
<PB N="24" REF="001508_0027_0FB381079064F1F8"/>
Thankful for Publick Mercies; Mer∣cies vouchsafed to the People of God every where. Mercies to the <HI>English</HI> Nation. Mercies to this Land; To this Town; To this Family, To my Relations, and to me. There has been no Breach made in the Family by Death a great while. The Health of the Family has been preserved in a Gracious measure. My Parents are yet Living, and enjoy Health. My Father is favoured with a very Happy Old Age. My Brothers are both Em∣ploy'd in the work of the Ministry; and I hope have obtained Grace to be Faithful therein. My Sisters have I hope all of them Grace in their Hearts, and they have all of them had great Temporal Blessings bestowed on them at one time or other. My Sister <HI>Greens</HI> Husband has in the Year past, Experienc'd an Eminent Sea-delive∣rance. The Lord make me Thank∣ful for all these Mercies. As to my self, I am Alive. I have had many Deliverances from Death. I have had many Restorations from Sickness,
<PB N="25" REF="001508_0028_0FB3810910663248"/>
and one a few Months ago. I have had Friends about me; and suitable Medicines when I have been Sick. I enjoy things not only for Necessity, but for Conveniency. I have been preserved from Painful Diseases, which some better than I have been afflicted with. I have been kept both at Home and Abroad, from many Evils which would have befallen me, if my God had not preserved me. My Fears have been many times prevented. I enjoy a far greater measure of Health and Strength now, than I did a while ago. I ought to be Thankful for my Memory, and Understanding, and Speech; and for my Eye-sight, which I have in greater measure than many others. I ought to be Thankful for Temporal, much more for Spiritual Blessings. I was Born of Pious Pa∣rents; and my Grand-Parents all of them were Pious. I have had a Pious Education. I enjoy the Holy Scrip∣tures; and live under a Lively Mi∣nistry. I have many Good Books. I enjoy Sabbaths &amp; Sacraments. And
<PB N="26" REF="001508_0029_0FB38110E02412B8"/>
I hope God has given me Grace in my Soul. I think I Love CHRIST; I am sure I desire to Love Him, and to Live to Him. I have had sensible Answers of Prayer; and one this Week. The Lord grant that the Mer∣cies of God to me, may cause me to Devote my Body, my Soul, my All to my God; and grant that I may Praise, and Love, and Glorify Him as long as I Live; and grant that my Death may be Happy and Joyful; and <HI>keep me from Sin,</HI> and assure me that my Sins are Forgiven; and grant that I may Rejoyce in the Lord, and Joy in the God or my Salvation, and that for the sake of my Lord Jesus Christ.</Q></P>
<P>These were her Meditations by way of Preparation for a Day of Publick Thanksgiving. We shall only further insert what is found among the <HI>Memo∣rials</HI> of her walking with God, relating to a Day of Secret Prayer, between God and her own Soul. An Exercise of Piety, in which she was (as has been said) very frequent. The last of them was <HI>September</HI> 16. 1710. <Q>This being
<PB N="27" REF="001508_0030_0FB3811210F49B50"/>
(saith her <HI>Diary</HI>) the Day that I use to spend some time of it in Self-Examination; and in probability tis (if not the last) one of the last such Dayes that I shall have before I re∣move to House keeping, where it may be I shan't have that Leisure Time, nor that Opportunity of a Convenient Private Place, that now I have. I would feign spend as much of this Day as my Bodily Infirmities will per∣mit, in Self-Examination, (though my Health won't suffer me to Fast) Hu∣miliation, Repentance and Prayer. I have Experienc'd Gracious Answers of Prayer. When I was about to Marry, I set a Day apart in a special manner to seek unto my God, for a Blessing on that Affair. My God did Graciously Answer my Prayers then. Now I am to remove from this Habi∣tation, I would seek unto God that He would order every Circumstance of that Affair in much mercy; that He would Pardon the Sins I have been Guilty of here; and that He will give me Grace to Glorify Him in all Places,
<PB N="28" REF="001508_0031_0FB38113906BEF08"/>
and in all Relations, and that He will give all that wisdom I shall want to guide all my affairs with discretion, and that He will also, if it be His ho∣ly Will, preserve my Life and Health. I am (I think) above five Months gone with Child, which has occasioned my being much indisposed at times. I would in a very special manner this day prepare for my Lying-in, and would therefore prepare for Death. I am of a very fearful disposition na∣turally, and am much afraid of Death, and therefore afraid what will be the issue of my being with Child; but I desire to commit my whole self, Soul and Body, and all the concerns there∣of unto my God, and my Lord Jesus Christ; and particularly that affair of my Travail and Lying-in. My God has prevented my fears sometimes. I desire to trust in him that He will do so concerning this also. The Lord grant that I may be assured that my Sins are pardoned, and grant that I may through Christ obtain the victory over Death, &amp; over my fears of Death.
<PB N="29" REF="001508_0032_0FB38115D0C66348"/>
And let the blessing of God be on me while I am with Child. If it be His holy Will preserve me from hurtful falls and blows and frights, and from every evil accident, and grant that I may go out my Time, and when my Travail comes, Let it be easy, safe, and short if it be the Will of God, even far better than my fears, and that for the Sake of my Redeemer, who was born of a Woman. And let the bles∣sing of God be on the fruit of my Womb. Let it be a perfect Child, and let it be the Lord's. I would devote my self and my unseen Offspring unto God. And I do through the Grace of Christ resolve, and in His Strength promise, that if God will spare my Life, and the Life of my Offspring, I will endeavour to bring it up in the fear of God, and will endeavour that it may betimes Serve God, and Believe in Christ. The Lord accept of me and mine thro' Christ and give me a renewed and resigned will, and fit me for whatever may be the Will of God concerning me, <HI>and keep me from Sin,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="001508_0033_0FB381168FF8F958"/>
and hear my Prayers, and grant that I may pour out my Soul before God this day, &amp; having done so, grant that I may be no more sad; and this for the Sake of my Lord Jesus Christ.</Q></P>
<P>After this manner: Thus Self-Exa∣mining: Thus Humbling her Soul, thus Praying, thus Repenting, thus Trusting in God through Jesus Christ, did she leave her Fathers house, and by reason of bodily Infirmities came no more into it, after she was removed into a Fami∣ly of her own, but is now in her Hea∣venly Father's House: being in that Temple, she shall go no more out.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. ONE main Intention of her <HI>Diary,</HI> seems to have been, that she might note the principal De∣sires, which her Soul was on each Day, under the power of; which in the <HI>Sup∣plications of the Closet</HI> she principally in∣sisted on. <HI>Austin</HI> would say, The Life of Christianity, was chiefly made up of <HI>Holy Desires.</HI> The <HI>Holy Desires,</HI> and the Daily ones, of this Young Woman, were the Things that filled Hundreds of

Company,</HI> and cause me to Love <HI>Serious Company.</HI></P>
<P>Grant, that I may manifest my <HI>Love</HI> to God, by my <HI>Hatred</HI> of Sin; and grant, that I may fear <HI>Sin,</HI> more than <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>Grant, that I may know (and that I may be very Sollicitous to know,) what <HI>Errand</HI> my <HI>Afflictions</HI> come of, and that my <HI>Afflictions</HI> may do the <HI>Errand</HI> they come of; and that the Fruit of all my <HI>Afflictions</HI> may be, to <HI>take away Sin;</HI> and that I may <HI>Chuse Affliction</HI> rather than Sin. And grant, that I may be Thankful for those <HI>Afflictions,</HI> that do make me more <HI>Holy;</HI> and that I may have Grace, and Wisdom and Patience, to bear <HI>Afflictions</HI> as I ought, and to <HI>take up my Cress!</HI></P>
<P>Grant, that I may Mourn for the <HI>Wickedness</HI> of the <HI>Whole World;</HI> and that I may be Weaned from <HI>this World▪</HI> and that I may be very willing to Leave this Wicked and Wretched World, whenever God shall call me to Leave it!</P>
<P>The Lord be my own and bless me
<PB N="43" REF="001508_0046_0FB381330FD4FA80"/>
Bless me with Spiritual Blessings, &amp; ena∣ble me in the first &amp; chief place to desire those Blessings. And the Lord add to me those Temporal Blessings which I stand in need of. He knows what I want and what is best for me. I de∣sire to cast all my care upon Him, and to put my trust in Him who has bid me be careful for nothing, but in every thing with Prayer and Thanks∣giving to let my requests be made known to Him. <HI>The Lord keep me from Sin.</HI></P></Q>
<P>I was going on; — But the <HI>Swell</HI> of the work, which will be Lost if it be not Confined unto <HI>Narrow Limits,</HI> for∣bids my proceeding any further. So much of the <HI>Oyl in the Vessel,</HI> may suffice to answer the present Intention. I only say; First, I do very Solemnly Declare, That I have been careful not to <HI>Add One Word,</HI> unto the Writings from which I have been thus Transcri∣bing. It must also be Remembred, that it is not an <HI>Able Divine,</HI> but a <HI>Little Damsel,</HI> whose Writings are here Transcribed. Furthermore, In these
<PB N="44" REF="001508_0047_0FB3813490576920"/>
Few Passages, there are the main <HI>Li∣neaments</HI> of the <HI>New Creature,</HI> and of a <HI>Work of Grace</HI> in a Mind Renewed, and Sanctified, and Purified by the Spirit of God. They that have the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> will Rejoyce when they see these things, and Read them with an Allu∣bescence of Heart, as finding them∣selves wound up to an <HI>Unison</HI> with them. Finally. The <HI>View</HI> of these Dispositions, may by the Blessing of God, be helpful, and be honoured with some Instrumentality, to produce, or maintain the like in others; Especi∣ally in Persons of the same <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Sex</HI> with her, from whom we have the Dispositions of Piety, in such Li∣ving Exhibitions of it. An Effect pre∣ferrible to the best Cure ever affirm'd to be wrought by <HI>Macrina,</HI> the Sister of <HI>Basil,</HI> whom <HI>Gregory Nyssen</HI> hath so <HI>Panegyrized</HI> unto! And if it should be so; a <HI>Desire</HI> of hers, more than Once or Twice occurring in her <HI>Diary,</HI> will be happily answered. <HI>There,</HI> mention∣ing her Hopes of her own <HI>Conversion;</HI> she adds, <HI>Enable me to do what I ought,
<PB N="45" REF="001508_0048_0FB381360FF21B88"/>
that others may be Converted also!</HI> Having mention'd her Hopes of having her own Soul <HI>Wun</HI> to and by her Saviour, She adds; <HI>Enable me to do what I ought, that Others may be Wun to Serve Christ!</HI> Ah, Dear Child; It is now doing, be∣yond what thy Humble Soul could have Imagined! There is one thing more, not improper to be mentioned, She had an heart set to <HI>do Good</HI> accor∣ding to the utmost of her Capacity: and more particularly, She was of a <HI>Liberal disposition;</HI> She <HI>Devised Liberal Things.</HI> When she sent (as now and then she did) her Little <HI>Ventures to Sea,</HI> at the return she would be sure to lay aside the <HI>Tenth</HI> of her gain for <HI>Pious Uses.</HI> After she was in a <HI>Married Estate</HI> she was according to her ability very Liberally Charitable to the Poor; <HI>Considered the Poor.</HI></P>
<P N="8">§ 8. IT is Evident from her Memo∣rial, that she received many and Wondrous <HI>Answers of Prayer.</HI> There is no need of their being so Publickly Exposed, as they must be, if they make
<PB N="46" REF="001508_0049_0FB381378FF78E10"/>
any part of this Relation. Only, Let <HI>Young Persons</HI> be Encouraged from her Example and Experience. <HI>Children,</HI> You will doubtless find what she did; <HI>The Lord is Good unto them that Wait for Him, unto the Soul that Seeks Him.</HI></P>
<P>However, One Important Article, shall not be left unmentioned. I find it an Article of <HI>Prayer,</HI> frequently Rei∣terated with her; <HI>That I may Dy Be∣lievingly, Willingly, and Joyfully.</HI> And else-where, <HI>That I may thro' Christ ob∣tain the Victory over Death, and over my Fears of Death.</HI> Yea, Sometimes it soars to this. <HI>The Lord grant, that I may have such Fore-sights and Fore-tasts of the Joyes of Heaven, as may cause me to long to be there.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Reader, Expect a very Sur∣prising Issue!</P>
<P>Her <HI>Travail</HI> drew nigh; and she had been so Indisposed, that her Friends were doubtful of the Consequences. The last Words, that ever she Wrote were these.</P>
<P>Dec. 16. 1710. <HI>I am Every Day ex∣pecting my Travail. The Lord keep me
<PB N="47" REF="001508_0050_0FB381390FB23BF8"/>
from Sin; And be with me, when my Tra∣vail comes, and Deliver me for the Sake of Christ, who was born of a Woman. Grant, that I may put my Trust in Christ, and not Fear. Let my Fears be Prevented, for the Sake of my Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The Prayer-hearing Lord, was mar∣vellously Gracious to her. The Day following, she was Delivered; and there has rarely been known a more <HI>Easy Travail,</HI> of a <HI>First-born Infant.</HI> The Lord also answered her Prayers in giving her the comprehensive Mercy of a <HI>Perfect Child;</HI> which when Bap∣tized had her <HI>Mothers Name</HI> given to her, but dyed the Week after her Mo∣ther; and now Sleeps in the same Tomb with her.</P>
<P>After her Comfortable Travail, all that Week, there was great Hope of her being Shortly &amp; Safely Recovered. But on the next Lords-Day, a Sudden <HI>Change</HI> appeared on her.</P>
<P>And a <HI>Change</HI> indeed!</P>
<P>She had been of a Timerous and Melancholy Constitution; which might somewhat contribute, unto that
<PB N="48" REF="001508_0051_0FB3813A92D94970"/>
<HI>Fear of Death,</HI> which had all her <HI>Life-time</HI> very much kept her in <HI>Bondage.</HI> But now, to our Astonishment, she told those who attended her; <HI>She was sure, the Time for her Death was now come; And she was now above that Fear of it, that she had heretofore been Subject to.</HI></P>
<P>It is not the Portion of all the Chil∣dren of God, to Dy with Triumphant <HI>Joyes.</HI> Very Eminent Servants of God, have, with Holy <HI>Bains,</HI> declared on their Death-beds, that tho' they have Enjoy'd a <HI>Calm</HI> of Soul, yet they had no uncommon <HI>Joyes.</HI> Yea, Some∣times they have rather Suffered some Dejection, some Despondency of Mind▪ Pious <HI>Throgmorton</HI> when Dying, asked the famous <HI>Dod,</HI> What <HI>shall be thought of a Dying man, who has not the Light of the Countenance of God shining on him?</HI> Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> replied, What <HI>shall be thought of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who when He was a Dying Said,</HI> My God, My God, <HI>Why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> This Thought revived him. On the other side, It is the Portion of Some, to go away Tri∣umphing unto the Heavenly World.
<PB N="49" REF="001508_0052_0FB3813C1087EF00"/>
So did our Great <HI>Ames,</HI> unto the Asto∣nishment of a Popish Physician; who asked, <HI>Whether Protestants did use to Dy after that manner!</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>Holland,</HI> thus Dr. <HI>Winter,</HI> had such <HI>Views</HI> and <HI>Joyes</HI> of Heaven in their Dying Hours, That they Scarce knew, whether they were <HI>in the Body, or out of the Body.</HI> Yea, Some Handmaids of the Lord have had such Experiences; The <HI>Fearful Sex</HI> have Triumphed over the <HI>King of Fears.</HI> Dying Mrs. <HI>Stubbs</HI> said unto those a∣bout her, <HI>O that you did but see what I see! I see Millions of Angels; whom God has appointed to carry my Soul to Heaven.</HI> Dying Mrs. <HI>Brettergh</HI> said, <HI>O the Joyes! the Joyes! the Joyes that I feel! They are Wonderful, they are Wonderful, they are Wonderful!</HI></P>
<P>And so our Dying JERUSHA!— When she certainly knew, that she was to Dy, she said unto those about her; <HI>Here is a Strange Thing! when I was in Health, Death was a Terror to me. But now I know, I shall Dy. I am not at all afraid of it.</HI> She said, <HI>This is a Wonder∣ful Work of God! I know, that I am going
<PB N="50" REF="001508_0053_0FB3813D8FAB69E0"/>
to Christ: That I shall shortly be in the Heavenly Jerusalem, with an Innumerable Company of Angels, and among the Spirits of Just Men made Perfect.</HI> Said she; <HI>I see things that are Unutterable!</HI> Then she Sang for Joy. And yet in her whole Discourse had nothing that Look'd at all Delirious. Her Father, at her De∣sire coming to her, found her in an Ecstasy of Joy; Saying, <HI>O the Glory of Heaven! O the Glory of Heaven! O the Glory of Heaven! I see a Glory, which can∣not be Express'd; Persons and Things, which I want a Language to declare what they are!</HI> She desired a Message to be carried from her, unto her Sister at <HI>Roxbury;</HI> That <HI>she should be sure, not to be afraid of Dying.</HI> Her Father said unto her; <HI>Why? Are not you afraid of Death?</HI> She replied with great Ear∣nestness; <HI>Not in the Least! Not in the Least! Not in the Least!</HI></P>
<P>I can readily Suppose, that the Force of <HI>Imagination</HI> will sometimes carry People into Strange Transports. And I can heartily Subscribe to the Words of our <HI>Jerusha's</HI> famous Uncle, Mr.
<PB N="51" REF="001508_0054_0FB3813F105361E0"/>
<HI>Samuel Mather,</HI> late Pastor of a Congre∣gation in <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the first Preacher in the North Congregation in <HI>Boston,</HI> (in his Book of, <HI>The Types.</HI> p. 42.) <HI>I had rather have a little Solid Comfort, in that Good old plain Scripture way of Faith and Repentance, and Labouring with my own Heart to apply the Promises; And I value this more than if an Angel should ap∣pear to me out of Heaven, to tell me, that I am a Child of God. I am sure, that if I walk closely with God, if I exercise my self unto Godliness, and unto Communion with Him, in Faith and Prayer, and in Seeking of Him, and Humbling my self before Him daily, I am sure, that in this way I cannot miscarry.</HI> Yet the same Judicious Per∣son adds, <HI>I would not advise Believers, utterly to reject all Comforts, where there is possibly something of Enthusiasm inter∣mixt, if there be a Suitableness to their Con∣dition in the Promises brought to their Hand in such a way, and there be a Relish of the Gospel, and the Promises and Blessings of it.</HI> And sometimes these <HI>Raptures</HI> are so circumstanced as to carry upon them the plain <HI>Signatures</HI> of an <HI>Angelical
<PB N="52" REF="001508_0055_0FB3814092157888"/>
Operation.</HI> Especially when they are in Persons never known to be on the least subject to <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> or to any thing of a Rapturous Nature, but much the contrary, as it was with our <HI>Je∣rusha.</HI></P>
<P>These Raptures did not continue many Hours. Her Flights were some∣what abated. The <HI>Solid Comfort</HI> her Uncle Speaks of, contented her; yet she never had any <HI>Dread of Death</HI> on her Spirit after this Day. Some Days afterwards her Father asked her, Whe∣ther she were still <HI>Willing to Dy?</HI> Her Answer was; <HI>Tis Natural to desire Life; but I am willing to be at Gods Disposal, Whether it be for Life, or Death.</HI> As she drew near her End, She Signified, both unto her Father, and unto her Bro∣ther; That she <HI>Hoped she was now going to Heaven.</HI> On Dec. 30. in the Night, after she had been for some time Speechless, her Speech unexpectedly Returned so far, that she desired, Her Father might Pray with her, <HI>That she might be quickly in the Kingdom of God.</HI> He did so; and bless'd God for giving
<PB N="53" REF="001508_0056_0FB38142DC582E08"/>
him such a Daughter, and gave her back unto the Lord. She continued above the Fear of Death; and One of her Last audible words was, <HI>I am in Distress to be gone!</HI> So she <HI>fell Asleep</HI> in JESUS.</P>
<P>It is no Unusual Thing, for Pray∣ing Ones, who have been much <HI>Afraid of Death,</HI> in the time of their Health, to be Strangely carried above it, as their <HI>Death</HI> approaches. Our <HI>Jerusha</HI> had an Excellent Grand-mother, (her Fa∣thers Mother,) who was One Remar∣kable Instance of this Observation. She was a Gentlewoman of rare Piety; and One who spent much Time in Reading, and in Meditation and Sup∣plication, and Communion with God. Nevertheless, She was for many years much afraid of Dying; and particu∣larly fearful, that the <HI>Pangs of Death</HI> would prove terrible, and very grievous and painful. It pleased God, that the Event proved much otherwise than she feared She dyed Easily; and fill'd with Divine and Holy Joy. She
<PB N="54" REF="001508_0057_0FB381444FC166C8"/>
left the World with those Words; <HI>Eye has not seen, Ear has not heard, neither entred into the Heart of Man, the things which God has prepared for them that Love Him!</HI></P>
<Q><L>DEATH,</L>
<L><HI>More like a</HI> Prince of Life, <HI>than</HI> King of Fears,</L>
<L><HI>Said,</HI> Now I'm come, to answer all thy Prayers, and Tears.</L></Q>
<P>Thus <HI>Nazianzen</HI> in his Funeral Ora∣tion on his Devout Sister, seems to Report it with Raptures, that she dyed Singing of those Words; Psal. IV. 8.</P>
<Q><L>In Peace with <HI>GOD</HI> ly down I will;</L>
<L>My Quiet Sleep I'l take.</L>
<L>In Glad Assurance me to Dwell,</L>
