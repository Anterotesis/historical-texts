<P>SOME Eminent Protestant Divines, as <HI>Nye,</HI> and <HI>Sherwood,</HI> have Ex∣pressed some Dislike for <HI>Funeral Sermons;</HI> And thus, the Famous <HI>Cartwright,</HI> supposing them to come in the room of <HI>Trentals.</HI> In some Reformed Churches, as those of <HI>Holland,</HI> there have been Decrees of Councils against them; And the <HI>Ecclesiastical Discipline</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> Churches did Prohibit them. But their Design was rather to Restrain the <HI>Abuse,</HI> than to Condemn the <HI>Ʋse</HI> of them. They were commonly fill'd with Immo∣derate and Untrue Praises of the Dead; and <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> pretends to give us
<PB REF="001365_0003_0FB2926773AD2428"/>
the Original of such <HI>Orations.</HI> The Re∣nowned <HI>Hildersham</HI> therefore Ordered, That there should be no <HI>Funeral Sermon</HI> for him. So did the Pious and Humble Mr. <HI>Carter</HI> of <HI>Bramford; Left</HI> (said he) <HI>something be said in my Praise, beyond what is the Truth, and so I should occasion a Minister in his Pulpit, to speak an Ʋntruth, which would be a grievous Sin.</HI> His Execu∣tors observed his <HI>Will:</HI> But this hindred not Mr. <HI>Samuel Ward</HI> (the Glory of <HI>Ipswich,</HI>) from Employing his next Lecture in Lamentations for the Loss, which the Church of God, sustained in the Death of a Person of such Eminence and Use∣fulness. The <HI>Death</HI> of Men that have been <HI>Publick Blessings,</HI> ought Publickly to be taken notice of. The <HI>Elegy</HI> which <HI>David</HI> made upon <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> was a <HI>Funeral Sermon.</HI></P>
<P>My Relation to the Author, forbids me to Recommend the <HI>Funeral Sermon,</HI> which is here Published. The Design of it, is, more to Instruct the <HI>Living,</HI> than to Embalm the <HI>Dead.</HI> The Reader will find no <HI>Encomiums</HI> here, but what all
<PB REF="001365_0004_0FB2926C86DD6E58"/>
know to be True. The Grandfather of the Gentleman, here spoken of, was the <HI>First Governour,</HI> that <HI>New-England</HI> saw at the Head of the <HI>Massachuset</HI>-Colony. Nor was there ever any Governour, a Greater Blessing to the Colony. <HI>Win∣throp</HI> and <HI>Cotton</HI> (between whom there was the Greatest Intimacy,) were the Chief Instruments in the Hand of CHRIST, for Laying the Foundations, both of our <HI>Civil,</HI> and our <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Constitution. His Honourable Father never will be for∣gotten by the Colony of <HI>Connecticut:</HI> It was by his Means, that their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for them. His Name and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was known in other Lands, as well as throughout <HI>New-England.</HI> I had the Happiness and Honour of a special Acquaintance with him; to which there was added this agreeable Circumstance, That I was the only Person in <HI>New-England,</HI> who had part of my Education in the same University, where he had his many Years before; namely, The Colledge of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="001365_0005_0FB2926D749983E0"/>It must be alwayes Acknowledged, That this SON of that Excellent Per∣son, did <HI>Patrissare,</HI> in respect of his Pub∣lick Spirit, and Sedulous and Successful Endeavours, to obtain a <HI>Confirmation</HI> of those Priviledges for his Countrey, which his Father had obtained for them. And there was this Addition to his Honourable Character; (which ought to be every mans Ambition,) That his <HI>Last Dayes</HI> were his <HI>Best Dayes.</HI></P>

The Re¦petition of it is this Day to be carried on▪ God grant, that it may be with a Good and Great Effect upon this very Numerous Auditory!</P>
<P>We have before as, <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Antediluvian World▪</HI> Probably <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pre∣served in the <HI>Ʋpper Story</HI> of the <HI>Ark,</HI> such Writings and Records, as might furnish that admirable Historian <HI>Moses,</HI> with Ma¦terials for this Ancient History.</P>
<P>It was a curious Meditation of the Bles∣sed <HI>Austin;</HI> That there are <HI>Two Societies,</HI> among the Children of Men; There are the Children of <HI>Cain,</HI> &amp; there are the Chil∣dren of <HI>Seth.</HI> In the Antediluvian <HI>Chro∣nicles,</HI> the <HI>Cainites</HI> and the <HI>Sethites,</HI> give us a Type of what is carrying on to the End
<PB N="5" REF="001365_0008_0FB295B106B302F8"/>
of the World. Among the <HI>Cainites,</HI> you find, They <HI>Built Cities;</HI> they proposed fix∣ed, settled, lasting <HI>Habitations</HI> upon <HI>Earth.</HI> About the Biggest part of them, you find <HI>Nothing spoken</HI> at all; They <HI>did Nothing</HI> worthy to be spoken of. Yet, you find <HI>Arts</HI> Cultivated among them; Some of them are Notable <HI>Artists,</HI> and Learned men; and by their Learning they obtain a <HI>Name</HI> for themselves. The Great Light of <HI>Africa,</HI> carries on his Remarks; and from the <HI>Women</HI> mentioned among the <HI>Cainites,</HI> he reflects, <HI>Terrenam Civitatem Carnales habi∣turam Generationes.</HI> But now, among the <HI>Sethites,</HI> it seems, as if they lived more like <HI>Pilgrims</HI> and <HI>Strangers</HI> on the Earth. We read of no <HI>Cities</HI> among them. They look for the <HI>Heavenly City;</HI> the place that <HI>Enoch</HI> went unto. All their Hopes, all their Joys, are upon what is in the <HI>Heavens</HI> reserved for them. Among the <HI>Arabian</HI> Writers, you will find surprising Traditions, That they maintained a most intimate Commu∣nion with the <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD. But I must not impose Quotations from <HI>Elmaecinus</HI> &amp; <HI>Patricides,</HI> upon the present Auditory.</P>
<P>Well; Since these Two <HI>Setts,</HI> Two <HI>Sorts,</HI> Two <HI>Societies,</HI> are continued in the
<PB N="6" REF="001365_0009_0FB295B28646A4C8"/>
world unto this Day under their different Characters; My Hearers, make a <HI>wise Choice</HI> for your selves; <HI>Chuse</HI> with whom you will <HI>Associate</HI> your selves. <HI>Chuse</HI> the People with whom you would be <HI>Gathered</HI> as your <HI>own People.</HI> Tis impossible to Ad∣dress you with an Exhortation of a great¦er Importance! Methinks, The Conside¦ration which is now brought from the Story of a <HI>Sethite,</HI> should Awaken us. <HI>Death, Death,</HI> which you see <HI>Reigning from Adam,</HI> over the Ensuing Generations: the Consideration of Universal <HI>Death,</HI> Una¦voidable <HI>Death;</HI> Oh! How should it <HI>En¦liven</HI> our Piety!</P>
<P>In the <HI>Holy Line</HI> of the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> single out one Exemple of <HI>Mortality,</HI> to be at this time Discoursed on; Tis one whose Name was <HI>Enosh▪</HI></P>
<P>That I single him out; One of my Rea∣sons is, Because he was a GRAND-SON in a Famous Family. First <HI>Adam</HI> appears; a Worshipper of GOD; a Believer on CHRIST; the GOVERNOUR anon of a Little World. Then <HI>Seth</HI> appears; the <HI>Substitute</HI> and <HI>Follower</HI> of a Righteous <HI>Abel;</HI> and one that had on all accounts upon him, the <HI>Image</HI> of his <HI>Father:</HI> Now comes
<PB N="7" REF="001365_0010_0FB295B4127EF088"/>
on the Grandson, <HI>Enosh,</HI> of whom little more is Reported but this, <HI>And he Died.</HI> Indeed one thing more is in the Report; which is by some thus translated; <HI>Then began to be Profaned the Name of the Lord.</HI> This Person Lived, it seems, to see much <HI>Profanity</HI> and <HI>Apostasy</HI> to gain upon a Sin∣ful World. Others rather keeping to our own Translation, <HI>Then began men to Call on the Name of the Lord,</HI> suppose that <HI>Congre∣gations</HI> were formed for the Service of God; and one <HI>Enosh</HI> was a Great Encou∣rager of them. Yea, some read it, <HI>Then began Preaching in the Name of the Lord;</HI> The Hebrew word, (from whence comes the Greek word for <HI>Preaching,</HI>) favours it. Probably <HI>Enosh</HI> was one who heartily Countenanced the Best Preachers. Our <HI>Enosh</HI> would have such for his <HI>Counsellors.</HI> Tis more than probable, That the <HI>Pro∣tevangelium,</HI> in the <HI>Third of Genesis and the Fifteenth,</HI> was the Text most usually Preach'd upon.</P>
<P>Tis an happy and a lovely Sight some∣times Exhibited, in the World; The <HI>same Family</HI> sometimes has afforded Eminent and Renowned men, successively for <HI>Three Generations.</HI> It was accounted a Singular
<PB N="8" REF="001365_0011_0FB295B5740BE9E0"/>
Honour to the Family of the <HI>Curij</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> that there arose from that Stock, Three Excellent <HI>Orators</HI> one succeeding another. More than One Family in this Land have had the Greater Honour, of yielding Three <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel one succeeding a∣nother. But the Family of the WIN¦THROPS, has this way something very <HI>Peculiar</HI> in it. Three JOHN WIN¦THROPS, a <HI>Father,</HI> and a <HI>Son,</HI> and a <HI>Grandson,</HI> have by the <HI>Election</HI> of the Peo∣ple, been made GOVERNOURS over a People of God; And after all their <HI>Service in their Generation falling Asleep,</HI> they must not without a sensible Interposal of the Divine Providence to bring it about, ly<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together Encombed in the same <HI>Sleeping-Place</HI> and <HI>Sepulchre.</HI> There is not such another TOMB to be seen in all <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>One of the <HI>Seven Wonders</HI> of the world, was a TOMB. <HI>This</HI> may be Esteemed One of the <HI>American</HI> world.</P>
<P>Another of my Reasons, is, Because I must make a profitable Reflection on the Name of my <HI>Enosh.</HI> It has been com∣monly thought, That the Name of <HI>Enosh,</HI> is as much as to say, <HI>Sorrowful</HI> Man, <HI>Af∣flicted</HI> Man, <HI>Miserable</HI> Man. Alas, In the
<PB N="9" REF="001365_0012_0FB295B6F151BB80"/>
<HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation</HI> which every day be∣fals every man, there is Enough and E∣nough to Justify such a Denomination. But I forego the Thought. <HI>Eusebius</HI> has better instructed me, That <HI>Enosh</HI> rather signifies, EPILESMONA, <HI>Forgetful</HI> Man, or <HI>Forgotten</HI> Man. Truly, the wretched∣ness of <HI>Man</HI> lies very much in <HI>Forgetfulness.</HI> For, first, <HI>Man</HI> did soon <HI>Forget</HI> his Obliga∣tions to God, and continues to do so. Se∣condly, If <HI>Old Age</HI> comes upon a <HI>Man,</HI> he soon grows very <HI>Forgetful</HI> of Every thing; and it is a principal Infirmity and Cala∣mity of <HI>Old Age</HI> thus to do. Thirdly, It is the Fate of a <HI>Man</HI> to be soon <HI>Forgotten;</HI> he appears a very little while, and it is quickly <HI>Forgotten,</HI> that ever he was in the World. Behold, the Elegancy of a pas∣sage in the Psalms, where the Name of <HI>Enosh</HI> is used; Psal. 8.4. <HI>What is Forget∣ful and Forgotten Man, that thou shouldest Remember him!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Enosh</HI> indeed is a Name-sake for every man, in this Assembly. But, O <HI>Man,</HI> of whatsoever thou art <HI>Forgetful,</HI> do not <HI>For∣get</HI> this; <HI>And he Died;</HI> Oh! Do not <HI>For∣get</HI> this Maxim, which we are now going to insist upon;</P>
<Q><PB N="10" REF="001365_0013_0FB295B8ED8D4140"/>Fallen Man is Mortal.</Q>
<P>There is no man <HI>Living,</HI> but anon this Account must be given of him, <HI>He Died;</HI> this Account, <HI>He's Dead.</HI> Or, if you will rather have the DOCTRINE, in the Ex∣press words of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> take it so; Psal 89 48. <HI>What Man is he that Liveth, and shall not see Death?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Antediluvians</HI> indeed, were com∣paratively <HI>Long Lived</HI> People.

<PB N="11" REF="001365_0014_0FB295BD418B85E8"/>
but a very <HI>Little, Little</HI> while; A <HI>Time</HI> that may be measured by a <HI>Span;</HI> Tho' according to the ancient <HI>Arithmetick of the Hand,</HI> wherein the <HI>Little Finger</HI> of the Right Hand Contracted, signified an <HI>Hun∣dred,</HI> it is well if it prove <HI>Half a Little Finger;</HI> before every one of us has ar∣rived unto the <HI>Period</HI> of his Life; <HI>And he Died.</HI> The GOVERNOUR of <HI>Israel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, <HI>Our Dayes on Earth are as a Shadow, and there is none Abiding.</HI> Another GO∣VERNOUR invites us now to insist upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Every Living man may say with him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b 30.23. <HI>I know that thou wilt bring me <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Death.</HI> Tho' Ordinarily we do not know, the <HI>Time</HI> of our <HI>Death;</HI> nor the <HI>Way</HI> of our <HI>Death;</HI> yet every man must certainly <HI>Know,</HI> That <HI>God will bring him to Death.</HI> Tho' a man be never so <HI>Ignorant</HI> of other Things, yet this <HI>One Thing,</HI> he cannot but <HI>Know</HI> most certainly, That <HI>God will bring him to Death.</HI></P>

<P N="1">I. We have the <HI>Admonitions</HI> of our <HI>Death,</HI> dispensed unto us in the <HI>Lively Oracles</HI> of GOD. The infallible Word of GOD, has with Repeted Thunder∣claps, infallibly assured us, <HI>That we are

<P>We are assured in the Word of GOD, That <HI>Good Men</HI> as well as others, must un∣dergo the stroke of <HI>Death.</HI> We read, Job 14.1. <HI>Man that is Born of a Woman, is of Few dayes.</HI> By, <HI>Man that is Born of a Woman,</HI> may perhaps be understood, that <HI>Religious</HI> and <HI>Regenerate</HI> part of Mankind, who at the beginning of the Bible, are called, <HI>The Seed of the Woman;</HI> [of her, who is called, <HI>The Mother of all the Living;</HI>] The People that belong to Him, who is the Principal and the Promised <HI>Seed of the Wo∣man:</HI>

<P>We have the <HI>Law of Death,</HI> Declared and Pronounced, in the Word of GOD: A <HI>Law</HI> ten thousand times more unaltera∣ble, than any one of the <HI>Medes and Per∣sians.</HI> Let us turn to the <HI>Law;</HI> Gen. 3.19. <HI>Dust thou art, and to Dust thou shalt Return.

The <HI>Experience</HI> of <HI>dying Mankind, Admonishes</HI> all men to be mindful of it, <HI>That they are also to Dye.</HI> O most over∣whelming <HI>Admonition!</HI> Since <HI>all Mankind</HI> in every Age has <HI>Died</HI> before us, and is every Day <HI>Dying</HI> about us, that man is a <HI>Bruit</HI> rather than a <HI>Man,</HI> who Dreams, that he shall Escape the <HI>common Lot of Mankind.</HI> We read; Eccl. 1.4. <HI>One Ge∣neration passeth away, and another cometh.</HI> Yea, and the <HI>Generation</HI> that <HI>Cometh,</HI> we see also <HI>Passing away.</HI> There have never been a∣bove <HI>Two men,</HI> that have Escaped the <HI>Common Lot,</HI> for more than Five Thousand Years, which have rolled away since the <HI>day that God made Man upon the Earth.</HI> The Empire of <HI>Death</HI> is an <HI>Ʋniversal Monarchy.</HI> The <HI>King of Terrors</HI> is a <HI>Mo∣narch</HI> so Great, that he alwayes has the Sun both Rising and Setting in his Dominions. On the whole Face of the Earth it may be, there are about <HI>Five Hundred Millions</HI> of People. In a few Years, there will no be <HI>One</HI> of them left!

<HI>as Drought and Heat Consume the Snow-waters.</HI> Our Sinful Earth, has never af∣forded, any <HI>Priviledged Place</HI> unto the Children of men, where the <HI>Arrest</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> could not come at them. Has <HI>Holiness</HI> Exempted any man? Truly, No. The Holy <HI>Moses</HI> must have it said, <HI>Mo∣ses my Servant is Dead.</HI> Has <HI>Courage</HI> done it? No; <HI>David</HI> was a Brave man; <HI>And he Died.</HI> Has <HI>Vigour</HI> done it: No; <HI>Sampson</HI> was a Strong man; <HI>And he Died.</HI> Has <HI>Wisdom</HI> done it?

No; <HI>Ahashuerus</HI> was a Rich man; <HI>And he Died.</HI> Have the <HI>Best Qualities</HI> imaginable, preserved any man so Invulnerable, that the Arrows of <HI>Death</HI> could not come at him? No; As Useful, as Humble, as Lovely a man as <HI>Paul,</HI> a man that had been both in <HI>Para∣dise,</HI> and in the <HI>Third Heaven</HI> too, must have a <HI>Time of departure: <HI>And he Died.</HI></HI> Every Generation feels the Fulfilment of that Prophecy; Isa. 24.1. <HI>Behold, the Lord makes the Earth Empty.</HI></P>
<P>My Hearers, I will put you into a way to pursue this Thought, with a most affecting Pungency! Pass over the several

Streets of your Neighbourhood. Stay; — Call to mind a Little: — Who Liv'd in such an House, — and who in such an One, — so many Years ago? — But, where are they now? Oh! They are <HI>Gone!</HI> They are <HI>Gone!</HI> The <HI>Places that have known them, shall know them no more. <HI>Death</HI></HI> has carried them off into the other <HI>World.</HI> — We are deprived of our Senses, if we do not now make that Con∣clusion; Isa. 20 6. <HI>And how shall we Escape?</HI> No, Never think of such a thing!</P>

Every Day we may perceive <HI>Death</HI> growing upon us. What are all our <HI>Bodily distempers?</HI> They are but so many Advances of <HI>Death.</HI> In all our <HI>distempers. <HI>Death</HI></HI> is hacking and hewing down our <HI>Tabernacle.</HI> The <HI>E∣nemy</HI> has broken in, and is breaking down, <HI>the Carved work thereof, with Axes and Hammers.</HI> These things are the <HI>Messen∣gers of Death.</HI> A <HI>Wrathful King</HI> is at hand.

The Term of, <HI>Mortis Caduceatores,</HI> has been justly put upon them. We read, Job 30 22, 23. <HI>Thou dissolvest my Substance; I know thou wilt bring me to Death.</HI> He <HI>Knew</HI> it, because he found a <HI>dissolution</HI> already begun upon him. O Man, Thy <HI>dissolution</HI> is already at work upon thee.</P>
<P>Ingenious was the Parable of the An∣cients. A man made an Agreement with <HI>Death,</HI> never to call for him till he had first <HI>Warned</HI> him of it. At length, <HI>Death</HI> does call for him; and the man Expostu∣lates, That he was not <HI>Warned</HI> according to Agreement. <HI>Say not so,</HI> replies <HI>Death, <HI>Say not so!

<P>Indeed all the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> are cal∣led by the Name of <HI>Death.</HI> I am sure, They tell us, <HI>That we are to die.</HI>

Yea, The very <HI>Supports</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> carry broad Intimations of our <HI>Dying</HI> in them. We <HI>Die,</HI> if we don't now and then go to <HI>Sleep.</HI> That very <HI>Sleep</HI> is the <HI>Shadow of death.</HI> Oh! Fall <HI>Asleep</HI> with such Con∣templations; <HI>These Eyes must shortly be Closed by <HI>Death!</HI> These Limbs must shortly ly down in the Grave.</HI> Our <HI>Bread</HI> is the <HI>Staff of Life.</HI> If it were not for that <HI>Staff,</HI> we should soon fall down unto the <HI>Earth,</HI> into the <HI>Earth,</HI> from whence we <HI>fetch our Bread.</HI> Will it alwayes keep us from <HI>Falling?</HI> No; it sayes, <HI>My Friend, whence I came, thither art thou going.</HI> A Great part of the <HI>Food</HI> on which we <HI>Live,</HI> is the Flesh of <HI>dead Creatures.</HI> We have <HI>Death Death,</HI> Dish'd out unto us, on our Tables; DEATH in almost every <HI>dish.</HI> Oh! <HI>Feed</HI> with such Contempla∣tions; <HI>Feed</HI> on them too; <HI>Most certainly, I cannot alwayes Live upon the dead. Most certainly, dead Creatures can't save me always from Death.</HI></P>
<P>We see the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Mortality,</HI> un∣der some of its <HI>Demonstrations.</HI> But our <HI>Main Work</HI> this Day, and indeed the <HI>Main Work</HI> of every man, every Day of

his Life, must be to make some Good <HI>Improvement</HI> of such a <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Must we Die?</HI> Then we should Live in a Daily <HI>Expectation</HI> of our <HI>Death.</HI> A Ser∣vant of God could say, 1 Cor. 15.31. <HI>I die daily.</HI> One thing in <HI>dying daily,</HI> is to Live with some Expectation <HI>every day,</HI> as if this may be the <HI>day of our death.</HI> I do not say, <HI>That a man should Live every day, as if he knew it were to be the day of his death.</HI> A strain, whereof the Expres∣sion should be a little mended. We may very truly and justly, and fairly thus Ex∣press it; <HI>We should Live every day, as not knowing but that it may be the day of our death.</HI> We know, <HI>That we are to die;</HI> But yet we may say with him; Gen. 27.2. <HI>I know not the Time of my death.</HI> We do <HI>not Know,</HI> but <HI>this Week,</HI> nay, <HI>this Day,</HI> may be <HI>the Time.</HI> Every <HI>Prayer</HI> we make, we may think, <HI>It may be this is the Last Prayer that ever I shall make.</HI> Every <HI>Ser∣mon</HI> we hear, we may think, <HI>It may be this is the Last Sermon that ever I shall hear.</HI> Every time we are Conversing with our <HI>Friends,</HI> we may think, <HI>This, may be the Last Time of my Conversation with these
<PB N="23" REF="001365_0025_0FB295D5B6198490"/>
Friends.</HI> And we may let fall some Weighty, some Useful Sentence unto them, upon that Suspicion: Every Day we may think; <HI>Tis possible I may not Live to ano∣ther Day.</HI> So we are taught; Prov. 27.1. <HI>Boast not thy self of To-morrow; for thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> Such Thoughts, Verily, They should be very Frequent with us! Even <HI>Philosophy</HI> tells us, <HI>That the whole Course of our Life, should be a Meditation on <HI>Death.</HI></HI> But then, Let us call in <HI>Divinity.</HI> This will prescribe, <HI>A Living to God,</HI> as the <HI>Preparation for <HI>Death,</HI></HI> which must be joyn'd with the <HI>Meditation</HI> of it. And this I am now to proceed unto.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Must we Dye?</HI> Then our Speedy, our Thorough <HI>Preparation</HI> for <HI>Death,</HI> is the ONE THING, that is needful for us. That Word of Command, is now given out, <HI>Make all Ready.</HI> Tis the Coun∣sel of Heaven unto us; Mat. 24.44. <HI>Be ye also Ready.</HI> Really, the <HI>Longest Life</HI> is little Enough, to be all spent, in <HI>making Ready for Death.</HI> Oh! It requires a mighty <HI>Preparation!</HI> Sirs, We ought im∣mediately to make sure of it, That when
<PB N="24" REF="001365_0026_0FB295D73531CC40"/>
our <HI>Death</HI> arrives, it shall not prove a <HI>Trap-door,</HI> to let us down into Wretched, and Woful, and Hopeless and Endless Con∣fusions. With a Message like that, Isa. 38.1. <HI>Set thy House in Order, for thou shalt Dye and not Live;</HI> I now come unto you, <HI>Set thy Soul in Order, for thou shalt shortly Die, thou hast not long to Live.</HI></P>
<P>Here lies the Merit of the Case. The <HI>Last Thing</HI> that we can say, of this or that Man, is, <HI>And he Died.</HI> But this will not be the <HI>Last Thing</HI> that will befal the man. There is a <HI>Future State.</HI> There is a State of <HI>Misery,</HI> or of <HI>Hap∣piness,</HI> after <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>Of a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> we read, Luk 16.22, 23. <HI>He died, and was buried, and in Hell he was in Torments.</HI> The <HI>Spirit</HI> of a Wicked man, is delivered over into the Hands of <HI>Devils.</HI> When one part of him, is <HI>Covered with the Shadow of Death,</HI> the other part of him is <HI>Broken in the place of Dragons.</HI> If the Relation might be given, it would be this; <Q><HI>And he Died:</HI> But then his Depraved <HI>Soul</HI> was cast into an horrid <HI>Prison,</HI> where it lies in <HI>Chains of Darkness,</HI> waiting with Horror, for the <HI>Eternal Judgment</HI> of GOD.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001365_0027_0FB295D8C0235AC8"/>Of a <HI>Godly Man,</HI> we read, Rev. 14.13 <HI>He is Blessed, and he does Rest.</HI> His <HI>Death</HI> deals by him, as the Wretches did by the Young Man in the Gospel; Catch the <HI>Gar∣ment;</HI> the <HI>Person</HI> does Escape. So the Relation must proceed, concerning the <HI>Spirit</HI> of a Godly Man, <Q><HI>And he Died:</HI> But when his <HI>Body is Dead because of Sin,</HI> his <HI>Spirit is Alive because of Righ∣teousness:</HI> His Renewed <HI>Soul</HI> puts on the <HI>Garments of Light:</HI> It fell into the Com∣pany of Holy <HI>Angels;</HI> and in the <HI>Paradise of God,</HI> it keeps Joyfully Feeding on its <HI>Tree of Life;</HI> Joyfully looking for the <HI>Ap∣pearance</HI> of the Great GOD our Saviour, when its Felicity will be Perfected, in the Rais'd and New <HI>Body</HI> to be bestow'd upon it.</Q></P>
<P>If these be the <HI>Consequences,</HI> Oh! What <HI>Preparation</HI> is to be Endeavoured?</P>
<P>And what is it that will Prepare us for <HI>Death;</HI> for <HI>Blessedness</HI> at our <HI>Death?</HI></P>
<P>In one word, It is <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD. It is that <HI>Good Work,</HI> whereof we read, Phil. 1.6. <HI>God hath begun a Good Work in you.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly, There are <HI>Three Points,</HI> which our Safety and our Comfort, at our <HI>Death,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001365_0028_0FB295DA711C8668"/>
will turn upon. I would propose them to the best Advantage. I will put them into the most Advantageous <HI>Form.</HI> I will offer them in the <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Resolutions;</HI> Hoping that you will come into these most Reasonable <HI>Resolutions, <HI>O all ye People, Every one of you.</HI></HI></P>
<P>First; <HI>Resolve</HI> thus; <Q><HI>I am to Die;</HI> Therefore I will now flie to the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, and plead it, and make it my <HI>Only Plea,</HI> that I may be delivered from the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin, and the <HI>Wrath</HI> of Heaven. I will now flie to the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, and Thankfully, Heartily, Hopefully Re∣ceive it, as the Incomparable <HI>Gift of Grace</HI> unto me, that I may Inherit the <HI>Blessedness of the Righteous.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Again; <HI>Resolve</HI> thus; <Q><HI>I am to Die;</HI> Therefore I will Resign my self up unto the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Lord, that all my <HI>En∣mity</HI> to God may be subdued; that I may Fear GOD, and Prize CHRIST, and Hate SIN, and <HI>Perfect Holiness in the Fear of God;</HI> that the <HI>Image of Satan</HI> may be Extirpated out of my Soul, and the <HI>Ho∣ly Image</HI> of the LORD Introduced, which may render me <HI>Meet for the
<PB N="27" REF="001365_0029_0FB295E06FF63A90"/>
Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></Q></P>
<P>All this is <HI>Habitual Preparation.</HI> An <HI>Actu∣al Preparation</HI> is also Necessary. Where∣fore,</P>
<P>Lastly; <HI>Resolve</HI> thus; <Q><HI>I am to Die;</HI> Therefore I will keep my <HI>Evidences for Everlasting Life</HI> so Clear, that the <HI>Sudden Approach</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> may produce no A∣mazement in my Soul. I would keep my <HI>Soul</HI> in such an <HI>Heavenly Frame,</HI> that no <HI>Sudden Approach</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> may find me Indisposed for the <HI>Heavenly World.</HI></Q></P>
<P>How inexcusably Remiss are they, what Remissness, what Sotti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hness, beyond an Epithet, are they Guilty of, who do not now come into these <HI>Resolutions!</HI> — I doubt, I have used a Term a little too Dilatory; that Term, <HI>I Will.</HI> Instead of, <HI>I Will,</HI> and all that may look like the least, <HI>Hereafter,</HI> in the Case, Oh! Let it all be done, <HI>Immediately!</HI> I say, <HI>Immediately!</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Must we Die?</HI> Then we ought <HI>Now</HI> to <HI>Do,</HI> what we shall at our <HI>Death, <HI>wish to have done.</HI></HI> Our <HI>Death</HI> will bring us to a <HI>Right Sense</HI> of Things. Oh! Let our <HI>Sense,</HI> that we are to <HI>Die,</HI> do so too! Men have the <HI>Clearest Sight</HI> of Things,
<PB N="28" REF="001365_0030_0FB295E5BA7A9C90"/>
when they have the <HI>Dimness of the Sha∣dow of Death</HI> upon their Eye-lids. The <HI>Thoughts of a Dying Man,</HI> are usually the Soundest and the Truest Thoughts. We are so advised; Deut. 32.29 <HI>Oh! That they were Wise, that they would Consider their Latter End.</HI> There is the Best <HI>Wisdom, with such as are so well Advised,</HI> as to <HI>Consider,</HI> what <HI>Reflections,</HI> will be Grievous, Irksome, Full of Regret unto us, in our <HI>Latter End;</HI> and <HI>Now,</HI> shun all that will <HI>then</HI> cause <HI>Reflections: Consider,</HI> what <HI>Re∣flections</HI> will at our <HI>Latter End,</HI> fill us with <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory;</HI> and <HI>Now</HI> do those things, which will <HI>then</HI> yield those <HI>Reflections.</HI></P>
<P>My Friend; Suppose thy self in thy Last Agonies; thy Breath failing, thy Throat ratling, thy Eyes giving a ghastly Look, thy Hands clammy, and pulling; and thy <HI>Soul,</HI> thy <HI>Soul,</HI> taking wing for the Eternal World; <HI>Consider,</HI> <Q><HI>O my Soul,</HI> What would I wish to have done, or to have left undone, at this <HI>Decretory Hour!</HI></Q> Oh! Regulate thy Life accordingly.</P>
<P>Do so particularly, in laying aside <HI>Con∣tentions</HI> and <HI>Animosities.</HI> Men at the Point of <HI>Death,</HI> are for <HI>Burying</HI> all Personal

Controversies; they are for a <HI>Reconci∣liation</HI> with their Personal Adversaries. Why should they <HI>Live</HI> so as they would be Lothe to <HI>Die?</HI> Sirs, The <HI>Sun</HI> must not <HI>go down upon your Wrath;</HI> It will be <HI>Sun∣sett</HI> presently!</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Must we Die?</HI> Then our <HI>Friends</HI> must also <HI>Die.</HI> We must not wonder at it. It is what must befal every one of us all. <HI>Ambrose</HI> was in the right of it, when he said unto Mourners, <HI>Quid ab∣surdius, quam ut id quod scias omnibus esse prescriptum, quasi speciale deplores?</HI> We are by a Greater Authority so call'd upon; 1. Cor. 7.30. <HI>This I say, Brethren, The Time is short.

Let all <HI>Friends</HI> look for a <HI>Parting Time.</HI> Live together, as they that must not <HI>Alwayes</HI> Live together. We see People every where <HI>Mourning</HI> over their <HI>departed Friends.</HI> We must look for such things.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="001365_0032_0FB295E874C81D90"/>Must we so? Then let us Discharge our <HI>Duty</HI> to our <HI>Friends,</HI> before it comes to this. Let us do them all the Good that ever we can, while we have, an <HI>Op∣portunity</HI> to Do them Good. Let our Carriage to our Friends, be such, that if they <HI>Dye</HI> before us, we may be able with inexpressible Consolation, to look back upon our <HI>Faithfulness.</HI></P>
<P>Let <HI>Me</HI> therefore deal <HI>Faithfully</HI> in this very Thing, with <HI>You,</HI> my Friends. I must <HI>Faithfully</HI> tell you; If a <HI>Soul Related</HI> unto you be snatch'd out of this world by <HI>Death,</HI> and you must own, you never did any thing for the Salvation of that Soul, Suppose it one of your <HI>Children,</HI> or one of your <HI>Servants,</HI> or a Relative nearer than either of them: Oh! the astonishing Anguish, which your Souls, must on such a deplorable Occasion be fill'd withal! Sirs; <HI>We are to Dye.</HI> We should first make Ready for our own <HI>Death;</HI> and then for the <HI>Death</HI> of our FRIENDS. We don't know, which may get the start in the <HI>Race</HI> to the Goal of <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Must we Dye?</HI> Yet let us Rejoyce in a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> that will one Day save us

from <HI>Death</HI> Dying Saint; Let that be thy <HI>dying Song;</HI> Job 19.25. <HI>I know that my Redeemer Lives; and that He shall stand at the Latter day over the Earth;</HI> And He shall Raise me out of the Earth. O Joy∣ful Tidings! The <HI>Resurrection</HI> was of old called, <HI>The Consolation.</HI> Tho' the Pagans were <HI>Strangers</HI> to the Mystery, and <HI>Scos∣sers</HI> at it, [Witness <HI>Plinies</HI> flouts, <HI>Quae malum, ista dementia est, itorari Vitam Morte!</HI>] Yet, The Children of God, even in the <HI>Secular Times</HI> [Called so, Rom. 16.25. because measured by <HI>Jubilees:</HI>] of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> believed a <HI>Resur∣rection.</HI> God promised them a share in the Blessings of, <HI>The Kingdom of the Mes∣siah.</HI> They <HI>Died,</HI> before these <HI>Promises</HI> were accomplished. Hence they inferred, That they must be <HI>Raised from death,</HI> to Enjoy these <HI>Promises.</HI> It was a Right Inference! Their <HI>Faith</HI> was <HI>God will Re∣deem my Soul from the Power of the Grave.</HI> But then, the <HI>Gospel</HI> of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> has more Conspiciously, more Abundantly, <HI>brought Life and Immortality to Light;</HI> a <HI>Resurrection,</HI> that is, to a <HI>Life of Immor∣tality.</HI> For now we have seen our Lord JESUS CHRIST Himself <HI>Risen</HI> to such a
<PB N="32" REF="001365_0034_0FB295EEA8E12238"/>
<HI>Life;</HI> and so <HI>Risen,</HI> as to leave no Room for doubt, that He will also <HI>Raise</HI> His Fol∣lowers, to such a <HI>Life.</HI> He has told us, [For so it should be rendred:] <HI>He that Believeth on me, shall not die for ever:</HI> Tho' he <HI>Dye,</HI> he shall not <HI>lie dead for ever.</HI> And we have, in His <HI>Resurrection,</HI> an Irrefra∣gable Proof, That He has not therein Deceived us. This, This then shall be the Triumph of our Souls: <Q>LORD, When wilt Thou come, and make the <HI>Graves</HI> yield up their <HI>Dead,</HI> and deliver the <HI>Law∣ful Captive,</HI> and the <HI>Prey of the Terrible! Rejoyce not</HI> against us, O our <HI>Enemy, <HI>Death;</HI></HI> For, <HI>tho' we Fall, we shall Rise again;</HI> when we <HI>sit in Darkness,</HI> the Lord shall be a <HI>Light unto us!</HI></Q> Wherefore, <HI>Comfort one another with these Words.</HI> A∣mong the Primitive Christians, they would often have the Pourtraicts of <HI>Enoch,</HI> of <HI>La∣zarus,</HI> of <HI>Jonas,</HI> and of <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Vision, on their Caemeterial Cells, to Proclaim their <HI>Comfortable Faith</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> to sweeten their Habitation in the <HI>Dry Pit</HI> in the Land where the Sun shines not. But on the Sepulchral Monuments, it was usual for others of them to inscribe the <HI>First Letters</HI> in the Name of our Saviour.
<PB N="33" REF="001365_0035_0FB295F3605465D0"/>
I ask not for those Actions, but for our Following of the <HI>Faith</HI> which produced them!</P>
<P>¶ Finally; <HI>Must we all Die?</HI> Then Persons in a <HI>Publick Station</HI> are to <HI>Dye;</HI> Their <HI>Publick Station</HI> will not Secure them. Even those <HI>Men,</HI> who because of their <HI>Vicegerency</HI> are called, <HI>Gods,</HI> yet have this Praemonition from Him, that is Infinitely Higher than the Highest of them all; <HI>You shall Dye like Men.</HI> Hence the Indian Kings of <HI>Mexico,</HI> would have their Coronation-Robes Painted with <HI>Skulls</HI> and <HI>Bones</HI> of <HI>Dead Men,</HI> to mind them of their <HI>Mortality,</HI> with their <HI>So∣vereignty.</HI></P>
<P>Give me leave, to do at least the part of a <HI>Deaths-Head</HI> among you!</P>
<P>OFFICERS of all sorts; <HI>You are to Dye.</HI> But then certainly your Behaviour in your several <HI>Offices</HI> ought to be such, that you may give up a <HI>Good Account,</HI> unto GOD <HI>the Judge of All.</HI> It was a Voice that once came from the <HI>Imperial Purple;</HI> the Speech of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Son of <HI>Mammaea; That he had an Hand al∣wayes

<P>MINISTERS, They are to <HI>Dye.</HI> Then, My Fathers and Brethren, You should not be <HI>Men of this World.</HI> You must <HI>Live</HI> like men on the Edge of the <HI>Eternal World.</HI> It was a stroke in the <HI>Charge</HI> given to <HI>Ministers</HI> at their <HI>Or∣dination</HI> of old; <HI>Habeatis Eternitatem in omnibus Cogitationibus vestris.</HI> How Pain∣ful, how Watchful, how Faithful ought you to be, in the Discharge of your <HI>Ministry!</HI> In what a continual<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Flame, to Do Good, and Serve Christ, and <HI>Win Souls?</HI> That no part of your <HI>Work</HI> be found <HI>Undone,</HI> when your <HI>Working Time</HI> is done! Excellent the Pattern for us, in One of the Ancients, who could say, <HI>Wherever I come, and whatever I do, methinks, I hear the Trumpet of the Arch-angel, <HI>Arise ye Dead, and come to Iudgment!</HI></HI></P>
<P>MAGISTRATES, They are to <HI>Dye.</HI> Then, with what <HI>Fidelity,</HI> with what <HI>In∣tegrity</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="001365_0037_0FB295F6548BA8A8"/>
should they acquit themselves! With what Concern for the <HI>Welfare of the People,</HI> to whom they are <HI>Shields,</HI> by the <HI>Oath</HI> of God upon them! That when they <HI>Dye,</HI> it may be Testified for them, <HI>They did Good in Israel;</HI> and had the <HI>Seven</HI> things, which <HI>Maimonides</HI> tells us, the Jews required of every one that sat in a Court of Judicature; <HI>Wisdom, Humility, The Fear of God, Contempt of Riches, The Love of Truth, A Good Fame,</HI> and, <HI>To be Beloved of Others. Magistrates</HI> must not be Insen∣sible, that they are to appear before <HI>the Judgment-seat of GOD. Nuper eram In∣dex; Jam Judicor.</HI> —</P>
<P>GOVERNOURS must also <HI>Dye; Em∣perors</HI> are <HI>Dead.</HI> What Obligations does their <HI>Mortality</HI> lay upon them? Even a∣mong the <HI>Pagans,</HI> there were GOVER∣NOURS, that were Charming Exemples of <HI>Truth,</HI> of <HI>Justice,</HI> of <HI>Goodness,</HI> and of a Zeal for the Publick. Of such a Conduct, that like <HI>Nerva,</HI> they could Profess, <HI>Were I to return to a Private Life, I have never done any One thing, that should make me Afraid of any One Man in the World.</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="001365_0038_0FB295F792293F08"/>
Strangely <HI>Beloved</HI> among the People; sty∣led, like <HI>Titus, The Darlings of Mankind.</HI> The People have been ready to Adore them, as they did the <HI>Antonines,</HI> and stigmatize the Houses that had not their <HI>Statues</HI> or <HI>Pictures</HI> in them. Cer∣tainly, among us <HI>Christians,</HI> there should be a <HI>Greater Excellency;</HI> I say, A <HI>Greater Ex∣cellency.</HI> So saith our Saviour, <HI>What do you more than Others?</HI></P>
<P>A GOVERNOUR greatly and justly Beloved among his People, <HI>[Tis no Flat∣tery to Affirm, what Envy it self can't De∣ny!]</HI> was Lately seen at the Head of One of our Colonies. He is this Day to be Interr'd among us; tis with wondrous Lamentations; with such as I may describe in the words of <HI>Suetonius</HI> upon the Death of the Illustrious <HI>Roman;</HI> They are, <HI>Non secus atque in domestico Luctu Maerentibus publice Cunctis;</HI> Or, such as men have at the Loss of their own most Intimate Rela∣tions.</P>
<P>The GENTLEMAN, by whose <HI>Death</HI> One of our Colonies, as Beheaded, lies a Bleeding, and One who in the Confession
<PB N="37" REF="001365_0039_0FB295F9043E3268"/>
of all men, had the, <HI>True spirit of a Gentleman,</HI> will alwayes be Remembred with Esteem among his People. I Con∣fess, we are sometimes affronted with <HI>False Praises</HI> in <HI>Funeral Sermons;</HI> which deserve as much to be derided, as those Passages of <HI>Nero</HI>'s Oration were by the Senate, wherein he Cried up the <HI>Discretion</HI> of <HI>Claudius.</HI> I shall not be guilty of them, when I say of this our WINTHROP; He will be ever Mentioned, as he was highly Esteemed, very Particularly, for his Courteous way of Treating all men, but especially <HI>Good</HI> Men, and <HI>Old</HI> Men, on all occasions; and for his <HI>Paternal,</HI> and <HI>Patient,</HI> and <HI>Generous</HI> Administration of the Publick Affairs.</P>
<P>His Excellent FATHER, One of the Best of Men, [Of whom we may also say, what has been said of another, <HI>He was Son to an Excellent Father, and Father to an Ex∣cellent Son:</HI>] HE laid that Charge upon him; <HI>That if ever he had an Opportunity, to do any Service for his People, he should be sure to do it, with all the Alacrity imaginable.</HI> He would speak of this Charge, and of the Vast Impression it made upon him. He perform'd it, He fulfill'd it. Our

<HI>Enosh,</HI> never <HI>Forgat</HI> it. He went over the <HI>Atlantic</HI> on purpose to procure a <HI>Con∣firmation</HI> of their Invaded Liberties. GOD Prospered him: Returned him. He flew back with an <HI>Olive-branch</HI> which prov'd a <HI>Garland</HI> unto him: The Obliged People (instead of an <HI>Obsidional Crown</HI> for him) Chose him for their GOVERNOUR. They said unto him, as the <HI>General As∣sembly</HI> of old said unto <HI>Gideon, Rule thou over us, for thou hast Delivered us.</HI> They found him a GOVERNOUR, that fully answered their Expectation. I am sure, I shall not fall under the Character, of a <HI>Simeon Metaphrastes,</HI> for bearing such a Testimony.</P>
<P>And where, O Bereaved Colony, where will you now find a <HI>Strong Rod,</HI> by which your Government may be Carried on? The Circumstances of the Day require an <HI>Extraordinary Man;</HI> A <HI>Man,</HI> which none but a Glorious CHRIST can make for you. Certainly, You will Present your most ardent Supplications unto Him for such a <HI>Man.</HI> Your Brethren here, that <HI>Love</HI> you, will also <HI>Pray</HI> for you. We will Pray for you, That there may be a Perpetual Reign of all <HI>Godliness</HI> and <HI>Ho∣nesty</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="001365_0041_0FB295FBF4F2BBB8"/>
among you, and Every thing that a People favoured <HI>Above all the Families of the Earth</HI> should have shining among them. We will Pray for you, That you may be a People, who for <HI>Ʋnity</HI> as well as <HI>Equity,</HI> and for <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> unto <HI>Good Rulers,</HI> and <HI>Thankfulness</HI> &amp; <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> under your Evangelical Priviledges, may Adorn your Profession wonderfully.</P>
<P>When you Lost the GOVERNOUR, who was the <HI>Father</HI> of him that is now ta∣ken from you, I heard <HI>Funeral Sermons,</HI> Preached on those Words; 2 Chron. 34.28. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shalt be Gathered unto thy Grave in Peace, neither shall thine Eyes see all the Evil, that I will bring upon this Place.</HI> We will <HI>Pray,</HI> we will <HI>Pray,</HI> That Unknown <HI>Evil</HI> may not now, be coming upon you</P>
<P>I will Conclude with a Good Advice to us all, which I have somewhere met withal.</P>
<P><Q>Since we have <HI>Lived</HI> here, and since we are to <HI>Die,</HI> and yet we <HI>Live</HI> after <HI>Death,</HI> and others will succed us, when we are <HI>Dead,</HI> we are greatly Concerned, To send <HI>Before us</HI> a very Good TREASURE; To carry <HI>With us</HI> a very Good CONSCI∣ENCE; And to leave <HI>Behind us</HI> a very Good EXAMPLE.</Q></P>
