<P>"Gentlemen, I told you at first, I would make no ap∣peal to your passions, nor shall I; I have told you the sto∣ry as it was told to me; I shall call the witnesses, and if they do prove the case to your satisfaction, you will, I doubt not, find the prisoners guilty.

<P>A gentleman came, which I since find to be Lord Baltimore, he came to the shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was his business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He came behind another customer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was that customer known to you;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What passed at that time between you and the gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gentleman forced his discourse very much to the lady, and then asked me what the ruff was that was in the window. I reached it to him, and told him it was eighteen pence; he bought the ruff, and went away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did he come at any time afterwards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He came again two or three days after∣wards; I was not at home; about a week after he came
<PB N="8" REF="010919_0007_0F8529136F8D2820"/>at night; nothing particular passed then, he only bought nine yards of ribbon, and went away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When did you see him again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't exactly tell the time. I believe a∣bout a week after that, as near as I can guess, I saw him again, he came about noon; he came in a great hurry, all over mud on one side, and said a coach had flung him down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said it was very odd he should be so near the coach and not see it. He said it was thinking on me. I gave him no answer, not to my knowledge. He asked me if he might sit down, if he should not hurt the chair. I told him, that he would not hurt the chair. He asked me for some silk mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tins; he said they were for two little misses, and must be about the size of my arm; he said he was a neighbour, and lived just by, in Tower-street, and would bring the ladies some time or other to see me; he then said, he should be glad to accompany me to the play, if I would go. I made answer, I never was at a play, and never intended it. That was all that particu∣larly passed then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What day of the week was this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened after this at any time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw him no more to my knowledge. On Monday, the 14th of December, at night, one Mrs. Har∣vey came; she afterwards told me her name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you see her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; <STAGE>(<HI>pointing to the prisoner Harvey</HI>)</STAGE> she bespoke a pair of laced ruffles, and asked, if I could get them done by the next day noon; after she had be∣spoke them, she asked me, if my name was not Wood∣cock; she said that I had been strongly recommended to her, and she loved to encourage young beginners; and told me if she liked the ruffles, she would recommend me to a lady of her acquaintance which wanted a great many things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any thing else pass that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to my knowledge. The next day a∣bout noon, she came according to her time, and fetched the ruffles, and said she wanted several more things, and asked me, if I could come to her house next day at four o'clock; I answered, I would come if she pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any thing more pass then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing particular. The next day, ac∣cording
<PB N="9" REF="010919_0008_0F85291463C74570"/>to my time, I went, about half an hour after four o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What day of the month?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>December the 16th, the day of the week was Wednesday. I went to Curtain Row, just by Hol∣loway mount. The maid opened the door, she went up stairs and let her mistress know that I was there, and then I was ordered up stairs; she behaved in a very genteel manner, and asked me to sit down, and then desired to look at the things which I had brought; she ordered tea directly; I told her I could not stay to drink tea, and begged to be excused. Just as I was speaking of that, in came a little man like a Jew, and made a great many compliments to this lady, as if he had not seen her before that day. I have since found the name of this man to be Jsaac Jsaacs; then they began to talk about his going to the play, she said she was going into the city to see a lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did she name what part of the city, or what lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he said he must have a coach to go to the play, and chat if she would, she might go part of the way in his coach, that he would set her down. Then the turned to me, and said, this is the lady I told you of; she then said, she would be glad if I would go along with her; that she wanted a great many things, and would be a good customer to me. I made many excuses, that my dress was not suitable, and then desired to be excused from going that night; she said, the lady was a very agreeable lady, and would think nothing of my dress, it was all very well, and begged I would go; then the Jew went with a pretence to fetch a coach; he came back again directly, and hurried away very fast; we were hurried into the coach, and the maid seemingly, was to bring the candle, but kept back with it. I went into the coach in the dark, and was not able to discern what fort of a coach it was. When I got into the coach, the Jew drew up the glasses; I observed that they were very good glasses for a hackney coach. He said it was a very good coach indeed. I by and by said, it was a ve∣ry good coachman, as well as a good coach, he drove so fast, and I did not hear him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the horses. The lady made answer, and said, she supposed that the gen∣tleman had put six pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the coachman's pocket in or∣der to make him make haste, that he might get to the play time enough. In about half an hour we were got to the house; just as we were got to the house, as we
<PB N="10" REF="010919_0009_0F852914A4B5A8C8"/>were coming to the door, Mrs. Harvey said, Miss, this is a very fine house this lady keeps; I said, I was very sorry I was come in such a dress, for I was quite asham∣ed; then they knocked at the door, they drove in so fast, that I did not know that it was in a court-yard, but thought it was a door in the street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it a door in the street?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Then I was desired to walk up stairs; I went up along with Mrs. Harvey; they led me into one room, then a second, and out of that into a third; there was an old man sitting, whom I found since to be Doctor Griffinburg; he got up in a very complaisant manner, and asked me to sit down; Mrs. Harvey asked for the la∣dy; he said he would go and see for her; he went out, and brought in word she would be here presently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who did you see next?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sat about half an hour with Mrs. Har∣vey and Dr. Griffinburgh, and then in came the gentle∣man, whom I since find to be Lord Baltimore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What passed then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was much struck, knowing him to be the man I had seen at my shop before; he came in with a great many compliments, he said, how do you do, Miss, I hope you are well, and such like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How was he drest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a linen night-gown; he pretended he had not been well; as he came in, I understood Dr. Grif∣finburg, he was the steward, Mrs. Harvey said to him something about the lady, I can't tell what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What passed after this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He said to me, I told you I would recom∣mend you to some ladies, that they were great ladies, and would want many things in your way. I did not remember that he had told me that; I made answer, I was much obliged to him, and asked him where the la∣dies were; he said he would go and see for them; he went out, and brought in word that the ladies were not at home, but would be soon; then after we had sit a little while, he said he would go and call the housekeeper; he went out, and brought in a woman, which I find since to be Mrs. Griffinburg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Is she in court?</P>

<P>What passed then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He ordered tea, and asked me to drink tea. I told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I was obliged to him, I had drank tea
<PB N="11" REF="010919_0010_0F8529156365E3C0"/>at Mrs. Harvey's. He said he had not, and therefore de∣sired it might be brought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did they drink tea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>They did, and with a great deal of per∣suasion, I drank one dish. After tea he went out of the room, and brought in a heap of nicknacks; such as pur∣ses, smelling-bottles, tetotums and a ring: He said he had bought them all for me. I told him. I had no use for them, and did not chuse to accept them. He wanted me to play at tetotum: He said, he supposed I could play, and begged I would, I told him, when I was a child pos∣sibly I might, but now I thought it rather beneath me. He said, if I would not accept the things we should play for them; which we did, but I did not accept of them after∣wards. I said several times, between, to Mrs. Harvey, I should be glad if she would let me go home. She said we should go home presently. I told her it grew late, and begged that I might go, for my friends did not know where I was, and would be uneasy. She said I should go presently. The gentleman said he wanted me to see the house. I told him I did not care to stay to∣night; and as the ladies were not there, and I did not see they would come, I could see the house another time. He said, may be I would not come another time, I said, may be I would. He said, will you promise me to come another time. I said I did not chuse to promise it. I would not pro∣mise, because I never intended it, if I could get out; not that that I had, at that time, any thoughts of being kept there; but expecting the person that courted me, I wanted to be at home. He then said, Miss, but you shall see the house to-night, therefore took me in to see another room or two. When we came into a room where there was a harpsicord, he asked Mrs. Griffinburg whether she was sure all the family were out, because if he was sure all the family were out, he would play the music to Miss.—This confirmed me that he was a servant in the house; and because I thought I heard the Doctor before say, here comes the steward; and the gentleman having so mean an appearance, I had no notion he was master of the house.</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as he had said that, Mrs. Griffing∣burg, turned to Mrs. Harvey, and said, how glad she was they had got so nice an opportunity to have the house all to themselves. After he had played the music, and they had staid a little while, I was had out into the room I was first in. I intreated of Mrs. Harvey again
<PB N="12" REF="010919_0011_0F8529161D9D11E8"/>that she would let me go home, for it was late. They said it was not late; it was not above eight or nine o'clock, and the lady would come presently. I told them, as to the lady, I did not see she would come, and I must go home. Lord Baltimore said, Miss, you shall stay to supper first. I said, Sir, I don't choose any supper, and begged I might go home. He then ordered supper. Mrs. Griffinburg went out of the room, and ordered supper. As soon as she was gone, he took me up behind the win∣dow curtain, and said, Miss, you shall come and see where you are: You don't know where you are, do you. I said, no; Sir, where is it; but he did not tell me then; he began to show indecencies, such as opening his breech∣es, and putting his tongue into my mouth. I flew into a very great passion, struggled, and got from behind the curtain. Mrs. Harvey and Doctor Griffinburg came up seemingly to help him: With that I fought with them all, and said, I would go home directly, and made up to the door: With that, he said I should stay to supper first. I said I would not slay, I would go home directly. He then made me sit down by him at supper, but I would no eat nor drink. He then offered me a glass of syllabub, which I knocked out of his hand, and got up again, and said I would go home, and made up to the door. He said it was late, and said there could be no coach got for me. I told him not to tell me about a coach, I wanted no coach, and would slay upon no account whatever. I de∣fired he would not attempt to persuade me. With that he stood over me (I believe it might be then about eleven but can't exactly say the time; I think it was about e∣leven when they had first done supper) he stlood over me till between twelve and one. I told—</P>

<P>Did you cry at that time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What passed after that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seeing the distress I was in, and that I would go home, and I said how frightened my friends would be, he said, he would write a letter to my
<PB N="13" REF="010919_0012_0F852916DC421D98"/>friends, and say that I was in all safety, and well, some∣thing to that purpose. I said if he could fend a letter, what was the reason he could not let me go home? I would go home, and he should not keep me upon any account whatever. With that he said I could not, nor should not go home. I cried very violently, and said it did not signify, they should not keep me there. He flew into a passion, and said I need not trouble myself about him, for he should not meddle with me. I told him no, no more he should. He went away. Then Harvey and Griffinburg, and Dr. Griffinburg, stood over me for a∣bout another hour, to persuade me to be reconciled, and go up flairs to bed. I told them I would go to no bed in that house, nor any where but where I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was my Lord in the room at this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he was gone. At last they said it did not signify, for if I would stay up all night they would not, and I should go up stairs. With that they led me up a pair of back stairs into a room where was a bed. They perswaded me very much to go to bed. I told them I would not go to bed in that house.— They both went to bed some time after in the same room, and I walked about the room all night, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and in the greatest distress poslible. I went osten to the window to see for day-light: And as soon as day-light came. I opened the window, to see if I could jump out: but when I looked, I saw there was no such thing as jumping out and saving life: It was two pair of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I stood at the window till eight in the morning, when I few a young woman coming, which I thought looked like an honest person, and would go and tell my father. With that I throwed down my handkerchief, which was as wet with tears as if dipped in water. She took it up; bat being so high the did not at first see where it came from, and therefore went on her way. I then called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> woman, young woman, twice; with that fine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the handkerchief, and made a motion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it down within the rails.

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Which said that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both of them. I said I did not care a∣ny thing about it; if he would give me his whole estate, and settle it all upon me, I would not stay upon any ac∣count whatever, therefore begged they would not think of keeping me, for I would go home. Sometime after this they went out of the room, and in came Dr Grif∣finburg and Lord Baltimore, which terrified me very much: Indeed I was crying in a violent manner, and said I would go home. My Lord said it was strange I should make such a piece of work, had not he promised me that I snould go home at twelve o'clock. I told him I would go home directly, for my relations would go all about among my other friends, and when they could not find me they would go out of their senses; there∣fore I must go home directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What relations did you allude to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I meant my father and my two sisters. After that I went down stairs, and I cried just as usual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Into what room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot remember the room; he went with me, and I believe he led me down stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened to you then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cried as usual. They brought the break∣sast, but I would not eat nor drink: I went on in the fame manner till twelve o'clock came; then I was quite outrageous. I said it did not signify their pretending to keep me, for I would not stay. He pretended again to write to my father. I told him it did not signify, for nothing he could do should keep me there. With that he assured me that he meant nothing but honour, for he loved me to distraction: That he could not part with me, and I must stay. I told him I would not stay upon any account; he said he would write to my father, and when my father came, he would make such proposals to my father as I thould like; and if I did not like them and like to stay, I should go home with my father: with that he wrote. I do not know what answer I made to him, and I was so much disturbed, I can't recollect what he wrote.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he read it you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did. He then put the pen in my hand, and told me I must write, dear father, this is true. And should be glad if you will come directly this afternoon. from your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> daughter, &amp;c.</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes word for word as he dictated, and stood over me to see me do it. I did it to see my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How came you to put such a subscription as that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wrote it with this view, that my father might come directly; but, if it had been otherwise, I must have wrote it because he stood over me. He put the pen into my hand, and said I must write it, that was enough for me when I was in his power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was that the reason of your writing it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It was, and that my father might come directly.</P>
<STAGE>The Letter read.</STAGE>
<P><Q>YOUR daughter Sally sends you the inclosed, and desires you will not be uneasy on her account, because every thing will turn out well, with a little patience and prudence. She is at a friend's house, safe and well, in all honesty and honour; nothing else is meant, you may depend on it: and, Sir, as your presence and consent is necessary, we beg of you to come in a private manner to Mr. Richard Smith's, in Broad street New Buildings.</Q></P>

<P>What time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't justly say; I believe it was about noon. When he had wrote, I observed there was no di∣rection where my father should come; with that I told him I was very sure he did not intend to send it, that he had put no directions upon the letter. I asked him, where it was? He said, it was New Broad street Build∣ings. I asked him, what his name was? he said, it was Richard Smith. I asked him, if he could look firmly at me, and say, with truth, that his name was Richard Smith, and that that was New Broad-street Buildings? I put it home to him several times; at last he own∣ed his name was not Richard Smith, but that Rich∣ard Smith, lived two or three doors off, and that that was New Broad-street Buildings. I then asked him, what end of the town? he said St. James's. I did not know, whether the letter was sent or no, till afterwards.</P>

<P>What passed that day afterwards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went on crying in the same manner, and pleading that they would let me go home. I often
<PB N="16" REF="010919_0015_0F852919C6D9C0F0"/>went to the window to shew my distress; which, when they saw, one or other of these women always pulled me away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Which did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both of them, as they happened to be in the way. I was present at dinner, but neither eat nor drank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who dined?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Dr. Griffinburg, Mrs. Harvey, and, I believe Mrs. Griffinburg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you see any more servants during that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or any other part of the family, besides Dr. Griffinburg, Mrs. Harvey, and Mrs. Griffinburg?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I went on in the same manner all the day, crying, and taking on, and begg'd I might go home; and they pretended that my father was coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>was any thing said to you about your going so often to the window?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing particularly but they pulling me away, and said I should not stand there. In the even∣ing, on Thursday, Mrs. Griffinburg, or somebody, had ordered the windows in the room where I had been be∣fore, in the night, to be nailed up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know who gave that order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know who ordered them, of my own knowledge. With that Lord Baltimore came in, and pretended to be in a great passion, with Mrs. Grif∣finburg, and said, what did she mean by ordering the windows to be nailed up, to make his servants think he was going to murder somebody, or do something bad in∣deed, that the windows must be nailed up. He turned to me, and said, madam, I assure you if you offer to o∣pen a window, or make any disturbance any other way, I will f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing you out of the window, or do for you. I as∣sure you; which frightened me very much; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that may-be he might murder me. This was before supper. I went on in the same manner, pleading and crying; I don't know that I stopt crying all that day. They supped together, but there was no servants: I neither eat nor drank. After supper, when time was come to go up stairs, I said, I would not go up till he had promised that he would not meddle with me, nor come near me. He promised he would not, and went
<PB N="17" REF="010919_0016_0F852919DF3F6F78"/>away. Some time after that, I was led again up the same back stairs, into the same back room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who led you up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Harvey, or Mrs. Griffinburgh, I don't know which; I believe both of them. They in∣treated me very much to go to bed; I told them I would go to no bed in that house; I would neither eat nor drink, if they kept me there ever so long; they went to bed, and left me. I walked about the room in the same manner all night, in the greatest distress possible, and in the morning waked them with my crying. They then asked me how I could make such a piece of work; they never heard a person make such a crying, or saw such distress in their lives. With that I told them, I thought I had great reason for it, when I was taken a∣way from all that was near and dear to me in the world. I did assure them, that I would not stay there, and they should not keep me upon any account; for that I would never yield to his base purposes. With that, Mrs. Har∣vey said, she did not suppose he wanted to do any thing against my will. I told her, if he did not, what was the reason that he kept me there from day to day, and would not let me go home? I told her I would not stay, or yield to his base purposes, if he would give me his house full of silver and gold—This was up in the room, if I remember right. She said, she did not suppose he would do any thing against my will, or keep me against my will. I told her, he never would keep me with my will, for it never would be my will to stay there; and that if he would marry me, and settle all his estate upon me, I never would have him, for I hated him, and ever should; and therefore begged he would not keep me in that prison of hell, for it was a prison of hell indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who was in the room at this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only Mrs. Harvey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened after this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some time after this, I went down stairs again into the same room where I was before. He came to me; I was in the very same distress as I was before; it was before breakfast; and I told him, though he had no compassion on me—I asked him if he had ever been a father; if he had, he might have some compassion for my father: if he was a father himself, surely he must consider my father, what he must feel for the loss of a child that he loved, and could not tell where she was; whether she was dead or alive. I told him, not only so,
<PB N="18" REF="010919_0017_0F85291A95C41908"/>but that we were engaged in business, and they could not carry on the business without me. With that, he said, he had been more careful in that respect than I had, for he had sent my father something, that his business might not stop. I told him, that would be of no use, for they could make no use of it till I came. He said with that, I should write to my father myself. I told him, if I did, it would be to no purpose, for I supposed I must write just what he pleased; and if he did not like it, he would not send it, let me write whatever I would. He said, yes he would, and I should write. I said, I supposed he would stand over me all the time. He said, no, he would go away; but he left the two women standing over me; therefore he might as well have stay'd himself.</P>

<P>Explain the meaning of what you call <HI>stand∣ing over you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Standing close to me, to see how I acted, and take care of me; this was upon Friday, about the middle of the day. I wrote three or four lines, and said, more than truth, because I knew it would come into his hands; and if it did not please him, I knew that he would not let it go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you tell what you wrote?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said that he had used me with as much honour as I could expect, and begged they would come immediately. After I had wrote these two or three lines, the two women said, he had sent my father two hun∣dred pounds the day before, and that I ought to put it in, and know if they had it: that they should return thanks for it. I told them I would not do any such thing, for I can'd nothing about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both jointly, and I refused it several times. After that they went and asked Lord Baltimore, whether it should be to or not; he came in and said he did not care much about it, but I might, if I would, put it in; so I wrote that they told me they had sent two hundred pounds, and I desired to know if he had it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think your expression was, that you put into your letter more than truth; how came you to do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the reason I said before; that I knew he would not send it, if I did not say something in fa∣vour of him. In an hour or two after that, there came up one of the servants, I forget which, and said that a
<PB N="19" REF="010919_0018_0F85291CD744DD08"/>gentleman had brought a letter, which Lord Baltimore brought in, and said it came from Richard Smith; and that my father had been there, and would not stay till I and he could be sent for. With that I said, I would not believe any thing of it. I did believe it was his own forging, for it was wrote in another language. He pre∣tended to read it to me, but I told h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was nothing at all, for he could read it as he lik'd. With that he said he would send for the man, and make me a liar. I said he could not, but he would make the man say as he pleased, and could talk to him in another language. The man was brought. I told him if he would let me ask the man questions, then I would believe, if he gave me satisfactory answers. He said I could confound the whole world; I told him I did not know but I might, if they did not speak truth. The man came in and sat down, and he spoke to him something first in another language; it was not English I know; and then said, did not you bring this letter? he answered, Yes. I told him I did not believe he did; the more, because he had been talking to him in another language. I asked him what sort of a man it was came to him. He said a mid∣dling man. I asked him what he called a middling man; he said a talish man. I asked whether he was old or young, and what sort of a face he had, but he could give me no satisfactory answer to any thing I said. I then said to Lord Baltimore, who is a liar now, you or me? I said they were a parcel of popish, rubbishing peo∣ple, and I would not believe any thing they said to me, (for I thought Lord Baltimore had been a French man and a Papist.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you give any reason?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought him a Frenchman, and there∣fore supposed him to be a Papist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he speak broken English?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I thought so; but that might be my ig∣norance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What time was this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>About dinner time. They went into a∣nother room; there was music and dancing by Mrs. Har∣vey and this Smith.</P>

<P>Did the person that spake this foreign lan∣guage to my Lord, pass for Smith, or one of my Lord's servants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He passed for Richard Smith. My Lord Baltimore played upon the musick, Richard Smith and
<PB N="20" REF="010919_0019_0F85291D96A1B768"/>Mrs. Harvey danced, and I walked about the room in the greatest distress. After that they took me to look at the pictures; and there was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip in distress. I told them that was my picture. They said no, and took me to another picture of a ship in a storm, and told me that was my picture. Then they led me back into the room again. They all sat down before the sire, and I sat down with them. He said to this Richard Smith, as soon as he had sat down, he should draw Miss's picture. I said he should do no such thing; I should not think of having my picture drawn. He drew my picture in the posture I sat crying, in this manner <STAGE>(<HI>describing it, with her head leaning upon her hand;</HI>)</STAGE> they did not put the tears into the picture.</P>

<P>What passed that night?</P>

<SP>

<P>Nothing more particular. About twelve at night it was pretended that the little Jew man that first took me away, was sent with that letter that I wrote. Broughton came in, who was called the stewart, (that is one that answered to that name) and brought word that my father had stopt the Jew. Lord Baltimore was in a violent passion, and swore he would go and pull my fa∣ther by the nose. I desired he would give me leave to speak a word or two: that I was very sure my father had done no such thing, for he had not spirit enough for it. While I was speaking, in came the other man, the Jew that I had seen at first, Isaacs; he brought a let∣ter, which he said he had brought from my friends; and told me they were all well satisfied and pleased, and so put the letter into my hands. It was wrote by my sis∣ter, and my sister writing so seldom, I did not know her hand at first; but turning the other side of the letter, I found the seal to be the young man's that courted me, Mr. Davis, which cousirmed me it was come from them, which was the first word I knew that came from them.</P>

<P>The purport of the letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was, as near as I can remember, this: Only please to appoint a place when and where we may meet you. It was directed to me if I remember right. This was about twelve at night: time was come that I must go up stairs, which I would not do till he had pro∣mised me he would not meddle with me, nor come near me. I went up stairs to the same room where I went before, and Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg came up to the same room, and pressed me very much to go to bed. I still cried, and said I would not; but finding
<PB N="21" REF="010919_0020_0F85291E570478A8"/>my strength was gone, I said, may be I will lie down sometime in the night in my cloaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had you eat any thing at that time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my knowledge I had neither eat no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drank. Upon my saying that, Mrs. Griffinburg went out of the room, and left only me and Mrs. Harvey. I fancy that was between one and two, but I cannot say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you lie down in the middle of the night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I lay down in about half an hour after Mrs. Griffinburg was gone; and she coming up about half an hour after frightened me, for I thought it was Lord Baltimore coming up, which set me in such a tremble, that I was obliged to get up; then I walked a∣bout, and so laid down again, and so I went on all the night in great distress: then I talked to Mrs. Harvey, and asked her if she had ever been in love: I think she said yes, I am not positive: with that I told her, then I was engaged; that a young man kept me company, and we were about settling; that he had a great regard for me, and that I could not say but I had the same for him, and therefore begged her to think how hard it must be in my case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That part of the story was true, was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. I told her how I had been brought up from a child in a very religious way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That part of the story is true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and that I could not bear any of their ways; and that if Lord Baltimore would settle all his estate on me I would not comply, and a great deal of such discourse, which I can't now recollect; but begged that she would lay it before my Lord, and intreat him to let me go; for I thought, if she would lay the case before him, and tell him how it was, he would let me go. I said, I dare say, if she had a mind, she could let me go herself. She said, no; tho' she had known the house so long, she did not know the way out of the house. With my crying, and being in such an agony and di∣stress, she got up sooner than common, and we went down stairs; but when we came to the bottom of the stairs every door was locked, and we could get no fur∣ther; we were therefore forced to go up stairs, and were upwards of an hour before we could get into the room, where there was a sire below stairs, where we were before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did Mrs. Harvey try to get out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcoock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did, but could not. She did not try
<PB N="22" REF="010919_0021_0F85291F16FDECE0"/>to get out of the house, but only into the room where the fire was down stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was done in consequence of this desire of your's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we came down stairs she did go out from me, but Mrs. Griffinburg was present: they did not leave me alone not one five minutes together, I be∣lieve. Lord Baltimore came in soon after. I was in great distress, as usual. They had some breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg. Lord Baltimore was present, if I remember right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did he say any thing to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did, but I cannot exactly remember what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>What time did Lord Baltimore come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think about eight or nine o'clock. I pleaded the same arguments with him as I had done with Harvey, and told him about this same young man. With that he flew into a violent passion, and called me all the hitches and whores he could think of, and throwed the news-paper at me; and told me, if I offered to tell him any thing more about another man, he would fling me out of the window, or tie my petticoats about my head, and send me home in a wheelbarrow. The little Jew was present, Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg, and he said to the Jew, carry the slut to a mean house, like her∣self. With that I was terrified very much, and thought he meant a bawdy-house. He flew out of the room in a great pastion, and left the little Jew, Harvey and Grif∣finburg. They persuaded me to be reconciled. They said, had he not promised he would send for my father, and make such proposals as he would like; and if I did not like them, I should go home again, and had I not better leave it to him. With that the little Jew came and told me, that all my friends, and Mr. Davis in par∣ticular, were well pleased. I told him I was sure it was a very great story, therefore begged he would not say a∣nother word about it; but with their persuasions, and fearing he would send me to a bawdy-house, I desired Lord Baltimore might be called in. He came in. I told him, if my father came, and terms were offered him, I would consider them, and begged that God would direct me. This was on Saturday about noon: after this I was very ill, and could hold up my head no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had you eat or drank then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="010919_0022_0F8529213264B608"/>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; only a dish of tea that morning. With that he came to me, and told me, by that means I put it out of my power to help myself in that which I was so afraid of; and then he went and mixed a draught and brought it me, and said, I must take it. I refused it, searing there might be something hurtful in it. He said there was nothing hurtful in it, and I must take it. I did. This was about two or three o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the draught?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Physical, I believe. I took it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>did any thing happen at dinner that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing particular. I lay in that man∣ner, with my head upon the elbow chair, till nine o'clock. Nothing particular passed that evening. At the usual time he said we must go to bed again: I got a little more spirits, but I said I would not go till he had promised not to come near nor meddle with me: he said he would lead me up stairs, which he did: when he had got there, he desired me much to go to bed, and order∣ed Mrs. Griffinburg, before I went up, to make me some whey: I believe between two and three o'clock, as well as I can recollect, she brought me some red wine, and I drank a little of it, and eat a bit of a toast: this was in the morning: I had not laid down then: this was between two and three o'clock on Sunday morning: I had laid down in my cloaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you take any whey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I did not: the wine was brought in∣stead of the whey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who was in the room besides?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only the two women and myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who lay in the room that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Harvey. I laid down sometimes, and sometimes walked about, but was very terrified least he should come to me. Mrs. Harvey said, surely I must think the man had a great love for me to come from his bed to me. I said, no, it was not love, it was lust. I pleaded many things as usual with her, but nothing had any influence upon her: we came down stairs again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who did you see?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was Sunday morning about nine or ten o'clock. Lord Baltimore came in to me, and asked me how I did, (this was after I had breakfasted) and asked me if he had not kept his promise. He asked me if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad any whey. I told him no, I had a little red wine. He was very angry with the housekeeper, and said that I
<PB N="24" REF="010919_0023_0F852921DF4E01F0"/>must take another draught, for it was enough to kill me. With that he mixed up another draught, and insisted u∣pon it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I should take it, which I refused, fearing there should be something hurtful; but I did take it. He went out and left me till the afternoon; Mrs. Har∣vey continued with me,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any conversation pass between you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>As usual I was crying in the same man∣ner. In the afternoon he came in to me, and desired I would compose myself, and sit down and talk to him a little. With that he began to ridicule religion, and to say that all things came by nature; and that man, when be died, went to the dust: that he thought they had no living souls: and he said that, as a philosopher, he believ∣ed there was neither God nor devil, heaven nor hell. I desired they would bring me a bible, and I would prove to him that there was all. With that the bible was brought, and I proved to him from the word as much as was in my power, that there was a God, a devil, heaven and hell: and after that I concluded my discourse, which was from two or three in the afternoon till nine at night, with very little intermission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What time did the family dine that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>About four o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you dine with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe that day I might eat a bit; I am not sure. I told him my reason of having so long a dis∣course, and being so plain with him, was to convince him of the difference there was between him and me; and that he might be assured it was impossible I should comply, and that I would not stay upon any account whatever, and therefore begged he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me go home. After supper they all went out of the room; that is, Dr. Griffinburg, Mrs. Harvey, and Mrs. Griffin∣burg, went out, and left him and me alone. Then he began to show indecencies: he first pulled me into his lap. This was about nine o'clock on Sunday night, and wanted to put his hand in my bosom, which I would not let him, and got out of his arms. Then I was set down in the other chair, he began to open his breeches again, and strove to pull my hand to him. I struggled and got away, and got up; then he pressed me to one corner of the room, and there pressed me up against the wainscot, as if he would press me to death. I struggled and got from him; then he got me down in an elbow chair; he opened his breeches, and strove to pull my petticoats up.
<PB N="25" REF="010919_0024_0F85292263C856E0"/>I struggled, and cried out all I could, and begged and pleaded with him that he would take my life, for I would never yield the other to any one, but upon ho∣nourable terms, which was marriage. He then got up and walked about the room awhile, and then set me down, and served me in the same manner, but did not compleat his base purpose at that time. This, I believe was near two hours. I struggled and cried all I could. Then he called in Mrs. Harvey, and said we must go up to bed; and he said he would lead me up stairs, which terrified me greatly. I did not know what I should do with myself, least he should fling me upon the bed when he got me up stairs. Mrs. Harvey made an ex∣cuse: she said she had forgot something, and must go down again. I was afraid they had juggled it between them, and begged and pleaded he would not meddle with me. He began as before to open his breeches, and strove to pull up my petticoats. Soon after Mrs. Harvey came into the room again, and he told me, if I did not undress myself that night, and go into bed, he would force me to go into bed with him. He went away; and I went to bed with Mrs. Harvey. This was on Sunday night. All this night I had no rest: I did not go to sleep any part of the night, as I know of. I started up and cryed, O, he is coming! he is coming! with that I again pleaded with Mrs. Harvey, to persuade him to let me go home. I met with no success, as she was just as relentless as ever. This was on Monday morning. When I came down stairs I was in the same manner. I went on crying as usual, praying that I might go home, or see my friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you take upon you to say you was crying all this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ceased very little indeed, by and by he came to me and said, if I would go and have my face washed, and another cap on, and clean things, and leave crying, I should see my father; but if I would not I should never see him; for what could my father think to see me in that dirty condition, and my eyes so bad with crying. I had had no change of linen. I went up stairs with that view. He said, if I would go up he would send for my father, and I should see him. He then said, now you shall see your father to day. I had put on some linen, with my own gown and petticoats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who furnished you with the linen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Griffinburg brought it. Then he
<PB N="26" REF="010919_0025_0F852922DBBEE7C0"/>said I should see my father, I should go and take an air∣ing in the coach, and that would divert me a little. I told him that would be no pleasure to me. If he would carry me to see my father, that would be a pleasure to me. With that he said I should go and take an airing, and see my father when I came back. Soon after this they brought word the coach was ready, and that I mast go. He led me down stairs, into the coach. It was in the yard at the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was the gate shut?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know. He handed me into the coach himself. He then got in: Mrs. Harvey and he sat on one side, and Dr. Griffinburgh and his wife sat on the other side. He bade Mrs. Harvey sit forward, against the door. I sat between my Lord and Mrs. Harvey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had any body hold of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know exactly. They drove out of the gate with such violence, that they tore off part of the gate by that means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps this occasioned the coach to stop?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It did not cause the least stoppage. They went through the streets over Westminster-bridge. They had like to have been overturned, they went with such violence. They had like to have been overturned within three or four doors of the house. As near as I can recollect, this was about two o'clock. When we came to Westminster-bridge, or before, I can't justly say, I said, I hoped he was not going to carry me far, that he was not going abroad. He said no, he was only taking an airing to divert me, and that he should come back again to dinner. When we came some way farther, and I saw the four and five mile stones, I said I hoped he was not going to carry me abroad. He said, yes, to be sure, he was going to carry me to Spain, to see the Spaniards. We put on. I asked him again, and he said the same. When we got to Epsom, he said, now we are come to Spain, and these are the Spaniards. There were two or three men in the streets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How came you to know it was Epsom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw the post to direct to Epsom. When they came to Epsom they began to talk about the coun∣try house. Then I began to think we were going there. When we came to the house they asked me how I liked it. I told them that was a worse prison than the other,
<PB N="27" REF="010919_0026_0F852923B6C7FCA0"/>and hoped they were not come to stay there, for I could not bear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who asked you how you liked it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say; it was when we got out of the coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who handed you out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't recollect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you go into the house immediately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What passed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>They went to dinner soon after we were in. It was about four o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At that time did the same people appear to you, or other people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the country there were two men ser∣vants waited at table. I did eat a very little bit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any thing pass at dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, that I can recollect, particu∣larly. After dinner Mrs. Griffinburg, Dr. Griffinburg, and Mrs. Harvey, went out of the room. He then took me behind the window-curtain, and began to shew the same indecencies as before. I pleaded much with him, and struggled all I could, and begged and prayed that he would take my life away. I told him I would give that up freely, but never would the other. With that, he said it must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so that night, whether I would or no. Then they came in again. They took me out of that room into some other rooms, to see the house. I told them I thought it was the worst sight I ever saw. They then told me it must be so that night: Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Griffinburg, told me so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did they explain particulars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I was in great distress, and cried very much. After this they came in again, and I drank tea with them. Nothing particular passed at tea. After tea they went up stairs again. Lord Baltimore said, they must do something to divert themselves; that they would play at blindman's buff, and I should play with them. I said I could not play at blindman's buff, I would do no such thing. He said I should not always sit in that manner. I was crying, and he swang me round the room, and said I should play with them. One of the women was blinded, and one of them pretended she had catched me; with that I said positively I would not be blinded. I sat down and cryed again. As soon as he saw that, he came and set down by me, and strove
<PB N="28" REF="010919_0027_0F852929230C4A40"/>to make me look at him. Nothing would make me forget my trouble. I still kept crying, and pleading with God, that he would take me out of time into eternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you speak loud?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether they heard me or no. After this they went to supper, but before they went to supper the two women and he himself all joined together and said, I might as well do it quietly, for it must be so that night. This was some time before supper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any thing particular pass at supper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I eat a little bit, but drank no∣thing, for fear they had put something it it. After sup∣per he ordered them to go to bed; with that they led me out of the room. I was crying. They led me into the bedchamber. The two women began to undress me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you oppose their undressing of you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was in such a tremble and fright, that I had no strength left; therefore I was not able to resist them, but cryed, and begged, and pleaded, that God would take away my life, and preserve me from that wicked creature. Dr. Griffinburg said (he was by then, I did not know it till he spoke) he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, O, my dear Miss Sally, don't cry so, don't take on so, it will be all well by and by. Mrs. Harvey said she never saw any one make such a piece of work in her life: if I was going to be killed I could not do more. I told her I had much rather be killed. I cryed and took on in a very shock∣ing manner, and pleaded much with God to take me out of time into eternity. Then they led me out of that room into the next, and set me down in the elbow chair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were your cloaths pulled off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>My cap was pulled off, but the rest were only unpinned, and such like; with that they set me down and pulled all the rest of my things off, and put me into the bed. When the curtains were open I saw that Lord Baltimore was in bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you saw that, you say you was so terrified, and in such a fright, that you was not able to make resistance. Did you go into the bed with your own accord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they had forced me a-top of the
<PB N="29" REF="010919_0028_0F852929D3FA49D0"/>bed: they drew the curtains, and tucked me up, and went away, as I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened after this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He turned upon me with all the force he could, and forced himself between me, and said he would get into me; with that he lay upon me all the weight he could, and strove to push himself into me with all his might; and I cried and struggled all I could, but he held my mouth together with his fingers, that I might not cry; and strove to lie over me, so much as to smother me. When he had been sometime in me, I felt something come from him; and then he turned off from me as he came on, and left me to live or die as I could. He said nothing to me all night. I laid in such a fright and such a tremble, for fear he should come to me again, I sweat that the drops ran off from me. In the morning he turned upon me in the same manner, and used me in the same manner. I cried out as I had done before, and made all the stuggle I could. He said he never heard such a noise in his life; I should raise the whole house. After this he asked me if I wanted the pot? I said, yes. I got out of bed, I don't know how, and there came a great quantity of blood from me. I strove to get on my things, and to get away, I was so a∣fraid for fear he should pull me in again, that I got a few of my things on in a loose manner; and he said I could not get out, but must stay till he let me out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Before we ask you any other questions, was you at either of these times at all consenting to what he did?</P>

<P>No, not in the least, I made all the strug∣gle both times that I could.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you cry out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you was let out of the bed chamber, in∣to what room did you go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcok.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into the next room, where Mrs. Harvey was, I was not drest. I sat down and cried. Mrs. Har∣vey got up. I began to tell her of the usage I had had, but not particulars. She said, yes, you made noise enough, I heard you. I said, well I might. She said you will like it well enough by and by. I told her no, I should ever hate e∣every thing of the kind; if that was to be my life, it would be a burthen indeed; but I hoped I should not live long. Finding she answered me in a rough manner, I thought with myself, that I had lost every thing that was dear to
<PB N="30" REF="010919_0029_0F85292BC8D84C28"/>me, but my life, how should I do to save that? With this I resolved, to alter my carriage, and do every thing they desired that was immaterial, for these three reasons— That I might not be used ill;—that I might not be sent abroad;—and that I might have some opportunity of re∣turning to London again, which was the only hope I had. By standing at the windows, I thought that some time or other I might see my friends. With this I resolved to alter my carriage, as much as possible, and do every thing they desired that was immaterial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you declare this was a resolution took at that time, and for these reasons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am positive of it as I stand here, taken at that time indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not at any subsequent time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; this was before I had come out of Mrs. Harvey's room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by immaterial things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any things that were innocent. As to di∣versious, I was bred up not to take any, and therefore was resolved not to comply with playing at cards, or dancing, or music, or any thing of that kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean by immaterial, any thing you did not think sinful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was my meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It will be proper to ask you if you are not brought up in a particular seet, and under what deno∣mination are you and your father.</P>

<P>No, only the Sabbath, the Sunday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have been brought up in a very particu∣lar way, I believe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you taught to think it a crime to dance or play at cards?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, and that from the word of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Having said this, inform my Lord and the court what passed the rest of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I came down stairs, Lord Baltimore sat at breakfast; I forget whether Dr. Griffinburg was there or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Were the women there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of them was, the other came after∣wards.
<PB N="31" REF="010919_0030_0F85292BE8E1ED58"/>I took no notice, nor he neither, no farther than this; my Lord said I was not wen, and I must take a powder, (this was before breakfast, before I had eat any). While we were at breakfast, he said to Mrs. Harvey, Miss wants something, does she not? She said, yes, Sir, she wants some clean linen. He said, you shall go to Epsom and buy Miss some muslin for aprons, and things, and she shall work, and that will divert her mind from sitting and thinking. While Mrs. Harvey was gone, he said I should go and take an airing in a boat. This was Tues∣day morning. I told him I had never been upon water, and so was afraid. I had never been upon the water, but only crossed our little river at Cambridge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went out of the house. He said I must run, for sear I should get cold. I did. When I came to the canal, I was all in a tremble, and did not know how to go in, for I was afraid. When I came in, the bottom of the boat was very full of water. I thought that was a very unfit place. I thought it would have killed me, but I thought I was as willing to die as live, therefore I would go. When I was upon the water, he said it would sit me for going abroad: this increased my fears that I had had before. Then, if I remember right, Mrs. Griffinburg said we will take a walk in the park. I then said, if we did, I should be glad to go to such a place, because I fancied there was a foot-path and a gate that way to go out of the park, because the way they brought me had no foot-path near it; therefore I thought, if I could any ways escape, I could not go that way, so wanted to see if this other gate would lead me out; but whether she came at my thoughts or not, I cannot tell, but we did not go a sixth part of the way, I believe.— Then we came in again, and Mrs. Harvey, some time after this, came home, and brought a hat, and some white ribbons to put on the hat, and some pink ribbon, which she said she had bought for a night ribbon. With that Lord Baltimore said he liked the pink ribbon best upon the hat. With that I said, if he liked that best I would put it on, for the same reason as before, that I said I would do any thing in my power that was imma∣terial; so I put on the pink ribbon. When we went up stairs again, she said she would have the white ribbons
<PB N="32" REF="010919_0031_0F85292C9B7079A0"/>tied up for favours for a wedding. I said I should not think of such a thing as a wedding, indeed. She insist∣ed upon it. She made up one for herself, and made a∣nother and fixed it to my breast, but whether she pinned it I do not know. Then we came down again, and she said to Mrs. Griffinburg, how fine we were, and that she should have one too; therefore when I came back they made me tie up one for her. At night he brought me the Spectator to read, which, when I found something serious in it, he came and took it away, and gave some of Dr. Swift's works, which was very foolish and absurd, that I would not read it: I said it was nonsense and stuff. That was all I remember that night. He did not desire me to go to bed to him that night. I went to bed to Mrs. Harvey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you made no application to Mrs. Harvey after this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; as they would not let me go before, I knew they would not let me go after. There was a∣nother circumstance which I believe I forgot, that was this: He (Lord Baltimore) said one day, (I believe on Friday) that if he was to be so soolish as to let me go ac∣cording to my foolish defire, did I think my friends would take me in? I told him yes, I knew my friends knew me very well, and would take me in; but if they would not, that should be no excuse to him, for I would beg my bread from door to door rather than stay there. He said I should go and expose him finely indeed. I told him if he would let me go then I would not. He asked me if I would promise him? I said I would. He asked me, if I would take an oath? I said I would, upon the Bible, and I would keep it. For this reason I did not im∣portune Mrs Harvey, because I knew she would not let me go; for as I knew he was afraid I should expose him before, I knew he might be afraid I should expose him now. Afterwards, I only importuned every day that I might go to London again to see my friends. I impor∣tuned Dr. Griffinburg, and all of them, as they were present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now you come to Wednesday morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>We took an airing again in the close boat on the water in the evening of that day. Just at tea∣time there came in two gentlemen and a lady that had been sent for from London, as I understood. After they had drank tea, he called for a sheet, which surprised me a good deal, and I was afraid they were going to play
<PB N="33" REF="010919_0032_0F85292D70C94DB8"/>at some mischief, but I found some time after that they were going to act the magie lanthorn. While they were acting the magic lanthorn, they hung up several sheets across the room, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> went and danced behind it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a thing rather they call the ltahan shade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>But while they were acting this, the lady that came down from London said, that is Lord Balti∣more that is acting the old man. There was a person acting the part of an old man. With that I was glad to hear the name, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had never heard it before; and thonght if I could now get to London and get a pen and ink, I would write a letter and throw it out of the window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Till that time you did not know the per∣son that had done you this mischief was Lord Balti∣more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not. Next morning, which was Thursday, I intreated Dr. Griffinburg that he would ask my Lord to let us go to London again. He said he would. He went, and came some time after to me, and told me we were to go home that day; but I was not satisfied till I saw the coach that we were to go to London in. That day, the women went out into the park, and want∣ed to run, and defired me to run along with them, which I did a little way; but I strove to drop them, which they did not let me, but came up with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened the rest of that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not remember any thing particular till I came to London after dinner, about four or five o'clock. I sat in the same situation in the coach I did before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When did you come to London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>That evening; they drove much as they did before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened on Thursday night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing particular, only I was fearful I should be obliged to go to bed to him, and was very much terrified. We went up the back way into the same room we was at first; then Mrs. Harvey said I must go to bed to Lord Baltimore. I said I would not do any such thing. She said I must go, to be sure; had not I been before? I said I would do no such thing. I then made another excuse apphcable to my sex, and desired that she would go and beg me off, but she would not go, there∣fore I went myself rather than go to bed. I went to him
<PB N="34" REF="010919_0033_0F85292E23F1A518"/>and told him, and he gave me leave to go to bed else∣where. I lay that night along with Mrs. Harvey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The next day was Friday, what palled then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very dull as usual. I dont know whether I cried or no, but was very dull. By and by, towards noon, I believe, he said he would introduce me to the other part of the family; and then he told me, if I would be quiet a few days longer, and make myself satisfied and easy, and not tell any of the family what had paffed between him and me, I should see my father, and if I liked to live with my father best, we should have a house and live together. He had put some money in∣to my hand, and told me, after I had seen my father I should go where I pleased, do as I liked lay out the mo∣ney as I chose, and if I liked to go to meeting I should go. He ordered my hat and cloak to be brought down, and then he went in and fetched a woman which they call Madam Saunier, or some such name, and told her that there was a lady come to be a companion to the young ladies. He told her I was a very religious lady, and something of that kind. She said she would take care of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is governess to the young ladies. Then he introduced me into the family, and told them I was recommended by my father as a companion to the young ladies, and then went out. This was a part of the house I had not been in, except the first night, when I believe they shewed it me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You had a sair opportunity now of telling Madam Saunier of the injury you had received.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had laid the strictest injunctions upon me; and I thought as they were his servants they would be as the rest had been; therefore I thought it was best to keep it to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What passed in the whole of that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was you with the ladies in the afternoon of that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S Woodcock</SPEAKER>
<P>I was</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was my Lord with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he only came in at meals. I faw no∣thing more of Mrs. Harvey; Mrs. Griffinburg only came in then and brought the victuals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened that evening?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing particular, only after he went
<PB N="35" REF="010919_0034_0F85292ED9002580"/>up stairs to bed, he sent Mrs. Griffinburg to fetch me in. As soon as I went into the room I burst into tears. This was on Friday night. He was in bed. She want into the room, but did not stay. He asked me to come to bed: I told him no, I would not. He assured me if I would come to bed he would not meddle with me, he would only lie by my side. I told him I would not, over and over; at last he insisted upon it that I should come; and knowing chey would ute force if I did not do it, I went into bed. As soon as I had got into bed he jumped out of bed and setched the candle; and when he had done so, he strove to tear up my shift to see my nakedness; I struggled with all my might, and would not let him get a full fight: I cried out, and struggled all I could. With that, he exposed himself in the same manner, and wanted me to look at him; but I would not. After that he went and set the candle down again, and then he came and strove to do the same things again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you consent that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; not at all. I straggled all I could a∣gainst it. He could not do what he intended, by reason of my then situation. He did not meddle with me any more, only pulled my hand to him; I told him I thought it was impoffible that any creature could take pleasure in such vile abominations: there was nothing more par∣ticular that night, that I know of. On Saturday morn∣ing he got up, and sent Mrs. Griffinburg in to take me up When she came in I was very i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: she desired I would not stay to dress myself there, but said I must go into a∣nother room, and had me into another room which I had not seen before, where there was a bed. When I was got there, she seeing the condition I was in, asked me if I would go to bed again: I told her no; but finding I could not stand it, I told her yes, I would. I went to bed, and laid about two hours; but they came so often to me, that I could not get any sleep. They came and took me up: they sent the maid in to drets me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who is she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know her name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had you any converiation with the maid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Then there came a woman to take measure of me for a gown. Just after that Mrs. Griffin∣burg came in, and said my Lord wanted me in his room. I went in. He asked me what I would have for a gown? I said I don't care any thing about it; I would as lief wear what I have. He said, would I have blue? I told
<PB N="36" REF="010919_0035_0F85292F9BEAD1F0"/>him it might be blue if it would, I did not care. He saw some bruises upon my hand, as he stood at the window, upon my hand and arm both, and asked how they came; I told him he did it the first night, and that he had made it worse again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was that true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was strictly true. I went into that room where I was at first, and they brought me up some gauz∣es and petticoats, and said I must chuse some; but he had fixed upon the colour of the petticoat himself; and as for the gauzes, I told her I did not care, she might take which she pleased. I took the petticoat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any thing else pass?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She said, as I was a milliner, I could make the caps myself. My Lord said the petticoat should be a light one, and that was light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you hear my Lord say so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I did, but am not sure. I said I was so ill I could not work there. She desired I would tell her what I wanted more; I sat down something a∣bout wires, but I don't know what. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid left the pen and ink, but came back again in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I asked her if she could not leave it, because I wanted it: she said no, she could not, she would bring it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What did you want it for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>To write to my father, and fling it out of the window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did she bring you the pens and ink?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S Woodcock</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Mrs. Griffinburg desired I would take the work and work with the ladies. I took an apron and ruffles to make; and there was a lady to drink tea that day; after tea, Lord Baltimore said, he thought the la∣dies should go te cards. The eldelt Miss entreated me very much to play, but I refused, and said I could not: I did not chuse it. As soon as they had got to play, I retired to the next room; Mrs. Griffinburg came unto me, and told me she wanted me to see the apartment she had been preparing for me, for that I could not have that room I was in in the morning; theresore she carri∣ed me up into a stone garret: it seemed to be all stone; it was very cold, and struck like a well, and was among all the fervants, that I was very much frightened and uneafy about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was there a window?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a window cut out of the lead∣ing; I could see nothing but a bit of the leading of the
<PB N="37" REF="010919_0036_0F852930562F0BF0"/>house, which looked out upon the gutter, and a bit of a sky light. I was very much frightened and uneasy, and thought it very odd I could not have a better room in such a house as that. I was afraid that now he had done with me himself, that he did intend I should be ex∣posed to any body that he might send. Upon that I told Mrs. Griffinburg that I durst not lie there; she, upon that, said, to oblige me, she would bring up a little bed, and He there a night or two. Then I came down stairs again to supper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With whom did you sup?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the lady that came to see him, Doc∣tor Griffinburg, Madam Saunier, and the governess, the two Misses, and Lord Baltimore; but I neither eat nor drank. On Sunday I kept up in the garret, and they came often and disturbed me, that I could have no rest any where. I came down stairs to breakfast, and then went up again, and came down again to dinner; and after dinner I stood up at the window, and as I was sstanding up at the window, (this was the corner win∣dow, and looked toward Hampstead) as I was standing, I thought I saw Mr. Davis. the person to whom I was en∣gaged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who was in the room with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two more ladies that came to dinner that day, Madam Saunier, and the governess and the two children, and myself; they six were standing up at the fire side while I went to the window; there I saw Mr. Davis; and when I first saw him I was so struck I could not tell how to stand; and fearing that he should not see me, when he looked up I thought he did not know me; but he went behind a wall towards the Foundling Hospital, and there peeped two or three times, till I was sure he knew me. He took a book out of his pocket, and made a motion with his hand for me to write; with that I waved my hand for him to come further, but he did not understand me; therefore, when I went to the next window, at first sight I lost him, but seeing him again, I waved my hand for him to come further, and then I ran into the next room, which was the room Lord Baltimore generally sat in; but I ran in hap hazard, without thinking whether he was there or no, and called out to him in great agony, I cannot come to you! I cannot come to you! This was the other corner room, the west side of the house; I crossed the room the bow-window is in, to go to that
<PB N="38" REF="010919_0037_0F85293115D14FD8"/>room. He said are you well? But I prevented him, by asking, is my father well! He said Yes, he is well, and we are all well; he said then, how do you do? Then he said, where is Mrs. Harvey? I said I knew nothing of her. He then said, is all well? With that I was ready to drop: I said, good bye, and shut down the window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the reason of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feared some of the women would come; and before I could get out of the room Lord Baltimore came in. I was so flurried and was all in a tremble, that I did not speak to him as he came in, nor he to me. After this I intreated the maid to get me a pen, ink, and paper, and bring it up into my room, meaning the garret, and not tell any body of it, because I wanted it to amuse me. I lay in the garret that night, and next morning she brought me a pen and ink. I began to write imme∣diately to my father, but was so prevented that I could not go on with my letter: this is a part of it <STAGE>(<HI>produced</HI>)</STAGE> I did not throw it out of the window: This was on Monday morning. While I was writing this letter, Mrs. Griffinburg came, and said the milliner had brought me some caps; I said I did not care to come down: I told Mrs. Griffinburg she might take what she pleased; she said, I must go down: With that, I went to the milli∣ner; she had brought some caps and cloaks: With that, I took one that I thought looked the decentest, and that was all; Mrs. Griffinburgh intreated me very much to speak for more things: and said I must have some a∣prons. I asked the woman if she had any flowered mus∣lin; she said, she would bring it when she came again; that was the substance of what passed then. I went and I had my breakfast with the family; Then I went up into my garret again, and Mrs. Griffinburg came after me. I asked where my Lord was? she asked if I want∣ed him? I told her, yes. I wanted to know if ever he in∣tended I should see my friends again; for I could not bear to live so. She desired I would take my work and go down stairs; which accordingly I did: And soon af∣ter I came in, Lord Baltimore came in, and clapt me upon the shoulder, as I sat with my back to the door; and told me he was coming to tell me something that would please me very much, that I should see my father that day without fail: With this, to be sure I was pleas∣ed, and went up stairs with intent to put my things on. Mrs. Griffinburgh followed me, and said my father, was sent for to come to her house, and that I must make
<PB N="39" REF="010919_0038_0F852931DD31B970"/>haste, and go directly; for he would be there before I could get there; she helped to put on my things; and I came down stairs into the room next the Foundling Hospital; there was a lady that had been there the day before. Lord Baltimore began to tell her what a religious lady I was; and that he was sorry for many things he had said to me. What his reason was for this I don't know, except he thought I should expose him too much. Some time after this, he led me into another room; and when he got me there, he said I now was going to see my father; that he was sent for, and I was going to Mrs. Griffinburg's to meet him. He told me I must say I was willing to stay; and if I would tell my father I was satisfied and easy, he would do any thing for me that I desired: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him that I would, but I must see my father alone: He said, then he would speak to him first. I told him, he might, but I would speak to him alone.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Explain your meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>My meaning was this, Sir, that I might put him into some way of geting me away, if I could not get away with him; then he said, I should take the little Miss, and I should say to my father, I was a companion of that lady; to that I only said, very well: Then we were sent on to Mrs. Griffinburg's house, with an intent to meet my father, in Dean street, Soho; I went to this house; when I was there, I said to Mrs. Griffinburg, I thought you said my father would be here, before I should get here; but I see you have deceived me, as you have done all along. She said he would come presently. In about two hours after this, or rather more, Lord Baltimore and Dr. Griffinburg came. As soon as he came in, I said, I thought you told me I was to see my father; but I see you have deceived me, as you have all along; and I see I shall not see my sather to-night; he said, yes, you shall: But what do you think has happened? Your father has taken up Mrs. Harvey, and put her into the round-house: This gave me some pleasure, but I dared not shew it; I did not know what to answer; at last, I said, I did not suppose that would do any good, for she would not tell where I was: Soon after this, in came another man, and said, Lord Baltimore's house was beset with Justice Fielding's men: He fell into a passion, and said my father must be a fine man indeed, to set to work such rogues as Justice Fielding, and his men, were, that they were the greatest
<PB N="40" REF="010919_0039_0F85293296031DD8"/>rognes that could be. I was frightened, and thought my life and my friends were in danger, because he was in such a rage; and I was afraid, having much about the same opinion of him, that he had of Justice Field∣ing, that may-be he might send some of his men and set the homse on fire, or do some mischief. After this there was a great demur about Mrs. Harvey's being at the round-house, and how they should get at her, and get her bailed: Sometime after this, I found that Mrs. Griffinburg had been to set if she could come at her; Mrs. Griffinburg said so, that she could not; with that they were in a great taking, in what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to proceed to get this woman bailed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Baltimore, and Dr. and Mrs. Griffinburg; then I studied what I should say and do: At last, I said, that if they had got Mrs. Harvey (I spoke to Lord Baltimore) they might depend upon it, they would never deliever her up, till I was set at liberty: I told them, if they had a mind Mrs. Harvey should be set free, it must be me that could do it; and if they would let me see my father, and I could settle things to my mind, I could release her if I pleased. In two or three hours they got a man to go, upon account of speaking English: they said, if Dr. Griffinburg went, they supposed that the old man (meaning my father) would think he should be run away with: Then they got some tradesman to go along with them to carry the letter, which I had then wrote, if I remember right, at Dr. Griffinburg's, to my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the purport of that letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>The intent of it was for my father to come to me: We went then to Whitechapel; I went in a coach with Lord Baltimore, Dr. Griffinburg, this man, the Doctor's niece, and the little girl: This was on Monday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was there any servants attending the coach?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw one run on the side of the coach as I went; it was Pierini, they call him the valet de cham∣bre: We ment to a tavern; I cannot say what it was; I believe I should know it again, if I saw it: There was only a little boy that led the way up to a back room: When we came there, this man, the tradefinan, was sent with the letter to my father: He came back and brought word, that my father had been out ever since nine in the morning, in search of me, and brought the
<PB N="41" REF="010919_0040_0F852933580AF3F8"/>letter back. I was very loth to go back again; I did not know what to do. I wrote to the landlord of our house, to tell my father to be as easy as he could; for I would send for him next morning at ten, as Lord Bal∣timore told me I should: At that time at the tavern he told me I should send for him in the morning: It was the land-lord of my father's house, whose name is Berry. The tradelman brought word back again, my father was not come home as yet; so Lord Baltimore would go back again, and said, he supposed they were making a fine piece of work at the other end of the town. We went back; and when we came to Covent-Garden, the coach stopped, and the tradesman got out, and went to Justice Fielding's, according to their orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did he come back again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did, along with Justice Fielding's clerk, who brought a card, with his compliments, and that I should see my friends there: I did not know what to say to the man; I made no answer, but gave the card into Lord Baltimore's hand; he read it, and said I should not go. With that, I told the man to tell my friends, that I was there (I mean at Dr. Griffinburg's house) and that I desired my friends to come to me there directly; the man did not come any more; but there was messenger after messenger, came to tell him of men being about the house, and a great mob in the yard; and withal, that there was some women had been crying there. With that, I was afraid it should come out, that I had seen Mr. Davis at the window. I beg∣ged of my Lord, to let me speak to the man first. I found there was another messenger come about some∣thing; I went out of the room, and there was Broughton, which we call the Steward: I asked him what the woman said? He said I was seen out of the window; I told him I was, and I wanted to speak to him about that. I told him I thought that my life depended on its being known; and therefore begged, if he had any value for a person's life, he would not mention to my Lord, that I was seen at the window. He said he would promise no such think, his bread depended upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I told him he need not fear his bread, he might get it another way. At last, he promised me, that he would not tell him unless he asked him. Then I came into the room, and what passed, I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What was the reason of this application to conceal it from my Lord?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="010919_0041_0F85293417A6CB58"/>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thought may-be he would murder me that night, or send me away. After this there was a great deal of consusion, and they talked in another language; I was fearful they were contriving to go some other way, or send me abroad. My Lord was so frightened, he was afraid to go home for fear they should take me out of the coach: I told him they could not take me out unless I would, and that I would not go with Justice Fielding's men. After some time, we set out to go to Lord Baltimore's again. When we came within two or three doors, the coach stopped, by whose order I do not know; Right against the coach there were several men standing; I got up to see if I could see any of my friends; but Lord Baltimore pul∣led me down, asked me what I got up for, and ordered the coach to drive on immediately: which they did as fast as they could; and the men strove to'get into the yard along with the coach; Justice Fielding's men, I believe they were; they strove to get into the gates, and get∣ting out of the coach, I cried out, let the men come in: He pulled me in, and said I should not stay. With that, we went up stairs; when we got there, the little Jew came up, and said, my Lord, Piereni wants you: With that, I got up, and walked about the room in great distress, fearing it was coming out that I had been seen out of the window. I thought I would strive to hide it; I plucked up all the courage I could, and asked him as soon as he came in, what Piereni wanted. He said I had spoke to somebody out of the window; I told him I had; he asked what I had said: I told him; but did not tell my distress because I was afraid: When I had told him, he said he could not blame me, he should have done the same himself. He supposed I was glad to speak to the first I had seen. With this, I was rejoiced, I had been in such a terror before, lest he thould kill me for it. After this, he and the doctor talked a good while in some other language; what, I don't know. By and by, Lord Baltimore said I must go to bed to him; that I must lie with him that night, or he should be wretched: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; he promised me be would not meddle with me; I thought if I did not, he would make me go to bed to him, so I did go to bed to him, and he did not meddle with me. On Tuesday morning he got up first, and went away, and sent Mrs. Griffinburg to take me up. She came, and said Lord Baltimore wanted me directly: With that, I got up and went to him. When
<PB N="43" REF="010919_0042_0F852934E4524B48"/>I came to him, he said, Well, now we will write to your father, and send for him as proposed. I had heard over night, that one Mr. Watts was to come in the morning at ten o'clock: So I said I thought it was bet∣ter to stay till ten o'clock, before I sent to my father. I thought it would be Mr. Davis would come by the name of Watts. At ten o'clock I wrote a letter to my father, the purport of which, if I remember right, was this, that I begged my friends would come with all the decency and respect becoming a nobleman's house: He took the letter, and shewed it Mr. Brown, the attorney, and seemed very much pleased with it, and sent it away. After this, he wanted to know what I should say to my father, and whether I would say as I had told him, that I was willing to stay. I said I would, but I would see my father alone by myself. With that, he said, he would do any thing to make me easy. With that, I said very well, but could not tell what to answer him. He said I should have a house to live in, and live with my friends, if I liked it better than living with him. Just upon that, Piereni came in, and said, my Lord, here is Mr. Watts come; but before that, I should have told you, my Lord said, that whoever came, I must say I was willing to stay. The man came up, and said, there was Mr. Watts. Lord Baltimore went out to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who was left with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know; there was Mrs. Griffin∣burg and Dr. Griffinburg, backwards and forwards; but whether they were in the room or no, I can't say. My Lord brought Mr. Watts up stairs; he was in the first room, and I was in the farthest room; he was brought up stairs; The doors happened to stand a jar, that I could just see them, but I could not hear them. It I remem∣ber right, there was Piereni in the middle room. My Lord talked with Mr. Watts for about ten minutes; and then my Lord came first, and Mr. Watts almost behind him; and my Lord said, Miss, here is a friend of your's; I said, I don't know the gentleman: He then said, Miss, you don't know me, nor do I know you; but I am come from your friends, to know if you are here by your own consent? I answered, yes; but I want to see my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In that very form of words?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it was; I was in such a flurry at that time, I can't be positive. He said, very well, Miss, if you are here with your own consent, no body has a right
<PB N="44" REF="010919_0043_0F8529370AB63000"/>to take you away; your servant, Madam; and then he talked with Lord Baltimore again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What happened to you after this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went into the next room; I did not know what to think of Mr. Watts, and I had no thoughts at that time of a lawyer; therefore I went into the middle of the room, to see if I could see any friends about; when I saw none, I opened the window; this was on the first floor: I saw several friends at that time, but one pretty near that I knew, Mr. Cay: He asked me, if I was there by my own consent? I said yes; but I said I wanted to see my father. He said, my father would never come within those walls; I then turned away in a great trembling, and said, then I never shall see him; that was my way of thinking at that time; I thought, that as they would not let him come in, I should never get out. After that, Lord Paltimore came in again, and said, I must go to Lord Mansfield's, and said, I must say I was there with my own consent, and not to tell Lord Mansfield particulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me ask you this question: Did you before this time, know Lord Mansfield?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never, as I know of, heard his name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you take in the news-papers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I did not think of his being a magistrate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did Lord Baltimore explain to you, who he was, or why you was to go to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Baltimore said, if I did not stand by him now, he should be undone: He then said, will you be faithful to me now, and keep your word; other∣wise I am undone? I said I would? but I would tell my Lord Mansfield, that I wanted to see my father a∣lone. He said, if I would be easy, and tell him I was easy and satisfied, I should have a house, and live with my friends, and have the young man. With that, I told him I would say, I was willing to be there, as I promised him before, but would see my friends alone. He asked, if I would tell my friends the particulars? I told him, yes; I would tell my friends all the truth. After this, he said very little. Another message came for him. He came up, and said, we were to go to Lord Mansfield's immediately. I said, very well, I was very willing. Mr. Brown, the lawyer, my Lord, and myself, went together in Mr. Brown's chariot.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now tell all that passed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as I came into Lord Mansfield's doors, my Lord Baltimore had hold of my hand up the steps; I clapt my hand upon Mr. Potts, one of the gen∣tlemen that stood in the hall, whom I knew; and he took no notice of me; which struct me very much; because Lord Baltimore had told me, that my friends would not look upon me; and seeing such a repulse from Mr. Potts it struck me very much; I saw several other of my friends there; but I did not speak to any body, nor any body to me; I went into another room, and Lord Mansfield met me at the door? Lord Mansfield asked me to come in; and Lord Baltimore was to stay in the next room; then Lord Mansfield and I were alone, only another gentlemen present. I was not then apprised who Lord Mansfield was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Tell, distinctly, what passed between you and Lord Mansfield.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The first words that I remember, were these: Child, was you carried there against your will?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I said, yes, my Lord. He then asked me, if I was kept there against my will; I said, quite against my will; my Lord then said, quite against your will; I said again, quite against my will. He was going to ask me something; but what the words were, I don't know; I said, my Lord, I don't care to go into particulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why did you not tell my Lord Mansfield at that time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was because I did not know, that he had power to release me; if I had known, I should cer∣tainly have told him what had happened. He then said, Miss, I think you are of age? I said, yes: He said, well, Child, are you willing to stay with this man? I said, my Lord, as things are as they are, I am willing, but not without seeing my friends alone: He asked me, what friends? I said my father and my sisters. He desired them to be called. Then he ordered the man would bring Lord Baltimore through such a place, and take me out at the other door, that I might not see my Lord, and there I met my friends alone.</P>

<P>My father and the next sister to me. Soon after that, my other sister came; there was no other person that I remember, when I was with my friends, I asked them, if Lord Mansfield had a power to set me at liberty? They assured me, he had; I asked it again? They said, yes.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did the questions come from you to them, or they put the questions to you?</P>

<SP>

<P>What did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I said, I was heartily willing to go home with them, and desired Lord Mansfield might be called directly, that I might tell him I would go home. Lord Mansfield came to the door.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who was in the room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father, and two sisters; he said, child are you willing to go home with Lord Balimore, or your father? I said with my father, my Lord, if it is in your power to let me go; he said, child it is in my power to let you go; but how comes this change of mind? I said, my Lord, because till I saw them, I did not know you had power to release me; he then said child, it is in my power to let you go, let your friends be called, that they may hear your declaration.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know whether Lord Mansfield ex∣plained to you at first his power to release you?</P>

<P>From there I went to Mr. Yeoman's at Westminster, I staid there from that Monday to the Mon∣day three weeks? and from thence I went to Mr. Rutt's in Friday street, and stayed there from Monday to the Friday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e'nnight; from Mr. Rutt's, I went to Mr. Keene's, and staid from that time till the fourth week after my going, and from thence I went to Mr. Wallis's; I went to no other persons till I came to Kingston.</P>

<P>What, not to Mr. Potts's?</P>

<P>No.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are all or either of these gentlemen concerned in carrying on this prosecution, you are not able to do it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A set of gentlemen have lent my father money, upon a note of hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understand from your evidence, that you was brought to my house without knowing where you was coming to; that you was, during the whole time you was there, under absolute confinement; that you would have get away if any opportunity had offered and if any opportunity of complaining had offered, you would have done it; do you insist upon this as the truth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think I understand you, that for the first four days, you neither eat nor drank any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, the first two days, to my knowledge, I don't know that I eat any thing, from Wednesday till Saturday morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And then you only had a dish of tea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not understand from your evi∣dence, that you had eat any thing till Sunday dinner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The toast and wine I had on Saturday night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you take any thing solid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't remember that I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You must be very much exhausted, and yet on Sunday you had a long discourse with me, to prove that there was a God, a heaven, a hell, and subjects of that kind; how old are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am twenty-seven.</P>

<P>Will you swear you are no older?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know I need tell; I am twenty∣nine, and that is my age; I cannot exactly tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To the best of your belief, how old are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I am thirty next July, I cannot be sure of that, whether I am or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How often had you seen me, before you was brought to my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Only three times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have told us I expressed some res∣pect and attachment to you; had I never taken the op∣portunity to give you a civil salute, when you was be∣hind the counter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, you never did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You talked of my having said, I would bring a lady to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understood you, that you would bring a lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Might I not have said, I would send?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I understood that you would bring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have told us, you never saw Har∣vey, but twice before this time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S Woodcock</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever see Isaacs before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Isaacs, I never saw before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You had no suspicion where you was going?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you trusted yourself with this woman, you had never seen but twice before. You have given an account of drinking tea, the amusement at te∣totum, the seeing the house, and supper, that there was some rudeness offered that night, and that you resented it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was that repeated the next day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did any thing happen the next day, either to make you more alarmed, or make you easier. Was any rudeness offered the second night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing indecent as I can remember, but violent threats of doing for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think you said something of Mr.
<PB N="50" REF="010919_0049_0F85293F0B501A58"/>Smith's drawing your picture; that Mr. Smith was there the third day, drawing your picture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was a man that was called Richard Smith; Lord Baltimore took that name, and then he said he was not Richard Smith, but it was somebody else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it upon the second or the third day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think the second day; I reckoned it the second day, because I did not reckon Wednesday one; it was on Friday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you take any refreshment that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You say, you was even crying at the time your picture was taking; that you neither drank tea, nor supped; in what room did the rest of the com∣pany drink tea and sup?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the room with the bow-window, that looks into Southampton-row.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That bow-window commands a view of seven or eight foot paths, that branch off; does it not? Do you recollect that Mr. Smith was of the party that drank tea and supped that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray will you tell me when you first heard that I had sent any thing to your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>On Friday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who did you hear it from first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord <HI>Baltimore;</HI> when I was pleading, that if he had no compassion for me, he might have for my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did it come from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not Dr. Griffinburgh tell you first of all, that I had sent a sum of money to your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't remember that he did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you express great satisfaction upon hearing I had sent such a sum of money to your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If I understood you, you did not lie down till Friday night; and that you did not pull off your cloaths while in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did on Sunday night; but I never had my cloaths off before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have given an account of your
<PB N="51" REF="010919_0050_0F85293FA870D438"/>going to Woodcote; had you any notion, when you go into the coach, that you was going to Woodcote?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had no-body told you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You was given to understand by me, that you was to to take an airing, and come back, and then see your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In your first information, as read in the King's-Bench, you said you was carried into the coach by force, and they told you, you was going to Woodcote. You have described your sitting in the coach between me and Mrs. Harvey; Did you sit forward or backward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My face was to the horses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You said, Mrs. Harvey was ordered by me to sit forward, so as to shut up the window as well as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So that you could not so well see the people as they passed by.—You said that, when the coach stopt, you wished it might overturn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My reason was, I hoped that, by that means I might have made my escape, if any opportunity had happened. The coach did not stop at all, as I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was the glasses down, or up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They were up, till we got off the stones; and then Lord Baltimore put one of them down a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, as soon as you found that, instead of being carried out for an airing, you was car∣ried further; you was ill disposed to partake of the mirth that went forward in the coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I understand, you did not know you was going to Woodcote, till you came to Epsom: there are a great many steps, are there not, that lead up to the house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who got out of the coach first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell; I was led up the steps directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Into what room;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe the first room; we staid there some time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did I propose to take an airing in the park?</P>

<PB N="52" REF="010919_0051_0F85294084E15FD8"/>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I might go out, but I can't say whether I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be glad to know if you will swear now, that when you went out of the door to the canal, you did not lay hold of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and run along with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is a pretty strong circumstance; did you go upon the canal before dinner?</P>

<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, before dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>What time did you set out from Lord Balti∣more's house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>About two o'clock.</P>

<SP>

<P>What time did you get to Woodcote?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>About four.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How soon might you dine?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe in about half an hour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where did you dine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the great dining-room, up one pair of stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was there the first insult was offer∣ed behind the curtain, was it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> Was it at that time that I talked to you of coming to bed, that I told you it must be that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he said it must be that night; I got away from him; I don't know that I made him any an∣swer to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you say, upon your oath, that when I talked to you of your coming to bed that night, that you said nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, I would sooner give him my life a hundred times over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Upon your oath, did not you say, if I would use you faithfully and tenderly, you would let me go to bed to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I said no such thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you not say, some other time might be more convenient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where did you drink tea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Below stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not the magnificence of that place strike you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it did; though I would rather have been in the poorest cottage.</P>

<PB N="53" REF="010919_0052_0F852940D719AE58"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you say, that you believed that room was finer than any room in the Queen's Palace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know; possibly I might.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think you told us, you eat nothing at supper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I eat a little bit, but drank nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you did not drink several glasses of wine to my health? Who first withdrew to go to bed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am not positive.</P>
</SP>

<P>Was it not me?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you and Mrs. Harvey go out of the room before me, to go to bed, or after?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How long might you be in the room before you was put into my room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot form any judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can you recollect your desiring to have a little water to wash your feet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No? the women proposed it: they talked of my having water to wash my feet, but I re∣fused it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How soon, after you got into the room, was it, before you observed Dr. Griffinburg in the room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not many minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it almost immediately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe almost, but can't exactly say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Doctor, I think, did not inter∣pose in any other manner than by endeavouring to comfort you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is pretty extraordinary, that Dr. Griffinburg should be in the room at all, at such a time; what reason did he give?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must ask that of him, Sir; I did not hear him give any reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The two women led you into my room; can you tell, whether the doctor staid, or went away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have given an account of the womens having put you to bed, of having tucked up the cloaths, and going out of the room; and that in the morning I got up to open the door to you; you
<PB N="54" REF="010919_0053_0F852941A1FFEB20"/>have described the insults offered you; I shall not wound your modesty, to repeat the account of them. —Did you sleep that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all that I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He lay very still the whole night, I don't know whether he was asleep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have described yourself as being under dreadful apprehensions, left I should repeat it a second time, why did you not endeavour to save your∣self from that second insult, by endeavouring to get out of bed, and find your way out of the room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For this reason; I was in such a fright, I dared not stir hand or foot, for fear he should hear me, and turn to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In what room did you breakfast, in the morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first room below stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At what time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't particularly tell that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You had so far composed yourself, that you had intended to do every thing that was only trivial; to give into my ways, and for that reason you pinned the ribbons on; did not you puss them up ac∣cording to the fashion, that I said they were puffed up too high?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are puffed up no higher than are commonly done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You wore the hat I presume?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now as to these ribbons, you say they were new made up ribbons, but that they were made up by request of Mrs. Harvey, and the other woman?— Did not you think that breaking in upon your rule?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did it by compulsion, not by free choice</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you think any force would be used?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were very rough with me, and I thought they would be rougher, if I did refuse it.</P>

<P>How long might you wear these vibbons?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some of the millenery goods were gauze, were they not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you make Mrs. Harvey a present of some gauze?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect, among other a∣musements, your being carried to see the house, and the library. Was there not a book of prints that took your fancy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did look at them. The Doctor brought them into the room for me to look at, but not at my desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You was sometimes in the park, and sometimes on the water?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Once upon the water that day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was useless to you to discover any particular grief for what had happened, and you did not discover it in your countenance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my counenance I did, I was very dull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You eat and drank at dinner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The same at supper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There was a gloom then. You was out of spirits, and melancholy; where did you lie that night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>With Mrs. Harvey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was thought a little strange and extraordinary that I did not want again to lie with you. I think you and all the company laughed heartily upon the occasion: Will you deny that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I will: I was glad he did not lie with me again, but I did not laugh about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was there any laughing upon the occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not that I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think upon the next day you made a visit with Dr. Griffinburgh, to see a poor woman in the house who had broke her leg?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Dr. Griffinburg carried me to see her, but not at my desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe while he stayed in that room, you went down for your hat and cloak to take a walk in the park?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="56" REF="010919_0055_0F852943246DA348"/>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>We went all in the park together, but this was when we came back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you don't recollect your going out of that room for your hat and cloak, to take a turn with Dr. Griffinburgh; how many times might you have been in the park with Mrs Griffinburg only?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not above once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you recollect being on the other side of the pales above the canal with Mrs. Griffinburg only?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How far might you go with Mrs. Griffinburg only?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>About half a furlong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe there were a great many workmen laying out a piece of ground by the canal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There were.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And there were workmen altering a stair case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there were, and putting up paper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then for the reasons you have given, you did not think right to mention to any body what had happened to you while you were at Woodcote? what day did the visitors come from London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The visiters came on Wednesday, two gentlemen and a lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You was sufficiently composed to re∣ceive the lady, and do the honours of the house, to wait on the lady, and shew her the pictures, and what you thought might be agreeable to her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She had a mind to see the pictures, and I shewed her the pictures in the room she was in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you assist in preparing the sheets, and putting the things in order for the exhibition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I did take a needle, in order to do a little of it; not above one bit of thread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And you let them a few pins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not; there was a pincushtion on the ground, I might stick a few of those pins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was you on the light or dark side after this apparatus was got ready?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>On the dark side. Lord Baltimore was acting the old man part of the time, and another part be came and fat by me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you fit upon my knee?</P>

<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you pledge your credit upon it, that you did not sit upon my knee, and did not kiss me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kiss him! no that I did not. Lord Bal∣timore came and crowded himself in the same chair where I sat, that was all; I did not sit on his lap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I was upon your knee!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not that I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not the cords break, and the sheets tumble upon the ground, after the company had taken so much pains?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe notwithstanding the misfor∣tunes you were so much depressed with, you laughed very heartily at it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I might laugh, but I did not laugh hear∣tily, that I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you say you did not laugh hear∣tily at it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I can't say I did not, I don't know that I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You was on the right side to see the exhibition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was it not amusing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it an amusement beneath gen∣tlemen of sense to employ themselves in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you laugh at that time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, very little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you walk with Mrs. Forrest a∣bout the house, and have some conversation with her?</P>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I had none.</P>

<P>Do you recollect her asking you how long you had been in this family?</P>

<P>She asked me no such thing.</P>

<P>Yes, we did in different carriages.</P>

<P>No, I did not; I supported myself as well as I could.</P>

<P>You have given an account of your being introduced to the governess of the young ladies; did you consider it as an innocent thing then, to impose upon these young ladies?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I did not present myself to the gover∣ness as one come out of the country, but I did not con∣tradict what he said, because he promised in a few days I should see my father.</P>

<P>Consider, you was hazarding every thing against nothing: If your father was there, still you would have been safe if you had gone off; if your father was not there, you would have been safe, and yet it never occurred to you when in a public street, with no soul but old Mrs. Griffinburg and a child, whe∣ther that was not a time to run away. I ask you ano∣ther thing: Did not this coach stop two or three doors from Mrs. Griffinburg's house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You then had to walk to her house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, the coach went on again.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What time of the day was this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>About two o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You then was in the public street, exceeding desireous of getting away from me, and ne∣ver thinking that was the time to run away.—What room did you go into at Mrs. Griffinburg's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>A back parlour on the ground floor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your father was not there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not Mrs. Griffinburg go down into the kitchen to give her orders about the dinner?</P>

<PB N="62" REF="010919_0061_0F8529479C9B6CE0"/>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She went down and made the door fast after her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I desire to have a plain answer, with∣out seeing so much of the consequence: I desire to know whether she did not go out of the room and go down into the kitchen, and leave you and Miss Fanny alone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serjeant Leigh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She explains every question you ask her, and if you take the answer, you must let her explain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe she might go once or twice. She went out two or three times; she always kept the door fast, and kept amusing me with accounts that my father was coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One would have thought such a young woman as you are could have got out of the parlour into the street. How many hours did you stay there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell how many.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What part of the afternoon did you set out for the Crown and Magpye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>About nine o'clock. If I had tried to es∣cape from Griffinburg's I believe I could not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What time did Mr. Morris the trades∣man come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was brought to carry the letter.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you wrote another letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did, and sent it to my father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That letter was your own letter, wrote by yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you come to the door to Mr. Morris, and give him that letter to carry to Mrs. Berry, the landlady of the house where your father lives? You speak of the boy's leading the way into the room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>How far might that tavern be from your father's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>The length of the Minories, and a little way up that street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had you never been by that house?</P>

<P>Yes. I should know it if I was to see it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And then you was afraid to attempt to get away because I had hold of your hand?</P>

<P>Yes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was any bell in the room?</P>

<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The bell was rung, and the boy went backwards and forewards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether, during the time you was there, you was not more than once left with no body but the child and the neice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: Lord Baltimore was in the room all the time; he never went out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe the tradesman came back, and went back with you in the coach to Dr. Griffin∣burg's? did he not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He got out of the coach to go to Sir John Fielding's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So I afterwards understood, to see about Harvey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was not his business to fetch your fa∣ther to Dr. Griffinburg?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know any such thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One of Sir John Fielding's clerks came with a card, you said; you did not give an answer to it, but put the card in my hand, and I said you should not go; then you desired your father might come there. Recollect yourself, and tell me whether that is the ac∣count you stand by? You swore, upon receiving the card, you did not say, I will not go to Sir John Fielding's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I know of; I did not say any such thing.</P>

<P>Recollect yourself?</P>

<P>I cannot recollect that I said I would not go.</P>

<P>In giving in my evidence, I gave it in e∣very thing as far as I could recollect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether, when the card was brought to you, you did not immediately say, without putting it into my hand, that you would not go to Sir John's?</P>

<P>Can you say positively one way or other?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think you say, when the coach came back again to my house, that there was a great mob, and you called out to them, to let them come in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When did you first hear of this thing they call the Habeas Corpus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I heard the word Habeas Corpus, when they were talking in their own language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What did you understand to be the reason of your going to Lord Mansfield's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I concluded that my friends were taking some step; and that carrying me to Lord Mansfield's was something done by my friends in opposition to Lord Baltimore; but I did not know that Lord Mansfield was a magistrate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When you was first told you must go before Lord Mansfield, did not you say to me that you was satisfied, and would not leave me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, I never said so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You spoke of a letter you wrote to your father upon the occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I believe there was something remark∣able in that letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I put a little bill in it, that my fa∣ther might know it came from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This letter was wrote that day before you went to Lord Mansfield: how long before you went, had you finished this letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was just then out of my hands before. Mr. Warts came in the first time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You express in that letter the good treatment you have received from me, and desire they would make no more disturbance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I did not know what to say, in order that he might let it go. I wrote it by his order, in a manner contrary to my heart, because I was afraid he would not otherwise let it go; and because I was afraid my father would be afraid to come.</P>

<P>Yes, I did.</P>

<P>No.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. <HI>Woodcock.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I gave it Lord Baltimore, and he shew∣ed it to Brown.</P>

<P>Did you not tell my Lord Mansfield, that you knew he had no power, as you was more than of age, to oblige you to go back to your father? After having said you was taken away, and detained against your consent, you told Lord Mansfield, that you was willing as things were as they were, to go back to my house.

<P>You knew your friends had brought you there, to get you out of my hands; you was with Lord Mansfield, and only another gentleman with him; have you no better reason to give the jury for not tel∣ling him you was unwilling to go with me again, than the not knowing Lord Mansfield's authority. Now, when you was sent to your friends, did you immediately ask that question, was that the first?</P>

<P>Do you remember a woman coming to your shop for a pair of ruffles?—Do you remember one Mrs. Johnson?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and Lord Baltimore followed her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you remember his coming several times?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I was at home three times when Lord Baltimore came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was you at home when he bought some ribbons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I was not then; Mrs. Harvey came on Monday the 14th of December, and desired to know whether we had any flowered gauze; I took down the
<PB N="69" REF="010919_0068_0F85294CE569B2A0"/>book and shewed her: she bespoke a pair of double ruf∣fles, and ordered them to be done the next day by one or two o'clock. She accordingly came, and paid for them; and ordered my sister to bring some lace with her (to put on a child's cap) to Curtain-row where she said she lived. The next day my sister went, about half an hour after four o'clock; that was on Wednesday. My sister did not come home all night; we were very much frightened; we sat up till one o'clock; then a let∣ter came that she was at a friend's house; that she was safe and well. A porter brought it; it was not my sis∣ter's hand-writing. This was Wednesday the 16th of December.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>The first letter shewn her.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is it. There was no name, nor the place she was at. I asked the man who brought it, where he had it. He said he came out of Whitechapel, and then he went away. This letter said she would come home at twelve o'clock next day. I sat till that time, and was very uneasy. I then went to all her friends she used to go to, to enquire after her. The first night we had any account of her, was a week after she had been gone away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What methods did you take to get at her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>We went to see after Mrs. Harvey, but could not find the place; nobody knew such a woman. Mr. Davis came and told me he believed he had found something of it out. I went accordingly to Mrs. Har∣vey's; the maid came to the door; I asked for Mrs. Har∣vey, if she was at home. She said, no. I asked her how long she had been gone out. She said ever since that night week. I asked if any body went with her. She said a young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then from that you traced ont that Mrs. Harvey was gone out with a young woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and by the description of her dress I knew it was my sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know any thing of your own knowledge between that time and when you saw your sister at Lord Mansfield's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>We followed this Mrs. Harvey: she came to her own house on Christmas-day at night, and was taken up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There was an Habeas Corpus taken out,
<PB N="70" REF="010919_0069_0F852865186B24F8"/>and you saw your sister at Lord Mansfield's how did she appear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>She appeared almost out of her senses. We had a great piece of work to persuade her that Lord Mansfield had power to deliver her. When I went to her, I asked her if she was married. She said, no. We told her she might now get away, Lord Mansfield could deli∣ver her. We had a great piece of work to persuade her he had power to deliver her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did she express any desire of going back to Lord Baltimore's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>E. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but great desire of going with us: only she was afraid Lord Mansfield had not power to de∣liver her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did she express this more than once?</P>

<STAGE>(<HI>The first letter.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P><HI>I beg of you not to make yourself uneasy about your daugh∣ter; for she is at a friend's, and will come home about twelve o'clock to morrow morning. The reason of this is, that she could not get a coach. Otherways you may sleep secure that she is safe and well as you at home.</HI></P>

<P>I should be glad to know what you have done with the 2001.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I made no manner of use of it; I put it that night into the hands of Mr. Cay, a baker, in Whitecross-street, to keep it till we should hear from her: he has that note to shew now. On the Friday there came a Jew-like man, that sent for me and my daughter to a tavern on the other side Tower-hill (I have forgot the sign) to desire me to meet about my daugh∣ter's affairs. He said to me, this day I saw your daughter. Said I, we are in great concern to know where she is. Where did you see her? Said he, I saw her this day at Bethnal-green; but I never saw her before in my life. He promised that on the morrow following, which was Saturday, I should see my daughter between ten and three in the afternoon. He swore to it many times. If my Lord had sent me twenty bank notes it would not have satisfied me; we wanted to see my daughter. That gave us a little relief; we were in hopes till the time was expired. We heard no more about her for five or six days. We were seeking after Mrs. Harvey, and could not sind her for some time. We heard she came home on Christmas-day at night: we took all the methods we could to take her up; and we did take her up. I had one that waited in Mr. Goff's house in the
<PB N="74" REF="010919_0073_0F852869A7C86320"/>same row, to see if she could see any thing pass in Har∣vey's house. Accordingly she was taken up on the Mon∣day. On the Sunday I was told, by Mr. Davis, a per∣son that keeps her company, where she was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He intended (I think) to marry her with your approbation?</P>

<P>This friend, Mr. Cay, advised me to em∣ploy Mr. Watts to find her out. We went to Lord Mansfield's the Tuesday after we heard where she was, which was on the Sunday before. I went there; it was some time after my daughter had been there and Lord Mansfield had examined her. Then my daughter and I were together in a room.</P>
</SP>

<P>According to the best of your recollection, tell my Lord all that passed at that time between you and your daughter?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What age?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Threescore-and four. I was glad to see her; but was sorry to see her in that condition. She seemed like one that was almost bereaved of her senses at that time. She seemed to be so concerned about seeing Lord Baltimore again; for she did not know that it was in the power of Lord Mansfield to set her at li∣berty. She said that over and over to me. She said if Lord Mansfield had told her he had, she had forgot it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had either of your daughters talked to her before about Lord Mansfield's power?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Woodcock.</SPEAKER>
<P>When they saw her, then they told her, that he had it in his power to set her free. She said then she should be very glad to go with us. That was the substance of our discourse. Lord Mansfield came into us, and said, you may go where you please. Have you a mind to go with Lord Baltimore, or with your friends? Do which you please. She said she would go with her friends to be sure. He then said she had liber∣ty to go where she pleased.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Watson.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When we went to my Lord Mansfield's, the servant told us, he was not within then, but was at L. C. J. Wilmot's. The servant said he would go and ac∣quaint his Lordship that we were there. Then he went, and in a short time Lord Mansfield came in. When he came into the hall, he asked if the Habeas Corpus was served; Mr. Watts answered, it was. His Lordship then said, gentlemen, if this young lady should choose to go with Lord Baltimore, or words to that purpose, so it must be; for no person has any right to compel her to go any where against her own consent. Therefore, his Lord∣ship sid, none of us must touch her. To which somebody present said, there was no rescue intended. Lord Mansfield having said, if any of us touched her he must commit us; he then said, if she should choose to go with her father and friends, if Lord Baltimore, or any of his people, touch her, I will commit them. Lord Mansfield very condescendingly added, I give you this friendly hint that you may know how to behave. Up∣on which Lord Mansfield retired into an adjoining room, having ordered Mr. Watts to send to Lord Balti∣more, and let him know that he (Lord Mansfield) was ready. In a very short time I saw a carriage with two gentlemen and Miss Woodcock. The first gentleman walked in, and as he appeared to me, with much pre∣sence of mind: from whence I concluded it was not Lord Baltimore. The other gentleman, whom I after∣wards
<PB N="76" REF="010919_0075_0F85286B38DF5768"/>found to be Lord Baltimore, handed Miss Wood∣cock out of the carriage; when he led her up the steps into the hall, she put her hand on Mr. Potts's arm, look∣ed up in his face, shook her head, and the tears stood in her eyes. Mr. Potts lifted up his right hand, as I im∣agined, intending to lay his hand upon her's: when I pulled back his hand, and said, are you mad? recollect∣ing what Lord Mansfield had said. Several gentlemen said, do not touch her. Mr. Potts said, I did not touch her; she has laid hold of me. At this time, a servant opened a door of the room adjoining: upon which Lord Baltimore and Miss Woodcock went into that room, and the door was shut. When they had been there about three quarters of an hour, more or less, I heard a bell ring, and the door was opened. And I knew Lord Mansfield's voice when he said, is Mr. Wood∣cock the father, and Miss Woodcock the sister, there? To which it was answered from without, no, my Lord, they are not here, but just by. Upon which his Lordship ordered they should be sent for. They were sent for; and in a few minutes came Mr. Woodcock and his two daughters, when they were introduced, and the door shut after them. After they had been introduced about a quarter of an hour, or nearly that, a little more or less, the door was thrown open, and the gentlemen present that pleased, were desired to walk in. When we walked in to the room, Mr. Woodcock the father, and his three danghters, were there, and no other person that I observed. I went up to her, and said, well girl, how do you stand affected now? to go with your father and friends, or with Lord Baltimore? She answered, to go with my father and friends. I then retreated a few steps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Baker.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether any of her friends that went in with you said any thing or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Watson.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell; in a short time the door was opened, the further door, Lord Mansfield appeared and said to this purpose; Madam, is it your desire, or are you willing (I cannot swear positively to all his words, or the exact position of such of them as I do remember) are you willing to return with Lord Baltimore to his house in Southampton-Row, or to go with your father and friends? to which she answered, with my father and friends by all means. Lord Mansfield asked her, whe∣ther she had been taken or carried without her own con∣sent, and detained against her will? she answered, that
<PB N="77" REF="010919_0076_0F85286BD82A10D0"/>as she had been carried to a place which she did not then know, but found afterwards to be Lord Baltimore's, she had been kept all this time against her will. Lord Manf∣field repeated the questions, with some variation of the terms, and told her, that her going with her father and friends was not to be understood to be in custody by them, but to be at liberty as usual. After this his Lordship said to us that were present to this effect; Gentlemen, I would have you take notice of these answers, because possibly this matter may be variously talked of in public, and ju∣stice ought to be done to both parties; for when this lady came before me on her private examination, she expressed, at first, her inclination to return with Lord Baltimore, however she expressed a desire to be permit∣ted to see her father and sister, or sisters, upon which I called for her father and sisters, and now she has answer∣ed as you have heard. His Lordship then said somewhat, which I have not been able ever since to recollect, for I had attended to what he had said, when his Lordship had desired we would take notice of her answers, but his Lordship concluded with this, and I suppose gentlemen, none of you make any doubt of it. His Lordship then said, madam you are at full liberty to go where you please. His Lordship then asked Mr. Watts if the habeas corpus was regularly served? to which he answered, it was. Then his Lordship said, it was not served by any of Sir John Fielding's men was it? it was answered none of us were in any connection with them. Then said Mr. Watts I served it myself, and would not do such another job for five hundred pounds.</P>

<P>I shall stop whenever you please; she went away with her friends; after we were gone from Lord Mansfield's house I asked her, as she was going, whether it was with any reluctance that she had left Lord Balti∣more? She said, by no means, I am willing to go with my friends, I have reason to be thankful to God Almigh∣ty for this day's deliverance, I hoped in God, as he knew I was innocent, and taken away without my consent, that some time or other he would open a door for my deliverance, though I did not see how; I heard some of her friends making an appointment to dine together at a tavern, and I being under an appointment to dinner, left them; I never saw her to my knowledge before.</P>

<P>No; I and several more went with her to the De∣vil Tavern, Temple-bar, then we carried her before Sir John Fielding at eight o'clock at night, that was when we got there; I believe we staid some considerable time at the house while she dressed herself; I believe it might be past ten o'clock before we got away.</P>

<P>What was the reason for keeping Mrs. Harvey from ten in the morning till eight at night with∣out carrying her before a magistrate?</P>

<P>Having that information, what did you do?</P>

<P>They had obtained a writ for taking up Mrs. Harvey. I went, with some more friends, about eleven or twelve on Sunday morning; we could see nothing of Mrs. Harvey: we went to an adjoining house, drank something, and then they returned; that was on Sun∣day about noon.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serj. Leigh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You did not see Miss Woodcock?</P>

<P>No, not then. I went into the strand and came back again, and then I saw Miss Woodcock; I came down Southampton Row that afternoon, about four or five o'clock, and turned round to go to the Foundling hospital; at the farthest window in that front, the win∣dow next the hospital, I first saw Miss Woodcock.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serj. Leigh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How was she employed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Davis.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was standing at the window, and looking out at the window in a very pensive manner. When I first saw her, I was within a few yards of the wall that goes to the Foundling Hospital. My surprize was so great, that I could hardly believe it; I came nearer, and saw she had taken notice of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serj. Leigh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did she do any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Davis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not then. I came back from the corner of the wall, and pulled a book out of my pocket, and made signs for her to write: She shook her head, and pointed with her finger. I went back to the gate that belongs to the Duke of Bedford's; I staid there for about a mi∣nute; while I was there, she got from that window to the Venetian window in the centre of the front, she wav∣ed her hand, and then I went round to the other corner.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serj. Leigh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did she say any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Davis.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first word she said was, I can't come to you, I can't come to you. I said, How do you do? she rather waved that answer, and said, How does my father do? I answered her, he is well, and we are all well; I think
<PB N="84" REF="010919_0083_0F85287422547B90"/>the next was, Are you well? she said, I am well. I asked where Mrs. Harvey was, for I had a warrant in my pock∣et for taking her; she shook her head, and said, I don't know, I don't know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serj. Leigh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did she speak these words calmly and quietly, or in an appearance of distress and misery?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Davis.</SPEAKER>
<P>She seemed in distress and misery to the great∣est degree.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serj. Leigh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was this the only question?</P>

<P>After this, I believe you was at Lord Mansfield's, when she was brought there; do you re∣member what passed, or what was said in her presence?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Davis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Brown said in my hearing, that it was a mere joke for my friends to attempt any thing of that kind, for that she would certainly go back again with Lord Baltimore; which confused me, in the manner I stood connected with her.</P>

<P>I enquired which was the upper servant, and nearest his Lordship's person One Pireni then said, he carried and received messages; and Mr. Broughton, the steward, was with him, I believe, at that time, and the man seemed to be an upper servant: I expressed a desire to see them, and that I came to propose some∣thing greatly to the advantage of Lord Baltimore. They desired me to walk on one side; I walked down the yard, and then I addressed these persons in this manner: It is now not unknown that Miss Woodcock is at this house.</P>

<P>Come to the point when you saw my Lord Baltimore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Watts.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I had orders to come next morning, and a promise of seeing my Lord: this was between 10 and 11 o'clock. I was introduced to my Lord, and my Lord in a very genteel manner accosted me, he had been told who I was, and that I was an attorney on behalf of Miss Wood∣cock. I told him, my Lord, I wait on your Lordship, in order to acquaint you, that the friends of Miss Wood∣cock have found that she is here; but are doubtful whe∣ther she is here with or against her will, and it highly becomes your Lordship to disclose this matter; for as I find she is of age, if she is here with her will, it is not in the power of her friends, or the law itself, to release her; if she is here against her will, you cannot detain her. Upon this, my Lord acquainted me she was there with her consent, perfectly happy. My Lord retired from me a minute or two, and he came to me again, and desired me to follow him; I did, and he opened a door that introduced me into a room where was Miss Wood∣cock, and Mrs. Griffinburg, I believe; it was a person much like her. My Lord, in a polite manner, pointed
<PB N="87" REF="010919_0086_0F8528765FD0A740"/>his hand, and said, that, Sir, is the lady in question. Upon that I made her a bow, and what I am going to say now is the substance of the matter: I do not pretend, nor will I swear to the words that passed; I will tell them then as they were. On my making a bow, it is my present apprehension that she immediately was stand∣ing very near the door, ready to receive some person; I did not know that; I asked her a question: I asked her, whether she was there with her own consent. She an∣swered immediately, I am here with my free will and consent. Upon that my Lord looked upon me with a complacency, and seeming expectation that I should be satisfied: upon that I said to my Lord, (he looked to me expecting an answer, whether I was or was not satisfi∣ed,) I am not surprised that your Lordship has got temp∣tations enough to gain the approbation of this young woman. Miss Woodcock said, where is my father? I said, very near, Miss:—And my sisters?—I said, yes, they are. Said she, can I see them? I said, I do not know. Says my Lord, I shall take that as a great fa∣vour, if you will fetch the father and the sisters, that they may hear her declarations, and receive the same sa∣tissaction as you have done, Upon this I told them, I was willing to go: upon this I went out of the house. I did not serve the Habeas, but went out, and got a promise from my Lord I should come in again. I saw several friends within a few yards of Lord Baltimore's, and I told them what she said. They immediately said, they did not care what declarations she made under my Lord's roof and influence, and would not go there, unless with two friends, and so see her alone. I went to my Lord, and told him this matter: he was rather angry at it, and said it was an insult upon him; he did not see any occasion he had to satisfy any body but the father and sisters, and as to having two friends he would not agree to it, and gave this as a reason: Have I not as much reason to suspect that her father and her friends would influence her to tell another tale, as they have to suspect me? I answered, I thought if his Lordship was satisfied that the declarations she had made to me were genuine and clear, that he might even send her home, and they could not keep her from him. He told me a story of some of Sir John Fielding's men having made a riot, or something of that sort; I told him, that all that was against him was what I had in my pocket; nor do I know to this moment, how, or by what means,
<PB N="88" REF="010919_0087_0F852877175DCFC0"/>Sir John's men came to go there that night, because there was no accusation whatever. I did not know that they were there: I believe there were nobody there but ten or twelve persons with me to serve the Habeas Cor∣pus. He would not believe but I was privy to it. He took hold of me by the arm, and conducted me down stairs, and I thought was going to turn me out of doors, but this was my imagination, instead of that, he con∣ducted me into a room, through another room, and there was a man in the room standing: and then sat me down in an elbow-chair on the off-side of the fire, to the door: he set himself down on the off-side of the fire and he or∣dered the man to sit down by me, or by us. My Lord kept still angry about Sir John's men, and I endeavour∣ed to argue every thing I could for the sake of his Lordship, to discharge the girl undoubtedly. My Lord refused to submit to let the girl's father and sister, and two friends come. I then found it absolately necessary that I must serve the Habeas; I then gave it to his Lord∣ship: I said, my Lord I will, if it will oblige your Lord∣ship, I will wait upon my Lord Mansfield, and desire him to appoint a time. I went to Lord Mansfield; he appointed the time immediately. I wrote a card to Lord Baltimore, and he attended at Lord Mansfield's. My Lord, Miss Woodcock, and Mr. Brown, came in his chariot; before they returned, my Lord Mansfield came out of his study to me, and enquired if her father and sisters were there: I said not there, but very near; up∣on which my Lord ordered me to send for them: I did, and they came, and when they came were introduced to Lord Mansfield; but when Lord Mansfield thought proper, he ordered all the friends and me to come in; I went in, and, to the best of my remembrance, Lord Mansfield said, Gentlemen, I called you in, that you may hear my examination of this girl; and then he asked her, are you willing to go back with Lord Baltimore? Or are you willing and desireous to go with your father and friends? Says she, with my father and friends, my Lord. He repeated that several times, and she made the same sort of answer. My Lord then turned to us, and he said, Gentlemen, I think it my duty to acquaint you, that notwithstanding the answers you have heard to the questions I have put to this girl, upon her first ex∣amination, she did declare she was willing to go back to my Lord Baltimore's. As this matter may be talked of variously, I think it my duty to declare this; she declar∣ed
<PB N="89" REF="010919_0088_0F8528782C2CDE50"/>herself willing to go back to her father and friends, and then was discharged.</P>

<P>No, that I did not, if I had I should have applied immediately to Lord Mansfield, and not to Sir John Fielding, Mr. Brown, during the time he was in the hall at Lord Mansfield's, told me, that he fully ap∣prehended she would go back again to Lord Baltimore; and that as soon as she and Lord Baltimore were gone, they would go and bail Mrs. Harvey. I finding the dis∣appointment, and that Miss Woodcock was returning with her friends, I thought it would be no ways impro∣per that Miss Woodcock should attend at Sir John's at the time of bailing Mrs. Harvey, because she knew those facts that were only suspected before, and charg∣ed only by the oath of the sister.</P>

<P>When she came into the room, they ac∣quainted Sir John Fielding, that was Miss Woodcock: Sir John took her into a little back room; I went with her, and there Sir John interrogated her what he pleas∣ed, and out it came, to my great astonishment, the charge of a rape.</P>

<P>Was you acquainted with Miss Woodcock before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Ford.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor even heard of her name. I was sent for in consequence of the advice of Mr. Bearcrost the council, who said it was necessary for some man∣midwife to examine whether she was a virgin or not. I did examine her, both by inspecting the parts and intro∣ducing my finger. I found that the perinaeum was much shorter than, it is the opinion of the best practitioners in physic, it ought to be in virgins; on my inspecting the parts, they appeared as if they had been a good deal inflamed; though now the inflamation was subsided; the vagina was very rough, and the edges were covered with matter, and the parts were extremely sore. I gave it my opinion she was not a virgin, and had been lately lain with. There was a great deal of soreness.</P>

<P>Miss Woodcock came to my house, I do not recollect the time; a woman whose name was Harvey, was in custody at that time before me, upon a warrant granted, on an information made by her sister, Elizabeth Woodcock, relating to Sarah Woodcock's se∣duction; and that was the reason of her coming to my house, as far as I could judge.</P>

<STAGE>Lord Batlimore's defence, read by Mr. Hammersly, Lord Baltimore's Solicitor.</STAGE>
<P>My Lord, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I have put myself upon my country, in hopes that prejudice and clamour will avail nothing in this place, where it is the privilege of the meanest of the king's subjects to be presumed innocent, until his guilt has been made appear by legal evidence. I wish I could say that I had been treated abroad with the same candour. I have been loaded with obloquy, the most malignant libels have been circulated, and every other method which malice could devise, have been taken, to create general prejudice against me. I thank God, that, under such circumstances, I have had firmness and resolution enough to meet my accusers face to face, and provoke
<PB N="93" REF="010919_0092_0F85287C95550B58"/>an enquiry into my conduct. <HI>Hic murus ahaeneus este— nil cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire sibi.</HI> The charge against me, and against these poor people, who are involved with me, because they might otherwise have been just witnesses of my innocence, is in its nature very easy to be made, and hard to be disproved. The accuser has the advantage of supporting it by a direct and positive oath; the de∣fence can only be collected from circumstances.</P>
<P>My defence is composed then of a variety of circum∣stances; all tending to shew the falsity of this charge, the absurdity of it, the improbability that it could be true. It will be laid before the jury under the direc∣tion of my counsel; and I have the confidence of an innocent man, that it will be manifest to your Lordship, the jury, and the whole world, that the story told by this woman is a perversion of truth in every particular. What could induce her to make such a charge I can only suspect: very soon after she came to my house, upon a representation to me that her father was distressed, I sent him a considerable sum of money; whether the ease with which that money was obtained from me might suggest the idea as a means of obtaining a larger sum of money, or whether it was thought necessary to de∣stroy me, in order establish the character of the girl to the world, I know not; but I do aver, upon the word of a man of honour, that there is no truth in any thing which has been said or sworn, of my having offered violence to this girl. I ever held such brutality in ab∣horrence. I am totally against all force; and for me to have forced this woman, considering my weak state of health and my strength, is not only a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al but a phy∣sical impossibility. She is, as to bodily health, stronger than I am. Strange opinions, upon subjects foreign to this charge, have been falsly imputed to me, to inflame this accusation. Libertine as I am represented, I hold no such opinions. Much has been said against me, that I seduced this girl from her parents: seduction is not the point of this charge; but I do assure your lordship and the jury, this part of the case has been aggravated exceedingly beyond the truth. If I have been in any degree to blame. I am sure I have sufficiently atoned for every indiscretion, which a weak attachment to this unworthy woman may have led me into, by having suf∣fered the disgrace of being exposed as a criminal at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, in the county of which my father had the honour to represent in parliament; and where I had some preten∣sions
<PB N="94" REF="010919_0093_0F85287D7B7E1A40"/>to have attained the same honour, had that sort of an active life been my object.</P>
<P>I will take up no more of your Lordship's time than to add, that if I had been conscious of the guilt now imputed to me, I could have kept myself and my fortune out of the reach of the laws of this country. I am a citizen of the world; I could have lived any where: but I love my country, and submit to its laws; resolving, that my innocence should be justified by the laws. I now, by my own voluntary act, by surrendering myself to the Count of King's Bench, stake upon the verdict of twelve men, my life, my fortune, and what is dearer to me, my honour.</P>

<P>All that they have sworn of me I am innocent of. All the while this girl was in Lord Baltimore's house she was not confined at all: she used to dress herself, and told me she was going into the country. I have lent her cloaths at different times: she did go into my room and chuse these cloaths, caps, handkerchiefs, and any thing she desired. She was at all times ready to please my Lord. After supper was done she went into the room, and she bespoke of me some water to wash her feet, and I fetched the water; she asked if the water was brought up; and it was first brought into the wrong room; and as she came out of the room she undressed herself, and I saw nobody touch her: she asked me if I had a night∣cap for her? I said no: she asked me if I had a ribbon for her cap? I said no, I have no ribbon, I have a red garter, if you will have that: she said that will not do, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be some white; she took a white tucker out of her black gown, and that she tied to her head.

I went down stairs among the workmen; I came back again: she said, I believe I am a little out of order; upon which I said, that was not material; which is all I said to Miss Woodcock, till she came to bed to me, so help me God.

After she sat had down, and seemed composed, Lord Mans∣field asked her at first how she came to go away from her father in this manner? she said that she begged to be ex∣cused from giving an account of that, she would tell that to her father alone: my Lord Mansfield said, he did not want to know any of her family concerns, but that he wanted to know whether she was under any constraine from Lord Baltimore, or was confined by him? she an∣swered not in the least, or words to that effect, for I had agreed to stay with him; he repeated it again several times, and she said I had agreed to stay with him, several times over. He asked he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about part of a letter, something wrote at the bottom of the letter to her father, if it was her hand writing? she said it was: he asked her about a person who had seen her from Lord Baltimore's window? she said she had seen a person whom she knew about the house, and she said that she beck∣oned to him to came to another window; accordingly, upon her meeting him at the window, he asked her if she was well? she said yes; and she said that the rea∣son why she beckoned him to come to the window was, that her father might be satisfied, and might know she was well; and that he said, then you are well, and have been well, or words to that effect, and at last asked, is all well? on which she said she turned away from the window. Lord Mansfield asked her in this kind of way I think, from the affidavit, you are of age, of five or six and twenty? she said she was; because, says he, if you was not of age I should not take your answer so easily, but I should take you away; she answered, as I am of age I know you cannot do it, my Lord; she re∣peated it several times. She had mentioned something about her father, before Lord Mansfield asked her if she would see her father; she said she should be glad to see her father and tell him she was well: he was ordered to be sent for to some neighbouring house, and she sat down about ten minutes, while her father was sent for, and said nothing. A message was brought in that the father was come into the hall, and his Lordship directed me to

<P>I was in the room while some conversation pas∣sed between them. She came and took hold of her young∣est sister and her father; and she asked them what made them so uneasy. She said she was very well off, and ve∣ry happy; and desired they would not make them∣selves uneasy—I immediately withdrew out of the room, and went to the hall where all the prosecutors friends were, and, I believe, Mr. Watts, and Mr. Brown; and I said I believed the young lady would go back to Lord Baltimore again. I took it from hearing her say so when I went first. The second time was about five minutes space; she said, what signifies my going back: all my friends will think me a whore. They said no; all her acquaintance had a good opinion of her. Upon that she turned round to me, and defired me to let Lord Mansfield know she had agreed with her friends. Then my Lord ordered all the persons into that room that were concerned in the affair. There was a young man they called a sweatheart of the young woman's; he went in

<P>I was appointed to go to Lord Baltimore; it was a Monday night the servant came to my house. I saw Miss Woodcock there. About two in the morning some body came from Lord Baltimore's to my house to desire I would be at Lord Baltimore's house; I went there about nine; I was shewn up into a room in the one pair of stairs floor; a servant went in, and he came out to me, and told me, that the night before there had been some people at his house from Justice Fielding, who had attempted or wanted to force in at his gates; I asked what could be the occasion of it; he said there was a wo∣man taken into custody for having seduced a young wo∣man, or to that effect; I said, Have you got the young woman here; he said she was in the next room. My Lord told me they said they had come with a habeas cor∣pus, and that upon that authority they had forced into his gates; I asked him if he had been served with the habeas corpus, or his servants? he said no, and that one of the persons was Mr. Watts. Miss Woodcock was in a room; I was introduced to drink coffee; she was sitting at the upper end of the room, writing. I said to my Lord, that he should get Harvey bailed, as she is taken up on your account. This young lady came running up to me with a piece of a letter in her hand, and said, Sir, I have a letter I am going to send to my father; I told her to finish it, and send it away; she said she would. I went out with my Lord into the adjoining room, and advised my Lord to bail the woman; I asked who he had to bail her; he had not, he said, any body but Mr. Broughton,
<PB N="101" REF="010919_0100_0F85288380259130"/>his house-steward, and Dr. Griffinburg; he said he would be obliged to me to go to Justice Fielding's; I did, and Justice Fielding said she was taken up for an offence, for decoying to my Lord's house a woman. I went from there back to my Lord, and told him, that bail would not be accepted then, but I must go again at two o clock. My Lord said, he had just then been served with a writ of habeas corpus; he said, he should obey this writ. Miss Woodcock came up, and asked if she must go to my Lord Mansfield, and said, I hope I cannot be taken from my Lord Baltimore; I should be glad to see my father, but no body else. Upon this I asked her her age; she said she was twenty-six; I said, I don't think that any judge or any other power can have any jurisdiction over you; says she, I am glad of that, for I was afraid I should be forced away; and she said she would go then to Lord Mansfield's immediately; she took me by the hand and jumped into the chariot, and all the way she said, Sir, are you sure I can't be taken away from my Lord? I said yes, as she was of age.</P>

Up∣on which some conversation arose between my Lord Bal∣timore and him; and Mr. Watts said, the lady's father, and sister, and several friends, wanted much to see her. My Lord asked where they were. He said, hard by. My Lord said they are welcome to come and see her, pro∣vided I have some friend or friends present: and said he had been extremely ill used the night before; that his house had been beset by a parcel of people; that they had not treated him like a gentleman, but had used him extremely ill, and forced open the gates. Mr. Watts said, what can you do with such a body of people? He said Methodists or Dissenters, I don't know which. He served the Habeas Corpus upon him from Lord Mans∣field. My Lord said, I will obey the writ immediately, and go with you; and fix the time. Upon this Mr. Watts went out of the room. I went with Lord Balti∣more up stairs into a room, where I saw the young lady: I never saw her before nor since. My Lord spoke to her, and she seemed very chearful with my Lord and laughed.</P>

<P>That was a letter I received from a gentleman a fortnight before; who sent me a letter to send to Lord Baltimore; which I did: and that day the gentleman had been to me, and said he desired to speak to his Lord∣ship, but he would not go to his house: and he desired me to let him know; it was a tall gentleman in a brown coat.</P>

<P>Did this lady say any thing to you a∣bout your having brought any letter from her father or friends?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Smith, your account is a pretty strange one; you have been acquainted with Lord Bal∣timore a good while, have you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Next May, six years, I have had the honour to know his Lordship; and have had the honour to work for his Lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What day of the month was this you drew the lady's picture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was on the 17th or 18th of December last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What brought you to Lord Baltimore's house that day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon that day he sent for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did he let you know what he wanted you for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought he had sent for me to draw a pic∣ture: and I afterwards saw the truth of it. His Lord∣ship sent often for me to draw pictures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And yet when you came there Lord Balti∣more lent you his pencil?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I was there I told him I had not got a pencil in my pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So then you was sent for to draw a picture and yet you went without your materials: how came you, to be in such a hurry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>He sent to me to come directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And so you was in such a hurry that you left your pencil in the other pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is natural for people when they change their clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What not to take the things out of their pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>The servant told me my Lord Baltimore want∣ed to see me directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and then you said, you thought that he was in a hurry; and you went and left these materi∣als at home: that is the fact, I think. Now when you came to Lord Baltimore's there was some conversation passed relating to a letter. Tell my Lord and the jury what the letter was he asked you about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>The letter I had wrote to my Lord from a gen∣tleman that had been with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What gentleman was he?</P>

<P>I don't know.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="107" REF="010919_0106_0F852889DCA13D28"/>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord told me that such a gentleman should come to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now see if I understand you. A fortnight before this my Lord told you, that a gentleman should come to you; but he did not come, but sent you a let∣ter. Did you send that letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sent it to my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then it was a letter directed to your hands —to be given to Lord Baltimore; and this you was in∣formed of a fortnight before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>This gentleman came just that day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And this was the very day the man came with the message to Lord Baltimore, and just before that this letter was brought to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, this letter was brought a fortnight before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>When was it delivered to Lord Baltimore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>The instant I had received it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then had you any further directions in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that gentleman called upon me on that ve∣ry day, about four or five o'clock in the evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cox.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did he say to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>He said, that he wanted to speak to his Lord∣ship. I asked if he would go to his Lordship? He said, he would not go, but desired me to let my Lord know he had been with me; and so I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Did you do it by message, or go to his house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sent a letter in French, that a gentleman that I did not know had been at my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now all this happened before you went to my Lord the same day, and yet you thought it was all about drawing a picture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord asked me what sort of a man he was? And the lady asked me what was the colour of his coat? I said, a brown coat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was that the only question she asked you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Cox.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Only then about the colour of the coat the man had on that called upon you that day. She said no∣thing about the size of the man, whether taller or shorter, did she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a single word.</P>

Miss Woodcock thought Justice Fielding would do no business at that time of night, and her father would probably be at home soon. We staid about half an hour. She proposed sending the letter, and leaving it there. My Lord asked her if she thought Mrs. Berry would deliver the letter? She said she would. She proposed writing a sew more lines. She opened the letter, and wrote. My Lord desired to see what she wrote. She read it to him. There were a∣bout five or six lines. I went and gave the letter to Mrs. Berry.

My Lord desired me to ask for Miss Wood∣cock's father and sister, and desire them to come to her at Dr. Griffinburg's house. When I went there, I could not find her father. I was carried directly to Sir John. He asked me, how I came to go with them? I told him Dr. Griffinburg asked me to go with a let∣ter. He called one of his clerks to write a card to Miss Woodcock, to desire her to come to him to meet her fa∣ther and friends there. I went with Mr. Lee, one of Sir John Fielding's clerks, to Dr. Griffinburg's. He deli∣vered the card to Miss Woodcock. I was rather fright∣ned by Sir John.

Mr. BARON SMYTHE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>THE prisoner at the bar, Lord Baltimore, stands in∣dicted for feloniously ravishing and carnally know∣ing Sarah Woodcock, spinster, against her will, on the 22d of December last at Epsom; against the statute which makes this offence felony: and the other two prisoners are indicted as accessaries before the fact, by feloniously and maliciously procuring, aiding and abetting Lord Baltimore, to commit the said rape, at the said time and place. To this they have pleaded Not Guilty; and you are to try if they are guilty. Before I state to you the evidence, I will mention to you two or three things: In the first place, my Lord complains of libels, and print∣ed accounts of this transaction, which have been circu∣lated. It is a most unjustifiable practice, and tends to the perversion of public justice; and therefore if you have seen any thing printed on the side of the prosecu∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix or the prisoners, I must desire you to divest your∣selves of any prejudice that such publications may have occasioned, and give your verdict only on the evidence now laid before you. Another thing I desire, is, that whichever way the verdict is given, none of the friends of any of the parties will make use of any expression of approbation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> applause, which are extremely improper and indecent in a court of justice, and I shall certainly commit any person whom I shall know to be guilty of it. The last thing I shall mention to you, is, to desire that no resentment you may feel at the manner in which she was carried to Lord Baltimore's house, may have any in∣fluence on your verdict; for however unwarrantable the manner was, in which she came into his power, if at the time he lay with her it was by her consent, he is not guilty of the offence of which he is indicted; though it was proper to be given in evidence in this trial, to ac∣count for her being with him, and his having an oppor∣tunity of committing the crime; and to shew, from the indirect manner of getting her to his house, the greater probability that her account is true. Having said this, I will now state to you the whole evidence as particular∣ly as I can.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="010919_0140_0F8528A958D21870"/>
<HI>Mr. Baron Smythe then stated the whole of the evidence to the jury, as before given, which took up three hours, and on account of the length of it is not repeated here; and then con∣cluded,</HI></P>
<P>In point of law, the fact is fully proved on my Lord and the other two prisoners, if you believe the evidence of Sarah Woodcock. It is a crime which in its nature can only be proved by the woman on whom it is commit∣ted; for she only can tell whether she consented or no; it is, as my Lord observes, very easy to be made, and hard to be disproved; and the desence can only be col∣lected from circumstances; from these you must judge whether her evidence is or is not to be believed. Lord Hale, in his history of the pleas of the crown
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 632, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>, lays down two rules: I. If complaint is not made soon after the injury is supposed to be received; 2. If it is not follow∣ed by a recent prosecution; a strong presumption arises that the complaint is malicious. She has owned the in∣jury was received December 21st, and the complaint was not made till December 29th; but she has accounted for it in the manner you have heard. The strong part of the case, on behalf of the prisoners, is, her not complain∣ing when she was at Lord Mansfield's, the supreme ma∣gistrate in the kingdom in criminal matters: you have heard how she has explained and accounted for her con∣duct in that particular, which you will judge of. Upon the whole, if you believe that she made the discovery as soon as she knew she had an opportunity of doing it, and that her account is true, you will find all the prisoners guilty; if you believe that the did not make the discovery as soon as she had an opportunity, and from thence, or other circumstances, are not satisfied her account is true, you will find them all not guilty; for if he is not guilty, they cannot be so; for they cannot be accessary to a crime which was never committed.</P>
