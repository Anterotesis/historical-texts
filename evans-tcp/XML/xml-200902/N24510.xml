<LG>
<L>LADIES, perhaps you've heard of Gyges' ring,</L>
<L>Of which historians write, and poets sing:</L>
<L>Form'd by a Lydian sage with potent spell,</L>
<L>This ring its wearer made invisible.</L>
<L>After his death it often chang'd its master,</L>
<L>At length fate destin'd it to Zoroaster.</L>
<L>By his successors carefully possest,</L>
<L>Long did the Magi flourish in the east;</L>
<L>'Till Ammon's son with Thais thither came,</L>
<L>Who fir'd Persepolis to please the dame.</L>
<L>Beneath its ruins long the treasure lay,</L>
<L>'Till by an Arab robber brought to day.</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="032439_0032_0FF26451F54EBA80"/>
Unconscious of the prize, he trudg'd along,</L>
<L>And sold it to a Bramin for a song.</L>
<L>Thence in Bengal thro' various hands it past,</L>
<L>And to a kinsman of my own at last:</L>
<L>He dying, gave it me, its virtues rare</L>
<L>Unfolded, and soon left a joyful heir:</L>
<L>To pass where'er I pleas'd, unseen and free,</L>
<L>O what a feast for curiosity!</L>
<L>No more shall Masonry, I cried, con∣ceal</L>
<L>Its mysteries; all its secrets I'll unveil.</L>
<L>No more the Fair shall languish; I'll explain</L>
<L>What they all wish to know, and wish in vain.</L>
<L>I said, and clapp'd my ring upon my fin∣ger,</L>
<L>A way I went in haste; I did not linger;</L>
<L>A <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Brother's back, close as his shade</L>

<L><HI>Friendship,</HI> on wing ethereal, flying round,</L>

<L>There <HI>Charity,</HI> which sooths the widow's sigh,</L>
<L>And wipes the dew-drop from the orphan's eye.</L>
<L>There stood <HI>Benevolence,</HI> whose large embrace</L>
<L>Uncircumscrib'd, took in the human race;</L>
<L>She saw each narrow tie, each private end</L>
<L>Indignant—Virtue's universal friend,</L>
<L>Scorning each frantic zealot, bigot fool,</L>
<L>She stamp'd on every breast her golden rule.</L>
<L>And tho' the doors are barr'd 'gainst you, ye Fair,</L>
<L>Your darling representative was there,</L>

Sweet <HI>Modesty</HI>—Amid the moral lay,</L>
<L>To you her tribute did remembrance pay.</L>
<L>I saw each horest heart with transport flow,</L>
<L>I saw each honest cheek with rapture glow.</L>
<L>These little absences I found would prove</L>
<L>But added fuel to the torch of love.</L>
<L>Smit with delight, at once reveal'd I stood,</L>
<L>And begg'd admission of the brotherhood.</L>
<L>They kindly heard, and pardon'd my offence,</L>
<L>I barter'd curiosity for sense.</L>
<L>My magic ring destroy'd, reduc'd to dust,</L>
<L>Taught what was right, and generous, and just.</L>
<L>For Masonry, tho' hid from prying eyes,</L>

And brought me long e'er break of day,</L>
<L>To Sol's bright temple door;</L>
<L>Where there we both admittance found,</L>
<L>By power of magic, spells and sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The curber of my bold attempt,</L>
<L>Did then my breast alarm;</L>
<L>And hinted I was not exempt,</L>
<L>If rash, from double harm;</L>
<L>Which quickly stopt my rising pride,</L>
<L>And made me trust more to my guide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In solemn pace I was led up,</L>
<L>And pass'd thro' the bright dome,</L>
<L>But soon I was oblig'd to stop,</L>
<L>Till I myself made known;</L>
<L>Then round an ancient form was bro't,</L>
<L>To obtain the favour that I sought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With humble posture and due form,</L>
<L>I listen'd with good will;</L>

<L>Women should from their secrets be debarr'd.</L>

<L>Important business which they should conceal,</L>
<L>That beauteous ladies by their sparks ador'd,</L>

<L>Upon my knees I wept and toar my hair:</L>

<L>Ye maried ladies, 'tis a happy life,</L>

<L>He must some dreadful operation bear;</L>

<L>Nay, came improv'd, for on his face appear'd</L>
<L>A plealing smile that every scruple clear'd</L>
