<P>In this <HI>verse,</HI> we have the beginning of
<PB N="3" REF="001584_0004_0FB3D640D3333CC8"/>Christs answer to <HI>Peter,</HI> Where first, he pro∣nounceth him blessed. Sometimes men are called blessed, because some special blessing is bestowed on them, or shall be bestowed upon them. Psal. 41.1. <HI>Blessed is he that considereth the Poor.</HI> Psal. 84.4. <HI>Blessed are they that dwell in thy house.</HI> Sometimes they are called bles∣sed, because they are heirs of blessedness; Matt. 25.34. <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c. Thus <HI>Peter</HI> was a blessed man. Secondly, The reason why Christ pro∣nounces him Blessed, from the way wherein this was revealed to him. (1.) Negatively, <HI>Not by flesh and blood;</HI> by flesh and blood we are to understand Mortal man. Gal. 1.16. <HI>I conferred not with flesh &amp; blood.</HI> 1 Cor. 15.50. <HI>Flesh &amp; blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. Peter</HI> was told of this first by man. Joh. 1.40, 41. <HI>Andrew</HI> saith to him, <HI>We have found the Messi∣as;</HI> but the meaning is, it was not only revealed by flesh and blood. (2.) Positively, <HI>But my Father that is in Heaven.</HI> This is not to be understood of the conviction by Miracles, for many saw Christ's Miracles that were not happy, but of the conviction by the Spirit of God. God who dwelleth in Heaven had taught him this.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>Those Men are blessed, to whom the Divinity of Jesus of Nazereth is revealed, not by flesh and blood, but by the Father that is in Heaven.</Q>
<P>The Divinity of the <HI>Messiah</HI> is abundantly taught in the Old Testament: That the Fa∣ther hath begotten Him, <HI>Psal</HI> 27. That he is <HI>Davids</HI> Lord, <HI>Psal</HI> 110.1. That He is the Mighty God, and the Everlasting Father, <HI>Isai.</HI> 9 6. That He is Jehovah our Righteousness, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3 36. That His goings forth have been from of old, from Everlasting, <HI>Mic.</HI> 5.2. That He was the Man that was Gods Fellow, <HI>Zech.</HI> 13.7. And this is abundantly declared in the New Testament, That Jesus of Nazereth is the Son of God: He Himself gave witness to it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 9.37. And He accepted of that con∣fession from others: from <HI>Nathanael, Joh.</HI> 1.49, 50. from <HI>Peter</HI> in the Text; from <HI>Thomas, Joh.</HI> 20 28, 29. And it is abundantly witnes∣sed unto by inspired men: so by <HI>John</HI> the Bap∣tist, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.29. so by the Apostles in their Wri∣tings: this we all acknowledge. But there be a Number of men to whom this is revea∣led
<PB N="5" REF="001584_0006_0FB3D643D2778618"/>by the Father that is in Heaven, and those are blessed men. They are of divers quali∣ties and degrees; but what-ever their enjoy∣ments be, what-ever their calamities, their in∣firmities, their temptations, their iniquities be, they are blessed Men. If this has been revealed by God to them, they shall partake in Glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ. If God have revealed the glory of Christ to them, Glory shall be revealed in them, if they par∣take of this light they shall partake of the In∣heritance of the Saints in light.</P>
<P>Three <HI>Propositions</HI> are here to be spoken to.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>It is a difficult thing to be indeed convinced that Jesus of Nazereth is God.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> deny this, and so do the <HI>Socinians</HI> in the sense that the Scriptures teach it. It is easy to be convinced of some truths, because sense and reason do teach them: but this is a thing known purely by revelation: Natural reason makes no discovery of it, and carnal reason has many objections against it. Men are naturally blind, and the Devil by carnal rea∣sonings makes them more blind, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4 4.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a seeming impossibility in it.</HI> There is an infinite distance between God and
<PB N="6" REF="001584_0007_0FB3D645557C55F0"/>Man, and that they should be United in One is beyond our comprehension. That God should be Man and Man should be God, seem to imply a contradiction. There is a seeming necessity that if there be two Natures in Christ, there must also be two Persons, and that if there be but One Person, there is likewise but one Nature. It is absolutely impossible that the divine Nature should be an humane Na∣ture, or that the humane Nature should be a divine Nature. And it seems impossible that the same Person should be both God and Man. Hence there arose so many Heresies in the Pri∣mitive Church. The <HI>Manichees</HI> and <HI>Arians</HI> denyed the Divine Nature of Christ: some of them said, He was a meer Man. The <HI>Mar∣cionites</HI> denyed the Humane Nature of Christ, they said He only appeared in an humane Shape, as in the time of the Old Testament: and as the Angels did often appear. The <HI>Eu∣tychians</HI> denyed Him to be distinct God and Man, they confounded the two Natures, said He had one Nature made of a Divine and Hu∣mane. Many Men have been confounded to conceive, That the Natures are distinct and yet the Person the same. And the <HI>Socinians</HI> at this day, though they acknowledge that
<PB N="7" REF="001584_0008_0FB3D646D148BA78"/>Christ is God, yet do deny that He is the E∣ternal and Increated God. <HI>Nestorius</HI> taught that Christ was two Persons.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is seeming improbability in it.</HI> If it be granted that 'tis not impossible, yet it seems improbable.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It seems improbable that God would so condescend.</HI> It is condescention for God to have any Communion with Men. It was con∣descention for God to appear to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to be familiar with <HI>Moses.</HI> Man is but a worm, <HI>Job</HI> 25 6. And it must needs be great condescention for God to be made flesh; to be manifested in flesh. It would be matter of admiration, if a Prince should Marry a Poor Woman: but this is more, God must stoop very low to do this: this was too much to ex∣pect, before it was revealed: It would have been impudence to have asked it of God. The Angels of Heaven did not imagine such a thing, if it had been proposed to them, they would have thought, that it had been too much. God has shewed a great deal of kind∣ness to the holy Angels, but there is nothing parallel to this. It seems as if it would be an undervaluing, and forgetting his own Superi∣ority. It seems very unlikely that He would
<PB N="8" REF="001584_0009_0FB3D6485266C120"/>take upon him a Nature made out of the dust, that is exalted but one degree above the beasts. A Nature compassed about with In∣firmities, a Nature inferiour to the Angels, a Nature liable to hunger and thirst, and weari∣ness, and pain, and death. It seems as if it were too much for love to do: That He would disdain to appear on earth in a mean outward appearance: That it should be said when He appeared in the form of a Servant, That this is God, This is He that you are to Worship and Adore.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It seems improbable that He should be wil∣ling so to advance Jesus of Nazereth.</HI> It was a great thing that He should advance <HI>David</HI> from being a Shepherd to Rule His People Israel: he says, <HI>What am I, and what is my Fa∣thers house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.18. It is a greater, that God is wil∣ling to advance any of Mankind to heavenly glory, He puts great honour upon them there∣in. But this is more, that it should be said of a Man, that He is God; that He made Heaven and Earth, that out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings God should ordain Strength, that He should advance a Man above Principalites and Powers, and say of him, <HI>Let all the Angels
<PB N="9" REF="001584_0010_0FB3D649D193B5C8"/>of God worship Him,</HI> and say to Him, <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</HI> It seems to be too much for a Creature to be Personal∣ly United to the Creator. God is angry with us when we Worship Wood and Stone, and Silver and Gold; and it seems very unlikely that God should bid us Worship One that was made out of the dust, as well as our selves. The honour that God puts on many men in the World is very great, but it is amazing that God should put so much honour upon a Man, that He should be Personally United to the Divine Nature: that the God of Heaven and Earth, whom all the Angels adore, should take the Son of a poor Woman, Married to a Man of mean occupation, into Personal Union with Himself.</P>
<P>PROP. II <HI>Yet many Men have some Per∣swasion of it, because it is revealed by Men.</HI> There be Multitudes of Men that make a Profession of his Divinity, that are but carnal men: for they are not obedient to him: <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.46. <HI>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say.</HI> They are zealous in the Profession of his Divinity, they Write in de∣fence of it, they suffer Persecution for it. If any Man among us should deny it, they would
<PB N="10" REF="001584_0011_0FB3D64B53772780"/>think he were not worthy to live; they have a considerable perswasion of the Truth of it, but it is because it is revealed by Man.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because it is acknowledged by such a Mul∣titude of Men.</HI> They have imbibed this doctrine from their Childhood: and wherever they go they find others are of the same per∣swasion; they hear that many great Nations do receive it: Wise and Learned Men are of that perswasion, and they take it for granted that it is so, and dare not call the thing into question. As the <HI>Ephesians</HI> were perswaded that the <HI>Image of Diana fell down from Heaven.</HI> And as the <HI>Turks</HI> are perswaded that <HI>Maho∣met</HI> was a great Prophet. And as the carnal Jews were perswaded that God spake by <HI>Mo∣ses:</HI> so these men are perswaded that Jesus is the Son of God: They think surely so many wise men in former Generations, and in this Generation are not deceived. They don't think it strange that Ignorant Heathens should be deceived, and that the Jews that are under great Prejudices should be deceived. But they dare not harbour a thought, that such good and wise and learned Men as make this Profession should be deceived. The restimo∣ny of the Christian World is of great force
<PB N="11" REF="001584_0012_0FB3D64CD51F0B20"/>with them, they say it is not to be imagined that such Men would agree in such a Professi∣on without ground. If there were but few that owned it, that would be a terrible temp∣tation to them, but it would be unreasonable for them to question that which is so generally acknowledged, they should render themselves abominable, and be contemptible and vile in the Eyes of all about them, and make their lives miserable, if they should give way to a Scrupulous Spirit about this doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because there are so many arguments for it in that book, which Men say is the word of God.</HI> There are many reasons drawn from the Scriptures to prove that Jesus was the Son of God. It was fore-told, that the <HI>Messiah</HI> must come before the Scepter departed from <HI>Judah</HI> That he must come while the Second Temple was standing; that he must come before <HI>Da∣niels</HI> Seventy Weeks were run out; and there never was any yet in the World to whom the Characters of the <HI>Messiah</HI> did in any probabi∣lity belong, but only Jesus of Nazereth. The Miraculous conception of Christ is a great evi∣dence for him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.35. The Voice of God from Heaven was very evidential of His Di∣vinity. The testimony of <HI>John</HI> the Baptist
<PB N="12" REF="001584_0013_0FB3D64E51A05828"/>has a great deal of argument in it. The Mi∣raculous works that were wrought by him, and by the Apostles in his Name, are very speaking arguments. God bore witness to him by divers signs and wonders &amp; miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.4. The Resurrection of Jesus on the third day accor∣ding to his Prediction, is a great Witness for him. The rejection of the Jews soon after their Crucifying him, is a strong confirmation of this doctrine: These things are plainly held forth in the Scripture, and it is generally acknowledged that the Scripture is the word of God. The inlightned part of the World are generally of a mind, that the Scripture was given by inspiration from God. Men would count them out of their Wits, if they should not own the Scriptures to be the word of God. They think they must yield that, not only Orthodox Churches do own it, out the very Papists, &amp; many other Hereticks do. What-ever differences there are among <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen about the Explication of Scripture, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey generally agree about the Divine Autho∣rity of it; and if that be indeed the word of God, then surely Jesus of Nazereth is the Son of God.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001584_0014_0FB3D64FD16C7EB8"/>
PROP. III. <HI>They are blessed to whom this is revealed by the Father.</HI> The World doth admire the felicity of those that are great and noble, but these Men that the Father hath re∣vealed Christ unto, are indeed blessed, these are objects of Gods love, these are the heirs of the Kingdom of God. Death will put a Pe∣riod to the imaginary happiness of some men: but if men have this revealed to them by the Father, at Death they will enter into happi∣ness: for every such man doth believe on Je∣sus Christ. Some men complain that they cannot come to Christ; but these men are able to come to Christ, and do come to Him. They do fulfill the condition of the Covenant of Grace, <HI>Job.</HI> 6.45.</P>
<P>Argu. 1. <HI>Those to whom this is revealed by the Father, are convinced of the sufficiency of his Death for Redemption.</HI> When awakned Sin∣ners are invited unto Christ, they are not con∣vinced of the sufficiency of the blood of Christ, and they are afraid to accept of the Invitation. They consider that their Sins have been very great, and God is an Holy and a Jealous God: That he hath threatned ever∣lasting destruction for Sin, and that the suffe∣rings
<PB N="14" REF="001584_0015_0FB3D65154779BD8"/>of Jesus Christ were but for a few years, and the extremity of them for a few hours; and don't see the redeeming virtue of his blood. They could as quietly depend upon the Sacrifices of <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Oxen,</HI> as the Sacri∣fice of CHRIST: They can take more in∣couragement from the Tears that they shed, than the blood that Christ has shed. But when they are taught of the Father the Divi∣nity of Christ, they are convinced of the suffi∣ciency of his Death: when the Father doth teach them the Divinity of Christ, then they do indeed see his Divine Glory; than they say, <HI>God has purchased his Church with his own blood,</HI> Act. 20.28. Then they say, <HI>The blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, doth purge the Con∣science from dead works,</HI> Heb. 9.14. They have such a sense of the dignity of his Person, that they are satisfied that his sufferings are a suffi∣cient price of Redemption. That though his sufferings were but for a little time, yet they abundantly answer for those Eternal Punish∣ments that they have deserved. That God has received a full recompence for the wrongs which they have done him: now they cannot count the blood of the Covenant a common
<PB N="15" REF="001584_0016_0FB3D652EC362168"/>thing. They say, <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse, being made a curse for us.</HI> Gal. 3.13. They can have no low thoughts of the Sacrifice of Christ; they say it was the Mighty God that Suffered, He whose goings forth have been from Everlasting, He whose Glory fills Heaven and Earth, He who is the bright∣ness of his Fathers Glory, and the express Image of his Person.</P>
<P>Argu. 2. <HI>They are convinced of the Divinity of Gospel Invitations.</HI> Awakened Sinners are not satisfied in the divine authority of the Gospel call: They know that the Minister Invites them, and they know not but that the Gospel calls are Gods calls, and they are in∣clined to think that the Gospel is the Word of God. But when God opens their Eyes and shews them the Divinity of Christ, He always at the same time convinceth them of the di∣vine authority of the Gospel: When they are taught by the Father that Jesus is the Son of God, they see at the same time, that all that doctrine which is taught in the Gospel is di∣vine, they see that the sending of Christ into the World, was the Work of God, that the Command to believe, is Gods Command, and the Promise made to believing, is Gods Pro∣mise;
<PB N="16" REF="001584_0017_0FB3D65453105B18"/>and so the Word comes with mighty power upon their hearts. 1 Thes. 2.13. <HI>When we received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of Man, but as it is indeed the word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe.</HI> Before they were at a loss whether the Word was the word of God, and they thought in case it should be so, that God might not intend them, God might be willing to Save others, but not wil∣ling to Save them; but now when God opens the Eyes of Men, they are at no loss about the Invitation, they hear the Voice of God calling them, and so they are not afraid to come to Christ. Before they were afraid it would be Presumption, they feared they should be more bold than welcome, they feared that it would be a provocation for such as they to obtrude themselves on Christ. But when God reveals to them the divine Glory of Jesus of Nazareth, they are at no loss about their liberty to come to Christ: They see their Warrant, and no∣thing will scare them from coming to Christ, if their offences had been more, if every Sin were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, they would come. Joh. 6.45. <HI>Every one that hath heard &amp; learned of the Father cometh unto Me.</HI></P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="17" REF="001584_0018_0FB3D655D172C430"/>
<P>USE, I. <HI>Hence it follows, That Men dont know who are blessed.</HI> If Riches &amp; Dignities, or Morality, or Baptism, or Church fellowship would make men blessed; we might be able to pronounce many men so: But if it depends on the Fathers revealing Christ to men, then we are under an uncertainty. Christ knew that the Father had revealed him to <HI>Peter,</HI> but we don't know who he hath revealed him unto. It is difficult for some good men to know it concerning themselves, but much more difficult to know it concerning others. We may have grounds of strong perswasion concerning some; but we must not pretend to an infallible knowledge respecting any o∣ther men.</P>
<P>Consider, 1. <HI>If Men profess the Divinity of Jesus Christ, we dont know that it hath been re∣vealed to them by the Father.</HI> There be a Multitude of People in the World that make a Profession of this, and they do it seriously and zealously; but they be but sew that have this revealed by the Father. Tradition and rational conviction, are the foundation of ma∣ny mens Profession: for indeed there are but few that are taught of God Matth. 20.16. <HI>Many</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="001584_0019_0FB3D658EACCDD08"/><HI>are called and few are chosen.</HI> Christ charges some that make a Profession, with Spiritual blindness. Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> And many men that make a great Profession, are destitute of Saving Grace. The foolish Vir∣gins had no oyl in their vessels: Some that have a Name to live are dead. All that are taught by the Father will make a Profession of Christ: but there be many that make that Profession, that are not taught by the Father. There is a great difference between the visible Church and the invisible. Multitudes will be rejected at the last day, that made a great Pro∣fession. Matth. 7.22, 23. <HI>Many shall say to me, have we not prophesied in thy Name,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And then I will profess unto them, I know you not, ae∣part from me ye that work iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If Men tell that they had a very affecting discovery of Christ, we dont know that it is any more than common Illumination.</HI> Many men have great illuminations that are never Con∣verted: Natural Conscience is capable of a great deal of light; a Natural man may have an affecting discovery of hell. <HI>Isai</HI> 33.14. They say, <HI>Who can dwell with devouring fire? who can dwell with everlasting burnings?</HI> He may
<PB N="19" REF="001584_0020_0FB3D65A52F8F6D0"/>have an affecting discovery of Heaven: So we find when Christ had been speaking of the Resurrection of the just, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.15. One that heard him, said, <HI>Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.</HI> So he may have an affecting discovery of Christ, and of the Gos∣pel. They may hear the word &amp; anon with joy receive it, <HI>Math.</HI> 13.20. They may be so affected, as to look upon the doctrine of the Gospel to be a blessed doctrine, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.15. They may be inlightned and taste the good word of God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6 4, 5. Common illumi∣nations, may beget as strong affections as Spi∣ritual illuminations, Men may be much af∣fected with Christ, yet not be convinced of his divine Glory: in the days of his flesh ma∣ny had such a perswasion as is called faith, yet it was not faith of the right kind. <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.23, 24. <HI>Many believed on his Name, but Jesus did not commit himself to them; because he knew all men.</HI> So <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.42, 43.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If they tell us that immediately upon that discovery they came to Christ, we cant tell but that they were mistaken.</HI> Many men will give that account that upon the coming of some Gospel Promise to them, and a discovery therein of the Alsufficiency of Christ, they
<PB N="20" REF="001584_0021_0FB3D65BD1B81A30"/>cast themselves upon him: And generally we have reason to believe that they speak the truth in their heart: But how can we tell that they are not mistaken? for many men take that for coming to Christ that is not coming to him. There be images of faith, as well as of other graces Jam 2.14. <HI>What doth it pro∣fit, if a man say he hath faith?</HI> Some hope that Christ will Save them, and they call that faith. Some depend partly upon the Righteousness of Christ, and partly upon their own works, and they think they believe in Christ. Some men dont rightly understand the nature of faith, they have had experience of those work∣ings that they call faith: and some dont un∣derstand the actings of their own Souls; they can give a right discription of faith, but they greatly mistake in the application of it to themselves: There was something like faith, and they hope it was faith.</P>

<HEAD>USE, II. Of EXAMINATION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Whether you have been taught the Divinity of Jesus by the Father that is in Heaven.</HI> You make a Profession of the divinity of Jesus, but this dont make you blessed. There are two
<PB N="21" REF="001584_0022_0FB3D65D518AE7E0"/>sorts of Persons that make this Profession, some have only been taught it by flesh and blood; they are far from being blessed: and there be some to whom this is revealed by the Father; that is it that makes men blessed. If you be not more happy than many Persons that make a Profession of Christ; if you be not more happy than many Persons that are zealous in the Profession of Christ; if you be not more happy than many Persons that walk outwardly according to that Profession, you are far enough from blessedness. You say it was by the good Providence of God, that Christ was revealed to you. So all things come to pass by the Providence of God: but this you must inquire into, <HI>Whether God by his Spirit hath indeed taught you the Divinity of Jesus Christ!</HI> For if you do not know this, you dont know that you are Godly, you dont know that your Sins are Pardoned, you dont know what will become of you when you die: therefore examine this matter.</P>
<P>Two things make this Examination diffi∣cult.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some men that have not been taught by the Father, have had great illuminations</HI> Some men have been satisfied at the time that the
<PB N="22" REF="001584_0023_0FB3D65ED2F39000"/>Sun of Righteousness has risen upon them with healing in his Wings: But afterwards they have considered that <HI>Balaam</HI> had great illuminations; that those who say they Pro∣phesyed in Christs Name, and in his Name had cast out Devils, and those that cryed, <HI>Hosanna to the Son of David, Hosanna in the Highest,</HI> must needs be much inlightned: They are at a stand what to think of themselves: they are at a loss what difference there is between their illuminations, and those which some car∣nal men have had: it seems hard to determine, that the light which they have received, has transcended the light that others have had: Others have had great confidence as well as they, others have been greatly affected as well as they, others have escaped the Pollutions of the World as well as they: They are at a loss to find out any thing peculiar and distinguish∣ing: They were not troubled with any doub∣tings at first, but they forget in time, and cant tell exactly how things were with them; and are afraid that they have had no more than some Hypocrites have attained unto.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some that have been taught by the Father, have had but a small degree of light.</HI> There are divers degrees of light: The light that
<PB N="23" REF="001584_0024_0FB3D660515D2508"/>some have is like the Morning light. The light that others have is like that at noon day: The light that some men have is very clear, things are made exceeding evident to them. The light is more explicite and distinct than in others; they have a larger and fuller dis∣covery of the Glory of Christ: yea the light that some have is more frequently repeated: They have many times had discoveries of Christ: And these men that have but a small degree of light, are under great disadvantage, because the light is small, they cannot give so distinct account of what they see; it is not so easy to distinguish that light from common light; and besides they are under great temp∣tation to suspect the revelation that is made to them. They hear other Christians speak∣ing of their experiences, and they tell what discoveries they had, and with what wonder∣ful comfort and joy their hearts were filled: and this proves a great exercise to them. They doubt whether the discoveries that they had, were any thing more than common, be∣cause they sell short of what some other Saints have.</P>
<P>Signs are,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="001584_0025_0FB3D661D17957C8"/>
1. <HI>Such as have been taught by the Father, have seen themselves utterly blind, just before that revelation.</HI> Christ Jesus came into the World, that they which see not might see, <HI>Joh.</HI> 19.39. Every man is blind by Nature, and he shews them this blindness just before he puts this light into them. Some men say, They were never at any loss about the divini∣ty of Jesus of Nazareth, they always believed it; they may be assured that it hath never been revealed to them by the Father. Some others say, They have many times seen their blindness; truly there be partial convictions of it very frequently, and yet men remain blind. But it is the manner of God just before he lets in this heavenly light, to make a tho∣rough discovery of this natural blindness, then he gives light to them that sat in darkness, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.7, 9. He dont convince men of their blindness a Twelve month before, and suffer them to loose the sense of it, and then reveal Christ to them: but he makes them sensible that they are in Egyptian darkness, that no teaching, nor arguing, nor consideration is sufficient to inlighten them, and in this ex∣tremity God makes the Sun of Righteousness to arise on them: and they are delivered out
<PB N="25" REF="001584_0026_0FB3D663AB4141E8"/>of the Kingdom of darkness, and translated into the Kingdom of Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They see God testifying to the Divinity of Christ, in the Old Testament.</HI> There be several characters of the Messiah that are applicable to none but Jesus of Nazareth; and in the New Testament it is plainly laid down, that Jesus is the Son of God. These men have read them hundreds of times, and had a com∣mon perswasion of them; but now they see God testifying to them, their understandings are inlightned to see such a glory in the Gos∣pel, that they know it to be the word of God. It can be no other than the word of God. The declaration of the Gospel comes with a divine authority upon them; they hear the Voice of God in the Gospel: the word is not an uncertain report, but there goes a glorious light along with it: They dont look upon it to be an imagination, or a conjecture, but the true sayings of God. They are not in the dark about it, whether the Gospel be a cunningly devised fable, and an humane invention. They are not of a doubtful Mind, but they plainly see a divine signature, and the character of divine authority in it. They see in it the ma∣nifestation of the Grace and Wisdom, and
<PB N="26" REF="001584_0027_0FB3D664D14EADE8"/>Righteousness of God. 1 Thes. 2.13. <HI>Ye re∣ceived it not as the word of man, but as it is in∣deed the word of God, which worketh effectually in them that believe.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They do at the same time see all other things that are necessary, in order to their coming to Christ.</HI> In order to mens coming to Christ, they must see many other things, they must see that Jesus is appointed by God to be a Mediator, that he has born the Punishment of our iniquities: That there is Saving virtue in his blood and righteousness, that the Mercy of God is free, that they are invited by God, that God is faithful to fulfill his Pro∣mise in the Gospel. And when the divinity of Christ is revealed by the Father, they see all these things. If all impediments were not removed out of the way, they would not dare to come to Christ. Indeed the Soul in its first coming to Christ hath not the particular distinct consideration of all those things; for the work is wrought at once, as it were in the twinkling of an eye, but there is that light let into the Soul, that a man sees abundant incouragement to cast his Soul upon Christ; and is satisfied in the truth of that Evangelical doctrine, that he has been instructed in: He
<PB N="27" REF="001584_0028_0FB3D66651C2D830"/>sayes, as Joh. 6.68. <HI>Whether shall we go? thou hast the words of Eternal Life.</HI> And if any thing be suggested to him about the freeness of Gods Mercy, about the fidelity of God, a∣bout the universality of the Gospel call, he is prepared to assent to these things. The word of Salvation by Jesus Christ is cleared up so unto him, that all obsticles are taken out of the way, and he can with freedom of Spirit imbrace the call of the Gospel, and joyfully betake himself to Christ for refuge.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This revelation doth immediately made a Spiritual change in the Soul.</HI> Some of these men long before the revelation was made to them, carried it orderly, were religiously dis∣posed, were zealous against Sinful ways, had an affection for the People of God, were sorry for their Sins, strove to do duties for the glory of God, were very watchful against temptations, sometimes had great inlarge∣ments and meltings in Prayer. But upon this revelation, they have quite another Spirit than they had: Now they love God, God has their hearts: they desire the glory of God. They say with <HI>Paul, Now to the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, and only wise God, be ho∣nour and glory for ever and ever,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.17.
<PB N="18" REF="001584_0029_0FB3D667D13AC058"/>Now they have godly sorrow for their Sins; this discovery works a spirit of Repentance in them; and they say as <HI>Job,</HI> Now we <HI>abhor our selves, and repent in dust and ashes,</HI> Job 42.6. This discovery puts life into them. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.25. <HI>They hear the Voice of the Son of God and live.</HI> And though the old Spirit doth return again, and gather strength, and some∣times much prevail, yet the tokens of this change do abide in them: <HI>The spirit is lusting against the flesh,</HI> Gal. 5.17. And they have a continual warfare; and many times there be sensible workings of a Spirit of Grace, they are rejoycing in Christ, panting after God, hungring and thirsting after righteousness, loving those that are godly, longing for the inlargement of Christs Kingdom, waiting for the breathings of the Spirit, hating all the works of darkness.</P>

<HEAD>USE, III. Of WARNING.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Be not at rest till the Divinity of Jesus be Revealed to you by the Father that is in Heaven.</HI> Some men have lived all their dayes in dark∣ness, they have got literal Knowledge, and they are able to prove the Divinity of Jesus
<PB N="29" REF="001584_0030_0FB3D669521E1790"/>Christ: But they have never been taught it of God, and yet the men are not in pain, or in distress of Spirit. Some have only now and then a gird of Conscience, but ordinari∣ly it is no great burden to them, their Spirits are taken up about Meat and Drink, and Cloaths, taken up about News, and appea∣rances of outward Afflictions. But one would think you should have no rest Day or Night, till this Sun of Righteousness rise on you, with healing in his Wings. One might expect that your hearts should be as heavy as lead: and that you should be crying out with <HI>Bartimeus, Lord, that we may receive our sight!</HI> It is wonderful stupidity, not to regard this miserable condition that you are in. Give not sleep to your Eyes, nor slumber to your Eye-lids, if it be possible till you have this revelation.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If you have not this, you will surely pe∣rish.</HI> Your Salvation dont depend upon the degree of the revelation, but it doth depend upon the revelation. A man may be igno∣rant of some things without any damage. There be some other things that if he be ig∣norant of, he is exposed to some inconveni∣ence thereby; but if the Divinity of Jesus be
<PB N="30" REF="001584_0031_0FB3D66AD1A96490"/>not revealed unto you, you will perish. You think it a dreadful thing to be damned, yet thus it will be with you, if this be not re∣vealed to you. Joh. 8.24. <HI>If you believe not that I am he, you shall are in your Sins.</HI> If God dont teach you He will not save you. If you have not the light of Grace, you will not have the light of Glory. If God leaves you to darkness, you must go to outward darkness. How is it possible for you to be∣lieve on Jesus Christ, if his divine glory have not been revealed to you? Joh. 6.44. <HI>No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me, draw him.</HI> Exhortations and Warnings wont prevail without this revelation, you will not dare to come to him. Flesh and blood can never prevail with you to come to Christ. Christ was revealed to <HI>Paul</HI> before he was Converted, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.15, 16. Men must be taught of the Father, before they come to Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.45. If men hear that there is Saving virtue in the blood of Christ, that he hath redeemed us from the curse, that God is willing to bestow Salvation, upon His ac∣count, that Christ is the author of Eternal Salvation to all that obey him, that there is enough in Christ for the expiation of all their
<PB N="31" REF="001584_0032_0FB3D66C51442A80"/>Sins, if they were ten times as many as they be, they wont really believe it, till the Di∣vine glory of Christ be revealed to them. When they see Him to be God, they will easily believe that He has purchased the Church with His own blood.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A great deal may be done by you in order to this.</HI> You say men are passive in recei∣ving this revelation, not active in working of it. You abstain from vicious ways, you Read, you come to Meeting, you Pray: God is a free Agent, you cannot force Him, there is no compelling God to make this revelation to you. But yet, you can do a great deal more than you do, in order to this. You can obstain from such reasonings and methods wherein you are wont to har∣den your hearts, you are able to reform your selves more thoroughly: You may abstain from Sins of Ominion, as well as Sins of Commission: You may ponder a great deal more upon your misery, than you do. You hurry your selves in the World, and spend a great deal of time in idle Talk; and let your thoughts run upon an hundred
<PB N="32" REF="001584_0033_0FB3D66DD3193C88"/>Vanities, whereas in that time you might be Meditating upon the uncertainty of your Lives, on your Appearance before God, and the Torments of Hell, upon your loss of Time, the blindness of your Minds, the enmity that is in you to that which is good, upon the awful dispensations of God to you, that He hath not given you Eyes to see, or Ears to hear unto this day. You might be looking <HI>Backward,</HI> and take notice of your Transgressions, looking <HI>Inward,</HI> and take notice of the Plague of your own hearts, looking <HI>Forward,</HI> and take notice of the <HI>Grave,</HI> and the <HI>Bottomless Pit.</HI> You may cry mightily to God. <HI>Paul</HI> when he was blind, Prayed after another manner than he had been wont to do, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.11. Some Pray as if they asked a denial, and designed to provoke God to deny them; you can Pray with importunity; and follow God with earnest Supplications. Many men are striving earnestly for the World, they are Working, they are Riding, they are Plod∣ing, they are watching Opportunities; why can you not do so for your Souls? If men were seeking more earnestly, they
<PB N="33" REF="001584_0034_0FB3D66F902748D0"/>would have more Success. Matth. 11.12. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</HI></P>
