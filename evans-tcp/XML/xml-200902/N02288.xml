<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. THE buisy and restless Soul of Man which in all Ages has been Fruitful in <HI>Many Inventions,</HI> as it has been greatly Disserviceable to the Good and Comfort of Humane Life by the Discovery of things Pre∣judicial to it; so at the same time may we not say, has made some Compensation by the Invention of others of a Proportionable Advantage and Benefit. It were easy by a detail of some of the many Use∣ful Arts found out by Man to give Evidence of this, but it must Suffice at Present, to Instance in one only, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Art of Writing,</HI> or Expressing all Sounds, and Consequently the Conceptions of our Minds, by a <HI>Few Letters Variously Disposed or Plac'd,</HI> the Commodity or Profit of which to Man∣kin'd is so Various &amp; Extensive as not to be easily accounted for. This Art is stiled by One
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leo.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Admi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Omnium inventionum humanarum Signaculum. i. e.</HI> The Wonder or Master-piece of all Humane
<PB N="ii" REF="002722_0003_0FE61317DFF69A18"/>Inventions: And how deservedly is it so, whether we Speak with Reference to the <HI>Strangeness</HI> or the <HI>Benefit</HI> of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? How Strange is it that by the Vari∣ous Disposition of so <HI>Few Letters</HI> as Our <HI>Alphabet</HI> contains, <HI>all Sounds</HI> should be express'd, and there∣by all the Conceptions or Ideas of our Minds! And as for the <HI>Commodity</HI> of it; not to mention others, from hence it comes to pass that we are Furnish'd with so much Useful History, which bringing into our View both Persons and Things most distant from us in time and place, does greatly delight and entertain us, and at the same time Instruct or Teach and Furnish us with a main part of our most useful Knowledge.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2 In the Early Ages of the World, before this most certain way of Communicating the Knowlege of things was found out; other <HI>Medi∣ums</HI> were made use of for that end, the Principa of which seems to have been Representative <HI>Symbol,</HI> or <HI>Hieroglyphicks,</HI> which way or Method of Communication every one knows still Obtains among many <HI>Ʋnletter'd Nations</HI> in the World. But this as its very uncertain on the Account of that great Variety of <HI>Interpretations</HI> such <HI>Symbols</HI> are liable to, and as the Misconstruction o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, its reasonable to think, has been none of the least Prolisick Fountains of the <HI>Heathen Mthology,</HI> by which the Antient &amp; True Tradition of the First Ages of the World has been so much Corrupted
<PB N="iii" REF="002722_0003_0FE61317DFF69A18"/>and Alter'd, so is now out of use with such Na∣tions, as among whom the <HI>Use of Letters</HI> has been Introduced. I said above that to this we are Debtors for the useful History we are Furnish'd with: and I must observe on this Occasion that there are two ways in which those who have Oblig'd us with it, according to their different Genius and Humours, have Improv'd this Noble Invention in Composing the Historys they have put into our Hands; that some therein have Confin'd them∣selves to <HI>Poetical Numbers</HI> and <HI>Measures,</HI> others not so restricting themselves, have Written in <HI>Prose,</HI> which last in latter Ages has been the more common way. That a considerable part, especial∣ly of our more <HI>Ancient History,</HI> is delivered to us in the former of these ways, is known to most that are not Strangers to Books, a considerable part of the Writings both of the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Poets what are they but <HI>Poemata Historica?</HI> Among the former, <HI>Ovid</HI> assures us his Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k <HI>METAMOR∣PHOSEON,</HI> in part, at least is no other; when in the beginning of it he Invokes the Gods in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

Ye Gods Vouchsafe (—)</L>
<L>To further this mine Enterprise;</L>
<L>and from the World begun,</L>
<L>Grant that my Verse may to my time</L>
<L>his Course directly run.</L></Q>
<P>And whoever has read it with understanding can't but see its so.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. I cannot forbear Observing here with what Pleasure I have taken notice of the great <HI>Harmony</HI> or Agreement there is in the Account he there gives of the most <HI>Antient Things</HI> with that of the <HI>Sacred History:</HI> And that we have in that Com∣posure of his a Lively Specimen of the Truth of what the Learned Observe concerning the <HI>Writings</HI> of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> viz That they frequently give in Testimony to the Truth of the <HI>Sacred History,</HI> par∣ticularly in its Account of the Eldest Times. With what Accuracy has he given us the History of the <HI>Creatson?</HI> It looks rather like the Narrative of a Learned <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Christian</HI> than an <HI>Heathen;</HI> for be∣sides the Philosophy of it, it so well Harmonises with that of <HI>Moses,</HI> that one would be Tempted to think that either he had Convers'd with his Writings, or had the Knowlege of it convey'd to him by some Secret <HI>Cabbala,</HI> as its Affirm'd by some of <HI>Pythaegoras</HI> and <HI>Plato;</HI> or which is more probable
<PB N="v" REF="002722_0004_0FE61363B8767BA8"/>that the general Tradition of it Preserv'd in the World, tho' in many Places it was grosly dis∣guis'd and corrupted, yet in others retain'd much of its Primitive Purity. For not so much as men∣tioning the Absurd Hypothesis of the <HI>Aristotelian &amp; Epicurean Philosophers</HI> concerning the Origine of the World, like the <HI>Inspired Historian,</HI> he Ascribes it to the <HI>Divine Efficiency.</HI> Having spoken of the <HI>Chaos</HI> (differing from him in Words, not in sense) wherein the contrary, jarring Principles of all Bodies lay without Form or Order, He thus goes on—
<Q><L><HI>Hanc Deus &amp; Melior litem Natura diremit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nam Caelo terras, &amp; terris abscidit Undas,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Et liquidum spisso secrevit ab Aere Caelum,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quae postquam evolvit, Caecoque exemit Acervo,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dissociata locis concordi pace ligavit.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Thus rendred by the forementioned Author,
<Q><L>This Strife did God &amp; Nature break &amp; set in Order streight,</L>
<L>The Earth from Heaven, the Sea from Earth, He parted orderly,</L>
<L>And from the thick &amp; foggy Air, He took the lightsom Sky:</L>
<L>Which when He once unfolded had, &amp; sever'd from the Blind,</L>
<L>And clodded heap: He setting each from other did them bind—</L>
<L>In endless Friendship to Agree.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>And further,</HI> Having shewed what places the several parts of matter in that <HI>Confus'd Mass,</HI> on their Separation took, according to their respective Gravitations, as also how the terrene and more
<PB N="vi" REF="002722_0005_0FE6134D12D9E5B0"/>gross parts of it were formed into a <HI>Globe,</HI> furnished with <HI>Bays, Fountains, Pools, Lakes, Rivers, Valleys, Mountains,</HI> and various sorts of <HI>Living Creatures;</HI> as if the Inspired History had been before him.</P>
<P>He goes on;
<Q><L><HI>Sanctius his animal, mentisque capacius altae.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Deerat adhuc, &amp; quod dominari in caetera posset</HI></L>
<L><HI>Natus homo est: Sive hunc divino semine fecit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ille Opi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ex rerum, Mundi melioris Origo:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sive recens tellus, seductaque nuter ab alto</HI></L>
<L><HI>Aethere, cognati rettuebat semina caeli:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quam Satus Japeto mistam fluvialibus undis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tinxit in effigiem moderantum cuncta deorum.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Thus rendred
<Q><L>Howbeit yet of all this while, the Creature wanting was,</L>
<L>Far more Divine, of nobler Mind, which should the res'due pass</L>
<L>In depth of Knowlege, Reason, Wit and high Capacity</L>
<L>And which of all the residue should Lord and Ruler be.</L>
<L>Then either he that made the World, &amp; things in Order set</L>
<L>Of Heavenly Seed engendred Man; or else the Earth as yet</L>
<L>Young, Lusty, Fresh &amp; in her Flowers, &amp; parted from the Sky</L>
<L>But late before, the Seed thereof as yet held Inwardly</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> which <HI>Prometheus</HI> tempering <HI>strait with water of the Spring</HI></L>
<L>Did make in likeness to the Gods that Govern every thing.</L></Q></P>
<P>The like Agreement with the Sacred History, I might remark in the Account he gives us of the State of <HI>Innocence,</HI> stil'd by him the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> the <HI>Flood,</HI> &amp;c How well does his Character of the for∣mer agree with that Idea of it Divine Revelation
<PB N="vii" REF="002722_0005_0FE6134D12D9E5B0"/>has Imprinted on our Minds? And the latter he Ascribes to a Concurrence &amp; Co-operation of the same causes in Nature that <HI>Moses</HI> does. Its true he Writer in the Strain and Manner of others of his Tribe, who are wont generally to mingle a great deal of <HI>Mythology</HI> with the Truth; yet notwith∣standing how easy is it for every Intelligent Reader to trace in him the Footsteps of the Sacred Histo∣ry, particularly in its accounts of the most Early Times?</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. And may we not with equal Truth say the same of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneids? which seem to be no other than a <HI>Mythological</HI> History of the Affairs of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> or the Various Occurrences of his Life; to which <HI>Homer</HI> his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ads</HI> with others from the <HI>Greeks</HI> might be added. Its Observed by some Learned Men, that this was the most Antient way of Writing, and that <HI>Prose</HI> is only an Imitation of <HI>Poetry,</HI> and that the <HI>Grecians</HI> in particular at their first delivery from <HI>Barbarism,</HI> had all their Phy∣losophy and Instruction from the <HI>Peets,</HI> such as <HI>Orpheus, Hesiod, Parmenides, Xenophanes,</HI> &amp;c. — which seems to have Occasion'd those Lines of <HI>Horace, Cap. de Arte Poetica</HI>
<Q><L>— <HI>Fuit haec sapientia quonda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></L>
<L><HI>Publica privatis Sacernere, sacra Prosunis:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Concubitu Prohibere Vago; dare jura Maritis:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Oppida moliri: leges incidere ligno.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="viii" REF="002722_0006_0FE61327B1505BF0"/>
<HI>Sic honor &amp; nomen Divinis Vatibus atque</HI></L>
<L><HI>Carminibus venit.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The sum of which is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That in Old Time <HI>Poets</HI> were the Lights and Instructors of the World, and gave Laws to Men for their Conduct in their several Relations and Affairs of Life.</P>
<P><HI>And Finally,</HI> To this seems to agree that of <HI>Cato</HI> in his Distichs,
<Q><L><HI>Si Deus est Animus nobis ut carmina dic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI></L>
<L>If God a Spirit be as Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Teach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P N="5">§ 5. I have premis'd this in way of <HI>Apology</HI> for the manner in which this <HI>Worthy Person</HI> has given us the <HI>Ensuing History,</HI> in Composing which he has Diverted s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of his <HI>Leisure Hours.</HI> And from hence tis evident he has for a Precedent some of the most <HI>Antient History,</HI> and has trod in the steps of many of the most Eminent <HI>Sages</HI> and earliest <HI>Writers</HI> History gives us any Knowlege of, who have taken that same way to raise up Monuments to, and eternize the Names and Actions of their Admired <HI>Heroes.</HI></P>
<P N="6">§ 6. Its undoubtedly true that as the Minds of Men have a very different <HI>Cast, Disposition</HI> or <HI>Genius</HI> leading to &amp; accomplishing for very differing Im∣provements, so generally speaking, those are the most Accomplished to make a Judgment on any
<PB N="ix" REF="002722_0006_0FE61327B1505BF0"/>Performance that have by Nature a Genius Lead∣ing to and Accomplishing for the same: And it being so, and withal there being none among the <HI>whole number of Mortals</HI> less furnish'd for a Perfor∣mance of this Nature <HI>than my self,</HI> I may well be excus'd in Omitting the part of a <HI>Censor</HI> or <HI>Judge</HI> upon it, further than to say that the Intelligent Reader will herein discern an uncommon <HI>Vigour</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> considerable <HI>Reading,</HI> and see reason to say, that herein we have a <HI>Specimen</HI> what good parts cultivated with a laudable Ambition to Improve in Knowlege will do, tho' not Assisted with those Advantages of <HI>Education</HI> which some are favoured withal.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. Some there are that have remark't, That the <HI>Accomplish'd Poet</HI> and the <HI>Great Man</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seldom meeting together <HI>in one Person,</HI> Or that its rare those Powers of Mind that <HI>make</HI> the one, are found <HI>United</HI> with those that Constitute the other. And perhaps it may be a Truth which for the main holds true. For whereas what is properly call'd <HI>Wit,</HI> (which is no other than a ready Assemblage of Ideas, or a putting those together with quickness &amp; variety wherein there can be found any <HI>Congruity</HI> or <HI>Resemblance;</HI> or to speak more plain, an aptness at Metaphor and Allusion) is what, as I take it, makes the <HI>Accomplish'd Poet;</HI> exactness of Judg∣ment, or Clearness of reason (which we commonly and truly say makes <HI>the Great Man</HI>) on the other hand lies in an Ability of Mind nicely to distinguish
<PB N="x" REF="002722_0007_0FE613551DF00830"/>its Ideas the one from the other, where there is but the least difference thereby avoiding being misled by Similitude, and by Affinity to take one thing from another. And the process of the Mind in these two things being so <HI>contrary</HI> the one to the other, tis not strange if they are Powers not ever <HI>United</HI> in the same Subject, yet this notwithstand∣ing, all must say, this is not a Remark that uni∣versally and without exception will hold true; but that how contrary and inconsistent soever the pro∣cess of the mind in the exercise of these two Powers may seem to be, yet there are <HI>Instances</HI> wherein they are U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in a Wonderful Measure: And many Men in whom we find a great deal of <HI>Pleasantry</HI> or <HI>Wit,</HI> are notwithstanding very <HI>Judici∣ous</HI> and <HI>Rational.</HI> And tho' Modesty forbids me to say this of the <HI>Author,</HI> yet this I shall venture to say, <HI>viz.</HI> That whatever may be said in Commen∣dation of this Performance by the Accomplished for a Judgment upon it; yet that there will not that Honour be done him thereby, as I conceive may with a great deal of Truth and Justice other∣wise.</P>
<P>But however it be as to that, and whatever the Sentiments of the Judicious in affairs of this Nature, may be of this Composure, yet I presume all will approve of the design of it, which (as to the main of it at least,) being no other than to pay a just debt to the Memory &amp; procure due Regards to the Family of one, who not only being view'd
<PB N="xi" REF="002722_0007_0FE613551DF00830"/>in his own <HI>Personal Accomplishments</HI> was a Person of distinguishing Worth, but many ways Highly <HI>Deserv'd of the Publick,</HI> every one must Confess is Laudable, it being very Consonant to the Natural Notice of what is Good and Excellent Engraven on the Minds of all Men, as appears by the Honours done, even by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nations to their admir'd Heroes,</HI> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every one not Insensible of <HI>our Valuable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> so far forth continu'd &amp; secur'd to us under the <HI>Present Constitution</HI> Obtain'd by the <HI>Agency and Influence of this Noble Person</HI> whose Name and Praise are here Celebrated, as they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y he was a <HI>Publick Benefactor,</HI> highly Deserv'd of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and tho' Dead justly Challenges a <HI>better Regard to his Surviving Posterity</HI> than by some at least, has been pay'd to them, and that his <HI>Name</HI> is not to be mention'd without a Blessing on his Memory, so that this is but a just <HI>Tribute</HI> to it.</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. For my own part whatever Opinion some may have of me as to my Principles in <HI>Politicks,</HI> and tho' perhaps our Present <HI>Frame or Model of Government</HI> is not the best that might be, but capa∣ble of a change in some points to the better, yet can freely confess that I look upon it as an <HI>Indulgence</HI> &amp; <HI>Favour of Heaven,</HI> a just ground of <HI>Gratitude;</HI> &amp; that as its a <HI>Constitution</HI> capable of rendring us a People <HI>more Happy than we are,</HI> so that the Infelicities we Labour under in the Present Day, which truly are not few or small, are rather owing to the <HI>want of
<PB N="xii" REF="002722_0008_0FE613152D0880E0"/>a due Ʋse,</HI> or rather an <HI>Abuse</HI> of it, than <HI>the Con∣stitution it self.</HI></P>
<P N="9">§ 9. I am no Admirer of those <HI>Despotick Forms of Government</HI> which as they Obtain in some places, so are not without their Advocates in others, where the Blessings they enjoy under the good &amp; gentle Administrations of <HI>better Forms</HI> might convince them of their Folly and Teach them better. I firmly Believe that <HI>the Law of Nature</HI> knows no difference or Subordination among Men besides those of <HI>Children to their Parents</HI> and <HI>Wives to their Husbands,</HI> and that these Relations only excepted, all Men are otherwise <HI>Equal, Free</HI> &amp; <HI>Independent</HI> &amp; remain so till by <HI>Contracts,</HI> Provisions and Laws of their own they divest themselves of those <HI>Preroga∣tives:</HI> Nor is it I conceive in the Power of any Person or Persons to transfer or vest that Despotick Arbitrary Power in any other Person or Persons, which some in Authority Exercise over the Lives and Fortunes of their Subjects: for no Person can Transfer to another more Power than he has in himself, and such an ARBITRARY Power over himself or any other to Destroy his own or the Life and Property of another, is what none on Earth can lay Claim to. Worthy to be Inserted here are the Words of that Great Man Mr. <HI>Lock,</HI> who well understood the true Origine of all Law∣ful Authority, and what Powers over themselves or others, Persons by the Law of Nature &amp; Antecedent
<PB N="xiii" REF="002722_0008_0FE613152D0880E0"/>to their Entring into Society are Vested with; <Q><HI>This</HI> i e <HI>Arbitrary, Despotick Power,</HI> says he, <HI>is a Power which neither Nature gives (for it has made no such distinction between one man and another) nor Compact can convey: For man not having such an Ar∣bitrary Power over his own Life, cannot give to another such a Power over it, but its the effect of Forfeiture only, which the Aggressor makes of his own life when he puts himself into a state of War with another.</HI></Q> — And a little after, <Q><HI>And thus,</HI> says he, <HI>Captives taken in a Just and Lawful War, and such only, are subject to a despotick power which as it arises not from compact, so neither is it capable of any, but is the state of War continued.</HI></Q> Thus that man of deep Tho'ts Pag. 320, 321. And tis not to be doubted but that whatever some men (may I not say foolishly eno') have advanced for the support of the Absolute power of <HI>Supreme Rulers</HI> (taking their Notions of Civil Power probably from some mistaken texts of Scripture, &amp; general Speculations founded on some Equivocal terms, such as <HI>King, Sovereign, Supream, &amp;c</HI> Yet the true Measures of all lawful Authority, be it <HI>Supream or Subordinate,</HI> are to be taken from the nature of that <HI>Compact</HI> or Contract that is the true Origine of it, &amp; Vests it in those that wear it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: Nor is this Doctrine I think in the least Inconsistent with that that asserts the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of Civil Power; or that the <HI>Powers that be are Ordained of God,</HI> &amp; therefore Challenges <HI>Obedience to them</HI> not <HI>for Wrath meerly,</HI> but <HI>for Conscience sake.</HI></P>
<PB N="xiv" REF="002722_0009_0FE613269BF0AA08"/>
<P N="10">§ 10. I presume there are not many in this Popular, <HI>Levelling Day</HI> who will not readily Sub∣scribe this Doctrine, and more than that, who will not say that in Lawful Governments that are found∣ed in Compact, the more general Error is that <HI>too much Power is given up by the Community,</HI> and Vested in <HI>their Rulers;</HI> I am very sure among us at least, there are not many, who (Pardon me if what I say be amiss) generally speaking are a People Trained up, but too much, in <HI>Principles of Rebellion and Opposition to Government;</HI> and who as to <HI>the Constitution</HI> Obtaining among us, as Popular as it is, yet think it <HI>Defective by Error on the other Ex∣tream?</HI> Yet all this notwithstanding, certain it is Despotick Forms are not the only that are Preju∣dicial to the ends of Government, but those Erring on the other Extream are perhaps as Inconsistent with them, and of this, besides their but too often Exemplifying the Condition of <HI>Ephesus</HI> at a certain time when <HI>Paul</HI> was there, <HI>Act.</HI> 19. We need not go far from Home for Evidence. Our <HI>English Constitution</HI> at Home seems to be an Happy mean between these two Extreams, Wisely contriv'd to secure from the ill Consequents of either of them. A <HI>Constitution</HI> it is wherein as one says, Tho' the <HI>Executive Power</HI> be Lodg'd solely in the King, yet the <HI>Legislative</HI> is divided between him and his People, by which as the King has Bounds set to his Prerogative, so the People have their Privileges which Assert their Liberty. Such a <HI>Constitution</HI> it
<PB N="xv" REF="002722_0009_0FE613269BF0AA08"/>is as allows enough to a King of no Tyrannical Temper, and what is Sufficient to secure the Ends of Government, and enough to the People to Pre∣serve them from Slavery. There is <HI>Monarchy</HI> without <HI>Slavery,</HI> a <HI>Great King,</HI> and yet a <HI>Free People;</HI> such a <HI>Monarchy</HI> as has the main Advantages of an <HI>Aristocracy</HI> in the Lords, and of a <HI>Democracy</HI> in the <HI>Commons,</HI> without the Inconveniences of either. In a Word, a <HI>Model of Government</HI> so Perfect and well Adapted to the Ends of Government does it seem to be, that as the things wherein other Con∣stitutions, (and in particular <HI>Ours</HI> in this Colony) Harmonizes with it, seem to be its great Per∣fects, and those wherein it differs its great Imper∣fections, <HI>though by many Cry'd up</HI> for our Glorious Privileges.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. Perhaps what I have already Written, may have given some Exercise to the Patience of the Reader, however having <HI>put Pen to Paper,</HI> I shall Presume to detain him a little longer on a matter which as it has been the Occasion of much Debate and Contention as well as many other Evils among us, so my Tho'ts are here led to it by some Pas∣sages in the Ensuing Muse. Tis the matter of <HI>Native Right</HI> as its commonly called, or the <HI>Right the Aborigines of this Country</HI> (all or any of them) had or have <HI>to Lands</HI> in it. An Interest this is which every one knows has not wanted many Advocates among us, especially of late Years, who have en∣deavour'd
<PB N="xvi" REF="002722_0010_0FE6133719111570"/>to Advance or set it up as our only Va∣luable Title to whatever Lands are in the Country, some perhaps Acting in what they have done with a real Perswasion of this, but far the most no doubt on other Considerations.</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. For my own part, I have ever thought this a <HI>matter more Talk'd of</HI> than <HI>Ʋnderstood,</HI> and am ready to think of those who are of the above∣mention'd Opinion in this matter, that they have Drank in <HI>this Article of their Faith</HI> as perhaps they have many of the rest, without <HI>due Examination</HI> or Search into the matter.</P>
<P N="13">§ 13. I Presume we are generally Agreed there is such a thing as <HI>Native Right,</HI> to speak in the Vulgar Phraise; or a Right which the <HI>Aborigines of any Country</HI> and Consequently of this, (or some of them at least) have or had to Lands in it, I mean to <HI>particular Tract,</HI> or Parcels of it: I suppose there are few that in this Point bring them down to a Level with the <HI>Bruital Race,</HI> how Barbarous or Uncultivated soever they were: And sure I am that none will Deny it that considers that as there never was any among Mankind, even the most Barbarous but what were Capable of <HI>Impropriating Lands</HI> as well as other things, so that among the <HI>Aborigines of this Country</HI> there was that found that was Sufficient for that end. Yet notwithstanding to Assert <HI>their Right in that Extent</HI> that many do,
<PB N="xvii" REF="002722_0010_0FE6133719111570"/>and suppose it, without excepting any, to extend <HI>to all Lands</HI> in the Country, whether Cultivated by them or not; is what I never could, nor yet can see any Sufficient reason for. And though I know to countenance and give a currency to this Opinion the Authority of those Truly Worthy Men that were the first Settlers of <HI>English Colonys</HI> here, as well as that of the several Governments in the Country from the begining to this Day, is wont frequently to be alledged in Discourse by our <HI>Bigots</HI> to this Principle, who would bear us in Hand they were one and all of the same Perswasion, and accordingly accounted no Lands in the Coun∣try their own till Obtain'd of the <HI>Natives</HI> by <HI>Com∣pact</HI> or otherwise, yet for my own part I could never think so Dimunitively of them, or at least many of them as to Believe they Acted on this Principle in the Regard they shewed the <HI>Natives</HI> &amp; their Pretended Claim to the Country, by entring into Treaties with and allowing them Gratuities for the Lands, but rather that they Acted on Pru∣dential Considerations taken from their own &amp; the Natives Circumstances.</P>
<P N="14">§ 14. And as it is an undoubted Truth, that the <HI>Aborigines of this Country,</HI> some or all of them had Right to <HI>Lands</HI> in it, so is it equally certain that of what Extent soever it was it arose from one of these Two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> Either the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> or <HI>Positive Laws</HI> or Constitutions of their
<PB N="xviii" REF="002722_0011_0FE61341D6F1A840"/>own (Tacit or Express) Regulating or Determining the matter of <HI>Property,</HI> one or other of these must give them what they had. And by Consequence nothing with any certainty can be Determin'd upon the extent of the <HI>Claims or Properties</HI> of any Single Person or Number of them, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first it be determin'd what <HI>their Condition</HI> was, whether they were a Peo∣ple in the <HI>State of Nature,</HI> and so had only what the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> gave them, or had q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed that State, entred into <HI>Communities,</HI> and by <HI>Compact</HI> one with another, and Positive Constitutions of their own (Tacit or Express) had fixed <HI>the Bounds</HI> of each <HI>Community</HI> respectively and Settled or Determin'd the matter of Property in Land within themselves severally: and in case this last be found, <HI>viz.</HI> that they had entred into Communities and Perform'd those Consequent Acts, further it must be Deter∣termin'd where the Bounds of <HI>each Community</HI> re∣spectively were, and what Disposition or Settlement <HI>the Laws of each Society</HI> or Community made of the Lands within their Limits severally. These are things which perhaps few of those who have appear'd with such Heat and Zeal for the fore∣mention'd Principle, ever thought of, yet I am well assur'd there is no Intelligent Person but will readily grant that till these things are Determin'd nothing with any certainty can be Known or Re∣solv'd upon the extent of the <HI>Claim or Property</HI> of any among them, whether Single Person or Com∣munity.</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="002722_0011_0FE61341D6F1A840"/>
And because diverse Persons are of Different Sentiments in this matter, <HI>viz.</HI> What the Condition of the Persons I am now speaking of was as to this, at the time of the first Access of the <HI>English</HI> to the Country when such <HI>Large Tracts of Land</HI> are suppos'd by some to be Obtain'd of them; some being of Opinion they were a People in <HI>the State of Nature,</HI> others that they had <HI>quitted that State,</HI> entred into <HI>Communities</HI> and put on some Form of <HI>Civil Policy,</HI> &amp;c — and because as I said nothing can be Deter∣min'd as to the extent of the Right or Property of any of them without a Determination of this mat∣ter, Altho' I shall not Presume upon an <HI>Umpirage</HI> of it, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all examine each of these <HI>Hypothesis</HI> and on a Supposition of the Truth of both of them severally, shall shew what can be Determin'd upon the extent of the <HI>Rights</HI> or <HI>Properties</HI> of any of them: Which when I have done I am prone to think, that those who with such Confidence, and to the no small Harm and Injury of their Country have Appear'd on the side of the forementioned Extravagant Principle, will see they have not such Evidence of the Truth of it, as perhaps now they think they have.</P>
<P N="15">§ 15. I take it for granted &amp; think it needs no Proof, that as all men are and ever were <HI>Born Free,</HI> Equal and Independent as to <HI>Civil Subjection or Sub∣ordination,</HI> so there was a time when the <HI>State of Nature</HI> obtained in the World. As there is a wide
<PB N="xx" REF="002722_0012_0FE61357197A9D10"/>difference between <HI>Paternal Authority</HI> or Power and <HI>Civil or Political,</HI> so tho' the first has been from the Beginning and is as old as the Relation between <HI>Father and Son;</HI> yet the other is not so: But as in the beginning of the World men were few in Num∣ber, wanted not Room, having the wide World be∣fore them, had not the like Temptations to Con∣tention and Strife, nor were exposed &amp; in danger of Enemies, as since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so did not presently find a necessity of <HI>entring into Society,</HI> but continued for some time in that Free Equal, Independent State wherein they were Born, having no other Law than that of Nature, &amp; not knowing what <HI>Political Power or Authority was.</HI> And this is what is Intend∣ed by the state of Nature. How long it was in the Beginning that men continu'd in this state, before there were any instances of their Embodying into any form of <HI>Civil Policy</HI> is uncertain; Nor is it strange we are left so much in the dark, &amp; Histo∣ry is so silent in this matter, since the time was so long before <HI>the use of Letters</HI> obtained in any parts of the World: yet that such a state as this did precede that of Civil Society as the Sacred History it self seems to intimate to us in those words of Cain (Gen. 4.12. <HI>And it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y me</HI> Which seem evidently to imply this state of Nature then obtaining, and that every man then look'd on himself as having in himself right to punish the Transgressi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns of the Law of Nature) so I presume is not doubted of
<PB N="xxi" REF="002722_0012_0FE61357197A9D10"/>by many in this day, wherein I suppose it is gene∣rally received for good Doctrine, that <HI>Compact is the Origine</HI> of Government, at least as far forth, or wheresoever it was begun in Peace.

<P N="16">§ 16. This <HI>State of Nature</HI> then is a state where∣in men not having any <HI>Common, Establish'd, Positive Law</HI> (Tacit or Express) or Judicature to appeal to, with Authority to decide Controversies between them, and punish Offenders, Every man is Judge for himself, and Executioner.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="002722_0013_0FE6134D090D7588"/>
<Q><HI>Those</HI> says that Worthy Person <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Lock.</HI></NOTE> before men∣tioned, <HI>who are United into one Body, and have a Common, Establish'd Law and Judicature to Appeal to, with Authority to Decide Controversies arising between them, and Punish Offenders, are in Civil Society one with another, but those w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have no such Common Appeal, I mean on Earth, are still in the State of Nature, each being (where there is no other) Judge for Himself and Executioner.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Treatise of Government, p. 247. and afterward p. 280. accounting for the Defects of this State, he says,</P>
<P N="1">1 <Q><HI>There Wants in it an Establish'd Settled, known Law Receiv'd and Allow'd by common Consent to be the Standard of Right and Wrong, and the common Measure to Decide all Controversies arising between Men. For though the Law of Nature be Plain and Intelligible to all Rational Creatures, yet Men being byas'd by their Interest, as well as Ignorant for want of Study of it, are not apt to allow of it as a Law bind∣ing to them in the Application of it to their particu∣lar Cases.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q><HI>In the State of Nature there wants a Known, In∣different Judge with Authority to Determine all Dif∣ferences according to the Establish'd Law, for every one in that State being both Judge and Executioner of the Law of Nature, Men being partial to them∣selves, Passion and Revenge are very apt to carry
<PB N="xxiii" REF="002722_0013_0FE6134D090D7588"/>them too far, and with too much Heat in their own Cases, as well as Negligence, and Ʋnconcernedness to make them too Remiss in other Mens.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the State of Nature there often wants Power to Back and Support the Sentence when Right; and to give it due Execution, they who by any Injustice Offen'd will seldom fail where they are Able, by Force to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e good their Injustice. And such Resistance man times makes the Punishment Dangerous, and Frequently Destructive to those who Attempt it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus that great Man</P>
<P>In a Word, In this State as Men have no other Law than that of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Reason</HI> to be the Mea∣sure or Standard of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> and are with∣out any <HI>Common Superior on Earth,</HI> with Authority to decide Controversi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and a Force or Power to Execute his Sentences, to whom they might Ap∣peal when Disputes arise, so every Man has right in himself both to Judge of <HI>the Transgressions</HI> of that Law, and <HI>Punish them</HI> as far as he is Able. And from this short account of this State 'tis easie to see both what it is, and wherein it differs <HI>from a State of Civil Society,</HI> for whereas in <HI>this State</HI> men have no other Law than that <HI>of Nature,</HI> &amp; every man has in himself right to Judge of &amp; Punish the Transgressions of that Law; in that of <HI>Civil Society</HI> there are other Laws for a Measure or Standard of Right and Wrong, and this Right of Judging and Executing, is given up by every Individual into the hands of the <HI>Community:</HI> For which reason in <HI>this State</HI>
<PB N="xxiv" REF="002722_0014_0FE6133579D78690"/>all Private Judgment in any matters ceases, and the Community is <HI>Ʋmpire,</HI> and by settled stand∣ing Laws made by themselves, indifferent and the same to all Parties, and by men having Authority from the Community to Execute those Laws, de∣cides all Differences that happen between any par∣ticular Members, concerning any matter of Right, and punishes all Offences with such Penalties as the Law has Established.</P>
<P N="17">§ 17. Now on the Supposition that <HI>the Aborigines of this Country,</HI> before and at the time of the <HI>First Discovery &amp; Planting of it</HI> by the <HI>English,</HI> were in <HI>this State,</HI> and not to be considered as having put on any Form of <HI>Civil Policy,</HI> let us enquire what can be Determin'd concerning the <HI>Extent of their Rights to Lands in it:</HI> And here it must be consider'd that during the continuance <HI>of this State</HI> with any Per∣sons, though all have a Right or <HI>Claim to the Earth,</HI> as well as all other things made for the Use and Comfort of Man, by Vertue of <HI>the Grant of the most High,</HI> the Great Proprietor of the World, whereby as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> says, <HI>He has Given the Earth to the Children of Men;</HI> Yet as by that they are made but <HI>Commoners</HI> in them, and can Claim only <HI>as such,</HI> so there is I suppose but one way whereby any particular Person can begin a Property in any thing, be it <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>any thing else,</HI> exclusive of the rest of Mankind, and this is by adding to it some∣thing which is his own, for Instance his Labour,
<PB N="xxv" REF="002722_0014_0FE6133579D78690"/>which is his alone, and no one else has any Right to. Thus in this State the Law of Nature or Reason to which alone Men are Subject, and which gives them what ever they have, this Law I say makes and allows the Land a <HI>Man Tills &amp; Subdues</HI> to be his <HI>Peculiar Property:</HI> by his <HI>Labour,</HI> which is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s own, (and no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n else has any Right to) be∣stow'd upon it, he does as it were Inclose it from the Common; and that <HI>Deer,</HI> or <HI>Hare,</HI> or <HI>Fruit</HI> a Man spends his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me and Strength in the Chase and Gathering of, it allows to be his Property: he does the by take them out of that <HI>Common State</HI> whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Nature had made them. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Worthy to be Inserted here are the Words of that great Man

<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="002722_0015_0FE61308800C8708"/>
Indeed after any Portion of the Earth, or any thing else is by this means taken out of the <HI>Com∣mon State</HI> it was in before, and a Property is begun in it, this State of Nature seems to Admit of other ways of fixing a Property in the same thing or things by others; Thus in this State, that Land or other thing I began a Property in by my <HI>Labour,</HI> may become the Property of another Man, <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gift or Purchase</HI> as well as in a State of <HI>Civil Society:</HI> but Labour only seems to be the thing that begins Property, and first takes things out of their Com∣mon State. As in the begining before Men entred into Society, this was the begining of it (<HI>Cain</HI> &amp; <HI>Abel</HI> had their Right of Property, the one in <HI>the Lands he Cultivated,</HI> the other in <HI>the Flocks he kept;</HI> from their Labour spent on them) so 'tis ever since where the same <HI>State of Nature Obtains,</HI> nor can it be begun that I can see otherwise.</P>
<P N="18">§ 18. And to this voice of the Law of Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Labour in this State</HI> shall be the beginning of Property, seems well to agree the voice of God Himself in the Gift or Grant he made of the Earth, the Creatures &amp; Productions of it to Man∣kind, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.28.—Where we find that <HI>Cultivating and Subduing the Earth,</HI> and <HI>having Dominion</HI> are joyned together: Thereby assuring us that as in that Gift he then made of it in common to men, he did not design it should serve to their benefit &amp; comfort only by its <HI>Spontaneous Productions,</HI> but that
<PB N="xxvii" REF="002722_0015_0FE61308800C8708"/>it was his will that by <HI>Art and Industry</HI> in Subduing and Cultivating of it they should draw still more from it, so that this should be their <HI>Title to it</HI> at least during the continuance of <HI>that State of Nature,</HI> &amp; till by positive Constitutions of their own, the mat∣ter of property should be otherwise Determined and Settled.</P>
<P N="19">§ 19. And if this be true, as I think it is, <HI>viz.</HI> That in the beginning of the World before men entred into <HI>Society, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in all Ages and Places since</HI> where <HI>the State of Nature obtains,</HI> and there are no <HI>Positive Constitutions</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acit or Express) Regulating the matter of Property, <HI>this is the only Way</HI> of begin∣ning a Property in things, be it <HI>Land</HI> or what else you please, it seems no way Difficult to Determine upon the extent of mens Properties during the con∣tinuance of this state of things among them, for this being the Cause and <HI>Original</HI> of all <HI>Property,</HI> must be the <HI>Measure of it</HI> too, whatever ways of fixing a Property in things thus firstly impropria∣ted, may be consequent upon it: As far as <HI>Labour extends,</HI> and things by that are taken out of the common state <HI>Nature</HI> left them in, so far the <HI>Right of Property</HI> must extend and no further, what is beyond this must remain still in the same <HI>Common State</HI> it was made in. And further, at the same time Reason forces us to conclude that as to a Right of <HI>Property in Land particularly,</HI> it can't be of great Extent during mens continuance <HI>in this State,</HI>
<PB N="xxviii" REF="002722_0016_0FE61306E516A8D0"/>at least so long as they continue their Simple, Mean, Inartful way of Living, are mainly fed and cloth'd with <HI>Roots, Fish, Fowl, Deer, Skins,</HI> &amp;c. The Sponta∣neous productions of Nature, &amp; have those provisi∣ons of it in such plenty that want does not oblige them to Cultivate or Till the Earth. While things continue thus among them, what Temptation can they have to Impropriate much, especially if at the some time the necessary Utensils, such as <HI>Ploughs, Hoes, Axes,</HI> &amp;c. are wanting, as we all know was the case with <HI>the Aborigines of this Country</HI> before the arrival of the <HI>English</HI> to it.</P>
<P N="20">§ 20. And now from what I have thus said concerning the way of <HI>Original</HI> or <HI>Primary Impropri∣ation</HI> in the state of Nature, it can't be difficult to determine of the Extent of the properties of <HI>the Aborigines of this Country,</HI> or any of them in I and at the time of the Access of the <HI>English</HI> to it, on the Supposition of their being in <HI>this State;</HI> Inas∣much as it assures us their <HI>Labour</HI> or <HI>Improvement</HI> was the measure of it. And to instance in the <HI>Moheags</HI> in particular, or any of them, concerning whose <HI>Pretended Claims</HI> there has been so much Noise and Strife in the Country, which even to this Day is not ended, what has been said assures us that on the Supposition of their being in this state at that time, instead of such <HI>large Territories</HI> they have been ignorantly (as well as knavishly enough no doubt) tho't by some to have, <HI>they had really good

§ 23. Nor is it as I conceive any <HI>Conclusive Evi∣dence</HI> of the contrary that they Liv'd in <HI>some sort of Society</HI> or Neighbourhood and had their <HI>Chiefs</HI> or <HI>Superiors</HI> among them, whether they were such as were so <HI>by Nature</HI> and <HI>Age,</HI> or <HI>by Election:</HI> Since <HI>the State of Nature,</HI> tho' it Banish or Implys an Ab∣sence of <HI>all Inequality among Men</HI> as to <HI>Civil Autho∣rity</HI> or Jurisdiction, yet does not exclude <HI>all Inequal∣lity whatsoever.</HI> The State of <HI>Nature</HI> is a <HI>State of Subjection</HI> to the Dictates and Direction of <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> which Law is so far from Banishing <HI>all Inequality</HI> or <HI>Subordination</HI> among Men, that <HI>it Or∣dains it in diverse Instances</HI> of it, particularly in the Relations of <HI>Parents &amp; Children, Husband &amp; Wise, Captain &amp; Souldiers,</HI> right reason which is this Law says there shall be <HI>Subjection &amp; Subordination.</HI> These Inequalities therefore are no ways Inconsistent with this State, nor of themselves Evidences it does not obtain among any. And these I think it <HI>not Im∣probable,</HI> were the only <HI>Inequalities</HI> or <HI>Subordinations</HI> among the Persons I am now speaking of at this time and perhaps ever before. Their <HI>Chiefs</HI> or <HI>Superiors</HI> seem to have been either such as were so by <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Age, Ancient Fathers,</HI> or <HI>Military Heads</HI> chosen by them to lead them out against <HI>their Ene∣mies.</HI> Thus where <HI>Families</HI> among them happened to be <HI>Numerous,</HI> continued <HI>entire together,</HI> and tho't themselves <HI>Sufficient to Subsist by themselves</HI> without Uniting with others, (as was oft the case no doubt, in that Day when there was no want of Land, all
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="002722_0018_0FE61308A01FE850"/>the Country, excepting <HI>here and there a Spot,</HI> was an Uncultivated Wilderness, all Provisions of Na∣ture Accommodate to their Plain, Mean, Inartful Way of Living were in great Plenty, and nothing found to give Price to them farther than this did, and Consequently <HI>Temptations and Occasions</HI> of Strife or <HI>Contention</HI> among them were few and rare, during this Day or Time I say) <HI>the Fathers</HI> of such Families <HI>in Succession</HI> seem to have been their only <HI>Superiors</HI> or <HI>Chiefs,</HI> and by the exercise of their <HI>Paternal Authority,</HI> (to which such Families had been Accustomed) maintained <HI>the little Order</HI> was among them: They seem to have been their <HI>Cap∣tains</HI> or <HI>Leaders</HI> too when Occasion requir'd, unless by reason of some Defect of <HI>Body</HI> or <HI>Mind</HI> they were Incapable of it. But when the case happened to be otherwise, as no doubt it often did, and <HI>diverse Families</HI> saw a necessity of <HI>Uniting together</HI> for their better Security against <HI>Foreign Force,</HI> their <HI>Su∣periors</HI> or <HI>Chiefs</HI> were by Election, and seem to have been chosen by them for no other end than to <HI>be Generals of their Armies,</HI> as among their Bre∣thren in <HI>Peru,</HI> &amp;c. before mention'd. Nor do they seem to have had but little, if any <HI>Dominion at Home in times of Peace.</HI> In this Respect they seem (if the Comparison may be allow'd) to be like <HI>the Judges in Israel of Old,</HI> who certainly were little, if any thing, more <HI>than Generals of their Armies.</HI></P>

§ 24. These I am much inclin'd to think were the <HI>only Superiors</HI> or <HI>Chiefs</HI> they had among them, and which perhaps by an Abuse or Misapplication of the Term, <HI>Sachem</HI> (which probably in its Original sense intends no more than a <HI>Chief Father or Captain</HI>) have in later times gone by the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Civil H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ads.</HI> And tho' perhaps s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me will say this is all but <HI>Conjecture</HI> or <HI>Chimaera,</HI> and as such only to be regarded; yet I must tell them I can't but much incline <HI>to this Opinion,</HI> and think I shall do so till I can see some further evidence of <HI>the Essentials of Kings</HI> in them than ever yet I did, and can believe that there is so much of Spell in that Title or <HI>Epithet</HI> that the bare Application of it to a Person is Sufficient without any thing else, to make him <HI>in fact</HI> so. But whatever may be the Truth as to this, and on which side soever those who are Judicious, &amp; more Learned in these things than I, may resolve the matter, yet supposing what I have Discover'd as my <HI>Prevailing Opinion</HI> in the case, to be Truth and that after all the <HI>Honours done their Chiefs</HI> by the Glorious Titles of <HI>Kings, Emperors, Allies,</HI> &amp;c. they were but <HI>Chief Fathers</HI> or <HI>Captains</HI> and really in <HI>the State of Nature</HI> with the rest of their Brethren, I think its pretty clear <HI>the Proper∣ties</HI> of any or all of them in Lands were of no greater extent than has been above expressed, and Consequently <HI>vastly short</HI> of what by many want∣ing Probity and Sense we have been born in hand they were.</P>

§ 25. I come now to consider the <HI>Second Hy∣pothesis, viz.</HI> That how <HI>Defective</HI> or <HI>Wanting</HI> soever their State might be as to the foremention'd re∣quisites <HI>of a State of Civil Society,</HI> and though Judg∣ing by what was generally Practiced among them, (every one retaining in his own Hands <HI>the Rights of the Law of Nature</HI>) they seem to have been in that State, Yet that they had <HI>really quitted it,</HI> en∣tred into <HI>Communities,</HI> and by <HI>Compact,</HI> and at least <HI>Tacit Constitutions</HI> of their own, settled the <HI>matter of Property,</HI> both with <HI>their Neighbours</HI> respectively, &amp; <HI>severally among themselves;</HI> and that these foremen∣tion'd <HI>Customs,</HI> with others of the like Nature ar∣guing <HI>the State of Nature</HI> obtaining among them, were rather from a <HI>Defect</HI> in Establishing proper Methods for the Execution of their Laws, than Evidences that they had none.</P>
<P N="26">§ 26. I have already expressed <HI>my Sentiment</HI> in this matter, which whether it be right or wrong, matters not as to what is now before me, which is to <HI>Consider this Opinion</HI> and see what (upon a Supposition of the truth of it) can be determined upon <HI>the Claims or Pretensions</HI> of any of them to Lands in the Country. And I am pretty well assured this Opinion, (how fond so ever our <HI>Bigots to Native Right</HI> are of it, yet will less serve that Interest, at least <HI>in the Present Day,</HI> than the former; in as much as on a Supposition of it; tho' it must be allow'd they had a <HI>Common Property</HI>

<P N="27">§ 27. That allowing it <HI>to be true</HI> that they <HI>had quitted the state of Nature,</HI> and put on <HI>some Form of civil Policy,</HI> yet it does not from thence necessarily follow that Lands were brought under the Regu∣lation <HI>of Compact,</HI> or any <HI>Positive Constitutions of their own,</HI> (tacit or express:) O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they were held by them any otherwise than as in <HI>the State and by the Law of Nature.</HI> Certain it is there is no necessary Connexion between those things, the <HI>For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner</HI> does not infer the <HI>Latter;</HI> A People may put on some Form of <HI>Policy</HI> without any Deter∣mination of the matter of <HI>Property in Lands</HI> whether by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompact</HI> with Neighbouring <HI>Polities</HI> or any <HI>Posi∣tive Constitutions</HI> of their own. And for my own part I never yet saw any sufficient Reason to conclude there was any thing of this nature done by them before the Arrival of the <HI>English</HI> here: Nor do I think it will seem probable there was, to any

And who knows not that this was <HI>the very Case</HI> with the Persons I am speaking of, before
<PB N="xxxix" REF="002722_0021_0FE5F3ACC81058A8"/>the Arrival of the <HI>English</HI> here. For this reason I think it highly <HI>Probable,</HI> yea next to <HI>a Certainty</HI> that such <HI>Lands only</HI> as their Poor way of Living rendred their <HI>Tillage</HI> of necessary (and how small a part was this compared with the rest of the Coun∣try?) they put <HI>any Value upon:</HI> the rest they looked upon as of no more Price, nor Advantage to be Impropriated than <HI>the Air they Breathed in:</HI> and therefore like other things of the like Nature in all Communities) lay Neglected in that <HI>Com∣mon State</HI> wherein Nature left it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nor let this be thought strange, since from <HI>Divine Revelation itself</HI> we have pretty good assurance that it is no more than <HI>was Common</HI> in the more Early Times of the World: There we find that in those Days men did not always immediately upon their <HI>Entring into Society,</HI> set out the Bounds of their <HI>distinct Territo∣ries,</HI> and by <HI>Laws</HI> within themselves respectively <HI>Settle the matter of Property;</HI> but suffered a great, may I not say the greatest part of the Land? to lie in <HI>the same Common State</HI> it was in before. Even in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s time we find men <HI>wandred up &amp; down</HI> with their <HI>Flocks &amp; Herds</HI> freely and without Mo∣lestation, seeking <HI>Pasture</HI> where they liked best; and that <HI>Abraham</HI> himself did this in <HI>a Country</HI> where he was a Stranger, and there were many <HI>Kingdoms</HI> or <HI>Communitie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Men,</HI> and they not newly formed neither. Which to me seems a pretty good Evidence that at least a great part, yea Probably the greatest part of <HI>the Land lay in Com∣mon,</HI>
<PB N="xl" REF="002722_0022_0FE5F3AD8FF24A68"/>that the Inhabitants Valued it not, at least so far as to think it worth their while to come to a <HI>Partage of it,</HI> and fix their <HI>respective Properties</HI> in it: The reasons of which no doubt were their Rude, Mean, Inartful Way of Living, Feeding and Clothing themselves mainly <HI>with what Nature Prepar'd, in</HI> which Preparations as they were in <HI>great Plenty,</HI> so Probably they had <HI>no Money</HI> or any <HI>Equivalent</HI> of it that might give a Value to any thing above what <HI>their way of Living did.</HI></P>
<P N="28">§ 28. I make no doubt there are those who will <HI>not Scruple to say</HI> the contrary to this is <HI>Evident in the Aborigines of this Country,</HI> and that in Fact they had <HI>by Compact</HI> and Constitutions Positive (Tac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Express,) Settled the matter <HI>of Property in Lands, each Society</HI> with <HI>its Neighbours,</HI> and among <HI>themselves severally:</HI> But be it so, I think its Probable, if not more than so, from what I have said, that <HI>they had not,</HI> and though I suppose I know the reasons on which they may so assert, as well as they, yet as I think they will scarcely <HI>weigh in the Ballance</HI> with the Evidence to the contrary given above, so desire to see some further and better reason for it before I believe it. Its very true that when after <HI>the Arrival of the English here,</HI> by <HI>Conversation</HI> and <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erce</HI> with them they were made Sensible of the Value of the <HI>Money</HI> they brought with them and made tender of for <HI>Land,</HI> they could not then but see that
<PB N="xli" REF="002722_0022_0FE5F3AD8FF24A68"/>the <HI>Lands</HI> beyond, what they Improved, and so held by the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> might be very Pro∣fitable to them, and on this I doubt not they were full enough in their Assertions of this Na∣ture, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>by Compact</HI> and <HI>Constitutions of their own,</HI> they were entituled to such and such <HI>Limits respectively;</HI> but this I think can carry with it <HI>little Evidence</HI> of the thing to one who knows what <HI>they were,</HI> and withal considers what is universally observable in <HI>their Posterity</HI> at this Day, when such a Temptation is laid before them. To all which I may add what I sup∣pose comes pretty near a Demonstration in the case, <HI>viz</HI> their <HI>Palpable Contradictions</HI> one of the other in their Pretensions, or the Accounts they gave, on this Occasion, of <HI>their Respective Claims</HI> or Properties, One <HI>Sachem</HI> or <HI>Community</HI> often Claiming <HI>what another did.</HI> This who knows not to be fact as <HI>to Lands in this part of the Country,</HI> where the Claims of <HI>Hiums, Uncass,</HI> and <HI>Sannup</HI> are found to interfere, the Con∣sequence of which has been that <HI>Persons Claiming under them,</HI> have endeavoured each one to set up his Title in Opposition to the other, to the no small Expence of Time and Money, as well as Hurt of the Publick.</P>

<P N="1">1. On a Supposition of the truth of this, <HI>Who can account for the true extent of the common Properties of their Respective Communities, or any one of them?</HI> If I have not been Misinformed some pains was formerly taken both in this and some <HI>Neighbouring Governments</HI> for a Resolution in this point: and for that end <HI>Persons were Deputed</HI> to Enquire &amp; Obtain the best light they coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Natives. What success attended these endeavours in <HI>Other Govern∣ments</HI> I know not, but in this I suppose <HI>none at all.</HI> Its true the Gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eputed by this Govern∣ment to enquire into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Claim of the <HI>Moheags</HI> made return of somethin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Assembly which they call'd an Account or description of their

But yet can any of those who would perswade us to think that <HI>Native Right</HI> is our only <HI>Valuable Title,</HI> Acquiesce in this or think it of any value, when at the same time their Neighbours, the <HI>Pequots, Quinebaugs, Nahanticks,</HI> (all of them as worthy of Credit as the <HI>Moheags,</HI>) give another Account, some of them claiming <HI>all the Lands</HI> within those Limits, saying the <HI>Moheags</HI> had <HI>none,</HI> &amp; others of them claiming at least <HI>Large Tracts</HI> within them. I suppose none will deny this to be Fact, or if there be that shall do so, that the Claimers under <HI>Hiums</HI> and <HI>Sannup</HI> will stand by me in it.

Nor can it satisfy any but Fools to be able in this case to say, they have <HI>Purchased of the Natives.</HI> Nor is there any thing I know of can help in this case but a Supposal of <HI>the False∣ness</HI>
<PB N="xlv" REF="002722_0024_0FE612F89284EFB0"/>of all <HI>their Pretensions</HI> to a Partage or Impropri∣ation of the Lands <HI>to any Limits:</HI> and that what∣ever <HI>Compacts</HI> they made Determining <HI>their Bounds</HI> respectively, they had therein a Sole Reference to the <HI>Hunt</HI> or <HI>Game,</HI> and Designed only an Impro∣priation of that; at the same time not having the least Regard to the <HI>Lands,</HI> nor caring, ex∣cepting as above, <HI>who had it,</HI> it being a thing of <HI>no Price to them.</HI> And this as it is Undoubtedly the Truth of the matter, so reduces the <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Property</HI> of such <HI>Lands</HI> to <HI>some Certainty,</HI> lets us know <HI>where or in whom it is,</HI> and to whom w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must Ap∣ply for the fixing a <HI>Property</HI> in them.

<P N="1">(1.) <HI>Where or in whom did they place the Lands?</HI> I Observed but now they were Originally or First∣ly <HI>in the Community,</HI> and equally so, and must re∣main so till by Acts of their own they make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Disposition of them <HI>into another Hand or Hands</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and reason will tell every Man it must be so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Now if by <HI>Acts</HI> or <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of their own they Al∣ter'd <HI>the Original or Primary State</HI> of the Lands, I Demand what <HI>was the Alteration?</HI> Where o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="xlvii" REF="002722_0025_0FE61370E666A488"/>in whom did they <HI>Place or Settle them?</HI> Did they Settle them in <HI>any One single Person or Re∣lation,</HI> or in a <HI>Certain Number of Men</HI> of any cer∣tain Order or Character?

I know very well Our <HI>Bigots</HI> say here, that <HI>their Constitutions vested all the Lands</HI> in <HI>their Kings,</HI> or in <HI>the Crown,</HI> (to Use our <HI>English</HI> Phrase,) but besides that that is spoken without <HI>any Proof,</HI> or any <HI>Possibility of it</HI> as I imagine, besides this I say, allowing it <HI>be Truth,</HI> yet it brings not <HI>the State of the Lands</HI> in any <HI>particular Community</HI> to any <HI>Certainty,</HI> nor Resolves us in <HI>whom the Property of all</HI> or any Part of them is till we are also Resolved in the following Particulars also, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>What they intend by Sachems or Kings in whom their Constitutions vested the Lands.</HI> Whether such as were so <HI>de jure</HI> or <HI>de facto,</HI> i. e. whether such as were <HI>Rightfully</HI> or by <HI>the Laws &amp; Constitutions</HI> of the <HI>Society</HI> so, or <HI>in Fact</HI> only. And in order to this we must be Resolved of the particular <HI>Form of Policy</HI> agreed upon in the several Societies, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether in case it was <HI>Monarchial,</HI> that they were <HI>Hereditary</HI> or <HI>Elective M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>archies,</HI> and not only so, but moreover whether <HI>Ʋncass, Sasacus, Ara∣mamet</HI> or any other <HI>Chief among them,</HI> of whom we
<PB N="xlviii" REF="002722_0026_0FE6134E281BC2E0"/>would obtain Lands, <HI>be King or Monarch</HI> according to the <HI>Fundamental Laws</HI> or Constitutions of the Society yea or not. For if not (the <HI>Lawful Kings Right of Property</HI> being meerly &amp; altogether from the Concession or Grant <HI>of the Community</HI>) they can't have any pretence to it; nor possibly make out <HI>a Good Title</HI> to any other.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>We must be resolved how or in what sense they vested the Lands in them:</HI> Whether so as to make them <HI>their Inalienable Right</HI> or Property, as the case seems to be with <HI>Land in some Constitutions:</HI> Or Alienable: And if in this last sense, whether they were <HI>so Absolutely</HI> put into their hands, that they had <HI>Right of Disposal</HI> where &amp; to whom they saw cause, or <HI>in Trust only</HI> for the Use and Benefit of the Societies Respectively? In which sense, as I understand it, all Lands in our <HI>English</HI> Dominions are by <HI>Our Constitution</HI> vested in <HI>the King or Crown</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Lands in <HI>this Government</HI> are by <HI>the Charter</HI> Vested in <HI>the Corporation,</HI> and for that Reason are Alienable from it, and may become <HI>the Property of others.</HI> If their Constitutions Vested the Lands <HI>in their Kings</HI> in the first sense, by what <HI>Right or Authority</HI> did they Alienate or Dispose of them <HI>to others?</HI> All Alienations made by them must be <HI>ipso facto</HI> Void: For if <HI>the Communities</HI> in Vesting the Lands in them ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them <HI>no power of Alie∣nation</HI> they could have none. If it be said they were Vested in them in the second sense, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="xlix" REF="002722_0026_0FE6134E281BC2E0"/>With <HI>an Ʋnlimited Power</HI> of making <HI>Alienations</HI> of them to whom they saw cause; I say this <HI>is Incredible;</HI> For if Lands were of such Value with them that they saw it worth their while to bring them under the Regulation of <HI>Positive Constitutions,</HI> its unreasonable to think they should in this sense put them into the Hands of <HI>any Person or Persons</HI> whatever: and by Consequence (supposing <HI>the Hypothesis</HI> I am now examining be true, and that Lands <HI>by their Constitutions</HI> (Tacit or Express) were Vested in <HI>their Kings</HI>) it can't be imagined they had Right or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower to make <HI>a Partage or Division</HI> of their Dominions among <HI>their own Children,</HI> to the Exclusion of the rest of the <HI>Community.</HI> For which reason I have ever tho't <HI>Allawanhoods,</HI> alias <HI>Joshua</HI>'s <HI>Right</HI> nothing worth, even upon <HI>the very Principles</HI> of the Advocates or Assertors of it. And if the last sense be asserted (which indeed carries with it the greatest Pro∣bability if any thing of this Nature was done among them) then I Demand again <HI>by what Right or Authority</HI> did they Divide their Dominions a∣mong <HI>their Children,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an instance of which was but now given) or make <HI>Conveyances of them to the English?</HI> Such Alienations must be as Void as on the Supposition, of the Truth of the first sense.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>And in case their Constitutions Vested the Lands in their Kings in this last sense,</HI> viz. <HI>In
<PB N="l" REF="002722_0027_0FE6133EB8456158"/>Trust,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>before we can be Resolved of the State of the Lands in any Society, and of the reallity and extent of the</HI> Right <HI>or</HI> Property <HI>of any particular Member or Member of them,</HI> we must be resolved also <HI>whether any Alienations</HI> were made by <HI>their Kings</HI> to <HI>their Subjects,</HI> and what <HI>they were,</HI> to∣gether with the Tenures in or by which they were to be holden of <HI>the Grantees.</HI></P>
<P N="31">§ 31. Its possible in what I have now said, I may not have expressed my self in <HI>the most Proper Terms:</HI> It requires perhaps more Know∣lege of <HI>the Law</HI> for a Person to be Able in an Affair of this Nature, to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than I may pre∣tend to. However I hope what I have said <HI>is Intelligible,</HI> and being so may Suffice as to what I Scope at in it: which is to shew <HI>what little Service this Hypothesis</HI> concerning <HI>the Aborigines</HI> of this Country does to the Interest many endeavour to Advance and Serve by it: and that a Sup∣position of its Truth Inevitably Involves <HI>their Rights or Claims</HI> in so many Inextricable Difficul∣ties and renders them all <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Uncertain,</HI> Perplex't and in the Dark that <HI>nothing Certain</HI> can be Known or Determined upon them. And though perhaps some may think what I have here Ad∣vanc'd as necessary on <HI>this Hypothesis</HI> to be Re∣solved, in Order to a Determination upon their Rights, <HI>Absurd,</HI> Yet I can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but think all those that think of things, not with the Multitude,
<PB N="ll" REF="002722_0027_0FE6133EB8456158"/>(who generally Speaking have too much <HI>Rubbish in their Brains</HI> to think of any thing with dis∣tinctness) but as they are <HI>in themselves,</HI> will say that without a Resolution of them nothing can <HI>be Determined</HI> with any certainty upon this Mat∣ter.</P>
<P><HI>To Conclude;</HI> The sum of what has been said is this, <HI>viz.</HI> Either they were a People <HI>in the State of Nature</HI> or <HI>they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> this I suppose all must allow, there being no <HI>Third State</HI> wherein any Persons either now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at any time heretofore were. If they were <HI>in the State of Nature,</HI> they had then Right <HI>of Property</HI> only in such <HI>Lands as they Impropriated</HI> (and held) by <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> which as we all know was only here and there <HI>a small spot</HI> in the Country. If it be said <HI>they had Quitted that State</HI> and put on some <HI>form of Policy,</HI> then I say either they had <HI>by Compact and Positive Constitutions</HI> of their own (Tacit or Express) Set∣tled <HI>the matter of Property,</HI> or they had not: If it be said <HI>they had not,</HI> then it follows that <HI>the State of the Lands in the Country</HI> was not altered <HI>from what it was before;</HI> but they all (excepting only what was <HI>Impropriated</HI> by <HI>the Law of Nature</HI>) re∣mained in <HI>the same Common State</HI> and Equally the Right of every Man, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they <HI>were before,</HI> while <HI>the State of Nature</HI> continue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: Nor was the <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>the Peasant</HI> distinguished as to Right of <HI>Property</HI> in them otherwise than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>the State of Nature.</HI> For
<PB N="lii" REF="002722_0028_0FE6135513E3FAE0"/>as <HI>Property in Lands</HI> is not included in the notion of a <HI>King,</HI> or the want of it in that of <HI>a Subject;</HI> so the making one Person a <HI>King,</HI> and another <HI>a Subject</HI> simply in it self, will not make a Right of <HI>Property,</HI> and <HI>give it</HI> to the One, or <HI>Banish it</HI> from the Other, without some other <HI>Act or Acts</HI> con∣current with it. If it be said <HI>they had brought the Lands in the Country</HI> under the regulation of <HI>Com∣pact &amp; Constitutions</HI> of their own, then it will follow that they had given <HI>up their Title</HI> by the Law of Nature, that what was before <HI>by the Law of Nature</HI> the Title of any of them <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds,</HI> was not, at least, <HI>qua</HI> such, their Title now; but that what <HI>Right or Title</HI> any or all of them had now was by <HI>their Constitutions Positive</HI> the inevitable consequence of which must be that till <HI>those Constitutions</HI> are de∣clared, and we assured what they Determined upon this matter <HI>of Property,</HI> nothing can be known or determined upon <HI>the Rights of any of them,</HI> we can't say where or in whom <HI>Right or Property</HI> was, whether in <HI>the Prince or People,</HI> some or all of them. And this having never b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th done, 'tis beyond me to see o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what Advantage <HI>this Hypothesis</HI> can be to the End for which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so Zealously Asserted by some.</P>
<P>But its time to haste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to an End, and from the whole that has been said, I can't but think the following must be all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to have <HI>Considerable
<PB N="liii" REF="002722_0028_0FE6135513E3FAE0"/>Evidence</HI> of Truth in them, how contrary soever to <HI>Vulgar Sentiments</HI> in the Present Day, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That such Lands only as any of our Aborigines Subdued and Improved, they had a good Right or Title to.</HI> For altho' we are sure they had <HI>the Law of Nature</HI> giving them a <HI>Right of Property</HI> by <HI>their La∣bour,</HI> in what before lay <HI>in Common</HI> and was E∣qually the Right of <HI>every Man,</HI> yet we are not sure (nor indeed have we so much Evidence as amounts to a Probabil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) of their having <HI>any other Law</HI> to Entitle th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>to Lands</HI> or any thing else, on any Conditions whatsoever.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Supposing their Chiefs to be Kings or Civil Heads Properly so called, yet there is more Reason to suspect a Right of Property in them, than in any of their Subjects.</HI> Yea the more reason to suspect it because of <HI>their Dignity.</HI> Nothing ever did or can ap∣pear Evidencing so much as <HI>a Probability</HI> of such a Right in them by the Positive Constitutions <HI>of their Communities;</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as for Acquiring it <HI>by La∣bour</HI> in Subduing and Cultivating, its reasonable to think <HI>their Exaltation</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dered that too great a Stoop for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That supposing the</HI> English <HI>to be the first</HI> (of Civiliz'd Nations) <HI>in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Discovery of the Coun∣try, they had</HI> (the Roy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Allowance and Favour Concurring) <HI>an Ʋnda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Right to Enter upon and

<P N="4">4. <HI>That a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Darling Principle of many,</HI> viz. <HI>That Native Right is the only Valuable Title to any Lands in the Country is Absurd and Foolish and may with Reason be look's upon as one of our Vulgar Er∣rors;</HI> So that the <HI>Endeavours of any,</HI> whether in more early or later Time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>to Maintain and Pro∣pagate it,</HI> (to the Prejudice of <HI>New Settlements,</HI> and not only to the Disturbance of <HI>Honest Men</HI> in their Possessions and Improvements, but <HI>Eject∣ment out of them,</HI> as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hurt of <HI>the Pub∣lick,</HI> as they have been without any Justifying reasons, so) <HI>must be loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon as very Culpable.</HI> Its well known that not only <HI>in the more Early Days</HI> of the Country, but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> later Times</HI> there have
