<HEAD><HI>ELIZABETH ESTAUGH</HI>'s TESTIMONY</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Memory of her beloved Husband <HI>JOHN ESTAUGH,</HI> deceased.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>INCE it pleased Divine Providence so highly to fa∣vour me, with being the near Companion of this dear Worthy, the Author of the following Sheets, I can∣not be altogether silent, but must give some small Account of the early Be∣ginning of the Working of Truth in him. He was born in <HI>Keldevon</HI> in <HI>Essex</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> on the 23d of the 2d Month, 1676, of religious Pa∣rents: But he grew uneasy with the religious Professions of both Father and
<PB N="iv" REF="005390_0003_10173186555EC788"/>Mother (they being of different Per∣swasions) and being a Seeker, sell in with the <HI>Baptists,</HI> and liked them so well he was near Joining them. But a Friend, a Neighbour, being dead, it so happen'd, that he was invited to the Burial, where that worthy Minister of the Gospel, <HI>Francis Stamper</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> being led to speak with Life and Pow∣er directly to his State, it made such deep Impressions on his tender Mind, that put him upon Search into the Principles of Friends, and being fully satisfied, joined with them in the se∣venteenth Year of his Age.</P>
<P>About the eighteenth Year of his Age, he came forth in the Ministry, and being faithful he grew in his Gift, fo that in some Time he travelled to visit Friends in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> After which he was concerned to visit Friends in <HI>America,</HI> and having the Unity of the Brethren, embarked in the Year 1700, and was enabled by the great Hand that drew
<PB N="v" REF="005390_0004_101731355BC2CFC0"/>him forth, to perform that Service to the great Satisfaction of Friends, and the Reward of Peace in himself.</P>
<P>Being then, and for some time after, freed from any Concern to travel in the Service of Truth, we were married to each other, <HI>viz.</HI> on the first Day of the Tenth Month, 1702, and settled at <HI>Haddonfield</HI> in the County of <HI>Glou∣cester,</HI> and Western Division of the Province of <HI>New-Jersey.</HI> In the fore Part of his Time he travelled pretty much; but in the latter Part he was troubled with an Infirmity in his Head, which rendred him unfit for the Ser∣vice; and his Good Master, that re∣quires no Impossibilities of his Servants, favoured him with being very easy at home; where, thro' Mercy, we lived very comfortably: For I'll venture to say, few, if any, in a married State, e∣ver lived in sweeter Harmony than we did. Oh! he was a sweet Companion indeed! A loving tender Husband; an humble exemplary Man; a Pattern of
<PB N="vi" REF="005390_0005_10173187D97CD378"/>Moderation in all Things; not lifted up with any Enjoyments, nor cast down at Disappointments. Oh! what shall I say of him, but that he was a Man endowed with many good Gifts, which rendered him very agreeable to his Friends, and much more to me, his Wife.— My Loss is as far beyond my Expressing, as is his WORTH.</P>
<P>Now after some Years (as before is observed) of Indisposition, it pleased the Lord to restore him to a State of Health; and soon after he had a Con∣cern to visit Friends at <HI>Tortola.</HI> This brought on him a deep Exercise, but when he was confirmed it was really required of him so to do, he gave up to it; Home, and the Company there, which used to be so pleasant to him, he was then weaned from. He first wrote to them; but finding this would not excuse him, he durst no longer de∣lay, but go he must. So, on the 13th of the 8th Month, 1742, we parted in the Aboundings of Love and Affection on that Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="005390_0006_10173138AF780DC8"/>
And now, the most acceptable Ac∣count I can give the Reader, of his Service in <HI>Tortola,</HI> is extracted from two Letters which I received from a Friend of that Place, directed to me, and to the Effect following, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>On the 8th of the 9th Month,</HI> 1742, <HI>he arrived at the House of</HI> John Picker∣ing <HI>with his Companion</HI> John Cadwa∣lader, <HI>where they were received with much Love and great Joy, being made to rejoice together in the tender Mercies and Love of God, which was greatly manifested that Day, to the Honour and Praise of his great Name, and also to the Comforting of his poor People.—The Testimonies of these Servants of the Lord were with Life and Power, and were as Clouds fill'd with Rain upon a thirsty Land.</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>But to be more particular concerning thy dear Husband, whose Memory is dear and precious to me, and many more whose Hearts were open to receive the Glad Tydings which he brought. His godly
<PB N="viii" REF="005390_0007_1017313BAD0B24A8"/>Life and Conversation spoke him to be a true Follower of the Lamb, and Minister of Jesus Christ, whom he freely preached, and by the effectual Power of whose di∣vine Love, was he called forth to our Assistance, for which we bless, praise and magnify the God of all our Mercies: And as a faithful Messenger, with much Love, in a tender Frame of Spirit, would be invite all to the Fountain which had healed him. O! the deep Humility that appeared in him in the Time of his publick Testimony; and when in private Conversation with his near and dear Friends, as he often said we were to him, how chearful and pleasant would he be, in that blessed Freedom wherein Christ had made him free. Innocent, harmless, of a chearful Countenance, yet not with∣out a Christian Gravity well becoming the Doctrine he preached. He was va∣liant for the Truth to the last, and tho' he is gone to his Grave, his Memory is sweet and precious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He had his Health very well until the
<PB N="ix" REF="005390_0008_1017314197F383F8"/>Death of his dear Companion; but go∣ing to his Burial, we were caught in a Shower of Rain, which we, and he, be∣lieved was the Occasion of his Illness. However, he was mightily favoured with the Divine Presence, which enab∣led him to answer the Service of that Day; and the next, being the first Day of the Week, we had a blessed Meeting, the Lord's Presence accompanying us; and tho' thy dear Husband was so near his End, his Candle shin'd as bright as ever, and many that beheld it, were made to glorify God on his Behalf. This was the last Opportunity on this Island, save his Farewell upon his dying Bed, where he both preached and prayed, a little before his Departure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On the next Day, being the second of the Week, he went to a little Island cal∣led</HI> Jos Vandicks, <HI>accompanied with se∣veral Friends; but on the 3d day in the Morning he complained very much, yet was enabled to go to Meeting, where were a pretty many People waiting to
<PB N="x" REF="005390_0009_10173140127599E8"/>hear the Word of Life declared, and a blessed Opportunity we had together, to the tendring and melting our Hearts in∣to a heavenly Frame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But he, who never spared his Labour whilst amongst us, extending his Voice as a Trumpet of the Lord's own sound∣ing, was so inwardly spent he was ready to faint. However, he went on board the Sloop that Afternoon, and next Mor∣ning came ashore at our House; where he had not been long before a shivering Fit seized him, and a Fever soon follow∣ed, which kept its constant Course every Day. This being the 1st day of the 10th Month, he took great Notice that it en∣ded Forty Years since his Marriage with thee; that during that Time you had lived in much Love, and parted in the same; and that thou wast his greatest Concern of all outward Enjoyments. And tho' the last two Days he was in much Pain, yet he was preserved under it in much Patience and Resignation, and had his perfect Senses to the last, exhorting
<PB N="xi" REF="005390_0010_10173148F7A9F448"/>Friends to Faithfulness,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And on the 6th Day of the 10th Month, about 6 a Clock at Night, he went away like a Lamb, with Praises and Thanksgivings in his Lips but about two Minutes be∣fore.</HI>—Thus far from the said Letters.</P>
<P>And thus finished this dear Worthy in the 67th Year of his Age, at the House of <HI>William Thomas</HI> on the Island of <HI>Tortola;</HI> highly favour'd by his great and good God in the very extreme Moments; the Consideration whereof, and the Account given of his Service, afford me, at times, some Relief; but, alas! my Wound is so deep, nothing but the healing Balm from above can effect my Cure. My Loss is inexpressible; yet since it is the Will of the Almighty, it becomes me to submit, tho' it be hard so to do.</P>
<P>Oh! a sweet and blessed End indeed to go away as in Raptures of Life, ga∣thered by the Almighty as a choice Flower, in full Perfection and Fragran∣cy! For sure, few, if any Man, ever
<PB N="xii" REF="005390_0011_101731895F0C1AD8"/>left a sweeter Savour, both at home and abroad, than he has done: Having li∣ved belov'd, is gone lamented in gene∣ral; and therefore it is no Wonder that I, who am so much the greatest Loser, lament and bemoan my great, my great Loss! And yet in the Midst of all, I have a secret Satisfaction in that I was enabled to give him up (tho' so dear to me) unto the Service into which he was called. This is but just a Hint for those who may be under the like Exercise and Tryal, that they may not hold back, but submit, and freely give up their All, leaving the Consequence to the wise disposing Hand, who knows for what Cause it is He is pleased so nearly to try his People, some with Life itself, others near it, and the Cause yet hid.</P>

<HEAD>THE TESTIMONY Of FRIENDS of the Monthly Meeting of <HI>Haddonfield,</HI> con∣cerning our dear Friend JOHN ESTAUGH, deceased.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>UR worthy Friend having been a faithful Labourer in the Work of the Gospel amongst us great Part of <HI>Forty Years;</HI> and many of us knowing by Good Experience the Ef∣fects of his Service, we find ourselves engaged to give in this Testimony on his Behalf, <HI>viz.</HI> That by and thro' the Divine Virtue and Power by which he was first reached and wrought upon,
<PB N="xiv" REF="005390_0013_1017318AE7729E18"/>he was early called to the Work of the Ministry, and made a chosen Vessel fit∣ted to hold the heavenly Treasure which dwelt plentifully in him. A true Gos∣pel Minister, dividing the Word aright; his Doctrine at Times having dropped as Dew, and his Speech distilled as the small Rain upon the tender Plants, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.2. A Man of great Humi∣lity and Compassion, sympathising with the Afflicted in Body or Mind; being sometimes enabled, as with healing Oil, to comfort the Sorrowful, the heavy-hearted and sincere Seekers of Christ Jesus: In this he had an extraordinary Talent; and yet, on the other hand, was close in his Reproofs and Exhor∣tations to the Careless and Disobedient; of which the following Sheets are a Specimen.</P>
<P>He was zealous for preserving good Order in the Church; and for main∣taining Love and Unity, that Badge of true Discipleship.</P>
<P>Oh! we are sensibly and sorrowfully
<PB N="xv" REF="005390_0014_1017314A7B64AA88"/>affected with our Loss; and yet we must not repine; nor dare we say to the Almighty, What doest thou?</P>
<P>Since his first Settlement among us, he visited <HI>England, Ireland,</HI> &amp; <HI>New-Eng∣land;</HI> and the <HI>West-India</HI> Islands several times. And when at home, as he had some Skill in Chymistry and Physick, he freely bestowed much Labour and Time therein, for the Good of the People of the Neighbourhood where he dwelt; and especially on the Poor, for whom he was much concerned; so that it may justly be said, the Blessing of those who were ready to perish came upon him, <HI>Job</HI> 29.13.</P>
<P>The last Visit that he made, was to the Island of <HI>Tortola,</HI> where, after his Service was over, he was taken sick, and departed this Life. And we make no doubt but that he is in the Fruition of that Glory and Happiness which will never have an End. Almighty God, if it be consistent with his Di∣vine Will, raise up, spirit and employ
<PB N="xvi" REF="005390_0015_10173190F0816778"/>more such faithful Labourers in his Harvest, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.38. to the Gathering of many to himself; and that Praise and Honour may be ascribed to his great Name, who is worthy both now and forever!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>LEST thou shouldst fall under some Misapprehensions, and judge contrary to the Truth, by thinking the Author of the ensuing Sheets was indu∣ced to put forth the same, through Fondness to appear in Print, I take the Liberty to assure thee it sprung not from so mean and vain a Motive; but purely from the Love of God which I felt to fill my Heart; wherein I was led to call to such, who are making Pro∣fession of the Truth, but are not duly concerned to walk therein; and to such as are the Offspring of our worthy
<PB N="xviii" REF="005390_0017_10173193EC2AF220"/>Antients; that they may solidly consider, whether the Way wherein they are go∣ing, be agreeable to that holy Path of Truth, in which their tender Parents walked, and for which some of them deeply suffered, and underwent many Cruelties, long and hard Imprisonments, &amp;c. from Men of dark and corrupt Minds. If this my tender Call shall have Place with any of the careless and negligent Ones, so as to turn them to Christ, it will answer the Desire of him, who was unwilling to have thus exposed himself.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A CALL TO THE Unfaithful Professors OF TRUTH.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE great Courage and Zeal of our worthy FRIENDS, who first received the Truth in this latter Age of the World, hath been often brought to my View. Many were the Hardships which for Christ's Sake they underwent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 5.11, 12.</NOTE> yet in all they rejoyced, look∣ing
<PB N="20" REF="005390_0019_101731956FC54750"/>upon it as a Blessing from God, that they were thought worthy to suffer for him; count∣ing the Loss of all things but as Dross and Dung,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.8.</NOTE> that they might win Christ. Thus with their All, they purchased the Truth;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 13.44, 45, 46.</NOTE> and having gained it were tender of it; watching over themselves and one another in Love, so that no Evil might get up among them, to hin∣der the Growth of that pure Seed which God had sown in their Hearts.</P>
<P>And here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 13.23.</NOTE> as the good Ground brought they forth plentifully of those Things which the great Lord of the Vineyard was well pleased with, who blessed his Work in their Hands, and gave them Do∣minion over their Enemies, adding daily to their Number, such as should be saved.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 2.47.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005390_0020_10173153A9F856C8"/>
Here it may be observed, what blessed Effects Faithful∣ness to God doth produce; by it the Heart comes to be purged from all Deceit and Filthiness, and the Soul beautified with Righteousness; and then from within,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth: 12, 35.</NOTE> out of the good Trea∣sure of the Heart, are good Things brought forth: But the contrary where the Heart is not made good; for the Evil Man out of his Evil Treasure, brings forth Evil Things (to wit) Pride, Covetousness, Ma∣lice, Envy, Deceit, and all Things that are bad: And to my Grief, I have seen too much of these appear amongst many, who are shrouding themselves under the Profession of Truth. But wo! unto you, ye false-hearted ones; for the Face of the Lord is against you, because of these Things; and the Time is
<PB N="22" REF="005390_0021_10173199FACE3EB8"/>coming, wherein you shall be made to know, a Profession will not do, altho' it be of the Truth it self.</P>
<P>Therefore in the Fear of God, I warn you all, whether Young or Old, to return in Time, before it be too late; for the Lord will not always strive with you,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genesis 6.3.</NOTE> altho' he is merci∣ful and long-suffering to- you-wards, and hath often visited you both immediately and in∣strumentally, laying open your Conditions before you; but Oh! how have you rejected him, and had those in Derision, who in Love to your Souls, have in the Fear of God some∣times reproved you, for your light and frothy Behaviour, which is out of Truth, and is prejudicial to your Souls ever∣lasting Well-being: And other times, for your running into the
<PB N="23" REF="005390_0022_101731598F790F40"/>vain Fashions and pernicious Ways of the World; and not∣withstanding the Evil of these Things hath been laid before you, from time to time, yet some are saying, they see no Evil in them, or that they should be let alone to see it in themselves: Others are crying, such or such things they are but small Matters; and thus the Devil is endeavouring to uphold his Kingdom in you; that if possible he might throw down that by you, which through the Mighty of God hath been built in his faithful Children, whom he hath cal∣led to his Work and qualified for his Service, who as good Soldiers are making War in Righteousness against all Un∣righteousness,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 19.4.</NOTE> and the Wea∣pons of their Warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, and
<PB N="24" REF="005390_0023_1017319CF0E02948"/>mighty through God to the pulling down the strong Holds of Sin and Satan, that so Reformation may go forward in the Nation.</P>
<P>But ye Libertines are against this Work; for you are en∣deavouring, to weaken the Hands of those who are con∣cerned therein; and thus do ye make the Hearts of those sad, whom the Lord hath not made sad; but the Mighty God will call you to Account for these Things,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 12.49.</NOTE> and appoint you your Portion amongst the Unbelievers, if ye repent not: Therefore seek the Lord whilst he is near,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 55.6.</NOTE> lest the Kingdom be rent from you; and then what will all the World avail you? ye shall then cry and mourn; but there will be none to pity you; for he whom you have slighted will slight you again,
<PB N="25" REF="005390_0024_1017315B15007700"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 1.26.</NOTE> and even laugh at your Cala∣mity and mock when your Fear cometh; thus will the mighty God who is just
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezekiel. 18.25.</NOTE> and equal in all his Ways, deal with the rebellious Children, who take Counsel but not of
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 30.1.</NOTE> him, and that cover with a Covering but not of his Spirit.</P>
<P>I therefore warn you in the Love of God to take care in time, and withdraw yourselves from the Evil Counseller, for his End is to destroy you, and to deprive you of eternal Hap∣piness. Therefore be ye awa∣ken'd, and incline your Minds unto the Lord, who is the Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, that out of all things which are hurtful he may gather you,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6.7.8.</NOTE> that so no longer you may re∣main, as the Ground which drin∣keth in the Rain that cometh upon it, and brings forth Bri∣ers
<PB N="26" REF="005390_0025_1017319FE7DA1E30"/>and Thorns, and so is nigh to Cursing: But the Desire of my Soul is, that you may thro' hearkning to the Word of Power,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isaiah 35.6, 7. chap. 44.3. chap. 58.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1.</NOTE> witness your Barrenness to be turned into Fruitfulness, and your dry Ground into Springs of Water, that Glory to his Name you may bring: For saith our Saviour,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 15.8.</NOTE> Herein is my Father glorified, in that you bear much Fruit; yet it must be that of his own Spi∣rit,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12.7.</NOTE> the Manifestation whereof is given to every Man to pro∣fit withal; therefore sink ye down in your Measures, and yield Obedience to the Living Manifestation of the Son of God, then will you know a Profiting aright, in the Way of the Lord, and here you will witness the strong Man
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 11.21 22.</NOTE> to be bound and cast out of his Possession; then will all Jarr∣ings
<PB N="27" REF="005390_0026_1017315CAE468AD8"/>and Janglings come to an End, and instead of shy Looks, and evil Surmisings one against another, there will be a Meet∣ing of each other in that Love which is without Dissimulati∣on: And thereby it will be known that ye are the Disciples
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 13.35.</NOTE> of Christ, for by this, said our Lord, shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if you have Love one to another: But where this undefiled Love is wanting, there also will the Mark of a true Disciple be wanting; and if that be want∣ing, it will not be any ones Say-so which will render him, or her, to be such; but accord∣ing to our Fruits shall we be
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 7; 16. ch. 12.33.</NOTE> judged: Therefore let all con∣sider what Fruits they are bringing forth; for he, or she,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.20, 21.</NOTE> which brings forth Strife, or appears in a peevish envious Spi∣rit
<PB N="28" REF="005390_0027_101731A2E6801440"/>against the Brethren,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">James 3.14, 15, 16.</NOTE> are thereby judged to be of the cor∣rupt Tree; for no such sower Grapes are seen upon those Bran∣ches which abide in the Holy Vine, and draw their Life from the Divine Root Christ Jesus: For they are of a peaceable Spirit, seek not Revenge, are not proud nor covetous, but of an humble Mind,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet 3.3, 4.</NOTE> and so are adorned with that holy and inward Adorning that the A∣postle spoke of, and which too many are Strangers to, who yet are making Profession with us.</P>
<P>For the Sake of these I am concerned, that the Gift of God may be stirred up, and have its Liberty in them in whom it hath been long sti∣fled <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 2.13.</NOTE> and opprest as a Cart with Sheaves: Many go bowed down in Spirit because of the
<PB N="29" REF="005390_0028_101731611636A540"/>Scandal, which through the Carlessness of these hath been brought upon the Truth (which is altogether pure and without Blemish in itself) who are crucifying the Lord afresh
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 6.6.</NOTE> unto themselves in his spiritual Appearance, and put him as to open Shame; causing many to blaspheme his worthy Name.</P>
<P>Oh! ye careless and unfaith∣full Stewards, do ye not con∣sider, that one Day you must give an Account of your Stew∣ardship;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 4.18.</NOTE> and if the Righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the Ungodly and the Sinner ap∣pear? who have rejected the Counsel and Will of God, and fol∣lowed their own Hearts Lusts, through which ye have been drawn from the Father's House, and now are spending your Portions as among Harlots; but the Lord grant, saith my Soul,
<PB N="30" REF="005390_0029_101731A62CC85330"/>if it may stand good with the Pleasure of his Divine Will, that as the Prodigal came to
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 15.</NOTE> himself, and saw from whence he was fallen, and in Humility resolved to return, so you, in like Manner, may come to a Sense and Sight of your Con∣ditions and humble your selves before him. Then shall you feel of the Father's Love, and he will rejoyce over you in your Return to him;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 15.7.</NOTE> For there is more Joy over one Sinner who repents, then over ninety and nine just Persons which need no Repentance. Oh! how is the Love and Favour of God herein set forth for the Encouragement of all to draw nigh to him, who are in any Measure made sensible of their lost Estate and undone Condi∣tion, if not pardoned by the Lord; and assuredly, he taketh
<PB N="31" REF="005390_0030_101731640EDA17F0"/>not Pleasure in the Destruction of any: For, as I live, saith the Lord God, I have no Plea∣sure <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezekiel 33.11.</NOTE> in the Death of the Wick∣ed, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live: And happy will all you be, who come to true Repentance, in the Day of your Visitation, and with Willingness go down into spiritual <HI>Jordan,</HI>

<P>But this Thing of coming to Judgment, is what many who are Lovers of Pleasure more than God, care not to hear so much of:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 30.10.</NOTE> But would have (as of old) the Seers to see not; and say to the Prophets, Prophesie not unto us right Things, speak unto us smooth Things, pro∣phesie Deceits: But alas! were it to be so, what Benefit

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eze. 13.15.</NOTE> and upon them that have daubed it with untemper'd Mortar; and will say unto you, the Wall is no more, neither they that dau∣bed it. Thus we may take notice how the Hand of God turned in Judgment upon both Prophets and People who were corrupt. And do any think, that there is a greater Liberty under the Dispensation of the Gospel allowed to Men, than there was under the Law: Oh! surely nay, for God is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil with Al∣lowance: For our dear Lord said,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 16.7.</NOTE> he would send the Com∣forter,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 1.19.</NOTE> is not that sure Word of Prophesy declaring to you, what your End must be if you deny Christ before Men? Oh! will he not deny you be∣fore his Father?</P>
<P>But it may be some will say, how do we deny him, since we profess Faith in him and own and believe he is the Sa∣viour of the World? it may be answered, that notwith∣standing you may thus believe, yet by Works you deny him; and so are making void your Faith which becomes dead thro' Disobedience, how lively soever it may have once been. Whilst you remain'd under true Subjection to the Will of God, you felt your Faith in Christ
<PB N="49" REF="005390_0048_1017317EE9961A58"/>to increase; for his divine Vir∣tue fill'd your Souls, the Sweet∣ness whereof was such as marr'd the Glory of this World; and there was nothing in so much Esteem with you as the pure Enjoyment of that Life, which our Lord and Sa∣viour gives to all them, who truly believe in and obey him.</P>
<P>And, he did not only come and give us Life, but that we also might know the Abound∣ings and daily Increase thereof; which, praised be the Name of Almighty God, a Remnant do witness; and can truly say, there is nothing they so much desire as the Continuation of his divine Favour unto them; and in order thereunto, are carefully watching over them∣selves, that they may not be mistaken, or led into Corrup∣tion; and are diligently coming

<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 3.21.</NOTE> to examine every Thought, Word and Action; that so their Deeds may be made manifest,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 15.5.</NOTE> that they are wrought in God. Oh! these are the Living Branches, that abide in the holy Vine, and are daily sup∣ply'd with Life and Virtue from that never-failing Root, which enableth them, Day by Day, to bring forth such Fruits, as renders them truly acceptable to God; which those, that abide not in him, cannot do.</P>
<P>For,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 15.4.10.</NOTE> said Christ, the Branch cannot bear Fruit of itself, ex∣cept it abide in the Vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me; and if (said he) ye keep my Commandments, ye shall abide in my Love; but such as are yielding to Pride, Drunkenness, Covetous∣ness, Whispering, Backbit∣ing, &amp;c. are not keeping his
<PB N="51" REF="005390_0050_1017320BF6FDDD98"/>Commandments, and so are depriving themselves of his Love. And what greater In∣jury can any one do himself, than to deprive himself of the Love and Favour of God? Sure nothing can exceed it. Therefore, saith every faithful and upright One to the Lord, whatever low or worldly En∣joyments thou feest meet to deprive me of, Oh! let me not be deprived of the inward Influences of the Virtues of thy divine Love: For what is this World, or all the Glory and Friendship thereof? it's as nothing to the true Followers of Jesus Christ, whose Love and Delight is placed in the Lord. And as the Mind is stayed on him,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 26.3.</NOTE> he will keep such in per∣fect Peace, and make his abode with them. And whilst he in his great Wisdom and Power,
<PB N="52" REF="005390_0051_101731C70A985378"/>doth measurably reside, and take up his Abode in us, our Hearts are filled with pure Zeal, such as is consistent with true Knowledge; in which, those who enjoy it are led in all Things agreeable to the Will of God: And what they do tends to his Glory: Being care∣full to discharge themselves of what they know is their Duty, and great is, and will be, the Peace that rests upon the Souls of such, notwithstanding the many hard Reflections which may be cast upon them, by such whose loose and libertine Behaviour they have reproved and testified against; which with some, is Provocation e∣nough, to abuse and bespatter, if possible, such of the Lord's faithful Servants, who cannot wink, or connive at Wicked∣ness, let it appear in whom it
<PB N="53" REF="005390_0052_1017320EEC8D6540"/>will, whether Rich or Poor; but must bear a faithful Tes∣timony against it.</P>
<P>For altho' those who walk in the Light,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John. 1.6.</NOTE> have true Fellow∣ship one with another, yet they cannot have Fellowship
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6.14. 15.</NOTE> with such as walk in Darkness, though they may be making an outward Profession of the Truth with us, and pretend to believe in the Light, as many in this easy Summer's Day seem to do. To be called a <HI>Quaker</HI> is not now attended with so much Difficulty as it wont to be; People may now go to Meeting without the Hazard of being sent to Prison, and from the Prison to the Whipping-Post; which was the Lot of many of our antient Friends, some of whom did not only suffer many cruel Beatings, but even Death itself; and all for
<PB N="54" REF="005390_0053_101731CA042F1B20"/>their Love and Obedience to Christ, whose Sayings they were fully bent to keep, and to do. And so approved them∣selves to be of the Number of those, whom our Lord likened unto a Wise-Man who built
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 7.24.</NOTE> his House upon a Rock; and altho' the Rain descended, the Floods came, and the Winds blew, and beat upon that House, it fell not: For it was founded upon a Rock. And praised be the Name of the Lord, there are yet a Remnant, whose Feet are fixed on the Holy-Rock, where they stand for the Cause of God, and are truly concerned, that the Camp of spiritual <HI>Israel</HI> may be kept clean:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. 7.1.</NOTE> and that no <HI>Achan</HI> may lodge within it. Therefore they are often making Search, and hunt out every corrupt Thing; in order that Unrigh∣teousness
<PB N="55" REF="005390_0054_10173210724FF588"/>may not lodge, or be secretly encouraged among us the Lord's People; know∣ing that there can be little room to expect the Church of Christ should flourish, where any thing is countenanced that is not consistent with the Purity of the Gospel; and therefore, the faithful Followers of the Lamb, are, as formerly, for having every thing kept under and destroyed, which is not of God, that so Truth may still be known to flourish in all who profess it. And that there may be no just Cause given for People to say, the <HI>Quakers</HI> are not so strict as they used to be; but come nearer to them, and can act as they do. For altho' this may be too true with res∣pect to some Particulars, yet it is not in the general; for the same godly Care which rested
<PB N="56" REF="005390_0055_101731CB9710F7E0"/>upon the Hearts of the Faithful formerly, yet lives and remains upon many to this Day: And they are as zealously concerned to bear a Testimony against the vain and corrupt Ways of the World, now, as much as ever: For the Faithful know the Truth is the same it ever was; and that it allows of no Liberty to commit Unrighte∣ousness.</P>
<P>And yet, notwithstanding all the Labour and Christian Care of the Faithful, there is (we must allow) too much room for such a Saying, respecting some in Profession with us, who can shape themselves ac∣cording to the Company they are with; when among the Sober and truly Religious, they appear demure, and seem very careful to use the plain Lan∣guage; but let them but turn
<PB N="57" REF="005390_0056_10173214E3F8F818"/>their Backs, as it were, and the Quaker shall in a Moment be all thrown off; and being in Company with those who can give Compliments one to ano∣ther, they are as ready with them as any of those who were never restricted from, but in∣structed and trained up in the Use of them.</P>
<P>But for you who are of the Stock of Friends, to be found in such sort of Behaviour, is ridiculous; and those you are thus imitating, though they may seem pleased with these Appearances in you, yet behind your Backs make a Ridicule and Sport of it, and bestow the Title of <HI>Bastard Quakers</HI> upon you; for they know it is not consistent with the Qua∣kers Principles to be found in such sort of Behaviour; and could the Parents of some who
<PB N="58" REF="005390_0057_101731D17171DE10"/>now practice such Things, have complyed with pulling off the Hat, and with the usual Ceremonies, they had not suf∣fered so much Cruelty as they did, because for Conscience∣sake they could not do it: For the Lord had convinced them of his holy Truth, through which they saw the Emptiness and Vanity of such kind of Compliments, both in Male and Female: And that it was not the Spirit of Christ which led into them; but that they sprung from a proud ambitious Mind in the Crea∣ture, which seeks to be adored and set up.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 4.6.</NOTE> But God resisteth the Proud,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5.5.</NOTE> and will punish the World for their Evil,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 13.11.</NOTE> and the Wicked for their Iniquity, and cause the Arrogancy of the Proud to cease, and will lay low the Haughtiness of the Terrible.</P>

Wherefore consider in Time, you who are of the Stock and Offspring of the meek Follow∣ers of holy Jesus, and break off from all such vain Imitations, which corrupt your Minds, and tend only to please and gratify proud Flesh which is to be mor∣tified; for it's of the Kingdom of Antichrist, and must be brought down: And the Day is come, and coming more and more, which the Prophet spoke of,

And praised be the great Name of God, a Remnant are brought in a great and good Degree inwardly and spiritual∣to experience, that as the Fire
<PB N="60" REF="005390_0059_101731D2F52197D0"/>in the Oven burns inwardly to the consuming of all that's Fewel to it, so doth the Word of God secretly and inwardly burn, to the consuming and ta∣king away of both the Root and Branch of Unrighteousness out of the Hearts of them who are subject to it; and all that are in good earnest to have a Place a∣mong the Sanctified and Re∣deemed of God, desire this holy Word and Fire of the Lord may not cease burning in them, until all be consumed which is not of Christ. And so may be ever more in Substance than in Shew, and to become firmly fixed in the divine Root, and so settled upon the Founda∣tion of God, that neither things present nor to come, may ever be able to shatter or move them from the holy Way of the Lord, And doubtless
<PB N="61" REF="005390_0060_1017321AD73A9C08"/>those who truly Witness such a pure inward Heart-work wrought in them, by the Power of God; are those that can answer to what the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> mentioned,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 33.14. 15.</NOTE> when he cries out, Who amongst us shall dwell with the devouring Fire? who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting Burnings? He then proceeds and gives Ac∣count who it is that should be able; it's he that walketh righ∣teously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the Gain of Oppressions, that shaketh his Hand from holding of Bribes, that stoppeth the Ear from hearing of Blood, and shutteth his Eyes from seeing Evil.</P>
<P>Oh! here the Loose, the Libertine, the cruel and vain unrighteous Men, may see themselves unable to stand a∣gainst the mighty Force of the

But let the Enemy whisper to them of something that is agreeable to their vain Appetite, Oh! how quick the Libertine Person can hear, and with great Pleasure open his Eyes and look upon Folly and Corruption, and receive Iniquity with Greediness: But whoever thou art, that thus yield up thyself to the Govern∣ment of Satan, and pleads for it, saying, There is nothing but

<P>Oh! thou poor Soul, who∣ever thou art, whether high or low, rich or poor, that art dis∣obedient to Christ, and got from under the Holy Cross, thou art now rejoycing in that which will procure a bitter Cup for thee, if not timely repented of: Where∣fore all you corrupt and libertine Ones, stand still and listen to that small but living Voice of

And such hath been, and still is, the Piercing∣ness of God's Word in the Soul, that how stout soever any have been, and though they may have thought nothing should ever bring them to confess they had done any thing contrary to the Truth, or worthy of Blame, and so may have braved it out, until Stillness was comman∣ded, and the Voice of the holy Judge heard, and the true and just Witness having liberty to arise, will so justly accuse such, as that all their Stoutness will be broke down, and instead of saying they are not be blame, there will be a Suing for Peace, and craving
<PB N="65" REF="005390_0064_101732210D17A388"/>Pardon for the many Offences committed against the Rules and Orders of the Government of Christ, which had been set up in the Heart.</P>
<P>And such is the Goodness and Mercy of him, the great and holy One, that upon hum∣ble Submission to him, such truly penitent Ones have met with Forgiveness, and through the Operation of his holy Power in them, have been set free from their many Corrup∣tions and Defilements, and have then been led to admire the great Mercy and Goodness of God to them, in that he was mercifully pleased to bring them to a true Sense of Con∣viction; and did not in his Dis∣pleasure cut them off.</P>
<P>Oh! faith my Soul, that all such that are now pursuing the Corruptions of their own
<PB N="66" REF="005390_0065_101731DBD847B6A8"/>Minds, might be thus seized and taken hold of, and timely brought to see the Want of a Physician; left it should be said to them, Depart from me, I offered my Help, but ye re∣fused; I told you what the Consequence would be if ye went on in the Way wherein ye were; but you would have none of my Counsel, looking upon yourselves whole, and wanting no Physician. Oh! here, a Day of Distress will come like an armed Man upon those who will not be won upon, or in any ways hearken to the Voice of the Lord. Ah! methinks, there are many who must assent to this Truth, and say it is not for want of being called unto, that we are found pursuing a vicious Life; for that the Lord hath often called immediately by his Spi∣rit,
<PB N="67" REF="005390_0066_1017322402A108E0"/>and also by his Ministers and other his faithful Servants; but Alas! may not such say, we have disregarded both; though we have at times been a little touched with the heavenly Influences of the di∣vine Mercy of God, yet, it was to us but as the Seed which fell on the High-Way Ground; for the Enemy's In∣ticements were so prevalent in us, that those tender Visitations and inward Touches of the Love and Favour of God, we were soon deprived of; and so fell from the Appearance of Grace, into Wantonness again, by which our Hearts are be∣come hardened. This is un∣doubtedly true, for by frequent neglecting the Visitations of the Holy One, Men may at last be so left to themselves, as to be locked up in such a State of Death and
<PB N="86" REF="005390_0067_10170FBF914A8B50"/>often concerned for; that as ye have entered into the Way and Path of Life, you may be pre∣served therein, and feel your growth to be in Christ the Li∣ving Vine;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 15.</NOTE> and where that is witnessed, the good Fruits are not wanting: For whoever grows in Christ, grows in all Holiness of Life; for what is received from him, is of a holy, pure and divine Nature; purging to the puri∣fying of the Consciences of
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.14.</NOTE> them that believe. And ma∣keth of such who once were Sinners to become Saints. And they who were once Blind have by believing in him re∣ceived Sight, and given to look into the Mystery of the Kingdom of God, in which his Glory is beheld, the least Glimpse whereof tends to mar all the Glory of Satan's
<PB N="69" REF="005390_0068_10173226F8B49618"/>been preserved and upheld, to the Praises and Glory of God; and by him made as the Salt of the Earth; for being filled with the Life and Vertue of Christ, and standing singly de∣voted to the Service of God, such have been, and divers yet are, made eminently service∣able in his Hand, to reach to the divine Witness in others; who through the Operation of the holy Measure of Life, have been brought to believe in Christ, and to become sub∣ject to the Government of his Spirit, and so have had Right to call him Lord and Master, by Reason they are subject to his Commands, and in all things seek to honour him, and living under a pure Sense of the Mer∣cy of God to them, in that whilst they were Transgressors, and even Enemies to his Rule
<PB N="70" REF="005390_0069_101731DED1BC92B8"/>and Government, he was plea∣sed to stretch forth his Hand of Love and Mercy, and make bare the Arm of his Salvation, whereby they now feel them∣selves set in a good Degree of Liberty from their old Master, whose Aim and Design was to have kept them in Bondage, and so to have cut them off from Happiness, or having any Place in the Kingdom of God's Glory.</P>
<P>Oh! let me now say to all you who have thus seen what the Lord can do for them that believe in him, hath not he brought you out of <HI>Egypt</HI> spi∣ritually? And altho' you may sometimes have apprehended that the Enemy was pursuing you, and the Sea before you, which brought you under doubtful Apprehensions, and filled you with a Fear of be∣ing
<PB N="71" REF="005390_0070_10173229FB7F1440"/>carried back into the old miserable State again; yet ha∣ving in the midst of this, hum∣bly besought the Lord, he hath arisen and made way for you through the various Difficultys which attended you in the Course of your Pilgrimage and Progress <HI>Sion</HI>-wards. So that there is no Room, or Reason, for any to sink under Discou∣ragements;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 49.15.</NOTE> there may be a pos∣sibility of a Woman's forget∣ting her sucking Child, yet it cannot be, that the Lord should neglect such as are faithfully o∣beying his Divine Will.</P>
<P>Therefore, be not faint-hear∣ted, or let in Unbelief, or think that because some whom you looked upon to be much before you in a spiritual Growth in the blessed Truth, have yet been o∣vercome by the Enemy: But let me say to such, who are thus be-Look
<PB N="72" REF="005390_0071_101731E1E73ED060"/>not out this Way; for here it is, that the subtle Adversary is endeavouring to undermine your Faith, and so by degrees will deprive you of what should be your Support, and take from you that holy Shield
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 6.16.</NOTE> which is the Quencher of the fiery Darts of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Oh! this has been the Way which the Serpent hath beguil∣ed some Innocent Ones, and brought such a thick Vail of Darkness over them, &amp; bereav'd them of the Light and Life of Christ, that some of these have not stuck to say there is no∣thing in Religion, it is but a meer Bubble: And so have given way to the Gratifying themselves in whatsoever their corrupt Minds led them unto: Such are fallen under some∣thing of the like Condition, with which the Apostle had just
<PB N="73" REF="005390_0072_1017322CF1F619A0"/>Reason to upbraid the <HI>Galati∣ans,</HI> where he says, Oh! foo∣lish <HI>Galatians,</HI> who hath be∣witched you, that ye should not obey the Truth;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 3.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> before whose Eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth cruci∣fied amongst you; this, said he, would I only learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? are you so folish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made per∣fect by the Flesh?</P>
<P>Here we may see, how ne∣cessary it is to keep a con∣stant Watch upon our Minds, for notwithstanding a State of Convincement may be come to, and some degree of the Ope∣ration of God's Spirit experi∣enced in the Soul, yet such a State may be soon lost, through looking out too much at the
<PB N="74" REF="005390_0073_101731E4DD0BE1F0"/>Failures of others. Had the Apostles been so feebly af∣fected towards their great Lord and Master, they might have all fell; for what a Shooking thing it must have appeared to be, there being but Twelve of them, and that one of them should betray his Lord, into the Hands of Mur∣derers. But we do not find it had any such ill Effect upon the other Eleven, as anyways to lessen their faithful regard to Jesus Christ, their holy Lord. Oh! then why should any whom the Lord hath merci∣fully favoured, with a true Sense and Feeling of his inward and spiritual Appearance, be∣come offended, so as to disbe∣lieve the Truth, because of the Failures of some who once may have been zealous Pro∣fessors thereof? and so to think
<PB N="75" REF="005390_0074_1017322FEC735560"/>it a sufficient Reason to decline having any further Regard to that holy and pure Principle manifested in your Hearts, and not only so, but become filled with Prejudice against the whole Society, and are led into a malicious uncharitable Spirit, to judge all for the Un∣faithfulness of some. And as this may have happened to some, whereby their Faith is overthrown, let all such, as now are ready at times to look out this Way, take Warning in time, and instead of looking at that which is attended with so much Prejudice, rather seek and diligently labour to get your Minds girded with the Girdle of Truth; and consider, that altho' one should fall to the right Hand, and another to the Left, yet God's Way is perfect, even and good; and
<PB N="76" REF="005390_0075_101731E7D934B2A0"/>he that hath a single Eye to it, shall be blessed with the Re∣newings of the Love of God, upon his Soul; and he, or she, who holds out to the End, will be saved. It was the un∣faithful Servants slighting and
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 25.27.</NOTE> neglecting the Talent the Lord had mercifully favoured him with, which was the Cause of his being condemned.</P>
<P>Wherefore, whosoever thou art, that hast been favoured with the least Appearance of the Light of Christ in thy Soul, be thou faithful to it; it is given thee to lead thee out of Darkness, and will, as thou follows the pure Leadings there∣of, bring thee where thou mayst have free Access to Christ, and through Faith draw of his di∣vine Virtue to thy Soul, in which thy Strength in him will be so increased, and thy Un∣derstanding
<PB N="77" REF="005390_0076_1017323171F84450"/>brightned, that in∣stead of stumbling at the Mis∣steps of others, thou will see it highly necessary to take heed to thy own Standing; and be∣ing truly subject to the Order and Government of the Spirit of Christ, instead of turning thy Back on the Truth, thou wilt then stand up for it, and in the Authority of God's Power call to those who are backsliding, and whether they will hear, or not, thou shalt find great Peace and Comfort in the true Discharge of thy Conscience towards thy Bro∣ther, whom thou sawest go∣ing astray from the Lord.</P>
<P>But instead of this Christian Labour with those thou may∣est see forsaking the Way of Truth, if thou shouldst suffer the Adversary to get in upon thy Mind, and fill thy Heart
<PB N="78" REF="005390_0077_101731E95F150030"/>with Prejudice against the ho∣nest and faithful Followers of Christ, here thou wilt come to sustain an irreparable Loss, by being turned back into the Wilderness again, where, by reason of Unbelief thou must be left to perish, as many of the Israelites did,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 14.26. 27.</NOTE> who were Murmurers against God and slighted his Servant <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, Oh! Soul, who∣ever thou art, and who may∣est read these Lines, if under the like Besetment as above ex∣pressed, my Heart is deeply affected for thee, and my sin∣cere Breathings to God are for thy Preservation. The Lord hath extended of his Goodness to thee in causing his Day of Light and Salvation to dawn upon thy Soul, and thou hast clearly seen in some good Degree, what is agreeable to the Will
<PB N="79" REF="005390_0078_10173235DE9D2498"/>and Mind of God, so that there is no room to plead and say, thou didst not know what his Will was. Consider therefore what Christ said concerning
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 12.47, 48.</NOTE> that Servant, who knew his Lord's Will and did it not; he was to be beaten with many Stripes. But he that knew it not, &amp; committed things wor∣thy of Stripes, was to be bea∣ten with few Stripes. For unto whomsoever much is gi∣ven,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17.30.</NOTE> of him shall much be re∣quired. In the times of Igno∣rance it's said God winked, but from those to whom he hath given of his good Spirit he is requiring Obedience, and a strict Conformity to his revealed Will; and such who fall short therein, may expect to meet with the like Repulse as those before-mentioned, who came to the Door and
<PB N="80" REF="005390_0079_101731EDC57AD500"/>knocked, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; but he answer'd &amp; said unto them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 13.25.</NOTE> I know ye not, whence you are; depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity.</P>
<P>And here it may be conside∣red, that it was their being found in Unrighteousness which caused the Door to be shut a∣gainst them; and altho' such may have to say, we have eaten and drank in thy Presence, and thou hast taught in our Streets, yet all this could make no Way for an Entrance, since they had disobeyed the Teachings of Christ, and were cloathed with Unrighteousness. And we read that no impure, or unholy Thing must enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Oh! all ye care∣less Ones, who now are making Profession of the pure Truth, but live a Life very contrary
<PB N="81" REF="005390_0080_10173238D7128650"/>thereunto, and so are in Danger of being shut out from the Mansions of Eternal Glory, (should you be cut off in your Transgressions) whilst the Lord is pleased to call unto you in his Love, turn not the deaf Ear unto him, but listen to his Voice; that so ye may be quick∣ned and made alive thereby, and be raised up out of the State of spiritual Lethargy wherein you are so stupified, that it is not easy to make you sensible the Way wherein you are going is the Way that leads down to Death and Destruction. But if ye once come to be quickned, and made alive anew; and have a touch of the Divine Eye-salve from Christ, then shall ye be∣hold that God is full of Com∣passion, in that he cut you not off in your Iniquity, but was pleased to lengthen out the
<PB N="82" REF="005390_0081_101731F0B81F0120"/>Day of his tender Mercy to you; and as there is a Turning from your Backslidings, then, as was said to <HI>Israel,</HI> I will not (said the Lord) cause mine
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 3.12.</NOTE> Anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not keep Anger forever.</P>
<P>And now, dear Reader, if thou art one who hast been a Backsli∣der, here is Encouragement for thee to come and humble thy self, and freely to acknowledge before the Lord thy Transgres∣sion and Disobedience to him; and as thou comes in an awful Fear, &amp; makes thy Addresses in Humility of Spirit, the Lord in Mercy will look down upon thee, and heal thy Backslidings. And that thou mayest be thus happily recover'd out of an Estate of Unrighteousness, and brought to a true and solid Settlement in the unchangeable Truth of God,
<PB N="83" REF="005390_0082_1017323A5BD361F0"/>is the Desire of one that seeks and prayeth to God for thine, and the Redemption of all Trans∣gressors out of Sin, through the Faith of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM JOHN ESTAUGH, <HI>To the Quarterly Meeting of Friends, for</HI> Newton, <HI>and</HI> Salem, <HI>in</HI> New-Jersey.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR Friends, as it hath been the Lord's Love which took hold on my Mind, and drew me forth from you, to visit his People in other Parts, so it's from a Sense and Feeling of the same heavenly Spring of the Father's Love, in
<PB N="85" REF="005390_0084_101732402DF05488"/>which I am now drawn to∣wards you, for ye are fresh in my Remembrance, and as at many other times, so at this time, is my Concern for you, that as God of his infinite Goodness hath been pleased to reach unto you, and by the Shepherd's Crook of his Love hath taken hold, and gathered you near unto himself in some degree, and hath often given you to partake of the Bread and Water of Life, through the Virtue whereof your Loves were at first raised to him, and ye fill'd with heaven∣ly Zeal, and were made wil∣ling to leave all for his Sake, and with the Apostle to es∣teem <NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.8</NOTE> the Loss of all things but as Dross or Dung, so you could but win Christ. And that this heavenly Mind may grow and increase in you, is what I am
<PB N="86" REF="005390_0085_101731F818CCC910"/>often concerned for; that as ye have entered into the Way and Path of Life, you may be pre∣served therein, and feel your growth to be in Christ the Li∣ving Vine;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 15.</NOTE> and where that is witnessed, the good Fruits are not wanting: For whoever grows in Christ, grows in all Holiness of Life; for what is received from him, is of a holy, pure and divine Nature; purging to the puri∣fying of the Consciences of
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.14.</NOTE> them that believe. And ma∣keth of such who once were Sinners to become Saints. And they who were once Blind have by believing in him re∣ceived Sight, and given to look into the Mystery of the Kingdom of God, in which his Glory is beheld, the least Glimpse whereof tends to mar all the Glory of Satan's
<PB N="87" REF="005390_0086_10173241B3D6FF00"/>Kingdom, in them who are thus favoured with the Dawn∣ings of the Day of God's mer∣ciful Visitation upon their Souls. With which, my dear Friends, you have been favou∣red, and largely given to partake thereof,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12.12.</NOTE> with many others, and by the one Spirit have been baptized together as into one Body:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.4.</NOTE> And have drank at the one Heavenly Divine Spring, and united together in that pure Love which flows from God, thro' Christ, to true Believers; and great was that Care which came upon you, for the Main∣taining of that Love and Unity which Truth had brought you into; and when anything appear∣ed, which struck thereat, how readily did you then joyn Hand in Hand, to get that cast out from amongst you, which had so ill a Tendency in it. And
<PB N="88" REF="005390_0087_101731F99F9C6458"/>God, who delighteth to behold his Children united together in his Love, failed not to bless your Endeavours.</P>
<P>And dear Friends, if the same Care be continued, you'l then feel the Lord will not be wanting to support you in what tends to his Honour;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 34.15.</NOTE> for his Eyes are upon the Righteous, and his Ears are open to their Cry. And for their Help he will arise, and what is wrong must be judged down by him. Therefore, let not any give Way to favour any thing which is from under the Cross of Christ, for those who would favour the Cause of such as are not wil∣ling to bear the Yoke, will thereby hurt themselves, and bring a Vail of Darkness over their own Understandings, and if Darkness prevails, Love will wax cold to Brethren, and that
<PB N="89" REF="005390_0088_10170FB81250C050"/>Care for maintaining Love and Unity will be lost, and instead thereof, Bitterness gets up, and hard Speeches are uttered, and grievous Reflections past on them who cannot give Way for any thing to be countenan∣ced or encouraged in the Church of Christ, but what is consistent with his Will whose dwelling is in Holiness,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hab. 1.13.</NOTE> and is of purer Eyes, than to behold any Evil with Allowance.</P>
<P>Wherefore, my dearly beloved Friends, be all careful to keep a strict Watch, each over his own Mind; that nothing that's wrong may get up, to harden your Hearts or darken any one's Understanding which God hath open'd; &amp; is the Watch be well kept up at home, and no evil thing incouraged there, then, such will become more and more in the Lord's Hand, as
<PB N="90" REF="005390_0089_101731FCD4A90C18"/>proper Instruments to watch o∣ver others, and to lend a helping Hand unto them who stand in need. And indeed, he that would help another out of the Mire, must first get out himself, and be washed from his own Defilements, before he can be helpful in so good a Work; for should Help be offered from such an one, who hath not passed under the refining Power and mortifying Word of God, it might well be rejected, and turned back again, and to him said, Oh! thou deceitful Hypo∣crite, first get a clean Heart cre∣ated in thyself, before thou offers Help to me.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50.16. 17, &amp;c.</NOTE> And God faith to the wicked, what hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou should take my Covenant in thy Mouth? seeing thou ha∣test Instruction and casteth my
<PB N="91" REF="005390_0090_10173247C28B2368"/>Words behind thee; when thou sawest a Thief then thou con∣sentedst with him, and hast been Partaker with Adulterers. And dear Friends, seeing there were such in many Generations that are past, who did presume to appear as Servants of God, and were not truly such, we need not wonder if there be some such in this Day; for there is the same old Deceiver,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 1.7.2.2.</NOTE> that's going about seeking whom he can devour, and he is not without his wicked and evil Instruments, by whom he is working: And as is their Master, so are they, full of Subtilty, and often under a seeming Shew of Goodness, and a feigned Humility, gain upon the Minds of some, and get a Place in their Affections; which being once fixed is hard to move; and so it proves, ma∣ny
<PB N="92" REF="005390_0091_101731FFCA200E68"/>times, of ill Consequence, when such an One comes to be discovered, and judged to be no other than a Deceiver.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Dear Friends, in order that That and all other Dangers may be avoided, let every one keep close to the Gift and Measure of Christ's Spirit in himself, against which no Device or Inchantment of the Enemy can ever prevail: For if we are deceived, it's for want of keeping a single Eye to our holy &amp; heavenly Guide, Christ Jesus; to whom, for all the Mercies we enjoy, be Glory and Praise for ever.</P>
<P>And, dear Friends, as to my Travels, I may with Comfort say, the Lord hath been with me in this my Service and La∣bour of Love to his People, so that my Way has been made
<PB N="93" REF="005390_0092_1017324AC0A6ABF8"/>easy, and so far as have felt it opened, I have answered; and now finding my self free and clear of that Concern, which lay as a Weight on my Mind, and, being at Liberty, think the Time long, till I am again with you. And if this Oppor∣tunity had happened the Be∣ginning of last Month, I should have came this Fall: But the Winter is now too near to at∣tempt it: I have therefore dropt the Thoughts of coming until Spring. My dear Wife gives her dear Love to you all, and through Mercy we are in a good State of Health, praised be the Lord. And may it please him, our heavenly Father, to protect and preserve us all in the Way and Path of Life, un∣to the End of our Time here, and at last give us an Entrance
<PB N="94" REF="005390_0093_10173202BB6BDA60"/>into the Kingdom of eternal Glory, is the sincere Desire &amp; Prayer of your truly concerned</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM JOHN ESTAUGH, <HI>To the little and new-gathered Flock of Christ in the</HI> Island <HI>of</HI> Tortola, <HI>Greeting.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DEAR and welbeloved Friends, having lately been favoured with the Perusal of a Copy of a Letter from Friend <HI>Pickering,</HI> Governor of the said Island, to Friends at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in which is set forth the great Goodness of
<PB N="96" REF="005390_0095_101732060A266B50"/>God unto you, and that through the Operation of his divine Power, divers are not only brought to con∣fess, but truly to obey the Truth; taking up the Cross, and following our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; and thereby a daily Growth is wit∣nessed; which Account is Joy and Rejoicing to me and many more.</P>
<P>Soon after, this good Ac∣count was received, our much esteemed and well beloved Friend, <HI>Thomas Chalkley,</HI> was in the Love of God drawn to vi∣sit you, and after his Arrival there, he gives an Account to his Wife, not only of his kind Reception, but also con∣firms the above good Account: And likewise takes notice, how the Lord had blessed his La∣bour of Love, and made his
<PB N="97" REF="005390_0096_10173250AB6E1A60"/>Visit truly beneficial to you, which affords great Com∣fort to all faithful Friends, who desire the Prosperity of God's holy Truth. And I doubt not, but it was a Time of Comfort and spiritual Joy with you, that you were fa∣voured with the Company and Benefit of the Labour of one of the faithful Ministers of the Gospel of Christ. But we hear, that the Lord saw meet in his Wisdom to take this worthy Instrument to himself, and though it may to you, and us, look as a Loss to the Church, yet as it was consis∣tent with his divine Will that it should be so, it becometh us to be easy and content there∣with, and now rather to look to our own standing, that we may through Faith and true Obedience maintain a Hold and
<PB N="98" REF="005390_0097_1017320900ECB1C0"/>Interest in Christ: So shall we have truly to experience what the Apostle gave Testimony
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12.12.</NOTE> of, which is, that by one Spi∣rit, said he, are we all baptized into one Body, whether we be <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles;</HI> whether we be Bond or Free; and have been made to drink into one Spirit, and being thus u∣nited into one Body, of which Christ is Head, we can∣not but have a Spiritual Sense, and Feeling of each other, tho' outwardly Strangers. And it is in the spiritual Sense that the true Children and Servants of God, both know and are well known one to another; and can symphathize together when under Affliction; and also rejoice together, when any Part of the Body is favoured with the Extendings and holy sweet In-flowings, of the Di∣vine
<PB N="99" REF="005390_0098_10173253A1774E78"/>Virtue of Christ. In the Reading of the above Accounts, my Heart was deeply affected with a Sense of the great and wonderfull Loving-kindness of God unto you, in that he hath caused his great Day of Light, Life and Salvation to break forth unto you, and through the Comings-up of the Life and Virtue of Truth, into Do∣minion in your Souls, the Glo∣ry and Gaiety of this World, with all its sinful Delights, are now become marr'd in your Sight; and to be ac∣counted Fools for Christ's sake is your Choice, rather than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin which are but for a Season, and will come to an end; but leave a Sting behind, upon the Souls of them, who run out the whole Time of their
<PB N="100" REF="005390_0099_101732A3F17EAB68"/>Lives in Sin, and will not re∣gard the Invitation of Christ.</P>
<P>But, praised be his holy Name, he hath highly favour∣ed you, in that he hath not only called to you, but even taken you as by the Hand, and led ye out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and as with <HI>David,</HI> pluckt your Feet out of the Mire and Clay,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 40.2.</NOTE> and hath set them upon the Rock where there is Safety. But yet, my dear and tender Friends, it will be well for you to take heed to your Standing, keeping a constant Watch, lest the subtle Adver∣sary come upon you at an una∣wares, and through some Stra∣tagem or another get in upon your Minds, and thereby draw by Degrees a Cloud of Dark∣ness over the Eye of your Un∣derstandings, which God hath opened; whereby you have
<PB N="101" REF="005390_0100_101733307A507780"/>not only been given to see, the vile Ways &amp; Works of Satan; but also, in the Name of Holy Jesus to testify against him, and all his corrupt and defiled Ways. But, Beloved, as you have thus broke off from him, by denying his Kingdom and Government, he will be laying wait to overset, if possible, the Work of God, in the Hearts of Believers in Christ. And where gross Sins will not be received, he then will assume another Shape. For the A∣postle <HI>Paul</HI> writing to the <HI>Co∣rinthians,</HI> signifys, <HI>Satan</HI> was transformed into an Angel of
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11.14.</NOTE> Light, in which false Appear∣ance, he hath sometimes de∣ceived some unwary and young convinced Ones, filling them with strange Notions and Opi∣nions, that were contrary to the Gospel of Christ, and so,
<PB N="102" REF="005390_0101_101732A85A361158"/>they have not only suffered Loss thereby, but have like∣wise brought great Trouble upon the Church, by causing Divisions and running into Heats and Parties.</P>
<P>But, my dear and tender Friends, I mention not this to discourage you, but that ye may be the more put upon you. Guard, and as you faithfully a∣bide in the Light of Christ, you will be able to discern Satan in all his Transformations, and in the Authority of God's Power to stand against him, and keep him out; and so disappoint him of breaking that Peace, Love, and Concord, which you now have and enjoy in the pure Truth of God: And so can join with <HI>David,</HI> and from true Experience say,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 133.1.</NOTE> behold how good and pleasant a Thing it is, for Brethren to dwell to∣gether
<PB N="103" REF="005390_0102_1017325993F325B0"/>in Unity!
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 133, 2.</NOTE> It is, said <HI>David,</HI> like the precious Oint∣ment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Beard, that went down to the Skirts of his Gar∣ments; and as the Dew of <HI>Hermon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 133.3.</NOTE> and as the Dew that descended upon the Mountains of <HI>Zion;</HI> for, said he, there the Lord commanded the Blessing, even Life forevermore.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 13.34, 35.</NOTE> And Christ said to the Believers, a new Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another; and then, said he, by this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if you have Love one to another. And <HI>John</HI> de∣clared,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John. 1.5.</NOTE> that God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all; and, said he, if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light,
<PB N="104" REF="005390_0103_101732AB52C71160"/>we have Fellowship one wit another, and the Blood of Je∣sus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all Sin. And these are true Sheep of the good Shepherd;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 10.4.</NOTE> and when he put∣teth forth his own Sheep, he goeth before them; and the Sheep follow him, for they know his Voice, and a Stran∣ger will they not follow, but will flee from him;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 10.5.</NOTE> for, said our Lord, they know not the Voice of Strangers. And, said <HI>David,</HI> I have set the Lord al∣ways before me, because he is at my Right Hand, I shall not be moved.</P>
<P>Oh! my beloved Friends, whatsoever your Trials or Be∣setments may happen to be, here will be your Safety, in keeping your Minds purely staid upon the Lord, and wait∣ing to feel your spiritual
<PB N="105" REF="005390_0104_1017325C91F28738"/>Strength renewed. For though its said the Youth shall faint
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 40.30, 31.</NOTE> and be weary, and the young Men shall utterly fall; yet they who wait upon the Lord shall renew their Strength; they shall mount up, saith the Pro∣phet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> with Wings as Eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint. And these as living Branches abid∣ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 15.1. &amp;c.</NOTE> in the Vine, they feel dai∣ly Supply from the Root. For, said our Lord, as the Branch cannot bear Fruit of itself, ex∣cept it abide in the Vine, no more can you, except you a∣bide in me, and my Words a∣bide in you.</P>
<P>And therefore, Oh ye tender and beloved Ones of Christ, take ye heed to the pure Word of God, which, is quick and powerful, and sharper (saith the
<PB N="106" REF="005390_0105_101732AE4EBD8770"/>Apostle <HI>Paul)</HI> than any two∣edged <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 4.12.</NOTE> Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joints and Marrow, and is a Discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 4.13.</NOTE> neither, said he, is there any Creature that is not manifest in his Sight; but all Things are naked and opened to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 1.19.</NOTE> This also, is that Word of Prophecy which <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> recommended to the Belie∣vers, to take heed unto, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and and the Day-Star arise in your Hearts; and this is what, I believe, you have had living Experience of; and can now say, though for a Time things ap∣peared but darkly; yet, as you had Faith in that small Appear∣ance, and did wait in hope the<PB N="107" REF="005390_0106_1017325F90487500"/>Lord would make farther Dis∣coveries to you, the merciful God hath looked down upon you, and hath caused the Sun of Righteousness to arise upon you, by whom all Mists are taken away: And the true Light shining, you see things clearly; and being cer∣tainly assured of the Way of God, you are led to bear Tes∣timony to the Truth, and to own and acknowledge with
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 4.29.</NOTE> the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman, Christ hath told you all that ever you have done. And, as he had convinced and satisfied her, what the true Worship of God is, so he hath let you see, it is not a bare outside Perfor∣mance, but an inward and spi∣ritual one, which is aceptable to God. And being convinced that the Father seeketh such to

<PB N="108" REF="005390_0107_101732AFD74AE018"/>him in Spirit and in Truth, and as the Way of God was so clearly cast up before you, ye found it unsafe to abide with those who hold a Form of

<HEAD>A SECOND EPISTLE <HI>Prepared by</HI> JOHN ESTAUGH, <HI>for Friends at</HI> Tortola, <HI>but not sent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DEAR Friends, I have received by our worthy Friend, <HI>William Thomas,</HI> three Letters, viz. one from my esteem'd Friend <HI>John Picke∣ring,</HI> one from <HI>Jeremiah Mar∣tin,</HI> and one from <HI>Fat-Hog Bay</HI> signed by nine Friends, all which are very kindly re∣ceived, and truly acceptable to
<PB N="111" REF="005390_0110_10173265906A4D10"/>me; and by them I understand, you had received my Epistle sent via <HI>Antigua,</HI> directed to our aforesaid Friend <HI>J. Picke∣ring;</HI> and by him I understand, it was read at the Close of a publick Meeting, and was to the Edification and Com∣fort of those present, which I am glad of, and also to hear, that our heavenly Father was so graciously pleased at the Reading thereof, to favour you, with the Renewings of his Divine Goodness, in opening the free Spring of Life amongst you, so that the Thirsty in <HI>Is∣rael</HI> were refreshed, and could sing to the holy Rock, and rejoyce in the God of their Sal∣vation; and being afresh bap∣tised and influenced with a re∣newed Sense of the Life and Virtue of Truth, were therein and thereby led (I doubt not)
<PB N="112" REF="005390_0111_101732B73609D8D8"/>to renew your Covenants with the Lord, and to take up fresh Resolutions, and to hope, through Divine Assistance, ye should never shrink, or turn your Backs of what the Lord hath shewn, or manifested to you, to be your Duties to him; but were ready to conclude, with good old <HI>Joshua,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jos. 24.15.</NOTE> let o∣thers Choice be as it will, as for you, ye will serve the Lord.</P>
<P>And now, Oh! ye tender and beloved Ones of Christ Je∣sus, in order that these pious and godly Resolutions may be kept to, keep ye under a close and strict religious Exercise, waiting to feel the Operation of the holy Power of God in your Hearts, and then in his divine Light, you shall not on∣ly see your own Weakness, but for your Comfort, shall also behold Christ, on whom help
<PB N="113" REF="005390_0112_10173268891B2958"/>is laid: And, as he told the Believers of old, so his Chil∣dren and faithful Servants at this Day, find, that without him, they cannot do any thing which will tend to God's Glory,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 15.5</NOTE> or to the Peace and Happiness of themselves; and therefore under a true Sense of their own Feebleness, such as these, by the Spirit of Christ, are rightly led and guided into a right Prayer to God for daily Bread. And as Bread natural is to the natural Man called the Staff of Life, or is that on which the natural Life depends, so long as the Lord in his di∣vine Wisdom may seem meet to allow a Being here, (For this outward Bread cannot be any other ways serviceable to that noble Part, the Soul in Man, than to support the out∣ward Tabernacle, in which she
<PB N="114" REF="005390_0113_101732B8C11A7C68"/>is allowed a Being for a little Space) so the Bread, the Soul is to live upon, and which is to be daily sought and prayed for,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 6.51. &amp;c.</NOTE> is the living Bread, which comes down from God out of Heaven: And is the holy Staff of Life, whereon every true Member in the Church of Christ, may safely trust and lean upon, without the least Danger of being deceived by it; nor hath it ever been known to fail any, tho' the least of the Servants of God, who hath stood up faithfully for the Cause of the holy Truth, choosing to suffer the greatest Cruelties that Man could inflict upon them, rather than to deny Christ.</P>
<P>Oh! it was this divine Power from God, in and by which our antient and worthy Friends were supported in the first Ap∣pearance
<PB N="115" REF="005390_0114_1017326B81BD4830"/>in the dark World: and as the Work, they were called to, was very great, the Lord did in Proportion thereunto fit them with Life and Power, and in the Name, and with Authority of the King of Kings, and Lord of Heaven and the whole Earth, they were led to proclaim the
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 17.3.4.5.</NOTE> Downfall of the great Whore, and false Church, which <HI>John</HI> saw cloath'd with Scarlet and Purple, and sitting upon the Scarlet-covered Beast, having a Golden Cup in her Hand, full of Abominations and Filthiness of her Fornication; and upon her Forehead was a Name written, Mystery, <HI>Babylon</HI> the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 6. &amp;c</NOTE> And, said <HI>John,</HI> I saw the Woman drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the
<PB N="116" REF="005390_0115_101732BD2D1BD618"/>Blood of the Martyrs of Jesus. But as soon as those faithful Servants of Christ, began to open their Commission, and in the Name of their Master to call the Children of Men to forsake her dark, sinful and adulterous Ways, she soon ap∣peared full of Rage, and caused such of her Servants, as got their Wealth and Riches by trading and dealing with her, to bestir themselves, inventing many barbarous and cruel Ways to afflict the faithful Servants and Messengers of Christ, imagining thereby to have extinguished and hindred the pure Gospel Light from shining; and in order thereunto cast many of the Lord's Ser∣vants into Prison, and dark nas∣ty Dungeons, having first slashed and cut their tender Bodies, and stripp'd them of
<PB N="117" REF="005390_0116_1017326D06D2BFF8"/>their Goods; banished Hus∣band from Wife, and Wife from Husband, and all for their faithful Obedience to Christ; But all this was not able to discourage those truly begot∣ten and faithful Servants of God; for being filled with the divine Life of Jesus they bore all things with Meekness; sub∣mitting their Cause to God: And were not at all deterr'd, or any ways affrighted, or put by their Duty and Obedience to Christ: But faithfully follow∣ed him, and his Regard was to them; and in the Enjoyment of his divine Love and Life, could in the Prison and dark Dungeons sound forth living Praises to the most high God, esteeming it as a Blessing that they were thought worthy to suffer for Christ's sake; and when the Lord had let their
<PB N="118" REF="005390_0117_101732C02787C428"/>cruel Prosecutors see, that it was not in their Power to stop his glorious Work, he then damp'd their hot and fiery Day of Persecution, and gave Rest and Ease to his faithful Ser∣vants.</P>
<P>And now, you tender and beloved ones, if it should be your Lots to be in some things tried a little for Christ's sake, yet be not discourag'd, but stand faithful to your great Lord and Master, who is still as able as ever to carry on the Work which he hath begun, and will not fail to relieve and comfort his humble and faithful Follow∣ers, who are chearfully given up to be order'd and directed so as may be consistent to his Divine Will: And may the Lord be with you all, and increase your Faith and Hope in him, is the Desire
<PB N="119" REF="005390_0118_10173271731E70E8"/>and Prayer of your sincere Friend, who in the Love of God tenderly salutes you, and bids you, in the Lord, farewel.</P>
