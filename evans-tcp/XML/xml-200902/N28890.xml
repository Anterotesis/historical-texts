<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>As the writer of the following narrative (being personally known to and well esteem∣ed by a number among us,) was enabled to bear a faithful and upright testimony to the peaceable government of Christ, and against the spirit of war, we think the Publication of it may afford strength and encouragement to others to follow his worthy example; we therefore recommend its perusal to the members of our religious society and others, hoping it may have a tendency to advance our peaceable testimony.</P>

<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE WAS TAKEN FROM A MANU∣SCRIPT LEFT BY OUR FRIEND JOHN SMITH, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE EARLY PART OF HIS LIFE, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE SOME ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCES, TRIALS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I JOHN SMITH of Marlborough in Ches∣ter County Pennsylvania, was born in the township of Dartmouth and county of Bristol in New England, on the 22d. of the 4th. month 1681; my parents professed the truth in their latter years; and as I grew to years of understanding the Lord was pleased to fa∣vour me with the knowledge of his blessed truth, and the work and operation thereof in my own heart, that by the virtue of it I came to be very much weaned from the vanities and delights of the world, and perishing pas∣times that are therein, and those things that I was inclined to by nature. And as I came to be acquainted with the discipline of the cross, and the divine light shining in my heart, about
<PB N="6" REF="038519_0004_101229190ED34DA8"/>the 22d. year of my age, I was called to bear my testimony against wars and fightings, as being contrary to the doctrine of Christ, and the nature of his kingdom, and could not join with those that were for bearing arms for the defence of the country, against the French and Indian enemy; and accordingly, on the 15th. of the 6th. month 1703, I was notified by one William Hart, called a corporal, to ap∣pear at the town house in Dartmouth, in or∣der to engage in the service proposed, under Benjamin Church, called captain, but refu∣sing for conscience sake to comply, I was summoned on the 14th. of the 1st. month 1704, to appear before Nathaniel By∣field and Ebenezer Brenton, two magis∣trates of said county of Bristol, and examined concerning my said refusal, in which I still persisting for the reasons above said, I was fined in the sum of five pounds, and one pound three shillings charges. But having a months time to consider whether to pay said fine or not, I found most peace in refusing, for which I was sentenced to prison till payment thereof, where I remained till the general sessions in the second month following, and was then required to pay
<PB N="7" REF="038519_0005_1012291C020AA4E0"/>said fine and charges: but still refusing for the reason aforesaid, proclamation was made in court that I should be hired out to work to any that wanted a hand, for any time not exceeding four years, in order to satisfy said fine &amp;c. but none offering to ac∣cept my service as above, I was sent to prison again, there to remain till an order was pro∣cured from the governor to remove me to Boston castle, there to work as a prisoner till said fine was satisfied. Here I continued in great peace of mind about two weeks, often being made sensible of Divine kindness in this my confined condition: at the end of two weeks, the above said Benjamin Church came and commanded me out of prison, which I refused to comply with, without the gover∣nors order agreeable to the judgment of Court, which order he never produced, but forcibly took me out of prison, and I was ordered on board a vessel to be sent to Boston castle; and on our way through the town we met two of our friends, who in a friendly manner asked the person who commanded me, what art thou going to do with our friend? he answered he was going to take him to Boston castle: the friends remarked to him,
<PB N="8" REF="038519_0006_1012291E1D62FEB8"/>how some people in such cases had been dis∣appointed in their expectation and their vessels in danger of being lost: but notwith∣standing this precaution, he persisted in his resolution till it had like to have been our case, for being put on board a vessel which had but little ballast in her, and sailing on our way to Boston, being about twenty leagues by water, there came a squall of wind and laid our vessel on one side, on which I ran and loosed the sails, so that she got righted before any of the hands came to my assistance, which the hands on board seeing were glad of my company, and I was thankful to our great preserver for this merciful deliverance. Be∣ing got to Boston we met said colonel Church, for he was both colonel and captain; I was allowed the liberty of the town, only to meet at a certain inn about the sixth hour every evening (which liberty I thought was a trial to me, whether I would get away from them or not, but I was their true prisoner, truths testimony being more precious to me at that time than my outward liberty,) which order I punctually obeyed, so that I had time to see my friends in the town, who shewed great kindness and respect to me. Thus I
<PB N="9" REF="038519_0007_10122921998F1B28"/>continued a prisoner at large in the town of Boston about a week, for the master of the vessel that brought me there, being sensible of the danger he was in at that time, could not be prevailed with to take me to the castle, nor be concerned further with me as a pri∣soner, but afterwards on the fifth of the third month, I was conveyed to the castle where I remained a prisoner four months and four days, being a prisoner from my first confine∣ment seven months and two days. And notwithstanding some pains were taken to obtain my liberty, particularly by our friend Thomas Story who was travelling in New England at that time, in truth's service, yet it had not the desired effect; during which time the people behaved civilly towards me, as believing I acted from a religious principle, but finding they could not make me submit to them they set me at liberty. On my mother's application to the governor, and making my case known to him, he ordered his clerk to write to the captain of the castle, an order for me to be released, which was done accor∣dingly. During the time of my confinement in the castle, there came a kinsman of mine to see me, he was of some considerable note
<PB N="10" REF="038519_0008_101229231F57CDC0"/>in the worlds account, and therefore came in disguise, not desiring his being there should be known, but as in a friendly visit: calling me aside, he said, cousin, since you have be∣gun, I would have you hold to your princi∣ples, adding I have nothing to discourage you, but believe if you are faithful the Lord will prosper you in your undertaking, which he spoke in much love and affection, and at parting prayed the Lord to bless me; which kind visit from one who did not profess the truth, was comfortable and strengthening to me in this my suffering state.</P>
<P>So being at liberty as above, I returned home to my fathers family, in much peace of mind, with praises to the Almighty for my deliverance thus far, where I followed my lawful calling, till near the spring following, when I shipped myself on board the brigan∣tine,—Matthew Eastow commander, bound for London. It proved a very stormy voyage, so that divers times we expected to be cast away, but the merciful hand was our preserver. I had many times with true thankfulness of heart to bless and magnify his great and holy name, in a sweet sense of his mercy and good∣ness to me.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038519_0009_1012292980549C28"/>
In about eight weeks sailing, we made King∣sale harbour in the west of Ireland, where we tarried about eight days, and then weighed anchor and sailed for London. We came to the landsend of England on the 13th. of the 4th. month 1705, and next day near Ply∣mouth, a man of war met us, and took me and two more of our hands; but the captain sent us on board our own vessel again that night. There lay seventeen sail of men of war in Plymouth harbour at that time, one of which sent their boat with some hands, and took my companion Thomas Anthony, who came with me from New England and myself on board their ship, leaving but three hands in the vessel with our master, although he was very weak, and not capable of any business. The ship we were taken on board of lay about five leagues off, and the next day went out a cruising: the lieutenant was very envious, and swore divers times that he would run us through with his sword; the captain seemed more moderate, although not inclined to set us at liberty. The day after we sailed, the ship we were in took a French prize with fifty En∣glish prisoners on board: when they were going to engage, they placed us to a gun,
<PB N="12" REF="038519_0010_1012292BE9530A60"/>and commanded us to fight, but we told them we could not, for Christ and his apostles spake to the contrary; but they not regarding what we said, hauled us about the deck to make us work, but we signified we could not on any such account: now expecting our trials likely to increase, we thought it necessary to be constantly upon our watch both inwardly and outwardly, with strong cries to the Lord that he would be near to support us under our exercises; also we thought it not safe that both of us should lie down together, so it happened on the 18th. of the month that Thomas Anthony being gone to lay down, I being uneasy in my mind had a concern to go upon deck, for what reason I knew not at that time, but being faithful I went upon deck, and therein I found peace; upon which I went between decks again, but growing un∣easy in my mind, a concern arose to go upon deck the second time, and when there, seem∣ed quite easy; then fearing lest I was out of my place I went down a third time, and growing very uneasy, it was said in the secret of my heart, thou knowest where to get relief; upon which I went the third time upon deck,
<PB N="13" REF="038519_0011_1012292D6E7D90C8"/>and being there some time, the lieutenant who was walking on the quarter deck, said to the boatswain who was on the main deck, have you made the Quaker work yet? he an∣swered no. The lieutenant asked why? was answered, it is for want of your order; on which the lieutenant threw him his cane, say∣ing, there is my order, then the boatswain took the cane and laid on my head with such violence, that he beat my hat to pieces, on which the lieutenant said, take him to the geers, and bring the cat and nine tails, at which time I was freely given up to suffer what they might be permitted to inflict on me; and being at the geers on my knees, it arose in my mind to pray for my persecutors, for they knew not what they did; and if it pleased the Lord, to take me to himself from amongst them, for their wicked conversation was a burden to my life; and indeed my life was not dear to me at that time, to lay down for truths testimony if required; but through the Lord's mercy they were not suffered to strike me any more. Soon after the captain sent for me and Thomas Anthony into the cabbin, where being come he talked much with us, and on seeing my hat he asked how
<PB N="14" REF="038519_0012_1012292EF35094D8"/>it came torn so, was answered it was done at the boatswains pleasure. There was the cap∣tain of another man of war with him, who swore he would kill us, as soon as he would kill a Frenchman, with many such expressi∣ons. The boatswains mate seeing how I was used, took me by the shoulder, and asked why I did not stay below decks as he would have me, adding you have been beat enough to kill an ox; which expressions of his shew∣ed some respect he had to me, though other∣wise bad enough in his conversation; but the sweet peace and satisfaction of mind, that I enjoyed in this time of my suffering, is scarce to be expressed in words, and far exceeded their shew of kindness.</P>
<P>Now there being upwards of twenty sail of the English together at that time, in a few days they sailed to Brest, a place in France, to fight the French fleet, but they not coming out, and our fleet meeting with a storm that several ships lost their top masts, we sailed for England, and went into Torbay, and lay there three days, in which time I desired the captain to set us at liberty; but he said if we would work, we should have our liberty, purposely as we thought to ensnare us; but
<PB N="15" REF="038519_0013_10122930811BDBF8"/>through the Lord's mercy and goodness to us, we were preserved from their snares, and found his pure peace and presence, to be with us in a large manner, that in the great∣est of our sufferings and trials, he was near, and in his comfortable presence we did rejoice, that we were counted worthy to suffer for truth's testimony. The Sd. of the 5th. month we sailed for Plymouth, but came not to an anchor: the captain went on shore, and we sent a letter to a friend of ours at Plymouth, but received no answer. The next day we sailed for Brest again, being more than forty sail in company, and the ship we were in, and another, went to the mouth of the harbour, and took a ship going in loaded with salt, and lay off from Ushant waiting for the French fleet, until our hopes of getting clear from them was almost spent. At another time they sent for me to make points for reefing the fails, which I refusing to do, some mocked and scoffed, while others filled with envy and malice, could scarce keep their hands from me: and thus we passed through many deep exercises, looking every day when we should receive stripes, and sometimes could see no∣thing but death before us, but the Lord
<PB N="16" REF="038519_0014_101229340F01F6F8"/>wrought deliverance for us in his own way and time, beyond our expectation, and hath been near for our preservation, blessed be his great name therefor.</P>
<P>The 14th. of this month we sailed to Brest to spy what shipping there was in the harbour, and we went so near in, that the French fired many guns at us from the castle. I and my companion Thomas Anthony sat then between decks, not knowing how soon it might be our lots to be shot; my companion not being well at that time nor for several days before, the doctor sent his mate in kindness to enquire if he wanted any thing he had that he should have it, but he refused taking any thing from him, altho' he acknowledged his kindness. The 20th. of this month we sailed for Brest again, and being becalmed, we thought we must come to an anchor, which if we had it might have gone hard with us; but after some time there sprang up a breeze of wind, and we got away from the French, and a few days after we sailed for England again, and got into Plymouth harbour.</P>
<P>So on the 27th. of this month as soon as we came to an anchor, the captain sent for us
<PB N="17" REF="038519_0015_10122937009A8E68"/>into the cabbin, and being before him, he said he would let us go on shore, to see our friends, and refresh ourselves, which he did: so being on shore, and it being meeting day we went to the meeting, although in a poor dirty condition by reason of our lying on board so long, and no cloaths to shift us, ha∣ving been on board about six weeks. Friends were glad to see us on shore, and kindly recei∣ved us into their houses. The first friends house we went to was Henry Cane or Crane who was very kind to us, and provided things ne∣cessary for us. And Daniel Zachary the owner of the vessel we were pressed out of, had wrote to a friend of Plymoth to take care of us when we came on shore, also a friend of London that was appointed by their mornings meeting, sent a letter to a friend of his at Plymoth, to help us to what necessaries we stood in need of, and he would pay him again, which he did; also said friend spoke to the captain twice about setting us at liberty. Since we were not men for his purpose, the captain said he gave us leave to go on shore, but said nothing of our coming on board again, saying he could not answer discharging us, because he was under the command of the flag.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="038519_0016_101229390A7039D8"/>
So having well refreshed ourselves, and were provided with necessaries we travelled through several towns, as Exeter, Bristol, Bath, and divers others, till we came to London, when there we lodged at our friend Thomas Lurtings, and having tarried near four weeks in London, also attended meet∣ings as they came in course pretty constantly. We got a passage to Philadelphia in a vessel commanded by one Joshua Guy, there were divers friends going in her, as John Salkeld and wife, with other passengers. About the 9th. of the 7th. month 1705, we left London, and the vessel fell down to Deal, where my companion Thomas Anthony being taken sick of the small pox, he was put on shore at Deal.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF <HI>RICHARD SELLER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Abstracted from <HI>"A Collection of the Sufferings of the People called Quakers."</HI> Vol. 2. pa. 112, compiled by Joseph Besse, printed in London Anno. 1753 with this remark,—viz.</P>
<Q>The following narrative we have thought proper to insert in the very words of the Sufferer, as taken from his own mouth. The candid reader will easily excuse the simplicity of its style, and the plainness of its expressions: being the more like the man and carrying the greater Evidence of the honesty and integrity of the Relator.</Q>
<P><HI>These are</HI> (says the writer) <HI>the very words that proceeded from him, who sat before me weeping,</HI>—viz.</P>
<P>I WAS pressed in Scarborough-Piers, and refusing to go on board the ketch, they beat me very sore on the sand, and I refusing to go on board, they hoisted me in with a tackle, on board of the ketch that pressed for the ship called the Royal-Prince, and they bunch∣ed me with their feet, that I fell into a tub, and was so maimed, that they were forced to swaddle me up with cloths: from thence we sailed into Bridlington-Bay, where Thomas Swailes and Mary Stranger hearing of me sent me victuals on board the ketch; then we sailed to the Buoy and Nore, where
<PB N="22" REF="038519_0019_1012293FB8611B00"/>they haul'd me in at a gun-port, on board of the ship called the Royal-Prince. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> day of the third month they commanded me to go to work at the capstane; I refused, and told them, that as I was not free to do the king's work, I would not live at his charge for vic∣tuals; then the boatswain's mate beat me sore, and thrusting me about with the cap∣stane till he was weary. Then the Captain sent for me upon the quarter-deck, and asked me, why I refused to fight for the king, and why I refused to eat of his victuals? I told him, I was afraid to offend God, for my warfare was spiritual, therefore I durst not fight with carnal weapons. Then he fell upon me and beat me with his small cane, then called for his great cane, and beat me sore, and felled me down to the deck three or four times, and beat me as long as his strength continued. Then came one Thomas Hor∣ner, (who was brought up at Easington) and said, I pray you, noble captain, be merciful, for I know him to be an honest man, and a good man. Then said the captain, he is a Quaker, I will beat his brains out; then falling on me again, he beat me till he was weary; then called some to help him, for, said he, I am not able to beat him enough to
<PB N="23" REF="038519_0020_10122941C254BDA0"/>make him willing to do the king's service. Then came out the commander's jester, and told the captain, he would lay a guinea with him that he would make me work, and haul the king's ropes, and told the captain he was a fool; so two guineas were thrown down upon the deck, then the jester called for two seamen, and made them make two-ropes fast to the wrists of my arms, and reeved the ropes through two blocks in the mizen∣shrouds, on the starboard-side, and hoisted me up aloft, and made the ropes fast to the gunnel of the ship, and I hung some time; then the jester called the ships company to behold, and bear him witness, that he made the Quaker haul the king's ropes; so veer∣ing the ropes, they lowered me half way down, then made me fast again: now, said the jester, noble captain, you and the company see that the Quaker hauleth the king's ropes, and with that he commanded them to let fly the ropes loose, where I fell upon the deck: now said the jester, noble captain the wager is won, he haul'd the ropes to the deck, and you can haul them no farther, nor any man else. Then the captain called the boatswain's mate, and bid him take the Quakerly-dog away, and
<PB N="24" REF="038519_0021_101229434FD39AF0"/>put him to the capstane, and make him work, and beat him and spare him not. So the boatswain's mate had me down to the geer∣capstane, and thrust me about with the men at the capstane, and beat me withal, when he could get time; then he went and sat him down upon a chest-lid, and I went and sat down upon another chest-lid beside him, then he fell on me and beat me again, then called his boy to bring his two seizings, and he sei∣zed my arms to the capstane's bars, and cau∣sed the men to heave the capstane about, and in three or four times passing about, the seizings were loosed, no man knew how, nor when, nor could they ever be found, al∣though they sought them with lighted candles; then the boatswain's mate, seeing what was done, caused all the men to come from the capstane, and took a bible, and commanded them all to swear, that they neither loosed me, nor knew how I came loose, (they all being willing to swear) he then searched their pockets for the seizings, but could find none, so he let them go; then he called them all again to him, and said, hear what I shall say to you; you see this is a wonderful thing, which is done by an invisible hand, which loosed
<PB N="25" REF="038519_0022_10122946ECE98B18"/>him, for none of you could see his hands loosed, that were so near him: I suppose this man, said he, is called a Quaker, and for conscience-sake refuseth to act, therefore I am afflicted, and do promise before God and man, that I will never beat, nor cause to be beaten, either Quaker, or any other man that doth refuse for conscience-sake to act for the king; if I do, I wish I may lose my right hand.</P>
<P>Then on the third day came the admiral, Sir Edward Spragg, on board of his own ship, called the Royal-Prince, and hearing of a man that was pressed on board, that was called a Quaker; also hearing that the boat∣swain's mate had beaten me much, and had given me over, and had denied to beat me any more, he was therefore called to come before the admiral, to answer for himself, why he would not beat the Quaker? he said, I have beat him very sore, and I seized his arms to the capstane's bars, and forced them to heave him about, and beat him, and then sat down, and in three or four times of the capstanes going about, the seizings were loosed, and he came and sat down by me;
<PB N="26" REF="038519_0023_101229487376E188"/>then I called the men from the capstane, and took them sworn, whether they had loosed him or no, but they all denied that they either loosed him, or knew by what means he was loosed, neither could the seiz∣ings ever be found; therefore I did, and do believe that it was an invisible power that set him at liberty, and I did promise before God and the company, that I would never beat a Quaker again, nor any man else for conscience sake. The admiral told him, he must lose his cane: he willingly yielded it, and told him, he must also lose his place: he was willing. He also told him, he must lose his right hand: he held it out and said, take it from me if you please. So they took his cane from him, and displaced him. So the com∣mander gave order to the seven yeomen, to beat me where ever they met me, for seven days and nights, and make me work: they being called to an account, what they had made me do? told the commander that they were weary, and could not make me work, so they desired to be excused. Then the eighth yeoman was called, who promised he would beat me, and make me work; and he did beat me for a day and a night, when he met with me, and he being weary, he desired
<PB N="27" REF="038519_0024_1012294B465598E8"/>to be excused. Then the commander sent for me upon the quarter-deck before him, and caused my clothes to be stript off, shirt and all, from my waist downward, then he took a view of my body to see what wounds and bruises I had, but he could find none, no not so much as a blue spot on my skin. Then the commander was angry with them for not beating me enough: then captain Fowler answered him and said, I have beat him myself as much as would have killed an ox. The jester said, he had me hung a great while by my arms up aloft in the shrouds. The men said, they had also beat me very fore, and they might as well beat the main-mast. Then said the commander, I will cause irons to be laid upon him during the king's pleasure and mine. Then the boatswain was called, and commanded to call the ship's company together, and make ready the irons: the commander Sir Edward Spragg, said, you gentlemen sailors and soldiers, whosoever serves here under me for the king, on board his Majesty's ship called the Royal-Prince, the admiral of the blue, you are to take notice, that there is a man on board called a quaker, he is to be laid in irons during the king's pleasure and mine, for refusing to fight and
<PB N="28" REF="038519_0025_1012294D5BDEB078"/>eat the king's victuals, therefore I charge you all and every man, that none of you give or sell him any victuals, meat, drink, or water, for if you do, you shall have the same punish∣ment that he hath. So this being called three times over, he commanded the boatswain to take me away and put me in irons. So I being kept in irons six days and nights, and falling sick of a fever, I grew very weak, in∣somuch that when I was set out to case myself, (which was but once in twenty four hours) I could neither stand nor go: so the officers that let me out, called some of my country∣men to carry me into the ship's head to ease myself, and bring me back again to the irons. Then the officer took pity of me, and bid me lay down upon the bilboes that night, and he would hap me with a coverlid, so I lay there that night, and next day till evening; then the officer desired me to go by the way a little, seeing all was quiet, and see if I could get a little rest: so I being lame of a leg with the irons, was creeping over the larboard side of the ship, the lieutenant coming down, said, thou damn'd rogue, (and many other wicked words) hast thou broken the irons? and with that drew his rapier, and swore
<PB N="29" REF="038519_0026_1012294F93C612A0"/>he would stab me, and so drove me back again to the irons, and called the yeomen, and would have known who let me out, and he should be punished, and I would not tell him; but the same yeoman came in the crowd, and I put my hand out to him, and he locked it, and none knew how: I then being the king's prisoner, I bid them begone, they had nothing to do with me: so I remained in irons six days more, and recovered very well of my weak∣ness: then on the seventh day at night, sever∣al, all seamen, fell to drinking of brandy, and playing at cards, and became very loud, the boatswain's mate hearing of them, came down, and desired them to leave off; they being full of drink, would not, so a quarrel arose, and the boatswain's mate cried out murder, and immediately there came assistance to him, but the men ran away and hid themselves, only two were taken, and put in irons with me.</P>
<P>"Now I shall speak a little of the carpenter's mate's Lindness to me; when I had been in irons some days, and my food being taken from me, which was three day's victuals, that I had left of that which Thomas Swales
<PB N="30" REF="038519_0027_10122951A049DA98"/>and Mary Stranger sent me in Bridlington bay, he came in the crowd, and joined him∣self so near me, that he gave me some meat &amp;c. so privately as not to be known to any others; and told me he would supply me daily; for, said he, I have meat of my own, which is not at the king's charge; and said further, that he had a strict charge given him by his wife and his mother, before he came on board, that if any Quaker came on board with him, he should be kind to him; and that he had lately received a letter from them, wherein they charged him to remember his promise, and be kind to the Quakers, if any were on board: but there being some occasi∣on more than ordinary, he was taken off on board, and I had nothing for three days and three nights, and the two men before spoken of, that where in irons with me, while the commander was with us, the men would lie no where but upon me, and as soon as he was gone, they laid off me, and gave me brandy to drink, and promised they would not hurt me: then the lieutenant came at the middle of the night, and found them lying upon me, he asked why they did lie upon me? they
<PB N="31" REF="038519_0028_1012295325B5FDE0"/>said, you would have him kill'd, so now we will kill him for you; then he came down the third time in the morning, and found them lying upon me, for they set one to watch his coming, and he found them lying very close upon me, so that he could see nothing but my feet, I being so pressed and weak, that he could scarce hear my voice.</P>
<P>Then the lieutenant went to Sir Edward's cabbin door, and knocked; the boy answered, who was there? he told him, it was the lieute∣nant who would speak to Sir Edward, for there had been a mutiny in the ship by some men playing at cards, and they had beat the boat∣wain's mate: he told him, he should have laid them in irons, and not called on him. He said, they are already in the bilboes. He also said, if it please your highness Sir Edward, to remember, that there is a poor Quaker in yet, that was laid in two weeks since, and they will lie no where but upon him, and they will kill him for us. He bid him go to the yeomen that had the keys, and take him out of the bilboes, and put up a flag at the mizen∣mast's head and call a council of war;
<PB N="32" REF="038519_0029_10122957256D8B00"/>which was done: then the captains of the other ships all came on board to answer the council of war, before eight o'clock in the morning, (it being the first day of the week) so I being brought before the council of war, the commander asked me, if I would go on board of an hoy that was a tender, and had six guns? I refused, and desired to stay on board, and bear the punishment that I had to abide. Then he bid the council of war go on with their business; so they did proceed, and I being set on a bulk head, being so lame with the irons that I could not stand, and hearing them pass sentence of condemnation upon me. The judge was a Papist, being govern∣or of Dover castle, and went to sea on plea∣sure. So they could not tell at present what death to put me to; the judge said, I should be put into a barrel or cask driven full of nails with their points inwards, and so roll'd to death. But the council of war taking it into consideration, thought it too terrible a death, and too much unchristian-like, so they agreed to hang me: and I hearing them speak seve∣ral things against me, which I was clear of, had a desire to arise from my knees where I was set to answer for myself, but I had not
<PB N="33" REF="038519_0030_10122958AC35B020"/>any power to arise or open my mouth, but was condemned within myself, insomuch that I had not power to breathe unto God; prof∣fering to rise again the second time, there came a motion within me, and bid me be still, be still, be still, three times, which I obeyed and was comforted; then I believed God would arise: and when they had done speak∣ing, then God did arise, and I was filled with the power of God, and my spirit lifted up above all earthly things, and wonderful strength was given me to my limbs, and my heart full of the power and wisdom of God, and with glad tidings my mouth was opened to declare to the people the things which God had made manifest to me: with sweat run∣ning down, and tears trickling from my eyes, I told them, "the hearts of kings were in the hand of the Lord, and so are both yours and mine, and I do not value what you can do to this body, for I am at peace with God and all men, and you my adversaries; for if I might have an hundred and thirty years longer, I can never die in a better condition, for the Lord hath satisfied me, that he hath forgiven me all things in this world, and I am glad through his mercy, that he hath made me
<PB N="34" REF="038519_0031_1012295AEE4156D0"/>willing to suffer for his name's sake; and not only so, but I am heartily glad, and do really rejoice, and with a seal in my heart to the same." Then there came a man and laid his hand upon my shoulder, and said, where are all thy accusers? then my eyes were opened, and I looked about me, and they were all gone; and one said there goeth thy chief friend, the judge: then it arose in my heart, that I had news for him from the power of God, and I said, man come back, I have news for thee better than ever thou heardest in any coffee-house, or elsewhere; and answer for what thou hast done. Then came a lieu∣tenant, and said, Sir. Edward, this is an hypocrite Quaker. I said, commander, I entreat thee to look upon me a little, so I loosed my knee-string and put down my stockings, and let him see how the blood and rotten stuff ran down my leg round about; he said, put up thy stocking, there is enough. Then presently came an antient soldier, and loosed down his knee-strings, and put down his stockings, put his cap under his knees, and begged his pardon three times: then said he, arise up soldier, and speak, and he intreated him and said, "noble Sir Edward,
<PB N="35" REF="038519_0032_1012295C82FDAFA0"/>you know that I have served his majesty un∣der you many years, both in this nation and other nations by the sea, and you were always a merciful man; therefore I do intreat you in all kindness, to be merciful to this poor man, who is condemned to die to-mor∣row, and only for denying your order, for fear of offending God, and for conscience sake; and we have but one man on board out of nine hundred and fifty, but one which doth refuse for conscience-sake, and shall we take his life away? nay, God forbid: for he hath already declared, that if we take his life away, there shall a judgment appear upon some on board within eight and forty hours, and to me it hath appeared, therefore I am forced to come upon the quarter-deck before you, and my spirit is one with his; and there∣fore I desire you in all kindness, when you take his life away, to give me the liberty to go off on board, for I shall not be willing to serve his majesty longer on board of ship: so I do intreat you once more, to be merciful to this poor man: so God bless you, Sir Ed∣ward, I have no more to say to you."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="038519_0033_1012295FA633DC88"/>
Then came the chief gunner, that had been a captain, and loosed down his knee∣strings, and did beg his pardon three times, being upon his bare knees before Sir Edward: then he said, arise up gunner and speak. So he said. "if it please your worship, Sir Edward, we know you are a merciful man, and therefore I intreat you in all kindness, to be merciful to this poor man, in whom there remains something more than flesh and blood, therefore I intreat you, let us not destroy that which is alive, neither endea∣vour to do it: and so God bless you Sir Ed∣ward, I have no more to say to you." Then he went away. Then the commander desired me to go down and take my leave of my friends (this day) that were on board; so he gave orders, that any that had a mind to give me victuals might, and that I might eat and drink with whom I pleased, and that none should molest me that day. Then came the lieutenant, and sat down by me while they were at their worship, and he would have given me brandy, but I refused: then the dinner came up to be served, and several gave me victuals to eat, and I did eat freely, and was kindly entertained that day; then
<PB N="37" REF="038519_0034_101229628D0D8998"/>the night being come, a man kindly proffered me his hammock to lie in that night, because I had lain long in irons, and I accepted of his kindness, and laid me down, and slept well that night. The next morning being come, it being the second day of the week, on which I was to be executed, about eight of the clock in the morning, the rope being reeved upon the mizen-yard's arm, and the boy ready to turn me off, and boats having come on board with captains of other ships that were of the council of war, who came on purpose to see me executed; I was there∣upon called to come to be executed, then I coming to the execution place, the command∣er asked the council, how their judgment did stand? so most of them did consent, and some of them were silent. Then he desired me freely to speak my mind, if I had any thing to say before I was executed: I told him, I had little at present to speak. So there came a man and bid me go forward to be executed, so I stepped upon the gunnel to go towards the rope; the commander bid me stop there if I had any thing to say. Then spake the judge, and said, Sir Edward is a merciful man, that puts that heretick to
<PB N="38" REF="038519_0035_1012296411761F90"/>no worse death than hanging. Sir Edward turned him about to the judge, and said, what saidst thou? I say, replied he, you are a merciful man, that puts him to no worse death than hanging. But, said he, what is the other word that thou saidst, that heretick: I say, said the commander, he is more a christian than thyself; for I do believe thou wouldst hang me, if it were in thy power. Then said the commander unto me, "come down again, I will not hurt an hair of thine head, for I cannot make one hair grow." Then he cried, silence all men, and pro∣claimed it three times over, that "if any man or men on board of the ship would come and give evidence, that I had done any thing that I had deserved death for, I should have it, provided they were credible persons." But no body came, neither opened a mouth against me then. So he cried again, silence all men, and hear me speak: then he pro∣claimed, that the Quaker was as free a man as any on board the ship was. So the men heaved up their hats, and with a loud voice cried, God bless Sir Edward, he is a merci∣ful man: the shrouds, the tops, and decks
<PB N="39" REF="038519_0036_101229668EDB6FB0"/>being full of men, several of their hats flew over board and were lost.</P>
<P>Then I had great kindness shewn me by all men on board, but the great kindness of the Lord exceeded all, for the day I was condemned to die on, was the most joyful day that ever I had in my life-time, and so remained exceeding joyful, until the very time that I was proclaimed a free man. But soon after troubles came upon me again, for I being laid upon the deck one night, as it was my usual lodging-place, there was some∣thing appeared to me, and struck me as it were dead, and I being in great dread and fear, believed our ship was to engage such a day of the month, with the wind at south east, then appeared also a small cloud to me about as big as an hat; after being engaged, the same cloud spread and became a great one, insomuch that it darkened part of the ship, then I stepped over on the starboard∣side of the ship, into the shrouds, and looked aft, and I saw a thick water arising in the wake of the rudder, then I feared the ship was near ground. This appeared to me three times that night, and I would gladly have put it from me, but I could not: then
<PB N="40" REF="038519_0037_1012296996E004A0"/>I did believe, and was satisfied of the truth of it, then I was at peace and quiet in my own mind, but then I was to make it known to the pilot, and I did believe it was death by law to discourage them: so I thought, then I should give them an occasion that they should take away my life; but I could not rest, eat, drink, or sleep, until I had declared it; so I breathed unto God, and desired that he would find me a way to reveal it, so it remaining with me two days and two nights, and being walking upon the deck, and tak∣ing notice of the chief gunner of the ship, I was ordered to go to him, and walk with him; very solitary were both of us, and he perceived I had something to say to him, of some weighty matter, so he desired me to speak my mind to him, and I told him, I had such a weighty matter to declare, that it was death by the law to declare it, I desired that he would stand true to me in that re∣spect, and he promised me fidelity in the presence of God, before whom we were: that he would be true to me in all respects, and if one suffered, both should suffer. Then we espied the mate of the ship walking, he being a sober man, we drew near to him, and
<PB N="41" REF="038519_0038_1012296C0B8DF648"/>he perceived we were both afflicted, and de∣sired to know what was the matter? so we told him, we had a weighty matter, and if he would be as faithful to us, as we were one to another, we would declare it to him: so he promised to be faithful to us, for he did be∣lieve it did concern him: then we told him the matter, and he was fully satisfied of the truth of it; but said he, it doth belong most of all to the pilot; so we must speak to him, and he being such a brittle, high-spirited man, we scarce knew how to speak to him, but cal∣ling him to us, and walking with him, he took notice of our heaviness, and asked our business with him; we told him, we had a matter to declare to him of great concern, therefore we desired him to be faithful to us, and we would declare the matter to him, and he promised to be as faithful to us, as he supposed we were to one another: so they told him the matter, then he asked, who saw it? I told him, I saw it. Then he fell into a rage, and seemed to fly from his promise, and said, he would go and tell the commander, so away he went, and said, he would have me executed speedily: I said, let him go, better I die, than the whole company perish; but they said if thou die, we will all die. Then he
<PB N="42" REF="038519_0039_10122BC31BDC89B0"/>came to us again near weeping, and told us that when he came before the commander, his mouth was stopt, that he could not speak a word good or bad: he was very tender, and praised God that he had such a messenger. Then he took me by the hand, and desired me to tell him the name of the sand, I told him I did not know, I never came there, but at that time I looked up with my eyes, and told him where-abouts the sand laid; so he desired me to go to the compass, and he asked me, if I knew the compass; I told him, very well; so I shewed him upon what point of the compass the said sand laid, and he took a book out of his pocket, and found the sand, and the name of it. Some days after we were engaged on that very point with the Hollanders, and as soon as we were engaged; the cloud appeared to me, and came and darkened the ship, then I stept into the main-shrouds, and I saw the thick water, then I shewed the pilot it, and he called two of the best men to the lead, they cried five fathom and a quarter; then the pilot cried, starboard your helm; then the commander cried, larboard your helm, and bring her too: the pilot said, he would bring the king's ship no nearer, he would give over his charge: the commander cried, bring her
<PB N="43" REF="038519_0040_1012287D52B47B90"/>too. The pilot cried to the leadmen, sing aloud that Sir Edward may hear, (for the out∣cry was very great amongst the officers and seamen, because the ship was so near a-ground, and the enemies upon them) so they cried a quarter less five: the commander cried, we shall have our Royal Prince on ground, take up your charge pilot. Then he cried hard, starboard your helm, and see how our ship will veer; so she did bear round up: the men at the lead cried, five fathom and a better depth; then the commander cried, God pre∣serve the Royal Prince: then the pilot cried, be of good cheer, commander: they cried six fathom, then nine fathom, then fifteen fa∣thom, then sixteen fathom. The Hollanders then shouted, and cried, Sir Edward runs. Then he cried, bring her too again, and the fight continued till the middle of the day was over, and it fell calm: and the ships being engaged on head of us, we could see nothing but fire and smoke; so out of that smoke I espi∣ed a fire-ship designed to lay us on board of the larboard-bow: then I cried to the chief gunner to come to me quickly, and I shewed him the fire-ship coming to board us on the larboard-bow: then he fired a chase gun with a ball in her, and as soon as the smoke was gone from the gun, we espied the fire-ship all
<PB N="44" REF="038519_0041_10122BC71663D3A8"/>on a fire, blown up, and what remained of her sallied on board of the cambridge, and only burned her ensign. The fight continued, and my employ was to carry down the wounded men, and look out for fire-ships, and the com∣mander was mightily pleased with my service, and said, it would have been a great pity that my life should have been taken away before the engagement, and the chief gunner said, I was instrumental, through mercy, not only for gi∣ving notice of the ship coming on ground upon the sand, but also for preventing of the fire∣ship that was near to board us, who gave me the first notice, whereof I am witness. And the lieutenant said to the commander, that there was not a more undaunted man on board except his highness.</P>
<P>Eight days after, we were engaged again with the Hollanders, and the officers sent for me upon the quarter-deck, and asked me what I would do that day? I told them I was wil∣ling to do as I had done before: they desired I would do that service, and take that care upon me, only to look out for fire-ships coming on board; I told them, I was free to do it, likewise to carry down the wounded men if there were occasion; so presently we engaged, but not one fire-ship troubled us that day, but we lost about two hundred men. The lieute∣nant
<PB N="45" REF="038519_0042_10122BC9F8A140E0"/>meeting me, he asked me, if I had recei∣ved any wounds? I told him, I had received none, but was well. He asked me, how came I to be so bloody? then I told him, it was with carrying down wounded men. So he took me in his arms, and kissed me, and that was the same lieutenant that persecuted me so with irons at the first. Then we came to the Buoy and Nore again, and then went up near Chatham, and the king coming on board, the lieutenant desired me to go and walk upon the deck, with him in sight of the king, that haply some might give him notice of me, hoping I might be brought to a trial, and have my li∣berty; but I did not understand that he had any intelligence of me. The next day the same lieutenant came to me, and desired me to walk along with him upon the quarter-deck: I being somewhat unwilling, told him, I did not use to go upon the quarter-deck, unless I was called by the officers: he said, my uncle hath much business, and doth forget you, so walk along with me, I desire you: and I did as he desired me, and he being with me, walked away and left me alone; the command∣er being there, and several captains with him, he came from his company to me, and laid his hand upon my head and said, "thou last done well, and very well too:" so he w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ked by me
<PB N="46" REF="038519_0043_10122BCB8AB75110"/>and I blushed; then he asked me, why I blushed? I told him I desired to know wherein I had done so well: he said, by encouraging them which should have encou∣raged both thee and me. Then said he, thou shalt have thy liberty to go on shore. I asked him, if I might go on shore to re∣cruit, or go to my own being? he said, I should chuse whether I would. I told him I had rather go to my own Being: he said I should do so. Then I told him, there was one thing that I requested of him yet, that he would be pleased to give me a certificate under his hand, to certify that I am not run away: he said, thou shalt have one to keep thee clear at home, and also in thy fishing; for he knew I was a fisherman. So he called the captain, and ordered him to write me a certificate, and bring it to him; which he did with speed, but he did not like it, but slung it him again, and ordered him to make him one more legible; then he brought ano∣ther, and he signed it and gave it me, and wished me well, and said, he desired to hear from me if I got well home, and I told him. I would send him a letter, and so I did: but soon after I got into London, two press∣crews came to me, and said, this is Sir Ed∣wards
<PB N="47" REF="038519_0044_10122BCDE694C520"/>Quaker; you are welcome to shore, will you please to go to the tavern with us? I told them I would not go, nor drink any∣thing; then they wished me well home.</P>
<P>Also they proffered me my pay, before I came off on board, and said, I deserved it as well as any man on board; but I refused, and told them, I had of my own, that I ho∣ped would serve me home. And the lieute∣nant was troubled because I would take nothing; he would have given me twenty shillings, but I would not take it.</P>
<P>Thus ends the <HI>remarkable narrative</HI> of the sufferings of this faithful sailor, who rather than violate his conscience by being instru∣mental to destroy other men's lives, endured with much patience many and sore trials, persevering faithful in his testimony against war and fighting, even near to death; to which he was wholly resigned, and from which he was preserved by a singular providence at∣tending him, in those moments of time which he thought would have been his last. But the virulence of the Popish judge against him as an Heretic, gave the commander, Sir Edward Spragg, who professed himself a
<PB N="48" REF="038519_0045_10122BCFA5F9E4B0"/>Protestant, such disgust, that scorning to be made a tool to execute the vengeance of a Papist in this case, he delivered the innocent man from the death he was condenmed to: Being thus preserved alive, he was made in∣strumental to the saving of the ship, and the lives of many therein: and by the exercise of an undaunted Christian courage and con∣stancy, triumphed over the malice of his ad∣versaries, who, conscious of his innocence, at length became his friends and favourers.</P>
