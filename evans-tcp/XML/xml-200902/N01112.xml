<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a Signal Favour of God to His <HI>People Israel,</HI> that He raised up of <HI>their Sons for Prophets, and of their Young Men for Nazarites.</HI> This has the Lord done for His People in <HI>New-England:</HI> Of which the Author of <HI>this Sermon</HI> is One, and not the Least Instance.</P>
<P>Some of his Friends having desired me to give my Attestation to what is here∣with Emitted, I can with much freedom of Spirit do it: For I have Perused it with great satisfaction. It is Evident that the Author has an Earnest and Holy De∣sire to Promote the Salvation of Souls; Especially of the Young Generation. It is an Happy Omen to a Land, when Young Preachers do so. The Spirit Breathing in this Discourse, Debaseth Man, Exalts Grace, and layes CHRIST

in the Foundation of all. It must needs be a Singular Joy to me, when I see any of those <HI>Scholars</HI> who have sometimes had their Education under me, doing so. And I do the more Rejoyce, in that whereas I did my self Publish Two Sermons on this very Text, Preached in <HI>Cambridge</HI> Twelve Years ago, I see another, and One of my <HI>Academical Children</HI> Concurring in the same De∣sign. I Hope and Pray that as the First Impression of this <HI>Practical Discourse</HI> found General Acceptance, that this <HI>Second E∣dition</HI> of it, will be likewise Blessed to the Spiritual Benefit of many Readers, and add to the Pious Authors Crown <HI>in the Day of CHRIST.</HI></P>

<P>Rejoyce, O Young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy Heart Cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth, and Walk in the Wayes of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes: But Know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into Judgment.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Invaluable worth of Gods Word, may be Argued from the Infinite Excellencies (par∣ticularly the spotless Purity) of the Glorious Author, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.17. It may

also be strongly inferred from the Blessed Effects thereof, 2 Tim 3.15, 16, 17. <HI>And that from a Child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee Wise unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by In∣spiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness: That the Man of God may be Perfect, throughly furnished unto all Good Works.</HI> But they are of special Use to Young Folks, Prov 1.4. They <HI>give Sub∣tilty to the Simple; To the Young Man Know∣ledge and Discretion.</HI> They <HI>Exhort Young Men to be Sober;</HI> And <HI>Teach Young Women to be Sober-minded</HI> also: <HI>Chaste</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> in their Place, Tit. 2 4, 5.6.

In a word, The Sacred Oracles do sufficiently abound with Examples, Pre∣cepts, Exhortations, Motives, Directions, Solemn Warnings, and Severe Reproofs; together with Promises and Threatnings: All which have a direct Tendency to the Reclaiming inconsiderate Youth from the

deadly Evil of a Vain Conversation, and Encouraging them to walk in the New and Living way; that when the Great Judge shall Appear to the shame of others, they may be comforted.</P>
<P>Our Text is a most Pungent Reprehen∣sion of Young Folks, for the Vanity of their Hearts, and Extravagancy of their Lives. It seems plainly to be Levelled a∣gainst the Uncoverted: And they are bid to Solace themselves with Jovial frames in their Pernicious wayes, at their utmost Peril: <HI>Rejoyce O Young Man, &amp;c.</HI> q. d. Well, Vain Youth (seeing thou art set upon it) Trifle away the bright and pleasant Morning of thy short Day; and the Golden Spring-season of that <HI>One Year more</HI> than thou mayest be <HI>let alone</HI> in Gods Vineyard: But yet I Solemnly Declare, (and take notice of what I say) thou shalt for all thy Fleshly Lusts, those of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, be Judg'd Impar∣tially, Condemned Irreversibly, and Pu∣nish'd Eternally: Be it known to the Flesh-pleasing Wanton, that if he WILL Gratify his Youthful Lusts, instead of Fleeing them; whither he will or no, he MUST and SHALL Hear of these things in the Great Audit DAY. But to pre∣vent

all this, will you Open your Hearts to Receive this very Solemn Truth;</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That GOD would have Young People to Know, that if they indulge themselves in Sinful Pleasures, He will call them to an Account for all their Youthful Vanities.</HEAD>
<P>There be Three PROPOSITIONS in the <HI>Doctrine:</HI> [I.] There are many Sin∣ful Pleasures, in which Young People are prone to Indulge themselves. [II.] For all these Youthful Vanities, God will call them to an Account. [III.] This is a Truth, which God would have Young People to Know.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>There are many Sinful Pleasures, in which Young People are prone to Indulge them∣selves.</HI> The very Foundation of our Na∣ture is laid in Corruption, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.5. A Nature not only stained with the Guilt of <HI>Adams</HI> first Sin, who was our Represen∣tative, and in whose Loins we then were; but wholly depraved, and full of the Seeds
<PB N="5" REF="001324_0008_0FB27EC996033D18"/>
of all manner of Sin: which is discovered by the Actions of Little Children. A Stub∣born and Disobedient Heart, must needs be the cause of those cross fits, which are com∣mon to Children before they can speak or go alone. And does not the Pride and Ma∣lice of their hearts appear, in the words and actions even of Sucking Babes?</P>
<P>These Early Fruits of <HI>Pride, Malice, En∣vy, Revenge, &amp;c.</HI> are Actual Sins, tho' of Ignorance. And if they are not against Light, yet neither are they for want of Light; for we find by sad Experience, that as soon as the light begins to discover mo∣ral Good &amp; Evil, it does rather irritate the Corruptions of the heart, and inflame their Desires after forbidden Fruit, than bear down and overcome them. Indeed, the early instructions and restraints of Godly Parents, have no small influence on some Children; not only to prevent the out-breaking of much Evil, but also to the sea∣soning of their Hearts with Grace betimes. Yet how many are there that break all bands &amp; bounds, taking their swinge in all kinds of <HI>Youthful Vanities!</HI> Who as they in∣crease in Dayes &amp; Years, go on from one sinful Pleasure to another; and many, ma∣ny are the wicked Practices that Corrupt

Youth, thro' the Temptations of a Subtil Devil, &amp; an Ensnaring World, are hurried into: Yet not against their will; for the most wicked and deceitful courses are very agreeable to an <HI>Heart deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked,</HI> Jer. 17.9.</P>
<P>I shall undertake to speak particu∣larly of the various wayes of the Hearts of Young Men and Women; only give a few Hints, leaving it with their own Consci∣ences, to tell them more at Large, what have been their several Pleasant Walks, in the Garden of Sinful Delights.</P>
<P>There is the way of <HI>Ʋncleanness;</HI> in Heart, Lip, &amp; Life; with others, or alone: The way of <HI>Lying;</HI> for Sport, or to Excuse their other faults; and sometimes one a∣gainst another, out of meer Malice &amp; Re∣venge. The way of <HI>Pride;</HI> in ambitious, self-conceited thoughts, boasting expressi∣ons, &amp; inordinate imitation of the newest Fashions. In short; There are the ways of <HI>Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Disobedience</HI> to Parents, <HI>Drinking,</HI> &amp; <HI>Stealing,</HI> that are very pleasing in the Eyes of Vain Youth; insomuch, that the wise man does not think it enough in the close of this Chap∣ter to call them Vain, <HI>Childhood and Youth</HI> (saith he) <HI>are Vanity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>For all these Youthful Vanities, God will call Young People to an Account.</HI> When God at first made man, He gave him a Law, to be the Rule of his Life; annexing Promi∣ses and Threatnings to that Holy, Righte∣ous &amp; Good Law. And tho' by our Apostasy, we have rendred our selves unable to keep the Law of God; yet, tis nevertheless bind∣ing; especially to them who have it not only written on their Hearts, as even the Heathen are said to have, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2 14, 15 but more fully, and less darkly in their Bi∣bles; with the addition of the Gospel, by which the Law is Established, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.31. God hath not lost His <HI>Right</HI> to our Obedi∣ence, because we have lost our <HI>Power</HI> of O∣beying: And being Rational Creatures, we must of necessity, be accountable to Him who is our Law-giver and Judge, Rom. 14.10.12. <HI>We shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ. So then every one of us shall give Account of himself to God</HI> Even that GOD <HI>who is ready to Judge the Quick and Dead;</HI> 1 Pet. 4, 5. <HI>i. e.</HI> All that ever have had, or shall have a being in the world, from the First Man <HI>Adam,</HI> to the Last Child that shall be Born. And as this Judgment shall be U∣niversal
<PB N="8" REF="001324_0011_0FB27ECFE76B0C98"/>
with respect to Persons, <HI>viz</HI> Youth as well as Children &amp; Infants below them, and Middle, with Old Age above them; so it shall be Universal with respect to the Works done in the Body, Eccl. 12.14. <HI>For God shall bring every Work into Judgment, with every Secret thing, whether it be Good or Evil.</HI> And surely, Wanton, Proud, Malicious, and all Sinful words, are to be reckoned a∣mong those Works: Not so much as an <HI>I∣dle Word</HI> shall escape the Reckoning Day, <HI>Mat</HI> 12.36 Yea, God knows all the wicked &amp; <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> of men, <HI>Job</HI> 42.2. <HI>Psal</HI> 94.11. And does most certainly keep an exact Account of them; and will call to a strict Reckoning for them, on that Day, when <HI>the Small as well as the Great shall stand be∣fore God; and the Books being Opened, they shall be Judged one of those things that are written in the Books, according to their works,</HI> Rev. 20.12. Nor should the distance of this Great Day make it less awful to any of us: For there will be a Day of Particu∣lar Judgment, which shall unalterably de∣termine our Final &amp; Everlasting Estate, as soon as our Souls are separated from our Bodies, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27. Which may be the case of the Youngest of us all, within a very few Dayes or Hours; before the next Sabbath,
<PB N="9" REF="001324_0012_0FB27ED3453776E8"/>
yea, before we see the light of another Day. And truly the General Judgment may be nearer than we imagine. The Lord may come unlook'd for, &amp; surpriz Young Ones in the midst of their Carnal Mirth &amp; Jollity, before they are aware, <HI>to cut them asunder, and appoint them their Portion with Hypocrites, who shall for ever weep, wail, and gnash their teeth,</HI> Mat. 24 48, — And as Young Folks are wilful &amp; uncontroleable in their Wickedness; resolved that the Lord shall not Rule over them: whom all the Commands, Promises &amp; Threatnings of the Law and Gospel can nothing move; and with whom all the means &amp; methods that God is using, are altogether ineffectual for their reclaming: So it shall be as fruit∣less for them to use any Endeavours for an Escape from Gods Tribunal: Heb 2.3. <HI>How shall we Escape, if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI> As <HI>there is no darkness nor shadow of Death, where the workers of Iniquity may hide them∣selves</HI> from the presence of God <HI>Now, Job</HI> 34 22. so it shall be utterly in vain for them <HI>Then,</HI> to say to the <HI>Mountains &amp; Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of Him that sits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;</HI> when the Great Day of His intolerable Wrath is come, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.16, 17.
<PB N="10" REF="001324_0013_0FB27ED581000310"/>
Thus, because Young Men will indulge themselves in Sinful Pleasures, GOD will call them to an Account for all their Youthful Vanities.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>This is a Truth which GOD would have Young People to Know.</HI> Young Men <HI>Re∣joyce in their Youth,</HI> as if they were made for nothing but Merriment; and their <HI>Hearts Chear them in the Days of their Youth,</HI> just as if it were alwayes to be Spring-time with them. They can Read, and Medi∣tate on the former part of our Text with Delight. How pleasing is the Counsel, in the sense their wanton Hearts would have it taken in? Words could scarce fit them better. <HI>Walk in the ways of thine Heart, &amp; in the sight of thine Eyes:</HI> This is what they would have! But God would have them to Read, and solemnly to Consider the whole Verse. They must take this stinging <HI>BƲT</HI> with the rest; <HI>Know thou, that for all these things, God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>For the further Illustration of this Third <HI>Proposition,</HI> it may be Enquired, What it is for Young Men to Know this Truth? Why God would have them to know it And,
<PB N="11" REF="001324_0014_0FB27ED9107C0438"/>
Whence it is that they are so Unwilling to Know it?</P>
<P>Quest I. <HI>What is it for Young Men to Know this Great Truth?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. In Gen.</HI> It is more than barely to Know that such a Truth is written in their Bibles: It is to Realize the Truth of it, and to Think much upon it. Yea, it is to Know (as the word in Scripture, frequent∣ly signifies,) so as to be <HI>Affected</HI> with it &amp; to act accordingly. For Vain Youth to Know, that for all these things they must come to Judgment, in the sense of our <HI>Text,</HI> is for them to Know it, not only Notionally, with a Speculative, Barren, Unpractical Know∣ledge; but Feelingly, with a Knowledge that is Heart-affecting and Operative.</P>
<P>More Particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>For Young Men to Know aright, is for them firmly to Believe the Truth of this. All-concerning Doctrine, of a Judgment to come.</HI> To Realize it to themselves, that they must certainly, and may quickly Dye: For God often shortens the dayes of them who are <HI>Wicked Overmuch,</HI> and <HI>Foolish, Eccl</HI> 7.17▪ Those who indulge themselves in Youthful Lusts often Dye in Youth, <HI>Job</HI> 36.14. And <HI>after Death comes the Judgment,</HI> Heb 9.27. To Know aright, is to Believe all this; and
<PB N="12" REF="001324_0015_0FB27EDDC62420D8"/>
further, to Realize the Second Coming of Christ to Judgment; when <HI>He shall Descend from Heaven, with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God;</HI> whose Voice shall Raise the Dead, 1 <HI>Thes</HI> 4.16. And that when <HI>He comes with Clouds, E∣very Eye shall see Him; and those also who Pierced Him;</HI> — (Have not Young men done so by their Sins?) <HI>And all the Kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of Him,</HI> Rev. 1.7 Neither shall so much as one Proud, Un∣chast, Disobedient, or Vain Thought, Word or Action, escape Unaccounted for, in that Day of Reckoning. Thus to Know is mote than to Hear and Read these things; It is to Believe and Realize them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>For Young Men to Know this Truth, as they should, is for them with frequency and seriousness of Soul, to Consider of it.</HI> It's not enough to Believe, that, if we indulge our selves in Sin, God will Judge and Condemn us for our Sins; but we must take it into solemn Consideration: If it be an Article of our <HI>Faith,</HI> it must be the Subject of our <HI>Meditation.</HI> We should be often thinking of, and with the greatest seriousness Re∣volving in our minds, this Eternal Con∣cern of our Souls. Hence we find Know∣ing and Considering frequently joyned to∣gether
<PB N="13" REF="001324_0016_0FB27EDF43B12508"/>
in Scripture; Thus, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 25.17: and Isa. 1.3. <HI>Israel does not Know. My Peo∣ple do not Consider.</HI> Not to Consider of this Truth, is not to Know it aright. Again, Isa. 41.20. <HI>That they may See, and Know, &amp; Consider.</HI> So that when God bids Young Men Know, what the Latter End of a Vain Life will be, He would have them to take it into most serious Consideration: And it will be their wisdom so to do, Deut. 32.29. <HI>O that they were Wise; that they Ʋn∣derstood this; that they would Consider their Latter End!</HI> And not only to Consider what it shall be; but withal to think how they shall be able to hold up their heads in that Day! What they shall have to say for themselves! How they can bear to hear (and yet hear they must) that dreadful Sentence, <HI>Go ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> And further, to consider what it will be to lie in Hell among Devils, and Damned Men and Women for ever! And thus to con∣sider would affect their Hearts; which also is included in Knowing aright. But this brings us to the Third Particular, under the First Enquiry.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>For Young Men to Know the Great Truth before us in the sense of our Text, is for them
<PB N="14" REF="001324_0017_0FB27EE0C1A07160"/>
to be deeply Affected with it, and Concerned a∣bout it. To Know,</HI> is in this sense also fre∣quently taken in Scripture: Thus, 1 King. 8.38 Job 13.23. <HI>Make me to Know my Transgression and my Sin.</HI> And yet nearer to the present purpose, does that fervent Prayer of Holy <HI>David</HI> seem to be, Psal. 39.4. <HI>Make me to Know mine End,</HI> i. e. so as to lay it to heart. It was an Affectionate Know∣ledge that he there desired. So Ezek 16 2. <HI>Cause Jerusalem to Know her Abominations.</HI> God would have her to lay to Heart her Sins; to be deeply Affected with them, and Sorrowful for them, when he speaks of her Knowing them. So that, <HI>Know thou, &amp;c.</HI> in our Text, is as much as if God had said, And wilt thou indeed, Vain, Foolish Young Man? — Art thou resolved to wallow in the mire of Sin? Then I would have thee to <HI>Know,</HI> by Believing and Considering, — Yea, let it sink into thy Heart, and fill thy Soul with trembling, that I will most sure∣ly, and shortly too, call thee to a most strict and solemn Account, for all thy <HI>Youthful Vanities;</HI> and thou shalt find them to be Dear bought Pleasures: — And if Young Men did know this Great Truth thus <HI>Af∣fectionately,</HI> they would soon come to know it <HI>Practically</HI> which is the Fourth &amp; Last
<PB N="15" REF="001324_0018_0FB27EE24094B268"/>
Thing intended in this right Knowledge, of which we are speaking.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>To Know this Truth aright is to Know it Practically.</HI> For <HI>Young Men to Know, that if they indulge themselves in Sinful Plea∣sures, God will call them to an Account for all their Youthful Vanities,</HI> is for them to act as men who do Realize the Truth hereof; as those who have frequently taken it into serious Consideration, laid it to Heart, and have been deeply Affected with it. This, in General, is to Know the Truth before us Practically, even to Practice ac∣cording to such a Knowledge.</P>
<P>But, more Particularly.</P>
<P>This Practical Knowledge includes, or comprehends these Three things in it; viz <HI>Faith, Repentance,</HI> and <HI>New Obedience.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Know this Truth Practically, is to be driven thereby out of our selves, to JESƲS CHRIST in the way of Faith.</HI> When the Young Man does consider, that he has been a great Sinner; this or that gross Sin his Conscience charges him with; and he hears God calling, as it were from Heaven to him, and saying, O Vain Young Man! I will shortly reckon with thee for all thy Sinful Delights: I have them every one written down in my Book. Being deeply affected
<PB N="16" REF="001324_0019_0FB27EE7D8F9C898"/>
herewithal (which we supposed under the Third Particular) he looks about him for a way of Escape; saying within-himself, How shall I avoid this terrible Account, with the dreadful Condemnation and Eternal Mise∣ry that is Consequent thereon? As the Jaylor, Act 16 30 <HI>What must I do to be Saved?</HI> And now, if the Lord in His Free Love &amp; Infinite Mercy save from flying to the strong Hold of Self-Righteousness for Safety, which is as natural and common, as it is dangerous and fatal I say, if it please God, by such a word as that, Isa. 64.6. <HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags;</HI> to discover the Vanity hereof; and withal, to make discovery of JESUS CHRIST as the Only &amp; Alsufficient Saviour, Act. 4 12 <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other; for there is no other Name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be Saved.</HI> And as there <HI>Is</HI> no other Saviour, so there <HI>Needs</HI> no other: <HI>For He is Able to Save to the uttermost, all that come unto God by Him; seeing He ever lives to make Intercession for them,</HI> Heb. 7.25. Who came into the world to Ransom lost Souls from Sin and Wrath, <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.21. <HI>Job.</HI> 6.38. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.10. Whose Arms are always open to receive all that come aright unto Him, how vile soever they have been.
<PB N="17" REF="001324_0020_0FB27EE9C45C60F8"/>
Who never did nor will He, <HI>in any wise cast out such as do come,</HI> Joh. 6 37 Then the Poor, Convinced, Trembling Sinner, is Enabled by the mighty Power of God (even the Exceeding Greatness of that Power where∣by Christ was raised from the Dead, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19) to consent that Christ shall be his Saviour, and to accept of Him on his own Terms: And this is true Faith, Joh. 1.12. <HI>Put to as many as Received Him, to them gave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to become the Sons of God; even to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Believed on His Name.</HI> And this is Practically to Know the Great Truth contained in our Text; and when we come thus to Know it, we Know it as God would have us to do; whose very end in laying before us the danger of those Sin∣ful Ways in which we have been walk∣ing, is to drive us to Christ, by whom a∣lone we may Escape that danger. Thus to Believe in Christ, is Practically to Know the Truth in hand: which in the First Thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Next thing included in a Practical Knowledge of the Truth before us, is Repentance.</HI> This Grace never fails to follow or rather to accompany Saving Faith But to imagine that Godly Sorrow for Sin goes before Faith, is the dangerous mistake of many poor Souls, who think they must mourn for sin
<PB N="18" REF="001324_0021_0FB27EEB431F7040"/>
to fit them for Christ; and when they think they have so done, they hope Christ will accept of them; and to Him they go; (if it might be called going to Christ;) but with the Young Man in the Gospel, <HI>too full of themselves to have any room left for Jesus Christ,</HI> Mat. 19.20. Its true, a Soul must be Humbled before it can Believe, but that Humiliation which goes before Faith, has not a drop of Godly Sorrow for Sin in it. No, it consists rather in the sense of an hard Heart, that can't mourn for Sin; yea, that is empty of all Good, and full of nothing but Sin; unworthy of the least crumb of Mercy, so much as to be stayed from going down to the Pit for one single Day. So that the Humbled Soul comes to acknowledge, (and how Evident is it?) that nothing but Free Grace can help it. Yea, after all its Sighs &amp; Groans, and ear∣nest Cries for Mercy, if God should kick it away from His Footstool (where it lies prostrate, with its mouth in the Dust) into the Bottomless Pit, yet God is Righteous! This is that Humiliation which goes be∣fore Faith: But brokenness of Heart for Sin follows after: To our sense, feeling &amp; observation it does so; tho' it does really accompany faith, being infused with it
<PB N="19" REF="001324_0022_0FB27EECC036AC18"/>
into the Penitent Believing Soul. Thus tis a sense of the Love of God in Christ to a most vile, wretched Sinner, that breaks the Heart, fills it with shame and sorrow; yea quite melts it down into Penitential Tears, which now at the first discovery of the Everlasting Love of GOD, the Father of Mercies, thro' a sweet JESUS, do flow free∣ly from that newly Created Principle of Life in the Soul, as Waters from a Living Spring. Search the Scriptures, and see if it be not so? Ezek. 16 63. <HI>That thou mayest Remember and be Confounded, and never Open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.</HI> Mark the Con∣vexion; <HI>Then ashamed, when I am pacified.</HI> You know that without (or, which is all one, before) Faith, it is impossible to please God, (<HI>Heb</HI> 11.6) by Repentance or any act of Obedience: But being United to Christ by Faith, the Soul derives Vertue &amp; Strength from the full Fountain of Life, to mourn for Sin, even all Sin, as the greatest Evil; as against GOD and CHRIST. Oh, that ever I should offend &amp; grieve a GOD so Good, whom I now see to be my Loving Friend &amp; Father in Christ! And He Loved me, while I was polluted in my Blood▪ and
<PB N="20" REF="001324_0023_0FB27EF579D4D710"/>
kicking against His Bowels, Ezek. 16 6, 8. <HI>And when I passed by thee, &amp; saw thee polluted in thine own Blood, I said unto thee, Live: — And thy time was the time of Love.</HI> 1 Joh. 4.19. <HI>We Love Him because He first Loved us.</HI> Ungrateful Wretch that I am! that ever I should make the Lord of Angels, to stand and knock at the Door of my Heart, <HI>til His Head was filled with Deu &amp; His Locks with the Drops of the Night,</HI> Cant. 5.2. And all this after He had Loved me, and Dyed for me, that He might wash me from my Sins in His own Blood! Thus the Soul melts, when Christ speaks Peace, by the sweet still Voice of His Spirit. And this is true Repentance, taken in a more restrained sense; for largely taken it includes New Obedience; and Faith also is necessarily implied in it: But we are speaking of these Graces distinctly; and New Obedi∣ence is the Third and Last thing compre∣hended in this Practical Knowledge.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Saving Faith, &amp; that Repentance which is unto Life, will be fruitful in Good Works.</HI> The Soul that has tasted the bitterness of Sin, cannot now drink in Iniquity like Wa∣ter, as heretofore it has done.

testifying his Thankfulness by Sincere, Con∣stant and Universal Obedience. He will not allow himself in the Omission of any known Duty: his failings &amp; short comings, backwardness to, and Spiritual Deadness in Duty, is a Burden which rather than any thing in the World, he would get rid of. And he is still endeavouring to press forward. All that he has Done he thinks not worth looking on; he does as it were forget it, thro' the earnest Desire that he has to those things which are before; even those further Degrees of Obedience, which he presses after, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.13, 14. And this is New Obedience; and this is Practically to Know the Great Truth before us; And thus would God have Young Men to Know it; Eccl. 12.13, 14. <HI>Fear God, and keep His Commandments, — For God shall bring every Work into Judgment, with every secret thing; whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</HI> Seeing we look for Christs coming to Judg∣ment, <HI>what manner of Persons ought we to be, in all Holy Conversation and Godli∣ness?</HI> Thus much in Answer to the First <HI>Question.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. II. <HI>Why would God have Young Men to Know that they must come to Judg∣ment?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001324_0025_0FB27EF9AD031628"/>Answ. 1. <HI>That so they may Live and be to His Glory.</HI> Vain Youths do nothing but Dishonour God, before they come to the Knowledge, of which we have been speak∣ing. Now, this Vain, Ungodly Life, is quite beside, and contrary to the great End for which we are Made, Preserved and Re∣deemed. But the thorough Knowledge of this Truth, would set us upon Glorifying God; and this is one great reason why God would have us to Know it. But they who are most concerned in this Text and Doctrine, cannot, as yet, feel the strength of such a Motive. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord Respects our own Everlasting Good and Advantage herein.</HI> He looks down from Heaven and sees the Generality of Young Men and Women merrily posting along the Broad Way that leads to De∣struction and Eternal Damnation, and out of Pity &amp; tender Compassion He calls after them to make a stop, and seriously to Con∣sider whither they are going, and what the End of this Course will be? Whether it would not be better for them to turn quite about, and to get in at the Strait Gate, &amp; walk on in the Narrow Way, tho' some∣thing more Difficult, since it leads to Ever∣lasting Life and Glory? Mat. 7.12, 14.
<PB N="23" REF="001324_0026_0FB27EFB0AEA1528"/>
<HI>Enter ye in at the Strait Gate, for Wide is the Gate, and Broad is the Way that leadeth to Destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because Strait is the Gate, &amp; Narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</HI> Thus God Blessed for ever, who can no wise be profited by His Creatures, would have us Know this Truth for our own Good, Job 5.27. &amp; 22.2.</P>
<P>Quest. III. <HI>Whence is it, that Young Men are so unwilling to Know, that they must come to Judgment; and their Hearts and Lives be Exposed to Publick View then?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>It is partly thro' the Temptations of Satan, their Potent, Subtil and Malicious adversary.</HI> This Roaring Lion makes it his business to devour Souls, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8. And he knows that if he can keep the thoughts of Death, Judgment and Eterni∣ty cut of the minds of Young People, he shall obtain his Ends. And great is the Advantage, and many are the Devices that he has to take Young Ones off from the Consideration of their Latter End, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.11. He will tell them, its too soon yet; they may delay a little longer: He makes some believe that Religion is attended with innumerable &amp; insuperable Difficul∣ties: O how harshly will the Devil repre∣sent
<PB N="24" REF="001324_0027_0FB27EFC9F20F2C8"/>
a Godly Life to them! And on the o∣ther hand, How will he set forth the Plea∣sures of Sin! He knows how to bait his hook, according to the Constitutions, Call∣ings &amp; present Employment of <HI>Young People.</HI> And if he cannot <HI>Wholly</HI> shut out Religion, he will perswade them that <HI>a Little</HI> is E∣nough. If they comply with some Duties, why may they not be excused as to others, that have more of Self-denial in them? Or if they take up with the whole <HI>Form of God∣liness,</HI> without <HI>the Power of it,</HI> he has them fast still: If they have had some sad thot's about their Sins, he will make that pass with them for thorough Repentance; and a Vain Confidence to be saved by the Blood of Christ (tho' never washed in that Foun∣tain; nor heartily sensible of their Need, yea &amp; extream Necessity of being sprink∣led with it every Day) for true Justifying Faith: And if they have some good wishes, and external performances, this, saith the Father of Lies, is true Gospel Obedience. If he can't get them to be openly Profane, they may be prevailed with to be Secret∣ly Wicked; and one Sin lived in, loved &amp; allowed of (he knows) will Effectually undo them. He may sometimes for bear Tempting to Grosser Immoralities, lest
<PB N="25" REF="001324_0028_0FB27F0543BF2310"/>
their False Peace should be disturbed, and so his strongest Hold weakned. But who can trace this Old Subtil Serpent? Thus, its partly from the Devil and Satan.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Its partly also through the Evil Exam∣ples and Solicitations of wicked Companions.</HI> And how prevalent are Evil Examples! It is exceeding natural for us to be drawn a∣way thereby: Why else is that Prohibition given, Exod. 23.2. <HI>Thou shalt not follow a Multitude to do Evil?</HI> Sad Experience assures us that it is too true with respect to the present Rising Generation. Young Men do see, that, for the most part, those who are Young like themselves do take their swing in Youthful Vanities, and are little con∣cerned about the Practical Knowledge of the Truth in hand, so as to Believe, Repent, and Obey the Gospel. If some few are in good earnest for Religion they are Ob∣jects of Scorn, as too Precise, if not down∣right Hypocrites. But this is not all; the Devils Children will Tempt one another; and draw by Solicitations as well as Ex∣ample. They will urge for a Combination in wickedness, Prov. 1.13, 14. <HI>We shall find all precious Substance: Cast in thy Lot with us.</HI> Prov. 7.22, 23. <HI>With much fair speech she cau∣sed him to yield; with the flattering of her lips
<PB N="26" REF="001324_0029_0FB27F072314E178"/>
she forced him: He goeth after her straight∣way, as an Ox goeth to the slaughter, or a Fool to the Correction of the stocks; till a Dart strike thro' his Liver; as a Bird hasteth to the snare, &amp; knoweth not that it is for his Life.</HI> And Oh! How hard is it for a Poor Grace∣less Young Man or Maiden, (tis of and to such I am speaking) to withstand these pleasing Solicitations! And how many are undone for ever by Evil Company! Yet others won't take warning. Thus, you see Satan is not the only Destroyer of men! They prove, as it were, Devils to one a∣nother. It is much thro' the Evil Exam∣ples &amp; Perswasions of Companions in Sin that this truth is unknown, unthought of.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is partly also, yea principally from them∣selves, that Young Persons come short of their Duty, while they rush into Sin.</HI> The hearts of Vain Youths are naturally full of Enmity against God, and therefore cannot be sub∣ject to His Law, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 7. We have hearts by Nature <HI>bent to Evil, only to Evil, &amp; that continually,</HI> Gen. 6.5. There are many Youthful Lusts that keep multitudes from knowing the things that belong to their Peace, in the day of them: Gen. 8.21. <HI>The imagination of mans Heart is Evil from his Youth.</HI> Were it not for Inward Corruption,
<PB N="27" REF="001324_0030_0FB27F088651F350"/>
it would be easy to resist and repel the as∣saults of Temptation. We are for the most part, of our selves inclined to do that which Satan &amp; Others tempt us to. Thus by <HI>our own Lusts, we are enticed and drawn away,</HI> Jam. 1.14. Our worst Enemy is in our <HI>own Bosoms,</HI> conspiring with Satan in shed∣ding the <HI>Blood of our precious and immortal Souls!</HI> This may be Written on the Graves of all those Vain Youths that go on and Dye in their Sins, Hos. 13.9. <HI>Thou hast Destroyed thy self.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Begin with Consideration. Commune with your own Hearts,</HI> Psal. 4.4.

Consideration is the First step towards Conversion; Psalm 119.59. <HI>I thought on my ways, and turned my Feet unto thy Testimonies.</HI> The Prodigals return be∣gan here, Luk. 15.17. <HI>And when he came to himself, he said within himself, How many hired Servants of my Fathers have Bread enough and to spare, and I Perish for Hunger: I will arise now and go to my Father:</HI> If men were once come to themselves, they would no longer act like men beside themselves: And it is by Serious Consideration, that we must be brought to our right mind.

Be perswaded then to follow this Direction, you that are Young, if it were but a Quarter of an Hour in a Day, to set fix∣edly on this work; and, one would think, that were a small matter to do for a Good God, and a Precious Soul. Some, I hope, will do more, but, Oh! that others might be brought thus far; even to think seri∣ously on ETERNITY, or some other a∣wakening Subject for one Quarter of an Hour in a Day: Better think of it now than in Hell, where the Consideration of Endless Eternity, does more than double their present misery. Oh! Little did I think (says a Damned wretch to himself) that it would come to this! Oh! That I had but Considered my ways, while I was in the way, before I came to this Endless End! Why thou that Readest these Lines, mayest answer the Call of God, Hag. 1.5. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Consider your Wayes.</HI> The great advantage of Consideration is this, that it represents things, both past &amp; future, as present. Thus the Convinced Sinner does think with himself; Such and such a Sin I committed so many Dayes, Months, or Years past, and then it troubled my Conscience for the present, but <HI>because Sentence was not speedily Executed, therefore

But now I see my Sins all to stand in the Light of His Countenance; and an once provoked God is as angry with me still for those unrepented of Abominations that I long ago committed, as if I were now in the very act. On the other hand; Con∣sideration looks forward, and brings pale Death, that King of Terrors, and the cold Grave, that dark, silent House within plain view. Suppose thou wert now on thy Sick-bed given over by the Physicians, and thy sorrowful Friends weeping at thy Bed-side, and taking thee by the cold hand, while thou art gasping for Life: Yea, Suppose thy self a Dead Corpse, nailed up in a Coffin, carried on the Shoulders of men to the Pits brink; then lowered down into the Grave, ready to shut her mouth upon thee; the Worms soon feeding upon thy Body; and thy Soul, in the mean time, appearing Naked before thousands of An∣gels, that always attend Christ the Judge: and so go on to the Resurrection, &amp; last Ge∣neral Judgment; and by fixed Consideration thou mayest bring all these things as it were before thine Eyes: and by this first step thou wilt be prepared to go on in the use of all other means of Grace.

But rather get alone, and begin with (the Practice of the First Counsel) Consideration: Realize it to you selves, when alone, that there is a Heaven of un∣conceiveable Glory above, and an Hell of unutterable Torment below; and think with your self, In one of these places, I must be as long as the ETERNAL has a Being: and that according as I improve, or mis∣pend my time here, even that little inch of fleeting time, that God may yet indulge me withal. And so go on from <HI>Conside∣ration</HI> to <HI>Prayer,</HI> and the other foremen∣tioned Means and Directions. Beg of God of Bless these Counsels to you, as knowing how soon you will forget them, and how certainly neglect to put them in practice, if left to your self. Improve <HI>Sab∣baths</HI>

especially; Pray hard for Converting Grace, before, in, and after every Sermon you hear: Thus, <HI>Seek the Lord while He may be found, Call on Him while He is near,</HI> Isa 55.6. Truly Repent, and <HI>God will a∣bundantly Pardon,</HI> ver. 7. Only remember, in must be NOW God will have it so: <HI>Thus saith the Lord, return ye Now every man from his Evil way,</HI> Jer. 18.11. <HI>To Day, if you will hear His Voice,</HI> Heb. 3.7. But not one Promise in the whole Bible that assures you, if you seek To-morrow you shall find: but on the contrary, tis said in Prov. 1.24, 28▪ <HI>Because I have Called, and ye Re∣fused, — Therefore shall they Call on Me, but I will not Answer. No time like the Pre∣sent:</HI> Now or Never.</P>

<P>Finally. <HI>When you have done all that may or can be done, before or after Conversion, Re∣nounce all your own Righteousness as Eiliby Rags, in Point of Justification; Casting your selves at the Foot of Christ, waiting for Mercy, Free Mercy; Pleading only the Merit of Christs Blood, and your own Wretched Helpless Circumstances.</HI> I would solemnly Advise, Intreat and Warn you to beware of put∣ing

Duties, Endeavours, and moving Af∣fections in the room of CHRIST: Oh! When we are warm and lively in any Du∣ty, and then find something within us, saying, as it were, unto us, Now thou hast done well; now God will love, accept of, and save thee! Let us Reject all such mo∣tions of Spiritual Pride; — and say with our selves, God might justly Damn me for the many Sins of this Duty, if I had none other; — Yea, for this particular Sin of Privy Pride, that has now been stirring in my Heart. <HI>God be Merciful to me a Sinner,</HI> is more becoming Language, for a vile Lump of Corruption, than, <HI>God I thank thee, I am not as other men, &amp;c.</HI> Come as with a Rope about thy Neck and say;</P>

I have Affronted thee to thy Face: I have Deserved Hell a Thousand times over: I have made nothing of Abusing thy Kindness, and grieving thy Spirit, and kicking against the tenderest Bowels of thy Love: tis a Wonder of Wonders that I am out of Hell! Much more, that I should be once more invited to come to thee for Pardoning Mercy! LORD, I come at thy Call, and am ready to Subscribe any Terms; Only give me Grace to perform them; and all for the sake of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> more Honoured thee by His

Righteousness, than any Sinner ever Dishonoured thee by his Iniquity; So that thou can'st loss nothing by Receiving me to Mercy!</HI></P>
<P>Thus READER, With-draw thy self, when thou hast finished a few Lines more; and Throwing thy self down in the Dust, Address the Throne of Grace, in behalf of thy Poor, Perishing Soul; and never fear: — It shall never be said, that the Compassionate JESUS, the Merciful King of <HI>Israel,</HI> who Pray'd and Dy'd for His very Murderers; did yet, after He had spared thee in thy Re∣bellion so long, at last take the advan∣tage to hang thee up, as a Monument of His Wrath when thou hast thus put thy self into His Hands, Joh. 6.37. <HI>Him that Cometh to me, I will in no wise Cast out.</HI> Only, since Christ hath so long waited on <HI>Thee,</HI> be willing to seek and wait a little while for <HI>HIM:</HI> Cant. 3.4. <HI>It was but a Little that I passed from them, but I found Him.</HI> And having once found Him, He is thine for Ever: And having CHRIST, thou Possessest All Things: Thou can'st Desire no more, Col. 3.11. <HI>CHRIST IS ALL.</HI></P>
