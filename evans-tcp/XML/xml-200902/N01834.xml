<P>THE BOOK OF THE REVELATION of Jesus Christ, Which GOD gave unto him, to shew unto his Servants things which were to come to pass; and <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> sent and signifyed it by his Angel to his Servant <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>And now by Revelation, hath opened the Mystery contained in said Book unto his Servant <HI>JOHN ROGERS,</HI> Who hath explained the same for the Edification and Comfort of His Church and People, after a long and dark Night of Apostacy; the Explanation being made so plain, that the eye of every Spiritual Reader may see how exactly things have come to pass, as they were foretold of by the Prophecy of this Book: And may see by it all things which are yet to come, not only to the end of this World, but to the finishing of the World to come.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>THE Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John,</P>
<P>Who was required to write them in a Book and to send it to the seven Churches of Asia, as in <HI>v.</HI> 11. Accordingly John attended his order, as appears <HI>v.</HI> 4.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. Who bear record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophesie, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand.</P>
<P>In this third verse there is a blessed Promise, both to the reader and hearer of the prophesie of this Book, when they
<PB N="2" REF="002172_0003_0FBC79F142C14AB0"/>take heed to keep those things which are written therein; which Verse shews it is not a seal'd Book but may be read and understood by God's Church, tho' fast seal'd up and not to be understood by the false Church, as appears, Isai. 29.11, &amp;c. <HI>And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a Book that is sealed, which men deliver unto one that is learned, saying, read this I pray thee, and he saith, I cannot for it is sealed: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, read this I pray thee, and he saith, I am not learned.</HI> And the Rea∣son why neither the learned nor unlearned in the Church can read the Book, is shewed in the 13th and 14th Verses. <HI>Where∣fore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this People draw near me with their Mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have remo∣ved their Heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men, Therefore I will add to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their Wisemen shall perish, and the understand∣ing of the prudent shall be hid.</HI> But the prophesie of this Book is not sealed up from God's Church, as is to be seen by the Book it self, <HI>chap</HI> 22.10. <HI>And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophesie of this Book.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. John to the seven Churches which are in Asia.</P>
<P>This is the Superscription of his Book by intimating to whom he directs it to;</P>
<P>Grace be unto you, and peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come.</P>
<P>Thus he Salutes them in that grace and mercy which they were made partakers of from God the Father under these terms, to wit, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Why doth John declare God the Father in these terms?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because he declared himself so to John before, as ap∣pears in <HI>v.</HI> 8. of this Chap. <HI>I am Alpha and O mega, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>2dly. <HI>Quest.</HI> Why doth John say</P>
<P>And from the seven spirits which are before his throne</P>
<P>Seeing the spirit of God is but one?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002172_0003_0FBC79F142C14AB0"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> He expresseth it as in the vision he saw it before the throne of God, as it appears in the 4th Chap. of this book, 5th Verse. <HI>And there was seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;</HI> thus John followeth the Vision and writeth things as they were revealed to him, calling the holy Spirit of God as he saw it, by the number SEVEN, tho' it be but one eternal Spirit in it self; yet as it is distributed by measure to seven Churches, it bears the name Seven. But I purpose to speak more fully to this in the fol∣lowing part of the Chapter, when I come to speak of the se∣ven Stars, and the seven golden Candle-sticks.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. And from Jesus Christ who is the faith∣ful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that grace and mercy was extended from these Three to the seven Churches, <HI>to wit,</HI> from God the Fa∣ther, and from the Spirit, and from Jesus Christ the son of the Father, who is the faithful witness of these things contained in this book of the revelation; and the first begotten of the dead to life again, by the resurrection of his body which was crucified on the cross: And tho' these are three discoveries of God, yet they are in union but one God. And this Jesus Christ is the Prince of the Kings of the earth, who hath lo∣ved us and washed us from our sins in his own Blood, this is to be understood through the sanctification of the Spirit which purifies the heart and inward parts of a sinner, according to <HI>David</HI>'s words, <HI>Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.</HI> Psal. 51.7.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. And hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his Father, to him be glory and do∣minion for ever and ever, Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7. Behold he cometh with clouds, and e∣very eye shall see him, and they also which pier∣ced him, and all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him, even so, Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Verse,</HI> 8. I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almightie.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002172_0004_0FBC79F34171CFE0"/>
Yea he is both God and man, as appears Rom. 9.5. <HI>And of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all God blessed forever. Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 9. I John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is an evidence that God's faithful children (while in this world) are companions with John in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ; and John's patience is a president for us who are in the kingdom of Jesus Christ and in this troublesome world, to be patient in tribulation, that thereby we may gain experience.</P>
<P>I was <HI>(saith he)</HI> in the Isle that is called Patmos.</P>
<P>Here he gives us an account where he was when he had this vision revealed to him, it was upon an Island, no doubt but where he was retire for the word of God, and for the tes∣timony of Jesus Christ. Here it appears that this book of the Revelation is a record of the word of God, and of the tes∣timony of Jesus Christ to his servant John.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 10. I was in the spirit on the Lords day.</P>
<P>This was the Lords day of the Revelation of the things contained in this Book, and John was the person that was to tarry till Christ did come and make them known to him, as appears by what the Lord Jesus hinted to Peter long before the time was come, even when he gave Peter that solemn charge to feed his lambs &amp; sheep, bidding Peter follow him; upon which charge given to Peter, and Peter seeing John following, he queries of Jesus concerning John, what was for him to do, as is to be seen, Joh. 21.20. &amp;c. <HI>Then Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee, follow thou me: Then went this saying abroad among the bre∣thren, that this disciple should not die; yet Jesus said not unto him, no shall not die, but if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee.</HI> From hence we may observe that the Lord Jesus hinted to Peter that he had a work also for his servant John to do, tho' then not understood by the brethren who thought he should not die, but now the Lords day of the Re∣velation of what is contained in this book is come, for John
<PB N="5" REF="002172_0004_0FBC79F34171CFE0"/>hath now tarried till the Lord is come, as appears, in the 18th and 19th verses, <HI>I am he that liveth and was dead, &amp;c. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>Some have groundlesly and scripturelesly imagined this re∣velation to be on a first day of the Week, but seeing no such thing is revealed in the book, neither is it a material thing to the opening of the history it self, it is altogether fruitless; for reason it self will tell us, that it contained some considera∣ble time more than one day, for John wrote those visions as he saw and heard them, as throughout the book it self appears; as for instance, Chap. 10.4. <HI>And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me, seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</HI> Thus the Lords day of revelations and visions which John saw, continued till he had accomplished the writing of them.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 11. Saying I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, and, What thou seest write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is the voice of the Authority of the Majesty of God, requiring and commanding John to write in a Book this visi∣on which should be set before his eyes, and to send it to the aforesaid Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 12. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me.</P>
<P>This great voice speaking behind the Apostle caused him to turn about,</P>
<P>And being turned, I saw seven golden candle∣sticks;</P>
<P>These seven golden candlesticks, represented to him the seven churches of Asia, to whom he was to write to. Now the reason why they are represented to him by candlesticks, is, because candlesticks hold up the light, to give light to all that are in the house, and God's Church are the light of the world, Mat. 5.14, 15. <HI>Ye are the light of the world; a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid, neither do men light a candle
<PB N="6" REF="002172_0005_0FBC79F4C40DF6C0"/>&amp; put it under a bushel; but on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.</HI> It is said of John the Baptist, <HI>that he was a burning and a shining light,</HI> Joh. 5.35. And the golden candlestick in the temple, with the seven lamps, did represent the mystical or spiritual church of Christ in u∣nion with the spirit of God, under the ministration of the law for the whole nation of Israel was adopted of God as a figure, under the old testament or ministration of the law written on stone: Yet they <HI>were not all Israel that were of Israel,</HI> for he only was esteemed to be of the Church of Christ, who was <HI>A Jew inwardly,</HI> and that only to be the <HI>circumcision which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inwardly in the heart, by the spirit of God, and not outwardly in the flesh.</HI> And therefore the golden candlestick in the temple with the seven lamps, did represent the spiritual Israel under that ministration, which was only in union with the spirit of God, and was then the light of the world; for the seven lamps then burning in the temple, did represent the <HI>seven spirits of God,</HI> for tho' it was but one candlestick yet it had a shaft and six branches which made seven, equal with the number of the lamps; so that that candlestick only held the light of the world, through the oyl of God's spirit, which caused the lamps over, or upon the candlestick, to give light to the world; and this figure in the temple did represent the whole spiritual church of Christ in that nation under the old testa∣ment; who was the light of the world. And this number seven in this book is mystical, and comprehends the whole of every thing it measures: As for instance, the seven golden can∣dlesticks which is the seven churches, comprehends all the churches of Christ in the world; and the seven stars compre∣hends not only the seven angels or ministers of the seven churches of Asia, but all the ministers of Christ's churches throughout the whole world. And the seven spirits of God, tho' it is but one spirit in its self, and is unmeasurable, yet it being given by measure to the seven churches, it bears the name seven, to comprehend the full distribution of it bestowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on all churches</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 13. And in the midst of the seven candle∣sticks, one like unto the Son of man, cloathed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002172_0005_0FBC79F4C40DF6C0"/>
This Vision which John saw like the Son of man in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, is a representation of the divine presence of God with his Churches, in union with his beloved Son Jesus Christ, <HI>whose delight is to be with the sons of men,</HI> Prov. 8.31. 2 Cor. 6.16. <HI>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</HI> And whereas he saw him clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden gir∣dle of strength and truth, as is written of him. Psal. 93.1. <HI>The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty, the Lord is clo∣thed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 14. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow.</P>
<P>Thus John saw him in the vision, as he is the Ancient of days, the father and creator of all things, the whiteness of his hair was to set forth his fatherly age, according to the vision of Daniel, 7.9. <HI>The hair of his head was like the pure wooll,</HI> And in this place it is said to be as white as snow, which is to set forth his grave, fatherly Majesty in the Person of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And his eyes were as a flame of fire;</P>
<P>Quick to discern all Things, the sight of whose eyes pierceth through all things, Heb. 4.13. <HI>Neither is their any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and o∣pen unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 15. And his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</P>
<P>Thus did John in the vision behold the terrible Majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ, who treads all his enemies under his feet, as was shewed to John in Chap. 10.2. <HI>And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the earth.</HI> And his voice was most terrible even as the sound of many wa∣ters: Psal. 93.4. <HI>The Lord on high is mightier thon the noise of many waters, yea, than the waves of the Sea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 16. And he hath in his right hand seven stars.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002172_0006_0FBC79F6FA6E1588"/>
This number seven stars comprehends all his Ministers, and how they are all upheld &amp; supported by the right hand of his power.</P>
<P>And out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword.</P>
<P>This is to represent the word of his power, to shew how terrible that Sentence is that proceeds out of his mouth, even as a sharp two edged Sword, to execute judgment upon his enemies. Heb. 4.12. <HI>For the word of God is quick and pow∣erful, and sharper than any two edged sword.</HI></P>
<P>His countenance was as the sun shining in his strength.</P>
<P>Thus terrible was the Majesty of his countenance to behold, 1 Tim. 6.16. <HI>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in that light which no wan can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see; to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 17. And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his right hand upon me, say∣ing unto me, fear not, I am the first and the last.</P>
<P>Thus glorious and terrible was the Majesty of the Lord Jesus, too terrible for John to behold, who fell at his feet as dead; but the Lord Jesus laid his right hand upon him, speaking comfortably to him, <HI>saying fear not, I am the first and the last,</HI> saith he: He is the first in his divine Nature, for he is the everlasting Father before all things; but in his humane nature he is the seed and offspring of David, and cal∣led the last Adam, 1 Cor. 15.45. <HI>The last Adam was made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quickning Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 18. I a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he that liveth and was dead.</P>
<P>This is to be understood in our nature; as he was Man he laid down his Life, for he had power to lay it down and to take it up again, as he was the last Adam a quickning Spirit: for he is the Resurrection and the Life; and saith he to John.</P>
<P>I was dead, and behold, I am alive for ever more. Amen.</P>
<P>This is a clear Testimony of the Resurrection of the same Body that was dead, but changed into a most glorious Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after the Resurrection.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002172_0006_0FBC79F6FA6E1588"/>
And he hath the Keys of Hell and of Death;</P>
<P>And in the last day will open the Graves of Death and Hell, that the dead may come forth unto his Judgement Seat.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 19. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.</P>
<P>The things which he had seen was the seven golden Can∣dlesticks, and the glorious Majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of them, with the seven Stars in his right hand: And the things which were was the present State of the seven Churches: And the things which were to be hereafter, doth not only contain the things of this world to the end thereof, but to the finishing of the world which is to come.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 20. The Mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven gol∣den candlesticks; the seven stars are the Angels of the seven Churches, and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven Churches.</P>
<P>This is the opening of the Mystery of the seven Stars, and of the seven golden Candlesticks.</P>

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>UNto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things, saith he that holdeth the seven Stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the Seven golden Candlesticks.</P>
<P>John directs this his first Epistle to the Angel or Minister of the Church of Ephesus, according to the requirement of the Lord, as appears in the first Sentence of this Verse, who
<PB N="10" REF="002172_0007_0FBC79FA08B66860"/>is one of the seven Stars in the right hand of the Lord Jesus who walketh in the midst of the seven Churches, who knows the State both of the Minister and Church, having the one in his right hand, and walking in the open view of the other.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil; and thou hast tryed them which say they are Apostles and are not, and hast found them Lyars.</P>
<P>The Lord signifies unto the Angel of this Church, how he takes notice of all his vertues, his works and his labour, and patience and how that he could not bear with them that were evil, and had tryed them which said they were Apostles and were not, and had found them lyars.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. And hast born, and hast patience, and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted.</P>
<P>Thus God takes notice as well of the good things done as he doth of the evil, commending them for the one, and threatning them for the other, if not repented of in time: To this end, that they may be encouraged to hold fast that which is good, and to be forewarned of the danger of that which is evil, these good things found in the elders of this Church, are those very things which Paul left in Charge with them the last time that ever they saw his face, as may be seen Acts 20.17. to the end of the Chapter. He there charged them <HI>to take heed to themselves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost had made them overseers.</HI> He fore∣warns them of wolves entering in among them, which caused them to trie them which said they were Apostles but were not, he sets before them his diligent labour on a spiritual and temporal Account, how his hands had ministred not only for his own necessities but for the relief of others also, shew∣ing them that so they ought to labour, and that it was the doctrine of Christ, that settled Elders should rather be given than receivers, tho Apostles had Power to forbear work, be∣cause of their differing State from settled Elders, being a tra∣velling
<PB N="11" REF="002172_0007_0FBC79FA08B66860"/>Ministry, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.8, 9. The Apostle thus fore∣warning them to labour with their hands as he had done for an example unto them. They were at this time found praise worthy in this matter also, <HI>I know thy works and thy labour, &amp;c. and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding the Lord saw all these good things before mentioned in this Church, yet he had somewhat against them for that they had left their first love; for this decay in love was a very dangerous thing in this Church; for love is the golden oyl which causeth the lamps to burn and give light.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. Remember therefore from whencethon art fallen and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will re∣move thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</P>
<P>The Lord puts this church in remembrance how they had fallen from their first love, and exhorts them to repent of their fall, and to do their first works, threatning them with speedy judgment if they did not repent of this their de∣cay in love. Shewing them what would be the woful effects of this their fall, if their were not timely repentance. The use of the candlestick is to hold the light, but if the light go out, the candlestick is of no use, but to be re∣moved o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of its place, and God's church is the light of the World, and that divine love that dwells in them is the gol∣den oyle that causeth the light to burn, or shine in his temple or house which is his church, Zech. 4.12. and a decay in love causeth the light to burn dim, and a total fall from love is a star fallen from heaven to the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and a lamp that gave a glorious light is now gone out, and this love that once gave them a clear light to see that they were translated from death unto life; they falling totally from it, their lamp is gone out, and they are left in total darkness; and their candlestick is removed out of its place, which once held a glorious light, and they know not whether they go because darkness hath blinded their eyes: this is the state of all that retain not the

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicholaitans, which I also hate.</P>
<P>This Church is commended in that they had a principle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hatred against the deeds of these Nicholaitans, what their deeds were was well known to this church, they being i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their day and time; and they were such deeds as God di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hate also: it is probable the name Nicholaitans did arise from the broacher of that corrupt doctrine whatsoever it was in the 14th verse of this chapter, it is compared to the doc∣trine of Baalam, who taught Balack to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to sacrifice unto Idols, and to commit fornication, this was such like corrupt doctrine to stumble the church of God.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches,</P>
<P>This is the first voice of the Spirit of God to the first church calling to every ear to hear what the spirit saith to the churches according to Christ's words, Mar. 13.37. <HI>What I say unto you say unto all, watch.</HI></P>

<P>I know thy works saith Christ, this is a comfortable word when it is spoken in way of commendation as it is to this Church, who laboured under great tribulation for Christ's sake, who did answer to Christ's sufferings, who suffered for their sakes, <HI>Yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</HI> 2 Tim. 3.12. We may see here that the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, for saith he, <HI>I know thy works and tribulation and poverty,</HI> they were brought into this poverty by affliction for Christs sake; who though he was rich, yet for their sakes became poor, and was obedient to the death of the cross: yet this their poverty in tribulation was their gain, for their poverty was such as is spoken of Mat. 5.3. <HI>Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the king∣dom of heaven;</HI> and therefore saith Christ to them <HI>but tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> art rich,</HI> for they indeed were heirs of the kingdom of heaven and it is he that giveth us richly all things to enjoy, and so had he enriched this church in faith, love, and righteousness; and as Christ saith unto them, <HI>I know thy works and tribulation,</HI> so likewise saith he to them, <HI>I know the blasphemy of then which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan,</HI> thus he intimates to them, as he hath the know∣ledge

<P>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer, saith Christ: This is a word of encouragement not only to this Church, but to every one that hath an ear to hear, as in the end of this Epistle will evidence: For these seven Churches comprehend all Churches, and every Christians state and con∣dition whatsoever. <HI>Behold</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tryed:</HI> God is wont thus to try his children by their accuser; thus was Job tryed in the furnace of affliction; thus God purifies his church, as in the seventh Chapter of this Book 14th Verse, <HI>These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.</HI> And saith Job, <HI>When he hath tryed me, I shall come forth as gold:</HI> And Job did not miss of his expectation, as is written of him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am. 5.11. <HI>We count them happy which endure: Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</HI></P>

<P>That is, the children begotten by this Adulteress, com∣pared to Jezabel; that is to say, the subverted part of this Church, which is gone a whoring from God: And thus he speaks after the similitude of the seduc'd Israelites of old who were begotten by the whoredom of Jezabel and were kill'd by Jehu in the house of Baal, which we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> children begotten in Adultery, and were such as the Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Isaiah speaks of, Isa. 57.3. <HI>But draw near hither ye sons of the Sorceress and the seed of the Adulterer and whore:</HI> and as Jehu saith, 2 Kin. 9.22. <HI>When Joram saw Jehu, he said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it peace, and Jehu answered, What peace, so long as the whore∣doms of thy mother Jezabel, and her Witchcrafts are so many</HI> This Jehu was the minister of God to execute judgment up∣on those children begotten in Adultery; who were seduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Jezebel's prophets, whom Elijah slew. And here the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God threatens the whoredom that was committed in this Church with the like Judgment, except they repent in time forewarning them of their danger, by setting before them what came upon their predecessors in the like case: and saith he <HI>whose eyes are as a flame of Fire</HI></P>
<P>And all the Churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</P>

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 24. But unto you I say.</P>
<P>This is spoken to the Six Churches, and unto the rest in Thyatira, that is, to that part of this Church also, which is not corrupted with this Doctrine, as in the following words appears; to wit,</P>
<P>As many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depth of Satan, as they speak:</P>
<P>That is, as these Seducers speak, but the Son of God hath such piercing eyes, that he sees the whole depth of Satan in his wily working to deceive the Churches by this doct∣rine, which no doubt was carried on under fair pretences to beguile the Churches, as he had beguiled Eve, and there∣fore said the Son of God to the six Churches, and to so many of this Church which had not drank in this Doct∣rine,</P>
<P>I will put upon you none other burden.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 25. But that which ye have already, hold fast till I come.</P>
<P>This coming is his coming in Judgment, against these Seducers and their bastard children begotten in Adultery, which he will kill with death, as he killed those false Prophets by Jehu; and Ahabs seventy sons, and all the house of Ahab, with all Jezabel's bastard children in the Spiritual Whoredom in the Church of God, under the first Covenant, so that this is a general Exhortation to all the faithful Children of God, to hold fast their integrity till he come, and execute his Judgment upon such as profess his name in words, and outward pre∣tences of holiness; and so deceive the Churches of God: But the Son of God whose eyes are as a flame of fire, sees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>into their reius and hearts, and will give unto every one ac∣cording to their works.</P>

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>ANd unto the Angel of the Church in Sardis write these things, saith he that hath the se∣ven Spirits of God, and the seven Stars, I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead.</P>
<P>This is the fifth Epistle which John is ordered to write unto the Church of Sardis, by order from him who hath the seven Spirits of God and the seven Stars, and therefore most absolutely hath a perfect knowledge of the State of the Angel of this Church, seeing he hath the seven Stars in his right hand; so that this Minister, or Angel, must of necessity be upheld by him, or of necessity must fall, and what a man hath in his right hand he hath a perfect view of it; and the state of this Church must needs be known by him whether it be living or dead; for he hath the seven Spirits of God, that is, <HI>he hath the fulness of the spirit without measure;</HI> and it is he that giveth it, &amp; he that taketh it away: It is a talent given by him to his own servants to improve, as appears, 1 Cor. 12.7. <HI>The manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal:</HI> But if they to whom it is given make no profitable improvement, he is wont to take it from them; Mat. 25.28. <HI>Take therefore the talent from him;</HI> that is, from him that made no improvement of it. That which made this Church a living Church, was a measure of these seven spirits of God bestowed upon them to profit withal; and he that hath the seven Spirits of God, knows to whom he bestows it upon, and from whom he takes it a way; and he testifieth, that this Church hath a name to live and is
<PB N="26" REF="002172_0015_0FBC7A0B42C52310"/>dead, and his testimony is true; it is the Spirit that quick∣eneth or maketh a living Church or Member: And if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spirit of God be taken away, the Church or Member from whom it is taken away is dead: And this was the state o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Church, <HI>thou hast a name that thou livest and are dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain that are ready to die.</P>
<P>And in the 4th verse it appears, that there was but a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> names in this Church, but what had defiled their garments so that the greatest number had a name to live but was dead; they had sinned that sin unto death. which the Apostle John speaks of, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.16. He that hath the seven Spirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God, exhorts that remnant to watch, and to strengthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the things which were remaining that were ready to die: for saith he,</P>
<P>For I have not found thy works perfect be∣fore God.</P>
<P>This testimony of this imperfection, is a sad character o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such as make an outside show and great pretences of holiness and thereby get a name in this world of being a living Church, when indeed they are dead; for this was the state of this Church.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. Remember therefore how thou ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> received and heard.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord puts them in mind, how they had hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the glad tidings of their Salvation, and received the spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Adoption from him who hath the seven Spirits of God and exhorts them to <HI>hold fast</HI> their own Salvation, and not to let it go; for saith Christ in another place, <HI>What would it advantage a man if he should gain the whole world, and lost his own soul; or what shall a man give in exchange for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soul:</HI> And therefore exhorts them to repent of their imper∣fections; for in the foregoing verse saith he, <HI>For I have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found thy works perfect before God.</HI> Thus he accuses the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with hypocrisy, and that they had thereby got a name to live, when indeed they were dead, and therefore exhorts them to <HI>repent</HI> in time, and to be upon their watch; for saith he,</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002172_0015_0FBC7A0B42C52310"/>
If therefore thou shalt not watch; I will come on thee as a chief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</P>
<P>This is a threatning of sudden and unlook'd for Judgment that should be executed upon them when they least think of it. Luke 21.35. <HI>For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth; watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the son of man.</HI> Thus the Lord forewarneth them what would be the event of their woful state, except they repent of their works and watch; for these that have a name to live and are dead, are the evil servant <HI>which shall say in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite his fellow servants;</HI> yea, they are those foolish virgins that have not kept oyl in their vessels, and their Lord coming suddenly findeth them sleeping; and therefore saith Christ to this Church and to all others in their state, <HI>Watch ye therefore; for ye know neither the day nor hour wherein the son of man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ometh.</HI> And he that doth not repent and watch, the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not ware of; and shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut him off, and appoint him his portion with hypocrites; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. Thou hast a few Names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments.</P>
<P>This verse sheweth that there was but a few Names in this Church but what had defiled their garments; and this few he promiseth them, that</P>
<P>They shall walk with him in white, for they are worthy.</P>
<P>What is intended by these white garments is opened in the 19th Chapter, 7th and 8th verses. <HI>For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her self ready.</HI> By the Lamb is intended he that hath the seven Spirits of God, <HI>chap.</HI> 5, 6. and by his wife is intended his Church; and having made her self ready, is, she hath put on her wedding
<PB N="28" REF="002172_0016_0FBC7A0CC1D15118"/>garment which is granted to her, that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white; and by this fine linen is intend∣ed the righteousness of the Saints, which is granted them thro' the Faith of the Son of God. <HI>And there was but a few names in Sardis</HI> but what had defiled their garments, and these few saith Christ, <HI>shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy:</HI> But the other and the greater part of this Church had been arrayed in the like rayment, clean and white before they had defiled them; but not having kept their garments clean, they are not counted worthy, but shall be esteemed as he that had not on his wedding garment. <HI>When the king came in to see his sons marriage, and beheld one of the guests which had not on his wedding garment, he said unto his servants, bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</HI> Mat. 22.11, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. He that overcometh <HI>(saith the Lord)</HI> the same shall be cloathed in white raiment.</P>
<P>This victory by overcoming is by Faith in him that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven Stars in his right hand, who always gives the victory to the men of Faith 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.</HI> This crown of righteousness is the white garment which those that overcome are arrayed in; and none but them that overcome can keep their garments clean, Chap. 7.14. <HI>These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> white in the blood of the lamb. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.12. These light afflictions which are but for a moment, is as the furnace to separate the dross from the metal; and those that thus overcome in tribulation, the same shall be thus cloathed in this white raiment of righteousness.</P>
<P>And I will not blot out his name out of the book of life.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="002172_0016_0FBC7A0CC1D15118"/>
This is spoken as a Captain, that hath a list of the names of his soldiers: So, Christ here speaketh as if he had a list of the names of his soldiers enrolled in heaven; and those that prove cowards in his warfare, he blots out their names out of his book of life; and those that overcome he will not blot out their names, <HI>but he will confess them before his Father and before his holy Angels:</HI> And those whose names are blotted out of the Book of Life, are those which have a name to live and are dead; for if they have no name in the Book of Life, they must of necessity be dead; and those that see their names in the Book of Life are living warriours, listed in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foun∣dation of the world.</P>

<HEAD>The seventh CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 14. And unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans, write these things saith the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the begin∣ning of the Creation of God.</P>
<P>This is the 7th and last Epistle, to the seventh and last Church which John is order'd to write unto. <HI>Saith the Amen.</HI> This is a conclusive word (from him who orders John to write) and carries in it, <HI>So be it.</HI> The Son of God is the faithful and true Witness, <HI>chap.</HI> 1.5. <HI>The beginning of the creation of God; Joh.</HI> 1.1. compared with the 14th verse. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.15. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 15. I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot.</P>
<P>This is the testimony that is testifyed to this Church, by him who is the faithful and true Witness, who knows their works, and giveth them a faithful and true testimony what state they are in; that is, neither cold nor hot, which is very unsavoury, and like to be spued out of his mouth.</P>
<P>I would (<HI>saith he</HI>) thou wast either cold or hot.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 16. So then, because thou art luke∣warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 17. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002172_0019_0FBC7A1446AF0B58"/>
In this verse he gives them the reason why he will spue them out of his mouth; for they are in such an unsavoury state, that they are no ways teachable, because they think they are that which indeed they are not; they are such as Christ in his doctrine saith, <HI>Wo unto you that are rich;</HI> that is, so in their conceit, but in reality it is not so. But saith the faithful and true Witness,</P>
<P>But thou knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and na∣ked.</P>
<P>Thus was this Church deceived in themselves, and was got into a most wretched and miserable condition; for they were poor, but thought themselves to be rich; they were blind, but conceited they saw; naked, but thought they were cloathed; they had no faith to enrich them, and knew it not; they gloried in their own wisdom, but were unacquainted with the state of wisdom's children; they were not cloathed with the righteousness of the saints, but knew it not; they conceited they saw, but had not the eye of Faith, but was spiritually blind.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ryed in the fire that thou mayest be rich.</P>
<P>This gold is that precious Faith that the Apostle Peter speaks of, 1 Pet. 1.7. <HI>That the tryal of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, tho' it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tried with fire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I counsel thee to buy of me gold that thou mayest be rich.</HI> They are indeed happy that take this counsel, that they may be rich in that faith which works by love.</P>
<P>And buy of me white rayment that thou mayest be cloathed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.</P>
<P>This white rayment is the righteousness of the saints, <HI>chap.</HI> 19.18.</P>
<P>And anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="002172_0019_0FBC7A1446AF0B58"/>
This eye salve is the Spirit of God, that enlightens the eyes of the understanding. I counsel thee, saith the Lord Jesus, to buy of me these things; yea, he alone is the hea∣venly Merchant who is able to supply this Church, and all others with this heavenly treasure; for he hath all his heavenly fathers treasure in his own hand, and if we will be supplied with these things, we must sell all that we have of our own, to purchase these things to fit us for his kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore and repent.</P>
<P>The Lord acquaints this Church, that his rebukes and chastising of them was in love and mercy, and not in judg∣ment; and therefore he exhorts them to repent.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 20. Behold I stand at the door and knock.</P>
<P>This is at the door of the heart, by the voice of his chastisements, that the King of Glory may come in: And it is spoken by the similitude of a man knocking at the door of his house desiring it may be opened unto him, that he may enter in. And the saints Bodies is the House or Temple of God, and Christ stands knocking and calling many times at his Temple or House door, saying, <HI>Behold I stand at the door and knock:</HI></P>
<P>If any man hear my voice and open to me, I will come in and will sup with him, and he with me.</P>
<P>He that opens the door for him to come in, will have a joyful house, and a merry supper, for he is a blessed companion, and will make a merry heart when he comes into his Temple. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="002172_0020_0FBC7A15D66FCA28"/>
This is a wonderful and gracious promise made unto this Church by the Son of God, to encourage them and all others to fight the good sight of Faith, that we may be counted worthy to sit down with him in his throne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he hath overcome and is set down with his father in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> throne, in the kingdom and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given unto the people of the saints of the most high, whose kingdom is an ever∣lasting kingdom, and all dominions shall obey him.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The first Vision of the seven Churches being ended, a second Vision of future things is made known to John as followeth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>AFter this I looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, come up hither, and will shew thee things which must be here∣after.</P>
<P>This verse sheweth us, that after John's first Vision was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded, he looked and behold a door was opened in heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the first voice which he heard was as it were of a trum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et talking with him, inviting him to go up into heaven, promising him to shew unto him things that was afterward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o come to pass.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And immediately I was in the Spi∣rit (<HI>saith he.</HI>)</P>
<P>That is, in such a spiritual frame, being prepared of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o behold, and to make a report of what was to be made known to him. And saith he,</P>
<P>Behold a throne was set in heaven.</P>
<P>This was the throne of God Almighty, <HI>Isai.</HI> 66.1. <HI>Acts</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.49.</P>
<P>And one sat on the throne.</P>
<P>He that sits on this throne is God Almighty, even Jesus Christ the Creator of all things, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.5. 1 Tim. 6.15. <HI>Which in his times, he shall shew who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.</HI></P>

For saith John, <HI>I saw under the Altar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> souls of them that were slain.</HI> The Soul is many times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken for the Body, as in the 16th chapter of this Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ird verse, <HI>And every living soul died in the sea;</HI> as also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts 2.31. <HI>He seeing this besore, speake of the resurrection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, that is, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave, as Davids was, who saw corruption.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 10.

<P>This sheweth that the blood of Gods saints cries for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngeance; and tho' God's patience is extended for a time wards sinners, yet they shall not escape his hand.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 11. And white robes were given to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery one of them.</P>
<P>All Gods persecuted &amp; suffering Saints are here represented John in this vision, as slain and lying under the Altar, and they came out of great tribulation, and thereby were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rifyed by the fire of affliction.</P>
<P>It is said, white robes were given to every one of them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is written, Chap. 7.14. <HI>These are they that came out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite in the blood of the Lamb.</HI> And it was said unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, that they should <HI>rest yet for a little season.</HI> This is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer to their cries who cried and said, how long, O Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em that dwell on the earth.

<P>The white robes was to represent their righteous state, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> palms in their hands to shew their Victory.</P>

<P>Thus they ascribe their Salvation and Victory to him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sits on the throne and to the Lamb.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 11, 12. And all the Angels stood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four beasts, and fell before the throne on the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> faces and worshipped God, saying, Amen, blessing and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for ever and ever, amen.</P>
<P>And thus all the Angels that stood round about the thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped God, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cribing blessing, and glory, and Wisdom, and thanksgiving and honour, and power, and might to God for ever and ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Amen.</P>

<P>Thus the Church of Christ is represented to John in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> state of puritie and holiness, after their great tribulation, which was shewed in the opening of the fifth Seal, how they
<PB N="57" REF="002172_0030_0FBC7A28796BA948"/>saying, how long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd a venge our Blood on them that dwell on the earth: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow the day of their deliverance is come, and the destruction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their Enemies, by a dreadful overthrow from the throne of God.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 15. Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve him day &amp; night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.</P>
<P>These are they that serve him in his temple, that is in their inward man in Spirit and in truth. for their <HI>bodies is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emple of God, and he dwelleth in them.</HI> 2 Cor. 6.16.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 16, 17. They shall hunger no more, neithes thirst any more, neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat,</P>
<P>For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way all tears from their eyes.</P>
<P>Thus Gods Church is comforted with their everlasting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy and happiness to all Eternity.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that at the opening of the sixth Seal, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utter destruction of the enemies of God's Church cometh up∣on them, and is the period of their glory and happiness, who before sat as a queen, saying in her heart, I am a queen and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am no Widow, and shall see no sorrow, chap. 18.7. <HI>Thou say∣est, I shall be a lady for ever, I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children,</HI> Isai. 47.8. <HI>Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning, and famine, and she shall be utterly burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her,</HI> chap. 18.8. <HI>But these two things shall come to thee, in a moment, in one day the loss of children and widow∣hood, they shall come upon thee in their perfection,</HI> Isai. 47.9.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>ANd when he had opened the seventh Seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</P>
<P>In the opening of all the six Seals, there was a discovery made to John of extraordinary things that immediately ap∣peared, but upon the opening of this seal, only silence in the court of heaven, because in the opening of the six seals, the judgments of God were executed upon the wicked, and be∣fore the opening of the seventh Seal, the church hath her deliverance, and is in a flourishing state, so that at the open∣ing of the seventh Seal, there is only silence, it being a period of time, and matters ended in the court of heaven.</P>
<P>In the foregoing chapter, we have an account of those that were sealed out of every tribe there mentioned, &amp; after that a great multitude which no man could number, out of all na∣tions, and kindreds, and tongues, and people stood before the thone, and before the Lamb.</P>
<P>This vision sheweth the state of the church in the primitive
<PB N="60" REF="002172_0032_0FBC7A2D5CC474C8"/>time, even its flourishing state; and the first verse of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chap. is the conclusion of that history of opening the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and another history begins, more particularly about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the church of Christ, beginning at its flourishing state, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so continuing till it is apostatized and wholly degenera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from God. The Lamb of God having thus loosed the se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seals, we have now an open book to read and what is con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ned therein, will be proclaimed by the found or the trum∣pet.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And I saw the seven Angels whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stood before God, and to them were given seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trumpets.</P>
<P>John doth not say he saw seven Angels standing befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, as if this was the first right of them, but that he sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the seven Angels which stood before God, as speaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Angels spoken of before, in this book of the revelation and that now in this present vision, he saw seven trumpet given to the seven angels which he had before seen standing before God: So that these seven angels appear to be the seven Angels or seven stars in the right hand of him that always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doth comprehend all his faithful ministers of this flourish ing church, and the seven trumpets given to them, do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shew that they are they that founds God's judgements, and other things, before the, come to pass, or proclaim the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before the execution of them, and is no other thing, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what the prophets were wont to do under the old testament, as for instance, Amos. 3.6, 7. <HI>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid, surely the Lord God will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> phets.</HI> Ezek. 32.2. and third verses compared with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> venth verse. <HI>If the people of the land, take a man of their coast and set him for their watchman, if when he seeth the sword or ming upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o thou son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel, therefore thou shalt bear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. Hos.</HI> 8.1. <HI>Set the trumpet to thy mouth, he shall come as an eagle against the house of the Lord, because they have transgressed my Covenant.</HI> And the seven priests
<PB N="61" REF="002172_0032_0FBC7A2D5CC474C8"/>that went before the ark of God, with seven trumpets, which did sound the downfall of Jericho, which is an evident figure of what is here spoken of, of these seven Angels with their seven trumpets. In going over this book we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what they did proclaim by the found of the trumpet, by what fol∣lowed the found of them.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne.</P>
<P>This was the service of the High Priest only, under the law, to offer incense upon the golden Altar which was be∣fore the mercy Seat. And doth shew that this Angel was the Lord Jesus Christ himself, who maketh intercession for us, in that it is said, and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the Prayers of all Saints. This was figured out under the Law, as is spoken of Zechariah the High Priest, Luk. 1.10. <HI>And the whole mul∣titude of the people were praying without at the time of in∣tense.</HI> And here it is spoken of Christ our great High Priest.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God, out of the angels hands.</P>
<P>This shews, that Jesus Christ our Intercessor or Advocate, causes the cryes and prayers of God's Servants to come up before him as sweet Incense.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. And the Angel took the Censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth:</P>
<P>This verse sheweth that as the prayers and cries of the Saints, mentioned in the foregoing verse came up before God, through the intercession of Jesus Christ, which intercession is signified by his offering the incense with their prayers. And his filling the Censer with fire of the altar, and casting it into the earth, is to shew his executing Gods fiery judg∣ments
<PB N="62" REF="002172_0033_0FBC7A2EAF6112F8"/>upon the Inhabitants of the earth, for the Injury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his church, whose cries and prayers was heard, and ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ment executed upon their oppressors.</P>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there were voices, and thunderings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lightenings, and an earthquake:</P>
<P>The casting of the fire of the altar into the earth, doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present God's angry judgments executed upon the wick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the voices doth shew their outcries, that they were frigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ed thereby; and his judgments are compared to thund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and lightnings, and the earthquake, is to setforth their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bling at the said Judgments, Isai. 29.6. <HI>Thou shalt be vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake.</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time when these judgments were executed, sounded by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two first trumpets, was in the time of the persecuting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thenish Empires of Rome: for the trumpets sounded w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was written in the seal'd book: and therefore the seals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be opened before the seven Angels could sound what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> written therein.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. And the seven angels which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</P>
<P>Thus God is wont to forewarn before he executes his ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ments, as he did to Nineveh, and to Pharaoh, to Samaria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jerusalem.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7.

<P>This first trumpet sounds those judgments discovered the opening of the first four Seals, and they are here represent∣ed by hail and fire mingled with blood, and cast upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> earth, aluding from the fire taken from the altar, spoken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the 5th verse, <HI>And the Angel took the censer, and filled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with fire of the Altar, and cast it into the earth:</HI> This fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Altar being cast into the earth, doth represent God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gry judgments inflicted upon the enemies of his Church as may be seen in the opening of the 5th Seal, chap. 6.9, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I saw under the altar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="63" REF="002172_0033_0FBC7A2EAF6112F8"/>testimony which they held, and they cried with a loud voice, say∣ing how long O Lord holy and true, dost thou not judge and a∣venge our blood on them that dwell on the earth.</HI> Compare this with the third, fourth, and fifth verses, of this Chapter, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t appears that Jesus Christ their Advocate and Intercessor, appeared to make intercession for them, by offering much in∣cense with the prayers of all Saints; and then filled the cen∣ser with fire of the Altar, and cast it into the earth, which represented the execution of those Judgments, opened in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first Seals, and in the sixth Seal, and proclaimed by the two first trumpets, and executed in the time of the reign of the Heathenish persecuting Emperours of Rome, till their ut∣ter destruction came upon them, as by the next trumpet will appear.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 8. And the second Angel sounded, &amp; as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it were a great mountain burning with fire was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became blood.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 9. And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he third part of the Ships were destroyed.</P>
<P>The effects which followed both these trumpets, doth new very great judgments were executed on the earth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, by great effusion of blood, both upon the earth, and sea, which denotes the Inhabitants thereof.

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 14. Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four Angels whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are bound in the great river Euphrates.</P>
<P>Here are several things to be observed from this verse; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first is, the voice came from the four horns of the golden altar. And secondly, it was directed to the angel which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht sixth trumpet. And thirdly, the voice commanded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> required him to loose the four angels that was bound in the great River Euphrates.</P>
<P>First, We are to consider, the four horns of the Altar from whence the voice came, pointed every ways, both north, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> south, east, and west.</P>
<P>Secondly, We shall find that the voice that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> directed to the angel which had founded the sixth trumpet, did command him to loose the four Angels that was bound in the great river Euphrates. And,</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="002172_0040_0FBC7A3CB1DD1360"/>
Thirdly, That these four angels did represent to John, how tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every quarter they were bound in the great River Eu∣phrates. And</P>
<P>Fourthly, It is necessary to know what is intended by their being bound in the great River Euphrates. Euphrates was a river that did belong to old Babylon, as may be seen, Jer. 51.60. &amp;c. And their being bound in said River, doth shew that they were bound under the power and Dominion of Mystical Babylon, even under Apollyons doctrine and de¦lusions: but after that this angel had sounded the sixth trum∣pet, which was to give notice what was to follow, and that which followed was a command to him that had sounded that is the sixth Angel, to loose the four Angels, that they might be prepared at an hour, and a Day, and a month, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> year thus to be ready at all times to make war, against such as <HI>worship Devils, and Idols of Gold and Silver,</HI> &amp;c. as ap∣pears in the two last verses of this chap. but that which followed the found of the foregoing trumpet, that is the fifth trumpet, was the coming forth of the locusts, and became a kingdom, whose king was Apollion, but that which followed this sixth trumpet, is an army prepared to engage war against Apollyon's army, and to destroy a third part of them. Possibly here is mentioned a certain number for an uncertain; and this army were such as were bound in the great river Euphrates before the sixth Angel sounded; but upon his sounding, they are loosed in every quarter, and prepared to be in a readiness, at the pouring out of the sixth viol; for then the great river Euphrates will be dried up, as may be seen in Chap. 16.12. <HI>And the sixth Angel pow∣ered out his viol upon the great river Euphrates, and the waters thereof were dried up; that the way of the kings of the east night be prepared.</HI></P>
<P>This alludes from the destruction of old Babylon, by the Meads and Persians, who came out of the east, and by trench∣es dryed up the great river Euphrates, by which means her destruction came; for by that means they entred the city, and so took it. And her power and great dominion is ex∣press'd by the similitude of many waters, <HI>Jer.</HI> 51.13. <HI>O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thy end is come, and the measure of thy coverousness.</HI> Thus the
<PB N="78" REF="002172_0041_0FBC7A3F07483A30"/>greatness of her dominion, and power, is express'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> similitude of many waters; and her destruction is set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by drying them up, as in the 36th and 37th verses of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same Chapter, <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord, behold I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up her sea, and make her springs dry, and Babylon shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heaps.</HI> And Chap. 50.38. <HI>A drought is upon her waters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they shall be dryed up: for it is the land of graven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and they are mad upon their idols.</HI></P>
<P>But this Chapter I am treating upon, is not speaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the utter destruction of mystical Babylon, but loosing select army, which before was bound under her power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dominion; but now is prepared to be in a readiness for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make war against her, or Apollyons army or kingdom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the next verse.</P>

<P>Here we may observe, that this army is prepared to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a readiness at every occasion; and that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as were before bound in the great river Euphrates, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are now loosed from that bondage, by a voice that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the four horns of the golden altar, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God; and that the four horns of the golden altar was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> place where atonement was wont to be made by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blood of the sin offering, hath already been proved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scripture testimony; and that the river they were bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was the river Euphrates, which was a river that did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long to old Babylon, and that it alludes from that rives<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evident, and that waters in scripture doth hold forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> minion and great power is evident; as may be seen, Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 7, &amp;c. <HI>Now therefore behold the Lord bringeth upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the waters of the rivers strong and many, even the king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Assyria, and all his glory,</HI> &amp;c.

Jacinct is a precious stone, as may be seen, <HI>Chap.</HI> 21.20. And as it is described by writers it is of a waterish or smokey colour. The precious stone doth represent to us, that they had on the breast-plate of righteousness.</P>
<P><HI>And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions.</HI> This is to shew their courage and boldness.</P>
<P><HI>And out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brim∣stone,</HI> These are terrible destructive things; and she weth, that the destruction of their enemies was by that which came out of their mouths; and that their breast-plates, and that which came out of their mouths by which their enemies were killed was the same, excepting the jacinct (which is a precious stone) which is put in the place of the smoke, it being of a waterish smokey colour, and is to represent them to have the breast-plate of <HI>faith and right teousness;</HI> and the fire and brimstone is to shew, that God was a wall of fire round about them, as he was of old to them that had deliverance out of old Babylon, as these had deliverance out of mystical Babylon, Zech. 2.5, &amp;c. <HI>For I saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round a∣bout,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Deliver thy self, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</HI> So that this breast-plate of fire and brimstone did represent that God who is a consuming fire was their defence.</P>

<P>This destruction of the enemies of God, and of his Church, which was by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths, shews that they were like a <HI>hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaff, and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left,</HI> Zech. 12.6. <HI>For they are God's battel an and weapons of war; for with them will be break in pieces the nations, and with them will

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 19. For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails; for their tails were like unto serpents, &amp; had heads and with them they do hurt.</P>
<P>Here it is said their power is in their mouth, which shews as before was said, the destruction of their enemies was by the fire, smoke and brimstone, which issued out of their mouths; all which shews they were mystical things, and are not to be understood after a carnal manner; for her is two Armies mentioned in this Chapter; the Angel of the bottomless pit, whose name is a destroyer is king of the one; and the other army was those that were bound in the great river Euphrates, which doth allude from the river of old Babylon, but are now upon the sounding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sixth trumpet delivered from under her power and de∣minion, as Israel of old was from under the power and dominion of old Babylon, and prepared for the destruction of the wicked. And the execution they did, proceeded out of their mouths: So that they are two mystical armies, &amp; are prepared to fight a mystical battel, such a battel as such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣riers are wont to fight; for this army of Apollyons which ascended out of the bottomless pit, was prepared against the Saints, as may be seen Chap. 11.7. <HI>The beast that ascea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣eth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war against them, that is, against the two witnesses;</HI> and this army is prepared against Apollyons, to be in a readiness, at an hour, and at a day, &amp;c. And their testimony that issueth out of their mouth, is compared to fire, smoke and brimstone; for it is a mystical battel, such a battel as Christ's soldiers were wont to fight; as for instance, 1 Cor. 15.32. <HI>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not at all.</HI> These beasts were such Locusts as these which are here spoken of, and the war is such a mystical war, as the Apostle saith in another place, <HI>I have fought a good sight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.3, 4. <HI>Thou there∣fore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No
<PB N="83" REF="002172_0043_0FBC7A4206FE11D0"/>man that warmth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</HI> He that overcometh in such a battel as this is, is a good soldier of Jesus Christ; Mat. 10.34, 35. <HI>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth, I came not to send peace but a sword; for I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother.</HI> Thus temporal relations are divided in this battel; when the father is one of this select army, and the son one of the destroyers army, the father is against the son, and the son against the father, and the daughter against her mother, and the mother against her daughter.</P>
<P>This Apollion and his army in this warfare, warreth against the saints by persecution, there being out few such counsellors among them as Gamaliel was, Acts. 5.38, 39. <HI>And now I say unto you, refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought, but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it, lest hap∣ly ye be found even to fight against God.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas it is said of this select army, that their power is in their mouth; this is no new thing; but that which hath always appeared in this warfare; that is, that the enemies of God's Church hath ever been destroyed by that which came out of the mouths of the saints, who warred against their enemies and oppressors. As for instance, all those Judgments which came upon Egypt, were de∣nounc'd by the mouth of Moses, before they were executed on the Egyptians; for God was always wont (as appears by the testimony of the Scriptures) to denounce his Judg∣ments by the mouth of this select army, before the execu∣tion of them, as appears throughout the books of the old testament, Hosea 6.5. <HI>Therefore I have hewed them by the Prophets, I have stain them by the words of my mouth.</HI> Jer. 51.20, 21. <HI>Thou art my battel ax, and weapons of war, for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms, and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider, and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider.</HI> 2 King. 1.10. <HI>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I he a man of God, let five come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty;
<PB N="84" REF="002172_0044_0FBC7A43836E6718"/>and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his fifty.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the destruction of the enemies of God, came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the mouths of his Servants the Prophets, before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were executed; Chap. 11.5. <HI>And if any man will hurt then fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> It is by the word of their testimony that they overcome in this battel, not loving their lives unto the death, and by denouncing God's Judgments before they are executed, as appears, Jer. 5.14. <HI>Behold, I will make my words in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</HI> Thus they always warred against Apollyons army, and the Judgments followed as the tail which comes after, for it is said their tails had heads like Serpents, and with them they do hurt; that is, they hurt their enemies by giving them a mortal wound, like a serpent, which always follows the word of their testimony; for it is said, out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone, that by these there was the third part of men killed, so that it was a serpentine wound that they gave them, being mortal; and this killing or destruction came upon Apollyons army, as is to be seen in the two following verses.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 20. And the the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship Devils, and Idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood, which neither can see nor hear, nor walk.</P>
<P>Here we have an account in this verse, that altho' testi∣mony was born against Idolaters, by the mouth of God's servants, and the Judgments of God executed upon them for their Idolatry and Persecution which always accompa∣ny it; yet they repented not of their Idolatry; that is to say, those that remained and were not killed with those forementioned plagues; as is said, Isai. 26.11. <HI>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see, but they shall see and be ashamed for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards thy people.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="002172_0044_0FBC7A43836E6718"/>
<HI>Verse</HI> 21. Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</P>
<P>This verse sheweth us, as they repented not of their Idolatries; so likewise they repented not of their murders, that is, their persecution, or murdering the saints; for it is said of this false Church, Chap. 18.24. <HI>For in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</HI> This last sentence, to wit, all that were slain upon the earth, is to be understood, all that were slain by persecution, were murdered by this Church.</P>
<P><HI>Neither repented they of their sorceries;</HI> that is, of their false doctrine, by which they bewitched the people, as Paul saith, <HI>Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, Gal.</HI> 3.1. Chap. 18.23. <HI>For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived;</HI> that is to be understood by her false doctrine, she deceived all nations.</P>
<P><HI>Neither repented they of their fornication:</HI> That is to be understood of their spiritual whoredom; for this Church which this Chapter is treating upon, was not only the Synagogue of Satan, coming out of the bottom∣less pit, but the mother of harlots or fornications; as is to be seen, Chap. 17.5.</P>
<P><HI>Neither repented they of their thefts:</HI> For tho' the saints took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.34. yet that did not excuse these Apollyons of their thefts in ta∣king their goods from them, Joh. 7.7. In the first part of this Chapter we have an account what followed the sound of the fifth trumpet, to wit, the apostatizing of the true Church, and the rising out of the smoke of the bottomless pit the false Church, and becoming a great and a strong army under their King Apollyon. And in the latter part of this Chapter we have an account what followed the sound of the sixth trumpet, to wit, a voice came from the four horns of the golden altar, which was from the place of attonement, to the Angel which had the sixth trumpet say∣ing to him, loose the four Angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates; the loosing of these four Angels, doth

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again.</P>

<P>Go and take the little Book which was o∣pen in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the Sea, and upon the earth.</P>
<P>This little book is an open revelation to John, and con∣tains a history of the future state of the Church, which
<PB N="92" REF="002172_0048_0FBC7A4C0BF9DF48"/>John is to publish and make known, but not the thing uttered by the seven thunders, for them were the sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> judgments of God executed upon the enemies of his Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at such times as they are promising themselves peace and safety.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 9. And I went unto the Angel, and said unto him, give me the little book, and he said unto me take it, and eat it up, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall make thy belly bitter, but shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thy mouth sweet as honey.</P>
<P>The voice that came from heaven and said to John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take the book, was the voice of God the Father, it bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> handed to John by the Son of God, who had received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from God the Father, and opened the Seal of it, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vered it to John, and bid him eat it, and told him what should be the effect of eating of it, to wit, bitter in his belly, but sweet in his mouth as honey.</P>

<P>Thus John found it as the Angel had told him: it was very defirable to John to know what was contained in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little book; but when John had eaten it, that is, had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> revelation of it by Jesus Christ, and come to understand by it, the sad, miserable and afflicted state of the Church it was bitter in his belly; he having now a new revelant on of future things, made known to him by Jesus Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is in a capacity to prophecy again.</P>

<P>In the foregoing Chapter we have an account, how that a mighty Angel came down from Heaven, and he had in his hand a little book open; and how that John took the book out of the Angels hand, and eat it up; which was to signify, that John was inspired by the Spirit of God, to write a prophetical history of the Church, or of what was contained in the little book, from that time forward.</P>

This is intended the real temple or house of God, that Solomons temple was a Figure of, that John is here called to measure, and the Antitype of that Altar which Solomon built, and the true worshippers of God, he is here required to measure, who worshippeth him in his holy temple; and therefore it is needful to know, what is intended by this temple, and this altar, and who are the true worshippe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therein: for all this John is required to measure, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more.

And secondly, the after was to be measured with the temple, and having thus shewed what temple he was to measure, the next i the altar upon which they offered all their Sacrificed by which attonement was made, this was a type of Christ upon whom we offer all our Sacrifices by faith, this Altar was also to be measured with the temple, and thirdly these that worshipped therein, that is in the temple of God, thus he was to measure the temple of God, and the Altar, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them that worship therein, and no more, and all this alludes from those figures under the law, and points from them to the things signified by them under the Gospel, and under this denomination all the true worship, and true worship∣pers of God are comprehended; and measured with the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> measuring reed, being in the line of the true worship of God and no more, in the next place, here ariseth a question, Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are we to understand by worshipping in the temple, seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="95" REF="002172_0049_0FBC7A4D36D137E8"/>other worship is to be measured within the line of true worship? To which I answer, it is the saints bodys that is the temple of God, as before hath been proved, and not a body of sin, as may be seen, 1 Cor. 3.16, 17, 18. <HI>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you: if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy, for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are; let no man deceive himself,</HI> saith the Apostle; that is, to think that God may be worshiped in a body of sin, for a body of fin is not God's temple; for the temple of God is holy, and God is only to be worshipped in his temple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>For God is a spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth,</HI> Joh. 4.24.

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. But the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not, for it is given unto the Gentiles.</P>
<P>For as in the foregoing verse John was required to mea∣sure them that worshiped in the temple, so likewise in this verse, he is forbidden to measure the court which is with∣out the temple, for it (saith he) is given to the Gentiles. In this book the name <HI>Jews</HI> carries in it the true worshipers of God, and the name <HI>Gentiles</HI> the false; as thus appears, Chap. 2.9. <HI>I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are of the synagogue of satan.</HI> Chap. 3.9. <HI>Behold I will make them of the synagogue of satan, which say they are Jews and are not, but do lie.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the name of the true worshipers are derived from the Jews, because they were God's people under the first Covenant: And the name of the false worshipers who wor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p in the outward court, is derived from the name Gen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, to distinguish the true from the false; and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ith he, But the court which is without the temple east: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and measure it not, for it is given unto the Gentiles. When John was thus required according to the vision, to measure the true Church, and the true worship of God, and the true worshipers, it was in the time when the false Church was in her greatest glory, where with she glorifyed
<PB N="96" REF="002172_0050_0FBC7A4FB6C38800"/>her self, under great pretences of worshipping God, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was all but a form of godliness, in observing days, assem∣bling themselves together, and multiplying prayers with the mouth and lips; and all done in the outward court, not being done in spirit and in truth in the inner man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be cast out, and not to be measured within the line of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worship, for this name Gentiles doth imply the false Church, which persecutes the true, as appears in the following words,</P>
<P>And the holy city shall they tread under foot;</P>
<P>Alluding from old Babylon, who trod Jerusalem under foot, they being Gentiles.</P>
<P>By the holy City we are to understand the true Church alluding from Jerusalem the city of David so called, to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the holy city, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.5. <HI>Neh.</HI> 11.8. <HI>Isai.</HI> 48.2. <HI>Isai.</HI> 32.1. which the Gentiles or false Church treads under foot; for both temple, altar and city, here spoken of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the temple, altar and city where David dwelt; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that city Jerusalem, was a figure of the Church; and the Church of Christ frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the name Jerusalem, al∣luding from that city, as appears by Scripture testimony Chap. 21.9, 10. <HI>And there came unto me one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Angels, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lambs wife; and he shewed me that great city, the holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> salem.</HI> Chap. 21.2. <HI>And John saw the holy city, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a bride adorned for her husband.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the holy city is the true Church and the Gentiles the false, which treadeth the true under foot; and the time of their treading the holy city under foot, is forty and two months, being measured by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which rules the night, because the Gentiles are children of the night, and of darkness. But more may be said a this hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophecy a thou∣sand two hundred and sixty days, cloathed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sackcloth.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="002172_0050_0FBC7A4FB6C38800"/>
Here are several things to be observed from this verse: The first is God's promise to give power to his two witnesses, to prophecy; and secondly, What are we to understand by prophecy? I answer, it is the gift of God, as in the foregoing words, I will give power unto my two witnesses, or I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophecy. So that it appears, none can prophecy but by the gift of God, that is, by the gift of his spirit, for prophecy comes by the revelation of God's spirit; <HI>for no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the holy Ghost,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.3. for it is the spirit of God that reveals him to us to be the Lord; <HI>for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of pro∣phecy,</HI> Chap. 19.10. And thirdly, the time here spoken of their prophecy, is a thousand two hundred and sixty days, which time, reckoning thirty days to a month, makes just forty and two months, which measures the same time that the Gentiles tread the holy city under foot, spoken of in the foregoing verse; for the time of these witnesses pro∣phecy is measured by the day which is ruled by the sun, because they are children of light and of the day; but the Gentiles are children of the night and of darkness, and their time is measured by months or moons. And the fourth thing is their sad and mournful state in the time of this prophecy, which is signified by their being <HI>cloathed in sackcloth.</HI> And fifthly, let us inquire, Who these wit∣nesses be, and why they are called two? Why they are called two, is shewed in the fourth verse; these are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. The Church of Christ is called an olive tree under the first testament, as plainly appears in <HI>Jer.</HI> 11. comparing the 15th verse with the 16th. <HI>What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath committed lewdness with many, &amp;c. The Lord called thy name a green olive tree, fair and of goodly fruit.</HI> Thus it appears the olive tree did figure the Church, as is to be seen also in Rom. 11.24. <HI>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is mild by nature, and wert graffed in contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree.</HI> Thus both the Church of the Jews under the first testament, and the Church of the Gentiles under the new testament,
<PB N="98" REF="002172_0051_0FBC7A51B8FB3820"/>are compared to an olive tree; so that it appears evident∣ly, that the Church of Christ is intended by shore witnesses not only by the two olive trees, but also by the two can∣dlesticks; for the Church of Christ under the old te ta∣ment was represented to Zechariah by a golden candlestick, Zech 4.2. <HI>And he said unto me what seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold.</HI> And also the seven Churches of Asia were represented to John by the seven golden candlesticks, Chap. 1.20. <HI>The seven golden candlesticks are the seven Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears that these witnesses are the Church of Christ; for the olive tree and the candlestick figured no∣thing else in the Scripture but the Church; so that they are very plainly described to be the Church of Christ And sixthly, why are they called two witnesses? I an∣swer, in several respects; for under the law of Moses, two witnesses or three was to establish the matter, Deut. 19 15. <HI>At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established.</HI> And tho' the Church be many witnesses, yet for several reasons they are express'd by the number two, that being a sufficient proof under the law; and for several other reasons as herein.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</P>
<P>They are called two olive trees and two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. They are two in re∣spect of the two natures in union. The oyl doth figure the Spirit of God which is divine; and the stock and branches doth figure the humane nature of Christ, and his Church: And thus in their testimony they are two joint witnesses in every thing they witness to; and therefore their witness is called a prophecy; as for instance, Rom. 8.16. <HI>The spirit it self in us is one, and its bearing witness with our spirit, makes two joint witnesses,</HI> to confirm to us that we are the children of God. And it is said they are two prophets and the two candlesticks, in respect of the two restaments they did testify under, measuring the Church of the Jews under the first testament to be one olive tree, and
<PB N="99" REF="002172_0051_0FBC7A51B8FB3820"/>one candlestick; and the Church under the new testament to be the other olive tree and candlestick, which makes two live trees and two candlesticks, standing before the God of the earth, Zech. 4.2. <HI>I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of Gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps.</HI> This candlestick with the seven lamps upon it, did repre∣present the Church under the old testament: Compare this with the 11th and 12th verses, <HI>What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left side thereof? And I answered again and said unto him, What he these two olive branches, which thro' the two golden pipes empty the golden oyl out of themselves.</HI> Verse 14. <HI>Then said he, these are the two anointed ones, that stand by the God of the whole earth.</HI> And these two anointed ones that stood before the God of the whole earth, was Zerubbabel the Governour, and Joshua the high Priest, who were types of Christ, and were two witnesses under that ministration, who stood before the God of the whole earth, and did represent that union that is between Christ and his Church, they being compared to two olive trees, and two branches, which thro' the two golden pipes empty the golden oyl out of themselves; that is, they were feeders and nourishers of the Church, and types of Christ, who is the chief and great Shepherd, the one of his kingly office, the other of his priestly office; but the two anointed ones in the my ste∣ry that stands before the God of the earth, is Christ and his Church, who are the two anointed ones. Heb. 1.9. <HI>Therefore God, even thy God, hath amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted thee with the oyl of gladness above thy fellows.</HI> 2 Cor. 1 21. <HI>Now he which sta∣blished us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God.</HI> Thus Christ and his Church are the two anointed ones, and the two witnesses which stand before the God of the earth.</P>
<P>But the Church under the old testament was called but one candlestick: the use of the candlestick is to hold the light; and the candlestick that holds the seven lamps, if there be no oyl they can give no light, therefore the olive tree that yields the oyle standing by the candlestick, which candlestick holds up the seven lamps, which hath seven
<PB N="100" REF="002172_0052_0FBC7A5377ABC138"/>pipes to feed the seven lamps; thus it causeth the lamps to give a continual light; thus the mystery of the two natures of Christ is held forth by this figure: The can∣dlestick with its seven lamps holds forth the Church; and the olive tree holds forth Christ's humane nature with his Church, and the golden oyl his divine nature; so that as the oyl that flows from the olive tree, and feeds the lamps, and causeth them to give a continual light; so the Spirit of Christ that flows from himself into his Church, or members, feed and nourish them, so that they become the light of the world: So that Jesus Christ the true olive tree, and his Church in union with him, are the two witnesses that always stand before the God of the earth, and bear witness to the truth: Thus the Spirit and the Bride are cal∣led two olive trees, and two candlesticks, because under two ministrations, to wit, under the old testament and under the new: And thus they stand before the God of the earth, and are the light of the world, bearing witness to the truth which is revealed in them by the Spirit of truth; and therefore their witness is by prophecy, so that Christ and his Church thus in union are called two prophets, and two witnesses; Joh. 18.37. <HI>For this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.</HI> Chap. 1.5. <HI>And from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness.</HI> Acts 1.8. <HI>But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in Judea, and in Sa∣maria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.</HI> Thus God gives power unto his witnesses; as also in Acts 5.32. <HI>And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him:</HI> Here are the two witnesses spoken of in union, to wit, they with the holy Ghost which is in them; for the witness of the holy Ghost which is in them, is the witness of Jesus Christ with his Church; and that which they witness to is that which God hath revealed to them by his Spirit, so that their testimony is by the Spirit of prophecy, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2.20. compared with the <HI>26th and 27th verses,</HI> bearing wit∣ness to the truth, against all false worship set up in the world by the institution, laws and appointments of men,

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and de∣voureth their enemies.</P>
<P>This is to set forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of God against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that hurt his ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, alluding from what was done by blijah, when the king of Israel sent a captain of fifty with his fifty for Elijan; and when he came to him he said unto him, <HI>Thou man of God, the king hath said, come down;</HI> and Elijah answered and said unto the captain of fifty, <HI>If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty; and there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty,</HI> 2 King. 1.9 10.</P>
<P>And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</P>
<P>That is, by the fire that cometh out of their mouth; for God is wont always to denounce his Judgments by the mouth of these witnesses, before he executes them, as he did by the mouth of Elijah. And such warriers as Elijah was, is shewed in the 9th Chap. 18. verse. <HI>By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the breast ne which issued out of their mouths.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their pro∣phecy.</P>
<P>This is an allusion from the prayer of Elijah, who prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And this judgment of famine came upon Israel for the hurt done to the servants of God, in the reign of Ahab king of Israel; and not only this famine, but the utter destructi∣on of Ahab and all his house, and all Baals Priests, and worshippers of Baal, were utterly destroyed in a just judg∣men for the hurt done to the servants of God: And this was done in such a time as this was; for then the
<PB N="102" REF="002172_0053_0FBC7A54B6D5D780"/>two witnesses did prophecy in sackcloth, and the true Church was trodden under foot by Jezabel, who had the same measure after measured to her, who was after trod∣den under foot her self, and eaten up of dogs. But these having power to shut up heaven that it rain not, doth hold forth a mystery in it, altho' it be an allusion from that judgment executed from the mouth of Elijah (1 King. 17.1. <HI>And Elijah said unto Ahab, as the Lord Lord God of Israel liveth, there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word,</HI>) in that God thus shut heaven at his request, that it rained not for three years and six months in that time of false and fruitless doctrine; for there can be no heavenly showers to cause the earth to yield her increase, under the teaching of a false ministry; for in such a time there is a drought, for a false ministry are <HI>clouds without water,</HI> Jude 12. Amos 8.11, 12, 13. <HI>Behold the days come faith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing of the words of the Lord; and they shall wan∣der from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it; in that day shall the fair virgins &amp; young men faint for thirst.</HI> For all the heavenly showers of fruitfulness is by the prophecy that comes by the Spirit of God, and not by a vision of the immagination of a mans own heart, but by the prophecy of the two witnesses, which is the Spirit and the Bride, out of whose belly flows rivers of living waters, and watereth the earth; for they only are the light of the world. And faith the Apostle,</P>
<P>These have power over water to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</P>
<P>This is an allusion from what Moses and Aaron did in Egypt, who turned the waters of Egypt into blood, and smote the Egyptians with all those great plagues, in a just judgment for the oppression and cruelty done to the disraelites: And this prophecy is to shew, that God is the same God, ready to execute his judgments on them that hurt his witnesses, as if it were done at their will. And
<PB N="103" REF="002172_0053_0FBC7A54B6D5D780"/>whereas it is said they have power over waters to turn them to blood, it doth speak a mystery; for as the doctrine of the two witnesses, which is the word of their prophecy, doth teach love, patience, and self denial, to love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur enemies, and to do good to them that have us: So the doctrine of the teachers of the false Church, which they pretend to be to the glory of God, is to shed the blood of all those that will not conform to their laws of wor∣ship, and prescribed rules of the same, under pretence of punishing hereticks, and thus to destroy all those that will not drink of the waters of the fountain of their doctrine; which waters shall be turned into blood, and they themselves made to drink of it; as in Chap. 16.5, 6. <HI>And I heard the Angels of the waters say. Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and which wast, and shalt be, because thou hast thus judg∣ed, for they have shed the blood of saints. and Prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7. And when they shall have fini∣shed their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war against them, and shall overcome them and kill them.</P>
<P>In the third verse of this chapter the Lord promised to give power unto these two witnesses in their sad and afflict∣ed state, and that they should prophecy under their mourn∣ful and sackcloth attire, a thousand two hundred and sixty days. Now in this verse is shewed what will be the effect of their testimony, to wit, When they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them. This beast is Antichrist <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the false Church: Mention is made of the rising of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east out of the bottomless pit in the fore part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nth Chapter, under the name of locusts, having a king over them whose name is Apollyon, that is, a destroyer. And here in this verse we have an account of the aforesaid beast making war against these two witnesses upon the finishing of their testimony: These two witnesses were de∣scribed who they were, by plain descriptions in the fourth verse, to wit, Christ and his Church in union, who bear
<PB N="104" REF="002172_0054_0FBC7A5888A21540"/>a true and faithful testimony before the God of the earth the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣ing their testimony, make war against them. This beast coming out of the bottomless pit, is to describe the rising of An∣tichrist, or the false Church, and making war against the true Church, which is in union with Christ: Up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearing the witnesses faithful testimony against their false doctrine, they make war against the witnesses and over∣come them, and kill them; thus the war began upon the faithful and true testimony given by Christ and his Church against the doctrine and practice of the false Church. To like example we find under the old testament, that su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an unjust war began upon the like testimony against Apol∣lyons Ministry, as is to be seen, Mic 3.5. <HI>Thus faith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry peace; and he that putteth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into their mouth, they even prepare war against him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 8. And their dead bodys shall lye is the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom, and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</P>
<P>As the the true and faithful Church and Spouse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, was called the hoty City in the second verse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the false Church which ascended out of the bottomless pit is come to be so great and numerous, that she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called the great City; and in the street of this great city which is spiritually called Sodom, and Egypt, &amp; where all our Lord was crucified, is the dead bodys of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seen to lye, when they by persecution had killed them because of their testimony against their pride Sodom like and against her oppression Egypt like, and against her per∣secution like, where also our Lord was crucified. Thus the Gentiles tread the holy city under foot, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church the true. The reason why the false Church is spirits ally called Sodom, and Egypt, and where also our Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> crucifyed, is to shew her unholy state: And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church called the holy City trodden under foot, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her holy and afflicted state.</P>

By these waters we are to understand wholso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> doctrine, by which the Church was nourished: And the star falling from heaven, doth denote a falling of the ministry from their heavenly station; and thereby imbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ing in a great measure these living fountains by which the Church was before nourished; so that now there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>∣ing and dying from that spiritual life which before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lived in; and thereupon the glorious light of the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was much eclipsed, which was proclaimed by the soun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the next or fourth trumpet, and measured by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> moon and stars being in part darkned: And upon the so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ing of the fifth trumpet, a total falling away was represent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by a star falling from heaven to the earth; and that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the bottomless pit was opened, and that the sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> air was darkned with the smoke that came out of it: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which sheweth, that by this great apostacy, the glorio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>And thus the true Church was consumed in a wilder∣ness state, being mixed with the false; so that we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o account that any testimony was born against the false Church, or those locusts, till after the sound of the sixth trumper, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we have an account of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> number that was loosed from under the doctrine and dominion of mystical Babylon, by atonement made by Jesus Christ the High Priest, a voice calling to the Angel which had the sixth trumpet to loose the four Angels bound in the great river Euphrases; and upon this voice from the place of atonement they were loosed, and prepared to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadiners for war by the testimony of their mouths as is said of them; after, if any man will hurt thom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pro∣ceedeth our of their mouth, and dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ureth their enemies; they being also called the holy city, and two witnesses, as they are in union with Christ, prophecying in sackcloth. And the false Church is called the beast that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of the bottomiess pit, that made war against them, and the great city spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, and where our Lord was crucified.</P>
<P>Thus the true Church is described to be in a poor, low, miserable, and perishing state, and the false Church in great pomp, and very numerous making war against he witnesses, and overcoming them, and killing them; thus wasting and consuming them, so that there is nothing to be seen in the street of mystical Babylon or the false Church, after they have killed the witnesses, but dead bodies; there is to life of Godliness to be seen in her street, all her pre∣tended worship is external things; it is all dead service and vain worship, works of their own hands. But the Lord is coming upon them speedily as a thief in the night, while they are rejoycing and making merry themselves over the dead bodies of the witnesses, which stood before the God of the earth, and are the golden candlesticks which hold
<PB N="110" REF="002172_0057_0FBC7A5F1D731BB8"/>up the light to the world; but now being killed by the false Church, their dead bodies lie in her street, not being put in graves, the earth being now covered with darknes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the people with gross darkness.</P>
<P>But the last foregoing verses, to wit, the 7th, 8th, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and 10th, doth contain a great mystery; for upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apostacy, or falling away of the true Church, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sing up of the false out of the bottomless pit, the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did so multiplp and increase, that they became a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kingdom in the world; and the true Church went into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wilderness, being bewilder'd with the superstition, here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and hypocrisy of the false Church; so that she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her testimony, and then the false Church got the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hand in war against her; and thus was she overcome and killed mystically in her testimony, being despised, underva∣lued, and trodden under foot, <HI>v.</HI> 2. The false Church thus warring against her testimony, did overcome her and did kill her, for the testimony of the true Church ever was, and is, and will be, by the revelation of the Spirit of Christ; and her ministers preaching is all by the revela∣tion of the spirit of Christ which dewlleth in them (<HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 1.11.12.2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.29, 30.) and openeth their understanding to understand the Scriptures. But the ministers of the fall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church, preach only feigned words which they study 2 Pet. 2.3. <HI>Even the magination of their own heart, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the revelation of Gods spirit,</HI> Jer. 23.21. Jer. 14.14. Ezek. 13.2, 3.</P>
<P>And thus the false Church got the upper hand, by over∣coming the true Church; and thus was she killed in the mystery. And by their dead bodies lying in the street of the great city, is to shew, that as the true Church did de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and die, and the false Church did rise up in her room, there was no life nor spirit of truth in her; so that nothing was to be seen in her street but the dead bodies of the witnesses; for there remained only a form of godliness which she upheld and carried on, being only an outwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shew of worshiping God, the worshipers being all dead in sin, and in a polluted state of uncleanness; and all that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do is only an imitation of the saints, of what they saw ex∣ternally
<PB N="111" REF="002172_0057_0FBC7A5F1D731BB8"/>with their carnal eyes, and heard with their carnal ears; so that in the street of this great city, or territories of the false Church, is to be seen nothing but the dead bodies of the saints, for there is no spirit nor life of righ∣teousness in them; for as the body is dead without the spirit, so all their works of worship is done without the works of faith, so that it is all only like the dead bo∣dies of the saints, when the life and spirit is gone out of them; for could the inside of this Church be seen, it would appear like Sodom and Egypt, and as bad as the Jews which crucified our Lord, and therefore her name is de∣rived from them, and Babylon; and when her fall shall come, then it will be seen what was in her inside when he was in her pomp and glory; to wit, her body was then <HI>the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit;</HI> as may be seen in Chap. 18.2. for all that she doth is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en of men externally, as preaching, praying, singing holy men's psalms, and practising the ordinances of Christ after one fashion or other, and observing of Sabaths and holy days, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.16. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.10, 11. And all this proceeding from a sinful and polluted inside; so that in the street or territo∣ries of the false Church is only dead bodies, finely arrayed outwardly; being <HI>deck'd with silver, and gold, and procious stone,</HI> Chap. 17. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> So that she is become a glorious Church in the sight of the world, great and beautiful, alluring both kings and all the inhabitants of the earth to joyn in with her; as may be seen, Chap. 17.2. So that she hath both rulers and judges to support and uphold her in what∣soever kingdom or country she is in, as may be seen, Chap, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.3.</P>
<P>And whereas it saith, And they of the people, and kin∣dreds, and nations, shall see their dead bodies, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. By seeing their dead bodies, is intended that dead form of godliness before mentioned, which they behold and see with their carnal eyes, which is here represented by the dead bodies of the saints, they having killed the living saints: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he false Church always glories in the outward form of Godliness; for that is that which they will not have bu∣tied,
<PB N="112" REF="002172_0058_0FBC7A61934C2F80"/>which was represented to John by their not suffering the dead bodies to be put in graves: For it is only the spirit and life of Christianity that the old serpent called the Devil and Satan strikes at, <HI>who decerves the whole world,</HI> Chap. 12.9. but he is blinding the eyes of the kings and judges of the earth, by suggesting into them, to main∣tain and uphold the form, or dead body, without the life; for he knows that that is all that judges can do; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this means he knows he can war against the life and spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Christianity, and bring all the world to attend, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worship the form without the life: And thus it is the dear body only that the false Church rejoyces over, and make them selves merry with, &amp; this is the course of life that both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mother of harlots and her daughters leads, even to this day; for it was, and is the spirit of life in the saints that dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> always torment them that dwell upon the earth, and not the bodies of the saints without the spirit; for the saints testimony was always against the false Churches form without the spirit of life in it; and the false Church is wont always to persecute the true Church, for refusing to attend her form, or image of Godliness; for the judges of the earth can bring all the inhabitants of the earth is their territories to attend their form of Godliness, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worship the image of Godliness which they set up, as none but the true Church refuses, or suffers under them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evil doers: for the world will hear the false prophets th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scripture saith, but they will not hear the true saith th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scripture; and therefore by this saith the scripture we know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the false from the true: And by this direction, the scripture tells us, we may know what spirit the prophet is in, whether in the Spirit of God, or in the Spirit of the World, for if he comes in the Spirit of the world, <HI>then the world will hear him,</HI> but if he comes not in the Spirit of the world, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the world will not hear him, for the world knoweth him not</HI> saith the scripture, 1 Joh. 3.1. <HI>Therefore the world knoweth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not, because it knew not him.</HI> 1 Joh. 4. comparing the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> verse with the fifth and sixth verses. <HI>Beloved, believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God.

<P>Thus we have an account of the sad afflicted state of the Church of Christ, under her great sufferings and of long continuance.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 11. And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</P>
<P>This time here expressed by three days and an half, doth measure the whole time of the Churches sorrowful and afflicted state, and the time of the false Churches insulting and triumphing over them; the state of the true Church be∣ing like the state of Israel of old, when Jerusalem was trodden under foot of the Gentiles, and Israel under the power and dominion of old Babylon; and the City, Tem∣ple, and Altar being all trodden under foot, and Israel that was in captivity compared unto the valley of dry bones, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37, which dry bones was said to be the whole house of Israel; as in the 11th verse.</P>
<P>Thus the spiritual Israel of God is express'd to be under the same circumstances, to wit, killed, and their dead bodys to ly in the street of the great city, and after three days and an half the spirit of life entered into them, and they stood upon their feet. Thus it was said of Israel of old in captivity, in the 5th verse, <HI>Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones, behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</HI> And thus it is exprest of the true and faithful Church of God, how that the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet: This is the day of their salvation and deliverance. This is the time of putting off their sackcloth garments. Now they that have been long trod under foot stand on their feet, and it is said great fear fell on them that saw them; and well it might, for the effect of their fear will be speedy destruction that is coming upon them.</P>

<HI>Verse</HI> 12. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, come up hither.</P>
<P>Thus their comforts increase, they are not only set up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their feet by the spirit of life from God entering into them but they are now invited into heaven out of the reach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Enemies: This is to set forth their advancement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dignity from one degree of exaltation to another.</P>
<P>And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them.</P>
<P>This was a very solemn and awful sight for their enemie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to behold, to see those whom they had been persecuting and accusing for <HI>hereticks, pestilent fellows, sowers of sedition troublers of the common wealth;</HI> yea, esteemed of them to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>filth and offscouring of all things,</HI> pretending themselves to be the true Church; and now to behold and see them whom they had thus despised to be favourites of hea∣ven, and to be advanced into such great glory; this is a dreadful day for them to behold.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 13. And the same hour was there are great earthquake.</P>
<P>And well might this great earthquake be upon these ene∣mies of Gods Church, to see them whom they had been treading under their feet, now ascend up into heaven in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cloud in their open sight; but it is a joyful day to God elect, and a day of trembling to their enemies, to behold their advancement. <HI>And the same hour was there a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> earthquake,</HI></P>
<P>And the tenth part of the city fell.</P>
<P>Thus we see that when the time comes that the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> church shall rise and stand up on her feet, and be advanced into a higher degree of glory, then the false Church most fall.</P>
<P>In the 8th verse this city was called spiritual Sodom and Egypt, and where our Lord was crucified, and in the 17th Chapter, comparing the 6th verse with the 18th, and the will shew this city to be intended the false Church; Verse <HI>And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the the saint and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.</HI> Verse 18, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>And in the earthquake were slain names of men seven thousand.</P>
<P>By names of men, we are to understand those names of titles that was put upon the heads and leaders of this false Church, which were names of dignity, in naming themselves with those names which the Spirit of God had put upon his ministers and officers of his Church. And the number seven we are to under∣stand, measures the whole of every thing that it expresseth by that number; so that whereas it saith, <HI>And in the earth∣quake were slain names of men seven thousand,</HI> is not to be understood their persons were slain, but is to be under∣stood all those names of titles, which was falsely imposed upon her ministers and Church officers, which did properly belong only to the true Church; for before this time, the mountain of the false Church was exalted above the moun∣tain of the true Church, but now the mountain of the true Church is exalted above the mountain of the false; so that all those names which men imposed upon the false Church, while they were under a delusion taking the false for the true, and the true for the false; but now the mountain of the house of the Lord being exalted above the top of the mountains, it now appears that the false Church had only the names of men, and was not the true Church, but was a cheat; so that all those names of honour and dignity, put upon her by men, who took her for the true Church, are now, upon the rising of the true Church and ascending into dignity, all those names of men are slain at once, and she discovered to be a cheat, that was so renowned for the true, and exalted with names of dignity, piety, vertue, learning, and whatsoever else was ascribed unto her in way of praise or commendation, it being all only names of men imposed

<P>And the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</P>
<P>Thus we are now come to the period of the false Church, and to the glory and advancement of the true: Now we are come to the end of the sixth trumpet, which was the second wo trumpet.</P>

<P>Saying, the kingdoms of this world are be∣come the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Thus they render praise and thanks unto God, in that he had subdued the kingdoms of this world, and brought them into subjection to himself, and unto his Christ, that is, his anointed, whom he hath anointed to be King of kings and Lord of lords, who shall reign for ever and ever.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 16. And the twenty four elders which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces and worshiped God.</P>
<P>These twenty four elders do represent the state of all saints who shall sit in judgment with God, to judge the world.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>This Chapter consists of two Visions that the A∣postle John saw, one of the Church, beginning at the primitive Jewish Church of Christ, and continued until the Church went into the wilderness; As also a vision of the great red dragon from his first being such a one, and his great dominion over the whole world, which he got by usurpation; and his continual enmity against the woman, or Church of Christ, and her seed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>ANd there appeared a great wonder in hea∣ven, a woman cloathed with the sun, and the moon under her feet.</P>
<P>This woman is the Church of God; and her being cloathed with the sun, doth shew that she is the light of the world, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.14. And she being thus adorned with the glorious light of the sun, which rules the day, and swallows up the light of the moon; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much more ex∣cellent in brigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, that the moon is said to be under her feet as useless.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="002172_0062_0FBC7A67C24D5EE8"/>
And upon her head a crown of twelve stars.</P>
<P>The crown of twelve stars doth represent the twelve sons of Jacob, which that Church was crowned withal, Jacob was represented to Joseph by the <HI>Sun,</HI> and his mo∣ther who was under subjection to Jacob by the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and Joseph with his eleven brethren to <HI>Twelve Stars,</HI> Gen. 37.9. For these twelve stars are twelve Angels, or the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel, Chap. 21.12. <HI>And at the gates twelve Angels, and names written there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And she being with child, cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be deli∣vered.</P>
<P>This woman was with child by her covenanted husband, as is written. Isai. 54.5. <HI>For thy maker is thy husband, the Lord of hosts is his name.</HI> Jer. 2.2. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, I remember the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espos∣sals.</HI> Ezek. 16.8. <HI>Now when I passed by thee and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love, and I spread my skirt over thee; and covered thy nakedness; yea. I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord, and thou becamest mine.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was the woman with child, and her Maker <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her husband that begat this child that this woman trava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed withal, and pained to be delivered; and when her time was fully come, as appears, Gal. 4.4. <HI>And when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his son <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a woman, made under the law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold a great red dragon.</P>
<P>It is said both these wonders was seen in heaven.

<P>Having seven heads, and ten horns, and se∣ven crowns on his heads.</P>
<P>His seven heads and seven crowns on his seven heads, doth shew him to be crowned with all the dominion of this world; for the seven heads doth measure the whole dominion of this world, and the seven crowns doth shew that he is crowned therewith, and the ten horns doth shew that he hath many persecuting powers arising out of these heads, <HI>Luk.</HI> 4.5, 6.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth.</P>

By a time is a thousand, and times is two hundred, and half a time is sixty: This is a very sorrowful time with the true Church, as Israels was in the wilderness: This is the time of the two witnesses prophecying in sackcloth: This is the time of her great Apostacy, and a mixture with the false Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho is always in a wilderness state, Chap. 17.3. <HI>So he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and I saw a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast.</HI> This woman is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lse Church, with whom the true is mixt and bewilder'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s appears in the 18th Chapter, verse 4. <HI>Come out of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceive not of her plagues.</HI></P>

<P>Thus he begins with new stratagems (having gottes a wounded head) to carry away the woman by craft and de∣ceit, with his poisonable serpentine heresies and false doct∣rine to deceive, as a flood of waters to carry away the woman therewith, by reproaching the way of truth and sound doctrine, and reviling those that profess the same, accusing them with all manner of evil falsely to make them odious, and to be hated of all men. Thus by these stra∣tagems he persecutes the Church in the wilderness, and by feigning flatteries, to entice her to worldly pleasures an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carnal delights, after riches, honours, and pleasures of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> world.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>ANd I stood upon the sand of the sea.</P>
<P>Thus it appeared unto John in his vision, as if he stood on the sand of the sea; so that he had a fair prospect to behold the face of the waters.</P>
<P>And I saw a beast rise out of the sea.</P>
<P>This beast is the kingdoms of this world, and more par∣ticularly the Roman kingdom, who had rule at that time. And by the waters is meant <HI>peoples and multitudes, and nations and tongues,</HI> as appears Chap. 17.15. <HI>Jer.</HI> 51.53. And by the <HI>heads of the boast</HI> is meant the dominion of this world: And the number <HI>seven</HI> measures the whole dominion or government of this world: And the <HI>ten horns</HI> is to express many kingly powers that ariseth out of the seven heads; for it is said in Chap. 17.9, 10. <HI>The seven heads are seven mountains, and the seven mountains</HI> represent all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dominion and dignity of this world: And there are seven kings, and the seven kings measures all the visible domi∣nion of this world; and in the 12th verse of the 17th Chapter it is said, <HI>the ten horns are ten kings,</HI> that is, there are many kings that ariseth out of the seven heak, and where a king is there is power; for whereas it is said, <HI>and upon his horns ten crowns,</HI> which is to shew the ten kings or horns are crown'd with power. <HI>And upon his heads the names of blasphemy;</HI> and this was to shew that the powers of this world in heathenism and antichristi∣anism, hath been wont to <HI>reproach both God and his taber∣nacle,</HI> or Church, as in the 6th verse.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="002172_0067_0FBC7A75058D14E0"/>
<HI>Verse</HI> 2. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.</P>
<P>Thus God represents the kingly powers of this world by the most fiercest wild beasts, who are fierce and strong, and able thereby to destroy and overcome the beasts of the earth. And the Prophet Daniel Chap. 7. saw the like vision of the four Monarchs, represented to him by the like fierce beasts; but Daniel prophecied in the first Monarch, and John in the time of the last. Now these kings and powers were set up by God to do justice and judgment among the inha∣bitants of the earth. And this beast here spoken of is not yet represented to John of a scarlet colour, because its power is of God, according to Paul's testimony, Rom. 13.1, &amp;c. <HI>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God, the powers that are ordained of God.</HI> This Apostle is speaking of the same power that John is prophecying of, to wit, the Roman kingdom then ruling.</P>
<P>And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</P>
<P>The beast receiving his power from the dragon, and ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cising it, becomes a scarlet coloured beast, as doth appear in Chap. 17.3. for we read of this dragon and his power in Chap. 12.3. <HI>And behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.</HI> This dragon is that old serpent called the devil and satan, <HI>Chap.</HI> 12.9. Yea, he is the God of this world, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.30. And was a murderer from the beginning, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.44. and therefore may well be called the <HI>red dragon.</HI> This dragon offered to give to our Saviour all his dominion and glory here spoken of, upon condition that he would <HI>fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewn and worship him,</HI> Luk. 4.5, 6, 7. but he refuseth to purchase it upon those terms; but the beast <HI>receiveth it</HI> of him: And the dragon thus giving to the beast <HI>his power, and his seat, and great authority,</HI> he now becomes a persecuting power, by this power derived from the dragon, and there∣by establisheth false worship.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="002172_0068_0FBC7A7675D470F8"/>
<HI>Verse</HI> 3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death.</P>
<P>This was one of the seven heads of the dragon which he gave to the beast; for that power which is derived from God is not to be wounded, but is to continue to the worlds end: Now if the dragon had not the dominion of this world, he could not be the god of it. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.4. And this wound was given him by the glorious light of the Gospel, after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, being spread among the Gentiles, and by the sword of God put into the hand of Constantine, to the overthrow of that persecuting power, derived from the dragon, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the hand of the Romish heathenish power, who stood to mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tain the worshipping of idols, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asphemed God and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under whose power the ten first persecutions was ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on. And this overthrow was upon the sound of the second t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣pet.</P>
<P>And his deadly wound was healed.</P>
<P>And the healing of this wound was by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling away of the true Church, and by the rising up of the false, by which antichrist got a head, and by this means the deadly wound was healed, for now the false Church was taken for the true, and the true for the false; and thus the dragons pow∣er was revived and his head healed, and all the world wondred after the beast; for now all the world concluded it was a Christian power that ruled, <HI>for the dragon d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣veth the whole world,</HI> Chap. 12.9.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. And they worshipped the drago<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which gave power to the beast, and they wor∣shipped the beast.</P>
<P>This is to be understood thus: The power which the dragon gives the beast is given under pretennce of setting up the true worship of God, and requiring all people to attend it: The children of this world being in darkness, take the ordinances, institutions, doctrines and command∣ments of men, to be the true worship of God, Mat. 15.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the

Rom. 14.17, 18. <HI>For the kingdom of God is righteousness and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost; for he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</HI> So that whatsoever is set up by man in way of worship, pretending to worship God is from the power of the dragon, and is but a del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding form or image of worship; by which the inhabitants of the earth are de∣luded by the dragon, and by this wile. He persecutes the true worshippers of God, that worship him through the gift of his own Spirit, which he hath given them to worship him with, in faith and love; which faith and love is his own gift, given to us by his own Spirit to worship him with; according to what is written, 2 Cor. 4.13. <HI>We having the same spirit of faith:</HI> For it is the Spirit that gives us faith, and <HI>without faith it is impossible to
<PB N="134" REF="002172_0069_0FBC7A798312E168"/>please God</HI> (Heb. 11.6.) or to worship him: So that all pretended worship to God set up by man, is only worship∣ing the dragon and the beast, and no true worship to God, but a provocation to him; for it is done only with the mouth and lips, and acts of the creatures own acting, and not done in the spirit of truth but in obedience to the commandments and doctrines of men; saying, who is li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto the beast? as if they should say, who can withstand the commandments of a king? who is able to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with him?</P>
<P>Thus the dragon and the beast can keep in subjection the whole world under false worship, they not seeing the invisible God, who only is to be worshipped and feared above all: So that it looks to them who are the worshipers of the dragon and the beast, who is able to withstand the whole world, when as <HI>this is the victory that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣meth the world, even our faith,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.4.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things, and blasphe∣mies.</P>
<P>This gift was given him by the dragon, to speak great threatnings to all that would not subject to his ordinan∣ces, commandments and institutions of worship, reproach∣ing or blaspheming the saints for refusing subjection there∣unto; for tho' the saints are few in number, yet they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the light of the world,</HI> Mat. 5.14.

<P>This time of persecution is measured by the moon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> months, because antichrist rules in the night, and in da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ness, they being children of the night, and of darkness and this power which was given unto him to make war with the saints, was a limited time to him by God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prest by forty two months, but it <HI>doth not belong to us to know the times and seasons, which the father hath p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into his own power,</HI> Acts 1.7.

<PB N="135" REF="002172_0069_0FBC7A798312E168"/>it is said the Gentiles shall tread the holy city under foot, that is these Antichrists, in conjunction with the Magistra∣tical powers of this world: for the holy city is God's Church, which the Gentiles, or these Antichristians tread under foot, chap. 21.9.10. <HI>And there came unto me one of the seven Angels, and talked with me saying, come hither, I will shew thee the Bride the Lambs wife, and he shewed me that great city the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. And he opened his mouth in blas∣phemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</P>
<P>By blaspheming his tabernacle is his <HI>Church,</HI> which is the <HI>true tabernacle of God, which he hath pitched and not man.</HI> Heb. 8.2. for in this tabernacle is God's habitation and dwelling place, which was figured out by that tabernacle pitched in the wilderness.

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints.</P>
<P>This power was given him by the dragon.</P>
<P>And to overcome them.</P>
<P>This speaks of such a time when Antichrist rules in great pomp and glory and did overcome the saints, for this was the time when the false Church said in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow, at this time the true Church was troden under foot of the Gentiles. And this beast that did ascend out of the earth,</P>
<P>Did overcome them, and kill them; and power was given unto him over all kindreds and tongues and nations.</P>

This is to shew a general act of requirement to all sorts and degrees of persons whatsoever to yield obediencce, and to worship said image; which image is a prescribed form of Godliness.

<P>And by this number is all his false worship numbered by; for the worshipers thereof never come to any rest; for it is like the six days labour without a Sabbath and therefore it is the most suitablest number to number him by.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>We have had an account in the former part of this book, that after the great spreading of the Gospel, that was by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, and their successors among the Gentiles, that there followed a very great apostacy and degene∣rating from the truth, and a rising of antichrist and false prophets, and overspreading the world; so that by them the true Church was trodden under foot; and the false taken for the true, and the true for the false; so that the true Church bath prophesied in a sad and mournful state all this time of antichrists reign, even whilst the false Church hath been arayed in purple, and scarlet colour, and decked with gold, and precious stone, and pearls; even all this time hath the true Church prophecyed in a mournful and sad state, cloathed in sackcloth, and trodden under foot by the false Church: But it is certain, that the time is coming, that the false Church shall go into perdition and destruction, and that the true Church shall arise and stand upon her feet,
<PB N="146" REF="002172_0075_0FBC7A8547DBFE50"/>to the great terror of her enemies; a relation whereof will begin in this Chapter of her rising and standing, and of the false Churches falling to her utter ruination and destruction.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>ANd I looked, and lo a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred and forty and four thousand, having his father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name written in their foreheads.</P>
<P>This lamb doth set forth Jesus Christ, to be the redeem∣er, or lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world, and this company with him, doth represent all his redeem∣ed ones, as appears in Chap. 22.4. Chap. 9.4. And his standing on mount Sion with the hundred and forty &amp; four thousand, is to shew and set forth their unmoveable stand∣ing; even on the mountain of God, it alluding from the mount upon which the city of David stood, who was a type of Christ; and the Spirit of God in the Scripture doth sometimes set forth the unmoveable standing of such as stand by faith, by expressing their standing by this un∣moveable mountain, as in Psal. 125.1. <HI>They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever;</HI> and so the author to the Hebrews, Heb. 12.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and to the city of the living God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he speaks because they were come to God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> faith, and so stood upon the mountain of God's strength being citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, which stands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the spiritual mount Sion; and the' here is a certain num∣ber named, yet these do represent all God's faithful saints; and as we have an account in the former Chapter of the beasts vassals, that had his mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, to shew whose they were, and whom they worship, so these have the lambs fathers name written i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their foreheads, to show whose they are, and whom the worship.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="002172_0075_0FBC7A8547DBFE50"/>
This book doth frequently allude from those temporal figures under the first testament, to express spiritual things by which they figured, for they were not all Israel that were of Israel; so that this number is exprest to be those that were sealed in the seventh Chap. of this book, verse 4. <HI>And I heard the number of them which were sealed, &amp; there were sealed a hun∣dred and forty and four thousand.</HI> This number doth mea∣sure the whole number of God's elect, standing on mount Sion with the lamb, being sealed in their foreheads, or his fathers name written there, to shew whose they are, and whom they worship, standing on the mount of God Al∣mighty; but the false Church standeth on the seven moun∣tains or dominion of this world, Chap. 17.9. <HI>The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.</P>
<P>This is to set forth the praises of this heavenly host, praising God with innumerable voices, like the noise of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder. This is to set forth their great joy and consolation after their great sufferings, who now shine forth in the world as lights, tho' they had been long trod under foot of the Gentiles.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. And they sung as it were a new song before the throne; and before the four beasts and the elders, and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</P>
<P>This new song was the song of victory, they having ob∣tained deliverance from the power of their enemies. And now standing on mount Sion with the Lamb of God, and being seal'd with his holy Spirit, they thus sing before his throne, and before the four beasts, or holy Angels, and the elders which are twenty four in number, whose names may
<PB N="148" REF="002172_0076_0FBC7A8638AF42D0"/>be read, being written on the twelve gates of the new Jerusalem, and the twelve foundations of that city: And no man could learn that song, saith he, but the hundred a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forty and four thousand which were redeemed from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earth. This is to be understood by the precious blood of the Lamb, which standeth with them on mount Sion; see it is the song of their redemption from sin, and from the wrath of God, and from the power of their persecut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and therefore not to be learned by any out of that state, which they are in.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. These are they which are not de∣filed with women, for they are virgins.</P>
<P>Yea, such as are fit to be espoused to Christ, for they have not defiled themselves with whoredom with the beast, but have kept their virginity.</P>
<P>And follow the Lamb whithersoever he go∣eth.</P>
<P>For they are his redeemed ones, being redeemed from among men by his precious blood from their vain conver∣sation; and these being those that first separated from wor∣shiping the beast and his image, and it being upon the rising &amp; standing up of the true Church, after so long a time of apostacy, they are said to be the <HI>first fruit unto God, and to the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault before the throne of God,</P>
<P>Thus it appears that in their mouth was found no guile, that is, no hypocritical paryers, by flattery pretending to honour God with their mouth and lips, as hypocrites do when their heart is far from God. But in <HI>these were fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no guile, for they are without fault before the throne of God.</HI> This is in the time of the sixth trumpet.</P>
<P>This fore part of the Chapter now gone through, speaks particularly of a vision that John had of the appearing of the Lamb of God, and his company, and standing upon the mount Sion; these are the two witnesses which stand before the God of the earth, and two prophets, and is
<PB N="149" REF="002172_0076_0FBC7A8638AF42D0"/>their mouth was found no guile, for they are without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit before the throne of God. And now the Apostle is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tering upon the discovery of another vision which he had which followed the above said vision.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. And I saw another Angel flie in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nidst of heaven, having the everlasting Gos∣pel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth.</P>
<P>He calls this another angel, in respect that it repre∣sents the first preaching of the everlasting Gospel, after so long a time of apostacy, and upon the true Churches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst rising and coming out of her wilderness strate; for before this time, even in the time of the false Churches glory, there was only false and fruitless doctrine preach'd, by the beast that came out of the earth with two horns like a lamb, which did represent the rising up of the false pro∣phets. But now there did appear ministers that did preach the gospel of God openly, as by the vision is held forth, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying in the midst of heaven,</HI> that is, by open, publick pro∣clamation, as saith Christ, Mat. 10.27. <HI>And what ye hear in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that preach ye upon the house tops.</HI> The vision of this An∣gel preaching the everlasting Gospel, unto them that dwell on the earth, <HI>and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</HI> doth hold forth, that as there was a time when the dragon did deceive the whole world, by bringing them to worship the image of the beast, even all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond; so now the time is come, that the everlasting Gospel is now begun to be preached to all nations, and the mystery of iniquity is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> discovery, and by preaching the gospel to them that dwell on the earth, is meant to earthly men, even to such as worship the beast and his image. This was in the time of the first reformers.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7. Saying with a loud voice, fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come, and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="002172_0077_0FBC7A87DA988090"/>
This verse contains the matter of the Gospel which said Angel did preach, saying with a loud voice to the wor∣shipers of the beast and his image, fear God and give glo∣ry to him; signifying to them, that the hour of his judg∣ment is come, and therefore exhorts them to worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 8. And there followed another Angel saying, Babylon is fallen is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</P>
<P>This verse is to shew what followed the preach∣ing of the everlasting Gospel, to wit, the fall of Babylon; and by Babylon's fall we are not to understand any visible city to fall, but the false Church; for her situation is among all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, where the gospel was preached, as in the foregoing verse. To every nation, kindred and tongue; for as the name of the true Church of Christ is derived from Jerusalem where the temple and alta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was erected; so the false Churches name is derived from old Babylon, who took Jerusalem and led them into Capti∣vity; so that both the true Church &amp; the false bear the name of a woman, and a city, but it is the members of each Church that is intended. And the reason of her fall is ren∣dred, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. By the wine of her fornication which she made all nations to drink of, is intended her begui∣ling them by her false worship, they drinking in her false doctrine, and so joining in with her fornication. And thus by her enticing allurements to her false worship, brought all nations under the wrath of God; for both the king<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the inhabitants of the earth have been alway wont to be deceived by the false Church; and so to join in with her in her fornication, as appears Chap. 17.2. <HI>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="002172_0077_0FBC7A87DA988090"/>
<HI>Verse</HI> 9. And the third Angel followed them, saying with a loud voice if any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the beast and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mage, and receive his mark in his forehead or hand,</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 10. The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indigna∣tion; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</P>
<P>From hence we may note, how God threatens his severe judgments with a loud voice, since his Church begins to arise and stand upon her feet, saying, <HI>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the Cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone, in the presence of his holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</HI> This is to express his fiery anger against them, and to set forth their perpetual tor∣ment, in the presence of those holy angeis and of that Lamb which we before read of standing on mount Sion; and he expresseth their torment to be as if it were with burning fire and brimstone.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 11. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</P>
<P>Thus God makes open proclamation beforehand, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternal punishment which he hath before determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>flict upon false worshipers to all eternity; so that they shall have no rest day nor night, for the smoke of their tor∣ment ascendeth up for ever &amp; ever, saith he. Thus all false worshippers are threatned, who flatter God with their mouth and lips by customary prayers, to be seen of men; and
<PB N="152" REF="002172_0078_0FBC7A8A763D5C58"/>solemn meetings attended with dead services, and obser∣vations of Sabbaths, all being done only by an outside shew, while the inside is defiled with sin; all this is but worshiping the beast and his image, making clean only the outside of the cup and platter, being all but dead service, and a provocation and aggravation to God's anger, by which those forementioned torments and everlasting pu∣nishments of a restless state are procured, and yet done under pretence of worshiping God.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 12. Here is the patience of the saints, here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</P>
<P>The apostle having in the foregoing verse shewed what terrible judgments he had denounc'd against the worshipe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the beast and his image, is now come, as will appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the two following verses, to set forth the great reward that shall be given to the saints.</P>
<P><HI>Here is the patience of the saints,</HI> saith he, <HI>here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus:</HI> As if he should say, here I will give you an account what will be the effect and fruit of the patient suffering of the saints, and of them that keep the commandments of God &amp; the faith of Jesus; for I heard what their reward shall be by a voice from heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 13. And I heard a voice from heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saying unto me, Write, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labour, and their works do follow them.</P>
<P>We may note from hence, that as the saints labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under great persecution and sufferings, patiently, in the exercise of faith, even unto death; they thus dying in the Lord, from henceforth, yea saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.</P>
<P>The following part of this Chapter sheweth the execu∣tion of Gods judgments upon the enemies of his Church by the similitude of a vintage, which followeth the harvest
<PB N="153" REF="002172_0078_0FBC7A8A763D5C58"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the true Church is now rising, so the false Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now falling.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 14. And I looked and behold a white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he son of man.</P>
<P>This is Jesus Christ: And</P>
<P>Having on his head a golden crown,</P>
<P>Is to set him forth in his kingly power: And</P>
<P>Having a sharp sickle in his hand,</P>
<P>Is to shew he was prepared to reap; Luk. 21.27. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and great glory.</HI> This place of scripture, with ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y other like places, hath no relation to the great &amp; last day of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gment, but hath relation to great times of judgments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers are come to be ripe in sio, and the Lord Je∣sus ariseth to plead the cause of his suffering saints, after his great patience hath been exercised towards their perse∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utors; and at such a time as this he is coming to plead their cause, and to execute judgment upon their enemies; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for instance, the Apostle Peter speaks of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch a time as this prophetically, 2 Pet. 2.1. <HI>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you,</HI> &amp;c. Verse 3. <HI>And thro' covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandize of you, whose judg∣ment now of a long time lingereth not,</HI> &amp;c. shewing in his following words, how God spared not the old world, but saved Noah, and turned the cities of Sodom and Go∣morrha into ashes, and delivered just Lot: And by this president he goes on to shew, the Lord knoweth how to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eliver the godly, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished; that is, as the old world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as punished, and likewise Sodom.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 15. And another Angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eap; for the time is come for thee to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="002172_0079_0FBC7A8CF6E9A9B8"/>
By the temple we are to understand the Church. And his crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, to thrust in his sickle and reap, for saith he, the time is come for thee to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe: This was a prevailing cry, that came from the Angel that came out of the Temple or Church to the Lord Jesus Christ, to execute this judgment on the behalf of his suffering saints, seeing the time of judgement was now come.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 16. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his fickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</P>
<P>The next will be the vintage that will follow.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 17. And another Angel came out of the temple, which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</P>
<P>This angel is said to come out of the temple, which is in heaven. This alludeth from the inner Court, which is called the holiest of all, which was the place of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> habitation between the Cherubims, where the high Priest was only to enter, so that this denotes to us, that this Angel was Jesus Christ also, and his sharp sickle is to gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, as will ap∣pear in the following verse; for the Angel that came out of the temple, doth shew that the first sickle wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to reap the earth, and the angel that came out from the altar, doth shew that the other was a sharp sickle to gather the clusters of the vine of the earth.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 18. And another Angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire, and cry∣ed to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.</P>
<P>His coming out of the altar may denote that he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one that did minister about the altar, and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> altar was the same altar spoken of in Chap. 6.9, 10. <HI>I sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

And whereas it is said, he had power over fire, that is, the fire of the altar where he ministred, which represented God's wrath. It might be so said in respect of his prevailing intercession, so that God's fiery indignati∣on was executed on them, under the denomination of his thrusting in his sickle into the earth, and gathering the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vine of the earth, and casting it into the great wine press of the wrath of God; as also in the former part of this book, the execution of God's wrath is held forth by the Angels filling the censer with fire from the altar, as is to be seen Chap 8.5. <HI>And the Angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast it into the earth.</HI> The casting this fire into the earth, doth denote the execution of Gods judgments as well as reaping the earth, and gather∣ing the clusters of the vine of the earth.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 19, 20. And the Angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.</P>
<P>And the wine press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine press even to the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</P>
<P>And whereas it is said, <HI>And the angel thrust in his sickle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth,</HI> is to shew the execution of God's judgments upon the inhabitants of the earth, by cutting them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, they being ripe in sin: And casting it
<PB N="156" REF="002172_0080_0FBC7A8E78085C40"/>into the great wine press of the wrath of God, is to set forth the execution of his fiery indignation upon them. <HI>And the wine press was trodden without the city,</HI> saith the Apostle. Thus the Spirit of God makes use of these simi∣litudes; for they were wont to tread the wine press with∣out the city, and this agrees with the destruction of the Canaanites whose great overthrow was without their cities: And also when the nations gathered themselves against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣hoshaphat, their great overthrow was without their cities: And the prophet Joel alludes from the destruction of these heathen, to set forth a great day of destruction that was to come upon the enemies of God's Church, Joel 3.12. <HI>Let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, for there will I sit to judge the heathen round about.</HI></P>
<P>This valley of Jehoshaphat was the place where Jehosha∣phat and Judah assembled to bless the Lord, for their great deliverance by the destruction of their enemies, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20.26. And this prophet Joel in the next verse expresseth this destruction upon the heathen, which he prophetically fortells of, after the same manner as is spoken of in this Chapter of the Revelations. Verse 13. <HI>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; come get ye down, for the press is full, the fats overflow, for their wickedness is great.</HI></P>

And whereas it is said, <HI>great and marvellous,</HI> it is shewed wherein it was great and marvellous in the following words, to wit, <HI>seven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gels having the seven last plagues, for in their is filled up the wrath of God.</HI> In Chap. 8.2. it is said, <HI>And I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the seven angels which stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.</HI> These seven angels which founded the seven trumpets of God, was to give notice of what was to follow, as hath already been shewed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part of this book; and they were the ministers that were in the time of the primitive Church, that by the found of the trumpet it was foretold what was to come to pass; but these seven Angels which hath the seven vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ols of the seven last plagues, are the ministers of the Church after she cometh out of her wilderness state, and standeth on mount Sion with the Lamb; and the number seven measures all the faithful ministers, and the work of these ministers is to pour out the wrath of God against the false Church&amp;false ministers, and against the power that stands up to defend &amp; maintain the said false Church and ministers by this means to persecute the true Church, and this perse∣cuting power is called the power of the beast, received from the dragon, which is the devil. And these seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Angels denounce all God's Judgments to the utter ruinatr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion and destruction of the false Church, as Moses and As∣ron did upon the Egyptians; and therefore these plague<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> denounced by these seven Angels are said to be the seven last plagues, for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And I saw as it were a sea of glas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</P>
<P>This sea of glass is to shew the place of the standing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God's Church, after they come out of their wilderness start<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="159" REF="002172_0081_0FBC7A8FF5EAE310"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o snow that they stand where they have a fair prospect to behold God fitting on his throne of majesty, over all powers and dominions whatsoever: This standing is on the spiritual mount Sion, where the spiritual city of the spiri∣tual David is, or in the street of the spiritual Jerusalem, where the throne of God is, and the lamb is, Chap. 21.21. <HI>And the street of the city was pure gold, as if it were transparent glass.</HI> Compare this with Chap. 4.6. <HI>And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal.</HI> And this throne which this sea of glass was before, was in the spiritual mount Sion, where the throne of the spi∣ritual David sits, and them that had gotten the victiory over the beast. This is to be understood over the persecu∣ting powers of this world, and over his image. By this image we are to understand that form of Godliness which is set up by this persecuting power; and over his mark, which imports that we bear no such Character as his worshipers do; but are of the number that comes under this following blessing of Christ's, Mat. 5.11, 12. <HI>Blessed are ye when men shall revils you and persecute you, &amp; shall say all man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of evil against you falsely for my sake, rejoyce &amp; be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</HI> These here spoken of which Christ blesseth, hath not the mark of the beast; for all men speak well of them, saith Christ, <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.26.

Thus John saw those that had gotten the victory over all false worship set up by humane invention, stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God. This is to shew their joy and victory over all that power that sets up false wor∣ship, which is set up by the dragon and the beast, that is, by the devil and men, which is not of God, but set up by him that deceiveth the whole world.</P>

<P>These four beasts do represent the holy Angels, and are mentioned in Chap. 4.6, 7. <HI>And round about the throne were four beasts.</HI> They are said to be round about the throne, because they are compared to the four winds, or spirits of the heavens; Zech. 6.5. <HI>And the Angel answered and said unto me, these are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</HI></P>
<P>And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven Angels, seven golden vials full of the wrath of God. Thus this beast delivers the vials into the hands of the seven Angels; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the seven vials are said to be full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever; this is to set forth the execution of the wrath of God Almighty, by pouring out a full cup of his wrath upon false worshippers, or the false church, who hath a golden cup in her hand, full of abomi∣nations
<PB N="164" REF="002172_0084_0FBC7A98638CB540"/>and filthiness of her fornication; but now seven golden cups full of the wrath of God, is to be poured out upon her, in which is the wrath and indignation of God Almighty. After this manner God was wont of old to threaten his Judgments, as may be seen, Jer. 25.15. <HI>Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the na∣tions to whom I send thee to drink it,</HI> Psal. 75.8.

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 8. And the temple was filled with smoke, from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of these se∣ven Angels were fulfilled.</P>
<P>This seems to be an evident allusion from what follow∣ed the setting up of the tabernacle and temple, which were patterns of heavenly things; Exod. 40.34, 35. <HI>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle, and Moses was not able to enter into the tens of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.</HI> 1 King. 8.10, 11. <HI>And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not stand to minister, be∣cause of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.</HI> Now that seems to be an evident allusi∣on from this vision, that appeared in the figurative taber∣nacle or temple, for the smoke or cloud is the same; for it ariseth from the burning incense, as may be seen, Lev 16.13. <HI>And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat, that is, upon the the testimony;</HI> and this testimony was the ten commandments written on stone.</P>
<P>The temple being thus filled with smoke from the glo∣ry of God, and from his power, was a token of God's merciful presence with his Church; as appears in the figure here above mentioned; for it is said at the dedication of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> temple which Solomon built, when the priests were come out of the holy place, the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of

<P>From hence we may observe, that the Apostle John had the true temple of the tabernacle of the testimony set before him, by the figures that was under the first testament; for Gods Church is the true temple of the tabernacle of testi∣mony, figured by those patterns made by Moses and Solo∣mons order, by the directions they had from God; and upon the rising up of the true Church, after so long a time

Now faith John in this verse, <HI>And I heard a great voice out of the temple.</HI> This voice therefore must needs be the voice of God, seeing no man was able to enter in: And the voice was a command, saying to the seven Angels, go your way, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth.</P>

By the earth and sea in this book is intended the chil∣dren of this world, who are the worshipers of the beast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his image, and the effect of this vial of God's wrath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s as followeth.</P>

<P>It may be needful in the going over the pouring out of these seven last vials, which tends to the utter over∣throw of all false worship, set up by humane invention, under the name of worshipping the beast and his image, to shew after what manner there is a Concurrence in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounding of the seven trumpets, and the execution of the seven vials. But we are to consider, that the Angels that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded the trumpets, were the ministers of the primitive Churches; and these that pour out the vials, are the mini∣sters of the Churches that were separated from mystical Babylon, the mother of harlots, or from some of her daughters since, and for this separation have suffered perse∣cution from those Judges which have committed forni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, either with the mother, or with some of her daughters; for both mother and daughters bears one and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he same name, to wit, mystery Babylon; for both mother and daughters are one body, and one spirit, and differ only in their outward form of Godliness: And so doth the true Church, both mother and daughters bear one and the same

And the pouring forth of this vial of God's wrath is upon the Antichristian Churches, being poured out upon the earth, as the other was cast upon the earth; and the reason why the word <HI>cast upon the earth</HI> is used in the sounding of the trumpets, is because those Judgments was represented by filling the censer with fire of the altar, and casting it into the earth; as is to be seen, <HI>Chap.</HI> 8.5. And the reason why the word <HI>pouring out</HI> is used in the execution of the seven last vials, is because the execution of those judgments was represented, by pouring out a full cup, or vial of God's wrath, upon the enemies of his Church. <HI>Chap.</HI> 15.7. compared with <HI>Chap.</HI> 16.1.</P>

<P>This Angel pouring out his vial upon the seat of the beast, is to be understood upon the seat or place of Judg∣ment, where the Antichristian power sits to judge, whick power is derived from the dragon, spoken of in chap. 13.2. <HI>And, he dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great au∣thority,</HI> and saith the text his kingdome was full of darkness, this is to be understood, that kingly power derived from the dragon, from whence all persecution ariseth, or any Judgments by a secular power, about religious matters, which belongs only to Christ and his church to judge of. This vial of God's wrath being poured out upon the seat or kingdom of antichrist, did discover to them to their great shame and confusion; how they had usurped a power to judge in religious matters, which did belong only to Christ, &amp; his Church, and not to them, for their lawful power from God impowered them only to be ministers of the law for these things are wont to be hid from the wise and prudent &amp;c. Mat. 11.25. For the kingdom of the dragon is full of darkness, and it cannot judge in religious and spiritual mat∣ters.

<P>By this vision of three unclean spirits coming out of the mouth of the dragon, that is, out of the mouth of the devil; and out of the mouth of the beast, that is, out of the mouth of the anticristian power, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, that is, out of the mouth of all false prophets.

<P>And there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake and so great.</P>
<P>This is to set forth the great fear and trembling that these Judgments put the inhabitants of the earth into, so that the like had not been since men were upon the earth. That is since those men that saw it were upon the earth, for at the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans there was such great tribulation, as never was before, since the world began to that time, no nor never will be, for it followed the sheding of the blood of the son of God. Mat. 24.21.

<P>Upon the execution of these Judgments, the great city comes to be divided into three parts. And a city divided against it self cannot stand. And the cities of the nations that were stirred up by the spirits of Devils, to engage in this war against the Lamb, and against his army fell.

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 21. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent.</P>
<P>This is to set forth the greatness and terribleness of God's Judgments, inflicted or executed upon them, by this great hail, even as God did of old upon the Canaanites, Josh. 10.11. <HI>And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the Lord cast down great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from heaven upon them, unto Azekah, and they di∣ed, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which died with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il stones, then they which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Israel slew with the sword.</HI></P>

<P>This shews that these Judgments did not reform them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' it did destroy them.</P>
<P>What the seventh trumpet sounded was the finishing of prophecy, which extended to the end of this world, Chap. 11.5. <HI>And the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>The pouring out of these seven vials, is in the time of the sixth trumpet.</P>
<P>And as to the pouring out the seven last vials of God's wrath, they do extend to the utter destruction of the beast and the false prophet, and to the binding of satan and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utting him up in the bottomless pit; and therefore what we shall further read in this book of the beast and of the false prophet, and mystery Babylon, relating to their de∣struction, is the effects of this execution done upon them, by the pouring out of the seven last vials of God's wrath; for then God made mystery Babylon the great drink the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath, to her utter overthrow.</P>

This was one of the seven Angels which we read of in the foregoing Chapter, which poured out the seven last vi∣als of God's wrath, which came to John and talked with him, saying, Come hither: As much as if he should say, Come, go along with me, I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore; by this judgment is intended her condem∣nation and destruction, and by the great Whore is intended the false Church which is not Christ's Spouse but a harlot, &amp; by her</P>

<P>Thus as the true Church is reviled, reproached, and persecuted by the world, so the false Church is spoken well of, and supported, and upheld by the world; and thus they have the glory and praise of the world, ac∣cording to what is written in 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 4. and the first verse; compared with the 5th and 6th verses. <HI>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, be∣cause many false prophets are gone out into the world; they are of the world therefore speak they of the world, and the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eareth them.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In the first verse of the foregoing Chapter, we have an account, that one of the seven Angels which had the seven viols, came to John and talked with him, saying unto him, Come hither, I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great Whore. But we are to note, that her Judgment is not shewed to John, till we come to view this Eigh∣teenth Chapter, which sets forth her judgment under the denomination of the destruction of a great city, in a most fearful and dreadful man∣ner; for this Eighteenth Chapter gives us a relation, after what manner John saw her Judg∣ment in the vision which he saw concerning her destruction.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>Verse 1.</P>
<P>ANd after these things.</P>
<P>These are the things spoken of in the foregoing Chap∣ter.</P>
<P>I saw another Angel.</P>
<P>This is another Angel, and not that Angel which shew∣ed the things contained in the foregoing Chapter.</P>
<P>Come down from heaven (<HI>saith he.</HI>)</P>
<P>This gives us an account from whence this Ange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="002172_0101_0FBC7ABC4D686368"/>
Having great power.</P>
<P>This shews us, that his great power was from hea∣ven.</P>
<P>And the earth was lightened with his glo∣ry.</P>
<P>This shews that he was an Angel of light, and that the inhabitants of the earth were enlightened with his glorious light.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And he cryed mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul Spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</P>
<P>We may observe, that the foregoing verse, sheweth that a glorious Angel of light came down from heaven with great power; and that the earth was lightned with his gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and this verse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>forms us, that he made a mighty Proclamation with a strong voice, of the fall of mystical Babylon, and that this glorious light which did lighten the earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow discovers or makes manifest that this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stery Babylon the great, that was so arrayed outwardly in purple and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> colour, and decked with gold and preciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stone, and pearls. Now by the light of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Angel she appears inwardly to be the habitation of devils, and the hold of every unclean spirit, and to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age of every unclean and hateful bird.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 3. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; and the Kings of the earth have commited fornicati∣on with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</P>
<P>This verse gives us the reason of her destruction.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, come out of her my people,
<PB N="199" REF="002172_0101_0FBC7ABC4D686368"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at ye be not partakers of her sins, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e receive not of her plagues.</P>
<P>This verse gives us an account of God's call to his people to come out of her, and not to partake of her sins, that thereby they may not receive of her plagues. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like the Angels call to Lot, that he might not perish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the city of Sodom; for this city is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or like the call of Israel out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for this city is spiritually called Egypt, and where also our Lord was crucified; for this city is Sodom-like for uncleanness, and Egypt like for oppression, and like the persecuting Jews (who crucified our Lord) for persecution. There are the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that God's people are here exhorted not to partake with her, lest they partake with her in her plagues.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her ini∣quities.</P>
<P>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse expresseth the greatness of her sins, and how God remembreth her iniquities, that is, her injustice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vant of equity.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. Reward her even as she reward∣ed you.</P>
<P>This is spoken as if it were in the hands of God's people, to reward her for her iniquities, who had so great∣ly oppressed them.</P>
<P>And double unto her double, according to her works, in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double.</P>
<P>This is spoken of the cup of her fury of injustice and oppression, which she filled and made the saints to drink of; but now that they shall fill the cup double to her, that is, give her a double reward.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7. How much she hath glorified her∣self, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="002172_0102_0FBC7ABF4B6C9750"/>
This shews that her glory wherewith she glorifyed her∣self is now remembred, and sorrow is given in the room thereof, and in the room of her living deliciously, tor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment is her portion.</P>
<P>For she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</P>
<P>Thus in her prosperity she glorifyed her self like a queen, and was not in sorrow like a widow, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did not think of her coming to see sorrow.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 8. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day.</P>
<P>Thus it happeneth to her, that when she cries pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon her;</P>
<P>Death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 9. And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication, and lived delici∣ously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning.</P>
<P>This verse sets forth the lamentation of the kings of the earth, who were guilty of committing whordom, and living deliciously with her, shewing how they shall be∣wail and lament her.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 10. Standing afar off, for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city; for in one hour is thy judgment come.</P>
<P>This verse sets forth the fearfulness and suddenness of her destruction; so that the kings of the earth stood afar off for fear of her torment, saying, for in one hour is her judgment come.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 11. And the merchants of the earth shall weep, and mourn over her; for no man buyeth her merchandize any more.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="002172_0102_0FBC7ABF4B6C9750"/>
As in the foregoing verses, it is said, the kings of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th did bewail and lament for her; so in this verse it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said, the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er her. By the kings of the earth, and merchants of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e earth is intended earthly men, that glorifyed them∣selves, and lived deliciously with her. Thus her mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hants bewail the loss of their profits, which they had by her, set forth by the similitude of temporal merchan∣dizing.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 12. The merchandise of gold and sil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and precious stones, and of pearls, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne linen, and purple; and silk, and scarlet, and all thyne wood, and all manner vessels of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory, and all manner vessels of most precious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, and of brass, and iron, and marble.</P>

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 14. And the fruits that thy soul lust∣ed after, are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly, are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</P>
<P>These three verses, treateth on the ware of their mer∣chandise, to set forth their Spiritual Merchandizing by temporal similitudes, for as the woman contains a my∣stery, as appeareth in the foregoing chapter and seventh verse, so doth this city, and the merchandizing here spo∣ken of; for the woman and city is one, as appears in the foregoing Chapter and last verse. <HI>And the woman which thou sawest, is that great city, which reigneth over the Kings of the earth.</HI> And this city hath a spiritual name, Chap. 11.8. <HI>Which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord also was crucified.</HI> And the woman and the city
<PB N="202" REF="002172_0103_0FBC7AC0B821DF80"/>is called great Babylon. Thus the false Church is set forth by the same similitude that the true Church is only the true Church is set forth by a woman, that is a wife, living in wedlock. But the false Church is set forth by a woman, that is a harlot, living in fornicati∣on. The true Church is called the holy city but the false Church by a city of uncleanness; the one to be the <HI>city of God,</HI> where his throne is, the other to be the ha∣bitation <HI>of Devils, and the hold of every foul spirit,</HI> so that the inhabitants of this great city, comprehends t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole body of sin.

<P>By his sitting on the white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orse, is to shew that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is both a judge and a warrior, Judg. 5.10. <HI>Speak ye the ride on white Asses, ye that sit in Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>And in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</P>
<P>John doth give us an an account that in this heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ly vision he say a white horse, and he that sat u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on him was called faithful and true; and that in rig∣teousness he doth judge and make war. Here is tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things to be observed;</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="002172_0108_0FBC7ACAD27A6C48"/>
The first is, He that sat upon the white horse is called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithful and true; this shews us that he is faithful and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue.</P>
<P>And secondly, That in righteousness he doth judge and make war; this sheweth us that he is both a judge and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> warrior, and that he judgeth in righteousness, and hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st grounds to make war.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 12. His eyes were as a flame of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire.</P>
<P>This is to set forth his majestical looks, and piercing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, terrible to behold.</P>
<P>And on his head were many crowns.</P>
<P>This sheweth that he is <HI>King of kings, and Lord of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds,</HI> as in the 16th verse.</P>
<P>And had a name written, that no man knew but he himself.</P>
<P>This written name of his, is a secret mysterious name, that is known to no man but he himself, whose name is written in the following verse.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 13. And he was cloathed with a vesture dipt it blood.</P>
<P>This is to represent to us his victorious acts, as if his resture were dipp'd in the blood of his enemies.</P>
<P>And his name is called the word of God.</P>
<P>This is the written name that no man knows but he himself; for it is the name of the Son of God in his di∣vine nature, even that word which made the world, and after was made flesh, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.14. <HI>And yet the world knew him not,</HI> Joh. 1.10. Yea, it is the invisible God, <HI>which no man hath seen at any time,</HI> Joh 1.38.1 Tim. 6.16. <HI>Whom no man hath seen, nor can see, but to whom the Son shall reveal him.</HI> This is the same warrior spoken of in Isai. 63.1, &amp;c. <HI>Who is this that cometh from Edom with died garments, from Bozra; this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore art thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that tread∣eth
<PB N="214" REF="002172_0109_0FBC7ACC063B0438"/>the wine fat? I have troden the wine press alone, and of the people there was none with me; for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my rayment.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was God represented to the prophet, like a war∣rior coming from Edom; that is from the slaughter of the enemies of his Church, as a victorious man of war, whose garment is stained with the blood of his enemies; for the day of vengeance is in my heart, saith the Lord, and the year of my redeemed is come. And answerable to this, it is said in the second verse of this Chapter, <HI>for true and righteous are his Judgments,</HI> for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her for∣nication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 14. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, cloath∣ed in fine linen, white and clean.</P>
<P>By heaven is intended the dwelling place of the saints; and the armies is intended the saints and servants of the Lord; and by following him is to be understood, that they followed the <HI>Word of God,</HI> that unknown name to the children of this world; and their sitting upon white horses, is to shew that they sit in judgment with the judge that rode on the white horse, and are warriors with him; and their being cloathed in fine linen, white and clean, is to set forth their righteous, holy, and sanctifyed state.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 15. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty God.</P>
<P>This sharp sword is the word of his power; for his name is called the word of God, Heb. 4.12. <HI>For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 16. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of Lords.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, as mystery Babylon the great, the mother of fornications and abominations of the earth, who ruled over the kings of the earth, who hath com∣mitted fornication with her: Her name was written on her forehead, that it might be known who she was; so this king and great warrior hath his name written on his vesture, and on his thigh, that it may be read and known who he is, to wit, king of kings, and Lord of lords, the Supream over all kings, and Lord over all lords, whose

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to∣gether, to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</P>
<P>This verse declaies who were his enemies that ingaged war against him, to wit, the beast that mystery Babylon rode upon, that great whore the false Church: And this beast was the persecuting powers of this world, that sup∣ported and upheld said false Church, but persecuted the trae. And these kings of the earth are the kings of this world, that have committed fornication with this false Church in joining in with her, being deceived by her; and these armies are the inhabitants of the earth, that are drunken with the wine of her fornication; these are they that are gathered together to make war against him whose name is called the Word of God; for these are they that worship the beast and his image, and have given a mark in their right hand or in their forehead; that is, they yielded obedience to the image, or form of worship, set up by the kingly or magistratical powers of this world. And the armies in heaven that followed the word of God, are the saints and servants of God, that will not worship the beast nor his image; that is, they are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, and worshipeth the God that made heaven and earth, in spirit and in truth; and will not observe that form of Godliness set up by the kings and judges of this world, and carried on by them under the name of worshiping God, when as it is only the commandments

<P>Thus the whole world is deceived with this form o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Godliness, or image of the beast; but they that dwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in heaven refuse to attend it, by reason of which, pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cution ariseth against them, sometimes to the loss of their lives, sometimes to imprisonment, and taking away th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> goods, with other punishments, under pretence of making disturbance and giving offence; and this it is that occasi∣oneth this war and great battel.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 20.

<P>The foregoing verse sheweth that the battel was set in array by him that sat on the horse, whose name is called the Word of God, with his heavenly army And the beast, &amp; the kings of the earth also, set the battle in array, with their armys, being the inhabitants of the earth, and this verse giveth us an account, that the beast was taken, that is in a snare, and with him the false prophet, that wrought miracles before him, with which he decei∣veth them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his Image, and also that both the beast and the false prophet were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone: By the beast is intend∣ed the persecuting powers of this world, or those that support the whore or ralse church, who received their power to persecute from the dragon, and by their armies is intended those that stood on his side, to assist him in this battle, to wit the kings of the earth, with their armies, these were they that stood to assist the beast, or the persecuting powers, against him that sat on the

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1.</P>
<P>And I saw an Angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess pit, and a great chain in his hand.</P>
<P>In the latter part of the foregoing Chapter, we had an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount of the utter overthrow of Antichrist, and all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erents; and now are entering upon an account that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en us concerning the dragon that old serpent which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e devil and satan.</P>
<P>And I saw an Angel come down from hea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, (<HI>saith he.</HI>)</P>
<P>An Angel is a messenger, and heaven is God's throne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. 66.1. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, the heaven is my throne.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us it appears, that this messenger or Angel came from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e throne of God, having the key of the bottomless pit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a great chain in his hand. The next verse will shew
<PB N="224" REF="002172_0114_0FBC7AD7342E7D70"/>us the use of the great chain, and after the use of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> key, and the bottomless pit.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. And he laid hold on the drago<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that old serpent, which is the devil and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tan, and bound him a thousand years.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that the chain was to chain up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> devil for a limited time; and he is described to be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> old serpent, because he beguiled Eve, and so gave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first parents a mortal wound, they being stung by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that had the power of death.</P>

<P>Thus we see the key was to lock him up in the bottomle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pit: And as to this bottomless pit, we have an account of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Chap. 9.1.2. <HI>And I saw a star fall from heaven unto the eart and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit, &amp; he opene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> darkened by reason of the smoke.</HI> This star falling fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heaven to the earth, doth set forth the apostatizing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the true Church, who fell from her heavenly station <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an earthly and carnal state. And to this star that fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from heaven to the earth, was given the key of the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tomless pit; for this falling star was a fit instrument fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the devil to open this bottomless pit of heresie and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lusion, to deceive the whole world; so that the smok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that arose out of it, darkened the sun and the air. By th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sun and the air being darkened by the smoke that rose ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the bottomless pit, is to signify, that by reason of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> apostacy, the glorious light of the Gospel, which befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did shine gloriously, was now quite darkened, and ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> christ arose or came out of the smoke like locusts, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was the beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And the beast with two horns like a lamb that rose ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the earth, did represent the false prophets, and antichrist getting head and power.</P>

<HI>And set a seal upon him.</HI> Thus was his thousand years sentence sealed, speaking after the manner of men, <HI>Dan.</HI> 6.7. <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.66.</P>
<P>That he should deceive the nations no more.</P>
<P>That is, in the time of this thousand years of the saints <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igning with Christ, as he had before done by open∣ing this bottomless pit of heresie and delusion, by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had deceived the nations, till now he himself is shut up in it a prisoner from deceiving the nations, where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust be kept,</P>
<P>Till the thousand years be fulfilled, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter that he must be loosed for a little sea∣son.</P>
<P>As in the seventh, eighth, and ninth verses of this Chap∣ter, <HI>And shall go out to deceive the nations,</HI> &amp;c. But it will be by another kind of stratagem.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.</P>
<P>John here declares three things which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saw in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifion. The first is, he saw <HI>thrones;</HI> and secondly saith he, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d they sat on them,</HI> not declaring who they were that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t on them; neither could he till the vision had made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> known to him who they were; and thirdly, <HI>Judgment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given unto them,</HI> saith he, for judgment belongs to them that sit upon thrones.</P>
<P>And I saw the souls of them that were be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had re∣ceived his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands.</P>
<P>This is a plain description that they were the saints <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d servants of God, that were be headed for the wit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of Jesus, and for the word of God, and his faithful Church, in that they had not worshiped the beast, neither
<PB N="226" REF="002172_0115_0FBC7ADBCFB6C808"/>his image, neither had received his mark upon their fore∣heads, or in their hands. And a second thing is,</P>
<P>And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</P>
<P>So that it appears it was the Church of Christ, that sat upon them thrones; and that now judgment was gi∣ven unto them. And this thousand years reign with Christ is the thousand years that the devil is chain'd and lock't up in the bottomless pit a prisoner; and this thousand years begins when the beast or the antichristian powers and the false prophet, which represents all false prophets) are said to be taken, that is in a snare, and cast alive in∣to a lake of fire, burning with brimstone, and all their adherents slain with the sword of him that sat upon the white horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth whose name is called the <HI>Word of God,</HI> as in the two last verses of the foregoing Chapter: And the very next thing in the first second and third verses of this Chapter, is shewed the chaining up of the devil in the bottomless pit. This is the time of this thousand years of the Churches reigning with Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 5. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years are finished. This is the first resurrection.</P>
<P>By the rest of the dead is intended, those that were bodi∣ly dead shall not live again until the thousand years be finished; for it will be after these thousand years that the resurrection of the body will be; and the truth of this will appear towards the end of this Chapter: This is the first resurrection saith the Apostle; this first resurrection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is interested in but only the Church of Christ, for saith the Apostle, but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished; which imports it is such a resurrection, that only those that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast neither his image, neither had receiv'd his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands, that shall come to this happy enjoyment, to
<PB N="227" REF="002172_0115_0FBC7ADBCFB6C808"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive and reign with Christ in the time of this thousand years; and that the rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years shall be finished; and it is called the first resurrection, in respect that the saints are partakers of a twofold resurrection, that is to say, a resurrection out of a state of sin, into a state of holiness; and this is a re∣surrection that goes before the resurrection of the body, spoken of by our saviour, Joh. 5.25. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God, and they that hear shall live.</HI> Eph. 2. comparing the first verse with the sixth, <HI>And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins. And hath raised us up together, and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</HI> This is the first resur∣rection, which all saints have a part in. But this pro∣phecy hath relation to a time of a general resurrection of the Church of Christ, after a long time of their death and sorrow; and of their flourishing state that shall follow for the space of a thousand years in this world. As to their death, it may be thus considered: The Church of Sardis did so decay and dye from that spiritual life that they were once in, that <HI>they had a name to live when in truth they were dead,</HI> Chap. 3.1. And after this we read of a star that fell from heaven, which the third trumpet gave notice of, and it fell upon the third part of the ri∣vers, and upon the fountains of waters, and so imbittered them, that many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter; this was by drinking in corrupt doctrine, which this falling star brought into the Church, by rea∣son of which many in the Church decayed and dyed from that spiritual life which before they lived in, when they were nourished with living fountains of water, which was good and wholesom doctrine. Thus death and darkness came upon the Church, and great miseries and afflictions fol∣lowed; so that she came to be troden under foot, and pro∣phesied a long time cloathed in sackloth; and their dead bodys was seen to lye in the street of the great city, which was spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, and where also our Lord was crucifyed; and her enemies did rejoyce
<PB N="228" REF="002172_0116_0FBC7ADD513B58B0"/>over her, and did overcome her, and did kill her: This was her death. But we are now come to such a time and age of the world, that all her enemies are now subdued, and the day of her rising, living, and reigning with Christ is come, and will continue a long time, that is for the space of a thousand years. The prophet Ezekiel did prophesie of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very resurrection of the church under the type of the Jews captivity in Babilon, and their return into their own land, Ezek. 37. comparing the fore part of the chapter with the 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>So I pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣phesiea as he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great army, then he said unto me, Son of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these bones are the whole house of Israel, behold they say our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, we are cut off for our part, prophesy therefore &amp; say unto them, thus saith the Lord God, behold O my people I will open your graves, &amp; cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel, and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my peo∣ple, and brought you up out of your graves, and shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your land.</HI> This propnesie speaks of the churches coming out of her captivity, oppressions, and sorrows, and of this first and general resurrection, into this happy and holy state which John here saw in his vision.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. Blessed and holy is he, that hath part in the first resurrection.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere is two things to be noted, the first is, they are in a blessed state of holiness that have part in the first re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and therefore</P>
<P>On such the second death hath no power.</P>
<P>Herein their blessedness consists, in respect that the <HI>second death hath no power.</HI> And they cannot have part in the first resurrection, till they are delivered, and risen out of a state of sin, and are come into a state of holiness and all this must be on this side the grave, for the second death is inflicted after the resurrection of the body, as may be seen in the 13 and 14 verses of this chapter.</P>

<P>Thus it appears that the devil is no sooner let loose, but is immediately in mischief, contriving to destroy the church of God, by deceiving the nations that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the four quarters of the earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stirring them up to bat∣tle, against the church of God, which did happen to their utter destruction,.

<P>This <HI>He</HI> that saith to John, <HI>Behold I make all things ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is he that John spake of in the 11th verse of the foregoing Chapter, saying, <HI>And I saw a great white throue, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> away:</HI> That is, this visible heaven and earth that is now in being.

<P>This is a confirmation of the truth of God's purpose concerning these things, as if they were already done; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th John, he saith unto me it is done; that is, God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t sat upon the throne said so; and further saith, I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pha and Omega,</P>
<P>The Beginning and the end.</P>
<P>Thus God signifieth to John, that he is both first and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, so that none can hinder or stop God's purpose con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing these things, relating to the saints ever∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing inheritance, according to Pauls testimony, Eph. 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>In him also we have obtained an inheritance, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>destinated according to the purpose of him, who worketh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> things after the counsel of his own will.</HI> This working <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> things after the counsel of his won will, relates to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese things in particular, concerning his own works, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dates to nothing acted or done by the creature.</P>
<P>I will give unto him that is athirst, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untain of the water of life freely.</P>

<P>That is, my heir; for the son is the fathers heir.

<P>As in the foregoing verse God makes gracious promise to those that overcome, that they shall inherit all the happy things before promised, so on the contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this verse he threatens the fearful (that is the guilty and unbelievers, and the abominable, and murderers, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they shall have their part in the lake which burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with fire and brimstone, which is the second death; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this second death is an eternal Judgment.

<P>From hence we may observe, that this Angel was o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the seven Angels which had the seven vials full of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seven last plagues.

So in like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anner one of the seven Angels that had the seven vials <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to John and shewed him the pomp and glory that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat whore the false Church was in, and withal shewed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m her utter destruction and overthrow. And his coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> John was in like manner as this Angel doth, as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be seen Chap. 17.1, &amp;c. <HI>There came one of the seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gels, which had the seven vials, and talked with me, say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Come hither, I will shew unto thee the Judgment of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat whore,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>So he carried me away in the spirit into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wilderness,</HI> &amp;c. But into a great and high mountain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew him the true Church, as in the next verse ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reth.</P>

<P>In the like manner did the Angel to John, in shewing him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> false Church, as may be seen Chap. 17.3. <HI>So he carried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> away in the spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, having seven heads and ten horns.</HI> From hence we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serve, that the Angel carried John to a great and high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untain to shew him the true Church: This mountain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the mountain of God's strength, that this city stands upon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ saith, <HI>A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at. 5.14. And secondly, we may observe that the Angel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> John into the wilderness to see the false Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> saw her sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m hence we may observe, that the false Church is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilderness; that is, she is in a bewildered state. Secondly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saw her sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast: The scar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coloured beast is the persecuting powers of this world, which supports and upholds her. And we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, that John saw the true Church, descending from God

The true Church is compared to a great city un∣der the name of new <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which name is derive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Jerusalem the city of David, so the false church is also compare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to a great city under the name of great Babilon, which name isderiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from old Babylon, the oppressor of God's Church, Chap. 17.18, compared with Chap. 18.21. <HI>And the woman whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the earth.

<P>And the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</P>
<P>Which imports not drossy, but pure gold. This is to set forth the purity, glory and splendor of God's Church or

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, every several gate was of one pearl.</P>
<P>These gates or pearls were the twelve elders of the tribes of Israel, every one of them set forth by a several pearl.</P>
<P>And the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</P>
<P>This is to set forth how glorious the Church or city of God is within, (<HI>Psal.</HI> 45.13.) where God's throne is, and the throne of the Lamb, before whose throne there is a sea of glass, as may be seen Chap. 4.6. <HI>And before the throne, there is a sea of glass, like unto christal.</HI> And upon the destruction of that great city called mystery Babylon, and the repairing of this holy city, which was <HI>troden under foot,</HI> as appears Chap. 11.2. <HI>These that had gotten the victo∣ry over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,</HI> John <HI>saw standing on this sea of glass, having the harps of God, and singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 22. And I saw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty, and the lamb are the temple of it.</P>
<P>Thus the Church hath its dwelling in God, for God and the lamb are the temple of it. Thus God's people dwell in God, and God in them: They are the city of God, so that God dwelleth in them; and God Almighty and the lamb is their temple; so that their dwelling is also in God, ac∣cording to Christ's word's, Joh. 14.20. <HI>At that day ye shall know, that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you.</HI> This is the blessed union that is between Christ and his Church, God in his people.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 23. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of the Lord did lighten it, and the lamb is the light thereof.</P>
<P>This verse doth set forth that excellent light that the Church of Christ enjoys, and is in, when she is in a state of purity and holiness; for then she lives in the enjoyment of that light, which doth so much excel the light of the sun and moon, so as that they are spoken of as altogether use∣less. After this manner doth the prophet Isaiah set forth the glorious light of the Lord so much to excel the light of the sun and moon, as to shame and confound them, when he shines forth in his Church, Isai. 24.23. <HI>Then the noon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.</HI> This is the Jerusalem, the city which this prophet speaks of, alluding from the figure, Isai. 60.1, 2, 3. compared with the 19th and 20th verses. <HI>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee; for behold darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee; and the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising; the sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon
<PB N="248" REF="002172_0126_0FBC7AEFF5B11630"/>give light unto thee, but the Lord shall be unto thee an ever∣lasting light, and thy God thy glory; the sun shall no more go down, neither thy moon withdraw it self, for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light.</HI> All these Scriptures are to set forth the great glory of the Church, when she shall arise in <HI>the beauty of holiness,</HI> then will the Lord arise and shine upon her, far more excellently than all the bright lights of heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 24. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it, and the kings of the earth do bring their glory &amp; honour into it.</P>
<P>This verse sheweth how that through the glorious state of the church shining so excellently, by reason of her vertues, beauty, and holiness, so that the nations which are saved shall walk in the light of this city, and her glory shall be so seen that the kings of the earth shall set so light by their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nour and glory that this world doth afford them, that they shall bring it into this city, esteeming the honour and glo∣ry of it so far to excell the fading and perishing honour and glory of this world, so that they shall bring their glo∣ry and honour to this city.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 25. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day, for there shall be no night there.</P>
<P>By the gates not being shut at all by day there being no night there, is to shew that the gates stand open continually; as a token of God's rich mercy and grace, as if he stood with open arms to embrace, and to receive all into this holy city, that will come, out of their sins, and come into a state of holiness, that thereby they may have free enterance into his love and favour.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 26. And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</P>
<P>This is to set forth the excellent state and glory of this ci∣ty, above all the glory and honour of this world, so that the nations of the earth shall see it, and bring their glory and honour to it, to honour it therewithall, which is to shew the unvaluable glory and honour of it, above the honour and glory of this world, which they shall set light by.</P>

<HI>Verse</HI> 27. And there shall in no wise enter into it, any thing that defileth, neither whosoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, but they which are written in the lamb's book of life.</P>
<P>Here is two things to be observed, the first is, tho' the gates of this city stand open, north south, east, and west, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>token of God's mercy and rich grace to the world, yet no∣thing is suffered to enter in, that defileth, neither whosoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie. And secondly, It must be only such as have liberty from the lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world, for they must obtain fa∣vour from the lamb of God, to have enterance in, by having their names written in his book of life; so that by the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world, they may have free enterance into this city of the living God, the great king, which city is the bride the lambs wife, which he hath purchased with his own blood, Eph. 5.26, 27. <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might sanctifie and cleanse it, with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself, a glorious church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holy and without blemish.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Verse</HI> 2. In the midst of the street of it.</P>
<P>Thus the angel shewed John this pure river of water of life which proceeded from the throne of God, and of the lamb, which is in the midst of the street of this city. From hence we may note, that God's throne is in his church, and that his pure living and quickening spirit is no where to be seen but in the midst of the street of this city, which is in his church, <HI>for if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his.</HI> Rom. 8.9.</P>
<P>And of either side of the river was there the tree of life.</P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus is this tree of life, and was first figured by the tree of life, which was in the midst of paradise, or the garden of <HI>eden.</HI> Gen. 2.9. And Christ makes a promise to him that overcometh to give him to eat of the tree of life, <HI>which is in the midst of the paradise of God,</HI> chap. 2.7. This pro∣mise alludes from this figurative tree of life, in the midst of the garden of <HI>eden,</HI> Gen. 2.9. unto Christ himself, who was figured out by it, it is the water of life that causeth this tree of life to spring up, and grow out of the earth, for as this water of life doth set forth the spirit of God, so doth the tree of life set forth the second Adam, to be a quickning spirit, the lord from heaven originally, and those that eat of the fruit of it, are quickned by it, through the life and sap of it, which is the spirit of the living God, even as the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil did yield the knowledge of good and evil to Adam, and to all his po∣sterity who are the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Antitype of it, which shews the work of the law written on their hearts, by which they shall be judged, and rewarded according to their own works, whether good or evil, so on the other hand if he had taken and eat of the tree of life, it would have afforded unto him the quickening spirit of life, <HI>to have lived for ever,</HI> Gen. 3.22, 23. but the tree of the knowledge, of the righteous law of God, ministred t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im death and condemnation, but</P>

<P>In the Antitype is Jesus Christ, and believers are branches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grafted into him by faith, who receive life and nourish∣ment from him, who is the root and stock; whose roots wants no moisture, being watered with the fulness of this pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, for he hath the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness of the spirit without measure, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.34. <HI>Coll.</HI> 1.19. And this tree beareth twelve manner of fruits, and yieldeth her fruit every month, this sets forth the excellency of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee, above all other trees, in that it not only beareth varie∣ty of fruit, but also yieldeth its fruit every month; what wonderfull invitation is here to the hungry, and to the thirsty soul, for here is a city whose street is plentifully fur∣nished with meat and with drink; whose gates stand open, north, south, east, and west, inviting the hungry and the thirsty soul, to come and to eat and drink; the inhabitants also crying and calling, and saying, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters, and he that hath no mony, come ye buy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without mony and without price; wherefore do ye spend mony for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not, hearken diligent∣ly unto me and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul de∣light it self in fatness, encline your ear and come unto me, hear and your soul shall live,</HI> Isai. 55.1. &amp;c. <HI>Jesus stood and cried saying, if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink, he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eveth on me as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters,</HI> Joh. 7.37, 38. <HI>And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</HI> Joh. 6.35. <HI>Whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</HI> Joh. 4.14. <HI>And the Spirit and the bride say come, and let him that heareth say come, and let him that is athirst come, and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely.</HI></P>
<P>Thus excellent is the tree of life, for it will afford us the bread of life; and this pure river of water of life will
<PB N="252" REF="002172_0128_0FBC7AF585C99528"/>afford us such drink, that we shall never thirst more, for those that eat of the fruit of the tree of life shall never hun∣ger; and those that drink of this pure river of water of lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which is clear as cristal) shall never thirst any more.

<P>And the leaves of the tree were for the heal∣ing of the nations,</P>
<P>Both temporally and spiritually. Thus it appears, all that this tree bears is vertuous, for it grows on either fide of the river of the water of life, so that it wants no moisture, therefore its leaves shall not wither, but be green and vertu∣ous, for the healing of the nations; for the leaves are the leaves of the tree of life, and nothing proceeding from it can wither or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, for it is altogether vertuous; so that the leaves are for the healing of the wounded soul, both tempo∣rally and spiritually, yea, the wounds of the broken hearted shall it heal, for the tree of life is Jesus Christ, and the leaves of the tree have the vertue of the tree; and whosoe∣ver toucheth but the border of his garment, with the finger of faith shall be healed. Luk. 8.43. &amp;c. <HI>A woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living on the physicians, neither could be healed of any, came behind him and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her issue of blood stanched: And Jesus saith unto her, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole.</HI> Rom. 15.4. <HI>What∣soever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we thro' patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.

<P>This is the happy state of God's church in its purity, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for they enjoy that light which doth far excell either sun <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> moon, or any other created light, for God is to them a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more excellent light, 1 Joh. 1.5, 6, 7. <HI>This then is the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sage which we have heard of him and declare unto you, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God is light, and in him is no darkness at all: if we say we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fellowship with him, and walk in darkness we lie, and do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the truth, but if we walk in the light as he is in the light, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his son cleanseth us from all sin.</HI> Joh. 8.12. <HI>Then spake Jesu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> again unto them saying, I am the light of the world, he tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> followeth me, shall not walk in darkness but shall have the ligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of life.</HI></P>

<P>This is a promîse of the duration and happiness of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 6. And he said unto me, these sayings are faithful and true.</P>
<P>This is an affirmation to confirm the faithfulness and truth of these things, for that end that they may be the better cre∣dited.</P>
<P>And the Lord God of the holy prophets, sent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his angel to shew unto his servants, the things which must shortly be done.</P>
<P>The Apostle John here restifieth to us, how that the Lord God of the holy prophets, sent his angel to shew unto his servants, the things which shortly must be done. We are to understand, it hath not relation to the accomplishing of the whole matter of this book; but to such things which were to be done, in every age, for this book of prophesie, speaks of things to be done from the time of the writing of the book of this prophesie, to the end of the world, so that there are things to be done in every generation, and these words. <HI>The things which must shortly be done,</HI> speaks to God's children in every age, that they may be watchful, and pre∣pared,
<PB N="255" REF="002172_0129_0FBC7AF6B9512C08"/>looking for the accomplishing of those things which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to be done in their age and time, and therefore may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id shortly to be done, and yet speak to God's people in every age; as for instance, Mark. 13.30. <HI>Verily I say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto you, that this generation shall not pass till all these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings be done.</HI> So that it might be said to that genera∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, these were the things shortly to be done; and so might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be intimated concerning the state of every Church in Asia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o whom this book was sent, that there were things shortly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be done that did belong to the state of every one of those Churches, and from that time to the end of the world; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings are always shortly to be done to them, that are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing a little before they are done.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 7. Behold I come quickly.</P>
<P>This is not intended Christ's coming at the great and last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay of Judgment, but his speedy coming for the help of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is elect in their distresses; as for instance, Psal. 40.1, 2. <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d my cry; he brought me up also out of an horrible pit.</HI> Thus the Lord came quickly and helped David by bringing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m out of some great difficulty that he was in. Heb. 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 38. <HI>For yet a little while and he that shall come, will come, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith; but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese to whom the author writes were at the time of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting under persecution; as appears in the foregoing verses, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his writing to them is for that end, that they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t faint under their present tribulation, encouraging them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be in the exercise of patience, as in the foregoing verse; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nifying to them, that it would be but a little while be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Lord Jesus would come to relieve them out of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent distresses. And we may see how the Lord Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reatened the Church of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phesus, that if they did not re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent he would <HI>come quickly, and remove their candlestick out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his place,</HI> Chap. 2.5. And in verse 16, he threatens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of the Church of Pargamus, that if they did not re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, he would <HI>come unto them quickly, and fight against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem with the sword of his mouth;</HI> and also threatens the Chuch of Sardis, if they did not watch, he would <HI>come on
<PB N="256" REF="002172_0130_0FBC7AF86726E748"/>them as a thief.</HI> And he promiseth the Church of Philade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Phia to <HI>come quickly,</HI> exhorting them to <HI>hold that fast whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they had,</HI> Chap. 3.11. Thus this coming quickly relates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the present time of Christ's coming, either in judgment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mercy, according to the state he finds his servants in.</P>
<P>Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prophecy of this book (<HI>saith the Apostle;</HI>)</P>
<P>For they that keep the prophecy of this book, will pa∣tiently wait for the coming of the Lord, according to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is written, Luk. 12.43. compared with verse 45, 46. <HI>Bless<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing. But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, my lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> delayeth his coming, the lord of that servant will come in a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ware, and will cut him in sunder.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 8. And I John saw these things, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heard them; and when I had heard and seen, fell down to worship before the feet of the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gel which shewed me these things.</P>
<P>Here is two things to be observed in this Verse: The fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, John's affirmation of the truth of these things, in the words, saying, And I John saw these things, and heard the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And the second is, the account that John here gives of him∣self, how that when he had heard and seen these thing he fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which shewed him these things.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 9. Then saith he unto me, See thou d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it not, for I am thy fellow servant, and of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brethren the prophets; and of them which kee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sayings of this book; worship God.</P>
<P>Here is four things to be observed in this verse: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first is, the Angels reproving of John for falling down t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worship before his feet, in these words, saying, See thou d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it not: And secondly, the reason he gives John why h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought not to do it, is given in these words, For I am (sait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he) one of thy fellow servants, and of thy brethren the pro∣phets; this is the reason he gives John, signifying to him
<PB N="257" REF="002172_0130_0FBC7AF86726E748"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at he is but his equal, that is to say his fellow servant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd one of his brethren the prophets: And the third thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be observed is, how this servant and prophet of the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives John an account that he is one of them that doth keep the sayings of this book: And fourthly, exhorts John to worship God, which doth import, he only ought to be worshiped, who is God the Creator, and not the creature.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 10. And he saith unto me, seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.</P>
<P>Here is two things to be observed from this verse: The first is, the charge that the Angel gives John (when he had made known these things to John) not to seal them, in these words, saying, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book. Thus it appears, that John was required to dis∣close these things upon his knowledge of them. And the second thing is, the reason which is given him why he should not seal them, for saith the Angel, The time is at hand. Thus it appears, that John was required forth with to make publication of them upon the consideration that the time was at hand; so that the seven churches of Asia, to whom they did concern, might be warned to prepare themselves for those things which were then at hand.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 11. He that is unjust let him be unjust still, and he which is filthy let him be filthy still, and he that is righteous let him be righteous still, and he that is holy let him be holy still.</P>
<P>By the following verse the reason will be seen why the Angel saith thus concerning the state of the unjust and un∣holy, and concerning the state of the righteous and holy.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 12. And behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man ac∣cording as his work shall be.</P>
<P>And behold I come quickly, saith the Lord. Here he gives warning of his speedy coming, to the unjust, and to the filthy, and to the righteous, and to the holy; and that he will bring his reward with him to give unto every one
<PB N="258" REF="002172_0131_0FBC7AFC20BEEF40"/>of them according as his work shall be. And thus at his coming, he will reward the unjust and unholy according as their work shall be: And to the righ∣teous and holy according to their work. This coming quickly is in judgment to the wicked, &amp; with a good reward to the righteous; so that the Lord here speaks unto the un∣just, after this manner, when I come with my reward, let him be unjust still, for the day of his grace is now past, and so let it be with the unholy, for he likewise hath outgone the day of his grace, and therefore if the unjust and the fil∣thy, will run the hazard of such an unjust and filthy state, I will come quickly upon them with my reward; and this is to forewarn the unjust and filthy of the great Hazard they stand in, while in that hazardable state. And to encourage the righteous and holy so to continue that they might not lose their reward. But to take this saying in short it carries with it implicitly, as if the Lord should say to the unjust &amp; filthy, to the righteous and holy, even to them all, Behold I come quickly to reward every one of you according to your work and as I find you, so I will reward you, and so you shall ever remain, in that state I find you in at my coming; so your reward shall be, and in that state shall you remain, that is, the unjust under the reward of the unjust, and the filthy under the reward of the filthy, and the righteous under the reward of the righteous, and the holy under the reward of the holy. And this coming quickly is such a coming as he foretold of to several of the churches of Asia, Chap. 2.5.16. <HI>Repent or else I will come unto you quickly.</HI> 25. v. <HI>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</HI> chap. 3.3. <HI>If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come on thee.</HI> chap. 3.11. <HI>Behold I come quickly, hold that fast which thou hast.</HI> Mat. 24.50, 51. <HI>The Lord of that servant shall come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in a hour that he is not ware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth</HI> Matt. 25.6. <HI>And at midnight there was a crie made, behold the. bridegroom cometh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="002172_0131_0FBC7AFC20BEEF40"/>
Thus the Lord is wont to forewarn, and to tell of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oming before he cometh, that the unjust and the filthy may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e fore-warned of the danger they are in while in that state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at they may repent before it be too late, and that the righteous and the holy may be sensible of their righteous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holy reward, by being put in mind of it, that thereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y may be encouraged to continue so in well doing, un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this sudden and quick coming of the Lord, to execute judgment on the one, and to deliver the other.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 13. I am Alpha and Omega, the be∣ginning and the end, the first and the last.</P>
<P>This is to back the foregoing verse, by shewing that there was none before him, neither shall there be any that shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome after him, to hinder him in his purpose of rewarding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth the Just and unjust according to their works.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 14. Blessed are they that do his com∣mandments, that they may have right to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee of life, and may enter in through the gates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to the city.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>this verse he pronounceth a blessing to them that do his com∣mandments, and in the next place he sheweth wherein the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essing consists, for in so doing they may have right to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee of life, and may have entrance in through the gates in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the city, for these are the just and holy, that do his com∣mandments; for it appears in the foregoing chapter and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> verse, that there shall in no wise enter into it any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t defileth, neither whosoever worketh abomination or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keth a lie.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 15. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d whoremongers, and murderers, and Idolaters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</P>
<P>From this verse we may understand, that all that are with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the holy city, are in a polluted and defiled state; and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at are within the holy city, are in a sanctifyed and holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate. From hence we may understand, that all mankind
<PB N="260" REF="002172_0132_0FBC7AFE35C08750"/>are in one of these two states; that is, either in a state o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sin, or in a state of righteousness; and that by being in the holy city, doth measure the whole Church of God, and by being without, doth measure the whole world.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 16. I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the Churches: I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</P>
<P>This verse contains the testimony of Jesus Christ to three things: His first testimony is, that he sent his Angel to testify these things in the Churches. Thus it appears that this book was sign'd to (at the end of it) by Jesus Christ himself, to confirm the truth of it. And secondly, he testify that he is both the root &amp; offspring of David: Thus he de∣clares himself to be God and Man; for if he be the roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and offspring of David, David must be a branch of of his root. And if he be the offspring of David, then of necessity David must be the root of him. Thus it appears that he is both David's Lord, and David's Son. And thirdly, he de∣clares himself to be the bright and morning Star; this re∣lates to his ministerial office, for the ministers of the seven Churches are represented in the likeness of stars; but the Lord Jesus is the most excellent and brightest star of all the ministers; and promiseth in Chap. 2.28. <HI>To him that overcometh and keepeth his works to the end, to give him the morning star;</HI> That is, he shall be the brightest star in all the Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 17. And the spirit and the bride say come, and let him that heareth say come, and let him that is athirst come, and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely.</P>
<P>This verse consisteth of most gracious invitations, both by the spirit and by the bride, who are one in union, that is Christ and his church, expresseth a full and free invitation to all to come into the holy city, to drink of the water of life, and that freely. And secondly withall bids him that
<PB N="261" REF="002172_0132_0FBC7AFE35C08750"/>heareth this invitation to invite others to come. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ly declares that it is left to the free liberty, to whosoever will come, and take of the water of life freely.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 18. For I testifie unto every man that heareth the words of the prophesy of this book, if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.</P>
<P>This verse contains a severe threatning, to every man that hears the prophesy of this book, that if any man shall add unto the things therein contained, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 19. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</P>
<P>This verse likewise contains a severe threatening against any that shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, how that God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and also out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 20. He that testifyeth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen.</P>
<P>This is a gracious promise to all those that are looking and waiting for his coming for their help, when they are in trouble and distress for his sake; but it will be a de∣structive coming to the wicked that are not ware of it: This coming is a mystical coming, and not a personal and visible coming, (as will be at the great and last day of Judgment when every eye shall see him) but such a coming as is proved by Scripture testimony in the seventh verse of this Chapter. And to this gracious promise to all that are looking and waiting for his coming, ac∣cording
<PB N="262" REF="002172_0133_0FBC7AFFF1FEC078"/>to his promise, John makes reply by way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> request, in these words,</P>
<P>Even so come Lord Jesus.</P>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 21. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</P>
<P>This is the Authors conclusive salutation to the Church∣es, to whom he writes these things. Amen: Or, <HI>Even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be it.</HI></P>
