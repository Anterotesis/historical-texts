<P>THE Occasion of the Ensuing Dialogue it accounted for in the Introduction.</P>
<P>IT's the Fruit of a few Hours pains; being begun after Noon on <HI>Thursday,</HI> and finished before Noon next Day, without One tho't of it's ever being thus Exposed to the publick view.</P>
<P>BUT several of my Friends, upon Hearing of it, were desirous of having it Printed: which I the rather consented to, because divers for whose sake it was drawn up, were not present, when it was publickly delivered, who may possibly take the pains to read it.</P>
<P>I design'd to have polish'd it as well as I cou'd before I let it appear abroad; and (having other Business in hand) I deserv'd the Transcribing it, one Week after another, hoping for a more Con∣venient season still, to see about it. But at length despairing of any such leisure, and being unwilling to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soblige my Friends, by any longer Delay, I resolv'd to Transcribe it, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fast as I could, and have done so, without making any Material Alteration, save the Adding a few Quotations more than were in it at first. I therefore ask the Candour of my Critical Readers, (if any such will
<PB N="ii" REF="002481_0003_0FDB638C0EA97AA0"/>vouchsafe to look upon it:) And as for the Cap∣tiens, if they don't like it, I hope they will be so very kind, as to let it alone.</P>
<P>IF it may, <HI>by GOD's Blessing,</HI> be Effectual, to satisfy any piously Disposed Persons, (or stop the Mouths of hold gainsayers) in the dark, about Singing by Note; so that, This Excellent, <HI>Good Old Way</HI> of Singing, may be more promoted and practic'd in the Country, I've gained my Point. Now that it may be so and our Singing <HI>Dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> as well as Musical, is the Humble, Fervent Pray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. of the Unworthy Author,</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The <HI>Prologue,</HI> or <HI>Introduction.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE has seldom any <HI>Reformation,</HI> how Reasonable &amp; Needful soever, been bro't forward in the Church of Christ, or proposed to consideration; but thro' the Subtilty &amp; Malice of <HI>Sat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> and his <HI>Vassals,</HI> the weakness of the Gifts &amp; Graces of some of GOD's own Servants, and prevalency of Corruption remaining in them such Proposals and Essays, and the Promoters of them, have met with more or less Opposition.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ecclesiastical History</HI> of our <HI>Nations,</HI> yea of our own <HI>Land,</HI> doth furnish us with too many sorrowful Instances of this sort, both <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Modern.</HI> For, altho' the Pro∣fessed Design of our <HI>Fathers</HI> of Blessed Memory, in leaving the <HI>Pleasant L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd</HI> of their Nativity, and coming to this Country, <HI>then</HI> an <HI>Howling

<Q>was not a Reformation in Religion according to GOD's word, but <HI>a Progress in Reformation, or agoing forward unto any of the things of CHRIST, we are defective in;</HI></Q> (as the late <HI>Venerable Higgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sen,</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">The cause of God — Stated. An Elect.

I'le mention two or three Particulars here. First, We are fully satisfyed from our <HI>Platform</HI> of Dis∣cipline, as explained by the Famous Mr. <HI>R. Ma∣ther</HI> of <HI>Dorchester</HI> (the most <HI>Unexceptionable Ex∣positer,</HI> of said Platform. It being chiefly drawn up by him,
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>R. Ma∣ther</HI>'s Life, in Dr. <HI>C. Mather</HI>'s Magnal. Book 3. <HI>p.</HI> 128.</NOTE> and also from many other Writings of our most Eminent Divines, That the first Pastors of the N. English Churches were not <HI>Morellians</HI> or <HI>Brownists;</HI> and yet were very sensible that above 70 Years since, there were in too many in New-England, a <HI>strong Disposition</HI> to promote and practise upon, <HI>Brownistical &amp; Morellian</HI> Princi∣ples. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id not this give occasion to Mr. <HI>R. Ma∣ther</HI> to write a Treatise to prove, That <HI>whatever Privilege &amp; Liberty may belong to the Fraternity, the Rule of the Church belongs only to it's Presby∣tery?</HI>
<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>C. Matler</HI>'s Magnal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Did not this occasion Mr. <HI>Norton</HI>'s Expostulation, in
<PB N="3" REF="002481_0006_0FDB63939DF50970"/>his Epistle Dedicatory, before his Discourse of the Sufferings of Christ? where having said,
<Q>I Appeal to any competently judicious &amp; sober-minded man, if the denial of Rule in the Pres∣bytery, of a Decisive voice in the Synod, and of the Power of the Magistrate in matters of Reli∣gion, doth not in this point translate the Papal Power unto the Brotherhood of every Congrega∣tion;—He thus expresses himself; 'Thou that abborrest <HI>Epis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> dost thou commit <HI>Popery?</HI> Alas, Alas! Is there no medium between <HI>Bo∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce</HI> and <HI>Morellius,</HI> between <HI>Papacy &amp; Anar∣chy</HI>—? If there be a Mystery of Iniquity in the one, is there not an University of Iniquity in the other?</Q> <HI>Briefly</HI> Did not this early Disposi∣tion to <HI>Corahism,</HI> give occasion to Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> of Charlestown, to say,
<Q>Let not the way of the <HI>Ri∣gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seperatists</HI>—be acted over again here, till the Churches be buried in Confusion. In case of <HI>Divisions in Churches,</HI> hath not the <HI>Con∣gregational-Way</HI> Balm for this wound appointed by Christ, but <HI>Morellius</HI> must be rak'd out of his Grave to be the only Physician?</Q>

<P><HI>AGAIN,</HI> Was there not long ago great struggles to prevent <HI>the Rising Generation in this</HI>
<Q><HI>Country being bro't under the Government of Christ in his Church, so that when grown up and quali∣fied they might have Baptism for their Children?</HI></Q> Is not thus much intimated in Mr. <HI>R.

<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Magnal. B. 3. <HI>p.</HI> 129.</NOTE> And is not this very evident from that Passage in Mr. <HI>Norton</HI>'s Life,
<Q>This excellent Man, would fain have had in∣serted in the Platform, agreed by a Synod, in the Year 1647, certain Propositions concerning the <HI>Watch,</HI> which our Churches are to have over the <HI>Children</HI> born in them; which Propositions were certainly the <HI>first Principles</HI> of New-Eng∣land: Only the fierce Oppsitions of One emi∣nent Person, caused him—to forbear urging them any further; by which means, when those very <HI>Propesitions</HI> came to be advanc'd and em∣brac'd in another Synod, more than twice Seven Years after, many People did <HI>ignorantly count them Novelties.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem.</HI> B 3 <HI>p.</HI> 34.</NOTE> Whence I observe, <HI>En Paessant,</HI> That it is <HI>no New</HI> thing for some <HI>Weak</HI> People, to declaim against such things as <HI>Novelties,</HI> that were not generally practised within their Memo∣ry; tho' it's certain, they were highly esteemed, by the <HI>Wisest &amp; Best</HI> of the <HI>First Generation</HI> of New-England. But what Notion soever it pro∣ceeds from, we know, That <HI>Opposition</HI> to the work of <HI>Reformation,</HI> was judg'd by the Last <HI>Synod</HI> of these Churches to be one of the <HI>Provoking Evils</HI> of this Land.</P>
<P><HI>NOW,</HI> tho' I could easily produce several other Instances to illustrate this point before us, I'll take notice only of one more: And that is, The opposition made in too many T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wns to the <HI>Reformation of our Fsaimody,</HI> notwithstanding all
<PB N="5" REF="002481_0008_0FDB639617AE9770"/>that has been done to show the Reasonableness, Advantage &amp; Necessity of it. And this brings me to say, That I have us'd my best endeavours, according to the measure God has given me, to pre∣vent the rise &amp; afterwards the progress of such an unhappy Controversy in <HI>this place;</HI> yet then has been a great deal of Contention &amp; Uneasiness a∣mongst us, about Singing by Rule, and I perceive there are some <HI>yet</HI> dissatisfyed. <HI>Parva Scint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la maximum e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>citat Incendium.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NOW,</HI> it being my purpose to encourage <HI>Singing Meetings</HI> in the Town, in the long win∣ter-Evenings, I tho't it prudence to make another Essay, introductory to my setting forward such a <HI>Laudable Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tice,</HI> that <HI>if it be possible</HI> I might ease the Minds of all amongst us, that remain dissa∣tisfy'd on this score. And agreeably, I projected to draw up in form an <HI>Answer</HI> to all the <HI>Objecti∣ons,</HI> I could remember to have heard about this matter, and at a Meeting call'd for that purpose to communicate <HI>it,</HI> to such as would give their Attendance. <HI>For</HI> tho' in all my Conversation with Mankind, I never (in my opinion) observ'd a more <HI>Ridicu'ous &amp; Groundless</HI> Controversy; and altho' I have always esteem'd the <HI>Objections</HI> a∣gainst Singing by Rule, too <HI>weak &amp; ludicrous</HI> to be mention'd in a <HI>Sermen;</HI> and knowing that, <HI>Rectumest Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x sui ct Obliqui</HI> and consequently, that having prov'd abundantly (in more Ser∣mons than one, occasionally; and in one Sermon especially, Preach'd in sundry Congregations) That <HI>Singing by Rule,</HI> or according to the Pattern
<PB N="6" REF="002481_0009_0FDB63975711B748"/>in our Psalm-Book, <HI>is agreeable to the Will of God:</HI> and having also seen sundry <HI>Treatises</HI> on this head, that have been dispers'd about the Town; in one of which, the chief Objections of our <HI>Anti-Regular-Singers,</HI> [let me use <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Phrase for short∣ness] are designedly and particularly and very solidly answer'd, I <HI>held my self Excused</HI> from en∣deavouring an Answer to them. And that I might justly say in this case with the Apostle 1 Cor. 14.38. <HI>If any be ignorant, let hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e be igno∣rant.</HI> i. e. says Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI>
<Q>If any will not be bro't to a rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Understanding in these things, by all that I've said, but is still Contentious and U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruly, be it as his own Peril; I'll trouble my self no further about him, and don't you regard him.</Q>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">Clark's <HI>An∣notations is Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>FOR</HI> tho' I know it is the business &amp; duty of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel (acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to the Example of Christ and his Apostles) to answer weighty objections against their Doctrine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Practice, for the removing the Conscientious scru∣ples of the Weak &amp; Ignorant; and stopping the Mouths of Gain-sayers; yet I know also, that many objections are <HI>Refuted,</HI> by being <HI>Recited.</HI> The bare proposing of them, to Unprejudic'd Per∣sons, is a sufficient Representation of their absur∣dity. And as to others, of more <HI>Solidity,</HI> they are <HI>fully answer'd,</HI> tho' there be a <HI>Legion</HI> of them, if there be <HI>One Conclusive Argument</HI> on the <HI>other</HI> side. For Unquestionably, <HI>One</HI> good Argument <HI>for</HI> a thing, is of more value, than <HI>Ten</HI> Sophisms, or inconclusive arguments <HI>against</HI> it. And as I've
<PB N="7" REF="002481_0010_0FDB6398D34FA250"/>often had occasion to say publickly, <HI>If men will never Embrace any Articles in Religion, but such as there are no</HI> Objections <HI>against, they must</HI> re∣nounce all <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticles of the Christian Faith, and turn Scepticks in Religion.</HI> Having therefore as I said, sufficiently prov'd <HI>Singing by Rule,</HI> to be agreeable to the Will of GOD; I have sufficient∣ly proved all <HI>Objections</HI> against it, and Pleas to the contrary, to be utterly <HI>vain &amp; insignificant;</HI> and that such strive against God and oppose Reli∣gion, who oppose that: And hereupon (for some∣time) I supposed, as I said, I had no obligations upon me, to take the method I'm now come into.</P>
<P><HI>BUT</HI> being willing to become <HI>all things to all men</HI> (as far as I may with a good Conscience and to Edification) I tho't, if on a <HI>Week-Day,</HI> and in a <HI>Discourse,</HI> (not a <HI>Sermon</HI>) I could help any of my Nei'bours to light in this matter; and con∣vince any of them, that they'r out of the way, in speaking against this good Practice; It might be <HI>Time &amp; Pains well spent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND,</HI> accordingly having first sought to Heaven for Direction, and consider'd in what method to proceed, I at length concluded to draw up my Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'ts in the way of a <HI>Dialogue,</HI> between a <HI>Minister for</HI> Singing by Rule, and one of his <HI>Hearers</HI> vehemently set <HI>against</HI> it: Resolved to give the <HI>Hearer</HI> all the advantage I possibly could in the Dialogue, and to set his Arguments &amp; Ob∣jections in the best light, my little skill in argu∣ing would allow me: And then to give an answer, according to my power, agreable to the nature
<PB N="8" REF="002481_0011_0FDB639DDF477DF8"/>of the Objection, and the Objector, &amp; Answerer. Such Objections as are <HI>Grave,</HI> I'd answer Gravely; such as appear <HI>Conscientious,</HI> I'd give a <HI>soft</HI> answer to them; such as are <HI>Untoward,</HI> I'd answer with more <HI>Smartness;</HI> and if any will make <HI>Merry</HI> objections, they I be so kind as to take a Merry answer: For thus <HI>variously</HI> have the most Cele∣brated Writers, [<HI>Marvel.

<P><HI>Alas!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly <HI>N.</HI> I'm heartily <HI>sorry</HI> for your Un∣easiness about that matter, and the more so, be∣cause I'm satisfyed <HI>Satan</HI> has got a great <HI>Advan∣tage</HI> against you, or you'd never remain so <HI>out of tune,</HI> after all that has been said and done for your satisfaction.

<PB N="9" REF="002481_0012_0FDB639EEFFAF580"/>and <HI>make out</HI> your Charge, that Singing by Note is a <HI>New-way,</HI> or <HI>obtruded upon you;</HI> and I'll be your easy <HI>Proselite,</HI> and make you a Confession in <HI>Folio,</HI> if you desire it, that I've been deceiv'd and done very much amiss in this matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well Sir, but you'l be</HI> angry (<HI>they say</HI>) <HI>if I should be</HI> plain <HI>with you, and it will do no good, to have any Discourse with you about it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>And</HI> are none of your <HI>Party</HI> transported sometimes with anger, when they talk about Singing? But— If what you call <HI>Plainness,</HI> be down-right <HI>Rudeness,</HI> and the last <HI>Dogmaticalness,</HI> and if those that should come to <HI>learn of me</HI> and be instructed by me, come rather to <HI>dictate to me:</HI> and instead of (as the <HI>Apostle</HI> directs) <HI>Entreating me as a Father</HI> (supposing they think me out of the way) <HI>arraign</HI> my Administrations, and treat me with the last <HI>Scurrility,</HI> or at best, as if I were the <HI>Pupil,</HI> and they the <HI>Tutor;</HI> (I say, if so) I've <HI>just reason</HI> to be angry and I do well to let them know I am so. I should sin against God, and be∣tray the Authority I'm vested with, and vilify my office, if I should <HI>tamely</HI> suffer my self to be <HI>insulted,</HI> and not manifest my Resentments, with due discretion, <HI>Rebuking with sharpness</HI> where there may be occasion for it, as the Apostle di∣rects. Tho' I hope I do not forget, that the <HI>Ser∣vant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle un∣to all men: not a brawler, but apt to teach, patient, and in meekness instructing those that opppose themselves.</HI> And let me assure you, <HI>N.</HI> if you'l <HI>modestly</HI> produce your Allegations &amp; Objections,
<PB N="10" REF="002481_0013_0FDB63A057A1D1E8"/>I'll (by the help of God) use you, with all the <HI>Patience &amp; Calmness,</HI> with all the <HI>Goodness and Gentleness,</HI> you can desire. And this, I think, is fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly <HI>Sir, I think so too. And if any say otherwise, I must own they'r very unjust. If then you'r at leisure, Sir, and will give me leave to speak freely, and hear me patiently, I'll tell you what sticks with me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well N.</HI> I dare promise nothing in my own strength; and I must confess, there's scarce any thing apt to put me out of patience so soon, as to hear the <HI>Unsufferable Impertinces</HI> of some of you <HI>Anti-Regular-Singers;</HI> However (as I told you) I'll endeavour to hear you patiently, at least while you keep within the bounds (I don't say of good sense! but) of Modesty and good Manners. Let me then, hear your Objections: Only, let them be reduc'd to a proper order, that I may'nt be oblig'd to answer ten times to the same thing, but may know when I've done, and that our co∣ming together and this our Confabulation may be <HI>for the better and not for the worse.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why truly Sir, I don't know whether I've shall end to range my Objections to your mind. I believe you've heard all the Objections I have to produce, and if you'll please to dispose them in an agreeable Method, I'll endcavour, as my Me∣mory serves me, to keep to that Method.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You speak well N.</HI> and give me good hope, (tho' you look'd so Unpleasantly at first) that you come hither with a Teachable Disposition;
<PB N="11" REF="002481_0014_0FDB63A5287711E0"/>and if so, I doubt not, but I shall give you full sa∣tisfaction in every Article, e'r we've done. How∣ever, I'll promise you <HI>N.</HI> in this Conference, to act not only the part of a <HI>Respondent,</HI> but of a <HI>Moderator</HI> also, and will agreeably assist you, in stating and prosecuting your Objections, that you may have no cause to complain, <HI>You can't be heard.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, <HI>I thank you for your</HI> Civility. <HI>I'm sor∣ry I ran away with the</HI> Popular Clamour <HI>against you. I must needs own you treat</HI> me <HI>very Candidly.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well, N.</HI> I'm thankful, and rejoyce greathy, if I can give you content; for <HI>that</HI>'s my Ambi∣tion &amp; hearty Desire; and since you ask it of me, I'll tell you how you may Range your Ob∣jections, to make them look most <HI>Formidable</HI> and fit for business. Those that I've heard of, (tho' no doubt some of you <HI>A. R. S.</HI> that have such an <HI>incomparable talent</HI> at raising <HI>Objections</HI> against <HI>Mathematical Demonstrations,</HI> may have many more in store, against the Day of Battel) but those they've been pleas'd to favour us with the <HI>Know∣ledge of,</HI> are reducible to <HI>Three</HI> Heads. <HI>First,</HI> Some against the <HI>Thing it self,</HI> which you'r pleas'd to call a <HI>New Way</HI> of Singing, and the <HI>Consequents</HI> of it. And they are these <HI>Seven.</HI> (1) That it is a <HI>New Way,</HI> an <HI>Unknown Tongue.</HI> (2) That it is not so <HI>Melodicus</HI> as the <HI>Usual Way.</HI> (3) That there are so <HI>many Tunes,</HI> we shall never have done lear∣ning. (4) That the Practice of it <HI>gives Distur∣bance;</HI> Roils &amp; Exasperates men's Spirits; grieves sundry good People, and causes them to behave themselves indecently &amp; disorderly. (5) That is
<PB N="12" REF="002481_0015_0FDB63A7D52928F8"/><HI>Quakerish &amp; Popish,</HI> and introductive of <HI>Instru∣mental</HI> Musick. (6) That the <HI>Names</HI> given to the Notes are <HI>Baudy,</HI> yea <HI>Blasphemous.</HI> (7) That it is a <HI>Needless way,</HI> since their <HI>good Fathers</HI> that were strangers to it, are got to Heaven without it. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Some are against the <HI>Persons,</HI> that are the Promoters, Admirers &amp; Practitioners of this way. And they are Three. (1) It's said to be a <HI>Comrivance</HI> to get <HI>Money.</HI> (2) They spend <HI>too much time</HI> about learning; they tarry out a Nights Disorderly, and Family-Religion is neglected by the means. (3) They'r a Company of <HI>Young Upstarts</HI> that fall in with this way and set it for∣ward: and some of them are <HI>Lewd &amp; Loose Persons. Thirdly,</HI> The other Objections are against the <HI>Manner</HI> of <HI>bringing</HI> Regular Singing <HI>into the Church:</HI> And these are peculiarly level'd against my self. These are your <HI>Principal</HI> Ob∣jections; a'nt they, <HI>Nei'bor?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes <HI>Sir, They are so. But for my part, I don't father all of them; yet since we'r upon the Head; I should be glad to hear what you can say, (as the time will allow) to these several Objections, or any other that in Discourse may come tomind.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well N.</HI> I am willing to speak <HI>particularly</HI> to them; but there's so many of them, you can't expect I should say much to them, but I'll endea∣vour to speak to the purpose and eno', if you'll lay aside your Prejudices, and hear and judge impartially.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, <HI>I know that is my daty; and I dare do∣no
<PB N="13" REF="002481_0016_0FDB63A94FCDC6C0"/>otherwise, I should have no</HI> Charity <HI>for my self, if I were unwilling to see my Mistakes &amp; Errors, and</HI> to come to the Light <HI>for that end.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak <HI>Christianly, N.</HI> O that there were such an heart in all of you, that make these Ob∣jections! Please then to begin with your <HI>first set</HI> of Objections. There's a <HI>perfect number</HI> of 'em; and if they wou'd hold weight, when try'd in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, they'd carry the Case against all the Skilful Singers under heaven. Come, <HI>N</HI> let's hear them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nay, Sir, Proy be</HI> Serious, <HI>and don't</HI> run up∣on me <HI>neither! I don't come hither to be laugh'd at.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee <HI>N.</HI> keep your Temper, and allow me to <HI>handle the matter</HI> according to the <HI>Nature</HI> of it <HI>(or I shall not do it wisely)</HI> and I'll be as good as my word; If I find one <HI>solid</HI> objection in the whole <HI>Croud,</HI> I'll endeavour a solid answer.</P>
<P>Come, let me hear your first Objection; and âdone with Preambles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why Sir, my first Objection is this, That it is a</HI> New Way, <HI>an</HI> unknown Tongue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for this Objection, <HI>N.</HI> you may see it solidly answer'd in a little <HI>Treatise,</HI> Entitul'd, <HI>The Reasonableness of Singing by Note;</HI> which Book was well approv'd of by very good judges of Books. I advise you, if you can, to get that Treatise, and read it, with humble Supplication to the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> that He wou'd open your Eyes to see the Truth there held forth unto you: And if you can't otherwise procure it, I'll furnish you with it. — Now besides that you find it
<PB N="14" REF="002481_0017_0FDB63AD8AE0ED68"/>there truly asserted, That this you call a <HI>New Way,</HI> was study'd, known and approv'd of in our <HI>Col∣lege,</HI> from the very <HI>Foundation</HI> of it; <HI>(and tho' for some Years of later time it was unhappily neglected, yet (blessed be God) it is again reviven, &amp; hope will be ever continued in that School of the Pro∣phets.</HI>) And besides, that it is <HI>there</HI> observ'd that the <HI>Notes</HI> of the Tunes were plac'd in our <HI>New-England Psalm Books</HI> from the <HI>Beginning,</HI> with general <HI>Directions</HI> for Singing by <HI>Note;</HI> and that there are many of the <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>Grand-Chil∣dren</HI> of the first Setlers of <HI>New-England,</HI> who are now living, that well <HI>remember</HI> their <HI>encesters</HI> Singing by <HI>Note;</HI> I say, besides all this, It's evi∣dent, that Singing by Note is no Novelty, since
<Q>Musick is one of the <HI>Liberal Sciences,</HI> (or, (as <HI>Alsted</HI> terms it) a Mathematical Science subal∣ternate to Arithmetick,</Q> and may be call'd a spe∣cial Arithmetick,) has been so accounted in all Ages, and amongst all learned Nations; and was doubtless Coaeval to, if not more ancient than In∣strumental Musick; of which <HI>Jubal</HI> was the <HI>In∣venter,</HI> as <HI>Moses</HI> tell us, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.21.</P>
<P><HI>Moreover,</HI> the very Tunes prick'd in <HI>our Psalm Books,</HI> are with little or no variation in Mr. <HI>Ra∣venserests</HI> Psalm-Book, printed above a <HI>Hundred</HI> Years ago; in One of which, there's an account of the Gentlemens Names, that made our Tunes.</P>
<P><HI>Furthermore,</HI> (as is evident from a Psalm-Book of Elder <HI>Chipman</HI>'s, now in my hands) The Church of <HI>Plymouth</HI> (which was the <HI>First</HI> Church in <HI>New-England</HI>) made use of <HI>Ainsworth</HI>'s version of the
<PB N="15" REF="002481_0018_0FDB63B0102FCC80"/>Psalms till the Year 1692. For altho' our <HI>New-England Version</HI> of the Psalms was composed by sundry Hands, and compleated by President <HI>Dun∣sier,</HI>
<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="marg">Magnal. <HI>B.</HI> 3 <HI>p.</HI> 100.</NOTE> about the Year 1640; yet that Church did not use it, it seems, till about Two &amp; Fifty Years after, but stuck to <HI>Ainsworth;</HI> and till about 1682. their <HI>excellent</HI> Custom was to Sing <HI>without</HI> Reading the Line. Now, in <HI>Ainsworths</HI> Psalm-book, there are about 44 Tunes, and but 4 of them that I ever saw (to my knowledge) any where, save in <HI>that</HI> Psalm-book: And there the Tune is pricked as in <HI>Ravenscrosis</HI> &amp; <HI>Playford</HI>'s at the beginning of the Psalm, or you there find a <HI>Reference</HI> to the Tune the Psalm is to be sung in, so that all the <HI>Chief Masician</HI> or <HI>Chorister</HI> had to do, was to give the <HI>Pitch</HI> and lead the Tune, and all were to sing according to the Notes in the Psalm Book.</P>
<P><HI>Briefly,</HI> all that know any thing to purpose a∣bout Singing by Note, know as certainly, as they can any thing, that what is now call'd the <HI>Usual Way,</HI> in opposition to Singing by Note, is but a <HI>Defective Imitation</HI> of the Regular Way. And in some Places, they've kept nearer to the Rule, and in others, they've varied more from it. And wherever they differ any thing considerable, their Singing, as to the external part of it, is so far Defective and Irregular. And,</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Singing Skilfully or by Note is express∣ly &amp; by just consequence requir'd in the <HI>Word of GOD;</HI> as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 33, 3. &amp; 47.7. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.22. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.31. <HI>Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1.14. with the Third Command,
<PB N="16" REF="002481_0019_0FDB63B18E0BD340"/>and many other Scriptures; several of which you've heard me Expound. So that your <HI>Usual Way</HI> of Singing is <HI>but of Yesterday,</HI> an upstart No∣velty, a Deviation from the Regular, which is the only <HI>Scriptural good Old Way of Singing;</HI> much elder than our Fathers, or Fathers Grand-fathers; as we could easily further evince were it needful; But they that won't be satisfyed with what I've now offer'd to consideration, or with what is in the Book refer'd to, <HI>neither would they be per∣swaded, tho' one arose from the dead l</HI> What say you <HI>N?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say! <HI>Why truly Sir, I'm</HI> amaz'd <HI>I should be so long deluded &amp; Hood-winck'd. I</HI> must own, <HI>You have</HI> Antiquity <HI>on your side, or I shall forseit the Character of a Reasonable Creature, if things are as you tell me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I aver what I've said to be so; and I'm ready to produce the Books to prove what I've asserted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir; <HI>I'm obliged to take your Word in some things of greater Consequence than this, and there∣fore I can believe you as to the</HI> History <HI>you've gi∣ven me of this Matter: if any still besitate, let them take the Pains I've done, to satisfy themselves. Let them</HI> Come and see!</P>
<P>But <HI>what do you say, Sir, to it's being an</HI> Un∣known Tongue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say there is in it, on <HI>Allusion</HI> to the <HI>A∣postles</HI> expression of Praying or Preaching in an Unknown Tongue: And tho' it's used with a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Confidence, It is a comparison without
<PB N="17" REF="002481_0020_0FDB63B754B7C988"/>any similitude, as the Objector supposes there is. Indeed, if we propos'd to Sing in <HI>Latin,</HI> as the Papists do, this comparison would be just. But tho' we possibly Sing Tunes that some in the Congregation can't sing, yet we sing the same Psalms we ever us'd to sing. Yea, if we throw by our Psalm Books and Sing only <HI>F. S. L.</HI> in the Meeting-house, as some have been so weak, as to suppose we intended; tho' alas! We'r so dull, we should I ever have thot of such a thing, if our surmising Objectors, had not suggested it; but, had we done so, there had been some room for such a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Objection.</HI> But verily, this Objecti∣on will hold against Singing any Tune, for <HI>there is to one Tune,</HI> that <HI>all</HI> in the Congregation that try to sing and do well to do so, are <HI>Masters</HI> of, and conseconently in your sense they'r an <HI>Unknown Tongue</HI> to them. And surely Persons may sing the Words, the Matter to be sung, in a Congre∣gation when there is enô to lead the Tune, tho' they were never acquainted with one Note of the Tune before, and that very acceptably to God, if their hearts are right with Him. But, let me hear your next Objection, and try if there's any more force in <HI>That,</HI> than in <HI>This.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>My <HI>second Objection is This,</HI> That this Sing∣ing by Note is not so Melodious &amp; Pleasant, as the Usual Way: <HI>Some have call'd it</HI> Yelling. <HI>Others have said, they'd as leeve hear the</HI> Wolves howl. <HI>And for</HI> my own <HI>part, I can't</HI> fancy <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. One good man said,</HI> He never had heard <HI>Christ</HI>'s Voice <HI>in this way of Singing since it came up.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002481_0021_0FDB63B8552BAD80"/>
<HI>M.</HI> As to this Objection also; you may find it sufficiently answer'd in the Book I before re∣fer'd to. And not to enlarge here, I'll honestly confess to you that before I was pretty well ac∣quainted with the Rules of Singing, I rather <HI>fan∣cy'd</HI> the <HI>Usual,</HI> than the Regular way: But my <HI>Judgment</HI> satisfy'd me the Regular must be best. And I know, one reason why my Fancy for the present was most gratify'd with my singing the Usual way, was, because I was used to <HI>that,</HI> and not Master of <HI>the other.</HI> And hence it is, that <HI>Home is Home, be it never so Homely.</HI> And even so the miserable <HI>Hottentots</HI> (pardon the Comparison!) who think to adorn themselves with the <HI>Gats of Beasts,</HI> with all the Garbage in them; prefer these Guts to a <HI>Chain of Gold,</HI> because it's what they'r used to, and it pleases their Fancies. But surely if they'd exercise <HI>Reason,</HI> the Ornaments us'd by other People, are more beautiful and be∣coming; or else all the Civiliz'd &amp; Polite part of the World are deceiv'd and those Dregs of Man∣kind are in the Right of it.</P>
<P><HI>Furthermore.</HI> I've said to some of my Hearers, that if any of you <HI>A. R. S</HI>'s would take the pains to <HI>acquaint your selves</HI> with the <HI>Rules</HI> of Singing, so as to be able to Sing 6 or 7 Tunes tolerably by Art, <HI>If they did not then say as I do,</HI> that singing by Note is Unspeakably preferrible to singing the Usual way; <HI>I'd give up the Cause as to them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Besides,</HI> There are <HI>few</HI> of you <HI>A. R. S</HI>'s, that ever heard Singing in the several parts of Musick; and some of you don't know the <HI>Difference</HI> be∣tween
<PB N="19" REF="002481_0022_0FDB63B9CFC61DD0"/>the Treble &amp; Bass. Hence I heard one, (that your Fraternity set much by) say, that <HI>the Treble &amp; Bass must be sung with the same Voice!</HI> And another was pleas'd to say in my Hearing, That one Sabbath-day in a certain Meet∣ing-House, there was <HI>Four sorts</HI> of Singing! for some sung <HI>Rowly Way;</HI> and some sung the <HI>Usual Way;</HI> and some sung the <HI>New Way;</HI> and some sung <HI>Bass.</HI> Whence I learnt that the Usual Way at one Town, and the Usual Way at another, were very <HI>Different: Fas est</HI> —. Now there is no man can judge aright of the Melody of Singing by Note; that has not heard Tunes sung in the several parts, or in Consort; and that not by <HI>Begin∣ners</HI> only, but by <HI>ideptists,</HI> or at least persons <HI>well skill'd</HI> in the Science of Musick; any more, than a man can judge of <HI>Reading,</HI> by Hearing one Read that <HI>just begins</HI> to put his <HI>Syllables</HI> together.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Consider <HI>N.</HI> that the <HI>Beauty</HI> and Har∣mony of Singing consists very much in a just <HI>Timing &amp; Turning</HI> the Notes: every Singer keep∣ing the exact <HI>Pitch</HI> the Tune is set in, according to the part he Sings. Now you in the <HI>Usual</HI> Way, are very <HI>faulty</HI> on this account. Hence you may remember, that in our Congregation we us'd fre∣quently to have some People Singing a Note or Two, <HI>after the rest</HI> had done. And <HI>you</HI> common∣ly strike the Notes not <HI>together,</HI> but <HI>one after a∣nother;</HI> one being half way thro' the second Note, before his Nei'bour has done with the First, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Now this is just as Melodious to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>-Musical-Ear, as <HI>Aesop</HI> was Beautiful to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ous</HI> Eye.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002481_0023_0FDB63BB5DAACD88"/>
<HI>Once more,</HI> I put it to your Conscience <HI>N.</HI> who are the <HI>Best Judges</HI> of Melody, Such as can Sing <HI>both</HI> the Usual Way and by Note; or they that can Sing <HI>neither;</HI> or only the <HI>Usual Way?</HI> Why truly <HI>N.</HI> the man deserves to be more severely stigmatiz'd, than some can well bear, that won't readily say, the <HI>Former:</HI> And if so, we're sure the Case will be decided in our favour. For the <HI>Chief Musicians</HI> in our Country &amp; Nation, recom∣mend the Regular Way, as Unspeakably most Melodious; and our Reason and Sense tell us so likewise: Whereas it is only an Ungovern'd Fan∣cy tells you the contrary. This several amongst us, declare upon Experience.</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> suppose your way is after all, by you estee∣med most Melodious; yet surely the Conse∣quents of People's learning to Sing by Rule, should prevail with all that love God, to deny their own Fancy, rather than in the least discou∣rage such a Method of Singing For, I trust we'r all agreed that Singing the Praises of GOD is a Duty incumbent on us Christians. And if it be a Duty to Sing, it is a Duty to use our endeavours to learn to Sing. For we don't come <HI>Singing,</HI> but <HI>Crying</HI> into the World. And tho' some have a more Musical Genius than others, yet Men don't Sing as <HI>naturally,</HI> as <HI>Pigs Squeak,</HI> or Children Cry; but their Genius must be <HI>Cultivated,</HI> e're they can Sing with skill &amp; understanding. Now if we are to learn any Art we shall surely take the <HI>E first</HI> and most <HI>Speedy</HI> way to learn it; and this generally speaking is by acquainting our
<PB N="21" REF="002481_0024_0FDB63BC06C8C548"/>selves with the <HI>Rudiments &amp; Rules</HI> of that Art. If we would teach our Children <HI>to Read,</HI> we don't set them first into <HI>Chronicles,</HI> but to their <HI>Horn∣book</HI> or Primmer. And so if we would learn to Sing, we must first learn to <HI>raise our Notes.</HI>— And I profess were I to learn the <HI>Usual</HI> way for my life, I'd first learn to Sing by <HI>Note.</HI> And I'll engage, every Master of Song among us will say with me. And this we know, that there are Mul∣titudes, can learn to Sing no <HI>other way,</HI> that can learn <HI>by Rule.</HI> And will you shut out so great a part of Mankind from joyning in the Worship of GOD, for a <HI>meer</HI> Fancy, and a <HI>Groundless</HI> one? When if you turn the Tables, all that can learn the Usual way easily, can if they will learn the other.—I might here (by the way) say some∣thing to a <HI>Silly Objection,</HI> Iv'e heard, that it can't be right to Sing by Note; because it's so <HI>easy to learn it.</HI> Surely no man need go Seven years to <HI>College</HI> to know how to answer this! Won't you suffer your Children to learn to <HI>Read,</HI> or <HI>Write,</HI> or <HI>Cypher,</HI> because some, yea the generality of <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Trung Men,</HI> learn all these things with a great deal of <HI>Facility;</HI> whilst such as did not learn them when Young, can never learn them, without the greatest <HI>Difficulties,</HI> if at all.</P>
<P><HI>Besides,</HI> sometimes you object. It's so <HI>Difficult</HI> to learn to Sing by Rule, that it's more <HI>pains</HI> than <HI>profit:</HI> more cost than worship. Thus do your Objections <HI>Militate</HI> with one another; and I'll leave you to reconcile 'em; or e'n let 'em fight it out! So then your <HI>Usual Way</HI> of Singing,
<PB N="22" REF="002481_0025_0FDB63BF0EBEA880"/>(wherein you Sing commonly the Treble only, not keeping your Pitch, not keeping Time; or turning your Notes alike) is as much less Melo∣dious (to a Musical Ear &amp; proper Judge of Har∣mony) than our Singing a Tune in the several parts of Musick with great Exactness, as a Tune play'd by an <HI>Unskilful</HI> Hand, or an <HI>Untun'd In∣strument,</HI> is less Melodious than the same Tune play'd on a <HI>Well-tun'd</HI> Instrument, with great Accuracy, by a <HI>Skilful Musician.</HI> And this I think you may Conceive of, or you'r neighty dull of Apprehension.</P>
<P><HI>And,</HI> whereas you tell me, One Good man said, <HI>He had not heard</HI> Christ's <HI>Voice in this way of Sing∣ing by Note,</HI> or to that purpose —: I speak solemnly, The man that talks so, has just reason to consider, and others to suspect, whether <HI>He knows</HI> Christ's Voice. Sure I am that the same person, as good as he is, (if I am rightly inform'd) betray'd so much ignorance of that <HI>Sacred Voice,</HI> that I could scarce have suspected a well-grown <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b,</HI> much less a <HI>Sheep</HI> of Christs Flock, could have been guilty of; in aslerting three things; (1) That <HI>Instrumental</HI> Musick was an Invention of <HI>David,</HI> and not of Divine Institution, even un∣der the Law: tho' the Roval Prophet tells us, <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1.4. <HI>This,</HI> i. e. Instrumental Musick was a <HI>Statute in Jacob and a Law of the God of Israel.</HI> (2) He asserted, that if Instrumental Musick were of Divine Appointment, <HI>Organs</HI> were not. Where∣as the Jewish Church, <HI>however,</HI> are expressly ex∣horted. <HI>Isal.</HI> 130.4. to Praise God, with <HI>Organs.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002481_0026_0FDB63C1564BE6A8"/>(3) He was pleased to say, that if Instrumental Musick and particularly <HI>Organs,</HI> were of Divine Institution, yet the <HI>Jews</HI> did not play on them, upon the <HI>Sabbath-Day.</HI> Whereas, in the 150 Psalm the People of God are directed to Praise Him in the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> with <HI>Organs.</HI> And in the 92 Psalm, Entituled, <HI>A Isalm or Song for the Sabbath-Day;</HI> It's said, <HI>It's a good thing to give thinks unto the LORD.</HI>— 3. v. <HI>With an Instrument of ten Strings</HI> &amp;c. Now unless, your good man, knew Christ's Voice better in his Word, that has an Im∣mediate relation to Musick; I'd advise him, ne∣ver to Utter any more such complaint lest he oblige us to conclude, he's as <HI>shy</HI> of his <HI>Bible,</HI> as some <HI>A. R. S</HI>'s are of some <HI>other</HI> Books printed for their Instruction.</P>
<P>N. <HI>Sir! I can't but say, you've</HI> convinc'd <HI>me, there's no manner of sense in</HI> this <HI>Objection; and if you as fully answer the Rest, I'll never open my mouth more against Singing by Note.</HI></P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> Well said <HI>N.</HI> let us hear your <HI>next</HI> Ob∣jection. But you must excuse me from speaking so largely to most of the other Objections, or I shall grow weary, and must adjourn to another Opportunity.</P>
<P>N. <HI>Sir, my next Objection is,</HI> That there are so many <HI>Tunes</HI> we shall never have done learning, 'em. <HI>If you'd set any bounds, that we might know when we should have done, there would be some sense in it. But some tells us, there's an 150 Tunes, and we need do nothing else but learn to Sing. And I hear that one of our New Singers, (that is a</HI> Pillar

<P><HI>M.</HI> A goodly saving indeed! You'd best get it annex'd to the sayings of the seven wise men of <HI>Greece,</HI> in the next Edition of 'em.

(which no doubt is sufficient to puzzle <HI>fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le</HI> and all his Followers, to solve,) I'll tell you <HI>N.</HI> That as all the <HI>English</HI> Books in the World are composed of 24 Letters, and when a Child has learn't those Letters thorowly; and learn't to spell and put his Syllables together, he can read, in <HI>another Lad's Book,</HI> as well as in <HI>his own:</HI> and does not complain,—O! if there were but 10 or 12 Books, I could learn to read with some Courage; but when I hear of so many Thou∣sand, I'm utterly disheartn'd, I shall never have done, I must do nothing else but learn to read! So, in <HI>Musick,</HI> all Tunes are composed of 7 Notes, and when a person has learn perfectly to <HI>Name</HI> &amp; <HI>Raise</HI> his Notes and <HI>Turn</HI> his Thirds; He may with a little Practice, if within the <HI>age of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pline,</HI> and apt to learn, Sing any Tune he sees prick'd at first sight, or with a little Conning over, or hearing another Sing it; and here's no occasion to complain of the Multiplicity of Tunes; for he's still at his liberty to Sing what he pleases.</P>

As to <HI>Stamdish,</HI> it has been Sung for many years, (as I'm inform'd) in the Church of <HI>N.

And as for <HI>Lon∣don-New,</HI> it was Sung at the <HI>Publick Election,</HI> in∣comparably well, and to good acceptance above a Year ago. And I never propose to set any Tune Publickly, but what I'm assur'd <HI>there's enough to lead</HI> the Congregation in the Singing of it; and if they won't <HI>follow,</HI> you may guess who's to blame. — Besides, <HI>Variety delights.</HI> And it's strange that People, that are so <HI>set against stated Forms of Prayer,</HI> should be <HI>so fond of Singing half a Dozen Tunes,</HI> nay <HI>One</HI> Tune, from Sabbath to Sabbath; till every body <HI>Nauseates</HI> it, that has any Relish of Singing.

<P>M. A <HI>just</HI> Resolution truly! I wish you may keep of that mind. Let us hear your <HI>next</HI> Ob∣jection.</P>
<P>N. <HI>Sir, you make such</HI> fearful work <HI>with my Objections I begin to grow</HI> asham'd <HI>of 'em. How∣ever, you weat me kindly (tho' you put upon me now &amp; then, I 'count) and I'm willing to heat what you'll say to the other Objections. My Fourth Objection.</HI> —</P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> Nay, Prithee <HI>N.</HI> don't mistake me neither. Don't be uneasy at my manner of Expression. For I assure yea, on the word of a Minister (and that's
<PB N="27" REF="002481_0030_0FDB63CA59856AB0"/>sacred with me) It is not any Man's <HI>Person,</HI> but the Objections against Regular Singing, I'd ex∣pose the weakness of. For notwithstanding the <HI>Rude &amp; Unchristian</HI> Treatment I have met with from some <HI>A. R. S</HI>'s, I can freely over-look it, and say in the <HI>Apostles</HI> sense, <HI>Ye have not injured me at all:</HI> But as to the <HI>Objections</HI> against Sing∣ing by Note, <HI>I know 'em to be Ridiculous;</HI> and I wish that <HI>you all</HI> could, or would see it, as fully as I do. And let this be for an Answer, once for all, to your complaints of my putting on you. And when [<HI>I</HI>] use <HI>such</HI> Objections against any thing, I'll give you, or any Man else leave to put as much upon me. But bring out your Fourth Objection, my Friend! for the time spends, and I long to be better Employ'd: or at a more agre∣able Entertainment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>The Singing Meeting suc∣ceeding this Exercise.</HI></P>
<P>N. <HI>Sir, my ary Objection was,</HI> That the Practice of Singing by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re makes Disturbance, <HI>roils and exasperates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> grieves good People, and couses them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have themselves indecently and disorderly: And seeing there's a great many speak against it, and it's en indifferent thing, methinks it's pity that there should be so much Noise and Towse about it, and that so much pains should be taken in this matter, when there are things of greater Consequence</HI> —.</P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> That there are things of greater Moment, (even in the Doctrine of Singing the Divine Praises) Heaven &amp; Earth are witness, <HI>I always assert.</HI> But that Singing by Note is <HI>Lawful, Ex∣pedient</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002481_0031_0FDB63CE878F5D20"/>and <HI>Best,</HI> and should be endeavour'd by <HI>some,</HI> and encouraged by <HI>all,</HI> These are <HI>suffering Truths,</HI> that ought to be born witness to, where our Silence will be Construed a <HI>Denial</HI> or <HI>Dispi∣sing</HI> of <HI>them.</HI> Indeed, if these points were <HI>Proble∣matical,</HI> or Disputed amongst <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Learned</HI> Men; there were some sense (I acknowledge) in this Objection. But (alas) the Case is far otherwise. And (let the Man make what Figure he will, and let his Coat be of what Fashion or Colour, or other Quality it will) I profess I'll not affix either of those <HI>Honourary Epithets</HI> to his Name, that won't readily own, that whoever will Dispute those points, may also Dispute <HI>Whether Two &amp; Two make Four!</HI> A learned Question in truth! For my part, GOD helping me, I'll ne∣ver betray any known Truth of Religion, or the Confessors of it, to secure my own ease; tho' all this world were against me! I know who has said, <HI>Whoso shall break one of these least Commands, and teach men so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of God,</HI> i. e. without Repentance, he shall never come thither. And again; <HI>These things</HI> (weigh∣tier matters) <HI>ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other</HI> (the lesser points) <HI>undone.</HI> These Text are no part of the <HI>Apocrypha.</HI> And I appeal to all men of sense, whether Christians are to make <HI>Reason &amp; the Word of God</HI> the Rule of their Faith and Practice, or the <HI>Cheigo</HI>'s &amp; <HI>Whimsies</HI> of some, who have <HI>Cor Bonum</HI> (we <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope</HI>) but not <HI>Caput Regulatum</HI> (we'r <HI>sure</HI>) i. e.

<P><HI>And</HI> whereas you were speaking of acquainting our selves with the Rules of Singing as an <HI>Indif∣ferent thing,</HI> I utterly <HI>deny</HI> it to be so, as to <HI>all</HI> persons. Indeed, as to some <HI>Elderly</HI> People, and such as have a natural <HI>Incapacity</HI> to learn, doubt∣less God does not expect it of them. But as to <HI>all</HI> that have a Competent Ability, and Conveni∣ent Opportunity to learn, <HI>my firm belief is,</HI> That God as <HI>really</HI> requires it of them, as He does any thing in His Word; and particularly as He does Singing.

<P>Again, Whereas you say, <HI>There are many speak against it:</HI> I answer, <HI>Not every where.</HI> It is not so, at <HI>Boston</HI> (that I can learn) nor at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where People have as much Ability &amp; Opportu∣nity surely, to know What's wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Town,</HI> and some others in the Country. But granting it were <HI>so,</HI> That's no <HI>solid Argument</HI> against it; for, the <HI>Gospel</HI> it self was said to be <HI>every where spoken against;</HI> and I pray God, it may never be said so again, of <HI>some Articles</HI> in Divinity, of Unspeakably greater Moment, than Singing by Note.

<P><HI>Besides,</HI> supposing Regular Singing is spoken <HI>against</HI> by <HI>many,</HI> Is it not also spoken &amp; preached, and printed <HI>for,</HI> and that by as wise and good Men, Men as able &amp; faithful to judge in this mat∣ter as any Anti-Regular-Singer upon earth, and no Reflection on them?</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> whereas you say, Many <HI>good</HI> People are
<PB N="31" REF="002481_0034_0FDB63D410184510"/><HI>griev'd</HI> about it. I answer, <HI>That's none of their goodness,</HI> I'm sure; but their Pittiable <HI>weakness</HI> at best. And for any to be angry at it, is to be angry <HI>without Cause,</HI> if ever men were so. And you remember, what <HI>Christ</HI> has said of such, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.22. And tho' we'r Commanded not to <HI>give</HI> offence, we'r not Commanded, not to let People <HI>take</HI> offence. And if Good People are offended with us, when we give them no reason to be so, that's our <HI>unhappiness,</HI> and not our <HI>Sin.</HI> The <HI>wo</HI> belongs to such as <HI>take</HI> offence, where there is none <HI>given.</HI> And if many Good People are <HI>griev'd;</HI> I'm perswaded as many and as Good as they are, are <HI>rejoyc'd</HI> at this matter, and look upon the re∣vival of the <HI>study &amp; Practice</HI> of the Art of Musick, as an happy Omen that <HI>the time of the singing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irds is coming on.</HI> And on the other Hand, Are <HI>they</HI> not, with good Reason, displeased and offended with you <HI>A.R.S's?</HI> Which some of you, and some (that find their account in it, I presume) that Connive at and Countenance you, seem uncon∣cern'd about. Whom, if I were worthy to ad∣vise, I'd beg them to remember, that there are some Patrons of Singing by Note, understand themselves as well, and make as much Consci∣ence of their Duty, as they do; and are as loth to offend when they can avoid it, as they are: But they remember, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.23. But let who will be Displeas'd in the Case, I'm Confident the GOD of <HI>Order</HI> (who as <HI>Alsted</HI> says, is the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> and <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utor</HI> of all Harmony) is <HI>well-pleased</HI> that Singing by Note is promoted in these Chur∣ches,

<P>Farthermore, As to it's <HI>roiling</HI> the Spirits of <HI>Irreligious</HI> Men, and giving Disturbance; — If you'll take the pains to read the <HI>Treatise</HI> I've refer'd you to, several times, and the <HI>Sermon</HI> about <HI>Prejudice</HI> dispers'd in these Towns, you may find an <HI>answer</HI> to it, and it may be to your Satisfaction. For, I remember, I heard one of the wifest and best men in this Town, say, to one of the oldest,
<Q>Sir (said He) I was my self as much in the Dark about Singing by Note as you are, but when I heard the Sermon from that Text, <HI>Come and see,</HI> I went Home (<HI>and advised</HI>) and made it a Case of prayer, and read over the Treatise (before quoted) and really I found so much <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Scripture</HI> for it, that I'm satisfy'd, <HI>'Tis of GOD.</HI></Q>—An abun∣dant Recompence, I acknowledge, for all my Pains and Sufferings occasioned by that Sermon!</P>

And I would yet <HI>Gladly spend and be spent</HI> to quiet you in a way of GOD; and yield to any thing, I may Wisely and with a good Conscience; but if <HI>after all.</HI> Men will be <HI>Humorsome,</HI> and wilfully blind, and fly from <HI>Books</HI> offered for their Illu∣mination and Conviction, as they would from a <HI>Rattle-Snake,</HI> as the manner of some has been, I say, I know who has said, Jer. 15.19, 20. <HI>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</HI> i. e. says Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his <HI>Annot.</HI>

<P>N. Sir, <HI>I find already you'll</HI> Non-suit <HI>me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these Objections, and therefore I'll only mention them: I shall never plead to 'em. My</HI> Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th <HI>Ob∣jection was, that the</HI> Names <HI>given to the Notes are</HI> Baudy, <HI>yea</HI> Blasphemous.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002481_0037_0FDB63DB93C09848"/>
<HI>M.</HI> Verily, my Friend, <HI>Apollo</HI> himself, that Laugh'd but once a Year, could never forbear Giggling again, at such <HI>Comical</HI> Objections. <HI>Quis talia sando temperet a Risu?</HI> These Objections certainly labour of the Malady, of <HI>Obscurum</HI> per <HI>Obscurius,</HI> to prove a dark point by that which is more dark. In plain English, <HI>N.</HI> A <HI>Broad Laugh,</HI> is all the Answer such <HI>Whimsical</HI> Objecti∣ons deserve: or rather, a hearty <HI>Scoul;</HI> or, Deep <HI>Sigh,</HI> to observe the Doleful Effects of Man's A∣postacy. To be oppress'd with such Objections would <HI>make a wise man mad,</HI> Eccl. 7.7.</P>
<P>However, To <HI>gratify</HI> you <HI>N.</HI> I'll say in a few words! Tho' we understand <HI>Quakerism</HI> and <HI>Popery</HI> as well, and hate them as much as you do; yet, I'll never <HI>despise</HI> what is <HI>Laudable</HI> in them. I admire the Quakers <HI>neat</HI> and <HI>modest Dress,</HI> and condemn nothing in it; but the wearing it, with <HI>Affected Singularity.</HI> And if the Papists sing a better <HI>Tune,</HI> or with a better <HI>Air,</HI> than we do, I'd as soon <HI>imitate them,</HI> and a thousand times sooner, than the <HI>Honestest</HI> man among you, that has <HI>no Skill</HI> in Singing. You've heard frequently, That <HI>Truth is as precious in the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>as in the Churches of</HI> New-England. And verily, the <HI>Papists</HI> in many Articles, and particularly in their Bodily Devotion, are a <HI>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me</HI> to many <HI>Pro∣testants!</HI> If Papists will come Early to Meeting, and behave themselves in the Worship of GOD with <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Wakefulness,</HI> must I (under a pretence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abhorring Popery) make a Trade of <HI>Coming,</HI> when <HI>Prayer</HI> is just <HI>done;</HI> or <HI>run out,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="002481_0038_0FDB63DFC2E2B178"/>needlesly and unexemplarily, before the Exercise is ended; and go away <HI>without the Blessing;</HI> or sit and <HI>Sleep,</HI> or Loll my Head on the Seat, as if I did so, in the time of Divine Worship, as—? <HI>Away, Away!</HI> The Papists themselves will rise up in judgment against Protestants, that act at this Rate, and will condemn them!</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> since you make a Noise (tho' no <HI>pleasant</HI> one) about <HI>Instrumental Musick,</HI> I'll give you an unanswerable argument, that may put you out of all pain about it: And that is, That, truly, <HI>it's</HI> too <HI>Chargeable</HI> a peice of Worship ever to obtain amongst us; and you may depend upon it, that such as are not willing to be at the Cost of a <HI>Bell,</HI> to call the People together on the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> and of a <HI>Man</HI> to <HI>ring</HI> it (as it is with too many amongst us) will never be so <HI>Extravagant</HI> as to lay out their Cash, (especially, now Mony is so scarce) to buy <HI>Organs,</HI> and pay an <HI>Artist</HI> for playing on 'em.</P>
<P>N. <HI>Yea,</HI> Sir, <HI>But what won't People do for their</HI> Wills?</P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> Why truly <HI>N.</HI> it's <HI>well tho't of!</HI> They'll do e'n just any thing. Agreeably, I remember I once heard a Grave yet Facetious Divine ob∣serving, <HI>That Corruption will do more than Grace at Building Meeting-Houses.</HI> But yet, I'll tell you <HI>N.</HI> for your comfort, when People grow so extream <HI>flush</HI> of their Money, and so <HI>wilful</HI> as to lay it out upon <HI>Organs</HI> (if you and I live to that Day) I can help you to several Arguments, that some eminent Divines have invented against
<PB N="36" REF="002481_0039_0FDB63E0E1830A60"/>Instrumental Musick, in Divine Worship. And in the <HI>mean</HI> time, pray be <HI>Easy;</HI> and assure your self, that Singing by <HI>Rule,</HI> won't in our Day, in∣troduce Instrumental Musick, much less Quaker∣ism and Popery. I promise you, your <HI>Usual</HI> way of Singing, would much sooner, dispose <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to full in with them. Because the <HI>Quakers</HI> don't Sing <HI>at all,</HI> and I should be out of the Noise of it; and the <HI>Papists</HI> Sing much better, when they Sing by Rule. I mean only as to the External part of the Service. But I speak in <HI>Jest,</HI> and to show you the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of this Objection.</P>
<P>But then as to the <HI>Baudiness</HI> of <HI>La, Sol;</HI> All I need say is, That <HI>as the Fool thinketh, so the Bell Clinketh.</HI> No Mortal that can spell would ever have had such a Tho't, and it's a shame to men∣tion it. And I'm sure, I'd never have done it, but to let the world see, what Treatment we have from you, who have <HI>a Zeal without Know∣ledge,</HI> as I must bear you Record.</P>

<P>And these Names have been retained ever since. Because they answer the End as well as
<PB N="37" REF="002481_0040_0FDB63E26215C8C8"/>any other. And <HI>some</HI> Names there must be for the Advantage of the <HI>Learner:</HI> But if any will use, A, B, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or, <HI>Bo-Ce-Di-Ga-lo-ma-ni,</HI> propo∣sed by <HI>Alsted,</HI> instead thereof, it will serve the turn. And so as to the Names of the Tunes. <HI>St. Mary's, Isle of Wight</HI>—they'r to distinguish one Tune from another, and one Name is us well as another for that End, Tho' it be <HI>isle of Shoals</HI> for <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> or <HI>Bullbead</HI> for <HI>Dunbred,</HI> as some in <HI>Derisien</HI> have call'd 'em. But then the Names must be such as People commonly <HI>agree</HI> to call them by, or it will breed the Confusion of <HI>Babel,</HI> where, when a Man called for a <HI>Trewel,</HI> his Ser∣vant brôt him a <HI>Spade</HI> or a <HI>Pick-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x.</HI> And why may not a Tune be called <HI>St. Mary's</HI> as well as <HI>St. David's,</HI> and so one of our most celebrated Tunes is termed in our Psalm Books; unless you think with one, that said to me, <HI>He did net know but that Tune was made by</HI> King <HI>David, about</HI> 200 <HI>Year ago.</HI> Commend me to that Man, how∣ever for a <HI>Chronologer,</HI> if he's no Musician!</P>
<P>And then, as to the <HI>Blasphemy</HI> of Fa, Sol, La, it's too <HI>foul-mouth'd</HI> an Objection to be repeated, and as hideous <HI>Nonsense</HI> as ever was utter'd: and therefore Good now, <HI>N.</HI> let's pass on to your 7th Objection, if you please.</P>

<P>N. Sir, <HI>It is this, That this way of Singing is</HI> Need∣less, <HI>since our</HI> Good Fathers, <HI>that knew not this way, are got to</HI> Heaven <HI>without it. And therefore what need of all this</HI> Adoo <HI>and</HI> Pudder <HI>for Nothing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> Why look'ee, <HI>N.</HI> as to the Good Fathers of <HI>some</HI> of you <HI>A. R. S's,</HI> I can't say, but that they were unacquainted with <HI>this</HI> Excellent way of Singing, and I can't say whether they could sing <HI>any way;</HI> nor can I tell, whether they did not leave the <HI>Old Land</HI> (as you sometimes call it) to steer clear of Singing by Rule, thô I hope they had more Wisdom. But this I know certainly and affirm constantly, that some of <HI>our</HI> Fathers, that were I suppose, pretty near as Good, as any of yours, were <HI>acquainted</HI> with this way of Sing∣ing <HI>My</HI> Father learnt it at <HI>College;</HI> and I can Sing a Tune he learnt me by Note when I was a <HI>Child;</HI> and I have now in my Study, Tunes prick'd with his own Hand, and I can't be more sure of any thing of that nature, than of <HI>this,</HI> That he highly <HI>approv'd</HI> of it, &amp; greatly delighted in it. And one Reason doubtless, why he did not <HI>practise</HI> it, was, because his <HI>People</HI> could not do so; and it's probable he (did, as another Mini∣ster famous in our Neighbour hood, I've been in∣form'd, has said he did) <HI>shuck in with the People, and sang himself out of all.</HI> And thô, (I am humbly thankful) I've as much reason as some others to <HI>reverence</HI> the Memory of my <HI>Ancestors,</HI>

<HI>Besides,</HI> to say it's needless to learn to Sing by Note, for the Reason you mention, is just as much sense, as the Man's saying, It was needless to learn to <HI>Read,</HI> because his <HI>Uncle,</HI> that could not read had as <HI>good Corn,</HI> as any Body in Town.

<P>N. <HI>Sir, my second set of Objections was against the</HI> Persons <HI>that are the</HI> Admirers, <HI>Promoters and Practitioners of this Way of Singing und r Consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ration. And my first particular</HI> —.</P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> Hold <HI>N!</HI> One word if you please, as we go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, to all Objections of this nature; which (it may be) may save you the labour of mentioning, and me of answering them particularly: And that is, That <HI>no</HI> Obj. of <HI>this</HI> kind can touch the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit</HI> of the Cause. For if so, are there not <HI>with you,</HI> even with you? as scandalous persons, per∣sons of as vile &amp; ignominious a Character, and guilty of as much folly &amp; iniquity as any in the Town —? Are there no <HI>A. R. S</HI>'s that are Tip∣lers, Tavern-haunters, Idle, Sauntering Drones, and meer Incendiaries—? But tho' we com∣mend all that are for Regular Singing, on <HI>that ac∣count;</HI> we are very far from commending any thing <HI>victous</HI> or of Bad Report in them. And we pray, that what you see amiss in any of <HI>Us,</HI> you'd <HI>mend</HI> in your <HI>selves.</HI> And consider, are there no scandalous <HI>N.Consormisis?</HI> Are there no Hypo∣pocrites in the <HI>true</HI> Church? And will you then <HI>Condemn</HI> the True Church, and give up the cause of N. Conformity for that Reason? Do you dis∣like the <HI>good Fish,</HI> you take in the Net, because there are some <HI>and,</HI> slide in among them? Should the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Christ, reject the Gospel, because by the Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of it, some are bro't into the
<PB N="42" REF="002481_0045_0FDB63EF11CC3A88"/>Church, that prove a <HI>Pest</HI> in it; and when they come to discover their Hypocrisy &amp; Unsoundness, they wish <HI>them</HI> out again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> On the other side, Are there not some, are there not many yea are not the principal <HI>Encouragers</HI> of Regular Singing, such as you ought to Esteem <HI>Faithful Servants</HI> of Jesus Christ? And such as are more <HI>Proper Judges</HI> in this matter than <HI>any</HI> of you? And mayn't you with more Reason, argue thus, There are these and those, Men of <HI>Learning &amp; Wisdom &amp; Piety, for</HI> Singing by Rule, and therefore we dare say no∣thing <HI>against</HI> it? Does not the argument hold this way, at least as well as the other.</P>
<P>You take my M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <HI>N.</HI> I presume; and if you see meet, yet, to mention your <HI>Particulars,</HI> pray do so, and don't say <HI>you can't be heard.</HI> Only, bring 'em all out together, for there's <HI>ne'r a Bar∣rel the Better Herring;</HI> and the time wou'd fail to enlarge on 'em all.</P>
<P>N. <HI>Sir, You'l gratify me to say a few words to each, that I may however, know Low to answer such as Reproach you on the account of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>M.</HI> 'Tis well, <HI>N.</HI> please to say on.</P>
<P>N. <HI>Sir, It's sand</HI> (1) <HI>That the bringing up of this way is a Contrivance to</HI> got Money. (2) <HI>That there</HI>'s too much time <HI>sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt in learning. That People</HI> Tar∣ry out <HI>Disorderly, and Fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly-Religion is</HI> neg∣lected. (3) <HI>That they'r a Company of</HI> Young Up∣starts <HI>that fall in with this way, and set it for ward, and some of them are</HI> Lord &amp; Loose <HI>Persons and guilty of Prophetness in Singing I s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lm Tunes in</HI> Barns <HI>and at</HI> Plow &amp; Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>will make nothing to

<P><HI>M.</HI> Now take an answer <HI>N.</HI>—As to getting <HI>Money</HI> by it; This were a <HI>Better</HI> Contrivance (allowing the Objection) and more justifyable, than many <HI>approved</HI> of, by some that Object this. And why the <HI>Singing Master,</HI> is not worthy of his Reward for his pains in teaching our Children to <HI>Sing,</HI> as well as the <HI>School Dame</HI> and School <HI>Master</HI> for Teaching our Children to <HI>Read,</HI> Write &amp; Cypher, I can't Devise. For, <HI>Musick</HI> is as Real &amp; Lawful &amp; Ingenious an <HI>Art,</HI> as either of the other. I don't say indeed as <HI>Useful &amp; Ne∣cessary.</HI> But to put you, in this place, out of pain about your <HI>Purses;</HI> I'll undertake, if you'll learn to Sing, you shall all be taught on <HI>free</HI> Cost.</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> as to spending too much <HI>Time,</HI> or neglect∣ing <HI>Family Religion,</HI> (if there be any ground for such an Objection) we'r very <HI>sorry</HI> for it. I'll <HI>countenance</HI> no such things. But I won't there∣fore condem the <HI>Practice,</HI> and <HI>discourage</HI> any from learning to Sing; but will Exhort them to <HI>reform</HI> such things, and <HI>cut off occasion,</HI> from such as seek it, <HI>to speak evil of the things they understand not.</HI> For my own part, as Iv'e the Honour of Conduct∣ing this Flock of <HI>Christ,</HI> I shall recommend it to <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Families,</HI> that, when they go out in an <HI>Evening</HI> to Sing, they'd set their Houses in order <HI>before</HI> they go from Home. And as for <HI>being out late,</HI> it can't well be <HI>avoided,</HI> where People go so <HI>far,</HI> as some must do; and I wish <HI>some</HI> that <HI>make the Objection</HI> (thô <HI>this</HI> I confess is only.
<PB N="44" REF="002481_0047_0FDB63F15C27CB50"/><HI>Argumentum ad Hominem</HI>) did not drive a Trade of tarrying out unseasonably, on <HI>less</HI> Justifyable Occasions.</P>
<P><HI>And,</HI> as to Singing in <HI>Barns</HI> and <HI>Fields</HI>— you may see the Objection answered in the <HI>Trea∣tise,</HI> I've so often refer'd too. And tho' there may possibly be some <HI>Deference</HI> to be paid to Common <HI>Psalm-Tunes;</HI> yet it's wonderful to hear <HI>those</HI> talk at this rate, that deny the <HI>Holiness of Places.</HI> For surely the <HI>Meeting-House</HI> is as Holy as any <HI>Tune.</HI> Is the <HI>One</HI> improv'd in the <HI>Worship</HI> of GOD? so is the <HI>other.</HI> But this Objection arises from a <HI>Su∣perstitious</HI> Notion, some have Imbib'd, That there is some <HI>Sacredness in Tunes.</HI> But I assure you, &amp; can easily demonstrate to you, there is not the <HI>least Jot.</HI> If any would suppose there's a <HI>Relative Ho∣liness</HI> in some Psalm-Tunes, I affirm, there is no more <HI>Real Holiness</HI> in the most Celebrated Psalm Tune, than in the <HI>Tune of, Pepper is Black.</HI> And if People have taken up any other notion, It's <HI>high time</HI> they should be better inform'd, and convicted of their Error. <HI>Psalm</HI>-Tunes &amp; <HI>Song</HI>-Tunes are <HI>all</HI> made by the <HI>same</HI> Rule: and those that <HI>made</HI> the Psalm-Tunes were not Divinely <HI>inspir'd;</HI> nor had they <HI>Authority</HI> to <HI>consecrate</HI> any Tune to the wor∣ship of GOD. I remember, as I was talking with one good Man on this Head, he cry'd out, <HI>I'm con∣vinc'd; for</HI> (said he) <HI>tho' the</HI> Bible <HI>is Holy, the</HI> Covers <HI>are not so.</HI>—And further I affirm, the <HI>most</HI> of the <HI>Psalm-Tunes,</HI> as Sung in the <HI>Usual way,</HI> are much more like <HI>Song</HI>-Tunes, than as Sung by <HI>Rule;</HI> because you've more <HI>Supernumerary</HI> Notes &amp; Turnings
<PB N="45" REF="002481_0048_0FDB63F4F830DB70"/>of the voice in your way, than in ours. An In∣genious Gentleman, who has prick'd <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as some of <HI>you</HI> Sing it, finds (as I remember) no less than 150 Notes, in that Tune, in <HI>your</HI> way, whereas in our's, there are but 30. Did we pro∣pose so many <HI>Crotchets,</HI> and <HI>Quavers,</HI> and <HI>Semi</HI>-quavers and <HI>Demi</HI>-semi-quavers, in every Tune, I should not wonder if you were <HI>discouraged</HI> from endeavouring to learn to Sing. But alas! <HI>This</HI> is what you've generally <HI>no Notion</HI> about: And yet think your selves sufficiently <HI>accomplish'd</HI> to judge in the Affair—. Yea some <HI>Rage</HI> again in their Confidence. And yet sometimes <HI>their own Mouths condemn</HI> them. I was told by a very <HI>worthy Man,</HI> That he was not long since arguing with one of your <HI>Fraternity,</HI> and at length us'd this <HI>Similitude,—You are a</HI> Planter <HI>Ner'beur.</HI> Now suppose, while you'r Planting, there comes a <HI>Sailer</HI> athwart you. <HI>Well!</HI> crys he; <HI>What are you doing,</HI> Friend?— A doing (say you)?

<Q>It would be very de∣sirable, that People (and especially our <HI>Young People,</HI> who are most in the Years of <HI>Discip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> would more generally <HI>learn to Sing</HI> and become able to Sing by <HI>RULE,</HI> and keep to the Notes of the Tunes, which our Spiritual Songs are set unto; which would be to Sing as <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gen</HI> expres∣ses it, — <HI>Agreeably and Melodiously.</HI>—It has been found that in length of Time, in some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Congregations their Singing has degen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="48" REF="002481_0051_0FDB63F98D6D6C78"/>into an <HI>Odd Noise,</HI> that has more of what we want a name for, than any <HI>Regular Singing</HI> in it whereby the Celestial Exercise is Dishonoured; and indeed the Third Commandment is tres∣parsed on. To take notice of the <HI>Ridiculous Pleas,</HI> wherewith some very weak People go to confirm this Degeneracy, would indeed be to pay too much Respect unto them. And they must have strange notions of the Divine SPIRIT, and of his operations, who shall imagine, that the Delight which their <HI>untuned Ears</HI> take in an <HI>Uncouth Noise,</HI> more than in a <HI>Regular Sing∣ing,</HI> is any Communion with Him. The Skill of <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> is among the <HI>Gifts of GOD</HI> unto the Children of Men, and by no means unthankfully to be <HI>Neglected</HI> or <HI>Despised.</HI> For the <HI>Congregations,</HI> wherein 'tis wanting to re∣cover a <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> would be really a <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> and a Recovery out of an <HI>Apostacy,</HI> and what we may judge that <HI>Heaven</HI> would be <HI>pleased</HI> withal. We ought certainly to serve our GOD with our <HI>Best:</HI> and Regular Singing must needs be <HI>better</HI> than the <HI>Confused Noise</HI> of a Wilderness. GOD is not for <HI>Confusion in the Churches of the Saints;</HI> but requires, <HI>Let all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings be done Decently.</HI> — The Tunes com∣monly used in our Churches are <HI>Few;</HI> 'Twere well if there were <HI>more</HI>—. It is to be desired, that we may see in the <HI>Rising General on,</HI> a fresh and strong Disposition to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the proper Tunes; that GOD may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Religion Beau∣tify'd, with a <HI>Regu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> among us</Q>—
<PB N="49" REF="002481_0052_0FDB63FED86FC878"/>Now I should have tho't that by Two <HI>such Emi∣nent Witnesses,</HI> the Cause of <HI>Regular Singing</HI> might have been Establish'd. But tho' I lent this Book to some, and gave them the preceeding account; they regarded it not. After this, I shew'd them Mr. <HI>Walter</HI>'s Singing Book, recommended by <HI>Fifteen Ministers.</HI> They took as much notice of it, as if the famous <HI>Sam. Hide</HI> had commended it. <HI>Quis talia fando temperet a Lacrymis?</HI> Is this to Obey the voice of the Lord's Servants? To be∣lieve his Prophets? To learn the Law at the Mouths of Christ's Messengers? I have told you often, and now tell you even <HI>weeping,</HI>—'Tis a La∣mentation, and should be for a Lamentation! And especially that it should be so in a place so fa∣mous for Religion, as this has been!</P>
<P>But where now is that Mouth, that said, The <HI>Abettors</HI> of Regular Singing, were only <HI>Young Upstarts?</HI> The man one would think, should <HI>blush into a Flame,</HI> unless his Face is harder than a Rock, and he has eat shame and drank after it.</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> whereas you say, there are <HI>lewd and vici∣ous</HI> People that are pleased with this way: As I said before, Are there not <HI>as</HI> vicious Persons <HI>a∣gainst</HI> Regular Singing, as there can be <HI>for</HI> it? And if there are any <HI>Good</HI> People <HI>against</HI> it, It's more than I <HI>know,</HI> tho' I <HI>suppose</HI> some of them, are <HI>Faithful Brethren;</HI> but I'm Confident <HI>this</HI> is none of their Wisdom and Goodness, but their Weakness and Carnality; and if they <HI>die Mar∣tyrs</HI> in this Cause, as some have boasted they would, I dare assure them, they'l never obtain the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own</HI> of Martyrdom for their pains.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="002481_0053_0FDB64005294ED70"/>
<HI>In</HI> a word, It's utterly <HI>unfair</HI> to Charge the <HI>faults</HI> of all the <HI>Pretenders</HI> to this or that way, on the <HI>way it self.</HI> Are we willing a Judgment of <HI>N. Conformity</HI> should be made, from the Prin∣ciples or Lives of <HI>some</HI> N. Conformists? No verily! Therefore, Good now <HI>Nei'bour,</HI> let's hear no more such Objections, and come to your Last. Bring on your FORLORN-Hope! And <HI>if w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'ve stood the shower, I hope we shan't flinch for the Drops,</HI> of this Puny Objection. You know my Refe∣rence!</P>
<P>N. Sir, <HI>I'm willing to do so; for I think you've</HI> sufficiently answered <HI>all the former; and for my part, if you can answer this as fully, I'll give up the Cause; let who will be against</HI> Regular Singing, <HI>I'll have done, and come over to your side.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, <HI>My</HI> last <HI>Objection was against</HI> the way of bringing Regular Singing into practice in our Church. <HI>Some have said, they had nothing against</HI> Regular Singing, <HI>but they dislike the</HI> way <HI>of bring∣ing it</HI> in; <HI>they account it's</HI> intruded <HI>upon them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Min.</HI> If you'd allow me one <HI>Random</HI>-Guess; I suppose it's 20 to one, but it had been bro't in <HI>right,</HI> if some of those <HI>Objectors,</HI> (who can't Sing, no not the <HI>Six Excellent Tunes</HI> aforesaid, if it were to save their Lives;) and some of their Queer <HI>Comrades,</HI> had been <HI>consulted,</HI> and leading in it. But some Men think nothing <HI>well done,</HI> that they han't a <HI>Hand,</HI> a <HI>Chief</HI> Hand, in the management of. If they think themselves <HI>neg∣lected,</HI> all the <HI>Fat's in the Fire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> And they'l set the whole Course of Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a Flame!—But
<PB N="51" REF="002481_0054_0FDB64029C73D428"/>you may Remember, <HI>N.</HI> (if <HI>you</HI> don't, <HI>I</HI> do) that I've publickly Declared, That as to <HI>this,</HI> I'm answerable for it. And I aver, it has been <HI>fairly</HI> and <HI>Regularly</HI> introduc'd; and I shan't be determined by those, that <HI>understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm,</HI> In this matter: And if any will be so <HI>Hardy</HI> as to Arraign my Administrations on this Score, I <HI>appeal to Council.</HI> And I'm still of the same mind. And if any will still <HI>go on</HI> to Censure me on this Score, and yet <HI>decline</HI> the proposed Method: or, if any in other places will do so, upon Hearsays, <HI>The Lord Judge between me and them! And the Good Lord forgive them, who know not what they do!</HI> And for further Answer (tho' I han't time now to go thro' the Story of it's Introduction) I'll hint to you a few things. <HI>First,</HI> I don't understand your Notion of <HI>Intrusion.</HI> Men intrude on a Society, if they de∣prive them of their unquestionable Privileges, and oblige them to any thing unwarrantable and unreasonable—But who, ever before, complain'd of being intruded on, for being urged by their Pastor to the Practice of that which is <HI>Laudable</HI> and vertuous, and which they account so.</P>
<P><HI>Besides,</HI> You may think possibly, it should have been introduced by a <HI>Vote of the Church.</HI> But here you <HI>Blunder</HI> most miserably, and are <HI>igno∣rant</HI> of your own <HI>Principles.</HI> For your <HI>Platform</HI> of Discipline, which when it <HI>suits your Turn;</HI> (and I speak soberly, <HI>never else</HI> that I find) you'r very fond of, tells you in Terms, <HI>Chap.</HI> 10. <HI>Sect.</HI> 5.
<Q><HI>That the Power granted by Christ to the</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="002481_0055_0FDB640720635DD8"/>Body <HI>of the Church and</HI> Brotherhood <HI>is a Privi∣lege, which the Church doth Exercise, (1.) In Choosing their own Officers, whether Eiders or Deacons: (2.) In admission of Members.</HI></Q>— But not a word about matters of <HI>Doctrine</HI> or <HI>Worship.</HI> Here, the Pastor is <HI>Master</HI> of the Assembly, and unless he Preach <HI>false Doctrine,</HI> or introduce any <HI>part,</HI> or <HI>means</HI> of <HI>Worship,</HI> not <HI>warranted</HI> by the Word of God; he's <HI>Justifiable</HI> before all the World by <HI>your own</HI> Principles.</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> further, Some plead the matter should be decided, by a Vote of the <HI>Congregation:</HI> And (tho' there's neither <HI>Precept</HI> nor <HI>Precedent</HI> for such a thing, that I know of) <HI>this</HI> seems <HI>more</HI> Reasonable than the <HI>former.</HI> For <HI>every one</HI> in the Congregation has as much Liberty to Sing, as the <HI>Oldest Deacon</HI> in the Church, and as good a Right to decide this Question. For, there are many <HI>N. Communicants</HI> of you Anti-Regular-Singers, that know ten times as much about Sing∣ing, and can Sing ten times as well, as any of those of you that are <HI>Communicants.</HI> And since you'r as much divided about the <HI>Persons,</HI> who you suppose have a <HI>Right</HI> to vote in this Affair, as the <HI>Papists,</HI> about the Subject of <HI>Infallibility,</HI> (for, some of them, say, it's in the <HI>Pope</HI> alone: others, that it is in an Aecceminical <HI>Council;</HI> o∣thers, think it's in <HI>Beth</HI> together, and in neither seperate; and we <HI>Protestants</HI> justly say, it's in <HI>none</HI> of them) till you'r <HI>agreed,</HI> who are to de∣cide the matter by a Vote, it must e'n go Unde∣termined in any <HI>such</HI> way.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="002481_0056_0FDB64089514F130"/>
<HI>But</HI> then further I affirm, that the Care (at least) of <HI>Setting</HI> the Tune, does properly belong to the <HI>Pastor;</HI> and supposing he's tolerably <HI>skilled</HI> in Singing, it appertains to him to <HI>set it.</HI> I'm sure, in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, the <HI>Levites</HI> were <HI>over the Song,</HI> 1 Chron. 6.31<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ch. 15.19, 22. 2 Chr. 5.12. ch. 7.6. &amp; 30.21. And I see no Reason why <HI>Ministers</HI> should not be over it <HI>now,</HI> especially, when they are Skilful. I'm sure I know no such <HI>Ecclesiastical Officer</HI> of Divine Appointment, as a <HI>Quiris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</HI> As for the <HI>Deacons,</HI> the Business as∣sign'd 'em by the word of GOD, is to <HI>serve Tables,</HI> and not to Tune the Psalm. And I'm humbly of opinion, that the Reason why our <HI>New-England Pastors</HI> han't generally done this Service for the Church, but put it on the Deacons, has been either because they <HI>could not Sing,</HI> or because they would <HI>free</HI> themselves of the <HI>Trouble.</HI> And no doubt, if a Minister can't set the Tune, or it be burdensome to him; he may <HI>direct one to do it;</HI> who is most capable and best skill'd. <HI>For as every man has received the Gist, so let him minister the same,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.10. But such are much <HI>deceiv'd,</HI> who think a Minister <HI>takes too much upon him,</HI> that sets the Tune himself; especially, if he can Sing as well as any of his People, or if he can't, yet <HI>Calls upon</HI> whom he <HI>sees best</HI> to do it. The <HI>Mas∣ter</HI> of a Family, will set the Tune himself if he can: and if he can't, and any of his <HI>Children</HI> or <HI>Servants</HI> can do it a great deal better, I think he's a <HI>Proud</HI> Man, that scorns to <HI>put them</HI> upon it; and to be <HI>guided by them</HI> in this Exercise and part of Family-Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="002481_0057_0FDB13BA5B58BF68"/>
And then, <HI>in our way,</HI> when a Person has been p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d upon to set the Tune, it has ever been l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> his Dise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, <HI>what Tune</HI> to set, and <HI>How.</HI> And agr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when Deacon <HI>Tenny</HI> (of Blessed Memory) set the Tune in our Congregation, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Tune of the 119 Psalm, <HI>when,</HI> (there are yet Living Witnesses that can well remember) there was but <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four</HI> Men in the Town could Sing it. And yet none ever grumbl'd a∣gainst <HI>him</HI> for it, that I can learn. And when I set the Tune in <HI>mother</HI> Place, I bro't in a Tune to the 24th Psalm, which is said to be an <HI>Indian</HI> Tune, when but about 10 or 12 Men, were <HI>Mas∣ters</HI> of it, as I remember, when we sung it first. But none called my doing so <HI>Intrusion,</HI> but all were <HI>pleas'd</HI> with it, so far as I know. And there's the <HI>same</HI> Reason Now, not to say a great deal more, why, <HI>my</HI> setting the Tune, and now and then, <HI>one,</HI> not so commonly Sung, should be acceptable. For truly, I never took upon me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Tune here, till the Good old <HI>Deacon, yet a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive,</HI> had many Years ago, beg'd me to <HI>Excuse</HI> him, in Deacon <HI>Tenny's</HI> Absence—; and Elder <HI>Tenny</HI> had <HI>desired</HI> me again and again to do it; and a whole Room full of People, at my own House had done the like, the matter being pro∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed and Discoursed amongst them, and all ac∣quiesc'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so far as I perceiv'd (I profess I can't conceive why they should not) and Finally, I confess, I took one <HI>wrong step;</HI> condescending to <HI>propose</HI> to the <HI>Brethren</HI> as I did, whether it would be grateful to them, that I should for the
<PB N="55" REF="002481_0058_0FDB640A149535F8"/>future Tune the Psalm, acquainting them with Elder <HI>Tenny's</HI> Desire, and what Discourse had pass'd at my own House. Upon making which Proposal, a Principal Brother of our Church, (after a little Pause) said, <HI>Sir, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you'll take the</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ble <HI>of setting the Tune, to be sure it will be</HI> grate∣full <HI>to us.</HI> And no Man saying the least word to the contrary, I took their silence for Consent (as I do in a multitude of other cases) and thence∣forth have set the Tune. And for several Months I set only the usual Tunes, and in the <HI>way</HI> I was ever wont to set them; and continued to do so till I was told to my Head (by some I shan't name) that I set the Tune by <HI>Rule</HI>—. And indeed, when I see People so <HI>unreasonable,</HI> and would be <HI>angry</HI> with me for Singing by Rule (as they supposed) I at length <HI>resolved</HI> never to set a Tune again, <HI>any other</HI> way than by <HI>Note.</HI> And have govern'd my self accordingly, and intend to do so. And further I receiv'd a Letter from the Reverend &amp; Aged Mr. <HI>Wise</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch,</HI> wherein he gave it, as <HI>His Judgment,</HI> That <HI>when there were a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣number in a Congregation, to carry away a Tune Roundly, it was then proper to intr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duce that Tune:</HI> Which Letter I rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Church; and I never yet set any Tune Publickly, but there were (as I said before) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to carry the Tune, without the least hazard of making a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>er.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And</HI> now after all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.

<P><HI>Thus Net'bour,</HI> I've endured the <HI>Fatigue</HI> of Hearing and Answering your <HI>Objections.</HI> I might say abundance more in my own Vindication, but I will rather still <HI>seek unto God,</HI> and <HI>Commit my Cause to him,</HI> who sits in the Throne Judging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght.
