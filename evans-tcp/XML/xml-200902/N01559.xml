</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Penman of this Gospel was <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Zebedee,</HI> one of the Twelve Apostles: he was a Person so highly favoured by CHRIST, that he is in Scrip∣ture call'd, <HI>The Disciple whom JESUS Loved.</HI> We are told that he lived the lon∣gest of all the Twelve Apostles. It is observed that he insists more on the proof of CHRIST's Divinity, then any of the Evengelists, and some tell us that he wrote this Gospel in opposition to the Heresies of <HI>Ebion</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who de∣nied
<PB N="2" REF="001853_0003_0FB91C93D69BD398"/>CHRISTS Divinity. Very fitly is the Eagle made his Emblem: So high did he soar in his Discourses upon the Divinity of our Saviour, so steadily did He behold <HI>the Sun of Righteousness</HI> in His Brightness and Glory. He relates several re∣markable Passages which the other Evangelists had omitted, one of which, and that a very signal one, we have in this Chapter; wherein we have the History of that Illustrious Miracle <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Saviour wrought in raising <HI>Lazarus</HI> from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. A History this is, which considered in all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>'s Circumstances, will appear to be very Wonderful and Instructive; very Entertaining, and full of Con∣solation. In the History we may Observe. (1.) <HI>Lazarus was Sick.</HI> He was one whom JESUS Loved, and yet was Sick. Good Men that are dear to CHRIST, his Friends and Favourites, have been in all Ages Afflicted with the Infirmities and Sick∣nesses, which Humane Nature is subject to in this Frail Mortal State. So that Love or Hatred can't be known by such Afflictive Dispensations of Pro∣vidence. (2.) His Sisters <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Martha</HI> send to their LORD <HI>to acquaint Him with their Brothers illness.</HI> Observe here their Care and Concern for their Sick Brother. They send to the great Phy∣sician both of Soul and Body, in his behalf. Let us be very ready to do all the good and kind Offices we can for our Sick Friends and Relations. We should be ready to send for the Physician: And above all, we should send up our fervent Petitions to CHRIST upon the account of our Sick Friends, and Pray to Him, without whom all Physicians are of no value, to send forth His Word and heal them. What is a Brother, or a Sister, if not born for such a day of Adversity? (3.) We have an account of <HI>the Journey CHRIST
<PB N="3" REF="001853_0004_0FB91C9556A5A350"/>made</HI> to visit the Relations of His diseased Friend <HI>Lazarus;</HI> and of the notice He gave to His Dis∣ciples of his <HI>Death,</HI> which He at first call'd a <HI>Sleep.</HI> The Death of GOD's People is like Sleep after painful Labour. When they lay down their Heads in the Grave, they rest as in Beds, till the Resurrection, and will then awake wonderfully re∣freshed. (4.) We may take Notice of <HI>Martha</HI>'s <HI>going to, and meeting with JESUS;</HI> and of the Dis∣course they had together. <HI>Martha</HI> Expostulates with our Saviour concerning His <HI>Delay,</HI> in something a complaiming manner, and yet professeth her Faith in CHRIST's <HI>Power,</HI> and her belief of the <HI>Resur∣rection.</HI> Our Saviour in answer to her Confession of Faith respecting the Resurrection; doth declare that <HI>He is the Resurrection and the Life.</HI> (5.) We may take Notice of the tender <HI>Sympathy CHRIST had</HI> with his Mourning and Distressed Friends. It's said, <HI>JESUS Wept.</HI> CHRIST did truly partake of Humane Nature, and was made like unto us, Sin excepted. In the Afflictions of His People He was Afflicted. Their Sorrows and Sufferings made a painful Impression on His Spirit. Here we see that He was touch'd with a feeling of the Infirmities and Sorrows of those Mourners. Let us take care that the same mind may be in us, which was also in CHRIST JESUS. And in particular, when we go to the Houses of Mour∣ning, Let us do it with a becoming Solemnity; let us Mourn with them that Mourn, and labour to have a suitable Compassion for our Friends. (6.) We may take Notice of the Wonderful <HI>Miracle</HI> our Saviour wrought in raising <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Dead. By this Miracle upon a Body that had been Dead Four days, our Saviour gave an undeniable Testimony to the Truth which is laid
<PB N="4" REF="001853_0005_0FB91C96D6A6DFB8"/>down in our Text, now to be considered. JESUS saith unto her, <HI>I am the Resurrection, and the Life.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not alter the Words; but propound them as they lie in the Text.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST is the Resurrection, and the Life.</Q>
<P>THESE Expressions, <HI>The Resurrection and the Life,</HI> Are, in some respects, of the same importance, and do intend one and the same thing. However we may give each of them a distinct Consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is the RESUR∣RECTION.</HI> Now when it's said that CHRIST is the Resurrection, we may understand this to be the principal meaning of the Expression; <HI>viz.</HI> That the LORD JESUS CHRIST is the Author and Efficient cause of the Resurrection. The Bo∣dies of Men will be raised out of their Graves by the Almighty Power of CHRIST. Man con∣sists of Two Parts, a Soul, which is a Spiritual, Indivisible, Immortal Substance: And a Body, which was at first form'd out of the Dust, and must return to Dust again. When <HI>Adam</HI> had Sinned, GOD said unto him, Gen. 3.19. <HI>Dust thou art, and unto Dust thou shalt return.</HI> We all Sinned in him, and so must all taste of Death. Our Duss will in a little time <HI>return to the Earth as it was; and the Spirit to GOD, who gave it.</HI> These near and dear Companions, the Soul and Body must be separated: but they shall not al∣ways continue in this state of Seperation. No,
<PB N="5" REF="001853_0006_0FB91C9A970A4120"/>The Son of GOD will at the Last Day raise our Bodies out of their Graves, Commanding them to come forth, as when He said, <HI>Lazarus come forth.</HI> And the Voice of CHRIST when He shall say, <HI>Arise ye Dead,</HI> will be an Almighty Voice, such a Word of Power as spoke the World into Being at First. He will command the Earth and Sea to give up their Dead. He will gather the scattered Dust of the Dead Bodies of Men, and Fashion them a-new by His Power. He'l Com∣mand <HI>the dry bones to live.</HI> He will cause <HI>Breath</HI> to enter <HI>into them, and they shall live, and stand up an exceeding great Army:</HI> To allude to that, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.5, 10. CHRIST will in a literal sence open their Graves, and bring them out of their Graves, and they shall live. This the Scripture assures us, Joh. 5.28, 29. <HI>Marvel not at this: For the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Resurrection of Life; and they that have done evil unto the Resurrection of Damnation.</HI> This Great and Wonderful Work of Raising the Dead, belongs to CHRIST's Kingly Office. He is the LORD both of the Dead and Living. He hath the Keys of Death. And at the Last Day He will open the Graves, and Command the Dead, both the Bodies of the Saints, and of the Wicked, to arise. CHRIST will raise the Bodies of the <HI>Wicked</HI> by an act of So∣veraign Power and Dominion. But it's of the Re∣surrection of the <HI>Just</HI> which we shall speak Princi∣pally. Now it will still more Clearly appear that the LORD JESUS CHRIST is the Author, and Efficient of the Resurrection, with respect to His People, if we Consider.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="001853_0007_0FB91C9C17959900"/>
1. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST hath Purchased a Glorious and Happy Resurrection for His People.</HI> The Bodies of Men are by Sin expos'd to Ignominy and Disgrace. The Apostacy did not only destroy the Divine Beauty of the <HI>Soul</HI> which consisted chiefly in its Conformity to GOD <HI>in Righteousness and true Holiness;</HI> but also it defac'd the Beauty of the <HI>Body,</HI> and in a great measure mar'd it's Glory. The Bo∣dies of Men are become vile and ignoble, Compa∣ratively. Phil. 3.21. — <HI>Our vile Body</HI> — We may in this respect take up a Lamentation and say, <HI>The Crown is fallen from our heads; wo unto us that we have sinned.</HI> The whole Head is Sick; and the whole Heart faint. <HI>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness.</HI> No Man enjoys perfect Health. And how often are the Bodies of Men the Seat and Subject of loathsome Diseases; of Wounds and Bruises, and putrifying Sores; of great Weakness, and pining Sickness. And in a little time these Earthly Tabernacles must Moulder down, and be Dissolved. In a little time the Beauty and Glory that remains upon our Bodies will be laid in the Dust, and Darkness and the Shadow of Death will stain it. But the Son of GOD hath Purchas'd a Glorious Resurrection for His People. The LORD JESUS CHRIST appear'd upon Earth in the likeness of Sinful Flesh. <HI>And tho' He was in the form of GOD, and thought it not robbery to be equal with GOD;</HI> yet He <HI>took upon Him the form of a ser∣vant, became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross.</HI> Tho' He was the LORD of Life and Glory, yet He Voluntarily submitted to a shameful sor∣rowful Death. Now all this was, that the Saints might be Redeem'd from the power of the Grave: That the bands of Death might be loosed, and that they might be brought out of the Prison of the
<PB N="7" REF="001853_0008_0FB91C9E58768708"/>Grave. Zech. 9.11. <HI>By the Blood of thy Covenant I have sent forth thy Prisoners out of the Pit.</HI> By Dy∣ing, CHRIST destroy'd the power of Death. CHRIST Redeemed His People by Price; by His Active and Passive Obedience He Purchas'd this Glorious Resurrection for them, with all the Excel∣lent Endowments and Perfective Qualities of their Resurrection-Bodies. And in this respect CHRIST may be called the <HI>Meritorious</HI> cause of the Resurrecti∣on of the Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST Rose from the Dead, and so became the Exemplar and Pattern of the Resur∣rection, and the First-Fruits of them that slept.</HI> The Son of GOD Rose again from the Dead by His <HI>own Power,</HI> Joh. 10.18. <HI>I have power to lay it down</HI> [<HI>my Life</HI>]. <HI>and I have power to take it again.</HI> As He offer'd up Himself to GOD <HI>through the Eternal Spirit,</HI> i. e. His Eternal God-Head, His Divine Nature; so He arose again by the Almighty Power of the same Di∣vine Nature. CHRIST raised up the Temple of His Body by that Power which He hath in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit. <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.19. And then in the Resurrection of His Body, the Son of GOD hath given us the <HI>Pattern</HI> and <HI>Exemplar</HI> accor∣ding to which the Resurrection-Bodies of His People shall be Moulded and Fashioned. For their vile Bo∣dies shall be Changed and <HI>Fashioned like to CHRIST's Glorious Body.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, CHRIST by His Resurrection is be∣come the First-Fruits of them that slept. 1 Cor. 15.20. <HI>But now is CHRIST risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.</HI> As the First-Fruits being offer'd to GOD, under the Law, sanctified the whole, and were also an Earnest of the full Harvest:
<PB N="8" REF="001853_0009_0FB91CA2D7149D78"/>so in CHRIST's Resurrection, the People of GOD have an <HI>Earnest, Pledge,</HI> and <HI>Assurance</HI> of their <HI>own</HI> Re∣surrection to Glory and Immortality. Accordingly the Apostle argues in, 1 Cor. 15.12. <HI>Now if CHRIST be Preached that He rose from the Dead, how say some among you, that there is no Resurrection of the Dead?</HI> The Apostle speaks of it as a very absurd unrea∣sonable thing to deny the Resurrection of <HI>Believers,</HI> whenas there were such undeniable Proofs and Testimonies of CHRIST's being raised from the Dead. When our Saviour arose again, He brought forth Judgment unto Victory, and gave His Peo∣ple an evident Demonstration that He had conquer∣ed Death in their behalf. For He rose from the Dead as a Publick Person, the Head and Represen∣tative of all true Believers. They are the Mem∣bers of CHRIST; and CHRIST Mystical is not perfected till all the Saints are risen. So that in CHRIST's Resurrection Believers have an Assurance of their own Resurrection. When the Son of GOD, the Strong the Mighty Redeemer awoke out of Sleep, He took away the Gates of the Grave, and carried away the Bars of the Pit. And the Scrip∣ture informs us, <HI>that the Graves were then open'd, and many Bodies of Saints which slept, arose. And came out of the Graves after his Resurrection,</HI> Mat. 27.52, 53. This Miraculous Work was a Specimen of the General Resurrection; and a plain proof and In∣dication of the Infinite Vertue of CHRIST's Death and Resurrection.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST will at the Last Day, raise the Dead Bodies of the Saints by His Al∣mighty Power, as He is their Head and Redeemer.</HI> This will not be meerly an Act of His <HI>Common</HI> Sove∣raign Power, as He is Head over all things: But
<PB N="9" REF="001853_0010_0FB91CA516AE9848"/>also an Act of <HI>Grace and especial Favour,</HI> as He is their LORD Redeemer, and their Head. Vital powerful influences will flow from CHRIST as the Head of His body, the Church, unto His Members to quicken and raise their Dead Bodies, and to make them Incorruptible, Immortal, Glorious. This the Scripture doth abundantly declare; 1 Cor. 15.22, 45. <HI>For as in Adam all die, even so in CHRIST shall all be made alive. — The last Adam was made a quickning Spirit.</HI> Phil. 3.20, 21. <HI>For our Conversation is in Hea∣ven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the LORD JESUS CHRIST: who shall change our vile Body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.</HI> CHRIST will adorn the Bodies of the Saints with the like Excellent and Glorious Qualities, with which His own Body is Beautified and Dignified: Not the same in <HI>Degree,</HI> but as to <HI>Kind:</HI> CHRIST's Body will mightily Excel in Glory. Another Signal Testimony to the Resur∣rection we have in the Old Testament. Job. 19.23. to 27. inclusively. <HI>Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were Printed in a Book! That they were graven with an iron Pen and Lead, in the Rock for ever! For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter Day upon the Earth. And though after my skin, worms destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh shall I see GOD: whom I shall see for my self, and mine Eyes shall behold, and not another; though my Reins <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consumed within me.</HI> Observe here, with what an Au∣gust Speech he ushers in the Confession of his Faith, concerning the Resurrection. He would have this great, important Truth Written in a Book, or Engraven upon some Monument that should be durable like the Pillars of Heaven, that so it might be consecrated to Eternity, and handed down to the
<PB N="10" REF="001853_0011_0FB91CA6979CD878"/>latest Posterity, in Characters which Time should not be able to Efface. When Death, that great De∣vourer, whose Mouth is an open Sepulchre, hath done it's worst, destroyed not only the outward Parts, the Skin and Flesh; but also prey'd upon the more inward, vital Parts, the Reins; and brought Rot∣tenness into the Bones, and consumed the Marrow: Yet after all, the Son of GOD, that numbers the Hairs of our Heads, and knows all the Atoms that fly in the Air; that seeth into the dark Reces∣ses of the Grave, and hath them open and naked to His All-seeing Eye: He will preserve the scat∣tered Dust of His People and out of this very Dust, He will frame and fashion their Bodies, with cu∣rious and wonderful Art; with Infinite and Di∣vine Skill. But it is not my present Purpose, to Essay a Description of the Resurrection-Body in it's Beauty and Glory, Strength and Agility, Immortali∣ty and Incorruptibility; you may Read the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. <HI>Chap.</HI> at your Leisure. Only we may take No∣tice, that the Resurrection-Bodies of the Saints will not be meer <HI>Aethereal Vehicles,</HI> or of such a fine Substance as shall escape the Sight, and become Invisible; No, No; They will be proper <HI>Organical Bodies. Job</HI> says, <HI>that though worms destroy</HI> this <HI>Body, yet in</HI> My <HI>Flesh</HI> shall I see GOD, — <HI>And Mine Eyes shall behold,</HI> and not another. Unless we acknowlege this, we in effect destroy One Essential, Constituent Part of Man.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is LIFE.</HI> Now this Expression as we hinted before, may be look'd upon as of the same Import and Signification with the former, and as Exegetical of it. However, having considered the former Expression in a strict and pro∣per Sense, as it respects the Resurrection of the
<PB N="11" REF="001853_0012_0FB91CA816BC57D0"/>Body; we may speak something, very briefly, unto this, without interfering with what hath been already said.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CHRIST as GOD, is Life Essentially.</HI> He is the Living GOD. All Degrees of Life are contained in Him by way of Eminency. He possesseth a Full∣ness of Life and Being, Unchangibly and Everlast∣ingly; without any possibility of Decay, or the least approach toward a Dissolution. He is the Ever∣living JEHOVAH, the Eternal I AM. His Life is in and of Himself. There are no Seeds or Principles of Corruption in His Nature; and nothing from without, that can in any Measure disturb, much less destroy His Being. The Angels shall never Die; But then GOD gave them their Being at first, and they depend intirely upon Him for the Continuance of it: Did not He uphold them by putting His Ever∣lasting Arms underneath them, they would instant∣ly sink and retire into their first State of Not∣being. But CHRIST is altogether, and absolutely Independent upon any thing without Himself; both for Life and the Continuance of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>CHRIST is Life Causally and Virtually.</HI> CHRIST as GOD, is the Universal Principle and Spring of Life. He is the Fountain, from whence all Kinds of Life flow, and are derived. <HI>In Him we live, and move, and have our being.</HI> He made all Things, and upholdeth them all in Being. He is the first Cause of the Vegetative, Animal, and Rational Life. John 1, 3, 4. <HI>All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made. In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> The Son of GOD gave Life to every Living Creature; He form'd the Spirit of Man within him which is the Candle of the Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="001853_0013_0FB91CAA99E0AA10"/>
3. <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is He is GOD Man Mediator, the Saviour and Redeemer of His People, is their Life.</HI> And this seems to be principally intended in our Text. CHRIST is the Prince of Life. Joh. 14.6. <HI>JESUS saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth and the life: no Man cometh to the Father but by Me.</HI> Sin hath cut us off from GOD, as He is the Fountain of Spiritual Life. And it's in CHRIST alone that this Fountain is opened to such Sinners as we are. CHRIST Died that His People might Live; and He ever lives to Communicate Life to them. He who is the true and faithful Witness testifies of Him∣self, Rev. 1.18. <HI>I am He that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</HI> CHRIST is a Priest, <HI>Who is made not after the Law of a carnal Commandment, but after the power of an endless Life,</HI> Heb. 7.16. And He is able to Save them to the uttermost that come to GOD by Him, because <HI>He ever lives to make Inter∣cession for them.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) <HI>CHRIST createth the New Nature, and forms the Spiritual Life in His People.</HI> He makes those who were Dead in Trespasses and Sins, Alive to GOD, by forming the Divine Image in their Souls. He gives this Light of Life to His People, that sat in the Region and Shadow of Death. Every true Be∣liever hath a Spiritual Resurrection thro' CHRIST. Joh. 5.25. <HI>Verily, Verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the Dead shall hear the voice of the Son of GOD: And they that hear shall live.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) <HI>THROUGH CHRIST Believers who were Condemn'd to Die, receive the Justification of Life.</HI> Rom. 5.18. — The free Gist came upon all Men unto Justification of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001853_0014_0FB91CABD9C17D98"/>
(3) <HI>IT is through CHRIST that the Spiritual Life of GOD's People is maintained and increased, till it be per∣fected in Glory,</HI> Gal. 2.20. I am Crucified with CHRIST: Nevertheless I live; yet not I, but CHRIST liveth in me: And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me, and gave Himself for me. Believers receive those vital Influences from CHRIST whereby the New Man is kept alive, fed and non∣rish'd, till it be grown to the Stature of a perfect Man in CHRIST.</P>
<P>(4.) <HI>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST gives His People Everlasting Life.</HI> At the Great Day, Mortality shall be swallowed up of Life. Then CHRIST, who is the Life of His People, shall appear. Then will their Life be perfected for ever; and they shall enter upon the Heavenly Life, which shall never never have an end. John 10.28. <HI>And I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shall never Perish</HI> —</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE I. <HI>LEARN what grent Reason we have to Bless GOD, in that we have the Gospel, wherein CHRIST is Revealed and Offered to us.</HI> The Apostle says, that GOD Saved us, and Called us with an Holy Cal∣ling not according to our Works, but according to His own Purpose and Grace, which was given us in CHRIST JESUS, before the World began; but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour JESUS CHRIST, who hath Abolished Death, and hatl. brought Life and Immortality to light, through the Gospel, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9, 10. It's a great and unspeakable Favour to enjoy the Means
<PB N="14" REF="001853_0015_0FB91CAD5692F9F8"/>of obtaining an Interest in CHRIST; O let us take care to Prise and Improve them: And be Earnest with GOD to Enlighten our Minds, that we may come to know GOD and CHRIST, whom to know is Life Eternal. John 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which testifie of Me.</HI> It's a wonderful Mercy that such Sinful, Mortal, Dying Creatures as we are, should have the Discoveries of an Happy, and Glorious Resurrection made to us through CHRIST. The Lord grant that it may not be said of us, that we refuse to come to Him that we might have Life.</P>
<P>USE II. IS CHRIST the Resurrection and the Life; Learn hence, <HI>That it is our great Interest as well as Duty, to employ all the Powers and Facul∣ties of Soul and Body, in His Service.</HI> If we would hope to obtain an happy Resurrection, we must now Glorify GOD with our Souls and Bodies, which are His. It's our Interest to lay out our selves to the utmost in the Work and Service of CHRIST. We should very gladly spend and be spent for CHRIST; Yea, be ready to Sacrifice our very Lives for His sake, if His Glory calls for it for He will give all His Faithful Servants a much better Life than this we now enjoy. <HI>Be this faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Life,</HI> Rev. 2.10. Let us take care to make our Bodies Instruments of Righteousness unto Holiness. Let us improve these <HI>Earthen Vessels</HI> Diligently and Faithfully in Gods Service; and then CHRIST will One Day Refine them, and make them <HI>Vessels of Honour and Glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001853_0016_0FB91CAF9E9DB138"/>
USE III. <HI>THIS Consideration should make the Children of GOD Patient, Submissive, and Chearful, under all the Pains, Weakness, and Sickness, they suffer in this Frail, Mortal State.</HI> The Children of GOD are subject to the same Infirmities and Bodily Pains as others are. They may many times say, that they have no Soundness in their Flesh. Many times they may complain with the Psalmist, <HI>That they are weak, and their Bones are vexed,</HI> Psal. 6.2. O Believer, hast thou frequent Returns of Pain and Illness? Well, see that you quietly and pa∣tiently Resign up your self to the Soveraign Will of GOD. Do not Faint, or Fret, when thou art thus Rebuked of the LORD. Thy Redeemer is by these Afflictive Dispensations of Providence, preparing thee for an Happy Resurrection. And when they <HI>Corruptible</HI> shall have put on <HI>Incorruption,</HI> thou shalt never more complain of Sickness; but thy Health and Strength shall be perfected for ever. Rev. 21.4. <HI>And GOD shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there shall be no more Death, nei∣ther Sorrow nor Crying, neither shall there be any more Pain, for the former things are passed away.</HI></P>
<P>USE IV. <HI>THIS should support the People of GOD undo the near Approaches of their own Death.</HI> There is a close and very intimate Union between the Soul and Body, so that a Dissolution is dread∣ful to Nature. But the Children of God should labour to overcome this Reluctancy by Faith in CHRIST, and a firm Belief of the Resurrection. And Certainly, seeing their Redeemer is the Re∣surrection and the Life, they have no need to <HI>fear any Evil</HI> with Amazement; <HI>though they should walk though the valley of the shadow of Death.</HI> Do

Are the Infirmities of Age come upon you; <HI>Do the Keepers of the House tremble; Do the strong Men how themselves, and the Grinders cease because they are few; And are those that look out of the Windows darkened?</HI> Be not afraid, encourage your selves in the LORD JESUS CHRIST: Go out to meet the King of Terrors, leaning on your Beloved; Give all Diligence to make your Inte∣rest in CHRIST clear and evident to your Souls; Take your JESUS in the Arms of your Faith, and then with <HI>Simeon,</HI> Bless GOD, and say, <HI>Now lettest thou Thy servant depart in Peace, according to Thy Word. For mine Eyes have seen Thy Salvation,</HI> Luk. 2.29, 30.</P>

For if we Believe that JESUS died, and rose again; even so them also which sleep in JESUS, will GOD bring with Him.</HI> The Children of GOD when they Die, <HI>Sleep</HI> in JESUS; and in the Morning of the Resurrection, they shall <HI>Awake</HI> to Everlasting Life. <HI>Wherefore comfort one another with these Words.</HI></P>
<P>TO Conclude, O let us all Bless GOD for JESUS CHRIST; and see that we Receive Him who is the Resurrection and the Life. Let us Pray to GOD to help us to Believe, and Realize this great, mysterious Truth. O that it were written on our Hearts with the Finger of GOD! Let us Pray to GOD that we <HI>may be begotten again unto</HI>

In a Dying Hour, such an Hope well Bottomed is worth Ten Thousand Worlds. Let not the Amusements of this vain World, who's Fashion passeth away, hinder us from laying hold of this Hope which is now set before us through CHRIST. We are Mortal, Dy∣ing Creatures; <HI>our Life is a Vapour,</HI> and we know not what a Day may bring forth. Let us then to Day, while it is called to Day, make haste to CHRIST. Let us now take care to walk in New∣ness of Life; and then when we come to Die, we shall have Hope in our Death. And at the Great Day CHRIST will Call, and we shall Answer Him; He will Raise our Bodies out of the Dust, to Glory and Honour. This Corruptible, shall put on Incorruption, this Mortal shall put on Immor∣tality; Death shall be swallowed up in Victory, and we shall sing that Triumphant Song, 1 Cor. 15.55, 57. <HI>O Deat, where is thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory! Thanks be to GOD, which giveth us the Victory, through on</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
