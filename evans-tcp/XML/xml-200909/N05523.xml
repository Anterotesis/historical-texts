<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN the Examination of the Case, which is published at the Desire of some Gentle∣men that attended the Trial, the Reader will find, that in the Year 1749, Mr.</HI> Vassall <HI>seems to have taken a Resolution to be my Ruin; and to accomplish this</HI> vile and wicked End <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have made it his Practice</HI> for above two Years following, <HI>to say</HI> in all Companies <HI>such Things of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as had a direct Tendency to blast my Character and Reputation, and is destroy my Trade and Business, without having</HI> even the Shadow of Truth <HI>to support what he said, or</HI> any other <HI>Provocation th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n my</HI> censuring his Conduct <HI>in delivering to</HI> one Andrew Hall <HI>a promissary Note of considerable Value, which be the said</HI> Vassall <HI>ought to have delivered to me,</HI> as plainly appears by the Rule of Court in that Case annex'd hereto, and by doing of which I was wrong'd of the same, <HI>besides being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in the Law with the said</HI> Hall <HI>for above</HI> three Years <HI>on Account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereof. — It will also appear that Mr.</HI> Vassall <HI>could have us other Drift i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> summoning these Evidences which he did, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> to try to fish out <HI>how much I was, or had been in Debt, and with what Honour I had dealt; how far his End was answered, or what Effect it could have had in this Case, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I been four Times as much in Debt as I was, the Reader will judge. Every Gentleman in Business kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws, that a Mer∣chant of extensive Trade must of Necessary be in Debt. The Question is not, how much he is in Debt? but, with what Honour does be deal? for the more extensive his Trade is, and the more he is in Debt, the greater Damage is it to him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his good Name taken away; as is very elligantly set forth in the following Paragraph taken from the</HI> SPECTATOR, <HI>Vol. 3.</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 118.</P>
<Q><P>The most unhappy of all Men, and the most exposed to the Malignity or Wan∣tonness of the common Voice, is the Trader. Credit is undone in Whispers. The Tradesman's Wound is received from one who is more private and more cruel than the Ruffian with the Lanthorn and Dagger. The manner of repeating a Man's Name, <HI>As Mr.</HI> Cash, <HI>Oh! do you leave your Money at his Shop? Why do you know Mr.</HI> Searoom? <HI>He is indeed a general Merchant.</HI> I say, I have seen, from the Iteration of a Man's Name, hiding one Thought of him, and explaining what you hide, by saying something to his Advantage when you speak, a Merchant hurt in his Credit; and him who every Day he lived, literally added to the Value of his native Country, undone by one who was only a <HI>Burthen and a Blemish to it.</HI> Since every Body who knows the World is sensible of this great Evil, how careful ought a Man to be in his Language of a Merchant? It may possibly be in the Power of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Creature</HI> to lay the Ruin of the best Family in the most opulent City; and the more so, the more highly he deserves of his Country; that is to say, the farther he places his We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> out of his Hands, to draw home that of another Climate.</P>
<P><PB REF="007001_0003_102AE0F9E3C4CCA0"/>
In this Case an ill Word may change Plenty into Want, and by a rash Sentence a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and generous Fortune may in a few Days be reduced to Beggary. How lit∣tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> imagine, that an idle Phrase to the Disfavour of a Mer∣chant, may be as pernicious in the Consequence, as the Forgery of a Deed to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> would be to a Gentleman? Land stands where it did before a Gen∣tleman was calumniated, and the State of a great Action is just as it was before Calumny was offered to diminish it, and there is Time, Place and Occasion, ex∣pected to unravel all that is contrived against those Characters; but the Trader who is ready only for probable Demands upon him, can have no Armour against the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> the <HI>Malici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> and the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itus,</HI> who are prepared to fill the Cry to his Dishonour. Fire and Sword are slow Engines of Destruction, in Comparison of the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in the Case of the Merchant.</P>
<P>For this Reason, I thought it an imitable Piece of Humanity of a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who had great Variety of Affairs, and used to talk with Warmth enough against Gentlemen by whom he thought himself ill dealt with; that he would never let any thing be urged against a Merchant (with whom he had any Difference) except in a Court of Justice. He used to say, that to speak ill of a Merchant, was to begin his Suit with Judgment and Execution. One cannot, I think, say more on this Occasion, than to repeat, That the Merit of the Merchant is above that of all other Subjects; for while he is untouched in his Credit, his Hand∣writing is a more portable Coin for the Service of his Fellow-Citizens, and his Word the Gold of <HI>Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> in the Country wherein he resides.</P></Q>

<P>I <HI>Jonathan Mayhew</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> in the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> Clerk, do Testify and Declare, That being at the House of Mr. <HI>William Vassall</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI> aforesaid, the Defendant, (which was to the best of my Remembrance in the Year 1749) the said Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> said diverse Things concerning the Character and Conduct of Mr. <HI>William Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> Merchant, who was then lately gone to <HI>Europe;</HI> particularly the said Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> said, that the said Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> had sent one of his own Brothers to Sea in an old rotten, leaky, or condemn'd Vessel or Ship, with an Intention that she should be cast away or lost; whereupon one present intimating his Doubt concerning the Truth of this Fact, and speaking something in Favour of said Mr. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> the said Mr. <HI>Vas∣sall</HI> declared that said <HI>Fletcher</HI> never did a generous Thing or Action in his Life; and that if said <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s own Father, and every Relation he had in the World, had been on board the said Vessel or Ship he would not have scrupled to cast her away; provided he could have gotten any Thing thereby; the said Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> did at this Time further declare, what was the said Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s End and Design in casting the said Vessel away, which to the best of my Remembrance was this, that said Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> might get his Brother's (the Master's) Share of some Money that was likely to come to his Father's Heirs, or the Family: When the Things above-mentioned were spoken there were about six or seven Persons present. I do moreover testify and declare, that being <HI>another Time</HI> afterwards at the House of Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI>'s abovesaid, he again took Occasion to speak concerning the said Mr. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> and there being at this Time a Report newly come to <HI>Boston</HI> to this Purport, That said <HI>Fletcher</HI> was like to get little or nothing of the Prize-Money, after which he was supposed to be then gone to <HI>England,</HI> the said Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> declared, that he hoped or wished with all his Heart that this might be true; nevertheless the said Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> did immediately add, that he hoped said Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> would get enough to pay his Debts, and that if he did so, this must be a very large Sum, because the said <HI>Fletcher</HI> when he went away was not able to pay his Debts, and that he ow'd more than he was worth, that he was not worth a Groat, or that he was Thousands worse than Nothing; however said Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> did at the same Time express some Compassion to said Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Wife and Children, and said that he should be sorry if they were reduced to Want and Suffering, but that he should be glad to see said <HI>Fletcher</HI> himself a Beggar, nothing being too bad for such a Man; when these Things here mention'd were spoken, there was at least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Person present besides said Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> and my self.

<P><HI>N.

C. J. <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> whose Opinion in Actions of Slander seem'd to bear hard against the Defendant, <HI>was not spar'd by him.</HI></NOTE> which was of no Service to him or his Client, neither had he <HI>the least Colour of Evidence</HI> to support him in it. —</P>
<P>Saturday and Monday A. M. was taken up in re-examining some of the Witnesses, and in hearing what the <HI>Parties</HI> had to say:—Mr. <HI>Vassall began,</HI> when he acquainted the Court that what he had to say in Vindication of his Conduct, <HI>he had committed to Writing at his leisure Hours, that he might not say any Thing rashly,</HI> or <HI>that was not agreable to Truth.</HI>—Accordingly he <HI>began to read,</HI> the <HI>Substance</HI> of which was contain'd in about eight or ten Quarto Pages, and the <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of what he had to say</HI> was on the three following Heads: First, <HI>A Number of Lottery-Tickets Mr.</HI> Fletcher <HI>had ow'd him for:</HI> Secondly, <HI>A Wager Mr.</HI> Fletcher <HI>had laid with Mr.</HI> Gray <HI>about a Barrel of Pork:</HI> Thirdly, <HI>A Note put into his Hands, to be deliver'd up on the Settlement of some Disputes between Mr.</HI> Fletcher <HI>and Mr.</HI> Hall.</P>
<P>On the first Head he said, That Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> had wrong'd him out of some Tickets he ow'd him for, at least had detain'd the Payment of them so long, that he had lost <HI>some Ounces, Pennyweights, and Grains of Silver</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By this Calculation, Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> is certainly a good Arithmatician.</NOTE>, <HI>in the Depreciation of the Currency,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="007001_0020_102AE11ACAEA47F0"/>that is, that when the said <HI>Fletcher</HI> first ow'd him for the Tickets he could with the Currency then fluctuating, purchase <HI>so many Ounces, Pennyweights and Grains of Sil∣ver more than he could when the said</HI> Fletcher <HI>paid him;</HI>—and not only sustained <HI>this Loss,</HI> but by his not receiving the Tickets in the Time of it, he was induced to pur∣chase a Number of Tickets in the Lottery then to be drawn, <HI>and met with such bad Luck,</HI> that he sustain'd still <HI>a further Loss therein.</HI></P>
<P>On the second Head he said, <HI>in order to prove Mr.</HI> Fletcher <HI>a Man of bad Character, That he was inform'd that he once laid a Wager with Mr.</HI> Harrison Gray, <HI>of a Beaver Hat, that he the said</HI> Fletcher <HI>had got a Barrel of better Pork than Mr.</HI> Gray <HI>had, and in order to win the Wager, the said</HI> Fletcher <HI>order'd his Cooper in packing the Pork, to put the best Peices on the Top of the Barrel, which said</HI> Vassall <HI>said, he look'd upon to be a bad Thing.</HI></P>
<P>On the third and <HI>last Head</HI> he said, That he had formerly two Notes of Hand put into his keeping, sign'd by Mr. <HI>Hutchinson</HI> and others on the one Part, and by <HI>Andrew Hall</HI> on the other, which Note of said <HI>Hall</HI>'s was assign'd over to Mr. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> who then appear'd in the Room of Mr. <HI>Hutchinson, &amp;c.</HI> The Conditions of which Notes were, that in Case the said <HI>Hall</HI> should finally recover of the said <HI>Fletcher</HI> £. 8000 old Tenor, upon the Ballance of all Actions then depending in the Law between them, he was to deliver the Notes to Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> otherwise to Mr. <HI>Fletcher;</HI> that upon the Issue of these Disputes <HI>he took uncommon Pains</HI> in advising with a Number of his Friends respecting this Matter; but as there had been formerly a Dispute between Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> and him about some Tickets he did not care to determine the Affair, without some other Persons being join'd with him in it,—which was accordingly done, <HI>and finally they all agreed that the said</HI> Hall <HI>ought to have the said Notes,</HI> and thereupon he deliver'd them to said <HI>Hall;</HI> yet the said <HI>Fletcher</HI> had treated him very ill, notwith∣standing all the Pains he had taken in it.</P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had finish'd as above, <HI>which is the Substance of all he said,</HI>—Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> desir'd leave to answer him, and to clear himself from those Aspersions which Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had so unjustly charg'd upon him: Accordingly he began with what Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had charg'd him with, in cheating some Persons he had taken Money of on the Bottom of a Ship that was lost: Secondly, With Respect to the Ship his Brother sail'd in: And then by answering all Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had said in Vindication of himself.</P>
<P>As to the First, it appear'd that Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> was on his Journey to <HI>New-York</HI> (where the said Ship was bound for a Freight he had contracted for, on Account of the Government) at the very Time she was cast ashore on a Reef of Rocks in <HI>Nantasket,</HI> by an uncommon Storm, and that by her being so cast-away he lost several Thousands of Pounds, not having made any Insurance upon her; and as to the Money he had taken upon the Bottom of said Ship, upon a Dispute arising between him and the Persons he had the Money of, respecting their ha∣ving any Right to a Share of what was saved out of said Ship, he produced the fol∣lowing Agreement between him and those Persons; and notwithstanding he had sign'd a Bond to each of them (wrote by themselves) whereby they were wholly ex¦cluded from any Salvage whatever, yet he generously consented to destroy those Bonds, and leave it upon the Footing of Equity, to three principal Merchants in the Town,—whose Award he also produced — both which are as followeth.</P>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the Ship his Brother sail'd in, he made it appear by Capt. <HI>Freeman,</HI> the former Master of the Ship, and the Tradesmen that fitted her to Sea, that she was a strong good Ship, and sufficient to perform any Voyage whatever, and that she was freighted by the most considerable Merchants in the Town, with a Cargo of Fish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and perform'd the whole of the Voyage to his last hearing from her, without any Da∣mage, or Suspicion of Complaint whatever; and there was no room to suspect but that she met with some uncommon Disaster at Sea, as thousands of new Ships have done before.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> proceeded to answer what Mr. <HI>Vassall had been reading;</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>As to the Tickets,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> acknowledg'd that he formerly ow'd Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> about £. 10 Sterling, for some Tickets, and that the Reason of his not paying Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> for them, was owing to the said <HI>Vassall</HI>'s abusing of him on account thereof, but said, he always declar'd in the Time of it, he was ready to do it when∣ever
<PB N="37" REF="007001_0021_102AE11CE290C528"/>Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> should acknowledge his Fault; and that upon Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI>'s first Acknowledgment thereof, he instantly paid him to his Satisfaction; and produced Mr. <HI>Scott</HI>'s Evidence, that Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had made such Acknowledgments in several Companies. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Scott</HI>'s Evidence, Page 7.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Respecting the Barrel of Pork,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> said he had formerly <HI>in the Year</HI> 1745, over a Bowl of Punch with Mr. <HI>Harrison Gray</HI> (who was commending a Bar∣rel of Pork, which afterwards appear'd, he had pick'd out for his own Use<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid a bantering Wager with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Bowl of Punch, <HI>to his best Remembrance,</HI> that he had got a better Barrel of Pork than said <HI>Gray</HI> had, upon which Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> said he order'd his Cooper, who was then packing a large Quantity of Pork, to pick out a Barrel of the best of it, in order to win Mr. <HI>Gray</HI>'s Punch, which being done, Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> acknowledg'd he had lost, and then Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> laugh'd at him about the Manner of his winning the Wager,—but did not remember the Punch was ever paid.</P>
<P>Finally, as to what Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had said ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the Notes that were put in Trust into his Hands, Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> also acknowledg'd that upon Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI>'s De∣termination of the Property of them, he could not help saying, <HI>that Mr.</HI> Vassall <HI>was a — ignorant Fellow, and aid not know the Difference between Six and Eight,</HI> and that he should be glad to be satisfy'd that <HI>Ignorance</HI> was the sole Cause of such a Determination; and beg'd leave to prove what he had asserted: — In order to do this, Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> allow'd the Conditions, upon which those Notes were given to be as Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had asserted, <HI>viz.</HI> that if said <HI>Hall</HI> should finally recover against him £. 8000, on the Ballance of all Actions then depending in the Law between them, said <HI>Vassall</HI> was to deliver said Notes to said <HI>Hall,</HI> otherwise to him, and then pro∣duced a Certificate under the Hand of the Clerk of the Court of all the Actions pend∣ing in the Law at the Time when said Notes were given, as also another Certificate under the Hands of <HI>Creen, Avery,</HI> and <HI>Russell,</HI> (to whom all the Disputes between him and said <HI>Hall</HI> were referr'd) that upon the Determination of the Actions afore∣said there was not a Ballance of £. 7000 due to said <HI>Hall</HI> (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is fully set forth in said Certificate in the Appendix) by all which it plainly appears, that the Note ought not to have been deliver'd to Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> but to Mr. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> so that he had good Reason to blame Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> as he did:—Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> further said, that he had enquir'd of one of the Gentlemen that was concern'd with Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> in the Determination of those Notes, and was acquainted by him, that they had left it to Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> to get an Account of those Actions, and that Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had brought them in an Account, which in the Time of it, they tho't was true, but if it was not they were deceiv'd and he hop'd they should be excused on that Account.</P>
<P>As soon as Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> and Mr. <HI>Vassall</HI> had done speaking, Mr. <HI>Gridley</HI> for the Defendant, and the King's-Attorney, <HI>Edmond Trowbridge,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for the Plantiff, closed the Case that Afternoon, and it was committed to the Jury, who bro't in the following</P>
