<L>KIND gentlemen will you be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tient a while,</L>
<L>Ay, and then you shall hear anon,</L>
<L>A very good ballad of bold Robin Hood,</L>
<L>And his brave man little John.</L>
<L>In Loxy town in merry Nottinghamshire,</L>
<L>In merry sweet Loxy town,</L>
<L>There bold Robin Hood was born and bred,</L>
<L>Bold Robin of fame and renown.</L>
<L>The father of Robin a forester was,</L>
<L>And he shot a lusty long bow,</L>
<L>Two north country miles and an inch at a shot,</L>
<L>As the pindar of Wakefield doth know.</L>
<L>For the brought Adam Bell, and Clin of the Clough</L>
<L>With William of Cloudesly,</L>
<L>To shoot with our forester for forty marks,</L>
<L>And the forester beat them all three.</L>

And flew the great boar that hung up at the gate</L>
<L>Or mine holl at the bull tells a lie.</L>
<L>Her brother was Gamwell of great Gamwell hall</L>
<L>And a noble house keeper was he,</L>
<L>Ay, as ever broke bread in Nottinghamshire,</L>
<L>And a 'Squire of famous degree.</L>
<L>This mother of Robin said to her husband,</L>
<L>My honey, my dove, and my dear,</L>
<L>Let Robin and I ride this morning to Gamwell,</L>
<L>To taste of my brother's good cheer.</L>
<L>And he said I grant thee thy boon, gentle Joan,</L>
<L>Take one of my horses I pray,</L>
<L>The sun it is rising, therefore make haste,</L>
<L>For to-morrow is Christmas day.</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood's father's grey gelding was bro't,</L>
<L>And sadled and bridled was he,</L>
<L>As also his bonnet and new suit of cloaths,</L>
<L>And a cloak that reach'd down to his knee.</L>
<L>She got on her holliday kirtlet and gown,</L>
<L>They were of a light Lincoln grean,</L>
<L>The cloth was homespun, but colour and make</L>
<L>It might well be-suited a qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n,</L>
<L>And then Robin got on his basket-hilt sword,</L>
<L>And dagger on the other side.</L>
<L>And said my dear mother, let's haste be gone,</L>
<L>We have forty miles to ride.</L>
<L>When Robin had mounted his gelding so grey,</L>
<L>His father without any trouble,</L>
<L>Set her up behind him, and bid her not fear,</L>
<L>For his gelding had oft carry'd double.</L>
<L>When he was settled, they rode to the neighbors,</L>
<L>And drank and shook hands with them all,</L>
<L>And then Robin gallop'd, and ne'er gave o'er,</L>
<L>Till he lighted at Gamwell hall.</L>

<L>Six <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bles were laid in the hall,</L>
<L>And in comes the 'Squire and makes a short speech</L>

<L>And now call my little John hither to me,</L>
<L>for little John is a fine lad.</L>
<L>At gambols, and jiggling, and twenty-five trisks,</L>

<L>When little John came, they all to gambols went</L>
<L>Both gentieman, yeomen and clown,</L>
<L>And what do you think? Why, as true as I live,</L>
<L>Bold Robin Hood put them all down.</L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="037827_0005_100F809686E28708"/>
Then grant me my boon, dear uncle, said Robin,</L>
<L>That little John may be my page.</L>
<L>And he said, kind cousin, I grant thee thy boon,</L>
<L>With all my heart, so let it be,</L>
<L>Then come hither little John, said Robin Hood</L>
<L>Come hither little page to me.</L>
<L>Go fetch me my bow, my longest long bow,</L>
<L>And broad arrows, one, two, or three,</L>
<L>For when 'tis fair weather we'll unto Sherwood,</L>
<L>Some merry pastime for to see.</L>
<L>When Robin came unto merry Sherwood,</L>
<L>He winded his buggle so clear,</L>
<L>And twice five and twenty good yeomen bold,</L>
<L>Before Robin Hood did appear.</L>
<L>Where are all your companions? said Robin Hood,</L>
<L>For still I want forty and three.</L>
<L>Then said a bold yeoman, Lo, yonder they stand</L>
<L>All under a fine green wood tree.</L>
<L>As that word was spoken, Clorinda came by,</L>
<L>The queen of the shepherds was she;</L>
<L>Her gown was of velvet as green as the grass,</L>
<L>And her buskin did reach to her knee.</L>
<L>Her gate it was graceful, her body was straight,</L>
<L>Her countenace free from pride;</L>
<L>A bow in her hand, and a quiver of arrows</L>
<L>Hung dangling down by her side.</L>
<L>Her eye-brows were black, ay! and so was her hair</L>
<L>And her skin was as smooth as glass:</L>
<L>Her visage spoke wisdom and modesty too</L>
<L>Sets with Robin Hood such a lass.</L>
<L>Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, whither away▪</L>
<L>Oh! whither fair lady away?</L>
<L>She made him answer, to kill a fat buck,</L>
<L>For to-morrow is Tidbury day.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="037827_0006_100F80981D282450"/>
Said Robin Hood, lady fair, wander with me,</L>
<L>A little with me to yon bower,</L>
<L>There sit and rest you, and you shall be sure</L>
<L>Of a brace or a lease in an hour.</L>
<L>As they were going towards the green bower,</L>
<L>Two hundred good bucks they espy'd,</L>
<L>She chose of the fattest that was in the herd,</L>
<L>And she shot him through side and side.</L>
<L>By the saith of my body, said Robin Hood, West,</L>
<L>I never saw woman like thee:</L>
<L>And comest thou from Eeast, or comest thou from</L>
<L>Thou nee'dst not beg venison of me.</L>
<L>However along to my bower you shall go,</L>
<L>And taste of thus fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sters meat:</L>
<L>And when we came there, we found as good cheer,</L>
<L>As any man need for to eat.</L>
<L>For ther ewas hot venison, and warden pies,</L>
<L>Cream clouted with honey comb plenty:</L>
<L>And servitors there were, besides little John,</L>
<L>Of good yeomen bold four and twenty.</L>
<L>Clorinda said, Tell me your name, gentle Sir!</L>
<L>And he said, It's bold Robin Hood:</L>
<L>"Squire Gamwell's my uncle, but all my delight,</L>
<L>Is to dwell in merry Sherwood:</L>
<L>For 'tis a fine life, and void of all strife,</L>
<L>So 'tis, sir, Clorinda reply'd.</L>
<L>But oh! said bold Robin, how sweet should it be.</L>
<L>If Clorinda would now be my bride.</L>
<L>She blush'd at this motion, yet after a pause,</L>
<L>Said, yes sir, with all my heart.</L>
<L>Then let us send for a priest, said Robin flood,</L>
<L>And be married before we do part.</L>
<L>But she said, it may not be so, gentle fir,</L>
<L>For I must be at Tidbury feast:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="037827_0007_100F8099C4D87698"/>
And if Robirt Hood will go there with me,</L>
<L>I'll make him the most welcome guest.</L>
<L>Said Robin Hood, Reach me that buck little Joln,</L>
<L>For I'll go along with my dear:</L>
<L>So bid my good yeomen kill six brace of bucks,</L>
<L>And meet me to-morrow just here.</L>
<L>Before they had ridden five staffordshire miles,</L>
<L>Eight yeomen that were brave and bold,</L>
<L>Bid Robin Hood stand, and deliver his buck,</L>
<L>A truer tale never was told.</L>
<L>I will not faith, said bold Robin, come little John,</L>
<L>Stand to me, and we'll beat them all.</L>
<L>Then both drew their swords, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them and</L>
<L>That five of the eight did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them.</L>
<L>The three that remain'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for quar∣ters,</L>
<L>And pitiful John begg'd their lives.</L>
<L>Then John's boon was granted, he gave them good counsel,</L>
<L>And so they went home to their wives.</L>
<L>This battle was fought near Tidbury town,</L>
<L>When bag pipes peaced, the bull:</L>
<L>I'm king of the fiddlers, and swear it is truth,</L>
<L>And call him that doubts it a gull.</L>
<L>For I saw them fighting and fiddled the while.</L>
<L>And Clorinda <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, Aye derry down;</L>
<L>The bumkins are beaton, put up your sword Bob.</L>
<L>And let's dance into the town.</L>
<L>Before we came to it we heard a great shouting,</L>
<L>And all that were in it looks madly:</L>
<L>For some were a bull bace, some dancing a mor∣rie,</L>
<L>And singing brave Art<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur a Bradly.</L>
<L>And there we saw. Thomas our justice's clerk,</L>
<L>And Mary to whom he was hind:</L>
<L>For Tom rode before her, and call'd Mary madam</L>
<L>And kiss'd her sweetly behind.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="037827_0008_100F809FC82AF910"/>
And so may your worships; but we went to dinner,</L>
<L>With good Thomas, Mary and Nan,</L>
<L>They all drank a health to Clorinda, and told her,</L>
<L>Bold Robin Hood was a fine man.</L>
<L>When dinner was ended, Sir Roger, the Parson</L>
<L>Of Dubridge, was sent for in haste;</L>
<L>He brought his mass-book and bid them take hands,</L>
<L>And join'd them in marriage full fast.</L>
<L>And then as bold Robin Hood and his sweet bride,</L>
<L>Went hand in hand to a green bower,</L>
<L>The bride sung with pleasure in merry Sherwood</L>
<L>And 'twas a most delightful hour.</L>
<L>Where Robin Hood came in sight of his bower,</L>
<L>Where are my yeomen? said he,</L>
<L>Little John answer'd, lo yonder they stand,</L>
<L>All under the green wood tree.</L>
<L>Then garlands they brought her two and two,</L>
<L>And plac'd them in the bride's bed,</L>
<L>The music struck up and they all fell to dance,</L>
<L>Till the bride and the groom were in bed.</L>
<L>And what they did there must be counsel to me.</L>
<L>Because they lay long the next day,</L>
<L>And I made haste home, and got a good piece</L>
<L>Of the bride's cake, and so came away.</L>
<L>Now, alas, I had forgotten to tell ye,</L>
<L>That married they were with a ring;</L>
<L>And so will Nan Night, or be buried a maiden.</L>
<L>And now let us frolic and sing.</L>

<L>ROBIN HOOD was a tall young man,</L>

<L>Of courage stout and bold:</L>
<L>Robin Hood he went unto fair Nottingham,</L>
<L>With the general for to dine,</L>
<L>There was he aware of fifteen foresters,</L>
<L>All drinking ale and wine.</L>
<L>What news, what news? said Robin Hood;</L>
<L>What news fain wouldst thou know?</L>
<L>Our King hath appointed a shooting match,</L>
<L>And I am ready with my bow.</L>
<L>We hold it in scorn, then said the foresters.</L>
<L>That ever a boy so young,</L>
<L>Should bear a bow before the King,</L>
<L>That is not able to draw one string.</L>
<L>We'll hold you twenty marks, said bold Robin Hood</L>
<L>By the leave of our lady,</L>
<L>That I'll hit the mark an hundred rood,</L>
<L>And I'll cause a hart to die.</L>
<L>We'll hold you twenty, marks then said the for∣esters,</L>

Thou hit'st not the mark, an hundred rood,</L>

<L>Robin Hood he bent a noble bow,</L>
<L>And a broad arrow he let fly,</L>
<L>He hit the mark a hundred rood,</L>
<L>And caused an hart to die.</L>
<L>Some says he broke ribs one or two,</L>
<L>And some say he broke three:</L>
<L>The arrow in one hart would not abide,</L>
<L>But it glanc'd through two or three.</L>
<L>The hart did skip, and the hart did leap,</L>
<L>And the hart lay on the ground.</L>
<L>The wager is mine, said Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Wer't for a thousand pound,</L>
<L>The wager's none of thine said the foresters,</L>
<L>Altho' thou be'st in haste,</L>
<L>Take up thy bow and get thee hence,</L>
<L>Lest we thy sides do baste:</L>
<L>Robin Hood took up his noble bow,</L>
<L>And his broad arrows let fly,</L>
<L>Till fourteen of these foresters</L>
<L>Upon the ground did lie.</L>
<L>He that did the quarrel first begin</L>
<L>Went tripping o'er the plain,</L>
<L>But Robin bent his noble bow,</L>
<L>And fetch'd him back again.</L>
<L>You said I was no archer, quoth Robin Hood,</L>
<L>But say you now again,</L>

<L>Which sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it his head in twain.</L>

<L>No mercy he'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> show unto me I know,</L>

<L>And take thou my arrows so keen.</L>
<L>And when that Robin Hood was so array'd,</L>
<L>He went straight to his company;</L>
<L>O who is yonder, said little John,</L>
<L>That now comes over the lee;</L>
<L>An arrow I will at her let flee.</L>
<L>So like an old witch looks she.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="037827_0015_100F80B43B0DC858"/>
O hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin then</L>
<L>And shoot not thy arrows so keen;</L>
<L>I am Robin Hood, thy master good,</L>
<L>And quickly it shall be seen.</L>
<L>The bishop he came to the old woman's house,</L>
<L>And he call'd with furious mood,</L>
<L>Come let me soon see, and bring unto me,</L>
<L>That traitor Robin Hood.</L>
<L>The old woman she sat on a milk-white sleed,</L>
<L>Himself on a dapple grey;</L>
<L>And for joy he had got Robin Hood,</L>
<L>He rode laughing all the way.</L>
<L>But as they were riding the forest along,</L>
<L>The Bishop he chanced to see</L>
<L>An hundred bowmen brave and bold,</L>
<L>Stand under the greenwood tree,</L>
<L>O who is yonder, the bishop he said,</L>
<L>That is ranging within yonder wood?</L>
<L>Marry, said the old woman, I think it to be</L>
<L>A man call'd Robin Hood.</L>
<L>Who, who art thou, the bishop he said,</L>
<L>Which I have here with me?</L>
<L>Why I am an old woman, thou cuckoldy bishop,</L>
<L>Lift up my leg and see,</L>
<L>Then woe to me, the bishop he said,</L>
<L>That ever I saw this day:</L>
<L>He turn'd him about, but Robin Hood so stout,</L>
<L>Call'd to him and bid him stay.</L>
<L>Then Robin took hold of the Bishop's horse,</L>
<L>And ty'd him fast to a tree:</L>
<L>Then little John smil'd his master upon,</L>
<L>For joy of that company,</L>
<L>Robin took his mantle from his back,</L>
<L>And spread it upon the ground,</L>
<L>And out of the bishop's portmanteau he</L>
<L>Soon took out five hundred pound.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="037827_0016_100F80B7663B4310"/>
So now let him go, said Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Said little John, that may not be;</L>
<L>For I vow and protest, he shall sing a mass,</L>
<L>Before that he go from me.</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood took the bishop by the hand,</L>
<L>And bound him fast to a tree;</L>
<L>And made him sing a mass, Got wot.</L>
<L>To him and his yeomen dree.</L>
<L>And then they brought him thro' the wood,</L>
<L>And set him on his dapple grey,</L>
<L>And gave him the tail within his hand,</L>
<L>And bade him for Robin Hood pray.</L>

Bold Robin in the forest did spy</L>
<L>A jolly butcher with a bonny fine mare.</L>
<L>With his flesh to the market did hie.</L>
<L>Good morrow, good-fellow, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>What food hast thou? tell unto me;</L>
<L>Thy trade to me tell, and where thou dost dwell,</L>
<L>For I like well thy company.</L>
<L>The butcher he answer'd jolly Robin,</L>
<L>No matter where I do dwell,</L>
<L>For a butcher I am, and to Nottingham,</L>
<L>I am going my flesh to sell.</L>
<L>What's the price of thy flesh? said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>Come tell it soon to me;</L>
<L>And the price of thy mare be she never so dear,</L>
<L>For a butcher fain would I be,</L>
<L>The price of my flesh, the butcher reply'd,</L>
<L>I soon will tell unto thee;</L>
<L>With my bonny mare, and they are not dear,</L>
<L>Foor marks thou must give me:</L>
<L>Thy money come count, and then I will mount,</L>
<L>For a butcher I fain would be.</L>
<L>Now Robin he is to Nottingham gone,</L>
<L>His butcher's trade to begin:</L>
<L>With a good intent to the Sheriff's he went,</L>
<L>And there he took up his inn.</L>
<L>When other butchers did open their shops,</L>
<L>Bold Robin he then began.</L>
<L>But how for to sell, he did not know well,</L>
<L>For a butcher he was but young.</L>
<L>When other butchers no meat could sell,</L>
<L>Robin he got both gold and see,</L>
<L>For he sold more meat for one penny.</L>
<L>Than others could do for three.</L>
<L>But when he sold his meat so fast,</L>
<L>No butcher by him could thrive,</L>
<L>For he sold more for one penny,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="037827_0018_100F797F9EDFA408"/>
Than others could do for five.</L>
<L>Which made the butchers of Nottingham</L>
<L>To study as they did stand,</L>
<L>Saying he is some great prodigal,</L>
<L>That hath sold his father's land.</L>
<L>The butchers stept to jolly Robin,</L>
<L>Acquainted with him for to be,</L>
<L>Come, brother, one said, we'll be all of one trade</L>
<L>Come will you go dine with me.</L>
<L>A curse to his heart, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>That a butcher will deny,</L>
<L>I will go with you my brethren true,</L>
<L>And as fast as I can hie.</L>
<L>But when to the Sheriff's house they came,</L>
<L>To dinner they hied apace,</L>
<L>For Robin he, and the man must be,</L>
<L>Before them all to say grace,</L>
<L>Pray God bless us all, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>And our meat within this place,</L>
<L>A cup of sack so good, will nourish your blood,</L>
<L>And so I do end my grace,</L>
<L>Come fill us more wine, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>Let us be merry while we stay;</L>
<L>For wine and good cheer, be it never so dear,</L>
<L>I vow I the reckoning will pay.</L>
<L>Come, brothers, be merry, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>Let us drink, and me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rily give o'er.</L>
<L>For the shot I will pay ere I go away,</L>

<L>Then the Sheriff d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> say, God bless us this day.</L>
<L>From a man they call Robin Hood.</L>
<L>But when that a little farther they came,</L>

<L>How like you my horned beasts, good master Sher∣iff?</L>
<L>They're both sat and fair to see.</L>
<L>The Sheriff reply'd, I wish I were gone,</L>

<L>Then Robin he set his horn to his mouth,</L>
<L>And shew out strong blasts three,</L>

<L>What is your will, master, said little John,</L>

<L>He is welcome to me, then said little John,</L>
<L>I hope he will honestly pay;</L>
<L>I know he has gold, and if it were told,</L>

<OPENER>TUNE—ROBIN HOOD AND THE STRANGER.</OPENER>
<L>IN Nottingham lives a jolly Tanner,</L>
<L>With a hey down, down, and a down,</L>
<L>His name is Arthur a Bland;</L>
<L>There is never a 'Squire in Nottinghamshire,</L>
<L>Dare bid bold Arthur to stand.</L>
<L>With a long pike staff upon his shoulder,</L>
<L>So well he can clear his way;</L>
<L>By two and by three he makes them to flee,</L>
<L>For he has no list to stay,</L>
<L>As soon as he went forth in a summer morning</L>
<L>Into the forest of merry Sherwood,</L>
<L>To view the red deer, that sport here and there</L>
<L>He met with bold Robin Hood.</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="037827_0021_100F80C418CF5568"/>
As soon as bold Robin did him espy,</L>
<L>He thought some sport he might make,</L>
<L>Therefore out of hand, he bid him to stand,</L>
<L>And thus unto him did speak:</L>
<L>Why, what art thou, thou base fellow,</L>
<L>That ranges so boldly here?</L>
<L>In sooth to be so brief, thou lookst like a thief,</L>
<L>That comes to steal the King's deer.</L>
<L>For I am keeper in this forest,</L>
<L>The King hath put me in trust:</L>
<L>To look to his deer that range here and there,</L>
<L>Therefore now slay thee I must.</L>
<L>If thou be'st a keeper in this forest,</L>
<L>And hath such great command,</L>
<L>Yet thou must have more partakers in store,</L>
<L>Before thou makest me to stand.</L>
<L>No, I have no more partakers in store,</L>
<L>Or any that I do need,</L>
<L>But I have a staff of a strong oak graff,</L>
<L>I know it will do thy need.</L>
<L>For thy sword and thy bow I care not a straw,</L>
<L>Nor all thy armour to boot;</L>
<L>If thou gettest a knock upon thy bare scalp,</L>
<L>Thou canst as well shite as shoot.</L>
<L>Speak cleanly, good fellow, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>And give better terms to me,</L>
<L>Else I'll thee correct for thy neglect,</L>
<L>And make thee more mannerly.</L>
<L>Marry gap with a wenion, quoth Arthur a Bland</L>
<L>Art thou such a goodly man?</L>
<L>I care not a fig for thy looking so big,</L>
<L>Mead thy self where thou can.</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood he unbuckled his belt,</L>
<L>And laid down his bow so long,</L>
<L>He took up a staff of a strong oak graff,</L>
<L>That was both stiff and strong.</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="037827_0022_100F80C5AA6EB390"/>
I yield to thy weapons, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>If thou wilt but yield to mine;</L>
<L>For I a have a staff of a strong oak graff,</L>
<L>Not half a foot longer than thine.</L>
<L>But let me measure said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>Before we begin our fray,</L>
<L>For I will not have mine longer than thine,</L>
<L>For that would be counted foul play.</L>
<L>I pass not for length, bold Arthur reply'd,</L>
<L>My staff is of oak so free,</L>
<L>Eight foot and a half will knock down a calf,</L>
<L>And I hope it will knock down thee.</L>
<L>Then Robin he could no longer forbear,</L>
<L>But gave him so hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a knock,</L>
<L>That quickly and soon the blood it ran down,</L>
<L>Before it was ten o'clock.</L>
<L>But Arthur he soon recover'd himself,</L>
<L>And gave him a knock an the crown,</L>
<L>That from every hair of Robin's head</L>
<L>The blood ran trickling down,</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood raged like a wild boar</L>
<L>As soon as he saw his own blood;</L>
<L>And Bland was in hafie, and laid on so fast,</L>
<L>As if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e'd been cleaving of wood.</L>
<L>And about, and about, and about they went.</L>
<L>Like two wild boars in a chase,</L>
<L>Striving with aim each other to maim,</L>
<L>Leg, arm, or any other place.</L>
<L>And knock for knock they lustily dealt,</L>
<L>Which held for two hours and more,</L>
<L>That all the wood rang with every b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng,</L>
<L>They ply'd their work so sore.</L>
<L>Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood.</L>
<L>And let our bloody quarrel-fall.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="037827_0023_100F80C895C209B0"/>
For he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e we may thrash our bones all to mash,</L>
<L>And have no money at all.</L>
<L>And in the forest of merry Sherwood,</L>

<L>Cry a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rcy for nought, my freedom I bought,</L>
<L>I may thank my staff but not thee.</L>
<L>What tradesman art thou, said jolly Robin,</L>

<L>And also me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tt where thou dost d well,</L>
<L>For both of them sain would I know?</L>
<L>I am a tanner, bold Arthur reply'd,</L>
<L>In Nottingham long have I wrought;</L>
<L>And if thou come there, I vow and do swear,</L>

<L>Cry a mercy, good fellow, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>Since thou art so kind and free;</L>
<L>And if thou will tan my hide for nought,</L>
<L>I will do as much for thee.</L>
<L>But if thou wilt forsake thy tanner's trade,</L>
<L>And live in the green wood with me:</L>
<L>My name's Robin Hood, I swear by the wood,</L>
<L>I will give thee both gold and fee.</L>
<L>If thou be Robin Hood, bold Arthur reply'd,</L>

<L>Then there's my hand, my name's Arthura Bland,</L>
<L>We two will never pant.</L>
<L>But tell me, O tell me, where is little John,</L>
<L>Of him fain would I hear,</L>
<L>For we are ally'd by the mother's side,</L>
<L>And he is my kinsman near.</L>
<L>Then Robin blew on his bugle horn,</L>
<L>And blew both loud and shrill:</L>
<L>But quickly and anon, appeard little John,</L>
<L>Come tripping down a green hill.</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="037827_0024_100F80CEA40C31F8"/>
O what is the matter, then said li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le John,</L>
<L>Master I pray you me tell?</L>
<L>Why do you stand with your staff in your hand,</L>
<L>I fear that all is not well.</L>
<L>O man I do stand, and he makes me to stand,</L>
<L>The tanner that stands she beside,</L>
<L>He is a bonny blade, and master of his trade,</L>

<L>And run out of hand to Arthur a Bland,</L>
<L>And about his neck did cling.</L>
<L>With loving respect, there was no neglect,</L>

<L>Each other did face with a lovely grace,</L>

<L>It is but as I hear,</L>
<L>Two tinkers they were i'th stocks</L>
<L>For drinking ale and beer,</L>
<L>If that be all, the tinker said,</L>

<L>It is to seek a bold out law</L>
<L>Which they call Robin Hood;</L>
<L>I have a warrant from the King,</L>
<L>To take him where I can,</L>
<L>If you c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n tell me where he is,</L>

And where he is if you'll not tell,</L>

<L>But Robin Hood perceiving well</L>
<L>How then the game would go,</L>
<L>If you will go to Nottingham,</L>
<L>We shall find him I know.</L>
<L>The tinker had a crab-tree staff,</L>
<L>Which was both good and strong,</L>
<L>Robin he had a good strong blade,</L>
<L>So they went both along.</L>
<L>And when they came to Nottingham,</L>
<L>There they took up their Inn;</L>
<L>And they call'd both for ale and wine,</L>
<L>To drink it was no sin.</L>
<L>But ale and wine they drank so fast,</L>
<L>The tinker he forgot,</L>
<L>What things he was about to do,</L>
<L>It fell so to his lot.</L>
<L>That while the tinker fell asleep,</L>
<L>He made then haste away,</L>
<L>And left the tinker in the lurch,</L>
<L>For a great shot to pay.</L>
<L>But when the tinker awakened,</L>
<L>And found that he was gone,</L>
<L>And call'd then for his kind host,</L>
<L>And thus he made his moan.</L>
<L>I had a warrant from the King,</L>
<L>That might have done me good,</L>
<L>That is to seek a bold out-law,</L>
<L>Some call him Robin Hood.</L>
<L>But now my warrant and money's gone</L>
<L>Nothing I have to pay;</L>
<L>He that promised to be my friend,</L>
<L>He's gone and fled away.</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="037827_0028_100F80DA477C1B70"/>
That friend you speak of said the host</L>
<L>They call him Robin Hood,</L>
<L>When that first he met with you,</L>
<L>He meant you little good.</L>
<L>Had I but known it had been he.</L>
<L>When that I had him here,</L>
<L>The one of us should try our strength.</L>
<L>Which should have paid full dear.</L>
<L>In the mean time I must away,</L>
<L>No longer here I'll abide,</L>
<L>But I will go and seek him out,</L>
<L>Wherever do betide:</L>
<L>But one thing I would gladly know,</L>
<L>What I have here to pay?</L>
<L>Ten shillings just, answer'd his host,</L>
<L>I'll pay without delay.</L>
<L>Or else take here my working bag,</L>
<L>And my good hammer too,</L>
<L>And if I light but on the knave,</L>
<L>I will then soon you pay.</L>
<L>The only way then said the host,</L>
<L>And not to stand in fear,</L>
<L>Is to seek him among the parks,</L>
<L>Killing of the king's deer.</L>
<L>The tinker he then went with speed,</L>
<L>And made then no delay,</L>
<L>Till he found out bold Robin Hood,</L>
<L>That he might have a fray.</L>
<L>At last he spy'd him in a park.</L>
<L>Hunting of the deer,</L>
<L>What knave is that, quoth Robin hood,</L>
<L>That cometh me so near?</L>
<L>No knave, no knave, the tinker said,</L>
<L>And that you soon shall know;</L>

Which of us hath done most wrong,</L>
<L>My crab tree staff shall show.</L>
<L>Then Robin drew his gallant blade.</L>
<L>Made of the trusty steel,</L>
<L>But the tinker he laid on so fast,</L>
<L>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he made Robin reel.</L>
<L>Then Robin's anger did arise,</L>
<L>He fought most manfully,</L>
<L>Until he made the tinker then,</L>
<L>Almost fit to flee.</L>
<L>With that they laid about again,</L>
<L>They ply'd their weapons fast;</L>
<L>The tinker thresh'd his bones so sore</L>
<L>That made him yield at last.</L>
<L>A boon, a boon, Robin he cries,</L>
<L>If thou will grant it me,</L>
<L>Before I do it, the tinker said,</L>
<L>I'll hang thee on this tree.</L>
<L>But the tinker looking him about,</L>
<L>Robin his horn did blow;</L>
<L>Then came unto him little John,</L>
<L>And brave Will Scarlet too.</L>
<L>What is the matter quoth little John,</L>
<L>You sit on the high way side?</L>
<L>Here is a tinker that stands hard by,</L>
<L>That hath paid well my hide.</L>
<L>That tinker then said little John,</L>
<L>That blade fain would I see;</L>
<L>And I would try what I could do,</L>
<L>If he'll do as much for me.</L>
<L>But Robin he wish d t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em both,</L>
<L>They would the quarrel cease,</L>
<L>That henceforth they might be as one.</L>
<L>And ever live in pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce.</L>

In the year to maintain him one,</L>
<L>As long as he doth live,</L>
<L>In manhood he's a mettle man,</L>
<L>And a mettle man by trade,</L>
<L>I never thought that any man,</L>

<L>And if he would be one of us,</L>
<L>We will take one face,</L>
<L>And whatsoever we dogs,</L>
<L>He shall have hi full strare.</L>
<L>So that the tinker was content,</L>

<L>All you that love mirth for to hear,</L>
<L>And I will you tell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bold out-law,</L>
<L>That liv'd in Northamptonshire</L>
<L>As Robin Hood in the forest stood,</L>
<L>All under the greenwood tree;</L>
<L>There was he aware of a brave young man,</L>
<L>As fine as fine may be.</L>
<L>Then step'd forth brave li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e John,</L>
<L>And Midge the miller's son,</L>
<L>Which made the young man bend his bow,</L>
<L>When be see them come.</L>
<L>Stand off, stand off, the young man said,</L>
<L>What is your will with me?</L>
<L>You must come before our master straight,</L>
<L>Under you greenwood tree.</L>
<L>And when he came bold Robin before,</L>
<L>Robin ask'd him courtoously,</L>
<L>O hast thou any money to spare,</L>
<L>For my merry men and me?</L>
<L>I have no money; the young man said,</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="037827_0032_100F80E644D19CB0"/>
But five shillings and a ring;</L>
<L>And that I'have kept these soven son, years,</L>
<L>To have it at my wedding.</L>
<L>Yesterday I should have married a maid,</L>
<L>But she was from me ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en;</L>
<L>And chosen to be an old Knight's delight,</L>
<L>Where by my poor heart was slain.</L>
<L>What is thy name? then said Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Come tell me without sail:</L>
<L>By the faith of my body, then said the young man,</L>
<L>My name is Allen a-Dale.</L>
<L>What wilt thou give me, said Robin Hood,</L>
<L>In ready gold or see,</L>
<L>I've no money, then said the young man,</L>
<L>No ready gold or see;</L>
<L>But I will swear upon the book,</L>
<L>Thy true servant for to be,</L>
<L>How many miles is it to thy true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove,</L>
<L>Come tell me without guile?</L>
<L>By the faith of my body, then said the young-man,</L>
<L>It is but five little miles.</L>
<L>Then Robin he halled over the plain,</L>
<L>He did neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in,</L>
<L>Until he came into the church.</L>
<L>Where Allen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould keep his wedding.</L>
<L>What dost thou here, the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop then said,</L>
<L>I prithee now tell unto me?</L>
<L>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a bold hurp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, quoth Robin Hood,</L>

<L><PB N="34" REF="037827_0033_100F80E918D7CD60"/>
With that came in a worthy knight,</L>
<L>Which was both grave and old,</L>
<L>And after him a finikin lass,</L>
<L>Did shine like the glittering gold.</L>
<L>This is not a fit match, quoth Robin Hood.</L>
<L>That you do seem to make here;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or since we are come into the church,</L>
<L>The bride shall chuse her own dear.</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood put horn to his mouth.</L>
<L>And blew blasts two or three</L>
<L>Then four and twenty bowmen bold</L>
<L>Came leaping over the lee.</L>
<L>And when they came to the church-yard,</L>
<L>Marching all in a row.</L>
<L>The first man was Allen a Dale,</L>
<L>To give bold Robin his bow.</L>
<L>This is thy true love, Robin he said,</L>
<L>Young Allen, as I hear say,</L>
<L>And you shall be married at the same time,</L>
<L>Before we depart away.</L>
<L>That may not be, the Bishop he said,</L>
<L>For thy words shall not stand;</L>
<L>They shall be ask'd three time in the church,</L>
<L>As the law is of our land,</L>
<L>Robin Hood pull'd off the Bishop's coat,</L>
<L>And put it upon little John;</L>
<L>By the faith of my body, then Robin he said,</L>
<L>This coat doth make thee a man.</L>
<L>When little John went to the choir.</L>
<L>The people began to laugh,</L>
<L>He ask'd them seven times in the choir,</L>
<L>Lest three would not be enough,</L>
<L>Who gives this maid? quoth little John,</L>
<L>Quoth Robin Hood, that do I,</L>
<L>And he who takes her from Allen a Dale,</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="037827_0034_100F80EAAAA44A50"/>
Full dearly shall he buy.</L>
<L>And thus having ended the merry wedding,</L>
<L>The bride look'd like a Queen;</L>
<L>And so they return'd to the merry greenwood,</L>
<L>Among the leaves so green.</L>

<L>I wish you to draw near.</L>

<L>Unto you I will declare.</L>
<L>As Robin Hood walk'd the forest along,</L>
<L>Some pastime for to spy,</L>
<L>There was he aware of a jolly shepherd,</L>
<L>That on the ground did lie.</L>
<L>Arise, arise, said jolly Robin,</L>
<L>And now come let me see,</L>
<L>What is in thy bag and bottle, I say,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="037827_0035_100F80EC5ACC4E48"/>
Come tell it unto me.</L>
<L>What's that to thee? thou proud fellow,</L>
<L>Tell me as I do stand,</L>
<L>What hast thou to do with my bag and bottle?</L>
<L>Let me see say command.</L>
<L>My sword that hangeth by my side.</L>
<L>Is my command I know:</L>
<L>Come let me taste of thy bottle,</L>

<L>Of my bottle thou shalt see,</L>
<L>Until thy valor here be try'd,</L>
<L>Whither thou wilt fight or flee.</L>
<L>What shall we fight for? says Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Come tell it soon to me:</L>
<L>Here's twenty pounds in good yellow gold,</L>
<L>Win it and take it thee.</L>
<L>The shepherd stood all in a maze.</L>
<L>And knew not what to say,</L>
<L>I have no money thou proud fellow,</L>
<L>But bag and bottle I'll lay.</L>
<L>I am content thou shepherd swain,</L>
<L>Fling them down on the ground;</L>
<L>But it will breed thee meikle pain,</L>
<L>To win my twenty pound.</L>

<L>It was on a summer's day;</L>
<L>From ten till four in the afternoon,</L>
<L>The shepherd held in play.</L>

<L><PB N="37" REF="037827_0036_100F80F243AAFED0"/>
For every blow the shepherd gave,</L>

<L>Many a sturdy blow the shepherd gave,</L>
<L>And that bold Robin found;</L>
<L>Till the blood ran trickling from his head,</L>
<L>Then he fell to the ground.</L>
<L>Arise, arise thou proud fellow,</L>
<L>And thou shalt have fair play,</L>
<L>If thou wilt yield before thou go,</L>

<L>A boon, a boon, cry'd bold Robin Hood,</L>
<L>If that a man thou be,</L>

<L>For if thou should<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> blow till to-morrow morn,</L>
<L>I scorn the foot to flee.</L>

<L>What is the matter, says little John,</L>

<L>My case is bad, cries Robin Hood,</L>

The shepherd gave John a sturdy blow,</L>
<L>With his book under the chin,</L>
<L>Beshrew thy heart, said little John,</L>
<L>Thou basesy does begin,</L>
<L>Nay, that does nothing, says the shepherd,</L>

<OPENER>To a New Tune.</OPENER>
<L>COME listen a while you gentleman all,</L>
<L>With a hey down, down and a down,</L>
<L>That are in this bower within;</L>
<L>For a story of gailant Robin Hood,</L>
<L>I do purpose now to begin.</L>
<L>As Robin Hood walk'd the forest along,</L>
<L>It was in the midst of the day;</L>
<L>There was he aware of a daft young man,</L>
<L>As ever did walk on the way.</L>
<L>His doublet was of sine silk, he said,</L>
<L>His stockings like scarlot shone,</L>
<L>And he walk'd on the way,</L>
<L>To Robin Hood then unknown.</L>
<L>A herd of deer was in the bond,</L>
<L>Feeding before his face;</L>
<L>The best of you I'll have at my dinner,</L>
<L>And in a little space.</L>
<L>The stranger made no mickle ado,</L>
<L>But bent a right good bow,</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="037827_0044_100F810B201EA800"/>
The best buck in the herd he slew,</L>
<L>Forty good feet him fro.</L>
<L>Well shot, well shot Robin Hood,</L>
<L>That shot it was in time;</L>
<L>And if thou wilt accept of the place,</L>
<L>Thou shalt be a yeoman of mine,</L>
<L>Go play the chiven, the strager said,</L>
<L>Make hast and quickly go,</L>
<L>Or with my fist. be sure of this,</L>
<L>I'll give thee buffets store.</L>
<L>Buffet not me, quoth Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Altho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am forlorn;</L>
<L>Yet I have those to take my part,</L>
<L>If I but blow my horn.</L>
<L>Wind not thy horn, the stranger said,</L>
<L>Be thou ne'er so much in haste,</L>
<L>For I can draw a good broad sword.</L>
<L>And quickly cut the blast,</L>
<L>Let's take our swords and broad bucklers,</L>
<L>And gang under yonder green tree;</L>
<L>And I hope to be sav'd, the stranger said,</L>
<L>That shall be better quit.</L>
<L>The stranger drew a good broad sword,</L>
<L>Hit Robin Hood on the crown:</L>
<L>That from every hair of Robin's head,</L>
<L>'The blood ran trickling down.</L>
<L>Crave mercy, good fellow, quoth Robin Hood,</L>
<L>And for this thou hast done,</L>
<L>Tell me good fellow, now what thou art,</L>
<L>Tell me wherein thou dost won.</L>
<L>The strager answer'd bold Robin Hood,</L>
<L>I'll tell thee where I dwell;</L>
<L>In Maxwell I was bred and born,</L>
<L>My name is young Gamwell.</L>
<L>For killing of my father's steward,</L>

Am fore'd to the English wood,</L>
<L>And for to seek an uncle of mine,</L>
<L>Some call him Robin Hood.</L>
<L>But art thou a cousin of Robin Hood's then!</L>
<L>The sooner we shall have done,</L>
<L>The stranger then said, as I hope to be say'd,</L>
<L>I am his own sister's son,</L>
<L>But O! what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issing and courting was there,</L>
<L>When these two cousins did meet;</L>
<L>And they went all that summer's day,</L>
<L>And little John did not meet:</L>
<L>But when they met with little John,</L>
<L>He there unto them did say,</L>
<L>O master, O master where have you been?</L>
<L>You tarried so long away.</L>
<L>I met with a stranger, quoth Robin Hood then?</L>
<L>Full sore he hath beaten me,</L>
<L>Then I'll have about with him, quoth little John</L>
<L>And try if he can be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t me.</L>
<L>O no, O no, quoth Robin Hood then,</L>
<L>Little John that may not be so,</L>
<L>For he's my own dear sister's son,</L>
<L>And cousins I have no more.</L>
<L>And he shall be a yeoman of mine,</L>

<L>And I Robin Hood, and thou little John,</L>

<L>Robin took his mantel from his back,</L>

<L>A present to the Queen.</L>
<L>He clothed his men in Lincoln green.</L>

<L>He let his arrows fly.</L>
<L>And when the court it ended was,</L>
<L>Bold Robin won it with a grace,</L>
<L>Ant after the King was angry with him,</L>
<L>And vow'd he would him chase.</L>
<L>What though his pardon granted was,</L>
<L>While he with him did stay,</L>
<L>But yet the King was vex'd with him,</L>
<L>When he was gone his way.</L>
<L>After from court the King did hie,</L>
<L>In a furious angry mood,</L>
<L>And often enquir'd both far and near,</L>
<L>After bold Robin Hood?</L>
<L>But when the King to Nottingham came,</L>
<L>Robin Hood was in the wood:</L>

<L>Who can find bold Robin Hood.</L>
<L>But when bold Robin Hood he did hear,</L>
<L>The King had him in chase.</L>

<L>But could not him come nigh.</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="037827_0053_100F812584FC4E60"/>

<L>And went straight to Newcastle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a</L>

<L>And then he for Berwich was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne.</L>
<L>When the King he did see how Robin did flee,</L>
<L>He was vexed wond'rous sore,</L>
<L>With a hoop and a hollow, he vowed for to follow.</L>
<L>To take him, or never give o'er.</L>
<L>Come now let's away, then said little John,</L>
<L>Let any man follow that dare:</L>

<L>And from the wood is gone,</L>
<L>Like to a fryar bold Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Was accoutered in his array,</L>
<L>With hood, gown, beads and crucifix,</L>

<L>Bendicte, then said Robin Hood,</L>

<L>Cross you my hand with a single groat,</L>
<L>For our dear Lady's sake.</L>
<L>For I have ben wandering all this day,</L>

<L>Now by our dame, the priest reply'd,</L>
<L>We never a penny have,</L>
<L>For this morning we have been robb'd,</L>
<L>And could no money save.</L>
<L>I am much afraid, said bold Robin Hood,</L>
<L>That you both tell a lie:</L>
<L>And now before you do go hence,</L>
<L>I am resolv'd to try.</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood laid hold on them both,</L>

<L>O spare us, fryar, the priests cry'd out,</L>
<L>On us have some remorse,</L>
<L>You say'd you'd no money, quoth Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Therefore without delay,</L>

<L><PB N="57" REF="037827_0056_100F812F422BDCC8"/>
The priests they could not now gain-say,</L>
<L>But down they kneel'd with speed;</L>
<L>Send us, oh send us, then quoth they,</L>
<L>Some money, to serve our need.</L>
<L>The priests did pray with mournful cheer,</L>
<L>Sometimes their bands they wrung,</L>
<L>Sometimes they wept and wrung their hands,</L>
<L>Whilst merrily Robin sung.</L>
<L>When they had been praying an hour's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce,</L>
<L>The priests did still lament,</L>
<L>Then quoth bold Robin, now let us see,</L>
<L>What money heaven has sent.</L>
<L>We will be tharers all alike,</L>
<L>Of money that we have:</L>
<L>And there is never one of us</L>

<L>He gave them fifty pounds a-piece,</L>

<L>When Robin Hood in the Greenwood stood</L>

That Will Stutely surprised was,</L>
<L>And eke in prison say,</L>
<L>Three variets which the King had hir'd,</L>
<L>Did likewise him betray.</L>
<L>Aye, and to-morryw hang'd must be,</L>
<L>To-morrow a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n as it's day.</L>
<L>But before they could this victory get,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tely did two of them slay.</L>
<L>When Robin Hood heard this news,</L>
<L>Oh he was grieved sore;</L>
<L>Aye, and to his merry men said,</L>
<L>Who altogether swore,</L>
<L>That Will Stutely should rescued be,</L>
<L>And be brought back again;</L>
<L>Or else should many a gallant right</L>
<L>For his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke there be slain.</L>
<L>He cloath'd himself in scarlet then,</L>
<L>His men were all in green;</L>
<L>A fairer sight throughout the world,</L>
<L>In no part could be seen.</L>
<L>Good sir, it was a gallant fight,</L>
<L>To see them on a row,</L>
<L>With every man a good broad sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd,</L>
<L>And eke a good yew bow.</L>
<L>Forth of the greenwood they are gone,</L>
<L>Yea all courageously,</L>
<L>Resolving to bring Stutely home,</L>
<L>Or every man to die.</L>
<L>When they came to the castle near,</L>
<L>Wherein Will Stutely lay;</L>
<L>I hold it good, said Robin Hood,</L>
<L>We here in ambush stay.</L>
<L>And send one forth some news to hear,</L>
<L>To yonder P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmer fair,</L>
<L>That stands under the castle wall,</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="037827_0059_100F81387792FD60"/>
Some news he may declare.</L>
<L>With that steps forth a brave young man,</L>
<L>Which was of courage bold:</L>
<L>Thus did he to the old man say,</L>
<L>I pray the Palmer old,</L>
<L>Tell me if that thou rightly ken,</L>
<L>When must Will Stutely die?</L>
<L>Who's one of bold Robin Hood's men,</L>
<L>And here doth prisoner lie.</L>
<L>Alas! alas! the Palmer said,</L>
<L>And forever woe is me,</L>
<L>Will Stutely hang'd must be this day,</L>
<L>On yonder gallows tree.</L>
<L>Oh had his noble master known,</L>
<L>He would some succour seed,</L>
<L>A few of his bold yeoman dree</L>
<L>Full soon would him befriend.</L>
<L>Aye, that is true the young man said,</L>
<L>Aye, that is true, said he;</L>
<L>Or if they were near to this place,</L>
<L>They soon would set him free.</L>
<L>But fare-thee well thou good old man,</L>
<L>Farewell, and thanks to thee:</L>
<L>If Stutely hanged be this day,</L>
<L>Reveng'd his death shall be.</L>
<L>He was no sooner from the Palmer gone,</L>
<L>The gates were open'd wide,</L>
<L>And out of the castle Will Stutely came</L>
<L>Guarded on every side.</L>
<L>When be forth of the castle come,</L>
<L>And saw no help was nigh,</L>
<L>Thus he did say unto the sheriff,</L>
<L>Thus he said gallantly,</L>
<L>Now seeing that I at last must die,</L>
<L>Grant me but one boon, says he,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="037827_0060_100F813BC5D6D7B0"/>
For my noble master never had a man</L>
<L>That yet was hang'd on a tree,</L>
<L>Give me my sharp sword in my hand,</L>
<L>And let me be unbound,</L>
<L>And with thee and thy men I'll fight,</L>
<L>Till I die on the ground.</L>
<L>But this desire he would not grant,</L>
<L>His wishes were in vain;</L>
<L>For the sheriff had sworn he hang'd should be.</L>
<L>And not by the sword be slain,</L>
<L>Do but unhind my hands he said,</L>
<L>I will no weapon crave,</L>
<L>And if I hanged be this day,</L>
<L>A whipping let me have!</L>
<L>Oh no! oh no! the sheriff said,</L>
<L>On the gallows thou shalt die;</L>
<L>Aye, and thy master too,</L>
<L>If in my power doth lie!</L>
<L>Oh dastard coward, Stutely he cries,</L>
<L>Faint hearted peasant slave.</L>
<L>If ever my master do thee meet,</L>
<L>Thou shalt thy payment have.</L>
<L>My noble master thee doth scorn,</L>
<L>And all thy cowardly crew;</L>
<L>Such silly imps unable are,</L>
<L>Bold Robin to subdue.</L>
<L>But when he was to the gallows come,</L>
<L>And ready to bid adieu,</L>
<L>Out of a bush lept little John,</L>
<L>And stept Wiill Stutely to.</L>
<L>I pray the Will before you die,</L>

<L>I needs must borrow him awhile,</L>

<L>IN Summer time when leaves grow green,</L>

<L>Of a bold out-law call'd Robin Hood,</L>
<L>It is of him I sing this song;</L>
<L>When the lily leaf and cowslip sweet,</L>

And chasing of the fallow deer.</L>
<L>The fisherman brave, more money have,</L>

<L>Therefore I will at Scarborough go,</L>

<L>This out-law call'd his merry men all,</L>
<L>As they sat under the greenwood tree:</L>
<L>If any of you have gold to spend,</L>
<L>I pray you heartily spend it with me.</L>
<L>Now, quoth Robin Hood, I'll to Scarborough go</L>
<L>It seems to be a very sine day;</L>
<L>Who took up his Inn, in a widow womans house,</L>
<L>Hard bye under the waters grey;</L>
<L>Who ask'd of him, where wast thou born</L>
<L>Or tell me where thou dost fare?</L>
<L>I am a poor fisherman said he then,</L>

<L>What is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> name' thou fine fellow,</L>
<L>I pray thee heartily tell me?</L>
<L>In my own counery where I was born,</L>
<L>Men call'd me Simon over-the-lee.</L>
<L>Simon, wilt thou now be my man,</L>
<L>And good round wages I'll give thee?</L>
<L>I have as good a ship of my own,</L>
<L>As any that sails upon the sea.</L>
<L>They pluck'd up anchor and away did sail,</L>
<L>More of days than two or three:</L>
<L>But Simon espy'd a ship of war,</L>
<L>That sail'd to him vigorously.</L>
<L>O woe is me, said the master then,</L>
<L>This day that I was born,</L>
<L>For all the fish that we have got</L>
<L>Is every one lost and forlorn:</L>
<L>For these French robbers on the sea.</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="037827_0064_100F81467977A798"/>
They will not spare, no, not one man,</L>
<L>But c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rry us to the coast of France,</L>
<L>And lay us in a prison strong.</L>
<L>But Simon said, do not fear them,</L>
<L>Nor master take you any care,</L>
<L>Give me my bent bow in my hand,</L>
<L>And ne'er a french man will I spare.</L>
<L>Then straight they boarded the French ship,</L>
<L>The crew lying dead in their sight:</L>
<L>They found within the ship of war,</L>
<L>Twelve thousand pounds in money bright.</L>
<L>One half of the ship, said Simon then,</L>
<L>I'll give to my dame and children small,</L>
<L>The other half of the ship, my friends,</L>
<L>I'll share among you all.</L>
<L>But now bespoke the master then,</L>
<L>Not so, Simon, it shall not be,</L>

<L>Why, who are you, cried bold Robin,</L>

<L>We three belong to King Henry,</L>

<L>If you are keepers of his deer,</L>

<L>So they fell to it full hard and sore,</L>
<L>It was on a midsummer day,</L>
<L>From eight o'clock. till two and past,</L>
<L>They all shew'd gallant play.</L>
<L>There Robin, Will, and little John,</L>
<L>They fought full manfully,</L>
<L>Till all their wind was spent and gone,</L>
<L>Then Robin aloud did cry.</L>
<L>O hold, O hold, cry'd bold Robin,</L>
<L>You be men of valor stout;</L>
<L>Come and go with me to Nottingham,</L>
<L>And there we will fight it out;</L>
<L>With a butt of sack we will bang it abcut,</L>
<L>To see who wins the day,</L>
<L>And for the cost, make you not doubt</L>
<L>I have gold and money to pay:</L>
<L>And ever hereafter so long as we live,</L>
<L>We all will breth'ren be,</L>
<L>For I love those men with heart and hard,</L>
<L>That will fight and never flee</L>
<L>So away they went to Nottingham,</L>
<L>With sack to make amends,</L>
<L>For three days space, they wine did chace,</L>

<L>This is fourth and twenty day,</L>

<L>Then cries the King and Queen likewise,</L>

<L>With that stept out bold Robin Hood,</L>

<L>And for those two Goliahs there,</L>

<L>Crave mercy, quoth Robin, for that blow,</L>
<L>The quarrel shall soon be try'd,</L>

<L>From his shoulders he cut his head,</L>

<L>The giants then began to rage,</L>

<L>A deep and ghastly wound,</L>

<HEAD>XX. Little John and the four Beggars.</HEAD>
<OPENER>TUNE—Robin Hood and the Beggar.</OPENER>
<L>ALL you that delight to spend some time,</L>
<L>With a hey down, and a down,</L>
<L>A merry song for to sing;</L>
<L>Unto me draw near, and you shall hear</L>
<L>How little John went a begging.</L>
<L>As Robin Hood walk'd the forest along,</L>
<L>And all his yeomen dree;</L>
<L>Says Robin, some of you must a begging go,</L>
<L>And little John it must be thee.</L>
<L>Says John, if I must a begging go,</L>
<L>I will have a Palmer's weed;</L>
<L>With a staff and coat, and bags of all sorts,</L>
<L>The better then shall I speed.</L>
<L>Now little John is a begging gone,</L>
<L>Seeking for some relief;</L>
<L>But of all the beggars he met on the way,</L>
<L>Little John he was the chief.</L>
<L>But as he was walking himself alone,</L>
<L>Four beggars he chanced to spy,</L>
<L>Some deaf, some blind, and some came behind,</L>
<L>Says John, here's brave company.</L>
<L>Good-morrow, said John, my brethren dear,</L>
<L>Good fortune I had to see;</L>
<L>Which way do you go? pray let me know,</L>
<L>For I want some company.</L>
<L>Stand thee back thou crooked carl,</L>
<L>And take that knock on the crown;</L>
<L>Nay, said little John, I'll not yet begone,</L>
<L>For a bout I will have with you round.</L>
<L>John nipp'd the dumb, and made them roar,</L>
<L>And the blind that could not see;</L>
<L>And he that had been cripple seven years,</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="037827_0076_100F816B704FF738"/>
He made him run faster than he.</L>
<L>Then he got out of the beggar's cloak,</L>
<L>Three hundred pound in gold;</L>
<L>Good fortune had I, said little John,</L>
<L>Such a good sight to behold.</L>
<L>And you begging trade I will give o'er,</L>
<L>My fortune hath been so good,</L>
<L>Therefore I'll not stay, but I will away</L>
<L>To the forest of merry Sherwood.</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood took little John by the hand,</L>
<L>And dane'd about an oak tree,</L>
<L>If we drink water while this does last,</L>
<L>Then an ill death may I die</L>

<L>WHEN Phebus had melted the 'cicles of ice,</L>

<L>And likewise the mountains of snow,</L>
<L>Bold Robin Hood would ramble to see,</L>
<L>To frolic abroad with his bow:</L>
<L>He then did behold a forester bold,</L>
<L>Who cry'd out, friend, whither so fast?</L>
<L>I'm going, quoth Robin, to kill a fat buck,</L>
<L>That my merry men may all feast.</L>
<L>You'd best have a care, said the forester then,</L>
<L>For these are his majesty's deer;</L>
<L>Before you shall shoot, the thing I'll dispute,</L>
<L>For I am head forester here.</L>
<L>Bold Robin be gave him many hard blows,</L>
<L>The other return'd them as fast;</L>
<L>At every stroke their jackets did smoke,</L>

And cudgell'd bold Robin so sore,</L>
<L>That he could not stand, so shaking his head,</L>
<L>He cry'd, let us freely give o'er.</L>
<L>Then Robin Hood set his horn to his mouth,</L>
<L>A blast then he merrily blows;</L>
<L>His yeomen they hear, and soon they appear</L>
<L>A hundred with trusty long bows.</L>
<L>Lo, these are my yeomen, quoth Robin Hood,</L>

<L>A mantle and bow, and a quiver also,</L>
<L>I'll give thee whom I entertain.</L>
<L>The forester willingly enter'd the list,</L>
<L>They were such a beautiful sight;</L>
<L>Then with a long bow they shot a fat doe,</L>
<L>And made a rich supper that night.</L>
<L>What singing and dancing was in the Greenwood</L>
<L>For joy of another new mate;</L>
<L>With mirth and delight they spent the long night,</L>
