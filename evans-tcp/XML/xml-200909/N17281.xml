<P>☞ AT a time when public credit is sunk very low, and our highest Rulers are loudly complained of, all men among us may justly be alarmed; for a Government divided against itself, is brought to deso∣lation; and every city or house divided against itself, shall not stand. And God says, Them that honor me, I will honor, and they who despise me, shall be lightly esteemed. And as the gospel ministry, and its free support, are the chief means of glorifying God in the world, it is hoped that the following attempt to promote the same, will be candidly received.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>1 COR. ix. 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is as plain an ordinance of God as any he ever instituted; and it is as dis∣tinct from the ordinances of men, as heaven is from earth. The ordinances of men, enforced by the sword, are to defend the persons and property of all impartially, and to punish such as work ill to their neighbours; but the ordi∣nances of the gospel are for begetting and pro∣moting faith and love in the souls of men, so as to act towards God and their neighbours from heavenly motives. Therefore pure religion is an infinite blessing to mankind; and false pretences to it, produce infinite mischiefs. This hath been experienced in all ages, and in all countries. Fear and love are the great principles of human actions; but they were divided by the fall, and the devil hath held men in bondage through fear of death. And nothing can unite these two principles, but faith in the death and merits of Christ, our great high priest and king in heaven. His kingdom is not of this world, and therefore the world have no right to use force about his ministers. This will more fully appear, if we consider what the gospel is, who are the true preachers of it, and what is intended by living of the gospel.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="022322_0004_0FB7FB2268E74870"/>
1. What is the gospel? It is a pure revela∣tion from God, of salvation through his Son, by the power of the Holy Ghost. It is by the seed of the woman, who hath bruised the serpent's head. Truth and love form the character of Christ and his children; and deceit and cruelty form the character of the devil and his children; and God hath put <HI>enmity</HI> between them. Gen. iii. 15. This appeared in the old world between Cain and Abel; and between the seed of Cain and the seed of Seth. After the flood the church descended in the line of Shem, until Abraham was called out of Chal∣dea, and received the promise of the descent of the church in his seed, until Christ came, in whom all the families of the earth should be blessed. And when he received the <HI>bloody</HI> sign of circum∣cision, it was a <HI>seal</HI> to him of the righteousness of the faith which he before had in Christ, who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. Rom. iv. 11 —23. Gal. iii. 10—22. Circumcision was a type of the death of Christ, and of a change of heart by his word and spirit. Therefore he said of the remnant who are saved, The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul, that thou mayst live.—The word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayst do it. And an inspired apostle says, That is the word of faith which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteous∣ness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Deut. xxx. 6—14. Rom. x. 6—10.
<PB N="5" REF="022322_0005_0FB7FB2389671AC0"/>Abraham had no right to circumcise any person that was not born in his house, until he had bought him as servant with money; and he was an emi∣nent type of the Son of God, who purchased the church with his own blood. Therefore the gos∣pel says, Awake, awake, put on strength, O Zion, put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.— Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion: for thus saith the Lord, Ye have sold yourselves for nought, and ye shall be redeemed without money. How beauti∣ful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth sal∣vation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth? Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Isaiah lii. 1—3, 7. Rom. x. 15—17. And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. Bodily exercise profiteth little; but god∣liness is profitable unto all things, having pro∣mise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 1 Tim. iii. 16. iv. 8. Every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. John iii. 20, 21. The gospel is a pure re∣velation from God, which the angels saw more of when God was manifest in the flesh, than they ever did before; and the promises of grace belong
<PB N="6" REF="022322_0006_0FB7FB25E8B40370"/>only to those who believe in and obey the Son of God. We come therefore to inquire,</P>
<P N="2">II. Who are the true preachers of the gospel. In the <HI>first</HI> place, they are all <HI>taught of God,</HI> with∣out which no man can come to his Son. John vi. 44, 45. When he came as the light of the world, none received him but they who were <HI>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI> John i. 9—14. No man can say that Jesus Christ is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 1 Cor. xii. 3. If any man have not the <HI>Spirit of Christ</HI> he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9. Without it he is not a Christian, but a blind leader of the blind. He who hath not a single eye to God, to learn and do his will, is full of darkness. Matt. vi. 21—23. An evil bias blinds the eyes of the wise, and perverts the words of the righte∣ous; and how much more the unrighteous, who were never born again? In the <HI>second</HI> place, all true ministers of Christ, receive special gifts from him, for the great work to which they are called. A good natural capacity for teaching, and human learning and accomplishments; especially a good acquaintance with language, and with the best methods of conveying our ideas to others, are of great importance in these affairs. Yet all these, without an honest heart, enable men to do the more mischief, both in the world, and in the church of God. Therefore we read of the slight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, in the same chapter which as∣sures us, that our ascended Lord gives gifts for pastors and teachers, who <HI>speak the truth in love.</HI> Eph. iv. 11—16. In the <HI>third</HI> place, the apostle Peter says, As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good
<PB N="7" REF="022322_0007_0FB7FB2B0597A7E8"/>stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ. The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but will∣ingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Likewise ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder: yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble. 1 Peter iv. 10, 11. v. 1—5. Here we may see, that all true ministers of Christ, are regenerate persons, and have re∣ceived special gifts from him for that work, with a command to be faithful stewards thereof, as they can answer it to him in the great day. They are leaders in the church, who are all to act as a unit∣ed community, and to be subject one to another, as they would expect the <HI>grace</HI> of God to direct and assist them, and not to be <HI>resisted</HI> by him, as all the <HI>proud</HI> are. The name <HI>Clergy,</HI> which min∣isters have arrogated to themselves, came from the word which is here translated <HI>heritage;</HI> and ministers have acted as <HI>lords</HI> over God's heritage, by assuming the power of church government unto themselves, as the priests had under the law, who could turn a king out of the temple. 2 Chron. xxvi. 18. And in this way the mother of harlots
<PB N="8" REF="022322_0008_0FB7FB2FC52E7E08"/>hath reigned over the kings of the earth. Rev. xvii. 18. She hath assumed the power of dispos∣ing of crowns and countries at her pleasure, while she hath claimed a succession of church power from the apostles, which none but ministers could give or take away. America hath been divided, and filled with blood and slavery, from that hellish claim of power. But the Apostle Peter was so far from claiming any such power, that he allows none to be <HI>priests</HI> in the church of Christ, but those who are <HI>born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorrupt∣ible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever.</HI> And to this royal priesthood, and holy nation, he says, <HI>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake.</HI> 1 Peter i. 23. ii. 9—13. But when men invaded the prerogative of the Lord Jesus Christ, he and John said, <HI>Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto you, more than unto God, judge ye: for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</HI> Acts iv. 19, 20. And John says, <HI>Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil.</HI> 1 John, iii. 9, 10. And when our Lord sent his gospel into the wide field of the world, he commanded his servants to let these two sorts of chil∣dren grow together therein, until he should come to judgment, and cast the wicked into hell, and take his saints to heaven. Matt. xiii. 24—30, 37—43. While he requires his church to exclude all men who are fornicators, or covetous, or idola∣ters, or railers, or drunkards, or extortioners, from their communion. Purging out these evils, is the antitype of putting away all <HI>leavened bread</HI> out of their houses, in the time of the passover. 1 Cor. v.
<PB N="9" REF="022322_0009_0FB7FB354E53B598"/>7—13. But by <HI>confounding</HI> church and world to∣gether, the holy government which Christ ap∣pointed in his church, hath been long trodden un∣der foot. This will more plainly appear, if we consider,</P>
<P N="3">III. What is intended by living of the gospel. As Jesus Christ is the only HEAD of his church, all the ordinances and commandments of men therein, is <HI>will-worship.</HI> And his command to his church is, Whatsoever ye do, in word or deed, do all <HI>in the name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Col. ii. 10, 19—23. iii. 17. Covetous men, who privily brought in damnable heresies, were <HI>self-willed,</HI> under the name of <HI>liberty.</HI> 2 Peter, ii. 1—3, 10, 19. They sinned <HI>wilfully</HI> against the laws, blood and spirit of Christ. Heb. x. 26—29. And all such use <HI>force</HI> to support religious teachers, or else they refuse to support them any further than suits their inclina∣tions. Men who love self above God and their neighbours, heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they turn away their ears from the truth, and are turned unto fables. 2 Tim. iii. 1—5, iv. 1—4. But God said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's of∣fice for every thing of the altar, and within the vail, and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift; and the stranger that cometh nigh, shall be put to death. And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them, by reason of the <HI>anointing,</HI> and to thy sons by an ordinance forever. Numb. xviii. 7, 8. The ointment with which they were anointed, was of such a sacred composition, that
<PB N="10" REF="022322_0010_0FB7FB3646F4BB30"/>God said, Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people, Exod. xxx. 38. But the holy Spirit, wherewith Christ and his saints are <HI>anointed,</HI> is infinitely more sacred. It brings souls to know the <HI>truth,</HI> and that <HI>no lie is of the truth.</HI> All <HI>deceit</HI> is of the <HI>spirit of antichrist.</HI> 1 John, ii. 20—27. And if it were not for that spirit, the laws of Christ would be plain, which say, Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. Ye have been called unto li∣berty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. They that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the af∣fections and lusts. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sow∣eth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. Gal. v. 13, 24, vi. 2—8. Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine; for the scripture saith, Thou shall not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn; and the labourer is worthy of his reward. 1 Tim. v. 17, 18.</P>
<P>As the gospel is a pure revelation from God, living of the gospel cannot mean a living by the laws of men, enforced by the sword. Neither can it mean, that the bodies of ministers should live
<PB N="11" REF="022322_0011_0FB7FB37DA579760"/>upon spiritual food. To communicate unto them in all <HI>good things,</HI> cannot mean only <HI>good words and fair speeches,</HI> neither can a <HI>reward</HI> for <HI>labour,</HI> mean <HI>alms to the poor.</HI> Yet the world is full of these absurd imaginations. Teaching the fear of God by the precepts of men, hath made them deaf and blind to the voice and light of revelation. But the day is coming, when he says, The deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see cut of obscurity, and out of dark∣ness; the meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy One of Israel: for the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off; that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. Isaiah xxix. 13—21. This prophecy was verified when Christ came in the flesh. Mat. xi. 6, xv. 7—9. And it will have a much more glorious accomplishment, when he shall reign with his saints upon earth. But the glory of that reign is described in such bright figures, that many put it beyond the resurrection of the body. Though, as the coming of Elijah meant the coming of John the Baptist, in the <HI>spirit and power of Elias,</HI> so I believe that the resurrec∣tion of the <HI>souls</HI> of the old martyrs, means the raising of their <HI>spirit and power</HI> in the churches, who would yield to <HI>death,</HI> rather than neglect obe∣dience to the <HI>commandments</HI> of Jesus Christ. Mal. iv. 6. Luke i. 17. Rev. xii. 11, 17. xx. 4—6. The <HI>words</HI> of scripture ought ever to be regarded, <HI>comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 13. But <HI>confounding</HI> natural and spiritual things together, erected mystery Babylon. The Son of
<PB N="12" REF="022322_0012_0FB7FB3953DF95E0"/>God was within the Jewish church, when he warn∣ed her leaders against looking elsewhere for his Kingdom; but he is now at the right hand of the Father, making his people willing by the power of his gospel; and he will strike through kings in the day of his wrath, and wound the heads over many countries. Luke xvii. 21. Acts ii. 29—39. Psalm cx. 1—6. Rev. xix. 11—21. But from the word <HI>within,</HI> many have imagined that they were to fol∣low a rule <HI>within</HI> themselves, above what is writ∣ten. Scornful men of old said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agree∣ment; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. Isaiah xviii. 14—16. To be car∣nally minded is death, and deceit came from hell; and all men who think to secure themselves by their own doings, are in covenant with death, and at agreement with hell. Israel followed after the law of righteousness, but did not attain to it, be∣cause they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the deeds of the law; for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone, as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone, and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him, shall not be <HI>ashamed.</HI> Rom. viii. 6—9.ix. 31—33. Hearing and doing the <HI>sayings</HI> of Christ, is the only way for any to build upon the <HI>Rock.</HI> Mat. vii. 24. All others make lies their refuge. The death of Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles; and says our apostle, Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and for∣eigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the <HI>houshold of God;</HI> and are built upon the foun∣dation
<PB N="13" REF="022322_0013_0FB7FB3AC51E3610"/>of the <HI>apostles</HI> and <HI>prophets,</HI> Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. Eph. ii. 18—22.</P>
<P>The <HI>apostles</HI> are set before the <HI>prophets,</HI> both in the first building of the Christian church, and also in her triumph over Babylon. Rev. xviii. 20. The Hebrew church was constituted of the <HI>houshold of Abraham,</HI> and the Christian church of the <HI>houshold of God.</HI> And as it is <HI>adultery</HI> for a woman to love any others above her husband, and to admit them into his place; so it is for any to call themselves Christians, while they refuse to be governed wholly by the laws of Christ. He is the <HI>first-born</HI> among many brethren. And to enforce his laws, an in∣spired apostle says, Ye <HI>are come</HI> unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of an∣gels, to the general assembly and church of the <HI>first-born,</HI> which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the <HI>new cove∣nant,</HI> and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that ye re∣fuse not HIM THAT SPEAKETH; for if they e∣scaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from HIM THAT SPEAKETH FROM HEAVEN: Whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken
<PB N="14" REF="022322_0014_0FB7FB3C58F2DB28"/>may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, where∣by we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a <HI>consuming fire.</HI> Rom. viii. 28—30. Heb. xii. 22—29. Hag. ii. 6—9. Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? Therefore behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that <HI>steal my words,</HI> eve∣ry one from his neighbour. Jer. xxiii. 29, 30. Thou that preachest a man should not <HI>steal,</HI> dost thou <HI>steal?</HI> thou that sayst a man should not com∣mit <HI>adultery,</HI> dost thou commit <HI>adultery?</HI> thou that abhorrest <HI>idols,</HI> dost thou commit <HI>sacrilege?</HI> Rom. ii. 21, 22. All the treasures of the <HI>first city</HI> which Israel took in Canaan, were <HI>consecrated</HI> unto God; and they could not stand before their ene∣mies, until they put away, in the valley of Achor, the <HI>accursed</HI> practice of <HI>stealing</HI> and <HI>dissimulation</HI> about those <HI>sacred things.</HI> Joshua vi. 19, vii. 11, 26. And when God received believing Gentiles into his church, with his <HI>elect</HI> among the Jews, he made the <HI>valley of Achor</HI> a resting place for them; and he said to the unbelievers, The Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by <HI>another name;</HI> that he who blesseth himself in the earth, shall bless himself in the <HI>God of truth,</HI> and he that sweareth in the earth, shall swear by the <HI>God of truth;</HI> because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. Isaiah lxv. 1, 2, 9—16. And after charging Israel with <HI>playing the harlot,</HI> for going after others for a worldly living, God said, I will allure her, and bring her into the wil∣derness, and speak comfortably unto her; and I will give her her vineyard's from thence, and the <HI>valley of Achor for a door of hope.</HI>—And I will sow
<PB N="15" REF="022322_0015_0FB7FB3F6CD2B370"/>her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy, and I will say to them who were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God. Hosea ii. 5, 14, 15, 23. And these prophecies are expressly applied to souls who were effectually <HI>called,</HI> from among Jews and Gentiles. Rom. ix. 24—26, x. 20, 21. To those who were <HI>born again.</HI> 1 Peter, i. 23, ii. 9, 10. All <HI>Christians</HI> have the <HI>Spirit of truth, who will guide them into all truth.</HI> John xvi. 13. And to distinguish the disciples of Christ by any <HI>name</HI> which men have invented, is a <HI>carnal</HI> practice. 1 Cor. iii. 3. When the Jews were carried into Babylon, the command was, Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattereth Is∣rael, will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock. In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. But every one shall die for his own iniquity, every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a <HI>new covenant</HI> with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; <HI>not according to the cove∣nant</HI> that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt (which my covenant they break, although I was an <HI>husband</HI> unto them, saith the Lord:) but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their <HI>inward parts,</HI> and write it in their <HI>hearts,</HI> and I <HI>will</HI> be their God, and they <HI>shall</HI> be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord;
<PB N="16" REF="022322_0016_0FB7FB457A5643E0"/>for they shall <HI>all know me,</HI> from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. Jer. xxxi. 10, 29—34. Upon which an inspired apostle says, In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vanish away. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. Heb. viii. 8—13, x. 9. Circumcision in the flesh, was the first covenant with Abraham and his seed, and circumcision in the heart is the second. And when the martyr Stephen was accused of holding that Jesus of Naz∣areth would destroy their temple at Jerusalem, and change the customs which Moses delivered unto Israel, he recited many facts concerning their na∣tion, and then said, The most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the pro∣phet, Heaven is my throne, and earth is my foot∣stool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord; or what is the place of my rest? hath not my hand made all these things? Ye stiffnecked, and <HI>uncir∣cumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost:</HI> as your fathers did, so do ye. Acts vii. 8, 48—51. In the prophecy referred to, God says, <HI>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.</HI> And concerning Jews and Gentiles, he says, I will take of them for <HI>priests,</HI> and for <HI>Levites,</HI> saith the Lord. For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name re∣main. Isaiah lxvi. 1, 2, 21, 22.</P>
<P>Now we are to remember, that the seed of Aaron, and all the tribe of Levi, were <HI>hallowed</HI> to God, in the room of all the <HI>first-born</HI> in Israel. None
<PB N="17" REF="022322_0017_0FB7FB46D0B1A6B0"/>but the lawful seed of Aaron were priests, to make atonement for sin; and that was not to be done for any <HI>presumptuous</HI> man. Every man also who should act <HI>presumptuously,</HI> against the sentence of their priest and judge, in the place of God's sanc∣tuary, was to die without mercy. Num. iii. 1—13. xv. 30. Deut. xvii. 8—12. The priest was to give sentence in such cases, by the Urim and Thummim; but these were lost in the Babylonian captivity; after which no priest was allowed to eat of the <HI>most holy things,</HI> who could not shew a <HI>register</HI> of his lawful descent from Aaron, until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim. Ezra ii. 61—63. The words signify <HI>light and perfection.</HI> The ark of the testimony, the mercy-seat, the cloud of glo∣ry thereon, with the fire from heaven upon the altar, were also lost in the Babylonian captivity; but the <HI>spirit</HI> of them all was restored by Jesus, <HI>who through the eternal Spirit, offered himself with∣out spot to God, to purge our consciences from dead works to serve the living God. We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat, which serve the tabernacle. By him therefore let us offer the sacri∣fice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. But to do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with such sacri∣fices God is well pleased.</HI> Christ is of an <HI>order</HI> above Levi or Abraham, whose covenants he hath <HI>disan∣nulled.</HI> Heb. vii. 1—22. ix. 14. xiii. 10—16. And the great apostle of the Gentiles says, We are not sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves, but all our sufficiency is of God; who also hath made us able ministers of the <HI>new testa∣ment,</HI> not of the <HI>letter,</HI> but of the <HI>spirit;</HI> for the letter <HI>killeth,</HI> but the spirit <HI>giveth life.</HI> 2 Cor. iii. 5, 6. So our Lord says, It is the <HI>Spirit</HI> that quickneth,
<PB N="18" REF="022322_0018_0FB7FB4843DBB390"/>the <HI>flesh</HI> profiteth nothing: the <HI>words</HI> that I speak unto you, they are <HI>spirit,</HI> and they are <HI>life.</HI> John vi. 63. And they who are thus quickned, are the only church of the <HI>first-born,</HI> under the gospel. All the <HI>first-fruits</HI> in Israel, were also consecrated unto God. Exod. xxii. 29. Therefore another apostle says, Of his own will begat he us with the <HI>word of truth,</HI> that we should be a kind of <HI>first-fruits</HI> of his creatures. James i. 18. The sovereign will of God is the cause, the word of truth is the means, and an intire devotedness to God is the end of the gospel dispensation.</P>
<P>From Abraham unto the death of Christ, pecu∣liar religious privileges were confined to certain families. Even the preaching of the gospel was limited to the <HI>house of Israel,</HI> which is now free for <HI>all nations.</HI> Matt. x. 6. xxviii. 19. Therefore none have any reason to say, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge; for all the privileges of the covenant of grace are personal, as they were not before the death of Christ. Lot was a righteous man, as well as Abraham; but the Israelites were not allowed to invade the possessions of the children of Lot, nor to receive them into the church of God. Deut. ii. 17.—19. Num. xxiii. 9. The first son of Abra∣ham was cast out of the church, for <HI>mocking</HI> at the joy of faith; and the unregenerate do the like to this day. Gen. xxi. 8—12. Gal. iv.22—29. Esau <HI>profanely</HI> sold his birthright; and he found no place of <HI>repentance</HI> afterwards. And the <HI>envy</HI> of his pos∣terity brought ruin upon their country, while <HI>elect∣ing love</HI> continued with a <HI>remnant</HI> of the seed of Jacob. Gen. xxv. 29—34.xxvii. 38. Heb. xii. 16, 17. Ezek. xxxv. 11. Mal. i. 2, 3. Rom. ix. 7—13. xi. 5. And in the church of Israel, Reu∣ben
<PB N="19" REF="022322_0019_0FB7FB4B430BE458"/>lost his birthright, by defiling his father's bed; and some of his tribe perished in the gainsaying of Korah. Gen. xlix. 3, 4. Num. xvi. 1—3. The birthright was Joseph's, who did wonders in Egypt, and Joshua led Israel into Canaan; yet, because Ephraim became the head of an idolatrous king∣dom, they were <HI>divorced,</HI> and never returned from captivity as a nation, but only as individuals. And though Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; yet the <HI>crown</HI> was taken from the house of David, for their wickedness, and was not restored until Jesus came to wear it. And for rejecting him, the Jews will be of the synagogue of satan, until they shall come to be∣lieve in Christ, and to <HI>know his love to his church.</HI> 1 Chron. v. 1, 2. Jer. iii. 8. Ezek. xxi. 25—27. Luke i. 31—33. Rev. iii. 9. The Hebrew and Christian churches, are the two candlesticks, into which God poured the oil of his grace, by his pre∣cepts to direct their way, and by his promises to support their souls, in holding up light to the world, who hate it, because it torments their con∣sciences. The writings of Moses are the only records that any men have of the first creation, of the primitive state of man, of his fall, and of the promises of grace to the fathers, from Adam to his time. And the law of Moses was given, to expose the nature and infinite evil of sin, and to point sin∣ners to the Son of God, who only can save from the guilt and power of it. Therefore the inspired apostle of the Gentiles says, The law entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin abound∣ed, grace did much more abound: that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. And to guard against the ima∣gination,
<PB N="20" REF="022322_0020_0FB7FB4EC066A940"/>that free salvation by grace, would en∣courage men to continue in sin, he said, To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness. Rom. v. 20, 21. vi. 1, 16. Christ was made a <HI>curse</HI> for us, that we might <HI>receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</HI> And all men are <HI>bewitched,</HI> who claim the <HI>promises of grace</HI> in any other way. Gal. iii. 1, 10—14. Yet after the power of the devil was broken in the Roman empire, by the power of the gospel, men who were the servants of sin, assumed the place of the Son of God in his church, so as to be lawgivers and judges for all in religious af∣fairs. And as he takes all that is done to his word, and to his saints, as done to himself, he says, He that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, un∣der two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought wor∣thy, who hath <HI>trodden under foot the Son of God!</HI> Heb. x. 28, 29. His person never was trodden under foot; but the <HI>Gentiles</HI> tread the <HI>holy city un∣der foot forty and two months,</HI> while the <HI>beast</HI> con∣tinues, who at last kills the two witnesses. Rev. xi. 2—10. xiii. 5. And as <HI>Lordship</HI> is of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but is excluded from the church of Christ, I take the <HI>holy city</HI> to mean the government of his church, which men have trampled upon. Mark x. 42, 43. Instead of obeying the Lord Jesus Christ, so that his grace might reign through righteousness, un∣godly men turned his grace into lasciviousness, in imitation of Cain, Balaam and Core. Jude 4—11. The way of Cain, was to worship God without faith in the blood of the Lamb, and to kill Abel because God accepted his believing worship, and did not accept Cain's will worship. Heb. xi. 4.
<PB N="21" REF="022322_0021_0FB7FB50876A3568"/>1 John iii. 7—12. The error of Balaam was lov∣ing the world above God, and counselling a king to entice Israel into sin, for an earthly reward. The Midianites who did it, were of the seed of Abra∣ham, as well as the Israelites, but not of that church. A sword was held up before Balaam to warn him of his danger; and he was finally slain with the sword. Gen. xxv. 2. Num. xxii. 31. xxiii. 9. xxxi. 8, 16. And Christ will slay all, with the sword of his mouth, who love the wages of unrighteousness, except they repent. 2 Peter ii. 15, 16. Rev. ii. 14—16. xix. 11—21. Korah raised a rebellion in Israel against the government which God had estab∣lished therein, under Moses and Aaron, who were eminent types of Christ. Num. xvi. 1—3. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your bre∣thren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people. Acts iii. 22, 23. Moses verily was faith∣ful in all his house as a <HI>servant,</HI> for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; but Christ as a <HI>Son</HI> over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and the re∣joicing of the hope firm unto the end. And of the priesthood, it is said, No man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron: so also, Christ glorified not himself, to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec. Heb. iii. 5, 6. v. 4—6. When the first king of Israel pre∣sumed to violate a known command of God, and
<PB N="22" REF="022322_0022_0FB7FB55B15783F8"/>then thought to atone for it by sacrifices, Samuel said unto him, <HI>Rebellion</HI> is as the sin of <HI>witchcraft,</HI> and stubborness is as iniquity and <HI>idolatry:</HI> because thou hast rejected the <HI>word of the Lord,</HI> he hath also rejected thee from being king. 1 Sam. xv. 23. And by such <HI>sorceries</HI> have all nations been <HI>de∣ceived.</HI> Rev. xviii. 23. When kings shall become nursing fathers, and queens nursing mothers to the church of Christ, they will <HI>bow down</HI> to his au∣thority therein. Isaiah xlix. 23. And then we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all <HI>godliness</HI> and <HI>honesty.</HI> But we are commanded to withdraw from perverse disputers, who suppose that <HI>gain</HI> is <HI>godliness.</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 2. vi. 5. And what clearer evidence can we have of this character, than a re∣fusal to allow the church of Christ to be governed wholly by his laws, and to have each soul act in all religious affairs out of a good conscience to∣wards God? He never united the offices of priest and king in any one tribe of Israel. But all souls who are <HI>born again,</HI> are a chosen generation, a <HI>royal priesthood,</HI> an holy nation, a peculiar people; that they should shew forth the praises of him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous light. And to them it is said, So is the will of God, that with welldoing ye may put to silence the <HI>ignorance</HI> of foolish men: as <HI>free,</HI> and not using your <HI>liberty</HI> for a cloak of <HI>maliciousness,</HI> but as the <HI>serv∣ants of God.</HI> 1 Peter i. 23. ii. 9—16. All persons who are washed in the blood of Christ, are made <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>priests</HI> unto God and his Father, and they shall reign on the earth. Rev. i. 5, 6. v. 10. And who will dare to oppose the reign of Christ with his saints! Men who love themselves above God and their neighbours, are ever <HI>learning,</HI> and never <HI>able</HI> to come to the <HI>knowledge of the truth.</HI> There∣fore
<PB N="23" REF="022322_0023_0FB7FB5AC0AB2098"/>the apostle Paul said to Timothy, Continue thou in the things which thou hast <HI>learned</HI> and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast <HI>learned</HI> them; and that from a child thou hast known the <HI>holy scriptures,</HI> which are <HI>able</HI> to make thee wise unto salvation; <HI>through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</HI> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be <HI>perfect,</HI> throughly furnished unto all good works. 2 Tim. iii. 1—7, 14—17. And the apostle Peter, when speaking of the longsuffering of God with sinners, and of the new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, says of the writings of his beloved brother Paul, In which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are <HI>unlearned</HI> and <HI>unstable wrest,</HI> as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. a Peter iii. 15, 16.</P>
<P>All men who love self above God and their neighbours, are unlearned and unstable, and are not able to come to the knowledge of the truth, let them have ever so great human accomplish∣ments. No man <HI>can</HI> come to Christ, but he who hath <HI>learned</HI> of the Father. John vi. 44, 45. How earnest then should each one be, to be <HI>taught of God?</HI> For Jesus says, All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and <HI>learn</HI> of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Matt. xi. 27—30. His yoke is
<PB N="24" REF="022322_0024_0FB7FB5C9C990B80"/>the covenant of grace, wherein he says, I will put my <HI>laws</HI> into their <HI>mind,</HI> and write them in their <HI>hearts;</HI> and I <HI>will</HI> be their God, and they <HI>shall</HI> be my people. Heb. viii. 10. Which is as much above the covenant of circumcision, as Sarah was above Hagar, or as Jerusalem which <HI>is above,</HI> and is <HI>free,</HI> is superior to men who are in the <HI>bondage of corrup∣tion.</HI> Gal. iv. 25, 26. Rom. viii. 16—21. The pure gospel commission was given to the <HI>eleven,</HI> who were all regenerate persons; to whom Jesus said, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye therefore and teach all nations, bap∣tizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have <HI>commanded</HI> you; and lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world. Amen. Mat. xxviii. 16—20. No man who is not born again, so as to love Christ, and to observe all his commandments, has any more right to this promise, than a <HI>thief</HI> has to any pro∣mise of government, which he had stolen out of a public office; or than a <HI>whore</HI> has to support from an honest husband, when she loves and goes after others for a temporal living. In this way the church of Israel <HI>played the harlot.</HI> And God faid, As troops of <HI>robbers</HI> wait for a man, so the com∣pany of priests <HI>murder</HI> in the way by consent; for they commit <HI>lewdness.</HI> Hosea ii. 5—8. vi. 9. Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are <HI>moveable</HI> that thou canst not know them. Prov. v. 6. Abraham hath been set up as the head of the covenant of grace, whose seed were to destroy all the inhabitants of Canaan, when their iniquity should be <HI>full.</HI> But when Israel was required to do it, ten spies said, We be not <HI>able</HI> to go up a∣gainst the people, for they are stronger than we.
<PB N="25" REF="022322_0025_0FB7FB5E04B857F0"/>And above six hundred thousand men laid their carcases in the wilderness, because they would not believe and obey God in that work. And all men who refuse to believe in and obey the Son of God, will fall after the same example of unbelief. Gen. xv. 6, 16. Num. xiii. 31. Heb. iii. 6—11.iv. 11—16. He commands us to mortify our mem∣bers which are upon the earth; fornication, un∣cleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: for which thing's sake the wrath of God cometh on the child∣ren of disobedience. Mark ix. 43—48. Col. iii. 5, 6. But no sooner was Christianity acknowledged by earthly rulers, than idolatry was established by law. And all the world wondered after the beast, who received his power from the devil; and they said, Who is like unto the beast? who is <HI>able</HI> to make war with him? The whore sits upon a <HI>scar∣let-coloured</HI> beast. Rev. xiii. 1—4. xviii. 3—5. And her ways are so <HI>moveable,</HI> that from Abraham she is gone to old Adam, to prove salvation by <HI>works,</HI> and not by <HI>grace.</HI> Sin and death came up∣on all the children of Adam by a <HI>just</HI> sentence of <HI>law;</HI> but righteousness and life came to all be∣lievers by a free <HI>gift of grace.</HI> The judgment was by <HI>one</HI> to condemnation; but the free gift is of <HI>many offences</HI> unto justification. For if by one man's offence, death reigned by one; much more they which receive <HI>abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness,</HI> shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. For as by <HI>one,</HI> man's disobedience, many were <HI>made sinners;</HI> so by the obedience of <HI>one,</HI> shall many be <HI>made righteous.</HI> Rom. v. 12—19. Little child∣ren let no man <HI>deceive</HI> you: <HI>he that doth righteous∣ness, is righteous, even as he is righteous.</HI> 1 John iii. 7. But multitudes are so much deceived, as to
<PB N="26" REF="022322_0026_0FB7FB6347689F28"/>deny that we were <HI>made sinners,</HI> by the offence of Adam, or that we can be <HI>made righteous,</HI> by receiv∣ing the <HI>gift</HI> of Christ's <HI>perfect righteousness.</HI> And the deception is now carried so far, that salvation for all men, by their own doings and sufferings, in time or eternity, is more daringly proclaimed from London and Boston, than it is from Rome. Yea, their scheme includes the salvation of devils also; and are we not in Babylon! No persons in the church of Rome would swear falsely, or commit murder for her interests, without a promise from her ministers of help to get their souls out of <HI>pur∣gatory.</HI> Cruel superstitions were thereby carried to an amazing length. But deceit and cruelty, un∣der religious pretences, hath now brought forth in∣fidelity, and a contempt of revelation, any further than will suit the inclinations of men. A profes∣sion of faith, without a life of holiness, is but a <HI>dead body.</HI> The devils believe that there is <HI>one God,</HI> and they <HI>tremble</HI> before the <HI>Son of God.</HI> James ii. 19—26. Mat. viii. 29. Therefore all men who can make use of the holy scriptures, for worldly purposes, without serving the Son of God with fear, and rejoicing with trembling, have not so much faith as the devils have. Psalm ii. 6—12. Acts iv. 25, 26. Our Lord was crucified by hypocrites and infidels; and his two witnesses are killed and rejoiced over in the same city, which <HI>spiritually</HI> is called Sodom and Egypt. The Sodomites were for defiling all men who came into their city, and Egypt refused to let the church go and serve God, according to his own institutions. And how full is the world of this impurity and tyranny! Rev. xi. 7—10. Pharaoh never claimed a greater power over Israel, than to bind them in all cases whatsoever. And since we have been delivered from the secular

Unto the pure all things are pure; but unto them that are <HI>defiled</HI> and <HI>unbeliev∣ing, is nothing pure.</HI> Titus i. 15.

He also says, Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, say∣ing, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall an∣swer and say unto you, I know you not whence you are: then shall ye begin to say, We have eat∣en and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; DEPART from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the king∣dom of God, and you yourselves <HI>thrust</HI> out.

And the church is the highest judicature upon earth, to de∣termine all religious matters. And says Jesus, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Matt. xviii. 3—18. Therefore when some ministers of the devil had got into the church of Corinth, and intended to destroy the character of the apostle who gathered it, if possible, he refused to receive any support from thence, until he could come and have the matter tried by that church, according to the laws of Christ. But as a faithful discharge of duty is a great privilege, he said, <HI>Forgive me this wrong.</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 12—15. xii. 13. xiii. 1. But I have known men who were for using <HI>force</HI> in religious matters, that have brought the first of these pas∣sages to prove that it was a mark of the devil's ministers to preach <HI>freely.</HI> And others turn the same argument against all ministers who inculcate

And these opposite parties, in all nations, have bought and sold the faithful, who have been the support of public credit, by which blood and slave∣ry have been carried round the world in galleys and gallant ships. But when the laws of Christ shall be duly executed in his church, they will not be able to strengthen their masts, nor to spread their sails. Then the cry will be heard, Alas! alas! no man buyeth of our merchandise any more! Isai. xxxiii. 20—23. Rev. xviii. 6—20.

False teachers in the Roman empire were the <HI>tail</HI> of the dragon, who crucified Christ, and persecuted all who kept his <HI>commandments.</HI> And the <HI>beast</HI> and the false <HI>prophet,</HI> with the devil who <HI>deceived</HI> them, will be cast into the burning lake together. Rev. xii. 3, 4, 17. xix. 30. xx. 10. And will any men yield to deceit and cruelty any longer! As long as natural birth, or a purchase with money, could bring any into the church, all adulterers and idola∣ters were to die without mercy. Levit. xx. 10. Deut. xiii. 6—11. And covetousness and luxury are adultery and idolatry. Col. iii. 5. Phil. iii. 2, 19. Therefore God says, Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is en∣mity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God. James iv.
<PB N="31" REF="022322_0031_0FB7FB71E3BE92E0"/>4. The builders of Babel said, Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto hea∣ven, and let us make us a <HI>name,</HI> lest we be scat∣tered abroad upon the face of all the earth. Gen. xi. 4. And Babylon has her name from thence; and where is the nation who are not trying to get to heaven by their own works, and to make them∣selves a name upon earth! Yet grievous wolves, and perverse schismatics, have been hold together therein by the sword, directly against the word of God's <HI>grace,</HI> which says, <HI>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</HI> Acts xx. 28—35. It is blessed to receive, when we receive all our comforts from God, as the purchase of the blood of his Son. But it is more blessed to give; because when we do it as faithful stewards, we lay up treasures in <HI>everlast∣ing habitations,</HI> which will be enjoyed with infinite pleasure, when they who had all their <HI>good things</HI> in this life, will not have a drop of water to cool their <HI>tormented tongues.</HI> Luke xvi. 9, 25. They who trust in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; and are ready to distribute, willing to communicate, for the good of others, lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on <HI>eternal life.</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 17—19. Like the olive, the fig tree, and the vine, they esteem the doing of good to their neighbours, above any command over their bodies or estates; while the unbeliever, like the bramble, says, Come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bram∣ble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. Judges ix. 7—15. The tongues of men who would be <HI>many masters,</HI> set on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire of <HI>hell.</HI> James iii. 1—6. Therefore our Lord says, As ye would that men should do to
<PB N="32" REF="022322_0032_0FB7FB75468F61E0"/>you, do ye also to them likewise. For every tree is known by his own fruit; for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-bush gather they grapes. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abun∣dance of the heart his mouth speaketh. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say! Luke vi. 31, 44—46.</P>
<P>How piercing will this question be in the last day to the disobedient! The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? and if the righte∣ous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? I Peter iv. 17, 18. The church is the only house of God upon earth; and it should ever be governed wholly by the revealed <HI>will of God.</HI> And in all expenses, both to the poor, and to support gospel ministers, we should communi∣cate <HI>freely,</HI> out of love to the Son of God, who, though he was rich, yet for our fakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich. And there ought to be an <HI>equality</HI> in the church, as there was in the church of Israel, when they knew that their bread came from heaven every day. 2 Cor. viii. 5—15. Exod. xvi. 18. And how hap∣py should we live, if our hearts and our treasure were in heaven, according to the command of Christ? Luke xii. 14, 22—34. Here he sets a sacred guard against having his church intermed∣dle with the work of civil rulers. And an inspired apostle says, I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer,
<PB N="33" REF="022322_0033_0FB7FB76C79E2648"/>or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one, no not to eat. For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? but them that are without, God judgeth: therefore put away from among your∣selves that wicked person. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged we are chastned of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. I Cor. v. 11—13.xi. 31, 32. And shall we yet <HI>confound</HI> the church with the world, which is mystery Baby∣lon? Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the bal∣ance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. Trust not in <HI>oppression,</HI> and become not vain in <HI>robbery:</HI> if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this, that POWER belongeth unto God. Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth MERCY; for thou renderest to every man according to his work. Psalm lxii. 9—12.</P>
<P>And when will men believe and obey him! In the year 1533, the parliament of England revolted from the church of Rome, and set up their king as head of the church. But they retained the bap∣tisms and laying on of hands, which they received in the church of Rome; and also the bloody prin∣ciples of supporting their worship by force, and of destroying all men who opposed such an exercise of power, as far as they could extend their sword. And Great Britain hath acted upon these princi∣ples, until she is so much lighter than vanity, as scarcely to be able to pay the interest of her nation∣al debt. And though the power and mercy of God delivered America from her tyranny; yet de∣ceit and cruelty is still exercised among us, under religious pretences. The framers of the Massa∣chusetts
<PB N="34" REF="022322_0034_0FB7FB7846DA9F98"/>Constitution, in 1780, opened a door for Roman catholicks to become lawgivers and judges for us, about soul-guides; to justify which, they said to the people, "Your Delegates did not con∣ceive themselves to be vested with power to set up one denomination of Christians above another; for Religion must at all times be a matter between God and individuals." In which they allow men to be Christians, who hold the Pope of Rome to be the head of the universal church upon earth. And though every man who takes a seat in our Legisla∣ture, solemnly swears to renounce all foreign juris∣diction, "civil, <HI>ecclesiastical or spiritual;</HI>" yet ma∣ny ministers are supported by force among us, who hold their succession of Christianity from the church of Rome; all which is as opposite to true Religion, which is ever a matter between God and individu∣als, as Belial is to Jesus Christ. Yea, how can such worship be supported by force, without <HI>perju∣ry!</HI> Christ says, With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. Mat. vii. 2. Great deceit hath been used in New-England, un∣der religious pretences, by different denominations; and how loud are their complaints now against our chief Rulers in America! To love the wages of unrighteousness, is <HI>madness.</HI> 2 Peter ii. 15, 16. This love moved the inhabitants of Munster in Germany, to set up a king as head of their church, and to support their worship with the sword, the same year in which England was guilty of like madness. But because the people of Munster were soon destroyed or enslaved, all men in Europe and America, who have refused to put baptism before a personal profession of faith in Christ, have been re∣proached with the madness of Munster. So the whore
<PB N="35" REF="022322_0035_0FB7FB79E5348170"/>in Egypt, accused Joseph of the crime he avoided, and because he avoided it: But of deceit and cruel∣ty under the mask of Religion, good old Jacob said, O my soul, come not thou into their secret: unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou unit∣ed. Gen. xxxiv. 25—29. xxxix. 17, 18. xlix. 5—7. And Moses says, Their vine is the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of <HI>gall,</HI> their clusters are <HI>bitter.</HI> Their wine is the <HI>poison of dragons,</HI> and the cruel <HI>venom of asps.</HI> To me belongeth <HI>vengeance,</HI> and recompence, their foot shall slide in due time. Deut. xxxii. 32—35. Upon which Paul says, Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things <HI>honest</HI> in the sight of all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, <HI>Vengeance</HI> is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Rom. xii. 17—19. And Peter said to a man who thought to get <HI>power</HI> in the church by <HI>money,</HI> Thou art in the <HI>gall of bitterness,</HI> and in the <HI>bond of iniquity.</HI> Acts viii. 19, 23. <HI>Deceit</HI> is the <HI>poison of asps.</HI> Rom. iii. 13.</P>
<P>And it is as real <HI>robbery</HI> to neglect the <HI>ordinances</HI> of God, as it is to force people to support teach∣ers who will not trust his influence for a temporal living. He <HI>curseth the blessings</HI> of all men who are <HI>partial in the law.</HI> Mal. ii. 2, 9. iii. 7—11. Therefore his faithful watchmen say, Pray for us; for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live <HI>honestly.</HI> Heb. xiii. 18. Officers are never called <HI>priests</HI> in the church of Christ, in distinction from the rest of his children. <HI>Apostles, and elders, and brethren,</HI> was the style of his first church. Acts xv. 23. And one apostle said afterwards, The <HI>elders</HI> which are among you I exhort, who am also an <HI>elder.</HI> 1 Peter v. 1. And
<PB N="36" REF="022322_0036_0FB7FB81A6030888"/>another said, Let the <HI>elders</HI> that rule well, be count∣ed worthy of double honor, especially they who <HI>la∣bour</HI> in the word and doctrine. For—the <HI>labourer</HI> is worthy of his <HI>reward.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 17, 18. Hon∣esty requires a reward for labour, as much as cha∣rity does alms for the poor; and it is Babylonian <HI>confusion</HI> to hold them to be one and the same thing. Our Lord will judge all at last, according to their behaviour in this life towards his members and ministers. Mat. xxv. 31—46. Luke x. 7—16. His ministers are soldiers, as well as labourers. 2. Tim. ii. 3—7. And who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? if we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing, if we shall reap your carnal things? 1 Cor. ix. 7—11. Let each person consider how he can answer these questions to the Son of God, who only can give us safety and happiness, in time or eternity.</P>
