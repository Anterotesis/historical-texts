<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Importance of the liberal education of youth, both to church and state, and the necessity of public schools and colleges for that end, is now so universally acknow∣ledged, as to render an enlargement upon it unnecessary, by way of introduction to the following account. The main design of this publication, is to acquaint the world, with the rise, progress, and present state of the COLLEGE OF NEW-JERSEY, which for some Years past, hath been an Object of public Attention.</P>
<P>THE great disadvantages, this, and the conti∣guous provinces lay under, some years ago, for want of such an institution, are well known. The distance of the british universities, and the expences
<PB N="6" REF="009752_0004_0F7A47DE090D8528"/>
attending an education abroad, were, to the american colonists, insuperable obstacles. The two colleges of <HI>New-England,</HI> and that of <HI>Virginia,</HI> then the only seats of learning, in the wide-extended british empire in America, were too remote from each other, to extend their influence through these intermediate colonies. Hence, in point of litera∣ture, a large tract of a well-peopled country, necessarily lay rude and uncultivated.</P>
<P>AS the colonies encreased, the exigencies of affairs, both of an ecclesiastical and political nature, became more and more urgent. Religious societies were annually formed, in various places; and had they long continued vacant, or been supplied with an ignorant illiterate clergy, christianity itself, in a course of years, might have become extinct among them. Affairs of state also became more embarrassed for want of proper direction, and a competent number of men of letters, to fill the various political offices. The bench, the bar, and seats of legislation, required such accomplishments, as are seldom the spontaneous growth of nature, unimproved by education.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009752_0005_0F7A47E04D3C7168"/>YET, even in this dark period, there were not wanting several gentlemen, both of the civil and sacred character, who, forming a just estimate of the importance of learning, exerted their utmost efforts, to plant and cherish it in the province of <HI>New-Jersey.</HI> After some disappointments and fruitless attempts, application was at length made to his excellency <HI>Jonathan Belcher,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at that time governor of the province, and, in the year 1748, he was pleased, with the approbation of his majesty's council, to grant a CHARTER, incorporating sundry gentlemen of the clergy and laity, to the number of twenty-three, as trustees; investing them with such powers, as were requisite to carry the design into execution, and constituting his majesty's governor for the time being, <HI>ex officio,</HI> their president.</P>
<P>THAT the constitution of this college, is founded upon a free and catholic bottom, and calculated for the equal and general advantage, of every religious denomination of protestants, will clearly appear, by the following extract from this charter; <Q>AND WHEREAS by the fundamental Concessions made at the first Settlement of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> by
<PB N="8" REF="009752_0006_0F7A47E12AA79DE0"/>
the Lord <HI>Berkely</HI> and Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> then Proprietors it was among other things conceded and granted that <HI>no Freemen within the said Province should at any time be molested punished disquieted or called in Question for any Difference of Opinion or Practice in Matters of religious Con∣cernment who do not actually disturb the Peace of the said Province they behaving themselves peace∣ably and quietly and not using this Liberty to Licenciousness nor to the civil Injury or outward Disturbance of others</HI> WHEREFORE and for that the said Petitioners have also expressed their earnest Desire that those of every religious Deno∣mination may have free and equal Liberty and Advantage of Education in the said College any different Sentiments in Religion notwithstanding &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> The world hath here the strongest attestation, of the liberal principles, not only of the government in granting, but also of the petiti∣oners themselves in their application for a charter. The views of the latter, extended to the common benefit, of all their protestant brethren. Indeed, had they been otherwise disposed, the constitution happily disables them, from ever perverting the institution, to any narrow or sinister purposes: For
<PB N="9" REF="009752_0007_0F7A47E1BB38D3E0"/>
the charter further contains the following clause, <Q>And we do further will give and grant unto the Trustees of the said College that they and their Successors or the major part of any thirteen of them which shall convene for that Purpose may make and they are hereby fully empowered to make and establish such Ordinances Orders and Laws as may tend to the good and wholsome Government of the said College and all the Stu∣dents and several Officers and Ministers thereof and to the public Benefit of the same not repug∣nant to the Laws and Statutes of our Realm of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or of this our Province of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> and not excluding any Person of any religious Denomination whatsoever from free and equal Liberty and Advantage of Education or from any of the Liberties Immunities or Privi∣ledges of the said College on Account of his or their being of a religious Profession different from the said Trustees of the said College &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>IF any unfavourable representations, have been any where made of this institution, as an illiberal scheme, contrived to subserve the contracted inte∣rests of a religious party, it manifestly appears,
<PB N="10" REF="009752_0008_0F7A47E8D5AEEF10"/>
from the above view of its fundamental constitu∣tion, that they are untrue and groundless. And, from its management hitherto, which is no secret, it may be affirmed in the face of the world, that the execution has been as fair, impartial, and generous, as the plan upon which it was originally founded.</P>
<P>THUS were the trustees possessed of a naked charter, without any fund at all to accomplish the undertaking. This, in the eyes of some, gave it the appearance of an idle chimerical project. Their only resource, indeed, under the smiles of Heaven, was in the beneficence of the advocates and friends of learning. After various solicitations in <HI>America,</HI> the contributions, tho' often generous and worthy of grateful acknowledgment, were found by no means adequate to the execution of so extensive a design. Therefore, in the year 1753, two gentlemen were sent as agents to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> to solicit additional benefactions. There the institution was honoured, beyond the most sanguine expectations, with the approbation and liberality of several political and ecclesiastical bodies; and of many private persons
<PB N="11" REF="009752_0009_0F7A47E94FE09EF8"/>
of the nobility and gentry, among the laity and clergy of various denominations.</P>
<P>THE students, in the mean time, who, in the beginning, were few in number, lived dispersed in private lodgings, in the town of <HI>Newark;</HI> at which place, the college was first opened; the public academical exercises being generally performed in the county court-house. The difficulties and danger of these circumstances, both with regard to the morals and literary improvement of the youth, could scarcely have been encountered so long, had it not been for the indefatigable industry and vigilance of Mr. PRESIDENT BURR, the first who officiated in that station. And it was much owing to his unremitted zeal and activity, that this college so suddenly rose to such a flourishing condition.</P>
<P>THE trustees, thus generously assisted, imme∣diately set about erecting a building, in which the students might be boarded as well as taught, and live always under the inspection of the college officers, more sequestred from the various tempta∣tions, attending a promiscuous converse with the world, that theatre of folly and dissipation. The
<PB N="12" REF="009752_0010_0F7A47EB841BC200"/>
little village of <HI>Princeton</HI> was fixed upon, as the most convenient situation; being near the center of the colony, on the public road between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and not inferior in the salubrity of its air, to any village upon the conti∣nent.</P>
<P>THE edifice being nearly finished, and con∣sidered as sacred to liberty and revolution-princi∣ples, was denominated NASSAU-HALL, from that great deliverer of <HI>Britain,</HI> and assertor of protestant liberty, K. WILLIAM the IIId, prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Nassau.</HI> It will accommodate about 147 stu∣dents, computing three to a chamber. These are 20 feet square, having two large closets, with a window in each, for retirement. It has also an elegant hall, of genteel workmanship, being a square of near 40 feet, with a neatly finished front gallery. Here is a small, tho' exceeding good organ, which was obtained by a voluntary subscription: Opposite to which, and of the same height, is erected a stage, for the use of the students, in their public exhibitions. It is also ornamented, on one side, with a portrait of his late majesty, at full length; and, on the other,
<PB N="13" REF="009752_0011_0F7A47EC4590F510"/>
with a like picture, (and above it the family-arms neatly carved and gilt,) of his excellency governor BELCHER. These were bequeathed by the latter to this college. The library, which is on the second floor, is a spacious room, furnished at present with about 1200 volumes, all which have been the gifts of the patrons and friends of the institution, both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> There is, on the lower story, a commodious dining hall, large enough to accommodate as many as the house will contain, together with a large kitchen, steward's apartments, &amp;c. The whole structure, which is of durable stone, having a neat cupola on its top, makes a hansome appearance; and is esteemed to be the most conveniently plan'd for the purposes of a college, of any in <HI>North-America;</HI> being designed and executed by that approved architect Mr. <HI>Robert Smith,</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>IN the year 1757, the students, to about the number of 70, removed from <HI>Newark,</HI> the house being then so far completed, as to be ready for their reception. Experience soon taught the society, the superior convenience of their new circumstances. The numbers encreased very fast. The country
<PB N="14" REF="009752_0012_0F7A47ED05517EF8"/>
became more and more convinced of the impor∣tance of learning, in general, and the utility of such a seat of education in particular; both from the regularity of its administration, and the figure which several of its sons already made, in the various literary professions. But it was not long before it suffered, what was then looked upon, as an almost irretrievable loss. For this same year died, universally deplored, Mr. PRESIDENT BURR.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following epitaph, which justly delineates his character, is inscribed on a marble tomb, erected by the college, to his memory.</P>

degree, of such an assemblage of superior talents. He seemed to be peculiarly formed, for that im∣portant sphere of action, which was assigned him in the latter part of his life. But the reader may see the lineaments of his character drawn, in striking colours, by a masterly hand, in a funeral
<PB N="16" REF="009752_0014_0F7A47EE838FFCC0"/>
eulogium, published soon after his decease.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">By WILLIAM LIVINGSTON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></NOTE> The same year died also his excellency governor BELCHER, who continued, to the last, a zealous patron of religion and learning. His library, consisting of 474 volumes, together with several other useful and ornamental articles, he left to this college, of which he was himself the founder.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009752_0015_0F7A47EF4BA8F858"/>THE REV. MR. JONATHAN EDWARDS suc∣ceeded to the presidentship. Great were the ex∣pectations of the public, from the administration of a clergyman of his very distinguished rank in the literary world. But in a few days after his arrival at <HI>Nassau-Hall,</HI> he was seized with a mortal distemper: And it pleased the sovereign of the universe to call him from this stage of action, before he could apply his skilful hand to the work, which his predecessor had so dexterously forwarded.</P>
<P>THUS a vacancy again ensued, which continued near eighteen months; when the Rev. Mr. SAMUEL DAVIES, of <HI>Virginia,</HI> was chosen to the Office: A gentleman, well known on both sides the atlantic; but who was, perhaps, no where more esteemed and beloved than at <HI>Nassau-Hall;</HI> His fine talents, added not a little, to the dignity and reputation of the society, which received many improvements, from his ingenuity and polite taste. The repeated strokes it had lately suffered, in the loss of two such excellent heads, extremely affected the well-wishers to the interests of virtue and literature. But the cloud now seemed to be dispersed, and all things to revive within. For,
<PB N="18" REF="009752_0016_0F7A47F1A465F670"/>
tho', in the vacancy of the chair, there always had been one of the board of trustees, appointed to act, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> yet, it is reasonable to suppose, that as to any new improvements in the education of the youth, matters were, in a great measure, at a stand.—But how uncertain are human things! How precarious the most elevated hopes! In the month of <HI>February,</HI> 1761, this brilliant genius, in the midst of his rising reputation and growing usefulness, suddenly resigned his breath, to the inconsolable grief of the whole society, and universal lamentation of all good men.</P>
<P>SOON after his death, the Rev. Dr. SAMUEL FINLEY, was elected to the president's chair: a gentleman, who for many years, had distin∣guished himself in the management of a private academy at <HI>Nottingham</HI> in <HI>Pensylvania;</HI> and in the month of <HI>July</HI> following, he arrived at NASSAU-HALL, and entered upon his office. As to the hap∣piness of this succession, the present flourishing state of the college, the general diligence of the youth in their literary pursuits, and the internal harmony and good order so observable in the society, are sufficient attestations.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="009752_0017_0F7A47F27A8166D8"/>WE shall now give the world some account of the modes of government and instruction, together with the whole plan of education, the manner and expences of boarding, the circumstances of the fund, and whatever else may be requisite to ex∣hibit a view of the present state of the institution.</P>
<P>IT would be unnecessary and tedious, to trouble the reader, with a minute detail of all the private laws and statutes, which have been made, from time to time, for the better regulation of its members. They are intended, in general, to settle the terms of admission, to prescribe the duties, and adjust the powers of the officers, who are universally accountable to the trustees: and especially to direct the conduct and studies of the youth; and to res∣train them from such liberties and indulgencies, as would tend to corrupt their morals, or alienate their minds from a steady application. In these re∣gulations, it hath been the design to fix upon a me∣dium, between too great a licentiousness on the one hand, or an excessive precision on the other. The penalties are generally of the more humane kind; such as are at once expressive of compassion to the offender, and indignation at the offence; such
<PB N="20" REF="009752_0018_0F7A47F2FA767228"/>
as are adapted to work upon the nobler principles of humanity, and to move the more honourable springs of good order and submission to govern∣ment. The laws indeed authorise the infliction of pecuniary mulcts, according to the practice of other colleges; but they are seldom executed, as it would seem to be punishing the parents for the offences of the children. It cannot be recollected, that there have been above three or four sines imposed, for upwards of three years last past; nor even one, since Dr. FINLEY hath presided. And in those few singular cases, it was done, rather for the sake of variety, as another particular method, of fixing a brand of odium upon a bad action, than as a pe∣cuniary punishment. A small fine will answer that end, as well as a larger.</P>
<P>IN the exercise of discipline, the more usual process is this.—The president or tutors, separately or in conjunction, privately reason with the offender, in order to make him sensible of his ill conduct; and endeavour, by their manner of address, to convince him, that in their proceedings against him, they are actuated from motives of sincere regard to his own welfare, and that their severity is
<PB N="21" REF="009752_0019_0F7A47F9F7279160"/>
not the effect of moroseness, ill-nature, or personal resentment. If the offence charged, be denied, evidences are adduced in proof of it. But if the youth discovers an ingenuous temper, by an open frank acknowledgment, such a disposition is encouraged, by a mitigation of the punishment. On the other hand, all low and dishonest artifices, particularly lying and wilful equivocation, are resented as the highest aggravations. In the result, if found guilty, according to the nature of the offence, he is dismissed either with a private reprimand, or required to submit to a public formal admonition;—or, to make a penitent confession in the hail, before the whole house;— or, deprived of some of the peculiar privileges of his class;—or, for some limited time, pro∣hibited a free conversation with his fellow students, and admission into their chambers, as unworthy of their society;—or, suspended from residence, and all the privileges of the college, until the matter be laid before a committee of six of the trustees. In these several kinds and degrees of punishment, an impartial regard is had, not only to the nature of the offence, but also to the dis∣position, age, rank in college, habitual conduct,
<PB N="22" REF="009752_0020_0F7A47FD106B4710"/>
and other circumstances of the offender. Suspension is the highest censure the president and tutors can inflict. The power of expulsion is vested in any six of the trustees convened; who, having had no connections with the offender, cannot be sus∣pected of prepossession or partiality. It may not be amiss, in this place to remark, that among one hundred and twenty pupils, who, for this year past, have been under the care of the immediate governors of the college, there have been but very few, whose conduct hath rendered them obnoxious even to the milder methods of punishment. This is mentioned, particularly, in due respect to the gentleman who now presides; government being the most difficult and delicate part of the presiden∣tal office. To teach a classic author, or system of philosophy is a much easier task, than to govern a society of youth, in the gay and volatile period of life, when the passions are predominant, and reason but in a forming state; a society, collected from almost all the several colonies on this continent, educated in different manners, with different views, and an endless variety of tempers and circum∣stances. To govern such a society, so as at once to command their veneration, and conciliate their
<PB N="23" REF="009752_0021_0F7A47FD87955C48"/>
love: To grant every innocent liberty, and, at the same time, to restrain from every ensnaring indulgence: To habituate them to subjection, and yet maintain their respective ranks without inso∣lence or servility: To cherish a sense of honour, without self-sufficiency and arrogance: In a word, to inspire them with such principles, and form them to such a conduct, as will prepare for sustain∣ing more extensive connections, with the grand community of mankind; and introduce them on the theatre of the world, as useful servants of their country.—This is the task, the arduous task, of a governor of the college: To which, how few are equal!</P>
<P>AS to the branches of literature taught here, they are the same with those which are made parts of education in the European colleges, save only such, as may be occasioned by the infancy of this institution. The students are divided into four dis∣tinct classes, which are called the <HI>Freshman,</HI> the <HI>Sophomore,</HI> the <HI>Junior,</HI> and the <HI>Senior.</HI> In each of these, they continue one year; giving and receiving, in their turns, those tokens of respect and subjection, which belong to their standings; in order to
<PB N="24" REF="009752_0022_0F7A47FE41AE7350"/>
preserve a due subordination. The <HI>Freshman</HI> year is spent in the latin and greek languages, particularly in reading <HI>Horace, Cicero</HI>'s <HI>Orations,</HI> the <HI>Greek Testa∣ment, Lucian</HI>'s <HI>dialogues,</HI> and <HI>Xenophon</HI>'s <HI>Cyropaedia.</HI> In the <HI>Sophomore</HI> year, they still prosecute the study of the languages, particularly <HI>Homer, Longinus,</HI> &amp;c; and enter upon the sciences, geography, rhetoric, logic, and the mathematics. They continue their mathematical studies throughout the <HI>Junior</HI> year; and also pass through a course of natural and moral philosophy, metaphysics, chronology, &amp;c. and the greater number, especially such as are educating for the service of the church, are initiated into the hebrew. As to this so unhappily unpopular lan∣guage, no constraint is laid upon the youth to the study of it. But it is to be wished, it may soon be more universally esteemed, a useful and important acquisition, as we are told it already is, among the politest literati in <HI>Europe.</HI> It opens an inexhaustible fund of criticism, both to the divine, and the poet. But the reader is referred to Mr. <HI>Addison, Spec.</HI> vol. 6. N. 405, where are displayed the superior beauties of the sacred poesy.—To return, the <HI>Senior</HI> year is entirely employed in reviews and composition. They now revise the most improv∣ing
<PB N="25" REF="009752_0023_0F7A47FF17F5C230"/>
parts of the latin and greek classics, part of the hebrew bible, and all the arts and sciences. The weekly course of disputation is continued, which which was also carried on through the preceeding year. They discuss two or three theses in a week; some in the syllogistic, and others in the forensic manner, alternately; the forensic being always per∣formed in the english tongue. A series of questions is also prepared, on the principal subjects of na∣tural and revealed religion. These are delivered publicly, on sundays, before a promiscuous con∣gregation, as well as the college, in order to habi∣tuate them early to face an assembly, as also for other important and religious ends, to which they are found conducive. There is likewise a monthly oration-day, when harrangues, or orations of their own composition, are pronounced before a mixt auditory. All these compositions before mentioned, are critically examined with respect to the language, orthography, pointing, capitalizing, with the other minutiae, as well as more material properties of accurate writing.</P>
<P>BESIDE these exercises in writing and speaking, most of which are proper to the <HI>Senior</HI> class, on
<PB N="26" REF="009752_0024_0F7A47FFC79E2A30"/>
every monday three, and on the other evenings of the week, excepting saturdays and sundays, two out of each of the three inferior classes, in rotation, pronounce declamations of their own composing, on the stage. These too are previously examined and corrected, and occasion taken from them, early to form a taste for good writing. The same classes also, in rotation, three on tuesday evenings, and two on the other evenings, with the exceptions just mentioned, pronounce, in like manner, such select pieces from <HI>Cicero, Demosthenes, Livy,</HI> and other ancient authors; and from <HI>Shakespear, Milton, Addison,</HI> and such illustrious moderns, as are best adapted to display the various passions, and exem∣plify the graces of utterance and gesture. A good address, and agreeable elocution, are accomplish∣ments so ingratiating, and so necessary to render a public speaker, especially, popular; and conse∣quently useful, that they are esteemed here, as considerable parts of education, in the cultivation of which no little pains are employed.</P>
<P>THE classics are taught, for the three first years, in nearer the usual method of grammar schools, than in the last. The students then
<PB N="27" REF="009752_0025_0F7A48008CCA3350"/>
revise them, principally as examples of fine composition. They first give a more literal trans∣lation of a paragraph, afterwards the sense in a paraphrase of their own, and then criticise upon the beauties of the author: In which work they are assisted by the president. No authors are read more particularly with this view, than <HI>Homer, Horace,</HI> and especially <HI>Longinus</HI>—

<P>EACH class recites twice a day; and have always free access to their teachers, to solve any difficulties that may occur. The bell rings for morning prayer at six o'clock, when the senior class read off a chapter from the original into english. The president then proposes a few critical questions upon it, which, after their concise answers, he illustrates more at large. The times of relaxation from study, are about one hour in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening: And in these are included the public meals. Evening prayer is always introduced with psalmody; and care is taken to improve the youth in the art of sacred music.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="009752_0026_0F7A480143772948"/>THE usual method of instruction in the sciences is this.—The pupils frequently and deliberately read over such a portion of the author, they are studying, on a particular science, as it is judged, they can be able thoroughly to impress upon their memories. When they attend their recitations, the tutor proposes questions on every particular they have been reading. After they have given, in their turns, such answers, as shew their general acquaintance with the subject, he explains it more at large; allows them to propose any difficulties; and takes pains to discover whether his explications be fully comprehended. Advantages, which are seldom attainable, in the usual method of teaching by lecture.</P>
<P>IN the instruction of the youth, care is taken to cherish a spirit of liberty, and free enquiry; and not only to permit, but even encourage their right of private judgment, without presuming to dic∣tate with an air of infallability, or demanding an implicit assent to the decisions of the preceptor.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Senior, Junior,</HI> and (towards the con∣clusion of their year) the <HI>Sophomore</HI> classes, are
<PB N="29" REF="009752_0027_0F7A4801FAB84D88"/>
allowed the free use of the college library, that they may make excursions beyond the limits of their stated studies, into the unbounded and va∣riegated fields of knowledge; and, especially, to assist them in preparing their disputations, and other compositions. But the comparatively small assort∣ment of modern authors, in the library, is one of those remediless disadvantages, this institution must lie under, until its funds will afford an enlargement. The present collection entirely consists of the donations of the charitable, both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> However, should the trustees themselves remain incapable of making additions; it is yet encouraging, that valuable benefactions of this sort are still, now and then received. Gentlemen who are liberally disposed, but know not what books the library is already possessed of, may peruse the catalogue, lately published, for the information of the public in this matter.—</P>
<P>BUT to proceed—On the third <HI>Wednesday</HI> in <HI>August</HI> annually, the <HI>Senior</HI> class are examined by the trustees, the college officers, and other gentle∣men of learning then present, throughout all the branches of literature, they have been here taught.
<PB N="30" REF="009752_0028_0F7A4802C09EDBF8"/>
And if approved, as worthy of academical honours, the president assigns them the parts, they are respectively to perform at the anniversary commencement; the general proceedings of which, are so publicly known, as to superceed all necessity of description. They are then graduated <HI>Bachelors of Arts.</HI> After an interval of three years, they are usually admitted to the <HI>Master</HI>'s degree. But to this latter, the terms of admission, for these few years past, have not been so lax and indetermi∣nate as formerly. In the year 1760, the trustees made a resolve upon this head, which it may not be improper to insert here, as it stands recorded in in the minutes of their proceedings, and is as follows.—</P>
<Q><P>THE conferring academical Honours, was in∣tended as an Incentive to a laudable Ambition in Study, and as a Reward of literary Merit. And the different Degrees of these honorary Distinc∣tions, conferred successively, at different periods, suppose a proportioned Increase of literary Merit; and consequently a sufficient Time of Residence in College, for the further Prosecution of Study; and a proper previous Examination to
<PB N="31" REF="009752_0029_0F7A48050F14B3D8"/>
discover the Improvement of the Candidates. But when promiscuously distributed, as cursory Formalities after the usual Time, without any previous Evidence of suitable Qualifications, they sink into Contempt, as insignificant Cere∣monies; and no longer answer their original Design. Therefore the Trustees determine to admit none to the Degree of <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> but upon the following Terms.</P>
<P>ALL Candidates for a <HI>Master</HI>'s Degree, shall reside in or near the College, at least one Week immediately preceeding that Commencement, at which they expect to receive their Degrees: during which Time, they shall submit to the Laws and Orders of the College: and on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> Morn∣ing, immediately preceeding the last <HI>Wednesday</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> (on which Day the Anniversary Com∣mencement is held,) they shall attend in the Col∣lege, in order to pass such an Examination, as the Trustees, then present, shall think necessary; especially in such Branches of Literature, as have a more direct Connection with that Profession of Life, which they have entered upon, or have in View; whether Divinity, Law, or Physic.
<PB N="32" REF="009752_0030_0F7A4805EC0C7188"/>
And shall make such Preparations for the Com∣mencement, as the Officers of the College shall judge proper.</P>
<P>AS so short a Residence can be an intolerable Inconvenience to but very few, and will render a second Degree a real Honour, the Trustees will not dispense with it in ordinary Cases. Yet as the Circumstances of some Persons, of suffi∣cient Accomplishments, may render them inca∣pable of Residence, they are to inform the Pre∣sident by Letter, some convenient Time before the Commencement, at which they intend to offer themselves Candidates, of the Reasons of their Incapacity, that the Trustees may judge, whe∣ther they are sufficient for a Dispensation for the whole, or any Part of the Time required.</P></Q>
<P>THIS law, as is declared in another place, extends also to the bachelors from other colleges, who stand candidates for a higher degree, than they have yet been admitted to. Graduates from other colleges, upon producing their diplomas, or other sufficient testimonials, are admitted AD EUNDEM, without any previous examination: But
<PB N="33" REF="009752_0031_0F7A48067B10D1B0"/>
then, it is inserted in their diplomas, and publicly declared by the president, to be conferred HONORIS CAUSA, according to the practice of some uni∣versities abroad. And with regard to all.—None are admitted without testimonials of their good moral conduct, while absent, signed by two or more gentlemen of note and veracity, in the place where they have resided; or, unless recom∣mended by one of the trustees, or college officers, from personal knowledge.</P>
<P>AS to admission into the several classes, these are the regulations.—Candidates for admission into the lowest or freshman-class, must be capable of composing grammatical latin, translating <HI>Virgil, Cicero's Orations,</HI> and the four evangelists in greek, and, by a late order, must understand the prin∣cipal rules of vulgar arithmetic. Candidates for any of the higher classes, are not only previously examined, but recite a fortnight upon tryal, in that particular class for which they offer themselves; and are then fixed in that, or a lower, as they happen to be judged qualified: But, unless in very singular and extraordinary cases, none are received after the junior year.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="009752_0032_0F7A480DBAC614E0"/>BESIDE these examinations for admission into the respective classes, and the last examination of the senior class, previous to their obtaining the first collegiate honours; the three inferior classes, at the end of every year, are examined in such of the classics, arts and sciences, as they have studied, in order for admission into the next: And such as are found un∣qualified, are not allowed to rise in the usual course. These, in like manner as the last examination of the senior-class, are attended upon by the presi∣dent and tutors, in conjunction with any other gentlemen of liberal education, who chuse to be present. Dr. <HI>Finley</HI> hath also instituted quarterly examinations of the three classes, before mentioned: But these are not so universal as the former, being restricted only to what they have studied, during the quarter. They have been found to answer excellent purposes; for thereby, the instructors can easily observe the gradual progress each one makes; and are thence enabled, either to encourage or warn them, as their several cases require. Hence also, as it may be imagined, it hath not a little conduced, to the assiduity and carefulness of the students, in their daily preparations.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="009752_0033_0F7A480E316F0B68"/>THERE is a grammar-school annexed to the college, as a nursery for it, under the general in∣spection of the president, though not a part of the original constitution. This was first set up by president BURR, and has been handed down to his successors, the trustees taking it under their patronage, during the several vacancies in that office. Besides the latin and greek languages, into which the youth are here initiated, they have been also early taught the graces of a good delivery, and spent a small portion of every day in improv∣ing their hand-writing; for which purpose, a pro∣per attendant hath been hitherto provided. But this expedient being found by experience not fully to answer those purposes, it was lately judged proper that an english school should be also esta∣blished, for the sole intention of teaching young lads to write well, to cypher, and to pronounce and read the english tongue with accuracy and precision. The trustees, in consequence, have engaged in their service, a young gentleman, pecu∣liarly well accomplished as a teacher; who hath now opened this school; which, in like manner with the grammar-school, is put under the general superintendency of the president of the College.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="009752_0034_0F7A48105EA88E78"/>INTO these schools, there are no other terms of admission, than the payment of twenty shillings, entrance money; according to the custom of most academies. Standing institutions of this nature must have masters to support and manage them, whether there be few or many scholars, hence the propriety and necessity of requiring something ad∣ditional at their entrance. The case is somewhat similar also in the college; the officers of which are, in a great measure, supported from the tuition money; the fund being quite inadequate to that purpose. But what is here previously paid, is not so properly entrance money, as a small acknow∣ledgment for the dispensation, in regard to the proper charges of the foregoing year or years, which, according to the custom of other colleges, ought to have been spent here. This is required of those only, who at their first coming, enter into the <HI>Sophomore</HI> or <HI>Junior</HI> classes: For later, none are received, unless in very singular cases, as hath been already mentioned. At entering into the former, twenty shillings is paid, being the fourth part of the tuition money for the preceeding year: And on admission into the latter, forty shillings, the fourth part of same, for the two foregoing years.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="009752_0035_0F7A4811058986B8"/>WE come now to give some account of the manner, together with the expences of boarding. It is true, so minute a detail of the little affairs of a college, affords but a dry and unentertaining story: And a relation of the oeconomy of a kitchen and dining room, would be still more low and vulgar. But as the judicious reader must be sensible, that a proper regulation of these matters, is of more consequence to such a community, than a thousand things that would make a more shining figure in description; it is presumed, that some account of them may be expected; and then he will excuse the dulness of the narrative, for the sake of the importance of the information, to those especially, who may encline to educate their sons at this college.</P>
<P>IT is the business of the steward to provide all necessaries for the use of the society, to employ cooks and other servants to cleanse the chambers, make the beds, &amp;c. The tutors, and all the students, and sometimes the president, eat together in the dining hall, always seated according to rank and seniority. No private meals are allowed in their chambers, except with express license on
<PB N="38" REF="009752_0036_0F7A4811C83CD748"/>
special occasions. Tea and coffee are served up for breakfast. At dinner, they have, in turn, almost all the variety of fish and flesh the country here affords, and sometimes pyes; every dish of the same sort, and alike dressed, on one day; but with as great difference, as to the kinds of provision, and manner of cookery, on different days, as the market, and other circumstances will admit. Indeed, no luxurious dainties, or costly delicacies can be looked for among the viands of a college, where health and oeconomy are alone consulted in the furniture of the tables. These, however, are plentifully supplied, without weight or measure allowance: And the meals are conducted with regularity and decorum; waiters being constantly in attendance. The general table-drink is small-beer or cyder. For supper, milk only is the standing allowance; chocolate is sometimes served as a change. Some of the young gentlemen chuse, at times, and are indulged, to make a dish of tea in their apartments, provided it be done after evening prayer; that the time spent therein, may not inter∣fere with the hours of study; except in cases of indisposition, or other circumstances, which are previously laid before one of the officers, in order to
<PB N="39" REF="009752_0037_0F7A48128481EA58"/>
a permit. But this is an article wholly of private expence.</P>
<P>THE annual charge of education, including tuition money, chamber rent, steward's salary, servants wages, washing, fire-wood, and candles, with contingencies, may amount, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> to about twenty five pounds six shillings lawful money of <HI>New-Jersey;</HI> for the market rises and falls; and on some of those articles, the expences are arbitrary. Hence frugality in the student, may sometimes, without meanness, reduce the accompt. The particulars, as they stand, for the most part, in the steward's books, are here specified, and charged upon an average.</P>

<P><PB N="40" REF="009752_0038_0F7A481345DFE030"/>THO' this institution has succeeded, beyond the expectation of its warmest friends, notwithstanding the severe shocks it received, by the death of three presidents, in so quick succession; and its unsettled state, till the chair was filled; yet it still labours under several deficiencies, which nothing but the beneficent hand of charity can relieve. With mathematical instruments, and an apparatus for experiments in natural philosophy, it is but very indifferently furnished. The library wants many of the most approved modern writers, as hath been already hinted. It would be also of eminent service, had it revenues ample enough, to support professors in some of the distinct branches of literature; who might each make a figure in his own province, could his studies and instructions be confined to his peculiar department. A professor of divinity, especially, for the benefit of the theological students, would be of singular utility. At present, there are three tutors, besides the president. To these, the college fund, can as yet, afford but scanty livings; the tutors particularly, unless they assume a vow of celibacy, are unable to continue in their offices for life. Hence it happens, that when a young gentleman has, by study and
<PB N="41" REF="009752_0039_0F7A48140127F988"/>
experience, thoroughly qualified himself for the employment, he often resigns it; and the trustees are then obliged to elect another, perhaps out equally fit for it. Affluent revenues are, indeed, too often fatal snares to political bodies, as well as individuals. And should a professorship be con∣verted into a money-jobb, or lucrative post, and the salaries be so considerable as to become objects of avarice and ambition to unworthy men, it might be a much greater misfortune to the society, than its present indigent state. Hence an income, just sufficient to supply the abovementioned defects, and to afford such livings to a proper number of tutors or professors, as would enable them, decently to maintain their families, seems only to be desirable and requisite.</P>
<P>THE fund, until within about a year past, hath not much exceeded 1300 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> but from a lottery, which was generously set on foot by a number of gentlemen in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in favour of the institu∣tion, it was increased to nearly 2800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the neat produce of the same, after necessary charges, and losses which usually happen, besides what was disbursed to pay urgent debts, being about 1500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>
<PB N="42" REF="009752_0040_0F7A4814BA4E2D90"/>
Exclusive of the annual support of officers, the expences from other quarters are not inconsiderable; nay, do yearly increase, as the number of students increase. The trustees have been obliged to com∣plete the chambers of one whole story of the building, which were at first left unfinished, not being then wanted; and to build a large kitchen, with servants apartments, both to answer its peculiar intention, and, at the same time, to leave more room for lodgings in the college itself. This too still remains without a proper inclosure of its court∣yard and back grounds; which would greatly add to the beauty, as well as real convenience of the hall.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the plate hereunto annexed, the court-yard is repre∣sented as inclosed by a pale-sence, in like manner with that of the president's house: But this is done only from the fancy of the engraver.</NOTE> These, together with several other mediums of expence, will unavoidably exhaust all the cash, that can possibly be spared from its slender fund. Hence, is easily seen, the impossibility under present circumstances, of making new additions or improvements, either in regard to books, an ap∣paratus, or establishment of professorships. Indeed, from the countenance of the general assembly of
<PB N="43" REF="009752_0041_0F7A481726B178C8"/>
this province, in passing an act for a lottery of three thousand pounds, for the benefit of this college, some good addition will probably be made to its revenues. But the returns of this lottery, which was lately drawn, are not yet made; the accompts being still unsettled. However, much greater losses have accrued therein, than might have been reasonably expected, especially from the very unfortunate issue of the tickets left, on the risque of the college, at the time of drawing. So that the managers have reason to think, that, on the close of their books, the clear profits will not much exceed <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 2200. Such an accession can only enable the trustees, to make some addition, perhaps, to the annual allowances of the college officers; tho' not such as will be sufficient to retain them for life, in the character of professors, much less to main∣tain a greater number. Besides, it is not impro∣bable, that by the time they reap the interest of it, another building may become necessary: For an addition of 25 or 30 students more would fill the present house, in such a manner, as that by no possible contrivance, it could be made to contain a greater number, with any tolerable convenience or comfort. And should the numbers increase,
<PB N="44" REF="009752_0042_0F7A481802388EC8"/>
in the same proportion they have done, for these three years past, (which is as 50 to 70) the neces∣sity of such additional building, will be no distant event. This, however, would be a work im∣possible to be carried into execution, upon the strength of the present funds.</P>
<P>BUT beside the occasions of public encourage∣ment abovementioned, and the many private benefactions received, since the foundation of this seminary; it is matter of pleasure to acquaint its friends, that, not long since, a very generous legacy was ordered in the will of the late col. <HI>Alford,</HI> of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> in the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay:</HI> The sum designed for this college, is not yet precisely ascertained, that being left to the discre∣tion of his executors: It is presumed however, from good intelligence, that the appropriation here will not be less in value than <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 500 sterling. Benefactions of this sort are peculiarly honourable,— an indubitable indication of a warm regard for the interests of learning, and of the testator's high sense of the utility of this seat of education in particular. No actions of a man's life are more memorable, than his deeds of liberality, before
<PB N="45" REF="009752_0043_0F7A481879EA0108"/>
the hour of death; when chiefly he considers, what distribution of the gifts of Heaven, may be most agreeable to the will of his divine bene∣factor. May providence excite an emulation in the breasts of others, among the virtuous and opulent, to follow an example of such laudable and christian benevolence: A benevolence, which will extend its influence to remote posterity, and advance the genuine felicity of their country, when they are received into <HI>everlasting habitations,</HI> and are triumphing in the enjoyment of a glorious RECOMPENSE OF REWARD.</P>
<P>THUS is exhibited a faithful account of the origin and present state of the college of <HI>New-Jersey:</HI>—A college, originally designed for the promotion of the general interests of christianity, as well as the cultivation of human science. This end therefore is kept in view, in all the instructions and modes of discipline: To inculcate or even recommend the discriminating opinions of any one protestant denomination in preference to another, is carefully avoided. In those matters, the students are left without any byass offered to their private judgments; and are always allowed, without
<PB N="46" REF="009752_0044_0F7A481E8645E948"/>
restraint, to attend the religious worship of any protestant society, whenever they have oppor∣tunity.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, it is presumed it must appear manifest upon reflection, to every serious observer, that providence hath, in a peculiar manner, super∣intended the affairs of this nursery, from its foun∣dation to the present time. And indeed, it is esteemed by its directors their highest honour and happiness, that the almighty hath vouchsafed so remarkably to countenance and succeed their undertaking, and thereby to encourage their humble expectations of his continued benediction. To the singular favour of Heaven, on the means of instruction here used, it must be gratefully ascribed, that many youth who have come to <HI>Nassau-Hall</HI> for education, without any just sense of the obligations either of natural or revealed re∣ligion, have been here effectually reformed, become men of solid and rational piety, and now appear upon the stage of public action, employing their talents to the honour of the supreme Bestower, and in promoting the good of mankind. Hence the managers of this seminary are emboldened to hope,
<PB N="47" REF="009752_0045_0F7A4820E9132AD0"/>
that while the original design of its establishment is steadily pursued, the same indulgent providence which hath hitherto supported it, amidst the re∣proaches of envy, and the oppositions of malice, will still raise up benefactors to supply its defici∣encies; and succeed their disinterested endeavours to train up our youth in the paths of piety and erudition, for the future service of their country, in any civil or ecclesiastical employments.</P>
