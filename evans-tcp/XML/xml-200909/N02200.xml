<HEAD>TO THE READER</HEAD>
<P>IT is only the <HI>Scriptural</HI> way of treat∣ing this <HI>Noble Subject,</HI> that hath in∣clined me to make public the following <HI>Discourses.</HI> It seems to me the <HI>Method</HI> most easie and perspicuous, most natural and just, most profitable and acceptable to them that value the <HI>Subject;</HI> which all se∣rious <HI>Christians</HI> will do. You have here almost the whole voice of <HI>Scripture</HI> concern∣ing the <HI>Holy Sabbath of the Lord</HI> in a very small compass, and the several <HI>Texts</HI> almost in the same <HI>Order</HI> wherein they lie in the <HI>Holy Bible.</HI> I would hope by this means, as thro' a <HI>Burning glass</HI> (under the Blessing of the <HI>sanctifying Spirit</HI>) to collect the rayes of the Divine <HI>light,</HI> and bear them down with heavenly <HI>heat</HI> upon the <HI>Reader</HI>'s mind and heart.— Not that by any <HI>Art</HI> of mine the <HI>Glass of the Word</HI> can be thus fo∣rm'd
<PB N="ii" REF="002620_0004_0FDB14CC708BB818"/>and fashion'd; but I have <HI>found</HI> it thus form'd and fashion'd to my hand by the <HI>Blessed Inspirer</HI> of it, and bring it <HI>a sacred Mite</HI> to the <HI>Treasurie of the Sanctuary</HI> from whence I received it. May the <HI>Lord of the Sabbath</HI> please to accept the <HI>Offering,</HI> and effectually own it by <HI>blessing</HI> it to its desi∣red <HI>End;</HI> which is to <HI>enlighten</HI> us more in, and <HI>animate</HI> us more unto, this great and singular <HI>Duty of Man</HI> thro' out all Genera∣tions, <HI>the keeping holy the Sabbath Day.</HI>— I have not gone formally into <HI>Directions</HI> and <HI>Motives</HI> on this Head, which are abundant in many <HI>Treatises</HI> already in your hands; but I hope the <HI>Reader</HI> will find <HI>these</HI> every where suggested to him thro' the <HI>Discourses</HI> before him; and in a particular manner be led and excited to consider and improve his <HI>Sabbaths</HI> as a <HI>Sign</HI> and Memorial of the <HI>Co∣venant of Grace,</HI> and the blessed Seasons and Means of <HI>Sanctification.</HI>— So our <HI>Fathers,</HI> like wise and good Men, began with God in the planting of these <HI>Churches:</HI> They <HI>cove∣nanted</HI> with God to be his People and to keep his <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> and they found Him to be <HI>the Lord their Sanctifier.</HI> The reverend Observa∣tion of the <HI>Lords-day</HI> was their distinguish∣ing honour and glory, and the <HI>fruits of holi∣ness</HI> to the praise and glory of God abounded

We had need therefore to <HI>remember how we have received and heard, and hold fast and repent; let no man take our Crown.</HI> I know no one <HI>Rule</HI> more compendious, comprehen∣sive and effectual for the revival and perpe∣tuity of Religion among us than <HI>this,</HI> that we <HI>keep the LORD's Sabbaths,</HI> as <HI>a Sign between</HI> Him and us <HI>thro' out our Generations, that</HI> HE is <HI>the Lord that doth sanctify</HI> us.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>Exodus 31.12, 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the Children of Israel, saying,</P>
<P>Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and you thro' out your Gene∣rations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N these words the great Law of the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is repeated to <HI>Moses,</HI> and by him unto the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> with an awful <HI>preface</HI> and a most pow∣erful <HI>reason</HI> annexed. The <HI>preface</HI> is much the same with that from Heaven, and <HI>Sinai,</HI> before the ten Commandments; <HI>And God spake all these Words saying, I am the Lord thy God.</HI> Let us reverently attend and answer, <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will speak.</HI></P>
<P>THE Commandment is here given in the most august, authoritative and peremptory man∣ner:
<PB N="2" REF="002620_0007_0FDB14D0E72919C8"/><HI>Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep.</HI> More Au∣thority and Commandment can't well be put in∣to fewer words.</P>
<P>Lastly, HERE is a special and most weighty <HI>reason</HI> annexed, to inforce the precept: <HI>for it is a sign,</HI> &amp;c. It is great condescention and grace in God to us, to annex a reason to any of his Commands. His sovereign Will is the highest reason. But there is much of Majesty and much Grace in this reason: <HI>It is a sign between me and you:</HI> And will God in very deed give us such a sign and token between Himself and us? will he in very deed deal so with man upon earth? And give a <HI>standing</HI> sign too <HI>thro' out all the Gene∣rations</HI> of man on earth? O the favour and grace to dust, while he humbles himself to be∣hold the things that are above!</P>
<P>BUT what is the Lord's Sabbath a sign <HI>of</HI> thro' all our Generations? Why it signifies and lets us know 1. that he is <HI>the Lord:</HI> Lord of the world, Lord of our time, Lord of our lives; the great Proprietor and absolute Disposer of them. And 2. that he is the Lord <HI>our Sanctifier:</HI> that I am the Lord <HI>that doth sanctify you.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>how</HI> the Sabbath is a <HI>sign</HI> of <HI>this,</HI> and why this is a <HI>reason</HI> for our keeping and sancti∣fying the Sabbath, is to be said under the <HI>Doc∣trines,</HI> which are these two:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Great GOD vehemently requires of us the Sanctifica∣tion of his Sabbath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it is a sign between Him and us that He is the Lord our Sanctifier.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. D. <HI>THE Lord our God has most strictly and vehemently required the Observation and keeping
<PB N="3" REF="002620_0008_0FDB14D279253238"/>Sabbath. Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep.</HI> Words can't be stricter than these are. And in this manner the precept is always given: <HI>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, I am the Lord.</HI> Lev. 19.30 — I shall only observe to you how strictly and vehe∣mently this law of the Sabbath is insisted on <HI>thro' the whole Bible.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. IT was a Law to man <HI>from the beginning of the world,</HI> and the <HI>first Law</HI> (and second Blessing) that was given to man, even in <HI>Paradise,</HI> in his state of <HI>innocence.</HI> For if man had never sinned, yet there would for ever have remained to him the keeping of a Sabbath, every seventh day: As you read, Gen. 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them, ond on the seventh day God ended his Work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made; and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from all his work which he had created and made.</HI> So from the <HI>Creation</HI> of the world God in∣stituted a weekly Sabbath, for the perpetual so∣lemn praises of the <HI>Creator</HI> from the Sons of men. He sanctified the <HI>Day,</HI> <Q>to be the special Time of <HI>their</HI> blessing Him and <HI>his</HI> blessing them.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp. <HI>Patrick.</HI></NOTE> The seventh day was ordained <HI>a Universal and Everlasting holy Festival</HI> from the Day wherein Man was created. This magnifies the Sabbath and makes it honourable, and sacred for ever to us, that it was the <HI>first</HI> of God's Laws to man. Thus we keep <Q>the <HI>Earths birth-day</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Edwards.</HI></NOTE>: It is a sacred
<PB N="4" REF="002620_0009_0FDB14D41780B170"/>Festival in memory of the <HI>Worlds nativity.</HI></Q> And it leaves us no room to question <HI>Adam</HI>'s keep∣ing the Sabbath day.</P>
<P>THIS solemn and <HI>early</HI> Injunction of a Sab∣bath to man is a Circumstance that puts great honour and dignity upon the <HI>Sabbath-day.</HI> It was ordained for the special honour and perpe∣tual worship of the Lord our Maker, immediatly upon the Creation of our <HI>first Parents,</HI> and in their paradisaic state.</P>
<P>WE read of <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. 8.10, 12. that <HI>he staid yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the Dove out of the Ark.</HI> It appears by this, says Bp. <HI>Patrick,</HI> that on the seventh day <HI>Noah</HI> expected a Blessing rather than on another day; it being the day devoted from the Beginning to religious services.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE sanctification of the Sabbath was <HI>one of the first things given in Commandment to Israel upon their leaving Egypt.</HI> God was now gather∣ing and forming to himself a <HI>Church</HI> in the earth, and it was fitting and necessary to remember them of his <HI>Sabbath</HI> upon their setting out to∣ward <HI>Canaan,</HI> the Type of the everlasting <HI>Sabba∣tism.</HI> They had it may be almost <HI>lost</HI> the Re∣membrance of his Sabbaths in <HI>Egypt,</HI> at least many of them; but <HI>Moses</HI> is directed by God to mind them of it, and that not as a novel but an <HI>ancient</HI> thing. See <HI>Exod.</HI> 16. It was upon the first provision of <HI>Manna</HI> for the Camp of <HI>Israel:</HI> In the 4 <HI>and</HI> 5 <HI>verses</HI> of that <HI>Chapter,</HI> the Lord said to <HI>Moses, Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall gather a certain rate e∣very day; but on the sixth day they shall prepare twice
<PB N="5" REF="002620_0010_0FDB14D5B293C4E8"/>as much as on the other days:</HI> Accordingly, as we read on from the 22 <HI>verse</HI> of that <HI>Chapter, on the sixth day the people gathered twice as much bread, two Omers for one man; and the Rulers came and told Moses: Then he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow is the Rest of the Holy Sabbath to the Lord; then ye shall not find it in the field; six days ye shall gather it, but on the seventh day (which is the Sabbath) in it there shall be none: See, for the Lord hath given you the Sabbath; therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: Abide every man in his place, let no man go out on the Sabbath day. So the people rested on the seventh day.</HI></P>
<P>YOU will easily observe from the whole of this passage, that it supposes the people of <HI>Israel</HI> acquainted with the Law of the Sabbath. It was not now Instituted, but the Institution was <HI>im∣proved</HI> and acted on; first <HI>by God</HI> in his Provi∣dence for the magnifying the Day to <HI>Israel,</HI> a double portion of <HI>Manna</HI> falling (it is likely) on the sixth day; and then <HI>by the People,</HI> they gather∣ing thereon the portion of two days.</P>
<P>THIS was before the peoples arrival at <HI>Sinai,</HI> even upon their entring into the Wilderness; and it remained to them thro' it a lasting Sign and Miracle from heaven in honour of the Sab∣bath day. For if on any other day of the week they left of their <HI>manna</HI> till the morning <HI>it bred worms and stank,</HI> but it kept good and sweet when they laid it up for the Sabbath day.</P>
<P>"THUS the Law of the Sabbath was given to <HI>Israel</HI> before the delivery of the Law from <HI>Sinai,</HI> and the Day was kept before the <HI>Deca∣logue</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002620_0011_0FDB14D700774728"/>was given: the Institution was <HI>before</HI> the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Edwards.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. THE Law of the Sabbath was <HI>one of the ten Words, the ten Commandments, given from Sinai,</HI> in that august and fearful manner as you all know. On <HI>Sinai</HI> God repeated this his Law <HI>out of the midst of the fire.</HI> God himself came down that day from Heaven with his mighty Angels; he came down in thick darkness and flames of devouring fire: <HI>Sinai was altogether in a smoke and the mountain quaked greatly;</HI> the Congregation below were ready to <HI>die</HI> with fear lest the light∣nings should consume them. <HI>Who of all flesh,</HI> but <HI>they</HI> in that singular day, <HI>ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire and lived?</HI> In this manner did the great God give the <HI>fourth Commandment</HI> unto his Church, that they should <HI>remember</HI> it and <HI>keep</HI> it for ever, and not dare to forget it. Deu. 4.9, 10. <HI>Only take heed to thy self and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and lest they de∣part from thy heart all the days of thy life; especially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their Children.</HI>—O that we and our Children may ever <HI>remember</HI> how, in what majesty and terror, God has commanded us to keep holy the Sabbath day.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002620_0012_0FDB14D8B61980A8"/>
I need not add, how that after the great God had spoken this Law from heaven, he also <HI>wrote it on a Table of stone,</HI> with his own finger, to perpetuate the Remembrance and observation of it; and to imprint it upon <HI>the harder</HI> hearts and consciences of men: And he only who wrote in the Table of stone, can write it on the <HI>fleshly tables of our hearts.</HI> And that the whole might be yet more reverend and sanctifying to us, he laid it up within the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> under the <HI>Mercy-seat.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, It pleased the Holy God to <HI>en∣large,</HI> in many weighty words, on this Law of the Sabbath, when he came down on <HI>Sinai.</HI> He charged them to <HI>remember</HI> this Law: he call'd it <HI>the Sabbath of the Lord their God:</HI> he told them <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>how,</HI> and <HI>why</HI> he sanctified it. There is something very <HI>awful</HI> in God's using all these obliging and constraining words. 'Twas a Law worthy to be thus <HI>solemnly</HI> revived and <HI>long</HI> in∣sisted on: a very <HI>important</HI> point for the <HI>honour</HI> of God and our <HI>Salvation.</HI>—Wherefore let the Majesty of <HI>that Day</HI> be evermore in the eyes and ears and hearts of the people of God.—To go on,</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE Law of the Sabbath was <HI>repeated and inculcated upon the delivery of the Ceremonial and Judicial Law;</HI> yea it was <HI>inserted</HI> into the latter, as being indeed a line and hedge about all the Statutes and Judgments of God given by the hand of <HI>Moses;</HI> to keep them all from being broken. For indeed piety and religion, and also justice and righteousness, flourish or decline
<PB N="8" REF="002620_0013_0FDB14D9F744E148"/>among the Covenant people of God, as the <HI>Sab∣bath</HI> is sanctified or profaned among them. A special honour is put upon the <HI>fourth Command∣ment,</HI> and a special reverence to it is required from us, by God's repeating it to his Church on these great Occasions. I will name them di∣stinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE have in my <HI>Text and Context</HI> the Law of the Sabbath repeated <HI>upon the delivery of the Ceremonial Law.</HI> God having finish'd here his Orders and directions to <HI>Moses</HI> concerning the Tabernacle of the Congregation, the Ark, the Mercy-seat, and all the furniture of the Taber∣nacle; the Table, the Candlestic, and the Altar of Incense, the Altar of burnt-offering, the La∣ver and his foot; the Holy Garments, the anointing Oil and the sweet Incense; Then the Lord added,— <HI>Speak thou unto the Children of Israel, Verily my Sabbaths you shall keep; it is a sign between me and you thro' out your Generations,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW the most learned <HI>Expositors</HI> upon my Text agree, that this Commandment is here re∣peated on this Occasion, that so the people of God might not think that <Q>even the sacred work of the Tabernacle might be done upon the Sabbath day.</Q> Even that Work of God, of whatever importance, necessity and haste it were, would not warrant them to break the holy Rest of God's Day. Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> therefore gives the Sense of my text thus, <HI>Verily my Sabbaths you shall keep;</HI> i. e. <Q>notwithstanding the work of the Tabernacle be holy, and diligently and speedi∣ly to be done, yet I'll not have any of it done on the Sabbath day. And so Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002620_0014_0FDB14DFFA433110"/>Even Tabernacle-work must give way to the Sabbath rest:</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sic volo ista fieri, ut nihilominus opifices cessent Sabbatho opere. <HI>Pareus in loc.</HI>
<P>They might not think this sacred Work would war∣rant them to break the Sabbath. Bp. <HI>Patrick.</HI></P></NOTE> It means the work and labour of preparing and rearing the Tabernacle; not the Holy Services of it afterward; for so the Priests profaned the Sabbath and were guiltless; their Labours being in themselves holy, like the work of Ministers on the Lord's days under the Gospel. So God himself has given the distincti∣on between servile and holy work or labours. Lev. 23.25.</P>
<P>BUT the true and great <HI>Reason,</HI> as it seems to me, why God repeated the Law of his Sab∣bath unto Israel upon his giving the <HI>Ceremonial Law</HI> to them, was this— Because the Cere∣monial law was originally designed by God, and always subordinated and subservient unto <HI>the Sanctification of the Sabbath,</HI> in the worship and services of the Tabernacle and Temple. It was eminently instituted for this one end, the solem∣nizing of the Lord's Sabbaths at the Tabernacle. Then the offerings and sacrifices were <HI>doubled,</HI> and therefore necessarily the Services of the Priests. These were made <HI>for the Sabbath;</HI> and therefore no wonder that when these were in∣stituted the Law of the Sabbath was repeated. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Judicial Law</HI> which God gave to Is∣rael by the hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> had the Law of the Sabbath <HI>inserted into it</HI> This forensic or judicial Law was for the <HI>Civil Government</HI> of that Peo∣ple
<PB N="10" REF="002620_0015_0FDB14E24F8AE990"/>of God, and contained a <HI>Body</HI> or System of Laws to be observed by the <HI>Magistrates</HI> and Ru∣lers, for the good order and peaceable and quiet living of the people, in all Godliness and ho∣nesty. These <HI>Judgments</HI> Moses began to set be∣fore them, by order from God, presently after the delivery of the moral Law or ten Com∣mandments. You have a great part of them in the 21, 22, and 23. <HI>Chapters</HI> of <HI>Exodus:</HI> And at the 12. <HI>verse</HI> of the 23. Chapter you find an ab∣stract of the <HI>fourth Commandment,</HI> inserted thus,—<HI>Six days shalt thou do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest, that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and that the Son of thy handmaid and the stran∣ger may be refreshed.</HI> Here, as I take it, the fourth Commandment was made a <HI>Law of the State</HI> to Israel, whose Legislature was properly a <HI>Theocracy,</HI> and their Rulers and Magistrates had the Executive power and trust committed to them. And doubtless God thus honour'd the Law of the Sabbath to Israel his people, by in∣serting it in the Body of their Judicial Laws, to teach <HI>civil Governments</HI> to do the like in all parts and ages of the World, to whom the knowledge thereof should come. And accordingly the good <HI>Government</HI> over us have in their wisdom and piety Enacted the strict Sanctification of the <HI>Lord's day,</HI> and have forbid the profanation of it under such and such penalties; wherein they have but done the part of a <HI>Christian Govern∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the sacred Law of sanctifying the Sabbath stands in Scripture as a hedge about the <HI>whole Mosaic Law,</HI> both Ceremonial and Judicial.
<PB N="11" REF="002620_0016_0FDB14E3AAD535C0"/>For (as One says) where no Conscience is made of keeping the Sabbath, farewel both Godliness and honesty. God in his wisdom and gracious care has therefore set the fourth Commandment (as it were) between the two Tables of the mo∣ral Law; and also drawn it (as it were) as a line about all his positive laws, statutes and judg∣ments; that none should break over <HI>this</HI> and violate them.— But I go on,</P>
<P N="5">V. GOD has from the beginning <HI>very dread∣fully threatned, and terribly punished the violation of the Sabbath.</HI> Laws are of little force without a Penalty, nor that without an Execution. The Threatnings of God, and his Judgments on sin∣ners, are as a <HI>flowing sword</HI> to guard his Holy Sabbaths from profanation, and to keep men <HI>in</HI> the way to the tree of life. And here,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. VERY dreadful are the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of God against those that profane his Holy Sabbaths. In our Context the threatning is, <HI>v.</HI> 14. <HI>Every one that defileth the Sabbath shall surely be put to death; whosoever doeth any work thereon, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</HI> <Q>This was the penalty then incurred by Sabbath-break∣ers, and then inflicted by the Lord of the Sabbath.</Q> How severe a penalty! If any dar'd <HI>openly</HI> to profane the Sabbath in <HI>Israel,</HI> so that the Crime came to the notice of the Judge and were prov'd upon the offender, "the Magistrate "must cut him off by the sword of Justice: But if the profanation were more <HI>hidden</HI> and cou'd not be prov'd upon him, or <Q>if the Ma∣gistrate were remiss and did not do his duty,
<PB N="12" REF="002620_0017_0FDB14E548327320"/>then God wou'd take the work into his own hand, and cut him off by a stroke from hea∣ven. This the Sabbath breaker might justly fear, and no doubt often suffer'd.</Q> But the <HI>spi∣ritual</HI> Judgment of God and his Eternal punish∣ment of this Sin, is infinitly greater. And if men despise God's Sabbaths, as it provokes him greatly to <HI>cut them off</HI> from among his people now, so without repentance he will <HI>cut them off</HI> for ever.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. VERY dreadful have the <HI>punishments</HI> of this Sin been, by the immediate Commandment of God, to <HI>Rulers,</HI> or by the hand of his <HI>Provi∣dence.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>BY the immediate and direct Command of the High God the <HI>first</HI> open and presumptuous breaker of the Sabbath was punished with <HI>death.</HI> You have the melancholly and dismal Story, <HI>Num.</HI> 15. from the 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to the 36. verse. <HI>And while the Children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day: and they bro't him to Moses and unto Aaron, and all the Congregation: And the Lord said unto Moses, the Man shall be surely put to death; all the Congregation shall stone him with stones without the Camp: And he died, as the Lord commanded Moses.</HI> God made him an <HI>Example,</HI> to deter others for evermore from the like Sin.</P>
<P>BUT then also, God has in his <HI>Holy Providence</HI> dreadfully judg'd and punish'd for the Sin of Sabbath-breaking. How many he cuts off by <HI>untimely deaths</HI> for this sin we know not; but there is reason to fear they may be many. Read the threatning and warning, <HI>Levit,</HI> 26.31, 34.

<P N="6">VI. <HI>THE holy Prophets of the Lord did in their times vehemently insist on the sanctification of the Lords Sabbaths;</HI> they complain'd of and declared a∣gainst the profanation of it, and they made in God's name the most gracious Promises to the people of God in case of their religious Obser∣vation thereof.

1. I say, The Holy Prophets of God did in their times <HI>vehemently insist</HI> on the keeping God's Sabbaths. I scarce know a stricter precept and fuller direction in this point thro' the whole Book of God, than those words of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> the 58. Chap. and 13. v. <HI>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the Holy of the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him; not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words.</HI> Here the Prophet taught the people of God <HI>how</HI> to Sabbatize, and requir'd them <HI>so</HI> to keep the Sabbath; and his words are written for our admonition and learn∣ing.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WE must <HI>turn away our foot</HI> from the Sab∣bath: from <HI>trampling</HI> on it, (says a late pious <HI>Expositor</HI>) as profane, atheistical people do; from <HI>travelling</HI> on it, as many worldly men are ready to do; and from those <HI>walks</HI> and <HI>diversions</HI> on it, which men of pleasure and licence are apt to take.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. WE must not <HI>do our own ways,</HI> nor <HI>find our own pleasure</HI> on God's holy day. <Q>We must not follow our <HI>Callings,</HI> which is to do our own <HI>ways;</HI> nor follow our <HI>sports</HI> and recreations, which is to find our own <HI>pleasures.</HI></Q> Especially we must beware of the defiling and polluting pleasures of sin, which are unlawful on any day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. WE must not <HI>speak our own words:</HI> Not give our selves that liberty of speech on the Sab∣bath day, which we may lawfully take on other days. Our words must be then guarded, grave, and seasoned with grace. We must speak God's
<PB N="15" REF="002620_0020_0FDB14ED8E892160"/>word; speak of Him and of his Works, out of his Word: not talk of our worldly affairs and business as on other days.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. IT must be <HI>honourable</HI> to us because <HI>the holy of the Lord.</HI> The holy duties of it should be pleasant and delightful to us. We must honour it as the <HI>Lord's day;</HI> the day which the Lord has made; made for himself, and sanctified to his honour and service; made sacred to us, and to be spent in holy duties: <HI>We will rejoyce and be glad in it.</HI> Psal. 118.24.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>AFTER this manner <HI>Isaiah</HI> prescribes and re∣quires the keeping a Sabbath: how spiritual and reverend! and thus <HI>from one Sabbath to another</HI> should <HI>all flesh come and worship before the</HI> Lord. <HI>Isai.</HI> 66.23.</P>
<P>LET us pass on to the Prophecies of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and observe how he also insists on the Sanctifica∣tion of the Sabbath. Jer. 17.20, 22. <HI>Hear ye the word of the Lord ye Kings of Judah, and all the Inha∣bitants of Jerusalem that enter in by these gates; thus saith the Lord, Take heed to your selves and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the Gates of Jerusalem; neither do ye any work, but hal∣low the Sabbath day as I commanded your Fathers.</HI> This Commandment was to the <HI>King</HI> and all the people together: The highest and lowest are equally under this Law and must be obedient. And to the <HI>Rulers</HI> it belongs to see to it that the Sabbath be sanctified by their People.</P>
<P>A like Order both to Prince and peasant, for the religious observation of the Sabbath we have from the pen of the prophet <HI>Ezehiel,</HI> 46. Chap. 1,2. <HI>The Gate of the inner Court that looketh toward
<PB N="16" REF="002620_0021_0FDB14EEF87CD890"/>the East shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and the Prince shall enter by it,— and the Priest shall prepare his burnt-offer∣ing,— and he shall worship at the threshold of the Gate,— and it shall not be shut until the Evening.</HI> It is the duty of <HI>Princes,</HI> and it is the priviledge of <HI>peasants,</HI> to go up to the Sanctuary of God on his Sabbaths, then and there to worship him with holy reverence, as unworthy to tread the threshold of his Gates.</P>
<P>IN this frame and spirit we find <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and the Princes, Priests and Levites with him, <HI>signing a Covenant to walk in the Laws of God and to keep his Sabbath.</HI> Nehem 10.31. We cannot walk in God's laws and not keep his Sabbaths; In our Covenanting with God to walk in his laws, we do in a special manner covenant to keep his Sabbaths. This is a special <HI>Article</HI> in God's <HI>Covenant</HI> with his People.</P>
<P>THUS have the Holy prophets <HI>insisted</HI> on the Observation of the Sabbath in their days and times.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY <HI>complain'd grievously of the profanation of it.</HI> For this they had too often sad occasion. <HI>What evil thing is this that ye do?</HI> said holy <HI>Nehe∣miah</HI> to the people of his day;— <HI>Ye profane the Sabbath day.</HI> It griev'd the good <HI>Governour</HI> to the heart to see it. He called it a most <HI>evil</HI> thing. He spake of it with a pious <HI>anger</HI> and indignati∣on, to see God so dishonoured; and with a holy <HI>fear</HI> of the Consequence of such a provo∣cation. In like manner the Prophets, <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and <HI>Amos.</HI> Ezek. 22.8. <HI>Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my Sabbaths.</HI> 20.13. <HI>My
<PB N="17" REF="002620_0022_0FDB157E357257B0"/>Sabbaths they greatly polluted, then I said I would pour out my fury upon them to consume them.</HI> Amos 8.5, 8. <HI>Shall not the Land tremble for this? and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and will not the end thereof be as a bitter day?</HI>— It is a sorrowful and fearful Symptom, when peeople are <HI>sick</HI> of their Sabbaths; weary of the sacred rest, and tir'd with the holy work.— But on the con∣trary, and to add no more,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Prophets of the Lord have made <HI>ma∣ny great and precious Promises</HI> to the people of God, in case of their <HI>religious Observation of the Holy Sabbath.</HI> The God who has blessed the seventh day and put his Name upon it, will bless all them that keep it holy. <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> are the spe∣cial and more natural fruit of Sabbath Sanctifi∣cation; but the <HI>outward</HI> blessings of Providence are also the reward of it. This is the way to ensure the spiritual and temporal Blessing toge∣ther. Isai. 56.2. <HI>Blessed is the man that doeth this, that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it.</HI> This brings a blessing on all our imployments, but especially upon our Souls. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE spiritual Blessing, yea <HI>all spiritual blessings in heavenly places,</HI> is the promise to the <HI>Person</HI> that keeps God's Sabbaths. Isai. 56.4, 5, 6. <HI>For thus saith the Lord to them that keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my Covenant; even to them will I give in my House and within my Walls, a place and a name better than of Sons and Daughters; I will give them an everlast∣ing name that shall not be cut off:— I will bring them to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in
<PB N="18" REF="002620_0023_0FDB158201AF1378"/>my house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their Sa∣crifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar.</HI></P>
<P>NOTE here, That these <HI>three</HI> things go to∣gether; the religious Observation of the Sab∣bath, the Choosing the things that please God, and the taking hold of his Covenant. Look where you will and shew me one that keeps God's Sabbaths, and you shall find him one that in all other points likewise chuses the things that please him; And such may and will and do lay hold of God's Covenant. It is from a sincere universal desire of pleasing God and glorifying him, that the pious worshippers of God set them∣selves to observe and keep his Sabbaths. Such have (thro' grace) consented and come up to the Terms of God's Covenant, have taken him for their God, his Word for their Rule, and giv∣en themselves up to him, in his holy ways and among his people.</P>
<P>AND now how great and precious are the <HI>Promises</HI> made here to this holy Sabbatizer? even all the Blessings of the Covenant of Grace are assured to him; present peace and communion with God and supplies of Grace, and the ever∣lasting love and mercies of our Heavenly Father. They have a <HI>Name</HI> among the Children of God, a Name in the Church on earth, a Name writ∣ten in Heaven; an everlasting Name that shall not be cut off.— Thus the <HI>Spiritual Blessing</HI> is the Promise to the <HI>person</HI> that keeps God's Sabbaths. And then</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Temporal</HI> blessing is promised to the <HI>People</HI> that do this. To prove this I need only turn you again to the 58. Isai. 13, 14. <HI>If thou call
<PB N="19" REF="002620_0024_0FDB1583118686C8"/>the Sabbath a delight,</HI> &amp;c <HI>Then shalt thou delight thy self in the Lord, and I will cause thee to ride up∣on the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the Heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</HI> Here are the temporal Re∣wards; even riches, honour, power, safety, pros∣perity and dignity; to the place and people, the Country or Nation, that keep God's Sabbaths.</P>
<P>GOD promis'd his <HI>Israel</HI> that he wou'd make them high in Name and honour, if they sought his honour and observ'd his will; and that their Nei'bours should see him bless them. He pro∣mised them to feed 'em, to defend 'em, and to advance 'em. He promis'd that if they would zealously and religiously keep his appointed <HI>Feasts,</HI> no man should desire their Land when they went up unto 'em. He also bid them prove him, if he did not open the Heavens over them to pour down Blessings, if they duly regarded his Worship and Sanctuary. And doubtless this will always commend a People to his favour and blessing in the course of his Providence; and he will be their shield and strength, and the lifter up of their head.</P>
<P>IN a Word, We have the promise and the threatning repeated, the Blessing and the Curse; Jer. 17.24, 25, 27. <HI>And it shall some to pass if ye diligently hearken to me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burden thro' the gates of this City on the Sabbath day; but if ye hallow the same;— then shall there enter still into it Kings and Princes sitting upon the Throne of David, riding in Chariots and on horses; and this City shall remain for ever; and burnt-offer∣ings and sacrifices, meat-offerings and Incense of praise,
<PB N="20" REF="002620_0025_0FDB15874EE3A158"/>shall still be in the house of the Lord:— But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in the Gates of Jerusalem, which shall devour its palaces,</HI> (whereof the <HI>Temple</HI> was a principal one) <HI>and it shall not he quenched.</HI>—That is to say,</P>
<P>THE religious Sanctification of God's Sab∣baths would have been a means of preserving the <HI>Royal House of David,</HI> and the <HI>Holy City</HI> of God; But for the profanation of the Sabbath both the one and the other were bro't to ruine. The prophet assured them from God, that in case they would keep <HI>his Day,</HI> He would keep the <HI>Court,</HI> the <HI>City,</HI> the <HI>Country</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> and make all to flourish: But on the contrary, if they went on to profane the Lord's Sabbaths, the Lord would destroy them <HI>all</HI> together. And so it was: The <HI>Enemy</HI> prevailed against <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and kindled a <HI>fire</HI> in the Gates of the City, which burnt down the <HI>Palace</HI> of the King and the <HI>Tem∣ple</HI> of God, and none could quench it.</P>
<P>AND thus I have shewn <HI>thro' Moses and the Prophets,</HI> how strictly and vehemently the Holy God has required and inculcated the Sanctifica∣tion of the <HI>Sabbath day.</HI></P>
<P>WHICH was the thing to be prov'd,— <HI>Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep.</HI> The <HI>Instances</HI> given, from the precept to <HI>Adam</HI> unto and by the last of the <HI>Prophets,</HI> are so many plain and affecting <HI>proofs,</HI> as well as singular <HI>Illustrations,</HI> of my <HI>Doctrine.</HI> The <HI>method</HI> which I have taken is, I think, the most <HI>simple</HI> and natural Exposition of what the <HI>Scripture</HI> has said upon this head, so far as I have gone.— God bless what we have heard for
<PB N="21" REF="002620_0026_0FDB1588E2A18250"/>the Increasing in us the <HI>Reverence</HI> of his Holy Day, the <HI>strict</HI> Observation of it, and the <HI>fear</HI> of profaning it. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>THE great Law of the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is here repeated to <HI>Moses,</HI> and by him unto the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> with an awful <HI>Pre∣face,</HI> in a most commanding <HI>Manner,</HI> and with a most powerful <HI>Reason</HI> annexed.

<P><PB N="22" REF="002620_0027_0FDB158A2720A1D0"/>
THE last time I spake in this place, I pro∣posed to speak to these <HI>two Doctrines.</HI> I. <HI>That the Great GOD has most strictly and vehemently re∣quired the Sanctification of the Sabbath day.</HI> II. <HI>That it is a sign between Him and us that he is the Lord that doth sanctify us.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd not quite get thro' the <HI>first Doctrine</HI> on the last <HI>Lecture,</HI> namely,</P>
<P>I. D. <HI>THAT the Lord our God has most strictly and vehemently required us to keep his Sabbaths. Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep.</HI>— It was a <HI>Law</HI> to Man from the beginning of the World, and the <HI>first</HI> Law that was given to him, even in his state of Innocence. It was one of the first things given in Commandment to <HI>Israel</HI> upon their leaving <HI>Egypt.</HI> It was one of the <HI>ten Words,</HI> the ten Commandments, given from <HI>Sinai,</HI> in that august and fearful manner. It was repeated and inculcated upon the delivery of the <HI>Ceremo∣nial</HI> and <HI>Judicial Law,</HI> and was indeed inserted into the latter. Moreover. God has from the beginning very dreadfully <HI>threatned</HI> and terribly <HI>punished</HI> the violation of this Commandment. And by the mouth of all his <HI>Holy Prophets</HI> he has vehemently <HI>insisted on</HI> the Sanctification of the Sabbath day, <HI>complained of</HI> and declar'd against the profanation of it; and they have made in God's name the most gracious <HI>promises</HI> to the people of God in case of their religious Observa∣tion thereof.— Thus <HI>thro' the Scriptures of the Old Testament</HI> we find abundant proofs and plain Illustrations of our <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>I shall continue the <HI>proof</HI> of this <HI>great Truth</HI> thro' the <HI>Scriptures of the New Testament.</HI> The re∣ligious
<PB N="23" REF="002620_0028_0FDB158E697F7D48"/>and strict Observation of the <HI>Lord's day</HI> is <HI>there</HI> also directed to, prescribed and enjoyned; but more by the holy practice and example of our <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> than by precepts.</P>
<P>THE Law of a <HI>Sabbath</HI> was nothing peculiar to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church. It was before them, even a Law from the <HI>beginning</HI> of the world, and it continues after them, unto the <HI>End</HI> of time. <HI>There remaineth the keeping of a Sabbath to the people of God,</HI> and it will do so while the world lasts. The Law is <HI>Moral,</HI> and of perpetual Use, uni∣versal Obligation. We <HI>need</HI> the priviledge of a Sabbath now, its use and benefit to our Souls; as much as the People of God did heretofore: And we <HI>owe</HI> this homage, honour and service to God as much now as his People of old did. A <HI>weekly Sabbath</HI> is a small rent and acknowledge∣ment unto the LORD of our lives, <HI>in whose hand all our time is.</HI></P>
<P>LET us look into the holy <HI>Gospels,</HI> the <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> the <HI>Epistles</HI> of <HI>Paul,</HI> and the <HI>Reve∣lations</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> and read the mind of <HI>Christ</HI> re∣specting the religious Observation of the <HI>Sabbath∣day.</HI> And let us bear in mind that the Practice of Christ and his Apostles is a <HI>Law</HI> to us in this matter. For (as a late worthy <HI>Writer</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Wright <HI>on the</HI> religious Observation <HI>of the</HI> Lord's-Day.</NOTE> has it) <Q><HI>Actions</HI> do certainly make a <HI>Law,</HI> where they sufficiently <HI>publish the Mind and Will of the Law∣giver,</HI> as much as <HI>words.</HI></Q> If then we can find Actions of our <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> and of his <HI>Apostles</HI> af∣ter him, equivalent to a <HI>verbal</HI> Precept, for the Observation of the <HI>Christian Shbbath,</HI> we must
<PB N="24" REF="002620_0029_0FDB15900D6DC650"/>needs account it <HI>his</HI> Institution and Command∣ment to us.</P>
<P>IN the blessed Life of our <HI>Saviour</HI> we read once and again of his going into the <HI>Synagogues,</HI> to attend the publick <HI>Worship</HI> of God on the <HI>Sab∣bath days.</HI> Luke 4.6. <HI>As his Custom was he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day.</HI> This he did to teach and require <HI>us</HI> to keep the <HI>Sabbath</HI> as he did. He has given us <HI>this</HI> Example that we should follow his steps. So he serv'd and worship'd God, fulfilling all Righteousness, and so must we. He came not to <HI>destroy</HI> the Law and the Prophets, but to <HI>fulfil</HI> them. Had he put an <HI>end</HI> to the <HI>Sacred weekly Sabbath,</HI> it had <HI>destroyed the Law and the Prophets</HI> with a witness. But <HI>Christ</HI> fulfilled this Law, and kept many a Sab∣bath to the glory of God in a perfect manner, so as no meer man, nor all the Holy men of God together, ever did or can do. He has taught us how to Sabbatise; how to spend our Sabbaths in the solemn Assemblies, and in works of piety and mercy. Many a high Exercise of <HI>devotion,</HI> and many a good work of <HI>charity,</HI> did he upon the Sabbath-day. He fill'd up the Holy time with <HI>work,</HI> and the work with <HI>Spirit.</HI> For these very works of God like goodness he was some∣times reproached as a <HI>breaker</HI> of the Sabbath; but it turn'd to the confusion of his ignorant and superstitious, if not hypocritical and malicious <HI>Accusers.</HI> As in Mark 3. Init. He sanctified and honour'd the Sabbath by his divine <HI>Sermons,</HI> and by his <HI>miracles of mercy</HI> on that blessed day. He made it a Day of <HI>his Blessing</HI> to men, both on temporal and spiritual accounts. Luk. 13.10, 17.
<PB N="25" REF="002620_0030_0FDB1591A8552A30"/>He kept that blessed Law for his <HI>Elect,</HI> which Believers themselves keep so <HI>poorly</HI> and imper∣fectly.— He also taught his <HI>Disciples</HI> and fol∣lowers to observe and keep the Sabbath-day, Indeed some of the superstitious <HI>Pharisees</HI> did sometimes tax the <HI>Disciples</HI> with taking <HI>undue liberties</HI> on the Holy Sabbath. But <HI>what</HI> was it? they <HI>plucked an ear of corn and eat of it as they passed thro' a field.</HI> They were hungry and it was but a proper and needed taste, and an ordinary hasty bit, for their support and refreshment in the services of the day. The <HI>Women</HI> also that followed our <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> and ministred unto him, were strict Sabbatizers: Luk. 23. ult. <HI>They rested on the Sabbath day according to the Commandment.</HI> Tho' they were preparing <HI>spices</HI> for the dead body of their dear <HI>Saviour,</HI> yet they laid by the holy care and labour of love till the <HI>Sabbath</HI> was over. <HI>Verily God's Sabbaths did they keep;</HI> even as if the words of my <HI>Text</HI> were then in their remembrance, and they considered that as the holy work of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> was to give place to the holy Rest of God's day, so their pious mi∣nistring to <HI>that sacred Temple of the Deity,</HI> our <HI>Lords Body.</HI>— And <HI>that</HI> was the <HI>last Seventh day Sab∣bath</HI> which the Disciples kept. For <HI>early</HI> in the morning of the <HI>next day,</HI> being the <HI>first day of the week</HI> these <HI>Women</HI> came unto the <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> bring∣ing the <HI>Spices</HI> which they had prepared;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Luk. 24.1, 13, 34, 36. And John 20.1, 16, 19, 26.</NOTE> and <HI>they found not the Body of Jesus, but had a vision of Angels who told them of his resurrection from the dead.</HI>— And that <HI>same day</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> himself
<PB N="26" REF="002620_0031_0FDB15921F8B8020"/>appeared <HI>several times</HI> to one and another of his Followers; to <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> to the <HI>two disci∣ples</HI> on their way to <HI>Emmaus,</HI> to <HI>Simon,</HI> and to the <HI>ten</HI> together in the <HI>Evening:</HI> when he <HI>blessed</HI> them, <HI>breathed on 'em,</HI> and gave them their <HI>Com∣mission.</HI> That day <HI>seven night,</HI> being again the <HI>first day of the week,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> appeared again unto them, <HI>Thomas</HI> being then present, and <HI>shewed them his hands and his feet.</HI>— Now by the <HI>Resurrecti∣on of Christ</HI> on the <HI>first day</HI> of the week, and by his repeated <HI>visits</HI> to them on this day, the In∣spired <HI>Apostles</HI> (under the infallible Conduct of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>) from thenceforth held their so∣lemn Meetings, their holy Convocations, on <HI>this</HI> day of the seven, and called it the <HI>Lord's-Day.</HI>— On this <HI>first</HI> day of the week, the Disciples <HI>were all with one accord in one place,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. 1.1, 2.</NOTE> assembled as on <HI>their holy Sabbath,</HI> when suddenly there appeared the <HI>cloven Tongues of fire and sat upon them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost; and spake in every language the wonderful works of God;</HI> the proper <HI>service</HI> of the Sabbath day. That this day of <HI>Pentecost</HI> was the <HI>first day of the week</HI> is easily computed and proved. The day after the <HI>Passo∣ver</HI> was the <HI>first day of the feast of unleavened bread;</HI> (see Lev. 23.5, 6.) which was as a <HI>Sabbath</HI> to the <HI>Jews;</HI> They were to have an <HI>holy Convoca∣tion</HI> on it, and to do <HI>no servile</HI> work thereon. On the <HI>next</HI> day was the <HI>Offering of the first-fruits unto the Lord:</HI> And from <HI>this</HI> day, (the next but one after the <HI>Passover</HI>) they were order'd to count <HI>fifty days,</HI> or <HI>seven weeks</HI> complete; and
<PB N="27" REF="002620_0032_0FDB1592231EC4B8"/>then was the feast of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> so called from the <HI>fiftieth</HI> day. Now see how <HI>these</HI> things were all fulfilled in the <HI>Dying</HI> and <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> and in the <HI>pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost.</HI>— Our blessed Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> was slain at the <HI>Passover,</HI> which fell that year on a <HI>fryday:</HI> Then was the <HI>Lamb of God</HI> offered, <HI>Christ our Passover sacrificed for us.</HI>— That <HI>Even∣ing</HI> therefore was <HI>the preparation,</HI> as it is called <HI>John</HI> 19.31. scil. the preparation both for <HI>the weekly Sabbath,</HI> and also for <HI>the Feast of unleavened bread;</HI> which made <HI>that Sabbath a high day.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> therefore were earnest with <HI>Pilate</HI> to have the Bodies taken down <HI>early</HI> from the Cross. <HI>This</HI> whole Sabbath our Lord's Body lay in the grave. And the <HI>next</HI> morning early, being the <HI>first day of the week,</HI> the next day <HI>but one</HI> after the Passover, <HI>the day of the offering of the first-fruits un∣to the Lord,</HI> he rose from the dead, and <HI>became the first-fruits of them that sleep.</HI> Now compute just <HI>seven weeks</HI> from <HI>this</HI> day of our <HI>Lord's</HI> Resurrec∣tion, and the <HI>first day of the eighth week,</HI> even the <HI>fiftieth day,</HI> was the day of <HI>Pentecost;</HI> when the <HI>Spirit, (the promise of the Father)</HI> was pour'd out from the ascended <HI>Jesus</HI> upon his <HI>Apostles,</HI> as they were assembled together for his solemn Worship. <Q>Then (as one says) they themselves received the <HI>first-fruits of the Spirit,</HI> and thro' the word of truth begat three thousand souls to <HI>Christ;</HI> and presented them as the <HI>first-fruits of the Christian Church</HI> unto <HI>God</HI> and to the <HI>Lamb.</HI></Q> Thus did our <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> honour and hallow the <HI>first</HI> day of the week by giving the <HI>Sanctifier</HI> and the <HI>Com∣forter</HI> thereon. So did he shed Him forth in his
<PB N="28" REF="002620_0033_0FDB1595CAC7C018"/>miraculous <HI>Gifts</HI> and in his saving <HI>Graces,</HI> abun∣dantly on <HI>that</HI> day. He poured out the <HI>Blessing</HI> from on high, and blessed the <HI>Day,</HI> to be <HI>an holy Sabbath unto Himself;</HI> and unto <HI>us,</HI> the day for our "seeking and receiving spiritual blessings. Such <HI>Actions</HI> (says <HI>One</HI>) do as fully declare and express the mind and will of <HI>Heaven</HI> as any <HI>words</HI> could do— Especially if we find (as we do) in the <HI>sacred Writings,</HI> that the <HI>Apostles</HI> and primitive Christians <HI>did</HI> thenceforth observe the <HI>first</HI> day of the week for their religious <HI>Assemblies,</HI> and for the Administration of the <HI>special Ordinances</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> thereon. And this we do expresly read, that they <HI>did come together on the first day of the week to break bread, and</HI> that <HI>Paul preached to them.</HI> Act. 20.7. They were wont to come together to <HI>hear</HI> and to receive the Sacrament of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> on <HI>that</HI> day. It is spoken of as their <HI>usual</HI> practice, and they were "under the infallible Direction of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> in Acti∣ons of this nature and importance. So that their <HI>Example</HI> and practice herein must amount to a <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Institution</HI> to the Christian Church; in∣terpreting to us the <HI>mind</HI> and giving us the <HI>will</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> in this matter. And to borrow the words of a late <HI>Writer,</HI> <Q>As <HI>Moses</HI> was faithful in set∣tling the matters of the <HI>Jewish</HI> worship and of the Tabernacle, being authorised by God and guided by him in the doing it;</Q><Q>so the <HI>Apostles</HI> were to settle the Orders of the <HI>Gospel Church,</HI> and were faithful to Him who appointed them</Q>— Moreover you know, how that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> directed the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and the Churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> to have their <HI>Col∣lections</HI>

<PB N="30" REF="002620_0035_0FDB72DB8003B150"/>called the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> so is the <HI>Christian Sab∣bath</HI> the <HI>Lord's day.</HI></Q> Both the one and other are instituted, separated and appropriated unto his worship, and the religious remembrance of Him∣self.— <HI>The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath,</HI> Lord of our time and lives. He has power to <HI>change</HI> the day. And there is the same reason why it should please the <HI>Lord Redeemer</HI> to take the <HI>first</HI> day of the week for his own day, and make it the weekly Sabbath to the Church, upon his <HI>Resurrection</HI> thereon from the dead; as there was why the <HI>Lord Creator</HI> pleased to bless the <HI>se∣venth</HI> day, and the seventh part of time, because he <HI>rested</HI> from his work of Creation after six days. For the work of mans <HI>Redemption</HI> is a work of God <HI>equally glorious</HI> with that of his <HI>Cre∣ation,</HI> and so <HI>equally worthy</HI> of a sacred, instituted, perpetual <HI>Memorial.</HI> And the <HI>resurrection of Christ</HI> was really his <HI>resting</HI> from his work of our re∣demption, having compleated it in his death. Nor does the <HI>change</HI> of the day of the week in the least <HI>take away</HI> from the Memorial of the Work of <HI>Creation</HI> every Sabbath day; for the <HI>seventh</HI> part of time is yet sacredly observed in Comme∣moration thereof.— Upon all therefore, We have now the <HI>same Reasons</HI> for our religious Ob∣servation of the <HI>first</HI> day of the week, that the Church of old had for their keeping holy the <HI>seventh</HI> day. The reasons to them were, God's <HI>special propriety</HI> in the seventh day, his own <HI>Ex∣ample</HI> and resting thereon, and his <HI>blessing</HI> it. And for <HI>these reasons</HI> we keep the <HI>first</HI> day of the week holy to <HI>Christ,</HI> because of his special propriety therein, (his resting on it, and taking it for his
<PB N="31" REF="002620_0036_0FDB72DE0F260570"/>own) his own Example and his blessing it. On every Account it is the <HI>Lord's day,</HI> the Christian Sabbath.— <HI>Jesus has given us this Rest,</HI> upon his <HI>ceasing</HI> from his redeeming work as <HI>God</HI> did from his of Creation; and upon <HI>his entring into his rest.</HI> There remaineth therefore <HI>a Rest</HI> to the people of God; a spiritual rest <HI>in</HI> Christ, and the keeping of a weekly Sabbath <HI>to</HI> him.</P>
<P>AND thus I have briefly traced thro' the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> some of the things occurring there, <HI>for our keeping holy the Sabbath-day.</HI>— And so I dismiss the first part of my <HI>Text, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep.</HI>— I come now to the <HI>Reason annexed,</HI> which is the other part, <HI>For it is a Sign between me and you thro'out your Generations, that I am the Lord that doth sanc∣tify you.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. D. <HI>THAT the Lord's-day, or weekly Sabbath, is a Sign between God and us, that he is the Lord our Sanctifier.</HI></P>
<P>IT is great <HI>Condescention</HI> and Grace in God to us, to annex a <HI>reason</HI> unto any of his Command∣ments. His Sovereign will is the highest rea∣son.— Yet is there much of <HI>Majesty</HI> and much <HI>Grace</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Reason, <HI>It is a Sign between me and you.</HI> And will God in very deed give us <HI>such</HI> a Sign and Token between Himself and us? will he in very deed deal <HI>so</HI> with Man upon the Earth? And give a <HI>standing</HI> Sign too, <HI>thro'out all the Generations</HI> of men on earth? O the favour and Grace to dust and ashes! while <HI>He humbleth himself to behold the things that are above!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="002620_0037_0FDB72E078AAD600"/>
BUT <HI>what</HI> is the Lord's <HI>Sabbaths</HI> a Sign of thro' all the Generations of men? Why they sig∣nify and let us know, 1. That he is the <HI>Lord</HI> and our Lord: Lord of the world, and Lord of our time and lives. The great Proprietor and absolute Disposer of them. 2. That he is the Lord <HI>our Sanctifier.</HI> This is that <HI>Glory</HI> wherein he delights to <HI>appear</HI> unto his Creatures, and for which to be <HI>adored</HI> by them. So the <HI>Seraphims</HI> worship him above, and <HI>cover their faces,</HI> crying, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts.</HI> And so we worship the Lord <HI>in the Beauties of Holiness</HI> on earth; His <HI>Sabbaths</HI> being unto us the <HI>sign,</HI> and his <HI>Ordinances</HI> the blessed <HI>means</HI> of holiness and Sanctification.</P>
<P><HI>THE Lord our Sanctifier.</HI> It speaks the utmost favour, grace and mercy <HI>to us,</HI> and the utmost holiness <HI>in the Lord our God.</HI> He is the Sanctifier of all whom he saves. His Elect are <HI>chosen unto Salvation thro' sanctification of the Spirit.</HI> And he has appointed his <HI>Holy Sabbath</HI> and all the Or∣dinances of his worship, under the blessing of his Spirit, to be the <HI>season</HI> and means of the Rege∣neration and Sanctification of souls, and of their growth and increase in Holiness.</P>
<P>GOD's <HI>Sabbaths</HI> were from the beginning of the world given for a Sign and a <HI>Memorial.</HI> They are a Sign that <HI>in six days the Lord made Heaven and earth</HI>— Our <HI>Lord's days</HI> are now a Sign of <HI>the Resurrection of Christ from the dead.</HI> And in short, both the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian Sabbath</HI> are a Sign to fallen man, of <HI>a Covenant of Grace</HI> and Salvation granted to him thro' <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> the promised <HI>seed of the Woman,</HI> but the <HI>Only Begotten of the Eternal Father.</HI></P>

TO be sure, The Observation of a <HI>weekly Sab∣bath</HI> is a very <HI>public</HI> and <HI>open</HI> thing; a thing of much Solemnity and Significancy. It is a perpe∣tual and universal Memorial of something <HI>very great and important</HI> between God and man.— Every child is ready to ask, <HI>What meaneth this Service?</HI> what signifies such a <HI>weekly</HI> Solemnity? —God answers in my Text, <HI>It is a sign between Me and you.</HI> Surely then a sign of something ve∣ry great and good on <HI>God's</HI> part, and worthy of his blessed and glorious Name, and of something very good and great, beneficial and necessary to <HI>us!</HI> Yes truly: the <HI>work</HI> and grace is great on God's part, to be our <HI>Sanctifier!</HI> the <HI>benefit</HI> and mercy vast to us, our <HI>Sanctification!</HI>— This, <HI>this</HI> is signified by the <HI>weekly Sabbath.</HI> What more worthy of the <HI>Holy</HI> God? what more important to polluted, guilty and perishing <HI>Sinners?</HI> Of his mercy he thus saves us.</P>

1. <HI>THE Lord's Sabbaths continued to fallen man, are a sign and token of the Covenant of Grace made with him in Jesus Christ.</HI> It is a sign <HI>between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and you.</HI> Here is something <HI>mutual</HI> between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parties, God and man; significant of great grace and favour to man on the part of God, and of special and holy bonds and duty to God on the part of man; Now what can this be but a <HI>faderal</HI> and Covenant stipulation? and what can it be referred unto, but only the <HI>Cove∣nant of Grace</HI> and Salvation by <HI>Jesus Christ?</HI> As∣sign something else if you can.</P>
<P>INDEED the <HI>Sabbath</HI> was given and insti∣tuted to Man in his State of Innocence, and that even before the <HI>Covenant of works</HI> was giv∣en unto <HI>Adam.</HI> But Man having <HI>sinned</HI> and broken the first Covenant, had <HI>forfeited</HI> and <HI>lost</HI> the Priviledge and honour of a Sabbath. There remained <HI>no room</HI> or place for any <HI>Sabbath</HI> to him till it was <HI>restored</HI> in the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI>— But as it pleased God, according to his Eter∣nal Counsel and purpose, immediately to <HI>reveal</HI> unto fallen man hss Covenant of Grace and Salvation, thro' <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the promised Seed of the Woman; So the <HI>Law of the Sabbath</HI> did naturally and in course <HI>revive</HI> and take place again.— For it is nothing <HI>peculiar</HI> either to the Covenant of <HI>Grace,</HI> or to the Covenant of <HI>works,</HI> that there should be a <HI>Sabbath;</HI> but it must needs be <HI>common</HI> to either, that there be some appointed <HI>time</HI> sacred unto the public and
<PB N="35" REF="002620_0040_0FDB72E904797A30"/>solemn worship of God.— IF then God pleased to give a <HI>new Covenant</HI> to Man after his fall, it must needs bring him a <HI>new Right and liberty</HI> to worship God; and consequently must revive the Priviledge and Law of a Sab∣bath to him.— And <HI>other Foundation can no man lay,</HI> for this priviledge and liberty of Wor∣ship, than <HI>this</HI> which is laid, <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> in and thro' him. It is truly <HI>one</HI> of the Benefits of Redemption, and a <HI>great</HI> and necessary one. It is the <HI>Gift of Grace by Jesus Christ;</HI> it is the purchase of his <HI>Death,</HI> and the fruit of his <HI>Resurrection,</HI> that there <HI>re∣maineth the keeping of a Sabbath</HI> to the Children of fallen <HI>Adam.</HI>— This is a Benefit of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> without which there had remain∣ed <HI>no place</HI> for prayer, praise or worship to fallen man; and consequently <HI>no day</HI> sacred to these Duties.</P>
<P>HENCE the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is said to be given <HI>for a Covenant,</HI> and to be observed as such; and the <HI>ten Commandments</HI> are called God's <HI>Covenant:</HI> Deu. 4.13. <HI>He declared unto you his Covenant; even ten Commandments.</HI> But it is the <HI>fourth Com∣mandment</HI> which stands peculiarly as the <HI>most</HI> visible token of the Covenant of God; accor∣ding to the 16. <HI>v.</HI> of our <HI>Context, Ye shall ob∣serve the Sabbath for a perpetual Covenant.</HI> And <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20.20. <HI>It is a sign between me and you, that I am the Lord your God.</HI>— Every Sabbath day we do publickly and solemnly confess and avouch the <HI>Lord Jehovah</HI> to be the <HI>true</HI> God, and
<PB N="36" REF="002620_0041_0FDB72EA91B0C730"/>God <HI>alone,</HI> and that he is <HI>our God and Redeemer,</HI> and that we are <HI>his</HI> people and worshippers, and will be devoted to him for ever. These <HI>two</HI> things are therefore put together by the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> Isa. 56.4, 6. <HI>The keeping God's Sab∣baths,</HI> the <HI>taking hold of his Covenant,</HI> and the <HI>joyning our selves unto the Lord.</HI>— We keep God's Sabbaths as a sign of our faith in and devotion to the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> as the great <HI>Cre∣ator</HI> and High Possessor of heaven and earth. According to what we read in my <HI>Context, v.</HI> 17. <HI>It is sign between Me and the Children of Israel for ever, that in six days the Lord made all things, and in the seventh he rested and was refresh∣ed.</HI>— Again, We covenant with God thro' <HI>Christ,</HI> as the Lord our <HI>Redeemer,</HI> in our keep∣ing his Sabbaths. It was to the Church of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> and is to the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> a Memorial of <HI>redeeming</HI> Grace and Mercy. When God had redeemed <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> he then said to them, Deut. 5.15. <HI>Remember that thou wast a Servant there, and that the Lord thy God bro't thee out thence with a strong hand and by a stretched out arm; Therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.</HI> Here was a super-added and special reason to <HI>Israel</HI> for their religious observation of the Sabbath. Some learned men have argued and insisted on it, that the <HI>seventh</HI> day from the Overthrow of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> at the Red Sea was the <HI>Jewish Sabbath.</HI> And if it were so yet might it be the seventh day from the <HI>Creation</HI> also. But to be sure, in memory of this <HI>their Redemption,</HI> as well as of the <HI>World's
<PB N="37" REF="002620_0042_0FDB72EBFA7608B0"/>Creation,</HI> they were to keep their Sabbaths.— Now <HI>this</HI> seems to me a plain Prefiguration of our <HI>Christian Sabbath,</HI> in memory of <HI>Christ's</HI> fi∣nishing the work of <HI>our</HI> Redemption. For if the Sabbath was unto the <HI>Jews</HI> a sign of their Covenant relation and obligations to God as <HI>their Saviour</HI> and Redeemer; is it not more <HI>so</HI> unto <HI>us</HI> under the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and from the day of the completion of the Spiritual and Eternal Re∣demption by the <HI>Son of God?</HI> If that deliverance which was but the <HI>Type</HI> came into a constant Remembrance, and was a standing reason of the weekly Sabbath till the Resurrection of <HI>Christ;</HI> shall not the <HI>Eternal Redemption</HI> by Him, which is the <HI>Substance,</HI> be had in a perpetual Remembrance <HI>by us</HI> upon the weekly Sabbath; and be a special reason <HI>to us</HI> for our Sanctify∣ing the same?— Wherefore no doubt but from the <HI>fall</HI> of Man unto the End of the world, the Sabbath has been ordained, and by the worshippers of God ought to be observed, in memory of Man's Redemption as well as of his Creation, and to the honour of God our <HI>Redeemer</HI> as well as <HI>Creator;</HI> and so we keep it, as a redeemed people, bought with his Blood; and every <HI>Lord's-day</HI> we covenant anew with our <HI>Saviour,</HI> to glorify him in our bodies and spirits which are his.— The <HI>Covenant</HI> stands for ever, because the <HI>Redeemer</HI> liveth, therefore the <HI>Sabbath</HI> abides: The <HI>Covenant of his peace</HI> is not removed, and the <HI>God of the whole Earth</HI> is he called, who is the <HI>Holy One of Israel,</HI> the Redeemer.— God openly and
<PB N="38" REF="002620_0043_0FDB72F438B4F3D8"/>significantly <HI>covenants</HI> with his Church and peo∣ple every Sabbath day. He meets them to <HI>bless</HI> 'em, as they assemble to <HI>worship</HI> him. He gives <HI>a name and place within his walls, even an ever∣lasting name.</HI> He does this (says the <HI>Prophet</HI>) Isa. 56.6. while <HI>we joyn our selves unto him, to serve him and to love his Name.</HI>— Where∣fore <HI>God</HI> owns his people, as well as <HI>they</HI> him, every <HI>Lord's-day.</HI> He meets them in his own appointed time and ways. He <HI>seals</HI> to his Co∣venant, and <HI>shews</HI> it to them, and his <HI>secret</HI> is with them while they <HI>keep</HI> his Sabbath.— The risen <HI>Saviour</HI> visits his assembled Disciples from week to week, and is still in the <HI>midst</HI> of them, and says, <HI>peace</HI> be unto you; yea and shews them <HI>his hands and his feet</HI> when they come to∣gether to <HI>break bread.</HI>— Thus the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is the abiding and conspicuous Sign of a <HI>Church state;</HI> and it is for <HI>Stipulation</HI> and mutual Cove∣nanting between God and his people.— <HI>It is a sign between Me and you.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is an evident token, and blessed means, of Man's Salvation in a way of holiness and sancti∣fication. That I am the Lord that sanctifieth you.</HI> A parallel place we have, Ezek. 20.12. <HI>More∣over also I gave them my Sabbaths to be a Sign be∣tween me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify them.</HI>— This, <HI>this</HI> is at last the thing <HI>signified,</HI> the thing <HI>cove∣nanted.</HI> God covenants with his people to be <HI>their Sanctifier</HI> in their observation of <HI>his Sab∣baths;</HI> they covenant to be holy to him and
<PB N="39" REF="002620_0044_0FDB72F43A8D9408"/>to seek his sanctifying grace, and live as his sanctified Ones.</P>
<P>GOD's Sabbaths were to the <HI>Jews</HI> a sign of his selecting them from other people and consecrating them unto himself, his worship and service; to be unto him as <HI>a kingdom of priests, a holy nation.</HI> If he had not so <HI>set 'em apart</HI> for himself, he would not have <HI>revealed</HI> to them his Sabbaths, to <HI>set up</HI> his Worship a∣mong them: And they that worship him must be <HI>sanctified,</HI> must sanctify themselves hereunto.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, The Observation of the <HI>Sab∣bath</HI> ever was, is and will be, a special <HI>means</HI> of the Sanctification of God's Elect. He sancti∣fies them by his <HI>Spirit</HI> in his Word and Ordi∣nances, the Means of grace and holiness, where∣in his <HI>Sabbaths</HI> are sanctified, and wherein his people apply to him as their <HI>Sanctifier.</HI> If we keep <HI>God's days,</HI> they will be the means of <HI>our sanctification.</HI> It is a sign that God has sancti∣fied us if we love his Sabbaths; and to keep them is the grand means of our increase in holiness.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Holy Sabbaths</HI> of God do exhibit him unto us, not only as the Lord our <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Redeemer,</HI> but also as the Lord our <HI>Sancti∣fier.</HI> Not only is the Sabbath ordained to serve unto the honour and worship of God <HI>the Father Almighty,</HI> Maker of Heaven and Earth; and of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> his only Son our Saviour, but also
<PB N="40" REF="002620_0045_0FDB72F628CFB930"/>of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> (proceeding from the Father and the Son) our Sanctifier.</P>
<P>SANCTIFICATION is the special work of the <HI>Holy and Eternal Spirit of God.</HI> In remem∣brance of <HI>his glorious descent</HI> from the Ascended Saviour we keep our <HI>Lord's days.</HI> He is in his Word and Ordinances, the which he has in∣spired and instituted, and makes them the ef∣fectual means of holiness unto all sincere and fervent Worshippers.</P>
<P>HE is himself the <HI>Holy One,</HI> infinitly holy. He would have <HI>us</HI> holy. He only can make us so. His <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and worship are holy, and <HI>sanctifying</HI> to us. We wait on him in them <HI>for</HI> his sanctifying influences and Operations. He <HI>blesses</HI> his Sabbaths and Institutions for this end. He sanctifies his Elect <HI>thro' his Truth,</HI> his Word is the Truth. We acknowledge him as the Lord our Sanctifier, <HI>apply</HI> to him and glorify him as such, in the <HI>way</HI> of Sabbath Sanctification. And they that do so, <HI>find</HI> him to be their Sanc∣tifier. His Sabbaths are under his blessing the special means of that <HI>little Holiness</HI> that is in the world. Not only is the <HI>form</HI> of Godliness kept up in the world by the keeping the Sab∣bath day, but also that <HI>power</HI> of Godliness which is, or ever has been, in the Church of God, is owing hereunto. In this way Sinners must <HI>seek</HI> after Sanctification, and in this way they experience and <HI>find</HI> it. As it is written in the <HI>Psalm or Song for the Sabbath-day;</HI> Ps. 92.13.
<PB N="41" REF="002620_0046_0FDB72F74D1E4E90"/><HI>They that be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts of our God; to shew that▪ the Lord is upright;—</HI> A God <HI>faithful</HI> to his Covenant and <HI>true</HI> to his Institutions, to own and bless them.</P>
<P>AND thus I have offer'd some <HI>hints</HI> toward the explaining my <HI>Text,</HI> How the <HI>Sabbaths</HI> of God are a <HI>sign</HI> between Him and his people, <HI>that he is the Lord that doth sanctify them.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Argument</HI> from all is, <HI>That verily his Sabbaths we must keep.</HI> And you may easily perceive a <HI>variety</HI> of Argument, cogent and very weighty, in what has been said.— The <HI>Lord's day</HI> is unto us the primary, perpetual and universal Memorial of the Covenant of Grace, which God has made with fallen man; and shall we not thankfully and religiously cele∣brate the Memorial of this Grace of God unto us?— It is the badge and livery of our being the Covenant People of God; our pub∣lic and solemn Confession of the <HI>Lord Jehovah,</HI> Father Son and Holy Ghost, our glorious Cre∣ator, Redeemer and Sanctifier.— It is the great and solemn Profession of our Faith in, our devotion unto, and our covenanting with, the <HI>most High God,</HI> Possessor of heaven and earth.— It is the instituted Means to us of Grace here and Glory for ever; of present Communion with God and of seeing him here∣after; of his having any service and glory from us in this world, and of our finding blessedness in him in that which is to come.</P>
