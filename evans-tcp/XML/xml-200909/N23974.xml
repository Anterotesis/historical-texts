<HEAD>An ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have differed in nothing more than in their religious opinions. Their creeds have been as various as their coun∣tenances. Education has no small share in pro∣ducing this wonderful variety. We are passive to its influence.</P>
<P>Religion, of some kind or other, has been ac∣knowledged by all mankind, in all ages, and in all parts of the globe. It has been considered as the most noble employment of the soul, and pro∣ductive of the most beneficial consequences to civil society. These things have occurred, al∣though most of the religions extant owe their ex∣istence more to ignorance than to argument, and are more the effects of blind credulity, than rea∣sonable conviction. This arises from the nature of the subject. Our religion is formed before the reasoning faculties are sufficiently matured for examination. Principles imbibed in infancy are extremely difficult to be eradicated. They grow with our growth, they strengthen with our strength. Here commences the boasted empire of conscience, whose dictates it is thought the highest criminality to violate. There is some∣thing too in the subject of religion so solemn and awful, that we dare scarcely attempt to reason ourselves out of pre-established errors. A dread of something hereafter, the hopes of happier days, rush upon the anxious soul, and disarm it of its reasoning power. Men in all ages have been the subjects of religious fear. Immoderate
<PB N="4" REF="031712_0003_0FEE15E995F4E538"/>forebodings of a world <HI>to come,</HI> have robbed the <HI>present</HI> of half its lawful enjoyments.</P>
<P>Religion, designed to render man "mild and sociable to man," has rendered him selfish and implacable. Absurdities and persecutions have been the attendants of every system of religion under heaven. How often have the rights and dignity of human nature been insulted, degraded and trampled upon? How often have the honour and character of Deity been traduced, by the im∣pious and absurd doctrines of religious establish∣ments? How often have mankind been deceived and led astray from truth, by systems bearing on∣ly the <HI>name</HI> of Divinity? How often has the sa∣cred name of Jehovah been insulted by men act∣ing under the specious appearance of superior piety? These abuses, with many others commit∣ted under the mask of religious hypocrisy, have induced some to reject all revelation, as repug∣nant to reason; imposing on the ignorance and credulity of the vulgar; degrading the exalted abilities of man, and inconsistent with the charac∣ter of Deity. They either artfully insinuate, or openly declare, that the religion of a Saviour stands on the same foundation with that of a Ma∣homet, and the fables of antiquity. They insist that ignorance and imposition are equally the supporters of all. They renounce all the lumin∣ous truths of revelation; they place in their stead the forlorn "age of reason." They aim their wit and ridicule at the very existence of Chris∣tianity, and treat with impious and ungenerous contempt that life and immortality brought to light by the gospel. They rob virtue of her hope. They add insult to the misfortunes of life. They transform the beauties of Paradise into the barren wilds of non-existence. They plant on the grave the seeds of annihilation. They level man with the brute. Destined, like a meteor of the night, to blaze for a moment, he vanishes
<PB N="5" REF="031712_0004_0FEE15EB1F228520"/>forever in the shades of darkness. To-day he exults in the highest glory; to-morrow he min∣gles with the worm in the dust.</P>
<P>Man, as a being prone to err, becomes an ob∣ject of commiseration. Ridicule is a breach of humanity; it is oftering violence to the feel∣ings of the human heart. We will shed the tear of sorrow over the tomb of man's departed glo∣ry; but let us not deprive him of that religion which alone can alleviate the misfortunes of life.</P>
<P>While men have been pleading an universal toleration of religious opinions, we rejoiced at their success; we saw them disarming persecution of her weapons; we imbibed their sympathy; we warmed with their philanthropy. That elegance of style and independency of thought which charac∣terize the writings of some who have opposed reve∣lation, have in some instances captivated the passions and seduced the judgment. They have with great exultation vilified the character of the clergy. We are sensible of ecclesiastical abuses; they cannot be too much exposed: but while we deprecate the ambition of the clergy, so destructive to the peace of civil society, when strengthened by the arm of the magistrate, let us not abuse indiscrimi∣nately an order of men so important and useful to mankind. Society, in an improved state, cannot exist without them. Though they form the mind and mend the heart, yet some, either from ignorance or envy, have represented them as unfriendly to the improvements of the human mind—to the lights and progress of philosophy. We feel ourselves peculi∣arly pleased and honoured in appealing to the pre∣sent occasion, as a full refutation of their illiberal aspersions. Those venerable Worthies, whose pre∣fence gives dignity and respect to the ceremonies of this day; whose benevolence is at this moment listening to the feeble efforts of the speaker, rise su∣perior to the insinuations of malice, and sufficient∣ly evince their attachment to science and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031712_0005_0FEE15C5681CC0C8"/>
But what have the systems and errors of men to do with the religion of heaven? We renounce all systems but the system of God. Men, in support∣ing their favourite opinions, have undoubtedly been led into error. This by no means derogates from truth. While we smile at the incomprehen∣sible commentaries of system-builders, our vene∣ration for the great original is increased. Like its divine Author, it cannot be destroyed. Heav∣en and earth shall pass away, and nature dissolve at the feet of Jehovah—but religion exists for∣ever.</P>
<P>As a system coming from heaven, with every mark of its divinity, it ought to influence our be∣lief and actions. But, say some, the belief of the Christian scriptures is no proof of their truth and importance. Because, continue the objectors, the same proof is applicable to every system of er∣ror extant. This will be granted. Things are either true or false, independent of belief. "Man cannot create, he can only discover."</P>
<P>But the credence of false systems of religions, is no proof or argument against one which carries indelible characters of its divinity. It rather heightens its value. Virtue never more interests the heart than when contrasted with vice. To reject <HI>all</HI> truth, merely because we are liable to err, is the height of absurdity. Man, it is true, is from his cradle exposed to deception. This by no means argues him destitute of knowledge. Admit this reasoning to be just, and you not only destroy the credibility of revealed religion, but you strike at the root of all knowledge, and level man's boasted acquirements in the dust.</P>
<P>The weakness of human reason to determine on many things in morals and religion, points out to man the necessity of some superior guide, of some unerring standard, to which he may refer his ac∣tions, and appreciate their worth. The very idea of man's moral agency involves in it the suppo∣sition
<PB N="7" REF="031712_0006_0FEE15ECA791CA90"/>of laws to ascertain and govern his actions. From whom can those laws originate, but the Le∣gislator of the Universe? If God govern the natu∣ral world by universal laws, why not the moral? The same necessity is evident in both. The pro∣mulgation of these laws is the revelation we plead for. The necessity and importance of such a reve∣lation becomes a serious and all-interesting enqui∣ry. It involves in it man's present and future happiness.</P>
<P>The great end Deity had in view, in delivering to man a transcript of his mind, was to make known to him his true character; to teach him in what his real happiness consists; to confirm the wishes of his heart in immortality; to offer the greatest incentives to virtue, the greatest deter∣ments from vice, by establishing the doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments. The in∣comprehensibility of some parts of revelation has, with great force and dependence, been urged as an insuperable objection to their veracity. It re∣mains for those who make the objection to prove this peculiar to revelation.</P>
<P>As well might we reject the truth of our own existence, because we cannot comprehend the laws of animal motion. Shall we disbelieve the existence of all those magnificent scenes disclosed to our view throughout the works of creation, because we cannot comprehend <HI>all</HI> the laws by which they are governed? Man, after all his won∣derful discoveries, will find more to admire than to comprehend—more to animate his devotion than to confirm his unbelief.</P>
<P>This, so far from being an argument against the truth of revelation, is one of the greatest in its favour. If man had been its author, would it not in every respect have been within the sphere of his comprehension? Like all the works of man, whe∣ther of genius or imitation, it might have been perfectly understood.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="031712_0007_0FEE15C19DFF8120"/>
In a revelation coming from heaven, we can∣not expect, in the present state of existence, fully to comprehend all its designs. The weakness of human reason is such, as to render us totally un∣qualified to scan the counsels of the Divinity.</P>
<P>That there are many things beyond the com∣prehension of the human mind, is the experience of philosophy. The Christian scriptures are not a singular case. Omniscience is an attribute of Deity only. It is sufficient for man he can learn his duty, and motives powerful enough to prompt him to its performance. Revelation contains both in an eminent degree. All knowledge flows from God. The mind that can fully comprehend the anatomy of a fly, is equal to the knowledge of the universe. The power that can give animation to a mite, can with the same ease move unnum∣bered worlds.</P>
<P>Astonished at the wonderful discoveries made in the philosophic world, some have supposed revelation to be superfluous. Philosophy, it is true, discloses to us ten thousand scenes, all beautiful; all magnificent; all sublime. Af∣frsted by science, man has read the great volume of creation; he has triumphed over the elements; he has rendered the laws of nature obedient to his will. But however extensive man's researches may be; however he may have improved his mind or exalted his nature by the lights of reason and philosophy; yet, assisted by these alone, all his prospects, all his expectations, terminate in uncertainty. Clouds and darkness hover over the regions of the grave. We mark man's entrance into life; we observe the developement of his genius, in all his wonderful discoveries; we fol∣low him to the tomb—but, destitute of the light of revelation, we lose him forever.</P>
<P>The disposition of Deity towards man, in par∣doning his sins, and restoring him to future hap∣piness, can never be discovered by the efforts of
<PB N="9" REF="031712_0008_0FEE15FB17B682C8"/>reason, however improved by philosophy, or matured by experience. The history of ages proves to us the uncertainty in which the light of nature and the sagacity of philosophy leave man, with respect to a future existence.</P>
<P>The human mind, long before the dawn of the Christian aera, had arrived at an astonishing de∣gree of refinement. Poets had reached the height of sublimity, orators had harangued in all the ve∣hemence of eloquence, philosophers had taught the principles of morality; but the great problem of man's immortality remained unsolved. It was reserved for revelation to demonstrate the truth of man's resurrection. Her energising voice awakes the slumbers of the tombs. She gives to man a new creation. She proclaims him the heir of immortal glory. Situated in the midst of gaz∣ing worlds, he interests the feelings of all that bright train which bow before the burning throne of God.</P>
<P>The prospects of man are great—his happiness inviolate. Deity has distinguished him as an ob∣ject of his peculiar beneficence and attention. He has stamped on him the seal of his divinity. His progress in science and religion proves the in∣finite perfectibility of his mind. Erect in stature, man seems formed for contemplating all the beau∣tiful and sublime works of nature. Although an inhabitant of earth, his wishes reach beyond the stars. The glittering portals of heaven lie wide extended for man's reception. The shades of ignorance and tyrannic gloom, which have so long beclouded the prospects of man, are vanishing before him. Wafted on the wing of inspiration, we hail the period as not far distant, when the religion of peace and good-will shall emancipate man, and give to the universe the highest possible happiness.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="address">
<HEAD>I. <HI>To the</HI> CORPORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN retiring from the place of our education, gratitude demands our acknowledg∣ments to the honourable Corporation.</P>
<P>If to form the mind to virtue and knowledge, is an object of the first magnitude in a free state, what respect is due to the founders and patrons of this flourishing institution! Your benevolent exertions in the cause of science and religion, merit the eulogium of every friend of humanity, but more especially of us, who this day receive the honours of this University. To you, Gen∣tlemen, are due the first fruits of all our toils. It is to you, ye friends of science and freedom, we owe the birth of that institution which calls us her sons. This renders your names and your virtues dear to our memories. Sensible of the importance and necessity of a general diffusion of knowledge in a republican government; ac∣tuated by the noble principles of patriotism and philanthropy, you have founded and fostered to its present respectability you asylum of the arts and sciences. Your exertions have not been in vain. Under your patronage, and the blessings of an approving heaven, each returning anni∣versary
<PB N="11" REF="031712_0010_0FEE15EE30E40D60"/>has rewarded your toils, and animated your zeal.</P>
<P>Go on, generous Sirs, in your laudable un∣dertakings; perfect the important designs of your institution, and immortalize your names.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="address">
<HEAD>II. <HI>To the</HI> CHANCELLOR.</HEAD>
<P>WITH sentiments of the highest esteem we turn to the honourable Chancellor of the College. We come to offer him the spontaneous effusions of our hearts. Deign, worthy Sir, to accept this small tribute of gratitude.</P>
<P>Superior merit and distinguished virtues com∣mand our respect and veneration. To whom are they more justly due, than to him who is ho∣noured with the most dignified rank among the worthy patrons of this feat of literature?</P>
<P>He who patronizes the arts and sciences, be∣comes the benefactor of mankind. We know your zeal and exertions in the cause of educa∣tion and freedom. The interest and welfare of this institution lie near your heart. May its fu∣ture prosperity be equal to your benevolent wishes. May ever be blessed by the guar∣dianship of such illustrious worthies. We hope the patronage of a character so influential, will become an example of imitation to the worthy citizens of Rhode-Island.—Then shall our Alma Mater rejoice in the number of her <HI>native</HI> sons, and receive the patronage of the Legislature. Your rewards shall then be the gratitude of an enlightened people, and the approbation of the Judge of the Universe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="address">
<HEAD>III. <HI>To the</HI> PRESIDENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PARTIAL as we are to the place of our edu∣cation; warm as our bosoms glow with love and gratitude to you, for your attention and solici∣tude
<PB N="12" REF="031712_0011_0FEE15C9B192F2D0"/>in advancing our literary acquirements and future prosperity; we do not wish to intrude on your feelings, by a public recital of your many virtues, of which few of your acquaintance, none of this society, can be ignorant. But we cannot conceal our attachment and veneration for the man who has been our affectionate friend and literary guide. It is to you we are indebted for those lessons of wisdom and morality, which add dignity to our natures, and sensibility to our feelings. You have unbarred to us the gates of glory.—You have presented to our minds religion in all her God-like excellencies. Ne∣ver shall the cold hand of <HI>unbelief</HI> chill those bo∣soms which have been warmed with your persuasive devotion.</P>
<P>Your paternal tenderness, so soothing to our bosoms, shall never be forgotten. Accept, dear Sir, our unfeigned thanks for your many kind offices. To deserve your future friendship and patronage is the first wish of our hearts. While the finger of science directs the sons of Co∣lumbia to yon seat of the Muses, may no de∣mon of discord enter those peaceful walls where our best friend presides. Long, Sir, may you continue the father of this rising institution—a guide to our youth—an ornament of religion, and the admiration of an enlightened age.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="address">
<HEAD>IV. <HI>To the</HI> PROFESSORS <HI>and</HI> TUTORS.</HEAD>
<P>TO the worthy Professors and Tutors is just∣ly due the tribute of gratitude. In looking back on the past scenes of collegiate life, we behold you, Gentlemen, alluring us through the de∣lightful walks of science and refinement. You have animated us in the pursuit of virtue and knowledge by your own amiable examples and extensive acquirements. If we have not improv∣ed, it cannot be imputed to your want of atten∣tion.
<PB N="13" REF="031712_0012_0FED37C7073AB540"/>You have on all occasions convinced us of the necessity and importance of acquiring and maintaining characters fair and unfullied. May our future conduct in life never disappoint the benevolent wishes of your hearts. We can ne∣ver sufficiently admire those talents and virtues, which have been so zealously devoted to our best interest. That respect and esteem you have taught us to entertain for the great and the good, we feel in a pre-eminent degree for you. This, Gen∣tlemen, is not the language of adulation, but the sentiments of those, who wish to express the feelings of their hearts. Time will not permit us to trespass on your patience, by relating the many favours you have conferred on us. Fare∣well, ye guardians of our education; may the best of heaven's blessings reward your virtues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="address">
<HEAD>V. <HI>To the</HI> STUDENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE interest we feel in your welfare, who are to follow us in those peaceful walks of litera∣ture, will not permit us to part from you in si∣lence. You, fellow Students, still inhabit you edifice dedicated to the genius of man. You are still the votaries of science. Never will you behold more tranquil moments; enjoy them ra∣tionally, and you must be happy.</P>
<P>Your time at this period of life is doubly va∣luable. Its wise improvement will add a splen∣dour to your rising sun. Let this consideration animate you to pursue with unremitting atten∣tion your literary studies. Let each day behold you advancing in virtue and knowledge. In youth ten thousand fascinating charms captivate the passions, and divert the mind from the nobler pursuits of science. These can be overcome by resolution and perseverance only. Render each moment subservient to the great objects now in view. You are placed here by the affection of
<PB N="14" REF="031712_0013_0FEE15DA69FCC780"/>parents, whose wishes and expectations are deep∣ly interested in your present and future respecta∣bility. Let them not be disappointed.</P>
<P>Encourage a noble ambition, which scorns the low arts of envy, or the secret insinuations of de∣traction. Let not a competition of interest weak∣en or diminish your friendship. The great man's glory is in the rewards of virtue and excellency. Let your hearts be ever open and ready to re∣ceive the advice of your instructors. The coun∣sels of the aged are experience in anticipation.</P>
<P>In parting with you, our feelings are sup∣ported by the pleasing reflection, that the field of science you are now exploring is happily cal∣culated to alleviate a further separation from the arms and society of your friends. We now, young Gentlemen, bid you adieu, wishing you may do honour to the place of your education, and receive the approbation of a grateful country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="address">
<HEAD>VI. <HI>To the</HI> GRADUATES.</HEAD>
<P>WITH a heart filled with the tenderest emo∣tions, I now address a society with whom I have participated in the most friendly intercourse; in whose arms and attachment I have passed the happiest moments of my life; with whom I have formed a connexion in pursuits the most ho∣norary to our natures, and useful to mankind. We have enjoyed in common the pleasures and advantages of science and philosophy. But these scenes, so pleasing to the youthful mind, are soon to be closed. The time set apart and de∣voted to our education is measured and com∣pleted. A new day advances with haste, to light us to the bosom of our country. The de∣lightful retreats of philosophic repose are to be exchanged for the rights and duties of civil so∣ciety. This to us becomes an all-important pe∣riod; while it terminates our residence in the
<PB N="15" REF="031712_0014_0FEE15B0ABF042B0"/>school of classic erudition, it gives us admission on the wide theatre of the world. We become citizens of an enlightened nation. Let us carry with us into its bosom those lessons of patriot∣ism and freedom we have been taught in the shades of the academic grove. Let our future lives, as citizens and as men, be worthy the place of our education. May those who have with parental care guided the steps of our youth, rejoice in our future usefulness to mankind. We cannot deny them this small recompence. May our lives be ever governed by the great lights of reason and revelation. Then shall we meet these our friends beyond the narrow tide of time, where sighing and sorrow shall be no more, and tears shall be wiped from all faces. Ani∣mated by this heart-cheering prospect, set us put∣in the career of unlimited improvement. The God of boundless love will never suffer the won∣derful acquirements of man to sleep in the cold bed of death. Each improvement we make in virtue, each acquisition we gain in science, will be treading the courts of immortality.</P>
<P>Although separated as we soon shall be by re∣turning to our homes—yet by indulging a retro∣spective view of the sciences we have studied to∣gether, of the pleasures we have enjoyed in each other's society, and the friendships we have here contracted, shall we not daily meet in yon retreat of the Muses, and steal ourselves from the cares of a busy world? Yes, my Class-Mates, the re∣collection of your friendship and tenderness shall often, through the varied scenes of future life, excite the tear of sympathy and love. Your friendly images are too deeply engraved on the tablets of my heart for time ever to erase. Re∣ceive, dear Brothers, my best wishes for your future happiness. May the gentle breath of peace forever attend you. But why should we, in the
<PB N="16" REF="031712_0015_0FEE15BA45430008"/>midst of this listening and sympathising audience, recount our attachments, or renew the sincerity of our friendship? They are not insensible of our feelings. They can witness to the reluctance of our parting.</P>
<P>But time hastens us to perform the most pleasing and affecting scene of this day's anniversary.</P>
<P>To you, ye Companions of my youthful days, I now appeal for a description of sensations with which my heart is agitated.</P>
<P>I must bid you a long, perhaps to some of you —an eternal adieu!. Let not our separation weak∣en or break the cords of friendship and love.</P>
<P>I have now arrived at the most trying scene my duty has ever called me to perform. The curtain of separation is fast drawing. One more moment dissolves forever our collegiate connexion. With the sincerity of a friend, the love of a brother, and the benediction of heaven, I wish you all an af∣fectionate FAREWELL!</P>
