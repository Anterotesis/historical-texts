<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> INTRODƲCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N a late <HI>Dissertation</HI> on the <HI>three first Chapters of Genesis,</HI> I pass'd over the <HI>Subject</HI> now before me, with a Design (by the Will of God) to give it a more <HI>distinct</HI> and full Con∣sideration by it self. <HI>This</HI> I now present unto the Publick, hoping it may be of some <HI>Use</HI> and not unacceptable, to <HI>Them</HI> especially whose spiritual Profit has been the Duty and Aim of my Studies and Ministry. And the less I am like to visit and converse with them in my <HI>advancing Years,</HI> the rather would I now and then put into their Hands some of the <HI>Meditations</HI> they have heard with Patience and Pleasure, and in which when I am dead I may <HI>yet speak</HI> to 'em. And if this <HI>Apology</HI> displease any, and pro∣voke <HI>Reflections</HI> public or private, they will not much move me.</P>

<HI>Man</HI> in his first Estate, and so <HI>Angels</HI> in theirs, were very much made for <HI>Contemplation</HI> and <HI>Admi∣ration.</HI> And <HI>these</HI> are very much the Exercise, Pleasure and Improvement of <HI>renewed</HI> and enlight∣ned Minds under the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Admiration</HI> seems the first Affection of an <HI>Intelli∣gent Creature,</HI> both in the Order of Nature and of Time; and of special Use and Influence in the ra∣tional, moral and <HI>Divine Life.</HI> We may suppose <HI>Adam</HI> was struck with vast and a most pleasing <HI>Ad∣miration</HI> upon his first coming into Being. What a <HI>World of Wonders</HI> presented it self before his Eyes! how many strange and beautiful <HI>Objects</HI> surrounded him! which should he first gaze at, which most ad∣mire! and most of all (it may be) did he survey and wonder at <HI>Himself!</HI> <Q>Who and what am I? whence came I into this Form and Circumstances, and with these Powers of Mind and Body? what glorious Wisdom Power and Goodness has made me thus, and all these Things about me?</Q></P>
<P>Such we may suppose were the Emotions of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Mind, upon his first View of his <HI>Paradise,</HI> the living <HI>Creatures</HI> about him, and of the <HI>Heavens</HI> over him. In the midst of which holy Astonishment he fell into a <HI>Trance,</HI> and awak'd with a <HI>new Object</HI> before him, more the <HI>Wonder</HI> and Desire of his Eyes than all that he had seen before! It was <HI>Eve,</HI> form'd in the same <HI>Image and Likeness of God</HI> that he saw and felt within himself. How did he gaze on this <HI>crowning Gift</HI> of Heaven to him! <Q><HI>This is now Bone of my Bone, and Flesh of my Flesh;</HI> said he, <HI>She shall be called Woman.</HI></Q>— Immediately God bro't the long Train of <HI>living Creatures,</HI> in beauteous Order, before their <HI>Earthly Lord</HI> and Owner, to give them <HI>Names</HI> according to their various Kind and Nature. What a <HI>Scene</HI> of Admiration was this to <HI>Adam</HI> and also to the <HI>Angels</HI> of God! to see an
<PB N="iii" REF="004001_0006_100373A519E1ABE0"/>imbodied Spirit, like <HI>Themselves</HI> in the Image of God for Knowledge, endowed with an <HI>Insight</HI> into the various Workmanship of God below, into the exquisite Perfection of every Form, the End &amp; Use of every living Thing! Thus his <HI>first</HI> Act of De∣votion to his <HI>Maker</HI> was Admiration, which justifies the Wisdom of the <HI>Schools,</HI> who have made it the first of the <HI>Passions.</HI> It certainly is so, and <HI>ever</HI> was. But in our present <HI>fallen</HI> State, in how <HI>low and feeble</HI> a manner is the <HI>first Exercise</HI> hereof in our <HI>Infancy!</HI> in what unknown sort of <HI>Confusion</HI> are the <HI>first</HI> No∣tices of Things now received by us! The state of <HI>Infancy</HI> had no doubt been vastly better in a state of <HI>Innocence,</HI> and the <HI>Perception</HI> of Things incompara∣bly faster, more distinct, and exquisitely pleasant; as the <HI>Christal Glass</HI> drinks in the Light and is irra∣diated.</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> has made all his wonderful Works to be ad∣mired; to <HI>be sought out with Pleasure</HI> by all rational Beings. He has made <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Men</HI> to admire them and give him Glory. This is their <HI>Worship</HI> and Praise to God, and their own <HI>Improvement</HI> in Knowledge and Goodness—It had been the im∣mediate <HI>Sin and Fall</HI> of our first Parents, without their eating of the <HI>forbidden Fruit,</HI> yea before <HI>that</HI> was forbidden to them, if the <HI>first</HI> Affection and Exercise of their Mind had not been a religious re∣verend <HI>Admiration</HI> of God, in Themselves, the Heavens and Earth, and in all the living Creatures about them. And holy Admiration still <HI>is,</HI> ever <HI>has been</HI> and ever <HI>will be,</HI> the Imployment and Felicity of Angels and Saints in the <HI>heavenly Places.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There</HI> are the <HI>Objects</HI> of Admiration which <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard,</HI> neither can they <HI>enter into the Heart of Man to conceive of;</HI> And the <HI>An∣gels of Heaven</HI> have greater Capacities and Powers to <HI>look into</HI> the Wisdom Power and Goodness of God in all his Works: How then do we think that
<PB N="iv" REF="004001_0007_1003588AF9D5CD28"/><HI>They admir'd</HI> and ador'd, look'd on the <HI>Divine Glory</HI> and on one another, and <HI>shouted together</HI> in the Day of their <HI>own</HI> Creation! And again we read, that in the Day they saw our <HI>Earth</HI> come into its Place Form and Motion, with <HI>Man</HI> and all the Creatures <HI>under his feet</HI> thereon, those <HI>Morning Stars sang all together</HI> the Praises of God. How did they admire the Descent of the IMMENSE SPIRIT <HI>on the Face of the Deep,</HI> to bring a World of <HI>Order</HI> and Beauty out of that dark <HI>Void,</HI> and Abysse of confused Mat∣ter! With what awful Reverence and vast Ex∣pectation did they attend and listen, when God com∣manded <HI>the Light to shine out of Darkness!</HI> tho' they were most acquainted with <HI>Light</HI> before, dwelling in the Fulness of it, <HI>in Light unapprochable</HI> by us, where the Light of the <HI>Sun</HI> is not needed, and compar'd with which it is but a <HI>Shade!</HI> Yet they saw <HI>our</HI> Light was <HI>good,</HI> inexpressibly good <HI>for us,</HI> and they admir'd the <HI>dividing</HI> it from the Darkness. They saw the <HI>Firmament,</HI> that vast Expanse of <HI>Air</HI> and Region of Light and Darkness, a Shadow to Hu∣mane Eyes of the inconceivable <HI>Immensity</HI> of God, <HI>filling all in all</HI> thro' this his seen Universe. They beheld from on High the forming of our <HI>Sea</HI> and <HI>dry Land,</HI> and the Earth bringing forth <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Grass</HI> and <HI>Trees,</HI> with all their wondrous <HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Fruits,</HI> while as yet there was no <HI>Ray</HI> of the Sun upon them; not knowing, but expecting greatly, for what kind of <HI>Creature</HI> and Creatures this vast Profusion of <HI>Bounty</HI> was prepared. They were the only <HI>Audience</HI> when God bad the <HI>Waters</HI> bring forth the <HI>moving</HI> Creature that hath <HI>Life,</HI> and the <HI>Fowl</HI> that fill the <HI>Air</HI> and fly in the open Firmament; and while they heard God <HI>bless</HI> his inferior living Creatures, and bid 'em to increase, to <HI>multiply</HI> and propagate their <HI>Kind,</HI> (a Thing altogether <HI>new</HI> to <HI>Angels</HI> and marvellous in their Eyes, for living Creatures to <HI>communicate</HI> Likeness and Life, under
<PB N="v" REF="004001_0008_100373B5B62ED1B0"/>the Power and Blessing of God) how were they fill'd with <HI>new</HI> Wonder and Delight at this <HI>new Thing</HI> which the <HI>Lord God</HI> created: whereof their Superiour World had given them no <HI>Idea.</HI> They then turn'd their Eyes on the <HI>dry Land,</HI> and with a growing Surprize saw <HI>the Cattle and creeping Things and Beasts</HI> come forth out of the <HI>Earth</HI> after their Kind; all of them finding their proper <HI>Food</HI> pro∣vided for them, and all of them made in <HI>Pairs</HI> to propagate their kind! a <HI>Scene</HI> of Beauty and Wonder, and superior Workmanship, suted to the Element of <HI>Air,</HI> as the <HI>Fishes</HI> before were to the Wa∣ters! and could the <HI>bright Intelligences</HI> above look down on all these Things, from Day to Day, as God created them, and not be <HI>ravish'd</HI> in the Contempla∣tion of them?</P>
<P>But most of all, when God proceeded and said, <Q><HI>Let Us make</HI> MAN, <HI>in our Image, after our Like∣ness, Male and Female; to have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattel and all the Earth;</HI></Q> how did the <HI>Hosts of Hea∣ven</HI> look (think we) with <HI>all</HI> their Eyes, to see what <HI>God-like</HI> Creature, like <HI>Themselves,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> of all this Earth and of all the Creatures on it, was com∣ing into Being? When presently they saw the <HI>Lord God</HI> form Man's <HI>Body</HI> of the Dust of the Ground, and then breathe into his Nostrils the <HI>Breath of Life,</HI> and he became a <HI>living Soul,</HI> a <HI>Spirit</HI> like Themselves, but united to Flesh and Blood! O new and won∣drous <HI>Form!</HI> so near <HI>a Kin</HI> unto themselves and yet how <HI>different!</HI> made <HI>male and female</HI> also, to <HI>multiply and fill the Earth,</HI> and eat all the Good of it! How did the Angels of God look on and love the happy <HI>perfect Pair,</HI> and more admire 'em, than <HI>they</HI> were able to admire the Wisdom and Power of God in themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="004001_0009_100373BE9609AD88"/>
I no more doubt, my <HI>Readers,</HI> of the Truth of something <HI>like</HI> these things that I here write, than I do of almost any thing <HI>not seen</HI> and not revealed to me in the Word of God. That is to say, I do not at all question but that in the Creation of this World of ours, the <HI>Angelic Hosts look'd on admiring and giving Glory to God,</HI> as the Almighty proceeded from one Part of his Work unto another; and that the Words of God to <HI>Job</HI> out of the <HI>Whirlwind</HI> are to be taken literally; <HI>"When the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for Joy.</HI></P>
<P>But Man in his <HI>fallen State,</HI> and in his <HI>Redemption</HI> has been more an Object of the <HI>Admiration</HI> of the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, than he was in his <HI>Creation.</HI> God's Work of <HI>Grace</HI> toward <HI>Sinners</HI> is represented to us as more admirable in the Eyes of <HI>Angels,</HI> than all his Works of Nature and Providence, in a separate Consideration herefrom. Not that Man's <HI>Sin</HI> was a thing so <HI>new</HI> to them, for they had seen their Fellow-Angels <HI>fall from Heaven;</HI> but the Recovery and <HI>Salvation</HI> of Sinners was a thing altogether <HI>unknown</HI> before. We find 'em therefore <HI>pictur'd</HI> by the Pen∣cil of God, and <HI>spoken</HI> of in his Word, as <HI>intently</HI> and for <HI>ever</HI> looking into this <HI>Mystery</HI> of Grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 17. 1 Pet. i. 12. Ephes iii. 10. Isai. vi. 2. Luke ii. 14. Revel. v. ii.</NOTE>. So the <HI>Cherubims</HI> were made, by the Order of God to <HI>Moses,</HI> with <HI>their Faces bowed over the Mercy-Seat,</HI> as never able to satisfy their pleasing Wonder on the <HI>sacred Mystery.</HI> And St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, that <HI>these Things the Angels desire to look into.</HI> For as another <HI>Apostle</HI> teaches us, <HI>By the Church</HI> on Earth is the <HI>manifold Wisdom of God made known to the Principalities and Powers above.</HI> And we have their <HI>new Songs</HI> thro' the Book of God, in Admiration of his Power,
<PB N="vii" REF="004001_0010_100373C9230D4828"/>Wisdom, Holiness and Mercy in the <HI>Redemption</HI> and Salvation of fallen Man.</P>
<P>Only let us never think that the <HI>Admiration of perfected Spirits</HI> ever grows into any <HI>like Surprises and Amazements,</HI> as are sometimes felt by us. The Light which shines in and on them in so pure clear and distinct, the Manner wherein they think and perceive is so perfect, the Government of their Tho't &amp; Affection is so true and exact, that it for∣bids us to imagine any such Weakness and Infirmity in their Admiration, as we find in our own. Inno∣cent &amp; holy Minds have a Strength, Steddiness and Fortitude of Tho't, which we have lost by our Fall. God of his Fulness communicates so to them, as is ever filling, refreshing and satisfying 'em. <HI>In his Light they see Light.</HI> The Glory of <HI>his Face</HI> is ever shining on them in all that they behold. They are able to make an equal and just Observation of all things. They see and search deep, with great Ease, into all Things, greater and less; and marvellous things occur to them in every one. They live in the World of Wonders, and see into the Wonders of all Worlds, see nothing little or common in any of them. All is great and good in their Eyes that God has done. We have <HI>Songs</HI> prepared for <HI>us</HI> which <HI>They</HI> take up and Sing: <Q><HI>The Works of the Lord are great, sought out by all them that have pleasure in them!</HI></Q> <Q><HI>If I would speak of them they are more than can be number'd.</HI></Q> Such Language as this becomes the Mouth of <HI>innocent</HI> Creatures, as well as <HI>ours.</HI> So He may be <HI>praised from the Heavens, "praised in the Heights!</HI> praise ye <HI>Him all his An∣gels!</HI> And were the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Stars</HI> shining Intelli∣gences like them, we should call on them to praise him in their Courses, and Stations: Or had the <HI>Deeps</HI> and <HI>Dragons</HI> from the Earth <HI>Minds</HI> to ad∣mire Him, and <HI>Tongues</HI> to extol Him, we might call on them to joyn with us in the Work. But since
<PB N="viii" REF="004001_0011_100373D3AAB92628"/><HI>Beasts and all Cattel, creeping Things and flying Fowl,</HI> have no such Powers for Praise; let <HI>Kings of the Earth and all People, Princes and all Judges, young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children, praise the Name of the Lord; for his Name alone is excellent; his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The great End and Design of this Affection of <HI>Admiration</HI> (says our admirable Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>) is to fix our <HI>Attention</HI> on the admired Object, to impress it more effectually on our <HI>Memory,</HI> and to give a sensible <HI>Delight</HI> to our Mind.</Q> How good, how pleasant and necessary then is it, to use this <HI>Means</HI> of fixing our Hearts on <HI>God</HI> by his Works, which day and night declare his <HI>Glory,</HI> and speak to us of his Eternal Power and <HI>Godhead.</HI></P>
<P>In short, Without the <HI>Admiration</HI> of God in his Works of Nature, Providence and Grace, there neither is nor can be any thing of <HI>Religion,</HI> either among Angels or Men. And there is so little Re∣ligion among Men on Earth, because there is no more Admiration of the blessed God in the Things that are seen, or that are revealed to us by him. The more God is admired by us the better He will be worshiped and served by us. It is because He is so perfectly admir'd by the Spirits in Glory, that he is so perfectly serv'd and obey'd by them. The Admiration of God works by Love to Him, Delight in him, Desire to please and glorify him, Fear and Reverence of his excellent Majesty, and the Hope of seeing and serving him for ever. It draws all the Affections of the Soul after it, carries them along with it, and is the Spring and Life of all Devotion. It enlarges the Mind and dilates the Heart, and leads it away a willing Captive. It opens the Lips to shew forth God's Praise, it lists up the Eyes and Hands to him, with Transports
<PB N="ix" REF="004001_0012_100373DC9749CAC0"/>of Joy: And at times too it stops the Voice, and <Q>strikes us mute, and Praise sits silent on the Tongue.</Q> — Such an Instrument of Devotion, and Handmaid to it, is true Admiration. It is sacred and devoted to God, and Man in his Inno∣cence kept it so. It is not only consistent with perfect Tranquility and Happiness, but indeed pro∣motes and advances it. There can be no true State or Relish of real Happiness in created Spi∣rits, without the free and full Exercise of this Affection. If there were nothing to be admir'd in <HI>God and Christ,</HI> in Heaven and Glory, how should they be the <HI>Beatific Objects</HI> to us?</P>
<P>I shall add but <HI>two</HI> Words more. The <HI>first</HI> is that the <HI>greatest Admiration</HI> seems to be with the <HI>least Surprize.</HI> Nothing is more calm and <HI>tranquil,</HI> I conceive, than the Admirations of Angels and perfected Spirits, in their Vision and Adoration of God. Our <HI>Surprises</HI> at things new and rare and unexpected is from the Weakness of Flesh and Blood, and from the Darkness of our Minds. The more feeble the more Surprize, but the stronger the Intellect is the more serene and placid, even and fix'd is the Admiration. — I know not which was <HI>Eve</HI>'s Fault and the Beginning of her Sin, whether too <HI>much</HI> Surprise at the <HI>Serpent</HI>'s speak∣ing to her, or too <HI>little</HI> Emotion at it. One or other might be the Beginning of her Fall. It was a wonderful Thing that a Snake or Worm should find a Tongue and Voice to speak to her. His cursed Motion to her, to eat of the forbidden Fruit, should have rais'd in her a holy <HI>Indig∣nation.</HI> Her Innocence and Holiness should have so express'd it self, when she heard God contra∣dicted, and mean and ill Things suggested of Him. But the <HI>Marvel</HI> at the Thing, and her Admiration
<PB N="x" REF="004001_0013_100373E8A55E1210"/>at the <HI>Serpent,</HI> seems to have taken up her Mind and drawn her away into a Parley and Talk with him. She was too curious to hear him out (speak∣ing after our manner) in all he had to say, and so was beguiled thro' his Subtlety. As the <HI>Snake</HI> to this day charms Birds and Squirrels with its Eye, so <HI>Eve</HI> seems to have been taken with the <HI>Admira∣ble</HI> in the Serpent's Management. She should have dropt the Wonder from a Detestation of his Words, and have answered only as her <HI>Blessed Seed</HI> did when he was tempted, "<HI>Get thee hence, Devil!</HI> Were it an <HI>Angel from Heaven</HI> that should speak thus, <HI>let him be accursed.</HI> Her Wonder should have wro't thus, "<HI>Lord God!</HI> what cursed kind of <HI>Beast</HI> is this, that speaks indeed, but to slander Thee, and give Thee the Lie! — But <HI>Eve</HI> seems to have been <HI>too calm</HI> and unmov'd upon so strange an Event, and so vile a Motion.</P>
<P>The <HI>other</HI> thing I would therefore add is, That <HI>an innocent and holy Mind</HI> may be piously struck with Admiration at Things <HI>most evil and disagrea∣ble to it.</HI> The <HI>Angels that keep their first State</HI> were doubtless struck with sacred Astonishment at the Rebellion of their Fellows; and after they had sung for Joy at the Creation of <HI>Man,</HI> they were fill'd with a holy kind of Wonder Grief and An∣ger at his sudden Fall. <HI>God</HI> Himself spake to <HI>Adam</HI> of it after this Manner, "<HI>Who told you, you were naked! have you eaten of the Tree whereof I commanded you that you should not eat of it? Woman, what is this that thou hast done?</HI> And to affect the stupid Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and Daughters of <HI>Eve,</HI> for their Iniquities after the similitude of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Trans∣gression, God has spoken in his Word of our Sins as such, that the very <HI>Heavens</HI> (the heavenly <HI>Spirits</HI> who dwell in them) might even be <HI>surpris'd</HI> and
<PB N="xi" REF="004001_0014_100373F30F2A62A0"/><HI>amazed</HI> at them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. i. 2. Jerem. ii. 12.</NOTE> <Q><HI>Hear O Heavens, I have nou∣rished and bro't up Children, and they have rebelled against me! Be astonished O ye Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid! be ye very desolate saith the Lord.</HI></Q> If any thing has ever |caus'd any thing like Surprize and Astonishment in the serene and holy Minds of Angels, it has been and is the <HI>Sin</HI> and Wickedness of Men and Devils. But even in this Case, the <HI>Difference</HI> is unknown, and it may be inconceivable, between the <HI>Wonder</HI> of a holy Mind above, and that of a Saint on Earth. — It may be represented to us from <HI>St. John</HI>'s Wonder∣ment at seeing the <HI>great Whore,</HI> and the <HI>Angels Answer</HI> to him: Revel. xvii. 1,—7. —<HI>And</HI> <Q><HI>when I saw her I wonder'd with great Admiration! and the Angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the Mystery of the Woman and of the Beast, her seven Heads and ten Horns.</HI></Q> See how <HI>surpriz'd the holy Man was</HI> at this <HI>horrid Form,</HI> <Q><HI>the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth, a Woman drunken with the Blood of Saints and of the Martyrs of Jesus, sitting upon a scarlet colour'd Beast, full of Names of Blasphemy!</HI></Q> but see again <HI>how calm the blessed Angel</HI> was! he even reproves mildly the great Admiration of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> as being too much. Yet the Bloodiness and Filthi∣ness of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> is abominated in <HI>Hea∣ven much more</HI> than it is in the <HI>true Church</HI> on Earth: But it is seen there with <HI>less</HI> surprize. Indeed the <HI>Harlot</HI> is a Wonder and an Abomination both there and here.</P>
<P>I ask my <HI>Readers</HI> Pardon that I have so long de∣tained him with a kind of <HI>new Dissertation</HI> on the <HI>Admiration</HI> which may agree unto a State of <HI>Inno∣cence</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="004001_0015_100373FF19583478"/>and Perfection: But the plain <HI>Scope</HI> of it is to direct and fix our <HI>admiring Thoughts</HI> on the Blessed GOD and his Works, and on <HI>His Image in our Selves</HI> in a more especial Manner; as they would have been <HI>if we had kept our first State,</HI> and as they <HI>will be in Heaven</HI> for Evermore if we regain <HI>it</HI> and get thither; which is the <HI>only Aim</HI> of the present <HI>Meditations.</HI></P>

It is a Matter of great <HI>Importance</HI> to the Children of <HI>Men,</HI> and to be for ever kept by them in a reli∣gious Remembrance, that God made our <HI>First Pa∣rents,</HI> both <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> in <HI>His own Image, in the Image of God.</HI></P>
<P>He made them alike <HI>Humane Souls,</HI> which know no Difference of <HI>Sex</HI> when out of the Body, but are <HI>as the Angels;</HI> of <HI>Whom</HI> nothing higher or more <HI>glorious</HI> can be said in their Original blessed State, than that God made <HI>Them,</HI> as He did <HI>us,</HI> in his <HI>own Image.</HI> Man was made a <HI>little lower</HI> than the Angels, but like them <HI>crowned</HI> with this <HI>Glory and Honour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm viii. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> is <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female. Neither is the Man with∣out the Woman, nor the Woman without the Man in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 7, 11, 12.</NOTE>: That is to say, neither in the Day of his <HI>Creation,</HI> nor in those of his <HI>Propagation</HI> thro' all past and future Generations: As it follows, <HI>For as the Woman is of the Man, even so is the Man also by the Woman; but all things of God.</HI> When therefore it is added, that <HI>the Man is the Image and Glory of God, but the Woman is the Glory of the Man,</HI> the <HI>Apostle</HI> explains himself only to give the <HI>Man</HI> his Preheminence in point of <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Dominion:</HI> This <HI>one Thing</HI> in the Image of God excepted, the Woman <HI>equally</HI> shines in the Glory of all the rest.</P>
<P>So are <HI>Mankind</HI> constituted &amp; propagated. <HI>Adam</HI> was first created, and then <HI>Eve;</HI> he out of the <HI>Dust</HI> of the Ground, and she taken out of his <HI>Body.</HI> So she became <HI>Bone of his Bone, and Flesh of his Flesh.</HI> But their <HI>equal</HI> and greater Glory was, that God made them alike <HI>living Souls,</HI> immortal <HI>Spirits,</HI> in a Perfection of <HI>Knowledge, Holiness</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> and consequently of <HI>Happiness</HI> and Blessedness, suted to their <HI>Earthly</HI> State, with <HI>Dominion</HI> over the Crea∣tures. <HI>Moses</HI> gives us <HI>this</HI> Account of <HI>the Image of
<PB N="3" REF="004001_0018_1003741F38B3D6B0"/>God</HI> wherein Man was created, if you compare, <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 26, 28. with <HI>Chap.</HI> ii. v. 7.15, 16, 17, 20, 23. And keeping my Eye upon <HI>this pure Word of God,</HI> it appears plain and evident that <HI>the Image of God on Man,</HI> in the Day when God created Him, <HI>con∣sisted</HI> in the following Things.</P>
<P N="1">I. GOD made Man a <HI>Spirit,</HI> a <HI>living Soul,</HI> and this was his <HI>Likeness</HI> to his MAKER, the <HI>Image</HI> of God upon him.</P>
<P>If you ask, what God is? <HI>Christ</HI> has revealed Him, John iv. 24. <HI>God is a Spirit.</HI> And if you ask, what <HI>Man</HI> is, <HI>Moses</HI> tells us, He is a <HI>living Soul.</HI> In his <HI>Soul</HI> he bears the <HI>Image of God,</HI> and not in his <HI>Body.</HI> His <HI>Body</HI> is of the <HI>Dust</HI> and returns to it, when his <HI>Spirit</HI> returns to <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Infinite Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Father of Spirits,</HI> the Lord, Ruler and Judge of <HI>Spirits,</HI> the only Portion and Felicity of <HI>Souls.</HI></P>
<P>God claims the <HI>Soul</HI> for his own, even <HI>all Souls,</HI> the Soul of the <HI>Father</HI> and of the <HI>Son</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii. 4.</NOTE>. This un∣seen Part of Man bears the Image of the <HI>Invisible</HI> and Incorruptible God. Were the <HI>Body</HI> a thousand times more elegant and <HI>wonderful a Form</HI> than it is, or even as it will be after the Resurrection, yet it were utterly impossible and <HI>unlawful</HI> to conceive of it as any Likeness of God. As when God would be seen in the <HI>Mount</HI> by the Elders of <HI>Israel,</HI> they saw <HI>no manner of Similitude</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. iv. 12.</NOTE>. The Face and Eye and Hands of Men are full of <HI>Spirit</HI> and Life, from the <HI>living Spirit</HI> within that animates and acts 'em. These are attributed to <HI>God</HI> in Scripture in way of Accommodation to <HI>Souls</HI> here in the Body. But the <HI>first</HI> thing in the Image of God on Angels and Men is <HI>Spirituality.</HI> What should be the Likeness of the <HI>Living God,</HI> but a <HI>living Soul</HI> or <HI>Spirit?</HI></P>

Indeed we little know what our <HI>Souls</HI> are: Yet we are sure that we are <HI>such,</HI> because we think, reason, remember, reflect, foresee, hope, fear, &amp;c. What the <HI>Spirituality</HI> of God is, is far more incon∣ceivable to us. He is <HI>Infinite,</HI> filling Heaven and Earth. <HI>Whither can we go from His Presence and Spirit</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxxix. Prov. xvi. 2.</NOTE>? The <HI>Rays</HI> of Light, <HI>the Wings of the Morning</HI> are not equal to the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of Men, for Brightness and Swiftness. In one <HI>Moment</HI> of Tho't my poor Mind reaches the <HI>third Heaven,</HI> a million times beyond the <HI>Sun</HI> in its <HI>Zenith.</HI> This Soul is a poor, low feeble Image of the Immensity, Spiritua∣lity and Omniscience of God. HE <HI>searches</HI> the Heart of Man, <HI>weighs</HI> his Spirit, and knows his Tho't <HI>affar off.</HI> This is <HI>too wonderful for us, it is high and we cannot attain to it.</HI></P>
<P>Let our Souls pause and imagine what an In∣comprehensible Spirit GOD is! <HI>What is his Name, and his Sons Name, if thou canst tell</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 4</NOTE>. HE <HI>is that He is, has Life in Himself,</HI> and <HI>in Him we live and move and have our Being</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. iii. 14. John v. 26. Acts. xvii. 25.28.</NOTE>. The Worlds of <HI>Spirits,</HI> and so the <HI>Corporeal Universe,</HI> are his Workman∣ship, <Q>continually sustained and governed by Him. His active Essence therefore intimately pervades and penetrates the immeasurable Frame! GOD is Life, Light, Mind, Self-existence; Glory, Blessedness, Perfection; incomparable, inconcei∣vable. <HI>To Whom can we liken Him, or what Likeness can we compare unto Him?</HI> Singularity and Onliness is his Glory. <HI>There is One God, and no other than He.</HI></Q><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Religion of <HI>Iesus</HI> delineated.</NOTE></P>
<P>We should not have dar'd to say of God that He is <HI>a Spirit,</HI> or to have call'd Spirits his <HI>Image and Likeness,</HI> if He Himself had not so spoken to us of
<PB N="5" REF="004001_0020_10037430263C3158"/>Himself. Yet is there no other Image whereby our <HI>Minds</HI> can represent Him to themselves, but from their own spiritual Nature, Powers, and Operations. This therefore must be the <HI>first</HI> thing in the Image of God of Angels and Men, <HI>Spirituality.</HI> In this Glass we see the first <HI>Shadow</HI> of God. Our Souls discern it by <HI>Reflection</HI> on themselves. We then look <HI>without,</HI> look abroad, and see thro' the Eyes of the Body Images of Wisdom, Power and Goodness, in every thing Material and Visible. We see the Work of some perfectly wise, good, Almighty <HI>In∣telligence.</HI> — It is in and from <HI>it self,</HI> that the poor finite <HI>Spirit of Man,</HI> conscious to its own Understand∣ing and Affections, and enlightned from the Spirit and Word of God, conceives and infers what a transcendent Being and <HI>Spirit</HI> God is; the Framer of the Universe, and the Former and Father of all Spirits. It is because we in our <HI>Souls</HI> bear some <HI>I∣mage</HI> of God, that we can at all apprehend &amp; know that God is a <HI>Spirit.</HI> The <HI>Beasts</HI> have Eyes to see the Fields of Grass and Corn as much as we, but not having <HI>our Souls</HI> to discern the <HI>Eternal Power and Godhead</HI> from the Things that are made, their Spirits are not the Likeness of God as ours are.</P>
<P>And yet the <HI>spiritual Nature</HI> of Angels and Men is not to be compared with the Spirituality of God, or the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of his Essence. The grossest <HI>Mat∣ter</HI> that our Eyes behold is not so much below the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man, as <HI>that</HI> is below the Spirituality of the <HI>Divine Nature.</HI> Never the less in the Faculties of the <HI>Humane Soul</HI> we plainly see some Resemblance of the <HI>Infinite Eternal Spirit,</HI> the Maker and Pre∣server of all Things, visible &amp; invisible. And this is the <HI>first</HI> and most obvious part of the Image of God upon us in our <HI>Creation,</HI> that we are Souls or Spirits. God who made us <HI>this Soul</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xxxviii. 16.</NOTE>, herein has
<PB N="6" REF="004001_0021_1003743AEB1D8190"/>made us <HI>in his own Image, after his Likeness;</HI> for He is THE SPIRIT, and <HI>the Father of Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>God is a <HI>Spirit</HI> in a Sense far superior to that wherein <HI>Angels</HI> are to be so called. <HI>He maketh his Angels Spirits</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm. civ. 4.</NOTE>. I doubt not but God is more In∣visible to them, and in Comparison of them, than they are to us and in Comparison of us. <HI>Created</HI> Spirits are <HI>compounded</HI> Beings if compared with their MAKER; they are <HI>made</HI> what they are, and He who made them can if he please annihilate and dis∣solve them again. But there is an ineffable, incon∣ceivable <HI>Simplicity of Essence</HI> in the Divine Nature, which infinitely distinguishes His Spirituality from that of all Creatures.— Angels and Souls are <HI>Spi∣rits</HI> but they singly occupy a space, and pass from place to place, with an incredible Swiftness, like <HI>Rays of Light;</HI> but the Invisible God is an <HI>Immense Being</HI> filling Heaven and Earth, always present and the same in all Places. This is as <HI>far</HI> above Souls or Angels, as they are above Bodies.</P>
<P>It is a most just and glorious Account that God gave of Himself to <HI>Moses,</HI> I AM THAT I AM. He is what no One else is or can be; He is <HI>alone</HI> what He is; what <HI>all</HI> his Creatures can but poorly re∣present, and less can understand; even as the <HI>Sha∣dow</HI> of a Man does but poorly represent him in his Life, Look, Thought and Speech. — God is <HI>singly</HI> the Spiritual BEING, and there is none <HI>like</HI> Him, none <HI>beside</HI> Him. As there is <HI>none Good but One which is God,</HI> so is there but <HI>One only Spirit</HI> in the Universe, <HI>who filleth all in all</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Lord</HI> our God is ONE LORD, and the Knowledge of HIM is <HI>too wonderful for us; it is high, and we cannot attain to it:</HI> yea how little do we know of <HI>our own Spirits,</HI> which are made for
<PB N="7" REF="004001_0022_100374456D004F38"/>the Knowledge of Him? It is but <HI>as thro' a Glass darkly</HI> that we see any thing of GOD. The Ideas of <HI>Infinite, Eternal, Unchangeable</HI> and <HI>Self∣existent</HI> are the Proof and Illustration of his <HI>Spiri∣tuality.</HI> We can only explain and confirm the One from the other. As <HI>what Man knoweth the Things of a Man, save the Spirit of Man that is in him? even so the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 11.</NOTE>: <HI>Which Things we</HI> therefore <HI>speak, not in the Words which Mans Wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual Things with spiritual.</HI></P>
<P>There is therefore unto me no Account of the <HI>Spirituality of God</HI> like unto the following <HI>Texts</HI> of Scripture. Exod. iii. <HI>I</HI> AM, <HI>that is my Name.</HI> xxxiii. 20. <HI>Thou canst not see my Face.</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 16. <HI>Whom no Man hath seen, nor can see.</HI> Heb. iv. 13. <HI>All things</HI> (even all Souls and Spirits) <HI>are naked and open before Him.</HI> Psalm. cxxxix. <HI>Thou understandest my Tho'ts afar off.</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 11. <HI>That One and Self same</HI> SPIRIT <HI>divideth to every one severally as He will.</HI> So does the <HI>One Immense Being</HI> in all Worlds, visible and invisible, to every Creature, superior and infe∣rior, as the one Creator, Preserver, Governour, Judge, Sanctifier and Saviour of <HI>all.</HI> — This is <HI>Light without any Darkness at all, Light unapprocha∣ble and full of Glory.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John. i. 5.</NOTE> There can be no more glo∣rious and convictive <HI>Light</HI> given us into the <HI>Spiri∣tuality</HI> of God than St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s noble Discourse to the Men of <HI>Athens,</HI> Acts. xvii. While the Eye reads it, the Soul <HI>sees and feels</HI> what a SPIRIT God is: it <HI>seeks</HI> and feels and <HI>finds</HI> Him within it self: "GOD <HI>that made the World and all things in it, Lord of Hea∣ven and Earth! who dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands, nor is worshiped by us as tho' he needeth

<P N="2">II. <HI>God</HI> made <HI>Man</HI> in his own <HI>Image</HI> in respect of <HI>Intellect and Understanding, Knowledge and Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>God is the <HI>Only-wise</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 27. Job xxxvi. 4., Psalm. cxlvii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>perfect in Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>his Understanding is infinite.</HI> So his <HI>Word</HI> speaks of Him, and his <HI>Works</HI> declare it of Him. <HI>He that formeth the Eye, shall He not see? and He that teach∣eth Man Knowledge shall He not know?</HI> There is not a Soul so <HI>brutish</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm. xciv. 10.</NOTE> as not to allow this.</P>
<P><HI>Man,</HI> in his Soul and Body is the most eminent Display of <HI>the Knowledge and Wisdom of God</HI> here on Earth. The Mind and Eye of Man survey the Hea∣vens, Earth, Seas and all the Creatures, and see how <HI>in Wisdom God hath made them all</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm. civ. 24.</NOTE>. Then we be∣hold <HI>our Selves</HI> alone, among all the Creatures here on Earth, capable of <HI>this Understanding,</HI> and are led to say unto our Selves and unto God, <HI>Where is God my Maker! that teacheth me more than the Beasts of the Earth, and maketh me wiser than the Fowl of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> in his <HI>first State</HI> was happy and glorious in a <HI>Perfection</HI> of Knowledge and Wisdom, proper for an imbodied Spirit. He had not the Knowledge of <HI>Angels,</HI> for he was made <HI>lower</HI> than they; but he was <HI>wise as an Angel</HI> in Flesh should be. He was created with a due Knowledge of <HI>God</HI> his Maker, of
<PB N="9" REF="004001_0024_1003745E179BF5E8"/><HI>Himself,</HI> and of the <HI>Creatures</HI> about him. God spake to our first Parents, and they to each other in an admirable manner, as is related by <HI>Moses.</HI> Their Minds were full of <HI>Light,</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of God was in their Heart, and they were in the <HI>Possession</HI> of their own Souls and of <HI>Intellectual Happiness.</HI> They want∣ed no more Knowledge of <HI>Good</HI> at the Time, and to be sure needed no Knowledge of <HI>Evil.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Understanding</HI> of Man was a Beam from the Light of the Knowledge and Glory of God upon him. God made him like Himself an <HI>Intellect,</HI> an <HI>Intelligence;</HI> the <HI>Inspiration of the Almighty</HI> gave him his Understanding. <HI>In</HI> his <HI>Light</HI> Man <HI>saw Light.</HI> And now Souls are <HI>renewed in Knowledge after the Image of God</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 10.</NOTE>. They are renewed into the Like∣ness, in part, wherein they were first created. As they grow in holy <HI>Knowledge,</HI> they are <HI>changed</HI> more and more into the <HI>Divine Image from Glory to Glory</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> tempted our Parents to aspire after <HI>more Knowledge,</HI> and so they fell. The <HI>Father of Light</HI> had given them as much of this <HI>perfect Gift</HI> as was good and fitting for them. This should have highly contented them, and filled 'em with Delight and Thankfulness. And so it did, until the false <HI>Fiend</HI> perswaded them to think, that GOD forbid 'em <HI>the Tree of Knowledge</HI> left it should make 'em wiser and better than they were. Alas! they found nothing by it but the Knowledge of <HI>Sin and Misery,</HI> of which it was their Happiness to be ignorant; and they <HI>lost</HI> the Knowledge of all the <HI>Good</HI> which they be∣fore enjoyed. We remain miserable, and perish in our Ignorance of God, unless we are renewed after Him in Knowledge. True spiritual <HI>Wisdom</HI> is re∣stored in the Regeneration of Souls. God gives the <HI>Light of the Knowledge of his Glory in the Face of</HI>

<P>That the <HI>Soul</HI> be without Knowlege, is not <HI>good.</HI> It is very <HI>evil</HI> to it to be so. What is a dark and <HI>blind</HI> Soul good for! <HI>the Light that is in it is Dark∣ness.</HI> The Light of Life is from <HI>the Father of Glory,</HI> the Father of <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Eyes of our Understanding being-enlightned, to know the Hope of his Calling.

<P>What a <HI>bright</HI> Account is this, given by the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> of the <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>God</HI> on the Soul of Man, in respect of <HI>Knowledge!</HI> Not only has Man an <HI>Un∣derstanding</HI> which reflects on its own Acquirements, and (as an excellent <HI>Divine</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> on the <HI>Catechism.</HI></NOTE> of our own says) "<HI>reads</HI> its own Knowledge, and <HI>communicates</HI> it to others; but the true and high Glory of this created <HI>Intellect</HI> is, "that it is capable of <HI>knowing God</HI> un∣to Eternal Life; <HI>for this is Life Eternal to know Him the only true God and Jesus Christ whom be has sent.</HI> And if Souls <HI>regenerated by the Spirit of God</HI> receive from him a <HI>sanctified Mind,</HI> a <HI>spiritual Dis∣cerning</HI> of Things relating to their own Duty and Happiness; how much more must we suppose our <HI>first Parents</HI> in their state of <HI>Integrity</HI> and Perfection to be bless'd with a most <HI>holy Knowledge</HI> and spiri∣tual Discerning?</P>
<P>But there is <HI>another</HI> of the <HI>Divine Attributes,</HI> which in the <HI>Scripture</HI> Account of it and in the enlightned <HI>Mind</HI> of Man, <HI>excels</HI> in Glory, and is yet more emi∣nently

<P>There is a <HI>moral</HI> as well as <HI>intellectual</HI> Perfection. The Blessedness of God and his Glory lies in <HI>both.</HI> HE is infinitely and unchangeably possess'd of both.

<P>Pause here a Moment and reflect, — It is in our <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Spirite</HI> that we must look for any <HI>Likeness</HI> or <HI>Image</HI> of God, most High most Wise and Holy! and it is <HI>essential</HI> to every created <HI>Spirit</HI> in its first Existence to be <HI>like</HI> God the Father of Spirits, as his <HI>Offspring,</HI> in Understanding and Will, in a <HI>Rectitude</HI> of both; Which is to say, in <HI>Integrity and Upright∣ness,</HI> in moral and intellectual Perfection <HI>together;</HI> for they are inseparable, are <HI>lost</HI> together and are <HI>recovered</HI> together: They come from Heaven, pre∣pare for Heaven, and are unchangeably and eter∣nally in Heaven — Let <HI>God</HI> be dear and honour∣ed to us, and our <HI>Souls</HI> be dear and prized by us, from the Consideration of what God at first made them; so <HI>wise</HI> and knowing, <HI>holy</HI> and righteous. God made them <HI>for</HI> Himself and <HI>like</HI> Himself; <HI>in</HI> his Image and <HI>for</HI> his Glory; and for <HI>their Blessed∣ness</HI> in his Likeness and Love for Evermore. <HI>This</HI> we ought to have <HI>preserved</HI> and been ever happy; now let us seek to <HI>recover</HI> it in the Way of Gospel Perfection, (by Regeneration, Repentance, holy O∣bedience, and by Faith in a better Righteousness than our own) setting the Life and Laws of Christ ever before us; and we shall become <HI>wise, holy and blessed,</HI> in a Measure of Conformity to <HI>Christ,</HI> who is <HI>the Image of the Invisible God, the First-born of every
<PB N="15" REF="004001_0030_1003748E74DB9DC0"/>Creature;</HI> which is the whole <HI>End,</HI> Aim and Fruit of the <HI>Ministry of the Gospel,</HI> of <HI>Sabbaths and Ordi∣nances,</HI> the <HI>Word, Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>In short, the most full and perfect Resemblance of <HI>created Spirits</HI> unto the <HI>One</HI> infinitely wise and good SPIRIT, theri Former and Father, can be <HI>no other,</HI> either more or less than <HI>this,</HI> — the Mind and Will of the <HI>Creature</HI> agreeing perfectly after his Mea∣sure and Manner, to the Wisdom and Rectitude of the CREATOR: So that the Soul at first received a <HI>Stamp</HI> and Impress of God, even as the Wax does of a <HI>Seal,</HI> as well in its <HI>Will</HI> and Affections as in its <HI>Intellectual</HI> Powers; even a gracious <HI>Habit,</HI> to pro∣pose cleave to and prosecute the highest and <HI>best End,</HI> in the most proper and direct <HI>Means:</HI> So that as <HI>God</HI> ever acts for his <HI>own Glory</HI> in his <HI>Creatures Happiness,</HI> so the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man in its Conformity to Him acts for the <HI>Glory of God</HI> and <HI>its own Blessedness</HI> in his Favour. This must be <HI>the first and great Com∣mandment</HI> of the Lord God to the Soul that he has made, and its <HI>last</HI> Happiness and <HI>Perfection,</HI> its <HI>Like∣ness</HI> to God and <HI>Union</HI> with him; "<HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all the Understanding and with all thy Heart.</HI> The Soul cannot <HI>close</HI> more with God, nor <HI>receive</HI> more of Him. — As will further ap∣pear by our going on to consider,</P>
<P N="4">IV. God created Man in his own <HI>Image,</HI> after his <HI>Likeness,</HI> in respect of <HI>Dominion.</HI> These are the express Words of <HI>Moses, "God said, Let Us make Man in Our Image, after Our Likeness, and let them have</HI> DOMINION.</P>
<P>God is LORD <HI>of all!</HI> this is his <HI>Glory</HI> and unalie∣nable <HI>Right,</HI> to reign and rule. He cannot deny Himself, and wo to his Creation should his Govern∣ment and Providence cease. His is the Power and Kingdom; He is GOD <HI>over all;</HI> the <HI>Most High, Pos∣sessor of Heaven and Earth.</HI> Heaven is his <HI>Throne,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="004001_0031_100358D8681598C0"/>and the Earth his <HI>Footstool.</HI> Angels, Authorities and Powers are all under his Feet. He is the One Law∣giver and Judge, the <HI>Lord of Hosts and King of Glory.</HI> Wisdom and Might are His: his Dominion is an Everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom from Gene∣ration to Generation.</P>
<P>Intellectual and moral Creatures carry an Image of God's <HI>Dominion</HI> in their Nature. They are made for Rule and Government in their Places. <HI>Angels</HI> are therefore called <HI>Dominions</HI> and <HI>Thrones, Princi∣palities</HI> and <HI>Powers.</HI> And <HI>Man</HI> was in like manner made for <HI>Government</HI> here on Earth. The <HI>Fear</HI> of him was put upon the Creatures, and they herein are put <HI>under his Feet.</HI> God first said to him, <HI>Have thou Dominion,</HI> and then bro't them to <HI>Adam</HI> to give them <HI>Names.</HI> So he gave him Possession of them all. This is celebrated in the <HI>Eighth Psalm;</HI> the Glory is given to God and all Pride is hidden from Man: "<HI>What is Man that Thou art mindful of him! Thou hast made him a little lower than the Angeis, and hast crowned him with Glory and Honour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> is made for <HI>Dominion</HI> in his Place as <HI>Angels</HI> are in their. Rational and moral <HI>Powers</HI> are given to be sure to be used and <HI>applied,</HI> to great and good <HI>Ends</HI> and Purposes, respecting <HI>God, Self,</HI> and <HI>Fel∣low Creatures,</HI> in one World or other. The Appli∣cation of these Powers must be in <HI>Subjection</HI> to God, the <HI>Government</HI> of our Selves, and a righteous <HI>Con∣duct</HI> toward others, below or above us, or on a Le∣vel with us.</P>
<P>But principally Man's <HI>Glory</HI> is, that he is made for <HI>Self-Government,</HI> for Rule over himself, for <HI>a Possession of his own Soul,</HI> the Government of his own <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Will, Desires</HI> and <HI>Appetites, Thot's, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This</HI> was the Dominion he was principally design∣ed for, and invested with. The <HI>Law</HI> of his God put <HI>within</HI> him, and given to him in <HI>Words</HI> as soon
<PB N="17" REF="004001_0032_1003749473285040"/>as he found himself in Being, sufficiently told him this. It spake indeed plainly his <HI>Subjection to-God,</HI> that he was made for <HI>Obedience</HI> and a reasonable Service; But it spake also his <HI>Preheminence</HI> above the Creatures put under him, in a distinguishing Power for the <HI>Rule</HI> of his own Actions, with Un∣derstanding and Choice, Liberty and Freedom, and from a Conscience of right and wrong.</P>
<P>Understanding and Wisdom, the Power of Tho't and Consideration was given to Man <HI>for this End. "The Lord God put the Man into the Garden to dress and keep it, and He commanded the Man, saying</HI> &amp;c. Thus Man was made <HI>under the Law to God,</HI> a Law to himself, and was both able and inclined to do the Will of God, and to govern himself thereby. And this Power for <HI>Self-Government,</HI> by the Light and Law of God within him, and by the Will of God revealed to him, was the <HI>Image</HI> of his God upon him.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Divine Dominion</HI> and Government is in the Perfection of Wisdom and Righteousness. <HI>The Sceptre of his Kingdom is a right Sceptre.</HI> He does according to <HI>his Will</HI> in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; but his Will is <HI>perfect,</HI> his <HI>Ways are Truth and Judgment,</HI> He is <HI>holy in all his Work, just and right is He.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Subjection</HI> of Man to <HI>God</HI> is his <HI>go∣verning Himself,</HI> in all his Thot's Words &amp; Actions, in a wise, righteous and superiour manner; as be∣comes a Creature in the <HI>Likeness of God,</HI> and made for Authority and Rule on Earth.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Lord</HI> therefore tells us that he came into our World to recover Man into his Original Freedom and Liberty. "<HI>If the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John viii. 36. Rom. viii. 21. Luke xvii. 21.</NOTE>. Man by his Fall <HI>lost</HI> that Domi∣nion
<PB N="18" REF="004001_0033_1003749AA708F738"/>over, and Possession of himself, wherein God had made him. The Son of God came to <HI>restore him into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.</HI> The <HI>Image</HI> of the Heavenly Father is restored in those Souls, whom his Grace recovers from the Bondage of Sin and Satan, into his own Kingdom, which <HI>Kingdom of God is within us.</HI> It makes Men <HI>Kings and Priests to God.</HI> They use Themselves, and all his Creatures, to the Creator's <HI>Glory.</HI> This was that <HI>Original Dominion</HI> in which and for which Man was made. His Original <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> was given Him for <HI>this</HI> End. So God <HI>qualified</HI> him for the <HI>Rule</HI> to which he called him. He gives no <HI>Right</HI> but for <HI>his own Glory</HI> from his Creatures, and for <HI>their Happiness</HI> in a regular ordering and conducting themselves.— And this leads me to another Point, wherein the <HI>Image of God</HI> consisted in Man's Original Stace of Knowledge Holiness &amp; Dominion, and that is</P>
<P N="5">V. His Original State of <HI>Happiness and Blessedness.</HI> —God is the <HI>blessed Being;</HI> infinitely, eternally and unchangeably <HI>happy;</HI> being possess'd of all possible Perfection and Glory for ever and ever: "<HI>God over all, blessed for Evermore</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm. cxix. 12. Rom. ix. 5.</NOTE>. He made <HI>Man</HI> happy, and for Happiness everlasting: He forbad him that which he knew would make him miserable: For he knew that <HI>Misery</HI> must lie in the <HI>Loss</HI> of the Divine Likeness.</P>
<P>A <HI>miserable</HI> Creature could not come out of the Hand of the <HI>blessed</HI> God: He could not make a liv∣ing Soul so <HI>unlike</HI> Himself, so <HI>contrary</HI> to Himself. —The Creature must make it self miserable, if ever if become so. Angels and Men have made them∣selves so, against the Commandment of God, by their own Sin and Transgression. They have wick∣edly
<PB N="19" REF="004001_0034_100358DCF56C21D8"/>chosen Evil under the Notion of Good, and thereby brought Misery upon themselves. But God required 'em to chuse only what is good, and to re∣fuse the Evil. God made 'em in the Knowledge of Good, and ignorant of Evil.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> was made innocent, wise and holy, and therefore necessarily <HI>happy.</HI> He was made blessed for ever, in case he did not commit <HI>Sin,</HI> from which Misery naturally flows, and with which it is neces∣sarily connected.—<HI>Man</HI> was made happy both as to Soul and Body: He wanted nothing for either. He had Wisdom and Purity within, Peace &amp; Joy, Content and Pleasure. Without him he had a Pa∣radise, a Garden of God. Every thing grew there, pleasant to the Eye, to the Smell and to the Taste. His Eye beheld a Creation of God's in Perfection. He had a charming Tongue and Voice to praise Him. The musical <HI>Birds,</HI> happy in the <HI>Branches,</HI> singing and feasting there, were but an Emblem of their Owners Liberty and Freedom to what was good and joyous. Man was a thousand fold more a Pleasure to himself in all his Tho'ts and Words! in his Contemplations of God in his Works, in his Knowledge of his Will, in his Sense of the Divine Favours and Bounties to him, in a Heart full of Gratitude to God, and with a Tongue tuned to his Praise, to magnify Him with Thanksgivings.</P>
<P>Every intellectual and moral Pleasure attended Man in his Paradisaic State, as well as every sensi∣tive Delight. "He feasted (says One) on the Loving-kindness of God, better than Life, and on all the Sweets of an untarnished Creation.— God <HI>blessed</HI> him in the Day he made him, for he saw him in a blessed State, and required him to keep himself in that State and be happy. God bound himself to bless him, if he kept himself in his Love. As a Means of preserving himself herein, God gave him his <HI>Sabbath</HI> and his <HI>Covenant:</HI> He blessed every
<PB N="20" REF="004001_0035_100374A418E73A98"/><HI>Seventh Day</HI> to him, for a Time of special Commu∣nications of his Grace and Love; and none of us can imagine what a <HI>blessed Day</HI> every <HI>Seventh</HI> would have been to Man in his State of Innocence &amp; Ho∣liness; what Visits and Visions from Heaven Man had enjoy'd thereon. It may be a <HI>Flavel,</HI> or an <HI>Henry</HI> the Elder, may sometimes have tasted a lit∣tle of like Rapture.</P>
<P>Real and sensible <HI>Communion with God</HI> is the pro∣per Blessedness of Souls. A measure of it remains to fallen recovered Man in his secret and publick Devotions. <HI>Because thy Loving kindness is better than Life my Lips shall praise thee: Thus will I bless thee while I live, I will lift up my Hands in thy Name: My Soul shall be satisfied as with Marrow and Fatness, and my Mouth shall praise thee with joyful Lips: My Soul followeth bard after thee, thy right Hand uphold∣eth me</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxiii. 3, 4, 5. Heb iv. 3.</NOTE>. Believers in Christ <HI>do enter into this Rest,</HI> but it comes vastly short of a Sabbath <HI>in Eden,</HI> or the <HI>Heavenly Sabbatisin.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt but the Image of God was <HI>visible</HI> upon Man in his Earthly Paradise, and <HI>sensible</HI> to himself in his inward Frame. His <HI>Mind</HI> was full of Light, his Heart of Joy; which beam'd out in his Eyes and <HI>Face,</HI> and flow'd over from his <HI>Mouth</HI> and Tongue. The Abundance within <HI>irradiated</HI> the whole Body. If <HI>Moses</HI> Face shone in the Mount with God, how did <HI>Adam</HI>'s in the Garden of God! The <HI>Ioy of the Lord</HI> was a Covering of Glory on Him: It fell off in the Hour he sinned, and he saw himself <HI>naked.</HI> Our <HI>Parents</HI> look'd astonied at one another to see the outward Change upon themselves, as well as from what they felt within. They ran to the <HI>Fig-Leaves</HI> to hide their Shame.</P>
<P>Thus Man <HI>lost</HI> the Image of God in the sensible Loss of his Happiness. <HI>Misery is the Image of Satan.</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="004001_0036_100358DFD0B8CAD0"/>Such is Guilt to a Soul: Pollution attends it: Grief and Shame are the inevitable Consequent. The E∣vils of the World, with <HI>Death</HI> in the Rear of the woful Train, shows us the Loss of the <HI>Divine Like∣ness</HI> wherein we were created. For we were made for <HI>immortal Life</HI> and Happiness, and lo Misery and <HI>Death</HI> have invaded us! Which leads me to add,</P>
<P N="6">VI. And lastly, God created Man <HI>in His own Image</HI> in respect of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Immortality.</HI> God made <HI>Adam</HI> a <HI>living Soul</HI> that can <HI>never die,</HI> a natural I∣mage of HIM <HI>who only hath Immortality.</HI> And God covenanted with <HI>Adam</HI> that tho' his Body was cor∣ruptible in it self, yet He would preserve it in Health, Ease and Strength, and it should never see Death in case he never sinned. God gave him therefore the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> to eat of, a Sign Pledge and Means of Immortality to his Body, and of the Continuance of Happiness to him in Soul and Body all his Days on Earth; and I doubt not it was also a Seal and Assurance to him of a Translation to a better World, a better Paradise in due Time.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> could not but <HI>begin</HI> to be because he was a Creature; no more could the <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven. <HI>God</HI> only is <HI>Eternal,</HI> from Everlasting to Everlasting, without Beginning or End. <HI>Spirits</HI> that can never cease to be, yet once were not. By God were the Invisible Thrones and Dominions above created, and so likewise the Spirits in Flesh. Both were made for an <HI>everlasting</HI> Existence and Duration. The Word of God's Power <HI>upholds</HI> them in Being, whe∣ther in a holy and happy State, or in their sinful and miserable Condition. This <HI>Immortality</HI> simply considered is a signal Likeness of the <HI>Everlasting Father</HI> upon his <HI>Offspring. Angels</HI> are in this Image of God upon them for ever and ever: Their Be∣ing, Glory, Blessedness, Joys are sure of an everlast∣ing Duration. And <HI>Souls</HI> that are here <HI>sanctified in

<P>Indeed there is no Image of God's <HI>Self-Existence,</HI> his necessary Existence, his Independent Essence, his proper <HI>Eternity</HI> and Unchangeableness, in the im∣mortal Nature of Angels or Men, or in the happy Immortality of holy Spirits. God is <HI>the High and lofty</HI> ONE <HI>that inhabiteth Eternity;</HI> having <HI>Life in Himself.</HI> Only the Eternal <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> who are <HI>One</HI> with the <HI>Father,</HI> are also the <HI>Brightness</HI> and <HI>express Image</HI> of his <HI>Eternal Glory.</HI> Yet every <HI>immor∣tal</HI> Spirit is an Image of the <HI>Vital Being</HI> from Whom it came; in Whom alone is the <HI>Origine</HI> of Life, and <HI>the Life</HI> is the <HI>Light</HI> of Men and Angels: i. e. the <HI>Living God</HI> is the Spring and <HI>Fountain</HI> of it; as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> sings, "<HI>For with Thee is the Fountain of Life</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxvi. 9.

<P>And thus we have said something (O how little a part) of the <HI>blessed Image of God</HI> wherein Man was created: A little <HI>lower than the Angels,</HI> but like

<ITEM>1. To <HI>contemplate</HI> and delight <HI>Himself</HI> in Man, as in a Glass or <HI>Effigy:</HI> As we read Prov. viii. 31. that in the Day <HI>when He appointed the Foundations of the Earth his Ioy was in the habitable Parts of it, and his Delights in the Sons of Men.</HI></ITEM>

This must necessarily be the <HI>first and great, Commandment</HI> and indispensable, <HI>Duty</HI> of all Creatures, in all Worlds, made in the <HI>Image</HI> of God. For they are made to <HI>love</HI> what is good and lovely; and the <HI>Original</HI> of Good, the Perfection of Beauty, to be sure <HI>first;</HI> the most perfect and <HI>supreme</HI> Good with the <HI>highest</HI> Affection.

If <HI>God</HI> then be a <HI>Father</HI> (and <HI>have we not One Father? has not one God created us?</HI>) this must be the <HI>Honour</HI> due from us; and <HI>our</HI> great Honour it is to be per∣mitted to <HI>love</HI> the Greatest and Best of <HI>Beings,</HI> for <HI>this</HI> Reason, because He has made us <HI>in his own Likeness?</HI> No wonder this is his <HI>Law</HI> to us, and this his Grace and <HI>Favour</HI> to us, to require our <HI>Love?

<P><Q>Did ever any <HI>Prince</HI> make a Law that his <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> should love Him<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> on Deut. vi.</NOTE>? yet such is the Conde∣scention

<P>Let me turn the <HI>Question,</HI> and ask — Was there ever any <HI>King</HI> that did not expect and require the Love of his <HI>own Children?</HI> So high and near a Sub∣ject as a <HI>Child</HI> must needs love, as well as fear; and it is the Glory of Kings to be lov'd as well as fear'd.</P>
<P>But if we are made in God's <HI>Image,</HI> let our <HI>Love</HI> be regulated hereby. <Q>Our Desire must be toward Him, out Delight in him, our Dependance on him, and to him we must be intirely devoted. It must be a comstant Pleasure to us to think of Him, hear from him, speak to him and serve him. We must love him with an intelligent, in∣tire and superlative Affection.</Q> <HI>We have had Fa∣thers of our Flesh and we gave them Reverence; shall we not</HI> love <HI>the Father of our Spirits and live?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Our being made in the <HI>Image of God</HI> teaches us to <HI>love our Selves,</HI> to love <HI>our own Souls,</HI> with a high <HI>Esteem</HI> and Value, with a rational <HI>tender and fervent</HI> Affection. God made us to love our Selves for <HI>his sake,</HI> for his Image on us and Glory from us. God is Himself <HI>Love</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John. iv. 8.</NOTE>: What more <HI>amiable Idea</HI> can we have of Him? what a <HI>delectable Object</HI> is He by this Account of Him? How <HI>lovely</HI> is He to Himself and to all Intelligent Beings! He is in the first place <HI>Love</HI> with Regard to <HI>Himself,</HI> in a most perfect blessed everlasting <HI>Self-love.</HI> He necessarily, infinitely and unchangeably loves <HI>Himself;</HI> whether we consider Him in the <HI>Ineffable</HI> mutual Love of <HI>Three Divine Persons, One in God-head and Glory;</HI> or in his infinite <HI>Complacence</HI> in his own <HI>blessed and glo∣rious Perfections.</HI> He has revealed Himself thus to us, "<HI>I the Lord thy God am a jealous God!</HI> which speaks <HI>Self-Regard</HI> in the highest Degree. He can∣not

<P>It is evident that <HI>the Principle of true Self-love</HI> in us is Part of the <HI>Image on God</HI> on us; for by <HI>this</HI> we govern our Selves, our Appetites, our Will and Affections, by the Will of God, for his Glory and our own Good, present and future. As soon as <HI>Adam</HI> was created he was forbidden <HI>to Sin against his own Life;</HI> "In the Day thou eatest thou shalt surely <HI>die.</HI>" In our fallen State God addresses to this same Principle, in its Remains within us, "<HI>Why will ye die?</HI> In Regeneration Souls are recover'd to <HI>the true Love of Themselves.</HI> As <HI>God</HI> is glorious Self-love, so is <HI>Man</HI> in his | primitive and saved State. The greatest <HI>Self-good</HI> we can propose to our Selves, is to be <HI>like God,</HI> and to have him well pleased with us. That is to say, <HI>to be good and do good,</HI> as God is and does.</P>
<P>We should love nothing in our Selves but what is <HI>agreable</HI> to God, and an <HI>Exhibition</HI> more or less of his <HI>Image</HI> on us. We should <HI>hate</HI> and loathe in our Selves whatsoever is <HI>contrary</HI> to God, his Nature and Will made known to us. We must <HI>deny</HI> our present <HI>carnal Self,</HI> which is <HI>Enmity to God, is not subject to his Law, nor indeed can be</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 2, 6, 7, 13. John iii. 7.

O that we did but <HI>know our Selves,</HI> and love our own Souls! we should then seek the <HI>Image of God</HI> within our Selves, and set a just Value on it.

<HI>Christians</HI> are under a more special Law of <HI>Love</HI> than others, from the Knowledge of God and <HI>his Love in Jesus Christ, that great Love wherewith he has loved us;</HI> and from the Example and Law of Christ, "<HI>A new Commandment give I unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you that ye love one another.</HI> And how is this <HI>new</HI> Commandment inforced and urged on us in the <HI>New Testament?</HI> but from the <HI>Image of God</HI> restored by Grace <HI>in the Godly.</HI> Therefore we must <HI>love the Brethren,</HI> and to <HI>Godliness</HI> add <HI>Brotherly Kindness.</HI> We should be able to see <HI>God</HI> in one another, and we must love the <HI>Godly in Christ Jesus</HI> for the sake of <HI>his Spirit</HI> in them, and their <HI>Likeness to Him.</HI> As <HI>Aaron</HI> and the <HI>Elders of Israel</HI> looked on the <HI>shining Face of Moses,</HI> when he came down from the <HI>Mount,</HI> with Wonder and great Reverence.

In one Word, For <HI>what</HI> is it that the Sons of Men <HI>exchange</HI> the Image of God in their Estrangement from Him, and in their Rebellions against him!

<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P N="5">V. Here is abundant Matter and Cause for that <HI>Evangelical Repentance,</HI> Humiliation, holy Mourning, Shame, Fear, Confession, Deprecation, and Agony of Soul after Pardon and Renovation, which the <HI>Gospel</HI> teaches and requires. The Doctrine of our Salvation must be a Doctrine of Repentance &amp; Re∣turn to God. In this the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI> returns to us. There is no other possible Way for it. Re∣pentance unto Life must be granted, revealed and published to us; and it must be wro't in us, we must be bro't into it. By what other Means can a Soul ever recover out of a state of Sin? Therefore <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> and the Holy JESUS, came all preaching <HI>Repentance.</HI> We must mourn for every single <HI>Act</HI> of Sin committed by us, how then ought we to bewail the Sin of our <HI>Nature,</HI> which is the Spring of all the Impurities of our Life!

<PB N="38" REF="004001_0053_10037517FA0FCCD0"/>Faith and Repentance! See it decribed by <HI>Zecha∣riah</HI> and exemplified in <HI>David;</HI> The <HI>Prophet</HI> gives the Promise of it, the <HI>Psalmist</HI> practises it. "<HI>I will pour</HI> (says the Promise of God) <HI>upon the House of David, and on the Inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of Grace and of Supplication, and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son, and shall be in Bitterness for him as one that is in Bitterness for his First-born.</HI> So the <HI>Psalmist practis'd</HI> in the Day of his great Repentance. "<HI>Have Mercy upon me, O God, according to thy Loving kindness; according to the Multitude of thy tender Mercies blot out my Trans∣gression! Wash me thro'ly from mine Iniquity, &amp; cleanse me from my Sin; for I acknowledge my Transgressions, and my Sin is ever before me!— Behold I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me!

<P N="6">VI.

And yet not greater than theirs who despise the Gospel and perish under the Light thereof: For <HI>Devils</HI> ne∣ver sinned against an Offer of Mercy or Means of Grace, that we know of. The Son of God took not their Nature, to put them in a Way for the Recovery of their primitive Holiness and Glory. They <HI>saw</HI> him indeed in our Nature, but it was with <HI>Hatred</HI> and Indignation, which added to their Guilt and Judgment. They <HI>tempted</HI> him in Hope to have defeated the Design of our Redemption; but finding nothing in Him, and prevailing nothing

<P N="7">VII. See we then <HI>the Glory of the Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>the second Adam.</HI> The <HI>first Adam</HI> in all his Glory was not to be likned, or compared to Him. The first <HI>Adam</HI> was in his best Estate <HI>of the Earth earthy, the second Man is the Lord from Heaven; the first Adam was made a living Soul, the second Adam a quickning Spirit</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 45, 47. Col. i. 5.2 Cor. iv. 6. John. i. 14. Col. i. 13. Prov. xxx. 4. Col. ii 9.</NOTE>. There is as much Difference between the <HI>Image of God in meer Men,</HI> and that in the <HI>Man Christ Jesus,</HI> as there is between Earth and Heaven, between God and his Creature, between a living Soul and Him that made it, between <HI>Him that has Life in Himself</HI> and communicates Life natural and spiritual, and him that receives it. Accordingly we read of CHRIST, that He is <HI>the Image of the Invisible God, the Heir of all things, the Brightness of the Fathers Glory, the express Image of his Person, having by Inheritance a more excellent Name than Angels,</HI> the Object of their <HI>Worship;</HI> And yet they are <HI>Domini∣ons and Thrones and Principalities and Powers:</HI> To the SON it is therefore said, "<HI>Thy Throne, O GOD, is for ever and ever!</HI> Agreably we read again, of <HI>the Light of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ,</HI> and that <HI>his Glory was beheld as the Glory of the Only-Begotten of the Father.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="004001_0055_10037526C28EEC28"/>
Such is the <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Eternal Father</HI> in his <HI>dear Son,</HI> by an ineffable Communication of Essence, or by an unsearchable Self-existence, is not for us to say! <HI>for what is his Sons Name? if thou canst tell.</HI></P>
<P>Was <HI>Adam</HI> created <HI>wise</HI> in the Likeness of God? <HI>Christ</HI> is the <HI>Wisdom of God;</HI> the <HI>Serpent</HI> with all his Subtlety could not <HI>beguile</HI> him, neither in the <HI>Desart</HI> nor in the <HI>City.</HI> Was <HI>Adam</HI> made <HI>holy</HI> in the Like∣ness of God? <HI>Christ</HI> was the <HI>Holy One of God;</HI> seen and confessed to be so both by Angels and Devils. Was <HI>Adam</HI> made <HI>Lord</HI> of the Creatures on Earth? <HI>Christ</HI> is set down on <HI>the Right Hand of the Majesty in the Heavens; Angels Authorities and Powers being made subject to Him.</HI> And was <HI>Adam</HI> made <HI>blessed</HI> and <HI>happy</HI> in the Likeness of God? of <HI>Christ</HI> we read that God has made Him <HI>most blessed for evermore.</HI> — In one word, the incommunicable <HI>Glories</HI> of the Eternal and Unchangeable <HI>Godhead</HI> are in <HI>Christ, in whom dwelleth the Fulness of the Godhead bodily.</HI> — But let us descend to the poor <HI>Members of Christ</HI> on Earth.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. What must we then think and say <HI>of the Saints on Earth?</HI> of <HI>Souls Regenerated by the Spirit of God,</HI> converted from Sin and sanctified to God; adopted in Jesus Christ, pardoned and justified; again made Children and Heirs of God! Why, the <HI>Image of God</HI> is in part <HI>restored</HI> in them, and will soon be <HI>perfected</HI> in 'em. How else should God justify them, put 'em among his Children, and de∣clare them Heirs of Heaven? Well might the A∣postle <HI>John</HI> speak with Admiration of this <HI>new Crea∣tion</HI> of God, the Conformity of <HI>renewed Souls</HI> to the Image of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and their Adoption in Him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John. iii. 1, 2, 3. Rom. xii. 2.</NOTE>; <HI>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we should be called the Sons of God!
<PB N="41" REF="004001_0056_1003752D70F60308"/>therefore the World knoweth us not, because it knew Him not: Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when He shall appear we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is: And every One that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himself even as He is pure.</HI></P>
<P>See the Blessedness of a State of <HI>Grace</HI> here and of <HI>Glory</HI> for ever! the Image of God is <HI>begun</HI> in this Life, and will be <HI>perfected</HI> in the next. The Sancti∣fied in Jesus Christ are <HI>renewed in Knowledge,</HI> and made <HI>Light in the Lord;</HI> they are <HI>after God created in Righteousness,</HI> are made <HI>free from Sin</HI> and are translated into the <HI>glorious Liberty of the Children of God.</HI> They are <HI>begotten to the lively Hope of the Inheritance incor∣ruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for them.</HI> Thus does the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> mag∣nify the <HI>Regenerate State,</HI> and set it before the Eyes of Men in a <HI>Divine</HI> Light, that all may see the Ne∣cessity and Excellency of the <HI>true Salvation</HI> of Souls; which is <HI>the Recovery of the Image and Likeness of God,</HI> wherein we were at first created. So that all the <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Directions</HI> of the Gospel do at last expire in those Words to the <HI>Romans, "And be ye transformed by the renewing of your Minds, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable and perfect Will of God.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. Think and infer from all, <HI>what Heaven is,</HI> and what the <HI>Caelestial Glory and Blessedness</HI> will be found by the happy Partakers thereof! then the <HI>Image of God and Christ will be perfected in the Saints!</HI> They will <HI>shine forth</HI> in the Kingdom of their <HI>Father, wise holy blessed dignified</HI> for ever &amp; ever. And this glorious Likeness to God will be for ever <HI>growing</HI> in 'em, to their increasing <HI>Joys</HI> for ever and ever.—This is <HI>Heaven, Paradise regain'd,</HI> the <HI>Jerusalem from above, with the Glory of God upon it.</HI> This is <HI>Vision,</HI> to be more and more <HI>like God,</HI> by seeing Him as he is. This is to <HI>know even as we are known;</HI> to see
<PB N="42" REF="004001_0057_10035928F64F1380"/>the <HI>Face</HI> of God in his <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Image</HI> on us. This is <HI>the Tree of Life,</HI> with <HI>all manner of Fruit;</HI> and this the <HI>Water of Life</HI> from the <HI>Throne of God</HI> and <HI>of the Lamb:</HI> And there can be <HI>no more Curse,</HI> no more any <HI>Loss</HI> or Want for ever of the <HI>Likeness and Love</HI> of God; but the highest Blessedness in the everlasting Enjoyment of <HI>both;</HI> and <HI>they shall reign for ever and ever.</HI> Revel. xxii. 1,—5.</P>
<P>And here let us contemplate, for a Moment, the UNITY of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of God; how they <HI>begin</HI> and <HI>end,</HI> and thro' every Part agree and are <HI>one</HI> in <HI>This;</HI> "Man <HI>created</HI> in the <HI>Image</HI> of God and most <HI>happy</HI> therein; but presently <HI>miserable</HI> by sinning against God in the <HI>Loss</HI> of God's Likeness and Favour: Then the <HI>Seed of the Woman</HI> is revealed, <HI>recovering</HI> Souls into the Favour of God, by <HI>renewing</HI> them in Knowledge and Holiness, after the <HI>Image</HI> of Him that created them, and so making them <HI>meet</HI> for the <HI>Heavenly Paradise.</HI>—Whosoever looks through the <HI>Book</HI> of God, may easily see this one <HI>Line</HI> drawn thro' the <HI>whole</HI> of it; than <HI>which</HI> nothing can be more worthy of God, nor more necessary for us, and level to us.—And I know no more short and plain <HI>Argument</HI> of the <HI>Authority</HI> of the Holy Scriptures than <HI>this View of their Unity</HI> gives unto us. <Q>Such a <HI>Unity of Design,</HI> in all the Parts of <HI>Scripture,</HI> tho' written by different <HI>Persons,</HI> in different <HI>Ages,</HI></Q> and in such a <HI>Manner</HI> as the Scripture is delivered, Histo∣rical, Doctrinal, Legislative, Prophetical, Devoti∣onal, and Hortatory; seems utterly inconsistent with either <HI>Imposture</HI> or <HI>Enthusiam;</HI> one or other of which must be the <HI>Charge</HI> that <HI>Infidels</HI> bring against our <HI>Belief</HI> of their <HI>Inspiration</HI> of God.</P>
<P>"Shew if you can (says a late learned Writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>Essay</HI> on the several <HI>Dispensations</HI> of God to Mankind.</NOTE>) a single <HI>Enthusiast</HI> that is consistent with himself thro'
<PB N="43" REF="004001_0058_1003753B8B4D0548"/>many Volumes. If then it shall appear, that there is <HI>one</HI> worthy and noble Design pursued thro' the Books of the <HI>Old and New Testament,</HI> by one wise plain and simple Mean, tho' they had forty or more dif∣ferent Authors and were not written in less than sixteen hundred Years; it will amount to the clearest Demonstration that the <HI>Bible</HI> must be from HIM who exists thro' all Ages, and sees all that is past, pre∣sent and to come, who has always the same View, &amp;c." <HI>Thus He.</HI></P>
<P>Upon all therefore, as the natural <HI>Result</HI> and Con∣sequence of what has been said,</P>
<P N="10">X. And lastly, How <HI>dear and precious,</HI> infinitely so, should <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Gospel</HI> be to us? and what can we think or say of <HI>our Selves</HI> if we <HI>refuse Him in the Proposals of it?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Design</HI> and End of <HI>Christ</HI>'s coming into the World is to <HI>restore the lost Image of God</HI> in us, and to <HI>recover us into the Divine Likeness,</HI> Love and Fa∣vour; to our primitive Holiness and Blessedness, Dominion and Glory, and to <HI>a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</HI> He took our Nature and died in it to make us <HI>New Creatures,</HI> such as God at first made us; <HI>His Workmanship</HI> a second time, <HI>created in Christ Jesus unto good Works.</HI> He came to deliver Souls from the Power of <HI>Satan,</HI> and to <HI>bruise the Serpent's Head under the Feet of his</HI> Elect, that they should <HI>trample on the Lion and the Dragon. He gave himself for us to redeem us from all Iniquity, and to purify unto himself a peculiar People zealous of good Works</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 17. Gal. vi. 15. Eph. ii. 10. Rom. xvi. 20. Psal. xci. 13. Tit. ii 14. Psal xl 8. Rom. vii. 22.</NOTE>. This should make Christ <HI>glorious</HI> in our Eyes that he saves <HI>only in this Way of Holiness</HI> thro' <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Obedience to the Truth:</HI> So that every renewed Soul can say
<PB N="44" REF="004001_0059_10037542EC328B70"/>after him, <HI>"Lord, thy Law is within me, I delight to do thy Will, O God.</HI> O what a Change is this! into the Likeness of Man's Original State! <HI>"I de∣light in the Law of God after the inward Man.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>this Cause</HI> should the written and preached <HI>Gospel</HI> be very <HI>dear</HI> to us; it being the declared End, Use, Power and Efficacy thereof, to restore the lost <HI>Image</HI> of God in us. It is the blessed Means of holy Knowledge and saving <HI>Illumination;</HI> and of the <HI>Purification</HI> of Souls for Communion with God: <HI>Ye have purified your Souls in obeying the Truth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 22. Psal. cx. 2 3. Rom. i 16. Hebrews il. 1, 2, 3. 2. Cor. iv. 3, 4.</NOTE>. It is the Means of <HI>spiritual Dominion,</HI> Freedom from Sin and Liberty to what is good and holy: <HI>Thy People shall be willing in the Day of thy Power, in the Beau∣ties of Holiness.</HI> It is the Means of infinite <HI>Blessed∣ness</HI> unto Souls in the Likeness and Love of God. <HI>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my Self to him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We ought therefore to give the more earnest Heed to the Things which we have heard,</HI> to the Doctrines Precepts and Motives of the Gospel, <HI>lest at any Time we should let them slip</HI> out of our Minds and Hearts; for <HI>how shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI> the Recovery of the lost <HI>Image of God</HI> in our Souls, and thereby the <HI>Pleasure and Delight</HI> of God in us, which supposes and secures a state of <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> everlasting. What can God himself <HI>propose better</HI> for us than <HI>such</HI> Salvation? the <HI>same</HI> Felicity which he <HI>at first</HI> made us for and made us in. What can our <HI>own Souls desire</HI> or wish for beyond this, or any thing beside it? to have the <HI>Likeness</HI> of God restored in them, or to be restored in <HI>his</HI> Eye and Heart! and by this Means to be made <HI>meet</HI> for the Vision of God, and for Blessedness
<PB N="45" REF="004001_0060_100375495E8CD4D0"/>in Him to all Eternity! And indeed there is <HI>no other</HI> Way to the true and proper perfect Happiness of Man; for <HI>without Holiness no Man can see God.</HI> Without <HI>Likeness</HI> there can be no <HI>Love;</HI> no Love in <HI>God</HI> to us, no Love in <HI>us</HI> to God, and <HI>both</HI> are necessary to the <HI>Felicity</HI> of Souls, whether in the Body or out of it.</P>
<P>O the <HI>Misery</HI> of Souls then, who by their Disobe∣dience and Impenitency under the Gospel do in Effect say to God, <HI>"Depart from us, we desire not the Knowledge of Thee;</HI> the Recovery of <HI>Likeness</HI> to Thee or any <HI>Communion</HI> with Thee! O the <HI>Mi∣sery</HI> of that Soul, which having <HI>lost</HI> the Image of God and his Love, is <HI>content</HI> in the Want of it; seeks not the Recovery of it, nay refuses the Means thereof! <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine into them.</HI> The same <HI>Serpent,</HI> the Devil, and <HI>Satan,</HI> who deceived our <HI>first Parents</HI> into the Loss of <HI>God's Image,</HI> still blinds and <HI>hardens</HI> Sinners, under the Light of the preached Gospel, and they wilfully refuse the <HI>Recovery</HI> of it in their own Souls. Sinners chuse to perish under <HI>Ignorance</HI> of God, <HI>Lust, Servitude</HI> and <HI>Death;</HI> when <HI>Light, Holiness, Liberty, Glory Honour and Immortality</HI> are set before them and tender'd to 'em. They perish therefore with∣out <HI>Excuse,</HI> and everlasting <HI>Remorse</HI> will be their Torment. The <HI>Sacrifice of Christ</HI> will be so far from saving them, that <HI>his Blood cries</HI> against them, and will inflame their Consciences for Evermore. As it is written, <HI>Hebrews</HI> x. 26,—31.</P>
<P>How <HI>earnest</HI> therefore and <HI>instant</HI> should we be in seeking the <HI>Recovery</HI> of the lost <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Like∣ness</HI> of God, with our whole Soul? the <HI>Beginning</HI> of it in this Life, tho' here we can <HI>but know in part and prophesie in part, understand as a Child and speak
