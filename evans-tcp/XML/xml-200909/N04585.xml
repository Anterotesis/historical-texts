<Q><BIBL><HI>ROMANS XII. 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For I say, through the Grace given unto me, to every Man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every Man the Measure of Faith.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle having in the first Verse of this Chapter, affectionately Ex∣horted the believing <HI>Romans,</HI> to Ho∣liness in general; does more parti∣ticularly in the following Verses, disswade them from two Evils which are great Hin∣drances thereof, <HI>viz. Conformity to the sinful Customs of the World,</HI> and <HI>high Thoughts of their own Attainments.</HI> It is the last of these which the Apostle speaks against in the Words of our Text, <HI>For I say through the Grace given unto me: i. e.</HI> I require and enjoyn you, by the Authority that God has graciously given me as an Apostle, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>to every Man that is among you: i. e.</HI> To one as well as another: As if the Apostle had said; I address you all, my
<PB N="4" REF="005696_0003_1026C14CB7DD3948"/>
Brethren, as if I particularly mentioned your Names; I except none of any Condition or Character, for you all need the Injunction, <HI>not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think: i. e.</HI> Not to be proud or puffed up with overweening extravagant Conceits of his Endowments and Attain∣ments, such as wisdom, ability, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to think soberly, <HI>i. e.</HI> modestly; <Q>let him contain himself within Bounds, and not take upon him what doth not belong to him; let him not contemn others, and pretend to more than he hath. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Pool</HI>'s Annotations</NOTE></Q> <HI>As God hath dealt to every Man the Measure of Faith.</HI> By Faith the Apostle doubtless intends, spi∣ritual Gifts, which are called Faith, because they are given with it, and exercis'd by it. These Gifts are given forth in various De∣grees or Measures to the Children of Men, a modest Notice of which, we may, and ought to take, that so we may be induc'd to give to God the Glory of them, and en∣courag'd to improve them for his Honour and Kingdom. But then we should be care∣ful that we do not indulge an unreasonable Conceit of the Extent of our Powers, or
<PB N="5" REF="005696_0004_1026C14E4199DDC8"/>
Measure of our Talents, imagining them to be much greater than they are; for tho' that may flatter our Arrogance, yet it betrays our Ignorance and Weakness; it is as inju∣rious to our Honour among the Intelligent, as it is prejudicial to our Usefulness in the World. It is surely a great Instance of true Wisdom, to think soberly of our selves; and hence the original Word <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sophronein.</NOTE> in our Text, signifies <HI>to be wise to sobriety.</HI> Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> justly observes, That there is an elegant Paranomasia, (or symphony of Sounds) in this Place of Scripture in the <HI>Greek,</HI> which our Language cannot reach. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Me uperphronein, par O Dei phronein alla phronein, eis to Sophronein.</NOTE></P>
<P>From what hath been said I would observe, That even good Men are in great Danger of spiritual Pride, and of being puffed up for a Time with groundless and foolish Conceits of their Attainments. If this was not the Case, there wou'd have been no Need of the Injunction in our Text; nether wou'd their have been any Necessity of a Messen∣ger of Satan sent to buffet <HI>Paul,</HI> least he should be lifted up thro' the Abundance of Reve∣lations that were given him.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005696_0005_1026C150F4E03588"/>In Discoursing upon this Subject, I shall speak upon the <HI>Nature, Ingredients, Causes, Fruits</HI> and <HI>Cure of spiritual Pride.</HI></P>
<P>Now Pride, as to its general Nature, may be thus describ'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a ground∣less Conceit of our Attainments, accompa∣nied with an inordinate Desire of our own Honour and Contempt of our Neighbour's Excellencies and Credit. To understand which, let the following <HI>Ingredients</HI> (or par∣ticulars included in it) be consider'd, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First: High-Mindedness,</HI> which is the Loftiness or Swelling of the Mind with un∣reasonable Self-Conceit. When Persons have too high Thoughts of their Powers and Talents, and are hereby disposed to over-value themselves and undervalue others; this is as natural to Mankind as it is unreasonable in it self, and fatal in its Consequnces. A∣gainst this pernicious Evil, the Text I am discoursing upon is expresly Directed. This is indeed the bitter Root, the poysonous Fountain from which the other sinful Ingredi∣ents grasp'd in spiritual Pride (which I shall anon mention) do flow. Against this the A∣postle
<PB N="7" REF="005696_0006_1026C154BB3009E0"/>
<HI>Paul</HI> excellently cautions the Gentile Churches, in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 20.</NOTE> in the following Words: <HI>Well, because of Unbelief they were broken off;</HI> (meaning the <HI>Jews) and thou standest by Faith. Be not high minded but fear.</HI> Now altho' gracious Persons may for a Time be carried away with High-Mindedness, thro' the Violence of Temptation; yet to be under the Habi∣tual or general Government of it, is certain∣ly an Evidence of a bad State towards God. This the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> assures us of in his Epistle to <HI>Timothy</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot" N="‡">2 Tim. iii. 3, 4.</NOTE> in these Words: <HI>With∣out natural Affection, truce Breakers, false Accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traytors, Heady, high Minded, Lovers of Pleasures more than Lovers of God.</HI> Upon these Words, <HI>viz. heady, high-minded,</HI> Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> thus glosseth: <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Pool's <HI>Annotations</HI> in loc.</NOTE> <Q>Rash, incon∣siderate, blown up as Bladders with an Opinion of their own Deserts.</Q> You may observe in the Verses now quoted, that the Apostle puts high-minded Persons in the same Catalogue with the grossest Trans∣gressors, and declares that they love not
<PB N="8" REF="005696_0007_1026C15644C24AD0"/>
God transcendently. Surely those that are renewed by the Holy Ghost, do <HI>learn of Jesus to be meek and lowly</HI> in their habitu∣al Temper of Mind and outward Behaviour. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 29.</NOTE> They are made to <HI>receive the Kingdom of Heaven as little Children,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 17.</NOTE> <HI>are Fools</HI> in their own Eyes; <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 18.</NOTE> and in comparison of many others, they sometimes see themselves to be in respect of Knowledge, <HI>but as brute Beasts.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Apostle in his Epistle to the <HI>Colo∣ssians,</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Coloss. ii. 18.</NOTE> justly Terms high-mindedness, to be the <HI>puffing up of a Person, vainly by his fleshly Mind;</HI> probably alluding to Liquors swelling by the Yest into Spume and Froth, which has a Shew but no Solidity. For indeed, Pride is to the Mind of Man, in respect of Agitation and Tumor, as Yest is to Liquors.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> in spiritual Pride is <HI>Ambition,</HI> which is an inordinate Seeking of Dignity, or high Places; proud Persons have aspiring Thoughts, and ima∣gine themselves to be the fittest to manage the Helm of the State, or the Church; and if
<PB N="9" REF="005696_0008_1026C158B9631210"/>
others don't think so, they are not well pleas'd; they cannot bear to have others preferred before them, altho' the Preference be just and reasonable. Something of this sinful Temper appear'd in the Apostles Conduct, before the extraordinary Effusion of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost; <HI>there was also a Strife among them which of them should be accounted the Greatest.</HI> This our Lord seasonably opposed, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 24, 25, 26.</NOTE> and for what we can learn, it soon evanish'd. But when a Love of Preheminence among the Brethren is habitual as well as inordinate, and attend∣ed with a <HI>malicious pratting</HI> against the faithful Servants of Christ, on the Account of small Differences in Sentiment or Prac∣tice, which seems to have been the Case of <HI>Diotrephes,</HI> as the Apostle <HI>John</HI> informs us, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">3 Epist. 9, 10.</NOTE> it is an awful Sign of a bad State! But to proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> in spiritual Pride is <HI>Arrogance;</HI> which consists in pre∣tending to what we have not, and in desir∣ing that others should think of us above what we are or have; this was the Practice
<PB N="10" REF="005696_0009_1026C15A43953C80"/>
of the false Teachers who troubled the Church of <HI>Corinth;</HI> they commended them∣selves by boasting of Things beyond their Measure, hereby seeking to lessen their Esteem of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> and other sound Preach∣ers. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 10,—12, 13.</NOTE> The very contrary whereof he de∣termined shou'd be the Measure of his Con∣duct: <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>For we dare not,</HI> (says he) <HI>make our selves of the Number, or compare our selves with some that commend themselves.— But we will not boast of Things without our Measure, but according to the Measure of the Rule which God hath distributed to us.</HI> This leads me</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly:</HI> To another particular included in spiritual Pride, which is <HI>boasting</HI> of the <HI>Gifts</HI> or <HI>Graces</HI> which we really have: Proud Persons and Boasters are put together in the same Class by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in his E∣pistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 30.</NOTE> thus, <HI>Backbiters, haters, of God, despiteful, Proud, Boasters.</HI> Proud Persons are full of Blaze and Osten∣tation about their Attainments; they take up much of their Time in trumpeting their own Praises, either more openly or covertly,
<PB N="11" REF="005696_0010_1026C15D9BD970B8"/>
and wou'd have all to admire them without Cause, as they do themselves. But this low Artifice, procures not for them the Esteem and Respect they desire and Design from the Judicious, but the Contrary.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> in spiritual Pride is, <HI>Contempt</HI> of, and <HI>Envy</HI> against o∣thers <HI>Excellencies,</HI> because they stand in our Light and seem to diminish our Lustre. This the Apostle <HI>James</HI> confirms <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jam. iv. 5, 6.</NOTE> in the following Words: <HI>Do ye think that the Scripture sayeth in vain, the Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy.</HI>—Wherefore he sayeth, <HI>God resisteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble.</HI> As much as we over∣value our own Attainments, so much will we be enclined to undervalue others, that so we may Triumph in an imaginary Assen∣dant over them. But this Disposition of Mind is very Displeasing to God and detri∣mental to us; and hence <HI>Solomon</HI> assures us, <HI>that the Almighty scorneth the Scorners, but giveth Grace unto the lowly.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 34.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Sixthly:</HI> Another <HI>Ingredient</HI> is <HI>Presump∣tion,</HI> which appears in our attempting what
<PB N="12" REF="005696_0011_1026C16102526FC8"/>
exceeds our Strength, and medling with Things two high for us. Proud Persons are full of vain Confidence, not knowing their Ignorance and Weakness, they rush into Snares and grasp at a Weight which their Shoulders are not equal to. Directly con∣trary to this was the <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s Practice, and hence he was able to appeal to God in the following Language: <HI>Lord my Heart is not haughty nor mine Eyes lofty, neither do I ex∣ercise my self in great Matters, or in Things too high for me.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxxi. 1.</NOTE> In these Words it is plainly intimated, that haughty or proud Persons have lofty Looks, and are disposed to meddle with Things above their Capaci∣ty, which turns to their Disgrace in the Issue.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Causes</HI> of <HI>Pride</HI> are these, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Our <HI>Violation</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Works,</HI> by this we have lost the Image of God, and contracted that of the Devil, of which <HI>Pride</HI> is a dreadful Lineament, <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 18. Rom. iii. 12.19.</NOTE> and altho' the Governing Power of this evil be broken by Conversion, yet there are such Remains of it, as will be a Grief
<PB N="13" REF="005696_0012_1026C162881F0E48"/>
and Exercise to us while we live. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 24.</NOTE> This Original Apostacy is therefore the prima∣ry Cause of Pride. But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A more immediate Cause is the <HI>neglect of our own Hearts.</HI> If these were constantly watch'd, and frequently examin∣ed, as they should be, we would see con∣tinual Reason for Humiliation, and have an Opportuniry of giving check to the first budings of Pride within us; But when our Hearts are neglected, our Wickedness is hid from us, the first Motions of Sin are not oppos'd, and thus we are <HI>puff'd up in our vain Imaginations,</HI> and look on our selves in a false Light.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Another <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Pride,</HI> is the <HI>Temptations of the Devil.</HI> He tries to blow the Coal of Corruptions in us to a Flame; he sooths our Vanity, and flatters our Arro∣gance until we fall from the imaginary Pi∣nacle into the Myre. Thus he treated <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah;</HI> the former he stirr'd up to Number the People, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. xxi. 17.</NOTE> and the Latter to shew his Treasures to the <HI>Assy∣rian</HI> Ambassador, which brought Wrath upon the Nation.<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxxix. 4—7</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005696_0013_1026C1640EC84570"/><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>groundless Esteem</HI> and <HI>Ap∣plause</HI> of <HI>ignorant People,</HI> and the <HI>Hypocriti∣cal Panegyricks</HI> of <HI>designing Parasites,</HI> are apt to stir up Pride, tho' they be equally un∣worthy of our Notice; for the former know not our Weakness, and the latter are not so Honest as to acquaint us of it.</P>
<P>It is true, Applause is apt, at first especi∣ally, to affect and please us; for as <HI>Solomon</HI> observes, <HI>as the fining Pot is for Silver, and the Furnace for Gold, so is a Man to his Praise.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Proverbs xxvii. 21.</NOTE> However it is a Sign of a weak Mind to be frequently overcome by such a Temptation! Certainly the less Knowledge we have of God, our selves, or the Things of God, and the smaller Measure of Divine Grace we possess, the more apt we are to be puff'd up. Superficial Notions of Things give Occasion for Pride, but a thorough Knowledge of them has a humbling Ten∣dency.</P>
<P>But I proceed to speak of the <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Pride,</HI> and that both in Relation to <HI>God, our selves,</HI> and <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>Now in <HI>Relation to God, Pride</HI> has the
<PB N="15" REF="005696_0014_1026C167B3F010F8"/>
following awful <HI>Fruits!</HI> It disposes to con∣temn his <HI>Authority,</HI> to slight his <HI>Love,</HI> to murmur at his <HI>Providence,</HI> and refuse a <HI>Sub∣mission</HI> to his <HI>Righteousness,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> disposes to disdain the Divine <HI>Au∣thority</HI> and Government, like the wicked <HI>Israelites,</HI> of whom the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> speaks. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 31.</NOTE> <HI>They said they were Lords and would come no more to the Almighty.</HI> Surely those that wou'd hear the Commands of God to Purpose, must oppose Pride, and hence the Prophet intreated the People of <HI>Israel</HI> in the following Manner, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xiii. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Hear ye, be not proud for the Lord hath spoken.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed <HI>Pride</HI> does equally dispose to <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> against the Divine Love and Goodness. The Reason of which is this, such Persons have a high Opinion of their own Excellency's, and hence are in∣clin'd to look upon the Gifts of God, as less then their Merit.</P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> does likewise for the same Reason dispose Men to <HI>murmur</HI> at God's <HI>providential Government,</HI> of the World in general, and of their Lot in Particular. They think that
<PB N="16" REF="005696_0015_1026C16940AE7428"/>
Things are not so well manag'd as they should be, and especially as to their Cir∣cumstances: The Language of which is, that had they been of God's Council, they could have taught him Knowledge. O blasphemous Arrogance!</P>
<P>I may add, that another <HI>Fruit</HI> of <HI>Pride</HI> in Relation to God, is the Sinners <HI>Labour</HI> to <HI>establish a Way of Justification by his own Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>his Refusal of Submission to the Righteousness of God.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 3.</NOTE> The Pride of Man's Heart is such, that he dislikes to be strip'd of all Self-Dependance, and sav'd in a Way of pure Grace! But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Fruits of Pride in Relati∣on to our selves, are these; viz. It tends to deceive us, as to our <HI>State of Soul, and Progress in Religion, as well as to corrupt us in Principle and Practice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> tends to <HI>deceive</HI> us as to the <HI>State</HI> of our <HI>Souls,</HI> by inclining us to think that we are something when we are nothing. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 3.</NOTE> Many are prompted by the Pride of their Hearts, to take Conviction for Conversion; legal, for evangelical Sorrow, and Presumption for
<PB N="17" REF="005696_0016_1026C16C98B4F768"/>
that Faith which works by love, and changes the Life as well as the Heart. What avail such Comforts as do not humble the Soul and reform the Practice?</P>
<P>But if it does not entirely deceive us as to the State of our Souls, yet it tends to impose a cheat on us, as to our <HI>Progress</HI> in Religion, and to rob us of the <HI>Comforts</HI> of it; for by this we are inclined to think that we are better in Degree than we are, and for this God looks upon Sinners <HI>a-far off.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxxviii. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> has likewise awful Tendency to <HI>cor∣rupt</HI> us in <HI>principle;</HI> and no wonder, because it gives access to the influence of that proud Spirit who is the Father of Lies, and great <HI>Heresiarch;</HI> as well as creates an Aversion to Truth, which is of a humble Tendency, and so its con∣trary. It was a just Observation of <HI>Austin,</HI> "That Pride is the Mother of Hereticks." <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> who was the Hatcher of many Heresies, was a very proud Man; he gave out that <HI>he was some great one.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts. viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Pride makes Persons rash and positive in their O∣pinions, and that even about Things of a doubtful and circumstantial Nature, and will not give them leave to weigh well what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="18" REF="005696_0017_1026C16F282CE1B0"/>
objected against them. <Q>Mark those, saith one, who are turned any where from the Way of Truth, and see if they are not proud and conceited Persons.</Q></P>
<P>But this is not all, Pride also has a <HI>corrupt Influence</HI> upon the <HI>Practice;</HI> by this Men are disposed to neglect the secret Duties of Re∣legion, because of the Distance from God occasioned by it, and as to their publick Per∣formances; they are more for Show than Substance, regarding the Praises of Men more than of God. I may farther observe, That Pride inclines different Persons, yea sometimes the same Persons at different Times to contrary Vices: <HI>e. g.</HI> To Cove∣tousness and Prodigality. What is Covetous∣ness but the Purveyor of Pride, that greedily seeks something to support its grandeur; and hence the Prophet <HI>Habakkuk</HI> assures us, <HI>That the proud Man enlargeth his Desire as</HI> Hell, <HI>and is as Death and cannot be satisfied</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hab. ii. 5.</NOTE> And on the contrary, Men are prodigal from the same proud Principle, with design to appear great and to be talk'd of. But I hasten</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005696_0018_1026928955B5E838"/><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To shew the bad <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Pride</HI> in relation to <HI>others.</HI> And these are indeed many: such as <HI>lying, rash-judging, backbit∣ing, sinful Contention, hatred of Reproof</HI> and <HI>Schism!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Proud Persons</HI> are generally great <HI>Lyers;</HI> the inordinate Desire they have to be admired and applauded, makes them tell lies in order to answer that End, they knowingly and repeatedly stretch Things beyond the Truth in Conversation, that they may affect those they speak to, and excite either their Sur∣prize, Love, Admiration or Hatred, to a great Degree!</P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> likewise causes <HI>rash judging</HI> of others <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Conduct</HI> for small Matters. Too much of this unhappy Temper and Practise appear'd for a Time among both the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> Converts, in the Apostolick Day, they judg'd and censur'd one another severely for their different Opi∣nions and Practice about Days and Meats; <HI>Bigots</HI> on both sides of the Question were very positive and Fire-hot, yea to such a Degree of uncharitableness, did indiscreet and disproportion'd Zeal, carry those Igno∣rant but well meaning Zealots; that they
<PB N="20" REF="005696_0019_1026C171B4F1ECB0"/>
not only condemned one anothers States, but were also dispos'd to despise and reject one another out of Church Communion, on the Ac∣count of the aforesaid circumstantial Differen∣ces. This temper and Practice the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> condemns.<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>Let not him that eateth, (say∣eth he,) despise him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth, for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another Man's Servant? To his own Master he standeth or falleth.</HI> On the Contrary he recommends, <HI>Forbearance,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Love,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 32, 33. 1 Cor. viii. 13.

Act xxi. 20, 21, 24.</NOTE> <HI>Condescension,</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>Peace,</HI> and a <HI>mu∣tual receiving each other into Church Fellow∣ship.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 1. Rom xv. 7.</NOTE> But to proceed,</P>
<P>Another <HI>Fruit</HI> of <HI>Pride</HI> is, <HI>Whisperings</HI> and <HI>Backbitings;</HI> these the Apostle puts to∣gether in his Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii. 20.</NOTE> in these Words: <HI>Envyings, Wraths, Strifes, Bacbitings, Whisperings, Swellings, Tumults.</HI> Where there are Swellings of Pride, there will be Whisperings and Backbitings: Proud Persons will not content themselves, with

rash Judging of others in their Hearts, which is a great Evil; but they will reproach them with their Tongues also, that so they may raise their own Credit upon the Ruin of anothers Character!</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Pride</HI> causes by the Evils before mentioned, and many others, <HI>sinful Conten∣ition,</HI> and makes Persons <HI>hate Reproof;</HI> as <HI>So∣lomon</HI> observes, <HI>he that is of a proud Heart stireth up Strife:</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 25</NOTE> And he elsewhere in∣forms us, <HI>that a Scorner loveth not one that reproveth him.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov xv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Herod</HI> imprisoned <HI>John</HI> for telling him of his Sin, <HI>tho' he before re∣verenced him.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark vi. 20, 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>And indeed <HI>Pride</HI> makes Persons <HI>Separatists</HI> and <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> these are they saith <HI>Jude, with separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Jude xix.</NOTE> Undoubtedly <HI>Pride</HI> is the great Source of all those Divisions and Fac∣tions with which the Church of Christ has been rent and torn into so many Parts, from its early beginnings thro' the Successive Pe∣riods of Time to this Day! <HI>Pride</HI> does not only prompt Men to rend themselves from Churches, but also by unsound Doctrines
<PB N="22" REF="005696_0021_1026C1769DBAD700"/>
and other sinful Methods, to cause Divi∣sions in them. Of such the Apostle speaks in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans</HI> in the fol∣lowing Manner: <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 17, 18.</NOTE> <HI>Now I beseech you Bre∣thren, mark them that cause Divisions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrines which we have learned, and avoid them. For they that are such, serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own Belly; and by good Words and fair Speeches, deceive the Hearts of the simple.</HI> But it is Time to proceed to the last Gene∣ral Head of Discourse, which was to speak of the <HI>Cure</HI> of <HI>Pride;</HI> to which End I would observe,</P>
<P><HI>First:</HI> That it is necessary to <HI>inspect</HI> our own <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Lives,</HI> and labour to get a Sense of our Guilt as to this Sin; and doubtless all of us are in a greater or lesser Degree guilty of it; but such as are generally under its governing Power are in the Gaul of Bit∣terness and Bond of Iniquity, <HI>and therefore should repent of this their Wickedness, and pray to God, if perhaps, the Thoughts of their Hearts may be forgiven them</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act viii. 21.—23.</NOTE> And in∣deed, all that are in any Degree guilty of
<PB N="23" REF="005696_0022_1026C1783405C3A8"/>
this malignant Evil, have great Cause for Grief and Shame!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> We should <HI>consider</HI> seriously and frequently upon the <HI>Aggravations of this Sin;</HI> which are these following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st: It is an <HI>antient Evil,</HI> the first Ene∣my that ever God had: By this the Angels and our first Parents fell from their original Integrity and Happiness; the Angels want∣ing to be independent like God, became Devils; and we by the same Iniquity, have made our selves worse than Beasts.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, It is an <HI>unreasonable Evil;</HI> we have <HI>nothing</HI> to be proud of, who are sinful de∣pendent Creatures, that derive all the Good we possess from God, and carry our Breath in our Nostrils.</P>
<P>Neither the Endowments of Nature, Im∣provements of Art, or Aids of Birth and Fortune, tho' they raise Men above the common Level, give them reason for Pride or a Contempt of their Fellow-Creatures; when it is considered, that these Accom∣plishments were not their own originally, but the immerited Gifts of a soverign Pro∣vidence, which might have ordered us the Lot of Beggars or Ideots: Now seeing the
<PB N="24" REF="005696_0023_1026C17AB696B370"/>
difference between us and others is entirely owing to the divine Disposal, and we have received all our Gifts from God, <HI>wherefore should we glory as tho' we had not received them?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Continuance of those Things is also so short and uncertain, that it may justly give check to our aspiring Thoughts about them; it is the vainest Vanity to be high-minded, and trust in uncertain Riches, <HI>which often make to themselves Wings and fly away, as the Eagle towards Heaven!</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>But even tho' Wealth were permanent, yet its use is but narrow and limited, it can∣not satisfy the Desires of the Mind, or heal the Distresses of the Conscience; all the Treasures of the <HI>Indies</HI> cannot purchase a Balm for a wounded Spitit; and instead of curing the moral Disorders of the Soul, it is frequently the occasion of increasing them; yea there are many Miseries incident to human Life, wherein it can yield no Re∣lief: <HI>e. g.</HI> if a Man is afflicted with a Fit of the Gout or Stone, all the Banks of the Uni∣verse cannot purchase a Moments ease; and
<PB N="25" REF="005696_0024_1026C17F36DA4068"/>
if our Character is aspers'd, whole Ingots of Gold cannot stop the Mouth of Fame! What has been said of Wealth is justly ap∣plicable to other Gifts: <HI>and therefore let not the wise Man glory in his Wisdom, nor the mighty Man in his Might, nor the rich Man in his Riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me,</HI> sayeth the Almighty by the Prophet. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jer. ix. 23, 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>I may add, that it is very unreasonable for us to be proud, considering the Meanness of our Original; surely we had our rise from Nothing at first, and after we received a Being, it was, and is but a precarious One, and that conveyed with a criminal Taint, <HI>for we are shapen in Iniquity and conceiv'd in Sin.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm li. 5.</NOTE> Now it is enough to take down the Spirit of the brightest Intelligence, to consider that nothing was his Original, for this is a State more dishonourable than the Chaos it self; yet the Depravity with which we received our Nature, adds such an In∣crease of Meanness and Dishonour to our Original, as no Words are equal to!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Pride</HI> is a <HI>pregnant Evil,</HI> most of the Sins of the World are either contain'd
<PB N="26" REF="005696_0025_10269287788FC450"/>
in it, or issue from it, as appears in some Measure from what hath been said, to which let me add a few Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> strikes at the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all those <HI>Offices</HI> that we owe to our <HI>Neighbour;</HI> which take up the second Table of the Law: For if we slight our Neighbour, how shall we perform any Duty we owe to him?</P>
<P>And when we slight our Neighbour, do we not consequently <HI>contemn God,</HI> who has by his Authority enjoyn'd us to honour him?</P>
<P>Moreover by <HI>Pride</HI> we bring <HI>contempt</HI> upon <HI>ourselves: For as those that honour God, shall be honour'd by him; so those that contemn him, shall be lightly esteemed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. ii. 30.</NOTE></P>
<P>By <HI>Pride</HI> our Neighbour is wrong'd of that which is next to his Life, <HI>viz.</HI> His <HI>Character. Solomon</HI> justly observes, that <HI>a good Name is as precious Ointment.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Pro. vi. 16.17.</NOTE> Our Usefulness as well as Comfort do in some Measure depend upon our Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ion; both which are struck at by <HI>Pride.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pride,</HI> in its Tendency, breaks the <HI>Bands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>iety,</HI> and saps the Foundations of all
<PB N="27" REF="005696_0026_1026C184297C21E8"/>
social Justice, Comfort, and Benefit! It aims at the final Overthrow of all Society whether in Families, Churches, or Com∣mon-Wealths. The Comfort and Use of which depend upon that <HI>Honour</HI> which is due from Inferiors to their Superiors; with∣out which social Offices cannot be with Reason expected.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Pride,</HI> my Brethren, that brought <HI>Strife</HI> into <HI>Heaven</HI> it self, and cast down the Apostate Angels thence. It is <HI>Pride</HI> that robs God of the <HI>Honour</HI> due to his <HI>Providence,</HI> and makes Men guilty of the wildest <HI>Idolatry</HI> in burning Incense to their own Net!</P>
<P>Surely it is <HI>Pride</HI> that makes men so <HI>masterly</HI> and imperious in their Behaviour; so <HI>rash</HI> in their Judgments and Censures; so <HI>peevish</HI> in their Tempers, and <HI>obstinate</HI> in their Resolutions. This makes Men, <HI>Argus</HI>-ey'd, in spying <HI>Motes in their Brothers Eye,</HI> but as blind as <HI>Moles</HI> in not discerning <HI>the Beam that is in their own!</HI> And thus it prevents Repentance, and puts a Bar to improvement. It makes Men storm at re∣proof, and deaf to Advice and Council: It magnifies the slender Shadow of Piety and Virtue in those that are under its Go∣vernment,
<PB N="28" REF="005696_0027_1026C185AF47BE98"/>
and silences the Checks of Con∣science. And thus it paves the Way for Delusion and Ruin! Which brings me to say,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly:</HI> That Pride is a <HI>God-provoking Evil.</HI> It is one of the Six Things that God hates, yea of the Seven which is an Abo∣mination to him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. 16.17.</NOTE> And hence we are told that he resists the Proud, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">James iv. 6.</NOTE> and looks on them afar off: <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxxviii. 6.</NOTE> As if they were not fit, as one expresseth it, to be touch'd with a pair of Tongs. And <HI>Jehovah</HI> likewise assures us, <HI>that Pride goes before Destruction, and a high Mind before a Fall.</HI> <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 18.</NOTE> But,</P>
<P N="3">3dly: We should not only think often on the <HI>Aggravations of Pride,</HI> but likewise up∣on the <HI>Imperfections</HI> of our <HI>Graces</HI> and <HI>Du∣ties;</HI> how weak are the former and corrupt the latter? How much Water is mingled with our Wine, and Dross with our Silver?</P>
<P N="4">4thly, We should often <HI>meditate</HI> upon the <HI>Evils of our Hearts</HI> and <HI>Practice:</HI> Shall we be proud who have such a Sink of Wicked∣ness within us? Who have done so little for God and so much against him?</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="005696_0028_1026C18745136870"/><HI>Fifthly:</HI> We should also <HI>think</HI> frequently upon <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Judgment:</HI> Shall such dy∣ing Worms as we be proud, who must be so soon reduced to rotteness, and brought to a strict Account for all our Talents? As to civil Differences, they'll soon be levelled in undistinguish'd Dust!</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly:</HI> My dear Brethren! let us <HI>seek</HI> after more of the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>greater Nearness to him,</HI> both which have a noble Tendency to break the Pride of our Hearts, it was this that made <HI>Job abhor him∣self,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xlii. 6.</NOTE> and <HI>Isaiah</HI> complain, <HI>that he was a Man of unclean Lips!</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. vi. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Seventhly: Think</HI> often on the <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>Cloud</HI> of <HI>Witnesses</HI> that have gone before you to Glory; particularly upon <HI>Abraham,</HI> who in his Supplication, express'd the hum∣blest Reverence of God's Majesty; behold, said he, <HI>I who am but Dust and Ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord, O let not the Lord be angry!</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii. 27.</NOTE> Upon <HI>David</HI> who was abased by the Thoughts of the divine Goodness to him, saying, <HI>What am I, and what is my Father's House, that thou has
<PB N="30" REF="005696_0029_1026C18AAF5F6160"/>
brought me hitherto?</HI> There are also many others that deserve your Thoughts and Imi∣tation, which time would fail to enumerate! and therefore I proceed to say,</P>
<P><HI>Eightly: Think</HI> on the <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>Christ's Humility,</HI> who tho' he was <HI>in the Form of God, assumed the Form of a Servant:</HI> And shall not we for whose Sake this was done be <HI>cloathed with Humility,</HI> and seek to have <HI>the same Mind in us which was also in Christ Jesus?</HI> Surely the astonishing Stoop of Divine Majesty, to the humblest Circumstances of Humanity, may make us asham'd of ambitious Aspirings!</P>
<P>In fine, my dear Brethren! It should be seriously considered that the subduing of our Pride, is the Design of God's providential Dealings towards us, both in its prosperous and adverse Occurrences. The former should make us asham'd of it, and the latter imbitter it to us! O! therefore let us op∣pose the Stirrings of that malignant Disorder in us, and invite the Assistance of Heaven by importunate Supplications; in the mean Time, <HI>thinking of our selves soberly as we ought to think.</HI></P>
