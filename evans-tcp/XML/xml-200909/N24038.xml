</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the laudible purpose of our institution, by the most agreeable means, to expand our hearts for all the offices of humanity. It does not destroy, nor even weaken the love of private interest, of kindred, nations, or
<PB N="6" REF="031799_0004_0FEE7291B5AA01B0"/>opinions. It is intended to assist a generous energy of mind, in rising to the highest obli∣gations of charity. It accomplishes its end, by creating a society, in which we familiarize its special duties, by a voluntary association with all parts of the family into which we en∣ter. The strongest prejudices are such only as exist in every kindred, which has a duty and affection, not directed by pure character, but by an established, immutable, and public relation. We embrace friends through the world. He that is first in such a family among brethren, should be social in his disposition, open in his temper, safe in his habits, firm in his character, and reputable in the world. To deserve this preference, and to receive it, must be the highest honour. From the per∣suasion or this truth, my Brethren, I rise with cheerfulness, in the service you have as∣signed me, in bearing your public testimony to this sentiment. We are Brethren. Duties belong to each; but different duties to all. The wisdom of the head; the sincerity of the heart; the benevolence of the temper; the quickness of the senses; and the organic life, in each part, form the perfection of the
<PB N="7" REF="031799_0005_0FEE729343E29548"/>whole. But all these parts have not the same office, nor the same resources. If the head be sound, each faculty more readily finds its full employment and use. The head, then, is the most honourable. Equal as are all friendships, with society, we begin a necessary subordination. And as this is more perfect and happy, we flourish and are blessed. The choice of the man then, and not of the mas∣ter, is voluntary. The man may be changed, but the Master is perpetual. He is created by our necessity, and we owe him the full obedience of our Love. In the duties of his office he is the soul of our institution; and while he lives in our reverence of him, we live also. To judge of that wisdom, we may employ in the choice, we must be sure of the <HI>character, object, manners, and form</HI> of Free Masonry.</P>
<P N="1">I. As the whole character of man is from education, under various names, so there are institutions to assist this education. They have various objects. They assist to devellope the faculties; to instruct in the arts; to form manners; to promote knowledge; to preserve
<PB N="8" REF="031799_0006_0FEE7294CC2F5E98"/>the affections; or to teach religion. They arise from private choice, or from the autho∣rity of Laws. They are adapted to private, or public ends. Some are designed to reform mankind, others to unite them. Some to find greater resources in human nature, and some to keep what we have already gotten. Some to separate the wise and good from the rest of mankind, and some to promote the general good. Our own is designed to bring all the social affections away from the cares of life; and the partialities of private friendship, into the service of our common nature. We pre∣fer no man's religion. We examine no laws of any country. We speak in no language: and take names from no party. We belong to every thing sincere and social in the hu∣man heart. We explore the imperfection of no character, which can be tolerated by the laws of any country. All men who have the heart to be social, and the power to be kind, we love. The gay we do not despise. The follies which violate no laws of life and manners, we forget. We mix our pleasures with every innocent gaiety of the song; and we become cheerful at the flowing bowl, and
<PB N="9" REF="031799_0007_0FEE729A054E94E0"/>the table. We take men as we find them, disposed to live in the happiness of each other. Such is the <HI>Character</HI> of Free Masonry.</P>
<P N="2">II. But to guard our institution from abuse, we have a generous object always before us. We chase away all envy, competition, and strife. We have our brethren every where in the family of mankind: we therefore des∣pise no customs, insult no laws, and hate no country. To know our brethren is our de∣light; to assist them is our glory. Our wealth, beyond our own wants, is sacred to their use. To point out the path of life, and make it happy, is our sublime wisdom. We cannot be friends of society, if we violate any of its laws. To be honourable among masons, we must have honour from every social obli∣gation. We have too great a share in the public happiness, to separate from it. We cannot be miserable, because every man's happiness is our own. Cheerful, we are sure to be content; and, as far as we are able, we provide for perpetual peace. Domestic life has its chief joys from our friendship; and industry its greatest guards from our love.
<PB N="10" REF="031799_0008_0FEE729B91168EB8"/>We know no man, but in his capacity for happiness; and we have no duty to him, but to enlarge it. Such is the <HI>object</HI> of our insti∣tution.</P>
<P N="3">III. We are not insensible of the liableness of our institution to abuse, and we know that the abuses of all institutions have a cha∣racter from the nature of them. How in∣estimable are the advantages of religion! Of living in the love of God! But how many fanatics and bigots, devotees and mystics, are recounted in the history of every religion. We furnish none of these; we shun them. But, while the passions live in our world in sad perversion, we dare not pretend, that our brethren have not been betrayed. We pre∣tend to nothing above human nature. We take propensities as we find them, and we aim to render them useful. We take the man in the gay hour, when his coun∣tenance is cheered by the congratulations of his friends; his spirits elevated by mirth, and the song; when fancy is sportive, and amuse∣ments are ready; and while he is exhilirated at the feast of joy. These are scenes from which the gay will not be excluded. They
<PB N="11" REF="031799_0009_0FEE729E5C46DC70"/>may be rendered the innocent pleasures of social life. They are not sought with equal delight in every place. The glass is never filled in the master's presence in some places, but at the festivals; and the song is seldom heard among some brethren, but in the jocund hour, when the Lodge is shut. These plea∣sures are indulgences, not Laws: of choice, not of obligation. And if we sometimes ex∣ceed the bounds, which decency and good manners appoint, it is not because we do not profess an abhorrence of every thing contrary to the purest laws of life. We lament what we cannot correct. And in a faithful master, we have the surest restraints upon our gayest pleasures. Our dangers are from the activity of our spirits, and from the unbounded effusi∣ons of a cheerful hour. Profusion waits upon the steps of jollity, and pleasure often des∣pises interest. A master watches over his Lodge: he commands, and he is always obeyed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>form</HI> of the institution can be known only to the brethren. There is no∣thing, which the most refined delicacy might not behold. The solemn addresses at initi∣ation
<PB N="12" REF="031799_0010_0FEE729FE9146738"/>are before the world. We publish our Constitutions, Regulations, Instructions, and general Laws; and even our freest mirth; and from these we may appeal to an impartial world, whether those are not good principles we profess. We justify the use of every rite, of every form and ceremony, which can aid the local prejudices of religion or virtue. And the discretion gives no offence. We trust that the scene of this day will strengthen the convictions, that there are no obligations unworthy of a good man, and that the pre∣sence of the wise would be a desireable bles∣sing to Free Masonry.</P>
<P>THE Symbols we display, have been vari∣ously interpreted. We publish them not for curiosity, but for ceremony. They are em∣ployed not for superstition, but for use. All constructions favourable to moral life are in∣dulged, rather to remove prejudices abroad, than to define their character within the Lodge. They are free for disquisition, while they contribute to no dissention. To avoid the charge of obscurity, we shall not enter upon any particular explanation. It is enough, that the scrutiny of an antiquarian may re∣port
<PB N="13" REF="031799_0011_0FEF288E7B8872B0"/>that they are the most early emblems of wisdom, and such as may be found among all antient nations. A Bryant might discover the symbols of Egypt, as an Hutcheson has of Pythagoras, as well as of the antient mystics. They betray to the scholar no proofs of modern times, for their invention is as old as science itself. They have been con∣founded with the emblems in the mysteries of Greece, and constantly traced to geometry and philosophy. A strong resemblance in the antient gems has forced itself upon the notice of the most cursory observer. It is enough, if they be faithful in communicating their de∣sign through the world.</P>
<P>FROM these remarks upon Free Masonry, it may be soon apparent, how much will de∣pend on the <HI>Lectures</HI> of a Lodge, and conse∣quently how much upon a faithful <HI>Master,</HI> and <HI>Wardens.</HI> It may then be expected that every brother, who assumes an office, by the consent of a Lodge, will sacredly attend to his charge. Every officer ought to be a calm, friendly, and benevolent man. An extensive
<PB N="14" REF="031799_0012_0FEF282244802920"/>knowledge of the brethren ought to be his de∣sire, but he certainly ought to know the charac∣ter and habits of all in his own Lodge. The difference between well governed Lodges, and all other Lodges, is the greatest to be imagin∣ed. Nothing should be suffered which can provoke, alarm, or excite prejudice. The of∣fice of Charity is to keep every such thing from a Lodge. Unless then the master can rise above the distinctions of sects in religion, while he has an established character in the public opinion; unless he is superior to par∣ties in the state; unless he can freely con∣verse with all the brethren, without regard to the competitions of private life; unless he can be indulgent to particular manners and tempers, to customs, with which he cannot comply, and to amusements, he cannot pre∣fer; he will never diffuse a generous joy around him. All hearts will not be united. All prejudices will be active. Cheerfulness will not lean on partial kindness; nor fel∣lowship sit with disgrace. Brethren will not suffer their charity to be degraded by their opinions, nor by their names.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="031799_0013_0FEF2823CADA3A90"/>
FOR voluntary associations, we require such men to hold offices, as can be punctual, active, and ready in all the services of their station: to whom the prosperity of the Lodge is the highest reward, and whose measure of duty, is not from what others have done, but from a disposition to do all the good in their pow∣er. Happy indeed will it be, if the domestic and social character of a Master be lovely in the world, and inspire confidence in his bene∣volence. After such a delineation of our character, our brethren in this vicinity will not doubt of the nature of our advice and charge in these solemnities.</P>
<P>LET me then say to our Brethren of WASHINGTON LODGE; In this social institu∣tion you have the indulgence of all the inno∣cent passions, and all the incentives of gene∣rous affections. You may unbend in social glee, catch the sweet sympathy of pleasure, and share it with fullness of soul. And while you rejoice in, you ought to urge a friendly zeal, and even an enthusiasm to defend, a friendship you thus honourably enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031799_0014_0FEF284228D9F648"/>
TO secure a mason's heart, he ought to have a sincere temper, and the habits of good will. Our friendship is not begun in disin∣terested love. We have an interest in each other. There is too little of this love in the world, not to induce doubts of the strength of it, in many who profess it. The little to be found, which resembles it, agrees too well with the nature of our habits, to be ac∣counted for, more easily, on any other prin∣ciples. Constancy, then, is a virtue of a flourishing Lodge. It is only while we keep near the Lodge, we are Masons.</P>
<P>MASONS, as brethren, ought to be careful to receive only those who appear <HI>good men and true.</HI> What we gain from prejudice, is not sure gain. To open our arms to the disgra∣ced or the discontented of any society, is to degrade ourselves and make the injured our enemies. This will give a triumph to their zeal, and justify their invectives. He that is not at peace with all the world, cannot be at peace with us. He that despises and vio∣lates any profession, will certainly dishonour us.</P>
<P><PB REF="031799_0015_0FEF2847B235D9F0"/>
MASONS ought not only to regard the cha∣racter of men, but their <HI>dispositions.</HI> An in-institution may be adapted to preserve virtue, which is not fit to create it. The man who profits so little from life, as to have no lovely virtues, will be a tax upon us. He who does not conform to the approved manners and laws of a country, wants the first principles of friendship, and must prove a disgrace to us.</P>
<P>MASONS ought also to confirm their inte∣rest in each other. As the social principle be∣comes more strong from the interest we have in each other, in our whole character, we must have the greatest interest in every thing dear to the brethren. He that in common life can despise the most whimsical thoughts of a brother, will never enjoy his affections. A good brother must learn to see without any contempt, the most strange opinions living in a good heart. A Lodge is not a place for de∣bate, or controversy. Political questions are unknown in it. Every thing belonging to a brother enjoys our charity.</P>
<P><PB REF="031799_0016_0FEF284B297AED50"/>
MASONS should determine the <HI>conversation</HI> of a Lodge. The conversation that seems to have no higher aim than to diffuse general pleasure, and ends in no ill natured reflecti∣ons, but leaves friends at parting in perfect good humour, tends more to make men love one another, do their duty in society, and love their Creator, than any we can adopt in such associations. Most of our duty lies in society, and most of our virtue in contribut∣ing to make men happy in themselves. A wise man will look around him, not to say an ill thing without danger, but to learn how to recommend the most useful thoughts he can utter. He will endeavour to please in the best manner with the least offence.</P>
<P>AND for our common interest let me say, after Lodges have received their charters, and have been instructed, if they do not assert an independence, they are too apt to enjoy it. They become too negligent of their <HI>represen∣tation,</HI> and of their <HI>communications in the</HI> GRAND LODGE. Excellent members, con∣fined to their lovely lodges, forget that we are a band of brethren, and owe each other the
<PB REF="031799_0017_0FEF28500EA9FB88"/>most free communications. Every brother ought to aspire after the honours of these or∣derly visits; and, next to our own business, ought to be an enquiry into the last quarterly communications. A mason would then find that he belonged to a society more extensive than of his own neighbourhood. He would thus have the progress of the order, in his own country at least, if not through the world, before him. In his private pleasures he would not forget the general prosperity. We have our respective orbs; but we revolve around a common center. And from its glo∣ry, we have life, health and fraternity.</P>
<P>IT should also be remembered, that <HI>the strength of Lodges is in their members.</HI> While Lodges are open to the visits of Brethren, great care should be shewn, that due honours are given to members of Lodges. Generous liberty does not permit a brother to make a free use of his privilege, while in no place he welcomes a regular summons. The Tem∣ple is not finished, and no brother ceases en∣tirely from labour, unless privileged by particu∣lar services. To be members, is to hold the ob∣ligation,
<PB N="20" REF="031799_0018_0FEF285649B4D530"/>which is indispensably necessary for the existence of our order.</P>
<P>IN <HI>expences,</HI> that method will be most hap∣py, which keeps the funds, the special cha∣rities, the current charges, and the entertain∣ments, most distinct. The last ought to fall upon those who enjoy them. They are, therefore, better out of the Lodge than in it, for <HI>moral,</HI> as well as <HI>economical</HI> reasons.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>admission</HI> of <HI>members,</HI> regard ought to be paid to merit, in the kindest exempti∣ons from expence when the persons of merit cannot well support it. Such men would bring a character with them, and establish it in a Lodge. It would then be free from cen∣sure, and adorned with all the virtues of the best of men.</P>
<P>AND as we hold sacred the confidence of domestic life, our pleasures should never in∣croach upon the hours devoted to retirement, and to our homes.</P>
<P>IN qualifying ourselves to fill the Offices with such virtues, we rise in the public es∣teem,
<PB N="21" REF="031799_0019_0FEF287F0B4ACEE0"/>and enjoy the benevolent end of our institution. Our habits become as favourable to the best services in our power towards our brethren, as our hearts become free for the enjoyment of our social glee; and neither our interest in the world, nor our good habits suf∣fer from our lovely association.</P>
<P>LET us then cultivate the true temper of Free Masonry, and let us adorn the character with its commendable virtues. Then in hap∣py time we may adorn a master's station, and we shall always possess the merit, which would justify the appointment.</P>
<P>BELIEVE me, when I say, that as I love the principles of the Order, and have seen their benefit, so I sincerely desire to see the order respectable.</P>

<HEAD>A Salutatory Address.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>RESPECTED HEARERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have assembled together, at this time, to countenance an institution which serves to extend the principles of <HI>Concord</HI> and of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and to render man amiable and friendly to man.</P>
<P>WHILE in other nations are heard the cla∣mouring tumults of <HI>Discord,</HI> and the piteous groans of <HI>War,</HI> we are allowed under the mild auspices of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> to culti∣vate those arts and encourage those instituti∣ons, which harmonize the passions and perfect the virtues of individuals, which embellish the state of general society, and bind together in the same amities and interests the whole
<PB N="4" REF="031799_0022_0FEF288CF5EDB9A0"/>family of mankind.—To revive and expand these noble principles, is an object dear to every human being in whose heart flows cheerily "the milk of human kindness:" and to the venerable order of FREE and ACCEPTED MASONS has been an endeavour, strenuous as their most active abilities,—and a desire, warm and animated as any Philanthropy ever formed.</P>
<P>WHILE this day affords an opportunity of expressing our united attachment to the grand principles of humanity, let it prove a new motive to strengthen the endearing ligature which binds congenial hearts.—To my valued Brethren of WASHINGTON LODGE, the pre∣sent occasion is replete with <HI>interesting, im∣portant,</HI> and <HI>joyous</HI> circumstances. It is the <HI>birth-day</HI> of their privileges; and they are now to receive the sanction of establishment, and the solemnity of consecration. Cheerfully do I do mingle my felicitations with theirs.</P>
<P>IT is truly pleasing to see these Colonies of the friends of <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> spread∣ing themselves around. It is a renewed evi∣dence of the acknowledged importance, and increased reputation of our excellent society.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="031799_0023_0FEF2820B94F2098"/>
<P><HI>Right Worshipful</HI> MASTER, <HI>Respected</HI> OFFI∣CERS, <HI>and beloved</HI> BRETHREN of WASHING∣TON LODGE! with all the sincerity of frater∣nal affection does my heart proffer you its best wishes. Nor need I extend the desires of cordial regard, for your united and individual prosperity, farther than this comprehensive hope, that, as you have adopted the <HI>name</HI> of our MOST RENOWNED BROTHER for the re∣commendatory title of your Lodge, you may adopt his <HI>virtues</HI> for the recommendatory or∣nament of your lives!—May the Lodge now consecrated, be conspicuous for its clear <HI>light,</HI> and long honored in its enlarging sphere of <HI>usefulness</HI> and <HI>glory!</HI></P>
<P>AND surely these congratulations and wishes are reciprocated by every friend to the social interests and happiness of mankind. Especially when they are daily more and more convinced, that the <HI>light</HI> in which we rejoice, is not the mimic blaze which glitters o'er the train of folly, but the steady lustre reflected, from those resplendent luminaries of the Masonic hemisphere, WISDOM, TRUTH, and VIRTUE.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031799_0024_0FEF289068691F90"/>
LET it be remembered, that on the firm basis of general <HI>Philanthropy</HI> are erected the pillars of our institution, modelled to a perfec∣tion which no art can excel, no marble out∣live. While we admire the noble structure of the edifice, we receive the most pleasing satis∣faction and instruction in perusing those hea∣venly documents which compose its arcana. We are there taught the most solid truths, important and interesting to the welfare of mankind. Directed by the grand principles there delineated, we approach nearer the divine plan of the SOVEREIGN ARCHITECT; and becoming perfect masons, are rendered wiser and better members of society. In the calm moments of reflection, when divested of the impressions of prejudice, the world will approve the principles which animate us; since it is their glory to call forth into action the most benevolent and noble feelings of the heart. The salutary institutes of our Craft are happily calculated to produce the greatest comfort to individuals and to augment the happiness of society, by teaching us to be∣come temperate, just, benevolent and pious; and by directing the natural propensities of the human soul, the love of pleasure and the
<PB N="7" REF="031799_0025_0FEF2899C411F630"/>love of action, to their noblest ends. Those qualities of the mind, which are thus excited and exercised, tend immediately to refine our feelings and dignify our natures. And over the scenes both of retired and public life, their benign influence sheds a mild and pleasing lustre. The combined effect is allow∣edly conducive to the amelioration of man∣ners, and the improvement of social bliss.</P>
<P>So long as our race shall be subject to infir∣mity and exposed to misfortune, <HI>friendly hu∣manity</HI> will be deemed a virtue and a blessing; and so long as individuals can derive advan∣tage or pleasure from reciprocal interest and attachment, the credit of this fraternity must increase, and Masonry continue to deserve universal approbation.</P>
<P>AT the same time that the instructions and operations of the Lodge assist in giving to the intellectual and moral faculties the <HI>Wisdom, Strength,</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> which accomplish their perfection; they industriously <HI>contrive</HI> and generously <HI>support</HI> those ingenious discoveries and useful arts which correct <HI>taste</HI> and em∣bellish <HI>life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="031799_0026_0FEF28A0DB2BAC58"/>
GREAT are our obligations to those venera∣ble characters in whom first dawned the light of Masonry; the united and increasing radiance of which, diffusing itself over remotest climes, has been continually dispelling the noxious vapors of gloomy superstition and the gathering clouds of threatening envy. And we rejoice in those energetic exertions which have successfully contributed to form a socie∣ty, and bring into complete operation an establishment, whose only aim is that of unit∣ing, in the same softened and virtuous affecti∣ons, the whole human race.</P>
<P>LET no breast, then, harbor sentiments incompatible with the liberal principles on which our association is founded: since it must be perverseness to deny its merited honors to a Society which has risen superior, in every age, to partiality and prejudice; and, by the testimony of its effects, silenced objection and conciliated esteem.—</P>
<P>THE flowers of fancy and the figures of eloquence would be vainly lavished in its praise. Sufficiently attractive to your eyes is the unadorned portrait. The pencil of <HI>Truth</HI> has sketched the outline, and given</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="031799_0027_0FEF28A540ECA9F0"/>
IN conclusion, my Brethren will permit me to observe, that, as we aspire to the praise of <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> so we pro∣fess ourselves the admirers of BEAUTY, natu∣ral as well as intellectual and moral. They will expect me, therefore, to notice our FAIR FRIENDS, whose presence honors and whose smiles enliven us. We owe them a tribute of warmest thanks for gracing our public assembly.</P>
<P>IT is to be regretted that institutions in general have excluded that lovely sex from becoming members. We disclaim the idea of their being unequal to any important trust or inadequate to the best purposes of society. Were they to mingle more inti∣mately with <HI>social,</HI> or more actively with <HI>political</HI> institutions, much might be expect∣ed from their polished talents and beautiful designs. If it be asked why they are not permitted to join with us, in extending the interests of humanity, and in cultivating and improving the friendly virtues; we would reply, that, their charms and attractions, which so decorate the scenery of life, would become incompatible with the labors of the Lodge; that <HI>Love, powerful Love,</HI> might so
<PB N="10" REF="031799_0028_0FEF28ABCCFBCAA0"/>influence and triumph, that <HI>Brotherly Affec∣tion</HI> would give way to Jealousy, Friendship to Dissimulation, and Judgment to Passion. In the important business of our retirement, the presence of the Fair would so intermingle a train of busy loves, as to banish every other sentiment; and make us inattentive to every care and forgetful of every duty which forms the object and the recommendation of our es∣tablishment.—Admit, ye lovely partners of our hearts and hopes, our honest apology: and be assured that the <HI>fidelity</HI> which is inscribed upon the Mason's breast, will give certainty to the Lover's promise, and permanency to the Husband's affection; will render us all more worthy of your regards, and more auxi∣liary to your happiness.—</P>
<P><HI>BROTHERS,</HI></P>
<P>RECOLLECT that a strict observance of the rules of our duty will ever secure us from censure and reproach. While by our con∣duct we give no latitude for malicious insinu∣ations, the purity of our intentions, what∣ever the uncandid may think of them, will not fail to give to our own hearts a confidence which will support and cheer in every scene, and brighten the evening shades of mortal existence.</P>
