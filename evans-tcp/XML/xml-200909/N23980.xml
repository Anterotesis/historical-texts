<HEAD>THE AMERICAN FARMER's GUIDE.</HEAD>
<P>THE success of Farming depends principally on the collecting manure—on a proper change of crops, and on good tillage or plough∣ing the ground properly to keep it clean; on the choice and manage∣ment of stock, and on the care of the orchard and its produce. On these several articles I shall make some notes, which are chiefly col∣lected from Mr. Young's Farmer's tour through England, published in 1771.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="4" REF="031718_0003_0FEE1A4ADE4DFAF8"/>
<HEAD>Means for collecting manure, and ma∣nagement of a farm-yard.</HEAD>
<P>Let the farm-yard be made tole∣bly large, around it let there be sheds or shelter for cattle. The yard should be level, or rather hollow in the middle, that the ooze may not run off. Into this yard throw all your straw, which is not used for bedding. But as this will not be sufficient, it will be well to mow stubble, which is cut high, and cart it in the yard. All the rubbish and weeds in the lanes, &amp;c. which should be cut while green before they go to seed, should likewise be carted in. But above all, rake together the leaves in the woods, which may be loaded into carts with large bas∣kets, and carry them into the yard. These being spread over the yard, will by the cattle's treading on them, and receiving their dung and urine all winter, be converted in∣to as rich a manure as any in the world.</P>
<P>When cattle are housed, they should be bedded every night with
<PB N="5" REF="031718_0004_0FEE1A4E3A2BAD88"/>straw or leaves up to their bellies. This contributes to their health and encreases the dung. Let their stall be cleansed out once a week, The heat of their bodies lying on the litter for that time will begin to promote a fermentation, by which it will be reduced to a good manure. By this mean, for every horse or cow kept in a stable during the winter, you may make at least fif∣teen or sixteen large loads of dung. This dung should, in the spring, be carted out to a stercorary, which should be prepared in the following manner: First, spread a layer of earth (the cleansing of ditches or earth scraped from the surface of the ground will answer for this) then throw on a thick layer of dung, and then a layer of earth, and so alternately a layer of dung and a layer of earth, but so that the quantity of earth shall not ex∣ceed one half the quantity of dung. By this mean you will have 23 or 24 loads of good manure for every beast, and this laid on in the fall will be a good dressing for an acre of land.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031718_0005_0FEE1A519CBF6BB8"/>
In making the stercorary, the carts should not drive on the heap, as this would press it too much and pre∣vent the fermentation, which is necessary to render it good compost. The loads may be shot down by the heap and thrown on with shovels, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Great care should be taken to pre∣serve the urine and ooze from the yard and stercorary. For this pur∣pose some careful farmers sink wells, the bottom and sides of which are well clayed. To these the ooze is conducted, and when they are full, some pump it up and throw it back upon the heap; others cart it out and sprinkle it over the grass. This last is said to be an excellent prac∣tice.</P>
<P>There is another practice which turns to great account, as well for increasing the quantity of manure as for feeding horses and cattle in the cheapest manner; let a field of red clover be sowed near the farm∣yard; in the second year after it is sown it will be fit for cutting in the second week in May. Let the hor∣ses
<PB N="7" REF="031718_0006_0FEE1A5549BC4388"/>and cattle be then kept in the yard, and clover cut and given to them in the stable or in racks. It has been found by experience that 7 acres of clover will feed 20 hor∣ses, 7 cows, 5 calves, and as many pigs, for 17 weeks. Suppose the rate of keeping to be as follows:

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>It will be necessary here to observe, that this calculation is made in Pennsylvania, where the prices and currency may differ materially from those of other places; the reader must therefore make his calculation according to the customs by which he is most liable to be regulated.</HI></NOTE> Be∣sides this, the quantity of dung is immense where there is litter at command; and this is always the case where leaves can be gathered
<PB N="8" REF="031718_0007_0FEE1A58E10381F0"/>from the woods; for cattle fed on green food make much more urine in the summer. It has been esti∣mated that four or five hundred loads of good dung may be made in the time mentioned from the above horses and cattle. This, mixed with earth as before directed, will produce upwards of 600 loads of manure, which would be a pretty good dressing for thirty acres of land.</P>
<P>It is to be observed that a careful farmer suffers nothing to go to waste; and therefore all the urine and of∣fals from the house, and all the or∣dure from the necessary are carried and thrown on the stercorary or farm-yard.</P>
<P>In preparing a place for the ster∣corery, it may not be amiss first to dig out the earth about two or three feet deep. In that case the bottom should be well rammed and clayed, to prevent the ooze from sinking into the earth. The earth that is dug out, if of a loomy quality or sandy mixed with loom, will serve to mix with the dung; so that the
<PB N="9" REF="031718_0008_0FEE1A5A6BA5A908"/>labour of digging the pit will not be lost.</P>
<P>In order to mix the earth and dung well together, the stercorary should be turned at least once in the summer. For this purpose a small space should be left at one end, then beginning at that end throw an e∣qual space of the compost from top to bottom into that empty space, and so proceed till the whole is well turned and mixed. The ster∣corary should be kept moist, but not too wet; for though a moderate degree of moisture promotes fer∣mentation and putrefaction, too great a degree will prevent them. As our summer sun is very warm, and exhales too much of the moist∣ure, it will be well to cover the stercorary with hurdles or leavy branches, or a thatched cover may be made over it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>2 <HI>The change and course of crops.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It is a common opinion and prac∣tice in this country, that land should yield a crop only once in three
<PB N="10" REF="031718_0009_0FEE1A61B2700878"/>years: this surely is bad farming, and what nothing but the great quantity of land could warrant. In England and throughout Europe, and indeed in all old settled coun∣tries, where land is scarce and rents high, it is absolutely necessary that a crop of some sort be raised from the ground every year. And expe∣rience has evinced that land will bear this, and that the goodness of the crop depends upon culture and manure, and a proper change of seeds. For though good lands are of great importance, yet the skill and industry of the farmer, will, in a great degree, compensate for the want of goodness in the soil in its natural state; and it is found that by proper management, lands which are naturally poor have been bro't to yield crops nearly as great as rich lands, and much greater than rich lands ill managed. The man therefore to whose lot it has fallen to possess lands naturally poor should not be discouraged, but rather stim∣ulated to exert his abilities and shew his skill in meliorating nature.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031718_0010_0FEE1A6340554BF0"/>
A succession of the same fort of crops will speedily exhaust the best land. For this reason the skilful farmer changes his crops almost e∣very year. The succession most approved, and which is practised to great advantage in Norfolk, one of the best farming counties in Eng∣land, is;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Turnips,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Barley with clover seed,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Clover,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 Wheat;</ITEM>
</LIST> Then turnips, &amp;c. in succession a∣gain. Some have had the third and fourth year clover, and the fifth wheat.</P>
<P>Another course, which they find extremely beneficial, is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Turnips,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Barley,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Clover, two years,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 Buckwheat,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 Wheat; then turnips, &amp;c. a∣gain.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>They plough four or five times for turnips, beginning in the fall. After the second ploughing they leave the ground unharrowed to
<PB N="12" REF="031718_0011_0FEE1A64C9A95BB0"/>receive the benefit of the winter frosts. They plough it again in the spring, having first laid on the ma∣nure; then they plough and harrow it again in May, and give it the last ploughing and harrowing in June, when the seed is sown.</P>
<P>Some put on their manure just before the last ploughing. With respect to this experience will be the best director. The turnips should be sown in rows, or the seed drilled with a drill plough. The turnips, while growing, should be hoed twice, or ploughed between the rows, as it is common for pota∣toes, and kept clear of weeds.</P>
<P>The crop is fed off with cattle and sheep. Some feed them off as they grow, confining the cattle and sheep by hurdles to an acre, and when that is eaten up, removing the hurdles, and taking in another acre till the whole is fed off. O∣thers pursue the following method: they first feed one piece, suppose an acre, by running a row of hurdles across the field; then, before they move the hurdles, they draw ano∣ther
<PB N="13" REF="031718_0012_0FEE1A6BD36587C8"/>acre, and cart them for the cattle to the acre eating off, and so on through the field, always cart the crop from the land where it grows to the part last cleared. If the produce is large, and cattle turned in, they spoil as much as they eat, but when turnips are laid clear above the soil, and the earth partly shaken off, they eat them up clean.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A method practised to destroy the turnip fly.</HEAD>
<P>Collect all sorts of weeds, mix them with straw, and lay them in heaps on the windward side of the field. Then set them on sire, so that the wind may blow the smoke over the whole field. This drives away the fly at once and saves the crop. But it should be observed that the weeds must not be wither∣ed too much, as it is the smother∣ing flame that produces the smoke, which is expected to have the desi∣red effect.</P>
<P>For barley they commonly plow
<PB N="14" REF="031718_0013_0FEE1A6D5B732150"/>three times, but some four times, twice in the fall, leaving the last ploughing unharrowed to receive the benefit of the winter frosts, the other ploughing or ploughings they give in the winter or spring. With us, as our winters are generally se∣vere, three, or even two ploughings will do; one or two in the fall &amp; one in the spring. They sow four bushels of seed to the acre, and get from thirty-two to forty bushels in return. This seems a large quan∣tity of seed. However, experience will shew, whether the quantity commonly sown in this country, which is usually not more than two bushels, or that sown in Norfolk is best. And for this purpose, it will be well to try different quantities on the same field, and note the dif∣ference, and then follow that which answers best.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Clover.</HEAD>
<P>After the barley is sown and har∣rowed, they then sow the clover seed, eight or ten pounds of seed to
<PB N="15" REF="031718_0014_0FEE1A6EE584EB60"/>the acre, and then roll the ground with a large wooden roller, which presses in the seed and breaks the clods. In this country some defer sowing the clover till the barley is off. The land is then ploughed and well harrowed, and sown with clover seed, eight or ten pounds to the acre, and then rolled. Some recommend the sowing buckwheat before the last harrowing, and then to sow and roll in the clover seed. The buckwheat, they observe, shel∣ters the young clover from the sun, and keeps down weeds and other grass. But in this case the buck∣wheat should be sown very thin. The mowing or cutting it in the fall will not injure the clover. Both ways may be tried.</P>
<P>The year following they mow the first crop of clover, and feed the second. The crop of hay is gene∣rally two tons to an acre, sometimes three. I am inclined to think it will be best to mow both crops, and if feed is wanting for the cattle in the beginning of summer, it would be best to cut it, and give it them
<PB N="16" REF="031718_0015_0FEE1A706EE74748"/>green in the farm yard or stables, as before mentioned. If the after crop is rank, it may be fed in the fall; and if it is kept for a clover crop the next year, it should be co∣vered in the beginning of the win∣ter with a light coat of long dung, about ten or twelve large loads to the acre, to preserve the roots from the frost. The next year, some mow twice, some only once, and turn in the second crop as a manure for wheat.</P>
<P>Clover should be cut for hay be∣fore the seed is ripe, just when it seems to be in full blossom; and in making the hay great care should be taken not to expose it too much to the sun.</P>
<P>In curing clover, it is recom∣mended by some as the best way to let it lay a short time in the swarth, then just turn over the swarths, and thus backwards and forwards, with∣out exposing it long at any time to the sun, and without spreading it abroad, by which means the leaves will be welted and adhere firmly to the stalk; whereas, by exposing them to the warm sun, the leaves
<PB N="17" REF="031718_0016_0FEE1A793A7FB928"/>are shrivelled and drop from the stalk, and thereby the richest part is lost.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Hay-making.</HEAD>
<P>In answer to some enquiries I made of Col. G. M. respecting his prac∣tice of making hay, I received the following letter: "I make a point of mowing only when the weather promises, with a degree of certain∣ty, it will be fair, afternoon gusts excepted, which, in our climate, cannot be guarded against only by my process. I then set my mowers at work as soon as I can get them at it. They continue to cut until ten o'clock. At nine o'clock I turn my horses and cattle out of the ploughs, and after the ploughmen have taken their breakfast, I set them and the mowers to raking my grass from the swarth into winrows, beginning at the grass last cut, and proceeding on until they have ga∣thered into winrows all the swarths which were cut the preceding part of the day. These winrows are
<PB N="18" REF="031718_0017_0FEE1A7AC7B56768"/>then made into what we call grass∣cocks. This being done, the mow∣ers proceed in cutting, and the ra∣kers follow and gather and cock af∣ter them as fast as they cut until night. When I do not choose to take my ploughmen off, and have not other hands, my mowers cut till 11 o'clock, by which time each has cut an acre or more. The mow∣ers then proceed to rake and cock, beginning with the grass last cut, and finishing with that first mow∣ed in the morning. If I see clouds arise in the afternoon, I dispatch hands sufficient to assist and get all into cock before the rain comes on. When it continues fair all day, a mower can cut about as much grass by eleven or twelve o'clock, as he can conveniently rake and cock be∣fore sun-set. Thus my mowing and making my hay costs me about 5<ABBR>s.</ABBR> or 5.<ABBR>s</ABBR> 6. per. acre; for that is the price I give per day to a good workman, who finds himself in vic∣tuals and liquor, and who will ne∣ver cut less than an acre by eleven o'clock, provided he is not to con∣tinue it the succeeding part of the
<PB N="19" REF="031718_0018_0FEE1A7C50F297B0"/>day. I say the mowing, making, and cocking cost me 5<ABBR>s.</ABBR> or 5<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> per acre, because I never open these cocks till I house or stack my hay; for if even repeated and continual rains should fall, while it is in cock, the water never penetrates farther than the sun or wind will immedi∣ately dry. This mode of making hay preserves it (all except the out∣er side of each blade exposed to the sun) of a green colour, and prevents the evaporation of the rich juices of the grass, which are preserved in the highest perfection. I have practised this method six successive seasons with my common meadow grass, and having fallen into the very beneficial practice of sowing twenty acres of clover every year, I have cured all my clover hay in this method; and you may depend upon it to be the best as well as the cheapest. All the caution necessa∣ry to be used in this manner of ma∣king hay is, that the grass be dry when first put into cock; by this I mean dry from dew or rain. In the usual manner of making clover into hay, the leaves become of a
<PB N="20" REF="031718_0019_0FED37DE3B8AFF08"/>dark tobacco colour, and part from the stalks on the very slightest touch, so that you house very few of them. But by this method the whole are preserved of an olive green, and the stalks are soft and pliable and contain great nutriment. In regard to the time your hay must continue out in cocks before it be housed, that must depend on the weather, and your judgment of its state. Having no fear of its being injured by continuing too long in the field, I leave mine out from one to three weeks, never hurrying my∣self from other necessary work at this busy season.</P>
<P>Some put up their clover when it seems to be but half cured, but to preserve it from heating in the mow they use this precaution: they have a quantity of straw ready pre∣pared; they then first lay down a layer of straw, and a layer of hay upon that, and so alternately: Some use a farther precaution: When they put up their hay in barracks, they leave a space at the bottom be∣tween the ground and the hay:
<PB N="21" REF="031718_0020_0FEE1A86B9D75B98"/>they have then bags filled with hay, one or more, as they judge necessa∣ry, according to the largeness of the barrack and the state of the grass. These bags they set up an end on the floor, and then throw in the hay and straw alternately as above, treading them down and drawing up the bags as the rick ri∣ses, and thus vent holes are made for the air to pass through the mid∣dle of the hay from bottom to top, which cools it and prevents it from heating. By these means the dry straw soaks up the superfluous moisture of the hay, and becomes so impregnated with the juices of the clover, that the whole is eaten up clean by both horses and cattle. This practice of intermixing straw with clover is recommended on an∣other account: The mixture of straw prevents the bad effects of clover, which, when eaten by itself is apt to hove cattle. And it is worthy of observation, that when cattle are fed in a yard, if there are racks of straw therein, as well as clover, the cattle will of their own
<PB N="22" REF="031718_0021_0FEE1A8846A0E258"/>accord go from the clover to the straw, and then to the clover, and so backwards and forwards alternately. And hence it appears to be proper, if straw be not mixed with clover in the rick, that a portion of it should be given to the cattle along with the clo∣ver.</P>
<P>If the second crop of clover is ploughed in, it will answer as a ma∣nure for wheat; but if the second crop is cut, then it will be proper to lay on a coat of compost from the ster∣corary, from ten to twenty large loads to an acre, as you have it to spare. Plough it in, and sow the wheat. Some harrow the ground, sow the wheat, and plough it in; others sow, and har∣row in the seed; and in harrowing, some cross harrow, and divide the field into ridges by a furrow drawn with a plough; others harrow with the furrows, which throws the seed into rows and makes the field appear as if it was sown with a drill plough; others plough and harrow the ground, and then drill in the seed with what is called the drill harrow, which drops the seed, and at the same time covers
<PB N="23" REF="031718_0022_0FEE1A89CEFF14B0"/>it, and is made with such a number of drills, that with it one man can sow five or six acres a day or more. This last I take to be the best method; but experience will direct in this as well as the quantity of seed to be sown; for which purpose, it will be well to try different methods in the same field, and note the difference.</P>
<P>After the wheat is reaped, it is a common practice with the Norfolk farmers to harrow the stubble and cart it home to the farm yard. If the wheat be cradled there will be less stubble left on the field; but still it will be worth while to harrow and cart home what can be collected. Af∣ter this they proceed in the culture of the land for turnips next year, and in the succession of crops, as above men∣tioned, without ever suffering the land to lie idle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Indian Corn.</HEAD>
<P>As the culture of turnips is not com∣mon, at least to such a degree in this country as in England, I am inclined to think Indian corn may be substitut∣ed
<PB N="24" REF="031718_0023_0FEE1A8B57E91800"/>to good advantage in place of tur∣nips; and as we have not yet found marle for manuring our lands, though I have no doubt there is plenty of it if sought for, but till it be found, lime, where it can be got conveniently, may be used instead of marle. In this cul∣ture I would recommend the plough∣ing up the field in the fall. Then lay on about forty bushels of unslack∣ed lime fresh from the kiln to every acre. Various methods are used in laying on the lime: some put it in heaps, and when it is slacked, they mix it with earth, and cart out the mixture and spread it over the land. Some shoot down a load of forty bush∣els on each acre, there let it slack, mix it when slacked with some earth, and carry it out and spread it over the ground. Others divide the load into small heaps on the ground, and as soon as it slacks, spread it with a shovel without any mixture of earth, taking care to scrape up the ground under the heap. They then harrow the ground to mix and cover the lime: which of these methods is best I cannot deter∣mine, not having had sufficient expe∣rience.
<PB N="25" REF="031718_0024_0FEE1A9445B2C938"/>Different experiments may be made, which is the only mode of acquiring knowledge in this business.</P>
<P>In the spring, plough and harrow the ground, and when it is time to plant, furrow out the ground, crossing it at right angels with deep furrows for planting: the furrows should be strait and equidistant. The breadth of the intervals between the furrows or rows, will depend upon the good∣ness of the soil. When the ground is furrowed out, drop two or three grains at every intersection of the fur∣rows, and cover them with a hoe. If a shovel full of good dung is mixed with earth and put into each intersec∣tion where the corn is planted, the goodness of the crop would largely pay the expence. Then plough and harrow it as usual till the corn begins to tassel, always keeping the ground loose, and clear from weeds and grass. But after it tassels, and the silk begins to appear, it should be left to itself. Meddling with it at that time is hurt∣ful. And if it has had a good fall and spring ploughing, been limed and well tended till that time, the weeds after∣wards
<PB N="26" REF="031718_0025_0FEE1A95CF37DFC0"/>will not come to any great height, at least not to injure the crop. When the corn is ripe, plough the ground down from the rows into the furrows or middle, leaving the corn standing to dry, the blades of the stalks being stripped off, and the tops cut and carried home. After the corn is pulled, the stalks may be cut down and the ridge ploughed up. And thus the ground may be left the ensuing winter either for barley or clover seed, or for potatoes, which is a crop that deserves the attention of the farmer, either for the market or for feeding.</P>
<P>There is another method of prepa∣ring the ground for planting Indian corn, which I am inclined to prefer to that just mentioned. It is to be ob∣served that corn does not strike a deep root, but draws its nutriment from the upper coat of earth. For this cause it is common to make hills with hoes round the root of the stalks, but as this requires much labour, I would recommend the ploughing the land in the spring, into ridges of the width of the intended intervals between the rows, making the first furrow pretty
<PB N="27" REF="031718_0026_0FEE1A97584151F0"/>deep; then cross the ridges with a deep surrow, and at the intersection of the ridge and cross furrows, plant the seed, and as the corn springs up, plow down the ridges into the fur∣rows, and harrow the ground to keep it clear of weeds. By this method the corn will have plenty of rich loose mould for supplying it with nourish∣ment without much trouble of hoeing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Potatoes.</HEAD>
<P>If potatoes are fixed on to follow the corn, I would recommend plough∣ing the ground in April, pretty deep, into ridges of three and an half feet wide. Dung the furrow with about 14 or 15 loads of yard dung to an acre; then plant the potatoes on the dung, one row in a furrow, and one foot asunder. Some recommend the lay∣ing the potatoes on the earth, aad the dung over them, and as the beginning of our summers are usually dry and warm, I am inclined to believe this is the best method. However, in this, as has been already observed, experi∣ence will be the best guide. Then
<PB N="28" REF="031718_0027_0FEE1A9E5DC98CA0"/>cover them with a plough from each fide. When the shoots appear a few inches above the ground, plough down the land to them, and repeat the ploughing till the center of the ridges becomes a furrow. Some, after this, give them one hand hoeing, drawing up the earth close to the stalks; but this is condemned by others, who say that the centre of the ridge should be kept low to retain the moisture and rain, and prevent its running off. If in ploughing between the rows, a plough was used with a double mould∣board, to throw the earth on both sides, the furrow in the middle might be sunk deeper, and the earth thrown up to the stalks without injuring the roots. In October they are dug up with prongs. This operation may be ren∣dered easy by cutting down the ridg∣es on both sides into the furrows with a plough.</P>
<P>When the potatoes are gathered they should be spread to dry, and when dry, then stored away till they be car∣ried to market or used at home. They are found to be an excellent food for cattle and hogs; cows will eat them
<PB N="29" REF="031718_0028_0FEE1A9FE56161B8"/>raw greedily; hogs will fatten well on them boiled and marshed with a little barley meal or Indian corn meal mix∣ed. In England they are estimated to be worth 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> a bushel for feed∣ing cattle; and by the culture above mentioned, an acre of land will pro∣duce upwards of one hundred bushels, and of some forts two hundred bush∣els. The time for planting is the end of April, but they will do in May, or even the first week in June. Next spring sow barley or clover seed as before mentioned, first giving the ground one good ploughing, then sow∣ing the barley and rolling in the clo∣ver seed as before directed. As your ground will now be in good heart, you may get a tolerable crop of clover that season after the barley: but then in December, when the ground is fro∣zen, and before the snow falls, you should lay on about ten loads an acre of yard dung. The clover may re∣main two years, then follow it wtth wheat on one ploughing.</P>
<P>After this, some let the land lie sal∣low one year; but if this be adopted, it will be best to plough in the stub∣ble,
<PB N="30" REF="031718_0029_0FEE1AA16E7B0C40"/>and sow early in the spring about one half the usual quantity of rye. This will afford fine pasture in the spring and summer. Some sow clover seed with the wheat, and this is found to answer well, as it furnishes good fat pasture after the wheat is reaped, as well as rich pasture the summer fol∣lowing. This is a mode practised by the German farmers in Pennsylvania, and is found very advantageous.</P>
<P>If the trouble and labour required for raising two spring crops the same season, which must be the case provi∣ded potatoes be adopted as one of the rotine or course crops, be thought too much, corn and potatoes together, I mean a certain number of acres for each, may be made one course.</P>
<P>I have not mentioned oats, because in this country it is a contemptible crop, and scarce worth raising; barley being far better even for the feed of horses.</P>
<P>A farm with one hundred acres of of clear land, besides what is necessary for the kitchen garden and barn yard, if disposed agreeably to the above di∣rections, will every year afford the

<P>In case of leaving a field every year fallow, it might be well to sow clover seed with the wheat, which will afford most excellent pasture after the wheat harvest, and in the spring following the field may be ploughed, and about the first of June sowed with buckwheat, which will destroy the weeds that grow up after the wheat, and prepare the ground for Indian corn and pota∣toes the year following. Buck∣wheat is a meliorating crop, and if it sueceeds, is, in my opinion, equal, if not superior to oats. In this mode then there will be

<HEAD>Oats.</HEAD>
<P>If at all adventures oats must be raised, I would recommend a prac∣tice, which, I am told, has been fol∣lowed by some farmers to advan∣tage: They choose out a piece of ground, no matter though of indif∣ferent quality, so it be convenient to the house; they first plough it up in the fall, and lime it with about forty bushels of unslacked lime to the acre; in the spring, they plough it again and sow it with oats: as soon as the oats are cut and gather∣ed in, they plough in the stubble, harrow the ground and shut up the field. The oats scattered in reaping or cradling spring up and yield a good fall pasture for milch cows. Next spring it is sown again with oats, and treated in the same man∣ner, and so from year to year. I was told by a farmer that he had sixteen crops of oats successively
<PB N="34" REF="031718_0033_0FEE1AAF0F0EA510"/>year after year from the same field, treated in this way, and that the land, from being very poor, became so rich, that he was obliged to change the crop and sow barley. I will not vouch for the truth of this, but it may be worth trying.</P>
<P>Though crops of corn and pota∣toes, barley, clover and wheat, may be considered as the staple articles in farming, yet there are other ar∣ticles of produce that deserve the attention of a farmer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Pumpkins.</HEAD>
<P>Pumpkins is one of these: For raising a crop of pumpkins, chuse a piece of ground near the farm∣yard; a light loomy soil answers best; plough it up in the fall, then cross plough and harrow it in the spring; furrow it out into squares of ten feet each, and provide a quan∣tity of well rotten dung, and parti∣cularly hogs dung in preference to any other.</P>
<P>In the last week of May dig holes at the intersections of the furrows,
<PB N="35" REF="031718_0034_0FEE1AB26796D3A0"/>and throw into each two or three shovels full of dung, mixing it well with a parcle of the mould dug out of the holes. About the 10th of June, mix again the dung and mould in the holes and plant the seed. The yellow fleshed round pump∣kins or the flat ribbed sort are reck∣oned the best. After the seed is planted, plough up the ground be∣tween and harrow it; and while the plants are growing, plough and harrow the ground as often as is ne∣cessary to keep it loose and clear of weeds, always hand-hoeing round the plants. It is the practice of some to make up hills and plant the seed in the hills: this may be pro∣per in England, from whence I pre∣sume the practice has been brought, where the summer sun is weak and faint; but it is certainly improper in this country under our scorching suns, and where the summers are commonly dry; and therefore the holes, when the dung and mould are mixed in them for planting should be somewhat lower than the surface of the adjoining ground.
<PB N="36" REF="031718_0035_0FEE1AB9730032B8"/>About six or seven seeds should be planted in each hole; but when the the plants are up and out of danger from flies or insects, then the weak∣est should be plucked up, and only three of the most vigourous plants left in each hole. When the pump∣kins are ripe, gather them into heaps, laying them on a thick bed of straw, and cover the heaps well with straw to guard them from frost. They are an excellent food both for cattle and hogs. They are to be broken or chopped into pieces and given to the cattle in troughs, or thrown upon clean grass. Seve∣ral farmers have fattened both hogs and cattle entirely with them. The produce is immense; it is calculat∣ed that an acre of ground may pro∣duce upwards of twenty tons. The same piece of ground may be used in succession for any number of years.</P>

<HEAD>Cabbage.</HEAD>
<P>Cabbage is a crop much cultiva∣ted in England for the food of cat∣tle.
<PB N="37" REF="031718_0036_0FEE1ABB001DCCE8"/>On a light loarn, plough the ground well in the fall; as soon as the frost is out of the ground, plough it again in the spring, and a third time about the beginning of April, or latter end of March. On this earth manure with compost, twelve loads to an acre, turn it in, in June. Sow the seed in a garden the mid∣dle of April; three quarters of a pound of seed for each acre intend∣ed to be planted. Prick out the plants when in two leaves six inch∣es apart from each other, in beds prepared for the purpose. About the 20th of June transplant them into the fields in rows three feet asunder, and the plants eighteen inches distant. This may be done by the slight mark left by the plow in striking every fourth furrow. If the ground is ploughed by a good ploughman, the rows will be quite straight enough without the trou∣blesome exactness of a line, which is otherwise necessary on flat land. Some plant in rows, four feet by two from plant to plant. And it has been observed that the larger
<PB N="38" REF="031718_0037_0FEE1ABC89302858"/>the plants are at setting out, so much better is the crop. The ground must be kept clean by hoe∣ing.</P>
<P>Strong clay land has been found to answer by the following culture. The land was summer-fallowed, or ploughed the year before, and again the spring following. The seed was sown in April, and the plants set on three feet ridges, two feet from each other, the 24th of June. They were horse-hoed twice with a skim plough, which is so construct∣ed as to cut or shave the surface of the ground without turning a ridge. The rows were twice hand-hoed, and after that furrows were struck with a common plough, earthing up the plants.</P>
<P>Cabbages are found to be excel∣lent for compleating the fattening of oxen or weathers which have had the summer's grass, and should be applied to that purpose and con∣sumed in the fall.</P>

<HEAD>The application of the foregoing crops in feeding.</HEAD>
<P>Potatoes boiled and mixed with rye or barley meal in the proportion of one or two bushels to twenty, fatten large hogs better than corn alone. In the proportion of one to forty, they fatten porkers, and half fatten bacon hogs. One third barley meal, and two thirds pota∣toes boiled, are found to exceed peas or barley alone in fattening hogs; but what is more material, experience has proved, that being boiled and given alone, they will fatten porkers as well as possible. Feeding cows with them has like∣wise been tried, and found to answer well, and the milk and butter have proved exceedingly good. But it is to be observed that it is bad man∣agement to give cows in winter a food which will answer for fatten∣ing any animal; and therefore the grand object of potatoe culture ought to be the fattening of hogs, for which use experience has proved
<PB N="40" REF="031718_0039_0FEE1AC6F3E4DDC8"/>they will answer in great perfecti∣on, and yield a large profit.</P>
<P>I have not heard of any accurate experiments to ascertain the best use that may be made of pumpkins: but as they are a rich solid food, I am inclined to think they may be applied to the purpose of fattening, and may be found nearly equal to carrots.</P>
<P>Carrots are found to be excellent for feeding horses and fattening sheep, cattle and hogs. Boiled and given to hogs, they have been found to be worth four pounds sterling a ton, or 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a bushel: given raw they are estimated to be worth 1<ABBR>s.</ABBR> sterling a bushel, or 40s, a ton, ei∣ther for feeding horses, or fattening hogs, sheep or cattle. It has been estimated, and experience has pro∣ved, that ten acres of good carrots will fatten sixty sheep, four large oxen, and winter eight horses: this sufficiently shews the great profit arising from this culture: Nor is this all, the ground is admirably cleared and prepared for future crops, and the dung arising in the
<PB N="41" REF="031718_0040_0FEE1AC881CAF430"/>expenditure of the crop is of vast consequence in the improvement of other fields. By actual experiments made, it has been found that twenty tons fattened four oxen, weighing on an average, 1330lb. in fourteen weeks, each beast having seven pounds of hay per day; and less than two hundred weight fattened a pig, bought for the purpose, and which sold to the butcher, yielded a profit of 8<ABBR>s.</ABBR> sterling.</P>
<P>The best use of cabbage has been mentioned above. The application of all roots to the food of cattle or hogs is the material object; because the difference in good husbandry between selling a crop and using it at home is immense. Upon the most moderate computation, one acre of potatoes or carrots, if the cattle are kept well littered, which may easily be done by collecting leaves or stubble, or both, will in the consumption raise dung enough to manure two acres well. The encreasing fertility of a farm, a part of which so employed, wants no il∣lustration: it is an object alone suffi∣cient
<PB N="42" REF="031718_0041_0FEE1ACA09F1A780"/>to change the face of land.</P>
<P>I shall omit making any observ∣ations on the culture of beans, peas, onions, &amp;c. my object being prin∣cipally the improvement of a farm with the view of raising and fatten∣ing stock. Where there are natural meadows, I presume these will not be neglected; and where there is a command of water, I take it for granted, a careful farmer will not fail to lead it over his sloping grounds, and the sides of hills which he will keep for mowing grounds. If he has boggy lands, he will be careful to drain them, or if that cannot be done, he will try to produce meadow or duck grass, which will grow in very miry places, and form a tolerable firm surface even upon bogs, so that in a few years they may not only be mowed, but will be sufficiently firm to bear hor∣ses and carts to carry off the hay.</P>

<HEAD>St. Foine; or Sainfoine.</HEAD>
<P>Where the land is gravelly and unfit for the culture before men∣tioned, it will be well to try the
<PB N="43" REF="031718_0042_0FEE1ACD6DCDA988"/>Sainfoine grass. This is a native of Italy or the hilly country border∣ing on the Alps: it is now much cultivated in France, and of late years has been introduced into En∣gland: and from all accounts, it appears as if it would answer well in this country. It strikes a deep root, grows on poor soils, and yields a large crop. Even when sown on the tops of hills, and on stony or gravelly ground, it is said that it will yield, on an average, two tons an acre, and a good fall pasture. It is sown broad cast among oats or o∣ther spring grain, in the same way as clover, and will last from fifteen to twenty years. Any soil will do for it if free from springs and stag∣nant water. When it grows wee∣dy it is harrowed till the ground has the appearance of a fallow. This destroys the weeds and natural gras∣ses without injuring the sainfoine, and adds to its duration. If one half of what is said of it be true, it certainly will deserve the attenti∣on of our farmers. The seed may be imported from France or England. The usual time of sowing it is in
<PB N="44" REF="031718_0043_0FEE1AD47B3A9518"/>April. The quantity of seed is four bushels to an acre. About ten loads of dung to an acre, laid on in the fall, every four years, and a good▪ harrowing the spring following is all the culture necessary.</P>
<P>There are several other artificial grasses, such as burnet, luzerne, &amp;c. which are highly recommended, but I have some doubt, notwithstand∣ing what is said of them, whether, upon a fair experiment, they will be found to excel our blue grass and white clover, or our red clover. Sainfoine, indeed, according to what is said of it, has this in its favour, that it will thrive and yield a good crop even on poor soils, may be sown with grain, and will last for many years. Its culture is cheap and simple, and when it begins to fail it may be soon renewed. But after all, the culture of clover de∣serves the particular attention of the farmer, and will be found to be one great pillar of good husbandry. The importance of a grass which is of so hardy a nature as to bear sow∣ing with grain, and is subject to
<PB N="45" REF="031718_0044_0FEE1AD6070F01C0"/>scarcely any failure; which will, the year after it is sown, yield from three to four tons of hay from an a∣cre, and oftentimes more at two mow∣ings; which will last one or perhaps two years longer, if it suits the far∣mer, and which is a better prepa∣ration for wheat than the finest fal∣low, requiring at the same time but one ploughing before the wheat is sowed. All these circumstances u∣nite to render clover an object of high importance and well deserving the attention of a farmer. The ad∣vantage will appear still greater, when it is considered that the crop may be all, and usually is, consumed by cattle at home. Hence the farmer is enabled to keep great stocks of cattle on soils where he could not otherwise have any, and thereby raise much dung, and keep his land in good heart.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have directed the at∣tention of the farmers almost alto∣gether to the collecting and making manure from his stock. This is the more necessary as other kinds of manure, such as marle lime, &amp;c.
<PB N="46" REF="031718_0045_0FEE1AD78F752B28"/>are not always within his reach; but where any of these can be got at a reasonable rate, he will be very wrong if he does not avail himself of the advantage.</P>

<HEAD>Liming land.</HEAD>
<P>As the subject of liming land is of importance, I will here insert the observations and practice of a friend of mine in the use of lime for ma∣nure, which he was so obliging as to communicate to me as follows:</P>
<P>"I have in the course of seven years, put on as many thousand bushels of lime in a great variety of modes. With respect to farming for wheat, rye or corn, every one takes his own method. It is impos∣sible to form a general rule to suit all soils. The method must depend on the quality of your land. If the land be much worn out it will take the less quantity of lime. The soil best adapted to lime is a loomy ground inclining to sand, at least I have found it to answer best, tho'
<PB N="47" REF="031718_0046_0FEE1ADAF7D4E860"/>I have heard of great things being done with lime on clay. Deep ploughing, in the first instance, ought to be practised, but shallow ploughing after the lime is laid on. Lime evaporates, but it has a great∣er inclination to sink into the earth. Mixing it well by frequent harrow∣ing is absolutely necessary. You may put on a greater quantity if you plough deep; but do not be in haste for your profit the first year as the cultivation requires frequent ploughing and tending. Rye will answer the first year; but wheat will come to nothing, as the crops on the limed lands are late, and the mildews with us operate most on late crops. I generally begin with forty bushels of unslacked lime per acre, and put on the same quantity every third year. This you may continue to do until you find your land in sufficient heart. I have never exceeded 120 bushels on an acre, put on as before described. My land would not average with∣out lime above eight bushels of wheat an acre, and when I had
<PB N="48" REF="031718_0047_0FED37E00066C498"/>limed it sufficiently, I have had in some instances twenty-five and on an average twenty bushels per acre. The best time for putting on lime is in the autumn; after ploughing deep, put on your lime, harrow it in and let the ground lie fallow through the winter. There is no advantage in letting your ground lie idle, as the lime wasts as well without as with a crop. If you chuse to turn ground into grass, the best way I have found is, after ta∣king off three crops of grain, to sow buckwheat with the grass seed after harvest. Let it lie three years in clover, which of itself meliorates the land; you may then plough it, and proceed with the usual cultiva∣tion for grain, putting on lime as be∣fore. I have successfully plouged clover in when it was in full blos∣som: This is a great nanure, and your crop overpays for the loss of the grass. I have found great bene∣fit in sprinkling a pint of slacked lime on every hill of Indian corn just after it is planted.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="031718_0048_0FEE1AE22ED25BD0"/>
On this I would just observe, that, had my friend attended to the true course of crops, he would have expe∣rienced much greater advantage from his lime. The taking three crops of grain; or even two crops, after Indi∣an corn, must foul the land and ex∣haust it too much.</P>
<P>There is another manure for grass, which has of late been highly extoll∣ed, I mean gypse or plaister of Paris, powdered fine and scattered over the ground, about three or four bushels to the acre. The stone used about Phi∣ladelphia has been brought from No∣va Scotia or Cape Breton. I am told there is a vein of it found in Bucks County in Pennsylvania, and another near Patuxent in Maryland. I wish further experiments to be made with this manure. I have had some made on light gravelly soils and on dry loa∣my ground, which produced amazing effects.</P>
<P>Having been informed that my friend, whose letter I have quoted a∣bove on the subject of lime, had made some experiments with gypse, which had exceeded his most sanguine ex∣pectation,
<PB N="50" REF="031718_0049_0FEE1AE3B6827F90"/>I wrote to him and request∣ed him to communicate to me his ex∣periments, and, at the same time con∣sulted him about taking one of my farms into my own management: his answer contained the following re∣marks.</P>
<P>"If you are serious about your farm, set somebody at work directly to clear your water courses on your meadow: mend your dams, and get somebody to look after them and the water courses this winter: (his letter was dated the 8th of November.) One week of the winter water, is better than a month in summer. Try a few bushels of lime on your meadow. I spread above twenty bushels to the acre last fall, and had good success. I did this because I could get no plais∣ter of Paris that was good. I am a devotee to the gypse upon my grass; my experience this way is of long standing; but as to grain, I never tri∣ed it till this year. I put on my In∣dian corn a small quantity, one large handful to four hills, and I think it produced a wonderful effect. About four bushels manured nine acres of
<PB N="51" REF="031718_0050_0FEE1AE543AD5090"/>corn. The whole of my field was li∣med; but I left some rows without the gypse. And though the corn is all good, there is a very perceptible dif∣ference. In the summer the gypsed corn was of a deeper green, and now the cars are much the largest. I also put some on a field adjoining, where the land was very poor, and had nei∣ther been dunged nor limed. The effect is the same comparatively with the other corn in this field, but not equal to the limed field. I tried a small quantity on buckwheat, and I think I saw a difference much to the advantage of the gypse in this experi∣ment. As to grass, I am convinced of its effects—I never tried it in vain. I have put only four bushels to the acre, and that in the spring, about the middle of March. It will not do for wet or sour land: it is best to scatter or sow it in calm drizly weather.</P>

<HEAD>4th, <HI>The choice and management of Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A choice of the breed of horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, which is too little regarded, is of great importance to a farmer, and deserves his closest attention. The expence is as great, may oftentimes greater, in keeping a creature of a bad breed as of a good, and the value is very different. It appears that the Canada breed of hor∣ses would be found excellent for the plough or for draught, and the Eso∣pus breed for the carriage. In the choice of horses, the form should be particularly attended to. The Cana∣da breed comes the nearest to the form of horses in the highest estimation in England for draught, to wit, that of a true round barrel, remarkably short, and lower over the forehand than in any part of the back; the legs also short. The Esopus breed, of a pro∣per shape and size, are sightly horses for a carriage: they are gentle, tract∣able, and easily broke, and yet have a proper degree of spirit—have a good
<PB N="53" REF="031718_0052_0FEE1AEFB56B52D0"/>carriage; are easily kept, and hardy. The Narraganset breed have been ac∣counted excellent for the saddle.</P>
<P>Mr. Bakewell, a farmer in England; has rendered himself famous by his breed of cattle. His principal aim is to gain the beast, whether sheep or cow, which will weigh most in the most valuable joints; and at the same time that he gains the shape, which is of the greatest value in the smallest compass; he finds, by experience, that he gains a breed much hardier, and easier fed than any others. In the breed of cattle, his maxim is "the smaller the bones, the truer will be the make of the beast; the quicker it will fatten, and the weight will have a lar∣ger proportion of valuable meat." The shape, which should be the criterion of a cow, a bull, or an ox, and also of a sheep, is that of a hogshead or barrel, truly circular, with small and as short legs as possible; upon this plain principle, that the value lies in the barrel, not in the legs. All breeds, the backs of which rise in the least ridge, are bad.</P>
<P>By proper management, Mr. Bake∣well
<PB N="54" REF="031718_0053_0FEE1AF141525160"/>brings up his cattle in amazing gentleness. His bulls stand still in the field to be examined. They are driven from one field to another, or home, by a little switch. He or his men walk by their side, and guide them with a stick wherever they please. His cattle are always fat, and this he insists is owing to the excellence of the breed. The small quantity and inferior quality of the food, which will keep a beast perfectly well made, in good order, is surprising. Such an animal will grow fat in the same pas∣ture that would starve an ill made, great boned one.</P>
<P>He is equally curious in his breed of sheep. The bodies of his rams and ewes are as true barrels as can be seen, round broad backs, and the legs not above six inches long. An unusual proof of their kindly fattening, is their feeling quite fat within their fore-legs, on the ribs, where the common breed never carry any fat. He finds that hardly any land is too bad for a good breed of cattle, and particularly sheep.</P>
<P>With regard to the rot in sheep, Mr. Bakewell thinks it is solely owing to their feeding on lands that have
<PB N="55" REF="031718_0054_0FEE1AF2C8FE94F0"/>been flooded. Hence it appears that sheep should not be suffered to feed on watered meadows. Water flowing over the land after the beginning of May, is sure to occasion the rot, what∣ever be the soil.</P>
<P>Mr. Bakewell is remarkably atten∣tive to the point of wintering his cat∣tle. All his cattle are tied up in open or other sheds all winter; and fed ac∣cording to their kind; on straw, tur∣nips, or hay. The lean beasts have straw alone. Young cattle, which re∣quire to be kept in a thriving state, and also fattening ones, have turnips; and in the spring, when turnips are gone, hay is wholly their substitute. By these means he is able to keep a large stock. His farm, in all, con∣sists of about 440 acres, 110 acres of which are arable, the rest is grass; and he keeps sixty horses, four hun∣dred large sheep, one hundred and fifty horned beasts of all sorts, yet has generally fifteen acres of wheat and twenty-five acres of spring corn.</P>
<P>He has adopted a new system in the management of his horned cattle. He used to draw with teams of ox∣en, and found that he must keep
<PB N="56" REF="031718_0055_0FEE1AF45E241C38"/>double the number worked, to have one set coming into work and ano∣ther going out. He therefore chan∣ged that system and draws all with cows. They are kept on straw till three years old, then bulled and worked till four years old; by which means he finds a great saving; and that calves bred from cows ri∣sing from-three to four, far exceed those from cows rising from two to three years. He finds also that the teams of cows are full as handy, and draw as well as oxen of the same size.</P>
<P>In working with cows or oxen, I am persuaded, if harness was used instead of yokes, the cattle would draw with much greater power, would move faster, and be more handy and convenient. The har∣ness should be much the same as that for horses; except the collar's o∣pening to be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hled on, and be∣ing worn in the contrary manner to horses, tha is, the narrow end of the collar which opens being downwards; and as the chains are fastened to them in the same direc∣tion
<PB N="57" REF="031718_0056_0FEE1AFD4D6CF360"/>as in horse-harness, the cattle draw with them much higher than horses, the line of the chains being above the chest, and almost up to their backs. This variation is ne∣cessary from the different shapes of horses and oxen.</P>
<P>The suffering the horns of cattle to grow, is oftentimes highly disad∣vantageous, by the cattle's goring each other; and at the same time it renders them more unruly and un∣tractable. For these reasons a far∣mer in Pennsylvania has fallen upon a practice to prevent the horns of his cattle from growing. His me∣thod is, when a calf is a month old and the horns begin to sprout, he cuts off the knobs with a chizel, and with a sharp gouge pares them clean from the bone; he then sears the wound and fills it with hog's lard. He says he never lost a calf by the operation, and that they did not seem to thrive the less for it; that the loss of their offensive wea∣pon seemed to change the very na∣ture of his cattle in respect to gen∣tleness; and on that account he ap∣prehended
<PB N="58" REF="031718_0057_0FEE1AFED5B7E020"/>his cows gave more milk, and his cattle were easier raised and housed in the winter. For he could drive them young and old into a close yard or stable like a flock of sheep, without difficulty or danger.</P>

<HEAD>Fifth. <HI>Respecting the orchard and its produce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The care of orchards and the ma∣king good cyder is so very profita∣ble, that it will necessarily draw the attention of every farmer.</P>
<P>Mr. Anderton, a gentleman in England, famed for good cyder, gives the following account of his approved method of making it.</P>
<P>"I should first tell you my or∣chards are on a clay soil, which cir∣cumstance I think conduces much to the strength and goodness of the li∣quor. I will be short in my practi∣cal account, making but few obser∣vations, and leave the curious to draw speculative reflections from it. I permit my fruit to remain on the trees till a great part of them fall by ripeness; then gently shaking
<PB N="59" REF="031718_0058_0FEE1B005E163D70"/>the trees, take in the apples in dry weather, laying them in heaps of equal ripeness in a loft over the press. There they remain till they have perspired, and that perspirati∣on ceases. As soon as convenient afterwards, I press out the juice; if it casts a pale colour I permit the pulp after it has passed the mill, to remain in vats or other open recep∣tacles for twenty-four hours, which will heighten the colour of the juice. As soon as it is impressed, I pour it into vats through a sieve, where it remains about two days and a night, according to the na∣ture of the apple and the state of the weather, (the longest when a frost) till a thick head or scum rises on it. Then I draw off a little in a glass to see if it is fine; and as soon as I catch it so, I fail not without delay to draw it off into open vats, if I have them, if not into hogsheads. If the juice be put from the press into vessels wider at top than at bottom, and I draw it off as soon as fine, I need not take off the head first, as in going downwards, it
<PB N="60" REF="031718_0059_0FEE1B01E6777D08"/>will not, in that case, break and mix with the body of the liquor. But if my vessel, in which it is, be of another construction, or I have not been attentive to draw it off in the critical hour, I find I do better before I begin to draw, to take off the head with a wooden skimmer and throw it away, and then speed∣ily draw off the cyder. Whenever I find the brown head begins to o∣pen in the middle or elsewhere and a whiteness appear at the opening, I'm pretty certain it is high time to be busy in drawing off. But I find from experience that the surest to∣ken is to observe its state by what is drawn off in a glass, which is to be done by the help of a peg placed at a proper distance from the bot∣tom of the vat, and this method of observation should be closely attend∣ed to; for I have drawn a glass of cyder out of a vat at eight o'clock, foul, another at ten, fine; almost candle-bright, without any appear∣ance of the head's opening as above observed: at eleven, it was grow∣ing cloudy apace, without high
<PB N="61" REF="031718_0060_0FEE1B0AE38356D0"/>winds or any extraordinary event which I could perceive, to occasion it: and I found it absolutely necessa∣ry not to loose a moment in drawing it off. If then drawn off into other open vessels, a fresh head may arise in twenty-four hours or thereabouts, when it may be racked into a close hogshead or other receiver, where it will begin to ferment after a day or two, according to the weather, the nature of the fruit, and other circum∣stances, I then permit it to ferment four or five days generally, never ex∣ceeding a week for the hardest fruit, such as wildings, &amp;c. Then I fumi∣gate a clean sweet hogshead or other close vessel, with a match or two made of coarse cloth, dipped into melted stone-brimstone, and rack the cyder into it as speedily as possible, watch∣ing it again in the same manner, till I catch it very fine. When another such racking often turns out the final one. I cover the bung with a tile or piece of thin wood only during the season of racking; and when I put a bung-cork into the hole in the spring, I leave a peg-hole open just by it.
<PB N="62" REF="031718_0061_0FEE1B0C6C548E78"/>The foeces through the whole process are constantly removed. I never seek to raise frequent fermentations, and often compleat the business by two or three rackings; but have had very good cyder, which has been so prone to ferment, that I have been obliged to stop it by racking it into fumigated vessels ten, and even upwards of a dozen times. Many other, probably much better methods of stopping the fermentation, and bringing the cyder fine, I have heard of; but these are what I have in general hitherto used, and have the satisfaction of finding my cyder as good as most I meet with elsewhere. And though I am far from thinking my management unimprova∣ble, I will answer for its turning out well to those, who being unacquaint∣ed with a better method, will attend to this."</P>
<P>On a farm managed as above men∣tioned, where there will necessarily be much food for bees, the care and ma∣nagement of them will naturally at∣tract the attention of an intelligent farmer. The expence and trouble is so trifling, and the profit so great, that
<PB N="63" REF="031718_0062_0FEE1B0DF59EA388"/>he would be inexcusable, if he did not add this to the profit of his farm. Bees will spare a considerable portion of their labours, and may be preser∣ved through the winter; and as the portion of wax and honey, which they can spare, may easily be taken with∣out injuring them, I trust the barba∣rous practice will not be followed, of destroying whole swarms in order to enjoy the fruits of their labours.</P>
<P>There are several authors who have written on the subject of bees. Wild∣man and White are the most approved. A careful perusal of them is therefore recommended to all who undertake the management of bees.</P>

<HEAD>Observations on the best method of resto∣ring worn-out soils, without manure: —from the 2d. vol. of the Correspond∣ence Book of the Society instituted at Bath, in England, for the encourage∣ment of Agriculture, Arts, Manu∣factures, and Commerce.</HEAD>
<P>THE first thing necessary on such lands is, immediately after harvest, to turn them up with the plough as
<PB N="64" REF="031718_0063_0FEE1B1157288338"/>deep as possible. In order to do this effectually, it will sometimes be need∣ful for a second plough to follow the first in the same furrow; which will throw the mould over, and bury the stubble and weeds. In this case there will be a new soil uppermost, which, being fresh to the air, will receive much greater and more lasting bene∣fit from the sun, the rain, and the frosts, than it otherwise could do, as thereby it will attract a greater quan∣tity of the nutrition which these afford. The stubble and weeds, being by this method of ploughing buried deep, will much sooner rot than when just cover∣ed. In this state the ridges will lie high, and if the land be wet or of the brick-earth kind, will be full of clods or large lumps.</P>
<P>No time should now be lost by de∣laying to render this newly turned-up soil, as fine as harrowing can make it. I know in this particular, my judg∣ment will be called in question by numbers. Common farmers will say, "To what purpose is all this expence and labour, when, if the land be suf∣fered to lie in its rough state through
<PB N="65" REF="031718_0064_0FEE1B169D5097C8"/>the winter, the frosts and rains will do the work for you?" But this is the language of the sluggard and inexpe∣rienced husbandman, only.</P>
<P>I am convinced, by repeated expe∣riments, close observations, and plain reasoning on known facts, that lands which are made fine before the sharp frost and winter rains come on, will receive a much greater share of their influence than any other.</P>
<P>If the land be left in a rough state, there is seldom time for the rains and frost to affect more than the out-side of the large clods or lumps; the out∣side will indeed be pulverized, but the middle of the lumps, wherever they are large, will be found nearly in the same hard stiff state as when turned up by the plough. Hence it must appear to every one, that in this ease the benefit of air, winter rains, and frosts, on lands thus left, is par∣tial; and the consequence is, that harrowing it in the spring, when these are over, is too late for its receiving the benefit which would have accrued from them; and the power of vegeta∣tion is not so vigorous.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="031718_0065_0FEE1B1A1A361158"/>
But to make winter fallows as fine as they can be in autumn, and then ridge them up in that pulver∣ized state, is acting most agreeable to nature. The greatest possible quantity of surface is by this means exposed to the atmosphere; and the land is left in a state wherein the rains and the frost are most easily admissible. They will then pene∣trate and enrich the whole mass to a greater depth.</P>
<P>If the frost penetrates a quantity of earth, formed into a large hard clod, partially, on account of its bulk and hardness (which is always sound to be the case) it is evident that the same clod, broken into four parts, would be thereby pene∣trated four times as much; or, in other words four times the quanti∣ty of earth would be affected by it, and on a thaw be pulverized. For we find that, after the breaking up of a severe frost, all the small clods crumble easily into powder; while the large ones are only made small∣er by the crumbling of their sur∣face to a certain depth.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="031718_0066_0FEE1B1D6FE16A70"/>
By this deep ploughing which I have recommended, the worn-out foil being turned in, the second stra∣tum or fresh earth is now upper∣most; and having, by being made as fine as it can be in autumn, been exposed to the air, the rain, and the frost during winter, is thereby sweetened and cleansed of its impu∣rities; and thus becomes a new fresh fertilized earth, in the best possible state, for vigorous vegeta∣tion.</P>
<P>Many farmers will probably ob∣ject to this method, on account of its being attended with a little ex∣tra expence. But I wish them to consider, first, that this expense is more in appearance than reality, for less labour is requisite in the spring; and secondly, that it will be amply repaid by the goodness of succeed∣ing crops.</P>
<P>About seven years since, I made a comparative experiment of this kind on a field of ten acres, the soil of which was equal as possible in goodness. The one half of this field I left after ploughing in its
<PB N="68" REF="031718_0067_0FEE1B20D3A914C0"/>rough state, the surface being co∣vered with large hard clods. The other half I made as fine as possible by harrowing with ox harrows, and beating in pieces the hardest and largest clods which the harrow would not break.</P>
<P>In the spring, the part I had har∣rowed was much finer, without any additional labour, than I could ren∣der the other (which was left in its rough state) by repeated harrow∣ings; for the rain and the frost ha∣ving not penetrated the middle of the large clods, they had received no benefit therefrom, and were as hard as bricks, being only lessened in size.</P>
<P>I sowed the whole field in barley the last week in April, and threw nine pounds of broad clover in with it. On harvesting it, I kept the crops seperate: the part left rough produced twenty-four bushels per acre; the other thirty-one, the lat∣ter by much the finest sample. The crop of clover next year was equal∣ly in favour of the method I am re∣commending, being heavier by near half a ton per acre.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="031718_0068_0FEE1B242F927780"/>
The extra expence on this part was only about eight shillings per a∣cre; the extra produce yielded an extra profit of more than twenty shillings per acre.</P>

<HEAD>A method for preventing the destruction of Apple-trees, by Canker worms.</HEAD>
<P>THE insects from which the can∣ker worms are produced, are hid in the ground near the root of the tree, not far from the surface, and make their appearance as soon as the snow is off, and the top of the ground soft (which sometimes hap∣pens as early as February.) The males have wings, and frequently fly directly to the limbs, without touching the body of the tree; for∣tunately the females have none, but are a very clumsy bug, and very easily stopped by tarring the tree. To do this with success, it is very necessary, that the tar made use of be of a proper consistence; if it be very thick it will be impossible to lay it on without first heating,
<PB N="70" REF="031718_0069_0FEE1B27D2B68ED0"/>which makes it form a hard sur∣face when cold, that suffers the bug to pass over without difficulty; some endeavour to remedy this in∣convenience by mixing train oil with the tar, but the thin kind of tar without oil is far preferable; if this be exposed to the sun through the day it will be sufficiently soft to be laid on with a brush. It is best the rough bark should be scra∣ped off with a hoe or some other convenient instrument, and the tar put round the tree about four inch∣es wide; this operation must be re∣peated every day, when the state of the ground will permit them to move, until they have done going up. It is not common that the weather is such as to permit them to stir until the middle, and often until the latter end of March; when that is the case, and the weather continues warm, they will be all out of the ground in about fourteen days; but as they are commonly interrupted with snow or cold, it will generally be necessary to tar as many as twenty times, and some∣times
<PB N="71" REF="031718_0070_0FEE1B295C0A44B8"/>more. The time that is ge∣nerally chosen to begin is about two hours before sun-set (which is the time the insects begin to move) and if not finished until an hour after the sun is down (after the first time) it is immaterial, for the tar that is already on the tree, softened by the warmth of the sun, will be suffici∣ent to stop them until that time. I am sensible there have been seve∣ral objections to this method of tar∣ring, viz. that it is attended with trouble and expence; that it in∣jures the tree, and after all that it is ineffectual. As to the expence, a barrel of tar is sufficient for an orchard that will make an hundred barrels of cyder; and four persons in two hours will be able to tar the whole at once; allowing this to be repeated twenty times, the expence cannot be great, and experience has sufficiently proved, that it does not injure the tree. I know of several orchards that have been tarred (as often as the worms visited them) for twenty years, and could never perceive any injury done them; on
<PB N="72" REF="031718_0071_0FEE1B305EE2DC40"/>the contrary, I know of some others in the same neighbourhood, that have not been tarred, entirely de∣stroyed by the worms. If the tree be thrifty, it will be necessary some time in the summer following, to scrape off the tar, or make a few incisions through it, to prevent the bark from being confined. That it has never proved ineffectual, I be∣lieve no one can produce an in∣stance, where proper steps have been taken; but where it has fail∣ed, it has been owing to improper management, or want of perseve∣rance.</P>

<HEAD>Observations on the management of Bees, with directions for taking their honey without destroying them.</HEAD>
<P>BEES, an industrious and profit∣able species of insects. Rural eco∣nomy is incomplete, where bees are wanting. The cost of keeping them is nothing, and the care that is re∣quired about them is but trifling.</P>
<P>There are three sorts of bees in a hive: 1. The Queen bee, which
<PB N="73" REF="031718_0072_0FEE1B31E728CF90"/>is larger, and of a brighter red than the rest. Her business is to conduct the new swarms and lay eggs in the cells for a new brood: and her fer∣tility is so great, that she brings forth many thousands of young ones in a year. 2. The drones, which have no stings, are of a darker co∣lour than the rest, and are supposed to be the males. 3. The honey∣bees, or working bees, which are by far more numerous than the other two kinds.</P>
<P>A bee-house should be situated at a good distance from the places where cattle are kept, especially from hog-sties, hen and dove-hou∣ses, and remote from filth and dung∣hills. It should be defended from high wind on all sides, so far as may be, consistently with admitting the heat of the sun. The house should be open to the south or south-west, and the back-side should be very tight; with a tight roof projecting, that driving rains may not injure the bees. If snow lodges upon or about the hives, it should be brush∣ed off without delay. The bench
<PB N="74" REF="031718_0073_0FEE1B336F969630"/>on which the hives stand, should be a little canting outwards, that if wet should fall on it, it may run off without entering the hives. Mr. Bromwick proposes, "that a bee∣house be boarded in front; and that the back-side should consist of three doors, which opened, give a full view of the hives, and give oppor∣tunity to assist or lift them. All seams should be stopped which would admit insects, from which the house is often to be brushed.</P>
<P>"If the house should be in dan∣ger of being too hot, when thus enclosed, it may be occasionally shaded with boughs of trees. As winter approaches, all the seams of the house are plaistered with clay. In very cold climates, the house should be filled with straw, to keep the bees warm, watching against mice, and removing the straw in the spring.</P>
<P>"Cut a hole through the front, of the same size as the mouth of the lower hive, and directly against it. Under this passage, on a level with the floor, is a lighting board, at
<PB N="75" REF="031718_0074_0FEE1B34F80840E8"/>the mouth of each hive, of about five inches long and three wide. It is a little shelf for the bees to land upon after their excursions. These being separate, not in one piece of the length of the house, is to pre∣vent intercourse between colony and colony; but more essentially to prevent mice, snails, and other in∣truders. These alighting boards are sometimes painted of different colours, to direct each bee to his home more readily. A long shel∣ving board should be placed over the alighting boards, to shelter the bees in a rainy time. It should be twelve inches wide, and placed nine inches above the mouths of the hives."</P>
<P>Broom, clover, and mustard, are said to afford bees an excellent pas∣ture, and they appear very fond of the flowers of poppies. Gardens, and any places where flowers a∣bound, and especially where there is a succession of flowers through the greater part of the year, are the most favourable to them: for they undoubtedly draw the princi∣pal
<PB N="76" REF="031718_0075_0FEE1B3A2C511F90"/>part of their honey from the nectaria of flowers. Fields of buck∣wheat are good, as they continue in bloom for a long time. In Ger∣many they move their bee-hives in boats, to the neighbouring fields of buckwheat.</P>
<P>Bees are wont to send out new swarms in May and June. Much has been written concerning the management of them on these occa∣sions. But the new mode of mana∣ging them renders all this unneces∣sary.—It is this: let the bee-house be made so tall as to admit three tier of hives, one above another. The hives should not be tall shaped, but rather broad and short, that they may take up less room. A hive of such dimensions as to be equal to a cube of thirteen inches, will be sufficiently capacious. Mr. Ther∣ley directs that they should be ten inches deep, and from twelve to fourteen broad in the inside. If hives be made larger, the swarms will not multiply so fast. An under hive is made with a round hole through the top, of three inches
<PB N="77" REF="031718_0076_0FEE1B41314B5E98"/>diameter, covered with a sliding shutter. Each hive or box should have a passage at the bottom for the bees to pass in and out, 4 or 5 inches long, and about one third of an inch deep. One of these hives should be placed directly under an inhabited hive, before they are dis∣posed to send out a new swarm. This will prevent the going out of a swarm, and save trouble and watching: for instead of swarming when the upper hive is full, they will build and deposit their honey in the one that is below; and when that is full, let them find another beneath it:—they will take possess∣ion of the lowermost. It is their manner always to begin at the top, and build downwards. For ano∣ther method of management, see "Cohite's collateral Bee-boxes."</P>
<P>When the top hive is well filled with honey, it may be discovered by lifting it, or more accurately by weighing it gently with a steelyard, in a cool morning, when the bees are stiff, and not apt to come out.</P>
<P>When a hive is taken up, there
<PB N="78" REF="031718_0077_0FEE1B42BA9901D0"/>is no need of murdering the poor infects with fire and brimstone, as has been the usual practice: only drive in the shutter, and run a thin long knife round, to part it from that which is below it; slip the hive off upon a smooth piece of board, or slide the board under, and carry the hive into your dwell∣ing house, which you may do in a cool morning without any danger from their stings. Lay the hive upon its side, and have a window of the room open. As the sun gets up, and the air grows warmer, they will quit the hive, and go in∣to the hive next to the place whence they were taken. When you take out the honey, which should be done speedily, the bees that are found among the honey, stiff and unable to fly, should be thrown in∣to a tub of water. They will soon recover their activity, and go after their companions.</P>
<P>Some practise feeding bees. But says one, "There is but little use in it, because those which have not a good stock of honey to serve them through the winter, are not fit to
<PB N="79" REF="031718_0078_0FEE1B444677D2A0"/>keep."—He adds, "There are some stocks of bees in the spring time, that may seem worthy of our care to preserve; such as have but little honey, and a good number of bees, by means of a cold and dry spring, yet in all probability may prove an excellent stock, and may be worth consideration."</P>
<P>"The best method of supplying bees with food, is by small canes, or troughs conveyed into their hives; and beginning in March when they begin to breed, and sit on their young, it must be daily continued, till the season affords ease and provision abroad.</P>
<P>"Honey is not only the best, but the most natural of all food, and will go much farther mixed well with a moderate quantity of good sweet wort. Some prescribe toasts of bread sopped in good ale, and put into the hive, whereof they will not leave one crumb remain∣ing."</P>
<P>Mr. Therley advises when stocks of bees are weak, to double them, which he thinks the most effectual way of preserving them in common
<PB N="80" REF="031718_0079_0FEE1B45CE372130"/>hives. He does it by the help of a fume, or opiate, which will so stupify them for a time, that they may be handled at pleasure. Ha∣ving done this the queen must be searched for and killed. And exa∣mine whither the stock to which you intend to join the bees of ano∣ther, have honey enough to main∣tain the bees of both: it should weigh twenty pounds.</P>
<P>"The narcotic or stupifying fume, is made with the large mush∣room, commonly known by the name of bunt, puckfist, or froge∣huse. It is of a brown colour, turns to powder, and is exceeding light. Put one of these pucks in a large paper; press it therein to two thirds, or half its former bulk, and tie it up very close; then put it into an oven after the bread has been drawn, and let it remain there all night. When it is dry enough to hold fire, it is fit for use. The manner of using it is thus:</P>
<P>"Cut off a piece of puck as large as a hen's egg, and fix it in the end of a small stick slit for that purpose, and sharpened at the other end,
<PB N="81" REF="031718_0080_0FEE1B4EB61517C0"/>which place so that the puck may hang near the middle of the empty hive. This hive must be set with the mouth upwarps, near the stock you intend to take. This being done, set fire to the puck, and im∣mediately place the stock of bees over it, tying a cloth round the hives, that no smoke may come forth. In a minute's time, you will hear the bees fall like drops of hail, into the empty hive. You may then beat the top of the hive gently with your hand, to get out as many of them as you can. After this, loosing the cloth, lift the hive off to a table, knock it several times against the table, several more bees will tumble out, and perhaps the queen among them. She often is one of the last that falls. If she is not there, search for her among the main body in the empty hive, spreading them for this purpose on the table.</P>
<P>"You must proceed in the same manner with the other hive, with the bees of which these are to be united. One of the queens being secured, you must put the bees of
<PB N="82" REF="031718_0081_0FEE1B50439A2E20"/>both hives together; mingle them thoroughly, and drop them among the combs of the hive which they are intended to inhabit. When they are all in, cover it with a packing or coarse cloth, which will admit air, and let them re∣main shut up all that night, and the next day. You will soon be sensible they are awaked from their sleep.</P>
<P>"The second night after their union, in the dusk of the evening, gently remove the cloth from off the mouth of the hive, and the bees will immediately sally forth with a great noise, but being too late they will soon return. Then keep them confined for two or three days, after which the door may be lest open."</P>
<P>It is convenient to have a pane of glass in each hive, in order to watch the motions of the bees, and to know by inspection when is the right time to take up a hive. The Rev. Mr. White says, "In the back part you must cut a hole with a rabbet, in which you are to fix a pane of the clearest and best crown
<PB N="83" REF="031718_0082_0FEE1B51CB1E63C8"/>glass, about five inches in length, and three in breadth, and fasten it with putty. Let the top of the glass be placed as high as the roof withinside, that you may see the up∣per part of the combs, where the bees with their riches are mostly placed. You will, by this means, be the bet∣ter able to judge of their state and strength, than if your glass was fixed in the middle. The glass must be co∣vered with a thin piece of board by way of shutter, which may be made to hang by a string, or turn upon a nail, or slide sideways between two mouldings. Such as are desirous of seeing more of the bees' works, may make the glass as large as the box will admit, without weakening it too much. Or they may add a pane of glass on the top, which must likewise be co∣vered with a shutter, fastened down with pegs to prevent accidents.</P>
<P>"Be careful to fasten the shutter so close to the glass, that no light may enter; for the bees seem to look up∣on such a light as a hole, or breach in their house, and on that account may not so well like their habitation."</P>
