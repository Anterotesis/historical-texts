<P>THE subject of this following Narrative offering it self to your friendly Perusal; relates to the Former and Later Wars of <HI>New-England,</HI> which I my self was not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le concerned in: For in the Year, <HI>1675.</HI> that unhappy and bloody <HI>Indian</HI> War broke out in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony, where I was then building, and be∣ginning a Plantation, at a Place called by the <HI>Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seconit;</HI> and since by the <HI>English, Little Compton.</HI> I was the first <HI>English Man</HI> that built upon that Neck, which was full of <HI>Indians.</HI> My head and hands were full about Settling a New Plantation, where nothing was brought to; no preparation of Dwelling House, or Out-Housing or Fencing made, Horses and Cattel were to be provided, Ground to be clear'd, and broke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up; and the uttermost Caution to be used, to keep my self free from offending my <HI>Indian</HI> Neighbours all round about me: While I was thus busily Employed, and all my Time and Strength laid out in this La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ious Undertaking; I Received a Commission from the Government to engage in their Defence.

<HEAD>Entertaining Passages Relating to <HI>Philip's</HI> WAR which began in the Year, 1675. With the Proceedings of Benj. Church <ABBR>Esqr</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1674. Mr. <HI>Benjamin Church</HI> of <HI>Duxbury</HI> being providen∣tially at <HI>Plymouth</HI> in the time of the Court, fell into acquaintance with Capt. <HI>John Almy</HI> of <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> Capt. <HI>Almy</HI> with great impor∣tunity invited him to ride with him, and view that part of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony that lay next to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> known then by their Indian Names of <HI>Pocasset</HI> &amp; <HI>Segkonate.</HI> Among other arguments to perswade him, he told him, the Soil was very rich, and the Situation pleasant. Perswades him by all means, to purchase of the Company some of the Court grant rights. He accepted his invitation, views the Country, &amp; was pleased with it; makes a purchase, settled a Farm, found the Gentlemen of the Island very Civil &amp; obliging. And being himself a Person of uncommon Activi∣ty and Industry, he soon erected two buildings upon his Farm, and gain'd a good acquaintance with the Natives: got much into their favour, and was in a little time in great esteem among them.</P>
<P>The next Spring advancing, while Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was diligently Settling his new Farm, stocking, leasing &amp; disposing of his Affairs, and had a fine pros∣pect of doing no small things; and hoping that his good success would be inviting unto other good Men to become his Neighbours; Behold! the rumour of a War between the <HI>English</HI> and the Natives gave check to his projects. People began to be very jealous of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and indeed they had no small reason to suspect that they had form'd a design of War upon the <HI>English.</HI> Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had it daily suggested to him that the Indians were plotting a bloody design. That <HI>Philip</HI> the great <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Sachem was Leader therein: and so it prov'd, he was sending his Messengers to all
<PB N="2" REF="001800_0005_0FB82C0CA045EAC8"/>the Neighbouring Sachem:, to ingage them in a Confederacy with him in the War.</P>
<P>Among the reft he sent Six Men to <HI>Awashonks</HI> Squaw-Sachem of the <HI>Seg∣konate</HI> Indians, to engage her in his Interests: <HI>Awashonks</HI> so far listened unto them as to call her Subjects together, to make a great Dance, which is the custom of that Nation when they advise about Momentous Affairs. But what does <HI>Awashonks</HI> do, but sends away two of her Men that well under∣stood the <HI>English</HI> Language (<HI>Sassamon</HI> and <HI>George</HI> by Name) to invite Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to the Dance. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> upon the Invitation, immediately takes with him <HI>Charles Hazelton</HI> his Tennants Son, who well understood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Language, and rid down to the Place appointed: Where they found hun∣dreds of <HI>Indians</HI> gathered together from all Parts of her Dominion. <HI>Awa∣shonks</HI> her self in a foaming Sweat was leading the Dance. But she was no sooner sensible of Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> arrival, but she broke off, sat down, calls her Nobles round her, orders Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to be invited into her presence. Complements being past, and each one taking Seats. She told him, King <HI>Philip</HI> had sent Six Men of his with two of her People that had been over at <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> to draw her into a confederacy with him in a War with the <HI>English.</HI> Desiring him to give her his advice in the case, and to tell her the Truth whether the <HI>Umpame</HI> Men (as <HI>Philip</HI> had told her) were gather∣ing a great Army to invade <HI>Philips</HI> Country. He assured her he would tell her the Truth, and give her his best advice. Then he told her twas but a few days since he came from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and the <HI>English</HI> were then making no Preparations for War; That he was in Company with the Principal Gen∣tlemen of the Government, who had no Discourse at all about War; and he believ'd no tho'ts about it. He ask'd her whether she tho't he would have brought up his Goods to Settle in that Place, if he apprehended an entering into War with so near a Neighbour. She seem'd to be some what convin'd by his talk, and said she believ'd he spoke the Truth.</P>
<P>Then she called for the <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Men: Who made a formidable ap∣pearance, with their Faces Painted, and their Hair Trim'd up in Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fashion, with their Powder-horns, and Shot-bags at their backs; which a∣mong that Nation is the posture and figure of preparedness for War. She told Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> these were the Persons that had brought her the Report of the <HI>English</HI> preparation for War: And then told them what Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had said in answer to it.</P>
<P>Upon this began a warm talk among the Indians, but 'twas soon quash'd, and <HI>Awashonks</HI> proceeded to tell Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> that <HI>Philips</HI> Message to her was, that unless she would forth-with enter into a confederacy with him in a War against the <HI>English,</HI> he would send his Men over primely, to kill the <HI>English</HI> Cattel, and burn their Houses on that side the River, which would provoke the <HI>English</HI> to fall upon her, whom they would without doubt sup∣pose
<PB N="3" REF="001800_0006_0FB82C1083BE2910"/>the author of the Mischief. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told her he was sorry to see so threatning an aspect of Affairs; and steping to the <HI>Mount-hopes,</HI> he felt of their bags, and finding them filled with Bullets, ask'd them what those Bullets were for: They scoffingly reply'd to shoot <HI>Pigeons</HI> with.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Church</HI> turn'd to <HI>Awashonks,</HI> and told her if <HI>Philip</HI> were resolv'd to make War, her best way would be to knock those Six <HI>Mount-hopes</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> head, and shelter her self under the Protection of the <HI>English:</HI> upon which the <HI>Mount-bopes</HI> were for the present Dumb. But those two of <HI>Awashonks</HI> Men who had been at <HI>Mount-hope</HI> express'd themselves in a furious manner against his advice. And <HI>Little Eyes</HI> one of the Queens Council joyn'd with them, and urged Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to go aside with him among the bushes that he might have some private Discourse with him, which other Indians imme∣diately forbid being sensible of his ill design: but the Indians began to side and grow very warm. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> with undaunted Courage told the <HI>Mount-hopes</HI> they were bloody wretches, and thirsted after the blood of their <HI>English</HI> Neighbours, who had never injur'd them, but had always abounded in their kindness to them. That for his own part, tho' he desired nothing more than Peace, yet if nothing but Was would satisfie them, he believed he should prove a sharp thorne in their sides; Bid the Company observe those Men that were of such bloody dispositions, whether Providence would suffer them to Live to see the event of the War, which others more Peace∣ably disposed might do.</P>
<P>Then he told <HI>Awashonks</HI> he thought it might be most advisable for her to send to the Governour of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and shelter her self, and People under his Protection. She lik'd his advice, and desired him to go on her behalf to the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Government, which he consented to: And at parting ad∣vised her what ever she did, not to desert the <HI>English</HI> Interest, to joyn with her Neighbours in a Rebellion which would certainly prove fatal to her. [He mov'd none of his Goods from his House that there might not be the least umbrage from such an Action.] She thank'd him for his advice, and sent two of her Men to guard him to his House; which when they came here, urged him to take care to secure his Goods, which he refused for the reasons before mentioned. But desired the <HI>Indians,</HI> that if what they feared, should happen, they would take care of what he left, and directed them to a Place in the woods where they should dispose them; which they faith-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elly observed.</P>
<P>He took his leave of his guard, and bid them tell their Mistress, if she continued steady in her dependence on the <HI>English,</HI> and kept within her own limits of <HI>Sogkonats,</HI> he would see her again quickly; and then hastned away to <HI>Pocasset,</HI> where he met with <HI>Peter Nunnui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the Husband of the Queen of <HI>Pocasset,</HI> who was just then come over in a Canoo from <HI>Mount-hope.</HI> Peter told him that there would certainly be War; for <HI>Philip</HI> had held a
<PB N="4" REF="001800_0007_0FB82C156F200E70"/>Dance of several Weeks continuance, and had entertain'd the Young Men from all Parts of the Country: And added the <HI>Philip</HI> expected to be sent for to <HI>Plymouth</HI> to be examined about <HI>Sasamon's</HI> death, who was Murder'd at <HI>Assawomset</HI>-Ponds; knowing himself guilty of contriving that Murder. The same <HI>Peter</HI> told him that he saw Mr. <HI>James Brown</HI> of <HI>Swanzey,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Gorton</HI> who was an Interpreter, and two other Men who brought a Letter from the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> to <HI>Philip.</HI> He observ'd to him fur∣ther, that the Young Men were very eager to begin the War, and would fain have kill'd Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> but <HI>Philip</HI> prevented it; telling them that his Father had charged him to shew kindness to Mr. <HI>Brown.</HI> In short, <HI>Philip</HI> was forc'd to promise them that on the next Lords-Day when the <HI>English</HI> were gone to Meeting they should rifle their Houses and from that time for∣ward kill their Cattel.</P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> desir'd Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to go and see his Wife, who was but up the! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill; he went and found but few of her People with her. She said they were all gone, against her Will to the Dances; and she much fear'd there would be a War. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> advis'd her to go to the Island and secure her self, and those that were with her; and send to the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> who she knew was her friend; and so left her, resolving to hasten to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and wait on the Governour: and he was so expeditious that he was with the Governour early next Morning, tho' he waited on some of the Ma∣gistrates by the way, who were of the Council of War, and also met him at the Governours. He gave them an account of his observations and dis∣coveries, which confirmed their former intelligences, and hastned their pre∣paration for Defence.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> according to his promise to his People, permitted them to March out of the Neck on the next Lords-Day, when they plundred the nearest Houses that the Inhabitants had deserted: but as yet offer'd no violence to the People, at lest none were killed. However the alarm was given by their Numbers, and hostile Equipage, and by the Prey they made of what they could find in the forsaken Houses.</P>
<P>An express came the same day to the Governour, who immediately gave orders to the Captains of the Towns to March the greatest Part of their Companies, and to rand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous at <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>,</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> Night, where Major <HI>Bradford</HI> was to receive them, and dispose them under Capt (now made Major) <HI>Cutwo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th</HI> of <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te.</HI> The Governour desired Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to give them his Company, and to use his interest in their behalf with the Gentle∣men of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> He comply'd with it, and they March'd the next day. Major <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> desired Mr. <HI>Church</HI> with a commanded party consisting of <HI>English</HI> and some <HI>Friend-Indians.</HI> to March in the Front at some distance from the Main body. Their orders were to keep so far before, as not be in sight of the Army. And so they did, for by the way, they killed a Deer,
<PB N="5" REF="001800_0008_0FB82C17EBEC2018"/>flead, roasted, and eat the most of him before the Army came up, with them. But the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Forces soon arriv'd at <HI>Swanzey,</HI> and were posted at Major <HI>Browns</HI> and Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s Garrisons chiefly; and were there soon joyned with those that came from <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> who had entred into a Confederacy with their <HI>Plymouth</HI> Brethren, against the Perfidious Heathen.</P>
<P>The Enemy who began their Hostilities with plundring and destroying Cattel, did not long content themselves with that game. They thirsted for <HI>English</HI> blood, and they soon broach'd it; killing two Men in the way not far from Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s Garrison. And soon after, eight more at <HI>Matta∣piset:</HI> Upon whose bodies they exercised more than brutish barbarities; beheading, dis-membring and mangling them, and exposing them in the most inhumane manner, which gash'd and ghostly objects struck a damp on all beholders.</P>
<P>The Enemy flush'd with these exploits, grew yet bolder, and skulking every where in the busnes, shot at all Passengers, and kill'd many that ventured abroad. They came so near as to shoot down two Sentinels at Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>'s Garrison, under the very Noses of most of our Forces. These provocations drew out the resentments of some of Capt. <HI>Prentices</HI> Troop, who desired they might have liberty to go out and seek the Enemy in their own quarters. Quarter Masters <HI>Gill &amp; B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcher</HI> commanded the Parties drawn cut, who earnestly desired Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> company: They provided him a Horse and Furniture (his own being out of the way) he readily comply'd with their desires, and was soon Mounted.</P>
<P>This party were no sooner over <HI>Miles</HI>'s Bridge but were fired on by an Ambuscado of about a dozen <HI>Indians,</HI> as they were afterwards discovered to be. When they drew off the Pilot was Mortally wounded, Mr. <HI>Belcher</HI> re∣ceived a shot in his knee, and his Horse was kill'd under him, Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> was struck with a Musket-ball on the side of his belly; but being clad with a buff Coat and some thickness of Paper under it, it never broke his skin. The Troopers were surprized to see both their Commanders wounded, and wheel'd off. But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> perswaded, at length storm'd and stampt, and told them 'twas a shame to run, and leave a wounded Man there to be∣come a Prey to the barbarous Enemy. For the Pilot yet sat his Horse, tho' so maz'd with the Shot, as not to have sense to guide him. Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> second∣ed him, and offer'd, tho' much disenabled, to assist in bringing him of. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> asked a Stranger who gave them his company in that action, if he would go with him and fetch off the wounded Man: He readily con∣sented, they with Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> went, but the wounded Man fainted and fell off his Horse before they came to him; but Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and the Stranger dis∣mounted, took up the Man dead, and laid him before Mr. <HI>Gill</HI> on his Horse. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told the other two, if they would take care of the dead Man, he would go and fetch his Horse back, which was going off the Cassey toward
<PB N="6" REF="001800_0009_0FB82C1A90213A08"/>the Enemy; but before he got over the Eassey he saw the Enemy run to the right into the Neck. He brought back the Horse, and call'd earnestly and repeatedly to the Army to come over &amp; sight the Enemy; and while he Good calling &amp; perswading, the skulking Enemy return'd to their old stand, and all discharged their Guns as him at one clap, tho' every shot mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>him;</HI> yet one of the Army on the other side of the river received one of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls in his foot. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> now began (no succour coming to him) to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> it time to retreat: Saying, <HI>The Lord have Mercy on as,</HI> if such a handful of Indians shall thus dare such an Army.</P>
<P>Upon this 'twas immediately resolv'd, and orders were given to March down into the Neck, and having passed the Bridge, and Cassey, the directi∣on was to extend both wings, which being not well headed, by those that remain'd in the Center, some of them mistook their Friends for their Ene∣mies, and made a fire upon them on the right wing, and wounded that noble Heroick Youth Ensign <HI>Savage</HI> in the thigh; but it happily prov'd but a flesh wound. They Marched until they came to the narrow of the Neck, at a Place called <HI>Koekkamuit,</HI> where they took down the heads of Eight <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Men that were kill'd at the head of <HI>Metapoiset</HI>-Neck, and for upon Polls, after the barbarous manner of those salvages. There <HI>Philip</HI> had staved all his Drums, and conveyed all his Canoo's to the East side of <HI>Metapoiset</HI>-Ri∣ver. Hence it was concluded by those that were acquainted with the Mo∣tions of those People, that they had qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the Neck. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em that <HI>Philip</HI> was doubtless gone ever to <HI>Pocasset</HI> side, to ingage those Indians in Rebellion with him: which they soon found to be true. The Enemy were not really beaten out of <HI>Mount hope</HI> Neck, tho' 'twas true they fled from thence; yet it was before any pursu'd them. 'Twas but to strengthen themselves, and to gain a more advantagious Post. However, some and not a few pleased themselves with the fancy of a Mighty Conquest.</P>
<P>A grand Council was held, and a Resolve past, to build a Fort there to maintain the first ground they had gain'd, by the Indians leaving it to them. And to speak the Truth, it must be said, That as they gain'd not that Field, by their Sword, nor their Bow; so 'twas rather their fear than their courage, that oblig'd them to set up the marks of their Conquest Mr. <HI>Church</HI> look'd upon it, and talk of it with contempt, and urged hard the pursuing the Enemy on <HI>Pocasset</HI> side, and with the greater earnestness, because of his promise made to <HI>Awashonks,</HI> before mentioned. The Council adjourned themselves from <HI>Mount-hope</HI> to <HI>Reboboth,</HI> where Mr. Treasurer <HI>Southworth</HI> be∣ing weary of his charge of Commiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r General, (Provision being scarce &amp; difficult to be obtained, for the Army, that now lay still to Cover the Peo∣ple from no body, while they were building a Fort for nothing) retired, and the Power &amp; Trouble of that Pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was left with Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> who still urged the Commanding Officers to more over to <HI>Pocasset</HI> side, to pursue the Enemy,
<PB N="7" REF="001800_0010_0FB82C1BA8ACD780"/>and kill <HI>Philip,</HI> which would in his opinion be more probable to keep pos∣session of the Neck, than to tarry to build a Fort. He was still restless on that side of the River, and the rather because of his promise to the <HI>Squaw Sachem</HI> of <HI>Segkonate.</HI> And Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> also urged the same, until at length there came further order concerning the Fort. And with all, an order for Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> with Six files to cross the River to the side so much insisted on, and to try if he could get Speech with any of the <HI>Pocasset</HI> or <HI>Sogkonate</HI> In∣dians, and that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> should go his Second. Upon the Captains re∣ceiving his orders, he ask'd Mr. <HI>Church</HI> whither he was willing to engage in this interprize: To whom 'twas indeed too agreeable to be declined; tho' he thought the enterprize was hazardous enough, for them to have more Men assign'd them. Capt. <HI>Fuller</HI> told him that for his own part he was grown Ancient and heavy, he feared the travel and fatigue would be too much for him. But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> urged him, and told him, he would thearfully excuse him, his hardship and travel, and take that part to himself, if he might but go; for he had rather do any thing in the World than stay there to build the Fort.</P>
<P>Then they drew out the Number assigned them and March'd the same Night to the Ferry, and were transported to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> from whence the next Night they got a passage over to <HI>Pocasset</HI>-side in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Boats, and concluded there to dispose themselves in two Ambuscado's before day, ho∣ping to surprize some of the Enemy by their falling into one or other of their Ambusments. But Capt. <HI>Fullers</HI> party being troubled with the Epide∣mical plague of lust after Tobacco, must needs strike fire to Smoke it; and thereby discovered themselves to a party of the Enemy coming up to them, who immediately fled with great preciptation.</P>
<P>This Ambuscado drew off about break of day, perceiving they were dis∣cover'd, the other continued in their Post until the time assigned them, and the light and heat of the Sun rendred their Station both insignificant and troublesome, and then return'd, unto the place of Randezvous, where they were acquainted with the other parties disappointment, and the occasion of it. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> calls for the breakfast he had ordered to be brought o∣ver in the Boat: but the Man that had the charge of it confessed that he was a-sleep when the Boats-men called him, and in haste came away and never thought of it. It happened that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had a few Cakes of Rusk in his Pocket, that Madam <HI>Cranston</HI> (the Governour of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI>'s Lady) gave him, when he came off the Island, which he divided among the Com∣pany, which was all the Provisions they had.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> after their slender breakfast proposed to Capt. <HI>Fuller,</HI> That he would March in quest of the Enemy, with such of the Company as would be willing to March with him; which he complyed with, tho' with a great deal of scruple, because of his small Number, &amp; the extream hazard he fore∣saw must attend them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001800_0011_0FB82CADEC654BA0"/>
But some of the Company had reflected upon Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> that notwith∣standing his talk on the other side of the River, he had not shewn them any <HI>Indians</HI> since they came over. Which now mov'd him to tell them, That if it was their desire to see <HI>Indians,</HI> he believ'd he should now soon shew them what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould say was enough.</P>
<P>The Number allow'd him soon drew off to him, which could not be ma∣ny, because their whole Company consisted of no more than Thirty Six. They mov'd towards <HI>Sogkonate,</HI> until they came to the brook that runs into <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Neck, where they discovered a fresh and plain Track, which they concluded to be from the great Pine Swamp about a Mile from the Read that leads to <HI>Sogkonet.</HI> Now says Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to his Men, If we follow this Track no doubt but we shall soon see <HI>Indians</HI> enough; they express'd their willingness to follow the Track, and mov'd in it, but had not gone far be∣fore one of them narrowly escaped being bit with a <HI>Rattle-snake:</HI> And the Woods that the Track lead them through was haunted much with those Snakes; which the little Company seem'd more to be afraid of than the black Serpents they were in quest of, and therefore bent their course ano∣ther way; to a Place where they thought it probable to find some of the Enemy. Had they kept the Track to the Pine Swamp they had been cer∣tain of meeting <HI>Indians</HI> enough; but not so certain that any of them should have return'd to give account how many.</P>
<P>Now they pass'd down into <HI>Punkatees</HI> Neck; and in their March disco∣covered a large Wigwam full of <HI>Indian</HI> Truck, which the Souldiers were for loading themselves with; until Mr. <HI>Church</HI> forbid it; telling them they might expect soon to have their hands full, and business without caring for Plunder. Then crossing the head of the Creek into the Neck, they again discovered fresh, Indian Tracks, very larely pass'd before them into the Neck. They then got privately and undiscovered, unto the Fence of Capt. <HI>Almy's</HI> Pease-field and divided into two Parties, Mr. <HI>Church</HI> keeping the one Party with himself, sent the other with <HI>Lake</HI> that was acquainted with the ground, on the other side. Two <HI>Indians</HI> were soon discovered coming out of the Pease-field towards them: When Mr. <HI>Church</HI> &amp; those that were with him con∣cealed themselves from them, by falling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat on the ground: but the other division not using the same caution were seen by the Enemy, which occa∣sioned them to run; which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Mr. <HI>Church</HI> perceiv'd, he shew'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself to them, and call'd, telling them he desired but to speak with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and would not hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them.

<P><PB N="9" REF="001800_0012_0FB82CB0E83D4118"/>
Mr. <HI>Church</HI> then Marching over a plain piece of Ground where the Woods were very th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k on one side; order'd his little Company to March at dou∣ble distance, to make as big a show (if they should be discovered) as might be. But before they saw any body, they were Saluted with a Volly of fifty or sixty Guns; some Bullets came very surprizingly near Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> who starting, look'd behind him, to see what was become of his Men, expecting to have seen half of them dead, but seeing them all upon their Leggs and briskly firing at the Smokes of the Enemies Guns, (for that was all that was then to be seen) <HI>He Bless'd God, and called to his Men not to discharge all their Guns at o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, lest the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y should take the advantage of such an opportunity to run upon them with their H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tches.</HI></P>
<P>Their next Motion was immediately into the Pease field. When they came to the Fence Mr <HI>Church</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d as many as had not discharg'd their Guns, to clap under the Fence, and lye close, while the other at some distance in the Field flood to charge; hoping that if the Enemy should creep to the Fence to gain a shot at those that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arging their Guns, they might be surprized by those that lay under the Fence. But casting his Eyes to the side of the Hill above them; the hill seem'd to move, being covered over with <HI>Indians,</HI> with their bright Guns glittering in the Sun, and running in a circumference with a design to surround them.</P>
<P>Seeing such Multitudes surrounding him and his little Company; it put him upon thinking what was become of the Boats that were ordered to attend him: And looking up, he spy'd them a-shore at <HI>Sandy-point</HI> on the Island side of the River, with a number of Horse and Foot by them, and wondred what should be the occasion; until he was afterwards informed, That the Boats had been over that Morning from the Island and had land∣ed a Party of Men at <HI>Fogland,</HI> that were design'd in <HI>Punkatees</HI> Neck to fetch off some Cattel and Horses, but were Ambuscado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and many of them wounded by the Enemy.</P>
<P>Now our Gentlemans Courage and Conduct were both put to the Test, the incourages his Men; and orders some to run and take a Wall to shelter before the Enemy gain'd it. Twas time for them now to think of escaping if they knew which way. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> orders his Men to strip to their white Shirts, that the <HI>Islanders</HI> might discover them to be English Men; &amp; then orders Three Guns to be fired distinct, hoping it might be observ'd by their friends on the opposite Shore. The Men that were ordered to take the Wall being very hungry, stop'd a while among the Pease to gather a few, being about four Rod from the Wall; the Enemy from behind it hail'd them with a Shower of Bullets; but soon all but one came tumbling over an old hedge down the bank where Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and the rest were, and told him that his Brother <HI>B. Southworth,</HI> who was the Man that was missing, was kill'd, that they saw him fall; and so they did indeed see him fall, but 'twas without a
<PB N="10" REF="001800_0013_0FB82CB3A1ECA1A0"/>Shot, and lay no longer than till he had opportunity to clap a Bullet into one of the Enemies Forehead, and then came running to his Company. The meanness of the <HI>English</HI>'s Powder was now their greatest misfortune; when they were immediately upon this bese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Multitudes of <HI>Indians,</HI> who possessed themselves of every Rock, Stump, Tree, or Fence that was in sight, firing upon them without ceasing; while they had no other shelter but a small bank &amp; bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a water Fence. And yet to add to the disadvan∣tage of this little handful of distressed Men; The <HI>Indians</HI> also possessed them∣selves of the Ruines of a Stone-house that over look'd them, and of the black Rocks to the Southward of them; so that now they had no way to prevent lying quite open to some, or other of the Enemy, but to heap up Stones before them, as they did, and still bravely and wonderfully defended them∣selves, against all the numbers of the Enemy. At length came over one of the Boats from the Island Shore, but the Enemy ply'd their Shot so warmly to her as made her keep at some distance; Mr. <HI>Church</HI> desired them to send their Canoo a-shore to fetch them on board; but no perswasions, nor ar∣guments could prevail with them to bring their Canoo to shore. Which some of Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> Men perceiving, began to cry out, <HI>For God's sake to take them off, for their Ammunition was spent,</HI> &amp;c. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> being sensible of the danger of the Enemies hearing their Complaints, and being made acquain∣ted with the weakness and scantiness of their Ammunition, fiercely called to the Boats-master, and bid either send his Canoo a-shore, or else begone presently, or he would fire upon him.</P>
<P>Away goes the Boat and leaves them still to shift for themselves. But then another difficulty arose; the Enemy seeing the Boat leave them, were re∣animated &amp; fired thicker &amp; faster than ever; Upon which some of the Men that were lightest of foot, began to talk of attempting an escape by flight: until Mr. <HI>Church</HI> sollidly convinc'd them of the impracticableness of it; and incouraged them yet, told them, <HI>That be had observ'd so much of the remarka∣ble and wonderful Providence of God hitherto preserving them, that incouraged him to believe with much confidence th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed would yet preserve them; that not a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of their head should fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ground; bid them be Patient, Couragious and Pru∣dently sparing of their Ammunition, and be made no doubt but they should come well off yet,</HI> &amp;c until his little Army, again resolve one and all to stay with, and stick by him. One of them by Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> order was pitching a flat Stone up an end before him in the Sand, when a Bullet from the Enemy with a full force stroke the Stone while he was pitching it an end; which put the poor fellow to a miserable start, till Mr. <HI>Church</HI> call'd upon him to observe, <HI>How God directed the Bullets that the Enemy could not hit him when in the same place, yet could hit the Stone as it was erected.</HI></P>
<P>While they were thus making the best defence they could against their numerous Enemies that made the Woods ring with their constant yelling
<PB N="11" REF="001800_0014_0FB82CB54F239088"/>and shouting: And Night coming on, some body told Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> they spy'd a Sloop up the River as far as <HI>Gold-Island,</HI> that seemed to be coming down towards them: He look'd up and told them <HI>Succour was now coming, for he believ'd it was Capt.</HI> Golding, <HI>whom he knew to be a Man for business; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld certainly fetch them off, if be came:</HI> the Wind being fair, the Vessel was soon with them; and Capt. <HI>Golding</HI> it was. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> (as soon as they came to Speak one with another) desired him <HI>to come to Aneber at such a distance from the Shore that be might veer out his Cable and ride a float, and let slip his Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that is might drive ash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re;</HI> which directions Capt. <HI>Golding</HI> observ'd, but the Enemy gave him such a warm Salute, that his Sail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Colour, and Stern were full of Bullet holes.</P>
<P>The Canoo came ashore, but was so small that she would not bare a∣bove two Mea at a time; and when two were got aboard, they turn'd her loose to drive ashore for two more: and the Sloops company kept the <HI>Indians</HI> in play the while. But when at last it came to Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> turn to go aboard, he had left his Hat and Cutlash at the Well where he went to drink when he fist came down; he told his Company, <HI>He would never go off and leave his Hat and Cutlash for the</HI> Indians; <HI>they should never have that to reflect upon him.</HI> Tho 'he was much diffwaded from it, yet he would go fetch them. He put all the Powder he had left into his Gun (and a poor charge it was) and went presenting his Gun at the Enemy, until he took up what he went for; at his return be discharged his Gun at the Enemy to bid them farewel, for that time; but had not Powder enough to carry the Bullet half way to them.</P>
<P>Two Bullets from the Enemy stuck the Canoo as he went on Board, one grazed the hair of his Head a little before; another struck in a small Stake that stood right against the middle of his Breast.</P>
<P>Now this Gentleman with his Army, making in all 20 Men, himself, and his Pilot being numbred with them, got all safe aboard after Six hours in∣gagement with 300 <HI>Indians;</HI> whose N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber we were told afterwards by some of themselves. <HI>A deliverance which that good Gentleman often mentions to the Glory of God, and His Protecting Providence.</HI> The next day meeting with the rest of their little Company whom he had left at <HI>Pocasset,</HI> (that had also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> small skirmish with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and had two Men Wounded) they return'd to the <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Garrison; which Mr. <HI>Church</HI> us'd to call the loosing Fort. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> then returning to the Island to seek Provision for the Army, meets with <HI>Alderman,</HI> a noted <HI>Indian</HI> that was just come over from the <HI>Squaw Sachem</HI>'s Cape of <HI>Pocasset,</HI> having deserted from her, and had brought over his Family: Who gave him an account of the State of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and where each of the <HI>Sagamo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> head quarters were. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> then discours'd with some who knew the Spot well where the <HI>Indians</HI> said <HI>Weetamores</HI> head quarters were, and offered their Service to Pilot him. With this News he
<PB N="12" REF="001800_0015_0FB82CB89FE14528"/>hastned to the <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Garrison. The Army express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their readiness to imbrace such an opportunity.</P>
<P>All the ablest Souldiers were now immediately drawn off equip'd &amp; dis∣patch'd upon this design, under the Command of a certain Officer: and having March'd about two Miles, <HI>viz.</HI> until they came to the Cove that lyes <HI>S.

The Com∣mander in Chief told them he thought it proper to take advice before he went any further; called Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and the Pilot, and ask'd them. <HI>How they knew that</HI> Philip <HI>and all his Men were not by that time got to</HI> Weetamores <HI>Camp; or that all her own Men were not by that time return'd to her again?</HI> With many more frightful questions.

Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> one <HI>Baxter</HI> and Capt. <HI>Hunter</HI> an Indian, profer'd to go out on the discovery on the left Wing; which was accepted; they had not March'd above a quarter of a Mile before they started Three of the Enemy. Capt, <HI>Hunter</HI> wounded one of them in his knee, whom when he came up he dis∣covered to be his near kinsman; the Captive desired favour for his <HI>Squaw,</HI> if she should fall into their hands, but ask'd none for himself, excepting the liberty of taking a Whiff of Tobacco, and while he was taking his Whiff, his kinsman with one blow of his Hatchet dispatch'd him. Proceeding to <HI>Weetamores</HI> Camp, they were discover'd by one of the Enemy, who ran in and gave Information; upon which a lusty Young Fellow lest his Meat upon his Spit, running ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ily out told his companions, <HI>he would kill an Eng∣lish man before he eat his dinner:</HI> but fail'd of his design, being no sooner out but shot down. The Enemies sires, and what shelter they had was by the Edge of a thick Cedar Swamp, into which on this Alarm they betook them∣selves; and the English as nimbly pursued; but were soon commanded back by their Chieftain after they were come within hearing of the Crys of their Women, and Children, and so ended that Exploit. But returning to their Sloop the Enemy pursued them and wounded two of their Alen. The next day return'd to the <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Garrison.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001800_0016_0FB82CBCB188A618"/>
Soon after this, was <HI>Philips</HI> head Quarters visited by some other <HI>English</HI> Forces; but <HI>Philip</HI> and his gang had the very fortune to escape that <HI>Wee∣tamore</HI> and hers (but now mentioned) had: they took into a Swamp and their pursuers were commanded back. After this <HI>Dartmouths</HI> distresses re∣quired Succour, great Part of the Town being laid desolate, and many of the Inhabitants kill'd; the most of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Forces were order'd thither: And coming to <HI>Russels</HI> Garrison at <HI>Poneganset,</HI> they met with a Number of the Enemy that had surrendred themselves Prisoners on terms promised by Capt. <HI>Eels</HI> of the Garrison; and <HI>Ralph Earl</HI> that perswaded them (by a friend <HI>Indian</HI> he had employed) to come in. And had their promises to the <HI>Indians</HI> been kept, and the <HI>Indians</HI> farely treated, 'tis probable that most if not all the <HI>Indians</HI> in those Parts, had soon followed the Example of those that had now surrendred themselves; which would have been a good step towards finishing the War. But in spite of all that Capt. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, Church,</HI> or <HI>Earl</HI> could say, argue, plead, or beg, some body else that had more Power in their hands improv'd it; and without any regard to the promises made them on their surrendring themselves, they were carry'd away to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> there sold, and transported out of the Country; being about Eight-score Persons. An action so hateful to Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> that he oppos'd it to the loss of the good will and Respects of some that before were his good Friends. But while these things were acting at <HI>Dartmouth, Philip</HI> made his escape, leaving his Country, fled over <HI>Taunton</HI>-River, and <HI>Reboboth</HI>-Plain, and <HI>Petuxet</HI>-River, where Capt <HI>Edmunds</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> made some spoil upon; and had proba∣bly done more, but was prevented by the coming up of a Superiour Officer, that put him by. And now another Fort was built at <HI>Pocasset,</HI> that prov'd a troublesome and chargeable as that at <HI>Mount-hope;</HI> and the remainder of the Summer was improv'd in providing for the Forts and Forces there maintained, while our Enemies were fled some hundreds of Miles into the Country, near as far as <HI>Albany.</HI> And now strong Suspicions began to arise of the <HI>Narraganset Indians,</HI> that they were ill affected, and designed mischief; and so the event soon discovered. The next Winter they began their Hosti∣lities, upon the <HI>English.</HI> The United Colonies then agreed to sent an Ar∣my to suppress them: Governour <HI>Winslow</HI> to command the Army.

Having rid with the General to <HI>Boston,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Reboboth.</HI> Upon the Generals request he went thence the nearest way over the Ferries, with Major <HI>Smith</HI> to his Garrison in the <HI>Narraganset Country,</HI> to prepare and pro∣vide for the coming of General <HI>Winslow;</HI> who March'd round thro' the Country with his Army proposing by Night to surprize <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mham</HI> a certain <HI>Narraganset</HI> Sachem) and his Town; but being aware of the approach of
<PB N="14" REF="001800_0017_0FB82CBDA9E3A200"/>our Army made their escape into the desarts. But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> meeting with fair Winds arriv'd safe at the Major's Garrison in the evening. And soon began to inquire after the Enemies Resorts, Wigwams or Sleeping Places; and having gain'd some intelligence, he proposed to the <HI>Eldriges,</HI> and some other brisk hands, that he met with, to attempt the Surprizing of some of the Enemy to make a Present of to the General, when he should arrive: which might advantage his design; being brisk blades, they readily com∣ply'd with the motion, and were soor upon their March. The Night was very cold, but bless'd with the <HI>Moon;</HI> before the day broke they effected their exploit, and by the rising of the Sun arrived at the Major's Garrison, where they met the General and presented him with Eighteen of the Enemy they had Captiv'd. The General pleas'd with the exploit, gave them thanks, particularly to Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> the mover and chief actor of the business; and sending two of them (likely Boys) a present to <HI>Boston;</HI> smiling on Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> told him, <HI>That he made no doubt but his Faculty would supply them with</HI> Indian Boys <HI>enough before the War was ended.</HI></P>
<P>Their next move was to a Swamp which the <HI>Indians</HI> had Fortifyed with a Fort. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> rid in the Generals guard when the bloudy ingage∣ment began; but being impatient of being out of the heat of the action, importunately beg'd leave of the General that he might run down to the assistance of his friends, the General yielded to his request, provided he could rally some hands to go with him. Thirty Men immediately drew out and followed him: They entred the Swamp and passed over the Log, that was the passage into the Fort, where they saw many Men and several Valiant Captains lye slain: Mr. <HI>Church</HI> spying Capt. <HI>Gardner</HI> of <HI>Salem</HI> amidst the Wigwams in the East end of the Fort, made towards him, but on a sudden, while they were looking each other in the Face, Capt. <HI>Gardner</HI> settled down, Mr. <HI>Church</HI> step'd to him and seeing the blood run down his cheek lifted up his Cap and calling him by his Name; he look'd up in his Face, but spoke not a Word, being Mortally Shot thro' the head; and observing his Wound, Mr. <HI>Church</HI> found the ball entred his head on the side that was next the Up∣land, where the <HI>English</HI> entred the Swamp. Upon which, having ordered some care to be taken of the Captain, he dispatch'd information to the Ge∣neral that the best and forwardest of his Army that hazarded their lives to enter the Fort, upon the muzzle of the Enemies Guns, were Shot in their backs, and kill'd by them that lay behind. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> with his small Com∣pany hasten'd out of the Fort (that the <HI>English</HI> were now possessed of) to get a Shot at the <HI>Indians</HI> that were in the Swamp, &amp; kept firing upon them. He soon met with a broad bloody track, where the Enemy had fled with their Wounded men; following hard in the tract, he soon spy'd one of the Enemy, who clap'd his Gun a-cross his breast, made towards Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> and beckned to him with his hand; Mr. <HI>Church</HI> immediately commanded

But immediately they heard a great shout of the Enemy, which seem'd to be behind them, or between them and the Fort; and discover'd them running from tree to tree to gain advantages of firing upon the <HI>English</HI> that were in the Fort. Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> great diffi∣culty now was how to discover himself to his Friends in the Fort, using se∣veral inventions, till at length gain'd an opportunity to call to, and inform a Serjeant in the Fort, that he was there, and might be exposed to their Shots, unless they observ'd it. By this time he discovered a number of the Enemy almost within Shot of him, making towards the Fort; Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and his Company were favoured by a heap of brush that was between them and the Enemy, and prevented their being discover'd to them. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had given his Men their particular orders for firing upon the Enemy; and as they were rising up to make their Shot, the afore mentioned Serjeant in the Fort called out to them, <HI>for God's sake not to fire, for be believed they were some of their</HI> Friend Indians; they clap'd down again, but were soon sensi∣ble of the Serjeants mistake. The Enemy got to the top of the Tree, the body whereof the Serjeant stood upon, and there clap'd down out of sight of the Fort, but all this while never discovered Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> who observed them to keep gathering unto that Place, until there seem'd to be a formi∣dable black heap of them. <HI>Now brave boys</HI> (said Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to his Men) <HI>if we mind our bits, we may have a brave Shot, and let our sign for firing on them, be their rising up to fire into the Fort.</HI> It was not long before the <HI>Indians</HI> rising up as one body, designing to pour a Volley into the Fort. When our <HI>Church</HI> nimbly started up and gave them such a round Volley, and unex∣pected clap on their backs, that they who escaped with their Lives, were so surprized, that they scampered, they knew not whether themselves; about a dozen of them ran right over the Log into the Fort, and took into a sort of a Hovel that was build with Poles, after the manner of a corn crib. Mr. <HI>Church</HI>'s Men having their Catteridges fix'd, were soon ready to obey his order, which was immediately to charge and run on upon the Hovel, and over-set it, calling as he run on to some that were in the Fort to assist him in over-setting of it; they no sooner came to Face the Enemies shelter, but Mr. <HI>Church</HI> discover'd that one of them had found a hole to point his Gun through, right at him; but however incouraged his Company, and ran right on, till he was struck with Three Bullets, one in his Thigh, which was near half of it cut off as it glanced on the joynt of the Hip-bone; a∣nother thro' the gatherings of his Breeches and Draws, with a small flesh Wound; a third peirced his Pocket, and wounded a pair of Mittins, that he had borrowed of Capt. <HI>Prentice;</HI> being wrap'd up together had the mis∣fortune

And more-over, that the Army had no other Provision to trust unto or depend upon; that be knew that</HI> Plymouth <HI>Forces had not so much as one Biscake L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft, for be bad seen their last dealt out,</HI> &amp;c. The General advising a few Words with the Gentlemen that were about him, Mov'd towards the Fort, designing to ride in himself, and bring in the whole Army. But just as he was entring the Swamp, one of his Captains meet him, and asked him, <HI>Whither he was going?</HI> He told him into the Fort; the Captain laid hold of his Horse, and told him, <HI>His Life was worth an bundred of theirs, and he should not expose himself.</HI> The General told him, <HI>That he supposed the brunt was over, and that Mr.</HI> Church <HI>had inform'd him that the Fort was taken,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And as the case was circumstanced he was of the Mind, that it was most practicable for him, and his Army to shelter themselves in the Fort.</HI> The Captain in a great heat, reply'd, <HI>That Church ly'd;</HI> and told the General, <HI>That if he mov'd another step towards the Fort he would shoot his Horse under him.</HI> Then brusled up another Gentleman, a certain Doctor, and opposs'd Mr. <HI>Chureh's</HI> advice, and said, <HI>If it were comply'd with, it would kill more Men than the Enemy had killed; for</HI> (said he) <HI>by to Morrow the wounded Men will be so stiff that there will be no moving of them:</HI> And looking upon Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> and seeing the blood flow∣ing a pace from his Wounds, told him, <HI>That if he gave such advice as that was, he should bleed to Death like a Dog, before they would endeavour to stench his blood</HI> Though after they had prevailed against his advice, they were suffi∣ciently kind to him. And burning up all the Houses and Provisions in the Fort; the Army return'd the same Night in the Storm and Cold: And I Suppose every one that is acquainted with the circumstances of that Nights March, deeply laments the miseries that attended them, especially the
<PB N="17" REF="001800_0020_0FB82CC2C7924350"/>wounded &amp; dying Men. But it mercifully came to pass that Capt. <HI>Andrew Belcher</HI> arrived at Mr. <HI>Smiths</HI> that very Night from <HI>Boston,</HI> with a Vessel loaden with Provisions for the Army, who must otherwise have perish'd for want Some of the Enemy that were then in the Fort have since inform'd as, that near a third of the <HI>Indians</HI> belonging to all that <HI>Narraganset Country</HI> were killed by the <HI>English,</HI> and by the Cold that Night, that they fled out of their Fort so hastily that they carried nothing with them: that if the <HI>English</HI> had kept in the Fort, the <HI>Indians</HI> had certainly been necessitated, either to surrender themselves to them, or to have perished by Hunger, and the severity of the Season. Some time after this Fort-sight a certain <HI>Sog∣honate Indian</HI> hearing Mr. <HI>Church</HI> relate the manner of his being wounded, told him, <HI>That he did not know but he himself was the</HI> Indian <HI>that wounded him, for that he was one of that company of</HI> Indians <HI>that Mr.</HI> Church <HI>made a Shot up∣on when they were rising up to make a Shot into the Fort; they were in number a∣bout 60 or 70, that just then came down from</HI> Pumhams <HI>Town, and never before then fired a Gun against the</HI> English; <HI>that when Mr.</HI> Church <HI>fired upon them he killed 14 dead in the Spot, and wounded a greater number than he killed, many of which dyed afterwards with their wounds, in the Cold and Storm the following Night.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was mov'd with other wounded men over to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> where in about a Months time he was in some good measure recovered of his Wounds, and the Fever that attended them. And then went over to the General to take his leave of him, with a design to return home.</P>
<P>But the Generals great importunity again perswaded him, to accompany him in a long March, into the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> Country, tho' he had then Tents in his Wounds, and so Lame as not able to Mount his Horse without two Mens assistance.</P>
<P>In this March the first thing remarkable was, they came to an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, where there were many <HI>Wigwams</HI> in sight, but an Icy Swamp ly∣ing between them and the <HI>Wigwams,</HI> prevented their running at once upon it as they intended: there was much firing upon each side before they pass'd the Swamp. But at length the Enemy all fled, and a certain <HI>Moobegan</HI> that was a friend <HI>Indian,</HI> pursued and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d one of the Enemy that had a small wound in his Leg, and brought him before the General, where he was examined. Some were for torturing of him to bring him to a more ample confession, of what he knew concerning his Country-men. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> verily believing he had been ingenious in his confession, interceeded and prevailed for his escaping torture. But the Army being bound forward in their March, and the <HI>Indians</HI> wound somewhat disinabling him for Tra∣velling, 'twas concluded he should be knock'd on the Head: Accordingly he was brought before a great fire, and the <HI>Moobegan</HI> that took him was allowed, as he desired, to be the Executiner. Mr.<HI>Church</HI> taking no delight
<PB N="18" REF="001800_0021_0FB82CC4A4D9AF70"/>in the Sport, fram'd an arrant at some distance among the baggage Horses, and when he had got some Ten Rods, or thereabouts from the fire, the Executioner fetching a blow with his Hatchet at the head of the Prisoner, he being aware of the blow, dodged his aside, and the Executioner missing his stroke the Hatchet slew out of his hand, and had like to have done ex∣ecution where 'twas not design'd. The Prisoner upon his narrow escape broke from them that held him, and notwithstanding his Wound made use of his Legs, and hap'd to run right upon Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> who laid hold on him, and a close skuffle they had, but the <HI>Indian</HI> having no Clothes on slip'd from him, and ran again, and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> pursued the <HI>Indian,</HI> altho' being Lame, there was no great odds in the Race, until the <HI>Indian</HI> stumbled and fell, and they closed again, skuffled and sought pretty smartly, until the <HI>Indian</HI> by the advantage of his nakedness slip'd from his hold again, and set out on his third Race, with Mr. <HI>Church</HI> close at his heels, endeavouring to lay hold on the hair of his Head, which was all the hold could be taken of him; and running thro' a Swamp that was covered with hollow Ice, it made so loud a noise that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> expected (but in vain) that some of his <HI>English</HI> friends would follow the noise, and come to his assistance. But the <HI>Indian</HI> hap'd to run a-thwart a mighty Tree that lay fallen near breast-high, where he stop'd, and cry'd out a loud for help; but Mr. <HI>Church</HI> being soon upon him again, the <HI>Indian</HI> seized him fast by the hair of his Head, and endeavouring by twisting to break his Neck; but tho' Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> wounds had some-what weakned him, and the <HI>Indian</HI> a stout fellow, yet he held him well in play, and twisted the <HI>Indians</HI> Neck as well, and took the advantage of many opportunities, while they hung by each others hair gave him noto∣rious bunts in the face with his head. But in the heat of this skuffle they heard the Ice break with some bodies coming a-pace to them, which when they heard, <HI>Church</HI> concluded there was help for one or other of them, but was doubtful which of them must now receive the fatal stroke; anon some body comes up to them, who prov'd to be the Indian that had first taken the Prisoner. Without speaking a word, he felt them out (for 'twas so dark he could not distinguish them by sight) the one being clothed, and the other naked, he felt where Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> hands were fastned in the Ne∣tops hair, and with one blow settled his Hatchet in between them, and end∣ed the strife. He then spoke to Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and hugg'd him in his Arms, and thank'd him abundantly for catching his Prisoner; and cut off the head of his Victim, and carried it to the Camp, and giving an account to the rest of the friend Indians in the Camp, how Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had seized his Prisoner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they all joyn'd a mighty shout.</P>
<P>Proceeding in this March, they had the success of killing many of the Enemy: until at length their Provision failing, they return'd home.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> (as was before hinted) was fled to a Place called <HI>Scattacook,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001800_0022_0FB82CC75FFB7448"/>between <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> where the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bags</HI> made a descent upon him and killed many of his Men, which moved him from thence.</P>
<P>His next kennelling Place was at the falls of Connecticut River, where sometime after Capt. <HI>Turner</HI> found him, came upon him by Night, kill'd him a great many Men, and frighted many more into the River, that were hurl'd down the falls and drowned.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> got over the River, and on the back side of the <HI>Wetuset-hills</HI> meets with all the Remnants of the <HI>Narraganset</HI> and <HI>Nipmuck Indians,</HI> that were there gathered together, and became very numerous; and made their descent on <HI>Sudbury,</HI> and the Adjacent Parts of the Country, where they met with and swallowed up Valiant Capt. <HI>Wadsworth</HI> and his Company, and many other doleful desolations, in those Parts. The News whereof coming to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and they expecting probably the Enemy would soon return again into their Colony: The Council of War were called together; and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was sent for to them, being observed by the whole Colony to be a Person extraordinarily qualify'd for and adapted to the Affairs of War. Twas proposed in Council that least the Enemy in their return should fall on <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> or some other of their Out-Towns, a Company consisting of 60 or 70 Men should be sent in to those Parts; and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> invited to take the Command of them. He told them, <HI>That if the Enemy returned into that Colony again, they might reasonably expect that they would come very numerous; and that if be should take the Command of Men, he should not lye in any Town or Garrison with them, but would lye in the Woods as the Enemy did: And that to send out such small Companies against such Multitudes of the Enemy that were now Mustered together, would be but to deliver so many Men into their hands, to be de∣stroyed, as the Worthy Capt.</HI> Wadsworth <HI>and his Company were.</HI> His advice up∣on the whole was. That if they sent out any Forces, to send not less than 300 Souldiers; and that the other Colonies should be ask'd to send out their <HI>Quota's</HI> also; adding, <HI>That if they intended to make an end of the War, by subduing the Enemy, they must make a business of the War, as the Enemy did; and that for his own part, he had wholly laid aside all his own private business and con∣cerns, ever since the War broke out.</HI> He told them, <HI>That if they would send forth such Forces as he should direct to, he would go with them for Six weeks March, which was long enough for Men to be kept in the Woods at once; and if they might be sure of Liberty to return in such a space, Men would go out chearfully. And he would engage</HI> 150 <HI>of the hest Souldiers should immediately List Voluntarily to go with him, if they would please to add</HI> 50 <HI>more; and</HI> 100 <HI>of the Friend Indians; and with such on Army he made no doubt but he might do good Service; but on other terms he did not incline to be concern'd.</HI></P>
<P>Their reply was, That they were already in debt, and so big an Army would bring such charge upon them, that they should never be able to pay. And as for sending out <HI>Indians,</HI> they thought it no wayes advisable, and in short, none of his advice practicable.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001800_0023_0FB82CCAC3B19A38"/>
Now Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> Consort, and his then only Son were till this time remaining at <HI>Duxborough,</HI> and his fearing their safety there (unless the War were more vigorously ingaged in) resolved to move to <HI>Rhode-Island;</HI> tho' it was much opposed both by the Government, and by Relations But at length, the Governour considering that he might be no less Serviceable by being on that side of the Colony, gave his permit, and wish'd he had Twenty more as good Men to send with him.</P>
<P>Then preparing for his Removal, he went with his small Family to <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> to take leave of their Friends; where they met with his Wives Pa∣rents, who much perswaded that She might be left at Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> Garrison, (which they supposed to be a mighty safe Place) or at least that She might be there until her soon expected lying-inn was over (being near her time.) Mr. <HI>Church</HI> no ways inclining to venture her any longer in those Parts, and no arguments prevailing with him he resolutely set out for <HI>Taurton,</HI> and many of their Friends accompanyed them. There they found Capt. <HI>Peirce,</HI> with a commanded Party, who offered Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to send a Relation of his with some others to guard him to <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> thank'd him for his Respectful offer, but for some good reasons refus'd to accept it. In short, they got safe to Capt. <HI>John Almy</HI>'s house upon <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> where the met with friends and good entertainment. But by the way, let me not forget this remarkable Providence. <HI>viz.</HI> That within Twenty-four hours or there abouts, after their arrival at <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> Garrison that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was so much importuned to leave his Wife and Child at, was destroyed by the Enemy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> being at present disinabled from any particular Service in he War, began to think of some other employ; but he no sooner took a tool to cut a small stick, but he cut off the top of his Fore finger, and the next to it, half off; upon which he smillingly said, That he thought he was out of his way, to leave the War; and resolved he would to War again. Ac∣cordingly his Second Son being born on the 12th of <HI>May</HI> and his Wife &amp; Son like to do well, Mr. <HI>Church</HI> imbraces the opportunity of a passage in a Sloop bound to <HI>Barnstabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> who landed him at <HI>Sogkon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sset,</HI> from whence he rid to <HI>Plymouth;</HI> arrived there on the first Tuesday in <HI>June:</HI> The General Court then sitting, welcom'd him told him they were glad to see him Alive. He reply'd, He was as glad to see them Alive, for he had seen so many fires and smokes towards their side of the Country since he left them, that he could scarce eat or sleep with any comfort, for fear they had been all de∣stroyed. For all Travelling was stop'd, and no News had passed for a long time together. He gave them account, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had made horrid desolations at <HI>Providence, Warwick, Petuxit,</HI> and all over the <HI>Narra anset</HI> Coun∣try, &amp; that they prevailed daily against the <HI>English</HI> on that side of the Coun∣try. Told them, he long'd to hear what Methods they design'd in the War.
<PB N="21" REF="001800_0024_0FB82CCC4CD78578"/>They told him, They were particularly glad that Providence had brought him there at that juncture: For they had concluded the very next day to send out an Army of 200 Men, two third <HI>English,</HI> and one third <HI>Indians,</HI> in some measure agreeable to his former proposal; expecting <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> to joyn with their <HI>Quota's.</HI> In short, It was so concluded. And that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> should return to the <HI>Island,</HI> and see what he could Muster there, of those that had mov'd from <HI>Swanz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, Dartmouth,</HI> &amp;c. So re∣turning the same way he came; when he came to <HI>Sogkonesset,</HI> he had a sham put upon him, about a Boat he had bought to go home in; and was forced to hire two of the friend Indians to paddle him in a Canoo from <HI>Elsabeths</HI> to <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI></P>
<P>It fell out that as they were in their Voyage passing by <HI>Sogkonate-point,</HI> some of the Enemy were upon the Rocks a fishing; he bid the <HI>Indians</HI> that managed the Canoo to paddle so near to the Rocks as that he might call to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <HI>Indians;</HI> told them. That he had a great mind ever since the War broke out to speak with some of the <HI>Sogkonate Indians,</HI> and that they were their Relations, and therefore they need not fear their hurting of them. And he added, <HI>That he had a mighty conceit that if be could gain a fair Opportu∣nity to discourse them, that he could draw them off from</HI> Philip, <HI>for he knew they never heartily loved him.</HI> The Enemy hollowed and made signs for the Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo to come to them: But when they approach'd them they skulked and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hid in the clifts of the Rocks; then Mr. <HI>Church</HI> ordered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Canoo to be paddled off again, least if he came too near they should sire upon him. Then the <HI>Indians</HI> appearing again, beckn'd and call'd in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and bid them come a-shore, they wanted to speak with them. The <HI>Indians</HI> in the Canoo answered them again; but they on the Rocks told them, That the surff made such a noise against the Rocks, they could not hear any thing they said. Then Mr. <HI>Church</HI> by signs with his hands, gave to understand, That he would have two of them go down upon the point of the beach (a place where a Man might see who was near him) accordingly two of them ran a-long the beach, and met him there; without their Arms excepting that one of them had a Lance in his hand; they uged Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to come a-shore for they had a great desire to have some discourse with him; He told them, if he that had his weapon in his hand would carry it up some distance upon the beach and leave it, he would come a-shore and discourse them: He did so, and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> went a-shore, halled up his Canoo, or∣dered one of his <HI>Indians</HI> to stay by it, and the other to walk above on the beach, as a Sentinel to see that the Coasts were clear. And when Mr. <HI>Church</HI> came up to the <HI>Indians,</HI> one of them happened to be honest <HI>George,</HI> one of the two that <HI>Awashonks</HI> formerly sent to call him to her Dance, and was so careful to guard him back to his House again; the last <HI>Sogkonate Indian</HI> he spoke with before the War broke out; he spoke <HI>English</HI> very well.
<PB N="22" REF="001800_0025_0FB82CCD789FCDC8"/>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> asked him where <HI>Awashonks</HI> was? he told him in a Swamp about three Miles off. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> again asked him, What it was he wanted that he hollowed and called him a-shore? he answered, That he took him for <HI>Church</HI> as soon as he heard his Voice in the Canoo, and that he was very glad to see him alive, and he believed his Mistriss would be as glad to see him, and speak with him; he told him further, That he believed she was not fond of maintaining a War with the <HI>English;</HI> and that she had left <HI>Philip,</HI> and did not intend to return to him any more; he was mighty ear∣nest with Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to tarry there while he would run and call her: but he told him no; for he did not know but the <HI>Indians</HI> would come down and kill him before he could get back again; he said, if <HI>Mount-hope</HI> or <HI>Pocesset Indians</HI> could catch him, he believed they would knock him on the head: But all <HI>Sogkonate Indians</HI> knew him very well, and he believed would none of them hurt him. In short, Mr. <HI>Church</HI> refused then to tarry, but promised that he would come over again, and speak with <HI>Awashonks,</HI> and some other <HI>Indians</HI> that he had a mind to talk with.</P>
<P>Accordingly he appointed him to notifie <HI>Awashonks,</HI> her Son <HI>Peter,</HI> their Chief Captain and one <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pash</HI> (an <HI>Indian</HI> that Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had formerly a particular respect for) to meet him two dayes after, at a Rock at the lower end of Capt. <HI>Richmonds</HI> Farm; which was a very noted place; and if that day should prove Stormy, or Windy, they were to expect him the next moderate day. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> telling <HI>George,</HI> that he would have him come with the Persons mentioned, and no more. They giving each other their hand upon it parted, and Mr. <HI>Church</HI> went home, and the next Morning to <HI>New port,</HI> and informed the Government, what had passed between him and the <HI>Sogkonate Indians.</HI> And desired their permit for him and <HI>Daniel Wilcock,</HI> (a Man that well understood the <HI>Indian</HI> Language) to go over to them. They told him, They thought he was mad, after such Service <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he had done, and such dangers that he escaped, now to throw away his Life, for the Rogues would as certainly kill him, as ever he went over; and utterly refused to grant his permit, or to be willing that he should run the risque.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told them, <HI>That it had ever been in his thoughts since the War broke out, that if he could discourse the</HI> Sogkonate Indians, <HI>he could draw them off from</HI> Philip, <HI>and employ them against him; but could, till now, never have an Opportu∣nity to speak with any of them, and was very lothe to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se it,</HI> &amp;c. At length, they told him, If he would go, it should be only with the two <HI>Indians</HI> that came with him; but they would give him no permit under their hands. He took his leave of them, Resolving to prosecute his design; they told him they were sorry to see him so Resolute, nor if he went did they ever expect to see his face again.</P>
<P>He bought a Bottle of Rhum, and a small role of Tobacco, to carry with him, and returned to his Family. The next Morning, being the day ap∣pointed
<PB N="23" REF="001800_0026_0FB82CCFA3EFB8E8"/>for the Meeting, he prepared two light Canoo's for the design, and his own Man, with the two <HI>Indians</HI> for his company. He used such argu∣ments with his tender, and now almost broken hearted Wise, from the ex∣perience of former preservations, and the prospect of the great Service he might do, might it please God to succeed his design, &amp;c. that he obtained her consent to his attempt; and committing her, his Babes and himself to Heavens protection. He set out, they had from the Shore about a League to paddle; drawing near the place they saw the <HI>Indians</HI> setting on the bank, watring for their coming. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> sent one of the <HI>Indians</HI> a-shore in one of the Canoo's, to see whither it were the same <HI>Indians</HI> whom he had appoin∣ted to meet him, and no more; and if so to stay a-shore and send <HI>George</HI> to fetch him. Accordingly <HI>George</HI> came and fetch'd Mr. <HI>Church</HI> a-shore, while the other Canoo play'd off to see the event, and to carry tydings if the <HI>In∣dians</HI> should prove false.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> ask'd <HI>George</HI> Whether <HI>Awashonks</HI> and the other <HI>Indians</HI> he ap∣pointed to meet him were there? He answered they were. He then ask'd him, If there were no more than they whom he appointed to be there? To Which he would give him no direct answer. However he went a-shore, where he was no sooner landed, but <HI>Awashonks</HI> and the reft that he had ap∣pointed to meet him there, rose up and came down to meet him; and each of them successively gave him their hands, and expressed themselves glad to see him, and gave him thanks for exposing himself to visit them. They walk'd together about a Gun-shot from the water to a convenient place to sit down. Where at once a-rose up a great body of <HI>Indians,</HI> who had lain hid in the grass, (that was as high as a Mans waste) and gathered round them, till they had clos'd them in; being all arm'd with Guns, Spears, Hat∣chets, &amp;c. with their hair trim'd and faces painted, in their Warlike ap∣pearance. It was doubtless some-what surprizing to our Gentleman at first, but without any visible discovery of it, after a small silent pause on each side, He spoke to <HI>Awashonks</HI> and told her, <HI>That</HI> George <HI>had inform'd him that see had a desire to see him, and discourse about making Peace with the</HI> English. She answered, Yes. Then said Mr. <HI>Church, It is customary when People meet to treat of Peace to lay aside their Arms, and not to appear in such Hostile form as your People do:</HI> desired of her that if they might talk about Peace, which he de∣sired they might, <HI>Her men might lay aside their Arms, and appear more treatable.</HI> Upon which there began a considerable noise and murmur among them in weir own Language. Till <HI>Awashonks</HI> ask'd him, What Arms they should lay down, and where? He (perceiving the <HI>Indians</HI> look'd very surly, and much displeased) Replied, <HI>Only their Guns at some small distance, for formality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake.</HI> Upon which with one consent they laid aside their Guns, and came and sat down.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> pulled out his Callebash and asked <HI>Awashonks, Whether she had
<PB N="24" REF="001800_0027_0FB82CD131BA4D08"/>lived so long at</HI> Wetrset, <HI>as to forget to drink</HI> Occapechees; and drinking to her, he perceived that she watch'd him very diligently to see (as he thought) wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther he swallowed any of the Rhum; he offered her the Shell, but she desired him to drink again first, He then told her, <HI>There was no poison in it,</HI> and pouring some into the Palm of his hand, sup'd it up and took the Shell and drank to her again, and drank a good Swig which indeed was no more than he needed. Then they all standing up, he said to <HI>Awashonks, You wont drink for fear there should be poison in it:</HI> And then handed it to a little ill look'd fellow, who catched it readily enough, and as greedily would have swal∣lowed the Liquor when he had it at his mouth; But Mr. <HI>Church</HI> catch'd him by the throat and took it from him, asking him, <HI>Whether he intended to swallow S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell and al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?</HI> And then handed it to <HI>Awashonks,</HI> she ventured to take a good hearty dram, and pass'd it among her Attendants.</P>
<P>The Shell being emptied, he pulled out his Tobacco, and having distri∣buted it, they began to talk.</P>
<P><HI>Awashonks</HI> demanded of him, the Reason why he had not (agreeable to his promise when she saw him last) been down at <HI>Sogkonate</HI> before now; Saying that probably if he had come then according to his promise, they had never joyned with <HI>Philip</HI> against the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>He told her he was prevented by the Wars breaking out so suddenly. And yet, he was afterwards coming down, &amp; came as far as <HI>Punkateese,</HI> where a great many <HI>Indians</HI> set upon him, and fought him a whole afternoon, tho' he did not come prepared to fight, had but Nineteen Men with him, whose chief design was to gain an Opportunity to discourse some <HI>Sogkonate Indians.</HI> Up∣on this there at once arose a mighty Murmur, consused noise, &amp; talk among the fierce lock'd Creatures, and all rising up in an hubbub; and a great surly lock'd fellow took up his <HI>Tomh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,</HI> or wooden <HI>Cutlash,</HI> to kill Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> but some others prevented him.</P>
<P>The Interpreter asked Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> if he understood what it was that the great fellow (they had hold of) said? He answered him, No. Why, faid the Interpreter, He says, you killed his Brother at <HI>Punkateese,</HI> and therefore he thirsts for your blood. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> bid the Interpreter tell him that his Brother began first: That if he had kept as <HI>Sogkonate</HI> according to his de∣sire and order, he should not have hurt him.</P>
<P>Then the chief Captain commanded <HI>Silence,</HI> and told them, That they should talk no more about old things, &amp;c. and quell'd the tumult, so that they sat down again, and began upon a discourse of making Peace with the <HI>English.</HI> Mr. <HI>Church</HI> ask'd them, <HI>What Proposals they would make, and on what terms they would break their League with</HI> Philip? Desiring them to make some Proposals that he might carry to his Master's, telling them that it was not in his Power to conclude a Peace with them, but that he knew that if their Proposals were reasonable, the Government would not be unreasonable,
<PB N="25" REF="001800_0028_0FB82CD2AC4A2280"/>and that he would use his Interest in the Government for them. And to encourage them to proceed, put them in mind that the <HI>Pequo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> once made War with the <HI>English,</HI> and that after they subjected themselves to the <HI>English,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> became their Protectors, and defended them againft other Na∣tions that would otherwise have destroyed them, &amp;c. After some further discourfe, and debate, he brought them at length to consent that if the Go∣vernment of <HI>Plymouth</HI> would firmly ingage to them, <HI>That they, and all of them, and their Wives and Children, should bave their Lives spared, and none of them trans∣ported out of the Country, they would subject themselves to them, and serve them in what they were able.</HI></P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Church</HI> told them, That he was well satisfyed the Government of <HI>Plymouth</HI> would readily concur with what they proposed, and would sign their Articles: And complementing them upon it, how pleased he was with the thoughts of their return, and of the former friendship that had been between them, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The chief Captain rose up, and expressed the great value and respect he had for Mr. <HI>Church;</HI> and bowing to him said, <HI>Sir, If you'l please to accept of me and my men, and will head us, we'l fight for you, and will help you to</HI> Philips <HI>Lead before Indian Corn be ripe</HI> And when he had ended, they all express'd their consent to what he said, and told Mr. <HI>Church</HI> they loved him, and were wil∣ling to go with him and fight for him, as long as the <HI>English</HI> had one E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣my left in the Country.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Church</HI> assured them, That if they proved as good as their word they should find him their's and their Children's laft friend. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, (by the way) the friendship is maintain'd between them to this day.</P>
<P>Then he proposed unto them, that they should choose five men to go straight with him to <HI>Plymouth:</HI> They told him, No; they would not choose, but he should take which five he pleased: some complements passed about it, at length it was agreed, They should choose Three and he Two. Then he agreed, with that he would go back to the Island that Night, and would come to them the next Morning, and go thro' the Woods to <HI>Plymouth.</HI> But they afterwards objected, That this travelling thro' the Woods would not be safe for him; the Enemy might meet with them, and kill him, and then they should lose their friend, and the whole design ruined beside. And therefore proposed, That he should come in an English Vessel and they would meet him and come on board at <HI>Sogkonate-point,</HI> and Sail from thence to <HI>Sandwich:</HI> which in fine, was concluded upon.</P>
<P>So Mr. <HI>Church</HI> promising to come as soon as he could possibly obtain a Vessel, and then they parted. He returned to the Island, and was at great pains and charge to get a Vessel, but with unaccountable disappointments, sometimes by the falseness, and sometimes by the faint-heartedness of Men that he bargained with, and something by Wind and Weather, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001800_0029_0FB82CD66A951B98"/>
Until at length Mr.<HI>Anthony Low</HI> put into the Harbour with a loaden Vessel bound to the Westward, and being made acquainted with Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> case, told him, <HI>That he had so much kindness for him, and was so pleased with the business that be was ingaged in, that be would run the venture of his Vessel &amp; Cargo, to wait upon him.</HI> Accordingly, next Morning they set Sail with a Wind that soon brought them to <HI>Sogkonate-point;</HI> but coming there they met with a contrary wind, and a great swelling See.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> were there waiting upon the Rocks, but had nothing but a miserable broken Canoo to get aboard in. Yet <HI>Peter Awashonks</HI> ventured off in it, and with a great deal of difficulty and danger got aboard. And by this time it began to Rain and Blow exceedingly, and forced them away up the Sound; and then went away thro' <HI>Bristol</HI> Ferry, round the Island to <HI>New-port,</HI> carrying <HI>Peter</HI> with them.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Church</HI> dismiss'd Mr. <HI>Low,</HI> and told him, <HI>That inasmuch as Pro∣vidence oppos'd his going by Water, and he expected that the Army would be up in a few days, and probably if be should be gone at that juncture, it might ruine the whole design; would therefore yield his Voyage.</HI></P>
<P>Then he writ the account of his transactions with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and drew up the Proposals, and Articles of Peace, and dispatch'd <HI>Peter</HI> with them to <HI>Plymouth;</HI> that his Honour the Governour if he saw cause might sign them.</P>
<P><HI>Peter</HI> was set over to <HI>Sogkonate</HI> on the Lords day Morning, with orders to take those men that were chosen to go down, or some of them at least with him. The time being expired that was appointed for the <HI>English</HI> Army to come, there was great looking for them. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> on the Monday Morning (partly to divert himself after his fategue, and partly to listen for the Army) Rid out with his Wife and some of his friends to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> un∣der a pretence of Cherrying; but came home without any News from the Army: But by Midnight, or sooner, he was roused with an Express from Maj. <HI>Bradford,</HI> who was arrived with the Army at <HI>Pocasset.</HI> To whom he forth with repaired, and informed him of the whole of his proceedings, with the <HI>Sogkonate Indians.</HI> With the Majors consent and advice, he returned a∣gain next Morning to the Island in order to go over that way to <HI>Awashonks,</HI> to inform her that the Army was arrived, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Accordingly from <HI>Sachueeset-Neck,</HI> he went in a Canoo to <HI>Sogkonate;</HI> told her Maj. <HI>Bradford</HI> was arrived at <HI>Pocasset,</HI> with a great Army, whom he had inform'd of all his proceedings with her. That if she would be advised and observe order she nor her Peo∣ple need not to fear being hurt by them. Told her, She should call all her. People down into the Neck, least if they should be found straggling about, mischief might light on them. That on the Morrow they would come down and receive her, and give her further orders. She promised to get as many of her People together as possibly she could. Desiring Mr. <HI>Church</HI> to consider that it would be dissicult for to get them together at such short
<PB N="27" REF="001800_0030_0FB82CD8A30ABFB8"/>warning. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> returned to the Island, and to the Army the same Night: The next Morning the whole Army Marched towards <HI>Sogkonate</HI> as sar as <HI>Punkateese;</HI> and Mr <HI>Church</HI> with a few Men went down to <HI>Sogkonate</HI> to call <HI>Awashonks,</HI> and her People to come up to the English Camp; as he was going down, they met with a <HI>Pocasset Indian,</HI> who had killed a Cow and got a Quarter of her on his back, and her Tongue in his Pocket; who gave them an account, That he came from <HI>Pocasset</HI> two days since in company with his Mother and several other <HI>Indians</HI> now hid in a Swamp above <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣quid;</HI> disarming of him, he sent him by two Men to Maj. <HI>Bradford,</HI> and pro∣ceeded to <HI>Sogkonate:</HI> they saw several <HI>Indians</HI> by the way skulking about, but let them pass. Arriving at <HI>Awashonks</HI> Camp, told her, <HI>He was come to invite her and her People up to</HI> Punkateese, <HI>where Maj.</HI> Bradford <HI>now was with the</HI> Ply∣mouth <HI>Army, expecting her and her Subjects to receive orders, until further order could be had from the Government.</HI> She complyed, and soon sent out orders for such of her Subjects as were not with her, immediately to come in; and by Twelve a Clock of the next day, she with most of her Number ap∣pear'd before the English Camp at <HI>Punkateese.</HI> Mr. <HI>Church</HI> tender'd the Ma∣jor to Serve under his Commission provided the <HI>Indians</HI> might be accepted with him, to fight the Enemy. The Major told him, <HI>his Orders were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>prove him, if he pleased, but as for the</HI> Indians, <HI>be would not be concerned with them.</HI> And presently gave forth orders for <HI>Awashonks,</HI> and all her Subjects both Men, Women and Children to repair to <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and to be there up∣on Peril, in Six days. <HI>Awashonks</HI> and her chiefs gather'd round Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> (where he was walk'd off from the rest) expressed themselves concerned that they could not be confided in, nor improv'd. He told them, <HI>'twas best to obey Orders; and that if he could not accompany them to</HI> Sandwich, <HI>it should not be above a Week before he would meet them there; That he was confident the Governour would Commission him to improve them.</HI> The Major haflened to send them a∣way with <HI>Jack Havens,</HI> (an <HI>Indian</HI> who had never been in the Wars) in the Front with a flag of Truce in his hand. They being gone, Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> by the help of his Man <HI>Toby</HI> (the <HI>Indian</HI> whom he had taken Prisoner, as he was going down to <HI>Sogkonote</HI>) took said <HI>Toby's</HI> Mother, &amp; those that were with her, Prisoners. Next Morning the whole Army moved back to <HI>Pocasset.</HI> This <HI>Toby</HI> informed them that there were a great many <HI>Indians</HI> gone down to <HI>Wepoiset</HI> to eat Clams, (other Provisions being very scarce with them;) that <HI>Philip</HI> himself was expected within, 3 or 4 dayes at the same Place: be∣ing asked, <HI>what Indians they were?</HI> He answered, Some <HI>Weetemo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es Indians,</HI> some <HI>Mount-hope Indians,</HI> some <HI>Narraganset Indians,</HI> and some other Upland <HI>Indians,</HI> in all about 300. The <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Boats by the Majors order meet∣ing them at <HI>Pocasset,</HI> they were soon imbark'd, it being just in the dusk of the Evening, they could plainly discover the Enemies fires at the Place the <HI>Indian</HI> directed to; and the Army concluded no other but they were bound
<PB N="28" REF="001800_0031_0FB82CDFA8634778"/>directly thither, until they came to the North End of the Island, and heard the word of Command for the Boats to bare away. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> was very fond of having this probable opportunity of surprizing that whole Company of <HI>Indians</HI> imbraced: But Orders, 'twas said, must be obeyed, which was to go to <HI>Mount-hope</HI> and there to fight <HI>Philip.</HI> This with some other good oppor∣tunities of doing spoil upon the Enemy, being unhappily miss'd. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> obtain'd the Majors Consent to meet the <HI>Sogkonate Indians,</HI> according to his promise. He was offer'd a Guard to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> but chose to go with one Man only, who was a good Pilot. About Sun set he with <HI>Sabin</HI> his Pilot mounted their Horses at <HI>Reboboth,</HI> where the Army now was, and by two Hours by Sun next Morning arrived safe at <HI>Plymouth:</HI> And by that time they had refreshed themselves the Governour and Treasurer came to Town. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> giving them a short account of the affairs of the Army <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His Honour was pleased to give him thanks for the good and great Service he had done at <HI>Sogkonate,</HI> told him, <HI>He had confirmed all that be promised</HI> Awashonks, <HI>and had sent the</HI> Indian <HI>back again that brought his Letter.</HI> He asked his Ho∣nour, <HI>Whether he had any thing later from</HI> Awashonks? He told him he had not. Where upon he gave his Honour account of the Majors orders relating to her and hers, and what discourse had passed <HI>pro &amp; con</HI> about them; and that he had promised to meet them, and that he had incouraged them, that he thought he might obtain of his Honour a Commission to lead them forth to fight <HI>Philip.</HI> His Honour smilingly told him, <HI>That be should not want Com∣mission if be would accept it, nor yet good English men enough to make up a good Army.</HI> But in short, he told his Honour the time was expired that he had appoin∣ted to meet the <HI>Sogkonates</HI> at <HI>Sandwich.</HI> The Governour asked him, when he would go? He told him that afternoon, by his Honours leave. The Go∣vernour ask'd him, How many Men he would have with him? He answe∣red. Not above half a dozen, with an order to take more at <HI>Sandwich,</HI> if he saw cause; and Horses provided. He no sooner moved it, but had his number of Men tendering to go with him, among which was Mr. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z Howland,</HI> and <HI>Nathanael Southworth;</HI> they went to <HI>Sandwich</HI> that Night; where Mr. <HI>Church</HI> (with need enough) took a Nap of Sleep. The next Morning with about 16 or 18 Men proceeded as far as <HI>Agawom,</HI> where they had great expectation of meeting the <HI>Indians,</HI> but met them not; his Men being dis∣couraged about half of them returned; only half a dozen stuck by him, &amp; or mised so to do until they should meet with the <HI>Indians.</HI> When they came to <HI>Sippio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m River,</HI> Mr. <HI>Howland</HI> began to tyre, upon which Mr <HI>Church</HI> left him, and two more, for a Reserve at the River, that if he should meet with Enemies and be forced ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, they might be ready to assist them in getting oves the River. Proceeding in their March, they crossed another River, and opened a great Bay, where they might see many Miles along shore, where were Sands and Flats; and heating a great noise below them towards
<PB N="29" REF="001800_0032_0FB82CE25F06A468"/>the Sea. They dismounted their Horses, left them and crep'd among the bushes, until they came near the bank, and saw a vast company of <HI>Indians,</HI> of all Ages and Sexs, some on Horse-back running races, some at Foot-ball, some catching Eels &amp; Flat-fish in the water, some Clamming, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but which way with safety to find out what <HI>Indians</HI> they were, they were at a loss. But at length, retiring into a thicket. Mr. <HI>Church</HI> hollow'd to them; they soon answered him, and a couple of smart young Fellows, well mounted, came upon a full Career to see who it might be that call'd, and came just upon Mr <HI>Church</HI> before they discovered him; but when they perceived themselves so near <HI>English</HI> Men, and Arm'd, were much surprized, and tack'd short a∣bout to run as fast back as they came forward, until one of the Men in the bushes call'd to them, and told them his Name was <HI>Church,</HI> and need not fear his hurting of them. Upon which, after a small pause, they turned about their Horses, and came up to him; one of them that could speak <HI>English,</HI> Mr. <HI>Church</HI> took aside and examin'd, who inform'd him, That the <HI>Indians</HI> be∣low were <HI>Awashonks,</HI> and her company, and that <HI>Jack Havens</HI> was among them; whom Mr. <HI>Church</HI> immediately sent for to come to him, and order'd the Messenger to inform <HI>Awashonks</HI> that he was come to meet her; <HI>Jack Ha∣vens</HI> soon came, and by that time Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had ask'd him a few Questions, and had been satisfyed by him, That it was <HI>Awashonks,</HI> and her company that were below, and that <HI>Jack</HI> had been kindly treated by them; a com∣pany of <HI>Indians</HI> all Mounted on Horse back, and well Arm'd came riding up to Mr. <HI>Church,</HI> but treated him with all dew respects. He then order'd <HI>Jack</HI> to go tell <HI>Awashonks,</HI> that he designed to Sup with her in the Evening, and to lodge in her Camp that Night. Then taking some of the <HI>Indians</HI> with him, he went back to the River to take care of Mr. <HI>Howland:</HI> Mr. <HI>Church</HI> being a Mind to try what Mettal he was made of, imparted his notion to the <HI>Indians</HI> that were with him, &amp; gave them directions how to act their parts; when he came pretty near the Place, he and his <HI>English</HI> Men pretendedly fled, firing on their retreat towards the <HI>Indians</HI> that pursued them, and they firing as fast after them. Mr. <HI>Howland</HI> being upon his guard, hearing the Guns, and by &amp; by seeing the motion both of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> con∣cluded his friends were distressed, was soon on the full Career on Horse-back to meet them, until he perceiving their laughing mistrusted the Truth. As soon as Mr. <HI>Church</HI> had given him the News, they hasted away to <HI>Awa∣shonks.</HI> Upon their arrival, they were immediately conducted to a shelter, open on one side, whither <HI>Awashonks</HI> and her chiefs soon came &amp; paid their Respects: and the Multitudes gave shouts as made the heavens to ring. It being now about Sun-setting, or near the dusk of the Evening; The Netops came running from all quarters loaden with the tops of dry Pines, &amp; the like combustible matter making a hugh pile thereof, near Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> shelter, on the open side thereof: but by this time Supper was brought in,
<PB N="30" REF="001800_0033_0FB82CE329926138"/>in three dishes, <HI>viz.</HI> a curious young Bass, in one dish, Eels &amp; Flat-fish in a second, and Shell-fish in a third, but neither Bread nor Salt to be seen at Table. But by that time Supper was over, the mighty pile of Pine Knots and Tops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was fired, and all the <HI>Indians</HI> great and small gathered in a ring round it. <HI>Awashonks</HI> with the oldest of her People Men and Women mix'd, kneeling down made the first ring next the fire, and all the lusty, stout Men standing up made the next; and then all the Rabble in a confused Crew surrounded on the out-side. Then the chief Captain step'd in be∣tween the rings and the fire, with a Spear in one hand and an Hatchet in the other danced round the fire, and began to fight with it, making mention of all the several Nations &amp; Companies of <HI>Indians</HI> in the Country that were Enemies to the <HI>English;</HI> &amp; at naming of every particular Tribe of <HI>Indians,</HI> he would draw out &amp; fight a new fire brand, &amp; at his finishing his fight with each particular fire-brand, would bow to him and thank him; and when he had named all the several Nations and Tribes, and fought them all he stuck down his Spear and Hatchet, and came out; and another stept in and acted over the same dance, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h more fury, if possible, than the first; and when about half a dozen of their chiefs had thus acted their parts, The Captain of the Guard stept up to Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and told him, <HI>They were making Souldiers for him, and what they had been doing was all one Swearing of them, and having in that man∣ner ingaged all the lusty stout men. Awashonks</HI> &amp; her chiefs came to Mr. <HI>Church;</HI> and told him, <HI>That now they were all ingaged to fight for the</HI> English, <HI>and he might call forth all, or any of them at any time as be saw occasion to fight the Enemy;</HI> and presented him with a very fine Firelock Mr. <HI>Church</HI> accepts their offer, drew out a number of them, and set out next Morning before day for <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> where they arrived safe the same day.</P>
<P>The Governour being informed of it, came early to Town next Morning: and by that time he had <HI>English</HI> Men enough to make up a good Company, when joyned with Mr. <HI>Churches</HI> Indians, that offered their Voluntary Service to go under his Command in quest of the Enemy.

<P>Receiving Commission he Marched the same Night into the Woods, got to <HI>Midd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry</HI> before day, and as soon as the light appeared, took into the Woods and Swampy thickets towards a place where they had some reason to expect to meet with a parcel of <HI>Narraganset Indians,</HI> with some others that belonged to <HI>Mount-hope:</HI> Coming near to where they expected them, Capt. <HI>Church</HI>'s Indian Scout discovered the Enemy, and well observing their fires, and postures, Returned with the intelligence to their Captain, who gave such directions for the surrounding of them, as had the direct effect; surpri∣zing them from every side so unexpectedly, that they were all taken, not so much as one escaped. And upon a strick examination, they gave intelli∣gence of another parcel of the Enemy, at a Place called <HI>Munponset-Pond</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> hastning with his Prisoners, thro' the Woods to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> disposed of them all, excepting only one <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry,</HI> who proving very ingenious &amp; faith∣ful to him, in informing where other parcels of the <HI>Indians</HI> hat boured Capt. <HI>Church</HI> promised him, that if he continued to be faithful to him, he should not be Sold out of the Country, but should be his waiting man, to take care of his Horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and accordingly he Served him faithfully as long as he lived. But Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was forth-with sent out again; and the Terms for his incouragement being concluded on: <HI>viz. That the Country should find them Am∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nition &amp; Provision; &amp; have half the Prisoners, &amp; Arms, they took: The Captain and his English Souldiers to have the other half of the Prisoners, and Arms; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lian Souldiers the loose Plunder.</HI> Poor incouragement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But after some time it was mended.</P>
<P>They soon Captivated the <HI>Munponsets,</HI> and brought in, not one escaping. This stroke he held several Weeks, never returning empty handed. When he wanted intelligence of their Kennelling Places, he would March to some place likely to meet with some travellers or ramblers, and scattering his Company, would lye close; and seldom lay above a day or two, at the most, before some of them would fall into their hands: Whom he would compel to inform, where their Company was; and so by his method of secret and sudden surprizes took great Numbers of them Prisoners.</P>
<P>The Government observing his extraordinary courage and conduct, and the success from Heaven added to it, saw cause to inlarge his Commission; gave him power to raise, and dismiss his Forces, as he should see occasion;
<PB N="32" REF="001800_0035_0FB82CE716E701B0"/>to Commissionate Officers under him and to March as far as he should see cause, within the limits of the three United Colonies: to receive to mercy, give quarter, or not; excepting some particular &amp; noted Murderers: <HI>viz, Philip</HI> and all that were at the destroying of Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s Garrison, and some few others</P>
<P>Major <HI>Bradford</HI> being now at <HI>Taunton</HI> with his Army, and wanting Pro∣visions; some Carts were ordered from <HI>Plymouth</HI> for their supply, and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> to guard them. But he obtaining other guards for the Carts, as far as <HI>Middleborough,</HI> ran before with a small Company, hoping to meet with some of the Enemy, appointing the Carts and their guards to meet them at <HI>Nem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sout</HI> about an hour after the Suns rising next Morning: he arrived there about the breaking of the day-light, discovered a company of the E∣nemy; but his time was too short to wait for gaining advantage; and there∣fore ran right in upon them, Surprized and Captivated about 16 of them: who upon examination, inform'd, That <HI>Tispaquin,</HI> a very famous Captain among the Enemy was at <HI>Assawompset,</HI> with a numerous Company.</P>
<P>But the Carts must now be guarded, and the opportunity of visiting <HI>Tis∣paquin</HI> must now be laid aside: The Carts are to be faithfully guarded, left <HI>Tispaquid</HI> should attack them.</P>
<P>Coming towards <HI>Taunton,</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> taking two men with him, made all speed to the Town; and coming to the River side, he hollow'd, and in∣quiring of them that came to the River, for Maj <HI>Bradford,</HI> or his Captains; he was inform'd, they were in the Town, at the Tavern. He told them of the Carts that were coming, that he had the cumber of guarding of them, which had already prevented his improving opportunities of doing Service. Pray'd therefore that a guard might be sent over to receive the Carts, that he might be at liberty; resusing all invitations and perswasions, to go over to the Tavern to visit the Major: he at length obtain'd a guard to receive the Carts; by whom also he sent his Prisoners to be convey'd with the Carts to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> directing them not to return by the way they came, but by <HI>Bridgwater.</HI></P>
<P>Hastening back he purposed to Camp that Night at <HI>Assawompset</HI> Neck. But as soon as they came to the River that runs into the great Pond thro' the thick Swamp at the entering of the Neck; the Enemy fired upon them, but hurt not a Man. Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> Indians ran right into the Swamp and fired upon them, but it being in the dusk of the Evening, the Enemy made their escape in the thickets: The Captain then moving about a Mile in∣to the Neck, tock the advantage of a small Valley to feed his Horses; some held the Horses by the Bridles, the rest on the guard look'd sharp out for the Enemy, within hearing on every side and some very near; but in the dead of the Night, the Enemy being out of hearing or still, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> moved out of the Neck (not the same way he came in, least he should be Ambus∣cado'd)
<PB N="33" REF="001800_0036_0FB82CEAB489FB50"/>toward <HI>Cushnet,</HI> where all the Houses were burnt; and crossing <HI>Cushne</HI> River being extreamly fategued, with two Nights and one Days ram∣ble without Rest or Sleep; and observing good forage for their Horses, the Captain concluded upon bai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and taking a Nap. Setting Six Men to watch the passage of the River, two to watch at a time, while the other slept, &amp; so to take their turns; while the rest of the Company went into a thicket to Sleep under the guard of two Sentinels more. But the whole Company being very drowsy, soon forgot their danger, and were fast a-sleep, Senti∣nels, and all. The Captain first awakes, looks up, and judges he had slept four Hours, which being longer than he designed, immediately rouses his Company, and sends away a file to see what were become of the watch at the passage of the River, but they no sooner opened the River in sight, but they discovered a company of the Enemy viewing of their tracts, where they came into the Neck; Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and those with him soon dispers'd into the brush on each side of the way, while the file sent, got undiscovered to the passage of the River, and found their watch all fast a sleep: but these Tidings thoroughly awakened the whole Company. But the Enemy giving them no present disturbance, they examined their Snapsacks, and taking a little refreshment, the Captain orders one party to guard the Horses, and the other to Scout, who soon met with a Track, and following of it, they were bro't to a small company of <HI>Indians,</HI> who proved to be <HI>Little Eyes,</HI> and his Family, and near Relations, who were of <HI>Sogkonate,</HI> but had forsa∣ken their Country men, upon their making Peace with the <HI>English.</HI> Some of Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> Indians asked him, <HI>If he did not know that fellow?</HI> Told him, <HI>This is the Rogue that would have killed you at</HI> Awashonks <HI>Dance;</HI> and signified to him that now he had an opportunity to be revenged on him. But the Captain told them, <HI>It was not English-mans fashion to seek reverge; and that he should have the same quarter the rest had.</HI> Moving to the River side, they found an old Canoo, with which the Captain ordered <HI>Little Eyes</HI> and his company to be carryed over to an Island. Telling him, <HI>he would leave him on that Island until be returned; and lest the English should light on them, and kill them, be would leave his cousin</HI> Light-foot (<HI>whom the English knew to be their Friend</HI>) <HI>to be his guard. Little Eyes</HI> expressed himself very thankful to the Captain. He leaving his orders with <HI>Light-foot,</HI> returns to the Rivers side towards <HI>Poneganset,</HI> to <HI>Russ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l▪</HI> Orchard, coming near the Orchard they clap'd into a thicket and there lodg'd the rest of the Night without any fire; and upon the Morning light appearing, moves towards the Orchard, discovers some of the Enemy, who had been there the day before, and had beat down all the Apples, and carryed them away; discovered also where they had lodg'd that Night, and saw the ground where they set their baskets bloody, being as they supposed and as it was afterwards discovered to be with the flesh of Swine, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> which they had killed that day: They had lain under
<PB N="34" REF="001800_0037_0FB82CECED442668"/>the Fences without any fires; and seem'd by the marks they lest behind them to be very numerous, perceived also by the dew on the grass that they had not been long gone; and therefore mov'd a-pace in pursuit of them Travelling three Miles, or more, they came into the Country Road, where the track parted one parcel steered towards the West end of the great Ce∣dar Swamp, and the other to the East end. The Captain halted and told his <HI>Indian Souldiers, That they had heard as well as he, what some Men bad said at</HI> Plymouth <HI>about them, &amp;c. That now was a good opportunity for each party to prove themselves: The Track being divided they should follow one, and the English the o∣ther, being equal in number.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> declined the Motion, and were not willing to move any where without him; said <HI>they should not think themselves safe without him.</HI> But the Captain insisting upon it, they submitted; he gave the <HI>Indians</HI> their choice to follow which track they pleased; they replyed, <HI>They were light and able to Travel, therefore of be pleased ther would take the West Track.</HI> And appointing the Ruins of <HI>John Cooks</HI> House at <HI>Cushnet</HI> for the place to meet at; each Company set out briskly to try their Fortunes. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with his <HI>English</HI> Soldiers followed their Track until they came near entring a miery Swamp, when the Capt. heard a Whistle in the Rear, (which was a note for a halt) looking behind him, he saw <HI>William Fobes</HI> start out of the Company and made towards him, who hasten'd to meet him as fast as he could; <HI>Fobes</HI> told him they had discovered abundance of <HI>Indians,</HI> and if he pleased to go a few steps back he might see them himself: he did so, and saw them a-cross the Swamp, observing them, he perceived they were gathering of <HI>Hurtle-Berries,</HI> and that they had no apprehensions of their being so near them; The Captain supposed them to be chiefly Women, and therefore calling one Mr. <HI>Dillano,</HI> who was acquainted with the ground, and the Indian Language, and another named Mr. <HI>Barns;</HI> with these two Men he takes right thro' the Swamp as fast as he could, and orders the reft to hasten after them. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with <HI>Dillano</HI> &amp; <HI>Barns</HI> ha∣ving good Horses, spur'd on and where soon among the Thickest of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and out of sight of their own Men: Among the Enemy was an <HI>Indian</HI> Woman (who with her Husband had been drove off from <HI>Rhode-Island</HI>) notwithstanding they had an House upon Mr. <HI>Sanford's</HI> Land, and had planted an Orchard before the War; yet the Inhabitants would not be satisfyed till they were sent off; and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with his Family, living then at the said <HI>Sanfords,</HI> came acquainted with them, who thought it very hard to turn off such old, quiet People: but in the end it prov'd a Providence &amp; an advan∣tage to him and his Family, as you may see afterwards. This <HI>Indian</HI> Wo∣man knew Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> and as soon as she saw him held up both her hands and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nning towards him, crying aloud, <HI>Church, Church, Church.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> bid her stop the rest of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and tell them, <HI>The way to save their Lives was not to run, but yield themselves Prisoners, and be would not kill them;</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="001800_0038_0FB82CEE6AD85A70"/>so with her help, and <HI>Dillano's,</HI> who could call to them in their own Lan∣guage, many of them stop'd and surrendred themselves; others scampering and casting away their baskets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> betook themselves to the thickets, but Capt. <HI>Church</HI> being on Horse-back soon came up with them, and laid hole on a Gun that was in the hand of one of the foremost of the company, pull'd it from him, and told him he must go back. And when he had turn∣ed them, he began to look about him to see where he was, and what was become of his Company, hoping they might be all as well imploy'd as him∣self, but could find none but <HI>Dillano,</HI> who was very busy gathering up Priso∣ners; the Captain drove his that he had stop'd to the rest, inquiring of <HI>Dillano</HI> for their Company, but could have no news of them. But moving back picked up now and then a skulking Prisoner by the way. When they came near the place where they first started the <HI>Indians,</HI> they discover'd their Company standing in a body together, and had taken some few Prisoners; when they saw their Captain, they hastened to meet him: They told him they found it difficult getting thro' the Swamp, and neither seeing nor hear∣ing any thing of him, they concluded the Enemy had kill'd him, and were at a great loss what to do. Having brought their Prisoners together they found they had taken and kill'd 66 of the Enemy. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> then ask'd the old Squaw, <HI>What company they belonged unto?</HI> She said, They belonged part to <HI>Philip,</HI> and part to <HI>Qunnappin</HI> and the <HI>Narraganset-Sachem,</HI> discovered also upon her declaration that both <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Qunnappin</HI> were about two Miles off in the great Cedar Swamp; he enquired of her, <HI>What company they had with them?</HI> She answered, <HI>Abundance of Indians: The Swamp,</HI> she said, <HI>was full of Indians from one end unto the other, that were settled there, that there were near an 100 men came from the Swamp with them, and left them upon that plain to ga∣ther Hurtle-berry's, and promised to call them as they came back out of</HI> Sconticut-Neck, <HI>whither they went to kill Cattel and Horses for Provisions for the company.</HI> She perceiving Capt. <HI>Church</HI> move towards the Neck, told him, <HI>If they went that way they would all be kill'd.</HI> He ask'd her, <HI>Where-about they cross'd the Ri∣ver?</HI> She pointed to the upper passing place. Upon which Capt. <HI>Church</HI> passed over so low down as he thought it not probable they should meet with his Track in their return; and hastened towards the Island, where he left <HI>Little Eyes,</HI> with <HI>Light-foot.</HI> Finding a convenient place by the River side for the Securing their Prisoners, Capt <HI>Church,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dillano</HI> went down to see what was become of Capt. <HI>Light-foot,</HI> and the Prisoners left in his charge. <HI>Light-foot</HI> seeing and knowing them, soon came over with his broken Canoo; and inform'd them, <HI>That he had seen that day about 100 Men of the Enemy go down into</HI> Sconticut Neck, <HI>and that they were now returning again:</HI> Upon which they three ran down immediately to a Meadow where <HI>Light-foot</HI> said the <HI>Indians</HI> had passed; where they not only saw their Tracks, but also them: Where-upon they lay close until the Enemy came into the said
<PB N="36" REF="001800_0039_0FB82CEFF348D478"/>Meadow, and the fore-most sat down his load and halted until als the com∣pany came up, and then took up their loads &amp; march'd again the same way that they came down into the Neck, which was the nearest way unto their Camp; had they gone the other way along the River, they could not have missed Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> Track, which, would doubtless have expos'd them to the loss of their Prisoners, if not of their lives. But as soon as the Coast was clear of them, the Captain sends his <HI>Light-foot</HI> to fetch his Prisoners from the Island, while he and Mr. <HI>Dillano</HI> returns to the company, sent part of them to conduct <HI>Light-foot</HI> &amp; his company to the aforesaid Meadow, where Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his company met them; crossing the Enemies Track they made all hast, until they got over <HI>Mattapoiset-river,</HI> near about sour Miles beyond the ruines of <HI>Cooks</HI> House, where he appointed to meet his <HI>Indian</HI> company, whither he sent <HI>Dillano,</HI> with two more to meet them; ordering them, that if the <HI>Indians</HI> were not arrived, to wait for them. Accordingly, finding no <HI>Indians</HI> there, they waited until late in the Night, when they arrived with their booty. They dispatch'd a Post to their Captain to give him an ac∣count of their Success; but the day broke before they came to him: And when they had compared Successes, they very remarkably found that the number that each Company had taken and slain, was equal. The <HI>Indians</HI> had kill'd 3 of the Enemy, and taken 63 Prisoners, as the <HI>English</HI> had done before them, both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> were surpriz'd at this remarkable Pro∣vidence, and were both parties rejoycing at it; being both-before afraid of what might have been the event of the unequal Success of the parties. But the <HI>Indians</HI> had the fortune to take more Arms than the <HI>English.</HI> They told the Captain, <HI>That they had missed a brave Opportunity by parting; They came upon a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at Town of the Enemy,</HI> viz <HI>Capt.</HI> Tyasks <HI>company, (Tyasks</HI> was the next man to <HI>Philip) They fired upon the Enemy before they were discovered, and ran upon them with a shout; the Men ran and left their Wives and Children, and many of them their Guns: They took</HI> Tyasks <HI>Wife and Son, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'t that if their Captain &amp; the English company had been with them they might have taken some hundreds of them: And now they determined not to part any more.</HI></P>
<P>That Night <HI>Philip</HI> sent (as afterwards they found out) a great Army to way-lay Capt. <HI>Church</HI> at the entring on of <HI>Assawompset</HI> Neck, expecting he would have returned the same way he went in; but that was never his me∣thod to return the same way that he came; &amp; at this time going another way he escaped falling into the hands of his Enemies. The next day they went home by <HI>Sapican,</HI> and got well with their Prisoners to <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P>He soon went out again; and this stroke he drove many Weeks; and when he took any number of Prisoners, he would pick out some that he took a fancy to, and would tell them, <HI>He took a particular fancy to them, and had chose them for himself to make Souldiers of; and if any would behave themselves well, be would do well by them, and they should be his men and not Sold out of the Country.</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="001800_0040_0FB82CF36706FB68"/>If he perceived they look'd surly, and his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers call'd them trea∣cherous Dogs, as some of them would sometimes do, all the notice he would take of it, would only be to clap them on the back, and tell them, <HI>Come, come, yu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k wild and surly, and mutter, but that signifies nothing, these my best Souldiers were a little while a go as wild and surly as you are now; by that time you have been but one day along with me, you'l love me too, and be as brisk as any of them.</HI> And it prov'd so. For there was none of them but (after they had been a little while with him, and see his behaviour, and how chearful and successful his Men were) would be as ready to Pilot him to any place where the <HI>Indians</HI> dwelt or haunted (tho' their own Fathers or nearest Relations should be among them) or to fight for him, as any of his own Men.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was in two particulars much advantaged by the great <HI>Eng∣ish</HI> Army that was now abroad. One was, that they drove the Enemy down to that part of the Country, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Eastward of <HI>Taunton</HI> River by which means his business was nearer home. The other was that when ever he fell on with a push upon any body of the Enemy (were they never so many) they fled expecting the great Army. And his manner of Marching thro' the Woods was such, as if he were discovered, they appeared to be more than they were. For the always Marched at a wide distance one from another, partly for their safety: and this was an <HI>Indian</HI> custom, to March thin and scatter. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> inquired of some of the <HI>Indians</HI> that were become his Souldiers, <HI>How they got such advantage often of the English in their Marches thro' the Woods?</HI> They told him, That the <HI>Indians</HI> gain'd great advantage of the <HI>English</HI> by two things; The <HI>Indians</HI> always took care in their Marches and Fights, not to come too thick together. But the <HI>English</HI> always kept in a heap together, that it was as easy to hit them as to hit an House. The o∣ther was, that if at any time they discovered a company of <HI>English</HI> Souldi∣ers in the Woods, they knew that there was all, for the <HI>English</HI> never scat∣tered; but the <HI>Indians</HI> always divided and scattered.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> now at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> something or other happen'd that kept him at home a few days, until a Post came to <HI>Marshfield</HI> on the Lords day Morn∣ing, informing the Governour that a great Army of <HI>Indians</HI> were discove∣red, who it was supposed were designing to get over the River towards <HI>Taunton</HI> or <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> to Attack those Towns that lay on that side the Ri∣ver. The Governour hastned to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> raised what Men he could by the way, came to <HI>Plymouth</HI> in the beginning of the forenoon Exercise; sent for Capt. <HI>Church</HI> out of the Meeting-house, gave him the News, and desired him immediately to Rally what of his Company he could; and what Men he had raised should joyn them. The Captain bestirs himself, but found no Bread in the Store-house, and so was fore'd to run from House to House to get House-hold Bread for their March; but this nor any thing else pre∣vented his Marching by the beginning of the afternoon Exercise; March∣ing
<PB N="38" REF="001800_0041_0FB82CF618586048"/>with what Men were ready he took with him the Post that came from <HI>Bridgwater</HI> to Pilot him to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace, where he tho'the might meet with the Enemy. In the Evening they heard a smart thing at a distance from them, but it being near Night, and the firing bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of short continuance, the miss'd the place and went into <HI>Bridgwater</HI> Town. It seems, the occasion of the firing, was, That <HI>Philip</HI> finding that Capt. <HI>Church</HI> made that side of the Coun∣try too hot for him, design'd to return to the other side of the Country that he came last from. And coming to <HI>Taunton</HI> River with his company, they fell'd a great Tree a-cross the River for a Bridge to pass over on: and just as <HI>Philips</HI> old Uncle <HI>Akkompoin,</HI> and some other of his chiefs were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffing over the Tree, some brisk <HI>Bridgwater</HI> Lads, had Ambush'd them, fired upon them, and killed the old man, and several others, which put a stop to their coming over the River that Night.</P>
<P>Next Morning Capt. <HI>Church</HI> moved very early with his Company which was increased by many of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> that listed under him for that Expedi∣tion, and by their Piloting, he soon came very still, to the top of the great Tree which the Enemy had fallen a-cross the River; and the Captain spy'd an <HI>Indian</HI> sitting upon the stump of it on the other side of the River; and he clap'd his Gun up, and had doubtless dispatch'd him, but that one of his own <HI>Indians</HI> called hastily to him, Not to fire for he believed it was one of his own men; upon which the <HI>Indian</HI> upon the stump lock'd about, and Capt. <HI>Churbes Indian</HI> seeing his face perceived his mistake, for he knew him to be <HI>Philip;</HI> clap'd up his Gun and fired, but it was too late, for <HI>Philip</HI> im∣mediately threw himself off the slump, leap'd down a bank on the side of the River, and made his escape. Capt <HI>Church</HI> as soon as possible got over the River, and scattered in quest of <HI>Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p,</HI> and his company; but the Enemy scattered and sled every way; but he pick'd up a considerable many of their Women and Children, among which was <HI>Philip's</HI> Wife, and Son of about Nine Years Old. Discovering a considerable new Track along the River, and examining the Prisoners, found that it was <HI>Qunn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppin</HI> and the <HI>Narragan∣sets,</HI> that were drawing off from those parts towarcs the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Country, he inquired of the Prisoners, <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther</HI> Philip <HI>were gone in the same Track?</HI> they told him, <HI>They did not know, for he sled in a great fright when the first</HI> English <HI>Gun was fired, and they had none of them seen or heard any thing of him since.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> lest part of his Company there to secure the Prisoners they got, and to pick up what more they could find; and with the rest of his com∣pany hasted in the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack of the Enemy to over-take them, if it might be, before they got over the River, and ran some Miles along the River until he came unto a place where the <HI>Indians</HI> had waded over; and he with his Company waded over after them up to the Arm pits; being almost as wet before with Sweat as the River could make them: Following about a Mile further, and not overtaking them, and the Captain being under a necessity

The Captain fol∣lowed them by the Track, putting his <HI>Indians</HI> in the Front; some of which were such as he had newly taken from the Enemy, and added to his Com∣pany. Gave them order to March softly, and upon hearing a whistle in the Rear to sit down, till further order. Or upon discovery of any of the Ene∣my to stop, for his design was, if he could, discover where the Enemy were, not to fall upon them (unless necessicated to do it) until next Morning. The <HI>Indians</HI> in the Front came up with many Women and Children, and o∣thers that were faint and tired, and so not able to keep up with the Com∣pany; these gave them an account that <HI>Philip</HI> with a great number of the Enemy were a little before. Capt, <HI>Churches Indians</HI> told the others. <HI>They were their Prisoners, but if they would submit to order and be still no one should burt them</HI> They being their old acquaintance, they were easily perswaded to conform. A little before Sun set there was a halt in the Front until the Captain came up, and they told him, <HI>They discovered the Enemy:</HI> He order'd them, to dog them and watch their motion till it was dark. But <HI>Philip</HI> soon came to a stop, and fell to breaking and chopping Wood, to make fires: and a great mise they made. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> draws his company up into a ring, and sat down in the Swamp without any noise or fire: The <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners were much surprized to see the <HI>English</HI> Souldiers; but the Captain told them, <HI>If they would be quiet and not make any disturbance or noise, they should meet with civil treatment, but if they made any disturbance, or offered to run, or make their escape, be would immediately kill them all;</HI> so they were very submissive &amp; obsequious. When the day broke Capt. <HI>Church</HI> told his Prisoners, <HI>That his Expedition was such at this time that be could not afford them any guard:</HI> Told them, <HI>They would find it to be their interest to attend the orders he was now about to give them; which was, That when the fight was over, which they now expected; or as soon as the firing ceased, they must follow the Tracks of bis Company and come to them.</HI> (An

He said to them, <HI>It would be in vain for them to think of disobedience, or to gain any thing by it, for he had taken and killed a great many of the</HI> Indian <HI>Rebels, and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld in a little time kill and take all the rest,</HI> &amp;c. By this time it began to be so light, as the time that he usually chose to make his on set. He moved sending two Souldi∣ers before to try if they could privately discover the Enemies postures. But very unhappily it sell out, that the very same time <HI>Philip</HI> had sent two of his as a Scout upon his own Track, to see if none dog'd them; who spy'd the two <HI>Indian</HI> men, and turn'd short about, and sled with all speed to their Camp: and Capt <HI>Church</HI> pursued as fast as he could; the two <HI>Indians</HI> set a yelling and howling, and made the most hideous noise they could invent, soon gave the Alarm to <HI>Philip</HI> &amp; his Camp; who all sled at the first tydings, left their Kittles boiling &amp; Meat roasting upon their wooden Spits, &amp; run into a Swamp with no other Break-fast, than what Capt. <HI>Church</HI> afterwards treated them with. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> pursuing, sent Mr. <HI>Isaac Howland</HI> with a party on one side of the Swamp, while himself with the rest ran on the other-side, agreeing to run on each side, until they met on the further end▪ placing some men in secure Stands at that end of the Swamp where <HI>Philip</HI> entered, concluding that if they headed him and beat him back, that he would take back in his own Track. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and Mr. <HI>Howland</HI> soon met at the fur∣ther end of the Swamp (it not being a great one) where they met with a great number of the Enemy, well armed, coming out of the Swamp. But on sight of the <HI>English</HI> they seemed very much surprized &amp; tack'd short. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> called hastily to them, and said, <HI>If they fired one Gun they were all dead men; for he would have them know: bat he bad them hem'd in, with a force suffici∣ent to command them; but if they peaceably surrender'd they should have good quar∣ter,</HI> &amp;c. They seeing both <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> come so thick upon them, were so surprized that many of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ood still and let the <HI>English</HI> come and take the Guns out of their hands, when they were both charged and cock'd. Many both Men, Women and Children of the Enemy were imprisoned at this time; while <HI>Philip, Tispaquin, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>toson,</HI> &amp;c. concluded that the <HI>English</HI> would pursue them upon their Tracks, so were way-laying their Tracks at the first end of the Swamp, hoping thereby to gain a shot upon Capt. <HI>Church</HI> who was now better imploy'd in taking his Prisoners &amp; running them in∣to a Valley, in form something shap'd like a Punch-bole, and appointing a guard-of two files trible armed with Guns taken from the Enemy. But <HI>Philip</HI> having waited all this while in vain, now moves on after the rest of his com∣pany to see what was become of them. And by this time Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was got into the Swamp ready to meet him; and as it happen'd made the first discovery, clapt behind a Tree until <HI>Philips</HI> company came pretty near, and then tired upon them, kill'd many of them, and a close skirmish followed. Upon this <HI>Philip</HI> having grounds sufficient to suspect the event of his com∣pany
<PB N="41" REF="001800_0044_0FB82CFEC34BA890"/>that went before them, fled back upon his own Track; and coming to the place where the Ambush lay, they fired on each other, and one <HI>Lucus</HI> of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> not being so careful as he might have been about his Stand, was kill'd by the <HI>Indians.</HI> In this Swamp skirmish Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with his two men which always ran by his side as his guard, met with three of the Enemy, two of which surrendred themselves, and the Captains guard seized them, but the other being a great stout surly fellow, with his two locks ty'd up with red and a great Rattle-snake skin hanging to the back part of his head, (whom Capt. <HI>Church</HI> concluded to be <HI>Totoson</HI>) ran from them into the Sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp Capt <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urch</HI> in person pursued him close, till coming pretty near up with him, presented his Gun between his Shoulders, but it missing fire, the <HI>Indian</HI> perceiving it, turn'd and presented at Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> and missing fire also; their Guns taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et with the Fog and Dew of the Morning; but the <HI>Indian</HI> turning short for another run, his foot trip'd in a small grape∣vine, and he sell fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t on his face; Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was by this time up with him, and struck the Muzzle of his Gun an inch and half into the back part of his head, which dispatch'd him without another blow. But Capt. <HI>Church</HI> look∣ing behind him saw <HI>Totoson</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> whom he tho't he had kill'd, come flying at him like a dragon: But this happened to be fair in sight of the guard that were set to keep the Prisoners, who spying <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>toson</HI> and others that were following of him, in the very seasonable juncture made a shot upon them, and rescued their Captain; tho' he was in no small danger from his friends bullets, for some of them came so near him that he tho't he felt the wind of them. The skirmish being over, they gathered their Prisoners to∣gether, and found the number that they had killed and taken was 173 (the Prisoners which they took over Night included) who after the skirmish came to them, as they were ordered.</P>
<P>Now having no Provisions, but what they took from the Enemy, they hastened to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> sending an express before to provide for them, their Company being now very numerous. The Gentlemen of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> met Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with great expression of honour and thanks, and received him and his Army with all due respect and kind treatment.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> drove his Prisoners that Night into <HI>Bridgwater</HI> Pound, and set his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers to guard them. They being well treated with Victu∣als and drink, they had a merry Night; and the Prisoners laugh'd as loud as the Souldiers, not being so treated a long time before.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> now said to Capt. <HI>Church, Sir, You have now mads</HI> Phi∣lip <HI>ready to dye, for you have made him as poor, and miserable as be us'd to make the</HI> English; <HI>for you have now k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled or taken all his Relations. That they believed he would now soon have his head, and that this bout had almost broke his heart.</HI></P>
<P>The next day Capt <HI>Church</HI> moved and arrived with all his Prisoners safe at <HI>Plymouth.</HI> The great <HI>English</HI> Army were now at <HI>Taunton,</HI> and Maj. <HI>Talcot</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="001800_0045_0FB82CFFA24502A0"/>with the <HI>Connecticut</HI> Forces being in those parts of the Country, did consi∣derable spoil upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>Now Capt. <HI>Church</HI> being arrived at <HI>Plym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth,</HI> received thanks from the Government for his good Service, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> many of his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uldiers were dis∣banded; and he tho't to reft himself a while being much fategued and his health impared, by excessive hearts and colds, and wading thro' Rivers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But it was not long before he was call'd upon to Rally, upon advice that some of the Enemy were discovered in <HI>Dartmouth</HI> woods. He took his <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and as many <HI>English</HI> Volunteers as presented, to go with him, and scat∣tering into small parcels. Mr. <HI>Jahez Howland</HI> (who was now, and often his Lieutenant and a worthy good Souldiers) had the fortune to discover and imprison a parcel of the Enemy. In the Evening they met together at an appointed place, and by examining the Prisoners, they gain'd intelli∣gence of <HI>Totosons</HI> haunt; and being brisk in the Morning, they soon gain'd an advantage of <HI>Totosons</HI> company, tho' he himself with his Son of about Eight Years old made their escape, and one old Squaw with them, to <HI>Aga∣wom</HI> his own Country. But <HI>Sam Barrow,</HI> as noted a Rogue as any among the Enemy, fell into the hands of the <HI>English,</HI> at this time. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> told him, <HI>That because of his inhumane Murders and Barbarities, the Court had allow'd him no quarter, but was to be forthwith put to Death, and therefore he was to pre∣pare for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Barrow</HI> reply'd, <HI>That the Sentence of Death against him was just, and that indeed he was ashamed to live any longer, and desired no more favour than to Sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke a Whiff of Tobacco before his Execution.</HI> When he had taken a few Whiffs, he said, <HI>He was ready;</HI> upon which one of Capt. <HI>Churches Indians</HI> sunk his Hatchet into his Brains.

The old Squaw slung a few leaves and brush over him, and came into <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and gave this account of his death, and offe∣red to shew them where she lest his body; but never had the opportunity, for she immediately fell sick and dy'd also.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> being now at <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mouth</HI> again weary and worn, would have gone home to his Wife and Family, but the Government being Solicitous to ingage him in the Service until <HI>Philip</HI> was slain, and promising him satis∣faction and redress for some mistreatment that he had met with: He fixes for another Expedition; he had soon Volunteers enough to make up the Company he desired and Marched thro' the Woods, until he came to <HI>Pocas∣set.</HI> And not seeing nor hearing of any of the Enemy, they went over the Ferry to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> to refresh themselves. The Captain with about half a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his company took Horse &amp; rid about eight Miles down the <HI>Island,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. <HI>Sanf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds</HI> where he had left his Wife; who no sooner saw him but
<PB N="43" REF="001800_0046_0FB82D012375AAD0"/>fainted with the surprize; and by that time she was a little revived, they spy'd two Horse men corning a great pace. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> told his company that those men (by their riding) came with Tydings. When they came up they prov'd to be Maj <HI>Sanford</HI> and Capt. <HI>Golding;</HI> who immediately ask'd Capt. <HI>Church, What be woud give to bear some News of</HI> Philip? He reply'd, <HI>That was what he wanted.</HI> They told him <HI>They had rid bard with some hopes of over∣taking of him, and were now come on purp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to inform him, That there was just now Tydings from</HI> Mount-hope; <HI>An</HI> Indian <HI>came down from thence (where</HI> Philips <HI>Camp now was) on to</HI> Sand point <HI>over against</HI> Trips, <HI>and hollow'd, and made signs to be fetch'd over; and being fetch'd over, be reported, That be was fled from</HI> Philip, <HI>who</HI> (said he) <HI>has kill'd my Brother just before I came away, for giving some ad∣vice that displeased him.</HI> And said, <HI>he was fled for fear of meeting with the same his Brother had met with.</HI> Told them also, <HI>That</HI> Philip <HI>was now in</HI> Mount-hope <HI>Nick.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> thank'd them for their good News, and said, he hop'd by to Morrow Morning to have the Rogues head. The Horses that he and his company came on standing at the door, (for they had not been unsaddled) his Wife must content her self with a short visit, when such game was a-head; they immediately Mounted, set Spurs to their Horses, and away. The two Gentlemen that bro't him the Tydings, told him, <HI>They would gladly wait upon him to see the event of this Expedition.</HI> He thank'd them, and told them, he should be as fond of their company as any Mens; and (in short) they went with him. And they were soon as <HI>Trips</HI> Ferry (with Capt <HI>Churches</HI> company) where the deserter was; who was a fellow of good sense, and told his story handsomely: he offered Capt. <HI>Church</HI> to Pilot him to <HI>Philip,</HI> and to help to kill him, that he might revenge his Brothers death. Told him, That <HI>Philip</HI> was now upon a little spot of Upland that was in the South end of the miery Swamp just at the foot of the Mount, which was a spot of ground that Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was well acquainted with. By that time they were got over the Ferry, and came near the ground half the Night was spent, the Capt. commands a halt, and bringing the company together, he asked Maj <HI>Sanford</HI> &amp; Capt. <HI>Goldings</HI> advice, what method was best to take in making the on-set, but they declining giving any advice, telling him, <HI>That his great Experience &amp; Success forbid their taking upon them to give advice.</HI> Then Capt. <HI>Church</HI> offered Capt. <HI>Golding,</HI> that he should have the honour (if he would please to accept of it) to beat up <HI>Philips</HI> head∣quarters. He accepted the offer and had his alotted number drawn out to him, and the Pilot. Capt <HI>Churches</HI> instructions to him were to be very care∣ful in his approach to the Enemy, and be sure not to shew himself until by day light they might see and discern their own men from the Enemy. Told him also, That his custom in the like cases was to creep with his company on their bellies, until they came as near as they could; and that as soon as the Enemy discovered them they would cry out; and that was the word
<PB N="44" REF="001800_0047_0FB82D03B2243650"/>for his Men to fire and fall on. Directed him when the Enemy should start and take into the Swamp, they should pursue with speed, every man shouting and making what noise they could; for he would give orders to his Ambuscade to fire on any that should come silently. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> know∣ing it was <HI>Philips</HI> custom to be fore-most in the flight, went down to the Swamp and gave Capt. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Situate</HI> the command of the right wing of the Ambush, and placed and <HI>English-man</HI> and an <HI>Indian</HI> together behind such shelters of Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that he could find, and tock care to place them at such distance as none might pass undiscovered between them, charg'd 'em to be careful of themselves, and of hurting their friends: And to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e at a∣ny that should come silently thro' the Swamp: But it being some-what fur∣ther thro' the Swamp than he was aware of, he wanted men to make up his Ambuscad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; having placed what men he had he took Maj <HI>Sanford</HI> by the hand, said, <HI>Sir, I have so placed them that us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> Philip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>them.</HI> The same moment a Shot whistled over their heads and then the noise of a Gun towards <HI>Philips</HI> Camp. Capt <HI>Church</HI> at first tho't it might be some Gun fired by accident: but before he could speak, a whole Volley follow∣ed, which was earlier than he expected. One of <HI>Philips</HI> gang going forth to ease himself, when he had done, look'd round him, &amp; Capt. <HI>Golding</HI> thought the <HI>Indian</HI> looked right at him (tho' probably 'twas but his conceit) so fired at him, and upon his firing, the whole company that were with him fired upon the Enemies shelter before the <HI>Indians</HI> had time to rise from their sleep, and so over-shot them But their shelter was open on that side ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Swamp, built so on purpose for the convenience of flight on occasion. They were soon in the Swamp and <HI>Philip</HI> the foremost, who starting at the first Gun threw his Petunk and Powder horn over his head, catch'd up his Gun, and ran as fast as he could scamper, without any more clothes than his small breeches and stockings, and ran directly upon two of Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> Ambush; they let him come fair within shot, and the <HI>English</HI> mans Gun mis∣sing fire, he bid the <HI>Indian</HI> fire away, and he did so to purpose, sent one Mus∣ket Bullet thro' his heart, and another not above two inches from it; he fell upon his face in the Mud &amp; Water with his Gun under him. By his time the Enemy perceived they were way laid on the east side of the <HI>Swamp,</HI> tack'd short about. One of the Enemy who seem'd to be a great surly old fel∣low, hollow'd with a loud voice, &amp; often called out, <HI>iootash, iootash,</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> called to his <HI>Indian Peter</HI> and ask'd him, <HI>Who that was that called so?</HI> He answered, It was old <HI>Annowon Philips</HI> great Captain, calling on his Souldiers to stand to it and sigh stoutly. Now the Enemy finding that place of the <HI>Swamp</HI> which was not Ambush'd, many of them made their escape in the <HI>English</HI> Tracks. The Man that had shot down <HI>Philip,</HI> ran with all speed to Capt <HI>Church,</HI> and informed him of his exploit, who commanded him to be Silent about it, &amp; let no man more know it, until they had drove the <HI>Swamp</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="001800_0048_0FB82D0420A34D08"/>clean; but when they had drove the <HI>Swamp</HI> thro' &amp; found the Enemy had escaped, or at least the most of them; and the Sun now up, and so the dew gone, that they could not so easily Track them, the whole Company met together at the place where the Enemies Night shelter was; and then Capt. <HI>Church</HI> gave them the news of <HI>Philips</HI> death; upon which the whole Army gave Three loud <HI>Huzza's.</HI> Capt <HI>Church</HI> ordered his body to be pull'd out of the mire on to the Upland, so some of Capt. <HI>Churches Indians</HI> took hold of him by his Stockings, and some by his small Breeches, (being otherwise naked) and drew him thro' the Mud unto the Upland, and a doleful, great, naked, dirty beast, he look'd like. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> then said, <HI>That forasmuch as be bad caused many an</HI> English mans <HI>body to lye unburied and ret above ground, that not me of bis bones should be buried.</HI> And calling his old <HI>Indian</HI> Executioner, bid him behead and quarter him. Accordingly, he came with his Hatchet and stood ever him, but before he struck he made a small Speech directing it to <HI>Philip;</HI> and said, <HI>He bad been a very great Man, and bad made many a man afraid of him, but so big as be was be would now chop bis Aß for him;</HI> and so went to work, and did as he was ordered. <HI>Philip</HI> having one very remarkable hand being much scarr'd, occasioned by the splitting of a Pistol in it formerly. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> gave the head and that hand to <HI>Alderman,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> who shot him, to show to such Gentlemen as would bestow gratuities upon him; and accordingly he got many Peny by it. This being on the last day of the Week, the Captain with his Company returned to the Island, tarryed there until Tuesday; and then went off and ranged thro' all the Woods to <HI>Ply∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th,</HI> and received their <HI>Praemium,</HI> which was <HI>Thirty Shilling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per</HI> head, for the Enemies which they had killed or taken, instead of all Wages; and <HI>Philips</HI> head went at the same price. Methinks it's scanty reward and poor incon∣ragement; tho' it was better than what had been some time before. For this March they received <HI>Four Shillings</HI> and <HI>Six Pence</HI> a Man, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was all the Reward they had, except the honour of killing <HI>Philip.</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> in the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> 1676</P>

But early on the Lords day Morning, there came a Post to inform the Captain. That early the same Morning a Canon with several <HI>Indians</HI> in it passed from <HI>Prudence Island to Poppasquash</HI> Neck. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> tho't if he could possibly surprize them, he might probably gain force intelligence of more game; therefore he made all possible speed after them: the Ferry boat being out of the way he made use of Canoo's: But by that time they had made two fraights, and had got over the Captain, and about 15 or 16 of his <HI>Indians,</HI> the Wind sprung up with such violence that Canoo's could no more pass. The Capt. seeing it was impossible for any more of his Souldiers to come to him, he told his <HI>Indians, If they were wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g to go with him, be would go to</HI> Poppasquash, <HI>and see if they could catch some of those Enemy</HI> Indians. They were willing to go, but were sorry they had no <HI>English</HI> Souldiers; so they March'd thro' the thickets that they might not be Discovered, until they came unto the Salt Meadow, to the Northward of <HI>Bristol</HI> Town, that now is. Then they heard a Gun, the Capt. look'd about, not knowing but it might be some of his own Company in the rear; so halting till they all came up, he found 'twas none of his own Company that fired. Now tho' he had but a few Men, was minded to send some of them out on a Scom. He moved it to Capt. <HI>Light foot</HI> to go with three more on a Scout; he said he was willing provided the Captains man <HI>Nathanael</HI> (which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an <HI>Indian</HI> that they had lately taken) might be one of them, because he was well acquainted with the Neck, and coming lately from among them, knew how to call them. The Capt. bid him choose his three companions, and go; and if they came a-cross any of the Enemy not to kill them if they could possibly take them alive; that they might gain intelligence concer∣ning <HI>Annawon.</HI> The Capt. with the rest of his company moved but a little way further toward <HI>Poppasquash,</HI> before they heard another Gun, which seem∣ed to be the same way with the other, but further off. But they made no ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> until they came unto the narrow of <HI>Poppasquash</HI> Neck; where Capt. <HI>Church</HI> left three men more, to watch if any should come out of the Neck, and to inform the Scout when they returned which way he was gone. He parted the remainder of his company, half on one side of the Neck, and the other with himself went on the other side of the Neck, until they met; and meeting neither with <HI>Indians</HI> nor Canoo's returned big with expectations of Tydings by their Scout: But when they came back to the three men at the arrow of the Neck, they told their Captain the Scout was not returned, had heard not seen any thing of them, this fill'd them with tho'ts what should become of them; by that time they had sat down &amp; waited an hour longer, it was very dark, and they despaired of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urning to them. Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> told their Captain, <HI>I boy feared his new man</HI> Nathanael <HI>had met with bis old</HI> Mount hope <HI>friends, and was turned Rogu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> They concluded to make
<PB N="47" REF="001800_0050_0FB82D0B8ED8E740"/>no fires that Night, (and indeed they had no great need of any) for they had no Victuals to cook, had not so much as a morsel of Bread with them. They took up their lodging scattering, that if possibly their Scout should come in the Night, and whistle (which was their sign) some or other of them might hear them. They had a very solitary, hungry Night; and as soon as the day broke they drew off thro' the brush to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hill without the Neck, and looking about them they espy'd one <HI>Indian</HI> man come running some what towards them, the Captain ordered one man to step out of the brush and show himself. Upon which the <HI>Indian</HI> ran right to him, and who should it be but Capt. <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> to their great joy. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> ask'd him, <HI>What News?</HI> He answered, <HI>Good News, they were all well and bad catch'd Ten</HI> Indians, <HI>and that they guarded them all Night in one of the Flanker; of the old</HI> Eng∣lish <HI>Garrison; that their Prisoners were part of</HI> Annawons <HI>company, and that they had left their Families in a Swamp above</HI> Mattapoiset Neck. And as they were Marching towards the old Garrison <HI>Lightfoot</HI> gave Capt. <HI>Church</HI> a particular account of their Exploit <HI>viz. That presently after they left him, they heard ano∣ther Gun, which seem'd to be towards the</HI> Indian <HI>burying place, &amp; moving that way, they discovered two of the Enemy fleeing of an Horse. The Scout claping into the brush,</HI> Nathanael <HI>bid them sit down, and he would presently call all the</HI> Indians <HI>there∣about unto him. They bid, and be went a little distance back from them and sat up his no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e &amp; bowled like a Wolf: One of the two immediately left his Horse &amp; came running to see who was there; but</HI> Nathanael <HI>bowling lower and lower drew him in between those that lay in wait for him, who seized him;</HI> Nathanael <HI>continuing the same note, the other left the Horse also following his mate, &amp; met with the same. When they caught these two they examined them apart, and found them to agree in their Story, that there were Eight more of them come down into the Neck to get Provisions, and bad agreed to meet at the burying place that evening. These two being some of</HI> Nathanaels <HI>old acquaintance, be had great influence upon there, and with bis inti∣ting Story, (telling what a brave Captain be had, how bravely he lived since be had been with him, &amp; how much they might better their condition by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, &amp;c.) perswaded and ingaged them to be on his side, which indeed now began to be the better side of the bedge. They waited but alittle while before they espy'd the rest of theirs coming up to the burying place, and</HI> Nathanael <HI>soon bowl'd them in as be had done their wates before.</HI> When Capt. <HI>Church</HI> came to the Garrison, he met his Liente∣nant and the rest of his Company; and then making up good fires they fell to roasting their Horse-beas, enough to last them the whole day, but had not a morsal of Bread; tho' Salt they had which they always carryed in their Pockets, which at this time was very acceptable to them. Their next motion was towards the place where the Prisoners told them they had left their Women and Children, and surprized them all, and some others that were newly come to them. And upon examination they held to one Story that it was hard to tell where to find <HI>Annawon,</HI> for he never roosted twice in
<PB N="48" REF="001800_0051_0FB82D0D233EF300"/>a place. Now a certain <HI>Indian</HI> Souldier that Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had gain'd one. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be on his side, pray'd that he might have liberty to go and fetch in his Fa∣ther, who he said was about four Miles from that place, in a <HI>Swamp</HI> with no other than one Young <HI>Squaw;</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> inclined to go with him, think∣ing it might be in his way to gain some intelligence of <HI>Annawon;</HI> and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king one <HI>English</HI> Man and a few <HI>Indians</HI> with him leaving the rest there, he went with his new Souldier to look his Father; when he came to the <HI>Swamp,</HI> he bid the <HI>Indian</HI> go see if he could find his Father: he was no sooner gone but Capt. <HI>Church</HI> discover'd a Track coming down out of the Woods, upon which he and his little company lay close some on one side of the Track &amp; some on the other. They heard the <HI>Indian</HI> Souldier make a howl∣ing for his Father; and at length some body answered him, but while they were listening, they thought they heard some body coming towards them, presently saw an old man coming up with a Gun on his Shoulder, and a young Woman following of him, in the Track which they lay by: They let them come up between them, and then started up and laid hold on them both. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> immediately examined them a part, telling them, <HI>What they must trust too if they told false Stories:</HI> He ask'd the young Woman, <HI>What company they came last from?</HI> She said, <HI>from Capt.</HI> Annawons. He asked her, <HI>How many were in company with him when she left him?</HI> She said, 50 <HI>or</HI> 60. He ask'd her, <HI>How many Miles it was to the place where she left him?</HI> She said, <HI>She did not understand Miles, but he was up in</HI> Squannaconk <HI>Swamp?</HI> The old man who had been one of <HI>Philips</HI> Council, upon examination, gave exactly the same account. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> ask'd him, <HI>If they could get there that Night?</HI> He said, <HI>If they went presently and travelled stoutly, they might get there by Sunset.</HI> He ask'd, <HI>Whither he was going?</HI> He answered, <HI>That</HI> Annawon <HI>had sent him down to look for some</HI> Indians, <HI>that were gone down into</HI> Mount-hope <HI>Neck to kill Pro∣visions:</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> let him know that those <HI>Indians</HI> were all his Prisoners. By this time came the <HI>Indian</HI> Souldier &amp; brought his Father and one <HI>Indian</HI> more. The Captain was now in great straight of mind what to do next he had a mind to give <HI>Annawon</HI> a visit, now knew where to find him, but his company was very small, but half a dozen men beside himself, and was under a necessity to send some body back to acquaint his Lieutenant &amp; company with his proceedings. However he asked his small company that were with him, <HI>Whither they would willingly go with him and give</HI> Annawon <HI>a visit:</HI> They told him, <HI>They were always ready to obey his commands.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut withal told him, <HI>That they knew this Capt.</HI> Annawon <HI>was a great Souldier; that he had been a va∣lia it Captain under</HI> Asuhmequn, Philips <HI>Father, and that he had been</HI> Philips <HI>Chieftain all this War; a very subtle man, and of great resolution, and had often said, that he would never be taking alive by the</HI> English; <HI>and moreover they knew that the men that were with him were resolute fellows, some of</HI> Philips <HI>chief Soulders; and therfore feared whether it was practicable to make an attempt upon him with so

Upon which he replyed. That he doubted not <HI>Annawon</HI> was a subtle &amp; valiant Man: that he had along time but in vain sought for him, and never till now could find his quarters and he was very loth to miss of the opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtunity; and doubt not but that if they would chearful∣ly go with him the same Almighty Providence the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had hitherto protected and befriended them would do so still, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon this with one consent they said, <HI>They would go.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> then turned to one <HI>Cock</HI> of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> (the only <HI>English</HI> Man then with him) and ask'd him, <HI>What he thought of it?</HI> Who replyed, <HI>Sir, I am never afraid of going any where when you are with me.</HI> Then Capt. <HI>Church</HI> asked the old <HI>Indian,</HI> if he could carry his Horse with him? (for he conveyed a Horse thus far with him:) He reply'd that it was impossible for an Horse to pass the Swamps. Therefore he sent away his new <HI>Indian</HI> Souldier with his Father and the Captains Horse to his Lieu∣tenant, and orders for him to move to <HI>Taunton</HI> with the Prisoners, to secure them there, and to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Morning in the <HI>Rehoboth</HI> Road, in which he might expect to meet him, if he were alive and had success. The Cap∣tain then asked the old fellow, if he would Pilot him unto <HI>Annawon?</HI> He answered, that he having given him his life he was obliged to serve him. He bid him move on then, and they followed: The old man would out-travel them, so far sometimes that they were almost out of sight: looking over his Shoulder and seeing them behind, he would halt. Just at the Sun was setting, the old man made a fall stop and sat down, the company co∣ming up also sat down, being all weary. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> asked, <HI>What News?</HI> He answered. That about that time in the Evening Capt. <HI>Annawon,</HI> sent out his Scouts to see if the Coast were clear, and as soon as it began to grow dark the Scouts return. And then (said he) we may move again securely. When it began to grow dark the old man stood up again, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> asked him, if he would take a Gun and fight for him? He bowed very low and pray'd him not to impose such a thing upon him, as to fight against Capt. <HI>Annawon</HI> his old friend. But sayes he, I will go along with you, and be helpful to you, and will lay hands on any man that shall offer to hurt you. It being now pretty dark they moved close together; anon they heard a noise, the Captain stay'd the old man with his hand, and asked his own men what noise they thought it might be? they concluded it to be the pound∣ding of a Mortar. The old man had given Capt. <HI>Church</HI> a description of the Place where <HI>Annowon</HI> now lay, and of the Difficulty of getting at him: be∣ing sensible that they were pretty near them, with two of his <HI>Indians</HI> he creeps to the edge of the Rocks, from whence he could see their Camps: he saw three companies of <HI>Indians</HI> as a little distance from each other, being easy to be discovered by the light of their fires. He saw also the great <HI>An∣nawon</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="001800_0053_0FB82D1033978118"/>and his company, who had formed his Camp or Kennelling place, by falling a Tree under the side of the great clefts of Rocks, and sitting a row of birch bushes up against it, where he himself, and his Son, and some of his chiefs had taken up their lodging, and made great fires without them, and had their Pots and Kittles boiling, and Spits roasting. Their Arms also he discovered, all set together in a place fitted for the purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an end against a stick lodged in two crotches, and a Mat placed over them, to keep them from the wet or dew. The old <HI>Annawons</HI> feet and his Sons head were so near the Arms as almost to touch them: But the Rocks were so treep that it was impossible to get down, but as they lowered themselves by the bows, and the bushes that grew in the cracks of the Rock. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> creeping back again to the old man, asked him If there was no pos∣sibility of getting at them some other way? He answered, no. That he and all that belonged to <HI>Annawon</HI> were ordered to come that way, and none could come any other way without difficulty or danger of being shot. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> then ordered the old man and his daughter to go down fore most with their baskets at their backs, that when <HI>Annawon</HI> saw them with their baskets he should not mistrust the intregue; Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his handful of Souldiers crept down also under the shadow of these two and their bas∣kets, and the Captain himself crept close behind the old man, with his Hat∣chet in his hand, and step'd over the young mans head to the Arms, the young <HI>Annawon</HI> discovering of him, whip'd his blanket over his head and shrunk up in a heap: The old Capt. <HI>Annawon</HI> started up on his breech, and cryed out <HI>Howoh,</HI> and despairing of escape throw himself back again, and lay silent until Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had secured all the Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And having se∣cured that company, he sent his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers to the other fires &amp; com∣panies, giving them instructions, what to do and say. Accordingly, they went into the midst of them: When they discovered themselves who they were, told them that their Capt. <HI>Annawon</HI> was taken, and it would be best for them quietly and peaceably to surrender themselves, which would pro∣cure good quarter for them: Otherwise if they should pretend to resist or make their escape, it would be in vain, and they could expect no other but that Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with his great Army, who had now entrap'd them, would cut them to pieces: told them also if they would submit themselves, and deliver up all their Arms unto them, and keep every man his place un∣til it was day; they would assure them that their Capt. <HI>Church</HI> who had been so kind to themselves when they surrendred to him, should be as kind unto them. Now they being old acquaintance, and many of them Relations did much the readier give heed to what they said, and complyed &amp; surrendred up their Arms unto them, both their Guns and Hatchets <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and were forth∣with carryed to Capt. <HI>Church.</HI> Things being so far settled, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> asked <HI>Annawon,</HI> What he had for Supper, for (said he) I am come to Sup
<PB N="51" REF="001800_0054_0FB82D11CD624118"/>with you. <HI>Tanbut</HI> (said <HI>Annawon</HI>) with a big voices, and looking about upon his Women, bid them hasten and get Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his company some Supper; then turned to Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and asked him, Whether he would eat Cow-beaf or Horse beaf. The Captain told him Cow-beaf would be most acceptable: It was soon got ready, and pulling his little bag of Salt out of his Pocket, which was all the Provision he brought with him; this season'd his Cow beaf so that with it and the dry'd green-corn, which the old Squaw was pounding in the Mortar, while they were sliding down the Rocks, he made a very hearty Supper. And this pounding in the Mortar proved lucky for Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> getting down the Rocks, for when the old Squaw pounded they moved, and when she ceased to turn the corn, they ceased creeping, the noise of the Mortar prevented the Enemies hearing their creeping: and the corn being now dressed supplyed the want of Bread, and gave a fine relish with the Cow-beaf. Supper being over, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> sent two of his men to inform the other companies, that he had killed <HI>Philip,</HI> and had taken their friends in <HI>Mount-hope</HI> Neck, but had spared their lives, and that he had subdued now all the Enemy (he supposed) excepting this company of <HI>Annawons,</HI> and now if they would be orderly and keep their places until Morning, they should have good quarter, and that he would carry them to <HI>Taunton,</HI> where they might see their friends again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Messengers return'd, that the <HI>Indians</HI> yielded to his proposals. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> tho't it was now time for him to take a Nap, having had no sleep in two days and one night before; told his men that if they would let him sleep two hours, they should sleep all the reft of the night. He lay'd himself down and endeavoured to sleep, but all disposition to sleep departed from him. After he had lain a little while he looked up to see how his Watch managed, but found them all fast a-sleep. Now Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had told Capt, <HI>Annawons</HI> company as he had ordered his <HI>Indians</HI> to tell the others, that their lives should all be spared, excepting Capt. <HI>Annawons,</HI> and it was not in his power to promise him his life, but he must carry him to his Masters at <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> and he would intreat them for his life. Now when Capt. <HI>Church</HI> found not only his own men, but all the <HI>Indians</HI> fast a-sleep <HI>Annawon</HI> only excepted, whom he perceived was as broad awake as himself; and so they lay looking one upon the other perhaps an hour; Capt. <HI>Church</HI> said nothing to him, for he could not speak <HI>Indian,</HI> and tho't <HI>Annawon</HI> could not speak <HI>English;</HI> at length <HI>Annawon</HI> raised himself up, cast off his blanket, and with no more clothes than his small breeches, walked a little way back from the company: Capt. <HI>Church</HI> tho't no other but that he had occasion to ease him∣self, and so walked to some distance rather than offend him with the stink: but by and by he was gone out of sight and hearing; and then Capt. <HI>Church</HI> began to suspect some ill design in him, and got all the Guns close him, and crouded himself close under young <HI>Annawon,</HI> that if he should any where
<PB N="52" REF="001800_0055_0FB82D1375BF0880"/>get a Gun he should not make a sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him without indangering his Son; lying very still a while waiting for the event: at length, he heard some body, coming the same way that <HI>Annawon</HI> went. The Moon now shining bright, he saw him at a distance coming with something in his hands, and coming up to Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> he fell upon his knees before him, and offer'd him what he had bro't, and speaking in plain <HI>English,</HI> said, <HI>Great Captain, you have killed</HI> Philip, <HI>and conquered his Country for I believe, that I &amp; my company are the last that War against the</HI> English, <HI>so suppose the War is ended by your means; and therefore these things belong unto you.</HI> Then opening his pack, he pull'd out <HI>Philip:</HI> belt curiously wrought with <HI>Wompom,</HI> being Nine inches broad, wrought with black and white <HI>Wompom,</HI> in various figures and flowers, and pictures of many birds and beasts. This when hung upon Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> shoulders it reach'd his ancles. And another belt of <HI>Wompom</HI> he presented him with, wrought after the former manner, which <HI>Philip</HI> was wont to put upon his head; it had two flags on the back part which hung down on his back: and another small belt with a Star upon the end of it, which he used to hang on his breast; and they were all edg'd with red hair, which <HI>Annawon</HI> said they got in the Muhhogs Country. Then he pulled out two horns of glazed Powder, and a red cloth Blanket: he told Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> these were <HI>Philips</HI> Royalties which he was wont to adorn himself with when he sat in State. That the tho't himself happy that he had an opportunity to present them to Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> who had won them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> spent the remainder of the night in discourse; and gave an account of what mighty success he had formerly in Wars against many Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> when served <HI>Asu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mequin, Philips</HI> Fa∣ther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Morning as soon as it was light, the Captain March'd with his Prisoners out of that <HI>Swampy</HI> Country towards <HI>Taunton,</HI> met his Lieute∣nant and Company, about four Miles out of Town, who expressed a great deal of joy to see him again, and said, 'twas more than ever he expected. They went into <HI>Taunton,</HI> were civily and kindly treated by the Inhabitants, refreshed and refted themselves that night. Early next Morning, the Cap∣tain took old <HI>Annawon,</HI> and half a dozen of his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers, and his own man, and went to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> sending the reft of his Company and his Pri∣soners by his Lieutenant to <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Tarrying two or three days upon the Island, he then went to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and carryed his Wife and his two Chil∣dren with him.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had been but a little while at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> before he was infor∣med of a parcel of <HI>Indians,</HI> that haunted the Woods between <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Sippican</HI> that did great damage to the <HI>English</HI> in killing their Cattel, Horses, and Swine; and the Captain was soon in pursuit of them: Went out from <HI>Plymouth</HI> the next Monday in the afternoon; next Morning early they dis∣covered a Track; the Captain sent two <HI>Indians</HI> on the Track to see what they could discover, while he and his Company followed gently after, but
<PB N="53" REF="001800_0056_0FB82D14F66E4F98"/>the two <HI>Indians</HI> soon returned with Tydings that they had discovered the Enemy sitting round their fires, in a thick place of brush. When they came pretty near the place, the Captain ordered every man to creep as he did; and surround them by creeping as near as they could, till they should be dis∣covered, and then to run on upon them and take them alive, if possible, (for their Prisoners were their pay:) They did so, took every one that was at the fires, not one escaping. Upon examination they agreed in their Story, that they belonged to <HI>Tispaquin,</HI> who was gone with <HI>John Bump,</HI> and one more, to <HI>Agawom</HI> and <HI>Sippican</HI> to kill Horses, and were not expected back in two or three days. This same <HI>Tispaquin</HI> had been a great Captain, and the <HI>Indians</HI> reported that he was such a great <HI>Pouwau,</HI> that no bullet could enter him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> said, He would not have him killed, for there was a War broke out in the Eastern Part of the Country, and he would have him saved to go with them to fight the <HI>Eastern Indians.</HI> Agreeably he left two old Squaws of the Prisoners, and bid them tarry there until their Capt. <HI>Tispaquin</HI> returned, and to tell him, that <HI>Church</HI> had been there, and had taken his Wife, Children, and company, and carryed them down to <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and would spare all their lives, and his too, if he would come down to them and bring the other two that were with him, and they should be his Souldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> then returned to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> leaving the old Squaws well provided for, and Bisket for <HI>Tispaquin</HI> when he returned: Telling his Soul∣diers, that he doubted not but he had laid a Trap that would take him Capt. <HI>Church</HI> two days after went to <HI>Boston;</HI> (the Commissioners then sitting) and waited upon the Honourable Governour <HI>Leverett,</HI> who then lay Sick; who requested of Capt. <HI>Church</HI> to give him some account of the War: who readily obliged his Honour therein, to his great Satisfaction, as he was plea∣sed to express himself; taking him by the hand, and telling him, if it plea∣sed God he lived, he would make it a brace of a hundred pounds advantage to him out of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Colony, and would endeavour the reft of the Colonies should do Proportionably; but he dyed within a Fortnight af∣ter, and so nothing was done of that nature. The same day <HI>Tispaquin</HI> came in and those that were with him, but when Capt. <HI>Church</HI> return'd from <HI>Boston,</HI> he found to his grief that the heads of <HI>Annawon, Tispaquin, &amp;c.</HI> cut off, which were the last of <HI>Philips</HI> friends. The General Court of <HI>Plymouth</HI> then sitting sent for Capt. <HI>Church</HI> who waited upon them accordingly, and recei∣ved their Thanks for his good Service, which they Unanimously Voted, which was all that Capt. <HI>Church</HI> had for his aforesaid Service.</P>
<P>Afterwards in the Year 1676. in the Month of <HI>January</HI> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> re∣ceived a Commission from Governour <HI>Winslow,</HI> to Scoure the Woods of some of the lurking Enemy, which they were well informed were there. Which Commission is as follows:</P>

He going to Capt. <HI>Davis</HI>'s to get some refreshment, having not eat a Morsel since he came by <HI>Boston</HI> Castle; and now having inquired into the State of the Town, found them in a poor condition for to defend themselves against such a number of Enemies: He gave them an account of his Orders and Instructions and told them what Forces he had brought, and that when it was dark they should all Land, and not before, lest the Enemy should discover them.

He then having got what intelligence she could give him, went ashore and viewed the Fort and Town, discoursing with the Gentlemen there according to his Instructions; and when it began to grow dark, he ordered the Vessels to come as near the Fort as might be, and Land the Souldiers, with as little noise as possible; ordering them as they Landed to go into the Fort and Houses that stood near, that so they night be ready upon occasion; having ordered Provisions for them, went to every Company and ordering them to get every thing ready; they that had no Powder-horns nor Shot-bags, should immediately make them; or∣dering the Officers to take special care that they were ready to March into the Woods an hour before day: and also directing the Watch to call him two hours before day; so he hastned to bed to get some Rest. At the time prefix'd he was call'd, and presently ordering the Company's to make ready, and about half an hour before day they mov'd; several of the Town Peo∣ple went with them into a thick place of brush, about half a Mile from the Town; now ordering them to send out their Scouts, as they us'd to do, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing them all settled at their work, he went into Town by Sun rise again, and desired the Inhabitants to take care of themselves, till his men had fitted themselves with some necessaries: for his <HI>Indians</HI> most of them wanted both bags and horns; so he ordered them to make bags like Wallets to put Pow∣der in one end and shot in the other: So most of them were ready for action <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>Seconet Indians,</HI> but the <HI>Cape Indians</HI> were very bare, lying so long at <HI>Boston</HI> before they imbark'd, that they had Sold every thing they could make a Peny of; some tying Shot &amp; Powder in the corners of their Blankets. He being in Town, just going to Breakfast, there was an Alarm, so he ordered all the Souldiers in the Town to Move away as fast as they could, where the firing was; and he with what Men more were with him of his Souldiers, Mov'd immediately, and meeting with Capt. <HI>Brackits</HI> Sons, who told him their Father was taken, and that they saw a great Army of <HI>Indians</HI> in their Fathers Orchard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By this time our <HI>Indians</HI> that wanted bags and horns were fitted, but wanted more Ammunition: presently came a Messenger to him from the Town &amp; inform'd him, That they had knock'd out the heads of several Casks of Bullets and they were all too big, being Musket Bullets, and would not fit their Guns, and that if he did not go back himself a great part of the Army would be kept back from Service for want of suitable Bullets: He run back and ordered every Vessel to send a∣shore all their Casks of Bullets; being brought, knock'd out their heads, and turn'd them all out upon the green by the Fort, and set all the People in the Town that were able to make slugs; being most of them too large for their use, which had like to have been the over-throw of their whole Army: He finding some small Bullets and what slugs were made, and three Snap-sacks of Powder, went immediately to the Army, who were very hotly in∣gag'd;
<PB N="62" REF="001800_0065_0FB82D28E2851CC8"/>but coming to the River, the Tide was up; he call'd to his men that were ingag'd, incouraging them, and told them he had brought more Ammunition for them. An <HI>Indian</HI> call'd Capt. <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> laid down his Gun, and came over the River, taking the Powder upon his head and a Kittle of Bullets in each hand, and got safe to his Fellow Souldiers: He pen∣ceiving great firing upon that side he was of, went to see who they were, and found them to be two of Maj <HI>Church</HI>'s Companies, one of <HI>English</HI> &amp; the other of <HI>Indians,</HI> being in all about Fourscore Men, that had not got over the River, but lay firing over our Mens heads at the Enemy; he presently or∣dered them to Rally and come all together; and gave the word for a <HI>Casco</HI> Man: So one <HI>Swarton</HI> a <HI>Jersey</HI> man appearing, who he could hardly under∣stand; he ask'd him, How far it was to the head of the River? or whether there was any place they could get over? He said, there was a Bridge about three quarters of a Mile up where they might get over: So he calling to his Souldiers ingag'd on the other side, that he would soon be with them over the Bridge, and come upon the backs of the Enemy; which put, new courage into them; so they immediately Mov'd up towards the Bridge▪ Marching very thin, being willing to make what show they could, shouting as they March'd: they saw the Enemy running from the River-side, where they had made Stands with Wood to prevent any body from coming over the River; and coming to the Bridge, they saw on the other side that the Enemy had laid logs and stuck birch brush along to hide themselves from our view. He ordered the Company to come all together, ordering them all to run after him, who would go first, and that as soon as they got over the Bridge to scatter, that so they might not be all shot down together, ex∣pecting the Enemy to be at their Stands; so running up to the Stands, found none there, but were just gone, the ground being much tumbled with them behind the said Stands: He order'd the Captain with his Company of <HI>English</HI> to March down to our Men ingag'd, and that they should keep along upon the edge of the Marsh, and himself with his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers would March down thro' the brush: and coming to a parcel of low ground which had been formerly burnt, the old brush being fallen down lay very thick, and young brush being grown up made it bad travelling; but coming near the back of the Enemy, one of his Men call'd unto him their Commander, and said, That the Enemy run <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stward</HI> to get between us and the Bridge, and he looking that way saw men running, and making a small stop, heard no firing, but a great chopping with Hatchess; so concluding the fight was over, made the best of their way to the Bridge again; left the Enemy should go over the Bridge into the Town. The men being most of them out (our Ammunition lay expos'd) coming to the Bridge where he had left Six <HI>In∣dians</HI> for an Amboscade on the other side of the River, that if any Enemy effec'd to come over they should fire at them, which would give him Notice,
<PB N="63" REF="001800_0066_0FB82D2AAC9CF5A0"/>so would come to their assistance; (but in the way having heard no firing nor shouting, concluded the Enemy were drawn off) he asked the Ambos∣cade, whether they saw any <HI>Indians?</HI> They said, Yes, abundance. He ask'd them, Where? They answered, That they ran over the head of the River by the Cedar Swamp, and were running into the Neck towards the Town: There being but one <HI>English</HI> man with him, he bid his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers scat∣ter, run very thin to preserve themselves and the better able to make a dis∣covery of the Enemy: &amp; soon coming to Lieut. <HI>Clarks</HI> field on the South side of the Neck, and seeing the Cattel feeding quietly, and perceiving no Track, concluded the Amboscade had told them a falsehood; they hastily return'd back to the said Bridge, perceiving there was no noise of the Enemy. He hearing several great Guns fire at the Town, concluded that they were either assaulted or that they had discover'd the Enemy: He having ordered that in case such should be, that they should fire some of their great Guns to give him notice; he being a Stranger to the Country, concluded the Enemy had by some other way got to the Town: whereupon he sent his Men to the Town, and himself going to the River, near where the fight had been; ask'd them how they did? and what was become of the Enemy? who inform'd him that the Enemy drew off in less than an hour after he left them, and had not fired a Gun at them since. He told them he had been within little more than a Gun shot of the back of the Enemy, and had been upon them had it not been for the thick brushy ground, &amp;c. Now some of his Men returning from the Town gave him the account, that they went while they saw the Colours standing &amp; Men walking about as not molested. He presently ordered that all his Army should pursue the Enemy: But they told him that most of them had spent their Ammunition, and that if the Enemy had engaged them a little longer they might have come &amp; knock'd them on the head; and that some of their Bullets were so unsizeable that some of them were forc'd to make slugs while they were ingag'd. He then order'd them to get over all the wounded and dead men, and to leave none behind: which was done by some Canoo's they had got. Capt. <HI>Hall</HI> and his men being first ingaged did great Service, and suffered the greatest loss in his Men. But Capt. <HI>Southworth</HI> with his Company, &amp; Capt. <HI>Numposh</HI> with the <HI>Seconis Indians,</HI> and the most of the men belonging to the Town all co∣ming suddenly to his relief, prevented him and his whole Company from being cut off, &amp;c. By this time the day was far spent, and Marching into Town about Sun-set, carrying in all their wounded and dead men; being all sensible of Gods goodness to them, in giving them the Victory, and cau∣sing the Enemy to fly with shame, who never gave one shout at their draw∣ing off. The poor Inhabitants wonderfully rejoyced that the Almighty had favoured them so much: saying, That if Maj. <HI>Church</HI> with his Forces had not come at that juncture of time, they had been all cut off; and said fur∣ther
<PB N="64" REF="001800_0067_0FB82D304E9F83D8"/>That it was the first time that ever the <HI>Eastward Indians</HI> had been put to flight, and the said <HI>Church</HI> with his Volunteers were wonderfully preser∣ved, having never a man kill'd out right, and but one <HI>Indian</HI> mortally wound∣ed, who dy'd, several more being badly wounded, but recovered.</P>
<P>After this ingagement Maj <HI>Church</HI> with his Forces ranging all the Coun∣try: thereabout, in pursuit of the Enemy; and visiting all the Garrisons, at <HI>Black Point, Spurwink,</HI> and <HI>Blew Point;</HI> and went up <HI>Kenneb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck</HI> River, but to little effect. And now Winter drawing near, he received orders from the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts. Bay,</HI> to settle all the Garrisons, and put in suitable Officers according to his best discretion, and to send home all his Souldiers the Volunteers and transports; which orders he presently attend∣ed. Being oblig'd to buy him a Horse to go home by land, that so he might the better comply with his orders. The poor People the Inhabitants of <HI>Casco</HI> and Places Adjacent, when they saw he was going away from them, lamented sadly, &amp; beg'd earnestly that he would suffer them to come away in the Transports; saying if he left them there, that in the Spring of the Year the Enemy would come and destroy 'em and their Families, &amp;c. So by their earnest request the said Maj. <HI>Church</HI> promised them, that if the Go∣vernments that had now sent him, would send him the next Spring, he would certainly come with his Volunteers and <HI>Indians</HI> to their relief: And that as soon as he had been at home, and taken a little care of his own business, he would certainly wait upon the Gentlemen of <HI>Boston,</HI> and inform them of the Promise he had made to them; and if they did not see cause to send 'em relief, to intreat their Honours seasonably to draw them off, that they might not be a prey to the barbarous Enemy. Taking his leave of those poor In∣habitants some of the chief men there waited upon him to <HI>Black Point,</HI> to Capt <HI>Scottaways</HI> Gartison; coming there they prevail'd with the said Capt. <HI>Scottaway</HI> to go with him to <HI>Boston,</HI> which he readily comply'd with, provi∣ded the said <HI>Church</HI> would put another in to Command the Garrison; which being done and taking their leaves one of another, they set out and travel∣led thro' all the Country home to <HI>Boston:</HI> (having imploy'd himself to the utmost to fulfill his Instructions last received from <HI>Boston</HI> Gentlemen, which cost him about a Months Service more and above what he had pay from <HI>Plymouth</HI> Gentlemen) and in his travel homeward several Gentlemen wait∣ed upon the said Maj <HI>Church</HI> who was oblig'd to bare their Expences. When he came to <HI>Boston</HI> Gentlemen, he inform'd them of the miseries those poor People were in by having their Provisions taken from them by order of the President, &amp;c. Then went home; staid not long there before he return'd to <HI>Boston,</HI> where Capt. <HI>Scottaway</HI> waited for his coming, that he might have tge determination the Government of <HI>Boston</HI> to carry home with him; and it being the time of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> there (and Maj <HI>Church</HI> not having had it) taking up his Lodging near the Court-house, took the first opportunity
<PB N="65" REF="001800_0068_0FB82D34BAB62E90"/>to inform those Gentlemen of the Court his business; who said they were very busy in sending home Sir <HI>Edmund</HI> the Ship being ready to Sail. The said Maj. <HI>Church</HI> still wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing upon them, and at every opportunity intrea∣ting those Gentlemen in the behalf of the poor People of <HI>Casco,</HI> informing them the necessity of taking care of them either by sending them relief early in the Spring, or suffer them to draw off, otherwise they would certainly be destroyed, &amp;c. There answer was, They could do nothing till Sir <HI>Ed∣mund</HI> was gone. Waiting there three weeks upon great expences, he con∣cluded to draw up some of the circumstances of <HI>Casco</HI> and Places Adjacent, and to leave it upon the Council-Board, before the Governour &amp; Council; having got it done, obtained liberty to go up where the Governour and Council was sitting, he inform'd their Honours, that he had waited till his Patience was wore out; so had drawn up the matter to leave upon the Board before them: which is as follows.</P>

Upon my them Removal from the Province of</HI> Maine, <HI>the Inhabitants were very Solicitous that this Enemy might be further Prosecuted, wiling to venture their Lives and Fortunes in said Enterprize, wherein they might serve God, their King and Country, and injoy Quiet &amp; Peacrable Habitations; Upon which I promised to signifie the same to Your Selves, and willing to ventue that little which Providence hath betrusted me with on the said account. The Season of the Year being, such if some speedy Action be not performed in Attacking them, they will certainly be upon us in our Out Towns (God knows where) and the Inhabitants there being not akle to Defend themselves, without doubt many Souls may be cut off, as our last Years Experience wofully hath declared; The Inhabitants there trust to your Protection, having undertaken Government and your Propriety; If nothing be performed on the said account (The best way under Cor∣rection) is to Demolish the Garrison, and draw off the Inhabitants, that they may not be left to a Merciless Enemy; and that the Arms and Ammunition may not be there left for the strengthning of the Enemy; who without doubt have need enough, having exhausted their greatest Store in this Winter Season: I have performed my Promise to them, and acquitted my self in Specisring the same to your selves: Not that I desire to be in any Action (altho' willing to serve my King &amp; Country) and may pass under the censure of Scandalous Tongues in the last Expedition, which I hope they with amend on the first opportunity of Service.

<P>Maj <HI>Church</HI> said moreover that in thus doing he had comply'd with his Promise to those poor People of <HI>Casco,</HI> and should be quit from the guilt of their bloud: the Governour was pleased to Thank him for his care &amp; pains taken.

<HEAD>The Second Expedition, <HI>East.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1690. was the Expedition to <HI>Canada,</HI> and Maj. <HI>Walley</HI> often re∣quested Maj <HI>Church</HI> that if he would not go himself in that Expedition, that he would not hinder others: He answered the said <HI>Walley,</HI> That he should hinder none but his old Souldiers, that us'd to go along with him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the said Church going down to <HI>Charlestown</HI> to take his leave of some of his Relations, and Friends, who were going in that Expedition, promised his Wife and Family not to go into <HI>Boston,</HI> the Small Pox being very brief there. Coming to <HI>Charlestown,</HI> several of his Friends in <HI>Boston</HI> came over to see him; and the next day after the said <HI>Church</HI> came there, Maj. <HI>Walley</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="001800_0070_0FB82D371FEF2008"/>came to him, and inform'd him, That the Governour and Council wanted to speak with him: He answered him, That he had promis'd his Wife and Family not to go into <HI>Boston;</HI> saying, If they had any business, they could Write to him, and that he would send them his answer. Soon after came over two other Gentlemen with a Message, that the Governour &amp; Council wanted to have some discourse with him. The answer return'd was, That he intended to lodge that Night at the <HI>Gray-bound,</HI> in <HI>Roxbury,</HI> and that in the Morning would come to <HI>Pollards</HI> at the South End of <HI>Boston;</HI> which ac∣cordingly he did: soon after he came thither received a Letter from the Honourable Capt. <HI>Sewall,</HI> to request him to come to the Council; the an∣swer he return'd by the bearer was, That he thought there was no need of his hazarding himself so much as to come &amp; speak with them; not that he was afraid of his Life, but because he had no mind to be concern'd any fur∣ther, by reason they would not hearken to him about the poor People of <HI>Casco.</HI> But immediately came Mr. <HI>Maxfield</HI> to him, saying, That the Coun∣cil bid him tell the said <HI>Church,</HI> That if he would take his Horse and ride along the middle of the Street there might be no danger, they were then sitting in Council: He bid him go and tell his Masters. Not to trouble them∣selves, whether he came upon his head or feet, he was coming: however thinking the return was something rude, call'd him back to drink a Glass of Wine, and then he would go with him. So coming to the Council, They were very thankful to him for his coming; and told him that the occasion of their sending for him was, That there was a Captive come in who gave them an account. That the <HI>Indians</HI> were come down and had taken posses∣sion of the Stone Fort at <HI>Pejepscot,</HI> so that they wanted his advice &amp; thoughts about the matter; whither they would tarry and keep in that Fort or not? and whither it was not expedient to send some Forces to do some spoil up∣on them; and further to know whither he could not be prevail'd with to Raise some Volunteers and go, to do some spoil upon them? He answer'd them, he was unwilling to be concern'd any more; it being very difficult and chargeable to Raise Volunteers, as he found by experience in the last Expedition. But they using many arguments prevail'd so far with him, That if the Government of <HI>Plymouth</HI> saw cause to send him (he would go) think∣ing the Expedition would be short. Took his leave of them &amp; went home. And in a short time after there came an Express from Governour <HI>Hinkley,</HI> to request Maj <HI>Church</HI> to come down to <HI>Barnstable</HI> to him: he having recei∣ved a Letter from the Government of <HI>Boston</HI> to raise some Forces to go <HI>East;</HI> whereupon the said Maj. <HI>Church</HI> went the next day to <HI>Barnstable,</HI> as ordered; finding the Governour and some of the Council of War there, discous'd him, concluding that he should take his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers, and two <HI>English</HI> Captains with what Volunteers as could be raised; and that one Capt should go our of <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Barnstable</HI> County, and the other out of <HI>Bristol</HI> County, with
<PB N="68" REF="001800_0071_0FB82D38B932A3A0"/>what Forces he could raise, concluding to have but few Officers to save Charge: the said <HI>Church</HI> was at great Charge &amp; Expence in raising of Forces. Governour <HI>Hinkley</HI> promised that he would take care to provide Vessels to transport the said Army with Ammuniton &amp; Provisions, by the time prefixt by himself for the Government of <HI>Boston</HI> had oblig'd themselves by their Let∣ter, to provide any thing that was wanting; so at the time prefirt Major <HI>Church</HI> March'd down all his Souldiers out of <HI>Bristol</HI> County to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> as ordered; and being come, found it not as he expected, for there was neither Provisions, Ammunition nor Transports; so he immediately sent an Express to the Governour who was at <HI>Barnstable,</HI> to give him an account that he with the Men were come to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and found nothing ready; in his return to the said <HI>Church,</HI> gave him an account of his disappointments; and sent <HI>John Lathrop</HI> of <HI>Barnstable</HI> in a Vessel with some Ammunition and Provision on board, to him at <HI>Plymouth;</HI> also sent him word that there was more on board of <HI>Samuel Alling</HI> of <HI>Barnstable,</HI> who was to go for a Transport, and that he himself would be at <HI>Plymouth</HI> the next day: but <HI>Alling</HI> never came near him, but went to <HI>Billings-gate</HI> at <HI>Cape-cod,</HI> as he was inform'd. The Gover∣nour being come, said to Maj. <HI>Church</HI> that he must take some of the open Sloops, and make Spar-Decks to them, and lay Platforms for the Souldiers to lye upon; which delays were very Expensive to the said <HI>Church;</HI> his Souldiers being all Volunteers, daily expected to be treated by him, and the <HI>Indians</HI>-always begging for Money to get drink: but he using his utmost diligence, made what dispatch he could to be gone.

<P>Being ready, they took the first opportunity and made the best of their way to <HI>Pejepscot</HI> Fort, where they found nothing. From thence they March'd to <HI>Ameras-cogen,</HI> and when they came near the Fort Maj. <HI>Church</HI> made a halt, ordering the Captains to draw out of their several Companies 60 of their meanest men, to be a guard to the Doctor &amp; Snapsacks; being not a Mile from said Fort; and then Moving towards the Fort, they saw young <HI>Doney</HI> and his Wife, with two <HI>English</HI> Captives: the said <HI>Doney</HI> made his escape to the Fort, his Wife was shot down, and so the two poor Captives releas'd out of their bondage. The said Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and Capt. <HI>Walton</HI> made no stop, making the best of their way to the Fort with some of the Army, in hopes of getting to the Fort before young <HI>Doney;</HI> but the River thro' which they must pass being as deep as their Arm-pits; however Maj. <HI>Church</HI> as soon as he was got over strip'd to his Shirt and Jacket, leaving his Breeches behind, ran directly to the Fort, having an eye to see if young <HI>Doney,</HI> who ran on the other side of the River should get there before him: the Wind now blowing very hard in their Faces as they ran was some help to them; for several of our Men fired Guns, which they in the Fort did not hear; so that we had taken all in the Fort had it not been for young <HI>Doney,</HI> who got to the Fort just before we did, who ran into the South Gate, and out at the
<PB N="72" REF="001800_0075_0FB82D46296BDDD8"/>North, all the Men following him except one, who all ran directly down to the great River and Falls. The said <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces being come pretty near, he ordered the said <HI>Walton</HI> to run directly with some Forces in∣to the Fort and himself with the rest ran down to the River after the Ene∣my, who ran some of them into the River, and the rest under the great Falls; those who ran into the River were kill'd, for he saw but one man get over, and he only crept up the bank, and there lay in open sight; and those that ran under the Falls they made no discovery of notwithstanding several of his men went in under the said Falls, and was gone some conside∣rable time; could not find them; so leaving a Watch there, return'd up to the Fort, where he found but one Man taken &amp; several Women &amp; Children, amongst which was Capt. <HI>Hakins</HI> Wife &amp; <HI>Worumbes's</HI> Wife, the Sachem of that Fort, with their Children; the said <HI>Hakins</HI> was the Sachem of <HI>Pen∣nacook,</HI> who destroyed Maj <HI>Walden</HI> and his Family, some time before, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The said two Women, <HI>viz. Hakins</HI> and <HI>Worumbes's</HI> Wives, requested the said <HI>Church</HI> that he would spare them and their Children's lives, promising upon that condition, he should have all the Captives that were taken, and in the <HI>Indians</HI> hands: He ask'd them, How many? they said about fourscore: So upon that condition he promis'd them their lives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in the said Fort there was several <HI>English</HI> Captives, who were in a miserable condition; a∣mongst whom was Capt. <HI>Huckings</HI>'s Wife of <HI>Oyster-River.</HI> Maj. <HI>Church</HI> pro∣ceeded to examine the Man taken, who gave him an account that most of their fighting men were gone to <HI>Winter-harbour,</HI> to provide Provisions for the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Fondy Indians,</HI> who were to come and joyn with them to fight the <HI>English.</HI> The Souldiers being very rude would hardly spare the <HI>Indians</HI> life, while in examination, intending when he had done that he should be Exe∣cuted: but Capt. <HI>Huckings</HI> Wife and another Woman down on their knee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beg'd for him saying, He had been a means to save their Lives and a great many more; and had helped several to opportunities to run away &amp; make their escape; and that never since he came amongst them had fought against the <HI>English,</HI> but being related to <HI>Hakins</HI> Wife kept at the Fort with them, he having been there two Years; but his living was to the westward of <HI>Boston.</HI> So upon their request his life was spared, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Next day the said <HI>Church,</HI> ordered that all their Corn should be destroy'd, being a great quantity, sa∣ving a little for the two old <HI>Squaws</HI> which he design'd to leave at the Fort to give an account who he was, and from whence he came: the rest being knock'd on the head, except what afore-mentioned, for an example, ordering thern to be all buried. Having enquired where all their best Bever was? They said, it was carried away to make a present to the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Fondy Indians,</HI> who were coming to their Assistance. Now being ready to draw off from thence, he call'd the two old Squaws to him, and gave each of them a Kit∣tle and some Biskets, biding them to tell the <HI>Indians</HI> when they came home,
<PB N="73" REF="001800_0076_0FB82D47AA67D1D8"/>that he was known by the Name of Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> and liv'd in the Westerly part of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Government; and that those <HI>Indians</HI> that came with him were formerly King <HI>Philips</HI> Men, and that he had met with them in <HI>Philips</HI> War, and drew them off from him, to sight for the <HI>English</HI> against the said <HI>Philip</HI> and his Associates, who then promised him to sight for the <HI>English</HI> as long as they had one Enemy left; and said, that they did not question but before Indian Corn was ripe to have <HI>Philips</HI> head, notwithstanding he had twice as many men as was in their Country; and that they had kill'd and taken one thousand three hundred and odd of <HI>Philips</HI> Men, Women &amp; Chil∣dren, and <HI>Philip</HI> himself, with several other Sachems, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that they should tell <HI>Hakins</HI> &amp; <HI>Worumbo,</HI> That if they had a mind to see their Wives &amp; Chil∣dren they should come to <HI>Wells</HI> Garrison, and that there they might hear of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Maj. <HI>Church</HI> having done, Mov'd with all his Forces down to <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quoyt,</HI> where the transports were (but in the way some of his Souldiers threatned the <HI>Indian</HI> man Prisoner, very much, so that in a thick Swamp he gave them the slip and got away) and when they all got on board the transport; the Wind being fair made the best of their way for <HI>Winter Harbour</HI> and the next Morning before day, and as soon as the day appear'd they dis∣covered some Smokes rising towards <HI>Skamans</HI> Garrison: He immediately sent away a Scout of 60 Men, and follow'd presently with the whole body; the Scout coming near a River discovered the Enemy to be on the other side of the River: But three of the Enemy was come over the River to the same side of the River which the Scout was of; ran hastily down to their Canoo, two of which lay at each end of the Canoo, and the third stood up to pad∣dle over: The Scout fired at them, and he that paddled fell down upon the Canoo and broke it to pieces, so that all three perished; the siring put the Enemy to the run, who left their Canoo's and Provisions to ours; and old <HI>Doney,</HI> and one <HI>Thomas Baker</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Man who was a Prisoner amongst them, were up at the Falls and heard the Guns fire, expected the other <HI>In∣dians</HI> were come to their Assistance, so came down the River in a Canoo, but when they perceived that there was <HI>English</HI> as well as <HI>Indians,</HI> old <HI>Doney</HI> run the Canoo a shore, and ran over <HI>Bakers</HI> head and followed the rest, and then <HI>Baker</HI> came to ours; and gave an account of the Bever hid at <HI>Pejeps∣cot</HI> plain: and coming to the place where the plunder was, the Major sent a Scout to <HI>Pejepscot</HI> Fort, to see if they could make any discovery of the Ene∣mies Tracks or could discover any coming up the River; who return'd and said they saw nothing but our old Tracks at said Fort <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now having got some Plunder One of the Captains said it was time to go home, and se∣veral others were of the same mind; and the Major being much disturb'd at the Motion of theirs, expecting the Enemy would come in a very short time where they might have a great advantage of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Notwithstand∣ing all he could say or do, he was oblig'd to call a Council, according to his
<PB N="74" REF="001800_0077_0FB82D493B730A38"/>Instructions, wherein he was out-voted. The said Commander seeing he was put by of his intentions profer'd if 60 Men would stay with him he would not imbark as yet; but all that he could say or do could not prevail; then they Mov'd to the Vessels and Imbark'd and as they were going in the Vessels on the back side of <HI>Mayr-point</HI> they discovered 8 or 9 Canoo's, who turn'd short about, and went up the River; being the same <HI>Indians</HI> that the Major expected, and would have waited for; and the aforesaid Captain be∣ing much disturb'd at what the Major had said to him, drew off from the Fleet, and in the Night run aground; in the Morning <HI>Anthony Brakit</HI> ha∣ving been advis'd and directed by the <HI>Indian</HI> that made his escape from our Forces, came down near where the aforesaid Vessel lay a-ground, and got aboard; who has proved a good Pilot and Captain for his Country. The next day it being very calm and misty, so that they were all day getting down from <HI>Maquait</HI> to <HI>Perpodack;</HI> and the Masters of the Vessels thinking it not safe putting out in the Night, so late in the Year, Anchor'd there at <HI>Perpodack;</HI> the Vessels being much crouded, the Major ordered three Com∣panies should go on shore, and no more, himself with Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> went with them to order their lodging, and finding just Housing convenient for them, <HI>viz.</HI> Two Barns and one House; so seeing them all settled and their Watches out, the Major and Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> return'd to go aboard, and co∣ming near where the Boat was, it was pretty dark, they discovered some Men, but did not know what or who they were; the Major ordered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e that were with him all to clap down and cock their Guns, and he call'd and ask'd them, Who they were? and they said, <HI>Indians:</HI> he ask'd them, Whose Men they were? they said Capt. <HI>Southworth's:</HI> he ask'd them where they in∣tended to lodge? They said in those little Hutts that the Enemy had made when they took that Garrison. The Major told them they must not make any fires, for if they did the Enemy would be upon them before day. They laugh'd, and said. Our Major was afraid. Having given them their directions, he with Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> went on board the <HI>Mary Sloop;</HI> designing to Write home, and send away in the Morning the two Sloops which had the Small Pox on board, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But before day our <HI>Indians</HI> began to make fires and to Sing and Dance; so the Major call'd to Capt. <HI>Southworth</HI> to go a-shore &amp; look after his Men, for the Enemy would be upon them by'nd by. He order'd the Boat to be hall'd up to carry him a-shore, and call'd Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> to go with him, and just as the day began to appear, as the Major was getting into the Boat to go a-shore, the Enemy fired upon our Men the <HI>Indians,</HI> notwithstanding that one <HI>Philip</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> of ours, who was out upon the Watch, heard a man cough, and the sticks crack; who gave the rest an account, that he saw <HI>Indians;</HI> which they would not believe; but said to him, You are afraid: his answer was, that they might see them come creep∣ping: They laugh'd and said, they were Hogs: Ay, (said he) and they
<PB N="75" REF="001800_0078_0FB82D4AA0E34BD8"/>will bite you by'nd by. So presently they did fire upon our Men; but the Morning being misty their Guns did not go off quick, so that our Men had all time to fall down before their Guns went off, and saved themselves from that Volley, except one man, who was kill'd. This sudden firing upon our <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers surprized them that they left their Arms, but soon recover'd them again, and got down the bank which was but low: The Major with all the Forces on board landed as fast as they could; the Enemy firing smartly at them; however all got safe a-shore. The Enemy had a great advantage of our Forces, who were between the Sun rising &amp; the Enemy, so that if a man put up his head or hand they could see it, and would fire at it: However some with the Major got up the bank behind stumps and rocks, to have the advantage of firing at the Enemy; but when the Sun was risen the Major slip'd down the bank again where all the Forces were order'd to observe his Motion, <HI>viz.</HI> That he would give three shouts and then all of them should run with him up the bank: so when he had given the third shout, ran up the bank, and Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> with him, but when the said <HI>Con∣verse</HI> perceived that the Forces did not follow as commanded, call'd to the Major and told him the Forces did not follow; who notwithstanding the Enemy fired smartly at, yet got safe down the bank again, and Rallying the Forces up the bank, soon put the Enemy to flight; and following them so close, that they took 13 Canoo's, and one Lusty Man, who had <HI>Joseph Ramsdle's</HI> Scalp by his side, who was taken by two of our <HI>Indians,</HI> and having his deserts was himself Scalp'd. This being a short and smart fight, some of our Men were kill'd, and several wounded. Some time after an <HI>English</HI> Man who was Prisoner amongst them, gave an account that our Forces had kill'd and wounded several of the Enemy, for they kill'd several Prisoners accor∣ding to their Custom <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After this action was over our Force: imbark'd for <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and the Major went to <HI>Wells,</HI> and remov'd the Captain there, and put in Capt. <HI>Andras,</HI> who had been with him and knew the Discourse left with the two old Squaws at <HI>Ameras-cogen,</HI> for <HI>Hakins</HI> &amp; <HI>Worumbo</HI> to come there in 14 days, if they had a mind to hear of their Wives &amp; Children: Who did then or soon after come with a Flag of Truce to said <HI>Wells</HI> Garri∣son, and had leave to come in, and more appearing came in, to the number of Eight, (without any terms) being all Chief Sachems; and was very glad to hear of the Women and Children, <HI>viz. Hakins</HI> and <HI>Worumbo's</HI> Wives and Children; who all said three several times that they would never fight a∣gainst the <HI>English</HI> any more, for the <HI>French</HI> made fools of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They saying as they did, the said <HI>Andras</HI> let them go. Maj <HI>Church</HI> being come to <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and two of his transports having the Small Pox on board; and several of his Men having got great Colds by their hard Service, pretended they were going to have the Small Pox, thinking by that means to be sent home speedily; the Major being willing to try them, went to the Gentlemen
<PB N="76" REF="001800_0079_0FB82D4C43F1B078"/>there and desired them to provide an House, for some of his Men expected they should have the Small Pox; who read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly did, and told him, That the People belonging to it was just recover'd of the Small Pox, and had been all at Meeting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Major returning to his Officers order'd them to draw out all their men that were going to have the Small Pox for he had provi∣ded an Hospital for them: So they drew out 17 Men, that had as they said, all the symptoms of the Small Pox; he ordered them all to follow him, and coming to the House, he ask'd them, How they liked it? they said very well. Then he told them that the People in said House have all had the Small Pox, and was recovered; and that if they went in they must not come out till they all had it: Whereupon they all presently began to grow bet∣ter, and to make excuses except one Man who desired to stay out till Night before he went in, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Major going to the Gentlemen, told them, That one thing more would work a perfect cure upon his Men, which was to let them go home: Which did work a cure upon all, except one, and he had not the Small Pox. So he ordered the Plunder should be divided forth∣with, and sent away all the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Forces. But the Gentlemen there de∣sired him to stay and they would be assisting to him in raising new Forces to the number of what was sent away; and that they would send to <HI>Boston</HI> for Provisions: which they did, and sent Capt <HI>Plaisted</HI> to the Governour and Council at <HI>Boston, &amp;c.</HI> And in the mean time the Major with those Gen∣tlemen went into all those Parts and raised a sufficient number of Men, both Officers &amp; Souldiers; who all met at the bank on the same day that Capt. <HI>Plaisted</HI> return'd from <HI>Boston;</HI> whose return from <HI>Boston</HI> Gentlemen was, That the <HI>Canada</HI> Expedition had dreen'd them so that they could do no more: So that Maj. <HI>Church</HI> notwithstanding he had been at considerable Expences in raising said Forces to Serve his King and Country was oblig'd to give them a Treat and dismiss them: Taking his leave of them came home to <HI>Boston</HI> in the <HI>Mary Sloop</HI> Mr. <HI>Alden</HI> Master, and Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> with him, of a Saturday; and waiting upon the Governour, and some of the Gentlemen in <HI>Boston,</HI> they look'd very strange upon them, which not only troubled them but put them into some consternation what the matter should be, that after so much toyl &amp; hard Service could not have so much as one pleasant word, nor no Money in their Pockets; for Maj <HI>Church</HI> had but <HI>Eight Pence</HI> left, and Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> none, as he said afterwards. Maj. <HI>Church</HI> seeing two Gentle∣men which he knew had Money, ask'd them to lend him <HI>Forty Shillings,</HI> tel∣ling them his necessity: Yet they resused. So being bare of Money was oblig'd to lodge at Mr. <HI>Aldens</HI> three Nights; and the next Tuesday Morn∣ing Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> came to him (not knowing each others circumstances as yet) and said he would walk with him out of Town; so coming near <HI>Pil∣lards</HI> at the South End, they had some Discourse; that it was very hard that they should part with dry lips: Maj <HI>Church</HI> told Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> that he had
<PB N="77" REF="001800_0080_0FB82D5131933150"/>but <HI>Eight Peace</HI> left, and could not borrow any Money to carry him home. And the said <HI>Converse</HI> said, that he had not a <HI>Peny</HI> left; so they were ob∣lig'd to part without going in to <HI>Pollards, &amp;c.</HI> The said Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> re∣turned back into Town, and the said <HI>Church</HI> went over to <HI>Roxbury;</HI> and at the Tavern he met with <HI>Stephen Braton</HI> of <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> a Drover; who was glad to see him the said <HI>Church,</HI> and he as glad to see his Neighbour: where∣upon Maj. <HI>Church</HI> call'd for an <HI>Eight-Peny</HI> Tankard of drink and let the said <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raton</HI> know his cireumstances, ask'd him whether he would lend him <HI>Forty Shillings?</HI> He answered, Yes: <HI>Forty Pounds,</HI> if he wanted it. So he thank'd him, and said, he world have but <HI>Forty Shillings;</HI> which he freely lent him: and prosently after Major <HI>Church</HI> was told that his Brother <HI>Caleb Church</HI> of <HI>Watertown</HI> was coming with a spare I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orse for him, having heard the Night before that his Brother was come in; by which means the said Maj <HI>Church</HI> got home. And for all his travel &amp; expences in raising Souldiers, and Ser∣vice done, never had but 14 <HI>l</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Gentlemen, &amp;c not a <HI>Peny</HI> of <HI>Boston:</HI> notwithstanding he had wore out all his Clothes, and run himself in debt, so that he was oblig'd to Sell half a-share of Land in <HI>Tiverton</HI> for about 60 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which is now worth 300 <HI>l.</HI> more and above than what he had.</P>
<P>Having not been at home long before he found out the reason why <HI>Boston</HI> Gentlemen look'd so disaffected on him; as you may see by the sequel of two Letters Maj. <HI>Church</HI> sent to the Gentlemen in the Eastward parts: which are as followeth.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bristol,</HI> <DATE>Novemb. 27. 1690.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Worthy Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to my promise when with you last, I waited upon the Go∣vernent at <HI>Boston</HI> upon the Saturday, Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> being with me. The Governour informed us that the Council was to meet on the Monday following in the afternoon, at which time we both there waited upon them, and gave them an account of the State of your Country, and great ne∣cessities. They informed us, that their General Court was to Convene on the Wednesday following; at which time they would debate &amp; consi∣der of the matter; my self being bound home, Capt. <HI>Converse</HI> was ordered to wait upon them, and bring you their resolves. I then took notice of the Council that they look'd upon me with an ill aspect, not judging me worthy to receive thanks for the Service I had done in your parts; nor as much as ask me whether I wanted Money to bare my Expence, or a Horse to carry me home. But I was forc'd for want of Money (being far from friends) to go to <HI>Roxbury</HI> on foot; but meeting there with a <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Gentleman, acquainted him of my wants, who tendered me <HI>en Pounds,</HI> whereby I was accommodated for my Journey home: And being come home, I went to the Minister of our Town, and gave him an account of the transactions of the great affairs I had been imploy'd in, and of the great
<PB N="78" REF="001800_0081_0FB82D55A5054F68"/>favour God was pleased to shew me, and my Company, and the benefit I hoped would accrue to your selves; and desired him to Return Publick Thanks: but at the same interim of time a Paper was presented unto him from a Court of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> which was holded before I came home, to Command a day of Humiliation thro' the whole Government, because of the frowns of God upon those Forces sent under my Command, and the ill success we had, for want of good conduct. All which was caused by those false Reports which were posted home by those ill affected Officers that were under my Conduct; especially one which your selves very well know, who had the advantage of being at home a Week before me, being sick of Action, and wanting the advantage to be at the Bank, which he every day was mindful of more than fighting the Enemy in their own Country. After I came home, being inform'd of a General Court at <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> and not forgetting my faithful Promise to you, and the duty I lay under, I went thither, where waiting upon them, I gave them an account of my Eastward transactions, and made them sensible of the falseness of those reports that were posted to them by ill hands, and found some small favourable acceptance with them, so far that I was credited. I presented your Thanks to them for their seasonable sending those Forces to relieve you, with that expence and charge they had been at; which Thanks they gratefully received; and said a few Lines from your selves would have been well accepted. I then gave them an account of your great necessities by being imprisoned in your Garrisons, and the great mischief that would attend the Publick concerns of this Country by the loss of their Majesty's Interest, and so much good Estate of yours &amp; your Neighbours; as doubt∣less would be on the deserting of your Town. I then moved for a free Contribution for your relief, which they with great forwardness promo∣ted; and then ordered a day of Thanksgiving thro' the Government up∣on the 26th. day of this Instant. Upon which day a Collection was or∣dered for your relief (and the Places near Adjacent) in every respective Town in this Government; and for the good management of it that it might be safely convey'd unto your hands, they appointed a Man in each County for the reception &amp; conveyance thereof. The persons nominated and accepted thereof, are: For the County of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> Capt. <HI>Nathanael Thomas</HI> of <HI>Marshfield:</HI> For the County of <HI>Barnstable,</HI> Capt. <HI>Joseph Lathrop</HI> of <HI>Barnstable:</HI> And for the County of <HI>Bristol,</HI> my self. Which when gather∣ed you will have a particular account from each person, with orders of advice how it may be disposed of for your best advantage, with a Copy of the Courts order. The Gentlemen the effects are to be sent to are your selves that I now Write to, <HI>viz. John Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elwright</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Capt. <HI>John Littlefield,</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Joseph Story</HI> I defer'd writing expecting every day to hear from you concerning the <HI>Indians</HI> coming to treat about their Prisoners that we
<PB N="79" REF="001800_0082_0FB82D56A2579C58"/>had taken. The discourse I made with them at <HI>Ameras-cogen,</HI> I know would have that Effect as to bring them to a treaty, which I should have thought my self happy to have been improved in, knowing that it would have made much for your good. But no intelligence coming to me from any Gentlemen in your parts, and hearing nothing but by accident, and that in the latter end of the week by some of ours coming from <HI>Boston,</HI> in∣formed me that the <HI>Indians</HI> were come in to your Town to seek for Peace; and that there was to be a treaty speedily; but the time they know not. I took my Horse, and upon the Monday set out for <HI>Boston,</HI> expecting the treaty had been at your Town, as rationally it should, but on Tuesday Night coming to <HI>Boston,</HI> there met with Capt. <HI>Elisha Andros,</HI> who informed me that the Place of treaty was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acaty-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck,</HI> and that Capt <HI>Alden</HI> was gone from <HI>Boston</HI> four days before I came there, and had carryed all the <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners with him, and that all the Forces were drawn away out of your parts, except 12 men in your Town, and 12 in <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scataqua,</HI> which news did so amuse me, to see that wisdom was so taken from the wise, and such im∣prudence in their actions, as to be deluded by <HI>Indians;</HI> and to have a treaty so far from any <HI>English</HI> Town, and to draw off the Forces upon what pre∣tence soever, to me looks very ill. My fear is that they will deliver those we have taken, which if kept would have been greatly for your Security, it keeping them in awe, and preventing them from doing any hostile acti∣on or mischief, I knowing that the <HI>English</HI> being a broad are very earnest to go home, and the <HI>Indians</HI> are very tedious in their discourses, and by that will have an advantage to have their Captives at a very low rate to your great damage. <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as to <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> I have not concern'd my self as to any relief for you, having nothing in writing to show to them, yet upon discourse with some Gentlemen there, they have signified a great forwardness to promote such a thing. I lying under great reflections from some of yours in the Eastward parts, that I was a very Covotous Person, and came there to enrich my self, and that I kill'd their Cattel and Bar∣rel'd them up and sent them to <HI>Boston,</HI> and Sold them for Plunder, and made Money to put into my own Pocket; and the owners of them being poor People beg'd for the Hides and Tallow, with tears in their eyes; and that I was so cruel as to deny them; which makes me judge my self uncapa∣ble to Serve you in that matter: yet I do assure you that the People are ve∣ry charitable at the <HI>Island,</HI> and forward in such good actions, and therefore advise you to desire some good substantial Person to take the management of it, and write to the Government there, which I know will not be labour loft. As for what I am accused of, you all can witness to the contrary, and I should take it very kindly from you to do me that just right, as to vindicate my Reputation; for the wise man says, <HI>A good Name is as precious Oyntment.</HI> When I hear of the effect of the Treaty, and have an account
<PB N="80" REF="001800_0083_0FB82D5827EC5258"/>of this Contribution, I intend again to Write to you, being very desirous, &amp;c should think my self very happy, to be favoured with a few lines from your selves, or any Gentlemen in the Eastward parts.

<P>Then the Major and his Forces embark'd and made the best of their way to <HI>Penobscot;</HI> and coming to an Island in those Parts in the evening, landed his Forces at one end of the said Island: Then the Major took part of his Forces and mov'd toward Day to the other end of the said Island, where they found two <HI>French Men,</HI> and their Families in their houses; and that one or both of them had <HI>Indian</HI> Women to their Wives, and had Children by them. The Major presently examining the <HI>French men,</HI> Where the <HI>Indians</HI> were? They told him, That there was a great company of them upon an Island just by: and showing him the Island, presently discover'd several of them. Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces still keeping undiscover'd to them, ask'd the <HI>French men</HI> where their passing Place was? Which they readily shew'd him; so presently placed an Ambascade to take any that should come over. Then sent orders for all the rest of the Forces to come; sending them an account what he had seen &amp; met withal; strickly charging them to keep themselves undiscovered by the Enemy. The Ambascade did not lye long before an <HI>Indian</HI> Man and a Woman came over in a Canoo to the Place for landing, where the Ambascade was laid: who haul'd up their Canoo, and came right into the hands of our Ambascade, who so suddenly surprized them that they could not give any notice to the others from whence they came; the Major ordering that none of his should offer to meddle with the Canoo, lest they should be discovered, hoping to take the most of them if his Forces came as order'd, he expecting them to come as directed. But the first news he had of them was, That they were all coming, tho' not privately
<PB N="85" REF="001800_0088_0FB82D672830D950"/>as ordered; but in the Vessels fair in sight of the Enemy, which soon put them all to flight: and our Forces not having Boats suitable to pursue them, they got all away in their Canoo's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (which caused Maj <HI>Church</HI> to say, He would never go out again without sufficient number of Whale-boats) which for want of, was the ruine of that action. Then Maj. <HI>Church</HI> ac∣cording to his Instructions rang'd all those parts to find all their Corn, and carried aboard their Vessels what he thought convenient, and destroy'd the rest. Also finding considerable quantities of Plunder, <HI>viz</HI> Bever &amp; Moose skins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Having done what Service they could in those parts, he retur∣ned back to his Excellency at <HI>Pemequid;</HI> where being come, staid not long: they being short of Bread, his Excellency intended home for <HI>Boston,</HI> for more Provisions; but before, going with Maj. <HI>Church</HI> &amp; his Forces to <HI>Kenebeck</HI> Ri∣ver, and coming there, gave him his further Orders; which are as followeth.</P>

<P>Then his Excellency taking leave went for <HI>Boston;</HI> and soon after Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces had a smart fight with the Enemy in <HI>Kenebeck</HI>-River, Pursued them so hard that they left their Canoo's &amp; ran up into the woods, still pursued them up to their Fort at <HI>Taconock,</HI> which the Enemy perceiving set fire to their Houses in the Fort, and ran away by the light of them, and when Maj. <HI>Church</HI> came to the said Fort found about half their Houses stand∣ing and the rest burnt; also found great quantities of Corn, put up into Indian Cribs, which he and his Forces destroyed, as ordered. Having done what Service he could in those parts return'd to <HI>Pemequid,</HI> and coming there imploy'd his Forces according to his Instructions: being out of Bread, his Excellency not coming, Maj. <HI>Church</HI> was oblig'd to borrow Bread of the Captain of the Man of War that was then there for all the Forces under his Command, his Excellency not coming as expected. But at length his Ex∣cellency came and brought very little Bread more than would pay what was borrowed of the Man of War: So that in a short time after Maj. <HI>Church</HI> with his Forces return'd home to <HI>Boston,</HI> and had their Wages for their good Service done. Only one thing by the way I will but just mention, that is, about the Six Pounds Maj. <HI>Church</HI> borrowed as afore-mention'd, and put in∣to
<PB N="86" REF="001800_0089_0FB82D68A04379C8"/>the hands of Mr. <HI>Fobes,</HI> who distributed the said Money, all but 30 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to the <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers as directed, which was deducted our of their Wages, and the Country had Credit for the same; and the said <HI>Fobes</HI> kept the 30 <ABBR><HI>s</HI></ABBR> to himself, which was deducted out of his Wages. Whereupon Maj <HI>Walley</HI> and the said <HI>Fobes</HI> had some words. In short, Maj. <HI>Church</HI> was forc'd to pay the Six Pounds he borrowed out of his own Pocket, besides which the said <HI>Church</HI> was oblig'd to expend about Six Pounds of his own Money in Marching down the Forces both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Boston,</HI> having no drink allow'd them upon the Road, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that in stead of Maj <HI>Church's</HI> having the al∣lowances afore-mentioned by Maj. <HI>Walley,</HI> he was out of Pocket about Twelve Pounds more and above what he had; all which had not been, had not his Excellency been gone out of the Country.</P>

<P>In the time Maj. <HI>Church</HI> lay at <HI>Boston,</HI> the News came of <HI>Pemequid</HI> Fort being taken, it came by a Shallop that brought son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prisoners to <HI>Boston,</HI> who gave account also that there was a French Ship at Mount-<HI>Desart,</HI> who had taken a Ship of ours; so the discourse was that they would send the Man of War, with other Forces to take the said French Ship and retake ours. But in the mean time Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces being ready, imbark'd, and on the 15th day of <HI>August</HI> set Sail for <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> where more Men were to joyn them (but before they lest <HI>Boston,</HI> Maj <HI>Church</HI> discours'd with the Captain of the Man of War, who promised him, if he went to Mount-<HI>Desart</HI> in pur∣suit of the said French Ship, that he would call for him and his Forces at <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> expecting that the <HI>French &amp; Indians</HI> might not be far from the said French Ship, so that he might have an opportunity to fight them while he was ingag'd with the French Ship:) Soon after the Forces arrived at <HI>Pis∣cataqua</HI> the Major sent his <HI>Indian</HI> Souldiers to Col. <HI>Gidney</HI> at <HI>York,</HI> to be as∣sisting for the defence of those Places; who gave them a good Commend for their ready &amp; willing Services done, in Scouting, and the like Lying at <HI>Piscataqua</HI> with the reft of our Forces near a Week, waiting for more For∣ces who was to joyn them to make up their complement; in all which time heard never a word of the Man of War. On the 22d of <HI>August</HI> they all imbark'd from <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and when they came against <HI>York,</HI> the Major went a-shore, sending Capt. <HI>Gorham</HI> with some Forces in the two Briganteens and a Sloop to <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> ordering him to send out Scouts to see if they could make any discovery of the Enemy, and to wait there till he came to them: Maj <HI>Church</HI> coming to <HI>York,</HI> Col. <HI>Gidney</HI> told him his opinion was, That the Enemy was drawn off from those parts, for that the Scouts could not discover any of them, nor their Tracks. So having done his business there, went with what Forces he had there to <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> where he had the same account from Capt. <HI>Gorham,</HI> That they had not discovered any of the Enemy, nor any new Tracks: So concluding they were gone from those Parts towards <HI>Penobscot;</HI> the Major ordered all the Vessels to come to Sail and make the beft of their way to <HI>Monbegin,</HI> which being not far from <HI>Penobscot,</HI> where the main body of our Enemies living was; being in great hopes to come up with the Army of <HI>French &amp; Indians,</HI> before they had scattered and were gone past <HI>Penobscot</HI> or Mount-<HI>Desart,</HI> which is the chief place of their
<PB N="89" REF="001800_0092_0FB82D7457DD0A10"/>departure from each other after such actions; and having a fair wind made the beft of our way, and early next Morning they got into <HI>Monbegin,</HI> and there lay all day fitting their Boats, and other neccssaries to imbark in the Night at <HI>Mussel neck</HI> with their Boats; lying there all Day to keep undisco∣vered from the Enemy; at Night the Major ordered the Vessels all to come to Sail and carry the Forces over the Bay near <HI>Penobscot;</HI> but having little Wind, he ordered all the Souldiers to imbark on board the Boats with eight days Provision and sent the Vessels back to <HI>Monbegin,</HI> that they might not be discovered by the Enemy; giving them orders when and where they should come to him. The Forces being all ready in their Boats, rowing very hard, got a-shore at a Point near <HI>Penobscot</HI> just as the day broke, and hid their Boats, and keeping a good look out by Sea, and sent Scouts out by Land; but could not discover neither Canoo's nor <HI>Indians;</HI> what Tracks and fire places they saw were judg'd to be 7 or 8 days before they came: As soon as Night came that they might go undiscovered got into their Boats and went by <HI>Mussel-neck,</HI> and so amongst <HI>Penobscot</HI> Islands, looking very sharp as they went for fires on the shore, and for Canoo's, but found neither; getting up to <HI>Mathebestucks</HI> hills, day coming on, landed, and hid their Boats; locking out for the Enemy, as the day before, but to little purpose. Night coming on to their Oars again, working very hard, turn'd the Night into Day; made several of their new Souldiers grumble: but telling them they hoped to come up quickly with the Enemy put new life into them; and by day-light they got into the Mouth of the River, where landing, found many Randezvous and fire Places where the <HI>Indians</HI> had been; but at the same space of time, as before mentioned. And no Canoo's passed up the River that day. Their Pilot <HI>Joseph York</HI> inform'd the Major that 50 or 60 Miles up that River at the great Falls, the Enemy had a great Randezvous, and planted a great quantity of Corn, when he was a Prisoner with them, four Years a goe, and that he was very well acquainted there; this gave great incouragement to have had some considerable advantage of the Ene∣my at that Place; so using their utmost endeavours to get up there undis∣covered: and coming there found no Enemy nor Corn Planted, they ha∣ving deserted the Place. And ranging about the Falls on both sides of the River, leaving Men on the East side of the said River, and the Boats just below the Falls, with a good guard to secure them, and to take the Enemy if they came down the River in their Canoo's: The west side being the Place where the Enemy lived and beft to travel on, they resolved to range as pri∣vately as they could, a Mile or two above the Falls, discovered a birch Ca∣noo coming down with two <HI>Indians</HI> in it, the Major sent word immediately back to those at the Falls to lye very close, and let them pass down the Falls, and to take them alive, that he might have Intelligence where the Enemy was (which would have been a great advantage to them:) But a foolish
<PB N="90" REF="001800_0093_0FB82D7726745088"/>Souldier seeing them passing by him, shot at them, contrary to orders given, which prevented them going into the Ambascado that was laid for them; whereupon several more of our Men being near, shot at them; so that one of them could not stand when he got a-shore, but crept away into the brush, the other step'd out of the Canoo with his Paddle in his hand, and ran about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rod, and then threw down his Paddle and turn'd back &amp; took up his Gun, and so escaped: One of our <HI>Indians</HI> swom over the River and setch'd the Canoo, wherein was a considerable quantity of bloud on the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, that the <HI>Indians</HI> sat on; the Canoo having several holes shot in her: They stopt the holes, and then Capt. <HI>Brackit</HI> with an <HI>Indian</HI> Souldier went over the River, who Track'd them by the bloud about half a Mile, found his Gun, took it up, and seeing the bloud no further, concluded that he stopt his bloud, and so got away. In the mean time another Canoo with three Men were co∣ming down the River were fired at by some of our Forces, ran a-shore and left two of their Guns in the Canoo, which were taken, and also a Letter from a Priest to <HI>Casteen,</HI> that gave him an account of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> re∣turning over the Lake to <HI>Mount-Royal,</HI> and of their little Service done upon the <HI>Maquas Indians</HI> westward, only demolishing one Fort and cutting down some Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He desiring to hear of the proceedings of <HI>Deborabuel,</HI> and the French Man of War; and informed him that there were several Ca∣noo's coming with work men from <HI>Quabeck,</HI> to Saint <HI>John's,</HI> where since we concluded it was to build a Fort at the Rivers Mouth, where the great Guns were taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It being just Night, the Officers were call'd together to advise, &amp; their Pilot <HI>York</HI> inform'd them of a Fort up that River, &amp; that it was built on a little Island in that River; and that there was no getting to it but in Canoo's, or on the Ice in the Winter time: This with the certain know∣ledge that we were discovered by the Enemy that escaped out of the upper Canoo, concluded it not proper at that time to proceed any further up, and that there was no getting any further with our Boats; and the Enemy be∣ing Alarm'd would certainly fly from them (and to do as they did four Years ago at their Fort at <HI>Taconock,</HI> having fought them in <HI>Kanebeck</HI> River, and pursued them about go Miles to <HI>Taconock;</HI> for they then set their Fort on fire, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un away by the Light of it, ours not being able to come up with them at that Place.) Maj <HI>Church</HI> then incouraging his Souldiers, told them, he hop'd they should meet with part of the Enemy, in <HI>Penobscot</HI> bay, or at Mount-<HI>Desart,</HI> where the French Ships were. So notwithstanding they had been rowing several Nights before, with much toyl, besides were short of Provisions, they chearfully embark'd on board their Boats, and went down the River, both with and against the Tide: and next Morning came to their Vessels, where the Major had ordered them to meet him, who could give him no intelligence of any Enemy. Where being come they refresh'd themselves; Meeting then with another disappointment for their Pilot <HI>York</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="001800_0094_0FB82D795F77FC08"/>not being acquainted any further, they began to lament the loss of one <HI>Robert Cawley,</HI> who they chiefly depended on for all the Service to be done now Eastward: he having been taken away from them the Night before they sat Sail from <HI>Boston</HI> (and was on board Mr. <HI>Thorps</HI> Sloop) and put on board the Man of War, unknown to Maj <HI>Church;</HI> notwithflanding he had been at the charge and trouble of procuring him. Then the Major was oblig'd to one <HI>Bord,</HI> procured by Mr. <HI>William Alden,</HI> who being acquainted in those parts, to leave his Vessel and go with him in the Boats, which he readily complyed with, and so went to <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ket</HI> point; where being inform'd was a likely place to meet with the Enemy; coming there found several Housing and small Fields of Corn, the fires having been out several days, and no new Tracks. But upon <HI>Penobscot</HI> Island they found several <HI>Indian</HI> Houses, Corn &amp;Turnips, tho' the Enemy still being all gone, as before mentioned. Then they di∣vided and sent their Boats some one way and some another, thinking that if any straggling <HI>Indians,</HI> or <HI>Casteen</HI> himself should be there about, they might find them, but it prov'd all in vain. Himself and several Boats went to Mount <HI>Desart,</HI> to see if the French Ships were gone and whither any of the Enemy might be there, but to no purpose: The Ships being gone and the Enemy also. They being now got several Leagues to the Westward of their Vessels; and seeing that the way was clear for their Vessels to pass: And all their extream rowing and travelling by Land and Water, Night and Day to be all in vain. The Enemy having left those parts, as they judg'd about eight or ten days before. And then returning to their Vessels, the Commander calling all his Officers together, to consult and resolve what to do, concluding that the Enemy by some means or other had received some Intelligence of their being come out against them; and that they were in no necessity to come down to the Sea side as yet, Moose and Bever now being fat. They then agreed to go so far East, and imploy themselves that the Enemy belonging to those parts might think they were gone home: ha∣ving some discourse about going over to Saint <HI>John's</HI>; but the Masters of the Vessels said, he had as good carry them to old <HI>France, &amp;c.</HI> which put off that design, they concluding that the French Ships were there. Then the Major mov'd for going over the Bay towards <HI>Lahane,</HI> and toward the Gut of <HI>Cancer,</HI> where was another considerable Fort of <HI>Indians,</HI> who often came to the as∣sistance of our Enemy, the barbarous <HI>Indians;</HI> saying that by the time they should return again, the Enemy belonging to these parts would be come down again, expecting that we are gone home. But in short could not prevail with the Masters of the open Sloops to venture a cross the Bay; who said it was very dangerous so late in the Year, and as much as their Lives were worth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then they concluded and resolved to go to <HI>Se∣nactaca,</HI> wherein there was a ready compliance (but the want of their Pilot <HI>Robert Cawley</HI> was a great damage to them, who knew all those parts:) how∣ever
<PB N="92" REF="001800_0095_0FB82D7C56111BE0"/>Mr. <HI>John Alden</HI> Master of the Briganteen Endeavour Pilotted them up the Bay to <HI>Senactaca;</HI> and coming to <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ston-</HI> point, being not far from <HI>Se∣nactaca;</HI> then came too with all the Vessels; and early next Morning came to Sail, and about Sun-rise got into Town; but it being so late before we landed, that the Enemy most of them made their escape, (and as it hap∣pen'd landed where the <HI>French &amp; Indians</HI> had some time before killed Lieut. <HI>John Paine,</HI> and several of Capt. <HI>Smithsons</HI> Men, that was with said <HI>Paine</HI>) They seeing our Forces coming took the opportunity, fired several Guns, and so run all into the Woods, carryed all or most part of their goods with them. One <HI>Jarman Bridgway</HI> came running to wards our Forces with a Gun in one hand, and his Cartridg-box in the other, calling to our Forces to stop that he might speak with them; but Maj. <HI>Church</HI> thinking it was that they might have some advantage, ordered them to run on; when the said <HI>Bridg∣way</HI> saw they would not stop, turn'd and run, but the Major call'd unto him, and bid him stop, or he should be shot down; some of our Forces being near to the said <HI>Bridgway,</HI> said it was the General that call'd to him: he hearing that, stop'd and turn'd about, laying down his Gun, stood, till the Major came up to him, his desire was that the Commander would make haste with him to his house, lest the Salvages should kill his Father and Mother, who were upward of fourscore Years of Age, and could not go. The Ma∣jor ask'd the said <HI>Bridgway</HI> whither there was any <HI>Indians</HI> amongst them? and where they liv'd? he shak'd his head, and said, he durst not tell, for if he did they would take an opportunity and kill him and his: so all that could be got out of him was, that they were run into the Woods with the rest. Then orders were given to pursue the Enemy, and to kill what <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> they could find, and take the <HI>French</HI> alive, and give them quarter, if they ask'd it. Our Forces soon took three French Men, who upon examination said, That the Indians were all run into the woods. The French firing se∣veral Guns at our Forces, and ours at them; but they being better acquain∣ted with the woods than ours, got away. The Major took the above said <HI>Jarman Bridgway</HI> for a Pilot, and with some of his Forces went over a Ri∣ver, to several of their houses, but the People were gone and carryed their goods with them: In ranging the woods found several Indian-houses their fires being just out but no Indians. Spending that day in ranging to &amp; fro, found considerable of their goods, and but few People; at Night the Major writ a Letter, and sent out two French Prisoners, wherein was signifyed, That if they would come in, they should have good quarters. The next day several come in which did belong to that part of the Town where our Forces first landed, who had encouragements given them by our Commander, That if they would assist him in taking those <HI>Indians</HI> which belong'd to those parts, they should have their goods return'd to them again and their Estates should not be damnify'd; which they refused. Then the Major and his
<PB N="93" REF="001800_0096_0FB82D7DAAE14B80"/>Forces pursued their design and went further ranging their Country, found several more houses, but the People fled, and carried what they had away; but in a Crick found a prize Bark that was brought in there by a French Privateer: in ranging the words took some Prisoners, who upon examina∣tion gave our Commander an account that there was some <HI>Indian:</HI> upon a Neck of Land towards <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes;</HI> so a party of Men was sent into those woods, and in their ranging about the said Neck found some Plunder, and a consi∣derable quantity of <HI>Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>buries,</HI> both green and dry, which were gathered by the <HI>Indians,</HI> and had like to have taken two <HI>Indians,</HI> who by the help of a birch Canoo got over the River and made their escape. Also they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und two Barrels of Powder, and near half a bushel of Bullets; the French de∣nving it to be theirs, said they were the Salvage; but sure it might be a supply for our Enemies: Also they tock from <HI>Jarman Bridgway</HI> several Bar∣rels of Powder, with Bullets, Shot, Spears and Knives, and other supplies to relieve our Enemies; he owning that he had been a Trading with those <HI>Indians</HI> along <HI>Cape Sable</HI> Shore, with <HI>Peter Assnow,</HI> &amp;c. in a Sloop our Forces took from him; and that there he met with the French Ships and went a∣long with them to St. <HI>John's,</HI> and helped them to unload the said Ships and carryed up the River Provisions, Ammunition, and other goods to <HI>Vilboons</HI> Fort. The Major having ranged all Places as was thought proper return'd back to the place where they first Landed, and finding several Prisoners come in, who were much troubled to see their Cattel, Sheep, Hogs &amp; Dogs lying dead about their houses, chop'd and hack'd with Hatches, (which was done without order from the Major) however he told them, It was nothing to what our poor <HI>English</HI> in our Frontier Towns were forc'd to look upon, for Men, Women and Children were chop'd and hack'd so, and left half dead, with all their Scalps taken of, and that they and their <HI>Indians</HI> served ours so; and our Salvages would be glad to serve them so too, if he would permit them; which caused them to be mighty submissive, and beg'd the Major that he would not let the Salvages serve them so. Our <HI>Indians</HI> being some what sensible of the discourse, desired to have some of them to Rost, and so make a dance; and dancing in a hideous manner to terrify them, said, That they could eat any fort of flesh, and that some of theirs would make their hearts strong: stepping up to some of the Prisoners, said, They must have their Scalps, which much terrifyed the poor Prisoners, who beg'd for their lives. The Major told them he did not design the Salvages should hurt them; but it was to let them see a little what the poor <HI>English</HI> felt, saying, it was not their Scalps he wanted, but the Salvages, for that he should get nothing by them; and told them, That their Fathers the Fryers and Governours incouraged their Salvages, and gave them Money to Scalp our <HI>English,</HI> notwithstanding they were with them; which several of our <HI>English</HI> there present did testify to their Faces, that their Fathers and Mothers were
<PB N="94" REF="001800_0097_0FB82D7F30718CE0"/>served so in their sight. But the Major bid them tell their Fathers the Fryers and the Governours, That if they still persisted and let their wretched Sal∣vages kill &amp; destroy the poor <HI>English</HI> at that rate, he would come with some hundreds of Salvages, and let them loose among them, who would Kill, Scalp and carry away every French person in all those parts for they were the root from whence all the branches came that hurt us; for the <HI>Indians</HI> could not do us any harm, if they did not relieve and supply them. The <HI>French</HI> being sensible of the Majors kindness to them, kiss'd his hand, &amp; was very thankful to him for his favour to them in saving their lives; owned that their Priests was at the taking of <HI>Pemaquid</HI> Fort, and were now gone to <HI>Layben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> with some of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to meet the French Ships, but for what they would not tell. The Commander with his Forces having done all the Ser∣vice they could in those parts, concluded to go to St. <HI>John's</HI> River to do further Service for their King and Country, Embark'd all on board their Transports, and having a fair wind soon got to <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>genest,</HI> which lyes a little distance from the Mouth of St. <HI>John's</HI> River. Next Morning early the Ma∣jor with his Forces landed to see what discovery they could make, Travel'd a cross the woods, to the old Fort or Falls at the Mouth of St. <HI>John's</HI> River, keeping themselves undiscovered from the Enemy; finding that there were several Men at work, and having inform'd themselves as much as they could, (the Enemy being on the other side of the River, could not come at them) Returned back, but Night coming on and dark wet Weather, with bad Tra∣velling, was oblig'd to stop in the woods till towards day next Morning, and then went on board; soon after the Major ordered all the Vessels to come, to Sail, and go into the Mouth of the River; being done, it was not long before the Major and his Ferces landed on the East side of the River, the <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring briskly at them, but did them no harm; and running siercely upon the Enemy, they soon fled into the Woods. The Major ordered a brisk party to run a cross a Neck to cut them off from their Canoo's, which the day before they had made a discovery of; so the Commander with the rest ran directly towards the New Fore they were a building, not knowing but they had sotre Ordnance mounted. The Enemy running directly to their Canoo's was m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by our Forces, who fired at them and kill'd one and wounded Corpotal <HI>Canton,</HI> who was taken, the rest threw down what they had and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an into the woods; the said Prisoner <HI>Canton</HI> being brought to the Major, told Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, if he would let his Surgeon dress his wound and cure him, he would he Serviceable to him as long as he liv'd: so being dress'd, he was Examin'd: who gave the Major an account of the Twelve great Guns which were hid in the beach below high water Mark (the Carriges, Shot and Wheelbarrows some Flower &amp; Fork, all hid in the Woods:) And the next Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the Officers being all ondered to meet together, to consult a∣bout going up the River to <HI>Vilb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens</HI> Fort, and none amongst them being ac∣quainted
<PB N="95" REF="001800_0098_0FB82D83426DE320"/>but the <HI>Aldens,</HI> who said the Water in the River was very low, so that they could not get up to the Fort, and the Prisoner <HI>Canton</HI> told the Com∣mander, That what the <HI>Aldens</HI> said was true. So not being willing to make a <HI>Canada</HI> Expedition, concluded it was not practicable to proceed. Then ordered some of the Forces to get the great Guns on board the open Sloops, and the rest to rang the woods for the Enemy, who took one Prisoner, and brought in; who in their ranging found there a Shallop haul'd into a Crick, and a day or two after there came in a Young Souldier to our Forces, who upon examination gave an account of two more which he left in the woods at some distance; so immediately the Major with some of his Forces went in pursuit of them, taking the said Prisoner with them, who convey'd them to the place where he lest them, but they were gone. Then ask'd the Pri∣sane, Whither there were any <HI>Indians</HI> in those parts?

Now having with a great deal of pains and trouble got all the Guns, Shot and other Stotes aboard, intended on our design which we came out first for, but the Wind not serving, the Commander sent out his Scouts into the woods to seek for the Enemy, and four of our <HI>Indians</HI> come upon three <HI>French</HI> Men undiscovered, who concluded that if the <HI>French</HI> should discover them would fire at them and might kill one or more of them, which to prevent fired at the <HI>French</HI> kill'd one and took the other two Prisoners; and it happen'd that he who was kill'd was <HI>Shanel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI> the Chief Man there <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The same Day they mended their Whale-boats, and the Shallop which they took, fitting her to Row with Eight Oars, that she might be helpful to their Prosecuting their intended design against the Enemy in their returning homewards. Then the Commander ordering all the Officers to come together, Inform'd them of his intentions and ordered that no Vessels should depart from the Fleet, but to attend the Motions of their Commadore, as formerly, except they were parted by Storms or thick Fogs, and if so it should happen that any did part, when they come to <HI>Passamequady,</HI> should stop there a while, for there they intended to stop, and do business with the help of their Boats a∣gainst the Enemy, and if they mist that to stop at <HI>Machias;</HI> which was the next place he intended to stop at, having an account by the Prisoners taken, That Mr. <HI>Lateril</HI> was there a trading with the <HI>Indians</HI> in that River: Incouraging them, said, He did not doubt but to have a good booty there; and if they should pass those two places, be sure not to go past <HI>Naskege</HI>-point, but to stop there, till he came and not to depart thence in a Fortnight with∣out his orders, having great Service to do in and about <HI>Penobsecot, &amp;c.</HI> Then the Major discoursed with Capt, <HI>Brackit,</HI> Capt. <HI>Hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>well</HI> and Capt. <HI>Larking,</HI>

The projection being such, That when they came to <HI>Penobsent</HI> the Commander Besign'd to take what Provisions could be spared out of all the Sloops, and put on board the two Briganteens, and to send all the Sloops home with some of the Officers and Men that wanted to be at home: and then with those Forces afore-mentioned (<HI>to wit</HI>) the Eastward Men, and all the <HI>In∣dians;</HI> and to take what Provisions and Ammunition was needful, and to March with himself up into the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Country, in search for the Enemy, and if possible to take that Fort in <HI>Penobscot</HI> River.

<P>The Major having read his last Orders, and considering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Commission, found that he was oblig'd to attend, <HI>All Orders,</HI> &amp;c. was much concern'd that he and his were prevented in their intended projection, if carryed back to St. <HI>John's.</HI> Then discoursing with Col. <HI>Hathorne,</HI> gave him an account of what they had done at St. <HI>John's, viz.</HI> That as to the demolishing the New Fort they had done it, and got all their great Guns and Stores aboard their Vessels; and that if it had not been that the waters were so low would have taken the Fort up the River also before he came away. Told him also that one of the Prisoners which he had taken at St. <HI>John's,</HI> upon examination concerning the <HI>Indians</HI> in those parts, told him, it was as hard for <HI>Vilboon</HI> their Governour to get one of their <HI>Indians</HI> down to the water side, as to carry one of those great Guns upon his back: and that they had an account of him and his Forces coming to those parts by a Prisoner out of <HI>Boston</HI> Goal. Also
<PB N="98" REF="001800_0101_0FB82C2084007D88"/>told his Honour, That if they went back it would wholly disappoint them of their doing any further Service, which was that they came for to <HI>Penobs∣cot,</HI> and Places Adjacent; but all was to no purpose, his Honour telling the Major that he must attend his Orders then received. And to incourage the Officers and Souldiers, told them, They should be wholly at the Majors Ordering &amp; Command in the whole action: (and to be short did go back) and the event may be seen in Col. <HI>Hathron's</HI> Journal of the said action. Only I must observe one thing by the way, which was, That when they drew off to come down the River again, Col. <HI>Hathorne</HI> came off and left the Major behind to see that all the Forces were drawn off; and coming down the River in or near the Rear, in the Night heard a person hollow, not knowing at first but that it might be a snare to draw them into; but upon considera∣tion sent to see who or what he was, found him to be a Negro man belong∣ing to <HI>Marblehead,</HI> that had been taken, and kept a Prisoner amongst them for some time. The Major ask'd him. Whither he could give any account of the <HI>Indians</HI> in those parts? He said, Yes, they were or had been all drawn off from the Sea Coast up into the Woods near a hundred Miles having had an account by a Prisoner out of <HI>Boston</HI> Goal; that Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and his For∣ces were coming out against them in four Brigantee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, &amp; four Sloops, with 24 Peraougers, meaning Whale-boats, which put them into a fright, that notwithstanding they were so far up in the Woods were afraid to make fires by Day left he and his Forces should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscover the Smokes and in the Night left they should see the light. One thing more I would just give a hint of, that is, How the <HI>French</HI> in the Eastward parts were much surpriz'd at the motion of the Whale boats; said, There was no abiding for them in that Country: and I have been inform'd since, that soon after this Expedition, they drew off from St. <HI>John's</HI> Fort &amp; River But to return, Then going all down the River, Embark'd and went homeward; only by the way <HI>Candid Reader,</HI> I would let you know of two things that proved very prejudicial to Major <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces: The first was, That the Government should miss <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much as to send any Prisoner away from <HI>Boston</HI> before the Expedition was over. Secondly, That they should send Col. <HI>Hathrone</HI> to take them from the Service &amp; business they went to do: Who with submission, doubt∣less thought they did for the best, tho' it prov'd to the contrary. So shall wind up with just a hint of what happen'd at their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng home to <HI>Boston.</HI> After all their hard Service both Night &amp; Day, the Government took away all the great Guns, and Warlike Stores, and gave them not a Peny for them, (except it was some Powder, and that they gave what they pleas'd for it) and beside the Assembly past a Vote that they should have but half pay. But his Honour the Lieut. Governour being much disturb'd at their so do∣ing went in to the Town-House where the Representatives were sitting, and told them except they did Re-assume that Vote, which was to cut Maj. <HI>Church</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="001800_0102_0FB82C27871B65A0"/>and his Forces off half their pay, they should sit there till the next Spring. Whereupon it was Re-assumed: So that they had just their bare Wages. But as yet never had any Allowance for the great G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns and Stores; nei∣ther has Maj <HI>Church</HI> had any Allowance for all his Travel and great Ex∣pences in Raising the said Forces Volunteer.</P>

<P>IN the Year 1703, 4.

All which with some o∣ther horrible Instances done by those Barbarous Salvages, which Maj. <HI>Church</HI> himself was an eye witness to in his former Travels in the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ward parts, did much astonish him. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e a Woman that those Barbarous Salvages had taken and kill'd, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed in a most bruitish manner (as can be express'd) with a Young Child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d tast with strings to her breast; which insant had no apparent wound, which doubtless was left alive to suck its dead Mothers Breast, and so miserably to perish &amp; dye. Also to see other poor Children hanging upon Fences dead of eithers Sex, in their own poor Rags, not worth their strip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng them of, in scorn and derision. Another Instance was, of a straggling Souldier, who was found at <HI>Casco,</HI> expos'd in a shameful and bar∣barous manner; his body being staked up, his head cut off, and a hogs head set in the room, his body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip'd up, and his heart and inwards taken out, and private Members cut off and hung with belts of their own, the inwards at one side of his body, and his private at the other, in scorn &amp; derision of the <HI>English</HI> Souldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These and such like Barbarities caused Major <HI>Church</HI> to express himself to this purpose, That if he were Commander in Chief of these Provinces, he would soon put an end to those barbarities done by the Barbarous Enemy, by making it his whole business to sight and de∣stroy those Salvages, as they did our poor Neighbours; which doubtless might have been done if rightly managed, and that in a short time <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that these with the late Inhumanities done upon the Inhabitants of <HI>Deerfield,</HI> made such an Impression on his heart as cannot well be expressed; so that this Bloud boyl'd within him, making such Impulses on his Mind, that he forgot all former treatments, which were enough to hinder any Man espe∣cially the said Maj. <HI>Church</HI> from doing any further Service.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Tiverton, <DATE>February 5. 1703, 4</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>May it please your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>ACcording to your request when I was lass with your Self; and in obedience there-unto, I present you with these following lines, that concern the preparation for next Springs Expedition, to Attack the Enemy. According to my former Direction, for it is good to have a full stroke at them first, before they have opportunity to Run for it; for the first of our action will be our opportunity to destroy them, and to prevent their running away, in way-laying every passage; and make them know we are in good earnest, and so we being in a diligent use of means, we may hope for a blessing from the Almighty, and that He will be pleased to put a dread in their hearts, that they may fall before us and perish: For my advice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. <HI>That Ten or Twelve hundred good able Souldiers well equip'd be in a readiness fit for action by the first of</HI> April <HI>at the furthest, for then will be time to be upon action.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2ly. <HI>That five &amp; forty or fifty good Whale-boats be had ready, well fitted, with five good O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, and</HI> 12 <HI>or</HI> 15 <HI>good Paddles to every Boat: And upon the Wail of each Boat five pieces of strong Leather be fastened on each side to slip five small Ash bars thro', that so when ever they land the Men may step over-board, &amp; slip in said bars a-cross, and take up said Boat, that she may not be hurt against the Rocks. And that two sui∣table Brass-Kittles be provided to belong to each Boat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o dress the Mens Victuals i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to make their Lives comfortable.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3ly. <HI>That</HI> 4 <HI>or</HI> 500 <HI>pair of good Indian Shoes be made ready, fit for the Service, for the</HI> English <HI>&amp;</HI> Indians, <HI>that must improve the Whale-boats, and Birch Caneo's, for they will be very proper, and safe for that Service; and let there be a good Store of Cow Hides, well Tann'd, for a supply of such Shoes; and Hemp to make Thread, and Wax, to mend &amp; make more of such Shoes, when wanted, and a good store of Awls.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4ly. <HI>That there be a</HI> 100 <HI>large Hatches or light Axes made pretty broad, &amp; steel∣ed with the best Steal that can be got, and made by workmen, that may cut very well, and bold, that the Hemlock knots may not brake nor turn them; to widden the land∣ing places up the Falls, for it may happen that we may get up with some of our Whale-boats to their Falls or Head-quarters.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5ly. <HI>That there be a suitable quantity of small Bags, or Wollets provided, that every Man that wants may have one, to put up his Bullets in, of such a size as will sit his Gun, (and not served as at</HI> Casco.) <HI>That every Mans Bag be so Marked that he may not change it: for if so, it will make a great confusion in action; that every Man store of Ball be weighed to him, that so be may be account able, &amp; may not squan∣der it away; and also his store of Powder, that so be may try his Powder &amp; Gun be∣fore
<PB N="101" REF="001800_0104_0FB82C29EAA271A8"/>action. And that every particular Company may have a Barrel of Powder to themselves, and so marked that it by no means may be changed; that men may know before hand, and may not be cheated out of their Lives, by having bad Powder; Or not knowing how to use it: and this will prove a great advantage to the action.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6ly. <HI>That C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> John Gorham <HI>if he may be prevailed with may be concerned in the management of the Whale-boats, he having been formerly concerned in the</HI> Eastern Parts, <HI>and experienced in that affair. And Whale-men them will be very serviceable in this Expedition, which having a promise made to them, that they shall be released in good season to go home a Whaling in the Fall; your Excellency will have men enough.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7ly. <HI>That there may be raised for this Service</HI> 300 Indians <HI>at least, &amp; more if they may be had; for I know certainly of my own knowledge, that they exceed most of our</HI> English <HI>in hunting &amp; sculking in the woods, being always us'd to it; and it must be practised if ever we intend to destroy those</HI> Indian <HI>Enemies.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8ly. <HI>That the Souldiers already out</HI> Eastward <HI>in the Service; By men of known judgment may take a survey of them and their Arms; and see if their Arms be good, and that they know how to use them, in shootting right at a Mark; and that they be men of good Reason &amp; Sence, to know how to manage themselves in so difficult a pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of Service, as this</HI> Indian <HI>hunting i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for bad men are but a clogg and hindrance to as Army, being a trouble and vex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion to good Commanders, and so many Mouths to devour the Countries Provision, and a hindrance to all good action.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>9ly. <HI>That special care be had in taking up the whale-boats, that they be good and sit for that Service; that so the Country be not cheated, as formerly, in having rotten∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oats; and as much care that the Owners may have good satisfaction for them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>10ly. <HI>That the Tenders or Transports, Vessels to be improved in this action be good Deck'd Vessels, not too big, because of going up several Rivers; having</HI> 4 <HI>or</HI> 6 <HI>small Guns a-piece for defence, and the fewer Men will defend them. And there is enough such Vessels to be had.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>11ly. To conclude all, <HI>If your Excellency will be pleased to make your Self Great and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a happy People, as to the destroying of our Enemies, and easing of our Taxes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>be pleased to draw forth all those Forces now in Pay in all the Eastward Parts, both at</HI> Saco <HI>&amp;</HI> Casco-Bay; <HI>for those two Trading-Houses never did any good, nor never will, and are not worthy the name of</HI> Queens <HI>Forts; and the first wilding of them, had no other Effect, but to lay us under Tribute to that wreached Pagan Crew; and I hope will never be wanted, for that they were first built for: But sure it is, they are very serviceable to them, for they get many a good advantage of us to destroy our Men, and laugh at us for our folly, that we should be at so much post &amp; trouble to do a thing that does us so much harm, and no manner of good: but to the contrary, when they see all our Forces drawn forth, and in the pursuit of them, They will think that we begin to be rouzed up and to be awake, and will not be satis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with what they have pleas'd to leave us, but are resolved to Retake from them, that they formerly took from us, and drive them out of their Country also. The which being done, then to build a Fort at suitable time and in a convenient place; and it
<PB N="102" REF="001800_0105_0FB82C2BCB609CE8"/>will be very honourable to your Excellency &amp; of great Service to Her Majesty &amp; to the enlargement of her Majesty's Government: (The Place ment being at</HI> Port Royal.)</ITEM>
<ITEM>12ly. <HI>That the objection made against drawing off the Forces in the</HI> Eastward <HI>Parts will be no damage to the Inhabitants; for former Experience teacheth us, that so soon as drawn into their Country they will presently forsake ours to take care of their own: And that there be no failure in making preparation of these things afore-men∣tioned, for many times the want of small things, prevent the compleating of great Actions; and that every thing be in a readiness before the Forces be raised, to prevent Charges; and the Enemy having Intelligence: And that the General Court be moved to make suitable Acts, for the incouragirg both</HI> English <HI>&amp;</HI> Indians; <HI>that so men of business may freely offer Estates and Concerns to Serve the Publick.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This hoping what I have taken the pains to Write in the sincerity of my heart and good affection, will be well accepted;</P>
<CLOSER>I make bold to subscribe, as I am <SIGNED>your Excellency's most Devoted and Humble Servant,

<P>Then returning to his Excellency presented the said Scheme, which his Excellency approv'd of; and return'd it again to Maj. <HI>Church</HI> and desired him to see that every thing was provided, telling him that he should have an Order from the Commissary General to proceed. Then returned home and made it his whole business to provide Oars and Paddles and a Vessel to carry them round; and then return'd again to his Excellency, who gave him a Commission: which is as followeth.</P>

Col. <HI>Church</HI> no sooner received his Commission, but proceeded to the rai∣sing of Men Volunteers, by going into every Town within the three Coun∣ties which was formerly <HI>Plymouth</HI> Government; advising with the Chief Officer of each Company, to call his Company together, that so he might have the better opportunity to discourse &amp; incourage them to Serve their Queen and Country; treating them with Drink convenient; told them he did not doubt but with God's blessing to bring them all home again; all which, with many other arguments animated their hearts to do Service, so that Col. <HI>Church</HI> enlisted out of some Companies near 20 Men, &amp; others 15. He having raised a sufficient number of <HI>English</HI> Souldiers, proceeded to the enlisting of <HI>Indians</HI> in all those parts where they dwelt, which was a great fategue &amp; expence; being a People that need much treating, especially with Drink <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Having enlisted the most of his Souldiers in those parts, who daily lay upon him; was not less than 5 <HI>l. per</HI> day expences, some days, in Victuals &amp; Drink; who doubtless thought (especially the <HI>English</HI>) that the Country would have re-imburst it again, otherways they would hardly accepted it of him. Col. <HI>Church's</HI> Souldiers both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in those parts being raised, March'd them all down to <HI>Nantasket,</HI> according to his Ex∣cellency's directions; where being came, the following Gentlemen were Commissionated to be Commanders of each particular Company, <HI>viz.</HI> Lieut.

His Excellency (looking upon Col <HI>Church</HI>) re∣plyed, He could not admit of that, by reason he had by the advice of Her Majesty's Council writ to Her Majesty about the taking of <HI>Port Royal</HI> Fort, and how it should be disposed of when taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> However Col. <HI>Church</HI> proceeding to get every thing ready for the Forces down at <HI>Nantasket,</HI> which was the place of Parade. He happening one day to be at Capt. <HI>Belchers,</HI> where his Excellency happened to come; who was pleased to order Col. <HI>Church</HI> to put on his Sword, and walk with him up the Common; which he readily complyed with: where being come, he saw two Mortar pieces with Shells, and an Ingineer trying with them, to throw a Shell from them to any
<PB N="104" REF="001800_0107_0FB82C2F22538578"/>spot of ground where he said it should fall: Which when Col. <HI>Church</HI> had seen done, gave him great incouragement &amp; hopes that it would promote their going to <HI>Port Royal,</HI> which he had solicited for; and returning from thence after they had seen them try'd by the said Ingineer, and performing what was proposed. Coming near to Capt. <HI>William Clarks</HI>-house over a∣gainst the Horse-shoe, his Excellency was invited by Capt. <HI>Clark</HI> to walk over and take a Glass of Wine; which he was pleased to accept of, and took Col. <HI>Church</HI> with him; and in the time they were taking a Glass of Wine, Col. <HI>Church</HI> once more presumed to say to his Excellency; Sir, I hope that now we shall go to <HI>Port Royal</HI> in order to take it; those Mortars being very suitable for such an Enterprize. His Excellency was pleas'd to reply; Col. <HI>Church</HI> you must say no more of that matter, for the Letter I told you of I writ by the advice of her Majesty's Council, now lyes at home on the board before the Lords Commissioners of her Majesty's foraign Plantations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After some days every thing being ready to Embark, Col. <HI>Church</HI> received his Instructions: which are as followeth.</P>

<P>Pursuant to his Instructions he sent away his Transports, and Forces to <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> but was oblig'd himself to wait upon his Excellency by Land to <HI>Piscataqua</HI> in order to raise more Forces, in the way thither; and did raise a Company under the Command of Capt. <HI>Harridon;</HI> taking care also to provide a Pilot for them in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Funde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Col. <HI>Church</HI> being directed to one—<HI>Fellows,</HI> whom he met with at <HI>Ipswich.</HI> And going from thence to <HI>Piscataqua</HI> with his Excellency, was there met by that worthy Gentleman Maj. <HI>Winthrop Hilton,</HI> who was very helpful to him in the whole Expedition, whose Name &amp; Memory ought not to be forgot. Being ready to Embark from <HI>Piscataqua;</HI> Col. <HI>Church</HI> requested the Commanders of her Majesty's Ships, Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> &amp; Capt. <HI>Regers</HI> to tarry at <HI>Piscataqua</HI> a Fortnight. that so they might not be discovered by the Enemy before he had done some spoil upon them. Then moving in their Transports, as directed, Got safe into <HI>Montinucus</HI> undiscovered by the Enemy. Next Morning early sitted out two Whale boats with men, Capt. <HI>John Cook</HI> in one, and Capt. <HI>Constant Church</HI> in the other; and sent them to Green-Island upon a discovery; and coming there they parted, one went to one part, and the other to the other part, that so they might not miss of what could be discovered; where they met with old <HI>Lafaure</HI> with his two Sons <HI>Thomas</HI> &amp; <HI>Timothy,</HI> and a <HI>Canada Indian.</HI> The Enemy seeing that they were discovered, threw down their Ducks and Eggs who had got a considerable quantity of each, and ran to their Canoo's, getting into them, stood directly for the Maine; looking behind them, per∣ceived the whale boats to gain so fast upon them, clapt side by side and aM four got into one Canoo, which prov'd of little advantage to them, for the Whale boats gained so much upon them, and got so near that Capt. <HI>Cock</HI> firing at the Srores-man which was the <HI>Indian,</HI> &amp; happen'd to graze his skull, and quite spoil'd his Paddling: upon which old <HI>Lafaure</HI> and Sons seeing their companions condition soon beg'd for quarter, and had it granted: the two Captains with their success presently return'd to their Commander, ta∣king care that their Captives should not discourse together before they were examined; when brought to Col. <HI>Church,</HI> he order'd them to be apart; and first proceeded to examine old <HI>Lafaure,</HI> who he found to be very surly &amp; cross, so that he could gain no manner of intelligence by him; upon which the Commander was resolved to put in practice what he had formerly done at <HI>Seg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</HI> ordering his <HI>Indians</HI> to make two large heaps of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y wood at some distance one from the other, and to set a large stake in the ground close to
<PB N="107" REF="001800_0110_0FB82C395C39C8C8"/>each heap; then ordered the two Sons <HI>Thomas</HI> &amp; <HI>Timothy</HI> to be brought and bound to the Stakes; also ordering his <HI>Indians</HI> to paint themselves with co∣lours which they had brought for that use. Then he Colonel proceeded to examine first <HI>Timothy;</HI> and told him, He had examin'd his Father already; and that if he told him the truth he would save his Life, and take him into his Service; and that he should have good pay &amp; live well. He answer'd, That he would tell him the truth; and gave him an account of every thing he knew; which was all Minuted down: He being ask'd whither his Bro∣ther <HI>Thomas</HI> did not know more than he? His answer was, Yes. For his Brother <HI>Thomas</HI> had a Commission sent him from the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> to Command a Company of <HI>Indians</HI> who were gathered together at a Place where some French Gentlemen lately arrived from <HI>Canada,</HI> who were Officers to Command the rest that were to go Westward to fight the <HI>English,</HI> and that there was sent to his Father and Brother <HI>Tom,</HI> a considerable quantity of Flower, Fruit, Ammunition and Stores, for the supply of the said Army. He being ask'd, Whither he could Pilot our Forces to them? said, No: But his Brother <HI>Tom</HI> could, for he had hid it and that he was not then with him. The Colonel ask'd him, What Gentlemen those were that came from <HI>Canada?</HI> He answered Monsieur <HI>Gordan,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sharkee.</HI> Being ask'd where they were? Answered at <HI>Passam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quado;</HI> building a Fort there. Being also ask'd, What number of <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> there were at <HI>Penobscot?</HI> He answered, there were several Families, but they liv'd scattering. Ask'd him further, If he would Pilot our Forces thither? Answered, He would if the Com∣mander would not let the Salvages Roft him. Upon which the Colonel ordered him to be loosed from the Stake, and took him by the hand, told him, He would be as kind to him as his own Father; at which he seemed to be very thankful. And then the Colonel proceeded to examine his Bro∣ther <HI>Tom,</HI> and told him that he had examined his Father and Brother, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Brother had told him every tittle he knew; and that he knew more than b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brother <HI>Timothy</HI> did; and that if he would be Ingenious &amp; confess all he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iew, he should fare as well as his Brother, but if not, the Salvages should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ost him. Whereupon he solemnly promised that he would; and that he would Pilot him to every thing he knew, to the value of a Knife and Shea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e (which without doubt he did.) Then the Colonel immediate∣ly gave orders for the Whale-boats to be ready, and went directly over where the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id Goods &amp; Stores were, and found them as inform'd, took them on board the Boats, and returned to their Transports; and ordering Pro∣visions to be put into every Mans Snapfack for 6 or 8 days; so in the dusk of the Evening lest their Transports, with Orders how they should act; and went directly for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Mainland of <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obscot</HI> and Mouth of that River with their Pilots <HI>Tom</HI> &amp; <HI>Timothy,</HI> who carried them directly to every Place &amp; Ha∣bitation both of <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians</HI> there abouts, with the assistance of one <HI>De
<PB N="108" REF="001800_0111_0FB82C3C2B658710"/>Young,</HI> whom they carried out of <HI>Bostom</HI> Goal for the same purpose, who was very serviceable to them: being there we kill'd and toak every one both <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians,</HI> not knowing that any one did escape in all <HI>Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t;</HI> a∣mong those that were taken was St. <HI>Casteens</HI> Daughter, who said that her Husband was gone to <HI>France,</HI> to her Father Monsieur <HI>Casteen:</HI> She having her Children with her, the Commander was very kind to her and them. All the Prisoners that were then taken, held to one Story in general, which they had from <HI>Lafaure's</HI> Sons; that there were no more <HI>Indians</HI> there-abouts, but enough of them at <HI>Passamequado;</HI> upon which they soon return'd to their Transports with their Prisoners &amp; Plunder. The Commander giving order immediately for the Souldiers in the Whale-boats to have a recruit of Provisions for a further pursuit of the Enemy, giving orders to the Trans∣ports to slay a few days more there, and then go to Mount <HI>Desart</HI> (and there to stay for her Majesly's Ships, who were directed to come thither) and there to wait his further order. Then Col. <HI>Church</HI> with his Forces immedi∣ately imbark'd on board their Whale-boats, &amp; proceeded to scout the Coast and to try if they could discover any of the Enemy coming from <HI>Passame∣quado;</HI> making their stops in the day time (at all the Points &amp; Places where they were certain the Enemy would Land, or come by with their Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>) and at Night to their Paddles. Then coming near where the Vessels were ordered to come, having made no discovery of the Enemy, went directly to Mount <HI>Desart,</HI> where the Transports were just come; and taking some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o∣visions for his Souldiers, gave direction for the Ships &amp; Transports in 6 days to come directly to <HI>Passamequado,</HI> where they should find him &amp; his For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. Then immediately mov'd away in the Whale boats &amp; made diligent search along shore, as formerly, inspecting all Places where the Enemy was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y to lurk: Particularly at <HI>Machias;</HI> but found neither Fires nor Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.

<P>I Received Yours of this Instant <HI>Octab. 9th.</HI> with the two inclosed Infor∣mations, that concern my actions at <HI>Possamequado;</HI> which I will give a just and true account of as near as possible I can <HI>(viz)</HI> on the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> last 1704. In the evening we entred in at the Westward Harbour at said <HI>Passamequado;</HI> coming up said Harbour to an Island, where landing, we came to a French house, and took a French Woman, and Children, the Woman upon her Examination said, her Husband was abroad a Fishing. I ask'd her, whither there were any <HI>Indians</HI> thereabouts? She said, Yes. There were a great many, and several on that Island. I ask'd her, whither she could Pilot me to them? Said, No. They hid in the Woods. I ask'd her, when she saw them? Answered, Just now, or a little while since, I ask'd
<PB N="109" REF="001800_0112_0FB82C3D69722B20"/>her, whether she knew where they had laid their Canoo's? Answered, No. They carried their Canoo's into the woods with them. We then hastened away a-long shore, seizing what Prisoner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could, taking old <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riel</HI> and his Family. This intelligence caus'd me to leave Col, <HI>Gorham,</HI> and a con∣siderable part of my Men (and Boats) with him at that Island, partly to guard and secure those Prisoners, being sensible it would be a great trou∣ble to have them to secure and guard at our next landing, where I did really expect, and hope to have an opportunity, to sight our <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies; for all our French Prisoners, that we had taken at <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and a-long shore had informed us, That when we came to the Place, where these <HI>Ca∣nada</HI> Gentlemen lived, we should certainly meet with the Salvages to sight us, those being the only Men that set the <HI>Indians</HI> against us, or upon us, and were newly come from <HI>Canada,</HI> to manage the War against us (plea∣ding in this account and information their own Innocency) and partly in hopes that he the said Col. <HI>Gorham</HI> would have a good opportunity in the Morning to destroy some of those our Enemies, (we were informed by the said French Woman as above,) with the use of his Boats, as I had given di∣rection. Ordering also Maj. <HI>Hilton,</HI> to pass over to the next Island, that lay East of us (with a small Party of Men and Boats) to surprize &amp; destroy any of the Enemy, that in their Canoo's might go here or there, from any place, to make their flight from us, and as he had opportunity to take any <HI>French</HI> Prisoners. We then immediately moved up the River in the dark Night thro' great difficulty, by reason of the Eddys and Whirlpools, made with the fierceness of the current. And here it may be hinted that we had information that <HI>Lotriel</HI> had loft some of his Family passing over to the next Island, falling into one of these Eddys were drowned; which the two Pi∣lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> told to discourage me. But I said nothing of that nature shall do it, for I was resolved to venture up, and therefore forthwith Paddling our Boats, as privately as we could, and with as much expedition as we could make with our Paddles, and the help of a strong Tide, we came up to Mon∣sieur <HI>Gourdons,</HI> a little before day; where taking notice of the Shoar, and finding it somewhat open and clear, I ordered Capt. <HI>Mirick</HI> and Capt. <HI>Cole,</HI> (having English Companies) to tarry with several of the Boats to be ready, that if any of the Enemy should come down out of the brush into the Bay, (it being very broad in that place) with their Canoo's, they might take and destroy them. Ordering the remainder of the Army, being landed, (with my self and the other Officers) to March up into the Woods, with a wide Front, and to keep at a confiderable distance; for that if they should run in heaps, the Enemy would have the greater advantage: and further directing them that if possible, they should destroy the Enemy with their Hatches, and not fire a Gun. This order I alwayes gave at landing telling them the inconveniency of firing, in that it might be first dange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,
<PB N="110" REF="001800_0113_0FB82C3EEA5952E8"/>to themselves, they being many of them Young Souldiers, (as I had sometimes observed, that one or two Guns being sired, many others would sire, at they knew not what; as happened presently after) and it would alarm the Enemy, and give them the opportunity to make their escape; and it might alarm the whole Country, and also prevent all further action from taking effect Orders being thus passed, we moved directly towards the Woods, <HI>Le Faver's</HI> Son directing us to a little Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t or Wigwam, which we immediately surrounded with a few Men, the rest Marching directly up into the Woods, to see what Wigwams or Hutts they could discover; my self made a little flop Ordering the Pilot to tell them in the Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, that they were surrounded with an Army, and that if they would come forth, and surrender themselves, they should have good quarter, but if not, they should be all knock'd on the head and die: One of them shewed himself, I ask'd, Who he was? He said <HI>Gourdan;</HI> and begg'd for quarter: I told him he should have good quarter; adding further, That if there were any more in the house they should come out: Then came out two men; <HI>Gourdan</HI> said, They were his Sons, and asked quarter for them, which was also granted. Then came out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Woman, and a little Boy; she sell upon her knees, begg'd quarts for her self and Children, and that I would not suffer the <HI>Indians</HI> to kill them. I told them they should have good quarter and not be hurt. After which I ordered a small guard over them, and so mov'd presently up with the rest of my Company, after them that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re gone before, but looking on my right hand over a little run, I saw some thing look black, just by me, stopped, and heard a talking, stepped over, and saw a little Hurt or Wigwam with a crowd of People round a bout it, which was contrary to my former directions: Ask'd them what they were doing? They reply'd there was some of the Enemy in a house, and would not come out. I ask'd what House? They said a Bark house. I hastily bid them pull it down, and knock them on the head, never asking whether they were <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Indians;</HI> they being all Enemies alike to me. And pissing then to them, and seeing them in great disorder, so many of the Ar∣my in a crowd together, acting so contrary to my Command &amp; Direction, exposing themselves, and the whole Army to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter ruine, by then so dis∣orderly crowding thick together; had an Enemy come upon them in that interim, and fired a Volley amongst them, they could not have miss'd a shot; and wholly neglecting their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y, in not attending my orders, in searching diligently for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>g Enemies in their Wigwams, or by their sires where I had great hopes, and real expectation to meat with them. I most certainly know that I was in an exceeding great Passion, but not with those poor miserable Enemies; for I took no notice of half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dozen of the Enemy, when at the same time, I expected to be engaged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some hundreds of them, of whom we had a continued account who
<PB N="111" REF="001800_0114_0FB82C43E76192D0"/>were expected from <HI>Port Royal</HI> side. In this heat of action, every word that I then spoke, I cannot give an account of, and I presume it is impos∣sible. I stop'd but little here, but went directly up into the woods, hoping to be better imployed, with the rest of the Army, I listen'd to hear, and looked earnestly to see what might be the next action; but meeting with many of the Souldiers, They told me, they had discovered nothing; we fetching a small compass round, came down again. It being pretty dark, I took notice, I saw two men lay dead as I thought, at the end of the house, where the door was, and immediately the Guns went off, and they fired every man as I thought, and most towards that place where I left the guard with Monsieur <HI>Gourdan.</HI> I had much ado to stop their firing, and told them, I thought they were mad, and I believed they had not killed and wounded less than 40 or 50 of our own Men. And I asked them what they shot at? They answered at a French man that ran away: but to admiration no man was kill'd but he, &amp; one of our own men wounded in the Leg; and I turning about, a French man spoke to me, and I gave him quarter. Day-light coming on and no discovery made of the Enemy, I went to the place where I had left Monsieur <HI>Gourdan,</HI> to examine him, and his Sons, who agreed in their examinations; told me two of their men were abroad: It prov'd a damage; and further told me, That Mon∣sieur <HI>Sharkee</HI> lived several Leagues up at the head of the River, at the Falls; and all the <HI>Indians</HI> were fishing, and tending their Corn there; and that Monsieur <HI>Sharkee</HI> had sent down to him, to come up to him to advise about the <HI>Indian</HI> Army, that was to go Westward; but he had returned him answer, his business was urgent, and he could not come up: and that <HI>Sharkee,</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> would certainly be down that day, or the next at the furthest, to come to conclude of that matter. This was a short Nights action, and all sensible Men do well know, that actions done in the dark (being in the Night as aforesaid) under so many difficulties, as we then laboured under, as before related, was a very hard Task for one Man, mat∣ters being circumstanc'd as in this action; which would not admit of cal∣ling a Council; and at that time could not be confin'd there-unto; at which time I was transported above fear or any sort of dread; yet being sensible of the danger in my Armies crowding so thick together, and of the great duty incumbent on me to preserve them from all the danger I possi∣bly could, for further improvement, in the Destruction of our implacable Enemies; am ready to conclude, that I was very quick &amp; absolute in giving such Commands &amp; Orders, as I then apprehended most proper and advantagious. And had it not been for the Intelligence I had received from the <HI>French</HI> we took at <HI>Penobscot,</HI> as before hinted, and the false report the <HI>French</HI> Woman (first took) gave me, I had not been in such haste. I question not but those <HI>French</HI> men that were slain, had the same good quar∣ter
<PB N="112" REF="001800_0115_0FB82C44DF42DE60"/>of other Prisoners. But I ever look'd at it a good Providence of Al∣mighty God, that some few of our cruel &amp; bloody Enemies, were made sensible of their bloody Cruelties, perpetrated on my dear &amp; loving friends and Country men; and that the same measure (in part) meeted to them, as they had been guilty of in a barbarous manner at <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erfield,</HI> &amp; I hope justly, I hope God Almighty will accept hereof, altho' it may not be eligible to our <HI>French</HI> implacable Enemies, and such others as are not our friends. The fore-going Journal and this short annexment, I thought it my duty to exhibit, for the satisfaction of my Friends &amp; Country-men, whom I very faithfully &amp; willingly served in the late Expedition; and I hope will find acceptance with you. Excellency, the Honourable Council &amp; Represen∣tatives now Assembled, as being done from the zeal I had in the said Ser∣vice of Her Majesty, and her good Subjects here.</P>

<P>This Nights Service being over immediately Col. <HI>Church</HI> leaves a suffici∣ent guard with <HI>Gourdan,</HI> and the other Prisoners, mov'd in some Whale-boats with the rest; and as they were going spy'd a small thing upon the Water, at a great distance, which proved to be a birch Canoo, with two <HI>Indians</HI> in her; the Colonel presently ordered the lightest boat he had to make the best of her way and cut them off from the Shore: but the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving their design run their Canoo a shore &amp; fled. Col. <HI>Church</HI> fearing they would run directly to <HI>Sharkee</HI> made all the expedition imaginable; but it being ebb and the water low, was obliged to land &amp; make the best of their way thro' the woods, hoping to intercept the <HI>Indians,</HI> and get to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> house before them; which was two Miles from where our Forces landed. The Colo∣nel being Ancient &amp; Unwildy, desired Serjeant <HI>Edee</HI> to run with him, and coming to several Trees fallen, which he could not creep under or readily get over, would lay his breast against the Tree the said <HI>Edee</HI> turning him over, generally had Cat luck, falling on his feet, by which means kept in the Front: and coming near to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> house, discovered some <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians</HI> making a Wair in the River, and presently discovered the two <HI>Indians</HI> afore∣mentioned, who call'd to them at work in the River; told them ther was an Army of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> just by; who immediately left their work and ran, endeavouring to get to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> house; who hearing the noise, took his Lady &amp; Child, and ran into the woods. Our Men running briskly fired &amp; kill'd one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and took the rest Prisoners. Then going to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> house found a Woman and Child, to whom they gave good quar∣ter: and finding that Madam <HI>Sharkee</HI> had lest her Silk Clothes &amp; fine linen behind her, our Forces was desirous to have pursued and taken her: But Col <HI>Church</HI> fothid them, saying he would have her run and suffer, that she might be made sensible, what hard ships our poor People had suffered by them, &amp;c. Then proceeded to examine the Prisoners newly taken, who gave
<PB N="113" REF="001800_0116_0FB82C4694158678"/>him the same account he had before; of the <HI>Indians</HI> being up at the Falls, &amp;c. It being just Night prevented our Attacking of them that Night. But next Morning early they mov'd up to the Falls (which was about a Mile higher:) But doubtless the Enemy had some Intelligence by the two afore∣said <HI>Indians,</HI> before our Forces came, so that they all got on the other side of the River and left some of their goods by the Water-side, to decoy our Men, that so they might fire upon them; which indeed they effected: But thro' the good Providence of God never a Man of ours was kill'd; and but one slightly wounded. After a short dispute Col. <HI>Church</HI> ordered that every Man might take what they pleased of the Fish which lay bundled up, and to burn the rest, which was a great quantity. The Enemy seeing what our Forces were about; and that their stock of Fish' was destroyed, and the sea∣son being over for getting any more, set up a hedious Cry, and so ran all away into the woods; who being all on the other side of the River, ours could not follow them. Having done, our Forces March'd down to their Boats at <HI>Sharkee's,</HI> and took their Prisoners, Bever, and other Plunder which they had got, and put it into their Boats, and went down to <HI>Gourdams</HI> house, where they had left Lieut. Col. <HI>Gorbam</HI> &amp; Maj <HI>Hilton,</HI> with part of the Forces to guard the Prisoners; (and kept a good look-out for more of the Enemy) who upon the Colonels return, gave him an account that they had made no discovery of the Enemy since he left them, &amp;c. Just then Her Majefly's Ships and Transports arriving. The Commanders of Her Majesty's Ships told Gol. <HI>Church</HI> that they had orders to go directly for <HI>Port Royal Gut,</HI> and wait the coming of some Store-Ships, which were expected at <HI>Port Royal</HI> from <HI>France;</HI> and Col. <HI>Church</HI> advising with them, proposed that it was very expedient and serviceable to the Crown, that Capt. <HI>Southack</HI> in the Pro∣vince Galley should accompany them, which they did readily acquiesce with him in. Upon which the Colonel immediately embark'd his Forces on board the Transports, and himself on board Capt. <HI>Jarvis;</HI> ordering the Commissary of the Stores, the Minister, Surgeons &amp; Pilots all to embark on board the same Vessel with him; ordering all the Whale boats to be put on board the Transports, and then all to come to Sail. The Ships standing away for <HI>Port Royal Gut,</HI> and Col, <HI>Church</HI> with the Transports for <HI>Menis:</HI> In their way the Colonel inquired of the Pilot—<HI>Fellows,</HI> What depth of Water there was in the Crick near the Town of <HI>Menis?</HI> He answered him that there was Water enough near the Town to flote that Vessel they were in at low Water, So when coming near, Col. <HI>Church</HI> observed a Woody Island between them and the Town, that they run up on the back-side of the said Island, with all their Transports undiscovered to the Enemy, and came to Anchor. Then the Colonel and all his Forces embark'd in the Whale boats it being late in the day mov'd directly for the Town, and in the way ask'd for the Pilot, whom he expected was in one of the Boats but he had given him the slap and tarried behind. The Colonel not know∣ing
<PB N="114" REF="001800_0117_0FB82C4A41114120"/>the difficulties as might attend their going up to the Town; immedi∣ately sent Lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>Giles,</HI> who could speak <HI>French,</HI> with a Flag of Truce up to the Town with a Summons, which was writ before they landed, expecting their surrender; which is as followeth.</P>

<P>Then moving to the Crick expecting to have had Water enough for the Boats, as the Pilot had inform'd them, but found not Water enough for a Canoo; so were oblig'd to land, intending to have been up at the Town Before the hour was out, that the Summons expressed: (For their return was, That if our Forces would not hurt their Estates, that then they would Surrender, if otherwise intended, they should fight for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) But meeting with several Cricks near 20 or 30 foot deep, which were very Muddy and Dirty, so that the Army could not get over them; was oblig'd to return to
<PB N="115" REF="001800_0118_0FB82C4F20016F88"/>their Boats again, and wait till within Night before the Tide served for them to go up to the Town; and then intended to go up pretty near the Town, and not to fall on till Morning, being in hopes that the banks of the Cricks would sheker them from the Enemy: but the Tides rising so high exposed them all to the Enemy; who had the Trees &amp; Woods to be-friend them. And so came down in the Night &amp; fired smartly at our Forces; but Col. <HI>Church</HI> being in a Pinis that had a small Cannon plac'd in the head, order∣ed it to be charg'd several times, with Bullets in small bags, and fired at the Enemy, which made such a rattling amongst the Trees, that caused the E∣nemy to draw off; and by the great Providence of Almighty God not one of our Forces was hurt that Night; (but as I have been informed they had one <HI>Indian</HI> kill'd, and some others wounded, which was some discourage∣ment to the Enemy.) Next Morning by break of Day, Col. <HI>Church</HI> or∣dered all his Forces, (and plac'd Maj. <HI>Hilton</HI> on the right wing,) to run all up driving the Enemy before them, who leaving their Town to our Forces, but had carried away the best of their Goods (which were soon found by our Souldiers.) The bulk of the Enemy happening to lye against our right Wing caused the hottest dispute there, who lay behind Logs and Trees, till our Forces, and Maj. <HI>Hilton</HI> who led them, came on upon them, and forc'd them to run; and notwithstanding the sharp firing of the Enemy at our Forces, by the repeated Providence of God there was never a Man of ours kill'd or wounded. Our Souldiers not having been long in Town before they found considerable quantities of Strong Drink (both Brandy &amp; Claret) and being very greedy after it, especially the <HI>Indians,</HI> were very disorderly, firing at every Pig, Turky or Fowl they saw, of which were very plenty in the Town; which indanger'd our own Men: Col. <HI>Church</HI> perceiving the disorder, and firing of his own Men, ran to put a stop to it, had several shot come very near him; and finding what had occasion'd this disorder, commanded his Officers to knock out the heads of every Cask of Strong Liquor they could find in the Town, to prevent any further disturbance a∣mongst his Army; knowing it was impossible to have kept it from them, especially the <HI>Indians,</HI> if it was saved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then some of the Army who were desirous to pursue the Enemy, having heard them driving away their Cattel, Requested the Colonel to let them go; who did: and gave them their orders. Capt. <HI>Cooke,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> to lead the two Wings, and Lieut. <HI>Barker</HI> who led the Colonels Company in the Center: and the said Capt. <HI>Cooke</HI> and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> desired Lieut. <HI>Barker</HI> not to move too fast; so that he might have the benefit of their assistance, if he had occasion; but the said Lieutenant not being so careful as he should have been, or at least was too eager, was shot down, and another Man; which were all the Men that were kill'd in the whole Expedition. Towards Night Col. <HI>Church</HI> ordered some of his Forces to pull down some of the Houses, and others to get Logs
<PB N="116" REF="001800_0119_0FB82C50EA9B2678"/>and make a Fortification for his whole Army to lodge in that Night, that so they might be together: and just before Night ordered some of his Men to go see if there were any Men in any of the Houses in the Town; if not, to set them all a fire: which was done, and the whole Town seemed to be of a fire all at once, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The next Morning the Colonel gave orders to his Men to dig down their Dams, and let the Tide in to destroy all their Corn, and every thing that was good, according to his Instructions; and to burn the Fortification which they had built the Day before: And when the Tide serv'd to put all their Plunder which they had got into the Boats. Then ordering his Souldiers to March at a good distance one from another; which caus'd the Enemy to think that there was not less than a thousand Men (as they said afterwards:) and that their burning of the Fortification, and doing as they did, caused the Enemy to think that they were gone clear off and not to return again. But it proved to the contrary, for Col. <HI>Church</HI> and his Forces only went aboard their Transports, and there staid till the Tide serv'd; in the Night embarked on board their Whale-boats, landed some of his Men, expecting they might meet with some of the Enemy mending their Dams; which they did, and with the Boats went up another branch of the River, to another Town or Village; upon such a surprize took as many Prisoners as they could desire. And it happened that Col. <HI>Church</HI> was at the French Captains House when two Gentlemen that came Post from the Governour of <HI>Port Royal</HI> to him, who was the Chief Com∣mander at <HI>Menis,</HI> with in Express to send away two Companies of Men to Defend the Kings Fort there; and to give him an account, That there was three <HI>English</HI> Men of War come into <HI>Port Royal Gut</HI> or Harbour; and that the Men sent for must be Posted away with all speed. Col. <HI>Church,</HI> as was said before, being there, treated the two Gentlemen very hansomely, and told them, He would send them back again Post to their Master upon his business; and bid them give him his hearty thanks for sending him such good News, that part of his Fleet was in so good a Harbour. Then reading the Summons to them that he had sent to <HI>Menis.</HI> Further added, That their Master the Governour of <HI>Port Royal</HI> must immediately send away a Post to the Governour of <HI>Canada</HI> at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> to prevent his further sending any of his cruel &amp; bloudy <HI>French</HI> and Salvages, as he had done lately upon <HI>Deerfield,</HI> where they had committed such horrible and bloudy outrages upon those poor People, that never did them any harm, as is intollerable to think of; and that for the future, if any such Hostilities were made upon our Fron∣tier Towns, or any of them, He would come out with a thousand Salvages, and Whale boats convenient, and turn his back upon them, and let his Sal∣vages Scalp &amp; Rost the <HI>French;</HI> or at least treat them as their Salvages had treated ours: Also gave them an account of part of that action at <HI>Passa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ado,</HI> and how that his Souldiers had Kill'd &amp; Scalp'd some <HI>Canada</HI> Men
<PB N="117" REF="001800_0120_0FB82C527087B0D8"/>there, and would be glad to Serve them so too, if he would permit them. Which terrifyed them very much, &amp;c. The two French Gentlemen that came Post made solemn Promises that they would punctually do the Colo∣nel's Message to their Governour. So with the desire of the French People there that the Governour might have this Intelligence, Col. <HI>Church</HI> dismiss'd them, and sent them away; telling the same Story to several of the Priso∣ners, and what they must expect if some speedy course was not taken up prevent further outrages upon the <HI>English.</HI> The number of Prisoners then Present (which were considerable) did unanimously intreat of Col. <HI>Church,</HI> that he would take them under the Protection of the Crown of <HI>England;</HI> making great Promises of their fidelity to the same, begging with great A∣gony of Spirit to Save their Lives, and to protect them from his Salvages, whom they extreamly dreaded: As to the matter of the Salvages, He told them, It would be just Retaliation for him to permit his Salvages to treat the <HI>French</HI> in the same manner, as the <HI>French</HI> with their Salvages treated our friends in our Frontier Towns: But as to his taking them under the Protecti∣on of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> he utterly refused it, urging to them their for∣mer Perfidiousness; they also urging to him, that it would be impossible for any <HI>French</HI> to live any where in the Bay of <HI>Fundy,</HI> if they were not taken under the <HI>English</HI> Government; for with the benefit of those Whale-boats, (as the <HI>English</HI> called them) they could take and destroy all their People in the Town of <HI>Menis</HI> in one Night: But he reply'd to them, It should never be; alledging to them that when they were so before, when <HI>Port Royal</HI> was taken last by the <HI>English</HI> that it prov'd of very ill consequence to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; the Subjects thereof in our Frontiers; for that our <HI>English</HI> Traders supplying them; enabled them (which opportunity they improv'd) to sup∣ply the <HI>Indians</HI> our bloudy Enemies; and therefore he could make no other Terms of Peace with them than that; if they the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Menis, Signect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> would keep at home with their bloudy Salvages, and not commit any Hostilities upon any of our Frontiers, we would return home &amp; leave them; for that we lived a great distance off, and had not come near them to hurt them now had not the blood of our poor Friends and Brethren in all the Frontiers of our Province cryed for Vengeance; especially that late un∣heard of Barbarity committed upon the Town of <HI>Deerfield;</HI> which wrought so generally on the hearts of our People, that our Forces came out with that Unanimity of Spirit, both among the <HI>English</HI> and our Salvages, that we had not, nor needed a Press'd Man among them. The Colonel also telling them, That if ever hereafter any of our Frontiers East or West were Mo∣lested by them, as formerly, that he would (if God spared his Life,) and they might depend upon it, Return upon them with a thousand of his Salvages, if he wanted them, all Volunteers, with our Whale-boats, and would pur∣sue them to the last Extremity. The Colonels warm discourse with them
<PB N="118" REF="001800_0121_0FB82C54A26BD808"/>wrought such a consternation in them, which they discovered by their P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nick fears and trembling, their hearts sensibly heating, and rising up a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it were ready to choke them; confessed they were all his Prisoners, and beg'd of him, for JESUS sake, to Save their Lives, and the Lives of their poor Families; with such melting Terms as wrought relentings in the Colonels Breast towards them; but however, he told them, That his intent was to carry as many Prisoners home as he could, but that he had taken so many, they were more than he had occasion for, nor desired any more; and there∣fore he would leave them. The Colonel resolving the next day to com∣pleat all his action at <HI>Menis,</HI> and so draw off. Accordingly, sent his orders to Col. <HI>Goreham</HI> and Maj <HI>Hilton,</HI> with all the <HI>English</HI> Companies both Officers and Souldiers, except some few, which he thought he might have occasion for to go with the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Whale-boats up the Eastward River, where a third part of the Inhabitants Lived; that so he might prevent any re∣flection made on them, in leaving any part of the Service undone. And therefore in the evening ordered all the Whale boats to be laid ready for the Nights Service; and accordingly when the Tide Served, he went with his <HI>Indians</HI> up the River, where they did some spoil upon the Enemy going up. In the Morning several of their Transports came to meet them, to their great rejoycing, on whom they went on Board, and soon came up with the whole Fleet, with whom they joyned, bending their course directly towards <HI>Port Royal,</HI> where they were ordered. Coming to <HI>Port Royal Gut</HI> where their Ships were, and calling a Council according to his Instructions, drew up their result: Which is as followeth.</P>

<P>After this, they concluded what should be next done; which was, that the Ships should stay some Days longer at <HI>Port Royal Gut,</HI> and then go over to Mount <HI>Desart</HI> Harbour, and there stay till Col <HI>Church</HI> with his Transports came to them. Being all ready, the Colonel with his Transports &amp; Forces went up the Bay to <HI>Signecto,</HI> where they needed not a Pilot, being several of them well acquainted there: (and had nor met with so many difficulties at <HI>Menis,</HI> had it not been that their Pilot deceiv'd them; who knew nothing of the matter, kept out of the way and Landed not with them, &amp;c.) And coming to <HI>Signecto,</HI> the Enemy were all in Arms ready to receive them, Col. <HI>Church</HI> Landing his Men; the Commander of the Enemy waving his Sword over his head, bid a Challange to them: The Colonel ordering his two Wings to March up a-pace, and come upon the backs of the Enemy, himself being in the Center, and the Enemy knowing him, (having been there before) Shot chiefly at him; (but thro' Gods goodness received no harm, neither had he one Man kill'd, nor but two slightly wounded) and then ran all away into the Woods, and left their Town with nothing in it; having had timely Notice of our Forces, had carryed all away out of the reach of our Army; for Col. <HI>Church</HI> while there with part of his Forces Ranged the Woods, but to no purpose: Then returning to the Town, did them what spoil he could; ac∣cording to his Instructions, and so drew off, and made the best of their way for <HI>Pas∣samequado,</HI> (and going in) in a great Fog, one of their Transports ran upon a Rock, but was soon got off again. Then Col. <HI>Church</HI> with some of his Forces embark'd in their Whale-boats, and went amongst the Islands, with an intent to go to <HI>Sharkee's</HI> where they had destroyed the Fish; but observing a Springgy place in a Cove, went on Shore to get some Water to drink, it being a Sandy beach, they espy'd Tracks, the Colonel presently ordered his Men to scatter, and make a search; soon found <HI>De Bo∣isses</HI> Wife, who had formerly been Col. <HI>Church's</HI> Prisoner, and carried to <HI>Boston;</HI> but returned, who seemed to be very glad to see him: She had with her two Sons that were near Men grown; the Colonel ordering them a part, Examined the Woman first, who gave him this account following, That she had lived there-abouts ever since the Fleet went by, and that she had never seen but two <HI>Indians</HI> since, who came in a Cando from <HI>Norrigiwock;</HI> who ask'd her, what made her to be there alone? She told them; She had not seen a <HI>French</HI> Maninor an <HI>Indian</HI> except those two since the <HI>English</HI> Ships went by. Then the <HI>Indians</HI> told her there was not one <HI>Indian</HI> left except those two, who belong to the Gut of <HI>Cancer,</HI> on this side of <HI>Canada:</HI> for the Fryers coming down with the <HI>Indians</HI> to Monsieur <HI>Gordans,</HI> and finding the French-men slain, and their Hair spoiled, being Scalp'd, put them into a great Consternation; and the Fryerstold them it was impossible for them to live there abouts, for the <HI>English</HI> with their W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="120" REF="001800_0123_0FB82C57A1C67048"/>would serve them all so; upon which they all went up to <HI>Norrigiwock:</HI> Also told her that when the <HI>English</HI> came along thro' <HI>Penobscot,</HI> they had swept it of the Inhabi∣tants, as if-it had been swept with a Broom, neither <HI>French</HI> nor <HI>Indians</HI> escaping them: Further told her, That when their Fathers the Fryers, and the <HI>Indians</HI> met together at <HI>Norrigiwock</HI> they call'd a Council, and the Fryers told the <HI>Indians,</HI> That they must look out for some other Country, for that it was impossible for them to live there; also told them there was a River call'd <HI>Mossippos</HI> where they might live quietly and no <HI>English</HI> come near them: It being as far beyond <HI>Canada</HI> as it was to it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if they wodid go and live there, they would live &amp; dye with them, but if not they would leave them, and never come near them again. Whereupon they all agreed to go away; which they did, and left their Ruff houshold-stuff, and Corn behind them, and went all, except those two for <HI>Canada.</HI> Also her Sons giving the same Intelligence, so we had no reason to think but that it was true. Col. <HI>Church</HI> having done what he could there, Embark'd on board the Transports and went to Mount <HI>Desart,</HI> where he ex∣pected to have met with the Ships from <HI>Port Royal Gut;</HI> and going into the Harbour at Mount <HI>Desart,</HI> found no Ships there, but a Runlet rid off by a line in the Harbour, which he ordered to be taken up, and opening of it found a Letter, which gave him an account that the Ships were gone home for <HI>Boston.</HI> Then he proceeded &amp; went to <HI>Penobscot;</HI> where being come, made diligent search in those Parts for the Enemy, but could not find or make any discovery of them, or that any had been there since he left those Parts, which caus'd him to believe what <HI>De Boisses</HI> Wife had told him was true. (I will only by the way just give a hint of what we heard since of the Effects of this Expedition, &amp; then proceed.) [First, That the <HI>English</HI> Forces that went next to <HI>Norrigiwock</HI> found that the Enemy was gone, &amp; had left their Ruff houshold-stuff and Corn behind them; also not long after this Expedition, there were several Gentlemen sent down from <HI>Canada</HI> to concert with our Governour about the settling of a Cartile for the Exchange of Prisoners; and that the Governour of <HI>Canada</HI> has never since seet down any Army upon our Frontiers (as I know of) except some times a Scout of <HI>In∣dians</HI> to take some Prisoners, that he might be informed of our State, and what we were acting <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and always took care that the Prisoners so taken should be Civily Treated, and safely Returned, as I have been informed; that some of the Prisoners that were taken gave an account; so that we have great cause to believe that the Message Col. <HI>Church</HI> sent by the two <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen from <HI>Menis</HI> to the Governour of <HI>Port Royal</HI> took Effect, and was a means to bring Peace in our borders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] Then Col. <HI>Church</HI> with his Forces embark'd on board the Transports, and went to <HI>Cases Bay,</HI> where they met with Capt. <HI>Galop</HI> in a Vessel from <HI>Boston,</HI> who had brought Col <HI>Church</HI> further Or∣ders; which was to send some of his Forces up to <HI>Norrigiwock</HI> in pursuit of the Enemy; but he being sensible that the Enemy were gone from thence, and that his Souldiers were much wore-out &amp; fategu'd in the hard Service they had already done, &amp; wanted to get home, call'd a Council, and agreed all to go home, which accordingly they did. To Conclude this Expedition, I will just give a hint of some treatment Col. <HI>Church</HI> had before &amp; after he came home: for all his great Expences, Fategues &amp; Hardships in and about this Expedition, <HI>(viz)</HI> He received of his Excellency <HI>Fifteen Pounds</HI> as an earnest Peny towards Raising of Volunteers; and when he came to receive his Debenture for his Colonels Pay, there was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 4 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> due to him; and as for his Captains Pay, &amp; Man <HI>Jack</HI> he has never received any thing as yet. Also after he came home some ill mind∣ed Persons did their endeavour to have taken away his Life, for that there was some of the <HI>French</HI> Enemy Kill'd this Expedition: but his Excellency the Governour, the Honourable Council and House of Representatives saw cause to Clear him, and gave him Thanks for his good Service done.</P>
