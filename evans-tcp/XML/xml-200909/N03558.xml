<HEAD>THE Unspeakable Gift.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>II. CORINTHIANS, ix. 15.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Thanks be to</HI> GOD <HI>for his unspeakable Gift.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HANKS</HI> is the <HI>least</HI> that can be render'd for any <HI>Gift;</HI> and <HI>unspeak∣able</HI> Thanks the least for a Gift that is unspeakable. Let us consider the particular <HI>Gift</HI> here spoken of, and the <HI>Honour</HI> here done it, the <HI>Glory</HI> put upon it.</P>
<P>Some would have it to mean CHRIST Himself, who is indeed the <HI>greatest Gift</HI> of God to fallen Man, ineffa∣ble, inconceivable. John iv. 10. <HI>If thou knewest the Gift of God!</HI> Eph. iii. 8. <HI>What is the Height and Depth, and Length and Breadth of the Love of Christ, which passeth Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Some say <HI>Grace,</HI> the <HI>regenerating</HI> Grace of God; or (which is the same) the HOLY SPIRIT of God in all his <HI>saving</HI> Gifts, Graces and Comforts: And indeed all the
<PB N="2" REF="004352_0004_1004497E45527128"/><HI>Fruits of the Spirit</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> v. 22.</NOTE> are unspeakable Gifts, "<HI>Love, Peace, Joy, Longsuffering, Goodness, Meekness,</HI> &amp;c. My <HI>Context</HI>
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ver. 8.</NOTE> speaks of this Gift, "<HI>God is able to make</HI> ALL GRACE <HI>to abound to you, that ye always having an Alsufficiency in all things, may abound to every good Work.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, The <HI>Grace</HI> and the <HI>Gift by Grace</HI> here spoken of, is neither more nor less than the particular Grace of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Liberality</HI> to the Poor and Needy; an enlarged Heart and open Hand to relieve and sup∣ply them in their Wants and Necessities. — The whole <HI>Chapter</HI> is on this single <HI>Subject</HI> and Argument, touching <HI>Ministring to the Saints,</HI> v. 1. <HI>as a Master of Bounty,</HI> v. 5. <HI>sowing bountifully,</HI> v. 7. <HI>giving to the Poor,</HI> v. 9 <HI>supplying the Wants of Saints,</HI> v. 12. <HI>liberal Di∣stribution to all Men:</HI> This is the <HI>exceeding Grace</HI> and <HI>unspeakable Gift,</HI> for which <HI>Thanks</HI> is here given to God.</P>
<P>And great is the <HI>Honour and Glory</HI> done it, in the <HI>Epithet</HI> UNSPEAKABLE, and in the THANKSGIVING to God for it.</P>
<P>"<HI>Who can by searching find out</HI> GOD, or any <HI>Gift</HI> of His, <HI>unto Perfection?</HI> Who can <HI>shew forth all his Praise?</HI> All is comprehended in the one Word LOVE. Yet my <HI>Text</HI> means not to dignify a Spirit of <HI>Liberality</HI> a∣bove the <HI>other</HI> Exercises of Grace, save only as the <HI>Great∣est</HI> of all is <HI>Charity</HI>
<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 13.</NOTE>, which is but perfected at Death and <HI>abides</HI> for ever, when <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> are swallow'd up in Vision. Nevertheless it must be added, that <HI>Love</HI> in this particular <HI>Mode</HI> and Ministration, of which my <HI>Text</HI> speaks, will <HI>soon fail;</HI> for there are no Objects of <HI>Charity</HI> in <HI>Heaven,</HI> none <HI>poor</HI> or <HI>needy</HI> there: How∣ever, <HI>Benevolence,</HI> the Soul and <HI>Essence</HI> of Charity, <HI>reigns</HI> there in Glory for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Blessed be GOD that we have <HI>something</HI> and so <HI>much</HI> of it on <HI>Earth,</HI> in our <HI>Way</HI> to Heaven: "<HI>Thanks</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> for it, says my <HI>Text.</HI> The Glory is <HI>God</HI>'s, for it is
<PB N="3" REF="004352_0005_1004492D47838DB0"/><HI>his</HI> Gift, &amp; this is the Glory of the Gift that it is <HI>his;</HI> this makes it the <HI>unspeakable</HI> thing it is: Divine, Heavenly, Infinite, in its Origine, Influence and endless Effects.</P>
<P>GOD is the free and bountiful <HI>Author</HI> of this Grace in any, He <HI>gives</HI> it to Those that have it; the Ability and the Heart to do kind and liberal Things is from <HI>Him;</HI> He puts it into the Heart, and he enlarges it. "Even Power to <HI>eat</HI> our Bread is from Him, how much more to <HI>give</HI> of it to <HI>others,</HI> to <HI>seven</HI> and also to <HI>eight</HI>
<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccle.</HI> iii. 13. xi. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>liberal Man</HI> is God's Gift to the World; to the <HI>Place</HI> where he lives, to <HI>distant</HI> Places also, if he have a Hand full and <HI>strong</HI> eno' to scatter far and near. Some in the Churches of <HI>Macedonia</HI> were thus made to <HI>differ</HI> and excel: God ministred <HI>seed</HI> to them and they sowed plentifully; God <HI>curiched</HI> them unto all Bountifulness, and the <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> was abundant to God.</P>
<P>The <HI>Praise</HI> is not to the charitable Person, who <HI>de∣vises</HI> the liberal Things, but to <HI>God</HI> who gives him the Heart. The good Man will be <HI>far</HI> from taking any of the Praise to himself, but to <HI>God's Name</HI> he gives the Glory. "<HI>It is not in me,</HI> said the Princely <HI>Joseph,</HI> when <HI>Pharaoh</HI> asked him of the <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> he heard was in him; "<HI>God shall give Pharaob an Answer of Peace</HI>
<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> xli. 38.</NOTE>: He honour'd himself the more in the Sight of <HI>Pharaob</HI> and his <HI>Princes</HI> by assuming nothing to himself; "<HI>Can we find such a Man as this</HI> (said the <HI>King</HI>) <HI>in whom the Spirit of God is? for as much as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as Thou art.</HI></P>
<P>We must have a great Care not to <HI>idolise</HI> those whom God pleases to honour, by sacrificing to them instead of God, who alone is to be worship'd. Yet the <HI>Man</HI> who is God's Hand, and his <HI>Gift,</HI> comes in for a civil Honour and Respect, a grateful Acknowledgment of his own Goodwill in shewing the <HI>Kindnesses of God:</HI> of which our <HI>Context</HI> is full, <Q>For to their <HI>Power</HI> and beyond
<PB N="4" REF="004352_0006_1004498179CD0AF8"/>they were <HI>willing of themselves,</HI> praying us to receive the <HI>Gift</HI> and take on us the <HI>Fellowship;</HI></Q>
<Q>Where∣fore shew <HI>before the Churches</HI> the Proof of your Love, and of our <HI>boasting</HI> on your behalf; for I know the <HI>Forwardness</HI> of your Mind, and your Zeal has provo∣ked many:</Q>
<Q>As it is written, He has dispers'd abroad, he has given to the Poor, his <HI>Righteousness</HI> endureth for ever, his <HI>Horn</HI> shall be exalted with Honour
<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> cxii. 9.</NOTE> While by the <HI>Experiment</HI> of this Ministration they <HI>glorify God</HI> for your professed <HI>Subjection</HI> to the Gos∣pel; <HI>longing after you for the exceeding Grace of God in you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having thus set my <HI>Text</HI> in its true and best Light, I shall endeavour to speak to this <HI>Doctrine</HI> from it,</P>
<P>"That a right charitable and <HI>liberal</HI> Frame of Spirit to the <HI>poor</HI> and needy is an <HI>unspeakable Gift of God;</HI> for which great <HI>Thankfulness</HI> is due to his <HI>glorious Name,</HI> and abundant <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> should be fervently render'd in the <HI>Churches of the Saints."</HI></P>
<P>I am therefore to shew,
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> What we are to understand by a <HI>right charitable</HI> and liberal Spirit?</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> That it is an <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>3.</LABEL> The abundant <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> to be render'd for it in the <HI>Churches of Christ.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. By a right <HI>charitable</HI> and liberal Spirit, I understand a Mind and Heart <HI>prone and large,</HI> free and ready in Proportion to our <HI>Ability</HI> and the <HI>Occasions</HI> occurring to us, to pity and <HI>relieve</HI> the Wants of the <HI>Poor,</HI> more e∣specially of the virtuous and <HI>religious</HI> Poor.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>religious</HI> Exercise of the <HI>Grace</HI> of Charity, which we are to <HI>preach</HI> to you from the <HI>Gospel</HI> of Christ;
<PB N="5" REF="004352_0007_10044932EA9AF798"/>and my <HI>Context</HI> confines me to <HI>this</HI> Consideration of it, "as the <HI>Grace of God bestowed on the Churches,</HI> and the <HI>Fellowship of ministring to the Saints.</HI> So that a <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> in the Heart, and the <HI>Exercise</HI> of it in the Life, are here supposed: That is to say, a giving to the poor and needy from <HI>Faith in Christ</HI> and his <HI>Word,</HI> from <HI>Love</HI> to Him and his <HI>People,</HI> upon the <HI>Commandment</HI> and <HI>Pro∣mises</HI> of the Gospel; in <HI>Obedience</HI> to the one, and <HI>Hope</HI> in the other.</P>
<P>It is not therefore meerly a <HI>humane,</HI> tender, generous <HI>natural Temper,</HI> or <HI>acquired</HI> Disposition towards a necessi∣tous or compassionable Object; and yet <HI>this</HI> is a distin∣guishing <HI>Gift</HI> of Providence to some more than others, which renders 'em more <HI>lovely</HI> and of a superior Spirit; but we must suppose a Soul of this Disposition <HI>sanctified,</HI> and acting upon religious <HI>Principles and Motives;</HI> or one of <HI>another</HI> Disposition <HI>changed</HI> by the Power of Di∣vine Grace into <HI>this;</HI> and then what rais'd and <HI>enobled</HI> Souls do the one and other become? <HI>all their Things being done with Charity!</HI> from a reigning Love to God and Goodness as such, as there is Opportunity unto <HI>all Men,</HI> but especially unto the <HI>Houshold of Faith,</HI> proving their Love before the <HI>Churches.</HI></P>
<P>In this Case a special Exercise of proper Evangelical <HI>Faith</HI> with <HI>Love</HI> is supposed, as in the <HI>Frame</HI> of Spirit, so in the chosen <HI>Objects,</HI> poor <HI>Saints</HI> and Members of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> for <HI>His</HI> sake, and as unto <HI>Him,</HI> and as He will accept and reward another Day; "<HI>Ye did it unto Me.</HI> This is <HI>Christ form'd in us,</HI> his Spirit ruling in us, a <HI>new Nature</HI> given to us, acting in new Manner, on new Principles, Ends and Motives; such as the meer <HI>natural</HI> Man perceives not, in equal or greater Benefac∣tions; a <HI>Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God.</HI></P>
<P>It is <HI>easy</HI> to the <HI>Power</HI> of God and <HI>worthy</HI> of his <HI>Mercy,</HI> so to change the Heart of the naturally <HI>Niggard</HI> &amp; grudg∣ing, into this <HI>Riches</HI> of Benignity and Beneficence, whereof there seem to have been <HI>many Instances</HI> in the <HI>first Days</HI> of the Gospel, upon the <HI>pouring</HI> out of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> when the <HI>Multitude</HI> of them that believed were
<PB N="6" REF="004352_0008_10044984B793FB48"/>of <HI>one</HI> Heart and Soul; neither said <HI>any</HI> of them, that ought of the things they possessed were their <HI>own,</HI> but they bad all things <HI>common,</HI> Acts iv. <HI>ult.</HI> An <HI>extraordinary</HI> Spirit of <HI>Love,</HI> at an extraordinary Time and Occasion! a wonderful Effusion of the HOLY GHOST, from the late crucified and ascended JESUS. The like therefore has not been known in <HI>ordinary</HI> Times, nor is it the <HI>standing</HI> Exercise of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in the sanctified. But the <HI>Want</HI> of what should be <HI>common</HI> among Christians at <HI>all</HI> Times, is a sad and <HI>dark</HI> Testimony of the <HI>Poverty</HI> of Grace; for there certainly are among us People of <HI>high Profession,</HI> who have <HI>no</HI> Heart to do almost any thing at all, in a way of <HI>Distribution</HI> to the Poor, or for pious Uses; no not a known Instance for Years together; while God is liberally giving to them, and they can lay up and lay out and make Purchases! but if you speak of <HI>giving,</HI> they <HI>hide themselves from their own Flesh,</HI> even tho' they be esteemed <HI>Members of Christ</HI> also.</P>
<P>Let us always see to it, that our <HI>Principle and End</HI> be right before God, genuine and truly <HI>Christian;</HI> that neither <HI>Vanity,</HI> Affectation or Ostentation, nor yet meer <HI>Humanity</HI> and good Nature, be <HI>pass'd on God</HI> for gra∣cious <HI>Charity,</HI> on Whom it cannot; nor yet on <HI>Men,</HI> nor on <HI>our selves,</HI> which also is next to impossible under our Illuminations by the Gospel. Wherefore our <HI>Lord,</HI> according to the infinite Wisdom and Sanctity of God in Him, has warned us to <HI>take heed how we do our Alms,</HI> Iest we have no Reward from <HI>our Father in Heaven.</HI> Matth. vi.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am now to show, that this Evangelical Christian <HI>charitable Frame</HI> of Spirit is an <HI>unspeakable Gift of God.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Literally true it is, that <HI>no Tongue</HI> of Man can duely speak of it, or enough praise and <HI>celebrate</HI> it. It is above all our Thoughts and Words, we can neither think or speak of it as it merits. Such is every <HI>Work</HI> and Gift of God in the Kingdom of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Providence.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004352_0009_100441C675C1FE50"/>"See that thou <HI>magnify</HI> these visible Works, which <HI>Eyes of Flesh</HI> behold. "<HI>His Work is honourable and glorious, and his Praise endureth for Ever.</HI> How much more his <HI>Spiritual Work,</HI> the <HI>Gift by Grace</HI> within thy Self and Others. The <HI>Angels</HI> of God <HI>pry</HI> silently into <HI>this,</HI> and we need <HI>their</HI> Eyes and Tongues to look into it and speak of it. "Bless the Lord ye his <HI>Angels</HI> that excel in Strength! and "<HI>awake up our Glory</HI> too, though we be but <HI>Babes and Sucklings</HI> in comparison of Them; for from <HI>our</HI> Mind and Mouth God has <HI>ordained</HI> Strength.—We <HI>lisp</HI> and stammer at a proper Word, and poorly apprehend many of the Great Words put into our Mouth. "Let Him <HI>teach</HI> us what we shall say! and shall it be <HI>told</HI> Him that we speak! who can <HI>utter</HI> his mighty Acts, or shew forth all his Praise! —Ac∣cordingly the Apostle <HI>labours</HI> in my <HI>Context,</HI> to speak of the <HI>Gift</HI> of God; seems at a <HI>loss,</HI> speaks abundantly, over and over, and knows not when he has said enough of the excellent Grace: <Q><HI>Inriched,</HI> says he, <HI>in every thing,</HI> to all <HI>Bountifulness,</HI> which is <HI>abundant</HI> by many Thanksgivings to God, from those that <HI>long</HI> after you for the <HI>exceeding</HI> Grace of God in you.</Q>— If a Man wou'd speak of a thing <HI>unspeakable,</HI> it must be just after <HI>this manner;</HI> it being literally true, that <HI>no Tongue</HI> of Man can fully speak the Praises of Christian <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Unspeakable</HI> is the <HI>Good done</HI> in the World by a right <HI>charitable</HI> Frame of Spirit. Unspeakable are the <HI>Needs</HI> which Sin has brought upon us, not only on the <HI>poor and low</HI> of the World, but also on <HI>others,</HI> even on the richest and highest. We unspeakably need one anothers <HI>Help</HI> and Service, and unspeakable are the <HI>Benefits</HI> we receive from others in our Necessities. The <HI>poor</HI> serve the <HI>rich</HI> abundantly, more especially in their <HI>Sicknesses;</HI> and very often do it <HI>gratis,</HI> for nothing, out of pure Humanity, Respect and Compassion, and are never requited: Sometimes from <HI>Gratitude</HI> for Favours received, and as often (I would wish) from a Principle of <HI>Grace</HI> within them, it being all the Way they have to express a <HI>pious Love</HI> to God &amp; their Neighbours.—Others to whom God has given Riches, and <HI>Largeness</HI> of Heart
<PB N="8" REF="004352_0010_1004498640425090"/>to do Good with it, give <HI>Portions</HI> to the Poor by sevens and eights, and by scores and hundreds; <HI>devising</HI> li∣beral things, and casting their <HI>Bread</HI> upon the Waters. <Q>The <HI>Bowels</HI> of the poor are refreshed by them, they are Eyes to the <HI>blind</HI> and Feet to the <HI>lame,</HI> Parents to the <HI>Fatherless,</HI> and they cause the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Heart to sing; the Blessing of them that are ready to <HI>perish</HI> comes on them, and of him that is <HI>helpless.</HI></Q> They are as the Heat and Rain to a thirsty and cold Earth, as the <HI>Light</HI> of the Morning and the <HI>Dews</HI> of the Even∣ing to those among whom they dwell, who pass their <HI>Days and Nights</HI> the better for their Neighbourhood. <Q>Their Glory is <HI>fresh</HI> in them, and their <HI>Bow</HI> is re∣newed in their Hand.</Q> They live not to <HI>Themselves,</HI> but others <HI>glean</HI> by handfuls of what they plentifully sowe. God <HI>multiply</HI> their Seed sown, and <HI>increase</HI> the Fruits of their Righteousness; while the <HI>Loyns</HI> of the Poor bless them, warm'd with the <HI>Fleece</HI> of their Flock. These are the Men of whom we shall <HI>hear well</HI> another Day, but how will they be able to <HI>bear the Joy</HI> of the blessed Words! <Q><HI>I was hungry and ye gave me Meat, thirsty and ye gave me Drink, naked and ye clothed me, a Stranger and ye took me in</HI></Q>. Unspeakable (you see) is the <HI>Good done</HI> in this needy World, and <HI>Heaven</HI> ac∣knowledges it to be so, and accordingly <HI>rates the Gift</HI> in the Book of Account.</P>
<P N="3">3. Unspeakable is <HI>the Glory redounding to</HI> GOD from a right Christian <HI>charitable</HI> Frame of Spirit, in the noble humble Exercise of it thro' the Earth, and therefore is it an <HI>unspeakable Gift.</HI> This is a <HI>Reason</HI> or Argument that rises much higher than the former; for if it be a good and great Thing to do much Good to our Fellow-Crea∣tures, how much more is it to be any Ways Instrumen∣tal in any <HI>Glory and Honour</HI> to the Name of GOD? Yet HE <HI>is glorified</HI> (says my Context) by <HI>Others,</HI> on the Account of the Acts of <HI>Bounty</HI> done them by their mer∣ciful Neighbour.</P>
<P>The Great and bountiful <HI>God</HI> makes <HI>much,</HI> makes the <HI>most</HI> of our <HI>little Alms</HI> and Offerings to Him: As our <HI>Saviour</HI> did of the <HI>Widow's two Mites;</HI> they were
<PB N="9" REF="004352_0011_100449A97A9F3B90"/>a <HI>rich</HI> Offering in his Eye, and he <HI>magnify'd</HI> it and her. So God <HI>shines on his own Works</HI> wrought in us and by us, and puts great <HI>Honour</HI> on 'em, makes great <HI>Account</HI> of 'em. And so in the last Day he will glorify <HI>Himself</HI> in glorifying his <HI>Elect,</HI> <Q><HI>In as much as ye have done it to the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>We are bid to <Q>let our Lights <HI>shine before Men,</HI> that they <HI>seeing</HI> our good Works may <HI>glorify our Fa∣ther</HI> which is in Heaven.</Q> The <HI>liberal Man</HI> does so, but <HI>not</HI> to be seen of Men. There is that is <HI>manifest,</HI> and cannot be <HI>hid.</HI> Men do not light a <HI>Candle</HI> and put it under a <HI>Bushel.</HI> A good Man blesses God for the Light that shines on <HI>others,</HI> as well as on Himself. If <HI>one</HI> is inriched to all Bountifulness, it causes in <HI>others</HI> Thanksgiving to God; yea is abundant by <HI>many</HI> Thanks∣givings to Him, says my <HI>Context:</HI> "They <HI>glorify</HI> God for your professed Subjection to the Gospel, and <HI>pray</HI> unto God for you.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>least Glory</HI> to God is an <HI>unspeakable</HI> thing. What is <HI>Man,</HI> and what the <HI>World</HI> he lives in, and what the <HI>Riches</HI> thereof, and you will say what the <HI>poor</HI> of it, that GOD should have <HI>Glory</HI> from them! "<HI>Be∣hold He putteth no Trust in his Saints, and the Heavens are not clean in his Sight! how much less Man that is a Worm!</HI> What then can <HI>Man</HI> think or speak of, ask or <HI>pray</HI> for, like to <HI>this! Father in Heaven, thy Name be hallowed!— for Thine is the Kingdom and Power and Glory for ever!</HI> Well is it made the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the <HI>first</HI> and the <HI>last,</HI> in our Prayers. It must be the <HI>everlasting Law and Motive</HI> to us, respecting giving and receiving; 1 Peter iv. 11. <HI>If any Man minister, of the Ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be Praise and Dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Good to our selves</HI> is unspeakable, in a <HI>liberal</HI> and bountiful Spirit, and therefore it is an <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> to us and in us. Unspeakable is the <HI>present Comfort</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004352_0012_100449895AA866E0"/>to a good Man by this <HI>Gift,</HI> and unspeakable is the <HI>future and eternal Reward</HI> of it in the Life to come.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we consider only the <HI>Pleasure</HI> and Comfort of it to a Man in <HI>this Life,</HI> to be of a merciful and <HI>bountiful Eye,</HI> it is to him an unspeakable Gift. He is <HI>satisfied in Himself,</HI> God answers him in <HI>the Joy of his Heart.</HI> The greatest Pleasure of Life is to <HI>be</HI> good and <HI>do</HI> good. The Words of our <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> are to be had in everlasting Remembrance, "<HI>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</HI> The Man's <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Frame</HI> is more blessed; unless it be when the <HI>poor</HI> Man exceeds in <HI>Grace,</HI> in the <HI>manner</HI> of his receiving; and then the <HI>Tide</HI> turns on his Side.</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> tells us the <HI>Pleasure</HI> he found in Acts of <HI>Munifi∣cence</HI> in the Days of his Prosperity; and it was unspeak∣able: <Q>When the <HI>Ear</HI> heard me, it <HI>blessed</HI> me! when the <HI>Eye</HI> saw me it gave <HI>witness</HI> to me! then said I, I shall <HI>die in my Nest,</HI> or <HI>multiply my Days</HI> as the Sand! my <HI>Root</HI> was <HI>spread out</HI> by the Waters, and the <HI>Dew</HI> lay all Night upon my <HI>Branch!</HI> my <HI>Glory</HI> was fresh in me, and my <HI>Bow</HI> was renewed in my Hand! they waited for me as for the <HI>Rain,</HI> and opened their Mouth <HI>wide</HI> as for the latter Rain! I chose out their Way and sat <HI>Chief,</HI> and dwelt as a <HI>King</HI> in his Army; as <HI>One</HI> that comforteth the Mourners.</Q></P>
<P>Even all the <HI>bitter Sorrows of Job</HI> could not take away the Comfort of the Remembrance of his <HI>past Joys</HI> in Acts of <HI>Charity</HI> &amp; Mercy. "<HI>If</HI> (said he) <HI>I had with-held the poor from his Desire,"</HI>— O the <HI>Pleasure</HI> of yeilding them <HI>their Desire,</HI> when it is <HI>pious</HI> and just, and the <HI>Power</HI> be in our Hand, and our <HI>Heart</HI> be big enough;—or <Q>if I <HI>caused the Eyes of the Widow to fail!</HI> If <HI>I eat my Morsel alone,</HI> and the <HI>Fatherless</HI> did not share with me! for from my <HI>Youth</HI> I was his <HI>Father,</HI> and Widow's <HI>Guide.</HI></Q> —I tell you, that as the <HI>Heart</HI> knows its own <HI>Bitterness,</HI> so only the Heart of a <HI>Job</HI> knows the <HI>Comfort</HI> of a Con∣sciousness of such a <HI>Frame</HI> and Exercise, as this which his own Words have spoken, and who can add to them? How did all the <HI>Good</HI> he had ever done to the Poor <HI>re∣turn</HI> into his own <HI>Bosom,</HI> and <HI>flow out</HI> of his <HI>Lips</HI> from
<PB N="11" REF="004352_0013_100449AC2C1C8E88"/>the <HI>Abundance</HI> in his <HI>heart!</HI> The <HI>Objects of Charity</HI> were always to him <HI>as his own Bowels,</HI> and how were his <HI>Bowels refresh'd</HI> hereby, at the Time and long after. He <HI>felt</HI> the ruling Power of Grace, and had <HI>Confidence</HI> toward God. The <HI>Joy of Faith and Hope</HI> accompanied and follow'd the Exercise of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>brotherly Kind∣ness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But the Great and last, the <HI>infinite and eternal Re∣wards</HI> of Grace, to the <HI>charitable</HI> and godly Man, are in the Blessedness and Glories of <HI>the World to come,</HI> and these render the <HI>Gift</HI> of Grace to him and in him <HI>un∣speakable.</HI> <Q><HI>Eye</HI> has not seen this, nor <HI>Ear</HI> heard it, nor can it enter into our <HI>Hearts</HI> to conceive of it. When <HI>the Son of Man</HI> shall come in <HI>his Glory,</HI> and <HI>fashion</HI> his <HI>Elect</HI> and Merciful Ones after <HI>his own glori∣ous Body,</HI> and say to 'em in the Hearing of all his <HI>holy Angels,</HI>—</Q>
<Q>Come ye <HI>blessed</HI> of my Father, inherit the <HI>Kingdom</HI> prepared for you from the Foundation of the World!</Q> <HI>for I was hungry and ye gave me Meat,</HI> &amp;c. —O with what <HI>Rapture</HI> will they make the <HI>humble An∣swer,</HI> "Lord, <HI>when</HI> saw we thee <HI>hungry</HI> and <HI>fed</HI> thee, or <HI>thirsty</HI> and gave thee <HI>Drink?</HI>—The <HI>Day</HI> must reveal it, what the <HI>Joy</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI> and of his <HI>Members</HI> will then be! then they shall be <HI>recompenc'd,</HI> at the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Just.

<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="004352_0014_1004498D6F724938"/>
III. The <HI>highest Thanksgivings</HI> are due from us to the <HI>blessed God,</HI> for this <HI>his unspeakable Gift</HI> to any of the Children of Men; and should be <HI>fervently render'd</HI> to Him in the <HI>Churches</HI> of his Saints. "<HI>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable Gift.</HI></P>
<P>But (as was said before) <HI>what</HI> Thanks can <HI>we</HI> ren∣der, when the Gift is <HI>unspeakable?</HI> O 'tis <HI>above</HI> all our Praises and Blessings! Yet as the <HI>Levites</HI> said to the August Congregation, Nehem ix. 5. "<HI>Stand up and bless the Lord your God for ever and ever! and bless∣ed be thy glorious Name which is exalted above all Praise.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only say <HI>two</HI> Things here,</P>
<P N="1">1. They that <HI>receive</HI> the Gift should be very <HI>thank∣ful</HI> to God for it. The charitable Person should him∣self give <HI>Thanks</HI> to God for making him so, while yet he <HI>abases</HI> himself before the Lord, as an unprofitable Creature, and behaves humble and lowly before <HI>Men.</HI> Yet ought he to glorify God for any <HI>Heart</HI> to do good, and for any <HI>Means</HI> to do it. He must assume nothing to <HI>himself,</HI> but ascribe all to <HI>God;</HI> of Whom and <HI>to Whom</HI> are all things. "For what hast <HI>thou</HI> which is not receiv∣ed? and if received, whereof hast thou to <HI>glory?</HI> The Glory belongs to Him who has given to <HI>thee,</HI> that <HI>thou</HI> may'st give to others. As, suppose a rich and charitable Person puts into my Hand a <HI>Sum</HI> or Sums of Money to distribute unto others in Want; it is <HI>his</HI> Gift and Bounty, and not mine; and <HI>I</HI> ought to be thankful to Him to∣gether with those to whom I distribute. In like man∣ner if GOD give <HI>You</HI> Ability and a Heart to do good to others, you owe the <HI>first</HI> Thanks to God, and shou'd be ready to say with the <HI>Church, "Not unto us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy Name be Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You,</HI> my <HI>Brethren!</HI> that are honoured of God to <HI>give</HI> unto the poor, might have been your selves, and so your Families, among the <HI>indigent</HI> and necessitous! You might have been <HI>Receivers</HI> of the Charities of others, the Ob∣jects of their Compassion.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004352_0015_100441C986FF2EF8"/>
Or yet <HI>worse,</HI> You might have been among the nig∣gardly and <HI>covetous</HI> in the midst of Riches; not able to <HI>eat</HI> of your own Bread, and less to give unto others! An <HI>Evil</HI> too often seen and felt, a Misery too common under the <HI>Sun,</HI> which yet shines liberally on the niggard Soul.</P>
<P>Or still worse, You might have been among the <HI>frau∣dulent and unjust,</HI> the Cheat, the Theif and the Robber; or (which is little better) the Gripe and the Extortioner, the Spoiler of the Widow, the motherless and fatherless! But who has made you to <HI>differ?</HI> made Thee a <HI>Bene∣factor</HI> and Blessing to the World, among these Plagues and Curses in it? GOD, who is rich in Mercy, and <HI>So∣vereign</HI> in his Gifts and Grace to Men, <HI>He</HI> has done it! "Who has Mercy because he <HI>will</HI> have Mercy. He that made <HI>Abel Cain</HI>'s Brother, and gave to <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> their <HI>Grandeur</HI> of Heart.</P>
<P>Let <HI>free Grace</HI> therefore have all the Glory; as the Apostle teaches us, Ephes. 3.18. <HI>To me, who am less than the least of all Saints is this Grace given.</HI> So <HI>thou</HI> <Q>by the <HI>Grace</HI> of God art what thou art, and his Grace given thee has not been <HI>in vain!</HI> And if you <HI>labour</HI> more than others, yet not <HI>you,</HI> but the Grace of God in You.</Q>—So when <HI>David</HI> had done a <HI>kingly</HI> part, and his <HI>Princes</HI> a very <HI>princely</HI> one, in way of Offer∣ings out of their Estates; then <HI>David</HI> said before the Lord, 1 Chron. xxix. 14. <Q><HI>But who am I O Lord God, and what is my People, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort! for all things come of Thee and of thy own have we given thee.</HI></Q>— Thus they that <HI>receive the Gift,</HI> should give <HI>Thanks</HI> for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Others,</HI> but especially the <HI>poor and needy,</HI> they should be very <HI>thankful</HI> to God. The <HI>Charitable</HI> are <HI>God's Gifts to Men,</HI> even to the <HI>rebellious;</HI> (and indeed <HI>such</HI> themselves among their <HI>Brethren</HI>) <HI>that the Lord God might dwell among us.</HI> I may lawfully <HI>transfer</HI> these Words from <HI>Ministers</HI> in the Church, to the <HI>liberal</HI> in the Flocks; for it is the same <HI>God</HI> and the same <HI>Grace</HI> that forms both the one and the other, to serve the
<PB N="14" REF="004352_0016_100441A7883B21C8"/><HI>Needs</HI> of Souls and Bodies. "We <HI>do you to wit</HI> there∣fore of the <HI>Grace of God</HI> bestowed on the <HI>Churches,</HI> in both. The same <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> that descended on the <HI>Apostles</HI> in Tongues of Fire, came down on the <HI>Multi∣tude of Believers</HI> at that memorable Time and they had <HI>all things common.</HI> And now the <HI>ordinary</HI> Gifts of your <HI>Ministers</HI> for the Service of your Souls, and the ordinary Spirit of <HI>Charity</HI> in our Churches, are from the same Fulness, of <HI>Christ;</HI> of Whom all do receive and Grace upon Grace. He puts the <HI>earnest Care</HI> for Soul and Body into the one and other; whether it be <HI>Titus</HI> or <HI>Gaius,</HI> doing faithfully for the <HI>Brethren</HI> or <HI>Strangers.</HI></P>
<P>The Gifts and Graces of <HI>others,</HI> and the <HI>Use</HI> God pleases to make of them, should be <HI>pleasant</HI> to us and <HI>admired</HI> by us; and we should rejoice in all that we see of God in them. We should prize the good <HI>Examples</HI> they give us, give God the <HI>Glory</HI> of them, and be ex∣cited to a holy Imitation. 1. Thess. iii. 9. <HI>For what Thanks can we render unto God for you? for all the Joy wherewith we joy before our God for your sakes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>poor</HI> especially should be very <HI>thankful to God,</HI> for his unspeakable Gift to <HI>them,</HI> in all the <HI>Charities</HI> of the rich and bountiful. They should religiously accept the Gift of Heaven in <HI>those</HI> whom they must call their <HI>Benefactors.</HI> They should look thro' and above <HI>Men</HI> un∣to God, who gives by their Hands. They must no more <HI>idolize</HI> Men, than they would bow down to an <HI>Image</HI> of Wood or Gold; no more than they would <HI>kiss the Calves,</HI> or their <HI>Hand</HI> to the <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>Moon</HI> in their Bright∣ness; for this were to deny the <HI>most high</HI> and first Be∣nefactor. "<HI>Why look ye so earnestly at us?</HI> said <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to the wondring and almost worshipping Peo∣ple at the Gate of the Temple, when they had in the Name of <HI>Jesus</HI> given <HI>more</HI> than Silver or Gold to the <HI>Cripple,</HI> even <HI>Feet</HI> to walk and leap. What is a boun∣tiful <HI>Donor</HI> to us, but a <HI>Steward</HI> and <HI>Almoner</HI> of God, his kind and open Hand! Who shall have the <HI>Praise?</HI> the <HI>King</HI> that orders his <HI>Medals</HI> to be strowed among the Crowd, or the <HI>Servitor</HI> that scatters 'em at his Com∣mand? <HI>Jacob</HI> saw the Face of God in <HI>Esau</HI>'s Affection,
<PB N="15" REF="004352_0017_100449B09776AB08"/>when he <HI>ran</HI> with open Arms and Eyes full of Tears to embrace him. So let the <HI>poor</HI> see the Face and Hand of <HI>God,</HI> in all the Heart and Care of <HI>others</HI> for them. They are what God makes 'em, and he has made 'em <HI>such</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>God knows the irreligious <HI>poor,</HI> ungrateful to Him, <HI>unthankful and unholy,</HI> who receive and eat and give him not Thanks. It may be they <HI>how</HI> to Men, and <HI>treble</HI> their Thanks to them and <HI>bless</HI> 'em, and yet do <HI>not</HI> lift their Hearts at all to God. It may be they neither <HI>pray</HI> for themselves or others in secret, altho' their <HI>Depen∣dance</HI> is so great on Providence and its Instruments; nor do they <HI>bless God</HI> when he sends 'em in Supplies.—God <HI>values</HI> the Thanks of the <HI>Poor</HI> as much as of the Rich, and they as much <HI>owe</HI> it to Him. Let 'em learn the Song of <HI>Hannah,</HI> and sing it with her gracious Spirit, 1 Sam. 2. <HI>init "My Heart rejoices in the Lord, my Horn is ex∣alted in the Lord: He maketh poor and maketh rich; the hungry cease, and the rich have hired out themselves for Bread.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus at large consider'd the <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> of God, in a right <HI>charitable</HI> Frame of Spirit, and the <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> and Praise due from us unto God therefor, I might naturally go into a large <HI>Compass</HI> of Meditation on <HI>other</HI> the unspeakable Gifts of God to us, all of which are more or less related unto <HI>this</HI> that I have been speak∣ing of; and it may be I could not well go into a more proper and profitable <HI>Application of the Subject.</HI></P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Look we <HI>within our selves,</HI> into our own <HI>Souls</HI> and Bodies, fram'd as they are for <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> to God, and for all <HI>Offices of Humanity and Charity</HI> to our Nei'bours; what a <HI>Gift of God</HI> is this <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Heart,</HI> and these <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Hands;</HI> first to lift up to <HI>God,</HI> and then to look and reach out to <HI>his poor!</HI> this <HI>social Nature</HI> for wor∣shipping and communicating! In every <HI>Relation</HI> and in all <HI>Offices</HI> of Human Life, <HI>publick</HI> and <HI>private,</HI> wherein God has plac'd us to <HI>serve</HI> and <HI>bless</HI> one another; what Gifts of God <HI>unspeakable</HI> ought every One to be unto
<PB N="16" REF="004352_0018_1004498F0C6BDAF8"/>his <HI>Correlate</HI> and therein to the <HI>Community!</HI> from the Consort, Parent and Child, up to the <HI>King</HI> on the Throne; and down again from all that <HI>rule</HI> under Him, to the <HI>lowest</HI> Subject in the State!—What a <HI>wide Compass</HI> of unspeakable Blessings wou'd every Person, in every Or∣der, present us with? all under the <HI>Law of Kindness,</HI> and all their <HI>Things done with Charity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. What an <HI>unspeakable</HI> Gift therefore is a good <HI>Go∣vernment,</HI> good Magistrates, wise, pious, faithful, pub∣lic-spirited Rulers; great and good <HI>Kings, Princes, No∣bles, Governours, Legislators,</HI> and <HI>Judges:</HI> Whom we are bid to <HI>pray</HI> for, and are bound to give <HI>Thanks</HI> for; while under them we are living <HI>quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godliness and Honesty.</HI> 2 Sam. xxiii. 1,—4. <HI>He shall be at the Light of the Morning when the Sun ariseth, even a Morning without Clouds; and as the ten∣der Grass springing out of the Earth by clear shining after Rain.</HI> Such <HI>Gifts</HI> from Heaven were <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua, Samuel</HI> and <HI>David, Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> to the <HI>Israel</HI> of God, in their Generation.</P>
<P N="3">3. What an <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> of God to us is our <HI>Church-State,</HI> our <HI>spiritual</HI> Relation in Christ, our <HI>Fel∣lowship</HI> in the Gospel, our <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> the <HI>Vocation</HI> wherewith we are called! to be a <HI>spiritual House,</HI> a <HI>Kingdom of Priests,</HI> a <HI>chosen Generation,</HI> a <HI>peculiar People and Treasure,</HI> to shew forth the <HI>Praises</HI> of our God and Saviour. Your <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> the preached <HI>Gospel,</HI> the <HI>Or∣dinances</HI> of our God, and the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Religion; these are among the <HI>Gifts</HI> from the <HI>Ascended Jesus.</HI> As it is written, — <Q>I gave them my <HI>Sabbaths</HI> for a <HI>Sign</HI> between Me and them that I am the Lord that doth <HI>sanctify</HI> them

<P>But to <HI>leave</HI> all things here <HI>below,</HI> and to <HI>ascend up far above all Heavens,</HI> I add</P>

<PB N="18" REF="004352_0020_100441AE8936BFD8"/>Iniquity, to bring in an Everlasting <HI>Righteousness</HI> for the Justification of Sinners. The <HI>crucified Jesus</HI> is such a 2 Gift of God to the Sons of Men, as infinitely tran∣scends the Tongues of <HI>Angels,</HI> when they would give Him the Glory of it. They <HI>desire to look into it,</HI> and give <HI>Glory in the Highest.</HI> The <HI>Elders</HI> with them pre∣pare <HI>new Songs</HI> for ever, and <HI>cast their Crowns before the Throne.</HI></P>
<P>How then shall the Tongues of <HI>Men</HI> below be able to speak of the <HI>Gift</HI> of God to us in the <HI>Incarnation, Obedience, Death, Resurrection</HI> and <HI>Intercession</HI> of CHRIST, or of his <HI>Coming again</HI> in Glory for the Salvation of those that believe in Him!—Here all Words are <HI>swal∣lowed up,</HI> we are struck mute, &amp; Praise sits silent. Isai. ix. 6. <HI>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his Shoulder: And his Name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace!</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>this</HI> (my <HI>Brethren</HI>) is the <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> of God unto us, to be in in <HI>Everlasting Remembrance</HI> with us in all our <HI>Worship</HI> before Him, secret, private and public; every Lord's-Day and all our Communion-Days: In every <HI>Ordinance</HI> of Worship He is <HI>offer'd</HI> to us for our thankful <HI>Acceptance,</HI> to be of God made unto us <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification</HI> and <HI>Redemption!</HI> and <HI>we</HI> must be making the Offering of <HI>our Selves</HI> to Him, as <HI>bought with a Price, living Sacrifices, which is our reasonable Service, holy and acceptable to God. Grace</HI> to do this, is an <HI>unspeakable Gift</HI> indeed.</P>
<P>Therefore we must give equal Glory to the HOLY GHOST, yielding our Selves to <HI>Him,</HI> as the blessed <HI>Sanctifier, proceeding from the Father and the Son! One</HI> with the REDEEMER in <HI>Godhead</HI> and everlasting <HI>Love</HI> to Souls. John xiv. 16. <HI>The Comforter, whom I will send unto You from the Father, He shall receive of Mine and shew it unto you.</HI></P>
<P>This Heavenly <HI>Gift</HI> rested on <HI>Moses and the Elders, Patriarchs</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> sanctified and inspired them.

John vii. 37. <HI>In the last and great Day of the Feast Jesus stood and cried, saying, "If any Man thirst, let him come unto me and drink, and out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water: This spake He of the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>which they that believe on him shall receive.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST and the HOLY GHOST are the <HI>One,</HI> inseper∣able, undivided, infinite, eternal, and therefore <HI>unspeak∣able Gift of</HI> GOD. Let us <HI>wait</HI> for it as for the <HI>Rain,</HI> and <HI>open</HI> our Mouth <HI>wide</HI> for it as for the <HI>latter</HI> Rain. God <HI>fill</HI> us with this Blessing of Blessings. Revel. xxii. 17. "<HI>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come; and let him that is athirst come; and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely.</HI></P>
