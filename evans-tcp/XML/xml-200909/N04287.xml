</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MAN was orginally form'd &amp; de∣sign'd by the glorious, bounteous and beneficent Author of his be∣ing, for Religion and Happiness; and in a wise &amp; harmonious subserviency here∣unto for Society, mutual Converse, Commerce, Aid and Helpfulness: As is evident from his original Make, Frame and Constitution; and likewise from the Oracles of Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="005295_0004_1016F458F6401B78"/>
<HI>Adam</HI> was first form'd then <HI>Eve:</HI> For the LORD God said, <HI>It is not good that the man should be alone.</HI> And if the first man <HI>Adam</HI> while in a state of Innocence, would have been uneasie, even in the garden of <HI>Eden</HI> and grop'd for happiness in the midst of Paradise: at least would not have been so happy as his Nature (which was a Copy of the Divine and therefore Communicative) was capable of, for want of a Companion of his own Species; a Fellow-helper and a Partner in his Joys, had not God made him an <HI>Help-meet for him:</HI> If Company was necessary to compleat his Fe∣licity while in a state of integrity &amp; perfecti∣on; surely we in this lapsed State, can't sub∣sist and live independent one of another. Naked &amp; helpless come we out of our Mothers womb and should soon return thither, shou'd die from the womb and give up the ghost as soon as born, did not the knees prevent us &amp; the breasts that we should suck. Nor are or wants diminished as our days or years are mul∣tiplied, but rather grow and increase upon us: Wo therefore to him that is alone and hath not another to help him.</P>
<P>Mankind cousider's as divided into different and distinct Families, Churches, Towns, Go∣vernments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are Members one of another, and thence obliged to be Social. God hath so set and plac'd the several Members of each
<PB N="3" REF="005295_0005_1016F45BC23C6340"/>Body-politick of each Comminity whether Civil or Ecclesiastical, that the Eye cannot say to the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor a∣gain the Hand to the Foot, I have no need of thee: For as in the Boby-natural, if one Mem∣ber rejoice, all the Members rejoicce with it; and <HI>e. c.</HI> if one Member suffer, all the Mem∣bers suffer with it; so it is here, — The King cannot subsift without his Subjects; (for <HI>the King is served by the Field</HI>) neither can the Subejct be safe and happy without their Sove∣reign. When there is no King in Israel every one does what is right in his own eyes: The dire Effects, fatal and destructive Conse∣quences of which, have made mankind long since, generally give into that Maxim, viz. <HI>That Tyranny it self is better and more elegible than Anarchy.</HI> Had we no Ruler over us, alas! how soon should we become like the Fishes of the Sea that devour one another?</P>
<P>Well then, Since it is our interest to be un∣der civil Government, it must needs be our bounden duty to Revere, Honour and Obey them that have the Rule over us; to be subject to the higher Powers, to the King as Supream, and unto Governours and Maginstrates and all in Civil Authority as unto them that are sent by Him, derive their Authority from Him, and act in His Majesty's Name, Ac∣cordingly, we find this duty strictly injoin'd &amp;
<PB N="4" REF="005295_0006_1016F460015BDAC8"/>frequently inculcated on us throughout the Revelations of God; and particularly in the passage of sacred Writ and words of Inspira∣tion which I have now read to you. Which words are found among the sage, judicious &amp; pithy Sentences or wise Sayings of Solomon the Son of David King of Israel; who was a di∣vinely inspir'd Preacher, and spake as he was moved by the Holy Gohst</P>
<P>'Tis said he spake three Thousand Proverbs, and in this divine Collection of them his Doctrine drop'd as the Rain, his Speech distill'd as the Dew, as the small Rain upon the tender Herb and as the Showers upon the Grass: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet David his Royal Father, saying, <HI>He shall come down like the Rain on the mown Grass and as the Showers that water the Earth, Psal.</HI> 72. 6.</P>
<P>It would now be an invasion of the Priests Office for Civil Rulers (as it is for any others who are not call'd of God as was Aaron) to take this honour to themselves, <HI>viz.</HI> to be publick Teachers or Exhorters. (<HI>The Lord rebuke the madness of all such false Prophets who run before they are sent; such Sons of Chorah, such presumptuous Ʋzza's who venture to touch the Ark.</HI>) Nevertheless in the days of Inspiration and while the Mosaick Oeconomy and Legal Ad∣ministration lasted, we find that some who
<PB N="5" REF="005295_0007_1016F462B8E5FAA0"/>were Kings were likewise Prophets and Teachers. So Solomon by God's Command∣ment was anointed King, and by his Spirit was made the Preacher: Nor does this great and renowned Prince think it beneath the dig∣nity of his Royal Character to undertake the Instruction of others in things pertaining to God and Religion; — For 'tis manifestly his great Scope and Design in this (as also in his Book call'd <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI>) to teach men <HI>the fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wis∣dom, and to depart from evil which is understanding.</HI> See <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.1, — 4.</P>
<P>Happy were they that continually stood be∣fore him and heard his wisdom; and happy are we that have these Divine <HI>Aphorisms</HI> copied out and handed down to us: But especially since we know these things, happy are we if we do them.</P>
<P>Among many other Excellent words of Counsel, documents of Wisdom, precepts and rules of Living contain'd in this Book, calcula∣ted and tending to render us happy both here and hereafter, our Text is one; which is in∣troduc'd with this loving &amp; endearing, kind and winning Compellation, <HI>My Son,</HI> — A term or title expressive of his tender Affection and paternal Regards to his fellow Men; of his pitying them like as a Father pities his Children. And it may likewise be design'd
<PB N="6" REF="005295_0008_1016F46441E6FFE0"/>to intimate to his Hearers that they ought (as becomes Children) to be of a docible, tracta∣ble, teachable disposition, ready and forward to learn, to hearken to and follow wholsom &amp; good Advice.</P>
<P>The Counsel of GOD and the Divine Cau∣tion here given, is (if I mistake not) peculiar∣ly Seasonable for us at this <HI>Present Day.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore we shall now endeavour briefly to Explain and Inforce the same.</P>
<P>The words may be divided into Three parts or distinct Heads of Discourse, which I shall a little Expatiate and Inlarge upon, in the Order wherein they here stand plac'd.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. The first is, — <HI>Fear thou the LORD,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Now to fear the Lord, is to be truly, sincerely and practically Religious and Godly, or Holy in heart and life. The phrase denotes <HI>universal Piety:</HI> And we are here implicitly injoin'd to labour after all that spiritual &amp; divine Know∣lege, Faith, Love, Repentance, Reverence, Fear, Hope and holy Obedience which the Gospel makes requisite and necessary in order to our finding Acceptance with God and be∣ing Intided to that great Goodness, (that un∣speakable and eternal Felicity) which he hath laid up for them that fear him, and trust in him before the Sons of men — Diligently to
<PB N="7" REF="005295_0009_1016F4674A90F8A8"/>search and study the holy Scriptures, in order to know what we are to believe concerning God and what duties he requires fo us, — To believe and medicate on the Being, Attributes and Perfections of the Deity, — To believe that God is, and that he is (thro Christ) a Rewarder of them that diligently seek and faithsully serve Him, — To realize our natu∣rally sinful and guilly State, the Depravity, Corruption and Impotency of our fallen Na∣ture, and the great Guilt we have contracted by our multiplied acts of Rebession against the Divine M jesty. — To turn from Sin to God by Faith in Jesus Christ — To make choice of Him &amp; delight in Him as the chief Object of happiness and as our <HI>Summun <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o∣num</HI> — To see to it that our Hearts be right with God and steadfast in his Covenant, con∣form'd and obedient to his Preceptive and Re∣sign'd to his Providential Will, — To Love, Honour, Admire, Worship, Reverence and A∣dore Him, — To be Thankful to Him and bless his Name for all his Benefits, — To Pray and make Supplications to Him Sanctity his Day, wait on him in all his Sacred insthu∣tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a word, To be as becometh the Gospel both in the temper of our Mind and in the tenour of our Life and practical Conver∣sation. — Our rightly fearing of the Lord implies thus much. We find the same phrase
<PB N="8" REF="005295_0010_1016F46B80CDDB38"/>frequently used in Scripture, importing a se∣rious and firm Belief, and conscientious Ob∣servance of all that God in his Word teacher us &amp; requires of us. And this Royal preacher in particular thus Expounds himself, Eccl. 12. 13 <HI>Fear God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for this is the whole of man:</HI> His whole duty and interest.</P>
<P><HI>Blessed of God and happy then are all they that fear Him and hope in his Mercy, whose Mercy is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commandments. The fear of the Lord tendeth to Life, and he that hath it shall abide satisfied. The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his Convenant. Surely his Salvation is nigh them that fear him, and as the Heaven is high above the Earth, so great is his Mercy toward them. He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great: He will fulfill their desire, He also will hear their Cry and will save them.</HI></P>
<P>But I pass on,</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider the Importance of the next Head of advice contain'd in the Text, or to shew what it is to <HI>fear the King.</HI> The term King is undoubtedly here figurately and sy∣necdochically put for all that are in civil Au∣thority, whom we are frequently in Scripture commanded to Fear, Honour, Obey and be in
<PB N="9" REF="005295_0011_1016F46E2E92ED88"/>all dutiful Subjection unto. And as fearing the Lord imports universal Piety; so by fear∣ing the King, we may understand <HI>universal Loyalty,</HI> i e all the Duties we owe to civil Rulers as such: Not only the King who is Supream, but all who are in Subordinate Au∣thority have a right to what is couch'd and in∣tended in this expression See 1 Pet 2 12, 14 <HI>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man, for the Lord's sake; whether it be to the King as Su∣pream, or unto Governours, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This commandment in our text is exceeding broad and comprehensive: And would we obey it in the full Latitude and Extent of it, <HI>Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions and giving of Thanks must be made by us for Kings, and for all that are in Authority,</HI> 1 Tim. 2 1, 2.</P>
<P>Moreover, We must pay all due Respect &amp; civil Honours to men of this character, accord∣ing to their dignity and worth; So St <HI>Peter</HI> expounds our Text, 1 Pet. 2.17. <HI>Fear GOD, Honour the King.</HI> Compare this with Rom. 13.7. <HI>Render to all their dues, Custom to whom Custom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Ho∣nour.</HI> We should beware that we our selves do in no wise slight, despise or cast contempt upon their Persons or Authority; and do all we can to prevent this in others, — And that their Honour may be upheld and their Persons had in Reverence of all, — That none may
<PB N="10" REF="005295_0012_1016F46FB523AB10"/>disregard and trample on their Authority, vilify their Government, or lay their Honour in the dust. We are bound and obliged by all the Laws of God respecting our duty to∣wards them, to yield a chearful Obdience to all their good and wholsom Laws. <HI>Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft.</HI> Before men adven∣ture to transgress humane Laws, they had need be sure that that Text will bear 'em out in so doing. Act. 4.19 <HI>Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, Judge ye.</HI> — A Text frequently mis∣applyd, wrested, perverted and misimprov'd, especially <HI>at this Day.</HI></P>
<P>We must be able to make it evident from the lively Oracles, that Mischief is fram'd and that Iniquity is establish'd by a Law, be∣fore we may venture to act Counter there∣unto.</P>
<P>They certainly run a dreadful risque and do it at their utmost peril, who disobey and trample on such Laws of Men, as are not re∣pugnant but consonant to the Divine Law. See Rom. 13.1, 2. <HI>Let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers; for the Powers that be are ordained of God: Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation. Where∣fore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005295_0013_1016F4716DB9C3C8"/>
The Enacting human Laws &amp; civil Statutes for the Punishment of evil doers and the En∣couragement of them that do well; the main∣taining and promoting Peace and good Order, the protection of the Church and furthering of the Common-weal, the suppressing all Disor∣ders, frowning away Seducers, and preventing the prevailing and spreading of dangerous Er∣rors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is one (and none of the least) of those ways wherein they that are invested with Legislative Power and Authority are the Ministers of God unto their People for good: And it is a despising the Divine goodness here∣in; a contemning and dishonouring our Poli∣tical Fathers, and a shameful violation of the fifth Commandment for any to disregard, go a∣brest to or counter-act such Laws.</P>
<P>Further, We are bound in all proper ways and methods, to express our gratitude and thankfulness not only to God, but likewise to these wise and good Patriots; these Patrons of our Civil and Religious Enjoyments, Liberties, Rights and Privileges; for all the Quietness we injoy by their Providence, — To testify our Fidelity to them; to stand by 'em, to stand up for them and endeavour to Encourage their Hearts and strengthen their Hands; and not imagine Mischief against them, nor consult to cast them down from their Excellency. See Ezra, 10.4. <HI>Arise, for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005295_0014_1016F474313B4968"/>
Further still, These publick Labourers are worthy of their Hire, <HI>Rom</HI> 13.7. The dignity of their Post their publick Trust and extensive Usefulness demands an answerable, that is, an honourable Reward. And the withholding more than is meet in this case is a burning shame, a high disgrace and reproach to any People, — It argues them to be of a narrow, contracted, stingy, sordid and ungrateful spirit and temper of mind.— And such Parsimony for ever tendeth to poverty.</P>
<P N="3">III. We come now to consider the last and Cautionary Branch or part of the Text,— <HI>And meddle not with them that are given to Change.</HI></P>
<P>And here I shall endeavour of shew,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Who or what manner of Persons these are.</HI> And.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>That these are not to be meddl'd with.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To begin with the first.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to draw the ugly, mishapen and forlorn Picture of them that are given to Change.</P>
<P>And this must be done in <HI>Miniaeture:</HI> For it would be endless to trace them in their almost infinite mutations, mazes, meanders, intricate turnings &amp; windings, in all their Excentrick, Progressive and Retrograde, Apogee and Perigee motions.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005295_0015_1016F47A6D0A9420"/>
But to come to the Point and to the Case in hand.</P>
<P>They that are given to Change, are men that (being under the direction, influence &amp; government of no fix'd steady Principles) are frequently altering their Mind, shifting and changing their Opinion, and in consequence hereof their Practice and Conduct, not for the better but for the worse</P>
<P>There is a good as well as a bad Change: A Change which all of us are, or must be the Subjects of as ever we hope to be happy, <HI>viz.</HI> That which St Paul speaks of; 2 Cor. 3.18 <HI>We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are chang'd into the same Image from glory to glory, oven as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> There is such a thing as a man's chan∣ging from bad to good, and from good to bet∣ter, which cannot be condemned. If men have imbib'd unsound Principles, embrac'd Errors and espous'd false Maxims and acted upon them; 'tis fit they should change their Sentiments and alter their Course of acting — 'Tis strictly Just, 'tis Honorary to our Profes∣sion as Christians, and our Glory as Men to Embrece Truth when ever it offers it self to our Choice: 'Tis highly commendable for any when they find themselves in an Error, whether in Opinion or Practice, speedily to renounce, relinquish and abandon the same:
<PB N="14" REF="005295_0016_1016F47BF5097FD8"/>To exchange falshood for truth, darkness for light, and bitter things for sweet. 'Tis praise∣worthy to do all we can to rectify our Mistakes and false Judgments of things, and to turn from crooked and perverse Ways into such as are right and strait, and the paths of Peace,</P>
<P>But this (I conceive) is not the Change here intended. No but a changing from good to bad, or from better to worse; a changing true Maxims and Opinions for false ones: turning away from the truth and turning unto fables, and turning from the right ways of the Lord to commit works with the workers of Iniquity.</P>
<P>Changlings there are of this sort too too many. There are, who love and use Changes, and are so addicted hereunot, that they are here said <HI>to be given to Change;</HI> even as one that inordinately loves and follows strong Drink is said to be given to it, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.8.</P>
<P>Some there are who are Unstable in all their ways, in their obedience to God, and to the King, and are prone to Rebellion against both. They Change their mind &amp; manners al∣most as often as the <HI>Camaleon</HI> is said to change his Colour: Are as changeable as the Wea∣ther &amp; variable as the Wind: Meer Weather-Cocks — Constant in nothing, save only in Inconstancy.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="005295_0017_1016F47D800D0FC0"/>
(1) <HI>They are given to change in matters of Re∣ligion.</HI> They seem always as tho' they had their Religion to chuse, in regard they are never fix'd in any thing; but are for ever wa∣vering like a wave of the Sea, driven to and fro and carried about with diverse &amp; strange Doctrines. One while these are allow'd to be sound Doctrines; anon, these are condemn'd and discharged. One while these are good Preachers, orthodox and sound in the Faith; presently, these are deserted and stigmatiz'd by them as <HI>Hereticks, Legalists, Letter-learned Pharisees, Soul-daubers, &amp;c.</HI> And others set up Caress'd and Canoniz'd, even such as come from the Ends of the Earth, and for ought they Know may be <HI>Missionaries from the Pontifi∣cate of Rome (For these that have turned the World upside down, are come hither allo,</HI> whom some have receiv'd —) Which (by the way) can be no Mark of their being Christ's Sheep: Joh. 10 5. <HI>And a Stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of Strangers.</HI> Compare this with Chapt. 5.43 <HI>I am come in my Father's Name, and ye re∣ceive Me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</HI></P>
<P>One while these are some of the best of Books; after a while these are rejected, are nigh unto Cursing and their End is to be <HI>Burned.</HI> Nor can the departed Spirits of their
<PB N="16" REF="005295_0018_1016F481AD6D3A08"/>Authors be found (by the Extensive Charity of these right Catholick men) any where but in the devouring Flames of Hell: and because (as they think the Smoke of their Torment will ascend up for ever and ever, they can sing Hallelujahs ou this Joyful Occasion: <HI>So Pityful, Tender-hearted and full of Compassion are these dear Children and distinguish'd Saints.</HI> —</P>
<P>One while this is the best and the only true Form of Worship &amp; Church-Discipline; the only likely Method to promote Religion, to further Awakenings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By &amp; by this Scheme is dislik'd, cry'd down, laid aside and superseded by another that is bran-new. Thus moveable are their ways that you cannot know them. Perhaps a Hare does not oftener alter her course, interchange ground, turn short about, wind &amp; twist, than some of these change their Faith and Practice. They are like Children tossed to &amp; fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, and led aside by the cunning Craftiness of them that lie in wait to deceive. Like a silly Dove wandring from Mountain to Valley, seeking rest but finding none to their unsettled &amp; wavering Minds. Like Ephraim of old <HI>feeding on the wind, and following after the East wind.</HI> Their goodness is as a morning Cloud and early Dew, it goeth away, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.4.</P>
<P>This is to be <HI>given</HI> to Change. —</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005295_0019_1016F4846352A210"/>
So those men that wickedly forsake God &amp; break his Laws, are said to <HI>change their God, Jer.</HI> 2 11 And to change GOD's Judgments &amp; Ordinances Isa. 24 5 <HI>The Earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the Laws, changed the Ordinances and broken the everlasting Covenant.</HI> See also <HI>Ezek.</HI> 5 5, 6. — So they did in the Prophet Elijah's day, <HI>The children of Israel</HI> (says he) <HI>have forsaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars and slaem thy Prophets with the sword.</HI> So in the time of the Prophet Hosea; <HI>My people</HI> (says he) <HI>ask Counsel at their Stocks, and their Staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of Whoridom, hath caused them to Err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God:</HI> They Sacrifice (not in the Place that God had chosen and appointed for this purpose) No, but upon the tops of the Mountains, and burn Incense upon the Hills, under Oaks and Poplars and Elms, because the shadow thereof is good Their Prophets pro∣phesy'd Lies in God's Name, and the People lov'd to have in so. See Chap 9 7, 8. <HI>The pro∣phet is a sool, the spiritual man is mad; a snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his God.</HI> And in Ezekiel's time what Abomi∣nations were committed, not only by Others, but by some of the Ancients of the house of <HI>Israel</HI> in the dark, in the Chambers of their Imagery; which the Prophet saw in Vision,
<PB N="18" REF="005295_0020_1016F485E9D49A58"/><HI>Ezek.</HI> 8.11. And in the time of the last Prophet, how shamefully did they despise and forsake God's Ordinances, prophane his Day, <HI>&amp;c.? The Table of the Lord was polluted by them,— They Vow'd and then Sacrified unto the Lord a Corrupt thing. — The Table of the Lord is Contemptible.</HI> (This was their Language) They <HI>said, What a weariness is it? And they snuffed at it.</HI> See a black Bill of Indictment summarily drawn up &amp; exhibited against them by God Himself, Mal. 3.7. <HI>Even from the days of your Fathers ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, and have not kept them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did they gad about to change their way; like a common Prostitute whose Love is never fix'd, but somtimes set on this, somtimes on that Paramour; playing the Harlot with many Lovers. And are there none at the <HI>present Day</HI> who might here behold their Face &amp; pro∣per Features as in a Glass?</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>This sort of Men are likewise given to Change with reference to Civil Affairs.</HI> In consequence of this <HI>Vertigo,</HI> or dizziness in the Head, this in∣stability, fickleness &amp; variation in Opinion and Judgment, they are ever &amp; anon for change of Government, and thence are raising a Dust, making a Bustle, and endeavouring to Over∣set the Government; to turn things <HI>topsy turvy</HI> and bring all into Confusion. —</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005295_0021_1016F48780134598"/>
One while they are for this Model &amp; Form of civil Government, another while for that, &amp; oftner for none at all. Those men they esteem the best Qualified for Rulers (and accordingly will Vote for them) who are most like them∣selves, viz. <HI>given to Change:</HI> well knowing that such are most likely to abett &amp; encourage, or at least to connive at their Fluctuating &amp; ex∣travagant Principles &amp; Practises. Not the up∣right &amp; steadfast Oak, but the bending cring∣ing Willow is the Tree which they chuse should Rule over them. Wise men and un∣derstanding and known, <HI>i e.</HI> approv'd among our Tribes, known to be strong Rods and fast Friends to the Government; Men who have for many Years Ruld us in the Integrity of their Hearts and by the Skilfuness of their Hands, these must by all means be laid aside, turn'd out, and Changlings set up — Thus using their Liberty for a cloak of Maliciousness and not as the Servants of God.</P>
<P>We have a flagrant Instance of this being given to Change, with regard to State affairs, in the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> their being so set for a new Form of Government, even, while good old <HI>Samuel</HI> their chief Judge was yet living: And that notwithstanding they were Adver∣tised what the bad Consequence of such a Change as they insisted on would be, what would be the manner of their King, — how
<PB N="20" REF="005295_0022_1016F48C91E60BE8"/>he would Monopolize their Estates, make Slaves of their Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This notwithstanding, they were, it seems for Monarchical and not Aristocratical Government, for Kings rather than Judges. This thing, 'tis said displeased the Lord: Wherefore <HI>He gave them a King in his anger and took him away in his wrath</HI> Which was written for our admonition. <HI>Faelex quem faciunt alienae pericula Cautum,</HI> —</P>
<P>Lo, these are a part of their ways.</P>
<P>But I must pass on,</P>
<P N="2">2. To shew, <HI>That these men are not to be med∣dled with.</HI> To make way for which, it may not be amiss of we take some brief Notice of what is implied in this Caution, — <HI>And meddle not with them that are give to Change.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Original, it is, <HI>Mix not thy self with them, —" i. e.</HI> Either in their Coun∣sels "and Practises, or in familiar Conversa∣tion." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Pool</HI> in locum.</NOTE> But there is moreover a Miosis in the words, more imply'd &amp; intended than is express'd. 'Tis not enough that we mix not our selves with them in their Counsels and Practises, but we must use all lawful Methods and Endeavours that the Counsel of these <HI>A∣hithophels,</HI> these Changlings, may be turned in∣to Foolishness, that their Devices may be dis∣appointed;
<PB N="21" REF="005295_0023_1016F48F537C72F8"/>that they may be taken in their own Craftiness, that their Counsel may be car∣ried headlong, and that their hands may not perform their Enterprise.</P>
<P>When we plainly see them attempting to introduce a Change, whether in Church or State, or both; a Change which is likely to be subversive of and destructive to our most dear and valuable Interests: When we hear them say one to another, <HI>Rase it, rase it, even to the Foundation thereof!</HI> Does it not concern us to Counter-act them, and do what we can to pre∣vent the growing &amp; important Mischief?</P>
<P>When they that are given to Change, are opening a wide and perillous Door for the let∣ting in of <HI>Enthusiastical Impulses, Trances, Visions &amp; Revelation, Antinomian &amp; Familistical Heresy,</HI> and the like; and what loudly threatens a Sub∣version to all the peaceable Order in a Govern∣ment, and when the most barefac'd Contempt is cast upon Authority both Civil &amp; Ecclesi∣astical; in this case Neutrality seems hardly sufficient. Eph 5.10. <HI>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of Darkness, but rather reprove them.</HI> 'Tis doubtless best that such <HI>Grapes of Sodom &amp; Clusters of Gomorrha</HI> be nipp'd in the Bud, that the <HI>Cockatrice</HI> be crush'd in the Egg. The way to do which (one would think) is not to sit still and do nothing: Prov. 22.3
<PB N="22" REF="005295_0024_1016F490D83C3558"/><HI>A prudent man foreseeth the Evil and hideth him∣self; but the simple pass on and are punished.</HI></P>
<P>Proceed we now to make it our, that men given to Change are not to be meddled with. And this may appear in the light of these following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The meddling with men of this Character is expresly Forbidden by the Holy Ghost in this and implicitly in sundry other Texts of Scripture: Particularly where we are Cau∣tion'd not to be <HI>Partakers of other mens Sins; To withdraw from them that walk Disorderly; To mark them that cause Divisions and avoid them.</HI>—</P>
<P N="2">2. Their being oppos'd in the Text to such as Fear GOD and the King, plainly intimates that they are men of no Religion, men void of Piety and Loyalty; and therefore they are not to be meddl'd with.</P>
<P>The mixing our selves with them in com∣mon Coversation, but especially in their Coun∣sels, is unprofitable, yea, 'tis hurtful: <HI>For their Heart studieth Destruction and their Lips talk of Mischief,</HI> Prov. 24.2. Hence Job could say, Chap. 21.16. <HI>The Counsel of the wicked is far from me.</HI> He that walketh with the wise shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be de∣stroyed. And persons that Fear not GOD neither regard men cloath'd with Authority,
<PB N="23" REF="005295_0025_1016F4938B03C360"/>must needs be unqualify'd and unfit to sustain any publick Post either in the Church or in the State. <HI>Shall even he that hateth right, govern?</HI> Job 34.17. So that they are to be let alone and not meddl'd with in this respect. If they that are given to Change are men that fear not GOD nor the King, what profit can we expect to reap from intermeddling or mixing our selves with them in their Counsels and Practises?</P>
<P><HI>O may Soul, come not thou into their Secret!</HI> It was David'<HI>s</HI> honour and happiness that he could Appeal to Almighty GOD and profess, <HI>I am a Companion of all them that fear Thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts.</HI> And again, <HI>I have not sat with Vain Persons, neither will I go in with Dissemblers: I hate the congregation of Evil doers and will not sit with the Wicked.</HI> So Jeremiah, Chap. 15.17. <HI>I sat not in the Assembly of the Mockers, nor rejoiced.— Blessed is the man that walketh not in the Counsel of the Ʋngodly, nor standeth in the way of Sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the Scornful. The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit,</HI> Prov. 12.5.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we view them in that light (or rather in that darkness) wherein they have been plac'd in the foregoing Discourse, we shall see sufficient Reason to steer clear of, and have nothing to do with these men, —</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005295_0026_1016F497812C6658"/>
'Tis true, these are in their own Opinion, the only Lights of the World, burning and shining Lights: But as the Moon is known to be an Opake Body, void of innate Light, by its frequent Lunations &amp; Changes; so their being given to Change, is Evidential that the Light which is in them is Darkness, yea, 'tis Darkness that may be felt: 1 Joh 2 9 <HI>He that saith he is in the Light and hateth his Brother, is in Darkness even until now. He walketh in Dark∣ness &amp; knoweth not whither he goeth, because Dark∣ness hath blinded his Eyes.</HI> Those that are Un∣stable as water don't Excell: No, but render themselves many ways mean &amp; contemptible &amp; very unfit for publick Trust &amp; Improvement. There is no trust to be put in them, there is no depending upon them. Considence in such men is like <HI>a broken tooth &amp; a foot out of joint,</HI> Pr 25.19</P>
<P N="4">4. The meddling with &amp; preferring such men to places of publick Trust &amp; Improvement, is like to be of very pernicious Consequence, and tends greatly to hurt the Publick. <HI>When the Righteous are in Authority the people rejoice; but when the Wicked beareth Rule the people mourn. As a roaring Lion and a ranging Bear, so is a wicked Ruler over the poor People. They that work Wickedness must not be set up,</HI> Mal. 3.15. When Vile men are exalted they have it more in their Power to injure the Publick, — And they seldom want a Will.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="005295_0027_1016F49A35DD17D0"/>
So what a Tumult and Rout was caus'd in the State by Absalom (a Seditious Villain) and those that Tagg'd after him? Some of whom had little Wit, and others as little Ho∣nesty: For of some 'tis said, <HI>That when called they went in their simplicity and knew not any thing,</HI> l. e. of Absalom's wicked &amp; rebellious design. But this some wre well appriz'd of, particu∣larly the Spies or such as rid Post, whom he sent throughout all the Tribes of Israel, saying, <HI>As soon as you hear the sound of the Trumpet, then ye shall say Absalom Reigneth in Hebron.</HI></P>
<P>Again, What an ill-boding Change was made in the Republick by another ambitious Top and aspiring Cox omb, together with that disaffected and designing Crew of chang∣lings with whom he conferred, consulted and consorted, and <HI>who following Adonijah helped him?</HI></P>
<P>I might further Instance in Jeroboam, (one mightily given to Change, especially when 'twould serve his own ambitious and avititious Ends &amp; Designs) who first made a change in Civil, and then soon introduc'd one in Sacred and Ecclesiastical affairs; whose Name is left on sacred Record with this brand of Infamy fix'd upon it, to his immortal Dishonour, — <HI>Jeroboam the son the Nebat, who made Israel to sin.</HI></P>
<P>But what shall more say? For the Time would fail me to speak of the great and mani∣fold
<PB N="26" REF="005295_0028_1016F49BC0B751B0"/>Disturbances, Disorders, Convulsions and Confusions both in Church &amp; State, and the infinite Mischiefs which have been fomented and brought forward by men of this make &amp; character; especially when they have been promoted to Honour, had the plaudit of the Populace, and have been hail'd &amp; even hosan∣na'd by the giddy Multitude of unthinking Mortals.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another Reason wherefore we shou'd not meddle or mix our selves with them that are given to Change, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because the more such Changlings there are, the <HI>greater</HI> Mischief they are capable of perpetrating &amp; pushing forward, <HI>Vis unita fortior.</HI> 'Tis pity there should be so much as one such belonging to a Community,—<HI>One Sinner deftroys much good,</HI> — But when such are multiplied, under one or more Ring∣leaders &amp; Arch changlings (like the Plague of Locusis or Lice brought upon the Egypti∣ans) they carry all before there, darken a Land and make a most fearful Desolation, (Nor is such a Plague when begun &amp; spread∣ing, like to be stay'd, except Phinchas rife up &amp; execure Judgments.) Like the tail of some baleful, baneful red-hot Comet, they scatter and diffuse their malignant Influences far &amp; wide, kindie a destroying Fire and make a rue∣ful Conflagration wherever they come. And were there enough such Phaetons, they would
<PB N="27" REF="005295_0029_1016F49D4A3D4EB0"/>soon set the whole World on Fire in good earnest, not in iction but in fact.</P>
<P>Very grievous are they when once they get the lead, in so much that were a Land as the garden of Eden before them, behind them it would be a desolate Wilderness, yea and no∣thing could escape them. To allude to that, <HI>Joel</HI> 2.3 Should men of this turn &amp; cast of mind once get the Staff of Government into their hands, we should have Judgment with∣out Mercy; their tender mercies would be cruelty. Where there is no truth there is no mercy to be expected. See <HI>Hos</HI> 41. So Prov. 28.28. <HI>when the wicked rise men hide themselves.</HI> And I wish it never come to this, <HI>That whoso∣ever killeth you, will think he doth God service.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. If we meddle with them &amp; become par∣takers of their Sins, we must expect to receive of their Plagues &amp; Punishment. <HI>Tho' hand join in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished.</HI> The wicked, such are they whose bold trans∣gressions of the Laws of GOD &amp; Man plainly saith, <HI>that there is no fear of God before their eyes.</HI> We are told that a participation or partner∣ship with such in their wickedness, very aw∣fully exposes to divine Vengeance, See <HI>Ps.</HI> 50.17.</P>
<P>The Day is hastning when Christ the Judge will speak unto them in his Wrath and vex them in his sore Displeasure; will break them
<PB N="28" REF="005295_0030_1016F4A251D327F8"/>with a rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces like a Potters vessel: Will say, Bring hither these mine Enemies, who would not that I should Reign over them and stay them before my face: Bind them in bundies &amp; burn them together. Is not destruction to the wicked, (to all such as fear not the LORD &amp; the King) and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? The hypocrite in heart heap up wrach, <HI>Job</HI> 36. 13 The wicked plotteth against the just; the LORD shall laugh at him, for he seeth that his day is coming: Into smoke shall they consume away; the transgressors shall be destroyed together, <HI>Psal.</HI> 37.12, —</P>
<P>How awful to this purpose are those words of St. <HI>Peter?</HI> 2 Pet. 2.1, 2, 3 <HI>But there were false Prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false Teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable Heresies, and bring upon them∣selves swift destruction: And Many shall Follow their Pernicious Ways, by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of: And through Covetousness shall they with seigned words make merchandise of you; whose Judgment now of a long time lingreth not and their Damnation slumbreth not.</HI> And let it be remembred, that he that receiveth such into his house and biddeth him God speed, is partaker of their evil deeds, <HI>John</HI>'s Epist, 2 ver 10, 11.</P>
<P>But I hasten to make some brief <HI>Improvement.</HI></P>
<P>And,
<PB N="29" REF="005295_0031_1016F4A5064D1920"/>1. <HI>It is matter of deep Lamentation that there are so many among us who fear not GOD and the King, but are given to Change.</HI> The bad changes both in Principle &amp; Practise visible in many, and that proximate prepareduess hereunto, which appears in more than a few, may well fill every thoughtful Mind with deep Con∣cern, and constrain us to cry out with the weeping Prophet, <HI>O that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day &amp; night.</HI> Does not this spirit &amp; practise which is so prevalent and rise among us, argue a most lamentable decay (instead of revival) of Religion? And what can be thought of, that is of more hurtful &amp; dangerous Tendency or bodes more ill to the Community? Alas! that there should be such Numbers who have changed their glory for that which doth not profit: Who have left their first love, left off to be wise &amp; to do the godly deed: Whose just character is that, 1 Thes. 2 15. <HI>They please not God, and are contrary to all men.</HI> God planted us a noble Vine; how then are we turned into the degenerate plant of a strange Vine unto him? Be aftonished O ye Heavens at this, and O Earth be horribly afraid and very desolate. For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, — When I remem∣ber I am afraid and trembling raketh hold on my flesh. Would to God, there were not so
<PB N="30" REF="005295_0032_1016F4A68CCB0A28"/>many of these gray Hairs here &amp; there upon us, threatning symptoms of approaching ruin.</P>
<P>Are not these the Horns that have scatter'd our Judah, the Eyes that mock their Fathers, the Vipers that eat through their Mothers bowels? Is not much of the glory departed from our <HI>Israel?</HI> How is our gold become dim, how is our most fine gold changed? And is there no cause (in a sense) to renew that com∣plaint of the <HI>Psalmist?</HI> Ps. 74-2, 8—<HI>Thine Enemies rore in the midst of thy Congregations. They brake down the carved works thereof: They have defiled the dwelling place of thy Name; they have cast fire into thy Sanctuary.</HI> For in truth it is come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there is a stink, and inftead of a girdle there is a rent, and burning instead of beauty, <HI>Isa</HI> 3 24 And I wish they don't advance a step further and revive the <HI>Marian</HI> Fire &amp; Faggot; yes, and at length burn Incense unto other Gods and cause their Children to pass thro' the Fire unto <HI>Moloch.</HI> The God Vulcan having thus far answered them by <HI>Fire,</HI> appears to be nei∣ther Asleep nor in a Journey, but much nigher at hand and more propitious to them than he once was to the Prophets of Baal, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 18 27</P>
<P>I see not but that the Abomination of deso∣lation spoken of by Daniel (in some degree) is now standing in the holy Place, even in these
<PB N="31" REF="005295_0033_1016F4A814E198A8"/><HI>American</HI> goings down of the Sun. Are not the stones of the Sanctuary (in a sense) poured out in the top of every Street, and the precious Sons of our Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they efteem'd as earthen Pitchers? Our Nobles are yet of our selves (Blessed be GOD) and our <HI>Governour</HI> of our own chusing; but are not these (as it were) hang'd up by their hand? and the faces of the Elders are not honoured. Don't the very Child behave him∣self proudly against the Ancient; and the Base against the Honourable?</P>
<P>For my part, I think it's high time to blow the Trumpet in Zion, to sound an Alarm in God's Holy Mountain, and bear the most pub∣lick Testimony &amp; Remonstrance against that horrid and insufferable Contempt that is cast upon Authority both Civil and Ecclesinstical, not a little owing to the wild &amp; over officious Zeal of pragmatical restless Spirits, who like Self-conceited &amp; Rebellious Absalom, are ever wishing, <HI>Oh! That I were made Judge in the Land, that every man that hath any Suit or Cause might come unto me and I would do him Justice:</HI> And to a spirit of Choraism, with which too many are deeply Tinctur'd. These (with but too many others which are the reigning Evils of this <HI>Vnhappy Day,</HI> and which are the Fruits of our being <HI>given to Change</HI>) I can't but be of O∣pinion, have a more gloomy and threatning
<PB N="32" REF="005295_0034_1016F4AD22742508"/>Aspect upon the Land, than should the punish∣ment of the Sword, Famine or Pestilence be sent among us.</P>
<P>The Kings of the Earth and all the Inhabi∣tants of the World would not have believed that the Adversary &amp; the Enemy should have thus entred into the gates of this <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and kindled such a Fire, that it's well if it don't devour the Foundation thereof.</P>
<P>Who ever reads the History of the rise &amp; progress of the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> in the <HI>Sixteenth Century,</HI> may have a taste of the bit∣ter &amp; fatal Fruits of being <HI>given to Change,</HI> and see to what a prodigious Bulk &amp; Size <HI>Enthusi∣asin</HI> &amp; <HI>Fanaticism</HI> may grow.</P>
<P>God forbid that any should imagine that Reformation consists in Changes that tend to the utter Extirpation of Religion &amp; Govern∣ment; in Principles &amp; Practises which want a new Bible to justify them. He that was a Liar from the beginning, and is the grand Au∣thor of Confusion, promoter of Disorder and sower of Discord among Brethren, can have nothing against such Reformation; nor can it make Infidels cry, but laugh and say, <HI>Aha! So we would have it.</HI></P>

We have great reason to Adore the Un∣changeable JEHOVAH, for all the showers of divine Grace and that Righteousness which He has rain'd upon the unworthy People of this Land from time to time: But have cause (I think) to be deeply Humbled for, to Mourn and Lament some of the Changes that have of late been among us, usher'd in by them who professing themselves to be wise <HI>(and are wise above what is written)</HI> have changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped &amp; served the Creature, more than the Creator who is blessed for ever.

<P N="1">1 Not to meddle with them that are given to Change Them, that (if ever they were otherwise) appear <HI>now</HI> to be Back: friends to the Government, and its effectual Adversaries.

Such are they who despise Dominion and are not afraid to speak evil of Dignities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For these St <HI>Peter</HI> compares (and that every Elegantly) to <HI>natural brute Beasts;</HI> Ignorant &amp; Presumptuous are they, Self-willed, Bold, Daring, Stubborn, Refractory, Head∣strong, addicted to their own Ways, and un∣willing to be Rul'd &amp; Govern'd, like a Bullock unaccustomed to the Yoke. —</P>

Now then, <HI>Men &amp; Brethren,</HI> Since we are Intrusted by GOD with <HI>this Opportunity,</HI> to shew our Piety to Him, and express our Loyal∣ty to our King, as well as a just Regard to our Selves, our Families and Friends; let us act Conscientiously, Uprightly and in the Fear of GOD the Searcher of all Hearts, and Vote for them who (as far we can judge) come the nearest the Scripture Qualifications, both in Number and Degree. Let nothing be done through Partiality or a Party-spirit, that may Expose us to that sore Judgment, Isa. 3.4. <HI>And I will give Children to be your Princes, and Babes shall Rule over them; and the People shall be Oppressed every one of another.</HI></P>
<P>Honesty in this case, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> is certainly the best Policy, —</P>
<P>We have lift up our Hand to Heaven, and Sworn by Him that liveth for ever and ever, That we will act in this Affair without Respect of Persons, and as we shall in our Consciences think will be most for GOD's Glory and the Publick Weal. And know it, GOD will not hold them guiltless that take his Name in Vain. That add to their other Crimes, the most hainous, aggravated and dreadful Sin of Perjury.</P>
<P>Wherefore I Counsel thee to keep the King's Commandment, and that in regard of the Oath of GOD. My Son, Fear thou the LORD,
<PB N="40" REF="005295_0042_1016F4C34F129CB0"/>and the King, and meddle nor with them that are given to Change; who, were they in the Administration and at the Head of Affairs, would soon change the Laws &amp; Customs of the Government, not for the better but infinitely for the worse; and cause us all to Roar like Bears and Mourn sore like Doves. Meddle not with a double-minded man, <HI>i. e.</HI> an Hypo∣crite, who is Unstable in all his ways; whose Counsels, Purposes, Actions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are a Med∣ley of Inconsistances. They speak Vanity, <HI>i. e.</HI> Falshood, every one with his Neightbour; with flattering Lips, and with a <HI>double Heart; with an Heart and an Heart</HI> do they speak: <Q>Pre∣tending one heart, and that they speak from a kind and upright heart; when thay really have another, even a cruel &amp; deceitful heart.</Q> See <HI>Psal.</HI> 12.2. They delight in Lies; they bless with their Mouth, but they Curse inwardly, <HI>Psal.</HI> 62.4 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his Covenant. The words of his Mouth were smoother than butter; but War was in his heart: his Words were softer than oyl, yet were they drawn Swords, <HI>Psal.</HI> 55 20, 21. Their Tongue is as an Arrow shot out, it speaketh deceit: One speaketh peaceably to his Neigh∣bour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait, <HI>Jer.</HI> 98. Should we be instigated to Vote sot such, our Answer should be like that of the
<PB N="41" REF="005295_0043_1016F4C609015FC8"/>King of <HI>Israel,</HI> to <HI>Benhadad,</HI> in another case, — <HI>Thu thing I may not do.</HI> What thô the Hypo∣crite be sill'd with his own ways, and <HI>Haman</HI> be hang'd on the Gallows that he had prepar'd for <HI>Mordecai,</HI>— Better so than worse. Bet∣ter some few shou'd die (in this sense) <HI>i. e.</HI> not be Promoted, than that the whole Nation perish.</P>
<P>The same mind, publick Spirit and Love to our Country, should be in us, which was in that Royal Personage the Celebrated Princess of <HI>Persia,</HI> when Petitioning the King to Re∣verse the Letters devised by the <HI>Jews</HI> Enemy, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> destroy the <HI>Jews</HI> which <HI>I endure</HI> (says She) <HI>to see <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>: For how can unto any People, or how can I endure to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>struction of my Kindred?</HI> Esth. 8.6.</P>
<P N="3">III. Finally, <HI>Let all be hence Excited to fear the LORD and the King, and Caution'd against being given to Change.</HI> 'Tis the Criterion or distinguishing Character of a good man, <HI>That his Heart is fix'd;</HI> and that he is steadfaft and immoveable, steadfast in God's Covenant, and does not turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto him. Whereas being <HI>given to Change,</HI> you see, is an indication or Sign of a graceless heart; a Mark of one that fears not God: A dark Character this! And let none of us merit the same. Oh! let us Cry migh∣tily
<PB N="42" REF="005295_0044_1016F4C78F7C5B00"/>unto God Most High (who performeth all things for us) in the language of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psal. 28.3. <HI>Draw me not away with the wiched, and with the workers of iniquity; which speak peace to their Neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.</HI> Let us fear the Lord, trust in Him at all times, and pour out our hearts before him; and we may humbly hope to find that Word made good to us, Psal. 112.4, 8 <HI>Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness, — Surely he shall not be moved for ever, — He shall not be afraid of evel Tidings, his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord; his heart is established, be shall not be afraid until be see his desire upon his enemies.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> profession of our Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; for he that wavereth is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Sea, driven with the wind <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> The wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest: Whose waters cast up mire &amp; dirt. We should hate the work of them that turn aside, <HI>Psal.</HI> 101.3. The works of the flesh which are manifest &amp; are these, — <HI>Hatned, Variance, Emilations, Wrath, Strise, Se∣ditions, Heresies, Gal.</HI> 5.19. This is the will of God, <HI>viz.</HI> that there should be no Schism in the Body, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.3. And by this (says our Seviour) shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another. Let us not then Judge our Brother, or set at noughte our Brother: But let us be kindly affectioned
<PB N="43" REF="005295_0045_1016F4CAA334AE18"/>one towards another, Indeavouring to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</P>
<P>Let us stick fast to God's Testimonies. Some are saying, <HI>Lo, here is Christ or there,</HI> that are not to be believed, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24 23. Let us strictly adhere to the Unchangeable, Invaria∣ble, Unalterable Doctrines, Precepts &amp; Rules of our holy Religion contain'd in the Gospel, and not decline, warp or turn aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left. This is the Way, walk in it. This is an unerring Rule, and as many as walk according to it shall enter into <HI>Peace, Joy,</HI> and <HI>Assurance for ever;</HI> Shall come to the <HI>Heavenly Zion with Songs and ever∣lasting Joy upon their Heads.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis now a day of great Overturnings, and many are given to Change: Many <HI>Deceivers are entered into the World,</HI> who would deceive (if it were possible) the very Elect. But Jesus Christ and his Gospel is the same <HI>Yester∣day, to Day, and for Ever.</HI></P>
<P>Let me therefore urge &amp; press you to Con∣stancy in the true, incorrupt Christian Pro∣fession, in the Faith once deliered to the Saints; the Truth as it is in Jesus; and in the practice of pure and undefiled Religion. <HI>Look to your selves that we lose not those things which we have wrought; but that we receive a full Re∣ward,</HI> Joh, 2 Epist. ver. 8.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="005295_0046_1016F4CCA4164BE8"/>
O let us all covet earnestly these best Gifts, viz. <HI>the Wisdom which is from above, which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle and easie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisie.</HI> And those Fruits of the Spirit, which are <HI>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meek∣ness, Temperance, Righteousness and Truth.</HI> And not say we are delivered to do all those Abo∣minations which are contrary hereunto, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.8. — 11.</P>
<P>'Tis said, <HI>Evil men and Seducers shall wax worse and worse, Deceiving and being Deceived: But continue thou in the Things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom, thou hast learned them,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.13, 14.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>May GOD, ever our GOD Bless us and cause his Face to shine upon us:</HI> And may <HI>the Heads of our Issachar have Ʋnderstanding of the Times,</HI> and all <HI>their Brethren be at their Commandment.</HI> And may we Experience the fulfilment of that precious Promise, Isa 57.18. <HI>I have seen his ways and will heal him; I will lead him also and restore Comforts to him and to his Mourners. Tur us again, O LORD, unto Thee and we shallbe Turned; Renew our Days as of Old AMEN.</HI></P>
