<HEAD>THE MIGHTY DESTROYER DISPLAYED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OBSERVING some years ago the dreadful havock made by the ex∣cessive use of distilled spirituous liquors in this part of the world, I was induced to insert in one of the almanacks an ex∣tract of what had been written on that subject by Dr. Hales, fellow of the Royal Society, containing his own remarks, with the sentiments of several persons of note in the physical way; whose knowledge of the nature of distilled liquors, as well as of their effects on the human frame, best qualified them to give a right judgment thereon. And as the excessive and indeed instaken use of these liquors continues, and rather increases, on this Continent, 'tis thought a republication of those senti∣ments,
<PB N="4" REF="042555_0003_101C75A7CB10A058"/>with some additions, may, thro' divine blessing, be beneficial to many; particularly to some well minded people, who are under mistaken prejudices on this most interesting subject. "My principal and indeed only motive," says this bene∣volent author, <Q>is to endeavour to rouse the caution and indignation of man∣kind, against those mighty destroy∣ers and debasers of the human species, <HI>fermented distilled spirituous liquors;</HI> those worse than infernal spirits, which bewitch and infatuate the nations with their sor∣ceries.</Q> —An evil so amazingly great, that did not woeful experience too fully prove it, it seems incredible, that any whom it concerns could possibly be so neg∣ligent, as not to use their utmost endea∣vours to suppress this destructive <HI>man∣bane.</HI></P>
<P>That eminent physician Dr. Hossman expresly cautions against the use of distil∣led spirituous liquors. "Because," says he, <Q>they are, above all things, most un∣wholesome, being caustic burning spi∣rits; which, by inflaming the solids, and thickening the fluids, cause obstructi∣ons, which bring on many fatal discases, such as hectick fevers, jaundice, dropsies, &amp;c. whereby multitudes are yearly and daily destroyed.</Q> He also
<PB N="5" REF="042555_0004_101C75AA6AF83A98"/>observes, <Q>that they rot the entrails, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the liver, stomach and bowels; as it is evident, not only by opening the hodies of those who are killed by drink∣ing them, but also by what is observed in Germany of the effect which the caustic, fiery, remaining wash of the di∣stillers, has on the guts of hogs; which are thereby so tendered, that they can∣not make puddings with them.</Q>—He farther observes, <Q>That the flesh of such hogs will not keep, even when salted, so well as the flesh of other hogs.</Q> Dr. Cheyne, in his essay of health and long life, says, <Q>All people, who have any re∣gard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the first cravings for such poisonous liquors. The maladies begot by them, bring forth necessity upon ne∣cessity of drams and gills; till, at last, a kind dropsy, nervous convulsion, flux, if not a fever, or phrenzy, sets the poor soul free. It has often raised in me the most melancholly reflections, to see the virtuous and sensible, bound in such chains and fetters, as nothing less than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could release them from.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Short, in his history of mineral waters, page 225. says, <Q>The ofther I reflect on the mischief done by distilled
<PB N="6" REF="042555_0005_101C75AD2A652A28"/>spirits, the more I am confirmed, that the human race had been happier had drams never been known: and I can∣not help cordially joining with Doctor Allen, in his Synopsis Medici, A. 1633. <HI>That the plentiful devouring of those spirits has killed as many thousands of men, as there are stars in the sky. Nay, ten times ten thousands have died by these, more than all the rest of the poisons what∣ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Doctor Lind, in his treatise on the scur∣vy, says, <Q>He observed most destructive distempers to be much increased, even to mortality, by distilled spirituous li∣quors; which sailors are too apt gree∣dily to swallow down.</Q> And Doctor Hales observes, from the remarks made to him by an eminent surgeon, <Q>That the stomachs of great dram-drinkers were contracted into half the common natural size, and hard; somewhat like leather, that had been held to the fire. The consequence of which was, loss of appetite, and a wasting consumption.</Q></P>
<P>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the severity of weather, to which men are sometimes ex∣posed; without which, they say, they should perish with cold; which is proba∣bly, in a great measure, true of those
<PB N="7" REF="042555_0006_101C75AFCB57CB18"/>who are habituated to drink them; the blood of such being thereby so much im∣poverished, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifeless in the midst of summer, without frequent repetitions: this is what some of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are sober per∣sons to endure cold and hardships? their vital heat not being extinguished by in∣temperance, does, by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually secure them from the inclemency of the weather, than the false flash of a dram. Besides, it is well known, that men did not perish in the coldest countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had. Of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hudson's Bay, page 199. Where he observes, <Q>That the natives on the very cold coast, of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to sell distilled spirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robust and active; whereas those of them that are supplied with drams from the English, are a meagre, dwarf∣ish, indolent people, hardly equal to the severity of the country, and subject to many disorders.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="042555_0007_101C75B2693CDAB0"/>
And as to the pernicious effects of spi∣rituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coast of Guinea) it is observed, that the French and Portuguese, who do not indulge in distilled spirits, are healthy compared with the English; who, drink∣ing freely of spirits, &amp;c. die fast. Thus, also, it is observed of the women in the West-Indies, that being sober, they live long; but it is often otherwise with the men, who are more generally intempe∣rate.</P>
<P>The unhappy dram-drinkers are so ab∣solutely bound in slavery to these infernal spirits, that they seem to have lost the power of delivering themselves from this worst of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of those, who have it in their power, to with-hold this destruc∣tive <HI>man-bane,</HI> either as parents, masters, or rulers to the people committed to their trust.</P>
<P>Since then the evil is become so noto∣riously epidemical as to debilitate and de∣stroy multitudes, in most parts of the world; it behoves all, who have any bow∣els of pity for their fellow-creatures, more especially the governors of the nations, as guardians and tender fathers, to guard the people committed to their charge from this <HI>mighty destroyer.</HI> Can there be any
<PB N="9" REF="042555_0008_101C75B62CEEAF80"/>consideration, of sufficient weight, to the contrary. Is it found policy to encourage vice in the people, because a present re∣venue arises from their debaucheries? Where will the revenue be, when the people, who should pay them, are de∣stroyed? Are not a hardy, industrious healthy people, always found to be the most able to contribute amply to the sup∣port of government? And will not tem∣perance, in the end, be found a more ef∣fectual means to increase the real wealth and strength of a nation, than to make drunkenness the cheapest of vices? But if the consideration of the inhumanity of being instrumental to the destruction of multitudes, and in a manner, in some parts of the world, of whole nations, is not of weight enough to influence; yet, sure, the awful consideration, that it must needs be highly displeasing to our merci∣ful Creator, to have his favourite creature man thus debased, disgraced, and destroy∣ed both in body and soul, ought to have its due weight. Can it in reason be ex∣pected, that he will always remain an un∣concerned spectator of of such astonishing proceedings? And will he not in mercy visit the nations for these things, to pre∣vent the still much greater ruin of future generations, in conformity to his usual
<PB N="10" REF="042555_0009_101C75B7B4B36CB0"/>method of proceeding, when irregulari∣ties are arrived to great excesses? This disease has now attained to so enormous a pitch, that it is much to be feared no∣thing less than God's severe fatherly cor∣rection, will effectually cure it in many of the nations; who seem as supine and unconcerned about it, as if only so many thousands of locusts were destroyed there∣by: for if in fifty or sixty years this de∣structive pest has spread thus far and wide, how vastly greater will the havock a∣mongst mankind be in an hundred years more, if some check be not put to its career?</P>
<P>If it had been said, an hundred years ago, to any of the rulers of the nations, that they should patiently, and even un∣concernedly, see such multitudes of their subjects destroyed both body and soul, and that only for filthy lucre; would they not, with indignation, have said as Hazael did to Elisha, 2 Kings viii. 13. <Q><HI>But what is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?</HI></Q> The plain truth is, that it is with the nations as it fre∣quently happens to private persons, that when they grow gradually from bad to worse, they, at the same time, become more and more hardened, so as to be even reconciled to practices for which they had
<PB N="11" REF="042555_0010_101C75BA93FA0F38"/>at first the utmost detestation and abhor∣rence; for familiarity takes away our at∣tention, and robs things of their power to strike strongly upon us.</P>
<P>Though thousands and tens of thou∣sands perish every year by distilled spi∣rituous liquors, yet few appear to lay it effectually of heart, I must here except the heads of the poor wild Indians, of the Six Nations situate back of New-York, and other parts of North-America, who being sensible of the great destruction made a∣mongst them by distilled spirituous li∣quors, have long since, and do still conti∣nue, earnestly to desire, that no such spirit should be sold to their people. At a treaty held at Carlisle in this province, with the deputics of the Six Nations, the Dela∣wares and other western Indians, in the year 1753, Scarrooyady, one of the chiefs of the Six Nations, speaking on behalf of all the Indians present, expressed himself to the following effect, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>The rum ruins us: we beg you would prevent its coming in such quantities, by regu∣lating the traders. We never under∣stood the trade was for whiskey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A spirit made of grain.</NOTE> We desire it may be forbidden, and none
<PB N="12" REF="042555_0011_101C75BD64680D98"/>sold in the Indian country; but that if the Indians will have any, they may go amongst the inhabitants, and deal with them for it. When these whiskey tra∣ders come, they bring thirty or forty cags, puts them down before us, and make us drink, and get all the skins that should go to pay the debts we have contracted, for goods bought of the fair trader; and by these means, we not only ruin ourselves, but them too. These wicked whiskey sellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them sell their very clothes from their backs. In short, if this practice be continued, we must be inevitably ruined. We most earnestly, therefore, beseech you to remedy it.</Q> The Indian speaker gave, as is usual with them in matters of moment, a treble string of wampum, in confirmation of this re∣quest. The destructive effect of distilled spirits, have also extended their baneful influence amongst the people of Africa. It is, in a great measure, through the in∣troduction of those infernal spirits, that the poor negroes have been as it were bewitched, and prevailed upon to capti∣vate their unhappy country people, in or∣der to bring them to the European mar∣ket: hence devaslation, bloodshed and mi∣sery
<PB N="13" REF="042555_0012_101C75C140F29978"/>have spread in their land; many thou∣sands, and hundreds of thousands, have been doomed to a miserable thraldom ; and many, very many, brought to a cru∣el and untimely end: innumerable in∣stances might be mentioned, to confirm this melancholy truth; of which I shall mention two, <HI>viz.</HI> Andrew Brue, the noted French factor, who resided sixteen years in Guinea, tells us, <Q>That, in ge∣neral, brandy is the best commodity amongst the negroes, as they love it to excess: that it is easy, from hence, to estimate the vast profit made by the company, when its store-house is well provided with this liquor.</Q> And Fran∣cis Moor, the English factor, in his ac∣count of Africa, says, <Q>That it was to the king of Barsailly's insatiable thirst for brandy, that his subjects freedom and families were in so precarious a si∣tuation,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is no uncommon thing for habitual rum-drinkers, when a sit of sickness comes on, which they conclude will be their last, to desire to have plenty of rum by them; by which means, they continue intoxi∣cated till death: to so astonishing and de∣plorable a sottish condition have they re∣duced themselves! This is a case so cala∣mitous to mankind, that to have a tho∣rough
<PB N="14" REF="042555_0013_101C75C2CA9C6288"/>sense of it, and yet not to remon∣strate, nor earnestly caution against it, is certainly as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind person of a danger∣ous precipice or pit; yet, alas! how un∣concerned are the greatest part of man∣kind at this most enormous ruin of mul∣titudes! In trials for life, what diligence is used to sind the occasion of the loss of one subject! What care will not a faith∣ful physician bestow for the preservation of one life! How did the wise Romans honour him, who saved the life of one Roman citizen! But in the present case, it is not one, nor one hundred, nor one thousand, but probably no less than a million that peris;h, yearly, by this worst of plagues. How then dare the gover∣nors of nations be unconcerned or silent in a cause in which humanity, virtue, and the real welfare of mankind, both civil and religious, are so deeply concerned? A cause, which tends not only to the weakening the faculties, enervating the bodies of men, but also in debasing the species, and shortening the lives of mul∣titudes.</P>
<P>But the most afflictive and dreadful ef∣fect of the common use of distilled spiritu∣ous liquors, are, that it not only height∣ens the passions of men and depraves their
<PB N="15" REF="042555_0014_101C75C5B3E552F8"/>morals; but what is insinitely worse, and ought to be <HI>an awakening</HI> consideration, they become prophane and abandoned, and to the last degree regardless of their duty to God and man; the feelings of the mind are gradually benumb'd, and an in∣sensibility to the healing insluence of reli∣gion ensues.</P>
<P>The Almighty who has so curiously wrought our wonderful frame out of the dust, knowing how prone we are to dis∣order it by irregularities, hath of his ten∣der fatherly care of us, not only implant∣ed in us a strong desire of life and self-pre∣servation, but has also striclly warned us to avoid all destructive irregularities and vices, and to practise those virtues which are so well adapted to our nature, that they have a direct tendency to give health to the soul, as well as marrow to the bones, Prow. cxi. 8. Yet how is this delicate, this curiously wrought frame, abused and disord red by repeated irre∣gularities of many kinds, but never be∣fore to the enormous degree that it has of late years arrived at by the excessive abuse of these formented, distilled spiritu∣ous liquors, which, by their mischievous effects, seem to claim Satan himself for their author. The benevolent author first men∣tioned from whose collection great part of
<PB N="16" REF="042555_0015_101C75C8508C5018"/>the foregoing is collected, observes, <Q>That if any of his readers should think the subject is overpressed, such are desired to consider that the calamitous urgency of the case absolutely requireth the most pathetical expostulation, to rouse the attention and indignation of mankind, against this greatest of all plagues that ever befel unhappy man, which is both our sin and our most severe punish∣ment.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Cheyne farther observes, <Q>That if only the profligate, the scoundrel, the abandoned run into these excesses, it were as vain to endeavour to reclaim them, as it were to stop a tempest, or calm a storm: But that now the vice is become epidemical, since it has got not only among mechanics and trades∣men, but among perions of the bright∣est, but among perions of the bright∣est genius, the finest taste, and the most accomplished parts. And oh! that I could (adds the doctor) give my con∣science the lye in not mentioning them, even among the first and least fallen part of the creation itself, and those of them too, of the most elegant parts end the strictest virtuc, even of those who are in other respects blameless. Since the case is so, it will not be amiss to shew, to the evidence of a demon∣stration,
<PB N="17" REF="042555_0016_101C75CB00F2C858"/>stration, the folly as well as fruitlest∣ness of such a course. A fit of the colick, or of the vapours; a family misfortune: the death of a child, or of a friend, with the assistance of the nurfe or the next neighbour, often gives rise and becomes the weighty causes of so fatal an effect. A little lowness requires drops, which pass readily down under the notion of physic: Drops beget drams, and drams beget more drams, till they come to be without weight and without measure—did this bewitching poison ac∣tually cure or relieve them from time to time, something might be said to ex∣tenuate the folly and the frenzy of such a course, but on the contrary, it height∣ens and enrages all their symptoms and sufferings ever afterwards, excepting the few moments immediately after taking it down; and every dram be∣gets the necestity of two more to cure the ill effects of the first, and one mi∣nute's indulgence they purchase with many hours of greater pain and mise∣ry, besides making the malady more incurable. Low spiritedness itself is no disease; besides there are remedies that will relieve it so long as there is any oil remaining in the lamp.—Exercise, abstinence and proper evacuations, with
<PB N="18" REF="042555_0017_101C75CDB2554CB8"/>time and patience, will continually make it tolerable; very often they will perfectly cure. The running into drams is giving up the whole at once, for neither laudanum nor arsenick will kill more certainly, altho' more quickly.</Q></P>
<P>The mistaken use and grievous abuse of rum and other distilled spirits, perhaps in no case appear more palpably than at the time of harnest, a business which, under the Mosaic Dispensation, was par∣ticularly enjoined to be carried on with humiliation and thanksgiving, and ought by all means, to be observed as such under the gospel; but through the abuse of spi∣rituous liquors, is made an occasion of a greater abuse of the creature and dishonour of the Creator; this arises, in many, from a mistaken persuasion that hard labour, particularly that of the harvest field, can∣not be carried on without a quantity of rum or other distilied spirits; and in sup∣port of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died in the field through extream heat and fa∣tigue, and it is supposed that many more would die, if a plentiful use of spirituous liquors was not allowed. But this I am persuaded is a great mistake, it being much more likely that the free use of rum occa∣sioned the death of those people; the
<PB N="19" REF="042555_0018_101C75D04FAEE868"/>quantity they had swallowed down, send∣ing a greater flow of spirits into the head than the strength of the body could sup∣port. Indeed the repeated large quantities of rum commonly drank during the whole time of harvest, keeps up the blood in a continual ferment and sever, in which state people cannot have a proper restora∣tive sleep; their constitutions are thereby onervated, their lives shortened, and an unfitness for religious impressions general∣ly prevails.</P>
<P>These most solemn and weighty consi∣derations, have induced some well mind∣ed people to endeavour to lead, by their examples, their friends and neighbours into a contrary practice; and under these attempts, experience has made in manifest, that very little or no strong liquor is ne∣cessary at those times; indeed they have been convinced that the harvest and other laborious work, can be very well manag∣ed without making use of any spirituous liquors at all. If such labour was carried on with steadiness and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a re∣cruit of strength being sought for by that means; more frequent intervals of rest, with a little food, oftener allowed the reapers, and small drinks; such as molas∣ses and water made agreeable with a little
<PB N="20" REF="042555_0019_101C75D4467DE938"/>cyder, small beer, or even milk and wa∣ter, would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's satisfaction and their own advantage; and the over∣plus wages they would receive, instead of the spirituous liquors usually given, might be susticient to purchase bread for their families.</P>
<P>This sober and moderate manner of pro∣ceeding was certainly the general practice in this province, for a considerable num∣ber of years after its first settlement, when but small quantities of strong liquors, and often none at all could be procured <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a printed oration, not long since pronounced by Dr. Rush, before the Philosophical Society of this city, we are told at page 65, <Q>Some of you may remember the time, and your fathers have told those of us who do not, when the diseases of Pennsylvania were as few and as simple as those of the Indians. The food of the inhabitants was then simple; their only drink was water; their appetites were restrained by labour: religion ex∣cluded the influence of sickening passions: private hospitality supplied the want of public hospitals: nature was their only nurse: temperance their principal physician.</Q></NOTE> The people in those early times maintained their health, and were enabled to perform their labour to satisfaction. But this did not long continue, the great call for our pro∣visions
<PB N="21" REF="042555_0020_101C75D5CE1A8CC8"/>brought us into connections with those countries from whence rum was pro∣cured; and the desire of gain has since in a progressive encrease, induced our traders to bring us plenty of distilled spirits, and together with them <HI>diseases and death</HI> in return for our flour, and other useful pro∣duce. So early as the year 1728, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Extract from the Pennsylvania Cazette, for the year 1728. Philadelphia, the 7th of the 41th month, 1728, we have the following surprizing tho' authentick account of rum imported in Penn∣sylvania the last year.</P>

Which, by computation is 224,500 gallons, of which there was exported but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1400 gallons.</P>
<P>So that by a modest computation there <HI>has been</HI> cousumed in one year, at least twenty five thousand pounds in rum. This excessive drinking of rum, as it has slain its thousands, is likely to destroy its ten thousands, for by its corrosive and fiery property, is debauches the stomach, dries up the radical mois∣ture, poisons the juices, inflames the blood; un∣sheaths the bowels, debilitates the nerres and stepi∣fies the brain.</P></NOTE> we find the introduction and consumption of rum had made an amazing progress, and began to rouse the attention of some of the considerate, may I not say, of the lovers of their country in that day. And from the too apparent general use, there is
<PB N="22" REF="042555_0021_101C75D871785A38"/>no room to suppose but that it has gone on in an increased proportion to our numbers; tho' not now so easily ascertained, from the additional numbers of ports, and va∣rious means of procuring it: Nor ought we to omit, in such accounts, the large quantities of whisky and other liquors dis∣tilled amongst ourselves from grain, fruit, and molasses, which cannot well be calcu∣lated.</P>
<P>I have heard of several thoughtful peo∣ple who, from a persuasion that the com∣mon method of giving spirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with those they have employed, not to use any spirituous liquors in their fields; these have had their work performed to good satisfaction, and with∣out any damage ensuing to their labour∣ers. Nay, where they have remained any considerable time with such employers, they have generally acknowledged them∣selves sensible of the benefit arising from having thus totally refrained the use of those liquors. A particular instance of this kind occurred last summer, in the case of Joshua Evans, of Haddonfield; this considerate person being convinced that the use of rum and other spirituous liquors, was extreamly hurtful to the la∣bouring people; more especially during
<PB N="23" REF="042555_0022_101C75DA00D14A20"/>the time of harvest, apprehended it to be his duty, to become an example in oppo∣sition to this pernicious custom; and he concluded to run all risques of loss and da∣mage, which might happen to himself by the delay of bringing in his harvest, ra∣ther than comply with a custom which he apprehended to be so destructive of his fellow <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore offered six-pence per day more than other farmers, to such labour∣ers as were willing to assist in bringing in his harvest, on condition that no spiritu∣ous liquors should be used in his fields. Notwithstanding the singularity of such a proposal, a sufficient number of labour∣ers offered themselves, to whom he re∣marked, That the hurrying manner in which the people drove on their labour in the harvest field, caused an unnatural fer∣ment and heat in their bodies, and of course an excessive thirst ensued, which often occasioned their drinking water, or small liquors, in such immoderate degree as to become hurtful and very dangerous, that this was generally assigned as a per∣son for the use of spirituous liquors: That, in order to avoid these extremes, he proposed to lead them himself in the harvest work, desiring they would go no faster than he did; they acted according∣ly,
<PB N="24" REF="042555_0023_101C75DDC30FA160"/>and his corn was cut down and brought in as well, if not better, than ever it had been before; and tho' the people drank little but water or milk and water, chusing it rather than cyder and water, or small beer, which they were not used to; they went thro' their business with satisfaction to him and themselves. This person has pursued the same course with labourers he has hired for other work; who, tho' ac∣customed to spirituous liquors, after having served him several days, have frankly ac∣knowledged they had done very well <HI>with∣out them,</HI> finding themselves in a better state both of body and mind, than when they began to work for him.</P>
<P>This is a plain instance in contradiction to the common prejudice, that labouring people cannot with safety perform their work without using those liquors. Seve∣ral more examples might be instanced of some considerate people who have made it a rule not to make any use of spirituous liquors, either amongst their workmen in the prosecution of their trades, or on their plantations. To these experience has shewn, that their people could not only do as well without it, but found themselves much better in health, and well satisfied in mind.</P>
<P>Several physicians of eminence have de∣clared themselves in favour of this senti∣ment;

At page 71, of the English edition, he says, <Q>Many imagine that hard labour could not be supported without drinking strong liquors. This, tho' a common, is a very erroneous notion. Men who never tasted strong liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue, but also live much longer than those who use them daily <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The few of these, who notwithstanding their ex∣cess, may have attained to a considerable age, it is most reasonable to suppose, would have lived much longer, had they been temperate.</NOTE> But suppose strong <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did enable a man to do more work, they must nevertheless waste the pow∣ers of life, and of course occasion pre∣mature old age. They keep up a con∣stant fever, which wastes the spirits, heats and inflames the blood, and pre∣disposes the body to numberless diseas∣es.</Q></P>
<P>At page, the same author tells us, <Q>That all intoxicating liquors may be considered as poisons. However dis∣guised,
<PB N="26" REF="042555_0025_101C75E31E86C608"/>that is their real character, and sooner or later they will have their ef∣fect.</Q> It is a prevailing opinion in fa∣vour of drinking spirituous liquors at har∣vest, and other hard labour, that it gives relief by throwing out the sweat. Now, moderate quantities of any small liquor, even water itself, if not drank too cold, and particularly if sweetned with molasses, and a little sour'd with some proper acid, would certainly answer the purpose, with∣out the bad effects which attend the use of spirits.</P>
<P>It is well known that a pint of good mo∣lasses will, in distillation, afford rather more than a pint of good proof rum; therefore must contain as much, if not more real strength than the same quantity of rum, without any of its noxious qualities; be∣ing then in the state the Almighty first formed it, the fiery property so clothed and united with the earthy and balsamick parts, as to cause it to be quite friendly to our nature, and not liable to intoxicate; as the spirit alone will, when separated by distillation from the other parts.</P>
<P>Small beer or water mixed with some of our home made wines; or, as before said, water mixed with a due quantity of molasses, made agreeably acid, to such as chuse it, by mixing it with a due propor∣tion
<PB N="27" REF="042555_0026_101C75E4B12BD460"/>of cyder, or some other acid liquor, or even good vinegar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We find by history, that the Roman soldiers in their long marches, often thro' parching deserts, loaded with heavy armour, used vinegar and water as the most suitable refreshment, they carried with them two vessels, either of tin or leuther, the one filled with water, the other with vinegar. It also appears from scripture, in the case of Ruth, when in the learvest field of Boaz, that it was customary to make use of vinegar, as a suitable refreshment in that la∣bour. Ruth, chap. ii.</P>
<P>I was informed by a person who resided some time with the Indians, that they made a drink with parched corn, which was very agreeable and refresh∣ing. The corn, after being parched, is pounded and sifted, the mealy part mixed in water, with mo∣lasses or sugar, to this some proper acid might be added, which would make it yet more agreeable and wholsome.</P></NOTE>; milk and water, or even water itself, if used with caution, will answer all the purposes of common drink for labouring people.</P>
<P>Amongst the several prejudices in fa∣vour of the mistaken use of spirituous li∣quors, there is none gives it a greater sanction or support, than the prevailing opinion, even with persons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed with water, is the best and safest liquor that can be drank; hence consirming it, that spirit in one form
<PB N="28" REF="042555_0027_101C75E9ABF3BD50"/>or other is necessary. To such who have not been accustomed, and think they can∣not habituate themselves to drink water, there may appear to be some kind of plea in this argument, especially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cyder, or other fermented liquors that are dead, hard, sour, or not properly fermented, which tend to generate air in the bowels, pro∣ducing colicks, &amp;c. But I believe if those persons suffered the weight of the subject, and the consequence of the encourage∣ment they thereby give to the use of these destructive spirits, to take proper place with them, it might suggest the proprie∣ty, if not necessity, of introducing a more salutary practice to themselves and fami∣lies. That pure fluid (water) which the benevolent father of the family of man∣kind points out for general use, is so ana∣logous to the human frame, that except in a very few cases, people might with safety gradually use themselves to it: And as to such well disposed people who still retain a favourable opinion for the use of spirit mixed with water, ought they not, even from love to mankind, to endeavour to refrain from, and example others a∣gainst it, (on account of the prodigious havock made by the use of spirits) agree∣able to the example set us by the Apostle
<PB N="29" REF="042555_0028_101C75EB3913FFE0"/>Paul, Cor. viii. 13. <HI>If meat make my bro∣ther to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to of∣fend;</HI> how much more then ought they to refrain from that which may tend to establish mankind in a practice so general∣ly destructive; more especially when they consider the danger themselves are in, of encreasing the quantity of spirit with their water; as it has been observed, that the use of this mixture is particularly apt, al∣most imperceptibly, to gain upon those who use it; so that many otherwise good and judicious people, have, unwarily to themselves and others, fallen with the common herd, a sacrifice to this mighty devourer. And where water is met with, as is sometimes the case, which is scarce fit to drink; its vain to think to remove the noxious qualities by mixing it with spirit; for tho' bad water may be made more palatable by mixing spirit with it, yet all the bad qualities of the water will remain, to which will only be superadd∣ed the bad qualities of the spirit. There are many ways proposed by which water may be helped without any such additions, as by filtration, thro' porous stones, or thro' an earthen vessel, in the bottom of which there is a quantity of sand, which retains the noxious mixture. Hard water
<PB N="30" REF="042555_0029_101C75EE215A1DD0"/>may be made soft by boiling, or by being exposed to the sun and air. Some propose mixing water, which is impure, with loam; this being well stirred and left to settle, the noxious parts will subside with the loam, and the water may be drawn off clear and sit for use.</P>
<P>Dr. Cheyne in his treatise before men∣tioned, observes, That without all perad∣venture, water is the primitive original beverage; as it is the only simple fluid sit∣ted for diluting, moistening and cooling— the ends of drink, appointed by nature, and happy had it been for the race of man∣kind, it other mixed and artificial liquors had never been invented. <Q>It has been an agreeable appearance to me, says this au∣thor, to observe with what freshness and vigour those who, tho' eating freely of flesh meat, yet drank nothing but this e∣lement, have lived in health, indolence, and chearfulness to a great age. Water alone is sufficient and effectual for all the purposes of human wantin drink. Strong liquors were never designed for common use. They were formerly kept in England, as other medicines are, in apotherearies shops.</Q> Speaking of the effects of wine (a liquor in general much less hurtful than distilled spirits) which he says to have been so much in use at the time he wrote,
<PB N="31" REF="042555_0030_101C75EFAA124F38"/>that the better sort of people scarcely di∣luted their food with any other liquor, he remarks, <Q>That as natural causes will al∣ways produce their proper eslects, their blood was inslamed into gout, stone, and rheumatism, raging fevers, pleuri∣sies, &amp;c. Water is the only dissolvent or menstruum, and the most certain di∣luter of all bodies proper for food.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Short, in his discourse of the inward use of water, speaks much in its commendation. He says, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excel∣lency of water, from the longevity and healthfulness of those who at first had no better liquor, and the health and strength of body and serenity of mind of those who at this day have no other common liquor to drink. Of this the common people amongst the Highlands of Scotland, are a sussicient instance, amongst whom it is no rarity to find persons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy, strong, and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty-six or forty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was informed by a person of credit, from his own observations in Scotland, of the strength and hardiness of the common people there; and of their ability to bear cold and fatigue; tho' the cold is great in winter, and their support in some parts principally, if not wholly when abroad confined to oatmeal and water; he has seen a shepherd laid down to rest on sleep on the mountain, without any shelter, wrapt up in his plaid in cold snowy weather, such as would have froze most other people.</NOTE> The excellency of
<PB N="32" REF="042555_0031_101C75F49E678220"/>water, the doctor says, may be argued from the great success people, otherwise despi∣cable, have attained over other nations, while they remained content with the pro∣duct of nature for drink. Of this the Persian, Grecian, and Roman monarchies are instances. This was also the case of our ancestors, the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, whilst their manners remained simple, and their food and drink such as nature had provided, they encreased to such a degree, that their country not be∣ing able to contain them, they were oblig∣ed to send out swarms of people to seek for settlements in the more southern parts of the world; these gradually settled them∣selves in the different parts of the Roman empire: But since those Northern King∣doms have forsaken the wholsome customs of their forefathers, and habituated them∣selves to the use of strong liquors, they are so enfeebled, and their numbers have so much decreased, that many parts of
<PB N="33" REF="042555_0032_101C75F6261D1480"/>their own country now remain unculti∣vated. The rulers easy under the pecuni∣ary advantages which arise, themselves en∣slaved to the practice of drinking to excess, look without concern on this enormous ruin of multitudes of their fellow men. Thus it is in Russia, where a vast revenue is raised from distilled spirituous liquors, and a multitude of people proportionably large, are destroyed thereby. Again says the doctor, <Q>There is a ridiculous maxim used by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not fit for business—I say it is water only that can endue its drinkers with the strongest bodies and most robust constitutions, where exercise or labour is joined with it, since it best assists the sto∣mach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the smallest particles, that they may better pass the strainers of the body, which separates the nutritious parts of the blood to be applyed to the sides of the vessels, and exercise invigorates the fibres and muscles; whereas the rapid motion of the blood excited by drinking spirituous li∣quors, can not fail of being prejudicial to the body, it will cause the watery parts to dissipate and the remaining grow thick and tough, and the event be obstructions, inflammations, imposthumations, &amp;c.— and tho' strong liquors afford a greater
<PB N="34" REF="042555_0033_101C75F8D7F7ECE0"/>flow of spirit for a short time, yet this is always followed with as much low∣ness of spirit; so that to gain a necessary stock of spirits, the person is obliged to repeat the same force, till he learns a custom of drinking drams. In this we are confirmed, if we consider the great strength and hardiness of poor rusticks in many parts of the world, whose provi∣sions is mostly vegetable food, and their drink water." The doctor adds, "That it often happens that persons of tender, weakly, crazy constitutions, by refrain∣ing strong liquors and accustoming them∣selves to drink water, make shift to spin out many years.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Cadogan, in his treatise on the gout, lately printed in this city, tells us, <Q>That water is the only liquor nature knows of, or has provided for all ani∣mals, and whatsoever nature gives we must depend upon it, is best and safest for us; accordingly we see that when we have committed any excess or mistake of any kind, and suffer for it, 'tis water that relieves. Hence the chief good of bath, spa, and many other me∣dicinal waters, especially to hard drink∣ers. It is that element that dilutes and carries off crudities and indigestions, &amp;c. the mineral virtues they contain may
<PB N="35" REF="042555_0034_101C75FA72D01E20"/>make them tolerable to the stomach in their passage, but do, as I believe, little more in the body, it is the water that cures. Wine was given us as a cordial.</Q></P>
<P>Cheyne says he has known men of weak and tender constitutions, who could nei∣ther eat nor digest upon drinking wine, who, by drinking at meals common water heated, have recovered their appetites and digestion, &amp;c. have thriven and grown plump. Speaking of malt liquors, he gives it as his sentiment, that a weak stomach can as readily, and with less pain, digest pork and pease soup, as Yorkshire or Not∣tingham ale: he adds, That they are of so glutinous a nature as to make excellent bird lime, and when simmered sometime over a gentle fire, make the most sticking, and the best plaster for old strains that can be contrived. Even the small beer that is commonly drank at London, if it be not well boiled, very clear, and of a due age, must be hurtful to persons of weak nerves and slow digestion.</P>
<P>Doctor Buchan tells us, The great quantity of viscid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to render the blood sizy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed obstruc∣tions and inflammations of the lungs. Those who drink ardent spirits or strong
<PB N="36" REF="042555_0035_101C75FF6BC84468"/>wine, do not run less hazard; these li∣quors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender vessels of the lungs in pieces.</P>
<P>Doctor Short, page 33, after describing the many distempers produced by drink∣ing of malt and other fermented liquors, adds, That seeing constitutions differ, it is not to be expected that spirituous li∣quors should produce all the same symp∣toms in one and the same person, yet that all drinkers have several of them; and if they come not to that height, its because they afterwards use great exercise or hard labour, with sometimes thin diluting li∣quors, which prevent their immediate hurting <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Edward Bancroft, in his natural his∣tory of Guiana, which includes the colonies of Suri∣nam, Barbices, &amp;c. writes, That the inhabitants derive no small assistance from the Indians—some of whom reside on almost every plantation.—These In∣dians however, are debauched by luxury and intem∣perance, and their manners but ill agree with those of the Indians who have preserved their natural in∣nocence and simplicity. They are encouraged in their propensity to intemperance by the whites, who freely supply them with rum, thereby to attach them more firmly to their service, which confiderably im∣pairs their health and diminishes their numbers.— Speaking of the diseases incident to the country, he says, These are as numerous as in other countries, where they have been augmented by cookery, with its stimulating, provocative arts, exciting inordinate appetites, by multiplying the variety of dishes, which blended in the stomach, compose such an incongru∣ous medly, that the digestive organs cannot possibly assimilate the pernicious mass to wholesome chyle. Nor has intemperate luxury been confined to this single innovation. <HI>Water,</HI> the natural drink of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kind as of all other animals, is now contaminated by the mixture of pernicious spirits, which have p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>∣ed one of the principal blesings of life. From this source are derived those tribes of diseases which op∣press humanity.</NOTE>.</P>

Its customary, and often necessary in the summer season, particularly in after∣noons, for people who are spent by labour or application, to have recourse to some kind of refreshment. This is generally of two kinds, very different in their nature and effect, <HI>viz.</HI> The one is a mixture of spirituous liquors, as punch, grog, &amp;c. or fermented liquors, as cyder, beer, &amp;c. The other is mild and diluting, such as tea, or coffee, &amp;c. The use of spirituous or fermented liquors, for the reasons already given, are hurtful and dangerous; more especially, as the sorrowful experience of many within knowledge, has taught that there is very great danger of even sober
<PB N="38" REF="042555_0037_101C760398781578"/>people who use them, with what is termed moderation, becoming habituated and gradually encreasing their strength and quantity, till it proves the ruin of them∣selves and families.</P>
<P>This caution can scarcely be too often repeatod, as it has been so frequently the melancholy situation of persons, other wise valuable members of society. But the use of mild diluting drinks, such as cof∣fee, or the several sorts of teas, either of our own produce or those brought from the Indies, may be truly cermed innocent and friendly to our naturcs, and very proper to promote a good perspiration and recruit our spirits when dissipated thro' application or labour. And as the use of these innocent dilutors have not escaped censure, more especially from persons who are attached to the use of spirituous or fermented liquers; it may be agrecable to the reader, to hear the sentiments of doctor Cheyne on the subject. And here it may be well to remark that these ob∣servations were addressed to the people of England, where the heat not being so great as in these parts, those restorative dilutent drinks are not so frequently ne∣cessary. A dish or two of coffee, the doctor says, with a little milk to soften it, in raw or damp weather, or on a wa∣terish
<PB N="39" REF="042555_0038_101C76064E8A36B8"/>and flegmatick stomach, is not on∣ly innocent but a present relief.—Tea <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ddling priced is esteemed the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>, particularly Green, when light and soften∣ed with a little milk, if neither too strong nor too hot, he looks upon as a very pro∣per dilutent, very suitable to cleanse the alimentary passages, and wash of the scorbutick and urinous salts: He also re∣commends tea made of sliced orange or lemon, as one of the best promoters of digestion after a full meal, or when peo∣ple are dry between meals. As to per∣sons of weak and tender perves, who find that upon using of these drinks with free∣dom, or in too great quantity, they fall into lowness and trembling; such ought to use them with moderation and caution.</P>
<P>Again we know, says he, that warm wa∣ter will most of any thing, promote and assist digestion in persons of weak stomachs and tender nerves; by this alone I have seen several such persons recover to a mi∣racle, when cold mineral waters, bitters, cordials, and drams have done rather harm than good.—Tea is but an infusion in water of an innocent plant: Innocent—I says, because we find by its taste, it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

The arguments for its relaxing the coats of the stomach and bow∣els by its heat, are of no force; for unless it be drank much hotter than the blood, it can do no hurt that way.—However, I would advise those who drink tea plenti∣fully, not to drink it much hotter than blood warm, whereby they will receive all its benefits, and be secure against all the harm it can possibly do.</P>
<P>Doctor Engelbertus Kaempfer, physician of the Dutch embassy to the emperor of Japan, in his account of that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, giving a particular account of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, preparation, and use of tea; says, is so common in Japan, that travellers drink scarce any thing else upon the road.—The fresh gathered leaves are dried or roasted
<PB N="41" REF="042555_0040_101C760D5531F2F8"/>over the fire in an iron pan, and when hot, rolled with the palm of the hand on a matt, till they become curled. They have public roasting houses built for this very purpose, and contrived so that every body may bring their leaves to be coasted. The doctor makes no distinction between green and bohea; the only difference from his account, arises from the different time of gathering. The first, gathered whilse the leaves are tender, has the best flavour and is most valuable; the second is less so: the last, gathered when the leaves are full grown is the cheapest. He gives it as his sentiments, from his observations of the effect of tea, that when properly pre∣pared and of a due age, it gently refresh∣es the animal spirits, and wonderfully chears and comforts the mind; it opens obstructions, cleanses the blood, and more particularly removes that tartarous matter which is the efficient cause of gravelly and gouty disternpers. This he says it does so effectually, that he never met with any who was troubled either with the gout or stone, amongst the tea-drinkers of Ja∣pan. He adds that he is wholly of opi∣nion that the use of teas would be attend∣ed with the same success in the like eases, even in Europe, were it not for an here∣diltary disposition, for either of these dis∣tempers derived to some persons from their
<PB N="42" REF="042555_0041_101C761002D37320"/>ancestors; and which is frequently che∣nished and fomented by a too plentiful use of wine, beer, strong liquors and flesh meats. It appears the use of tea meets with opposition in the East countries, as well as amongst ourselves, from those per∣sons whose practice contradicts the use of these kinds of innocent diluting drinks: for the doctor remarks, That in Japan the use of tea is very much cried down by those persons who are lovers of sakii beer, which is there brewed from rice.</P>
<P>All the good qualities ascribed by the above mentioned physicians, to foreign tea, may be as truly applied to teas made of our own country produce, such as sage, balm, burnet, sassafrass, &amp;c. &amp;c. these I am persuaded would answer all, if not more and better purposes than the foreign teas. But I spare to say much on this head at present, lest by discouraging the use of any mild diluting drink, (especially one in such general use, and which simply considered as a diluent, must be acknow∣ledged a good substitute,) any strength should be given to the use of spirituous or fermented liquors in its stead.</P>
<P>We may also make a very good refresh∣ing drink of the nature of coffee; from roasted wheat, barley, rye, or chesnuts, full as agreeable, wholesome, and nourish∣ing, if not much more so than coffee it∣self.</P>

Upon the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be asked, What can be done towards preventing or put∣ting a check to the prodigious havock made by the present use of spirituous li∣quors? To this I shall reply with the re∣spectable author first mentioned. Let such lawmakers, governors, and rulers, who retain any love and pity for their fellow men; let <HI>these</HI> be earnestly requested seri∣ously, and solemnly to consider, whether it is not <HI>their</HI> indispensable duty to use their utmost endeavours, that a stop may be put to this dreadful calamity; let not the apprehension of loss or any present incon∣veniency, deter any from doing their duty in this respect, because there cannot any inconveniencies possibly arise from the re∣dress of this grievance, which deserves to be named with those evils which will be the undoubted consequence of its conti∣nuance. The reasons that have hitherto prevailed to the countenancing of this most destructive practice, ought surely to be re∣jected with scorn and indignation, when the welfare of such vast numbers are so deeply concerned. What multitudes of lives would thereby be saved, and what innumerable outrages, as thest, murder, &amp;c. prevented: To rectify which, were an apparently vain and fruitless attempt, while drunkenness is made the cheapest of all vices. A vice which can no otherwise be
<PB N="44" REF="042555_0043_101C76135B3E6550"/>effectually prevented from raging with its present excessive enormity, and spreading devastation all around, but by laying such high taxes upon distilled spirituous liquors, as well those made amongst us, as those imported from abroad, as will make the drinking it sufficiently expensive to put it out of the reach of so great a number of insatiable drinkers, to use it; at least in its present degree of strength.— <Q>Alas, says he, how astonishing a calamity is this, depraving the morals and shorten∣ing and destroying the lives of such multitudes, probably no less than a mil∣lion yearly all over the world—were but one fourth of this number yearly destroyed by raging pestilence, with what earnest supplications would man∣kind deprecate so terrifying and sore an affliction.</Q> How severe a judgment is it, when God leaves men to be their own scourgers? with how unrelenting and un∣merciful a heart do they execute the most severe punishment upon themselves!— Particulars who view this matter in its full importance, will query, What can an individual or private man do in the case? To these it may be observed, That as po∣pular amendments consist wholly of the actions of individuals, every one who is sincere in his desires, that a remedy may be applied to this mighty evil, must, to
<PB N="45" REF="042555_0044_101C76188D911178"/>the utmost of his power, discourage the encrease of spirituous liquors either by im∣portation, distillation, or otherwise, and not deceive themselves, or rather suffer the God of this world to deceive them by means of the specious pretences common∣ly advanced; such as, That other people will be active in augmenting the quantity if they do not; or, That however people may abuse themselves thro' excess, yet what is deemed a moderate quantity, may lawfully be used; but it may casily be shewn, that these and other arguments commonly advanced, are vain, tho' plau∣sible pretences; that the true motive is the desire of gain: That every new importer and distiller, (and oh that the vender also may bring his situation to the true ba∣lance) becomes a party to the evil; gives fresh strength to the practice, by holding out an additional quantity, and of course making it in some degree cheaper, at least easier for their fellow men to come at, to the destruction of their brethren, children of the same father, and who as christians they profess to love as themselves.</P>
<P>And as for such who, tho' convinced of the impropriety of the practice, yet for fear of not having their labour performed, or for other reasons, cannot prevail upon themselves to refrain giving it to their ser∣vants and labourers, let these at least so
<PB N="46" REF="042555_0045_101C761B31ECDE58"/>weaken and qualify it, as to prevent its immediate destructive effects.</P>
<P>A very eminent physician has given the following direction for the benesit of those who have not wisdom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernicious practice of drinking distilled spirituous li∣quors, <HI>viz.</HI> By degrees to mix water with the spirit; to lessen the quantity every day, and keep to the same quantity of water, till in about the course of a week, nothing of the dram kind be used along with the water. By this means the person will suf∣fer no inconveniency, but reap great be∣nefit upon leaving off drams or spirits, as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the stomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be of service. The appetite always increases in a few days after leaving off drams, unless by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the stomach is destroyed. And when the sto∣mach is thus affected, a cup of carduus, camomile tea, wormwood or centaury every morning fasting and every evening, will be found a good remedy.</P>

<PB N="48" REF="042555_0047_101C761F9647BC40" MS="y"/>surfeit, nor carry it off so safely as water, tho' they seem to give present relief. Cheyne.</P>
<P>Many imagine that hard labour could not be sup∣ported without drinking strong liquors. This tho' a common, is a very erroneous opinion: Men who ne∣ver tasted strong liquors, are not only able to endure more fatigue, but also live much longer than those who use them daily. Buchan.</P>
<P>Every thing that has past the fire, so that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its parts, as in distillation, as far as it possibly can, retains a caustic corrosive and burning quality ever afterwards.</P>
<P>In the continued distilation of spirits, the action of fire is so strong as to reduce them to liquid fire at last; which will of themselves evaporate in visible flames and sumes. Cheyne.</P>
<P>The great quantity of viscid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to ren∣der the blood sizy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed obstructions and inflammations of the lungs, &amp;c. Buchan.</P>
<P>Malt liquors (excepting clear small beer of due age) are extreamly hurtful to tender and studious persons. Cheyne.</P>
<P>There are few great ale drinkers who are not phthisical, nor is that to be wondered at, considering the glutinous and almost indigestible nature of strong ale. Buchan.</P>
<P>Those who drink ardent spirits or strong wines do not run less hazard; these liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender vessels of the lungs in pieces. Buchan.</P>
<P>Doctor Cadogan in his late treatise on the gout, says, He cannot allow him to be strictly temperate; who drinks any wine or strong liquors at all, unless it be medicinally.</P>
