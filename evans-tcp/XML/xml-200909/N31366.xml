<HEAD><HI>A</HI> PROTEST, Presented to the HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY, By the Subscribers, at the Close of the late Debate there, concerning the sending MR. FRANKLIN As an Assistant to our AGENT, at the Court of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E whose Names are hereunto subscribed, do object and <HI>protest</HI> against the Appointment of the Person proposed as an Agent of this Province, for the following reasons.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> Because we believe him to be the Chief Author of the Measures pursued by the late Assembly, which have occasioned such Uneasiness and Destraction among the good People of this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Because we believe his fixed enmity to the Pro∣prietors will preclude all Accommodations of our Disputes with them, even on just and reasonable Terms;—So that for these two Reasons, we are filled with the most affecting Ap∣prehensions, that the Petitions lately transmitted to England, will be made use of to produce a Change of Government, contrary to the Intention of the Petitioners; the greatest part of whom, we are persuaded, only designed thereby to obtain a Compliance with some equitable Demands.—And thus, by such an Appointment, we, and a vast Number of our most worthy Constituents, are deprived of all hopes of ever seeing an End put to the fatal Dissentions of our Country; it be∣ing our firm Opinion, that any further Prosecution of the Measures for a Change of Government at this Time, will lay the Foundations of unceasing Feuds, and all the Miseries of Confusion, among the People we represent, and their Pos∣terity.—This step gives us the more lively Affliction, as it is taken at the very Moment, when we are informed by a Member of this House, that the Governor has assured him of his having received Instructions from the Proprietors, on their hearing of our late Dispute, to give his Assent to the Taxati∣on of their Estates in the same manner that the Estates of o∣ther Persons are to be taxed, and also to confirm, for the Public use, the several <HI>Squares,</HI> formerly claimed by the City; On which Subjects, we make no doubt, the Governor would have sent a Message to the House, if this had been the usual Time of doing Business, and he had not been necessarily ab∣sent to meet the Assembly of the lower Counties.—And therefore we cannot but anxiously regret that, at a Time when the Proprietors have shewn such a Disposition, this House should not endeavour to cultivate the same, and ob∣tain from them every reasonable Demand that can be made on the part of the People, in vigorously insisting on which, we would most earnestly unite with the rest of the House.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> Because the Gentleman proposed, we are informed, is very unfavourably thought of by several of his Majesty's Ministers; and we are humbly of Opinion, that it will be disrespectful to our most Gracious Sovereign, and disadvan∣tageous to ourselves and our constituents, to employ such a Person as an Agent.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> Because the Proposal of the Person mentioned, is so extremely disagreeable to a very great Number of the most serious and reputable inhabitants of this Province of all Denominations and Societies (one Proof of which is, his ha∣ving been rejected, both by this City and County at the last Election, though he had represented the former in Assembly for 14 Years that we are convinced no Measure this House can adopt, will tend so much to inflame the Resentments and im∣bitter the Divisions of the good People of this Province, as his appointment to be our Agent—And we cannot but sin∣cerely lament, that the Peace and Happiness of Pennsylvania should be sacrificed for the Promotion of a Man, who cannot be advanced but by the Convulsions of his Country.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> Because the unnecessary haste with which this House has acted in proceeding to this Appointment (without making a small Adjournment, tho' requested by many Mem∣bers, to consult our Constituents on the Matters to be decided, and) even before their Speaker has been presented to the King's Representative, tho' we are informed that the Gover∣nor will be in Town the Beginning of next Week;—may subject us to the Censures and very heavy Displeasure of our most gracious Sovereign and his Ministers.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> Because the Gentleman propos'd, has heretofore ventured, contrary to an Act of Assembly, to place the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Money here meant was a Sum granted by Parliament as an Indemnification for part of our Expences in the late War, which by Act of Assembly was ordered for its better Secu∣rity to be placed in the Bank.</NOTE> pub∣lic Money in the Stocks, whereby this Province suffered a loss of £.6000; and that Sum, added to £.5000 granted for his Expences, makes the whole Cost of his former Voyage to England, amount to ELEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS; which expensive kind of Agency we do not chuse to imitate, and burden the Public with unnecessary loads of Debt. For these and other Reasons we should think ourselves guilty of betray∣ing the Rights of Pennsylvania, if we should presumptuously commit them to the Discretion of a Man, against whom so many and just Objections present themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> We being extremely desirous to avert the Mis∣chiefs apprehended from the intended Appointment, and as much as in us lies to promote Peace and Unanimity among us and our Constituents, do humbly propose to the House, that if they will agree regularly to appoint any <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fothergill was mentioned by the Subscribers as a pro∣per Person.</NOTE> Gentlemen of Integrity, Abilities, and Knowledge in England, to assist Mr. Jackson as our Agent, under a Restriction not to present the Petitions for a Change of our Government, or any of them, to the King or his Ministers, unless an express Order for that Purpose be hereafter given by the Assembly of this Province; we will not give it any Opposition: But if such an Appointment should be made, we must insist (as we cannot think it a necessary one) that our Constituents, already la∣bouring under heavy Debts, be not burthened with fresh Im∣positions on that Account; and therefore, in Condescension to the Members, who think another Agent necessary, we will concur with them, if they approve of this Proposal, in pay∣ing such Agent at our own Expence.</P>
