<HEAD>The WORD of GOD magni∣fied by Him.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM cxxxviii. 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—For Thou hast magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS is one of <HI>David</HI>'s Psalms of Praise, and it begins magnificently; "<HI>I will praise Thee with my whole Heart, before the Gods will I sing Praise unto Thee.</HI> Whether we <HI>pray</HI> to GOD or <HI>praise</HI> Him, it should be with our <HI>whole Heart;</HI> with the ut∣most Devotion of our Souls, all the Faculties and Powers of them being exerted. An <HI>upright</HI> and <HI>fer∣vent</HI> Heart in Worship, is the <HI>whole</HI> Heart.</P>
<P>"<HI>Before the Gods will I sing Praise unto thee:</HI> Before the <HI>Angels</HI> say some, whose <HI>Presence</HI> in the Place of Worship was then represented by the <HI>Cherubims</HI> over the <HI>Mercy Seat,</HI> and on the <HI>Vail</HI> before it. — But we may rather understand the <HI>King</HI> to mean his <HI>Fellow-Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of the Earth, the neighbouring <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms</HI> round about him; and also the
<PB N="6" REF="004916_0004_100E2D972A86DF10"/>great <HI>Assemblies</HI> and Congregation of the <HI>Nobles</HI> and Judges of <HI>Israel;</HI> of whom we read <HI>Psal.</HI> 82.1, 6. <HI>GOD standeth in the Congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods; I have said ye are Gods, and all of you Children of the MOST HIGH.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>David</HI> wrote to <HI>Hiram</HI> of the Greatness of the <HI>GOD of Israel,</HI> and when <HI>Solomon</HI> shew'd the <HI>Queen of Sheba</HI> how he went up to the House of GOD; then was this Scripture also fulfilled in the very Letter; "<HI>before the Gods will I praise Thee.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Psalmist</HI> goes on, "I will worship toward thy holy <HI>Temple,</HI> and praise thy Name for thy <HI>Loving-kindness</HI> and for thy <HI>Truth.</HI>" The <HI>Temple</HI> was yet to be built, but the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> or Sanctuary was the same Thing to GOD and his Worshippers; and thither they went at the appointed <HI>Times</HI> with the Voice of Praise; or if they were at a Distance, they worshipped <HI>toward</HI> the Place, as <HI>Daniel</HI> did even when it lay in Ruins. <Q><HI>Heaven</HI> is the Holy-place where GOD dwells, and thither we direct our Prayers and look <HI>up;</HI> and CHRIST is our Temple there, and to HIM at the FATHER's <HI>right Hand</HI> we lift up our Souls, and <HI>look</HI> by an Eye of Faith, and our spiritual <HI>Sa∣crifices</HI> are acceptable.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Reason</HI> of Praise follows, "<HI>for thy Loving-kindness and Truth.</HI> These are a special Part of his <HI>Glory</HI> passing before us; "<HI>abundant in Goodness and in Truth.</HI> — By <HI>Truth</HI> is meant the <HI>Promises</HI> that GOD had made and fulfilled to <HI>David;</HI> in the making and performing of which the <HI>Loving-kindness</HI> of GOD was glorious; <HI>freely</HI> made, and all made <HI>good;</HI> all of Grace, Mercy and Truth, which <HI>David</HI> resolves never to for∣get, but ever to give GOD the <HI>Praise</HI> of. GOD had promised him the <HI>Throne,</HI> and had <HI>set</HI> him on it, and now says he — "<HI>Before</HI> the Princes <HI>will I sing Praise to Thee, for thy Loving-kindness and for thy Truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004916_0005_100E2D9C1FBC8300"/>
MY <HI>Text</HI> follows, "<HI>For thou hast magnified thy WORD above all thy Name.</HI> — GOD's NAME is <HI>mag∣nificent</HI> in every glorious <HI>Attribute</HI> and Perfection. He <HI>has</HI> magnified it, and <HI>will</HI> magnify it again. It is <HI>Great</HI> above all the Praises of Men and Angels.</P>
<P>IN a particular Manner GOD has magnified his <HI>Truth,</HI> that blessed and Divine <HI>Perfection;</HI> and it is <HI>exalted</HI> infinitely above all that Men can say or think of it: The <HI>Name</HI> of GOD is <HI>in it;</HI> it is revealed and magnified to us in his <HI>Word:</HI> There especially is the Exhibition of his <HI>Loving-kindness</HI> to the Children of Men. <Q>The <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD to Mankind, <HI>hid in Him</HI> from before the Foundation of the World is his <HI>Loving-kindness;</HI> the <HI>Mercy revealed</HI> to us in his <HI>Word</HI> is his <HI>Truth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN magnificent Manner GOD has made his <HI>Name,</HI> Himself, known to us <Q>in the <HI>Works of Creation and Providence;</HI> but most of all in his <HI>Word:</HI> The Wonders of <HI>Grace</HI> exceed those of <HI>Nature;</HI> the Dis∣coveries by <HI>Revelation</HI> are much greater than those by Reason.</Q></P>
<P>I SHALL speak of the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> of GOD in <HI>general;</HI> taking in the Doctrines, Precepts, Promises, Threatnings, Prophecies and History of <HI>Scripture;</HI> all which is written for our <HI>Learning,</HI> and to make us <HI>wise unto Salvation.</HI> In <HI>all</HI> of them together the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is <HI>magnified.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>magnify</HI> a Thing is to make it <HI>great, famous, illustrious,</HI> and to put <HI>high Honour</HI> on it. So GOD <HI>has magnified the Law and made it honourable.</HI> Isai. 42.21. — I shall here say,</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is <HI>magnificent in it self.</HI> As GOD is excellent, so must his <HI>Word</HI> be. It is the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Picture</HI> of his <HI>Divine Majesty,</HI> drawn by his own <HI>Pencil;</HI> the <HI>Brightness of his own Glory</HI> as far as it can be shown <HI>in Words.</HI> Hence CHRIST, the
<PB N="8" REF="004916_0006_100E2D9F250C2568"/>SON, the <HI>express Image of the Person of the FATAER,</HI> is called — "THE WORD OF GOD.</P>
<P>THE spiritual and <HI>moral Glory</HI> of GOD's <HI>Law</HI> is infinite, eternal, ineffable. All the <HI>Beauties</HI> of Know∣ledge, Wisdom, Holiness, Justice, Goodness and Truth shine in it. We behold in it, as in a <HI>Glass,</HI> the <HI>Glory of the LORD.</HI> Read the magnificent Things spoken of it by the LORD Himself, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. and in the 19, and 119 <HI>Psalms.</HI></P>
<P>IT leads us into the true <HI>Knowledge of GOD</HI> and our <HI>selves;</HI> and of all our <HI>Duty</HI> to Him, our selves and our Neighbours; that we may be <HI>happy</HI> in the Favour and Enjoyment of GOD here and for ever, and in the Love of <HI>Men</HI> and they in us. It <HI>teaches</HI> us how to honour, <HI>worship</HI> and serve GOD with Soul and Body, as becomes his infinite Perfection and Glory; and is also the perfect <HI>Rule</HI> of Righteousness and Charity to Men, in whatsoever <HI>Relation</HI> we stand toward them, or in whatsoever <HI>Condition</HI> we or they are, or may be.— It is the <HI>perfect and royal Law of LOVE;</HI> that <HI>radiant Word</HI> wherein <HI>Light dwelleth.</HI> Whatsoever Things are <HI>pure and lovely,</HI> every <HI>Virtue</HI> and every <HI>Praise,</HI> without any <HI>Darkness</HI> at all, are written (as with a <HI>Sun-beam</HI>) in this most blessed <HI>Word.</HI> Such is the <HI>Magnificence</HI> of the Holy Word.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>supreme</HI> GOD, perfectly adapted for his <HI>Empire over Souls,</HI> their Sanctification and eternal Happiness. <Q>A Word every Way suited to the Souls of <HI>Sinners;</HI> a Doctrine of <HI>Wisdom</HI> adap∣ted to their <HI>Ignorance;</HI> of <HI>Power</HI> adapted to the <HI>obstinate,</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> and Mercy to the <HI>guilty</HI> and mise∣rable. It <HI>commands,</HI> promises and threatens with a Divine <HI>Majesty</HI> and Authority; it <HI>instructs</HI> with a heavenly <HI>Clearness,</HI> and it <HI>persuades</HI> with a Divine <HI>Force and Efficacy.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>EMONGER.</NOTE></Q> This is the true <HI>Grandeur</HI> of the holy Word, the Name of GOD <HI>graven</HI> on it.</P>

II. GOD has <HI>magnified</HI> it in the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Way</HI> wherein He has <HI>given</HI> it to us. The solemn <HI>Enacting,</HI> passing and <HI>Delivery</HI> of the Law puts Grandeur on it. The <HI>GOD of Glory</HI> appear'd to <HI>Moses</HI> at the burning <HI>Bush,</HI> and afterward came down on <HI>Sinai</HI> with Thou∣sands of his <HI>Angels,</HI> and lastly spake to us by the Mouth of <HI>his own Son,</HI> the <HI>Heir</HI> of all Things; who also upon his Ascention pour'd out the HOLY SPIRIT in <HI>cloven Tongues</HI> of Fire on his <HI>Apostles</HI> and chosen Witnesses: And thus GOD has <HI>magnified his Word</HI> to us in the Delivery of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. AT <HI>Sinai,</HI> from the <HI>burning</HI> Mountain, He pro∣claim'd his <HI>fiery Law</HI> in <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> with Sound of <HI>Trumpet,</HI> by the Mouth of his mighty <HI>An∣gels!</HI> How awful a <HI>Descent</HI> of the Great GOD! "<HI>Lo, I come to thee in a thick Cloud, that the People may hear when I speak, and believe thee for ever.</HI> This <HI>oral</HI> De∣livery of the <HI>Law</HI> was to <HI>magnify</HI> it unto the <HI>Children of Israel;</HI> and it did so; <HI>for all the People in the Camp trembled, even MOSES himself exceedingly fear'd and quaked:</HI> For the <HI>Mount</HI> was altogether in a <HI>Smoke,</HI> which ascended like that of a <HI>Furnace,</HI> and the whole Mount <HI>quaked</HI> greatly. It was a Day <HI>never</HI> to be for∣gotten, <HI>ever</HI> to be kept in Mind by them; <HI>Deut.</HI> iv. 32, 33. <Q><HI>Ask</HI> now of the Days that are <HI>past,</HI> since the Day that GOD <HI>created</HI> Man upon the Earth, from the one Side of Heaven to the other, — did ever People <HI>hear</HI> the Voice of GOD speaking out of the midst of <HI>Fire,</HI> and live! Unto <HI>thee</HI> it was shewed that thou mightest know that the LORD he is GOD, there is none else beside Him.</Q></P>
<P>INDEED the <HI>Thing</HI> is too great to be amplified on or <HI>magnified</HI> by any Words of Man! It was a kind of <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> and they that <HI>felt the Terror</HI> of it prayed they might never again see or hear the like. The <HI>Scripture</HI> abounds in the rhetorical and lofty De∣scriptions
<PB N="10" REF="004916_0008_100E2DA6B05C5F00"/>of it;
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxviii. 8. xcvii. 5.</NOTE> <Q>GOD came from <HI>Sinai,</HI> the HOLY ONE from <HI>Mount Seir,</HI> with ten thousand of his Saints; they sat down at his Feet, to receive his Words: The Earth shook, even <HI>Sinai</HI> it self at the Presence of the LORD: His <HI>Thunder</HI> was in the Heavens, his <HI>Lightnings</HI> light'ned the World, the Earth <HI>trembled</HI> and shook, and all the People saw his <HI>Glory,</HI> worship Him all ye <HI>Gods.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. YET <HI>greater Honour</HI> GOD has put on his <HI>Word</HI> in the Days of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> in speaking to us by the Mouth of his <HI>own</HI> SON; <Q>by <HI>whom</HI> he made the <HI>Worlds</HI> (Heb. 1.) who being the <HI>Brightness</HI> of his Glory, and the express <HI>Image</HI> of his Person, and up∣holding all Things by the Word of his Power, when He had by himself purged our Sins, is sat down on the right Hand of the <HI>Majesty</HI> on High; being so much better than the <HI>Angels,</HI> as He hath by <HI>Inheritance</HI> a more excellent <HI>Name</HI> than they; for to which of the <HI>Angels</HI> said GOD at any Time, <HI>Thou</HI> art my SON, this Day I have <HI>begotten</HI> thee! But when he bringeth his <HI>First-begotten</HI> into the World, he saith,
<Q>Let all the <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD wor∣ship Him.</Q></Q></P>
<P>THE SON OF GOD took our Nature, to come and <HI>publish the FATHER's Will</HI> to us: GOD was <HI>manifest in Flesh,</HI> and Men beheld <HI>his Glory,</HI> the Glory as of the "<HI>Only begotten.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> was given by <HI>Moses,</HI> but <HI>Grace</HI> and Truth came by JESUS CHRIST. This is the <HI>Ministration</HI> that exceeds in <HI>Glory.</HI> This <HI>Man</HI> had more Glory than <HI>Moses,</HI> who was but the <HI>Servant,</HI> HE the LORD in his own House. <HI>Moses</HI> wrote of Him, the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> led to Him, and was fulfilled in Him. At <HI>Sinai</HI> GOD promised to raise up <HI>this Prophet,</HI> as a <HI>greater</HI> Thing than all that they had seen
<PB N="11" REF="004916_0009_100E2DAA08597F38"/>or heard there. For which is greater, GOD in a <HI>Cloud,</HI> or on a fiery <HI>Mountain,</HI> speaking in <HI>Thunder;</HI> or GOD in our <HI>Nature,</HI> found in fashion as a <HI>Man,</HI> and speaking to us <HI>Face to Face,</HI> with a Man's Mouth? Which is greater, the <HI>Word spoken by Angels</HI> with the <HI>Trump</HI> of GOD; or by the Mouth of GOD the <HI>Lord</HI> of Angels, in the <HI>Form of a</HI> Servant? He made his <HI>An∣gels</HI> Flames of Fire on <HI>Sinai,</HI> but to the SON it is said, "<HI>Thy Throne, O GOD, is for ever and ever.</HI> If then the Ministration of the <HI>Law,</HI> in the <HI>Terrors</HI> of Death, was glorious, the Ministration of <HI>Life</HI> in the <HI>Gospel</HI> of CHRIST exceeds in Glory.</P>
<P>PASS we then from the <HI>burning</HI> Mountain, and the <HI>quaking</HI> Congregation at the Foot of it, to the <HI>Mount</HI> of Grace whereon JESUS far, and the <HI>Multitude</HI> around him, divinely aw'd, and delighted by his heavenly Voice: <HI>Matth.</HI> v. <Q>And he opened his Mouth and taught them, saying, <HI>Blessed</HI> are the <HI>poor</HI> in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven; blessed are the <HI>meek,</HI> for they shall inherit the Earth; blessed are they that <HI>mourn,</HI> for they shall be comforted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Thus GOD having raised up JESUS, sent him to <HI>bless</HI> and save us. A spiritual Eye sees more Glory in this <HI>Dispensation</HI> of Grace than in all the magnificent Ap∣pearances on <HI>Sinai.</HI> A greater than <HI>Moses</HI> is here. See that ye refuse not <HI>Him</HI> that speaketh! We owe a greater Reverence to this softer Voice of GOD to us, We are not come to the <HI>Mount which burned</HI> with Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to <HI>Zion,</HI> to JESUS <HI>the Mediator</HI> and to the <HI>Blood of sprinkling.</HI> Our Eyes behold the <HI>Desire of all Nations,</HI> and our Ears hear the <HI>Voice from the excel∣lent Glory.</HI> Here all GOD's Glory and <HI>Goodness</HI> is made to pass before us! and here are no <HI>Bounds</HI> about the Mount to keep us <HI>off,</HI> but all the <HI>Force</HI> of Love, and <HI>Charms</HI> of Grace to draw us on.</P>

III. GOD has <HI>magnified</HI> his Word by the <HI>Miracles</HI> with which He has testified unto it. A <HI>Miracle</HI> is some manifest supernatural Effect above the Power of known natural Causes, and beside their known Course and Laws; which therefore must be the Doing of the GOD of Nature, upon some great and special End or Reason. Now it has pleased the <HI>sovereign</HI> and most wise GOD in this Manner often to attest unto the <HI>Re∣velations</HI> of his Mind and Will unto us, and to the <HI>Mission</HI> of inspired Persons with his Messages in their Mouths. This is properly a <HI>Divine Testimony;</HI> and doubtless if GOD has given a <HI>Revelation</HI> to Mankind, it has been attended with such his Testimony. And if the great GOD has <HI>testified</HI> to his Word by <HI>Signs and Wonders,</HI> and Works truly <HI>divine,</HI> we must needs own that he has herein <HI>magnified</HI> and put great Honour on it. It is as a <HI>Sign-manual,</HI> the <HI>Finger</HI> of GOD, his Stamp or <HI>Seal</HI> put to his Word.</P>
<P>THUS the five <HI>Books of Moses</HI> are magnified to the <HI>Church</HI> for ever, <Q>in all the <HI>Signs</HI> which GOD sent him to do in the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and all his Servants and in all his Land; and in all that <HI>mighty Hand and great Terror</HI> also, which he shewed in the Sight of all <HI>Israel;</HI> who when they <HI>saw</HI> the <HI>Miracles</HI> they feared the LORD and believed his Servant. <HI>Exod.</HI> 4.31.</Q></P>
<P>To <HI>magnify</HI> his <HI>Word</HI> it was that GOD divided <Q>the <HI>Sea</HI> before his People, and made the <HI>Waters</HI> to stand as an Heap, while they passed thro' as on dry Land: He also clave the <HI>Rocks</HI> in the Desart, and gave them <HI>Drink</HI> as out of the great Depths: He rained <HI>Flesh</HI> upon them as Dust, and feather'd <HI>Fowl</HI> as the Sand of the Sea.</Q> The <HI>Record</HI> of these Things is magnificent to the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD through all Genera∣tions. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78 and 105.</P>
<P>How was the <HI>Word</HI> of the LORD again magnified, when <HI>Jordan</HI> divided before the <HI>Ark</HI> wherein the <HI>Tables
<PB N="13" REF="004916_0011_100E2DAEAF85C198"/>of the Law</HI> were deposited? And how again when the <HI>Walls of Jericho fell,</HI> blown down by the <HI>Breath of the</HI> LORD<HI>'s Priests,</HI> bearing his Ark before the Con∣gregation? — GOD magnified his Word when he thunder'd on the <HI>Philistines</HI> at the Prayer of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and shut up Heaven and open'd it at the Prayer of <HI>Elijah:</HI> In what Grandeur did that famous <HI>Prophet</HI> say to <HI>Ahab,</HI> "There shall be <HI>no Rain</HI> for three Years to come, but by the <HI>Word of the Lord</HI> in my Mouth? And again in what Grandeur sat he on the <HI>Hill</HI> and said, "If I be a <HI>Man of GOD</HI> let <HI>Fire</HI> come down and consume <HI>thee and thy Fifty!</HI> And yet again, how did the LORD magnify his Word in the Day when he answered <HI>Elijah</HI> by <HI>Fire,</HI> and it consumed not only the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and the Wood, but even the very <HI>Stones</HI> of the Altar, and lick'd up the <HI>Water</HI> that was in the <HI>Trench;</HI> and the People fell on their <HI>Faces</HI> and said, "The LORD He is GOD, the LORD He is GOD.</P>
<P>GOD had once <HI>magnified</HI> his Word in the Mouth of <HI>Joshua,</HI> before the Armies of <HI>Israel</HI> and those also of the <HI>Aliens,</HI> and the <HI>Sun stood still</HI> in the midst of Heaven, and there was no Day like it: Again he magnified it in like Manner to the Sight and Astonish∣ment of all <HI>Babylon,</HI> in the Day when the <HI>Sun went back,</HI> and the <HI>Idol of Babylon</HI> was made to do <HI>Homage</HI> at the Prayer of the reforming King; and the <HI>Idola∣ters</HI> sent with Reverence to <HI>enquire</HI> after the <HI>Sign.</HI> — And when <HI>Judah</HI> was sent into <HI>Babylon</HI> for violating the holy <HI>Word</HI> of their GOD, GOD magnified it <HI>there</HI> by many astonishing Signs and Miracles; as <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Preservation in the Den of <HI>Lions,</HI> and his <HI>Brethren</HI>'s in the fiery <HI>Furnace;</HI> "Of a Truth, said the <HI>King of Babylon,</HI> your GOD is the GOD <HI>of gods,</HI> and the KING <HI>of Kings.</HI> Such is <HI>His Word</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> above <HI>theirs.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when we look into the <HI>holy Gospels,</HI> we find the numerous excelling <HI>Miracles</HI> of our LORD JESUS and the Power which he gave to his <HI>Apostles</HI> to work
<PB N="14" REF="004916_0012_100E2DB1FAD69B58"/>the like in his <HI>Name; Miracles</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> and Com∣passion, Benignity and Bounty.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. X. 1,—8. Joh. xiv. 12, 13. x. 38. Rom. xv. 18, 19.</NOTE> The <HI>Jews</HI> were <HI>con∣vinced,</HI> tho' not converted, by these mighty Works, "If ye believe not <HI>Me,</HI> believe the <HI>Works.</HI> But the <HI>Gentiles were made obedient,</HI> through the mighty <HI>Signs</HI> and Wonders, by the <HI>Power of the</HI> HOLY GHOST; at the <HI>Prayer of Faith,</HI> Acts 4. 29, 30. <HI>And now</HI> LORD, <HI>grant unto thy Servants that with all Boldness they may speak thy Word, by stretching forth thy Hand to heal; and that Signs and Wonders may be done by the Name of thy holy Child</HI> JESUS.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>two grand Miracles</HI> of the Gospel Day, whereby GOD magnified his <HI>Word,</HI> were the <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> of CHRIST from the Dead, and the <HI>cloven Tongues</HI> of Light which sat over the <HI>Disciples</HI> on the Day of <HI>Pentecost;</HI> and they spake all <HI>Languages,</HI> and Men of every <HI>Nation</HI> heard them speak the wondrous Works of GOD in their <HI>own</HI> Tongue. GOD magnified his <HI>Word</HI> that Day unto all the Nations of the Earth, and the Event was <HI>their</HI> Illumination and Conversion. These <HI>Miracles</HI> which GOD has wrought in Honour of his <HI>Word</HI> are indeed <HI>magnificent</HI> Things. — But yet again,</P>
<P N="4">IV. GOD has <HI>magnified his Word</HI> in the <HI>Prophecies</HI> and <HI>Promises</HI> of it, accomplished and <HI>fulfilled</HI> to his People. <HI>This</HI> is that particular thing which my <HI>Text</HI> refers to; GOD had <HI>foretold</HI> and promised to <HI>David</HI> his Advancement to the <HI>Throne of Israel,</HI> when there was no <HI>Prospect</HI> or Appearance of such an Event; but it was gradually, in wondrous Manner <HI>brought about,</HI> in Spite of all the Opposition made against it. Yet this was but a <HI>little</HI> Instance in it self, but in its Conse∣quence vast, in the Kingdom of the MESSIAH, the <HI>Son of David.</HI></P>

TRUTH and FAITHFULNESS is a transcendent Glory of the DEITY. All the <HI>Perfections</HI> of GOD are glorified in this. "GOD maintains the Honour of his <HI>Word</HI> by making it <HI>good</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>How has the LORD made his <HI>Word</HI> illustrious, from the Beginning of the <HI>Bible</HI> to the End of it, in the Fulfilment of that <HI>Great Promise</HI> of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> a <HI>Saviour,</HI> the SEED OF THE WOMAN? The nume∣rous <HI>Prophecies</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> fulfilled in the Per∣son, Life, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection and King∣dom of our LORD JESUS: "HE born of a <HI>Virgin</HI> to break the <HI>Serpent</HI>'s Head! He the <HI>Lamb slain</HI> from the Beginning of the World in all the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> from the Day of <HI>Abel!</HI> He the <HI>Seed of Abraham</HI> in whom all the Families of the Earth are <HI>blessed!</HI> He the <HI>Lion</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Judah! He</HI> the <HI>Shiloh</HI> at whose Coming the <HI>Scepter</HI> should depart! <HI>He</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> whose Throne is for ever and ever! <HI>He</HI> the <HI>King</HI> upon the holy Hill of <HI>Sion,</HI> to whom GOD has said, <Q>Thou art my SON, this Day have I begotten thee; ask of me and I will give thee the <HI>Heathen</HI> for thy Inheri∣tance, and the uttermost Parts of the Earth for thy Possession!</Q> <HI>He</HI> IMMANUEL God <HI>with us,</HI> GOD in our Nature; <Q>to us a <HI>Child</HI> is born, to us a <HI>Son</HI> is given, and the <HI>Government</HI> is laid upon his Shoulder.</Q> <HI>He</HI> the <HI>tender Plant</HI> and Root out of a dry Ground! <HI>He</HI> the <HI>Man of Sorrows</HI> and acqnainted with <HI>Grief! He</HI> of whom <HI>all the Prophets</HI> have spoken!</P>
<P>IN nothing has the LORD more <HI>magnified his Word</HI> than in this <HI>Testimony of Jesus,</HI> which is <HI>the Spirit of Prophecy.</HI></P>
<P>YET are there many other plain and magnificent <HI>Prophecies,</HI> such as <HI>Jacob</HI>'s blessing his Sons, and <HI>Moses</HI> blessing the <HI>Tribes,</HI> the Man of GOD against the Altar at <HI>Bethel;</HI> those concerning the <HI>Captivity</HI> and Return of <HI>Judah,</HI> and of <HI>Cyrus</HI> their Deliverer by Name; <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Visions of the <HI>Monarchies</HI> and of the <HI>Rise of
<PB N="16" REF="004916_0014_100E2DB719E86A70"/>Antichrist;</HI> to all which must be added the <HI>Prophecies of</HI> CHRIST JESUS our Lord and his Apostles in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> respecting the Destruction of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> the Dispersion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> their Preservation a <HI>distinct People</HI> among the Nations, the Revelation of the <HI>Man of Sin;</HI> the Pride, Idolatries, Bloodiness and Abominations of the <HI>Papacy;</HI> in all which GOD has <HI>magnified</HI> his Word of Truth. Verily, there has not <HI>failed</HI> one Word of all that the LORD has spoken, from the Beginning of the <HI>Bible</HI> to the End of it. — How ought the devout <HI>Believer</HI> to fall down with Ad∣miration and Delight at the <HI>Feet of Jesus,</HI> and worship the infinite prescient MIND, the faithful GOD who keepeth <HI>Truth</HI> for ever. "It stands <HI>fast</HI> for ever and ever, holy and reverend is his Name.</P>
<P N="5">V. GOD has <HI>magnified his Law</HI> by sending his SON from Heaven in <HI>our Nature</HI> to <HI>obey</HI> it, to <HI>fulfil the Righteousness</HI> therein required, and to <HI>bear the Curse</HI> for the Transgression of it. For these glorious <HI>Ends</HI> CHRIST came in the Flesh, and they are the <HI>highest Honours</HI> that the <HI>Holy GOD</HI> has done to his <HI>holy Word:</HI> According to those remarkable Words of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Chap. 42. ver. 21. <HI>"The LORD is well plea∣sed for his Righteousness sake, He will magnify the Law and make it honourable."</HI>— The SON OF GOD came down from Heaven to <HI>satisfy Divine Justice,</HI> to make ample Reparation to the <HI>Honour and Holiness</HI> of GOD, for the infinite <HI>Injury</HI> down by <HI>Man</HI>'s <HI>Sins</HI> to his <HI>Law</HI> and Government, his <HI>Crown</HI> and Throne; which stand upon his asserting and vindicating the Honour of his <HI>Law;</HI> which is more <HI>dignified</HI> in the <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Sufferings</HI> of the Son of GOD, than if <HI>Man</HI> had never <HI>sinned,</HI> or <HI>all Men</HI> had for ever <HI>suffered.</HI></P>
<P>READ the magnificent and marvellous Thing: Psal. 40. 5, 8. <HI>Many O LORD my GOD are thy wonderful Works which thou hast done, and thy Thoughts
<PB N="17" REF="004916_0015_100E2DBACC31C3E0"/>which are to us ward!</HI> (but there is <HI>one</HI> that exceeds all the rest, and that is <HI>this</HI>) <HI>Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldest not; then I said — lo I come, in the Volume of the Book it is written of me, I delight to do thy Will, O my GOD! thy</HI> LAW <HI>is within my Heart.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compare <HI>Hebrews</HI> X. 5, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> The Heart of the FATHER and SON were set on <HI>this,</HI> the doing <HI>Honour</HI> to the broken <HI>Law,</HI> in the <HI>Salvation</HI> of an <HI>Elect Number</HI> of sinful Men; in order to which, this was the deep <HI>Counsel between them both</HI> from the Days of Eter∣nity; "That the SON OF GOD should in the Fulness of Time take the <HI>Sinner's Nature,</HI> and therein fulfil the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Law, and bear the <HI>Curse</HI> of it, and answer hereby all the Demands of <HI>Justice;</HI> that the infinitely Holy GOD may be <Q><HI>sanctified</HI> in Righteous∣ness while his Grace is abounding to the chief of Sinners; that He may be <HI>just,</HI> and yet the <HI>Justifier of the Believer in</HI> JESUS.</Q> <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 26.</P>
<P>BUT let us more distinctly consider the holy <HI>Law</HI> magnified, 1. in the <HI>active,</HI> 2. in the <HI>passive</HI> Obedience of our LORD JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> By being made of a <HI>Woman</HI> he was necessarily made <HI>under the Law,</HI> the <HI>moral</HI> Law; and being of the <HI>Seed of Abraham</HI> He subjected himself to the <HI>Law of Moses</HI> then in Force, the <HI>Ceremonial Law.</HI> It be∣hoved him therefore to <HI>fulfil all Righteousness,</HI> and to present unto GOD a <HI>perfect</HI> Obedience in our Nature; and an Obedience <HI>superior</HI> to that of any meer Crea∣ture, yea of <HI>all Creatures,</HI> may be well conceived <HI>ne∣cessary</HI> in Him who was to <HI>satisfy</HI> for the Transgression of a World of Sinners, and to bring in a Righteousness for the <HI>Justification</HI> of <HI>Sinners,</HI> and become <HI>the LORD their Righteousness.</HI> Jer. 23.6.</P>
<P>IN <HI>this</HI> the Law was <HI>magnified;</HI> Isa. 45.24. <Q>Sure∣ly shall one say, in the LORD have I Righteousness and Strength; even to <HI>Him</HI> shall Men come, and all
<PB N="18" REF="004916_0016_100E2DBF35D3A1F0"/>that are incensed against him shall be ashamed; in the LORD shall all the Seed of <HI>Israel</HI> be <HI>justified,</HI> and shall glory. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. But of <HI>Him</HI> are ye in CHRIST JESUS, who of GOD is made unto us Wisdom and Righteousness and Sanctification and Redemption. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19, 21. For as by <HI>one Man's Disobedience</HI> many were made <HI>Sinners,</HI> so by the Obedience of ONE shall many be made <HI>righte∣ous,</HI> that as <HI>Sin</HI> hath reigned unto <HI>Death,</HI> even so might <HI>Grace</HI> reign thro' Righteousness unto <HI>eternal Life</HI> by JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Eternal Word</HI> (says <HI>Lanctantius</HI>) became the <HI>living Law,</HI> that the <HI>broken</HI> Law might have <HI>more Glory</HI> in his Obedience, than it had suffer'd <HI>Dishonour</HI> by Man's Transgression. He that <HI>gave</HI> the Law mag∣nify'd it by subjecting Himself to it. GOD magnify'd his <HI>Word</HI> indeed, when He made his <HI>Only-begotten</HI> un∣der it. Truly the holy Word was magnified <HI>in the Life of</HI> CHRIST, the glorious <HI>Transcript</HI> of it, which has set it in a Light <HI>dazling to Angels</HI> as well as Saints. As <HI>feeing</HI> the Light is <HI>more</HI> to us than any Description of it, so is the Exhibition of the <HI>Sanctity</HI> of GOD's Word in the Obedience of his own SON. In <HI>his Face</HI> is the <HI>Light of the Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Glory</HI> of GOD. He the <HI>true Light</HI> which enlighteneth the World! he has made other <HI>shining Lights</HI> in his Church, but is Him∣self the <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI> that has risen over them with <HI>Healing in his Wings.</HI> Mal. 4.2.</P>
<P>BUT if the <HI>Law</HI> be thus magnified by the <HI>active</HI> Obedience of CHRIST, is it not yet more so, <HI>Secondly,</HI> in and by his <HI>passive</HI> Obedience; <HI>his Obedience unto Death, the Death of the Cross;</HI> the <HI>accursed Death!</HI> He bore <HI>our Sins,</HI> he bore the <HI>Curse</HI> in his <HI>own Body</HI> on the <HI>Tree!</HI> — He redeemed us from the <HI>Curse</HI> of the Law, by being made a <HI>Curse</HI> for us; as it is written, "<HI>He that is hanged is accursed of GOD.</HI>

O sacred <HI>Law</HI> and glorious <HI>Justice!</HI> Here is Judg∣ment and Righteousness, the <HI>Habitation</HI> of GOD's Throne. When by the Law no Flesh could be <HI>justi∣fied,</HI> GOD sent his <HI>own Son</HI> in the likeness of sinful Flesh, and <HI>He</HI> by making Himself a <HI>Sacrifice for Sin,</HI> condemned it, that the <HI>Righteousness of the Law</HI> might be <HI>fulfilled</HI> in those that walk not after the Flesh, but <HI>after the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8.3, 4.</P>
<P>To <HI>magnify</HI> the holy Law, the HOLY ONE OF GOD was <HI>number'd with Transgressors;</HI> was made a <HI>Sin-Offering!</HI> The Day and Hour of our LORD's <HI>Cru∣cifixion</HI> was that of the <HI>Law's Triumph:</HI> It was <HI>seen</HI> so by <HI>Angels,</HI> the same <HI>Holy Ones</HI> who were at <HI>Sinai,</HI> on the <HI>holy Mount,</HI> at the Law's Delivery in <HI>Fire;</HI> and now they saw a <HI>fiercer Flame</HI> than any that had ever <HI>burnt up the Wicked.</HI> Now, to the <HI>Principalities and Powers</HI> in the heavenly Places was shown more of the <HI>tremendous Holiness</HI> than they had ever seen before. — They had <HI>seen a World of Angels</HI> cast down from <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> for their Sin, and now they saw <HI>a World of Sinners</HI> delivered from <HI>Hell</HI> by Faith in the <HI>Blood</HI> of a great <HI>Propitiation</HI> held forth from <HI>Heaven!</HI> This, with great Reverence, they <HI>desire to look into,</HI> with <HI>cover'd Faces;</HI> and cry, "<HI>Holy, holy, holy is the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS, <HI>the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>O stupendous and <HI>magnificent</HI> Thing! estimate the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD by the <HI>Blood</HI> of his Son! or illustrate the Matter by a <HI>low Comparison,</HI> accounted <HI>Great</HI> among Men. "The noble <HI>Roman</HI> gave up his <HI>two Sons</HI> when they had conspir'd against the <HI>State;</HI> and the People were ready to <HI>worship</HI> him, as more than a Man: for the <HI>Law</HI> was visibly more to him, than any Ties of Flesh and Blood. — But <HI>our</HI> GOD, the supream <HI>Lawgiver</HI> and Judge, to preserve the Honour of his <HI>Government,</HI> "spared not his <HI>own most holy</HI> SON, but deliver'd Him up for us; for such a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and <HI>such an High-Priest became us; holy, harmless, undefiled, se∣parate
<PB N="20" REF="004916_0018_100E2DC677A86DA8"/>from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens.</HI> Heb. 7.26. If He would save us, he must <HI>die</HI> him∣self, and satisfy the Law.</P>
<P N="6">VI. GOD has <HI>magnified his Word,</HI> in that He now <HI>governs</HI> the World by it, and will <HI>judge</HI> it hereby in the <HI>last Day.</HI> This is the natural and essential Honour of the <HI>Holy Word,</HI> that it is the most wise, holy, per∣fect Rule of GOD's Government and Judgment. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>natural World</HI> has been dreadfully <HI>judged</HI> for <HI>Man</HI>'s Transgression of the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD, and shall at last be <HI>burnt up</HI> in Honour to it.</P>
<P>GOD magnified his <HI>Word</HI> when he <HI>curs'd the Ground</HI> for Man's Sin. The whole <HI>Creation</HI> groans to this Day and <HI>travails in Pain</HI> under it. The Creation shall <HI>suffer,</HI> but not the <HI>Law.</HI> And it will be <HI>literally</HI> seen in the last Day, that <HI>Heaven and Earth shall pass away,</HI> but not <HI>one tittle</HI> of the Law in any wise.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>intellectual moral World</HI> are govern'd and <HI>judg'd</HI> by the <HI>glorious Word</HI> of GOD. Both the King∣dom of <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> are administred according to it.</P>
<P>First, The Kingdom of <HI>Providence:</HI> <Q>GOD reign∣eth over the <HI>Heathen,</HI> sitting on the <HI>Throne</HI> of his Holiness; his <HI>Eyes</HI> behold, his Eye-lids try the Children of Men; from the Place of his Habitation he looketh upon all the Children of Men; He fashi∣oneth their Hearts alike, he considereth all their Works; He <HI>judges</HI> the World with Righteousness and the People with his Truth.</Q> (See <HI>Psalm</HI> 33 and 96.) Such is GOD's daily magnifying his <HI>Word</HI> in the written Promises and Threatnings of it respecting Per∣sons and Places: He brings forth his <HI>Judgments as the Light</HI> through a wicked World; by <HI>terrible things</HI> in
<PB N="21" REF="004916_0019_100E2DC851C63390"/>Righteousness he <HI>answers the Faith</HI> and Prayers of his People, and fulfils the <HI>Fears</HI> of his and their Ene∣mies: He empties the <HI>Vials</HI> of his Wrath, and is <HI>known</HI> by the Judgments which he executes; his <HI>Word</HI> is magnified in 'em all: Psal. 58.11. <HI>So that a Man shall say, Verily there is a Reward for the righteous, ve∣rily a GOD that judgeth in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, According to his <HI>Word</HI> is the present Kingdom and <HI>Empire of his Grace</HI> in and over the Souls of his <HI>Elect.</HI> This is the <HI>spiritual</HI> Glory of the Word; little <HI>observed</HI> but most observably <HI>magnified</HI> to a care∣less World.</P>
<P>ON the one Hand, it is <HI>dreadful</HI> to think how the Word of GOD is magnified in the <HI>Obduration</HI> of ob∣stinate Sinners, according to that amazing <HI>Message</HI> which CHRIST put into his Prophet's Mouth <HI>when he saw his Glory,</HI> Isa. 6.9. <Q>Go tell this People, <HI>hear</HI> ye indeed but <HI>understand not,</HI> and <HI>see</HI> ye indeed but <HI>perceive not!</HI> make the Heart of this People <HI>fat,</HI> and make their Ears heavy, and <HI>shut</HI> their Eyes; lest they <HI>see</HI> with their Eyes, and <HI>hear</HI> with their Ears, and <HI>understand</HI> with their Heart, and <HI>convert</HI> and be healed.</Q></P>
<P>BUT on the other Hand, how <HI>glorious</HI> is it to the divine <HI>Word,</HI> that it has a Power and Efficacy given it for the <HI>Conversion</HI> and Salvation of as many as GOD has <HI>ordained</HI> to Life everlasting! How great is its Glo∣ry in their effectual Calling and Sanctification? — So the <HI>Rod of Moses</HI> was at the same time <HI>magnified</HI> in the Sight of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and all his People, and in the Eyes of the <HI>Israel</HI> of GOD; in the Destruction of the one and Salvation of the other.</P>
<P>WE read over and over the most <HI>magnificent Cele∣brations</HI> of the divine <HI>Law,</HI> in its <HI>saving Effects</HI> on the Souls of Men: <Q>The <HI>Law</HI> of the LORD is <HI>perfect,</HI> converting the Soul; the <HI>Testimonies</HI> of the LORD are <HI>sure,</HI> making wise the Simple; the <HI>Statutes</HI> of
<PB N="22" REF="004916_0020_100E2DCCA8459DB8"/>the LORD are <HI>right,</HI> rejoicing the <HI>Heart,</HI> the <HI>Com∣mandment</HI> of the LORD is <HI>pure,</HI> enlightning the <HI>Eyes,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.16. I am not ashamed of the <HI>Gospel of</HI> CHRIST, for it is the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD unto Sal∣vation to them that believe. <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.12. For the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is <HI>quick</HI> and powerful, <HI>sharper</HI> than any two edged Sword, <HI>peircing</HI> even to the dividing asunder the Soul and Spirit, and is a <HI>Discerner</HI> of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart; neither is there any Creature that is not <HI>manifest</HI> in his Sight, but all Things are <HI>naked</HI> and open unto the Eyes of HIM with whom we have to do. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.5. For the <HI>Weapons of our Warfare</HI> are not carnal, but <HI>mighty</HI> through GOD to the pulling down <HI>strong-holds;</HI> casting down Imaginations and every <HI>high Thing</HI> that exalteth it self against the Knowledge of GOD, and bringing into <HI>Captivity</HI> every <HI>Thought</HI> to the Obedi∣ence of CHRIST.</Q></P>
<P>THIS, <HI>this</HI> is GOD's <HI>magnifying his Word</HI> to a spiri∣tual Eye, to the best and greatest Purposes, when <HI>Sin∣ners</HI> are convinc'd and <HI>pricked</HI> to the Heart by it! When the <HI>Commandment comes</HI> with a divine <HI>Light</HI> and Power on their Consciences; when <HI>Sin</HI> by it becomes <HI>exceeding</HI> sinful; and <HI>Moses</HI> himself <HI>quakes,</HI> and the hardy <HI>Taylor trembles</HI> and cries out, "<HI>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</HI> — But then the <HI>mild Reign</HI> and Rule of Grace in the Souls of the <HI>Regenerate</HI> is yet <HI>more</HI> magnificent; GOD having <HI>put</HI> his Law in their Heart, and <HI>written</HI> it in them, and <HI>shed abroad his Love!</HI> and they become his <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Palace,</HI> incomparably be∣yond those of <HI>Solomon</HI> or <HI>Herod!</HI> O how does the en∣lightned Soul <HI>magnify the Word,</HI> whose Power it has felt, whose Glory it has seen, and calls it <HI>honourable?</HI> It reverences and delights in it, fears and <HI>stands in Awe</HI> of it, <HI>esteems</HI> it concerning all things to be right, and <HI>hates</HI> every false Way! Because it is very <HI>pure,</HI> there∣fore the Soul <HI>loves</HI> it, takes it for its <HI>Heritage</HI> for ever,
<PB N="23" REF="004916_0021_100E26A284158070"/>and makes it its <HI>exceeding Joy;</HI> is quickned daily and comforted by it, and esteems it as its necessary <HI>Food, tastes</HI> that it is good. O how the holy Soul magnifies GOD for his Word and gives Him <HI>Glory</HI> on the Ac∣count of it! <Q>I will <HI>never forget</HI> thy Precepts, for by them Thou hast <HI>quickned me;</HI> I have <HI>chosen the Way of Truth,</HI> thy Judgments have laid before me; and I will walk at <HI>Liberty</HI> and seek thy Pre∣cepts.</Q> — This is the Glory that <HI>excelleth!</HI> for what are <HI>Prophecies</HI> or <HI>Miracles</HI> themselves, in Comparison herewith? as the LORD has said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.22. <Q>Ma∣ny will say to me, <HI>Lord, Lord,</HI> have we not <HI>pro∣phesied</HI> in thy Name, and in thy Name have cast out <HI>Devils,</HI> and in thy Name done many <HI>wondrous</HI> Works; and then will I profess unto them, I <HI>never</HI> knew you, <HI>depart</HI> from me ye that work Iniquity.</Q>—The <HI>End</HI> of the holy <HI>Word</HI> is the saving Illumination and Conquest of <HI>Souls,</HI> and in this it is <HI>magnified,</HI> has its <HI>Course and is glorified,</HI> and GOD is <HI>admired</HI> in it for ever and ever. It remains only to say,</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD has <HI>magnified</HI> his Word above all his <HI>Name,</HI> for it is the <HI>rule of the General and eternal Judgment.</HI> Joh. 12.48. <HI>The Word that I have spoken, the same shall jndge you in the last Day.</HI> What <HI>less</HI> than this can be the <HI>Honour</HI> of the Divine <HI>Law,</HI> and what <HI>greater</HI> Honour can be done it? By it the <HI>Eternal</HI> State of Men will be decided? How awful and reverend should this make it? according to it will our final Judgment be.</P>
<P>IN humane <HI>Courts</HI> of Judicature the <HI>Law</HI> is the Thing magnified; the <HI>Judges</HI> reverence and determine by the <HI>Law;</HI> the <HI>Jurors</HI> are sworn to go according to it; the <HI>People</HI> submit their Estate, Liberty and Life to it. What is more venerable, and what more for∣midable than the righteous <HI>Law,</HI> and the impartial Administration of Judgment by it? But if the Deter∣mination
<PB N="24" REF="004916_0022_100E2DCEEAA89FB0"/>of Men's <HI>temperal</HI> Interests, by the Judgment of <HI>humane</HI> Laws, be so awful and venerable to Men, how much more must the Decision of Men's <HI>eternal</HI> State, by the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> magnify <HI>that</HI> and make it dreadful?</P>
<P>READ how the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks of it, Rom. 2.16: <HI>In the Day when</HI> GOD <HI>shall judge the Secrets of Men by</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>according to my Gospel; for as many as have sinned in the Law shall be judged by the Law.</HI> So CHRIST hath clothed the written <HI>Word</HI> with his own <HI>Majesty</HI> and Glory, that it may be <HI>fearful</HI> to us: As the FATHER has committed all Judgment to <HI>Him,</HI> that all Men should honour the SON even as they honour the FATHER. — "<HI>Have I not Power to cru∣cify thee? and Power to release thee?</HI> said the <HI>Judge</HI> of old, when he would <HI>magnify himself above the Law:</HI> But the supream <HI>Law-giver</HI> must of <HI>Right</HI> and Neces∣sity invest the <HI>Law</HI> with this Glory, that it has Power to justify and condemn: This Power is given it from <HI>on high,</HI> and it is herein greatly magnified; as in the <HI>Process</HI> of the last Judgment, <HI>Revel.</HI> 20.11, 12. <Q>And I saw a <HI>great white Throne</HI> and <HI>Him</HI> that sat on it, from whose <HI>Face</HI> the Earth and Heaven fled away! And I saw the <HI>Dead, small and great,</HI> stand before GOD, and the <HI>Books</HI> were opened, and ano∣ther Book was opened, which is the <HI>Book of Life;</HI> and the <HI>dead were judged</HI> out of those Things which were written in the Books according to their Works; —<HI>and Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of Fire.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THUS our <HI>Bible,</HI> that now neglected and slighted <HI>Book</HI> by many, will be <HI>open'd</HI> by the inthron'd JESUS at the last Day; when he will magnify it by judging the World according to it. This is his final <HI>aggran∣dizing</HI> it; Psal. 76.7, 8. <HI>The Earth feared and was still, when GOD arose to Judgment, to save all the Meek of the Earth; surely the Wrath of Man shall praise thee.</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="004916_0023_100E2DD3988C87D8"/>Psal. 96. ult. <HI>Before the</HI> LORD, <HI>for he cometh, for be cometh to judge the Earth; he shall judge the World with Righteousness, and the People with his Truth.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>Proof</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> "that the Great GOD <HI>has magnified his Word</HI> to us, and will magnify it in the highest Manner. — I come now to the <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P>LET <HI>us</HI> then see to it that <HI>we magnify</HI> GOD the LORD and his <HI>holy Word</HI> in our <HI>Hearts and Lives,</HI> and with our <HI>Lips.</HI>—We magnify it by <HI>believing</HI> it, and O could we be strong in <HI>Faith,</HI> giving <HI>Glory</HI> to GOD! We magnify it by <HI>admiring</HI> and <HI>loving</HI> it, <Q><HI>thy Pre∣cepts are wonderful, therefore doth my Soul keep them;</HI> thy Word is very <HI>pure,</HI> therefore thy Servant <HI>loveth</HI> it.</Q></P>
<P>GOD has <HI>magnified</HI> his Word that we should <HI>fear</HI> it, <HI>tremble and quake</HI> at it; and to <HI>this Man</HI> will the <HI>High and losty One</HI> look, even to him that is <HI>poor</HI> and of a <HI>contrite Spirit,</HI> and that <HI>trembleth</HI> at his Word.</P>
<P>GOD has magnified his <HI>Word</HI> to us to magnify <HI>our Sins</HI> to us, that by the <HI>Commandment</HI> they may be ex∣ceeding <HI>sinful;</HI> for how have they vilified that great holy <HI>Law</HI> which GOD has magnified in the <HI>Condemna∣tion</HI> of them?—We therefore magnify his <HI>Word</HI> by our <HI>repenting</HI> in Dust and Ashes; <HI>turning</HI> from all Sin with holy mourning, godly sorrowing, self-loathing: "<HI>O my</HI> GOD, <HI>I am ashamed and blush to lift up my Fyes unto thee, my</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>WE magnify GOD's <HI>Word</HI> by <HI>hoping</HI> in it, and by <HI>looking for the Mercy of our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>unto eternal Life</HI> according to it; for whose <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> sake GOD is well <HI>pleased,</HI> will <HI>magnify the Law</HI> and make it honourable: <Q><HI>I hope in thy Word! I will praise thee, even thy Truth! The faithful GOD which keepeth Covenant and Mercy.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004916_0024_100E2DD613497C18"/>
Finally, WE magnify the holy sovereign <HI>Word</HI> by our <HI>Obedience</HI> to it, and our religious <HI>Observance</HI> of all its <HI>Institutions</HI> and Ordinances: <Q><HI>Only obey my voice,</HI> has the great and good GOD said to us; and again, <HI>Why call ye me</HI> LORD, LORD, <HI>and do not the Things which I say?</HI>—To <HI>obey</HI> is better than <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> and to <HI>bearken</HI> than the <HI>Fat</HI> of Rams.</Q></P>
<P>IN short, the whole <HI>Result</HI> of Faith, Love, Admi∣ration, Fear, Repentance, Hope, is <HI>Obedience.</HI> The <HI>Grandeur of the Law</HI> lies in its <HI>Rule</HI> over us, its <HI>Com∣mand</HI> of us: That is, in our sincere, universal, delight∣ful, persevering <HI>Obedience</HI> to it; for <HI>Obedience</HI> is the <HI>Summary</HI> of Law and Gospel; it is the Religion, Ho∣liness, Blessedness, Magnificence of <HI>Heaven:</HI> <Q><HI>Bless the</HI> LORD <HI>ye his Angels that excel in Strength, that do his Commandments, hearkning to the Voice of his Word.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WE must <HI>magnify</HI> the Word of GOD in our Places, by honouring it <HI>to one another;</HI> as <HI>Parents</HI> to their Children; <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.6. <Q>These Words shall be in thy <HI>Heart,</HI> and thou shalt <HI>teach</HI> them diligently unto thy <HI>Children,</HI> and talk of them when thou sittest in thy House: <HI>Housholders</HI> to their Families, that the Blessing of <HI>Abraham</HI> may come on them; <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.19. "For I <HI>know him,</HI> that he will <HI>command his Houshold</HI> after him to keep the Ways of the LORD: <HI>Ministers</HI> to their <HI>Flocks;</HI> <Q><HI>preach</HI> the Word, be <HI>instant,</HI> in Season and out of Season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by Manifestation of the <HI>Truth,</HI> commending your selves to every Man's Conscience in the Sight of GOD: <HI>Magistrates</HI> to their People, <HI>as Ministers of</HI> GOD <HI>un∣to them for good, Terrors</HI> unto Evil-doers, and a <HI>Praise</HI> to them that do well. Finally, <HI>all</HI> and every one of us in our several Places, as <HI>holy Brethren,</HI> Partakers of the <HI>Heavenly Calling;</HI> a <HI>chosen Genera∣tion,</HI> a <HI>Kingdom of Priests,</HI> a <HI>holy Nation, a peculiar</HI> People, to shew forth the <HI>Praises of Him</HI> who hath
<PB N="27" REF="004916_0025_100E2DD9A9F42C60"/>called us out of Darkness into his marvellous Light.</Q> And thus GOD magnifies <HI>them</HI> who magnify his <HI>Word,</HI> and they are unto Him for <HI>a Name, a Praise and Glory.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To conclude, We magnify the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD by magnifying his <HI>Worship,</HI> private, secret and public; in a constant reverend Observation thereof, in the most serious and solemn Manner; in our <HI>Closets,</HI> with our <HI>Families,</HI> and in the <HI>Assemblies</HI> from <HI>Sabbath</HI> to Sabbath, and on <HI>Lectures.</HI>—In a particular Manner we must magnify the <HI>Lord's-Day,</HI> the <HI>Holy of the</HI> LORD <HI>and honourable,</HI> if we would magnify his <HI>Word:</HI> for with <HI>this</HI> the <HI>Bible</HI> begins and ends, our <HI>being in the Spirit</HI> on the <HI>weekly Sabbath;</HI> it is the <HI>first</HI> Thing in the <HI>Old Testament</HI> and the <HI>last</HI> in the <HI>New.</HI> And the whole inspired <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI> is full of a holy <HI>Ministry,</HI> the Word Sacraments and Prayer.</P>
<P>WE magnify the LORD JESUS our <HI>King,</HI> our <HI>Law∣giver</HI> and our <HI>Judge,</HI> while we assemble to <HI>pray</HI> in his <HI>Name,</HI> to sit at his Feet and <HI>hear</HI> his Word, bring our <HI>Seed</HI> to his <HI>Baptism,</HI> and shew forth his <HI>Death</HI> at his <HI>Table.</HI>—He has said to us, <Q>Blessed is the Man that <HI>heareth me,</HI> watching daily at my <HI>Gates,</HI> wait∣ing at the Posts of my <HI>Doors!</HI></Q> And again, <Q>I will declare <HI>thy Name</HI> unto my <HI>Brethren,</HI> in the midst of the <HI>Congregation</HI> will I praise thee: And again, <HI>Behold I and the Children whom thou hast given me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND now, <HI>my dear People,</HI> the <HI>Day</HI> (my <HI>own</HI> and <HI>yours</HI>) calls upon me to <HI>seize</HI> the present Opportunity, to leave my <HI>dying</HI> Counsel and <HI>Charge</HI> with you, both <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Churches.</HI></P>
<P>AND first to <HI>Ministers,</HI> — let us (my dear <HI>Brethren</HI>) <HI>magnify our Office,</HI> and the <HI>Word</HI> which we are called to <HI>preach,</HI> by a due Care as to the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of our Preaching. "<HI>If any Man speak</HI> (says the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> 1st Epist. 4th Chap. ver. 11.) <HI>let him
<PB N="28" REF="004916_0026_100E2DDD08D79878"/>speak</HI> AS THE ORACLES OF GOD; in a Manner worthy of these <HI>sacred Oracles;</HI> beseeming the Dignity, Majesty, Sanctity, Authority, Importance of those Di∣vine <HI>Oracles. — We are Labourers together with GOD, ye are God's Husbandry and Building; as a wise Master-builder, I</HI> (said the blessed <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>have laid the Founda∣tion, and another buildeth thereon; but let every Man take heed how be build;</HI> that it be <HI>Gold, Silver, precious Stones; not Wood, Hay, Stubble,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.9. — My <HI>Brethren,</HI> we have <HI>precious Materials</HI> provided for us, and great should be our Care that they be <HI>well laid</HI> together and <HI>cemented;</HI> remembring that we are build∣ing <HI>for</HI> GOD and <HI>with</HI> Him; that by his Power and Help we may both build up our <HI>own</HI> and our People's Souls <HI>on our most holy Faith;</HI> a <HI>spiritual House</HI> to offer up spiritual <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> acceptable to GOD through our LORD JESUS CHRIST. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5.</P>
<P>WELL <HI>Brethren,</HI> Did we serve out our <HI>Time</HI> well in preparatory <HI>Studies</HI> and Prayers for our <HI>entring</HI> on this high and holy working with GOD and for Him? And did we accordingly enter on it with a due <HI>Solemnity</HI> of Soul? with something of <HI>Isaiah's Vision</HI> of the Divine MAJESTY on his <HI>Throne</HI> high and lifted up, and his <HI>Train</HI> filling his Temples; the <HI>Seraphims</HI> covering their Faces before Him! <HI>Isaiah,</HI> 6th Chap.</P>
<P>AH how <HI>wanting</HI> may we have been in this <HI>awful</HI> Consideration of GOD and his <HI>Word,</HI> when we <HI>gave our selves to Him,</HI> and to <HI>his People by his Will,</HI> to mi∣nister unto their <HI>Souls,</HI> as those that must give <HI>an Ac∣count?</HI> And how have we <HI>serv'd</HI> those <HI>for whom</HI> CHRIST <HI>died,</HI> in the Course of our <HI>Ministry?</HI> Have we preach'd, <HI>not our selves,</HI> but CHRIST JESUS THE LORD; <HI>and our selves their Servants for</HI> JESUS <HI>sake?</HI> — Has CHRIST, his Doctrine, his holy Law and Life, his perfect Example and glorious Works, his Humi∣lity, Meekness and Charity, his Zeal for Truth and Holiness, his servent Devotions and absolute Submis∣sions
<PB N="29" REF="004916_0027_100E2DE108639540"/>to the Will and Glory of GOD; his ineffable Love to Souls, and Demands from us of a like Love to <HI>Him</HI> and his <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Lambs?</HI> — Has <HI>his</HI> Obedience unto Death, the Death of the Cross; the Atonement made thereby for the Sins of his Elect, and Satisfaction to the Justice of GOD for the Violation of his sacred Law; and the everlasting Righteousness thereby bro't in for the Redemption, Justification and eternal Salva∣tion of believing repenting Sinners; — Have (I say) these <HI>peculiar Glories of the Gospel been magnified by us in our Sermons and Administrations in the House of GOD,</HI> and in our more private <HI>Applications</HI> to the Souls of our <HI>Flocks?</HI> Have we thus behav'd <HI>in the Church of the living GOD,</HI> which is the <HI>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</HI> regarding <HI>these</HI> Truths as the <HI>Pillars,</HI> Strength and Or∣nament of the sacred, spiritual <HI>Edifice?</HI></P>
<P>AND now, my dear and honour'd <HI>Hearers,</HI> I must give in my humble <HI>Testimony,</HI> and a <HI>noble</HI> one, on be∣half of CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD the Great HEAD <HI>of the Church,</HI> and of his <HI>Grace</HI> to you, in the MINI∣STRY which in my Times <HI>He</HI> has set over you, in <HI>this</HI> and many <HI>other</HI> Places of our happy and distinguish'd <HI>Land;</HI> — "that a <HI>great Number of them</HI> have been such as in their Doctrine and Conversation have been enabled to <HI>magnify the Name and Word</HI> of our LORD JESUS to you, in their <HI>Preparations</HI> for the Pulpit, and in their Manner of <HI>Address</HI> to GOD and you from it; and the present <HI>Pastors</HI> of the Churches (in a great Number of 'em) if I am able to judge, do not come short of their worthy Predecessors, but are building fair and strong on their Foundation, as <HI>wise and faithful Servants;</HI> and GOD is <HI>owning</HI> them greatly before you and <HI>blessing</HI> their Labours: The Blessing of <HI>Levi</HI> is with them, the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim,</HI> in a happy Mea∣sure of <HI>Light, Zeal</HI> and <HI>Sincerity,</HI> thro' free and sove∣reign <HI>Grace;</HI> and they do not serve GOD and you with <HI>unbeaten Oil,</HI> with what costs 'em nothing, but the
<PB N="30" REF="004916_0028_100E2DE36E3C0B58"/><HI>Lamps</HI> burn <HI>clear</HI> and bright before you. In my <HI>Age</HI> I sit, <HI>hear</HI> and admire the labour'd, digested, methodical, enlightning, servent <HI>Discourses</HI> they bring you; such as they might bring before <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Universities,</HI> and not be ashamed; and yet all adapted to the <HI>poor of the Flock</HI> and to the <HI>lowest</HI> Understandings among you; even to the very <HI>Negroes</HI> of your Families, many of whom are become intelligent and <HI>serious</HI> among us. And I humbly trust, that after my <HI>Decease</HI> CHRIST will be <HI>still magnified</HI> in his preached Gospel among you; — I mean by the <HI>rising Ministry,</HI> many of whom appear to me to be coming forth into the Service of the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> as with a superior <HI>Zeal</HI> for the Honour of CHRIST, and to <HI>save themselves and those that bear them;</HI> so with a Care for proper <HI>Furniture</HI> by diligent <HI>Study,</HI> to give <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> together, in their well composed and deliver'd <HI>Sermons,</HI> which are acceptable and profitable to our <HI>Flocks.</HI></P>
<P>AND I earnestly exhort these my <HI>younger Brethren,</HI> together with the very promising, studious and serious <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Ministry now in our <HI>College,</HI> that they <HI>emulate the Learning</HI> and <HI>Labours</HI> of the present <HI>Pastors</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> round about them; and yet more those of the FIRST FATHERS of our <HI>Country;</HI> who with equal Care and <HI>Speed</HI> founded our Churches, <HI>Schools</HI> and Colleges together, and never separated their <HI>Bibles</HI> and <HI>Literature</HI> in their Preparations for public Serviceableness, but kept the <HI>one</HI> in reverend <HI>Subjection</HI> to the other. — So my SONS, do you study your <HI>Bibles</HI> first and most, and then <HI>use</HI> all your Acquisitions of <HI>humane</HI> Knowledge, and your peculiar <HI>natural</HI> Gifts and Powers, whether of <HI>Reasoning</HI> or <HI>Oratory,</HI> to re∣commend and inforce the <HI>lively Oracles</HI> of GOD to the <HI>Understanding</HI> and on the <HI>Affections</HI> of those to whom you may be called to minister. — For if you go off from <HI>studied Sermons,</HI> you will I fear <HI>lose</HI> all that the <HI>Fathers</HI> of these Churches have wrought for us; and
<PB N="31" REF="004916_0029_100E2DE6D0DCE500"/>will come (unlike <HI>them</HI>) to this People, with empty Noise of Address to their <HI>Passions only,</HI> which is not the Way of your <HI>Bible,</HI> nor of the HOLY SPIRIT who inspir'd it, who by the Understanding enters the <HI>Heart,</HI> convincing Men of <HI>Sin,</HI> of <HI>Righteousness and Judgment,</HI> their lost and perishing State, and Need of a SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>LET me recommend to <HI>you</HI> Dr. WATTS his <HI>hum∣ble Attempt for the Revival of Religion;</HI> a <HI>Book</HI> worthy to be read and deeply consider'd by <HI>Ministers and Peo∣ple;</HI> and in a particular Manner by the <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Evangelical Ministry, before they enter on the Work of Preaching; that in their Composures they may <HI>equally</HI> remember how much they have to do with the <HI>Mind</HI> and Understanding, and also with the <HI>Hearts</HI> and Consciences of their Hearers; and with HIM that <HI>made</HI> Man's Heart and <HI>searches</HI> it, and only can reach and <HI>change</HI> it: Accordingly "<HI>methodize,</HI> explain, illus∣trate, prove, infer upon and <HI>apply</HI> the Subjects which you undertake, as in the Fear of GOD you truly judge will <HI>most magnify the Word</HI> you preach, and <HI>benefit</HI> the Souls of Men. — To which <HI>End</HI> also I do with like Earnestness recommend to <HI>Students</HI> and younger <HI>Mini∣sters</HI> (and also to private <HI>Christians</HI>) a like admirable Book of Dr. WATTS's, of the "<HI>Use and Abuse of the Passions in Matters of Religion;</HI> as surprisingly calculated for our <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Admonition</HI> at this Day.</P>
<P>AND suffer me, my <HI>dear People,</HI> now I am it may be taking Leave of this <HI>Desk,</HI> in a particular Manner to intimate to you my Apprehension and <HI>Fear</HI> of great <HI>Dishonour to the Word of GOD,</HI> and of <HI>Danger</HI> to your <HI>Souls</HI> and those of your <HI>Families,</HI> and therefore of <HI>Ruin</HI> to the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> if we give Counte∣nance and Encouragement to <HI>illiterate</HI> and <HI>half-learnt</HI> Persons to go about <HI>exhorting</HI> and drawing <HI>Hearers</HI> by their <HI>Shew of Affection</HI> to Souls for their spiritual Profit and saving Good, or from their <HI>sincere Desire</HI> thereof; for it certainly <HI>tends</HI> in Time to run the Churches into
<PB N="32" REF="004916_0030_100E2DE99769C640"/><HI>Confusion,</HI> and to bring the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the Word into <HI>Contempt.</HI> — I must needs therefore <HI>repeat</HI> my <HI>public Caution</HI> to you some <HI>Months</HI> ago, <Q>that you would no more <HI>run</HI> from your own <HI>Pastors</HI> with such open Disrespect after every <HI>new</HI> Face or fervent Voice, with far less Furniture for your real spiritual Edifica∣tion.</Q> We may well blush for some who have sat so long, and profited so well, under our Ministry, and yet have no more attained to a true Taste and Judgment. Your <HI>Ministers</HI> have been and are, from Time to Time, earnestly and powerfully addressing to your <HI>Affections</HI> and Passions as well as <HI>Reason,</HI> with a <HI>distinct</HI> Sound and <HI>superiour</HI> Light, such as no <HI>uncertain</HI> Flashes out of Clouds and Darkness may at all compare with.</P>
<P>I <HI>close</HI> with giving <HI>Glory</HI> to GOD for the <HI>Great and good Work of his Grace,</HI> which He has so <HI>visibly begun, spread</HI> and is <HI>carrying on,</HI> in every <HI>Part</HI> almost of our <HI>Provinces;</HI> which that <HI>we may all</HI> in our respective Places <HI>subserve,</HI> under the <HI>special Direction,</HI> Restraint, Influence and Enlargement of the BLESSED SPIRIT <HI>of Truth, Holiness and Love;</HI> (WHOM I sincerely and most thankfully desire to <HI>adore</HI> as "<HI>magnifying</HI> therein <HI>his Word above all his Name</HI>) is I hope my <HI>single Aim</HI> in what I have now said; — and may all the <HI>Churches</HI> say, AMEN, <HI>praise ye the</HI> LORD.</P>
