<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Psalm LXVIII. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Let <HI>GOD</HI> arise, let his Enemies be scattered; let them also that hate Him flee before Him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE <HI>Words</HI> begin a Triumphant <HI>Psalm</HI> of <HI>David</HI>'s, the <HI>Subject</HI> whereof is the Majesty and Pow∣er and Mercies of God, display'd in the Salvations of his Church, past and to come. The <HI>Triumphs</HI> of the GOD of <HI>Israel</HI> are here Celebrated, in a <HI>Style</HI> and Ex∣pression <HI>Lofty</HI> like the <HI>Place</HI> wherein He dwells, and <HI>Great</HI> as the <HI>Works</HI> they praise. There is a Mixture of <HI>History</HI> and <HI>Prophesie,</HI> a <HI>Review</HI> of the Glorious things which God had wro't for his Church from the days of <HI>Moses,</HI> and a Predicti∣on of the greater Salvation by the MESSIAH to come; His Victorious and Triumphant <HI>As∣cention,</HI> and leading <HI>Captivity Captive. v.</HI> 18.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001294_0004_0FB27C05842E2508"/>
The <HI>Occasion</HI> of the <HI>Psalm</HI> seems very obvious, tho' particular-Passages in it are Intricate and Perplex'd; so that One of the <HI>Criticks</HI> said of it, <Q>that there are almost as many Shelfs and Labyrinths in it, as there are Verses and Words, and that it merits to be called the Tryal of the Wits of Interpreters, and their disgrace:</Q> Yet (I say) the Occasion of the <HI>Psalm</HI> seems very plain, and that it was Compo∣sed for and used at that Illustrious <HI>Solemnity</HI> in <HI>David's</HI> Reign, the Translation of the <HI>Ark of the Covenant</HI> from the <HI>House of Obed-Edom</HI> unto <HI>Zi∣on;</HI> for the words of the <HI>Text,</HI> which are the <HI>Exordium</HI> of the <HI>Psalm,</HI> are the very same that <HI>Moses</HI> always used at the <HI>Removal</HI> of the <HI>Ark:</HI> Numb. 10.35. <HI>And it came to pass when the Ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up,</HI> LORD, <HI>and let thine Enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee!</HI></P>
<P>This then was the <HI>Original</HI> of the <HI>Text,</HI> being the words of <HI>Moses,</HI> the Lords <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the first <HI>Ruler</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> and Ancient as the <HI>first Re∣demption</HI> of His Church, and the days of their <HI>Travels</HI> in the <HI>Wilderness;</HI> where the Lord <HI>Led his People like a Flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</HI> As soon as the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> was <HI>reared up,</HI> and the <HI>Ark of the Testimony</HI> was in its place, <HI>&amp;c, Then a Cloud covered the Tent of the Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle. The Cloud of the Lord was upon it by day, and Fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the House of Israel,
<PB N="3" REF="001294_0005_0FB27C0707CC6238"/>thro'out all their Journeys. And when the Cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, the Children of Israel went onward in all their Journeys: But if the Cloud were not taken up, then they Journyed not, till the day that it was taken up.</HI> No doubt it was a very joyful sight to that People when the <HI>Cloud</HI> rose up, God therein appearing to 'em to be making good his <HI>Promise,</HI> and leading them to <HI>Canaan:</HI> And the <HI>Phrase</HI> agree to their very <HI>sight, Rise up Lord!</HI> for there was a visible Ap∣pearance to their <HI>Senses</HI> of his doing so, as the <HI>Cloud was taken up.</HI></P>
<P>It is very probable, that this <HI>Form of Prayer</HI> at the <HI>taking up</HI> of the <HI>Ark,</HI> was by Divine Ap∣pointment to be <HI>for ever used</HI> on this Occasion and Solemnity, as often as the <HI>Levites</HI> shou'd e∣ver be called in all future Generations to Offici∣ate in <HI>Bearing the Ark:</HI> At least 'tis past doubt that <HI>Moses</HI> at first spake these words by <HI>Inspirati∣on,</HI> and Inspir'd <HI>David</HI> retaining them as the most Apt and Ancient, and the best that could be on the great Occasion.</P>
<P>This Famous <HI>Prayer</HI> consists of <HI>two Petitions,</HI> one giving the Reason of the other.</P>
<P><HI>Let God arise.</HI> It is spoken after the manner of men, as when we implore speedy Succour of another, we suppose his <HI>Rising</HI> and hast'ning to our Relief. 'Tis a <HI>Phrase</HI> usual in Scrip∣ture, and Significant of Gods affording timely and present Help unto His People who trust in him; and equally of his taking speedy Venge∣ance
<PB N="4" REF="001294_0006_0FB27C0964E42720"/>of His and their Enemies. Psal. 12.5. <HI>For the Oppression of the Poor, for the sighing of the Nee∣dy, now will I arise, (saith the Lord) I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.</HI> 102.13. <HI>Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion.</HI> Jer. 2.27. <HI>In the time of their Trouble they will say, Arise and Save us.</HI> So also in Inflicting Judgment, God is said to <HI>Arise:</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. 14.22.33.10. Job 31.14.</NOTE> <HI>What shall I do when God riseth up, &amp; when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</HI></P>
<P>To both <HI>Senses</HI> the <HI>Phrase</HI> is necessarily deter∣mined in the <HI>Text:</HI> The <HI>First</HI> is implied, <HI>soil.</HI> Gods timely appearing for the Protection and Defence of his People; for the <HI>Ark</HI> (at the Removes of which the <HI>Words</HI> were uttered) was the Glorious and Special<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 132.8. 1 Sam. 4.3. a Sam. 15.24, 25. Jer. 3.16. Rev. 11.19.</NOTE> Symbol of Jehovahs Presence, and his giving Strength unto his Peo∣ple: Hence 'tis called, the <HI>Ark of his Strength,</HI> and from this Conception about it the Army of <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Eli's</HI> time sent for the <HI>Ark of God into the Camp</HI> to Save 'em, and received it with <HI>Shouting</HI> in their vain Confidence: So also when <HI>David</HI> was flying before <HI>Absalom, Zadock</HI> and the <HI>Le∣vites</HI> were for bearing away the Ark of the Co∣venant of God, as a Pledge of the Divine Pre∣sence and Assistance with the Afflicted King; but his Care of it, and Reverence to it, was too
<PB N="5" REF="001294_0007_0FB27C0ACFFE9AC0"/>great to suffer it, and he had a more just appre∣hension of a right Trust in God, then to build meerly on the outward sign of Gods Presence and Power.</P>
<P>The <HI>other Sense</HI> is in words expressed: <HI>Let God arise, and let his Enemies be scattered, let them also that hate him flee before him.</HI> This is the Express <HI>Reason</HI> of the Petition, that the Enemies of God might be put to Confusion and Flight, be bro't to Ruine and Destruction upon his <HI>Arising.</HI></P>
<P>Observe here, <HI>That the Enemies and Haters of God are One;</HI> and so likewise are the Enemies of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> One: those that hate his <HI>Church</HI> hate <HI>him,</HI> and 'tis a most Consolatory Cosidera∣tion that the Great GOD holds 'em to do so.</P>
<P>Yet note, that they are considered here as <HI>Gods Enemies,</HI> and not <HI>Ours</HI> personally: The E∣nemies of his Name and Glory, his Truth and Cause, his Church and Kingdom, and that Im∣placably; <HI>As such,</HI> Vengeance is here impreca∣ted on them, and against such we may &amp; ought to pray: 'Tis <HI>best</HI> to carry 'em to God, &amp; leave 'em to his Judgments written against 'em.</P>
<P>And you cannot but remark the high <HI>Devo∣tion</HI> &amp; flaming <HI>Zeal,</HI> which this Prayer breathes: Such a Zeal for Gods Honour, and such Love to his Interest and People, as God who is here invok'd is wont Himself to express. And what a <HI>Noble Trust</HI> and Dependance on God alone is here express'd! <HI>Let God arise!</HI> they look to Him, they build on his Appearing for them, and not
<PB N="6" REF="001294_0008_0FB27C0D25A544A0"/>on any <HI>Arm of Flesh. Finally,</HI> The words speak a most glorious <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Confidence; Let God a∣rise, let his Enemies be scattered, i. e.</HI> Let God a∣rise and they <HI>will</HI> be so, they <HI>shall</HI> be so, there needs nothing more to discomfit 'em: and so indeed the <HI>Hebrew</HI> runs, in the <HI>Future Tense.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have as <HI>briefly</HI> as I cou'd <HI>fully,</HI> set this Copious Prayer in its true Light: You easily see how fruitful it is of Noble &amp; Divine <HI>Truths,</HI> and how many rich <HI>Observations</HI> I might offer from it; I shall select <HI>One</HI> only, the plain <HI>scope</HI> of the <HI>Text,</HI> and what I designed in the Choice of it: Namely,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That the People of God ought by Earnest &amp; Fervent Prayer to be seeking to Him for the Over∣throw and Destruction of His and His Churches Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>PRAYER is our <HI>Duty,</HI> and our rich <HI>Priviledge</HI> in all Cases and Circumstances whatsoever. We <HI>owe</HI> this to God, and His Honour calls for it; we <HI>need</HI> it our selves, and 'tis an unspeakable Favour, Mercy and Advantage to us. The Command is, Eph. 6.18. <HI>Pray always with all Prayer, &amp; Supplication in the Spirit, watching there∣unto with all perseverance:</HI> Phil. 4.6. <HI>In every thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prayer and Supplication with Thanksgiving, let your Requests be made known unto God.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis what the <HI>Saints</HI> have always <HI>abounded</HI> in: from <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>David,</HI> from <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Elias,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001294_0009_0FB27C0E8ED19058"/>from Him to <HI>Daniel, &amp;c.</HI> And above all out <HI>Blessed Saviour</HI> has taught it to his Church for ever, both in repeated <HI>Precepts</HI> and his own Heavenly <HI>Practice.</HI> A most Reasonable Duty to the Great <HI>God</HI> and our Merciful <HI>Redeemer!</HI> Whose we are, Who gave us Being, in whom we live, on whom we depend, from whom we receive all that we have, all that we can have, &amp; more than we know of! (Who <HI>is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,</HI> Eph. 3.20.) To whom we are by our <HI>Baptism</HI> devoted and consecrated, being bought with a <HI>Price,</HI> the <HI>precious Blood of Christ,</HI> who also is our <HI>Advocate,</HI> and ever lives to present our Prayers.</P>
<P><HI>Prayer</HI> is the least <HI>Acknowledgment</HI> that can be of God, his Providence, his Written Word, and all Spiritual Blessings in <HI>Christ;</HI> and the least <HI>Testimony</HI> we can give of a Religious Reverence &amp; Veneration toward Him; of Gratitude, Love, Trust and Submission to Him; and surely there can be no more meet and proper, or Nobler Use of <HI>Speech,</HI> which Faculty is given us for this End, to utter aloud the devout Motions &amp; Re∣sentments of our Minds, in way of Homage to the Great GOD, and for His Honour &amp; Glory.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Fervency</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.26, Col. 4.12. St. Luk. 22.44. 1 Thes. 3.10.</NOTE> must accompany all our Prayers, if we expect they shou'd be acceptable and Prevalent. St. <HI>James</HI> puts these two toge∣ther,
<PB N="8" REF="001294_0010_0FB27C10C411FE00"/>Jam. 5.16. <HI>The Effectual Fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man availeth much:</HI> And the <HI>Psalmist</HI> sayes, <HI>With my whole heart have I fought thee,</HI>—<HI>I entreated thy Favour with my whole heart,</HI> Ps. 119. 10.18. This is but decent and necessary, because the <HI>Object</HI> to whom we address in Prayer is the Most <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Holy</HI> GOD, whose Name is <HI>Glo∣rious and Fearful,</HI> and before whom the <HI>Serephims cover their Faces!</HI> Tis an awful thing to have to do with the Supream <HI>Majesty</HI> of Heaven and Earth! we shou'd not dare to trifle with Him! Moreover, The <HI>things we ask</HI> in Prayer are of the last <HI>Weight and Importance,</HI> and if we have a pressing sense of our <HI>Needs,</HI> and a real <HI>Desire</HI> of the Blessings we request, we cannot but be ear∣nest and servent in Spirit. In a word, Prayer is a Sacred Exercise of great seriousness and so∣lemnity, and nothing can be more Indecent &amp; Criminal than a light and common, a cold and indifferent frame of Spirit in it; But the Mind ought to be Intent, Desire Strong, the Affections vigorously moving, Grace in its lively Exercise, and then (like <HI>Israel</HI>) we <HI>Wrestle</HI> with God and <HI>as a Prince</HI> we do <HI>prevail.</HI></P>
<P>This I cou'd not but hint of <HI>Prayer in General,</HI> and now have the same thing to observe and make good of that particular <HI>Branch</HI> of Prayer, the <HI>Imprecation</HI> of Judgment upon the Enemies of God. I shall therefore show, that this is <HI>one Part of Prayer,</HI> and that we ought to be <HI>Earnest and Fervent</HI> in these Addresses to God.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="001294_0011_0FB27C1246802F40"/>
I. <HI>Imprecation of Judgment on the wicked Ene∣mies of God and his Church is one part of Prayers;</HI> &amp;c we ought to make it <HI>one Article</HI> in our Petitions, that God wou'd blast their Designs &amp; Attempts against his Truths, and Wayes, and Interest, confound their wicked Counsels, Scatter 'em in their evil Enterprizes, bring down their Power and Pride, and execute the Judgments written against them. We have many <HI>Examples</HI> of this part of Prayer in the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. 5.10, 7, 6.9.59, 13.69.24. &amp;c. 79.10, 11, 125.5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> especially in the <HI>Book of Psalms:</HI> I will mention two only, Psal. 94.1, 2. <HI>O Lord God, to whom Vengeance be∣longeth, O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thy self! Lift up thy self thou Judge of the Earth, render a Reward to the Proud! Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</HI> &amp;c. Psal. 83.1, 2. <HI>Keep not thou silence O God: hold not thy peace and be not still, O God. For lo, thine Enemies make a tumult, &amp; they that hate thee have lift up the head.</HI>— v. 13, 15, &amp;c. <HI>O my God, make them like a Wheel: as the stubble before the Wind.—So persecute 'em with thy Tempest, and make 'em afraid with thy Storm.— Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let 'em be put to shame, and perish.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it be said, that these Prayers do not <HI>agree to the Spirit of Christianity.</HI> They did agree to the Unequal'd Meekness of <HI>Moses,</HI> &amp; to the exalted Devotion of <HI>David:</HI> Nay they do agree
<PB N="10" REF="001294_0012_0FB27C151DF9F340"/>with the Goodness of that Frame, which we are sure the <HI>Blessed Spirits</HI> in Heaven are always in; for so <HI>the Souls of them that</HI> are <HI>Slain for the Word of God,</HI> are represented to be <HI>crying with a loud Voice,</HI> Rev. 6.10. <HI>How long, O Lord, Holy &amp; True, dost thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth!</HI> And thus the <HI>Divine</HI> heard the <HI>Angel of the Waters say,</HI> Rev. 16.5, 6. <HI>Thou art Righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus: For they have shed the Blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</HI> Now if both Prayers and Praises are utter'd on this ac∣count in Heaven above, are they not decent and becoming, and agreeable to pure Religion, in the Church here below?</P>
<P>But you will expect that I do both <HI>state and limit</HI> this point, and then offer something in <HI>Proof</HI> of it. Take then a few <HI>Rules</HI> about pray∣ing against others, even the most wicked Ene∣mies of God, and then a few <HI>Reasons</HI> to prove it to be lawful, decent and necessary.</P>
<P>First, <HI>The Rules,</HI> which we ought to govern our selves by in this Case, are such as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. We must be sure that we do <HI>simply consider 'em as Gods Enemies and not our Own,</HI> and that there be no private Grudge on personal accounts. For this wou'd spoil our Prayers, and be an Asking God to gratify our private <HI>Spleens,</HI> which he abominates in us. Therefore we must na∣kedly confider those, whom we pray against,
<PB N="11" REF="001294_0013_0FB27C174CFC3FD0"/>as the Publick Enemies of Gods Truth and Ho∣ly Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. We must therefore <HI>be sure that we can prove 'em to be so,</HI> before we venture to pray against 'em. This will put restraint upon a <HI>hasty Zeal,</HI> which is apt to mistake, and to judge them whom Christ receives. 'Twill also manifest a due sense of our Ignorance and <HI>Fallibility;</HI> and prevent many a bitter Reflection, full of shame and sorrow, the certain fruit and punishment of Vain-Confidence and Criminal Rashness. I wish that all <HI>Parties among Protestants</HI> wou'd se∣riously lay this <HI>Rule</HI> to heart, lest in the Inte∣grity and Honesty of their Hearts they run into the <HI>Disciple</HI>'s Error, Luk. 9.49. <HI>Master, we saw one casting out Devils in thy Name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not us. And Jesus said, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us, is for us.</HI> You must observe, that <HI>Moses</HI> in the first Use of our <HI>Text,</HI> pray'd against those Enemies and <HI>Nations,</HI> whom he know God had devoted to destruction, and whom <HI>Israel</HI> were going to root out, and take possession of their Land: And a like Warrant we have to pray against the <HI>Romish Antichrist,</HI> the Daughter of Babylon that is to be destroyed.</P>
<P N="3">3. However sure we are that a <HI>Person</HI> or <HI>Par∣ty</HI> do deserve the Judgments and Rebukes of Heaven, as Publick Enemies of the true Wayes of God, yet if there has been any thing of <HI>Per∣sonal.</HI> Opposition, Contests, Affronts Wrongs
<PB N="12" REF="001294_0014_0FB27C1DC5D26AE0"/>either given or received, <HI>Be sparing, suspicious, and lay Restraint upon thy self:</HI> Dare not to trust thy own heart, where 'tis so easily partial and byassed, lest Regards to <HI>self</HI> are blended with those to Heaven, and Heaven be dishonour'd and offended. And if men are apt to justifie and guide themselves by the <HI>Psalmists</HI> Example in this Case <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>As</HI> Psalm 7.35.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.55.59.69.70.109, &amp;c.</NOTE>, we must know that as we have not his <HI>Grace,</HI> so much less have we his Infalli∣ble Guidance and <HI>Inspiration,</HI> to safe-guard and warrant us. Mr. <HI>Vincent</HI> therefore tells us, <Q>That <HI>David</HI> and the other <HI>Prophets</HI> are no Examples for us to follow in this matter, for they knew by a Prophetick Spirit Gods In∣tentions concerning the Persons whom they prayed against.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. We must be sure <HI>that it be not from a Spirit of Cruelty,</HI> nor from any <HI>want of Charity and Com∣passion,</HI> nor from a <HI>delight in the Griefs and Ruine</HI> of any of our Fellow-Creatures, that we Impre∣cate Judgments on them. When we are <HI>forc'd</HI> into it, it shou'd be only from a sense of Duty to God, and what we owe unto His Honour, Cause and Members: It must not be from Ill-will to men: it shou'd be from a grieved Spirit, that the Wickedness of men necessitates it, that men will bring down the Wrath of Heaven on their own Heads, and will not live in Holiness,
<PB N="13" REF="001294_0015_0FB27C240CBD6DC8"/>and in Peace, and be happy. And then we do <HI>Imprecate</HI> in a Gracious Spirit, like that where∣with the Good God does <HI>Inflict</HI> Judgment, <HI>Who does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of men.</HI> So the <HI>Prophet</HI> cou'd denounce the Judg∣ments of God against <HI>Moab</HI> in the Spirit of ten∣der affliction for her, Isa. 16.11. <HI>My Bowels shall sound like an Harp for Moab, and mine In∣ward parts for Kir-haresh.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. When we pray against the Enemies of God, <HI>some</HI> have tho't it shou'd rather be for "their <HI>Restraint</HI> than for their <HI>Hurt,</HI> but to be sure it shou'd be for their <HI>Conviction and Conver∣sion, rather than Destruction.</HI> We shou'd pray for their Repentance, and Recovery from the Er∣ror of their Wayes, and from their bloody Counsels: that God wou'd Enlighten their Minds and turn their Hearts: that the <HI>Light</HI> from Heaven might <HI>Strike them to the Ground,</HI> and the <HI>Scales fall off</HI> from their <HI>Eyes:</HI> that if it please God he wou'd yet use 'em, as he did Perse∣cuting <HI>Saul,</HI> to be eminently Serviceable to the Truths which they destroy: And <HI>finally,</HI> that God wou'd even <HI>judge</HI> 'em with this merciful Intention, as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> pray'd of old, Psal. 83.16. <HI>Fill their Faces with shame, that they may seek thy Name, O Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Vengeance must <HI>not</HI> be <HI>Absolutely</HI> impreca∣ted on any, <HI>but on supposition of their Implacable Malignity</HI> against God, which God only knows; or where he has <HI>Revealed</HI> it to be so, and has
<PB N="14" REF="001294_0016_0FB27C250AF3D540"/>expressly <HI>devoted unto destruction:</HI> As we know that the <HI>Great Whore</HI> and <HI>Mother of Abominations</HI> is; As to which Accursed Interest in general therefore, Charity and Pity are shut out for E∣ver.</P>
<P N="7">7. And <HI>Lastly,</HI> In all such Prayers against the Enemies of God and His Church, <HI>we must pre∣serve a perfect Submission</HI> to the Will and Good Pleasure of God; leaving it to Him to judge in <HI>his own Time Way and Manner,</HI> not daring to <HI>prescribe</HI> our Tho'ts to Him, nor pretend to be <HI>privy</HI> to His; <HI>When, Where</HI> or <HI>How</HI> His Decrees shall take place, be bro't about or effected. All this we must for Ever submit to God in <HI>Adoring Manner,</HI> with humble and contented Minds: 'Tis eno' for us assuredly to Believe that <HI>His Day</HI> is coming, that the <HI>Vision</HI> is for an appoint∣ed time and will not tarry, and to have Hearts to pray with Earnestness and Joy, <HI>Even so Come, Lord Jesus! Come quickly!</HI></P>
<P>Such <HI>Rules</HI> as these we ought to go by in praying against the Enemies of God and of His Church. I pass,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To name some <HI>Reasons and Argu∣ments,</HI> which do prove it <HI>Lawful and Decent, Necessary and a Duty</HI> to pray against 'em.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is a proper and fitting Expression of Zeal a∣gainst Sin and Errer. These</HI> are found among the Enemies &amp; Haters of God; the Habitations of <HI>Ignorance and Cruelty</HI> are there. Here are <HI>Cor∣ruptions</HI> cherish'd, maintain'd and defended:
<PB N="15" REF="001294_0017_0FB27C272E5D2FB8"/>Here <HI>Impostures</HI> are hatch'd, vended and vindica∣ted: Here the <HI>Truth</HI> is blaspheem'd and out∣rag'd; damnable <HI>Heresies</HI> are furiously propa∣gated by Violence and Force; the <HI>Blood of Saints</HI> thirsted after and greedily drank down: Hence come the <HI>Discords,</HI> Confusions and <HI>Wars</HI> in the Earth; they come of <HI>Mens Lusts,</HI> and Errors Originally of Hell, <HI>Adopted</HI> and carefully nurs'd up by the <HI>Romish Apostacy,</HI> Her fruitful, Spurious, acknowledg'd <HI>Issue.</HI> The Death of these we ought to seek, the Extirpation of Er∣ror and of Lust, which destroy mens Souls, dis∣honour God, and turn the World upside down. Surely we shou'd pray for a stop to be put to such <HI>Guilts! O let the wickedness of the Wicked come to an End, but establish the Just!—For her Sins have reached unto Heaven, and God hath re∣membred her Iniquities;—therefore shall her Plagues come in one day—.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is but a meet Expression of Love to the Church and Members of Christ in the World.</HI> The Church's Preservation, defence and safety, Establishment and Inlargement, Purity and Reformation, Peace and Tranquility, Comfort and Joy, do depend on the Judgment of its implacable Ene∣mies. Their fall is the Church's Security and Triumph, <HI>Rejoice over her, thou Heaven, and ye Ho∣ly Apostle and Prophets!</HI> the <HI>Persecuted Saints</HI> are herein deliver'd, honour'd and Avenged; to <HI>Them</HI> we owe our first and superiour Love, next unto what we owe to the LORD Himself, nay
<PB N="16" REF="001294_0018_0FB27C2815EABF90"/>he reckons it to Himself, and it is our Love to His Name and Glory. For <HI>Zions sake</HI> there∣fore we shou'd <HI>not hold our peace, and for Jerusa∣lems sake</HI> we shou'd <HI>not rest, until the Righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp</HI> that <HI>burneth.</HI> Isai. 62.1. This was a strong <HI>Motive</HI> to the <HI>Psalmist</HI> in the <HI>Con∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> v. 2, 3. <HI>As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the Fire, so let the wicked perish at the Presence of God:</HI> BUT <HI>let the Righteous be glad, let 'em rejoyce before God, yea let them exceedingly rejoyce.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And Lastly, <HI>The Glory of God, and of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is greatly consulted in such Prayers.</HI> The Glory of the <HI>Being and Providence</HI> of God is so: for by <HI>this</HI> it appears terribly to a wicked and Infidel World, that there is a God, and that <HI>Zions</HI> God reigns; that <HI>Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous, verily he is a God who judgeth in the Earth! and that He whose Name a∣lone is Jehovah is the Most High over all the Earth!</HI> v. 4. <HI>Extol him that rideth upon the Heavens by his Name</HI> JAH, <HI>and rejoyce before Him.</HI></P>
<P>God has the Glory of his <HI>Holiness and Justice,</HI> and his Holy <HI>Angels</HI> laud him for Ever, saying, —<HI>They are Worthy!</HI> And of His <HI>Truth,</HI> both in his Promises and his Threatnings, <HI>Even so, Lord God Almighty! true and Righteous are thy Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>It is to the Great Glory of Divine <HI>Power:</HI> especially when these Enemies of God are High and Mighty upon Earth, and they are never∣theless
<PB N="17" REF="001294_0019_0FB27C2987FDEDD0"/>made to know that there is a God a∣bove them: So God gets Himself a <HI>Name</HI> on a haughty <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> a blaspheeming <HI>Senecharib,</HI> and a vaunting <HI>Nebuchadnezzar;</HI> He makes the <HI>One</HI> to know—<HI>Who is the Lord,</HI> and puts a <HI>hook into the</HI> Others <HI>Nose,</HI> and causes <HI>the Virgin, the Daugh∣ter of Zion, to despise him, to laugh him to scorn, &amp; to shake the head at him;</HI> &amp; the <HI>Last</HI> He humbles, and forces to confess that there is <HI>A Most High,</HI> the <HI>King of Heaven,</HI> to <HI>Praise, Extol &amp; Honour</HI> Him, whose <HI>Dominion is Everlasting,</HI> all whose <HI>Works</HI> are <HI>Truth,</HI> and His <HI>Ways Judgment,</HI> &amp; those that walk in <HI>Pride He is able to abase.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, God has the Glory of his <HI>Compas∣sion and Mercy</HI> to His Church: <HI>He confirms his In∣heritance when it is weary,—and prepares of his Goodness for the poor.</HI> v. 9, 10.</P>
<P>Finally, <HI>The Wisdom</HI> of God is sure to shine forth Gloriously: <HI>Mysterious Wisdom,</HI> in defeat∣ing the deep Polices, craft and subtilty of man, turning their Counsels backward, and taking them in their own <HI>Snares!</HI> Surprizing his Church with Salvations in Unexpected Way and Man∣ner! snatch'd from <HI>among the pots,</HI> v. 13. and on a sudden rais'd &amp; beautify'd <HI>as the Wings of a Dove cover'd with Silver, &amp; her Feathers with yellow Gold.</HI></P>
<P>For these <HI>plain Reasons</HI> we ought to be seeking to God in Prayer for the Overthrow and De∣struction of His &amp; his Church's Enemies: <HI>these</HI> are the <HI>Ends</HI> of such Prayers, the proper <HI>Mo∣tives</HI> to 'em, and what do justifie us in 'em; not
<PB N="18" REF="001294_0020_0FB27C2BC79F89C0"/>only arguing 'em to be lawful and decent, but a Duty and of necessity. And the same <HI>Reasons</HI> do oblige us.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Unto Fervency and Earnestness in such parts of Prayer;</HI> which shou'd have been the <HI>Second Ge∣neral Head of Discourse,</HI> the <HI>Text</HI> breathing a very sensible <HI>Zeal and Flame;</HI> as also the <HI>Elect, whom God will avenge,</HI> are said to <HI>Cry day and night.</HI> If we shou'd not be Zealous against <HI>Sin,</HI> and in Earnest when the <HI>Glory</HI> of God lies at stake, and if we ought not to be hearty and fervent in Love to Christ and his Interest, what shou'd Inspire us to be so?</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>The Enemies of Christ &amp; of his Church are zealous in their Opposition and Enmity.</HI> Zealous in their Idolatrous <HI>Invocations,</HI> and in numbring their Ridiculous Prayers, like the <HI>Priests of Baal</HI> in <HI>Elijahs</HI> time, who together with their <HI>Antick Gestures,</HI> and <HI>bloody Rites,</HI> held their <HI>Yell</HI> from Morning to Evening, <HI>O Baal, hear us!</HI> Furious (like <HI>Jezabel,</HI> their Patroness) in hatred of the Truth, and persecuting the Prophets of the Lord to Death, to exterminate pure Worship from the Earth! So zealous (it may be) as to bind themselves with <HI>detested Vows,</HI> and take the <HI>Sacrament</HI> on it that they will imbrew their hands in Blood! Surely then we shou'd find Zeal too, and be <HI>very Jealous for the Lord God of Hosts,</HI> for his People, and our Holy Religion; and against the Spirit of <HI>Antichrist</HI> and all its <HI>A∣bominations!</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001294_0021_0FB27C2D45E8F468"/>A manly, rational, meek Divine Zeal shou'd put us on praying, and the <HI>Lord</HI> wou'd <HI>answer by fire,</HI> and burn up his Enemies.</P>
<P>USE. I will <HI>Improve</HI> the <HI>Doctrine</HI> in a few <HI>devout and practical Reflections.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. If Imprecation shou'd be made against the wicked Enemies of God and his Church, in Solemn Prayer unto God, we learn thence <HI>how Prophane it is to use this Mode of Speech on light and trivial Causes, how horrid and cruel it is to make our Neighbours the Objects of 'em, and how Unnatu∣ral and Monstrous a thing 'tis to make them against our selves.</HI> The least that can be said of it in either of these Cases is, that 'tis a profane <HI>Ta∣king the Name of God in vain:</HI> But one wou'd never guess it, if 'twere not so often prov'd, that men cou'd turn a thing so Awful and Solemn into a Jest and Play, nor dare to direct the <HI>Poin∣ted Lightning</HI> to their own heads, or wish it on their Neighbours. Yet this vile Use do men too often make of <HI>Imprecation,</HI> sometimes wan∣tonly, sometimes maliciously, always prophanely.</P>
<P><HI>Some</HI> cruelly &amp; unnaturally Imprecate against <HI>their own Souls,</HI> on trivial Causes and in a strange kind of Jest &amp; Sport, wishing <HI>damnation</HI> to them∣selves every day they live! the <HI>only Prayer</HI> they ever make it may be! Others in Vexation and discontent do the same to their <HI>Limbs or Life;</HI> &amp; God, whose holy Name is impiously profan'd.
<PB N="20" REF="001294_0022_0FB27C2F77922688"/>hears their hideous Wishes, and sometimes judici∣ally <HI>seals</HI> and affixes an <HI>Amen</HI> to 'em, saying, Yes, Profane man, equally an hater of thy self and Me, inherit the wish'd Curse.</P>
<P>Sometimes men bestow their direful Impreca∣tions <HI>on Others,</HI> sportively very often, and often from passion and sudden wrath, and too often from a bitter Malignity, and Implacable hatred of their Persons. A Crime that Christianity ut∣terly detests, whatever our Provocations may be, strictly requiring us to <HI>love our Enemies</HI> and <HI>for∣give men their trespasses, to bless them that curse us, and to pray for them that despitefully use us.</HI> Ro. 12.14. <HI>Bless them which persecute you, bless and curse not.</HI> Not but that we may have a sorrowful Re∣sentment of Wrongs, and may go to God, with whom 'tis best to leave our selves and others.—<HI>I Mourn in my complaint and make a noise, because of the Voice of the Enemy, because of the Oppression of the Wicked; for they cast Iniquity upon me, &amp; in Wrath they hate me.—They curse inwardly: My Soul, wait then only upon God, for my Expectation is from Him.—Do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy Names take: because thy Mercy is Good, deliver thou me.—That they may know that this is thy Hand, that thou, Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> done it: let them curse, but bless Thou!</HI>—</P>
<P>Sometimes these barbarous and bloody <HI>Exe∣crations</HI> have put on the <HI>Reverend Face of Sanctity</HI> and Religion, &amp; Zeal for God &amp; His Truth: &amp; so the Men of one <HI>Party, Sect</HI> and <HI>Opinion</HI> in Re∣ligion have, with much solemnity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pretended
<PB N="21" REF="001294_0023_0FB27C3103FB2A40"/>Devotion, <HI>Anathematiz'd</HI> and damn'd all that dif∣fer from 'em. This has been peculiarly the Guilt of <HI>Rome:</HI> And we shou'd learn to <HI>spue out this Le∣ven,</HI> for 'tis very apt to <HI>taint</HI> us in our Disaffec∣tions to one another, even where men agree in all the Fundamentals of Religion; whence it is that <HI>so many Thousands stand Excommunicate</HI> in mens Tho'ts and on <HI>Records,</HI> whom the Lord Jesus Christ will own and embrace.</P>
<P>Indeed there was <HI>among the Jews a Form of Ad∣juration or Imprecation,</HI> scil. GOD DO SO, AND MORE ALSO. The most Eminent Saints us'd it, but in a devout and awful manner, &amp; upon weighty and serious Occasions: And so us'd, it was properly a part of Religion, as much as the taking an <HI>Oath</HI> is when we are called to it; for <HI>this</HI> also is a solemn Appeal unto God, and a <HI>ta∣cit Invoking his holy Vengeance</HI> in case of Falshood, which Vengeance does therefore follow Perju∣ry. So (I say) Imprecation was of old used as an Act of Religion &amp; Worship, in devout man∣ner. Thus <HI>Eli</HI> adjur'd <HI>Samuel,</HI> 1 Sam. 3.17. <HI>God do so to thee, &amp; more also, if thou hide any thing from me</HI>—.So <HI>Ruth</HI> unto <HI>Naomi: The Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee &amp; me,</HI> In this manner <HI>David</HI> once &amp; again <HI>Sware</HI> &amp; bound himself <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 3 35.19.13.</NOTE> and so <HI>Solomon sware by the Lord,</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE> <HI>saying, God do so to to me and more also, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="22" REF="001294_0024_0FB27C36EE7CECB8"/>have not spoken against his own life:</HI> &amp; St. <HI>Paul</HI> with like Solemnity <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 1.23.</NOTE> asserts his Veracity by <HI>calling God to Record on his Soul.</HI> These <HI>Instances</HI> show that the thing is <HI>Good, if it be used lawfully.</HI></P>
<P>But as every act of Religion may be abus'd and profan'd, and then looks horrid, so do pro∣fane Imprecations more especially; it is so Inso∣lent and daring a Dishonour to the Name and Authority of God. Yet good Men have some∣times rashly fallen into it, but have deeply re∣pented of it, as <HI>David</HI> did of his passionate Re∣solve against <HI>Nabal:</HI> 1 Sam. 25.22. <HI>So and more also do God unto the Enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the Morning light:</HI> but there follows a full proof of his Repenting of those <HI>blooly Words,</HI> v. 32, 33. where he <HI>blesses God,</HI> and blesses <HI>Abigail,</HI> that he was <HI>kept from shedding blood and from avenging himself.</HI></P>
<P>But how many Graceless Creatures are there, who make a Trade of this and other Acts of Pro∣phaness, and repent not, nor do their hearts seem to smite 'em. I might produce many dire <HI>Ex∣amples</HI> out of <HI>History,</HI> of Persons who have been dreadfully punish'd by God, as they have wish'd against themselves in their cruel Passions: But there is one Select and terrible <HI>Scripture Instance,</HI> which alone I will leave with you to think of; and the rather to let you see of what kind of <HI>Per∣son</HI> this Impiety might be expected; and how severe and exact Heaven is to fulfil and perform
<PB N="23" REF="001294_0025_0FB27C3E5C416600"/>the cursed Wish. Let <HI>Jezebel</HI> be the Instance (<HI>that Woman Jezebel,</HI> "the <HI>Type</HI> of the <HI>Romish Whore, drunk with the Blood of Saints</HI>) of whom we read, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 19.1, 2. that when <HI>Ahab</HI> told her <HI>all that Elijah had done,</HI> (how he had encounter'd the <HI>Priests of Baal,</HI> expos'd 'em, and at his order the convinced Multitude had in their zeal slain 'em) this inrag'd Woman <HI>then sent a Messenger un∣to him saying, So let the gods do to me and more also, if I make not thy life, as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The like Instance we have, a King 6.31. Act 23.14.</NOTE>. Thus she imprecated against her own Life: Words worthy of her lewd Mouth, and agreable to her outrageous and bloody Spirit! And in a little time God did to her as she had wish'd, and <HI>more also</HI> than what she had threat'ned <HI>Elijah,</HI> &amp; than he had done to her Idolatrous <HI>Priests;</HI> for she was not <HI>Slain barely,</HI> but in <HI>an uncommon way and manner,</HI> being thrown out of a <HI>Window;</HI> dasht to death on the Pavement, <HI>trodden under foot, and eaten of dogs.</HI> Well did <HI>Jehu</HI> call her the <HI>Cursed Woman!</HI> Curs'd from her own Mouth, and the Curse confirm'd by the God of Heaven, who heard and executed what her lips had utter'd.</P>
<P><HI>In short,</HI> let us learn to abhor this Savage Spi∣rit, which pure Religion bids the last Defyance to; it being <HI>equally void of Reverence to God</HI> or <HI>Mercy to Men,</HI> equally against <HI>Nature</HI> &amp; against <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="001294_0026_0FB27C4534FD0488"/>
II. <HI>Here is a Serious and Affectionate Call to Prayer, for our People, and Churches, and for the In∣terest of Christ in the World.</HI> For what is it to Pray against the Church's Enemies, but to be lifting up a Prayer for the Church it self? 'Tis in effect the same thing, and they are mutually imply'd in each other. The same Reasons and Argu∣ments incite equally to either, and therefore the proper <HI>Inference</HI> &amp; <HI>Exhortation</HI> from the preceding <HI>Discourse</HI> is this, <HI>Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem!</HI> Psal. 122.7, 8, 9. <HI>Peace be within thy Walls, and Prosperity within thy Palaces. For my Brethren and Companions sake I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the House of the Lord our God, I will seek thy Good.</HI> So in the same Breath wherein the <HI>Psalmist</HI> prayes, <HI>Remember,</HI> O <HI>Lord, the Children of Edom,</HI> he took special care himself not to for∣get <HI>Jerusalem, If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her Cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy.</HI></P>
<P>Millions of Prayers are daily going up to God from his Church, in every part of the World, a∣gainst his Enemies; and such hands as <HI>Moses</HI> held up High and Steadily in the <HI>Mount,</HI> and hearts like his breathing out <HI>this Short Petition,</HI> wou'd utterly scatter every <HI>Amaleck,</HI> and put the Haters of the Lord to a perpetual Rout. God has fulfill'd his gracious <HI>Promise,</HI> and has set <HI>Watchmen upon Jeru∣salems Walls, who do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hold their Peace, day nor night:</HI> Isa. 62.6, 7. <HI>Ye that make mention of the
<PB N="25" REF="001294_0027_0FB27C4611A32AD0"/>Lord keep not Silence, and give Him no Rest, till He establish, &amp; till He make Jerusalem a Praise in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Salvations receiv'd shou'd be lookt upon at Answers given unto Prayer, and demand Returns of Solemn Praise and Thanksgiving.</HI> When God has <HI>Risen</HI> up and smote his Enemies, our Prayers a∣gainst them are Answer'd, our Petition is given us; as indeed of late years the Church's Prayers have been most signally, <HI>in a Series of great Successes and wonderful Victories</HI> over the <HI>Powers</HI> of the <HI>Beast;</HI> and I need look no further than our <HI>Con∣text</HI> for the proper Acknowledgments &amp; Thank∣ful Praises, which such gracious Answers of Pray∣er shou'd constrain from us: v. 11, 12. <HI>The Lord gave the Word, Great was the Company of those that Publish'd it. Kings of Armies did flee apace, and she that tarry'd at home divided the spoil.</HI> v. 26. <HI>Bless ye God in the Congregations, even the Lord from the Fountain of Israel.</HI> v. 28. <HI>Thy God hath commanded thy strength; strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wro't for us.</HI> v. 32, 33, &amp;c. <HI>Sing unto God, O ye Kingdoms of the Earth; O Sing Praises unto the Lord, Selah: To Him that rideth upon the Heavens of Hea∣vens, which were of old; Lo, He doth send out his Voice, and that a Mighty Voice. Ascribe ye strength unto God: His Excellency is over Israel, and His strength is in the Clouds. O God, thou art Terrible out of thy holy Places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his People: Blessed be God.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="26" REF="001294_0028_0FB27C492DDF2DE8"/>
IV. If we may Pray against the Enemies of God and his Church, for their Overthrow and Destruction, <HI>Then also we may Seek and Endeavour their ruin and downfal in</HI> LAWFUL WAR. 'Tis you see what we can Pray over, and may trust in God for his Blessing on. For tho' Christiani∣ty abhors the Principle of Propagating the Truth by Force of Arms; or of making War on others because they are the avowed Enemies of God &amp; his Church; yet if thro' the over-ruling Provi∣dence of God we come to be in a just War with such, we may the more confidently hope that God will make it Subserve to his own Glory in their Overthrow, and we can plead before Him, that they are <HI>His Enemies,</HI> and Pray that He wou'd <HI>Arise and Scatter 'em.</HI></P>
<P>This gives the GOVERNMENT Confidence in their <HI>Councels</HI> against the <HI>Enemy,</HI> and heartens the Christian <HI>Souldiers</HI> in their <HI>Marches</HI> and <HI>En∣gagements;</HI> to be <HI>Strong</HI> and to <HI>Play the Men,</HI> for the People and Cities of their God; for as many Prayers are following 'em, So who knows what <HI>Arms</HI> God will use for the Fall of the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> against whom so many Prayers are continually ascending. What we may Pray for, we may also endeavour, at the plain and loud Call of Provi∣dence. The Psalmist wou'd have been glad to have us'd his <HI>Hands</HI> as well as <HI>Tongue,</HI> to have drawn his <HI>Sword</HI> as well as <HI>Pen,</HI> against Devoted <HI>Babylon: Psal.</HI> 137.8. O Daughter of Babylon, <HI>who art to be destroy'd! happy shall he be that reward∣eth thee as thou hast served us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001294_0029_0FB27C4A85E9A048"/>
And being that God has cast our day in a time of <HI>War</HI> with the <HI>Antichristian Enemy,</HI> I wou'd crave leave to offer this <HI>Comfortable Assurance</HI> to YOUR EXCELLENCY and the HONOU∣RABLE COURT, <HI>Your Officers and Troops;</HI> That we bear you in our Hearts, and on our Knees to God, and follow our <HI>Brethren</HI> in their weari∣some Marches, and thro' all their Dangers, with our earnest Cries to Heaven for their safe Con∣duct, Success, Victories, and a Triumphant Re∣turn. We also stand ready as our <HI>Office</HI> binds us, and <HI>Your whole praying People,</HI> bound by their <HI>Ho∣ly Profession,</HI> to ascribe and give the Glory to God of all his merciful Appearances with You, in blessing Your Councels and Enterprizes. We have an ARK to take up and bear before You, even the <HI>Exalted</HI> NAME of the <HI>Victorious</HI> RE∣DEEMER! We have a MERCY-SEAT to come before,—And we thank GOD on Your Behalf <HI>(the Fathers of the Congregation)</HI> who have lately call'd us to <HI>Enquire before it,</HI> for and with you <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>On a Day of Prayer at the Council Chamber in</HI> Boston, Fryday, March 7.17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>; Admonishing us herein of our <HI>Duty and Priviledge,</HI> if we cou'd have forgot it, &amp; leaving us a happy Testimony of Your own devout <HI>De∣pendance.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. And lastly, <HI>Let us be Caution'd and Directed to earnest Heed and Care, lest we be found our selves among the Enemies of a</HI> HOLY GOD, <HI>and so the Efficacy of our Prayers be hindred, and our Imprecati∣ons
<PB N="28" REF="001294_0030_0FB27C4C09F51280"/>turn'd at last against our selves.</HI> Let us be Ex∣horted to <HI>Universal Holiness</HI> and a <HI>General Refor∣mation;</HI> for if we regard Iniquity in our hearts, and retain it in practice, the Lord will not hear our Prayers, and the Scripture concludes us <HI>Ene∣mies to the Cross of Christ, whose End is Destruction!</HI> and then while we pray—<HI>So let thine Enemies pe∣rish, O Lord</HI>—, we forget that we Invoke upon our own Heads. For verily; Irreligion, Disobedi∣ence, Profaness or Hypocrisie are equally En∣mity and Odious to God, as are corrupt Doct∣rine, Superstition, False Worship and bloody Principles adopted into Religion.</P>
<P>What great Difference is there, tho' there be <HI>Error and Impostures</HI> with our Enemies, and the <HI>Truth held in Unrighteousness</HI> with us! Worship <HI>Corrupted</HI> with them, and the <HI>pure</HI> Ordinances <HI>neglected</HI> or profaned by us! <HI>Idol Images</HI> with them, and <HI>Idol-lusts</HI> with us! more <HI>Bloodiness</HI> with them, but aggravated <HI>Immoralities</HI> of other kind with us! Aggravated (I say) under our superi∣our light and advantages! and stricter Bonds! Our Sins being more bold and insolent, base &amp; ungrateful, false and treacherous in the sight of Heaven than theirs.</P>

<P>It behoves us therefore to judge our selves this day before the <HI>Lord our God:</HI> Have we been a People faithful in his Holy Covenant? Or are we a penitent and reforming People? If not, what Confidence have we that God will hear and bless us? What Efficacy are our Pray∣ers like to have? What hurt will they do our Enemies, if we be as wicked as they? as <HI>barren</HI> under better <HI>Means,</HI> and as <HI>Cold</HI> and dead under more <HI>Awakenings!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Traitors</HI> that we are to God, to our selves, &amp; Countrey! We side with our Enemies in their ill designs upon us, by retaining our provoking Lusts! we betray and deliver up the Interest of Christ! we provoke God to forsake the Land, and the <HI>Ark will not save us!</HI> We show no real Regard to our Churches, nor to our <HI>Brethren in the Field!</HI> We blast our own Prayers, and che∣rish worse Enemies within us, than those that can invade us from without!</P>
<P>We must therefore put away the <HI>Accursed thing</HI> from among us, or our <HI>Trouble</HI> is from our selves, and <HI>God will trouble us.</HI> Let us be <HI>zeal us and repent.</HI> Especially lay out your <HI>Zeal</HI> against <HI>Im∣moralities,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="001294_0032_0FB27C4FC49DF608"/>and for <HI>Practical Godliness.</HI> Let us join heart and hand for <HI>Truth and Holiness,</HI> &amp; against the open <HI>Neglect,</HI> I had amost said <HI>Contempt,</HI> of Divine <HI>Institutions.</HI> Let us be Spirited [to re∣cover and establish <HI>Government</HI> in our Church∣es,] and to maintain a <HI>Godly and strict Discipline. Finally,</HI> Let our <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> see to the <HI>Execution</HI> of those good <HI>Laws,</HI> which we have against <HI>O∣pen Wickedness,</HI> and to provide for Religion and <HI>Literature</HI> in After-Generations; that there may be an Instructed and Godly Seed after us, excelling us, as They have done who are gone before us.</P>
<P>Then wou'd the LORD awake for our Help, and put our Enemies to a perpetual Reproach; the <HI>Haters</HI> of the Lord shou'd <HI>submit</HI> themselves, and our <HI>Time would be for ever!</HI> He would <HI>Set up his Taber∣nacle</HI> with us, and His <HI>Soul would not abhor us!</HI> He wou'd <HI>Walk among us, and be our God, and we shou'd be His People!</HI> The <HI>Cloud</HI> of his merciful Protection wou'd <HI>cover</HI> us, and <HI>rest</HI> over us! We might <HI>Set down the</HI> ARK of His Covenant, and say,—<HI>Return, O</HI> LORD, <HI>to the many Thousands of</HI> Israel! AMEN.</P>
