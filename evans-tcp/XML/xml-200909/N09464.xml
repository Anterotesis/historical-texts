<Q><BIBL><HI>JEREMIAH XXXI. 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>FOR thus saith the Lord, Sing with Gladness for Jacob, and shout among the Chief of the Nations: Publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy People, and the Remnant of Israel.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter, as in the foregoing, the Prophet foretells the Restoration of the Jews from the <HI>Babylonish</HI> seventy Years Captivity:—that they should return into their own Land, rebuild their Cities and Houses; plant their Vineyards, and eat the Fruits thereof, and be happily resettled in their former State of Freedom and Plenty; in which they should be adorned with signal Marks of the divine Favour, and all the Signs of religious and civil Joy— <HI>For thus saith the Lord, Sing with Gladness for Jacob,
<PB N="6" REF="012054_0004_0F896FCD37322468"/>and shout among the Chief of the Nations:</HI> &amp;c. when you see the Dawning of those blessed Times, express your Joy for the Restoration of Jacob's Posterity, in the most public Manner that can be, in the Sight of the Chiefest of those potent Nations, from whence you are to be delivered. <HI>Publish ye, Praise ye—</HI> Publish those good Tidings with the highest Expressi∣ons of Praise and Glory to God,—<HI>and say, O Lord, save thy People, the Remnant of Israel,</HI>—likewise pray earnestly that God, who hath begun so glorious a Work, would go on to complete and perfect it.</P>
<P>THE Words afford us this seasonable Instruction; <HI>That the joyful Praises of a People for Mercies recei∣ved, should be accompanied with fervent Prayers unto God to save them from Judgments which are still felt, or feared, by them.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Jews Deliverance from the Miseries of a long Captivity in Babylon was begun, in the first Steps of their Return from among the Nations which oppressed them, they were to <HI>sing for Gladness, and shout</HI> for Joy, to <HI>publish</HI> with the Voice of Praise and Thanksgivings the great Favour of God towards them: And at the same Time to pray with all Earnestness that God would still deliver his People from the Calamities they were yet under, or might expect to meet with in their Journey to, and after their Arrival in their own Land. And what the Lord said unto them in the Words of the Text, he speaketh unto us, and all the People of this Province; teaching us to observe this Day of public Thanksgiving as a Day of solemn Prayer also:—That while we sing for Gladness, and shout forth the Honour of God's Name, publishing with the Voice of Thanksgiving the Salvation, he hath
<PB N="7" REF="012054_0005_0F896FCDF747F270"/>shewed our Nation and the People of this Land, in the Course of the Year past, and praise him therefor, we likewise make this fervent Prayer unto him, <HI>O Lord, save thy People.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's Dispensations towards his People, and Mankind in general, to which we should accommodate our Devotions, are mixed of Mercies, and Judgments. In the Administrations of his moral Government He dispenseth both, in such Measure and Manner, as his Wisdom directeth his Justice and Goodness. The Condition of a People in this World is not at any Time altogether prosperous, nor quite desperate. Their State is usually such as is elegantly described by the Prophet, Zech. 14.6.7. <HI>It shall come to pass in that Day, that the Light shall not be clear nor dark. But it shall be one Day, which shall be known to the Lord, not Day nor Night: But it shall come to pass, that at Evening-time it shall be Light.</HI> Throughout the Day of Man's Life on Earth, the Light is neither clear nor dark—it is neither Day nor Night with him:—understanding by Light and Darkness, by Day and Night, Good and Evil. This is true of a People, during their continuance as such. Their Condition here is never perfectly and purely good, nor so throughly bad, as to be void of all Comfort. In Heaven the Light is clear, without any Darkness at all: In Hell there is the blackness of Darkness for ever. In Heaven it is all Day, <HI>there is no Night there;</HI> but nothing else in the Dungeon of Hell. But Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, Peace and Trouble, which are perfect and separate in the other World, are, in a lesser Degree of them blended in this. In this World there is a Day of Prosperity, and a Night of Adversity; and yet neither Day, nor Night:
<PB N="8" REF="012054_0006_0F896FCEB7692288"/>—Not a Day without <HI>the Evil of it,</HI> nor a Night of unallayed Affliction. Sometimes the Light may prevail above the Darkness, but does not wholly dispel it; sometimes the Darkness prevails above the Light, but doth not wholly exclude it. The brightest Day of Prosperity is not without Clouds, nor the darkest Night of Adversity without Gleams of Con∣solation. Good and Evil, as to the Degrees of them, succeed each other; and they are curiously interwoven into one Web, by the Art of divine Providence. So God tempereth his Dispensations, intermingles Com∣forts and Crosses, and the Work of his Providence is chequered.</P>
<P>To convince all, that <HI>verily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</HI> and engage our dutiful Regards to him, as the great, the wise, the just, and good Governor of the World, the Lord useth a Variety and Mixture of Dispensations towards Men in their present probationary State. In no other imaginable Way of dealing with such Creatures as we are, could there have been so suitable a Display of his glorious Perfecti∣ons, to excite our due Acknowledgment of him in this high Relation he sustaineth to us. If there were only Afflictions to be met with in this World, Sinners would have no Knowledge of the Goodness of God from his Providence, nor Invitations therefrom to Repentance. But he is <HI>the Lord that exerciseth Loving kindness in the Earth,</HI> and sheweth his Bounty to his offending Creatures, that they might be induced to remember and return to him He maketh his Sun to rise on the Evil and on the Good, and sendeth Rain on the Just and on the Unjust. He leaveth not him∣self without Witness to any, in that he giveth Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seasons, filling their Hearts
<PB N="9" REF="012054_0007_0F896FCF74E52340"/>with Food and Gladness. All the Gifts of God's common Bounty, which are promiscuously scattered abroad on every side, are so many Witnesses sent to attest the divine Care and Goodness, which leadeth Men to Repentance. And were it not for the <HI>Judg∣ments God executeth in the Earth,</HI> the Righteousness of his moral Government would not appear, and no ill Consequence of persisting impenitent in Wickedness would be dreaded by Men. Ps. 55.19. <HI>God shall both hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old: Because they have no Changes, therefore they fear not God.</HI> Uninterrupted Prosperity would banish all fear of God out of the World. God maketh himself known, as infinitely worthy of our highest Regards, by the Mercies and Judgments he dispenseth, according to his own Declaration, in Isai. 45.6.7. <HI>That they may know from the rising of the Sun, and from the West, that there is none besides me, I am the Lord, and there is none else: I form the Light, and create Darkness: I make Peace, and create Evil: I the Lord do all these Things.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent the Excesses which People are apt to run into in both States, prosperous and adverse, the Dispensations of Providence are mixed of Mercies and Judgments: That we might not surfeit on Prosperity, nor despond in Adversity,—wax wanton, nor become desperate. Did Men always enjoy a flourishing Pros∣perity, would they not be corrupted, and destroyed thereby? <HI>Jesurun</HI> waxed fat, and kicked:—then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his Salvation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. 32.15.</NOTE> Did they meet with no∣thing but Disappointment and Trouble, would they not be swallowed up of Sorrow? <HI>I had fainted,</HI> saith the Psalmist, <HI>unless I had believed to see the Goodness
<PB N="10" REF="012054_0008_0F896FD0FB58D348"/>of the Lord in the Land of the living.</HI> A Mixture therefore of providential Dispensations is necessary to prevent Mens being ruin'd by uninterrupted Prosperi∣ty, or overwhelm'd with perpetual Adversty: And to teach them Moderation in all things; <HI>to weep, as tho' they wept not; and to rejoice, as tho' they rejoiced not; and to use this World, as not abusing it, since the Fashion of it passeth away.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cor. 7.30, 31.</NOTE> God wisely dispenseth Good and Evil to Men, that they might not in their Prosperity say, their Mountain standeth strong, and they shall never be moved, but rejoice with trembling: Nor in their Adversity say, they shall never be deli∣vered, but hope still in God. The most prosperous Condition here is deficient in some Conveniences, and blended with some Troubles, that Men might not be excessive in their Rejoicings: And the most adverse Condition hath somewhat of Good in it, to compen∣sate for its Evils, and Hope lieth at the bottom of it, that they should not be immoderate in their Griefs. Some Evil there always is in our State on Earth, to shew that we are not past Danger: and some Good, to shew that we are not shut out from all Hope. As a wise Pilot taketh in so much Burthen, as will ballast the Ship, and not sink it: So in the midst of the Favours with which we are encompassed in this World, God layeth such a Burthen of Affliction upon us, as might serve to keep us steady, when the Wind of Temptation filleth the Sails. The Scales of Providence are even, and God weigheth out Good and Evil in due Proportion; puts that into one Condition, which may reduce it to some Ballance with another. He so allayeth the Sweet∣ness of Prosperity, and the Bitterness of Adversity, that we might preserve an equal Temper of Mind in both, and not be puffed up with one, nor cast down by the other.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012054_0009_0F896FD1F4E92698"/>
THE Dispensations of Providence being for wise and good Reasons mixed of Mercies and Judgments, our thankful Praises should be accompained with our fer∣vant Prayers. When we <HI>sing for Gladness,</HI> and shout for Joy, publishing God's Mercies and praising him for them, we should say, <HI>O Lord, we beseech thee, save thy People.</HI> Our devotional Addresses to God should be conformable to his Dispensations towards us. We have this Direction given us for them in Scripture, Phil 4.6. <HI>In every Thing by Prayer and Supplication, with Thanksgiving, let your Requests be made known unto God.</HI>—In every Thing that occurs, in every Condition, and on every proper Occasion, let Prayer be mingled with Thanksgiving,—offer your Petitions with your Thanks to Almighty God. So in 1. Thes. 5.16. <HI>Rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing. In every thing give Thanks: For this is the Will of God con∣cerning you in Christ Jesus.</HI> It is his Will declared in the Gospel, that Christians should be always rejoicing, praying, and giving of Thanks, whatever their Cir∣cumstances may be—never to cease praying, nor in any thing to omit Thanksgiving. These Duties may be well performed together without Interference, or justling one another: There is always room and occa∣sion for both.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE is always Room and Occasion for Praise and Thanksgiving, even in Circumstances of greatest Affliction and Distress. We are never incompassed with such Troubles and Sorrows in this Life, as not to have greater Cause of Thankfulness, than Complaint. We should consider what Proportion there is between the Mercies and Judgments dispensed to us in the Administrations of Providence, and not be discompos∣ed, and put out of tune by the latter for singing with
<PB N="12" REF="012054_0010_0F896FD2757E1B68"/>Gladness, and praising God for the former. We are too apt to pore only on the Afflictions we suffer, and to overlook the Blessings we enjoy. It is our Weakness, and Sin, that a small Inconvenience attending us, hindereth us from rejoicing in, and praising God for many and great Comforts. <HI>One dead Fly causeth all our Ointment to stink.</HI> One disagreeable Circumstance of our worldly State, marreth the grateful Relish of the whole. So long as there was one Man at Court, who would not cringe to him, all <HI>Haman</HI>'s Honors, Riches, royal Feasts, and the like Accommodations, <HI>availed Him nothing.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 5.13.</NOTE> The Possession of a Kingdom would not keep <HI>Ahab</HI> from being <HI>heavy and displeased,</HI> when he could not get a small Vineyard he coveted.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1. King's 21.4.</NOTE> The imaginary want of that pinched him in all his Affluence of Wealth, and took away his Stomach, so that he might have starved in the midst of his royal Dainties. Had we a due Consideration of the innumerable and inestimable Benefits God hath done unto us, we should in any Afflictions we suffer be disposed to say as <HI>Job</HI> did in his, <HI>shall we receive Good at the Hand of the Lord? and shall we not receive Evil also?</HI> Do we not receive more good than evil Things in this Life? The least of the former is more; the greatest of the latter is less than we deserve. Are our Afflictions worthy to be compared with our Mercies? <HI>Wherefore doth a liv∣ing Man complain, a Man for the Punishment of his Sins?</HI> A Man still among the living, and conscious that his Lot might justly be among the dead, should praise the God of his Life. He enjoys the most desi∣rable thing in this World, and for the sake of which, had he every other, he would part therewith. He should therefore resolve as <HI>David, While I live, will I praise the Lord: I will sing Praises unto my God while I have any being.</HI> Whatever our Losses, Crosses,
<PB N="13" REF="012054_0011_0F896FD3382DA338"/>and Afflictions be, we are, in Comparison of what is due to us, very favourably dealt with. Should a Cre∣ditor exact but a small part of our Debt to him, should we not be much pleased, and ready to thank him? And why should we not be so with respect to God, dealing thus graciously with us? He might justly deprive us of all good Things: Strip us of all our Comforts, and separate us to all evil, and only evil: It is plainly therefore our Duty to be thankful in any Condition on this side the Grave and Hell. We must acknowledge with the afflicted Church, <HI>It is of the Lord's Mercies that we are not consumed,—they are new every Morning: Great is thy faithfulness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lam. 3.22, 23.</NOTE> Even in Judgment inflicted on us, who might have it with∣out Mercy, there may be more Mercy in it than Judgment: In which Sense that is true which the Apostle saith, <HI>Mercy rejoiceth against Judgment,</HI>—<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jam. 2.13.</NOTE> boasts itself—triumphs over it. God, as the Sun (saith one) when he seemeth most to infest and scorch us, doth even then dispense useful and salutary Influences upon us. There is not indeed any thing in Nature so venemous, but that from it by Art and Industry may be extracted some what medicinal and of salutary use, when duly applied. In most apparent Evils lieth in∣closed much Good, which if we carefully separate, we may find Benefit and taste Comfort from. There is no∣thing so thoroughly bad, as being well ordered and improved, will not yield us more good. <HI>It is good for me,</HI> saith <HI>David, that I have been afflicted.</HI> There is nothing commonly more necessary, more whole∣some, and beneficial to Men than Adversity. Afflic∣tion is the School of Wisdom, in which we learn God's Statutes. It is the Furnace of the Soul, in which it is tried and refined. It is the Means of reclaiming them from Sin, and improving them in Grace, and pre∣paring
<PB N="14" REF="012054_0012_0F896FD3F680B2A0"/>them unto Glory. Why then should they be dumb to God's Praises in it, bear it with sullen Silence, or break forth into Words of Impatience under it? They have reason to sing of the Wisdom, the Good∣ness, and Faithfulness of God, in his chastising them: Not only to be contented with, but thankful for the Troubles, Disasters, and Disappointments they meet with in an evil World, as they prove on many Accounts advantageous to them. We should return Thanks to God, not for our Food only, but also for our Physic, which, tho' distasteful to our Palate, is profitable to our Health. Whatever proceeds from good Intention, and tendeth to a happy End,—is designed, and effec∣tually conduceth to our good, is a fit Subject of Thanksgiving. If we consult Experience, we shall find, that, as many have cause to mourn that they have enjoyed so much Prosperity, and received their Conso∣lation here; so many have cause to rejoice that they have suffered Adversity, and tasted so deep of the bitter Cup.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Periissem, risi Periissem.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. THERE is likewise Room and Occasion for Prayer and Supplication even in Circumstances of greatest Prosperity and Peace. In such the Lord's People should <HI>beseech</HI> him to <HI>save</HI> them—to deliver them from the Evil still incumbent, or to which they are exposed—to lengthen out their Tranquility—to complete and perfect their Salvation. With their thankful Acknowledgments of Mercies received, they are to make their humble Addresses to the Throne of Grace for all which they farther need. If we sincerely praise God for any Tokens of his Favour which he sheweth us, we shall be so affected with the Tokens of his Anger which there still may be, as earnestly to desire the removal of them. And if we are truly thankful for his Blessings, we cannot but be desirous
<PB N="15" REF="012054_0013_0F896FD4B7373D18"/>of their Continuance and Increase. We may seem highly gratified with some Instances of God's Bounty to us, greatly pleased with the Smiles of his Providence in some Respects, and yet our rejoicing in them, and praising God for them may arise from carnal Self-love; or because Provision, we may vainly imagine, is made for our Lusts, and we are Heaven's Favourites, who are so bountifully dealt with; if we, at the same Time, take no Notice of the Marks of God's Displeasure upon us in other Respects, causing us to rejoice with trembling, and in our praising God to pray unto him for his Salvation.</P>
<P>THE Memory of past Benefits, and Sense of pre∣sent, which there is in Thanksgiving, confirms our Faith, and nourishes our Hope of future. The Mercies of God are to be thankfully received and entertain'd by us, as Pledges of his Love, and so Encouragements to trust in him, and seek unto him for all we farther need. And a truly grateful Sense of Benefits done unto us, is the best Preparation of the Heart to ask for more. It is the Disposition to which our divine Benefactor hath special Regard, in the Bestowment of them. He is ready to give, wherever he seeth a Disposition worthily to entertain his Blessings: So that the most thankful Receiver of them, is the most successful Petitioner for them. When therefore we are most sensible of our great Benefactor's Goodness in those Effects of it which we with Hearts glowing with Gratitude acknowledge; our ardent Petitions breathed out to him with our thankful Praises will (we may hope) be accepted and granted by him. Fervent Prayer, mingled with Thanksgiving, availeth much. If we thus make known our Requests to God, he will be so far from stinting his Hand to us, that he
<PB N="16" REF="012054_0014_0F896FD575962B90"/>will <HI>rejoice over us to do us good,</HI> and be as ready and as highly pleased to multiply his Benefits upon us, as we can be to ask and receive them.</P>
<P>IN every thing that we give Thanks, there is need of Prayer also, that it may be to us Matter of Thanks∣giving:—that it may prove advantageous unto us, that our Blessings may not be cursed, nor our Afflicti∣ons be unsanctified to us; but that all Things of different Qualities mixed and dispensed by the skilful Hand of Providence, may, either in their present and imme∣diate, or in their future and more remote Consequen∣ces, <HI>work together for our good.</HI></P>
<P>THERE being always Room and Occasion in all Con∣ditions and Circumstances for Thanksgiving and Prayer, these are Duties which should always accompany one another.</P>
<P>MY BRETHREN,</P>
<P>WE see the Expedience and Propriety of appoin∣ting this Day to be observed as a Day of <HI>public Thanks∣giving</HI> throughout this Province: and that the Purpo∣poses of a <HI>public Fast,</HI> (which some may think would have been more seasonable) may be answered thereby, if the People, as they are exhorted, <Q>accompany their devout Praises for the many great and undeserved public Mercies, which amidst the various Tokens of his Displeasure, God hath bestowed on us, with their fervent Prayers to him, that those Judgments which we labour under may be removed—that those we have reason to fear may be averted—and that we may be prepared suitably to receive every Token of Divine Favour which it may please a mer∣ciful God to bestow upon us.</Q> The religious Ser∣vice
<PB N="17" REF="012054_0015_0F896FD63724F180"/>of the Day being in the Magistrates Order for it so clearly pointed out to us, the Minister should direct and urge the sincere Performance of it.—Suffer we therefore this Word of Exhortation, <HI>sing for gladness,—publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy People.</HI> Let us offer our united Praises for the Favours con∣ferred upon us in the Course of the Year past, which hath not indeed been withouts it's Troubles, and such as have been complained of as the greatest ever met with in the Country. We have yet Cause to celebrate our annual <HI>solemn Feast,</HI> and rejoice before the Lord. An Expression in the Prophets occurs to my Thoughts; <HI>Offer a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving with Leaven.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Am. 4.5.</NOTE> Leaven was forbidden in other Sacrifices,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lev. 2.11.</NOTE> but requi∣red in this of Thanksgiving,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">C. 7. V. 13.</NOTE> to teach us (saith <HI>Ains∣worth</HI>) to temper our Joy with Sorrow and Affliction in this Life. Our Joy on this Day of the Gladness of our Hearts, should be tempered, but not stifled, with a sorrowful Sense of the Affliction which the Province is in. Notwithstanding which, there are many and great public Mercies, which call for our thankful Acknowledgments. Particularly, the Peace which we have in the Peace of our Nation with foreign Ene∣mies, by His Majesty's Care preserved to all his Do∣minions. It is for a Lamentation, that we have been no more at peace among ourselves. Pray we for the Peace of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI>—The general Health we have been and still are favoured with, demands our public Thanks; and we shall heartily render the same to God, unless the Commonness and Continuance of so great a Blessing hath abated and enervated our Gratitude. We have not been visited this Year with infectious, or any epedemical Diseases, which have sometimes carried People away as with a Flood: Though some (alass!) have been <HI>driven from Light
<PB N="18" REF="012054_0016_0F896FD6F9DFCFA8"/>into Darkness, and chased out of the World,</HI> by the Violence of stormy Winds, and of human Hands. While our Souls bless the Lord, who healeth our Di∣seases, and redeemeth our Lives from Destruction, who stilleth the Noise of the Seas, the Noise of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People; let us pray, that the People may be forgiven all their Iniquity, and so the Inhabitants of this Land may not say, <HI>we are sick:</HI> nor have Occasion, or Colour, of Complaint, that their <HI>Blood is shed like Water</HI>—poured forth with∣out Pity or Remorse—too often the sad Consequence of intestine Jars and Quarrels. Let us beseech the Lord, who ruleth the raging of the Sea, to restrain the Wrath of Men, which is cruel when it breaketh out in mobbish Fury, or military Resentment.</P>
<P>THERE is the Joy of a plentiful Harvest, in which we are to sing with Gladness, and shout forth the Praises of Him that hath given us fruitful Seasons, and crowned the Year with his Goodness so that we have all Things necessary and convenient for Life and Godliness still given us richly to enjoy, tho' so much of the worldly Substance of many, especially in this and other maritime Towns, hath been destroyed by the raging Tempest, and swelling Tide. By whatever Means our Estates have been dimished, or our thriv∣ing in them obstructed,—whether by impoverishing Events of divine Providence, or oppressive Measures of human Government, or our own Imprudence, yet the good Encrease of our Land (free from Parliamentary Taxation) certainly calls for the Observation of this an∣niversary Solemnity. In which, while we with Hearts full of Food and Gladness give Thanks to the Author of our Plenty, let us take heed, and pray, that our Table may not become a Snare before us, and what is de∣signed
<PB N="19" REF="012054_0017_0F896FD7B4E16250"/>for our Welfare be a Trap—that we may not abuse the good Things our great Benefactor with so li∣beral a Hand bestowed on us, to Intemperance and Sensuality, Irreligion and Forgetfulness of God. Let not <HI>the Feast of In-gathering</HI> be made by any of us the Season, nor prove to any the Occasion of riotous Excess, and sinful Extravagance. May the Lord save his Peo∣ple in this Land from such Gluttony and Drunkenness, and voluptuous Living, as he charged his People Israel with in their affluent Circumstances, and, which was an Aggravation of their Sins, they most indulg'd themselves in on the solemn Feast-days appointed and set apart on purpose religiously to commemorate the Blessings and Benefits they had received from God, and to return him due Thanks therefor. "Wo unto them that rise up early in the Morning, that they may fol∣low strong Drink, that continue until Night, till Wine inflame them. And the Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe, and Wine are in their Feasts, but they regard not the Works of the Lord, nor consider the Operation of his Hands,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 5.11, 12.</NOTE>—i. e. the Works of God in Memory of which those Feasts were kept. Their only Care and Thought was to feed and pamper their Lusts with the Produce of a fruitful Land, and not to bless God who gave it them for an Inheritance, and therefore he cut them short as he threaten'd, —<HI>Yea, ten Acres of Vineyard shall yield one Bath, and the Seed of an Omer shall yield an Ephah,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. 10.</NOTE>—the Harvest should produce but the tenth part of the Seed.</P>
<P>OF the enumerated public Mercies which we are called upon this Day thankfully to acknowledge, there is none, perhaps, to which People find their Hearts so indisposed, as that of the Administration of civil Go∣vernment; which hath been loudly complained of in
<PB N="20" REF="012054_0018_0F896FD93A9C68E8"/>our Mother-Country, and in this. And it might only increase the Clamours of some at it, to exhort them to sing with Gladness for it, and to bless God with those Tongues that have been used to curse Men, made after his Image. I don't suspect there are any such among my Hearers; and may therefore safely put them in Mind of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Exhortation to Christians, under greater Oppression from bad Rulers, than we suffer at this Day; that <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> as well as <HI>Prayers, be made for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.1, 2</NOTE> Magistrates are the Ministers of God to us for good, and when they faithfully discharge their Office, and answer the End of their Institution, they are to be reckon'd among the greatest Blessings of God to the World. With all their superior Abilities and Advantages to promote the common Wealth, they have the natural Infirmities of other Men, and far beyond other Men are subject to Temptations, which too often mislead them into pernicious Courses of Administration, and they do the People much hurt. And when the <HI>Wicked bear Rule, the People mourn.</HI>—And if it should admit of a doubt, whether Mankind receive Good from civil Government, sufficient to make amends for the Evil they suffer, through the Mistakes, Follies, and Tyrannies of those who manage it; yet they must be worse Rulers than are known in <HI>Old England,</HI> or <HI>New,</HI> from whose Administration People do not receive more Benefits, than they suffer Mischiefs: And they should accept the former with Thankfulness to God, while they groan under, and in lawful Ways seek Deliverance from the latter. What the Proportion between these hath been in the late difficult Times, among us, I'm not about to com∣pute: Would only observe to you, that the religious Privileges, for the Sake of which principally, our pious
<PB N="21" REF="012054_0019_0F896F0216A19FF8"/>Ancestors came into this Land, are hitherto enjoyed by us: and 'tis not pretended to be more than the Beginning of Encroachment on our civil Rights, that hath so justly alarmed our Fears of losing them all. By the Blessing of God on the Government over us, we continue as yet possessed of the most valuable Liberties and Privileges belonging to Englishmen, and Christians, and do lead our Lives so comfortably as we do. We have still Rulers that will not oppress us themselves, nor, if they can prevent it, suffer others to oppress us.—Those exercising Authority over us, whom we may justly call Benefactors; and for whom we owe our Thanks to him whose Ministers they are to us for Good.</P>
<P>IF the late Disturbance of the public Peace, is to be imputed wholly to oppressive Acts of Government, (which are apt to make a <HI>wise</HI> People <HI>mad,</HI>) yet this with all it's bad Consequences is to be regarded as a sore Judgment of God upon us; and the Joy of this Day be mixed with Sorrow on account of it. By leaving us to fall into ruinous Contention among our∣selves—into a most unquiet State, in which Men's Minds have been extremely discomposed, and exas∣perated; their Mouths filled with evil Speeches, bitter Invectives, and horrid Execrations; and their Hands stretched out in base injurious Deeds of Violence—the public Counsels have been divided—friendly and pro∣fitable Commerce interrupted,—Tumults raised—Out∣rages commited—Blood shed, a righteous God hath punished us for our Iniquities. His holy Anger hath been testified against us in all our Troubles, whoever were the most active, faulty Instruments of them. Let us therefore, in the exercise of godly Sorrow, which is consistent with spiritual Rejoicing, beseech the
<PB N="22" REF="012054_0020_0F896FDA4366D980"/>Lord to save his People out of so sinful and calami∣tous a State. Let us hope continually in God, pray to him without ceasing, and praise him more and more. If we are truly thankful for any Tokens of the divine Favour towards us in the Administrations of Govern∣ment, our fervent Prayers accompanying our devout Praises to the great Governor of the World, who hath the Hearts of all Kings and Rulers in his Hand, may avail to procure his Blessing on the public Counsels, so as that they shall be directed to such Measures as shall promote our lasting Welfare and Tranquility. We must not expect the Perfection of Happiness under the best human Management of our public Affairs, and that all things will proceed according to our Minds. Nor must we faint, and be discouraged, tho' our Grie∣vances be not all at once redressed. For the Exercise of our Faith and Patience Things may remain still in doubtful uncertainty, and we not be able to say whe∣ther they tend to Ruin, or Establishment. The late Time of Trouble and Distress in the Land, hath been spoken of as the darkest Day that ever passed over us. Be it so, yet who knows but that the present is the <HI>Evening Time</HI> of such a Day, when God hath said <HI>it shall be light?</HI> Let us rejoice in Hope, and pray in Faith, that we, and our Children to the latest Poste∣rity, may enjoy such Peace, Freedom, and Felicity in the Land which our Fathers have left us for an Inhe∣ritance, as God promised to give his oppressed People, the Remnant of <HI>Israel,</HI> in their Restoration to their former happy State, for which they were to <HI>sing with Gladness, and shout among the Nations, to publish, praise, and pray,</HI> as in the Text. Jer. 30.18.—<HI>Thus saith the Lord, I will bring again the Captivity of Jacob's Tents, and have Mercy on his Dwelling Places, and the City shall be built on her own Heap, and the
<PB N="23" REF="012054_0021_0F896FDAB561D908"/>Palace shall remain after the Manner thereof. And out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving, and the Voice of them that make merry: And I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. Their Children also shall be as aforetime, and their Congregation shall be established be∣fore me, and I will punish all that oppress them. And their Nobles shall be of themselves, and their</HI> GOVERNOR <HI>shall proceed from the midst of them.</HI></P>
