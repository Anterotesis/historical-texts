<Q><BIBL>MALACHI 1.14</BIBL>
<P><HI>For I am a</HI> GREAT KING, <HI>saith the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Words are <HI>few,</HI> but very <HI>awful,</HI> and aw∣fully to be regarded. Let us consider with great Reverence and Attention, <HI>Who</HI> it is that here speaks, <HI>who</HI> is spoken of, <HI>what</HI> is said, to <HI>whom</HI> and on what <HI>Occasion.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is the LORD GOD OF HOSTS speak∣ing of <HI>Himself.</HI> Let the Earth be moved, and all that dwell on it be silent and attentive.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stile</HI> of the true and living GOD, the Lord JEHOVAH, the GOD of <HI>Israel,</HI> is this — <HI>"His Name is the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS. The true GOD must be so; and HE that is the LORD <HI>of all Hosts</HI> must be the true GOD. For the <HI>Stile</HI> speaks and affirms supream, universal and absolute <HI>Dominion</HI> over all Worlds, and over all Things in Heaven and Earth. Isal. xxxvii. 16. <HI>O</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of Hosts,</HI> GOD <HI>of Israel, Thou art the</HI> GOD, <HI>even thou alone.</HI> It is the appropriate and incommunicable Name of the eternal, infinite, almighty and incomprehensible GODHEAD: And after the Name JEHOVAH there is none by which GOD has pleas'd to make Himself known, that is more Magnificent than this, THE LORD OF HOSTS. 1 Chron. xvii. 24. <HI>That thy Name may be magnified for ever, saying, The</HI> LORD OF HOSTS <HI>is the</HI> GOD <HI>of Israel even a</HI> GOD <HI>to Israel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003645_0004_10023BAA4A5BF658"/>
This mighty LORD, the <HI>blessed and only Potentate,</HI> here speaks of <HI>Himself:</HI> Himself the <HI>Speaker</HI> and Himself the <HI>Subject.</HI> He cannot speak of a <HI>Greater,</HI> and He only is fit to speak of <HI>Him∣self,</HI> who only comprehends Himself. <HI>For the things of God know∣eth no Man</HI> (nor Angel) <HI>out the</HI> SPIRIT OF GOD: As He pleases to reveal concerning Himself unto his Creatures. Job xxxvii. 19. <HI>Teach us what we shall say, for we cannot order our Speech by reason of Darkness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Words <HI>worthy of Himself,</HI> truly <HI>great</HI> and <HI>glorious,</HI> are here spoken: <HI>I am a</HI> GREAT KING <HI>saith the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS.</P>
<P>He is a KING: that is the <HI>least</HI> that can be said of Him, tho' <HI>Kings</HI> are the greatest and highest Things we have on Earth: And because we have none <HI>greater</HI> here below, there∣fore are <HI>Kings</HI> the shadows to us of the DIVINE MAJESTY.</P>
<P>But the LORD is a GREAT KING. How <HI>Great</HI> can't be said. The <HI>Potentates</HI> of this World are <HI>little</HI> parcels of Dust, and Worms before HIM. It is a <HI>small</HI> thing to say of the <HI>great</HI> GOD, <HI>He is higher than the Kings of the Earth.</HI> He is the great King of <HI>Heaven,</HI> the <HI>King of Glory.</HI> His <HI>Hests</HI> speak best how great his <HI>Dominion</HI> is: Psalm. xxiv. 10. <HI>The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.</HI> Jerem. xlvii. 18. <HI>As I live, saith the</HI> KING, <HI>whose Name is the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To whom,</HI> and upon what <HI>Occasion,</HI> spake the Great GOD these Words of Himself? It was to his <HI>worshiping People,</HI> and to his <HI>Pricsts,</HI> the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Religion among them. It was to <HI>strike</HI> them with an awful Apprehension of his own Majesty and Greatness. It was to <HI>reprove</HI> them for and <HI>convince</HI> them of, their profane and contemptuous Carriage toward Him, in their pretended Worship. It was to <HI>arraign,</HI> terrify and humble a wicked, hypocritical, formal, professing People; to admonish them of his Power, Justice and Wrath, and that he was coming near unto them in Judgment. <HI>Cursed be the Deceiver that hath in his Flock a Male, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oweth and sacrificeth to the LORD, a corrupt thing: For I am a</HI> GREAT KING, <HI>saith the</HI> LORD OF HOSTS, <HI>and my Name is dreadful.</HI> Psalm. xlvii. 2. <HI>For the</HI> LORD, <HI>most High, is nerrible; He is a great King over all the Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. GOD <HI>is a</HI> KING. He <HI>condescends</HI> to take this <HI>Stile</HI> to Him∣self. It is <HI>necessary</HI> and essential to Him to be <HI>King</HI> of the World: King <HI>over</HI> all his Works and <HI>unto</HI> all, for his <HI>own Glory</HI> and <HI>their Good</HI> His is <HI>the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory,</HI> by a natural unalienable Right, Propriety and absolute Authority. The CREATOR of all things must have the Sove∣reign and inconcestible Dominion over all, and the Great
<PB N="3" REF="003645_0005_10023BABDA2CF550"/>PRESERVER of all things must exercise Government and Rule over all.</P>
<P N="1">1. As a King GOD gives <HI>Laws</HI> to his Creatures. Isai. xxxiii. 22. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is our Lawgiver, the</HI> LORD <HI>is our King.</HI> He has written his Law <HI>in</HI> Man, and he has publish'd it <HI>to</HI> him. He has pass'd it with <HI>Royal</HI> Majesty, <HI>"I am the</HI> LORD. He came down from Heaven in great Glory, and proclaim'd it with Sound of <HI>Trumpet,</HI> and a Discharge of the <HI>Artillery</HI> of Heaven. He gives Laws to <HI>Angels</HI> that are higher than we, and they do his Will, hearkning to the Voice of his Word. He has given his Law to the mighty Frame of the <HI>Universe,</HI> even to all the vast <HI>Globes</HI> in all their various <HI>Circles;</HI> and they con∣tinue this day in their excellent Order and wonderful Motion, according to his Ordinance, for all are his Servants. In our lower Regions, <HI>Fire, Hail and Snow, Vapour and stormy Wind fulfil his Word.</HI> This is a <HI>Kingly Part</HI> to give Laws and Or∣ders unto all, and to be obeyed.</P>
<P N="2">2. As <HI>more</HI> than a King, He <HI>sustains and upholds</HI> all things in Being. He is the <HI>Breath of our Nostrils:</HI> Our <HI>Life</HI> and the length of our Days. In Him we live and move and have our Being. He preserveth Man and Beast. In his Hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the breath of all Mankind. How much more is this than the Protection, Defence or Main∣tenance, that Princes and Governments on Earth can afford their Subjects. Should God remove his sustaining Hand, all Flesh would perish together, and all Worlds would fall into Ruine and Confusion. The <HI>Orbs</HI> of the Universe would <HI>dosh</HI> one against another, and run into their original <HI>Chaos,</HI> and Darkness would cover the Desolation for ever and ever▪ GOD <HI>hears up</HI> the Pillars of the Earth, or it and its Inhabitants would <HI>dissolve</HI> together, Psalm. lxxv. 3.</P>
<P N="3">3. More than Princely or Kingly is <HI>his Royal Bounty</HI> and Munificence. He keeps the Table and Feast of a King. He feeds all his Creatures. <HI>He giveth Food to all Flesh.</HI> All Eyes wait on Him, and he giveth them their Meat in due Season. He fills 'em with Good, he satisfies the Desire of every liv∣ing thing. The Earth is full of his Riches. <HI>All things come of Him,</HI> and it is <HI>of his own</HI> that we make our Returns to Him. This is more than <HI>Royal:</HI> it is a Glory truly <HI>Divine:</HI> 1 Chron. xxix. 11. <HI>Thine O Lord is the Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majesty! for all that is in the Heaven and on the Earth is thine; thine is the Kingdom, O</HI> LORD, <HI>and Thou art exalted Head above all.</HI> Earthly <HI>Kings</HI> are supported in their Magnificence by their Subjects, but the <HI>Divine</HI> MAJESTY supplies all his Dominions with all they have,
<PB N="4" REF="003645_0006_10023BAD6AD754B8"/>and gives them all things richly to enjoy. ver. 16. O LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>all this store cometh of thy Hand, and it is all thine own.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 As a King GOD <HI>judges, rewards and punishes.</HI> He doeth Judgment and Justice. These are the <HI>Habitation of his Throne.</HI> He reigns and rules in Righteousness. He is the <HI>just</HI> LORD in the midst of us. He governs by Law; just and right is He. He <HI>loveth Righteousness, and executeth Judgment in the Earth:</HI> He <HI>is excellent in Judgment, and in plenty of Justice: Holy in all his Ways and Works.</HI> There is no Iniquity with the LORD our GOD, nor Respect of Persons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As a King he <HI>rewards the Good.</HI> His Countenance be∣holds the Upright. Verily there is a Reward for the Righ∣teous. These He delights to honour; He dignifies and enobles them. He rewards like a King with a munificent Hand. Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it enter'd in∣to the Heart of Man to conceive the things which GOD has prepared for them that love him. The LORD will render to every Man his Righteousness and Faithfulness; He will re∣compence his Work, and a full Reward shall be given him. He blesses indeed, with all spiritual Blessings, in hea∣venly Places. The LORD will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. He has Crowns and Kingdoms to give; the <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> a <HI>Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As a King He <HI>punishes the Wicked,</HI> the Enemies of his Crown and Dignity. He will not hold them guiltless. He will render Vengeance to his Enemies, and destroy them that hate Him. He is able to save and to destroy. The wicked shall not go unpunished. His Power and his Wrath are a∣gainst them that forsake Him. He seeth Wickedness, and will not acquit. He has appointed a Day, in which he will Judge the World in Righteousness. Then his Enemies, who would not have him to reign over them, shall be brought forth and slain before Him. They shall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget GOD. Thus <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>is our</HI> KING, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>is our</HI> JUDGE. He judges Men now, he will judge them in the last and great Day. His Reward is with Him.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="5">5. As a King he leads his <HI>Armies</HI> to War, and <HI>fights</HI> his Battles. He has Enemies in War against Him; and his King∣dom, People and Cause to defend. He is <HI>the</HI> GOD <HI>of Armies, the</HI> LORD <HI>strong and mighty, the</HI> LORD <HI>mighty in Battle. He comes down to fight for Mount Zion, and for the Hill thereof.</HI> He musters the Hosts of <HI>Angels,</HI> and covers the Mountains
<PB N="5" REF="003645_0007_10023BAF00703A78"/>with invisible Chariots and Horses of Fire. He commands the Stars in their Courses to fight against <HI>Sisera,</HI> and the Clouds to fire and thunder upon the <HI>Philistines.</HI> Again, He (the most Mighty) girds his Sword upon his Thigh, with his Glory and his Majesty; and in his Majesty rides pros∣perously because of Truth and Meekness and Righteousness; and his right Hand doth terrible Things; His Arrows are sharp in the hearts of his Enemies, and the People fall under Him. He takes hold of Shield and Buckler, and stands up for the Help of his People; He draws out the Spear and stops the Way against their Persecutors. He presides over the great Events of War and Battles, and there is no King saved by the Multitude of an Host, a mighty Man is not deliver'd by his much Strength. He giveth Salvation unto Kings, and delivereth his Servants from the hurtful Sword.</P>
<P N="6">6. As a King He has <HI>Princes</HI> under Him, and sends his <HI>Envoys and Ambassadors</HI> on Treaties of Peace, or to denounce War and Death; Or to promise Succour to the Distressed, and Salvation to them that are ready to perish.</P>
<P>He has his mighty <HI>Angels</HI> that stand in his Presence, and go on his Messages, and arm at his Word. They are his Glory and Court above; and are they not ministring Spirits sent forth to the World below? Whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, they are alike his Ministers of Mercy or of Judgment, according to the Or∣ders they receive from Him. <HI>Gabriel</HI> flies down to <HI>David</HI> on the Wings of Love, and Another draws on the <HI>Assyrian Host</HI> and slays an Army in a Night.</P>
<P><HI>Kings</HI> on Earth are his Substitutes here below, their Hearts are in his Hand, and he turns 'em like the Rivers of Water, which wind thro' the Earth and enrich and adorn it. They propose and project, but GOD disposes, to Events contrary to their Intentions. He makes them his Rod and Sword, which He breaks or burns as soon as he has us'd <HI>The Pillars of the Earth are his, and he hath set the World upon them.</HI></P>
<P>He has a <HI>peculiar Order of Men,</HI> whom He Calls and sepa∣rates unto and for Himself, to be his <HI>Ministers</HI> and Messen∣gers to a wicked World. Such were his <HI>Prophets</HI> in the Days of the Old Testament, and the <HI>Apostles</HI> of our LORD JESUS CHRIST afterward: Such were the <HI>Levites</HI> under the Law to <HI>Israel,</HI> and such are <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> the Gifts of the As∣cended SAVIOUR to his Church unto the End of the World His Commission to them is that, Matt. xxviii. 19. <HI>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the</HI> FATHER, <HI>and of
<PB N="6" REF="003645_0008_10023B5F8B6C1280"/>the</HI> SON, <HI>and of the</HI> HOLY GHOST; <HI>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have Commanded you,</HI> &amp;c. And the Diguity here∣in put on them is that, 2 Corinth. v. 20. <HI>New then we are Ambassadors from</HI> CHRIST, <HI>as tho'</HI> GOD <HI>did beseech you by us, we pray you in</HI> CHRIST's <HI>stead, Be ye reconciled to</HI> GOD. These <HI>Men of</HI> GOD come to us in the Name of the Great King of Heaven, clothed with his Authority, with his Word in their Mouth, and they say to <HI>Zion, Thy</HI> GOD <HI>reigneth!, thy</HI> KING <HI>cometh, bringing Salvation.</HI> They bring the Alarm of <HI>War,</HI> and Denunciation of Wrath against the wicked and ungodly: And they bring Messages of <HI>Peace,</HI> a Proclamation of Pardon and Grace unto penitent believing Sinners. They come upon the most honourable and momentous Concern that can be, the Salvation of lost Souls; and <HI>how beautiful should their Feet be</HI> unto all to whom they are sent?</P>
<P N="7">7. And lastly, As a King <HI>He receives Petitions, and claims Tri∣bute, Worship and Obedience.</HI> He sits upon a Throne of Grace, with his golden Scepter in his hand, and to them that ap∣proach him with a loyal Heart he holds it forth; for them to kneel down and kiss it. He is the <HI>rightful King</HI> that has justly forbidden Men to make Petition unto any <HI>God</HI> beside Him. He receives our Prayers by the Hand of his own SON, in whose Name he has bid us ask of Him. He says to the humble Petitioner, <HI>What is thy Request and it shall be given thee, even to a Kingdom?</HI> We have a Right thro' Grace, a Liberty of Access thro' CHRIST, to go and <HI>cry to the King:</HI> Psal. xx. 9. <HI>Save</HI> LORD! <HI>let the King hear us when we call.</HI></P>
<P>He claims a Tribute of Duty, Honour and Service from us. Such as we have to give, which also we receive from Him, he accepts at our Hands. We are His, and all that we have. He requires us to present our Selves, Soul and Body, a living Sacrifice, which is our reasonable Service. We must love Him with all our Hearts, laud Him with our Lips, and glorify Him in our Lives. We must govern our Tho't, Words and Actions by his holy Law. We must regard his Will, act for his Glory, study his Pleasure, prize his Favour, consult his Honour and Interest, fear to offend Him, and humble our selves in deep Repentance, with Sorrow Fear and Shame, for every Sin whereby we have dishonoured and offended Him. We must believe in HIM whom GOD hath sent, looking for the Mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST unto Eternal Life. In all this we must shew ourselves his faithful <HI>Subjects.</HI> Deut. x. 12, 13, 14. <HI>And now Israel, what doth the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>require of thee? but to fear the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD, <HI>to walk in all his Ways, and to love Him, and to serve the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul; to keep the Command∣ments
<PB N="7" REF="003645_0009_10023BB22F166D98"/>of the</HI> LORD, <HI>and his Statutes which I command thee this day for thy Good:</HI> ver. 20. <HI>Thou shalt therefore fear the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD <HI>Him shalt thou serve and to Him shalt thou cleave, and shalt swear by his Name, for He is thy Praise.</HI> This <HI>Oath of Allegiance</HI> we have taken to the KING of Heaven, and this is the <HI>Tribute</HI> of Praise and Obedience that He has laid on us, and these are the <HI>Vows</HI> which we must be daily perform∣ing to Him, in Acknowledgment of his <HI>Majesty and Dominion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. GOD <HI>is a</HI> GREAT KING. I am a <HI>Great King.</HI> saith the LORD OF HOSTS. GREATNESS is one of the High Attributes of GOD. Jerem. xxxii. 18. <HI>The Great, the Mighty</HI> GOD, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>of Hosts is his Name.</HI> Deut. x. 17. <HI>For the</HI> LORD <HI>your</HI> GOD <HI>is a</HI> GREAT GOD, <HI>a mighty and terrible.</HI> Isai. xii. 6. GREAT <HI>is the Holy One of Israel.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All that is in</HI> GOD <HI>is Great.</HI> He is <HI>Infinite, Immense</HI> in all Excellency and Perfection. <HI>Great is our</HI> LORD, <HI>and of great Power.</HI> Psalm. cxlvii. 5. <HI>He is</HI> GREAT <HI>in Counsel and ex∣cellent in Working.</HI> Jerem. xxxii. 19. <HI>Great is his Faithfulness.</HI> Lamen. iii. 23. <HI>Very great are his Mercies</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Chron. xxi. 13. And <HI>great is his Wrath.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 King. xxii. 13.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Works</HI> of the Lord are <HI>Great,</HI> and do declare his Greatness. He has made this <HI>great World</HI> which we behold: <HI>Made the Earth by his Power, and stretched forth the Heavens by his Wisdom.</HI> And his <HI>Providence</HI> which upholds and governs all declares Him to be very Great: Psalm. cxxxv. 5.6. <HI>For I know that the</HI> LORD <HI>is great, and that our</HI> GOD <HI>is above all Gods; Whatsoever the</HI> LORD <HI>pleaseth that doth He in Heaven, on Earth, in the Seas and in all deep Places: He causeth the Vapours to ascend from the Ends of the Earth, He maketh Lightnings for the Rain, He bringeth the Wind out of his Treasuries.</HI> Dan. iv. 3. <HI>How Great are his Signs! and how mighty his Wonders!</HI> As the Heavens for Height, and as the Earth for Depth, so is the Greatness of this King unsearchable.</P>
<P N="1">1. He is the <HI>Great King,</HI> for He is the <HI>King eternal, and immortal.</HI> This is the Glory ascribed to Him, 1 Tim. i. 17. And a great Glory it is, and declares Him to be a great King. <HI>Kings</HI> on Earth were born but t'other day, and they die to morrow. They were <HI>Infants</HI> and Babes at the Breast but a few days ago. They have their <HI>Ancestors</HI> and Predeces∣sors that have been before them, and they glory in their <HI>Line</HI> that are long since dead, and are proud of their <HI>Suc∣cessors,</HI> descending from them; that their Family are like to reign after them. Ah poor and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Glory of mortal Princes, which shall not descend with them! Be they called <HI>Gods</HI> on
<PB N="8" REF="003645_0010_10023BB559C8B158"/>Earth, yet they shall <HI>die</HI> like other Men, and <HI>a Grace among the Kings</HI> is their last Honour.</P>
<P>How <HI>Great</HI> would an <HI>Earthly King</HI> account Himself could he purchase for Himself <HI>Immortality</HI> upon his Throne! The Princes of this World do vainly dream of and aspire after an immor∣tal <HI>Name,</HI> immortal <HI>Fame;</HI> build <HI>Pillars</HI> for Themselves while they live, and <HI>desolate Places</HI> for their dead Bodies.</P>
<P>But GOD <HI>only hath Immortality!</HI> He is <HI>King for ever and ever!</HI> He ever was so, is and will be so; He is <HI>without Beginning of Days, or End of Years!</HI> His <HI>Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and his Dominion is from Generation to Generation.</HI> So <HI>Nebuchad∣nezzar,</HI> the great King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> spake of the MOST HIGH GOD, unto all People, Nations and Languages that dwell on the Face of the whole Earth: And so said <HI>Darius</HI> of the GOD of <HI>Daniel.</HI> Dan. iv. 3. <HI>I blessed the most High, and praised and honoured Him that liveth for ever and ever.</HI> vi. 26. <HI>He is the liv∣ing</HI> GOD <HI>and stedfast for ever: His Kingdom is that which shall not be destroyed, and his Dominion shall be even unto the End.</HI></P>
<P>The dying <HI>Kings</HI> of the Earth need the <HI>Prayers</HI> of their Sub∣jects <HI>to the</HI> GOD <HI>of Heaven</HI> for their Life: And in a limited Sense it may be a pious Prayer for Them, "<HI>O King live for Ever!</HI> But it cannot be, how much soever it may sometimes be desired. They are gathered to their Fathers and see Cor∣ruption. Even the House of <HI>David</HI> was so. There is a <HI>Mone</HI> written on the <HI>Wall</HI> against every <HI>Kingdom and Empire</HI> in the World; <HI>God hath number'd thy Kingdom and finish'd it.</HI> But GOD is the <HI>Everlasting King.</HI> This is his <HI>Greatness.</HI> What greater thing can be said of HIM? "<HI>I am the first and the last! I am He that liveth! I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End! which was, and which is, and which is to come! the same yesterday, to day and forever.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God is the <HI>Great</HI> King, for He is the <HI>Supream Being, the</HI> MOST HIGH. There are that are called <HI>Gods</HI> many, and <HI>Lords</HI> many; and they are <HI>great Names</HI> among the Creatures of GOD; they may be <HI>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers,</HI> some in Heaven and some on the Earth; But all these are subject to GOD and infinitely below Him. His Title is, KING <HI>of Kings and</HI> LORD <HI>of Lords.</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 15. How great a King is HE, <HI>by Whom Kings reign and Princes decree Judgment!</HI> and Whom <HI>all Dominion and Power serves and obeys!</HI></P>
<P>When any of the Princes of this World conquer their Neigh∣bour Kings, and add to Themselves their Dominions, then they account themselves <HI>Great,</HI> having Princes under them, and Kings
<PB N="9" REF="003645_0011_10023B6174DB1CD8"/>doing them Homage. So the <HI>Assyrian</HI> when he had extended his <HI>Empire,</HI> and triumphed in many <HI>Victories</HI> over the <HI>Nations</HI> and their <HI>Gods,</HI> which were no Gods, then he assum'd the Stile of the <HI>Great King.</HI> 2 Kings xviii 19. But who gave Him his Greatness, and took it away again? the same GOD OF HEA∣VEN, who afterward gave a Kingdom, Power, Strength and Glory to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> and made Him a King of Kings: Dan. ii. 37. HE ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men, and gives 'em to whom he will, and sometimes to the basest of Men. He puts down one and sets up another. The Powers that be are ordained by Him. All the Kings of the Earth should fear His Glory, and kiss THE SON, HIS CHRIST, who is Higher than the Kings of the Earth; and there is given Him the Domi∣nion, that all People, Nations and Languages should serve Him.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD is a <HI>great</HI> King, for He is the <HI>Universal King.</HI> This necessarily results from his <HI>Supremacy. His Kingdom ruleth over all.</HI> It is extended every where. It has no Bounds. Heaven is his Throne and the Earth his Footstool. Now the <HI>Extent</HI> of Empires makes Kings great. In the Multitude of People is the Kings Honour. This was the <HI>Persian</HI> Pride and Gran∣deur: Esther i. 1. <HI>This is Ahasuerus which reigned from In∣dia even to Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty Pro∣vinces.</HI> How Great was this Man in his own Eyes, and in the eyes of the World! but GOD is infinitely greater in the Sight of Angels and Saints: 2 Kings. xix. 15. <HI>Hezekiah prayed be∣fore the</HI> LORD, <HI>and said, O</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of Israel, Thou, even Thou alone, art</HI> GOD <HI>of all the Kingdoms of the Earth.</HI> Genesis xiv. 22. <HI>I have lifted up my Hand unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>the most High</HI> GOD, <HI>the Possessor of Heaven and Earth.</HI> 1 Chron. xxix. 11. <HI>For all that is in the Heaven and on the Earth is thine! thine is the King∣dom O</HI> LORD, <HI>and Thou art exalted</HI> GOD <HI>above all.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. GOD is the <HI>Great King,</HI> for He is <HI>Independent and Absolute.</HI> Kings, on Earth depend on GOD, from whom they derive their Being and their Power. Yea they depend on <HI>Others</HI> for their Exercise of Power and Rule. <HI>The King is served of the Field.</HI> He depends on the Husbandman for his sumptuous Table.</P>
<P>Kings are also <HI>limited</HI> by GOD both as to the Extent and Exercise of their Power. They may not act as they list, or do what they will. GOD is the only <HI>absolute</HI> Lord and Sovereign. Job. xxxiv. 13. <HI>Who hath given Him a Charge over the whole Earth? who hath disposed the whole World? who hath enjoyned Him his Way? or to whom giveth He any Account of his Matters?</HI> Kings reign by <HI>Contract</HI> and Covenant with their People! but God's Right is in Himself, eternal and unalienable, and his Power is irresistible. Daniel iv 35. <HI>He doeth according to his
<PB N="10" REF="003645_0012_10023BB722D42340"/>Will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth! and none can stay his Hand, or say unto Him "What doest thou?</HI> Absolute Power is the true and real Greatness of Dominion, but can belong to ONE <HI>only,</HI> which is GOD. No Creature may pretend to it, or can be fit for it. It would be impious Insolence and Arrogance in the best and first of <HI>Angels</HI> to aspire after it. The <HI>Pride</HI> which was the Condem∣nation of the <HI>Devil</HI> was, it may be, something akin to this. It is yet less Sufferable in Dust and Ashes to say, <HI>I will be like the most</HI> HIGH. It is not for Kings to say absolutely, <HI>I will.</HI> The Reason is because they are imperfect in Knowledge and Virtue, and may err and sin.</P>
<P>What a woful World would an <HI>Absolute Sinner</HI> make? Such a one as <HI>Pharaoh," I will pursue, I will satisfy my Lust,</HI> &amp;c. Or like the <HI>Assyrian,</HI> the Rod of God's Anger and Execution∣er of his Indignation, in whose Heart it was to destroy and cut off Nations not a few; and He said <HI>"Are not my Princes altogether Kings? shall I not do as I have done?</HI> Isai. x. 8, 10. This is for the <HI>Ax</HI> to boast it self against Him that heweth therewith, or for the <HI>Saw</HI> to magnify it self against him that saketh it. There neither <HI>can</HI> nor <HI>ought</HI> to be but one only Absolute Being, Isai. xlvi. 10. <HI>I am</HI> GOD, <HI>and there is none like me, I say, my Counsel shall stand and I will do all my Pleasure; I have spoken it and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed and also will do it.</HI> None may speak after this manner but only the GREAT KING, the One absolute <HI>Sovereign</HI> of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P N="5">5. GOD is the <HI>Great</HI> King, for He is the most <HI>perfect Being.</HI> And therefore is He indeed the <HI>Absolute</HI> LORD and <HI>Supream,</HI> because He is <HI>Perfect.</HI> For absolute Power should not be lodg∣ed in any Hand but His who is perfect. And it is the only Security, Felicity and Safety, of the Universe to have it lodged in his Hand; for He can't err or do wrong.</P>
<P>It is a wise and celebrated Saying of an <HI>Ancient,</HI> "That if we could find <HI>One Man</HI> far excelling all others in Wisdom and Goodness, He ought to have the Government". To be sure true Greatness lies in the Perfection of the Soul. From thence only may we look for a perfect Administration. Vice and Folly set in high Dignity are but the more mischeivous and the more exposed. God made <HI>Meses</HI> Great for Wisdom, Piety, Goodness and Justice, and set him at the Head of <HI>Is∣rael Samuel</HI>'s Name shines for ever, while <HI>Saul</HI>'s imprudent and irreligious Conduct sunk him below the meanest <HI>Israclite.</HI> But our Eyes behold the KING in his Grandeur and Beauty, while we meditate the perfect Goodness and Righteousness, the infinite Wisdom of GOD.</P>

1. GOD is <HI>Great</HI> in <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and therefore is the <HI>Great King.</HI> This princely Qualification makes Kings truly great. <HI>Solomon</HI> asked this of GOD, and He gave him <HI>a wise and un∣derstanding Heart,</HI> to do judgment and Justice. It made him <HI>Great</HI> in the Eyes of the Nations round about Him, and his Name great to the End of the World. The greatest Princes reverenc'd Him, and came from far to hear his Wisdom. But a Greater than <HI>Solomon</HI> is before us, <HI>the Only wise</HI> GOD. Wisdom and Strength are His. He gives to good and great Kings their <HI>Largeness of Heart.</HI> It was a high Compliment to such a Prince, <HI>'There is nothing hidden from my Lord the King, and he is wise as an Angel of</HI> GOD. But the wise and great GOD charges his very <HI>Angels</HI> with Folly. His Understanding is <HI>infinite,</HI> and therefore is He the <HI>Universal</HI> King. Known to Him are all his Works, all his Dominions, from the Beginning of the World. He looketh to the Ends of the Earth, and seeth under the whole Heaven. His Eyes are in every Place beholding the Evil and the Good. He puts Wisdom in Mans inward Parts, and giveth Understanding to the Heart. He gives Knowledge to them that know Understanding. This was <HI>the Spirit of</HI> GOD <HI>in Daniel, Light and Understanding and excellent Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. GOD is the <HI>Great King,</HI> for he is Great in <HI>Justice and Righteousness.</HI> Job. xxxvii. 23. <HI>Touching the</HI> ALMIGHTY <HI>we can∣not find Him cut; He is excellent in Judgment and in Plenty of Justice.</HI> Psalm lxxxix. 14. <HI>Justice and Judgment are the Habita∣tion of his Throne.</HI> This makes Kings great: Prov. xvi. 12. <HI>The Throne is established by Righteousness.</HI> This is the Glory of the SON <HI>of</HI> GOD, Psal. xlv. 6. <HI>The Sceptor of thy Kingdom is a right Scepter. Therefore is</HI> GOD <HI>Great in Zion, and High above all, Because the Kings strength leveth Judgment, he establishes Equity, he executeth Righteousness in Jacob: Exalt ye the</HI> LORD OUR GOD <HI>and worship at his Footstool, for the</HI> LORD OUR GOD <HI>is holy.</HI> Psalm xcix.</P>
<P><HI>Saul</HI>'s Injustice made him <HI>little: Why should the King sin a∣gainst his Servant? and whom did the King of Israel pursue after in the Wilderness? was it after a Flea?</HI> So much did he de∣base himself But <HI>Justice</HI> magnifies a Prince, as <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Judg∣ment magnified him: 1 Kings iii. 28. <HI>And all Israel heard of the Judgment which the King had judged, and they feared the King, for they saw that the Wisdom of</HI> GOD <HI>was in him, to do Judgment.</HI> This Prayer is therefore put into our Mouths for Kings and Princes, Psalm. lxxii. 1. <HI>Give the King thy Judgments, O</HI> GOD! <HI>and thy Righteousness to the Kings Son.</HI> If this be given, it will make a great King, a great Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003645_0014_10023BBC58AFEA70"/>
This is the Glory of the MESSIAH, as it was of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> a worthy <HI>Type</HI> of him, Isai. xxxii. 1. <HI>Behold a King shall reign in Righteousness, and Princes shall rule in Judgment, and a</HI> MAN <HI>shall be a hiding-place from the wind, and a Covert from the Tempest, and as Rivers of Waters in a dry Land, and as the shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land. Behold</HI> this admirable Work of GOD says the <HI>Prophet;</HI> admire this rare and great Thing in the Earth, this great Blessing to the World.</P>
<P>Such is the GREAT GOD to his Creatures, and such His <HI>Government</HI> over them. <HI>He loveth Righteousness and executeth Judgment in the Earth. Just and true are thy Ways, O King of Saints! There is none Holy as the</HI> LORD, <HI>for there is none beside</HI> HIM.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD is the Great King, for He is perfect in <HI>Goodness and Mercy.</HI> This is his GLORY. Thus he shewed his <HI>Face</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> and thus He proclaim'd his <HI>Name:</HI> Exod. xxxiv. 6. <HI>The</HI> LORD, <HI>the</HI> LORD GOD, <HI>merciful and gracious and abundant in Goodness.</HI> How great is a <HI>good King!</HI> Great in the eyes of God and Men! So an <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> would fill a Throne! so <HI>They</HI> shine upon their Thrones above.</P>
<P><HI>Mercy and Truth</HI> adorn and <HI>preserve Kings,</HI> uphold and blazen their Thrones. These render 'em <HI>God like.</HI> And all that is great and excellent in the Kingdom of Nature is but a meet Comparison, whereby to illustrate their high Excellency. 2 Sam. xxiii. 4. <HI>And he shall be like the Light of the Morning, and as the clear shining after Rain.</HI></P>
<P>GOD exercises Loving-kindness and Mercy in the Earth. His Goodness endureth continually. Every good and perfect Gift comes down from Him, the Father of Lights. <HI>There is none Good beside Him.</HI> How great is the Goodness which he has laid up for them that fear him, which he has wrought for them that trust in him! His <HI>Pardon</HI> is out to all the <HI>Trai∣tors</HI> against his Government, Crown and Dignity. He forgiveth Iniquity, Transgression and Sin: He keepeth Mercy for Thou∣sands. None are excepted, but all invited to repent. He waits to be gracious, and is a Long-suffering GOD. Dan. ix 9. <HI>To the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD <HI>belong Mercies and Forgivenesses, tho' we have rebelled against Him.</HI> Micah. vii. 18. <HI>Who is a</HI> GOD <HI>like unto Thee, that pardonest Iniquity, and passest by Transgression, and de∣lightest in Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have contemplated the <HI>Greatness</HI> of the LORD OUR GOD in his being the <HI>most perfect</HI> It is Wisdom Justice and
<PB N="13" REF="003645_0015_10023BC05BCA1708"/>Goodness that make Persons <HI>great,</HI> be They on higher Seats or lower Forms. But set the most perfect <HI>Man</HI> upon a Throne, and how would he Shine? Even the <HI>devant</HI> would be ready to fall down and <HI>worship</HI> this lively <HI>living Image of the</HI> DEITY. Or rather, They could not help admiring the GREAT GOD in him. 2 Samuel vii. 3. <HI>And Nathan said to the King, Go, do all that is in thy Heart, for</HI> GOD <HI>is with thee.</HI></P>
<P>There can be but ONE most perfect, and how much <HI>Great∣er</HI> must HE be than all other, that are finite and imperfect! Matth. v. ult. <HI>Our Father in Heaven is perfect.</HI> His therefore is <HI>the</HI> GREATNESS, <HI>and the Glory and the Majesty.</HI> Here there∣fore I will break off my Contemplation of the GREAT KING: For what can be added to that which is PERFECT? the Greatness of his Kingdom can't be justly celebrated in any Words below those of <HI>David,</HI> in his <HI>royal Psalm of Praise,</HI> cxlv.</P>
<P>I might add many more Words to what has been said of the <HI>Greatness of</HI> GOD's Dominion, and might well begin a∣new and cast the <HI>Argument</HI> into a various <HI>Method;</HI> GOD is great in the Kingdom of <HI>Nature and Providence,</HI> great in the King∣dom of his <HI>Grace,</HI> and greater yet in the Kingdom of his <HI>Glory:</HI> so Great that all things are <HI>little</HI> and as <HI>nothing</HI> before Him. But I must come to the USE.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is GOD a KING, and a GREAT KING? He is therefore <HI>greatly to be feared and had in Reverence in the Assembly of his Worshippers.</HI> Psalm. lxxxix. 7.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Argument</HI> in our <HI>Context,</HI> which <HI>arraigns</HI> the Worshippers of GOD for their <HI>Irreverence</HI> towards Him.</P>
<P><HI>Earthly Kings</HI> expect to be always treated with utmost Re∣gard and Respect; to be approached, spoken to and heard with great Reverence. Offer less to thy <HI>Governour</HI> will he be pleased with thee or accept thy Person? And shall the GREAT KING demand or accept less from us. Levit. x. 3. <HI>I will be sanctified by them that draw nigh me.</HI> Psalm xcv. 3, 6. <HI>For the</HI> LORD <HI>is a great</HI> GOD, <HI>and a great</HI> KING <HI>above all God O come, let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI> Hebrews xii. 24. <HI>Let us find Grace, whereby we may serve</HI> GOD <HI>acceptably with Reverence and godly Fear.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In all our <HI>Prayers and Supplications.</HI> If we had a Peti∣tion to present to our Earthly Prince, and might be admit∣ed to the Royal Presence to offer it; with what an awful Care should we do it? More especially if it were to cry to Him for our Life, or the Lives of our People▪ as when <HI>Esther</HI> had her
<PB N="14" REF="003645_0016_10023B6AAC583FC8"/>Request to make. With like and greater Apprehensions of the <HI>Majesty</HI> of GOD, should we pray to HIM in secret or in pub∣lick. We should think with our Selves, "Whom am I go∣ing to speak unto? and for what? — Is it to to the <HI>most High</HI> GOD, the King of Glory? for my Soul, and it's everlasting Interests? Wherewithal shall I come before the LORD? and bow my self before the most High GOD? O let not the LORD be angry that Dust and Ashes take upon them to speak unto Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. This great King is <HI>fearful in Praises.</HI> The LORD is Great <HI>and greatly to be praised,</HI> He is to be <HI>seared above all Gods.</HI> Neither Angels, nor Saints can praise Him <HI>according to his excel∣lent Greatness.</HI> Kings are commanded to serve Him with Fear and to rejoyce with Trembling The glorified Spirits that know his Greatness <HI>cover their Faces and fall down before the Throne,</HI> while they give him the Glory of His Holiness and Grace. Sec Isai. 1.1, — 5. Rev. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, — 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of this Great King must be read, preached and heard with great Reverence. Where the Word of a <HI>King</HI> is there is <HI>Power.</HI> When Kings speak, how are they listned to! <HI>The Voice of the</HI> LORD <HI>is full of Majesty. I will hear what</HI> GOD <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>will say. Listen ye Isles from far.</HI></P>
<P>He once spake by <HI>Angels,</HI> and the People quaked beneath the shaking Mountain. He came down that his Fear might fall on them, and He promited 'em from that Day to speak by the Mouth of Men. But what a great Thing is it to speak from the <HI>Great</HI> GOD, or to be spoken to in his Name? Preaching and Hearing are therefore awful Parts of Divine Worship. It should be to us as GOD Himself, the Great King, speaking from the excellent Glory. 1 Thess. ii. 13. <HI>Not as the Word of Men, but as it is indeed the Word of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Positive Laws and Institutions of the Great</HI> KING should be carefully and reverently observed. These are the <HI>Statutes</HI> of our GOD, respecting his publick Worship. In his Majesty, Wisdom, Holiness and Grace He has enjoyned them. They are few and of great Significance and Importance, for the Glory of God and the Benefit of Souls.</P>
<P N="1">1. In Honour of the <HI>Great</HI> KING of Heaven, and in Obe∣dience to Him, we must religiously keep his <HI>Sabbaths.</HI> There is a Portion of <HI>Time</HI> which He has seperated to Himself, from the Creation of Man upon the Earth. There is no proper Reverence of Him as our <HI>Creator</HI> Redeemer and Sanctifier without the reverend Observation hereof. Levi. xxvi. 2. <HI>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuary, I am the</HI> LORD
<PB N="15" REF="003645_0017_10023BC214750B98"/>Exod. xxxi. 13. <HI>Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep, for it is a Sign between Me and You thro'out your Generations that I am the</HI> LORD <HI>that doth Sanctify you.</HI> It is a weekly Act of Homage to GOD as the Great King and Governour of the World. Kings are required thus to honour the KING of all the Earth. Ezek. xlvi. 2, 4 <HI>The Burnt-offering which the Prince shall offer upon the Sabbath-day shall be six Lambs without Blemish.</HI> He must bring a princely Offering, and give a royal Example to all his Sub∣jects. The first Sabbath-breaker in the Camp of <HI>Israel</HI> died as a <HI>Traitor</HI> against the LORD his King. It was <HI>High Treason</HI> against the MAJESTY <HI>on High.</HI> He has no <HI>Birth-day</HI> for us to keep in Honour to his Name! but there is the Birth-day of this <HI>World</HI> of ours, and of <HI>Man</HI> upon it, and there is a Day wherein He raised up the SON OF MAN, <HI>the Prince of Life</HI> from the dead; and in solemn Remembrance of These He commands us to spend one Day in seven in Prayers and Praises to the Au∣thor of our Being, the GOD of our Salvation. Thus it is that the <HI>Kingdom of our</HI> GOD, <HI>and the Power of His</HI> CHRIST is perpetuated and made glorious on Earth. Thus it is that we obey and answer to that Divine Call to us, Psalm xxiv. ult. <HI>Lft up your Heads, O ye Gates, and he ye lift up ye Everlasting Doors, that the</HI> KING OF GLORY <HI>may come in.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In Reverence to GOD as the Great King of his Church, we awfully observe the holy Ordinance of <HI>Baptism.</HI> He may en∣joyn us what He will. Of old He gave to <HI>Abraham</HI> the Sign of Circumcision, and that day he circumcised Himself, his Son, and all the Men of his House. His Covenant was in their Flesh for an everlasting Covenant. When the Will of GOD was once declared, it had been high Presumption, a Contempt of His <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> to have disobeyed, tho' it was a humbling and painful Institution. Excision from God and from his People was the Penalty incurred. It was of special spiritual Significancy to 'em; Deut. x. 16. <HI>Circumcise the Foreskin of your Hearts.</HI> xxx. 6. <HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>will circumcise the Heart of your Seed to love Him, that thou mayest live.</HI> In like manner, the sacred <HI>Sacramental Washing with Water</HI> is significant of a Soul sprinkled from an evil Conscience. They are the Circumcision who worship GOD in the Spirit. Baptism is now the <HI>Livery of the Great King,</HI> which his Servants wear to signify their Relation to Him, and Dedication to his Service. Matth. xxviii. ult. <HI>Go teach all Nations baptizing them.</HI> The KING of the Church was Himself baptized, and the Heavens opened on the illustrious Occasion, and the SPIRIT descended as a Dove upon Him. The Mission of <HI>John</HI> was witnessed to from Heaven by the FATHER and the SPIRIT, and by the SON on Earth, <HI>He, the Elias of the New-Testament</HI> came baptizing with Water. It is a Solemnity much to be reverenc'd in the Christian Church to the End of the
<PB N="16" REF="003645_0018_10023BC3B15C2F48"/>World. CHRIST'S Yoke herein is light, a Law of easy and pleasant Observation; and he must be very unreasonable who like <HI>Naaman</HI> the Leper thinks much of the Injunction were it to wash <HI>seven times.</HI> 2 Kings v. 13.</P>
<P>In <HI>Baptism</HI> we recognize our <HI>Seed</HI> as Subjects of CHRIST'S Kingdom. Did our Earthly King summon us to <HI>inrol</HI> our Names, and those of our Children, that He might know Us and Them as Candidates for the Honours and Preferments of His Court, we should crowd it may be to enter our Names. Or should He send us a <HI>Garter</HI> to wear in Token of his Favour and Grace to us, we should be proud to put it on. With like Gratitude should Christians think of their <HI>Baptism,</HI> and bring their Offspring to the Waters.</P>
<P N="3">3. In Reverence and Obedience to the GREAT KING of the Church, we should be very careful in our Observation of the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> It is the Memorial of our CRUCIFIED KING, for so ran the Inscription over his Cross, "JESUS <HI>of Nazareth King of the Jews</HI> Him hath GOD set KING upon his holy Hill. He is LORD to the Glory of the FATHER. And as he went to his Cross he left us this Law, "<HI>This do ye in Re∣membrance of Me.</HI></P>
<P>The same GOD and KING that requir'd of old the Ordinance of the <HI>Passover,</HI> has appointed now this of the <HI>Supper;</HI> to give Him the Glory of his <HI>Redeeming Love,</HI> and to receive from Him a publick Token and Pledge of it. Shall we refuse? And say as in our <HI>Context," The Table of the Lord is contemptible!</HI> GOD fo bid. Is the Table of a great <HI>King</HI> so accounted among Men? Do or dare Men refuse to wait there, when required to do so? Or do they not think it a great <HI>Honour</HI> and Pleasure to be call'd up to it? And with what <HI>Reverence</HI> do they behave, who stand about their Princes Table? How do they dress and prepare on such Occasion? Yet in Religion Men too often are the Reverse of all this. The Case and Crime is justly re∣presented in the <HI>Parable</HI> of the KING that made <HI>a Marriage Supper</HI> for his SON, Matth. xxii. Init. But those that were <HI>bidden</HI> made their paltry and criminal <HI>Excuses,</HI> till the <HI>King was wroth</HI> and protested they should never taste of his Feast. We read again of His coming in to see his <HI>Guests,</HI> and how He chal∣leng'd him that came without a <HI>Wedding Garment,</HI> and cast him out into utter Darkness. It teaches us the equal Irre∣verence of those that <HI>neglect</HI> and those that <HI>profane</HI> the Ordi∣nance of the <HI>Supper.</HI> Many wont come at all at the Call of their KING, and too many come carelesly and without Reve∣rence and Fear. The Institutions of our GOD may be prostituted by Humane Laws, and many an unfit polluted Soul find him∣self
<PB N="17" REF="003645_0019_10023BC5F83242D0"/>under an evil kind of Constraint to approach them for carnal and filthy Ends: For the sake of their daily Bread they may sometimes unwillingly eat of the Bread of their GOD and drink of his Cup. And as long as partaking of the <HI>Sacrament</HI> is made a <HI>Test</HI> of Loyalty to our <HI>Earthly King,</HI> and a <HI>Qualification</HI> for Offices in Fleets and Armies, it will in this wicked World be necessarily profan'd to the Dishonour of the KING OF GLORY. HE has made it an <HI>Oath of our Allegiance to Himself,</HI> and we must take and make it with godly Fear; <HI>Swearing</HI> to Him in Truth, in Righteousness and in Judgment. Has our GREAT KING said to us, "<HI>Do this in Remembrance of Me!</HI> And shall we not do it? And He has said, Do it not <HI>unworthily!</HI> lest ye <HI>eat and drink Judgment to your Selves.</HI> We should be equally deterred from the Neglect, and from the careless Performance of the Duty.</P>
<P>But this for the <HI>first Use,</HI> which answers to the mighty <HI>Rea∣son</HI> of the Words as they ly in our <HI>Context:</HI> Is GOD a Great KING? then with what <HI>Reverence and godly Fear</HI> is HE to be <HI>worshipped</HI> in one Ordinance of his House and in another? I shall be <HI>shorter</HI> in the remaining <HI>Inferences.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Is GOD a Great King? <HI>how great is the Evil of the least Sin!</HI> We must ever estimate the Evil of Sin from the Great∣ness of the DIVINE MAJESTY. <HI>David's</HI> Heart smote him for cutting off <HI>Sauls</HI> Skirt, so should our Hearts smite us for the least Appearance of Sinning against the LORD our King. In every wilful Act of sin we are guilty of stretching forth our Hand against the KING of Heaven, and striking at his Crown and Government. Shall not <HI>Shimei</HI> die (said faithful <HI>Abishai</HI>) that has <HI>rail'd</HI> at and <HI>curs'd</HI> my Lord the King? We in Effect do <HI>this</HI> to the KING <HI>of Glory,</HI> and <HI>cast Stones</HI> at Him, in every sin we commit against the LORD OUR GOD. Shall a <HI>dead Dog</HI> do this and live! Sinners are <HI>no better</HI> before that BLESSED BEING whom their Sins bark at and blaspheme. A light Repentance can never suffice for the least sin against the Di∣vine Majesty. 1 Sam. ii. 25. <HI>If a Man sin against the</HI> LORD <HI>who can entreat for Him?</HI> What Atonement can be made for an infinite Offence? We read of some, who being doubly damn'd, <HI>do curse their</HI> GOD <HI>and</HI> KING, <HI>and look upward.</HI> Isai. viii. ult.</P>
<P N="3">3. If GOD be a great King, He can <HI>greatly Pardon.</HI> And it is therefore a great Thing for Him to pardon the least Sin. He cannot lightly pardon the Transgression of his royal and perfect Law. The glorious Honour of his Kingdom forbids it. He cannot de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Himself. But saving the Rights of his own Wisdom, Justice and Holiness, what cannot the Great King do?

A∣bishai</HI> wondered at <HI>David</HI>'s forgiving <HI>Shimei.</HI> But what was <HI>David</HI>'s Throne if compar'd with GOD'S. <HI>To the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>belong Forgivenesses.</HI> This is the <HI>Glory</HI> wherein he passes before us Sinners.</P>
<P N="4">4. What a great thing is it, for the GREAT KING of Hea∣ven, to give <HI>his</HI> OWN SON to save us! His <HI>Only-begotten and Eternal</HI> SON! <HI>the Brightness of his</HI> Glory, and the express Image of his Person! by <HI>Whom He made the World, and by Him all things consist.</HI> What manner of Love and Grace is this to Rebel dust and ashes! Had all the <HI>Angels</HI> in Heaven, and all the <HI>Kings</HI> upon Earth, been offer'd up in one Sacrifice, these glo∣rious Lives had been as nothing in Comparison of that single Life of the SON OF GOD in our Nature. A LIFE worth all these ten thousand times over.</P>
<P>It was accepted as a great thing by the GREAT GOD, when <HI>Abraham</HI> offer'd up his beloved <HI>Isaac</HI> to Him, at his Word, for a Burnt-Offering. But may we name it here? by no means. It was a more surprising thing and horrible, when the <HI>King of Moah</HI> driven to Despair by the victorious Arms of <HI>Israel,</HI> took his <HI>Eldest Son</HI> that should have reigned after him, and <HI>slew</HI> him on the Wall of the City. A salvage and brutish. Act! from Rage at his powerful Enemies, and worthy of their Detestation. But the Love of GOD in giving his <HI>Dear Son,</HI> to save his Enemies, is worthy of the Adorations of <HI>Angels</HI> and Men, while <HI>Devils</HI> gnash their Teeth and melt away.</P>
<P N="5">5. What <HI>perfect Obedience</HI> is due from us to the <HI>Laws</HI> of the GREAT KING, and what <HI>Submission</HI> to Him in all his <HI>Provi∣dences!</HI> GOD is absolutely to be obeyed and submitted to in all things. He is so in Heaven and it should be so on Earth. "<HI>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</HI> It was a wise and righteous Order, given by the Greatest Man on Earth, Ezra vii. 23, 26. <HI>Whatsoever is commanded by the</HI> GOD <HI>of Heaven, let diligently be done; for why should there be Wrath against us?</HI> GOD's <HI>Judgments</HI> must be resigned to with a perfect Acquiescence. As <HI>Shimei</HI> answered to <HI>Solomon, "The saying is good: As my Lord the King hath said, so will thy sevant do.</HI> We are happy un∣der a perfect Government. <HI>As for</HI> GOD, <HI>his Work is perfect.</HI> This is enough to keep us always easie, thankful, joyful. <HI>Shall he that hateth Right govern, or is there Wickedness in the</HI> MOST HIGH? <HI>What Right have I (said injured Mephibesheth) to cry
<PB N="19" REF="003645_0021_10023BCA01339E00"/>to the King?</HI> Our Times and Lives are in GOD's Hand. It is the LORD! let Him do what seemeth him good.</P>
<P N="6">6. Is GOD a Great King? <HI>to him let us swear and to Him perform our Vows.</HI> Because He is the <HI>Greatest</HI> we swear by his Name, and He swears by Himself. Jerem. iv. 2. <HI>Thou shall swear, "the</HI> LORD <HI>liveth! in Truth and Righteousness: and the Nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him they shall glory.</HI> We must swear Allegiance and Fidelity to GOD, be∣cause He is our <HI>King.</HI> So we have done in our <HI>Baptism,</HI> and so we do <HI>as often as we eat of his Bread and drink of his Cup.</HI> The <HI>Sacraments</HI> of Religion are <HI>Oaths</HI> of Loyalty and Sub∣jection to CHRIST. And in all our solemn Prayers and <HI>Pro∣fessions,</HI> and occasional Vows, we bind our Souls, as by <HI>Oath,</HI> to GOD. "<HI>O my Soul, thou hast said unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>Thou art my</HI> LORD. This is the Demand of the GREAT KING, and his Glory requires it: Isai. xlv. 23 <HI>I have sworn by</HI> MY SELF, <HI>that unto Me every Knee shall bow, every Tongue shall swear.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Is GOD a Great King? there is certainly <HI>a Tribute</HI> due to Him out of all that we are and have: from our Minds and Hearts, from our Lips and Hands, out of our Estates, and according to our Endowments and respective Stations. GOD is the King of <HI>Souls,</HI> and it is the Homage of the <HI>Heart</HI> that He requires and values. He gives us also our <HI>Wealth</HI> and claims an <HI>Offering</HI> out of that. "<HI>Honour the</HI> LORD <HI>with thy Substance, and with the First-fruits of all thine Increase. Kings</HI> are thus served, yea supported by their Subjects, and their <HI>Greatness</HI> depends on it. But the GREAT KING receives but of <HI>His own</HI> from us, and what He first gives to us. This, as was said before, is the <HI>Greatness and Glory and Majesty of His Kingdom, and His Exaltation above all:</HI> Both <HI>Riches and Honour</HI> come of Him, and in His Hand it is to <HI>make Great</HI> and to give Strength unto all! <HI>David</HI> therefore spake before the LORD, in the Day when <HI>He</HI> and <HI>his Princes</HI> made their princely Of∣ferings toward the <HI>Temple; But who am I, or what is my Peo∣ple</HI> that We should offer any thing to the GREAT GOD? <HI>for all things come of Thee and of thine own have we given Thee.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Let us <HI>pray for, rejoice in,</HI> and every way we can <HI>contri∣bute unto the Glory of</HI> GOD'S <HI>Kingdom.</HI> AS CHRIST has taught us to pray, "<HI>Father in Heaven thy Kingdom come!</HI> and to as∣cribe <HI>the Kingdom Power and Glory to</HI> GOD. O what an Ho∣nour and Glory, Comfort and Joy will it be to us, if <HI>we</HI> may serve to advance the Kingdom of CHRIST in this World and a better, Now and for Evermore! <HI>Ministers</HI> in His <HI>Churches,</HI> ministring to the Conversion of Souls, and to their Subjection
<PB N="20" REF="003645_0022_10023BCD30C5C760"/>to the Gospel; to the everlasting Glory of GOD, in their E∣ternal Salvation: <HI>Christians</HI> in their private Relations, in their Neighbourhoods, and more especially in their own <HI>Families:</HI> that the Souls under their Care may come into the Kingdom of GOD'S Grace, into his Church, and that the GREAT KING of the World may have Honour and Service from us and ours; a Revenue of Praise and Obedience thro' Time and Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed be the Kingdom of our</HI> LORD JESUS! <HI>Peace in Heaven and Glory in the Highest!</HI></P>
