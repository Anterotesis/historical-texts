<Q><BIBL>Job XVI. 6.</BIBL>
<P><HI>Tho' I speak, my Grief is not asswaged; and tho' I forbear, what am I eased?</HI></P></Q>
<P>IT is Probable, and more than so, That every Person in this Assembly of <HI>Zion,</HI> has <HI>Bitter Griefs</HI> that may be complain∣ed of: There is not an <HI>Heart</HI> but what <HI>knows its own Bitterness.</HI> But it is as probable, that the <HI>Griefs</HI> of many People are <HI>Incurable</HI> ones; <HI>Griefs</HI> hopelefs of any <HI>Cure</HI> in this World; There is nothing that can be done to <HI>Cure</HI> them. It may be said unto them, as in Jer. XXX. 12. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Thy Bruise as Incurable, and thy Wound is Griev∣ous.</HI></P>
<P>This CASE, <HI>What shall be done
<PB N="4" REF="001691_0003_0FB52A2596F75948"/>with Griefs, when there is no Cu∣ring of them?</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Case,</HI> which I make no doubt, very many are concerned in; A <HI>Case,</HI> which I make no doubt, may be very Pro∣fitably, and very Seasonably dis∣coursed on.</P>
<P>My Discourse upon the Case, will have an agreeable Introducti∣on, in pointing you to an Instance of it. The celebrated <HI>Job,</HI> was one in whom you find it instanced. It is well noted by the famous Jew <HI>Maimonides,</HI> That the Book of <HI>Job</HI> Was written, to Establish us in the grand Article of Divine Provi∣dence. And the <HI>Mahometans</HI> them∣selves, look upon it, as written to Instruct us in this particular My∣stery of that Providence; That God may Afflict those, whom He has a great Favour for. He who writes the Ancient Commentaries on this Book, under the Name of <HI>Origen,</HI> says, that he found this Tradition, <HI>In Antiquorum dictis,</HI> That <HI>Moses</HI> beholding the Cala∣mities
<PB N="5" REF="001691_0004_0FB52A27F1DDAFA0"/>of his Brethren in <HI>Egypt,</HI> made a Present of this History un∣to them, to Encourage their Ex∣pectations, that if they suffered Pa∣tiently, God would in the latter End bestow such a Deliverance upon them, as He did upon His Patient Servant <HI>Job.</HI> And in like manner, it was the Custome of the Primitive Christians, when they visited one another in their perso∣nal Calamities, to Read a Lesson out of <HI>Job</HI> in their Visits, for the Support of their Minds under what had befallen them.</P>
<P>It seems, I do no New Thing, when I call in the Patriarch <HI>Job,</HI> to serve the Intention, of giving some Direction about <HI>Incurable Ca∣lamities.</HI> The Afflicted Patriarch here Complains of his <HI>Grief,</HI> as be∣ing <HI>Incurable.</HI> Says he, <HI>Tho' I speak, my Grief is not asswaged; and tho' I forbear; what am I eased.</HI>
<Q>Neither <HI>Speaking</HI> nor <HI>Silence,</HI> will do any thing for my <HI>Cure.</HI> Let me try what <HI>Methods</HI> I will, my <HI>Grief</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001691_0005_0FB52A2956077720"/>will remain without a <HI>Cure.</HI></Q> Per∣haps, it was not without some Eye to this Passage, that <HI>Elibu</HI> charged <HI>Job,</HI> in Chap. XXXIV. 6. with saying, <HI>My Wound is Incurable.</HI> Be that as it will, my DOCTRINE will be Incontestible.</P>
<P><HI>The Children of Men are frequently troubled with Griefs which cannot be Cured.</HI></P>
<P>Many People have such <HI>Griefs</HI> as they have little hopes to <HI>Asswage</HI> and have <HI>eased,</HI> as long as they are in this <HI>present Evil World.</HI> Many People meet with <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which they can't hope to see re∣moved; but must look to <HI>bear</HI> them as well as they <HI>can;</HI> it may be, as long as they <HI>live.</HI> The <HI>Weeping Pro∣phet</HI> said of the share which he must have in the Woful Things that came upon his Country; Jer. X. 19. <HI>This is a Grief, and I must bear it.</HI> We see many a <HI>Grief,</HI> which there is no Redressing of; We must
<PB N="7" REF="001691_0006_0FB52A2E2060E120"/><HI>bear</HI> it. But the Case now is, <HI>How to bear it?</HI> This is to be spoken to.</P>
<P N="1">I. And it will contribute a little unto it, for us to lay down in the first Place, this more general Ob∣servation. <HI>Griefs must come;</HI> There are <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which in <HI>this World</HI> must be met withal. They are in the very Nature of the <HI>Cli∣mate.</HI> It is the Condition of <HI>Man∣kind;</HI> the <HI>common Lot,</HI> the <HI>constant Fate,</HI> which every <HI>Mothers Son</HI> must look for: A Condition of Afflicti∣on, which is <HI>not Joyous but Grievous.</HI> We Read, Job XIV. 1. <HI>Man that is born of a Woman, is of short Life, and full of Trouble.</HI></P>
<P>We will a little Enquire after the <HI>Cause</HI> of the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> that are appointed for us. For, <HI>Is there not a Cause?</HI> My Brethren, 'Tis not a meer <HI>Chance</HI> that brings our <HI>Griefs.</HI> Let us leave it unto the <HI>Philistines</HI> to say, <HI>It is a Chance that happens unto us.</HI> To ascribe our <HI>Grievous Things</HI> unto a <HI>Blind For∣tune;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001691_0007_0FB52A2F56829E78"/>to make no more of it than this, <HI>It was my hard Fortune;</HI> 'tis a very Foolish and Faulty <HI>Blindness.</HI> There is no <HI>Sense,</HI> and as little <HI>Grace,</HI> in the Expression, tho' it be a very frequent one. I remember, the Holy one threatens His Peo∣ple; Lev. XXVI. 24. <HI>If ye walk contrary unto me.</HI> The Original Word signifies, not, <HI>Contrariety,</HI> but, <HI>Contingency.</HI> The Learned Jews Ex∣plain it with such a Reading, <HI>If ye walk in the way of Chance.</HI> And who do so? They most Emphati∣cally, who don't look above <HI>Chance</HI> in the <HI>Events</HI> which in their <HI>Walk</HI> they meet withal. They who don't see and own the <HI>Providence</HI> of God in all Events. Of such People it is threatned by God. That He will <HI>Walk in the way of Chance</HI> with them, and will regard their Prayers no more than if there were nothing but a <HI>Chance</HI> to Govern their Af∣fairs. But,</P>
<P>First. Our <HI>Sin</HI> is the Cause of our <HI>Grief.</HI> Our <HI>Sin</HI> has made us <HI>worthy</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001691_0008_0FB52A31B5455FF8"/>of <HI>Grievous Things.</HI> 'Tis to Cha∣stise us for our <HI>Sin,</HI> that the <HI>Justice</HI> of Heaven dispences to us all our <HI>Grievous Things.</HI> Whenever any <HI>Grief</HI> befalls us, it may be said unto us, as in Jer. IV. 18. <HI>Thy Way and thy Doings have procured these Things un∣to thee; This is thy Wickedness.</HI> It was by <HI>Sin,</HI> that the <HI>Curse</HI> of Hea∣ven was first brought upon the Earth. In those Terms was the <HI>Curse</HI> denounced; Gen. III. 17, 18. <HI>Cursed is the Ground for thy sake; in Sorrow shalt thou Eat of it all the Days of thy Life. Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring forth unto thee.</HI> All the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> that Embitter our Lives, are the <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Thistles,</HI> which the Earth does bring forth unto us. No Corner of the Earth is free from them. The <HI>Cottage</HI> has them; the <HI>Palace</HI> also has them. The <HI>First Adams World</HI> is always full of <HI>Grievous Things;</HI> Ever a Stranger to <HI>uninterrupted Prosperity.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Vain</HI> Thing to flatter our selves. <HI>This World</HI> will be always
<PB N="10" REF="001691_0009_0FB52A3315FFD218"/>filled with <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation.</HI> In∣deed our <HI>Second Adam</HI> will bring us into a <HI>Better World.</HI> In the <HI>World to come,</HI> we read, Rev. XXI. 4. <HI>There shall be no more Death, neither Sorrow nor Crying:</HI> And Rev. XXII. 3. <HI>There shall be no more Curses.</HI> But until we come into <HI>that World,</HI> we shall al∣ways have some <HI>Fruits</HI> of the <HI>Curse</HI> to Conflict withal; some <HI>Grievous Things</HI> always attending of us. Ah, <HI>Sin, Sin;</HI> Thou art the <HI>Distresser of the Nations!</HI></P>
<P>A very plain Inference I now see so lying before me, that there is indeed no shunning of it. I Infer, Certainly, our <HI>Sin</HI> ought now to be our <HI>Grief.</HI> Oh! make it thy <HI>Grief,</HI> and except what the Blood of thy Saviour shall bring unto thee, do not ask for any thing, that may <HI>Asswage</HI> or <HI>Ease,</HI> a <HI>Grief</HI> that will not work thy <HI>Death,</HI> as every other will, but will save thee from it. If <HI>Sin</HI> bring <HI>all</HI> our <HI>Grief,</HI> certainly then <HI>Sin</HI> should be our <HI>greatest Grief.</HI> It becomes every one of us
<PB N="11" REF="001691_0015_0FB52A3FD8079898"/>say with him; Psal. XXXVIII. 18. <HI>I will be sorry for my Sin.</HI> We Read of such a Blessed Thing, as <HI>A Godly Sorrow, working Repentance to Salvation which is not to be Repen∣ted of.</HI> May every <HI>Grief</HI> which trou∣bles us, be turned into that <HI>Channel:</HI> A <HI>Grief,</HI> because we have <HI>sinned,</HI> &amp; we have by our <HI>Sin</HI> provoked the Holy One to send our <HI>Grief</HI> upon us. May all our <HI>Grievous Things</HI> cause us to Reflect on our <HI>Sins,</HI> &amp; fill us with <HI>Grievus Thoughts</HI> because of our <HI>Sins.</HI> My Brethren, I am so far from any Wish to see this <HI>Grief cured</HI> in you, that I wish it may be ever growing in you as long as you live; and that it may Accompany you to the last Moment of your Lives. O <HI>Dye</HI> in the midst of this <HI>Grief;</HI> and so, <HI>Enter into the Joy of your Lord.</HI> It is a <HI>Grief</HI> that will <HI>End</HI> in a <HI>Joy</HI> which will never have an <HI>End!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. But, who was the <HI>Father of Sin?</HI> Give him his <HI>Due;</HI> He must be brought in, as having an Hand
<PB N="12" REF="001691_0016_0FB52A4217B25090"/>in the <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which Dar∣ken the World. <HI>Satan</HI> has a mighty Hand in them; Satan, the <HI>Prince of this World;</HI> Satan, the <HI>Ruler of the Darkness of this World.</HI> That <HI>Angel of Death,</HI> by the Permission of a just God, sills this World with <HI>Griev∣ous Things,</HI> and with <HI>Deadly</HI> Ones. When <HI>Grievous Things</HI> befel the good People of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> our Savi∣our told them, <HI>The Divel</HI> was the Doer of them. <HI>Satan,</HI> with his <HI>Le∣gions</HI> of wicked Spirits, having lost his own Comforts, is full of <HI>Envy</HI> at ours. By our <HI>First Sin,</HI> we fell under his <HI>Dominion;</HI> Oh! what a <HI>Grievous</HI> one! By every <HI>New Sin,</HI> especially if it be a <HI>Gross</HI> one, we give him a fresh Advantage to ob∣tain a Commission for our further Annoyance. We Read, Joh. VIII. 44. <HI>He was a Murderer from the Be∣ginning.</HI> And who can tell, what <HI>Grievous Things</HI> are done, by the Influence and Energy of that <HI>Mur∣derer</HI> upon the sinful Children of Men! The Ancient Pagans had
<PB N="13" REF="001691_0017_0FB52A4397B5B7A8"/>their Minds much exercised upon that Question, <HI>What was the Origin of Evil;</HI> Or, <HI>Whence Evil came in upon us?</HI> There was a Tradition among them, and a very old one it was, That there were Two first Prin∣ciples; One called <HI>Oromazes,</HI> who might be resembled unto Light; Another called, <HI>Arimanius,</HI> who might be resembled unto <HI>Darkness;</HI> the one a <HI>God,</HI> the other a <HI>Daemou.</HI> The one lodged this World, like an <HI>Egg</HI> under the shell of his Fa∣vour; the other broke and pierc'd the Shell, and insinuated a Mix∣ture of <HI>Evil</HI> into all that is Good. A Tradition that contain'd in it some notable Reliques of Truth: <HI>God,</HI> the Maker of the World, and the Author of all <HI>Good; Satan,</HI> the Spoiler of the World, and the Foun∣tain of all <HI>Evil.</HI> The Result is, That the <HI>Grief</HI> of Mankind, is the Delight of Satan; What <HI>Grieves</HI> us, does Gladden him. He has no Pleasure, but that of an <HI>Executioner</HI> in <HI>Grievous Things</HI> upon a World,
<PB N="14" REF="001691_0018_0FB52A45D6E90938"/>which alas, is always too worthy of them.</P>
<P>And here again, I could not but see an Inference, that looks Black upon some among the Children of Men. I infer, To be <HI>pleas'd</HI> because our Neighbours are <HI>griev'd,</HI> this is a Satanic Disposition. The Chil∣dren of Men, who love to make or see others <HI>Miserable;</HI> I shall but speak <HI>Scripturally</HI> of them, if I say, they are too like the <HI>Children of the Divel;</HI> They have the Image of <HI>Sa∣tan</HI> very plain upon them. We may say, <HI>In this the Children of God are Manifest, and the Children of the Di∣vel.</HI> The <HI>Children of God;</HI> these are <HI>full of all Goodness;</HI> like their Fa∣ther, they <HI>are Good,</HI> they <HI>do Good;</HI> they Rejoice in the Prosperity of their Neighbours. The <HI>Groans</HI> of the <HI>Miserable,</HI> are a Music to none but <HI>Satan,</HI> and his Children. In∣deed, there may be the <HI>Triumphs</HI> of the Righteous, in the <HI>Ruines</HI> of the Wicked. But still the <HI>Triumphs</HI> have the <HI>Sorrows</HI> of a Gracious and
<PB N="15" REF="001691_0010_0FB52A35578D1938"/>to say with him; Psal. XXXVIII. 18. <HI>I will be sorry for my Sin.</HI> We Read of such a Blessed Thing, as <HI>A Godly Sorrow, working Repentance to Salvation which is not to be Repen∣ted of.</HI> May every <HI>Grief</HI> which trou∣bles us, be turned into that <HI>Channel:</HI> A <HI>Grief,</HI> because we have <HI>sinned,</HI> &amp; we have by our <HI>Sin</HI> provoked the Holy One to send our <HI>Grief</HI> upon us. May all our <HI>Grievous Things</HI> cause us to Reflect on our <HI>Sins,</HI> &amp; fill us with <HI>Grievus Thoughts</HI> because of our <HI>Sins.</HI> My Brethren, I am so far from any Wish to see this <HI>Grief cured</HI> in you, that I wish it may be ever growing in you as long as you live; and that it may Accompany you to the last Moment of your Lives. O <HI>Dye</HI> in the midst of this <HI>Grief;</HI> and so, <HI>Enter into the Joy of your Lord.</HI> It is a <HI>Grief</HI> that will <HI>End</HI> in a <HI>Joy</HI> which will never have an <HI>End!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. But, who was the <HI>Father of Sin?</HI> Give him his <HI>Due;</HI> He must be brought in, as having an Hand
<PB N="16" REF="001691_0011_0FB52A36D604B800"/>pensations of a Divine and most Glorious <HI>Providence.</HI> Whoever, or whatever <HI>Grieves</HI> us, by <HI>taking away</HI> what is dear unto us, we must say, <HI>'Tis the Lord who has taken away!</HI> Whatever <HI>Instruments</HI> may <HI>Grievs</HI> us, they are but <HI>Instruments.</HI> We may say, <HI>The Lord has bidden them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grievous Things</HI> which befal the <HI>Reprobate</HI> part of Mankind; These are the <HI>Punishments,</HI> which God in His Holy <HI>Providence</HI> does inflict upon them. In these <HI>Griev∣ous Things</HI> He restrains them from such Outrages, as wou'd else break up <HI>Humane Society.</HI> In these <HI>Grievous Things</HI> He lays them up in those <HI>Fetters,</HI> and those <HI>Dungeons,</HI> that are to go before their final Execution.</P>
<P>And then, the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> which befal the People of God, belong to the <HI>Discipline,</HI> wherewith His Holy <HI>Providence</HI> does prepare them for their Eternal Happiness. By these <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> He weans them from a World, in which they would else be too willing to Abide,
<PB N="17" REF="001691_0019_0FB52A4755F6ECC0"/>and carry on multiplied <HI>Idolatries;</HI> He kills the Weeds of those <HI>Cor∣ruptions</HI> that would unqualify them for His Kingdom. He awakens them to the <HI>Things that are Holy and Just and Good.</HI> By these <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> He Humbles them, He Quickens them, He Ripens them for Heaven; He fits them for the <HI>Inheritance</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly Places</HI> re∣served for them. The Things <HI>which for the present are not Joyous but Griev∣ous,</HI> do afterwards yield the <HI>Peacea∣ble Fruits of Righteousness</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>From this there will be an In∣ference, that is very Obvious. I Infer, We have to do with <HI>God,</HI> as often as any thing that is <HI>Grievous</HI> occurs unto us. O all you that are in any <HI>Grief,</HI> Remember this; <HI>God</HI> orders it, <HI>God</HI> appoints it; You have to do with <HI>God</HI> in every <HI>Grief.</HI> To every one of 'your' <HI>Grievous Things</HI> you may say, <HI>Thou couldest have had no Power against me, if God had not given it.</HI> You have no <HI>Cross,</HI> but such as <HI>God</HI> has laid upon you.
<PB N="18" REF="001691_0012_0FB52A3930628920"/>'Tis impossible for me to com∣mend unto you a more useful Con∣templation.</P>
<P N="2">II. We may now go on to ob∣serve more particularly; Many of the <HI>Griefs</HI> that come, are such as <HI>cannot be cured.</HI> We meet with some <HI>Grievous Things</HI> whereof 'tis a vain thing to expect a <HI>Cure.</HI> We have <HI>Griefs,</HI> which will not be <HI>asswaged</HI> by <HI>Speaking,</HI> or <HI>eased</HI> by <HI>Silence.</HI> They are altogether <HI>Incurable.</HI></P>
<P>First. Be sure, we have this <HI>Grief</HI> that cannot be <HI>cured;</HI> That our <HI>state in general, must be a state of Grief;</HI> a state liable to <HI>Grievous Things.</HI> There are many <HI>Grievous Things</HI> that are the <HI>unavoidable Por∣tion</HI> of Mankind. It is our <HI>Portion,</HI> and there is no Avoiding, there is no Preventing, there is no Escap∣ing of it. Come, let us do like the Wise Man, in Eccl. III. 10. <HI>See the Travel which God hath given unto the Sons of Men, to be Exercised in it.</HI> There are the <HI>Laws</HI> of our <HI>present state,</HI> which are less to be altered,
<PB N="19" REF="001691_0013_0FB52A3A95FE8228"/>than the <HI>Laws of the Medes and Per∣sians; Laws</HI> which oblige us to many. Humbling and Creepling Circumstances. And what art thou, <HI>O proud Worm,</HI> that thou shouldest propose for thy sake any Alterati∣on of them? <HI>Shall the Earth be for∣saken for thee, and shall the Rock be removed out of his Place?</HI> Vain Man, Rash Man, Tho' thou <HI>tear thy self in thine Anger,</HI> it shall not be done. A state of <HI>Grievous Things</HI> here, 'tis <HI>Unalterable,</HI> 'tis <HI>Unalterable!</HI> I shall speak very Comprehensively, when I say, <HI>Every Condition</HI> of Life, must have <HI>Temptations</HI> attending of it. There is no Condition free from its <HI>peculiar Temptations.</HI> Very much of our <HI>Work</HI> in the World, is to <HI>Watch</HI> against the <HI>Temptations</HI> in it. <HI>O our God, let them not be too hard for us!</HI> I go on; It is a <HI>Grief,</HI> that we must Labour under such <HI>Frailty,</HI> and such <HI>Meanness,</HI> and such <HI>Nece∣ssities,</HI> as the Constitution of our Bodies does bring upon us; A <HI>Grief;</HI> but there is no <HI>curing</HI> of it. It is a
<PB N="20" REF="001691_0014_0FB52A3E569908C0"/><HI>Grief,</HI> that it is <HI>appointed for Men <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Die;</HI> and after we have, like the <HI>Sparks,</HI> mounted up for a little while, we must anon sink, and fall down into the common Heap of Ashes: A <HI>Grief,</HI> But there is no <HI>Curing</HI> of it. It is a <HI>Grief,</HI> that we must be always liable to <HI>Grievous Things;</HI> The <HI>Wheel</HI> always upon the <HI>Turn;</HI> and no Man know a Day aforehand what a <HI>Day may bring forth.</HI> Say, This is my <HI>Grief;</HI> I am <HI>Feeble,</HI> and <HI>Mortal,</HI> and Jog on from Day to Day, <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Uncertain</HI> every Day what may come upon me, in the Day that is coming on; But it is <HI>Incurable:</HI> It cannot be otherwise. A state liable to <HI>Griev∣ous Things,</HI> is call'd, 1 Cor. X. 13. <HI>What is common to Man.</HI> O Man, Be not so Impertinent as to Dream of <HI>Curing</HI> and shunning, <HI>what is common to Man.</HI> Among the <HI>Incura∣bles</HI> of our <HI>present State,</HI> wonder not that I omit the <HI>Body of Death</HI> which will cleave to us till the <HI>Death of our Body;</HI> An Inclination to <HI>Sin,</HI> a Pro|
<PB N="21" REF="001691_0020_0FB52A48D77B5A40"/>pensity to <HI>Sin,</HI> which will be a <HI>Le∣prosy</HI> cleaving to us, till the Walls of our <HI>Clay-Tabernacle</HI> be all taken down. My Reason for this Omi∣ssion, is, Because I propose the Mention of no <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> but such as we ought to <HI>bear Patiently,</HI> and be Reconcil'd unto. Now out <HI>Sin</HI> is a <HI>Grief,</HI> never to be born with any <HI>Patience.</HI> We are always to be <HI>Groaning</HI> under it. It will be no Offence unto Heaven to say, <HI>Lord, I cannot bear it!</HI> The most a∣greeable Strain under it will al∣ways be that; <HI>Lord, I am Oppressed, undertake for me!</HI></P>
<P>But this Advice cannot leave us, without an Admonition; <HI>Heaven∣born Souls,</HI> Long for <HI>Heaven!</HI> Since the <HI>present State</HI> will and must be a <HI>Grievous</HI> one, e'en bear it, as long as God shall please to keep you in it. But then, methinks, the <HI>Future state</HI> should be <HI>Preferr'd</HI> with you; should be <HI>Desir'd</HI> by you: A <HI>Better state,</HI> you may depend upon it. Syrs, You shall not therein <HI>do, ac∣cording
<PB N="22" REF="001691_0021_0FB52A4B3065ADD0"/>to the Things which you do here this Day.</HI> Nor shall you therein suf∣fer such Abasements, and such En∣cumbrances, and such Inconveni∣encies, as are now the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> of your Pilgrimage. O de∣termine this; <HI>I shall never be well, till I come to Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There is a Variety of more <HI>particular Circumstances</HI> in our state of Life, which will cause <HI>Grief</HI> unto us; but the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> will be found such as cannot be <HI>Cured.</HI> In the <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> we must meet with many Things, which we could very much wish were otherwise than they are. But our <HI>Wish</HI> will signify nothing; 'Tis to no purpose to Propound it. We read, Eccl. I. 15. <HI>That which is Croo∣ked cannot be made Straight; and that which is wanting cannot be Numbred.</HI> There are <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> which the <HI>Decree</HI> of God has assign'd for us, and <HI>Sorrows</HI> which <HI>He distributes in His Anger:</HI> A <HI>Decree</HI> which can∣not be Revoked, cannot be Resi∣sted;
<PB N="23" REF="001691_0022_0FB52A4C95EF14F0"/>there is no contending with it. Who can pretend unto the <HI>Num∣bring</HI> of them?</P>
<P>First. We may have our <HI>Bodily</HI> Infirmities, which may be <HI>Grievous Diseases.</HI> But can they not be <HI>Cured?</HI> No; There comes that Message unto us from Heaven concerning them, <HI>Thou shalt use many Medicines, and thou shalt not be Cured.</HI> We must lye under the <HI>Grief,</HI> as long as we are <HI>in the Body. Old Age</HI> will be full of such <HI>Ails. Multa Senem—.</HI> Rarely can the <HI>Old Man</HI> say as he, <HI>I find nothing amiss, which Old Age may be accused of.</HI> Ah, Dim-sighted Old Man, whose trembling Hands lean on the Staff, whose Appetite flags, and whose Memory fails; There is no <HI>Curing</HI> of <HI>Threescore Years and Ten!</HI></P>
<P>Again; <HI>Grievous Accidents</HI> may come upon us. But they were <HI>Un∣foreseen.</HI> We could not by any <HI>Fore∣sight</HI> or <HI>Caution,</HI> or <HI>Parry,</HI> keep them off. And they are <HI>come,</HI> they con∣not be <HI>Cured.</HI> The <HI>Grief</HI> will abide;
<PB N="24" REF="001691_0023_0FB52A50577737A8"/>the <HI>Wormwood</HI> and the <HI>Gall,</HI> be al∣ways had in <HI>Remembrance</HI> with us.</P>
<P>Moreover, We may be plung'd into <HI>Wants</HI> and <HI>Straits</HI> that will be <HI>Grievous</HI> to us. But such as we can∣not get <HI>Reliev'd;</HI> We can see no way of <HI>Relief.</HI> The <HI>Grief</HI> is never like to cease as long as we live. We are <HI>staked down</HI> in the midst of <HI>Difficulties:</HI> There is no getting from them.</P>
<P>There must be something out of Joint in our <HI>Families;</HI> and it cannot be <HI>Cured;</HI> There will be no bring∣ing of the Thing to Rights.— I find these <HI>Incurable Griefs</HI> to grow upon my Meditations, and crowd and press in at such a rate, as to spoil my Method. I can't <HI>Speak</HI> of them, as fast as I <HI>Think.</HI> But they are <HI>Immethodical Things;</HI> they cause <HI>Confusion</HI> where they come; and it will be no Indecency to go on with a <HI>Tumultuary Enumeration</HI> of them. I say then; There are <HI>Maladies</HI> which are, <HI>Opprobria Medicorum;</HI> such as Despise and Disgrace the Skill
<PB N="25" REF="001691_0024_0FB52A51D68997A0"/>of our Physicians. And there are <HI>Miseries</HI> which are, <HI>Opprobria Ami∣corum;</HI> such that our Friends are <HI>Physicians of no Value</HI> in them. Yea, perhaps our <HI>Friends</HI> themselves may be such <HI>Miseries</HI> unto us: <HI>Crooked Things, that cannot be made Straight:</HI> We cannot <HI>Mend</HI> them; And yet we cannot <HI>Leave</HI> them. <HI>Uncomfort∣able</HI> Relatives, and yet <HI>Unescapable</HI> Relatives. A <HI>Grief;</HI> it may be, A <HI>Continual Dropping.</HI> But it cannot be <HI>Cured;</HI> It will stick by thee, as fast as a <HI>Rib</HI> in thy side; as long as thy <HI>Head</HI> upon thy Shoulders. O <HI>Prisoner of no Hope;</HI> There is no getting away; No Out-gate can be hoped for.</P>
<P>Shall I go on? There may <HI>Vi∣pers</HI> fasten upon us, which <HI>cannot be shaken off.</HI> The Servant of God once Complained of, a, <HI>Thorn in the Flesh.</HI> A Wicked, Venemous, Reproach∣ful <HI>Adversary,</HI> is by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> call'd, <HI>A Vexing Thorn.</HI> I suppose, our Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Com∣plaint was of such a <HI>Vexing Thorn.</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001691_0025_0FB52A5355E73D20"/>It was, <HI>A Messenger of Satan to Buffet him.</HI> He would fain have been de∣livered. He <HI>besought the Lord</HI> with one Day of Prayer after another, more than Once or Twice, for Deliverance. But it must not be granted him. The Answer was, 2 Cor. XII. 9. <HI>My Grace is sufficient for thee.</HI>
<Q>Be satisfied with what my Grace has done for thee on other Accounts; This Trial must continue all thy Days; Tis e∣nough that I will enable thee to bear the Trial.</Q></P>
<P>My Friends; There may be <HI>strong Chains</HI> laid upon us: And such may be our <HI>Madness,</HI> that Heaven will not allow the <HI>Chains</HI> to be taken off: 'Twill be a <HI>Madness</HI> to think of having them taken off.</P>
<P>I perceive, my <HI>Catalogue of In∣curables,</HI> is not yet finished. You were told, They <HI>cannot be Numbred. Public Affairs,</HI> and <HI>Public Stations,</HI> will make a vast Addition to the <HI>Number</HI> of them. In <HI>Public Affairs,</HI> 'tis how <HI>Grievous?</HI> — to see the
<PB N="27" REF="001691_0026_0FB52A54D875A478"/>Horrid <HI>Oppressions,</HI> the Cursed <HI>Bri∣beries,</HI> the Villianous <HI>Treacheries,</HI> and the Notorious <HI>Mismanagements,</HI> that Plague the Nations. That which makes the <HI>Grief</HI> become a <HI>desperate Sorrow,</HI> is, The Things are to be <HI>Cured</HI> by no <HI>Remonstrances.</HI> They may <HI>Lift up their Voice,</HI> if they please. There may be much <HI>Roaring</HI> at it: No <HI>Curing</HI> of it. No <HI>Cure,</HI> till He come, who is <HI>Mightier than many Waters.</HI> In <HI>Public Stations,</HI> 'tis <HI>Griev∣ous</HI> to Encounter the <HI>Misconstructi∣on,</HI> and the <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> which all that are in any Service must meet withal. O you Servants of <HI>Many, Heavy Loads</HI> must be laid upon you; and under your Loads you shall be <HI>Basely dealt</HI> withal. But I'll tell you for your Comfort, There is no <HI>Help</HI> for it; no <HI>Cure</HI> to be had; you must get along as well as you can; To have it any better, is a <HI>Thing to be despaired of.</HI></P>
<P>There is this Advice, you might be sure would be left with you, be∣fore we go any further. Beware
<PB N="28" REF="001691_0027_0FB52A56560BB510"/>of taking any <HI>Indirect Ways</HI> to get off the <HI>Annoyances</HI> that cleave so close unto you. We must <HI>bear our Grief,</HI> as long as we cannot <HI>Honest∣ly</HI> get from under it. Sometimes, if we will <HI>Sin</HI> for it, we may by some <HI>Sin</HI> free our selves from these and those <HI>Grievous Things.</HI> That is to say, <HI>God</HI> has laid on the <HI>Grief,</HI> and the <HI>Divel</HI> offers, that if you'l accept his Help, he'l take it off. But, surely, <HI>The Remedy is worse than the Disease.</HI> Oh! Reject the <HI>Divels Offers.</HI> Never do any <HI>Sinful</HI> Thing to be made <HI>Easy</HI> by it. Say; <HI>'Tu my Grief, and I will not speak any thing that is wrong to have it asswa∣ged; I will forbear doing any thing amiss to have it eased. It shall be as it is, until God will put me into a way to be set at Liberty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. But now, the CASE is, <HI>How to bear these Grievous Things?</HI></P>
<P>What tho' the <HI>Griefs</HI> cannot be <HI>Cured?</HI> Thanks be to our good God; They are not <HI>Intolerable,</HI> tho'
<PB N="29" REF="001691_0028_0FB52A58961872C8"/>they be <HI>Incurable.</HI> The Direction to be given in a more Summary way is this.</P>
<P>The <HI>Griefs</HI> that can't be <HI>Cured,</HI> must be <HI>born,</HI> as God shall <HI>Enable</HI> us, and as God has <HI>Directed</HI> us. 'Tis not enough to say, <HI>What can't be Cur'd must be Endur'd.</HI> The CASE is, <HI>How they shall be Endured?</HI> The only <HI>Cure</HI> for many of our <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> is to <HI>Bear</HI> them Decently, to <HI>Bear</HI> them Discreetly. <HI>Hearken to me, my beloved Brethren;</HI> A very considerable Part of what we have to do in the World, is to <HI>Bear</HI> suit∣ably the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> of the World. The <HI>Bigger,</HI> and you will excuse me if I say, the <HI>Harder</HI> part of our Work, lies in our <HI>Passive Obe∣dience. Common Sense</HI> taught the very <HI>Pagans</HI> to say, <HI>Levius fit Patientia, Quicquid corrigere est nefas.</HI> What no body can tell how to <HI>Cure,</HI> may by <HI>Patience</HI> be <HI>Asswaged</HI> and <HI>Eased</HI> wonderfully. Surely, <HI>special Grace</HI> will teach us <HI>more than the Beasts of the Earth.</HI> 'Tis our best <HI>Prudence</HI> to
<PB N="30" REF="001691_0029_0FB52A5A15F14B58"/>bear our <HI>Grievous Things</HI> with our best <HI>Patience;</HI> To carry our <HI>Bur∣dens</HI> handsomely.</P>
<P>A due <HI>Patience</HI> under <HI>Grievous Things;</HI> I beseech you to consider it; This <HI>Patience</HI> does exceedingly <HI>Glorify God.</HI> No Devotion does more <HI>Glorify God.</HI> God sees our <HI>Pa∣tience.</HI> The Glorious God is exceed∣ingly Gratified with it. No Lan∣guage, no, none, makes a more grateful Melody in the Ears of Heaven, than this; <HI>O my God, such a Grief is by thee order'd for me; and because thou hast order'd it, I Patiently, Willingly, Cheerfully submit unto it.</HI> By this Lovely <HI>Submission</HI> to our <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> Oh! the <HI>Glory</HI> that we give unto our God, and our Sa∣viour. So did our Saviour <HI>Glorify</HI> His Father. 'Tis an <HI>High flight</HI> in our Conformity to our Saviour, when we come to that Language; <HI>The Cup which my Heavenly Father gives me to Drink of, shall not I Drink of it? Oh! 'Tis all well, that such a Father does!</HI> Our Saviour, who bore
<PB N="31" REF="001691_0030_0FB52A5DD76D3910"/>the <HI>Cross,</HI> will have every Christian to be a <HI>Cross-bearer.</HI> There can be nothing more Pleasing unto our Saviour, than to see a <HI>Disciple</HI> take his <HI>Cross,</HI> and bear the <HI>Cross</HI> as it becomes a <HI>Disciple.</HI> We also read, 1 Cor. IV. 9 <HI>We are made a Specta∣cle unto Angels.</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> of God, they are the <HI>Spectators</HI> of all the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> that are laid upon us: They are <HI>Spectators</HI> of our <HI>Car∣riage</HI> under them Carry well, O Suffering Child of God; The <HI>Mor∣ning-Stars</HI> will <HI>sing together,</HI> the <HI>Sons of God</HI> will <HI>shout for Joy,</HI> at the <HI>Spe∣ctacle.</HI> The <HI>Grace</HI> of God working under thy <HI>Grief,</HI> will appear Ami∣able and Admirable, to those Noble <HI>Spectators.</HI> And thou that art now the <HI>Occasion</HI> of their <HI>Praises,</HI> wilt one Day be the <HI>Companion</HI> of them. And by our <HI>Patience</HI> under <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> we are Gloriously prepar∣ing for <HI>Glorious Things.</HI> Like our Blessed <HI>Fore-runner,</HI> we must <HI>first Suffer</HI> and then <HI>enter into Glory.</HI> By a right Behaviour under the <HI>Suffer∣ings
<PB N="32" REF="001691_0031_0FB52A5F56689668"/>of this present Time;</HI> we make ready for the <HI>Glory that is to be Re∣vealed.</HI> It is in this <HI>Preparation</HI> work∣ing us up for it, that as we read, 2 Cor. IV. 17. <HI>Our light Afflictions here, which are but for a Moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</HI> Briefly, <HI>There is no Remedy but Patience.</HI> Then <HI>Pa∣tience,</HI> thou shalt be the <HI>Remedy.</HI></P>
<P>The CASE is yet waiting; <HI>How must we bear our Grievous Things?</HI></P>
<P>First; You have been already told, <HI>You must bear your Griefs,</HI> AS GOD SHALL ENABLE YOU. This implies, That they must be born <HI>Prayerfully.</HI> The first Thing you are to do, is to confess, <HI>That you can bear Nothing.</HI> But then, in an Humble Sense of your own In∣ability to <HI>bear</HI> the least Thing in the World, fly to God, cry to God, ask for the Help of God Hope to <HI>Bear,</HI> as well as to <HI>Do,</HI> all Things, according to the Motto of Christi∣anity, THRO' CHRIST, WHO STRENGTHENS ME. It was a
<PB N="33" REF="001691_0032_0FB52A61AB0BCE50"/>most proper Counsil; Jam. V. 13. <HI>Is there any among you Afflicted? Let him Pray.</HI> When <HI>Grievous Things</HI> are laid upon you, receive them, as the <HI>Camels</HI> do their <HI>Burdens;</HI> re∣ceive them on your Knees: Fall to <HI>Praying</HI> immediately. But more than so, <HI>Carry</HI> them in this Posture too, as long as they must lye upon you. Your <HI>Prayers</HI> under all your <HI>Griefs!</HI> Your <HI>Prayers:</HI> To call for these, verily, 'tis not the least Er∣rand of your <HI>Griefs:</HI> This is the Message they come upon. <HI>Oh! pour out thy Prayer unto God, now His Chastning is upon thee.</HI> Now this is to be one very Repeted Stroke of your <HI>Prayers; Lord, help me to bear my Grief: To bear it Suitably. O my God, Let me not by any unsuitable Be∣haviour Dishonour Thee, under the Grievous Things which thou dost Order for me!</HI> My Fellow-sufferers, I will now speak a <HI>Good Word,</HI> which may make your <HI>Heart Glad,</HI> when <HI>stouping with Heaviness.</HI> 'Tis this; A Sollicitude about this thing, To
<PB N="34" REF="001691_0033_0FB52A63D6081360"/>obtain Help from our God, that we may not Sin under our Grief; 'Tis a lovely Token of a <HI>Soul bound up in the Bundle of Life:</HI> A lovely Token of an <HI>Heart sound in the Sta∣tutes of God.</HI> It is a <HI>Token of Salva∣tion;</HI> And such a <HI>Token,</HI> that it is well worth meeting with some <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> to have such a Dis∣covery of it.</P>
<P>It will be no Contradiction, to go on, and say;</P>
<P>Secondly. They must be born <HI>Silently</HI> too. Under all your <HI>Griev∣ous Things</HI> you must keep up that Frame, Psal. XXXIX. 9. <HI>I was Dumb, I opened not my Mouth, because thou didst it.</HI> No Murmuring, I be∣seech you. <HI>In a certain Place</HI> of the Psalms, there is a Passage, which may be so Translated, <HI>Silence is Praise to thee, O God.</HI> We never Praise our Glorious God so well, as by <HI>Silence</HI> under the <HI>Grievous Things</HI> that He lays upon us. Our Murmurs are to be <HI>silenced</HI> by the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God. <HI>O thou Afflicted,</HI> Whatever
<PB N="35" REF="001691_0034_0FB52A6556AECB10"/>be thy <HI>Grief,</HI> lye at the Foot of the <HI>Sovereign</HI> GOD, and think; <HI>Lord, Here I lye before thee, as the Clay be∣fore the Potter. Shall the Clay Complain of any Grievous Things done unto it? Lord, If thou break me to pieces, I can∣not Complain of being hardly dealt withal.</HI> And by the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of God, our <HI>Murmurs</HI> are to be yet further <HI>silenced. O thou Afflicted,</HI> A∣dore a <HI>Righteous God,</HI> and think, <HI>Why should a Living Man Complain; a Man for the Punishment of his Sin? In the most Grievous Things that are done unto me, Lord, Thou doest Punish me less than my Iniquities deserve; To be broken sore in the place of Dragons is no more than I deserve.</HI> But is this all that we have to <HI>Silence</HI> our <HI>Mur∣murs?</HI> No; There is a <HI>Faithful Sa∣viour,</HI> who does manage all. O Be∣liever, Thou hast also this <HI>Consola∣tion</HI> to <HI>delight thy Soul,</HI> in the <HI>Mul∣titude of Thoughts</HI> which thy <HI>Griev∣ous Things</HI> do fill thee withal. <HI>O my dear Saviour, whose Name is, The Lord my Helper; Thou art He, by
<PB N="36" REF="001691_0035_0FB52A6795F0D628"/>whom all my Grievous Things are dis∣pensed unto me; And I am sure, Thou hast meant all unto Good; Tho' what thou doest, I know not now, I shall know hereafter. In the mean time, I know, that thou wilt not lay more upon me, than thou wilt make me able to Con∣flict withal.</HI> Oh! Let no <HI>unbecoming Expression</HI> be heard from you. Such Thoughts as these must Restrain your <HI>Passions.</HI> You must not be <HI>Pas∣sionate,</HI> Outrageous, Tempestuous under your <HI>Grievous Things:</HI> Not be always, or often <HI>upon the Fret;</HI> Not give way to <HI>Discomposures.</HI> When you are in a <HI>Storm</HI> at any time, Oh! Rebuke it into a <HI>Calm,</HI> with such Thoughts as these; <HI>Why art thou cast down, O my Soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Fear God and be Quiet. It is God, who in every Grievous Thing, does but per∣form the Thing that is appointed for thee!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>Humbly,</HI> but yet <HI>Stoutly.</HI> They must be born <HI>Manfully:</HI> With the Vigour of <HI>Manly Christianity.</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="001691_0036_0FB52A6915D62238"/>Under <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> don't for∣get that Word, <HI>If thou Faint in the Day of Adversity, thy Strength is but small.</HI> There is Hazard, lest <HI>Griev∣ous Things</HI> befalling you, O <HI>Diligent seekers of God,</HI> may discourage your <HI>Diligence.</HI> But, Oh! Don't give way to any Discouragement. <HI>Be not wearied, nor Faint in your Minds!</HI> Most Laudable the Cou∣rage of the Godly Man; Job XIII. 15. <HI>Tho He stay me, yet will I trust in Him.</HI> Thus; Tho' you should have the <HI>Grief</HI> of being among the <HI>Poor of this World,</HI> yet Resolve, <HI>I will be as Rich towards God, as ever I can.</HI> Tho' you should have the <HI>Grief</HI> of a <HI>Name</HI> overwhelmed with <HI>Reproaches,</HI> yet Resolve, <HI>I will Ho∣nour the Name of my great Redeemer, as much as ever I can.</HI> Tho' you should have the <HI>Grief</HI> of Languish∣ments under Weaknesses, yet Re∣solve, <HI>My God, I will yet Love thee with all my Strength.</HI> Yea, Tho' you cry unto God, and He does not hear you; A Thing, how <HI>Grievous,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="001691_0037_0FB52A6B856F1D00"/>how <HI>Grievous?</HI> — Yet Resolve, <HI>Lord, I will continue my Cries unto thee; I will call upon thee as long as I live!</HI> Oh! Don't harbour the least Thought of Deserting the Service of God, tho' you should meet with never such <HI>Grievous Things</HI> in ser∣ving of Him, and have never such <HI>Darkness in your Pathes.</HI> Bear all with Resolution. O Resolved Ser∣vant of God, say; <HI>Lord, Tho' all this come upon me, yet I will not forget thee, nor deal falsely in thy Cove∣nant!</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. They must be born <HI>Fruitfully.</HI> Your <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> you must bear them <HI>so well,</HI> as to be the <HI>Better</HI> for them. So bear your <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> as to make them <HI>Useful Things.</HI> You can't <HI>get rid</HI> of your <HI>Griefs,</HI> then <HI>get Good</HI> by your <HI>Griefs.</HI> Press after that Attainment; Psal. CXIX. 71. <HI>It is good for me, that I have been Afflicted.</HI></P>
<P>It is Observable, That for the most part, the <HI>Grief</HI> which People would be most fond of having <HI>Re∣moved,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="001691_0038_0FB52A6CD62E8338"/>proves the most <HI>Abiding</HI> one, the most <HI>Confirmed</HI> one. The <HI>Griev∣ous Thing</HI> which is, the <HI>Grand Ulcer</HI> of their Minds, the <HI>Grand Vexer</HI> of their Hearts, the <HI>Grand Imbitter∣ment</HI> of their Lives; This <HI>Grievous Thing</HI> must prove a <HI>Lasting</HI> one. I will tell you the Reason; O <HI>grieved</HI> one, Thou hast not yet got so much Good by thy <HI>Grief,</HI> as ought to be The <HI>End</HI> of thy <HI>Grief</HI> is not yet gain'd, and therefore it must not yet come to an <HI>End.</HI> Syrs; Let nor your <HI>Griefs</HI> prove as <HI>Unprofitable</HI> as they are <HI>Incurable.</HI> You can't <HI>shake off</HI> your Troubles; But if your Troubles <HI>all Work together for your Good,</HI> This will be more to your Advantage, than if they were <HI>sha∣ken of.</HI> Oh! 'Tis a Lamentable Thing, to see a Man <HI>tied fast</HI> unto what is <HI>Grievous</HI> to him; and yet this Man, as Foolish, and as Car∣nal, and as Graceless a Wretch, as if he were under no Chastisement from God. The sight is a very <HI>Grievous</HI> one, but yet a very <HI>Fre∣quent</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="001691_0039_0FB52A6F17465FC0"/>one; <HI>People in Griefs, and not at all improving in Piety under their Griefs.</HI> How Reproveable, but how Pitiable, that Obstinacy; Jer. XI. 30. <HI>In vain have I smitten them; they have received no Correction.</HI></P>
<P>My Friends, Your <HI>Griefs</HI> can't be <HI>Cured.</HI> But cannot you then be <HI>Cured</HI> by your <HI>Griefs?</HI> Oh! May it come to this; Isa. XXVII. 9. <HI>Ini∣quity shall hereby be purged, and all the Fruit shall be to take away Sin.</HI> Your <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> Let them <HI>Cure</HI> you of your <HI>Mistakes; Cure</HI> you of your <HI>Vices; Cure</HI> you of your <HI>Follies.</HI> Be not <HI>Fools bray'd in a Mortar.</HI> Let your <HI>Grievous Things</HI> bring you to <HI>Repent</HI> of those <HI>Evil Things</HI> which you have most of all Cause to be <HI>grieved</HI> for. Let your <HI>Grievous Things</HI> prevent your wandring in those <HI>Ways</HI> which are <HI>always Grievous,</HI> &amp; Reclaim you to a serious Enquiry into the <HI>Cause</HI> of your <HI>Evil Things,</HI> or wherefore <HI>God is thus contending</HI> with you. Let your <HI>Grievous Things</HI> cause you to grow in that Acquain∣tance
<PB N="41" REF="001691_0040_0FB52A7097726548"/>with Christ, that Commu∣nion with God, that <HI>Meetness for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</HI> and all that Good, which may make amends for all the Evil you meet withal.</P>
<P>Will you pemit me now, to sin∣gle out Three or Four very <HI>usual Cases</HI> in the Neighbourhood; <HI>Griefs</HI> that are very <HI>usual</HI> in the Neigh∣bourhood. The Neighbours <HI>have</HI> them; and they can't <HI>Cure</HI> them; they must <HI>bear</HI> them: <HI>If they speak,</HI> their <HI>Grief would not be asswaged; if they forbear,</HI> they <HI>will not be eased.</HI> My Neighbours, I will tell you, how to <HI>bear</HI> them, and find Cause to Bless God, that he has call'd you to <HI>bear</HI> them.</P>
<P>First. There are <HI>Corporal</HI> Indis∣positions, wherewith many are in∣commoded; and such as are not <HI>Curable</HI> ones. They are Indisposi∣tions that will <HI>stick</HI> by you: If they don't <HI>shorten</HI> your Lives, yet they
<PB N="42" REF="001691_0041_0FB52A7216A70E98"/><HI>sower</HI> your Lives; and they will be on you <HI>as long as you live. Blind∣ness, Deafness, Lameness,</HI> the <HI>Tongue of the Stammerer,</HI> or some <HI>Deformity;</HI> perhaps a <HI>Pain,</HI> or a <HI>Sore,</HI> beyond the Help of those, whose Profession it is, to <HI>Cure</HI> what they can. You must say, <HI>This is a Grief, and I must bear it!</HI> But, how will you <HI>bear</HI> it? Why, if you can't have your <HI>Na∣tural Disorders</HI> taken away, I pray, Get your <HI>Spiritual Disorders</HI> taken away. This may be done. Get a <HI>Soul Cured</HI> of all Sinful Distempers. The <HI>Grief</HI> of a <HI>Soul out of Order,</HI> this is a <HI>Grief</HI> that should not be born. And, Oh! ply the Throne of Grace; Do it with Supplicati∣ons, for contrary <HI>Effects of Grace,</HI> which may weigh against all the <HI>Defects of Nature.</HI> Ask, <HI>Lord, Give me Eyes to see Invisible Things!</HI> Ask, <HI>Lord, Open the Ears of my Soul to thy Discipline!</HI> Ask, <HI>Lord, Help me to walk Uprightly!</HI> Ask, <HI>Lord, Let me take heed, that I do not Sin with my Tongue!</HI> Ask, <HI>Lord, make me all Glo∣rious
<PB N="43" REF="001691_0042_0FB52A7396A60110"/>within!</HI> Ask, <HI>Lord Heal my Soul, for I have sinned against thee!</HI> These are Points that may be come at. Come at these, O you that are <HI>bowed down,</HI> And you have an A∣bundant Compensation for all that bows you down.</P>
<P>I will add; The <HI>Female-Sex</HI> is become subject unto several Cir∣cumstances, that, no doubt, are <HI>Grievous</HI> ones. There are <HI>unavoid∣able Sorrows,</HI> which the <HI>Third Chap∣ter of Genesis</HI> has confin'd them to. What will you do, <HI>O Handmaids of the Lord,</HI> but make the <HI>Yoke</HI> as ea∣sy as you can, by <HI>well-bearing</HI> of it; and look up to a dear Saviour, who has ways to turn <HI>Curses</HI> into <HI>Blessings! Many such things are with him!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There are <HI>Impoverish∣ments,</HI> which many do undergo, and must undergo; there can be no <HI>Curing</HI> of them. You must be <HI>Low</HI> in the World; you can't get clear of the Things that will keep you <HI>Low.</HI> There are many Things;
<PB N="44" REF="001691_0043_0FB52A7515D01F28"/>you could be glad if you had them. You are distressed by the want of them. Yet you can't have them. <HI>Want is like to be your Master.</HI> You may say, <HI>This is a Grief, and I must bear it!</HI> But, how will you <HI>bear</HI> it? Become <HI>Rich in Faith.</HI> You can't make sure of <HI>Temporal Riches;</HI> You may make sure of <HI>Eternal Riches.</HI> Oh! Hearken to me; There is not the poorest Man in this great Con∣gregation, but what may before Night become an Owner of <HI>Un∣searchable Riches. Man,</HI> Embrace thy tendered Saviour, and all the <HI>Un∣searchable Riches of Christ</HI> are made over to thee. And why should it not also be said, <HI>Honour the Lord with your Substance,</HI> tho' you have but a <HI>little Substance.</HI> Do what you <HI>can,</HI> when you can't do what you <HI>would.</HI> The <HI>Two Mites;</HI> These will be of great Account with God.</P>
<P>Thirdly. There are some, who have their <HI>Adversaries;</HI> People are disaffected unto them: The <HI>Dis∣affection</HI> is <HI>Invaterate.</HI> It had perhaps
<PB N="45" REF="001691_0044_0FB52A7695DB42B8"/><HI>little Cause;</HI> and it will have no <HI>Cure.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Rooted</HI> Aversion. It will not listen to the Voice of any <HI>Char∣mer.</HI> They will say, <HI>This is a Grief, and I must bear it!</HI> But, how will you <HI>bear</HI> it? Why, with incomparable <HI>Meekness;</HI> With the utmost Abhor∣rence of all <HI>Personal Revenge;</HI> with Generous and Exquisite Projecti∣ons, <HI>How to overcome Evil with Good?</HI> But this is not all. <HI>Mend your Pace,</HI> for Allatrations: as the <HI>Reine Deer,</HI> for the <HI>Dog</HI> in the <HI>Sled:</HI> Let your <HI>Pace</HI> in doing all the Good that is possible, be quickened by the Noise of your Enemies, as much as 'tis possible. And keep an exact Guard upon all your <HI>Steps,</HI> to keep in <HI>plain Pathes,</HI> because of your <HI>Observers.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly. Many see <HI>Grievous Things</HI> in their <HI>Domestic Circumstances.</HI> There are those, whose <HI>Relatives</HI> bring to them, the <HI>Griefs</HI> that cannot be <HI>Cu∣red.</HI> Some have been bereaved of <HI>Relatives,</HI> that were the <HI>Desire of their Eyes.</HI> The <HI>Death</HI> of such, has made a <HI>Breach</HI> upon them, which
<PB N="46" REF="001691_0045_0FB52A78EB9A6A20"/>perhaps <HI>cannot be healed.</HI> They may say, <HI>This is a Grief, and I must bear it!</HI> But, how will you <HI>bear</HI> it? <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thine Eyes from Tears;</HI> Thy <HI>Resignation</HI> shall be <HI>Re∣warded.</HI> The <HI>Tears</HI> will not fetch them to Life again. But now those are gone, that can't be fetch'd back, lay the <HI>faster Hold</HI> on a Glorious CHRIST; Converse more with <HI>Him</HI> than heretofore. <HI>The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul! and He shall be more to me than all that is taken from me!</HI> Others there may be, who have their Hearts broken with <HI>Un∣desirable Relatives: Foolish</HI> ones; <HI>Fro∣ward</HI> ones; <HI>Wicked</HI> ones; Churlish and Wretched <HI>Consorts; Children</HI> which take to bad Courses; <HI>Bro∣thers</HI> or <HI>Sisters</HI> that are strangely Abusive: Those of whom it may be said, They are <HI>a Grief of Mind unto them;</HI> They are an <HI>Heaviness unto them.</HI> They may say, <HI>This is a Grief, and I must bear it!</HI> But, how will you <HI>bear</HI> it? You can't <HI>Change</HI> the <HI>Untoward Things:</HI> You can't
<PB N="47" REF="001691_0046_0FB52A7A55D5D418"/>give <HI>New Hearts,</HI> or <HI>Kind Hearts</HI> un∣to them. However, Two Things you may do. You may <HI>do This;</HI> You may carry it well to <HI>them,</HI> tho' they don't carry it well to <HI>you.</HI> You may do <HI>your Duty,</HI> tho' they do not <HI>theirs.</HI> An admirable way to <HI>Conquer</HI> them. How Happy are you, if God prosper you, and in this way give you a <HI>Conquest</HI> over them? Again; You may <HI>do This.</HI> When you can do nothing else for them, you can <HI>Pray</HI> for them. When there is nothing else to be done for them, still they are to be <HI>Prayed for.</HI> Be they never so <HI>Vicious,</HI> or never so <HI>Absurd,</HI> you may go alone, and Weep unto the Lord for them, and beg of Him, to <HI>Convert them from the Error of their way.</HI> It may be, The Almighty Hearer of Pray∣ers, will anon say unto you, <HI>Con∣cerning this poor Creature, I have heard thee; and thou shalt yet have some Comfort in what I shall do upon thy Supplications!</HI></P>

Our Dear People, We Preach many Sermons to make you <HI>Holy;</HI> I have now Preached one to make you <HI>Easy.</HI> Perhaps, it would be thrown into the List of <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> if by extending it unto any further <HI>Length,</HI> it should go so far as to be <HI>Tedious.</HI> In <HI>this</HI> also I will make you <HI>Easy;</HI> and here break off with saying, <HI>Hold out, O Patience, Hold out under all thy Grievous Things; It will be but a very little while; And Heaven will make Amends for all!</HI></P>
