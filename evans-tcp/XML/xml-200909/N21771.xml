<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SAGE old Solomon very wisely re∣marked that there is <HI>a time for all things;</HI> and notwithstanding his au∣thority many will admit there should be a time for <HI>merriment.</HI> In this va∣luable book, which is the very <HI>essence</HI> and <HI>quintessence</HI> of all mirth and jovi∣ality, you will find much genuine wit, but nothing that can have a prejudicial influence upon your mind. It mat∣ters little who you are, whether old or young, snarling or good-natured, pretty or ugly, crooked or straight, dimple-chined or copper-nosed, a tin∣ker or a nabob; whoever you are it will most assuredly excite your laugh∣ter. For if your lips are even made of foal-leather, if your eyes flash the vengeance of Diogenes who lived in a tub, yet the paroxisms of giggling will seize you as unawares as a bum-bai∣liff; and if your ribs are not made out
<PB N="iv" REF="028656_0004_0FDA3D2FD5088198"/>of crow-bars you must certainly put them a little in motion.</P>
<P>Why should you be resolved to be hipp'd or in the dumps? Why should you proclaim war against yourself and tear your wig or gouge out your eyes in a fit of desperation, least you should freeze or starve to death in this world? If you are in such a mopish habit you will here find a most powerful anti∣dote to chase away the fumes of me∣lancholy. Then, if you are sad do not suffer misfortune to thrust her pitchforks of despair into you, for, as the song says, as light heart and a thin pair of breeches will carry us through the world, brave boys.</P>
<P>As for the languishing nymph, who is up to her eye brows in love, and the deep sighing swain whose heart is as full of holes as a riddle, they ought (for humanity's sake) to be prevented from slabbering and snivelling at their hard fate. Not an hundred apothe∣caries shops, not a regiment of phy∣sicians,
<PB N="v" REF="028656_0005_0FDA3CFA3756EA78"/>inclusive of quack doctors in abundance, will do them half the ser∣vice that can be effected by a perusal of this book. If they should chance to be a little squeamish at the stomach, it will prove an excellent remedy for the spleen, or the belly-ach of despair. In a word, the Editor has written and compiled it for the benefit of those who may be disposed to dance and sing; to add glee to the short pittance of life, to improve the social virtues; to heighten the charms of the big-bel∣lied decanter, and to frighten haggard care and her wry faced train to a dis∣tance. Depend upon it, Reader, that with a few glasses of wine in your head, a pretty lass upon your knee and the <HI>"Feast of Merriment"</HI> in your hand, you will be a thousand times happier than any monarch in the universe.</P>

<HEAD>THE FEAST OF MERRIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A SCOTCH major, who had been so skillful with his sword as to fight several duels with re∣peated success, but who, on account of his extreme desire for quarreling when a little intoxicated, and for his boasted courage, was deserted and de∣spised by his brother officers, came one evening into a large company. There happened to be present a Yankee, an officer of the same regiment which was then stationed at Montreal. This Yankee related among other things the failure of a certain expedition in which he had the misfor∣tune to be wounded. That was because you were a <HI>rascally set of cowards,</HI> observed the su∣percilious major. You are a <HI>d—n'd liar,</HI> says the Yankee. The company stared. The Scotchman looked down upon him with as much contempt as Goliah did upon David and immediately asked, Are you a man to meet me? Yes, replied the Yankee, at any time and where you please, only with this proviso, that we me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> without seconds. Well then, to-morrow morning at five o'clock, at —. Agreed. The company present en∣deavored to dissuade the Yankee, telling him the major had every advantage where he had none, and that he had best compromise matters, ere he would have cause to repent his rashness; but he still persisted. The next morning the Yankee
<PB N="8" REF="028656_0007_0FDA3D323856E9A0"/>repaired to the place somewhat before the ap∣pointed hour, armed with a <HI>large musket,</HI> shortly after the major made his appearance, with his brace of pistols and his sword. Before he had ad∣vanced far, the Yankee, in an austere tone, bid him halt or he would blow his brains out. Upon which the major, struck with amazement at this unexpected stratagem, reluctantly obeyed, but ex∣postulated with him upon the injustice of such an ungentle man like proceeding; the Yankee was implacable, determined to punish him for his past conduct and for the abuse he had himself receiv∣ed. Lay down your sword and pistols, says he, (still presenting his musket) and <HI>to the right, about, face, march!</HI> The poor major was again under the necessity of obeying, and uttering a volley of curses against his stars, passively submitted.—The Yankee then quietly took possession of his arms. 'Tis base, 'tis cowardly thus to disarm me of all defence, says the major. No, replied his fellow combatant, I will deal honorably with you, there take my musket (throwing it towards him) and defend yourself. He, quite incensed, seized the weapon with a mixture of exultation and precipi∣tate vengeance, and rushing forward demanded his arms <HI>or he would blow him to h—l;</HI> blow and be d—n'd, says the Yankee. Provoked at such unparelled insolence, in a fit of frenzy, he drew the trigger! But, alas, the musket had <HI>not been charged!</HI> The glory of our braggadocia was so sullied, and his seeling so mortally wounded by this indignation, that he sold his commission and left the place.</P>

Mr. L—, a citizen of some note in New-York, was taken very ill of the gout, which in∣spired him with such dreadful apprehensions that he looked upon himself as already dead. Dr. M N— was sent for, and on entering the room his patient exclaimed. Oh, doctor, <HI>I'm a dead man, I'm a dead man!</HI> Well then, replied the doctor, I can do nothing for you, and instantly left the room. On his return some gentlemen enquired, how his patient was? How! why he is dead. Dead! said they, with the utmost sur∣prize. Yes, absolutely dead, replies the doctor. The solemn news soon gained circulation; howe∣ver before long it was discovered to be a false report. Some of the gentlemen to whom the doctor had communicated the intelligence meeting with him shortly afterwards, questioned him, why he had informed them that Mr L— was dead, when it was not so. What is he not dead? said he. No surely. Well then, said the doctor, <HI>he is ad—n'd liar for he told me so himself.</HI></P>
<P>A young man meeting his father one moon∣light evening pretty tipsey, thought it his duty to lead him home; on their way the old gentle∣man happened to stumble just as they were passing under a sign, and enquired of his son what sign it was? says he, It is a sign you are d—n'd drunk, father.</P>
<P>Two sailors passing by a taylor's shop in Phila∣delphia, observed one of the journeyman had a great variety of patches in the back part of his jacket; upon which one of the honest tars ex∣claimed,

<P>Previous to the late American revolution, when distinction and rank were more fashionable than at present, there happened to be a splendid ball in the city of New-York, which Miss T—and Miss M—attended. Miss T's father had been a rope-maker in the former part of his life, but having acquired an immense fortune at his trade, he quit business and lived in the most magnificent style. But the circumstances of Miss M—'s father, who was a saddler, were somewhat cir∣cumscribed, and he still subsisted by the use of his hammer and awl. Miss T—, who had con∣ceived an aversion against Miss M—, affected a surprizing mortification that the august person∣ages of the assembly should be insulted by the presence of a lady of such mean rank and fortune; in a fit of extreme indignation she came up to Miss M— and in a whisper said to her, Miss, I wish to speak to you before one of the mana∣gers. Miss M— consented, and when they came before the manager, Miss T— proclaimed in a loud voice, which instantly silenced the whole company, "Mr. Manager, I am astonished that you admit a person of her low rank (pointing to Miss M—) to disgrace the presence of her superiors, and at any rate I think if such creatures cannot be excluded, they ought to be compelled to wear the badges of their professions." "Alas, retorted Miss M—, with a smile of infinite con∣tempt, were we all to appear with the <HI>badges</HI> of
<PB N="11" REF="028656_0010_0FDA3D035BDD2208"/><HI>our professions,</HI> we should see your <HI>noble</HI> ladyship with a <HI>rope</HI> around your <HI>neck."</HI> This reply oc∣casioned such reiterated peals of laughter, that the noble Miss T— was obliged to retire with anguish and mortification not to be described.</P>
<P>A Dutch seaman being aloft unluckily fell from a great height flat upon deck, but not re∣ceiving any considerable injury, rose up and ex∣claimed, <HI>Got bless me, I've broke my bipe.</HI></P>
<P>Some time ago a number of taylors had a meet∣ing at an inn, one of them coming later than the rest enquired of a boy in the bar-room, whether there was any gentlemen met up stairs, was an∣swered, No, but there's a parcel of taylors up there.</P>
<P>Two lawyers, who were as different in stature as in ability, happened to be opponents in a cause. The one, though very diminutive, proved never∣theless too powerful in argument; which when his taller adversary discovered, and thinking to confuse him by redicule, bellowed out very austen∣tatious, Hold your prattle you little chatter-box, or I'll put you into my pocker. Could you do that, retorted the little orator, you would have more law in your <HI>pocket</HI> than ever you had in your <HI>head.</HI></P>
<P>One day a very little man was about entering a house, but the door being shut and the knocker placed above his reach, not wishing to hurt his knuckles, accosted a tall good-natured looking man just coming by and requested him to step up and knock for him, which when he had done he jo∣cosely
<PB N="12" REF="028656_0011_0FDA3D36A28B23C0"/>said, What are such little chaps as you good for? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he dw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri replied, for such big lubberly follows as you are to wait upon.</P>
<P>As a New-England sea-captain and an english∣man were conversing together, the latter says to the former, Do you know what we englishmen call you yankies? He was answered in the nega∣tive. Why, continued he, we call you pumpkins. Do you, says the yankee, and do you know what we call you englishman? No, truly. Why we call you squashes. Squashes, squashes, what are they? Pumpkins bastards, replied the yankee.</P>
<P>The celebrated Dr. Franklin sent word, one christmas morning to some of his literary friends that he intended to kill a turkey for their enter∣ainment by a discharge of one of his electrical batteries, and that the process of cooking might be carried on equally as philosophical, he intended to have it roasted by a fire kindled with the elec∣trical fluid. He began the business of charging his bottles, but before he had quite completed the process, by some casualty the whole battery was discharged through his own body. He was so vi∣olently stunned by this misfortune that he lay, a a considerable length of time, in stare of insensi∣bility. Shortly after the Doctor had recovered his senses, some of his friends coming into the room enquired what was the matter! Ah, gen∣tlemen, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plied he, I informed you of my inten∣tion to kill a turkey by electricity, but, alas, my design miscaried and I had like to have killed a <HI>goose.</HI></P>

A wild young nobleman being in company with Shakespear, desired leave to toast the d—l: with all my heart replies our wag, I have no ob∣jection to any of your lordship's <HI>friends.</HI></P>
<P>A gentleman being choaked with a honey∣comb, his friends began to bemoan him, Why make you such lamentation? said Shakespear, never man had a <HI>sweeter</HI> death.</P>
<P>Shakespear being at church, when a dry empty fellow preached, most of his auditors went out of the church, said, he made a very <HI>moving</HI> sermon.</P>
<P>Shakespear being with a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of merry compa∣nions, over a cheerful bowl, when different toa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s were going round, a gentleman, whose name was <HI>Brown,</HI> toasted a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> absent lady, which he had often done for many years, tho' he had never the con∣rage to speak to her: our wag, who sat next him, said, I believe, Sir, you have toasted that lady these seven years at least, and it's surprizing she is not <HI>Brown</HI> yet.</P>
<P>Shakespear being in company with some gen∣tlemen and ladies, who were playing at compari∣son; an agreeable young lady was likened to a repeater; she applied to Shakespear for the pro∣priety of the resemblance: Madam, says he, I find a very great difference; a repeater makes us <HI>remember</HI> the hours, but you make us <HI>forget</HI> them.</P>
<P>Shakespear having brought his friend down into his cellar, his friend observing there was no seat to sit upon, asked him the reason of it; be∣cause,
<PB N="14" REF="028656_0013_0FDA3D384A76C5A0"/>replied Shakespear, I will have no man that comes here drink <HI>any longer than he can stand.</HI></P>
<P>Shakespear being told by a gentleman, that players were idle fellows; you are mistaken says our wag, for their whole life is <HI>full of action.</HI></P>
<P>Shakespear went to a turner's shop to buy a <HI>mat;</HI> many were shewn him, but none pleased him. The turner thinking to play a trick upon him, called his wife and daughter, whose names were <HI>Mat;</HI> there, says the turner, are all the <HI>mats</HI> I have got; and there you may keep them, replied our wit, for I must have one that has not been <HI>tread</HI> upon.</P>
<P>Some ladies walking in the meadows, a few miles from London, they met a shepherd with a young kid in his arms, one of them stroked and admired it, and asked the reason it had no horns; the shepherd, vexed at being detained, answered, because <HI>he is not married.</HI></P>
<P>Lord M—endeavoring to persuade one of his dependants to marry his cast off mistress, said, she had been used a little; but if she had a good husband she might turn. Aye, but my lord, an∣swered the other, she has been so <HI>much used,</HI> that I am afraid she is not <HI>worth turning.</HI></P>
<P>A young lady who had been lately married, on seeing her husband about to rise pretty early in the morning, said, what, my dear, are you get∣ting up already? pray lie a little longer and rest yourself. No, my dear, I'll <HI>get up</HI> and <HI>rest</HI> myself.</P>

Shakespear one day condoling with an Irish gentleman, whose father had lately <HI>died well;</HI> says Paddy, it does not signify grieving, for its what we must all come to, if we do but <HI>live long enough.</HI></P>
<P>At a tavern meeting Shakespear finding him∣self intoxicated, slipped from the company and home to bed; next meeting one of the party, who reproached him with going away without taking leave of his companions; says he, indeed you ought to excuse me, for if I did not take leave of the company, <HI>I staid till I had entirely taken leave of myself.</HI></P>
<P>Lady L—asked Sir W—when he was Lord Mayor of London, how many women he had kissed since their marriage? Why, my lady, said Sir W—, if we had as many penny loaves as I have kissed women since you have been my wife, we should have bread enough to last us these seven years. And now, continues he, pray tell me how many gallants have kissed you in the same space of time? Why, if we had as many cheeses as I could tell you, I have had gallants, <HI>I think we should have three cheeses to every one of your loaves.</HI></P>
<P>Alderman Townsend one day seeing his soot∣man with an old greasy hat, slouching over his shoulders, Sirrah, says the alderman, who gave you that cuckold's hat? <HI>Indeed, Sir, says John, it was my mistress gave it me, and told me it was one of yours.</HI></P>
<P>Lord Temple asked a clergyman once, at the
<PB N="16" REF="028656_0015_0FDA3D399821F2B0"/>bottom of his table, why the goose, if there was one, was always placed next the parson? Really, said he, I can give no reason for it; but your question is so odd, that I shall never see a goose for the future <HI>without thinking of your lordship.</HI></P>
<P>The late duke of York asking a young lady, one day, what it was o'clock; she told him her watch <HI>stood.</HI> I don't wonder at that, madam, replied his highness, when it is so near <HI>your what-do-you-call-it.</HI></P>
<P>A gentleman and his man riding into the coun∣try, they met a fellow astride upon a cow: the man calls out to his master, Oh, Sir, says he, yonder is a strange sight; <HI>A fellow is on horseback upon a cow. That's a bull, said the gentleman. Nay, Sir, said the man, it is not a bull: I know it is a cow by its teats.</HI></P>
<P>One asked another why he wore his stockings the wrong side outwards; the other told him, <HI>Because there was a hole on the other side.</HI></P>
<P>A fellow that was notoriously known to have been in the late riots and insurrection, was brought before justice A—. Sirrah, says the justice, you shall be hanged if the law will do it; you are a notorious rogue: I remember you ever since the <HI>last resurrection.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. Wilson meeting his godson, asked him whither he was going? To school, replies the boy. That's well, said he, there is six-pence for you; follow thy learning apace; <HI>I may live to hear thee preach my funeral sermon.</HI></P>

Michael Angelo, in his picture of the last judg∣ment, in the pope's chapel at Rome, had painted a∣mong other figures in hell, that of cardinal Campe∣gio (who had once done him some ill offices abroad) with such a striking likeness, that every body knew it at first sight: upon which Campegio complained of the affront to his holiness, and de∣sired it might be erased. The pope replied, it was out of his power to oblige him. Why so? said Campegio. <HI>Because, said his holiness, we can only deliver out of purgatory, but not out of hell.</HI></P>

<P>A good old woman being at the Sardinian am∣bassador's chapel, took two wax tapers, and set one of them before the image of St. Michael, and the other, without thinking what she did, before the devil, which stood at his feet; the priest tak∣ing notice of it, began to say to her, Alas, good woman, what are you about? don't you perceive that he you offer a candle to is the devil. To whom the woman replied, No matter, my good sir, <HI>'tis good to have friends every where, in hell as well as in heaven, for we don't know where we may go.</HI></P>
<P>A certain man who was a great wit, shewed one of his sonnets to a person that was crooked, and was looked upon as a poet; but the silly fel∣low had no sooner read it, when he began to des∣pise it, saying, it was ill made.

<P>A Scotchman was walking in depth of winter upon the new bridge at Paris, with only a thin white linen doublet on, with stockings of the same stuff, a little camblet cloak, and a sword by his side; the king happened to pass that way, and seeing this man in such a dress at that time of the year, was curious to know the reason of it; upon which he commanded him to be called: He the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Oh, replies Sawney, if your majesty would but do as I do, you would never feel the least cold. How's that, says the king; Why if your majesty would but put on <HI>all your</HI> cloaths, as I put <HI>all mine,</HI> you would be warm enough. The king was so pleased with this secret, that he gave orders for his having a good winter suit.</P>
<P>A countryman desired a neighbour of his to lend him an ass, who told him that he had lent it to another, and that he was very sorry he had not asked him before: he had not yet done speak∣ing when the ass began to bray; oh, oh, says the peasant, d'ye hear; your ass says, that 'tis not true that you had lent him out; you are indeed a very obliging person: How, says the country∣man, would you sooner give credit to <HI>my ass than to myself.</HI></P>

<P>A great personage lately censured his brother very severely for his irregular course of life, and particularly on account of his unbridled passion for intrigue: you see, says he, what a sum I have to pay for you: not sensible of the disgrace you bring on your family, and how unworthy it is not to follow our better example.

<P>About half a century ago, when it was more the fashion to drink ale at Oxford than it is at present, a humorous fellow of punning memory, established an ale-house near the pound, and wrote over the door, "Ale sold by the pound." As his ale was as good as his jokes, the Oxonians resorted to his house in great numbers, and sometimes staid there beyond the college hours. This was made a matter of complaint to the vice-chancellor, who was desired to take away his licence by one of the proctors of the university. Boniface was sum∣moned to attend; and when he came into the vice-chancellor's presence, he began hawking and spitting about the room <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this the chancellor ob∣served, and asked what he meant by it? Please your worship I came here on purpose to <HI>clear</HI> my∣self. The vice-chancellor imagined that he actu∣ally weighed his ale, and sold it in that manner; he therefore said to him—they tell me that you sell ale by the pound, is that true? No, replied the wit. How do you then? replied the chan∣cellor:—Very well, I thank you, Sir, replied he, how do you do? The chancellor laughed and said <HI>get away for a rascal,</HI> I'll say no more to you. The fellow departed and passing the quadrangle, met the proctor who laid the information. Sir, said he, the vice-chancellor wants to speak with you, and returned with him. Here Sir, said he, here he is.—Who? said the chancellor. <HI>Why
<PB N="41" REF="028656_0040_0FDA3D259E89B020"/>Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>you sent me for a rascal, and I've brought you the greatest that I knew of.</HI></P>

<P>An arrogant Englishman passing through New-Jersey in the stage, entered into a lengthy detail in praise of the severity of British discipline, and observed as an instance, that two soldiers in Corn∣wallis's army were hung merely for robbing a hen-roost. A facetious Jerseyman in company, said, it was a pity this discipline had not been enforced among Lord Howe's men when he in∣vaded New-Jersey. Why, so? says the English∣man. Because, sir, replies the Jerseyman, we should have been happily rid of such rascals, for his lordship and his whole army would have been hung together.</P>

<P><HI>The</HI> Parson <HI>and the</HI> Fowls; <HI>or, the</HI> Maid <HI>too cunning for her</HI> Master.</P>
<P>A rich old bachelor, a clergyman in the coun∣try, having made choice of a pretty young maid to be his house-keeper, had ordered upon a cer∣tain Sunday, a couple of fowls to be got read for his dinner, that after he had given his congrega∣tion a little Christian consolation at church, he might come home and refresh his tired vitals with a dainty modicum; when the clerk and his loo∣bily assistants had chimed all in, for about a quar∣ter of an hour, away jogged the shepherd to fod∣der his sheep, and measure his time by the hour glass, leaving his pretty housekeeper to prepare
<PB N="45" REF="028656_0044_0FDA3D28B1872360"/>the cacklers against the accostomed time of his return.</P>
<P>The diligent maid, when she thought her ghost∣ly master had been long enough exalted two de∣grees above his clerk, to get about a quarter of an hour on the right side of his text, guessed it a very proper time to lay down the fowls, which she did accordingly. As the tidbits were running merrily round before a rousing fire, who should take the advantage of the parson's absence, but his housekeeper's sweetheart, who by his pleasant, comical hoity-toities, and other winning accom∣plishments, had so wriggled himself into her af∣fections, that it is not unreasonable to think he had as much command as her master.</P>
<P>The maid having mistaken the time of the day, happened to be a little too early with her cooke∣ry, so that the fowls were full ready before the parson had given his hungry auditory leave to re∣turn home to their puddings and dumplings. The sweetheart being a fellow of an incomparable stomach, thought it a great pity, such good victu∣als should be spoiled for want of eating, and very eagerly solicited his loving Jug to spare him one of the fowls to stop a little hole he had in his ap∣petite, telling her one would be sufficient for her master, and that she had wit enough to contrive some story or other, handsomely to excuse the matter, and blind him from the true knowledge of what became of it.</P>
<P>The maid being willing to oblige her lover, who she found was so desirous to oblige her upon all occasions, ventured to take up one to save the
<PB N="46" REF="028656_0045_0FDA3D5E7B5E2A78"/>longing of her sweetheart who being very well prepared for such a nice entertainment, gobbled it up with such expedition, that before his bene∣factress had wound up the jack, he had not so much as left the claws which the poor cockral u∣sed to scratch the dunghill withal.</P>
<P>He had no sooner dispatched his sweetheart's first courtesy, but he began to be very importu∣nate with her for the second, telling her an ex∣cuse was as easy made for both as for one, and that she had as good be hanged for a sheep as a lamb; till at last, by adding a few melting kisses to his ravenous solicitations, he prevailed upon her to draw the other off the spit, that he might finish his meal by robbing the parson of his Sunday's dinner.</P>
<P>The second bird being brought before him, he lost no time, but drove down the former with the latter, without any visible abatement of either his speed or of his appetite. When he had cleared the dish, and washed all down with a cup of the parson's best beer, he took a thankful leave of his mistress, who now began to be at her wit's end how to excuse the rudeness she had so foolishly committed.</P>
<P>As she was thus pondering with herself, who should step in but the parson and a stranger with him, who coming from another town to hear him preach, the parson thought himself obliged to in∣vite him home to dinner with him.</P>
<P>No sooner had the old Levite conducted his guests into the parlour, but he begged his pardon a minute and retired into another room to whet his knife upon the frame of an old table, which
<PB N="47" REF="028656_0046_0FDA3D29D54FA870"/>was always his custom before dinner; the maid in a peck of fears and troubles took the advantage in the interim, and stepping into the parlour, in a strange seeming sort of disorder, frightens away her master's guest with a surprising story, as fol∣lows, viz. Lord, sir, how came you to venture yourself home with my master, at this time of day, when if you had known him, you might have easily discovered by his countenance, he is in one of his old freaks.—Why, what's the matter with him, says the country farmer, he was woundy ci∣vil to me in the church-yard, and by all means would bring me home to dine with him. Alas, good sir, replied the maid, whatever you do, let me advise you to make the best of your way out of the house, for if you stay, now he is in one of his frenzical humours, he will certainly g— you; and I dare say, he is whetting his knife for that purpose; he has lately served two or three so al∣ready, though they have had the discretion to keep it silent, because they should not be laughed at. I thank thee kindly sweetheart, cry'd the countryman, are these his tricks—wounds, shew me the nearest way out. Upon which the wench shewed him out of a back door, and away ran Gaffer as if the devil was at his heels.</P>
<P>He had not been gone a minute, but in comes the parson with his knife in his hand, and finds the maid stamping and storming, as if she was ray∣ing mad in the parlour, with an empty sineared dish upon the table, and his guest gone. What's the matter now, says the parson, what's the mean∣ing of all this, where is the man gone that I
<PB N="48" REF="028656_0047_0FDA3D5FD8C483E0"/>brought home with me? Lord, sir, replien the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

Zounds, saith the priest, I am resolved the impuden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fellow shall not cozen me of my dinner so, and away runs the parson after the countryman, who by this time had got near a field's length off; but however, having preach∣ed himself very hungry, he trotted away after him, with his naked knife in his hand, crying out, give me, you brazen dog, what you have run a∣way with in your breeches. The fellow answer∣ing as he ran, Efaith doctor not I, I would ra∣ther see you hanged first. The parson finding the fellow too nimble for him, was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to compound, and cried out, in milder terms, Pri∣thee, friend, don't run away with them both, but be so kind to let me have one of them. Not by the mass, replie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fellow, I had rather see you at the devil than part with either of them. The farmer being young and lusty, soon got ground of the parson, that he was forced to give over his chace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d return home puffing and blowing, having nothing left but <HI>batchelors fare, bread and cheese, and kisses for his Sunday's dinner.</HI></P>

It happened just then, that the house was breaking up; and the door being presently opened, the countryman, to his great astonishment, saw several of the members hasten∣ing towards it; upon that he immediately takes to his heels, and runs, as it were, for his life: when being stopped by some persons, who wondered at his running so fast, "Oh!

<P>The famous Weston, of facetious memory, hav∣ing borrowed the sum of five pounds, and failing in payment, the gentleman who had lent the mo∣ney, took occasion indiscreetly to talk of it in the public coffee-house, which obliged Weston to take notice of it; so that it came to a challange. Be∣ing got into the field, the gentleman a little ten∣der in the point of courage, offered him the note to make it up, to which our hero readily consent∣ed, and had the note delivered. But now, said the gentleman, if we should return without fight∣ing, our companions will laugh at us; therefore let us give one another a slight scratch, and say we wounded one another. With all my heart, says Weston, come, I'll wound you first; so drawing his sword, he whipt it through the fleshy part of his antagonist's arm, till he brought the tears in his eyes. This done and the wound tied up with a handkerchief; Come, said the gentle∣man, Where shall I wound you?—Weston put∣ting himself in a posture of defence, Where you can, by G—d, Sir." "Well, well, says the o∣ther, I can swear I received this wound of you;" and so marched off contentedly.</P>
<P>The Emperor Charles V. having wandered up and down for a good while in a forest, where he had lost his way in hunting, found himself at last
<PB N="51" REF="028656_0050_0FDA3DA2181632E0"/>near a public house, whither he went to refresh himself. As he came in, he espied four fellows, whose looks forbode him no good; however, he put a good face upon the matter, sat down and called for something to eat and drink. The fel∣lows who were lying down and pretended to be asleep, thought fit to awake. I dreamed, said one of these ruffians, coming near the Emperor, "That I was taking off your hat;" and so he took it. For my part, says another, "I dream∣ed that your great coat would fit me exactly;" and without any more ado, he fairly stript him of it. The third paid him the same compliment, and stripped him of his buff coat. The fourth rogue with the same good manners, went about to take from off his neck a gold chain, where a whistle was hanging. Hold a little, says the Emperor, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing back his hand, before you take this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar whistle from me, give me leave to teach you the virtue of it; <HI>you must do so.</HI> Then having given a loud whistle, his attendants, who were looking for him, and by chance were got near that house, as soon as they heard the whistle, came in, and were very much surprised to find him in that con∣dition.

<P>A country justice invited Edwin one day to dinner, with many other persons; and having a mind to shew his wit, took these aside and told them, "Gentlemen, if you'll be ruled by me, we shall make ourselves merry to day with Edwin, who you know sets up for a jester, and drolls up∣on every body. My clerk being sick a bed, so that I have no body to wait on us, I will propose to draw cuts, to see which of us shall go to the cellar to draw the wine, and wait on the rest whilst they are at dinner: and I will contrive it so, that it shall fall to Edwin's lot." Which be∣ing thus concluded amongst them, was put into execution accordingly. Edwin smoaked the plot, and was resolved to make his host repent it. Down he went to the cellar to fill the bottles, whilst the others fell too; and being come up a∣gain with the bottles, "You see, Gentlemen, said he, how I have performed what I had to do; let us now draw cuts <HI>to see which of us shall go down into the cellar to stop the hogsheads I have left run∣ning.</HI>" Now the justice talked no more of casting lots, and knowing Edwin to be as good as his word, leaves presently his dinner, and runs to the cellar, where he finds his vessels running, and part of his wine spilt, for which he afterwards expostulated with Edwin.

<P>The following story is related of the king of Prussia. A clergyman of Neufchatel chapel preached against eternal d—n. His parish∣ioners were so disgusted with him, that they would not afterwards suffer him to enter the church-door, nay, they even pelted him. The king hearing of it, ordered the doors to be thrown open to the priest, that he might resume his func∣tion. The parson now resumed his subject. He would not allow eternal d—n by any means; he had no objection to a limited time, even a hundred thousand years, but not infinite punish∣ment. The parishioners would not suffer him to go on with his sermon, but pulled him headlong from his rostrum, turned him out of the church, and again pelted him. The king sent for the priest, and censured him for his absurdity in resu∣ming a subject so noxious to his bearers, and said, "Since my subjects of Neufch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> are so fond of everlasting d—n, they have my free leave to be d—ned to all eternity."</P>
<P>At the assize of Caernarvon, where judge Bar∣rington presided, a simple Welshman was tried for some petty offence. The judge in an austere manner, asked him, "What are you?" To which the culprit replied, in his shire manner, "My Lord, I was sell ale by the pound!" "Eh,

"Pretty well, I thank your lordship, I hope you are well," replied the rustic, with such a simplicity in his manner, that threw the court into a fit of laughter that lasted for a quarter of an hour. His lordship was as merry as the rest, and leaned to his case in such a manner that he was acquitted.</P>
<P>When Sir Thomas Moore was ambassador from Henry VIII. to the emperor of Morocco, the morning he was to have an audience, he called for a bumper of sack, drank it, and asked for ano∣ther; the servant would have dissuaded him from it, but could not; he drank that off, and after∣wards a third; he then insisted on a fourth; but being over persuaded by his servant, he let it a∣lone. When he returned from his audience, "You rogue, said he to his man, what mischief have you done me, I spoke so well to the empe∣ror, on the inspiration of the three glasses I drank, that he told me I was fit to govern three parts of the world. Now, you scoundrel, had I drank the fourth glass, I had been fit to govern the whole world."</P>
<P>One day Socrates, having for a long time en∣dured his wife's brawling, went out of his house and sat down before the door, to rid himself of her impertinence. The woman, enraged to find all her scolding unable to disturb his tranquility, flung the contents of a chamber pot on his head. Those that happened to see it, laughed heartily at poor Socrates; but that philosopher told them,

<P>That excellent companion the old earl Bathurst, related the following anecdote: When the cele∣brated actress Mrs. Cibber was in Dublin, she sung in the Oratorio of the Messiah. A certain bishop was so struck with the extreme sensibility of her manner, that he could not refrain from saying, loud enough to be heard by numbers round him, "Woman! thy sins be forgiven thee!"</P>
<P>As the late Dean Swift was once upon a jour∣ney, attended by a servant, they put up at an inn, where they lodged all night; in the morning the Dean called for his boots; the servant immedi∣ately took them to him; when the Dean saw them, "How is this Tom, says he, my boots are not cleaned?" "No, Sir, replied Tom, as you are going to ride, I thought they would soon be dirty again;" "Very well, said the Dean, go and get the horses ready." In the mean time the Dean ordered the landlord to let his man have no breakfast. When the servant returned, the Dean asked if the horses were ready? "Yes, Sir," says the servant; "Go bring them out then," said the Dean; "I have not had my breakfast yet, Sir," says Tom; <HI>"Oh, no matter for that, says the Dean, if you had it you would soon be hungry again."</HI> They mounted and rode off; as they rode the Dean pulled a book out of his pocket and began to read, a gentleman met them and seeing the doctor reading, was not willing to

"I know that, you blockhead," said the gentleman, "but where are you going?" "We are going to heaven, Sir," says Tom. "How do you know that?" said the gentleman. <HI>"Because I am fasting and my master is praying,</HI> Sir, so I think we are in the right road."</P>
<P>Two friends, who had not seen each other for a long while, met one day by accident.—"How do you do?" says one. "So, so, replies the o∣ther, and yet I was married since you and I were together."—That is good news."—"Not very good; for it was my lot to choose a termagant."—"It is a pity."—"I hardly think it so, for she brought me two thousand pounds."—"Well, there is comfort."—"Not so much; for with her fortune I purchased a quantity of sheep, and they are all dead of the rot."—"That is indeed distressing."—"Not so distressing as you may imagine; for by the sale of their skins I got more than the sheep cost me."—"In that case you are indemnified."—"By no means; for my house and all my money have been destroyed by sire."—"Alas, this was a dreadful misfortune!"—"Faith not so dreadful; for my termagant wife and my house were burned together."</P>
<P>Alexander the Great asked Diomedes a famous pirate, who was brought prisonor to him, "why he was so bold as to rob and plunder in his seas?" he answered, "that he did it for his profit, as

<P>A gentleman having lent a guinea for two or three days to a person whose promises he had not much faith in, was very much surprized to find that he very punctually kept his word with him; the same gentleman sometime after was desirous of borrowing a larger sum.

<P>A gentleman amusing himself in the gallery of the <HI>Pallais,</HI> a place in Paris somewhat like what our exchanges formerly were, observed while he was carelessly looking over some pamphlets at a booksellers there, a suspicious fellow stood rather too near him: the gentleman was dressed, accord∣ing to the fashion of these times, in a coat with a prodigious number of silver tags and tassels: upon which the thief, (for such he was) began to have a design; and the gentleman, not willing to dis∣appoint him, turned his head another way, on purpose to give him an opportunity: the thief immediately set to work, and, in a trice, twisted off seven or eight of the silver tags: the gentle∣man immediately perceived it, and slily drawing out of his pocket a penknife, which cut like a ra∣zor, catched the fellow by the ear, and cut it off close to his head.

<P>In the war in Flanders, when the earl of Stair was commander in chief, after a severe battle, which lasted from morning till evening, and ter∣minated in favor of the British troops, a veteran soldier, excessively fatigued, was resting on his arms, and looking very grave; Lord Stair coming by, asked him why he looked so dull?

<P>Dr. Thompson was a peculiar sloven, and in the practice of a physician, an utter and declared enemy to muffins, which he always forbad his patients. Being one day upon a visit to Lord Melcombe, at Hammersinith, with Mr. Garrick, Mr. P. Whitehead, &amp;c. the company were assem∣bled at breakfast, long before the doctor appear∣ed: just as he entered the room, in an uncouth habit, Lord Melcombe uncovered a plate of muf∣fins, which Thompson fixing his eyes upon, with some indignation said, "My Lord, did not I be∣seech your lordship before, never to suffer a muf∣fin in your house?" To which his lordship archly replied, "Doctor, I've an utter aversion to muf∣fins and raggamuffins."</P>
<P>An Irish lad was sent to buy a piece of cheese;

He went back, and brought the other half; he was told upon tasting it, it was the same. "I'll take my bible oath of that, said he, for it is the other half; I saw the man change it with my own eyes;—you may buy your cheese yourselves for me."</P>
<P>Pope, who, whatever his other good qualities might be, certainly was not much troubled with good nature; was one evening at Button's coffee-house, where he and a set of literati had got po∣ring over a manuscript of the Greek comic poet Aristophanes, in which they found a passage that none of them could comprehend: as they talked pretty loud, a young officer who stood by the fire, heard their conference, and begged that he might be permitted to look at the passage. "Oh! says Pope, sarcas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cally, by all means, let the young gentleman lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k at it." Upon which the officer took up the book, and considering awhile, said, that there only wanted a note of interrogation to make the whole intelligible; which was really the case: "and pray, master," says Pope, qiqued, perhaps, at being cut-done by a red-coat, "what is a note of interrogation?"—"A note of inter∣rogation," replied the youth, with a look of the utmost contempt, "is a little crooked thing that asks questions." Tis said, however, that Pope was so delighted with the wit, that he forgave the sarcasm on his person.</P>
<P>The late Earl of Chatham, who bore no good∣will
<PB N="61" REF="028656_0060_0FDA3DAC71B99570"/>to a certain physician, was rallying him one day about the inefficacy of his prescriptions. To which the doctor replied, he defied any of his pa∣tients to find fault with him. "I believe you, replied the witty earl, for they are all dead!"</P>
<P>The mildness of Sir Isaac Newton's temper, through the course of his life, commanded admi∣ration from all who knew him, but in no one instance perhaps more than the following: Sir Isaac had a fa∣vorite little dog, which he called Diamond; and being one day called out of his study into the next room Diamond was left behind. When Sir Isaac returned, having been absent but a few minutes, he had the mortification to find, that Diamond hav∣ing thrown down a lighted candle among some papers, and the nearly finished labor of many years was in flames, and almost consumed to ashes. This loss, as Sir Isaac was then very far advanced in years, was irretrievable; yet, without once striking the dog, he only rebuked him with this exclamation, "Oh, Diamond! Diamond! thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done."</P>
<P>The following incident which occurred in a Caledonian courtship, exhibiting the true <HI>ridicu∣lum sublime,</HI> is as veritable as laughable:—A son of medicine (a doctor Shaw) in vital date climac∣terically verging, having purse as well as person in perspective, breathed out his amorous sighs to the daughter of a Scorch baronet: the lady, prone to jocularity, seemed to listen to his suit solely for the reception of that entertainment grey haired folly renders in attempting the cha∣racteristics
<PB N="62" REF="028656_0061_0FDA3D7412704E70"/>of juvenility. The doctor one day was to pay a visit in form to the goddess of his idolatry; on this occasion he was determined to be as Adonis-like in habiliments as possible. It is requisite to be known, that the doctor was a man who scorned to be thought of the sect of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tetics; when he appeared, it was in the style e∣questrian; and his steed, in lack of flesh, and shew of ossification, paced in singularity: on this auto∣maton of bones, he was to be carried to the house of the lady in question; and forward he set for the interview. The doctor was never remarked for a frequent mutation in linen; he had parti∣cular attachment for a shirt when once it met in contact with his skin, and before they were sepa∣rated the natural blanche of the one was some∣what improved by its intimacy with the other; on such an important event as the present, he was guilty of deviation, and resolving to be pro∣fuse, he took an immaculate shirt, and put it not on, but in his pocket, prudently considering, that in the action of riding its honors might be tarnish∣ed, and its appearance not so white; to prevent this, he resolved to put it on when he should ar∣rive at a small distance from the scene of his wishes. Arrived at this se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>led distance, the doc∣tor proceeded to disrobe his upper garments; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l sitting on his horse, his hat, his wig, his coat, and his waistcoat, were taken off, and laid on the pummel of the saddle; his hands were employed in stripping his sassron-hued skin-case over his head: In this critical moment, malignant fate reigning, his visual ray preluded by the covering
<PB N="63" REF="028656_0062_0FDA3DAF5DDF0C88"/>of his shirt, his faithful Pegasus received affright from somewhat in the road, set off with the doc∣tor in deminudity, and ran with him in <HI>statu qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (instinctively knowing, from frequency in going, his master's destination) to the door of the very house he had hoped to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er with every minutia of dress adjusted. His Quixote-like appearance threw the family into such paroxysms of laughter, as precluded the operations of speech, or the means of assisting the distressed doctor: the lady, in the doctor's disgrace, received the extremest entertainment, and though she liked human na∣ture in its primitive state, gave the doctor to un∣derstand his period in it was not her choice.</P>
<P>The late lord Ross engaged an apothecary, in Oxford Street, to attend three of his servants who were dangerously ill, and went to Ireland without discharging the account. In about two years after this event, he returned to London, and was traced by the apothecary, who knew his carriage, and stopt him in Bond-street. Lord Ross enquired for the bill, which the understrap∣per of Esculapius presented in at the window with a receipt. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sum total was sixteen pounds ten shillings and six-pence, which he thinking an ex∣orbitant charge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>led out his purse, gave the pharmacopolist half<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> guinea, and then ordered his coachman to drive on; but not before the en∣raged apothecary had surveyed the limited recom∣pense with surprize, and exclaimed, in the hearing of the mob, "Ah, you Irish bite, I have got six and three pence by you now."</P>

<P>The earl of Dorset having a great desire to spend an evening with Butler, the celebrated au∣thor of Hudibras, spoke to Mr. Fleetwood Shep∣herd to introduce him. The three wits, some time after, accordingly met at a tavern, when upon the first bottle, Butler was rather flat; on the second, he broke out the man of wit and reading; but on the third, relapsed into a tame∣ness of conversation, very inferior to the author of Hudibras. Next morning Mr. Shepherd asked his lordship how he liked his friend Butler? "I do not know any thing better to compare him to, says his lordship, than a roling pin, little at both ends, but great in the middle."</P>

<P>Two sailors, one Irish the other English, agreed reciprocally to take care of each other, in case of either being wounded in an action then about to commence. It was not long before the English∣man's leg was shot off by a cannon-ball; and on his calling to Paddy to carry him to the doctor, according to their agreement, the other very readily complied; but he had scarcely got his wounded companion on his back, when a second ball struck off the poor fellow's head. Paddy, who, through the noise and disturbance, common in a sea engagement, had not perceived his friend's last misfortune, continued to make the best of his way to the surgeon, an officer observ∣ing him with a headless trunk upon his shoulders, asked him where he was going? "To the doc∣tor," says Paddy. "The doctor! says the offi∣cer, why you blockhead the man has lost his head."

<P>The other day a captain of a vessel, had a quan∣tity of coals to put on board; as a great number lay scattered about the wharf, he thought it were best to have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake, that they might more speedily collect them together. He went himself into a counting-house and enquired of the merchant, whether he could have tho loan of a rake for a few minutes. The merchant smiled, and looking significantly round at his clerks, said, "I believe I have a number of them, but not one that will readily answer your purpose." The captain, comprehending the pun, very wittily replied, "I think you are quite right, sir, for neither of them, I suppose, would wish to be <HI>hauled over the coals.</HI></P>
<P>At the commencement of the late war, the very women became desirous to signalize the zeal they felt in their country's cause. At a meeting of the gentlewomen belonging to the county of Bristol, in Pennsylvania, they made a large col∣lection of money, to fit out a regiment raising
<PB N="88" REF="028656_0088_0FDA3DCF2157DBB0"/>there, and wrought a magnificent suit of colours for their use, with devices and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ottos of their own composing. The gentlewoman who was ap∣pointed by the others to present them in their name to the regiment, made a very gallant and spirited speech on that occasion, which she conclu∣ded by giving it in charge to the officers and sol∣diers, never to desert the <HI>colours of the ladies,</HI> if they ever wished, that the ladies should list <HI>under their</HI> banners.</P>
<P>Sir George Rooke, before he was made admi∣ral, had served as a captain of marines upon their first establishment; and being quartered upon the coast of Essex, the ague made great havoc amongst his men. The minister of the village where he lay was so harrassed with his duty, that he refused to bury any more of them, without being paid his accustomed fees. The captain made no words; but the next that died, he ordered him to be con∣veyed to the minister's house, and laid upon the table in his great hall: this greatly embarrassed the poor clergyman; who, in the fullness of his heart, sent the captain word, "That if he would cause the dead man to be taken away, he would never more dispute it with him; but would rea∣dily bury <HI>him</HI> and his <HI>whole company</HI> for nothing."</P>
<P><HI>The Three Kisses.</HI></P>
<P>In the summer 1782, a certain baronet sent his lady down to his country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat, being himself de∣tained by business in town, he was prevented for several days from following her. In the mean

<PB N="100" REF="028656_0089_0FDA3D92150C3EA0"/>time, one of his most intimate friends and dearest companions, proposed to the knight to pay a visit to his lady in his absence, with a view to divert her in her retirement, until the arrival of her husband. The knight not only gave his proposal a friendly reception, but gave him the following introductory bill, addressed to his lady:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"My dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"Please to pay the bearer, on sight, the full sum, or number of three kisses—value received—and place to account of, My dear, your's for ever."</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The lady, like an obedient wife, honored the bill on demand, but the friend, unluckily continued to draw such large sums of the same commo∣dity upon credit, the whole bank of love was at length exhausted, and the lady, on the arrival of her husband, (the knight) found herself a bank∣rupt in love to him. In a word the affair was discovered, and a divorce was sued for and ob∣tained. Never were the poet's words better veri∣fied than in this trifling business.</P>
<Q><L><HI>What dire effects from little causes spring!</HI></L></Q>
<P>Yet trifling as it is, it well serves to shew that beauty is not to be trifled with; and that the jewel chastity can never be guarded too strongly from the hands of rude spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, because the least touch will sully it.</P>
<P>A number of Irish gentlemen coming on a party of pleasure to London, a few weeks since, were becalmed midway between the harbor of Dublin and Parkgate. After surveying for some

To that they were no sooner seated, than, still warm with re∣cent patriotism, they characteristically drank, "The land we live in, and prosperity to it."</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield, being in one of the counties, on the circuit, a poor woman was indicted for witchcraft. The inhabitants of the place were exasperated against her. Some witnesses deposed, that they had seen her walk in the air, with her feet upwards and her head downwards. Lord Mansfield heard the evidence with great tran∣quility, and perceiving the temper of the people, whom it would not have been prudent to irritate, he thus addressed them: "I do not doubt that this woman has walked in the air, with her feet upwards, since you have all seen it; but she has the honor to be born in England as well as you and I, and consequently, cannot be judged but by the laws of the country, nor punished but in pro∣portion as she has violated them. Now I know not one law that forbids walking in the air with the feet upwards. We have all a right to do it with impunity. I see no reason, therefore, for prosecution; and this poor woman may return home when she pleases."—I his speech had its proper effect: it pleased the auditory, and the woman retired from court without molestation.</P>
<P>During the late war, when draughts were made from the militia, to recruit the continental army,
<PB N="102" REF="028656_0091_0FDA3D986AC591D8"/>a certain captain gave liberty to the men, who were draughted from his company, to make their objections, if they had any, against going into the service. Accordingly, one of them, who had an impediment in his speech, came up to the captain, and made his bow. "What is your objection?" said the captain. "I ca a-an't go, answers the man, because I st-st-stutter." "Statter! says the captain; you don't go there to talk but to fight." "Aye, but they'll p-p-put me upon g-g-guard, and a man may go ha-ha-half a mile be∣fore I can say, Wh-wh-who goes there?"—"Oh, that is no objection, for they will place some other sentry with you, and he can challenge, if you can fire." "Well, b-b-but I may be ta-ta-ken, and run through the g-g guts, before I can cry qu-qu-quarter." This last plea prevailed, and the captain out of humanity, (laughing heart∣ily) dismissed him.</P>

<P>Two sailors, who were travelling one fall to Philadelphia, stopped on the road at the inn of an historical old gentleman, a distant relation of Ba∣ron Munchausen, and called for a dinner. In the interim our host broached his magazine of miracles, and informed our roving tars, that had they arrived sooner he could have shewn them the greatest wonder in the known world. "I was blessed this year, said he, with such a miraculous and luxuriant crop of Indian corn, that in plough∣ing it I was obliged to have a candle carried be∣fore me at noon day, in order to light me along the furrows, for such was the darkness occasioned by the monstrous leaves of corn. When husking time came on, the corn had grown to such an amazing height, that I was under the necessity of having ladders erected against the stalks before I could have it gathered." "By St. Christopher, replied one of the tars, who was not inclined to be out done, that is not half so great a wonder as we have seen, for before our late arrival on the American coast, we were overtaken by such a hard gale of wind, that it took ten men to hold one man's hair upon his head."</P>
<P>Not long since a swaggering blade, about <HI>three sheet in the wind,</HI> as the sailors express it, made his way into a barber's shop, sat himself down and desired to be shaved.

When this was done the gentleman arose and viewing himself in the glass, exclaimed, Why—why you d—n'd ras—rascal you have but half shaved me. No, sir, replied the barber, I thought there was no occasion to do more, for you was <HI>half shaved</HI> when you came.</P>
<P>One sailor coming to see another one pay-day, desired to borrow twenty shillings of him: The monied man fell to telling out the sum in shillings, but a half-crown thrusting its head in, put him out, and he began to tell again: but then an im∣pertinent crown-piece was as officious as his half-brother had been, and again interrupted the tale; so that taking up a handful of silver, he cried, "Here Jack, give me a handful when your ship's paid; <HI>what a pox signifies counting it?</HI>"</P>

<L>With many a tender bow,</L>
