<HEAD>The Evident <HI>Signatures</HI> of <HI>Divine Inspiration,</HI> in the <HI>first Pages</HI> of the HOLY ORACLES. In a brief <HI>Dissertation</HI> on the <HI>Three first Chapters</HI> of GENESIS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ANY excellent <HI>Pens,</HI> in our <HI>Nation,</HI> have of late Years appeared in De∣fence of <HI>Divine Revelation;</HI> which has been boldly attack'd, openly insulted, and sometimes profanely ridicul'd, by the <HI>Deists</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> of the present Day; with a Pre∣tence to <HI>superior</HI> Understanding and Judgment, and <HI>Freedom</HI> of Thinking; as if all beside <HI>Themselves</HI> were hoodwink'd and shackled by <HI>Prejudices of E∣ducation,</HI> or corrupted and restrained by <HI>Worldly
<PB N="2" REF="003887_0005_10020C9D51ACE700"/>Interests;</HI> and <HI>They</HI> alone were the Men of free Tho't, Sincerity and Courage, and <HI>Wisdom were to die with them.</HI></P>
<P>Great has been the <HI>Provocation</HI> to answer some of the more <HI>licentious</HI> and scurrilous <HI>Advocates</HI> for Infidelity according to their <HI>Folly,</HI> lest they be wise in their own Conceit: But great has been the <HI>Guard</HI> and Caution on the part of the noble and serious <HI>Defenders</HI> of the Divine Authority of the <HI>Bible,</HI> to write with Decency and Justice, Re∣verence and Gravity, Reason and Argument, on a Subject of so great Importance to the Honour of God and the Salvation of Souls. They have ne∣vertheless <HI>contended earnestly for the Faith,</HI> while they have given the <HI>Reason</HI> of it <HI>with Meekness of Wisdom;</HI> and Eno' has been said to <HI>convince Gain∣sayers,</HI> to <HI>stop the Mouths of unruly and vain Talkers,</HI> and to <HI>confirm the Souls of the Disciples.</HI></P>
<P>I am <HI>my Self</HI> in a particular manner obliged to mention, with great Acknowledgment, the Pleasure and Benefit I found in reading Dr. <HI>Thomas Burnet</HI>'s Demonstration of true Religion in a Chain of Scrip∣ture Consequences; and a later <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Revela∣tion examin'd with Candour;</HI> to which the follow∣ing <HI>Dissertation</HI> owes its Rise. It pretends not to any like <HI>Elaborateness,</HI> but is written for People of a lower Rank, who cannot rise to the <HI>Price</HI> of the fore-named Books. We write for the <HI>Places</HI> where we live, and for the <HI>People</HI> to whom we belong; and at the Request of <HI>Those</HI> to whom the follow∣ing <HI>Pages</HI> were acceptable and profitable from the <HI>Pulpit</HI> under another <HI>Form,</HI> I now publish them in <HI>this</HI> of a <HI>Dissertation</HI> on the <HI>first Chapters of the</HI> BIBLE.</P>
<P>If <HI>these first Pages in the Book of God</HI> do not appear worthy of his <HI>Inspiration,</HI> we may even give up the Rest of the <HI>Bible.</HI> If God has not
<PB N="3" REF="003887_0006_10020C46098C84E0"/>spoken to us by <HI>Moses,</HI> neither has He by the fol∣lowing <HI>Prophets;</HI> no, nor by JESUS and his <HI>A∣postles.</HI> But if it be Evident that <HI>Moses</HI> wrote by Inspiration of God, it is a sure and strong <HI>Foun∣dation</HI> for, and <HI>Argument</HI> of the Credibility of the whole Sacred <HI>Scriptures</HI> of the <HI>Old and New Testa∣ment;</HI> which we find bearing a strict <HI>Reference</HI> unto, <HI>Agreement</HI> with, and to be the <HI>Fulfilment</HI> of what <HI>Moses</HI> has written.</P>
<P>The whole of <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> the whole Doctrine of <HI>Christianity,</HI> stands on this Foot. The <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles</HI> all bear Witness to the Wri∣tings of <HI>Moses.</HI> The <HI>Old Testament</HI> ends with this, <HI>"Remember the Law of Moses my Servant!</HI> and the <HI>New</HI> begins and ends with the like Testimony to <HI>Him</HI> as Inspired of God, and sent by Him. It begins with leading us back to <HI>Moses,</HI> Joh. v. 39, 45, &amp;c. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and These are they that testify of Me: Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father; there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust: For had ye believed Moses ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me; But if ye believe not his Writings, how shall ye believe my Words?</HI> — And if we look to the <HI>Close</HI> of our <HI>Bi∣ble,</HI> we find it ending with <HI>"the Song of Moses and the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>I will not go into the <HI>Honours of Moses,</HI> as they are deliver'd to us in the Sacred Pages, lest it should seem a <HI>begging the Question</HI> before us; but let us only open our <HI>Bibles</HI> and read the short <HI>Narrative</HI> given of the <HI>Creation</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> and of <HI>Man</HI> upon it, his <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> and see whether it be not most worthy of the <HI>Majesty, Holiness</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> of the MOST HIGH; the most fit and proper <HI>Beginning</HI> of a <HI>Revelation</HI> of God to Man.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003887_0007_10020C9EE9B52B78"/>
The first Book of <HI>Moses</HI> is <HI>Historical.</HI> And it is the grand Honour of <HI>History</HI> that the <HI>Revelations</HI> of God begin thus. And if we weigh the Thing well we must needs judge that the Inspired <HI>Oracles</HI> must so begin. Lapsed and ignorant <HI>Mankind</HI> by <HI>Moses</HI> Time needed a <HI>History</HI> of their <HI>own</HI> Begin∣ning, their <HI>first</HI> State and the <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil. And this must be a <HI>Doctrinal History,</HI> concerning GOD and <HI>Themselves; how</HI> God made <HI>Them</HI> and all Things <HI>very good; what</HI> He made 'em <HI>for,</HI> and what He required of them; <HI>how</HI> they came into their present State of Sin and Misery, and what <HI>Way</HI> there is for their <HI>Recovery</HI> out of it. This is the <HI>Argument</HI> and Substance of the Book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> and more especially of the <HI>first three Chapters</HI> of it.</P>
<P>GOD there informs us first concerning HIMSELF, his Own ETERNAL BEING AND GODHEAD, and then concerning his <HI>Works,</HI> the Origine of the <HI>World,</HI> and the Manner and End of <HI>our own</HI> Formation. In what other, or better Manner, can we think that a Revelation from God should begin? The <HI>first Verse</HI> of the <HI>Bible</HI> shows it to be the <HI>Book of God: "In the Beginning God created the Hea∣vens and the Earth.</HI> What, but <HI>this,</HI> should be the <HI>first Line of Scripture?</HI> The DIVINE MAJESTY here speaks of <HI>Himself</HI> as the <HI>First Cause</HI> of all Things; That <HI>of Him and to Him are all Things,</HI> and <HI>for His Pleasure they are and were created.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> only true Foundation of all <HI>Science</HI> and of all <HI>Religion.</HI> It was not possible for <HI>Man</HI> to know any thing aright concerning Himself, or the Visible Works of God, till he knew this. <HI>This</HI> is the <HI>I∣mage</HI> and <HI>Superscription</HI> of God upon the <HI>Bible</HI> in the first Line of it. God being to write <HI>His Book,</HI> for the Use of the Sons of Men, thro' all Genera∣tions, put his <HI>Name</HI> before it in these Words, <HI>In the Beginning GOD created the Heavens and the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003887_0008_10020C4BD04F2FA8"/>
GOD is here represented as <HI>Self-Exisient,</HI> and in <HI>his own Times,</HI> as the <HI>blessed and only Potentate,</HI> giving unto all Things their Existence and <HI>Being,</HI> visible and invisible; by an Act of his <HI>Will,</HI> and a <HI>Word</HI> of his Power. How well does this first Line of <HI>Moses</HI> agree to the <HI>Psalm</HI> which bears his Name? Psal. xc. 2, 4. <HI>Before the Mountains were bro't forth, or ever Thou hadst formed the Earth and the World, from Everlasting to Everlasting Thou art God: For a thousand Years in thy Sight are but as Yesterday when it is past, and as a Watch in the Night.</HI> The <HI>Eternal</HI> God speaks by <HI>Moses</HI> of His own Eternity, how He was before all Things; and the <HI>Infinite</HI> God speaks of his own Infinity, his infinite Power which <HI>by a Word</HI> bro't the visible Heavens and Earth into their Being and Order; first command∣ed the <HI>Matter</HI> into Being, sufficient for the form∣ing the <HI>Universe,</HI> and then spake it into that <HI>Beauty</HI> and comely Proportion which our Eyes behold.— What, <HI>but This,</HI> ought the first Line of sacred Scripture to contain? He that does not see or read <HI>God</HI> in it is blind; and he that does not hear God speaking in it of Himself, has no Understanding of what he hears. The God of infinite Wisdom, Power and Goodness speaks of these his immense Perfections, in these <HI>few</HI> Words, as plainly and copiously as if <HI>Volumes</HI> were writ of them.</P>
<P><HI>In the Beginning,</HI> soil, of the <HI>Universe;</HI> when the <HI>Worlds</HI> came into Being, the upper and the lower; it was meerly by the Sovereign <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> of the LORD GOD; at what <HI>Time</HI> and in what <HI>Order. These Worlds</HI> had their Beginning, but GOD had none. God gave Them their Existence, <HI>when, where</HI> and <HI>how</HI> it pleased Him; and made all most <HI>good</HI> and <HI>perfect,</HI> for His <HI>Own</HI> Praise and Glory. There was <HI>no other</HI> Will, Wisdom, Good∣ness or Power to do this, but His who is THE ETER∣NAL;
<PB N="6" REF="003887_0009_10020CA0857B2708"/><HI>Who was, and is, and is to come; the same Yesterday, to Day and for Ever.</HI></P>
<P>This is but a just <HI>Paraphrase</HI> on the <HI>first</HI> Line of <HI>Scripture,</HI> which is <HI>Immense</HI> in Sense. The <HI>Fulness</HI> of the Eternal GODHEAD is in it, and <HI>all Things</HI> that God has made are in it too.—One might dwell and expatiate on this <HI>first Word of Moses</HI> for Ever, and never be able to think or say any thing on it adequate to the Fulness of Sense and Spirit in it.— In what <HI>other</HI> Words could the <HI>Book of God</HI> begin? O the Height and Depth, the Length and Breadth of this <HI>one</HI> Line! <HI>It is Light, without any Darkness at all!</HI> GOD dwells and shines in it! It is <HI>Light unapprochable and full of Glory!</HI> Here is the Be∣ginning and Finishing of the <HI>Creation</HI> of God in a Single Line! And then the DIVINE SPIRIT descends to that Part and <HI>Point</HI> of the Creation that belongs to <HI>Man,</HI> our <HI>Earth,</HI> and proceeds to speak of it.</P>
<P>Ver. 2. <HI>And the Earth was without Form and void, and Darkness was upon the Face of the Deep.</HI> This we must suppose, unless we should rather think it becoming the Glory of God to give every <HI>Globe</HI> in the Universe its <HI>perfect</HI> Form at once. He could indeed as easily have done this, but I think the Glory of Divine Wisdom and Goodness more dis∣played in the <HI>gradual Process</HI> related by <HI>Moses.</HI> God had first created the <HI>Heavens</HI> and Hosts of glorious <HI>Angels,</HI> a World of bright <HI>Intelligences</HI> to behold the lower Worlds, take their Place, Form and Motion. And as these were finishing from Day to Day, one Part after another, and every Part more and more perfective of the Whole, those <HI>blessed Spectators sang together</HI> and shouted forth the Praises of that infinite Perfection, which they saw with Wonder in every step: As we read <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii. 7.</P>
<P>The most perfect <HI>Idea</HI> that the Mind of Man can now frame concerning the Formation of our <HI>Earth,</HI> and so of the other <HI>Planets</HI> within our
<PB N="7" REF="003887_0010_10020CA2468E63F8"/><HI>Circle,</HI> is <HI>this,</HI> "That they were first <HI>a Chaos,</HI> or confus'd Particles of watry, oily, earthly, aery, and fiery Matter, blended together, without any distinct Order, Form or Beauty, a darksome <HI>Mass</HI> and Deep, which we should have been ready to think could never be bro't into any Order, Come∣liness and Use. We read that THE SPIRIT OF GOD <HI>moved</HI> on this Face of Disorder and vast Confusion: And who else should reveal to us what a <HI>void</HI> and formless thing the first <HI>Materials,</HI> or Collection of Matter, for such a World as this, must needs be?</P>
<P>And now, what would a considering <HI>Angel</HI> think should be the <HI>first Thing produced,</HI> or call'd forth in∣to some Appearance, out of this Darkness and Dis∣order? What should it be but LIGHT? And <HI>Moses</HI> tells us <HI>this</HI> was it, Ver. 3. <HI>And GOD said, Let there be Light, and there was Light.</HI></P>
<P>Did <HI>Moses</HI> conceive this? wise as he was and penetrating, even as an <HI>Angel</HI> of God, and learn∣ed in all the Phylosophy of <HI>Egypt?</HI> No, it was be∣yond the Ken of any humane Mind or Wisdom. How is it spoken <HI>like a GOD!</HI> and how <HI>God-like</HI> is the Account of the Production of one Thing and another? <HI>"GOD said, Let</HI> there be this and that! and <HI>let</HI> it be thus and thus! The Perfection of <HI>Wis∣dom</HI> saw at once <HI>how</HI> it should be, and the Perfec∣tion of <HI>Will</HI> said, <HI>Let it be so.</HI> He <HI>spake</HI> and it was done, He <HI>commanded</HI> and it immediately existed, and was established. Here is perfect <HI>Ease</HI> in the Production of every Thing; and in the <HI>Projection</HI> of it, if that Word be lawful. <HI>Moses</HI> could not have spoken thus of God and of His <HI>Work,</HI> if <HI>God</HI> had not spoken of Himself to him. And yet we cannot now possibly conceive of any other <HI>Man∣ner</HI> of Working worthy of the great GOD! and therefore we know that God spake by <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>Of all visible, <HI>material</HI> Things, which should be <HI>first</HI> in Order of <HI>Time,</HI> and which is first in Order
<PB N="8" REF="003887_0011_10020CA54DE55B98"/>of <HI>Nature,</HI> Use, Influence and Dignity, but LIGHT? By <HI>this</HI> all Things are seen, pervaded and enliven∣ed. For <HI>Heat</HI> accompanies Light, and it is (under the Will and Power of GOD) <HI>vital</HI> to all Things that live, grow and move, or act upon Earth.</P>
<P>That <HI>first Light</HI> was pleasant to the surrounding Hosts of <HI>Angels,</HI> how far soever it was below <HI>That</HI> of <HI>their</HI> Celestial Regions. From their high World of Light and Glory they came to see a new World of Material Beauties and Splendors rising from a <HI>Chaos.</HI> They heard the Voice from the Heavenly Glory say, Let <HI>Light</HI> be here below! and they saw it to be <HI>very good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GOD is Light.</HI> So He represents Himself unto us, because Light is the <HI>first-born</HI> of the Visible Creation. How does it <HI>excel</HI> Darkness! how did it spring forth <HI>out</HI> of Darkness, and shine in the Eyes of admiring Angels! <HI>Hail, Holy Light!</HI> they cried: Our <HI>Milton</HI> learn'd it of Them in his <HI>Dark∣ness.</HI> And so our late <HI>Angel</HI> of a Man, Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> in his Exposition: <Q><HI>Light</HI> says he, which of all Things seen does most resemble it's great <HI>Parent</HI> in Beauty and Blessings, in Purity Brightness and Beneficence, in Spirituality Immensity and Immutability.</Q></P>
<P>GOD is the <HI>Father of Light, from Whom every good and perfect Gift comes down; and with Him there is no Variableness, nor Shadow of Change.</HI> So in the <HI>New Creation</HI> Light is the <HI>first</HI> Thing formed. GOD <HI>gives the Light of the Knowledge</HI> of his more Spiritual <HI>Glory, in the Face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>The <HI>Order</HI> of the Creation is <HI>admirable</HI> and <HI>per∣fect</HI> as it is related by <HI>Moses;</HI> yet it could not have enter'd into the Heart of <HI>Man</HI> to have conceived of it, if God had not revealed it to Him. As soon as the Light shone out of Darkness, God stretched out a <HI>Firmament,</HI> He made an <HI>Atmosphere</HI> about
<PB N="9" REF="003887_0012_10020C4E3711CF10"/>the Earth, an Expansion of <HI>Air,</HI> the higher and lower Region of it, of various Use and vast Bene∣fit, and of the last Necessity for the Growth of eve∣ry <HI>Vegetable,</HI> and for the Life and Motion of every <HI>Animal.</HI> The Mass of Water and Earth was here∣by left a distinct Body by it self. In this <HI>Firmament</HI> of Heaven the <HI>Vapours</HI> ascend from the Ends of the Earth, the <HI>Winds</HI> blow, the <HI>Clouds</HI> roll, and God rides on them, &amp; plays his dreadful Artillery, the <HI>Lightning and Thunder,</HI> which purifies the Air for us, while it makes us tremble. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndly <HI>deceives</HI> our Sight, and makes Things seem <HI>near</HI> to us at inconceivable Distances, and our Eyes receive Objects thro' an immeasurable Space, the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Stars,</HI> with Ease and Pleasure. Hereby the Light and Heat and Rains <HI>descend</HI> on us, in fit Proportions to make the Earth fruitful; the Grass grows for the <HI>Cattle,</HI> Herbs and Corn and Fruits for the Service of <HI>Man;</HI> the glorious Works of God are <HI>seen</HI> and contem∣plated by us, and vital <HI>Heat</HI> is convey'd to our Hearts, and preserv'd in our Blood. — Such is the <HI>Firmament</HI> which God has spread over us, <HI>the Pavement of his Feet,</HI> but <HI>the Breath of our Nostrils. Moses</HI> has told of <HI>it,</HI> as the wondrous Work of God, accompanying the <HI>Light,</HI> which how should it <HI>glare,</HI> or be at all visible, but thro' a Vehicle of <HI>Air?</HI> In <HI>this,</HI> under God, whose Visitation pre∣serves our Spirits, <HI>we live and move and have our Being.</HI></P>
<P>And now God gather'd the Mass of <HI>lower Waters</HI> into one Place, into one vast Body, or Collection of it, and the <HI>dry Land</HI> appeared. <Q><HI>The Sea is His for he made it; &amp; his Hands formed the dry Ground: In his Hands are the deep Places of the Earth, &amp; the Strength of the Hills is his also.</HI></Q> GOD formed it a <HI>Terra∣queous Globe,</HI> Land and Water; both alike necessa∣ry and beauteous in their Kind and Place. He
<PB N="10" REF="003887_0013_10020CA99B08F1B8"/>bad the <HI>Earth</HI> to bring forth the Grass and Herb and Trees, even before there was a <HI>Sun</HI> in the Fir∣mament of Heaven, say <HI>some;</HI> but <HI>others</HI> chuse on∣ly to say, before its Heat and Light <HI>broke thro'</HI> the exhaled Vapours, drank up the <HI>dark Waters</HI> and scatter'd the <HI>thick Clouds of the Sky.</HI> The Moon and Stars then appeared in their Courses, and Day and Night commenced, Months and Years. The same <HI>Circle</HI> and <HI>System of Planets</HI> and <HI>fix'd Stars,</HI> which are beheld by us at this Day, but can never be eno' admir'd by the Sons of Men, <HI>shone out</HI> at once on this Terraqueous Globe of ours.</P>
<P>But as yet no <HI>Eye</HI> was formed to behold and view them; no not so much as the Eye of a <HI>Fish</HI> in the Waters of an <HI>Animal</HI> on the Land, or of an <HI>Insect</HI> in the Air. Now therefore it pleased God to command the Waters to bring forth the <HI>moving Creatures</HI> in them, great and small; and the <HI>Fowl</HI> to fly in the open Firmament. He fill'd the <HI>Sea</HI> with Fish, and things creeping innumerable; and the <HI>Air</HI> with feather'd Fowl, of every Wing and Size. Angels beheld with vast Delight the <HI>Life,</HI> the Beauties and Motion of them all. — Who could have led <HI>Moses</HI> down into and thro' these <HI>Depths</HI> of the Sea, and up into all these <HI>Heights</HI> of the Air, to trace out the Original of the Inhabi∣tants of both; but only GOD the Former of them all, and the Fountain of <HI>Life</HI> unto all? For there is not the most inferior Life in Air or Water, but what loudly tells us of the <HI>living</HI> JEHOVAH, the GOD of <HI>Moses, Who only hath Life in Himself, and giveth unto all Life and Breath and all things.</HI></P>
<P>God made 'em to <HI>propagate</HI> their Life; to in∣crease, multiply in, and replenish the Sea, the Air and Earth. He added his <HI>Blessing</HI> on Them for this End, which is effectual to this Day, and with∣out which every living Thing had been <HI>barren</HI> and
<PB N="11" REF="003887_0014_10020C55AF0D6518"/>fruitless for Ever.—O the <HI>Riches,</HI> and Profusion of <HI>Bounty,</HI> in the Living Creatures that <HI>communi∣cate</HI> the Life-which they receive, thro' all <HI>Ages</HI> of the World, as long as <HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI> shall endure.</P>
<P>This Power and Goodness <HI>inexhaustible</HI> flowed on, and rose higher and higher, till the <HI>dry Land</HI> was also stor'd with <HI>Beasts,</HI> and <HI>Cattle</HI> and <HI>every creeping Thing</HI> after their Kind; and then MAN was last of all formed, with a <HI>Solemnity</HI> and <HI>Plea∣sure</HI> peculiar to the <HI>Superior Creature</HI> on Earth; designed to be the <HI>Lord</HI> of all the Creatures in Air, on Earth and in the Seas, and to bear the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Likeness</HI> of the CREATOR of all. Gen. i. 26, 27. —ii. 7. <HI>And God said, Let us make Man in our I∣mage, after our Likeness: and let Them have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattle, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth. So God created Man in His own Image, in the Image of God created He him; Male and Female created He them: And God blessed them, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the Earth, and subdue it; and have Dominion &amp;c:— The Lord God formed Man of the Dust of the Ground and breathed into his Nostrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a Living Soul.</HI></P>
<P>What should be the <HI>Image</HI> of the LIVING GOD, in Heaven or on Earth, but <HI>living Spirits?</HI> intelli∣gent and immortal Creatures, made after the Power of an <HI>endless Life.</HI> Who but <HI>These</HI> should be made for <HI>Dominion</HI> in one World or the other? God is the <HI>Father of Spirits</HI> and the <HI>Fountain of Life.</HI> The Life of <HI>Angels</HI> and of <HI>Souls</HI> is of Him and to Him. The <HI>living Beings</HI> in every World must worship <HI>Him that liveth for ever and ever,</HI> and cast their <HI>Crowns</HI> before His Throne; for they are all <HI>crown∣ed</HI> with Glory and Honour, in <HI>His Image</HI> on them.</P>

And all these also go into every <HI>moral Perfection</HI> of the Divine Nature. God is therefore a <Q>SPIRIT infinite, eternal, unchange∣able in his Being, Wisdom, Power, Holiness, Justice, Goodness and Truth.</Q></P>
<P>Man in his <HI>Immortality</HI> may be said to bear <HI>some</HI> Image of the <HI>Everlasting Life</HI> of God. But the <HI>Moral Perfections</HI> of God must <HI>necessarily</HI> be com∣municated to Reasonable Creatures, in a Degree and Measure suitable to their Place in the Creation of God, in order to their Acting wisely, holily, justly; with Goodness and Truth. The <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us that <HI>this</HI> was the Image and Likeness of God, wherein Man was created, and to which He is in part restored in his Sanctification. Eph. iv. 24. <HI>Renewed in the Spirit of your Mind, and after God created in Righteousness and true Holiness.</HI> Col. iii. 10. Renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of Him that created him.</P>
<P>MAN is a <HI>living Soul,</HI> not only in respect of Im∣mortality, but as he is an <HI>Intelligent, Self-conscious</HI> Creature, made a <HI>Law</HI> to Himself, and for <HI>Self-Government;</HI> an Agent by Counsel, accountable to <HI>God,</HI> to his own <HI>Conscience,</HI> and to the <HI>Societies</HI> to which he belongs. He feels and shows <HI>the Work of the Law written in his Heart, his Conscience bearing him Witness, and his Thoughts excusing or accusing,</HI> and binding him over to the Eternal <HI>Judgment</HI> of God, Rom. ii. 15, 16.</P>
<P>Sense, Reason and Experience do all testify to us that the other <HI>Animals</HI> on Earth are not such <HI>Living Souls,</HI> as these which we feel within our Selves. As they have no Conscience of Right and Wrong, so no Knowledge or Fear of a holy Maker and Judge. They are not capable of contemplat∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="003887_0016_10020CAD4E978CC8"/>God in his Works, nor of giving Glory to him in Acts of Worship and Obedience. But <HI>the Soul of Man</HI> is as evidently made for those Exercises of Religion, to <HI>glorify God with his Body and Spirit;</HI> having the <HI>Presages</HI> of a future and everlasting State in present Hopes and Fears.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Moses</HI> is the <HI>first</HI> who told the Sons and Daughters of Men in <HI>Writing</HI> of their being cre∣ated these <HI>living Souls,</HI> for these superior and holy Ends. And this is the <HI>first Thing</HI> he tells them concerning Themselves, which highly becomes a <HI>Revelation</HI> from God, to let us know our Selves to be the <HI>Offspring of God;</HI> that He has <HI>taught us more than the Beasts of the Earth, and made us Wiser than the Fowls of Heaven,</HI> and expects more from us. This stands excellently well in the Account given us of our <HI>Creation.</HI> God knows the <HI>Soul</HI> which he has made, and tells it <HI>what</HI> it is, &amp; leads it to <HI>Himself,</HI> by showing it his own <HI>Image</HI> in it self.</P>
<P>No Writer before <HI>Moses</HI> has told Mankind how they came into Being, in what a <HI>Glory</HI> they were created, in what Rectitude and Perfection. And surely a Revelation from God to Man should be∣gin with such an Account of his <HI>Original</HI> and first State; "<HI>Who</HI> made him, <HI>how</HI> he was made, <HI>what</HI> he was made for; that God made him <HI>very good,</HI> and <HI>for Himself;</HI> for Glory <HI>to</HI> Himself from Man, and for Blessedness <HI>in</HI> Himself unto him.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Moses</HI> writes of GOD who was before the World, and of His making it in such a Manner as becomes the Wisdom, Goodness, Holiness and E∣ternal Power of God. <HI>Moses</HI> could never have undertaken and perform'd <HI>This,</HI> but under the In∣spiration of God. <HI>Known to</HI> HIM, and to Him alone, <HI>are all his Works from the Beginning to the End.</HI> Had <HI>Moses,</HI> or any <HI>One</HI> else, presum'd to have told the Manner and Order of the Creation
<PB N="14" REF="003887_0017_10020CB08EA9CCA8"/>of their own Head, they had justly incurr'd the fearful Words of the ALMIGHTY <HI>out of the Whirl∣wind,</HI> Job xxxviii. 2,—6. <HI>Who is this that darkneth Counsel by Words without Knowledge? Gird up now thy Loyns like a Man; for I will demand of thee and answer thou Me. Where wast thou when I laid the Foundation of the Earth? declare if thou hast Understanding. Who laid the Measures thereof; if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the Line up in it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof fastned? or who laid the Corner-stone thereof? Or who shut up the Sea with Doors,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> was the <HI>boldest</HI> Man that ever wrote, the most <HI>daring</HI> and insolent, if <HI>not inspired</HI> from on High. Yet what can be more <HI>Reverend</HI> and <HI>Aw∣ful</HI> before God, than all his Words concerning Him and his Works! — What a Presumption had it been to have pretended to tell, Who the <HI>first Parents</HI> of Mankind were, how they came into Being, what God said to them, where he put 'em, and how they behav'd; if it were not from cer∣tain <HI>Tradition</HI> from the Mouth of <HI>Adam,</HI> or by im∣mediate <HI>Inspiration</HI> from Heaven? This Man <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> the wisest and <HI>meekest</HI> upon Earth, had shown himself the <HI>vainest</HI> and proudest, to write as he did at the End of <HI>two Thousand Years,</HI> without a cer∣tain <HI>Record</HI> left him to copy after, or the certain <HI>Impulse</HI> and Dictate of the SPIRIT OF GOD. But if God spake to him, and by him of his own Work, then the <HI>meeker</HI> he was the more sutable for God to speak by; for <HI>He resisteth the proud and giveth Grace unto the lowly.</HI></P>
<P>It looks indeed as if God spake to <HI>Moses</HI> in that he tells us that <HI>Man</HI> was created <HI>last</HI> of all the Works of God upon Earth. The Earth and the Creatures on it were made <HI>for Man,</HI> by <HI>Moses</HI> his Account; no doubt therefore but they were made <HI>before</HI> him. Man being the Top, the Crown, and
<PB N="15" REF="003887_0018_10020C7F86299B30"/><HI>Lord</HI> of the lower Creation, it was finished and perfected in his Formation. It agrees to the Wis∣dom, Goodness and Bounty of the Great CREATOR, that it was so. Thro' the whole Creation the <HI>less perfect</HI> was created <HI>first.</HI> The Advance is <HI>gra∣dual,</HI> by <HI>Moses</HI>'s Account; from Earth to Grass, from Grass and Trees to Cattle &amp; creeping Things, and then to <HI>Man</HI> in the Image of God.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> had no more any Hand in his own Com∣ing into Being, than any of the Inferiour Creatures. <Q>It was an <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> to Him to be made <HI>last.</HI> God built and furnish'd him a <HI>Palace</HI> for his Reception, being design'd to be the <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Vicercy</HI> here below.</Q> He did not come into an empty <HI>naked</HI> World, but found it richly <HI>stor'd</HI> with every Beauty and Bounty for Soul and Body. He had the <HI>Glories</HI> of the whole finished Creation for his <HI>Mind</HI> to contemplate, and all the <HI>Stores</HI> of Nature to regale his <HI>Appetite.</HI> Here was every Thing for Delight as well as Need; all that his Soul could wish for: Eno' to entertain his <HI>Wonder</HI> and raise his <HI>Gratitude,</HI> and fill him with <HI>Adorati∣ons.</HI> This was as became the Work of God.</P>
<P>Again that <HI>Man</HI> should be created with <HI>more So∣lemnity, Pause</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> than the other Crea∣tures, as <HI>Moses</HI> relates, is a Circumstance as credi∣ble as it is agreable. God had said, <Q><HI>Let the Wa∣ters bring forth the moving Creature, and let the Earth bring forth the living Creature;</HI></Q> but when the Formation of Man comes on the <HI>Style</HI> alters; and Reason good, on the Account of GOD, in whose Image Man was to be made. The words of God therefore were, <Q><HI>Let Us make Man in Our Image, after Our Likeness, and let Them have Do∣minion.</HI></Q> It was meet for the <HI>High GOD</HI> to put this <HI>Honour</HI> on <HI>His Own Image,</HI> in the Creature form'd for <HI>Dominion,</HI> and his own <HI>Worship.</HI> Ho∣nour and Majesty is put upon Him in his Superior
<PB N="16" REF="003887_0019_10020C4068308360"/>Nature, and therefore also in his Coming into Be∣ing. Psal. viii. 5, 6, 7. <HI>Thou hast made him a lit∣tle lower than the Angels, and crowned him with Glory and Honour; Thou madest him to have Domi∣nion over the Works of thy Hands, and hast put all things under his Feet.</HI> God pleased to distinguish this his crowning Work <HI>before</HI> he made Him, and <HI>in</HI> making him, and afterward. He spake of Him, as he made him, as having a special <HI>Delight in the Sons of Men; "Let Us make Man, Our own Image</HI> upon Earth, a <HI>living Spirit,</HI> a rational &amp; immortal Soul. This is said for <HI>Man's</HI> sake, as if he call'd <HI>a Council</HI> about forming him; that Man might reverence <HI>Himself,</HI> and love and praise his <HI>Maker.</HI> q. d. Let Us form this Creature for <HI>Our Self,</HI> in Knowledge and Sanctity, and for Immortality; to worship and obey Us, and be blessed in the High Enjoyment of our Favour for Evermore.</P>
<P>Man is <HI>sacred</HI> and dedicated to that Glorious TRINITY or GODHEAD, Who thus spake of him in the Day of his Creation. His reverend and duti∣ful <HI>Answer</HI> must be<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xxxviii. 16. Prov. xxxii. 8.</NOTE>, <HI>GOD that made us this Soul! The</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of God hath made me, and the Inspiration of the</HI> ALMIGHTY <HI>giveth me Understanding: For the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the</HI> LORD. <HI>Moses</HI> his ac∣count of Man's Formation highly becomes a Crea∣ture so Endowed from on High. The whole Ac∣count is worthy of GOD and of his Work. <HI>Less</HI> should not be said of it, and <HI>more</HI> ought not.</P>
<P>To go on: That Man should be created <HI>Male and Female,</HI> and but <HI>one Man and Woman,</HI> highly agrees to the Wisdom and Purity of God. That it <HI>was so,</HI> none but God could tell; unless the Tra∣dition might be had from <HI>Adam</HI> and his immediate
<PB N="17" REF="003887_0020_10020CB45F986100"/>Sons. That it <HI>should</HI> be so is in all respects desira∣ble; Even that all Mankind, thro'out all Ages, might be <HI>of one Blood,</HI> one Family, the Children of one Father and Mother, and love accordingly: And that according to the Original Pattern, only one Man and one Woman should joyn themselves in <HI>Marriage</HI> thro' all Generations; to preserve a chaste, a godly, a robust and healthy, and so a happy <HI>Seed.</HI> This is the <HI>Reasoning</HI> of the HOLY GHOST upon this Subject, toward the End of the <HI>Old Testament:</HI> Mal. ii. 15. <HI>Did He not make One? yet had He the Residue of the Spirit: And wherefore One? that He might seek a godly Seed. Wherefore take Heed to your Spirit, that none deal treacherously with the Wife of his Youth.</HI> The plain Meaning of the <HI>Prophet</HI> is this, God made but <HI>one Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> at first, as <HI>Moses</HI> tells us. He could have made <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twenty Females</HI> for the speedy Propa∣gation of Mankind, and to replenish the Earth, fast with Inhabitants. And if ever there could be Reason to think that God would allow more than <HI>one</HI> Woman to a Man, it had been to <HI>Adam,</HI> when the whole Earth was without another Inhabitant, and it could be peopled but very slowly from one Pair. Yet even in this Case God made but one <HI>Eve,</HI> and instituted the Purity of the Marriage Bed therein; that no one in any Case, or on any Pretence, should ever take more Wives than one at a Time, or break the Marriage Covenant by lusting after any other Woman. — And now, how worthy this Account of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> alone in the World, is of God their Maker, let the Experience of all the World speak, from the manifest and manifold Confusions to Persons and Families, to Body Soul and Estate, from having more Wives than one, or from the impure Mixtures of Fornication and Adultery. How necessary and honourable is Chastity and <HI>holy Matrimony</HI> to Mankind, whether we consider our
<PB N="18" REF="003887_0021_10020C5A50D68C00"/>selves as reasonable, or as religious social Creatures? The bodily Health is consulted by the Law of <HI>Marriage,</HI> and the Health of the Soul more: It was meet therefore for the Father and Preserver of Men to make This one of his <HI>first</HI> Laws and Insti∣tutions, as <HI>Moses</HI> tells us He did.</P>
<P>As One says, <Q>Since <HI>Adam</HI> was confined to one Wife, it is a sufficient Intimation that his <HI>Sons</HI> should be so; and that the Bond of Marriage is not to be dissolved at Pleasure.</Q> So our <HI>Lord</HI> JESUS has taught us to reason; Mat. xix. 3,—8. <HI>The Pharisees came unto Him, tempting him and say∣ing, "Is it lawful for a Man to put away his Wife for every Cause? And he answered and said unto them, "Have ye not read, that He which made them at the Beginning, made them Male and Female? and said, For this Cause shall a Man leave Father and Mother, and shall cleave unto his Wife; and they twain shall be one Flesh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one Flesh. What therefore God hath joyned together, let not Man put asunder. They soy unto Him, Why did Moses then command to give a Writing of Divorcement, and put her away? He saith unto them, Moses because of the Hardness of your Hearts suffered you to put away your Wives; but from the Beginning it was not so.</HI> No Permission or In∣dulgence to any in Times past, no not to <HI>Abraham</HI> or <HI>Jacob</HI> themselves, or to any of their Posterity, may be pleaded for an Exemption from this <HI>Ori∣ginal</HI> Intention and <HI>Constitution</HI> in Man's <HI>Creation;</HI> but this must determine Us, — <HI>Adam</HI> had but one Wife, <HI>"Eve</HI> had but one Husband.</P>
<P>In the next place, <HI>Moses</HI> tells us that as soon as God had form'd this <HI>lovely happy Pair,</HI> and brought them together, <HI>He blessed them.</HI> A Particular truly becoming the <HI>Father of their Spirits;</HI> the <HI>For∣mer</HI> of their Bodies, and the Lover of his <HI>Own Image</HI> in them. He had made 'em holy, wise, per∣fect;
<PB N="19" REF="003887_0022_10020CB608A52A50"/>for Happiness in one another, and for Bles∣sedness in Himself and in a better Life; and no wonder that He <HI>blessed</HI> 'em, rejoycing in his own Work. He blessed the <HI>Fish</HI> and the <HI>Fowl</HI> as they came into <HI>Being,</HI> and so the other Living Creatures that were made to propagate and multiply; for his Work was all <HI>Honourable and Glorious;</HI> but the Blessing of <HI>Man</HI> far excecded that on the inferior Creatures; as He was made greater and better than they. — Let the Sons and Daughters of Men know, that God most High is as ready to <HI>bless</HI> 'em all as to make 'em; and to bless 'em particularly in their <HI>Marriage</HI> and <HI>Family</HI> Relation: And that as he has fill'd this World with Variety of <HI>Blessings</HI> for them, so he gives them with a Blessing, and has <HI>greater</HI> Blessings than these in Store for them, if they will know and love and fear their MAKER; even all <HI>Spiritual Blessings in Heavenly Places in</HI> CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> certainly wrote as <HI>an Historian from GOD,</HI> in telling us with what <HI>Pleasure</HI> God looked on <HI>Man,</HI> and on the inferior Creatures also, in the Day he made 'em; and how he bestow'd <HI>his Blessing</HI> on them. It belongs to a <HI>Father</HI> to bless his <HI>Offspring,</HI> from the Love he bears to 'em. And could it be possible that God should make <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> in his own <HI>Likeness,</HI> and put them together, without a solemn <HI>Benediction?</HI></P>
<P>By this <HI>Blessing</HI> God join'd them together in <HI>Holy Marriage,</HI> — And O what a <HI>Wedding</HI> was it! God gave the <HI>Bride,</HI> and bless'd the <HI>Match</HI> of his own making.— This Institution of Marriage, upon the Formation of Man <HI>male and female,</HI> is a pure and evident Token <HI>that God spake by Moses.</HI> It agrees to the whole after Current of <HI>Scripture,</HI> thro' both <HI>Testaments;</HI> to the <HI>Seventh Commandment</HI> in particu∣lar, and that <HI>every One possess himself in Sanctification and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="003887_0023_10020C5E2B4604A8"/>
To go on. By <HI>Moses</HI> Account of the first State of Man, it appears that <HI>Adam and Eve</HI> were cre∣ated with <HI>Understanding</HI> and <HI>Speech,</HI> and with the <HI>Powers of Reason in Perfection:</HI> Also with a Knowledge of the <HI>Brute Creatures</HI> necessary for <HI>their Dominion</HI> over them: And moreover, that in Things <HI>necessary</HI> for them to know, but <HI>above the Reach</HI> of Humane Understanding, they were favoured with <HI>Supernatural Revelations,</HI> or <HI>Inspiration</HI> from on High. And certainly <HI>this</HI> is as became <HI>Him</HI> whose Work is <HI>perfect,</HI> who be∣held it and lo it was all <HI>very good.</HI> It was necessary for <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> to be endowed with Knowledge and Speech, and not to have These to acquire; for then had the lower Creation been without a Head or Ruler, and the Work of God had herein been greatly defective. — <HI>Moses</HI> tells us therefore that as soon as our first Parents were created, <HI>God</HI> spake to them, and <HI>They</HI> to one another. God made Man a <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Mouth,</HI> and inspired him with a Knowledge of <HI>Himself</HI> and of his MAKER. The Man and his Wife upon the first Sight of each other had a perfect Apprehension of their <HI>Relation</HI> and mutual Obligations; and knew Themselves to be designed <HI>Parents</HI> of a numerous Posterity, to people the Earth. — They knew also, by <HI>Moses</HI> Account, all the <HI>Beasts</HI> of the Earth; had an Un∣derstanding given them of the Nature of the <HI>brute Creatures;</HI> who were therefore bro't to <HI>Adam</HI> to receive their <HI>Names</HI> from him; which was his first act of <HI>Dominion</HI> over 'em, and a wondrous Proof of their Subjection to him, and a much more won∣derful Evidence of that <HI>natural Wisdom and Saga∣city</HI> with which he was endued: That at the first Sight of any of the Creatures he could <HI>look into them,</HI> see their different Natures, and <HI>name</HI> them agreably.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="003887_0024_10020CB864E1FC70"/>
It was a mysterious Dominion that <HI>Adam</HI> enjoy∣ed, incircled by the various inferior Creatures, the Lion and the Bear together with the Sheep and Doves, to know what he wou'd call 'em. Gen. ii. 19, 20. <HI>Out of the Ground the Lord God formed every Beast of the Field, and every Fowl of the Air, and bro't them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living Creature, that was the Name thereof.</HI> Methinks the <HI>Angels</HI> ministred with Pleasure on this Occasion, &amp; heard the Man give every Creature its proper Name. Or rather as One says, <Q><HI>God</HI> by a special Instinct di∣rected 'em to come to Man as their Master and Owner. God gave him Livery and Seisin of them all, as the fair and great Estate he had en∣dowed him with, and put him in Possession of it all. The Creatures, as it were, did Homage to Him as their <HI>Sovereign.</HI></Q> And they would have remain'd <HI>obedient</HI> to him, if he had been so unto his God. But when he lost the <HI>Image</HI> of his God, the Creatures lost also their Awe and Fear of him. All this now is worthy of <HI>God,</HI> and honorary to <HI>Man</HI> in his first State.</P>
<P>See again what a mighty Knowledge <HI>Adam</HI> was inspired with on <HI>his first Sight of Eve.</HI> Read how he received Her from the Hand of God, into his own Arms. Words worthy to be written with <HI>a Pen of Gold,</HI> and graven with <HI>a Diamond</HI> on the Heart of all his Offspring. Gen. ii. 22, — 25. <HI>And the Rib which the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>had taken from Man made He a Woman, and bro't her to the Man. And Adam said, "This is now Bone of my Bone, and Flesh of my Flesh! She shall be called Woman, be∣cause she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a Man leave his Father and his Mother, and shall cleave unto his Wife; and They shall be one Flesh. And they were both naked, the Man and his Wife, and were not ashamed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="003887_0025_10020CBB29A21C90"/>
He knew her to be a <HI>Rib</HI> of Himself, his own Flesh and Blood, taken from his very <HI>Heart,</HI> as soon as he saw her. So <HI>Christ</HI> loves his <HI>Church,</HI> for out of his own <HI>Side</HI> it was formed. Who, but GOD only, could inspire <HI>Adam,</HI> in a Moment, at first Sight of <HI>Eve,</HI> to cry out,—<HI>Bone of my Bone!</HI> a Piece of my self! taken out of me, to be again Joyned with me, and be <HI>One</HI> with me for Ever! <HI>Therefore shall a Man leave his Father and Mother and cleave to his Wife!</HI> What a <HI>Prophecy</HI> was this! fulfilled thro' the Earth, however degene∣rate it is become, unto this Day! How should <HI>Adam</HI> in an Instant know any thing of being a <HI>Father &amp; Mother</HI> and of having <HI>Children!</HI> and what the <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of these Children should be, in this <HI>grand Article</HI> of Life, thro' all Genera∣tions! What a Flight and <HI>Compass</HI> of Thoughts was this! beyond the Ken of <HI>Angels,</HI> who look'd on and saw this Interview, and heard the Saluta∣tion, and understood not one half of it. — This was the <HI>first</HI> Time, that by the Mouth of <HI>Man</HI> was made known to the <HI>Angels, the manifold Was∣dom of God.</HI></P>
<P>"That <HI>Adam</HI> (says a late most Ingenious <HI>Au∣thor</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Radation Examined</HI></NOTE>) should have a perfect Idea of <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> before there was any such thing, and of the <HI>Affection</HI> and <HI>Endearment</HI> arising from that Ralation; and at the same time see clearly a <HI>Se∣cond</HI> Affection arise from the Marriage of a <HI>Stranger,</HI> and getting the <HI>better</HI> of the Ties between Parent and Child; is a <HI>Problem</HI> that must puzzel all the <HI>Infidels</HI> in the World to explain. No Penetration of the Humane Mind, nothing but express Reve∣lation from God to <HI>Adam,</HI> can account for this <HI>Prediction.</HI> — What <HI>Idea</HI>'s were here in <HI>Adam</HI>'s
<PB N="23" REF="003887_0026_10020C63B9065BB0"/>Mind before there were any <HI>Objects</HI> for them! the Idea of Parent and Child, of the paternal &amp; filial Affection, and of a Love succeeding these and surmounting them, that should be <HI>Universal</HI> thro' all the Generations of Men upon the Earth! These are Perceptions, most agreable for <HI>Adam</HI> to have on the Sight of <HI>Eve,</HI> and yet utterly impossible for him to have in any natural Way."</P>
<P>Nor is it conceivable that <HI>Moses</HI> should <HI>imagine,</HI> and feign these Tho'ts for the Head and Mouth of <HI>Adam:</HI> But if <HI>Moses</HI> wrote them from God, then all is plain and easie. The <HI>Revealer</HI> was the same both to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> and what was <HI>Prophecy</HI> in One, was <HI>History</HI> in the Other.</P>
<P>And thus we see how worthy an Account we have from <HI>Moses</HI> of the <HI>first State</HI> of Man, with respect unto that <HI>Perfection</HI> of Knowledge and Wisdom in which he was created. Nothing could be more to the Glory of the CREATOR, nor be more honour∣able to the <HI>Creature,</HI> than this Account. Certainly the Wisdom of <HI>Moses</HI> could never have gone into all the Particulars before cited, but it is GOD has spoken to Him and by him. GOD who <HI>inspired Adam</HI> to speak and act, <HI>revealed it to Moses;</HI> or it had never enter'd into his Heart.</P>
<P>I pass on to <HI>another</HI> Point, which <HI>Moses</HI> could never have tho't of, and that is the Institution of a SABBATH to Man, from the Day in which he was created; together with <HI>the Reason</HI> for God's Sanc∣tifying the <HI>seventh</HI> Part of Time. Gen. ii. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Thus the Heavens and the Earth were finished, and all the Host of them; and on the seventh Day God ended his Work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh Day from all his Work which he had made: And God blessed the Seventh Day and sanctified it;
<PB N="24" REF="003887_0027_10020CBCCFB3E9A8"/>because that in it He had rested from all his Work, which God had created and made.</HI></P>
<P>It is highly agreable to <HI>Reason,</HI> and seems to me a plain <HI>Dictate</HI> of the Religion of <HI>Nature,</HI> that <HI>some Portion of Time be statedly Holy to God,</HI> and for the Reverend <HI>Worship</HI> of Mankind, as Social Creatures<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">If God must be worshipped, there must be a <HI>Time</HI> for it. The <HI>Author</HI> of all our Time deserves a Share in it. The Affairs of <HI>this World</HI> can't claim it all; the Expectation of a <HI>better</HI> challenges a part. A Mind full of earthly Cares is unfit for Attendance on God. We may not take his Name <HI>lightly</HI> and in vain. The Time for Worship should be sta∣ted, that it may be remembred and prepar'd for. One Day in <HI>Seven</HI> can't be tho't too much for God and our Souls. His Diguity and their Value forbid us to think so—See <HI>the Religion of</HI> JESUS <HI>delineated.</HI></NOTE>. What that <HI>Part</HI> of Time is, seems to me <HI>beyond</HI> the Power of Man's Reason to determine, whether a <HI>third,</HI> a <HI>fifth,</HI> a <HI>seventh,</HI> or a <HI>tenth.</HI> God must therefore <HI>reveal</HI> his Mind to Man in this Point. And He must do it <HI>early,</HI> as <HI>Moses</HI> tells us he did, even <HI>as soon</HI> as the Creation was finished. God let <HI>our Parents</HI> know immediately, that the <HI>Seventh</HI> Part of Time should be for ever <HI>holy to Himself,</HI> and for Exercises of Worship unto <HI>Mankind,</HI> Solitary and Social, to all Generations.</P>
<P>How well did this become the <HI>Proprietor</HI> and Lord of Man, <HI>Lord of his Life and Time,</HI> and of all his <HI>Powers,</HI> of Soul and Body! How did it be∣come his own Glory, and his Creatures Duty and Happiness! that Man should render to Him a per∣petual publick <HI>Acknowledgment</HI> as his <HI>Creator,</HI> and herein enjoy a stated blessed <HI>Communion</HI> with Him! growing in his Likeness and Love all his Days upon the Earth. God's Regards to Himself and us are manifest in a <HI>Sabbath.</HI> And it is meet to be his <HI>first</HI> Ordination to his Creature Man, his <HI>first</HI> Injuncti∣on, Commandment and Law to him; that Man's
<PB N="25" REF="003887_0028_10020CBEB0CC37D0"/><HI>first Day</HI> should be <HI>a holy Sabbath</HI> unto God.—What else should it be? <HI>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to re∣ceive Glory and Honour and Power! for thou hast created all things, and for thy Pleasure they were and are created,</HI> Rev. iv. ult.</P>
<P>Surely <HI>reveal'd</HI> Religion must <HI>begin</HI> with the In∣stitution of a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and it can <HI>subsist</HI> by nothing less than the Observation of it. The Considera∣tion of <HI>this</HI> is a shining Ray on the Face of <HI>Moses.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> Thing God provided for, was to be <HI>wor∣shipped</HI> by his Creature for ever, in the most open and solemn Manner: the Salvation of his Creature depended on it, and His own Glory from him. And none but <HI>Moses</HI> ever gave the <HI>Reason</HI> why the <HI>Seventh</HI> Part of Time is sacred to the Worship of God, namely, because God had finished his Work in the Space of <HI>six</HI> Days.</P>
<P>Here is a sufficient Reason why <HI>this</HI> is the Part of Time declared to be <HI>morally Holy,</HI> and therefore to be put into the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> when given from Heaven; as <HI>Exod.</HI> xx. 11. It is a <HI>Reason</HI> becom∣ing the MAKER of Man, his Lawgiver and Judge! meet to be given to <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise, and meet to be given from <HI>Sinai</HI> to the Church.</P>
<P>The Sabbath was made <HI>for Man;</HI> as <HI>Christ</HI> has told us: Therefore as soon as <HI>Man</HI> was made the <HI>Sabbath</HI> was given to him. It is a <HI>good</HI> Day for Man, for <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body</HI> both; for our <HI>Families</HI> especially, our <HI>Sons and Daughters,</HI> our <HI>Men and Maid Servants.</HI> These therefore are <HI>named</HI> in the Commandment, and even the labouring <HI>Cattle</HI> at our Doors. <HI>Rest is good,</HI> under the Curse of Toil and Sweat which Sin has bro't upon us. But <HI>holy Work is better,</HI> the Exercise and even Labour of the Mind Heart and Affections, in Contemplation Prayer and Praise, in holy Communications, in reading preaching and hearing the Word of God. This is the <HI>true Rest</HI> of a Soul devoted to God,
<PB N="26" REF="003887_0029_10020CC0A74B72C0"/>and under the Attractions of Heaven, at the re∣turning Seasons of God's own sanctifying. See <HI>Psalms</HI> xcii. 1,—5.cxi. 1,—4.</P>
<P>Justly have the Books of <HI>Moses</HI> been always <HI>read</HI> in the worshiping Assemblies, both of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians, every Sabbath Day;</HI> He being the first Man that has written of a <HI>weekly Sabbath</HI> for Man, from the Beginning of the World unto the End of it. The number <HI>Seven</HI> seems accordingly honoured <HI>in the Course of Nature,</HI> more than any other, by the <HI>Moon</HI> in its constant Changes.</P>
<P><HI>Seven</HI> has been the <HI>Ancient</HI> and honour'd Num∣ber among the <HI>Nations</HI> of the Earth. They have measur'd their Time by <HI>Weeks</HI> from the Beginning. The Original of this was the <HI>Sabbath</HI> of God, as <HI>Moses</HI> has given the Reason of it in his Writings. No wonder then that <HI>this</HI> Number is honour'd thro' the <HI>Book of God. Noah</HI> waited <HI>Seven</HI> days, and sent out the Dove again. <HI>Balaam</HI> seems to have a superstitious Regard to this Number; <HI>"Build me</HI> seven <HI>Altars, and prepare me</HI> seven <HI>Oxen.</HI> At <HI>se∣ven</HI> Years End was the <HI>Sabbatical Year,</HI> and the <HI>Ju∣bilee</HI> to the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> at the End of seven times seven.</P>
<P><HI>Seventy Weeks</HI> (of Years) <HI>were determined upon the Holy City,</HI> in the Prophecies of <HI>Daniel,</HI> for the Coming of the <HI>Messiah, the Anointing of the most Holy.</HI> And if we look into the <HI>Revelations of John,</HI> the last Book of Scripture, the <HI>Sevens</HI> multiply upon us; the seven <HI>golden Candlesticks,</HI> seven <HI>Stars,</HI> seven <HI>Horns,</HI> seven <HI>Eyes,</HI> seven <HI>Angels,</HI> seven <HI>Spirits of God,</HI> seven <HI>Thunders,</HI> seven <HI>Vials,</HI> the seven <HI>last Plagues.</HI> There seems something very particular in the HOLY GHOST's fixing so much upon <HI>this</HI> Number: And what should be the <HI>Key</HI> to it? but the Beginning of the Writings of <HI>Moses,</HI> the first <HI>Pages</HI> in the Book of God? his finishing his glorious Work in <HI>Six</HI> Days, and con∣secrating
<PB N="27" REF="003887_0030_10020C688DCA26C0"/>the <HI>Seventh</HI> to be a Holy Sabbath to Him∣self.— The Number <HI>Seven</HI> is made Honourable to us, both in the <HI>Works</HI> of God and also in his <HI>Word.</HI> His Word agrees with his Works herein, and it is a Testimony for <HI>Moses</HI> that God spake by him.</P>
<P>It should endear and make Venerable the Name of <HI>Moses</HI> to us, that we are thus let into the <HI>Rea∣son of a Sabbath</HI> to the Church and People of God thro' all Times. It was meet that the wise and good God should <HI>fix</HI> it thus, and <HI>reveal</HI> it thus, from the Beginning. Mankind have <HI>never</HI> been with∣out a Sabbath, nor <HI>ever</HI> will be.— We thus <HI>triumph</HI> in the Sabbath day, and in <HI>Moses</HI> by whom God made it known to us. We sing <HI>the Song of Moses</HI> and celebrate our Sabbaths. We remember that <HI>the first Thing</HI> he speaks of to us from God is <HI>the Sabbath.</HI> We remember how <HI>awfully</HI> he charges us to observe and keep it. <HI>Exod.</HI> xxxi. 12, 13, 14. The Name of <HI>Moses</HI> was venerable to <HI>Nehemiah</HI> on this Account. <HI>Nehem.</HI> ix. 13, 14.</P>
<P>Let us keep the <HI>Holy Day</HI> with Joy, in Memory of the World's <HI>Nativity,</HI> in Remembrance of God our MAKER. Let us wish to keep our Sabbaths al∣ways, as our <HI>first Parents</HI> did their <HI>first Day</HI> unto God. God sanctify us on the Sabbath Day, as He has sanctified that to us. Let us every <HI>Lord's day</HI> remember the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> God's Servant. Let <HI>Moses</HI> the Servant, lead us to CHRIST, the SON, in his own House. JESUS honoured the Sabbath, and did it greater Glory than <HI>Moses. Moses</HI> wrote of it, and JESUS wrought his Miracles of Grace on it. JESUS preach'd on it, so as never Man spake. The <HI>Jewish</HI> Sabbath was <HI>buried</HI> in the Grave of JESUS; the <HI>Christian</HI> Sabbath <HI>rose</HI> with Him on the <HI>first</HI> Day of the Week. Then he <HI>rested</HI> from his more glorious Work of our Redemption, made his <HI>Visits</HI> and sent down the HOLY SPIRIT thereon. We yet sanctify the <HI>Seventh</HI> Part of Time, to the
<PB N="28" REF="003887_0031_10020CC39177DCE0"/>Honour of GOD our <HI>Maker, Redeemer &amp; Sanctifier,</HI> To the ONE GOD, <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> be Glory in the Churches of his Saints, while Sun and Moon, Day and Night endure! <Q>Glory be to the FATHER, to the SON, &amp; to the HOLY GHOST; as it was in the Beginning, is and ever shall be; World without End. Amen.</Q></P>
<P>I have insisted the more upon this <HI>great</HI> Point, (the very <HI>first</HI> by <HI>Moses</HI> Account after the Creation of <HI>Man,</HI> and of the last Importance to <HI>his</HI> Felicity and the CREATOR's Glory) because I find it wholly omitted by a <HI>most Ingenious Writer,</HI> while he selects <HI>three</HI> other Things from <HI>Moses</HI> Writings, which he well observes did require a <HI>Revelation</HI> in the State of <HI>Purity;</HI> namely, <HI>Food, Marriage</HI> and <HI>Language.</HI> But certainly the <HI>Sabbath</HI> stands as <HI>plain</HI> in <HI>Moses</HI> Account, and equally call'd for a <HI>Revelation</HI> from God; even <HI>that Part of Time</HI> which should be for ever sacred from Man, to the solemn public Wor∣ship of God. For as Man was made for <HI>Worship,</HI> and also for <HI>worldly Works,</HI> so there must be a <HI>Sab∣bath,</HI> or holy Rest, made for Man: That is to say, a <HI>Portion</HI> of Man's Time sacred to God. Of <HI>this</HI> Man's Reason and Conscience would easily tell him in his perfect State, but could not (I con∣ceive) discover what that <HI>just Proportion</HI> was, <HI>Moses</HI> lets us know that this call'd for a Revela∣tion from God to <HI>Adam,</HI> and accordingly the LORD GOD separated and blessed the <HI>seventh Day.</HI> That it <HI>must</HI> be a <HI>Seventh,</HI> and the Reason <HI>why</HI> a Se∣venth, could be known only by <HI>Revelation.</HI> And this I take to be a <HI>grand</HI> Instance and Argument of the Credibility of <HI>Moses</HI> History; that whereas <HI>some</HI> Time <HI>must</HI> be Holy to God from Man, the <HI>Proportion</HI> is given by <HI>Him,</HI> and by <HI>none</HI> before him, with the most <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>illustrious</HI> Reason of it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003887_0032_10020CC5B7AD6EE8"/>
This <HI>Proportion</HI> of Man's <HI>Time</HI> is found by Ex∣perience so convenient and sufficient, that none can be fix'd on by the Wit of Man alike sutable and fitting. And <HI>This</HI> is so <HI>great</HI> a Thing in the Histo∣ry of <HI>Moses,</HI> in the Religion of <HI>Man,</HI> and in the Worship of <HI>God,</HI> and is so <HI>plain</HI> a Thing in the sa∣cred <HI>Story,</HI> that I could by no Means <HI>omit</HI> it, nay could not but <HI>inlarge</HI> on it as a chief Strength and Beauty in the Argument before me. I wish that all Christians were duly sensible how great a Thing the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is in true Religion, according to the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of God, from the Beginning to the End of the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>only Exception</HI> to what I have advanced from this <HI>early</HI> Mention of the Institution of a <HI>Sabbath</HI> in the Writings of <HI>Moses,</HI> that I have met with, is this: <Q>That we don't find the least Hint of the <HI>Observation</HI> of a Sabbath in all the <HI>Patri∣archal State</HI> from the Days of <HI>Adam</HI> to that of <HI>Moses;</HI> and therefore it is probable that <HI>Moses</HI> mention'd it in his Account of the Work of Creation <HI>only by Way of Anticipation,</HI> after he had received the <HI>Decalogue</HI> at <HI>Sinai;</HI> where finding it given as a <HI>Reason</HI> for the <HI>fourth Com∣mandment,</HI> That in <HI>six Days</HI> the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Seas and all that in them is, and rested the <HI>seventh Day,</HI> wherefore the Lord <HI>blessed</HI> the Sabbath Day and hallowed it; he from thence took <HI>Occasion</HI> in the Beginning of his <HI>History</HI> to mention God's <HI>resting</HI> from all his Work, and blessing the <HI>Seventh Day.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If this manner of <HI>Arguing</HI> had come from the Mouth of an <HI>Infidel,</HI> I should have overlook'd the <HI>Weakness</HI> of it from his <HI>Prejudice</HI> against <HI>Revelation</HI> from God; but from the Pen of a <HI>Believer</HI> and a Christian <HI>Doctor,</HI> I can impute it to nothing but his <HI>low Esteem of the Sabbath,</HI> from an unhappy <HI>Edu∣cation</HI> in that too common <HI>Prejudice</HI> prevailing in
<PB N="30" REF="003887_0033_10020CC76394CF78"/>some <HI>Christian Schools,</HI> to the unknown Injury of true Religion and vital Piety. The <HI>Verity of Moses</HI> is indeed impeached, as well as one eminent Sig∣nature of his <HI>Inspiration</HI> from Heaven thrown up, by this lame Concession, from the <HI>Silence</HI> of <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> concerning the Observation of a Sabbath be∣fore the Flood. Whereas the whole <HI>Current of Scripture</HI> from the Days of <HI>Moses,</HI> thro' the Writ∣ings of the <HI>Prophets, Evangelists</HI> and <HI>Apostles,</HI> is strong for a <HI>Weekly Sabbath,</HI> as a most necessary and important <HI>Means</HI> of Religion in the Church of God.— <Q>Is it not then by far most probable, that the most <HI>Ancient Patriarchs</HI> did according to this early Appointment, recorded by <HI>Moses,</HI> observe it as a Day of Rest from Labour, and for the Worship of God their Creator? And that <HI>one Day in Seven,</HI> as divinely appointed, has run thro' <HI>all Dispensations,</HI> both before and after <HI>Moses,</HI> and must remain to the End of the World<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See a late Treatise, <HI>Faith and Practice,</HI> in 54. Sermons, on the Principal Heads of <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> Sermon 31,</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>The Thing next related by <HI>Moses</HI> is that a <HI>Para∣dise</HI> was prepared for our <HI>first Parents,</HI> in their State of <HI>Innocence</HI> and Rectitude. The Earth was it self indeed a Paradise, but some One of the finest and richest Spots in it was singled out for <HI>Man's</HI> first Resi∣dence &amp; Dwelling. Gen. ii. 8, 15. <HI>And the Lord God planted a Garden Eastward in Eden, and there He put the Man whom he had formed; to dress it and keep it; where He had made to grow every Tree that is pleasant to the Sight and good for Food.</HI></P>
<P>As the <HI>Sabbath</HI> had been given for the <HI>Soul,</HI> the better Part of Man, so was this <HI>Garden</HI> prepared for him as an <HI>imbodied</HI> Spirit; to gratify his <HI>Sight,
<PB N="31" REF="003887_0034_10020C6E356C3178"/>Smell, Taste</HI> and <HI>Hearing;</HI> by every <HI>Sense,</HI> and Bounty of God, to draw forth his Heart to Him, his magnificent and munificent CREATOR.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> walk'd together, contem∣plated and discoursed, eat and worship'd. The <HI>Birds</HI> sang in the Branches, the <HI>Trees</HI> were laden with painted <HI>Fruit,</HI> the <HI>Plants</HI> were covered with <HI>Flowers</HI> of the sweetest Odour, and <HI>Streams</HI> of pure Water ran by the green shady Walks. A <HI>Scene</HI> meet to typify and represent the <HI>Heavenly Felicity,</HI> which is therefore call'd by the Name of <HI>Paradise,</HI> and figur'd out to us by the <HI>Garden of God</HI> with <HI>the Tree of Life</HI> in it. Rev. xxii. Man's first State continued in, had been as like to <HI>Heaven</HI> for Hap∣piness, as could be on Earth.</P>
<P>We read of <HI>the Trees of Eden in the Garden of God:</HI> Ezek. xxxi. 9. <HI>Eden</HI> signifies <HI>Pleasure.</HI> That must needs be a Place of <HI>Delights,</HI> which is meet to be called <HI>the Garden of God.</HI> — What a <HI>Garden</HI> was this? of God's own forming and laying out? of his own settling and planting? of his own prepar∣ing for the Creature of his peculiar Delight, made in his Image and Likeness? There was doubtless a <HI>Collection</HI> of every Thing <HI>pleasant and fair for Delight,</HI> and all ranged in the most beauteous <HI>Or∣der.—Souls</HI> know no higher <HI>Comparison</HI> whereby to express their <HI>Delights</HI> in GOD their Maker, Sa∣viour and Sanctifier; nor <HI>His</HI> in Them; in and with whom He still <HI>walks</HI> as He did with <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> in <HI>Eden:</HI> Cant. iv12,—16.</P>
<P>The Scituation of the <HI>Earthly Paradise</HI> seems to me a vain Enquiry. After <HI>Sin</HI> had blasted it, it might become one of the most barren and waste Places, even before the <HI>Flood;</HI> as the Garden of <HI>Israel</HI> became after their Iniquity and Punishment was full. The <HI>Flood</HI> tore the Surface of the Earth in pieces, and the Spot where Paradise was may be now a Lake of Water, or a craggy Rock. <HI>Moses,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="003887_0035_10020CC923D10588"/>I think, only pointed to the Place where about it was, by the new and present Rivers that are since the Disruption of the Earth. We must no more think of any <HI>Paradise</HI> here below, there is no such thing to be found. If there had ever been ano∣ther, it had been in the Gardens of <HI>Solomon,</HI> but <HI>Vanity and Folly and Death</HI> soon convinc'd the <HI>Mo∣narch</HI> that no Labour or Expence of Man can re∣cover any <HI>Earthly Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed the <HI>first</HI> Paradise had been nothing, without <HI>Purity,</HI> Rectitude and <HI>Immortality</HI> in it. As soon as <HI>Sin</HI> entered, and <HI>Death</HI> by Sin, Man found no more any Paradise in <HI>Eden,</HI> but fled, hid and was driven out of it. And so 'tis as to all our Imaginary Paradises <HI>regain</HI>'d here, in a State of Sin and Death. After all the Fatigue in the Experi∣ment, or Attempt for them, we must write on 'em the Words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> which in Effect call 'em <HI>a Fools Paradise,</HI> Eccl. ii. 4,—11.</P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> without, and <HI>Wisdom</HI> within, was such in the <HI>Paradisaic</HI> State, that our Parents needed no <HI>Covering. The Man and his Wife were naked, and were not ashamed.</HI> This is admirably well said of a State of Innocence and moral Perfection. The Purity and Wisdom of God dwelt in them, and they could have nothing to blush at. This was the <HI>better,</HI> the Superior Part of Paradise; far more than all its delicious Fruits to the Eye or Palate, or than the perfum'd serene Air to their Nostrils. Their Paradise was <HI>within Themselves,</HI> and so is every wise and good Man's in the Grace of God within him. The obedient <HI>Animals</HI> about them were nothing to their own <HI>Obedience</HI> to God; His <HI>Spirit</HI> in 'em and <HI>Image</HI> on them. This made their Heart glad, their Face to shine, the Air calm, and the Fruits delicious. "By the Fall we have lost, as <HI>One</HI> well observes, the true Notion of Honour and Shame". There is nothing shameful but <HI>Sin,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="003887_0036_10020CCCD99FCC98"/>but every thing is good and great that belongs to Virtue and Sanctity. It is more than Chains to the Neck, Bracelets to the Arms, or a Crown for the Head. There is no Paradise <HI>regain'd,</HI> but in that <HI>Regeneration</HI> which CHRIST preach'd to <HI>Nico∣demus,</HI> and which his Gospel produces in his Elect and Sanctified. We must be <HI>created</HI> anew <HI>after God,</HI> in Righteousness and true Holiness, and be made <HI>New Creatures.</HI> This is the <HI>Shadow</HI> of the Paradise past, and the <HI>Earnest</HI> of that to come.</P>
<P>Let our Meditation of the <HI>One</HI> end in nothing short of the <HI>Other.</HI> The <HI>Bible</HI> begins there and ends here. <HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. Surely it is as the <HI>Revela∣tion</HI> of God should begin and end. God meant Man <HI>two Paradises,</HI> the one in the Way to the o∣ther. By <HI>Adam</HI>'s losing the first, the other also is lost to most of his miserable Children. If the <HI>first</HI> Paradise had been kept, dress'd and improved, we had not fail'd of the <HI>second.</HI> But O the <HI>Shame</HI> and Misery to Mankind, when we reflect — how <HI>soon</HI> the Enjoyments of a <HI>Paradise</HI> were all forfeit∣ed and lost! all vilely thrown away as a Thing of nought!</P>
<P>How ungrateful to God, and unnatural to Them∣selves, was <HI>this Sin</HI> of our first Parents! We are driven from the Joys of Paradise, into the sorrow∣ful Consideration of the Crime and Guilt of <HI>Man's Apostacy.</HI> From a <HI>Garden</HI> of highest Peace and Pleasure, we pass into an <HI>Hospital</HI> of Diseases, Sores, Pains, Anguishes both of Soul and Body! into the Agonies of <HI>Death,</HI> the Putrefaction of the <HI>Grave,</HI> and the Torments of <HI>Hell</HI> for Evermore.</P>
<P>O dismal <HI>Change</HI> of State and Place! from the Paradise of GOD, to the Pit of <HI>Devils.</HI> Legions of <HI>Angels</HI> had fell from the Heights of Heavenly Glory before this; had <HI>left their first State,</HI> and were <HI>cast down into Hell.</HI> They are <HI>in Chains of Darkness reserved unto Judgment,</HI> a Pet. ii. 4. Jude
<PB N="34" REF="003887_0037_10020CCE739988A0"/>v. 6. <HI>Lucifer,</HI> (the <HI>Prince</HI> of these fallen Angels, <HI>the Devil and Satan,</HI> that Son of <HI>Pride</HI> and Malice) could not bear to see <HI>a Spirit in Flesh</HI> in the Image and Favour of God, in a <HI>Paradise</HI> on Earth, while <HI>he</HI> was sunk down to Hell, accursed. He there∣fore in Spite to <HI>God</HI> and to his happy Creature <HI>Man,</HI> in his accursed Hatred of the <HI>Image</HI> of God in <HI>One</HI> so much his Inferior in the Order of Crea∣tures, meditated (and alas accomplish'd) Man's <HI>Loss</HI> of his Original Holiness, his <HI>Ejection</HI> from his earthly Paradise, his <HI>Forfeiture</HI> of the Heavenly, and <HI>Condemnation</HI> after him to a Hell of everlast∣ing Burnings. And now let us see <HI>by what Means</HI> he effected this his devilish Design.</P>
<P>Only the Writings of <HI>Moses</HI> let us into the <HI>Ori∣ginal of Evil.</HI> That GOD is good, and that He must needs make all things <HI>good,</HI> and Man so in a singular manner, is agreed on all Hands. But <HI>whence</HI> then should <HI>Evil</HI> come? This is a <HI>Difficulty</HI> that has puzzled all Men, who have not seen or us'd the Key of <HI>Scripture.</HI> That only opens to us <HI>the Gates of the Shadow of Death,</HI> and shows us the Goodness and Holiness of God, without the least Imputation from all the Misery and Ruin, that Man by the Instigation of the Devil has bro't upon himself.</P>
<P>The greatest Wonder is, how <HI>Sin</HI> could enter into any of the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, in their Superior State of Knowledge and Wisdom, Goodness and Holiness. And the <HI>Guesses</HI> of learned &amp; pious Men are very vain, I fear, in this Point, if they venture further than the SPIRIT OF GOD has led 'em, in the few <HI>Hints</HI> given of this tremendous Matter in the <HI>written Word.</HI> There we read of <HI>the Condemna∣tion of the Devil,</HI> that it was for <HI>Pride:</HI> 1 Tim. iii. 6. The most probable Account that can be of the <HI>Sin of Angels:</HI> that there was some <HI>Discontent, Emu∣lation</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="003887_0038_10020C734019E8D0"/>or <HI>Envying</HI> among them, or some <HI>Aspiring</HI> to be as the MOST HIGH; to which Sin he prompted our Parents also, and prevailed.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>Original</HI> of Sin and Misery; pro∣bably long before our Earth was created and Man upon it. And when <HI>Angels</HI> saw the Delights of God <HI>in the Sons of Men</HI> and shouted for Joy, the <HI>Devils</HI> were filled with Madness and Vexation at it, and set themselves to destroy this pleasing Workmanship of God.</P>
<P>We are greatly obliged to <HI>Moses,</HI> in the Hand of GOD, for this Discovery to us of the <HI>Cause</HI> the Way and Means of our Ruin. We are deliver'd from the vain and <HI>absurd</HI> Imagination which others have gone into of an <HI>Evil God,</HI> as well as a <HI>Good</HI> One. A most <HI>impious</HI> Principle, and pleasing eno' to the <HI>Devil;</HI> to make a <HI>God</HI> of him, and give him a Throne like the <HI>Most High.</HI> A very grateful Return to Him for all the Mischief he has done us!</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> went into this ridiculous Notion, which was the Reason of the Prophet's Words to <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the Anointed while yet unborn, in the Name of the LORD: Isai. xlv. 5, 6, 7. <HI>I am the</HI> LORD, <HI>and there is none else, there is none beside Me; I girded thee, tho' thou hast not known Me: That they may know from the Rising of the Sun and from the West, that there is none beside Me: I am the</HI> LORD <HI>and there is none else: I form the Light and create Darkness, I make Peace &amp; create Evil; I the</HI> LORD <HI>do all these things.</HI> You may be ready to think, this would mislead the People of <HI>Cyrus</HI> into an ill Tho't of the <HI>Good God,</HI> as if he were the <HI>Author of Evil.</HI> But the plain Meaning is, that there can∣not possibly be <HI>two Gods,</HI> the one good and the o∣ther evil; Opposites and Rivals to each Other; and that such an Imagination ought never to have enter'd into their foolish blinded Hearts. For GOD is necessarily <HI>One only,</HI> and <HI>most Good;</HI> and
<PB N="36" REF="003887_0039_10020CD07585D010"/>at first made all Things good, and forbad Evil to the uttermost. But intelligent Creatures sinn'd a∣gainst their own Light, abus'd their Freedom, and bro't the Evil upon Themselves. And now <HI>this Evil</HI> is under the wise and righteous Government of the <HI>Good God,</HI> is the Punishment of a wicked World, and over ruled by God to the most wise, good and holy Ends. Therefore there is but <HI>One Providence</HI> and Dominion over all, which is alto∣gether good and perfect, and in the Hand of the <HI>GOD of Israel,</HI> the one living and true God.</P>
<P>Into all this Train of Truth and Religion to the <HI>One Eternal supream</HI> GOD, <HI>Moses</HI> leads us by his Account of the <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil; telling us how God made Man very good and happy, and how soon he made himself sinful and miserable.</P>
<P>But the Wonder then must be about the <HI>Way</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of Man's bringing himself under Sin and Misery. And <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>Particular</HI> which <HI>Moses</HI> (under the Inspiration of God) has revealed to us. A Matter of the <HI>last</HI> Importance to the Honour of God, and for our Recovery to Him. And when we have considered <HI>Moses</HI> his Account, we cannot conceive of any other, or like Way, for the <HI>Original</HI> of all the Evils, of Body and Soul, that we find our Selves under, from our Birth into the World, to our going out of it.</P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> therefore lets us know, in the <HI>first</HI> place; That God having made Man's <HI>Body</HI> to subsist and live <HI>by Food,</HI> growing out of the Earth; He im∣mediately gave <HI>Direction</HI> to Man about his proper <HI>Food.</HI> Gen. i. 29. <HI>And God said, Behold, I have given you every Herb bearing Seed, which is upon the Face of all the Earth; and every Tree yielding Fruit; to you it shall be for Meat. Moses</HI> goes on in the next <HI>Chapter</HI> and tells us, <Q>That the LORD GOD having planted the Garden in <HI>Eden</HI> for his Crea∣ture
<PB N="37" REF="003887_0040_10020CD24438B040"/><HI>Man,</HI> He fill'd it <HI>with every Tree pleasant to the Eye and good for Food;</HI> and <HI>in the Midst of the Garden he plac'd the Tree of Life,</HI> and also <HI>a Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil:</HI> And that <HI>the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>commanded the Man, saying, Of every Tree of the Garden thou mayest freely eat, out of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the Day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now what could be more <HI>good</HI> than all this? con∣sulting the Honour of God and Man's Happiness, in God's Government and Man's Obedience! and other Way for <HI>Either</HI> there could be none. What could <HI>the wise and holy</HI> ONE do more, or what less, to <HI>prevent</HI> the very Being and Knowledge of Evil? He forbid it on Pain of Death, he told our Parents the certain Consequent of their Disobedience to Him, in <HI>this</HI> or any other Particular; that it would be ALL EVIL to them, Death and Damnation to Body and Soul.</P>
<P>It was in the Power and Will of Man now to have obey'd and continued happy; but to be sure you would have tho't that he could never dare to offend in this particular Point, by <HI>Eating of the forbidden Tree,</HI> which carried <HI>the Knowledge of Evil</HI> in its Name. But God saw Man's Danger was here, in his <HI>Appetite,</HI> which it was fit to restrain and direct as to every thing that would be <HI>hurtful</HI> to the Life of the Body, and therein also to the Powers of the Soul; and whatsoever was not so, Man might be sure his bountiful <HI>Maker</HI> would not prohibit to him.</P>
<P>It seems very reasonable to think, That Man in the Perfection of his Understanding needed the <HI>Direction</HI> of God, as <HI>Moses</HI> tells us he had it, in respect of his proper <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d.</HI> He was not created with a natural <HI>Instinct</HI> like the brute Creatures, which is to them a more <HI>infallible</HI> Direction than
<PB N="38" REF="003887_0041_10020C76B6CA90C8"/><HI>Reason</HI> could be in the matter of Food. The Crea∣tures were made to be govern'd only by <HI>Sense,</HI> and a Sense they have very <HI>perfect</HI> what to eat &amp; drink, and what not; even as if they knew and could say to themselves, <Q>This is good for me, and that would do me hurt; I chuse this therefore as I shun that.</Q>—<HI>Reason</HI> in Man was not prima∣rily intended for these inferior Things, and there∣fore was never meant to serve as <HI>Instinct</HI> does in the brute Kind the Purposes of <HI>Universal Sense and Antipathy,</HI> which is necessary to their Preser∣vation. <HI>Reason</HI> being given us for <HI>higher</HI> Uses, Man seems to need a <HI>Revelation</HI> from God about his <HI>inferior</HI> Good, his <HI>Food.</HI> It is by Observation and <HI>Experience</HI> that Mankind get the Knowledge of Things noxious to Them, among the Herbs or Fruits of the Earth. And there being, let us sup∣pose, <HI>one</HI> Tree in the Midst of the Garden of a <HI>poisonous</HI> Nature to the Humane Body, God <HI>forbad</HI> it to Man, and made it the <HI>Trial</HI> of his Obedience; assuring him it would be <HI>deadly</HI> to him if he eat of it.</P>
<P>I own, that it is not necessary for us to suppose this <HI>Poison</HI> in the forbidden Tree. It is eno' that God forbad it, were it never so good in it self. <Q>It was certainly intended <HI>to prove our first Pa∣rents</HI> whether they would continue good, or lapse into known Evil.</Q> They knew it would be <HI>good</HI> in them to abstain and obey, and would cer∣tainly be very <HI>evil</HI> in them, and bring Evil on 'em to disobey and eat. They could not think that God would have denied 'em this Tree, if it were not Evil for them in it self, for any other End but the <HI>Trial</HI> of their Obedience, whether they would continue good.— Yet on the other Hand, there might be (for ought we know) a <HI>natural Evil</HI> to the Body of Man in this forbidden Tree. As we are told by <HI>Bishop Patrick</HI> that many of the <HI>Fa∣thers</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="003887_0042_10020CD502C5E660"/>suppos'd there <Q>was a Virtue in the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> to preserve and maintain the Animal Spi∣rits, and the bodily Organs, in that equal Tem∣per and State in which they were created.—</Q> But as to <HI>This</HI> we may think differently, and yet not differ upon it. It comes to the same Thing, if with other <HI>Divines</HI> we judge the Tree of Life to have been only <Q>a <HI>Sign and Seal</HI> of the Conti∣nuance of Life and Happiness to <HI>Adam,</HI> even unto Immortality and everlasting Blessedness, thro' the Grace and Favour of his Maker, up∣on Condition of his Perseverance in his State of Innocence and Obedience.</Q> In like manner the <HI>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</HI> was at least this, "A Sign and warning to <HI>Adam</HI> of the <HI>Loss</HI> of Life and Happiness, and of the sad <HI>Expe∣riment</HI> of Evil in Soul and Body; and as such it was forbidden him. — So that here were <HI>Life and Death,</HI> Blessing and Cursing, set before our first Parents, as in <HI>two Sacramental Signs &amp; Seals</HI> annex∣ed to the Covenant of Works.</P>
<P>In short, <HI>Moses</HI> lets us know that Man's <HI>Depra∣vation</HI> both in Soul and Body was from his <HI>Sinning</HI> against God, and that the Sin of Man was his in∣dulging an <Q><HI>irregular Appetite,</HI> in an Instance positively forbidden him, with a most plain Threatning of the mortal Effects of it<NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Revelation Examined,</HI> Dissert. I.</NOTE></Q> He tells us also the <HI>Temptation</HI> Man was under to com∣mit the Sin, namely, to attain <HI>a higher Degree of Knowledge</HI> than he was made in. God had made him very <HI>knowing</HI> and happy in all Respects, and he ought to have been not only <HI>contented</HI> with, but very <HI>thankful</HI> for his Endowments and Enjoyments both intellectual and sensitive. God had made him to use his Knowledge, and to govern his Ap∣petites,
<PB N="40" REF="003887_0043_10020CD765857FD0"/>in a reverential Obedience to Him his LORD. To disobey was necessarily to defile him∣self both as to Soul and Body, and that <HI>presump∣tnously</HI> in Defiance to the Warning given him of the fatal Effect on both, Death bodily and spiri∣tual. Here was a Complication of Infidelity, In∣gratitude, Discontent, Prophaness, Sensuality, Pride and Arrogance, with unnatural Cruelty a∣gainst his own Life, and that of his Offspring.</P>
<P>This Account of the <HI>Original</HI> of Sin and Misery wonderfully agrees with the Progress and <HI>Propaga∣tion</HI> of it from Age to Age. As one excellently observes and argues, <Q>We see it still in our Selves to be the Establishment of God, in the Nature and Constitution of Things, that all irregular Indulgence of bodily Appetite, of one Kind or other, is atttended with Evil: And so also every inordinate Affection and Passion of Soul, and in particular all vain Pursuits of superiour Wisdom, Affectation and Pride of Knowledge, naturally tend to impair the Powers of the Mind and make it vain. And as this is matter of Fact, so what can be more worthy of the Wisdom, Goodness and Perfection of God's Government, than that the Abuse of Reason should impair the Powers of it, and Indulgence of Appetite make it more irregular.</Q> And if every Disor∣der of Mind and Flesh in Man is still attended with Evil, how agreable to Reason must this Ac∣count of <HI>the Original of Evil</HI> be, which <HI>Moses</HI> gives us; soil, That God acquainted <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> as soon as he had made 'em, with <HI>this</HI> certain and invariable Constitution of Humane Nature; and therefore vehemently prohibited every inordi∣nate Desire and Appetite, because of the <HI>Evil</HI> that would onsue upon it, to Themselves first and also to their Posterity after them; which in the Course
<PB N="41" REF="003887_0044_10020C78E1C68F88"/>of Nature is unavoidable, <Q>The Infections of Parents affecting their <HI>Children</HI> while yet in their <HI>Loins.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And this again was a very great <HI>Aggravation</HI> of the first Transgression, that it must be in the Course of Nature the Inlet and <HI>Entail</HI> of Sin and Misery upon the Offspring. If the first Parents corrupted themselves, their Issue must come depraved into the World both in Soul and Body: <HI>For who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? That which is born of the Flesh is Flesh.</HI> People that are vici∣ous and lustful corrupt their own Seed, more or less by their Indulgences, and often entail Diseases, Dolours and evil Inclinations upon their Offspring; which is one Way of God's <HI>visiting the Iniquity of Parents on their Children to the third and fourth Ge∣neration.</HI> — And that the first Corruption of Man∣kind should be by their first Parents eating of a Fruit forbidden to them, because Evil for them to eat of, by a good God, can't seem at all strange to us who know that there are several sorts of Fruits growing at this Day about us, the eating whereof would poison our Bodies and be deadly to us, some presently, some more leisurely. And those that do in the most slow manner affect the bodily Life, do at the same Periods of Time and in the same Degrees affect the Soul and hurt the Powers of the Mind. The <HI>Experiment</HI> and Knowledge of Evil comes on Mankind after this Manner unto this Day. No wonder then if it first came in at this Door. Nay it may be we should find, if we could but attain a <HI>perfect</HI> Knowledge of the Effects of e∣very forbidden Indulgence of bodily Appetite, and the Passions of our Souls, that there is not the <HI>least</HI> of either Kind we can be guilty of, but it does in some Degree impair the Health and Life of the Body, as well as the Virtue and Purity of the Soul. Our Soul and Body in their present
<PB N="42" REF="003887_0045_10020CD945790040"/>Union suffer together, by every Intemperance and Lusting of Flesh or Spirit, bring on their own Dis∣solution, and treasure up Evil against the World to come; where God has told us we must suffer in both, if Sin is died in; if it is not repented of, subdued and forsaken here in the Body: Which is the only way to recover something of a <HI>Para∣disaic</HI> State for Souls here, and of Life everlasting for Soul and Body hereafter.</P>
<P>Let the Wit of Man show if it can a more <HI>eredible,</HI> a like <HI>natural</HI> Account of the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Propagation</HI> of Sin and Misery. And if the <HI>Free∣thinkers,</HI> the <HI>Deists</HI> and <HI>Unbelievers</HI> of the present Age cannot give us a more likely Account; more worthy of a wise and good God, and more agre∣able to the Nature of Man; let them receive Con∣viction and confess that GOD was in <HI>Moses</HI> of a Truth, or at least let them cease their Cavilling and Snarling at the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> and from blasphem∣ing the Writings of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>For my own part, If I know what <HI>free thinking</HI> is in this our degenerate State, wherein we find the Powers of Mind and Body infeebled and depraved to a great Degree; If I know what it is to reason clearly and impartially, it is on the Side of <HI>Moses,</HI> and by Faith given to what he has written as a Revelation from God unto us. But it is no great wonder to see the <HI>Men of Licence</HI> and vicious Life at Defiance to the Writings of <HI>Moses,</HI> which would convince them of Sin and lead 'em to the <HI>Original</HI> of it, and thereby condemn to Death all their lov'd criminal Indulgences both of Flesh and Spirit. For if they own <HI>Moses</HI> his Account to be true, <HI>Death</HI> must be for ever staring 'em in the Face in all the Excesses of their bodily Appetites, in all their in∣ordinate Passions, and more especially in their dar∣ling imperious <HI>Assuming of Knowledge</HI> to them∣selves,
<PB N="43" REF="003887_0046_10020C7DE65EE428"/>as if none had tasted of that <HI>Tree</HI> beside 'em, but they were <HI>the Gods knowing Good &amp; Evil.</HI></P>
<P>And it is too true that this is their Guilt and Aspiration, in Similitude of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Transgression, while they ridicule the Imputation of it and the Derivation of it. So has the <HI>Serpent beguiled 'em thro' his Subtlety,</HI> and like their first Parents they transgress daily, but do not <HI>see themselves naked.</HI> While they laugh at the Account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, and banter <HI>Moses</HI> for it, they are but <HI>feeding on the Tree of Death without Fear.</HI></P>
<P>I say again, The <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil had remain'd <HI>unknown</HI> to us to this Day, if God had not <HI>reveal'd</HI> it to us in his Word. <HI>The World by Wisdom</HI> could not know it. Neither the <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Schools could imagine which way Mankind had become so vicious, foolish and miserable. The most pro∣bable Solution of the Matter was the Opinion of a <HI>pre-existent State</HI> wherein Souls had sinned, and were sent into these Bodies as into <HI>Prisons</HI> in Way of Punishment. Others went into the before na∣med ridiculous Notion of <HI>two opposite and contrary Principles or Causes,</HI> the One of all the <HI>Good</HI> in the World, the other of all the <HI>Evil</HI> in it. What Confusion was there in this Imagination of an <HI>Evil God?</HI> how <HI>were their foolish Hearts darkned?</HI> What a Mercy is it to be delivered out of this Maze and Labyrinth of Evil! Truth is easie, but Error is endless. How <HI>plain</HI> is the Matter now <HI>Moses</HI> has told it to us? in the <HI>Quest</HI> whereof we should have wandered in vain without his <HI>Clue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Evil</HI> is from the Creature and not from God. Far be it from the ALMIGHTY <HI>who cannot be tempted with Evil, neither tempteth he any Man.</HI> Angels and Men were <HI>drawn away of their own Lust and enticed.</HI> God inclined both the One and Other strongly to Good, commanded it, and forbad the
<PB N="44" REF="003887_0047_10020CDB67857268"/>Knowledge of Evil. <HI>Angels</HI> were high in the Creation of God, but aspiring to be higher they fell by <HI>Pride.</HI> Fallen they swell'd with Rage and Envy and Hatred of God, and of every happy Being, the Objects of his Love and Favour. <HI>Man</HI> being of this blessed Number, the Prince of Devils had him in his spiteful Eye, and presently devised Means how to spoil <HI>God</HI> of his Glory from Man, and <HI>Man</HI> of his Blessedness in the Favour of God. He knew there was but <HI>one Way</HI> in which to com∣pass this dire Event, and that was to entice Man into <HI>Sin, the abominable Thing which God hates.</HI> To compass this he considered the Nature of Man both as to Soul and Body, the Appetite of the one to <HI>Food,</HI> and the Thirst of the other after <HI>Knowledge:</HI> And there being in the Garden one Tree of good∣ly Fruit to look on forbidden to the Man, he pro∣posed if he could by any Means to bring him to <HI>lust</HI> after it and eat of it, and he fix'd on that by which he and his Angels had fallen; scil, <HI>Discon∣tent</HI> in his State, and by aspiring after more <HI>Know∣ledge;</HI> a Temptation to <HI>which</HI> he would draw from the very <HI>Name</HI> of the forbidden Tree, <HI>the Tree of Knowledge;</HI> a Tree (he would feign) to be desir∣ed for an <HI>Increase</HI> of Knowledge and Wisdom.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Way,</HI> as <HI>Moses</HI> tells us, Man was seduced, thro' the Subtlety of <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>Prince of Devils,</HI> to disobey God, and bring Ruine on Himself and on his Posterity, both as to Soul and Body. And what can be more probable than <HI>such</HI> a Way and Inlet to all the <HI>Evil</HI> we find our Selves subject to here in this Life, and to <HI>Death</HI> the End of it? What but <HI>Disobedience</HI> to God our Maker, and <HI>Re∣bellion</HI> against his <HI>Will</HI> made known to us for our Good? even for our Preservation in Holiness and Happiness. What can be more honorary and <HI>glo∣rious to God</HI> than this Account of the Original of Evil? and what more <HI>like our Selves,</HI> our own
<PB N="45" REF="003887_0048_10020CDDA0482130"/>Consciences being Witnesses? For to be sure we find our Selves fallen into Sin, and most prone to it by Nature from our Birth; and what more like∣ly Account can there be of our coming into such a State, than by the Instigation of some <HI>Devil</HI> or other, in such an Instance as <HI>Moses</HI> has related? Nor can we wonder at the <HI>Consequence</HI> of so much Evil, bodily and spiritual; upon the Supposition of such <HI>Sin</HI> and Transgression.</P>
<P>Let us therefore seriously peruse and weigh the whole <HI>Process</HI> of the Temptation and Seduction of our first Parents, as it is given by <HI>Moses,</HI> and see if it be not the most likely, and only probable Account of the <HI>Origine</HI> of Evil that has been offered.</P>
<P>That <HI>Evil</HI> could not come from the <HI>Good</HI> GOD, as His Act, Will or Pleasure, is most certain: The Nature of God must abhor from it, and so does <HI>Moses</HI> his Account.— That <HI>Evil</HI> is of two Sorts is evident, <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>penal;</HI> the Evil of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Pu∣nishment</HI> for Sin: <HI>Moses</HI> reveals it, and we are conscious to it within our Selves; we have <HI>Sense</HI> of Sorrow and Pain, and we have the <HI>Conscience</HI> of Sin.— That bodily and Soul <HI>Sorrows</HI> or Suffer∣ings, and that Dissolution of Soul and Body which they work, should be the <HI>Fruit</HI> of our Sinning a∣gainst God, is the most easy, natural and only rea∣sonable and worthy Account of the Matter, that the Wit of Man can give.— That <HI>Evils</HI> beset us from the Womb, and pursue us thro' all our Life here in the Flesh, wear out our Bodies and Spirits, and bring down our green or gray Heads to the Grave, is a thing not to be denied. — That <HI>these</HI> are under the Providence and <HI>Government</HI> of a most wise, good and holy GOD, is as certain as the very Being of One.—That they must come upon us for Correction and Judgment, and in a Way of <HI>Pu∣nishment,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="003887_0049_10020C83CEDF5F80"/>is sensible to Flesh and Blood, and evi∣dent to Reason: We groan, weep, cry out and beg for Mercy, Compassion and Respite, under our bodily Maladies &amp; Pressures. — What GOD should punish us for, but for <HI>Sin</HI> against Him, some cri∣minal Disorder of our Appetites and Affections, in Contradiction to the Law of our Nature, his Will made known to us for our Good and his Glory from us, is not to be imagined. — That this Sin is <HI>of our Selves,</HI> or by the Instigation of <HI>some evil Be∣ing</HI> who had himself fallen from God, is as evi∣dent to our Understandings as that God is good, and can be the Author only of what is good, pure and perfect.— That this good God should do all that is fit and proper to <HI>prevent</HI> his happy Creature from falling into Evil, is every way agreable to our Reason, as <HI>Moses</HI> has told us that he did. — That He should hainously <HI>resent</HI> his Creatures pre∣sumptuous Sinning, is most agreable to all our Ideas of his Wisdom, Holiness, Dominion and Govern∣ment.— That He is very <HI>just</HI> and righteous in the Infliction of Evil upon the Sinner, is as undenia∣ble as his necessary Relation to us of a Law∣giver and a Judge. — The only Doubt or <HI>Question</HI> then is, Whether <HI>Moses his Account of Adam's Sin,</HI> by a criminal Indulgence of his Appetite, in a par∣ticular forbidden Instance, at the Sollicitation of a fallen Angel, that was before become an Enemy to GOD and Goodness; be not a very rational Account of the Introduction of Evil, into this Part of the Creation of God which we inhabit? — If the <HI>Infidels,</HI> who are ready to ridicule <HI>Moses</HI> his Account, can give a better, let them do it: But this they do not attempt.— Yet they say that the Account of <HI>Moses</HI> is incredible, because of the Agency of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> his Part in seducing <HI>Eve,</HI> and God's Curse upon <HI>him</HI> for it.—But let us deli∣berately read over, and examine, what <HI>Moses</HI> has
<PB N="47" REF="003887_0050_10020CB2C84A6BD8"/>written of this Matter, in the <HI>third Chapter of Genesis;</HI> and if we cannot vindicate it as worthy of the blessed GOD, and the most likely Way of <HI>Man's</HI> first Sin and the Evil consequent thereon, then let 'em mock on.— Or I would rather say, Altho' we cannot answer for every Difficulty in the Account given of Man's Fall, yet we may see Eno' in it of GOD, his Wisdom, Goodness, Holiness and Justice, <HI>to still the Enemy and the Avenger,</HI> and to fill us with Admiration of and Thankfulness for the Writings of <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>The Matter then lies thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There was a <HI>Tree of Evil</HI> in the Garden where <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were plac'd by God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Nature</HI> of this Tree was such, or the <HI>Constitution of God</HI> respecting it was such, that if Man eat of it 'twould bring <HI>Evil</HI> on him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. God immediately <HI>inform'd</HI> our first Pa∣rents hereof, and positively <HI>forbad</HI> 'em to eat of it, because of the <HI>Evil</HI> it would bring upon them if they dar'd to touch it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He therefore call'd it in their Hearing by the <HI>Name</HI> of the Tree of Know∣ledge of Good and Evil; which was to say, where∣by they would <HI>experience</HI> within themselves what <HI>Evil</HI> is, and how it differs from the <HI>Good</HI> which they were in the full Enjoyment of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He let them know therefore, that this Tree was placed there for the <HI>Trial of their Obedience;</HI> whether in the midst of all the other Fruits of <HI>Paradise,</HI> of all which they might freely and safely eat, they would regard his Will and Pleasure in this <HI>one</HI> Prohibition, which was also for their Preservation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He therefore also set <HI>a Tree of Life</HI> in the Midst of the Garden, as a Sacramental Sign or natural Means of <HI>Immortality,</HI> for him to eat of; while the Tree forbidden to him would only bring certain <HI>Death</HI> on him. — Upon all we must remember the <HI>Perfection of Understanding</HI> wherein our first Parents
<PB N="48" REF="003887_0051_10020CDFD9582CA8"/>were created; that they perfectly understood the Mind and Will of God in all this Prohibition, with the Reason and Equity of their Re∣straint in this Particular, which plainly appears from <HI>Eve's</HI> Answer to the Serpent, Gen. iii. 2, 3, <HI>And the Woman said to the Serpent, We may cat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden; but of that Tree which is in the Midst of the Garden God hath said, "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it lest ye die.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And now
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Let us suppose with <HI>Moses</HI> a World of accursed <HI>fallen Spirits,</HI> with <HI>Satan</HI> at their Head, who in their Pride and Rebellion against God had left their first Seat, and were full of <HI>En∣mity</HI> to God, <HI>full of all subtlety and Mischief, Ene∣mies of all Righteousness,</HI> as contrary to God and all Goodness as <HI>Darkness</HI> is to Light.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. We may reasonably grant that these wicked diabolical Spi∣rits, in their Spite against God, and Enmity to his Image in Man, and Envy of his Delight in him, would <HI>desire to seduce Mankind</HI> into Sin and Misery after themselves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. There is nothing in Reason and Justice to forbid God's <HI>permitting the Tempter</HI> to <HI>try</HI> the Obedience of his happy Creature, endu∣ed with Knowledge, Holiness and Strength for yielding him a constant and resolute Obedience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. It is not unlikely, that God having placed <HI>a Tree</HI> in the Garden which he had forbidden Man to touch, the Tempter would fix on that particu∣lar <HI>Test,</HI> and try if he could not prevail over our Parents in this matter of <HI>bodily Appetite.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Fix∣ing on <HI>this</HI> Way of Temptation, he lays his Train on what <HI>Motive</HI> to induce Man to transgress.</ITEM>
</LIST>
And
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Remembring well how he fell himself by <HI>Pride,</HI> aspiring after a <HI>higher</HI> State in the Creation than that God had given him, he naturally tho't <HI>this</HI> as likely a Way whereby to prevail over Man, a

<ITEM>2. If therefore he can prevail on <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Eve</HI> to lust after <HI>greater Knowledge</HI> and Wisdom, he knew that they would fall after him, into his own Condemnation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To compass this he re∣solves to improve the <HI>Name</HI> of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and to recommend the Tree to Man <HI>as a Tree to be desired to make them wiser</HI> than God had made 'em; yea to make 'em <HI>as Gods,</HI> as Angels, like GOD Himself, for Understanding and Wisdom.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To this End he craftily proposed to enter into some <HI>brute Creature,</HI> or to assume the Form of one, and watching an Opportunity he would in the Sight of <HI>Eve</HI> or <HI>Adam,</HI> or both, <HI>eat</HI> of the Fruit of the forbidden Tree, and then <HI>speak</HI> to them with a <HI>Man's Voice,</HI> and with the <HI>Reason</HI> and Understanding of a Man; to let 'em see with their <HI>Eyes,</HI> and hear with their <HI>Ears,</HI> the Power and <HI>Virtue</HI> of that Fruit, to <HI>change</HI> a brute Crea∣ture into <HI>Rational;</HI> and from thence to perswade 'em that if <HI>they</HI> would eat of the same Fruit <HI>their Souls</HI> would by a Parity of Reason be raifed into <HI>Angels.</HI></ITEM>

<P>This seems evidently to be the <HI>Scheme</HI> which the <HI>Devil</HI> laid, according to <HI>Moses</HI> Account; and a more <HI>subtle</HI> one could not be laid: It was <HI>a Depth of Satan.</HI> In Pursuance of it,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He consider'd <HI>which</HI> among the brute Creatures had the most na∣tural <HI>Subtlety</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> and might therefore be the most <HI>taking</HI> in Man's Eye: And pitch'd upon the <HI>Serpent;</HI> which did not go upon its <HI>Belly,</HI> or crawl in the <HI>Dust</HI> and feed on it as after the Curse; but was as much more beauteous and <HI>charming</HI> a Creature to the Eye of Man, as it is now <HI>base,</HI> ab∣ject and hateful.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He watch'd his Opportunity to find <HI>Eve alone,</HI> near to the forbidden Tree, to speak to her as out of the Mouth of the Serpent.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="50" REF="003887_0053_10020C868164C020"/>
3. We may will suppose <HI>she</HI> was exceedingly <HI>sur∣prised</HI> to hear a brute and dumb Creature speak with humane Voice and Understanding, and that she might be ready to <HI>express</HI> her Surprise thereat. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. We may as reasonably suppose that the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Serpent's Form, like <HI>himself,</HI> a false and <HI>lying Spirit,</HI> told her that he came by his <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> and Understanding, and by the Power of <HI>Speech,</HI> by hapning to <HI>eat</HI> of the excellent Fruit of <HI>that Tree:</HI> That whereas till now he had been indeed a <HI>brute</HI> Creature and destitute of Know∣ledge, immediately his Eyes were open, and a <HI>Man's</HI> Heart was given him, and this Light and Understanding came into him, which she now saw and heard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. We may well imagine that the pretended <HI>Serpent</HI> told her this with a great Appea∣rance of Joy and <HI>Transport,</HI> as one must needs have that was at once <HI>transform'd</HI> from the Spirit of a Beast to that of a humane Intelligence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. We may as well think that hereupon <HI>Eve</HI> spake her Admiration of this <HI>Event,</HI> and let the Serpent know how that God had <HI>forbidden</HI> them to taste of this Tree; which she could not but the more muse upon and <HI>wonder</HI> at, upon what she now saw and heard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. To which the <HI>Serpent</HI> also answers with a Shew of Wonder, and asks (as <HI>Moses</HI> tells us) <HI>"Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat of every Tree in the Garden?</HI> q. d. <HI>Can</HI> it be so? and <HI>what</HI> can this mean? can the good God lay any such <HI>Re∣straint</HI> upon you? and forbid you <HI>this</HI> Tree in parti∣cular?</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. <HI>Eve</HI> naturally, and truly replied, Yes, <HI>We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden, but of this Tree God hath said, "Ye shall not eat of it; neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It is plain there had been some <HI>previous Confe∣rence</HI> between the <HI>Serpent</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> before the Ser∣pent's Words, <HI>"Yea, hath God said, ye shall not eat?</HI> It seems to be a Return to somewhat said
<PB N="51" REF="003887_0054_10020CE41AD55E98"/>before. The Temptation had been else too <HI>abrupt,</HI> and the Devil had betray'd himself to be endued with <HI>more</HI> than humane Knowledge; even to know what God had said to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> while he was yet a <HI>Brute</HI> and without Understanding.— Or if you would chuse to think, that the Serpent would have <HI>Eve</HI> imagine, that he had indeed attain'd to the Intelligence of <HI>Angels</HI> by eating of the forbid∣den Fruit, it will but carry the Deception yet <HI>higher,</HI> and make the Temptation so much the stronger.—But it is more likely that he appear'd to take this Information from her own <HI>Lips,</HI> and leads her into Wonder and <HI>Inquisitiveness</HI> after the <HI>Reason</HI> of such a Prohibition to them; while she saw (as was pretended) the happy wondrous <HI>Effect</HI> that the Fruit had on him, the <HI>Serpent,</HI> that was before an ignorant and <HI>dumb</HI> Beast.—And when the <HI>Devil</HI> had by this <HI>Wile</HI> shook her Mind, rais'd in her a <HI>Suspense</HI> and doubtful Admiration, and too much a Regard to her Senses, in a Contradiction to the Word of God; then the <HI>Tempter</HI> boldly shot his <HI>fiery Dart,</HI> and as a Creature of superior Light said to the <HI>Woman, "Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the Day you eat your Eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God's, knowing Good and Evil.</HI></P>
<P>This bold <HI>Satanical</HI> Reasoning had its cursed Effect upon the Mind and Heart of <HI>Eve!</HI> She took in the Poison of <HI>Pride,</HI> and the <HI>Lust</HI> after more Knowledge conceived within her, and she <HI>fell</HI> after the Example of <HI>Satan.</HI> She look'd upon the Fruit with Desire, believing all that the <HI>Serpent</HI> had said of it. It <HI>look'd</HI> good for food; nay the Serpent had <HI>found</HI> it so: It was pleasant to her <HI>Eye,</HI> but more to her aspiring <HI>Mind:</HI> She consi∣dered it as desirable to make her <HI>wise,</HI> wise as the <HI>Angels</HI> of God who know <HI>good and evil:</HI> She gree∣dily took therefore of the Fruit and eat, <HI>and gave
<PB N="52" REF="003887_0055_10020C88E6A5C0C8"/>also to her Husband with her, and he did eat.</HI> That is to say, She went away to <HI>Adam,</HI> with some of the Fruit in her Hand, and told him of all that she had <HI>seen</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> of the Serpent's <HI>eating</HI> and <HI>speaking,</HI> with Understanding equal if not superior to their own; and that he had told her to what <HI>Angelical and Godlike Heights of Knowledge</HI> the Fruit will raise <HI>them</HI> upon their eating of it: To all which <HI>Adam</HI> hearkened, and from a <HI>like Lust after for∣bidden Knowledge,</HI> he suddenly, rashly and fatally took from his Wifes Hand and eat.</P>
<P>It seems to me, that our First Parents not tak∣ing Time to <HI>deliberate</HI> on the Matter, did not see into the real <HI>Devilism</HI> of the Serpent's Words; that it was a giving God the <HI>Lye,</HI> |and to <HI>tax</HI> him with want of Goodness and Bounty to his Creatures, or with grudging to 'em and denying them the Know∣ledge that was proper for 'em. Or if we may think that the sagacious Minds of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> could not fail of these Reflections upon the Devil's Words, then was their <HI>Crime</HI> and Guilt so much the more like unto the very <HI>Devils</HI> who deceived them.</P>
<P>And now I may appeal unto the Heart of every impartial <HI>Reader,</HI> if <HI>Moses</HI> has not given us the most <HI>likely</HI> Account we can imagine, of the <HI>Seduction</HI> and Fall of our first Parents? <HI>How the Serpent be∣guiled Eve thro' his Subtlety! how by one Man Sin has enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin, and has passed upon all! how by one Man's Disobedience all are made Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>I go on now to the <HI>Consequents</HI> upon the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> as they are related by <HI>Moses:</HI> And for my own part I cannot but think the <HI>Account</HI> given by him to be so <HI>rational</HI> and natural, that I cannot imagine how it <HI>could</HI> be otherwise. That is to say,</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="003887_0056_10020CE6FA446D78"/>
<HI>First,</HI> That as soon as our <HI>First Parents</HI> had sinned <HI>they saw themselves naked:</HI> i. e. found themselves under some shameful <HI>Disorder</HI> both of Mind and Body: A Cloud came upon their Minds, Guilt stung 'em, Fear seiz'd 'em, and they saw each other's Face chang'd for the worse: The Joys of Inno∣cence left their Eyes, the Poison of the Fruit work'd in their Veins, sick Qualms and cold Sweats came upon them, and their Minds were full of Confusion and Consternation at their Disappoint∣ment: They felt the forbidden <HI>Knowledge of Evil,</HI> and were ready to run and hide themselves any where.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is most reasonable to think that <HI>God would now appear, arraign and condemn them to die,</HI> according to his <HI>Threatning</HI> in Case they disobey'd Him. Whereupon it is natural to think <HI>the Sinners would fly from his Presence,</HI> as <HI>Moses</HI> says they did, as soon as they <HI>heard his Voice.</HI>—It is also altoge∣ther worthy of GOD to <HI>call them forth</HI> with the Voice of an offended Father and Judge, <HI>Adam, where art thou?</HI> — The Answer of <HI>Adam</HI> must needs be just as <HI>Moses</HI> relates it; scil, a plain <HI>Con∣fession</HI> of his Crime; for there was no hiding it. <HI>"And he said, I heard thy Voice in the Garden and was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid my self.</HI> Shame naturally hides it self, and Fear flies.— This was Confession eno' of the Fact to <HI>God,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Reply</HI> is just which <HI>Moses</HI> gives us from the Mouth of God, "Who <HI>told thee that thou wast naked? hast thou eaten of the Tree whereof I com∣manded thee, that thou shouldst not eat?</HI> q. d. No∣thing but the Loss of thy Innocence, and Guilt of Sin, could strike thee with this Fear, and cover thee with this Shame: Where is the Love and Joy with which you were won't to welcome my Presence? — And now what could <HI>Adam</HI> say for himself, but those words which <HI>Moses</HI> relates, lay∣ing
<PB N="54" REF="003887_0057_10020C8C2E4A3070"/>the Blame on his <HI>Wife,</HI> who was <HI>first</HI> in the Transgression? And what should <HI>Eve</HI> answer, but as <HI>Moses</HI> has it, <HI>"The Serpent beguiled me.</HI> — And upon this their Confession what should follow, but God's passing <HI>Sentence</HI> and <HI>Judgment?</HI> — And <HI>where</HI> should the Judgment <HI>begin,</HI> but on the <HI>Ser∣pent?</HI> i. e. <HI>Satan</HI> the Contriver and Author of all this Sin and Mischief.— And first the <HI>Curse</HI> falls upon the <HI>Instrument</HI> which the Devil us'd, <HI>the Ser∣pent;</HI> and our Parents saw the Creature <HI>chang'd</HI> from that beauteous Form wherein it was before, <HI>into a crawling hissing Snake,</HI> viler than every Beast about them, to slide upon his Belly in the Dust, and feed upon it. No doubt, this Change upon the Serpent struck <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> with new Re∣morse and Terror; as a Criminal that is to die for <HI>Beastiality</HI> sees with Horror the poor <HI>Beast</HI> slain before his Eyes, as the dire <HI>Prologue</HI> to his own Execution. — Then under the Shadow of the En∣mity that should for ever be between the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Eve</HI> and every Kind of <HI>Serpents,</HI> which we all know to be universal and invincible; (<HI>These</HI> being ever ready at the <HI>Heels</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> to <HI>bite</HI> 'em, and <HI>They</HI> being ever as ready to <HI>bruise</HI> the <HI>Heads</HI> of Serpents and destroy them) I say, under the Image of <HI>this,</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> is told of and threatned with <HI>a glorious</HI> SEED <HI>of this poor miserable Woman</HI> that should <HI>break his Head,</HI> while he should be only able <HI>to bruise his Heel.</HI> — This was a <HI>deadly</HI> Word to the <HI>Old Serpent, the Devil and Satan;</HI> and no doubt the <HI>Fiend</HI> was struck with <HI>Torments</HI> by it, which no Humane Soul can think of. And fit it was the <HI>Judgment</HI> should begin with <HI>him</HI> who was the guilty <HI>Cause</HI> and Beginning of all this <HI>Tra∣gedy.</HI>— At the same Time, It was a most <HI>merciful Revelation of a</HI> SAVIOUR, and of a <HI>Suffering</HI> RE∣DEEMER, to be born of <HI>Eve, born of a Woman</HI> without the Concurrence of <HI>a Son of Adam;</HI> who
<PB N="55" REF="003887_0058_10020CE89774C2C0"/>should conquer <HI>Satan</HI> and <HI>destroy his Work</HI> and <HI>abolish Death,</HI> by recovering Souls from Sin &amp; Hell. All which has been fulfilled, we know, in the Per∣son, Temptations, Ministry, Miracles, Obedience, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection, Ascention and Reign of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the <HI>Second A∣dam;</HI> Who will come again in Glory <HI>to judge An∣gels, and cast Death and Hell into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone.</HI>—The <HI>Devil</HI> heard this his Judg∣ment, and <HI>trembled,</HI> tho' he understood it not at the Time. Our <HI>Parents</HI> also heard it, and were enlightned to conceive of <HI>some most glorious Deli∣verer, a Son of Eve,</HI> in God's Time; and it was <HI>Life from the Dead</HI> to them; while it was <HI>Death and Damnation</HI> in the worst <HI>Form</HI> that could be to the <HI>proud Serpent,</HI> to be overcome, destroyed, judged and damned by a <HI>mortal Son</HI> of that <HI>weak Woman,</HI> whom he had just deceiv'd into Sin and Ruin.— Say now, if this was not worthy of the Infinite Wisdom and <HI>Foreknowledge</HI> of God, his Sovereignty and Dominion, his Justice Mercy and Grace! <HI>This is the</HI> LORD'S <HI>Doing and wonderful in our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Then GOD, the <HI>Judge,</HI> proceeded and told the <HI>Woman,</HI> that he would <HI>multiply her Sorrows</HI> in bear∣ing Children, for alluring her <HI>Husband</HI> into Sin; and that henceforth <HI>She</HI> and her <HI>Daughters</HI> should be in such a suffering sort of <HI>Subjection</HI> to the <HI>Mens</HI> disordered Passions, as they would never at all have known, if She had not been an <HI>Instru∣ment</HI> in his Sin and Fall. — The <HI>Man</HI> also was told that <HI>the Ground was cursed for his sake,</HI> that <HI>in Sorrow he should eat of it all the Days of his Life, till he return'd into it:</HI> Which Words were a plain and express <HI>Reprieve</HI> granted to <HI>Adam and Eve</HI> from deserved <HI>instant</HI> Death; but as plain and positive a Declaration of <HI>Death working in them,</HI> from that Day forward, and bringing them down
<PB N="56" REF="003887_0059_10020C8F6D0FF320"/><HI>slowly</HI> to the Grave. — All Mankind have been from that Day a <HI>Comment</HI> on this righteous and terrible Judgment of God; having the full <HI>Expe∣riment</HI> of it in Themselves. All sadly know the <HI>Truth</HI> of it. It has been, is and will be to the End of the World, as <HI>Moses</HI> has written. <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>Sin</HI> is the Original, Cause and Means, of all the dolorous <HI>Diseases</HI> of Body and <HI>Griefs</HI> of Mind, which bring on that Death, to which every Son and Daughter of <HI>Adam</HI> are inevitably doom'd by the righteous <HI>Sentence</HI> of God.</P>
<P>And now say, Have we not Reason to think that <HI>Moses</HI> has writ from the Mouth of <HI>God,</HI> in all this Account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall and Punishment, and of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Agency therein and Judgment therefor? It agrees to all the present known State of Man∣kind, our dying Condition, the Sorrows of our Life, our Proness and Temptations to Sin, our Lusts and Corruptions, and our fearful Apprehen∣sions of the Eternal Judgment of God, a <HI>Hell of Devils.</HI></P>
<P>These Things might be easily <HI>enlarg'd</HI> on, but the bare simple Mention of them carries, I think, a Light and Conviction to every sober consider∣ing Mind. A more reasonable Account of the <HI>Origine of Sin on Earth,</HI> and of the <HI>Sorrows and Death</HI> the Demerit thereof, and of a <HI>final Delive∣rance</HI> therefrom <HI>by the Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS, cannot enter into the Heart of Man to conceive of. A better <HI>Foundation for Christianity</HI> could not have been contrived by <HI>Moses,</HI> had he liv'd and wrote after the Manifestation of CHRIST in the Flesh, and after his <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the Dead.</P>
<P>But alas! the <HI>Sons of Eve</HI> are born with the Seed and Poison of <HI>Infidelity</HI> in their Veins! that
<PB N="57" REF="003887_0060_10020CEAB4CB5D98"/><HI>Poison</HI> which the <HI>Serpent</HI> infus'd into <HI>her</HI> before she eat of the forbidden Fruit. And the Agency of the <HI>Devil</HI> is the same in all his <HI>Temptations</HI> to In∣fidelity at this Day.— In <HI>vain</HI> has God told us how <HI>Satan</HI> seduced our first <HI>Mother;</HI> for we are <HI>still</HI> willingly beguiled by him; <HI>disbelieve and eat and die.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> is in Men in all their <HI>Unbelief,</HI> as much as he was in the <HI>Serpent</HI> that deceived <HI>Eve:</HI> the HOLY GHOST tells us so, and deplores the Misery of an unbelieving World: Psal. lviii. 3, 4, 5. <HI>The wicked are estranged from the Womb; they go astray as soon as they are born speaking Lies: Their Poison is like the Poison of a Serpent, they are like the deaf Adder that stoppeth her Ear; which will not hearken to the Voice of Charmers, charming never so wisely.</HI> Our LORD JESUS repeats the dreadful Words, and I will close my <HI>Argument</HI> with his just Reprehension and <HI>Rebuke of the Infidels</HI> in his Day: John viii. 43, 44, 45. <HI>For I proceeded and came forth from God, neither came I of my self, but He sent me: Why do ye not understand my Speech? even because ye cannot hear my Word. Ye are of your Fa∣ther the</HI> DEVIL, <HI>and the Lusts of your Father ye will do; He was a</HI> MURDERER <HI>from the Beginning, and abode not in the</HI> TRUTH <HI>because there is no Truth in him: When he speaketh a</HI> LYI <HI>he speaketh of his own; for he is a Liar and the Father of it: And because I tell you the</HI> TRUTH, <HI>ye believe me not.</HI></P>
<P>Let us be deeply <HI>affected</HI> with, and greatly <HI>be∣wail</HI> our Selves under, all the <HI>Sin and Evil</HI> that the Transgression of our <HI>First Parents</HI> has bro't up∣on us: <Q><HI>Original Sin without us,</HI> (as <HI>One</HI> speaks) and also <HI>within us</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Farth and Practice.

<P>From the Whole it appears, that GOD is most <HI>Good</HI> and We <HI>evil.</HI> As <HI>Moses</HI> finishes his Account of the Works of GOD with the <HI>best</HI> and most snitable <HI>Word</HI> that could be spoken; <HI>And God saw every Thing that he had made, and behold it was very good!</HI> So give me Leave to close this Contem∣plation of GOD OUR MALER with an Adoring Ac∣knowledgment of <HI>His Goodness,</HI> and the most abasing Confession of <HI>our own Vileness and Sinsulness.</HI> Now let <HI>our Eyes see</HI> HIM, and let us <HI>abber our Selves, repenting in Dust and Ashes.</HI> This <HI>only</HI> have we found by our <HI>Enquiry</HI> after the Work of God, (and <HI>Solomon</HI> with all his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> giving his Heart to see and search, found only this at last) Eccl. vii. 29. <HI>That GOD made Man upright, but They have sought out many Inventions.</HI> <Q>As our <HI>first Parents,</HI> so all their <HI>Posterity</HI> after them, by the Instigation of <HI>Satan,</HI> have sought and are seeking out <HI>new Ways</HI> of making Themselves more <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>happy</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in Loc.</NOTE>.</Q> But O how much <HI>in vain,</HI> and to their
