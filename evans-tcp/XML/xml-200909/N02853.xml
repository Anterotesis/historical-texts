<L>(Who ne'er in vain at Friend or Foe,</L>

<L>Others were left on Foot to trudge it,</L>
<L>(With Carbine slung, like Tinkers Budget)</L>
<L>That to the Combat did advance, Sir,</L>
<L>Mounted on Skeletonian Prancer,</L>
<L>Whose down-cast Looks seem'd to foretell</L>
<L>Their certain Fate, in Battle fell:</L>

<L>Whom the Besiegers, with small Pains,</L>
<L>To <HI>Pluto</HI> sent, without their Brains:</L>
<L>Which treach'rous Act (by all Relations</L>
<L>Against the Law of Arms and Nations)</L>
<L>Provok'd the <HI>Infidels</HI> with Ire</L>
<L>And Indignation to retire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO in the Night they lest their Cell,</L>
<L>(Resemblance of a future Hell)</L>
<L>And to their Subterfuges went,</L>
<L>On bloody Vengeance fully bent,</L>
<L>Leaving the <HI>English</HI> (struck with Wonder)</L>

<L>Who pelted at the <HI>Daemons</HI> Nest,</L>
<L>With Courage not to be express'd;</L>
<L>Whilst the Delinquents, in their Flight,</L>
<L>In <HI>Morpheus'</HI> Arms slew Ten out-right</L>
<L>Of the Besiegers, whom they found</L>
<L>Extended on the Mossy Ground;</L>
<L>And to compleat their surious Anger,</L>

<L>They made the Number up Threescore,</L>
<L>Leaving them welt'ring in their Gore,</L>
<L>Whose harmless Lives (like bloody Hounds)</L>
<L>They had let out by mortal Wounds.</L>

<L>"Telling how <HI>Popps</HI> and <HI>Squaws</HI> lay dead,</L>
<L>"(Like rotten Sheep) for want of Bread:</L>

<L>On any Terms t'accept a Peace</L>
<L>From <HI>Infidels;</HI> that, like wild <HI>Geese,</HI></L>
<L>Beyond the <HI>Western</HI> Mountains roam,</L>
<L>And rarely can be found at Home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS rais'd the <HI>Indians</HI> mortal Rage,</L>
<L>Which nought but Death of Foes could 'swage,</L>
<L>Who to their Aid (to share the Spoil,</L>

<LG>
<L>GREAT was the Slaughter, great the Cries,</L>
<L>(Throughout the <HI>English</HI> Colonies)</L>
<L>Of Murders, Rapines, Conflagrations,</L>
<L>Committed by outrag'ous Nations;</L>
<L>Like antient <HI>Picts</HI> of monstrous Size,</L>
<L>And Aspect frightful to the Eyes:</L>
<L>Tho' false, and Cowards in their Natures,</L>
<L>Yet terrible and fierce as <HI>Satyrs;</HI></L>
<L>As many found it to their Cost,</L>
<L>Who dearest Friends, and Substance lost;</L>
<L>With plenteous Crops, and Herds and Flocks,</L>

<L>THUS was <HI>VIRGINIA</HI>'s pros∣pr'ous State</L>
<L>Disturb'd at first, by adverse Fate;</L>
<L>With <HI>Indian</HI> Wars, and various Rumors,</L>
<L>Which ended with intestine Tumors;</L>
<L>That Minds, to dire <HI>Rebellion</HI> bent,</L>
<L>Rais'd to disturb the Government;</L>
<L>Beyond WILL's Power to prevent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR <HI>Fortune,</HI> that is ever fickle,</L>
<L>And always has some Rods in Pickle,</L>
<L>To plague the <HI>Governour</HI> much more</L>
<L>Than she had done some Years before,</L>
<L>Rais'd civil Discords in the People,</L>
<L>Who, chatt'ring like <HI>Jack-daws</HI> in Steeple,</L>
<L>Against Sir <HI>William;</HI> chose this <HI>Bacon</HI></L>
<L>Their <HI>Champion;</HI> whom at first I spake on;</L>
<L>A Man respected by the Mob,</L>
<L>As a fit Fool to do their Jobb;</L>
<L>Who, Sword in Hand, would rescue Cattle,</L>
<L>And give the <HI>Indians</HI> bloody Battle;</L>
<L>That had from <HI>MAR'LAND</HI> taken Flight,</L>
<L>Dreading with <HI>Bonnett</HI> New to fight,</L>
<L>Who well they knew (as <HI>Scotch Highlander</HI>)</L>
<L>Was hot, as fiery <HI>Salamander.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WRAPT in their little <HI>God</HI> of Strife,</L>
<L>Who was (to draw him to the Life)</L>
<L>From Head to Foot scarce Nine-pin high,</L>
<L>Nor half so thick as <HI>Magogg</HI>'s Thigh,</L>
<L>The Male-contents with one Consent,</L>
<L>Brave <HI>Nat</HI> with Praises compliment;</L>
<L>Then to Sir <HI>William</HI> recommend him,</L>
<L>As qualified, would he send him</L>
<L>With Force their <HI>Gen'ralissimo,</HI></L>
<L>'Gainst their <HI>Ocanackeean</HI> Foe:</L>
<L>But WILL, that better knew than they,</L>
<L>The <HI>Indian</HI> Game he had to play,</L>
<L>Would not on any Motives yield,</L>
<L>To let <HI>Nat</HI> govern in the Field;</L>
<L>And in Derision bid them nim'ly</L>
<L>"Go smoak their <HI>Bacon</HI> in the Chimney.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW as these Matters were debating,</L>
<L>(At Council-board scarce worth relating)</L>
<L>News came, that much disturb'd <HI>Nat</HI>'s Quiet,</L>
<L>Of an unlawful <HI>Indian</HI> Riot,</L>
<L>Committed by a Generation</L>
<L>Of Vipers, rifling his Plantation;</L>
<L>Who, not content the same to plunder,</L>
<L>Had Overseer cut in sunder.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEREFORE, at this unhappy Season,</L>
<L>Without consulting first his Reason,</L>

(Like unadvised <HI>Polititian</HI>)</L>
<L>He readily accepts Commission,</L>
<L>From furious Mobb, who give their Hand,</L>

<L>THUS, great as <HI>Noll,</HI> as <HI>Quixot</HI> stout,</L>
<L>At Head of Planters he rid out,</L>
<L>The Woods of <HI>Salvages</HI> to clear,</L>
<L>Pursu'd by BERKLEY in the Rear;</L>

<L>Had sally'd forth from <HI>Midd Plantation,</HI></L>

<L>As in the Sequel of the Story</L>
<L>Appears; eclipsing <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Glory.</L>

<L>With Forty Men and <HI>Mack'rel</HI> Gale</L>
<L>For the <HI>Metropolis</HI> set sail:</L>
<L>When dropping Anchor, 'twas their Fate,</L>
<L>To be made Prisoners of State;</L>
<L>And then by <HI>Gard'ner</HI> fore'd on Board,</L>
<L>Whose Ship before the Town was moar'd:</L>
<L>Whither in Spight of all Denial,</L>
<L>The <HI>Rebels</HI> were convey'd for Trial,</L>
<L>By Order of the higher Powers,</L>
<L>(Huzza'd by Mobb from <HI>Oaken</HI> Bowers)</L>
<L>Where instantly they were acquitted;</L>
<L>And <HI>Bacon</HI> once again admitted,</L>

<L>To make him <HI>Gen'ral</HI> of a Party;</L>
<L>Intended by the <HI>Government,</HI></L>

<L>And (as <HI>Civilians</HI> say) not binding,</L>
<L>Grounded on mental Reservation;</L>

<LG>

<L>How BERKLEY'S blind Credulity,</L>
<L>By the <HI>Imposter</HI> was rewarded,</L>
<L>As it in Story stands recorded.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>NAT</HI> having play'd this cunning Trick,</L>
<L>Instead of visiting the Sick,</L>
<L>Before black Messenger rid Post,</L>
<L>(As if the De'el had drove) to th' Host;</L>
<L>To head a factious, stubborn Crew,</L>
<L>(As e're o're Seas for Refuge flew)</L>
<L>Of Servants, Slaves, and Overseers,</L>
<L>At least Five Hundred Mutineers;</L>
<L>That to insult the <HI>Government,</HI></L>
<L>(By <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Preincouragement)</L>
<L>At <HI>Nat</HI>'s Approach began <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bluster,</L>
<L>And <HI>Hurley-burley</HI> soon did muster,</L>
<L>Like Tumble-T—ds got in a Cluster.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH these new listed Sons of Plunder,</L>
<L><HI>Nat</HI> enter'd Town, to BERKLEY'S Wonder;</L>
<L>Who, when required to make good</L>
<L>His Promise, like a Statue stood:</L>
<L><HI>Nat</HI> threatening to give no Quarter,</L>
<L>But burn poor WILL like <HI>Smithfield Martyr;</HI></L>
<L>Swearing, that if he lost his Aim,</L>
<L>He'd put the City in a Flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT this the House, thro' Fear, divide,</L>
<L>And BERKLEY'S take, or <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Side;</L>
<L>In whose Behalf (to save the Hive)</L>
<L>'Twas carried in th' Affirmative,</L>
<L>"That <HI>Nat</HI> should <HI>General</HI> be sent,</L>
<L>"Intestine Quarrels to prevent;"</L>
<L>Who, with his new created Power,</L>
<L>(Extorted in an evil Hour</L>
<L>By Force of Arms) rid from his Dwelling,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Oliver,</HI> a Colonelling.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FIRST then, he settles Ways and Means,</L>
<L>For proper Posture of Defence;</L>
<L>Then fits his Troops, then makes Drums rattle</L>
<L>For March, to give the <HI>Indians</HI> Battle.</L>

<L>NOW b'ing advanc'd to Out-plantations</L>
<L>Searching for Foes of <HI>Indian</HI> Nations;</L>
<L>News comes of BERKLEY'S Preparations:</L>
<L>Which puts the <HI>Rebels</HI> to their Trumps,</L>

</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>NEXT I describe t'you <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Army,</L>
<L>You need not fear, they will not harm ye;</L>
<L>Altho' they were (whilst under <HI>Nat</HI>)</L>
<L>Like <HI>Kentish Rebels,</HI> led by <HI>Watt;</HI></L>
<L>A thoughtless, giddy Multitude,</L>
<L>From <HI>Newgate,</HI> and from <HI>Bridewell</HI> spew'd,</L>

<L>WITH these undaunted mean <HI>Rascallions</HI></L>
<L>Poor <HI>Shabberoon Tatterdemallions;</HI></L>
<L>(The small Remains of those <HI>Battalions,</HI>)</L>
<L><HI>Nat</HI> on the <HI>Frontiers</HI> turn'd a Drift,</L>
<L>Amongst the Planting Herd to shift;</L>
<L>Through pathless Woods his Way he made,</L>
<L>To turn the Town into Blockade;</L>
<L>Which BERKLEY, whom the Mob detested,</L>
<L>In <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Absence had in vested;</L>
<L>Transporting from the <HI>Eastern</HI> Shore</L>
<L>(T'augment the Force he had before)</L>
<L>Of Arms and Ammunition Store,</L>
<L>And Men, who fought for ready Pay,</L>
<L>Twelve Pence a Head, for ev'ry Day;</L>
<L>With Plunder of all that had taken</L>
<L>Rebellious Oath to Col'nel <HI>Bacon.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHO, on the Banks of <HI>Powhatan,</HI></L>
<L>Before th' intended Siege began,</L>
<L>First cramm'd his Army, ev'ry Man,</L>
<L>With Hommony and Pone, and got,</L>
<L>Sufficient Progg for Pan and Pot,</L>
<L>With Drams enough of <HI>Aquae vitae,</HI></L>
<L>To make his Men like Devils fight ye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT e'er he could the Siege commence,</L>
<L>He needed Trenches for Defence;</L>
<L>Which thus he made: First, out he sent</L>
<L>Some Horse and Foot, with an Intent</L>
<L>To seize the Wives of Loial Party,</L>
<L>And all that were not to him hearty;</L>
<L>These taken, sitting at their Dinners,</L>
<L>They drest with Aprons, Bibbs and Pinners;</L>
<L>And rang'd them on their Works, in View</L>
<L>Of <HI>Citadel</HI> and Cannon too:</L>
<L>So that no Loialist durst fire,</L>
<L>To make <HI>Baconians</HI> retire,</L>
<L>Lest, with his Foes, his Wife or Daughter</L>
<L>Might first be slain in common Slaughter.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="003407_0009_1003EE8A809B3278"/>
<L>SO, thus by Petticoats protected,</L>
<L>He rais'd the Works he had projected,</L>
<L>In Order to reduce the Town,</L>
<L>Taking at Night these Life-guards down,</L>
<L>Who trembling, in the Day time stood</L>
<L>Like Virgins bound to Stumps of Wood,</L>
<L>That were ordain'd by Fate's Decree,</L>
<L>To <HI>Hydra</HI>'s Jaws to be a Prey;</L>
<L>As Authors tell us in the Story,</L>
<L>So were these Women, to their Glory,</L>
<L>On <HI>Martial</HI> Bank oblig'd to stand,</L>
<L>Like Mourning Captives, Hand in Hand;</L>
<L>Leaving behind their Linen Geer,</L>
<L>When <HI>Phaebis</HI> in his hot Career,</L>
<L>Forsook the <HI>Western Hemisphere,</HI></L>
<L>Stuck artificially on Poles,</L>
<L>Which made their Husbands think, poor Souls,</L>
<L>They had done Duty all the Night,</L>
<L>Appearing still dress'd up in White,</L>
<L>To open View, as <HI>Sol</HI> begun</L>
<L>His Oriential Course to run:</L>
<L>But where they slept, 'tis hard to say,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Phosper</HI> usher'd in the Day;</L>
<L>Unless with <HI>Nat,</HI> a Nap they took</L>
<L>In Tent, as black as Chimney Nook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, having well secur'd his Men,</L>
<L>In Trenches deep (like Pigs in Pen)</L>
<L>He Female Pioneers dismiss'd,</L>
<L>To take their Rambles where they list;</L>
<L>Declaring they had done more Good</L>
<L>For him, whilst on the Ditch they stood,</L>
<L>Then e're their Husbands would perform,</L>
<L>For BERKLEY, whom he meant to storm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHO, b'ing inform'd the Fair were got,</L>
<L>Beyond the Reach of Cannon Shot,</L>
<L>Resolves with <HI>Bacon</HI> not to dally,</L>
<L>But boldly venture on a Sally;</L>
<L>And Storm <HI>Nat</HI>'s Hold, tho' at th' Expence</L>
<L>Of a few Men; to drive him thence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BESIDES his mercenary Troops,</L>
<L>Confin'd on Board (like Geese in Coops)</L>
<L>Might get the Scurvy (as he thought)</L>
<L>In Case to Shore they were not brought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OF these, WILL sends a Party strong,</L>
<L>That did to <HI>Accomack</HI> belong,</L>
<L>Commanded by one <HI>Huber Farrell,</HI></L>
<L>More us'd t'attack a Cyder Barrel</L>
<L>Than face a Toe upon old Sorrel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Ships forthwith began to play,</L>
<L>And with their Shot clear <HI>Farrell</HI>'s Way,</L>
<L>By Order of the <HI>Governour:</HI></L>
<L>But all in vain, <HI>Nat</HI> would not stir;</L>
<L>'Till lucky Chance did on him smile,</L>
<L>And render'd fruitless, <HI>Huber</HI>'s Toil:</L>
<L>Who (tho' he had but little Skill)</L>
<L>In's Thoughts did vie with <HI>Machiavel:</HI></L>
<L>Wherefore, resolv'd with <HI>Nat</HI> to cope,</L>
<L>Strutting at Head of Forlorn-hope,</L>
<L>(Sent out to drive <HI>Nat</HI> from his Trenches,</L>
<L>Well lin'd with Men, and stroling Wenches)</L>
<L>He bids his Bands, in <HI>Martial</HI> Paces,</L>
<L>By stooping down, to save their Faces</L>
<L>From Shot; (thus Woodcocks hide their Snout,</L>
<L>In Bush, but leave their Bodies out)</L>
<L>When once they saw him this to do,</L>
<L>He order'd them, to do so too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN marching on, a Ball from <HI>Nat</HI></L>
<L>Laid <HI>Farrell</HI> on his Belly flat;</L>
<L>Which b'ing observ'd by <HI>Farrell</HI>'s Bands,</L>
<L>They all fall flat upon the Sands,</L>
<L>Thinking he did it, as the Token,</L>
<L>Of what he just before had spoken:</L>
<L>Whereby a Body of Foot Soldiers,</L>
<L>Compos'd of Servants and Freeholders,</L>
<L>That follow'd <HI>Farrell</HI> in the Rear,</L>
<L>Were forc'd to halt when they drew near;</L>
<L>Which made a Troop of Horse, behind,</L>
<L>Towards the Marsh about to wind,</L>
<L>To see what should be the Occasion</L>
<L>Of unexpected Retardation;</L>
<L>Who looking over tow'rds the Main,</L>
<L>Thought all their Forlorn-hope were slain.</L>
<L>So Wheeling suddenly about,</L>
<L>They put their own Reserves to th' Rout;</L>
<L>Which made them all retire for Shelter,</L>
<L>In great Confusion, <HI>Helter-skelter,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="003407_0010_1003ED4119B65A08"/>
Excepting such as <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Shot</L>
<L>Imbargo'd dead upon the Spot,</L>
<L>And One or Two that in Retreat</L>
<L>Were trod i'th' Water under Feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAD <HI>Nat</HI> now follow'd them to Town,</L>
<L>No Doubt the Day had been his own;</L>
<L>When Cowards (brought from <HI>Accomack</HI>)</L>
<L>With Threats came out, with Fears ran back.</L>
<L>But <HI>Bacon</HI> thought his Forces were</L>
<L>Inserior to WILL'S Numbers far;</L>
<L>Which made him not pursue the Rabble,</L>
<L>And get so little in this Squabble:</L>
<L>In which Encounter some were wounded,</L>
<L>And Eight or Ten were killed or drowned.</L>
<L>Whereas each Man of <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Party,</L>
<L>Were still alive, and brisk and hearty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEXT Day, the <HI>Gen'ral</HI> was reliev'd,</L>
<L>With Reinforcements he receiv'd,</L>
<L>(Under Command of Major <HI>Whaley,</HI></L>
<L>Who had assisted <HI>Bacon</HI> daily)</L>
<L>With Pieces Three of heavy Cannon,</L>
<L>As good as e'er flung Shot o'er <HI>Shannon;</HI></L>
<L>Which <HI>Bacon</HI> mounted on the Trench,</L>
<L>In Order soon the Siege to clench;</L>
<L>And try, with this his fresh Assistance,</L>
<L>To drive the Ships to greater Distance;</L>
<L>Which (tho' as yet they'd done no Harm)</L>
<L>Might Neighbours prove, for him too warm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE <HI>Governour,</HI> at this sad News,</L>
<L>Did soon resolve, no Time to loose;</L>
<L>But, summoning both Old and Young,</L>
<L>He strait perswades the trembling Throng,</L>
<L>Like Men, to save themselves, retreating,</L>
<L>And not (like Dogs) run Risque of Beating.</L>
<L>So, Bag and Baggage, they by Night</L>
<L>To <HI>Accornack</HI> again take Flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Birds b'ing fled, <HI>Nat</HI> thought it best,</L>
<L>In Ashes to consume their Nest:</L>
<L>So, soon as WILL with Gang retir'd,</L>
<L>In Brutish Rage, the Town he fir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN, that he might Examples make,</L>
<L>Of all that BERKLEY'S Side shou'd take,</L>
<L>To shew that he would prove impartial,</L>
<L>He calls together a <HI>Court Martial,</HI></L>
<L>Condemns and shoots, before departing,</L>
<L>A poor Lieutenant, for Deserting,</L>
<L>Who fought for BERKLEY; tho' he'd taken</L>
<L>The Oaths before to Col'nel <HI>Bacon.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, having BERKLEY put to Rout,</L>
<L>For <HI>Green-Spring</HI> next he sac'd about.</L>
<L>Thence, with his Army, into <HI>Glo'ster,</HI></L>
<L>At <HI>Tindall</HI>'s-<HI>Point</HI> he boldly cross'd, Sir:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Bacon</HI> scarce Two Days had staid,</L>
<L>At Col'nel <HI>Warner</HI>'s, (as 'tis said)</L>
<L>Before a Letter, by a Post,</L>
<L>(Which did not much disturb his Host)</L>
<L>Informs him that one Col'nel <HI>Brent</HI></L>
<L>Had lest <HI>Pattowmack,</HI> with Intent</L>
<L>In WILL'S Behalf to give <HI>Nat</HI> Battle,</L>
<L>And make his Bones in's Skin to rattle,</L>
<L>With Men, a Thousand and Two Hundred,</L>
<L>As nimble Rogues as ever plunder'd,</L>
<L>(<HI>Stassordians, Indians,</HI> and <HI>new Negroes</HI>)</L>
<L>Destruction threat'ning to Besiegers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SURPRIS'D hereat, as well he might,</L>
<L>Not having Men such Odds to fight,</L>
<L>To Camp <HI>Nat</HI> comes, in mighty Heat,</L>
<L>Commanding first his Drums to beat.</L>
<L>Then to his Soldiers, in close Order,</L>
<L>Now under Colours, (like Recorder)</L>
<L>He ope's the Letter, <HI>Gutheridge</HI> sent,</L>
<L>And pumps, to find his Soldiers Bent,</L>
<L>Pretending Love to <HI>Government,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> tho' rebellious:</L>
<L>(Thus did old <HI>Noll,</HI> and <HI>Rumpish</HI> Fellows.)</L>
<L>Then Soldiers swear, by all the Gods,</L>
<L>They'd fight <HI>Brent</HI>'s Men, at Tripple Odds,</L>
<L>And under <HI>Nat</HI> wou'd singe their Codds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FROM thence to <HI>Gloster Courthouse</HI> strait,</L>
<L>In Rank and File they march'd; where Fate</L>
<L>Decreed the Fields should be their Quarters</L>
<L>That Night; but as they were true Starters,</L>
<L>For Col'nel <HI>Smith</HI>'s, near <HI>Purton,</HI> they</L>
<L>Began their March at Break of Day;</L>
<L>Where News was brought, by quick Express,</L>
<L>That <HI>Brent</HI> was lest in great Distress,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="003407_0011_1003ED3436BA5488"/>
His Men intending to desert,</L>
<L>And (most) to take the <HI>Traytor</HI>'s Part,</L>
<L>Consid'ring should they follow <HI>Brent,</HI></L>
<L>They might perhaps too late repent,</L>
<L>The Day they <HI>Bacon</HI>-hunting went.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS Cowards of a tim'rous Heart,</L>
<L>At their own Shadows often start,</L>
<L>Quit those that most in them confide,</L>
<L>And basely take the strongest Side.</L>
<L>So they, that most to <HI>Brent</HI> pretend,</L>
<L>I'th' Lurch do leave him in the End,</L>
<L>Adoring here the Rising <HI>Sun,</HI></L>
<L>As in the <HI>East,</HI> they say, 'tis done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE happy Tidings brought to <HI>Bacon,</HI></L>
<L>Who by the Ear wrong Sow had taken,</L>
<L>Did providentially prevent</L>
<L>A bloody War'twixt him and <HI>Brent.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW <HI>Nat</HI> to'th' Court-house does repair,</L>
<L>To meet the <HI>Gloster</HI> Gentry there,</L>
<L>According to his Invitation,</L>
<L>Not for the Sake of Recreation,</L>
<L>But to seduce them to his Measures,</L>
<L>And gain their helping Hand and Treasures,</L>
<L>Which always chiefest Sinews are</L>
<L>Alike, of just and unjust War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHO mounting Steeds, the Hero met,</L>
<L>On Propositions vile to treat,</L>
<L>Whom <HI>Nat</HI> with Flat'ry and Caresses,</L>
<L>With artful Rhetorick Addresses:</L>
<L>He tells them, smiling, Cap in Hand,</L>
<L>"That he from Friends did understand,</L>
<L>"They ne'er had sign'd the Covenant,</L>
<L>Then says, "He hopes they will partake on,</L>
<L>"The common Cause, with <HI>Patriot Bacon.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO which the Gentlemen reply'd,</L>
<L>"They would not join with either Side;</L>
<L>"For as they could not take the Oath,</L>
<L>"So to oppose him they were loath".</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO which the Gen'ral sternly said,</L>
<L>"They would be damn'd (be was afraid)</L>
<L>"With basest Villains, who expected</L>
<L>"The just Man's Peace, but Works neglected"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT this a certain Officer,</L>
<L>Apply'd to's Honour, saying, Sir,</L>
<L>"You've spoke to'th' Horse but not the Foot,</L>
<L>"'Tis ten to one, but they will do't".</L>
<L>Quoth <HI>Nat,</HI> "You miss my Speech's Force,</L>
<L>"I spoke to th' Men, and not the Horse,</L>
<L>"Though 'twas scarce worth my whil t' harangue'em,</L>
<L>"They're such obdurate Rascals, hang 'em;</L>
<L>"Pray you go speak t'your Brother Creatures,</L>
<L>"Asses best know the Horses Natures".</L>

<LG>
<L>HOWEVER, at a second Meeting,</L>
<L>At <HI>Warner</HI>'s House, for farther Treating,</L>
<L>The <HI>Gloster</HI> Men, th' Engagement sign'd,</L>
<L>And willingly with <HI>Bacon</HI> joyn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MEAN-WHILE there came a Letter o're,</L>
<L>Inviting <HI>Nat</HI> to th' <HI>Eastern</HI> Shore;</L>
<L>Humbly requesting, "That he wou'd,</L>
<L>"Come there, to rescue Publick Good,</L>
<L>"From <HI>Governor,</HI> who seiz'd Provision,</L>

<L>The Letter too, "In <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Power,</L>

<L>So probably to human Thinking,</L>
<L>BERKLEYAN Intr'est was just Sinking:</L>
<L>But Providence now interven'd,</L>
<L>And to <HI>Nat</HI>'s Life, soon put an End;</L>

Intending when he did recover,</L>
<L>To <HI>Eastern</HI> Shore to hurry over.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ON these Designs was <HI>Bacon</HI> harping,</L>
<L>At BERKLEY'S Conduct often carping;</L>
<L>When Death at's Chamber door came rapping,</L>
<L>As <HI>Moss</HI> caught Mare, took <HI>Bacon</HI> napping.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT e're he was by Death arrested,</L>
<L>With his Commission he invested,</L>
<L>One <HI>Johnson</HI> (alias) call'd <HI>Ingram,</HI></L>
<L>To head the Rebellious Army (trinctram;)</L>
<L>As <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> wise and brave,</L>

<L>BUT Hero now confin'd to Bed, Sir,</L>
<L>By Flux and Fever (as 'tis said, Sir)</L>
<L>By Lice was eaten up alive,</L>
<L>That crawl'd thro's Skin (as Bees from Hive)</L>
<L>From Maggots hatched in hot Brain,</L>
<L>Where Passage out they sought in vain,</L>
<L>Thro' brazen Front; so down they went,</L>
<L>And through his Pores found easy vent;</L>
<L>Where marching out in num'rous Armies,</L>
<L>They seiz'd 'Squire <HI>Bacon, vi &amp; Armis;</HI></L>
<L>So Vermin slew this Publick Evil,</L>
<L>That fear'd not GOD, nor Man, nor Devil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Gen'ral thus (as Herring dead)</L>
<L>Was wrapt in Winding Sheet of Leed,</L>
<L>And sunk into an Arm o'th' Ocean,</L>
<L>Because his fearful Friends had Notion,</L>
<L>That if his Carcass should be found,</L>
<L>By adverse Party under Ground,</L>
<L>To rot on Gibbet, Bones of <HI>Nat,</HI></L>

<L>Pickled his Pork in <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Brine;</L>
<L>In which sad Pickle for his Kitchins,</L>
<L>'Tis fear'd he 'as sows'd poor <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Flit∣chins.</L>
<L>He died o'th' Murrain (that is true)</L>
<L>Tho' Carron, yet De'll takes his Due:</L>
<L>At smallest Game, he'll take a Bout,</L>
<L>Rather than unconcern'd stand out:</L>
<L>Thus when he had no Fish to fry,</L>
<L>How Pork would do, he long'd to try:</L>
<L>He driving Hogs, need run, ('tis said)</L>
<L>Tho' brought to Market ne'er so bad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW tho' the Creepers spoilt their <HI>Bacon,</HI></L>
<L>For which at first, they sadly take on;</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Friends (I say't in Jest)</L>
<L>Of their bad market, made the best,</L>
<L>Which brought their Minds some little Rest:</L>
<L>For tho' they could not save their <HI>Bacon,</HI></L>
<L>They sav'd his Bones from being taken.</L>

<L>WHO's born for Hanging (Proverb says)</L>
<L>Ne'er needs fear Drowning in the Seas;</L>
<L>So, <HI>vice versa,</HI> 'stead of Tree,</L>
<L>The Fates ordain'd <HI>Nat</HI> to the Sea;</L>
<L>Who justly merited the Halter,</L>

<HEAD>CANTO III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<L><HI>This</HI> CANTO <HI>shews, how</HI> WILL <HI>came 'ore,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To chase the</HI> Male-Contents, <HI>once more:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who, under</HI> Ingram <HI>(as their Head)</HI></L>
<L><HI>Were to deserv'd Destruction led:</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Till at the last, these</HI> Rebels <HI>sell,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And that is all I have to tell.</HI></L>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THE News, that <HI>Bacon</HI> was departed,</L>
<L>Made BERKIEY once again light-hearted.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, tho' <HI>Nat</HI>'s dead, yet sad Distraction,</L>
<L>Springs from the Root of <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Faction:</L>
<L>The <HI>Rebels</HI> for the good old Cause,</L>
<L>Persist 'gainst <HI>Governour</HI> and Laws,</L>
<L>Who Might and Main, intended still,</L>
<L>With bloody Rods, to Whip poor WILL,</L>
<L>By Fighting under <HI>Ingram</HI>'s Banners,</L>
<L>And <HI>Whaley</HI>'s; whose rebellious Manners,</L>
<L>(Like <HI>Lambert</HI> and like <HI>Fleetwood</HI> bold)</L>
<L>Provok'd Sir WILLIAM, now grown old,</L>
<L>To try if he could stem the Tide,</L>
<L>Of Treason, and ambitious Pride,</L>
<L>That like a sudden Inundation,</L>
<L>Had drove him from his Habitation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE then conceiv'd, the surest Way</L>
<L>To quash the <HI>Rebels</HI> o're the <HI>Bay,</HI></L>
<L>Was now to strike, whilst Iron's hot,</L>
<L>And so make <HI>Traytors</HI> go to Pot;</L>
<L>Before they could their Courage rally,</L>
<L>So now he thought not fit to dally.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, at <HI>Noll</HI>'s Death (as Stories tell us)</L>
<L>WILL dockt the Rump of the Rebellious;</L>
<L>Of civil Wars, first clipt the Pinions,</L>
<L>Proclaiming <HI>Charles</HI> in his Dominions.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR of <HI>VIRGINIAN</HI> Territory,</L>
<L>'Tis said to their immortal Glory,</L>
<L>This Antient Colony most Loial,</L>
<L>Stuck longest firm to Party Royal;</L>
<L>And having last 'gainst <HI>Cromwell</HI> stood,</L>
<L>Did first restore the Common Good;</L>
<L>Being of all the <HI>English</HI> reckon'd,</L>
<L>The First that dare own <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Second.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALL this was done (as we are told)</L>
<L>Under Sir WILLIAM, Wise and Bold;</L>
<L>Who now to save his youthful Praise,</L>
<L>In his declining aged Days,</L>
<L>Did bravely rouse his drooping Sprits,</L>
<L>And (to augment his former Merits)</L>
<L>For Good of <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Colony,</HI></L>
<L>Resolves to Conquer, or to Dye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Scene thus chang'd, it was not long</L>
<L>Before he sent a Party strong,</L>
<L>In Sloop or Shallop (which please)</L>
<L>From <HI>Accomack, Nat</HI>'s Friends to seize;</L>
<L>That on <HI>York</HI>-Banks, the Coast to guard,</L>
<L>At <HI>Auborn</HI>'s House kept Watch and Ward:</L>
<L>Where Col'nel <HI>Hansford,</HI> with some others,</L>
<L>Who, in <HI>Rebellion,</HI> were sworn Brothers;</L>
<L>Was after some Resistance made,</L>
<L>Was after some Resistance made,</L>
<L>By <HI>Auborn</HI>'s wanton Wife betray'd;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="003407_0014_1003ED492999EED0"/>
And thence across the <HI>Bay</HI> convey'd,</L>
<L>And hang'd at <HI>Accomack,</HI> 'tis said.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS Expedition being over,</L>
<L>WILL (who with Friends did live in Clover)</L>
<L>Of whom the Mob did vilely talk,</L>
<L>Resolv'd the Matter not to baulk:</L>
<L>And so Embarks without Delay,</L>
<L>Then for <HI>York</HI>-River plows the <HI>Bay.</HI></L>
<L>Where having Wind, which prov'd a Flanker,</L>
<L>At <HI>Tindall</HI>'s <HI>Point</HI> he soon cast Anchor:</L>
<L>From whence, he sends forth Men Six Score,</L>
<L>Bold hardy Soldiers (less or more)</L>
<L>Marching in Ranks, of diff'rent Size,</L>
<L>Few Scatterlopers to surprise,</L>
<L>Of Male-contents, and beardless Boys,</L>
<L>That scarce had left their childish Toys;</L>
<L>Who at a House not far from thence,</L>
<L>In Arms were muster'd, on Pretence</L>
<L>Of standing in their own Defence;</L>
<L>Commanded by th' aforesaid <HI>Whaley,</HI></L>
<L>As great a Rogue, as <HI>Water Baily.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, lest his Soldiers should prove tardy,</L>
<L>He sent some Friends, both bold and hardy,</L>
<L>(As faithful <HI>Ludwell,</HI>) with Intent,</L>
<L>To give the more Encouragement;</L>
<L>Lest <HI>Hubert,</HI> who Commander went,</L>
<L>Should fail again in his Descent;</L>
<L>Who of the Wound, was now quite well,</L>
<L>He got, when he at <HI>James</HI>-Town fell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE now at <HI>Piny-point</HI> safe landed</L>
<L>By <HI>Hu</HI> (as said before) commanded;</L>
<L>Their Heads do first together lay,</L>
<L>To study out the safest Way,</L>
<L>Without much Loss, to win the Day;</L>
<L>On which they did not long consult,</L>
<L>Before they came to this Result,</L>
<L>That is: If Centry should demand</L>
<L>Who's there, or order them to stand,</L>
<L>To seize and gagg him; the <HI>Pell-mell,</HI></L>
<L>To enter into <HI>Rebels</HI> Cell;</L>
<L>Which had no Barricades by Chance,</L>
<L>So they the easier might advance,</L>
<L>And take the House in Dusk of Night,</L>
<L>Without the Risque of bloody Fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, pray behold the bad Conclusion,</L>
<L>Of this well grounded Resolution:</L>
<L>For 'stead of this to Centry's Call,</L>
<L>They made Reply with Musquet Ball.</L>
<L>So they by Centry were betray'd,</L>
<L>Who, when they Shot, loud Hollw'ing made,</L>
<L>To give Alarm to those i'th' House,</L>
<L>Who scarce awake, half drunk soon rouse</L>
<L>To Arms, and headlong fal'ing out,</L>
<L>Put <HI>Farrell</HI> and his Men to Rout;</L>
<L>Who dropping instantly a Stern,</L>
<L>Secur'd themselves behind a Barn,</L>
<L>To which i'th' Dark, they quickly got,</L>
<L>To screen themselves from <HI>Rebels</HI> Shot:</L>
<L>Where long they pelted at each other,</L>
<L>Tho' none was kill'd in all this Pother,</L>
<L>Excepting <HI>Hubert,</HI> who i'th' Chase,</L>
<L>Fell once again upon his Face;</L>
<L>When pop came Ball, from Musquet Barrel,</L>
<L>That thro' the Back shot <HI>Hubert Farrell.</HI></L>
</LG>

<L>THUS stoutest Braggadochio must</L>
<L>At last lay's Honour in the Dust:</L>
<L>So Pitcher now, you see is broke,</L>
<L>At <HI>James</HI> Town crack'd, by Random Stroke</L>
<L>From <HI>Nat;</HI> as I before have spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HIS Men observing him to fall,</L>
<L>Not by the Sword, as did King <HI>Saul,</HI></L>
<L>A board their Vessel, hast in Hurry,</L>
<L>T' avoid the Danger of the Florry;</L>
<L>Thro' thick and thin, thro' Mire and Sands,</L>
<L>One Pair of Heels, worth Two of Hands;</L>
<L>Happy the Man, that first can get</L>
<L>To Shallop, tho' like drown'd Rat wet,</L>
<L><HI>Higgledy Piggledy Malpas</HI> shot,</L>
<L>Heels over Heads, away they trot,</L>
<L>'Till safe unto their Boat they got:</L>
<L>Ev'n those that others Legs did use,</L>
<L>In getting out (to save their Shoes)</L>
<L>Run on their own Legs now, to choose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN <HI>Hubert</HI>'s miss'd, streight four or five,</L>
<L>Resolve to find him dead or'live,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="003407_0015_1003EE88E6298418"/>
Who for their Valour dearly paid,</L>
<L>Being by <HI>Whaley</HI> Pris'ner made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, though Sir WILLIAM lost the Day,</L>
<L>By <HI>Hubert</HI> basely giv'n away;</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Gloster</HI> Men, full Thirty Score,</L>
<L>With <HI>Middlesexians</HI> many more.</L>
<L>B'ing rais'd, he's brisker than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, see the Turns of Fate; for soon,</L>
<L>His Matters go but badly on;</L>
<L>For <HI>Ingram</HI> had no sooner heard</L>
<L>That all this Force for WILL appear'd,</L>
<L>But streight he sent Lieutenant <HI>Walkett,</HI></L>
<L>To <HI>Middlesex,</HI> to try to baulk it;</L>
<L>Who march'd with thirty able Horse,</L>
<L>The choicest of the <HI>Rebels</HI> Force;</L>
<L>And kept the Fort from Major <HI>Smith,</HI></L>
<L>A Friend of BERRLEY'S (spight of's Teeth)</L>
<L>For all he had Five Hundred Men,</L>
<L>So <HI>Smith</HI> soon marches back again</L>
<L>To Dwelling House of Mr. <HI>Pate,</HI></L>
<L>Where Matters were in dismal State.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR, <HI>Ingram</HI> having Information,</L>
<L>That <HI>Smith</HI> had left <HI>Pate</HI>'s Habitation,</L>
<L>Whips in between the House and Major,</L>
<L>And swore like Tinker in his Rage, Sir;</L>
<L>"That'less the Garr'son would surrender</L>
<L>"On Terms that he should please to tender,</L>
<L>"He'd Shoot, or Burn, or Hang, or Kill,</L>
<L>"Each Person that declar'd for WILL":</L>
<L>Which naughty Words, of wicked Whoreson,</L>
<L>Did so affright poor Captain Parson,</L>
<L>Whom <HI>Smith</HI> had left to guard the House,</L>
<L>(In Peace a Man, in War a Mouse)</L>
<L>That, not accustom'd to such Sport,</L>
<L>He forthwith gives him up the Fort,</L>
<L>Resolving now to mind his Church,</L>
<L>And ne'er more leave her in the Lurch;</L>
<L>But stick to's Text, and mind his Book,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Mars</HI> had such a dismal Look;</L>
<L>Ne'er fight again, with temp'ral Sword,</L>
<L>But fight the Battle of the Lord;</L>
<L>And never use a Sword at all,</L>
<L>Besides the Sword that's spirit'al.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>INGRAM,</HI> obtaining this Rendition,</L>
<L>Found Store of Arms and Ammunition,</L>
<L>With Provender for Man and Beast,</L>
<L>Which was laid in for Captain Priest:</L>
<L>On which he feasts, yet had the Sense</L>
<L>To keep in Posture of Defence;</L>
<L>Lest Major <HI>Smith</HI> should in the Centre,</L>
<L>Of all his Jollity re-enter;</L>
<L>And spoil his Stomach, by insisting</L>
<L>On Satisfaction, for such Twisting</L>
<L>Of Ducks and Capons (well worth praising)</L>
<L>And Roasters not of his own raising.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>SMITH,</HI> like a Lion to his Den,</L>
<L>Was now return'd, to <HI>Pate</HI>'s again;</L>
<L>Where much against his Expectation,</L>
<L>He <HI>Ingram</HI> found in Warlike Station,</L>
<L>Which prov'd to him a sad Vexation:</L>
<L>It made him Mad; but yet not quite</L>
<L>Enough to make him <HI>Ingram</HI> Fight;</L>
<L>Having more Wit in this his Anger,</L>
<L>Than to fall foul on this great Stranger.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILST <HI>Ingram,</HI> on the other Hand,</L>
<L>Did but on Part Defensive stand.</L>
<L>Each fear'd the Dance first to begin,</L>
<L>So Curs at one another grin.</L>
<L>Thus they continue Scolding, Bawling,</L>
<L>Like Cats in Cockloft Caterwawling:</L>
<L>Tho' some o'th' <HI>Rebels</HI> were for Blows,</L>
<L>Being half starv'd, for want of Cloaths,</L>
<L>Who env'ing Spruce BERKLIIAN'S Bravery,</L>
<L>Long'd for their Cloaths, to cloak their Knavery;</L>
<L>Whilst other <HI>Ingramites</HI> thought best,</L>
<L>Tho' naked, in whole Skins to rest;</L>
<L>Who on the Belly fully bent,</L>
<L>With Meat and Drink were well content.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT now lets us take a Turn, and see</L>
<L>How Major <HI>Smith,</HI> and's Men agree.</L>
<L>He and some <HI>Glocestrian</HI> Gentry,</L>
<L>Were into <HI>Pate</HI>'s for forcing Entry;</L>
<L>Who bold and zealous were for Battle,</L>
<L>To Life or Limb tho' ne'er so fatal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="003407_0016_1003ED32B404F4A0"/>
<L>OTHERS (by far the better Christians)</L>
<L>Wanted Retreat to greater Distance;</L>
<L>Who thought to spill Man's Blood was heinous;</L>
<L>Saying, the Guilt of Blood sha'nt stain us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A MIDDLE Sort, I now must mention,</L>
<L>That had a kind of mixt Intention;</L>
<L>Who wisely minded, that there are</L>
<L>Most bloody Accidents in War;</L>
<L>But that on t'other Hand to fly,</L>
<L>Would brand them with black Infamy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS Sort propose Capitulation,</L>
<L>To save their Lives and Reputation.</L>
<L>In this Tripartite Strife, at last</L>
<L>The light heel'd Gentry t'others cast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN each Man down his Arms does lay,</L>
<L>And wing'd with Fear, all run away;</L>
<L>Who, tho' they save their Hides and Cloaths,</L>
<L>Yet thus their Arms and Honour lose;</L>
<L>Nay spoil their Coat, with Blot of Coward,</L>
<L>Saith Herauld, under Marshal <HI>Howard.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LIKE harmless Lambs, they're now become,</L>
<L>Who bluster'd at first Noise of Drum,</L>
<L>And roar'd like <HI>Phalaris</HI>'s Bull,</L>
<L>With Rage and windy Courage full,</L>
<L>A mighty Cry, but little Wool.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LIKE <HI>Lewis, Smith</HI> with many Men</L>
<L>March'd out, and then run back again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW comes the Trick of Captain <HI>Gran∣tham,</HI></L>
<L>Which some think base; but I think hand∣some:</L>
<L>He long had traded in the Parts,</L>
<L>Knew Planters Tempers and their Hearts;</L>
<L>And had great Infl'ence far and near,</L>
<L>Either for Int'rest, Love, or Fear;</L>
<L>As many worthy Traders have,</L>
<L>Who in their Hands still keep the Staff;</L>
<L>By keeping Planters Egg in Nest,</L>
<L>Pray don't be Mad, 'tis but a Jest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS Captain, cut out for the Work,</L>
<L>I'th Nick of Time arriv'd in <HI>York;</HI></L>
<L>And privately on WILL attending,</L>
<L>Got Management o'th Cause depending;</L>
<L>For WILL and he together lay</L>
<L>Their Heads, the <HI>Traytors</HI> to betray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN under <HI>Rose,</HI> they had agreed,</L>
<L>To <HI>Ingram, Grantham</HI> goes with Speed,</L>
<L>To try what could be done by Skill,</L>
<L>Since Arms had fail'd i'th Cause of WILL.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>GRANTHAM,</HI> a nat'ral Rhetorician,</L>
<L>A Merchant, Tar, and Politician,</L>
<L>Did try with Words, as smooth as Oil,</L>
<L>If he could stubborn <HI>Ingram</HI> foil,</L>
<L>And <HI>Walkett,</HI> both to Reason bring;</L>
<L>'Who taking Arms against the King,</L>
<L>'Had Lives and Fortunes forfeited,</L>
<L>'And were in Law already dead:</L>
<L>'As <HI>Grantham</HI> told them; adding further,</L>
<L>'He really thought it wilful Murder</L>
<L>'To kill poor Subjects, on Pretence</L>
<L>'Of standing in their own Defence;</L>
<L>'Which could not be, since (as he heard)</L>
<L>'They by <HI>Nat</HI>'s Compass blindly steer'd;</L>
<L>'So if their Course they would not alter,</L>
<L>'They'd soon be moar'd to Tree, by Halter:</L>
<L>'So begg'd them well to weigh the Case,</L>
<L>'And Mercy by all Means embrace,</L>
<L>'Whilst certain Mercy could be found,</L>
<L>'Before the Men of War struck Ground,</L>
<L>'With Men 'tixt Decks, and Arms i'th Hold,</L>
<L>'Chuck-full, like <HI>Grecian</HI> Horse of Old'.</L>
<L>Thus he advis'd them to submit</L>
<L>To <HI>Government,</HI> if they thought fit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT this, they both began to look</L>
<L>As if they had been Thunder-struck,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Sligo</HI> saw; and then said he,</L>
<L>'Since you dead-hearted seem to be,</L>
<L>'I will with BERKLEY stand your Friend,</L>
<L>'Who to request may condescend,</L>
<L>'(Perhaps) a piteous Ear to lend:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="003407_0017_1003EE90C397F3D0"/>
'If you surrender to his Mercy,</L>
<L>'He'll pardon (I believe by Hear-say:)</L>
<L>'Besides, some Time with him I spent,</L>
<L>'Before I last to <HI>England</HI> went;</L>
<L>'And then to me he seem'd inclin'd</L>
<L>'To be compassionate and kind:</L>
<L>'So knowing him, and knowing you,</L>
<L>'I'll tell you what you'd best to do;</L>
<L>'And if you'll do as I wou'd have you,</L>
<L>'I dare believe, that I can save you'.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS friendly cordial Advice,</L>
<L>Made both the Wolves, as quank as Mice;</L>
<L>Both condescending for to take</L>
<L>The Terms that he should for them make:</L>
<L>The Terms agreed, he does propose</L>
<L>That they their Minds must not disclose,</L>
<L>Nor let their Army know what he</L>
<L>With both their Honours did agree;</L>
<L>But in their Noddles private keep all,</L>
<L>'Till he had fathomed the People.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS done, the Captain tacks about,</L>
<L>And next address'd the <HI>Rebel</HI>-Rout;</L>
<L>But with these Folks, sly <HI>Grantham</HI> found</L>
<L>That he should gain but little Ground,</L>
<L>Unless with Wheedles he could nick 'em,</L>
<L>And so into a Halter trick 'em;</L>
<L>Well knowing that he had to do</L>
<L>With Runaways and Freemen too.</L>
<L>At length he saith; 'Good Gentlemen,</L>
<L>'You know, that I long Time have been</L>
<L>'A Trader here, where I have got</L>
<L>'A deal to help to boil my Pot;</L>
<L>'But now (I tell you to my Cost)</L>
<L>'My Trade is likely to be lost,</L>
<L>'Whilst you bear Arms in this your Post;</L>
<L>'Poor Crops are made, Tobacco low;</L>
<L>'What I shall do, I do not know,</L>
<L>'For whilst you here are nothing doing,</L>
<L>'Merchant and Planter run to Ruin;</L>
<L>'You have been all, saith he (good Sirs)</L>
<L>'My Friends, Acquaintance, Customers;</L>
<L>'And often have had Room to try</L>
<L>'My Kindness to the Colony;</L>
<L>'B'ing bound in Interest and Honour,</L>
<L>'To love and value such a Donor;</L>
<L>'But you 'bove all (and then he swore)</L>
<L>'Who have been Dealers at my Store:</L>
<L>'Excuse me therefore, if I be</L>
<L>'For your own Good, too frank and free:</L>
<L>'I left a Fleet moar'd in the Downs,</L>
<L>'Freighted with Redcoats, Bloody Hounds:</L>
<L>'That <HI>CHARLES</HI> has sent to aid Sir WILLIAM,</L>
<L>'To seize the <HI>Rebels,</HI> and to kill 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT this they glibly swallow Bait,</L>
<L>And for Advice impatient wait;</L>
<L>Which they request, that he would give 'em,</L>
<L>And at this ticklish Point relieve 'em.</L>
<L>He soon reply'd, 'I'll go and try,</L>
<L>To sound Sir WILLIAM, by and by;</L>
<L>'I dare believe his Heart is tender:</L>
<L>'And he'll forgive, if you surrender</L>
<L>'On Terms like these: As first suppose,</L>
<L>'There was Indemnity for those</L>
<L>'That Freemen are and good Freeholders;</L>
<L>'And then for all the listed Soldiers,</L>
<L>'Suppose for them I get their Pay,</L>
<L>'And get the Servants freed, what say y'?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO this they soon unan'mously</L>
<L>With Thanks and Joy did all agree:</L>
<L>But yet before with them he parted,</L>
<L>Thinking the <HI>Gen'rals</HI> hollow-hearted,</L>
<L>He bid them not let <HI>Ingram</HI> know</L>
<L>What they had thus contriv'd to do;</L>
<L>Lest he and <HI>Walkett</HI> should prevent,</L>
<L>What was their Int'rest and Intent.</L>
<L>This done, they parted, <HI>Grantham</HI> went</L>
<L>Down to his Ship, they to the Tent.</L>
</LG>

<L>BUT 'twas not long e're <HI>Grantham</HI> brought</L>
<L>The Pardon, which the <HI>Rebels</HI> sought;</L>
<L>Which being drawn in ample Manner,</L>
<L>Induc'd them soon to strick their Banner.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEXT Day a board a Sloop they'r stow'd.</L>
<L>And down to <HI>Tindal</HI>'s-<HI>point</HI> are tow'd,</L>

<L>OH how WILL treats them with good Cheer:</L>
<L>With Pork, and Beef, and Drams, and Beer</L>
<L>Then after mutal Compliment,</L>
<L>Each to their Habitation went.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH joyful Hearts the Planters set</L>
<L>To Work, with Ax and Hough, to get</L>
<L>Their Bread, which each had often wanted,</L>
<L>Since last they'd Corn and 'Tatoes planted;</L>
<L>Resolving never more to enter,</L>
<L>Nor Corps in civil Wars to venture.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW Readers you must understand,</L>
<L>You are arriv'd in Sight of Land;</L>
<L>As said <HI>Diogenes</HI> of old,</L>
<L>When One a tedious Story told.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR finding the Conclusion near,</L>
<L>There's Land (saith he) brave Boys! don't fear.</L>
<L>Thus you may know by this Allusion,</L>
<L>My Story's almost at Conclusion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR now Sir WILLIAM'S got ashore,</L>
<L>And safe arriv'd at Home once more,</L>
<L>His House by Friends b'ing now retaken</L>
<L>From Garrison, put there by <HI>Bacon:</HI></L>
<L>Whence Goods and Prog were took, but <HI>Drummond</HI></L>
<L>And poor <HI>French Valet,</HI> paid for some on't,</L>
<L>Who almost starv'd and famish'd found,</L>
<L>Were soon truss'd up, Twelve Foot from Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND now each Party seem'd at Ease,</L>
<L>Supposing nought could break their Peace,</L>
<L>When Council and Assembly thought,</L>
<L>That some o'th archest <HI>Rebels</HI> ought,</L>
<L>By Death to make some Satisfaction,</L>
<L>For all the Ills of late Distraction,</L>
<L>To frighten Folks from trayt'rous Action.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN here and there did <HI>Rebel</HI> swing,</L>
<L>On Limbs of Trees, like Dogs in String.</L>
<L>To put the Saddle on right Horse,</L>
<L>The vilest hangs in Chains in Course;</L>
<L>So <HI>'Tony Arnold,</HI> who kept Ferry,</L>
<L>Was thus prefer'd to <HI>Charon</HI>'s Wherry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS oft the Villains Offspring find</L>
<L>Just Vengeance, when a like inclin'd</L>
<L>To do the same, as Dad had done,</L>
<L>And into Punishment will run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MAY all such <HI>Rebels</HI> to the State,</L>
<L>For <HI>Arnold</HI>'s Crimes have <HI>Arnold</HI>'s Fate,</L>
<L>Which basest <HI>Rebel</HI> did attone,</L>
<L>For Hundreds, who less Harm had done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, having told o'th' greatest Villain,</L>
<L>You can't expect me to go still on;</L>
<L>And other <HI>Rebels</HI> Names bespatter,</L>
<L>So Mum's the Word about this Matter.</L>
<L>I've said enough, I really think;</L>
<L>The more 'tis stir'd, the more 'twill stink.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO much for Hanging and for Killing,</L>
<L>Enough (I hope) for half Five Shillings;</L>
<L>For I v'e no more of this to tell,</L>
<L>'Ere you read <HI>Sotweed</HI> rest a Spell,</L>
<L>So for the present, Sirs, Farewell.</L>

<L>Of Friends unkind, and empty Purse,</L>
<L>Plagues worse than sill'd <HI>Pandora</HI>'s Box,</L>
<L>I took my Leave of <HI>Albion</HI>'s Rocks,</L>
<L>With heavy Heart, concern'd that I</L>
<L>Was forc'd my native Soil to fly,</L>
<L>And the old World must bid Good-b'ye:</L>
<L>But Heav'n ordain'd it shou'd be so,</L>
<L>And to repine is vain, we know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FREIGHTED with Fools, from <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> Sound,</L>
<L>To <HI>MARYLAND</HI> our Ship was bound;</L>
<L>Where we arriv'd, in dreadful Pain,</L>
<L>Shock'd by the Terrors of the Main;</L>
<L>For full Three Months our wav'ring Boat</L>
<L>Did thro' the surly Ocean float,</L>
<L>And furious Storms and threatning Blasts,</L>
<L>Both split our Sails, and sprung our Masts:</L>
<L>Weary'd, yet pleas'd we did escape</L>
<L>Such Ills, we achor'd at the <HI>Cape;</HI></L>
<L>But weighing soon, we plow'd the <HI>Bay,</HI></L>
<L>To cove it in <HI>Piscataway.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>INTENDING there to open Store,</L>
<L>I put myself and Goods on Shore,</L>
<L>Where soon repair'd a numerous Crew,</L>
<L>In Shirts and Draw'rs, of <HI>Scotch</HI>-cloth blew,</L>
<L>With neither Stocking, Hat, nor Shoe:</L>
<L>These <HI>Sotweed</HI> Planters crowd the Shore,</L>
<L>In Hew as tawny as a <HI>Moor;</HI></L>
<L>Figures, so strange, no GOD design'd</L>
<L>To be a Part of Human-kind:</L>
<L>But wanton Nature, void of Rest,</L>
<L>Moulded the brittle Clay in Jest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT last, a Fancy very odd,</L>
<L>Took me, This was <HI>The Land of</HI> Nod,</L>
<L>Planted at first when Vagrant <HI>Cain</HI></L>
<L>His Brother had unjustly slain;</L>
<L>Then, conscious of the Crime he'd done,</L>
<L>From Vengeance dire hither run,</L>
<L>And in a Hut supinely dwelt,</L>
<L>The first in <HI>Furrs</HI> and <HI>Sotweed</HI> dealt:</L>
<L>And ever since that Time, this Place</L>
<L>Has harbour'd a detested Race,</L>
<L>Who, when they could not thrive at Home,</L>
<L>For Refuge to these Worlds did roam,</L>
<L>In Hopes by Flight they might prevent</L>
<L>The Devil, and his fell Intent,</L>
<L>Obtain from Tripple-Tree Reprieve,</L>
<L>And Heav'n and Hell alike deceive:</L>
<L>But e're their Manners I display,</L>
<L>I think it fit I open lay</L>
<L>My Entertainment by the Way,</L>
<L>That Strangers well may be aware on</L>
<L>What homely Diet they must fare on;</L>
<L>To see that Shore where no good sense is found,</L>
<L>But Conversation's lost, and Manners drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I cross'd unto the other Side</L>
<L>A River, whose impetuous Tide,</L>
<L>Those <HI>Salvage</HI> Borders do divide,</L>
<L>In such a swimming odd Invension,</L>
<L>I scarce can give it's due Dimension,</L>

The <HI>Indians</HI> call this watry Waggon,</L>
<L><HI>Canoe,</HI> a Vessel none can brag on,</L>
<L>Cut from a Poplar Tree, or Pine,</L>
<L>And fashion'd like a Trough for Swine:</L>
<L>In this most noble Fishing-boat,</L>
<L>I boldly put my self afloat,</L>
<L>Standing erect, with Legs stretch'd wide,</L>
<L>We paddled to the other Side;</L>
<L>Where being landed safe by Hap,</L>
<L>(As <HI>Sol</HI> fell into <HI>Thetis'</HI> Lap)</L>
<L>A ravenous Gang, bent on the Strowl,</L>
<L>Of Wolves for Prey, began to howl:</L>
<L>This put me in a pannick Fright,</L>
<L>Lest I shou'd be devour'd quite:</L>
<L>But as I there a Musing stood,</L>
<L>And quite benighted in the Wood,</L>
<L>A Female Voice pierc'd thro' my Ears,</L>
<L>Crying, You Rogue drive home the Steers:</L>
<L>I listen'd that attractive Sound,</L>
<L>And streight a Herd of Cattle found,</L>
<L>Drove by a Youth, and homeward bound.</L>
<L>Cheer'd with the Sight, I streight thought fit</L>
<L>To ask, Where I a Bed might get?</L>
<L>The surly Peasant bid me stay,</L>
<L>And ask'd, From whom I'd run away?</L>
<L>Surpris'd at such a sawcy Word,</L>
<L>I instantly lugg'd out my Sword,</L>
<L>Swearing I was no Fugitive,</L>
<L>But from <HI>Great Britain</HI> did arrive,</L>
<L>In hopes I here might better thrive.</L>
<L>To which he mildly made Reply,</L>
<L><HI>I beg your Pardon, Sir, that I</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shou'd talk to you unmannerly:</HI></L>
<L><HI>But if you please to go with me,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To yonder House you'll welcome be.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ENCOUNTRING soon the smoaky Seat,</L>
<L>The Planter old did thus me greet,</L>
<L><HI>Whether You're come from Goal, or College,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You're Welcome, to my certain Knowlege,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And if You'll please all Night to stay,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My Son shall put You in the Way:</HI></L>
<L>Which Offer I most kindly took,</L>
<L>And for a Seat did round me look,</L>
<L>When presently among the rest</L>
<L>He plac'd his unknown <HI>English</HI> Guest,</L>
<L>Who found 'em drinking, for a Whet,</L>
<L>A Cask of Sider on the Fret:</L>
<L>'Till Supper came upon the Table,</L>
<L>On which I fed whilst I was able;</L>
<L>So after hearty Entertainment,</L>
<L>Of drink and Victuals, without Payment,</L>
<L>For Planters Tables, you must know</L>
<L>Are free for all that come and go,</L>
<L>Whilst Pone, with Milk and Mush well stor'd,</L>
<L>In wooden Dishes grac'd the Board,</L>
<L>With Hominy and Sider-Pap,</L>
<L>Which scarce an <HI>English</HI> Dog would lap,</L>
<L>Well stuff'd with Fat from Bacon fry'd,</L>
<L>And with Melasses dulcify'd.</L>
<L>Then out our Landlord pulls his Pouch,</L>
<L>As greasy as the Leather Couch</L>
<L>On which he sat, and streight begun</L>
<L>To load with Weed his <HI>Indian</HI> Gun,</L>
<L>In Length scarce longer than one's Finger,</L>
<L>Or that for which the Ladies linger.</L>
<L>His Pipe smoak'd out, with awful Grace,</L>
<L>With Aspect grave and solemn Pace,</L>
<L>The Reverend Sir, walks to a Chest,</L>
<L>Of all his Furniture the best,</L>
<L>Closely confin'd within a Room,</L>
<L>Which seldom felt the Weight of Broom:</L>
<L>From thence he lugs a Cagg of Rum,</L>
<L>And nodding to me, thus begun:</L>
<L><HI>I find,</HI> says he, <HI>you don't much care</HI></L>
<L><HI>For this our</HI> Indian <HI>Country Fare;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But let me tell you, Friend of mine,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You may be glad of it in Time,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tho' now you're Stomach is so fine;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And if within this Land you stay,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You'll find it true what I do say:</HI></L>
<L>This said, the Rundlet up he threw,</L>
<L>And bending backwards strongly drew;</L>
<L>I pluck'd as stoutly, for my Part,</L>
<L>Altho' it made me sick at Heart,</L>
<L>And got so soon into my Head,</L>
<L>I scarce could find my Way to Bed;</L>
<L>Where I was instantly convey'd,</L>
<L>By one that pass'd for Chamber-Maid,</L>
<L>Tho' by her loose and sluttish Dress,</L>
<L>She rather seem'd a <HI>Bedlam-Bess.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="003407_0021_1003EE9D09B9F5B0"/>
Curious to know from whence she came,</L>
<L>I press'd her to declare her Name?</L>
<L>She blushing, seem'd to hide her Eyes,</L>
<L>And thus in civil Terms replies:</L>
<L><HI>In better Times, o'er to this Land</HI></L>
<L><HI>I was unhappily trepann'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Perchance as well I did appear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As any Gentlewoman here,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Not then a Slave for Twice Two Year;</HI></L>
<L><HI>My Cloaths were fashionably new,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor were my Shifts of</HI> Scotch <HI>Cloth blew:</HI></L>
<L><HI>But Things are chang'd: Now at the Hoe</HI></L>
<L><HI>I daily work, and barefoot go,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In weeding Corn, and feeding Swine,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I spend my melancholly Time;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Kidnapp'd and fool'd, I hither fled,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To shun a hated Nuptial Bed;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And, to my Grief, already find</HI></L>
<L><HI>Worse Plagues than those I left behind.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHATE'ER the Wand'rer did profess,</L>
<L>Good faith I cou'd not chuse but guess</L>
<L>The Cause which brought her to this Place,</L>
<L>Was Supping e're the Priest said Grace:</L>
<L>Quick as my Thoughts the Slave was fled,</L>
<L>Her Candle left to shew my Bed,</L>
<L>Which, made of Feathers soft and good,</L>
<L>Close in the Chimney-corner stood:</L>
<L>I laid me down, expecting Rest,</L>
<L>To be in Golden Slumbers blest;</L>
<L>But soon a Noise disturb'd my Quiet,</L>
<L>And plagu'd me with Nocturnal Riot:</L>
<L>A Puss, which in the Ashes lay,</L>
<L>With grunting Pig, began a Fray,</L>
<L>And prudent Dog, that Feuds might cease,</L>
<L>Most sharply bark'd, to keep the Peace:</L>
<L>This Quarrel scarcely was decided</L>
<L>By Stick, that ready lay provided,</L>
<L>But <HI>Reynard,</HI> arch and cunning Loon,</L>
<L>Crept into my Apartment soon,</L>
<L>In hot Pursuit of Ducks and Geese,</L>
<L>With full Intent the same to seize;</L>
<L>Their cackling Plaints with strange Surprise</L>
<L>Chac'd Sleep's thick Vapours from my Eyes;</L>
<L>Raging, I jump'd upon the Floor,</L>
<L>And like a drunken Sailor swore,</L>
<L>With Sword I fiercely laid about,</L>
<L>And soon dispers'd the feather'd Rout,</L>
<L>The Poultry out of Window flew,</L>
<L>And <HI>Reynard</HI> cautiously withdrew;</L>
<L>The Dogs who this Encounter heard,</L>
<L>Fiercely themselves to aid me rear'd,</L>
<L>And to the Place of Combat run,</L>
<L>Exactly as the Field was won,</L>
<L>Fretting and hot as roasted Capon,</L>
<L>And greasy as a Flitch of Bacon.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I to the Orchard did repair,</L>
<L>To breathe the cool and open Air,</L>
<L>Impatient waiting for bright Day,</L>
<L>Extended on a Bank I lay;</L>
<L>But Fortune here, that sawey Whore,</L>
<L>Disturb'd me worse, and plagu'd me more</L>
<L>Than she had done the Night before;</L>
<L>Hoarse croaking Frogs did round me ring,</L>
<L>Such Peals the Dead to Life wou'd bring,</L>
<L>A Noise might move their Wooden King:</L>
<L>I stuff'd my Ears with Cotton white,</L>
<L>And curs'd the melancholly Night,</L>
<L>For fear of being deaf outright:</L>
<L>But soon my Vows I did recant,</L>
<L>And <HI>Hearing</HI> as a Blessing grant,</L>
<L>When a confounded <HI>Rattle-Snake</HI></L>
<L>With Hissing made my Heart to ach,</L>
<L>Not knowing how to fly the Foe,</L>
<L>Or whither in the dark to go,</L>
<L>By strange good Luck I took a Tree,</L>
<L>Prepar'd by Fate to set me free,</L>
<L>Where, riding on a Limb astride,</L>
<L>Night and the Branches did me hide,</L>
<L>And I the De'el and Snake defy'd.</L>
<L>Not yet from Plagues exempted quite,</L>
<L>The curs'd <HI>Muschetoes</HI> did me bite;</L>
<L>'Til rising Morn, and blushing Day,</L>
<L>Drove both my Fears and Ills away,</L>
<L>And from Night's Terrors set me free,</L>
<L>Discharg'd from hospitable Tree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I did to Planter's Booth repair,</L>
<L>And there at Breakfast nobly fare,</L>
<L>On Rasher broil'd, of infant Bear:</L>
<L>I thought the Cubb delicious Meat,</L>
<L>Which ne'er did ought but Chesnuts eat,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="003407_0022_1003ED3774E67EE8"/>
Nor was young <HI>Orson</HI>'s Flesh the worse,</L>
<L>Because he suck'd a <HI>Pagan</HI> Nurse:</L>
<L>Our Breakfast done, the Planter stout,</L>
<L>Handed a Glass of Rum about.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>PLEAS'D with the Treatment I did find,</L>
<L>I took my Leave of Host so kind,</L>
<L>Who, to oblige me, did provide</L>
<L>His eldest Son to be my Guide;</L>
<L>And lent me Horses of his own,</L>
<L>A skittish Colt and aged Roan,</L>
<L>The four legg'd Prop of his Wife <HI>Joan.</HI></L>
<L>Steering our Course in Trott or Pace,</L>
<L>We sail'd directly for a Place,</L>
<L>In <HI>MARYLAND</HI> of high Renown;</L>
<L>Known by the Name of <HI>Battle-Town:</HI></L>
<L>To view the Crowds did there resort,</L>
<L>Which Justice made, and Law, their Sport,</L>
<L>In their Sagacious County Court:</L>
<L>Scarce had we enter'd on the Way,</L>
<L>Which thro' the Woods and Marshes lay,</L>
<L>But <HI>Indian</HI> strange did soon appear</L>
<L>In hot Pursuit of wounded Deer;</L>
<L>No mortal Creature can express</L>
<L>His wild fantastick Air and Dress;</L>
<L>His painted Skin, in Colours dy'd,</L>
<L>His sable Hair, in Satchel ty'd,</L>
<L>Show'd <HI>Salvages</HI> not free from Pride:</L>
<L>His tawny Thinghs and Bosom bare,</L>
<L>Disdain'd an useless Coat to wear,</L>
<L>Scorn'd Summers Heat and Winters Air;</L>
<L>His manly Shoulders, such as please</L>
<L>Widows and Wives, were bath'd with Grease,</L>
<L>Of Cub and Bear, whose supple Oil,</L>
<L>Prepar'd his Limbs in Heat and Toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS naked <HI>Pict</HI> in Battle fought,</L>
<L>Or undisguis'd his Mistress sought;</L>
<L>And knowing well his Ware was good,</L>
<L>Refus'd to skreen it with a Hood:</L>
<L>His Visage Dun, and Chin that near</L>
<L>Did Razor feel, nor Scissars bear,</L>
<L>Or know the Ornament of Hair,</L>
<L>Look'd sternly grim; supriz'd with Fear,</L>
<L>I spurr'd my Horse as he drew near;</L>
<L>But Roan, who better knew than I,</L>
<L>The little Cause I had to fly,</L>
<L>Seem'd by his solemn Steps and Pace,</L>
<L>Resolv'd I shou'd the Spector face,</L>
<L>Nor faster mov'd, tho' spurr'd and prick'd,</L>
<L>Than <HI>Balam</HI>'s Ass by Prophet kick'd;</L>
<L><HI>Kekicnatop,</HI> the <HI>Heathen</HI> cry'd,</L>
<L>How is it <HI>Tom,</HI> my Friend reply'd;</L>
<L>Judging from thence, the Brute was civil,</L>
<L>I boldly fac'd the courteous Devil,</L>
<L>And lugging out a Dram of Rum,</L>
<L>I gave his tawny Worship some;</L>
<L>Who in his Language as I guess,</L>
<L>My Guide informing me no less,</L>
<L>Implor'd the Devil me to bless:</L>
<L>I thank'd him for his good Intent,</L>
<L>And forward on my Journey went;</L>
<L>Discoursing as along I rode,</L>
<L>Whether this Race was fram'd of GOD,</L>
<L>Or whether some malignant Power,</L>
<L>Had fram'd them in an evil Hour,</L>
<L>And from his own infernal Look,</L>
<L>Their dusky Form and Image took.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FROM hence we fell to Argument</L>
<L>Whence peopl'd was this Continent?</L>
<L>My Friend suppos'd <HI>Tartarians</HI> wild,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Chinese,</HI> from their home exil'd,</L>
<L>Wandring thro' Mountains hid with Snow,</L>
<L>And Rills that in the Valleys flow,</L>
<L>Far to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI></L>
<L>Broke thro' the Bars which Nature cast,</L>
<L>And wide unbeaten Regions past;</L>
<L>'Till near those Streams the human Deluge roll'd,</L>
<L>Which sparkling shin'd with glittering Sands of Gold;</L>
<L>And fetch'd <HI>Pisarro</HI> from th' <HI>Iberian</HI> Shore</L>
<L>To rob the <HI>Indians</HI> of their native Store.</L>

<L>I smil'd to hear my young Logician,</L>

<L>Had got, at Mother, <HI>Cambridge</HI> Learning;</L>
<L>Where lubber Youth just free from Birch,</L>

And in Obedience to the College,</L>
<L>Had pleas'd himself with carnal Knowledge;</L>
<L>And tho' I lik'd the Younster's Wit,</L>
<L>I judg'd the Truth he had not hit;</L>
<L>And could not chuse but smile to think,</L>
<L>What they cou'd do for Meat and Drink,</L>
<L>Who o'er so many Desarts ran,</L>
<L>With Brats and Wives in Carravan;</L>
<L>Unless perchance they'd got a Trick,</L>
<L>To eat no more than Porker sick,</L>
<L>Or could with well-contented Maws,</L>
<L>Quarter like Bears upon their Paws:</L>
<L>Thinking his Reason to confute,</L>
<L>I gravely thus commenc'd Dispute;</L>
<L>And urg'd, that tho' a <HI>Chinese</HI> Host</L>
<L>Might penetrate this <HI>Indian</HI> Coast,</L>
<L>Yet this was certainly most true,</L>
<L>They never could the Isles subdue;</L>
<L>For knowing not to steer a Boat,</L>
<L>They could not on the Ocean float,</L>
<L>Or plant their Sun-burnt Colonies,</L>

<L>'Till by the Winds and Tempests tore,</L>
<L>From their intended golden Shore,</L>
<L>They suffer'd Shipwreck, or were drown'd,</L>

<L>And vows he'd burn for it at Stake,</L>
<L>That Man may GOD his Maker make;</L>
<L>The other smiles at his Religion,</L>
<L>And vows he's but a learned Widgeon,</L>
<L>And when they've emptied all their Store,</L>
<L>From Books and Father, are not more</L>
<L>Convinc'd, or wiser than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SCARCE had we finish'd serious Story,</L>
<L>But I espy'd the Town before me;</L>
<L>And roaring Planters on the Ground,</L>
<L>Drinking of Healths, in Circle round;</L>
<L>Dismounting Steed with friendly Guide,</L>
<L>Our Horses to a Tree we ty'd,</L>
<L>And forward pass'd amongst the Rout,</L>
<L>To chuse convenient Quarters out;</L>
<L>But being none were to be found,</L>
<L>We sat like others on the Ground,</L>
<L>Carousing Punch in open Air,</L>
<L>'Till Cryer did the Court declare:</L>
<L>The planting Rabble being met,</L>
<L>Their drunken Worships likewise fat,</L>
<L>Cryer proclaims the Noise shou'd cease,</L>
<L>And streight the Lawyers broke the Peace,</L>
<L>Wrangling for Plantiff and Defendant,</L>
<L>I thought they ne'r wou'd make an End on't,</L>
<L>With Nonsence, Stuff, and false Quotations,</L>
<L>With brazen Lies, and Allegations;</L>
<L>And in the Splitting of the Cause,</L>
<L>Us'd such strange Motions with their Paws,</L>
<L>As shew'd their Zeal was rather bent</L>
<L>In Blows to end the Argument.</L>
<L>A Reverend Judge, who to the Shame,</L>
<L>Of all the Bench, cou'd write his Name,</L>
<L>At Petty-Fogger took Offence,</L>
<L>And wonder'd at his Impudence:</L>
<L>My Neighbour <HI>Dash,</HI> with Scorn replies,</L>
<L>And in the Face of Justice flies;</L>
<L>The Bench in Fury streight divide,</L>
<L>And Scribles take on Judge's Side;</L>
<L>The Jury, Lawyers, and their Clients,</L>
<L>Contending, fight, like Earth-born Giants,</L>
<L>'Till Sh'riff that slily lay perdue,</L>
<L>Hoping Indictments would ensue;</L>
<L>And when—</L>
<L>A Hat or Wig fell in the Way,</L>
<L>He seiz'd 'em for the Queen, as Stray;</L>
<L>The Court adjourn'd in usual Manner,</L>
<L>In Battle, Blood, and fractious Clamour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="22" REF="003407_0024_1003ED3C806A04A0"/>
<L>I thought it proper to provide.</L>
<L>A Lodging for my self and Guide;</L>
<L>So to our Inn we march'd away,</L>
<L>Which at a little Distance lay;</L>
<L>Where all Things were in such Consusion,</L>
<L>I thought the World at it's Conclusion;</L>
<L>A Heard of Planters on the Ground,</L>
<L>O'rewhelm'd with Punch, dead Drunk we found;</L>
<L>Others were fighting and contending,</L>
<L>Some burn'd their Cloaths, to save the mend∣ing;</L>
<L>A few whose Heads, by frequent Use,</L>
<L>Could better bear the potent Juice,</L>
<L>Gravely debated State Affairs,</L>
<L>Whilst I most nimbly tripp'd up Stairs,</L>
<L>Leaving my Friend discoursing oddly,</L>
<L>And mixing Things Prophane and Godly;</L>
<L>Just then beginning to be drunk,</L>
<L>As from the Company I slunk:</L>
<L>To every Room and Nook I crept,</L>
<L>In hopes I might have somewhere slept;</L>
<L>But all the Beding was possest,</L>
<L>By one or other drunken Guest;</L>
<L>But after looking long about,</L>
<L>I found an antient Corn-loft out;</L>
<L>Glad that I might in Quiet sleep,</L>
<L>And there my Bones unfractur'd keep:</L>
<L>I laid me down secur'd from Fray,</L>
<L>And soundly snor'd 'till break o'Day;</L>
<L>When waking fresh, I sat upright,</L>
<L>And found my Shoes were vanish'd quite,</L>
<L>Hat, Wig, and Stockings, all were fled,</L>
<L>From this extended <HI>Indian</HI> Bed:</L>
<L>Vex'd at the Loss of Goods and Chattle,</L>
<L>I swore I'd give the Rascal Battle,</L>
<L>Who had abus'd me in this Sort,</L>
<L>And Merchant-Stranger made his Sport:</L>
<L>I furiously descended Ladder,</L>
<L>No Hare in <HI>March</HI> was ever madder,</L>
<L>And did with Host and Servants quarrel,</L>
<L>But all in vain, for my Apparel;</L>
<L>For one whose Mind did much aspire</L>
<L>To Mischief, threw them in the Fire.</L>
<L>Equipp'd with neither Hat nor Shoe,</L>
<L>I did my coming hither rue,</L>
<L>And doubtful thoughts what I should do:</L>
<L>When looking round I saw my Friend,</L>
<L>Lye naked on a Table's End,</L>
<L>A Sight so dismal to behold,</L>
<L>One would have thought him dead and cold,</L>
<L>There ready laid, to be next Day</L>
<L>On Shoulders Four convey'd away:</L>
<L>'Till wringing of his bloody Nose,</L>
<L>By fighting got, we may suppose,</L>
<L>I found him not so fast asleep,</L>
<L>Might give his Friends some cause to weep:</L>
<L>Rise <HI>Oronoko,</HI> rise, said I,</L>
<L>And from this <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Bedlam</HI> fly:</L>
<L>My Guide starts up, and in a Maze,</L>
<L>With Bloodshot Eyes did round him gaze,</L>
<L>At Lenth with many Sigh and Groan,</L>
<L>He went in search of aged Roan;</L>
<L>But Roan who seldom us'd to falter,</L>
<L>Had fairly this Time slipt his Halter,</L>
<L>And not content all Night to stay,</L>
<L>Ty'd up from Fodder, run away;</L>
<L>After my Guide to catch him ran,</L>
<L>And so I lost both Horse and Man;</L>
<L>Which Disappointment tho' so great,</L>
<L>Did only Jest and Mirth create:</L>
<L>'Till one more civil than the rest,</L>
<L>In Conversation far the best,</L>
<L>Observing that for want of Roan,</L>
<L>I shou'd be left to walk alone,</L>
<L>Most readily did me intreat,</L>
<L>To take a Bottle at his Seat,</L>
<L>A Favour at that Time so great,</L>
<L>I blest my kind propitious Fate;</L>
<L>And finding soon a fresh Supply</L>
<L>Of Cloaths, from Store-House kept hard by,</L>
<L>I mounted streight on such a Steed,</L>
<L>Did rather Curb than Whipping need;</L>
<L>And straining at the usual Rate,</L>
<L>With Spur of Punch which lies in Pate,</L>
<L>E'er long we lighted at the Gate;</L>
<L>Where in an antient Cedar-House,</L>
<L>Dwelt my new Friend, a <HI>Cockerouse,</HI></L>
<L>Whose Fabrick, tho' 'twas built of Wood,</L>
<L>Had many Springs and Winters stood:</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="003407_0025_1003EEA369E88400"/>
When sturdy Oaks and lofty Pines,</L>
<L>Were levell'd with Musk-Melon-Vines,</L>
<L>And Plants eradicated were,</L>
<L>By Hurricans drove in the Air:</L>
<L>There with good Punch and Apple Juice,</L>
<L>We spent our Time without Abuse,</L>
<L>'Till Midnight in her sable Vest,</L>
<L>Persuaded Gods and Men to rest;</L>
<L>And with a pleasing kind Surprize,</L>
<L>Indulg'd soft Slumber to my Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FIERCE <HI>Aethon,</HI> Courser of the Sun,</L>
<L>Had half his Race exactly Run,</L>
<L>And breath'd on me a furious Ray,</L>
<L>Darting hot Beams the following Day,</L>
<L>When Rug in Blanket white, I lay;</L>
<L>But Heat and Chinces rais'd the Sinner,</L>
<L>Most opportunely to his Dinner;</L>
<L>Wild Fowl and Fish delicious Meats,</L>
<L>As good as <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Doxy eats,</L>
<L>Began our hospitable Chear,</L>
<L>Fat Venison follow'd in the Rear,</L>
<L>And Turkeys wild, luxurious Fare:</L>
<L>But what the Feast did most commend,</L>
<L>Was hearty Welcome from my Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS having made a noble Feast,</L>
<L>I eat as well as pamper'd Priest;</L>
<L><HI>Madera</HI> strong in flowing Bowles,</L>
<L>Fill'd with extreme Delight our Souls;</L>
<L>'Till wearied with a purple Flood,</L>
<L>Of gen'rous Wine, the Giants Blood,</L>
<L>As Poets feign, away I made</L>
<L>For some refreshing verdant Shade;</L>
<L>Where musing on my Rambles strange,</L>
<L>And Fortune, which so oft did change,</L>
<L>In midst of various Contemplations,</L>
<L>Of Fancies odd and Meditations,</L>
<L>I slumber'd long, —</L>
<L>'Till airy Night and noxious Dews,</L>
<L>Did Sleep's unwholsome Fetters loose,</L>
<L>With Vapours cold and misty Air,</L>
<L>To Fire-side I did repair;</L>
<L>Near which a jolly Female Crew,</L>
<L>Were deep engag'd at <HI>Lanterloo,</HI></L>
<L>In Nightrails white, with dirty Mien,</L>
<L>Such Sights are scarce in <HI>England</HI> seen;</L>
<L>I thought them first some Witches, bent</L>
<L>On black Designs, in dire Convent;</L>
<L>'Till one who with affected Air,</L>
<L>Had nicely learn'd to Curse and Swear,</L>
<L>Cry'd, <HI>Dealing's lost, 'tis but a Flam,</HI></L>
<L>And vow'd by G— <HI>she'd have her Pam:</HI></L>
<L>When Dealing thro' the Board had run,</L>
<L>They ask'd me kindly, <HI>to make one:</HI></L>
<L>Not staying often to be bid,</L>
<L>I sate me down as others did;</L>
<L>We scarce had play'd a Round about,</L>
<L>But that those <HI>Indian</HI> Frows fell out:</L>
<L><HI>D—m you,</HI> says one, <HI>tho' now so Brave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I knew you late a Four Years Slave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>What, if for Planter's Wife you go,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nature design'd you for the Hoe:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Rot you,</HI> replies the other streight,</L>
<L><HI>The Captain kiss'd you for his Freight;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And if the Truth was known aright,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And how you walk'd the Streets by Night,</HI></L>
<L><HI>You'd blush, if one could blush for Shame,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who from</HI> Bridewell <HI>and</HI> Newgate <HI>came.</HI></L>
<L>From Words they fairly fell to Blows,</L>
<L>And being loth to interpose,</L>
<L>Or meddle in the Wars of Punk,</L>
<L>Away to Bed in Haste I slunk:</L>
<L>Waking next Day with aking Head,</L>
<L>And Thirst that made me quit the Bed,</L>
<L>I rigg'd my self and soon got up,</L>
<L>To cool my Liver with a Cup</L>
<L>Of <HI>Succahanah</HI> fresh and clear,</L>
<L>Not half so good as <HI>English</HI> Beer,</L>
<L>Which ready stood in Kitchin Pail,</L>
<L>And was, in Fact, but <HI>Adam</HI>'s Ale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR Planters Cellars, you must know,</L>
<L>Seldom with good <HI>October</HI> flow,</L>
<L>But Perry, Quince, and Apple Juice,</L>
<L>Spout from the Tap, like any Sluice,</L>
<L>Until the Cask grows low and stale,</L>
<L>They're forc'd again to Goard and Pail,</L>
<L>The soothing Draught scarce down my Throat,</L>
<L>Enough to set a Ship on float,</L>
<L>With <HI>Cockerouse</HI> as I was sitting</L>
<L>I felt a Fever intermitting,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="003407_0026_1003EEAC5EB4D318"/>
A fiery Pulse beat in my Veins,</L>
<L>From cold I felt resembling Pains;</L>
<L>This cursed Seasoning I remember,</L>
<L>Lasted from <HI>March</HI> 'till cold <HI>December;</HI></L>
<L>Nor could it then it's Quarter shift,</L>
<L>Until by <HI>Carduus</HI> turn'd adrift:</L>
<L>And had my Doct'ress wanted Skill,</L>
<L>Or Kitchin-Phisick at her Will,</L>
<L>My Father's Son had lost his Lands,</L>
<L>And never seen the <HI>Goodwin Sands:</HI></L>
<L>But Thanks to <HI>Fortune,</HI> and a Nurse,</L>
<L>Whose Care depended on my Purse,</L>
<L>I saw my self in good Condition,</L>
<L>Without the Help of a Phisician:</L>
<L>At length the shivering Ill reliev'd</L>
<L>My Heart and Head, which long had griev'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I then began to think with Care,</L>
<L>How I might sell my <HI>British</HI> Ware;</L>
<L>That with my Freight I might comply,</L>
<L>Did on my Charter-Party lye:</L>
<L>To this Intent, with Guide before,</L>
<L>I tript it to the <HI>Eastern</HI> Shore;</L>
<L>Where riding near a Sandy Bay,</L>
<L>I met a Planter in my Way,</L>
<L>A pious, consciencious Rogue,</L>
<L>As e're wore Bonnet, Hat, or Brogue,</L>
<L>Who neither swore, nor kept his Word,</L>
<L>But cheated in the Fear o' th' Lord;</L>
<L>And when his Debts he could not pay,</L>
<L>From trusting Fools he'd run away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH this sly Zealot, soon I struck</L>
<L>A Bargain, for my <HI>English</HI> Truck,</L>
<L>Agreeing for Ten Thousand Weight</L>
<L>Of <HI>Sotweed</HI> good, and fit for Freight:</L>
<L>Broad <HI>Oronoko,</HI> bright and sound,</L>
<L>The Growth and Product of his Ground;</L>
<L>In Cask, that shou'd contain compleat</L>
<L>Five Hundred of Tobacco neat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Contract thus betwixt us made,</L>
<L>Not well acquainted with the Trade,</L>
<L>My Goods I trusted to the Cheat,</L>
<L>Whose Crop was then o'board the Fleet;</L>
<L>And going to receive my own,</L>
<L>I found the Bird was newly flown:</L>
<L>Cursing this execrable Slave,</L>
<L>This damn'd pretended Godly Knave,</L>
<L>On due Revenge and Justice bent,</L>
<L>I instantly to Council went;</L>
<L>Unto an ambodexter Quack,</L>
<L>Who learnedly had got the Knack</L>
<L>Of giving Clysters, making Pills,</L>
<L>Of filling Bonds, and forging Wills;</L>
<L>And with a Stock of Impudence,</L>
<L>Supply'd his want of Wit and Sence,</L>
<L>With Looks demure, amazing People,</L>
<L>No wiser than a Daw on Steeple</L>
<L>My Anger flushing in my Face,</L>
<L>I stated the preceeding Case,</L>
<L>And of my Money was so free</L>
<L>That he'd have poison'd you or me,</L>
<L>And hang'd his Father on a Tree,</L>
<L>For such another tempting Fee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SMILING, said he, the Cause is clear,</L>
<L>I'll manage him, you need not fear,</L>
<L>The Case is judg'd, good Sir, but look</L>
<L>In <HI>Galen,</HI> no, in my Lord <HI>Cook,</HI></L>
<L>I vow to G-d, I was mistook:</L>
<L>I'll take out a Provincial Writ,</L>
<L>And trownce him for his knavish Wit,</L>
<L>Upon my Life, I'll win the Cause,</L>
<L>With as much Ease I cure the Yaws:</L>
<L>Resolv'd to plague the Holy Brother,</L>
<L>I set one Rogue to catch another.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TO try the Cause then fully bent,</L>
<L>Up to <HI>Annapolis</HI> I went,</L>
<L>A City situate on a Plain,</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Account of <HI>Annapolis</HI> was given Twenty Years ago, and does not resemble it's present State.</NOTE> Where scarce a House will keep out Rain;</L>
<L>The Buildings fram'd with Cypress rare,</L>
<L>Resembles much our <HI>Southwark-Fair;</HI></L>
<L>But Strangers there will scarcely meet,</L>
<L>With Market Place, Exchange, or Street;</L>
<L>And if the Truth I may report,</L>
<L>It's not so large as <HI>Tottenham-Court.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="003407_0027_1003EEAE2E38A828"/>
St. <HI>Mary's</HI> once was in Repute,</L>
<L>Now Here the Judges try the Suit,</L>
<L>And Lawyers twice a Year dispute.</L>
<L>As oft the Bench most gravely meet,</L>
<L>Some to get drink, and some to eat</L>
<L>A swinging Share of Country Treat:</L>
<L>But as for Justice write or wrong,</L>
<L>Not one amongst the numerous Throng</L>
<L>Knows what it means, or has the Heart,</L>
<L>To vindicate a Stranger's Part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW, Court being call'd by beat of Drum,</L>
<L>The Judges left their Punch and Rum;</L>
<L>When Pettifogging Doctor draws</L>
<L>His Papers forth, and opens Cause;</L>
<L>And lest I should the Better get,</L>
<L>Brib'd Quack suppress'd his knavish Wit:</L>
<L>So Maid upon the downy Field,</L>
<L>Pretends a Rape, and fights to yield:</L>
<L>The byass'd Court without Delay,</L>
<L>Adjudg'd my Debt in Country Pay,</L>
<L>In Pipe Staves,-Corn, or Flesh of Boar,</L>
<L>Rare Cargo for the <HI>English</HI> Shore.</L>
<L>Raging with Grief, full Speed I ran,</L>
<L>To join the Fleet at <HI>Kickatan:</HI></L>
<L>And while I waited for a Wind,</L>
<L>This Wish proceeded from my Mind,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>IF any Youngster cross the Ocean,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To sell his Wares—may he with Caution</HI></L>
<L><HI>Before he pays, receive each Hogshead,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lest he be cheated by some Dogshead,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Both of his Goods and his Tobacco;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And then like me, be shall not lack-woe.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>AND may that Land where Hospitality,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is every Planter's darling Quality,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Be by each Trader kindly us'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And may no Trader be abus'd;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then each of them shall deal with Pleasure,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And each encrease the other's Treasure.</HI></L>
