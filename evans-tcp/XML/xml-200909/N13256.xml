<HEAD>THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LET martial souls, whom wild ambition warms,</L>
<L>The trumpet's clangor, and rude din of arms,</L>
<L>Point out the path victorious heroes trod,</L>
<L>The pest of nations, and the scourge of God:</L>
<L>Mine be the task, in humbler verse to trace</L>
<L>The <HI>real</HI> greatness of the human race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' rude and savage Afric's sons we find,</L>
<L>Yet there first Science dawn'd upon mankind,</L>
<L>There curb'd the passions in perpetual strife,</L>
<L>And there begat the softer arts of life.</L>
<L>Blest by kind nature with a gen'rous soil,</L>
<L>That yielded herbage, tho' not dress'd with toil,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="016759_0004_0F9DEF3930079FB0"/>In philosophic ease they pass'd their years,</L>
<L>And watch'd the motions of the rolling Spheres.</L>
<L>Their modest wants plain Nature could redress,</L>
<L>And Science gave them rural happiness.</L>
<L>Egypt beheld her twilight's fainter ray,</L>
<L>And form'd fond hopes of her meridian day;</L>
<L>When, lo! tyrannic rage usurp'd the whole,</L>
<L>And cramp'd with fetters each high swelling soul.</L>
<L>Disorder'd fancy superstition bred;</L>
<L>She clap'd her wings, and thought her foe was dead;</L>
<L>Yet she but fled, to gain in happy Greece,</L>
<L>What Egypt had deny'd her, rural peace.</L>
<L>The Grecian souls, form'd of the subtlest kind,</L>
<L>In Freedom nurtur'd, strength'ned and refin'd,</L>
<L>Quick catch'd the flame; it ran from soul to soul,</L>
<L>And like electric fire, inspir'd the whole.</L>
<L>Here Poets sang, and Rhetoricians plead,</L>
<L>Here Statesmen sat, and patriot Worthies bled.</L>
<L>Ah blindness to the future! headlong toss'd,</L>
<L>They grasp'd the shadow, but the substance lost.</L>
<L>Greece led her armies Troy's high walls to rase;</L>
<L>The city shook and totter'd to its base,</L>
<L>At length it fell—but from its ruins rose</L>
<L>A vagrant band to subjugate their foes.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="016759_0005_0F9DEF39EFBB4CA0"/>Imperial Rome, the mistress of the world,</L>
<L>Towns, cities, kingdoms into ruin hurl'd,</L>
<L>And reign'd supreme alone. Greece felt her force,</L>
<L>Nor stem'd the torrent in its rapid course;</L>
<L>All victims fell to its resistless rage,</L>
<L>The rough Barbarian, and the Grecian Sage.</L>
<L>Ardent the Romans Grecian science view'd,</L>
<L>Nor scorn'd to learn of those they had subdu'd;</L>
<L>They reach'd the same sublimity of thought,</L>
<L>And those, who learned, equal'd those, who taught.</L>
<L>There godlike Homer rear'd his awful head,</L>
<L>Here Virgil sang, and here great Tully plead.</L>
<L>As when some mighty torrent, swol'n with rain,</L>
<L>Falls rushing, dashing, 'till it meets the plain,</L>
<L>O'er craggy rocks bends its resistless force,</L>
<L>From clift to clift loud thund'ring in its course;</L>
<L>So did the Athenian patriotic rave,</L>
<L>And taught his country to be nobly brave.</L>
<L>Not so the Roman. As the ancient Nile</L>
<L>Glides smoothly on within its banks a while,</L>
<L>Slow, gradual, rising, then o'erspeads the plain,</L>
<L>And adds all Egypt to the swelling main;</L>
<L>So syren Tully onward gently rolls,</L>
<L>Enchants, enraptures, and subdues our souls.</L>

<L>Behold far north the gath'ring tempest rise,</L>
<L>Rushing impetuous, as the whirlwind flies;</L>
<L>Towns, cities, kingdoms from their basis fall,</L>
<L>And one wide ruin overwhelms them all.</L>
<L>Eternal Rome sinks to the common grave,</L>
<L>Bursts, like a bubble dancing on the wave,</L>
<L>Flies off in smoke, and rules the world no more—</L>
<L>Oh! blush then, earthly grandeur! pageant power!</L>
<L>Age after age in one sad tenor ran,</L>
<L>A blank—a chasm in the page of man.</L>
<L>Men drudg'd their labour'd dulness to rehearse,</L>
<L>To form an anagram, or egg in verse;</L>
<L>They stifled genius with pedantic rules,</L>
<L>And labour'd hard to prove that—they were fools.</L>
<L>No mighty task, tho' labour'd in so long,</L>
<L>Each line was proof, was demonstration strong;</L>
<L>And men, Oh dulness to perfection brought!</L>
<L>Blush'd to be guilty of a noble thought.</L>
<L>Yet in this gloom did Roger Bacon rise,</L>
<L>Like lightning flashing thro' the clouded skies,</L>
<L>He burst the barrier of pedantic rules,</L>
<L>And all the labour'd jargon of the schools.</L>
<L>As forked lightnings, with their hasty light,</L>
<L>Serve but to shew the horrors of the night;</L>
<L>So he but shew'd the dulness of the age,</L>
<L>A stain—a blot upon historic page.</L>

<L>As when cold Zembla, wrapt in darkest shade,</L>
<L>First sees the Sun erect his radiant head,</L>
<L>In gratitude to the benignant power,</L>
<L>They gather round and Persian-like adore;</L>
<L>He gives them light, not only light, but heat;</L>
<L>Warms with new life, and makes that life compleat;</L>
<L>Th' expanding blossoms smile on every clod,</L>
<L>And laughing vallies own the present God;</L>
<L>Loud hymns of praise the feather'd tribes employ,</L>
<L>And savage beasts howl their tremendous joy;</L>
<L>A second Bacon thus divine appear'd,</L>
<L>Took hoary dulness by his grisly beard,</L>
<L>Shook the grim tyrant first, then headlong hurl'd,</L>
<L>And reinstated Science in the world.</L>
<L>Hence brilliant worthies our attention claim,</L>
<L>Who grace the annals of Britannia's fame.</L>
<L>While sun, or moon, or planetary spheres,</L>
<L>Traverse the circle of revolving years;</L>
<L>While nature's laws exist, great Newton's name</L>
<L>Shall stand the foremost on the list of fame.</L>
<L>He saw creation in her mystic dance,</L>
<L>By order govern'd, not by devious chance;</L>
<L>He trac'd the planets thro' their mazy road,</L>
<L>Caught wand'ring comets in their dark abode,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="016759_0008_0F9DEF3C40786068"/>Explor'd great nature's universal chain,</L>
<L>Hung earth self-ballanc'd in the vast inane,</L>
<L>Unfolded the philosophy of light,</L>
<L>Taught us why this is black, why that is white,</L>
<L>Taught us why bodies are so prone to fall,</L>
<L>What heaves old ocean, and unravell'd all</L>
<L>This riddle of creation.—</L>
<L>To reach his merit I can never hope,</L>
<L>Then take his euge in the words of Pope.</L>
<L>"Superior beings, when of late they faw</L>
<L>"A mortal man unfold all nature's law,</L>
<L>"Admir'd such wisdom in all earthly shape,</L>
<L>"And shew'd a Newton as we shew an ape."</L>
<L>Thee, tuneful Pope, with equal praise they show,</L>
<L>Whose noble thoughts in strains, harmonious flow.</L>
<L>Hail! Shakespear, hail! We feel thy force divine,</L>
<L>Feel nature's pathos live in ev'ry line.</L>
<L>Thro' distant climes shall Milton's fame be heard,</L>
<L>Our modern Homer, and sublimest bard.</L>
<L>In Metaphysics too a Locke we find,</L>
<L>Unfolding the recesses of the mind,</L>
<L>Teaching mankind the great Creator's plan;</L>
<L>Yet less admire the author than the man.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="016759_0009_0F9DEF3F6B88C680"/>Great in himself, he could with pleasure leave</L>
<L>The tinfel'd greatness that a Court can give,</L>
<L>Refuse a place—a pension, and retire</L>
<L>From glitt'ring pomp, to fan celestial fire.</L>
<L>Nor Britain only can her worthies boast;</L>
<L>They rise in crouds throughout all Europe's coast.</L>
<L>E'en this far western world can boast a few;</L>
<L>We've had a Franklin, and a Winthrop too.</L>
<L>Ah! Winthrop's dead—Then o'er his sacred hearse</L>
<L>Pay the sad tribute of elegiac verse</L>
<L>Yet wherefore grieve? To Winthrop now 'tis giv'n,</L>
<L>Not to survey, but to inhabit Heav'n</L>
<L>Eccentric souls, great as himself shall rise,</L>
<L>Spring loose from Earth, and emulate the skies.</L>
<L>For see, in Europe Science reigns no more,</L>
<L>Their souls are fetter'd with tyrannic power.</L>
<L>Tiptoe she stands on Europe's utmost verge,</L>
<L>With wing high-hovering o'er the foaming surge;</L>
<L>See her in air her form majestic raise,</L>
<L>See placid ocean motionless to gaze</L>
<L>See clumsy whales in awkward measures play,</L>
<L>And the mild radiance of her gladsom day</L>
<L>Tremble upon the wide extended plain,</L>
<L>And adoration universal reign.</L>

<L>Hail, beauteous Goddess! here erect thy seat,</L>
<L>Let infant Harvard be thy fam'd retreat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All hail, ye Worthies, who with gen'rous views</L>
<L>Nurture this Dwelling for the tuneful Muse.</L>
<L>When the Supreme in that tremendous day</L>
<L>Shall from creation wipe this spot of clay;</L>
<L>When the dread mandate shall in Heav'n be pass'd,</L>
<L>And Nature in convulsions groan her last;</L>
<L>When liquid flames in molten columns rise,</L>
<L>And the swift Cherub thro' our system flies,</L>
<L>Blows out yon taper in his mighty power,</L>
<L>And swears that "time on earth shall be no more;"</L>
<L>Then shall a Hollis, then a Hancock rise,</L>
<L>And spring with rapture to their native skies.</L>
