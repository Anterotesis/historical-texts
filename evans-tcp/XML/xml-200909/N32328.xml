<HEAD>I. Of faith in the holy trinity.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is one God, Ephe. 4, 6, who is a spirit, John, 4, 24; he is light, and in him is no darkness at all, 1 John, 1, 5, who by the word of his power created all things for his own glory; man, in his own image, created he him male, and female, created he them, Gen. 1, 27. There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one, 1 John, 5, 7. The father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, John 10, 38. The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, chap. 15, 26, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father; and the Son and these three are one (very) God. 1 Cor. 8, 6.</P>

By this sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, Rom. 5, 12; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, chap. 3, 23; lost the image of God, and are, by nature, the chil∣dren of wrath, Ephe. 2, 3, being dead in sin, verse 1, and John 5, 25; for God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all, Rom. 11, 32.</P>

<HEAD>V. Of the condition of man after the fall; and of the new birth.</HEAD>
<P>In Adam all sinned, and come short of the glory of God, Rom. 3, 23, lost his image, and became, by nature, the children of wrath, Ephe. 2, 5, being naturally inclined to evil; so that the flesh l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>steth always contrary to the spirit, Rom. 8, 7, and chap. 7, 23, and Gal. 5, 17, and therefore every person that is naturally engendered of the offspring of Adam deserves the wrath of God, Rom. 5, 12, and chap. 6, 23. The condition of man is such that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength, and good works, to faith, Gal. 2, 16; neither can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, in his own will and strength, do good works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>asant and acceptable to God, Rom. 8, 8, wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us submit to the divine life, John 1, 4, that we

Peter 1, 23, having put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him, and which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness, Ephe. 4, 23, 24, and Col. 3, 10; these are renewed in the spirit of their minds, Ephe. 4, 23, and glory in nothing, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto them, and they unto the world, Gal. 6, 14; for in Christ Jesus, nei∣ther circumcision availeth any thing, or uncircum∣cision; but a new creature, verse 15, and chap. 5, 6.</P>

<HEAD>VI. Of the inward manifestation of Christ; and of the true guide of his children.</HEAD>
<P><Q>God dwelleth with the contrite and humble in spirit, Isai. 15, 5, 6: for he hath said he will dwell in them, and walk in them, 2 Cor. 6, 16; and Christ standeth at the door, and knocketh: If any man hear his voice, and open the door, he will come in to him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up with him, and he with him, Rev. 3, 20. This is the riches of the glory of the mystery which God would make known among (or rather) in the Gentiles, Christ within the hope of glory; Col. 1, 27: he prayed to the father, and he gave the Saints another comforter, that was to abide with them forever, even the spirit of truth, which is to be in them, John 14, 16, 17.</Q> For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God, Rom. 8, 14; for this is the covenant that God hath made with the house of Israel; he hath put his laws in their minds, and writ them in their hearts, and they are all taught of God, Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 10, 11, and the anointing which they have receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>

<P><Q>Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we, through patience, and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope, Rom. 15, 4, which are able to make wise unto sal∣vation, through faith, which is in Christ Jesus, all scripture being given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for in∣struction, in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished with all good works, 2 Timo. 3, 15, 16, 17. No prophecy of the scriptures is of any private interpretation; for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, 2 Pet. 1, 20, 21.</Q></P>

<HEAD>IX. Of the love of God to all men; and of the appearance of the true light to all, in order to their salvation.</HEAD>
<P>When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly, Rom. 5, 6. God com∣mendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners. Christ died for us, verse 8, who, by the grace of God, hath tasted death for every man, Heb. 2, 9; he gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, 1 Tim. 2, 6. He was a lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Rev. 5, 8, 12, 13. In the fulness of time he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, Heb. 9, 26, that they which live might not live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, Rom. 5, 8. He is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repent∣ance, 2 Pet. 3, 9, and receive the gospel, which is the power of God, unto salvation, to them that be∣lieve, Rom. 1, 16, which was preached to every crea∣ture under Heaven, Col. 1, 23; and if it be hid, it is hid to them which are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine into them, 2 Cor. 4, 3, 4; for this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil, John 3, 19. In Christ was life, and the life was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, chap. 1, 4, 9, by which all things that are reprovable are made manifest; for whatsoever maketh manifest is light, Ephe. 5, 13. This is the more sure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well to take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, 2 Pet. 1, 19; for God has said his spirit will not always strive with man, Gen. 6, 3, wherefore let us submit ourselves to the word of his grace, which is able to give us an inheritance among all them which are sanctified, Acts, 20, 32.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="042573_0006_101C79A4C86110B8"/>
<HEAD>X. Of the necessity of repentance; of conviction, faith, and justification.</HEAD>
<P>By one man sin entered into the world, and death∣ly sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned, Rom. 5, 12, and come short of the glory of God, chap. 3, 23, and by nature carnally minded, which is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God, Rom. 8, 7, 8, wherefore let us not grieve the holy spirit of God, but submit to his grace, Tit. 2, 11, that we may be renewed in the spirit of our minds, Ephe. 4, 23, and become the children of light, through faith, chap. 5, 8. God is light, and in him is no darkness at all, 1 John, 1, 5; the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, John, 17, 21; the Holy Ghost, pro∣ceeding from the Father and the Son, chap. 15, 26, by which all things that are reprovable are made ma∣nifest; for whatsoever maketh manifest is light, Ephe. 15, 13. As many, therefore, as do submit to the divine life, John 1, 4, which shines into them by way of reproof, verse 9, and Isai. 51, 1, 4, making mani∣fest to them what is sin, John 13, 19, 20, and Ephe. 5, 13, will be led to see the evil of sin, and feel con∣demnation for it in a higher or lower degree, behold∣ing, with the eye of the mind, that damnation is the just reward of sin, Rom. 6, 23. This all must see and feel in a greater or smaller measure, as all have sinned, chap. 5, 12. Being thus made sensible of the just reward of sin, Gal. 3, 10, they are filled with a fear that there is no mercy for them, Rom. 7, 9: This causes them to mourn over their mispent time, being grieved with their sins, Psal. 25, 11, 17; their minds are so occupied, partly through fear, and a desire to be saved, that their sleep and wordly enjoy∣ments depart from them; so that nothing is more agreeable to them than to mourn over their hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arts, Job 3, 24, crying, what must we do to be

saved? Acts 16, 31. The Lord lets them see, when they have done all they can, he is just in their dam∣nation, psal. 51, 4, and, under a sense of it being just, they are led to submit to the will of God, cry∣ing, Lord, if there is any mercy for such an one as I, let me have it; if not, thy will be done, Luke 11, 2, now they find mercy from him that said I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins, and their iniquities will I remember no more, Heb. 8, 12; they are enabled to receive the promise by faith, the burden of sin is suddenly removed, and the love of God is shed abroad in the heart, Rom. 5, 5; they find peace with God, through Jesus Christ, and they re∣joice, with joy unspeakable, and full of glory, 1 Pet. 1, 8, being justified by grace, through faith, Ephe. 2, 8, which is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen, Heb. 11, 1; they live, yet not they, but Christ liveth in them; and the life which they now live in the flesh is by the faith of the Son of God, who loved them, and gave himself for them, Gal. 2, 20.</P>

<HEAD>XI. Of perfection and good works, which are the fruits of faith; and of the final perseverance of the Saints.</HEAD>
<P>Sin shall not have dominion over such as are not under the law, but under grace, Rom. 6, 14; for there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit; for the law of the spirit of life maketh free from the law of sin and death, chap. 8, 1, 2, for such are become dead unto sin, and alive unto righteous∣ness; and, being made free from sin, become servants of righteousness, chap. 6. 2, 18. How, then, shall they that are dead to sin live any longer therein verse 2; for they delight in the law of God after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inward man, chap. 7, 22; they are his workmanshi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

This is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us com∣mandment; and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him, and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spirit which he hath given us, chap. 3, 23, 24; for as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God, Rom. 8, 14. Let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and know∣eth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love, 1 John, 4, 7; they which have be∣lieved in God are careful to maintain good works, Tit. 3, 8, for they love God, and delight in his law, Psal. 11, 9, 7, and love worketh no ill to his neigh∣bour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law, Rom. 13, 10. These are persuaded that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor heights, nor depths, nor any other creature, shall be able to sepa∣rate them from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, chap. 8, 38, 39; for God hath made a new covenant with the house of Israel, Heb. 8, 8; he has put his laws into their minds, and writ them in their hearts, and said, I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people, verse 10; he said I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins, and their iniquities, will I remember no more, verse 12.

Psal. 89, 31, 32, 33, 34; my mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him; his seed also will I make to en∣dure forever, verse 28, 29. The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord, that hath mercy on thee, Isa. 54, 10; for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God, Col. 3, 3; but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification, and re∣demption, 1 Cor. 1, 30.</P>
