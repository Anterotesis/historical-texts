<HEAD>Our <HI>Father's</HI> SINS Confessed with our Own.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Psalm CVI. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>We have sinned with our Fathers: We have committed Iniquity, we have done wickedly.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS <HI>Psalm</HI> is a <HI>History,</HI> or rather a <HI>Penitential Confession</HI> of the Rebel∣lions and Provocations of the <HI>Chil∣dren of Israel,</HI> from the day of their Departure out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> thro' all their Travels and long Sojourning in the <HI>Wilderness.</HI> In the <HI>Text</HI> the <HI>Psalmist</HI> in the Name of the People of his <HI>own Generation,</HI> confesses their Interest and share in these Sins of <HI>their Fathers and An∣cestors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We have</HI> Sinned <HI>with our Fathers:</HI> The <HI>Critics</HI> render it by <HI>Sicut</HI> and <HI>aeque;</HI> as expres∣sing the <HI>Similitude</HI> of one unto the other, or
<PB N="4" REF="001801_0003_0FB82C62E3C47E80"/>the <HI>Aggravation</HI> of the one from the other: We have done <HI>as</HI> our Fathers did before us, with <HI>equal</HI> Perversness and Rebellion. We have, <HI>added</HI> to the Stock of <HI>Hereditary Guilt,</HI> and fill'd up the Measure of their Iniquity. Not only have sinned in their <HI>loins,</HI> being the Children and Posterity of wicked Ancestors; but we have been our selves a disobedient, Impenitent, and sometimes <HI>Idolatrous</HI> People, after the <HI>Similitude</HI> of their Transgressions. We have sinned <HI>like</HI> them, by whose <HI>Example,</HI> Sins and Sufferings we should have <HI>taken War∣ning.</HI></P>
<P>THIS seems to be the Meaning of the <HI>Confession</HI> in the <HI>Text,</HI> and so they <HI>Aggravate</HI> on their own Iniquities in deep Humiliation, by <HI>calling to Remembrance</HI> the Sins of their An∣cestors.</P>
<P>NOR barely is it the Sins of their <HI>Immedi∣ate Progenitors</HI> which they here confess, but they look back unto the <HI>first Times</HI> of their being a free and Distinct People, as you may see at large thro' the <HI>Psalm.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, I would observe the <HI>Repe∣tition</HI> of the Confession; which is <HI>doubled</HI> and <HI>trebled,</HI> to express the <HI>mighty Sense</HI> they had of the <HI>Greatness</HI> of their own Guilt: <HI>We have sin∣ned with our Fathers, we have committed Iniquity, we have done wickedly.</HI> The <HI>same thing</HI> is repea∣ted
<PB N="5" REF="001801_0004_0FB82C6464F906E0"/><HI>over and over</HI> in other words: Yet here is no <HI>Tautologie</HI> or <HI>vain Repetition:</HI> But out of the <HI>Abundance</HI> of the heart the Mouth <HI>pours out</HI> its Confessions: the more to express the <HI>Reality</HI> and Certainty of the thing, and the Shame and Sorrow <HI>felt</HI> on that account: the more to <HI>affect</HI> themselves with the thing, and to <HI>aggravate</HI> it upon themselves.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Doctrine</HI> I would offer is this.</P>
<P><HI>THAT it becomes the Professing People of GOD in their Humiliations and Confessions of their own Sins, and the Sins of their own Time and Generation, to remember mention and bewail also the Sins of their FATHERS and AN∣CESTORS, even in Times long since past.</HI></P>
<P>THAT we should mourn for our <HI>own Per∣sonal Guilts</HI> in the first place, you will easily Acknowledge: <HI>these</HI> should ever lye <HI>nearest</HI> to and <HI>heaviest</HI> upon our Hearts. Jer. 8.6. <HI>I hear∣kened and heard, but they spake not aright, no man repented him of HIS Wickedness, saying, What have I done?</HI></P>
<P>BUT we must mourn for the Sins of <HI>Others</HI> together with our own. Sin ought to grieve us wherever we see it: Psal. 119.158. <HI>I be∣held Transgressors and was grieved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001801_0005_0FB82C66576BD598"/>
IN particular, We should be <HI>Affected</HI> with and <HI>afflicted</HI> for the Sins of the <HI>Time,</HI> the <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> wherein our Lot is cast: Ezek. 9.4. <HI>Go thro' the midst of the City, and set a Mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it may be the <HI>Instance in the Text</HI> has been <HI>less tho't of,</HI> than <HI>These</HI> which I have nam'd: <HI>scil.</HI> That we should bring into our Humiliations and Confessions, as the Sins of our People that <HI>now live,</HI> so the Sins of the Generations <HI>before us;</HI> even their Sins who are <HI>long since dead,</HI> and were so <HI>before we were born.</HI></P>
<P>I will lay before you, 1. The <HI>Demand</HI> of GOD from us to this purpose, and then 2. Consider a little the <HI>Reasons</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>IT is the Will of GOD that we should re∣member and mourn for the Sins of those that are gone before us, and who may have been long since dead, in our penitential and solemn Confessions.</HI> GOD prescribes <HI>This</HI> unto <HI>Israel</HI> by the hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> in the <HI>After-Confessions of Future Ge∣nerations,</HI> and in particular in the <HI>Captivities</HI> which their Sins would bring upon them: Levit. 26.39, 40. <HI>You shall pine away in your Iniquities in the Land of your Enemies, and in the
<PB N="7" REF="001801_0006_0FB82C68E2371FF0"/>Iniquity of your Fathers shall ye pine away: If then they shall confess their Iniquity and the Iniquities of their Fathers,—then will I remember my Cove∣nant.</HI> Now in Obedience to this <HI>Direction</HI> and Command of GOD, the Faithful and <HI>Penitent</HI> in <HI>Israel</HI> did <HI>thus</HI> on every Solemn Occasion: whereof the <HI>Psalm</HI> before us is a copious <HI>In∣stance.</HI> More especially, toward and after the <HI>Babylonish Captivity</HI> (to which some refer the <HI>Psalm</HI>) this was the <HI>Burthen</HI> in the Church's Confessions. So <HI>Jeremiah, Ezra</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> made their Confession in their Day. Jer. 3.25. <HI>We lie down in our Shame, and our Confusion covers us, for we have sinned against the LORD our GOD, we and our FATHERS from our Youth.</HI> Lam. 5.7. <HI>Our Fathers have sinned and are not, and we have born their Iniquities.</HI> Ezra 9.7. <HI>Since the days of our Fathers have we been in great Trespass unto this day.</HI> Nehem. 1.6, 7. <HI>Both I and my Fathers house have sinned: We have dealt very corruptly before thee.</HI> More especially in the <HI>Ninth Chapter</HI> we have a large Account of a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> solemnized by <HI>Nehemiah</HI> and the <HI>Remnant of Judah,</HI> the very Design of which <HI>Solemn Day</HI> is thus declared, <HI>v. 2. The seed of Israel—stood and confessed their Sins, and the Iniquities of their FATHERS.</HI> They were in∣deed then <HI>smarting</HI> for borh together, and could not well <HI>separate</HI> them <HI>v.</HI> 16. <HI>But they</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001801_0007_0FB82C6D06ED0688"/>even <HI>our Fathers dealt proudly, and hardned their Necks, and hearkened not to thy Commandments,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>v.</HI> 34. <HI>Neither have our Kings, our Princes, our Priests, nor our Fathers kept thy Law.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Practice</HI> is Establish'd in <HI>Scrip∣ture,</HI> by Precept and by Example. We find the holy Men of GOD, under the <HI>Inspiration</HI> of the HOLY GHOST, and the special <HI>Influ∣ence</HI> of his Grace, bringing the Sins of their <HI>Ancestors</HI> and of the <HI>Generations</HI> before them, into their <HI>Confessions</HI> before GOD; as well in their <HI>private</HI> as in their more <HI>public</HI> Humilia∣tions.</P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>I will Enquire into the Reasons of this Duty.</HI> It may seem liable to <HI>two Objections,</HI> which I wou'd <HI>premise</HI> two Words to <HI>Obviate.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As if it imply'd <HI>want of Reverence</HI> to our Ancestors,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Irreverence toward GOD.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT implies no want of Reverence to our An∣cestors:</HI> Nor is it to be charged with the Spi∣rit of <HI>graceless Ham,</HI> who was condemned for <HI>not covering his Fathers Nakedness.</HI> We <HI>cannot uncover</HI> the Shame of our Fathers before GOD, to whose Eye all things are <HI>naked and open.</HI> Or if we remember <HI>them</HI> with <HI>Abasement</HI> be∣fore GOD, as well as prostrate our selves in the Dust, it is before <HI>our FATHER in Heaven,</HI> that His Name and Holiness may be <HI>glorified:</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001801_0008_0FB82C6FCBC9D280"/>Whose Honour should be infinitly <HI>dearer</HI> to us than the Name of all <HI>Earthly Parents:</HI> And like <HI>Levi</HI> we must be ready to say unto <HI>Father and Mother</HI> in His Cause, <HI>I have not seen them;</HI> Neither may we <HI>Acknowledge our Brethren, nor know our own Children.</HI> Deut. 33.9.</P>
<P>On the other hand,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is far from implying any Irreverence to∣ward GOD, as if He punish'd us for our Father's Sins.</HI> Far be it from us to take up the <HI>foolish and prophane Proverb</HI> which was sometimes used by the wicked <HI>Israelites:</HI> Ezek. 18.2. <HI>The Fa∣thers have eaten the sour Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are set on Edge.</HI> No: What I am arguing for is just the <HI>Reverse</HI> of this <HI>Blasphemy.</HI> For <HI>they</HI> make an <HI>Objection</HI> of it against the Justice of Providence, <HI>we</HI> on the contrary confess its <HI>Righteousness</HI> herein: <HI>They</HI> make a <HI>fleer and jest</HI> of it as an Absurdity, <HI>we</HI> in solemn manner <HI>Adore</HI> the Soverain GOD in his Dispensation, and <HI>Abase</HI> our selves before Him In profound Humiliation: <HI>They reflect</HI> upon the Divine Government, <HI>we justify</HI> His Administration, and own there is no Hardship done us: for that we know that we shall <HI>never</HI> be punished for our <HI>Fathers</HI> Sins if we do not walk in <HI>their Steps;</HI> and then too only in <HI>Temporal Calami∣ties</HI> (not in the <HI>Eternal State</HI>) wherein GOD will at last have punish'd us <HI>less when our own Iniquities have deserved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001801_0009_0FB82C72DB51AED0"/>
HAVING <HI>premis'd these two things</HI> for the guarding and stating the <HI>Truth</HI> before us, I shall now offer two or three more <HI>direct Rea∣sons,</HI> Why we should confess the Iniquity of our FATHERS together with our <HI>Own</HI> in our Solemn Humiliations.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO repair the more if it were possible the Dishonour done unto the Name of GOD and His holy Law.</HI> For all the <HI>Reparation</HI> which we can make being only in the <HI>Explicit Humilia∣tions</HI> of our Souls on that Account, we do ren∣der the <HI>greater Glory</HI> to the Name of GOD while in our Confessions we do look back to the Sins of our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> as well as Recollect our <HI>Own.</HI> I am sure among <HI>Men</HI> it wou'd be Accounted a very <HI>worthy Action,</HI> if our Parents had done any Injury to a Nei'bour, if We af∣ter their Death should do what we can, and what appears just to us to do them right: And doubtless the <HI>Great GOD</HI> will accept such an Act of Piety and Duty from us toward Himself.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be <HI>our Grief</HI> that our Fathers sinned against GOD, and should we not <HI>say so</HI> before Him? What better <HI>Reverence</HI> can we show unto our Father in Heaven? while we <HI>go backward like the blushing Sons of Noah, drawing a Covering over our earthly Parents Na∣kedness.</HI> Which tho' we wont <HI>look upon,</HI> yet
<PB N="11" REF="001801_0010_0FB82C7686072AC8"/>we know with Concern that it <HI>lies Exposed.</HI> To <HI>whom</HI> do we publish it? to GOD! and <HI>why?</HI> but that HE may be Glorified! Where then is the Trespass on <HI>Filial Piety</HI> by this Act of Devotion and Worship? or did it bear har∣der on the <HI>Names of the Deceas'd,</HI> yet what were <HI>these</HI> to the Honour of the ETERNAL GOD?</P>
<P>IN confessing the Sins of our Fathers we <HI>Adore the GOD of our Fathers;</HI> and in Effect we do but <HI>give Him the Glory of that Relation:</HI> Our Fathers GOD and <HI>we will Exalt thee:</HI> son we do as truly <HI>Exalt</HI> GOD in our Penitent Confessions, as in our Thankful Praises. Ezra 10.10, 11. <HI>Ye have transgressed—Now there∣fore make Confession unto the LORD GOD of your Fathers.</HI> Can we remember Him as our Fa∣thers GOD in our Confessions, and never bring our Fathers Sins into our Confessions? Where then is his <HI>Honour,</HI> and where is his <HI>Fear, as</HI> the Lord GOD of our Fathers?</P>
<P N="2">2. IT becomes us to Confess the Sins of our Fathers with our Own, <HI>to show our Impar∣tiality in the hatred of Sin:</HI> that we grieve and mourn for it <HI>because it is Sin,</HI> Contrary to GOD and abhorred by Him, <HI>without any Respect of Persons.</HI> For <HI>Sin</HI> is the same in it self, and the same in the Sight of GOD, whoever be the <HI>Sinner;</HI> and therefore it is equally to be re∣sented
<PB N="12" REF="001801_0011_0FB82C77E1C0C710"/>by us, as against GOD. Psal. 139. <HI>ult. Am I not grieved with them that rise up against thee?</HI> This is a sincere and upright <HI>Detestation</HI> of Sin, as such.</P>
<P>SOME can freely eno' <HI>fault</HI> Sin in those that are <HI>not related</HI> to them; but O how they <HI>cover</HI> and palliate it when it falls out in their <HI>own House?</HI> This brings the most declared Zeal against Sin under a just <HI>Suspicion</HI> in any One; while it turns to another for a <HI>Testimony</HI> of their Impartial Regard to the Honour of GOD, when they are not brib'd by their Re∣lation unto any to justify them in Sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is but just for <HI>a wicked Posterity</HI> to joyn the Sins of their <HI>Ancestors</HI> with their own in their Confessions, <HI>because they are actually Partakers with them in their Iniquity.</HI> Indeed <HI>this</HI> is too much the <HI>Course</HI> of this World in the several Generations of it, <HI>Posterity learn and retain the Vices of their Ancestors.</HI> As <HI>one Generation</HI> corrupt themselves it is a pretty sure way to make the <HI>Next</HI> worse. A People are hardly bro't to <HI>reform</HI> the Errors of their <HI>Predecessors,</HI> which they are <HI>Educated</HI> in, and suck in with their <HI>Mothers Milk.</HI> So <HI>Israels Apostacy grew</HI> on the succeeding Generations after the Death of <HI>Joshua,</HI> and again after the Reigns of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI> Judg. 2.10, 19. <HI>There arose another Generation which knew not the
<PB N="13" REF="001801_0012_0FB82C7B5CFA3680"/>LORD;</HI> but the next after them <HI>returned and corrupted themselves more than their-Fathers.</HI> The <HI>Prophet</HI> supposes it to be sometimes the happy Case of particular Persons, <HI>that the Son seeth all his Fathers Sins which he hath done, and consi∣dereth and doeth not the like.</HI> Ezek. 18.14. And GOD forbid that <HI>this</HI> should not be often <HI>Ex∣emplified;</HI> and to GOD be the <HI>Praise</HI> whene∣ver it is so. But the Contrary is usually the Case of a Degenerate People. Posterity <HI>inherit</HI> their Fathers Manners, and are <HI>fix'd</HI> in evil Customs by the Practice and Example of An∣cestors, and sometimes may <HI>receive their Errors with Reverence.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if the People of <HI>our Age</HI> retain the Evils of the <HI>last,</HI> and carry Impiety to a grea∣ter Length than it was before our time, have we not made our Fathers Sins <HI>our own</HI> with a witness? <HI>Truly,</HI> as our <HI>Saviour</HI> said to the <HI>Jews</HI> in His Time. Luk. 11.48. <HI>Ye bear wit∣ness that ye allow the Deeds of your Fathers.</HI> That is, <HI>They</HI> did by the <HI>Prophets</HI> then, as their <HI>Fa∣thers</HI> had done long before; They were <HI>Impe∣nitent</HI> and <HI>Obstinate</HI> in Sin as their Fathers had been under the Ministry of former Prophets; they were of the same <HI>persecuting Spirit</HI> that their Fathers had been of: So <HI>their Fathers Sin was Theirs</HI> and both to be confessed in the same Breath.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="001801_0013_0FB82C7C66E369F0"/>
IT was the <HI>folly</HI> of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and their <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> that they cou'd confess their Fathers persecution of the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>not discern their own.</HI> It may be the Error may seem <HI>less</HI> if we confess our own faults, and not our Ancestors. But that our Confessions may be perfect we must <HI>Omit neither.</HI> As the <HI>Martyr Stephen</HI> made Confession for the <HI>Jewish Rulers,</HI> since they wou'd not do it for themselves: Act. 7.51. <HI>You stiff-necked and Uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the HOLY GHOST; As your Fathers did so do ye: Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the Coming of that JUST ONE, of whom ye have been now the Be∣trayers and Murderers.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. TO Confess the Sins of our <HI>Fathers</HI> with our own <HI>may be of special Influence to keep us from them, or to Convince us of them, and put us the more zealously upon the Reforming and Amend∣ing them, that the Wrath of GOD may be turned away from us.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO keep us from them:</HI> that if we are not fallen into their Sins we may not: for what more Effectual way is there for the <HI>Preven∣tion</HI> of Sin than a sincere penitential Confe∣ssion of it; which binds the Soul not to do it 2. Chron. 30. <HI>And be not ye like your Fathers and like your Brethren, which trespassed against
<PB N="15" REF="001801_0014_0FB82C7DEAD5D9D0"/>the LORD GOD of your Fathers,—Now be not ye stiff-necked as your Fathers were.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OR surely it must the more Convince us of and humble us for our own Sins,</HI> if we have sin∣ned after the <HI>Similitude</HI> of the Sins of our Fa∣thers which we confess. It must leave us <HI>Self-judged</HI> and condemned. Our own <HI>Lips</HI> do then fall upon us, and our own <HI>Tongue</HI> rises in Judgment. The Guilt of a People is greatly Aggravated, and the Offence to GOD rises exceedingly, when the Sins of Ancestors are retained. A People may not be ready to Ap∣prehend this; but GOD will have them Con∣vinced of it. Jer. 16.10, 11. <HI>What is our Ini∣quity? or what is our Sin that we have commit∣ted against the LORD our GOD? Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your Fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD,—and ye have done worse than your Fathers.</HI> If this will not convince a People what can! Mal. 3.7. <HI>Even from the days of your Fathers ye have gone away from mine Ordinances—. Antiquity, Usage</HI> and <HI>long Cus∣tom</HI> is so far from Extenuating the <HI>Apostacy,</HI> that it aggravates it. Mat. 23.32. <HI>Fill ye up the Measure of your Fathers.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IF we are Convinced of and Humbled for the Sins of our Fathers found among our selves, <HI>we shall reform and forsake them as well as confess 'em.</HI> So <HI>Hezekiah</HI> gathered the <HI>Priests
<PB N="16" REF="001801_0015_0FB82C80F0F2AF78"/>and Levites</HI> together, and said unto them; <HI>Our Fathers have trespassed, and done that which was Evil in the Sight of the LORD,— Now it is in my heart to make a Covenant with the LORD GOD of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn from us.</HI> 2 Chron. 29.6, 10.</P>
<P N="4">4. And lastly. <HI>GOD will turn away his Wrath from and mercifully pardon such a People, as peni∣tently confess and reform their own and their Fa∣thers Sins.</HI></P>
<P>ON the one hand it is most Certain, that a Peoples persisting impenitently in their Fa∣thers Sins does heap up Guilt, and treasure up Wrath, from Generation to Generation, and at last brings down fearful Destructions on them. Isa. 65.7. <HI>Your Iniquities and the Ini∣quities of your Fathers together,— which have blasphemed me—: therefore will I measure their former Work into their Bosom.</HI> Very pathetical are the <HI>Expostulations</HI> to this purpose: Jer. 44.7, 9. <HI>Wherefore commit ye this great Evil against your own Souls, to cut off from you man and wo∣man, child and suckling out of Judah, to leave you none to remain—? Have ye forgotten the wick∣edness of your Fathers—? they are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law.</HI> And again, Ezek. 20.30, 36. <HI>Are ye polluted after the manner of your Fa∣thers? Surely—with fury poured out—will I plead with you—.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001801_0016_0FB82C8339FE67B0"/>
BUT now the <HI>Entail of Wrath</HI> is as certain∣ly <HI>cut off,</HI> if a people repent of and reform the Sins of their Fathers, and do not <HI>relapse</HI> into them, nor have any like Provocations of their own. <HI>Josiah</HI> wou'd have saved <HI>Judah</HI> from Ruine, after all their Apostacies and Impeni∣tence, if his People would have done and been like Him: He <HI>rent his Clothes</HI> when he heard the Words of the Book of the Law,—<HI>for great is the Wrath of the LORD that is kin∣dled against us,</HI> said he, <HI>because our Fathers have not hearkned to the Words of this Book:</HI> Where∣upon he sent and gathered unto him all the Elders of <HI>Judah</HI> and of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and went up with them in a Solemn Assembly <HI>into the House of the LORD,</HI> and there caused to be read in their hearing all the Words of the <HI>Book of the Covenant:</HI> And the <HI>King</HI> there and then publicly <HI>Covenanted</HI> before the LORD, <HI>to walk after the LORD, and to keep his Com∣mandments, and his Testimonies, and his Statutes, with all their heart and all their Soul,— and all the People stood to the Covenant. i.e.</HI> Declar'd their Consent to it and bound themselves to keep it; which had they <HI>indeed stood to, Jeru∣salem's</HI> Destruction wou'd not have come on so soon after. See 2 King. 22. &amp; 23. <HI>Chapters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THESE</HI> are some of the <HI>Great Reasons</HI> why a People in confessing their own Iniquity,
<PB N="18" REF="001801_0017_0FB82C8550BD6298"/>should confess also the Sins of their FA∣THERS. I will Conclude with a few pro∣per <HI>Inferences</HI> from the <HI>Premises.</HI></P>
<P>USE 1. Hence I infer, <HI>That in our Con∣duct and Actions we should always consider that we act for POSTERITY.</HI> The Influence of our Principles and Practices reaches to <HI>them.</HI> Therefore we should by no means limit our Tho'ts meerly to our selves and our own Times, when we are regulating our own Be∣haviour. If we of <HI>this Age</HI> are wicked, we hurt not only the present, but <HI>Ages to come.</HI> Not only those who are now Alive and see our ill Example, but those too who are not yet born may be much prejudiced by our ill Conduct. And on the other hand, If we are Vertuous and Religious, we serve not only our own Generation, but those that come af∣ter us, it may be to many Generations. For this Reason and on this View let us desire so to live that <HI>Posterity</HI> may not be the worse for us, but the better. That they may not be Miserable thro' our fault and come to curse us, but that our Memory may be dear and precious, Venerable and blessed to them. That our <HI>Childrens Children</HI> may not be Asha∣med of us, and remember us only in their Confessions and <HI>Abasements;</HI> but also some times in their <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> to the Glory of
<PB N="19" REF="001801_0018_0FB82C8719AD9BC0"/>GOD with Reverence and Esteem. Psal. 22.4, 5. <HI>Our Fathers trusted in Thee, they trusted and Thou didst deliver them; they cried unto thee and were delivered, they trusted in thee and were not Confounded.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. IF we ought to confess the Sins of our Fathers, then <HI>pious Fathers should bewail the Sins and degeneracy of their Children, and be afflicted and abased before GOD in the prospect and fear thereof.</HI> This is a very natural Grief to Holy Hearts, and alas too commonly is there Oc∣casion given for it. The fear of this gives a very <HI>painful Concern</HI> to Them that bear us, and if they live to see <HI>it</HI> it brings down their <HI>grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.</HI> Like <HI>old Eli</HI> they sit <HI>trembling</HI> for the <HI>Ark</HI> of GOD in the hands of their <HI>Ungodly Off-spring.</HI> Tremble they do for their <HI>Sons,</HI> to think what will be∣come of them; but much more for the <HI>Name</HI> and Honour of GOD that suffers by them, and which is more to them than the <HI>Lives</HI> of their Children. So faithful <HI>Moses</HI> took a sor∣rowful <HI>Leave</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> on the knowledge of their past Sins, and foresight of those to come: He even confess'd and bewail'd 'em before those were born that did commit 'em: Deut. 31.27, 28, 29. <HI>For I know thy Rebellion and thy stiff neck: Behold while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been Rebellious against the
<PB N="20" REF="001801_0019_0FB82C8B5E43ECC0"/>LORD; and how much more after my Death? Gather unto me all the Elders of your Tribes, and your Officers, that I may speak these Words in your Ears, and call Heaven and Earth to Record against them. For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt your selves, and turn aside from the Way which I have commanded you; and Evil will befal you in the latter days, becouse ye will do Evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to Anger—.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IF we shou'd confess their Sins who are gone before us, <HI>then whatever has been Amiss in our Fathers we should reform.</HI> I have <HI>no Accu∣sation</HI> to bring against the FATHERS of my <HI>Country,</HI> whose Memory is Blessed with us; and with <HI>Whom</HI> we may not compare our Selves, being <HI>risen up a sinful Generation</HI> in their place; A more <HI>mixt People,</HI> and acting more on <HI>worldly Views, Maxims and Customs.</HI> Yet <HI>They</HI> were far from pretending to <HI>Perfection,</HI> They were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en subject to <HI>Passions and Errors.</HI> And while we Venerate their <HI>Devotion,</HI> and ought to Imitate their <HI>Vertues,</HI> we should take care not to be <HI>misled</HI> by their Example in any thing <HI>Amiss</HI> in them; <HI>receiving it by Tra∣dition</HI> from them.</P>
<P>IF in the Begining of the <HI>Country,</HI> in any Places they founded their <HI>Churches</HI> on <HI>too nar∣row</HI> a Bottom, and in too much <HI>Independency</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="001801_0020_0FB82C8F1595ECB8"/>one upon another, their <HI>Posterity</HI> have done well to <HI>Enlarge the Foundation,</HI> and those are to be pitied who will charge this with <HI>Aposta∣cy.</HI> For certainly we have at last too many <HI>Unbaptised Persons</HI> among us, and it is a Grief to have the <HI>LORD's Table so neglected,</HI> as it is among us at this day.</P>
<P>IF there be any <HI>Customs</HI> in our Churches derived from our <HI>Ancestors,</HI> whereby those <HI>Terms are Imposed</HI> in order to the <HI>Admission</HI> of Persons to the LORD's <HI>Table,</HI> which CHRIST hath not imposed in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> such <HI>Impositions</HI> ought to be laid aside. For they are justly to be Condemned, especially in <HI>US,</HI> because <HI>we do complain</HI> of Impositions in other <HI>Communions,</HI> and our <HI>Fathers sled</HI> from the same.</P>
<P>IF there ever was a <HI>Custom</HI> among us, where∣by <HI>Communion in our Churches</HI> was made a TEST for the Enjoyment of <HI>Civil Priveledges in the State;</HI> the <HI>Natural</HI> Rights of Men and the <HI>Legal</HI> Rights of <HI>English Men,</HI> without re∣spect to one Church State and Communion or another, consistent with the public Peace and Safety of the <HI>GOVERNMENT;</HI> we have done well long since to <HI>Abolish</HI> any such <HI>corrupt and persecuting Maxims:</HI> Which it is a <HI>Mischief</HI> to any free People and a <HI>Scandal</HI> to any Com∣munion of <HI>Christians</HI> to retain.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001801_0021_0FB82C910DB94288"/>
IF there were of old among our Fathers any <HI>Laws Enacted,</HI> or at any time any <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> given and <HI>Executions</HI> done according to those Laws, which have carried too much the <HI>Spirit and Face of Cruelty and Persecution;</HI> we ought to be <HI>Humbled greatly</HI> for any such Er∣rors of our Fathers, and confess it to have been sinful in them. And blessed be GOD for the more <HI>Catholic Spirit of Charity</HI> that now distinguishes us.</P>
<P>IF there ever was among our Fathers any Grounds for that <HI>gross Accusation</HI> which has been made by some against them; but I am ready to believe was a <HI>Slander</HI> and <HI>Calumny</HI> unjustly cast upon their Memory, because I have heard the same <HI>Accusation</HI> made most unjustly in some particular <HI>Cases</HI> against our <HI>Judges</HI> now alive; If (I say) there has been <HI>open Partiality</HI> in doing Justice and Judgment, out of respect of Persons, because of our own Communion or <HI>way of Worship;</HI> GOD forbid that the least of <HI>this Leven or Tincture</HI> should be found among us.</P>
<P>OR if any of our Fathers have even <HI>dealt too proudly</HI> in <HI>Censuring and Judging</HI> others that differ'd from them in Modes of Worship; let us their Posterity the rather be clothed with <HI>Humility, Meekness</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> preserving <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> with the laudable Zeal of our <HI>Predecessors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="001801_0022_0FB82C9240E64150"/>
<HI>Finally,</HI> IF we and our Fathers before us have been guilty of <HI>Negligence in Gospelizing the Heathen</HI> as we might have done; or if the <HI>Fund</HI> for that Service might have been more <HI>faithfully and wisely Applied</HI> than it sometimes had been; (which also has been often <HI>said</HI> to our Dishonour) I am sure that <HI>Those</HI> concern∣ed in that <HI>Affair,</HI> as well as all of <HI>Us</HI> in our <HI>several Stations,</HI> should be quickned to consi∣der, what the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD and <HI>Compassion</HI> to Souls calls for at our Hands.</P>
<P>I might add, If any of our <HI>Fathers</HI> may have sometimes seem'd <HI>too Strict</HI> in Judging others for <HI>lawful Liberties;</HI> I hope it will find an <HI>easy pardon</HI> with Them that look on the <HI>Licence</HI> taken by many in our <HI>own Times.</HI> Some few did <HI>so</HI> in their day, but They <HI>Insti∣tuted</HI> them better both by <HI>Precept</HI> and <HI>Example;</HI> and to their Praise be it spoken—<HI>We never receiv'd the Immoral Practices of the Present Gene∣ration from Them:</HI> They never learnt us to be profane, disobedient to Parents, dishonest in our dealings, unclean, false, selfish, covetous and worldly. Which leads me to say,</P>
<P N="4">4. IF we should be ready to confess the sins of our Fathers, <HI>then whatsoever was Good and Worthy in Them should be also remembred, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, prais'd and Imitated by us.</HI> Our Reve∣rence to GOD and Man commands this of us,
<PB N="24" REF="001801_0023_0FB82C93C8C1D240"/>and it is one Instance of our Obedience to the <HI>first Commandment with Promise, Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</HI> If there be any <HI>Vertue,</HI> if there be any <HI>Praise,</HI> think of <HI>these.</HI></P>
<P>OUR <HI>Fathers</HI> had their <HI>Infirmities</HI> no doubt, but they had their <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Integrity.</HI> They were a Company of <HI>brave and honest Men.</HI> Not many <HI>Wise men after the flesh,</HI> not any of the <HI>Mighty and Noble</HI> were among them; but neither were they any of the <HI>base</HI> and <HI>vile</HI> of the <HI>Nation</HI> for outward <HI>Estate</HI> or <HI>Character.</HI> They were for the Body of them Serious and <HI>Godly Christians;</HI> Men <HI>rich in Faith</HI> and <HI>Heirs</HI> of a better World. For that <HI>better Country</HI> they left their pleasant <HI>Native Land,</HI> and in remov∣ing into a <HI>Wilderness</HI> mostly for Religion's sake, they declar'd plainly that they <HI>fought</HI> it.</P>
<P>THEY came over on a most <HI>worthy</HI> De∣sign, on the <HI>Noblest</HI> Motives, and with the <HI>best</HI> Intentions. <HI>Pare and Undefiled RELIGION</HI> was their proposed <HI>End,</HI> and their <HI>Support</HI> in their Undertaking. Their first Care was to <HI>plant Churches</HI> rather than <HI>Towns,</HI> and <HI>Schools and Colledges</HI> as soon as they saw Towns In∣crease, to leave a <HI>learned MINISTRY</HI> and Religion in the <HI>Power of it</HI> to their Posterity. <HI>Government</HI> and good Order was as much their Care as <HI>Liberty of Conscience;</HI> not using Liberty
<PB N="25" REF="001801_0024_0FB82C951ECDAE60"/>for an <HI>Occasion to the flesh,</HI> but standing fast in that <HI>wherewith CHRIST hath made us free.</HI></P>
<P>THEY have jest us their <HI>Testimony</HI> for the <HI>purity of GOD's Worship</HI> according to the In∣stitution of <HI>Scripture,</HI> without the Additions of men; and against Will worship and Super∣stition Formality and Hypocrisy. They have Instituted us in the strict Observation of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> which has been the Honour of these <HI>Churches,</HI> and as it decays is our <HI>real Apostacy</HI> from vital Religion. They have commended to us strict <HI>Family Government,</HI> and the <HI>good Education</HI> of our Children, which was our <HI>own Happiness</HI> under their wise and faithful Care. They taught us by <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> what the. <HI>Grace of GOd, which brings us Salvation teacheth; to deny Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live Soberly, Righteously and Godly in this present Evil World: to honour all Men, to love the Brotherhood, to fear GOD, and to honour the King.</HI> They have left us the noble Example of a <HI>Public Spirit,</HI> to love our Country, to act for Posterity, and seek the Good of After-Gene∣rations.</P>
<P>SUCH a sort of Men were the <HI>Founders and Fathers</HI> of our Country: Men <HI>of whom the World was not worthy,</HI> tho' they were <HI>plain men,</HI> but not wanting in <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Learning, Prudence, Integrity</HI> and true <HI>Devotion,</HI> I should
<PB N="26" REF="001801_0025_0FB82C9A8F5D45F8"/>have said too what a <HI>Stock of Prayers</HI> they laid in for us, which have bro't down many Ble∣ssings on us already, and we hope will many more on the Generations yet to come.</P>
<P>[NOR may I omit to mention, with how much <HI>Humanity</HI> and a truly <HI>Christian</HI> Zeal they had at heart and labour'd for the <HI>Civilizing,</HI> the <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Natives.</HI> The Names of <HI>Eliot</HI> and <HI>Mahew</HI> are made Im∣mortal with us on this Account, and their <HI>Rest is Glorious.</HI> They did the part of <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Evangelists</HI> with a truly primitive Spirit. The <HI>Government</HI> treated the <HI>barbarous people</HI> with many Courtesies and Obligations. Un∣known Labours were used and pains taken with them to Acquaint them with the Ways of GOD. The <HI>Bible</HI> with vast pains and dili∣gence was <HI>Translated</HI> into the <HI>Indian Tongue</HI> and printed for their Use, and distributed among them. They were preach'd to, they were argued with and Entreated. An <HI>Indian Colledge</HI> was built, some of their <HI>Children</HI> with much difficulty put to <HI>School,</HI> and <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> have been bro't up at the <HI>Colledge,</HI> but <HI>died</HI> there.</P>
<P>WHAT tho' the <HI>Success</HI> has not answered the pious hope Intention and Prayers of our Fathers? their Piety is never the less Con∣spicuous, and their <HI>Reward is with GOD</HI> tho
<PB N="27" REF="001801_0026_0FB82C9D214424D0"/>the <HI>Salvages be not gather'd.</HI> What tho' they might have taken <HI>wiser Methods,</HI> some may think; They did what appear'd to them best, and what cost 'em more Expence and fatigue it may be, than the other proposed Methods would have done. And what tho' there were <HI>Neglects</HI> too of <HI>some Parts,</HI> and even some of our own <HI>Plantations</HI> were setled in too <HI>heathen∣ish a manner:</HI> Never the less if much of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Presence</HI> of GOD had not been with our <HI>Fathers,</HI> they had never done half the Great and Good things they did.]</P>
<P>THIS is but a small piece of <HI>Justice</HI> to their Memory, and to excite our <HI>Emulation.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. And lastly, IF we should consider the faults of our <HI>Ancestors</HI> to confess them, <HI>then how much more ought we to bewail our own Sins, and the Sins of our own Day.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>OUR own Personal Transgressions and Guilts.</HI> Without <HI>these</HI> the Sins of others gone before us would not hurt us much. <HI>The Soul that Sins shall die: The Son shall not bear the Iniquity of his Father,</HI> if he considereth and doeth not the like. Ezek. 18.14.</P>
<P>LAY thy hand then upon thy heart, and smite there for thy own Abominations. For these GOD will judge thee in the last Day. And this it is that He looks for to day from thee, that thou feel the <HI>plague of thy own heart,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="001801_0027_0FB82C9ED78141F8"/>and so spread forth thy hands toward his house. For what hast thou to do to confess the Sins of others, who art not Affected with thy own? <HI>Thou Hypocrite, pull first the Beam out of thine own Eye.</HI> Repent thee of thy own Wickedness, and say, <HI>What have I done?</HI> When I speak of Sinners, am I not <HI>the Chief?</HI> But what is my own <HI>Repentance</HI> this day before the LORD? Am I <HI>humbled</HI> for and bewailing my own Sins? have I <HI>reformed</HI> these yet? do I <HI>keep my self from mine own Iniquity?</HI> Psal. 51.2, 3. <HI>Wash ME thro'ly from MINE Iniquity, and cleanse ME from My Sin; for I acknowledge My Transgressions, and My Sin is ever before me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>LET us lay to heart the Sins of our Day and Time.</HI> Whether those of our <HI>Land,</HI> or of our <HI>Nation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Sins of our Land.</HI> We are sadly on the decay as to serious Piety and vital Reli∣gion. We have lost our first love, life and zeal. <HI>Our FATHERS where are they?</HI> their Spirit of Devotion! their Sobriety and Tem∣perance! their <HI>Godliness and Honesty!</HI> Sensuali∣ty, worldliness and Pride are grown up in the place of these; profaness, lukewarmness and Hypocrisy; Selfishness and Unrighteousness. Our Fathers would be ready to <HI>disown</HI> us on these Accounts, and we ought to think how they will <HI>rise up in Judgment</HI> against us and
<PB N="29" REF="001801_0028_0FB82C9FA125FA28"/>condemn us. Let us consider from <HI>whence we have fallen and repent.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Work <HI>to day</HI> is to bewail the <HI>present de∣generacy</HI> and corruption of our People. Isa. 58.1. <HI>Shew my People THEIR Transgression, and the House of Jacob their Sins.</HI> Let us therefore bring <HI>our Peace-Offerings,</HI> as repenting <HI>Judah</HI> did, and <HI>make Confession to the LORD GOD of our Fathers▪</HI> 2 Chron. 30.22.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>LET us lay to heart the Sins of our Nation, the place of our FATHERS Sepulchers.</HI> And here a <HI>dismal Scene</HI> opens of such Iniquity, as I hope is <HI>not yet known</HI> among us; how soon soever it may <HI>threaten us</HI> if not reformed there. For be∣sides <HI>Formality</HI> in Religion, <HI>Sensuality, profaness, injustice, worldliness, pride, covetousness,</HI> &amp;c. whereof we have our share; there are yet <HI>grea∣ter Abominations</HI> glaring there; Such as <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Infidelity,</HI> and <HI>open Contempt</HI> of all that is most <HI>Sacred,</HI> not only expressed in <HI>Dissolveness</HI> of life, but also in <HI>public Conversation</HI> &amp; in <HI>Writings.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Venerable Name</HI> of Religion and of the CHURCH is made a <HI>Sham-pretence</HI> for the worst of <HI>Villanies:</HI> for all <HI>Uncharitableness</HI> and unnatural <HI>Oppression</HI> of the pious and peaceable, for <HI>slanders lies and falshoods,</HI> for <HI>Divisions hatred and Animosities,</HI> for <HI>Bribery and Perjury,</HI> for <HI>Dis∣loyalty</HI> and <HI>Perfidy,</HI> for <HI>Tumults, Mutinies and Rebellions,</HI> for all <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to GOD &amp; <HI>Treason</HI> against the KING and our Country.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="001801_0029_0FB82CA197077A30"/>
THE <HI>perilous Times</HI> are come, wherein Men are <HI>Lovers only of their own Selves,</HI> sacrificing the <HI>Public</HI> to their own private <HI>Gains and Am∣bition, without natural Affection, Truce-breakers, false Accusers, Incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are Good; Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of GOD, having a form of Godliness,</HI> and multitudes not <HI>that</HI> nei∣ther. <HI>From such turn away,</HI> says the Holy <HI>Apostle:</HI> And I pray GOD to <HI>purge</HI> the <HI>Court, Nobility and Magistracy</HI> of this plague and <HI>leprosy;</HI> and not the <HI>Court</HI> only, but also the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>Clergy,</HI> the <HI>Universities</HI> and <HI>Accademies,</HI> as well as the <HI>Camp</HI> and <HI>Fleet;</HI> that the Spirit of <HI>Par∣ties</HI> and <HI>Factions</HI> may not increase unto more <HI>Ungodliness,</HI> and to all <HI>Barbarities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah Calamitous Day!</HI> whereinto we are fallen, and into which the Sins of an <HI>Infatuated Age</HI> has bro't us. <HI>Hear this, Ye old Men, and give ear all Ye Inhabitants of the Land!</HI> hath this been in <HI>your days?</HI> or even in the days of <HI>your Fathers? They are a Nation void of Counsel, neither is there any Understanding in them! as if their Rock had sold 'em, and the LORD had shut them up. O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they wou'd consider their latter End!</HI> that at least when their <HI>Judge cometh</HI> there may be <HI>some Faith and Charity</HI> found in the <HI>Land.</HI></P>
<P>AND doubtless there is <HI>some</HI> among Profes∣sors of every Denomination. But O <HI>how want∣ing</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="001801_0030_0FB82CA59FC7B248"/>among every party of men. However I am very glad that I can do our <HI>United Brethren in Great Britain,</HI> and this <HI>Country</HI> too the Honour and the Justice as to say, That in this time of public <HI>Treacheries, Perjuries, Rebellion</HI> &amp; <HI>Treason,</HI> not a <HI>dog</HI> can wag his tongue to charge us with <HI>Disloyalty,</HI> Undutifulness or Disrespect to <HI>Govern∣ment,</HI> or want of <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> to the PRO∣TESTANT SUCCESSION, the peaceful <HI>Reign</HI> of the KING, &amp; the true Interests of the Nation as to their <HI>Civil and Religious Rights.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed it is an <HI>Amazing</HI> thing, and one wou'd think Incredible, that any <HI>Protestant</HI> or Mem∣ber of the <HI>Church of England</HI> should be in the <HI>late Rebellions</HI> against his <HI>present MAJESTY,</HI> to set up a <HI>popish Pretender</HI> whom they have so often and justly <HI>Abjured.</HI> It is as the <HI>right Reve∣rend the Bishops</HI> say Excellently in their late <HI>pious and loyal Declaration,</HI> <Q>so vile and dete∣stable a thing as may justly make 'em Odi∣ous to GOD and man. And at the same time to pretend a zeal for the Church of <HI>England</HI> is such an Imposition on the common Sense of Mankind, that nothing even in Popery it self can be more Absurd: And nothing but an Infatuation from GOD, justly infli∣cted for our Sins can suffer it to pass upon the Nation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Wherefore, in the Name of GOD, those <HI>most Reverend Persons</HI> do call upon the Na∣tion,
<PB N="32" REF="001801_0031_0FB82CA98B3ED090"/>in the first place to humble themselves before GOD for the Great and crying Sins of the Nation; for that Spirit of Infidelity and Libertinism; of Unthankfulness for the Mercies of the Gospel; of Formality and Hypocrisy, of Strife and Envy, of Hatred and Animosity, which are so rife in it, and generally the Forerunners of the Destru∣ction of any People.</Q></P>
<P>Blessed be GOD for this <HI>Seasonable and True Testimony</HI> of these FATHERS in the Church. They have here said what the Body of the <HI>Dissenting Ministers</HI> have long tho't and <HI>said often Weeping,</HI> but <HI>in vain.</HI> The Atheistical and Immoral part of the Nation are the Source of its Miseries and Dangers. GOD heal its Sins and Breaches. GOD make the <HI>Bishops</HI> of the Church its Healers. And GOD grant that we may <HI>see the things of our Peace before that they be hid from our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>I pray GOD that the Day may come when We may no longer <HI>hate to be reformed,</HI> and that the KING may live to be the <HI>Glorious Instru∣ment</HI> in the Hand of GOD of our <HI>Reformation</HI> in every Respect. So may HE be <HI>blessed,</HI> and His <HI>Throne Established before the LORD for Ever.</HI></P>
