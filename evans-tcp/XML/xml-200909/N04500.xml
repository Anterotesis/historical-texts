<P>Blessed be the Lord, for He hath shewed me his marvellous Kindness in a strong City.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Title shews that this is a Psalm of <HI>David,</HI> who was one of the greatest Saints, and the most accomplished General of the Age; he spead his Conquest far and wide, he was an early and renowned Hero, and as he grew in Experience, and a more extensive Command, he became more
<PB N="2" REF="005584_0006_10269258E63952F8"/>remarkable and Illustrious. His Kingdom at first was mainland Territory, without any Sea-Port or Navigation, but by his Conquests he extended his Dominions from Sea to Sea, even to the River that is from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> to the Red-Sea, and to the River the great River <HI>Euphrates;</HI> so that what was said of the City of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> on another Occasion, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11.45. by way of Allusion, may be applied to <HI>David, And he shall plant the Tabernacles of his Palace between the Seas in the glorious holy Mountain.</HI></P>
<P>We have an Account of <HI>David</HI>'s Conquests and Victory's, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> 1, 2, 3. <HI>And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Metheg-ammah out of the Hand of the Philistines. Metheg-ammah,</HI> that is the Bridle of <HI>Ammah,</HI> or according to our modern Way of speaking, a Key of the Country, as <HI>Pelusium</HI> was to <HI>Egypt,</HI> and as <HI>Louishourg</HI> is to <HI>Canada.</HI> V. 2. <HI>And he smote Moah, and measured them with a Line, casting them down to the Ground: Even with two Lines measured he to put to Death, and with one full Line to keep alive.</HI> Ver. 3. <HI>David also smote Hadadezer the Son of Rehob, King of Zobah, as he went ot recover his Border at the River Euphrates.</HI> Ver. 5. <HI>When the Syrians of Da∣mascus came to succour Hadadezer King of Zobah, David stew the Syrians Two and twenty Thousand
<PB N="3" REF="005584_0007_1026925CACF863E0"/>Men.</HI> Ver. 6. <HI>And David put Garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became Ser∣vants to David, and brought Gifts; and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.</HI> He conquered <HI>Edom,</HI> and in him was fullfilled what was prophesied of old concerning the Posterity of <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and <HI>the elder shall serve the younger,</HI> This was not true of <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> personally, but we see it was so in the Posterity of <HI>Esau,</HI> for we read, Ver. 14. <HI>And he put Garrisons in Edom, throughout all Edom put he Garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's Servants:</HI> He made an entire Conquest, and treated them as People reduced, or bro't into Subjection: By this Acquisition he laid himself open to the red Sea, and became pos∣sessed of those two famous Sea-ports or Har∣bours, viz. <HI>Elath</HI> and <HI>Ezion-Geber:</HI> By his Conquest and Trade he amassed great Riches so as to be able to provide for the building of the Temple, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 22.14. <HI>Behold now in my Trouble I have prepared for the House of the Lord an hundred thousand Talents of Gold, and a thousand thousand Talents of Silver, of Brass and Iron without weight.</HI> This Gold and Silver according to the common Account of a Talent is in Quantity so great, as Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> observes, that if it were melted down into a Mass it would be more than the hollow Content of the Temple, or as big as the Temple it self: This being
<PB N="4" REF="005584_0008_1026925E37043698"/>a very extraordinary Representation, some have endeavoured to solve the Difficulty by saying that it is probable that we do not know exactly what a Talent is; but this Solution doth not seem sufficient to remove the Diffi∣culty; for in the first Place the amount or greatness of the Sum arising from the known Quantity of what a Talent makes, is the Dif∣ficulty: We would remove this Difficulty by saying, that we may be mistaken about a Talent, or that we don't know what a Talent is. What seems to be a rational and probable Answer to this Objection is, that whereas we find in the account of these matters, that there is a careful Distinction maintained in the Scrip∣tures between Gold and fine Gold; by Gold we are to understand Gold in the Oar, and fine Gold is Gold when purified or refined; it is probable that when the Ships were sent to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they might dig the Oar, stow it in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and resine it there, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the shortest and most natural Way we can think of: The best Oars both of Gold and Silver, yield but one sixth Part of refined Silver or Gold; when it is considered in this Light, this reducing it to one sixth Part brings it down to such a Sum as one may rationally suppose that a Prince who had made many Conquests, and carried on a great Trade, might provide and lay up for a Design in
<PB N="5" REF="005584_0009_1026926011B0A7F0"/>which his Heart was much engaged: But to return from this Digression: <HI>Solomon, David</HI>'s Successor, increased and enlarged the Trade still more, he sent great Fleets, and made vast Returns, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 10.22. <HI>In his Days Silver was nothing accounted of, for the King had at Sea a Navy of Tarshish with the Navy of Hiram, once in three Years came the Navy of Tarshish, bringing Gold, Silver, Ivory, and Apes and Peacocks: So King Solomon exceeded all the Kings of the Earth for Riches and for Wisdom:</HI> And Ver. 27. <HI>And the King made Silver to be in Jerusalem as Stones, and Cedars made he to be as the Sycomore Trees, that are in the Vale, for abundance. Jehosaphat,</HI> and those other Princes who retained their Dominions over <HI>Edom,</HI> continued the Eastern Trade from those Ports of <HI>Elath</HI> and <HI>Ezion-Geber;</HI> so long they continued to make a considerable Figure in the World; but when they lost this Naviga∣tion, and were reduced to an inland Trade, they then declined in Power and Wealth, in∣creased in Sin, and abounded in Iniquity, were dependant on, and tributary to others. It may be laid down as a Rule, that ordinarily no Kingdom, State or Province will ever ad∣vance to any considerable Degree of temporal Greatness, Polity, Power and Influence, with∣out Trade and Navigation: It was this, together with the Situation natural and artificial
<PB N="6" REF="005584_0010_10269261D66575A0"/>Strength of <HI>Tyrus</HI> of old, that rendered that Place so remarkable and conspicuous in Scrip∣ture History.</P>
<P>What was said of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> may in some Measure be applyed to that Place of great Strength, which has been lately Surren∣dered; for which we come together this Day to bless the LORD for his marvellous Kindness shewed in the Reduction of such a strong City, <HI>Ezek. 27.3. Say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the Sea, which art a Merchant of the People for many Isles, thus saith the LORD GOD, O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect Beauty: Thy Borders are in the midst of the Seas, thy Builders have perfected thy Beauty.</HI> And, Ver. 25. <HI>The Ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy Market, and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the Seas.</HI> And with the Regard to the great Fishery of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> and Trade arising from that Manufacture, we may apply what was said of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> Ver. 33. <HI>When thy Wares went forth out of the Seas, thou filledst many People, thou didst inrich the Kings of the Earth, with the multitude of thy Riches and of thy Mer∣chandise.</HI> It is remarkable what GOD has done for us in putting into our Hands such a strong Place happily situated for Trade and Naviga∣tion, to defend our selves, and annoy our Ene∣my: This Fortress being surrendered to our
<PB N="7" REF="005584_0011_10269264DA4E2950"/>Rightful Sovereign Lord King GEORGE, those more immediately concerned in the Under∣taking, having had full Success under the Conduct of Divine Providence, which has ap∣peared in a Chain or Series of connected Acts of marvellous Kindness; this will naturally fix us to the Words of our Text, and excite us to say, <HI>Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewed us his marvellous Kindness in a strong City;</HI> in the Original it is, <HI>fenced City;</HI> or, as we say a fortified Placè: It is not consistent with a com∣mon Course of just Reasoning to suppose the holy Psalmist has Reference to some divine Meditations and Reflections upon GOD'S Dis∣pensations towards him in a State of Peace, when at Ease in the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but rather that it was GOD'S marvellous Kindness to him in an Expedition against some strong forti∣fied Place; it is probable that it was penned on that Occasion when his Forces under <HI>Joab</HI> invested the strong City of <HI>Rabbah,</HI> and under his own Conduct the City was reduced and taken: This was a memorable Siege, it was the Capital of the Kingdom of <HI>Ammon,</HI> they carried the War into the Bowels of that King∣dom, and besieged <HI>Rabbah,</HI> for we read, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. <HI>v.</HI> 1. <HI>David</HI> sent <HI>Joab</HI> when it was a fit Season to take the Field, and his Servants with him, <HI>and they destroyed the Children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah:</HI> The Circum∣stances
<PB N="8" REF="005584_0012_10269267DA79EC70"/>of the Story, and many Things trans∣acted in the Time of this Siege, evidenceth that they lay encamped long, and that it was an Attempt full of Danger, for we read that the Shooters shot from the Wall: The Re∣duction of this Place was a Thing of great Im∣portance, and of so much Glory that <HI>Joab,</HI> who was a great General, and inured to Victory and Conquests, yet wisely thought it best to send for the King to come and take the Honour of reducing the City, so <HI>Joab</HI> when he had cut them off from Water, and saw the Siege in a hopeful Way to succeed, sent for the King to come with a Reinforcement, as we may see 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.26, 27. <HI>And Joab fought against Rabbah and the Children of Ammon, and took the royal City: And Joab sent Messengers to David, and said, I have sought against Rabbah, and have taken the City of Waters: Now there∣fore, gather the rest of the People together, and encamp against the City, and take it: Lest I take the City, and it be called after my Name.</HI></P>
<P>It is probable that in this Dispensation of Providence, he had seen and experienced the marvellous Kindness of GOD in the Reduction of this strong City.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE,</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>That when GOD hath shewed us his marvellous Kindness, in conducting and</HI> succeeding <HI>our late military Expedition against the Enemy, especially in the Reduction of their strong City, we ought to bless the LORD for such signal Favours.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. 1. That GOD hath shewed us his mar∣velous Kindness, in conducting and succeeding our late Expedition in the strong City.</P>
<P>PROP. 2. That for such marvellous Kindness, we ought to be very thankful, and bless the LORD.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD hath shewed us his marvellous Kind∣ness in what concerneth the late Expedition, by disposing the Minds of the Country to ingage in that Affair with such Ardor and Zeal.</HI> When the Expedition was projected and set on foot, the chief of our Colonies, and His Excellency Governour <HI>Shirley,</HI> who under GOD, was the Spring of that Motion, when he sent his Pro∣posals, with a general Plan of the Operation to the other Governments, publick Bodies and private Persons appeared mightily disposed to engage in the important Affair; thus it may be said as with Respect to King <HI>David,</HI> in a great
<PB N="10" REF="005584_0014_1026926B559C8C08"/>Affair he had to transact, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.14. <HI>And he bowed the Heart of all the Men of Judah, even as the Heart of one Man.</HI> High and Low, Rich and Poor concurred in the same Senti∣ment; if any were otherways disposed, yet they were borne down with the strong Torrent of a general Inclination.</P>
<P>If the upper Orders of Men had not concur∣red, the Expedition must have failed; if the lower Ranks of Men had not been strongly en∣gaged, the grand Design must have come to nothing: So that we see that the Head cannot say to the Foot, I have no need of you: All Orders and Degrees of Men were so united that there was no Schism in the Body.</P>
<P>Such was the united Inclination of People in <HI>New-England,</HI> that notwithstanding the great Charge of such an Undertaking, and their own Poverty, yet as the Apostle saith, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.2. <HI>Their deep Poverty abounded unto the Riches of their Liberality: For to their Power (I bear Record) and beyond their Power, they were willing of themselves.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another Instance of GOD'S marvellous Kindness in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <HI>That what was Concerted and Projected here, was Acceptable and well Approved by the gover∣ning Powers in</HI> GREAT. BRITAIN: We found favour in the sight of the King and His Nobles.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005584_0015_1026926F1B2E9A58"/>The Packquet-Boat had a safe Passage, altho' it was in the depth of Winter; the Messenger had a favourable Answer from the Board, and (as we have hèard) was dispatch'd in Twelve Hours; Ships were ordered to assist in that Expedition. But what is an Instance of marvellous Kindness was this, That before that time, Commodore <HI>Warren</HI> (whose coming was agreeable to the Wishes and united Desires of the whole Country) had received Orders to come with his Squa∣dron of Ships here to this Country; had this Order been sent after the Messenger sent from hence did Arrive, it must in the common course of Things, have been too late; had the Enemy's Store-Ships entred and supply'd the City, this would have rendred the Reduction of the Place difficult, if not impracticable: The Ship <HI>Vigilant</HI> was large, in all probability it would have proved that her Sides were too thick, and her Metal too heavy for our small Shipping. That the <HI>Commodore</HI> should be Ordered hither before our designed Epedi∣tion was known to them who gave that Order, is a wonderful Providence; it is GOD'S Wis∣dom and not Man's that did direct: <HI>This is the LORD'S Doings, and it is Marvellous in our Eyes,</HI> Psal. 118.23.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="005584_0016_102692719FD6E8D0"/>
3. Another Instance of GOD'S marvellous Kindness, was, <HI>That the Affair was managed and carried on with such Secresy, that it was not known to the Enemy, nor so much as sus∣pected.</HI> Very much of the Affair was concer∣ted, agitated, and carried on in the Winter Season, in a dead Time of the Year, when there is but little Communication either by Sea or Land: Yet after all, we and our Ene∣mies being upon the same Continent, it is of GOD'S Kindness, nay, it is an Instance of his <HI>Marvellous</HI> Kindness that this important Design was hid from them; it was hid from them even a long time after the Expedition was over, so that after the strong Place was Sur∣rendred, they came boldly there as to their own Home; were Ensnared and Taken with∣out having opportunity to strike one Stroke: Their case was not unlike to that of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> of whom the Prophet said, <HI>Smite them with blindness,</HI> 2 King. 6.18. — <HI>And He smote them with blindness, — And he said follow me; but he led them to Samaria, and they saw and be∣held they were in the midst of Samaria.</HI> That an Affair of this nature, known to so many, about which there must be many imployed, and so much done in Preparation for the Ex∣pedition, it is marvellous that the Enemy did by no means come to the Knowlege of it; when it was commonly said among our selves,
<PB N="13" REF="005584_0017_10269273681951E0"/>That the Enemy knew it 'ere this time: One saith to another, The <HI>English</HI> can never keep a Secret! Well, I believe that before this time, that the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> know all the Affair as well as we. But GOD hath dealt with us not only better than we deserve, but even better than our fears: there∣fore we may say, <HI>Blessed be the LORD, who hath shewed us his marvellous Kindness in a strong City.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Another Instance of marvellous Kind∣ness in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <HI>The fitness of the Weather for such an Under∣taking.</HI> It was fine Weather for a long time beyond what was usual at that time of the Year, nay, beyond what was ever known. In ordering the Season, human Skill fails, and Strength can do nothing: It is GOD who commands the Winds and the Seas and they obey him. Had not GOD had the Winds in his Fist, and bound up the Waters as in a Garment, how difficult, how dangerous the Navigation? Had GOD <HI>sent,</HI> nay, had he not prevented the usual Storms of the Season and the Roughness of the Sea, a great Fleet of Transports must have been greatly Exposed: Had not GOD appeared for them, that must have been their case, which we find painted in such lively Colours, <HI>Psal.</HI> 107.25. <HI>For he
<PB N="14" REF="005584_0018_10269276C69D0228"/>commandeth and raiseth the stormy Wind, which lifteth up the Waves thereof; they mount up to Heaven, they go down again to the Dephts; their soul is melted because of Trouble? they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunked Man, and are at their wits end.</HI> Our Forces were not only favoured with good Weather in their Passage, but also when they lay Incamped, which was a marvellous Kindness; especially considering the early Season, the coldness of the Climate and the length of the Siege: And what is very remarkable, immediately upon the Surrendry of the Place, the Heavens gathered to blackness, Rain and Cold: Stormy Weather and Goggs was in abundance, and continued long such, as would have rendred the Encampment much more incommodious and difficult. These were such Instances of marvellous Kindnesses, as our Enemies could not but take Notice of; so that we may say, <HI>Their rock is not as our Rock, even our Enemies themselves being judges, Deut. 32.31.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Another Instance of GOD'S marvellous Kindness in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <HI>That most of the Land Army who under∣took this great Enterprize, had not practical Knowlege in the Arts of War.</HI> Incamping, Intrenching, erecting Batteries, Bombarding and Cannonading, was what they had not been
<PB N="15" REF="005584_0019_102692791744E0F0"/>acquainted with; yet being used to turn their Hands to many sorts of Work, they soon un∣derstood what was to be done: If they had not so much skill as regular Forces, yet they had one prime Qualification, they engaged with Resolution and good Will; they were able-bodied Men, able to endure Labour and Fatigue; they perform'd their duty as Sol∣diers, and did that work which would have imployed many hundred Pioners: They were near to a Country that could supply them with a sufficiency of good, strong and wholsom Food, by which they were kept in heart and high spirit. That this is of great importance, we have the Opinion of the best of Judges of his time, Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> who was wont to receive supplies of Soldiers from <HI>England,</HI> of whom he said, he found it best to bring them to Engage the Enemy before the <HI>English</HI> Beef was dissolved in their Bellies; finding by Ex∣perience that when they fed on cold and weak Diet, they lost much of their Vivacity and Courage. All these advantages are from Him who is the Author of all good: It was He that instructed an undisciplin'd Army, so that they might say with the Psalmist, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.1 <HI>Thou hast tought my hands to War and my fingers to Fight.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="16" REF="005584_0020_1026914D30080D10"/>
6. Another Instance of GOD'S marvellous Kindness in the late Expedition, was, <HI>The Har∣mony, Unanimity and good Agreement between the Sea and Land Forces.</HI> Different Powers make different Claims: There are points not fully setled in the oldest and best established Constitutions as to the extent of Prerogative and Liverty; the extent of Maritine of Ad∣miralty Powers and that of Civil: But in this Undertaking against the Enemy, there was an happy Concord, no Jealousie or Emulation; the Sea and Lond Forces were ready to afford each other mutual Help and Assistance: How happy and how useful is such Agreement? Like that of <HI>Joab</HI> and <HI>Abishal,</HI> when <HI>Joab</HI> found himself beset before and behind; he made a double Front, then he makes a short military Oration, enough to warm the hearts and invigorate the minds of every one, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.11. <HI>And be said, if the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; if the Children of Ammon be too hard for thee, then I will come and help thee: Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the City of our GOD, and let the LORD do what seemeth him good.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Another Instance of GOD'S marvellous Kindness, is, <HI>The protection and salvation of GOD in preserving our Forces from the Shot
<PB N="17" REF="005584_0021_1026938EAC878940"/>of the Enemy.</HI> All the Opposition they made at the Landing of our Men was ineffectual and insignificant: Notwithstanding all the advan∣tage of Ground, the loss they sustained was greater than the damage they did. GOD in his great Mercy so ordered it, that when they expected our Men to Land in one place, they Landed at another place, only because it ap∣peared a better place; which quite disconcerted the Measures and defeaned the Design of the Enemy. At the time of the Siege, when the Shooters shot from the Wall, it is wonderful that they did no more Execution: How shall we speak of it but in the Language of the Psal∣mist? <HI>Psal.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice; let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: With favour thou wilt compass them as with a shield.</HI> Psal. 140.7 <HI>O God the LORD, the strength of my salvation; thou hast covered my head in the day of hattel.</HI></P>
<P N="8">Another Instance of marvellous Kind∣ness of GOD in this important Affair, was, <HI>The Health that he afforded to our Army and Pleet.</HI> It is no uncommon thing for Fleets and Ar∣mies, especially if they ly long Incamped, to suffer more <HI>from the Pestilence that walketh in darkness, and the destruction that wasteth at noon-day,</HI> than from the Sword of the Enemy. This we sorrowfully experienc'd at <HI>Wood
<PB N="18" REF="005584_0022_102693904240A130"/>Creek</HI> some Years past. What is marvellous Kindness indeed, is this, that by the Sword of the Enemy, by the Sea, and by Sickness and all Accidents, we did not loose more Lives, than out of such Number, of which the Fleet and Army did consist, in such a space of Time we have lost at home when it hath not been ac∣counted a very sickly Time; sometimes out of such a Number and in such a space of Times, it is probable that we have lost many more: So that we may say, <HI>GOD hath shewed his marvellous Kindness in a strong City.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Soldiers gone upon that Expedition with never so much Resolution and good Will, yet if they had been Sick had lost their Strength, they could not have sustained the Burthen and performed Labour nècessary to be done; but having Health, Strength and good Will, they went through all with Chearful∣ness: For as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> said of their great Works at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> such as were the Wonder and Envy of those round about them; he gives this Reason for the uncommon progress they made, Neh. 4.6. <HI>So built we the Wall; and all the Wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</HI></P>
<P>The time would fail to mention all the particular wonders of Providence, either with respect to the Expedition in general, or what occurr'd to Parties or particular Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005584_0023_1026914FA585D1D8"/>The <HI>French</HI> Deserting and Evacuating the Grand Battery, a place of great Strength, whatever induced them to it, whether a scar∣city of Men, or a Panick that seised them; whatever was the Cause, happy were the Ef∣fects, and great the was the Joy on our part.</P>
<P>The happy success of our Cruisers and Ships of War, in preventing the Enemy in the City from receiving Supplies of Food, Naval or Warlike Stores, was another marvellous Kindness conferred on us.</P>
<P>The Bombs broke so near to our Men as to cover them with dirt, yet did them little harm.</P>
<P>The whole Affairs is so replete with Wonders, accompanied with such a train of Providences in what was antecedent or preparatory, in the time of Action, and what hath happed since to our Advantage and to the prejudice of the E∣nemy: That were not the Facts a well known Truth, the whole would appear more with the air of a Romance, than a true History.</P>
<P N="9">9. Another Instance of marvellous Kind∣ness, was, <HI>That the full Strength of the Place was unknown to us.</HI> When the great Undertaking was set on foot, it was supposed that the Place was Weak and but slenderly Fortified on the Land-side; so that it was thought that it might be Reduced by a Land Army: The Wall was represented on that part as low and unfinished,
<PB N="20" REF="005584_0024_10269393C0BEF6B8"/>which was an Encouragement to ingage in the important Affair; and may serve as a just Vin∣dication of the Project from any charge of Rash∣ness: But when our Men saw the full Strength of the Place, the heighth of the Walls, the depth of the Ditch, its solid Foundations and great Thickness; its Furniture to Offend, and the ample Provision made to Defend the Place, the Art and Skill with which every part was contrived and done, they were filled with won∣der, like the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 10.4. And when the Queen had seen all <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Wisdom and the House he had built, there was no more spirit in her; for she said, <HI>Behold, the half was not told me.</HI></P>
<P>As GOD sometimes confounds the Wisdom of the wise; here in this Affair, GOD in his marvellous Kindness, hath turn'd our Igno∣rance and Unacquaintedness with the true state of the Place to our advantage.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Lastly,</HI> Another Instance of marvellous Kindness is this, <HI>That GOD hath graciously heard our Prayers, which have been incessantly put up, and done all these great Things for us, notwithstanding our many repeated Provocations and Offences.</HI> When we consider our Un∣thankfulness for Mercies received, our Un∣fruitfulness under gospel Means and Advan∣tages, our Deadness and Formality, Prophane∣ness,
<PB N="21" REF="005584_0025_10269396C7595CE8"/>Injustice, Intemperance; when Iniquity doth so much abound and the Love of many waxeth cold, GOD'S Kindness is to be consi∣dered as so much the more Marvellous.</P>
<P>At that time when GOD was working Won∣ders for <HI>David,</HI> subjecting to him the strong City of <HI>Rabbah, David</HI> had Offended greatly in the matter of <HI>Urich the Hittite;</HI> so that when he was brought to a due sight and sense of that great Sin; the goodness of GOD in doing such great things for him, might raise in him so much the more exalted Thoughts of GOD'S marvellous Kindness in what related to the Reduction of that strong City.</P>
<P>PROP. 2. <HI>That for such marvellous Kindness we ought to bless the LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We should bless the LORD in Humility. We should rejoice with trembling: For he that hath lift us up may cast us down, and turn his hand against us all the day long. Let us be thankful and give all the glory to GOD, <HI>Psal.</HI> 115.1. <HI>Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory, for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake.</HI> Oh! Let us not say, This is the fruit and effect of <HI>New-England</HI> Courage. Let us not say our own Arm hath given us the Victory. Let us learn a lesson of Humility and Thankfulness, from <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.3. <HI>For they
<PB N="22" REF="005584_0026_102693985C688988"/>got not the land in possion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm save them; but thy right Hand and thine Arm, the light of thy Coun∣tenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. For I will not trust in my Bow, neither shall my Sword save me: For thou hast saved us from our Enemies, &amp; hast put them to shame that bated us. In GOD we beast all the day long and praise thy Name for ever at dever.</HI> King <HI>David</HI> had Mi∣litary Skill himself, had a number of Worthy's that were famous for their Courage and Skill in War; he also took care to have his Subjects instructed in military Discipline, 2 Sam. 1.18. <HI>Also he had them teach the Children of Judah the use of the Bow.</HI> The Soldiers having fallen before the <HI>Philistines,</HI> sunk in their Courage, &amp; defective in military Skill, he makes it his first care to have them trained and instructed. It is true, Mr. <HI>Meade</HI> observes, in the Original it stands thus. He bad them teach the Children of <HI>Judah</HI> the <HI>Bow;</HI> he conjectures, that the fol∣lowing Elegy being a martial Song, was called the Bow which he would have them learn. But the sense of the Translators is the most national and natural. After all his Skill in and Con∣cern about military Skill, yet he did not trust in an Arm of Flesh, but made GOD his Confi∣dence and Shield. The more humble any are, the more thankful they will be. <HI>Jacob</HI> said, <HI>I am less than the least of all Mercies.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="005584_0027_1026939A039C87B0"/>2. We should bless the LORD at all Times and with all our powers and faculties, Psal. 34.1. <HI>I will bless the LORD at all times, his praise shall be continually in my mouth.</HI> Bless him when alone and in Company; diligently Re∣count these marvellous Things to our Chil∣dren, Talk of them when we sit in the House and when we walk by the Way, when we are Assembled (as at this Day) <HI>we should Praise him in the great Congregation.</HI></P>
<P>If it be our duty to bless GOD in the time of our Affliction, as <HI>Job</HI> did, <HI>The LORD gives, and he takes away, blessed be the Name of the LORD;</HI> Let us bless him when he is loading us with his Benefits and incompassing us with the blessings of his Goodness. <HI>Bless the LORD in the great Congregation.</HI> Let us not only speak, but live his Praises. If we are truly Thankful, we shall be chearfully Obedient.</P>
<P>We may <HI>Improve</HI> this in a Use of EXHOR∣TATION, if we can need any <HI>Exhortation,</HI> beyond what the present Occasion offers.</P>
<P><HI>Oh! Let us bless the LORD, who hath given us the Victory, and that with so little Effusion of Blood.</HI></P>
<P>At a Council of War, it was Resolved in a short time to Storm the Place; GOD merci∣fully prevented this, by a Capitulation and
<PB N="24" REF="005584_0028_1026939C78BF6F70"/>Surrender of that strong Hold. Had they been obliged to make a general Assualt by Sea and Land, in which whole Ranks might have been cut down and multitudes torn in pieces, this would have damped our Joy, and been a sad Alloy to all our Pleasure: It would have been with us, as with them at the Re-building of the Second Temple, the voice of <HI>Weeping</HI> and <HI>Rejoicing</HI> blended together. Oh! Bless the LORD for his marvellous Kindness in a strong City: For this place being Reduced,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Island belong'd Originally to the <HI>British</HI> Em∣pire: Was at first compriz'd in the general Name and grand Patent of <HI>New-England</HI> in 1620; but in the following Year was set off and included in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> by a separate Event: and since, in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> comprehended in the Royal Charter of the <HI>Massachu∣setts</HI> Province in 1691.</NOTE> our natural Enemy the <HI>French,</HI> have not one Sea-port on the Continent on this side the Bay of <HI>Mexico.</HI> Bless the LORD and make him our Boast all the day, since by GOD'S gracious Aid our Enemy's are Subdued who Threatned, with their Ships to sweep our Seas and main∣tain their Fires with Jack-staves taken from us. But blessed be GOD, who hath given us to say with the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psal. 18.40. <HI>Thou hast also given me the recks of mine Enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</HI></P>
<P>We shall conclude this <HI>Use</HI> of Exhortation to Thanksgiving and Praise, with only Three
<PB N="25" REF="005584_0029_102693A042D89F58"/><HI>Motives,</HI> which we find all laid together, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.1 <HI>Praise ye the LORD, for it is good to sing praises unto our GOD: for it pleasant, and praise it comely. Good, Pleasant</HI> and <HI>Comely.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is Good:</HI> There is a real Goodness in it. <HI>Psal.</HI> 92.1. <HI>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy Name, O most high.</HI></P>
<P>The ways of GOD'S Providence in the Expe∣dition have been such and so remarkable, that the Ignorant and Prophane, Careless and Irre∣ligious, are obliged to own that this is the singers of GOD; and shall not the Righteous bless his holy Name? If it be so good to give Thanks, will good Men be ungrateful? Nay, that is a Contradiction; <HI>Unthankful and Evil</HI> go toge∣ther. Shall all Nature speak forth the high Praises of GOD, and shall we be silent? Let our Mouths be filled with the high Praises of GOD; <HI>for it is a good thing to give Thanks unto the LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Consider by way of Motive, <HI>That it is Pleasant.</HI> Grief compresseth the heart, and therefore is an uneasie thing: But Joy dilates and expands the Soul; is therefore attended with pleasing Sensations. A Soul sen∣sible of his own Sin and Unworthiness, and yet enjoying the Overflowings of divine Goodness, and hath his Mind proportionably drawn out in Thankfulness, enjoys Happiness and hath a
<PB N="26" REF="005584_0030_102693A1D006B8E0"/>true taste of Pleasure. Must it not be plea∣sant, since singing Praises to GOD in the happy Imployment and Entertainment of Angels and the spirits of just Men made perfect, and will be so to all Eternity. If therefore it were not pleasant, Heaven would be no Heaven, but a place of Confinement and Uneasiness.</P>
<P N="3">3. To excite to Thankfulness by way of Motive, consider, <HI>That Praise is Comely.</HI> What is beauty or comeliness, but a just pro∣portion and due disposition of Parts? where there is no Symmetry or just proportion of Features, there is what we call <HI>Homeliness:</HI> If so, then Ingratitude is not only uncomely, but even monstrous. An ungrateful, unthankful Person, makes a frightful Figure; is abhorr'd by GOD and Man. Since GOD has done so much for us in the great Deliverances he has wrought, we can do no less in decency and duty, than offer up to Him a tribute of Praise due to him. Let us all join together and bless his holy Name: <HI>Both young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children, let them Praise the Name of the LORD; for his Name alone is Excellent, his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven, and Praise is Comely.</HI> The most unexceptionable Evidence of true Gratitude, and that we are Thankful for his marvellous Kindness, is, <HI>That we yield to Him sincere, chearful and universal Obedience.</HI></P>
